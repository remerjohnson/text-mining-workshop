Students reach a 
compromise with 
administration 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
News Editor 

Dimensions of Culrure lecrures 
remained full while Marshall Field, 
the site of a proposed walkout, was 
largely vacant of rallyists on Friday. 
The walkout of Thurgood Marshall 
College residents from their D.O .C. 
classes was averted as part of a com-
promise between the dean's office 
and srudent organizers. 

The rally was changed to an 
information session to rectify 
reports of what some students 
allege to be the unfair treatment of 
Marshall residents. The informa-
tion session was the result of talks 
between Dean of Student Affairs 
Ashanti Houston-Hands :ll1d 
UCSD Cause organizer Danny 
Leibowitz. Leibowitz and his suite-
mates created UCSD Cause as part 
of their campaign to increase the 
rights of Marshall residents. 

"This is a toned-down version of 
what we were going to do," 
Leibowitz said, referring to the 
information session held at Marshall 
Field, which consisted of Leibowitz 
and his fellow organizers handing 
out fliers to interested students. 

"I certainly respect the students' 
right to protest and to hold infor-
mation sessions. I never like to see

Cynthia Gorney of UC Berkeley'S 
graduate school of journalism and 
was broadcasted from UCTV's stu-

Scripps professor

• • prestigious spots 
Orcutt to head AGU and 
serve on presidential staff 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

John Orcutt, professor of geo-
physics at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, has been voted pres-
ident-elect of the American 
Geophysical Union. He will assume 
the presidency of the 39,OOO-mem-
ber organization July 1, 2004. 

"It pleases me greatly," Orcutt 
said of the news. "It's a great honor 
to be elected for an organization 
with so much history. There have 
been some great presidents of the 
AGU over the course of 50 years." 

The AGU is a nonprofit organi-
zation established in 19 19 by the 
National Research ounci!. It has 
operated for the pa t 50 years as an 
unincorporated affi li ate of the 

ational Academy of Sciences. 

One of Orcutt's top priorities as 
AGU president will be converting 
written forms of research to elec-
tronic publications. 

"The AGU is more than 100 
years old and it has published the 
results of its research on paper," 
Orcutt said . "We've just made the 
transition to electronic form whil e 
continuing paper form , but that 
transition is very expensive, so sell -
ing this idea of electronic publish-
ing is not trivial given these 
increased co ts." 

Orcutt al 0 added that if the 
transition were to fai l, it would be a 
disaster, becau e the GU depends 
on income from publications to a 
large extent. Nevertheless, he does 
not foresee this to be a problem.

,\; for his thoughts on the furure, 
Orcutt sa id he is optimistic of the pos-

"He has an extremely distin-
guished record," 1inster said. "It was 
no surprise. I think he's extremely 
well -respected and has the devotion 
of everyone at the IGPP." 

Dr. Mark Zumberge, deputy direc-
ror of the San Diego branch of the 
IGPP, agrees. 

"It's going to be very good for the 
AGU becau e he's an excellent 
leader," Zumberge said. "He has high 
standards of scientific integrity and he 
just sets a great example of how to be 
productive in the world of science." 

Orcutt is a fellow of AGU and a

The U.S. Conunission on Ocean

of 2000, an act that reviews the effects 
of federal ocean-related laws and pro-
grams. This federal legislation requires 
the comrnission to make findings and

Scripps professor finds warming trend in oceans 
Sara Gille of UCSD's Scripps Institution of 

Oceanography has documented an increase in 
water temperature that has occurred over the past 
50 years in the sea region surrounding the 
Antarctic continent known as the 'Southern 
Ocean:' 

Since 1950, a 0.17-degree Celsius increase was 
found in the 700- to 1, loa-meter depth range, near-
ly doubling the global average. According to Gille, the 
implications of warming In the Antarctic region 
include the probable reduction of sea ice around the 
Antarctic continent, which could potentially alter the 
sea levels of water bodies worldwide. Because cold 
water holds carbon dioxide more efficiently, the tem-
perature rise could have an adverse effect on the 
earth's atmosphere, forcing it to store more green-
house gases. 

A fleet of marine 'robots' deployed by the World . 
Ocean Circulation Experiment in the 1990s obtained 
the evidence for Gille's report. The robots, known as 
Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorers, were 
released into different oceanic regions and at val)'ing 
depths for 10 to 25 days. After gathering tempera-
ture data, the ALACE surfaced to transmit the Infor-
mation to a satellite. Gille used thousands of AlACE 
data points in her research. 

Gille's study was sponsored by the National 
Science Foundation and can be found in the Feb. 
15, 2002 issue of the journal Science.

uc announces naming of new 
head of University Lil:iraries 

UC President Richard C. Atkinson announced the 
appointment of Daniel Greenstein as the new uni-
versity librarian and executive director of the 
California Digital LibraI)' last week. Greenstein cur-
rently acts as the director of the Digital Library 
Federation in Washington, D.C. 

Effective May I, 2002, Greenstein will assume 
the management of . a digital libral)' project that 
boasts content and selVices ranking among the 
largest in the United States. The CDL is a joint pro-
gram between the to UC campuses, and it concen· 
trates on building increased access to content and 
selVices electronically for the academic community. 
Greenstein will also be responsible for library plan-

. ning for the entire UC system. 
Greenstein began his academic career as a 

senior lecturer in modem history at Glasgow 
University. It was at Glasgow that he became found-
ing .director of the university's Arts Faculty Computing 
FaCility. In 1996, he was apPOinted founding director 
of the United Kingdom's Arts and Humanities Data 
Service. 

The article "Revelle luncheon honors city's first black firefighters," which appeared on Feb. 7, 
incorrectly credited Jessica Birchler, the Revelle Cultural Network and the Revelle College Council 
as organizing the Revelle Black History Soul Luncheon. While Birchler was on the committee that 
organized the event, she was not solely responsible for it. Housing and Dining Services was the cor-
rect sponsor of the event. Kyra Randall and Davell Jackson also assisted in organizing the luncheon.

Seaside prohibition reduces 
trouble and underage drinking 

By MARY ONELIA ESTUDILLO 
Staff Writer 

In the upcomi ng March primary elec-
ti on, voters wi ll have to decide wh ether 
they want to ban alcohol at some San 
Diego beaches 24 hours a day, as opposed 
to the current ban, which prohibits alcohol 
from 8 p.m. to noon. T his measure, which 
wou ld affec t Pacific Beach and Mission 
Beach, is known as Proposition G. 

You arc prob~bly thinking, "Now I 
wo n't even be able to enjoy a simple drink 
at the beach? P %# that." There's more to 
it th an th at, and you know it. 

Alcohol in crowded public parks and on 
bcache creates major public sa fety prob-
lems: underage drinking, drunken driving, 
violence, vand alism and other di stur-
ba nces. # 

I t is no wonder that every major beach 
communi ty in Southern California except 
Sa n Diego prohibits alcohol consumption 
on th e sand. \-" hil e to some people, prohi -
bition may seem li ke a crusade against the 
wtl es o f alcoho l, to Jllany it is an issue of 
pub lic safety and quali ty o f life. It 's not to 
pu nish those who bring champagne as a 
parr of a romantic beach picnic or t110se 
who bring a cooler on a ho t summer day to 
enjoy a cold one. Proposition G is there to 
ensu re beachgoers a safer and Jllore pleas-
ant place to hang ouI. 

The beach ha become the underage 
scene for drinking. Why? Beca use it's ea y. 
Underage dri nker can come out to the 
beach and ask unsuspecting beachgoer for 
a sharc of thei r boozc or keg, and just like 
that, they leave, havi ng acquired alcohol 
without identifi cation. 

According to the Policy Panel on Youth 
Access to Alcohol and The San Diego Union-
Tribune, 733 minors were caught in posses-
sion of alcohol in Mission Beach and 
Pacific Beach in the last two years. Only 
seven adults were charged for distribution 
to minors. Of course, that doesn't include 
the statistics for other San Diego-area 
beaches or other alcohol-related arrests. It 
definitely doesn't include the minors whose 
alcohol exploits go undetected. 

In the last three years, police have made 
17,393 arrests and citations for alcohol -
rel ated violations in those areas . This com-
prises over one-third of all of San Diego's 
alcohol-related violations in that period. 
According to research by Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving, 1,361 of these citations 
were for drunk driving and 2,583 were for 
minors in possession of alcohol. According 
to San Diego City Council statistics, the 
92109 ZIP code, which encompasses the 
areas to be affected by Proposition G, has 
the highest percentage of drunken driving 
arrests in San Diego. 

On busy holiday weekends in Mi ssion 
Beach and Pacific Beach, 50 or more police 
officers are often assigned to beach patrol 
- officers that could be protecting your 
neighborhood and making more meaning-
ful arrests. 

In 1991 , when La Jolla Shores Beach 
wa made alcohol- free, reported crimes 
dropped 80 percent and arres ts dropped 43 
percent. By contrast, in 2000, 18 police 
officers were injured in the line of duty in 
Mission Beach and Pacific Beach due to 
alcohol-related violence.

Outlawing beach alcohol punishes Icon 
all for the indiscretion of a few 

By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Last summer, my wife and I had a little 
rirual that we would repeat once or twice a 
week. After work, around 7 p.m., we would 

. grab a couple of beach chairs, a small table, 
Brie, pite, bread and a bottle of wine, and 
we would head to Mission Beach. There, we 
would set up our things and sit, eating 
cheese and pate, drinking a glass or two of 
wine, watching the sunset and talking about 
our day. 

If voters approve San Diego's iii-con-
ceived Proposition G in March, then this 
summer we will be unable to repeat the 
same ritual : Drinking alcohol will be banned 
at Pacific Beach and Mission Beach. 

My wife and I are Italian, and drinking a 
glass of wine together has always been not 
only a necessary complement to al\Y decent 
meal - even beforc' researchers found out 
that a moderate amount of red wine is good 
for your health - but an indispensable ges-
ture of closeness, Why, then, is San Diego 
trying to ban such a harmless family activi-
ty? What happened to the defense of family 
values? 

The. principal explana tion for the ban 
seems to be that drinking on the beach caus-
es undesirable consequences such as drunk-
en driving, public urination and all sorts of 
noisy and disgusting behavior. 

There is some tntth in this - 1 will cer-
tainly not go on the record as a defender of 
public urination - but three things should 
be kept in mind . 

First, these behaviors concern a tiny 
. minority of the drinker; mo t people. con-
suming alcohol at the beach just want to 

drink something refreshing on a warm day 
without resorting to disgusting, sugary, car-
bonated drinks (which, alas, nobody wants 
to ban). 

Second, in the communities for which 
the proposition is pertinent, there are so 
many bars that it is doubtful that a ban on 
beach drinking would eliminate the prob-
lems constituted by drunken people. 

Third, and most important, the afore-
mentioned disgusting behaviors are already 
illegal. Police should stop the people who 
eng<lge in such activities without taking 
away the chance for people like me to enjoy 
a beer or a glass of wine on the beach. 

If we want to play the game of banning 
things because of the possible consequences 
of abuse, we should at least play it consis-
tently. Nearly everything that can be used 
can also be abused. According to the logic of 
the proponents of Proposition G, those 
things should be banned. 

This manifestly does not happen, so I 
feel quite confident in saying that sOCiety is 
not in the habit of banning things just 
because of the possible consequences of 
their abuse. Why is alcohol different? 

The answer is in the puritanical compo-
nent of American culture, which has always 
been at odds with alcohol. This attitude 
stems from rl:te puritan stance that every-
thing enjoyable in life must be a sin . 
Pursuing this line would lead me too far, so 
let me return immediately to alcohol. 

In the United States, every event deemed 
"for families" has a strict no-alcohol policy; 
families and alcohol are not supposed to 
mix. Based on this premise, I heard support-

... until it infri nges on somehody 
else's. 

On a personal level, 1 lind this 
attitude quite offending. My famil y 
mixed very we ll with wi ne, and we 
considered it an essential CO IllPO-
nent of every fa mily gathering. G o 
vis it any of my aunts, and they will 
immediately pull out a plate of bis-
cotti and some fantasti vinsanto, 
roughly 18 percent alcohol, with-
out thinking that such an act clash-
es with family closeness. On the 
contrary, they would believe that 
doing so reinforces family close-
ness by repeating a welcoming ges-
tufe that generations o f aunts have 
made before them. 

Knowing family history helpful for health, peace of mind 
By SUE FORE 
Contributing Writer 

I am adopted, and [ believe 
that all adoption clinics should 
provide registries for adopted 
children. Adoption clinics 
throughout the United States 
have decided to keep their 
records completely closed to 
adoptees, leaving them no way of 
contacting their biological par-
ems. Such a ruling is unfair to 
those who have b.een adopted. 
After all, we have the right to 
know the details of those who 
brought us into existence. 

I was adopted through the 
Gladney Center for Adoption in 
Fort Worth, Texas, a home 
where young mothers can have a 
child in an educational environ-
ment and decide for themselves 
whether they wish to care for the 
child after its birth. 

Gladney has been party to 
several court trials in the process 
of deciding whether children 
given up to adoption should be 
allowed to retrieve information 
on their biological parents. 
Recently, it chose to keep all 
records c1assi fied . 

If it had ended there, [ would 
have been quite upset. I want 
more information on my biolog-
ical mother. 

It's nor that I don't like my 
ad optive parents. But there are 
days when I just want to look like 
someone r know, days when I 
want to be able to say, "I have her 
hands." 

Fortunately for me and many 
o thers, Gladney has open ed a 
registry that adoptees. may join 
upon turning 18 years old . If 
either biological parent decides 

to join as well, then counseling 
and a meeting between the two 
parties can ensue. This way, no 
one is forced upon the other. 

The majority of adoption 
agencies have no such registry 
and no such means for adopted 
people to take any step toward 
satisfying the deep curiosity 
inside. 

There are excellent programs 
and agencies for birth mothers 
and families wishing to adopt 
nowadays. There are counseling

services for birth mothers, along 
with fitness centers and hospital 
aid for the birth. There are 
financial programs to help pay 
for incurred bills . 

For adoptive families, there is 
counseling, information sessions, 
contracts and visits to the agency. 
However, neither the birth 
mother nor the adoptive family is 
typically allowed to see the other 
in person. 

All these services call into 
question the rights of the child 
around whom all of this is done. 
In most cases, there are no 
rights. After all , what child 
would be guarameed certain 
rights to detailed family informa-
tion under normal circum-
stances?

[n my experience , the only 
information truly nece5sary for 
adoptees, up to a point, is the 
family medical history. But then, 
around the age of 10, a child can 
be given the homework assign-
ment of tracing the family tree. I 
remember telling my teacher 
that r couldn't do the assignment 
because I was adopted and did 
not know my past. Having to face 
the teasing of the other kids at 
school because I did not look 
anything like my parents - I am 
the only blonde in a family of 
brown hair - was difficult 
enough. 

I know that the ways of deal-
ing with adoption are different 
for everyone. My brother is also 
adopted, and he couldn't care 
less about finding his birth par-
ents. I, however, want to know. It 
is a deep mental and psychologi-
cal issue, not one that can be 
eased simply by knowing that 
the aunt of my birth mother had 
asthma when she was a child. 

I still wonder where I would 
be had it not bee n for the 
Gladney registry. Putting my 
name on tha t list filled so much 
of the empty feeling in my chest. 
I am grateful to the' center for 
providing adopted people with a 
vital step in dealing with the dif-
ficulties that come with not 
knowing one's biological parents. 

However, this is but one 
adoption agency. There are mil -
lions of children who need some 
extra help coping with feelings of 
abandonment, which are quite 
natural, and other emotions . 

All agencies should follow 
Gladney'S example and provide a 
registry for those who have been 
adopted and wish to know more.

UCSO community 

ers praise Proposition G because it 
would make Mission Beach and 
Pacific Beach a place where they 
cou ld take their families once 
again. 

This statement is interesting 
because of the attitude it reveals. 
Puritanism is an ugly thing, but it is 
still around. However, society 
evolved along a very different, 
more secular direction, and every 
now and then, certain puritanical 
attitudes clash with the realities of 
life. 

In this case, the atrirude at odds 
is that of the supporters of 
Proposition G . Instead of dealing 
with the changes on a cultural level 
and asking whether puritanism has 
run its course, there is the tempta-
tion to outlaw the offending social 
mores. This is a curious attirude for 
a country that preaches that any-
body's freedom should be absolute

Tuition break should go to u.s. citizens Wine: 
Enjoying alcohol is a 
time-honored tradition

Giving DC fee discounts to illegal immigrants }s unfair to taxpayers 
By RYAN DARBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Isn't it funny how any given 
child seems to have more common 
,en;e than your average liberal? 
On ~ of the most basic concepts a 
child learns - and will happily 
reg Irgitate - is that people who 
bre Ik a law should be punished . If 
you were to eKplain that society 
re\\ ard. people who break the law, 
.1 child would think either that 
adults arc nuts, or JUSt plain stupid. 

If we reward illegal immigrants 
who, by definition, are breaking 
the law by just being in this coun-
try, then I suppose we are those 
things. 

Such people are in the United 
States illeg-ally; they are commit-
ting a crime by simply being here . 
Why on Eartll are we rewarding 
them for breaking the law? They 
arc certainly not entitled to the 
substantial UC fee break that they 
will soon receive. 

California residents at UC 
schools will save $3,69 1 in the 
course of a quarter - not because 
California citizenship is a mark of 
nobility, but because they and 
their parents have contributed to 
the federal and state income taxes 
that make such a discount possible. 
Illegal im,nigrants do not pay such 
taxes, and therefore don't deserve 
to rcap any related benefits. 

Based solely upon this year's 
statistics, upward of 400 snldents 
would benefit from the University 
of California's new tuition policy, 
saving each undocumented stu-
dent approximately $11,000 over 

the course of the school year. This 
means that the state will lose $4.4 
million, despite a widening deficit, 
juSt so illegal immigrants get a free 
ride. 

Once the new nlition policy 
takes effect, more undocumented 
immigrants may be encouraged 
apply for admission, costing tax-
payers far more money. Think 
about how much money $4.4 mil-
lion is - especially in light of the 
fact that UCSD just can't seem to 
find eno ugh money to provide sru-
dents with ade-

sponsored encouragement of ille-
gal immigration. Undocumented 
immigrants reside in the United 

tates and use public services free 
of charge: We educate their chil -
dren from kindergarten through 
12th grade in our overcrowded 
public schoo ls. Publi c services 
exist through the taxes that we pay, 
which they do not. 

Why, some naive liberals ask, 
don't we JUSt tear down our borders 
and let everybody come here 
freely? I think that Sept. 11 pro-

have a glass of my fine ruby nectar. 
Raising one's glass is a sign of 

cohesion and camaraderie as old as 
history, and as \videspread as sex. Do 
it in Rome, Paris or Buenos Aires, 
and all the people around you will

fortune. Do it on Mission Beach or 
Paci fic Beach, and if the supporters 
of Proposition G have their way, 
somebody will ca ll the police and

Moreover, the

role that the inter-
national border 
plays in national 
security, since 
there are people 
who come to this 
country with the 
most malicious of 
intentions. We 
need to know 
exactly who is 
walking into the 
United States 
because lax proto-
col was parrially 

innately flawed argument, espe-
cia lly because it usually stems from 
self-professed socialists . Such 
labor could certai nly be provided 
by unemployed U.S, cit izens, 
especially perennial welfare 
dependents. If Americans were to 
do the work currently done mostly 
by illegal imm igrants, they might 
demand higher wages and thus 
redi stribute some of our nation 's 
wealth for spending in the Uni ted 
States rather than in Mexico -
which is where much of the "cheap 
earnings" wind up. Be a good 
socia list and do what's good for 
our nation's working class and the 
economy as a whole: Reserve 
American jobs for Americans. 

I have a lot of respect for those 
who come here illegally. Once 
they arrive, the first thing they 
look for is a job. 

Some people in this country 
legally can trace their own 
American lineage back for cen-
turies, yet don't have the least bit 
of drive to find a job and thus will 
never succeed. 

I have nothing against undocu-
mented workers, personally; I 
would do the same thing if I were 
in their position. These are hard -
wo rking people whose descen -
dants can someday prosper in this 
country, just as the descendants of 
the first. European settl ers in 
North America did in the 17th 
century. 

If this is the best that our civiliza-
tion can come up ,vith, then hand me 
a buffalo skin and a spear and show 
me the nearest cave. It is probably 
time to start all ov; r again.

These people work hard just like 
everybody else to pay their tuition, 
so I fail to see how it can be fair to

v,'hat concerns me most about

"I wouldn't necessarily ca ll it an 
investigation because I don't have 
any specific information that's com-
ing din:ctly (i'om the individuals 
that have been impacted," she said. 

Although the rally was called 
off, a few students sti ll left class to 
see what was going on. For the 
most part, lectures remained full . 

Marshall fresh men Mark T.'lte 
and Kclscv Wiedenhoefer were two 
of the fe~ who Ilfft class for the 
information session, which consist-
ed of two beach chairs and a box of

"I'm glad there are people look-

"I'm very glad it got resolved." 

Tate and Wiedenhoefer's teach -
ing assistan t assured them that they 
would not have points deducted 
from D .O.C., which has mandatory 
lecture attendance, if they bring 
back a flier from the rally, 
Wiedenhoefer said. 

UCSD student Julia Leach 
showed her support for solving the 
problem, which she knows all too 
well . 

"I've seen firsthand how RSOs 
and administration can be unfair 
and inc'onsistent," she said . "l don 't 
know how much this will change, 
but any change will be minimaL" 

She described the relationship 
between the RAs and residents as 
adversarial and said an "us-versus-
them" atmosphere exists in the res-
idence halls. 

UCS D student Alexis Boerger 
stopped by to get an update on the 
progress. She said she supports 
UCSD Cause because the residence 
halls are no longer a "healthy living 
environment. " 

Organizers said they are pleased 
with the progress that has been 
made. 

Alex Chou, a sui temate of 
Leibowitz, said they succeeded 
because tile goal was not to disrupt 
the school but raise awareness to 
thei r cause. 

"ft shows how much the admin -
istration is willing to work," Chou 
said. "Vie expected it would be 

niuch harder." 
They cred it their \Veb site,

with getting the attention of the 
Marshall administration. 

T he Web site registered over 
( ,300 hits according to Monte 
Swank, the site's designer. 

"I t gave us a little bit of lever-
age," Leibowitz said . "Enough to 
where the dean's offke was willing 
to compromise." 

Houston -H.ands downplayed 
the significance of the Web site, 
saying it just made her want to find 
out more about the situation. 

"Had the same student come in 
to talk to me without that Web site, 
his co ncerns and questions would 
be just as valid," she said. 

T he UCSD Cause Web site and 
fliers consist of quotes from D .O.C. 
readings. They sought to legitimize 
some of their complaints by refer-
ring to legal statu tes such as equal 
protection, a civil right which is 
learned winter quarter in the justice 
segment of the D .O .C series. 

"We have llsed a lot of constitu-
tional arguments; some of it comes 
from D .O .C., but not all of it," 
Leibowitz said. 

Other references are to 
California law and the student 
handbook. 

D .O .C. professors did not playa 
role in helping with the movement, 
Leibowitz sai d. 

Paul Frymer of the sociology 
department lectures a D.O .C. jus-
tice class this quarter. 

"Generally, we talk about equal 
protection, we talk about civil 
rights," Frymer said. "I point out in 
my class that equal protection is a 
pretty narrow construct that 
applies to specific situations . It 
wouldn't apply in this situation." 

Marshall Provost Michael 
Schudson has taught the justice 
D.O.C. course in the past. He also 
disagrees with the application of 
the equal protection clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment to punish-
ment for violators of the campus' 
alcohol policy. 

"There is just no connection 
here; it's a very giant leap," he said. 

Leibowitz conceded , saying, 
"Equal protection, that is a D .O.C. 
issue ... but know it doesn't apply 
100 percent to what we are doing." 

Frymer doesn't see D .O .C. as 
causing the movement. 

"I don 't think the class is per se

ting excited about what they learn ." 
Frymer and Schudson did, how-

ever, say they are encouraged that 
the students seem to be taking 
something away from the class and 
applying it to their lives. 

"If it was the students' effort to 
rea lly take seriously the concepts 
and ideals discussed in D .O.C., 
then wonderful: That's what should 
be happening," Schudson said . "I 
just don't think it should be done in 
a vacuum without talking to the 
relevant people." 

Schudson said he was somewhat 
displeased with the situation, and 
that he felt it was sensationalized by 
the Web site prior to the students 
coming to the administration with 
their complaints. 

Schudson stressed that the 
Marshall administration is open to 
srudents and willing to meet with 
them to do discuss all salient 
issues. 

Houston-Hands agreed that the 
best way to resolve di fferences is to 
communicate with students . 

"Students should find ways to 
voice their opinions and address 
their concerns, but I'm a big advo-
cate for sitti ng down and ta lking 
about issues," she said. 

The meeting between Houston -
Hands and Leibowitz was enough 
to resolve the sin13tion for the time 
being and keep students in class. 

Although UCSD Cause used 
some of the basic principles taught 
by D.O.C. in its arguments on the 
Web site, organizers said that it was 
just a part of their argument. 
Organizers also stressed that the 
idea to work from within the sys-
tem (or change was simply "com-
1110n sense."

ne 
'good 
cause' 

By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 
Features Editor 

So what did you do on C hristmas? 
Nathan Atteberry, 27, and Steve A1sum, 20, spent 

Dec. 25 at a chilly campsite near Shepherd, Texas: 
about 30 miles north of Houston, about 40 degrees 
Fahrenheit and fitting just about .anybody's descrip-
tion of the middle of nowhere. 

The New Jersey residents fOllnd themselves camp-
ing in the Lone Star State on day 76 of a journey orig-
inally conceived as an adventure, albeit a uti litari an 
one - A1sum, a former New York City bike messen-
ger, was planning to move to San Diego via 4,600 
miles of cross-country bike trails and highways. 

Atteberry, Alsum's brother-in-law, was on a 
one-year leave from his job as a Conti nental 
Airlines flight attendant, and 10 days before the 
October departure date, he told Alsum he'd come 
along. 

The trip then grew in significance. 
"I always wanted to do something like this, and 

after [Sept. I I] ... things just kind of changed, and I 
decided to do it," Atteberry explained. "We figured if 
we were gonna do it, we might as well do it for a good 
cause," 

That cause is the Red Cross. and the bike trip 
nlrned into a grassroots furid-raiser and awareness-
raising campaign to benefit the organization that 
Alsum said was "in the spotlight ... hclp[ing] people at 
the World Trade Center. 

"We figured they needed money," Alsum said. 
Atteberry devised the name for the effort: Red 

aCross America, a play on the name of the organiza-
tion to benefit and on the annual Ride Across America 
e ent. His brother Dan set up a Web si te at 
http://W7JJ7JJ.,·edacrosSfJ1llJ!riclI.ol'g to publiciz.e the effort, 
and on ct. I I, they were off with little more than 
their bikes, a lent and sleeping bags. 

"We didn 't have any biker shoes or spandex and 
ugly-ass shirts and stuff," athan j ked. "Just our reg-
ular clothe ."

on Saturday in Ocean Beach.

Steve Alsum 
'and Nathan 

Atteberry rode 
from New York 
to San Diego 
to benefit the 

Red Cross 
Indeed, their riding gear was often as simple as 

long johns and tennis shoes. And as for the bikes, 
Nathan's was a 20-year-old Schwinn, and A1sum's was 
salvaged from a dumpster and pieced together from 
other discarded parts. 

Neither was nervous at the outset - "It's just a 
bunch of short bike rides put together into one long 
one," A1sum pointed out. O nce on the road, they 
were more concerned with fl at tires, rough back-
roads, unfriendly wea ther and sleep accomodations 
than contemplating the scope of their trip. But, at 
4,660 miles tota l from New York City to St. 
Augustine, Fla. to San Diego, th is was no amateur 
effo rt. 

Dan, who claimed he was "just the Web master," in 
fact assu med public relations and fund-raising duties, 
call ing newspapers and television stations in cities that 
Nathan and A1sum were slated to arrive in, and con-
tacting organizations about donating or pledging to 
the Red c.·oss. 

All in all, Dan found his job "pretty tough. 
. "When I started contacting people about [the 
fund-ra iser], they'd say, 'Oh, it's kinda get ting old 
news,' you know, as far as the Sept. II disaster 
thing," Dan said. "And [A1sum's and Nathan'S] 
th ing has always been that the Red Cross is always 
helping out, whether it's here or it's South America 
or wherever ... So for them it wasn't just all Sept. 
I I , it was everything the Red Cross has been 
doing." 

Media coverage was spotty, as well, due in part to 
the unpredictable nature of the trip. The men 
received favorable pres in Tilt New Or/m1lS Times-
PicaYlI1lt and television coverage in Tuscon, where the 
owner of a car dealership pledged to donate $100 for 
every bike rider who would accompany Alsum and 

athan on their ride to the city. That pledge alone 
netted $4,000. 

All totaled, Red aCross America raised abo\lt

Don't neglect study 
of valuable classics 
Students who dismiss 'dead languages' miss out 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Opinion Editor 

For years, as a young girl, I lis-
tened with quiet curiosity to my 
parents as they spouted etymolo-
gies and made literary references. 
They are knowledgeable in severa l 
languages, including Latin and 
C reek. Those two languages -
and Latin in particular - seemed 
to come LIp more than the others. 

Thus my interest in the classics 
was piqued, though it was clear that 
I would never be satiated by any-
thing that the Mount Diablo 
Unified School District could pro-
vide me with . So at the age of 13, I 
decided to undertake the direction 
of my own classical education with 
the assistance of a dusty Greek text 
and a copy of Isaac ewton's 
"Principia ." (I was ostensibly a little 
zealous.) . 

When I got a bit older - I'm 
still JUSt a girl - I was finally able 
to realize the potential of my inter-
est in Graeco-Roman antiquity. I 
am of the opinion that a k.nowledge 
of the classics is not o nly an invalu-
able enrichment of the soul and 
senses, but a practical investment as 
well. 

A grounding in Greek. and 
Larin thought used to be as inti -
mately tied to the idea of educa-
tion as general education require-
ments are now. Society'S pursuit of 
pleasure through monetary means 
has no doubt preci pitated the 
decline in classical studies enroll-
ment - how many of you would 
meet with beaming parents if you 
dropped that computer engineer-
ing major for a Latin major? -
but ir has not spelled rhe death of 
the discipline or irs influence . 
Classical rhought and feeling is so 
bound up in Western civi lization 
and culture that it wi ll never be 
eradicated. I only wish that more 
people would take the time to 
explore its connection to the here 
and now. . 

As a humanist, I have a great 
concern for the neglect of the clas-
sics in seco ndary school and college 
curriculums. Traditional, vocation-
al education is fading from the 
scene, but it is ironically bei ng 
replaced by a new kind of vocation-

al education: the kind that drops 
people into a four-year-Iong chute 
and spits them out as engineers, 
businesspeople and doctors-in-
training. 

My concern stems from my 
belief that professional education, 
though it teaches skills for a mod-
ern world, does not teach people 
how to '''ink in a modern world. 
The classics taught me that a 
grounding in Greek and Latin 
thought is a grounding in modes of 
cogitation, as well as a context for a 
fuller appreciation of t11C beauty of 
human expression. 

It is hardly worthwhi le to 
refute the argument of those who 

The Latin poet Ovid 
describes a sultry 

afternoon lounging 
with his voluptuous 

lover, and the 
tantalizing effect of her 

gauzy (and easily 
removable) garments ... 

Classical authors are 
just as interesting and 
relevant to a modern 

readership as they 
would have been to 

their contemporaries. 

believe that the classics have no 
relevance to the present day. My 
least favori te argument is 
undoubtedly that of the "dead lan-
guage": t1ut nobody speaks classi-
cal languages, and so they are not 
utilitarian enough to be slapped 
on a resume to impress a potential 
emp'oyer. Incidentally, the people 
who think this way also tend to 
believe that the term "pleasure 
reading" is self-con tradictory. 

N othing could be more rele-
vant to an understa nding of o ur 
own language th an Greek and 
Lati n (and, just looking at the ver-
itable cacographic collection of 
poorly spelled signs and advertise-
ments, God knows we need more 
people up on E nglish nuances). 

Thousands of English words in 
common use come directly from 
classical languages, or made a 
detour through Norman French 
on their way here. Other words, 
such as "abstemious," 
"periphrastic" and "stultified" are 
easily illuminated for the person 
who has studied Greek and Latin . 
For those who find such words 
archaic (there'S a good Greek 
word) or too obscure, I've got two 
friends named Merriam and 
Webster to whom I'd love to 
introduce you. 

When I began reading classical 
works in translation, I was astound-
ed at the depth of human concern 
and interest they contained. It was 
strangely fulfilling to discover that 
there is indeed little that has not 
already been experienced by thou-
sands of people living thousands of 
years before us. 

In the classical writers, we are 
lucky to have found a plethora of 
grea t minds who were able to 
commit so much ofhul1lan experi -
ence to description - the beauti -
ful, the raunchy and the tragic 
alike. The women of Athenian 
playwright Aristophanes ' comedy 
"Lysistrata" conspire to stop 
putting out until their husbands 
and lovers agree to return from 
war. The Latin poet Ovid 
describes a su ltry afternoon 
lounging wi th his voluptuous 
lover, and the tantalizing effect of 
her gauzy (and easily removable) 
garments. The Roman philoso-
pher Seneca 's letters to Luciliu 
offer practical advice on concerns 
such as whom to trust in friend -
ship and how to party like the best 
of them without sacrificing moral 
dignity. Classical authors are just 
as interesting and relevant to a 
modern readership as they would 
have been to their contempo-
ranes. 

To speak of the enjoyment and 
relevance of classical literature and 
languages is to say nothing of the 
ways in which they actually affect 
the though t process. Lati n, with its 
austere, perfect precision, and 
G reek, with its fl u id, muscular 
strength, sha rpen the mind in ways

A1 sum also appreciated the dis-

Alsum said. "Like all this stuff IS

You' re just doing your thing, hav-

Although the road trip is fin-

Now AIsum will settle in San

starting medical school in August. 

Sue said she worried occasional-

oppofnmity to shamelessly plug the 
literature department's lower-divi -
sion introduction to the Graeco-
Roman world, Literatures of the 
World 19 A-B-C. It was in that 
sequence, reading a broad survey of 
classical literature in translation, that 
my appetite for classical thought was 
fi rst whetted at the university level. 
Three years on, I believe whole-
heartedly that the series was the 
most useful instructional experience 
of my collegiate career. 

[ have no qualms with the hun-
dreds who will graduate from 
UCSD and move on to high-pay-
ing, fast- paced careers in cutting-
edge fi elds. I confess an unease, 
though, when I stop to th ink that so 
many people will neve r have 
encountered the rich legacy that 
the Hellenistic and Roman worlds 
bequeathed to us. UCSD alumni 
wi ll graduate from law school not 
knowing what "stare decisis" 
means, from business school not 

'knowi ng what "ceteris paribus" is, 
from medical school not knowing 
what a caduceus is .

The ninth-ranked UCSD women's water polo team 
faced off against UC Santa Barbara las t Friday at 
Canyonview Pool with a chance to move up in the 
standings with a victory against the s,~venth-ranked 
team. 

The Tritons did just that, jumping out ahead of the 
Gauchos, then fendi ng off a fur ious UCS B rally. 
UCSD's Emma Kudritzki scored the game-winning 
goal with 32.9 seconds left to preserve the 7-6 victory. 

In the First quarter, the Tritons, helped by a 
Courtney Hemmerly goal, quickly took a 2- 1 lead over 
the visiting Gauchos and ended the First half \vi th a 3-
2 advantage. 

However, the third quarter was when VCSD dis-
tanced itself from UCSB, using goals from Kudritzki 
and Dana Tucker to dominate the Gauchos 3- 1 in the 
quarter en route to a 6-3 lead over the national ly 
ranked team. 

The fourth quarter was a reversal of the third -
UCSB aggress ively attacked the Triton goa l in the final 
quan er of the game and managed to tie the game at six 
apiece. But senior team captain K udritzki took matters 
into her own hands, and her last-minute goal sealed the 
victOry for UCSD and boosted the TritOns to 4-2 on 
the season, while the Gauchos fe ll to 8-5. Kudritzki

team 's first ho me run o f the sea-
son. 

"It was a really bad swing," 
Men ee said. "J went in the dugout 
shaking my head and we all 
laughed about it. It was great. But 
a home run is a home run, so it 
was kind of fu nny." 

T he Tritons rolled ea rly 
agai nst San Bernard ino 's Dawn 
Onishi, the Al l-CCAA pitcher of 
the week, with Mettee tripling to 
lead off the bottom of the first, 
and Aggabao driving her home 
with a single. Aggabao advanced 
to second on a wild pitch, and 
Anderson batted her in with a 
tripl e to right-center, prompting a 
pitching chan ge fro m the 
Coyotes. UCSD tacked on four 
runs in the third and two more in 
the fourth . 

" In the first ga me we needed to 
wa ke up our bats," Mettee said. 
"In the second game, we were like, 
'a ll right , we need to make adjust-
ments and score throughout the 
game.' So we did a good job [in] 
the second game of making the 
adjustments we needed to make 
afte r the first ga me." 

Christi Martinell i went 2·for-3 
at the plate and allowed two hits, 
no walks and had five stri keou ts' in 
four strong inn ings on the mOllnd 
before giving way to Keri H anley, 
who despite all owing two 
baserunners o n wi th no body out, 
closed out the ga me by reco rding 
three consecutive outs. 

The Tritons will try to extend 
their winning strea k against 
CCAA rival Ca l State Stanislaus 
on Feb. 22 and nonconference 
oppo nent Western New Mexico

doubl eheaders at Tri ton Softball 
Field. 

"As a tea m we' re happy with 
where we are," Mettee said . "The 
best part is that we're not at our 
potential, where we can be in a 
month from now. We're just look-
ing for improvement each game

we can play."

had some great come-from-behind

The impressive come- from -
behind, truee-set victories were 
claimed by Chopra with 1-6, 7-6, 
6-3, and Wilson wi th 7-6, 3-6, 6-
3. Both players had tough oppo-
nents, but they pulled thro ugh and 
gathered wi ns for the team. 

At the No. 5 position , Blake 
Wi lso n-Hayden struggled in the 
First set, but came out wi th a com-
mand ing 7-5, 6- 1 victory over

Novak, the No.6 singles play-
er, also triumphed without much 
troubl e in his 6-4, 6- 1 win. 

Coach Eric Steidl mayer 
stressed tha t hi s team pl ayed hard , 
but th at there is room for 
improvement. 

"We defin itely play hard, and 
for that I am happy." H e said. "I 
th ink th3t there is a great deal of 
Fight in our guys. However, I also 
think that we ca n prepare our elves 
a bit better by having morc con-

will do that." .

Tritons split four, game series with Toros 
Baseball sweeps Dominguez Hills at home, loses doubleheader 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball tea m 
conti nued its quest to prove itself 
in the California Collegiate 
Ath letic Assoc iation, winning 
two games aga inst California 
State University Dominguez 
Hi lls las t week, bringing its 
record to 8-7 -1 overall . 

On Thursday, the Tritons took 
on the Taros in the First of a four· 
game set and dispatched 
Dominguez Hi ll s 9·2 with the 
strong pitching of ace John Beaven 
and the big bat of senior third 
baseman Ryan L arson. 

Larson hit a solo shot in the 
second inning to break the score-
less tie, then added a two-run 

ho me run in th e very next inning, 
in which the Tritons erupted fo r 
six runs to take a 7-0 lead. T hat 
would be more than enough -
Beaven went seven and one-third 
o f an inning to pick up the victory, 
g iving up five hits and striking out 
fi ve Toro hi tters to hand 
Dominguez Hills the loss in its 
CCAA season opener. 

The two teams met again the 
next day, pl ayi ng their second 
game on the Tri tons' home field 
before traveling to Carson, Calif. 
o n Saturday for a doubleheader to 
close out the four-game series. . 

UCSD again jumped on the

. "I thought we played hard," he 
said. "Since we're not a big team, 
the margin for erro r is a lot small-
er and everyone has to play well. 
Not everyone played well tonight." 

T he large Spirit Night crowd 
of 1,79 1 brough t energy to 
RIMAe and brought life to both 
teams. 

"The big crowd brings the 

em o ti on out," said Poole of 
Do minguez Hills. "They make 
you play harder and pick up your 
gam e." 

UCSD point guard Cameron 
Jackson, who scored 20 points 
and added eight assists on the 
night, agreed. 

"It goes to a whole other level," 
he said. "It would be incredible if 
we could get half of the crowd we 
had tonight at every game." 

In front of a far smaller crowd 
Saturday ni ght, the Golden 
Eagles of Cal State Los Angeles 
faced off against the Tritons, but 
the result was eerily similar to the 
previous night. The lead changed 
hands several times early in the 

irUling featured a three-nm double 
by Chad Addison as part of the six-
hit Tri ton attack that saw every 
UCS D ba tter come to the plate. 

Keith Smith went six innings to 
earn his second win of the season, 
and Jeff Riddle, Matt Smith, Keith 
Hernandez and Philip Betsch each 
contribu ted twO hits for the 
Tritons, who improved to 4-2 in 
the CCAA wi th the victory. 

However, on Satu rday the 
Tritons found the Toros to be less 
gracious hosts than guests, as 
Dominguez Hills swept UCSD 
11-4 and 11 -0. 

Triton left-fielder John 
Bologna sta rted off the game wid1 
a home run, yet that would be the 
only lead the Triton would have

Down by two, the Tritons

After a no-look pass by

leading scorer Ronald J o hnson 
scored 16 of his game-high 24 
points in the second half as Cal 
State Los Angeles. came out of 
the half and quickly built its lead 
from four to 10. 

"We played 35 minutes of 
defense tonight," said Jody 
Woods, who led the Tritons wi th 
20 points. "This is a 40-minute 
game and that five minute lapse 
really cost us." 

On the strength of thei r five-

UCSD starting pitcher

In the second game, the Toro

with three pitchers combining to

shutout. 

Edgar Esqueda finished the 
game a perfect 4-for-4 for the 
Toros, while Riddle came up with

"Making free throws was the 

key," said Bromley, who Fini shed

top of our conditioning and 
tonight we were in better physi-
cal and mental shape." 

Katie McGarm made a layup 
in the Final minute to cap the 76-
68 victory. 

"This was;) good win for LIS" 
Malone sa id. "They really took it 
to us at their place." 

UCSD's weekend sweep was 
its first of the season in confer-
ence play and moved them into a 
tie fo r fifth place in the CCAA 
with Cal State Los Angeles . 

Next up is a trip to Cal State 
San Bernardino on Friday, followed 
by a visit to defending CCAA and 
Division n national champion Cal 
Poly Pomona on aturday. 

Toros held the Tritons at bay and 
won 82-72. . 

"One of the things we need to 
do is make shots," said Lanthier 
afterward, citing the key to his 
team playing wel l. "Making shots 
crea tes energy because whe n 
you're missing it 's hard to get 
back and play defense." 

Looking to salvage what has 
so fa r been a disappointi ng sea-
son, the Tritons will travel to Cal 
State San Bernardino on Feb. 22, 
and then play their final road 
game against Cal Poly Pomona

scored fro m third on a squeeze

to fi nd any sort of offensive

Women's basketball overcomes 
Toros, beats Cal State Los Angeles 
By OWEN MAIN 
Contributing Writer 

It was an exci ting weekepd for 
the UCS D women 's basketball 
team, to say the least. 

On Friday night, the Tritons 
overcame a poor shooting perfor-
mance in the first half to beat 
Californi a Sta te University 
Dominguez Hills 52-48 in front of 
the Spirit Night crowd. 

Shooti ng 4-for-20 from the 
field in the first half, the Tritons 
found themselves fortunate to be 
down by only three points, 23-20, 
by the end of the half. 

"T hey played us just the way I 
would have pl ayed us," said 
UCSD head coach Judy Malone. 
"They took us out of everything 
we wanted to do." 

The Toros' relentless defense 
kept the Tritons away from the 
basket and denied them the pass-
ing lanes. 

"At halftime, we went in and 
invented some offenses with more 
dribble penetration," Malone said . 

These new offenses were effec-
tive. Forward Danyiel Wortham 
led the balanced Triton offensive 
attack with 12 points and eight 
rebounds. Freshman center 
Margaret Johnson was the top 
Triton rebounder with II, to go 

along with her nine points. Stacy 
Gallagher-Bolton also chipped in 
with seven rebounds oil the bench 
in only 16 minutes. 

"Stacy rea lly cl eaned the 
boards underneath tonight," 
Malone said. 

UCSD improved its shooting 
to 40 percent in the second half. 

"The crowd got us pumped, " 
said senior pei nt guard M aya Fok. 
"Don't get me wrong, I love the 
crowd, but we may have rushed 
our shots a littl e." 

T he lead changed hands 
numerous ti mes in the second half 
unti l UCS D guard Ali Ginn drove 
to the basket with just over three 
minutes left to put the Tritons up 
for good. Ginn ended the game 
with nine points and nine 
rebounds. 

Saturday night, the Tritons had 
revenge on their minds. Coming 
off a 13-point loss to the Eagles on 
J an. 4, UCSD looked to return the 
favor. 

Both teams came out hot, 
shooting over 50 percent, and 
when the halftime horn rang the 
game was tied at 37.

Men's tennis goes undefeated in tourney 
Tritons beat CSU Los Angeles 9-0, triumph against Azusa Pacific 
By STEPHANIE MORIARTY

The UCSD men's tennis team 
secured two wins this weekend at 
the Cal Poly Pomona tournament 
before the weather conditions 
brought play to a halt on Sunday. 

The team's first opponent, 
California State University Los 
Angeles, proved to be no match at 
all with the Tritons winning all 
nine matches. 

The Tritons started off tri-
umphantly in the doubles series 
with the No. 1 team of Sameer 

Chopra and Brian Swatt dominat-
ing their opponents in an 8-0 vic-
tory. 

Jeff Wilson and Everett 
Schroeter al so had a commanding 
8-2 win, with both players com-
peting well as a team. . 

The Mike Meyer-Dan 
Albrecht combination had the 
closest doubles match, but still 
came out on top with an 8-5 vic-
tory. 

The top five singles players 
breezed through their matches, 
with the only close match being 
E mil Novak 's three-set match, 

which he won 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 . 
The Tritons' second victim, 

Azusa Pacific University, was a 
more suitable competitor and actu-
ally gave the Tritons a scare in 
some of the singles matches. 

Once again, the Tritons started 
the match off strong by sweeping 
all three doubles matches. 
Although Azusa Pacific played 
tough, the Tritons responded by 
playing well and stepping up to the 
pressure. 

Singles losses went to Meyer 
and Swatt. Meyer, playing the No. 
I spot, had a tough opponent and 

loss, fa lling 6-0, 6-1 to Benny Lin, 
who previously was ranked 240th 
in the world . 

Swatt, playing No. 3 singles, 
struggled in the first set, losing a 
tiebreaker 7-6. Simon Bieri of 
Azusa picked up the pace in the 
second set, winning 6-0 and elimi-
nating any chance for Swatt to 
come back. 

Senior Everett Schroeter com-
mented on the Tritons ' play this 
weekend.
