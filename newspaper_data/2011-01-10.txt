YUDOF REJECTS EXECUTIVES’ DEMANDS FOR HIGHER BENEFITS 
By Chris McCoy
Staff Writer

The 36 executives who threatened to sue the 
UC system for higher pension benefits are now 
facing opposition not only from the UC Office 
of the President, but also from a new bill to cap 
pensions.

UC President Mark G. Yudof rejected the 
executives’ demands in a Jan. 4 statement, saying 
that the UC system is not obligated to provide 
higher pension payments because of a proposal 
made 10 years ago. 

If the proposal was approved, there would 
be higher pension benefits if a 2007 federal tax 
waiver was applied, granting executives payments 
of $300,000 or higher. But the UC Board of Regents 
continued with the proposal because of “fiscal 
prudence in a changing economy,” the statement said.

The executives were also rebuked by California 
State Assembly Member Jerry Hill (D-San  Mateo), 
who introduced a bill on Jan. 7 to cap pensions for 
highly paid public executives under the California 
Public Employees’ Retirement System program, 
affecting more than 1.6 million public employees.  

“I’m offended that UC executives making over 
$200,000 a year should expect that they get a 
retirement from the UC system that would cost $51 
million,” Hill said. “[But I also] I find it offensive 
that any employee would put their personal greed 
above the interests of their students.”

With AB 89, all California public employees 
would receive a maximum of $245,000 in pensions 
to match the federal limit. Currently, the state 
calculates pensions by using a percentage of the 
average of an employee’s last three years of pay. An 

employee who has worked for 30 years can earn a 
maximum pension of $183,750, according to the 
San Diego Union-Tribune.

The executives asked for the pension raise in 
1999 and were granted the waiver in 2007 to lift 
the $245,000 cap for tax-exempt institutions like 
the UC system. But, due to the state budget crisis,  
the increase was not realized. 

If authorized, the desired pension payments 
would cost $5.5 million a year, in addition to 
a required $51 million to make the increases 
retroactive to 2007, when the cap was granted.

UCOP spokesperson Steve Montiel said UC 

leaders are prepared to defend their decision in 
court if the executives sue. 

“The University of California is taking the right 
approach in tough economic times,” Montiel said.

But he also sympathized with the executives.
“It is an honest disagreement with 36 highly 

valued employees who care deeply about the 
university and its mission,” Montiel said. “The 36 
have been unfairly demonized.”

Involved in the ordeal are UCSD five executives, 
including School of Medicine Dean David

NEW COMEDY FESTIVAL 
SCHEDULED FOR FEB. 5

Next month’s WTF — or Winter Triton Festival, a three-hour comedy perfor-mance — will be the �rst large-scale 
event hosted by A.S. Council since the WinterFest concert was 
scrapped three years ago. 

“I wanted to do something di�erent that students could look for-
ward to,” Vice President of Student Life Kristina Pham said. “We al-
ready have Sun God and FallFest. It was clear we needed something 
in the winter.”

�e festival is scheduled to take place Feb. 5 in Price Center West 
Ballroom, where three comedians will perform.

Due to contract negotiations, the names of the comedians can-

not be released until the end of this week. Currently, the Concerts and 
Events O�ce is waiting for the headlining act and an accompanying 
act to �nalize the agreement. �e contract for the third act has been 
completed since before winter break.

AVP Concerts and Events Brian Wong said his o�ce was very 
lucky to book the performers they wanted for the show.

Pham and Wong decided last Spring Quarter to host a comedy 
event, inspired by the positive response received from the comedy 
performers at last year’s Sun God Festival. In the past, the council or-
ganized popular events where individual comedians — such as Bobby 
Lee and Russell Peters — performed.

“Comedy was a big hit during Sun God,” Pham said. “[In past com-
edy events], it’s kind of low-key [and it was] really di�cult to get a 
large-scale concert. I feel that we have a lot of large-scale concerts and 
we need to emphasize the event side of the o�ce. And so [the new 
comedy event] would be a great aspect to the campus for winter.”

In the past, the main student life event of Winter Quarter was the 
WinterFest concert, which featured such performers as Switchfoot and 
Zion I. �e event was cancelled three years ago due to low turn-out.

“With this  event, it’s basically a start-up event, we are not relating 
it toward WinterFest at all,” Pham said.

The Chicano Mural — which has 
covered the east wall of Peterson Hall in 
Marshall College since 2009 — was taken 
down over winter break to prepare for the 
permanent mosaic version that will be 
unveiled in April 2011. 

“A lot of students that come from urban 
areas say that when they walk by the mural, 
they think of home because, in most big 
cities, you will see big murals,” literature 
professor Jorge Mariscal said. “It makes a 
somewhat hostile and sterile environment a 
little more inviting.”

Mariscal said San Diego artist Mario 
Torero planned for the mural to be complet-
ed by December 2010, but the construction 
of the tiles was time-consuming.

“The mural is the result of a two-year 
process in which students were asking for 
community-based art,” Mariscal said.

The 15-by-50 feet mural, also known as 
“The Legacy,” will be unveiled during this

GenesÊandÊSocialÊHabitsÊCanÊDetermineÊPoliticalÊIdeology
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Rebecca Horwitz
Staff Writer

Researchers have discovered 
a gene that, when combined with 
teenage social activity, predisposes 
individuals to be politically liberal.

In a study released in October 
2010, researchers from UCSD and 
Harvard University hypothesized 
that a variation in DRD4-7R — 
the dopamine receptor D4 gene 
— predisposes people to be liberal, 
but only if they were socially active 
during adolescence.

UCSD Political Science and 
Medical Genetics Professor James 
Fowler emphasized that genes and 
the environmental condition of 
having many friends in adolescence 
are both crucial to understanding 
why a person has a certain political 
affiliation.

 “It’s not just genes,” Fowler said. 
“It’s nature and nurture.”

There are a couple variants of the 
gene DRD4: repeat seven and repeat 
four. Those who have the repeat 

seven variant gene tend to seek 
new experiences. The dopamine 
system — which determines 
emotional responses and the ability 
to experience pleasure or pain— 
plays a role in how much people 
enjoy learning about others.

“They are attracted to new 
experiences for the sake of liking 
new experiences,” Fowler said. 

Novelty-seeking behavior leads 
humans to want to learn about 
different types of people and 
understand different ideas. 

These people generally had a 
higher-than-average number of 
friends and associated with greater 
variety of personalities and social 
norms rather than sticking to a 
select few who share the same ideas, 
according to Fowler.

Fowler used the genetic 
information of 2,000 teen subjects 
from the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent Health, 
matching the genes with maps of 
their social networks.

This is the first study to identify 

a specific gene that is associated 
with political ideology. Similar 
studies have only identified what 
personality traits influence political 
ideology.

“A number of researchers are 
committed to the idea that only 
environment matters; they are not 
taking account that not only do 
we receive instruction from our 
parents, we receive their genes, too. 
This will change the way political 
scientists perceive differences in 
personality,” Fowler said.

Fowler came up with the project 
idea after he attended a presentation 
on a study of identical and fraternal 
twins, where he learned political 
ideologies could be attributed to 
variation in genes. 

This sparked Fowler’s interest in 
how political ideologies are created 
through genes.

“It clicked for me that we have 
not been thinking how people are 
different,” Fowler said. “We only 
looked at where people came from 
and the environment they grew up 

in. We are not interchangeable, we 
are like snowflakes.”

Fowler’s next step in researching 
genopolitics will be to look for 
additional genes and understand 
how they may also affect political 
viewpoints. 

He hopes to find more 
complex gene structures that have 
significant relationships to political 
personalities.

Although the show is free, stu-
dents will need a wristband — which 
can be picked up at the UCSD box of-
�ce — to get in. According to Wong, 
the show will be oversold to allow for 
no-shows. Pham also said that the 
performances will be projected in the 
Lo� for those who cannot get into the 
ballroom.

�e event will cost $31,980, an 
amount funded entirely by the coun-
cil’s mandate reserves. Of this, $2,000 
goes to security and $1,500 is for the 
venue. About $3,000 is for lights, 
sounds and stage while another 

$2,000 is for box o�ce and miscella-
neous handling. �e rest of the costs 
have been allocated to talent.

“�e money is coming from 
mandate reserves [so] it is not tak-
ing money from any other program,” 
Wong said in an e-mail. “It is money 
collected from previous students that 
would continue to be unspent except 
for other one time costs like this one.”

Wong also said he took into con-
sideration student life and the free 
admission.

“It’s also my job to create events 
and promote student life on campus,” 
Wong said. “�is event costs $0 to at-

tend. Students have to pay their fees, 
they might as well enjoy what they’ve 
spent.”

Pham said the di�erent types 
of concerts were suggested, but the 
council decided on a comedy show. 

“If it turns out well then the next 
year, council will decide if we want to 
continue funding it,” Pham said. “And 
at that point, it’s when we see where to 
take the funding from.”

The aforementioned executives

Another office responded similarly.
“We will not respond because it is

Hill, a UC Berkeley graduate, 
explained why he created the bill.

“I do what I can to support the 
good work that the UC system has 
been doing,” Hill said. “Sadly, with a 
$28 billion deficit, it will be difficult to 
provide increased funding for UC or

executives.”

The content of the mural was 

designed by members of Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán in 2008.

A high resolution photograph of 
the mural was then reprinted as a vinyl 
banner for temporary display.

“Symbolically, [the mural] being 
permanent sends out the message that 
we’re here,” Marshall Freshman and 
MEChA member Angelica Perez said. 

Initially, the mural was for tempo-
rary display. But, Mariscal and Torero 
said the racially controversial events 
during February 2010 catalyzed the 
decision to make the mural permanent.

“‘The Compton Cookout’ pushed 
the whole school to the edge,” Torero 
said. “UCSD needed to do something 
in order to heal the disturbance during 
the early part of last year. If this incident 
had not happened, perhaps we would 
not have a permanent mural.”

Vice Chancellor of Resource

“Student leaders from MEChA have 
worked in concert with us to identify 
opportunities to expand the visibility 
of culturally sensitive art on the UCSD

QUICKTAKES  Huckleberry Finn Censorship

Alan Gribben’s brash attempt to sanitize history by replacing “nigger” with ‘slave’ 
undermines the novel’s historical significance. 

There is a reason why pejoratives are used in 
the novel: They reveal the racial climate of the 
time. 

One of the most important messages of the 
novel is of interracial fraternity. It would be 
unthinkable to alter The Great Gatsby because of 
how women are portrayed, or to re-write all the 
classics in the interest of political correctness. 

If all controversial books were to follow suit, 
we would find ourselves reading watered-down 
versions of the greats — Kidz Bop for classic lit-
erature.

Racial slurs aren’t acceptable, but rac-
ism won’t be eliminated through censorship. 
Educators shouldn’t pretend race is a non-issue 
by teaching the victorious aspects of history and 
ignoring the parts that make us most uncomfort-
able. 

Novels like The Adventures of Huckleberry 
Finn allow students to confront race in the 
classroom and to understand its roots. A reveal-
ing lesson in American history shouldn’t leave 
students with a positive, uplifting feeling, but 
expose the truth of our country’s past. 

— Saad Asad
Staff Writer

When Auburn University English professor Alan Gribben announced his intent to 
publish a censored version of The Adventures of 
Huckleberry Finn, replacing “nigger” with “slave” 
and “Injun” with “Indian,” controversy ensued.

Academics can cry censorship, but the new 
version will be far more accessible by introduc-
ing the work toa wider audience . Even at schools 
where the novel is allowed, parental consent is 
often required before reading due to its racial 
slurs. A less offensive version will allow more 
people to appreciate this masterpiece.

Times have drastically changed since Twain 
published Huckleberry Finn. It’s a literary master-
piece with a message of equality too often drowned 
in a sea of controversy over the word “nigger.”

If films like “The Godfather” are regularly 
censored on TV to be more accessible to a wider 
audience, applying a similar censorship to the 
classics isn’t much of a stretch. Adjusting the 
harsher elements could ease parents’ concerns 
over the novel, and allow the novel to reach more 
students. 

While the edits might sacrifice some of the 
edge that has made Twain’s novel so pervasive, 
they’re a fair compromise if a wider audience is 
exposed to the book’s cry for equality — which is 
far more timeless than the choice of language. 

— Bridgett Rangel-Rexford
Staff Writer

The term “nigger” is disgusting, cruel and long-outdated, to be sure, but it serves to 
contextualize the novel. 

What makes Twain’s writing so radical is that 
in a time when the hatred and cruelty in the 
South were still rampant, Twain had the guts to 
use satire to show how wrong it was. The use 
of the word “nigger” further reinforces Twain’s 
critique of slavery. By removing a key element of 
Twain’s satire, the book loses its critical edge. 

Set in the early 1800s and published in 1884, 
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an attack 
on racism. By humanizing Jim, a black man who 
escapes slavery, and breaking down the racist 
assumptions that propelled slavery, Twain dem-
onstrates his disgust with discrimination and 
unfair treatment toward blacks. 

In fact, Twain’s use of the term throughout the 
book — to vilify Huck’s barbaric father and white 
slave owners, who constantly use it — emboldens 
its critique. 

To remove the work from its original context 
— as its opponents are attempting to do today by 
making it 21st-century PC — is to strip the book 
of its power. There’s no place for casual use of the 
slur today, but its appearance in Twain’s novel 
illuminates the dehumanizing nature of slavery 
better than any censored version could.

Censoring Removes Satirical EffectChanges Will Reach a Wider Audience Watered-Down Novel Ignores History

I’ve met enough people who have studied abroad to know, offhand, a shortlist of the most 
common return symptoms: depres-
sion, anxiety, newfound fervor for 
social justice, scary addiction to 
British designer drugs. 

I came back from Spain three 
weeks ago with none of these. 
Which is mostly a blessing, I guess, 
but also sort of a curse, because 
as far as I can tell, my interactions 
with other humanoids right now are 
supposed to involve lots of starry-
eyed contemplation and patronizing 
explanation — because, I mean, I 
wouldn’t expect you to get it, or any-
thing, seeing as you haven’t actually 
been there. 

Mostly, though, I’ve stuck to 
single-word descriptors of the last 
four months: awesome, amazing, 
great, etc., which seem to fit the bill 
— or would, were I to invent a 20- 
(nay, 10-) second story of blissful, 
ephemeral Mediterranean romance. 
Which would hopefully also involve 
a beachside sunset and sangria — or 
maybe cava, Spanish champagne, to 
demonstrate the completeness of my 
cultural immersion. 

It’s a problem I share with a good 
friend of mine, who’s just back from 
six months in India. No one really 
wants to hear her stories, either, lest 
they include bindis, the Taj Mahal or 
photo-ops with the cast of Slumdog 
Millionaire. (Or their probable on-
screen stand-ins. Whatevs.)

Thing is, world wonder-/club-
hopping gets to be kind of exhaust-
ing. The full, awful truth inevitably 
involves a lot of boring stuff, like 
learning that no one walks outside 
with their paper Starbucks cup and 
that most of the paella they give you 
is frozen and overpriced anyway. 
Bet that one made your jaw drop in 
envy.

Everyone’s collective stomach for 
the real awe-inspiring stuff tends to 
fill pretty fast, too. And I can’t blame 
’em: spending three boozy months 
in a dorm in Paris with other UC 
students does not, actually, make 
you a connoisseur of French wine. 
It makes you insufferably annoying. 
(Also, a likely fellow lit major.) 

There’s a difficult line to walk 
between airing your smug, bourgie 
worldliness and staying tight-lipped 
on your time away. It’s easy to find 
the appeal in the latter: decreased 
douchiness, fewer treasured 
acquaintances lost. 

But some — maybe actual 
friends — will claim to want a full 
report. They will want to hear about 
the sights, the food, if his name was 
Alejandro or Fernando. 

And, in truth, it’s hard to tell 
them. The strangest thing that no 
one seems to know about going 
abroad is that afterwards, when you 
have a suitcase of train tickets and 
museum passes and clothes that 
probably smell like cigarettes, there’s 
not really any other evidence that 
you’ve been gone. 

You hear “please” and “thank 
you” and “excuse me” at the airport 
baggage claim, which all serve as a

Repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is a monumental achievement, but universities shouldn’t 
let ROTC back on campus before considering why it was banned in the first place.   

 By Allison Gauss 

THIS UNIT’S OUT OF LINE

After President Obama repealed the 17-year-old “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy last December, campuses 
that had rejected the initiative have wel-
comed back the Reserve Officer Training 
Corps. 

Despite banning the program dur-
ing the Vietnam War, universities such 
as Harvard, Columbia, Stanford and UC 
Berkeley have been inspired by the new 
change to give the programs a second or 
third chance.

Members of college ROTC programs 
can receive upwards of a full scholarship 
plus a monthly stipend, and in turn, they 
take one ROTC class a semester and do 
drills once a week. Of course, there’s  also 

the requisite early-morning physical train-
ing three times a week. 

When an ROTC candidate graduates, 
he’s commissioned as a Second Lieutenant 
in the military, and is expected to serve 
four to six years. UCSD doesn’t have an 
ROTC program; it’s a cross-town affiliate 
of neighboring schools University of San 
Diego and San Diego State. 

But UCSD aside, universities should 
not settle for reinstating ROTC when the 
myriad other reasons that kept ROTC off 
their campuses haven’t been addressed. 
Until the ROTC class at least meets the 
universities’ minimum standards, the pro-
gram should remain barred to retain these 
schools’ integrity. 

Elite universities broke away from 
ROTC decades ago because the military 
was unable to adequately prepare prospec-
tive students. According to Stanford history 
professor Barton Bernstein, the universities 
couldn’t justify giving students academic 
credit for classes that maintain “the intel-
lectual depth of a high school freshman 
course.”

University of Florida Professor of Law 
Diane H. Mazur said that, over the past few 
decades, ROTC programs have not raised 
their academic standards. This means the 
main problem that caused the program 
to be fixed has not been rejected, and so, 
instead of accepting a piecemeal offering,

weird, unusually polite reintroduc-
tion to America. 
Maybe the next day 
you eat your first 
burrito in what feels 
like three lifetimes. 

But then it’s 
all sort of normal 
again. 

You get used to 
the good service at 
restaurants and car-
rying a coffee cup 
outside. The jet lag 
fades. No one looks at you funny for 
walking and eating breakfast at the 

same time. It’s life, and whatever 
precipitated it wasn’t. 

Going back to 
school is stranger 
still. After months 
of alleged studying 
at a place where 
classes start 20 
minutes late and 
open-book final 
exams dare to ask, 
“What is the pro-
tagonist’s name?”, 
it’s difficult to 
readjust to a place 

where failure and ADHD drug reli-
ance are the norm. 

It just calls for certain adjust-
ments. Taking Spanish from a nice, 
perfectly capable grad student whose 
ancestors may well have sailed over 
on the Mayflower is a pretty obvious 
one, but there are also small, forgot-
ten pleasures to behold: the prox-
imity of the nation’s premier nude 
beach; the phrase “can you charge it 
to my student account?”. 

Two weeks’ time has been dis-
tance enough to even make me 
wonder, in moments of bleary eyed 
sleeplessness, whether it all really 
happened. I guess it did. 

(And, for what it’s worth, his 
name isn’t Alejandro.)

the universities should hold out for a 
true commitment to their academic 
standards that have brought them 
world-class prestige. They should 
either wait, or open up negotiations 
about raising the bar on course dif-
ficulty. 

While some argue that it’s col-
leges’ patriotic duty to allow ROTC on 
campus, the purpose of undergradu-
ate education is not to recruit the 
country’s military, but to help shape 
citizens with the knowledge and criti-
cal thinking skills to make their own 
decisions about government and mili-
tary actions, and their own decision 
on whether to join the military. 

So it’s a problem that when one 
peripheral problem of ROTC is fixed, 
the schools are jumping back on the 
bandwagon. 

The Boston Globe reported 
Harvard President Drew Faust as say-
ing that the issue is “entirely linked to 
‘don’t ask, don’t tell.” Faust may claim 
that there is only one reason ROTC is 
barred on campuses, but she shouldn’t 
allow ROTC back on campus until the 
original reason these programs were 
discontinued has been resolved. 

The schools that dropped their 
ROTC programs sacrificed more than 
just scholarships; the 1996 Solomon 
Amendment withheld federal funding 
from schools if they refused to host 
ROTC programs. 

But schools shouldn’t have to 
choose between funding and com-

promising their academic standards. 
Instead, schools should stand their 
ground and wait until ROTC repeals 
its threat. After all, Ivy League schools 
have such huge endowments that los-
ing out on some government money 
should be a non-issue. 

Another reason universities chose 
to keep ROTC out of their hallowed 
halls was to protest the nation’s unjust 
wars. While President Obama claims 
the end of the Iraq War is in sight, he’s 
also escalated it by sending in tens of 
thousands of additional troops, mak-
ing his promises subject to suspicion. 
Even with differing circumstances, the 
climate of two unpopular wars mirror 
those of the circumstances that led to 
the banning of ROTC, circumstances 
that shouldn’t change based on one 
non-relevant change.

UCSD is a public institution, and 
doesn’t have the Ivy League luxury 
of rejecting federal funds based on 
moral academic principles. After all, 
the entire UC system endowment 
(divided between 10 schools) is $4.9 
billion, while Harvard alone pulls in a 
whopping $27.6 billion. 

So, if ROTC academic principles 
are raised to appease universities, 
perhaps more colleges will be more 
responsive to allowing a military pres-
ence back on campus. Until then, uni-
versities that can afford to should hold 
their ground and wait out the storm.

Yours might be a sad home of leftovers and Easy Mac, but chefs across 
the country are using the microwave to take their culinary exploits to new 
heights. (Yes, really.) 

But this ubiquitous appliance wasn’t born a chef ’s favorite. According to 
Wired magazine, the microwave first came into existence in the 1940s. In 
1945, engineer Percy Spencer discovered the heating effect of microwaves. 
and in 1947 Radarange built the first microwave, which stood at a stagger-
ing six feet and weighed a hefty 750 pounds. 

After two decades of redesign, households finally began to pick up the 
new invention when the price finally dropped from $2,000-$3,000 to $500 
per unit. 

The inner workings of a microwave are even more complex than its 
expansive history. Here’s the mechanism in brief: The machine passes (you 
guessed it) microwaves over food, creating an alternating magnetic field. 
This causes the water molecules in food to realign — sort of like a magnet 
— and the movement causes the food to heat up. 

Though a staple in most households today, articles on the microwave’s 
negative effects (don’t stand too close!) flood news feeds regularly, and it 
continues to play second fiddle to bigger, flashier kitchen appliances, mak-
ing it one of the most under-appreciated household fixtures of our time. 

But some of our favorite chefs and foodies not only understand the 
merits of a microwave, but make liberal use of the device in their own 
cooking. Here’s a list of their favorites, and ours:

Artichoke lemon risotto — from Barbara Kafka, author of 
Microwave Gourmet, and James Beard award winner

In a 2008 interview with The New York Times, Barbara Kafka told 
reporter Mark Bittman that the best item to microwave was “Vegetables.

BARONA CASINO: BETTING HIGH 1932  Wildcat Canyon Road Lakeside, CA 92040(888) 722-7662
F or a fraction of the cost of a weekend Vegas trip, Barona Resort and Casino offers a 
fraction of the gluttony. Located 
40 minutes east of La Jolla in not-
so-scenic Lakeside, the casino fills 
a useful niche: on-demand, some-
what-classy entertainment. 

The moment you drive onto the 
grounds, you’re greeted by a hand-
ful of smartly dressed employees 
in suits and name tags, ready to 
pull your car around to the free 
valet lot, lest you waste a moment 
of potential gambling time in the 
five-story parking garage. 

One of the most alluring 
aspects of the place is the stag-
gering amount of free swag you’re 
offered on arrival. More greeters 
still are tasked with arming gam-
blers mid-bet with complimentary 
bowls of chocolates, matches and 
wetnaps (all emblazoned with the 
Barona logo, of course).  

At Barona, it pays to be under 
21 — drinks of the non-alcoholic 
variety are also free. And here’s the 
clutch: Most ATMs have no with-
drawal fees, so you don’t have to 
think twice before diving into your 
savings to claw out of blackjack 
debt.

Even with all the freebies, you 
don’t have to worry about your 

arms being too full to pick up the 
chips: Barona has picked up on 
chipless betting, so many of their 
minimum bet tables use electronic 
touch pads. Minimum bets for 
blackjack and certain poker games 
can run as low as five bucks, but if 
card games aren’t your style, there’s 
no shortage of slots. 

In case the casino-standard, 
stroke-inducing supply of flash-
ing lights didn’t already clue you 
in, slot machines fill every crevice 
of the torturously overwhelming 
building. Grannies, frat boys and 
the middle-aged sit side by side 
in front of the machines, engulfed 
in a perpetual cloud of cigarette 
smoke. 

With an ever-expanding array 
of penny slots, Barona caters to the 
stingy gambler who enjoys losing 
five dollars a night to a flashing 
machine.  

When you’re tired of losing 
money, head over to the surpris-
ingly affordable food court, featur-
ing the Pizza Place, Barona Coffee 
Co., Rubio’s and Feisty Kate’s 
Burgers & Malts. No one under 18 
is allowed in the casino, but dining 
areas are fair game before 8 p.m. 

Barona also features 11 formal 
restaurants (four of which serve 
alcohol) and a Vegas-style buffet, 

but skip them if you’re on a tight 
budget. The $20.99 Seasons Fresh 
Buffet doesn’t quite live up to its 
titular promise, though it’s the 
perfect place to find the equiva-
lent of three Panda Express meals. 
Head over to the hot dog cart and 
Barona Coffee Co. for their gelato 
instead. A hot dog costs 
$1.50, and a small scoop of 
gelato is 50 cents. Coffee 
drinks and hot chocolate 
from Barona Coffee Co. sell 
for a dollar.  

If you’re feeling swanky, 
most restaurants are open 
until 10 p.m. (midnight on 
weekends), but dine any 
later and you’ll be confined 
to food court fare. Barona 
also offers game-side din-
ing for the addict, reasoning 
that, “When you’re at the 
top of your game, the last 
thing you want to do is take 
a time-out.” 

And like your average 
flashy, smoke-filled casino, 
Barona knows that time is 
money. 

Barona is open 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week.

there are studies that show they retain more 
vitamins.” So, in keeping with the microwave-
pioneer’s words of wisdom, here’s her savory 
artichoke lemon risotto.

Grab six tablespoons of olive oil, one cup 
of minced onion, two cups of Arborio rice, six 
cups of vegetable broth, one can of artichoke 
hearts, the zest and juice of two lemons and 
one tablespoon of kosher salt.

Mix the onions and olive oil in a micro-
wave-safe dish and put them in the micro-
wave, uncovered, for three minutes. Add the 
broth, and cook the mixture for 12 minutes. 
Then add the artichokes, and cook for six 
minutes. Finally, add the lemon, cook the con-
coction for another two minutes, and salt as 
needed. The whole mixture serves six to eight 
people.  

Salmon with crème fraiche — from 
Beth Hensperger, author of  Not Your 
Mother’s Microwave Cookbook

California-raised Hensperger learned 
her culinary art in the Bay Area’s Palo Alto, 

eventually moving on to 
Los Angeles’ Epicurious 
and then back to San 
Francisco to start her 
own catering company.

For Hensperger’s salmon, you’ll need four 
sheets of parchment paper, two tablespoons of 
unsalted butter (room temperature), four (six- 
to eight-) ounce salmon fillets with the skin, 
eight tablespoons of crème fraiche, salt and 
freshly ground pepper, one cup of zucchini 
julienned, one cup of sliced white mushrooms 
and eight teaspoons of diced fresh dill.

Fold each piece of paper in half, and 
spread the butter below the parchment’s crease 
and then put the salmon (seasoned with salt 
and pepper) on top.  

On each filet, add two tablespoons of 
crème fraiche and two teaspoons dill. Then 
divide the greens amongst the packets (the 
zucchini and the mushrooms) and season like 
the salmon, folding over the parchment when 
you’re done.  

Place the packets in the microwave, and 
cook on high for three minutes. 

Hot Trends: Microwaves Are Useful for More Than Nuking Leftover Lunch

Chocolate pop rock lollipops — from 
Michael and Brian Voltaggio, winner and 
runner-up on “Top Chef ” season 6

Brian and Michael Voltaggio are big micro-
wave fans. On their YouTube channel, “voltag-
giobrothers,” Michael wrote an impassioned 
defense of the kitchen helper, calling it “one of 
the most underused, under-appreciated appli-
ances in any kitchen … Most people think it’s 
used for just warming things up, and occasion-
ally defrosting meat and poultry, but it can 
actually do far more than just that.” 

On that same channel, the Voltaggio broth-
ers have a host of microwave cooking how-tos 
(including one on bread), but our favorite is 
their chocolate lollies with pop rocks. 

To start, the duo gathered chocolate coins, 
neutral-flavored pop rocks, lollipop sticks and 

molds. They then took half a cup of chocolate 
and put it in the microwave for three minutes. 

Cold chocolate is then added to the melted 
chocolate to stabilize the liquid’s temperature 
and prevent the finished product from melting 
at room temperature.  

Then reheat for 15 seconds, add a couple 
more chocolate coins and mix with the pop 
rocks. 

Next, take the mold and set the lollipop 
sticks inside and spoon chocolate into each of 
the rounds. Put the gooey pops into the freezer 
to harden (5 to 10 minutes should do it) and 
then take them out of the molds and serve. 

Short, sweet and simple — just like the des-
sert itself.

R-GANG EATERY

RESTAURANTREVIEW • MINA NILCHIAN

3683 5th Avenue
San Diego, CA  92103
(619) 677-2845

I f R-Gang Eatery owner Richard Sweeney looks familiar, that’s because he is: The chef was uncer-
emoniously booted from the fifth sea-
son of Bravo’s “Top Chef” in the show’s 
third episode. 

Sweeney, whose catchphrase on 
the show was “Keep it simple, stupid!” 
opened R-Gang with the aim of adding 
international flavor to retro-American 
dishes like burgers and macaroni and 
cheese.

Sweeney hasn’t had the smoothest 
sailing — after his bumpy road to chef-
dom (he was a waiter and gym manag-
er before getting into the culinary arts), 
and an even bumpier exit from “Top 
Chef,” the New York native opened 
R-Gang in June 2010 after serving 
as an executive chef for Confidential 
Restaurant + Loft, in downtown San 
Diego. 

R-Gang Eatery, located about 20 
minutes from campus in Hillcrest, has 
a metallic exterior that doesn’t shy away 
from décor-kitsch with a massive neon 
sign. The cramped, aggressively under-
lit interior doesn’t square with the exte-
rior — the menu’s scrawled on the wall 
in hasty freehand; the old tablecloths 

evoke mom’s kitchen. The printed 
menu expounds on the exterior’s gim-
mick, with a prominent “As Seen on 
TV!” label. 

The food seems confused, too: dry, 
ground lamb Salisbury steak ($16) 
drenched in a heavy pool of cabernet 
and wild mushroom pan gravy shares 
the same “Supper” section on the 
menu as a mushy vegetable-infused 
duck potpie ($14) with an inconsistent 
crust. The heavy sauce of the former 
drenched the tender steak; it would 
have fared better with a lighter sauce. 
The potpie was equally difficult to eat, 
as the crust detached from the bot-
tom half of dish as a single unit, rather 
than breaking off with a forkful of the 
homogenous and almost gelatinous 
interior. 

On the other hand, a menu front-
runner is the duck fat tater tots ($8). 
Stuffed with sautéed mushroom, roast-
ed garlic and fontina and fried in duck 
fat, the potatoes bear little resemblance 
to their lumpy, undercooked schoolyard 
cousins. And they finally got the tex-
ture right — soft white filling contrasts 
nicely with a golden-brown and crispy 
breading, which came accompanied by 

a thick rosemary Dijon dipping sauce.
R-Gang’s extra fixings fare no bet-

ter than the entrees. The seasonal 
gingerbread vodka martini ($8) was 
an unsettling mixture of vanilla vodka, 
Frangelico, Bailey’s and ginger beer, 
which separated from the vodka a few 
minutes into the meal. The sweets 
selection follows the bacon-for-dessert 
trend of the moment: a chocolate-
covered bacon sundae with vanilla 
gelato ice cream ($6), consisted of 
undercooked, leathery bacon coated 
with chunky semi-sweet chocolate that 
curdled with the ice-cold vanilla of the 
gelato. 

Occasionally over-attentive and 
zealous, rattling off entrees and desserts 
with practiced memorization, the wait 
staff would later disappear for 20-min-
ute chunks of time. For the $20 that 
a regular sized meal would cost, the 
average penny-pinched college student 
would hope for better service. 

Sweeney’s restaurant doesn’t provide 
the comfort it professes to offer, but 
constitutes a confused, fussy and unset-
tling dining experience. While it’s a res-
taurant that’s quick to boast, we’re not 
sure what the fuss is all about.

VickÕsÊComebackÊHardÊtoÊIgnore
way they had been playing reminds 
me more of the Saints of last year 
and the Chargers when they actu-
ally show up to a game. They have 
the offense and special teams to run 
up the score at any time, combined 
with a defense that makes key stops 
and doesn’t let the opposing offense 
have the big plays. 

This wasn’t the case Sunday, 
as they fell to the Packers for the 
second time this season in a heart-
breaking (for me) loss in the first 
round of playoffs. Vick played well, 
but couldn’t come through in the 
clutch as he threw an interception 
that sealed the Packers’ win.

I thought the Packers were going 
to get rocked on Sunday. From 
there, the Eagles should have beaten 
the Bears because — come on — 
when have the Bears ever really had 
a shot at anything? So I thought 
their third playoff game was going 
to be against the Saints, who, 

although fighting for their return 
to the ultimate bowl, are lackluster 
and in poor form this year. I was 
more right than I thought as the 
Saints fell early to the Seahawks, 
who are going to lose to Atlanta. 
So, the games lined up for Philly 
looked like smooth sailing to the 
big game.

Since old man Manning is out of 
the picture, the only tough game is 
at the Super Bowl against the pretty 
boy and his Patriots, and no one 
wants them to win anyway. They’re 
like the blue-blooded, cold team 
everyone knows is probably going 
to win but also hopes doesn’t, and 
this year, they have a good chance 
of losing.

So far, I was wrong about the 
Eagles, but look for them in the 
future as Vick and his boys come 
back next year as real contenders. 
Now I have to change my pick to 
the cold-blooded Pats, even though 
I would really like Atlanta to hand 
them an upset at Super Bowl XLV.

improving,” Carlson said. “I’m still 
very encouraged by our perfor-
mance and we just have to keep 
getting better.”

The Tritons shot a season-low 
32 percent for the game and had 11 
turnovers.

“It’s one thing to be in a situa-
tion where you’re not getting good 
shots and trying to take bad ones,” 
Carlson said. “But I don’t think 
we’ve done that. I think our shot 
selection has been very good. We 
just haven’t made shots. At some 
point we’re going to make them. 
We’re much better than our field 
goal percentage has shown.”

Stanislaus led by six points with 
2:52 remaining, but the Tritons cut 

the lead to one with 48 seconds 
left in the game after a basket from 
Ryan. After struggling with free 
throws throughout the game — the 
Warriors were 12-17 from the stripe 
at that point — Stanislaus made four 
of six from the line in the final min-
ute to hang on for the win.

The Tritons fell to 8-6 overall 
with the losses, and 3-5 in con-
ference play. The squad will look 
to turn its fortunes around with 
four home games over the next 
two weeks, beginning with a game 
against Cal State Los Angeles on 
Thursday. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. 
at RIMAC Arena.

Swim Team Suffers 
Close Loss to LMU
By Tyler Nelson
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S SWIMMING — The UCSD women’s swim-
ming and diving team had not competed in the water 
for over a month, and the break proved unhelpful, as 
the Tritons fell 132-130 to rival Loyola Marymount 
University at home on Saturday, in one of the Tritons’ 
closest meets in recent years. 

Last season, the Tritons narrowly defeated the Lions 
105-99 at Loyola Marymount, but were unable to pull out 
the win this time around. Despite three first-place finishes 
from junior captain Alex Henley, the Tritons fell short in 
the final race.

Throughout the meet, the Tritons and Lions changed 
leads several times before the Tritons gained a seven-
point edge going into the 400-yard freestyle relay. The 
Lions took first in the relay while the Tritons claimed sec-
ond, but it was the LMU second team that pulled through 
and took the third-place finish and victory in the meet. 

Despite the narrow defeat, there were many good signs 
and great performances from UCSD swimmers. Henley 
won the 1000-yard freestyle (10:32.09) and reclaimed 
the Triton lead before the last race by winning the 200-
yard individual medley (2:08.94). She also set a personal 
record for herself this season, with a time of 2:05.74 in the 
200-yard backstroke.

“Alex Henley really showed her versatility once again,” 
UCSD head coach Scott McGihon  said. “Sometimes 
there’s a tendency to take her excellence for granted, but 
that was a very good performance today.”

The Tritons got the meet started well with a victory in 
the 200-yard medley relay. After the first race, the Lions 
won four of the next five, with sophomore Olivia Martens’ 
win in the 200-yard butterfly (2:10.12) the only Triton 
victory in that stretch. 

After Henley’s win in the backstroke, though, the 
Tritons took the next four races. Emily Adamcyzk won 
the 200-yard breast stroke with a time of 2:22.44, and 
freshman Anji Shakya won the 500-yard freestyle with a 
time of 5:11.79. Henley won the individual medley.

“This was a disappointing meet to lose, but it was good 
to race again after eight weeks of training,” McGihon said. 
“We don’t really focus in on any one dual meet.”

The Tritons will travel to Bakersfield next weekend to 
take on Cal State Bakersfield and Fresno State.

Tritons Come Up Short in Road Swing
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
men’s basketball team had a tough time 
on the tail end of its three-game road 
trip, losing 68-55 to Chico State on 
Friday before falling just short in a 
57-55 loss to Cal State Stanislaus on 
Saturday.

“I think both nights we had really 
good efforts and did really good things,” 
head coach Chris Carlson said. “There 
were just certain portions of the game 
where we just couldn’t execute, whether 
it was not executing what we want to do 
offensively, or we couldn’t get the one 
stop we needed at a certain time.”

On Friday, Chico’s Roderick 
Hawkins scored 18 points and pulled 
down seven rebounds to lead the 
Wildcats to their fourth straight victory 
over the Tritons. UCSD’s junior center 
Christian Hatch recorded his second 
straight double-double with 19 points 
and 10 boards, but the Wildcats caught 
fire in the last 12 minutes of the game 
to pull away from the Tritons.

UCSD tied the score at 43 with 12:53 
thanks to a bucket by Hatch, but Chico 
outscored the Tritons 25-12 for the 
remainder of the game to seal the win. 
The Wildcats shot 42 percent from the 
field on the game — including 45 per-
cent in the second half — and forced 12 
Triton turnovers. 

Hatch scored in double figures for 
the Tritons’ fifth straight game, and 
went 6-14 from the field. Senior guard 
Casey Ryan was the only other Triton 
in double figures, posting 13 points 
and nine rebounds. Sophomore starters 
Ryan Peters and Justin Brue both had 
a rough night, combining just seven 
points off of 4-16 shooting. 

UCSD had a better time against Cal 
State Stanislaus, but were still unable 
to pull out the win. Hatch had a sixth 
straight double-double with a game-
high 17 points and 12 rebounds, but 
he could not overcome a poor shooting 
night for the Tritons, and the Warriors 
held on for the win.

Michael Vick is one of the most contro-versial and divisive players in the NFL 
today. He is also, to the chagrin and surprise 
of many, picking apart defenses with surgical 
precision and putting the Philadelphia Eagles 
on his capable shoulders. 

I love Vick’s turnaround. The increase in 
his work ethic, his poise on and off the field, 
and his obvious commitment to righting his 
wrong makes him, in my opinion, the best 
quarterback in the game today.

We all know the story of the dog fighting 
and the torture. Vick was a rising NFL star 
who played well on some days and didn’t 
show up on others. He didn’t seem to have 
the smarts to be one of the best, but had 
occasional moments of greatness all the same. 
This was all overshadowed by his trial, dur-
ing which he was made the exemplar of the 
deadly, dangerous sport. 

PETA needed Vick to be the fall man to 
bring attention to the evils of dog fighting, but 
maybe PETA’s goals  attack benefitted Vick 
more than anyone could ever have guessed.

I thought his career would be over. Two 
years in prison plus huge debts to numerous 
creditors is not the formula for a successful 
comeback. Add horrible public opinion of the 
guy, and virtually no team or general manager 
would want to take a chance on him. 

Even when he was given a chance, I 
assumed it was going to be ugly. I thought 
Vick would split time, playing on a schedule 
like Vince Young’s — on a few plays, off a few 
plays, leading to obscurity as a quarterback 
with the athleticism to wow in college, but 
lacking the key skills needed to make his mark 
on the NFL. 

But when this season rolled around, Vick 
wasn’t just playing football; he was dominat-
ing football. 

With a stumble against the cheeseheads 
in Week 1, early victories came against 
Jacksonville and Detroit. It appeared the 
explosive offense and special teams of the 
Eagles were going to make me look stupid. 

And really, they have. 
Even with some lackluster performances 

and kinks that had to be worked out through 
the season, the team came back strong and 
kicked the living daylights out of any team it 
chose. The Eagles had their downturns, but 
so does every team in the NFL. Injuries and 
off-days happen, and overall, the Eagles dem-
onstrated their ability to go out and make the 
big plays when it counted.

DeSean Jackson running a 90-plus yarder 
for a touchdown on a broken ankle is one 
such example. The best was probably when 
the team scored 28 points in the waning eight 
minutes to beat a solid Giants team. 

Vick was the heart of these games, and 
— rather than trying to force passes, leading 
to incompletions and picks — he brilliantly 
worked inside the offense, running, passing 
and handing off. He became the real deal. 
Rather than being all talk and swagger and 
playing when he feels like it, Vick now plays 
every down like he’s playing for his job, play-
ing to win and playing his best at all times.

Before his imprisonment, Vick was out-
spoken and rash both on the field and off, 
leading me to believe he was unintelligent. 
Now, he doesn’t talk as much trash, and seems 
to respect his team and what they’re doing. 
(Either that, or he’s learned to keep his mouth 
shut, which is wisdom in and of itself.) 

Yesterday, the Eagles played the Green Bay 
Packers. I’ve read several columns portray-
ing Rodgers as a better quarterback, and the 
defense of the Eagles as floundering, but the

CARLISLE, FEDER LEAD 
TRITONS TO AWAY WINS
The UCSD women’s basketball team picked up its third and fourth straight wins with key victories on the road against nation-
ally-ranked Chico State on Friday and Cal State 
Stanislaus on Saturday.  

The Tritons came up big on Friday with a 
thorough 73-53 victory over conference power-
house No. 20 Chico State, snapping the Wildcats’ 
14-game home winning streak and handing 
them their first conference defeat.

All-American Chelsea Carlisle rose to the 
occasion in usual fashion. The junior guard led 
the Tritons’ scoring, recording 26 points, seven 
rebounds and three assists. 

Junior guard Daisy Feder further cemented 
her reputation as the Tritons’ sharpshooter, 
coming off the bench to sink four of her nine 
three-point attempts and ending the night with 
17 points.

The Wildcats got off to a quick start, hitting 
three of their first five shots to take the early 
lead. 

But back-to-back three-pointers from Feder 
in the ninth minute of the game put UCSD on 
top, securing a lead  bolstered by the Tritons’ 
hot shooting.

The Tritons would finish the night shooting a 
stellar 47 percent from the field.  Conversely, the 
absence of Chico’s top scorer Natasha Smith — 
who averages 14.6 points per game — hurt the 
Wildcats offensively. 

They would go on to miss 33 out of their next 
45 attempts, and finish the game shooting a mere 
35 percent from the field.

In the final game of their road trip, the 
Tritons took on Cal State Stanislaus, where they 
came away with a narrow 86-80 victory to end 
the Warriors’ five-game winning streak. 

The Tritons came out hot in the first half, 
shooting 68 percent from the field.  

UCSD overtook the lead in the fifth minute 
after Carlisle put in a three-pointer, which was 
followed by a flurry of field goals from junior 
and sophomore starters Lauren Freidenberg and 
Emily Osga. 

The Tritons continued to pour on the offense 
with major contributions from the bench — who 
collectively outshot the Warriors’ reserves 20-5 
— with Feder putting in nine points for the night 
and freshmen forwards Erin Dautremont and 
Magdalena Usher both posting six points.

The Tritons went into the second half with 

a commanding 16-point lead. But Stanislaus 
guards Andreanna Marshall and Christin Gowan 
caught fire, as the Tritons watched their lead 
whittle down to a single point with eight minutes 
remaining. 

But two three-pointers from Feder put the 
Triton lead back to seven, and UCSD held 
on for the win.

Marshall finished with a team-leading 
26 points for Stanislaus, while Gowan 
finished with 16 points, combining to 
score over half of the Warriors’ overall 
buckets.

Despite outscoring the Tritons 
26-10 and going 61 percent 
from the field in the sec-
ond half, the Warriors were 
unable to contain Carlisle, 
who became the Tritons’ 
leading scorer for the sixth 
straight game. Carlisle posted 
31 points, while also leading the 
team in rebounds and assists.  

“I’m so proud of this team right 
now; we had a tough three-game week on 
the road and we went 3-0,” head coach 
Charity Elliott said. “Chelsea Carlisle 
had a phenomenal weekend, but we also 
had so many other people step up when 
we needed them. Emily Feder, Megan 
Perry, Lauren Freidenberg and Erin 
Dautremont each had outstanding 
contributions this week.” 

After a rough start to the sea-
son, the Tritons’ fourth straight 
win seemed to get the team in gear.

“I definitely believe that we 
have developed some chemistry 
and confidence these last few 
weeks,” Elliott said in an e-mail. 
“And we are so glad to be back 
home for a few weeks!”

With the pair of wins, UCSD 
improves to 6-2 in the CCAA, put-
ting the Tritons in fifth.

The Tritons will return to RIMAC 
Arena this week, where they will 
take on Cal State Los Angeles on 
Thursday, Jan. 13.
