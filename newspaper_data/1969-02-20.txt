Regents' M eeting 

fJrospects Appear Good For 
.fhird_ College Approval : 
Members of the UC Board of 

Regents Educational Policy Com-
mittee yesterday forwarded the 
Third College Academic Plan to 
the full Board for approval 
which is expected today. 

The controversial admissions 
plan was excluded from today's 
deliberations at the UC Exten-
sion Center in downtown San 
Francisco. Further study and an-
alysis was given as the reason 
for the delay. 

UCSD Chancellor William J . 
McGill and Third College Acting 
Provost William Frazer present-
ed the plan to the Educational 
Policy Committee Thursday af-
ternoon. Although only 10 re-
gents visited the campus to dis-
cuss the plan, many members' 
response to the academic plan 
was highly favorable. 

respectable". Though he report-
edly did not seek to separate the 
academic plan from the admis-
sions plan, he said yesterday 
" their separation will work to 
UCSD's advantage. UCSD can now 
establish the college, make it aca-
demically respectable and deve-
lop an admissions plan in the next 
two years . 

The Chancellor said he would 
use the special admissions waiver 
entitled to UCSD to admit disad-
vantaged students while a perma-
nent admissions plan was worked 
out. 

McGill noted the admissions 
plan as proposed would, in effect, 
ghettoize Third College. He said 
he would rather get minorities 
into any of UCSD's colleges ra-
ther than channel them into any 
one in particular. 

atson Likely to Leave 
as Health -Center Head 

said Regent John Canaday, "I 
am tremendously impressed with 
the plan because it recognizes 

. the great social problems of our 
time and intends to deal with 
them." 

Regent Campbell also approved 
of the plan, but precautioned that 
it "was an experiment" and ask-
ed that it must "be watched care-
fully." He recommended that the 
Board get periodic reports of its 
progress. 

Along these lines Regent or-
ton Simon suggested the univer-
sity increase to 4Q special ad .. 
mittance allowances so that a U-
niversity - wide open admissions 
policy could be achieved without 
any major change in University 
policy that is threatened by the 
Third College Admissions Plan. 

by BIth Lyons 
Vice-Chancellor and Dean of 

Student Affairs George Murphy 
announced this week that a secret 
committe including both students 
and faculty is confident that it 
has found a qualified 
replacement for the current 
Director of Health Ser-
vices - who has not yet officially 
resigned. Dr. Robert W. Watson's 
resignation as director has 
neither been officially announced 
nor accepted, although the 
machinery for his removal has 
been working since last July. 

According to Dr. Watson, his 
job has been in jeopardy since 
three years a~o, when he was told 
tc" start looking for another job" 
as a result of his active and ad-
visory participation in the for-
mation of conservative political 
groups on campus. In his words, 
"That's what you get for siding 
with the minority." 

Dr. Watson is vocal in his belief 
that the campus is one-sided 
politically and that conservatives 

DR. WATOON 

on campus are discriminated 
against because of their political 
affiliations. His allegation that a 
small nucleus of administrators 
and professors control political 
hiring and firing on the campus 
was calmly denied t. V Murphy, 
who feels tha~ the polittcal views 
of his staff are tl eir own 
business. There has 1 t' some 
time been friction beh ~en the 
two administrators, though 
both maintain that they are able 
to carryon with business with 
"on the surface" amity. 

"I was asked to resign - it 
wasn't my own idea," said Dr. 
Watson, "but there were no 
concrete reason~_ given." Ap-

parently, on the management 
level - which includes Mur-
phy - firing or "requesting a 
resignation" can be done without 
specific cause. Where professors 
have tenure and secretaries have 
labor unions, managers have 
nothing but their own political 
skill to keep themselves ill office. 

Dr. Watson, however, although 
he has friends in high political 
places (Gov. Reagan and 
Superintendent of Public Schools 
Max Rafferty among them), says 
he has always been unpopular 
with politicos on campus and 
therefore doesn't stand a chance 
of having his case heard. 

He feels that Murphy's ac-
cusations of inadequate-services 
and poor student relations with 
the Health Center are unfounded. 
"UCSD has better insurance 
coverage at a lower cost than any 
other UC campus, and a system 
has been worked out so that 
students can become familiar 
with their doctors and make 
friends with the staff in the health 
cent~r _ 

Dr. Watson also feels that his 
constant contact with students in 
the center keeps him on better 
terms with them than Murphy 
could boast of. Murphy, on the 
other hand, says that "everybody 
knows" how poor the reputation 

. of the Student Health Center is 
among students - expecially 
medical students ~ and how 
uncooperative Dr. Watson has 
been in making innovations and 
expanding services. The most 
recent controversy of this sort 
has been about the incorporation 
of a gynecologist into the medical 
program on campus and the 
dispensation of contraceptives by . 

~e center. 
Moreover, the doctor has had a 

poor relationship with the 
philosophy department in par-
ticular ever since he started the 
Student Health Center in 1964. 
"They don't want the other side 
to be heard. I'm not the only one 
who has been 'let go' because of 
my political views. The first 
manager of the bookstore and 
John Geddes, a student affairs 
counselor. , were 20tten rid of for 
the same reasons," claims Dr. 
Watson . 

Geddes was well known as a 
conservative, who published his 
opinions of the campus in the 
pages of the SAN DIEGO UNION. 
Murphy insists that Geddes left of 
his own free will last year after a 
dispute concerning a raise in pay. 
He could fIIlt comment on the 

situation with the first manager 
of the bookstore, sonce he was not 
on campus in 1964. He did say, 
however, that neither Geddes nor 
Watson were dismissed or 
released for political reasons. " I 
want a director who will be more 
cooperative," claimed Murphy. 

The situation is fairly uncertain 
for Dr. Watson himself. He has 
been informed of the search 
committee's existence, but has 
been kept in the dark about their 
findings . He has been asked to 
remain at the Student Health 
Center as a doctor, but Murphy 
says that even that will be con-
tingent upon the new director's 
discretion. At any rate, official 
appointment of a new man would 
not take place until July. 

The 24 member board is ex-
pected today to accept the recom-
mendations of the 18 member Ed-
ucational Policy Committee and 
approve the plan. 

Acting Provost Frazer said the 
expected enrollment of Third Col-
lege next fall is 200 students, 50 
of whom are expected to be at 
the upper divison level. 

A total of 16.5 faculty FTEs 
(full- time equivalent employees) 
have been assigned to the college 
in 1970-71. 

The plan's quick approval came 
as a result of Chancellor McGill's 
effort to make it "academically

Tuition Compromise Proposal 
Rumored For 'Today's Regent Meeting 

by Rich Heimlich 
sources of revenue can be es-
tablished. 

Interviews with UC officials and 
Sources at the UC Board of individual Regents indicate Rea-

Regents meeting in San Francis- I gan 's plan will ge t 13 votes (out of 
co yesterday indicated that a cen- a total of 24) just enough needed to 
tury of tuition-free education at 
the University of California is a-
bout to come to an end. 

The Regents are expected to 
pass a fee increase of some sort 
today, butnoone is sure what form 
it will take. 

Initial feelers by news mn here 
have indicated that a compromise 
plan by Gov. Reagan will be pre-
sented to the Board to amend his 
previous deferred tuition plan in-
troduced at the last meeting. 

The governor said yesterday 
that he feels the Regents will de-
finitely make a decision on th 
tuition matter today. 

Befor adjournment at last 
month's meeting, UC President 
Charles Hitch said a decision on 
tuition must be .made at the Feb-
ruary meeting, because the ni-
ve rsity construction budget i de-
pleted and no new construction 
can be authorized until additional 

win, and up to 18, if, as one regent 
put it, " the polictical screws are 
tightened.' , 

Reagan introduced his plan at 
last month's meeting in Los Ange-
les. Like Hitch's proposal, the 
plan calls for undergraduates to 
pay $480 in September and $560in 
the fall of 1971. The main objec-
tion to the Reagan plan is that it 
provides no provisions for student 
aid, as Hitch's did, that there was 
no guarantee that the revenues 
produces would go to the univer-
sity and not to the state's general 
fund. 

It was learned yesterday that 
Reagan may have modified his 
plan so that the r venues would go 
directly to UC, and that he will 
make some policy stat ment re-
garding increased student aid to 
remove th objections to his tui-
tion plan. 

Hitch's plan allocates 500/ of 
the revenues collected to the bad-

ly needed construction funds, 
whereas Reagan's doesn't. Ano-
ther serious difference is that 
Reagan's plan provides deferment 
for students who demonstrate fi-
nancial need. 

Hitch argued that the deferred 
tuition plan would not bring in the 
needed revenues until the next 
10 or 15 years. 

State Superentendant of Public 
Education Max Rafferty, an ex 
officio mem r of th Board, is 
expected to offer his own tuition 
plan, a co mp licatio '1 that may well 
divide the cons natives on the 
Board and deny Reagan a victory. 

In addition, it a.; learned du-
ring yesterday's cor.lmittee mee-
ting here that Regent Coblentz, 
Roth, Dut l', :l.nd F :bc.:. ~r ...... cr. 
side ring joining in a suit again t 
the University if tuition is im-
po ed. Th uit would be initiated 
on behalf of th ::.tuents and 
would argu that tuition is uncon-
stitutional under the equal pr 
tection clau of the Fourteenth 
Amendm nt of th US Constitu-
tion. 



CPS Nelvsbriefs 

'Riot' Follows Tuition Sit-In 
At Ohio University in Athens more than 500 

students were involved in brick-throwing 
incidents at the main administration building 
on Jan . 30. after 150 students occupied the 
building Jan . 29 to protest increased tuition. 
Several students and police received minor 
injuries in what the student newspaper. THE 
POST, termed a riot, when police moved in to 
guard the building during the Jan. 30 
demonstration. Ohio National Guardsmen 
were put on alert as students protested both 
the tuition increase and University President 
Claude Sowle's refusal to meet with the 
student protest group, the Coalition of Con-
cerned Students. during the building oc-
cupation. 

Forty-six students were arrested. and this 
touched off further incidents aimed at police 
handling of the situation. The campus police 
office was teargassed. forcing it and a dorm-
itory in the same building to be evacuated. 
There were also numerous bomb threats. 
including one at the 'campus radio station 
while Sowle was holding an on-the-air 
question session with students. Simultaneous 
false fire alarms were also set off across 
campus. 

A city injunction was granted against nine 
specific students to prevent them and 100 
" John Does" from assem"'ing on or near 
university property. This essentially made all 
student assemblies illegal. 

How the nine names for the injunction were 
picked became a point of contentien, as 
several of the students listed claim ed to be not 
involved in the disturbance ; two were student 
newspaper reporters, and one was out of the 
city at the time. Atfirst. university police and 
investigators denied knowledge as to how the 
names were picked. but Sowle later admitted 
these two groups and "other administrators" 
had selected the names based on photographs 
of the sit-in at the administration building. 
Sowle admitted there could be mistakes and 
said the university would apologize for any 
mistaken-identity cases. 

In recent days the 17.750-student campus 
has been calm. as students have held 
organizational meetings to work out what 
action to take next. Sowle has announced he 
will seek inquiries into the student complaints 
regarding police actions. 

Tuition at Ohio University has risen 
drastically in the past two years, and the state 
legislature has failed to increase its ap-
propriation to higher education enough to 
prevent the continued fee hikes ~tudents 
complain that the administation is not lob-
bying hard enough to prevent the continuous 
fee hikes. which are making a college 
education impossible for an increasing 
number of students. 

SDS Endorses Work·ln 
LOS ANGELES - (CPS) - The 

Progressive Labor Party (PLP)-oriented 
faction of the Students for a Democratic 
Society (SDS). in a National Council meeting 
here. has overwhelmingly endorsed the 
concepts of a student summer " work-in" at 
large industrial plants and 0 Campus Worker-
Student Alliance (CWSA ). 

Over 500 students from across the country 
met in the Embassy Hotel here after being 
refused permission to meet at all local

campuses . They heard SDS National 
Secretary John Pennington tell them that the 
refusal of local colleges to allow them to meet 
was a "sign of our growing success," because 
" the bosses are afraid of us. " 

Pennington said there were two main 
questions confronting SDS. The first was 
whether .students should ally with workers. 
and if so. how it should be done. The second 
was how SDS could increase its base of sup-
port among students. 

Unlike last summer's raucous SDS con-
vention, the affair here was relatively 
peacefUl. 

SDS believes it is necessary to ally with the 
workers because only they have the power to 
" shut it down . .. Since it is not now possible to 
ally with workers in basic production, the 
CWSA attempts to ally with campus workers 
" who face the same bosses we do." 

In doing this, through fighting over such 
issues as wages and working conditions in 
campus cafeterias, SDS hopes more students 
will be attracted to SDS. " We'll expose the 
'liberalism' of administrators by showing how 
they're just like other bosses," said one SDS 
member. 

'D.C. Nine' Trial Ends 
WASHINGTON - (CPS) - The seven 

remaining members of the " D.C. Nine." the 
group that ransacked the offices of the Dow 
Chemical Company here as a Viet Nam War 
and napalm manufacturing protest on March 
22. 1969, have been convicted of illegal entry. 
They face sentences of up to 20 years in 
prison. The other two members pleaded no 
contest when their trial opened earlier this 
month. 

Several of the nine are clergymen. including 
one Catholic nun. The seven were acquitted of 
burglary charges. The defendants did not 
deny they entered the Dow offices. but termed 
it a morally correct form of civil 
disobedience. In his closing argument, 
Defense Attorney Addison Bowman said " the 
D.C. Nine had acted in a great tradition oj 
civil disobedience . .. of Jesus . Martin Luther 
King and those patriots who maliciously 
destroyed tea in Boston harbor. Would you 
convict them ?" The prosecution argued , 
" This was not courage. This was the result of 
arrogance . ... they know what is right for 
you. " 

The week-long trial was marked by heated 
exchanges between defense and the judge and 
one fist -swinging incident in which the 
courtroom was cleared . A youthful gallery 
observed the proceedings through the week. 

The jury took only 40 minutes to come up 
with its decision. 

Mayor Vetoes Raid Plans 
SEATTLE - (CPS) - Although the 

Federal Government wanted to stage a raid 
on the Black Panther headquarters here. 
Seattle 1.1ayor Wes Uhlman vetoed the idea. 

The mayor said such raids are reminiscent 
of " Gestapo-type" tactics. " A great many 
people are having second thoughts about 
midnight Gestapo-type raids. " he said. The 
mayor said a federal law enforcement agency 
asked for the city to help with an "information 
gathering" raid on Panther headquarters last 
month. The raid did not take place.

Cecil Poole was one of the Justice Department's key em-
ployees. and the first black U.S. Attorney, until he resigned 
Jan . 31. He said that the Justice Department is coming 
dangerously close to encroaching on civil liberties and Bill of 
Rights safeguards in its zeal to appear as a tough law en-
forcement agency. He claims that the department is "out to 
get" the Black Panthers. In an interview he stated: I think the 
Department of Justice has a commitment to do those things 
which enhance its image as a tough law enforcement agency 
(and) it is apt to tread dangerously close to those actions we've 
thought we progressed beyond. Prosecutions are heavily in-
volved in the area of one's beliefs and ignore the sensibilities o/' 
the Bill of Rights." 

TimetBble Asked 
Last week, the Na tional Policy Council of the Democratic 

Party called lor "a firm and unequivocal commitment" to. 
withdraw all U.S. forces from Viet Nam on a definite 
timetable. The council announced : " We see no reason why this' 
withdrawal should not be completed within 18 months. Such a 
withdrawal can be accelerated by efforts to create the con-
ditions necessary for a peaceful political settlement." This 
Viet Nam declaration was substant ially what the council's 20-
member Foreign Policy Committee, headed by former Am-
bassador W. Averill Harriman , had proposed. 

PeBCS Bnd Freedom PBrty 
The Peace and Freedom Party will run candidates in this 

year 's state elections. Charles T. Webes, a 29-year-old party 
recruiter from Long Beach will run for governor, and John 
Haag, of Venice. will run for U.s. Senator. However. the party 
might be willing to support George M. Brown for Senator, now 
a candidate for the Democratic party nomination for that post. 
If he loses the nomination, most PEP members would 
probably support him. according to Haag. To stay alive as a 
legal party qualified for the California ballot. a PEP can-
didate in a statewide race must receive at least 2 per cent of 
the total vote. One of the problems the party is encountering in 
fielding a slate of candidates is filing fees, which Weber and 
Haag feel is excessive. 

los Angeles Polics 
Last Sunday (Feb . IS) an article on the Los Angeles Police 

Department appeared in West Magazine of the LOS 
ANGELES TIMES. There are many different divisions of the 
department, and the question posed at the beginning of the 
article was whether treatment of suspects and prisoners is the 
same in most branches, as between Watts . Hollywood , and 
West L .A. branch. The reporter, William Drummond. who 
spent about a month going from headquarter to headquarter 
asking questions and Witnessing criminal proceedings, con-
cluded that there was indeed a great difference in the treat-
ment of suspects, that the whites in West Los Angeles are 
treated better (by orders of magnitude) than the blacks in 
Watts. The policemen's rationale is that the blacks are much 
more dangerous and hostile. Whether this treatment of blacks 
mollified pollce-citizen relationships is left unanswered. but 
inferences can easily be made. 

No OrBft Director 
Lewis B . Hershey has finally retired from thl< post of 

Selective Service Director. and as of this writing President i 
Nixon has been unable to replace him. Thus the office is 
vacant. The President has been searching for a replacement 
for four months, and has approached at least 30 persons. The 
most recent candidate has been Charles Dibona , an Annapolis 
graduate. He bowed out after severa l members of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee objected to his insistence that he 
be free to speak out, whenever and wherever he chose. against 
the draft and in favor of an all-volunteer armed forces. Nixon 
didn't object to this. but Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman John Stennis did. saying that he would have an 
ad ve rse impact on morale of local draft boards. Among others 
that President Nixon approached were three football coaches 
from Indiana University. the University of South Carolina. and 
Ohio State. None accepted. 

AClU Criticizes Contempt 
The chairman of the American Civil Liberities Union is 

charging that the contempt charges that were slapped on all 
the defendants and the ch!ef defense lawyers last week in the 
Chicago EIGHT trial are unconstitutional. Edward J . Ennis 
told a press conference that the ACLU was not questioning the 
right of a juuge to punish contempt immediately after a 
disruptive act , but whether a judge could sentence a defendant 
for summary contempt many months after the contempt 
occurred. According to an ACLU statement. summary con-
tempt procedures are " reserved for exceptional cir-
cumstances and unusual situations, where It is necessary to 
summarily and immediately vindicate the dignity of the 
court." Except for those "exceptiona l" situations. Ennis said. 
a judge must present his contempt charges in writing. refer 
the case to another judge. allow the accused to reply to the 
charges in writing. and assure that all constitutional 
safeguards with re~pect to the right of trial be carried out.

"We do not liave the power to

Lenny Bourin, Muir senator,

at Tuesday's AS Senate meeting, 
he was reOectlng the lbnited 
purview of power available to the 

. Associated Students. In an effort 
to better define what II allowed 
and how to execute the AS's 
authority, AS President Jeff 
Benjamin ordered a new com-
mitee to look into the Gt4. b~aboo 

Bruce Morden and Cindy Nielson, 
Revelle Senators. 
of any bureaucracy, 
"reorganization.' , 

The major problem en-
countered by the committee 

. chaired by Revelle Senator Bruce 
Morden was where the AS fits 
into the UCSD scheme of the 
college system. Clearly, he 
found, the AS should play the part 
of the "central government" and 
provide services and funds for 
activities not possible at the 
college level. Publishing the 
TRITON TIMES, presenting 
major concerts, and operating 
large financial ventures like the 
Coffee Hut are examples of such 
activites. 

But in a sense the colleges can 

Lenny Bourin and Mark Elson, 
Muir Senators. 
produce similar services with 
sufficient funds . Revelle could 
easily operate the Coffee Hut; 
" Dimension" could be Revelle 's 
newspaper; and Muir ' could 
provide small concerts atld 
cultural programs. 

Morden and the conunittee 
members, who represented} both 
colleges, the AS, the TRITON 
TIMES, and upper and lower

divisions, concluded that the 
boWldary line between college 
and campus must remain fuzzy, 
but there are certain things Muir 
and Revelle should do for 
themselves. 

" The college governments 
should be primarily responsible 
for the functioning of the college 
conununity ," Morden reported to 
the AS Senate. " Such items as 
residence halls, guest-in-
residence programs, faculty 
relations, course requirements, 
and commuter students" would 
be obvious areas of concern for 
the colleges. 

To bridge the gap between the 
central and local governments, 
Morden suggested that the AS 
allocate funds to Revelle and 
Muir according to some formula . 
At present revenue from the 
vending machines (some $7000 
per year) goes to the colleges, the 
School of Medicine and Scripps 
on a prorated basis. In the future , 
the AS could allocate perhaps 25 _ 
per cent of Its fWlds to the 
colleges on a per capita basis. 
But Morden 's committee did not 
propose any specific level of 
support. 

A final c~lnsideration 

Jim Magill, Upper Division,and 
Paul Kaufman, Lower Div. Sen. 
Morden's group was the con-
stitutional connection between 
the AS Senate and the college 
governments. As Deans Alan 
Batchelder and Tom Hull, of 
Muir and Revelle respectively , 
have pointed out, the AS is 
strictly student~riented, while 
the Muir Council and the Revelle 
Committee on College Affairs 
(RCCA) are student- and faculty-
oriented . The result of this 
disagreement in authority is 
confusion about which body 
should do what . 

One suggestion was a com-
bination of the AS Senate with the 
Academic Senate, an 
arrangement now operating at 

Jeff Benjamin, 
Palclc, Vice-President. 
CA>lumbia University. But the 
Regents would have to approve 
the change , because the 
Academic Senate includes only 
profesr.ors (and a few ex~fficio 
members, e.g., the chancellor 
and vice-ehancellors ). 

Another solution was found in 
organizing UCSD in a "cluster 

Steve Ishmael, 

Muir Senator. 

system" of three or four colleges 
to a cluster. plus nearby in-
stitutes and schools . Thus 
Revelle, Muir and Third College, 
plus the School of Medicine, 
would compose Cluster 1. An 
intracampus government 
reflecting views of all units would 
operate on the same basis as the 
college governments now func-
tion, I.e ., with faculty and ad-
ministrati ve representation. 

Finally, the answer to this 
problem was avoided by 
suggesting that the AS revise its 
1966 constitution to allow the 
colleges to devise their own 
systems for representing 
students on the Senate. A com-
bined student-faculty body for the 
campus will have to await new 
discussions between President 
Benjamin and Academic Senate 
Chairman Gabriel Jackson. 

Until revisions can be made, 
the AS must continue to struggle 
with its own problems 
irrespective of the feelings of the 
individual college governments. 
The 1970-1971 budget will be 
drawn up in April. New elections 
will be held at the same time. And 
new committee appOintments 
will be made in May. 

To be able to influence these 
campus-wide decisions, the 
college governments will have to 
come to some concrete un-
derstanding with the AS Senate. 
This mutual agreement would be 
particularly helpful to Muir and 
Revelle because the AS nert year 
will have some $75,000 to spend on . 
student services. Some of this 
money could be allocated to 
them.

Beer Proposal 
Falls Flat 

Owen Joyner 
Staff Writer 

Proponents of the plan to obtain an on-sale beer license for the 
CA>ffee Hut have met a discouraging impasse. The obstacle in a law in 
the State CA>nstitution forbidding the issuance of liquor licences to 
groups such as the ASUCSD. The disappointing facts were uncovered 
by an ASUCSD conunittee, expressly appointed to investigate the 
feasibility of selling beer at the Coffee Hut. The negative report of this 
conunittee issued by Jim Magill, upper division Senator, reflected 
thoroUj!h consideration of the state liquor laws, University policy and 
advice solicited from various legislators and liquor authorities. 

The essential barrier here is the interpretation of an excerpt of the 
State Constitution which reads : " ... the legislature shall not con-
stitute the State or any agency thereof the manufacuture or seller of 
alcoholic beverages." The Regents of the University of California is 
such an agency of the state. The ASUCSD operates under the auspices 
of Regents and thus may not engage in the sale of alcoholic beverages. 

There exist further restrictions. The various sections of Penal Code 
172 provide that it is a misdemeanor to sell or expose for sale any in-
toxicating liquors within one and one-half miles of the Los Angeles . 
San Diego, Irvine , and San Francisco campuses. There are several 
exceptions to this law. The only one that might apply in this case is 
that of a caterer's permit for the sale of alcoholic beverages. The 
caterer here would be John Lapetina and the Hi Continental Corp. The 
problem, however, is that the cafeteria facilities are University-
owned. therefore excluding the cafeteria from a license under the 
CA>nstitutional law previously mentioned. 

University policy more or less reflects the State regulations in 
regard to liquor on campus. Yet , no penal code forbids the con-
sumption, non-sale, or giving away of alcohol , nor does the University. 
In fact. University policy expressly permits the service of a 
" beverage" at occasional special events, provided those attending are 
21 or older. 

The expertise consulted on the subject seemed to concur with the 
statutes also. Assemblyman John Stull, while friendly to the idea of 
promoting a more congenial Coffee Hut , found any further pursuance 
of a liquor license a waste of time. The authorities from the State 
liquor Board ~Iso shook their heads regrettably and pointed to the 
laws. They also referred to a precedent. The Student Union at UCSF, 
where over 90 per cent of the student body are 21 or over. was denied a 
permit for selling alcohol under the State constitution. 

The ultimate conclusion of Jim Magill 's committee was to recom-
mend to the ASUCSD that it concert with other UC campuses to seek 
the repealment of that problematic constitutional clause. Meanwhile, 
it was suggested that consideration be given the fact that no law says 
beer can't be given away.

Me$sage Information Center to 
Open, Will Serve Varied Needs 

Raoul Contreras 
Staff Writer 

The Office of the Vice-Chancellor has announced 
that a campus information center will begin 
operations soon. 

legal barriers and responsibilities. However, the 
center's phones will be manned by students. 

The information clearinghouse, which is being 
coordinated by Dean of Student Affairs Robert F . 
Topolovac, is tentatively scheduled to start 
operating on Feb. 26. The center, which is located in 
250 MC, has as its purpose " to provide needed in-
formation to the academic community." It will 
attempt to do this by storing academic, campus and 
community information and thereby making only a 
phone call necessary to find out about classes, 
schedules, advisors, social events, lectures, movies 
( including X-rated ones ), restaurants, and 
meetings on campus. It will also try to provide the 
when, where, and who about campus and com-
munity services, volunteer work, special projects 
and interests, and the procedures and contacts 
necessary for the student to initiate activities 
himself. 

Betsy Beloff, a researcher in the Counseling 
Office who provided the impetus for the information 
center, says it has been designed "relatively un-
structured" in order to make it fit the particular 
needs of this area . Miss Beloff explained that the 
need for such a center became obvious to her when 
she moved into her new position in August, and had 
more trouble settling in than she had at Berkeley 
with an academic community ten times as large. 
She feels that the center can provide a useful ser-
vice if, by establishing a list of contacts, it can 
"avoid the run-around and remove channels" for 
the student. She also mentioned the need to redefine 
office titles, which often don't indicate the title-
holder's true function . . 

On the crisis-intervention function, Miss Beloff 
stressed that the center wouldn't try to give advice 
itself but would provide reliable referrals. She 
mentioned a list of 19 groups specializing in drug 
abuse and how they were being sorted out to find 
those which would provide no legal problems for the 
student.

Jim Sills 
Staff Writer 

If the need should arise, the information center is 
also ready to serve in a crisis-intervention capacity, 
by providing " trustworthy" referrals to doctors and 
counseling and psychological services. 

A third function of the center will be to act as a 
message-relay point for people who are usually out 
of phone contact for much of the day. 

The information center , which is temporarily 
budgeted for six months, has been organized as a 
university function in order to bridge financial and 

Miss Beloff also stressed the importance of the 
center as a message relay point. In conclusion, 
however she felt that the most important thing to 
convey was that in order for the center to succeed 
" it must be helped by the community it serves. We 
must be used not only by those who need in-
formation , but those who have information. " 

" . . . a policy that has guided 
our state for a hundred years and 
has been as successful and as 
beneficial as the policy of a 
university without tuition is a fine 
policy, and I think the proposal to 
change after a hundred years of 
success is a very radical kind of 
change and, I think, a very un-
fortunate one ." So spoke 
Hamilton Marston, San Diego 
merchant , as the campaign 
against increased student fees 

She said that the center's direction and futme 
would be determined by how it is used.

Vernon, a UCSD professor, 
revealed that a state-wide 
organization, California Citizens 
Against Tuition, had been for-
med, and was circulating 
petitions. 

Members of the Emergency 
Committee met again the next 
night at UCSD to make final 
plans before the Regents ' 
meeting (Feb. 20). 

Prof. Vernon reported that 
6,000 signatures had been 
gathered locally on a petition 
calling for " . .. no qualified 
student to be turned away from 
the University or State colleges." 
He added that these, as well as 
the Emergency Committees' 
official statement, would be 
forwarded to the Regents when 
he attended the Feb. 20 meeting. 

Prof. Walter Kohn reported 
that Regent Dutton (often con-
sidered a liberal) would in-
troduce an amendment to the 
Reagan plan (to increase fees to 
660 dollars in two years ) to 
exempt some students from 
increased fees . "Specifically," 
said Kohn , " students whose 
parents' families make less than 
13,500 dollars , or married 
students whose income was less 
than $7,500 a year. 

The general feeling of the 
committee was that the Governor 
could get increased fees if he 
wanted them.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Books, 
Forests' 

Editor: 
I would like to make a modest 

proposal. We should aU try to 
wipe out the existing population 
of trees by accumulating vast 
personal libraries. We should 
retain books for the sake of 
having them near us, regardless 
of whether or not we are likely to 
refer to them. The effect of this 
would be to cause the makers of 
books to plant new trees, clearly 
in line with the fashionable 
emphasis on ecology. The 
publishers have assured me that 
this is a good plan. They point out 
that part of the reason 
refor~station has not already 
begun is that students and 
professors are not depleting the 
old forests quickly enough. 

They have asked me to en-
courage you to buy more books to 
speed up the process of 
defoliation in order that the new 
planting can begin. I would like to 
add to this that the slowdown is 
partly attributable to students 
and fac:.alty who irresponsibly 
distribute among their friends 
books they do not find essential 
for their own work. Are you one of 
these?

America ... 
Arab Enemy 
Editor : 

By continuing to seek a 
military confrontation between 
Israel and its neighbors, America 
risks starting another Viet-
namese-style commitment. 
Under the guise of Zionism our 
country may bring slaughter to 
Jews and Arabs alike. America 
seems all too ready to continue 
the fine Super-Power tradition of 
massacring powerless peoples. 

Why are we in the Mideast? 
First , America has its oil 
" rights" to protect, Second, we 
want to keep the Suez Canal 
under pennanent U.S. control. 
After all, the Suez Canal 
threatens to be truly in-
ternational in the sense that 
anyone could use it, whether or 
not "we" like it. The Suez Canal 
is the only Soviet sea passage to 
the Indian Ocean. Not being too 
just or fair , our far~ighted 
diplomats prefer to maintain 
Mideast tensions , and keep the 
canal closed. 

I have been told by well-
educated and brilliant Arabs that 
a coalition of govemmt!nts is 
possible, but that U.S.-sponsored 
militarism in Israel prevents it. 
All people could live in harmony. 
Nasser would have no popular 
support to fight Israel if the 
threat of American military 
domination was absent. The Arab 
states do not like fighting 
America, for it would be better to 
be an ally of the United States 
than of Russia, simply because 
we provide more aid and trade.

But we are forcing the Arab

it dearly. 

The real enemy of the Arab 
countries is the United States. 
Nasser should nationalize aU 
American oil interests, and so 
should all the other Arab coun-
tries. Then, we could row the 
warships into battle. Meanwhile, 
Jewish lambs line up for the 
slaughter.

Movement 
Must Die 
Editor: 

Having attended the UCLA 
rally (February 14) concerning 
the Chicago conspiracy, I can 
only say that s~ial change in this 
country depends critically on the 
death of the protest movement. 
The rally itself was a marvelous 
social success: many people met 
friends whom they had not seen 
for a long time; everyone seemed 
to enjoy the rock band and the 
singing of Phil Debs; and, yes, 
some of the more rabid dissen-
ters were even moved to dance . 

As social events, protest rallles 
are not characte'rized by the 
decorum of cocktail parties, but 
nevertheless have a certain 
predictability which even the 
decerebrate zombies of Straight 
City must admire ( though 
latently). For instance, at these 
rallies, the major characteristic 
of dissent is conformity : the 
repeated chanting of " right on" 
by 2000 people or more falls far 
short of the ideal of individualism 

so treasured by nono(:onforrnists. 
There are at lea!>t three courses 

for the future . 
1. "Uberals" can continue to 

talk to one another and hold 
rallies with each other. IT this 
course is adopted, let me 
nominate "thick" as the "heavy 
expression" for March, and 
"electric" as the one for April, in 
lieu of continuing with "right on" 
(since this expression does in fact 
have an unfortunate political 
reference) . 

2. Those opting for change can 
engage in the physical 
destruction of those with whom 
they disagree. This is sometimes 
referred to as the " foreign 
policy" technique. 

3. One can say "no" to 
lobotomy, and thus reject the 
traditions of society and take 
positive action by forming an 
alternative social structure 
modeled after one of the many 
types of communal social groups 
which now exist in California and 
other states. Uving on a com-
mune is not likely to appeal to too 
many "liberals" since it 
demands action rather than talk. 

Alternative number three 
seems to me to be the most 
sensible choice. In any case, I am 
convinced that the conformity 
exhibited by the protesters of 
today does not bode well for 
social change, for conformity is 
also a characteristic of the 
Decerebrate Majority.

UC Reneges 
Editor : 

At the beginning of this sc.hool 
year there was a considerable 
number of resident students who 
were tripled up in the Matthews 
Campus doms. The tripling was 
done in a r.ompletely arbitrary 
fashion by the resident deans 
with little or no previous notice of 
the situation to the students in-
volved. 

Most of us who were involved in 
this inconvenience, which lasted 
for forty-four days, accepted the 
situation because we were made 
to understand that there would be 
a refund on our housing 

payments commensurate with 
the tripling situation. Now we are 
told that it has been decided that 
there will be no refund. 

The university has acted in bad 
faith by breaking the un-
derstanding which they made 
with us . They have dealt with us 
in an arbitrary administrative 
manner by breaking the 
agreement without a ny con-
sultation with the students in-
volved. We think that all of the 
students on this campus should 
be made awar e of the 
maneuvering which the 
university has used to deprive us 
of funds to which we are entitled.

BlalTttltlALI 
It's Bigger 
Than Chicago · · 

The repression coming down these days in America is 
so many-sided and multi-faceted that it's really har~ to 
keep up with. As a student newspaper and a pnm.e 
source of commul1i<:atilJr,:; on t~lis (.arnplJS, we've f~1t It 
our duty to expand our coverage to relevant national 
issues, especially those that doh't get the. best coverage 
in the commercial press. We were gOing to run an 
editorial this week on the miscarriage of justice that is 
the Conspiracy Trial, but felt that it was impossible to 
come up with anything at all profound unless wedealt 
with the sub j ect to the deg ree that is nece.ssary. Next 
week a compilation of highlights from the tnal ~athered 
by the College Press Service ~ill. ~e printed In. an .at-
tempt to begin to convey the significance of thiS tnal. 

This week we've sought to focus on a local issue, but 
one that fits right in with the Conspiracy and the 
national pattern - the persecution of .the Move~ent for 
a Democratic Military by the local police establishment. 
With the permission of the L.A. Free Press we are 
reprinting an account of what transpired recently as 
described by Mark Lane, noted journalist who wrote 
"Rush to Judgment" in connection with. th~ Kennedy 
Assassination. This is in lieu of an editorial on the 
subject, for his vivid description says it better than any 
rehashing of the incidents. 

MARl( LANE 
The San Diego Police Department, 
after conspiring with the Shore Pa-
trol (Naval Police) smashed down the 
door of a San Diego store front on 
J Street Sunday evening to break up 
a peaceful meeting of Marines, Sail-
ors and civilians. 

The illegal ' and violent action fol-
lowed several hours of terror on the 
streets in the vicinity by the local 
and military police during which ci-
vilians were threatened and detained . 
by the cops and Gl's were taken into 
custody, physically pushed around and 
finally arrested on non-existent charg-
es. Among the witnesses and victims 
were Barbara Dane, Donald Duncan, 
and Irwin Silber of The Guardian. I 
was there too. 

The night before, Barbara, who is 
to the growing GI anti-war movement 
what Mort Sahl is to the J FK ass is-
sination investigation (that is, almost 
the only consistent voice) sang and 
rapped with the Marines in a garage 
in Vista, California, not far from the 
Pendleton base. 

Both the Saturday and Sunday even-
ing meetings were organized by the 
newly formed Movement for a Dem0-
cratic Military (MOM). Don Duncan 
joined us Sunday afternoon in Vista 
and we, together with the civilian or-
ganizers there, named the Green 
Machine Project, and a number of 
Marines, drove down to San Diego for 
a joint meeting with the naval chapter 
of the MOM. 

The meeting in a store in downtown 
San Diego called the Waiting Room 
began with a sailor reporting on police 
harassment of the project. He said 
that in just over one month, 23 mem-
bers of MOM had been arrested on 

charges ranging from a non-regula-
tion haircut to illegal assembly. The 
latter bust occurred as the members 
quietly filed out of a meeting. Others 
had been arrested for distributing 
their. newspaper, Ducl< Power. The 
official charge - blocking public side-
walks. The Waiting Room opened on 
December 28, 1969. In the next five 
weeks virtually every GI member had 
been arrested at least once and the 
civilian organizers detained by the 
police three times. Since the charjles 
were fraudulent even the military con-
cept of justice could hardly result i~ 
successful prosecution. Seventeen 
charges were later dismissed; five 
are still pending. One, distributing the 
newspaper, resulted in a verbal repri-
mand. The sailor reported that on 
January 15 police broke into the Wait-
ing Room and rifled the files. The next 
day a San Diego based F~I agent 
called a member to ' offer him S25 a 
head for every deserter he turned in. 

As the report went on, I glanced out 
of a window and saw two Shore Palo ... 
(SP) cops who were making a complete 
check of tl, .. cars parked in front of 
the Waiting Room. Each had a flash-
light, a huge club, and a -pistol. They 

wrote down license numbers and 
peered into the cars, flashing the 
lights through the windows. 

I grabbed my Uher tape recorder, 
put it on, asked a photographer friend, 
Carolyn Mugar, to at-company me. We 
walked up to them. "Why are you writ-
ing down my license plate number?" I 
asked. They looked at ttie recorder and 
froze into silence. Carolyn photo~ 
graphed them. 

They turned away and half ran lown 
the block. One whipped out a walkie-
talkie. Within seconds two gray SP 

p'... TribMI TinIs fellrVlry 20, 1170 

vans arrivecf. One cut me oH. An SP 
jumped out and demanded to know if I 
was in the military. If so, I was sub-
ject to immediate arrest. I told him 
that I was in the Army when we were 
fighting against fasdsm, not for it. 
He dashed back to his radio and 
within JO seconds two San Diego 
Police cars arrived. A cop demanded 
my identification. "What's the charge, 
officerl" He looked up and said, 
"Well, er, using a tape recorder o~ 
the street." Three minutes later hiS 
supervisor arrived and told him to 
drop the charge. The cops split and the 
street was empty again.

. throulh the window for the camerl-

~n to unpack the camera and set up 
before the door was smashed. I turned 
to the lieutenant, "00 you have a 
search warran"" He snapped back. 
"We don't need one." 

'psted that he arrest the SP and ent';-
tlin the complaint. He laulhed 19ain . 
Then the lieutenant led a police 

. charge Into the Waiting Room. The 
'door, still unhinged a~d precariously 
.leaning against the frame provided ~o 
real obstacle this time:. When we told 
the cops to leave, the lieutenlnt a~. 
swered, " We want to see everyone s 
identification." I asked why and he 
replied, "These people are all pos-
sible witnesses to a crime." I told 
him that no one who was in the Waiting 
Room could have witnessed the crime 
which took place on the street and 
several doors away. I also told him 
that we could provide the witnesses 
for him right then and I urged him to 
make an arrest before the SP disap-
peared. He grinned. I called Captain 
Allen who assured me that the lieu-
tenant knew what he was doing. The SP 
who committed the crime walked 
through the street, brushing past 
police officers and left the scene. 
Meanwhile, methodoc:ially, the cops 
demanded the names and addresses of 
everyone in the Waiting Room, ci-
vilian and GI, drew up a brief descrip-
tion of each, height, w~ight, color of 
eyes, while others copied informa-
tion from the bulletin board and 
calendar of events. 

Fifteen minutes later the street was 
crawling with police and SP vehicles 
and personnel. One Marine, due to be 
discharged the next day, after ~I- ~ 
years In the Corps and 18 mohths in 
Viet Nam decided to go out for a cup 
of coHee: He was grabbed by a police 
officer, then surrounded by three 
patrol cars and six cops. He was 
searched and made to stand with hi 
palms against a squa? car. I askerl 
the oHicer what was gOing on, after ex-
plainingthat I was the Marine's lawyer. 
The cop, Patrolman Berg, sai?, that I 
was going to be arrested also. Really. 
What's the charge?" He replied, "We'll 
think of one, you son of a bitch." 

When the supervisor arrived, 
charges against the Marine and me 
were abandoned. Once we were both 
freed I called the Police Department to 
complain. Captain Allen, in charge C?f 
patrolmen, seemed sympathetiC 
enough at the start. later i was to 
realize that my call would have been . 
equivalent to Custer calling for more 
Indians. At the moment, however, the 
police street excesses appeared to 
result less from a high level agree-
ment and more from individual cop 
stupidity. 

A little later two Marines and a 
civilian organizer from the Green 
Machine Project walked into enemy 
territory out on J and toward Fifth 
Street. Two SP's ordered them to 
stop. Two other SP's came up, one 
a six foot seven giant who kept 
mumbling to himself while he ner-
vously played with his club. The two 
Marines were searched, roughly 
thrown into the SP van. When I asked 
what the charges were, the SP called 
the police. I was again detained. This 
time I broke aw.ay and ca!led Ca~t. 

But, for coldly 
calculated police state 
destruction of basic 
rights, I have never

'Allen. He said he was sending Lt. 
Sturm (phonelic) at once. 

The'lieutenant arrived an.sf said that 
. I could be released. By that time an 
army of cops and SP had gathered out-
side the Waiting Room. Sturm shouted 
through the door, "Open up or we'll 
break the door down." I was out on 
the street surrounded by the local 
military police. Three civilians stood 
in front of the door, reluctant to leave 
the way open for the cops. Carolyn 

. just kept shooting away with her two 
Nikons. 
- We had filmed the early part of the 
meeting at the Waiting Room, and the 
camerd had been packed away. Now, 

, with the cops threatening to break 

"Why no"" 
"We have probable cause of a crim4!! 

being committed In there." 
"What crime? By who?" 
The cop turned to the ~P an~ as~ed 

what crime they were investigating. 
The SP said, "They have a sailor in 
there who is UA (unauthorized ab-
sence)." The lieutenant turned back to 
me and said, "If you don't get them t? 
open the door we're going to break It 
down." 

... What's the 
charge?" He replied, 
"We'll think of one, 
you son of a bitch." 

. "What's the name of the suspect?" 
I asked. The lieutenant turned to the 
SP and said, "What's his namel" The 
SP said he didn't have any name. 
"We'll know him when we see him," 
he explained. 

Those arrested were denied the 
right to make a telephone call, were 
not informed of their rights, and not 

I told the lieutenant that there was 
no reasonable cause for breaking the 
door down since there was no reason-
able basis to presume that a crime was 
being committed. "A face is ~ot UA. :f 
the man is wanted for UA hiS name IS 
known." At that point the SP, the 
lieutenant and I all knew that the door 
would be broken and some innocent 
man dragged out of the meeting room -
and thrown into a waiting van. We also 
knew all of us, that no one In there 
was ~anted for UA or any other crime. , 

'. even told of the charges against them. 

As the cops prepared to smash the 
door down we heard the strong voice 
of Barbara Dane begin to sing: 

I'm going to prison 
For what I believe 
I'm going to prison 
So I can be free 

And then the Marines and their sup-
porters sang with her-

I've something to 
What more can 
I've something to 
And how about you.

By now the cameraman was set. 
Flood ' lights lit the interior of the 
Waiting Room, all focused on the 
inside of the door. The lieutenant 
gave the order. Cops dragged the 
dviliilns away from the door. Two 
cops charged forwilrd and kicked 
and pushed at the two doors. One 
door gave; it was torn off its hinges. 
The cops stepped aside and the SP 
charged in . One of them grabbed a 
young man. In order to avoid a 
serious mistake the SP asked the man, 
"Are you in the military?" When he 
replied in the affirmiltive he was 
dragged out and thrown into the van. 
The question had to be asked. If a 
civilian was charged with UA the SP 
woUld have been ernbarassed. Yet, 
the question reveilled more clearly 
than before that there had been no sus-
pect, that the false charge of UA was 
the ilgreed upon pretext to break up 
the meeting. 

The SP retreated with their pris-
oner and the streets appeared to be 
empty again. I took a short walk and 
saw that the area was still well 
staked out by police and SP, some on 
foot, some in vehicles, and all out of 
dire<:! view from the Waiting Room. 
They were waiting for t~e Gl's to 
leave. The Gl's in the Waiting Room 
were hostages. It was apparent that as 
soon as they stepped out onto the 
street they t'oo would be arrested, 
searched, pushed around and thrown 
into the vans . A photographer for the 
Streel Journal, an underground San 
Diego newspaper, arrived on the scene. 

One of the men in the SP van heard 
the radio bark, "Try to get close 
enough to grab the .cam~ras _and ~e-, 
stroy them." The Street Journal photo-
grapher took a picture of the tall, ner-
vous SP. The two SP men moved in on 
him. One grabbed the camera from 
him, ripped it outof his hands and offof 
the chain around his neck that was at-
tached to it. He held it high in the air 
and then threw it on the ground. It 
broke Into several pieces. The SP 
then picked up the largest remaining 
piece and hurled it onto the street 
again. Then, he turned to the startled 
photographer and said, "Sorry about 
tha!." A number of people, including 
Carolyn, who photographed the epi -
sode, SilW the crime committed. The 
police were on the scene in large 
numbers again. 

Several officers had to have wit-
nessed the crime. The photographer 
tried to file a complilint with Lt. 
Sturm. The lieutenant laughed. I sug-

Finally, they were driven to the SP sta-
tion in San Diego and jailed there, then 
driven to the Marine Corps Recruiting 
Depot in San Diego and jailed there, 
then taken by bus to the jail outside of 
the Provost Marshall's office at Camp 
Pendleton and placed in an outdoor 
cage, there during the cold rain. Some 
of the men were released late Monday 
afternoon. They had been falsely ar-
rested the night before. Most had not 
been given breakfast or lunch. They 
had not been permitted to sleep. 

What evidently upset the Navy and 
Marine brass initially was the march 
of almost one thousand Gl's on Dec. 
14. They had carried posters which 
cried, "Bring Our Brothers Home; 
Keep Us Here" and "End Racism 
Through Solidarity." This, followed 
by serious organizing efforts at Sa~ 
Diego and near Pendleton threilten~< 
the totalitarian hold of the military 
over the men it commands. The news-

, papers published by the sailors at San 
Diego, Duck Power, and the Marines 
at Pendleton, Attitude Check, are 
stilrting to catch on, and they repre-
sent just two of the more than fifty 
underground papers published by anti-
war and military GI's. They began to 
remind the lifers that the people, not 
lifers, built the American military 
during World War II to fight Hitler 
and his cohorts. And the people who 
put the military together ~n by man 
can take it apart ~n by man as well. 

The spirit of the busted Gl's is high.

Corps hymn on occasion. The ACLU

Cafeteria._.Promises, But No Action 
Last week an article appeared in the 

TRITON TIMES about the cafeteria. The 
bulk of the article consisted of responses 
from John Lapetina and the ad-
ministration to the leaflet put out by the 
Campus Worker Student Alliance Com-
mittee . In the article Lapetina attempted 
to deny the charges in the leaflet. 

Lapetina said that the layoffs mentioned 
in the leaflet were the result of " in-
tentional temporary overstaffing." But the 
students laid off wel'e not told they were 
temporary when they were hired. They 
signed an agreement to work through 
finals week just like everyone else. If 
Lapetina wants to hire temporary people 
and tell them, that's one thing. But that's 
not what he did! 

In response to the discussion of unsafe 
working conditions, Lapetina said that Hi 
Continental was fully insured. But in-
surance does not prevent accidents, fur-
nish safety mats, fix broken equipment, 
etc. People still get hurt, are not well taken 
care of, and pay for much of the costs of 
this insurance out of their own pockets . He 
said that the demand for safety mats was 
the only valid demand and yet at the same 
time denied that any of the accidents 
mentioned resulted from the lack of mats. 
That people slip and fall Is the result of the 
lack of safety mats, not their own fault as 
Lapetina implied. The floors are slippery 
from water and grease. That people have 

to rush and thus fall more often is not 
because they are not cautious but because 
of Wlderstaffing. Since there often are not 
enough people working , workers have to 
rush to get students served. 

The university says that mats will be 
installed as soon as possible. As of this 
writing they have not been put in . For four 
years the Wliversity has not put them in , 
nor have the food contractors requested 
them. When (if) they are put in , it will not 
be due to Hi Continental's or the univer-
sity's concern for the safety of workers but 
die to the action of students and workers 
demanding these improvements. 

Lapetina also denied political criteria 
for hiring and firing and denied 
questioning workers about the leaflet. But 
experienced workers who are in SDS and 
CWSA were not rehired at the beginning of 
this quarter and have been fired since the 
circulation of the leaflet for "not wearing a 
hairnet," " wearing tennis shoes," and 
" stealing" a 10-cent drink - things 
everyone who works for the cafeteria does 
and things that are usually ignored or that 
at most, people are warned about. At least 
two workers at Revelle - John Burns and 
Kathy Boland - were called in by 
Lapetina and asked if they knew anything 
about the leaflet, If they were connected 
with it, and if they knew anyone who was . 

The article continued by saying that 
wages at this cafeteria were good because 

they were higher than those at most other 
cafeterias and were above the minimum 
wage. Two-fifty an hour may be above 
minimum wage, but that does not mean 
it's a living wage. Most UCSD cafeteria 
workers do not work the whole year. They 
are laid off over Christmas, over quarter 
breaks, and for most of the summer 
(unless there is a convention at UCSD 
when they are called in to work ). That 
means that at $2.50 an hour the cafeteria 
workers here get only $4000 a year. The 
government poverty level is at $3300 amI 
the level for a minimum adequate stan-
dard of living is set at $10,000 a year ($5.00 
an hour ). 

The CWSA committee intends to con-
tinue the fight to improve working con-
ditions in the cafeteria and elsewhere in 
the Wliversity. It is crucial that workers 
and students ally to fight the things that 
hurt them . We have already won some 
things - a new person was hired to work 
in the Revelle dishroom, eliminating orne 
of the speed-up there, and mats have been 
promised (al though not yet delivered ). We 
will have to fight harder to win job securi ty 
for full and part-time workers, to protect 
people from harassment and firings due to 
their militancy, and to win other changes. 
Meetings of the CWSA committee are 
every Monday night at 9 in lower Blake 
lounge. Join us . Cathy Rose

successlw in achieving outright 
donation of 15 acres of land to the 
park extension campaign, in 
exchange for a zoning change in a 
different area . The parcel , 
d9nated by the Pardee Brothers, 
at $150,000. Immediately after 
this another developer , Wyer and 
Johnson , donated eight acres of 
land and an access road , valued 
at $300,000, and subsequently 
received a rezoning on another 
parcel of land they C;vJlPti. The 
net result of this activity was thus -
equivalent to a cash donation of 
$450,000, or half of the necessary 
private funds . 

The efforts of Ed Butler on 
behalf of the Torrey Pines 
Association have netted about 
$200,000 since then . Thus, the 
total amount of funds that has 
been released and raised by 
concerned citizens has been 
about $650,000. 

The deadline on raising the 
other $250,000 was extended to 
February 22 by the Torrey Pines 
Association. If the money is not 
raised by this date the state will 
withhold some of their matching 
funds and the full 170 acres will 
not be purchased. 

For some time now studentS at 
Muir College have been con-
cerned with envi ronmer.t.:ll 
issues. They are attempting to 
diffuse the spirit of conservation 
and preservation of the en-
vironment that John Muir im-
parted to the school. Bob Munk 
has done considerable work in 
organizing the Torrey Pines 
campaign, and Provost Stewart 
has indicated his approval of the 
idea. But a final push is 
necessary if the campaign is to be 
successful .

to California 's redwoods, once 
said that "if you I ve seen one, 
you've seen them all. " If tIDS

The . Cloisters 

Age has wiped both color and form from 
many of the great works of medieval ar-
tists. The exhibit at the ws Angeles 
County Museum of Art, "The Middle Ages : 
Treasures from the Cloisters and the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art," presents 
some of the often-unseen chromatic and 
plastic arts of the Age of Fa\th. 

The exhibit is on loan from the famous 
collections of the Cloisters and the New 
York Metropolitan Museum of Art, which 
has been called the best collection in the 
world. This is a somewhat misleading 
statement, because Europe has Gothic art 
on almost every corner and hardly needs 
to "collect." 

There is, however, no question that the 
show is an unprecedent:?d opportunity for 
Southern Californians to see a large 
selection of excellent, representative 
. rks from ainlost every stylistic period, 
and covering every motif except the more 
massive architectural works. 

The exhibit includes many remarkable 
pieces of the late Roman-early 
Romanesque period, including the famous 
Antioch Chalice. Of silver, the chalice 
holds approximately a quart, pointing out 
the size of the ancient congregations who 
all shared the Eucharist. This piece and 
others are from archeologlcal finds in 
Syria, Egypt, Crete, Greece and many 
other Levant and European sites. 

Th show does present many elements 
that are common, but usually unknown to 
contemporary Americans. For example, 
the often common reliquaries had ex-
tremely important legal and religious 
roles. The presence of the holy relics en-
sured both the sanctity of oaths and 
religious services that were essential to 
the legal forms of medieval society and 
jurisprudence. 

The size of the exhibit also allows other 
aspects of medieval art to be clarified. The 
many enamals, the tapestries, and the few 
statues that preserve all or some of their 
polychrome finish point out the color that 
the people of the Middle Ages used on ' 
almost everything, and that contemporary 
man does not associate with the plain stone 
work that remains today. 

The many small if not miniature pieces, 
including the d'Evreux Book of Hours and 
the small tryptyches show that cathedral 
concerns did not monopolize medieval 
artists . The two large tapestries, 
illuminating lines from Petrarch, show 
that medieval work did not depend solely 
upon Christian materials. 

The show also includes enough pieces to 
s Ow a development from the late Roman 
period through the Romanesque and to the 
end of the Gothic period, detailing 
Byzantine, Moorish , Scandinavian and 
even oriental influences. It is unfortunate 
that the exhibi ' was not arranged 
chronologically, b It the catalog does allow 
one to make seJlSl! historically among the 
many works . 

The catalog is rather large, and ex-
tremely well done . with an "arty" essay on 
and picture of end: pi",.,. The 
photography and reproduction are clear, 
and the color p!at.es are chromatically 
consistent with tte originals . The written 
material contain> much information of 
interest and som~ genuinely enlightening 
discussions of contextual and iconographic 
detail . Unfortunately, the ambition of the 
catalog is reflected in the ambition of the 
price. 

The show is at the ws Angeles County 
Museum of Art, considerable distance 
from San Diego. The show is interesting 
enough to, however, warrant a trip, and 
many UCSD students will be able to visit 
the exhibit over the spring break, as the 
show is open until March 29. The museum 
itself has a rather limited collection, 
twused in some department store ar-

chitecture, but it does include several very 
fine pieces, including a statue of Balzac by 
Rodin that dominates the stairway . The 
park itself is rather curious , being the site , 
of the La Brea Pits, tar pools that have ' 
been found to be depositories of Ice Age 
fossils. One pit is partially excavated and 
open to the public . 

By Larry Johnson 

The musical new year has opened on 
rather a sour note in San Diego. The opera 
and the ballet are or have been WIder 
pressure, but the sourest note of all con-
cerns the San Diego Symphony. The 
symphony, a fine cultural asset to San . 
Diego since 1927, has come on very hard 
times. 

To begin with, the symphony always 
operates in the red . According to sym-
phony manager William J, Phillips , even if 
every seat in the house were sold at every 
concert, ticket sales would cover only 
about one-third of expenses. As it is, ticket 
sales cover only 24 per cent of expenses. 
The slack must be taken up by city and 
county donations (12 per cent of the 
budget ); sales of memberships in the 
Symphony Association, and other 
donations from individuals and public-
spirited corporations (40 per cent ); a Ford 
Foundation grant (12 per cent ); children 's 
concerts (4 per cent ); and 8 per cent from 

" The Virgin of the Annunciation," (from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's latest exhibition of the Medieval art 
treasures, from the Cloisters collection .

women's committees' activities (annual 
ball, fashion shows, etc.) . 

The symphony has difficulties making 
ends meet with such financing. In fact, the 
first concerts of the year had to be can-
celled. The orchestra members wanted a 
finn guarantee of the number of per-
formances they would play and be payed 
for, but there wasn't enough in the till to 
guarantee anything. Finally, the orchestra 
agreed to work one program at a time, as 
money became available. They currently 
have enough money for a few more con-
certs, but unless money comes in faster 
than it is corning in now, the rest may be 
cancelled. The summer season has 
already been cancelled. 

The long-term outlook is quite sobering .. 
Contracts come up for re-negotiation in the 
fall, and wage hikes will be expensive. The 
symphony has Wltil next year to raise 
funds to match a Ford FOWldation grant of 
$500,000. If San Diego can't dig up its half 
million, the symphony won 't get the Ford 
money. 

Music is important to the cultural life of 
a city, and the symphony does a fine job of 
making the best classical music available 
to us. Certainly the university should be 
among its staunch supporters. UCSD gives 
contemporary music a lot of interest , but 
classical music is given a lot less support. 

On April 26, UCSD will sponsor a benefit 
concert to be given at the gym. A 33-person 
chamber group from the orchestra will 
play, with all expenses covered by UCSD 
and all proceeds going to the Symphony . 
The night may raise seven or eight 
thousand dollars for music. 

While students don 't have much money 
for donations, they can attend concerts . 
Students can get a 30 per cent discount , 
and can get in for a mere $1.50 a haIf-hour 
before performances. But don 't think of it 
as a donation : even with all those white 
shirts and tails on stage, an evening at the 
symphony is a great way to spend an 
evening. 

Well, enough about the sym;>hony 's 
financial woes. 

Clothes don 't make the man, and only a 
fool would judge by external appearances. 
Right? Right. And nobody knows this 
better than the sophisticated younger 
generation. Right? Wrong! This, at least is 
the opinion of 24-year~ld Misha Dichter, 
guest pianist for last week's concert of the 
San Diego Symphony . The young Dichter, 
an internationally known pianist, feels that 
many younger people stay away from the 
symphony because of the formal nature of 
the concert hall. For this reason, he 
dresses casually for his own recitals, 
though he dresses formally when he ap-
pears with a formal orchestra . 

Those who stayed away because they 
couldn 't stand the sight of a white shirt 
certainly missed a fine pel'formance. 
Dichter was superlative in the difficult 
Brahms Piano Concerto No.1 in D Minor, 
not only mastering the keyboard but also 
displaying interpretative genius. He 
brought out the full spirit and richness of 
tone of this difficult Brahms masterpiece. 

Dichter was given excellent support by 
the orchestra under the able baton of 
Zoltan Rozsnyai ; they brought out the full 
force of the concert. 

Opening the program, the orchestra 
gave a fine rendition of Haydn's 
"Military" Symphony No, 100 in G Major. 
It is called ' 'military'' because of its in-
strumentation, which includes some extra 
brass and percussion, and not because of 
any military character of the music itself. 
Soft, lazy, and luxuriOUS, the symphony 
was anything but military. The orchestra 
responded well to Rozsnya!'s unhurried 
conducting . 

Completing the program was " The Tale 
of Issoumbochi," a Japanese fairy tale set 
to music. And such music ! Celeste, sand-
paper blocks , maracas , and Indian 
cowbells were featured . Would you believe 
elephan t bells? 

All this takes place to an ap-
propriately oriental musical backdrop. It 
was narrated , in a somewhat too06yrupy 
manner, by Robert E. Lee , a local TV 
announcer. Emma Small, a soprano with a 
lovely voice, vocally represented the hero , 
doing an excellent job of interpretation . 
One of the instrumentalists for the piece 
was the composer, David Ward Steinman , 
a local musician of increasing note. 
Altogether the evening was very en-
joyable .

Henrik Ibsen's famous drama, 

" An Enemy of the People," will 
be performed at UCSD on 
Saturday evening, Feb. 21, at 8 
p.m. in the second-noor 
auditorium in the Basic Science 
Building of the Medical School. 
Attendance is free and everyone 
is invited. 

" An Enemy of the People" is 
about a scientist who discovers 
that the water supply of his 
native town is polluted and 
dangerous to health . His 
discovery brings the wrath of the 
town's financial and political 
leaders down upon him, leading 
him at one point to declare : "The 
most dangerous enemy of truth 
and freedom amongst us is the 
compact majority-yes, the 
damned compact Liberal 
majority! The majority Dever 
has right on its side ... The 
minority is always in the right." 
The play is as fresh and pertinent 
as when it was written, almost ' 
one-hundred years ago. 

Ibsen's play will be performed 
(in the version by Arthur Miller ) 
by a group of trained actors 
under the direction of Minerva 
MarquiS. Their production has 
had a brilliant success at the 
Jewish Community Center in San 
Diego . It is being brought to 
UCSD under the auspices of the 
Department of Literature , with 
added financial support from 
Provost Saltman of Revelle 
College.

periences in the jungles of 
Westchester. The film follows the 
young hero as he meets the most 
feared animal in all of West-
chester jungle land, the rich, 
pretty, over sexed Jewess. 
Beware, for she may appear soft 
to the touch, pleasing to the eye, 
but under that carefully 
manicured exterior is the soul of 
a leopard . Will the leopard 
pounce on the hero and eat him or 
will the hero down the she-wolf 
and eat her, or will they mutually 
masticate? Tune in starting on 
Wednesday for the gripping truth 
at 7:00 and 10:15 for "Goodbye 
Columbus" at the Unicorn.

" Los Tarantos," a Spanish film 
featuring the flamenco of Car-
men Amaya will show at 8:50.

Student Expose~ Police Agent 
By LorralDe Evemham 

Staff Writer 

Undercover agents on UC campuses? Not 
only possible, but true! Accusations made by 
local radicals that a Berkeley police officer 
has been masquerading as a student at 
Berkeley for the past four months, in a par-
tially successful attempt to infiltrate three 
radical organizations, were admitted last 
week - after an earlier denial - by the 
Berkeley Police Department. 

Roland Soliz, who had been posing as 
"Roland Guzman," Chicano activist, was 
discovered by student Craig Pyes. Pyes said 
he became suspiciOUS of Soliz and finally 
discovered his identity through a July 30, 1968 

ph~to in the Berkeley GAZE'ITE which 
showed Soliz graduating from the Berkeley 
Police Training School. 

As soon as he was exposed. officer Soliz was 
ousted from RSU (Radical Student Union). 
YSA (Youth Socialist Alliance ), and SOS. 

Pyes claims that. at the time of exposure. 
Soliz admitted he was an undercover agent 
for the Berkeley Police and then proceeded to 
discuss "why he had been posing as a 
student." 

Immediately following the exposure, an 
attempt was made by RSU and the DAILY 
CALIFORNIAN to verify the information 
concerning Sol,iz . At that time the Police said 
they had no knowledge of Roland Soliz or of 
" undercover officers" at Berkeley. 

However. in an interview with thP. DAILY 
CALIFORNIAN, Berkeley Police Ueutenant 
Henry Sanders finally admitted that Roland 
Soliz was working for the police department. 
He said Soliz had been using the alias of 
"Roland Guzman ... for several weeks now 
while seeking information for the department 
on the activities o( various radical groups on 
the Berkeley campus." 

Sanders also confirmed that the policy of 
sending police undercover agents to pose as 
students is not a new one. "We often send 
undercover police onto campus to infiltrate 
various groups." he said. 

The Berkeley Police Department has 
proposed a plan to begin a helicopter patrol 
over Berkeley. The helicopter proposal calls 
for the purchase of two small helicopters and 
the training of three pilots from . the police 
force . The project. which would cost in excess 
of $250,000 for the first two years, would 
provide police with air surveillance of the city

The police say that since the helicopters 

will be of the "observation type," they will not 
be used (or large-scale tear-gassing. The 
police did admit that the helicopters could 
carry tear-gas grenades ; they still hold , 
though , that the aircraft are too small to 
carry Large amounts of gas . 

. Strong opposition to the proposal has stalled 
proceedings. Opponents contend that the 
helicopters will add to the noise and to air 
pollution . Opponents also raised the problem 
of the psychological effects on a population 
subjected to constant air surveilance . 

When the Berkeley City Council met last 
Tuesday to discuss the proposal, protesters 
effectively disrupted the meeting. A crowd of 
nearly 200 was forced to remain outside after 
the council chamber was filled . The crowd let 
off homemade stink bombs and shouted " Off 
the whirly-pig -let the people in." The 
Council was unable to successfully discuss the

From amongst the rolling 
hills and quiet wilderness of 
UCSD's campus, the looming 
Central University Library 
slowly nears completion. 

Approaching the library 
thro ugh the trees, one is 
suddenly struck by its enor-
mity and uniqueness. Upon 
touring the partially con-
structed building as this 
reporter did with Mr . Joseph 
Gantner, Assistant University' 
Librarian, these feelings are 
intensified. The library, with 
its eight floors of different 
sizes and huge concrete sup-
ports, gives one the impression 
of a giant space ship of Star 
Trek vintage. 

The eighth floor, the furthest 
from completion but with the 
most impressive view, will 
house the University's rare 
book collection. The thought of 
spending a free afternoon high 
atop this unique structure, 
overlooking the eucalyptus 
groves and studying a rare old 
manuscript, seems the 
ultimate in aesthetic pleasure. 

The fourth floor, the same 
size as the eighth, will house 
the music and art collections 
and listening facilities. In 
addition to the usual cir-
culation desk , offices for 
library staff, and catalogues: 
and reference material, the 
main floor will contain a data 
processing center, a 
photographic dark room, 
microfilm storage, an area for 

preparing damaged books for 
the bindery, and a maze of 
numerous other rooms for 
labeling, filing, and secretarial 
work. 

Designed by William Periera 
and Associates and built by 
Nielsen Construction Company 
of San Diego, the library's 
official name is presently the 
Central University Library. In 
1968, the Triton Times took an 
editorial position supporting 

renaming of the library as the 
John G. Galbraith Library in 
honor of the former UCSD 
chancellor's efforts in funding 
the library. However , ac-
cording to Melvin Voight, Head 
University Librarian, no ac-
tion has been taken on this or 
any ' other name. It will be 

several years, he indicated, 
before the Faculty Committee 
for the Naming of Streets and 
Buildings and the UC Regents 
agree on a permanent name 
for Central Library. 

The library is scheduled for 
completion in July 1970, and 
will have taken two years to 
construct since its ground-
breaking on July 1, 1968. If all 
goes according to plan, it will 
be in operation for the Fall 
Quarter 1970. 

Though primarily a 
graduate research library, the 
entire library will be ac-
cessible to all UCSD students. 

No stack passes or library 
cards will be required, 
although student ID cards will 
be needed to borrow books. 

Despite its originality of 
design and space allotment, 
some (most notably the San 
Diego Union), have criticized 
the structure as being inef-
ficient and expensi ve . Its 

,110,000 square feet of floor 
space will house 700 ,000 
volumes, whereas the average 
capacity for libraries of this 
size is 600,000. The total cost 
will run to $5,700,000 at $26 .50 a 
square foot, with the average 
US academic library costs at 
$27 to $28 per square foot. 

The new building wui ac-
comodate the library'S 
collection, expanding at the 
rate of 100,000 volumes a year, 
for approximately two to three 
years, at which time two ad-
ditional buildings will be 
planned in the Central Library 
vicinity.

PILJIL

THOU 

By SU88D Gravell 
Gunt Writer 

The problems related to the pill in the U.S Senate scare 
last month are extremely overrated, said a panel of 
gynecologists and obstetricians who participated in a 
University Extension one-<iay conference, Saturday, 
Valentine 's Day. Only one doctor out of seven, an in· 
ternist, was against the use of the pill until more studies 
had been done. . 

The problem of overpopulation is not foremost in most 
families' minds today when they consider birth control, 
said moderator Dr. Katherine F . carson, on the staff at 
the University Hospital. What is important is that "each 
child have his own quantity of mother love ." 

Dr. Walter Ornstein, also of the University Hospital, 
pointed out some statistics on the effectiveness (or lack of 
effectiveness) of various contraceptives now in use (each 
statistic was calculated on a 100 woman·year scale; that 
is, 100 women watched for one year).

Dr. Ornstein pointed out tbat although the pill aeemed to 
be the most effective, if a combination of two other means 
of birth control were 118ed, one could also receive, in most 
cases, very good results. Most of the doctors agreed, 
however, that the single girl, unless there are some other 
individual complications, should probably be using the pill 
if she Is having sexual intercourse. 

About 11Mlladles and "several" gentlemen attended the 
conference to learn the unique effects the pill has in the 
prevention of pregnancy. The pill is a combination of 
estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones already 
produced in the body. There are twenty different com· 
binations of these two hormones to be found on today's 
market so that each doctor can personally "tailor" a pill 

. to a specific person's needs. Dr. Ornstein pointed out tJuit 
when the pill came out ten years ago, it was 20 times 
stronger and cost about $10.00 per month compared to 
today's $2.00. . 

The disadvanta&es of the pill are varied. The possible 
side effects of the pill such as weight gain, nauseau, and 
breast soreness usually disappear after two months. 
These effects, according to Dr. Ornstein, compared to 
possible fatal complications of pregnancy such as toxemia 
or hemorrhage which are not associated with the pill, are 
small indeed. The suppression of ovulation over a long 
period of time may cause sterility, but there are new 
drugs on the market that may reverse the process. Dr. 
Ornstein noted that 7 per cent of all women have primary 
sterility, but this should be considered when looking at 
statistics. Dr. Ornstein also discussed the problem of 
blood clotting and cancer. A woman on the pill has a four 
times greater chance of dying from blood clotting than a 
non-user. This figure was compared to women smokers, 
who have a death·rate of 6.4 per cent, and the conclusion 
made by Dr. Ornstein is that "the pill is about as 
dangerous as smoking three cigarettes a day." 

When discussing cancer, Dr. Ornstein said that there 
was no proof that cancer was produced by the use of the 
pill. but that estrogen may aggravate cancer of the breast 
ifalreadyieveloped. He also pointed out that breast cancer 
occurred more often in women who had had several 
children and that cancer of the cervix occurred more 
often in those persons having intercourse early in life or 
having multiple partners. 

One good effect of the pill is in preventive medicine. It 
forces a woman to have periodiccheck-ups with her doctor 
to have her prescription renewed. In this way, problems 
normally not found until too late are diagnosed much 
sooner. 

The non-contraceptive uses of the pill were outlined by 
Dr. Purvis Martin, Clinical Professor at University 
Hospital. The pill may be used to stop and start men:;truaJ 
flow, relieve cramps, rest the ovaries when tired out, test 
for pregnancy, tone skin, prevent hysterectomies and 
cancer. A serious problem for mature women is en· 
drometriosis, a condition where certain portions of the 

uterine UnIng attach tbemaelves to otber parta of the 
pelvic area and caUle heavy bleeding, pressure and pain. 
Under nonna! cases, a woman would have to undergo a 
hysterectomy very soon, but she has a respite through the 
pill. Through the use of the pill, doctors can check for 
sterility and assure middle-aged women of few accidents 
before menouause. 

Dr. Ralph J. Howlett talked about alternatives to the 
pill, and discussed the historical significance of the 
contraceptive. He said that women had been douching 
since 1800, but, of course, the results have not been very 
good. The famous casanova used a device he called his 
"assurance cap" which was a linen sheath. The condum 
was invented in 1790 by a ~lonel Condum who used dried 
sheep gut to prevent venereal disease. With vulcanization 
in 1844 and liquid latex in 1900 condum-making became a 
major business. In 1936, 1·1/ 2 million condums were used 
daily. Other strange concoctions were okra seed pods used 
by South American natives and crocadile dung used as a 
jelly in Egypt. Today's contraceptives are usually jellies, 
foams, diaphragms, cervical caps, sponges filled with 
spermacidal fluid, each of which has to be inserted before 
every instance of intercourse to be effective. The in· 
trauterine device of IUD is a permanent fixture, inserted 
and removed by a physician, but can usually be used only 
by women who have had at least one child.

Male and female sterilization were also discussed, as 
well as abortion. Japan has legalized abortion, but has not 
legalized the pill. Nevertheless, according to Dr. Brenner, 
another UCSD panelist, the birth rate in Japan has 
dropped from 2.5 per cent in 1955 to less than 1 per cent 
today. 

"The case Against the Pill" was discussed by Dr. 
Winston Hall, Internal Medicine, who felt that the pill's 
use must be determined by its effect on each individual , 
and that it was not possible to draw conclusions for at 
least another ten to fifteen years. He said the pill had 
effects beyond possible infertility, that the chemicals 
were active in the body outside of the female organs. The 
pill may modify the water'A1t environment in the body. It 

. also might cause genetic concer.n. He pointed out how 
suppression of other glands such as the adrenal and

effects on jaundice of the Bver, diabetes, and hyper· 
tension, and c:li8cuued the relationahip of fat content to 
arterial scler0ei8. He quoted that 9Ii per cent of all pill 
users bad a raise in rat content in their bodies. 

'The other phYllcians on the panel, however, quickiy 
pointed out, and Dr. Hall acknowledged, that in )Jlost 
cases these problems were reversible, and that problems 
were somewhat less than if they had occurred through 
pregnancy. Furthennore, in many cases, no direct 
relationship had yet been observed between the pill and a 
number of these disorders. or.·iIall also discussed the use 
of large quantities of estrogen in animals to produce 
tumorous growths, but these coulo· not be duplicated in 
humans so far. He concluded that if the primary concern 
was a problem that limited life, as through pregnancy, 
then there was little to lose by use of the pill.

Dr. Paul Brenner of the School of Medicine, in answer to 
Dr. Hall, pointed out that the "pill must be taken with

that were aggravated by the pregnancy state, such as 
diabetes should not have the pill prescribed for them

bleeding and is not available for the public. He talked 
about the pill in drinking water, with an antidote to 
produce fertility, but this would upset hormonal therapy. 
He felt that the pill and abortions should be readily 
available to the high risk groups, and pointed out that the 
highest percentage of abortions performed were on 
college students. "The basic right of the unborn is to be

the U.S. will have half a billion people. He felt that there

more than their share of babies, and rewards for those

Gold Medalists Will Seek 
Records in. Games Tonite 

lIy Stevl Darsch, Sparts Uitar 

The 1970 edition of the San Diego Indoor Games 
will unfold tonight at 7 p.m. on the very fast Sports 
Arena boards. The 1969 Indoor Games were ranked 
by Track and Field News, the Bible of the sport, as 
the best of the entire season. 

The 27~vent program also includes the San Diego 
CIF Indoor High School Championships. Milton 
Mitchell of Lincoln High may well break the 
national high school record of 57.8 in the 500-yard 
run which he set himself in last year's meet. 

Meet director Ralph Smith has also lined up what 
promises to be a record-breaking group of track and 
field performers on what is &enerally considered 
the fastest indoor track in the world. Each of the 
past two years has produced one record : Kerry 
Pearce 's 8:27.2 in 1968 and George Young with an 
identical clocking last year, both eclipsing the old 
world standard for the indoor two mile run. 

Athletes who will appear in tonight's meet include 
Olympic Gold Medal winner Joh'! Carlos, Kenya 's 
Kipchoge Keino. Willie Davenport, Dick Fosbury, 
Lee Evans, and Randy Matson ; plus Dave Patrick, 
Sam Bair, Otis Burrell, Dick Railsback, and 
perhaps two or three other last·minute additions. 
C.rlos, EVIns Shoot for World Records 
John Carlos, the big San Jose sprinter, has been 

virtually unbeaten for two years and will be 
shooting for the world mark of 5.9 for 60 yards. Lee 
Evans asked meet officials to change the 600 to 500 
yards because he wanted a shot at the world record. 
Evans ran 55.6 at the 500 yard distance earlier this 
season, one-tenth off the standard, on a slower 
track. Meet officials were happy to comply with the 
Olympic 400 meter champion's request. 

The mile run is deep and talented, headed by Gold 
Medalis~ Kip Keino, who expressed hope for a good 

attempt at the world indoor record of 3:56.4. Keino 
ran the 1500 meter event in Mexico City in 1968 in 
3:34.9, an effort equal to a su1>-3 :50 mile at sealevel, 
say many track experts and coaches. The Kenyan 
will be challenged by four other sub-four-minute 
mllers. Sam Bair, second.fastest mile in the world 
last year, European champion Frank Murphy, 
former UCLA star and NCAA record-holder Bob 
Day, and Dave Patrick, who beat Jim Ryun in the 
NCAA mile two years ago, will all pursue Keino in 
the magic mile. There hasn't been a sub-four· 
minute mile yet this season, but tonight's battle at . 
the Sports Arena looks like a sure bet to remove that 
statistic. 

Strong Lineup Set for Field Events 
Best duel on the field program should be in the 

shot put, where the number one and number two 
throwers in the world - Randy Matson and Neil 
Steinhauer - will match tosses. Randy is the 
world's only 70-footer and the Olympic Chamion. 
The only shot put record Randy doesn't already own 
is the world indoor mark of 67-10 held by Steinhauer. 

The pole vault field will be enhanced by thf 
late addition of John Pennell. World recort 
holder and the world 's first 17-foot vaulter, 
Pennell will be making his first start of the 
1970 season in the San Die ItO meet. 

The San Diego debut of the famous "Fosbury 
flop" in the high jwnp will attract considerable 
interest. Fosbury's flop was one of the most popular 
events at the 1968 Olympic Games, and his unique 
flopping style could wow the local crowd tonight, 
too. 

Track and field meets are not the most predic-
table of sports, but one prediction is certainly a safe 
bet - the 1970 San Diego Indoor Games won't be a 
flop! 

John Pennell, who will be fea.tured in the pole vault in the San 
Diego Indoor Games tonight, clears the bar at 17-feet 5-inches 
for a new world record in the 1965 San Diego Invitational Meet.

Matmen Top Pasadena, UCR 
A strong effort by the upper 

weights and a pair of forfeits 
gave the Triton grapplers a 24-18 
winning advantage over 
Riverside last Wednesday night. 
But the lightweight giants were 
out in full force Monday and 
sewed up a strong 25-11 victory 
over the Pasadena College 
Crusaders. 

Eddy Calugay was in typical 
feisty spirit, especially since he's 
used to starting the Tritons' 
victory march. So when he found 
out he was winning by forfeit, he 
just flashed his familiar devilish 
grin to tell some 118·pound 
Pasadenan that he was lucky to 
be absent. 

Speedy Correa attacked with a 
con trolled vengeance that 
provoked a unanimous " ulp" 
from the Pasadena bench . 
Although he compiled 11 points in 
the second period alone, and held 
two predicaments and two near 
falls, he just couldn't coax his 
Crusader opponent to a pin. ' He 
won by decision, 18-2. 

Wrestler of the Week 
The 134 match was just as 

excitingly lopsided as Bob Wilson 
completely and spectacularly 
dominated his opponent and 
twice came excruciatingly close 
to putting his shoulders to the 
mat. His 16-4 win earned Bob the 
"wrestler of the week" award. 

Nobody told Mike Ditomaso 
that his 142 opponent just hap· 
pened to be completely double· 
jointed, and the Greek had a little 
trouble hanging on to a cradle. 
The Pasadenan rallied in the 
second period by racking up eight 
points, but the Triton kept up the 
attack and took the match 14-11. 

John Gressard wasn't about to 
let Pasadena taste victory from 
his hands, so after a slow first 
period where the ref called his 

takedowns off the mat, John 
ripped and came out the victor, 7-
2. 

Pasadena compiled its 11 
points in the next three matches 
when Randy Ziegler fought off 
but couldn't prevent a pin and 
Fred Grunewald lost to his old 
rival Doug Steele. (These two 167-
pounders have a vicious triangle 
going with Sam Allen of Pomona, 
where Steele can't beat Allen, 
who can't beat Grunewald, who 
can't beat Steele . All three will 
get another crack at each other at 
the district finals Feb. 28.) 

190-pounder Joe Prenn and 
heavyweight Howard Clark 
finished the meet with a typical 
Triton display of power. Prenn 
pinned a man (in 7:49) who used 
to boast of only having had his 
shoulders to the mat once. Then 
Clark took over against a man 
who out·weighed him by forty 
pounds and turned on t~e 
aggression. At the final buzzer, 
his score was 7-3. 

The Tritons go into action at 
home tomorrow against San 
Fernando State. The match will 
be at 2 p.m. in the gym. 

John Ch,sl" Wins Downhill 
Skiers Third at Mammoth 
. Clear skies and bahny temperatures graced the widely-attended 
mtercollegiate ski competition at June Mountain on Feb. 7 and 8. 

Elev~n colleges and universities in Southern California competed in 
grueling contests between the skiers and a demanding mountain . 
Snow conditions were excellent, with the firmly packed base providing 
exce~~onal speed, but minimal edge control; a challenge only the bold 
of splnt would dare to meet. 

John Chester, a freshman from the province of Alberta, Canada, 
spearheaded the UCSD onslaught. On the first day he finished fourth in 
the slalom event. The winner was Jah Stehlik of UCLA, 1.5 seconds 
ahead of Chester. UCSD came within a breath of taking first in the 
slalom though, since Craig Sterbenz had a brilliant start on the dif· 
ficult course. But just as the end gate came into view, Craig lost 

contro~ and went into a wild, very serious plunge of some ISO yards 
downhill . The fall took Sterbenz out of the competition with 19 stitches 
and a ripped edge on his ski. UCLA then won the slalom, followed by 
Claremont College and UCSD. 

On the following day UCSD clearly captured the hearts of many 
spectators through the stunning performance of John Chester. In a 
dazzling run, Chester sizzled in ahead of not only all the other official 
competitors in the downhill race, but also the best instructors at June 
Mountain Lodge. 

Chester stuck to the fall line of the hill as if he had a plumb line hung 
from his nose. He seemed to float effortlessly through the turns and 
sailed thr~ugh the f!nish gate at an astounding speed. He negotiated 
the 5/ 8 mile downhill course a full second ahead of his nearest rival, 
Page of Claremont. Francy and Peterson of the UCSD ski team also 
were favored by the mountain and finished well enough for t.'le UCSD 
Ski Team to grab third place in the overall downhill standin~s.

Tritons Stage Counter Reformation 
. by Steve Dorsch. Sports Editor 

The Triton basketball team 
hit the crusade trail last week 
and came home with victories 
over the Baptists and Lutherans. 
The local cagers sandwiched a 
55-45 win over Cal Lutheran 
on the losers fioor between home 
triumphs over L.A. Baptist (94-
82) and Cal Baptist (96-60). 
The three straight victories 
improved the Tritons season rec-
ord to 12-11 with four games 
left to play. 

UCSD was at La Verne last 
night before moving on to the 
University of San Diego tomor-
row night, hosting Cal Lu~heran 

Thin clads 
Open Season 

The sports scene at UCSD 
began to round into full Spring 
form last Saturday as Coach 
Andy Skief took a portion of the 
Triton Track and Field team to 
the San Diego State All-Comers 
Track meet. The outcome was 
rather surprising and very en· 
couraging for the first com· 
petition of the sea~n . 

Bob Lemmon, a freshman from 
Huntington Beach, broke the 
school record in the high jump 
with a very good early season 
leap of 6-foot-4. The previous 
record of 5-foot-l0 was held by 
Tom Bigllone , set in 1967. 
Lemmon also tied the school 
mark for the 120 yard high 
hurdles with a clocking of 15.4. 

The track team will feature a 
number of other very fine fresh· 
man athletes who are expected to 
contribute a great deal to the 
success of the coming season. 
Tom Wolfe, the outstanding 
athlete of 1969, will return to 
action by Feb. 28, which should 
also be a giant boost to the 
thinclads. 

On Feb. 28, the Track team will 
open their official schedule at the 
Chapman All·Comers Meet. 
Coach Skief will be looking for 
some fine performances and 
steady improvelJlents from all 
members of the squad.

UC San Diego's intercollegiate 
baseball team opened its 1970 
season last Friday with a 6-3 
victory over Cal Lutheran at 
Robb Field. UCSD righthander 
John Weger went the distance .in 
the seven inning game to pick up 
the pitching victory. 

Weger struck out nine batters, 
many in clutch situations, to 
survive the shaky support of a 
somewhat porous defense that 
committed seven errors. Triton 
teammate Jeff McCombs was the 
hitting star of the first game this 
season with three singles for the 
La Jollans. UCSD collected a 
total of 11 hits. 

The baseball team will be in 
action again tomorrow in a 
doubleheader with Azusa Pacific 
beginning at noon on the Azusa 
diamond.

UCSD's predominantly freshman fencing team has shown surpris-
ingly good form this season. The Triton swordsmen upset San 

.Diego state 19-17 in a match last week. 

freshman fencers foil State 
Coach Jim White sat in disbelief as he watched his first year UCSD 

fencing team upset an experienced San Diego State squad at UCSD's 
gym last Saturday. 

San Diego State won the sabre competition 8-1, with Stan Strauss 
notching the Tritons' only victory. The Epee competition, however, 
ended with UCSD on the long end of a 6-3 score, with Jim Canole , Dick 
Sax, and John Hemlich each scoring two victories. 

In the foil competition, the men again dropped a 6-3 decision to the 
Aztecs, but Mike Jones, Davis Hayden, and Daryl Divininny each 
captured one point. The women exhibited the most thorough success of 
the day as the blanked San Diego 9-0. Terri Breschini, Susan Hillery, 
and Peggy Karplus each scored three victories . 

UCSD stunned the Aztecs with a surprising 19-17 upset that ran the 
Tritons' dual meet record to 3-1. The Tritons will host their final home 
meet of the season tomorrow against Long Beach State's undefeated 
and top ranked team of Southern California. There is no admission 
charge for the match, which will be held in the UCSD gym.
