Campus battles autoIDobile theft, burglary 
Report finds falling, but consistent crime rates 

IIy JESSICA HOlTON 
Staff Writer 

"Campus security" is a mis-
nomer for Eleanor Roosevelt 
College sophomore Mike Tam, 
whose 1997 cura Integra has 
been broken into three times on 
campus in the past year. 

The first time thieve tar-
geted his vehicle, Tam said he 
was impre sed that the univer it)' 
police responded quickJy, busted 
the criminals and returned the 
stolen goods. But after two more 
succe sfu l break-in , Tam aid he 
lost all faith in UCSD's security 
enforcement. 

"It's completely useless," Tam 
said. "] think they need some 
major improvement in the ecu-
rity on campus." 

Incidents of burglary and 
motor vehicle theft continue 
to plague the UCSD campus, 
according to data released by 
the UCSD Police Department 
in 2005-06 Crime Awareness and 
Campus Security Clery Report. 

The statistics, drawn from 
crime reports filed by various 
designated law enforcement 
authorities around campus, yield-
ed 63 reports of burglary and 89 
reports of car theft in 2004. 

The incidents of burglary 
were up from 49 in 2002 but still 
below the 65 logged in 2003,

D Webmail, which has 
b en plagued by capacity and pam 
e-mail problems, has overhauled 
a pe ts of its system's fearures. 

\Vebmail services were unavail-
able for account holders last week-

nd for a whole night, due to 
problems with the size and loca-
tion of where e-mails were stored . 

"We have changed where 
the files are stored -and enabled 
monitoring software to prevent 
[thl J from occurring," Academjc 

omputing ervices Director 
Tony Wood aid. 

Ilowever, the UC D Webmail 
ervice till malfunctions, accord-

ing to Eleanor Roosevelt College 
nior Rakdy Khlok. 
The e-mail ystem is so unre-

liable that Khlok is unsurprised 
when it doe crash. 

ther UCSD students have 
en ountered problems with spam

man Jamie Goldman, who fre-
quentl re eives per onal e-mail 
in h r ~pam box. 

' orne tudents, sllch as John

h.ne opted for a separate spam e-
Illad blo 'ker instead. 

"I f I didn't have a ~pam e-mail 
blocker, I'd be pretty annoyed," 
\Iier ,aid. 

rhe \ Vebmad 'pam filters 
help curb irrelevant e-mails ent

I1lJIt.ng lists, according to Wood. 
The e lists are not moderated and 
Pla have C D lila i I hosts tha t 
are not connected to the UCSD 
mail ystem, since tudents and 
nonstudent alike are able to post 
me ages. 

"We have found a high per-
centage of the messages are spam 
of the most blatant sort," Wood 
said. 

While S has attempted to 
"scorc" e-mails, which cva luates 
the likelihood that an e-mai l is 
spam, the Webmail sy tem has 
had trouble diverting or deliver-
ing the e-ma il to its appropriatc 
destination. 

For now, ACS will scek other 
methods of evaluating the e-l1lails 
from the other UCSD mail ho lS. 
The current sy tern ' spam fil-

However, that system sti ll has 
some kinks .

Desl?ite rise, aid lags 
behind tuition hikes 

The College Board statistics on 
university tuition and student aid 
released last week showed tha~ while 
increases in college costs are slowing. 
finanaal aid increases still not enough 
to accommodate students. 

The board found that tUition 
and fee increases a re still steepest 
at public four-year institutions, ris-
ing about 7 percent for the 2005-
06 academic year. Meanwhile, 
two-year public universities expe-
rienced a 5-percent increase and 
private four-year universities rose 
nearly 6 percent. The increase of 
room and board costs at public 
four-year universities was also the 
steepest, at 6 percent. 

Although college costs are grow-
Ing. the latest numbers show that 
the price or higher education is 
leveling off, according to a College 
Board press release. But while this 
year's Increases were ·significantly 
smaller" than In previous years, the 
College Board found that student-
aid growth is still not improving 
enough to reduce students' reli-
ance on loans. 

Last year, the College Board 
reported that finanCial support 
numbered almost $129 billion in 
federal, state and campus-based 
student aid. In addition, private 
sources provided $14 billion in 
loans nationally in 2004·05. Even 
though student aid has increased 
dramatically since last year, it still 
grows at a slower rate than tuition 
and fees, the College Board report-

'Koala TV airs new 
pornography segment 

As a part of his ·Koala TV" 
segment on UCSD's Student-Run 
TeleVISion, John Muir College 
senior Steve York aired a 30-mlnute 
broadcast containing sexual activity 
on Od. 20. York's show featured 
sexual content on SRlV last spring, 

prompting the AS. Council to pass 
a resolution condemning his pro-
gram. This year, Commissioner of 
Student Services Maurice Junious 
drafted a proposed addition to 
the SRTV charter that would have 
prohibited "graphic depidions of 
sexual adivlty involving nudity: 
though it was rejeded in a vote by 
the council. 

The council did, however, hold 
an additional council meeting on 
Od. 23, in which multiple coun-
cilmembers addressed concerns 
over York's latest broadcast. 

Academic Senate 
mulls scholarships 
The UCSD Academic Senate 

will once again take up the issue 
of athletic scholarships at its first 
meeting of the year on Od. 25. 

Discussion of the proposal to 
create scholarships to meet NCAA 
Division II standards began last 
spring. but the senate decided 
to table the decision until its 
next meeting. Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson, 
who drafted the proposal, said 
last yea r that adherence to NCAA 
regulation would benefit all UCSD 
students by increasing school pride 
and spirit. 

"In current comparisons, UCSD 
does well in academic categories, 
but not as well as UC Berkeley, 
UCLA and Stanford in student life, 
where sports and academic excel-
lence are combined: he stated in 
the senate's agenda. 

The proposal was met with 
opposition from some campus 
groups, which said the proposal 
was not developed enough to be 
approved. 

"The GSA cannot support this 
proposal until an open dialogue 
occurs and a complete plan is cre-
ated that ensures that the financial 
burden created by student-athlete 
grants-in-aid would not be a bur-
den on other programs," former 
GSA Vice President Laura Kwinn 
stated In the senate's agenda.

End California's partisan Plan goes wrong in 
district boundaries philosophy and execution 

By ALAN KENNY WONC 
Contributing Writer

.\tic r the ccnsu, is taken every 1 U years, 
political districts for legislators arc redrawn

the dominant party in the Legi lature uses

The), twist, shape and bend as me)' so desire 
to create weirdly shaped and noncontiguous 
boundaries for politicians to safely keep rneir 
lebrislative seats or to create more officehold-
ers from mei r own pa rty. 

For example, one would logically expect 
that me San Joaquin Valley City of Fresno 
is one consolidated district; instead, it has 
been partitioned into four districts that skew 
me city'S vote. 

In 2000, the Republi can and Democrdtic 
partie~ in Califomia jointly redrew both 
Mate and federal rlistricts to preserve tile 

~tatu~ quo, taking a W3) ~1 ny electoral unpre-
dictability for the politician,. Con~equently.

" I t \\ .1, it hlpartisan cffim to protcctlllCUnl-

re'pon'>e to me SOL7'(IIIJnIt0 Bee's inquiry of 
the congressional district map approved by 
Republican and Democratic leaders alike in 
September 2001 . I un'es also said he realized 
mat his cru ade to change how districts get 
drawn, which has now been adopted by the 
governor, doesn't nl3~e him popular among 
his colleagues - even those in his own party 
who benefit from the safe seats. 

In the 2004 election, only five' out of 80 
assembly districts and twO our of 39 senate 
district seats were won with less than 55 
percent of the vote. 

Tom DeLay is often bashed by 
Democrats for being responsible for the 
Texas Legislature'S gerrymandering to grow 
me Republican majority in congress that 
knocked off several incumbent Democrats. 
At the same time Democratic politicians in 
California refuse to suppon Proposition 77 
because their majority status allows them to 
gerrymander and preserve the status quo. 

It's a double standard. Ohio Democrats 
are supporting a comparable state mea-
sure that also takes redistricting away. 
from politician$, but they are oppos-
ing such action in California. Why 
don't Democratic politicians suppon 
Proposition 77 in California as well? 
Because in Ohio rney stand to gain 
seats from Republicans with me Ohio 
rcfonn, but in California mel' don't 
want to upset their advantageous . 
status quo - even if it means giv-
ing up their principles. As a staunch 
Democrat, it saddens me mat our 
entrenched politicians are willing 
to give up their values and prin-
ciples to maimain power. 

Gerrymandering takes 
away the electorate's abil-
ity to hold representatives 
accountable: California 
Republic:l n Congressman 
Richard Pombo rccently 
diverted 25 perccm of his 
campaign funds to his wife 
and son (why spend money 
campaigni ng when you're 
going to win anyway?) and 
instead of responding to 
inquiries about this matter, 
his office simply refused to

Proposition '77 , if apprOl'cd, would cre-
ate a panel of thrce retired judge. mat 
would redraw po litica l districts every 10 
years instead of having legislators decide 
their clcctorat<..S themselves. Picked from 
a pool of 24 volunteers selected at random 
by the state Judicial Council, the mree 
judges - at least one Democrat and one 
Republica n - would draw the districts 
without considering voting patterns and 
voter registration figures, and their deci-
sions would have to be unanimous.

Legal insti!lltions control how clIldi-

PROPOSITION 77 
WlLL AMEND THE 

STATE CONSTITUTIO 
TO TRANSFER 

REDISTRlCfING POWER 
FROM THE LEGISLATURE 
TO A PANEL OF THREE 

RETIRED JUDGES. 

ods are flawed to belie'~ ng 
that Proposition 77 is the 
best :1I1d most perfect way 
to fix tllem is a giant leap 
in logic, one that remains 
unsupported. The ballol 
initiative must be judged 
on its merits alone, not on 
me perennial reality that 
politics is always a diny, 
unsavory business. 

The trurn is, a select 
committee of retired judges 
is no more wise or apolitical 
than any other retired politi-
cian. Backers of Proposition 
77 have presented little evi-

dence tha[ retired judges, instead of, say, 
retired teachers. plumbers or bartenders, are 

best positioned to make complicated statis-
tical and geospatial judgments inherent 

in district design. 
As the &m FrMICisco

Proposition 77 would make California elec-
tions more competitive. 

llowevcr, like most of the propaganda 
on both sides of mis issue, mat assertion is 
untrue. The constitutional language of the 
proposal makes no mention of competitil'e-
ness at all, and, in FAct, me initiative's only 
explicit priority is the maximization of con-
tiguity and compactness of districts. 

Drawing borders, in truth, is an inexact 
science. Because many people inherently live 
wirn those most similar to them - skeptics 
should visit Berkeley, on one extreme, or 
Bakersfield, on me orner - preserving geo-
graphic compactness may actually corne at 
me cxpen~ of competitive elections. Then 
there is me issue of empowering minorities: 
Concentrating ethnic groups into majority-
minority districts for poLitical efficacy, seen 
largely as a le!,ritimate redistricting goal, also 
tends to create overwhelmingly Democratic 
districts. Finally, there is d1e question of 
turnout: ince Republican voters tend to 
tum our for elections at slightly greater 
rates than Democrats, creating the perfect!)

Democrats to pos~cs~ a slight majority in

In all of thL'Sc t':.lse .. , rcdi,trlcting require .. 
a trJde-off 111 competing interests, and elect-
ed leaders, nOlunelectcd appointees, showd 
be responsible for detennining how mese 
trade-offs are made. 

For those still unconvinced nbour the 
mllacy of Proposition 77, the 1990 reap-
portionment. presentS an important case 
snldy: t me time, Republican 1:;01'. Pete 
Wilson vetoed the redistricting plan offered 
by the Legislature, sending the matter to 
me Supreme Coun, which was dominated 
by Republ.ican appointees. The Supreme 
Court, in rum, appointed a panel of three 
retired jud ges to oversee a new redistricting 
plan -;- all of mem appointed by Republ.icans 
- who, in rum, hired a Republican strate-
gist to essentially gerrymander disoicts that 
£:wored the party. 

Though Democrats made up 52 percent 
of the voting pubJic, the "nonpartisan" plan 
drawn up by "retired judges" was designed 
to give them only 42 pen:ent of the seats, 
a plan that was inherently political. But by 
the end of the decade, the Democrats had 

. ed large majorities in both legislative f::. showing both the futility of "wise 
planning" that Proposition 77 appears to 
embody, the inherent unceminty of pro-
jecting populations and voter roles a decade 
into the future, and the political nature of 
the judicial system. 

And we know that politics plays just as 
big a role in the current proposal. If authors 
of Proposition 77 were interested only in 
good governance, they would not have 
added a clause into the initiative requiring 
the first redistricting to take place by 2008 
- based on old, outdated data. In attempt-
ing to rush their refonns, the initiative's 
backers show that they're interested in 
instnunental politicaJ gains, not improved 
state government. , 

Creating a commission is simply not 
enough to provide our state with an effective 
electoral -system. Any proposal to overhaw 
our current redistricting system requires the 
state to make qualitative, subjective judg-
ments: Should the plan maximize minor-
ity power, or competitiveness? Should t1ie 
districts simply look competitive, with even 
party splits, or actually be competitive, with 
a sl.ight Democratic advantage? 

All of rnese questions are complicated, 
and require reasoned philosophical answers; 
Proposition 77 offers none, instead punt-
ing the decisions to a group of unelected 
politicos to decide on behalf of the entire 
Slate. That's why voters should oppose the 
initiative on elc:ctioo day.

Denial doesn't help 
ozone depletion 

Dar Editor, 
I would liIce to respond to the let-

ter to the editor (Oct. 17 GwmJiim) 
in which Eleanor Roosevelt College 
&eshman Kanavya Vyas suggests 
that "depletion of the ozone layer is 
not a crisis" and that "envirorunental 
protection is oftentimes exaggerated 
by scien tists.» 

Among other things, Kartavya 
suggests: 

I . Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
are made in insufficient amolll1ts to 
be harmful; 

2. Regulation of CFC produc-
tion is absurd; 

3. "Disappearing ozone is not 
as huge a problem as ~e once 
thought;" 

4. "Decrease in ozone may in fact 
be beneficial toward curing cemin 
diseases;" and 

5. "Human beings are ignorant 
of the facts and only rely on unsup-
ported media stories and wild guess-
es - be it environmentaJ protection 
or U.S. politics.' 

The 1974 Nobel Prize was 
awarded to three scientists in rec-
ognition of rneir ozone research dis-
coveries. Two of them (M. Molina 
and P. Crutzen) are here at UCSD. 
Funher, an international agree-
ment ·(the Montreal Protocol) was 
signed by 146 nations, including the 
United States to stop CFC produc-
tion. Could freshman Vyas know 
more than the Nobel Prize award-
ees, the world scientific col11Jlllll1ity 
and 146 countries? 

Let's examine the facts. 
Worldwide, we humans were pro-

ducing over a million metric tons 
of CFCs per year. CFCs are very 
stable, lasting over 100 years in the 
troposphere. In the stratosphere, 
one CFC can destroy 100,000 ozone 
molecules because CFCs act by a 
free radical chain reaction mecha-
nism. CFCs are responsible for the 
ozone hole over Antarctica (24 mil-
lion square miles), which has only 
one-third of its original ozone. As 
a result, children in Australia must 
by law wear hats and long sleeved 
shirts when outdoors to protect 
them from hannful UV radiation. 
Because of me international agree-
lllent referred [Q above, stratospher-
ic CFC levels have at least begun 
to stabil.ize. Without stratospheric 
ozone, life as we know it cowd nor 
exist on the surface of Earth. Ozone 
in me troposphere (near the surliice of 
Earth) is harmful to life, alrnough 
rtraWspheric ozone is essential As 
Mark Twain said: "Get your facts 
first, then you can distort them as 
much as you pJease."

Kogan: New' 
blood needed 

on student 
committees 

continued {rom />age 5 
turning instead to the usual AS. 
Aur.ilies and cronies. My cell phone 
is prognmuned with the nwnbers 
of most of the people who filled the 
conunittee posts last year - and 
if they think I'm cool enough to 
1lI1k to, they arc certainly not rep-
resenllltive of the regular campus 
population. 

One interesting 1lI1e is the his-
tory of Revelle College senior Jared 
Feldman, whose AS. resume is as 
long as the average A.S. Council 
caucus (an endless, dreary discussion 
that generally has little purpose and 
ends with few actual decisions). After 
'running unsuccessfully for an elect-
ed office in spring 2004, Feldman 
served last year as Pae's chief of 
sllIff. During his tenure, Feldman 
also served as the AS. represenlll-
rive - the proverbial "Average Joe 
student" - to at least three commit-
tees. 11tis year, he's also been llIpped 
by University Centers Director Gary 
R. Ratcliff to chair the powerful 
University Centers Advisory Boord, 
the body that decides how most 
student-funded fucilities operate and 
which eateries secure leases at Price 
Center. UCAB was, ironically, one 
of the few committees Feldman did 
not serve on last year. 

The problem is not Feldman and 
. Khanna - both arc extremely com-
petent and probably the most quali-
fied srudents to fill the spots - but 
the general absence of innovative 
new ideas that is the consequence of 

" If the same students 
run the campus 

year after year, all 
of us suffer from a 
student government 
that abhors change, 

no matter how 
incremental. " 

cronyism. The average AS. appoin-
tee has as much legitimacy repre-
senting UCSD's undergraduate sru-
dent body as the occupation-hand-
pided Iraqi Governing Council had 
in representing the Iraqi population. 
Which is to say, not a whole lot. 

If the same students run the 
campus year after year, all of us 
suffer from a student government 
culture that abhors change, no mat-
ter how increment2l. That may 
explain why the biggest debates on 
the A.S. Council every year seem to 
be about how much money to give 
to MarshalJpalooza at the apense of 
MuirstocIc, and vice versa. 

If students care about cronyism, 
as their grumbling about President 
George W. Bush's most recent 
Supreme Court nominee suggests, 
they should stan doing something 
about it at home. The firststep would 
be for them to actually go to student 
leaders, and demand that they - not 
counci1members and friends - fill 
the important posts. 

Perhaps a regular undergraduate 
would not offer the detailed knowl-
edge and expertise that Feldman 
and Khanna bring to the llIble, but 
.student represenllltives to campus-
wide committees are not appointed 
for their knowledge; they' re there 
to represent the rest of the student 
body, and to shatter the Sllltus quo. 

And for too many years to count, 
the Sllltus quo has been in dire need 
of a kick in the ass.

Theft: Remote parking lots increase crime 
continued (rom page I 

automobiles stolen per capita than 
any other county in the state, he 
said. 

"This campus is open to the 
public 24 hours a day, and that 
lends itself well to thievery," Jones 
said. "One of the last three cars 
stolen entered Mexico within 20 
minutes of being stolen ." 

The campus administration is 
highly responsive to the police 
department's needs and current 
levels of security enforcement 
are adequate, according to Jones. 
However, "in a perfect world" 
there would be more officers 
patrolling campus, he added. 

UCSD currently employs 33 
anned police officers, 13 res iden-
tial security officers and approxi-
mately 40 student community ser-
vice officers to provide escort and 
other security services. 

Security problems on campus 
are exacerbated by parking short-
ages, according to Earl Warren 
College Resident Dean Claire 
Palmer. 

The deficiencies often force 
students to park their cars in 
remote lots and walk back alone to 
the residence halls, she said. The 
issue is especially pronounced at 
Warren, where new buildings and 
accompanying faculty parking 
have nearly eliminated student 
parking in lots adjacent to the 
residence hall s. 

The police department is con-

stantly compiling dalll that will 
help it pinpoint problem areas on 
campus and respond with height-
ened security, according to Jones. 
For example, east campus parking 
lots, located on the east side of 
lnterstate 5, are now monitored by 
security cameras and patrolled by 
plain-clothed officers to accom-

" Once you solve 
the problem in one

modate the growing number of 
students who park there. 

"Once you solve the problem 
in one place, it will come back a 
year later or pop up somewhere 
else," J o nes said. "It's a never-
ending battle to stay ahead of the 
crook." 

Lack of student awareness is 

another factor contributing to 
theft, especially ill the residence 
halls , according to Thurgood 
Marshall College RSO Bill 
Paterakis . 

"Srudents have a false sense of 
security," Paterakis said. "Th ey 
say, 'I'm only going to be gone a 
minute,' and they prop their door 
open, which is all it takes for a 
thief to steal something and run. " 

With only one RSO patrol -
ling each of the six campuses at a 
time, Pateralcis said that officers 
depend on students to immedi -
ately report anything suspicious 
to expedite response times to the 
scene of the crime. 

Instead of relying on RSOs, stu-
dents somtimes direct problems to 
their resident advisers, which wastes 
valuable time and allows thieves to 
escape, Paterakis said. 

The best way to ensure pe r-
sonal security is to simply lock 
up belongings, Jones said. For 
vehicles, students should have a 
cutout switc h installed in th ei r 
cars, involving a hidden button 
that can block the electrical flow 
necessary to start up the engine. 

But the advice is toO little, too 
late for Tam.

said.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 

MONDAY. OCTOBER 24. 2005 

MAHEr. CoN1tNUED nOli PMiE I 
the first university project to be fully paid for 
through private funds in 200J. Come September 
of this year, Chancellor Marye Anne Fox was 
requesting a budget augmentation from the UC 
Board of Regents to the school's construction 
funding. The regents' green light allowed UCSD 
to throw 512.5 million from campus funds into 
the project. 

The Student Center expansion required simi-
larly unonhodox funding, according to acting 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life and 
University Centers Director Gary R. Ratcliff. The 
expansion's first phase, to be completed this winter, 
will construct two buildings containing student 
fucilities such as a Thai reslllurant and the Lesbian 
Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer Intersexual 
Associa tion office. The 55 million project req uired 
University Centers to use its reserves to help fund 
the construction, Ratcliff said. 

"It's safe to say that we don't want to pull from 
our reserve funds anymore for anything having to 
do with construction," Ratcliff said. "lhat money 
can be used for anythjng, but we didn 't plan on 
using it to prop up construction funding. It could 
be going to other things for students, and if we 
don't plan carefully, construction could eat up our 
budget for anything and everything." 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Ratcliff's impression of the market leans 
toward a more uncontrollable force than an 
economic trend, and could very well describe the 
current situation accurately, according to UCSD 
Facilities Design and Construction Director 
Boone Hellmann. 

"In 2002, our project budgets allowed for 
cost escalation in the 2.5 percent range," he said. 
"Since then, the escalation has been extraordinary. 
Last yea r, construction prices 

Barely then: A rise in malket prices led University Centers to dip into reserve funds in order to cnmplete projects like the Student 
Vitlile University Centers' budget aa:ounted for a 2.5-percent mst escalation, last year's construdion price rose by 10 percent 

shot up 10 percent and since 
then it's been an average of 4.5 to 
7 percent in escalation. Each year 
you're short, trying to catch up 
with this market. Build that up, 
and by the time you get to 2005, 
you've effectively lost close to 30 
percent of your buying power." 

Buying power has been the 
Achilles heel for UCSD, which 
no longer has the leverage it had 
a decade ago to attract lucrative 
construction bids, according to 
HeUmann. In a "saturated" San 
Diego construction market, con-
tractors no longer need the work 
provided by large entities such as 
universities, he said. 

"It's a sellers' market in the 
construction arena," Hellmann 
said. "They don't need the work 
that we put up for bid, so they 
don't give us competitively low 
prices. The planets are aligned to 
make it very costly for us to build 
anything, and contractors are'try-

If you want money for 
college, just say no 

.,ALEXANDRA 
mA1FOLD-YOUNG 

Contributing Writer 

re you dependent on financial 
aid to complete your educa-
'on here at UCSD? Then 

don't get caught with drugs. Under 
the 1998 revision law to the Higher 
Education Act, college education for 
students who are convicted of drug 
use and are dependent on federal aid 
will quickly become unaffordable. 

A question box on the Free 
Application for Federal Student 
Aid (FAFSA) asks students if they 
have ever been convicted of a drug 
crime. [f an applicant answers "yes," 
then this little-publicized federal law 
delivers serious consequences. 

The law affects students who 
have been affiliated with drugs in 
any way, from possession, use and 
sale to being in the car with someone 
who was caught with drugs. 

Marisa Garcia, 24, a tudent at 
Cal State Fullerton, experienced 
such consequences firsthand five 
years ago. Garcia used to smoke 
marijuana occasionally, for her 
migraines, but when police found a 
pipe in her car, she had no marijuana 
on her and had completely forgotten 
that the pipe was there. 

"The pipe they found was not 
in plain view," Garcia said. "I had it 
put away somewhere, in a bag in the 
glove compartment, behind stuff." 

The police ticketed Garcia and 
let her go. She went to court one 
month later, pleaded guilty, and paid 
a $415 fine. 

One month after her court date,

Garcia was deemed ineligible for 
financial aid due to her drug convic-
tion. With a minimum-wage, part-
time job that was not enough to 
cover tuition, Garcia worried that 
she would have to drop out of school. 
Her mother, however, supported her 
and paid for books. 

"I had no idea how it was going 
to affi:ct me, " she said. 

Through the academic years 
2001-02 and 2003-04, about 20,000 
students who were convicted of drug 
use were denied Pell Grants and 
30,()()()...4(),OOO students were unable 
to obtain student loans, according to 
a repon released by the Government 
Accountability Office last September. 
The report investigated the effectS 
of the revision on those denied fed-
eral aid, such as food stamps, public 
housing and financial aid for college 
students. 

UCSD Financial Aid Director 
Vincent DeAnda has no choice but 
to accept the law, but he and his 
staff have long tried to have the law 
amended. 

"I've always thought diat was a 
stupid law," D.:Anda said. "It doesn't 
belong on a financial aid application. 
We were very disappointed with that 
law geTting in there and it's created a 
problem with students." 

The law dictates that any student 
convicted once of possession loses 
6nancial aid for one year. If they 
are convicted twice, it extends to 
two years, and the third conviction 
causes them to 10 e their financial 
aid indefinitely.

MONDAY. OCTOBER 24, 2005 

' D~ugs: Convicted students 
stripped of financial support 

cominu£d from page 10 
Democrats have attempted to 

repeal the Higher Education Act 
revision several times, but it is sup-
ported by Republicans and a small 
group of Democrats. They believe 
that if a student wants to use federal 
dollars to complete their education, 
then they should follow the law, 
and the limited pool of financial 
aid should go to students who don't 
use drugs. Moderates have suggested 
softening the law so that it only 
denies financial aid to students with 

, drug convictions that occurred while 
aCtually enrolled in college. 

Garcia, however, disagrees. 
"The guy who wrote the law 

says it tries to help people with drug 
problems," she said. "J've lived with 
this law for so long . .. but I really 
don't see how taking away someone's 
access to education is helpful in any 
way - not to themselves, to their 
/iunily or to society in general." 

She noted that the law is also 
unfair to people who may be trying 
to tum their life around. 

"rtne law] includes addictS who 
have been clean for years, trying to 
better their lives, and want to go to 
college, but they're being told that 
they're not good enough," Garcia 
said. 

DeAnda said that past mistakes 
shouldn't matter. 

"What you 've done in the past 
shouldn't matter if you've gotten 
into the university," he said. "To get 
into this school, you have to have a 
4.0. You did the work, you got the 
grades, you did the SATs. What dif-
ference does it make?" 

He added that the law mainly 
focuses on drug crimes and not any 
other sort offederal offense. It is the 
only question related to crimes on 
the FAFSA. 

According to DeAnda, the law is 

especially unfair because it targets 
students who depend on financial aid 
to pay for college. 

"That's the whole problem: It 
discriminates against a group of 
needy students," he said. 

Dependent students are out of 
luck unless they complete a drug 
treatment program, which must be 
approved by the secretary of educa-
tion and can cost more than a semes-
ter at a public university. 

Garcia said that she looked into 
rehabilitation programs as a means 
of getting her aid back sooner. Sh.e 
was not using any other drug, and tS 
completely clean now. However, the 
least expensive programs still cost 
more than a semester at Cal State 
Fullerton. They were six-month, 
live-in programs, and the only way 
Garcia would have qualified for any 
aid is if she'd quit her job. 

"( opted against that," Garcia 
said. "I figured ifJ was going to be 
paying for something, I was going to 
be paying for schooJ." 

Garcia is currently majoring ill 
sociology and wants to work in the 
drug policy field. She is founder 
and president of the Cal State 
Fullerton chapter of the Students 
for ensible Drug Policy, an orga-
nization currently involved in the 
Removing Impediments to Students' 
Education Act (R.I.S.E.). Currently 
under debate in Congress, the act is 
the result of a natiQnwide effort to 
eliminate the paragraph from the 
Higher Education Act that denies 
students financial aid if they have ·a 
drug conviction. 

"It's just a matter of time before 
we get it changed," Garcia said. 
"We've made so much progress, 
[have] many organizations to back 
it up, [and there are] so many politi-
cians supporting us. Everyone who 
looks at it sees the flaws in it."

"We weren 't prepared and over-

Carpenter. "We work our butts off

The Tritons have had meir fair 
share of cirdma this season , with five 
of meir matches lasting five !,rames. 

CSD was victorious in its first 
four five-game matches; however, 
the Seawolves cnded their srrcak and 
handed the Triton. the loss with a 
7- 15 win in the fifth game.

Soccer: Tritons to face CSUSB, CSULA 
continued from page 16 

fifth goal of the season knotted the 
matchup and gave the Tritons hope 
foj- a huge win over a CCAA rival. 
The game remained even until the 
Toros tallied the game-winner in 
the 83rd minute on ~ goal /rom Kei 
Kamara, his 12th of the year. Taro 
freshman ,forward Nid Ripetto set 
up the score with a long pass to 
Kamara, who netted the goal with 
UCSD senior goalkeeper Edward 
Ruhland caught out of position. 
, :The score gave the Taros the 
lead~e they did not squander, and 
handed the Tritons their first home 
loss of the year. 

TIle loss nsarranges the CCAA 
South Division standings, as UCSD 
and Cal State Dominguez Hills are 
the · top two teams in the division. 
Coming into the game, UCSD 
owned first place. Ilowever, the loss 
bumps the Taros up to a one-point 
lead over the Tritons. 

The Triton have two games 
remaining to retake first place. 
Their first chance will come in San 
Bernardino, Calif., against Cal State 
San Bernardino on Oct. 26. From 
there, the Tritons will return home 
for one last opportunity against Cal 

tate Los Angeles on Oct. 29. 

Greg Dale/Guardian 
JosIIer: Senior Matt Davey fends off a a CSU Dominguez Hills player in the Tritons' 
loss against the Toros. The loss dropped the Tritons into second in the (eM South. 

Joe: White Sox destined to· win after fluke 
continued from page 16 

stage. This team was supposed to 
be dead more times than Jason, but 
is still fighting. And yet ... it won't 
beat the White Sox. 

The White Sox have already 
conquered their curse. The team 
has faced pressure, expectations and 
lack of respect and has triumphed 
over them all Playing in a divi-
sion where the Minnesota Twins 
were again expected to win an4 
the young Cleveland Indians were 
looking to improve eln their run 
late last season, it was the C hicago 
White Sox that sprinted out of the 
gates to a huge divisional advantage. 
Then, as the season neared the end, 
the Lndians again made a charge, 
pressuring the White SOK, which, 

contrary to popular belief, didn't 
play horribly in the second half, but 
were victims of the Indians' stretch 
run. Unfortunately for Cleveland, 
the stretch run didn't exactly last. 
Instead, a routine Oy ball into cen-
ter that was dropped by Grady 
Sizemore was actually the tip of 
the crushing iceberg that would 

. eliminate the Indians and allow the 
White Sox to move on. 

I'm not going to rely simply 
on destiny in making this predic-
tion. T he makeup of the two teams 
themselves helps to reinforce a 
White Sox win. While the Astros 
have great pitching, the White Sox 
are deeper, both with starters and 
in the bullpen. Though the' White 
Sox aren't the best hitting team in 

the league, with their mix of power 
(Paul Konerko) and speed (Scott 
Podsednik), they hold an advan-
uge against the largely powerless 
Astros. While Lance Berkman can 
hit a dinger here or there, if nobody 
else is getting on base or making 
anything happen, the Sox can sim-
ply give him the Bonds treaonent 
and walk him every time he 's up. 

In the end, destiny won't make 
Houston a pushover. Both teams 
have never-say-die attitudes, and 
each game will be close and con-
tested. The problem is that in 
the World Series, even if neither 
team says die, one ultimately will. 
Houston, you have a problem: the 
Chicago White Sox. 

Joe goes with: White Sox in 6.

M ONDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Division: Two games left in Tritons' season 
continued from page ,6 

goalie Mia Shirley, who has been 
spectacular so far this year, made 
a rare mistake and let a low ball to 
the right get through to the net. 

Shirley'S slip gave the Taros 
a 1-0 lead, but the Tritons were 
able to notch an equalizer in the 
67th minute. Sophomore Chelsey 
Campbell's shot from 25 yards 
out bounced off the right post to 
junior Kelly Cochran, who took 
the rebound and netted her eighth 
goal of the season from the left 
side. 

Following the Triton goal, the 
Toros started mounting momen-
tum by putting pressure on the 
defense. Cal State Dominguez 
Hills kept the ball in Triton ter-
ritory for most of the rest of the 
game, eventually taking advantage 
of a tired defense for the go-ahead 
goal in the 86th minute. 

Senff was once again responsi-
ble for the score, but this time she 
went to the opposite side, putting 
the ball in the upper right cor-
ner of the net from 22 yards out 
for the lead . The lead proved to 
be insurmountable, as the Tritons 
hoped for some last-second hero-
ics. However, Senff remained the 
hero of the game and the Toros 
went on to win. 

The loss hurts the Tritons for 
obvious reasons, but their playoff 
hopes are sa fe . T he Tritons are sti ll 
in first place in the CCAA South, 
leading Ca l State Dominguez Hills 
by four pain ts. With the lead, 
the Tritons must win only one of 
their remaining twO regular season 
games to clinch their sixth-straight 
CCAA South Division title. 

The remaining two games for 
the team include a road rematch 
against Ca l State San Bernardino 
on Oct. 26 and a home finale 
versus Ca l State Los Angeles on 
Oct. 29. 

Greg Dale/Guardian 

Flippin' MHt Junior KeI~ Cochran enjoyed a piggyback ride from a Toro and scored 
the Tritons lone goal in UCSD's 2·1 loss to cal State Dominguez Hills on Oct 22.

Tritons fall from first place 
By RAEL ENlEEN 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
dropped its game against Cal State 
Dominguez I Lills and with the 2-
I heartbreaker, 10 t its first-place 
standing in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association South Division. 

The No. 20 Tritons (10-4- 1 
overall, 7-4-1 CCAA) came into the 
game in first place, but could not 
come back after the Toros scored a 
tie-breaking goal in the 83rd min-
ute. 

The Toros began the game by 
hurting themselves, when mid fielder 
Jesse Graliam received a yellow card 
after arguing with the official. Later, 
Graham tackled a Triton hard, earn-
ing him a second yellow card, which 
lead to a red card and his ejection 
from the game. 

The Toros were not slowed by 
the 10 s of a player. Just four min-
utes after the ejection, Cal State 
Dominguez Ilills' Sammy Rivas 
corner-kicked the ball to Cannelo 
Terranova, who scored his fourth 
goal of the year to give the Toros 
a one-goal advantage.Terranova's 
goal was dle last highlight before 
halftime, when CSD reworked its 
game plan and came out firing in 
the second half. T he Triton offense 
brought out their big guns, popping 
off II shots in the second half, COI11-
pared to the T oros' four. 

However, only one of their II 
hots was a success, as their I ne goal 

came in the 57th minute, when fresh-
man Tom Caplan' pass found senior 
Grant ishio for a header that beat 
Toro goalie Kyle Polak. ishio's

Water polo still winless vs. 
Bruins in program history 

IyANGIEUN 
Associate Sports Editor 

After a successful nine-game win-
ning streak from Sep. 18 through 
Oct. 15, the No. 6 UCSD men's 
water polo hit a rough patch on the 
road against some of the top-ranked 
schools in the nation, decreasing the 
team's overall record to 20-6. The 
Tritons &ced No.4 UCLA on Oct. 
21 in the second game of their two-
game road trip to Los Angeles, one 
of the most anticipated games of the 
season. 

The Tritons held the lead for the 
first three quarters of the match but 
were unable to close the game for 
the win in the end. Senior Jonathan 
Hopkins scored first, but the Bruins 
answered with a tying goal with a 
minute left in the first quarter. 

The Tritons started strong in 
the second quarter with senior 
Brandon Borso netting a goal at the 
6 minute, 25 second mark, and four 
minutes later sophomore Adnan 
Jerkovic made another goal, making 
the score 3-1. Refusing to be left 
behind, UCLA added another tally 
to their mark but Hopkins extended 
the Tritons' lead, adding another 
goal with 45 seconds left in the quar-
ter. Unfortunately, the Bruins pulled 
within one goal with the last posses-
sion of the quarter, making the score 
4-3 before the buzzer sounded. 

Each team scored a goal apiece in 
the third quarter, but it wasn't until 
the fourth quarter that the Bruins 
secured the win. UCLA opened the 
fourth quarter by netting a goal with 
6:24 left in the match to tie it up 
at 5-5. The Bruins' captain, David 

Pietsch, then scored the winning 
goal of the game with five minutes 
remaining in the match. 

The Tritons had one last seoring 
opportunity with 19 seconds left; 
unfortunately, the team was unable 
to convert their last break when 
senior goalkeeper Colin McElroy's 
pass was intercepted by the Bruins' 
Thomas Foley. 

The game was marked by 13 
combined ejections between the two 
teams, as the Bruins extended their 
all-time winning streak against the 
Tritons to 43. 

On Oct. 20, the day before, the 
Tritons faced No. 5 Pepperdine for a 
rematch of a disappointing 12-7 1055 
only four days earlier. The Tritons 
found themselves in the hole 1-3 at 
the start, but came back for the tie 
with Hopkins scoring two goals at 
the end of the first quarter. 

Pepperdine came out strong in 
the second quarter netting three 
goals, leaving dIe Tritons behind 
3-6, but seniors Chris Eichholz and 
Chris Finegold scored baclc-to-back 
goals to put the Tritons back into 
the match 3-5 by the end of the 
first half: 

The Tritons were never able 
to take the lead in the match; the 
men were outscored 2-3 in the third 
quarter and the two teams ended the 
match with two goals apiece, mak-
ing the final score 9- 11 in &vor of 
Pepperdine. 

T he Tritons will have the chance 
to recuperate with a week's rest 
before they face No.7 UC Irvine on 
Oct. 28 for the second time this sea-
son and No. 11 Loyola Marymount 
University on Oct. 29.

I began to write this article prior to the start of game one of the World Series. I knew the acnla l 
article wouldn 't be published unti l 
after game two, but wanted to get it 
done and ',Hitten before the series 

~tarted 0 [ could completely enjoy 
it as a fan, not thinking of how to 
stack up the two pitching staffs 
against one another, how to explai n 
Ozzie Gu illen's "smart ball" phi-
losophy or how to write an article 
ana lyzing a World Series [ didn't 
see coming. That article was going 
to match up the two teams, draw 
it out and conclude that this series 
could go ei ther way. 

I deleted that article. I deleted it 
because it was full of indecisiveness, 
contradictions and numerous allu-
sions to "Spinal Tap." I knew the 
article I had to write, the story that 
would encompass this entire World 
Series. This is a series of drought. 
T he Houston Astros had never 
reached a World Series before. The 
White Sox haven't been there since 
1959. No matter how the games are 
played, how many times Guillen is 
ca lled a managerial genius, or how 
many times we have to hear Elton 
John's "Rocket Man" every game 
Roger Clemens pitches, the story 
of the series will be one team fol-
lowing the Boston Red Sox and 
"ending the curse." 

The White SOli have suffered 

from the curse of tht! Black Sox, 
which actually wasn't the Sox's old 
name, but instead the name given to 
me 1919 White Sox team that was 
accused of, cleared of and banned 
for throwing the 1919 World Series. 
I'm not really sure what has cursed 
the Astros, so I'll make the assump-
tion that they suffer from the curse 
of terrible humidity. This whole 
series could be viewed as a curse-
cleansing for both teams, but in my 
eyes, the curse has most definitely 
ended for one of these teams. 

The idea of the Astros winning 
me World Series, giving Clemens 
a chance to go out on top, sounds 
epic. T his team was supposed to be 
stunned and defeated by a two-out, 
ninth-inning home run by Albert 
Pujols in game 5 of the National 
League Championship Series. 
Instead, the Astros persevered and 
won the next game, ending all the 
perceived drama. Their pitching 
staff is stellar, and their home-field 
record is indicative of the advan-
tage that the unique dome provides. 
In Clemens and Andy Pettite, the 
team has legitimate World Series 
experience, and in "The Killer B's" 
- Lance Berkman, Craig Biggio 
and Jeff Bagwell - the team has 
calming veteran leadership. The 
offense, struggles mightily, but 
it proved enough to get past the 
pitching presence of John Smoltz 
and Tim Hudson in the Division 
Series and to beat the best offen-
sive team in the league during the 
Championship Series. The Astros 
came from 15 games under .500 
during the regular season and made 
it aU the way to baseball's greatest

Just over a week ago, the 
women's soccer team was riding 
a nine-game winning streak and 
was prepared to enter the home 
stretch of the regular season with 
only one loss on the yea r. ow, 
me Tritons have tripled their loss 
count by dropping two games in 
a row, both by a sco re of 2-1 to 
Cal State Stanislaus on Oct. 16 
and Cal Srate Dominguez Hills 
on Oct. 22. 

The No. II Tritons (13-3-
o overall, 9-3-3 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association) 
played host to the No. 10 Toros 
(12-4-2 overall, 7-3-2 CCAA) in 
their penultimate home match of 
the year. The Tritons entered the 
game in first place in the CCAA 
South Division with a spot in the 
CCAA playoffs secured. 

Although the Tritons are still 
poised for a playoff appearance, 
their play of late has been less 
than stellar. During their win-
ning streak, the Triton defense 
tallied six-straight shutouts while 
the offense notched 25 goals; 
however, during their two-game 
losing streak, the Tritons have 
allowed four goals while scoring 
only two. 

The defense, normally rem-
iniscent of a brick wall , came 
crumbling down in the 40th min-
ute of the first half against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, allow-
ing the Toros' Tara Senff's sixth 
goal of the year. Triton freshman
