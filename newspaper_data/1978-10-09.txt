Vice-Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage has 
placed a temporary mora -
torium on the approval of all 
new social fraternities and 
sororities until the potential 
impact of these groups on the 
campus and community can be 
studied. 

The growth of these groups 
has caused concern among 
some members of the Uni-
versity administration, leading 
to the moratorium.

years ago in this country, they 
had not been recognized as

until last year. 

Armitage , who recently 
came here from Ohio State, 
says he has an open mind 
regarding the Greek system. 
" At Ohio State' 3,000 students 
were involved in fraternities 
and sororities and it worked 
quite smoothly. They don 't 
operate that well everywhere. 
Why haven 't these groups

Anti-Abortion Students 

'Pro-Life' Forms 
By Tel"fta Tokar 

"Human Life is the con-
tinuum from conception to 
natural death. We're tryin, to 
eradicate abortion, as well all 
passive and active eutha-
nasia," said Sue Smeltzer, a 
member of the newly-formed 
California Student Pro-Life 
Coalition. 

The Coalition was formed in 
San Diego (last August) at a 
conference called by three San 
Diego Pro-Life orlanizations: 
the San Diego State University 
Students in Defense of Life, the 
UDiversity of San Dielo Com-
mittee for Human Life Educa-
tion and the Human Life 
Committee of the. University of 
California, San Diego. Parti-
cipants in the Coalition Con-
ference, which included stu-
dents from 11 California 
universities agreed to hold 
statewide conferences twice 
annually and establish a 
communications network be-
tween campus Pro-Life lfOuPS. 

Acconllnl to Smeltzer, the 
California Student Pro-Life 
Coalition is "mainly concem4!d 
about abortion sa a civil ripts 
iuue. The abortion mentality 
states that a person must meet 
up to certain standards in order 
to be allowed to live; theIe 

-standards bein, • wanted', 
physically or mentally perfect. 
We feel that they're unfair. I 
don't feel that abortion is a 
humane solution to human 
problems. " 

Smeltzer, who ia president of 
Students in Defense of Life, has 
rheumatoid arthritis and the 
vice-president is legally blind. 
In an age when most fetuses 
who are predicted to be born 
with such ailments are aborted, 
Smeltzer stated, "none of us 
wish that we had never been 
born. We don't believe that 
handicapped people have a 
lesser quality of life, as some 
would have you believe." 

Coalition members are also 
concerned about the use of 
abortion as a form of genocide. 
A t a previous Coalition con-
ference, Jose Granda, a colle,e 
student from Los Angeles, 
spoke of the -Los Angeles 
abortion clinics channelin, 
their attention towards the 
Chicano community. Many 
minority leaders, including the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, feel that 
abortion is a form of genocide, 
as many upper-class whites 
advocate abortion for poor 
minorities. 

A prepant woman who, for 
some reason, cannot or does not 
want to keep her child, and does 
not want to have an abortion 
can call the San Diego Pro-Life 
League at 583-LIFE. This is a 
24-hour pregnancy hotline 
staffed by women operators. A 
woman who chooses not to 
abort her child can be given 
free hou~ing and medical care 
if necessary.

Library Harassment: 
A Hidden Problem 

By Dorothy Houston 
Staff Writer 

Try this: mention to women students at UCSD 
that you are doing a report on male harassment 
of female students here. 

The recounting of incidents will come out. 
~ither a woman will tell you she has been 
harassed, or she will tell you of a friend who has 
been haras ed. 

You will begin to realize it occurs a lot more 
often than you thought. 

Last year Jan was watched by a man in his 
thirties every time she studied at Central 
Library. Finally, crying, she called the pOlice. 
The man left the library before the police came. 

Jan returned to UCSD this fall . On Jan's first 
visit to, Central this fall a 60-year-old sat and 
stared at her. She moved to the other side of the 
floor . Five minutes later she looked up to see the 
same man from last year watching her. She left 
the IibraP)'. She felt her right to use the library 
had been violated. 

Sally was on the Muir campus. A man walked 
up to her and exposed himself. 

Linda was in a stall in a gym restroom. A man 
peered at her through the crack in the stall . "I'm 
gonna scream, you'd better get the hell out of 
here," she said. Fortunately, he left. 

By police usage, male harassment of females 
refers to staring, looking up dresses, talking to 

the women or following them. Since 1973, 42 
cases of male harassment have been reported 
on campus. UCSD Police Sergeant Clark Martin 
said this statistic is a reflection of the problem in 
the community. 

Cases of indecent exposure are reeorded 
under • 'miscellaneous crimes against persons." 
Martin said reports of indecent exposure since 
1973 alone could be somewhat higher than the 
figure for male harassment. 

About 75% of the harassers are non-students 
and are of all types, said Martin. 

The two areas where most reports arise are 
the Central Library where, according to Martin, 
about half of the cases originate, and the gym. 
Of those reported from the library two-thirds of 
the cases occurred inside the library, Martin 
guesses. 

The harassment statistics then translate to 
about four reports a year from Central. Added to 
that would be cases of indecent exposure at the 
library. 

"If there were more of a problem at Central, 
Martin said, "I'd post a guard to patrol there." 
There is not enough manpower now .to post a 
guard, Martin explained . Most of the 
department energy goes to theft, the major 
problem, he added. 

"There are many people and employees 
around, you usually can't find a secluded place

in the Hi&b Sierra. 

To IJ'Up tile environmental 
and other effects which the 
development might have on 
nei,hborin, rural commun-
ities, Harold A. Berliner new to 
Orlando, Florida for a close 
look at the 44-acre Disney 
World, completed ten years 
a,o. What he found sent him 
speeding back to California to 
write, print and distribute - at 
!)is own expense - a study 
entitled "The Real Magic in the 
Magic Kingdom - Disney 
World's Own Local Govern-
ment." 
(Becky O'Malley is an attorney 
and an associate editor of 
Pacific News Service.) 

What disturbed Berliner was 
not the environmental or social 
impacts of Disney World but 
that the resort's fantastic 
success came in large part 
because it had managed to 
create its very own government 
- an entity which has taxing 

powers and is exempt (rom

converted a simple draina,e 
district to an improvement 
district with expansive powers 
- The Reedy Creek Improve-
ment District. 

"Bebind tbe modest title 
'Reedy Creek Improvement 
District,' .. said Berliner, 
"hides one of the most powerful 
governmental units this side oC 
the Iron Curtain which is 
governed solely at the pleasure 
of Disney." 

The boundaries of the Reedy 
Creek Improvement District 
happens to coincide with the 44 
acres purchased by Disney and 
Disney associates. The district 
is governed by a board com-
posed of five supervisors , 
elected by landowners who get 
one vote for each acre of land 
owned. 

"Disney's almost complete 
ownership of tbe land gives 
Disney complete control of the

The law also makes it a

about violating them - "to

structure for maney world -

Copies of the Berliner study 
have now been distributed to a 
variety of environmental 
activists in California in an 
effort to head off any similar 
attempts to divert state and 
local law in Sierra County, 
where Disney wants to build its 
Independence Lake resort. 

In Berliner's view, what is at 
stake now is the sanctity of the 
law itself. "What I saw in 
Florida." he said, "convinced 
me that it is Disney's ideas 
about government that are the 
read iSlue facing California. 
What is at stake here is whether 
or not we can maintain the rule 
of law in small, rural counties 
faced with a huge corporation. 
If Disney is able to intimidate 
the state of California and 
Sierra County into ignoring the 
legally established procedures, 
Disney will become the ef-
fective government of Sierra 
County. " 

Palestinians Spurn 
Camp David Accords 

JERUSALEM (AP) - The framework for a Mideast peace 
worked out at Camp David is running into serious trouble in the 
Israeli-occupied territories slated to become an autonomous 
Palestinian enclave under the accords. 

The Palestinians do not seem to be interested in the limited 
autonomy offered by the agreements. fearing self-rule with a 
continued Israeli military presence will kill hopes for 
independence. 

THE GUARDIAN 
The vehement rejection in the West Bank of the Jordan River 

and the Gaza Strip has surprised many Israelis, who thought the 
Palestinians would be happy to see an end to 11 years of IsraeU 
military. government and the establishment of a local 
administration. 
Suspicions are widespread in Israel that the autonomy plan may 
plant the seed of a future independent Palestinian state, and 
Israelis are puzzled that the local Palestinians don't Coresee the 
same result and accept. the accords as a step in that direction.

The problem now seems so acute that Egyptian-Israeli 
negotiators, scheduled to meet Thursday in Washington to begin 
working on a bilateral peace treaty, also are likely to focus on the 
Palestinian issue, Israeli officials say. 

The recognized leadership in the West Baok-mostly mayors 
and town councilmen elected two years ago-is campaigning hard 
against the accords to bring the occupied areas firmly into line 
with the "rejectionist camp" in the Arab world-Syria , Iraq, 
Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization. 

"We want these agreements to fail," says Mohammed Milham, 
mayor or Halhoul, 13 miles south of Jerusalem. "Autonomy will 
lead us nowhere." 

Milham and others are calling for a boycott of the elections and 
are urging moderates not to run.

the Moscow trip would produce 
a treaty ready for the signa-
tures of President Carter and 
Soviet President Leonid I. 
Brezhnev. 

The deal also would allow 
both sides to go forward with

controller of aU .S. Navy double 
agent in a plot to (unnel anti-

fund-raiser, to keep the issues 
alive - virtually without help 
from established political 
figures. 

Petition campaigns fueled by 
direct-mail contributions have 
placed both issues on the Nov. 7 
ballot - Proposition 6, aimed at 
firing homosexual teachers 
and, in some cases, their 
supporters; and Proposition 7, 
substantially increasing the 
number of convicted murder-
ers who would face execution in 
the gas chamber. 

One other state ballot meas-
ure q~alified by initiative and 
has attracteJ wide attention: 
Proposition 5, which would 
limit smoking to designated 
areas of some public buildings 
and ban it in others . 

The three prominent meas-
ures - 5, 6 and 7 - seem ideally 
suited for initiative campaigns . 

Each arouses intensely 
personal. emotional reactions 
on both sides, feelings that can 
get obscured in legislative 
compromises but are ~alled to 
the surface in ballot measure 
fights. In fact, elements of each 
measure were rejected by the 
Legislature in the last year. 

The vote on Briggs' two 
initiatives also will measure 
the strength of the conservative 
tide in California, widely 
heralded with the nearly 2-1 
passage of Proposition 13 June 
6. 

In his ballot argument for 
PropoSition 6, Briggs portrays 
the vote as almost a referen-
dum on the social ferment of the 
1960s. 

" We see the symptoms of 
moral decay all .around us: 
children hooked on hard drugs, 
sex and violence glorified in the 
mass media. gang wars, casual 
premarital sex among teen-
agers .. .. " the argument reads

spiring to use Lt. Cmdf: Arthur 
Lindberg to obtain vital defense 
secrets. 

Keary-Taylor said he heard 
Enger's voice on three record-
ed conversations involving 
exchanges of information and 
ml)ney along New Jersy high-
ways. Defense attorneys say 
testimony has not proved that 
Enger speaks English, the 
language uses in the recorded 
Instructions. 

The FBI agent said both 
English and Russian were 
spoken to tell constitutional 
rights to Enger and another 
suspect. Vladimir Zinyakin, 
former third secretary of the 
Soviet mission to the United 
Nations . 

The officials. who asked to 
remain anonymous, said cru-
cial issues that tentatively have 
been resolved involve the 
Soviet Backfire bomber and 
development of new land-based 
intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile.$. 

Secretary of State Cyrus R . 
Vance and Paul C. Warnke , 
chief U.S. arms negotiator, are 
to fly to Moscow soon to work 
out details of the final agree-
ment. 

For Warnke, who Thursday 
night said he plans to leave his 
post "in the very near future." 
the trip could be one of his last 
official missions involving the 
long-sought SALT accord. 

OfCicials noted that even if 
Vance and Warnke were suc-
cessful in Moscow on working 
out the final details it would 
take at least one month more to 
prepare for a summit meeting 
between Carter and Brezhnev. 

And the officials said the 
apparent agreement reached 
during talks here last weekend 
between Soviet Foreign Minis-
ter Andrei A. Gromyko, Vance 
and Carter still could come 
unraveled if Gromyko finds 
objections at home to the 
negotiating steps he took. The 
final version of the treaty also is 
sure to face opposition when 
submitted to the U.S. Senate for 
ratification.

Rhodesia to 
End Policy of 
Segregation 

SALISBURY. Rhodesia (AP) 
- Rhodesia 's biracial transi -
tion government plans to 
announce the abolition of all 
remaining racial segregation 
laws this week , published 
reports said Sunday, 

The reports here said Ernest 
BLulle, black ro-m1-nJSter of 
justice, made the announce-
ment at a political rally 
Saturday. 

Rhodesian Prime Minister 
Ian Smith and the Rev . Ndaba-
ningi Sithole, one of the three 
moderate blacks on the ruling 
executive council , currently 
are in the United States trying 
to drum up support for the 
transition government. 

Bulle was quoted as saying 
the timing of his announcement 
was coincidental and was not 
designed to head off embar-
rassing questions in the United 
States about Rhodesia's tardi -
ness in dropping segregationist 
laws. 

Although race laws here have 
been much less stringent than 
in neighboring South Africa , 
Rhodesia was formerly divided 
into a patchwork of roughly 
equal-size areas for it 260.000 
whites and 6.7 million blacks . 

This week's announcement is 
expected to remove the last 
vestiges of segregation here: 
separate schools , hospitals and 
residential areas for whites and 
blacks. 

In other developments , the 
government said 218 persons 
had been a rrested in connection 
with last month 's order ban-
ning the activities of local 
followers of Rhodesia's two 
nationalist guerrilla move-
ments.

colleges. Many students dis-
play cerlain loyalties to their 
respective colleges. With 
fraternities and sororities on 
campus, will those loyalties 
transfer from the colleges to 
the Greek groups? Another 
question to consider is that the 
groups are looking for housing; 
wbo decides where this housing 
will be located? 

Armitage's cautious 
thoughts regarding fraternities 
and sororities aren't shated by 
other administrators. Chan-
cellor William McElroy says, 
''I'm in favor of fraternities and 

sororities a. long as they have 
broad objectives and aren't 
restrictive in membership. I 
thinlr it 's good for groups who 
have common Interests to get 
to.ether." 

When asked about faculty 
reaction -to Greek Iroups, 
McElroy said, "Concern may 
arise among the faculty if these 
groups display behavior in-
dicative of them in the '308 and 
-408. ,. 

McElroy offers one possible 
solution to the housi. prob-
lems the Greek groups are 
faced with: "I know these 
groups are having a hard time 
locating suitable housing in the 
La Jolla area . They might 
investigate the possibility of 
having their national chapters 
build on campus and in tum 
make a gill of the building to the 
University to be used for the 
purposes specified by them." 

Scott Spicer, former Student 
Organizations Advisor, helped 
two sororities get started last 
year. "I was very impressed 
with all the Greek groups on 
campus because they started 
with minorities and students 
from all incdme levels. Any 
study I've seen shows that 
Greek group members have 
higher than average grade 
point averages and retention 
rates. And the groups aren't all 
social. Most of them provide 
specific community services." 

Currently, two sororities and 
one fraternity are recognized 
by the University as stUdent 
organizations. 

Alpha Omicron Pi, a sorority, 
listed some of its purposes: " To 
encourage a spirit of fraternity 
and love among its members , to 
stand at all times for integrity, 
dignity, scholarship and col~ 
lege loyally, to strive for and 

support the best interests of the 
colleges and universities in 
which chapters are installed 
and in no way to disregard, 
injure or sacrifice those 
interests for the sake of 
prestige or advancement of the 
fraternity or any of its chap-
ters." 

The sorority was started in 
1897 at Barnard College as a 
sodal service group. San Dielo 
alumni from Long Beach 
helped establish the UCSD 
chapter along with 13 girls. In 
November 1977 UCSD became 
an official chapter of Alpha 
Omicron Pi , with 26 members . 

This year, 44 women attended 
the me.mbership week known 
as " Rush." 

President Laura Bloom says 
the only membership require-
ment is that the women be full 
time UCSD students. The

Analyst. Says Families Necessary 
By Doal Campion 

SdeIIeeEtUw 
"The family is an endan-

gered specie., " psychiatrist 
Ralph Greenson warned an 
audience in La Jolla's Sher-
wood Hall Friday evening. 
"But it shall live," he added. 
"It muat live, or we shall all go 

. under." 

Greenson, a professor of 
psychiatry at the UCLA School 
of Medicine, was delivering a 
lecture about .. People in 
Search of a Family, " the first in 
a series of four lecture. on 
" Identity" presented by the 
San Diego Psychoapalytic 
Institute. HI, talk dealt with 
many of tlJe difficulties people 
encounter In "findina a new 
family to replace the old one," a 
search he described as "part of 
growing up." 

Greenson used the term "new 
family" to describe any group 
of friends or acquaintances 

_ with which a person associates 
himself in order to feel some 
sense of belonging. 

As an indi.cation of the 
problems involved with the 
quest for this new family , the 
analyst cited the increase in the 
number of suicides among 
young people. He said that the 
adult rate of suicide bas 
remained constant for nearly 
half a century, while the suicide 
rate amon, teenagers has 
tripled in the last 25 years. 
Greeuon admitted that dnII 
use and rejection from a 

. boyfriend or girlfriend might 
account for some of the deaths. 
However, the major factor 
causina such a rapid rise in the 
suicide rate, he .peculated. is 

~ currenJ trend towJl'd the 
loosening of family bonds. 

"We all need families," said 
Greenson . "We cannot live 
without family life." 

During the 80., people who 
felt rejected and needed a new 
family would sometimes group 
together to form "communes." 
ACCOrding to Greenson, the 
idea was a good one, but often 
failed because the members 
seldom had a common goal to 
unite them and the group rarely 
possessed the variety of. ages 
and personalities usually found 
in a true family. The Israeli 
kabatz seems to come closer to 
fulfilling the need, the psy-
chiatrist said. He also pointed 
to the current popularity of 
some religiou. cults in the 
United States" saying, "The 
Hare Krl'hna and Moonles 
behave as an extended family." 

Teenagers are not the only 
ones In I88reb of a new Jamily, 
thoUlb. Green.on said that 
many t1ma love l"elatioaahips 
and mamales are the result of 
a man', or a woman's deIire to 
once &laiD beloag to a family. 

As an example, be cleacribecl 
the caee of a "Mr. P," who wu 

romantically involved with a mother, father, and brothers. 
woman who often did not show The analyst concluded that this 
up for dates and who, without was probably the main reason 
any concern for Mr. P, dated for his patient's characteriziDi 
several other men. De.pite the . the relationship as a good one: 

-- ----

"one more family " in a retire-
mentcommunity. This , he said , 
stems from the fact that as a 
person grows older, he be-
comes "so afraid to die alone. " 

.. ... the major factor causing such a rapid rise in the suicide rate ... is 
the current_ trend toward the loosening of famil.y bonds," 

woman's multiple romances, 
and ignorina the virtual ab-
eeDce of any sexual activities 
between them, Mr. P coa· 
Un08lly described their rela-
tionship as "good" and inti· . 
mate." 

In the course of the psy-
cboanalysls procedure, Green-
son discovered that often, when 
the woman was out with 
another man, ¥r. P would 
spend the evening with her 

it seemed to fulfill the need to 
belong in a household setting. 

Almost any setting"in which 
people are bound together can 
serve as a sort of family . 
Greenaon said this even applies 
to convicts in a prison. "Many 
people do Dot want to leave 
jail," he said. "When released, 
they will often do something to 
be put back in jail." 

He also pointed out the 
retired person searching for 

Greenson stressed the impor-
tance of communicating hon-
estly within a family. He also 
warned that people have to 
recognize the fact that people 
do change. "These are the 
things that make a family 
work. Otherwise, you're just 
borders," he said. 

When asked why, if the 
family unit is so important, 
analysts are reluctant to use 
group or · family therapy , 

OVERS65QA 
RIGHT 

Greenson responded : " We 
analysts are notoriously con-
servative - that ' s not a 
strength, it's a weakness." He 
explained that new therapies 
take a great deal of time to 
learn and many of the " old-
school" psychiatrists want to 
ensure that the traditional 
methods are not simply dis· 
carded to make way for them. 
He added, " If I were younger, I 
would practice family therapy. 
Yes, I'm a great believer in 
this . But not now, I'm too old ." 

After discussing marriage 
and divorce, living together 
and breaking up, all the good 
and all the problems commonly 
associated with familie s, 
Greenson smiled slightly and 
summarized his findings : 
" Family liCe is good for your 
health . You live longer .... 
Perhaps it only seems longer." 

If you're a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or 
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. 

It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Co~egiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify, 
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through yoUr 
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of qfficer Candidate School, 
you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical 
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school, 
but in the Navy, we pay,you. And at the end of the year of 
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 

I t isn't easy. There ~ fewer than 400 openings and only 
one of every six applicants will be sele.cted. But if you make 
it, you'll have qualified for an elite engineering training 
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 
salaiy in four years, anrl: gilt-edged qualifications for jobs 
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy 
larer. (But we don't think you'll want to.) 

Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a 
Navy·representative when he visits the campus on Oct. 17-18" 
or contact your Navy representative at 293-6444. 
If you prefer, send your resum~ to the Navy Nuclear Officer 
Program, Code 312-B537, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, 
Va. 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly. 
The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help 
you finish college: it can lead to an exciting career opport\Dlity.

starting with women's volley-

TV Reruns: Dodger VS. Yankees 
It is a time for New York and 

Los Angeles haters to rejoice. 
The Yan~ and Dodgers, two 
teams peole love to hate, 
square off tomorrow in Los 

A~ieles at 5: 30 pm for the 75th 
World Series. 

The 1978 World Series is a 
rematch for the Yankees and 
Dodgers. New York defeated 
Los Angeles four games to two 
last year behind the solid 
hitting of Series MVP Reggie 
"Mr. October" Jackson. 

Jackson is a man who knows 
all about love/hate relation-
ships. He is both loved and 

• despised by the baseball fans of 
the country. A man of enor-
mous ego, Jackson turns it on 
when the games are important 
and the TV cameras are rolling. 

The Dodgers will counter

man who enjoys the limelight.

S.D. Bands:· A Local 
Guide From A to Z 

By Beauregard Cretin 
When embarking upon a discussion of the local music scene, I 

find it difficl,llt to objectively evalijate and rate musical groups 
This stems from the realization thatdirrerences in taste fluctuate 
tremendously among individuals and from my own predisposition 
to sympathize with any musicians who have the determination and 
patience to practive long the hard enough to assemble a 
marketable act, Having myself formerly performed 
,professionally both locally and in L.A. I am, however, confident 
that the letter grades assined to the following bands listed should, 
depending on variables of club atmosphere and audience 
receptivity, deviate no more than a plus or minus. 

These ratings are based on imputing to the listener the qualities 
of some knowledge of popular music, a reasonably discerning ear 
and a desire to be entertained.

in the library, .. the sergeant said, 

Yet women interviewed said they feel isolated 
in Central. Some don't come at nipt and don't 
like beiq a lone in the library, Others expresaed ' 
uneaaiDeu at usint the reltrooms alone, 

Martin sal<l the police have had success in 
apprehension because the harasser is often still 
in the area after the report is made, 

The apprehension rate at the gym though, is 
just about zero. "They stand at the shower and 
then they're gone," Martin said, 

TORI Sharp, Circulation Mana,er at Central, 
deleribed Doon .our throuIb seven .. the 
safest, and the fint .s the moat danteroua for 
women, He aclmowledeed that women feeliq 
uneuy about the reItrooms can use the main 
floor restroom, 

Of the 42 harassment cases cited it is 
undetermined how m any of those resulted in 
arrest. When asked, the police did not go 
throueh the records to count, explaining that it 
would be too troublesome. 

Women who are bothered can make a citizen's 
arrest a,ainat 8 harasser. He can be cited fo 
di.trubinl the peace, which is defined as 
inciting to fiiht or production of malicious, loud 
or offensive disturbances, 

Sharp receives one to twO. complaints of 
haraument 3 month. But, "a lot wait on 
reportint or don't report," he said. 

Probably then, harassment statistics, like 
rape statistics, don't renect the actual situation. 
Since 1173 two rapes and one assault to commit 
rape have been recorded on campus, One out of 
ten rapes are reported, it has been purported, 

Looking up a dress or staring is not a crime 
though, explained the sergeant. 

"From my poi nt of view," S harp said, 
"harassment is not a bad problem here - it's 
bad for the person bothered, Most men are 
trying to let looks through exhibitionism and 
don't physica lly attack a woman." The 
harassers aren't discriminating, Sharp said; 
any woman ~uld be bothered , 

A woman involved in a citizen's arrest must 
appear in court if the arrested declares not 
guilty. He has the right to confront her, 

A UCSD Po liceman, Martin said, will 
convince a woman to make a citizen's arrest if 
he feels a crime has been committed. 

"It's very easy," Martin said, "she just has to 
say 'I want that man arrested'." 

One woman said she thought reporting would 
"be a hassle," Some are unsure if a man is 
actually harassing them or not; they think a 
possible harasser could be just staring 
momentarily. 

"We wouldn't have these problems if women 
would report," Sharp'said, adding that since last 
spring an increase in reporting of harassment in 
the library has increased, He feels this could be 
due to more encouragement to report rather 
than to more harassment occurring, 

Women can report and not get involved. 
Martin said. 

Three descriptioDl of a same harasser were 
given to The GaardJaa, yet none of the women 
had reported him. One woman said she didn't 
report such an incident because she felt it 
" wouldn't do, any good." 

"Overall," Martin said, "from the students I 
don't get the idea that harassment is that big of a 
problem here," 

But if women speak up more maybe th,at 
assessment of that situation would ctiange.

Another fraternity, Kappa 

Alpha Psi, is in its first stages of 
development at UCSD. with the 
help of alumni Charles Thom-
as, chairman of the urban and 
rural studies program. Aware 
of the temporary moratorium 
on new Greek groups, Thomas 
says University recognition 
would be nice, but that it's not 
essential. The group will be 
integrated, he says, "remem-
ber, segregated fraternities 
have always been on the other 
side. We will concentrate on 
social service and cultural 
activities. " 

Sharing The Times is 
"friendship, Ufe. The group 
promotes 10 .if-I and University 
involvement and provided 
academic s timulation. Our 
philanthropic int~rest is the 
Arthritis Foundation, we also 
participate in San Diego's 
Special Olympic program." 

Bloom says that Alpha Omi-
cron Pi, referred to as A.O.Pi, 
along with SiJrna Kappa, is 
trying to change the image of 
Greek groups: "I think the 
campus is sensitive toward the 
idea of fraternities and sorori-
ties because of the image they 
present at San Diego State. 
We're trying to make a good 
impression ... 

Membership fees for A.O.Pi 
are $205, which includes one-
time payment for pledging 
activities, initiation ceremony 
and pin, and tbe national 
building fund, and in addition, a 
monthly fee or $15 wbich covers 
the cost of dinners, dances, etc. 

. SiJrna Kappa, another soror-
ity, was created to "Inspire 

. social, academic and com-
munity involvement." It start-
ed in 1847 at Colby College. 
Today it bas nine chapters in 
California. 

An alumni from Fullerton 
helped start the Sigma Kappa 
chapter here that was offi-
cially recognized nationally 
earlier this year. President 
Marcella Wilson explains why 
the group was started here: 
"UCSD is a very competitive 
school geared towards study, 
we were formed as a social 
outlet." 

Now that the sorority is on its 
feet, Wilson recognizes other 
needs the group fulfills. "Sigma 
Kappa broadens a member's 
field of interest. Our philan-
thropy is gerintology. This year 
we will be working with PACE, 
Public Acces Cable TV for and 
by the Elderly. It's received on 
channel 24 . The Communi-
cations department here is 
actively involved in getting it 
started, and we've volunteered 
to help. Some of our members 
will also participate in the 
Adoptive Grandparents pro-
gram, spending time with the 
elderly in the community." 

Wilson says finding a house 
isn't the group's primary 
objective right now. The future, 
she says, is hopeful. "Last year 
people were ready to criticize 
Greek groups on the basis of 
sororities in the '60s. We're 
trying to present a good image. 
A lot of people think sororities 
and fraternities are over-
running the school with parties 
and don't think we're bene-
ficial, but they don't see us 
working in the community or 
helping others with home-
work." 

Sigma Kappa fees include $80 
for initiation and pledging 
events, $14-50 for a pin (de-
pending on the style), and $10 
monthly fo dues. 

Alpha Pili Alpha is the only 
recognized fraternity on cam-
pus. Its purpose is "To en-
courage academic excellence 
among l1!llVersity Clod college 
students. ' I 

The fir. t Of the black fraterni-
ties, it W3~ founded in 1906 on 
the CornEll University campus. 
Today, a .t ough predominant-
ly blad:, it is open to all 
students, regardless of race. 
UCSD participates in the 
metropolitan chapter along 
with San Diego State . Its 
membership consists of 15 men 
who satisfy the membership 
re uirements of full time

BUI Byrd, dean and director 
of special education programs 
at UCSD and eraduate advisor 
to Alpha Phi ~Ipba, says that 
.. Alpha Pbi Alpba bas histor- . 
ically been a black service 
agency rather than a beer 
agency. Martin Luther King 
and other black leaders have 
been part of our group." 

"The benefits are divided 
into two categories, personal 
and professional. Personally, 
your brothers are pledged to 
come to your aid at all times. 
Professionally, you're able to 
meet alumni (doetors,lawyers, 
etc.), who have made it and can 
show the way. Right now we're 
involvM in a nationwide 
fundraiser to get together one 
million dollars to contribute to 
the N.A .. \CP, the Urban League 
al d the United Negro College 
Fund. We also participate in 
programs in the community 
which serve the black com-
munity." 

Toward the end of this month, 
Alpha Phi Alpha will invite 
men they think worthy, who can 
"give us something and we in 
turn can give to them," to a 
banquet to acquaint them with 
the fraternity. District At-
torney for the Northern District 
of Ohio, Jim Williams, will 
speak about the advantages of 
joining the group. 

According to Byrd , the 
fraternity is interested in 
building a house which would 
accommodate 10-15 men; 
hopefully he says this will 
hapen in less than five years. 

Alpha Phi Alpha fees initially 
run under $100. After a mem-
ber's first year, he has input 
into the group's financial 
decisions. 

Membership requires men 
have a 3.0 grade point average. 
Thomas anticipates beginning 
membership won't exceed 15. 

The future of Greek groups is 
encouraging, says Thomas. "I 
think partying emphasis has 
been redefined to cultural and 
political and social needs. 
There's a peed for a cultural life 
here." . 

Apparently there are other 
activer sororities not recog-
nized as student organizations 
here. They include Alpha 
Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma 
Theta and Sigma Gamma Rho.
