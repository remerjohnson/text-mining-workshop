Election Orients Iran's Future Course 
By William Beeman 

Two recent events in Iran 
have rai.ed and partially 
an.wered the question 
hanging over the Iranian 
revolution like a .word since 

William Beeman is a 
Midea.t schQ/ar at Brown 
Uniuersit". He wrote this .tory 
for Pacilic News Service. 
the Ayatollah Khomeini took 
charge more than a year ago: 
What win happen when the old 
patriarch diet? 

Khomeini'. recent heart 
attack and ho.pitalization 
have let the question in sharp 
relief. 

And coincidentally, the 
ejection of AboIhu.an Bani 
Sadr a. Iran'. fir.t freely 
elected president has provided 
an encouraging, if only 
tentative, answer. 

The election provided the 
first opportunity for the Iranian 
people to express their vision 
for the future 01 Iran in a clear 
way. unclouded by the 
immense popularity of 
Khomeini, who stayed out of 
the campaign. 

But in term. of previewing 
the posI·Khomeini future of

may be Ies. enlithtening than

Spirit Competition Wrong, Not Third 
Editor: 

I would like to comment on the article, "Third 
Had Wrong Kind of Spirit," printed in the Feb. 4 

I Daily Guardian. 
First, I'm a Third College student and damn 

proud of it. Third College's enthu.ia.m at the 
UCSD v.. Whittier Jame was directed at 
motivating profession play from our player •. 
Our spirit was inspirational to the victory over 
Whittier. 

The main objective of Spirit Night i. twofold: 
To demon.trate support of the team by UCSD 
and to differentiate between the two col~e.' 
most effective in demonstrating that spirit. Third 
College did not institute the antagonism one 
college feels for another in the wake of defeat. 
Third College performed by the rule. of Spirit 
Night and won. 

A. Jim McKay has said, there i. aJways "the 
thrill of victory and the agony of defeat." I'm 
.orry, Muir, if the agony of defeat i. too much 
for you to bear. I would rather see the 
competition among the colleges eliminated and 
a sense of commUnity and brotherhood put in its 
place. That's one of the reason. I'm attending 
Third College; its sense of community and 
brotherhood allows concern over each person'. 
contribution aa the summation of the whole. 

Ask the players on the team the effect Spirit 
Night might have had on the outcome of the 
game. I'm lUre you'll find your criticism. invalid. 
Until the competitive nature of Spirit Night i. 
changed to allow equal reco~tion of effort, 
Third College will continue to play by the rules of 
the game and enjoy the thrill of victory.

Kuwait News ' Says 
Hostages Free Soon 

IRAN - A Kuwait newspaper reported from Tehran 
yesterday that the release of the Americans held hostage in the 
US Embassy for more than three month. is "imminent." 

The weekly newspaper AI Khodaf said the number of young 
Iranian militants occupying the embassy has been reduced from 
400 to 50, and final arrangements for the relea.e of the 
approximately 50 captive Americans are being completed 
"following the election of Abolhassan Bani Sadr as Iran's new 
president. " 

The paper did not give the source of its information, and there 
was no immediate confirmation of its report from Wa.hington or 
other quarters, although Carter administration officials have 
expressed cautious optimism about the embassy .tandoff in 
recent days. 

"Bani Sadr hal set the settlement of the ho.tage cri.i. and the 
ending of the duality of authority being exerci.ed in Iran a. the 
main objective. at the beginning of hi. term," the report .aid. 

Al Khodaf said UN Secretary.Generai Kurt Waldheim is 
trying to penuade Bani Sadr to "pre .. ure the .tudents to leave 
the embas.y and have them replaced by regular Iranian troops." 

The Kuwaiti press is highly competitive, and the reliability of 
the AI Khodaf report was not known. But the Kuwaiti. have 
good contacts in Iran because of the proximity of the two 
countrie •. There is also a relatively large Iranian community in 
Kuwait. 
. Bani Sadr made plain Wednesday that he was detennined to 
trim the power of the embassy militants. He castigated them for 
getting a government mini.ter arrested, calling them "dictators 
who have created a government within the government," and 
gave the cold shoulder to a US delegation invited to Iran by 
them. 

Immigration authorities detained the 49·member US group 
for four hour. Wednesday night at Tehran airport because they 
had no entry visas, then sent them to' a Tehran hotel. 

The Foreign Ministry issued the group four·day visas today at 
the request of the embassy captors, although the delegation 
planned to .tay 10 days.

Airport' 8 Right 
To Quiet Upheld 

BURBANK - In a case 
which is about to have national 
significance, a Superior Court 
judge ruled today that the 
Glendale·Burbank·Pasadena 
Airport Authority has the right 
to restrict an airline's number 
of flights in order to reduce 
noise. 

Acknowledging that if he 
ruled in favor of the airport 
authority "other agencies 
around the country are going 
to try similar rules," Judge 
Thomas Murphy said the 
airport's noise rule was not 
discriminatory, arbitrary or 
unreasonable. 

But, he said, if he had ruled 
for the airline, or if it prevails 
on appeal, "there won't be an 
air carrier in the United States 
that won't say, "What's .auce 
for them is sauce for us."

marketplace" and promised 
he would "not let it be picked to

Revelle Dean Mort Chairs Committee of 1·1 
. A group of administrators called together by 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard 
Annitage has been charged with organizing a 
draft registration counseling service. 

Chaired by Revelle Dean Ernie Mort, the 
committee includes the four deans, t he directors 
of legal, counseling and psychological services, 
career planning and placement, the 
Coordinator of Religious Affairs and a 
graduate representative, 

Its purpose, Armitage says, is to "make sure 
as the (draft) situation develops that the latest 
and authentic infonnation about options is 
available to students," 

The committee met for the first time 
yesterday, Muir Dean Charles Dreilanger says, 

only to seek student membership from the AS 
and gr aduate council. 

The committee probably won't meet again 
until President Carter has finally established his 
plans on registering men and possibly women 
for the draft, Dreilanger says. 

Armitage has a personal stake in the 
committee, 

His son was a conscientious objector during 
the Vietnam War, but had difficulty obtaining 
that status because he did not declare himself as 
such upon registration. ,. 

"He was lucky because he had made 
statements to the newspapers long before about 
his opposition to the war," Armitage notes. 

He eventually served a year of alternative 
service as an aide in a mental institution. 

Republican candidate 
Ron .. ld Reagan, ali .. 
"bloodbath ReBJan," received 
even more profuse praise. "I 
.... him when he fint took 
office in California, beefing up 
police fore:. all over to crack 
down on diuidents, cracking 
down on marijuana, and

implemented, Iran's future will 
be that of a democratic nation, 
free of influence and 
interference from either of the 
great superpowers - a 
simpler nation with a more 
diversified economy based not 
sok!ly on oil and industrializa-

tion, but increasin~ly on 
agriculture , 

The key to this future rests 
on the extent to which Bani 
Sadr will be able to exercise his 
powers under the shadow of 

. Khomeini 's constitutionally-
sanctioned veto powers, or the 

Leadership Council which will 
succeed . Khomeini after his 
death. The council will be 
appointed, with public 
approval, by a popularly 
elected Assembly of Experts, 
and will retain veto power over 
the President.

Intensity Distinguishes JC 
Transfer on 'the Court 

Assurance Borders on Arrogance 
By Barbara Haas 

Senior Staff Writer 
On the varsity basketball 

team there is an athlete who 
stands out. 

He's not taller or bigger 
than anyone else, so you 
wouldn't necessarily notice 
him in a crowd. It's his style of 
play. 

The Daily Glial'dian 

Sports 
Gary H~ynes, sometimes 

guard, sometimes forward for 
the Triton cagers, plays with 
an intensity and self-assurance 
that borders on arrogance. 
When he's on the court, it fills 
the air like last Wednesday's 
fog, There's no escaping it. 

Haynes, a 24.year·old 

transfer from San Jose City 
College, is in his first year at 
UCSD, He's majoring in 
Drama at Third College. 

Drama? An athlete? 
Haynes explains this unlikely 
choice: "When I was up at San 
Jose I was undecided. But I 
started helping my friend's 
girlfriend with some of her 
lines because she was in ' 
drama, and I got interested," 

"So there was this class you 
could take for four units to help 
set up the stage and do the 
props and stuff, Well, I 
figured, 'hey, four easy units,' 
so I took the class. Then I was 
setting up one time for 
rehearsals and the director 
asked me if I had ever done 
any acting. I came back the 
next day to do a reading and 
wound up with one of the 
biggest parts in Guys & Dolls. 

Due to the time he puts in for 
basketball, Haynes has not

had enough time to seriously 
attempt to follow his major, 
The procedure for auditions 
are different here (applicants 
read an original monologue 
instead of a set script) , but he 
plans to continue in the field if 
he can, 

On the court , Haynes 
seems anything but an 
academic, He drives with 
uncommon intensity, and 
shoots from the outside with 
confidence, His tight defense 
makes it hard for even an 
electron to penetrate. This 
talent has made him cocky -
even he admits that. Perhaps 
his cockiness had a part in 
developing his talent. 

Like other junior college 
transfers, Haynes was forced 
to mold into a different style of 
play. He's had to blend four 
years of high school and junior 
college ball into stiD another 
method. 

At the beginning of the 
season he didn't make the 
transition well and spent the 
early season games on the 
bench. Now, he's adapted to 
the changeover by finding a 
medium suitable to both coach 
Ron Carter's philosophy and 

H~nes' personal style. 
The acclimation has paid 

oH for him and he's been in the 
starting line· up for the past few 
games. He's been instrument· 
aI in UCSD's achieving its 14· 
10 record (the best in years), 
averaging 19 points over the 
past three years, 

Haynes says he came to 
UCSD for the academics, but 
believes athletics are keeping 
him in school, 

"The way I see it, you have

studies .. J'm here for the 
education. 1f ·1 just wanted to 
play basketball, I could have 
gone somewhere else. 

His girlfriend provides his 
emotional mainstay. She was 
one of the first people he met in 
San Diego, and is partially 
responsible for helping 
Haynes discipline himself 
about school. He feels he owes 
her a lot for her support. 

The other penon Haynes is 
dose to is Lem Lemons, 
assistant coach for the cagera, 

"Coach Lem and I have a 
similar attitude, 10 we're really 
dose. We're both sort of cocky 
and take basektball seriously. 
When I play, I want to do it 

wdl. I don't ~ke to lose." 
Haynes' approach to 

basketball parallels his 
philosophy about life in 
general. He has the fullest 
beard on the team. He likes to 
"play everything by ear" 
because "you only live one 
tj. " me. 

He doe,"'t like to react 
based on other people's 
advice, (although he .ay. he 
will listen to it,) because it 
gives an excuse to fall back on. 
In his own words, it results in 
having "other people to blame. 
When I do something, it's 
going to be me, and 111 be the 
only person I have to blame if 
it doesn't work out."

Cage Scores Commonplace Elements of Life 
COfIIita»d from ""Ie J

The latter opinion, I think , i. 
the acc:W'ate one. Bul it should 
also be noted that the self· 
righteous arrogance one 
would expect from an 
embattled veteran of arti.tic 
controversies i. absent in

I was lbuclc by his quiet

and, elJM!cially, hi. childlike 
IeI1se of wonder about things 

musical premise. are 81 .imple 
and timeless 81 they are 
antithetical to We.tern 
tradition. 

While his impact upon 
modern composer. (including 
those on the faculty of the 
UCSD Music Department) is 
obvioul, Cage readily admits 
that hi. musical approach i. 
stiD lhocking to the general 
American public . 

"My idea. have filtered 
down to about, at the most , 
100,000 people. " he says. To 
a large degree, he feels , the 
t8ltes of most people have 
been stultified by the mass 
media, whose influence Cage 
doesn't hesitate to condemn. 

Ayant c:ompoI« John ~-F ..... c.. ..... 
unknown and my.terious in 
life. He Weft a puckish smile 
when we talked about hi. 
music, but there were times 
when hi. face grew serious and 
hi. pze di.tant, indicating 
IOITIeIhing serious was on hi. 
mind. 

"All you have to do is 
merely pick up a newspaper to 
.ee that it hurts your 
intelligence. You .houId stay 
away from the papers and 
television. They keep people's 
minds misplaced." (It should 
be added that Cage also 
avoids . Iillening 10 record., 
preferring to hear mu.ic · 
performed live.) 

Cage's comments on the 
art. are intertwined with 
discussions of the world at 
large as well - he laments 
that lack of power creative 
people have to affect events. 

"There's nothing someone 
like me coukf possibly do to 
change the mind, say, of 
Richard Nixon , " Cage 
contends. "Our government, 
which i. supposed to be 10 
balanced and democratic, is 
chock full of lawyers. There 
isn ' t an artist present. " 

Recently he turned down an 
invitation to attend a White 
House function - "I wouldn't 
dream of going to anything our 
government would sponsor , 
ever, on principle." 

Guo",." pltoto hy ~ GieJJ 
governments cut off from the 
input of artists , Cage does 
have lOme good things to say 
about the state oE music, 
especially in Southern 
California, his native region.

unappreciative of much in ' 
avant garde music and 

"A great deal of interesting 
work is being done in this area,

this means a sense of

Cage Keeps Escaping 
Continued from fXJlle 6 
Henry Cowell and Harry 
Partch. " The musical 
ex~riments coming out of 
UCSD have impressed him: 
"The work here is excellent, 
varied and vigorous. The 
Music Department is creative, 
rather than just bent on 
performance." (He adds, 
though, that he finds the 
Mandeville Center architec· 
ture "frightfuL") 

T onijht, Cage and the 
Music Deparbnent will present 
a progran:! of the composer's 
work at 8:00 pm in the 
Mandeville Auditorium. 
Described by Cage as a 
musical "circus," it wiD be a 
musical realization of James 
JOYce's Finnegans Wake. 

"Through chance opera· 
tions, some of itl pieces will be 
played once, twice or ' three 
times," he explain. . This 

presentation is only part ot a 
series of Cage works based on 
Joyce, whom the composer 
greatly admires. 

In addition, while in San 
Diego he has worked on a new 
text, Themes And Varia'ions, 
a collection of poetic piece. 
designed to "find a way of 
writing that, while comu, 
from ideas, is not about them. ' 
Juxtaposing unrelated imases 
in random but evocative waYI, 
Cage considers it "exploring a 
new region that is very, very 
detailed. It's imitative of 
nature." 

"My work isn't underltood 
by critics," he says. "U I'm 
pigeonholed, I try to get.out of 
it. I try to get out of any 'cage' I 
happen to be in." As IDltamed 
as ever, Cage keeps on his 
own path - and others can 
only · try to en/'oy and 
appreciate his trave s.
