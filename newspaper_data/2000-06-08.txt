In a harsh example of the dan-

reporting that a Chinese herb, 
already linked to kidney failure, 
may cause cancer as well. 

The herb, Aristoloch i:> fangchi, 
was given to patients at a weight-

1992, according to a report being

UC Employees Rally for 
B .. ,.nts and $65 Million 
Protest took place hours before a UC investigative committee held 
a hearing looking into improved labor relations for the university 
.,MIX .... 
Stllff Writer 

Union members equipped with signs and 
banners rallied Wednesday morning to protest 
the recent growth of alleged unfair practices by 
the University of California. 

The rally took place at the information 
booth ncar the Gilman Drive entrance to 
UCSD. Participants protested the recent 
growth of alleged unfair labor practices by the 
university. 

A second rally occurred hours later at the 
Hillcrest Medical Center. 

Many issues were protested at the rallies, 
including health care, sexual harassment policy, 
UC procedures on discrimination and the 
diverting of S6S million originally marked for 
UC employee wage increases. 

The protest occurred hours before a hearing 
by the California State Assembly Higher 
Education Committee ilMStigating UC labor 

relations was to take place at the state capitol. 
the hearing was a follow-up to a similar one last 
Au~ust by the Senate Education Committee. in 
which UC President Richard Atkinson pledged 
to improve tense labor relations with UC 
employees. 

According to Terry Bunting, field represen-
tative for University Professional and Technical 
Employees, the unions sought better relations 
with the University of California. 

"The purpose of the rally is to keep UC a 
strong institution: Bunling said. "We're letting 
people know that these are the things that have 
been happening and that we want a more coop· 
erative relationship with the university." 

Tom Rankin. secretary of the California 
Labor Federation. shared this sentiment. 

"The University of California relies on its 
employees to provide quality teaching. research 
and patient care at its campuses, reslarch labs

New Regulations 
Ban Miriors 
From Chi Shows 
Cafe cancels summer shows in 
response to new rules calling 
for increased security 
., VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

In response to new university restric· 
tions, the Chi Cafe has canceled all of Its 
shows for June. July and August, and IS cur· 
rently sear hing for a way to stay In busi-
ness. 

Randy Woodard, the UCSD's advisor to 
the Che Cafe, said the univerSity's new poli-
cy requires that the Che restrict its shows to 
people 18 years of age and older, and that 
for shows drawing more than 75 people. the 
Chc must hire three security guards in addi-
tion to one supervisor. 

Previously, the Che was only required to 
hire two security guards. 

Woodard said the new policy comes In 
response to recent problems at the ChI! 
involving fights and alcohol use. In one 
instance, he said, a 14-year-old pa~ron was 
thrown to the ground and injured. 

"The university has reviewed and has 
been reviewing the Che for the past few 
months and found that it was not in the best 
interest of the university to continue to 
operate an all-ages venue," Woodard said . 

He added that if more incidents occurred 
involving minors, the univers ity, as well as 
members of the Che Cafe collective. could 
face a lawsuit. 

Spencer Gooch, a principal member of 
the collective, said the new policy was unfai r 
to the Che Cafe. 

"The restrictions are designed expressly 
to put the Che Cafe out of business: he 
said. "It's no secret that the administration 
has not liked the ChI! Cafe for a long time." 

He said that while the Che Cafe already 
spends approximately $88 per show for 
security staff, it would have to spend 
approximately $200 per show with the new 
policy in effect. 

While Che members have canceled 40 
shows f~r th is summer, they are committed 
to keeping it open. 

"We want to keep the music scene going, 
but we also want to keep the Che going: 
said ChI! Cafe principal member Amreen 
Karmali. "We need some time off to think 
about that now." .

Council Looks for Parking Solutions for Growing Campus

A8IDC". News Editor 

Amid problems revolving 
around on-campus parking and a 
new parking structure that will not 
open on time u initially planned. 
members of the A.5. Council have 
decided to produce a brochure to 
be passed out during Wdcome 
week regarding the parking prob-
lems at UCSD. 

-Even with the openin, of the 

new parkin$ structures. we are 
actually lOSing 'S' spots,~ said 
Marshall Sophomore Senator 
Shana Thakur. -Plus, with the 
large influx of students coming in 
the. recent years. the parking situa-
tion cannot compete." 

The new four-story. Torrey 
Pines parking structure bein$ built 
near North Parking resulted In the 
elimination of Lot 306. which had 
many spots Just for faculty and 
sllff. In addition. North Parking 

will be closcd by 2003 due the 
construction of the new Eleanor 
Roosevelt College campus. 

Though the new To~ Pines 
parking structure will hold 900 
cars. only 400 of these spots will be 
for students. This represents a 
decrease in the total number of 

"S~ spots that currently exist. 
"Although it is impossible to 

really change anything occurring 
with the actual construction tak· 
ing place in future years, this year's 

ASUCSD is working hard with the 
administration to help alleviate 
problems and make students' lives 
a bit easier: Thakur said . 

Though freshmen next year 
will be permittea to park on cam-
pus, the Welcome Week brochures 
are designed to dissuade them 
from bringing their cars with 
them.

Panhandler Suspected of More Fraud Since 
Wallet Theft Incident Last Week 
Woman with child allegedly applied for two credit cards in victim's name 
., IDICCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

Approximately 15 people have 
reported being approached and 
asked for money by a panhandler 
suspected of wallet theft. fraudu-
lent credit card charges and identi-
ty fraud since Monday. 

The woman, who used the 
name Chris~. was usually accom-
panied by i young girl whom she 
claims was her daughter. Denisha. 
The girl is described as being 8 or 
9 years old. Christy sometimes 
presents a drive.r's license to the 
people she approaches. 

According to police reports. 
the suspect tells people that she 
and her daughter have been 
dropped off and that her daugh-
ter has just received treatment for

been approved by Director of 
Parking and Thlnsportation Greg 
Sn~ • 

In order to ensure that such 
problems do not occur as fre-
quently in the yurs to come, the 
schoOl is looking into a new poli-
cy that would prohibit students 

livin~ in the reSidence halls from 
parking on campus. This would 
free up parking spots for those 
students living off campus. 

Thakur said that though it 
certainly is not a fair option. this 
plan seems viable in the interim 
due to the rapid increase of stu-
dents coming to the campus in 
the near future. 

"As of the year 2003, at the 

pital. and that they need a ride to 
their home in Chula Vista. If she 
is unable to convince the person 
to give them a ride, she asks for 
money. The described woman has 
also reportedly flagged down cars 
in parking lots. . 

"She's an aggressive panhan-
dler: said UCSD Police Detective 
Douglas O'Dell. 

According to O·Deli. the 
woman has filled out two credit 
card applications with the name 
of the 29-year-old female UCSD 
student who was reportedly 
robbed by the suspect last week. 
The address filled out on the 
application is of a party unrelated 
to the crime. 

Anyone who has handed out 
personal information or has shown 
their driver's license to the suspect 
is urged to check their credit 

opening of Roosevelt, there will be 
5.000 more students on campus.~ 
Thakur said. 

In addition. Thakur said that 
having a car while living in a resi-
dence hall is more of a luxury than 
a need. 

"The transit system, although 
sometimes argued as inadequate. 
does exist in San Diego." she said . 
"Dorm residents do not require 
access to the grocery stOrt, as they 
have meal points. ~ 

Students opposed to this poli-
cy have argued that this will only 
make the situation worse by not 
getting to the root of the prob-
lem. 

"Even if first-yurs do not have 
parking permits. the same prob-
lems will exist. ~ said Marshall 
freshman Eric Robin . "In myopin-
ion. you will just create frustration 
for those that are willing to pay the 
price for the pennit but cannot 
use their car:

were to be implemented. there

"You want to be careful how 
much infonnation you give out. 
not just to panhandlers." O'Dell 
said. 

According to police reports, 
the suspect is an African 
American female in her early 30s, 
5'7 tall, and weighing 170 
pounds. She has shoulder-len~th, 
red-streaked black hair worn 10 a

residence halls with special needs 
such as off-campus jobs. 

This policy i~ yet to be voted on 
by the administration and the A.S. 
Council. 

"This is' only one possible pro-
posal that will help to alleviate 
parking problems: Thakur said. "It 
is in no way a solution and is not 
the Knate parking committee's 
main focus. We are still exploring 
many alternatives that may prove to 
be more productive.· 

In addition, the eight-person 
A.S. subcommittee working on 
parking has proposed other solu-
tions to help alleviate some of these 
problems. such as increasing the 
shuttle hours, exp;:nding the car-

~I system. and increased security 
In the parking lots. 

The Parking and 
Transportation Committee IS 10 
favor of these solutions as reme-
dies to ease the parking problems. 
The university is expected to 
grow by over 20.000 students in 
the next 20 years.

~ A big "helJo" to the Guardian's new neighbor, Vice ChancelJor Joe Watson, who will be occupying the office space next to ours next year. 
Just let us know when you want to hold our 
first inter-office kegger, Joey. . 

Flops to Chancellor Robert [I] 
Dynes and Maya Angelou's knt!es -
for cancelling all-campus com-
mencement this year. 

• 

~ Kudos to all the TAs for finally wrestling the administration to the ground and making them cry 
"Uncle!" in their contract negoti-

ations. 

Thumbs down to parking in 
general, and parking construc- [I] 
tion in particular, for ruining our 
lives and driving us to an early 
grave. 

~ A big flipper up to those altru-istic dolphins who pulled Elian Gonzalez out Qf the sea and unwittingly doomed us to 
months of mind-numbingly boring news 
stories. 

Thumbs down to the A.S. 
Council's illicit trip to New YOrk '[g 
this past year. You know that we 
love the Big Apple, and you didn't 
even invite us. 

~ Thumbs down to the Internet - for spawning all kinds of law-suit-prone companies like MP3.com and Napster. It's true, 
. the Internet does make a new millionaire 

everyday - unfortunately, they're all 
lawyers. 

Thumbs down to the 
deplorable state of the housing [g' 
and job markets in San Diego. We 
changed our minds; we don't 
want to graduate after all. 

00 A muscular thumbs up to Russell Crowe for taking on the role of Maximus and whipping those tigers in "Gladiator." We 
couldn't have done it better ourselves. 

A thumbs down each for I ~I 
George W Bush and AI Gore for -
making this the most bland pres-
idential campaign in recent histo.-
ry, Wait, there's a presidential election this 
year? 

- finals. Thanks for reminding us ~ An annual middle finger up to of the earthly pleasures of coffee, all-nighters and useless cram-
ming.

the last yellow parking spot at high 
noon, enter a lottery to earn a space in 
highly coveted on-campus hOUSing, or

lecture would shudder at the thought 
of an additional 5,000 students com-
peting for these limited resources."

"Sometimes, we get so wrapped up in 
our studies and relationships that we for-
get what is going on in the nation and 
world around us, Read the newspaper, 
watch CNN, or if you arc really low on

"All this time. I have taught that diver-

that freedom to live and believe as you

concept of international marriages as a 
means of improving relations a long

by fellow pandas, who are already con-

Media Fails t~ Report News to the Public 
Editor. 
In a country founded on the idea 

of questioning authority, Alexis 
Denny, Annie Herini and Elisa 
Wiefel's article on the news media 
("News Media Gets High marks for 
Purpose," May 30) is a disappoint-
ment. Do the local news stations 
donate to the Guardian? It is crucial 
that readers question their news 
sources. The article says, "we have 
long conditioned ourselves" to do 
so, but I disagree. 

Without the extensive discus-
sions and research I've done in my 
media class, I would, like most 
Guardian readers, have taken this and 
other articles for truth. Most news 
stories are not presented in ways to 
provoke intelli~ent thought -
rather, they are dICtated to the audi-
ence to simply be accepted as reality. 

Upon reading texts such as 
Michael Parenti's "Inventing Reality: 
the Politics of News Media: I 
learned about the bias in news. Only 
eight corporations control the three 
major TV networks. 200 cable sta-
tions, 60 radio stations, 59 magazines 
- including Ttmt and NtwrwttII -
and chains of newspapers including 
the New yort TI1TItS, the waU SIrttt 
]oumoJ, the Los Anp Trmes and the 
Washingtm Post. 

These figures are as of 1990; it is 
even worse today. What goes in the 
news Is under the ultimate control of 
a handful of wealthy, conservative, 
middle-aged white businessmen. Do 
they repaent the rest of America, 
with all its edmic and socio-econom-
ic dMBity? Do they represent you? 
If media is a forum for the people. 
some people are not being heard 

The II1ide says the purpose of 
media is to inform. I agree. yet I 
beIieft today's media fails to meet 
this goal. How can it inform when

The UCSD Guardian OPINION A9 

Law Gives Student Illformation to Recruiters 
Parents wiU be forced to fight off unwanted attention from military recruiters to protect their children 
By_HAN 
Associate Opinion Editor 

With the recent introduction of 
legislation on April 11 requiring 
high schools to provide the same 
student information to college and 
military recruiters, the U.S. military 
won a quiet battle in the Senate 
Armed Services committee. 
Recruiters will have access to a stu-
dent's name. age and telephone 
number. Access to this information 
will be in addition to the existing 
policy of allowing military recruiters 
to visit high school campuses. 

Parents are battling to prevent 
Internet companies and pedophiles 
from accessing their children's per-
sonal information, but another 
potentially dangerous group .... the 
military - now has such data read-
ily available to it 

This legislation is a step in the 
wrong direction, burdening parents 
with men factors trying to control 
the outside influences on their kids. 
Parents who are antimilitary will 
need to constantly fight off recruiter 
phone calls and remind their chil-
dren why they believe they should 
not join the military. 

Even worse is the case for par-

ents who never thought about dis-
cussing the possibility of joining the 
military with their children. They 
may tind their children forming 
biased vieWs of the military under 
the sole influence of a deceptive 
recruiter. Those parents blitzed by 
the military recruiters may find It 
too late to change their children's 
minds. 

Parents in San Diego became 
concerned when military recruiters 
began calling their children. After 
they complained to the board' of 
education, the San Diego Unified 
School District restricted recruiters' 
access to student information. With 
the legislation recently passed on 
the natiorlll level, however, these 
parents again have to fight to keep 
their kids away from recruiters. In 
an area such as San Diego, with 
public support for the military and a 
targe military presence, parents who 
want to keep the recruiters at bay 
will have a difficult time. 

Parents have good reasons to 
keep the recruiters away. As a 
recruiter's job is to enlist as many 
soldiers as he can, he often does not 
have the enlistee's best interests in 
mind. This does not mean all 
recruiters are out to take advantage 

of enlistees, because there are many 
dedicated recruiters who watch out 
for enlistees' interests. However, 
pressure to constantly produce 
enlistees leads some recruiters to 
provide misleading infonnation to 
attrnct potential recruits. 

High school students who are 
minors are especially good candi-
dates for recruiters. With parental 
consent, 17 -year-olds can legally 
enlist in the armed forces. 
Recruiters also hand out their 
phone numbers to younger teens, 
and encourage them to sign up 
when they tum 17. Inexperienced 
and impressionable teens could 
easily fall prey to deceptive 
recruiters. An~ 'one visiting the San 
Diego Military Entrance Processing 
Service will see mostly high school 
students getting ready to be sworn 
into the military. Many of these 
young men and women did not 
make well-informed decisions and 
are not mentally and physically 
ready for li~ in the military. A num-
ber of these young soldiers termi-
nate their enlistment and leave the 
military before the contracted time. 
beroming attrition statistics. 

The U.S. military has high attri-
tion rates right now, due partly to 

recruiting unsuitabk and unquali-
fied soldiers. 

According to a report by an Air 
Force officer, Air Force attrition 
rates can be as high as 30 percent. 
The Army and Marine Corps can 
lose even more soldiers than the Air 
Force. High a~rition rates lead to 
more indiscriminate recrUiting, 
which in turn leads to higher attri-
tion rates. High school students are 
the most sought-after commodity 
by recruiters who fuel this vicious 
cycle. 

What recruiters do nO! tell enlis-
tees can often hurt them. Soldiers 
who leave the forces before the 
contracted time face discrimination 
in jobs and government benefits. 
and they sometimes even face legal 
prosecut.ion. This is especially the 
case for soldiers who decide to go 
absent without leave, which means 
to have unexcused absences from 
the military. These are conse-
quences that close off precious 
opportunities for high school Stu-
dents and can make their futures 
bleak. There is no guarantee the 
recruiter will let high school stu-
dents know the commitment

AIO OPINION 

Desire to Learn Lost in 
Maze of Freshman V.-
Enthusiasm usually wanes by the end of first year 
Columnist 

I seem to have lost it, or at least 
temporarily misplaced it. I came here 
so fu ll of it, and now it seems to have 
drained away. It is the passion for 
learning. It is the excitement of 
expanding my horizons. It is what I 
want to have again. 

I know I am not the only one 
with th is dilemma. I see it troubling 
the faces of my peers and hear it in 
their conversations. Maybe they 
don't view it in the same tragic 
manner as I do, but its presence 
cannot be ignored. 

Is this not the reason I came to 
such a place as UCSD? This is why 
I worked so hard in my classes and 
did not shed a tear at my high school 
graduation. My thoughts were con-
sumed with coming to this institu-
tion of higher learn ing. I was so 
eager to come here and take classes 
of my choice and study topics that 
are intellectually stimulating. 

That was my initial sentiment 
upon arrival, but somehow it has 
changed. The quarter system moves 
at a rapid pace, and before I knew it, 
it was third quarter. The onset of 
burnout and exhaustion seemed to 
arrive spring quarter. Trekking 
through the jungle of GEs is no sim-
ple task either, and has begun to take 
its toll . However, I rejoice just know-
ing that once the jungle is con-
quered, there is the lake of the upper 
division major courses to dive imo 
for a refn:shing, cleansing swim. 

The spring weather is not very 
helpful. When the sun shines 
brightly in the sky, and the ocean 

breeze is mild, it seems like that is 
nature's way of calling. The waves of 
the ocean seem to whisper, "Put 
down those books and come to me," 
and one's only option is to comply. 

When it comes down to a battle 
between the books and the beach, 
the winner is rather obvious. 

Living on campus also affects 
students' attitudes. Being surround-
ed by peers can be incredibly posi-
tive. but at the same time. a draw-
back. If the surrounding people have 
negative attitudes toward classes and 
openly denounce professors or 
course materials. it can be easy just 
to go along with what they say, 

. jumping on the bandwagon and let-
ting them influence your attitude. 

That was what we came here to 
avoid. It was our goal not to con-
form to the music of the masses, 
but to create our own sound - to 
think for ourselves. We should be 
able to appreciate a book or class 
for finding it intriguing and not be 
afraid to admit it. There should be 
no shame for a love of learning. 

It is true that you do not know 
what you have until it is gone. 
Although the load of reading, and 
looming, dark shadows of finals may 
be straining now, these times will be 
missed. When there is nothing to do 
and life seems poindess. an incredi-
ble desire to learn will emerge. "I've 
got to go back to school" will be the 
words uttered. 

I look forward to this summer 
and the break it offers from the rig-
orous year. When I return this faU, 
however, I will have rediscovered my 
passion for learning and will intend 
not to let it slip away again. ,

bad gowns and stingy scholarships

World New. 
Turkey Trying to Ease Tensions in the Aegean 

ISTANBUL, Thrkey - For 
decades the AC$ean Sea has been 
not just a vaaUOn spot but also a 
zone of military confrontation. 
Now Turkey is debating a step that 
could considerably reduce tension 
there. 

A retired admiral who is an 
adviser to Prime Minister Bulent 
Ecevit has recommended that 
Turkey disband its 100,OOO-man 
Aegean army. 

The army is deployed along the 
AeJean coast and confronts Greek 
unats based on islands that lie in 
some ases only a few miles off-
shore. 

Ecevit has not commented on 
the four-page "action plan" pre-
sented by the adviser. Adm. 

. Guven Erkaya. The Jeneral staff 
said the question of dissolving the 
Aegean force was not on their 
agenda. 

The fact that the plan was writ-
ten by such a high-ranking figure, 
and that its contents were so 
prominently reponed in the 
Turkish press. has opened a 
national debate over this question 
for the first time. • 

The debate comes after nearly 
a year of steadily improving rela-
tions between Greece and Turkey. 
Ha"ing now resolved many of 
their minor disputes, they must 
now decide whether to move 
ahead to the two big ones: Cypnll 
and the Aegean. 

With Cyprus perhaps the more 

complex problem, Thrkish leaders 
are apparently reflecting on how 
they can make progress in the 
Aegean. There Greece and Turkey 
are locked in a tangle of sovereign-
ty disputes over sea lanes, air 
rights and barren islets. A con-
frontation over one islet led the 
two countries to the brink of war 
in 1996. 

"In the course of the European 
Union accession process Thrkey 
must solve its problems with 
Greece by 2004." Erkaya wrote, 
reftrring to the application for 
membership in the union. 

For the last several months. 
private groups of Greeks and 
Thrks have been meeting to dis-
cuss the problems that separate 

their countries. 
"As both parties get to know 

each other and believe in eac~ 
other's sincerity, an atmosphere 
of confidence is born: wrote 
Mehmet Ali Birand, a newspaper 
and television commentator who 
has also taken part. 

"That someone such as 
Erkaya, whose life has been 
dominated by Turkish-Greek 
and Aegean problems, who has 
been burdened with great 
responlibilities and known for 
being a conservative with rigid 
attitudes, has made such a pro-
posal has impressed a lot of peo-
ple," he continued.

Japan Finally Catches Up in E-Mail and Cell Phone Use 
TOKYO - As if all at once, 

e-mail ' by phone has arrived in 
japan. 

If any further proof were need-
ed, the official statistics are in: 10 
million e-mail-apable telephones 
are now in use throughout the 
country. 

Japan had been one of the 
slowest developed countries to 
take to e-mail, thanks in pan to 
the paucity of home computers. 
But by next year, according to 
some Industry estimates. Internet 
usage in Japan will be the highest 
in the world, largely as a result of 
the explosive spread of cellular 
phones. 

Given the frenzied way that 
corrapondence by cellular phone 
is tUmg the country by storm, it is 
only natural to wonder what in the 

=,Ih~IR~ to each 
ny, "What are you eating for 

lunch?" or "Where are you now?" 
said 16-yar-01d Satom Ishihara, 
reading two of the latest messages 

from her linIe phone. 
On the evidence, the strained 

eyes and linguistic gymnastics 
required to enter substantial 
amounts ohat into this country's 
ultra-compact phones are sacri-
fices made for bnIe more than the 

as the dining room, before finally 
becoming the bedroom. But with 
the cell phone. the japanese have 
enjoyed a pocket-sized privacy. 

With the introduction of rudi-
mentary Internet service on mil-
lions of cell phones here last year, 

Alre~ in the short time span that cell phone e-
mail has been in use, there are signs that these kinds 
of linguistic sleights of hand are spreading into 
general usage. 

smallest of small talk.. 
With the cellular phone, the 

japanese have married the ever--
faster world of the Internet with 
the seemingly ever-smaller world 
of japanese gadgetry. and the 
repercussions for life here, for the 
Japadne laftpage and for the 
future of technology are still being 
tallied. 

Many japanese homes are so 
small that the living room doubles 

this private realm has been dra-
matially expanded. Making this 
work has required another feat of 
miniaturization - with the coun-
try's written language. 

Four different writing systems 
are in constant, simultaneous use 
in Japan. To • practi~, ~tin~ 
on a typical 1 S-bunon keyboard 
ails for hyper-concision. 

For this reason, cellular phone 
makers have added a whole new 

set of symbols to the linguistic 
stew: 200 or so pictographs 
depicting simple objects like golf 
clubs, karaoke boxes, movie pro-
jectors. food and faces reflecting 
various emotional states, all of 
which are now used in combina-
tion with ordinary writing to form 
words. Think of the happy face 
run wild. 

Already, in the short time span 
that cell phone e-mail has been 
in use, there are signs that these 
kinds of linguistic sleights of 
hand are spreading into general 
usage. 

"If something becomes part of 
everyday life. there will be an 
influence on writing," said 
Hiroyuki Sasahara, a researcher 
at the National Language 
Research Institute in Tokyo. 
" People: have actually begun to 
use these symbols in their hand-
written leners.~

Cases of kidney failure from this

Chri~tine Lewis, di rector of the 
office of nutritional products, label-

sa id there had been no reports of 
Americans being harmed by 
Aristolochia . She also said the FDA 
did not know how much of the 
herb might be on the U.S. market. 

But last month, the FDA sent 
leners to doctors and to the supple-
ment industry, with a six-page list of 
herbal remedies known or suspect-
ed of containing Aristolochia. The 
agency urged manufacturers to test 
their products for the presence of 
the herb. 

Within a few weeks, importation 
of the herb, includ i n~ every item on 
the six-page list, Wi ll be banned, 
Lewis said. 

Herbs. amino acids. vitamins and 
other "supplements: a $15 billion

Unlike drugs. they do not have to Ix

even checks to make sure that the 
products actually contain the ingre-

patients given transplants or dialy-
sis at Erasme Hospital in Brussels. 
Eighteen of the 39 have also devel-
oped cancer of the urinary system. 
Nineteen others have abnormal 
cells in the urinary tract, possibly 
precancer. 

In an editorial accompanying the 
article, David Kessler, former head of 
the FDA and now dean of the Yale 
School of Medicine, urged Congress 
to give the FDA more power over

WASHINGTON - The long-
ruMing effon to bring the French 
abonion pill to women in th is 
country has encountered yet 
another obstacle: a su~tion by 
the Food and Drug Administration 
that it may place tiltht restrictions 
on how the drug. Il:U-486, is dis-
tributed and who an prescribe it. 

lYPically, once a drug is 
approved. any doctor can prescribe 
it for any purpose. But people 
familiar with negotiations between 
the FDA and the sponsor of RU-
486, which is also known as 
mifepristone, say the agency is 
consIdering taking several unusual 

st~ incfuding restricting pre-
scnbing privUqa 10 doctors who 
perform lurgical abortions. 

1l1at would effectively eliminate 
what advocates of abortion rights 
see as mifqmstone's main advan-
tage. moving the procedure out of. 
high-profile clinics and into the pri-
vate offices of gynecologists. family 
practitioners and other doctors. 

"It kills the drug if it can't be 
used by primary care providers.· 
said Eric Schaff, a professor of fam-
ily medicine at the University of 
Rochester who has run clinical tri-
als of RU-486 in the United States. 
"The whole idea of mifepristone 
was to increase access." 

A study released Wednesday by 
the Kaiser Family Foundation found 
that one in three gynecologists who 
do not perform abortions would 
prescribe miftpristone if it were 

approved by the FDA. But the study 
also found that dOctors would have 
second thoughts if they were 
required to undergo training to use 
the drug, another condi t~on the 
FDA is considering imposing. 

Heather O'Neill , a spokes-
woman for the Danco Group, the 
investors who have licensed those 
rights and are arranging for the 
drug to be manufactured and dis-
tributed in this country, said, "The 
agency's_ initial approach is more 
restrictive than we had envisioned 
for a drug that has been used safe-
ly by so many women." 

the agency has until Sept. 30 to 
make a decision .

School Systems Find Innovative Leaders 
SAN DIEGO - Alan D. Bersin, 

superintendent of the San Diego 
schools, is talking IOUgh with 3S 
student teachers: 

-Our ~ng levels. by and 
large. are abysmal: he tells them. 
The dropout rate i. huge. he says. 
and he has laid off 600 paraprofes-
sionals because "they have added 
vinuaUy nothing to student 
achievement." 

It is all pan of his sweeping 
campaign to reshape the schools. 
with ~bed blocks of time for 
teachlna literacy, and constant 
teacher training In me methods to 
be' used. 

Bersin is a former U.s, attorney, 
one of me first of a new breed of 
high-profile noneducaton tUmg 
om' blg-dty school districts. 

On Thesday, the Los Angeles 
board of education named Roy 
Romer, the former Colorado gover-
nor, as its superintendent. In May. 
Harold O. Levy, a corporate lawyer, 
was chosen to lead the New York 
City school system. 

Other urban districts, too, have 
turned to law, business. govern-
ment and the military for new lead-
ership and an outside perspective. 
Seattle has had two nontraditional 
superintendents in a row. one from 
the military, one from the private 
sector. Houston'~ superintendent is 
a fonner school board member; 
Chicago'S a former city budget 
director; Kansas City'S a former top 
federal aviation official. 

Many of the nontraditional 
.uperintendents split the responsi-

bilities of leading their districts, 
handling school board meetings, 
bond issues, union maners and 
politics themselves, but leaving 
issues of pedagogy to a deputy with 
eduational credentials. 

Until the 199Os, it was almost 
unthinkable to choose a big-city 
superintendent from outside edu-
cation. Traditionally. they were for-
mer teachers who became princi-
pals and then superintendents. 

But what has driven the trend 
toward nontraditional superinten-
dents is precisely the sense that 
educators have failed the schools 
- and that outsiders may have an 
edge in effecting change.

your fellow stLJC:knts, but after you 
saw that many people didn't seem 
to be giving out much efton. you 
decided to give up. That is where I 
was attempting to help. 

If people slowly begin to pay 
more attention to school events 
and become more social around 
campus, they will have the effect of 
a multiplier - others will see those 
people and decide that they don't . 
need to give up hope. I know that I 
talk about Sun God as if it is the 
end-all and be-all of our UCSD 
existena. but it proves to be a very 
good example of what I am talking 
about. Why do you think that 

evel)'~ is so much happier and 
social on the seventh Friday of 
spring quaner than any other day? 

It is true that there are many 
people on campus that day that 
don't go to this school, but the big 
reason for this ~han e in atmos-
phere is that eve y knows they 
are supposed to having I good 
time on this day and they know 
everyone else will be social and 
happy as well. It is all about the 
atQtude of the students. 

When I tell you to get out to a 
sporting event or go to a pany and 
get drunk or whatever, my overaU 
goal is to raise the level of rnoraIe at 
this school from the current dol-
drums and tty to recreate the Sun 
God atmosphere aU year long. 

I know many of you fed out of 
place here and think of UCSD as 
nothi" more then a place for an 
education. 1h!st me, it doesn't haft 
to be like that. I love it here, and I 
want the rest of.you to love it, too. 
Part of enjoying yourself is getting 
out and meeting people. I have a 
great group of friends and the great-
est girl in the world for a girlfriend. 
Th9 are much of the reason I have 
really enjoyed my time at UCSD. 

Another key to enjoying this 
school is getting involved in some-
thing. I know I am starting to .sound 
likc,one of those cheerleaders on the 
first day of high school, but it really 
is true: The Guardian has been my 
oudet. Through it, I have IDa some 
of the most intelligent and interest~ 
ing people I know. I am not saying 
that all of you should try writing for 
this newspaper; far from it. I am 
telling you to find something you 
like and do it. Once you do, I guar-
an~e this school will begin to look a 
whole lot better to you. 

That is all I have to say. I hope 
that all of you have a good summer 
and come back next year with the 
thought that you can help change 
this place into the kind of school 
that you want. I also apologize for 
my uncharacteristic rant that is 
obviously a depanure from my 
usual style of complaining about the 
sony state of proiessional sports or 
some other connected topic.

Fencing Team Bids Adieu to a Triumverant of Stars B.seball: 
A group of do-everything 
guys is leaving Hannah Griffith, Julia Kulla-Mader and Seth Goldman have all earned a ticket to the real world 

IyIIU ... '" 
Sports Editor 

The 2000 season was the most . 
successful in the history of UCSD 
fencing. Head Coach Stuart Lee 
led his troops to first-place finish-
es in the conference in both men's 
and women's competition and had 
four individual winners out of the 
six weapons. It was the first time 
ever that the men won the confer-
ence championship and the sec-
ond time for the women. 

With all this history of success 
now in the rearview mirr:>r, Lee 
will have to say goodbye to three 
of the athletes who helped bring 
him and his team to this pinnacle. 
Hannah Griffith, Seth Goldman 
and Julia Kulla-Mader have all 
fenced their last matches for the 
Tritons. 

Griffith was the wild card of the 
UCSD team for the past three sea-
sons. 

"Hannah always surprised me 
with how well she fenced; Lee 
said. "She didn't practice much or 
take real good lessons, but she was 
always an animal when it came to 
competition: 

Griffith took first place in 
women 's epee in the conference 
this season and was one of the 
four Triton competitors to win an 
individual title at the conference 
championship match . 

After graduation, Griffith, a 
dance major, will be attending a 
dancing clinic. 

Goldman was consistently one 
of hardest-working fencers on the 

team. 
"Seth was always a constant 

performer: Lee said. ·He was 
never a sw, but he gave us wins 
when we needed them. He had a 
great work ethic and was always 
the kind of guy that you wanted 
on your team: 

In addition to being a model 
athlete, Goldman found time to 
maintain a 3.80 grade point aver~ 
age in microbiology. When he 
graduatts, Goldman plans to go to 
graduate school in biology and get 
his master's degree. 

Kulla-Mader was the foil squad 
captain her sophomore year, the 
epee captain her junior year and 
the overall team captain her senior 

year. Lee was impressed by Kulla-
Mader's work ethic and ability. 

·Julia was a top athlete every 
year she fenced, Lee said. ·She 
took the most consistent lessons 
of all the fencers and was a ttam 
leader on and off the strip: 

Kulla-Mader was second in the 
conference in epee her junior year, 
but gave up individual accolades 
this season in order to ~elp her 
ttam. With the season nearing its 
conclusion, Kulla-Mader was with-
in suiking distance of Griffith for 
top honors in epee competition. 
Instead of being selfish and going 
for the title. she changed back to 
foil, the weapon she fenced her first 
two years. in order to help assure a 

women's overall victory. 
The move worked to perfec-

tion. Kulla-Mader dropped to 
fourth in epee competition but 
was dominant in foil and helped 
her team coast to its second over-
all victory in the 13-year history of 
the ttam. 

The move to Division II will 
not affect the fencing team 
because it is in the conference and 
will be staying there next season. 

Lee and his fencers should be 
among the elite in the conference 
again next year, but the loss of 
Griffith, Goldman and Kulla-
Mader will certainly hurt. Good 
luck in future endeavors, 1liton 
fencers.

learned from baseball through 
playing on a team and what that 
taught me. It was greater than what 
I learned in the classroom." 
Goldfarb said. 

·Yosh is everything we're look-
ing for in a ballplayer." O'Brien 
said. ·He is very mature and gives 
us what is needed: 

With his U.S. history degree, 
Goldfarb wants to work in the front 
office of a Major League Baseball 
team. He also plans to return 
someday to' school and get a grad-
uate degree. 

One thing the Triton seniors are 
taking aNay from UCSD is the 
experience of having had a great 
coach. All agr.ee that O'Brien gives 
everything he has to the team day 
in and day out. 

·Coach O'Brien just loves base-
ball,~ Ishak said. ·On the field, off 
the field, it doesn't matter, he gives 
it his all. He has really turned this 
place into a program." 

The sun eventually sets on 
everything, and after four years it 
has set on the UCSD baseball 
careers of these five seniors. The 
fat lady belts her baseball aria for 
Hinson, Terrell, Ishak, Goldfarb 
and Strobl. Gleaned from their 
times as Tritons will be cherished 
memories and lessons not soon 
forgotten . Taken mdependently or 
together, each and every one of 
these seniors will be sorely 
missed. To all five of these leaders, 
good luck in whatever you may 
choose to do.

Women's Water Polo is Casting off Five who are Graduating This June 
Loss of leadership comes with the departure of Maryam Hadiashar, Alice Huszcs, Jen Shevelend, Linda Monro (lnd Angie Kondrat 
.,1COn_ 
Staff Writer 

After many hours spent getting 
prune hands and sunburnt, five 
women's water polo players are 
moving on . Graduating this year 
are Maryam Hadiashar, Alice 
Huszcs, Jen Shevelend, Linda 
Monroe and Angie Kondrat. They 
will be leaving behind a legacy that 
will continue to thrive in the sea-
sons to come. Their contribution 
to building that legacy will not be 
forgotten by their teammates, and 
the pool will feel a little bit emptier 
when practice begins next year. 

Hadiashar was the starting goal-
keeper for the Triton squad this year 
and an important factor in many of 
the ~m's victories. Guarding the 
cage IS no easy task, but Hadiashar 
did it with finesse. 

Her effons garnered her not 
only the prestigious postseason 
award of Triton Team MVP, but 
also the Women's Water Polo 
Association's League MVP. 

These accolades are well earned 
according to Coach Larry Sanders. 

·She really sttpped up her game 
this year and was a key contribu-
tor," Sanders said, "alwaYSllaying 
with true determination an grit: 

Hadiashar's in-pool exploits were 
only matched by the impact this 
three-time team captain had on the 
team in the rare moments they were 
out of the Water. 

.Maryam was a great leader, in 
and out of the pool: Sanders said. 
·She was extremely unsdfish 8Il.d 
helpful to the younger players. Her 
leadership really helped the team 
chemistry and it wiU definittly be 
missed by her ttammatcs." 

At S'6~, Hadiashar did not pos-
sess the physical attributes that 

most effective college goalies do, 
yet her int~nsity in the pool helped 
her to achIeve great success. That 
success included tallying enough 
saves to place h~r second all-time 
for Triton goal-keepers. 

Kondrat was the team's co-cap-
tain this past season. This clearly 
illustrates the regard with which the 
team held her because the team 
chooses the position. This season, 
her fourth in the women's water 
polo program here at UCSD, was a 
high point for Kondrat. She shined 
in the pool on many occasions. 
Contributing mainly off the bench, 
Ko,ndrat's left-handed attack 
proved effective for the Tritons. Her 
consistent play and tenacious 
defense impressed Sanders. 

·She was definitely an asset for 
us. ~ Sander Yid, "bringing strong 
ckfense to the table and always hav-
ing a positive effect on the team." 

Huszcz is another Triton polo 
player who is moving on. Her con-
tributions to the team will not soon 
be forgonen though, as she was a 
true force for the program. She 
possessed a strong work ethic that 
paid off this past season, as she was 
voted the team's Most Improved 
Player by her teammates. Huszcz 
had to overcome some adversity 
before she could perform in the 
pool, but Sanders recalls nothing 
but positive contribution. 

·She would really work hard at 
practice and it showed in the 
games,~ Sanden said. "Every time 
she came out, she did it with ener-
gy and enthusiasm and always had 
fun, which is important ~ 

Shevelend and Monroe fol-
lowed similar paths in their water 
polo careers. Both women compet-
ed with the team their freshmen 
years, then opted to pursue other

rejoining the team this past season. 

~ were important players for 
the 1litons this year. Shevelend 
brought her own brand of water 
polo to the table, contributing in an 
offmsive role many times 

·She was all business in the 
pool. very aggressive and no-non-
sense," Sanden said. "She is some-
one you would always want to be a 
pan of your team." he said.

Monroe also added to the team 
in her stint here at UCSD, doing 
whattver it took to help out the 
squad. Her speedy play was a big 
plus for the Tritons. as ~as her atti-

Mass Moement of Runners, Jumpers and Throwers Taking Off 
A horde of 19 proud Tritons, who had as many differen~ specilties as people, will be earning their diplomas this month 
I, IIOIIeRT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD track team is losing 
a large chunk of players to gradua-
tion this June. 

It is no surprise that so many 
are departing, beca use there are 
about 100 different athletes on the 
track team. 

The 19 departing track mem-
bers are John Bello, Rory Clarke, 
Maggie Dwire, Jim Freeman, 
Damian Garcia, Jarrod Hammes, 
Amy Hawkins, Amy Kitchen, Lilian 
Liu, Matthew Meskimen, Anne 
Moore, Babatunde Ogundipe, 
Rosanna Olsen, Danielle Scheibli, 
Jessica Schugart, Lezlee Tamo, 
Michael Wangler, Margarette 
Wikander and Benton Wong .. 

"John Bello has been a real stable 
influence on the team; said Head 
Coach Tony Salerno. "He started out 
a distance runner as a freshman and 
found his home. finally, in the 400-
meter run." 

Clarke. though hampered by 
injuries, bounced back to have a 
decent year. 

"Rory Clarke is a distance run-
ner and a standout BOO-meter run-
ner over his tenure here; Salerno 
said. "He suffered through some 
injuries this year that slowed him 
down a bit." 

Maturity and leadership are 
some of the things that a senior 
brings to the track. Dwire encom-
passed both of these things. 

"Maggie is a great captain; 
Salerno said of fifth-year Dwire. 
"She's a very mature young lady. I 
always kid her about being really old, 
but she's been a standout per-
fonner." 

Freeman was one of the best 
runners UCSD has ever seen. 

"We caU him the fog; Salerno 
said. "He's an amazingly quiet per-
son. He barely speaks above a whis-
per, ever." 

Freeman earned his stripes as a 
hurdler. 

"He made tremendous improve-
ments this year on the hurdles,· 
Salerno said. "He knocked a half a 
second off his time in the 11 O-meter 

hurdles, which is pretty amazing." 
Some runners, like Garcia, are 

noted for coming through in the 
clutch. 

"Damian Garcia is an BOO run-
ner: Salerno said. "He's been a sta-
ble performer.· 

Many athletes transferred to 
UCSD before making the record 
books, like Hammes did from Mesa 

College. . 
"He did some great things for us 

in the 200 and the 400; Salerno 
said. "He's ranked No. 9 all time in 
the 200 and fourth in the 400." 

UCSD often has opportunities 
other campuses do not. Hawkins 
was dissatisfied with UC Santa 
Cruz's lack of a track or cross

Five on Baseball Team to Fly Over the Outfield Fence This Month 
Brian Hinson, Brian 'ferrell, Edward Ishak, Yeshayah Goldfarb and losh Strobl all now look toward the future 
Staff Writer 

"Pomp and Circumstance; that 
ubiquitous graduation song, rings 
loudly in the minds of five UCSD 
baseball players this year. 

Crossing the stage of gradua-
tion will be Josh Strobl, Brian 
Terrell, Brian Hinson, Edward 
Ishak and Yeshayah Goldfarb. 
These five are about to jump into 
the vastness of life beyond college 
and issue fond farewells to the 
Triton Baseball Field and the 
coaches and players who made 
their time in a Triton uniform 
enjoyable. 

Every one of these players is like 
Pericles, a leader through and 
through. There are no bad apples 
in this bunch; no A1cibiades, 
Rodmans or Rockers - only 
Russels and Gherigs. Jordans and 
DimaggiO$. 

"We are losing five outstanding 
leaders.· said Head Coach Dan 
O'Brien. "This year, our team 
chtmlstry was better than I have 
seen it in a long time. Each and 
every one of the seniors. whether 
an everyday contributor or not, was 
a contributor to that. It is going to 
hurt to lose five guys with such 
good characters. " 

All five players filled a spot for 
the Tritons. Hinson was the closer, 
the Man of Steel. The saying used 
to be. "When the going fctS tOugh, . 
the tough get going. For the 
Tritons. at least. the saying now 
reads; When the going gets tough. 
caU on Hinson: • 

"Hinson was a bulldog; 
O'Brien said. "We needed someone 
to spit nails for us. Hinson came in 
and did that: 

In the last two years. Hinson set 

records for appearances by a 
UCSD pitcher. A submariner, he 
gave it everything he had and his 
vivacity was rarely matched. 

Strobl played first base and 
third base for the Thtons. With 
injuries to key players Matt 
Merrifield and Eric Thorpe. Strobl 
was Mr. Utility, doing everything he 
was asked. 

"He is a great all-around guy; 
O'Brien said. "He stepped uf when 
he had to and showed lots 0 matu-
rity." 

Despite that fact that he played 
a couple of different positions this 
year, Strobl was a Siren-like mag-
net for ground balls, posting a .950 
fielding percentage. 

Ishak was a pitcher for the 
Tritons. When John Beaven, the 
resident UCSD fireballer, went 
down with a midscason injury, 
Ishak came up big. In his final start 
in the blue and gold, Ishak was 
imr.re5sive. pitching a two-hit four 
strikeout shutout against the 
University of Redlands. 

"It was like a dream out there; 
said Ishak, who with his computer 
science degree will be working for 
Microsoft next ycar. "I could not 
have scripted It any beuer. My 
teammates gave me everything I 
needed ~ manufacturing that one 
run, and It was perfrct." 

Ishak is planning on traveling 
to Switzerland this summer to play 
baseball.

A22 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Pair of Powerful Putters Powerdriving to Graduation 
Through roughs and water hazards, Rex Vanderpool and james Donahoe always made the green 
By ARYIND YUAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team will be 
without two talented players 
next year due to their senior sta-
tus. Their names are James 
Donahoe from Hemet, Calif. and 
Rex Vanderpool from Del Mar, 
Calif. 

Both players contributed great-
ly to the team's success over the 
years, perfecting their abilities and 
representing UCSD as well as any 
two players could. 

Their individual contributions 
over the four-year span are cer-
tainly mentionable. 

Head Coach Mike Wydra had 
nothing but praise for his 6-foot 
155-pound senior. . 

"James has to be among the 
top three golfers UCSD has 
seen,w Wydra said. "He was con-
sistently amazing on the golf 
course and actually had the low-
est stroke average of any other 
player in UCSD men's golf histo-
ry with 73.7. He will be sorely 
missed.w 

Donahoe played No. 1 for 
UCSD all four years and was doc-
umented as a preseason AIl-
American-an accolade that only 
three players in the Western divi-
sion held. His accomplishments 
make him quite a good candidate 
for the UCSD Hall of Fame. 

Donahoe did not just play golf 
all his life. He was a basketball 
player for Hemet High for four 
years but chose to play golf in 
college due to his success at the 
course in Temecula, one known 
to be particularly tough and 
menacing. There, he shot an 
amazing 69 as a high school 

senior, and his accolades were 
well-documented. Wydra put it 
best when he said, "I am just glad 
James didn't choose a Division I 
school; he has been a remarkable 
player for UCSD.w 

Another of his accomplish-
ments was at the Southern 
California Intercollegiate 
Championships, a tournament 
that puts both scholarship and 
nonscholarship students into one 
tournament. Donahoe won the 
tournament an astonishing three 
times and has his name a few 
spots away on the winner's trophy 
of another amazing golfer: TIger 
Woods. 

A lot of credit should go to 
Donahoe's parents for being so 
supportive over the years. His par-
ents made 13 cross-country trips 
to support Donahoe in his tour-
!laments. and they were rewarded 
as being part of a select few to be 
inducted into the Spectating Hall 
of Fame. 

Vanderpool came from Torrey 
Pines High School and became 
the eigth man on the Triton team. 
This 5'8 w senior began golf at a 
later age than Donahoe but 
proved to be a strong asset for the 
Tritons. He has been a letter 
award-winner for three years and 
was selected to play in the Rolex 
College Math Play 
Championships in Florida during 
his senior season, where an inter-
esting event occurred. 

"My coach, Mike Wydra, told 
me a trick to try in my afternoon 
match,W Vanderpool said. "He told 
me to get all set to tee off and then 
tum to the gallery and proclaim 
'everybody hang on to something 
... this one's goipg for a ridel' then

RealiW 
Check 
My TlDle as Guardian 
Sports Editor 
Iy-.a._ 

This is definitely the hardest 
edition of "Reality Check" that I 
have had to write this year. This will 
be my laSI article as the sports edi-
tor of the Guardian, and I feel like I 
have to write something that will 
sum up the entire year in a concise 
fashion . Although I am not the king 
of brevity, I will give it my best shot. 

It has been great writing for all 
the readers of the Guardian this 
year. Sometimes I will be sitting in 
class and see somebody reading 
something I wrote. and it will make 
me feel like all the work my fellow 
writers and I have put in is all 
worthwhile. At the risk of sounding 
sappy, and I know that is a big 
departure from my usual writini 
style. entertaining and informing 
you guys was my job, and when I 
did my job well , I felt fulfilled. 
. I know I have been hard on you 
guys from time to time this year. 
One of my friends came up to me 
at a party a couple of weeks ago 
and commented on an article in 
which I berated all of you for nOt 
coming out to UCSD sporting 
events. He was pretty ticked and 
said I should just layoff and allow 
everybody to do what makes them 
happy. What I have been trying to 
do, and what I will continue to 
attempt to do, is to help you guys 
find a way to be happy. 

When I listen to the sentiments 
of average UCSD students, I usually

Guardian Sports Chooses Athletes of the Year 
jennifer Watanabe of the women's swimming team and Ross Mecham of the men's water polo squad dominated their sports 

WOIII8n that, she was a member of the Honorable 
800-meter freestyle relay 

Jennifer Watanabe, a star on 
the women's swimming team, is 
the GIMIt'di4n Female Athlete of 
the Year. 

Watanabe had an excellent 
~ season, but it was ner 
postseason victories that put 
her ahead of other skilled lHton 
athletes. 

At the NCAA Division III 
Championships in Atlanta, 
Ga., Watanabe showed no but-
terflies on the big stage. She 
stepped up and captured three 
individual titles. Watanabe was 
tops in the 500-meter 
freestyle, the 400-meter indi-
vidual medley and the 200-
meter backstroke. On top of 

Men 
Men's water polo's Ross 

Mecham is the Guardian Male 
Athlete of the Year. 

There is little that Mecham 
has not done in his four years 
at UCSD. He has played four 
seasons and led his team in 
almost every offensive category 
for the last two. On the defen-
sive side, he has shut down the 
opponents' two-meter man like 
very few other defenders in the 
country. In 1998, he led the 
Tritons to a third-place finish . 
in the Open Division Water 
Polo Championships. and he 
again helped the Tritons to 
appear at that even,t the pinna-
cle tournament of the season 
this year. 

squad that took first at nation- Mention 
als. Her time of 4:55.48 in the 
500 freestyle was an NCAA 
record and she was named the 
NCAA Swimmer of the Year. 

One other thing - .she is 
only a freshman, making future 
prospects exciting for the swim 
team as she grows into a leader 

Watanabe dominated her 
sport like few others, winning 
almost every event she 
entered, reaching the pinnacle 
her first year. This proves scary 
for competition in the years to 
come as she improves and 
matures with more hours in 
the pool. Her future is indeed 
bright. . 

There were many worthy 
athletes for the award this year, 
but what sets Mecham apart 
from the others is his ability to 
perform at such a high level 
against the toughest competi-
tion in the country. In men's 
water polo there are no divi-
sions. SO for Mecham and his 
team to be successful they had 
to play against the toughest 
teams In the nation. 

Mecham led the nitons to a 
top-10 ranking this season. Any 
team in the country would have 
loved to have had Mecham's 
services the last four years, but 
it was Head Coach Denny 
Harper's UCSD squad that was 
given the honor. Mecham is 
easily one of the to~ athletes 
ever to have particIpated in 
UCSD Athletics. 

Carolyn Jones (Women~ Tradr.): 
Jones, as a freshman capped a fantas-
tic year by winning the CCAA title in 
the 3,OOO-meter race. 

Amy Tranckino (Women's 
Tennis): Thmckino made it as far as 
the semifinals at nationals in the sin-

San Diego's Nightlife Sizzles With Salsa 
Salsa culture thrives in San Diego, complete with its own language and etiquette 
By ILONAFAU 
Staff Writer 

Last Thursday the king of 
mambo Tito Puente passed away. 
In homage to Puente's contribu-
tion throughout the Latin Ameri-
can music world, the Guardian 
takes a look at how salsa first 
began, and key players in San 
Diego's own thriving salsa scene. 
TIle Fu8loft of Hlp Hop .... 
..... 

More than just a seductive 
mode of self-expression, salsa is a 
culture complete with its own lan-
guage, nuances and etiquette. It is 
also a dance that is contin ually 
redefining itself. . 

"In street-style salsa, you're 
allowed to do whatever you want," 
said David Stein, local dance 
instructor and club regular. 
"There's not very much technique, . 
which is why there are so many dif-
ferent styles." 

.Stein:s unique style of incorpo-
raong hlp hop and break dancing 
with traditional Latin motion is a 
good example of salsa's continual 
evolution. 

"Salsa is almost like hip hop, 
but you get to dance it with some-
body else," Stein said. 

This May, Stein teamed up with 
partners Stephan Gallardo and 
Josie Velasco to create Salsa y 
Fuego Productions, a company 
that encompasses dancing, teach-
ing and choreography, and whose 
ultimate goal is to have a dance 
team that will compete worldwide. 

Velasco and Gallardo met about 
a year-and-a-half ago when they 
trained at Dance With Me Acade-
my. When Gallardo left the studio 
for a fu\\-time lob in computer net-
working, Stein and Velasco began 
performing and competing togeth-
er on a regular basis. 

A few months later Velasco and 
Stein teamed up again with Gallar-
do to form a partnership. 

Working in harmony both on 
and off the dance floor. it is easy to 
see why the three young partners 
are so successful. 

"Stephan brings a lot more foot 
patterns and in general a lot more 
knowledge of the steps to dance," 
Stein said. "My particular style 
adds funk to the group. I like to 
invent moves and do things that 
are a little bit different, and Josie is 
definitely the business part of it.· 

To those who worry that they just 
weren't put on this earth to dance, 
Stein says, "Some are faster and bet-
ter than others. but I've never taught 

a person who couldn't learn." 
.............. of ..... 

The actual origin of salsa is 
controversial, and the word salsa is 
the generic term given to rhythms 
whose predecessors stem from 
Cuban music, Guaracha, Mambo, 
Montuno, Puerto Rican music 
such as Jibara. La Bamba, Seis Por 
Ocho, North American Jazz and 
African rhythms. 

"Around the 1970s salsa hit big 
in New York and basically replaced 
mambo, which had previously 
repl;:ced cha cha cha," said Jose F. 
Bello, a dance instructor at Cafe

Sevilla. Bello also said that the 
Cuban immigrants living in New 
York were the key founders of 
salsa. 

"Then in the 1980s salsa hit a 
depression, and what happened 
was that the sryle completely 
changed - it became much more 
romantic. The words were more 
erotic and more refined, and they 
talked exclusively about love," 
Bello said. 

In the 1990s salsa reemerged 
and is now embraced by Middle 
Easterners, Asians, Cubans, Puerto 
Ricans, Americans and Canadians. 

"What's good about salsa is that 
it's colorblind; Bello said. "If it 
wasn't for black music, we would-
n't have salsa." 

Bello explained that as salsa 
evolved, the emphasis switched 
from instrumental improvisation, 
or "descarga" in Spanish, to the 
meaning of the lyrics. 

Just as regions affect languages, 
different dialects are seen on the 
dance floor. 

"Dancing in Columbia, there is 
a difference between people from 
Medellin and Cali, the best salsa 
dancers in Columbia: Bello said. 

Compared to salsa giants Los 
Angeles and New York, San Diego 
is still a baby. L.A. style, which 
Bello calls "Hollywood style: is 
flashier, more staccato artd linear, 
while New York style is more fluid 
and circular in motion.

Will the Real Sun God Please Stand Up 
A redeeming night finds Jurassic 5 surpassing Sun God's lineup ' 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Associated Students of 
UCSD issued an informal apology 
for Sun God 2000 in the foml of a 
TGIO ("Thank Goodness It's 
Over") concert at the Price Center 
Plaza last Friday night. The mes-
sage was delivered by Pato Banton, 
Supernatural and Jurassic 5, who 
took turns delighting the crowd 
with new, varied styles that paid 
tribute to music's old school. 

Pato Banton and the Reggae 
Revolution, who fifth-year seniors 
may fondly remember as the first 
performance they saw at UCSD, 
started the festivities with a lengthy 
act that could have easily doubled 
as t.he marquee show. Birmingham 
native Banton mixed political mes-
sages ("Legalize it") with delicious 
dub ("Bubbling Hot"), and fol-
lowed up with an energetic version 
of "Don't Sniff Coke" that left the 
masses feeling Irie. 

After the clouds of smoke 
cleared, the highlight of the 
evening came somewhat unexpect-
edly when freestyle fanatic Super-
natural hypnotized the crowd with 
a short improvisational set that 
provided the perfect bridge 

To finish his 
performance, 
Supernatural hid his 
head under a towel. 
Each time he removed it 
he transformed into a 
different rapper. 
between_ &anton 's mellow grooves 
and Ju!assic 5's party anthems. 

Perhaps taking a cue from 
"Whose Line is it Anyway?" he 
first concocted a rhyme out of 
words suggested by the audience, 
including "toenail clippers· and 

"abstract." 
Supernatural then demonstrat-

ed his true talent by asking audi-
ence members to hand him any-
thing in their pockets. As he 
rrceived the objects, he incorporat-
ed them into his frenzied rap. 
Among the random items, a box of 
Altoids and a coupon for Subway 
both made appearances, which 
kept the crowd guessing as to what 
he would say next. 

To ijnish his performance, 
Supernatural hid his head under a

While hiS Impersonations of such 
artists as Big Punisher and Jurassic 
5's own Charlie Thna left some-
thing to be desired, he managed to 
work an apology into his rhyme

By u.uv lWOIIIIU ... 
IINCOOIl 
Associate Hlstus Editor 
and Contributing Histus Writer 

I thought rock 'n' roll was dead. 
After Sonic Youth, I just knew it 
was all over. I was content with my 
used CDs, knowing I would never 
seeJimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton in 
live performance. (Of course, I am 
referring to Clapton when he was 
younger and still rocked.) Elec-
tronic beats, industrial doom and 
self-mocking, intellectual indie-
rock are the future, right? 

of organization. Most songs on 
the playlist make some reference 
to the loneliness of youthful 
searching and painful blows of 
fate. Their songs are organized so 
as to tell an often intimate story 
about growing up and, according 
to the Chlorine Cowboys, growing 
up is tragic. 

The antagonist in this personal 
tragedy is fate. The storyteller is 
struck down by events outside of 
his control. Fate steps in and 
derails the train he is nding home 
to see his girl, or whips up a storm 
to keep him from happiness. Noth-

ing can go well. Well, Billy Mid-
night and the Chlo-
rine Cowboys beg 
to differ. They are 
local folks who still 
know how to get a 
divebar full of half-
drunken people 
hootin', hollerin' 
and dancin' . They 
remind fans of their 
younger brothers' 
garage band and 
the rising stars of a 
golden era when 
down-home, 
groovy music still 

They remind fans of 
their younger 
brothers' garage 
band' and the rising 
stars of a golden era 
when down-home, 
groo'l!)' music still 
strummed on the 
nation 5 heartstrings. 

The tragedy has 
another important 
element. We see 
the storyteller as a 
misfit. sentenced to 
a life of alienation. 
It seems the story-
teller's self-image .is 
that of a destruc-
tive anti-hero. In 
this way, the story-
teller's self-image 
becomes a self-ful-
filling prophecy 
that gravitates him 
toward an inescap-

strummed on the nation's heart-
strings. Basically, they rock. 

The members of the band are 
brothers Billy Shaddox (guitar and 
vocals) and Bobby Shaddox 
(drums and vocals), and buddy 
Phil Varela (bass and vocals). The 
group came together when 
Sasquatch band members Billy and 
Bobby opened for Varela's band, 
Beergarden. It was only some 
months later at a hole in the wall 
called .Joe and Andy's Hole in the 
Wall that the three had their first 
drunken jam. 

In a live performance. one can see 
obvious improvements on the 
group's first album, "Live at the 
1tade Winds," which is not. in fact, a 
recording of a live performance. 
While the album is a fine production, 
the trio has come a long way in a 
short time in tmns of tcchniaI skill 
and enetKY ~ or perhaps it is simply 
the thriU of performing lift that gives 
their music an extra punch. 

The three-piece group is grow-
ing tighter every day. Bilty is rearn-
ing how to make love to his guitar, 
Varela is becoming smoother than 
butter on the bass, and Bobby is 

. getting ever better at screaming out 
harmonies and wailing on his 
drum set at the same time. 

In addition to skill, these boys 
have that special something - a 
strange performance energy that 
drives innocent listener: to let their 
hair loose, wiggle their limbs and 
shake their tushes. 

Despite the band members' 
youth, it appears they have had 
the maturity to produce an album 
with a distinct theme and method 

able place in life. 
Though the mood of the album 

is a dark one, the personal effect of 
listening to it can be consoling if ~u 
relate to the characters. or downright 
fun if you ftellike letting go into the 
groove of the bluesy tunes. The lis-
tener gets the fteIin~ that the album 
is a process of growth, that points to 
a hopeful future. 

Like true rock 'n' roUers, Billy 
Midnighr and the Chlorine Cow-
boys understand there would be no 
rock without the blues. They incor-
porate the time-tested American 
traditions of blues and country with 
their own pmonal twist to reach 
their musical message. 

Billy named bluegrass as a 
major influence of his music, and 
said that his father began teaching 
him the style when he was in ele-
mentary school. Later, he played in 
a bluegrass group with his grandfa-

·ther and friends. 
Overall, Billy Midnight and the 

Chlorine Cowboys art well round-
ed. Sometimes the songs are ten-
der, sometimes sarcastically comi-
cal, and maybe, like their indie-
rocker contemporaries, a little self-
mocking - but always in the con-
text of real, down-home, good 01' 
American rock 'n' roll .

Cowboy: Ire playing this Sunday, 
June 11, ~ . ,lind Mdon's, 710 Gar-

B4 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 8, 2000 

MarcComer 
Last week. after three-and-a-half years 

of servitude to the Guardian. only two 
weeks before the end of my tenn as editor 
in chief, I nearly quit .. . I nearly repudiated 
the only religion I worship: journalism. 
While it may seem ridiculous to nonjour-
nalists, journalism is a religion. and at 
UCSD, the Guardian is the only church. 

In the religion of journalism, there is 
even a Bible of sorts called "The AP Style-
book.· It's filled with journalistic laws, and 
while most don 't read it before they go to 
bed, true journalists, true believers, follow 
it very closely. It is, however, the unwritten 
laws that create the foundation of any reli-
gion , and in journalism there are many. 

Most are based on principles of truth 
and honesty and fairness. and like the Ten 

WaltDickinson 

Commandments, 
breaking these rules 
will send you direct-
ly to journalism hell. 

Among these 
commandments is 
the concept of The 
Wall. At every rep-
utable, journalistic 
publication in the 
world there is The 
Wall, a separation 
between good and 
evil, between the 
editorial side of the 
newspaper and the 
business side. 

It is The Wall that 
was broken down in 
the Los Angtlts 
7imts-Staples Cen-

ter scandal. It is The Wall that keeps the 
lines between advertising and reporting 
from blurring. It is The Wall that keeps 
newspapers credible sources of informa-
tion, and that's what sells. 

So why did I almost quit? 
I won't go into great detail. but the edi-

tors at the Guardian were faced with a seri-
ous ethical question: Should the business 
side be separate from the editorial side of 
the newspaper ... should there be a Wall ... 
should one of the fundamental laws of 
journalism be upheld? The editors, 
although only one vote shy of upholding 
the unwritten rule, voted no. 

To me, it was a slap in the face; my 
blood boiled at such sacrilege. Years of 
proselytizing were diminished by one blas-

You would think that writing a final 

anicle as a graduating senior would be 
pretty simple. After all, I have four years 
of experience with which to work (and 
that's just me - some lucky individuals 
have five or six years of bhssful college 
memories to draw from) . Taking the 

.essence of these past 12 quaners (and 
one summer session) and cramming 
them into one little article should be no 
problem at all . If anything. I should have 
way too much material. This article has 
indeed, however. been a problem for me. 

The real problem is that these have 
been my four years of college. 

They've been the greatest time o( my 
life, but how can I explain that to other 
people and make them care? Is anyone 
else going to be able to relate to my sto-
ries about how three of my friends and t 
once stole 15 street signs in one night, or 
the time we had to visit a. drug lord's 
estate in Puerto Nuevo to get my friend's 
wallet back. or about all the parodies of 
those stupid little orange signs we pasted 
up all over campus? 

As much as I would like to think that I 

The UCSD Guardian SUMMER 8' GRADUATION SPECIAL BS 

have some inter-
esting stories. I still 
have to accept the 
fact that not every-
one is going . t~ 
share this view. 
Besides, the statute 
of limitations for 
certain events has-
n't passed yet. 

That leaves me 
with the only other 
thing I'm really left 
with to share: 
advice. I know this 
sounds horrible, 
and I know people 
don't want to hear a 
lot of dire warnings 
from a tired 22-
year-old, so I'm not 

going to give any advice about what not to 
do. 

The most fun you have in college 
stems from making your own mistakes 
and learning from them. You're going to 
have to learn on your own how many 
shots of tequila you can mix with the beer 
you've already drunk before you puke. 
You're going to have to learn which 
spaces on campus you can't get away with 
parking illegally in on your own. You're 
going to have to learn what not to say to 
the RAslCSOslcops that come banging 
on your dorm/apartment/house door 
when you have 100 drunk and noisy 
friends over on your own. 

I'm not going to tell you the things I 
wish I hadn't done because in all likeli-
hood you won't listen to me anyway. I'll 
just tell you the things that I wish that 
people had told me earlier. That way you 
all will hopefully be able to go out and 
make bigger and badder mistakes than I 
ever did, and learn even more and have 
even more fun than I did.

I think it's ironic that as I sit down to 

write my ~senior farewell" column, my 
mind draws an utter and complete blank. 
So much has happened in my five years 
at UCSD that I don't even know where 
to begin. I look back at how much I have 
grown since my freshman year. and it 
amazes me. I have learned so many 
lessons at UCSD, most of them outside 
of the classroom, and many of them 
learned the hard way. 

Through it all. as I look back at my 
undergraduate experience, I feel that I 
have been extremely fortunate. I have 
received from my parents undying sup-
pon; I have found incredible friends 
(Sarah and Claire!); and I have found my 
passion in photojournalism. 

When I first set foot in the Guardian 
the summer after my freshman year. I 
had no idea what was to unfold. I walked 
into what was (and, by the way. still is) 
the ugliest office I have ever seen (and for 
that matter ever hope to see) in my life, 
thinking that this would just be a sum-
mer job in the business office. Now, four 
years later, it was the Guardian that really 

has come to 
define much of 
my college expe-
rience. It's a hard 
phenomenon to 
explain , but !'VI: 
witnessed it tn 
many other peo-
ple. Pt'ople come 
into thi s office 
and tt beC0 I11 \.'5 
home. 

So many peo-
pic leave college 
without ever 
rea lly discover-
ing their passton. 
That's why I feci 
so fo rtunate in 
havi ng found 
l11i ne. My cxpe-

rience at the Guardian gave m\.' the means 
and the forum to develop my photo-
graphic eye. 

Photojournalism is what keeps IIlC 
going. It has taken me so many places 
that I otherwise would never have set:n. 
It has taken me down on the fie ld to 
photograph professional baseball games; 
it has taken me to the Bay area to docu-
ment the lives of prostitutes; and it has 
taken me beyond the screaming night 
clubs of Avenida Revoluci6n to make 
pictures of people's lives. 

Having worked at the Guardwn for 
four years, I have seen many editors 
come and go. I have read many of these 
farewell columns, and they are always 
filled with such impressive postgradua-
tion plans. 

As for myself, I will honestly confess 
that I have no plans. That is, plans aside 
from sitting on the beach and of course 
shooting photos. Come June 17, it will all 
be over, and I will be left, poli set degree 
in hand, to fend for myself 111 the real

During the fall of my freshman year, 

Madeleine Albright became the first 
female secretary of state, and I was con-
vinced that this was a news story on par 
with Neil Armstrong landing on the 
moon. 

However, much to my amazement, 
weeks passed by and the GuardUrn failed to 
run a story on this historic achievement. I 
was livid. 

~What is the matter with these peo-
ple?" I thought to myself. "Where's

designing and pushed on at six in . 
the morning after 20 hours of 
agony. Julia and I once stayed up 
for 72 hours getting the first issue 
fin ished, took a quick four-hour 
nap at the Guardian (I slept on the 
short, orange, chiropractic bench 
in the Hiatus office) and then 
pushed on for 12 hours more. Jeff 
Barker, Bill and Vince wrote entire 
sections alone. Walt, exhausted and 
overworked, slept on the printer ... 
and on many occasions, in a filthy 
chair with nails hanging out of it. 
The Guardian upset the KoaItJ edi-
tors at their own game, sloshball. 

The university has given me 
many things. but the greatest (and 
cheapest) is the Guardian. I've 
learned a lot from the Guarditm, 
much more than I ever could have 
from the courses at UCSD. The 
GuardUrn has been like a father to 
me, and while the editors at the 
Guardian, my colleagues, my 
friends, may choose their own reli-
gions and go separate paths, the 
Guardian wiD always bind us. You're 
all believers, and I love you. 

Even if you are a bunch of terri-
ble monkeys. 

Walt: 
Final words of wisdom 
from the Bitter Old Man 
names still manage to escape me, 
thanks for putting up with me and 
my uncontrollable, selective mem-
ory. 

I'll miss virtually everyone I had 
the pleasure of working with at the 
Guardian over the past five years, 
and, of course, my fellow visual 
arts majors, some of whose work 
outshined mine and impressed 
me, some of whose work paled in 
comparison and made my stuff 
look better. 

I must also mention Craig 
Ashby, Mark Dagget and Megan 
Cunningham for being the best 
parts of the visual arts department 
and for being the most talented 
and helpful people working for 
UCSD. 

And last on my list but foremost

Finally, I got up 

the courage to con-
tact the opinion 
editor and t<> . 
request that some-
one please cover my 
hero's appointment

The opinion editor 
informed me that 
unless I was willing 
to write the story, 
he could pretty 
much guarantee 
that nothing would 
be printed about 
her. 

So, I sharpened 
my number two 
pencils and sat 

down to write my article. After working all

article to the opinion editor. 

Yet, much to my dismay, weeks went by 
without him ever calling me. 

Finally, I went into the office to talk to 
him. When he failed to show up, I wound 
up talking to the news editor, who con-
vinced me to become the next A.S. 
reporter. By the end of the school year, I

Review 

NicholasRunco 
It fttIs so good to be writing these words. 
I remember watching previous 

GuardUrn folk writing these last minute 
notes and thinking. "I wonder what it 
feels like to be graduating?" Well, it feels 
absolutely wonderful. 

To me. it's like you've got a car that's 
treated you well for four years, but doesn't 
have that same shine. The engine. that was 
a helluva lot better than your previous car, 
just can't go as fast as you want it to. The 
smell that was somewhat humorous before 

is just annoying 
now. Now, when 
you meet some girl 
at a bar, you don't 
want to tell her you 
still drive it, because 
while before it gav!:: 
you character, now 
it just seems ado-
lescent. 

Graduation is 
like your new car 
- it's a fresh start. 
It can take you to 
new places and you 
don't need your 
parents to fill up 
the tank. (Allhough 
it would help, Dad 
... a lot.) 

I don't mean to 
bad-mouth my four years at UCSD; just 
lik.e I'm sure I didn't mean to bad-mouth 
high school four years ago, even though I 
had every right to. Truthfully, in all my time 
here I have done more things than I ever 
could have imagined. I have met people I 
will not soon forget (including three incred-
ible friends I will have until I die). I have 
learned and grown so much that I consider 
myself a completely different person.

To the Gllardiiln staff. some of the most 

amazing people I know: When I started as 
a news reporter for the Guardian four years 
ago, I never imagined that the paper would 
come to mean so much to me as it has this 
year. As bizarre as it may sound to some of 
you, I have actually enjoyed spending time 
in the office this year, probably because of 
all of you. 

Each of you has taught me so much, 
and I, in return, hope that I have been able 
to give something to you. I love and 
admire each of you for your personality 
and incredible talents. It is unbelievable 
that sllch a diverse and eclectic group of 
students such as ourselves can come 
together for a common goal - to create a 
newspaper tWice a week. So, my co-work-
ers who have also become my friends, this 
is for you. 

Marc: A wonderful confidante. You are 
the editing guru. Thank you for listening, 
adviSing and sharing of yourself. Your 
strong work eth ic, principle and intelli-
gence guarantee success in anything you 
pursue. YOll know, we still need to make 

sushi for everyone. 
Julia: My fellow 

Laker fanatic. Thank 
you for the late-
night dinner runs to 
Ralph's. Having you 
th ere always made 
things seem better. 
Your diplomatic and 
tactful nature served 
the Guardian well 
and will serve you 
well in the future. 
Go Lakers - our

Alison: You are 
one of the few peo-
ple I know who is 
beautiful inside and 
out. I respect your 
dedication, maturity 

and kindness. We are bonded in our love 
for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Taco 
Bell (even at 2 a.m.!). I have full confidence 
in your abilities as I turn my role of man-
aging editor over to you. 

Jenny: You are the computer and net-
work god. I am forever indebted to you. 
Thank you for lOOking out for me when I 
didn 't know how to look out for myself.

section nearly all by yourself this year with

you will be a fabulous editor in chief next 
year. 

Brent: First and foremost, I must 
remind you that you are a pimp. That said, 
thank you for always being on time with 
your section this year. You made my job so 
easy. Your sly wit has kept me in stitches 
this year. I look forward to watching your

Ward: Thank you for your patience this 
year. You are a real trooper. Although I 
could never tell if you were joking or being 
serious, thanks for all the crazy one-liners 
this past year. Best of luck as you transfer 
to Berkeley; the Guardian will miss you 
next year. 

Bill : How did the sports section get out 
on time nearly every issue? This is 
unheard of, but you managed to do it. 
Even when dealing with crazy things and 
crazy people this year, you kept a cool head 
and a sense of humor. With these traits, 
you will only see success as you assume 
my role of managing editor next year. Take 
good care of the staff. 

Robert: You are the Beatles guru. I'm so 
glad you joined the Guardian this year. 
Your writing and dedication to production 
have improved an already impressive 
sports section. Thank you for always say-
ing hi and taking the time to chat. It makes 
a bigger difference than you may think. 
Good luck with the sportS section next 
year and be sure to find help. 

Jessica : You are one cool cat. Can you 
believe nearly four years of this and now, 
it's almost over? I don't know how you 
maintained your grace, perseverance and 
love for features through troubled times, 
but I admire you for it. Thank you for car-
ing about others and striving to do wht 
you know to bt. right. I'm jealous that you 
get to live in my apartment next year! 

Josh : Next year, you will be the first 
male features editor in as long as I can 
remember. As evidenced by your work this 
year, I know that you will be an awesome 
editor. Thank you for being so agreeable; I 
think you are the only person on staff who 
hasn't disagreed with me this entire year. 
Good luck with everything. 

David: We shared a sunrise at the 
Guardian office and so much more. You are 
a truly special person, and I value you for 

how you make others see themselves. As 
perceptive and thoughtful as you are, I 
have no doubt that you will continue to 
touch all those you meet. I'm not going to 
let you forget your offer and may even take 
you up on it someday. 

Lindsay: ( have always enjoyed working 
with you, my fellow Thousand Oaks 
buddy, especially because you know how 
to take things seriously but not too seri-
ously. Thank you for sharing your knowl-
edge with me. Have fun with hiatus next 
year. 

Walt: We were so happy to turn design 
over to your capable hands this year. 
Thank you for stepping in when you were 
most needed. You are truly talented, yet 
modest. Your eye for design will be an 
liset in any future job. Great work with 
the Sun God festival artwork this year and 
thanks for coming to .my party. 

Lisa: I must say, you are one of the 
toughest girls I know, and I think you are 
so cool. As a photographer, you rock. 
Thank you for all the laughs and support 
through the Beatles class and for all the 
late night chats while doing payroll on 
Thursdays. Your stories never cease to 
amaze, entertain and educate me. I wish 
you the best of luck and hope you find 
what you are looking for in all aspects of 
life. 

Dave: Though I haven 't gotten to know 
you very well, I do know that I have full 
confidence in your ability as a great photo 
editor next year. Not only do you know 
how to take the shots, you have a sincerity 
and dedication that bode well for the 
Guardian. Take care and have fun next year. 

Nick: You are the eternal party host and 
my "Fridays at the Pub" buddy. Th~nk' you 
for encouraging staff bonding this year. 
Your artistic talent is unique and amazing 
- the Guardian was certainly fortunate to 
be graced by your talent these past few

meet up in Italy this summer. 

Brian: You are the quintessential 
Web guy. Thank rou for driving to 
Vegas and for Iettmg me doze off in

luck next year with whatever you 
choose to do. 

Pamela: You are my true partner 
in crime. Thanlt you so much for 
working on payroll with me and

al as business manager for the 
GUQI'dian this year, and I know that 
there will be only more greatness 
from you in the year ahead. Your 
level-headedness, caring nature 
and firmness make you a role 
model for mt and others as well. 
Thank you for beinJ so wonderful. 

Mike: I apoloiize for all the 
ways in which we have made your 
jolr harder this past year. Thank 
you for your patience. The 
GUQI'diarI will truly be at a loss with-
out your talents and experiences 
next year; best of luck with your 
future. You deserve o~ the best. 

Man: I never imal'ned that a 
guy from Indiana would be so cool. 
You are so much fun - I always 
enjoy hearing all your weekend 
pany stories. You certainly know 
how to live it up. Moreover, you arc 
a completely amazing and phe-
nomenal ad manager, having far 
surpassed any and all goals that 
were set for this year. Thanks for 
the sushi experience (we should do 
it again) and I'm sorry in advance if 
the Lalters crush the Pacers in the 
finals. 

Yvette: You have been a smiling 
presence at tIx GIIIJI'IIitm for as long 
as I have been there. I can't imagine

you find someone to sit with) and 
best wishes for a wonderful future. 

Joe: You are an amazing guitar

I wish someone had told me the 
food on campus was so crappy 
before my freshman year. I wasted 
$800 per quarter on overpriced slop 
before I moved on up to cooking for 
myself when I tived in the on-cam-
pus apartments my seoond year. 

Good food is one of the best 
things you can share with your 
friends, and there just simply isn't 
any good food to be shared that 
can be bought with meal points. If 
you know how to cook, plan din-
ners with your friends. If you don't 
know how to cook, find some 
friends who do and offer to help 
them pre~ a dinner. 

I wish someone had told me 
sooner that there arc far better 
places to go in Mexico than Tijua-
na. Tijuana is the worst, trashiest 
club scene on the face of the plan-
et, and the sooner you figure that 
out, the better. The worst part of it 
is that there arc plenty of great 
plica to drink and go crazy in 
Mexico, you just have to drive a tit-
tle bit farther past the border than 
the black hole of sleaze that is Tj. 

I wish someone would have 
told me that science isn't the cen-
ter of the universe. At UCSD there 
is a mind-set that if you're not

much about what is to come next. 

SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL 89 

taking a major that has an "engi-
neering" or "tech" slapped onto 
the end, you're never going to do 

anythin~ cool. I didn't figure out 
that thts was bullshit until my 
sophomore year, and by then I 
had to scramble to salvage what 
classes I could so that I could 
graduate in four years with a 
degree in something I would actu-
ally enjoy pursuing as a career. 

If we want UCSD to gain pres-
tige, we need more writers, artists 
and musicians at this campus, and 
more serious attention to the 
departments that cater to these 
daring souls. Otherwise, UCSD is 
going to tum into the lIT Tech of 
the UC system, and everyone else 
in the state is going to sn icker and 
laugh at us behind our backs. 

I wish someone would have 
told me how much the university 
despises the Greek system so that 
I could have joined a fraternity 
earlier. Anything that the stifling, 
anti-social powers-that-be oppose 
so vehemently has to have some 
great socially redeeming qualities 
~ and it did, at least for me. 

At a lot of schools, the Greek 
system is where people go to fit in. 
At some schools on the East Coast. 
80 percent of the student popula-
tion belongs to a fraternity or 
sorority. A lot of people mistakenly 
any that image over to UCSD, 
where it really doesn't apply. In a 
way, I'm glad the Greek system is 
such a minority at this. school, 

With so much uncertainty 
ahead, there is one thing I am sure 
of: No matter what it is ( end up 
doing. it will not involve sitting in a 
cubicle, staring at a computer 
screen or waiting bleary-eyed for 
5:30 p.m. to roll around, the way 
that so many liberal arts majors do. 

The biggest challenge of being 
photo editor at the Guardian has 
always been in getting a room full 
of writers to understand that pic-

because it means that the people 
who do participate do so because 
they really want to be there, not just 
out of some residual high school 
delusions about the importance of 
popularity and peer pressure. 

I wish someone had told me 
that it was so easy to get involved 
on campus. For a long time I was-
n't very impressed with the 
Guardian, until I finally decided to 
actually do something about it 
and start writing for it. 

I won't presume to pass judg-
ment on whether my effortS have 
actually had an impact on the qual-
ity of the paper, but personally it 
was a lot more satisfying than just 
sitting on the sidelines and saying 
"I could do better than that." 

If you don't like an institution, 
whether it be an organization, a 
company or a government, join up 
and bring it down from the inside. 
Hey, if they were foolish enough 
to let me be an editor of this 
paper, anything is possible. 

I'm far from the final authority 
on the subject of college life. If 
you still have a couple years left 
here at UCSD, go out and find 
some upperclassmen and learn 
from their experiences. If you're 
almost out of here like me, take 
the time to pass on a little of what 
you've learned to those who will 
follow behind - and all of you, 
young and old, continue to make 
stupid mistakes, because that 's the 
best fun life has to offer. 

tures so often say more than words. 
To Dave, my successor, I wish 

you the best of luck for next year 
and beyond. I have witnessed your 
passion for photography, and as 
long as that is what drives you, I 
know you will succeed. My only 
advice is that you stand up for 
yourself, demand that your photos 
run big, don't ever let anyone ';rop 
your work, and kick ass if they 
mess up your photo credits.

Jurassic: 
Rap group shows signs of

Colla .... ".. ,... a 
recently, the marquee act Jurassic 5 
did not disappoint, but kept the 
energy level high, with a set so 
closely resembling a house party 
that the only people missing were 
Kid and Play. 

Jurassic 5 opened by launching 
into their popular "Concrete 
Schoolyard: which showcased 
catchy harmonies and a pass-the-
mic style reminiscent of the days 
when Run OMC and The Fat Boys 
ruled the radio. 

Although their performance 
was more predictable Plan Super-
natunl's flexible spontaneity,Juns-
sic 5 did show signs of life, such as 
their brid interlude with kazoos. 
Still, the polish paid off as Junssic 
5 won over concertgocrs with ren-
ditions of favorites such as "In the 
Flesh,- "Action Satisfaction" and 
their new track, "Quality Control." 

Jurassic 5's OJ Cut Chemist 
showed why he is often mentioned 
in the same breath as OJ Shador 
by leading an enchanting intermi4-
slon of sonic tweaking as he al1l 
fellow Jurassic 5 OJ Nu-Mark took 
turns spinning records. 

To top the night off, Jurassic 5 
encored with a spirited version of 
"Unified Rebellion, - and a freestyle 
session' for anyone who could get 
his hands oft a microphone. 

As was obvious by the huge 
ninth-week turnout, the students 
were grateful to A.S. for an excel-
lent, well-executed concert. The 
fact that the bands have all had hit 
songs within the last five years did-
n't hurt either.

had been elected co-news editor. 

My article eventually ran, but 
by the time it did, I had become 
too involved in the Guardian to 
really reflect on the fact that I had 
achieved my goal. 

Instead, ( became obsessed 
with writing news stories that my 
editor would like.- and making sure 
the people I interviewed (namely 
A.S. Council representatives) 
liked me and my articles. 

I realize now that I completely 
lost sight of why I came to the 
Guardian in the first place. I 
became so obsessed with pleasing 
people and getting the staff to like 
me that I completely forgot that 
my end goal was to improve the 
paper's coverage of women and 
women's issues.

I'm so excited and optimistic 
about experiencing new things on

incredible people. The idea of a 
career sounds intriguing - finding

make your mark in the world. 

I suppose it might be fair to 
call me overly optimistic. Never-
theless. it's not often I feel the 
energy that earning a diploma has 
given me. A lot of the credit is due 
to the people and events that took 
place outside of the classroom. In 
fact, about 90 percent of my edu-
cation took place in and around 
them. 

Sure. it's nice to be able to say 
that you're news editor or editor 
in chief of the school paper. but 
what docs that really mean if you 
can't pinpoint why you're there in 
the first place? 

As I diicovered this year, it 
means very little. Midway through 
the school year, I realized that 
although I really enjoyed hanging 
out with the Guardian staff mem-
bers, I no longer really enjoyed 
being part of the actual newspa-
per. I didn't know quite what had 
changed, but I knew that for the 
first time when people outside the 
Guardian complained to me about 
the paper I felt a strong urge to 
tell them that I didn't give a damn. 

MOon'i they understand how 
hard we work?" I thought to 
mySelf. "Why can't they just real-
ize that the Guardian is always 
goin~ to be an imperfect prod-

One day, I was talking to a dis-

incredible athletes, ridiculously

know they will be. 

The greatest thing is that 
though I'm graduating. [don't have 
to leave them all. After high school 
and all the keep-in-touch crap, no 
one could care less about their old 
friends. Now people aren't moving 
very far. I don't know why, but this 
time it seems like people really are 
going to keep in touch. 

I heard a spcaltcr at my older 
brother's graduation say that the 
friends you make in collcgc are the 
friends you'll have for life. I could-
n't agree more. 

I think at this point I've success-

coverage of the Cross Cultural 
Center. I told the reader that if she 
wanted something written, she 
would have to write it herself. 

Then it hit me. I had taken on 
the attitude of the opinion editor 
from my freshman year. I resigned 
myself to the fact that perhaps 
this was the attitude all Guardian 
tmployees eventually adopt. In a 
weird way, I felt like I had really, 
finally become part of the 
Guardian cynics club. 

I continued believing this until 
the day the DisrtGuardian came 
out. For those of you who don't 
know, the DisrtGuardian is the 
annual April Fool's edition of the 
paper. In all hones~, I've always 
liked the DisrtGuardian, as it gives 
the whole staff a chance to let off 
a little steam. However, I didn't 
like this year's edition one bit. It 
wasn't the stories that bother~d 
me. It was the staff box. In it, 
everyone was given fictitious posi-
tions. I was described as "She's 
Good Orally." I'd like to believe

I'm going take advantage of this 
opportunity. 

Now, in the effort of inspiring 
our readers, let me tell you what 
awaits me after college. 

rll'St, I'm going to Europe for an 
entire month. I haven't even gone 
yet, and I can already recommend 
this to all of you. Just the idea of 
leaving the country for an extended 
period' oftime makes me happy. Go 
ahead, just pretend for a second 
you have a plane ticket to France 
sining on your desk next to your 
brand-new passport (complete 
with bad photo). The mere thought 
is liberating. 

If you are worried about money, 
let me tell you this: I am quite pos-
sibly the world's most irresponsible 
consumer. I can't afford to go to 
Europe. I can't even afford more

that my co-editors were referring 
to my awesome rhetorical abili-
ties, but I know better. 

Needless to say, seeing my 
name and Mposition" in print dis-
turbed me a great deal. I felt vio-
lated and didn't know quite what 
to do. After all, I had spent my 
entire college career at the paper 
and quitting seemed inconceiv-
able. 

So, instead, I went home and 
tried to figure out a way to calm 
myself down . While sulking, I 
noticed my autographed picture 
of Albright sitting in a corner. 
When I was a freshman , my 
mother had sent Secretary 
Albright my article on her and she 
had sent me back an autographed 
picture with the inscription Myou 
will be a boon to women journal-
ists." 

Suddenly, it hit me. I knew why 
I was unhappy at the Guardian . I 
realized that my anger was not 
just the result of just the Dim-
Guardian, but instead the result of 

baby. Take my advice: Go - and 
worry about it when you get back. 
Then, you can consider your cred-
it card bill fodder for humorous 
dinner conversation. 

When I get back, I plan to freak 
the hell out because I'U be unem-
ployed and owe a bunch of people 
I don't know an !Iss-load of money. 
Then, I'll go to work. 

My brother Patrick is the great-
est graphic designer/illustrator 
ever, so it's handy that he has start-
ed a business and is on his way to 
becoming rich and famous, 
because I do graph if design, too -
and he has plenty of work to go 
around. 

Lucky? Yes. but people make 
their own luck. I have worked 
damn hard at graphic design. Soon, 
it's going to payoff. 

Hopefully, people will read this 
and realize that even an artist can 
make something happen after 

something else. 
I had come to the paper four 

years ago with the intention of 
improving the paper's coverage of 
women, and I had failed miser-
ably. I failed not because this was 
an impossible goal, but because 
somewhere along the way I con-
veniently allowed myself to forget 
it. I let my ambition and urge to 
be liked override my principles. 
This is without a doubt one of the 
biggest mistakes I've ever made. 

As I prepare for graduation, I 
know that to a certain extent I 
cannot control or predict what I 
will be doing 10 or even five years 
from now. I may be a business-
woman, a lawyer or possibly even 
a bum living in a van down by the 
river. However, I can control how 
I lead my life. I learned a very 
important lesson at the Guardian 
- that success is only fulfill ing if 
you don't forget your goals along 
the way. When I toss up my grad-
uation cap, I will be doing so with 
this lesson in mind . 

graduation. You biochemthingy-
magigger majors that have proba-
bly been to the library a lot more 
than I have shouldn't have too 
much of a problem putting some-
thing together, either. 

The truth is, this schbol has 
prepared me pretty well for the real 
world. I feel confident about dis-
cussing and evaluating art. Until a 
short time ago, it drove me nuts 
when people called themselves 
artists. I thought, Myou cocky bas-
tards, you probably aren't even any 
good'" I didn 't need UCSO to tell 
me I'm a cocky bastard. I knew that 
- but this place did help me rec-
ognize that I am an artist. 

So, this is Nicholas Runco, 
artist, world traveler, brother and 
unemployed citizen telling you that 
life can be great if you work to 
make it that way, and thank you to 
the people who helped me, you 
know who you are.

B 12 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 8, 2000 

And the Broadband Played On (, " ' \ \ ! ) : ) ,," I I 
WiredPlanet serves up free music on the right side of the law 
Senior Staff Writer 

Mark Farina is spinning in my 
computer. and nobody seems to 
mind. 

It·s been going on for hours 
now. and he still hasn't repeated a 
set. Unlike outraged record com-
panies and sue-happy Metallica. 
he is not going to file multimil-
lion dollar lawsuits against users 
who listen in. In fact. he encour-
ages it. 

Blasphemy? The end of all 
profit for musicians? Hardly. It is 
called Wired Planet www.wired-
p/ann.com. and besides pumping 
out an endless collage of delicious 
vocals ani:1 reverberating bc8ts. it 
is netcasting the future of cus-
tomizable di$ital online music. 

It·s free. It's legal. and it just 
might be the solution to this 
whole broadband mess. 

While services such as Napster 
and MP3.com arc tangled in the 
nettings of vicious legal battles 
over artist rights. WircdPlanct has 
slowly poked its head out of San 
Francisco obscurity and into the 
mainstream with its unique 
approach to providing endless 
online music that appeals to just 
about everybody. 

With its paltry 800It download 
size. which sets up stylish and 
compact desktop application. that 
means no more waiting for a 
sixty-meg deejay set to crawl 
through the modem only to dis-
cover an hour later that the con-
nection has been dropped. 

Director of Marketing Keith 
Crosley attributes the succcss of 
WiredPlanet to strong artist sup-
port. endless user customizability. 

and a foothold well within the 
boundaries of the law. 

MThe CEO Thomas Hale is an 
artist himself. so anist rights arc 
our No. 1 priority." Crosley said. 
"All artists on WircdPlanet have 
granted their consent. The labels 
often pick the songs they would 
like WircdPlanet to rotate. and 
artists have a say in what gets 
played." 

In an extreme example. the 
band They Might Be Giants -
who released their newest full 
album MLong Tall Weekend" 
exclusively online - actually run 
their own WircdPlanct radio sta-
tion. personally picking which 
songs get played and the order 
they get played in. 

Besides its unique approach to 
broadband play, what gives 
WiredPlanet an edge is the ability 
to customize the technology to 
cater to the individual. Users not 
only pick what station they want 
to listen to frocn over oM) evolving 
theme. deejay and label networks. 
but they can also personalize 
their own station and share it 
with other WiredPlanet users. 
Add to that the ability to listen to 
the station from anywhere in the 
world. and the draw of online 
music seems overpowering. 

Hownet', unlike many other 
broadband music services. the 
main draw of WurdPlanet is that 
you may have heard of these 
groups. Bands such IS the afore-
mentioned They Might Be Giants. 
Bush. Mark Farina and the leg-
mdary Paul OaItenfold all have 
their own stations, and groups 
such IS Thievery Corporation. 
Del the Funky Hor,nosapien and 
Kid Loco routinely pop up on 

. networks ranging from the laid-
back Alpha 2.0 to the jungle-
inspired Redshift to the hip-hop 
hurray stylings of The Cut. 

Crosley nota that having a 
finger on the pulse of hipness 
seems appropriate for a spvice 
devoted to changing how music is 
transmitted and shared. 

MSome of these anists are 
local. some of them arc well-
known.· Crosley said. MWith our 
theme stations, you might hear 
Macy Gray, Vitamin C and The 
Cure all in the same hour. and 
then you might hear somebody 
you've never heard before and 
like it. and now you're liskning to 
a type of music you didn't even 
know existed." 

Not conknt to sit still, WIJ'cd-
Planet is already peering into the 
future. 

"We arc producing more video 
shows. and we are working on 
syncing deejay music with pic-
tures for a more involving experi-
ence; Crosley said. 

Crosley also notes that certain 
changes will be made in the next 
two months. 

-Now that record companies 
arcn't as afraid of us as they were 
at first. you will be seeing more 
major label aets popping up on 
our stations. and in about two . 
weeks. usen will be able to 
upload their own l'avorik mp3s to 
lIIIIIIII.;'IIriw,CIIIII. where they will 
be cycled into their personal sta-
tions, • Crosley said. MSince we usc 
an algorithm that determines 
when the songs will be heard. it is
