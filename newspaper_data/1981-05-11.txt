Saturday in Balboa Park. 
The rally hosted nine other 
speakers covering topics 
from intervention in EI 
Salvador to human rights to 
draft resistance. 

By the end of the raUy less 
than one-hundred people 
remained. OrilinaUy, three-
hundred people participated 
in a march sponsored by the 
April Coalition to protest 
United States intervention 
in EI Salvador. Around 25 
UCSD students were 
present to march and listen 
to the speakers.

Bagneris, Key to-
lead 'new AS' 
Invite 'everyone' to first 
meeting Wednesday night 

From a staff writer 
The "new AS" takes office 

Wednesday night, and Jules 
Bagneris and Alma Key, who 
will be inaugurated as 
pre ident and vice-president, 
have a surprise. 

"We're inviting everyone 
to come to the meeting. and 
view the 'new AS '-
refre hments will be served, 
and this meeting is going to 
be different in that it's only 
going to be an hour long. 
That 's what we're shooting 
for from now on," Bagneris 
says. 

"The meetings are going to 
be more efficient-Alma's 
good at that. In the past 
we've had members walking 
in and out, and bringing 
alcoholic beverages to the 
meetings, a lot of things that 
doesn't bring respect to the 
AS. And we're also going to 
look into holding meetings in 
bigger places, like the 
chancellor's complex or the 
Mandeville Recital Hall," 
Bagneris says. 

This may surprise people 
who have noted that most AS 
meetings this year wouldn't 
have crowded a broom closet, 
but Bagneris is enthusiastic. 

He is already moving to 
keep some of his campaign 
promises. His administra-
tion has a budget due by the 
ninth week of this quarter, 
and he says he's looking 
especially hard at the KSDT 
and alternative media 
budgets, looking to improve 
their effectiveness. 

He is also appointing his 
commission on campus 
housing costs. . . 

"We have four members-
all students-who we are 
asking to help us out. They 
all have real estate licenses 
and they should be in in about 
two weeks," he says. 

The hassle that has 
marked the change of AS 
power this year has not 
slowed Bagneris down 
noticabley. Bagneris lost by 
28 votes in the presidential 
run-off to Joshua Harris, who 
was disqualified for over-
spending. 

He won't even talk about it. 
"I'm not going to comment 

on the so·called hassles," he 
says. "It's a sensitive issue 
for all the people involved." 

Harris ' running-mate Erik 
Singer was al 0 diSQualified 
for the violations, but lost 
badly to Key anyway. 

Harris beat Bagneris by 
only 28 votes, one of the 
closest elections in UCSD 
history, and a less than two 
percent margin. The turnout 
in that election, about 15 
percent, was also one of the 
highest for a runoff in the 
.AS's short history. 

Last year, only six percent 
showed up for the run-off..

Scripps scientists find unusual life' 
.. 'Unidentified fascinating objects' also found off Easter Island 

From UCSD News 
Geologists and geochemists photographing and 

sampling the-deep sea a few hundred miles from 
Easter Island in the eastern Pacific Ocean have 
reJX!rted finding large marine life communities 
With "unidentified fascinating objects" near hot-
water vents in the sea floor. 

The scientists are working aboard the Scripps 
Institution research vessel Melville in an area 20 
degrees south of the equator on the East Pacific Rise 
spreading center off the west coast of South 
America. 

The region is geologically active and much like a 
long string of undersea volcanoes. The cooled lava 
cracks and provides avenues for the near-freezing 
seawater to circulate deep in the earth's crust, 
where it is heated and then percolates up through 
the crust, leaching minerals and gases as it 
circulates back to the ocean. 

In an interview with the scientists by satellite 
eommunication with the ship, they reported that 
these gases are probably not of biological origin but 
generated by some other proce ,which is of great 
scientific interest. 

The chemical in the hot water vents support 
unusual marine life that was first found on another 
area of volcanic activity off the Galapagos Island in 

1977 and later in two areas off Mexico. 
In an initial radio message to report the "find" to 

the National Science Foundation, sponsors of the 
research program, the scientists told of colorful 
pictures of the vent communities, recorded by 
cameras towed behind the ship. The photographs 
depict giant clams, crabs, and limpet and some 
"unidentified fascinating objects." Among these 
are two-to-three-foot-Iong tube worms that are 
similar to those found at previous sites, but gray, 
rather than red, in color and lying down instead of 
standing. They also found starfish and a curious 
looking growth on lava floes, for the first time at a 
hydrothermal site. These communities were at a 

. depth of about 9,350 feet (nearly two miles; 2,850 
meters). Based on past experience the temperatures 
are expected to range from 72-140 degrees 
Fahrenheit (22-60 degrees Celsius), with a 
possibility of some as great as 660 degrees 
Fahrenheit (350 degrees Celsius), according to the 
scientists. 

Some of the hydrothermal vent form large, 30-
foot-high (nine-meter) chimneys that spew great 
plume of hot water charged with methane, 
hydrogen, and other gases and particulate . A 
major thru t of the expedition is a comprehensive 
geochemistry program to trace thi hydroth«(rmal 

circulation and analyze the chemistry of the 
seawater and earth's crust. 

Results of this study and the deep-sea camera and 
geological/geophysical operations will serve as a 
survey for future expeditions planned for 1982 and 
1983, which will involve scientists of several 
disciplines from the U.S. and foreign countries. 

The cruise began in early April and will continue 
through mid-May,

Coverage of elections was biased, unfair 

Editor: 
Ordinarily, we would allow 

the GU(lt'dian to report t he AS 
elections turmoil in peace. 
You have, however, raised 
serious and unsubtle 
innuendos bylour 'unbiased' 
reportinJ 0 the events 
surrounding the removal of 
Joshua Harris and Erik 
Singer from the run·off 
election. In your editorial 
(ominously unsigned) titled 
"No Respect" (Guardian , 
May 1) you imply that the 
will of the students has been 
thwarted and the AS 's 
"integrity" has been "further 
destroyed." This can be 
refuted by raising several 
points that you iffnored: 

1) Is the integrity of the AS 
damaaed when rules it 
considered important enough 
to include in the election 
codes, and which all the 
candidates agreed to follow , 
are enfora!d (as is now the 
case) or when they are 
flaunted (as would be the case 
were Harris and Singer's 
flagrant violations of two 
separate sections of the codes 
to go un· punished)? 
2) At the time of the Judicial 
Board's hearing, the sum of 
93 cents was ~ to by all 
parties (including Singer and 
Harris) as the minimum 
amount over budget, with the 
understanding that there 
was some unspecified 
amount still to be revealed. 
Indeed, in Paul Farwell's 
article, the sum has grown by 
$17. 
3) The main issue in the 
Judicial Board's considera-
tion was not the 93 cents, but 
the receipts and sample 
fliers, which according to the 
codes must be turned in 
before posting. They had 
been in the slate's possession 
for almost a week and were 
not turned in until the 
Election comission's hearing, 
after the polls had closed. 
4) The question of what else 
could have been done was 
ignored in your editorial. 
Consider the options: if the 
results were allowed to 
stand, significant violations 
would go ignored, and 
precedent would have been 
set to allow any future 
violation if it were not cau~t 
early enough. The electIOn 

codes specify a period of 48 
hours for filing violations 
after the polls have closed. At 
that time the only meaning-
ful sanction is disqualifica· 
tion: not being allowed to 
campaign or a reduction of 
spending limit (not to 
mention a warning) are only 
effective before voters have 
made up their minds. Such 
traditional punishments as 
incarceration or the 
confiscation of the first born 
male child are ~ond the 
power of the Elections 
Commiss ion , and would 
seem harsh (even for a $17 
overexpenditure). 

Finally , the adjectives 
"insensitive, ill -considered 
and just plain stupid" might 
better be applied to the 
Guardian itself than to the 
Elections Commission aT\d 
Judicial Board. Your articles, 
stressing one biased point of 
view, have merely exacerbat-
ed the situation . The 
students do have the right to 
their "duly elected presi-
dent ," but there is an 
assumption implicit in that 
phrase that the students 
knew whom they were voting 
for. Because Harris and 
Singer were not caugh t 
before the elec tion, the 
students assumed that the 
two candidates were honest 
and intelligent enough to 
obeY the rules. Perhaps if the 
facts had been known 
before the polls closed (as 
they should have been) there 
would be another "duly 
elected president." 

Knowi~ the pressures the 
Guordian IS under, trying to 
sell all those newspapers and 
come out a whole twice a 
week, we can understand the 
preference for spectacular 
rather than honest headlines 
and Paul Farwell's some-
what confused article. Your 
editorial, however, is an 
inexcusable example of 
yellow journalism, worthy of 
gracing the esteemed 
columns of that pinnacle of 
pontificating pomposity, that 
raucous respite ' for self-
righteous redundancies, that 
graceful ghastly gap-in-the-
head goon squad sheet, the 
new indicator. 

We also think the 
GU(lt'dian should stop ~hese

coverage_ 

Disgruntled student leaves 
Editor: 

After more than fwo fun 
quarters of study at UCSD as 
a re-entry student, I have 
decided to pursue my 
educational career else-
where. With the hope that my 
experiences may be of some 
help to other students and 
faculty , and with the 
knowledge that my situation 
is not unique, I have decided 
to write this letter. 

UCSD is a difficult school 
to transfer into. Because of 
the high academic standards 
which the school maintains, 
it is imperative that sound 
academiC counseling for 
proper course selection be 
available. As an older student 
I recognized this and met 
with several faculty and staff 
m'embers to chart my 
academic program. Despite 
these discussions, I was 
misinformed and i11-advised, 
and as a result I spent much 
of my time the first quarter 
struggling through a course 
that properly should have 
been taken at a later date. 

Two of my math classes, 
Math 2DA and 2EA , 
specifically l isted as 
application courses in the 
catalog, were both highly 
theoretical - the application 
dismissed as something to be 
learned on one's own time. In 
addition , Physics Lab 2BL 
failed to prOVide the slightest 
instruction as to the function 
and o peration of lab 
equipment. Run almost 
entirely by T A's, this course 
could have saved many 
students, including myself, 
hour s of fru stration by 
providing simple 10-minute 
de mon tra t ion s a t t h e 
beginning of class_ (Note: 
After much badgering, t his 
was done for the last two 
classe and wa tremendou -

ly helpful.) -
In attempting to work 

through these courses and 
difficulties I found many of 
my instructors inaccessible. 
When I was able to contact 
them, they often showed 
little interest in my questions 
or concern for my welfare. 

In short, my experiences at 
UCSD have revealed a 
system that places a 
premium on both research 
and graduate studies - a 
system that has little interest 
in its underfraduate 
students. While l'eCOfPlize 
the need for an educational 
facility that supports faculty 
research, this pursuit should 
not interfere with a public 
learning institutIOn's 
primary purpose of adequate 

and meaningful undergrad-
uate education. 

UCSD is a public-funded 
institution _ I think it 
essential that it start 
fu\fi11ing the needs of the 
public that supports it.

Judicial board ruling 
was unfair to Harris 
Editor: 

We are writing because we 
feel there has been a grievous 
misrepresentation of the 
students on the part of t he AS 
Elections Commission and 
Judicial Board. Are we to 
understand that the person 
we, the students , elected to 
the office of AS president will 
be denied the opportunity to 
serve u s becau s e of 
temporarily losing track of a 
few measly bucks?! 

The honesty shown by 
Joshua Harris 10 bringing up 
the additional $17 overex-
penditure has only reinforced 
our opinions that Harris is 
the man we wan t for 
president. Not only was the 
Jud icial Board 's decis ion 
unfair to the students, but it 
putsJules Ba~eris in t he bad 
position of bemg as igned t he 

office by default . 
How-can the Board caB this 

justice, when other admitted 
violators of the elections code 
were not su bjected to the 
same punisnment? We are · 
angry because due to the 
warped judgment of the 
Judicial Board, several 
hundred pennies have 
rendered insignificant the 
votes of the majority of the 
s tudents of UCSD. Why not 
ask the students whether we 
think this t riviality w as 
suffi c ient gr ound s fo r 
disqualification of the man 
we elected? We fou r voters 
say no! Slap Harris' hand if 
you must, but don ' t punish 
us_ -

Pentagon interferes with university research 
BY JOHN MARKOFF 

Pacific News Service 
PALO ALTO. CALIF. -

Renewed high levels of 
Pentagon fun ding for secret 
scie n ti f ic research on 
American university campu-

renewal of the o ld controver-

academicians are alarmed at 
the st r ings which are 
attached to the dollars, and 
are fearful that legitimate, 
non-military scientific 
research is bei ng sacrificed 
along with academic 

freedom. 
In a joint letter to the

released in early April, the 
presi d e n ts of five of 
America' major universitie 
expressed "grave concern" at

The letter asked t h e

the Depart ment of Defense, 
"are not intended to limit

expressed the fear that th

a "chilling" ef fect on

Withdrawal Method 
Is "withdrawal" an effective form of birth control? 
Wi thdrawal is one of the few birth control methods con troled 

by the male. It has been known since Biblical times, when it 
was politely referred to as "spilling seed." It sounds simple and 
effective, but really isn't. 

The first problem is that before ejaculation occurs, a pre· 
seminal fluid can be released from the male's penis containing 
enough sperm to cause pregnancy. It is not possible for the male 
to feel the release of this fluid. To theoretically work, the man 
must be very controled, very quick and have very good aim. He 
must have enough control not to ejaculate or leak while his 
penis is inside the woman. He must be quick enough to 
withdraw before he ejaculates. Hemust also aim away from the 
thighs, vagina or pubis of the woman, because sperm deposited 
there may still enter the vagina. 

Approximately 23 out of 100 women will become pregnant 
when us ing withdrawal as the only met hod of birth control. If 
you definitely don't want to become pregnant, other methods 
are available that have higher effectiveness rates. 

Toxic Shock Syndrome 
What are the symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome? 
Women who use tampons and experience the following flu-

like symptoms during their periods should remove the tampon 
at once and contact a Student Health Service physician. The 
symptoms include a high fever (usually 102 degrees or higher) 
th&t usu~ly comes on suddenly and is accompanied by a 
sunburn-lIke rash. There may also be vomiting, diarrhea, 
muscle aches and pains, sore throat, sore eyes or confusion.

revue!" Truly Loony! .

Women'-s waterpolo drowns Pomona 
BY JIM AGRONICK 

Staft W liter 
Heading into the final part 

of their season. the women's 
waterpolo team soundly' 
defeated both Pomona Pitzer 
and UC Riverside. 1~3 and 
12·2 last Wednesday. 

The Tritons got off to a 
slow start .inst Pomona. 
failing to capitalize on many 
fast· break situations and 
finished the first half with a 
small 2·1 lead. 

attack were Natalie Pierce, 
Diana Nelson. Patti Herr and 
Dede Steinhoff. 

Coach Dan Eby commen· 
ded goalie Nadine Thompson 
for her exreUent defensive 

However. moving into the -
second half. UCSD proceeded efforts. Thompson blocked 
to demolish the weaker Pitzer numerous shots and was also 
team. Leading the scoring good for six steals from the 

hole position-a feat that is 
rarely seen in waterpolo. 

The second game against 
UC Riverside proved even 
less eventful. "We did 
everything right against 
Riverside. and there were no 
mental lapses." said Eby. 

The faster UCSD team 
outswam Riverside and had . 
many extra·man goals. 
Scoring for the Tritons were 
lady McBrien. Ann Motekai· 
tas. and Nadine Thompson. 

Also. Eby praised Andrea 
Aronovitz. a Riverside native.

her hometown crowd.

Women netters tune 
up for regionals 

BY VALERI S. ANDERS 
It was only a "tuneup" for 

the regionals. but the 
women's tennis team put 
everyone on notice this 
weekend that they would be a 
contending force in that 
tournament by winning their 
conferenre championship. 

The top· ranked player 
from each school competed 
against the number one 
players from each other 
school. When it was over, 
UCSD's Cecilia Kavanagh 
was not only undefeated. but 
also named "All League 
Player of the Year" for 
number one seeded players. 

"Everyone played really 
well," said Liz Dudash, head 
coach for women's tennis. 
"They kept up their mental 
attitudes. " 

And with temperatures in 
the 90's and no breaks 
between matches, the 
Tritons had a difficult day 
physically as well. 

The end of the match saw 

UCSD in first, West Mount in 
second. Point Lorna in third. 
and Cal. Lutheran in fourth . 

Division titles went to each 
of the number one through 
five players, as well as the top 
two doubles teams. 

Coach Dudash was pleased 
with the effort her players 
showed, and expects it to 
carry over to the regional 
championships next week· 
end. "The top Division III 
schools will be there, so it 
won't be easy," said Dudash. 
Though Davis is favored to 
win, she hopes to finish in the 
top five. And if UCSD wins, 
they will head for nationals. 

Dudash was named "All 
League Coach of the Year" at 
the end of the conference 
tournament , and Laura 
Saavedra, Lisa Gilbert, 
Karen Barr and Elisabeth 
Sarr (seeded two through 
five, resP!7.tively) were each 
named ' All League'" players 
for their divisions.

12 The Guardian Monday, May 11, 1981 

Freshman leads UCSD golf team 
In his first year here, Nakamura is burning up the green 

BY NANCY LEE 
Staff Writer 

Sometimes it doesn't take 
very long to reach the top of 
the heap when you're jlOOd. 

A Warren freshman,lkuce 
Nakamura is one such 
individual, having played the 
number one position on the 
triton intercollegiate golf 
team for the entire 1981 
season. 

This is not surprising 
when one realizes that 
Nakamura has the qualities 
of a true athlete, and a strong 
potential to improve beyond 
what he thinks are his limits. 
He has that driving 
competitive force and a 
natllral ability for the game. 
Put this with his persistence 
and you will have the 
makings of someone who just 
won't quit. 

Nakamura is a graduate 
from Rolling Hills High 
School, where he played four 
years on the varsity golf 
team. Three out of these four 
years he made AlI·League in 

his conference, and was also 
individual league champion. 
He received awards from the 
school including "Athlete of 
the Year" and "Most 
Valuable Player." 

In his first year playing on 
a college team, Bruce finished 
the season at the District 
Championships third overall. 
He has, in addition to this, 

received an invitation to the 
NCAA Nationals in North 
Carolina. 

Nakamura set two goals at 
the start of the 1981 season. 
He wanted to be the top 
seeded player on the Triton 
team, and he wanted to win 
individually the District 
Championship Tournament. 

He finished third in the 
tournament. 

He com men ted that he was 
" a little disappointed in the 
second round. I wa tired and 
my concentration was 
slipping, so my playing got 
sloppy. I'm very competitive, 
and [ have the skill, but my 
ooncentration is weak." 

When asked about the 
team's goals, Nakmura 
thought the team could win 
the championship for the 
district. "There is a lot of 
talent on this team. I don 't 
think that any of us have 
reached our potential yet." 
He has high hopes for the 
talent to mesh with 
consistency in playing for the 
next year. . 

Although Bruce was not 
satisfied with his playing in 
the tournament, he is looking 
forward with anticipation to 
the Nationals. This is a 
chance for him to play the 
best he can against some of 
the toughe t players in the 
country. He said he wants to 
really enjoy the experience. 

Nakamura startd playing 
golf later than usual for such 
a skillful player. "My 
interest in golf started when I 
was 11 years old . My dad 
wanted to teach me a game 
that I could enjoy all of my 
life," he said. 

Nakamura continued

youth, taking lessons from 
golf pros. He first realized 
that he had potential to play 
well when in a lesson a golf 
p'ro told him that he had a 
'natural golf swing." 

Nakamura has played on 
many of the courses 
throughout California, and 
likes the variety. Since he 
has been at UCSD, his play 
has been limited to the 

His favorite courses are in 
northern California, namely 
the famous Pebble Beach and

Conc.ert offered songs and wry tails 
BY MARK WILSON 

Rosalie Sorrels, Terry Gathwaite 
an d Bobbie Louise Hawkins 
demonstrated Wednesday night that 
the American Oral Tradition is sti\1 
going strong. The robust quality of the 
performance stemmed from three 
fascinating personalities on stage 
relating their perspectives on women 
in American life. 

Rosalie Sorrels, playing an acoustic 
guitar, sang traditional folk songs, 
with a country flavoring, similar to 
Holly Near with her vocal range and 

th~mes. Several songs she sang as 

ballads, unaccompanied by herguitar, 
with a tolling vOice. 

Many of her so ngs were 
interspersed with stories of the 50's 
and 60's which related to the songs 
and often set the thematic rhythm for 
the trio. 

Terry Garthwaite presented a more 
jazz oriented performance often 
slipping into skat singing with a voice 
that was a cross between Janis Joplin 
and Bobbie Gentry. A number of times 
she attempted to mclude the audience 
into her choruses but was hampered 
by the sobering atmosphere ' of the 

Revelle cafeteria. Regardless, her 
music provided a regular shot of pep 
into the show. 

Bobbie Louise Hawkins read from 
her storie with a perfected voice of 
Texas drawl. Her unhurried dialogue

Mamet's 'American Buffalo': 
"There's no 'there' there" 
BY MIKE THOMAS 
According to the press 

release I have here in my 
grubby little paws, the play 
A merican Buffalo deals 
with the frustrations of 
three small·time characters 
in a Chicago junk shop as 
they "pummel each other 
with words that are like 
punches." 

Actually, the production 
of David Mamet's prize' 
winning play that opened 
last Thursday at the 
Mandeville Recital Hall 
pummels the audience with 
boredom more than 
anything. Which is not to 
say that anyone connected 
with the UCSD Drama 
Dept. is to be faulted (except 
the clown who chose the 
play) as the entire 
production is first-rate, 
from the sets, props, etc. to 
the magnificent portrayals 
by a trio of gifted actors. 

shit heads in the wilder-
ness," has virtually no idea 
about what it wants to do 
with itself. Is it an 
indictment of capitalism? Is 
it a character study of three 
losers who need each other 
despite their on~oing 
loathing of each other~Is it a 
depiction of dreams and 
frustrated aspirations? If i 
is ostensibly about any of 
these things, it fails 
miserably. for none of the 
themes is developed beyond 
a one-line indication that 
maybe there's more to this 
play than the surfaceennui . 
But it is. as Leonard Pvnth' 
Garnell (played by · Dan 
Akroyd on Saturday Night 
Live) would have said, bad 
theatre. Sort of Wailing for 
Codal set in Sanford & Son 
land as played by the Dead 
End Kids. And the audience 
is left continually waiting 
and waiting ... 

from this production. Dan 
Rosenberg is magnificent in 
his delineation of the junk 
dealer , everything about his 
performance rings true 
from his sniveling accent to 
the duck waddle of his walk. 
Peter G. Mor e is properly 
obnoxius as Teach, all 
swagger and bluster, while 
Richard Hahlo is effective 
as the whining Bobby. And 
Shannon Murphy's set 
deserve praise for their 
unique blend of seedy 
realism with a Pop Art 
sensibility (the rows of coke 
bottles are unabashedly 
Warholian). 

David Mamet's 'American Buffalo' The problem is that the 
play, about t hree "savage 

There are, to be sure, 
some pleasures to be derived 

A somebody once said of 
Oakland, "there's no there 
there." And there's no point 
to this play except as a 
substitute for valium. 
Hopefully, the drama 
department will next time 
choose a play that will do 
justice to its talented 
personnel. American 
Buffalo is not that play.

A "'1MWSaDd 

I find Manfred Wolf anicle, "Costa Rlca is not Nicaragua" upsetting for two rea-son : one, his irrelevant and unin-
formed remarks about Nicaragua, EI ai-
vador, Guatemala, and Mexicoj and [WO, his 
chauvinist American attitudes tOWArds "vaca-
tion" countries. 

First, Costa Rica is affected by the prob-
lems in EI Salvador: its military forces are a 
possible intervention force should 
Washington decide to invade EI al~dor. 
True, for the swinging American tourist EI 

alvador and Nicaragua are hardly a 
paradise now, but lhey were never a 
paradise for their own people. At last the 

icaraguan and the alvadomns have the 
chance to make their ountries democratic, 
peaceful, and orderly, for they are ridding 
th mselves not of cullural diversity (Wolfs 
explanation for their problems) but of the 
American busine men and plantation 
owners who have crushed them for tOO 
years. 

I had hoped that the ugly American tourist, 
expecting the rest of the world to kiss his 
feet, had dled out - but he has risen again in 
the form of Mr. Wolf. Countries hould be 
praised for their cultural treasures, not for 
ubservience to Americans. 

Costa Rica may well be a paradise for 
those looking for single's dubs. If it is a 
paradise, let it stand on its own merits, not 
on fuulty comparison. Ampersand is a good 
music paper - leave the tr'dvel guides to 
those who have mething intelligent to say.

I n reference to your Readers P II, you may have been disappointed in the re-sponses y u received, but I am more 
than di appointed at your analysis of those 
responses. How dare you ask, "Who is Leo 
Buscaglia?" especially when your offices are 
located in California. 

Leo Bu caglia is a professor at the Uni-
verSity of Southern California who teaches 
courses in, and tours nationwide conduct-
ing lectures on, the ubject of love . He has 
written two books with which I am familiar. 
One of th is a marvelous volume, now 
availahle in paperback, entitled simply 
LOVE. Not only are Professor Buscaglia' 
lectures well attended, but many times they 

aotJD 

are videotaped by school and television 
stations to be hown at OIher times. 

Leo has an excellent rapport with his au-
diences, especially wtten he speaks at col-
leges and universities. It is not unu uaJ for 
him to spend an hour after a lecture talking 
with, Ii tening to and HUGGING people 
who come up to the stage to see him.

t.ak a long time, but we're told (nay, prom-
I ed) that the Rolling Stone will indeed 
tour the .5. this June. This could also make 
life complicated for Stones drummer Char·

Farago, about the last nine months of Pat-

Bad Taste Is Timeless

K nnedy independent label, IRS (their 
records are usually di tributed by A&M), 
tOld Billboard recently, "but we think of 
them as the American Sex Pistols." 

A&M's reluctance is e pecially whimsical 
in light of an album cover and promo shot 
they put ou t about a month earlier. It 
depicts the "artist," Patrick D. Martin, grin-
ning wickedly and holding pistol-grip de-
vices, apparently detonator . A thick wire 
I ads from each device to the miniskirted 
crotch of a female mode l, seen on ly from

tionale, it must be that sexual· mutilation is 
terrific but political ati re is· repulsive.

George Thorogood & The Destroyers: 
"Wherever we play. we turn it into a dumpl" 

BY CHRIS MORRl 

"You've seen the how, right? Then what' the need of 
an interview?" Georg Thorogood curl s his lip as he 
says thi , revealing a set or large, dangerous-lOOking 
teeth "Fangs" may be the better term, considering 
Thorogood's apparel. Clad In a scintillating snakeskin 
jacket (idenlieal to the one worn by Marlon Brando 
In Tbe Fugilit'e Kind) and matching boots, he looks 
like a rattler coiling up ~ r the slrike, As Thorogood 
half-scowls and pus hes another cracker into his maw, 
he eyes my tape machine, I begin to wonder if it' 
next on the menu, 

" If I have to explain it to ya , . . " Thorogood 
lumps wearily against the wall of his subterranean 

dressing room in Pasadena' Perkins' Palace, where 
he is preparing for (wo sold-out evening shows. He 
continues, ") mean , you mUSt have a general idea of 
what it 's all about from seeing the hows!" 

Responses like these have years ofT an inter-
viewer's life span, but Thorogood may have a point 
The Wilmington, Delaware singer-guitarist's mu ic-
drawn from such diverse sources as the blues of EL-
more james, Jo hn Lee Hooker, and Hound Dog 
Taylor, the rock ' n' roll of Chuck Berry and Bo 
Diddley, and the country and western of Hank Wil-
liams and Johnny cash - is loud, r wdy and direa, 
and bener felt than explained. Thorogood's live eon-
cens are mlnl- prlngsteenian frenzies, with "lone-
some George" himself orchestrating the riot. As the 
Destroyers - drummer jdf imun, bassist Billy 
Blough, and saxophonist Hank Carter - lay down a 
barrelhoU5C roar behind him, the gUitarist does a 
Berry-style boogie duck walk across the tage, paus-
ing to dip the neck of his guitar over the heads of the 
crowd like a roadhouse Pope ble ing the masses. If 
it's a club show, Thorogood will dance across the 
ringside table tops, all the while wringing amped-up 
shrieks and sawmill bottleneck no ise rrom his Gib-
son 125. He's right: at moments like these, the brain 
shuts down and the feet start moving. 

Thorogood bristles like a porcupine if you request 
any deep thOUghts about hls mu Ic. "It's dirty, man, 
it's dirty," he replies. "We JUSt play it, man. We dig it. 
If it 's too ' ioud, we turn It down. If iI's not loud 
enough, we turn it up. What we do, I don't define it 
anyway. It's emertalnment, period. orne of iI's 
funny, some of it's ... out of tune. ThaI's very funny." 

Although Thorogood greets most que lions about 
his career as churlishly as master journalist blaster 
Frank Sinatra, a rough outline emerges, He first 
caught the bug for blues and good-lime rock 'n' roll 
about 10 years ago listening to a band whose reper-
toi re bears a marked similarity to the Destroyers'-
the Rolling Stones. At. the same time, he got a chance 
to hear the black greats of the style in person, in 
club and at concert in New England and the 
Northwest. 

" I saw 'em play, not a lot, but anytime I heard they 
were playing anywhere within 3000 miles, I went to 
see 'em play," Thorogood says. I ask him if he ever

Two OIher recurtls - 19 8's JllOI'e II Ull Ol'ff and

fers to the vinyl trilogy as "A FLu/Lil a/ l)ollars, For a

Ugly ." A good me,L,ure 01 the Destrorers' growing

band 's success with the 1979 release of some 1974 
demos cut by lhe band for th label. Thorogood, In-

the road for seven months to avoid inadvenent pub-
licit)' for the record. 01 that he minded that mu h: 
the layoff coin idetl with the baseball season. 

" I embarrass myself in the infield ," Thorogood 
says of his playing as second ba~eman with the 
semi-pro Delaware Destroyers. The band doesn 't 
LOur during the ba~ehall season (drummer imon is 
a teammate), but Thoroguod makes light of the 

mtJ.~ic press coverage accorded his baseball mania. 
"They've gOt th is thing hlown :111 out of pr ponion," 
he snarls. " It 's JUM :m aCtivity I have." Asked about 
reports that he is "giving up baseball for mu,ic," he 
replies, " If I'm gunna give it up for sumethin: she's 
gotta be good-looJdll,' at least." 

The spons-oriented conversation turn~ tu profes-
sional wreMling, and Thorogood's mood momentar-

"That dick," Thoroguod mutters. "You ever seen that 
li ttle pendant that Elvis Pre ' Iey gave him?" I am 
about to say that George himself, with his hulky 
frame and disquieting dlspo!>ltion, would make a 
good mat bad guy, hut t think better of It . 

The talk returns to musl , and the relative sClrcity 
of original material in Thorogood'~ repenoire (one 
inslrument:t1, "Kids from Phill y," Is credited 10 ':Jorge 
Th roscum "). Thorogood replies ellrne~t l y , ''I've 
been doing original m:nerlal off the ,Iage, but the 

ngs aren't any good.' If they were 35 good as the 
ones we play, we'd be usln' 'em, ),ou dig? I don't even 
let these guys (indic-.uing the band members) hear 
some of the Muff, it's too em 1Y.l mtss I ng. " 

So the Destroyers will continue to recorU and play 
bar-band-tough covers of roadhouse rock 'n ' roll and 
blues? At the woru "roadhouse," Thorogood gives 
me one of his "Wh:u-do-rou-mean,qr" look.~. "When 
I heard all that mU'IC, I didn't really think it he-
lunged anywloere. I didn 't think it helonged in a

With pride, he continues, "Besides, wherever we

or not, it becomes devastated It' the five-man trio,

Modern Romance 
starring AJbert BrooIrs and Kathryn 
Harrold; written by Broolrs and 
Monica JoImson; directed by BrooIes. 

M <XIem Romance has been called Alben Brooks' Annie Hall, and In 
a few ways that's accu1':lle: It depicts an 
obsesSive, possesSive neurotic man 's 
hot and cold romance. reportedly 
based on one of Brooks' own, but here 
he gives himself the role of a film 
editor. Brooks, unlike Allen, is entirely 
unsentimental; he never begs us to 
love him, as Allen often does. Brooks 
refuses to pander, refuses to be adora· 
ble - and therein lies his strength and 
weakness. 

While Brooks' satire (when the film 
direaor Interferes with the editing, or 
when Brooks and his assistant must 
add sound effects to a silly space flick) 
is aimed at the film Industry and It's 
deadly acctJI'1IIe, much more uncom· 
fortable In il5 hilariry than Allen's HoI· 
Iywood pany In Annie Hall. Allen 
makes fun of· HoUywood as an out· 
Sider; Brooks is very much an insider, 
at times devastating, other times (al. 
lII08I) compasslonatlt. 

Brooks' 5CI"eelpbly is uncompromis-
Ing In iD dcpktion of a jerk, a man 
who can't or woo't IVO'" up, make up 
his mind or stick with a decJsion . 
There arc really only two problems 
with Modem 1lotrttIna: Harrold's role 
is underwrtuen; she seems far too 
normal to put up with Brooks. She 
must have had some obsessive quirks 
of her own, b.ut these are never reo 
veaIcd. And second, Brooks never leis 
the :rudIencc side with him. I wanted 
to Hire his charaaer, wanted him to 
tlckIe the old empedly gland, but most 
of the time I JUSI wanted to rattle his 
IeClh.

A DAM & THE ANTS Kings of tbe Wild Frontier 
(EpiC) SUitable gimmicks aren't easy 
to com by these days, especially now 
that Adam and the Ants have laid claim 
to a whole handful. Get this: a (for-
merl y) mohawked gay guy called 
Adam Ant who dons feathers, warpaint 
and a pirate suil, promotes "Ant music 
for expeople" and si ng stuff like 

"brush me daddy-o." The weirdest part 
Is that this odd concoction actually 
works. 

First of all, the music is dominated 
by the Indian motif. The foundation of 
Kings of tbe Wild Frontier is formed by 
two drummers beating o ut tribal 
rhythms - bOlh Indian and Afrle-dn. 
This constitutes the Antsound, as rec-
ognIzable a musical lrademark a~ has 
been created In rock music. The Ants 
feel no 'remorse namedropplng 
Geronimo, making reference to the 
Klowa, Pawnee and Apaches and utiliz-
Ing chanting vocals and choruses 
throughout. 

The package is calculated and pre-
tentious, but Adam Ant's vocals are 
confident, Inventive and versatile. 
When upponed by strong melodies 
and neat-o Marlboro adverti ement-
style guitar lines, Mr. Ant makes a con-
vincing ease for his Antmusic. 

But AnLSound, being relentless and 
self-obsessed, grows wearisome. This 
band isn't coment with one theme 
song, il has five. Which means they 
spend more time Inging about them-
selves than anythlng else, as In "The 
Magnificent Five." Of course, urban 
cowboys and outlaws pend 24 hours a 
day In self·absorption too. Maybe, for 
some, Antmusic Is the Ant-ldote.

JOE EL Y M usta Notta Gotta Lotta 
(Soutbcoast ! MCA Ileconls) Joe Ely's 
problem with vinyl may not be evident 
to those who've never witnessed his 
Incendiary live show, but for the for-
tunate who have, nothing he's commit-
ted to grooves cO!lles clO5e with the 
possible exception of live Shots. an 
English Import featuring some London 
dub dates with members of the Clash 
sitting in. Musta Nona Gotta l.otIa -
certainly a prophetic title - is no ex-
ception. It's another in a disappointing 
run, casting Ely - surely one of the 
most exciting and astute songwriters 
and song Interpreters In the hard 
country vein - as a pallid and Stand-
offish Jerry Lee lewis clone. 

To be fair, not everything that's 
wrong with this album Is Ely's f:1U1t. 
Musta NOfta Is not the strongest collec-
tion of tunes he's ever attaCked; partlc. 
u1arly weak are the contributions from 
long time collaborator, Butch Han· 
cock, who More the magnificent "West 
Telt:lS Waltz," "Fools Fal l In Love" and 

"Boxcars" on earlier Ely LP·s. "Wishin' 
for You," one of two Hancock titles 
here, sounds like a Jimmy Buffett out· 
take. 

Also iII·advIsed are half·heaned reno 
deri~ of Roy Brown's classic "Good 
Rockin' Tonl8ht" and Shorty Long's 

"1Iock Me My Baby." Herein lies the 
central, and mtal, conceit of MUSIQ 
NoIta GoIM J.oIIQ-)oe Ely the rocker. 
Despite t he turned·up collar and 
peaed beck hair he sparta 01\ the 
OCHer, Joe Ely Is IOOIl deddedIy not a 

MIIIY, 1981 

rock and roll singer. His formidable 
lyric went and undeniable sensitivity 
to nuance place him firmly in a vener· 
able country tradition - he has more 
to say than a backbeat could ever tell 

Sadly, he has almost no opportunity 
to say it here. Even with some respea· 
able wordplay In hand - Jimmy Gil· 
m re' "Dallas" or his own "I Keep 
Gettin' Paid the Same" - Ely is rushed 
through like a wino given the bum'~ 
rush. His phrasing Is shot to hell and 
the search for frenzy relegates his con 
summate backing band to boogie 
wonderland. 

Joe Ely's sojum with the English 
new wave has done the lad no good 
the distance he feels from this material 
I all too evident. Look homeward, Joe.

M cCOY TYNER QUARTETS 4X4 
(Mllestone)4X4 is the latest, and 
probably final, collaboration for Mile· 
stone Reco rds between pianl st/ 
composer McCoy Tyner and producer 
Orrin Keepnews (Keepnews has rIO' 
igned as head of A&R, McCoy recentl) 
igned with Columbia), an association 

that has found Tyner in many exotic 
recording contextS. 

On this date, McCoy uses bassi t 
Cedi McBee and drummer AI F05ter a.!> 
a house rhythm section: both men gh" 
Ing the leader exactly the rugged, in· 
tense supports he thrives on, and he 
invites old friends Bobby Hutcherson 
and Freddie Hubbard and new con 
freres Arthur B lythe and John Aber· 
crombie to each play a side. The pr 
gram, consisting mostly of Tyner' pul· 
sating originals and selected standard" 
Is a satisfying offering. 

Vibraharpist Hutcherson is one with 
Tyner: the twO think and play a, 
brothers, so it's natural that their three 
tunes are the album's zenith, wit h 
Thelonlous Monk's "POannonica" a tour 
de force for the leader. Tatc:en at a gen· 
de gait, this enchanting piece shows 
how much. McCoy has grown as a 
p ianist. Perhaps inspired by Monk's 
handsome composition, he plays with 
a tuneful restraint and lightness often 
missing In his work, bringing out ele· 
gant, tinkling curved lines of immacu· 
late clarity and beauty. Hutcherson's 
moments come on " I Wanna Stand 
Over Th.ere," where, not needing to 
pause for breath, he gallops ecstatically 
over quiet yet probing compings. "The 
Seeker" Is a we ll·swu ng medium 
walker that both men groove on. 

Hubbard is without his customary 
verve and park though the trumpeter 
manages to make the most of McBee's 

"Paradox," riding to a bubbling climax 
following a roll icking trio outing, 
where Foster 's back beats lay th e 
groundwork for a locked-hands cres· 
cendo from Tyner. Bonf:l's "Manha De 
Carnival" Is uneventful but pleasant 
and the trio Is dashing on " Inner 
Glimpse." 

Hardly the radical many critics deem 
him, a1toist Blythe scores well here, 
sporting a bright, singing tone on 

" Slues In the Minor," buildlng his solo 
by pushing the volume then hilling 
1008, high, wallill8 notes. Though his 
vibrato Is too wide 01\ the ballad, " scay 
M Sweet As You Are," he acqulu him-
self handily on the uptempo cooker, 
' It's You or No One," demomtrating a 
sol id IeChnlque. Tyner kicks back the 
suueture on " Blues" and heads for

Mel Brooks Rewrites the History of the \\Odd: 
LIONS 10, 
SHORT JEWISH 
COMICI0~ 

E
ven on the Twentieth Century Fox lot, surrounded by sets of Wild 
West aloon and /lello Dolly's elevated train station , Mel Brooks 
manages to attract attention. Running around in a Roman gladiaLOr's 
helmet, he could be a crazed refugee from a arurday m rning car-
toon how, a cross between, say, the It ad Runner and Daffy Duck. A 
young courier cruising by in a golfe-drt -docs a doublctakc when 
Brooks Jumps suddenly from his position face down on the cement 

LO the LOp of h~ car, tilts back the hat, gestures wildly and begins shollting 
suggestions a-mile-a-mlnute LO a visiting phO(ographer. 

Even when he's settled down upstairs in his pacious corner suite, Brooks 
seems to take as much pleasure telling guesLS about his new film, His/ory of 
the World, Part I, as they do from viewing his frenetic performance. 

" I read a 10( of history books," he begins. ''I've gO( a book over there, The 
First Two Million Yeon-. 1be first two miUion years were a gas, and then when 
the vapors coalesced, you had the earth. -

"Gas is good," he continues, nO( waiting to figure out if anytxx:ty got the 
last one. " I used it in B/az;ng Saddles and It made me a fortune. But seri-
ously, ladies and germ" history is fascinating .... " 

You can take a comic out of the Borscht Belt, but thjs babbling Brooks will 
always be the same Melvin Kaminsky from Brooklyn, telling "jew jokes" and 
maklng up In energy, determination and chutzpah what he might lack In fin· 
esse. In fact , sitting comfortably upstairs in knit shirt, blue jeans and tennis 
shoes, he seems like nothing so much as your sweet Uncle Mel - the one 
who thrills the kiddies by pull ing quaners magically from their ears. 

Friends and co-workers praise Brooks for hls warmth and professionalism 
as much as for his manic wit. ay Gregory Hines, a successful Broadway 
singer/dancer/aaor making only his second film appearance In Hfstcry of the 
World: "He's a wonderful guy. He can talk camera talk with the camera man, 
lighting talk with the Iighting-man-whatever needs to be done. } just got. the 
feeling that when he says to do something a certain way, it 's gonna go down 
right." 

0( that Brooks doesn 't appreciate good advice. On the contrary, c~wrIters 
and performers all praise him for his openness to their uggestions during the 
filmmaking process. As Hines pULS it, "He gives you the creative freedom to 
let you make an ass of yourself." 

Thinner, grayer and a little balder than he WdS three-and-a·half years ago 
when he played Dr. Richard Thorndyke, head of the Psychoneurotic Institute 
for the Very, Very Nervou in his last film, High Anxiery, Brooks i almost 55 
now and stili eager to play the creative ass, so long as It works on film. In 
addition, while writing, producing, directing, helping score and performing 
several major roles in the new movie, Brooks also found time to establish h ' 
own producti n com pan whose first project, Elephant Man, co-starring h~ 
wife, Anne Bancr ft, captured eight Academy Award nomln:u.ions. 

"} t k ElcphaT/l Man t everybody, and I c uld n sell II to anyhody, to 
anybody," he says. " I took It to every studio In town, and they id, 'A dis· 
toned human being hot in black &: white? Oh, it sounds like a Little downer. 
A mall downer.' I said, 'You're confusing Elepbmll Man with wlium."· 

May.1!Jtll 

With comedy enjoying a Hoi· Iywood renaissance, Brooks had no such troubles get· ting History off the ground. He's earned clout nO( only 
because he turns out hits , but be· 
cause he turns them out on time and 
inexpensively. The new one, for in· 
s tance, cost about $12 million to 
make - not much by Hollywood 
standards, especially since it's so rich 
in atmosphere from different histori· 
cal periods. 

Where other filmmakers pad 
budgets with cocaine expenses and 
travel allowances, Brooks works hard 
to eliminate waste - a standard he 
applies to his own life as well . " I 
don't feel I'm a Rolls Royce ," he says, 
by way of explaining why, with his 
conSiderable wealth, he still drives an 
old Honda Accord. "I'm a little per-
son, you know . .. I lI',>ould look Silly 
in a Rolls Royce." 

till , the new film L~ his m t ex· 
pensive, ambitiou project to date. 
The idea for it hit him as he was 
wrapping up Higb Anxiery, a sa lute to 
Hitchcock-s tyle suspense hlms. 
Brooks had already done sendups of 
~everal film genres - the Western in 
Blazing addles, the horror film in 
l'oung Frankenstein; the oldies in SI· 
le1l/ MOIre - and he wanted to tackle 
something bigger. 

" I said, 'I'm gonna go pa t the 
genre state, right to where it hap. 
pened. I'm gonna go right to hiStory. 
History is so beautiful, so gmnd, so 
spectacular, that to play little human 
jokes again t it i perfect counter· 
point. 

" For instance, in the Roman Em· 
pire (that's where he got the helmet), 
Gregory Hines, a young, black actor, 
and } are running away logether, and 
the Roman army is after us becawe 
we've had a 101 of trouble with Nero. 
And we run Into Oedipus, and he 
has a big s180 that says, 'Give 10 
Oepldus, I'm blind: and he' tapplll8 
his way akq. 

"And Oedipus somehow recosnizes 

the black guy, josephus, and he says, 
'Hey, what do you say, jo ephus?' 
And Josephu says, 'Hey, motherf-r, 
how are you?' 

.. a lOt of people laugh because 
we just use the word 'motherf-.. er," 
but a lot of people real ize that 
Oedipu wa Indeed the only o ne 
you could use that appellati n for." 

o need to tell Brooks that some 
people might call that a crass way LO 
get a laugh; Br ks has made crass-
ness a personal cause. From all indio 
cations, History will outgross all his 
other films In more ways than one. 

" I think taste is one of the worst 
detriments to good comedy," he ex· 
plains with obvious commitment. 
"Taste i in the eye, ear, n se and 
thr at f Ihe beholder, right! Thank 
God, I am bereft of any smidgeon of 
it. '· 

ormally gentle and kind-hearted, 
Brooks gets worked up over critics 
who fail to appreciate his com ic sryle. 
When told that Moll)' Haskell once 
wrote that he championed the "bulg-
ing eyes and bosoms" school of hu· 
mo r, he snaps, "What Is a Mo lly Has-
kell , and what will he ever contrlb· 
ute to the education, 'cu lture or en· 
tertainment of her world? She's part 
of a small army of snipers that don't 
understand the process and have no 
talent for it - very much like a 
eunuch watching the sexual act per-
formed . He ca n watch it , but he 
doesn't understand it." 

Brooks gets his revenge in His· tory of the World, Part 1 (no Part II is planned). During the opening segment, which takes place during the lOne Age, 
his old pal id Caesar plays the 
world's first artist. "And then we have 
a critic, a caveman critiC," he says, 
delighted with the imagery. " Right 
away, as soon as the fir t artist ap' 
pears, there's the critic." 

.What the critic doe, In typical 
Brooksian fashion, is stand on a rock 
and urinate all over the cave wall, 
washing away the artist 's work and 
chasing admirers away by the foul -
ness of h Is act. 

If Brooks gets antsy over criticism 
of such scene , It 's because they 
touch close to the heart of h is view 
of film comedy. "COmedy I a very 
tricky and delicate proces , and the 
closer you are to the mark, the 
closer to the truth, the bigger the 
reaction is going to be," he says. 

"Blazing Saddles did n<Xhlng more 
than just tell the truth about some 
cowboy around a campfire; we 
dkIn't do anything but have them eat 
beans and drink coffee, and what foI, 
lowed was very natural." 

A "'I"rsand 

NOt urprisingly, Brooks began developing his ii{yle as a "tum meier" in t~e Catskills during the 19 Os. There , he wa charged with running 
around, keeping h tel guests happy 
and playing drums for the 
saxophonist-comi , id Caesar. When 
Caesar broke into the ncdgling tele-
vi ion industry in 19 9, he brought 
Brooks along to help write his mate-
rial for $50 a week. 

Your . boUi oj Shows beca me 
Brooks' vehi Ie for stardom. His sal-
ary. increased a hundred· fold during 
the next 10 years, and he devel ped 
his craft with s uch luminaries a 
Woody Allen, eil Simon, Lary Gel , 
bart and Carl Reiner. 

His association with Reiner soon 
made comedy history when in 1960 
Brook created a character dubbed 
the Two·Thousand-Year·Old Man. 
Capitalizing on his quick wit and 
Reiner's talents as straight man, the 
twO would go into the recording 
studio and ad lib for hour on end. 

"Carl would ask me about different 
characters,:' Brooks says. "He would 
say, 'Old you kn w Cleopatra?' And I 
would say, 'I knew her; she was the 
next pyramid over.' And he said, 'Did 
she really die that way?' I said, 'Nun-
sense. No asp, no biting, none of thai 
bull - t. The woman died at 83 from 
a stroke.''' 

!"rom there, Brooks jumped into 
films, and he hit the ground running. 
Hi first picture, Tbe Producers, In· 
c1uded the classic production se -
quence, " pringtime for Hitler ( in 
Germany):' with s ores of c ho rus 
girls formed Into swastikas, singing 
this absurd number that Brooks 
wrOte. Even today he Jdmits that , ar-
tistically, The Prodll ers is a LOugh act 
to top. And in the SixtIes, Brooks 
created the TV series Get Smart -
still playing n local channels acro. S 
the country. 

By now , Brooks says, he has devel peel an involved RCoceS.~ of filmmaking that prKtically guarantee - him public accep-tance with ea h work: " I have 
bribed 16 million Americans . I've 
given them $3 ap iece to laugh at my 
movie." 

0, no, that 's not it. He really does 
have a process; it Involves reening 
each film at different tage, rewrit-
ing, that sort of thing. And he' cer· 
tain that it works, so certain that the 
only time he'll allow himself a little 
self-doubt i when a movie opens. 
"On that night," he say , "I'm a little 
suicidal. I'm always on the ground 
Hoor because if I was In the balcony, 
I'd hurl myself to my death." 

The situation can indeed be a 
problem. One L.A. journalist tells a 
tory about the lime he was invited 

to view an early recning of Blazillg 
Saddles and had the misfortune to sit 
In front of some guy who, every time 
anything the least bit amusing oc-
curred on reen, would guffaw so 
loudly as to obscure the lines. 

She finally got up the nerve tQ ask 
him to quiet down, bUI thought bet-
ter of It when he turned ar undo 
The offending patron , he realized, 
was Brooks.

methlng fundamentally likeable 
about Jeffrey's brand of street·tough 
rock makes his shoncomings less grato

("Modern Lover ," " Christine"), urban 
allenati n (Mystery Kids" ) and youth· 
ful ambition (R.0.c.K. " ) with the be· 
Iievable passion of Bruce pringsteen 
at his best. But his flaws are hard to 
Ignore - he tends to be awkwardly 
pretenti us as a ngwriter, reaching 
for The Major tatemem but rarely say· 
Ing anything of substance. " Miami 
Beach" (Induded on the album 's 
bonus EP) is an Irritating example of 
this, Intended as a hard-hitting com-
