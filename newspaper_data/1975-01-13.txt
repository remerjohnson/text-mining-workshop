The University in Society 

Tay-Sachs 
Screenings 
Scheduled 

by John H. Taylor 

John Wayne Hill, a Scripp's 
Institution of Oceanography 
researcher. was still missing 
yesterday afternoon aboard the 
vessel Gulfstream off the coast 
of New England. 

One body and a life ring from 
the ship have been found by 
searchers. A spokesman for the 
Coast Guard search and rescue 
office in Boston told the Triton 
Times yesterday that nearly 40 
air and marine units are in-
volved in the search for the ship, 
which was . to return to port at 
Boothbay, Maine la~t Sunday 
after checking experimental 
data collection buoys for a 
weather research project. 

Hill, who lives with his wife 
Cindhi in Solana Beach, is 
attached to the expedition as a 
representative from the weather 
research project at Scripps. Born 
in Riverside, Hill obtained his 
BA from the University of 
California campus there in 1967, 
and his MA in oceanography 
from Scripp's in 1973. He began 
work at Scripp's in July of that 
year . 

The search for the Gulfstream 
began after Bigelow Laboratories 

at Boothbay, which participates in 
the weather project along with 
Nova University in Ft. Lauder-
dale, notified the Coast Guard 

I 

J ohn Wayne Hili 

Tuesday that the ship had not 
returned . 

The body of James D. Riddle, 
assistant to Dr . William 
RichardsolN)f Nova, who is also 
aboard the missing craft, was 
found late Thursday between 
Boothbay and Glouster, Maine. 
The life preserver was also found 
Thursday .

is "important for people who are 
trying to figure out what they can 
really do in the university," and 
are not just after a degree,ac-
cording to Lincoln Cushing, who 
helped design the new course . 

The class is billed as being " for 
those serious about gaining a 
better understaQding of the 
uni versity's function in society 
and the role that students may 
take in improving their 
educational experience." It is 
scheduled to meet Thursday 
evenings from 7 to 10 pm in Hss 
2321 . 

Two Quarters 
The class is the first of an in-

tended two-quarter sequence : the 
first quarter with emphasis on the 
history and social functions of 
high education, the second to 
cover strategies for change within 
the university . 

Class professor Robert Heifetz 
said the primary focus will be on 
the University of California . Areas 
of study include the university's 
role in the capitalist system, the 

history and current status of 
varied forms of instrututional 
reform within the university, and 
students' roles in that reform . 

The class structure will involve 
weekly symposiums, project 
groups and "process-{)riented rap-
groups." In addition, each 
st uden t will be required to 
participate in a team project. 
Cushing sa id · that some projects 
under cu rrent consideration 
include minorities and their 
rei ationsh i ps with higher 
education, a study of the student 
protest movements of the sixties 
and a study of student govern-
ments, especially UC San Diego's. 

Heifetz envisions a class of 
people who have been involved 
in school affairs and want to learn 
more fully how the school works. 
The class then will attempt to pull 
"theory and practice together" he 
said. 

People who have been active in 
the school will learn theories of 
change, and people who are 
better versed in theory will learn 
the practical side through 
required team projects . 

A countyw id£, series of 
screening clinics for Tay-Sachs 
disease will begin this month In 
the orth County, followed by 
similar programs during th 
spring in th£' East County and 
South Bay areas 

Also b ginning thiS month at 
UC San Di go 's University 
Hospital are Tay-Sachs scr£' nlng 
cI inics for pregnant mothers Th£' 
clinics, available by appointment 
on ly, are held each Tuesday 
morning. 

The orth County programs are 
scheduled from 5 30-8 ' 30 pm, 
January 22, at the North County 
Jewish Community Center, Vista, 
and 5:30-8 :30 pm, January 23, at 
Poway High School. 

Continuation 

triton times 

The two programs are a 
continuation of the Tay-Sachs 
prevention program initiated in 
San Diego in October and 
sponsored by the March of 
Dimes, University Hospital, the 
Department of Pediatrics at the 
School of Medicine, San Diego's 
Reg ional center for the 
Developmentally disabled, and 
the Presidents' Council of Jewish 
Women 's Organization . 

Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder 
that develops in intants before 
birth and primarily affects Jewish 
children of eastern European 
descent. There is no known cure 
and life expectancy is about three 
to five years Infants, normal at 
birth. develop symptom s by SIX to 
eight months of age. It IS 100 
times more common in Jewish 
children than in non-Jews, With 
one case occurring in about 3,000 
Jewish birth~

Coop Meets 
Tonight 

The Stud nt Cooperative will 
hold its first meeting of the 
quarter at 6 pm today in the first 
floor conference room of the 
Student Center. 

Discussion this evening will 
center on the election next week 
of the four at-large members of 
the Coop's Budget Resources 
Group (BRG), the organ that 
sparked most of last quarter's 
controversy. 

The four members are intended 
to insure racial, ethnic or sexual 
balance on the BRG, which 
recommends how Coop money 
should be spent. • 

an xhaustive two-year study, has 
e timated that , in 1972, 26 million 
Americans had tried mari juana, 
with 8 million of th se u ing it 
regularly . The Comm i sion 
recommended that posses ion of 
marijuana for personal use and 
casual distribution no longer be a 
criminal offen e. 

Oregon was the first and only 
stat to partially adopt this 
recommendation . California and 
many other states are consideri ng 
legislation which would be 
similar to the Oregon system . 

legal Dope 

Oregon abolished criminal 
penalties for possession of one 
ounce or less of marijuana in 
October of 1973 . Simple 

po~session of marijuana in 
Oregon is now a civil offense 
carrying a maximum fine of $100 
and no jail term or criminal 
record . Last October, the In-

dependent Drug Abuse Council 
commissioned a survey to 
determin(' what changes hav 
occurred in the past year in drug 
usage and in public opinion 
concerning the Oregon Law. 

Approval 

Of the 802 adults interviewed, 
three out of every ten signalled 
approval of the law while 26 
percent would favor an even 
more liberal statute which would 
make small sa le and possession of 
marijuana legal. 

More specifically, 32 percent of 
those questioned were content 
with the penalties as they now 
stand in Oregon . Fifteen percent 
favored making small amounts of 
marijuana compl~tely legal, 11 
percent would .like to see both 
sale and possession of small 
amounts made legal , and only 39 
percent would prefer stiffer 

penalties . Almost 50 percent of 
those over thirty wanted stiffer 
penalties

UCSD Picture Meal Cards Now Good at Coffee Hut and Snack Bars 
Barrett Sees No Flood of Diners 
From Cafeterias to Snack Bars 

BegilU'ling today, students holding UC San Diego food service picture meal cards will be able to use 
them toward the purchase of food at UCSD's snack bars and at the Coffee Hut . 

According to Housing and Food Sen' ices director larry Barrett, the system wa devised a an "ad-
ditional service" to students, some of whom may have classes or other appointments during the regular 
hours in the three cafeterias. 

No Migration 
Barre" say, he does not forsee a migration of regular cafeteria diners to the snack bars or to the Hut. 

"They won't have unlimited seconds there," he said. 
While the Revelle and Muir snack bars serve entrees that are often meals that were served the ame 

day in the respective cafeterias, the Coffee Hut and the Winzer Commons at the Medical School serve 
food "at is ordered and prepared separately from the cafeterias. 

Some students uy the food at the Hut is be"er than at the cafeterias. 
Picture meal urds will be acceptable at the snack bars .nd the Hut on we8days only at all times 

they are open except 10 to 11 am and 2:30 to 4:30 pm. Temporary cards will not be acceptable. 
Students may only use their meals urds for 5?O at breakfast, a dollar at lunch, and 51.30 at dinner 

time. Students must make up any differences in ulh. 
Barre" told the Triton Times that the system is now operatinR on" trial basis, but tNt he believes it 

wil be mntinued on a permanent basis.

Po,r 
Refrie etators 

It is very ran~ hat one gets a 
chance to tak~ social action, 
except in small ways. In con-
ducting one's life here, injustices 
that demand incividual action do 
not often present themselves, and 
if they do it is only with the 
greatest eHort, it seems, that the II, J""", H. r.,JOI" 
action comes. Conscience can get 
rusty when the larger parts of the mind are too busy. L-___________ ....J 

Now, I don't want to indict anyone, at least not too seriously. But I 
have not enjoyed much of what I have seen of the output of the Visual 
Arts department, though that is my own prejudice. I even managed to 
suspend judgement last year when Malcolm and I were called into 
photographic and reportoral action by a student In a sculpture class 
that had seen another student kill , cook and eat a rabbit during a class 
session . A few of the students had walked out in what can only be 
called !tter disgust, a few stayed and argued with the professor and the 
student who killed the rabbit, and a few watched, and accepted, the 
killing. 

The student had performed what he and his instructor called a ' life 
sculpture'; it was intended to confront the class with the reality of 
meat eating - that is, to remind us that the hamburger we eat in the 
cafeteria (or some undetermined fraction of it) was at one point part of 
a beast of the field . 

To me, the sculpture conveyed an insulting, quasi-intellectualism 
that I had little use for, but I chose not to make an issued of it in the 
paper at the time because it would not have be n fair to allow my 
prejudice to interfere in my perception of What is News. After a few 
months of thought , however, I have become convinced that the killing 
was dangerously immoral , and that we should have pre ented the 
story . 

Anyway, at the end of last quarter, I saw an exhibit of sculpture 
along the east side of the Humanities library, which I viewed With my 
usual skepticism several times. I was particularly offended (again 
prejudiciously, of course) by one work that consisted of concrete 
flowing fro,," an old refrigerator . I determined that it displayed, in an 
especially vivid fashion, the waste in our ocietie of refrigerators and 
concrete. These excesses, however, do not touch my existence directly, 
except when I walk over to Muir, so I forgot about the sculpture ap-
proximately six seconds after I walked away. 

That is, until the other day, when I walked by again with Soto. We 
were on the way to the Coffee Hut for a club sandwich and our daily 
discussion of religion in the metropolis . The refrigerator was sitting on 
the dock, sans concrete, as if it were waiting for someone to pick it up 
and take it home. It was not until we ahived at the Hut that I 
remembered seeing children playing in the fountain pvery Saturday 
morning last Quarter, when the water wasn' t running. I think I 
remembered them particularly because they dress d in brighter clothes 
than the people I normally see there, made much happi r noises, and 
managed to find use of the fountain while the rest of us wmplalned 
that the water wasn't running. It was a nice thing to rememb r, and was 
much more pleasant than religion in the metropolis . 

Then I remembered that children sometimes lock themselves in 
empty, abandoned refrigerators and die. And I remembered that the 
children play in the fountain on Saturday after attending a class in the 
basement of the Humanities library, and that they run by the loading 
dock. 

I spent a day deciding what to do. Rusty conscience and all . I was 
going to call the Visual Arts department, havi ng been previously 
enlightened as to their profound respect for the sanctity of cow life, 
and sure their concern would spread to children (whom you can' t put 
in hamburgers, of course. At least, not yet) . 

It occured to me that Visual Arts might be embarked on another life 
sculpture, perhaps having installed a sound-activated tape recorder in 
the refrigerator. Then they could have played the sounds of the first 
child they captured crying and gasping over the speakers in the 
cafeteria for people to hear while they eat their various hamburgers. 

Indeed, proving the evils of technology (in the form of old 
refrigerators) can only be considered a noble goal. Although such a 
project would probably be illegal, we have to remember that the law is. 
often slow in keeping up with man's creative and artistic advances . 

I decided, however, to allow prejudice (in favor of ch ildren) to Win 
this time When I went down again, I pushed th e refrigerator over on 
its fron t, so .no one could climb in . If the Visual Arts department does 
not have its errant sc ulptor take his refri gerator away by tomorrow, I 
will push It off the dock and pry th e door off wi th a st el pole or 
something (I think I have already broken the handl e) . 

After that, I wi II leave the poor thing alone.

V'ball ·Signups Today 

For all of you who were worried that you might not be able to play 
volleyball this quarter, fret not . It was just an oversight on the part of 
the 1M Dept. and this reporter to fail to announce that there will in-
deed be 1M Volleyball. 

Volleyball play will be on Monday and Thursday nights. This quarter 
the competition will be coed sixes, so get your six together and show 
up at the captain 's meeting, which by mere chance is TODAY. We are 
sorry to give you such a short notice, but we know that volleyball 
players can get a team together in a minute if they have to. You have 
too, if 't(>u want to play. The meeting time is 4 pm, the place is the Rec 
Gym Conference Room. 

lest we forget you soccer players, the captain'~ meeting will be on 
rridayat 3 or 4 pm , depending on whether you are playing in the men' s 
or coed leagues. The Johann Cruyff's of this school will not want to 
miss out. 

Now we come to men's floor hockey. This year the Question will be 
whether or not any tE'am will be able to upset preseason favorite EI 
Ch unko. EI Chunko has added all-league goalie Paul Wagner to its all -
star (Jeff Cannis) lineup and appears to be an exceedingly tough team 
to beat . Only problem is that this quarter it is men 's floor hockey, so 
the aggressive EI Chunko women probably won't be suited up. Too bad 
for EI Chunko. For those of you wishing to challenge the supremacy of 
EC the captain's me ting will be on Friday at 5 pm in the usual spot. 

Rick Durowski says that there will be open tennis doubles this 
Quarter, which brings up the possibility of a BJ Ki ng-Chrissie Evert team 
knocking off a John Newcombe-Jimmy onners team . Or even a BJ 
King-Bobby Riggs vs . Chrissie and Jimmy. Anyway, if ~ike such e -
citem nt, the meeting is on Friday at 5 pm . 

There hav been some major changes in the rules of coed basketball , 
most of whi h hould make the game a little more competitive for the

Mitchell Sparks Victory 

Tritons Annihilate AP, 101-74 
by Bert Lee and Kirk RobiJlf .,n 

Mallory Mitchell came off the 
bench, scored 19 points, set a 
school record with 10 assists and 
sparked the UCSD Tritons to a 
101-74 victory over Azsa Pacific 
Wondav night 

Mitchell entered the game 
parl y In the first half when ALUsa 
Pacific was threatening to blow 
the Tritons off the court in what 
was then a seesaw battle. Mit-
chell kept th e Tritons in th gamp 
with some parkling ball handling 
and ('xcellcnt hustle all over the 
(ourt. Mit hpll had seven of hi 
tcn assists in the fir t half 

The Tritons were able to pull to 
a 45-41 halftime lead on the 
strength of a three guard offense 
and som e superb shoot ing 
Mitchell, Steve Kircher, and Tony 
M:Jore took UCSD from a 33-28 
deficit to 45-39 leaq just before 
the half . 

In the second half UCSD 
literally blew the Cougars off the 
court as they quickly jumped to a 
ten point lead, faltered a bit , then 
ran the lead up to its final margin 
of 27 . 

Again it was Mitchell who gave 
the team a lift when he entered 
the game. Azusa Pacific had 
narrowed the gap to six points 
with 13 minutes left in the game 
on the strength of a 1-3-1 press 
that had caught the Tritons a little 
oft-guard . 

Mitchell solved the problem 
immediately An assist to Paul 
Trainer and a spectacular off-
balan ce layin gave the Tritons a 
nine-point lead that was never 
seriously threatened 

rrom then on , it was Mitchell , 
George Calhoun, Trainer and Tom 

Taylor . Trainer and Taylor were 
devastating inside and on the 
boards, eating up the Azusa 
Pacific press with easy layin 
scores and limiting the Cougars to 
one shot on offense. Trainer 
finished with a game high of 27 
points, 19 in the second half . 
Taylor came off the bench in 
replacement of Lyle Smith to 
score 15 points. 

George Calhoun played his 
usual steady game, getting 16 
points, many off of the generous 
feeds of Mallory Mitchell. 

Defen sively , thi S wa s th e 
Tritons best effort yet. They 
limited the Cougars to only sixty 
shots from the floor (as compared 
to their 76), and it is to Azusa 

Pacific's credit that they werE' 
able to makE' fift y pC'rcpnt o f 
them and ,tay In th gamE' a" long 
as they did Jim porleder INf Ilw 
Cougars With 22 points, hitting /l 
of 10 shot from th field 

The win over A2usa PaCific wa s 
the team's third in a row, as well as 
the third time in three games the 
team has gone over the century 
mark in scoring The victory 
placed the Tritons record at 2-0 In 
league play and 6-6 overall

by Kirk Robinson 

Needless to say, Barry Cunningham was pleased with Monday nights 
101-74 victory over Azusa Pacific. 

He was pleased with all phases of the game, parti cu larly the defense 
Cunningham said, " It was our best defensive effort of the season " The 
Tritons played a tight, agressive man to man defen e that forced 
numerous Cougar turnovers and limited Azusa Pacific to only si xty 
shots from the field . 

OffenSively, Cunningham felt the team ran the offense " real well " 
In commenting on Mallory Mitchell , the spark that lifted the Tritons 

to victory, Cunningham said, "Mitchell is the person th at gets us going 
He is a totally un elf ish ballplayer." 

Not to be overlooked was th e play of Paul Tral nero Trainer led the 
team with 27 points and dom inated the boards at both ends of the 
court. Cunningham felt, "Trainer IS plaY ing every phase 'of the 'amp 
well, defense and rebounding as well as scor ing" 

lyle Smith and Tom Taylor, the team's centers are cont inuing to 
improve. It was Taylor's "best game" since a knee inlUry a month ago 

Oll y one asp ct of the game displeased Cunningham He felt the 
team's shot se lection was somewhat poor. But rea ll y, who can argue 
with 57 percpnt shoot ing'

with a zero balance, so you don't /, 
have to close it in June, reopen it in 
the fall. 
Personalized College Plan Checks 
are included at a very low cost. Scenic or 
other style checks for a little more. 

BankAmerlcard~ Next, if you're a qualified student of 
sophomore standing or higher, you can also get 
BankAmericard. Use it for tuition at state universities, for 
check cashing identification and everyday purchases. Con-
servative credit limits help you start building a good credit 
history. 
Overdraft Protection. This part of the package helps you 

avoid bounced checks, by covering 
all your checks up to a prearranged limit. 

Educational Loans. Details on 
Studyplan® and Federally In-
sured loans are available from 
any of our Student Loan 

Offices. 
Accounts. All 

our plans provide easy 
ways to save up for holi-

days and vacations. 
Student Represent-
atives. Finally, the Col-

lege Plan gives you individual 
help with your banking problems_ 

Usually students or recent gradu-
ates themselves, our Reps are located 

at all our .major college offices and are 
easy to talk with. 

Now that you know what's included, why 
not drop by one of our college offices, meet you: Student 
Rep, and get in our College Plan. It'll make your banking a 
lot easier. 

Depend on us. More California college 
students do.
