Preuss School 
Under Fire in 
Grade Change 

Scandal
By Matthew L’Heureux
News Editor

Multiple allegations of grade irregu-
larities at the Preuss School, UCSD’s 
nationally recognized charter school 
for low-income 
students, have 
spurred univer-
sity officials to 
initiate a com-
prehensive audit 
to examine three 
to four years 
worth of the 
school’s academic 
records.

Investigators 
within UCSD’s 
Audit and Management Advisory 
Services have been analyzing claims of 
grading improprieties since mid-June, 
when Cecil Lytle, former Thurgood 
Marshall College provost and current 
chair of the Preuss School Board of 

So Now 
‘What’s 
Next?’

While the idea of raising and 
allocating over $1 billion may seem 
like a daunting task, UCSD has 
recently joined the ranks of 33 other 
American universities that have 
done exactly that.

Nearly a month ahead of sched-
ule, the campus met and surpassed 
its billion-dollar goal in June, cul-
minating a seven-year fundraising 
drive to improve all facets of the

Students Arrive to a Campus in Progress

IRS Probes Campus Finances in Rare Audit

By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer

After a summer dedicated to 
both expanding UCSD’s existing 
facilities and constructing new ones, 
a total of 27,500 students — includ-
ing 4,100 freshmen and 1,650 new 
transfer students — will arrive Sept. 
27 to test the limits of the already 
cluttered campus.

In John Muir College, 452 out of 
585 housed students will be living 
in a triple room, a fact that was met 
with mixed reactions by students.

“I was originally on the waiting 
list, so I was pretty happy about 
being put anywhere [even in a 

triple],” Muir freshman Michelle 
Sorochan said. “I’ve had my own 
room my entire life, so I’m not used 
to cramped spaces, and sharing a 
bathroom will probably be incon-
venient. But I am an only child so I 
want to be around as many people 
as possible.”

The Internal Revenue Service 
recently broke ground on an extensive 
and detailed audit of UCSD’s 2005 pay-
roll information, a relatively uncom-
mon procedure among universities 
that has nevertheless been character-
ized as routine by campus officials.

“While it is not unusual for UCSD 
to be audited by outside nonprofit 
entities like granting agencies, UCSD 
has not had frequent audits by the 
IRS,” UCSD Deputy Director of 
University Communications Dolores 
Davies said in an e-mail. “We can 
only assume that the reason for the 
audit is that UCSD was just selected 
at this time on some random basis.”

Specifically, the IRS is reviewing 
taxes remitted on compensation and 
benefits of higher-level administra-
tors, athletic coaches and a sample 
research unit, Davies said. The IRS 
will also be looking at accounts pay-
able, student accounting and other 
payroll-related transactions in an 
attempt to verify that tax information 

was properly reported to the federal 
government.

IRS spokesman Raphael Tulino 
had no comment regarding the audit, 
and would neither confirm nor deny 
that an audit was even taking place.

But Marvin Friedlander, the chief 
of the IRS’ exempt-organizations 
technical branch — which oversees 
colleges and universities — told the 
San Diego Union-Tribune last month 
that the IRS currently audits public 
universities when it believes business 
income or employment taxes are not 
being properly reported.

Friedlander said that only about a 
dozen private universities are in the 
process of being audited, and that the 
number of public universities is even 
smaller.

UCSD’s audit is unrelated to 
a larger plan enacted last year by 
the IRS to more critically examine 
how colleges and universities report 
income generated from activities 
deemed by the agency as unrelated 
to their academic missions, including 
travel tours, intellectual property and 
advertising revenue generated from 
sporting events and television shows. 

Set to begin next year, the IRS has 
not yet decided how many campuses 
will receive questionnaires as part 
of “mini-audits.” Depending on the 
information the academic institution 

provides to the IRS, it could later be 
selected for a full audit.

Friedlander said that complaints 
by businesses were part of the reason 
that the IRS decided to revamp its 
policies regarding exempt organiza-
tions, which in addition to universi-
ties include hospitals and political 
action committees.

“We’ve had complaints from some 
businesses that felt there is unfair 
competition with universities, in the 
area of travel tours and the produc-
tion of TV shows and movies,” he 
said. “Some businesses felt that there 
was not a level playing field. This is a 
way for us to look and see if there’s a 
problem.”

The last time UCSD — which files 
a consolidated annual tax return for 
nonprofit entities — was scrutinized 
by the IRS was about 10 years ago as 
part of a UC-wide audit of unrelated 
business income.

The current audit should be fin-
ished by March 2008, Davies said, 
because IRS representatives are usu-
ally on campus only about three to 
four days per month while university 
finance staff members continue to 
gather information for them based on 
formal requests.

Chairman’s 
Critique Sparks 
Big Plans for 

UC Restructuring
By Jaclyn Snow
Senior Staff Writer

In a report critical of the 
University of California’s operations 
released last month, UC Board of 
Regents Chairman Richard Blum 
called for an administrative over-
haul and new oversight of univer-
sity affairs, which he said has not 
occurred in 40 years.

In the six-page report, titled “We 
Need to be Strategically Dynamic,” 
Blum called the system “an outmod-
ed and dysfunctional set of organi-
zational structures, processes and 
policies,” and subsequently proposed 
dramatic changes to make the uni-
versity more managerially efficient. 
Blum’s suggestions include higher 
pay for faculty, funding scholarships 
to cover rising tuition and living 
costs, cutting duplicate staff posi-
tions and streamlining operations

Scripps Patient Alleges 

Abuse by Doctor

Officials at Scripps Memorial 
Hospital La Jolla have confirmed 
that Maurice Buchbinder, a promi-
nent cardiologist, allegedly hit a 
patient several times during a pro-
cedure, resulting in his indefinite 
suspension.  

Buchbinder and Scripps 
Memorial are under a federal 
investigation after several lab 
technicians witnessed the alleged 
abuse and filed a complaint with 
state licensing officials.

According to a statement from 
Scripps Memorial, the complaint 
concerned a patient who under-
went a procedure that involved 
threading a tube through coronary 
arteries to detect and unblock var-
ious obstructions. Some patients 
become unruly and combative 
during the procedures and, in such 
rare cases, it is common to use 
arm or leg restraints to prevent 
patients from injuring themselves 
or others.  

Instead of standard proto-
col, however, witnesses said 
Buchbinder hit the patient repeat-
edly over different parts of the 
body to keep the patient from mov-
ing.  His actions were described 
as “abuse” and “assault.” 

“I can confirm the suspension 
and that there is an investigation 
under way,” Scripps spokesper-
son Don Stanziano said in the 
statement.

Buchbinder is accused of vio-
lating standards of care estab-
lished by the federal Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
prompting a team of investigators 

for Medicare and the state to visit 
the hospital.

 
UCSD Plans to Build New 
Cancer Treatment Center

UCSD officials have announced  
plans to develop a proton and par-
ticle therapy cancer treatment cen-
ter.

More precise than traditional X-
ray radiation treatments, proton and 
particle therapy enables doctors to 
better target and destroy cancerous 
tumors.

Faculty members at UCSD’s 
Moores Cancer Center are develop-
ing models for the treatment center, 
which would cost about $125 mil-
lion and could possibly be built next 
to UCSD Medical Center and the 
Moores Cancer Center.

“I am thrilled that we have taken 
the first steps toward building a 
proton treatment center here at UC 
San Diego,” professor and chair of 
the UCSD department of radiation 
oncology Arno Mundt said in a 
press release. “The development of 
such a center would place UCSD 
alongside other major cancer cen-
ters that have built proton cen-
ters.”

Proton and particle therapy 
are available at only a few clinics 
nationwide.  Over the next several 
months, plans for the project will 
be submitted to the UC Board of 
Regents for preliminary consider-
ation, according to university offi-
cials.

The heavy costs to build the 
treatment center, with an estimated 
patient capacity of 1,500 people 
per year, forces university officials 
to seek a private-sector partner.

who signed up for a double last year 
but was assigned a triple due to an 
influx of freshmen, said that room-
ing with two students in a triple was 
not as bad as he thought.

“When I first realized that I had 
two roommates, I was annoyed,” 
Gabriel said. “I went [online] to see 
if I was the only one, but apparently 
every other person had two room-
mates too, so I didn’t feel so bad. I 
think my biggest worry was privacy 
and space. Turns out, it wasn’t so 
bad.”

Much like the undergraduate 
dorms, new graduate housing facili-
ties is also in popular demand, with 
the 800 new beds completely filled 
and a waitlist of about 900 graduate 
students, according to Housing and 
Dining Services Director Mark P.  
Cunningham.

Overall, UCSD houses just over 
10,100 students, which is approxi-
mately 37 percent of the campus’ 
student population.

Students and staff on cam-
pus during the summer may have 
noticed that construction has 
impaired access to some areas, par-
ticularly in the cramped Student 
Center.

According to University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino, access 
through  Student Center has been 
cut off since the middle of June in 
order to accommodate construction 
to create a courtyard. He said he 
hopes to offer limited access during 
Welcome Week so students can pass 
through the new central plaza. 

Terzino said that the first stage 
of the Student Center facelift is 
complete, which includes the reno-
vation of the General Store Co-
op, A.S. Soft Reserves, A.S. Lecture 
Notes, the UCSD Bike Shop, the

inside the UC administration.
“Why is it so hard to make 

broad-scale progress toward our 
goals?” Blum said in the report. “I 
believe the fundamental problem 
is an overgrown UC administra-
tive infrastructure that substitutes 
motion for progress.”

The Aug. 22 report was released 
about a week after UC President 
Robert C. Dynes announced his 
resignation, following a tenure rife 
with bureaucratic inefficiencies and 
a secret pay scandal. Despite the 
timing of Blum’s release, officials 
from the UC Office of the President 
deny a causal link between the two.

“Dynes has stated that he 
intended to spend about five years 
as president and that his desire to 
spend more time with his new wife 
was a further prompt to announce 
his resignation,” UCOP spokesman 
Brad Hayward said.

UC Provost Wyatt R. Hume, who 
took over the role of chief opera-
tional officer after Dynes’ announce-
ment, responded to Blum’s report 
with a letter of praise and outlined 
measures to be taken to address 
some of the suggestions.

“Work already is underway on 
the vast majority of the issues iden-
tified in the papers authored by both 
Chairman Blum and Provost Hume,” 
Hayward said. “UC is an institution 
of extraordinary academic accom-
plishment, and we want to make 
sure its administrative systems and 
processes meet the same high stan-
dards.”

Besides calls for more efficien-
cy and accountability within the 
administration, Blum also focused 
on the need to revamp external rela-
tions with alumni and media as well 
as state officials.

California’s budget for the UC 
system has dropped to 3 percent 
from 7.5 percent over the last two 
decades, coupled with a 40-percent 
decrease in the state’s subsidy per 
student.

“We cannot allow this to con-
tinue,” Blum said.

The university keeps certain lev-
els of money in its reserves and caps  
the amount of debt it can accumu-
late, both of which Blum argues 
should be adjusted to free up money 
for backlogged projects. In response, 
Hume appointed Executive Vice 
President Katherine Lapp to exam-
ine the current system and provide 
a report by November.

Blum also recommended creat-
ing a scholarship of up to $1 billion 
to alleviate rising tuition and living 
costs. Hume placed UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Robert Birgeneau as 
head of a high-level committee that 
will report on its findings for “bold 
and practical alternatives” to stu-
dent expenses in January 2008.

Blum’s message was reinforced on 
Sept. 14, when the Monitor Group, an 
independent agency hired by UCOP 
to assist the university in improv-
ing efficiency, called for system wide 
“operational and structural improve-
ments.” The new report cited many 
of the same problems that Blum 
addressed, including duplicate jobs, 
public distrust and inflexibility to 
changing conditions.

Unlike Blum’s, however, the 
Monitor report uses specific exam-
ples on processes that need to be 
changed, providing the joint UC-
Monitor Group “organizational 
restructuring effort” with clear goals 
to obtain.

The UC system views these two 
reports as a welcome directive to 
modernize its operations.

“Given the funding constraints 
facing the university, it makes sense 
to take a close look at our admin-
istrative operations and streamline 
them where possible,” Hayward 
said.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  11

Directors, received the first of numer-
ous allegations of inappropriate grade 
recording.

Lytle said he immediately contacted 
AMAS to initiate the audit, citing a 
desire to preserve the school’s reputa-
tion as a groundbreaking experiment 
in public education. The Preuss School 
is well known for achieving high test 
scores among mostly underprivileged 
minority students, and was labeled the 
ninth best high school in the nation by 
Newsweek magazine in May.

“I wanted the best professional review 
team to do this,” Lytle said. “Because 
we’re a model, we need to make sure that 
the model is squeaky clean.”

AMAS Director Stephanie Burke 
said that accusations of grade tamper-
ing are unusual, and that auditors care-
fully analyze all claims of wrongdoing 
to determine the depth of the subse-
quent investigation.

“Allegations of misconduct are not 
common,” she said in an e-mail. “When 
such allegations arise, UCSD assess-
es the nature of the allegations made 
and performs a brief or more in-depth 
review as appropriate.”

As summer progressed, Lytle said 
he received even more complaints of 
misconduct, some reported anony-
mously. In the course of their investiga-
tion, AMAS auditors discovered other 
transcripts with grade inconsistencies 
— numbering between 68 and 100 in 
total — over the last three to four years. 

Some students’ course grades were 
reportedly raised or lowered, and other 
students were given grades for classes 
they had not taken, Lytle said.

The school generates approximately 
13,860 course grades per year, mean-
ing the affected grades would amount 
to less than 0.5 percent of last year’s 
marks. Lytle added that a “bulk” of the 
questionable grades involved an online 
course taken over the summer, which is 
being closely analyzed by the auditors.

The initial investigation led to one 
staff member’s termination, according 
to a Sept. 12 memo that Lytle wrote to 
fellow board members. He declined to 
elaborate on the situation, saying only 
that the employee had been fired for 
“unprofessional conduct.”

On Sept. 12, Preuss Principal Doris 
Alvarez and her son-in-law, senior 
counselor Phil Ensberg, were placed 
on paid leave pending the results of the 
audit. Alvarez, an acclaimed educator, 
was awarded National Principal of the 
Year in 1997.

Lytle emphasized that although 
both Alvarez and Ensberg were also 
anonymously accused, the decision to 
place the two on leave was not an impli-
cation of any wrongdoing. 

Burke agreed that placing accused 
administrators on leave is common 
practice to ensure that the audit is rec-
ognized as impartial.

“Investigatory leave is generally 
used in cases where allegations are of 
a serious nature, and it is determined 

that the investigation should proceed 
without any appearance of influence by 
management,” she said.

Vice Principal and Dean of Students 
Scott Barton is serving as interim prin-
cipal until the matter is resolved.

Lytle described the anonymous 
nature of some of the allegations as 
“suspicious,” and said that he believes 
the school’s reputation may have played 
a role in its becoming a target for 

detractors.
“Had this been just another failing 

urban school, no one would have made 
these accusations,” he said.

 Lytle said that one of the allega-
tions was made by a staff member who 
had been fired, but did not specify if 
this was the same employee terminated 
after the original investigation. AMAS 
is also investigating a claim that certain 
teachers were allegedly pressured by 
Preuss administrators to alter grades.

If any of the allegations are proven, 
Lytle said that the school will take 

action as necessary.
“I’m not worried about the results 

of the audit,” he said. “In fact, I’m 
looking forward to seeing it. Even if 
we find something that’s gone wrong, 
we’ll fix it.”

UCSD co-charters the Preuss 
School with the San Diego Unified 
School District, which is responsible 
for verifying that the school remains 
in line with its objectives and mission 
statement. Moises Aguirre, manager 
of charter schools at SDUSD’s Office 
of School Choice, said that his office 
was not made aware of the audit until 
Sept. 10, though it had received similar 
anonymous calls during the summer. 
He said the most recent allegation was 
made approximately two weeks ago.

“We’re monitoring the situation 
right now,” Aguirre said. “At this point, 
we don’t want to make any assump-
tions. We want to see the results before 
we take any action.”

According to the district’s Web site, 
a school’s charter may be revoked if it 
fails to adhere to its operational goals.

As the investigation continues, 
Preuss parents, students and faculty are 
anticipating the impact these allega-
tions — and ultimately, the findings of 
the audit — will have on the school’s 
reputation.

“I sadly believe the school’s reputa-
tion is already damaged, regardless of 
the results of the investigation,” Preuss 
parent Maru Cham, whose daughter 
graduated last spring, said in an e-

mail. “People reading the news may 
not remember that the audit is talking 
about less than 0.1 percent of the grades 
being altered. They may just keep in 
their minds ‘altered grades at Preuss’ 
and that is it.”

Cham, an active member of the 
school’s parent council for several 
years, said that she trusts Alvarez, Lytle 
and the board of directors to handle the 
situation appropriately.

“If an anomaly is proven, my rea-
soning tells me to keep in mind that 
we are all humans, [and] susceptible to 
mistakes and lessons to learn,” she said. 
“Mistakes do not take away a legacy of 
many successes and great results.”

A.S. President Marco Murillo, a 
2004 Preuss graduate, said he is opti-
mistic that the school’s standing in the 
community will remain unblemished.

“I think it is too early to jump to 
any conclusion on the future reputation 
of Preuss,” Murillo said. “In only eight 
years, Preuss has become a very pres-
tigious school, and I believe the school 
will continue to carry on its mission.”

Neither Murillo nor Cham said 
they witnessed any grade irregularities 
during their time at the school, though 
Cham said she did hear rumors of 
possible discrepancies during spring 
quarter.

Burke said that the results of the 
audit are expected next month.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  13

UCSD experience.
Funds from the campaign, titled 

“The Campaign for UCSD: Imagine 
What’s Next,” are being used to pay 
for scholarships, fellowships, aca-
demic programs, research, faculty 
recruitment and retention, as well 
as improvements to other campus 
infrastructures and services. 

The largest allotment of the cam-
paign funds, $400 million, will be 
distributed to support specific fields 
in faculty research that include 
health sciences, engineering, the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
and the physical and biological sci-
ences. Donors will determine how 
their funds are to be used.

Approximately another $330 mil-
lion, or 33 percent, will be allotted 
to academic programs and facilities 
— 10 percent to meet the univer-
sity’s highest priority needs and 7 
percent for faculty support.

Donors have provided support 
for hundreds of students, with con-
tributions of more than $100 mil-
lion that will be available through 
various organizations on campus. 

With rising costs of tuition, 
scholarships funded by the cam-
paign have helped students bridge 
the gap between college expenses 
and financial aid limitations.

“[This] can be the deciding factor 
in whether a student attends UCSD 
— or if he or she attends college at 
all,” Associate Vice Chancellor of 
University Communications Stacie 
A. Spector said.

Earl Warren College senior 
Beatrice Salcido received the Buzz 
Wooley and Ann Parode Scholarship 
— funded by the campaign — before 
her freshman year in 2004.

“It was the most influential part 
in my decision to choose UCSD 
as the university I would attend,” 
Salcido said. “I would have had to 
cut my education short [and] drop 
out after two years.”

Another campaign benefi-
ciary, Earl Warren College sopho-
more Kenneth Wong, received the 
Alumni-Regent Scholarship.

“This scholarship meant a lot 
because I have two sisters in college,” 
Wong said. “For our family it’s a time 
of lots of education, but much expense. 
Receiving this scholarship has helped 
me take care of my own tuition costs.”

Wong said he was very impressed 
by the campaign’s success.

“I find it amazing how much 
work and dedication the UCSD 
community put into raising the 
money for such things as scholar-

ships,” he said.
The campaign also bolstered 

UCSD’s reputation in the gradu-
ate school community with the 
creation of two new graduate 
schools — the Rady School of 
Management, which was just relo-
cated to Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
and the Skaggs School of Pharmacy 
and Pharmaceutical Sciences. A 
$30-million donation from the 
Skaggs Institute for Research helped 
to secure the future of the Skaggs 
School, the only public pharmacy 
school in Southern California.

“When we launched ‘The 
Campaign for UCSD,’ even our 
fundraising consultants said that a 
$1-billion campaign might be too 
ambitious for a university not yet 

50 years old,” Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox said in a press release. 
“But with the support of generous 
alumni, parents, faculty and staff, 
students and friends, we achieved 
the extraordinary.”

At a celebratory event in June, 
Fox acknowledged that there is still 
a need for continuous fundraising 
efforts to finance more undergradu-
ate and graduate scholarships and 
student life initiatives and to recruit 
and retain faculty.

“With higher education’s share 
of state revenue declining each year, 
UCSD — as with other public uni-
versities — must increasingly rely 
on gifts from alumni, parents and 
friends,” Spector said. 

Currently, only 12 percent of 
UCSD’s operating budget comes 
from the state of California.

Of the $1.03 billion raised, 51 
percent came from friends of the 
university contributors who had not 
attended UCSD 28 percent from 
alumni and 14 percent from par-
ents. Various corporations, founda-
tions and organizations donated the 
remaining 7 percent.

In September, Keith Brant 
stepped down as UCSD’s vice chan-
cellor of external relations — the 
position that oversaw the fundrais-
ing campaign — in order to “pur-
sue other business interests.” UC 
Senior Vice President of Business 
and Finance emeritus V. Wayne 
Kennedy was appointed as Brant’s 
interim replacement. However, nei-
ther the chancellor’s office nor uni-
versity communications mentioned 
any side effects caused by the tran-
sition.

Though no date has been set for 
the launch of UCSD’s next cam-
paign, Fox said that it will focus on 
increasing donations from corpora-
tions and foundations.

ready in a few weeks — and two 
unisex bathrooms on the second 
floor.

The second stage involves the 
creation of the central plaza, the 
renovation of the General Store’s 
old site to create a permanent space 
for Groundwork Books and cre-
ation of additional indoor seat-
ing at the Grove Caffe. The sec-
ond phase is nearing completion 
and should be finished by October, 
Terzino said. Additionally, this 
stage includes the renovation of the 
UCSD Craft Center classroom and 
the area between the grassy “hump” 
and Student Center.

Terzino said the job should be 
completed during Winter Quarter 
as part of its final, and shortest, 
stage, which involves utility work 
along the breezeway running from 
the Food Co-op to the parking lot 
as well as final landscaping and 
cleaning.

The goal for the completion of 
the much-anticipated Price Center 
expansion is also winter quarter, 
although there is no definitive date 
set, he said.

“With such a large-scale con-
struction project, it is very hard to 
pin down an exact date until you’re 
within a month or two of comple-
tion,” Terzino said. 

Although the project itself is not 
yet complete, many construction 
sites have already finished, includ-
ing the new ATM pavilion and 
repaving of adjacent Mandeville 
Walk. Such changes will allow stu-
dents better access to Price Center, 
the UCSD bookstore addition and 
Perks, the new coffee shop located 
inside the bookstore.

Price Center Expansion Project 
Manager Jay Smith said that con-
struction delays usually happen on 
a weekly basis for comparably large 
building projects, but having a good 
team of architects and designers has 
helped to resolve any problems. 

“[Our construction team is doing] 
an outstanding job of keeping the 
project on track, schedule-wise, and 
helping to solve any big problems,” he 
said. “I would say that the universi-
ty’s vision of the project has actually 
not only been maintained, but also 
improved through everyone’s efforts 
during construction.” 

The Stuart Collection is adding a 
large mural art piece to Price Center’s 
central atrium, and the Student 
Affairs Office is also working on a 
“Triton Sculpture” to add as a campus 
mascot near the grand stairs.

Smith also said that the university 
events and Student Affairs offices are 
working on adding an intimate music 
venue similar to a restaurant or night-
club. The space will be outfitted by 
some of the people who have created 
the hippest restaurant interiors in 
town, he added. 

Although no major obstacles have 
occurred amid construction to hinder 
the project, Smith said that the biggest 
problem — industry inflation that 
forced them to limit the expansion of 
the Price Center — that happened at 
the very beginning. However, he said 
that things have gone much more 
smoothly since then.

STUDENT CENTERS AND 
HEALTH — On July 16, The 
U.S. News and World Report hit 
newsstands with its annual “Best 
Hospitals” issue. The Moores 
Cancer Center, along with five 
other specialty centers at UCSD 
Medical Center, ranked as one of 
the best medical facilities in the 
country — and with its advanced 
treatment for patients and continu-
ally groundbreaking research, it’s 
easy to see why. 

Recently, the Moores Center has 
been making plans that will likely 
boost its position even farther up 
the ranks as one of the best cancer 
treatment centers in the nation, 
as the UCSD Medical Center is 
making plans to establish a center 
for proton and particle therapy to 
treat their future cancer patients. 
Unfortunately, the estimated cost of 
building such a facility isn’t cheap. 
Including technology costs, the 
price tag for a proton therapy cen-

ter typically exceeds $125 million, 
which raises issues as to whether 
the endeavor would be a good use 
of university funds.

Currently, UCSD is developing 
a model for a collaborative venture 
with private parties who would help 
finance and construct the new can-
cer center building, which, when 
completed, is planned to include 
additional floors of laboratory 
space devoted to cancer research. 

So, would spending such a great 
deal of money on this innovative 
cancer technology be a valuable 
investment for UCSD Medical 
Center? Judging from recent 
reports on proton therapy, having 
such technology available at the 
Medical Center would be incred-
ibly beneficial for UCSD and its 
potential patients seeking cancer 
treatment as well. 

Proton therapy, for those unfa-
miliar with the process, is a type 
of external beam radiotherapy in 
which positively-charged particles 
from atoms are directed at lesions 
and tumors, strategically destroying 
cancerous cells. Typically, surgery 
or a different type of radiotherapy, 
called x-ray therapy, is used to treat 
cancer patients; however, proton 
therapy has a greater advantage in 
effectively treating cancer in com-
parison to these typical methods. 

Having proton therapy available 
as a potentially safer and more pre-

cise cancer treatment would likely 
attract many patients seeking an 
alternative to conventional 
cancer treatments and 
therapies. The main 
advantage of pro-
ton therapy over 
surgery and x-
ray radiation 
therapy is that 
protons have 
a less harmful 
impact on tis-
sue surround-
ing tumors, while 
still destroying 
cancer on a micro-
scopic level. Unlike 
x-rays, protons deposit 
a substantially smaller 
amount of energy into 
the body, specifi-
cally targeting can-
cerous tumors 
and avoiding 
extensive radio-
active damage 
to healthy cells 
in the body. In 
this way, proton 
therapy can reduce 
complications and improve 
the quality of life for patients 
who undergo this treatment. 

According to UCSD researchers, 
proton therapy is especially effec-

I t’s that time of year again: the first week of school.For some, this signifies an 
unwelcome kick back into lectures 
and exams. For others, it recalls 
the overwhelming excitement that 

comes with organizing fresh school 
supplies. And for others still, the 
start of school means an opportu-
nity to see old friends and make 
new ones. 

But just as the start of each ele-
mentary school year was marked by 
that awkward photo opportunity in 
the front yard, the start of college 
each fall is marked by big cardboard 
moving boxes. Whether you’re 
returning to UCSD for your sixth 
— and hopefully final — year or 
you’re a not-yet-so-jaded freshman, 
chances are that between buying 
books and mingling with friends, 
you’ll spend these next few days 
unpacking. 

I’ve already navigated the car-
packing, heavy-shit-carrying, deep-
cleaning, goodbye-saying chaos of 
moving six times. And if there’s one 
thing I’ve learned — well, other than 
don’t try to hide a dog in a no-pets 
apartment — it’s to invest in a foam 
mattress pad. No seriously, living on 
campus likely means a decade-old 
dorm bed. And if you’ve recently 
moved off campus, you’re probably 
like me and opted for the cheapest 
thing available. A foam pad trans-

FINANCE — Since last April, 
when the University of California 
began a $7-million project aimed 
at unearthing the system’s end-
less and increasingly glaring defi-
ciencies, a bubbling curiosity has 
been brewing at the various UC 
campuses. 

Headed by the Monitor Group, 
an independent Massachusetts 
consulting firm, these restruc-
turing efforts were originally an 
attempt to regain some of the 
credibility lost after the infamous 
pay scandals in 2005. The UC 
Board of Regents promised that 
the project would provide a much-
needed cure to a long-standing 
illness. It is no wonder then, with 
a multi-million dollar price tag, 
that the public was eagerly and 
hesitantly awaiting the results of 
the project’s first phase, released 
earlier this month. 

And where would the report 
place the blame for rampant mis-
management and inefficiency? 
More importantly, would it finally 
bring some hopeful resolve to the 
system’s disappointing and tumul-
tuous past? The answers were bit-
tersweet. 

The report rightfully berated 

the UC Office of the President for 
its conservative, almost dictatorial 
style of management, its inabil-
ity to “meet campus needs,” its 
complete failure to spend money 
efficiently or effectively, its neglect 
to resolve the dearth of informa-
tion technology resources, its 
uncooperativeness with the state 
legislature — the list goes on and 
on. But in its overly narrow focus, 
the report left the regents look-
ing like the innocent bystanders 
while UC President Robert Dynes 
underhandedly tried to sabotage 
the administration.

Reality, however, provides a 
stark contrast. The regents were 
just as much the guilty party in 
mucking up administrative func-
tions as was Dynes. Their latest 
attempt to pin the blame on the 
president is just another in a series 
of antics to resign themselves from 
the public eye. It would be so 
convenient to dump the mess on 
Dynes’ legacy — especially now 
that he has announced his resig-
nation — claim innocence and 
finally start fresh. But, thankfully, 
the public is not that stupid. 

While it’s disappointing the 
report would overlook the regents’ 
failures, it is not difficult to see

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — In an dis-
appointing decision for many students and 
parents, the UC Board of Regents last week 
approved drastic fee increases for the various 
UC professional schools, citing an impending 
need to improve quality and offer the competi-
tive faculty salaries needed to 
maintain the excellence for 
which UC graduate schools 
are known. 

But before students jump 
the gun and assume the typi-
cally-frivolous regents are 
once again to blame for their 
mounting debts, they should 
realize that, this time, it was 
actually the state that turned 
its back on California’s stu-
dents.

Since 2001 the UC system 
has faced continuous budget 
cuts that have forced it to 
adopt fee increases for both its undergradu-
ate and graduate programs. Between 2003-04 
former Gov. Gray Davis slashed the UC budget 
an astounding $410 million, resulting in cuts to 
nearly every nook and cranny of the UC system. 
Between 2004-05 the professional schools took 
another hit when the state cut their funding by 
an additional $42 million.

As last week’s meeting indicated, the ripple 
effect of these state decisions is still being felt 
— and most profoundly among students, many 
of whom will be forced to make difficult deci-
sions regarding their education. 

And despite the regents’ concerted efforts 
to highlight the plan’s attention to boosting 
financial affordability through additional finan-
cial aid, the plan will no doubt cut off access to 

advanced degrees for many low-income stu-
dents. Even with the promise of many schools to 
return upward of 30 percent of revenue gener-
ated from the increase to financial aid programs 
and student grants, the tuition fees for many of 
the schools will be simply too high for students 
to bear the cost. 

Furthermore the additional grants offered 
by the UC as a result of this added revenue will 
only cover the entire cost of the fee increase for 
students whose family income is lower than 
$60,000 per year. This would, as a result, force 
families making say, $65,000, to spend nearly 
half of their annual income on their child’s 
tution.

And although the UC Regents voted for 
only steady 7 percent increases in student fees 
for many of the system’s professional schools, 

including medicine, den-
tistry, optometry and nurs-
ing, the system’s law, busi-
ness and pharmacy schools 
will face particularly soar-
ing fees. 

UC Berkeley’s profes-
sional school students, for 
example, can expect a 15 
percent increase in fees 
at its law school and an 
additional 15 percent at its 
business school. 

The UC Regents pre-
dict comparable increases 
will be implemented well 

into 2011. Similarly high rates are planned 
for UCLA as well. The vote also approved 
an approximate annual increase of 11 percent 
for UCSD’s and UC San Francisco’s pharmacy 
schools. 

With hikes like these, the regents are delu-
sional if they believe the envisioned changes to 
financial aid can compensate for what will be 
an average increase of approximately $450 per 
student. Keep in mind that with the University 
of California enrolling approximately 45,884 
graduate students in 2006, that sum is well over 
$20 million. Given that substantial gap, it is 
nearly impossible to trust the burden will not 
be thrust upon students.

State Turns its Back on Students as Graduate Tuition Fees Climb Higher

See STUDENT FEES, page 6

“The ripple effect of these state decisions to cut funding is still being felt — and most  
profoundly among 

students.”

State budget, crunched over a 
decade, forces regents to boost 
future graduate fees across UC 
campuses leaving low-income 
students to bear the cost.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007

By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

ON CAMPUS — As students new and 
old flock to UCSD for Welcome Week 
and the beginning of Fall Quarter, 
they can’t help but be frustrated by 
the continued University Centers con-
struction. Unlike the subtle work being 
done on peripheral buildings, the cur-
rent expansion and renovation of both  
Price Center and Student Center have 
created significant obstacles for stu-
dents frequenting the areas. 

Specifically, Student Center con-
struction has blocked many paths 
to and through facilities. With these 
walkways fenced off seemingly indefi-
nitely, foot traffic has greatly decreased 
— and businesses in the area are feel-
ing the sting. Though students familiar 
with the center are generally excited for 
the renovations to be completed, the 
question now is: When?

Continued delays and apparent 
poor communication between con-
tractors and university administra-
tors have caused the project to lag. 
As a result, businesses and services in 
Student Center are nearly inaccessible, 
and students are left wandering what 
was once a comparatively compact and 
easy-to-navigate space, confusedly ask-
ing for directions.

When the majority of students left 
campus last spring, they left a maze 

of fences blocking off portions of the 
Student Center. While summer work 
included the completion of the first 
stage of the center’s facelift, according 
to University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino, students are returning to find 
things sadly similar to the way they 
left them.

According to Terzino, the first stage 
included renovations for the General 
Store Co-op, A.S. 
Soft Reserves, A.S. 
Lecture Notes, the 
UCSD Bike Shop, 
the Food Co-
op, Student-Run 
Television and two 
unisex bathrooms. 
But Student Center 
inhabitants will 
notice that not 
only are some of 
these changes still 
incomplete, but that those that are 
complete were finished before summer 
even began.

In addition to the completion of 
the unisex bathrooms, General Store 
and Bike Shop employees had already 
moved into their refurbished spac-
es before the end of Spring Quarter. 
Renovations to the Food Co-op’s 
kitchen and store room were com-
pleted over summer, but with the low 
store visibility and severely reduced 
foot traffic caused by the construction 

surrounding both of its entrances, the 
Co-op has taken some of the hardest 
financial hits, and is currently operat-
ing with a substantially limited stock. 
(In fact, a large chunk of remaining 
traffic these businesses have received is 
actually from frustrated students trying 
to create their own walkways through 
the shops.) And though the structure 
housing Soft Reserves, Lecture Notes 

and the new 
home of SRTV 
may be complete, 
access to these 
resources contin-
ues to be blocked 
off entirely. 

When asked 
about the lim-
ited Student 
Center access, 
both Terzino and 
Assistant Vice 

Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. 
Ratcliff said that though much of the 
area continues to be blocked, at least 
the central walkway would be opened 
up by Sept. 24, when undergraduates 
returned to campus for the start of 
Welcome Week.

Unfortunately, this was not the 
case.

Clearly there’s disconnect between 
the guys wearing hard hats and admin-
istrative deadlines and rhetoric. And 
even different contractors had differ-

ent answers to the walkway question: 
Some indicated the walkway was to 
be finished Sept. 27 at the earliest. 
Still, others estimated the first week of 
October. 

Terzino also indicated that the 
second stage — which would open 
up the rest of the Student Center 
passageways — is near comple-
tion and should finish in October, 
with the final touches to the center 
wrapping up in December. But with 
October only a few short weeks 
away — and contractors gossiping 
that their load will continue well 
into the school year — its hard to 
imagine that the much-needed end 
to construction is really so near.

Despite frustration with all the 
construction, employees and habit-
ual visitors of the center remain 
optimistic about the renovations. 
The eventual plaza and reopening 
of walkways will hopefully bring 
more traffic into the space and the 
project’s completion will also mean 
a permanent spot for currently 
floating resources like SRTV and 
Groundwork Books. Unfortunately, 
everyday of delay is more and more 
financially crippling for the campus’ 
vibrant student-run businesses.

The key now is to end the con-
tinual holdup plaguing the project 
and get the Student Center fully 
functioning and back in action.

“It’s hard to imagine that the much-needed end to construction is really so near.”
Despite the vote ending in a 13 to 

6 approval of the increases, several 
regents voiced these pressing con-
cerns at the meeting. 

“We ought not to try to address 
quality concerns on the backs of the 
students,” said Regent Eddie Island. 

Concerned Regents also stressed, 
and rightly so, that the added finan-
cial pressure for low-income students 
would be a backward step on the path 
to diversity — an issue the regents 
have continually pushed in recent 
talks. They opposed the resolution 
saying it would reduce access for the 
state’s minorities seeking advanced 
degrees.  

But even given this negative symp-
tom, the regents are not to blame; this 
time they were just unlucky. They got 
stuck with an empty wallet and an 
angry mob while our state legislators 
are getting off easy.

So if anything positive can be 
said about last week’s decision, its 
that it was an eye opener, a harsh 
reminder that legislative decisions — 
over those made by the UC Regents 
— often have the greatest impact on 
UC education.

where the Monitor analysts went 
wrong. First, they assumed inefficien-
cies within UCOP, solely represented 
a failure on the part of UCOP without 
considering the UC Regents’ integral 
role in the office’s functioning. It was, 
after all, the UC Regents who, year 
after year, approved the annual UC 
budgets that Dynes proposed. Not to 
mention it has been five years since 
Dynes initially took office, giving the 
regents plenty of time to express seri-
ous discontent with his methods of 
leadership. 

But it was 
not merely this 
assumption that 
caused the Monitor 
Group’s analy-
sis to fall short; 
it was also the 
group’s approach. 
According to the 
report, an integral 
part of its evalua-
tion and problem 
diagnosis was 
based on in-depth 
interviews with 
the regents, who would no doubt cast 
themselves in a positive and innocent 
light rather than admitting their own 
shortcomings. 

Had the group taken a deeper 
look at the departments surrounding 
UCOP, it would not have been so quick 
to deem the office the root of all uni-
versity ills and would have found that 
identical problems were shared among 
the various departments, including the 
regents.

For example, the report chastised 
the president’s office for communi-
cation efforts that left much to be 
desired. According to the report “Each 
structural unit within UCOP ... has 
developed over time many of its own 

internal administrative functions. 
Communications between counter-
parts across silos is ad hoc. While 
there is some collaboration, it tends to 
be sporadic.” 

But UCOP was not the only depart-
ment lacking communication among 
its members. The regents have, for a 
long time, also fostered a hush-hush 
culture that no doubt contributed to 
the system’s inefficiency. It was not 
until just last month that this tradi-
tion began to change, after UC Board 
of Regents Chairman Richard Blum 
issued a report outlining his unabashed 

discontent with 
what he called 
a dysfunctional 
administration. 
As President 
of the National 
Center for Public 
Policy and Higher 
Education in San 
Jose, Pat Callan, 
points out occur-
rences like this 
were by no means 
the norm.

“These [prob-
lems] have been elephants in the room 
for so long, and it has been considered 
unseemly for the regents to talk about 
the issues in a public way,” Callan told 
the San Francisco Chronicle on Aug. 
23.

Even with the elephants now gone, 
however, the public should feel only 
marginally better about the state of 
the UC system. After all, the regents 
just wasted $7 million to hear that 
UCOP lacks management and com-
munication skills — not exactly new 
information. Not to mention that in 
doing so they once again highlighted 
their evasive nature, a problem that 
will linger far after Dynes finishes his 
five-year reign.

8  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007

tive in treating cancers of the eye, 
brain, head, neck, lung and pros-
tate. Specifically, proton therapy has 
been gaining a reputation in the 
field of pediatrics, which the cancer 
center plans to specialize in, if it 
is approved. Children can benefit 
significantly from proton therapy 
because the lower radiation dosage 
to healthy tissues is significantly 
reduced in children, also scaling 
back adverse effects on growth and 
development, a typical side-affect of 
other cancer treatments. 

Of course, this good news for 
cancer patients also benefits the 
Moores Center and the UCSD 
Medical Center as a whole. If the 
Medical Center completes its plans 
for proton therapy facilities, UCSD 
Medical Center would be at the 
forefront of this innovative cancer 
treatment technology. Only a hand-
ful of today’s hospitals throughout 
the world offer proton treatment, 
though it is rapidly gaining popu-
larity.

Since the center will be a facil-
ity for both cancer treatment and 
research, focusing on state-of-the-
art treatment as well as the devel-
opment of novel approaches to 
improving the cutting-edge therapy, 

it would become a major resource 
for scientists, engineers and bio-
medical researchers within the cam-
pus community. The research pro-
gram would additionally include the 
investigation of therapeutic applica-
tion of other particles with simi-
lar properties, making the facility 
unique from any other proton ther-
apy center in the country. Having 
such a facility would also benefit 
UCSD Medical School by drawing 
in students who are interested in the 
innovative techniques that the Moores 
Center will be using and researching. 
Therefore, in addition to having more 
resources available for current scien-
tists and engineers, UCSD would be 
making a tremendous investment to 
attract future students and research-
ers — thereby making the $125 mil-
lion money well spent. 

Currently, UCSD is reviewing 
information from potential partners 
to develop a request for propos-
als, and over the next few months 
program officials hope to create 
and submit the project for approval 
by the UC Regents. If this project 
is approved, it could lead to great 
strides, not only for UCSD Medical 
Center, but, more importantly, for 
cancer patients and researchers 
worldwide. 

forms either of these into an instant 
naptime sanctuary.)

But aside from that, I’ve also 
learned of a magical little slice of 
Sweden, right here in San Diego. 
I’d never had the IKEA experience 
before moving down to college, but 
woah — was I in for a treat. With 
countless, colorful showrooms to 
wander through, its own restaurant 
and products all named things like 
Fritz, Norden and Ektorp, the one-
stop Swedish furniture shop is eerily 
similar to an amusement park. 

The gilded entrance of yellow 
and blue leads shoppers up a flight 
of stairs to the second floor and 
beginning of the Swedish tour. 
Shoppers take in rows upon rows 
of kitchen tables, beds and couch-
es in larger themed areas — each 
lined with ornamental example 
rooms — as they wind through a 
neatly-decorated adventure maze. 
(Think of waiting in line for Space 
Mountain or the Indiana Jones ride 
at Disneyland.)

But the fun has only just begun! 
Once you’ve made it through the 
top-floor labyrinth and around to 
the second flight of stairs, you might 
be a little overwhelmed, so take a 
moment to collect yourself and grab 
some authentic Swedish cuisine at 
the mid-way restaurant. 

When you’re done, it’s time to 
move down to the bottom floor 
where the hands-on part of your 
IKEA experience really begins. The 
lower level of the store is similar to 
the top in its adventure-maze-like 
setup. But instead of just looking 
at all the pretty decor possibilities, 
now you get to rifle through every-
thing you didn’t even know you 

needed until you saw it. Bins of 
closet and desk organizers, floppy-
rubber ice cube trays, fake flowers, 
eight-legged octopus hangers and 
more — the chatchkies are endless!

And just as you reach the end 
of that awesome home-accessory 
jungle, you’re in for one more treat: 
the furniture pickup warehouse. 
Remember all those themed rooms 
you traveled through way back on 

the top floor? Now it’s time to go get 
the boxed and dissembled versions 
of your favorite furniture to take 
home. (Think of those cute souvenir 
shops that line Disneyland’s Main 
Street.) 

IKEA even provides special carts 
to help transport your new boxes 
to the cashier station and out to 
your car.

As you make your way to the 
exit, sighing happily after a long 
and exhausting day of fun, you pass 
once more by a few small racks 
of Swedish candy — mjolkchoklad 
yay! — and discount goodies, just 
for good measure.

Although the IKEA experience 
is a unique one that every person 
should have, beware: This house-
wares superstore can be as terrifying 
as it is awesome. IKEA is brilliant 
because it isn’t an amusement park; 
it’s a store. And what might seem 
like an adventure maze is actually a 
clever, and sometimes intimidating, 
marketing scheme to lead customers 
past every item, when all they might 
need is a lamp. 

 All I’m saying is: As the school 
year begins and you settle into your 
new college digs — perhaps set-
ting out upon your very own IKEA 
adventure — may you be armed 
with strength of mind and a good 
foam mattress pad.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS 15.75 Million▶ The population of Cairo according to Demographia.com. Cairo is the sixeenth 

most populous city in the world.

{ }While some students spent their summer making hundreds of frappuccinos, chasing 6-year-olds in the hot sun or filing documents for parents, these three go-getters avoided the physical strains of infamous summer-job bitch work, instead scoring some productive and enjoyable internships.
The Other Summer Job

Company: HEILBrice Marketing 
Communications
Location: Newport Beach, Calif.
How He Got the Job: Admittedly, con-
nections got me in the door, but I had to 
apply and interview just like everyone 
else.
General Responsibilities: Though my 
main role was to assist a handful of 
account executives, or “AE’s,” much 
of my time was spent doing research, 
sitting in on meetings and proofread-
ing. Toward the end of my internship 
(with a little more experience under 
my belt) the company entrusted me 
with co-management of our account 
with the Los Angeles Visitor’s Bureau 
and a greater involvement in our deal-
ings with San Manuel Indian Bingo 
and Casino. Those new responsibilities 
included negotiation of contracts with 
talent and modeling agencies, acquisi-
tion of music licensing for some of 
our commercials and monitoring of 
accounts to make sure we didn’t go 
over-budget.
Perks: Perks grow on trees at a suc-
cessful advertisement agency. Who 
could resist the beautiful coworkers? 
Or looking important during on-loca-
tion shoots, all-expenses-paid ‘power 
lunches’? Or working in one of the 
most exciting, ever-changing indus-
tries around? Plus all the free stuff we 
had strewn about the office — from 
Clippers tickets to Ketel One bottles 

Company: Sound Arts 
Recording Studio 
Location: San Francisco, 
Calif.
How He Got the Job: Over 
Winter Break I scoured Google.com 
for recording studios in the Bay Area, 
I e-mailed almost all of them and got 
a reply back from Sound Arts. When I 
got back for the summer I drove up to 
San Francisco, and was called in for an  
interview.
General Responsibilities: Setting up 
microphones for the sessions, helping out 
with on-the-fly edits, essentially doing 
anything that needed to be done to keep 
a steady flow of recording at the session. 
I help set up and take down instruments 
between takes and would move mics to 
different places in the live room for a 
couple different layers of ambient noise.
Perks: I got in-studio experience and 
access to gear that costs way too much 
for me to ever have in my home record-
ing studio. I also got to work with Bay 
Area musicians like the Otherside, 
Sparklebritches and On 3 Go.

Company: Pressman Film 
Location: Hollywood, Calif.
How He Got the Job: My mom, who is an actress, 
talked to her manager’s assistant, who talked to his 
friend, who hired me.
General Responsibilities: Everyday I walked into my 
office, sat down and my boss had a nice big script or 
two for me. I read the scripts, wrote synopses of them 
and accepted or rejected the script. While I was read-
ing the scripts and forming my synopses, I was also 
answering phones.
Perks: Most people would not think that a company 
intern would have any power because an internship 
is an entry-level position. However, despite being low 
on the totem pole, I had a decent amount of respon-
sibility. Everyday a script was put in front of me; most 
were 100 pages or more that a writer had slaved on 
for weeks, writing and revising constantly. And I had 
to accept or reject the work and explain my decision 
to my supervisor. I was essentially one of the first 
hurdles a writer had to get past if he or she wants their 
screenplay made into a film. Another major perk is 
seeing that your work matters. Two scripts I recom-
mended are going to be produced, if all goes well. This 
is important because I think I only recommended two 
or three screenplays while working for the company.
Bitch Work: Usually there isn’t any. Sometimes I did 
some filing, or help the accountant, but most of the 
time I read scripts.
What He Learned: The main thing I have learned is 

what allows a screenplay to become a movie. There are 
many things a writer has to pay attention to in order 
for a script to be accepted. The way we rate scripts at 
Pressman Film is by looking at several things: story-
line, premise, marketability, characters, dialogue, artis-
tic elements and visual elements. And if a script does 
not rate well on these standards then it’s rejected.
An Interesting Anecdote: There was one weird script 
that I read which got the green light to go into “prepro-
duction”, the next stage in movie making. It was called 
“Little Green Men,” and it was about a talk show host 
realizing the plans of an insect alien invasion; He has 
to stop the invasion before the aliens destroy the world. 
There’s more to the story, but that’s the gist of it. I didn’t 
recommend nor reject the script, but checked “consider” 
on the rubric I was given. If I were to base my decision 
solely on the story, I would have rejected the script. But 
what attracted me to the screenplay was its commercial 
value. In the story, the protagonist uses pesticides like 
‘Raid’ and ‘Blackflag’ to fight against the bug invaders, 
and — if I recall correctly — even the presidents of 
those two companies make a cameo in the script. That is 
product placement, I thought, rivaled only by the movie 
“Transformers.” If Pressman Film made deals with those 
two insect killing companies and others, it could mean 
big bucks for my production company.
Advice to Students Also Looking for an Internship 
in This Field: If you want an internship in the enter-
tainment industry, do yourself a favor and know 
someone in the entertainment industry.

pretty cool too.
Bitch Work: Surprisingly, almost 
none.
What He Learned: I got a priceless, 
intimate glimpse into the fast-paced 
world of making things look good.
An Interesting Anecdote: When I had 
first arrived at HEILBrice, the account 
executive for Ketel One was working 
on a campaign destined for Quebec. 
Opportunely, I speak French, and I 
put my skills to work in dealing with 
the representatives in Montreal and 
making sure the creative department’s 
French language brochures were accu-
rate. It was the moment in which I real-
ized I was finally doing something that 
didn’t require brawn or a heartbeat to 
do — and I was getting paid for it.
Advice to Students Also Looking 
for an Internship in This Field: 
Advertising is an understandably 
popular industry, and as such the 
internships are coveted and competi-
tive. My advice is to be persistent and 
presentable. As they say: to succeed in

Bitch Work: Wrapping cords — appar-
ently all my life I have been wrapping 
cords the wrong way and relearning was 
super hard.
What He Learned: I am now positive 
that I want to be a part of the recorded 
music industry for the rest of my life. 
I also learned about the proper way to 
set up microphones for different instru-
ments [and] about setting up proper sig-
nal chains, using compressors, preamps 
and equalizers.
An Interesting Anecdote: For one of the 
sessions, we needed a preamp that one of 
the studio engineers, whom I had never 
met, had at his apartment. It was my mis-
sion to drive to the intersection closest 
to his apartment, pick this big piece of 
equipment up and come back. I got to the 
intersection and realized that there was 
absolutely no person on any street corner 
holding a preamp. I called and got no 
answer from the number given to me. 

So I parked, put the one quarter I 
had into the meter and ran around this 
intersection, looking for anyone with a 
backpack or duffel bag. I ended up mak-
ing a complete fool of myself by asking 
random people if they had a preamp. I 
called the studio and they said that the 
guy was down the street. I found him, 
loaded up the preamp and got back to my 
car just before the meter ran out.
Advice To Students Also Looking For 
An Internship In This Field: Be persis-
tent.

16 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007

The End
The sound of horns honking, the 

roar of engines and shouting drift-
ed through the window. The heat in 
Cairo was stifling. Smog hung in the 
air like a morning 
fog. From the fifth-
floor balcony of the 
Tulip Hotel, I could 
casually observe the 
madness of Talaat 
Harb Square below.

At midnight, 
Zach O’Neil, a his-
tory major from the 
University of Massachusetts, passed 
in and out of sleep inside room 41 of 
the hotel. 

Arab Hospitality 
We braved the square and nearby 

streets in search of a bank to exchange 
money, choking down exhaust fumes 
and pushing through the bustling 
crowds. Within minutes of leaving the 
hotel, our small group of American 
students was approached by Hassam, 
who offered a helping hand.

Zach and I quicky found ourselves 
sitting on the couches of Hassam’s scent-
ed-oil shop with Lisa Markman and 
Mariela Goett, both UCSD juniors. 

“We need to find a bank,” Lisa said 
loudly, for the third time.

“No money,” Hassam repeated 
as he showed us photos of himself 
in his shop with Dustin Hoffman, 
Muhammad Ali and other celebrities 
dragged in off the streets over the 
years. “Only Arab hospitality.”

Nevertheless, the price of each bot-
tle was proudly displayed. 

“Rose,” he said, uncapping the 

potent fluid. “Please smell. Only two 
pounds.” 

“Orange. Please smell. Only two 
pounds,” he said, wafting an oil-soaked 
wand under each of our noses.

“Lilac, you 
like lilac?” he 
asked. “Please 
smell. Only two 
pounds.”

The streets 
outside the 
shop crawled 
with people. 
Shopkeepers and 

shoppers, street vendors and beggars, 
touts and tourists, residents — they all 
hustled through the city. The streets 
were lined with cars, honking, swerv-
ing and ignoring traffic signals, with 
the concentrated purpose of avoiding 
any sign of organization.

Lost Baggage 
At midnight, from the Tulip’s bal-

cony, it was clear the bustle would 
continue throughout the night. The 
honking of horns was still persistent 
and the shop’s lights below emitted 
an industrial white glow. The soft yel-
low street lights of the square barely 
illuminated the upper stories of the 
faded yellow buildings — each with 
green window shutters speckling the 
Art Nouveau facade.  

Cars still dipped through the square 
with near-disregard for their surround-
ings, a pattern spreading across the city 
and along Al-Orouba Street, which 
connects the airport to downtown.

Having spent nearly three hours 
filing a lost-baggage claim, I missed my 
airport pickup and had to hitch a ride 

with Farah Stern, a political science 
major at UC Santa Cruz. Her Elvis 
Costello glasses, black fingernails and 
hot-pink toenails made her stand out 
immediately in the airport. Chatting 
nervously over the soft lulling Arabic 
song of our driver, we made our way to 
the Tulip. It was just before 4 p.m. 

“This is my first time abroad,” she 
said, bracing as the driver made his 
own lane to squeeze past slower mov-
ing traffic. “I am the only one here 
from UCSC.”

The grime-covered statue of Talaat 

Harb, prominent lawyer and found-
er of the national bank, now faces 
a rival: the National Bank of Abu 
Dhabi. Directly behind the statue tow-
ers Chark Assurances, where our taxi 
driver left us, pointing east toward the 
Tulip before speeding off. 

Landscapes, Cafes for Radicals
One of the few lights above ground 

level around midnight was the bill-
board above the Chark building. At 
seven stories, Chark Assurances is the 
tallest building in the square. Even 
with a story-high Arabic billboard, the 
rooftops of the Nile Hilton (a white and 

blue modern monstrosity) and several 
other downtown buildings can be seen 
spreading out into the distance. 

A towering clock on the second-
story deck of the Chark building read 
12:17 a.m. as a woman in a bright-
red burka took a seat on a street-side 
bench. Three children with her carried 
pink heart-shaped balloons and played 
in an open sidewalk beneath a small 
tree as cars raced past, horns blaring. 
A block down the street, three men 
pushed a black-and-white taxi around 
the corner of El-Bustan. With the hood 
still up, they gently rolled the cab along 
the sidewalk in front of Cafe Riche. 

The cafe, known to reject tourists 
at the door, is rumored to have hosted 
Abdul Gamal Nasser’s Free Officers 
while they plotted to overthrow King 
Farouk in 1952. The cafe is also known 
to have often served Saddam Hussein 
in his youth, and has remained open 
almost continuously since 1908.

Rebuilt to look authentic, the cafe’s 
polished wooden exterior and lush 
pottery elevates it just a bit too much 
from the run-down grime of the sur-
rounding area.

Two blocks up, Talaat Harb pours 
into Tahrir Square where Kentucky 
Fried Chicken, on the right of the 
street above the Sadat Metro Station, 
is sometimes packed with customers 
as late as 12:45 a.m. KFC’s full-win-
dowed front faces the Mugamma, a 
Soviet gift of the 1960s, which houses 
within its droll exterior the bureau-
cracy of the Interior, Health and 
Education Ministries, as well as the 
Cairo Governate. 

Next door, a fairly new-looking 
cafe hosted a few locals smoking shee-

sha and drinking tea. The fruit-fla-
vored smoke poured out onto the 
sidewalk, mixing with the gray fog of 
burning petrol. 

Known as the Wadi el-Nil, this cafe 
was remodeled in 1993 after being 
bombed by Islamic radicals, apparently 
in reaction to Sudanese cannabis deal-
ers who frequented the establishment. 
The red and white tiles lining the shop 
sparkle. The wooden seats are deco-
rated with carefully-carved helms. 

Just north of the Wadi el-Nil, two 
women in black burkas begged for 
change or food. Despite their spot 
beneath an imposing tree, the Nile 
Hilton was in plain view. At 1:20 a.m. 
in the morning the streets were still 
crowded with shoppers, the cars still 
honked incessantly. 

The Beginning
Twelve hours earlier, at the Cairo 

International Airport I had waited, 
a weary American tourist among a 
crowd of angry and distraught Air 
Italia passengers. Frustrated Arabic 
shouts passed through the crowd. 

“Where can I smoke a cigarette?” 
I asked an airport security guard 
dressed in white. 

“Here,” he said.
“Here?” I questioned.
Standing under a “no smoking” 

sign, I fingered the lit cigarette ner-
vously. Other guards in white passed, 
eyeing me curiously. 

“Don’t be worried,” he laughed in 
heavily-accented English. “You are in 

Arrivals, Departures, Revolutionaries, 
and Smoking in a Non-Smoking Zone

“Don’t be worried,” 
he laughed in 

heavily— accented 
English. “You are in 

Egypt.”

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  17

It’s not every day you get to see parchment older than Jesus. Though now until Dec. 21, you can — at the San Diego Natural History Museum’s Dead Sea 
Scroll exhibit. Widely considered to be some of the 
most important Middle Eastern artifacts ever found, the 
scrolls provide insight into a culture that lived and van-
ished with hardly a trace. The exhibit features two sets 
of scrolls on loan from the Israeli Antiques Authority 
and Department of Antiquities of Jordan; 10 of the 
scrolls are on exhibit for the first time. 

Dating from 250 BCE to 68 CE, the Dead Sea Scrolls 
are some of the oldest known texts from the Hebrew 
Bible.  Because they were in caves near the shore of 
the Dead Sea most historians point to the nearest 
settlement, Qumran, as the most likely origin of the 
scrolls.  The fortress city was probably an enclave of 
orthodox Jewish men who dedicated much of their 
time to diligently copying religious texts. The discovery 
of inkwells (also on exhibit) and a writing room furthers 
the argument that Qumran residents produced these 
texts. Archeologists eventually found 100,000 pieces 
of scrolls, spread across 11 caves, that have now been 
pieced together, forming 900 documents.

Besides the scrolls, the exhibit also displays Israeli 
photography of modern-day Israel, the history of the 
discovery of the scrolls, artifacts from Qumran and a vir-
tual tour through Qumran. The museum does an amaz-
ing job of providing background to how the scrolls 
were most likely created in the context of the scribes’ 
lives. The exhibit goes so far as to address the Scotch 
tape that plagued the restoration of the scrolls. Pulling 
upon patrons’ youthful curiousities, various hands-on 
displays allow museum goers to play archeologist, piec-
ing together smashed vases. Still, other installments let 
visitors feel parchment that might resemble the Dead 
Sea Scrolls in their original form. 

While the exhibit was well planned and meticu-
lously created, politics still impede a truly holistic view. 
The collection fails to address Palestine’s objections, 
despite its thorough attempt to represent the historical 
backdrop. Though the caves are located in Palestine, 
Israel bought many of the scrolls immediately after 
their discovery, and in the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel 
captured a museum where many of the remaining 
scrolls were housed. Israel claimed the scrolls represent 
an important part of Jewish history and therefore has 

not cooperated with Palestine in the return of the 
scrolls — an important part of history ignored in the 
current installation.  

The 12,000-square-foot facility dedicated to the 
exhibit take about three hours to navigate, so make 
sure you have the time and patience to absorb every-
thing. The museum provides free audio guides that 
impart historical background and expert commentary, 
adding to the plethora of signs. To preserve the scrolls, 
the museum rooms are kept at a cool 68 degrees and 
use low lights. Be sure to bring a sweater and a pair of 
reading glasses. Because it is not a traveling exhibit, this 
experience is unique to San Diego. Ten of the scrolls 
change on Oct. 15, so if you want to see both sets, get 
there soon. Tickets cost $20, with a student ID, on week-
days and $24 on weekends.

T hey shouldn’t send heroes to places like Iraq,” says one sol-dier in “Valley of Elah,” another quasi-true story about the wartime experience. But the latest vehicle for Oscar-winning 
director Paul Haggis (“Crash”) moves a cut above the rest, weaving 
together the best thematic shards of the perennial soldier’s tale. 
The product is a heartbreaking understanding of not only soldiers 
in combat, but the bleak life that follows their time in the service.

Haggis, Hollywood’s new golden-boy scribe, picked a curious 
choice as lead; the weathered Tommy Lee Jones doesn’t seem 
enticing at first glance. Consider the preceding pool of actors that 
have taken on similar, albeit shinier, military personas, and Jones’ 
sagging jowls seem even less appealing. 

But Haggis isn’t aiming to sanctify war in the same way 

War Drama Stabs at 
Iraq’s Unseen Flanks

“FIGHT CLUB”
If you’ve yet to see David Fincher’s explosive, machis-
mo-mocking (or praising?) 1999 adaptation of Chuck 

Palahniuk’s philosophical novel about a worn office employee 
(Edward Norton) and his fire-playing friendship with the 
nihilistic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, at his most daring), you’ve 
likely been living under a rock since the century’s turn.  Prepare 
your well-hinged beliefs for a shocking two-hour submission 
— complete with a constant flow of adrenaline as the pair cut 
through social bullshit via self-destruction.

“PEE-WEE’S BIG ADVENTURE”
You might remember bits and pieces of Pee Wee sprin-
kled throughout your elementary years, but have you 

ever taken the time to actually watch Tim Burton’s absurd com-
edy about a man-child in search of his stolen bicycle? We get 
a colorful set of characters dead set on defying their existence 
— and, of course, that classic sax-staple interlude — but most of 
all, “Pee-wee” is the chance to see Paul Reubens at the height of 
his odd creepiness, before he walked into an adult theater and 
got his pee-wee into a big adventure of its own.

Red-Eye to the ’80s
W hy La Jolla Village Cinemas is titling its latest Saturday Midnight Madness festival “Midnight Bradness” is beyond us, but if we know anything about the multi-seasonal staple at La Jolla’s 
indie theater, it’ll still be the best offering of camp and cool outside late-night cable.  Never been?  
Here’s your chance to escape campus life — no car necessary — as well as to see great (or just awe-
somely weird) films on the big screen with a rowdy theater audience.

TOP HONORS

There’s really no better time 
for Southern hip-hop than 
summer  — nothing that 

can push through the slow heat 
like a thumping beat and some strung-
out bars of drawled turf pomp.

And the summer of 2007 could have 
heard no better hip-hop than the fat and 
juicy double disc from Texan vets Bun 
B and Pimp C (the latter fresh out the 
pen), setting a sweltering hypnosis over 
29 tracks that lets standouts like opener 
“Swishas and Dosha” and first single 
“The Game Belongs to Me” steam all 
the hotter.

Here are two time-tailored MCs at 
their absolute ripest: Bun B pours his 
heavy asphalt on the winding, grinding 
“Gravy” (“Still in the hood cause it needs 
me/ And the corner it feeds me/ So I eat 
all I want/ My reputation preceeds me”) 
only to be swept up by Pimp C’s metallic 
refrain, a shimmering hot-road mirage 
(“I’m stayin true/ I’m out here reppin’ 
my Mercedes/ Fuckin’ with the midnight 
ladies/ The game is cold but it’s gravy”).

UGK have long laid low, quietly 
observing their region’s rise to the spot-
light, slipping cameos and solos into 
the mix when it felt right. But with 
Underground Kingz, their ticking time 
bomb explodes into a sea of synth that 
redefines the treasured folk music of the 
South — which, as much as we West 
Coasters would like to fight it, holds a 
heaping portion of our nation’s heat.

Ladies, call him Curtis. After a speedbump of 
songs devoted to securing his status as NYC street-stalker 

extraordinaire, 50 turns his fourth studio album into one long, 
dirty pick-up line — and he ain’t bothering with no foreplay. “You 
ain’t gotta take your panties off, just pull ’em to the side,” he beckons 
on “Candy Shop”-sequel “Amusement Park,” for which I’m sure you 
can guess the sweeping metaphor. Hint: the lollipop/magic stick has 
turned rollercoaster/horsey on the carousel.

Before any fellow garage-rap exports had filled 
in the gray areas, Dizzee’s electrocuted zig-zag once 

embodied for us the East London locale. But as his fanbase 
continues to shift further stateside — while Kano’s introverted London 
Town rises and falls like the spattering of raindrops on musty London 

cobblestone — this young prodigy scrubs his grime and 
mutes his sharp rapid-fire, even recruiting UGK to speed 
up the assimilation process. Still, hold on tight.

Talib lingers at dangeous levels on the hype-meter: 
He’s long been dubbed the best rapper still in the minors. 

Worse, the backpacker himself seems to take it deeper to heart with 
every album; Ear Drum, despite squeezing contributions from every 
one of many fans in high places (Kanye, KRS-One, Pete Rock, Just 

Blaze, even Justin Timberlake), spends its entirety harking 
the heavens, never grounding to reveal the man we talk so 
much about but never quite get to know.

Theirs is a subtle union: Exile’s production (usu-
ally aid to modern soulster Aloe Blacc, together as 

Emanon) is simple, almost forgettable, but in the best way possible 
— every sparse drumbeat and enlivening loop is instantly absorbed by 
the expertly timed journal-scribble of common-man Blu. “Tryin’ to hit 

reset, knee deep in debt/ Tryin’ to figure how to feed a mouth 
that ain’t got teeth yet,” he raps of baby-mama drama on 
track 10, hitting every earnest handclap.

Sometimes it’s hard not to wonder — as Sri Lankan 
dance princess M.I.A. claws, squawks, bubbles and 

Bjorkian battle-cries her way through a jungle of Stomp-worthy 
campfire instruments, hybrid Rastafarian/British/Indian accent flying 
every which way — if perhaps she just likes to listen to herself make 

weird noises. Like any normal 5-year-old. With unpredict-
able, firecracker politics and quick assumptions that the 
world is pitted against her.  Except Timbaland, of course.

Here’s Shug’s story: Mean ugly brute from the 
wrong side of Boston runs into jazzy youngster-around-

town Guru, teaches him the art of rhyme, and the two form Gang 
Starr. But while Shug serves some time, Guru runs off to score fame 
with DJ Premier, his partner still buried in the underground. The bad 

boy gets revenge on sophomore fury Street Champ, knocking 
around Premo’s (and imitator Moss’) tap-tap orchestration 
like the rest of the collective could only dream of.

The most distinct of the Wu-Tang coattailers, 
Killah Priest stays stubbornly true to their collective 

mantra — spitting throaty sermons with afrocentric, 5-percent 
fervor — while still popping the ’90s-stuck Wu bubble and fighting his 
own lyrical battles. The junior Killah sails through lessons in astrology, 

geography and ghetto history to a tangled church commo-
tion of chants and organs, plucking dead-serious spots from 
a godlike Nas and the hell-raising Immortal Technique.

We are all slaves to Kanye’s samples. They’re 
expertly wedged, melodic and empowering, and they’ll play 

on endless head-loop until he throws some more our way. Thing is, 
Kanye’s also a slave to his samples. They’re the flashy clothes that wear 
him, trailed by childlike rhymes panting to catch up — charmingly 
innocent, each syllable stressed in cross-eyed concentration, always 
emulating a certain Jay character. “Big Brother” apparently brings out 
the best in his little sib, though, as the star of a shining tribute track.

20 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007

S
ão Paulo is at war. It’s a beautiful city, 
with endless high rises and booming 
industry, but overpopulation is at 
critical mass and the divide between 
rich and poor is at its breaking 

point. With director Jason Kohn’s award-win-
ning documentary debut, “Manda Bala” (or 
“Send a Bullet”), American audiences will see a 
stunningly different side of Brazil. 

In his effort to expose the tug-of-war 
between economic classes, Kohn combines 
Hollywood’s stylized blockbuster techniques 
with hard-hitting interviews that shatter all 
expectations, delving deep into the fascinat-
ing and seldom-explored shadows of a South 

American city where rich and poor routinely 
feed off of each other. Politicians steal from 
the penniless, who in turn resort to kidnap-
ping members of the elite for ransom, while a 
thriving industry of entrepreneurs march to 
the front lines in search of profits. Kohn weaves 
compelling images with pointed commentary 
to bring an overwhelmingly complex issue into 
focus: Interviews include a kidnap victim and a 
kidnapper, a politician and a plastic surgeon, a 
cop and a car dealer.

But the film all begins with 
a frog farmer. 

By way of the green, wet and 
slimy, Kohn links the highest 

echelon of crime in Brazil — political scandal — 
by following its reverberations to the very bottom, 
to the people who are most effected. Though the 
frogs are so densely crowded in shallow reservoirs 
at the farm that they leap and clamor over each 
other by the thousands, the farmer who’s spent 
his life raising them — a big man with a bigger 
grin — still drops his smile mid-interview at the 
mention of possible scandal.

Brazilian Congressman Jader Barbalho, who 
has used the farms to launder over $2 bil-

lion in stolen money, built 
the amphibious farm, along 
with hundreds of others. 
The farmer refuses to speak 

of the scandal, expressing fear of reprisal for 
even admitting there ever was one. Meanwhile, 
Kohn’s camera rotates the breadth of the city, 
revealing crumbling sky-high apartments and 
vast stretches of shantytowns. Over half the 
city’s population lives in squalor, packed into 
slums and increasingly turning to crime while 
its elected representatives reap billions.

Kohn uses uses the farmer’s interview — 
along with recurring footage of swimming tad-
poles that evolved into deep fried entrees — as 
a powerful visual metaphor for the film’s narra-
tive. It’s about the never-ending cycles of wealth

Not your routine Saturday morning schlock, 
this animation showcase — in its second year 
— fuses the stylistic edge and experimental 
animation that you’d normally catch at one of 
our nation’s countless politically correct film 
festivals. Diverse in theme and eclectic in 
approach, each animator will present their short 

feature, among them Stacey Steers, Martha 
Colburn, Will Kim, Brent Green and Kohl Glass. 
A warning: You’re not going to be reunited with 
that infamous carrot-chomping rabbit, one-
upping a saliva-fountain duck. In fact, much 
better — the films feature adult content without 
rating. (CM)

“Eastern Promises”        
LA JOLLA VILLAGE / NOW PLAYING

When an actor wants to flee the bonds of 
blockbuster franchise typecasting, he typically 
lets it all hang out for a respected auteur in an 
emotionally taut narrative. And hey, if Harry 
Potter’s Daniel Radcliffe could do it on stage, 
why not Viggo Mortensen — who, to many, still 
embodies Tolkien’s chainmail warrior Aragorn. 
Fact is, he’s one of the finest character actors of 

his generation, reteaming with Canuck “History 
of Violence” mastermind David Cronenberg for 
a sinister spiral into the world of the Russian 
mob in the UK, where a tattoed Mortensen must 
steer midwife Naomi Watts through underworld 
treachery. Best moment: Mortensen kicks the 
shit out of a fleet of hired goons, set against 
greasy tiled walls in a Russian bathhouse. (CM)

how to spend week one
If you can manage to tear yourself from a 

syllabus-packed week of preproduction — and I’d 
recommend it, considering every week after will bury 
you deeper and deeper in work you won’t actually 
do, but will still keep you from guilt-free concert-
hopping — indulge in a rare set of gems lighting 
up the last of San Diego’s summer nights.

Day one of classes poses the toughest choice: 
indie dance party at Canes or Epicentre? Pensive 

enlightenment at HOB or the Casbah? Rough.  
The weekend gets even crazier, with a street fair 
that hosts more than 70 local feel-gooders (like 
the Bill Magee Blues Band, to bring out your 
mother’s moves in you) over eight gritty blocks 
in the “bad” part of town, alongside deliciously 
sketchy carnival rides and plenty of drunk-
munchie booths to take care of all the money the 
music isn’t costing you. (SW)

ou’d imagine an idea like 
this would have popped 
up on Broadway first: A 

Liverpool factory boy expatriates 
himself to America, winding up 
in a love affair with a girl-next-
door turned radical hippie, told in 
a 1960s epic. Add musical interpre-
tations of the world’s most beloved 
rock band and you’ve got a surefire 
winner on your hands, right?  

Yes and no. “Frida” director 
Julie Taymor’s excursion into the 

decade of the Beatles quickly flies 
between pools of sorrow and a few 
waves of joy, propelled wayward by 
a desire to do far too many things 
far too often.

The boy-meets-girl stock plot 
follows a very McCartney-looking 
Jude (Jim Sturgess) — the afore-
mentioned Brit — who, by means 
of Maxwell (Joe Anderson), lands 
in New York during the turbu-
lent social unrest of the ’60s, sur-
rounded by Vietnam, psychedelics 
and rock ’n’ roll revolution. His 
journey links with coming-out 
Prudence (TV Carpio), Hendrix-

lite JoJo (Martin Luther), mater-
nal vixen Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and 
Max’s kid sister Lucy (Evan Rachel 
Wood), the last exuding enough 
wily wholesomeness for Jude to 
entirely forget his muted-existence 
lady friend across the pond. In the 
film’s best sequence, Jude descends 
into the statutory crush to the tune 
of “I’ve Just Seen a Face” in a bowl-
ing alley, fellow bowlers gliding and 
careening down the lanes under 
alley lights that flicker between 
stark reality and a rainbow of emo-
tional silhouettes. It’s exhilarat-
ing and moving, the only point at

and corruption, poverty and crime. 
Underfed frogs turn to cannibalism 
just as humans turn on one another 
when their quality of life is depleted. 
Aside from desperate turns to serious 
crimes like carjacking and bank rob-
bing, the fastest-growing offense in 
Brazil is kidnapping, which occurs as 
frequently as once a day in the met-
ropolitan area. 

Kidnappers cut off body parts, 
mailing them to family members as 
incentive for hefty ransoms. The most 
common is the ear: Kohn interviews 
a victim who had both of her ears 
dismembered before she was freed. 
We then hear from Juarez Avelar, a 
pioneer of ear reconstruction surgery, 
who the kidnapped woman quickly 
turned to after her release. At first 
the doctor seems like a hero — then 
Kohn shows us footage of the doc-
tor’s home, an extravagant mansion 
set within the manicured acres of 
his estate; yet another entrepreneur 
profiting from desperate times, one 
car salesman who specializes in bul-
letproofing automobiles as a kidnap-
ping deterrant collects $415,000 a 
job. Their luxurious lives are visually  
juxtaposed in next frame to naked 
children playing in a street coated 
with trash and sewage. 

At first, we see every character in 
a focused light: the corrupt politician 
painted with Nazi hues, the amoral 
kidnapper who doesn’t give murder a 
second thought, the entrepreneurial 
car salesman making a killing by bul-
let-proofing cars, the innovative pro-
fessional who revolutionized recon-
structive surgery — all play clear roles 
in Brazil’s criminal climate. The film 
seems like a failed attempt to provide 
coverage of the scandal, as though the 
filmmakers came up shy and resorted 
to the juiciest footage.

But Kohn’s efforts begin to fuzz 
our preconceptions. The kidnapper 
is a community leader in his slum, 
redistributing wealth like a present-
day Robin Hood. The car salesman 
laughs at the paranoia of his clients 
and then admits he’s bullet-proofed 
all four of his cars. He and the other 
affluent citizens of São Paulo avoid 
the streets whenever possible, put-
ting Brazil on the map for the world’s 
largest fleet of privately-owned heli-
copters. By the documentary’s finish, 
it has wrapped a brilliant and com-
plex expose of class conflicts: a swift-
handed curtain-rip to reveal corrup-
tion in all its forms, and a sincere 
observation of the worst symptoms 
of poverty.

Landmark’s Kiddie Flicks Light Up Past Your Bedtime

“THE LABYRINTH”
Yeah, yeah, Jennifer Connelly’s in it, but who could out-
shine Ziggy Stardust? David Bowie steals the show as 

the Goblin King Jareth, who pits the 15-year-old Connelly against 
a massive labyrinth in order to save her baby brother. Not weird 
enough for you? Muppet creator Jim Henson directed this fantasy-
adventure-musical, which means a never-ending supply of schizo-
phrenic, stuffed talking things.

“THE KARATE KID”
Director John Avildsen must have had a thing for under-
dogs: Nearly a decade before the grasshopper entered the 

dojo, Avildsen followed a certain “Italian Stallion” into the boxing 
ring with Best Picture “Rocky.” Turn down the target age, switch the 
horn fanfare to ’80s synth and blast Zen Buddhism, and you’ve got 
yourself another fist-pumping crowd-pleaser. Sure, the end is cool, 
but we know that half the fun is watching Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) 
train Danny (Ralph Macchio) — in glorious montage — for the 
final spar with Cobra Kai.

“GREMLINS”
Keep them from bright light, water and food after 
midnight. Apply these to UCSD students — er, mogwai 

(sounds like a good name for an indie band), the star furballs 
in a creature feature that’s half Furbie freak show and half sub-
versive stab at pop-culture wholesomeness. One of the seminal 
’80s films in the early days of marketing Santa-season tie-ins, 
“Gremlins” is, at most, a chance to relive that first toddler 
inkling of filmic fear.

“SPACEBALLS”
While legions of uber-geeks memorized Monty Python 
one-liners, the inner nerd of the mass public engaged with 

Mel Brooks’ genre spoofs — first “Blazing Saddles,” then his thumb 
(or finger) at George Lucas, “Spaceballs.” Loaded with every pun, 
jab, mock, play-on-words and sexual innuendo you could expect 
from the comedian who modernized cinematic shtick, “Spaceballs” 
is an entertaining throw-away: a laugh-for-a-minute, forget-for-a-
year flick that holds up, if not for anything else, due to its dead-on 
roast of movie merchandising.

“THE PRINCESS BRIDE”
While it’s debatable whether the aforementioned ’80s 
films are classics, Rob Reiner’s take on fairytales of yore 

stands the test of time not only as a great send-up, but also, oddly 
enough, as the most original swashbuckling yarn since Disney 
stopped churning them out in the ’50s. Robin Wright (pre-Penn) 
and Carey Elwes (pre-girth widening) play star-crossed lovers 
Buttercup and Wesley, trying to live happily ever after in the face 
of so-evil-they’re-pathetic Prince Humperdinck and his cronies. 
It’s a prime collection of the trashy decade’s humor obscurity, 
with costars like Kevin Arnold, Columbo, that guy who hosts the 
Oscars a lot, Nigel Tufnel (“Spinal Tap”) and, of course, the very 
vengeful Inigo Montoya.

“A CHRISTMAS STORY”
Targeted at those yearning for the good old days, this tale 
of childhood innocence clashing with an increasingly com-

mercial holiday ended up echoing with kids the country over. From 
yellow-eyed bullies to the double-dog dare, the diary of Ralphie 
Parker’s quest to get that 1940 Red Ryder Carbine Action Two-
Hundred Shot Range Model Air Rifle chronicles every kid’s struggle 
to negotiate with fickle adults, a steady stream of fads and the search 
for meaning in materialism. Just in time for the holiday rush, “A 
Christmas Story” knows that beautiful red rifle will eventually collect 
dust in the attic — but not before Parker shoots his eye out.

which the film reaches that soul-lifting 
peak we yearn to hit in musicals.

From there we get radio-staple ren-
ditions like “With a Little Help From 
My Friends,” “Something,” “All You 
Need Is Love” and other timeless melo-
dies spun to death on oldies stations 
— songs that satisfy for a few measures 
before we skip to the next track or 
change the station (we know them by 
heart, so what’s the use?). Where is 
“For No One,” “Two of Us,” “Honey 
Pie”? If the tracks aren’t arbitrarily 
used, they’re being slaughtered. Take, 
for example, Lennon’s Hindu chant 
from “Across the Universe,” written 
to pay homage to his Indian guru, 
offensively tacked on to the lips of 
oft-mocked Hare Krishnas, apparently 
because Taymor needed to fit the lyric 
in somewhere. And by the time we get 
to the “na-na-na” refrain of “Hey Jude,” 
we miss the epic buildup it’s supposed 
to set, the sound of the world giving 
Jude his epiphany. Instead we’re thrown 
a handful of banal dockworkers.

Unfortunately for the songs that do 
work, Taymor miscalculates or over-
indulges most accompanying images. 
Prudence’s melancholy take of “I Wanna 
Hold Your Hand” could work, sweet 
and lonely, if not for her waltz through 
a defensive play by the high school foot-
ball team. Max gets drafted to a visually 
stunning take on the Abbey Road gem 
“I Want You (She’s So Heavy),” and for a 
while we’re captivated by the militariza-
tion of youth, kids being sent off to the 
17th parallel — until the shot of recruits 
carrying a Statue of Liberty across a 

dwarfed war set, complete with cheesy 
computer-generated helicopters to, you 
know, capture the imperialistic clamor 
of the Vietnam War. British cover-art-
ist Joe Cocker offers the best fab-four 
interpretation with his gritty, soul-
pumping “Come Together,” marred by 
an unnecessary Fred Astaire skip from 
a mass of men in suits. 

Taymor’s visual feast can be sweep-
ing and majestic and trippy, like during 
the LSD-exploratory “I Am the Walrus” 
by Ken Kesey-wannabe Roberts (Bono 
doing his best Robin Williams) or the 
Monty Python-esque “Being for the 
Benefit of Mr. Kite.” But it often fails 
to gel with the music, contrasting so 
grossly that a comedic void opens, 
sucking that mystical veil of innocence 
that carries musical theater.

If this all sounds bitter, maybe it’s 
because it comes from a self-described 
Beatles purist; who has annoying-
ly put to memory everything from 
Paul’s count-off on “Please Please Me” 
to John’s last studio jest on “Let It 
Be” and every note in between; who 
believes that finding a story in the 
music of the Beatles should be drawn 
from the music of the Beatles, not by 
cherry-picking every top-chart ditty 
and throwing it haphazardly into a 
detached universe. Taymor is known 
for her unique conceptual designs 
(she directed the mind-bending “Lion 
King” Broadway musical), but here 
her vision is too lofty: She wants an 
overview of both music and history 
with psychological depth, loaded with 
fun characters and music we all love. 
Eventually, something’s gotta give.

that Denzel Washington’s natural 
grace added prettier, nobler sides 
to “Courage Under Fire.” Instead, 
Haggis attacks war through the 
entry-level angles: it’s the soldier’s 
experience that is usually the dirti-
est. 

If Haggis’ everyman approach is 
meant to highlight a grander theme, 
he succeeds — in oozing, deliber-
ate fashion. The film’s hardened 
characters seem accustomed to war 
being eternally unforgiving; “Elah” 
bears just as heavily on its veterans 
as today’s government. With this in 
mind, Haggis wrenches our un-battle-
tested guts a little harder — soldiers 
learn to stomach the furthest, darkest 
reaches of humanity, ones that leave 
the typical filmgoer aghast.

Haggis’ war is an apparitional 
monster, fouling every scrap of life 
it touches and reaching past every 
limit of time and space. The camera 
never even sets foot in Iraq — we 
only get glimpses of the war through 
stunted flashbacks and almost incom-
prehensible video, transmitted in 
piecemeal through a cell phone cam. 
Some scenes buzz with ambient CNN 
noise, President George W. Bush’s 
voice trumpeting the now-ironic calls 
of sure victory.

“Elah” follows Hank Deerfield, 

a military father searching a small 
town for Mike Deerfield, one of his 
army brats gone AWOL. Mike’s grue-
some murder — and the ensuing mil-
itary cover-ups and hush-ups — spur 
Jones’ super-cop into a self-motivated 
investigation of the crime. 

Jones gives the film a heartbreak-
ing, defeated paternalism, driving the 
piercing tragedy of father-burying-
son even deeper. In Hank, Haggis 
has reignited his penchant for the 
wearied character model; the last 
for whom we felt that off-center love 
was Clint Eastwood in the Haggis-
penned “Million Dollar Baby.” But 
unlike in “Baby,” Jones carries the 
load of scenes and dialogue, giving 
less warm jawing between charac-
ters. Hilary Swank and Eastwood 
formed the underdog pair of the 
year, full of a leathery tenderness 
that made its finale overwhelm-
ingly heart-wrenching, but satisfy-
ingly poignant. In “Elah,” there is no 
warmth, only a void filled with regret 
and mourning.

That dark place is familiar to much 
of the film’s meaty cast that shines in 
almost all angles: Jason Patric man-
ages to face-off with both the frosty 
Jones and a quick-lipped Charlize 
Theron, playing a pushy small-town 
cop. Josh Brolin adds more color as 
the town’s police brass. But the heavy 

lifting comes from Jones and Susan 
Sarandon, playing Hank’s curt wife 
Joan. 

The prospect of wartime death 
and torment doesn’t faze the Deerfield 
family — Hank himself has all the 
edgy trappings we’d expect in a hard-
edged veteran. Joan’s banter with her 
husband is stunted; their conversa-
tions sway between dull and indif-
ferent, but Sarandon commands her 
role. She properly plays Jones’ better 
-half, just as rugged and worn down 
by life, but with a woman’s softness 
in motive.

To pull the oft-closeted emotions 
(rage, vengeance, etc.) from his hard-
ened characters, Haggis lobs them 
dismemberment, corpse-torching, 
torture and the like, then asks the 
vital question: What impact does war 
really have on the soul? Haggis drags 
us kicking and screaming into black, 
psychologically decaying holes we’d 
never dare visit.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  33

LeVieux paced the men, taking the 
22nd spot with a very respectable 
time of 25:33 on the eight-kilome-
ter men’s route. For a team still in 
the early part of its season, such 
finishes against high caliber com-
petition serve to motivate the team 
and give it confidence to win its own 
conference.

“It feels good to get a taste of some 
of the faster teams,” senior captain 
Ryan Becijos said. “Some of the teams 
in our conference are just as competi-
tive but overall it’s a good experience 
for the team.”

The third meet of the year was 
hopefully the most foretelling. The 
Tritons traveled on Sept. 15 to the 
Southern Stampede, hosted by 
Missouri Southern State University 
— the future site of the 2007 
Division-II Cross Country National 
Championships, which will be held 
in mid-November. In Missouri, the 
women placed third out of 37 teams 
with the men taking 11th. Once again 
Dunn led the Tritons, finishing in 
17:49, good for ninth overall. Junior 
Kevin Klein’s time of 25:36 earned 
him the 36th place finish on the 
day. Experience on the terrain where 
nationals will soon be held gives the 
Tritons a definite leg up on the com-
petition.

“The meet was really exciting 
because all the guys ran fast times,” 
Becijos said. “It gets everyone excit-
ed to travel there later because we 
already know that we can run well 
there.”

This season the men’s team will 
be a balance of experience and youth. 
After only graduating one senior 
from the 2006 squad, the men might 
look for leadership from sophomore 
Max Mullender, who was named 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Freshman of the Year 
for 2006. Joining Mullender in the 
youth department is fellow sopho-
more Jessie Morrill, who last year was 
named to the NCAA D-II All-West 
Region team. These young Tritons 
can look forward to building on these 
early successes for years to come. 

Just like their male counterparts, 
the women lost only one senior to 
graduation from last year’s team, leav-
ing the 2007 Tritons stocked full of 
valuable experienced players. Dunn 
will be looking to duplicate her 2006 
NCAA D-II All-West Region acco-
lade while helping her team continue 
its pattern of national championship 
appearances.

“As a team we are looking to place 
at the conference championships and 
improve upon last year’s finish at 
regionals,” Dunn said. “Personally I’m 
hoping to move up in championship 
races and to place at nationals.”

Garcia’s new coaching style and 
battle-tested experience up and down 
the Triton roster might just be the 
perfect combination to lead the 2007 
Tritons to Missouri for the national 
championships.

from a 1-6-1 season, there is still 
plenty of optimism on the squad as it 
looks toward the future. 

“Many of these players will be 
playing four years for me now,” 
Armstrong said. “Brandon Yee has 
been impressive as a freshman as 
the starting left fullback, and the 
goalkeepers have done well. I can’t 
blame them at all. Jason Le will be 
a big boost as he comes back from 
injury and Chris Chin, another 
freshman, was injured in the pre-
season with a bad ankle. We have 
been depleted by injuries a little bit 
thus far.”

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  35

tastic saves late in the game to seal 
the victory. 

A similar formula of timely 
goal scoring and stingy defense 
was employed over the subsequent 
games, leading to three more con-
ference wins. In those three games 
the Tritons scored eight goals while 
allowing only one. 

The only possible blemish of the 
young season would be a 0-0 tie 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The Tritons battled the Toros through 
a tense 90 minutes of regulation but 
were unable to get the game-winning 
goal across, missing on all six shots 
before overtime. A pair of overtime 
periods yielded nothing more than 
great defense and close calls for the 
Tritons, who were still able to main-
tain their first place position in the 
CCAA South Division with a leading 
13 points. 

The Tritons realize that they can-
not take any game for granted and 
must not let their great start trick 
them into a false sense of security. 
The gapping goal differential indi-
cates pure supremacy, but the stat 
is more indicative of their first-half 
play than anything else. UCSD has 
been fantastic at scoring early in all 
of its games but has been unable to 
continue that trend in the final half. 
The 8-0-1 record is another testa-
ment to the stoppers on defense, but 

for the Tritons to reclaim the national 
championship the team has chased 
for the last five seasons, they must be 
able to distance themselves from their 
opponents by putting the game out of 
reach in the second half. 

Sophomore midfielder Alexia 
Zatarain recognized the tendency 
toward better first-half play, put 
points out that the Tritons have 

already started to make the necessary 
adjustments. 

“We have been struggling in the 
second half,” Zatarain said. “Maybe 
it’s because we scored so much in the 
first that we came out a little slower 
later on. In the Dominguez game our 
second half was a million times better 
than our first, and our coaches were 
really happy with our play.”

The abundance of goals being 

scored by the Tritons seems almost 
unnecessary with the unrelenting 
effort that the keeper McGovern is 
putting forth. She has played every 
minute of every game while saving 
20 shots and posting a goals-against 
average of a mere 0.36 on the season. 

While the national poll did not 
consider UCSD worthy of the top 
ranking, the coaches within the 
CCAA predicted the Tritons to finish 
first in conference in the preseason 
coaches’ poll. The respect shown by 
the opposing coaches reflects just 
how much UCSD has dominated its 
own conference in recent years. 

Last year’s CCAA Championship 
was the team’s sixth overall and all 
signs point to the 2007 team add-
ing a seventh. Although the 2006 
team compiled an outstanding 20-2-
2 record (13-2-1 CCAA) and made 
a national quarterfinal appearance, 
this year’s team returns with 15 let-
ter winners and six starters, includ-
ing All-CCAA senior midfielder 
Caitlin Ryan, senior forward Kathy 
Sepulveda and junior midfielder 
Amanda Esquivel. 

Although the Tritons’ dominance 
over their conference rivals has not 
created many heated rivalries, the 
matches against Cal Poly Pomona 
and Cal State San Bernardino always 
provide a challenge. 

“Every game is really impor-
tant in conference, but the Pomona 

and San Bernardino games always 
are exciting” Belak-Berger said. “It 
seems like all the other teams always 
try and bring their ‘A’ game when 
they play us.”

Entering his 21st year of coach-
ing at UCSD, McManus is the para-
gon of consistency. McManus, who 
arrived in La Jolla in 1986 as an 
assistant coach, has become one 
of the most successful and well-
respected coaches in all of collegiate 
soccer. 

“Playing for coach McManus is 
really great,” Zatarain said. “He’s 

won so many national champion-
ships it really motivates us to want 
to win for him. He’s great at pushing 
us and making us want to win.”

His career winning percentage 
is the third best in NCAA women’s 
soccer history and he recently won 
his 350th game with a shutout vic-
tory over San Francisco State. After 
dominating D-III soccer, McManus’ 
team moved up a division in 2000 
and, under his guidance, immedi-
ately cemented UCSD’s place among 
the nation’s best by winning back-
to-back national championships.

als,” Bailey said. “This team has the 
talent, ability and work ethic. We 
got off to a slow start and now it’s 
about believing.”

At 9-5 overall and 3-3 in confer-
ence, the team is just now fulfilling 
its potential. The team is focus-
ing on improving its transition and 
swing game.

“The problem is being 
addressed,” Black said. “We’re 
working very hard to get quicker 
in our game and the results have 
shown in games where we do it 
well.”

The Tritons opened up their 
season playing 11 of their first 12 
away from home. UCSD started the 
long road trip in San Bernardino 
going 2-2 at the Coyote Classic 
with both losses coming in five 
games against ranked opponents. 
The Tritons regrouped in Hawaii, 
going 4-0 without dropping a single 
set. The team then stretched its 
winning streak to six before being 
downed by Cal State Los Angeles in 
UCSD’s home opener.

Returning home for only the 
second time this season, the No. 21 
Tritons faced a pair of fellow CCAA 
competitors in No. 2 Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona. 

A scrappy Coyote team from 
San Bernardino was too much for 
the Tritons in front of a raucous 
home crowd as UCSD went down 
16-30, 22-30, 28-30. Junior outside 
hitter Bailey tallied 11 kills to lead 
the Tritons and senior outside hit-
ter Casey Wilson added nine.  

The team rebounded Sept. 22 
as UCSD outmatched an outstand-
ing Cal Poly Pomona team, 30-24, 
30-17, 30-28, avenging the disap-
pointing loss the night before. The 
Tritons were quicker, hit harder 
and served better than a Bronco 
team that came into the match with 
only two losses. 

“[The Cal State San Bernardino 
game] was the first game against a 
tough team that we didn’t lose our 
composure,” Black said. “We gained 

a lot of confidence and tonight was 
the first time we’ve seen the play on 
the court the same as in practice.”

Now that the Tritons seem to 
have everything working on the 
court, they will look to maintain 
their momentum with some more 
wins. 

The Tritons’ next chance will 
come when they face CCAA oppo-
nent Humboldt State. First serve is 
set for 7 p.m. on Sept. 29 at RIMAC 
Arena.

San Diego Has Much to Offer Sports Fans
To all the incoming freshman sports fans that are depressed to be entering a school with-
out a football team or a Triton squad 
that belongs to Division I: I am here 
to inform you that San Diego is not 
a bad place to spend your next four 
years — or more — if you’re an avid 
sports fan.

To start, UCSD is the proud 
host of a constantly overachieving 
women’s soccer team, a men’s water 
polo team that squares off against 
D-I opponents like UCLA and a 
women’s volleyball team that started 
the season with a No. 4 ranking.

But if you’re too much of a sports 
elitist to join the Triton Tide, choos-
ing instead to religiously follow the 
University of Southern California 
football team because it is in the 
national spotlight, then at least be 
thankful that you reside in the city 
of San Diego, a hotspot for profes-
sional sports and extreme sports 
alike.

Besides the Padres, poised to 
make a run at their second straight 
National League 
West title, and 
the Chargers, a 
perennial playoff 
contender with 
the no-doubt 
star of the NFL 
in LaDainian 
Tomlinson, San 
Diego plays host 
to many of the most exciting events 
in the sporting world.

One such event took place over 
the weekend, and as the sports edi-
tor of the Guardian, I worked my 
way into an invitation to the Red 
Bull Air Race World Series 2007. To 
those who didn’t catch the commer-
cials that aired every minute, it is an 
event held in the San Diego harbor 
that combines “flying with the most 
exciting elements of motor racing,” 
according to the media guide. This 
means pilots in propelled planes fly-
ing upwards of 250 miles per hour 
and forces pushing 10 times the 
force of gravity.

As a spectator among the thou-
sands of San Diegans that were also 
welcome to view the race — for a 
price, though — I witnessed these 
pilots maneuver their planes just 
50 feet above the water through a 
course that had them doing ridicu-

lous tricks and turns. The event had 
the intensity of any competitive time-
oriented event, with pilots turning 
in times that were just hundredths 
of a second ahead of or behind 
their opponents’ times. But unlike 

any old NASCAR 
race, this event 
offered the thrill 
of high-speed 
flying, all set in 
front of the beau-
tiful backdrop of 
the harbor, the 
Coronado Bridge 
and the rest of the 

San Diego sights.
The Red Bull Air Race is just 

the latest event to stop by “America’s 
Finest City.” Just two years ago, San 
Diego’s PETCO Park played host 
to the final rounds of the inaugural 
World Baseball Classic. Once again 
I was present — this time by paid 
ticket, not press pass — when the 
Japanese team, led by Ichiro and pre-
Red Sox “Dice-K” Matsuzaka, sur-
prised the world by blowing past the 
stocked American and Dominican 
teams.

The itinerary for prestigious 
San Diego sporting events is likely 
to stay packed in the near future. 
PETCO Park is one of the most lux-
urious new ballparks in the nation 
and should therefore host the MLB 
All-Star game soon enough. And 
with all the surfing and skating fans 
in the area, an X-Games San Diego 
isn’t a far cry from reality. 

Who knows what’s in store for 
San Diego sports fans? A month from 
now, San Diego could be hosting a 
World Series game and in January, 
an American Football Conference 
Championship game in San Diego 
would be better for players and fans 
than one in frigid New England.

So, fret not you fresh-faced San 
Diegans. I urge you to give the 
UCSD teams a chance — trust me, 
you will not be disappointed. But 
if D-II college teams don’t do it for 
you, you can find plenty of occa-
sions to paint your chest, lose your 
voice and cry your heart out in the 
local sports scene.

following that game up with wins 
over UC Santa Cruz and University of 
the Pacific. UCSD ended the tourna-
ment with a 13-7 loss to UC Davis. 

“Despite going 2-2, we played bet-
ter water polo,” Harper said. “We 
had a very good game against Long 
Beach State. It was the best game for 
our team defense. The Pacific game 
was our best game yet. We were a 
little out of gas for our last game and 
weren’t able to deal with the number 
one ranked team in our conference, 
UC Davis.” 

The Tritons are looking for one of 
their young players to have a break-
out season, but so far that has not 
happened.

“We’re playing okay and that’s 
with no one really breaking out. We 
remain hopeful that it’s going to hap-
pen,” Harper said.

Sophomore two-meter Daniel 
Garcia is still more than hopeful 
about the prospect of seeing a break-
out year from some players. 

“I expect a really strong finish 
to the season, getting a lot better as 
a team,” Garcia said. “There will be 
some surprises along the way.”

UCSD is ready for more competi-
tion in its home game against Loyola 
Marymount University on Sept. 27.  

“We almost always have great 
games against each other,” Garcia 
said. “They are going through some 
changes like we are right now.”  

Garcia is confident in the Tritons’ 
chances of winning against Loyola 
Marymount University.

“We know each other and have 
a rivalry,” Garcia said. “We expect a 
close game but we have better players 
and a better coach so we should pull 
the win out.”

After being shutout for four 
straight games, the UCSD men’s soc-
cer team managed to score two goals, 
but still fell short as the Tritons lost 
2-3 to the Cal State San Marcos 
Cougars on Sept. 21. The Tritons 
then lost a thrilling double over-
time contest 2-1 against Cal State 
Los Angeles on Sept. 23. The game 
dropped the team’s overall record to 
1-6-1 in the young season.

Head coach Derek Armstrong 
believes that his team’s early struggles 
are a result of lack of experience, with 
15 freshmen and sophomores on the 
squad, rather than lack of effort. 

“It’s not lack of effort but the 
naivete of young freshmen,” said 
Armstrong. “The past losses have 
been mainly due to personal mis-
takes. There has been nothing wrong 
with the team or our tactics. Just dif-
ferent people making mistakes and 
that’s really disappointing.”

Junior goalkeeper Peter Akman 
voiced the same concerns.

“The team is very talented and 
has great potential but we are battling 
with the problems that come with 
having such a young team,” Akman 
said. “We have not lost a game this 
season in which a team has been 
better than us — we have lost due to 
silly mistakes.”

On Sept. 21, the Tritons finished 
off a strong first half as junior mid-
fielder Jason Le, a transfer from 
Vanderbilt University returning after 
recovering from a separated shoul-
der, scored the equalizer in the wan-
ing minutes of the first half to bring 
the score to 1-1 going into halftime. 
The team started the second half with 
momentum, taking the lead with Le’s 
penalty kick. 

The lead was short-lived, though, 
as the Cougars stole the ball six min-
utes later to score on a breakaway 

and tie the game at two apiece. The 
Tritons gave up the third goal with 20 
minutes left in the half and valiantly 
tried to tie the score. However, a 
number of miscues, errant passes and 
mistimed headers foiled the Triton 
attack. The Cougars keeper, who had 
five saves in the second half alone, 
stopped any real scoring threats. 

Armstrong again voiced his frus-
trations over the team’s inexperience 
and its lack of leadership. 

“Honestly, the spunk and spirit of 
the team is wonderful but the naive-
ty is the problem,” Armstrong said. 
“Under pressure, we get too many 
errors and it’s part of being a young 
team taking its lumps. But they will 
turn around and hopefully before the 
end of this season.”

Akman added that the older play-
ers on the team have to step up and 
set good examples for the younger 
players.

“As an older player on the team, 
as well as Jason [Le], we are concen-
trating on setting a good example 
for the team through hard work and 
persistence,” Akman said.

Going into this season, Armstrong 
had set reasonable goals for the 
team. 

“Basically, it was to find a com-
petitive outfit, a competitive group,” 
Armstrong said. “Expectations, being 
realistic, it’s a young group. Although 
I think we may see the best of them 
next year. I think we have a good 
group to grow for the next couple 
years. It’s not to win the NCAA, but 

to get into the playoffs.”
Armstrong believed that the 

Tritons’ games this past weekend 
against Cal State San Marcos and Cal 
State Los Angeles, along with the 0-3 
loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills 
on Sept. 19, could have decided his 
team’s hopes. Following the losses 
to Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
Cal State San Marcos, Armstrong 
changed the team’s philosophy.

“It’s going to be one game at a 
time now, just trying to win the next 
game and developing the players,” 
Armstrong said. 

While the UCSD men’s soccer 
program used to be very successful 
and is now trying to salvage hope

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007

Staff Writer

After losing many key players, 
including its top scorer and starting 
goalkeeper, the UCSD men’s water polo 
team looks completely different than last 
year’s squad, which finished first place 
in the West Water Polo Association 
and third place in the NCAA Division 
II. Despite their challenges, the Tritons 
are currently 7-5 for this season, with 
their next game coming against Loyola 
Marymont University on Sept. 27. 

With only one starter from last sea-
son’s team still playing, UCSD is push-
ing the youth movement: starting a 
freshman in the goal and a sophomore 
at the two-meter position. 

“We are a very young team that is 
inexperienced and not battle-tested,” 
coach Denny Harper said.

The Tritons lost their star player 
from last year, Ty Lackey, to graduation. 
Lackey was UCSD’s leading scorer last 
season and was one of three finalists for 
the 2006 Peter J. Cutino award, which 
is awarded to the nation’s best player. 
The Tritons are also without last year’s 
conference most valuable player Jesse 
Casellini and their starting goalkeeper 
from last season, Jeremy Randall. In 
addition, the coaches made the deci-
sion to red-shirt last season’s starters 
senior utility A.J. Kotanjian and senior 
driver Adnan Jerkovic. 

“If [Kotanjian and Jerkovic] were 
playing, we would probably be ranked 
higher right now,” Harper said. 

With all these key players from last 
season no longer competing for the 
team, there is more pressure on the 
remaining players to make up for the 
lost players, especially sophomore two-
meter defender Steven Donohoe, the 
Tritons’ lone returning starter.    

“All he had to do was guard last 

year,” Harper said of Donohoe. “Now 
he has to score goals too.”

Harper has his choice of three 
freshmen in Adam Rule, Mark Stemler 
and Chris Huffman for the open goal-
keeper position. However, after playing 
12 games, it is still unclear who will get 
the spot as the starter in the goal.

“We went with Adam Rule out of 
Bellarmine Prep for a while but, in 
his defense, he was a little bit over-
whelmed,” Harper said. “The jump 
from high school to college is huge. We 
played Mark for most of the [Northern 
California Tournament], but in any 
given game, any one of them could 
be playing and not necessarily for the 
whole game.”  

With their goalkeeper situation 
in doubt, the Tritons have struggled 
defensively this season: the team has 
given up double digits in goals in all of 
its losses this year. 

Despite their defensive woes, the 
Tritons have played fairly well con-
sidering huge changes to their lineup. 
UCSD started out the season going 
2-2 in the Triton Invitational against 
ranked teams on Sept. 1 and Sept. 2. 

The Tritons followed that up by post-
ing a 3-1 record in the Inland Empire 
Tournament on Sept. 8 and Sept. 9, los-
ing 12-10 against host Redlands. 

“We played very well against under-
ranked teams in the tournament,” 
Harper said. “We didn’t play very well 
against Redlands, but you have to give 
Redlands credit. It was a setback, a 
wakeup call telling us that we have to 
continue to train very hard.”

UCSD went 2-2 in the Northern 
California Tournament in Berkeley on 
Sept. 15 and Sept. 16 against tough 
competition. The Tritons opened with a 
tough 9-6 loss to Cal State Long Beach,

If the opening weeks of the 2007 
season serve as any indication of 
future success, the UCSD women’s 
soccer team will be disappoint-
ed with any finish that does not 
improve upon its 2006 campaign. 
The Tritons, who last year made it 
to the NCAA quarterfinals, have 
kicked off this year meeting already 
high expectations, compiling a near-
perfect 8-0-1 record, including their 
latest win: a 2-1 comeback thriller 
over Cal State Los Angeles on Sept. 
23. Head coach Brian McManus’ 
squad was ranked as the pre-sea-
son’s sixth best team in the country, 
but its explosive start has bumped it 
up to No. 2 in the national poll.

The immaculate start reflects the 
hard work put in by a team deter-
mined to move past the departure of 
last year’s graduating seniors. Four 
former senior starters, most notably 
All-American midfielders Megan 
Dickey and Kelley Cochran, left a 
hole in McManus’ attacking offense, 
but the returning players have more 
than filled that void, outscoring 
their opponents 21-4 over the first 
nine games.

The brilliant beginning, accord-
ing to junior forward Natasha 
Belak-Berger, is boosting the team’s 

morale and helping push it toward 
its goals.

“It gives us a lot of confidence in 
our team,” Belak-Berger said. “We 
have a lot of talent on this team and 
starting 7-0 proves that to ourselves. 
Obviously we want to go out and 
win every game, but our main goal 
is to make it to the NCAA finals, all 
while playing good soccer and hav-
ing fun. Last year we made it to the 
round of eight and this year we want 
to go farther.”

UCSD opened the season on 
Aug. 25 with a 3-1 win over the 
University of Nebraska at Omaha, 
and continued its perfect preseason 
with two more wins against Hawaii 
Pacific University and Brigham 
Young University at Hawaii. With 
three impressive games under their 
belt, the Tritons were well pre-
pared for their California Collegiate 
Athletic Association league opener 
versus Cal State San Bernardino. 
The match proved to be more dif-

ficult than previous games, but the 
resilient team edged out a 2-1 win. 
Belak-Berger started the 2007 CCAA 
season in style, scoring in the 15th 
minute of play. After another first-
half goal by junior midfielder Kelly 
Mayo, the Cal State San Bernardino 
Coyotes went on the offensive, out-
shooting the Tritons 7-2 over the 
final 45 minutes, but junior keeper 
Jessica McGovern made four fan-

X-COUNTRY 
PASSES EARLY 
SEASON TESTS 

WITH EASE
By Jake Blanc
Staff Writer

With a new head coach and 
an impressive collection of senior 
leadership, this year’s cross country 
team looks poised to improve upon 
its solid 2006 campaign. Last year, 
UCSD’s season ended with a 16th-
place finish at the NCAA National 
Championships on the women’s side 
and a fifth place finish at the NCAA 
West Regionals for the men. 

At the coaching helm this year will 
be Nate Garcia, who, in his first year, 
is taking over after the resignation of 
Ted Van Arsdale, the previous coach 
of 15 years. Garcia had previously 
served as a Triton assistant coach and 
is looking forward to continuing the 
tradition of excellence that he was a 
part of for the last decade as both a 
runner and a coach.

“Every year our goal is to make it 
to nationals,” Garcia said. “We always 
want to represent the university and 
the western region. As a new coach 
I want to maintain consistency with 
what coach Van Arsdale had estab-
lished for 15 years. Obviously I am a 
different coach with different styles 
so there will be some changes. This 
program has been so successful that 
there is no real need to make any big 
changes.”

While the rest of the UCSD stu-
dent body was in mid-summer form 
with no thoughts of school, the cross-
country team was prepping for its 
season-opening meet against Point 
Loma Nazarene University on Aug. 
25. The Triton men started the season 
off in fine form, placing seven of the 
top nine finishers for a 15-point vic-
tory. The women, owning three of the 
top eight positions, took second to 
the Nazarene Sea Lions. 

The Triton women used their 
second-place finish to propel them-
selves to an astounding performance 
at the UC Irvine Invitational two 
weekends later. The meet, which 
was comprised mostly of Division I 
universities, is one of the toughest 
on the season schedule. But instead 
of backing down, the team took it 
upon itself to prove that UCSD can 
compete with any school, regardless 
of division. The women took fifth 
place out of 20 teams, with the men 
claiming the sixth-place spot. 

Leading the pack for the Tritons 
were senior captain Dianne Dunn 
and senior Emily McGregor, who 
ran on the women’s five-kilometer 
course. McGregor’s time of 18 min-
utes, 24 seconds was the fastest for 
any non-D-I athlete. Senior Jake

WOMEN’S 
VOLLEYBALL 
AIMING FOR 

D-II TITLE
By Matt Croskey
Staff Writer

The UCSD women’s volleyball 
team entered its 2007 campaign 
boasting an impressive resume 
from last season: California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
runner-up, NCAA D-II Pacific 
Regional champion and one of the 
Elite Eight teams at the NCAA D-II 
Championships.

Such a successful season should 
give third-year head coach Tom 
Black assurance that this year’s 
Tritons can duplicate their prede-
cessors; but even he knows that the 
season is long and that there are 
many surprises in store.

“[The CCAA] is the toughest 
conference in the country,” Black 
said. “Every night is important. We 
played a much tougher preseason
