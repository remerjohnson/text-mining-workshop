QuotM In Review 
SAN FRANCISCO - The 
University of California plans 
to review its medical school 
admission procedures 
following claims of reverse 
discrimination; in response to 
a study raising questions of 
whether policies at UC 
medical schools conform to a 
1978 Supreme Court ruling. 
The court ruled that race may 
not be the only factor in 
determining admission, but it 
may be used as a factor. 
According to Jerry and Ellen 
Cook, who conducted the 
study, UC medical schools 
may be violating the Supreme 
Court ruling, citing statistics 
showing that almost all 
medical students accepted 
from under-represented 
groups have grades and test 
scores near the lower end of 
the scale. 

Wilson OK. New 
CSU Campus 
SACRAMENTO - The CSU 
system will be adding another 
campus, as a result of a bill 
signed by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
The bill was the final legisla-
tive hurdle for the creation of 
CSU Monterey Bay, which 
will be built at the former 
Fort Ord military base. 
CSUMB is scheduled to open 
in the Fall of 1995 with fewer 
that 1,000 students. 

Stanford Fined for 
ttarz.dou. waste 
PALO ALTO - Stanford 
University will pay $995,000 
for the mishandling of 
hazardous waste, according to 
school and state officials. The 
payment is a settlement 
resulting from five years of 
violations, in which state and 
Santa Clara inspectors found 
open and leaking containers 
of hazardous waste and in one 
case discovered that hazard-
ous waste had been poured 
into the sewer.

One of Lazarus' first arguments 
claims that Irons shows "astonishing 
carelessness with constitutional law. " 
The remark stems from Irons ' asser-
tion that, "The Courts have the ulti-

Lazarus argues that because judges 
lack the power of law enforcement 
they have been given the paramount 
responsibility of defining laws and

Services Held for USAir Victim 
MEMORIAL: Heiligenberg 
remembered as a man of modesty 
By Tom Barkley 
Guardian Reporter 

Memorial services were held for Walter 
HeiJigenberg, neuroscience professor at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography (SIO)on Friday, Sept. 
30 by the tide pool of the Stephen Birch Aquarium-
Museum. He was among the vidims of the Sept. 8 
USAir jetliner crash outside of Pittsburgh. 

Heiligenberg established a world-wide reputa-
tion in the field of neuroscience while at SIO 
through his studies of the informational process-
ing in the nervous_systems of electri~ fish. 

Born in Berlin in 1938, Heiligenberg spent his 
war-tom childhood moving betwc!en different 
Gennan towns, according to fellow Scripps pro-
fessor Ted Bullock. In 1963, he earned a doctoral 
degreeSlUMlil cum /Qude in zoology at the Univer-
sity of Munich and spent the neictlO years with the 
Max Planck Institute at Seewiesen under the guid-
ance of Nobel Prize Laureate Konrad Lorenz. 

Arriving at Scripps in 1973 IS a visiting scien-
tist in the neurobiology unit, "Walter immediately 
hit it off with our electric fish, learning secrets 
from them that we had never known, u he bIoa-
IOIIIed" inlO a pat scientist, BulJock said. 

-He aIIo hit it off with our faculty: Bullock 
added. "1bia visitina fint-doc WII on the faculty 
within a year of his arrival and a fuD profeaor 
within another year."

behavior and neuroscience, and produced a num-
ber of doctorates in both departments. , 

Assenior editorofGeneral Comparative Physi-
ology, said Cornell University professor Andrew 
Bass, "Walter nourished the growth of 
neuroethology internationally and particularly in 
the United States. He was to be the incoming 
president of the Society of Neuroethology, and the 
entire field will be diminished by his absence." 

In 1991, Heiligenberg received his first David 
Sparks Prize in systems neurophysiology, and was 
elected a member of the American Aqdemy of 
Arts and Sciences two years later. A modest man, 
he never told even friends and family about win-
ning these awards, recalled long-time friend and 
colleague Mark Konishi, professor at the Califor-
nia Institute of Technology. 

HeiJigenberg distinguished between the pro-
ducers and consumers of science, Bullock ex-
plained, considering himself one of the former. 
"He astounded his colleagues by never sitting at a 
desk - he didn't havea desk. [By] never dictating 
to a secretary or counseling a student, but sitting in

Season Over for 
P.E. Department 
RECREAnON: Students must 
soon 'pay to play' without credit 
By Dan Kraft 
Senior Staff Writer 

Rumors surrounding the imminent demise of 
UCSO's P.E. department were recently confirmed 
by UC President Jack Peltason, m a letter officially 
disestablished on Dec. 3"1 of this year. 

Although Peltason made the final decision, 
recommendations from UCSO's Academic Sen-
ate and various university departments favored the 
move. 

According to Nick Spitzer, chairman of the 
Academic Senate and professor of biology, the 
disestablishment has been in the works "for at least 
two years, but these mailers [were investigated] 
substantially in advance of that. The diminution of 
the Physical Education Department over the past 
few years in combination with the [budget] crunch 
contributed to this decision. 

"Our recommendation was submitted to Presi-
dent Peltason only after enormous deliberation 
and debate," Spitzer said. "Every effort is being 
made to retain the opportunities for students which 
P.E. represented," 

Most ofthe debate took place at a May 9 forum 
where students, community members and faculty 
made pleas to save the department. Department 
supporters argued that the P.E. budget was only 
one-tenth of one percent of the total academic 
budget. Supporters also claimed that the 
department's demise had been planned years ear-
lier when the university failed to fill vacancies in 
the department left by retiring instructors. Admin-
istrators, however, argued that the academic bud-
get was simply too small and that the functions of 
the P.E. department could be satisfied by the 
recreation department. 

"The recreation department will be looking to 
incorporate as many of the sports as possible, " said 
Joseph Watson, vice chancellor of student affairs. 
"The main difference will be that the classes will 
no longer carry credit." 

Watson said that not all of the decisions re-
garding the disestablishm~t of the department 
have been finalized. 

"Weare still thinking that [the transfers] will be 
done, but it hasn 't been done administratively as of 
yet," Watson said. 

Details of tbe' dissolution will iikely be re-
solved at a meeting scheduled between the new 
dean of the Arts and Humanities Department, 
where P.E. WII previously loca&ed, and the vice 
chancellor of academic affairs. 

It is not yet known which courses will be added

Students to Wake Up 
To Emergency Drill 
SIMULAnGN: Resident deans, advisors and students 
prepare for a real-hie crisis 
ByM .. ,. '.1 
Guardian Reporter 

Students campus-wide will wake 
up tomorrow morning to the shrill 
sounds of fire bells and sirens for the 
annual emergency drill. 

The drill, beginning at 7: 15 a.m. 
and ending at 8:00 a.m., is an effort by 
the UCSD Housing 
and Dining SeIVices, 
and Residential Life 
Emergency Prepared-
ness Committee to 
educale studcnlS about 
hoY( to cope with po-
tential emergencies, 
such as the possibility 
of a major earthquake. 

For the driD, studenL'i have volun-
teered to simulate injuries, such as 
broken legs, cuts, bruises and abra-
sions. Resident advisors trained to 
deal with these proble~ will then 
give the appropriate medical attention 
to each student. 

"Every RA. has a certain respon-
sibility they Ire 
supposecltododur-
ing the drill. Check 
for names ... make 
sure everybody 
gets out of the

sure nobody is

visor Eugene Son. "If a real emer-

and to know where to

"The scariest 

thing is that a lot of students don't

if there is an alarm," Kromwell said. 
"It would be a much bigger inconve-

added. 

Not only is the drill meant. to let 
studentS know which areas are safe to

it is also planned to help resident

AtkinsOil Faces a Possible 
$6.5 Million Court Default 
By M8Ianne v.,.a 
St." Writer 

ClwIcellor Richard Atkinson may face a 
$6.5 million default rulingagainst him for aUeg-
edly violatinJ a former University employcc's 
civil righll. The default ruling, also filed against 
former campus Police Chief John Anderson, 
was entered in District Court on Aug. 30 of Ibis 
year by Don Lake, a fonner asaistant teacher at 
the UCSD Early Achievement Qnter. 

Lake filed his original complaint on July 8, 
1994 against the university, the UC Board of 
Regents, 0Ia.nce11or Atkinson, Early Childhood 
Edl!Cltion ~EC) DireCtor .Josephine Foulks, 
ECECSupervisorTrudyCampbcIl, former cam-
pus police chief John Anderson, security officer 
William A. Macintyre, an unknown UCSD dis-
patcher, an unknown campus protection agent, 
four unknown campus security officers and La 
JoDa Towing. 

The twelve counts in the lawsuit included 
violation of civil rights, assault and battery, 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, neg-
ligence, conspiracy and defamation of charac-
ter. 

All of the defendants except Atkinson and 
Anderson responded to the summons and their 
cases IIC pending. 

-

Aa:ording to Vann Jahnes-Smith of the 
UCSD Rmk Management OffICe, Atkinson and 
Anderson did not ICIuaIly default because they 
were never properly served. 

"If we are properly seIVed, then we will 
respond," Jahnta-Smith said. 

A Nov. 28 fcderaI court hearing will decide 
the issue. 

Lake's alleged mistreatment began when 
Director Foulks asked him to temporarily work 
in the kitchen of the Early Education Center, 
while he WIS hired IS an assistant teacher. Sev-
eral months later, when Lake asked to return to 
his duties IS a teacher, he claims he was threat-
ened with the loss of his job ifhe did notcontinue 
to voluntarily work in the kitchen. 

"As an employee, I was treated differently. 
No other teachers were made to work in the 
kitchen as I was," Lake said. 

Lake claimed he was then denied participa-
tion in staff mcctings, work seminars and other 
ECEC staffactivities. He said he unsuccessfully 
tried to mediate the situation through the Em-
ployees Union and the Employee Relations 
Department 

Lake claimed he soon became ill from job-
related stress and was hospitalized for a week in

A.S. Appoints New Officers 
VICE PRESIDENTS: Election candidates flll new positions 
By EI.loe C.muao 
Senior Staff Writer 

The final two AS. position's left vacant by 
last year's controversial election were filled 
recently by AS. President Carla Tesak. 

The positiom became vacant following last 
Sp'ing'sA.S.JudicialBoard'sremovalofnewly 
elected Vice President of Fmance Jennie Craig 
and Vice President External Naomi Falk. 

Tesak appointed last year's Vice President 
of Finance candidate Silvia Sfiligoi to the posi-
lion of vice president of finance, which was 
vacated by Jennifer Craig. Craig in tum was 
appointed to vice president of external affairs, 
which was vacated by Naomi FalX. 

Falk was appointed as the A.S. representa-
tive to the University of California Student 
Association (UCSA), a duty recently separated 
from the responsibililes of the vice president of 
external affairs. 

Craig and Falk were removed from office 
last May, after the Judicial Board found the two 
running mates guilty of six election bylaw 
violations. 

Although the decision barred Craig and 
Falk from reapplying for appointment to their 
offICCS, it placed no restraints on applying for 
other AS. positions. 

As AS. president, it was Tesak 'sduty to fill 

the vacancies. Tesak's appointments were 
approved by a board of senator representa-
tives from each college. 

"I had established before that if I had not 
gotten qualified applicants,l would wait until 
Fall," Tesak said. "But [Craig and FalX] are 
extremely qualified. The case with JeMY was 
whether or not to overlook [the judicial board 
decision] and her extreme qualification made 
me overlook it." 

According to Tesak, Sfiligoi's appoint-
ment was immediate because student organi-
zation funding decisions were being made at 
the time the vice president finance offICe was 
vacated. "She was basically the most quali-
fied person who applied," Tcsak said. "She 
had some really good ideas for changing 
things and seemed to have it all together." 

However, the vice president external and 
UCSA representative positions were less 
pressing, and given more consideration be-
fore a final appointment was made. 

"I'm very fortunate to be doing the part of 
the external office job that I enjoy most," said 
Falk, who seIVed as the ASUCSD campus 
offi<;e director for UCSA last year. As the 
UCSA representative this year, Falk chairs 
the UCSA Fees and Financial Aid committee

Does the planned Smithsonian memorial for the Japanese victims of the atom bombs rewrite history? 

AN EMPIRE 

The Bomb Saved Lives 
By Derek van Holten, Contributing Opinion Writer 

The Smithsonian exhibit 
depicts the Japanese 
as Innocently defendln, 
their land against the 
United States, while 
Ignoring their savage 
tour through Southeast 
Asia. 

Next August marks the 50th 
anniversary of the dropping of the atomic 
bombs on Hiroshima and NagaSaki in Japan. 
In remembrance, the Smithsonian Institute's 
National Air and Space Museum has planned 
an exhibit which will include the front hull of 
the Enola Gay, the 8-29 that dropped the 
bomb on Hiroshima. However, instead of 
planning an exhibit which accurately depicts 
the war in the PacifIC, the Smithsonian has 
opted to rewrite history. 

The new, distorted view shows the Japa-
nese as innocent, honorable victims; defend-
ing their homeland against savage attacks by 
ruthless Americans. The Smithsonian justi-
fies this by saying it will oot glorify any 
American military action: "We just can't af-
ford to make war a heroic event," said Mu-
seum Director Martin Harwit. However, the 
same exhibit would provide a significant 
amount 10 the remembrance of the noble, 
brave kamikaze pilots of Japan. They are 
descnbed as "youth, their bodice overflowing 

with life," with their elaborate rituals, spirituality and bravery. 
Apparently, their acts of war were indeed heroic. 

How can the Smithsonian allege that the Japalleac killing of 
Americans deserve praise, while American soldien warrant no 
glorified rerniniKence? This is not to say we should romanticize 
war, but that we should record the events accurately, recognizing 
that both sides killed, neither more savagely than the other. 

While the Smithsonian is doing its pari to rewrite the history 
books, the Enola Gay exhibit is only one representation of an 
even broader theme currently perpetuated throughout the 
United States. As a recentNew York Times editorial points 

â¢ 

out, condemning all American history as "a woeful catalog ~.;:::.., 
of crimes and aggressions against the helplesspcoplesofthe 
earth" is becoming increasingly popular. Modem observation of 
history too often deems all U.S. military action unjustified and 
heartless. 

The Smithsonian exhibit depicts the Japanese as innocently 
defending their land against the United States, whi.le. ignoring 
their savage tour tluough Southeast Asia. Japan's so-<:aIled 
"Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" consisted of running 
roughshod over any country in its path. The Japaneae claimed 
they would lead East Asia to greatness on a world scale, but that 
path to that greatness included massive destruction and murder. 
First, Japan attacked Indochina, booting out the French. Next, it 
moved to Burma and then further south, to Malaysia. Eventually, 
Japan '5 "sphere" included virtually everything in Southeast-
Asian waters. 

And what of JapM's most barbaric attack: its invasion of 
mainland China? Where in the Smithsonian exhibit do we hear 
aboulthis unprovoked assault, most notably the savage massacres 
in Nanking? The "courlpOUS" and "brave" Japanese soldiers 
lined up and shot over 300,000 civilians, raping thousands along 
the way for good measure. Few scenes from World War II are as 
brutal and hwtIess as the Japanese II\ISSICreS in auna. Yet. the' 
exhibit ignores them, cboosing instead to paint the Japanese 
soldier as a defender instead of an attacker. 

Depicting these Japaneae aoIdien as victims ignorea their role 
â¢ instipton. This includca the aneaIt aIIack on Pearl Harbor in 
1941. Lost in the shufIJe of the Smithaonian exhibit is the 
fundamental fact that Japan attacked the United States, which 
hardly quaIifiea the laf*ae U victims.

COMMENTARY: The government's medical experiments should not include nonconsenting human subjects 
THE SECRET LIFE OF THE u. S. GOVERNMENT 

By AInIt ANN.a 
ConttlbutltW ()pinion Writer 

The tbawina of the Cold War has 
uncovered a realm of acandaIs that 
our leaders probIbly wish would melt 
and disappear. While some c:hooIe to 
laugh it off as a James Bond fantasy, 
our government is up to more than 
you can imagine. 

And the offenses lie not between 
Dltion&, but rather against us - the 
citizens of the United States. 

In the last 50 years, leading offi-
cials in WUhington, D.C. have man-
aged to appropriate tax dollars to fund 
a Iup number of medial and "na-
tional security" projects, such as drug 
and radiation studies. The test sub-
jects in many of these projects, most 
of which are dangerous, have been 
human. 

The real violation, however, is that 
II)05t of these subjects weren't in-
formed of the testing they were under-
going. 

In 1955, Willowbrook St. Hospi-
tal in Staten Island, N.Y., deliberately 
infected a number of rewdcd chil-
dren with hepatitis. Neither the chil-
dren nor their parents were asked for 
their oonsenl 

In the mid-I960s, 34 inmates at 
Concord State Prison in Massadlu-
setts were given psilocybin (PCP), a 
dangerous drug that produces halluci-
nogenic effects. 

Once again, the subjects weren't 
given the choice to refuse the doses 
nor were they told what was being 
given to them. 

However, such drug-research 
studies were not confined to the re-

tuded and oonvided. In fact, virtu-
ally every citizen of our supposedly 
open and honest country is readily 
vulnerable to such manipulation. U.S. 
college and universities comprise a 
large portion of the offenders. 

In the 196Os, the UCMedial Cen-
ter at San Francisco conducted radia-
tion tests on random patients. One 
man is now suing for $10 million, 
claiming a dental appointment turned 
into a nightmare of pills and injec-
tions. Only now have authorities dis-
covered morclhan 1,IXXl patients were 
involved ""7 all unknowingly. 

1beI>epartment of Energy claims 
it was receiving over 700 calls per 
hour when it set upa botIine for people 
who suspected they were victims of 
this cruel science project. 

Could it be, every time you pick 
up some medication from the phar-
macy,you'reactually geUingviruses? 
And if so, how can you tell? You 
can't. 

A buic code of rights got thrown 
out somewhere among the medical 
waste. 

Our government ~nnecessarily 
placed thousands of innocent people 
at risk and more than likely oontinues 
to do so. 

Strangely enough, there are those 
who argue that government medical 
testing is the only way to propess. 

George Voelz, a member of a lab 
that oonducted such testing, was 
quoted in theNewMoicM assaying, 
"We were proud of the work. We~lt

. time, the parents knew what was hap-
pening and they consented to iton the 
grounds they were furthering research. 

How far will we go for the sake of 
science and how do we know if we've 
gone 100 far? 

Proponents of the government's 
medical testing claim there's no pos-
sible way of finding cures without 
testing. 

Testing has truly broughton great 
advances, especially in the scientific 
fields. Yet, at the loss of public safety 
and trust, the results are compara-
tively minimal. 

Not only does our trust disappear, 
but so does our money. Compiling the 
total dollars spent on this type of test-
ing wouldn't be worth the time or 
effort, as government offICials have 
conveniently lost many records. The 
public never voted to allow spending 
of our tax money on Nazi-like re-
search practices. 

The University of Wisconsin, 
Madison, claims it spent $325 million 
on research in 1993 alone. A portion 
of the funding was through agencies 
such as the National Science Founda-
tion, which is supported by taxes. 
Although it maintains strict regula-
tions on testing today, university offi-
cials admit they can't be certain of 
what happened in the labs a few de-
cades ago. 

If you're wondering how these 
studies have benefited the public, 
don't look at your everyday conve-
niences and safeties. According to 
the apparent trend, the government 
has taken the fruits of its deceit and 
swall,?wed them in defense projects. 

The UC system manages the Los 
Alamos laboratories which produces 
nuclear warheads for the U.S. stock-
pile. 

All the sophisticated gadgdry com-
monly flaunted in spy movies actu-
ally exists. The defense department 
regularly uses a satellite tracking sys-
tem which is 10 times more accurate 
than the civilian Global Positioning 
System (GPS). However, the com-
mon navigator can't get his hands on 
the military's system, even though it 
could lower the rate of lost ships and 
airplanes. It's all out of reach - not 
exactly a sign of a government for the 
people. 

It's ironic that research conducted 
in the name of national security in-
flicted trauma upon the nation's own 
citizens. 

While our country 's soldiers were 
overseas, attempting to end Hitler's 
bizane research practices, top scien-
tists were performing similar experi-
ments back home. 

Although it would be silly to con-
stantly worry about falling victim 10 
government experiments, there isnev-
ertheless the possibility it could hap-
pen again. 

The regulations are gelting pro-
gressively stronger, but more work 
needs to be done. So far, the future 
doesn't promise a day when we can 
feci confident in our government's 
doings. 

If you believe you have been a 
subject in an unauthorized test on 
campus, in a lab or a hospital, call the 
Department of Energy at 1-800493-
2998.

dropped an 110m bomb. That decision 

and the outcome of it should, and 
must, be examined honestly. 

The Smithsonian exhibit will in-
clude proud mell1Ol1bilia of the S09th

crew of the Enola Gay), information 
about the decision 10 drop the bomb, ..

The SmithlOnian exhibit should 
accurately portray the evenll of the 
war in the PacifIC. Though museum 
organizen reClCntly altered the dis-
pia)' somewhat responding 10 com-
plaints from congress and veterans 
group&, the general theme still pre-
vails: Japan is made out to be the 
victim and the United States, the ag-
gressor . 

This is not the firsl time the 
Smithsonian has attempted 10 skew 
history. In 1991, an exhibit on the 
American West depicted pilgrims as 
"lacking true pioneer spirit," westem 

IOrs 10 examine the questions raised 
by our dropping of the bomb in a 
context not draped in patriotism. Visi-
tors can look for themselves at whal 
the bomb did 10 that city and the 
people who lived in it. 

The Japanese were undoubtedly 
the aggressors in World War II and 
the United Stales was, undoubtedly, 
on the side of the "good guys." How-
ever, this does not mean we are with-
out faults or every decision we made 
was beyond reproach. People can and 
should make these judgments for 
themselves. 

1'holIe who argue the museum 
should candy-c:oat the reality of the 
atom bomb or tilt the exhibit 10 alter 
the horrible realities of alOmic war-
fare insull our intelligence. 

War is awful. The dropping of the 
bomb killed over 275,(0) people -
most of them slowly and painfully.

In addition, museum orpnizcn 
recently ran a television special on a 
New Guinea tribe which prIdices

was referred to as having a "wen-

fact that cannibalism was a regular

judgment which we must make with a 
full understanding of the decision's 
oonsequence. That theJapaneseatroci-
ties were despicable can never be a 
jUstifJCIlion for atrocities on our side. 
As the only nation to have ever used a 
nuclear bomb in wartime, we owe 
ourselves. and the world, an honest 
look al whallOk plaa:. 

The debate will probably never be 
resolved, but our understanding of the 
terrible costs involved with deciding 
between invasion or using the alOmic 
bombcan help us understand that these 
decisions, by nature, are enormously 
painful. We must never, even for a

made on the basis of blind patriotism. 

We degrade ourselves, as a people 
and as a nalion, when we color the past

The money is thendislribuled IIIIOngdifferentorpniza-
lions which l88ist those living with HIV. Last year, over 
7,(IX) people participated in the event with hopes thai 
thai number would rise 10 10,000 this year. 

UCSD students, representing various groups on 
campus, were on hand for the pre-walk activities starting 
at 9:00 Lm. Sixteen students from Active Community 
Members II Thurgood Marshall College (A.C.T.) ar-
rived with $160 in pledges. A.c. T Chairperson Susan 
Pinedowassurprised how much money students pledged, 
saying it "was kind of odd that college students gav~ so 

much." 
Other campus organizations iDcluciing Active SIu-

Cyndi Brena,aJao a Wanen senioradded that the walk 
was "an emotional experience," referring to T-shirts 
many walkers wore with photos of loved ODell who had 
died of AIDS. 

However, lOme studenII expressed disappointment 
with the low turoout of UCSD studen ... "I think it's too 
bad that a lot of people from UCSD didn't show up," said 
Revelle freshman Kim Browner, who was walking with 
nine other fellow students. 

The AIDS walkers began their ~k from the County 
Administlltion Building and continued aJong Harbor 
Drive to Halbor Island, concluding back at the starting 
point 

"After I was hospitalized," Lake 
said, "Mrs. Foulks began 10 badger 
me for medical paperwork." 

Lake returned to the university on 
July 12 to return the paperwork which 
Foulks had requested. 

"When I went 10 the center, I acted 
iD very 8eutJemanIy and controlled 
manner, and I never raised my voice, " 
Lake said 

After delivering the paperwork, 
Lake drove off campus and was ar-
rested by a UCSD police offICer. 

Jahnes-Smith said that Lake was 
stopped and arrested, "With the mforÂ·

in the back of the patrol car. They 
detained me there for about 4S min-

Lake said. "Then they towed my 
girlfriend's car. which cost me $66." 

Lake's suit against the university 
was dismissed earhel this year. Ac-
cording to Jahnes-Smlth, Lake also 
went to small claims court over the 
issue of false arrest on Oct. 22, L993 
and lost. 

"At the November hearing [the

In addition, Lazarus wrote, "Irons

of manipulating sentence meaning

Irons denies any wrongdoing and 
claims that the oral arguments from

adding that he picked those which 
stood out in audio quality and force

"When you're editing eight hours 
of argument into 15-20 minutes, you 
have to make decisions about what to 
put in, "Irons said. 

"If [Lamus] thinks we changed 
the intent of what was said before the 
school board, he doesn 'l make a case 
for thaI," Irons added. 

In one of the article's most critical 
passages, Lazarus wrote, "Irons ' 
tapes tum out to be not Supreme 
Court history but rather an electronic 
hash heavily flavored with his own 
biases and predisposilions."

Some Wear Red Ribbons - Two 

UCSD Students Took to Their Bicycles 
BY FRANCISCO DEVRIES, FEATURES EDITOR 

When most tudents visualize their ideal summer it does not include bicycling up 
to 100 miles a day for weeks on end 
in the grueling heat - even if it is 
for a good cause. 

But since 1986, over 700 hearty 
soul - brought together by the 
San Francisco-based organization 
Bike-Aid - have crossed the coun-
try powered only by their own two 
legs. The riders use their trip not 
just as a way to get in shape but as 
a vehicle for education about im-
ponant social issues. 

This year, two UCSD students, 
Marshall College Senior Peter 
Afsari and 1.994 Muir College 
graduate Emily Kauffman joined 
the over 60 people to cross the 
country under their own steam. 

For the last two 

to Washington route, felt the hous-
ing was a lillie chaotic at times. 

"We would pull into town and 
not know really where we were 
staying [and sometimes] we would 
havetoend up camping," Kauffman 
said. 

In general, Pugh says that com-
munities are extremely welcoming 
to Bike-Aid. 
Coptn. with AIDS 

This year, there was "a lot of 
trepidation" because AIDS is such 
a controversial topic, especially in 
rural America. Several hosts can-
celed because of the theme, but in 
general, "the riders were surprised 
that people were as receptive as 
they were," Pugh said. 

"In Provo, Utah, which is like 
one of the most conservative towns 
in the [United States], we were in a 

years, Bike-Aid 
has focused on the 
AIDS epidemic. 
Riders raised 
money for AIDS/ 
HIV ol'ganiza-
tions, as well as 
used their trip as a 
tool to raise 
awareness about 
AIDS and HIV 
throughout the 
United States.

Pugh added 
that AIDS has re-
ally reached rural 
America and that 
people who have 
the virus or were 
friends with 
AIDS victims 
were "real ex-

riders" because

The group moved from com-

night in church basements, YMCAs 
and host families' homes. 

The housing of riders is "really 
random," according to Bike-Aid 
Outreach Coordinator Robin Pugh. 
Bike-Aid starts with a core group 
of hosts, but then just works the 
phones, even using the Yellow 
Pages on occasion, to find youth-
oriented groups that might help 
find hosts.

See BlKE-AID, Page is as I saw many of my friends after 

a summer away. 
Catching up on our summers 

usually left me with the impres-
sion that everybody did pretty 
much the same thing for three 
months. You know, work a little, 
go to the beach a little. Maybe 
take a summer schoor class. 

Every now and again, some 
adventurous soul would tell of his 
backpacking trip through Europe 
or his job on a boat in Alaska. Not 
me. I stayed the path. In short, I 
did not take the road less travelled. 

Returning to school this fall, 
however, proved to be a bit differ-
ent for me. That's because for six 
weeks this summer I rode a bi-
cycle from Brownsville, TX. to 
Washington, D.C., a total of2,200 
miles, with a fund-raising organi-
zation called Bike-Aid. 

It would be easy to look back 
and rave about what a great time it 
was. Getting up, 81urping down a 
bowl of Frosted Flakes and then 
hilling the road. Seeing new 
things, meeting new people and 
moving on to another town. 

But it wasn't that simple. I had 
never ridden a bike further than 
20 miles, much less 2,000. 

Every morning I crawled out 
of my sleeping bag sore, still ex-
hausted from yesterday's 75 miles 
and dreading the miles of black 
asphalt that lay ahead. 

It was hot. It was humid. My 
butt hurt. A lot. 

Every now and then I could 
think of nothing else except my 
bed at home. I missed my friends 
back at home. I missed I cool San

bracelets that the family had made 
for the whole group. The mother 
said, simpl y, "Thanks for what you 
are doing." 

"(Bike-Aid) isan incredibly em-
powering experience, " because of 
the opportunity it gives a person to 
involve themselves personally in 
an issue, Pugh said. 

Kauffman agreed. "A lot of 
times you sort offorget what you're 
doing on the trip ... you're just d0-
ing the motions .... I (have] always 
enjoyed more interacting with 
people on a physical, up-front level. 
[It made) the issue more real."

very different people day-in and

ingly adaptable to anything ... .. " 

"It's hard be<:ause you need your 
own space and your own space is 
so limited. So,solimited. Youtrea-
sure the smallest thing, like if you 
could find a little comer in the 
church or in the auditorium where 
you're sleeping, and that's like your 
little comer, then that's like the 
greatest thing," Kauffman said. 

Food also often became a hotly 
debated topic. "Try c:ating with 21 
people. It's really hard, [especially) 
when you have vegans, vegetar-
ians and, like, carnivores. It's very 
challenging," Kauffman said. 

Although people had personality 
conflicts, Kauffman said, the group 
really became "connected" by the 
end of the 3,600-mile journey. 

But food and personality con-
flicts weren't the only challenges

- the ride illelf is not without its 
reAJ risks. This year went without 
major incident, but il;' 1991, two 
riders were killed by a truck com-
ing around a tight tum. In addition, 
"one penon was hit by a plow last 
year," Pugh said. 

During Kauffman's trip, the 
weather was the most frequent 
source of danger. While she said 
the group was lucky - just miss-
ing huge storms or intense heat 
waves - on one occasion, the 
riders ended up in the middle of a 
tornado watch, with 2O-mile-per-
hour head-winds and hail storms. 

"I mean, it was bad weather. It 
was bad weather," she said. 

On another occasion, in Vir-
ginia, the group rode through sheets 
of rain that brought visibility down 
to near zero. Five people "wiped 
out" on the same railroad crossing 
during the storm. 

The trip was also a battIe against 
physical exhaustion. 

"There were sometimes when 
you just do not feel like doing it. 
You'rejustlike, 'I've been cycling 
for the past four weeks. I'm tired. I 
cannot get on my bike today.''' 

When it got unbe~rable, riders 
could spend the day driving the 
support van - a duty that partici-
pants share on a route .. 

Surprisingly, the most physi-
cally demanding portions of the 
trip were not any mountain range, 
according to Kauffman. 

"Probably the most cballeng-
ing would be one of those Oat 
states .... Nevada was really hard 
sometimes because you are so \lX-
posed [to the weather]." 

In all, Virginia won the award 
for Kauffman's least favorite state.

According Pugh, Bike-Aid has 
raised over $1 million for domestic 
and intemational social and health 
development organizations since 
1986, including $135,000 for AIDS 
projec:ts this year. 

The money is raised through cor-
porate and individual sponsorship 
of the riders. Bike-Aid participants 
must get enough sponsors to cover 
the cost of the trip. While Bike-Aid 
is fairly flexible, riders traveling 

coast-to-coast are expected to raise 
around $3,600, or roughly $1 per 
mile. The same ratio holds for the 
shoner routes. 

Money raised by Bike-Aid goes 
to a wide variety of groups. Both 
domestic and international devel-
opment organizations submit grant 
applications for review by a Bike-
Aid committee made up of staff, 
board members and the riders them-
selves. 

One such grant recipientÂ· is the 
Ah-tah organization in Cameroon. 

FEATURES 13 

.. Ah-tah" roughly means "deep pit." 
It is used to replKc the term" AIDS," 
which is an English acronym with-
out any meaning in other languages. 

According to Pugh, Ah-tah uses 
tribal dance and music to educate 
people about the AIDS epidemic. 
The Bike-Aid grant to Ah-tah went 
to cover the group 's transportation 
and training expenses, as well fund 
the production of an audio cassette 
which it distributes after its perfor-
mances. 

Domestically, the Nevada AIDS 
foundation won a grant for ali AIDS 
peer-education program. Because 
it is illegal for AIDS to even be 
discussed in Nevada public schools, 
a group of high school students are 
organizinA an educational group to 
operate outside of the school sys-
tem. Bike-Aid donated funds to 
help get the project off the ground. 
Next Up 

The experience, Kau ffman says, 
was definitely a positive one. 

"It's always best to be aware of 
another person's needs and that 's 
probably the most important thing 
we learned on the trip. Whether it 
be within the group or in the com-
munity, to understand where 
[people] are coming from." 

Next year, Bike-Aid plans to 
focus on "environmental 
sustainability." According to Pugh, 
the theme will encompass every-
thing from education about sus-
tainable agriculture to consumer-
ism to envi ronmentally friendly 
transportation. 

"Bicycles are a legitimate form 
of transportation and deserve to be 
treated as such," she explained. 

Anyone interested in Bike-Aid 
should contact its office in San 
Francisco at 415-431-448Q.

TRIP: It was 
roUgh - but it was 
worth it 
ContInued from ..,e 12 
Francisco breeze. I missed cable-
TV. 

There were days when I would 
even question my own sanity. Many 
times I concluded that I was IS 
crazy as everyone told me I WIS 
when they heard about my summer 
plans. Sometimes, crazier. 

On occasion, I WIS convinced I 
could not go on. Probably the low-
est point was on our way to New 
Orleans after a long night in a Ba-
ton Rouge bar. 

Hung over, dehydrated and ex-
hausted after two hours of riding, I 
remember passing a road sign: 

"New Orleans 67 miles." I have a 
pi<:ture with me ltaading next 10 
this marker. I don't look happy. 

But day after day, we pushed 
onward. 

Lunch was uaually a quick sand-
wich by the side of tbe road. At 
first, peanut butter and jelly domi-
nated, but then quickly lost grouod 
to pork rinds, pimento checac and 
barbecued ribs; all local cuisine. 

Dinner WIS at five, sevoa and 
nine, mnsisting of large portions of 
whatever we muld get ou[hands on. 

The weather, although DOt ideal, 
was at least exciting. And if racing 
thunderstorms ever grew tiresome, 
a barrage of man-made obstacles 
was thrown in for good measure. 

One particular incident stays 
fresh in my mind. 

The almost sumal experience 

. The UCSD Gaardiaa 

of viewing a cool yellow plane no 
more than 30 feet 10 my ript and 
ooly 10 feet above the pound 
quicltJy turned sour when it re-
leased cloud of toxic mist. 

I wandered arouad witb no-
where to go, the doud slowly en-
velopiDJ me, feelina more like a 
fruit fly than anyoac ever should. 
"I've been cropduated, .. I remem-
ber tbillkin,. 

1'heIe experiencca, although try-
ing, were obviouaJy not without 
their rewards. They were part of 
what made the trip worthwhile, part 
of what makes me surprised I even 
completed the route. 

For six weeks, I, alon, with my 
group riders, were neither graded 
nor judged, hired nor fired, pun-
ished nor rewarded. We had one 
very tangible goal: to get from point 

'A' to polm '8' (point B bel. a 
IhitJoad further away tIwa poiat A). 
Each day proved 10 be â¢ trial in 
peniatonce, determiaatioa and wiU-
power. 

The human spirit, no longer 
burdened with the daily pressure 
and monotony of ICbooI and work, 
wa allowed to wander a little, was 
allowed to be a little freer. 

Physically, our bodies trans-
formed into living machines, bio-
mechanical contraptions that 
moved legs in a circular fasbion 
when provided enough energy. 

Emotionally, we learned to love 
without condition after hcaringsto-
ries from people who, even while 
suffering from a vicious disease, 
had the remarkable strengtb to f0-
cus on the good things.

Racing without their numberÂ·

"He'll race when be's ready. Thia 
time, it just wlln't neceasary." 

Veteran John Walah took up the 
reigns in Castner's absence, lead-
ing the te.m to â¢ fifth-place finish 
with. 13thÂ·place time of 26:50. 

"[Walsh] r.n phenomen.lly," 
Van Arsdale said. "Older individu-
als led our mens team." 

Walter Dehority streaked to a 
remarkable 15thÂ·place finish with 
a time of 26:52, while teammate 
Robert Ho captured 28th place in 

. a time of 27:10. 
"[Dehority] just hu no fear of 

pain," V.n Arsdale said about his 
selection for Triton male athlete-
ofÂ·the-week. 

UCSD accomplished ill goal of ,. ' 
keeping the gap between all of its 
runners under 60 seconds by 
achieving a 57Â·second differential 
between its first and lut runners. 
Gavin Klinger rounded out the TriÂ· 
ton men's scoring, taking 39th in 
a speedy 27:19. 

"I guess myself and [Castner1 
would be the leaders on the team," 
said Walsh. "But leadership only 
goes so far. We need everyone 
healthy to do well." 

While the Triton male veterans 
continue to mow down opponents, 
Van Arsdale w.s equally pleased' 
with the freshmen's progress, par-
ticularly the sixÂ· and sevenÂ·posi-
'tion runners, Mike Wallace and 
Greg Field. 

"It may seem like there are a 
lot of veteranl'on the men's 
squad," said Walsh. "But really 
there arc a lot of freshman, and 
they're doing awesomely. They're 
doing equally, if not beller, ...... 
[Castner and 1] did when we 
started out." 

The UCSD men's final tally 
was a low 144 points, only 12 
aw.y from third place overall. 
Westmont College, Chico State, 
Stanford .nd C.I Poly Pomona 
stood ahead of the Tritons. 

With the difficult Stanford

DOW look forward to a relaxing

On the second play from IICrim-
mage in this do-or-die drive, Stan set 
a revenal in motion, but failed to get 
out of the play u uy lUI OB -
healthy or otherwiac - would have 
done. This min smelled trouble 
coming when a Raider def~nder 
lurled through Ihe line, so 
Humphries cut him down with a fine 
block. His block, I dare .. y, turned 
a potcntially cruabinl 3-yard Ioas 
into I modest 3-yard pin. Five min-
ulcs before, Stan IuId been in anguish 
and DOW he wu laking the weight 
of I charging defeacJer on u injured 
knee . 

You would never ICC Joe do thai, 
not even in his Sep video pme. 
Sure, Joe's got style. He'll waltz 
down thc field in a two-minute drive 
that will Icave the dcfenac stir-
struck. StIn's attack could never be 
called pretty, but hc'lI1eavc the de-
fense black and blue. 

He does what it takes and IVoids 
the thcatrics. Despite having not 
thrown a single 300-yard game this 
season, he's the top-ranked passer in 
the AFe. He doesn't have I cadre of 
awe-filled worshippers like his up-
coming opponent, but if he needed 
one to win, I'm SUJe he would find 
one. 

As he hobbled along, Humphries 
drove the (]wgcrs 30 yards, firin~ 
short, precise bul1eta from an awk-
ward, painful stance. Now just outÂ· 
side of field goal raD8c, the Charg-
ers faced a fourth-and-one situatIOn 
with less than two minutes to play. 
You'd expect him to hand off or per-
haps to dump it off short to a run-
ning back just past the fil'lt-down 
marker. 

B t Stan did nothing of the son 
He w.lited in the pocket for an ago-
nizing second, Raider linemen surg-
ing :l round him, and passed 
down leld, through traffic, and hit 
his receiver on the numbers tor a 
crucial first down. 

Down by one with less than a 
minul to play and a mere 25 yards 
from the end zone, Joe probably 
woul! have thrown an amazing TD 
pass, ' nless of course a microscopic 
lineba ker hadn't sacked him in the 
backfield. Then the play would have 
gone into the annaJa of the NFL with 
a capitalized, awe-inspiring label 
like The Bullet or some such non-
sense. 

Humphries didn't throw a high-
light film pus to the bIdt of the end 
zone. Hell, be didn't get that'IQ 
.,...at aU. What Humphries did was 
this: He put Inother win in the 
ClIargen' record and kept that zero 
in the 1011 column. He got the ball 
within chip-shot range and then left 
the fi eld. With two ticks left, the 
ClIlrgers got the field goal and won 
thegr,me. 

St .. n th~ for zero touchdowns 
and tossed two inten:eptiom, his fint 
this IICUOn, Ind paued for leas than 
200 yards. But he came back from a 
hit that made him scream in anguish 
and won the game. Not only did Joe 
lose th t day, we wouldn't have seen 
him h('k on the field for weeks it 
he ha taken that hit. 

It very well may come down to 
last-minute heroics on SlHIdlY at 
Jack Murphy Stadium. Plenty of 
excuses will be available for the 
101Â« - it 's going to be bot and loud 
and hard-hitting. But one of thae

bit slowly in the first game, the TriÂ· 
tons battled their way to an 11-3 lead 
and Ippeared to be headed for an 
easy opening-game win. 

The Tigers baliled back, how-
ever, cllwing to within a three-point 
margin at H-S before UCSD re-
gained its poise. The Tritons scoreri 
the last three points of the game with 
freshman setter Christy Thomas 
serving to take the early lead. 

Thomas, who slarted against 
Trinity because regular seller JeMiÂ· 
fer Schofield had been benched for 
disciplinary reasons, gained some 
valuable experience while guiding 
the UCSD offense in the opening 
game win. Schofield returned to 
lineup for games two and three -
gimes which got increasingly 
nerveraclting for the Tritons. 

The second game went to UCSD 
by a 15-9 tally as Harvey, Crochet 
and Ripken powered the Triton ofÂ·

lead. 

In the third and final gam!;;, 
UCSD escaped with a IS-II victory 
to take the match over the upse/-hlln-

"The scores in the games agahst

It was a htlle less than fWD weeks

UCSD was certainly ready forthe

UCSD Splits Two on Road 
NORTHERN EXPOSURE: Tritons (6-5) smother UCSC Slugs, 6-0, fall victim to 
Division I UC Berkeley, 4-0, in last weekend's road trip to Northern California 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

In all the splender and glory of 
winning a national championship, 
there is always that one dark side, 

that one omen, 
that one real 
stitch in every 
national ban-
ner-bearer '5 
side - de-
fending it. 

The 1994 
Triton men's 
soccer team 
(6-5) has cer-
tainly been 
forced to deal 

with the "just-after jinx," but follow-
ing last weekend's Northern Califor-
nia road trip their piayoff-picture ho-
rizon may be getting brighter. 

Although Friday's 4-0 clubbing 
at the paws of the UC Berkeley 
Bears (1-6-1) did little to bolster the 
Tritons' ambitious cause in the al-
ways crucial win-loss column, Head 
Coach Derek Armstrong didn't ex-
pect a miracle-upset win over a Di-
vision I competitor. 

"The best we can hope for is a 
tie," Armstrong said after UCSD's 
1-0 victory over Southern Cal Col-
lege last Wednesday. 

What the Tritons did come away 
with was the experienceÂ·a struggling 
national-title holder needs for a re-
peat run. 

Â«We definitely got something out 
of that game," senior forward Todd 
Curran said. "They put up the most 
pressure we have ever seen before. I 
think we could have played with 
them and we had our chances. They 
had a game plan and did what they 
needed to win . Bul , heard 
(Armstrong] say Ihat this is is besl 
soccer we have played all year. II's 
great experience to face pressure like 

Ihat. " 
Berkeley freshman forward 

Adam Hunter opened the scoring 
with Cal's first two goals, marking 
unassisted at 14:20, and then again 
at 42:30, on a pass from midfielder 
Jeramie 
Perez. 

Forward 
Ryan Franklin 
scored the 
Bears' third 
goal at 66:53 
off an assist 
by sweeper 
Richard 
Weiszmann. 
Franklin later 
assisted Jason 
Young, who 
posted the fi-
naï¿½ score of 
the match. 

The Bears 
outshot 
UCSD 17-11, 
and Cal net-
minder Mark 
Edelen snared 
seven saves. 

UCSD coun-
terpart George 
Allison was 
credited with 
six saves. 

Triton offensive onslaught. By 
game's end, it wun't a pretty sight 
for the hosts. San Diego railed 

uese,~, in an extremely lopsided 
affair. 

The Tritons got on the board

entrenched in the nation's most elite, 
collegiate level of play, produced im-
mediate dividends in the San 
Diego's second match of the road 
trip. 

The UCSC Slugs, who had been 
boasting a surprisingly strong 8-3 
record going into the matchup, were 
immediately swamped by a vicious 

within the first 10 minutes of play 
thanks in part to lhe Slugs' pitifully 
ineffective defense. 

Sophomore defender Malt 
Chilton, who recorded ~ first hat 
trick of his UCSD career, booted a 
missle shot to teammate Brian 
Tumer from the midfield. The ball

U' a VIrUS Can 
Beat Joe ... Tritons Picture of Perfection 

It's Joe vs. the Bolt come ' 
Sunday in an early season battle 

MIZUNO INVITE: UCSD women's volleyball team didn't drop a single set en route to the tournament title 
for supremacy in the AFC West. 
The Chargers carry an astonishing 
4-0 record into the game and have 
begun to tum some heads, but 
need that big win to convince 
people that they're for real. Joe 
fans beware: that win may very 
well come at your expense. 

Joe Montana 's the greatest 
quarterback of all time, a living 
god by almost anyone 's standards. 
He wears four Super Bowl 
championship rings and was 
named Super Bowl MVP three 
times. Now in his 16th season at 
the ripe old age of 37, he's still 
one of the NFL's top quarter-
backs. But even gods must 
sometimes adorn that woeful 
mortal coil of defeat. In week 
four, Joe's then-undefeated Chiefs 
were shut out .by the lowly Los 
Angeles Lambs. Sure, Montana 
had a cold, but I know of a 
quarterback who wouldn 't have 
let a measly cold shut him down. 

Stan Humphries got infected 
by a 300-pound virus wearing a 
black and silver uniform in the 
fourth quarter that Sunday as the 
Chargers took on the Raiders. 
That hit in the backfield resulted 
in what looked like a serious -
possibly season-ending - knee 
injury as Humphries crumpled to 
the ground. His errant pass, 
meanwhile, landed in enemy 
hands and eventually wound up in

This weekend, the UCSD 
women's volleyball team returned 
home for the first time ali season, 

putting on an 
impressive 
show for the 
fans who 
came out to 
enjoy the ac-

rr_-4-.... ....,' tion at the 
annual UC 
San Diego 
Mizuno Invi-
tational. The 
Tritons 
dominated, 
to say the 

least, as they dispatched all of their 
four opponents in straight sets en 
route to the title. 

UCSD's opening contest of the 
tournament pitted it against sorely 
overmatched Fontbonne College 
of Missouri. The Tritons were in 
control from the outset, smashing 
Fontbonne in the first game by a 
15-1 tally. UCSD then went to the 
bench in an effort to spread as 
much experience amongst the 
team's youthful core as possible. 
The Tritons' entire roster saw ac-
tion in two games of the match as 
UCSD cruised to the win. 

out to a 12-2 advantage before re-
laxing a bit. Christine Chi ensured 
there would be no miracle come-
back, however, when she pounded a 
stray pass by the Bulldogs to give 
UCSD the opening game win, IS-5. 

Game two started off sloppily for 
the Tritons who struggled to a four-
all tie early in the game. UCSD then 
found their offensive rhythm, and 
Redlands quickly lost control of the 
game and the match. The Tritons 
won game two 15-4, scoring 11 con-
secutive points and closed out the 
match by taking the third game 15-
3. 

"Redlands was a good game to 
get out of the way," Head Coach 
Doug Dannevik said. "It was the first 
game that we played in front of a 
Friday-night crowd, and we played 
really well to get the win." 

The Tritons' attack was led by 
eventual tournament MVP Julie 
Harvey, who racked up nine kills in 
the contest and amassed a .667 hit-
ting percentage in her two games of 
action. Outside hitters Angelle Cro-
chet and Madelyn Ripken, who pow-
ered UCSD's offense throughout the 
two-day event, each pounded home 
six kjlls against the Bulldogs. Cro-
chet also led the Tritons' with six 
digs in just two games. 

the Raider end zone. The Charg-
ers trailed for the first time all 
day. 

Games two and three also went" 
into the books with relative ease, 
15-5 and 15-4 respectively, in the 
Tritons' convincing home debut. 

UCSD's second matchup of 
the tournament was against 
Redlands University on Friday 
evening. The Bulldogs were hop-
ing that a big upset of the Tritons

UCSD's opening match on Sat-
urday was against the seventh-
ranked Tigers of Trinity University. 
Although the final score wu yet 
another straight-set win for the Tri-
tons, the match wu clearly the hard-
est fought of UCSD's four victories 
on the weekend. Two minutes later Humphries 

limped off the field, too bold to let

of making the NCAA field come

work. No one thought he would 
be I}ack on the field this game, but 
the damnedest thing happened. As 1994 MIZUNO INVITATIONAL 
the inexperienced back-up OB 
prepared to run out onto the field, 
Stan held him back arid limped 
out himself to lead his stuttering 
offense into Raider territory. 
Those dastardly Raiders must 
have sensed blood, and I feared 
for the life of this wounded 
mincemeat-to-be. I had to admire 
his courage - especially as poor, 
old Joe was probably wrapped up 
by nothing more imposing than an 
intimidatingly warm blanket by 
thjs time - but courage often 
makes a fool on the football field . 
Linebackers don't care much for 
courage, but they know a 
wounded quarterback when they 
see one. Wounded quarterbacks 
usually can't scramble, reducing
