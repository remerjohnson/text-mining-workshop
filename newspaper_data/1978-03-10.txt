Muir post sparks fee hassle 

Chancellor McElroy is 
expected to release a letter 
today that requests UCSD 
Business Manager Laura 
Michetti to prepare a detailed 
investigation for the possibility 
of bidding out the campus day 
care operation to an outside 
private agency . the Triton 
Times has learned. by Andy Schneider 

Associate News Editor 
This commenlary is the second 
in a series of articles on the 
Muir Activities Office. Its 
central theme is drawn from 
student input and reaction to 
the Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs (Reg 
Fee). The next piece will focus 
upon the administration's 
position. 

A standing' room only crowd 
was disappointed when the 
Reg Fee Committee postponed 
until next week a decision to 
fund the Muir Activities 
Coordinator. 

Commentary 
The position had been called 

into question when Acting Vice-
chancellor Howard Hunt failed 
to include the item in the 
Student Affairs budget for next 
year. 

A move for immedia te 
. consideration by Muir Reg Fee 
Rep Carroll Wills was defeated 
without a second. He pointed 
out that "if we- defer action, 
these students will not be 
around to ~fend themselves 
when we (the committee) 
really discuss the issue." 

Other members of the 
committee felt that their 
decision had to be postponed 
until they bear "the full 
package of Dean's Office. 
requests" and consider the 
item within the full context. 

Testimony was taken, but the 
position was not discussed by 
the committee. AS Representa-
tive for Muir College Gary 
Moser led the presentation . 
" We are very disappointed in 
the Vice-chancellor for the lack 
of goal setting and objectives in 
the progamming area . The 
Vice-chancellor has never 
talked with any !\1uir students 
prior to his recommendation. " 
he said. 

~ 

His statement prepares the 
way for a substantial alteration 
in the center's organization, but 
the letter does ensure continued 
day care service. Michetti was 
directed to contact several 
different agencies prior to April 
20 . 

Over the last seven years the 
Day Care Center had been 
staffed by University employ-
ees who would be replaced 
under McElroy's proposal. The 
center has provided slots for 32 
children at a cost of $88 ,000. 

The service has been plagued 
by financial difficulty since the 
end of the last school year when 
the campus Fee Committee 
voted to withdraw their annual 
$11 ,000 subsidy. United Way 
also discontinued an $8 ,500 
support contribution. 

Me.ben of the Muir CoUege co ... maaity crowded the 
Although not the final 

decision, the plan to find an 
outside agency that would 
come to the campus and use the 
facilities ttl provide day care

Nancy Hoover and Richard 

Roe were the winners in 
Tuesday's Del Mar elections, 
which also saw residents 
approve two of four proposed 
methods for increasing the 
amount of low- and moderate-
cost housing in the city. 

Hoover, who won a second 
term on the Del Mar City 
Council, captured the most 
votes among four council 
candidates. She took 966 votes, 
while Roe took 826. The two 
losing candidates were incum-

mitted to the Chancellor by the 
Day Care Options Ad Hoc 
Committee. 

Michetti explained that " 80 to 
90 percent in a day care budget 
is salary . With an outside 
agency it looks like operating 
costs would be reduced . 

" What we have now is an 
ideal model program which we 
highly value, but unfortunately 
it requires large subsidy no 
longer available." She recog-
nized that " if we take this road 
we' re changing to a program 
that meets basic staff, educa-
tion and nutritional require-
ments at a reasol}able self-
supporting fee ." 

While the parents pay $1 ,800, 
it costs $2,774 to educate each 
child. Up until the end of this 
year the Chancellor provided 51 
percent of the subsidy. 

His office staff indicated that 
" This campus is having trouble 
getting money from the state. 
Even contract and grant funds 
are tightening up. Undergra-
duate and graduate programs 
take priority for any available 
discretionary funds ." 

In a meeting last week with 
the Day Care Options Ad Hoc 
Committee , the Chancellor 
stated , " Three years ago , 
UCSD made a commitment to 
day care. We intend to honor 
that commitment." 

In addition to the plan under 
study by Michetti , the Chancel-
lor's Office reaffirmed that 
" The door remains open to 
other long term options such as 
exploring with the city 
education departme'nt the 
possibility of building a "pre-
school on or adjacent to 
University property, as a part 
of Doyle Elementary School 
soon to be constructed. 

Michetti indicated that, " The 
benefits of reasonable rates to 
parents with adequate care 
must be weighed against the 
negative affect caused by lower 
salaries paid by private 
agencies. " 

Serena Layon, a day care 
parent who sat on the Ad Hoc 
Committee stressed, " Because 
the wages are so attrociously 
low in the programs the 
committee looked at, it does not 
attract professionals with 
training. They don' t stay in 
those jobs very long," she 

The meeting drew one of the

gents to be assembled by

members were tied together by

AS approves election 
code, spring budgets 

by Eric Jaye 
Staff Writer , 

Codes to monitor the upcoming Spring elections which includelJ 
monitary restrictions on candidates running on slates, were 
approved by the AS Council Wednesday night. 

Originally authored by Elections Commissioner Lori Dority, the 
codes approved by the council included many recommendations 
from a special committee comprised of AS members who pledged 
that they would not be candidates this spring. 

AS spring budget allocations on pg. 12 
Given much debate but finally approved by the council was the 

item restricting candidates' pooling their financial resources. A 
Single candidate will be allowed to spend $50 during the campaign, 
while two candidates running together wil be allowed a total of $75 
and three candidates $100 with an extra $25 added for each 
additional candidate. 

Also approved by the Counctl Wednesday night was the $9,164 
spring budget for student organizations and additional allocations 
for campus media. 

Included in the media aHocallons were $1500 for the new black 
students oriented newspa~r Th~ PropIe', V Glee and $1,050 for the 
conservative journal the Free Trtaon.

Ronald Buman, a buyer for 
the UCSD physics depart-
ment, was arrested Monday 
on the charge of misappro-
priation of public funds . 

The action resulted from an 
investigation of both the 
campus police and the district 
attorney's office, which 
revealed what was termed "a 
billing of the department for 
the amount of $10,567 in 
fictitious purchases." 

BUlJ'lan, 37, is currently free 
on bail of $2500, and was 
unable to be reached for 
comment. 

UCSD Detective Murray 
Penhollow, with a warrant 
issued by Municipal Court 

Judge Robert J . Cooney, was 
the arre.tinl officer of 
Buman. 

Penhollow said the action 
came as a result of an 
"internal audit", with the 

investigation starting at 
" about the first of November 
(,1977) ." . 

Though Penhollow couldn't 
comment on the case because 
of the impending courtroom 
hearing, he did say that "to 
my knowledge no other such 
investigations are currently 
going on. " 

Bogus firm 
Authorities were initially 

alerted to the case by Robert 
Farnsworth, a development 
manager for the UCSD 
physics department, who last 
October as a project manager 
for a research group asked 
business office personnel to 
prepare a detailed list of 
goods purchased for the 
project. Appearing on the list 
was a firm by the name of 
Dave Linville Associates - a 
company Farnsworth bad 
both never dealt with nor 
heard of. 

A subsequent investigation 
by the fraud unit consequently 

accused Buman of setting up a 
fictitious company under the 
name of Dave Linville 
Associates of Beverly Hills. 

Law officials said that the 
university had sent out 62 
checks to the Dave Linville 
Associates between May 1974 
and June 1977. The alleged 
fraudulent bills the university 
paid for ranged in price from 
$43 to $181. 

Various members of the 
physics department, when 
reached for comment, refused 
to make a statement on the 
incident. It was not deter-
mined how long Buman had 
been working for the school, 
nor was it disclosed what the 
nature of the project was in 
which Bruman was arrested 
for "fictitious bUlings." 

At the present time "trial 
maners are be III I set," 
according to Assistant 
District At orney William H. 
Kennedy.

revenue alone. 

Yet the sports industry goes 
practically ungove rned today. 
Most fran chises don ' t even 
release their budgets for public 
inspection. As player salaries 
rise in all sports, owners pass 
their costs directly to con-

hikes. But how can anyone

FANS can help to find tbe

sports as it is to toothpaste. 
Television commentators and 
advertising wizards are adroit 
at making any sporting event 
look good, from a basketball 
game between two perennial 
losers to a boxing match 
between t wo pun c h drunk

The notion of " take it or leave

concerned is patently wrong. It 
is the same as television 
ex-ecutives saying, " If you don 't 
like what's on TV, you don' t

improve TV, and sports, so that 
viewers and fans will get a 
better deal? 

FANS can help make sure 
sports fans get a fair shake 
from the major sports. Owners 
have the right to make a profit. 
But they , as big business 
executives , don ' t have an 
unfettered right to operate in 
total budgetary secrecy, any 
more than does'General Motors

Pacific News Service 
The publishing industry 's 

trade magazine Publisher's 
Weekly is hardly the place one 
would expect to find the official 
aMouncement of one of the 
biggest events in human 
history. Yet the Feb. 13, 1978 
issue of PW contained a full· 
page adverti.sement for an 
upcoming book under the 
astounding headline , " A 
Human Baby Created in the 
Laboratory is Now 14 Months 
Old." 

According to the ad, the book, 
In His Image: The Clonlnl of a 
Man, by prize-winning science 
writer David Rorvik, would 
detail the first successful 
attempt at asexual human 
production . As the J . P . 
Lippincott Co.'s adve:tism.e~t 
said , "Some people WIll hall. It 
as a miracle ; others WIll 
denounce it as s acril egious 
tampering with a natural , even 
holy, process. But there is no 
doubt that by June everyone 
will be talking about it ." 

If Rorvik 's story was true, 
genetic engineers had made an 
enormous breakthrough . A 
human being had literally been 
manufactured out of the single 
cell of one man. The child has 
no " mother" in the biological 
sense. In fact, when it is grown 
to adulthood, it will appear to be 
a "carbon copy" - in every 
physical sense, right down to its 
fingertips - of the man whose 
cell was artifically " tricked" 
into developing into an 
identical person. And if true, 
the door bad been .opened to the 
possibility of cloning not just 
one duplicate of a person, but 
literally millions of identical 
copies. 

Once, of course , all of this 
could be dismissed as science 
fiction. But no more. A number 
of years ago , scientists 
developed a cloning technique 
that could asexually reproduce 
many copies of a frog. There 
have been reports of a type of 
cloning performed with mice 
and rabbits . ' Some of the 
nations top.scientists, including 
Nobel Laureate Joshua Leder· 
berg of Stanford University and 
James Watson of Harvard , had

Historica lly (from the catalogue 
descriptions) , " Third College is 
committed to the ... (s tudy 00 the 
quality of iife ... with an emphasis 
upon developing count ri es a nd 
minorities within the bOunda ries of 
the United States ... to provide a 
Third World perspective on affa irs 
and problems of the Third World 
and its relationship to the West. " 

In the Feb. 6 TT. Dean Bev Varga 
was quoted as saying that as a 
nam e. "she's ' lea ning towa rd s 
Third ' because of tbe meaning it 
has ta ken on for those persons who 
have been at Thi/:d College since its 
inception. There is more strength 
in being together than in being 
apa rt. That' s what Third is all 
about. " Also in the sa me issue, 
Provos t J oe Wats on was also 
quoted , ''' It is importa nt tha t the 
name reflect the history of the 
college .' He felt tha t the name 
should repre ent a place where 
criti ca l analysis of issues occurs 
and where service to the disad-
vantaged is emph asised." 

The names Frede ri ck Douglass 
and Ma rtin Luther King do not quite 
represent the all-round philosophy 
0.1 eve n t he old na me " Third 
College ." which is the preferred 

choice of most persons ra ndomly 
polled. However, the addition of the 
sma ll word "World " into the center 
o f t he o ld na m e wou ld very 
succinctly give it the added impact 
of t he c oll e ge ' s purpose a nd 
i d eo logy . rat he r t h an being 
mistakenly though t of as merely 
the third college to be created on the 
Sa n Diego campus. This minor 
change would al 0 c reate very few 
of the administrative and ini tial 
p.r . confusion problems of a radica l 
name transference. 

Hopefully, the bla nk on the ballot 
will be used to ex press this most 
a ppropriate name c hoice and 
dis p lay t he level of stude n t 
awarenes of our ideology and the 
so lid arity of our purpose . The 
victory of a write-in vote over the 
ba llot choice would a lso display 
the resu lts of collective concerted 
effort over the prevailing odds, 
wh ich again is what Third is all 
about. This would show that those of 
us at Third are indeed a com-
munity , not merely a list of enro lled 
students . 

Flyers and ban ners will be 
appearing this week to further 
elabora te on this issue.

Speculative fiction, from 
Huxley's Brave New World to 
Ira Levin's current best-selling 
novel , The Boys from Brazil, 
have used cloning as the 
centerpiece for their own 
horrorific stories. But perhaps 
the most telling forecast of all 
comes from Dr. James Bonner, 
a leading biologist at the 
California Institute of Techno-
logy . Several years ago, in a 
paper published by the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space 
Administration , 'Bonner wrote 
of the potential for human 
cloning: 

Indeed, if Rorvik 's account is 
proven true, we have already 
started . And in any case, the 
future potential for cloning and 
the artificial creation of life 
already challenges our entire 
value system.

P Ii Sci major stars in "The Balcony" 

last was Michael Addison, director of "The 
Balcony" and chairman of the Drama 
Department. 

by Neal MeadelloU 
Th~'S no buaiDelllike sbow busineu, like no 

bust II I know. Take my word for it, I've been 
wat,~ inl tbe proces •. Tbe product of tbis 
proc$, "Tbe Balcony" by Genet, directed by 
Michael Addison, will be showing at the UCSD 
Tbefltre, March 10-12, 14-19 at 1:00 each night. 

I'm a political science major.l also play two 
parts in the comilll drama production of "The 
Balcony." It's an odd combination, and, at 
times, when I'm not looking, they conflict. But I 
wouldn't live up either one. In fact one can even 
supplement the other. During the day I wrack 
my brain pondering political process. At night I 
open up, relax and enjoy myself. It gets me 
readv for tomorrow's DOli. sci. 

Sometimes I wonder why I ended up he re. I've 
never been in a play . I've never auditioned 
one. I've never n " acting class" !

"The Baleoay." 
night last quarter, I had a few beers and said 
that I'd like to get into a play . I said this to a 
friend who happened to be a drama major. A few 
days later I was auditioning, sober. 

I stood under a spotlight, script in hand . 
Ac ross the room sat three frighten ing , 
professional looking people. One was Arthur 
Wagner, director of " The Hostage." The second 
was Eric Christmas , someone who I had 
admired from afar as an incredible actor, and 
director oC'::"The Caucasian Chal~ Circle." The 

I !lesitated to speak. "My name is Neal 
Mendelsohn and I'm going to read from the 
Caucasian Chalk Circle." Immediately, that 
backof the mind process began; I didn't say my 
name clearly, they can tell I don't know what 
I'm doing. My legs began to shake. I began to 
read. My voice rang out, firm. Firm in doing 
everything I didn't want it to do. I got a part. 
Incredible. 

These past two months I've been working on 
" The Balcony." It' s taught mea great deal , both 
good and bad. From 'the first I felt intimidated 
by the professionalism . Everyone seemed so 
good at it. Most of the people were graduate 
students, from 22 to 26. Over the weeks, through 
rehearsals and fooling around in the dressing 
room, I think I've grown to love them. They're 
all incredible . It's not just the talent, it' s the 
openness. It's opened me up. From rehearsing 
on the Matthews tennis courts to strip poker in 
the dressing room, it's been an experien<;e, 

When these people are up, they're smokin! 
And everyone goes up with them . It ' s 
contagious, this enthusiasm is. There's a lot to 
laugh at and a lot to admire. They~re all teachers 
to me in a way. After rehearsal, I walk back to 
my dorm about 10 feet off the ground, 
sometimes singing (in the dressing room we' ve 
done . a few musicals) . I hope they all get 
success. In ways that I'm beginning to 
appreciate, I think they already have. 

It's surely an opportunity just to see it happen . 
The coming about of a production. Starting with 
a fascinating and classic play, "The Balcony", 
it began. Rehearsals , researching parts, taking 
notes - there 's a lot of work involved . The work 
pays off. Suddenly, you ' re surrounded by 
technicians . Lights go on , music plays , 
costumes a ppear. It' s a miracle the way these 
people fit it together. 

I must devote something to the director, Mike 
Addison . It 's my opinion, and everyone else in 
the production , that they like to work with Mike, 
even when he contradicts himself. I've come to 
appreciate his role. He doesn' t star in the play , 
but he plays every part, He 's everywhere -
encouraging, acknowledging and providing, 
He 's a valuable resource without whom the play 
couldn't happen. Not to mention, especially 
relevant to myself, he has patience. Aside from 
my lack of theatrical experience, he's watched 
me drop (staJte) props across the stage and add 
switchblades and guns, unannounced , into 
scenes. Proof of patience is that I'm still in the 
show. 

The show itself is overwhelming. It 's funny, 
tragic, pomographic ... lts life and the rush for 
the brass ring . I don 't think I've ever known a 
play so personally. And I don' t doubt' for a 
moment, how much anyone can appreciate this 
play . or course , I have a bias . And if I have 
accomplished the purpose of this article, you' ll 
share it with me and come see " The Balcony"; 
the brothel invention of Jean Genet.

What Do You Want From Live? - The Tubes (A&M) 
Something that doel!ln ' t sound empty and dependent on the " you had 

be there" rationale, in answerto the question. The Tubes have a 
stage act that is more visual than musical, and thus the music here 
refuses to stand up for itself , The music at best sounds like old Neil Hefl 
television themes. The boys would have been better off if they ha 
waited for video discs to saturate the mass market. D. T.B.

Through no fault of their own, Caldera is being plugged as the 'U"'\.:"~

jazzy solos, but their ambitions are Jtreater than Carlo' s . The rh ' 
are snappier~ there are more chord changes , and the orientatlt 
wards group Improvisation is greater. But in all Caldera doesn' t CL 
very well. Guitarist Jorge Strunz hilS none of Ca~los Santana 's st 
con$istency , and the synthesizer work by Eduardo Del Ba rrio is \ 
reminiscent of the Electric Prunes than Chick Corea . Calde r

tbe amendment requests, 
said Bret Hewitt. co-director of 
the UC Student Lobby. 
If palled, tbe bill would 

amend the Rumford Fai.r 
Housin, Act to include, as 
illegal. discrimination in 
housin, against students along 
with race, color, religion, sex, 
marital status, national origin 
and ancestry. 

Credl& cbecks 
The amendment concerning 

credit checks would require 
that a section be written into the 
Rumford Act in effect saying 
that the act would in no way 
prohibit cred!t checks so long 
as they were done- in a non-
discriminatory manner, said 
Hewitt. The second amend-
ment WOUld, according to 
Hewitt, say that year-long 
leases aren't prohibited by the 
act. 

The CHC is an organization 
representing the two to three 
hundred largest rental com-
panies in California. 

Rick Yanes, administrative 
aid to Berman, said Berman 
had been approached by the 
CHC previous to Monday 's 
committee meeting, but had 
decided to reject the amend-
ment requests. However, after 
Behr introduced the amend-
ments Berman •. agreed to try 
and amend the bill ," 

Yanes said that some organ-
izations that had previously 
supported the bill, such ,as the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored 
People, the American Civil 
Liberties Union and the Urban 
League, may be unhappy with 
the inclusion of the two 
amendments. Berman is going 
to find out how they will react to 
the amendments and then 
decide on the amendments, 
said Yanes.

Commentary ... 
(C.dJlaM from pale 1) 
their interAction and auociation with the Activities Office. 
Providing supportive documentation representatives-were 
included from the college council; interns, house advisors, Page 
One, Cloud's Rest Commuter Group, campus-wide 
representatives and orientation leaders, 

Their presentations variedbut their focus hit home on the same 
central issue. "It is a dire necessity for college life that the position 
be continued," they said. " Muir's basic concept is breadth , 
decision-making and flexibility .. This philosophy draws a large 
participation, The position affects over 2000 students directly." 

Some staggering statistics were presented by the House 
Advisors. Muir has a student body 50 percent larger than either 
Warren or Third. The ratio of students tostaHin the Muirdormsi 
500 to one while at Third it's only ISO to one. The ratio os students to 
staff at Muir is triple that of Warren or Third. 

HA Chuck Flores stressed that 70 percent of this year's 
freshman class will transfer and leave UCSD by the time 
graduation rolls around four years from now. " It aggrevates us to 
see our school losing its finest resource - the students ." 

Bill Silva added that, " Losing the coordinator would be 
detrimental to a good college social life, 

$4,000 in a budget the size of Reg Fee's is neglible when you 
consider cost effectiveness in the activities provided for students. 
We can't do it alone, we need help. " 

Moser summed up with a challenge to the administration, "I 
would ask the Vice-chancellor to set priorities which enhance th 
social atmosphere. Instead of extra secretaries or a $25,000 
discretionary fund , more money should be used for 
programming," he said. 

Responding to the students, Vice-chancellor Hunt stated, "I 
concur 100 percent. I think we need more programming in all th 
colleges . I did not cut the position. I did not in~lude it becaus 
documentation was not in hand when it was time to make my 
recommendations ." Afterwards when asked by the Triton Time 
if he would support ttie position now because he has th 
documentation, Hunt said, " I'll consider it. " 

Marsha Harris, Student Reg Fee Co-chair thanked the student 
for their input. The student group left the room and continued to 
talk outside while the committee deliberated inside. At th 
expense of classes and jobs, many Muir students turned out to 
contribute to a decision-making process which did not take place. 
Their discussion was about organization and bringing a larger 
student crowd next time as a visible show of support. 

Ironically, the next action taken by the committee was to 
unanimously concur on a recommendation to establish a $25,000 
discretionary fund for the Vice-chancellor. AS Rep to Reg Fee Lisa 
Endlich commented, " I don't know how to tell the student group 
from Muir - you can' t have $4,000 for the coordinator, when th 
Vice-chancellor can have such a discretionary fund ." 

The Activities Coordinator position hangs in doubt one more 
week.
