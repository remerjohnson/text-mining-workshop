A sharp increase in on-campus 
drug- and alcohol-related arrests was 
reported last year, according to cam-
pus crime statistics released last week, 
primarily due to a rise in the num-
ber of arrests and citations of nonstu-
dent attendees at the 2007 Sun God 
Festival.  

The UCSD Police Department 
cited in its annual Clery Report that  
76 drug- and narcotic-related arrests 
and 100 alcohol-related arrests were 
made in 2007, more than double the 
34 drug-related and 36 alcohol-related 
arrests made in 2006.  

The number of disciplinary refer-
rals given out by campus authorities 
and the UCPD also rose from 131 
drug-related referrals and 1,382 alco-
hol-related referrals in 2006 to 152 
drug-related referrals and 1,591 alco-
hol-related referrals in 2007.

Police Chief Orville King attributed 
these increases to on-campus events 
held in 2007, namely the Sun God 
Festival, where 176 arrests and cita-
tions were made. However, about 70 
percent of these were issued against 
UCSD nonaffiliates.  

“A number of factors may pro-
vide insight into increases or decreases 

in alcohol- and drug-related arrests 
on campus,” King said. “Arrests alone 
do not necessarily mean alcohol- [or] 
drug-related activity has gone up or 
down. Increases or decreases in drug- 
and alcohol-related arrests might also 
have a relationship to many factors. 
Examples include how many events 
are held on campus and the nature of 
those events, student population and 
the level of enforcement provided.”

However, because the Clery Report 
— required to be released each October 
by all universities participating in fed-
eral financial-aid programs — lists 
crime statistics from the past calendar 
year, the increase was addressed in 
2008 by A.S. Programming officials 
— responsible for planning the Sun 
God Festival — and the UCPD. 

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garret Berg noted two 
main causes for the spike in arrests and 
citations at the 2007 festival: the disput-
able ratio of attendees to undercover 
police officers and the unaccounted-
for indiscretions of UCSD nonaffili-
ates, who were arrested and cited by 
police officers and thus included in the 
Clery Report.

In response to 2007’s inflated fig-
ures, A.S. Programming implemented 
a number of new safety procedures at 
last year’s festival, following administra-
tive guidelines and festival-operation 
feedback outlined in the 22-page Sun 
God Planning Report. Programmers 
partnered with the University Events 
Office to gather input from other cam-
pus departments, including the UCPD

The University of California will 
adjust its budget to support the ris-
ing cost of employee health care 
under a new plan for the 2009-10 
fiscal year unveiled by university 
officials last week.

Designed to protect UC employ-
ees from rising health-care costs 
through a special, one-time subsidy, 
the plan will employ a continu-
ation of the current salary-scaled 
approach in hopes of preventing an 
increase in employee out-of-pocket 
fees.  

“We recognize how important 
good health-care benefits are for 
our employees and their families, 
especially our lower-paid employees 
who are hit hardest by escalating 
health care costs, and we continue 
to work very hard to ensure they 
have access to quality health ben-
efits,” UC President Mark G. Yudof 
said.

He added that under the plan, 
the university would take on addi-
tional costs in an effort to minimize 
the burden on lower-paid employ-
ees.

“In addition to continuing to 
pay the majority of employee health 
insurance premium costs, as further 
protection for our employees we are 
also defraying a portion of employ-
ees’ increased share, which cuts in 
half the percentage increases our 
lower-paid employees would other-
wise see for Health Net, our largest 
medical plan,” he said.  

One of the most notable aspects 
of the plan, according to university 
officials, is that it will be utilized 
during a time of economic hardship 
when many employers are attempt-
ing to control rising costs by reduc-
ing or eliminating medical and den-
tal benefits. Studies have suggested 
that 2009 employee monthly premi-
ums will increase by 8 percent to 10 
percent, while costs are expected to 
rise 8.9 percent.

The university will continue to 
pay an average of 87.5 percent of 
employee monthly premium costs. 
As for the roughly 42,000 UC 
employees earning $46,000 or less, 
the university will continue to cover 
93-percent to 96-percent of their 
monthly medical premiums.

A team of UCSD professors met 
in downtown San Diego Tuesday to 
discuss current obstacles and trends 
in regional and national politics, 
focusing particularly on the impact 
of the presidential election on San 
Diego and the greater California 
region.

The group of four political scien-
tists and one historian reported that 
the role of Latinos and blacks in the 
U.S. political system is growing as 
San Diego County and California 
drift toward an increasingly liberal 
political future.

The fastest growing ethnic 
group in the U.S., Latinos make 
up 15 percent of the population 
and are becoming a major force 
in national politics, assistant pro-

fessor of political science Marisa 
Abrajano said. 

“Unlike African Americans who 
are strongly part of the Democratic 
Party, Latinos are traditionally 
Democrats only 60 to 40 percent 
[of the time], and George Bush cap-
tured 40 percent of the [Latino] vote 
in the past — the only Republican 
candidate to do so,” Abrajano said. 
“For these reasons, every time the 
presidential election comes, a lot of 
attention is given to Latinos.”

Particularly due to the locations 
in which they are most highly con-
centrated, Latinos have the power 
to deliver decisive swing states, 
Abrajano said, including Colorado, 
Nevada and Florida and New 
Mexico.

“The key to translating this 
electoral size into power is actu-
ally getting Latinos to turn out 
on Election Day,” Abrajano said. 
“That is something they have been 
nefarious at, because many Latinos 
are first-time voters, meaning the 
parties don’t think of them as likely 
voters.”

Female voters, according to 
Abrajano, are also more active than 

usual due to the presence of can-
didates Hillary Clinton and Sarah 
Palin, but are more likely to base 
their vote on issues such as the econ-
omy and national security rather 
than a gender preference.

The trend of minority empow-
erment continues with blacks, too, 
assistant professor of political sci-

ence Zolton Hajnal said. Compared 
to the 1990s, blacks are much more 
likely to hold public office or advance 
politically.

“One of the biggest question[s] 
surrounding this election is, ‘Is 
America ready for a black presi-

UCSD researchers crossed 
one more possible treatment for 
Alzheimer’s disease off their list this 
week in an ongoing quest for new 
tools to combat the mental illness 
that has confounded neurologists 
and drug companies for decades.

The 18-month study found that 
high doses of vitamin B supplements 
did not reduce the rate of men-
tal decline among patients. Patients 
who took a placebo experienced a 
roughly equal rate of decline.

Scientists have observed protein 
“tangles,” harmful plaque and unusu-
ally high levels of a particular amino 
acid in the brains of Alzheimer’s 
patients, but they still have not deter-
mined whether these conditions are 
causes or symptoms of the disorder.

Roberto Velasquez of the San 
Diego and Imperial Counties chap-
ter of the Alzheimer’s Association 
said the latest study reaffirms the 
disease’s complexity.

“There are a number of theories 
as to the cause of the disease, but 
nobody really knows for sure,” he 

said.
The four drugs that have been 

approved in the United States to 
treat Alzheimer’s stimulate healthy 
brain cells to enhance memory, but 
their therapeutic effects generally 
fade within 18 months. 

Paul Aisen, director of the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center 
at UCSD and a lead investigator for 
the study, said researchers had con-
sidered vitamin B as a treatment 
because of its affordability and ability 
to reduce levels of the amino acid 
homocysteine in the brain.

Of the study’s 409 participants, 
60 percent received high doses of 
vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folic 
acid, another form of vitamin B. 
The other 40 percent received pla-
cebos.

Although patients taking the sup-
plements did experience a decline in 
homocysteine levels, their scores on 
metal-skills tests were comparable to 
those of placebo patients.

In addition, symptoms of depres-
sion were more common among 
patients who took the supplements.

“I do not believe that people 
should take high-dose B vitamins 
to treat Alzheimer’s,” Aisen said. 

“People believe that they should pur-
sue any plausible treatment. This 
study demonstrates that, in the case 
of high-dose B vitamins, the risk out-
weighs the benefit.”

The San Diego Supercomputer 
Center at UCSD announced plans 
Oct. 14 for a new facility called the 
Triton Resource to house a massive 
data analysis and storage system.

According to SDSC officials, the 
new cyber infrastructure is intended 
to advance innovation, collaboration 

and discovery at SDSC.
A planning committee comprised 

primarily of UC researchers is still 
brainstorming ways to integrate the 
facility’s major elements into campus 
laboratories and utilize UCSD’s 10-
gigabit research network.

“UC San Diego is building 21st-
century campus research infra-
structure to accelerate 21st-century 
research and education,” SDSC 
Director Fran Berman said. “The 
Triton Resource is a unique environ-
ment that will facilitate our ability to 
make sense of the tsunami of data 
available to us, and drive solutions 
of the most challenging problems in 
science and society.”

— which voiced concern over the 
abundance of alcohol present at the 
2007 festival.  

Programming officials continued to 
work closely with the UCPD through-
out the festival-planning process to pre-
vent a repeat of the trends observed in 
2007. In accordance with the requests 
of these officials, the UCPD agreed 
to reduce the number of undercover 
police officers patrolling the event. 

The event itself was planned with 
stronger community ideals in an 
attempt to unify and strengthen the 
campus community and promote a 
safe, contained environment for stu-

dents.
As an apparent result, drug and 

alcohol incidents declined at the 2008 
Sun God Festival, which will, accord-
ing to King, “likely support an overall 
decline in arrests for 2008,” depending 
on the number of arrests made during 
the remainder of the year.  

However, Berg said, despite the 
overall decrease in the number of 
arrests and citations in 2008 due to 
the decrease in nonaffiliate arrests, the 
number of student arrests and citations 
increased. A.S. Programming plans 
to release its annual report contain-
ing specific data regarding last year’s 
arrests  within the next few weeks 

at the Sun God Student Forum. The 
increase in student arrests and cita-
tions will also be addressed as plans 
for the 2009 festival gain momentum.

The UCPD will maintain its watch 
over alcohol- and drug-related inci-
dents to ensure campus and student 
well-being.  

“The police department con-
tinues to be vigilant in monitoring 
alcohol and drug activity and looks 
for better and more efficient meth-
ods of addressing campus safety,” 
King said.

dent?’” Hajnal said.
One promising sign, according 

to Hajnal, is the presence of 10,000 
elected black officials throughout 
the country, a result of the change 
in national perspective following the 
introduction of black leadership in 
America. After the initial election 
of black mayors and governors, the 
political landscape did not undergo 
any dramatic change, which in turn 
lessened white fears of blacks in 
leadership positions.

However, Hajnal added that 
while minority influence has grown, 
this does not necessarily translate 
into potential for electoral victory, 
and political inclinations may still 
be swayed by a greater Republican 
influence in the short term.

“San Diego has been trend-
ing Democratic,” said Steven Erie, 
professor of political science and 
director of UCSD’s urban studies 
program. “There’s a Democratic plu-
rality in the city, but this is contested 
terrain. San Diego is the last kind of 
Republican anchor project on the 
West Coast.”

San Diego Republicans have out-
organized and outspent Democrats 
in recent years, Erie said, contrib-
uting to what he predicts will be 
a Republican mayoral victory and 
an evenly split city council, despite 
a growing number of Democratic 
voters. 

Similarly, California as a whole 
has undergone a Democratic trans-
formation over the last decade.

“We’ve gone from a state divided 
along north-south lines to one divid-
ed along east-west lines with a more 
Democratic coast and conservative 
suburbs,” professor Thad Kousser 
said. “We’ve moved from a state that 
was reliably red, part of the Reagan 
and George H.W. coalition, to one 
that is so blue that the major parties 
haven’t even contested us in presi-
dential campaigns.”

Naomi Oreskes, professor of his-
tory and science studies and provost 
of Sixth College, commented on the 
state of environmental policy in the 
changing political landscape, claim-
ing that climate-change initiatives 
are not receiving the attention they 
deserve. 

“We see the gap between the 
time-scale of dramatic issues devel-
oped and the timescale of the atten-
tion span of politicians and constitu-
ents,” Oreskes said.

While studies show that 62 per-
cent of Americans believe that life 
as they know it will continue only if 
drastic environmental action takes 
place, Oreskes said, environmental 
issues are continually drowned out 
by the war in Iraq and the current 
economic crisis. 

“This indicates that the parties 
are taking little interest nationally 
and [environmental policy] has not 
even been discussed, even in the 
primaries when candidates differed 
greatly over the issue,” Oreskes 
said.

Oreskes also said that the 
entrenched policies of the Bush 
administration reflect a continuing 
divide between Republicans and 
Democrats over energy and envi-
ronmental policy that began in the 
1990s.

Erie: Republicans Still Likely to Take S.D. Mayorship
▶ POLITICS, from page 1

Money was on everyone’s mind at last night’s A.S.  Council meeting, which 
opened with the introduction of 
another add-on to the proposed A.S. 
Activity Fee Referendum that would 
help sustain programming at the Loft 
in Price Center East by University 
Events Office Director Martin 
Wollesen.

The proposal calls for an addi-
tional $2 per student per quarter to be 
tacked onto the referendum to pro-
vide funding that is necessary for pro-
gramming at the Loft after its tempo-
rary funding runs 
out at the end of 
this quarter. The 
funds that the 
fee would supply 
would primarily 
go toward paying 
the artists’ per-
formance fees.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Gary R. Ratcliffe 
explained that while the space for the 
$3-million Loft was purchased with 
available resources, there were unfor-
tunately no resources to permanently 
support the operation of the venue as 
a nightclub.

“We really took advantage of an 
opportunity that was important for the 
campus in creating a much stronger 
university community,” Wollensen said. 
“Our goal is to create this presence and 
prominence at a national level.”

Wollesen pointed out the unique-
ness of the Loft as a restaurant and 
performance-space nightclub, stating 
that there is no other place quite like 
it in San Diego or at any other uni-
versity campus.  He added that the 
Loft could provide students with great 
experiences for little to no cost, on the 
condition that the referendum passes.

Trailing Wollesen’s special presen-
tation, Associate Vice President of 

Programming Garrett Berg present-
ed the council with a draft of the 2008 
Sun God Festival report and quickly 
rattled off the points of the festival 
that need refining.

He assured that A.S. Programming 
would be working diligently to amend 
the many problems that plagued last 
year’s festival, including the avail-
ability of campus shuttles the day 
of the festival and the limited num-
ber of wristbands that had caused 
such uproar among the student body.  
He was also particularly determined 
to do away with barring re-entry to 

RIMAC Field by a 
certain time.  

He told 
council that the 
P r o g r a m m i n g 
Office would 
start planning the 
logistics of this 
year’s Sun God 

Festival as soon as the final draft of 
the report is finished.

During oral reports, A.S. President 
Donna Bean successfully motioned 
to table voting on the A.S. Activity 
Fee Referendum until next week to 
allow for more time for A.S. council-
members to discuss it with the college 
councils this week. 

Berg publicized the Bear Garden 
that is taking place this Friday, which 
is one of the first events to kick off the 
university’s first-ever Homecoming 
Weekend.

Revisions to the A.S. Executive 
Budget rolled around, and council-
members picked apart the proposed 
changes and recommended minor 
changes to the wording of various 
line items. Discussion snagged when 
Vice President of External Affairs Lisa 
Chen’s motion to have members of 
her staff receive increased weekly sti-
pends was called into question. The 
motion failed after a lengthy dispute.

Police Chief: 2008 Arrest Rate Reflects Heightened Security

THURSDAY OCTOBER 16, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  7

Many of the university’s exist-
ing benefits packages — including 
programs for employee wellness, 
behavioral health and preventive 
care — are also maintained in the 
2009 plan. Employee dental and 
vision benefits will continue to be 
completely covered by the UC sys-
tem. Additionally, employee co-pays 
and deductibles will not increase 
in 2009, and lower-paid employees 
will continue to pay lower monthly 
premiums than other UC employees 
due to the university’s sliding, sal-
ary-based approach to health care.

University officials claim that 
roughly 36,000 UC employees cov-
ered by university medical plans 
will see a decrease in their 2009 
net monthly rates from those of the 
previous year. As a prime example 
of the decreased rates of lower-paid 
employees, officials cite the 2009 
UC Kaiser plan, which awards those 
earning under $46,000 a 6.8-percent 
reduction for single coverage, and 
a 17.9-percent decrease for family 
coverage. The special one-time sub-
sidy is a major contributing factor to 
this rate decrease.   

The effects of the new plan on 

the university, however, will be 
costly. UC officials expect to pay 
approximately $972 million in total 
premium costs — an 8.9-percent 
increase from 2008 — with $967 
million going to employee health 
benefits and $5 million to the spe-
cial one-time subsidy.

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said the 
new plan is primarily concerned 
with maintaining adequate health 
benefits for university employees. 

“The plan is designed to protect 
employees, particularly lower-paid 
employees,” he said.

Schwartz stressed that the 2009 
plan takes into consideration the 
importance of ensuring continued 
employee access to quality health 
care. One of the most important 
features of the plan, he said, is that 
it does not reduce any current ben-
efits. 

He added that the salary-based 
approach and special subsidy will, 
in some cases, significantly reduce 
the potential for cost increases in 
2009.

Dear Editor,
I am not much of a baseball fan, 

but I have enjoyed the “Peanuts & 
Crackerjacks” column in the sports sec-
tion. And for the first time I am some-
what interested in the progress of the 
playoffs. I still have no idea what any of 
the stats mean, but I think I’m getting a 
general idea of what’s going on.

I think a similar approach should 
be taken to the world’s, and my per-
sonal, all-time favorite sport: football. I 
am not referring to the Monday night 
variety (a sport which, in my humble 
opinion, hardly deserves the name). 
No, I am talking about the sport that 
is known throughout the world, except 
for some reason in this country, as 
the beautiful game: soccer. With the 
many NFL fans on this campus, I real-
ize that what I am writing amounts to 
blasphemy. And yet, it is not the NBA 
World Championships or the MLB 
World Series that the majority of this 
planet’s population means when they 
talk about the world title. Soccer is the 
number one youth sport in the country 
and, to bring it closer to home, is cur-
rently one of the most successful sports 
on this campus. Tritons are constantly 
lamenting the fact that no football 
team exists but I beg to differ. We’ve got 
a great one that deserves our support. I 

applaud the Guardian’s coverage of our 
UCSD matches but I think one way to 
arouse more interest from the student 
body (a tough task for anyone, I know) 
is to take a similar approach to the one 
that has succeeded in getting someone 
like me to read about baseball.

Why not a regular soccer col-
umn in the Guardian? I may not fully 
understand the ins and outs of baseball 
or football but I completely under-
stand the great passion and excitement 
that rooting for your team evokes (go 
Arsenal FC!). What better way for 
students to open up to the world than 
through sport? Maybe some of that 
spirit will carry over to our fellow 
Tritons out on the pitch.

Dear Editor,
The deadline for California resi-

dents to register to vote (or change their 
address) for the Nov. 4 presidential elec-
tion is Monday, Oct. 20.

Completed voter registration forms 
must be delivered to your county reg-
istrar of voters or the secretary of state’s 
office by Oct. 20, or postmarked by Oct. 
20. California residents 18 and older (or 
who turn 18 by Nov. 4) who are U.S. 
citizens can register to vote. Forms are 

available at many locations on or near 
your campus as well as in post offices, 
DMV offices, libraries, county elections 
offices, other government buildings and 
some local fire stations (forms have 
prepaid postage). If you have moved 
or changed your name, you must fill 
out a new form and re-register to vote. 
College students can register to vote 
using their college residence address.

If you are not sure if you are regis-
tered to vote, call your county registrar 
of voters. If you do not receive your 
official “voter information guide” by 
Oct. 20, it’s a good idea to call to make 
sure your county elections office shows 
that you are registered to vote at your 
current address. If in doubt — register 
to vote. Additional information on reg-
istering to vote and the voting process 
can be found at the secretary of state’s 
Web site: www.ss.ca.gov/elections.

Dear Editor,
I have always regarded the Guardian 

as a well-run and well-written news-
paper. Succinct and to-the-point news 
columns, entertaining movie reviews, 
heated opinions and the occasionally 
confusing comic strip have all become 
a joy to read between classes. However, 

during class there is a certain section 
of the newspaper that is near and dear 
to my heart and, I’m sure, to many 
other students at UCSD: sudoku. 
Accompanied by his friend and relative, 
the crossword puzzle, these two mind 
games have carried me through lectures 
for more than two years. Unfortunately, 
the first few editions of the Guardian 
this year have started off on shaky 
ground. First week, there was no puzzle, 
which was devastating to say the least. 
The following Thursday edition came 
out guns blazing with two level-four 
puzzles, far too difficult to solve in one 
class. This week was no better, featuring 
two level-one ones, much too easy to 
fill a full class period. I hope these rare 
mishaps are merely a symptom of the 
beginning of the school year. On behalf 
of those of us who depend on these 
precious puzzles to survive, I hope an 
adjustment can be made.

Apparently the 2007 Sun God Festival was kind of a fiasco. The number of drug- and 
alcohol-related arrests shot up at a stag-
gering rate, roughly 100 attendees had 
their stomachs pumped and T.I. totally 
got the name of our school wrong. 

In response to these startling reve-
lations, last year the A.S. Programming 
Office enacted a dramatic overhaul of 
the festival’s traditional format. The 
freewheeling, no-boundaries, all-cam-
pus love fest that students had come 
to regard as a thing of legend was 
abruptly replaced with a fenced-in, 
safety-first shell of its former self. They 
even turned off the fountain.

Worthy of praise from Fischer Price, 
Tyco and the makers of sandboxes 
everywhere, the 2008 Sun God Festival 
was essentially a child-proofed reincar-
nation of its former glory. This tenden-
cy toward an overly cautious approach 
to “fun” is of course typical of university 
officials everywhere, who have a clear 
obligation to protect students. 

However, the extremes to which 
festival organizers took their safety 
crusade served only to undermine the 
tenets upon which this beautiful event 
was founded. Sun God is meant to be 
a day when students break free of their 
academically oriented UCSD arche-
types and exercise the type of debauch-
ery typically reserved for schools that 

actually have football teams. 
As the Sun God Student Forum 

approaches, festival organizers should 
seriously reconsider the event’s format. 
Although safety must indeed remain 
foremost, it is entirely possible to reach 
a balanced compromise that allows for 
student freedom, campus mobility and 
a preservation of traditional Sun God 
values while still preventing people 
from drinking themselves to death. 
Simply herding everyone into a con-
tained area is taking the easy way out.

Sun God existed in its traditional 
form for nearly 25 years without any 
problems on the scale of the event’s 
2007 arrest spree, and 70 percent of 
those arrested that year were nonaf-
filiates. So why completely overhaul, 
and in the process totally destroy, a 
beloved campus tradition just because 
it got a little out of hand one year? As 
the old legal adage goes, hard cases 
make bad laws. A.S. Programming 
must realize that the exception should 
never define the rule. 

When Mark G. Yudof left the dusty state of Texas for the presidency of the presti-
gious 10-campus UC system earlier 
this year, he brought along a one-word 
philosophy oft-flaunted in attempts at 
reformed governance: change.

Specifically, Yudof promised steps 
to increase transparency following 
his predecessor’s boggling of a mul-
timillion-dollar scandal involving 
improperly reported, unapproved pay 
raises for UC higher-ups, a debacle 
that embarrassed the UC Board of 
Regents, angered students weighed 

down by ever-increasing tuition costs 
and caused a massive public outcry for 
more systemwide accountability.

While far from being a panacea for 
the university’s numerous bureaucratic, 
financial and institutional woes, Yudof 
made a significant dent in delivering on 
his promise at last month’s regents meet-
ing by releasing a comprehensive report 
that presents 102 measures of univer-
sity performance and operations in an 
attempt to restore public confidence.

Much of the information detailed 
in the report was already available for 
review, but this condensed version is a 

refreshing move away from the univer-
sity’s typical modus operandi. Jargony 
rhetoric decorated with complex charts 
and tables has been replaced by a 
coherent, clearly designed format that 
not only compares UC campuses to 
each other but also to other public and 
private institutions in areas as diverse 
as graduation rates and affordability 
to research competitiveness and even 
progress in seismic structural retrofit-
ting projects. Though useful, necessary 
and long overdue, the information pre-
sented, however, is not accountability 
— it’s merely public documentation. 

Now, the report has entered the 
comment phase, giving the public a 
four-month time frame to respond to 
the information’s structure and rel-
evance. Californians must heed this 
time to push UCOP to use the data 
trends presented by the report to out-
line solutions to the nagging issue hov-
ering around UC administrators: How 
exactly does the university develop and 
implement efficient planning, budget-
ing and performance strategies? It is 
only when this question is finally effec-
tively answered by the university that 
accountability will be achieved.

UCOP Report Hints at Accountability, but It’s Not Here Yet

New Sun God Should Be a Thing of  the Past

BEN HOLM/GUARDIAN

EDITORIALS

Exactly one year and two months from now, I’m slated to graduate early from UCSD, 
in the shortest period that I could 
possibly have finished my laundry 
list of Eleanor Roosevelt College 
general-education requirements. 
People rarely understand why I’m 
so impatient to leave California’s 
crown jewel of sunshine and sandy 
shores. “But college is the best four 
years of your life!” they say. 

Maybe for some. As for me, I’ve 
had more than enough of my zero-
practicality communication classes. 
I’m tired of riding the shuttle to 
and from and around our exhaust-

ingly huge campus. I’m through 
with the socially sluggish week-
ends. A couple quarters in, and I 
just wanted to get the hell out. My 
greatest joy on this campus was 
Cafe V. carrot cake, and the last 
seven times I checked, they don’t 
even sell it anymore. 

I had it all figured out: Complete 
several internships by the start 
of my senior year. Informational 
interview like there was no tomor-
row. Secure some solid freelanc-
ing gigs. Apply for open positions 
during the summer months. I was 
determined that by December 2009, 
I would not be “that college gradu-
ate” — you know, the one whose 
descent from the commencement 
stage is accompanied by the realiza-
tion that she has no solidified plans 
for the future? That she’ll likely be 
living under her mother’s roof pay-
ing $200-per-month “rent” as she 
fulfills the roles of alarm clock, chef 
and housekeeper?

Yeah, not me. 
On my road map of postcol-

legiate life, I had the brilliantly 
unique notion that I’d move to New 
York City, official breeding ground 
for us pretentious writer types, who 
consider ourselves original in our 
rejection of corporate America and 
the status quo. Sure, my sodium 
intake would be off the nutritional-
facts charts from all that ramen, 
but at least I’d have the seedlings 
of a career in place, and after a few 
years, I’d be financially OK. I had 
a game plan for making it in the 
magazine world, and it was going 
swimmingly well. 

Of course, that’s before the 
economy started to unravel. Before 
already weak ad sales plummeted 
further. Before — nobody lose it 
now — CosmoGIRL! magazine 
folded last week.

I was devastated. In many ways, 
CosmoGIRL! is everything that my 
future profession stands for. Some 
little girls obsessively plan their 
wedding day and imagine walking 
down the aisle. I obsessively laid 
out my career and envisioned my 
very own “Devil Wears Prada” life-
style. (I know, I know. I’m a walk-
ing cliche.) 

Don’t get me wrong — certain-
ly, “What Your Handwriting Says

About You” quizzes and Q&A ses-
sions with the Jonas Brothers do not 
hard journalism make. It’s not the 
loss of Cosmopolitan’s little sister in 
particular that I mourn. The demise 
of that once top-selling publication 
that made a monthly appearance 
through my tween years prefaces 
the demise of something bigger and 
better: print media. 

The setbacks the print industry 
has been experiencing are ones that 
even Brangelina offspring and the 
most jaw-dropping Heidi Montag 
cover lines can’t salvage. Big names 
have folded right and left: Jane, 
Quick & Simple, Elle Girl, Teen 
People. Just last week, the New York 
Times laid its Metro section to rest.

While reporters have been noto-
riously underpaid throughout histo-
ry, there has, at the very least, been 
a consistent need for writers who, 
for lack of better words, know their 
shit. We’ve always needed report-
ers who will dig unflinchingly for 
a story, advocate the consistency 
of AP style and demonstrate their 
allegiance to the inverted pyramid. 
As print media heads obediently 
to the graveyard, however, many 
of those standards — and the jobs 
they call for — follow suit. 

The point is — in the current 
state of things, my prospects of 
becoming a magazine journalist 
are looking pretty slim. Call me 
naive, but in my mind, graduating 
with a degree from a top univer-
sity once translated into job secu-
rity and a livable income. Far too 
quickly, that one-time safeguarded 
bridge between academia and the 
professional world has begun to 
fall apart. (Whatever happened to 
quality assurance?)

In a most prominent example, 

one of my magazine-intern friends 
graduated with a journalism degree 
from Pace University this past June. 
Despite being located in New York 
City, the media capital, and having 
back-to-back internships through-
out her four years in school, she just 
isn’t faring well in the real world. 
As she wrote on my Facebook wall 
yesterday: “With the market this 
year, no one is really hiring me. I 
have the experience of an intern but 
can’t even get an internship because 
I’m not eligible for college credit. I 
work at Red Mango in the mean. It’s 
a Korean frozen yogurt place.”

I didn’t know whether to laugh, 
cry or hide in a hole hoping the 
industry would experience an 
upturn. (Then again, I suppose if 
one must be poor, one ought to 
be poor with access to unlimited 
frozen yogurt.)

For these past few months, I’d 
reasoned that there was in fact no 
reason to prolong my undergradu-
ate studies once I’d finished my 
required classes. I’d been all too 
ready to dive into the deep end, to 
toss the course readers and WebCT 
printouts aside and to search for 
my professional niche in the big 
city. But suddenly, even a date 14 
months away seems a little too 
close for comfort. 

There’s no guarantee that the 
market will look any different after 
a few more quarters — but why 
expedite my educational studies? 
Perhaps there’s nothing wrong with 
taking my time here to rediscover a 
couple more months as Unemployed 
Student before attempting to take 
on Trailblazing Careerist full-time. 
As I wade around in the shallow 
San Diego waters, I start to think: 
Maybe the kiddie pool isn’t so bad 
after all.

Red Admissions Tape Finally Gets a Trim Job Prospects Look Grim, but 
at Least There’s Frozen Yogurt

▶ LINES, from page 4

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — The transi-
tion from high school to college is 
almost wholly defined by its red 
tape — and those who wish to don 
the all-important university sweat-
shirt need only, in the end, to be 
equipped with the smarts (or guid-
ance) to find their way through a 
dizzying series of arbitrary bureau-
cratic hoops. Standardized tests 
have more to do with memorization 
of specific question-and-answer 
types than a general academic abil-

ity; high-school education paths are 
more often shaped around univer-
sity “a-g” college-prep requirements 
and Advanced Placement opportu-
nities than personal interest; schol-
arship applications are more a test 
of endurance, technical-jargon deci-
phering skills and capacity to keep 
from strangling your head-scratch-
ing parental assistant — most likely 
even more lost than you are, and 
for hours on end — than a gauge of 
good old-fashioned financial need.

Apparently the entire bureau-
cracy behind this fundamentally 
ridiculous system stood in front of 

some giant mirror of truth under 
harsh fluorescents and finally 
understood what nitpicky assholes 
they all looked like. Seemingly at 
once, every last stiff restriction is 
being proposed a thoughtful soft-
ening in what seems like a grand 
attempt to spread the love, theoreti-
cally widening the pool of eligibles 
to include all those with the smarts 
to succeed in higher education but 
without the same resources to push 
them through the hoops.

It’s almost too good to be true

— a rainbow-sailed ship from the 
land of everything good. The SAT 
has been evaluated by the National 
Association for College Admission 
Counseling as a faulty measure of 
academic potential and as favoring 
those with the resources to prepare 
for it, prompting many universities 
(including Harvard) to consider cut-
ting it from the admission process. 
Similarly, the UC Board of Regents 
is discussing the complete oblit-
eration of SAT II subject tests from 
the laundry list of UC application 
requirements, along with opening 
a new margin of consideration for 
those missing a couple “a-g” require-
ments and a new GPA lenience for 
those without honors weight to 
boost their numbers. And lastly, 
once students have been accepted, 
U.S. Education Secretary Margaret 
Spellings has proposed a shrinking 
of the Free Application for Federal  
Student Aid from 100 questions to 
26, a change that would — accord-
ing to surveys citing length and 
complexity as the key deterrences to 
completing the paperwork — give 
a significant amount of additional 
low-income students the chance to 
be considered.

But if these dreams were actu-
ally brought to life — and, for more 
red tape, talks and proposals are 
always a long road from their actual 
implementation — there would be 
nowhere near sufficient room for 
them to reach the proportions they 
propose. Less hoops will result in 
the desired larger pool of applicants, 
more of whom will be eligible for 
financial aid, widening an already 
unmanageable dream-to-budget gap 
through which the entire opera-
tion would collapse. Because unless 
the giant new chunk of consider-
ees is rejected entirely — essen-
tially voiding all purpose for the 
admission-regulation bending — a 
first essential change would need to 
occur from above, an Earth-shat-
tering shift in federal and national 
funding priority. 

Of course, asking for war/oil 
money to be shifted to California 
education is almost laughable at this 
point. Well, who knows — not to 
jinx it, but there is a certain elec-
tion approaching that could make 
all the difference, and hell, if a new 
generation of college-goers is able 
to entirely avoid the sterile prisons 
that are the SAT sittings, maybe 
anything is possible.

T rekking to class late on a Friday afternoon can be disheartening in and of itself, but for students simultaneously missing out on a 
religious holiday inherent to their cultural iden-
tity, the path can be even more problematic. 

Professor Rick Ord, computer-science lec-
turer for seven years — as well as the director 
of the computing facility in the department of 
computer science and engineering from 1988 
to 2001 — has witnessed many of his students’ 
moral conflicts in choosing between class and 
religious celebration.

“More and more students, be they Jewish, 
Muslim, et cetera, have been asking to take 
quizzes early or do labs on a different day 
because of Islamic and Jewish holidays that fell 
on days in early October,” Ord said. 

UCSD does have a contingency policy for 
students requesting alternate test and assign-
ment dates. On the Academic Senate Web site, 
the Committee on Educational Policy stipulates 
that students who anticipate conflicts with final 
exams must submit a written statement no 

later than two weeks into the quarter; for other 
routine testing dates, students must submit a 
letter to the professor as soon as they discover 
the conflict, at which point the professor is 
required to provide an alternative testing option 
if possible.

“All of our instructors make all reasonable 
efforts to accommodate scheduling conflicts 
with any student’s religious schedule,” univer-
sity spokesman Rex Graham said in an e-mail. 
“It is the policy of the university to make rea-
sonable efforts to accommodate students hav-
ing bona fide religious conflicts with scheduled 
examinations by providing a lternative times or 
methods to take such examinations.”

Some students feel the university could be 
more sensitive to lesser-celebrated religious 
holidays.

“I know a lot of people who can’t make it 
to events because they had class or midterms 
that they just couldn’t get out of,” said Revelle 
College sophomore Sukhreet Ghuman, head of 
social events for the Sikh Student Association. “I 
feel like every religious community would want 
the same equitable treatment in terms of profes-
sors observing various religious holidays.”

Accommodating students with legitimate 
reasons to be absent from class is not the only 
issue over which Ord is concerned. After con-
sidering more seriously the widely differing 
backgrounds at UCSD, Ord feels a more com-
plete awareness of these religions and holidays 
is called for. 

While researching the topic online, Ord 
stumbled upon the official religious calendar 
of the University of Indiana, Bloomington. He 
considered a similar option at UCSD.

Ord said he’s not asking that an official 
religious calendar be incorporated into UCSD’s 
existing campus calendar — just that there 
should be some sort of calendar identifying 
the major religious holidays of the world on 
UCSD’s Web site. 

“It would be extremely difficult to get a uni-
versitywide religious calendar supported by all 
departments,” Ord said. “But one for the public, 
students, faculty and administrators just needs 
to be more available.” 

According to the Center for Student 
Involvement, there are 41 registered religious 

New Love for the Old Stuff: A Lesson in National Monuments
W ith the general election loom-ing closer and closer every day, television and newspapers bom-
bard the political circuit with candi-
dates’ opposing principles and policies, 
which all claim one thing: the right 
course. Whether it 
be in the form of 
extensive change 
promised by Sen. 
Barack Obama (D-
Ill.) or the central 
reform touted by 
Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), politi-
cians on the Hill have been asserting 
their capacity to put America back on 
track. But most students of political 
history will tell you that the country is 
always on the wrong path come elec-
tion season, and politicians often forget 
their promises to the American people 
once votes are cast. It’s a never-ending 
cycle of change and turnaround that 
brings petty politics and hollow prom-

ises to every level of government. 
If politicians were smart, they’d 

stop focusing solely on the future and 
pay a bit more attention to the past. 
As McCain would say, “My friends, 
you must look at the records.” In this 

case, the records are 
American history 
101. 

Besides being the 
political center of the 
nation, Washington, 
D.C. boasts an enor-
mous amount of his-
tory that beckons to 

millions of tourists from around the 
globe who want to see how one simple 
act of treason more than 200 years ago 
became the model for the free world. 

As a history enthusiast — one 
who can recite the preamble to the 
Constitution by memory and who 
watched an entire John Adams mini-
series with unusual zeal — I’ve been 
enjoying my opportunity to visit 

Washington, D.C.’s historical sites. I’ve 
been to the National Mall twice, and 
every Tuesday, if I don’t have class 
or work, I wander the Smithsonian 
museums, which are finally free of the 
weekend’s bussed-in tourists. 

While I enjoy touring our colo-
nial history, I try to avoid sites filled 
with fanny-packed tourists, staggering 
through an unfamiliar setting with no 
idea where they’re going, staring at the 
past through a camera lens and clicking 
away in whatever direction their tour 
guide points.  

Even representatives, who rub the 
toe of George Washington’s statue on 
their way into the House chambers 
for luck, can forget the ideologies that 
Americans have trusted them to pro-
tect. Luckily, the words of wisdom and 
warning from the Founding Fathers 
are everywhere: carved into the stone

Imagine a place where you 
could score prizes for sharing old 
finals and midterms — where by 
simply providing your professor’s 
name and the title of your course, 
you could gain access to last 
year’s chemistry or physics final, 
for free. Good news — St. Louis 
University graduate Demir Oral 
has created a Web site that fulfills 
your every finals-week fantasy.

PostYourTest.com, sponsored 
entirely by ads to avoid usage 
fees, brings in over 1,000 reg-
istered users and approximately 
50,000 visitors a month. There are 
over 500 posted tests: some from 
Harvard, Notre Dame and St. 
Louis University, but the majority 
of which come from our very own 
campus. 

As UCSD contributes approxi-
mately 90 percent of this site’s 
posted tests, concern has arisen 
among faculty regarding issues 
such as academic integrity and 
copyright violations. 

Students and professors post 
old exams online in exchange for 
coffee cards, gas cards and elec-
tronics. The site follows a points-
per-post system in which users 
earn two points per test posted, 
which can then be exchanged for 
rewards. Exams can be posted 
anonymously, and individuals do 
not have to be registered users 
in order to view them. However, 
only registered users are able to 
participate in the reward system.

Nearly a year after 
PostYourTest.com’s 
conception, students 
and faculty continue 
to debate issues of 
copyright violation and 
academic morality.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  11

U pon first glance, an unwitting passerby might mistake the dark shapes cutting through the waters of La Jolla Shores 
for lumps of seaweed, but after wading a 
few yards into the chilly ocean, even the 
legally blind quickly come to realize why 
the area has been dubbed Shark City. 

Every year, hundreds of leopard sharks 
make their way down the West Coast in 
search of a warmer climate and breeding 
grounds. Their numbers are the greatest 
in August when the average water tem-
perature reaches its annual high, 68 degrees 
Fahrenheit, making it the peak month for 
sightings.  

Shark City is located at the southernmost 
end of La Jolla Shores. It is by no means a 
secret; masses of kayakers and snorkelers 

congregate in the area, serving 
as a blatant marker to the location of these 
glorified fish. The best launching spots 
for paddled and finned marine enthusiasts 
alike are directly in front of the La Jolla 
Beach and Tennis Club and especially in 
front of the Marine Room Restaurant. 

The sandy flats are more popular with 
the leopard sharks than the nearby caves 
because they prefer to scavenge the shal-
low sea bottom for mollusks, crabs, worms, 
shrimp and fish. With mouths about the 
size of a quarter, the sharks pose no threat 
to humans and actually prefer to swallow 
their small foodstuffs whole. 

While beachgoers need not subscribe 
to Steven Spielberg-induced Hollywood 
exaggerations and gore, it’s not to say that 
swimming with these animals is without 
suspense. One second you’re watching the 
reflection of the sun dance on the sand, and 

the next you’re caught com-
pletely off guard as a four-

foot shark slithers right 
under you. Given that 

the sharks travel in 
loose schools, it’s 

common to see 
upward of a 

dozen com-
ing and 

g o i n g 
in all 

directions, many in less than an arm’s reach. 
Depending on age, they range in size from 
three to seven feet, and their elaborate pat-
terns vary between shades of light brown 
and black. 

There are numerous ways to view 
the sharks. Snorkeling is probably 
the best, though just standing in the 
shallows as they wind around your 
legs offers a rival perspective; wad-
ers beware that sting rays are also 
drawn the warm water, so shuffle-
walking is a must. Kayaks allow 
onlookers to cover more area 
and thus appreciate the num-
ber of sharks from a slight-
ly removed position. Some 
people even scope the scene 
from stand-up paddleboards. 
The best sighting conditions 
from any angle are low tide, 
low surf, bright overhead 
sun, no wind and warm 
water. 

Many shops along 
Avenida de la Playa offer 
equipment rentals and 
guided tours. La Jolla 
Kayak supplies wetsuits, 
masks and fins for $24 per 
day, and kayaks (which the 
company brings to and from the 
beach) for $28 every two hours. They also 
offer combo tours of the caves and Shark 
City that involve equal parts kayaking and 
snorkeling, which run $65 for all the gear, 
a knowledgeable guide and two hours of 
exploring — though guided snorkel tours of 
Shark City are completely unnecessary. 

Students looking for an up-close and 
personal marine experience should defi-
nitely check out this nearby attraction.

12 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2008

Oral, who took a summer phys-
ics course at UCSD, was inspired 
to create the site after taking a 
test his junior year at St. Louis 
University. On his way out, he over-
heard two students discussing an 
old exam they had studied from. 
Oral thought it was unfair that 
only select students were able to 
gain access to these resources, and 
wished the valuable study mate-
rial could have been available to 
everyone. 

“I had to always study hard, and 
I would have appreciated profes-
sors’ previous tests to reference so 
that I could not only get a feel for 
how a professor tests, but also for 
how difficult this class is going to 
be,” Oral wrote on the Web site. 

PostYourTest.com was launched 
in November 2007, but only gained 
its current popularity after a series 
of news reports in June 2008. 

Former UCSD Academic Senate 
chairman and biology professor Jim 
Posakony said he is uneasy about 
students using the site.

“I react [unkindly] to someone 
acquiring a document from other 
than the copyright owner and mak-
ing it public,” Posakony said. “The 
instructors may have no intention 
of making their exams available to 
the public.” 

Amid growing controversy, a 
“banned list” was created on the 
site in which professors could make 
sure their material wasn’t posted. 
Oral said that 20 to 30 percent 
of the request forms for the opt-
out list were submitted incorrectly, 
such as failing to indicate the iden-
tity of the professor. As a result, the 
site is no longer adding instructors’ 
names to the list; however, the site 
continues to honor all previously 
made requests. 

In June, the UCSD Academic 
Senate decided to take a differ-
ent approach. Associate Campus

strung along the walls and corridors 
of the Capitol, the White House, the 
Supreme Court and the Library of 
Congress. Elected officials and see-
all-the-sites-in-a-day vacationers 
would do well to take a tour from 
a capable guide, one who dispels 
the stereotype of tedium and really 
brings the past alive. Mary, the tour 
guide from Philadelphia, can do 
just that. 

When she arrived for our sched-
uled tour in colonial attire, com-
plete with a white lacy bonnet, I 
inwardly groaned. However, she led 
us around the landmarks of the 
old city with ease, pointing out the 
various points of interest with a 
matter-of-fact attitude that made 
me wonder whether she’d been alive 
during the time period she’d just 
discussed. 

“You know, Benjamin Franklin 
was appointed as an ambassa-
dor to France in 1776, where he 
developed a fetish for French 
women,” she said. “But he liked 
the French and eventually reworked 
his approach to European diplo-
matic relations, which later helped 
secure the Treaty of Paris in 1783. 
He showed that it pays to have for-
eign friends.” 

In one go, she told me more 
about a Founding Father’s life, both 
political and marital, than I’d ever 
read about in a history textbook — 
and I retained it. Mary kept history 
fresh, entertaining and relevant. 

In the same way, because our 
country is so young, our history 
is well preserved. There are pre-
served copies of the Declaration 
of Independence, the Bill of Rights 
and our Constitution, the last of 
which looks as though it was signed 
yesterday. That kind of history is 
tangible enough to generate pride 
even from us, the 11th generation 

of Americans since the founding 
of the United States. The time cap-
sule-like preservation makes monu-
ments and documents more than 
just history and grounds them in 
modernity, for better or worse.  

Abraham Lincoln, sitting high 
in his marble chair, may inspire awe 
or a camera-happy reaction, but the 
words carved into the sides of his 
memorial are true to the time and 
lessons of history — a characteristic 
similar to many of our monuments 
and much of our national history 
— that sometimes go unheeded. 

George Washington’s warning 
against unwarranted involvement 
in foreign nations’ affairs in his 
farewell message must have been 
overlooked by President George W. 
Bush when he entered Iraq. James 

Madison wrote about the evils of 
political factions and partisanship 
in dividing the nation to the point 
of inefficacy in legislation, a les-
son that would have been help-
ful to those who failed to foresee 
and properly address the financial 
market crisis until now. The list of 
politicians who should have heeded 
history only grows by the day: Ted 
Stevens should have known about 
the consequences of corruption 
from Thomas Jefferson; Michelle 
Bachman might have learned some-
thing about Americanism from 
John Adams; and as Mary the tour 
guide pointed out, there is some-
thing to be said about sexual discre-
tion, a lesson Tim Mahoney learned 
too late. 

America is a country divided by 

religious, racial, social and economic 
disparities as well as regional bound-
aries. There is one thing that tethers 
us to each other and to this land: the 
preservation of the principles upon 
which our nation was founded. And 
the easiest way to remember this tie 
is to study a little American history, 
to see the monuments, museums 
and memorials and to appreciate 
this country for what it has been and 
what it can become. 

With any luck, the first act of the 
new president-elect on Nov. 5 will 
be to take a tour of the Washington 
they live and work in, carefully tak-
ing note of history to learn a thing 
or two about the right course for 
America. Hopefully, they’ll bring 
more than a fanny-pack and a cam-
era.

groups on campus, in addition to a 
hefty handful of unofficial ones. 

SSA, as one of UCSD’s official 
religious groups, facilitates student 
celebratation of the 300-year-old Sikh 
tradition.

“Any kind of calendar would help 
religious organizations throughout 
UCSD spread the word of their holi-
days and events, as we lack diversity,”  
Thurgood Marshall College senior and 
SSA Director of Events Ruby Bhangoo 
said. “This will allow those who are 
passionate and want to celebrate their 
holidays an opportunity to celebrate 
them and perhaps even put on an 
event on campus.” 

Even many nonreligious students 
agree that the simple act of formally 
recognizing varying religious groups 
will help the campus.

“I consider myself staunchly 
nonreligious,” John Muir College 
junior Michelle Louden said. “[But] 
I think such a calendar would be 
a positive change because Christians 
aren’t the only religious group here 
in the U.S. and within UCSD. We are 
a very diverse group of people and 
Christianity shouldn’t be the only reli-
gion to have its holidays respected.”

The University of Southern 
California’s Web site has a religious 
calendar, as does UCLA’s. The ques-
tion professors like Ord and religious 
minorities are asking is: Why not 
UCSD? 

“The world is changing,” Ord said. 
“I grew up in the Midwest, where every-
one had names like Bob, Tim, Jane and 
Mary. People just need to be a little bit 
more aware of other students’ religious 
practices these days. It will make us a 
more united group of people.”

Louden said she wouldn’t feel left 
out if accommodations were made 
for other students of various belief 
systems. 

“Religion isn’t something we can 
really argue with,” Louden said. “It’s very 
personal. If religious students feel they 
need to have time off to observe holi-
days while I’m in class, they’re just going 
to have to work harder to keep up.”

Ghuman said she hopes her pro-

fessors will consider making an excep-
tion for events like Diwali, the Festival 
of Lights — celebrated by Hindus, 
Sikhs and Jains — which falls on Nov. 
3. During the festival, SSA will light 
up Library Walk with candles starting 
at 6 p.m.

While Ord sympathizes with stu-
dents who want a religious calendar and 
policies respecting religious respites, he 
adds that it’s even more important from 
a faculty perspective. 

“Some type of available calendar 
could make it so teachers are aware 
of ongoing religious events and don’t 
have to rearrange their schedules when 
it hits at the last minute,” he said. 

According to Graham, the six-
college system — while a continual 
strength of UCSD — also contributes 
to the difficulty of keeping students 
centralized and up to date on events. 
He said another problem with form-
ing such a calendar, even just online, 
would be the risk of leaving out reli-
gious groups who may not be repre-
sented substantially at UCSD but still 
want recognition. 

Some have concerns about poten-
tial abuse of an updated calender.

“You’re always going to have those 
people who try to take advantage of 
the system and don’t act with integrity 
on things like this,” said Earl Warren 
College freshman Alexa-Rae Navarro. 
“Generally, when I look at the UCSD 
population, I get the vibe of people 
who really want to be here and are 
focused on their studies. Even if the 
option was given to miss class or a test, 
I feel the majority would completely 
disregard it. I know I wouldn’t want 
to give up an important day of class 
because I know could be getting that 
much farther ahead.” 

Calendar or no calendar, respect-
ing others in a rapidly expanding, 
diverse society seems to lie at the heart 
of the issue.

As Ord put it: “If you have the 
opportunity to make allowances for 
a student with a legitimate religious 
excuse, why not?”

MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  15

Counsel Daniel Park contacted 
Oral asking if the university could 
submit a blanket opt-out list in 
which professors wishing to ban 
their tests from the site could fill 
out customized forms, collectively 
gathered and sent to PostYourTest.
com. Oral consented, and approxi-
mately 170 UCSD professors added 
their names to the banned list. 

Despite questions of academic 
morality, Oral defends the use of 
old tests as a valuable study guide 
and resource for students.

“Sharing old exams is a study 
method, not cheating,” Oral said. 
“It gives an outline of what profes-
sors can ask. Professors can also 
use this site to improve their old 
curriculum in such a way that stu-
dents can have an understanding 
of how that professor is going to 
administer the exam, as well as set 
up a better exam.”

Student opinion of the contro-
versy surrounding the site gener-
ally falls on Oral’s side.

“It’s not considered cheating 
because the tests that you’re look-
ing at are not the same ones you’re 
going to be receiving,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore 
Nathalia Torres said. “It serves as a 
good study guide because it gives a 
good outlook on what the professor 
expects you to know.” 

Posakony, who was involved 
in the UCSD Academic Senate’s 
response to the Web site, said it was 
important for the senate not to take 
sides, but to instead respond to the 
site in a neutral manner by inform-
ing the faculty of the situation and 
their options.

“Senate was in a position that 
was careful — we didn’t want to 
presume that all faculty would be 
opposed,” Posakony said. “We felt 
like whatever we did it couldn’t be 
something that shut down the Web 
site; it had to be up to the professor. 
Some faculty felt it was almost their 
duty to give students access to tests 
and answer keys, while others were 
appalled.”

The senate’s opt-out list is no 
longer an option. Instead, if a pro-
fessor wants their material taken 
off the site, they must wait until 
one of their exams is posted and 
then request that the content is 
removed. This request must follow 
the guidelines for completing  the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
takedown request, posted on the 
Web site to alleviate concerns of 
copyright violation.

All professors in the UC sys-
tem legally own the copyright to 
their exams, so Oral faces the pos-
sible accusation that posting this 
material without the consent of the 
copyright owner is, in fact, illegal. 

Oral argued that the site does 
not infringe on copyright laws, 
asserting that all copyrighted mate-
rial is removed when requested, 
in accordance with the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. 
Other Web sites such as YouTube 
also use this act in their regulated 
removal of copyrighted material.

“We do and will honor all prop-
erly submitted opt-out requests,” 
Oral said in an e-mail.

However, whether or not the 
copying and distribution of these 
online exams abide by “fair use” — 
the manner by which copyrighted 
material is allowed to be used with-
out the permission of the owner 

— is still up for debate. 
Posakony said that posting these 

exams does not constitute fair use, 
as it grants access and distribution 
to a larger group of people than was 
intended originally.

“When you post an exam on a 
Web site with free access, then in 
principle, millions of people could 
copy, print and further distribute 
it,” Posakony said. “It is still an 
undecided question as to whether 
or not this particular use of exams 
constitutes fair use or not.”

Posakony added that the debate 
over whether the site violates 
copyright laws could possibly be 
grounds for a future legal suit. 

“If [the Web site] brings a 
ground flow of anger from all the 
UCs, I could imagine legal action 
being taken,” Posakony said. 

However, as of now, UCSD is 
the only UC campus that is signifi-
cantly influenced by the site, and 
reactions vary among faculty and 
students.

“I think there are good things 
about PostYourTest.com,” econom-
ics professor Kate Antonovics said 
in an e-mail. “For years, fraterni-
ties and the like have kept copies 
of old exams from various classes. 
PostYourTest.com just levels the 
playing field; now any student can 
gain access to old exams. What’s 
more, it drives home to instruc-
tors the importance of writing new 
questions each year.”

John Muir College freshman 
Elena Coupal is also on Oral’s side. 

“Obviously they’re not going to 
use the same midterm every time,” 
she said. “I don’t understand what 
the problem is because it would be 
good practice for the students.”

Meanwhile, Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Raymond Robles 
sympathizes with professors that 
are frustrated by the site. 

“I support free exchange of 
information, but I understand how 
this could be really irritating and 
counterproductive for faculty,” 
Robles said. “If they want to cut 
down on academic dishonesty, they 
should change tests.”

Oral plans to make his Web site 
as global as possible. He added 
that an individual from the Arab 
country Oman recently posted an 
exam on the site. Oral also plans to 
expand PostYourTest.com by mak-
ing standardized tests such as the 
MCATs and LSATs accessible for 
free.

“I feel that PostYourTest.com 
will have a large impact on the 
improvement and evolution of 
higher education for both students 
and professors across the world,” 
Oral said in an e-mail. 

Whether it results in students 
gaining access to better study 
guides, professors changing their 
exams on a regular basis or action 
taking place in the courtroom, the 
Web site has undoubtedly made an 
impact.

“We as professors have entered 
a new era in which information 
and documents are so much more 
distributable and accessible than 
they ever were, and we have to take 
this into account,” Posakony said. 
“We have to respond to this one 
way or another, either by adjusting 
practices accordingly or through 
legal action.”

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

F irst, a warning for those expecting a left-ist Bush-bash: “W” is not a satire, a par-ody or anything even mildly exaggerated 
for comedic effect. Oliver Stone’s new biopic 
is actually a sort of political “Walk the Line,” 
packed with hilarious insight into the mind of 
a character so publically reviled that he cannot 
help but become larger than his humanity. 

Josh Brolin plays Dubya in a way that perch-

es us remarkably well between the politician’s 
public and private life; Bush’s simpleminded 
blunders and off-hand foolhardiness are readily 
apparent, but so is the man who grapples with 
public disapproval and overwhelming federal 
decisions beneath his cool exterior. 

More than that, the president’s every-
man charm is as well-pictured as it could be, 
reminding even the most skeptical audience

why so many voters were first captivated by 
him before his inauguration. 

In fact, Brolin is so true to life that most 
characters become mere archetypes in his 
shadow — Thandie Newton’s Condoleeza 
Rice, in particular, is all fawning support 
and gap-toothed smile, Richard Dreyfuss’s 
Dick Cheney pure Machiavellian and Jeffrey 
Wright’s Colin Powell a simple caricature 
struggling with moral responsibility and loy-
alty to the Cabinet. 

But the least convincing character by 
far is Elizabeth Banks’ Laura Bush — partly 
because she doesn’t look a thing like the first 
lady, and partly because her only real involve-
ment in the Bush administration is to meekly 
and prettily encourage her husband during 
his rockier moments. 

Stone’s mental vision of the notorious 
Prez relies heavily on an alleged father-son 
conflict. The film often implies that Bush’s 
deeper motivation in the Iraq War and even 
the presidential campaigns was an attempt to 
move out of (and beyond) his father’s shad-
ow, as well as gain his well-guarded respect 
and admiration. These are all sentiments that 
we can empathize with  — until we notice 
that applying such simplistic explanations for 
Bush’s actions completely neglect the need for 
any real presidential obligation, and doesn’t 
account for the inevitably great moments that 
will fall under any presidency. Still, Stone’s 
hand is so unyielding that “W” feels like 
“Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” gone cyni-
cally wrong; simple, intuitive men who feel 

strongly about stuff aren’t necessarily suited 
for the greater good of the nation. 

In general, the film blends its parts in a 
manner that is decidedly trite: A common 
man is locked in  battle between addiction 
and familial responsibility, who takes on

Jean Grae
■ The Evil Jeanius
BABYGRANDE

E ver since reigning queen of the femcees Lauryn Hill unplugged her flow for a higher calling and Kum-Ba-Yah sensibility, the likewise socially conscious but significantly less angry-at-the-
world Jean Grae has been it — on tour with halfway-underground 
crowd pleasers like Mos Def and Talib Kweli and recording in, 
most recently, the bottomless orchestra/church-choir pit that is 
studio to the concoctions of 9th Wonder (third wheel of Little 
Brother and general edge-giver to rap’s biggest egos). 

Grae and Wonder’s high-energy Jeanius was originally leaked 
in 2004, and didn’t see its deserved release until this September; 
ironically, Babygrande (former Man to the devilish Grae spirit) 
now digs up some stock verses from her 2003-05 stay at the label, 
treats them with a mere two-week production period assigned to 
atmospheric at-home duo Blue Sky Black Death, hastily dubs the 
10-track project The Evil Jeanius and frisbees it out the back door 
with almost zero publicity.

Accordingly, beat interaction with Grae’s chorus and vocal 
embellishment is tighter and more three-dimensional on the 
Wonder collab. But BSBD — accustomed to spreading their 
limbs on dark instrumental albums or scoring bloodthirsty raps 
by horrorcore underground like Wu-Tang outcast Holocaust 

and, just last month, the untamable Gutta — sunny up the sig-
nature thunderstorm to cradle Grae’s subtleties as best they can, 
never letting it be known that she wasn’t right beside the beat 
machine, getting her husky story raps all over their bedroom 
microphone.

In fact, the time and space gap between the cotton-mouthed, 
corn-rowed Cape Town native and her fresh-faced stagehands 
sets in motion a magnetic tension that Wonder’s safely classic 
Jeanius could never have felt. “Dressed in a throwback dress, fit-
ted, throwin’ a line/ From the Patron shot, head spinnin’, sippin’ 
on wine/ I’ve control to the whole club, the scene of the crime,” 
she growls over the tingling mosquito synths and restless cym-
bals of “Even on Your Best Day,” which then breaks into a fit of 
spoken-verse snippets for a tornado of a hook. It’s a new spring-
board versatility for the boys of BSBD, who have historically lost 
us in epic layers of haunted forests and wind chimes, and ulti-
mately a gift to hip-hop’s finest female — whose effortless rants 
take on new relevance in their crumpled, doodled notebook.

High Places
■ High Places
THRILL JOCKEY

H igh Places set off on the trail that Panda Bear blazed last year with the sample-heavy psychedelic pop of Person Pitch, but repackaged in the co-ed framework so successful for dynam-
ic duos like the White Stripes and Mates of State. In this particular 
relationship, Mary Pearson handles the coy vocal anthems and 
Rob Barber works the boards to create surreal pop morsels from 
a pastiche of honed noise. Their self-titled debut expands on the 
3/07-9/07 collection’s electro-twee, built from found sounds and 
doubling as an interpretive-dance soundtrack for a kindergarten 
jamboree.

Here’s the hitch: Pearson crafts every melody as if it were a 
rejected nursery rhyme, rarely measuring up to Barber’s remark-
ably consistent and fully realized ambience. Pearson’s modest pop 
ambition ultimately reins in the jungle celebration of “The Tree 
with the Lights in It” and detracts from crackle-and-bass number 
“A Field Guide,” making herself out to be a high-school girl sing-
ing made-up lyrics over all her favorite records. It’s cute, harmless, 

sometimes annoying and yes, you can be sure the band will be 
name-dropped in stitch circles across the country, because the 
combo of innocuous vox and kitchen-sink electronics sometimes 
falls into place. Witness the ecstatic and bumbling “From Stardust 
to Sentience,” a track founded on the most infectious beat of 2008, 
chattering so cleverly with timbre and tune you can play it on a 
desk with only your hands. “Golden” layers Pearson’s mantras 
over triggered third-world bustle. 

High Places establishes the Brooklynites’ handmade and gentle 
qualities, endearing and irritating all at once, though potentially 
transcendent. Their inspiring debut is day-care music you can 
play before the kids take their afternoon nap; inevitably, it’s also 
the favorite of that whiny kid in your section that you absolutely 
can’t stand.

Gamer’s Remorse: 
Why XBox 360 Isn’t 
Such a Bargain Buy
So I finally succumbed and bought myself an Xbox 360. I had considereed investing in a next-gen system for awhile, and though  exorbitant prices  discouraged me 
from doing so, Microsoft’s recent price drop of the 360 
Arcade version to a mass-market value of $200 convinced 
me to reconsider my investment plans. Seeing as my room-
mate agreed to split the cost of the system, buying the Arcade 
version would’ve 
meant shelling out 
$100 now and 
paying him the 
extra $100 over 
the rest of the 
quarter. 

Not a bad 
deal; but once I 
realized that the 
thing doesn’t even 
come with a hard 
drive (making the system utterly useless), I found myself in 
a bit of a dilemma. I was already determined to buy a con-
sole; either way, I’d have a next-gen system by the end of the 
day. So the question was, which system I was going to buy? I 
had two options: pay $300 for the 360 Pro version (the next 
best model) or pay $400 for the Playstation 3. 

I decided on the Xbox. Only a few days later, I’m suffer-
ing from buyer’s regret. 

Hardware issues aside, I thought I was making the

Brightblack Morning Light & Glasser

THE CASBAH / OCT. 20 / 8:30 P.M. / $12

Welcome, flower children: Come join 
Brightblack Morning Light at the Casbah 
Monday night. Duo Rachael Hughes and 
Nathan Shineywater play hippie lounge 
on their commune in the New Mexico 
backcountry; they even powered their new 
album Motion to Rejoin entirely on solar 
power, ceasing to record once the sun 

went down. Lazy day-baked tracks like 
“Starblanket River Child” and “Hologram 
Buffalo” mosey down a stream of slide 
guitar, blown-out organ and wheezy 
harmonies on a vision quest. Warm-up act 
Glasser builds suspense with minimal Casio 
over a chorus of hand drums, ushering in a 
back-to-the-land revival. (CK)

Sita Sings the Blues
THE LOFT / OCT. 16 / 7 P.M. / FREE

A pastiche slamming vivid shapes and 
textures against 1920s musical jazz, “Sita 
Sings the Blues” reinvents the epic Sanskrit 
tale of Ramayana to deliver modern comedy 
with folkloric roots.

Blending the high- and low-brow, the 
film is tagged as the “greatest break-up 
story ever told.” Certainly, producer-animator-

storyteller Nina Paley’s vision waxes symbolic 
with confectionary flare. Indonesian shadow 
puppets narrate a tragic exile, evil kidnapping 
and one heroic goddess who overcomes it all 
— including flying eyeballs and monsters 
with multiple appendages. It’s not surprising 
that this creative call for justice has won 
worldwide film-fest recognition. (SM)

HIATUS PICKS
THE WEEK’S

BEST BETS

By Sonia Minden
Hiatus Editor

If you wanna get big in Hollywood, you have to play accord-ing to the vulturous codes behind the glossy-haired, white-smiled sheen — cozy up to immoral, nasty and plain ol’ evil 
industry folk (usually Jews) palming all that glitz and glam like 
it were pocket change. We’re familiar with this ugly truth. Yeah, 
the sunset is just two-dimensional particleboard, and the cli-
mactic kiss was shot about two thousand times over. And after 
everything’s cut and pasted, the surplus grime gets swept under 
the red carpet, reserved for supermarket gossip fodder.  

But apparently there’s a gentler version of L.A.’s peck-
ing order, so infamously idolized and feared. In “What Just 
Happened?,” adapted by Art Linson from his memoirs as a film 
producer, Hollywood is less about tabloid theatrics and more 
about cell phone bickering, divorcee struggles and popping 
pills to enhance an otherwise disappointing and unvarying 
tedium. 

While it’s not the first time those bigshots with BlackBerrys 
have poked fun at their own game, director Barry Levinson 
frames the daily complications of a midlife moviemaker in jar-
ring hyperrealism. In the end, we discover that what matters 
isn’t really Bruce Willis’ grizzly-man beard or a stack of test-
screening cards filled out with “fuck yous”— it’s the ability to 
cope with inevitable (and mostly shitty) change. As the endear-
ingly disheveled Ben, Robert De Niro reaches this slow-arching 
realization with the steady restraint of a man slipping from the 
last rungs of the power ladder. 

Ben’s life unfolds upon the first screening of “Fiercely,” his 
latest multimillion-dollar blockbuster and a clear dud, evident 
from the crowd’s yawns and  scuffling fest. But then comes the 
finale: The hero is murdered, his loveable dog leaps across the 
screen, and — to the audience’s utter horror — the bad guys 
murder Fido, too. Breaking a cardinal rule of Hollywood (never 
kill your cutest character), the pooch twitches stiffly, blood-
soaked. Ben sinks into his chair. 

What the hell just happened? Of course, it’s a question fre-
quently overturned.

Ben’s otherwise unordinary life is peppered with this kind of 
controlled humor — never straining too far from the realm of 
truth but always mocking itself and feeding us the archetypal

B rooklyn homes its share of odd musical nooks and boho collectives. Borough-beat group Gang Gang Dance’s fourth record, Saint Dymphna, shellacs their 
sedated tones over the same global hodgepodge that 
M.I.A. has so thrived on and commercialized, Cost Plus-
style. But unlike the worldly Londoner, Gang Gang don’t 
sample regional beats from various third-world cultures; 
instead, they borrow time-tested signatures from Asia and 
Africa with the intention of crafting a version to represent 
themselves as city dwellers in a new century.

Dymphna involves laptop tech-tricks, percussive and 
often processed guitar licks— even smooth, new-age 
pads to present an experimental variation of an ancient 
people whose heritage is unknown. “Bebey” begins the 
spiritual crusade with sparkling chimes and midi gurgles; 
as a mellow tom-tom cadence joins with the precision of a 
full-moon bonfire. Once shrill vocalist Liz Bougatsos  has 
synced herself to the thump of “First Communion,” we 
realize that GGD’s absurd indie-moniker isn’t for cachet; it 
helps to solidify their image as otherworldly genre-bend-
ers who sound as foreign as they are futuristic. 

Concise synth jammer “Vacuum” relies heavily on an 
orchestra of drum pummels that could be tracked to a 
number of old civilizations, but their inclusion of laser-
gun bleeps and tremolo keys eventually grounds the song 
in this decade. “House Jam” briefly pays homage to Enya’s 
use of ethereal voices, but then flips into an aboriginal 
version of Madonna’s techno period.      

Their synthesis of contradictions finds its unfortu-
nate plateau in the pairing of avant-dance with grime 
rap on “Princes,” a potentially huge discovery that ends 
up annoying in its scattered attempt; for now, hip-hop 
and hipster should never mix like this. Neither should a 
blatant social statement like “McDonald’s cashiers in a 
country where cows are sacred” be injected tastelessly into 
a track that had everything else down pat. Then again, 
Saint Dymphna’s folksy plea is like the local anti-hero to 
M.I.A.’s McMusic, reliably tasty but somewhat hollow. The 
world is probably big enough for both gunshot hooks and 
alleyway dance parties.

Jake One
■ White Van Music
RHYMESAYERS

H ow do you pack Keak Da Sneak, Little Brother, Busta Rhymes and Elzhi onto one album and not make it sound like a jumbled mess? Featuring over 
27 artists — major-label and underground alike — Jake 
One’s debut album White Van Music leaves that ques-
tion unanswered. 

The album kicks us off on a “music trip” with first 
track “I’m Coming,” featuring Black Milk and Nottz. 
With haunting background riffs and layer upon layer of 
soundboard-stuffs, ambitous producer Jake One forces 
us through a single-player adventure video game straight 
from the ’90s. Sparingly scattered throughout the album 
are rare tracks that do keep Jake One’s ride going strong, 
particularly those spit on by Freeway, Brother Ali or 
Little Brother. 

But therein lies the problem of White Van Music — 
instead of taking us on a potential sans-drug trip, we take 
a nose-dive into turbulent waves of directionless clamor. 

The self-proclaimed “perfect beat writer” completely 
snubs the flow of the more aggressive guest MCs, forcing 
them to spit over beats that don’t half-match their raw-
ness. Keak Da Sneak snapping over Jake One’s smoothness 
on “Soil Raps” leaves us with the feeling that ’N Sync has 
just sung the vocals for Metallica’s “… And Justice for All” 
— one big, painful trainwreck for all.

The album’s shining moment is on disc two, which 
is tied up with enough instrumentals to lace the entire 
CD. He also announces a contest: the amateur who 
can make the best original song from one of his tracks 
wins a studio session with the Seattle producer him-
self. If you’re an aspiring MC, you should jump on that 
challenge; ’cause knowing Jake One, he’ll find a place 
for you on his next album — whether you fit there or 
not.

Los Campesinos!
■ Saint Dymphna
THE SOCIAL REGISTRY

T he very phrase “Los Campesinos!” epitomizes the irreverence and exuberance of this seven-piece group, hailing despite whatever border-town taco stand the name suggests — from Wales. 
Their sophomoric album We are Beautiful, We are Doomed crams 

together lush layers of strings, horn, heyboard and glockenspeil into just 
10 brief tracks; and while all that noise might suggest absolute sonic chaos, 
a formula soon emerges: vaguely danceable pop beats eternally receding 
into an emotional gripe fest. The bandits wash, rinse and repeat, but rarely 
accelerate into a riotous orgy of Debbie Downer lyrics crossed with para-
doxically exuberant instrumentation. 

For all the bouncy pizazz, the title track ascertains emo bearings in 
the blunt declaration “We kid ourselves, there’s future in the fucking/ 
But there is no fucking future.” Sure, we’ve seen this sort of thing before 
— most notably in the heavier rock-out of Panic! at the Disco — but Los 
Campesinos! (note the similar exclamatory nod) slip in enough innovation 
to escape the trenches of whiny indie-pop redundancy. 

Perhaps it’s the back-and-forth of two distinct vocalists — male gruff 
engaged in lyrical sparring with pleasantly soothing female croaning 
— that soften their songs’ bleak implications, or maybe it’s the novelty of a 
good and true British accent — always exotically attractive. But in any case, 
We are Beautiful, We are Doomed isn’t nearly as dull as its premise would 
suggest, and worthy at least of a cursory listen.

self-imposed orders of ambition in 
order to both stroke his lofty ego 
and satiate a father whose respect 
he never seems to receive. 

The one thread that keeps this 
particular plotline fresh is that 
the protagonist is, well, George W. 
Bush. Far more than an everyman, 
he holds arguably the most power-
ful political position in the world, 
and is, by now, a pretty damn well-
recognized celebrity. 

“W” ends on a despairing note 

while admirably avoiding sides; 
and indeed there is no solid finale, 
because — for better or for worse 
— Bush’s story isn’t over yet. 

While America concerns itself 
with the oncoming November elec-
tion, Stone documents the end of 
an era but shoots the conclusion 
with a darker tone; at this point, 
either Bush or the world must suc-
ceed. 

Afterall, it’s been black vs. white,

best possible decision. In hindsight, 
I realize that I was only thinking 
short-term. The only retail games 
that I want are Mirror’s Edge and the 
new Prince of Persia, both of which 
can be purchased for either system 
within the next few months, and 
my judgment was clouded by the 
prospect of purchasing digital down-
loads Braid and Bionic Commando: 
Rearmed upon setting up my hard-
ware. 

In today’s console war, the bat-
tle for contingency relies on profi-
cient use of online space. Arguably, 
Microsoft’s Xbox Live currently 
dominates the digital arena. By mak-
ing Live an integral part of the user 
interface, Microsoft has ensured 
that the average 
Xbox owner will 
always be con-
nected to the ser-
vice. In fact, the 
ease of switching 
between a game 
and the Live 
Marketplace via 
an in-game cross 
media bar has 
always been one of 
the service’s finer 
points. The addi-
tion of “achieve-
ments” was also nothing short of bril-
liant, tapping into every gamer’s sub-
conscious desire to collect. But what 
else is there really? The experience on 
Xbox Live isn’t getting any better, just 
more efficient. In comparison to Sony’s 
Playstation Network, Microsoft hasn’t 
evolved past its initial state.

PSN is growing. It started with 
the GUI update, and since then, it 
has hit the ground running. Though 
Sony’s announcement of a 10-year plan 
for the system was laughable when it 
debuted, they’ve since taken the nec-
essary steps to ensure that the PS3 
becomes the dominant platform in the 
foreseeable future. 

Unlike Microsoft, Sony is taking 
full advantage of digital distribution. 
By advocating compact gaming experi-
ences, the company has invested in the 
creativity of small-time games, flashing 

titles like flOw and Everyday Shooter 
— both of which have won accolades 
for innovation — at the forefront of 
their marketing campaign. Also, by 
including microgame developers like 
Q-Games (creators of the PixelJunk 
series) as part of their internal devel-
opment team, they’ve assured consis-
tently unique content exclusive to the 
network. 

Judging by its release trend Sony 
is attempting to set the standard for  
online space. That both Warhawk 
and Siren: Blood Curse can be bought 
online for cheaper than retail is a testa-
ment to this notion.

With Insomniac — creators of 
Resistance and Ratchet & Clank and 
exclusive developers for Sony — also 
adopting a similar digital delivery for-

mat, it becomes 
harder to deny 
Sony’s commit-
ment. Having 
Ratchet & Clank: 
Quest for Booty, the 
most recent title, 
specifically tailored 
as a supplement to 
the successful Tools 
of Destruction, 
with a shorter play-
time (about three 
to four hours) and 
a streamlined expe-

rience at $15, it becomes easier to see 
PSN as the most viable purchasing 
method. 

The mere availability of these prod-
ucts speaks volumes: by constantly 
marketing the PS3 with all the services 
of the Playstation Network, Sony is 
making its 10-year plan a reality. With 
the onset of titles such as Fat Princess, 
LittleBigPlanet and Home — all of 
which incorporate the Playstation’s 
online capabilities to various capaci-
ties — the PSN is becoming a valid 
distribution medium, something 
that can’t be said of Microsoft’s Live 
Marketplace. 

While I’m now convinced of Sony’s 
long-term success, I regret that this 
entire thought process took place after 
I purchased my very own Xbox 360. 
Life offers many lessons, and this one 
was a tough pill to swallow.

Head coach John Pascale praised 
his squad’s commitment to a strong 
work ethic despite the rough patch-
es they have encountered this sea-
son.

“It was easy in the beginning of 
the season when everything was 
going great,” he said. “Your true 
colors show when things aren’t 
going well and the guys did a great 
job of responding against Chico.” 

With only four conference 
games left, the win could not have 
come at a better time as the Tritons 
look to build on their newfound 
momentum and finish the season 
strong.

“It was an all-time low after 
losing to [Cal State] Stanislaus,” 
Fernandez said. “We did a lot of 
soul searching after that and came 
out for this match fired up.”

UCSD looked to build upon its 
big win as the Tritons traveled to 
No. 10 Cal State Dominguez Hills 
on Oct. 15. As of press time, scores 
were unavailable. The Tritons will 
return home to battle No. 4 Cal State 
Los Angeles on Oct. 19 and Seattle 
Pacific University on Oct. 25.

After an alumni meet on Oct. 
18, UCSD will start its season with a 
dual meet against Claremont-Mudd-

their first meet around the corner, the 
Tritons’ focus is on improving them-
selves as opposed to worrying about 
their opponents. 

“We have about three weeks of 
pretty tough training,” McGihon 
said. 

The meet will give the Tritons a 
chance to figure out what UCSD’s 
best top-to-bottom lineup is, some-

large number of recruits.

and playing good defense,” Jerkovic 
said. “There were some missed shots 
but for the most part, both teams 
were locked down on defense.”

In the second half, the offenses 
came alive with the game still stay-
ing close. The Tritons and 49ers 
scored two goals apiece in the third 
quarter to tie the game again at 
four. UCSD was able to hold a 4-3 
advantage in the fourth period and 
vault itself into the winner’s bracket 
of the tournament. 

The Tritons’ prize for winning 
the opener was to face No. 2 UCLA, 
the highest-ranked opponent they 
have faced this season. After fall-
ing behind the Bruins 5-2 in the 
first quarter, UCSD held its own 
and tied the score at six at the half. 
UCLA was able to overpower the 
Tritons in the third quarter, how-
ever, outscoring UCSD 4-1 to take 
the game. 

“The UCLA game shows that 
our team can compete with anyone 
on any given day,” Jerkovic said. 
“Most of the guys on the team think 
we could have and should have won 
that game. We have a lot of room 
for improvement, but we’ve come 
a long way since the beginning of 
September.”

UCSD opened up the second 
day of play against its chief rival 
LMU after having lost to the Lions 
once this season. As in the previous 
matchup, the Tritons held the lead 
over the Lions but were unable to 
stop LMU defensively late in the 
fourth quarter. The Lions tied the 
game at 12, sending it into over-
time.

The overtime periods were dom-
inated by the Lions, who outscored 
the Tritons 3-0 to take the 15-12 vic-
tory. UCSD’s overtime loss to LMU 
made its win over UCSB in the final 
game even more important. 

“I think it was huge, especially 
for confidence level,” Jerkovic said. 
“That game [against UCSB] — win 
or lose — wouldn’t have mattered 
that much, but we were exhaust-
ed and worn out and it was cold 
and windy outside … winning that 
game ended the tournament on a 
big positive note.”

The Tritons (13-6 overall) have 
a tough task ahead of them as they 
return home to face Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps on Oct. 17 at 5 p.m. 
UCSD has had trouble holding on 
to games at home, having lost com-
manding leads in its last two con-
tests at Canyonview Pool. 

“We have to stay on the track 
of playing well,” Jerkovic said. “We 
have to play the whole four quarters 
instead of a half or three quarters 
like we have been doing.”

Sudden Death Goal Puts UCSD on Top

TRITONS DIVE INTO ACTION

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE
Junior Daniel Garcia had a total of four goals in four games at the Southern California Tournament.

Sports Editor

WATER POLO — The UCSD men’s 
water polo team shook off a demor-
alizing loss suffered at the hands of 
UC Irvine at home last week with 
a strong showing at the Southern 
California Tournament, held in 
Malibu, Calif. over the weekend. 

“After we lost to UC Irvine, we 
couldn’t afford to make any more 
simple mistakes,” junior two-meter 
Daniel Garcia. “It was a wake-up call 
after that game.”

In a tournament featuring the 
top 10 teams in the nation, No. 7 
UCSD — ranked No. 9 at the start 
of the tournament — won its first 
game against No. 10 Cal State Long 
Beach, putting the Tritons in the 
top eight of the tournament. UCSD 
lost its next two games against No. 2 
UCLA and No. 6 Loyola Marymount 
University before winning in sudden 
death overtime against No. 7 UC 
Santa Barbara to finish the tourna-
ment on a high note.

After a tough overtime loss to 
LMU in the third game of the tourna-
ment, the Tritons had to turn around 
and face UCSB in the seventh-place 
game. The two teams competed in a 
heated battle, tying nine times.

In the fourth quarter, the Gauchos 

pulled out ahead and led by a score 
of 9-7 with 2:23 left in regulation. 
But the Tritons fought back with 
two goals from senior utility A.J. 
Kotanjian. 

“We had the momentum going 
into overtime,” Garcia said. “UC 
Santa Barbara had to play with a 
defensive mindset and we were 
ready to score. It was a little bit of 
an edge.”

The teams played two overtime 
periods but, with the score still tied, 
the game went into sudden death. 
After the first sudden death period 
went by with no scores, the Tritons 
were determined to end the game 

during the fourth overtime.
“We really wanted to win in 

the first possession,” senior driver 
Adnan Jerkovic said. “It had been 
four overtimes and we were in sud-
den death. We won the sprint and 
took a timeout.”

The Tritons came out of the time-
out ready to score on that posses-
sion. According to Jerkovic, UCSD 
designed a play to go to Kotanjian 
but when Jerkovic was fouled out-
side, the play changed.

“I got fouled on top and didn’t 
think I had enough room to pass it 
to A.J.,” Jerkovic said. “I thought I 
could catch the goalie off guard so I 
shot the ball cross cage.”

With the sudden death goal, the 
Tritons placed seventh in the tour-
nament and were able to upset the 
higher-ranked Gauchos.

UCSD was pitted against Cal 
State Long Beach to start the tour-
nament — a team the Tritons had 
beaten once and lost against twice 
already this season. 

“Our number-one goal was to 
beat Long Beach in the first game 
and get ourselves in the top eight,” 
Jerkovic said. “After that, we were 
underdogs for the rest of our games 
so we just tried to upset as many 
people as possible.” 

As important as the win over 
Cal State Long Beach was, it did not 
come easy for UCSD. The teams 
fought hard defensively in the first 
half, ending the half tied at two. 

“It was classic defensive hard-
nosed game, with both teams hustling 

The Tritons hold their 
own against the nation’s 
best, finishing seventh at

Tournament.

SWIVE — With most of last sea-
son’s team returning and a whole 
class of new recruits, the UCSD 
swimming and diving team looks 
primed to contend for the Pacific 
Collegiate Swimming Conference 
Championship. 

“We’re coming into the season 
expecting to win the conference 

championship,” head coach Scott 
McGihon said. 

The Tritons placed second in con-
ference on the men’s side and third on 
the women’s side last season, a year 
after both teams won the conference 
title in the 2006-07 campaign. 

“That’s our number one goal — 
to win conference,” senior captain 
Steve Hardy said. “We have some 
great new members and a positive 
attitude to get back to No. 1 in con-
ference.”

The Tritons are fielding a much 
different team than last season. 

“We didn’t really graduate too 
many people, and we have a rookie 
class of about 20 men and women,” 
McGihon said. “It’s a different 
dynamic than last season. Every 

practice has turned into quite a com-
petition.”

The competition went from prac-
tice to the starting blocks when the 
Tritons split into two teams for the 
annual Blue vs. Gold Meet. While 
the meet does not officially count 
for anything, it allowed a chance for 
certain Tritons to shine in real com-
petition.

On the men’s side, Hardy won 
three events for the Gold team and, 
according to McGihon, was one of 
the standouts, with victories in the 
50-meter backstroke, 150-meter 
backstroke and 300-meter individual 
medley.

MEN’S SOCCER — After nearly 
three weeks without a win, over 400 
minutes without a goal and little 
time left in the season, it would 
have been easy for the UCSD men’s 
soccer team to phone it in against 
a Chico State squad that had not 
lost at home all season. But that is 
exactly what the Tritons refused to 
do as they captured a huge 2-0 vic-
tory against the Wildcats on Oct. 12 
at the University Soccer Complex. 
UCSD got second-half goals from 
senior forward Tom Caplan and 
sophomore forward Jared Kukura 
to earn its first win since defeating 
Cal Poly Pomona 3-0 on Sept. 26 
at home.

The Tritons went into the match 
looking to rebound after a tough 1-
0 road loss to Cal State Stanislaus on 
Oct. 10. Rebound they did, shutting 
out a Chico State side that had out-
scored their California Collegiate 
Athletic Association opponents by 
a margin of 11-1 at home going into 
the match. UCSD finally ended its 
lengthy scoring drought in the 64th 
minute when sophomore defender 
Aaron McDowell blasted a shot 
on net that was initially saved by 
junior Chico goalkeeper Michael 
Keohane before Caplan pounded 
the rebound home for his sec-
ond goal of the season. The early 
lead was huge, and after going so 
long without a goal the squad was 

understandably pleased.
“[The goal] felt great,” senior 

forward Tony Fernandez said. “It 
relieved a lot of pressure.”

It felt so good that the Tritons 
decided to do it again only 11 min-
utes later. Junior midfielder Tony 
Choi laced a free kick into the box, 
where Kukura soared above defend-
ers and knocked a header inside the 
near post. The goal was Kukura’s 
third this season, tying him with 
fellow defender McDowell for the 
team lead. 

After building the two-goal 
lead, the Tritons turned to their 
defense to finish the match, and 
they performed admirably, earning 
senior goalkeeper Peter Akman his 
seventh shutout of the season. The 
win improved the Tritons’ record to 
7-4-2 overall and 4-4-2 in confer-
ence play. UCSD currently sits in 
fourth place in the CCAA South 
Division with 14 points. Cal State 
Los Angeles leads the southern 
pack with 23 points.

The offense was certainly the 
story coming into this match and 
Choi pointed to better fundamen-
tals as one of the reasons for suc-
cess.

“I think it was just a matter of 
execution,” he said. “We were just 
a lot sharper with our passing and 
when we had the opportunity to 
score we put it in the back of the 
net.”

Fernandez said the win was the 
result of the team working together 
on all parts of the pitch.

“The consistency was there — 
from our defense to the midfield 
to the forwards.” Fernandez said. 
“I think this was our best perfor-
mance overall.”

The UCSD swimming and diving team kicked off its season with the Blue vs. Gold Meet on Oct. 11 during which the team split and competed against each other. The Tritons’ 
first official meet will be on Oct. 25 when UCSD hosts Claremont. The team hopes that its recruiting class of 20 athletes will bring it back to the top of conference.
