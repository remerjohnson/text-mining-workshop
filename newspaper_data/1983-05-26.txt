'Quant urn leap' IS a term 
often, perhaps too often, used 
to describe advances In 
technolo&>,)'. In reference to a

howe\'er, 'q uantum leap' is an

Sometimes, s tepping back 

i" moving forward. uch is 
the cast' for laser panto-
graph); it· straIghtforward 
method of chip creation 
harkenIng bark to the 
archaic lechnology of the 
Guttenberg press, 

Current chip technology 
can t race It... root s back to 
the dawn of the printing 
age. The pnnted \\ord was 
created by linll1g up slugs 
WIt h raised images of the 
desired letters carved into 
them. Drawings, howe\'er, 
were printed differently, 
the image etched into a 
block of metal three-
cltmensional ly , the ink-
coated upper edges tran -
(erring the picture to paper. 

The development of 
photography brought that 
cru de process to an 
unlamented end. Almost all 
of today's newspapers and 
magazines are printed on an 
offset press, allowing crisp, 
accurate printing in a 
fract ion of the time of the 
lalx)r-intensi\'e process of 
arranging individual pieces 
dema nded . 

The basis of offset 
print ing is a thin sheet of 
meta I ma ted on one SIde 
\\ I t h a I i g h t . s {' n SIt I \' e 
emulSIOn formulated to 
altracllnk TIll' emulsIon is 

exposed 111 much the same 
\\ay as a photogl'aph, 
()\ erlaid with a negative and 
exposed to an intense light 
source. The plate is then 
treated WIth chemicals tha t 
!lush off the une'\posed 
areas of the emuls ion , 
I('a\'i ng the deSIred image 
in t act. 

The actual process cur-
rently used to create a 
mIcrochip is qlllt e complex, 
but a SImplified look shows 
It s close ties with both 
photography and offse t 
printing .. 

First, a glass "negatl\'e" 
(called a reticle) i. designed 
by computer engineers in 
the desi red pattern , The 
si licon blank itself is then 
heated and coaled with a 
special light -se nsitive 
substance called "photore-
sist" and an ultraviolet 
light is shone through the 
reticle to expose the desired 
pattern onto the chip. 

When developed, most of 
the photoresist is flushed 
away, but the de ired 
pattern (as defined by the 
reticle) remains. The chip is 
then coated with whatever 
metal IS deemed to possess 
the electrical propertIes 
necessary and the process is 
repeated . as man y t inws as 
11l'Cl'ssary, wit h different 
metals il; dIfferent patt erns 

" stacked" ()Oe ulxm tht 
other, un til the ctlrnpleted 
chip IS formed. 

Irol1lcall} , this process 
makes for a large in\'est· 
ment of tIme and creates a 
great many unusable chips. 
The <.;ahation of the printed 
work is t he bane of t Iw 
computer indu..,try. 

La ser pantography 
eltm inates the necd for 
reticles . photnre..,ist, 
metallIC coat Ings, a nd , 
indeed , the whole dr(\\\n· 
()U t proce s curr ent Iy 
employed (sec 1.l(('()lJIpaJ/YIJIg 
,' /01"\'). A laser \\'I th an 
intensity a billion times 
greater than the sun etche~ 
the three-dimensional 
c;;tructure directly onto the 
chip. Gas "filters" in the 
laser impart the desired 
electrical properties directly 
to the silicon itself. Errors 
are almost impossible and 
the process is quick . 
painless. 

From carving images into 
lead, through the whole 
process of light sensitive 
coatings, and them back to 
the carver, a computer-
guided laser t hal can impart 
intelligence to a lump of 
crvstalli zed "and 1n a 
miltter of microseconds.

James R. Papp stated that the 
people who oppose the modern 
educational trend toward 
specialization "seem to have 
an idea that the 15th and 16th 
centuries were jam-packed 
with Leonardo daVinci's" and 
a l 0 s tated that "these 
people ... spend a lot of their 
time thinking of the ancient 
Greeks." What a fancifully 
inaccurate view! 

In reality. [ find that wewho 
emphaSIze the \'alue of the 
Renaissance \IIan do not 
delude ourseh'cs by bclic\ ing 
that the Renaissance Person 
wi II ever be a widespread 
academ IC phenomenon. 
Rather, we believe that the 
American educational ,-;ystem 
sho uld adopt programs 
allowing those of us who 
choose to puruse an inter, 
di sciplinary education the 
freedom to do o. This means 
allowing the tudent absolute 
contro l over hi s own 
educa tion. to the extent that 
all courses are hi s own 
c hoo s ing . provided the 
program is supported by an 
integrating philosopy and 
goal. Given s uch an opportun' 
ity. I myself would ha ve 
eliminated mu ch of the 
prerequisite cou r ses and 
moved direct ly into a four·year 
program co mposed of upper· 
di vis ion work including math, 
chemistry, physics, biology, 
psychology, hi tory, art, 
philosophy. and anthropology 
(WIth emphasis on numerical 
analysis, biochem istry, 
electronics and computers, 
neurobiology and genetics, all 
psychology, and very specific 
features in history, art, 
comparitive phi losophlcs and 
rehhrions), aimed toward a 
degree In "Sc ientific 

l'hilo~ophy and Application." 
alicmmg me the abIlity to 
approach ;,ctence With the 

interests of humanity. rather 
than industry , in mind. 

As to the u efulness of such 
an education,] need only point 
out that Edi on and Buck-
minister Fuller (as well as 
many others) were both self· 
educated Ren aissance Men 
who earned li vi ngs outsIde the 
academic·industrial main· 
st ream while contributing 
more to science and humanity 
than many dozens of 
traditional scielltists dUring 
equatible time pel uxi:", and 
t hatJoh n Lilly (a radical inter-

sugge!-.t and im'estigate the 
spreading belief that dolphllls 
are a~ IIltelligent a" humans 
and th us may event ually prove 
invaluable cohorts in the non· 
destructive harvesting of the 
wealth of the oceans. 

Note that those of us who 
va lue an interdisc iplinary 
education are for the most part 
convinced that many modern 
economic, acia!. and 
environmental problems are 
the result of a particularly 
virulent form of soc ial 
schizophrenia which led to the

Nuclear Weapons Protest Slated 
Editor: 

Hundred~ of thousands of 
people world\\ ide \\ ill protest. 
halt and disrupt the design. 
production, tran'iportation 
and deplovment of nuclear 
weapons on June 20, 19R3, 
InternatIOnal Di !-'Clrmament 
Action Day. The I 'C SD based 
affinity h'TOUP, Quetzacoatl. 
will gather with many other 
San Diegans to part lCipate in a 
vigil and non ,violent blockade 
at the entrance of the Ballast 
Point submarine base at Point 
Loma. We will be joining this 
international day of protest to 
focus attention on (1) global 
nuclear di s armament , (2) 
demilitari zation and non· 
intervention, (3) eq uitabl e 
distribution of wealth within 
and between nations. and (4) 
greater re pect for our planet's 
fragile environment. 

So. what does this mean for 
students at UCSD?Quiteoften 
we hear students being labeled 
as apathetiC toward s the 
issues outside their daily lives. 
We think. rather, that this is a 
feeli ng of powerlessness and 
h o peless ne ss. Recentl y 
students have watched our 
state legislators chop the UC 
budget without cons ideration 
of the consequences. Yet. here 
at Ballast Point submarine 
base the Federal Government 
has stationed more than 25 
nuclear powered fa<;t attack 
s ubmarine s armed with 
n uclear-t ipp ed S lT BROC 
torpedoes. General Dvnamics 
Convair in Kearnev 'Me;,a is 
producmg the sea launch and 
ground Inlssles. There have 

been test firings of the Ilew 
generation of sea launch cruise 
missiles from submannes ju~t 
off of San Clemente Island. 
San Diego is one of the most 
beautifu l places in Amt:nca to 
ItH' - It IS also a pnme target 
for Sm'iet Nuclear missile .... 

The time to act is no\\. We 
will join in protest \\ it h people 
t he wor ld over. especially I he 
peoples of Europe, ag,lItlst 
Reagan's "winnable nuclcar 
war." Students need to realize 
that they can make a 
difference in the world. Once 
t he bombs start dropping it 
will be too late. 

Man y America ns still hide 
under the ill usion of peace 
guaranteed by the concept of 
Mutua ll y Assured Destruction 
(MAD). Recall Jimmy Carter's 
Presidential Directi ve 59 
which contained three points, 
First. it called fo the creation of 
a rapid deployment stri ke 
force; second , it in st ituted the 
registration of all young men 
in preparation for a draft; 

third. and most importantly , it 
ordered the retargeting of 11S 

mlssile~ from I~ us;,ian cit ic~ to 
I~ussian 11lIs"ile sites. Thus 
began the ~hiit in lfS 'it ralPh')' 
to t he use of nuclear \\ ealxlIls 
111 an often..,l\e manner. 
N udear wal ha" no\\' become 
"\\innable," nol In the Illll1ds 
of the AIl1t'nCall people. but 111 
the mlllds of the Pent agon and 
our g<)\ernll1g elilt:, Republi , 
cans and ])emocratsallke. The 
unrel iabilily of high techno, 
IOh'Y makes it imjXlssible to 
knock out all of the SO\ iet 
lI1issiles in a "First Strike" 
maneuver. Even if 10 percent 
of the SO\'iet missiles sUf\'ive 
such an attack. you can kiss 
this co untr y good · bye. 
America's finest city will 
become America's fin es t 
cemetary. Tens of millions of 
American dea th s are now an 
accepted s ide effect of a 
"winnable" nuclear war.

WARNING 
FROM THE 

MATHEMATICS 
DEPARTMENT 

All students intending to enroll in a lower 
division mathematics course next fall are 
strongly urged to pre-enroll .D.2.W. The 

department anticipates having to turn away 
students from some of these courses as 

currently scheduled sections fill . Due to a 
cutback in the department's TA allocation 
next year, it will probably not be possible 
to add sections as needed to accommodate 
the demand. The Mathematics Department 
deeply regrets the necessity of abandoning 

its longstanding policy of allowing 
enrollment demand to dictate the number 

of sections.

sleep or study or talk . or who 
perhaps do not enjoy listening 
to vocalists who sound as if 
they are being disemboweled 
by a rusty sardine tin . will also 
be able to exercise their rights. 

I realize that one of the joy 
of lis tening to rock'n 'rol l is to 
epaler les bourgeois. It's fun to 
watch the tense. frightened ,

ha ve all so rt s of parks and 
beaches - indeed. all th e rest 
of South ern Californi a - to do

The MX's Legislative Comeback purely military · point of view the MX docsn't make all that 
much sense. But (il does) if you 
usc it solely as a means to get 
vou to the ultimate goal of 
(fewer warheads) and as 
lcverage(wit h) the Suviets, 
saying we have the national 
\\,111 to go forward with a new 
production line unless you 
agree to some sort of 
negot iat l()n~ . 

By MAXWELL GLEN AND 
CODY SHEARER 

Despite on'going doubt · 
about its value to US security, 
the MX has been making a 
steady comeback on Capitol 
Hill. 

Ironically, in the Senate its 
rebirth come as a result of a 
bipartisan arms cuntrul 
proposal by ens. William 
Cohen (R·Me.) and Sam Nunn 
(D·Ga.). Called "build·down," 
the plan tipulates that each 
-u perpower de ' \ roy two 
warheads fur every new one it 
introduces. In return for a 
White House endon;ement. 
Cohen and Nunn hme agreed 
to help salvage the president's 
plan to deploy 100 ;\lX mis ·lles 
111 eXist ing "i)os. 

'en. Cohen discussed the

And why is that so? I explam 
what the freeze does to our 
existing military programs 
and what it does to the 
Europeans for whom we are , 
now negotiat ing(in Geneva ). If 
you freeze nuclear weapons, 
t he Soviets get up and \\ alk 
away from the negotiating 
table with an edge. 

But I also point OUI that the 
freeze advocates have a very 
admirable point. That is thal 
we are now adding layer upon 
layer of weapons. So how du [ 
reconcile these two thillg~ -
the need to build more 
survivable weapons systems 
and get more secure sea· dnd 
air · based systems? Well, [ pa~' 
a price. And the price for 
modernrLation is reductions.

The final 
Chapter 

By CLYDfNf Nff 
Three years ago. about this same 

time of the year. George lucas gave 
film audiences across the world the 
all-time cliffhanger ending to a 
motion picture in The Empire Strikes 
Back 

Is luke Skywalkers father really 
Oarth Vader? 

Will they rescue Han Solo from his 
carbonite tomb? 

Who is the other hope? 
What will happen to the menage a 

trois relationship between luke, l£ia, 
and Han? In other words who gets the 
girl? 

Return of the Jedi. impossible as it 
might seem, handles each of these 
questions and as a film, it captures 
much of the same magic that \vas in 
the original Stdr IVar.s film. along with 
some \cry impressive and ~plashy 
special elfcc~. 

Most of us were in high school or 
even junior high ,>(hool \\hen Star 
Wars was first released in 1977. 
Contrary to popular belief at this 
time. Star Wars was a big gamble for 
20th Century Fox. and no one could 
foresee the magnitude of the succes.c, 
that the film did. Star Wars, Chapter 
Four - The New Hope, left audiences 
screaming for more and was such a 
phenomenal success that it broke all 
previous box office records. and up 
until last summer, it was the largest 
grossing film of all time. 

Return of the Jedi, is Chapter Six of 
the nine films that might be made of 
the entire Star Wars series. Though 
the film only opened yesterday. there 
has already been some criticism that 
the film has taken on a soap opera-
like quality. sort ora Dynasty in outer 
space. The important thing to 
remember is that lucas has to wrap 
up all the loose ends that were in 
Empire Strikes Back The questions 
that he left us at the end of the film 
are not the type of questions that one 
takes lightly, Identity is an important 
thing: imagine the crisis that Luke 
experienced when Darth Vader told 
him that he was his father. 

The first 35 minutes or so of the 
film is devoted to the rescue of Han 
Solo from the vile clutches of Jabba 
the Hutt, Never in my wildest 
nightmares did I ever imagine 
anything as gross and disgusting as 
Jabba the Hutt. It resembled 
something that would result from 
crossing Humpty-Dumpty and a large 
green lizard. with sllme DOling forth

Although it was a "bad part of 
town," we were in the middle of a 
large, seemingly endless field 
under a leaden sky and, almost 
like a cartoon, I can see the flat 
shout of terror come from his 
mouth and, like a still or that 
Tarot card The Fool, I can see his 
step frozen in the air as he clicks 
from the moment before seeing 
the snake into that frame and, 
clang, out of it into the jump and 
my reaction and so on.

Drama season closes 
on a 'Rainbow ShaWl' 

UCSD will conclude it's J 982-
83 Champagne Season of plays 
with the West Coast Premiere of 
Hoon On A Uainbow Shawl by 
Errol John, playing tonight 
through Sunday and June I 
through 4, 

[rrol John, West Indian 
playwright. actor and writer for 
radio, television, film and stage, 
first gained public acclaim with 
his play Moon On A Rainbow 
ShaWl, which won first prize in 
the London Obsener's Play 
Competition of 1957 and played 
throughout Europe, Argenti na 
and the United States, After this 
success, John was awarded a 
Guggenheim Fellowship in 
1958. 

John 's main theme is escape, 
and in Hoon On A Rainbow 
Shawl he reveals the various 
traps which destroy those who 
remain. The action of the play 
takes place in East Dry River. 
Port'oF-Spain, on a backyard 
property of Old Mack 's one year 
after V-J Day. The trap is lhe 
Trinidad backyard with a 
prostitute exhibitioning all her 
American sailors: a poor 
'respectable " womall with a 

studious young daughter who 
goads her husband into theft 
and jail ; and a pregnant girl now 
abandoned. 

From this vise Ephraim tries 
to escape. He is a young 
handsome trolley-bus driver in 
line for promotion, but he 
rejects thb way out as illusory. 
His driven, single-minded ness 
causes him to brush aside the 
girl who loves him and the 
people who care for him, 
recalling the time he put his 
foster-mother in a home to die 
after she had gotten in the way. 

caribbean plays come from a 
world of linguistic vitality, of 
improvised music and assorted 
animal noises all seeming to 
wage war on nature. John writes 

of his native home, the little 
island of Trinidad, but the 
themes of exile, escape and 
rootlessness are common to all 

Ic~ fortunate throughout the 
world. 

A revised version of the 1957 
Moon On A Rainbow Shawl was 
presented at the East Eleventh 
Street Theatre in New York city 
in 1962 with James Earl Jones 
and Cicely Tyson heading the 
cast. Direc ted by George Roy 
Hill and produced by Kermit 
Bloomgarden and Harry Joe 
Brown, Jr., it ran for J05 
performances. 

The UCSO Theatre production 
features a cast of seven actors 
from UCSO 's gradua te and 
undergraduate theatre training 
program and nine community 
members from San Diego 
County. Phillip Cuny will star in 
the role of Ephraim, Maria 
Porter will play the poor 
respectable" woman Sophie 

Adams, Miki Kim will portray 
the pregnant girl Rosa and 
Hector Correa will appear as lhe 
beleaguered husband Charles 
Adams. 

In conjunction with the play's 
opening, the works of two 
contemporary Black San Diego 
artists will be on display in the 
lobby of the Mandell Weiss 
Center beginning today. Chuck 
Rucker and Jean Cornwell will 
display portraits and paintings 
on glass in the theme of the 
Caribbean culture. 

Directed by Floyd Gaffney,

hands, they become double-
minded, This creates a fear of 
death and an attachment to life. 
The mind loses its fluidity. A 
Jidai's mind must be devoid of 
all fear, free from all forms of 
attachment. and a master of 
itself. Then it will know no

will follow its own destiny. Uke

The life and 
hard times 
of Scandal 

By M.S, HUNT 
lack Smith is the founder of 

the rock group Scandal. and he 
is very tired. His group is on the 
tail end ofa rigorous nationwide 
tour. and the effects of having 
just arrived in San Diego from 
Las Vegas are showing in his 
eyes. He is tired but happy, for 
touring takes a very close 
second to his favorite activity; 
recording new tracks for 
Scandal's upcoming LP: 

"We've been really busy. 
c risscrossing the country 
several times, and we should 
have an LP out as soon as we get 
off the road in July sometime. I 
like going straight into the 
studio right after coming off a 
tour. it keeps us in touch with 
the audience." 

Scandal's hit. " Goodbye To 
Yo!.. " features the talents of 
Patty Smyth. the group's sultry 
lead singer. Thanks to her rough 
cut. tough voice. Scandal 's five 
song EP has sold over 250,000 
copies, Says Smith. " Wc 've sold 
that many albums and I have yet 
to actually see what kind of 
person Ibtens Lo us. I picture 
the type of person as being 
young: 15 to 20 years old , 
someone who would have 
groups like the Police and Duran 
Duran in their collection." 

Smith does not hide the fact 
tha t Patty is the high light of the 
group. The fact that "he 
dominates both video!> and livc 
concert performances pleases 
Smith. In fact. he attributes 
much of Scandal's success to 
Patty's attractiveness and 

lack Smith and ratty Smyth of the popular rock band Scandal. 

vivacity. 
Smith auditioned over eighty 

prospects before choosing 
Patty. He did not Quite know 
what he was searching for but he 
knew he wanted a female lead 
for hi., music. At the group s 
conc.eption Patty and Smith did 
not initially get along. sht' being 
from the streets of :'leI\, York 
City and he from ~uburban 
Westport. Con necticut. 

The contrast of his 10\\ key 
style and her flamboyant 
singing mix well 011 stage 
however. producing a lively. 
energeti c show that gets the 
audience involved. Smith 

affects a casualness in talking 
about the type of music that 
Scandal plays. 

I call our music ·Power·Pop 
for lack of a better expre.,sion. 
It's pretty obvious we 're not jan 
and we re not cla~.,ical. .,0 what 
docs it millter?" 

Smith al')() bristles at the 
mention of a rescmlJlam.e 
between Patty and Pat &natar 

'We didn't design the group 
to look or play like anyone ehe. 
There was no Scandal concept 
when I started putting the group 
together. Things just 
happened."

Concert Line 

It's US fest time again 
Once agam. a festival concert 

is being brought to Southern 
california. As with all festivals, 
there is a central theme at the 
US fest. The basic theme behind 
the US Fest is a movement from 
the seventies me" decade into 
a new idealism in the eighties 
that focuses on the concept of 
unity. 

Originally, the US fest was 
meant to be a forum of new and 
progressive music. This idea was 
abandoned . however to 
increase ticket sales by adding a 
mondo heavy metal day. 

Ide:t1istically, the US Festival 
is Just another promotions 
gimmick designed to take an 
investment and make it a 
profitable venture after an 
alotted amount of time. 

On the first day. which is 

billed as new musk. has The 
Clash. Men at Work. Stray 
Cats. flock of Seagulls. The 
[nglish 8eat Oingo Boingo, 
Wall of Voodoo. INXS and 
DiVinyls. 

Day two is hea\'Y metal day 
with Van Halen. Scorpions. 
Triumph . Judas Priest. Ozzy 
OSbourne. Joe Walsh and 
Motley Crue. 

Day three brings a more 
interesting concept of 
promotions. most notably 
because of the inclusion of 
David Bowie. Other artists 
included are Stevie Nicks. 
John Cougar. The Pretenders. 
Missing Persons U2. 
Quarternash , Berlin . and 
Little Sleven and the 
Disciples of Soul. All thb is 
happening this weekend.

Rumaging through 
the heavy metal pile 

By KARL DAfGUNG the best work of his career. The 
vocals are consistent, the music 
is well written. and the album is 
well produced. 

In recent months several new 
" heavy metal " oriented albums 
have hit the market. some of 
which are instrumentally 
brilliant and hard driving and 
others that are downriaht 
depressing to the heavy metal 
aficionado. 

Gary Moore. formerly of Thin 
Lizzy and Coluseum, has 
released a "hot and cold" album 
entitled Corridors of Power, half 
of which is packed with 
incredibly fast solo lines and 
throbbing rhythm tracks and 
half of which is obviously 
designed for FM radio listening 
twelve year olds. Moore'ssoloat 
the beginning of "End of the 
World" is absol utely amazing -
comparable to nearly any hard 
rock guitar solo on vinyl and 
well worth the price of the 
album in itself, 

The best of the new releases is 
the Micheal Schenker Group's 
Assault Attack. The blazing 
inferno on the cover 
silhouetting (presumably) 
Schenker brandishing a guitar

SWORD AND THE STONE THE LAST UNICORN 
1~ j I'}1)11 11. ;) -1 ,:,1 rJ 

6 malus May 26. 1983 

something of a disappointment 
from the boys who brought us 
last year's High and Dry with 
such heavy metal gems as 
"Saturday Night" and " Let It 
Go," P/.iromania sounds like a 
mellowed-out Nigh and Dry 
with synthesizer lines, 

Two heavy metal standbys. 
Ozzy Osbourne and Black 
Sabbath have cashed in the 
chips with their last live albums. 
entitled Speak of the Devil and 
Live Evil, respectively. Former 
Bla ck Sabbath member 
Osbourne released his new 
double album comprised of old 
Black sabbath standards in 
December. Ozzy's voice on 
Speak of the Devil is virtually 
gone and his feeble yelps and 
growls that pass for vocals are 
rendered unlistenable by a shrill 
sound system. The backing band 
headed by guitarist Barad Gillis 
does a passable job. with Gillis 
ripping away on some fantastic 
solos and generating a fantastic 
heavy metal tone color. 

Black Sal1bath. minus Ozzy 
Osbourne, is a bit more 
endurable on Live fvil. Vocalist 
Ronnie James Dio produces a 
fine effort. and guitarist Tony 
lommi produces some 
interesting "Sabbath -esq ue" 
lead lines and earth shaking 
power chords. but the 
production comes off a bit flat. 

The most pathetic of the new 
releases is the Swiss band 
Krokus' Headhunter, This 
sounds like a bad AC-DC. and 
Vocalist Marc Storace sounds 
like AC-DC's Brian Johnson 
would with a sore throat. 
Guitarist fernando Von Arb is 
one of the most uninspired, 
sludge producing in recent 
years. The world needs only one 
AC DC. and a bad clone of them 
is completely unendurable. 

In this set of new Heavy Metal 
releases, Schenker and Moore 
should not be missed. Krokus 
and Osbourne should be 
avoided, and the rest arejust run 
of the mill, 

Scandal 
continued From page 5 

Scandal is climbing the 
ladder of success, with a new 
album in the making. and an 
opportunity to tour with the 
Kinks. Smith attributes some of 
this to exposure on MTV, the 
cable music channel, who 
played two of Scandal's videos 
(they currently have only five 
songs out on an EP) for a 
national audience. 

Says Smith. "Things would 
have been a lot slower without 
the videos on MTV. and we 
recognize that fact. We also 
recognize our audience. It's 
miraculous that we 've been so 
far in such a short time, and we 
haven ' t forgotten our 
audience," 

As for the future ; "We just 
want to write more music and 
put on better shows. We just 
want to get better for the people 
that listen to us."

One of the most exci ting 
pa rts of the film is the speed 
cycle chase through the forests 
of Endor, This was accomplished 
by using a steady-c.lm at one 
third of its normal speed. which 
is called undercranking the 
film. When the 111m is run 
through a projector at normal 
speed. i t appears that the cycles 
are going at J 50 mph . Though 
this was exciting in the film , 
Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill

lor such a short time in the new 
film that one is quitc 
di~ppointed not to hear more 
words of wbdom by the little 
green guy from DaQouhba. 

lame Fisher remarked in a 
recent inlen iew that she felt 
that she had really grown up 
with George Lucas. In a way. all 
of us who are fans of George 
Lucas's films have grown up 
with him. Though the characters 
in his films are far removed from 
the reality of our day to day

• SlaH Writer 
The main purpose of IM sports at UCSD IS to allow the 

students here to compete against each other In an organized 
fa~hion. The main idea is that participants have fun - winning 
and losing is not important. Anyone who believes thIS obvlOusl} 
doesn't play rM sports. Well . I wouldn 't say every team lives by 
the motto "Win or Die," but a lot of the teams have been known 
to give new meaning to the word "sandbag." On this nole, r give 
you a little playoff report, along \\ ith the best - and the worst -
teams in volleyball and softba ll.

Running Thoughts 
ByMIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Sla ff Wri ters 
WHAT 'S GOING ON H E RE DEPT. TheSan DiegoSockers 
won a Major Indoor Soccer League championship the other 
night. Ho-hum , Does anybody really care? Sure. the game was a 
sellout, but San Diegans would pack the Sports Arena for a title 
game if the sport were croquet. The true measuring stick was to 
see how many fans showed up for the victory celebration the 
followi ng day. So on Tuesday we went downtown to see the 
Spirit of San Diego come alive, and instead, we saw a few 
hundred loyalists gathered around one loud speaker listening to 
incumbent mayor Roger Hedgecock prai e Head Coach Ron 
Newma n for the wonderful job he did . There were so few people 
in attendance tha t we were able to meet and become acquainted 
on a first name basis with the 500 and change that decided to 
show up. Where is your appreciation, San Diego? All theSockers 
did was to win the indoor title for the second consecutive season 
and they can't even get a thousand spectators to show up for the 
celebration. PIT-I-FUL. 
NOT TO BE B E LIEVED DEPT. No one has tougher luck 
than Padre southpaw Dave Dravecky , Dravecky, whose record 
currently stands at 6-3. has lost all three decis ions by a total of 
four runs, He has allowed a total of five earned runs in the three 
setback while his team has su pported him with just three runs, 
With any luck at all Dravecky would be8-1 and right on schedu le 
for a 20-win season. Only Steve Carlton. Jerry Reuss, and 
Fernando are better right now than the Padre sophomore and 
that's saying something. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, OK. OK, people have been getting 
on our case all year long for not going out on the limb enough, 
[(ow about this: Not only will the Philadelphia 76ers win 
tonight's second game of the NBA Championship Series. but 
they will stun the sporling world by s\\eeping the men from 
Inglewood in four straight. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Why is Czechoslovakian tennis star 
Ivan Lendl ranked number one in the world, winning so many 
tennis tournaments? It appears Lend! falls under the same 
category as the great three-yea r-old racehorse Desert Wine. Bot h 
need to take Lasix, a drug that stops an athlete from bleeding 
while under competition. The calch is that Lasix is prohibited in 
a few states for race horses, but available to all tennis players ,

Football players enjoy a 

seven·mo nth off-season. 
Baseball and basketball 
players rest for six , This break 

I~ not on ly necessary to repair

relieve fatigue and mental

the PCA tour affords a two-
