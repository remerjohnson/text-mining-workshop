AS Expansion Highligh 5 
Import of Next Election 

With the approach of another 
election of AS officers the e-
lectorate is once again wondering 
just who it is who has composed 
the seemingly anonymous body 
that has represented them for 
the last year, and what they 
have been doing with their time 
and the student body's money. 

In an interview with AS Pre-
sident Tom Shepard, the Triton 
Times drew the basic conclusion 
that the importance of the AS 
organization transcends merely 
the AS Senate who meet once 
a week to discuss issues, pass 
resolutions, and appropriate 
money. 

It also suggested that the p0-
tentialities for realizing the ott-
heard cry for "student power" 
can and to some extent are 
being fulfilled through the stu-
dent government apparatus, 
whose limits are stU! being ex-
plored. 

COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS 

A function of the AS which 
has grown in importance during 
Shepard's administration ~ that 
of appointing student members 
of sundry committees. Shepard 
stated that there are currently 
student members on nearly e-
very committee on campus, en-
compassing three general cate-
gories: AS Committees, Aca-
demic Senate Committees, and 
Administrative Committees. Al-
so, the AS has the authority to 
establish as many student 
committees as it feels are ne-
cessary to deal with the affairs 
of the AS. 

A particularly important addi-
tion during thls past year was 
CPE, Center for Participatory 

education, whlch has become a 
permanent standing committee 
funded by the AS. CPE, like 
its sister organizations at Ber-
keley and other campuses, will 
help students initiate courses and 
play an active role in their edu-
cation. 

All Administrative Commit-
tees have student representation 
with full voting privileges, rang-
ing from the ore out of eight 
on the Campus Planning Com-
mittee to the four out of eight 
on the Registration Committee. 

The later is an extremelyim-
portant body, for it determines 
the use of the $100 per quarter 
that each student pays; the stu-
dents' representatives on thls 
committee recently decided that 
a $120,000 request from the P. 
E. Department for a new track 
was not leg1t1mate, and the ex-
penditure was denied. 

Although the Academic Senate 
has been reluctant to give stu-
dents a meaningful voice in aca-
demic affairs, the AS has suc-
ceeded in gaining at least token 
representation on nearly every 
faculty committee, although all 
student representatives are non-
voting. 

STUDENT INFLUENCE 

The composition of the AS, 
and especially the AS president, 
determines the type of persons 
who will be purporting to repre-
sent student opinion. According 
to the current AS constitution, 
the president appoints all com-
mittee members, subject to the 
approval of the senate. 

However, the procedure next 
year wtll probably be for a "com-
mittee on Committees" to make 
all recommendations to the se-

nate. Also, as tar as AI) com-
mittees go, each senator will be 
designated as the head of an 
executive committee. 

Shepard stressed the im-
portance of these committee ap-
pointments, stating that the fa-
culty and administrators usually 
relied heavily upOn these persons 
as a guage of what the students 
were thlnking. 

Shepard claimed that student 
representatives on the Special 
Athletic Adv~ory Committee, the 
Long Range Development Com-
mittee, and the Registration 
Committee had succeeded in in-
fluencing a major campus ~sue; 
the Intercollegiate Athletic Pro-
gram. 

Shepard stressed the impor-
tance of student influence at a 
campus in its beginning stages 
of development. 

PUBLIC RELATIONS 
The AS is also quite influen-

tial in a number of unofficial 
ways. Shepard stressed the im-
relations" role, having partici-
pated himself in numerous ne-
gotiation sessions with campus 
and community groups as a stu-
dent representative. 

As a source of student opin-
The Chancellor and various 

administrators respect the AS 
as a source of student opinion, 
and the AS was called upon by 
the Chancellor and the Chairman 
of the Academic Senate concern-
ing the question of rehiring Pro-
fessor Marcuse. 

A convincing paralle I can be 
drawn to the trad1t1onal interest 
groups. Unified action by the 
AS and its equivalent on the 
other UC campuses has proved 
an effective lobbying device for 
the UC student body. 

In relation to the scope of the 
AS involvement, Shepard stated; 
"apparently the AB can't speak 
ror the student body on issues 
completely outside the university 
but most issues relate to the uni-
versity in some way. 

The AB tnfluence has been felt 
at the beginning of the year as 
they provided the funds that en-
abled Eldridge Cleaver to appear 
on campus. Later in that quar-
ter, during the Regents meeting, 
the AS conducted informational 
ralUes and distributed leaflets. 

It was through the efforts of 
the AS that the meeting site 
was changed to the gym, thereby 
enabling 500 students to view the 
proceedings. 

AB EXPENDITURES 
A traditional fUnction of stn-

dent governments has been to 
augment the social life of the 
campus. Therefore a large por-
tion of the AS budget has gone 
to the Program Board, with its 
four committees: Performing 
Arts, Lectures, Social Events 
and Coffee Hut. These expen-
ditures, totalling some $17,5000, 
have brought Quicksilver, Tea-
tro Campesino, Eldrige Cleaver, 
Flash Gordon, Hard Luck Boy, 
and Elvin Jones to campus, to 
mention a few. 

The AS provides about 35 per 
cent of the budget of the Com-
munications Board, which gives 
financial support to the recog-
nized campus media (Triton 
Times, KDST, Ham radio 
station). Other AS expenditures 
this year have gone towards pay-
ing the salaries of AS officers 
and executive secretaries. 

No student organizations, other 
than AS committees and those 
groups already mentioned, 
receive specific financial sup-
port, although the senate has, 
upon occasion, donated money to 
various groups for special rea-
sons. 

Money was set aside this year 
and last for the proposed stu-

MIlitary 
RE crurtHEnt 
RAllY: 1):00 
ate<!. A referendum will 'be on 
the ballot in the upcoming elec-
tion to approve the levying of 
a special fee to provide the 
funds for the comples. 
STUDENT-RUN FACILITIES 

There are many areas in which 
the AS can play an increasingly 
large role. The concept of stu-
dent owned and operated faci-
littes began with the Coffee Hut. 
Next year it is hlghly possible 
that the snack bars in the Ba-
sic Science BuUding, Muir Cafe-
teria, North Dining Hall, and 
Scripps, will be run by the AB. 

According to Shepard, the main 
philosophy for student govern-
ment in dealing with these pro-
blems should be to recycle any 
profits back to the stUdents. 
"Control of these operations 
should be solely with the stu-
dents; they are a captive aud-
ience, and it is necessary that 
the services be responsive to

McGill to be Inaugurated, 
CECA Voices Opposition 

Chancellor WllUam McG1ll's 
inauguration comes today not 
without any opposition from local 
forces. Perhaps the most. visible 
evidence of th~ appeared as a 
full page advertisement in Wed-
nesday's San Diego Union (cost-
ing around $1800). 

In it the "Citizens to End Cam-
pus' Anarchy" called for the Re-
gents "to withhold the inaugura-
tion of W1lliam McG11l as Chan-
cellor. • .pending an investiga-
tion." 

The petition furthermore pro-
tested McGill's (and Marcuse's) 
salary and "having to finance 
the means of bringing about our 
own destruction." 

"In an effort to preserve us 
trom those forces that are "Quick 
lo claim 'Rights' yet refuse to 
.grant them; who worship dissent 
yet tolerate none; and who, by 
the weapon of mass interference, 
impose their own brand of cen-
sorship," the citizens pledged to 
"continue the fight for dismissal 
of McG1ll and Marxist Marcuse." 

In any event, the formal in-
auguration of Dr. W1lliam J. Mc-
G11l as Chancellor of UCSO takes 
place at 11:00 a.m. today in the 
gymnasium. In honor of this all 
classes are cancelled for the day 
but buildings, laboratories and 
offices wUl remain open. 

Participants in the academic 
ceremony will include repre-

sentatives of the nine campuses 
of the University of Caltfornia 
and the statewide office of the 
University; delegates from uni-
verSities, colleges and junior 
colleges in California, and re-
presentatives from colleges and 
universities that Dr. McGill has 
been associated with during ~ 
academic career. 

The Official Party for the cere-
mony will include University 
President Charles J. Hitch; Mc-
Gill; DeWitt A. Higgs, Chairman 
of the University Board of Re-
gents; and the Reverend Lou~ 
H. Evans, Pastor of the La Jolla 
Presbyterian Church. Also in the 
Official Party will be members 
of the University Board of Re-
gents; Dr. Walter Munk, Chair-
man of the UCSD Academic Sen-
ate; and Tom Shepard, President 
of the Associated Students of 
UCSD. 

Dr. Denis Fox, Professor of 
Marine Biochemistry at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, will 
serve as University Marshal and 
lead the Official Party .. Dr. Ted 
Forbes, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Physical Education, and 
Dr. Andrew Wright. Professor 
of EngUsh Literature, wUl serve 
as Deputy Marshals and lead the 
delegates and UCSD faculty. 

A luncheon for the Official 
Party and all delegates w1ll take 
place at 1:00 p.m. atthe Atlantis 

---D.E. 
Restaurant in Mission Bay Park. 
A publlc open house w1ll be held 
on the UCSD campus from 1:00 
to 4:00 p.m. Displays have been 
set up and guided tours of the 
various offices and laboratories 
w1ll be offered. 

Scheduled during the day are 
laser beam and holograph de-
monstrations conducted by grad-
uate students in the Department 
of Aerospace and Mechanical En-
gineering Sciences; a do-it-your-
self space rendezvous simulation 
allowing v~itors to control 
spacecraft to a rendezvous with 
a target; and a experiment es-
tabUshing the validity of sight-
ings taken by astronaut Gordon 
Cooper during a recent space 
mission. 

Sfudents face Hearing as 
Controversy Continues 

The situation of the eight stu-
dents involved in the Marine con-
troversy changed last week. Ad-
ministrative handling of disciplin-
ary action halted and the problem 
passed into the hands of the Com-
mittee on Student Conduct. 

According to Dean Murphy this 
is the standard procedure for any 
student who rejects the adm1n~­
trative disciplinary action pro-
posed for that student. Murphy 
suggested that the eight students 
accept probationary status with the 
condlUon that they apologize to 
tile academic community for 
attempting to represent the com-
munity by their action. 

Since they never claimed to re-
present the community and because 
tIley feel that military system 
stands in conflict with the alleged 
coals of the university system, 
the students apparently did not feel 
they could apologize for their 
action. 

On Friday, April 4, SOS held 
a rally in the plaza. The rally 
was an attempt to inform the stu-
dent-body concerning marine re-
cruitment policy and, on a larger 
scale, the historical actions and 
objectives of the marine corps. 
The attendance at the rally varied 
from about 200 people at the most 
to 50 people as interest fell. 

In the last wee ' the eight stu-
dents received a letter from Dean 
Murphy informing them of their 
reference to the Committee on 
student Conduct. Th students 
had given Murphy a statement 
which he rejected. The ess nce 
of their statement was a condem-
nation of those lnstitutuions, in-
cluding the univers ity, which in 
any way are involved in th up-

pression of foreign peoples strug-
gling for a democratic socialist 
way of life. 

The students are now to appear 
before the Committee on student 
Conduct on Friday, April 18, at 
7:00 p.m. Originally they were 
scheduled for Tuesday olthat week, 
but due to a schedule conflict 
on the part of some members 
of the Committee the date had 
to be changed. (Incidently. on 
Tbursday, April 17, a navy re-
cruiter is scheduled to appear 
on campus and SDS is now at-
tempting to organize some type 
of protest around that event. The 
new date for the trial also coin-
cides with the Buddy Miles con-
cert.) 

The hearing is to be an open 
one, allowing approximately 25 
observers into the room. The 
limit on outsiders is a result 
of the room capacity. The hear-
ing w1ll be held in Room 506 
Matthews Campus. 

The students will have to face 
charges for violating the following 
rules as outlined in the "Univer-
sity standard of Conduct" and as 
interpreted by Dean Murphy: 

1) obst ructing or disrupting 
.. ... authori1ed activities on uni-
versity prel1ises,"j 

2) violat,ng" ... university p0-
licies or ••• campus regulations, in-

4) failing" .. .to comply with dir-

COUNCIL AND MAYA: 

The Issue of the Triton Times 
on April 4 carried a statement 
attributed to me which does not 
portray my views correctly. The 
statement Is "he frankly stated 
that as far as he is concerned 
plans for Third College are too 
far along to be substantially 
changed. JJ 

As you know, I have indicated 
to you in writing that I believe 
that the administration and cur-
riculum of Third College could 
be structured so as to reflect 
the spirit of a number of your 
proposals. This Impression is 
reinforced by a long discussion 
between the Chancellor and the 
Third College Planning Faculty, 
as we]) as with Provost Rappa-
port. This discussion took place 
on Friday, April 4, i.e., the day 
on which the Triton Times ar-
Ucle appeared. 

I have urged the Third Col-
lege Faculty to meet with you 
and to atte mpt to get these dis-
cussions going. The cement is 
definite ly not frozen on Third 
College. Serious talk now would 
be ver useful.

Dear Edltor: 
Any of you who attended the 

First Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Memorial Service at the Los 
Angeles Shrine Auditorium on 
Good Friday evening were privi-
leged to hear Mr. James Met-
calf, a young man, age 13 yrs. 
(that's right, 13), from Marks, 
Mississippi. 

Mr. Metcalf spoke eloquently 
of conditlons in Mississippi, and 
the U.S. generally, which results 
in Mrs. Metcalf raising a family 
of eight on $69 per month while 
Senator Eastland receives nearly 
a quarter of a mimon dollars 
per year in farm subsidies. 

The Saturday before Mr. Met-
calf appeared at the Memorial 
Service , his home had been burn-
ed by arsonists, The Southern 
California branch of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Confer-
ence-West, has undertaken to fi-
nance rebuilding the Metcalf 
home. 

As a middle aged. middle class 
white Protestant, I wish to pre-
sent a moderate challenge to 
UCSD students, moderate, con-
servative, radical (right or left), 
black, white, yellow, brown and 
green, who do not conside r the m-
selves bigots, to put at least a 
small amount of cash where their 
mouths are. 

This is no case of an Eldridge 
Cleaver or a Huey Newton, about 
whom people who are not radical-
leftists may have honest reserva-
tions, but of a Christian famlly 
non-violently demanding their 
place in the American sun. 

I will match 50% of student 
contributions, up to $100 of my 
money and wlll solicit additlonal 
matching contributions beyond 
this amount from myassociates. 
Make checks payable to SCLC 
and mark them for the Jimmy

Dear Editor: 
In the field of education the 

mania for security is exe mpli -
fied by the system known as 
tenure; the granting of a per-
manent position to an individual 
who has, satisfactorily completed 
a trial period of a number of 
years . 

Tenure is a practice which 
naturally follows from the 
philosophy of collectivism. It 
is a technique to deny individual 
ability for the sake of the" se-
curity" of the masses. It is 
a means of rewarding medio-
crity and allowing It to degen-
erate into stagnant parasitism. 
Academic tenure creates scho-
lastic ~omnambulism. 

A tenured employee is free to 
seek employment elseWhere, but 
the employer of a tenured em-
ployee is not free to replace 
that employee with a more high-
ly qualified individual. 

We can now witness the re-
sults of this coercive practice 
by noting the intellectual inac-
tivity of many tenured teachers 
and professors. The tragic con-
sequences for students who study 
under these individuals cannot 
be estimated. 

Those who criticize ivory to-
wer high priest s from Mt. Olym-
pus are naturally di s missed as 
anU- intellectual racis ts and fa-
cist muckworms.

9uut E ~aJ By John Honigsfeld 
Military Traps Students 
Colleges and universities are engaged directly in training students 

for employment in the defense industry and the whole mUlti-bUlion 
dollar mllitary machlnary. 

All students who are studying the technical fields of engineering. 
physics, chemistry, and mathematics should be aware that th~ ma-
jority of jobs that will be available to them upon graduation WIll be 
for the military establishment or for firms contracted by the mili-
tary estabUshment. 

I have two years experience as a scientific computer programmer, 
and I also have a masters degree in mathematics. For the past 
several months I have watched advertisements and maintained other 
contacts with jobs which would utilize my experience as a program-
mer. I have found that the more technical education a person has, 
the more likely he is to wind up working directly or indirectly for 
the military. 

Nearly all the companies which had an interest in me were deve-
loping projects for war technology, nuclear weapons, or space tech-
nology. One firm was concerned with the effects of nuclear wea-
pons on mUltary jets and land vehicles, another was developing com-
puter systems for Naval ships, and still another was computerizing 

r-~--::=::::=~::=:::;;;iiii~;;~~::=~;:~~;----l ~--------i and evaluating data on the nuclear testing of bombs currently being conducted in the Southwestern United 8tates. Non-defense jobs which would utilize my qualifications were more rare and consti-
tuted only a small percentage of the total. 

Look through the he Ip-wanted ads of the Sunday newspaper, and 
you will find the companie s which are the highest paying, which run 
the largest ads, and which have the most jobs available are under 
contract to the military or to some semi-military agency. Most 
of the se firm s eufimistlcally refer to themselves as aerospace 
companies. 

Most of the students at UCSD who are studying technical and scientific 
subjects soon will find themselves working for these companies. The 
college and universities are training scientists and engineers, and 
since the defense industry Is the major employer of graduates with 
these skills , it becomes clear that the schools are perpetuating the 
fires of war by tossing the graduating students in for fuel. 

Most schools of higher education offer extension courses speci-
fically designed to meet the needs of the defense firms in the sur-
rounding community. These firms use the facilities of the university 
for thetr work and for continuing and improving the expertise of its 
employees. San Diego and Sorrento Valley firms use the computers, 
librarie s, and classrooms at UCSD. 

According to my experience, once a student with a technical major 
accepts a job for a defense firm, he becomes insensitive to the various 
m1Utary uses of the products manufactured and the services fUrnished 
by the firm. He becomes satisfied to collect his big check, to walt 
for his periodic pay raises , and to enjoy the comforts of modern life. 

Certainly most technical students have no idea for what sort of 
work their schooling has been preparing them. They don't realize 
that technical courses In physical sciences and mathematics are 
stressed for their applications to m1l1tary technology as well as for 
their academic Importance. When the days come to find a job, which 
are the forms that come to the school piacement ofrice with the 
highest salaries and with some of the nicest working conditlons and 
locations? The students have been trapped into working for the mlUtary 
estabUshment. 

-lAP I 
April 11, 1969 

We came to San Francisco to 
march for peace. It was April 
1967, the day of the spring mobi-
lization. The people were all 
there 50,000 strong; doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, students, 
children, dogs. and Allan Gins-
burg. 

We stood around for a, while 
on Market street while hippies 
from the Haight (then having its 
best days) spread love, flowers, 
oranges, and all kinds of goodies. 
We marched to Kezar stadium 
escorted by police, mllitary ob-
servers, screaming patriots, and 
a lot of good will by the people 
of San Francisco. 

At the park there were a lot 
of speaker s and there was a 
band, a local band that played in 
Golden Gate Park on Sundays. 
From the first "Come all you 
big strong men, Uncle Sam needs 
your help again" everyone in the 
place was aware of Country Joe 
and the Fish and knew that they 
weren't ordinary. 

They were a revolutionary mu-
sic band, the music wasn't just 
to dance to, it was to feel, en-
joy, live, and most of all to think 
about. The sound was born out 
of the politically artistic atmos-
phere of the flowering of the 
Haight-Ashbury. 

The untrained genius of Joe 
McDonald put together beautiful 
melodies and words which told of 
the new things happening to the 
hippies. When CJ & F did a show 
it wasn't just a concert It was an 
experience. 

They did things like play base-
ball and other things to mock the 
status quo in American SOCiety, 
witness such sons as Superbird, 
and Harlem. They glorilied the 
culture of the Haight in their 
songs as well as subtley knock-
ing the Soviet Union and Marx-
is m-Leninism In Not So Sweetly 
Martha Lorraine. 

Country Joe has a lot to say 
in critiCism of the American and 
Russian systems, but he pre-
sents it as part of a ooautlIul 
package , words and music con-
form to each other. On stage 
its hard to tell what's going to 
happen, maybe this time they'll 
stage a mock trial of Nixon or 
something equally thrilling. 

Country Joe at the Community 
Concourse tomorrow night.

Pulse and all kinds of good

good shape. 

A good new album is Joan 
Baez "Any Day Now" an album 
essentially dedicated to Bob 
Dylan. They were together for 
quite a while and his song "She 
belongs to Me" is written about 
her. This seems to be an album 
to show her old love for .him,

:**************** The scientific work conducted 
at Scripps Ins titution of Oceano-
graphy Is being seriously ham-
pered by pe r mitting board surf-
ing In the area. There have been 
sever al near accidents to our 
diver s and, in addition, there has 
been a tremendous acceleration 
01 complaints from many sources 
concer ning the su rfing activities. 
In an attempt to con trol this 
s ituation, Director Nierenberg 
this past summer restr icted 
surfing to Unlvers1ty employees 
in a designated area between the 
hour s of 12 noon and 2 p.m .. It 
has now been reported to me that 
it has been impossible to re-
strict the area to UC employees 
and that the ar ea near the SIO 
pier is indeed dange rous. Under 
the Cir cumstances, I have no al-
ternative but to prohibit board 
surfing in University controlled 
water s. 

This action will become ef-
fective concurrently with the 
placement of appropriate signs 
on the beach. These signs will 
clear ly indicate the areas so 
affected and will state that vio-
lator s will be prosecuted in ac-
cordance with applicable state 
and municipal code provisions.

Playtex·invents the first-day tampon™ 
(We took the inside out 
to show you how different it is.) 
Outside: it's softer and silky (not cardboardy). 
Inside: it's so extra absorbent ... it even protects on 
your first day. Your worst day! 

In every lab test against the old cardboardy kind ... 
the Playtex tampon was always more absorbent. 
Actually 45 % more absorbent on the average 
than the leading regular tampon. 

Because it's different. Actually adjusts to you. 
It flowers out. Fluffs out. Designed to protect every 
inside inch of you. So the chance of a mishap 
is almost zerol 
Try it fast. ~ p
