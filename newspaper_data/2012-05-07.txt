UCSD 
Names 
a New 
Chancellor

BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG 
Staff Writer

Pradeep K. Khosla, dean of 
Carnegie Mellon University’s College 
of Engineering, will be the eighth 
chancellor of 
UCSD, UC 
P r e s i d e n t 
Mark G. Yudof 
a n n o u n c e d 
May 3. 
C h a n c e l l o r 
Marye Anne 
Fox, who 
announced her 
resignation on 
July 5, 2011, 
will continue serving until the UC 
Board of Regents confirms its final 
decision at the May 16 meeting.

Yudof said that Khosla emerged 
as the top candidate after the interna-
tional search. The search committee, 
comprised of faculty, Regents and 
students, took eight months to inter-
view prospective chancellors. 

“[Pradeep Khosla is an] oft-hon-
ored researcher, an innovative educa-
tor dedicated to improving the qual-
ity of life for students, faculty and 
staff and an entrepreneurial leader 
with a global vision and proven fun-
draising abilities,” Yudof said in a 
press release. 

Outgoing Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox’s eight years at UCSD are high-
lighted by the improvement of uni-
versity infrastructure and increased 
funding and prestige of UCSD aca-
demics and research. As the Guardian 
reported back in October, Fox plans 
to return to teaching and spending 
time with her family. 

Khosla is the Philip and Marsha 
Dowd University Professor of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering 
and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon, 
where he has initiated several under-
graduate curriculum reforms. 

According to the press release, 
he implemented successful diversity 
efforts, multidisciplinary and multi-
college research centers, multidisci-
plinary graduate offerings and start-
ed international programs in Japan, 
Korea, Portugal, China and Rwanda. 
Khosla’s leadership resulted in larger 
numbers of women and minorities 

Ron Paul Draws 
Crowd of  Nearly 6,000

By margaret yau • Managing Editor

Republican presidential can-didate and congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas) spoke 
to approximately 5,600 spectators 
at Warren Mall last Friday. The 
group UCSD Students for Ron 
Paul, chaired by president Elizabeth 
Goodrich, brought Paul to campus 
on Friday, May 4.

After a brief introduction, a 
black SUV pulled up to Warren Mall 
and the crowd exploded in cheers of 
“President Paul.” 

During the speech, Paul stressed 
the need for the country to return to 

its Constitutional values. 
“Our job is great too, it’s a 

major task to change this coun-
try around because we have been 
drifting from our original intent of 
our Constitution, and the problems 
began a long time before you were 
born and unfortunately, you as a 
generation are inheriting it,” Paul 
said. “The burden will fall on you to 
change things.”

During his speech, Paul spoke 
about his libertarian values. 
Libertarianism is a political stance  
that values freedom from govern-

mental power and individual liber-
ties. 

“Liberty doesn’t come because 
you are part of a group,” Paul said. 
“You don’t get liberty from being a 
hyphenated American. You have lib-
erty because you have a right to your 
life, you have a right to your liberty 
and you have the right to keep all 
the fruits of your labor.”

According to Goodrich, UCSD 
Students for Ron Paul solicited over 
1,000 signatures on Library Walk 
this past October to bring Paul to 
campus. 

Soon after, the campaign con-
tacted Goodrich about including 
UCSD on Paul’s California cam-
paign tour. Paul’s campaign also 
stopped at UCLA, UC Berkeley 
and several state schools this week. 
Goodrich said that Friday’s event, 
excluding the cost of transporting 
Paul to campus, cost approximate-
ly $4,000. According to Goodrich, 
Paul’s own campaign funds sup-
ported the event. 

Goodrich said that the event was

Israeli Foreign Minister Daniel 
Ayalon delivered a talk on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, nuclear prolifera-
tion and the Arab Spring movement at 
Price Center Theater on May 3. 

Ayalon has been acting as Deputy 
Foreign Minister, one of the most 
senior positions in the Israeli cabi-
net, since March 29, 2009. As Deputy 
Foreign Minister, Ayalon is responsible 
for promoting economic, cultural and 
scientific ties between Israel and other 
nations. Before that, he served as the 
Israeli ambassador to the United States. 

Ayalon discussed Israel’s goals in its 
relationships to neighboring countries.

“Israel would like to have peace 
—  a true peace — with all its neigh-

bors,” Ayalon said. “For us, peace is 
not just a piece of paper. It is an act of 
recognition and acceptance. We have 
been offering that.” 

Ayalon asked his audience mem-
bers to look to the publicly available 
Oslo agreements of 1993 as proof. 

“If you check the offers, you’ll see 
that [Israel] has come 95 percent of 
the way,” he said. “Palestine has not 
budged an inch.” 

Palestinian scholars, such as Saree 
Makdisi, have argued that the Oslo 
Accords were heavily biased in favor of 
Israel to begin with. 

Ayalon said he was optimistic 
about foreign relations because it was 
his responsibility to be as a leader. He 
said that it was important for Israel to 
focus on building other allies in the 
Middle East, rather than focusing on a 

state “that will not, in a thousand years, 
recognize Israel as a nation.” 

“We should look for solutions,” he 
said. “We should not look at it as a 
zero-sum game.” 

Tritons for Israel, a campus organi-
zation that has also arranged for other 
Israeli speakers to speak at UCSD, 
coordinated the Ayalon event. 

TFI President Daniel Friedman 
said his group felt that it was neces-
sary to sponsor speakers like Ayalon 
because of the divestment resolutions 
that have been brought before A.S. 
Council in recent years. The resolution 
asks the council to support divesting, 
or withdrawing money from, compa-
nies that provide war technology used 
by the Israeli Defense Forces in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Friedman said that reserving Price 

Center Theater, where the event was 
held, was the most difficult aspect 
of event planning. Campus security, 
Israeli security and representatives 
from the State Department took care 
of security, scheduling and logistics. 

“There was a lot of coordination 
between the different teams involved,” 
Friedman said. “At UCSD, it all started 
four years ago when a resolution was 
brought to condemn Israel, and divest 
from a couple of Israeli companies 
who did business with the national 
military.”

Friedman received day and time 
confirmation of the event on April 
11  from Israeli security. From there, 
TFI had three-and-a-half weeks to pre-
pare the event, and began planning

immediately. TFI used its own funds 
to pay for all the costs, the biggest of 
which was security. Security cost a few 
thousand dollars, Friedman said. Box 
office and videotaping were roughly 
$400 each. 

Friedman said that he had been 
worried about the possibility of a 
disruption like the one at UC Irvine 
in 2010, during the visit of Israeli 
Ambassador Michael Oren. 

Oren also came to speak at UCSD, 
but there was not a similar disruption 
here. During Oren’s speech at Irvine, 
11 students stood up, one by one, 
to shout statements like “propagating 
murder is not an expression of free 

speech.” 
 Ten of the later-dubbed “Irvine 11” 

were found guilty by a California jury 
for the misdemeanor of disrupting free 
speech. 

“It was such a mess,” he said. “We 
were bracing ourselves for something 
like that here.” 

Before Ayalon came to the stage, 
Friedman remarked that the campus 
had witnessed acts of intolerance in 
the past. “If someone harangues the 
speaker, then we reserve the right to 
move them out.”

The event went without interrup-
tion and as planned.

enrolling at the engineering school.
Khosla spearheaded a $100-mil-

lion fundraising campaign at 
Carnegie Mellon. The campaign used 
federal government, foundation and 
alumni resources to construct an 
energy institute and raise $90 million 
for a new biotech, energy and nano-
tech engineering building.

Khosla is an active member of 
the Pittsburgh community, where 
he serves on the board of several 
non-profits, including The Children’s 
Institute, IIT Foundation and the 
Pittsburgh Technology Council.

“UC San Diego’s astounding 
growth and success are due in large 
part to its history of partnership with 
and support from the San Diego 
community,” Yudof said in the press 
release. “Pradeep understands the 
importance of these connections and 
will foster and expand them.”

Khosla graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon with M.S. and Ph.D. degrees 
in electrical and computer engineer-
ing. He grew up in Mumbai, India, 
where he received a bachelor’s degree 
in electrical engineering from the 
Indian Institute of Technology. 

“In slightly more than 50 years, 
UC San Diego, under the leadership 
of Marye Anne Fox and her predeces-
sors, has become one of the world’s 
top universities,” Khosla said in the 
press release. “I feel fortunate, hum-
bled and energized to have the oppor-
tunity to contribute to that excellence 
while embracing the challenges of 
integrating world-class research with 
an undergraduate educational experi-
ence.”

Yudof and Khosla have no further 
information or comments until after 
the confirmation date of May 16.

successful.
“I honestly believe that it was 

one of the most successful rallies 
we’ve had,” Goodrich said. “We had 
400 new Republican registrations 
last night, which is many, many 
more than they typically get at these 
types of rallies.” 

A coalition that included stu-
dents, the Public Education Coalition 
and members of the public protested 
Paul’s speech. The students organized 
through a Facebook event called 
“Protest Ron Paul Speech at UCSD.” 
According to Public Education 
Coalition member Nikolai Smith, 
about 30 students showed up in pro-
test. 

“I think it is important to chal-
lenge anybody that comes who is 
trying to advocate the privatization 
of universities,” Smith said. “Our 
university has seen its fees go up, as 
our university is becoming priva-
tized, so we are there to fight back.”

The coalition handed out pam-
phlets detailing their disagreements 
with Paul’s beliefs. 

The pamphlets  also stated 
the PEC’s efforts to prevent the 
University of California from 
becoming a privatized system. 

“Just being out there, having 
many faculty and staff members 
approach us and thank us for being 
there, for providing sort of an 
alternate presence — that was very 
good,” Smith said.

Paul currently has 83 delegates. 
He would need 1,144 delegates to 
secure the Republican nomination.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, MAY 7,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

To escape the rain, a couple colleagues and I hit Porter’s pub, one of the many treasures 
hidden within the Old Student Center. 
They have beers that fight cancer, 
but you’ll have to make the best anti-
cancer beers yourself. 

Once we arrived, I bought the 
darkest and heaviest beer possible, a 
Stone Imperial Russian Stout.

A lot of people don’t like hoppy 
or dark beers because of their strong, 
bitter or roasty taste. Instead, they 
prefer generic sissy lagers that taste 
like water. Of course, there’s nothing 
wrong with that. I can appreciate a 
good light beer. But there’s something 
in these rich, robust flavored brews 
that you should really know about. 

Within these carefully crafted 
microbrews is a compound derived 
from flowering hops, Xanthohumol 
(XN), that is chemoprotective, anti-
inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic. 
Almost 200 scientific papers have 
been published on this compound 
and how it is a natural therapeutic for 
breast cancer, prostate cancer, stomach 
cancer, liver cancer, leukemia, 
neuroprotection, liver inflammation, 
etc. Many of the pioneering studies 
came out of Germany, one of the 
major beer countries of the world.

Originally, hops were added to 
beer as a preservative. The India 
Pale Ale (IPA) had a significantly 
larger amount of hops to prevent 
beer spoilage while on the ocean 
voyage from England to India. Now, 
brewers just add hops for the taste and 
stabilization. 

Because of the brewing process, 
you can’t drink enough XN in a 
regular beer for it to be therapeutic. 
When the grains and hops are boiled, 
the most therapeutic form, XN, is 
converted into a less therapeutic form, 
isoXN. What a waste.

In 2005, a German scientist took 
a break from his regular biochemical 
and biomedical research to develop a 
method to brew a beer with 20 times 
greater XN than regular beer.  What 
he figured out was that the hoppiest 
beers don’t actually contain the most 
XN. Instead, dark beers that contain 
roasted barley, such as stouts and 
porters, actually had the highest 
amount of XN in them. It’s believed 
that the roasted malt extracts uniquely 
contain “heavier” compounds that 
bind XN and protect it from the 
conversion to isoXN during boiling.

The literature states that dark beers 
(like the Imperial Russian Stout) can 
get up to roughly 20 percent as much 
XN as the beer that Wunderlich (the 
German scientist) created. But if you 
want to make a beer with as much 
XN as he did, you’re going to have to 
make it yourself. 

Obviously there are homebrew 
kits available online, and YouTube 
is an excellent resource. But keep in 
mind that you are at UCSD. Porter’s 
pub at UCSD hosts a home brew club 
that meets and brews a couple times 
a month. Within our community, we 
should have all the tools necessary to 
brew the most potent cancer-fighting 
beer possible.

In an ongoing struggle to balance dining 
hall hours and its budget, the Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality (HDH) staff and the 
Undergraduate On-Campus Housing and 
Dining Advisory Committee decided on Feb. 
27 to close down Ocean View Terrace (OVT) 
and Plaza on the weekends starting Fall 2012. 
Closing a couple dining halls is a strong 
financial move (fewer total operating hours in 
the school year), considering a small minority 
of students eat there on the weekends anyway. 

These two dining halls will also open 30 
minutes earlier and close an hour later on 
weekdays. However, 39 percent of students 
eat at Pines on the weekends according to 
HDH Executive Director Mark Cunningham, 
implying that a majority of students from 
Revelle already choose to eat at a dining hall 
other than Plaza. This is an apt financial 
move for the school because most students 
have options to go to other dining halls other 
than the one in their college, which they 
apparently often enjoy more.

This move will allow HDH to cut down 
on the costs of extra electricity, staff and 
surpluses of food by opening for fewer 
total hours. The closures also will not affect 
demand on the weekdays. Students will still 
be able to go to these two dining halls during 
the week, and since the demand is far less on 
the weekends, HDH will reap many benefits 
from their decision.

Ultimately, the benefits of more hours 
during the week for OVT and Plaza Cafe 
outweigh the costs of them closing down on 
the weekends.

QUICK TAKES BEGINNING FALL 2012, PLAZA CAFE AND OCEAN VIEW TERRACE WILL CLOSE ON WEEKENDS IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE MONEY, BUT BOTH DINING HALLS ALONG WITH FOODWORX WILL HAVE EXTENDED WEEKDAY HOURS.

Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services 
(HDH) will soon close two dining halls on 
weekends, while extending weekday hours. 
Closing Plaza and Ocean View Terrace during 
slow hours may be fiscally favorable, but the 
creation of new inconvenient “specialty” dining 
locations is counterproductive.

Recently, various dining locations like 
Roots, The Bistro, Club Med and the brand 
new Café 88 have opened across campus, 
featuring modern architecture and unique 
dishes — but limited hours of service. These 
places aren’t as useful to students as the main 
dining halls. Roots, for example, serves vegan 
food that only appeals to a certain portion of 
the campus population. And while the Bistro 
is a nice luxury, it is also an unnecessary one. 
Furthermore, none of these sites are open on 
weekends, and all close in the early afternoon 
on Fridays. These sites are inconvenient for 
students because of their minimal hours and 
locations on the outskirts of the main campus.

Constructing specialty dining locations has 
cost HDH thousands of dollars — Roots itself 
cost over $790,000 to build. If HDH is at such 
a loss that it must resort to closing a couple 
of dining halls completely on the weekends, 
it should not be investing money into new, 
limited dining ventures. Specialty dining halls 
are not vital and are viewed by students as only 
a substitute to the main campus dining halls. 

HDH may be in a strap for cash, but it needs 
to reevaluate how it is allocating its funds. 
Refraining from building specialty dining 
locations is a lot wiser than cutting funds from 
the dining halls that already exist.

Beginning Fall 2012, Ocean View Terrace 
and Plaza will be closed on weekends in order 
to extend their weekday hours without raising 
prices on food. Though slightly inconvenient for 
students living in Revelle and Marshall, there are 
still quality options available to them as long as 
the dining halls and markets nearby are able to 
compensate for the extra influx of students they 
will receive on weekends.

Marshall students are most opportunely 
located for next year’s closure. Not only are 
they positioned between two full-service dining 
halls, Pines and Café Ventanas, but they will also 
still have the luxury of the open-late Goody’s 
within the boundaries of their own college. 
Unfortunately, it’s mostly Revelle students who 
will get the short end of the stick in Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality’s new plan. Besides 
Roger’s Place and Market (which doesn’t serve hot 
items), the only dining hall close to them is Pines. 

The weekend closures will not be a big deal 
as long as the remaining dining halls, especially 
the ever-popular Pines, make accommodations 
to handle the increased numbers of students 
over the weekends. More staff will need to be 
scheduled for the weekend to make sure lines 
stay short, and fresh food remains readily 
available. It’s common knowledge that because 
dining halls have less traffic on the weekends, 
food can end up sitting under heat lamps for 
longer than they should have to be. An effort to 
improve the quality of food options on weekends 
must happen. As long as accommodations are 
made, walking a little extra to the next closest 
dining hall will only be a minor inconvenience to 
most students.

Students Will Need Weekend Options Closures are Smart Financial MoveTime to Stop Opening New Food Places

On Friday, April 4, Christian student group Acts2Fellowship held 
a lecture on using logic when 
approaching religion, titled 
“Coexist?” in Center Hall. Despite 
its confusing advertising, the 

talk was a polite appeal for 
students to be thoughtful 

and logical rather than 
an attempt to preach the 

supremacy of a single religion. 
This event brings up the 

overarching need for UCSD 
to facilitate more discussion 
of religion in a scholarly way, 

since it is such an integral part of 
students’ lives.  

The way it was designed, 
the advertising for the event 

likely confused students 
about its intent. Posters 

depicted the word “COEXIST” 
written out in religious symbols 
and the provocative question 
“Are all religions equally true?” 
This can be easily interpreted 
as a promotion of Christianity 
as the truest religion. Such a 
suggestion would be enough to 
make students of other faiths 
uncomfortable — especially since 
Christians constitute the single 
largest religious group on campus. 
In order avoid confusions like 
this, A2F could team up with 
other religious orgs next time to 
reach a broader audience and 
convey an unbiased view. 

Despite these misconceptions, 
Kim did not argue for or against 
any particular religion in his 
speech. Rather, he argued that 
belief in multiple religions 

was a logical impossibility. He 
pointed out that one could not 
believe in both Christianity and 
Buddhism, because Christianity’s 
tenets are theism, afterlife, 
and involvement, whereas the 
tenets of Buddhism are atheism, 
reincarnation, and detachment 
— exact opposites. Kim said 
it was not his place to judge 
which religion was absolutely 
correct. Rather, his purpose in 
pointing out the incompatibility 
of various religions was to guard 
against what he calls “buffet-
line religion” which means you 
can’t create a god as an image of 
yourself because then you won’t 
grow spiritually. Kim’s reasoned, 
intellectual consideration of the 
issues leading to his dismissal of 
religious syncretism is admirable, 

The lack of  religious diversity at Acts2Fellowship’s intellectual lecture event 
called “Coexist” indicates a need for educational religious dialogue at UCSD.

Dear Editor,
For-profit colleges account for 10 

percent of students but 45 percent 
of defaults on loan repayment; 
first, separate the criminal, the 
merely bogus, the inadequate...
or if that can’t be done...just stop 
giving out money upfront to CEOs 
of educational corporations. Stop 
student aid to students at religious 
institutions. Two, do something bad 
to those on-line entrepreneurs who 
make money hand over fist from GIs 
and their dependents under robust 
and transferable Post-9/11 education 
benefits. Criminalize campaign 
donations to elected officials from 
CEOs at for-profit colleges who 
take millions in stock options and/
or pay for Super Bowl TV ads. Kick 
Dick Blum off the University of 
California Board of Regents. Kick his 
wife Dianne Feinstein out of the U.S.

Dear Editor, 
I sympathize with Mr. Ashton 

Cohen’s recent issues involving a 
picture posted on Facebook. It sucks 
that some people misinterpreted the 
photo of him. After all, I’m sure he 
had good (if still unexplained) reasons 
for thinking that the clothes he 
bought in Dubai were a great costume 
choice. But it also sucks that there are 
lots of racist caricatures of Arabs out 
there that might lead some to jump 
to conclusions. It sucks that we often 
hold public figures, even those just in 
student government, under scrutiny 

and that his name got dragged 
through the mud. But it also sucks 
that less privileged individuals often 
feel like public officials and let them 
down. It sucks that his Muslim friend 
who posted the photo was shocked 
at its reception. But it also sucks that 
others’ Muslim friends were shocked 
at its content. It sucks that people 
who disagree with him on the topic of 
Israel politicized a presumably honest 
mistake. But it also sucks that, for 
many of the less privileged, daily life 
is highly political. And it sucks that 
he was intimidated by the checkpoint 
simulation on Library Walk. But it 
also sucks that some people have to 
live in a police state.

I am reminded of the aftermath 
of 9/11. I think the first reaction of 
the majority of the American people, 
anger, was natural and reasonable. 
The second response, the desire to 
retaliate, while perhaps still natural, 
was far less reasonable. It has led to 
a never-ending “War on Terror,” far 
more deaths and the monstrosity 
of Guantanamo. Might a more 
reasonable second response have been 
to ask ourselves what we have done 
to provoke the enmity of much of the 
Middle East? Perhaps they also feel 
like they must retaliate for something? 
Maybe we should try to understand 
why that is before continuing the cycle 
of violence.

SOLVE FOR X By Philip Jia

Public Desire to Retaliate 
Needs to be Reevaluated

not offensive.
Indeed, lively intellectual 

discussion of the religious issues that 
bind members of the campus of all 
faiths is exactly what UCSD needs 
to promote greater understanding 
among the different ethnic and 
religious groups on campus. A 2011 
cross-sectional study by John White 
and Patrick Lowenthal on academic 
discourse and religion published in 
the Review of Higher Education found 
that religious discourse is essential for 
campus unity, especially in campuses 
that are ethnically and culturally 
diverse. More Kim-style lectures 
are exactly what this campus needs. 
Our campus — 24 percent white, 49 
percent Asian, 14 percent Latino, with 
61 individual ethnic clubs and 83 

individual religious organizations — is 
incredibly diverse. But there is a real 
risk of insularism on a campus with 
so many small groups. It is perfectly 
possible to go through four years here 
without interacting with anyone too 
differently-minded.

Talks like Kim’s may even have 
a quantifiably positive effect on the 
student body, if implemented more 
widely. According to the 2009 study, 
“Teenagers’ Perspectives on the Role 
of Religion in Their Lives” conducted 
by researcher Pille Vilk, college 
students who have learned about 
religious diversity as a part of their 
education are more tolerant, and more 
open to dialogue on religious issues. 
To this end, more speaker events like 
Kim’s should be paired with more 
opportunities for students to learn 

about religions on campus. There are 
no fewer than 176 courses offered by 
the Religion Department at UCSD 
focused on Buddhism, Christianity, 
Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, 
Judaism and Taoism, as well as 
smaller traditions — there should 
be something for students of all 
backgrounds and interests.

To prevent misunderstandings 
and increase unity among students, 
campus religious organizations should 
take steps to educate people of all 
belief systems. If it does, it will have 
something truly incredible on its 
hands — a means for UCSD students 
to learn to approach religion in a 
reasonable, logical way.

S
un God Festival is a time 
when UCSD’s notoriously 
well-behaved student pop-
ulation participates in the 
rowdy behavior typical of 

the average college campus. So it’s in 
preparation of all the write-ups that  
will inevitably come with this celebra-
tion that the A.S. Office of Student 
Advocacy and the A.S. Judicial board 
will spend Week 7 distributing pam-
phlets titled, “Know Your Rights & 
UCSD Student Conduct Code.”

The pamphlet gives advice to 
students in situations involving law 
enforcement, advising students “don’t 
lie,” “do show ID” and “do make sure 
an officer knows you do not agree to 
be searched,” instructing that even if 
you still get searched, that “you make 
your opposition known.”

Bryce Farrington, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College student and vice 
president of student advocacy, works 
with 12 other student advocates 
under the Associated Students Office 

of the President to represent students 
in disciplinary hearings and other 
issues relating to the UCSD Student 
Conduct Code, which is currently 
under revision.

When a student feels they have 
the grounds to protest the sanctions 
held against them by administration, 
student advocacy is one place they 
can go.

“If the student doesn’t want to 
accept responsibility, they go through 
a formal hearing process and that’s in 
front of a judicial board or an admin-
istrative review,” Farrington said. 
“Normally the director of student 
conduct and that process will decide 
whether or not they’re responsible.”

Throughout the year, the Office of 
Student Advocacy handles both aca-
demic cases, in which a student has 
been accused of breaking the Student 
Code of Academic Integrity, as well 
as non-academic cases that include 
violations of the Student Code of 
Conduct, the comprehensive set of 

rules that govern student behavior 
at UCSD. 

Among the non-academic cases, 
Farrington estimates that about nine 
out of 10 of the ones the office of 
student advocacy works with are 
alcohol-related. In cases in which a 
student is accused of breaking the 
Student Conduct Code, the residen-
tial dean of the college that student 
attends then issues a set of sanctions 
for the student in question, such as 
being put on academic probation, or 
attending a seminar.

According to Farrington, many 
students aren’t aware of the fact that 
they don’t always have to accept the 
dean’s sanctions. 

Farrington says that this year, 
however, has had an especially high 
number of non-academic cases reach-
ing the advocacy board — this could 
be attributed to recent efforts by the

M arshall transfer student Sean Couey always has his camera on hand. Since the onset of 
his street-style website, showmeUC-
SD, Couey has been ready at any time 
to capture the fashion that spruces up 
the reputably dull campus of UCSD. 

Launched about two weeks ago, 
his website already documents a 
growing collection of the diverse 
styles and trends that are being sport-
ed across campus — from the aisles 
of Geisel to the forest of Eucalyptus 
trees. So far, 25 students have been 
featured in snapshots with brief cap-
tions detailing their outfits, some 
wearing unique thrift store finds and 
accessories with others dressed in 
vibrant colors and patterns.

Couey, an economics major from 
Cupertino, was inspired by the street-
style blogs that he frequents daily, 
like The Sartorialist, and thought, 
“Wouldn’t it be cool if we had one for 
UCSD?”

But before that, it was his study 
abroad trip to Milan in 2009 that first 
triggered his eye for fashion.

“People there just take a lot of 

time and put a lot of effort into what 
they’re wearing and how they present 
themselves, so it really shows,” Couey 
said. “Walking down the street, you 
can tell everyone purposefully dress-
es a certain way, and everything in 
their look is just so. Even the little 
details are really planned out.”

From his exposure to Milan’s noto-
rious fashion scene, Couey developed 
his personal take on fashion as a 
deliberate form of self-expression, or 
in his own words, a visual resume. 

“It’s a good way to let people know 
who you are because a lot of times, 
you don’t have the chance to meet 
people and have a face-to-face con-
versation with them; the only thing 
you have is that you see them visually 
passing by,” Couey said.

He noted how anyone can simply 
throw on sweatpants and a sweatshirt 
(admittedly a culprit of this himself), 
which is why he appreciates those 
who put forth the effort to express 
themselves through a certain aes-
thetic style, whatever style that may 
be.  

“There isn’t a particular style that 

I really gravitate to; it’s just whenever 
I see something that I find interest-
ing,” Couey said. “I’m always looking 
for new styles, and I love people who 
are already confident in the way that 
they’re dressing. It really shows in the 
pictures.”

With his previous experience of 
keeping personal blogs, including 
one about the mechanics of mopeds, 
Couey claimed that it wasn’t too dif-
ficult to get his website started. But 
he acknowledges the input of fellow 
UCSD students, such as his room-
mate, Sixth College junior and com-
puter science major Dennis Chen, 
who helped him put together the 
website.

Couey hopes that showmeUCSD 
will soon catch on.

“I told my friend the other day 
that my dream is to be in class, sitting 
in the back row, and I look down to 
see someone’s computer open and 
they’re looking at my website,” Couey 
said.

office of Student Conduct in directing 
students to the Office of Advocacy 
when they feel that they have grounds 
to contest their sanctions.

“A majority of our cases are still 
academic,” Farrington said. “It used 
to be probably 80 percent academic 
and 20 percent non-academic and 
now that’s getting a little bit close to 
even. There’s been a four or five fold 
increase in non-academic cases this 
year.”

The administration has also tried 
to implement more training to ensure 
more uniformity throughout campus 
law enforcement, but according to 
Farrington, the experience you have 
with law enforcement will still differ 
significantly depending on the college 
you live in.

According to Farrington, the cur-
rent director of student conduct, Ben 
White, is working to centralize the 
disciplinary process, and gets along 
pretty well with the current board of 
advocates — something he said “is 
not always the case.”

 “Our perspective is very different 
from the perspective of the admin-
istration and it has often been very 
much at odds with the administra-
tion,” Farrington said.

 One of the issues is the highly 
bureaucratic nature of the entire pro-
cess, which includes administrators 
from multiple departments. A large 
part of the job of a student advocate is 
simply to decipher the tricky protocol 

behind disciplinary action, as well as 
the Student Code of Conduct, which 
outlines rights for students.

  “There’s just multiple layers from 
the first notification. If you are an 
18- or 19-year-old student and this is 
your first encounter with discipline 
at an institutional level, you have 
to go meet your dean [and] there’s 
multiple pages of email that are going 
to go back and forth in the process,” 
Farrington said. “It might not be 
clear to you as the student what your 
options are. A lot of students don’t 
realize that when they meet with 
the dean they don’t have to accept 
responsibility.”

 Farrington also notes a lack of 
accountability from the administra-
tion.

 “We find it very problematic 
when we have a student that was 
written up by an RSO and we go 
through the entire process of the judi-
cial board hearing and when we go to 
the hearing, the RSO who reported 
the violation doesn’t even show up,” 
Farrington said. “The hearing still 
goes forward, even though we had 
questions for the RSO if the RSO’s 
story didn’t make any sense. That 
happens a lot actually.”

 Even among the different col-
leges, Farrington explained, imple-
mentation of discipline varies greatly, 
as certain deans and RSOs are more 
inclined to exercise disciplinary 
action than others.

 “The administration has a huge 

amount of power to sanction stu-
dents. You want to see that be treated 
with a lot of responsibility,” he said.

 Students can, and are urged to 
by the Office of Student Advocacy, to 
understand their rights and the rules 
of residential life by reading the con-
duct code at revisedcode.ucsd.edu.

 While the rules of student con-
duct are administrative regulations 
and are separate from state and feder-
al laws, Farrington says that constitu-
tional rights still apply to on-campus 
situations. For example, search and 
seizure is not allowed without rea-
son — but any evidence of alcohol 
consumption or an “unsafe” living 
condition can warrant such search 
and seizure.

 The Office of Student Advocacy 
is limited to issues regarding the code 
itself. Often, non-academic cases will 
entail violations of state and federal 
law, which would fall under the juris-
diction of Student Legal Services.

 “Student legal services does a ton 
of great stuff about rent, parking and 
fines,” Farrington said.

No residential deans, represen-
tatives from the Office of Student 
Conduct, or from the department of 
Residential Security could be reached 
for comment.

Advocacy at asadvocacy@ucsd.edu or

address present the strategic logic for U.S. immigration 
policy by identifying three general categories of security 
objectives that American officials have attempted to 
reach with immigration from the colonial era to the 
present-day: (1) foreign relations, (2) material and 
military interests, and (3) domestic security (prevent 
crime, espionage, and terrorism; epidemics; and ethnic 
violence). For more info, contact Peggy Chang at 
pechang@ucsd.edu or 858-822-0526. Presented by the 
Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at UC San 
Diego.

FREDDIE GIBBS WITH ALIER AND THE BAND - 
THE LOFT
Freddie has worked with respected producers like Statik 
Selektah, DJ Burn One, Cardo, Big K.R.I.T., Block Beattaz 
and Lil Lody among many others. Gibbs' influences from 
Houston rap and Pac manifest in his ability to alternate 
between chillingly tense street stories of violence and 
laid back comedic tales about women and weed. 
Ultimately Gibbs shows and proves with his rhymes, 
which demonstrate the promise of a legend in the 
making. His skills, wit, and street credibility establish 
Freddie Gibbs as a true artist. He represents the 
Midwest, and anyone who relates to the struggle of 
inner city life.

allowing only four hits.
UCSD went up 1–0 in the first 

inning, but collected three more runs 
in the fourth inning to secure the win. 
With Portugal on third and sophomore 
Emily McQuaid on second, Lesovsky 
singled for one RBI. McQuaid and 
Lesovsky were both brought home off 
a single by sophomore cleanup hitter 
Charly Swanberg. 

GAME 3
Stuck in a win-or-go-home 

situation, the No. 24 Tritons knocked 
second-seed CSU Monterey Bay out 
of the national tournament on their 
home field, in the semifinal game.

Sophomore All-CCAA second 
team selection Caitlin Brown 
recorded two solo home runs, while 
Lesovsky went yard in the top of the 
fifth inning for two RBI to cement a 
5–0 win.

UCSD first got on the board in the 
third inning, as McQuaid scored on a 
throwing error and Brown collected 
her first home run off of Monterey 

pitcher Kylie Linnane.
In the top of the fifth inning, 

with one out and one on, Lesovsky 
homered down the leftfield line to put 
the Tritons up 4–0. Brown’s homer in 
her third at bat secured the win for 
the Tritons.

 
GAME 4

UCSD took an early 2–0 lead in 
the top of the second inning, as Dixie 
State pitcher Mattie Snow walked the 
Tritons’ next two batters.

Snow was relieved in favor of 
pitcher Lauren Folta, who allowed the 
Tritons only two hits in her subsequent 
five innings. With the score still 2–0, 
Brown came up big with a solo home 
run in the seventh inning to go up 
3–0. The run was enough to stave 
off the Red Storm, who tallied two 
runs in their last turn at the plate. 
 

GAME 5
The Tritons took the West Regional 

championship in five innings against 
the Red Storm in the second game of 
the double header. 

Lesovsky collected an RBI in the 
top of the second inning to give UCSD 
a 1–0 lead. With Sykes on second and 
McQuaid on first, Lesovsky singled 
down the leftfield line to bring Sykes 
into score. McQuaid was moved over 
on a throwing error, and stole home to 
put the Tritons up 2–0. 

Red Storm pitcher Michelle 
Duncan found herself in a tight spot 
with bases loaded — Lesovsky on 
third, hitting Willmon with a pitch 
to put her on second and walking 
Brown—the right-hander gave up 
another run on a single by Swanberg. 

The Tritons loaded the bases in the 
fourth inning, picking up two runs as 
Duncan walked Romero and Sykes. 
With the 5–0 advantage, Portugal 
was brought up to bat. The freshman 
notched her first career home run and 
grand slam to put the Tritons up 9–0. 

UCSD picked up another 
run in the fifth inning to end 
the game on the mercy rule.

First-Seeded UCSD to Host CCAAs
conference sweep. 

 
GAME 1

UCSD took the first of the two 
game series, with a 6-1 win on Friday 
behind a strong game from the 
Triton bullpen. Junior starter Ryan 
Goodbrand (9-0) went five innings, 
allowing just two hits, while senior 
right-hander Elias Tuma logged his 
third save, throwing three strikeouts 
in his 1.1 innings pitched.

The game remained tied 1-1 until 
the fifth inning when the Tritons 
capitalized on two Grand Canyon 
errors to go up 2-1.

UCSD doubled the lead in its next 
turn in the box, as sophomore des-
ignated hitter Nick La Face recorded 
his fourth homerun of the season, to 
extend the lead to 4-1. 

La Face picked up another RBI in 
the bottom of the seventh inning to 
score junior Danny Susdorf.

 
GAME 2

UCSD went down 4-0 in the hole 
as the Antelopes tallied six hits in the 
first two innings. 

The Tritons would not get on the 
board until the bottom of the fourth 
inning off a triple from senior Gregg 
Ringold. 

Grand Canyon went up 6-1 in the 
fifth inning off a double for one RBI. 
With one out and men on third and 
first, junior Richard Kilbury came 
in to relieve sophomore Justin Rahn. 

Kilbury gave up a run, walking 
two men, before he was able to work 
his way out of the inning. 

The Tritons took two more back 
off consecutive doubles with La Face 
and senior Jeff Rauh, but Grand 
Canyon closed the game out with 
four runs on a grand slam from PJ 
Garcia.

BASEBALL — Last week, April 
26 to 28, the UCSD baseball team 
clinched a share of the regular 
season CCAA title with a series 
split with Cal State Los Angeles.  
Ending the season with a 26-14 con-
ference record, the Tritons share the 
conference crown with 26-14 Chico 
State.

The Tritons played their last 
games of the regular season, Friday 
and Saturday, May 4 and 5, split-
ting two non-conference games with 
Grand Canyon University. 

The Tritons now have one week 
to prepare for the conference tourna-
ment, to be held at Triton Ballpark 
this Thursday through Saturday, May 
10 to 12. 

The double elimination tourna-
ment will feature the top four finish-
ers from around the conference: first-
seed UCSD, second-seed Chico State, 

third-seed Cal State San Bernardino 
and fourth-seed Sonoma State. 

The Tritons’ first game is set 
for this Thursday, May 10 at 7 p.m. 
against Sonoma State.

with the Seawolves was back in April,

After taking the CCAA title to claim an automatic bid for the NCAA Division II West 
Regionals, UCSD has punched their 
ticket to the Super Regional round to 
be held this weekend May 11 to May 
12 on the campus of CSU Dominguez 
Hills. 

Going into the tournament with 
the sixth-seed, the Tritons topped 
CCAA regular season champions 
second-seed CSU Monterey Bay as 
well as third-seed Dixie State en route 
to the West Region crown.

“We felt strong going in even 
against the teams we hadn’t seen 
this year,” UCSD head coach Patti 
Gerckens said. “All three teams were 
very difficult, but we believed that we 
would come out.”

The No. 24 Tritons will be one 
of 16 teams to advance to the Super 
Regional competition, where UCSD 
will face CCAA squad No. 10 CSU 
Dominguez Hills. 

The Tritons took down the first-
seeded Toros 1–0 in the opening 
game of the conference tournament 
on April 27. 

“The postseason brings out a 
different animal in everybody,” 

Gerckens said. “For us right now I 
think that we’re playing really well. 
We’re trying to focus on doing the little 
things right, and at this point in the 
season, the teams that do that are going 
to be the teams that come out on top.” 
 

GAME 1
Dixie State went up 1–0 in the 

bottom of the first inning, scoring an 
unearned run off a Triton error.

UCSD came back in the fourth 
inning, as sophomore Mya Romero 
and freshmen Maria Sykes and 
Monique Portugal all singled to load 
the bases. Back at the top of the 
batting order with two outs, senior 

Kris Lesovsky singled to centerfield to 
score Romero and Sykes.

Dixie State tied the score with 
a homer from designated hitter 
Anna Cue in the fourth. The game 
remained tied until the sixth inning, 
as the Red Storm collected the 
winning run off another Triton error. 
 

GAME 2
Senior pitcher Camille Gaito kept 

seventh-seed Montana State Billings 
scoreless in the second leg of the West 
Regionals. The ace recorded seven 
strikeouts in her seven innings, while 

ON TO THE NEXT

One week after claiming the CCAA conference title, UCSD escaped the West 
Regional Semifinals with the sixth-seed. The Tritons will now head into the 
West Super Regional next weekend against CSU Dominguez Hills.

Tritons Top UCSB

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

MEN’S SOCCER — Nearing the 
end of their spring season, the 
UCSD Men’s Soccer team topped 
Division-I UC Santa Barbara last 
Friday, 4–0 in Oxnard, Calif. 

The 4–0 rout featured scoring 
from around the roster. Sophomore 
6-foot-5 forward Tsuk Haroush col-
lected the first goal midway into 
the first half. The second goal came 
from sophomore Ian MacAuley. 
Junior forward Evan Walker tallied 
the third goal, while sophomore 
defender Alec Arsht capped off the 

win with a penalty kick opportu-
nity.  The (10–0–8) Tritons failed 
to qualify for the CCAA conference 
tournament last season. However, 
the Tritons will return to the pitch 
next season with their entire roster 
intact, as the fully-manned UCSD 
squad outgunned a short-handed 
UCSB. “We came out very strong, 
and we proved to ourselves and 
everybody else that we can play 
with the best and beat the best,” 
sophomore goalkeeper Josh Cohen 
said. “If we can take the way we 
played yesterday and keep building 
on that for next Fall, we’ll definitely 
be going places.”
