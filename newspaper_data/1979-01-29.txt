'new University,' Sues Irvine SVP 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Aaoeillie M ....... "i&or 

The student newspaper at UC 
Irvine announced Friday that it 
is suing the student govern-
ment executive vice-president 
over her allqed trashing of 
3,000 copi of the newspaper 
two weeks ago because of a 
story the newspaper carried 
concerning a wet t-shirt contest 
at a bar near the Irvine 
campus. 

In a suit filed in Harbor 
Municipal Court Thursday, the 
paper claims that Karen 
Bjorneby destroyed new 
University property when she 
and several fellow students 
threw copies of the paper into 
trashcans around campus, thus 

forcing the paper's ad 
department to give refunds to 
advertisers. 

The controversy began when 
the new UniversUy ran four 
explicit photographs as part of 
a feature on a bar near campus 
that conducts wet t-shirt 
contests. 

Bjorneby, charging the paper 
with an attitude that "set the 
women's movement back 
twenty years," says she and 
about twenty-five friend 
dumped the copies of the paper 
and proposed a resolution in the 
ASUCI Council "strongly 
condemning" the new Uni-
versity and demanding that the 
paper run an apology for the 
story. 

That resolution passed the 
Council 11-6 Tuesday, but new 
University Editor Richard 
Clucas says the paper will not 
print an apology. 

"If we honestly thought that 
there was something wrong 
with the story, we WOUldn't 
have run it in the first place," 
Clucas says , adding that 
although the paper has 
received a few letters of protest 
over the story, "I don't think 
anyone on campus is really 
mad except Bjorneby and her 
friends. " 

Some Council members , 
including Vice-President in 
Charge of Student Services Bill 
Caraccio, agree. He and other 
Council members supported a 

resolution la t week that would 
have censured Bjorneby and 
require that she write a letter of 
apology for publication in the 
new University . 

After a Council debate in 
which Caraccio charged 
Bjorneby with "manipulating 
the Council" from her position 
as chair and engaging in 
parlimentary "prostitution," 
the Council voted 13-12 to send 
the resolution to a faculty-
student review committee, 
from where it could reach UCI 
Chancellor David Aldridge. 

Aldridge, though, was quoted 
in a local new spa per, the 
Orange Coast Daily Pilot, as 
saying the issue was nothing 
but a "college hijink," and 

compared the whol thing to 
" phone booth tuffing" or 
"goldfish swallowing. " Sally 
Peterson, UCI dean of students, 
was quoted by Ute Pilot as 
describing the incident as " no 
big issue." 

Caraccio ·says tomorrow 
night he will try to get the 
Council to formally reconsider 
its decision to shunt the 
resolution to the review 
committee. 

Bj orneby could not be 
reached for comment. 

Whether or not the new 
University ' s suit against 
Bjorneby is successful, one 
result of the controversy has 
been the ASUCI' decision to

Protestors Say 
City Should Keep 
Buses, Not Cops 

By John Klock 
Protestors at today 's San 

Diego City Council meeting will 
try to link San Diego's bus 
service cuts with a proposal to 
increase the city police force by 
100 men . 

The Com{Tlunity Coalition for 
Continued Bus Service , 
comprised of student, ethnic 
and community organizations, 
will argue that recent bus 
service cutbacks by the San 
Diego Transit Company are a 
direct response to a resolution 
on today's Council agenda 
which directs the city manager 
"to present to the City Council a 
report Indicating what other 
programs would have to be 
reduced or deleted" to handle 
an increase in police officers 
.supported by Mayor Pete 
Wilson and the Public Safety 

Committee. Tim O ' Neill , 
spokesman of the Progress for 
Labor Caucus of the Demo-
cratic Party said yesterday. 

Wilson upports IOcrease 
of 25 officers, with an additional 
fifty position to be transferred 
from ambulance units . The 
Committee on Public Safety 
wants 100 new officer , which 
would cost the city $2.5 million, 
or roughly the amount Ute 
Transit company was asked, to 
cut from its budget, O'Neill 
says. 

At UCSD, Nancy Laga, a 
Revelle AS Representative, 
will be circulating a petition at 
noon today protesting the 
resolution on the steps of the

McNair: Shuttle's 'Unlimited' 
By John Brock 

Calling the potential benefits 
of the U.S. Space Shuttle 
Program "unlimited," 
A tl'onaut Ronald McNair told 
a Mandeville au<iience 
Thursday night that "the mo t 
e·xciting achievements (in 

pace re earch) are yet to 
come." 

However, McNair, who spoke 
at the invitation of the Black 
Science Students' Organiza-
tion, cautioned that" the road to 
progress is not traight· 
forward; we have both long-
term scientific and short-term 
ocial con erns to deal with. 

But man' penchant to explore 
i as old a he is , and will not 
yield to uninformed doubt." 

Th Program is to begin in 
1980, McNair aid . The 
. 'unlimited" benefit or th 
Program range (rom 'cientific 

and industrial endeavors to the 
ability to obtain precise 
information on atmo pheric 
conditions, mineral deposit 
and agricultural conditions, he 
said. Space station and 
sophisticated earth-study 

at~lIites could both be 
launched into orbit by the 
shuttle, he added. 

McNair also discussed the 
use of the huttle itself as a 
science or manufacturing 
station. "In the front eetion of 
the shuttle is the cockpit. with a 
pilot, co-pilot, y tem 
controller and a cientist. 
Below that are the cr w'

But behind that i a whole big'

Disabled Gird for Federal 'Eund Fight 
By Mary Claire Blakemaa 

p~ News Servkfo 
America's disabled - the 

most recent minority to 
ol'lanize politically - could 
now become front-line 
casualties in President 
Carter's war on inflation. 

In spring, 1977, after a 28-day 
sil-in at a government building, 
activists in the new movement 
persuaded the President to sign 
a sweeping regulation that 
prohibits discrimination 
against them. But those 
regulations, as well as the 
entire movement, now face a 
barrage of opposition as the 
country fights to restore a 
faltering economy. 

"The biggest thing going on 
right now is the fight for 
money ," says wheel-chair 
bound Kitty Cone, who took 
part in the 1977 San Francisco 
sit-in, the longest ever at a 
federa l building. 

lYlary Claire Blakeman is a 
reporter whose work has 
appeared in regional news-
papers and magazines in 
Louisiana, California and 
North Carolina. She is 
currently on the editorial staff 
of PNS. 

" We're girding ourselves for 
the fight in Congress because 
we know there's going to be 
one," Cone said from her office 
at the Disability Law Resource 
Center in Berkeley. 

This particular fight centers 
on the question of how much 
Congress will appropriate for 
a mendments to the Rehabili-
tation Act of 1973 during the 
current session. 

The amendments, passed in 
the waning days of the last 
Congressional session a nd 
signed by the President shortly 
before the expiration deadline, 
include a variety of programs 
such as interpreters for the 
deaf, readers for the blind, and 
a national information 

.so I (WIST INVENT! CHOOSE 
WITH COINIC'TlOM FROM THt: 
P6P1l"i Of !! 

• 

clearinghouse for the disabled. 
One of .the most far-reachin,r 

national proposals, however. is 
the establishment of "in-

. dependent living" centers 
around the country, for which 
Congress has authorized $80 
million. 

I{ funded, the centers would 
represent a shift in govern-
ment 's perception of the 
disabled: independent living, 
with certain support services, 
could replace institutionali-
zation or welfare. 

Reality may impinge on that 
dream in the form of an austere 
federal budget proposed by 
President Carter. Plans to cut 
$15 billion from domestic 
spending focus on reducing 
funds for the Department of 
Health , Education and Welfare 
- which includes the Reha-
bilitation Services Adminis-
tration . As one woman who 
works with handicapped 
children in Washington, D.C. , 
put it, " Everything we hear 
about the budget is that it will 
be crummy. It 's going to be 
hard to work with." 

"We're arguing for a social 
services program, and social 
service programs are usually 
the sacrificial lambs," says 
Phil Draper , director of 
Berkeley 's Center for Inde-
pendent Living (CIL) . 

Draper has already had to 
deal with a loss of government 
funds when California ' s 
Proposition 13 cut $43,000 from 
CIL's budget. " Overall , it 
lessened our capacity to meet 
the needs of the disabled," he 
says. "And it comes at a time 
when we already had more 
demand for services than we 
could meet. The people who 
suffer are our clients." 

Lmda Gill of the Disability 
Law Resource Center (DLRC) 
sees the avai lability of 
necessary services as a 
co rnerstone to independent 
living. " Providing services like 
attendant care and trans porta-

tion are the basis for the center 
- it's the basis for the whole 
movement," she says . 
"Without ' services, you're 
going to have disabled people 
going back into institutions." 

To Judy Heumann, deputy . 

Letters' 

director of CIL, the proposed 
budget cuts on the federal and 
state levels go beyond the 
question of money. "Not only is 
funding being cut," she says, 
.. but also regulations, which we 
fought for very hard as human 

rights issues, are being 
attacked. This means a 
decrease in services as well as 
a maintenance of oppression 
against the disabled - the 
government can continue to 
control disabled people . .. 

There Are No 'Nice' Rapists 
Editor: 

I would like to comment on 
the story about F . Elaine 
Easley ' in the January 26 
Guardian . She believes the 
sentences for rape are too stifr 
in many cases. Her example: 
the rape of ~ girl named Maria 
by a man named Daniel 
Caudillo. Maria was pushed, 
shoved, cut twice, raped at 
knife point, sodomized and 
abused to the point of vomiting, 
diarrhea and hysteria. The 
rapist was not in any way a nice 
guy and had a record to prove 
it . He previously was convicted 
of kidnapping, forcible rape, 
sodomy, oral copulation, first-
degree robbery, first-degree 
burglery and inflicting great 
bodily injury with a knife. 

Easley argues that Caudillo 
did not inflict great bodiJ,y harm 
in the rape of Maria. She was 
cut and abused to such an 
extent that she vomited. Do we 
need to measure how deep the 
cuts were? The State courts 
ruled that he had committed 
" great bodily injury," but 

thanks to Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird, the California 
Supreme Court overturned the 
ruling and cut his sentence in 
half. So now he will get three 
years. To get a stiffer 
sentence: the prosecution will 

' henceforward not only have to 
prove that a rape occured, but 
also that it was pa rticularly 
violent. 

What right have I to speak 
against .Easley? On July 5, 1978, 
my sister and 1 and other 
members of my family were 

kidnapped ~ I was tied next to 
my sister. My sister was beaten 
with the blunt end of a hatchet 
and molested in my presence. 

At one point, we were tied up 
in the back of an RV. and the 
criminal was driving. A couple 
of us started to get loose, but he 
saw us and left the wheel and 
came toward us. The vehicle 
went orr the road and rolled 
down an embankment on 
Donner Pass. The criminal was 
not hurt, but my sister had 
multiple head injUries. 

Well . that was not the last of 

it. Wehadtoface himincourtin 
September, a n experience that 
was especially traumatic for 
my sister. He was charged with 
seventeen felony counts , 
among which were kidnapping, 
assault with a deadly weapon, 
armed robbery, grand theft 
auto, etc. We also found out he 
had been arrested thirty .times 
before on charges such as 
rObbery, sex offenses, etc., and 
had served seven years in 
Folsom Prison for first-degree 
murder. He wa s put on parole, 
but never saw his parole offi-
cer. That is when he met him. 

Wliat did we get out of· it? 
Broken bones, stitches and 
concussions. 

And what did he get out of it? 
No injuries ana a two year 
sentence with parole. 'The teal 
question is: will he turn to 
crime again ( havJ ng been in 
and out of ja II Ihi rty ti mes) or 
will he turn over a new leaf? 
And who will be his next 
victim? I pray that he won't 
come afte r me.

Crafts Center is Essential 
Editor: 

The cold institutional 
atm o sphere a nd lack of 
creative personal development 

I here at UCSD has been a 
complaint voiced quite often by 
students and faculty , but 
seldom a re progra ms de-
veloped and maintained to 
correct these shortcomings in 
the system. The Crafts Center 
provides an opportunity for all 
members of the University 
community to engage in 
relaxed , social and personally 
fulfilling activities while 
acquiring skills in the more 
"Ea rthy" crafts . A recent 
survey conducted by the Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs' 
office showed that the Crafts 
Center is indeed an important 
·and valued asset of the campus. 
but only ten percent of UCSD 
students are able to take 
advantage of it. The mostonen 
heard rea ons for not la~ing 
crafts classes are not enough 

time because of regular 
classes and the cost of the 
classes, ($25 for instruction, 
and extra for materials) , but 
many classes are filled and 
conducted wherever space can 
be found. Classes in ceramics 
are the most P9Pular, but 
stained glass, woodworking, 
jewelry, yoga. quiltma king, 
photogra pfJy, and other courses 
have many enrollees, who find 
th e ex pe rience rich and 
rewarding . 

Essential services such as 
Financial Aids, the Health 
Center, and other programs 
which by sheer physical and 
funding size dwarf the Crafts 
Center, will always 8CO~ 
higher in popularity . Because 
the center is severely limited 
by fundin., space , and 
personnel constraints, there is 
little likelihood that a large 
percentaie of students will 
ever b~ lakln,g crafts classes at 

the- same time, but it is there 
when someone needs to try 
something different from the 
regular curriculum. 

When compared to other 
Student Center funded 
programs, two out of three 
respondents to the Vice 
Chancellor's survey expressed 
the preference that Crafts 
Center Funding be Included as 
a Registration Fee benefit , yet 
two-thirds of the operating 
budget is from students paying 
extra for use of the facilities, 

~nd instruction. Any cutback of 
financial support would affect 
the quality of instruction, and 
kill the chances for new classes 
that students have expressed a 
desire to see offered. 

It is regrettablethal financial 
support of such a worthwhile, 
a nd " positive energy" 
program be viewed as a 
liability and pos Ibly be in 
jeopardy .

Khomeini Won't Meet 
In Paris with Bakhtiar 

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -
Troops firing machine guns a nd 
anti-government rioters a rmed 
with firebombs turned central 
Tehran into a bloody . flaming 
battlefront yesterday in the 
ci ty 's worst violence in months. 
At leas t 27 persons were 
reported killed and more than 
300 wounded. 

The street warfare exploded 
as Iran ' s political cr isi s 
reached a new and dangerous 
impasse. 

Ayatullah Ruholl ah Kho-
meini, spiritual leader of the 
anti-shah movement, rejected 
a proposal by Iran's Prime 
Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar 
for a meeting at Khomeini' s 
exile headquarters in France. 

The Moslem hol y m an 
demanded that the prime 

mmister resign to prove he is 
" on the s ide of the angels" and 
not of the shah. 

But officials French sources 
said Bakhtiar woutd travel to 
Paris this morning anyway, 
and this led to speculation tha t 
the prime minister , under 
increasing pressure from 
Khomeini's legions of mil itant 
supporters here , might be 
going to Paris to resign . 

A French weekly, Journal de 
Dimanche, reported yesterday 
there may be a deal a foot for 
Bhaktiar to step down and then 
be reappointed prime minister. 
This would circumvent a key 
Khomeini objection to 
Bakhtiar ' s government - that 
it is "illegal" because it was 
a ppointed by Shah Mohammad 
Reza Pahlavi .

Scientists Seek Location of 'Titanic 
By Eric HarpeU 

starr Writer 
The Titanic, last seen in 1912, 

when the "unsinkable" steam 
ship struck an iceber, and sank 
into the depths 01 the Atlantic 
Ocean, may soon be located. 
and photographed, providing 
that sufficient funds are 
obtained (or a Scripps Institute 
expedition to pbotoll"apb the 
sooken ocean Iller. 

The mission will attempt to 
determine what has become of 
the infamous Titanic, which 
struck an iceberg off the coast 
of Newfoundland and sank, 
taking with it the lives of 1,517 
unCortunate passengers. 

According toDr. FredSpeiss, 
Director of Scripps, a newly 
formed Canadian corporation 
called Seaonics has repeatedly 
contacted Scripps, asking their 
aid in locating and phot~ 
graphing the Tita!lic. Seaonics 

plans to capitalize on ' 
widespread public interest in 
the Titanic, by selling the rights 
to documentation of the Titanic 
expedition to the media , 
explained Speiss. 

Although oceanographers 
have not determined the exact 
poSition of the sunken vessel, it 
is known that the Titanic went 
down approximately two 
hundred miles southeast of 
Newfoundland, - To determine 
its location on the sea floor, 
oceanographers would use the 
technology gained in " fine 
scale" mapping, said Speiss. 

" We developed thecllpability 
of fine scale looks at the sea 
floor in doing su'rveys for the 
Navy," said Speiss, explaining 
the Navy's need to do follow up 
studies on the archaic and 
battered vessels which they 
had scaled and exploded 
beneath the surface of the 

ocean. Through their work with 
the Navy, Scripps researchers 
developed the techniques 
needed [or. previously im-
possible detection, and 
photographs o[ objects lying in 
deeper areas o[ the ocean. 

"There are three major 
elements involved in fine scale 
mapping," explained Speiss. 
First, is " Navigation by the sea 
[Ioor." A surface vessel 
equipped with sonar monitor-
ing equiptment would be 
connected by cable to the 
unmanned .. fish." The fish Is 
equipped with a sound emitting 
device, a side-looking sonar 
and cameras. 

Sound pulses from the lish 
would be emitted at regular 
intervals,' and rellected oft 
transponders planted at 
strategic locations on the sea 
floor. The position of the fish 
could then be calculated on 
board the research 'vessel by a 
computer-kept record of where 
the transponders are receiving 
sound impulses. 

The side looking sonar, a 
device which 'emits a narrow 
directional bea m of radio 
waves , would a lso be in 
operation on the fish , The radio 
waves are aimed at the sea 
floor, with the reflection of the 
waves to be monitored by 
telemetry on board the fi sh, and 
relayed to a computer on 
shipboard. A computerized 
transcriber would then 
assemble the data from the 
ra dio waves, making use of 

by 

pauses in the wave reflections 
caused by abnormalities on the 
sea floor, into a map of the area 
being covered, An object as 
farge as the Titanic would pose 
no problem for detection by this 
method. According to Speiss, 
, maUest we could -

locate would be just under a 
loot in length ." 

The lish would also carry 
photography equipment , 
providing a "look" at the 
sunken vessel. Speiss isn't sure 
exactly what the photographs

An Inside Account of the Child Star Era 

For more than a century the 
child star cult kept alive the 
consoling myth of child-
hood ~nocence in an 
increasingly complex and 
cyni~ca l world. In the Golden 
Age of Hollywood no stars 
were more universally 
adored - or more cruelly 
exploited - than- the child 
stars. But behind the sugary, 
idealized screen image, 
what was it like to actually 
be a child star, to become a 
self-made millionaire and 
the family breadwinner 
before reaching kinder-
garten age?

'But Weather is Real'Star 

By Henry J. DeVries 
Slaff Wrl&er 

Big Deal. So what j( Fuzzy 
Zoe Her wort the Andy Williams 
San Diego Open with a 6 under 
par for a total oC 282. So what if 
hordes oC celebrities gathered 
at Torrey Pines Cor the 
tournament. Everyone knows 
that the real star of the 
tournament was the San Diego 
climate. 

San Diego's weather is a 
superstar. It's a real money 
player. When the pressure is 
on, the local weather usually 
comes through in the clutch. 
But what" happened at the 
AWSDO? 

The weather Cor Wednes-
day's Pro-Am and Thursday's 
opening round was horrendous. 

The sky was overcast, rain 
threatened, and extremely cold 
winds whipped in from the 
ocean. But the San Diego 
climate must have bounced 
back when it heard that the 
weekend golf rounds would be 
televised on CBS. 

Turn the TV cameras on and 
San Diego produces blue skies 
and warm temperatures. All 
that is missing is the sound oC 
chirping birds and frolicking 
children. If the .we ekend 
weather wasn't perfect Cor the 
month oC January, it sure came 
awful close, That is, until 
Sunday, 

The players and the galleries 
at the Pro-Am nearly died of 
exposure, The Cans shivered as 
they watched some oC the best

agers Feel Abs~nc~ of Star Player 
By Joy Re ..... 

Tbe absence of star player 
Carol Hawley was the women's 
basketball team's downfall in 
two bome games last week as 
they were barely edged out 
Thursday. !>8-52 by Pt. Lorna. 

and badly trounced by UC 
Irvine Friday, 57-33. 

Hawley, who has been 
averaging 20 points per game 
this season, was out sick for 
both of last week's contests. She 
was sorely missed by her 

8-ball Team Defeated 
In Close Match, 64-55 

By Kevin Elliott 
[n a repeat performance of 

last week's game against 
USIU, the UCSD Varsity 
basketball team again 
collapsed in the closing minutes 
of action and losta close contest 
Friday night to highly regarded 
Point Lorna 64-55. 

Only a handful of spectators 
showed up at the Main Gym, 
but those that did witnessed 
UCSD and Point Lorna putting 
on an excitiig defensive battle. 
Neither t'l!lm was able to 
penetrate ' each other's tough 
defense and as a result, neither . 
could grab a big lead until Point 
Lorna pulled away in the last 
si~inutes of play to win by 

CIEE TIlA VEL 

nine. 
The first half resembled the 

first halves of the Triton's last 
two games. UCSD broke out on 
top, but Point Lorna fought 
back and the lead see-sawed 
back and forth. With three 
minutes left in the half the 
Tritons surged into a five point 
lead, 26-21. Point Loma refused 
to quit and evened the score, 28-
28, at halftime. 

The Tritons came out running 
in the second half and 
attempted to wear down their 
opponents. Led by Scott 
Knudsen and Gary Kloppen-
burg, UCSD moved into a six 
point lead , 42-36, with 12

teammates as they averaged a 
weak 33% from the noor on 
Friday. 

Nonetheless, Coach Judy 
Malone feels that there were 
benefits from Hawley's 
absence. After Thursday's 
defeat by Pt. Lorna , she 
commented, " We learned some 
valuable lessons, mainly that 
we can play without Carol. The 
other girls gained a lot of 
experience playing together -
shooting more and holding a 
pretty good defense." 

Gaining valuable individual 
experience against Pt. Lorna 
was Lisa Yonumoto, who 
started as point guard in 
Hawley's place. 

Mary Egan had an excellent 
scoring game with 18 points. 
Lori Goldfarb and Jill Keene 
contributed 10 and 11 points 
respectively. Stacy Macfadyen 
followed with 7, Laurie Scott 
had 4 and Yonumoto put in 2. 

The Ttitons looked tired and 
seemed to feel Hawley's 
absence more Friday against 
UC Irvine, scoring only nine 
times from the floor during the 
entire game. 

"Irvine isn't that strong," 
commented Coach Malone. 
"Most of their scoring was due 

one person. They also fouled 
quite a bit," she added. "Seven 
of their players had three or 
more fouls." 

Keene led with 15 points, 
Macfadyen scored 10. Goldfarb 
added 5 and Egan followed with 
3.

'Target' 
Is Off 
For Actors 

By Beth Accomando 
Staff Writer 

[n recent years viewers have 
been subjected to films that 
speculate a bout the real story 
behind historic events. Some of 
these films a re stylish -and 
intelligently executed, such as 
The Day of the Jackel , a 
fictionalize d account of an 
assassinatio n attempt on 
President DeGaulle; but other 
films of this genre fail 
miserably, such as Brass 
Target. 

Brass Target deals with a 
stolen train load of gold and the 
theory that General Patton was 
assassinated when he tried to 
find the criminals . The premise 
for the film is intriguing, but the 
film stumbles over its own 
ridiculou complexities and 
two-dimensiona l characters. 
The characters are so thinly 
dra wn th a t when John 
Cassavetes gi ves the obligatory 
explanation speech no one 
remembers who he is talking 
about. 

Brass Target abuses the fine 
ta lents that the cast offers. 
George Kennedy's gross 
parody of Patton is an. 
embarrassment which does not 
even merit comparison with 
George C. Scott's thunderous 
performance of the title role in 
Patton. Max Von Sydow as an 
internationa l hit man gives a 
pale imitation of his chilling 
role in 3 Days of the Condor. 

Overall Brass Target fails to 
achieve any kind of intelligence 
or excellence a nd it deserves to 
be passes up. 

The peerless Hines, called 
"the progenitor of a ll modern 
Hlzz playing" by the London 
Times , will serve as a regents ' 
lecturer at the university Jan. 
28 through Feb. 3. Hines will 
present' three symposia, free 
and open to the public, as well 
as his concert performances. 

The first symposium is 
scheduled from noon to 2 p.m . 
Tuesday, Jan. 30, in room B210 
of the Mandeville Center. An 
informal discussion is 
cheduled frol)'l 2-3: 45 p.m. 

.. 

Thursday, Feb. I , in room B152 
of the Mandeville Center and 
the final di cussion will be 
conducted from II a.m. to noon 
Friday , Feb. 2, in room B210. 

" Jazz, as someone once said, 
means Hines. Do not miss him. 
It is magic, solid gold magic, 
whose like you will seldom 
know again," said Derek 
Jewell of the London Times in a 
review earlier this year. 

At 73, the Fatha dazzles his 
audiences with 

Jazz great Earl "Fatha" Hines will perform here tonight.

decades of profe sional 
experience, an d promises

Hines, born in Duquesne, 
Pa., rose to fame in the '208 and 
'lOs as a bandleader, singer and 
pianist. His turf was the Grand 
Terrace Night Club in Chicago, 
part-owned by AI Capone, a nd 
broadcasts from the Grand 
Terrace brought the Hines 
band popularity in the Midwest 
and Canada. The 

were carried from New York to 
california, and Hines says his 
was the first black band on the 
network. 

Hines has been ranked with 
Coleman Hawkins and Louis 
Armstrong as one of jazz 
music's premier innovators. 
He made the first in a series of 
recordings with A rmstrong and 
clarinetist Jimmie Noone in 
1928. Today the recordings are 
regarded as jazz classics . 

Among the Fatha's proteges

Golf trournament 
(Continued r ..... page 5) 
round sco:-es wouldn't have 
counted ei he ... Winds gusting 
up to 35-40 mptf blew in from the 
ocean and turned Torrey Pines 
into a night:mare. In the safety 
of the locker room the pros 
called the AWSDO every four, 
five, and six letter word they 
could think of. 

Friday was like another 
world. San Diego weather was 
back to normal for two days and 
the golf scores reflected h. 
Many of the top pros attended 
the tournament , and the 
leaders going into Sunday's 
final round read like a Who's 
Who of golf. 

Such top 1978 money winners 
as Tom Watson ($362,429), Dr. 
Gil Morgan ($267,459), Andy 
Bean ($267,241), Lee Trevino 
($228,723), and Fuzzy Zoeller 
($109,055) were among the 

tournaments leaders. 
One pro who wasn't at the 

tournament was superstar 
Jack Nicklaus. At this point in 
his career Nicklaus only 
competes in about 10 tourna· 
ments a year. In 1978 Nicklaus 
finished in the money in 13 of 
the 15 tourney he entered (or a 
total of $256,672. Not bad for a 
part-time job. 

None of the pros ;n 
attendance are hu rt that 
Nicklaus isn' t competing for 
the $45,000 top purse in thi 
$250,000 event. San Diego golf 
fans who wish to see Nicklaus 
compete in person may get 
their chance in April at La 
Costa's Tournament of 
Champions. Fans of ideal San 
Diego weather also may have to 
wait until April to see their 
favorite super~tar .

wholly intact. " 

"There are t~o payoffs for an 

expedition to the Titanic," said 
Speiss. " The Titanic's effect on

Volunteer Program Available 
By Vidya Tolani 

The Warren College Volun-
teer Program, which began last 
quarter, is open to all UCSD 
students to help them find 
volunteer work in fields that 
may interest them. 

Geri Nolsi. Warren Provost 
Administrative Assistant is in 
charge of the program and has 
already referred' 15 students 
into different agencies. Some of 
the work th!ft the students are 
doing include peer counseling, 
tutoring at elementary and 
high sdiools and working at the 
Y.M,C.A. and the animal 
control center. 

" The way it works," 
explained Nolsi, "is that there 
is a bulletin board outside the 
office listing the current 

placements. The student looks 
through this and our files and it 
is up to him to contact the 
agency and work out a 
placement. " 

Nolsi added that if a student 
cannot find anything suitable 
from the listings available and 
has ideas about what he wants 
to do, the program will try to 
help him to find some work. 

"La~t quarter, we helped one 
woman do work with the 
government," she said. 

Nolsi said that the program 
provides the student with 
experience and contacts in the 
fields that he desires work in. 
" This type of volunteer work 
would be good for a resume," 
she said. She added that no all 
students who have participated 

in the program do so for the 
sake of their careers or to gain 
working experience. "Some 
students just have a few spare 
hours that they want to fill by 
helping others out," she said. 

The main listings that the 
program offers are doing 
volunteer work with animals; 
drug , peer , and group 
counseling; assisting con-
sumer education; working with 
the handicapped, recreational 
therapy at various hospitals 
and clinics and other health-
related jobs; visiting senior 
citizens, and tutoring. 

More information on the 
program and the current 
placements ava ilable are 
ava ilable at the Warren 
Provost Office.

minutes left and seemingly had 
Point Lorna confused, 

Howard Grunloh scored a 
three point play to give UCSD 
their biggest lead at 47-40 with 
just nine minutes to play . Point 
Lorna regrouped however, and 
with only ix minutes left , Tony 
Ty on scor d to give Point 
Lorna their first lead in the 
second half. 50-49. 

At this point, the Tritons 
began to fall apart. turning the 
ball over and committing 
offensive fouls . As they fell 
further down, UCSD was forced 
to fQ!!l. setting Pt. Lorna up on 

,the freethrow line, 
The final stats reflect the 

Triton's demise in the second 
half. Thirty fouls for UCSD 
compared to Point Lorna's i9 
resulted in the sinking of 24 free 
throws, including 16 of 21 in the 
second half. As a team, UCSD 
again shot poorly in the second 
half hitting only 36%, 

Le ding the scoring for 
UCSD was Brockett scoring a 
game high 12 points a nd 
grabbing 12 rebounds , Barry 
Elliott led Point Loma with 11 
points,

moking Still Hazardous to Health 
The ::wl:~e-:a:rgeon New Surgeon General's Report Confirms according to Shimkin. 
~:':::-:i·:.."r::.~~a:~!i!~~ Prev10us Findings of Researchers 
little about the dangerous 
effects of tobacco that was not 
known before. However. 
according to Michael B. 
Shimkin. M.D.. professor of 
Community Medicine at UCSD 
and noted oncologist. although 
the report is a rehash of 
previously collected data and 
research. the real importance 
is that it contains "not one iota" 
contradicting previously 
published documents. 

behavioral characteristics of 
these children. 

commented "I wiSh I knew." 
He contemplated the pos-
sibilities. 

Of primary importance is the 
welfare of the tobacco industry. 
He quoted Isafah 1: 18 ("Come 
let us reason together .. .. ") as a 
reference (or dealing with the 
tobacco producers. An equally 
lucrative alternative should be 
found to replace tobacco. 

Another possibility is special 
tobacco shops where adults 
could buy cigarette. This 
solution would prevent minors 
from using community vending 
machines and grocery store 
check-out lines as places to 
obtain cigarettes. The object is 
not so much to regulate 
tobacco, but to make it less 
available to future smokers. 

Shimkin holds the opinion 
that an outright ban on 
cigarettes would have just as 
much of an effect as prohibition 
did in the 1920s and 1930s. 

Shimkin. who reviewed the 
21h inch thick , 1,200 page 
manuscript for the Department 
of Health , Education and 
Welfare stressed that the 
cause of cancer are indeed 
multifa ctorial. In layman 's 
language. this means that 
causes can stem from a 
person's heredity . immune 
responses and environment. 
Any or all of these can 
determine whether an in-
dividual develops cancer. 
However, in comparable walks 
of life. the morbidity and 
mortality rates of smokers are 
much higher than those of non-

Among the findings of recent 
studies published in the current 
report are : the overall 
incidence of lung cancer in 
current cigarette smokers is 
higher than in non-smokers; 
rates of death and disease are 
higher for smokers who inhale; 
in general. mortality rates are 
higher for smokers who inhale; 
and as the years of non-
smoking progress . the 
mortality rate among former 
smokers decreases. 

Also, the studie proved that 
pipe and cigar smokers show a 
higher rate of death than people 
who do not smoke, but a lower 
rate than that of cigarette 
smokers; there is a direct link 
between smoking and cancer of 
the lung. larynx . mouth , 
esophagus, bladder. kidney and 
pancreas; and there is a 
greater incidence of heart 
disease and hardening of the 
arteries (arteriosclerosis) 
among smokers. 

According to Joseph 
Califano. secretary of Health. 
Education and Welfare. 
"Smoking is the largest 
preventa ble cause of death in 
America." Still, one in three 
adults in America smokes and 
smoking among women and 
teenaged girls is a trend on the 
rise. Shimkin stated that the 
reasons for this involve many 
factors also, ranging from peer 
pressure and the desire to 
appear . 'sophisticated, " to 
poor parental role models.

the day care campaign, but you 

don't know what to do? 

smokers. 
This is not a new observation. 

In 1900 there was a noticeable 
increase in lung cancer. By 
1928, it was found that heavy 
smoking was more common 
among cancer patients than 
control groups and. by 1938. it 
was shown that smokers had a 
much shorter life expectancy 
than non-smokers. Finally . in 
1957. the Surgeon General went 
on record stating that there 
were indications of a causative 

Among the more recent facts 
found was that smoking during 
pregnancy lowers the birth-
weight of the child and may 
affect the physical growth, 
mental development and 

The prevention of smoking 
rests heavily on the effective-
ness of anti-smoking education. 
Shimkin stated that although 
the anti-smoking campaign has 
had some effect (the rate of 
smoking has dropped to 1950s 
levels) it has not been as 
effective as it should Pe. This is 
because of the strength of the 
Tobacco Lobby in Congress as 
well as the 500 miWon dollar 
advertising budget of the 
tobacco industry. 

When asked what the future 
direction of the no-smoking 
campaign would be, Shimkin
