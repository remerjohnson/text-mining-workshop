Suspicious 
Object Draws 
UCSD Police 
Cardboard device was 
reportedly placed by visual 
arts students 
IIyEDWU 
Staff Writer 

A suspicious package placed on one of the 
concrete pillars located between the High Bay 
Physics Laboratory and the Science Engineering 
Research Facility forced UCSD police to close 
Matthews Lane on Wednesday afternoon until 
units of the San Diego Fire Depanment con-
firmed that the package was harmless. 

No buildings were evacuated. 
According to police, the package consisted of 

"a piece of cardboard attached to a silver disk and 
a sponge, held together with red tape." 

Police also described the object as resembling 
a "transistor device" from a distance, an appear-
ance that ultimately spurred a citizen to notify 
campus officials at around 12:55 p.m. 

An employee at the UCSD police said there 
were reports that the placement of the package 
was a project by students in a visual arts class. 
The reports are still unsubstantiated. 

Police subsequently closed Matthews Lane 
for about 20 minutes, preventing East and 
Regents Parking shuttle drivers from dropping 
passengers off near the Price Center, as they nor-
mallywould. 

"With Matthews Lane closed to vehicular 
traffic, we began to have the shuttles stop at park-
ing lot P4{)3, near the Canyonview pool, instead." 
said Frank Buono, shuttle operations coordinator 
for lransportation Services. 

In addition, the office sent a representative on 
foot to the Price Center shuttle stop to alen pas-
sengers of the change. Normal shuttle service 
resumed soon after Matthews Lane was 
reopened by campus police., 

Hate Incident Under Investigation 
MEChA display in Price Center allegedly defaced and removed 
By PARISA BAMARIAN 
Senior Staff V;riter 

The MEChA organization'S awareness 
display on the Price Center's grass area was 
allegedly defaced las't Thursday. 

The display included a poster that docu-
mented how many immigrants died trying to 
cross the border and also included 250 cross-
es memorializing the dead. 

Warren freshman Eleazar Loza, a member 
of the MEChA organization, said that he saw 
the vandalism on their poster. 

According to Loza, the words, "This hap-

pens because they are criminals," were written 
in black ink, and were about three inches tall. 

Loza said that he is very unhappy that 
someone would write such a comment on the 
poster. 

"[t is extremely offensive to the Latino 
community: Loza said. 

Loza said that MECM did not take the 
display down for Admit Day, even after the 
poster was defaced. 

"We decided to leave the display with the 
graffiti up for Admit Day," Loza said. "But

Physicians Begin Alzheimer's Project 

Physicians at the UCSD School of Medicine 
implanted genetically modified brain tissue into 
the brain of an Alzheimer's patien\ 0'; April 5. 

The study that will ensue marks t~ first In a 
series of studies physicians at the un~erslty will 
be dOing with the disease. 

The procedure took 11 hours and was done 
on a 6().year-old Caucasian women who had 
entered the beginning stages of the disease, 
which can include memory loss. 

The surgery is led by UCSD neurosurgeon Hoi 
Sang U. The study was led by UCSD neurologist 
Mark H. Tuszynski and is unique because it is 
the first of its kind to use human gene therapy to 
treat a disease of the nervous system. 

The treatment attempts to deliver a nerve 
growth factor to dying brain cells. Improvement 
may be seen in the patient within a few months, 
but the long-term efficacy of the treatment may 
not be gauged for several years because of the 
need to test 'it in a variety of subjects. 

The study will be conducted in several phas-
es, the first being intended to test whether the 
procedure is safe. This study Is known as the . 
·safety/toxitity · study and Is based on previous 
work done by Tuszynski. 

ScrlPp. Student Receive. 
Fellowship, Writing Award 

Luc Rainville, a graduate student at the 
Scri pps Institution of Oceanography, has recent-
ly been honored with two prestigious awards. 

He has been given a $20,000 fellowship from 
the Link Foundation Ocean Engineering and 
Instrumentation Fellowship Program and an 
Outstanding Student Paper Award from the 
American Geophysical Union. 

Rainville is currently working under the guid-
ance of Scripps oceanography professor Rob 
Pinkel. His research focuses on internal waves 
and instrumentation. 

With the fellowship, Rainville 1S creating a 
·wirewalker: an instrument that will have the 
ability to profile the ocean. The device uses the 
surface waves to examine the water column. 
The design of the instrument Is innovative 
because of its simplicity and low cost. 

The Outstanding Paper Award was given to 
Rainville for a paper he wrote based on his 
research on internal waves in the East China

Porter noted the high level of state support 
that UCSD receives, UCSD Connect, and collab-
orations between the university and corporate 
partners as specific reasons for economic 
growth In the area. 

Porter alSo noted numerous challenges the 
region faces, including a disparity between the 
living wage and the cost of living.

Hate: 
Hate crimes have rrwre serious 
legal repercussions 
ContInued from .... 1 
then the poster display and crosses went 
missing: Loza said. 

According to UCSD police detective 
Nate Floyd, the case is being investigated as 
a hate incident. 

"If the identity of the perpetrator 
becomes known, the offender could face 
disciplinary action under the Student Code 
of Conduct," Floyd said. 

Floyd said that the difference between 
what is considered a hate crime and a hate 
incident is that a hate incident is not con-
sidered a criminal offense under the law, 
however if the perpetrator is identified, legal 
consequences may arise. 

According to the Student Office for 
Human Relations, a hate crime is an act of 
hostility or violence committed against a 
person or group or property because of 
their race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, 
sexual orientation, religion or political 
beliefs. Hate incidents are things such as 
nonthreatening name-calling, racist leaflets 
and hate mail. 

Floyd said that the scrawled words were 
noticed Thursday and then the cardboard 
placard and crosses were noticed missing on 
or befor~ Admit Day, which began Saturday. 

"We are looking into whether the same 
erson who defaced the poster came back 

and took the crosses and poster display, or 
whether it is a cOJTlpletely unrelated inci-
dent," Floyd said . 

There are conflicting reports by several 
witnesses - some of whom claim to have 

se~n one, others, two - white males taking 
the crosses early Saturday. 

It is still unknown whether a university 
employee removed the display for Admit Day. 

julia Adame, the director of Student 
Office of Human Relations, a hate and bias 
prevention and education program, said the 
language that was written on the poster 
would be considered as a hate crime 
because it presented a clear messag·e. 

"The defacement is a message that you 
are not welcome on our campus, that you 
are criminals and we don't want you here," 
Adame said. 

But Adame said ;hat immigrants are nec-
essary on our campus and to our state. 

"We do need immigrants because no one

The second violation was brought to the

accused of "dorm storming; which is dis-
tributing material and campaigning in the 
residence halls and on-campus apartments.

else will do the work: she said. "Who is 
going to work in 110 degree temperature in 
the Central Valley? No one except the 
immigrants who are so desperate for any 
kind of work in order to support themselves 
and their families." 

Anthony Valladolid, director of student 
legal services, said the defacement of the 
poster cannot be viewed as anything but as 
a message of hate. 

"It is a provocative and malicious mes-
sage; Valladolid said. "It is hateful. [t is 
criminalizing a whole class of people." 

Valladolid said he does not believe that 
what tRe vandal alluded to by the graffiti has 
any basis. 

"Because they came illegally into our 
country out of extreme need, that should 
result in a justifiable death sentence?" 
Valladolid said. "[t is unconscionable to 
think that." 

Marshall junior Delia Pacheco, the high 
school conference chair of MEChA, said 
that the defacement of the poster is a symp-
tom of a lack of diversity at UCSD. 

"I think it is a reflection of this university 
in terms of the energy that is not put toward 
diversifying our school: Pacheco said. 

Pacheco said that she is hurt and very 
upset at having the poster not only defaced, 
but also taken down. 

"[ am very angry because we put our 
money, time and effort into making this pro-
ject to educate the campus," Pacheco said. 

Muir junior jessica Lopez, chair of 
MEChA, said that this act is only one exam-
ple of continued racism and hate that exist 
in society. 

"Though it's very painful to know how 
we are viewed, at the same time it's easier to 
see that racism does exist because it's an iso-
lated racial incident; Lopez said. "But we 
can't just focus on these, because it happens 
every day. This hate crime will serve as a 
reminder that racism still goes on: 

Pacheco said that the MEChA organiza-
tion would not let the hate stop them from 
trying to bring awareness to the campus of 
the current situation of immigrants. 

"We will redo the entire project: Pacheco 
said. "We will have an entire month of 
Awareness rather than the two weeks we had 
planned: 

Anyone with any information regarding 
the graffiti or any hate crime is encouraged 
to contact UCSD police detective Nate 
Floyd at (858) 534-4359, or julia Adame at 
the Student Office for Human Relations at 
(858) 534-5661 . 

Members of the Nexus slate said they 
placed printed materials on doorsteps of the 
Marshall Upper apartments and that they 
visited the suites of people they knew in the 
residence halls. 

"We didn't actually go in and talk to any-
one we didn't know," Scarpelli said. "If we 
had known dorm storming was blatantly 
illegal, we wouldn't have done it." 

Sherry also said that the slate members 
didn't know that what they were doing was 
wrong.

A.S. Funds Better 
Spent Elsewhere 

It is humorous to observe that A.S. 
Council feels it is necessary to give away 
school-related items designed to get stu-
dents to come out and meet their elected 
officers. Only at UCSD would it take free 
blue books and schedules of classes to get 
people to care - which they still really 
don't. 

Though we understand the A.S. Coun-
cil's motives, the Guardian feels there are 
better uses for the money spent on these 
programs. 

Blue books cost about a quarter apiece, 
which is not a lot of money out of one's 
wallet. When that number is multiplied by a 
few thousand, the figures begin to add up. 
In aggregate, the giveaways cost UCSD stu-
dents $5,000 each year. 

Receiving anything for free is nice, but it 
is not worth wasting A.S. money. 

This giveaway is also a waste of money 
because the AS. Council should be trying 
to wean people away from the schedules of 
classes, not encouraging their sales. The 
schedule of classes is available online so 
that students will not have to spend money 
or waste paper by buying a book. 

This promotion only encourages the use 
of printed matter and demonstrates to the 
student body that the use of this item is 
encouraged. The Guardian feels there are 
better things to give away that would pro-
mote more unity among students and the 
school's elected leaders. 

Barbecues like the ones that currently 
exist are a great expenditure of this allocat-
ed money. They promote a way to foster 
better communication between the stu-
dents and the school's leaders. The A.S. 
Council should focus more on events such 
as these. 

Unlike mindlessly passing out papers, 
barbecues are a lot of fun for all parties 
involved. Students getting handed little 
books in passing on Library Walk does not 
tell them anything about their A.S. repre-
sentation. Students eating free food given to 
them by members of the AS. Council are 
about as open as possible to socialize with 
their representatives. 

There are other beneficial ways to spend 
this money. For example, even an additional 
$3,000 could increase what is offered at fes-
tivals like Sun God and Fallfest. More 
specifically, more daytime activities could be 
planned for these events as they give each 
student equal opportunity to have fun. With 
the current giveaways, only a select few 
actually benefit. 

In addition, this money could also fund 
more "Nooners" and uTGIFs" during the 
week. The attendance at this year's events 
shows that students like attending the 
shows. By increasing the number of these 
events on campus, more students would be 
able to see free entertainment. 

This would also be the best way to get 
many students to see and meet the AS. 
Council. By having councilmembers say a 
few words before each show, students 
would be given the chance to actually see 
who they are and what they do in office. 
Once again, everyone benefits.

China's Government Vilifies 
America in International Crisis 

In light of the unfair detainment of 24 American members of a spy plane, 
President Bush has done his best to defuse tensions between the nations 

Iy RYAN DARBY 
St8ff Writer 

I can't help bein:g anything but 
appalled by the outrageous spectacle 
China has orchestrated over the past 
two weeks. It is absolutely despicable. 
After one of its fighters slammed into 
an American surveillance plane, the 
country had the audacity to hold all 24 
crew members hostage and dismantle 
U.S. military property, refusing to allow 
anyone to return home unless the 
United States offered some kind of an 
apology and claim responsibility for the 
incident. 

I'm sorry, but that is just plain sick-
ening. First of all, China's pilot was bla-
tantly at fault in this collision, which 
occurred 80 miles off the coast of 
China, well within international air-
space. 

Second, the U.S.'s surveillance 
plane, an EP-3, is the size of a Boeing-
737, much slower and less maneuver-
able than the smaller F-8 fighters the 
Chinese pilot was flying. They're trying 
to tell us that this bulky, awkward barge 
with wings veered into their fast , agile 
fighter? Not in a million years, especial-
ly now that the Pentagon has disclosed 
that the plane was set on auto pilot. 

Furthermore, Chinese pilots have 
been recorded engaging in such reck-
less behavior during reconnaissance 
flights since the Clinton administra-
tion . There have even been reports of 
crew members seeing the other pilots' 
faces as their fighters have closed to 
within 30 feet of the spy planes. The 
arrested American soldiers reportedly 
told Brigadier General Neal Sealock 
that the flanking fighter had been flying 
recklessly and erratically before the col-
lision. 

Anyone who knows anything about 
aircraft knows who caused this colli-
sion. One hint: It wasn't the spy plane. 
But you may be wondering why the 
United States won't offer a full apology 
even if it wasn 't our fault , timply to pre-
vent this from becoming an interna-
tional incident. Unfortunately, this 
-~L~eri~-.,jl ~~)p~p}~ti~.aLi!lfipen.t. , 

China milked it for all it's worth. 
The missing Chinese pilot'S parents 

have been interviewed on Chinese tele-
vision, vilifying the big, bad Americans. 
The missing pilot'S wife publicly called 
President Bush a coward. Fellow com-
munists in Vietnam are stepping up to 
the plate for the Chinese. Their presi-
dent Jiang Zemin has gone worldwide 
with his very selective version of the 
truth, and with several lies to boot. 

The Chinese have refused American 
military assistance in searching for the 
missing pilot; we big, bad Americans 
have done enough harm already. The 
surviving pilot, decked out in full uni-
form, tried not to look reporters in the 
eye as h.e claimed the hulking American 
plane veered sharply into his helpless, 

In case you're having trouble 
reading between the lines, this 
isn't about a collision. This is 
about politics; this is Beijing

unsympathetic White House 
administration.

ing between the lines, this isn't about a.

Beijing trying to bully its way to a diplo-
matic victory over a new, unsympathet-

We all know about Slick Willy's 

involvement with the communist Chi-
nese government; they allegedly funded 
his president ia l campaign, and his 
administration allegedly sold them our 
most classified nuclear weapons tech-
nology and taught them how to use it. 
Bush, on the other hand, has changed 
our relationship with China from 
strategic ally to competitor. It should

wants to secure a diplomatic victory as 
soon as possible. 

China made it clear that there would 
be no compromise through its hard-
line, ·our way or the highway· negotia-
tions, maintaining until recently, that if 
we didn't offer a full apology our sol-
diers and aircraft were not. coming 
home. The White House has been 
painfully diplomatic here, offering 
everything short of an apology. 

Bush has handled himself reason-
ably well thus far in his first foreign 
conflict. He came to the table to com-
promise; they sought to conquer. After 
two weeks of speaking to a crimson 
wall, it is inevitable that our president 
will take a harder stance in kind . He has 
several options, after all. He can autho-
rize the selling of arms to Taiwan, 
which China considers a renegade 
providence. 

The U.S. Navy just released a list of 
possible ways for us to improve Tai-
wan's military. After all, the purpose of 
the ongoing reconnaissance flights is to 
ensure that China is not preparing to 
invade Taiwan. 

Also, the United States has a very 
large say in China's foreign trade. Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell has warned 
that this incident may impact American 
support for China's entry into the 
World Trade Organization, which could 
be ruinous. Looking back at the Soviet 
Union, we all know that communist 
natiorls face uphill economic-battles, so 
they (need every ounce of leverage they 
can obtain: 

,~n light of all this anti-American 
propaganda being spread worldwide, we 
have to stand up for what's right. The 
biggest problem with the Clinton 
administration was its encouragement 
of apathy over fortitude. 

As long as the economy went well, 
the majority could remain blissfully 
unaware that America was no longer 
the pillar of strength protecting the free 
world, but rather NATO 's puppet, 
which somehow cast a blind thi rd eye 
upon the drastic military buildup in

Masked Group Fights Against Injustice 
No 

Angel 
ANGELA CARRIER 

O ur first encounter was four years ago. It was not very personal or intimate, 
but while watching him on the TV 
screen, this masked man left me 
feeling wonder and intrigue. How 
could one forget such a man? His 
leadership, his words, his cause, 
his voice and his eyes were etched 
in my memory years before I 
would realize how important he 
really is. Placed on posters and T-
shirts with the faces of leaders 
such as Emiliano Zapata and 
Ernesto Guevara, Subcomandante 
Marcos stands out as a living 
leader for the indigenous people 
of Mexico. 

An alluring feature of Marcos 
lies in his mystery. The whole 
Zorro mystique surrounding tl1e 
masked man fighting for the peo-
ple is intriguing. Marcos uses his 
words rather than a sword to fight, 
though the mark of the Z now 
represents the cause and presence 
of the Zapatistas. And in this case, 
the mask is not worn by just one, 
but by all. 

Though the brilliance and 
strategy of Marcos as an individ-
ual cannot be denied, one man 
alone is not enough to change 
years of oppression and under-
representation. It takes the collab-
orative effort of a group willing to 
fight and persevere through time 
for its cause. Though Marcos is 
viewed as the front man for the 
Zapatistas, he does not stand 

alone. 
The black mask that Marcos 

wears; like all Zapatistas, is sym-
bolic of unity. The masking allows 
for individuals to put aside physi-
cal features and to come together 
on one level , as one face. 

The journey of the Zapatistas 
is not one followed only by indige-
nous peoples or Mexicans; it pos-
sesses an array of international 
support. The Zapatistas appeal to 
groups ranging from gay and les-
bian activists to feminists. These 
groups recognize that the fight of 
the Zapatistas is a fight for all peo-
ples who suffer injustices, discrim-

ination, intolerance and exclu-
sion. The all-encompassing 
nature of the Zapatistas is amaz-
ing and inspiring. There are not 
many groups that can draw suc.h 
an mixed crowd of people, a mIX 
that may have its differences but 
shares a common cause to 
protest: 

Sadly, many readers will be 
seeing the names of Subcoman-
dante Marcos and the Zapatistas 
for the first time in this article. 
Many Americans are ignorant of 

the happenings in Mexico, despite 
the recent nature and proximity of 
the events. Although the Zapatis-
tas have been one of the first 
groups to use the Internet as a 
communicative tool. yet many 
people are still unaware of their 
struggle. 

The recently completed "Zap-
atour." the trek of the Zapatistas 
from their base in Chiapas to the 
capital of Mexico City, went large-
ly unnoticed by U.S. media. It was 
front page news when the group 
first embarked on the journey, but 
it soon disappeared from the news 
completely. 

Was it not entenaining enough 
for the American public to read 
about one of the largest grassroots 
movements in years? This was an 
event that drew international 
attention, and it was still not 
enough to bring proper exposure 
and explanation of the situation to 
the American public. It is even 
more frustrating to think that 
soon it will be completely out of 
the "newsworthy" category unless 
it involves death or U.S. interven-
tion. 

The United States seems to 
ignore the problems in Mexico 
because they might hit a little too 
close to home. Oppression and 
mistreatment of indigenous peo-
ples? Certainly that would never 

. happen here in the United States. 
The plight of the Native Americas 
in this land is all too similar to that 
of the indigenous peoples of Mex-
ico. 

The public's mild obsession 
with Marcos is more than justi-
fied, as he is a man fighting for a 
cause and selflessly supporting the 
people who deserve to be given 
the rights long overdue to them.

High Cost of Books 
Hits Wallets Hard 
Ridiculous textbook prices force 
students to turn to other resources 
By PARNAZ TAHERI 
Staff Writer 

As I casually strolled through the 
bookstore looking for the endless 
number of textbooks required for 
my four very demanding classes this 
quarter, I nearly had a heart attack. 

The prices I came upon for 
nearly every book were a crock. I 
don't know about everyone else, 
but I am a starving college student 
who si mply cannot afford to pay 
nearly $400 for books that I have 
not, and will not , usc in the near 
future. 

Yes, I agree that books are the 
key to our education , and reading 
is fundamental to our future, but 
couldn't they cost a little bit less 
than the horrendous, eye-popping, 
hair pulling prices they have now? 

According to studies that I have 
personally done with friends, 
roommates and classmates here at 
UCSD, the average college student 
with 12 to 18 units has an average 
book cost of$200 per quarter. This, 
I may add, includes the cost of so-
called "used" books. 

I myself paid around that much ' 
my first quarter, about $50 more 
my second quarter, and I do not 
even want to mention how much I 
will have to pay this quarter, with 
the 7 books that are required for 
my classes. 

With this fin ancial problem at 
hand, it is no wonder that many 
students resort to not taking a par-
ticular class because of the high 
cost of books, or are forced to keep 
renewing the same book at the 
library so they don't actually have 

to buy it. We should even b.: so 
lucky most of thl' tillll·. 

It is evident that th.: book cost 
on campus seems to ge t higher .1I1d 
highcr as time goes by. Whik SOIlll' 
classes require books that .Ire 
ncwly revised and cost around $90, 
other classes rcq u ire you to buy 
five books. which add up to ilroUlHi 
$100. The amount of money d col-
lege student has to pay for books. 
especially at a quarter-based school 
where we have to do it thrcl' tillles 
around , is absolu tely c1bsurd . 

It seems to me that there is 
some kind of mo ncy- making 
scheme that th e school is pl.ln nlllg 
to profit from books that colkgc 
students simply can't afford . Where 
exactly does the r~s t of our money 
go when a book priced at $80 is 
actually worth $40? And why don't 
professors, bookse ll ers and tht: 
school understand the fact that we 
are students who need as much 
financial help as possible? 

As if tu ition and room and 
board were nor bad enough, the 
cost of books has given us added 
financial pressure that we r~a lly do 
nor need. It is sad that we have to 
pay so much and be cheated from 
an institution that we greatly 
depend on for a highcr ed uca tion 

Now some may bc thi nking, 
"Well there are always thc used 
books, right?" Wrong. More and 
more professors arc tossing out th e 
old edi tions of books and requiring 
new editions the added features of 
which, usually, aren't used. Add the 
fact that when it comes to used

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Stealing Health frOln the Poor 
Bush 's administration has left many without adequate care 
By VISHAL PATEL 
Staff Woter 

Recdll about five months ago, a 
n:rtain change in our history 
nCCll ITl:d. The United States had 
<In l'il'ClIlln to find a leader for the 
world 's strongest free country. Do 
you recall one of the pressing 
issues. arguably the one that 
de termIned the result of the elec-
tion? Yes, I am talking about 
health care. 

Hcalth carc is a pressing issue; 
one that nceds to be dealt with 
IInmcdiatcly. The state of Florida, 
whIch played a large role in deter-
\lllning our president, and which 
.llso has d large elderly communi-' 
t\" cOllslden:d health ca re the 
101"l.'l1Iost issue in the 2000 presi-
denllal dection . So, the logical 
question that should come to 
mInd is this: How has one of the 
bIggest issues of the election been 
handled by our new President? 

I am sorry to report that noth-
ing successful has happened, and 
I fear nothing productive will hap-
pen SOOIl. Unfortunatdy, the 
administration of President Bush 
has takcn steps to thrust health 
carl.' into an abyss, des troying 
whal ex-PreSIdent Clinton 
<lllen:ptcd to accomplish by rnod-
erl ll zlI1g our system of ca rl.' . In his 
proposed budget, Presidelll Bush 
l.'ltmi natl.'s hea.lth care funding by 
86 percent tor programs that 
assis ted ill ci tizens who lack insur-
ance. The administration cited 
"efticlency" as the reason for the 
drastic cut in the program that 
helped the people who need help 
the IllOSt. 

Wow! What a drastic action by 
our presldellt. But we Illust give 
hllll crcdlt for trYll1g, right? Fur-

thermore, he must have a program 
he will institute that is more effi-
cient and a bener system for pro-
vidi ng health care. Sorry, I don't 
think so! 

President Bush's administra-
tion has ci ted no plan to alleviate 
the mounting need for assistance 
for the millions of people who do 
not have health insurance in our 
country. Furthermore, the plans 
that have been an nounced seem 
to mainly help the rich, a recur-
ring theme in the Bush adminis-
tration . I ·beg the president to 
rethink what he plans to do. 

Health care is not a privilege -
and 11 should not be - although it 
has become so in our capitalist 
society. Ultimately, health care 
relates to the right and ability to 
live. As I recall , this country was 
founded on the fact that everyone 
- every last human being - has 
the right to li fe. By giving one per-
son a better chance at living than 
another, one demeans the ethical 
basis of medical service that each 
of our doctors vows to accomplish. 

Thus, Bush's attempt to cut 
back the current health care sys-
tem IS a strategy amIss. Clearly, we 
shot,tld realize that Bush's budget 
cut tor health care is directly relat-
ed to his attempt to pass the 
largest tax cut in American histo-
ry. Drastic budget cuts are neces-
sary to implement the tax cut. In 
this tax cut, what Bush attempts 
to explain as giving back money to 
all Americans, one sees clearly that 
the rich of America will profit 
more. So, ultimately, Bush 's 
administration takes money from 
programs to help the poor and 
gives it to the rich. If only Karl 
Marx could see us now! 

This policy implemented by 

the president is incredibly mis-
placed. One should look to the 
countries whose health care is 
more successful than ours before 
implementing any plan that 
affects our citizens' health. 

Australia, with arguably the 
best health care in the world, is 
one such country. Australia pro-
VIdes health care to every citizen 
regardless of their type of insur-
ance, or lack thereof. A true 
socialistic program, Australia's 
health care system has been 
implemented to treat any person, 
no matter where they may be in 
the country or what their income 
is. 

Although the taxes in Australia 
are higher due to the govern-

m~nt's economic duties to pay for 
tillS program, universal health 
care helps not only to stimulate 
economy at lower levels of labor, 
but also at high-level, white-collar 
jobs. Also, citizens never have to 
worry about paying for medical 
service. Wealth is never an issue in 
treating the country. 

The United States must realize 
this, and fund such programs, 
rather than cut them. The class of 
citizens that mostly suffers from 
lack of health insurance is that of 
lower class laborers, who are the 
basis of our economy and produc-
tion. By providing for these peo-
ple, America benefits as a whole. 

Proponents of Bush's ac tions 
may cite the future as time for 
Bush to fix our health care system. 
However, as cited by the White 
l;iouse, future all otmen ts for 
health care will go mainly to 
research and training of doctors 
and nurses. This does nothing for

Editor: 
Regarding the Guardiall 's recent 

article ~gainst the University of 
Cahforl1la Student Association and 
the United States Student Associa-
tion referendum: The Guardian is 
entitled to its opinion, but I funda-
mentally disagree with the 
assumptions that formed that 
opinion. 

If you had called either the A.S. 
external office or USSA, you 
would have discovered that the 
USSA is not an independent lob-
bying organization, but a democra-
tically run coalition of college and 
university students, run by and 
accountable to its all -student 

membership. Each year, USSA 
member schools set the organiza-
tion 's action agenda, elect a presi-
dent and vice president and an all-
student board of directors, which 
meets every other month to run 
the organization. 

For 53 years, USSA members 
have worked to expand acc.ess to 
students' lives. In the p,ast year, 
the organization won a $450 
increase to the maximum amount 
awarded by the Pell Grant, the 
largest increase in history, and 
quintupled funding for campus 
child<:a re programs. USSA stu-
dents are currently working to get 
the interest that recent graduates 
pay on their studen t loans 
declared a tax credi t, which wou ld 
triple savings for the average stu-
dent. In addi tion to making col-
lege possible for thousands of 
low-income people, th ese suc-
cesses mean money in students ' 
pockets and are well worth 90 
cents per academic quarter. 

The Guardiall's primary reason 
for supporting a UCSA fee, but not 
a USSA fee, is that the UC Regents 
do not officially endorse USSA. I 
would argue this is actually a point 
that favors voting yes to USSA 
membership. Students and regents 
have different interests, so they 
should have different organizations 
working for them. 

For example, students have a 
~i~ect in:erest in knowing accurate 
II1tormal1on about violent crimes 
committed on or near ca mpus. 
Campus and system admi nistra-
tions, however, may want to sup-
press this information to maintain 
a good image. We agree and help

Senate meeting, or by talking 
with the author - me - who 
had explicit reasons for writing 
this amendment. 

The currently defined elegibil-
ity requirements of senator posi-
tions are not being followed, 
either by the A.S Councilor by 
the colleges. Why? The standards 
are vague and undefined. 

For instance, senators are sup-
posed to be chosen on the num-
ber of completed quarters at a 
university. But the wording does 
not indicate how many quarters 
are considered "freshman," 
·sophomore," etc. So, a fourth-
year senior could run for sopho-
more senator perfectly legally. 

I wrote this amendment to 
leave it up to the colleges to set 
their standards for selecting their 
senators. This is for three rea-
sons: First, it implies that the 
senators represent the colleges, 
and in A.S. Judicial Board hear-
ings when a college is trying to 
impeach a college senator with 
A.S. opposition, this helps define 
whose senator it really is,,Second, 
with the colleges setting their 
own standards of senator classifi-
cation , it allows for each college 
to determine the representative 

brains to incorporate them, the 
labor to build them and possibly 
even the audacity to use them? 
Given China's morbid human 
rights record and communist 
regime, it would be fool ish to 
si mply dismiss such a notion. 

Whether you wish to accept 
it, our nations are in competi -
tion. Our president says so, as 
does China's communist hierar-
chy, if not through words, then 
certainly through actions. From 
this perspective, it's tough to 
blame Rep ublican leaders for 
scrambling to build a missile 
defense. But then again, I've 
always classified Democrats as

nature of their senator. Third, 
appointments of senators would 
become standardized: With the 
implementation of this amend-
ment, colleges would make 
appointments based on a stan-
dard, instead of on ambiguous 
A.S. constitutional outlines 
which are not followed in the 
least. 

If this amendment fails, I 
encourage anyone to run in next 
year's election for any senator 
position. Even if you are told that 
elgibility depends on your Mclass 
standing with the university,' 
that is not what the current A.S. 
Constitution states, and that's 
exactly what I intended to 
change. 

I have previously sent letters to 
the editor being constructively 
critical of Guardian reporting, each 
letter done in fairness, but lazy 
reporting should be brought to 
the student body's atte ntion , 
especia lly when the Guardian 
claims it is providing a "service" to 
the student body by affirmatively 
or negatively endorsing candi-
dates and amendments. 

Thank you, and I challenge 
you to print this letter and let the 
students decide for themselves.

Bush 's first diplomatic chal-
lenge is a difficult one, without a 
doubt, almost unfair for a rookie. 
But the ball's in his cou rt ; the 
world is judging his diplomacy, 
because it was such a question 
mark during his campaign. I am 
confident in his skills as a diplo-
mat and a leader, especially in 
light of his highly experienced 
cabinet. 

Politics as ide though, I hope 
he succeeds because this may, for 
better or worse, have a signifi-

China.

books, the early bird catches the 
worm. Come one day late, and they 
are probably all gone. With all of 
these obstacles in place, it is no 
wonder that most students wind up 
buying new books at the full price. 

Another dilemma comes at the 
end of the quarter, when we have 
the opportunity to actually sell 
back the books we've bought, and 
for some of us, barely even used. 

Yes, we all know that little booth 
in the Price Center that takes those 
deadly weapons we call our study 
tools and gives us back a whole dol-
lar-and-a-half for some textbook 
that we have spent our life savings 
on. When it comes to selling back 
our used books, we are again faced 
with the fact that the editions we 
might have bought are going to be 
replaced the next quarter, and are 
worth nothing. We are left out of 
money, and out of a textbook about 
something we never understood in 
the first place. Sound familiar? 

Whining and bitching aside, it is 
obvious that we really can 't do any-
thing about how the textbooks are 
priced and how we can make them 
cheaper. What we can do, however, 
is re'sort to other ways of getting 
our required books without having

Books are almost always put on 

reserve in the library by professors, 
and some are even avai lable on the 
shelves. You can always check out a 
book from the library, renew it 
when you can, and return it when-
ever you are done. 

If you rea lly want the book to be 
actually yours, you can always go to 
Web sites such as http://www.ha/fcom 
where books are often much cheap-
er than their counterparts at the 
bookstore. There is also the Co-op, 
where some books are available for a 
few bucks cheaper. With these 
resources at hand, you don't have to 
pull your hair out every time you 
step foot in the bookstore. 

It is sad to say that high school 
days are long gone - days in which 
books came free, and the only 
money we spent was for the paper 
bags to cover them with. 

For now though, we are forced 
to pay an astonishing amount of 
money for textbooks, we have ft:w 
other choices. since it is part of the 
package we agreed upon when 
entering college. 

Indeed, there arc other options 
we can take when it comes to 
books at high prices, but \w do 
need them and they do expand our 
knowledge. Hopefully, with some 
miracle, books will be free for us

will fly) but until then, open up

"We spent two years thinking

Foschini. who has been in Miami

crime and kidnappings that feed 
on and flourish in a grinding civil 
conflict. many of Colombia's most 
promising young professionals 
and business peopk have reluc-
tantly abandoned this country in 

the hope of finding success and 
stability. 

In all, nearly 1.1 million of

up in the United States. which the 
Census Bureau estimates has a 
Colombian-American community 
of 435.000. 

The departure has meant more 
hopeful lives for innumerable 
families and a flow of money from 
abroad that is sure to help others 
who arc struggling. But the size of 

the departure has started to raise 
concerns about the long-term 
effects here, both to Colombia's 
economy and to its battered psy-
che. 

Some entrepreneurs and 
investors are liquidating businesses 
and laying off workers, contributing 
to an economic morass that helps 
to feed the social unrest that led to 
armed conflict in the first place. 

According to conservative esti-
mates by business organizations, 
the flight of capital - in closed 
bank accounts, investments and 
other assets - has reached $2 bil-
lion in two years, sizable in a 
country with a $90 billion gross 
domestic product. 

Perhaps most distressing, some 
Colombia experts and economists 
say. the migration is draining the 
best and brightest from the solid 
middle class. the kind of people 
the country sorely needs to help it

Gallo cha rdonnays and zinfan-
dds on the wine list, awarding 
Gallo almost Legion of Honor 
status. 

To promote that image. Gallo 
is not serving up the cheap jug 

wines that made the company 
wealthy. Rather, it is targeting the 
premium end of the market with 
wines that retail for up to 200 
francs a bottle, or about $28, 
imitating its successful drive in 
the United States to promote 
itself as a maker of fine wines,

Still. convincing Parisian

Only about 2 percent of all the

The campaign in France is part 
of a larger Gallo invasion of

Nexus: 
Slate confused by 
Marshall andA.S. rules 
Continued from page 3 

"We explained clearly Ito the 
rules committeel that we didn't 
know that it was against policy:' 
she said . 

Since the sla te was found in vio-
lati n of these rules, the case was 
taken t tht: rules committee by 
Marshall College Elections 
Manager Tricia Piers. 

"As soon as it was determined 
that they had committed. in exc~ss 
of two vio lations, they were diS-
qualified in accordance to the con-
stitution," she said. 

The eight candidates found 
guilty of the violations were each 
sentenced to 15 hours of commu-
nity service and an ethics workshop 
by Marshall College Dean Ashanti 
Houston Hands. 

Mer]1bers of the Nexus slate said 
they dispute the decision of the rl~les 
committee because two nonvotmg 
members, TMCSC Chair Emiko 
Burchill and TMCSC Rules 
Committee Chair Michelle Law. had 
approached Nibecker April 6 about 
literatllre the slate posted legally. 

These members approached the 
slate for their own personal rea-
sons, Piers said. 

"In IBurchili and Law'sl opin-
ions, some of the material posted 
on the Nexus fliers was slanderous 
to current committee members," 
Piers said. 

Members of the slate felt that 
their presence at the meeting was a 
conflict of interest. 

"In general, Marshall Council 
had expressed discontent about our 
campaign and the way that we called 
them into question," Nibecker said. 
"It's like having the victim of attack 
be the judge and jury." 

Piers said she disagreed that this 
was a factor in the decision. 

"The meeting we had was 100 
percent unbiased, and the decision 
Ithe committeel m<fde was strictly 
based 011 the constitution:' she said. 

In addition. Marshall College 
Residence Life policies do 110t fall 
directly in line with the elections 
policies of the A.S. Council. The 
candidates were given copies of 
both sets of rules. 

"There was a lot of confusion 
over when you follow A.S.'s rules 
and when you follow Marshall's," 
Scarpelli said. 

Piers said she regrets the timing 
of the rule discrepancy. 

"I don't know how many years 
these sets of rules have existed, con-
tradicting each other:' Piers said. "It's 
unfortunate that this had to come up 
during election week. We had to 
make do with two sets of rules." 

Allegations of policy violation 
were also brought against the 
Marshall Posse, the other Marshall 
college slate whose candidates are 
now all running unopposed. 

Members of the Nexus slate and 
another student accused the 
Marshall Posse of five posting vio-
lations, Piers said. Four of the accu-
sations were declared invalid by the 
rules committee. 

Another allegation that the 
Marshall Posse used a photocopied 
stamp was heard by the committee. 

The Marshall Posse slate was 
found innocent of any violation. 

"For various reasons, there was 
not enough evidence linking 
Marshall Posse to the violation: 
Piers said. 

The Nexus slate members 
appealed the decision to A.S. 
Elections Manager Vince Vasquez 
and to Piers. 

Vasquez said he had no jurisdic-
tion over the issue. 

"They appealed to me, asking 
that we look again at the allega-
tions against the Marshall Posse: 
Piers said. "However, the rules 
committee's decision is final." 

The members of the Nexus 
slate are not happy with this. 

"This college is so hyped up on 
diversity, and they went to great 
lengths to deny students diversity. of

Aerosmith 
"Just Push Play" 
'Sony/Columbia 

A-

It is rare when a rock 'n' roll band can 
mainta[n tame throughout generations. But 
every time my dad and I listen to the radio, 
Aerosmith always keeps us on the same sta-
tion. 

Emerging over 25 years ago, Arrosmith 
has defined the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. Along 
with immortal songs like "Walk This Way" 
came the fame, the power and the wome"n. 
Subsequently, internal conflicts and battles 
with sub~tance addiction were also present. 
Yet through the ups and downs, frontman 
Steven Tyler and his bandmates forged 
through long enough to be inducted into 
the Ro k 'N' Roll Hall of Fame on March 
19,2001. 

"Just Push Play" is the th irteenth studio 
album released by Aerosmith, and it is just 
what the fa ns have been waiting for: vintage 
Aerosmith mixed with more contemporary 
tunes. 

From begin ning to end, "Just Push 
Play" rocks. The fi rst single off the new 
album, "Jaded," is already climbing the 
charts faster than anything off their previ-
ous album, "Nine Lives." Again, "Jaded" 
rings true to the contemporary style Aero-
smith is mixing with their rock 'n' roll flair. 
"Light Inside" is one of the power ballads 
on the album, resonati ng with guitar-dri-
ven solos. 

When will Aerosmith stop releasing 
super kick-ass, yet classic, albums? My dad 
and I are keeping our fi ngers crossed that it . 
wO.n't be any time soon.

Rocket from the Crypt 
"Group Sounds" 

TVT !Vagrant Records 
A 

Three long years after their last studio 
release, San Diego rock band Rocket From 
the Crypt have th rown their fans a high-
energy, intense album that gets inside your 
mind and doesn't let go until you bite the 
head off a small furry creature (take it from 
me!). 

Rocket From the Crypt are a six-piece 
rock band, complete with a saxophone and 
trumpet. Their guitar riffs are very power-
ful and extremely catchy, and the horns 
serve to build up emotion in the songs. 
They are one of the hardest bands out 
there and have a very strong underground 
fol lowing. In fact, their Web site has pic-
tures of about a dozen people's Rocket tat· 

The UCSD Guardian HIATUS 11 

\ 
toos. 

The new album is much more reminis-
cent of their 1995 release, "The State of Art 
is on Fire," than of their most recent album , 
"RFTe." It is a lot louder and contains 
more simple, crunching guitar riffs than 
"RFTC." 

The names of their songs describe the 
vibe of the band, which include tracks such 
as "Heart of a Rat," "Return of the Liar" and 
"Ghost Shark." Songs that stand out on this 
album include "Whi te Belt," "Out of Con-
trol" and "Savoire Faire." 

The album doesn't experiment at all; 
instead, it is simply a rei teration of the 
group's old style. It is done very well, how, 
ever, and has been considered by many die-
hard fans to be their best album yet. Overall, 
it is an awesome fo llow up to a somewhat 
disappointing previous release. 

Run-DMC 
"Crown Royal" 
BMG/Artista 

B 

- David Pilz 

Before listening to Run-DMC's new 
release, "Crown Royal," my opinion of the 
trio was that they were old. These guys 
began when most of us were "terrible" (i.e. 
2-year-olds). I thought their style was the 
kind the Beastie Boys capitalized off of: one 
rapper fi nishes another's rhyme and the last 
word of the rhyme is shouted. 

That opinion changed at the sound of 
the opening song, titled "It's Over," which is 
probably the best track on the album. Jer-
maine Dupri talks over a haun ting choral 
piece, "Marcia Religioso; which was first 
used in "The Godfa ther III ." Run does the 
rapping, and it's the fast-flowing rap charac-
teristic of modern day. 

A few songs later, I realized that the 
album actually features a conglomeration 
of styles and talents, perhaps the sign of a 
group laced with success - Run-DMC 
was the first rap group to appear on MTV, 
"Saturday Night Live" and the cover of 
Rolling Stone. They've sold over 20 million 
albums. 

"Queens Day; featuring Nas, has an 
easy, relaxed pace to it, as does "Ahhh; fea-
turing Chris Davis. "Crown Royal; the title 
song, though not having the most catchy 
chorus, still fea tures great lyrics, attesting 
the group's right to the throne of rock. 
"Them Girls; sung partly by Limp Bizkit's 
Fred Durst, is a fun, comical song, though 
hearing the phrase "them girls" over and 
over may destroy your libido. 

The album contains several songs with 
more of a rock guitar sound than a rap song 
beat. "The School of Old; performed with 
Kid Rock, is the best of these because the 
tempo doesn't shift and Kid Rock's screams 
add to the entertainment. 

"Take the Money and Run; with Ever-
last, is done well but it's npt as good as the 
Steve Miller original. Another remake is 
"Let's Stay Together," a romantic song taken 
from AI Green. It's the same as the "Let's 
Get Married" song, if you've heard it. The 
beat is good, but how many times can a 
song be remade before it sounds like 
Michael Jackson? 

Both "Rock Show" with Stephan Jenk-
ins from Third Eye Blind a~d "Here We 
Go" are songs similar to the old-school 
style I expected of the group. "Ay Papi; 
featuring Fat Joe, adds a spicy Latin flavor 
and the flow is more modern and more

Java: 
Extensive lunch menu 
offers healthy alternative 
Continued from PICe 12 

The restaurant is delightfully 
small . with an intimate but casu-
al setting. When it is not busy, 
seating tends to be immediate 
and service prompt. A good 
number of locals eats there regu-
larly, so peak times can be backed 
up. 

You'll find a mix of business 
types and locals who find their 
way here for a very different kind 
of attitude about healthy food. 
During good weather, a small out-
door seating area makes for a 
lovely change in scenery. Ameni-
ties are kept very simple - paper 
napkins. paper menus and metal 

tabletops are as fancy as it gets. 
The highlight of the Mission 

Coffee Cup, sparsely decorated 
with a funky but retro '50s flare, is 
the food . All menu items are very 
affordable, the high-end being 
around seven or eight dollars for a 
"large lunch plate." 

The lunch menu is quite 
extensive, with many vegetarian 
options. Besides sandwiches, 
main dishes described as 
"health-Mex" and "health-Chi-
nese" are available. Ignore the 
connotations of the word 
"health;" these items are still very 
good. Everything is very hearty 
and fill s you up. You really get 
your money's worth. 

The breakfast selection, 
though limited, has been the focus 
of my experiences there. The cin-
namon French toast is especially 
good - light fluffy inside with 

The UCSD Guardian 

toasted edges. The mission pota-
toes. which come with eggs and 
squaw bread, are also good. [n 
addition, there is a power break-
fast menu that has very light ener-
gy foods. The Mission Coffee Cup 
also offers a wide array of coffee 
drinks that have as much flare as 
the food. 

Cuisine here has a simple ele-
gance that can be traced to owner 
Marla Reifs attitudes about 
healthy eating. The slogan on the 
back of her sweater says "Consci-
entious Cuisine: which is an 
accurate summary of her restau-
rant. Her intent is to sell food that 
is interesting to eat and see, and 
that is made with a health-con-
scious attitude. 

There is little dairy usage; 
perhaps two items [ noticed actu-
ally had sour cream. There is lit-

The Mission Coffee Cup in La

that name. The original Mission 
Coffee Cup sits on Mission Boule-
vard in Mission Valley. Both were

do with the original now. Reirs 
unique and eclectic take on cui-
sine has been at the La Jolla loca-
tion for almost five years. 

As of now. the Mission is open 
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., but Reif has 
plans to extend its hours of oper-
ation to include dinner. This will 
mean an entire new menu of sim-
ilar items.

pleasing to the ear. The song with 
the best beat is the last: "Simmons 
Incorporated," featuring Method 
Man. Sonically the song is very 
electronic and definitely intrigu-
ing. 

Though some songs don 't come

DMC's latest release proves that 
the group can still produce great 
music. 

- Eric Dean 

Halfbreed 
"Kontamination" 
Siccmade Muzicc 

A 

Eminem and Kid Rock are by 
far the most popular hip-hop 
artists to come out of Detroit, but 
they are in no way representative of 
what's really going on there. 

The real Detroit sound is in its 
underground rap scene. Many 
undiscovered artists are awaiting 
an opportunity to be heard. espe-
cially Halfbreed. 

Halfbreed, formerly known as 
House of Krazees. is comprised of 
rappers Sol and Skrapz. and thei r 
newest album. "Kontamination." is 
their best collaboration to date. 

Throughout the 21 tracks, Sol 
and Skrapz show off their versatili-
ty as artists and also their evolutjon 
as writers. 

"Don't Get Caught Up," and 
"Welcome To ... " represent your 
basic head-bobbing, smooth-style 
rap. Halfbreed embody a well-
established base thar allows them 
to branch out creatively. 

That creativity is' shown in 
".Kaoz." which spews intensity and 
has a heavy-metal feel to it that 
instantly gets you hyped. 

"Unstoppable" features raw. 
aggressive lyrics such as Skrapz's 

• intro verse: "Run away. I'm chas-
ing for your fears, and almost got 
'em in my possession, my sweat is 
your tears. Smoke clears, repen-
tance in the west side of bounds. 
disciplining wack MCs for all 10 
rounds." 

"What's Wrong With Me." 
·Porn Star" and the self-titled song 
"Halfbreed" con tain hypnotic 
beats. and mix in many intriguing 
sound effects. Prevalent are futuris-
tic. robotic noises. people scream-
ing, and howling whistles. 

It 's important to stress that this 
genre of music is not mainstream 
"TRL." Jay-Z or P-Diddy. It's a 
style all its own. It 's hardcore, 
intense and wicked, and it reflects 
Sol's and Skrapz's views of soci-
ety. It is horro!;:core rap at its 
finest. 

Also, like many of Detroit's 
underground artists such as 
Natas, Esham and Project Born . 
Halfbreed say they make music for 
their fans. not for money. They're 
interested in quality and content 
rather than flashiness and notori -

Softball 
Downs 
Stanislaus 
Tritons sweep CCAA 
top squad at home 
By GLORIA CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's softball 
team got down to business on 
Sunday in two key games over Cal 
State Stanislaus in a California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
competition. 

[n the first game of the double-
header. Leea Harlan tossed the 
entire seven innings and shut out 
the CCAA leaders. Harlan allowed 
just three hits and struck out five. 

In the fifth inning. the Tritons 
scored their two runs of the game 
when Harlan helped her own 
cause. bringing in Kim Aggabao 
and Jeanine Cordero with a double 
to left center. With the win, Harlan 
brought her season record to 10-5. 
winning 2-0 

UCSD assistant coach Becky 
Newbry praised the Triton ace's 
performance in the circle and at the 
plate. 

"She's one of our leaders on the 
field ." Newbry said. "When Leea 
'plays well. the team plays well." 

In the following game, Christi 
Martinelli was in the circle for the 
Tritons and followed up a domi-
nant pitching performance from 
Harlan in the first game. 

Stanislaus struck first in the top 
of the first inning, getting three hits 
and scoring once. The Warriors 
scored again in the top of the third 
inning when Stani5laus centerfield-
er Jamie Harkins hit a horne run to 
center field . 

in the bottom of the third 
inning, UCSD tied things up. A 
hit from Samantha Hayes loaded 
the bases for the Tritons . . Two 
fielding errors by the Warriors put 
Aggabao and Amy Mettee on 
base. Cordero drove in Aggabao 
and Mettee to even the score at 2-
2. 

. Two innings later, the 'Tritons 
scored the game-winning run . 
Mettee led off the inning with a 
single and advanced to third base 
when' the Warriors committed 
another error. Mettee crossed the 
plate on a sacrifice fly from 
Cordero. 

Newbry feels good about the 
team's two important wins. 

"We played great. and we 
deserved to win," she said. "It was a 
great confidence builder and we 
know that we are in control of our 
own destiny." 

The sweep over Stanislaus 
brought the 'Tritons' record to 20-
11 -1 overall and 13-8-1 in CCAA. 

UCSD now travels to UC Davis 
and Chico State for two double- ' 
hea'd ~s this weekend. 

. "We have a differe~t f?cus going 
mto the Newport [nvltatlonal." Fil-
ippone said. "Our practices have 
changed; we are racing the novice 
teams against each other and are 
not racing the varsity eight boat in 
the tournament. [ hope to get a top 
performance from our varsity eight 
and varsity four-boats." 

The goal of the men 's squad 
next year is to win the Cal Cup and 
Weste.rn Intercollegiate Rowing 
ASSOCiation Championship. but the 
underlining achievement would be 
to make it to the Division II Cham-
pionships at the end of the season. 

"The objective would be to have 
the novice eight team dominate, our 
varsity four team to win the Pac 10 
and the novice lightweight team to 
capture the W1RA Championship. 
We want to get UCSD back to the 
prominent level it was a year ago, 
with confident rowers and achieve-
ment following: said Filippot\e.

Golf Fails to Shine in 
Arizona Desert 
Tritons trip up at Thunderbird Invitational In 
Phoenix, finish 16th out of 18 schools 
By GLORIA CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team showed 
improvement against tough com-
petition at the Grand Canyon Un i-
versityrrhunderbird Invitational in 
Phoenix. Some notable schools 
participating included crosstown 
rival San Diego State University, 
Cal State Stanislaus and the Uni-
versity of Utah. 

On the first day of competition, 
Grand Canyon University, the host 
school, blew away the opponents, 
finishing the day at 18 under par. In 
contrast, the lhtons found them-
selves at the bottom of the stand-
ings after the first day at 38 over 
par. Darin Sullivan fared the best 
for UCSD, with six over par. Not

Continued from pall. 20 

The best match was at No.3 
doubles, where O'Neil and Mary 
Hung played tough and eventually 
came out on top, 8-6. 

In singles, the doubles duo of 
Liao and Westerman split up to 
give the Tritons their lone two vic-
tories. Liao continued her hot sin-
gles streak by winning at No.3 sin-
gles. She won the first set in a tie-
breaker and was then up 4-0 before 
her opponent retired due to injury. 

Westerman had a tougher time 
of it in her match at No. 5 singles. 
After posting a fairly convincing 6-
2 victory in the first set, she lost the 
second by a score of 4-6. Despite 
the setback, she regained her 
momentum in the third set and 
claimed a 6-4 victory to take the 
match. 

Also of note in the match was 
Hung's performance at No. 6 sin-
gles. Hung came out smoking and 
took the first set 6-0 before falling 
in three sets. 

LaPlante was disappointed with 
the loss, but not disheartened . 

"They were ranked No. 6 
nationally and most of their players 
were international players on a full 
ride: LaPlante said. "They were 
very good. We wanted to see what 
the top of Division II looked like 
and we were right there with them. 
They are a very beatable team: 

On Wednesday the Tritons 
hosted San Francisco State Univer-
sity. Although the final score was 7-
2, the score d<les not do justice to 
the whipping the Tritons gave their 
guests. 

The competition in doubles was 

far behind him was Greg Wilson at 
nine over par. 

In the final day of competition 
on the April 10, the Triton golfers 
put in a much better performance 
and finished the Invitational 16th 
out of 18 competitors. UCSD com-
pleted the tournament 61 over par . . 

Grand Canyon University con-
tinued its dominance and brought 
home the tournament win after 
holding off a resilient Stanislaus 
team. Mark Lawless of Stanislaus 
finished at 10 under par and edged 
out John Davis and Andy Davis of 
Grand Canyon University for 
medalist honors.

an absolute laugh fest. All three 
Triton teams were off the COlirt in 
under half an hOllr and all three 
posted 8-0 shutouts. 

Singles wasn't much better. 
Because of class conflicts, the Tri-
tons were unable to field an entire 
team. They were forced to forfeit. 
the bottom two singles spots, and 
this was the only way that San 
Francisco stood a chance of getting 
points. 

With injuries to Tadlock and 
O'Neil keeping them out, the team 
had to shift positions. Liao played 
No. 1 and had no problem filling in 
the shoes of the Triton superpow-
ers. Liao had only two game points 
against her, and she saved those en 
route to a 6-0, 6-0 victory. 

Kristina Jansen played No. 2 for 
the Tritons and also posted an 
impressive 6-0, 6-0 double bagel 
on her opponent. 

Westerman had the dubious 
distinction of giving up the only 
game for the lTitons that day. Nev-
ertheless, she was still off the court 
first with an easy 6-0, 6-1 win . 

Jaime Walker, a seldom-used 
reserve for the Tritons, took full 
advantage of the playing opportu-
nity and smashed her opponent 6-
0,6-0. 

After an away match against 
Point Lorna Nazarene next 
Wednesday, the meat of the Tri-
tons' schedule rea lly begins. They 
have the California Collegiate Ath-
letic Association Championship 
Tournament the weekend after 
that, and the weekend of April 20-
21 the Tritons go to the Ojai Tour-
nament. This contest helps deter-
mine the individual champions in 
Division II and other divisions. 

From there the Tritons move on 
to regionals and nationals. Good 
luck to you tennis phenoms as you 
strive for that next level.

not be the best player in the 
league. It will break my heart to

have stood a chance against Jor-

Not only will it break the

T he rumor is on the lips of basketball fans everywhere. "SportsCenter" broadcasts 
daily updates, presenting different 
opinions from ex-players, owners, 
basketball executives, all the way 
down to the cheerleaders. 

"Michael Jordan is comi ng 
back," they whisper. The words 
spread like wi ldfire through class-
rooms, offices and bars across the 
nation, fueled by children and 
adults, men and women, janitors 
and executives alike. 

On every sports show, the 
rumor comes before the basketball 
playoff race, the hockey scores, the 
baseball highlights, even before the 
death of Willie Stargell. 

"The king is coming. His Air-
ness is gonna return ." 

Yes, tha t's right, unless you've 
been locked in your basement 
with your head up your ass fo r 
the last week you know it is 
rumored that Jordan is coming 
back to play for the Washington 
Wizards next year. 

According to reports, Jordan 
will join Charles Barkley, who is 
also coming out of retirement. 
Even Chris Webber recently said 
he wouldn't mind going to Wash-
ington to play with Jordan. 

And monkeys might fly out of 
my butt. 

If Jordan came back today, 
there's no doubt that he would 
have a positive impact on any team 
he plays for. 

His leadership, coupled with 
the type of players he would attract 
to the WIZards, could do wonders 
for the struggling Washington 
team. But it's not gonna happen. 

He wouldn't be the top player 
' in the game, and there's no way 
his pride could handle getting 
beaten by young kids like Kobe 
Bryant. In his prime, he could 
handle anybody, but he is well 
past his prime and two years 
removed from professional bas-
ketball . His workouts with the 
Wizards and health club basket-
ball endeavors don't come close 
to simulating a live NBA game 
and he knows it. 

Jordan, who helped spread the 
rumors by refusing to comment 
un til recently, reiterated his views 
on returning as still "99.9 per-
cent" unlikely. When Jordan 
retired, he wanted to retire on 
top, as the best player in the 
game, which he did by sinking the 
game-winning shot to propel the 
Bulls to their sixth championship. 
If he did come back, he would not 
leave basketba ll on top, because 
the Wizards need about five Jor-
dans to come even close to being 
a playoff team, let alone a cham-
pionship team . 

No, Jordan is not coming back 
to the NBA, although it would be 
a handy excuse to divest his par-
tial ownership of the Wizards. 
This rumor is being fanned by 
fellow Wizards owner Abe Pollin, 
who no doubt is part of this 
treachery. This rumor has one 
sole purpose, and that is to attract

PORTS 
Women's Tennis PU.ts the Hurt On 
Tritons knock San Francisco State 7-2 on Wednesday 
By BIU BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis team essential-
ly took a tour of Division (( last weekend and 
earlier this week. During the weekend, the Tri-
tons played in the Cal Poly Pomona Invitation-
al, a tournament that boasted some of the best 
teams in the country. From there the Tritons 
went on to play league rival San Francisco 
State University, a team that wasn't fit to hold 
the Tritons' water bottles. . 

Over this spa n, UCSD went 2-1 to improve 
their overall record to 11 -5 . The victory over 
San Francisco ran their conference record to 
7-1. 

The Tritons' first match was on Saturday 
against Grand Canyon University. UCSD had 
defeated Grand Canyon earlier in the year, but 
head coach Liz LaPlante was riot overly confi-
dent. 

"I wasn't worried, because we beat them 
8-1 earlier this season ," LaPlante said; "but 

they had a different line up this time. They had 
just gone 5-4 with Davis." 

In the end , LaPlante had nothing to fear. 
Her team walked away with a 7-2 victory. 

Things got off on the right foot for the Tri-
tons as they pulled off a sweep in doubles to be 
up 3-0 going into the singles competition. 

"Their teams were tough , but for the first 
time all season all three douBles teams played 
great," Laplante said. 

The most exciting of the three matches was 
at the top. Lyndsey Tadlock and Stephanie 
Moriarty lost six of the first seven games and 
were on the verge of collapse when they turned 
it all around. They went on a tear from there 
and took the pro set 9-7. 

In singles, as is often the case, the Tritons' 
depth proved to be the deciding facto r. Ashley 
O'Neil won a three-set match at No. 1 singles 
and Tadlock lost a three-setter at No.2. 

The Tritons won three of the bottom four 
matches to cinch the match. 

The victory sent UCSD to the winners' 
bracket, and after its second-round match was 
rained out, the Tritons played Barry College of 
Florida on Sunday.

UCSD Rows a.t San :Diego Championships 
Triton crew makes waves at one of the largest rowing events 
By ARYIND YUAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD men's and women's 
crew competed in the annual San 
Diego Crew Championships on 
the weekend of April 7-8. 

The competition put together 
the top teams in the nation, with 
universities from around the 
country taking to the water to see 
how they ranked among their fel -
low collegiate athletes. 

Both men's and women's teams 
placed high in many events, which 
shows the improvement this 
squad bas made since the begin-
ning of the year. 

In the women's collegiate light-
weight heat A, UCSD placed third 
behind Princeton University and 
University of South Florida. In the 
men's collegiate novice heat B, 
UCS D placed fifth behind the 
top-ranked Huskies of the Uni-
versity of Washington . In the 
men 's junior varsity heat A, the 
Tritons finished sixth behind their 
rivals from UC Berkeley. The 
women's collegiate novice heat A 
proved to be a tough race as the 
girls came up short against San 

Diego State University to take fifth 
overall. 

Both UCSD alumni teams 
placed fourth in their respective 
ht:ats, challenging teams such as 
UC Berkeley and University of 
Southern California. The women's 
A and B teams placed fourth and 
fifth, respectively, in their open 
heats. 

Sunday showcased the Tritons' 
ability to be competitive in all the 
races in which they participated. 
In the women's open petite final, 
UCSD captured the crown by . 
defeating the Gauchos from UC 
Santa Barbara. 

The men's open petite, howev-
er, did not fare as well, as the B 
team placed fifth and the A team 
sixth, losing by 24 seconds to the 
low-performance all-stars. The 
men's cal cup petite team did 
excellently, placing a close second 
- only six seconds behind the 
crew from the University of Puget 
Sound in Washington. 

With only three participants in 
the men 's junior varsity petite, the 
team from UCSD fought hard but 
placed third with a time of 
07:08.25, only a few seconds

The last race, the prestigious 
A.W. Coggeshal Cup, is the 
women's collegiate lightweight 
grand final. As predicted, the Triton 
women's crew was a participant in 
this event. The race was long and 
arduous, and the team finished with 
a time of 07:54.22 and fourth place 

overall. The eventual winners were

what is your favorite thing about the student center? 

MIKE FLYNN 
warren, 3rd year 

There are a lot of 
student run 
businesses here, like 
no other Student 
Center. They offer 
great opportunities 
for students and 
good prices for 
books and food. 

STEVE AYALA 
muir, 4th year 

I like to drink beer in 
the PUb, and I like 
Groundwork Books 
because their books 
are progressive and 
socially conscious. 

poetry slamm 

MIKEAZGOUR 
muir, 4th year 

It has a good vibe, 
no big buildings, 
lots of trees, a sense 
of history, and art. 

YANAR BEHlADI 
revelle, 4th year 

It is a quiet and cool 
place away from the 
Price Center. Things 
are inexpensive and I 
always run into my 
friends here. 

DAN SCHANK 
IJad sIlJderI, vis arts 
It is an alternative to 
the Price Center. The 
food is better, not 
fast food, nice coffee 
shops, nice environ-
ment, and the only 
sign of political 
activity on th is cam-
pus. 

Poetry Slamms are reviving the art of the spoken word and introducing a new form of expression to stu-
dents 'on college campuses. In response to the emergence of this literary event, the University Centers 
Programming Board is putting together it's own series of Poetry Slamms this quarter. 

Poetry Slamm is a lyrical battle of rhythm and rhyme. Students have an opportunity to share their poet-
ry, spoken word, rap, etc. in a fun and creative atmosphere. To perform, simply come and sign up the 
night of the event. Five people from the audience wi ll be picked at random to score each poet's per-
formance. The battling poets will have th ree minutes to perform with a ten second grace period. The 
judges will give scores, and after each poet's performance, the audience is free to give their reactions. 
Poets are encouraged to bring costumes or props to better communicate their ideas. Poetry Slamm 
takes place every Wednesday starting Apri l 11th (with the exception of April 25th), at 7:00pm, in Porter's 
Pub located in the Student Center. Poets from throughout San Diego will be invited to share their pieces. 
Participation is free and open to everyone!

wanted " or "roommate available" listings on our website. You can also download sample forms such as 
leases, roommate agreements and more. If you are looking for a vacant house, condo or apartment, click 
on "Search off-campus housing listing" to view available rentals in the campus community. The housing 
market is tight and is getting more expensive so if rents seem too high, then find a roommate with whom 
you can share a room. The key is to plan ahead, think creatively and be persistent. Off Campus Housing
