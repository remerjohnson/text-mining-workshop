A eucalyptus tree crashed into 
the side of Thurgood Marshall 
Apartments Building C around 4 
p.m. Monday, shattering a window 
and puncturing the wall. Police and 
fire officials responded shortly after 
and evacuated the building. 

Although tree branches broke 
a woman’s bedroom window, 
Thurgood Marshall Resident Dean 
Yolanda Trevino said no bodily injury 
occurred as a result of the accident. 

“We were fortunate that we did 

not have any injuries as well as [only] 
minor damage,” Trevino said. “If [the 
tree] had leaned more and the trunk 
had fallen on the building, it would 
have taken out all the apartments 
because of the weight.”

According to Steve Thompson, 
associate director of maintenance, 
housing and dining, the tree branches 
hit a length of piping on the outside 
of the building, damaging a fire sprin-
kler system that serves two bedrooms 
and punching a hole through the wall. 

Assistant Director of Facilities 
Management Charles Morgan said 
the damage was a result of internal 
decay mostly at the base of the tree 
and most likely caused by a fungus.

“With the right circumstances 
 — the right wind, right weight on 
the tree — it could happen to any 
tree anywhere in San Diego County,” 
Morgan said. “There’s almost no real 
signs. We could never know until it 

falls down and we look inside.”
Trevino said the three residents 

whose rooms were damaged have 
been temporarily relocated to other 
open spaces in Thurgood Marshall 

College and are expected to return to 
their rooms by Friday.

The UC Board of Regents appoint-
ed two new chancellors last week at 
UC San Francisco and UC Davis.

UCSF Chancellor-designate Susan 
Desmond-Hellmann and UC Davis 
Chancellor-designate Linda Katehi 
— both appointed based on UC 
President Mark G. Yudof ’s recom-
mendation — will take their posi-
tions Aug. 3 and Aug. 17, respectively, 
after a year-long search for qualified 
candidates. 

They will replace UCSF’s J. 
Michael Bishop, who has served as 
chancellor since 1998, and UC Davis 
Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, who 
has presided since 1994.

“Both [Desmond-Hellmann and 
Katehi] are considered trophy chan-
cellors,” UC Office of the President 
spokesman Peter King said. “They’re 
a blend of academic leadership and 
managerial skills, and they’re bona 
fide scientists.”

Desmond-Hellmann — who 
ranked 87th on Forbes magazine’s
“100 Most Powerful Women in the 
World” last year — is the first woman 
to be named UCSF chancellor and 
will receive a $450,000 annual salary, 
up from Bishop’s $402,200 salary.

The 51-year-old chancellor-desig-
nate earned her medical degree at the 
University of Nevada, Reno before 

No injuries reported 
after 90-foot-tall 
eucalyptus breaks 
through undergrad’s 
window.

The freshly seated A.S. Council has 
its sights set on an A.S. student store, 
which it hopes to unveil in Spring 
Quarter 2010 before the Sun God 
Festival rush. 

The store would carry A.S.- and 
Greek-related merchandise to pro-
mote council events like Bear Gardens, 
and give fraternities and sororities a 
convenient location to buy letters. 

“Students like to identify with 
icons that are a part of their student 
life and we are working to capital-
ize on that,” A.S. Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Peter Benesch 
said. “With the proposed steady flow 
of income from Greek apparel, it is a 

very responsible way to lower student 
fees by capitalizing on student needs.”

According to Benesch, the bear 
mascots created by the A.S. Graphic 
Studio are wildly popular, and he said 
he believes apparel with the images 
would sell.

“When we put up the bear post-
ers on campus, they would be stolen 
in a couple hours,” he said. “People 
thought they were so cute. That is also 
a consistent trend with the baby Sun 
Gods.”

In addition to improving A.S. 
Council visibility and promoting cam-
pus community, A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta said the enterprise would yield 
a profit for the council, reducing its 
dependence on the quarterly $47.82 
activity fee that students pay.

Although the council has discussed 
an A.S. store for years, the idea gained 
momentum when councilmembers 
realized the Price Center expansion 
would provide space for the venture. 
Gupta said there is currently no busi-
ness model for such an enterprise.

“The business plan needs to be 
tackled, and made sure that it is prof-
itable both fiscally and economically,” 
Gupta said.

Benesch said he will draft this plan 
over the summer and begin talks with 
University Centers — which oversees 
Price Center’s retail space — at the 
beginning of Fall Quarter 2009. He 
estimated that the issue would not 
reach the council floor for discussion 
until three or four weeks into the 
quarter. 

University Centers Advisory Board 
President Lana Blank said the best 
retail spot to support the Greek com-
munity is the location of the A.S. 
Programming Office’s current Sun 
God mini-store, between the box 
office and Jamba Juice.

“It would make sense to have the 
A.S. store there because lots of Greek 
activity happens in the center of cam-
pus, but it is also an expensive place 
[in terms of rent] compared to most,” 
Blank said.

The council will use retail statis-
tics from the Sun God mini-store to 
determine which merchandise would 
sell best in the permanent enterprise, 
Benesch said.

completing her residency at UCSF. 
She also served as an assistant profes-
sor of hematology and oncology at 
UCSF for two years. 

“The most 
important thing 
to me throughout 
my entire career … 
has been to work 
on things that truly 
matter for patients, 
and this new role 
has the potential to 
make an even larger 
impact on patients 
through all aspects 
of UCSF’s mis-
sion,” Desmond-
Hellmann said in a 
statement.

She joined Genentech, a leading 
biotechnology corporation, as a clini-
cal scientist in 1995, and was named 
executive vice president of develop-
ment and product operations in 1999. 
Her annual salary at Genentech was 
$725,666, not including $1.3 million 
she earned in bonuses.

“[Desmond-Hellmann] took a big 
pay cut to come back to a place that 

changed her life,” King said.
UCSF is currently finalizing plans 

for the construction of a new hospital 
in Mission Bay to serve children, 
women and cancer patients.

“Susan has the 
credentials to help 
ensure that the uni-
versity [is a] major 
player in reshaping 
the nation’s health-
care environment,” 
Yudof said in a 
statement. “And 
she has the know-
how and leadership 
skills to make sure 
the Mission Bay 
hospital is a suc-
cess.” 

UC Davis Chancellor-designate 
Katehi, 55, is the current provost and 
vice chancellor of academic affairs at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. 

Prior to joining UIUC, Katehi was 
the John A. Edwardson dean of engi-
neering at Purdue University, and the 
associate dean for academic affairs 
at the University of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor. 

“She is a brilliant academic with 
experience at three Big-10 universi-
ties,” Yudof said. “She understands 
the mission and aspirations of a mul-
tidisciplinary, land-grant institution 
… and she comes from the UC fam-
ily.”

Katehi will earn $400,000 annu-
ally as the UC Davis chancellor, a 12.4 
percent increase from the current 
$356,00 she makes at UIUC and an 
$85,000 increase from her predeces-
sor’s salary.

Katehi earned a bachelor’s degree 
in electrical engineering from the 
National Technical University in 
Athens, Greece, and received both 
her master’s degree and doctorate 

from UCLA’s electrical engineering 
department.

She has received 16 U.S. pat-
ents, and is a member of the 
National Academy of Engineering. 
Katehi was also selected by former 
President George W. Bush to chair 
the National Medal of Science com-
mittee.

Both Katehi and Desmond-
Hellmann will receive university-pro-
vided housing and an $8,916 annual 
automobile allowance. In addition, 
Katehi will be given a $100,000 relo-
cation allowance.

The newly elected A.S Council’s inagural meet-ing was a welcoming and 
instructional affair.

Shanna Dayan of the Student 
Health Advocates presented the 
“Sun God Says” campaign, and 
brought a box full of T-shirts as a 
gift to incoming councilmembers. 
The T-shirts, designed by the A.S. 
Graphic Studio, bear catchy phrases 
including “Who you gonna call ... 
A.S. Safe Rides.”

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny 
Rue greeted the 
new council and 
offered a presen-
tation chock full 
of wise words for 
the new council.

“My aspira-
tion for every student is that you 
have a niche, that you have a group 
of people you bond with — your 
peeps if you will,” Rue said. “It’d be 
great if A.S. can be a bonding group 
for you, but it’s also to reach out to 
create new alliances, to create part-
nerships where partnerships didn’t 
exist before.”

For the council’s benefit, 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Frank Carroll handed out 
plastic water bottles that listed the 
“Top 5 things you should know if 
you are questioned/arrested at Sun 
God” before he played a 15-minute 
instructional DVD on knowing your 
rights as an individual and how to 
deal with police. 

The information and bottles 
come at a welcome time, given that a 
council resolution passed earlier this 
year decrying the use of disposable 
water bottles prompted a decision 
by A.S. Concerts and Events not to  
distribute free water bottles at this 
year’s festival.

A.S. Speaker Jordan Taylor 
added the appointment of his suc-
cessor to new business and proceed-
ed to pander his current position by 
listing his various duties.

Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund and former Revelle College 
Council Chair James Lintern both 
graciously accepted their nomina-
tions for the job. Then each made his 
case to be voted on by the council. 

Haglund cited his experience 
in helping to construct the by-
laws within Pi Kappa Alpha and 

his involvement 
with Judicial 
Affairs on the 
InterFraternity 
Council. He 
explained that he 
would increase  
council efficiency 

by cutting down on the side chatter 
in the A.S. Forum.

Lintern listed his own experi-
ences — serving on Revelle College 
Council, serving on the Standing 
Rules committee and the Gaza 
Resolution Committee, and the two 
times he stepped in for an absent 
Taylor. Since he is not a member of 
the council, he would not have a vote 
if there were a tie.

“College chairs are very used to 
not choosing sides,” Associate Vice 
President of Academic Affairs Lana 
Blank pointed out in the discussion 
that followed each nominee’s pre-
sentation.

After the council’s brief delibera-
tion, Lintern re-entered the forum to 
the news and appropriate applause 
that he had been elected to the posi-
tion.

During open forum Campuswide 
Senator Alex Vu encouraged every-
one to prepare for the ninth week 
budget meeting and to stay informed 
via the e-mail listserv.

“We want to see how successful 
this merchandising is for Sun God and 
build off that success,” he said. “With 
an A.S. store, we could see what’s 
working well and what’s in our busi-
ness interest for the future.”

Benesch said he envisions keep-
ing the enterprise student run, since 
paying for a professional managerial 
position would pose a huge financial 

burden.
Gupta added that if students 

remain in charge of business opera-
tions, there will be financial incentives 
for student customers to support the 
shop.

“It’s a student-run enterprise, 
meaning that any profits generat-
ed by the store would go back to 
the student body in some way or 
form,” he said. “It’s different from the 

Bookstore because the profit gener-
ated there isn’t seeing a return to the 
student body.”

Benesch said the council’s initial 
investment in shelving units, sig-
nage, merchandise and advertising 
for the store would cost roughly 
$150,000.

Dear Editor,

I am a junior at UCSD, currently 
studying abroad in Padova, Italy.

A decision was recently made 
to close the Education Abroad 
Program study center in Padova 
at the end of June. I, along with 
the other UC students studying in 
Padova and the ladies who work 
in the study center, are very upset 
about this decision, and I feel it is 
news that should be presented to the 
UCSD community. 

For starters, despite numerous 
suggestions made by the study cen-
ter’s employees (including cutting 
their hours and two of the four 
staff members) the UC system has 
decided that the most “economically 
feasible” option is to close the center 
altogether.

This decision was announced 
only after students had made depos-
its and arrangements to come to 
Padova next fall. Next fall, only one 
employee will work in the study 
center, and she will be entirely 
responsible for the work that four 
employees took on this year. 

The students going to Padova in 
the fall have been deceived. They 
will pay the same amount that I am 
paying right now, but will receive 
almost none of the support or ben-
efits of having a fully operational 
study center.

The study center is an integral 
part of the study-abroad experience. 

The ladies there help students with 
mundane tasks (such as telling us 
where we can find a hair straight-
ener, or what a certain medicine 
might be called in Italian), to real-
ly important issues (psychological 
issues, transferring units and classes 
from the University of Padova to 
our home campuses and many more 
things).

One lady told us that a few 
years ago, a student was robbed on 
Christmas, and she drove an hour 
to pick her up and take her back 
to her house, give her some money 
and help her through that tough 
experience.

These ladies really care about us, 
and they make us feel more at home 
in a foreign country. It’s a good feel-
ing to know that even though you 
are on your own in a foreign coun-
try, there is still someone looking 
out for you.

It is impossible for one woman to 
do all of this (plus organize accom-
modations, help with class sched-
ules, explain the Italian university 
system, etc.) for 30 students.

There is more than just finances 
going into this decision. 

The office space that the Padova 
study center uses is rent-free, as the 
office is owned by the University of 
Padova. Therefore, the University 
of California is only paying for four 
salaries (three of which are part-
time).

Padova must be one of the more 
economically viable EAP programs 
as there is clearly no lack of interest 
in the program. Many UC students 

are coming to Padova in the fall, 
with Italian students going to UC 
campuses in their place.

If you have any questions, please 
don’t hesitate to e-mail me, or check 
out the Save the EAP Padova Center 
Facebook group.

Dear Editor,
Delivering pizzas to the One 

Miramar Street graduate student 
housing complex is always a frus-
trating experience. I have yet to 
find the desired address within one 
drive down the street. It often takes 
a back-and-forth flashing of the 
brights on a couple of startled grads 
to locate the four wooden numbers. 

Dim yellow lights in cheap bul-
bous spheres leak a thin sheet of 
comfort on the apartments. The 
shrubs, grassy knolls, gravelly 
driveways and cracked concrete 
walkways weave in and out of the 
splotchy luminance.

Walking across the lawn, I real-
ized two things. One: the grass had 
recently been watered (damn my 
hole-ridden work shoes). Two: this 
would be a good place to rape some-
body. 

Where there is darkness, there is 
a greater likelihood of illicit activ-
ity. The grad student housing is 
dark, dingy and damp. When a five-

minute pizza drop off gets me look-
ing behind my back (no matter how 
neurotic I might be by nature), I 
take that as a sign there is a definite 
problem to be addressed.  

Grad students aren’t the only 
ones in danger, either.

A lot of undergraduate students 
walk from the east and Regents 
parking lots to their homes around 
University Town Center, and that 
entire edge of campus is a poorly lit 
catwalk of young collegians. Take 
your pick, creepy hat-wearing guy 
from the campus alert drawings,  it’s 
a smorgasbord of potential victims!   

So now I’ll put forth a solution: 
Install some fluorescent bulbs near 
that street and around the grad stu-
dent housing!

To protect the safety and com-
fort of our own (namely the women 
who live here), I’m sure the univer-
sity will agree that we can spare no 
expense.

The Sun God Festival is tomor-row! This year’s bash comes in the wake of a festival over-
haul, the likes of which students were 
largely unhappy with. But the A.S. 
Concerts and Events Office has made 
some much-needed tweaks — like 
getting rid of that damned be-there-
by-7-p.m. requirement and replacing 
it with all-day in-and-out privileg-
es. And booking a lineup that takes 
a grand step toward the pages of 
Sun God lore, with an all-around 
increase in entertainment and, acts 
that students can get excited about. 
Not only did Concerts and Events 
prepare what will surely be the best 
dance party RIMAC Field has seen 
in far too long, the office lovingly — 
or perhaps just fearing riots — has 
transformed the weeks leading up to 
this Friday into a snowballing count-
down party.

By calling upon the new A.S. 
Graphic Studio and social-network-
ing Web site Twitter to bring momen-
tum to the baby Sun God campaign, 
and planning a week of Price Center 
nooner shows, Concerts and Events 
has crafted an unprecedented pref-
estival buzz. And its promise is one 
that the office looks to follow through 
on, collaborating with the Loft for 
fixtures like a cupcake tree, film tent 
and free photobooth, and with the 
Music Saves Lives group to set up a 
Motion City Soundtrack meet-and-
greet in exchange for Wednesday’s 
blood drive. Concerts and Events has 
also embraced the student-fostered 
tradition of wearing a costume to 
campus the day of Sun God; there 
will be a “secret spotter” scanning the 
crowd, and those with the best outfit 
will be invited to dance on stage with 
Girl Talk.

But the changes could also mean 
some kinks. Festival wristbands 
(which will be made of fabric and 
ooze with hipstery slick-designed 

hipness) will be passed out all day 
at the tennis courts on Ridge Walk. 
And while Associate Vice President 
of Concerts and Events Garrett Berg 
is confident that the 24-lane setup 
will be prepped to handle any line 
with robotic efficiency, students can 
believe it when they see it. With a 
capacity of about 20,000, the field 
admittedly isn’t big enough for every-
one and guest tickets sold out on 
Tuesday. So students who have their 
heart set on seeing N.E.R.D and Girl 
Talk should hit up the wristband sta-
tion early, just in case. 

The Coachella-esque Bring Your 
Own Bottle campaign could pose 
another problem for parched con-
certgoers. Berg’s office is making a 
noble effort to go green and stay in 
line with the council’s recent plastic-
bottle-banning resolution, but this 
will demand that students do their 
part. 

Plan ahead and bring your own 
bottle — an empty one, yeah security 
will be checking — for free fill-ups, or 

be ready to pay $2 for some bottled 
hydration. But don’t worry; as a last 
resort the festival’s medical tents will 
have plenty of free water to go around 
if you find yourself feeling faint and 
without a canteen. 

While you’re planning ahead, 
keep in mind that the smartest kind 
of debauchery is best. So stay hydrat-
ed, and if you’re stopped by a cop be 
cooperative and calm — remember 
that once you’ve adequately identified 
yourself, you have the right to remain 
silent. When the clock strikes mid-
night and it comes time to relocate 
to the afterparty, shuttles will be run-
ning until 1 a.m. and A.S. Safe Ride is 
always an option.

Ultimately though, the Sun God 
Festival is about campus commu-
nity and collegiate camaraderie, not 
what’s planned for RIMAC Field. The 
Student Center will be just as bump-
ing if not more so, with a block 
party centered around KSDT Radio’s 
Shun God. I-House is just waiting 
to become a stretch of Euro-dance-

fueled mini parties. And the Koala’s 
annual Sun God Lawn Slip-N-Slide 
(plus a soap-foamed Price Center 
fountain, if administrators don’t put 
the kibosh on that tradition like they 
did last year) are reason enough to 
incorporate bathing gear into your 
dance costume. 

Get ready — it’s going to be epic.

Last week, a newly minted U.S. Senate subcommittee con-vened to hear expert testimony 
regarding a worrisome matter. No, 
it wasn’t about the economic crisis, 
swine flu or the war in Iraq, but 
on something in which many would 
argue our government should have 
no say: the future of journalism. 

The fledgling Communications, 
Technology and the Internet subcom-
mittee heard evidence from journalis-
tic entities such as David Simon (for-
mer Baltimore Sun reporter and pro-
ducer of “The Wire”), David Moroney 
(publisher and chief executive offi-
cer of the Dallas Morning News) and 
Arianna Huffington (co-founder 
and editor-in-chief of the Huffington 
Post) concerning the recent wholesale 
slaughter of newspaper staffers due to 
a dearth of advertising dollars, both 
online and in print.

At the moment, a central issue 
with journalism — which, by the 
way, arrived long before the glob-
al economy took a dive — is that 
newspapers, which once offered very 
lucrative advertising spaces, are now 
at the bottom of the list. As people 
turn to the Internet for information, 
the amount of available advertising 
money spreads more thinly by the 
day. 

Unfortunately, now that the 
Internet provides ways for advertis-
ers to push their product cheaply and 
effectively, there simply isn’t enough 
money supporting large news sites. 

This makes it difficult for previ-
ously profitable outlets to continue 
reporting at the level that was once 
possible. As reporters are handed 
pink slips and international bureaus 
fade silently away, we are in danger 
of existing without access to reliable 
information about the world around 
us.

I continue to read the reports of 
severe declines in advertising rev-
enue in the New York Times itself — 
because I trust its ethics, the quality 
of the writing, and because a news-
paper with such a stellar reputation 
should not have to bow down before 
the advertising gods as they sell their 
souls to snag an editorial mention. 

While the Times continues to 
report that it is losing money, readers 
are waiting for the paper to realize 
that this isn’t going to change. The 
rose-colored glasses need to come 
off — even when the economy turns 
around, advertisers still won’t be 
flinging dollar bills their way just 
because of the popular name. 

With sites about every topic on 
(and off) the planet, advertisers are 
no longer required to shell out the 
big bucks to put their name on a site 
— like the Times — simply because 
of its large readership. Instead of get-
ting thousands of views because of an 
expensive front-page ad, a company 
who wants you to buy skateboards 
can instead pay a number of home-
grown sites a pittance to display its 
ads.

The Internet doesn’t devalue the 
traditional brands, it just — in true

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

democratic fashion — lends cre-
dentials to every 14-year-old with 
dreams of designing her own boards 
by allowing her to set up a snazzy-
looking site for consumers to stumble 
across.

The important aspect isn’t that 
anybody and their pet cat can put up a 
Web site; the digital Holy Grail occurs 
when such a site develops a substan-
tial, devoted following and is snapped 
up by a recognizable brand name 
because of its content and readers. 

Take Jane Everywoman’s expert 
blog on do-it-yourself home renova-
tion, add it to a recognizable Web 
site run by an established brand such 
as Time Inc.’s Real Simple magazine, 
and you’re on your way to attracting 
that specific customer for whom ad 
executives are searching. 

But what does all this online mar-
keting blather have to do with hard-
hitting journalism? The answer lies 
in the hybrid model of news distribu-
tion that Huffington described dur-
ing the Senate hearing. Sites like the 
Huffington Post make use of bloggers, 
celebrities and household names to 
increase site traffic. 

But editors and reporters are 
absolutely essential to maintaining 
accurate journalism, and as fun as the 
Huffington Post’s Hollywood updates 
may be, someone still needs to report 
the hard-hitting facts.

While Times journalist Nicholas 
D. Kristof is known best for his 
unique global columns, he also holds 
an annual contest through the Times 
Web site where he selects an applicant 
to travel with him as he investigates 
his next piece. People didn’t apply for 
this contest because they think the 
Times corporation is the be-all and 
end-all of existence. They applied 
because they’re gung-ho about learn-
ing from such a knowledgeable fel-

low.
While it will be tougher for news 

writers to develop the same kind of 
following because of the necessarily 
objective nature of their chosen for-
mat, you bet that a reporter blogging 
from Afghanistan is going to get a 
serious number of people interested 
in his perspective. 

I’m not advocating the overthrow 
of the reporter by the masses of blog-
gers. Quite the opposite. As news 
organizations are finally forced — as 
I believe they should be — to loosen 
their grip on information gathering 
and distribution, they will have to 
recognize that alongside investiga-
tive journalists, other information 
can be distributed by talented writers 
through their sites without a compro-
mise in quality. 

Don’t lose the journalists; just 
make sure to also take advantage 
of other talent out there and use it 
to enhance the experience of visit-
ing a top-notch news site. Keep (or 
hire back) talented editors to ensure 
that content remains at the highest 
level while the online destination is 
customized to keep consumers both 
informed and interested. 

As Huffington stated during 
the hearing, it’s not about making 
newspapers work again. It’s about 
maintaining journalistic standards 
of integrity and accuracy, while still 
accepting the fact that information, 
and the power that comes with it, is 
no longer held solely in the fist of the 
publishing pooh-bahs of yesteryear. 

Unsurprisingly, the Senate meet-
ing concluded without any firm deci-
sions. Even so, the multitude of pos-
sible models left a feeling that while 
newspapers may be going, journalism 
— in all its iterations — is undoubt-
edly here to stay, even as it explores 
novel ways to connect with news 
consumers like you and me.

N.E.R.D 
Iron & Wine

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

& .E.R.D was on everyone’s Sun God radar through Fall and Winter Quarters — and this spring, for once, the rumors manned up and hit the 
lineup. That’s right: This time tomorrow, we’ll be froth-
ing and mothing toward a proud RIMAC spotlight 
on the great Pharrell Williams, international guru of 
making cute things 
cuter by cartooni-
fying them (A.S.’s 
baby Sun Gods, 
pictured on the 
right, fall creepily 
in line) and origi-
nal imagineer of 
making space for 
white-hot pace in 
the club beat. 

Less anticipated 
— to say the least 
— was this year’s choice for principal non-hip-hop act. 
Samuel Beam, grandfatherly singer-songwriter behind 
stage-name Iron and Wine, has lingered in the lower, 
slower tips of the nation ever since his South Carolina 
childhood — and it shows.

He’s like an escaped wisp of cirrus cloud, sort of 
curious to see about love but still bored, stopping for a 
second to look pee-colored in the California sunset but 
not really caring. In fact, it’d be a sturdy bet to wager 
he’s never been excited enough to make his beard move 
(aside from an emotional tickle in that moment when 
those notorious freckles aligned).

UNCAGE YOURSELF
By Edwin Gonzalez
Associate Hiatus Editor

! n case you can do with-out the swarms of punch-drunk classmates amassing 
at RIMAC Field, KSDT is offering a 
fiercely independent alternative. 

“zOMG it’s SHUN GOD” — the 
station’s first annual Sun God Festival 
supplement — is being hosted by the 
scene-savvy folks at UCSD’s own radio 
station from 11:45 a.m. until 6 p.m. Just south of the Sun God 
statue itself, the grassy knoll outside the KSDT studio (right next 
to Hi Thai) will be bustling with live bands, face-painting, skinny 
jeans, temporary tattoos and an all-day dance floor. 

 Think of it as Sun God’s backyard block party. 
“We wanted to present students with an alternative to Sun God 

that’s got different genres,” KSDT Programming Director Anna 
Huang said. “And [gives] more exposure [to] independent artists.”

While most were elated upon recognizing the big names pep-
pering this year’s official lineup, the organizers behind Shun God 
are ditching the hip-hop and mainstream rock monopoly for 
unsigned garage bands and local artists, each of whom will fill out a 
30-minute set. As a result, the performers won’t be seeing any pay-
checks from A.S. Concerts and Events. KSDT can rely on cost-free 
experimentals like Zsa Zsa Gabor and M&M Blues — and grad stu-

dents like the simply named Dylan — 
to win them a musical diversity badge. 

Caxton, the most Billboard-
friendly of the nine-piece line up, is a 
Palm Springs quartet that throws quite 
the Rilo Kiley silhouette. The band, 
which performed for the station’s last 
Fierce Friday Studio Session, will take 
the Shun God stage at 3:15 p.m. with 
a full, porcelain bawl more akin to 
Deborah Harry than Jenny Lewis. 

If a one-girl, three-guy indie act is 
still too same-old, then ATOMS might ring your bell. Performing 
at 5:30 p.m., the group’s got a Hot Snakes sound spliced with low-fi 
thrash and roots-rock beneath their lead’s scruffy squawk. 

Of course, if you want to take cover completely, the KSDT 
studio is doubling as a dance cabin. With deejays stacked for six 
one-hour shifts inside, Shun God’s willing to vie with any white 
tent Girl Talk can throw at them. (Situated in the Student Center, 
the folks at KSDT are well aware of Porter’s Pub’s key alcohol-
dispensing proximity. As a result, the staff on site will also be acting 
as security at the door.)

“With the old Student Center being so separated from Sun God 
and the whole RIMAC-ification of the party, we’re just trying to 
bring some change,” Huang said. 

The Che Cafe will also be hosting an $8 lineup of live bands 
after the Shun God event, at 7 p.m.

What’s Sun God When 
We Can’t Get Wet?

See HEADLINERS��page 10

, hings are getting awfully hip around here.The A.S. Sun God T-shirts are superim-posed onto pantless American Apparrel models 
(props for the pantlessness, flops for pulling a Clean Slate). 
Lady Dottie and the Diamonds just climbed from their 
Gaslamp dugout to come play Price Center. We, come Sun 
God, are going to be able to climb into art trees on RIMAC 
Field and attach munchie orders onto ziplines made to 
deliver our every craving to some philanthropic chef on the 

other end, who’s apparently taken up the cause of feeding 
fucked-up college kids.

Gary Ratcliff and Penny Rue have Facebook.
But somehow, amid all this awesomess, I have still found 

a reason to complain. Have you ever noticed how much 
things suck when they’re dry? The only element of Sun God 
that the administration is really resisting this year is water — 
god forbid we, and their precious lawns, get too wet. Garrett 
Berg and the team have given us Girl Talk, but the rest is up 
to you. Break out the super soakers. Find a loose screw in the 
fire hydrant. And a way into that goddamn fountain.

Even though the RIMAC assholes don’t want their 
muddy weed patch to get (gasp!) more muddy, and have not 
allowed for any sort of water sport in the main cage, there 
are hundreds of faucets on this campus. Just have faith, and 
follow the Sun God. I’ll see you there.

JOSEPH HO/GUARDIAN

Senior Staff Writer

� navan's noise, like their name, falls just short of sounding the same for-
ward and backward.

In fact, it’s is even better in reverse, 
jumbling all those painfully obnoxious 
love-note lyrics written specially for 
the band by a tortured fifth grader or 
brooding middle-school dropout.

Despite the scratchy, desperate 
screeches of lead vocalist and drummer 
Aaron Buckly (which his bandmates 
mimic on their instruments), Anavan 
does have one trick: keyboardist Molly 
Williams. When she takes the mic, 
they’re transformed from spazzcore 
leftovers to hard-candy pop — an 
unlikely relief. "The Perfect Sound," 
though far from perfect, is Anavan at 
their apex, so geniously built for doing 
the robot that any other form of dance 
doesn't even have room to occur. 

Anavan should normally be avoid-
ed, but this is Sun God, so join me 
under the bottle and next to the stage, 
dancing the meanest robot ever.

� omposed of pool-party crasher Pigeon John and his good pal Flynn, Rootbeer’s 
unhinged goofiness is caught some-
where between old-school Black Eyed 
Peas and cheap-shot hooks (when 
Fergie climbed on board). The duo’s 
2009 Pink Limousine EP is 20 minutes 
of straight whiplash, and its title track is 

predictably over the top with a repeti-
tive chorus turned whoopfest — less 
funk and more frolic. Likewise, the beat 
tries for unfussy and ends up toddlers 
with silverware, albeit nice and ’80s.

“So Good” finds Pigeon doing what 
he does best — speak-rapping school-
boy worship for a lady friend (“She’s 
the sunshine/ I’m the moonlight/ We 
need each other like a blanket on a 
cold night”). But then, a strangling 
hook squelches all the groove in one 
deflating grip: “Feels so good/ Feels so 
great/ Feels so wonderful to be with 
you.” Over and over again. Yeah — not 
feeling it.

Girl
Talk

By Reza Farazmand
Senior Staff Writer

� ragments of songs run rampant through a maze of looped guitar solos and displaced 
lyrics. Some are razor-thin, mutilated 
beyond recognition and gone before 
you know it. Others are long, drawn-
out and slow — like fat drops of sweat 
creeping down a hyphy club rat’s face, 
taking her makeup with it. A little 
Zeppelin here, a touch of Beyonce there, 
then “BOOTY, BOOTY, BOOTY” as 
Bubba Sparxxx kicks down the door 
and belts misogynistic come-ons to all 
the ladies in the house.

It’s directionless. It’s unexpected. 
It’s a little bit wrong. But goddamn 
if it doesn’t sound like pure magic. 
And that writhing orgy of provocative 
sound bytes, subtly mismatched bass 
lines and fleeting slivers of catchy-ass 
shit you swear you’ve heard before will 
envelop an isolated corner of campus 
this Friday when Girl Talk stages a 
manic coup d’etat on the 2009 Sun God 
Festival.

When listening to Girl Talk (aka 
Greg Gillis, biomedical engineering 
student turned dancehall messiah), it’s 
easy to forget that what you’re hearing 
is a mash-up. His tracks are unbe-
lievably fluid at times: Big-hair rock 
ballads frolic symbiotically with soul-
ful, gospel-inspired caterwauling, and 
the Pixies’ ethereal guitar riffs become 
a distorted car-stereo soundtrack for 
your midafternoon Compton drive-by. 
At other moments, it’s like listening to 
a scratched Huey Lewis vinyl played 
way too loudly over a broken barroom 
jukebox that skips unpredictably every 
few seconds, jumping violently from 
blues to hip-hop to grunge.

His creations are chaotic and defiant 
of any form, yet inexplicably melodi-
ous. There’s little time to stop and think 
about all the pieces — the subtle piano 
chords, the garbled moans, the rapid-
fire succession of signature Michael 
Jackson shrieks. With Girl Talk, there is 
only the sum of the parts, derived from 
hours of careful sampling, splicing and 
mixing, backed by a dual apprecia-
tion for sickeningly overplayed pop and 
little-known indie fare.

DJ Funk’s “Pump that Shit” melts 
seamlessly into the Cranberries’ 
“Dreams.” Elton John walks hand-in-
hand with the Notorious B.I.G. to the 
tune of “Tiny Dancer.” Then, without a 
trace of irony, Rick Springfield wails his 
love for “Jessie’s Girl” as Three 6 Mafia 
discuss a partiality toward oral sex. 

Girl Talk gives life to an army of 
fucked-up patchwork ragdolls, exposes 
them to a pile of radioactive bargain-
bin cassette tapes and then turns them 
loose in a bizarre, brightly lit city popu-
lated by washed-up one-hit wonders 
and chart-topping glam-rap superstars. 
It’s not quite rock, not quite rap and 
never quite coherent, but inarguably 
danceable as fuck. Just don’t call him 
a deejay.

! magine a dreary sonic storm descending on RIMAC Field, a cascade 
of eerie, thumping beats drenched in 
static. Behold Nosaj Thing, a producer 
from L.A. specializing in experimental 
electronica supposedly fused with hip-
hop — although the latter’s influence 
is all but buried beneath the rough, 
untamed exterior of computer-generat-
ed chaos. “1685 Bach” cloaks the faint-

est vestige of a danceable tune with a 
digital avalanche of ideas.

A veteran of L.A.’s underground 
deejay scene, Thing’s MySpace resume 
is heavy on the accolades and short 
on substance: His only commercially 
distributed comp is a five-song EP 
more than two years old, titled Views/
Octopus (the full-length version is 
slated for June). He’s the polar flip 
of dance-tent headliner GirlTalk, for-
saking any pretentions at pleasing the 
crowd in favor of showcasing mysti-
cal home cooking. Try to perk up for 
“Aquarium,” which revels in a skillful 
— if unfriendly — sample of whispered 
mutterings.

Nosaj Thing

� part from his overtouted spot in the now defunct Jurassic 5, there isn’t a lot 
of buzz on this bearded cat. Nu-Mark 
began spinning in L.A. as a teenager for 
small-time house parties, but it wasn’t 
until he hit Boston venue the Good Life 
that he met the Rebels of Rhythm and 
Unity Committee, along with crowd-
favorite Cut Chemist — thus birthing 

the West Coast’s beloved J5.
Nu-Mark went on two solo for-

ays in 2004: one collab with SoCal 
beatsmith Pomo, and one placid mix 
tape rife with smooth guitar, piano and 
Oriental woodwind — a tribute to the 
days of cozy vinyl that solidified him 
as the mild man’s alternative to Cut 
Chemist’s quirks. All we know since J5 
went AWOL in 2007 is that Nu-Mark 
has a full-fledged solo in the works 
— with savvy guests and a booming 
commercial release — and that you’d 
be apt to brush up on your J5 trivia by 
Friday to impress that mellow hip-hop 
head nodding sleepily to Nu-Mark’s set.

see the fame of playground pop-punk-

they stretched a little bit further and 

wrote that perfect song with the just the 
right balance of moog and cool to burn 
up the Billboard. Instead — like UCSD,

northern UCs — the quintet remains 
just out of MTV’s monolithic reach,

impressive Japanese fan base.

$ ong before the whimsical chords of “Boston” came to score YouTube how-to vid-
eos everywhere, Augustana debuted 
Midwest Skies and Sleepless Mondays.

Haven’t heard of it? No pressure: 
It plunked into obscurity without so 
much as a shaky wail from Dan Layus’s 
overplayed voice. 

So how did they end up wooing 
Epic? By moving to San Diego, of 
course, to soak up chillaxed rock like 
starved Midwestern loofahs and turn 
out All the Stars and Boulevards.

Augustana doesn’t look like a SoCal 
band: Their black pea coats over oxford 
button-ups reflect an autumn that San 
Diego never feels, let alone under-
stands. Moreover, the band tie-dyes 
their tunes with Americana appropri-
ate to their sprung-from-Springfield 
history: When Layus isn’t crying “You 
don’t know me, you don’t even care” in 
a boozy Orpheus voice, he’s mimicking 
Bob Dylan’s creepy old-man twang.

But googly eyed and love-riddled 
California tunes roll back in as conspic-
uously as tidal waves, and Augustana 
don’t hesitate to shake their new beach 
hair to the tick of the metronome.  

Don’t expect mosh pits to break out 
on the muddy RIMAC Field during 
Augustana’s warbly “Sweet and Low.” 
Instead, lay your dizzy head down and 
let their consuming piano-rock lull you 
to sleep. You’re probably going to need 
the nap for N.E.R.D, and who knows? 
Augustana (with the help of some 
obligatory additives) just might make 
for some unbeatable dreams.

% idterms got you down? Sneezing up a storm in Geisel? It’s 

time to scan iTunes and choose the best 
possible cure. Yeah — let’s talk chick-
rock. When all you need is a heavy 
dose of sunny sarcasm, fiery feminism, 
wedding-cake wishes and a taste of 
teen angst, look no further than Sara 
Bareilles — a sweet little brunette with 
an optimistic case of the love bug.

Born in Eureka, Calif. (just two 
hairs down from Oregon), the 29-year-
old UCLA grad got her start in a capel-
la groups and open mics. Soon, the 
coffeehouses got bigger and she was 
opening for Aqualung, Mika and her 
besties Maroon 5. Bareilles then signed 
with Epic for Little Voice, a solid 12 

pack with five even-better live tracks. 
With diamonds like “Many the Miles” 
— a folksy soul treasure that hits notes 
like liquid sunshine — and the vintage 
AA confessional “Love On the Rocks,” 
it’s easy to see what the label saw. 

Launching from a long tradition of 
independent women (Michelle Branch, 
Vanessa Carlton, Alanis Morissette, 
Fiona Apple, Ingrid Michaelson and, 
um, Beyonce), Bareille’s “Love Song” 
quickly spiked No. 1 on the U.S. Pop 
100 and stole two Grammy nods. Now, 
like a swine-flu antidote, she’s spread-
ing to San Diego. Watch out — happy 
happens.

Grand Ole

Party
By Allie Cuerdo
Associate Hiatus Editor

� ll hail GOP! No, not the Republicans — experi-mental punk trio Grand 
Ole Party is way too hip for starched 
shirts and elephant ties. Instead, expect 
a liberal riot of urban plaid and anar-
chist activism. (Like we didn’t see that 
coming.) Stereotypes abound on the 
college circuit, especially when every-
thing indie looks and sounds eerily 
alike. Take this strange fruit: A little-
known GOP scored a spot on the cur-
rent Yeah Yeah Yeahs tour. Awesome, 
except — one girl with pale skin, red 
lips, bowl-cut black hair and a Karen O 
wail, two backing male mates on guitar 
and bass — notice a pattern? They’re an 
exact copy of YYY, only less endowed 
with, you know, fans.

GOP’s only hope lies in Kirstin 
Gundred. The mini-Karen’s simulta-
neous singing/drumming is a show 
stealer for sore eyes: Timekeepers 
everywhere will be high-fiving percus-
sion’s return to center stage. Though 
she can’t swing the mic like it’s an 
acrobatic lover or dive into a sweaty pit 
on the guitar solo, Gundred’s ceaseless 
shout thrashes with the best of them. 
“Love, lust, nasty/ Habits make us who 
we are/ Love, lust nasty/ Habits take us 
very far/ Underground” trembles like a 
silkier, insane Gwen Stefani — circa No 
Doubt, of course.

Wait — I think there’s a name 
for this strange kind of human. Oh, 
right. A fucking downer. 

And a thousands-strong herd of 
horny nerds who’ve been cooped 
up in a dark room with lab chemi-
cals and laptops since September 
(FML) aren’t exactly equipped with 
the patience it takes to tolerate a 
downer. Each of the three whop-
ping studio albums and two rarity/
B-side/live snores that Beam’s got 
under his country buckle is piss full 
of happy-sad baby birdies too busy 
contemplating the sky to fly away.

“She says if I leave before you 
darling/ Don't you waste me in the 
ground/ I lay smiling like our sleep-
ing children/ One of us will die 
inside these arms,” he schmoozes 
on “Naked as We Came,” whose 

title seems Sun God-worthy enough 
until you realize it’s about tender, 
missionary love-making (need I 
quote 50 Cent here?).

We know the “real world” will 
suck, OK? Please, now, before my 
boner puddles into my party boots.

Indeed, all will be forgotten by 
nightfall. It’s actually creepy how 
cut out Williams and N.E.R.D-mates 
Chad Hugo and Shay Haley are for 
this job. Their clean chords and 
boy-next-door doodles aren’t much 
on paper, but helium into an exer-
cise in energy when put to the amp. 
All that, and with a Neanderthalic 
minimalism that scratches all our 
evolutionary hard-to-reach spots.

Williams is a serial lady killer, 
one side of a hipster grin raised 
under elevator eyes, somehow never 
making the girls feel violated even 

when comparing their asses to ride-
able spaceships — come on, he’s just 
here to please. Case in point, “Tape 
You,” from their dynamite debut: “I 
just want to see you come,” “Nah, 
baby, don’t worry about your make-
up,” “Now go kiss her boobs, and 
you kiss her boobs too.” Well put.

Hilarious fact: Turns out the 
N.E.R.D baby-face is more than a 
year older than grandfather willow 
in the 3 p.m. slot. Hmm ... must be 
something in the cartoon ice cream.

In any case, they’ve both got 
more grunt than Sean Kingston, 
who was somehow expected to 
bring 20,000 best-day-of-the-year 
hopefuls to climax on one (pretty 
hot) single alone. And, like T.I. the 
year before him (with “What You 
Know”) he didn’t even bother to fin-
ish singing the only song we knew.

Kills Me landed the critics, finally gar-
nering Soundtrack some much-needed 
props. Singles like the bass-powered 
“This Is for Real” blew the same wind-
in-hair bliss you get from driving your 
first car down the highway; “Fell in 
Love Without You” mimics the pert 
spirit of 2003’s “The Future Freaks Me 
Out” but thankfully steers from the for-
mer’s high-pitched bent while keeping 
squeaky-clean synth choruses intact. 
Though drawing from a history of 
worry-free bounce, the album reflected 
a more nuanced, versatile group — 
debted both to their newly grown-up 
sensibilities and a crowded guest list.

I asked bassist Matthew Taylor if 
there were any brawls in the Kills Me 
studio.

“Adam’s more of a pop guy, and Eli’s 
into the whole D.C. punk scene … so 
there was definitely an interesting mix 
of ideas,” Taylor said carefully. “But 
Ric didn’t want to do anything to [our 
sound]. ‘Even If It Kills Me’ used to be a 
15-second little ditty, and Ric extended 
it, put in a bridge and made it into a 
full-length track. So, yeah, it was a good 
experience all around.”

Now that they’ve re-tailored their 
skinny jeans to account for the years, 
the Minnesota natives are recruiting 
Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus for the stu-
dio, looking for a fresh release to propel 
them — once and for all — into the 
bedrooms of squealing preteens across 
the globe.

“It’s cool to work with a producer 
who’s been in your shoes,” Taylor said. 

“He’s like a big brother who has really 
good advice … He keeps it light in the 
studio. Sometimes you can take your-
self too seriously.”

But it’s hard to imagine that 
Soundtrack ever take anything too seri-
ously — even tongue-in-cheek lyrics 
on self-medication and pill popping 
are delivered with giddy enthusiasm on 
“Everything Is Alright.” Taylor insists 
that the dark irony is intentional.

“We’re just happy dudes … with 
some not-so-happy moments,” he said. 

Slowly but surely, the boys are 
breaking from short-lived commercial 
cameos and finding their place in the 
limelight. Nonetheless — like any one 
of us, procrastinating between seventh-
week breakdowns — they know how to 
have a good fucking time doing it.

check with No Doubt’s “Hella Good,” a 
funk revolution sounds pretty good. 

Confidence isn’t an issue for Theory 
— equipment is. When they arrived to 
Koncocshun, they were told there were 
no drum mics, no extension cords and 
that they would need to move their 
equipment off the stage afterward so 
the student orgs could dance.

With his right hand hidden from 
the bearer of bad news, drummer Sean 
Brust pulls the wanker.

They’ve got good reason to be con-
fident: Their self-titled release is a bona 
fide groove, with choruses aspiring to 
the freshness of idols the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers. Hip-swinging joints 
“Something to Say” and “Clean Cut” 
have plenty of attitude, and could eas-
ily be local-radio staples. Pulling out 
blistering solos whenever the rest of the 
band unchains him, Perl makes good 
on the band’s promise to follow in the 
footsteps of Jimi Hendrix.

Live, though, that confidence is 

a vice. Perl thrashes and tweaks like 
Scooby-Doo on meth instead of snacks, 
unloading so much energy through the 
speakers that the groove is easily lost. 
For his part, Cleary refuses to leave the 
spotlight, and spends the solos leaning 
on Perl’s shoulder like Axl and Slash.

But they have their moments: At 
Kuncocshun, their cover of the Peppers’ 
“Give It Away” drew everyone on the 
field, and when Cleary held the mic 
out to the crowd for the chorus, they 
yelled just as loud as if for the Peppers 
themselves.

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer 

On Tuesday afternoon, 12 Tritons were honored in an on-campus ceremony as part 
of National Student-Athlete Day. Two 
athletes were selected from each of the 
six colleges to receive recognition for 
their academic accomplishments while 
taking part in the often rigorous sched-
ule demanded by UCSD athletics.

“I’m always trying to figure out 
how they can do all these things in 
a 24-hour period,” said Director of 
Athletics Earl Edwards, who deliv-
ered the keynote comments at the 
event. “You look at practice sched-

ules, you look at studying, you look 
at community service and many 
of them have jobs as well. They’re 
not only doing it, but they’re doing 
it extremely well. That’s the most 
impressive thing; that they’re suc-
cessful at such a high level, manag-
ing a lot of different things.”

The honorees were accompanied 
by coaches and faculty members who 
made an impact on their respective 
careers. Each student athlete received a 
plaque for their accomplishments.

“I was very honored,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior Anne 
Schnecker said. Schnecker, a member 
of the fencing team, maintained a 3.9 
GPA while also helping the women’s 

fencing team to a conference champi-
onship in 2009. 

“It wasn’t an award I was trying to 
win or anything, but I always try hard 
at anything I undertake,” Schnecker 
said. “It meant a lot to me to get rec-
ognized.”

Sixth College junior Linda 
Rainwater, the current UCSD record-
holder and California Collegiate 
Athletic Association champion in the 
heptathlon and high jump, was also 
honored.

“It’s hard to balance having long 
practices during the day, and then 
you’re tired when you get home, 
but you still have to do homework,” 
Rainwater said. “It’s nice to get rec-

ognized for your efforts, especially at 
UCSD where we have so many good 
student athletes.”

In addition to Rainwater and 
Schnecker, honorees included Earl 
Warren College senior Kelvin Kim 
(men’s basketball); Warren College 
sophomore Jessica Ferguson (women’s 
swimming and diving); Thurgood 
Marshall College senior Leah Murphy 
(women’s track and field); Marshall 
College junior Vincent Nguyen 
(men’s tennis); John Muir College 
junior Nicole Saari (softball); Muir 
College junior Karam Badran (men’s 
crew); Revelle College senior Jessica 
McGovern (women’s soccer); Revelle 
College junior Tony Choi (men’s soc-

cer); Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Ian Bausback (men’s water polo) and 
Sixth College senior Bryan Dieffenbach 
(men’s track and field).

“What I’d like all the students, 
faculty and staff to recognize is the 
commitment that the student athletes 
make,” Edwards said. “It’s a commit-
ment to the athletic program, it’s a 
commitment to the university and it’s 
a commitment to themselves, being 
the best that they can be. Those are the 
types of individuals that we all want 
to go on and contribute to society as 
a whole.”

also convenes for an unofficial team 
bike ride — a 40-mile cycle through 
Encinitas and Rancho Santa Fe. 

With three sports to master, the 
focus of practices varies from one 
exercise to working on a combina-
tion of the three. Team members 
can often be seen swimming laps at 
Canyonview Pool or doing a track 
workout. 

During races, however, there is no 
time for rest between sports. First-time 
triathletes are often shocked at how 
hard it is to transition from biking to 
running, or how weak their muscles 
feel as they begin to run. The team pre-
pares for this with “bricks,” a workout 
where athletes use stationary bikes and 
alternate between biking and running. 

“Our success really comes from the 
passion behind it,” Kotturi said. “That 
passion leads to dedication and hard 
work, and that’s really key for us.”

Several of the members, including 
Uyeda, emphasized that the team is 
not just for elite athletes. The triath-
lon club is open to all UCSD students 

and does not make any cuts.
“The nice thing about being a club 

is that people can come in and put 
in as much time and effort as they 
want to,” he said. “If someone is just 
starting out, we can’t kill them with 
several workouts a week. They need 
to build a good base first.”

Brown echoed the sentiment that 
the sport is open to anyone who is 
willing to work for it. 

“The team welcomes every stu-
dent with open arms, regardless of 
athletic ability,” Brown said. “We 
encourage everyone to come out, and 
the only thing we expect is to show 
up on time and give 100 percent.” 

Many athletes compete in their 
first triathlon while on the team, 
including some top finishers. Most 
triathletes have a more extensive 
background in one of the sports; 
during that section of the race, they 
make up for time lost in other sec-
tions. 

Sophomore Reina Kawazoe, a 
first-year team member, joined the 
team looking for a new challenge 

after swimming competitively for 10 
years.

“I was so burnt from swimming, I 
needed something new and fresh,” she 
said. “Tri gave me a chance to explore 
how far my body was willing to go.”

Some of the team members com-
peted in other sports on the col-
legiate level. Unlike NCAA sports, 
there is no limit on years of eli-
gibility and, as a result, the team 
has several athletes that previously 
competed for the Tritons in swim-
ming and track. The triathlon club 
provides a way for them to keep 
competing for UCSD while continu-
ing their education.

While the team holds back-to-
back national champion titles on the 
women’s side, its members represent 
a vast range of skill and experience 
levels. Receiving little, if any, recog-
nition, the triathlon club is quietly 
progressing as one of UCSD’s most 
prominent teams.

PLAYOFF PREVIEW

It’s a now or never race. For the final regat-ta before the NCAA Division-II National Championships, the Tritons will head 
to Sacramento for the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships with their season on the line.

“It’s our last chance to prove to the com-
mittee that we deserve to go [to nationals] for 
the fifth year in a row,” senior co-captain Kelly 
Hansen said. “There is no more important of 
a race than this one. There are a lot of teams 
gunning for us since we’ve dominated in the 
past, but the end of the season is when we 
shine. That being said, the amount of pressure 
is definitely up there. But during a race, you 
can’t analyze your placement or look into the 
future. While we know we must perform well, 
stressing about it is only going to hinder our 
performance. We just have to go out there and 
row hard without thinking.”

Coming off a slightly disappointing third-
place finish at the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association Championship, women’s 
crew remains dedicated to its task at hand, 
approaching the regatta with confidence.

“WIRA didn’t go as we had hoped, but 
the past is the past,” senior co-captain Alissa 
Kispersky said. “We have since evaluated 
and changed our race strategy. Our team has 
to race a significantly faster time than we 
have done in the past … I know our team is 
entirely capable of racing at this level. We have 
done so in practice all year. All we have to do 
is apply that to a race scenario.”

The conference finals will take place at 
Lake Natoma at 8 a.m., and the Tritons are 
eagerly awaiting the occasion.

“I think each and every one of us has our 
own particular strength that we bring to the 
boat, and it’s definitely going to come out 
this weekend,” Hansen said. “The seniors 
especially will be bringing our determination, 
which includes our refusal to give up what 
we’ve built over the last four years. It’s going to 
be a regatta in which we truly see everyone’s 
heart and strength that this whole year has 
given us. I can’t wait.”

Many UCSD students played a sport in high school, often trying a hand at two or three. Now imagine compet-
ing in three sports at one time, each with its 
own nuances and techniques. Scattered among 
us are several UCSD triathletes who are not 
only capable of swimming, biking and run-
ning long distances without taking any rest in 
between — but who are also among the top 
collegiate triathletes in the country. 

The origins of the sport lie only a few miles 
south of campus: Mission Bay. With calm water, 
14 miles of running paths and San Diego’s ever-
sunny weather, it’s a favorite destination for 
endurance athletes nationwide. The pristine 
location gave these athletes a new trial ground. 
On Sept. 25, 1974, 46 participants competed in a 
600-yard swim, five-mile run and five-mile bike 
in an event organized by the San Diego Track 
Club. 

Several students interested in bringing the 
sport to the university founded 
the triathlon club team in 1998. 
Born from San Diego’s cycling, 
swimming and running com-
munities, the sport has found a  
home at UCSD. 

“People are learning we 
have a team on campus, and we 
welcome anyone to the team,” 
sophomore captain Sante 
Kotturi said. “We all really love 
tri and we want as many people 
as possible to share in that.” 

The sport has expanded tre-
mendously since its start, debuting in the 2000 
Olympic Games. UCSD’s team benefited from 
this exposure; it now has over 60 members, 
almost doubling in size over the last two years. 

UCSD competes in the West Coast 
Collegiate Triathlon Conference, which oper-
ates under USA Triathlon, the sport’s national 
governing body. Despite its popularity, tri-
athlon is not a NCAA-sanctioned sport, and 
very few colleges around the country fund 
their teams. Nevertheless, about 100 universi-
ties compete nationwide; many teams support 
themselves by organizing their own triathlon 
annually. UCSD holds an event called the 
Tritonman, which takes place at the same loca-
tion of the historic first triathlon in Mission 
Bay. 

“We get much, much less fund-
ing than NCAA teams do,” vice presi-
dent of the triathlon club Frank Uyeda said. 
“Typically, people put on triathlons both 
as a fundraiser and also as a competition.”
  Head coach Mac Brown emphasized the 
importance of student leadership on the team.

“I give the student athletes their workouts 
and basically act as a mentor,” he said. “I’m 

always available to help the athletes with their 
training, but most of the administrative stuff 
and organizing for races is done by the stu-
dents.”

The collegiate triathlon season culminates 
in the USA Triathlon Collegiate National 
Championships, which were held in Lubbock, 
Texas, this year. The race is a standard Olympic 
distance triathlon, consisting of a 1.5 kilome-
ter swim, 40 kilometer bike and 10 kilometer 
run. 

At this year’s event on April 18, the UCSD 
women placed four athletes in the top 25 to 
win a second consecutive national champion-
ship. The Tritons were led by graduate student 
Darlene Hunt, who placed fourth with a time of 
02:20:49.00, and senior Lauren Chiodini, who 
had the fastest split on the race’s bike section. 
The men’s team placed seventh overall, led by 
graduate student Tim Ray’s 22nd place finish. 

At nationals, UCSD scored 191 points, fin-
ishing fifth in the country 
out of 95 teams that com-
peted. 

During the Tritons’ short 
history, they have raised the 
competition, battling with 
the nation’s best squads 
every year. UCSD athletes 
have also accomplished 
great feats individually, with 
top charges qualifying for 
the prestigious Ironman 
World Championship in 
Hawaii. The Ironman is the 

triathlon to the extreme — athletes complete a 
2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and run a mara-
thon. The race can take up to 24 hours.  

Of course, results never come without hard 
work and practice, and triathletes do plenty of 
both. Despite being a club sport, the team trains 
and competes as much as any of UCSD’s sports 
teams. 

“The top tier of athletes who compete for us 
are working out at least once a day, sometimes 
twice a day,” Uyeda said. 

Brown, a local pro triathlete, was the sixth-
fastest American at Ironman Hawaii in 2007. 
This is his first year as head coach of the team; 
assistant coach Marcus Catano leads strength 
training for the athletes. 

“Our coach does everything he can to 
train us for our individual goals,” Kotturi said. 
“He reminds us to train smarter, not harder, 
in that more workouts are not always the best 
thing.”

The team meets for official practice Sunday 
through Thursday; the location varies accord-
ing to the activity. On Saturdays, the squad 

´We all really love tri and we want as many people as possible to share in that.”

WOMEN’S CREW By Brianna Lee Staff Writer

Following a walk-off victory over Sonoma State University in the con-ference championships last week, the 
Tritons look to carry momentum into the 
NCAA West Regional this weekend.

After claiming its second California 
Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament 
title, UCSD rose to No. 2 in the Division 
II national rankings and earned the No. 1 
seed for regionals. Today, the Tritons (36-12) 
will go up against fourth-seeded Cal State 
Dominguez Hills (34-21) in Keizer, Ore. 

“We can expect [Cal State Dominguez 
Hills] to come out ready to play,” junior short-
stop Vance Albitz said. “They’ve seen us, and 
we’ve seen them. It’s going to be a great battle.”

The Tritons and Toros have become famil-
iar foes after facing off several times in the 
past month, most recently in the CCAA 
Tournament. In mid-April, the teams split 
a four-game set before the first round of 
postseason play. UCSD held CSUDH to a 
single run, winning 2-1 to start the Tritons’ 
championship drive.

UCSD is looking to end the offen-
sive struggles suffered during its past few 
Thursday games.

“Offensively, we’re going to focus on our 
approach and stick with it,” Albitz said. “If we 
can do that, we’ll be successful this weekend.”

This year’s West Regional consists 
of CCAA rivals Sonoma State (32-14) 
and CSUDH, as well as Western Oregon 
University (33-12).

UCSD faced Sonoma State twice last 
weekend, crushing the Seawolves 16-1 in the 
first game and coming back to win an 8-7 
thriller in the championship. The two teams 
split six matchups this season, but UCSD won 
the last three.

The Tritons played Western Oregon in 
February, dropping three out of four games.
