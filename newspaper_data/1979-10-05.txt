Youth and State -in 
Growing Rift Doesn't Include College Students 

By Eric Jaye 
Hippies strum rock music on their guitars 

while communist party bosses still ban books. 
Unemployed young people wander the street 

with nothing to do. Some of them are forming 
gangs. 

Though most people support the !lovern-
ment, a few "cour~eous" young people risk 
arrest to distribute a few copies of an under-
ground magazine. 

Talk of democracy is in the air, but un-
married couples must still make love secretly -
often on the upper stories of apartment com-
plexes under construction. 

This is Chinese society today, according to 
UCS9 Chinese Studies Chairma n Paul Pick-
owicz:'mixed bag" of progressive elements and 
repressive policies existing side by side in a 
country moving halting toward liberalization. 

"There is a tendency in the west to think 
everything in China is free and wonderful-
... people don't realize there are a lot of prob-
lems," says Pickowicz, who spent most of this 
summer in China, including a stint with the 
Chancellor's delegation that concluded agree-
ment with several Chinese Universities. 

"People in China use the term democracy," 
says Pickowicz, "It's in fashion now. 

"There is no doubt in my mind that they want 
this ... that they support the government's policy 
of liberalization." But though the Chinese know 
they have "taken a lot of steps forward, they are 
still aware of how 'many stepa there are to go." 

Most of the discontent in Chinese society is 
concentrated among the young people - those 
born since the 1949 communist victory in the 
Chinese Civil War, says Pickowicz, who is 33 
and has been to China nine times since 1971. 

"The older people remember the miserable 
situation before the revolution. The contrast 
between the past and the present is enormous. 

"But increasingly (well over 50 percent of the 
population is under 30) you have a population 
that never lived in that society. 

"They (the young people) hear the older 

Clockwiee from -,apper right: a lITIall girl in 
the village of Wukung in the northern 
Chineee province of Hobeij Pickowicz outside 
a hall in Wukung (far Ieft)j cyclists on a street 
in Canton (pop. 2,500,000)j a girl at a desk 
in Wukung's high school. All photos were 
taken by Dr. Pickowicz in 1978 . 

. 

folks say 'I remember when 1 was a boy' and 
they say cOh boy, here we go again. 

"The don't want to hear that. It doesn't mean 
anything to them. 

"The young people, Pickowicz says, "have 
rising expectations." 

One of the greatest causes for discontent 
among Chinese youth is the youth unemploy-
ment problem, according to Pickowicz. 

"Every year tens of millions of high school 
graduates are dumped into the job market and 
the economy just can't handle them. 

"What you get is frustration and restlessness, 
even street gangs being formed, " because the 
young people ha~e nothing else to do , Picko-
wicz notes . 

" It's depressing, really depressing, for the 
young people, hanging around the house, being 
told , 'wait till next year, maybe there will be a 
job for you'. " 

The youth unemployment problem is com-
pounded by millions of young people returning 
to the city from the countryside where they were 
sent to work by Mao Tse-Tung. 

For most urban youth the idea of leaving the 
city is "like the kiss of death." The policy of 
Mao's government, which Pickowicz says would 
come along and tell many high school gradu-
ates, "you're going to the countryside, you're 
skills are needed there," was successful in solv-
ing the urban unemployment problem, but it 
was achieved at the cost of "tremendous 
unpopularity. " 

The new government has not only stopped 
sending routh to the countryside but has let 
many 0 those sent out under the previous 
government drift back to the city. 

"You have to understand the enormous 
difference between the city and the village," 
Pickowicz says. "It was ~ke going into exile for 
life. They didn't know much about the 
peasants ... they even had a hard time getting 
married. No one (in the village) wanted to 
marry a guy or a girl from the city."

Who's Responsible? 
People who preside over systems hide behind them. They 

avoid broad philosophical criticisms by telling you abaout flow 
charts of organizational structure. Sometimes it is a way to shift 
lhe blame to someone else; other times it is a way to pretend that 
no one 'is to blame becaUie the responsibility is diffused 
throughout the .organization. The broad philosophical statement 
is blamed on the critic's lack of understanQing the way things 
reall" work. 

I wrote a column Monday sayi~g the beer pub in the Student 
Center shouldn't have been opened. I said that society remains 
ambivalent toward the use of alcohol, allowing it to be available 
but at the same time enacting restrictions to limit its availability. 

Letter. to the Editor 

I said that people often drink too much because of societal 
pressures that make them feel unhappy and hopeless , and that 
the university is one place where people work to understand 
and perhaps eliminate problems that bring the pressure to bear. 
As a result, I wrote, I believed that the university is one 
institution that could afford not to be iimbivalent about alcohol, 
that it could recognize the enormous cost to society of its 
misuse and, if only for the sake 01 its image 01 itself , not allow it 
to be sold on campus. This altitude acknowledges that people 
who want to drink and are old enough can conveniently buy 
alcohol off campus. I also said that it was a shame that the 
UCSD student government could hypothetically profitlrom the 
misery that someone could cause after get~ing drunk at the pub. 
I realized that lois of people would think I was a modern-day 
Carrie Nation who intended to march into Walk 'lI Place and 
knock Walk over the head with a hardbound bible, but I decided 
it was a price I would have to pay. 

Scientists or Centerfolds? 
Editor: 

The Itatiaticl in the article 
"Sc:iencea Have ShortfaD of 

Women,'~. (Oct 2) are 
milleatling, ambiguoul'anddo 
not reReet rea~ty. The Daily 
Guard/an ltatea that the 
enl'lOllment 01 women ltu~nll 

.. ' .~ at UCSD. The problem 
.wi~ the Cwudion often,1ieI irl 
what it left out rather than in 
what it reported. The San 

Diello Union of Sept. 24 
reporil what woman 
outnumber men on all San 
Diego area campuses with the 
exception of UCSD and 
USIU, which are described as 
I'fairly staunch male 
strongholdl." Wllin the UC 

~.tem UCSD along with UC 
~rkeley hal the lowest female 
pQpldation. 

Further, The Daily 
Guardian'. article draWl no 

conclusions, pro or con, 
regarding the percentages of 
women on 'campus. I will 
alsume, however, that UCSD, 
in complying with federal law , 
is interested in equalizing 
female enrollment. This is not 
made clear in the article. 

Poetry Story Errs Slightly 

In addition, and to me more 
person~1y depressing , is The 
Daily Guardian 's abusive, 
sexist image of women 
portrayed in the Dos Equis 
centerfold. If we at UCSD 
want to equalize the number of 
women in the sciences, then 
our studenl publications 
should treat women with the 
respect due scientists rather 
than perpetuate a mindless 
"tils and ass" stereotype of 
Playboy or Oui vintage. 

Understandably CarlQs MOntalvo, AS president: talked to 
me about the column. He explained that the Student Center 
Board, not the AS, will receive a percentage of the pub's 
income. He said the Student Center Board, appointed in part 
by the AS, is basically autonomous from it except at budget 
time , and spends most of its money on the Student Center itself . 
The AS, he said , could in no direcl way profit from the pub, and 
therefore any mor~1 responsibility for the pub - not that Carlos 
was admitting it was a moral Question at a11- did not rest with 
the AS.

clarify two of my comments 
which were milconstrued in

concerns the age of our poetry 
seriea. The newspaper states 
that . it is the "oldest living

hope I said is that it is one of 
the oldest on the West Coast. 

The second and more 
important comment is one in 
which I am reported to have 
aaid that "Sex and race are 
unimport.ant" in the choice of 
~ts reading in the' aeries.

That Pub Commentary Was 
A Real Bummer, John 

Editor: the stairs, adjacent to the 
hump. 

And oh, what a journey. It 
was ... it was bright and 
insightful. UCSD felt quite a 
bit better than ever before and 
I was smiling big. What else 
was there to do except share 
my high with the guy in the 
right stall. He'd been around 
the student center lately. 

It turns out he was an editor 
or something and would share 
nothing of the kind. He 

P'eaae tum to poge 16 

That doesn' t change my point aI all. But what had a lso 
bothered Carlos was that I accused the AS of using beer to buy 
student support by holding beer parties last year and by 
opening the pub this year. He said the pub had been in the 
works for years , and that the Student Center Board, not the 
AS , is responsible for it. If there was a moral dilemma at a ll , 
Carlos was washing his ha nds of it. 

All that made sense to me for a while. But then I learned tha t 
the AS was a ngry about a Daily Guar(/ian editorial it thought 
sugges ted that the private party a t W alk 's Place Wednesday 
had been paid for by the AS. Wa lk, the manager, was pa ying 
for it , lhey complained . 

But we took a look at the invitations to the party. They were 
signed by Montalvo and Student Center Board chairman 
Gary Moser. They were taking credit lor it - the party, and the 
opening of the pub itself - but they were not paying for it. It 
didn't matter who was paying for it, however , because the 
attention was beinj;( focused on the student leaders. 

That is also why Carlos' point about where the money goes is 
academic. The AS has always wanted the pub, and the current 
leaders and the Student Center Board a re willirig to take credit 

for it despite the organizational realities. When they are 
criticized, they resort to lengthy explanations of where the 

money goes, who paid for the party, and so on. But the moral 
responsibility for the pub remains with the people who wanted it 
all along and the peop'1e who take tacit credit for it··along with 
the administrators who approved it. The systems they sil on top 
of cannot protect tht:m from that. 

Damn, I was the pub last 
Friday, psychologically 
experimenting with this dark-
light combination that the 
waitress turned me on to when 
bio-Iogics beckoned. It was 
lime. Having achieved a state 
of omniacient expansiveness, I

China Exchange 

The eight members of UCSD's 
delegation to the People 's Republic 
of China returned last week and 
announced that they had concluded 
exchange agreements with three 
universities there. 

The three, all technical universities 
located on the Yangtse River in 
middle China, will begin sending 
professors here next quarter, and 
some PRC students are already here. 

The agreements run for five years, 
and can be renewed after that if both 
sides think the arrangement IS 
working out well.

Chinese

Rebelling

The unemployed youth, (the

.qrant) have taken to letting 
their hair grow long and wear-
ing old doIhes.

He presence caused tremen· 
dous excitement." 

Pickowicz says he only man· 
ages to get his copy because 
he asked someone at the back 
of the crowd what the women 
had. When he was told it was 
Spring 01 Peking, he said he 
would like to have one. 

Someone shouted out, 'there 
is a foreigner back here who 
wants a copy' and the crowd 
just opened up and 1 went right 
up to the women and bought a 
copy .. . she only had six." 

It 's not that all young people 
in China are political agitators . 
Many, if not most, are apoliti-
cal, according to Picowicz. 

"The Chinae have learned 
the word Hippie and are Uling 
it," ..,. Pickowicz. Though 
It. laYS he feeb the· Chineae

in Canton, "When young peo.

8tOries.

"Sure enough," .. y. Pick-
owicz, "I went by and there

the "lang of four" (the «rOUP 
allied with Mao's wife which 
held power before and shortly· 
after hit death) the govern-
ment hal allowed much more 
freedom of speech, but some 
young people are pushing the 
government farther than it is 
willing to go, according to Pick-
owicz. 

He spent some time thi. · 
summer at "democracy wall" 
in Beijing and saw ju.t "how 
tense the situation can be." 

The people who gather in 
front of the wall, which i. fam-
ous for it's hightly critical wall

There is a fear that if t~e 

government policy changes and 
if there is a crackdown of lib· 
eral elementa, those who spoke 
out for more freedom of speech 
will be remembered. 

"But the young people go

"They are very courageous." 
All the press in China is offi· 
cially controlled. There is a 
great demand for underground 
publications, which are often 
ciIIributed at "Democracy Wall." 

Pickowicz tells of how · he 
obtained a copy of Spring of

The college students aren't 
completely content though, says 
Pickowicz. There is resentment 
against the Communist party 
structure inside the university. 

The party, says Pickowicz ,

Food CO-Op Doubles Size, 
Adds, Services, Speeds Up 

ipub Officially Open Today 
With Live Music, 25¢ Beer, 
Ribbon-Cutting, Champagne By Sam Gooch 

The UCSD Food Co·op is 
scheduled to open next week 
with many "exciting 
improvements" over last year, 
according to Co·op core 
member Ruth Rominger . 

The Co-op, located in the 
Student Center, has more than 
doubled the floor space over 
last year. Other improvements 
include a larger and more 
selective inventory, the 
capability of selling many 
items in requested amounts 
rather than in package~ 
quantities, a new dairy 
refrigeration system, an 
elec tronic scale and a cash 
register, both of which will 
substantially speed the 
service. 

Most of the new additions 

were made possible by a 
funding allocation of $2000 
from last year's Associated 
Students and a $3200 grant 
from the Student Center 
Board, Rominger said. 

"Because both allocations 
ultimately come from student 
regilltration fees," ROlTlinger 
said , "the Food C<>op plans to 
offer student discount rates . 
this year." 

"Since the Co-op is a non· 
profit organization, our 
philosophy is to provide as 
lTIany benefits as possible to 
the ca mpus community 
without going in the hole," 
Rominger said. 

"We have an ideological 
commitment to mold the Food 
Co·op into a viable business 

Internships Valuable 
Career Experience 

BI Joan Gartley 
UCSD students can seek 

job placements before 
graduation and practical 
ex perience through the 
Academic Internship Pro-
gram. 

This program places junior 
and senior students in off· 
campus work internships 
related to their major field of 
study. 

Students can earn 
anywhere from four to 16 units 
of credit through the 
internship, depending upon the 
num ber of hours spent 
working each week. The 
internships last roughly the 
length of a school quarter. 
Interested students must apply 
at least one quarter in 
advance. 

Marilyn Wilson, who heads 
the program , says the 
practical experience from an 
internship allows students to 
"find out ahead of time if they 
will be satisfied working with 
that particular job for the next 
forty years of their lives." 

The program was begun 
four years ago by Warren's 
Dean Gary Frost, who is 
currently on sabbatical. 

Frost was the head of a 
similar program at Michigan 
State University, where all 
studenta were required to serve 
as an intern for a minimum of 
16 units of credit. 

According to Frost, follow-
up studies that were done on 
students graduating from 
MSU with a baccalaureate 
degree showed a significantly 
higher employment rate than 
the national average. 

The degree of 'job 
satisfaction for MSU 
graduates was also higher 
because "students who have 
already worked in their field as 
interns prior to graduation 
have an edge over those 
students who must adjust to a 
job in a non-university setting 
for the first time," Frost says. 

Internships were originally 
offered only to Warren 
students, but are now 
available to all UCSD 
students . According to Frost, 
since there are no "applied 
programs" at UCSD, Warren 
will sponsor all programs that 
involve practical applications. 

Internships range from 
observing monkey behavior in 
the Virgin Islands to working 
in Washington, DC with 
various federal agencies. 

"Extra pair of hands" 
George Berris, assistant 

director of personnel at the V A 
Hospital, says the program 
"gives our hospital an extra 
pair of hands. The students are 
enthusiastic, supply us with 
brainpower, and add fresh 
insights to our re.search."

enterprise," said Rominger. 
" We want it to serve as a 
model for other student·run 
businesses. " 

The Food Co·op caters to 
vegetarians and other food 
consumers who want 
alternative food purchasing; 
the Co·op sells no edible 
products containing preserva-
tives or that have been treated 
with chemical fertilizers or 
pesticides. 

"The Co·op is structured so 
that all profits are returned 
directly to the organization," 
e xplained Rominger. The 
seven core members, who will 
act primarily in executive 
capacities, are not salaried but 
benefit by purchasing all Co-
op foods at wholesale rates. 
Volunteer workers also share 
the wholesale buying privilege. 
"We definitely need more 
volunteers," Rominger added. 

The Grand Opening for UCSD's fi'rst beer and wine facility 
will be .held this afternoon, featuring 25·cent beer and live 
music as part of its promotional effort. 

Chancellor William McElroy will officially open Walk's 
Place at the Pub in a ribbon cutting and champagne 
christening ceremony. The celebration will last from 5:30pm 
until I am. 

Music will be provided by "The Double Shuffle Band" and 
"Oh Ridge," and students at least 21 years old can purchase 
"beer for a quarter" with a current student ID. 

The pub has been in operation since Sept. 17, but is not yet 
"officially" open, says Gary Moser, student center board 
chairman. The past two weeks have given the pub a chance to 
test food, drinks and time schedules, he says. 

Some students may be turned away from the opening 
because of the expected crowd and the facility's inability to 
handle such a large number of customers, Walk Sellek, pub 
manager, says. . 

The pub is open from 11 am to 11 pm Monday through 
Thursday. and from 11 am to 1 am Friday lind Saturday 
It closes on Sundays. . 

In addition to providing a variety of beer and wine, the pub 
offers deli sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers and soft drink •. A 
salad bar will open sometime next week. The pub's patio is 
nearing completion.

Sol Le Witt Exhibit Recalls Influence 
Minimalist Engaged Mind 

Although the process of 
conception and realization of 
the original idea concern Le Witt 
more than what the work of art 
looks like upon completion, 
some of the pieces in the retro· 
spective possess a detached 
elegance and are beautiful , in 
an antiseptic sort of way. Wall 
Drawings B. and C. are the 
most interesting in this cate-
gory, resembling large pieces 
of finely woven cloth that seem 
to float on the wall. The wall 
drawings were drawn directly 

ees. "Modular Wall Piece With 
Cube," "WaD Structure, Black" 
and "Modular Cube" are the 
malt lucce .. ful of the ItruC· 
turt'!s,which tend to be monoto-

with a rude appearance and 
1962 written allover it (the 
year it wu made). Miac:eIIane· 
OUI drawin,l, prints and boob 
make up the remainder of the 
show and provide a good look 
at LeWitt'l ideal and proceas. 

By Melanie Neilson 
After a summer of renova-

tion the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art has reo 
opened with a retrospective of 
the works of Sol LeWitt. Con· 
sidered a pioneer in the Min·

born in Hartford, Conn. His 
work has been exhibited inter-

prehensive view of his work to 
be organized by an American 
mus«:um, The Museum of Mod· 

nous in their coldneaa and rig-
idity. The ugly ducklings of 
this exhibit are the two struc-
tur~, " Muybrid~~e I (A Still 
Movie)", and the "Wall Struc-

'I make the plans but on the museum walls by a team of eleven artists and incor· 
porate the architectural limits

is a peep show of sorts enclosed 
in a long black box (a sequence 
of black and w~ite photg~aphs

through a series of holes run-
ning along side the box, lead-
ing the viewer to an eventual 
confrontation with her navel.) 

One of the more coherent 
innovators attempting to tip 
the mind/eve balance in favor 
of the mind, Sol LeWitt has 
produced work that is ltunn· 
ingly beautiful. The look of hil

basic units for both his two·and 
three-dimensional works). 

Le Witt has had a profound 
inlluence on Conceptual and 
post· Conceptual artists of the 
70s as well as on writers , 
designers and musician.. He 
makes use of simple rule. and 
very basic elements to engage 
the mind rather than the eye of 
the viewer. The three primary 
colors, blue black, are uled in 
his drawings and like the struc-
tures are derived from the grid 
with four basic kinds of lines 
-horizontal, vertical and two 
diagonal •. In "Paragraphs on 
Conceptual Art" Le Witt says, 
"The ideas need not be com· 
plex. Most ideas that are aucesl· 
fuI are ludicrously simple ... Con-
ceptual art is only good when 
the idea is good." Some of his 
ideas are good and at least a 
third of the 60 pieces in the 

ern Art in New York. The 
exhibit presents the entire range ' 
of LeWitt's work. It includes 
sculptures of painted wood, 
steel, canvas and aluminum in 
various combinations with mod· 
u1ar and serial structures; framed 
drawingl; "bookworks;" and 
wall drawings. A 45·minute 
video-taped interview with 
Le Witt runs continually in which 
he informally discusses his work 
(the "commodity" he produ. 
ces); hill politics ("I'm trviml to 
subvert the system from with-
in ... "); and his role as an artist, 
(sees himself as a composer or 
architect; "I make the plana 
but I don't lay the brick .... "). 
Designed by Le Wilt, the catalog 
for the show is attractive and 
informative with three very good 
essays by Lippard, Rose and 
Rosenblum on his work as well

In ITime After Time' 

Will H.G. Wells 
Catch the Ripper? 

By Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Writer 

To place Time After Time in one specific genre would be an 
ambitious undertaking. The motion picture is comedy, fantasy 
romance, science fiction , and thriller and each of these elements 
is given equal focus and representation. The end result is an 
above average production that will hold people's attention, but 
won 't wow them. 

The year is 1893 and the setting a townhouse in Victorian 
London. A scientist has invited five of his closest colleagues over 
for dinner and the presentation of his latest invention. The guests 
listen and watch in disbelief as their host reveals that he has 
discovered the means for time travel and has constructed a 
machine for such purposes. This introduction to Time After 
Time sounds uncannily like an excerpt from the first chapter of 
The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, and in fact it is, with a 
notable difference: the would·be time traveller is the science 
fiction novelist himself. There is also a change in his time trip into 
the future . Instead of making peace between the Eloi and the 
Morlocks in the 31st Century, Wells ~oes to San Francisco, 
circa 1979, where his one· time friend, Doctor John Lesbe 
Stevenson, has gone before to continue his infamous career as 
Jack the Ripper. The importance of finding the criminal 
increases twofold when Amy Robbins, Wells' romantic interest, 
becomes the next victim. The story by Karl Alexander and 
Steve Hay'es isn't all that original, and the ending is predictable, 
but there are several twists to sidetrack viewers into thinking 
otherwise. 

MaIaIh McDDw •• H.G. W .... in T_ Alta- Tane' dim.,. into hi, time machine for. trip to 
.171 .. 8nd ........ Rippar. 

Malcolm McDowell has mellowed considerably since his days 
of sadism as Alex inA Clockwork Orange, and the transition is a 
welcome one. His double takes in reaction to the innovations 
made during the 86 years that have elapsed are characteristic of 
the Victorian charm that his role of H.G. Wells epitomizes. 
Mary Steenburgen could be named this year's Jill Clayburgh in 
the sense that she is a good new actress whose future career in 
motion pictures is promising. Her part of the independent And 
direct Amy Robbins is a nice foHow.up for her previous credit on 
Goin'South. David Warner's performances in Nightwing and 
Concorde: Airport '79 were miserable; in Time Aher Time he 
gets another chance and redeems himself by accurately 
capturing the sinister and enigmatic qualities of Jack the Ripper.

'The Onion Field' DocUDlents 
Policentan's View of Syste~ 

By Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Writer 

Joteph Wambeugh is a 
notorious stickler for details 
repreaentina "the real world," 
as seen through the eyes of a 
police officer. While those 
abilities were merely skimmed 
over by his television aeries, 
Police Storll and The Blue 
Knight, and practical/y non· 
existent in his cel/uloid 
novelizations, The New 
Centurions and The Choir· 
, they are definitely ingrained 
in The Onion tield. 

This latest Wambaugh 
effort il one of the few 
productions that adheres to the 
claim of being "a true story." 
10e title refers to a site in 
Bakersfield, where detectives 

Ian Campbell (Ted Danson) 
and Karl Hettinger (John 
Savage) are held hostage by 
former convicts Greg Powell 
(James Woods) and Jimmy 
Smith (Franklyn Saeles). 
Campbell is brutally murdered 
by Powell, but Hettinger 
escapes his partner's fate 
through the alii stance of a 
farm laborer. The film uses 
this tragedy as a foundation 
for the events which follow: the 

tims against criminals in 
reversed roles. 

The performances by Ted 
Danson, Franklyn Saeles, 
John Savage, and James 
Woods are flawless. Their 
characters are well developed 
to begin with, and increase in 
strength and concreteness as 
the movie progresses. More 
fine acting is provided in minor 
roles by Ronny Cox, Richard 
Herd, and David Huffman. 

He tries to cram too much 
(material) down the viewers'throats . 

Around Town 

subsequent arrests of Powell 
and Smith, the courtroom 
battles (which last a total of 
eight years and end with life 
sentences for Powell and 
Smith), and Hettinger's 
gradual mental breakdown. 

Wambaugh Roes into 
considerable detail document. 
ing the case on the lCI'een, just 
as he did in his book of the 
title. As a result he tries to 
cram too much material down 
the viewer's throats. Some 
incidenll, such as a Death 
Row convict's suicide attempt 
the night before his paaointed 
extermination, are totally 
irrelevent to the main story. 
Other scenes, such as the 
overtly tidy ending, are 
holdovers from Wambaugh's 
television days. However, for 
the most part, The Onion Field 
is a Rood psychological 

Harold Becker's direction of 
flashbacks to the original 
crime and trials, interwoven 
parallels in the lives of Powell, 
Smith and Hettinger, and 
updating the three characters' 
activities to the present with 
relative ease. Finally, the 
cinematography of Charles 
Rosher and the editing of John 
Wheeler serve to heighten the 
brooding mood and heavy· 
handed tone of The Onion 
Field.

Linda Blair .a Wonderfully Bad Actress 
By Mikel Toombt 

In characteristic fashion 
televi,ion has railed bad 
acting to the levd of an 
artform. The movement is of 
cour,n spearheaded by 
Charlie's Antlels which has 
... red a IUcceaaion of model 
acb'eaaes who were recruited 
without retard to ability, the 
tate.t (and perhaps worst) 
being Shelley Hack . 
Whatever their faultS, thou&h I 
the Angda lack a certain 
something, as Villqe Voice ' 
critic James Wolcott 
explained while tIi,cuaaing 
Heck: "She's too blankly 
innocuous '0 rise to Ihe heights 
01 true camp gha,tfineM -
Nd acting requires a brazen 
confidence she simply doesn't 
have (yet)." 

Lack of confidence has 
never been a pro for 
Linda Blair, whose ack of 

talent haa been showcased in a 
couple of spectacularly 
ludicrou s feature films 
(Exorcis' I and II , and possibly

made·for·TV movies, Blair is 
a wonderfully bad actreas, 
having gotten off to an awful 
earlv start (in 1973 at aae 14) 
and improved only slightly 
since. Her technique, which 
might be c1auified as ' 
QuasiNaturaliam, involves 
preaentirts herself as The Girl 
Next Door, an innocent 
horaeloving type (horses are a 
trademark for equeatrienne 
Blair), who stumbles into lOme 
bad lliek -she's possessed by 
the devil twice, she's been 
thrown into a juvenile 
detention home, lIhe'lI become 
an alcoholic, and 10 on. Blair's

supposedly portraying herself. 

Linda Blair has the featured 
role in the 1976 Sorah T: 
Portrail of A Teenage 
Alcoholic (rerun this Saturday 
night at 11:45 on C~nnel 2,) 
one of a seemingly endless 
series of telefilms with 
"Portrait" or " Diary" in their 
titles, most of which treat their 
subjects sensationally while 
attempting to maintain a cover 
of sociological seriousness. 
(The recent Portrai' of A 
Centerfold and Diary of A 
Teenage Hitchhiker are 
excellent examples of the 
genre, the latter with Dallas 's 
Charlene Tilton obviously 
emulating Blair.) Sarah T is in 
some ways similar to a 
previous Blair effort , the 
cont\lOversial and horrendous 
"expose" of reform schools, 
Bom Innocent , butthill movie 

at least keeps its cliches more 
or less under control. One 
strength of Sarah 'r lies in itl

----~-------------------------------------------

'Chapter Two' Not First Class 
ConIlnueJ from txJtIe 1 J 
after the death of his first wife. 
His brother Leo (Vincent 
Bagetta) sets George up with a 
series of unwanted and 
unsavory dates , until George 
meets Jennie (Barbara 
Anderson), a recently 
divorced actress and the 
second wife of his dreams. 
There follows a telephone 
courtship which has you 
SQuirming in your seat, and 
before the first act is over 
George and Jennie are 
married. 

David Hedison, while a 
national Itar, is not the actor I 
would have picked to play the 
slight, unassuming t;eorge. 
His dark hair, craggy face and 
brittle movements preclude the 
kind of breezy nervousness the 
George of ael one demands. 
His introductory scenes with 
Bagella are stiff, and the 
atmosphere only lightenl 
when Miss Anderson's 
beautiful Jennie enters the 
picture. 

Hediaon is much better 
suited to the George of act two, 
in which we find an almost 
.chizophrenic change of 
character al George and 
Jennie try to come to grips with 
their palt and present 
situationl. This George i. 
savagely cruel, stubborn and 
spiteful, and the new maniage 
aImo.t breaks up because of it. 
Here Simon is writing with (for 
him) dead seriousnelS, with an 
intensity I've never before seen 
in his work. 

To break up the grim 
second act proceedings, Leo 

and Jennie's best friend Faye 
(Jane A . Johnston) have an 
incompetent affair. Mis s 
Johnston is hilarious as the 
provincial-turnea.New York· 
er , whose timidity. and 
instinctive morals won t permit 
her to foUow the advice of the 
pop psychology paperbacks. 
and Bagella's Romeo sets off 
her clumsiness admirably . 

Maybe I'm prejudiced 
against Hedison, maybe I saw 
him deal, iron.jawed, with too 
many unspeakable sea 
monsters in Voyage to the 
Bottom 01 the Sea , but I think 
the best aeling was done by 
Miss Anderson, no stranger to 

the television screen herself. 
She plays Simon's Jennie with 
self ·assurance and class, 
handling smoothly a role with 
its own share of schizoid 
tendencies . 

Chapter Two is not a first· 
class Neil Simon play. It runs a 
touch long at two and a half 
hours. and it's spotty in plot. 
structure; much of the first ael 
is' filler, entirely superfluous to 
the mailer at hand. a series of 
standard gags that go 
nowhere, and I almost threw 
my program at the stage 
when, to resolve the conflict at 
the play's close, Simon returns 
to smoochy sappy shlock. 

'Time After Time' 
Conrlnaed from txJtIe J 2 

Nicolas Meyer directs reasonably well, considering this is his 
first effort. The special effects by Larry Fuentes and Jim Blount 
during the time trip sequence aren't .very impressive, and the 
time machine itself seems somewhat dated , but both are 
adequate. 

Time After Time is a complacent compromise between 
frivoloull fluff and seriOUllscenarios. It is currently playing at the 
Groasmont Cinema Theater.

The purpose of every Wang product is the same: 
to enhance productl"ity . 

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word proceSSing systems. 
But we're really not in the computer or word processing _business. 

Our business is productivity. And that's a people business. 

Because it's people who produce. Machines just make it easier. 
Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com· 
puter and word processing manufacturers forget that the end users of 
their products are people. 

At Wang, we never forget. 

That's why our products are simpler to use than theirs. And more 
efficient. 

And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business. 

nd that's why we're interested in Bachelor's, Master's or PhD 
"tndates. . 

• • UC I I 2 
.- Located in Lowe", Massachusetts, we offer excellent salaries and 

benefits including full relocation, profit sharing, stock purchase plan, 
medical and dental insurance, and full tuition reimbursement. 

In addition, we offer all the assets of New England - beautiful beaches, 
mountains, and forests; the historic, cultural, and educational richness 
of the Greater Boston area; and perhaps most important, an enviable 
standard of living within the reach of the software professional.
