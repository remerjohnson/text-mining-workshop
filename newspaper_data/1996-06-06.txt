Conjoined 1\vins Move a Step Closer to 
Separation With Skin-Stretching Implants 
BABIES: Moreno twins are in 
good condition and will be 
separated within weeks 
By Karen Strong 
Guardian Reporter 

The Moreno twins, one of several sets of con-
joined twins to be born in recent months, under-
went urgery yesterday in preparation for their 
urgical separation at the UCSD Medical Center 

(UCSDMC), scheduled to occur in about two 
weeks. 

Surgeons implanted tissue expanders in Jever 
Aron and Roman Alan Moreno, born on May 16, 
in order to stretch the skin urrounding the area 

where the twins are joined. This initial urgery 
will provide additional skin to cover areas left 
exposed after the separation. 

'The first procedure to insert the expanders 
went smoothly," UCSDMC spokesman Nancy 
Stringer said. "Right now they are resting in the 
Infant Special Care Unit." 

The expanders, balloon-like devices placed 
under the kin, are expected to provide the neces-
ary amount of skin in two to three weeks. If no 

complications develop, the separation surgery wi II 
take place immediately afterward ,

Group Suggests 
Ways to Achieve 
High Quality of 
Education 
REPORT: Higher Education 
Policy Center says students 
and schools must cooperate 
ByM ..... Pal 
Staff Writer 

With enrollment at California public uni-
versities and colleges projectcd to increa -e 
by a staggering half-million students during 
the next decade, the California Higher Edu-
cation Policy Center relea ed a study last 
week outlining ways to help maintain 
California's educational quality. 

The study, entitled "Shared Responsibil -
ity: A Plan for Preserving Educational Op-
portunity and Quality in the Next Decade," 
warned that public colleges and univer ities 
and students must work together to preserve 
California' s current standards in higheredu-
cation. 

" It will take an extraordinary effort by all 
stakeholders - the public, political leaders, 
education officials, the college and the stu-
dents - if California's long-standing com-
mitment to educational opportunity is to be 
continued," said Joni Finney, the associate 
director of the non-profit , San Jose-based 
center. 

Among other things, the report recom-
mends fee increases and greater control of 
future on-campus construction to accom-
modate the expected innux of students. 

"We cannot sacrifice quality or opportu-
nity [011 education ... We must contribute to 
the reduction of costs," Finney said. 

Assem~ywoman Denise Moreno 
Ducheny, author of ACA 44 - a fee-freeze 
bill that recently passed the state Assembly 
- said that she fears fee increases discour-
age students from pursuing higher educa-
tion. 

"Fee increases should be tied to 
affordability rather than to the whims of the 
state budget," Ducheny said. "The center' 
suggestion that fees should rise gradually 
and predictably reneets the principles built 
into A A 44." 

The study ays that if the center's recom-
mendations are implemented, expenditures 
needed to sustain the 2.2 milli n student in 
California's univer 'itics and college will be 
reduced to about $2 billion, which th stat"

After nearly 20 man-years of

stated in a June 3 press release. 

Loomis and Kuspa had previ-
ously used a mapping technique 
they dubbed "restriction enzyme-
mediated integration (REMI)"to 
construct the map of 
Dictyostelium. 

More recently, Loomis and 
Kuspa used a mapping strategy 
that utilized artificial yeast chro-
mosomes, simplifying their work 
greatly and making it easier to 
determine the sequence of nucle-
otides - the building blocks that 
make up DNA.

reinforced their earlier work and 
helped eliminate any possibility

Loomis and Kuspa hope their re-
search will shed light on the pro-

Loomis said that this genetic 
mapping will not explain how a 
baby forms from a fertilized egg. 

"It sure will help as we con-
tinue to try to understand the 
amazingly subtle and complicated 
processes that go on during em-
bryogenesis," he said. 

The S I million study was 
funded by the Human Genome 
Project, the Searle Scholarsffhe 
Chicago Community Trust and the 
American Cancer Society. 

The m"p of the amoeba was 
published in the current issue of 
Proceedings of the National Acad· 
emy of Sciences . 

Loomis plans to sequence the 
genes next, a project expected to 
cost $10 million. 

"It would be nice to know how 
many pieces of the puzzle there 
are," Loomis said. "When we ha ve 
the genome sequencing com-
pleted, we'll know this."

A~S. Council Amends Voting Bylaws 
MEmNG: Unions 
encourage greater 
student 'participation 
By Laura Lamb 
Staff Writer 

[n its final meeting of the quarter, 
the A .S. Council last night addressed 
the concerns of both union members 
and Elections Manager Jay Park en 
route to closing out its busi ness forthe 
year. 

Union members Hank Jennings, 
JelgerKalmijn, Thea Chang, and Tom 
Williams presented their opposition 
to the UC Regents' current handling 
of UCSD Medical Center issues. 

The union members said both 
management's decision to lay offhos-
pital employees and its attempts at 
privatization occurred without ad-
equate input from employees, stu-
dents and the community . 

Kalmijn said administrators gave 
employee interests lillie recognition , 
forcing certain departments to either 
accept pay and benefit cuts, or have 
their jobs contracted out. 

"[Employees had al gun put to 
their head by the regents," Kalmijn 

said. "We have to be pan of the pro-
cess." 

The union representatives also 
urged students to consider supporting 
altemati ves to pri vati zation. 

"We want to distribute health care 
more equally," Jennings said. 

Fonner A.S. President Naomi Falk 
supported the union members' efforts 
and presented her opinions concern-
ing health care and the lack of student 
awareness of the problems. 

"It's incredibly important that we 
continue to educate people," Falk said. 

Kalmijn agreed that students 
should actively support the unions to 
procect their own interests. He said 
students should be concerned that the 
majority of their parents contribute 
tax dollars to state facilities like the 
UCSD Medical Center. 

Kalmijn also said students should 
be aware of a potential decrease in the 
quality of health care because over-
worked ho pital employees may not 
provide adequate service. 

"This isn't a laborthing," Kalmijn 
said. "It's a health care issue." 

The union members invited the 
council 10 attend their weekly meet-
ing on Saturdays. 

[n other news, Elections Manager 
.Jay Park presented several amend-

ments to the Election Bylaws. 
Disagreement arose over Park's 

amendments, which would give the 
elections manager"fuIJ authority over 
the elections," would remove the 
council's ability to reject elections-
commiuee members chosen by the 
manager and would dismiss the previ-
ous authority of the Judicial Board to 
challenge certain policies. 

Commissioner of Operations/Ser· 
vices and Enterprises Erin Holve ex-
pressedherconcern regarding the pro-
posed consolidation of authority, 
which would remove the council as a 
check and balance to the manager. 

"[Thatltheelections manager is in 
100% control is scary," Holve said. 

Muir Senior Senator Justin Farar 
disagreed with Holve, citing the cxist-
ence of an elections commillee with 
representatives from each college to 
provide a check to the manager. 

"I [alsoJ just don't really see the 
election manager going on a power 
trip," Farar said. 

After further discussion, the A.S. 
pas ed the amendments with 10 votes 
in favor and eight abstention .

MUIR STUDENT ATTACKS JUDICIAL PROCESS 
Editor: 

I am sure that most Muir resi-
dents have, at some time, dealt 
with the so-called "fair" discipli-
nary procedure of Muir Residential 
Life, whether it was for being 
caught with a keg, being drunk in 
public, or, in my case, simply hav-
ing an empty beer can next to my 
trash. 

In case you arc not aware of the 
article printed in the Guardian 
("Muir Student Appeals Case to 
Judicial Board," April IS, 1996), 
this, in the opinion of Muir 
Res idential Life and the Muir 
Judicial Board. was enough to pun-
ish me with three hours of commu-
nity servi(;e, an al(;ohol dass, a~ 
well as probation.

findings of both of the Residential 
Life-controlled processes. After 
being granted an appeal, the Muir 
College Council agreed that we 
were disciplined without cause. 
They found the university lacked 
evidence, and they acquitted us on 
all charges. 

This is one of the many clear 
cases of Muir Residential Life' 
refusing to grant a fair trial to its 
own students. This is because Muir

pus that is allowed to create and

in our footsteps: Call the ~tudent

Until the current system is 
replaced or discontinued, thi, is the 
path that students at Muir will be 
forced to take in order to seek JU~ 
tice. It is the lirst and most impor-

Sheddon added that severa l 
former SDSC employees shared re-

Sheddon named Karin in particu-

Deputy Director Wayne Pfeiffer and 
former ManagerofInformation Ser-

whom are currently employed at

"Dennis helped solve the prob-
lems by discussing issues," 
Sheddon said. "He went to lots of

With both UCSD and GA col-
laborating on the proposal , SDSC

- is considered by many in the 
UCSD community to be a prime 
contender for PAC!. 

Duke confirmed rumors that 
only two or three supercomputer 
centers will be considered for the 
new NSF program. 

"With a unified proposal , we 
have an excellent chance - al-
though it 's not a slam dunk by any 
mean ," Duke said. 

Duke added that compared to 
the stormy weather SDSC has en-
dured in the past months , the 
center's future looks bright. 

"I think the attitude is much bet-
ter," he said. "People ... arc glad that 
the two sides gotlOgether and hope

UCSD Study Shows Homework 
Improves Math Test Scores 
RESEARCH: Julian Betts' 
results could apply to other 
school subjects 
By Brian Neal 
Guardian Reporter 

Student have long questioned the educa-
tional benefit of doing homework , often con-
sidering it a waste of time. However, a study 
rece ntl y completed by 
UC D Assistant Professor 
of Economics lui ian R. 
Betts confirms lhat students 
can gain in the long run 
from a small amount of 
regular homework in math-

dardized tests taken every fall by students at 
52 urban, suburban and rural middle and high 
schools. 

The LSA Y also includes detailed surveys 
completed twice each year by parents, princi-
pals and math and science teachers. 

The surveys supplied Betts with a variety of 
information, including the amount of home-
work assigned per night , clas size, the teach-
ers' experience in the classroom, the level of 

education of both teachers 
and parents, students' SOCIO-
economic status as well as 
the rolc of homework in the 
students' classes.

dardized math tests two years 
ahead of their current grade levels." 

According to Bells, the benefits of doing 
homework apply to students of all abilities. 

"By assigning more homework, teachers 
could improve all students' test scores," Bells 
said. '''A' students benefit as much as 'D' stu-
dents." 

The report is the result of a university-funded 
statistical analysis ofthe performances of nearly 
6,000 seventh and 10th graders taking math and 
science standardized tests. 

Betts extrapolated information for his study 
from the Longitudinal Study of American 
Youth (LSA Y), a random sampling.of stan-

tween math test scores and success in the job 
market. 

According to Betts, an extra hour a night 
spent on math homework translates into a $6-7 
increase in hourly wages over a worker's life-
time. 

He further claims that his results carry over 
from mathematics into other fields . 

"Although I focused on math performance, 
it' s reasonable to assume that more home study 
in other subjects will have a beneficial effect on 
learning without adding much to teacher 
workload or increasing education spending," 
Betts said.

Accor~ing to Stringer, this type 
of surgery is rare and doctors will 
not have a complete picture of the 
twins' condition until they can ex-
amine the babies on the operating 
table. 

Medical-center administrators 
have not estimatsed the total cost of 
caring for the infants. According to 
UCSDMC Medical Director Paul 
Jagger, a similar surgery at the San 
Diego Chi Idren' s Hospital cost 
$180,000. 

Although the twins, born at 
Sen pps Memon al Ho~pltal in Chu la

are residents of Tijuana.

According to UCSDMC Acting

10 SPORTS 

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-Up 
Cycling 
Sixty team, 165 men, 90 

women ... and one championship. 
This was the scenario for the 

National Collegiate Cycling Cham-(I) pionships held in the rolling terrain and siz-zling summer tem-
peratures of San Luis 

Obispo last weekend. 
UCSD hoped to contend for the 

national championship with the help 
of a deep men's team and first-year 
sensation Katrina Berger leading the 
women's pack. However, an imper-
fect perfonnance caused UCSD to 
fall behind the top squad for an 
overall fourth place finish. 

'The 13-mile team triallook place 
on Saturday. Despite a great start, 
Tim Knudsen was forced to drop 
out early in the third mile. Ryan 
Cady, Ijln Belliger and Adam 
Livingstoncontinued,butcouldonly 
manage a 10th place finish. 

In the women's competition, 
KatrinaBergerpulJed forward early , 
and together with teammates Kelly 
Stock, Briltney Ga.~sert and Kristine 
Schwinof, managed to take fifth . 

If the team trial challenged 
UCSD, then the road race later that 
day was thetestofa lifetime. Prom-
ising 90 miles of hell for the men 
and 60 for the women, the course 

was even more brutal than adver-
tised due to a heat wave plaguing the 
area. 

Livingston, who placed second 
last year, was unable to repeat his 
performance and was forced to settle 
for 15th place, followed by Knudsen 
in 25th place. 

For the women, Berger tried to 
live up to her pace-setting reputa-
tion, leading the front breakaway 
group of six into the first hill. She 
was unable to maintain the lead, 
however, and succumbed to the heat 
at mile30,ending her race. Schwinof 
finished in the 31 st spot. 

The weekend's final event was 
the Criterium on Sunday . The 
women were the first to challenge 
the 1000meter hill, where Berger 
took eighth place. Her strong finish 
allowed UCSD to surpass UC Ber-
keley in the standings, and trail Ari-
zona State by a mere four points. 

The men felt they would be able 
to easily close the gap on ASU as 
UCSD was the only team to keep all 
four riders in the lead group after the 
preliminary cut. In the end, how-
ever, with Knudsen dropping out 
afteranintensebreakaway,Bettinger 
placed ninth and Cady, 17th,andleft 
the team in fourth place behind ASU.

was like a movie," Parker said. "Ev-
erything was in slow motion. I re-
member making my last tum and see-
ing her and thinking, 'Just one more 
lap, come on .... 

But Ainsworth was swimming like 
a woman possessed. She came from 
behind and out-touched Parker at the 
wall. 

"Coming in second was the best 
thing that cou ld've happened to me," 
Parker said. '1 trained really hard all 
summer and I came back determined 
to ha ve a great senior year." 

But at the outset of her final sea-
son, Parker sprained her back. It was 
an injury that would plague her forthe 
entire year, despite frequent trips to 
the offices of chiropractors, doctors 
and trai ners. 

In an attempt to ease the pain, 
Boyd and Parker decided that she 
should work on her freestyle ev~nts, 
moving away from her specialty, the 
backstroke. Parker quickly learned to 
excel in these events as well, breaking 
the school records in both the 100 and 
200 freestyle races. 

When the NCAAs arrived, she was 
aiming for a 200 free title. For the 
benefit of the team, Parker also com-
peted in the 100 backstroke. The 
double proved too much as Parker 
was unable to corne away with the

elusive title. Then came the day's 
final event, the 800 freestyle relay. 

'That was the last race I thought 
about winning," . 
Parker remembered. 
'Then the first two 
legs went off and I 
was like, 'Oh my 
God, we have a 
chance.' My 
grandma and my par-
ents were in the 
stands and I just 
knew il was time." 

Boyd was eager 
to see Parker retire 
with a title. '''There is 
no one who has come 
through this program 
that deserved a title 
more," he said. 

So, while Parker 
was running between 
rub-downs and 
award ceremonies, 
Boyd pulled aside 
her teammates , 
Heather McPherson, 
Jenny Irwin and 
Kelly Byme.

'The trio responded, swimming "out 
of their minds"to spot Parker a three-
second cushion. She had no trouble 

finishing the deal. 
" It was very 

gratifying for me to 
see her get a title 
after all her hard 
work," Boyd said. 
"As a coach, you 
never want to play 
favorites, but it's 
hard nollo with her. 
She does everything 
you want her to in 
the pool and out.

you could look at all

and go, 'Who'sCar-

was, in a way, the

has given to this 
team the last four 
years has been a big 
partin molding what 
we have now."

Concert festivals Lollapalooza, H.O.R.D.E. 

and ENIT battle for commercial success 
Local theaters offer an 

alternative to summer films 
By Either Yoon 
Hiatus Editor 

If anything, summer 1996 
looks to top any earlier attempts as 
the season of commercial "alter-
native" concert lOUrs. 

This summer's most 
hyped contenders 
Lollapalooza, the 
H.O.R.D.E. festival and 
ENIT (Perry Farrell 's 
post-Lollapalooza pro-
ject) - are each expect-
ing to draw thousand of 
on-lookers and bring in 
ticket revenue in excess of $10 
million. 
LoIIapaIooza 

Coming to Los Angeles some-
time in August, thi s year's Lolla-
palooza tour departs from the fes-
tival 's traditional line-up of alter-
native heavyweights in favor of a 
harder sound. 

Lead by metal rockers MetaIli -
ca and Soundgarden, as well as 
punk bands Rancid, the Ramones 
and Shaolin Monks, the heavier 
sound of Lollapalooza's main 
stage will be countered by a side 
stage featuring a more alternative 
line-up - including Soul Cough-
ing, Sponge, the Melvins, Satchel, 
Jonny Polonsky and Fireside on 
the tour 's West Coast dates. 

Lollapalooza will also feature 
a third stage, that includes the San 

Diego-based band Chune and 
Lutefisk on the first leg of the 
tour, and Varnaline and thirty-
ought-six at the end of the tour. 
H.O.R.D.E. 

H.O.R.D.E., the 
brainchild of Blues 
Traveler front man 
John Popper, will offer 
a "hippier" sound than 
Lollapalooza's "alter-
nalive." 

Performers con-
firmed for the expand-
ing H.O.R.D.E. line-up 

include mellow pop-rock per-
formers Blues Traveler, The Dave 
Matthews Band, Lenny Kravitz, 
Rusted Root, and on alternate 
dates, Natalie Merchant. 

The H.O.R.D.E. festival comes 
to the Blockbuster Pavilion in San 
Bernardino on July 26 and 27. 
ENIT 

The ENIT tour will ki ck off in 
September led by Farrell 's band 
Porno for Pyros, which just 
released its critically acclaimed 
second album Good God's Urge. 

Also slated for the ENIT line· 
up is the recently resurrected '80s 
dark -pop rock band Love and 
Rockets, which just released its 
comeback album Sweet F.A . 

In addition to being featured on 
the new Porno for Pyros album, 
Love and Rockets also played the 

over-hyped "Future World" rave 
at the San Diego Civic Center in 
April. 
Local Conc:erU 

A performance by Ray Charles 
kicked off the Humphrey's Con-
certs by the Bay ummer series 
last night. 

Running through September, 
this summer's series boasts a stel-
lar line-up of contemporary jazz 
and blues artist, including Al Jar-
reau, who performs tonight. 

Also scheduled to perform are 
the Brian Setzer Orchestra (June 
13), David Sanborn (June 20), 
Spyro Oyra (July 5), Sergio 
Mendes (August 4) and Tom 
Jones (September 3). 

The BUllhole Surfers will play 
songs off its newly released album 
Electriclarryland, along with The 
Toadies, Reverend Horton Heat 
and the Supersuckers on June 29 
at San Diego State's Open Air 
Theater. 

The Vans Warped Tour, which 
comes to the San Diego Sports 
Arena on July 5, will feature an 
array of punk and ska bands, 
including NOFX, Penny wise, The 
Dance Hall Crashers, nwri tten 
Law, Fishbone, blink-182, ClV, 
the Deftones, Red Five, The Sui-
cide Machines, Rocket From the

Is your band influenced by

Yeah. We played at the Soul

Dragonheart 
Film salvaged by special 
effects and shoddy humor 

By Dan Sweeney 
Senior Staff Writer 

When Universal Pictures sel 
out to make "Dragon heart," they 
had no illusions about what would 
make the film success-
ful. They would infuse it 
with the requisite sword 
and sorcery fare -
namely a noble hero 
(Denni s Quaid), a das-
tardly villain, a gorgeous 
damsel in distress and 
heaps of epic battles 
replete with slashing 
blades and clanking armor. 

However, the ultimate fate of 
the film would rest on Draco, the 
computer-animated dragon, the 
voice of Sean Connery. 

To that end, the filmmakers did 
not want something like an original 
plot to detract from the stunning 
visuals. The result is a formulaic

film, relying heavi ly on the action 
and incredible graphics to carry the 
story. 

Many a film has crumbled 
under such circumstances. "Drag-

onheart ," on the other 
hand, works for one sim-
ple reason - Draco 
makes thi s IiIm. 

In a nutshell, the 
story revolves around 
Bowen the dragons layer 
(Quaid), who allies with 
Draco to rid the country 
of the tyrannical King 

Einon, Bowen' s former pupil. 
Along the way, the duo hook up 

with Kara (Dina Meyer of 90210 
fame), a beautiful peasant girl who 
would seem to be Bowen's logical 
romantic interest. 

As it ends up, their relationship 
never materializes. We do get to 
see her kick the crap out of some

bad guys, though. 
Ultimately, the film is reduced 

to an epic battle between Einon's 
army of well-trained knights, and 
Draco and Bowen's gaggle of cow-
ardly, awkward peasants. You can 
guess how that ends up. 

Through it all sits Draco, the 
queen mother of all special effects. 
Studio execs poured $27 million -

over half of the film 's budget -
into making Draco a reality. The 
end result makes "Jurassic Park" 
look like a home video in compari -

The only flaw with Draco i not 
his appearance, surprisingly, but 
his voice.

Best Bet 

The undisputed "best bel" of the 
upcoming summer concert season 
(or any concert sea on) is the 
weekend-long Tibetan Aid 
fundraiser in San Frandsco. 

The concert, which is sponsored 
and organized by the Beastie Boys' 
MILA Repa fund, will round up a 
choice sampling of music's finest 
on June 15 and 16 at Golden Gate 
Park, between noon and 6 p.m. 

The show's Saturday line-up 
includes The Beastie Boys, Smash-
ing Puttlpkins, A Tribe Called 
Quest, John Lee H oker, Hugh 
Masalcela, Foo Fighters, Pavement, 
Cibo MallO, Chalcsam Paw, Biz 
Markie and Richie Haven . 

Sunday's line-up features The 
Red Hot Chili Peppers, The 
Fugees, Bjork, The Skatalites, 
Rage Against the Machine, De La 
Soul, Beck, Yoko Ono and Ima, 
Buddy Guy, Chaksam Paw and 
Sonic Youth. 

Proceeds from the show will go 
to the MILA Repa fund, which rais-
es awareness of political and reli-
gious persecution in Tibet. 

Tickets sell for $28.50 for one 
day, or $50 for both days.

The morning started with plenly of hangover

scripted a beller result for the annuel Sun God 
Intramural Sports Festival held last May 18th. 
With tremendous weather, rabid crowds, and an 
excellent participation turn·out, this year's edition 
of Sun God IMs far surpassed previous efforts. 

Outdoor 5-on·5 Basketball had one of its bet-
ter turnouts with over 30 teams teeing ~ up in two 
divisions, The 9 foot rims led to day long excite-
ment and when the smoke had cleared, Fuzzy 
Pickle had done just that in the Open Division, 
while Or. J3 ran off and hid with the tntermedlate 
title. 

Sun God Floor Hockey maxed out as well as 
12 teams slung hockey pucks for two consecu· 
tive days to datermine champions in two divisions. 
Leigh" The Animar Hsu 

led Who Needs Subs to a 4-2 win in the Open 
Cl4l, while Stephanie Dba helped No Ice bring 
home the Intermediate Cup. 

4-on·4 Football kicked off the event early 
Saturday morning and as the sun began to 
break through about mid·morning, the touch· 
down festival was on. No surpise In this evant 
as Rob Richards' Cochese gang annexed an 
1M historical first with a football triple crown 
(Men's AM. Hawaiian, and 4-on·4) 

The new sport on the festival block turned 
out to be a real knock-your-socks 011 affair that 
featured a lot of one-touch passing, quick goals, 
and a short field that led to non-stop action. As 
darkness prevailed, and the lights came on at 
Muir Field, the Moo Shu Family survivad the 
day's events with an impressive 6·2 romp In 
the finals. 

A special thanks goes out to this year's 
generous Sun God Sports Festival spon-

'KRAFTY 
DAN KRAfT 

Arrivederci 
How do you sum up three 

years of your life? When I sat 
down to write this, that was my 
goal. But the more I think about 
it, the more impossible it seems . 

. After three years at or near the 
helm of the Guardian sports 
"machine," I finally have the 
opportunity to set my title aside 
in favor of free time. 

There are innumerable 
memories and insights that go 
with me, however. Among the 
things that stick out in my 
memory are a last-second 
basketbaJl victory my freshman 
year. It was the single most 
exciting Triton event at which to 
be a fan since I've becn here at 
UCSD. 

My tenure has also left me 
with a few things I would like to 
get off my chest. Number one: 
UCSD fans suck. Like Count 
Dracula or a Hoover power vac, 
Triton students are the epitome 
of poor fandom. I have been to 
more UCSD athletic events then 
I ean count and the cheers are 
always feeble at best. 

Perhaps UCSD students 
should dismount their high 
academic horses, and realize thai 
one of ihe reasons being a Triton 
i SO dull is because no one 
bothe~ to cheer for the home 
learn. Who gives a rats patooLJe 
if the home team resides in 
Division Ill? Who says that has 
to take the fun out of beating up 
on a rival school? 

It has always amazed me 
how averse the administration is 
to any move that hinted at an 
intent to increase the stature of 
sports on this campus. Are 
athletics such an obstacle to 
maintaining a sound academic 
reputation? Look at UCLA, an 

instit~tion perceived as among 
the nalion' s best, and one that 
gained its notoriety by winning 
basketballiities under Bruin 
legends such as Lou Alcindor 
and John Wooden. Name a 
UCLA professor. Enough said. 

Would a degree from that 
campus be so valued in today's 
job market if not for Wooden, 
Alcindor and company'! Hell no. 

It would be the UCSD 
administration's worst night-
mare: imagine if the only way 
UCSD could ever claw its way 

• into the upper echelon of U.S. 
universities (U.S. News and 
World Report's top 25) was by 
making a name for itself 
athletically; to win those few 
exira votes by virtue of name 
recognition. Did I just hear a 
pained shriek from the 
chancellor's office? 

Okay, I reaJly have no basis 
on which to make these 
arguments, so I'll take two steps 
back, have a smile and a coke 
and retire. 

Thanks 10 all the UCSD 
coaches and athletes who made 
interviews u cinch. Thanks to 
the boys in '.1. for filling all my 
requests. AI I no thanks to 

• UCSD, you Hoover-esque sport 
fans you. ('miss the sports 
themselve " but the atmosphere 
as a whole could use some fine 
tuning. Recommended tools: a 
'ledge hammer and chain saw. 

The decision had already been 
made. UC Davis was 10 be Ihe benefi-
Ciary of the swimming talents pos-
ses ed by Carrie Parker, a senior at 
Alameda High School. 

Alameda, a lillie island in the Bay 
Area, is three-miles-wide and home 
to a sub-par swimming program that 
just happened to house a gem in the 
making. With the leiter of intent 10 
allend Davis waiting 10 be signed, 
Parker got a call f~m her brother. 

The UCSD Guardian 

PORTS 

"[He] called me and asled what I 
was doing," Parker recalled. " I said, 
'I'm gomg to Davis, I've made my 
decision,' and he wa like, 'don't go 
there.' So, I new down here, had a 
great time and decided to go here." 

The rest is UCSD swimming his-
tory. Parker became lhe most prolific 
pool shark in the annals of Triton 
swimming. Her clutch performances 
were as predictable as Old Faithful. 
At career's end, Parker was a 25-time 

All-American. She competed in the 
maximum 28 events at NCAAs dur-
ing her four years in San Diego. She 
was a two-time UCSD swimmer of 
the year, and for good reason. 

"Carrie is the toughesl person that 
we've ever had come through here, 
mentaJlyandphysicaJly,"UCSDHead 
Swimming Coach Doug Boyd said. 
"She's real tough in the pool, a tough 
competitor and the ultimate team 
player."

four-year 
career as the

Despite her many honors, how-

final NCAA Championship meel 
withoutanational titletohername.One 
of her most vivid memories was also 
as close as she had come. The elting 
was the 1995 NCAA Championships. 
The race was lhe 400-yard freestyle

the perenmal national champs. 

Parker entered the pool with a lead,

J.J. CASTNER: 
What more can be 
said of this Triton 
legend, the best-
ever distance 
runner at UCSO. 
He finished his 
career as a two-
time All-American 
in track and as the school record holder 
in the 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 meters. 

TARA 
MONA.HAN: 
UCSO's 
Outstanding 
Female Field 
Athlete of the 
Year for 1996, 
Monaghan was a 
two-time national 
qualifier in the hammer throw and also 
the school record holder in the event. 

RANDY 
aUEHUR: A fifth-
year senior who 
came up with a 
career-best 
performance at 
this year's NCAA 
Championships to 
take third place 
and earn All-American status. Will be 
graduating Magna Cum laude. 

Judging a team purely by numbers is about 
as reliable as holding your finger up in the wind 
and Irying to guess if it's going to rain. For 
UCSD track and field head coach Ted Van 
Arsdale, this season 's successful numbers don't 
indicate the real progress that the Triton team 
has made. 

That progress, according to the coach, lies in 
UCSD's rise in stature among California 
schools. The Triton men and women were a 
combined 13-5 in dual meets this season, broke 
six school records and claimed six Ali-Ameri-
can awards. 

''The team as a whole continued to press 
itself as one of the track and field leaders in the 
state and maintained itself as the best combined 
program in San Diego," Van Arsdale said. 

However, Van Arsdale isjust as proud of the 
fact that this year's team hosted the biggest 
meet in school history. The Spring Break Open 
offered a venue to some 2,400 athletes, includ-
jng competitors from Divisions I, II and m, in 
addition to inlernational athletes. 

The Tritons will have to struggle next year 10 
overcome the loss of 16 seniors who e time on 
the UCSD track has come 10 an end. Among 
them are 1.J. Castner, Michaela Monahan and
