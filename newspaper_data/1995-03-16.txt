Connerly Draws 
Fire at L.A. Rally 
LOS ANGELES - Over 30 
students held a rally and press 
conference outside Regent 
Tirso Del Junco 's to Los 
Angeles office to voice their 
dissatisfaction with the 
members of the UC Board of 
Regents who oppose affirma-
tive action. The event was 
organizep by the Alliance for 
Equal Learning Opportunities. 
Students referred to comments 
made by Regent Ward 
Connerly at the January UC 
Board of Regents' meeting 
against affirmative-action 
policies and denounced Del 
Junco for his alleged anti-
affirmative action and pro-fee-
increase views.

UCLA Supports 
Student lobbying 
LOS ANGELES - The 
student government voted 
recently to support the 
University of California 
Student Association's position 
supporting the use of manda-
tory student fees to lobby on 
student issues. Current UC 
Office of the President 
(UCOP) guidelines do not 
permit such lobbying based on 
the }993 Smith v. Regents 
decision, which prohibit the 
use of mandatory student fees 
to fund campu organizations 
deemed to be political , 
religious or ideological in 
nature.

Chancellor Defends 
Affirmative Action 
LOS ANGELES - Chancel-
lor Charles Young began his 
week-long campaign in 
support of affirmative action 
with a point-by-point defense 
of admissions and faculty 
recruitment in the UC system. 
In his speech to the Academic 
Senate, Young said that 
UCLA's affirmative- action 
system has produced positive 
results in his 26-year tenure as 
chancellor. Young has been 
criticized by several regents 
for speaking out against them, 
specifically for his calling 
Regent Ward Cannerly the 
affirmative- action "mouth-
piece" of Gov. Pete Wilson.

House to Vote on Student Loans

CONGRESS: Future 
of Stafford loans will 
be decided today 

dized Stafford Loans as well as a bill 
which would eliminate $1.7 billion 
previously approved for student 
loans and grants in the 1995 fiscal 
year. 

Stafford Loan subsidy say it is too 
costly for taxpayers. 

"Because this is the largest pro-
posed cut ever in the history of fi-
nancial aid, it will be truly devastat-
ing to education," she added. 

San Diego Congressman Brian 
Bilbray was unavailable for com-
ment. The elimination of loan subsi-

dies could translate into a 20-per-
cent increase in the cost of educa-
tion for students borrowing the maxi-
mum amount. Over a four year pe-
riod, a student can borrow $17,125 
in subsidized Stafford Loans. If the

With both Democrats and Re-
publicans scrambling to champion 
the middle class through competing 
tax-cuts, college students may be 
among the first to shoulder the ex-
pense. 

The government currently pays 
accrued interest on subsidized stu-
dent loans as long as the student 
remains in school. Students awarded 
unsubsidized loans are required to 
pay the monthly interest while at-
tending school or compound the in-
terest on top of the loan's principal. 

According to the United States 
Student Association (USSA), this 
cut would have a dramatic effect on 
students' abi I ity to fi nance their edu-
cation. 

The House of Representatives 
will vote today on the fates of subsi-

Rally Protests Lack of Student Input Into 
The $2.5 Million Library Walk Project 
DEMONSTRATION: Students 
present Atkinson with petition; 
chances of stopping project slim 
By Marianne Vigil 
News Editor 

Approximately 50 students gathered outside 
the University Library last Monday to protest the 
lack of student involvement in the $2.5 million 
Library Walk, a proposed walkway which will run 
from the University Library 'to the Cellular and 
Molecular Medicine building. 

The rally was organized by the Angry Students 
Concerned by University Spending (ASCUS), 
which consists of various student groups, includ-
ing CALPIRG, the Student Environmental Action 
Coalition (SEAC), College Democrats and the co-
ops. 

"We just wanted to get students concerned 
about student rights," said SEAC member Monica 
Lemos. "This $2.5 million project is extravagant 
and it could have been used to address students' 
academic needs instead." 

Students were successful in arranging a meet-
ing with Chancellor Richard Atkinson on Tues-
day, though Villagomez said that the meeting 

"proved to be futile." 
At the meeting, coalition members .presented 

Chancellor Atkinson with 1,500 petition signa-
tures protesting the Library Walk. 

"He [Chancellor Atkinson] said he would go 
on with the plan anyway," said Villagomez, who 
attended the meeting. "He was very unwilling to 
listen to our concerns. In the end, he didn 't answer 
any of our questions or address our concerns." 

"The outcome of the meeting was that the 
students recognized and accepted that the project 
is going to go forward," said Director of Student 
Affairs Nicholas Aguilar. 

Aguilar also said Chancellor Atkinson ac-
knowledged the difficulty of involving students 
in campus decision-making. "He asked the stu-
dents to submit proposals for ways of improving , 
the current campus decision-making process," he 
added. 

According to Aguilar, approximately 20 stu-
dents were involved in the planning of the project 
through various advisory groups on campus. 

Both Lemos and Villagomez agree that at this 
point, students cannot effectively stop Library 
Walk, "unless we're willing to pin ourselves to 
trees or something, which I don't think will hap-
pen," said Lemos. 

Bomb Scare 
Forces 
Evacuation 
POLICE: Pol ice respond to 
report of strange package 
delivered to Bonner Hall 
By Jonna Palmer 
News Editor 

Occupants of the fourth floor at Bonner 
Hall were evacuated yesterday after a staff 
member discovered a suspicious package at 
about 2:45 p.m. 

According to UCSD Police Sergeant Tom 
Morris, when the staff member picked up 
the box, she noticed that it seemed to fit the 
description of a "suspicious package" and 
phoned the police. 

Universities around the country have been 
sending out notices to staff members with 
details of what a typical mail-bomb package 
looks like, Morris said. He added that people 
at several universities have been killed by 
bombs in packages. 

Morris said the two-foot-Iong package 
had "funny wrapping," along with more 
writing than was necessary to mail the pack-
age, signs of a potential mail-bomb. 

Chemistry Professor Emeritus Bruno 
Zimm, the man to which the package was 
addressed, said he was not expecting any-
thing in the mail. 

"It was a very strange-looking package 
on the outside," he said. 

Zimm added the package had no return 
address, but that the postmark indicated the 
box had been mailed from Winchester, CA. 

Zimm said he had learned about the tell-
tale signs of potential mail-bombs through 
the university electronic mail sy tem a couple 
of months ago. 

After looking at the package, the UCSD 
Police called in the San Diego Metro Strike 
Team, San Diego Fire Department Bomb 
Squad and requested the services of a San 
Diego Police Department dog. 

"There was a lot of fussing around with 
cops getting the bomb squad ... ," said Zimm. 

The team first used an X-ray to examine 
the contents of the package, which revealed 
a jumble of objects including what looked 
like metal nails. 

"It was hard to say exactly what [was in 
the package]," said Morris. 

Since the contents of the package re-

Sexual Harassment 
Taken to Extremes 

Sexual harassment cases are running rampant. There is no 
telling who will find which actions offensive or of the harassing 
sort. Because of the ambiguity of sexual-harassment laws, many 
people seem to be taking advantage of the system, filing lawsuits 
against anyone and everyone who happens to cross the thin line 
between "offensiveness" and "harassment." 

CSU Sacramento student Craig Rogers recently filed a sexual-
harassment complaint with the State Board of Control, seeking 
$2.5 million for the mental anguish, pain and distress he claims 
he suffered during guest lecturer Joanne Marrow's pre$Cntation in 
his psychology class last December. Marrow had allegedly 
encouraged masturbation, displayed pictures of young girls' 
genitals and described her own sexual experiences. 

Though Marrow's actions may have been somewhat unethical, 
particularly in describing her sexual experiences, it is ridiculous 
for Rogers to claim that he, in a classroom of many, had been 
personally harassed. The fact that he found her lecture intimidat-
ing or offensive does not constitute a $2.5 million compensation 
of taxpayers ' money. 

In keeping with academic freedom, no professor should have 
to walk on eggshells around sexual subject malter. However, 
Rogers is taking advantage of Marrow's decision to speak freely 
on her chosen topic. Perhaps he is merely testing the rules, but 
the price tag for this is simply outrageous. Sadly, cases such as 
this are not only a waste of money, but serve to discredit serious 
sexual harassment cases whose victims endure far more than a 
lecture consisting of possibly embarrassing issues. 

Accordiog to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEQq, sexual harassment includes "unwanted sexual advances, 
requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of 
a sexual nature." Though Marrows may have filled the require-
ment of the latter, it's highly unlikel y that anything she said 
during her lecture was aimed at a particular individual. 

Fortunately, ~he State BOard of Control tentatively rejected 
Rogers' claim. Unfortunately, this allows him to file a lawsuit in 
the California Supreme ('..oUrl. 

If Rogers truly suffered sexual harassment during Marrow's 
lecture, either he would have something more concrete than 
"distress" to describe what he experienced or other students in his 
class would have had similar complaints. Rogers' "case" is just 
another example of sexual harassment taken to extremes. 

Ubrary Walk is Wasteful 
Use of Campus Resources 

Administrators were certainly thrown a curveball when they 
found the seemingly innocuous Library Walk - a $2.5 million, 
quarter-mile pathway which will stretch from the Cellular and 
Molecular Biology Building to the Central University Library -
surrounded by a swirl of campus protest. Spearheaded by Physics 
Professor Jorge Hirch, who delivered an impassioned plea at last 
month 's Academic Senate to "save the trees" which will be 
bulldozed for the new walkway, the Library Walk controversy 
has taken on the air of a strange circus sideshow. Exposing bogus 
university information that 50 percent of 230 trees in the eucalyp-
tus grove near the Price Center are on death 's bed, Hirch pushed 
the Walk into the spotlight. 

Since joining the fray, student groups such as the California 
Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG), Student Environ-
mental Action Committee (SEAC) and the College Democrats 
have backed away from the tree-killing hysteria - 680 trees 
will be planted after construction - and have shifted to more 
substantive issues such as student involvement in university 
decision-making and the Waik's arguably obscene price tag. 
During the Walk protest at the University Library on Monday, a 
new student coalition emerged - Angry Students Concerned 
by University Spending (ASCUS) - which will allegedly 
continue to fight for such issues. 

While few doubt that the Walk will be a nice addition to 
UCSD - it may actually be the campus center which planners 
hope - many students are rightly dismayed at .its extravagant 
cost. When shrinking budgets, fee increases and downsizing is 
the nonn, when many old buildings need repair, upgrading and 
renovation, spending $2.5 million on a patbway seems like a less-
than-wise use of Owtcellor Richard Atkinson's discretionary 
funding.

A.S. FOOTBALL PROPOSAL 
. SHOULD BE BENCHED 

COMMENTARY: The proposed Triton football team is a wasteful 
and expensive idea which most students can't afford 

BRENT 

J0lH150n 
Smells Like 
The Truth 

Just when it appeared our 
student government was ac-
tually something more 
than a gathering of would-be-
socialites-in-training, some 
A.S. members proved other-
wise by supporting the Cam-
pus Life Bill. 

This is the same A.S. 
which threw a fit over the UC 
regents' noises to once again 
raise student 
fees. They 
organized 
the "Take the 
Shirts Off 
Our Backs, 

tional $4.50 would go to A.S. Programming events. 
Perhaps we need increases in our Student Activ-

ity Fee to support our existing sports programming, 
even if these programs have been - by the design 
of the university - supporting themselves success-
fully for years. Perhaps we even need an increase in 
fees to cover A.S Programming events which c;:ost 
upward of $10,000 -like the recent Untouchables 
concert at the Price Center (an event attended by 
perhaps a couple hundred students). But a football 
team? Why? 

According to one of the original 
drafters of the bill and Interfraternity 
Council President Greg "Football Is 
Culture" Hearn, UCSD gets no support 
from its alumni because "most alumni 
didn't enjoy coming here." I wonder 
if Hearn took a poll among dissatis-
fied alumni who complained that their 
college experience was less fulfilling 
because the university lacked a foot-
ball team.

hundreds of students' T-shirts which

things, Broadway Street (the location 
ofUC Regent John Davies' office) and 
the Price Center. The culmination of 
the campaign occurred Feb. 15 at the 
Price Center with "UCSD Un-
plugged," an all-night concert which 
greeted the regents, who were attend-
ing their annual meeting at the Price 
Center Ballroom, with a grand display 
of protest. 

At the time, the A.S. impressed me 
as well as much of the student body 
with its commitment to represent stu-
dent needs. "Take the Shirts Off Our 
Backs, But Don't Raise Our Fees" 
was a necessary and successful ex-
pression of the students' dissatisfac-
tion with the U.C. fee hikes. But now, 
A.S. support of the Campus Life Bill

Hearn: Hi, I'm Greg 'Cultured ' 
Hearn, Interfraternity Council presi-
dent. I was wondering if you would 
support UCSD in anything at all even 
though there never was a football team 
here while you attended the school. 

Dissatlsfted Alumnus: Well, Greg, 
I would support one of the best schools 
in the nation in which I received a top-
notch education. But as it is, J feel my 
college experience at UCSD was un-
enjoyable for lack of a football team, 
although I chose to attend a school 
which didn 't have one. Sorry buddy, 
but no can do.

sir. When I graduate from this school,

tution in the world would recognize as

dent Activity Fee, which would amount to $129 per 
year. 

And for what? What exactly would we get out of 
this so-called "Campus Life Bill?" Fifteen dollars 
would go to a National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion (NCAA) Division III football team, $10 dollars 
would go to intramural and c1ubaporta and an addi-

excellent academic credentials, I probably won't sup-
port it as an alumni for lack of a football team, either. 

Hearn seems to assume that everyone believes foot-
ball is an important facet of the American university 
and American culture. Nobody came here to watch 
football . Everyone came for an affordable education 
atone of the best universities in the country.lfUCSD

WHAT KAPLAN DOESN'T TELL You 

JENNY 

Linn 

Having a col-
umn makes for a 
unique opportunity 
to provide a public 
service; I would 
therefore like to 
take this chance, the 
week before finals, 
to discuss good 
study skills. 

The best way to 
study is as follows: 
Attend all your 
classes, and every 

Jaundiced I evening after your 
class go through 
your notes and out-

line the most important aspects of the lecture. 
Read all the material required for each class, 
take notes and outline your readings. Then, 
when exam week comes around, you'll 
merely need to glance over your notes and 
refamiliarize yourself with the concepts. This 
method is currently used by at least seven of 
UCSD's 16,000 students, and I'm told it 's 
rather effective.

the sides of the margins

amusing to look back and 
see who you or she or 
whomever it was you 
were gossiping about was 
dating back in January. 
That crazy woman! At this 
-time you will smile and 
reach for the telephone, 
because you just reaIize:d 
you haven't talked to her 
since at Ieut this morning. 
But you must fight the 
impulse to pick up the 
phone, and get back to 
studying. 

All right, you'ye

You leave a message 
on her machine and go 
back to your books. 
Where were we? Okay, 
you've highlighted your 
notes. I find positive rein-
forcement to be a good 
study technique - that is, down

yourself by gelling your-

Or you will realize, when 
you open the cupboard to 
get the popcorn, how 
faded your shelf paper is, 
and how badly it needs re-
placing, right this very 
minute! 

When studying for ex-
ams, we seize the oppor-
tunity to do some repug-
nant task with great joy, 
simply because it isn't 
studying. We won't allow 
ourselves to do fun things 
when we're preparing for 
exams, but for some rea-
son we justify doing 
things like preparing our 
income taxes or washing 
our windows. Since it's 
disagreeable, but has to be 
done, it makes us feel 
slightly virtuous, which 
helps cut back on the guilt 
we feel from not studying. 

All right, you've high-
lighted your notes, gotten 
a snack and - after clean-
ing your kitchen, bed-
room and bathroom -

There are, of course, other methods; the 
following is the procedure which I usually 
use. During the quarter you mayor may not 
do the readings, depending on: a) whether you 
feel like it or b) if you bought the textbook. 
The day before your final, or possibly two 
days if you're really motivated, set aside time 
to study for your exam. 

self a snack. This, however, requires great dis-
cipline. 

The reason this is such a dangerous move 
is that you must get up from your desk and go 
into your kitchen. Several perils lurk inside. 
First, you will see the sin~ full of dirty dishes 
and you will immediately decide to wash 
them. Or you will notice, for the first time in 
four months, how dirty your kitchen floor is. 

have sat back down approximately an hour 
later. Now is the time to draw out the key 
points from the readings. You open your book 

The first thing to do is to look over all your 
notes from the course and highlight impor-
tant ideas. It usually results in you painting 
your notebook florescent yellow while you 
smile at the little notes you and your friend

- and promptly plunge into guilty despair for 
letting yourself get 14 chapters behind. What 
were you doing all quarter, you yell at your-
self. Now that you have one day, one day be-
fore the exam, how are you going to learn all 
this? The answer is you won't learn anything 

from the readings if you scan them cnzily, 
especially if you stay up all night pouring over 
them like a maniac. 

With any luck, however, you 've done at 
least some of the reading and may have even 
scribbled some notes down from them. Good. 
Incorporate those with your lecture notes. 
(With any luck, they might even be related.) 

Time for another reward! How about some 
music? You go over to the stereo and, fight-
ing the urge to dust your bookcase, look over 
your music collection for suitable study mu-
sic. Nothing with words: too distnctil18. a.-
sical is excellent. I've heard that Mozart 
makes people smarter. I always wondered 
what it is about Mozart exactly that causes 
this result. Why does the music of Beethoven, 
Handel or Grieg lack these inteIligence-en-
hancing effects? What happens when you lis-
ten to them? Is there music which lowers your 
IQ when you listen to it? Besides Michael 
Bolton, that is? 

Now that you've put on Mozart and dusted 
your bookcase and end tables, you can go back 
to studying. But then, the phone rings. You 
leap up again to answer it. It's some of your 
classmates. Some friends are getting together 
for a study group. 

If you have enough time, studying with a 
friend or group can be helpful. People in my 
department are big on group study, and I've 
come to rely on it. Depending on your group, 
you may find that other people have done all 
the reading, attended and understood every 
lecture and can explain everything to you. Or, 
as is usually the case with the people with 
whom I study, they 've slacked about as much 
as I have. But the small amount of informa-

STUDENTS SHOULD CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST FEE HIKES 
EdItor: 

We are witnessing ~ historic 
change in the UC system. At the 
last regents meeting, right in the 
middle of a student protest, UC 
President Jack Peltason and the 
regents decided to delay action on 
the 1995-96 fee increases. Some 
even talked about ways to obtain 
money to avert a fee increase. Un-
til now, very few regents have had 
the courage to come out on this is-
sue. 

But the problem now shifts to 
the state government. While Gov. 
Pete Wilson's budget makes 
some token gestures for higher 
education, it does nothing to ad-
dress the threat of closing access 
to the UC. His "compact" - a 
proposed two-percent increase in 
university funding next year and 
a four-percent increase the fol-
lowjng three years - supports 
four more years of skyrockr.ting 
fees, at almost five times above 
the inflation rate. 

Wilson tries to mask this grim 
reality by providing more money 
for financial aid. But many stu-
dents are ineligible because their 

parents make too much money-
even though these students don't 
receive any parental support. In 
addition, students who are eli-
gible for aid often do not receive 
enough. Now, we face the elimi-
nation of federal financial-aid 
programs. 

What can we do? We should 
write to our state legislators to 
get them to understand the des-
perate financial situations of 
many students, while at the same 
time showing how much we ap-
preciate the opportunity to attend 
this outstanding public univer-
sity. 

All Democratic state senators-
a majority - and one Independent 
signed a letter to the governor slat-
ing they would not support any fee 
increase. Two new ex-officio re-
gents, U. Gov. Grey Davis and Su-
perintendent of Public Instruction 
Delaine Eastin have strongly voiced 
their opposition to further fee in-
creases. 

The University of California 
Student Association is coordinating 
student actions across the UC 
against the fee increases. We have

I have to respond to the letter 
"Slave Auction Event Insulting" 
(March 13, 1995). I find it sicken-
ing that 11 members of the A.S. and! 
or college councils find a slave auc-
tion insulting. 

Personally, I think this has gone 
too far. I have participated in slave 
auctions in the past (I was not at 
the one on March 8) and drawing 
the connoction to the slavery of Af-
ricans (or Jews or of any slavery 
perpetrated in history) is outland-
ish and weak. Slave auctions are 
simply kinky versions of date auc-
tions. 

Will we next protest walk-a-

are "a slap in the face" to those 
whose forefathers were forced on

My bold-letter quote about Li-
brary Walk ("Care For A Walk?" 
March 13, 1995) was taken out of 
context. It was made during a dis-
cussion about fee hikes, losing our 
physical education department and 
RlMAC, which amounts to $34 mil-
lion. Though it has an outrageous 
pricetag, the Library Walk is, in 
comparison, insignificant. 

The real issue is the lack of stu-
dent involvement. Students should 
be told what is going on and have 
some say conceming funds and the 
campus. 

On a final note, A.S. President 
Carla Tesak is quite wrong when she 
states that the protesters are "obvi-
ously uninformed." We are very 
well informed. One party, the re-
gents, simply "forgot" to tell us the 
whole story.

Ultimate DIsc Playen 
Deserve .. Apology 
Editor: 

I demand the Guardian apolo-
gize for insulting all ultimate-disc 
players by printing Sean Rahimi's 
article ("Ultimate What?" March 6, 
1995). He wrote that ultimate disc 
lacks "requirements." He apparently 
knows nothing about the game ex-
cept what he observed during a few 
seconds while "passing by agame." 
Apparently, he was fooled by the 
presence of the disc; he associates 
it with a friendly game of catch, and 
cannot see that it has other uses. If 
he had read the rules of ultimate 
disc, he could have seen that it is a 
sport much like football, soccer and 
basketball. 

IfRahimi tried to play, his team-
mates would quickly see that he is 
incompetent, though he would prob-
ably not realize this himself. Since 
he does not see the requirement of 
getting open, his teammates would 
never throw to him, sparing Rahimi 
the humiliation of repeatedly drop-
ping passes and throwing the disc 
into the other team's hands. Since 
he does not see the requirement of 

, playing defense, Rahimi would not 
notice that all the other team's goals 
were being scored by the player he 
was supposed to be covering.

FOOTBALL: 
e ............... 4 
Ilumni hive a problem with sup-
porting the university because it 
doesn't have a football team, who 
cares? WIIo needs ~t kind of sup-
port anyway? If this is the way 
alumni feel, they can go to hell. 
However. if the alumni are being 
poorly ~praentejl by Hearn - Ind 
I believe they are - then Hearn is 
misleading us. 

The fad that much of tile A,S. 
government - iAcluding Picaident 
Carla TesaIe. perhaps the moot vo-
cal detractor of administration and 
regent fee hikes - is seriously sup-
porting the bill is the ultimate in 
hypocrisy, especially when consid-
ering the time and energy it has put 
into the "Take the Shirts Off Our 
Backs, But Don't Raise Our Fees" 
campaign. The A.S. is supposed to 
represent the interests of the student 
body. Rai~ing student activity fees 
to establish a football team which 
only a minority of students would 
follow is hardly in the students' best 
interests. 

Perhaps some can afford an in-
crease in student activity fees. The 
remaining 90 percent of us, how-
ever, cannot. In the face of increased 
fees, of the ever-rising costs of liv-
ing in San Diego, of the new Re-
publican threat to cut student finan-
cial aid, students cannot afford the 
frivolous expenditures which mem-
bers of the A.S. would like us to un-
dertake by creating a Triton football 
team. 

STUDY: 
Continued from pace 5 
tion which everyone has picked up 
on is slightly different, so we put 
bits and pieces together. 

Unfortunately, group studying 
can be dangerous, especially if it's 
with your closest friends, because 
of temptations to depart from the 
task at hand. An iron will is re-
quired to deter the study group 
from wandering away from fasci-
nating issues such as correlations 
and critical F-values to dull topics 
such as the bab~ you saw in the li-
brary last week. 

Usually, however, you manage 
to find this willpower; it comes 
in the form of the 60 percent of 
your grade which this exam en-
tails, and the wretched 40 percent 
of a grade you've accumulated 
thus far. . 

Now that you've discussed the 
material, gone over your notes and 
reviewed your reading, you are 
ready for the exam. Some people 
can stay up all night and still take a 
test successfu II y. I can 't. I . need a 
good solid night of sleep or I'm 
doomed. Go with whatever method 
works. 

Before the test, avoid the 
classroom until the last second. If 
you stand outside the door, you 
will start listening to the other 
students talking, and it is guaran-
teed they will be discussing 
things they studied and of which 
you have never heard in your life. 
This does your confidence no 
good, and confidence is critical. 
Also, don't bring your notes with 
you and sit frantically scanning 
them while crouched next to the 
door of the classroom two min-
utes before class starts. You won't 
learn anything, and it's also bad 
for your confidence. And, frankly, 
it's undignified. You can remind 
me of that when you see me cram-
ming outside the classroom next 
week.

Dreams Do 
Come True 

When I was a clumsy youth, 
I sauntered about my neighbor-
hood like a wobbly new-born 
colt, boasting of the incredible 
athletic feats which I would be 
able to perform when I grew up 
to be a strapping teen. Then I 
grew up - to a whopping 145 
pounds - and my dreams came 
crashing down about me like too 
much debris from a Shaquille 
O'Neal slam-dunk. 

UCSD Blows Past Cyclones 
HIGHER LEARNING: UCSD took all comers from Division I falling to Penn and topping Iowa State 

No longer could I realisti-
cally envision snaring bulleted 
Joe Montana passes in the back 
of the endzone or soaring in 
from outside the lane and rip-
ping home two-handed slams. 
My life goals were no more. 

Of all my shattered dreams, 
the most prominent by far was 
the hope of someday winning 
"the big one, H and storming the 
field to form the largest dog-pile 
in human history along with my 
drunkenly ecstatic teammates -
prior to getti ng drunk on some-
thing other than ad renaline. 

These dreams appeared long 
gone, however. Then in the fall 
of my freshman year I discov-
ered intramurals and, for a brief 
moment, a glimmer of hope 
flickered across my faded fan-
tasies. Okay, so flag football 
isn 't exactly the Super Bowl, 
and coed soccer bears only the 
slightest resemblance to the 
World Cup - although, I can't 
think of what exactly that would 
be at the moment.

The UCSD women's tennis team 
entered a two-game home stretch on 
Friday in which it would stake its 

undefeated 
. record against 

two stiff Divi -

- University of 
Pennsylvania 
and Iowa State 
University. 

Though suf-
fering their first 
loss of the sea-
son to Penn, 7-2, 
the Tritons (8-1) 

managed to overcome Iowa State 5-
4 to split the two matches. 

On Monday against Iowa, the 
Tritons benefited from some out-
standing performances in their 
singles matches, and had the match 
won even before doubles action 
started. 

The match was played under the 
typical Division I format in which 
singles matches are played at the 
outset, as opposed to the Division 
III system which begins with the 
doubles contests.

SWEEP: The Triton men's tennis team dismantled the University of Rochester (NYl by a 7-0 tally 

As my frustration grew, I 
agai n began to believe that I 
would never experience any-
thing but the "agony of defeat." 
This quarter appeared no differ-
ent as I, and my rag-tag bunch 
of Guardian t~mmates, opened 
the 'A' floor hockey season at 
0-2. Ominously enough we were 
dubbed "Lance Legault's He-
roes." For those of you less- edu-
cated folk out there, that would 
be the frustrated General who 
futilly pursued the" A-Team" 
throughout their 1980s misad-
ventures.

The UCSD men's tennis team improved 
its record against Division III opponents to 
3-0 on Monday with a 7-0 shellacking of the 

University of Rochester 
at the Muir courts. 

The Tritons could do 
no wrong against Roches-
ter, capturing every match 
of the day, and they set 
the stage early in doubles, 
where they systematically 
dismantled their foes. 

At number-one 
doubles, the duo of Rob-
ert Ho and Dan 
Brounstein delivered a 

potent 8-3 shellacking to their adversaries. 
The number-two doubles team of Frank Heeb 
and Mike Wilson was also masterful, defeat-
ing their counterparts with an 8-4 beating. 

Rounding out the doubles play, the num-
ber-three squad of Emil Mihet and Ari 
Marken made an impression by collecting an 
8-4 win in the pro-set. 

In singles competition, Triton ace Ho led 
the way for the UCSD sweep, posting a lop-
sided 6-0, 6-4 triumph. Brounstein, the Tri-
tons' number-two singles player, added to 
UCSD's domination as he cleaned house with 
a 6-4, 6-3 win. Number-three Heeb had more 
difficulty in his match, but the end result was 
the same - a 6-3, 3-6, 5-2 victory. He was 
about to close out the contest in the third set 
when his opponent retired. 

Wilson was the first one off the court, 
showing his opponent no mercy on the way 
to a 6-4, 6-1 shelling at the number-four spot. 

Mihet survived a scare from his opponent 
at number five, winning in three sets after 
overcoming a slow start. Upon losing the first 
set, Mihet dispatched his opponent quick.ly in 
the second and third sets, cruising to a 4-6, 6-
0,6-1 victory. Ping Yeh finished off the sweep 
at number six by hammering his Rochester 
opponent, 6-3,6-3. 

"This was a good match for a young team. 
It allowed us to take the court with a winning 
attitude," Ho said. "If we can keep that atti-
tude, I see no reason why we can't beat ev-
eryone."

DREAMS: Floor 
hockey was the (,lnswer 
ContInued from paae 9 
season by winning three of our last four, and, 
after an opening round playoff victory, I 
began to pray at night that my dreams could 
yet bC:come realities. Then, in tbe semi-fl-

. nals, I experienced the moment I had long 
awaited. Both teams went scoreless through 
three quarters and an overtime shootout, 
before we went to sudden death shots. Af-

ler surviving a posl rattling scare on the first 
shot, Blaine Edwards - a man whose pres-
ence there will forever be remembered by 
myself as the second coming - put home 
the winning shot. 

We ran onto the floor of the ree. gym in 
elated celebration and made what was -
while far short of the world's largest dog-
pile - a damn happy pile of humanity. At 
long lasl, my dreams had come true. Oh, by 
the way, we lost 5-1 won in the champion-
ship in a performance typical of an AFC, 
Super Bowl choke. 

Good luck on finals.

UCSD Reduced to Ashworth 
GOLFERS: The Triton men fall to fifth overall at the USD/ Ashworth Invite 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

You would have thought that the 
UCSD golf team had met plenty of 

obstacles at the 
USD/Ashworth 
Golf Invitational at 

_II' ,.., .• Eastlake Country 
~~~~ll Club on March 13-

14. 
After all, the 

Triton golfers 
clearly had their 
hands full with a 
tough field of Divi-
sion II schools and 

wide fairways that failed to test the 
true strength of UCSD's squad. 

But the true obstacle for the Tri-
tons will come in two weeks, when 
in the words of Head Coach Mike 
Wydra, UCSD will try to avoid "go-
ing off the bridge [on the 1-5] into 
the raging torrent" en route to the 
Modesto tournament. 

As it was, the Tritons performed 
admirably in this week's tourney. 
UCSD grabbed fifth place with a 
final tally of 917 in the Division II 
and III bracket, slipping to its near-
est opponent, UC Davis, by a mere 
six strokes. 

The Tritons shot a 306, 309 and 
a 302 in each successive round on 

event and meriting a 10th-place 
mark overall. 

"I felt that our play was listless 
and spotty," Brown said. 

Alex Behrend grabbed the sec-
ond scoring slot for UCSD with a 
22nd-place, 76-77-75 tally. Fellow 
Tritons Arnie Campbell and Pete 
Roberts - coming off the injury list 
- tied for the third and fourth team 
slots with 
scores of 78-
78-77 and 77-
79-77, respec-
tively. 

"[Roberts] 
has been get-
ting better and 
better. He 's 
playing with . 
pain, and he 
told me that 
he 's not think-
ing about it," 
Wydra said. 

Finishing 
off the Triton 
scoring was 
lordan 
Garrett, who 
shot a fairly 
uninspired 79-
81-80 two-day 
total. 

the friendly course. It was a score " T his 
good enough for a fifth-place finish course had

Tom Brown led the way again fairways, so it 

We're better on tougher courses," 
Wydra said. " It was perfect for [Cal-
State] Stanislaus. We, on the other 
hand, are used to looking down a 
double-bogey with a sneer." 

Next up for the Tritons, follow-
ing the Modesto tourney, is an un-
precedented chance to play on the 
prestigious San Francisco Golf 
Course.

tent 75-75-73 over the two-day ad vantage . Pete Roberts tallied a solid 233 two-day total. 

w. TENNIS: 
Splits with Div. r foes 
ContInued from page 9 
players, Morgan Gessford and Yumi 
Takemoto, rounded out singles play 
with strong wins. Gessford defeated 
Maggie Agustsson 6-4, 6-3, while 
Takemoto had her way with Ann 
Backhaus, garnering the 6-0 6-2 
win. 

Top-seeded Miche ll e 
Malephansakul was the only Triton 
to lose in si ngles, falling 6-1,6-1 to 
Erika Asmuss. . 

With the win already secure, 
UCSD softened up enough in 
doubles for Iowa State to win all 
three. 

"We played a lot better [Mon-
day] than against Penn on Friday," 
Assistant Coach Jeff Bethard said. 

" It was a good win for us." 
Monday's win was in sharp con-

trast with Friday's disappointing 7-
2 loss at the hands of the University 
of Pennsylvania. 

Singles, usually a Triton strong 
point, went overwhelmingly Penn 's 
way. 

On the plus side, Drage im-
pressed, va nqui shi ng Lara 
Afanassiev in straight sets, 6-4, 6-
3. Unfortu natel y, the rest of the 
si ngles scorecard belonged to Penn-
sylvania. The visitors won five of 
the six matches. 

For the first time this season the 
Tritons' top two players, 
Malephansakul and Somers, both 
losl. 

At the top spot, Malephansakul 
suffered an uncharacteristic loss at 
the hands of Barrie Bernstein, 6-1, 
6-0 while Somers fell to Preety 

Sorathia 6-2, 6-2. 
Things did not improve else-

where in the lineup, as the fourth 
and six th seeds, Kurokawa and 
Takemoto, respectively, both were 
on the receiving end of 6-3, 6-2 
margins of defeat. 

Gessford suffered th e othe r 
si ngles defeat in a close three-set 
battle. She lost the first set to Cori 
Sibling 6-2, but turned the tables in 
the second and won it 6-2. Gessford 
lost the third, though, as Sibling 
hung in for the 6-2 win. 

All three doubles contests were 
close, but again Penn came out on 
top, notching two of the three. 

Gessford and Somers played sol-
idly in garnering the Tritons lone 
victory in doubles. They unseated 
Sibling and Andi Grossman at the 
number three position by an 8-6 
tally.

Comm .... tI: 
h's not e~actIy the world cup. but there wi l be small wars out on 
the NCR fields Thursday night (6 and 7pm) trying to decide who 
gets to play in the championship game Sunday at 12noon. 
Loaded seems loaded. but thaJs only on paper . Nate's bloody 
boys and the lads from Ouijebo play serious defense and that 
might get ~ done. 

The Intemational fellas are at h again ... teaching us Yanks how 
the game really should be played. Looks like a walk-over unless 
some local pride shows up come Sunday at 1 pm. 

All of the top-seeded teams are still hanging around but thrs 
diviSIOn usually produces an upset or two 
or three. If you're looking for a darkhorse to get get through try 
2 Win., 2, Lo ..... Ind A Tie. 

This tournament cranks up tonight and really stallS cooking FIf-
day at 5pm at NCR. Buttnut, and Team ADurl know how to 
get goals. but Quljebo plays both ends of the field well. Trash 
talkers delight! 

This is the very best of Coed A bunch that mucked around on 
oor fields this year. All t4 teams that finished either t or 2 in 
their league moved up to Coed AA. Gona Get In looks lough to 
beal in this one. 

The next best teams In Coed A get to play for their ~ divi-
sional championship. h shou1d be interesting for most. but some-
where in this group lies a team thai should have put there sea-
son togett,er sooner. But who? 

There', not much interest left with this groop after the weather 
completely devastated the women's season. and what·s ever 
left will be scooped up by a very dominant Buttercup team.

$ilm's l'iew of JVew Zealand natil'es contrasts 

witli Western lmpressions 

The confrontational style of New Zealand director Lee Tamahori's fLlm, Once Were Warriors, power-fully shows how the culture of the 
indigenous Maoris has been ravaged by the 
effects of urbanization_ Through the 
struggles of a Maori family burdened by 
unemployment and alcoholism, Tamahori 
depicts the brutality and desperation which 
becomes integral to existence in such a 
suffocating environment. 

The image of New Zealand presented in 
Once Were Warriors sharply contrasts with 
Western stereotypes aboUI the country_ 
Tamahori seems well aware of this irony, 
opening the film with a majestic view of a 
desert and mountain range, then panning 
away to reveal that the image is a billboard 
in an urban wasteland. This is where the 
Heke family lives - an environment in 
which the remnants of rural life have been 
literally ripped apart by construction, free-
ways and technological refuse_ Poignantly, 
young Maoris plaster junk yards and under-
passes with graffiti as a claim on the only 
land they can call their own. 

The Maori culture is steeped in male-
initiated violence which expresses the rage 
and helplessness of being trapped in such 
devastating poverty. The father of the Heke 
family, Jake (femuera Morrison), is con-
tinually unemployed and unable to support 
his wife, Beth (Rena Owen), and their five 
children, although he manages to ftnd time 
to lift weights and consume inordinate 
amounts of alcohol on a regular basis. When 
Beth expresses anything other than a will-
ingness to have sex and party with him, Jake 
brutally beats her. 

The day after one especially terrifying 
fight, Beth's friend comes over and jokingly 
inquires if her damaged face was the result 
of an especially intense orgasm_ "You gotta 
keep your mouth shut and your legs open," 
the friend advises. As testament 10 the strict 
gender assignments which abound in the 
film, Beth continues to have her husband's 
meals ready for him as soon as he comes 
home. 

But Beth's personal strength develops as 
we see her sever herself from the IS-year 
marriage in an effort to protect her children 

who have suffered irrevocable damage. 
The eldest son, Nig (Julian Arahanga), 

joins a Maori gang in order to recreate a kind 
of tribal unity based on status and belong-
ing_ The gang members don leather, sun-
glasses, chains and tattoos, sealing their 
fidelity by beating new initiates. The middle 
son, Boogie (faungaroa Emile), gets sent 
away to a reform program and learns about 
his Maori heritage from a male social worker, 
who teaches him less violent methods of 
coping_ 

Aside from the two youngest children in 
the Heke family, the real casualty of Jake's 
violence and alcoholism is the sweet, 13-
year-old daughter, Grace (Mamaengaroa 
Kerr-Bell), who is victimized by her uncle 
during a drunken party at the house. The 
event ultimately leads Beth to gather her 
family together and take charge of their 
collective fate_ 

Unfortunately, the most realistic aspects 
of Once Were Warriors are the portrayals of 
dysfunction, and the didactic ending seems 
hollow, lacking the complexity of the restor 
the film.

Katie 
Hafner 

Former UCSD 
student 

tackles racism 
in new book 

about Gennan 
history 

By Diana Reynolds 
Guardian Reporter 

-;; 

A book about Gennan history may 
seem like an unusual topic for jour-
nalist Katie Hafner. Hafner, a gradu· 
ate of UCSD, usually covers technol· 
ogy issues for Newsweek magazine, 
and her previous book, Cyberpunk, is 
abou t computer hackers and the 
Intemet. 

Yet, during a recent interview, 
Hafner said that her new book pub· 
lished by Scribner, The House at the 
Bridge: A Story of Modem Germany, 
gave herthe chance to retu m to themes 
she tudied whi le at UCSD in the late 
I 970s, 

Hafner enrolled as a freshman at 
UCSO's Third College in 1976, and 
one of her first classes was with Ger-
man Professor Reinhard Lettau, Lettau 
turned out to be a great influence but 
initially didn 't appreciate her writing 

. abilities, 
"The first experience I had at col-

lege was Lettau and his writing work· 
shop. He had me read a story I had 
written out loud in class that first night 
as an example of really bad wri ting," 
she recalled, 

"Lettau let it be known what in-
credibly hard work writing is, and his 
criticism made me determined to be a 
better writer, But then, as my writing 
improved, we got very close." 

Lettau proved to be both apolitical 
and intellectual mentor for Hafner. 
His encouragement led her to pursue 
a German literature major, and she 
credits his political vision as an im-
portantcontribution to her life as well . 

Hafner said that Lettau's political 
radicalism was also an important con-
tribution to the university commu-
nity. 

"He was a real asset to UCSD," 
she said. "Without guys like Lettau 
and his friend Herbert Marcuse, what 
a vanilla place the university would 

Thursday, March 16, 1995 

Katie Hafner just published her second book, 
the Bridge: A Story of Modern Germany. 
be intellectually. Institutions need 
iconoclasts like Lettau ," 

In 1977, Hafner spent her junior 
year at Gottingen, Germany in the 
Education Abroad Program before 
going on to attend the Columbia 
School of Journalism. During her year 
as an exchange tudent in Germany, 
Hafner was confronted with open-
minded German students, But while 
researching The House at the Bridge, 
which chronicles the fate of a villa in 
Potsdam from the 19th century to the 
present, Hafner said she encountered 
an older, less tolerant generation of 
Germans, 

"There is a ton of anti-Semitism 
overin EastGermany,"shesaid. "That 
was very disconcerti ng. I was no longer 
in the sheltered academic world of 
Gottingen, I was in the big, bad world 
of ignorance and prejudice." 

Hafner stressed that Americans 
should educate themselves about Ger-
man culture and history. 

"Germany has been an important 
part of my life for many years, and it 
meant a lot to me to go to Germany 
and to confront modem Gennan his-
tory. I feel very strongly that it is 
important for an American readership 
to learn about Germany in ways that 
are accessible," she said, "Ignorance 

breeds prejudice, and Americans arc 
just as in the dark about East Germans 
as the East Germans are about Jews 
and foreigners," 

Hafner spent two years research· 
ing the material for The House at the 
Bridge, which chronicles the effect 
Germany's political changes haveon 
the villa, She traces the history of the 
house, which is si tuated at the famous 
Glienicke Bridge, the site of many 
Cold War spy exchanges, 

Eventually, the house was turned 
into a kindergarten, and the Berlin 
Wall cut through the its front yard, 
Now, it's empty and in ruins, having 
been returned to the Waillich family , 
its original owners. 

Hafnersaid she took the first scene 
of her book from a Kafka short story 
she read in a German literature class, 
For her, the house provides a meta-
phor for Germany 's history. 

"One Kafka story, 'Up in the Gal-
lery,' is only two paragraphs long, but 
it is about the problem of reality ver-
sus perception," she said. "I borrowed 
that idea of reality versus perception 
for the opening of The House at the 
Bridge. To rich Westerners, this house 
is a beautiful, old villa, Their percep-
tion does not see the reality of the 
wreck this house has become."

PJ Harvey 
To Bring You My Love 

........ Record. 

Faithful be warned: This ain't the 
PJ Harvey of Rid of Me fame. Two 
years after releasing her sophomore 
effort, a wonderfully pissed-off 
chronicle of lost love and self-unrav-
eling, Polly Jean Harvey seems to 
have mellowed. On her newest out-
ing, To Bring You My Love, Harvey 
pulls her big, bad guitar out of the 
spotlight - even throwing in key-
board and faux beats on some tracks 
- and of tens her biting feminist 
edge. Co-produced by Flood (U2), 
it 'sasafer,morepalatableworkwhich, 
many critics have 
gushed, could land 
Harvey a spot in 
the lucrative alter-
native market. 

While it could 
be dismissed as a 
sellout, My Love 
seems more of a 
rebirth than an in-
dustry-driven 
compromi e. Af-
terreleasingRidof 
Me, Harvey herselfchided the album ' 
formulaic noise/silence structure -
guitar dissonance followed by whis-
pered choruses and timid guitarstrums 
- and My Love reflects a conscious 
movement toward new musical 
ground. 

However, Harvey 's infatuation 
with motherhood, a theme which sur-
faces through the album, may also be 
central to this shift. Breaking from the 
angry, androgynou image she culti-
vated on Rid of Me, Harvey grapples 
with the implications of pregnancy on 
several tracks, including the folksy 
(and somewhat canned) "C'Mon 
Billy" and the muffled, low-fi "IThink 

J'maMother." As would be expected, 
Harvey 's mediations swell with con-
tradiction and ambivalence, and sit 
against a backdrop of romantic heart-
break and feminist-informed anger 
- the twin pillars of her work. 

While die-hard Harvey fans may 
feel pangs of disappointment - she 
has clearly lost some of her edge -
My Love features a number of worth-
while, and in some cases powerful, 
songs. The brooding, blues-inspired 
title track, which is as much a homage 
toa lost loverasold-school blues men, 

showcases 
Harvey's consid-
erable vocal tal-
ent and proves 
he can still craft 

solid, evocative 
music. With lines 
such as "I was 
born inthedesertl 
Jesus come 
closer/I think my 
time is near " the 
song drips with 

Harvey 's iconoclastic religiosity and 
tragic romanticism. 

However, on songs such as the 
grunge-lite "Long Snake Moan" and 
the low, narcotic "Working for the 
Man," Harvey return to the personal-
political, m unting uncharacteristi-
cally quiet assault" on patriarchy and 
gender roles. Other standouts include 
"Telco" and the current radio hit, 
"Down by the Water," which hints at 
the possibilities of a post-noise, post-
revolutionary Harvey. 

Unfortunately, that vision still lags 
beyond the blood, sweat and disso-
nance of her earlier work.

MaHhew 
Sweet 
100% Fun 

Zoo Entert.ln .... nt 

Singer-guitarist Matthew 
Sweet titled his new album 100% 
Fun to show his themes are not as 
dark as those on his previous six 
albums. Yet, in the opening track, 
"Sick of Myself," Sweet sings 
about an addictive yet destructive 
relationship, and his twisted sense 
of irony runs throughout ]00% 
FUll . Assisted by ex-Television 
guitarist Richard Lloyd, Sweet 
cranks out everything from pop 
ballads ('Get Older") to bluesy 
rock ("Giving it Back") with 
enough dexterity to merit com-
parisons with singer-songwriters 
like Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. 

Laughing 
Hyenas 

Hard Times 
Touch 'n' Go Recorda 
Laughing Hyenas sound like a 

perverted version of the Rolling 
Stones. Like the Stone , the Hy-
enas arc influenced by blues pio-
neers such as John Lee Hoo 'er 
and Howlin ' Wolf. But Laughing 
Hyenas inject doses of hard roc 
which the Stones wouldn't touch. 
While not as intense as Je us Liz-
ard or as off-beat as Jon Spencer 
Blues Explosion, Laughing Hy-
enas trike a nerve with their grim 
look at working-class life in"Hard 
Time Blues" and "Each Dawn I 
Die." 

Laughing Hyenas will perform 
on March 23 at the Casbah.
