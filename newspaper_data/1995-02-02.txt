Ex-Gan. Members 
Hold Forum at UCLA 
LOS ANGELES - Former 
gang members and Los 
Angeles community leaders 
recently held a forum to 
discuss solutions to gang 
warfare at UCLA's Rolfe Hall. 
The event, which attracted 
only} ~all audience, was 
organized by UCLA's 
Multicultural Society and the 
UCLA African Student Union. 
The speakers were part of the 
Community in Support of the 
Gang Truce, founded in 1992 
by Dewayne Holmes, who 
helped foster a truce among 
rival gangs. Former opposing 
gang members Twilight Bay 
and Juan Longino said that 
gangs have become more 
violent due to the L.A. Police 
Department's "abuse of 
power" in the 1980s.

Residents Warned of 
Recent Sexual Assault. 
CRIME: Attack at Nobel Dr. 
condo could be connected to 
another incident in the county 
By Marianne Vigil 
News Editor 

The San Diego Police are warning La 
Jolla-area residents to be cautious when 
openning their doors to strangers in response 
to a sexual assault and hot prowl burglary 
which took place in the 3700 block of Nobel 
Drive on Jan. 24 at approximately 1 p.m. 

The victim was a 33-year-old female. 
According to San Diego Police, the suspect 
entrance the victim's apartment on the pre-
tense of needing to use her telephone. The 
victim was then assaulted and her apartment 
was ransacked. The victim was taken to a 
local hospital to be treated for injuries re-
lated to the assault. She was later released. 

The suspect, who ~as believed to be 
armed with a knife, escaped in the victim 's 
car, a 1989 metallic blue BMW 325i, two-
door, with California license plate number

Study Calls for 
Drastic Changes 
In Education 
BUDGET: Wilson urged to declare 
"state of emergency" for higher 
education in California 
By Ben Elgin 
Guardian Reporter 

Citing a projected 50 percent increase in California's 
college-age population in the next 12 years and the 
state's ongoing economic crisis, the California Higher 
Education Policy Center has urged Gov. WiI"l)n to 
declare a "state of emergency" for higher education in 
a report released Sunday. 

David Breneman, Harvard professor of education 
and author of the report, called for long-term solutions 
to the fiscal crises facing the state's systems of higher 
education. 

"While 'muddling through' might suffice for a few 
years with limited damage to student access ... it is a 
recipe for disaster if continued, given the demographic 
tidal wave about to wash over the state," 
Breneman tated in the report. 

Another study conducted by the Rand Corporation 
predicted higher education will obtain less than four 
percent of California's General Fund expenditures by 
2002, compared to the 13 percent it will receive in 
1995. These statistics translate into several hundred 
thousand students who will be turned away from the 
CSU system alone, according to the Rand Corpora-
tion. 

Mike Alva, spokesman for the UC Office of the 
President, said he believes that the problems have 
already been acknowledged and solutions are being 
explored. 

"There is a sense from [Breneman] that nothing is 
being done to accommodate the increase in students 
and this is wrong," Alva said. "The state knows these 
projections ... and the goal is to accommodate as many 
students as possible given the state's fiscal [situa-
tion]," he added. 

Breneman proposed that California grant admis-
sions priority to students between the ages of 17-24 
and exclude out-of-state undergraduates entirely to 
maximize space for local, college-aged enrollment. 

Breneman stated that the exclusion of demographic 
groups is necessary to confront the huge influx of the 
17-24 age group. "Most of these actions will have a 
cost for some participants in the system, but each 
involves a balancing of those costs against the greater 
social good," Breneman stated. 

In addition, Breneman recommended freezing ad-
missions in master 's degree programs in the arts and 
sciences at all CSU campuses, as well as doctoral

A.S. May Deny Cbe's Request for Financial Review Waiver 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

The Associated Student 
Council voted in an open role-
call vote not to waive the Chi 
Cafe's financial review which is 
required by the Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOV) at last 
night's Council meeting. The 
vote, which will not be final until 
Friday at 4 p.m., could require 
the Chi Cafi to pay for a review, 
which the collective ays it can-
not afford. 

In a memorandum dated Jan. 
25, the Che Collective wrote that 

"The Chi Cafe gressed $67,000 
last year, and a books review 
will cost $1 ,500 (2.25 percent of 
gross). "The memo stated that if 
the Chi followed the require-
ments of the M.O.U, it will be 
forced to in olvency. 

The collective added in the 
memo that the review require-
ment was too demanding for 
non-profit businesses. 

Bob Corlew, a Che Cafe col-
lective member and the founder 
of the General Store Co-op, said 
that if A.S. decides not to grant 
the Che a waiver "We'll be 

shocked. We ' ll be amazed that 
the student government would 
be so anti-student. I think we'll 
continue to protest." 

" It is like being in Soviet 
Russia," Corlew added, « and 
having the KG B breathing down 
your neck all the time. It just 
take all the fun out of being in 
the co-op. You're here to be a 
student, not to . understand the 
intricacies of businc ."

Armchair Astronauts 
Race to the Moon 
SPACE: Symposium features computer programs 
which bring the 'final frontier' within reach 
By Ben Eleln

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldren 
trained extensively for years to stake 
their claim as the only humans to set 
foot on the moon. Now, armchair

computer and a modem, can navi-
gate the lunar sur-

latest software, graphic simulator 
which connects people to a rover 
within a small lunar model. The 
software allows the individual to 
steer the rover using a home com-
puter, while actual video images 
appear on the screen. Mitchell, dis-

such lunar adven-
ture, said his ulti-

Software which 
enables students to

highlights of the 
California Space 
Development Coun-
cil (CSOC) program 
held last Saturday at 
UCSD. The forum 
commemorated the

Speakers at the

Achieving the goal of affordable 
space access would require a funda-
mental change in current attitudes 
abQut space travel, said CSDC Presi-
dent David Anderman. By bringing 
together representatives from a va-
riety of space organizations, the 
council hoped to lay the foundation 
for that change. 

"We're attempting to create a 
network to realize the goals of the 
CSDC," said Anderman. 

Vanderbilt opened the meeting 
with a discussion on the progress of 
the X-33 rocket, a government-
funded project focused on creating 
a fast, light, reusable spacecraft. 
Money earmarked for its develop-
ment is in jeopardy because of gov-
ernment budget cuts. 

Vanderbilt said he believes the 
X-33 project is e~tremely impor-
tant, because improved turn-around 
time in between launches is crucial 
toward creating accessible space 
travel. 

"We're talking about building a 
new type of spacecraft that can be 
turned around in a couple of days, 
rather than a couple of months," 
said Vanderbilt.

Mitchell said that encouraging 
people to put their ideas for 
moonscapes on-line is good way to 
visualize moon colonization. Items 
ranging from colonies to alien drag-
ons have already been added to the 
virtual landscape. 

Diaspar's biggest demand comes 
from schools, which increasingly 
use the on-line services as an educa-
tional resource. 

Mitchell said he believes that 
the Diaspar model is perfect for 
schools because of its interactive 
nature. Most on-line resources sim-
ply feed information to a passive 
viewer, he added. 

However, the program has sev-
erallimitations. It only has a single 
rovllr, which can be commanded by 
just one person at a time. 

Thesizeofthe lunar landscape is 
also limited, especially as people 
add their own creations. Diaspar is 
currently exploring ways to expand 
its lunar model, but has not yet made 
any concrete plans. 

"This could get the ball rolling 
where you can actually do some-
thing on the Internet," said Mitchell. 
"This is personal participation in 
space. You can become a telenaut."

he wrote that undergraduate educa-

Software Engineer 

Naomi Falk, theA.s. representa-
tive to the University of California 
Student Association, said that gut-
ting graduate studies would under-
mine the UC's prestige. 

" UCs have earned a lot of their 
respect through undergraduate and 
graduate education. Graduate re-
search has benefiled the colleges 
and their communities," she said. 

Graduate Studenl A ssociation 
(GSA) member Paul Eykamp said 
that shutting down graduate pro-
grams would be extremely ineffi-
cient. 

" It would be a waste of tax-pay-
ers' money to dispense with all of 
them," said Eykamp.

"I imagine if you closed all of 
[the graduate programs), you would 
open up maybe a couple thousand 
undergraduate spaces," Eykamp 
added. 

Though the California Post-
secondary Education Commission 
(CPEC), the planning body of higher 
education, does not endorse 
Breneman 's proposals,press liaison 
Daniel Parker agreed with the 
necess ity of increased dialogue. 

"This is not the kind of problem

Remembering Auschwitz Is 
Warning for the Future . 

"The train stopped .... Footsteps crunched on the gravel outside 
and the big door slid open. I raised my head to look out. A soldier 
with a machine gun climbed into the wagon and began kicking the 
bodies nearest [to] him .... In the glare of a floodlight, I saw a gate 
and above it a sign! 'Arbeit Macht Frei' - 'Work Makes Free.'" 
This is how David Faber, a Holocaust survivor who lives in San 
Diego, remembers first arriving at Auschwitz. Faber is among the 
few who are still alive to tell their tales of the horrors which ensued 
at this Nazi death camp. Auschwitz was one of many among the 
Third Reich's concentration camps, where Jews and others were 
slain in mass numbers in gas chambers and crematoriums. Last 
Friday marked the 50th anniversary of the Soviet liberation of 
Auschwitz. 

Many people today look upon the Holocaust as an unfortunate 
event, but one whose significance has waned with time. However, 
we must not forget. Instead, we must take a closer look at the facts 
surrounding Auschwitz and the other camps. We need to empha-
size to the rest of the world that another Holocaust could happen. 

Six million Jews were killed during the Holocaust - approxi-
mately 800,000 at Auschwitz alone. By the time Auschwitz was 
liberated, so many Jews had been "eliminated," that there was 
scarcely a Jewish family to be found in all of Europe. Adolph 
Hitler's · "final solution" to the "Jewish problem" was almost 
realized. However, this was not just anti-Semitism; the Nazis hated 
and killed anyone who did not fit the" Aryan" mold: Over two 
million non-Jews, such as Gypsies, Catholics, prisoners of war and 
homosexuals were systematically executed during this time. The 
Holocaust proved that mass hatred and genocide is possible 
anywhere, even in the most "civilized" of nations. 

Incredibly, many people, including U.S. citizens, don't even 
know what Auschwitz is; and many are doubtful that it even 
happened. Some believe- that the thousands of artifacts and docu-
ments, collected and displayed at places such as the Holocaust 
Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
in Los Angeles, are fake or simply do not exist. Some even believe 
that the Holocaust is merely a hoax created by Jews. 

Sadly, the survivors will not be around much longer to remind 
us that what happened 50 years ago must not ever happen again. 

The Holocaust should be included in every history book in 
every school in the nation. Auschwitz should not be a foreign name 
which only Jews recognize. Each of us must realize that such an 
atrocity could happen anywhere, anytime. We cannot assume that 
the United States is such an enlightened country that it would never 
allow such horrors to reoccur. Hatred and fear have prevailed far 
too often in our history. We have an obligation to remember 
Auschwitz and to educate those who do not. 

Don't Let the Regents Rip 
The Shirt Off Your Back 

When the UC regents announced that fee increases were likely 
to continue until the year 2000, it seemed that most students simply 
shrugged, or perhaps muttered a foul word or two, and went along 
with their day. Ironically, eight years of back-to-back fee hikes-
the veritable trashing of the UC Master Plan - seem to have only 
made us more passive and complacent. 

The UC Students Association (UCSA), however, hopes to 
change this. Working in conjunction with A.S. governments at all 
nine UC campuses, the UCSA is kicking off a week-long student 
"shirt drive" to symbolize how ·the "UC regents are ripping the 
shirts off the students' backs." Through Feb. 7, the A.S. will collect 
T-shirts at the Price Center and the Hump (from 11 a.m.·2:30 
p.m.), and on Feb. 8, it will throw a shirt-signing party at the Price 
Center Plaza, in which students will have the opportunity to scribe 
personal messages to the VC's most eminent officials. . 

But this is only preparation for the big event. On Feb. 16, when 
the UC Board of Regents is slated to meet at UCSD to vote on fee 
hikes, organizers will hold a press conference and present the 
regents with the shirts. The A.S. is even considering building a 
"tent city" - replete with entertainment - to give UCSD the 
appropriate impoverished-refugee feel. 

While such a demonstration won't scare the regents or the 
governor into freezing fee hikes or allocating more money to the 
UC budget, it could certainly send a strong message - if students 
get involved.

ACADEMIA, How SILLY 
ART THY TEXTS 

COMMENTARY: Pompous political scientists confuse, rather than 
educate, readers with pretentious academic jargon 

By Jenny Unci 
Staff Writer 

Graduate school is definitely teaching me the inner 
workings of academia. After reading several hundred 
pages of academic text every week, one gets a feel for 
how these things are written. Political science texts, in 
which I am currently immersed, have their own 
formulas. 

vocabulary. First, one must repeatedly use the word 
"paradigm" in every piece, regardless of the topic. I 
envision editors at Cambridge University Press 
searching through the political-science articles with 
their blue pencils, frowning when they don't find the 
word "paradigm" and inserting it into several 
paragraphs of the text. One author of a piece I recently 
read defined "paradigm" for us as "a theory about a 

Political scientists who sit down to 
write a work have specific rules to 
follow. I'm not sure where they learn 
these rules; maybe there's a secret 
meeting after they 're bedecked in their 
PhD robes, during which the faculty 
sits the young professors down and 
informs them of the code. The most 
important rule when writing 
something is to quickly justify to your 
readers why the topic of your article is 
necessary, and why you are qualified 
to write it. 

Apparently, the way to establish 
this is to systematically destroy the 
previous work of all your colleagues. 
This dismissal is always conducted 
in contritely genteel wording, as if 
the scholar really regrets, but is forced 
out of loyalty to academic integrity, 
to expose the unfortunate fact that his 
colleague is a chowderhead. 
Something like "Jones' work, while 
revealing in the area of mu Itilateral 
Ubiquity, fails to address the key topic 
of transgovernmental platitudes." In 
such politely worded dismissals, 
authors destroy the life work of 
brilliant theorists from whom they 
probably took classes as undergrads. 
Sometimes, however, an author 
chooses to abandon polite convention 
and openly mocks what he or she 
considers to be an absurd conclusion. 
This undoubtedly leads to a 
controversy which lights up

theory." This seemed to be written to 
deliberately mess with the heads of 
weary grad students who were 
skimming the article at 2 a.m. (Not that 
I was.) 

Aside from "paradigm," another 
mandatory pol i-sci word is "fungible." 
I found this word in several texts for 
several classes, and never bothered to 
look it up in the dictionary, because I 
just always assumed it had something 
to do with mushrooms. A more recent 
addition to the poli-sci vocabulary list 
is "robust." For example, "Jones 
presents a robust analysis, but neglects 
the influences of fungible paradigms, 
so it behooves me to annihilate his 
argument in the most humiliating 
manner possible." 

Though political scientists are 
mandated by the Political Science Oath 
of Office to use the mandatory 
vocabulary, their ultimate aim in every 
article is to invent a buzzword. That is, 
they often make up their own terms in 
the hope that the rest of the academic 
world will catch on. The object is to 
make up somethi ng I ike "transcendental 
lugubriousness" and define it as vaguely 
as possible, so that graduate students 
will read it, become frustrated, drop out 
of school and never finish the 
dissertation which would allow them to 
join the academic world in which they 
could someday bash your work. Once 
you invent this buzzword, if some other 

intercollegiate e-mail for weeks on end. I would think 
it would also lead to escalation; if I were the one 
bashed, you better believe I 'd resolve to bash the other 
guy in my next article. 

scholar thinks it's a cool term and uses it in one of his 
works, that person has to credit you. For example, "as 
Lind argues with her theory of transcendental 
lugubriousness." I must admit, however, that the 

Political science texts also have mandatory . See BUZZWORD, Page 7

JOSEPH WATSON ON 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

EdItor: 
I am pleased to respond to Araceli 

Garcia's letter (" An Open Letter To 
Dr. Joseph Watson," Jan 26). 

I bel ieve that progress has been 
made under affirmative action and 
that consid'erabl y greater and faster 
progress could be made ifthere were 
the commitment and support to do 
so. I am also of the belief that the 
progress achieved to date is 
inadequate and unacceptable, both 
with respect to the extent and rate of 
progress; and that greater vigor and 
new strategies are now needed. 
Although many examples of 
inadequate progress can be given, I 
will give just three: 

• The UC eligibility rates of 
African American and Chicano/ 
Latino high school graduates 
continue to be approximately one· 
third that of white high school 
graduates and one-fifth that of Asian 
high school graduates. 

• African Americans and 
Chicano/Latinos comprise just 2.5 
percent and 5.4 percent,

You ask what act ions I have taken 
to achieve greater progress. I was 
involved in the establishment of 
Marshall College and many of its 
programs. These include Academic 
Enrichment and Opportunities 
Abroad programs and the financial 
aid policy. I have also involved 
myself in advocating the increase of 
undergraduate enrollment and in a 
new cooperative initiative to assist 
San Diego area students for 
competitive admissions to UCSD 
and other universities. 

Although I do not believe any of 
these actions will "solve the 
problem," they dO assist in providing 
more students like yourself with the 
opportunity to attend and graduate 
from UCSD with excellent post-
baccalaureate opportunities.

ASSAULT: 
Residents urged to 
be aware of their 
surroundings 
Continued from pa.e 1 

2MFP959. 
The suspect is described as a 

white male in his late 20's, approxi-
mately six feettall, of medium build, 
160-170 pounds, brown hair and 
clean shaven. 

According to Sgt. Joe Molinoski 
of the Sex Crimes Unit, this case 
may be related to another hot-prowl 
burglary which took place on Jan. 
21, but which was not a sexual as-
sault. Though the descriptions of 
the suspects vary, other aspects of 
the case are similar enough to war-
rant investigation, said Molinoski. 
"At this point, there is not enough 
information to rule in or rule out the 
possibility [that the two crimes are 
related). " 

Lt. GIenn Breitenstein of the San 
Diego Police Department said that 
to protect themselves, people need 
to be aware of their surroundings 
and be especially careful when open-
ing the door to a stranger. "Take the 
same precautions that you normally 
would, like dead bolts and chains, 
and then make sure that when you 
do open the door to someone you 
don't know that you know for sure 
what they want." Anyone who has 
additional information about this 
case is urged to call the San Diego 
Sex Crimes Unit at 531-2325. 

eRE: Cost of 
review may be 
covered by co-ops 
Continued from p". 1 
other co-ops to help them pay for it. 
"But it isjust such a waste of money, " 
he said. 

The Che Cafe has been closed as 
a restaurant since Jan. 9, citing 
"shortages in labor and money." 
However, the co-op it is still provid-
ing sandwiches for the Food Co-op 
and cookies for the General Store 
Co-op. 

A.S. President Carla Tesak wrote 
in a memo dated Feb. 1 that she had 
contacted the A.S. attorney, John 
Francis, who strongly recommended 
against waiving the review require-
ment. 

"By not following the MOU-
which is a legall y binding contract-
we could be considered negligent. If 
we are considered legally negligent 
in our following of the M.O.U, it 
could possibly negate any protec-

, tion it currently provides. This means 
that we would no longer be liable for 
only utilities, but greatly increases 
our chances for being liable for any 
and all debts the co-op may have," 
Tesak wrote, regarding advice from 
Francis. 

"I think it wouldbeashameifthe 
A.S. and the Che can 't come to 
some sort of agreement," Naomi 
Falk, the A.S. representative to the 
University of California Student 
Association said. "[The Chc] pro-
vides a lot of valuable services to 
the students." 

If the Che is unable to provide a 
required review, the Co-op Over-
sight Committee will vote on Feb. 
10 whether to recommend to A.S. to 
discontinue the MOU with the Che. 
Then the Che would have to negoti-
ate with the university for insur-
ance, rent, utilities and other operat-
ing requirements.

BOLTED: Afan 
mourns the loss 
Continued from .... 12 
such. I forgot Steve Young and Jerry 
Rice and Ricky Watters and, well, 
you get the picture. They turned my 
dream into a nightmare and sent Ted 
Leitner to the showers. 

I wailed and gnashed my teeth. I 
cried and screamed. Midway 
through the first quarter, I wisely 
moved the dumbbell sitting at my 
feet far, far away. Even in one's fits 
of rage, one wouldn't want to throw 
30 pounds of dense weight at one's 
4ger fan roommate. Of course, that 
smug look on his face was begging 
to be smashed away, but if I did 
away with him, I would never be 
able to cat his Wheaties again. 

The Niners played the wicked 
stepmother to the Chargers ' 
Cinderella, but it's not yet midnight: 
I don't see no pumpkins. In other 
words, it ain't over 'til it 's over. 

The AFC championship was an 
amazing accomplishment for this 
Charger team, more amazing than 
the sight of Alfred Pupunu 's touch-
down jig or whatever that is that he 
does. And despite what everyone 
east, north, south and west of San 
Diego said, they did have a chance 
- in my case a $75 return and a 
six-pack of Molson Golden chance 
- to win it all. 

Sure, they lost that chance. Sure, 
the Niners' took it and stomped on 
it for a few hours befo re letting 
Deion Sanders tum it into his ego's 
dance floor. And sure, the city of 
San Diego is quickly returning to its 
normal, apathetic self. 

But the Charger team which was 
entirely outclassed last Sunday is 
also the NFL's yourigest team. 
Dropped passes? Senseless offsides 
penalties? Blame it on nerves and 
the big game pressure. I say, chalk 
up this loss as much-needed expe-
rience and see what they can do next 
year. 

Boss Ross did some amazing 
things at halftime against the Chiefs 
and Jets, the Dolphins and Steelers. 
Just try to imagine what he can do 
to refocus this team in an entire off-
season. In fact, he's probably al-
ready devising his plans to tum the 
Chargers into the nextAFC dynasty. 

But please, Bobby, whatever you 
do, don't create another Buffalo. 

Walk on the 
wild side.

More Wheaties 
Next Time 

I still don 't know what went 
wrong. I remembered to eat 
my Wheaties, not only on 
Sunday morning, mind you, 
but on Saturday night, too. 
(fruth be told, I had no other 
food, but fate never inquires 
about such details.) 

I didn't shave either, which 
is always a key to good fortune 
in these situations. I even had 
my lucky boxer shorts on that 
woeful day. I had so many 
lucky charms in my corner that 
it seemed as if I were in the 
winner's circle of the Triple 
Crown. It was a veritable 
trifeeta and my confidence in 
the Bolt was at a three-week 
high. 

As penance for doubting 
them against the Dolphins and 
Steelers - who are still 
polishing up their Super Bowl 
video, I hear - I even placed a 
whopping $l5 on my boys in 
the blue and gold. And this 
was from a guy who broke into 
a cold sweat at the $2 black-
jack tables in Vegas. 

But that 's not all. I had 
indubitable proof that fate was 
smiling on my team. You see, I 
had a dream. On Saturday 
night, less than 12 hours before 
the Dorito Bowl, it came to 
me. It wasn't anything so 
simple and common as a Seau 
sack, fumble recovery and 
touchdown; a Humphries-to-
Seay bomb; or even a 9O-yard 
Andre Coleman kickoff return. 

No, it was grand. It was 
awesome. It was Ted Leitner. 
Fortunately, you don't hear 
anything in dreams, so I didn't 
have to endure his endless, 
obnoxious chatter in that 
serene twilight hour. Instead, 
he was a silent, beautiful sight. 
He was jumping up and down 
on the Charger sideline, and 
his face was lit up like a -
dare I say it? -like a great, 
big lightning bolt. 

Leitner's hardly been one of 
the Bolt's biggest fans this 
season, but such unbridled joy 
could only mean one thing, my 
slumbering mind surmised. It 
meant that Junior Seau would 
soon be strolling arm and arm 
with Mickey Mouse through 
the cherished domain of 
Disneyland. It meant that 
young Natrone Means would 
catch the next flight home to 
show Mom his new Super 
Bowl ring. 

Sadly, I forgot a few things 
in all this pre-game dreaming 

The UCSD Guardian 

Chuck Nguyen/ Guardian 
Triton goalkeeper, Mark Novem, tallied 40 saves In a 6-2 defeat at the hands of USC: 

Ice Hockey 

The UCSD pucksters (2-8) had been enjoy-
ing their longest winning streak (two games) of 
the season coming into a match-up with a hard-
nosed squad from USC last Saturday night. 

However, with two key defensivemen out 
with injuries and a third going down during the 
contest, the Tritons' baltered "D" couldn't hold 
out much longer. 

The Trojans took full advantage of UCSD's 
depleted squad, inundating Triton netminder 
Mark Novem with 46 shots. 

Novem was up to the task for the most part; 
however, USC managed to poke a number of 
rebounds past the busy goalkeeper en route to a 
6-2 triumph. 

The contest was plagued by penalties (90 
minutes total) as both teams had at least one 
player in the penalty box for almost the entire 

game. 
At one point, the referees threatened to force 

incarcerated players into the stands when the 
boxes at the M ira Mesa arena reached a near ca-
pacity of six players. 

"It was an ugly game," team captain Mark 
Schwartz said. "They were a good team, but it 
wasn't a good game." 

Despite the rough play, the Tritons were in the 
game early on. UCSD scored first, taking a 1-0 
lead when Mark Saiderman blasted the puck past 
the Trojans on an assist from Brian Dunbar in the 
first period. 

However, USC retaliated with a pair of power-
play goals to take a 2-1 lead at the close of the 
first stanza. 

The Trojans continued to take advantage of 
their man-up situations tallying two more goals 

in the second period, the lat-
ter of which, a back breaker, 
came with a mere 25 sec-
onds remaining on the clock. 

The Tritons, meanwhile, 
were unable to score when

Rugby 
As almost any coach will tell you, open-

ing a season with a big victory is the most 
you ean ask for. That is just what the UCSD 
rugby team did on Saturday, pummeling the 
visiting Pepperdine Waves, 45-0, at Warren 
West Field. 

The blowout win enabled Triton co-
coaches Mark Stensen and Eric Takeuchi to 
insert younger players in game situations -
an ex~ellent opportunity for the newcomers 
to gain valuable experience. 

The big margin also was the perfect rem-
edy, allowing several banged-up starters to 
relax on the sidelines, rather than to risk in-
jury by playing in a close match. 

UCSD (l-O) completely controlled the 
match from the outset. This Triton team 
dominance was mainly due to the numerous 
veterans making a return from the trainer's 
table to the starting lineup. 

Devon Shea 's aggressive play led the 
young UCSD squad throughout the contest. 
The team captain tallied two tries and con-
verted a remarkable five of seven extra 
points, a total of 20 points overall. 

Shea's effort was aided by teammate Mark 
Bazzet, who added two tries in the match to 
bury the guests from Malibu. Ryan Kent also 
chalked up a standout performance, playing 
strongly at flanker to complete the rout of 
Pepperdine. 

"We controlled the ball for most of the 
game and made few mistakes ... There is still 
room for improvement, but overall it was a 
good start. We need to keep working to get 
better," Takeuchi said. 

The victory puts UCSD in the thick of the 
chase for a league title, a goal the Tritons take 
very seriously. With no post-season playoffs 
or tournaments to look forward to, a league 
championship would be the pinnacle accom-
plishment for UCSD rugby. 

Tough matches against traditional power 
houses such as Loyola Marymount and USC 
loom ahead in the Tritons' future. The team 
takes its show on the road this Saturday, trav-
eling up to .Claremont to try for two in a row.

Sailing 

It was a sailor's worst nightmare: no wind. 
But that didn 't faze the UCSD sailing team 

at last weekend 's South Series I and II re-
gatta in Santa Barbara. 

"The weather was super nice, but the 
winds were light to dying," boateaptain Greg 
Korn said. "We had to use the swells to move 
us along." 

The experienced Triton squad maneu-
vered around several big-time Division I 
schools - including UCLA, San Diego State 
and UC Irvine - to finish mid-fleet overall. 

Due to surprisingly calm weather, each 
day of the weekend event was able to hold 
five full races of 15-17 boat entries. 

The UCSD "A" boat of Korn and Jamie 
Trinh fared well on the open-sea course, 
while the Triton WB" boat of Josh Feldman 
and Erica Sellin also performed admirably. 

"We're looking forward to the [Pacific 
Coast Championships]," Korn said. "We have 
a lot of confidence that we can make it."

Saxophonist David Murray highlights month-long celebration 

To celebrate Black History Month, UCSD's Contem-
porary Black Arts Program will sponsor A Calendar of

various artists. 

"In honor of Black History Month, we are hosting

UCSD community to the contribution made to society by 
African Americans," said program assistant Kim 
Coleman, who is helping to coordinate and finalize the 
events. 

The Contemporary Black Arts Program is a interdis-
ciplinary minor at Thurgood Marshall College which 
offers a combination of lecture and studio courses on 
African-American performing arts. The program was 
created to promote students' cultural awarenss, satisfy 
course requirements and serve as support for the local 
black community. 

A Calendar of Color program will kick off with lenor

drummer Andrew CyriUe and bassist Fred Hopkins) at 3 
p.m. on Friday at Mandeville Recital Hall. Murray, a 

prolific musician who has recorded over 160 albums, has 
been praised by the Village Voice for producing one of the 
best jazz albums of 1993. Known for his passionate 
performances, Murray has the power to entice and en-
trance. His recent accomplishments have included win-
ning the "Rex Award," sponsored by The Grateful Dead, 
as well as being voted "Musician of the Year"by Newsday.

Throwing Muses' off-kilter har-
monies have always been a bit too 
avant-garde for most listeners. Formed 
in Rhode Island in 1984, the band, 
which initially included vocalist-gui-
taristTanya Donnelly (who has since 
left to form Bell y), recorded a number 
of provocative albums during the late 
'80s. Vocalist-guitarist Kristen Hersh, 
who released a solo album last year, 
and drummer David Narcizo are all 
that's left of the original quartet. New 
bassist Bernard Georges(formerly the 
band's roadie) rounds out what is now 
a trio. University shows thatthe Muses 
can still produce inspired music. 

"No Way in Hell" and "[ think [ have 
a fear of him, I'm afraid of meaning 
nothing again" in "Teller." Yet the 
songs provide glimpses of psycho-
logical trauma few artists are willing 
to exposc. In tracks like "Fever Few" 
and "Bright Yellow Gun," intoxica-
tion is represented as the only respite 
for a life that fails to provide meaning. 
Images of drowning and death domi-
nate, and even Hersh's child contrib-
utes to the mix, providing a chilling 
murmur in the opening of the title 
track. The band's musical pastiches 
and Hersh's unique vocal delivery 
make University liveupto the Muses' 
past efforts.
