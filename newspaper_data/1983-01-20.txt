Letters to the Editor 

Stoners: subconsciously aware 
Editor: 

Stoner~ throughout Califor· 
nia have become either 
consciously, su bconsciously, 
or ullconsciously aware of the 
new paraphernalia law 
diffusing through Congress.1t 
wou ld mean the end of head 
shops as we know them. The 
implications are enormous. 

To begin with, what about 
the unem ployment situation? 
What could the California 
Congress gain by putting more 
stoners in the unemploymenl 
lines? [ mean, a job in a head 
shop gives a perfect example of 
employing the unemployable. 

I am reminded of my high 
<;('hool prom night. \\'alkmg

me, a \ l'ritable \ 1~I()n of whIte, 
and musl have I houghl me to 
be some kind of angel because 
he sold me a pIpe marked tcn 
dollars for jusl three. Where 
ebe could I hi.... man be

Ihing wrapped in them. . 

Let us look even deeper al 
the implicat IOn'i of I he 
paraphernalia law . What 
about ceramics clas5es? They 
would have to be canceled. 
Ho\\ many of you sloners ha\ e 
gone through an ent irequarter

I don't know how I feel about 
this new law. I mean the 
Uniled States has a terrible 
drug problem. II owever. what 
doctor prescribes a cure for a 
symptom and not the disease?

A bad year ... 
continued rrom page 3 
went to sleep on the edge of the 
field, He folded his arms over 
his chest, crossed in 
morluarial repose, making the 
undertaker's job that much 
easier. This was his dramatic 
statement. "I am here." he 
probably said, in druggish 
delirium, "but I am dead ." 

And he dead, when, the next 
morning. a jogger pas ed him 
by; thinking he wa. re ting or 
thinking. The man's pose, or 
the dew on his face and clothes 
bothered the jogger. for on hi~ 
next lap around. he stopped to 
look, then to call out. then to 
shake him, By then the body 
was very pale, and probably 
stiff and no longer only corpse-
ltke, It was just a corp e, a 
trau rna to its mot her, a shock 
to t he jogger, a delay for the 
lawn mower man, a feast for 
the ants, Just a corpse, 

I don't recall the details of 
the third suicide. I may be 
imagining it. There was a 
woman who ran away, 
though, She was also a grad 
student. he di~appeared, and 
a couple of days later , 
"omebody noticed, Maybe it 
was her students whose 
<;ection she hadn't shown up 
for, or maybe It was her 
boyfriend, The) found her 
after a week or so, though. She 
made too many misl akes. 
Withdrew mone\' from her 
account. cashed checks, drove 
t he same car, The\' tracked her 
do\\'n in Oregon, She probably 
\\'anted to be found, A n\Wa\, 

~he didn't make good on her 
escape, ~o ~pe lo~t the game, 
turned in her little tll1 doggy 
and all her iake mone, and 
finished c1as~. . 

At least shf''s not dead, like 
Tn-e Tree didn't \\ant to die, 
he dldn't \\ ant to run away, hp

trying to adapt to a lillie world 
which wou ldn't grow up to 
him, 1 remember the first time 
I saw him WI ap his hands 
around a volleyba ll , seemingly 
s~rinking it down to soft ball 
size. 

When Tree was younger, all 
of his bones and mucles 
managed to grow at the rate 
hi hormone wanted . But 
tender thing '. like hearts and 
kidneys, didn·t. Nitrous OXIde 
is an anest het ic, bad for heart s 
like all anesthetics, Bad for 
Tree, He had a heart attack. 
slumped over, while inhaling 
nitrous. The LJCSD Police 
interrupted a student giving 
CPR to carr} Tree down four 
flights of stairs and put him in 
a van, not an ambulance. but a 
van. for God sakes, Tree died, 
of course. 

Lesson #1. Never interrupt 
CPR, Anybody with any CPR 
knowledge at all knows that. 
But not the UCSD Police. 

Everybody wanted to escape

Letters to the Editor 

Muir held a trivial trivia contest 
Editor: 

We . the "Enlightened 
Despots" of B·house, are 
thoroughly appalled at the 
manner in which the Muir 
trivia contest was held, The 
organizers appeared compo 
letely ignorant of the proper 
testing of trivia knowledge, 
The questions were, for the 
most part, far too easy. and 
without a proper buzzing 
system, the so·called trivia 
contest was turned into a hand 
raising speed test. 

Four judges tried to keep 
track of twenty,eight 
contestants, and at one point, a 
split decision as to who had 
raised their hand occured. 
whereupon one team was 
randomly given the right to 
respond, There should have 
been an elimination system in 
which the teams competed in 
pairs, With all teams 
compet ing at once. a si t uat ion 
of complete anarchy was 
created, 

Furthermore, c hoi ce of 

quest ions was horrIfic, 
consisting almost entirely of 
cartoons and baseball. and 
ignoring such noble subject s 
as geography, music , 
presidents, and, of course. 
sCIence! With great indigna· 
tion we subjected ourseh'es to 
thi s s hameful excuse for a 
tri\'ia contest. At least there 
could have been a prize for best 
costume,

$12 per quarter fee will be 
rai sed to meet ri s ing 
maintenance costs during the 
fee's 30·year life. And -
should the facility not have 
fallen into total disuse during 
this period - it is certain that 
a new fee would be instituted 
to contll1ue funding t he center 
after the expiration date of the 
$12 fee, The bulkofthis money 
will go to pay the lJC Regents 
close to market rates on a loan 
they issued to build the facility 
(doubtless. the Regents will 
1I1\'t'st their handsome profits 

in such socia lly worth\' 
prujects as incresecJ inve ·r· 
ments in raci ~t Sout h Afnca). 

This facilitv - and. more 
import antly. t'he fee to pay for 
it - was rammed down 
students' throats by the 
administrat ion wit hout regard 
for the effects that stead il y 
increasing fees have upon the 
ability of poor and minority 
s tudent s to attend the 
University; and no attention 
was given to the IXlssible 
alternat ive uses t hat such 
funds, if they must be 
collected, might' be u~ed for 

(suc h as establishing 
cooiJerat ive housing, to cIte 
just one example), 

We would all do well to look 
at the history of how the 
recreation facility was 
developed and shoved down 
students throats (t hrough four 
consecut iv e referenda). and 
begin to develop strategies for 
ensuring that studenls gain 
control o\'er st udent fees: to 
begin to fight for the right to 
make ourselves the decisions 
that affect us,

MEXICO 
continued from page 1 
econom ic hou es in order 
cou ld plunge the borrowers 
into deep reee ·sion." 

In a nut hell. Mexico's 
current economic cri~is 
re ulted from the government 
embarking on a massive and 
expen . lve development 
crusade. based on 0\ erlv 
optimistic otl revenue 
projections. C o rnelius 
summed it up In two short 
phrases: "MeXICO had been 
It\ ing beyond its mean~." and 
·· ... government planners 
mo\t~ too far too fast." 

lIpon his electIOn. PreSident 
De la Madrid. in order to deal 
with the economic crtsis. 
implemented certain meas-
ures designed to bring the 
economy back under control. 

ome of the more important 
ones were: 

- The dismantling of the 
currency exchange controls 
implemented by the Lopez 
Portillo administration and 
the e tablishment of a free 
market exchange rate. The 
administration hope this will 
eliminate the black market 
competition for American 
dollars, hard currency that the 
government drastically needs 
in order to pay the foreign 
debt ; 

- The liftingof government 
price controls on 4.700 of the 
5. 0 or ' 0 commodltle. under 
government control. Thl~ was 
welcomed by the pri\ate 
business sector because of the 
prtce advantages subSidies 
gave to s tate-ow ntxl busines-
ses: 

- A 15 percent increase in 
the Value Added Tax . a form of 
sale~ tax that accounts for 
slightly under half of all 
government tax re\enues . 
This was done in lteu of 
raising per'-,onal and corporate 
income taxes: 

- A con'>tltutional 
amendment '>tatlng that 
MexIco will mamtain a "mixed 
economy," ensuring that parts 
of the economic sphere Will be 
resen cd '>peciflcally for 
pri\'atc enterprise. CorneltUS 
poinh out that thl'> amend-
ment dre\\ strong criticism 
from :\lexico's polttical left 
becau'>e It \-Irtuall\' closed the 
dIKJr on any chance for the 

Mexican economy to become 
purely ocialist in nature. 

In addition to these legal 
mea ·ure • . one non-legislative 
and controversial action taken 
by the government asked Its 
foreign creditors (some 1.400) 
to change Mexico's "short-
term" debt s into "medium 
term" debts. This would allo\\ 
Mexico to pay the int erest on 
those debts due bet\\een 19 2 
and 1984 (some 20 billion) 
over a period of eight years. 
with a four year grace pellod. 

The contr()Ver~v lies in 
asking for the "short term" 
debts to be changed to 
"medIum term ." effectiveh 
asking for a moratorium on 
paying its debts. So far. foreign 
banks have given the Mexican 
government a moratorium on 
its debt ince August of last 
year and the cou ntry has not 
paid its cred itors since that 
time. Some financial analy ts 
believe that uch morator-
iums. in the long run. could be 
detrimental. 

One analyst wa quoted in 
Busi'less Ii-'eek a stating. 
"The most unnerving scenario 
i that of major debtors 
declaring a moratorium on 
payments. Mexico ha already 
a ked for a grace period on 
interest payments. Dimini<;h· 
ing oil revenue and worsening 
poverty could yet prompt its 
leader. orne obseryers fear . 
to apply the moratortum 
solution to it s entire debt 
load ." 

If Mexico \\ ere to declare 
that it I..\'as not going to pay 
back its loans (although thIS is 
unlikely), man) fear the $8:~ 
billion lost would thro\\ the 
\\ orld into a severe depression. 
much like t he one of the 19:30s. 

Those concerned WIth 
l\lexlco's economIC stablht) 
have expressed concern about 
how that economIc stablht, 
will affect th e cou ntry 's 
politIcal stability . There has 
been wide dIscussion as to 
whether economic conditions 
wi ll get so bad as to \\ arrant a 
possible take-o\er bv the 
milttary. . 

Corneltus expressed the 
\Ie'\, that Mexico IS still"very 
far" from a mllttarv take·over. 
He believes that for a mIlitary

Guardian Sports Line 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

laft Wri ler 

Instead of proclaiming my 
predictions for the upcoming 
year (after all a prediclion is 
something one thinks mIght 
happen), I will now tell all that 
is going to happen in t he sports 
world in the year] 983. 

- Steve Garvey will hit .320 
in the first two month of the 
baseball season, and then 
lump the rest of the way, 

winding up at .260 with 12 
homers and 69 runs batted in. 

- In turn, the Padres will 
start off strong, lose ten in a 
row , at which time Manager 
Dick Williams will say he has 
been too tough on the young 
lads and will ease off for a 
while. San Diego will continue 
to plummet. and will fintsh 
fourth behind the Giants, 
Braves, and Dodgers. Upon the 
season's conclusion, Williams 
will tate that if he wasn't so 
oft during t he Padre " 

downfall, they wouldn't ha\'e 
finished where they did. 

- Williams, who called an 
Diego Union Sports Editor 
Barry Lorge a "chicken .... " 
when Lorge ran a column last 
ummer criticizing the San 

Diego manager, will apologize 
during Spring Training, only 
to call him an .... hole" so 
eloquent ly the minute Lorge 
criticizes Williams' strategical 
decisions. 

- Ted Giannotllas, better 
known as the San Diego 
Chicken, will sell out all 16 
contehts in which he is 
scheduled to appear in this 
'eason, and oon t hereaftf'r 
Padres President Ballard 
Smith will sign him to a six· 
year, nine·million·dollar no· 
cut contract with an 
attendance clause, making 
him the highest paid Padre. 

- Ralderh owner AI Davis 
will hhock the sports world by 
announcing that he is moving 
the club to Sioux City, Iowa to 
capitalize on the growing cable 
teleVision market. In addition, 
Davis will say "he loves the 
fans of Los Angeles but was 
forced mto the move," 

- Chargers quarterback 
Dan Fouts, who sets NFL 
passing records as often as 
Ronald Reagan goes on 
\acatlon, WIll retire from pro 
foot ball over a cont ract 

di pute. Fouts will spend the 
year fish ing in Oregon, while 
San Diego wi ll trade its two 
nu mber one draft picks to 
Baltimore for the first pick in 
the draft, and then selectlohn 
Elway from Stanford. 

- The San Diego Chargers' 
hierarchy wi II take out an 
insurance policy with L10yds 
of London, so that every time 
running back Chuck Muncie 
fumble ' they will receive a 
dividend, 

- Thomas Benton of 
Charlolle, North Carolina, 
who i trying to be t he first 
person e\'er to wal k around the 
world (he said it will take him 
five years), will drown 
'ometime in September. 

- San Diego Soccer great 
Julie Veee, who playes almost 
100 games a year if you 
com bine indoor and outdoor 
schedu les, will be the vict im of

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

-Slaft Wril~r~ 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Fullll'e Scenario: 8:46 
pm Friday evening. Triton Pavilion. J ,041 packed to the rafters 
for Spirit Night . 6:42 mto the first half, Fresno PacifiC at I he line 
shooting a one-and-one. " It 's up, around the rim and off. 
MeG uire up the ladder for the rebound ... Outlet pass toGoodman 
at midcourt...Right side to FlinL..20 foot rainbow on the 
way ... GOOD!!!" Nine point Triton leae\.. Time out, Fresno 
Pacific. After the fan s settle back into their seats their is nothing 
but an eerie hus h in the crowd ... silencc .. .l-Z-Z·Z.z-Z. Where's 
the fight song? Nothing pumps a crowd up or enhances school 
spi rit more t han a fight song. On this day,January 20th, 1983, we 
officially propose a UC D fight song. We want to hear from you! 
Send your entry to RU1/llil/g Tho lights , c/o Th e Guardian, B·016, 
or drop it off at the Guardian offices. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Although the men's 
basketball team is receiving most of the publicity, it is the 
women lhal have performed eXf'ept ionally well. The Lady 
Tritons are fl yin ' high on an 11 -7 record and a four game winning 
streak. Whether it was because the student s were forced to pay a 
wlwle dollar, or they ju"t feel that women's basket ball is simply a 
ho·hum affair, only 3:i patrons found the time to show up last 
Saturday night at the Pavilion to see this class act demolish 
Whittier College by 35 points. WAKE UP! This product is good. 
Go out and buy it. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, Masochl"m loves masochIsm. 
Welcome to the "Liz and Dick" affair, Part 111. The sporting 
world's answer to Elizabet h Taylor and Richard Burton I~ Billy 
Martin and George Stelllbrenner. [n Billy's third time as the 
Yankee skipper, he has his work cut out for him. Inexpltcable 
trades, mediocre players Signing multi·million dollar contracts, 
and an abundance of talent causing fruslrated st arts to sit on the 
pine have all made the New York Yankees a catastrophe. As 
strange as it may seem, this catastrophe \',ill win the pennant. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT, Year 'round football. Fans 
have been say ing for years that they can't get enough football. 
They are bored in the spr ing months \\ hen all they have IS the 
middle of pro basketball, college hoop, hockey , and baseball's 
spring training. Enter the U nited State~ Foot ball League. The 
league opener is March 6, and ABC and E PN WIll . televise 
numerous ballgame'i. Not many people even kno\\' the diVISIOns, 
so we will gi\'e a rundown. PACIFIC - Los Angeles, Dem'er, 
Oakland, Ariwna. CENTRAL - Tampa Bay, Chicago, 
Michigan, Birmingh am. ATLANTIC - Philadelphia, Boston , 
Washington, New Jersey. If the league's owners are patient 
enough to endure two years of financial hardship, the USFL \\ III 
nouri"h. By the way, where',; San Diego's team? Ohhh that's 
fight, this isn't a f(xllball town.

The Good Humor Men 
"Video/TV:Humor/Comedy" exhibit at Mandeville 

By KOMHU 
In "Art Punks," a video performance 

piece by Ernest Gusella, the degenerate-
looking leader of a three-piece band ex-
plains in a catchy little tune that he will do 
anything for a good review. He will jump 
out of twelfth story windows, crawl through 
broken glass, drown or generally maim him-
self, just as long as he can see his name in 
print. Gusella may not do all those things 
himself. but as a director/ performer of video 
comedy, he certainly deserves the good re-
views: his pieces are hilarious. 

The same can be said of the rest of the ex-
hibit at the Mandeville Art Gallery, "Video/ 
W:Humor/Comedy," now being shown until 
January 30. There are almost eight and a 
half hours worth of video humor, organized 
by John Minkowski for Media Study/Buffalo 
with support from the National Endow-
ment for the Arts. The selection ranges 
from slapstick to sophisticated comedy, 
from. off-the-wall to downright bizarre. 
And though individual performances 
might not appeal to everyone, any view-
er who stays for an hour or so will find 
something genuinely funny 

The eight-plus hours of tapes are di-
vided into separate programs, accor-

ding to general categories. The most popular 
of these programs is the one on 
Musial/Comedy. Most of the works are short, 
from about two to eight minutes, so this is 
an especially good program for sampling a 
variety of video artists. 

The first piece on the program, "Guitar 
Piece" by Pier Marton, is two and a half 
minutes of a man smashing himself over the 
head with a guitar. When the instrument 
finally breaks, he then begins hacking at the 
little pieces, until he's left gnawing on a 
single string. "Ear to the Ground" by Kit 
Fitzgerald and John Sanborn takes a more 
positive approach ,to music: it features a 
modishly dressed man, complete with tinted 

glasses and fedora hat, playing his drum-
ticks all over the city - on telephone 
booths, on gates and doors and signposts, 
and on the sidewalks and streets. He goes 
along, drumming out intricate rhythms 
without ever missing a beat, until he finally 
goes bopping off into the sunset - a cool, 
upbeat performance if there ever was one. 

Some pieces had good music: "Selections 
from 360" by Julia Heyward, for example, or 
Twinart's "Instant This, Instant That," (Music 
by Taste Tests) which shows a set of identical 
twins going through a day of "push a button, 
processed food, turn a dial, instant mood" 
and putting Sugar Twin in their identical 
instant coffees. Followers of nouveau music 
may be familiar with the Residents, a San 
Francisco group who contribute four 
Francisco group who contibute four 
"Minute Movies": "Moisture," "Perfect 
Love," "The Act of Being Polite," and "The 
Simple Song." In laurie Anderson's " lan-
guage is a Virus," a punk-looking person 
with a dubbed-in baritone voice prom-
ises some "Difficu lt Music"; "So sit bolt 
upright in that straight-backed chair! 
Button up that top button! " Then the 
voice delivers such profound lines as

Good and bad taste highlight 
the hilarious UCSD Artfest '83 

Hy ROM HU-
There are those people who 

think that art should maintain a 
sense of humor. that art 
shouldn't be a dry, lifeless 
concept understood by a few 
elite. Then there are those who 
feel that art and humor have 
nothing in common. and that 
any attempt at satire or, God 
forbid , slapstick I is sacrilegi-
ous. Luckily, Gregory Redmond 
and Ma~orie Mowry. students at 
UCSD, belong to the former, And 
Artfest '83. for which they are 
Organizer and Chair, respectiv-
ely, is definitely not for the 
latter group. 

Artfest '83, currently showing 
at the Mandeville Annex Gallery 
(downstairs in the Mandeville 
complex). is billed in the press 
release as " the ultimate parody 
of institutional gallery shows." 
Well. Artfest may not be the 
"u ltimate" in anything, but it 
certainly is a good time. In 
addition to what was inside the 
gallery, there were jugglers, 
balloons. a wandering gorilla. 
and a huge "Space Pillow" 
trampoline for the Monday 
opening of the show. and a 
promise of classic comedy films 
after 6 p.m. These gimmicks 
enli'Jened the atmosphere. but 

Another look atArtfest 

the show in~ide stands just as 
well on it:; own. 

first. upon entering the 
gallery, each visitor is presented 
with a free sculpture of Abraham 
Uncoln (a penny). Then viewers 
are invitd to regIster to win a 
door prize (guess what? an 
actual car door) or one of 
several non-functional 
appliances. or minkS. ermine 
and beaver furs (small bits of 
each) or even a working, new 
washer and dryer (1'11 let you 
figure that one out yourselves).

bubbles In a frame is hung 
under the heading Pop Art. 
Next to that hangs Pop Art. 
the Identifying card of which 
reads, "I wouldn't eat this If I 
were you. Hetty Crocker." 

The show itself is dedicated 
to Don Diego. familiar to San 
Diego area residents as the 
rather annoying host and 
mascot of the annual Del Mar 
fair. Don stands near the 
entrance with one of the 
" fairest Of the Fair." in what the 
artists claim is not an 
uncharacteristic position, 

Juggler [dward Jackman will perform at noon friday on the plaza. 
What other people merely 

conceptualize, the 1983 
Artfest accomplishes. lbe 
question one naturally asks 
Is "Why bother7" lbls Is a 
serious. not a satirical 
questIon. The Artfesl brings 
together the finest collection 
of visual puns west or Monty 
Python. the sort of things 
which usually occur only In 
phrases. "WOuldn't It be 
hilarious If ..• ?" But Is It 
worth our money. the 
discretionary part of our fees, 
to transfer the puns from 
their highly polished form In 
the Imaginations of Gregory 
Redmond, Marjorie Mowry 
and their fellow artist-
comedians to the imperfect 
world of physical media? 

I am not going to answer 
those questions (Isn't that 
infuriating?) Instead. I shall 
tell you what I saw and heard, 
and you may love me "for the 
dangers I had p~'d." (That 
is from Othello, Chem 
students). A sheet of plastic

striking work Is a 
modernistic sculpture of a 
chicken, which at selected 
times during the day has a 
real chicken posing 
(aesthetically) on the top. 

Now you see why I did not 
want to commit myself. 
Neither did the judges. Prizes 
range from $2,00 for first 
prize to 75¢ for sixth. 

The gimmicks and puns don't 
stop in the exhibit proper either. 
"The Great Out Doors," a series 
of Iifesize painted doors - all 
labelled "Out." of course - are 
from Redmond's 1982 showing, 
and supposedly are " back by 
popular demand," Then there 
are visual puns like " Brush with 
Death on Wheels" by Redmond, 
'Typical WASP Honeymoon in 
Niagra falls " by Mowry. who 
even took the care to put one 
wasp's tiny arm around the 
other, and "Six O'clock Evening 
Nose." which no one would take 
credit for. 

Another bit of downright 
silliness are the relabelled 
soupcans: "Chicken Gumby" 
with accompanying ditty. and 
"Chicken Poodle Soup.' billed 
as "Doggone good I among 
them. 

Redmond and MOWry take a 
stab at museum groupings with 
their categorie of different 
forms of art. There ' s 
"Conceptual Art ' with its share 
of blank wall, " Lost Art, " "Found 

Art," " Pop Art" repre en ted by a 
framed bit of bubble 
encapsulated packing material. 
and ' Pop Tart · by Betty (rocker 
with the warning I wouldn't eat 
this if I were you." One of the 
funniest groups is the 
"Primitive Art" section. which 
includes a nose ornament by 
Jessops Jewelers of New Guinea, 
a debutante mask from 
Pasadena. 1979 A.Do, and a piece 
identified as Zapotec Girl 
Scout: 

The exhibit also includes 
several guest artists. only one of 
wh ich can be confirmed to be an 
actual peson, Betty Garland 
contributes about ten rather 
good black and white 
photographs. some of which are 
humorous, as the picture of two 
tennis players simultaneously 
jumping the net. and one of 
\\hich is supposedly interpret-
able as being offensi, e 
although Two Men and a 
Pelican' may not be to most 
viewers.

Music and comedy 
videos at Man. show 
oontlnued from page 1 
"I opened the door/With my 
bare hands." Very strange but 
very funny. 

There are also pieces with 
humorously awful music : "Scale 
flop" by Ernest Gusella 
lIIustrates a masochistic do-re-
mi. and " Eight Days a Week " by 
the Kipper Kids is the absolutely 
worst version of the Beatles' hit 
I ever hope to hear. Musical 
comedy can be silly, as in 
Michael Smith's "Giddi Up 
Travel Agent. " or obscure, as in 
" Songs for Swinging larvae" by 
Graeme Whifler with Renaldo 
and the Loaf, or even a little 
gross. as in Dale Hoyt's 
" Dancing Death Monsters. " 
which shows, among other 
things. hacked up chicken. 
bloody extracted teeth. and a 
small child crying " Pleasel 
Pleasel " "Song of the Street of 
the Singing Chicken" by Kenn 
Beckman is for those who find 
tight c10seups of chickens 
inherently funny. and Tony 
Oursler's "Till Ya Know Me" 
failed to get anything but 
puzzled expressions from most 
of the viewers, 

Some of the best video artists 
are represented several times in 
several categories, Mitchell 
Kriegman and William Wegman 
have appeared on " Saturday 
Night Live," so their humor is 
considered more accessible 
than some of the others. 
Wegman puts his faithul dog 
Man Ray through his paces. 
while Kriegman stars in his own 
productions. 

Kriegman's "Turkey Dinner." 
about the experience of being 
ignored In a relative's house. is 
mildly amusing. and his " Likely 

Stories," a long piece 
interspersed with shorter gags. 
is one of the best in the show, 

Besides " Giddi Up Travel 
Agent. " Michael Smith produces 
"Driving," about the rules ofthe 
road explained to a beat by the 
marvelously goofy- looking 
Smith. and "Secret Horror, " 
where the befuddled main 
character. wearing a MI K[ belt 
buckle. is confronted by a 
glowing ceiling. a talking iron. a 
constantly ringing phone, and a 
set of improbably tall. sheet-
draped spooks who ruin Mike's 
dry-cleaning, eat the chocolate 
off his bridge mix. and kidnap 
him to a stupid game show, 
Mike ends the piece by strutting 
in and out of the fallen frame of 
his suspended ceiling to the 
music of Neil Young. 

Louis Grenier and Teddy 
Dibble both have short 
programs of selected works: 
Grenier with sight gags in 
" Caught" and " Pass Debris," 
Dibble with "Secrets l'II Never 
Tell " - naturally, he never tells 
them - and "Cough," wherein a 
poor actor is commanded by a 
demanding director to produce 
everything from a "dry hack" to 
"emphysema" to "black lung," 

Another thing that "Video/ 
W: Humor/ Comedy" proves is 
that excellent videos can be 
produced on a very low budget. 
" Video Rover " by Brad 
Stensberg is a good example; in 
it, the artist treats his camera 
like an unruly dog. and we see 
the entire scene from the dog's 
point of view, 

.-c..-c.-c 

In a show ofthis quality. very 
few videos fell short of the 
others. " Lure Detour" by Will ie 

Walker, a respected video artist. 
was a little obscene and not very 
funny. the running joke having 
to do with hunting "fresh water 
mermaids" using blow-up party 
dolls as decoys. 

I was disappointed most with 
"Test Tube" by a group called 
General Idea : they start out with 
a good concept. but the piece is 
too long and relies too much on 
"in" art jokes about a 
baldheaded artist who muses 
that future generations will call 
this her " blue period." 

Revolutionary Cocktail. sipped 
through a straw from a blender 
that's still going. Perhaps the 
piece could be improved by 
shortening it (it currently lasts 
almost half an hour) or by 
cutting out some of the more 
lengthy dialogues between the 
Color Bar scientists. or by 
concentrating less on the bald 
artist. 

These flaws are few. however. 
and minor. Overall. "Video/TV : 
Humor/Comedy" is an excellent 
show. genuinely funny with 

hours. so if you have some time 
every day at the same time, you 
are likely to see different videos 
each time. 

The Mandeville Art Gallery js 
open Tuesday through Sunday. 
from noon until 5 p.m. 
Admission is free. The viewing 
seats are comfortable and there 
are programs complete with 
running times of all pieces 
(although there i1) at least one 
very funny bit called " Dancing 
Man" not covered anywhere on 
the program). In conjunction

Sundown 
Rank and file 
Slash 

If someone asked you to 
name a record that combines 
elements of rock, reggae and 
country-western. and couples 
them with a social conscience. 
you might well mention a recent 
Clash album. 

But if you were asked to name 
a record that accomplished all 
that in the sme song. you'd 
probably be stumped - and 
more than a little skeptical. 

There is indeed such a record. 
though: it's Sundown. the 
remarkable debut by Rank and 
File on Slash Records, And jf 
someone asked me to name the 
best album of 1982, I'd pick this 
one. 

Rank and File. which was 
formed in New York City and 
now makes its home in Austin, 
has some strong local roots. 
Brothers Chip and Tony Kinman. 
who share vocal chores and play 
guitar and bass respectively. 
formed an innuential punk band 
called the Oils in 1977 while 
they were living in Carlsbad. 
Gu itarist Alejandro Escovedo. 
who was in San francisco's 
Nuns. is also a one-time San 
Diego resident. while drummer 
Slim [vans is the group's token 
Texan, 

Sundown has a predominate 

country feel. but certain ly not 
what you would call a " Nashville 
sound." If anything. it harkens 
back to the music being created 
at Sun Records in Memphis 
nearly three decades ago. when 
country and blues styles were 
melded into rock and roll by the 
likes of Elvis Presley. Carl 
Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis. 
Rank and File's sound seems 
especially akin to the stripped-
down country of Sun artist 
Johnny Cash and the Tennessee 
Two. whom it salutes (along 
with Hank Williams and Letty 
Frizzell ) on the album's title 
song, 

Sundown is especially 
impressive for how unforced 
and downright fresh its music 
sounds, Rank and File 's reggae 
influences, for example. are 
assimilated almost invisibly 
into " Rank and file, " and in 
" Coyote" the instrumental 
"dub" break is startling yet 
perfectly appropriate, 

" Rank and file " and "Coyote" 
both demonstrate the extent of 
the group's social concern. 
" Rank and File" is a show of 
support for the American (hard) 
worker; it points out the painful 
injustices of "working for the 
boss. never stop(ping) to 
wonder why," but in such 
rousing fashion that it makes 
you eager to 'Join the rank and 
file. " 

"Coyote" is an evocative 

lIIembers of Rank and file -
the new roc.JGlbilly sensation 
from the great state of Texas, 

portrait of the plight of the 
illegal alien. concentrating on 
the personal rather than the 
political aspects, The song's 
intelligent lyrics are driven 
home by Chip Kinman 's 
harmonica and Tony Kinman 's 
commanding vocals, 

One last strength of 
Sundown lies with the vocal 
harmonies of the Kinman 
brothers, Tony 's strong. 
distinctive baritone and Chip's 
somewhat whiny tenor 
complement each other 
extremely well , most notably on 
the Everly Brothers -styled 
ballad " Lucky Day,"

and wit to produce a program of 
amazing sounds with the UCSD 
Extended Vocal Techniques 
Ensemble on the "Wednesday 
Evenings on Behalf of Music" 
Series. January 26 at 8 p.m. in 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

The Extended Vocal 
Techniques Ensemble was 
formed 10 years ago as an 
experimental research and 
performance group dedicated to 
developing a sonic vocabulary 
based on study of various 
musical cultures. Wednesday's 
program offers the culmination 
of their research : " Three 

Madrigals" by William Brooks, 
"Pastoral" by David Jones. " Not 
a Soul But Ourselves" by Roger 
Marsh, Harkins and larson in 
" Piece for Trumpet and Dancer" 
and " Requiem" by Deborah 
Kavash. 

The group. Deborah Kavash, 
Linda Vickerman , Edwin 
Harkins. and Philip larson. has 
been praised by contemporary 
composers and critics for 
developing a range of vocal 
musical materials previously 
unknown. demonstrating once 
more that the human throat is 
the last frontier of the musical 
avant-garde. 

Many composers. such as 

Roger Reynolds, Joji Yuasa. 
Robert t:rickson have written 
pieces expressly for [VTE. Their 
research activities include 
collaboration with theater. 
video, film and dance artists, as 
well as voice scientists and 
neuroscientists. The Ensemble 
presented concerts, lectures, 
workshops and broadcasts 
throughout Europe, Canada and 
the United States. including the 
Paris A. R.C.2 festival, the 
Bourges GMEB festival. the 
Koln festival of Contemporary 
Music. the Holland festival. and 
concerts series of New Music in 
Chicago, Toronto and 
Vancouver.

Concert Line 
Red Wedding offers 
real music to UCSD 

By JOHN Nft: 
It DAVt: fILI"IINGt:R 

It is a truly rare occasion 
when meaningful music is 
brought to our campus. So far 
this year such bands of dubious 
musical quality as the Missing 
Persons and Oingo Boingo have 
graced this school with their 
presence. 

While both shows were a 
tremendous success from an 
economic standpoint. the music 
that has been purveyed by bands 
of their like has shown little in 
terms of quality and certainly 
no true artistic motivation. It 
seems that for any band to gain 
popularity with the masses. 
certain concessions in terms of 
quality and originality must be 
made. 

• • • 
This Saturday the band Red 

Wedding will be presented in 
the Rec. Gym. The closest that 
this band could come to a 
classification would probably 
be psychedelic. Their sound is 
very new yet danceable. Having 
just completed a tour that took 
them to opening dates with 
Public Image Umited and Bow 
Wow Wow, Red Wedding has 
also managed to complete and 
E.P. which their current tour is 

promoting. 
Musically, Red Wedding 

opens new avenues of 
psychedelia . Their use of 
feedback is reminiscient of that 
used by such psychedelic 
institutions as Love and the 
Strawberry Alarm clock. Beyond 
beingjust a psychedelic revivaL 
Red Wedding integrates a 
clearly new sound into their 
music. 

Their use of keyboards gives 
their music a solid base as well 
as voicing the melodic theme. 
More importantly. Red Wedding 
does not use hooks and cliches 
found in other bands of their 
genre. By being a new band they 
enjoy the freshness of having 
true musical freedom : and 
unlike bands that have risen on 
the new wave of muzak. Red 
Wedding is not bound to the 
constraints of mainstream 
radio. 

• • • 

Overall this show could be 
the best possible thing that 
could happen to bringing good 
music to UCSD. Hopefully with 
the success of this show it will 
no longer be a neccessity to go 
off campus to enjoy good music.

UCSD hosts premiere of award-
winning _ Polish film "Constant" 

~AT THE MOVIES---

By CLYDt:Nt: N t:t: 
This campus is indeed 

fortunate to be able to host the 
San Diego Premiere of Krysztof 
Zanussi's film Constant 
(Constant factor), which won 
the Jury prize for direction at 
Cannes. The events in Poland 
duri ng the past two years have 
brought greater awareness to 
the American people of the 
problems that exist between the 
Polish people and the 
government in power. Polish 
films made by such directors as 
Andrzej Wajda and Zanussi have 

gained both critical acclaim and 
praise outside of their native 
land. and have given audiences 
a unique look at the problems 
that exist in the lives of the 
Polish people. 

Constant tells the story of a 
young man seeking to parallel 
the achievement of his father, a 
famous mountaineer. The 
barriers that keep him from 
doing so exist both within his 
own character and the society in 
which he is a part. Zanussi uses 
his subtle art of cinemato-
graphy to portray this conflict 

within his hero so well that it is 
truly a great film. 

Along with this is a look at 
the corruption that exists 
among Polish bureaucrats. and 
the inablility of various 
institutions in the state to 
provide the basic necessities 
that we take for granted to the 
Polish people. 

The film will premiere with 
English subtitles next Thursday. 
January 27. in Mandeville 
Auditorium at 8pm. Tickets are 
$2 at the University Events Box 
Office In the Student Center. 

IJ Museum to highlight "Heroines"

Baxtor, Marilyn Monroe and 
Carole Lombard. 

Davis stars in All About Eve, 
the series first film, playing a 
powerful though aging stage 
actress at the apex of her career 

who does battle with a 
calculating, treacherou~ 
newcomer played by Anne 
Baxter. Marilyn Monroe is seen 
briefly in the film in the role of 
the young protege of a waspish 
critic played by George Sanders.

this 1950 cinematic version of 
high theatre which won Oscars 
for Best Director. Best 
Screenplay. Best Picture, Best 

Supporting Actor (Sanders ).
