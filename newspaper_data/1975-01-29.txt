Co nferen ce on Raci sm on 
F bruary 14 in Boston has been 
approved· as a campu

Mike Zarote, a coordi nator fOI 
the n w group, said that the 
organization will m t today at 
1. 0 pm in the conference room 
of the Student C nter to begin 
planning for the ffort. 

Possible BRG Funding 

Zarote said that a request for

been subm i tted to the Student 

ooperarive's Budget Re~our e 
Cmup (B RC), and that he expects 
word from the BRC by February 7 

It ha been st imated that the 
trip will co t from 300 to $750, 
depending on the number of 
representatives who go and th ir 
mode of transportation . 

"We feel we have a positiv 
endorsement from the Coop," 
Zarote aid, r ferring to a me ting 
on January 20 when the con -
ference was mentioned and 
di cus ed by the membership. H e 
also aid that MECHA, a Chicano 
organization, has endorsed the 
trip. 

The conference is in response 
to violence and controversy in 
Boston over forced bussing, a 
program that has been a center of 
national attention since it began 
in September . Several thousand 
individuals participated in a 
March in Boston in the middle of 
December.

endorsed by US representatives 
Patricia Schroeder, Shirley 
Chisholm, Ronald Dellums, and 
Andrew Young, in addition to

. Luque Nearly Resigns When Coop 
Allows Lee, Moreno to Stay on BRG 

by John H. Taylor 
The Student Cooperative's Budget Resource Group (BRG) 

Monday narrowly averted losing its coordinator and two of its 
members after the Coop voted to allow the present BRG to 
operate, even though four of its eight members live in the same 
Blake HaJl uitt" 

In" flurry ot argument, motions and votes, the Coop considered for 
nearly an hour BRC coordinator Rudy Luque's complaint that BRC 
members Ale,: Nedelman, Bert Lee, Oscar Moreno and Brian . 
O'Laughlin live in the same suite in Argo Hall, a situation Luque said 
would allow for bloc voting on the BRC. The BRC recommends how 
the Coop's student activity fee money should be spent. 

Luque also complained that the four are members of a fraternity that 
had subm itted a budget request to the BRC for operation as, said a fifth 
frat member, "a social service organization ." 

The budget request was withdrawn during the meeting. 
2 Elected, 2 Appointed 

The two members the Coop has control over, Lee and Moreno, were 
elected from a field of 14 candidates at the January 20 Coop meeting. 
Nedelman , appointed by the Fourth College Council, has served since 
the beginning of the year, while O 'Laughlin was recently appointed by 
the R velie College Council , apparently with the knowledge that he 
lived with the three other memb rs . 

I nitially, Luque asked for a vote of confidence in the two members 
elected by the Coop, apparently hoping the vote would fad . He had 
to ld the Coop previously that " there has been a difference of opinion 
of the comm ittee, and that' why I'm asking for a vote of confidence.' 

The vote of confidence failed, but after more argument it was 
proposed that tn present BRC bee allowed to continue without 
restrictron, with the understanding that Luque would report any 
uspicions he had of possible bloc voting to the Coop . When that 

motion passed by a large majority, in addi BRC members 

Bert Lee, BRG member, 
the committee January 20. 
Irma Munoz and Selma Blake, left the room, indicating that they 
would resign . • 

(After the vote of confidenc~, Luque said he had called a meeting of 
the BRC Monday afternoon, at which time he said he proposed that 
the four members in question be allowed to serve on the committee if 
it were agreed that the four non-Blake members be allowed to block 
any suspected bloc action . 

(Reportedly, the four committee members in question refused the 
offer during the meeting . Luque made the offer again during the Coop 
meeting, but most Coop members opposed it.) 

After the three BRC members who said they had resigned left the 
meeting, they met outside with the other five members . Luque entered 

BRG member Oscar Moreno. Both Lee and Moreno are 
residents of the same suite, which was a pomt of controz'ers} at 
Mondav 's Coop meeting . 

[en minutes later and aid the BRC had "decided to work together, 
adding, " But If I think som thing is gOing on, I' ll come rrght back and 
tell the <Coop " 

Opposed Restrictions 
Most of the Coop members who poke eemed to oppose the notion 

that the members who live together should be restricted or removed 
Ann Carberry, a newly-e lected BRC member, said, "I'd have to be 
convi nced that there was some sort of collUSion before we could stop 
them from votrng," while Monty Reed, though ailing for a n w 
election, sai d, "We can't.condemn ongoing social int raction - it's 
going to happen in any group." 

However, Joel Balbien said, " I'm not questioning the rntegrrty of the 
members, but people outside the Coop are going to be shocked when 
they hear that four members of one of the most powerful committees 
on campus live in the same place ." 

Some Coop members seemed displeased that the Cooperative had 
not b'een informed during the election that two of the 14 candidates 
lived in the same suite. 

However, all four of the suitemates insisted that the possibility of 
being accused of either conspiracy of bloc voting had not occurred to 
them . Nedelman, who nominated Moreno for the BRC election last 
week, said he had been " interested in getting friends involved in the 
Coop," and added, " You're condemning people before they've done 
anything.l'd like to see them iudged by 'their actions and their merits ." 

" Inherent Weaknesses" 
Although Luque indicated at the end of the meeting that the BRC 

had agreed to work together, two members of the group indicated to 
the Triton Times privately that they thought the dispute Monday had 
pointed up weaknesses in both the Coop and the BRC . One member, 
who asked not to be identified, said, "People in crucial positions can 
wield too much power - there are too many inherent weaknesses." 

KSDT's 'Free Form Radio' Dumped for Playlists 
by Charles Heimler 

- Playlist or no playlist--that is 
the question already decided at 
campus radio station KSDT. 

This Wednesday, the station 
will resume its new format, 
b gun last quarter, in which 
over hal f the songs played come 
from a programmed list . 

Such d list is in marked 
contrast to the former days of 
KSDT, when disc jockeys 
selected the programming for 
their individual show . The result 
was the heyday of "free form 
radio" say its backers, or 
disorganized, inefficient, boring 
programming, according to ' its 
I)pponents . 

The instigators of this 
decision to institute 
programming were KSDT 
Program Director )teve Crouch, 
Music Director Amir Mans-
bacher, and News Director 
Bruce Hanley. 

Accordin~ to Crouch, the 

three " saw the potent ial in the 
tat ion and decided to usp the 

potential. " 
Crouch I ists three reasons for 

creating the format--it give a 
cohe iveness to the tation ' 
sound, a similarity in the tyle of 
pre entation, and a continuity 
of programming through the 
week . 

Crouch also bel ieves the 
format sets up a more effective 
tructure for produting the 

ideas people have for special 
public affairs shows. 

The KSDT playlist consists of 
about 160 songs from..all phases 
of music . This is in contrast to 
the 30-40 songs on most AM 
playlists and the 70 songs most 
FM stations play. 

The remainder of the musIc 
on KSDT, about 40 percent, is 
elected by each disc jockey or 

are req.Jests from listeners. 
Just how well KSDT's listener 

like the new programming i 
hard to determine Some DJ's 

Sieve CroMch 
ay people have left the tat'on 

because of it. 
But Crou ch insi st~ " the 

feedback I've gotten is that they 
like the sound of the station . I 
think we have more listeners, in 
tact, I know that's the case ." 

The KSDT audience is, ad-
mittedly, limited. On its 540 AM 

~ide, the station si al reachps 

only withi n campus boundaries. 
On cable, 99.5 FM, the station 
can reach a p:>tential 8,000 
ub criber in the an Diego ci t 

beach communitie . 
Th playlist is determrned, 

ays Crou ch, by " tak ing data 
from the whole radio pectrum 
and conden ing it to what we 
can u e here." 

That means he and 
Man pacher re earch playlist 
from around the country and 
pick songs being played on 
tations imilar to KSDT and 

songs popular in San Diego . 
"We offer a real alternative to 

what you can g t on the 
commercial media," believe 
Crouch . He say the ng 
cho en co nit of jazz , 
progres ive and popular mu ic 
which define the tation a "FM 
album contemporary "

Crouch, 40 per cent of that

Trainer ,Named AII·Tourney • 

UCR Trips UCI, Captures All-Cal 
UC Riv~ rside's Larry Reynolds hit two clutch free 

throws in the waning moments of the game to give 
the Highlander a dramatic aD-78, come from 
behind victory over UC I rvine for the championship 
of the first annual UCSD I nvitational Tournament. 
held here last weekend . 

The Pfnalty shots came on a one-and,me 
itualion with ' 35 left in the game and marked the 

climax of a UCR rally that overcame a nine point 
second half deficit . 

Reynolds, who tallied 25 points in the contest 
was named the Mo t Valuable Player of the 
tourney. Also named to the All-Tourney team were 
Paul Trainer of the Tritons, Irvine's Dave Baker and 
Jerry Maras, Mark Olson of Davis and Reggie Mims 
of Riverside. 

At the beginning of the championship game, UCI 
came in and shot the lights out of the gym, hitting 
on 10 of1heir first 11 shots Maras and Jerry Mraule 
led the UCI effort that combined for a 69 percent 
field goal average in the first half. 

Riverside was not left behind as Reynolds (who 
hit for 16 points in the first half), Mims and Tony 
Ma i kept the Highlanders in the game. The first 
half ended in a 42-42 tie . 

I n the opening ten minutes of the second half, 
I rvine shot to a nine point lead behind the shooting 
of Maras, Baker 3I1d Mraule . But from then on it 
wa downhill for the Anteaters as Tony Masl and 
Reynolds led the late Riverside rally that brought 
Creddie Goss and his Highlanders the Tourney title 

Riverside defeated Davis, 62-58 to advance to the 
final round, while Irvin dropp d the Tritons, 76-67 . 

AI/-Tournament selection Paul Trainer shoo Is 
over a Davis defender in the Tn'tons loss to the 
Aggies. 

The Irvi ne game was one of the Tritons "best 
Horts ye t," according to Coach Barry Cun ningham . 

Unfortunately, they wer~ match d a£ain<;t an 
xcellent Irvine team . bound for the NCAA College 

Division playoffs 

Paul Trainer led the Triton in both contests, 
getting 53 points over the two eveni ngs . George 
Calhoun also turned in an excel lent performance in 

~ oring 32 point in the tourney 

I n the can alation game. Davis riddled the UC 0 
defeme In the second half to gain a 91-67 win

Drafting Rights 
A few months ago a Federal District ourt Judge declared thp 

National Football League Draft illegal. But here it is anyway . 
The owners feel that the only way to get a good team is to have sa le 

property rights to a person, someth ing that was outlawed by amend 
ments to the Constitution of the United States (the 13th. 14th. or 15th). 
This harkens back to the old issue of slavery. only in this case it is high 
paid slavery. 

It seems. all the owners feel that all t he "superstars" of the league 
might decide to head off to San Diego, form their own "super" team . 
leaving everyone else off in the dust. 

Imagine a team that would have Kenny Stabler at quarterback. OJ 
Simpson and Otis Armstrong in the back fie ld. and Harry Bloom at 
center . 

Harry Bloom at center1??? 
Yes, Harry Bloom at center. The Draft. traditionally used to help 

teams add talent to their otherwise moribund squdd, produced a f!'w 
surprises ye terday. 

Bloom was drafted in the first round by the newest expansion club. 
the Santa Barbara Spill. Bloom was unavai lab le for comment on hiS 
sele lion . rumor has it that it was the fir t time In hi life that he hil ~ 
ver been peechle s. 

Spill Director of Personel . teve Sludge. commented. " Bloom WdS 
drafted by Santa Barbara becau e he has home town recognition He 
played hiS call ge ball here in Santa Barbara, being a InfamoLl for hI'> 
pxploits here as Joe amath is In ew York We plan to use Bloom al 
centpr wh re h will get exactly what the fan think he d!'serV!;'~. ant' 
hell of a beau ng " 

A, ('xpected. Steve Bartkow~kl of California and Randy Whltl' 01 
MarylClnd were the first two picks . The flr\t round produced no ,ur· 
prlses. except for Bloom. 

The second round of picks saw Lee Johnson being tabb d by the 
Laramie Cowboy as a Quarterback /\ cording to Cowboy scout Hill 
Hickock, Johnson was drafted because of hiS 5lle . " We don't look at 
uch things as a throwing arm anymore." aid Hickock. " WI' draft for a 

specific size. then train the person for the pmition." 
When reached lor comment, John on "cou ldn 't understand" lhr 

Cowboy's choice, but felt his "shotput ability should h Ip out when 
trymg to hit a receiver." 

The later rounds also produced a few additional San Diego draftees 
La Jolla was dralted by the wrL to help payoff all the debts incurred 
last ea on. La Jolla was drafted in the third round . after Beverly f1ill ~ 
and Chu la Vista . 

In individual action s. the Detroit Wheel picked. then announ d 
the signing of William Ma Elroy. The unu ual as~ect of the co ntract 15 
that MacElroy wi II have to pay the Wheels in order to play for them 

A Whe Is' spokesma n said that they were trying this novel approa h 
to co ntra t dealings in o rder " to bail th e club out of financia l dif-
ficulty" MacElroy, in addition to paying the club $100 v ry tlmc hr 
plays . mu t provide his own equipment and uniform . 

Ron W rft was drafted by the Anchorag [kimos in the later half ot 
the se ondary phase of th tertiary draft . The [ kimos employ a ont'-
platoon sty le of football and drafted Trainer because " the statistics and 
report we've seen lell us h can play defense as well as score " Too 
bad /\nchoragp wa~ so fr07en that no one could get OLit and observe 
Werft play . 

It seem s like every organi7ation got into the draft somehow. The 
Coop wa~ draftl'd by the Selective Service and ent to Vietnam because 
they are a bLln h of " left-wing radica ls " Ac ording to t he local 
Sel ctlve ervice office. " they will eith r learn to cooperate or they will 
die." 

A few people are miffed at their not being elected in the draft 
Jimmy Roudebush , for the th ird straight year, felt he was a ure fir t 
round selection but again was overlook d by t he pros. Sam say hi 
knees aus d th pros to pass him by, but Jimmy feels it is his graduate 
standing in math that mad the owner uneasy . "Som own rs felt 
that I might b able to take them for a few bucks when it ame to 
contract ta l k~ " 

W II Jimmy, at least you are sti ll a free man. not a slave to the 
system like many other are.

new .,how last SaturdelY night 

Thp show heralded the first truly sucre .. ,ful wpddlng of rock 
musl to theatre. dS th!' bulk of the show IS a Iwrtormance of their 
lTew double album, " Thf' Lamb LI ·s Downon Broadway " r or tho~(' 
unfamiliar With thiS fine album. the musIc chronicles a telle In tht' 
<'pic tradition of a ew York hoodlum named Rael . who IS sucked 
IIltO another world by a wall of energy that comes to Broadway He 
IS trapped In a cocoon. a cave. chambers With tilly creatur s trying 
to find the fight door out; he reminisces about hi past sex life 
(taught from a luicy book of diagrams) and hiS vandalism. and In 
turn meets Mr Death. three snake-women who lick off all hiS skill 
turn Ing him Into a bumpy. stumpy Slipperman. and Dr Dyper. wh~ 
cures by castration . as he searches for a way back home 

This epic tale. told as liner notes In the album and captured In the 
music and lyrics of the band. is brought to the conc rt tage With 
the intent of showing the whole story To thiS effect. the most 
technically stylish senes of speCial effects. costumes. lighting. 
masks. explOSions. and some 3000 rear prOjected slides allow 
Genesis to translate the maklllgs of epic theatre into rock concert 
This Brechtian approach to performance makes the band 's musIc 
incredibly more engaging than your normal concert experience 

The key focus for the show lies III lead sll1ger Peter Gabriel 
Darting about the stage, hurling fir bombs. appearlllg on various 
levels. assaulting the microphone. engu lfed 10 florescent tunnels 
and funnels of snake women appearing headless . merging as the 
Grotesque slipperman . and eventually finding himself duplicated 
and transcended into higher energies . Gabriel, while no trained 
mimist. captured and transmitted physicallity extremely well 
through h is agile body and makeup. and sealed the story so well 
that the crowd tayed hu hed throughout most of the show. waiting 
1 hour and 40 minutes to deliv r a standing ovation for the entire 
piece 

While the majority of th band eem d to tak a back seat to the 
cacophony of visual stimuli In the show. they produced a rich. 
driving, lOt grated mu IC, cleanly delivered through a fine sound
