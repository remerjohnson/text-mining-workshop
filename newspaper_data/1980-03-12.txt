Carter, Reagan 
Sweep Three 
Southern States 
President Takes 88% in 
Georgi{l; Bush Swamped 

From The Associated Pres. 
President Carter and Republican Ronald Reagan 

marched through Georgia, Florida and Alabamt 
last night, burying their White House rivals in a three-
state set of Southern presidential primary elections. 

Cl-lrler won his home Georgia Democratic primary 
by a towering margin, poIlint a dozen votes and 
more for every ballot cast for Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy. 

His Alabama margin was almost as lopsided, and 
in Florida he was reaping two-thirds of the vote while 
Kennedy captured only 16 percent. 

Reagan was the runaway victor over former CIA 
Director George Bush in aD three .tates. Florida was 
the closest thing to a contest; there it was Reagan 56 
percent, Bush 31. 

Kennedy campaigned only in florida and the 
outcomes were no surprise. But the. margins were. 

The Southern victories put Carter back in 
command in the race for Democratic nominating 
delegates . He was gaining 184, to run his national 
total to 271. Kennedy led for 22 in yesterday's -
primaries, which would put his over(lll delegate 
strength at 137. 

It wiD take 1,666 to select a Democratic 
presidential nominee. 

In Republican competition, Reagan was gaining 
105 delegates Tuesday, Bush only 9. That would 
give the former California governor 167 of the 998 
he needs tc? win the ool'llin;ltion. The Bush total.tood 
at 45. 

The Southern GOP ballots were dotted with the 
names of campaign dropouts: ConnaUy, Baker, 
Dole. 

Rep. John B. Anderson, the liberal from Illinois, 
skipped the South, saying he would try for support

SAAC 19no'red? 
Editor: 

In your latest issues of The 
Dailg Guardian, I have 
personally found it a 
disappointment to read 
nothing in reference to the 
activities of the Student 
Affirmative Action Commit-
tee nor the Third World 
studenta who organized the 
rally alainst racism last 
quarter. am wondering if die 
staff of The Daily Guardian no 
longer finds that the activities 
of these groups warrant news 
coverage. Or is it that SAAC 
is not doing anything? 

During the years I have 
attended this university, it was 
the first time that so much 
political Third World activism 
had taken place. The beauty 
of it was that Blacks, 
Chicanos, Asians and Native 
Americans came together in 
common struggle and exposed 
the racist attitudes and 
practices that I have 

' experienced at thJs institution 
of higher learning. 

- 'If abe positive" readings (incorrect 
indication of pregnancy) can disguise 
evidence of an abnormalitr, requiring 
attention; "False negative' readings 
(incorrect indication of no presnancy) 
may indicate the woman should receive 
medical treatment for unrelated 
conditions that could endanger the fetus 

- radiation treatments, innoculations, 
etc. 

-False negative readings can also 
prevent detection of an ectopic 
pregnancy (outaide the uterus). I~ .a11 
circumstances, the FDA says, a positIVe 
reading must be followed by an 
immediate visit to a doctor; if symptoms 
of pregnancy persist after a ne~a~ive 
reading, you should also see a phys~clan. 

Jfyou are a student, an alternative to 
a PTK or an expensive trip to a private 
phYlician is a visit to your ca~pus' 
health services, where profesSIOnal 
diagnosis, care, and counseling -
services that don't come in a kit - can 
be obtained. 

UCSD offers all gynecological exams 

(including pap smearl and pelvic and 
breast exams) as well as birth control 
information sessions and supplies at its 
health services center contraceptive 
clinic. If you are pregnant, counseling 
and refEl'rai services are available. You 
pay for birth control items purchased 
and all lab work .. testing and cOwtseling 
are free. The clinic may be reached at 
452-2669. 

Similar services are offered at SDSI), 
where pregnancy tests are given 42 days 
after the date of last menstruation. Lab 
work COlta $12.25 (the price of a PTK) 
and is professionally monitored and 
interpreted. In addition, two social work 
students, a registered nurse, a health 
educator and nurse practitioners are 
available for counseling. The number to 
call is 265-5281. _

Last year, particularly last

It has been disappointing 
that the paper has neglected 
any follow-up articles that 
have to do with the demands 
made by SAAC and any 
progress being made on them. 
These demands were very 
valid and important to the 
progress of Third World

reader of the paper, I must 
express that there are 
currently many issues that 
affect us, including the 
emergence of KKK activities

The Music is Always Louder On the Other Side 
BY MARCIA BRISBOIS 

A couple of months ago I moved from coastal 
Cardiff to inland Encinitas. Living in the beach area 
for the last year and a half, I'd forgotten that there are 
two lides to North County living - .ides ... d become 

Marcia Brisbois is a graduate student in English 
literature. 

very wise about during the time I worked at a local 
newspaper. 

At the old house I was used to opening my back 
door and hearing a rock and roll medley - the lady 
next door favored Eric Clapton, the group in the 
adjacent highrise preferred Pink floyd, and a loc::aI 
band joined in. Not that I minded; I'd put my faVOrite 
RoUing Stones albwn on loud and do yard work. 
Walking to the bus I'd sneak a look at the apartment 
on the corner that appeared to be inhabited by 10 to 
20 people, all under the age of 17. . . 

Here in Village Park, a condominIUm 
development located in Encinitas' growing financial 
district - four banks in a row on Encinitas Blvd. -
things are different. The first week here a nole found 
its way into the mailbox: "Please turn down your 
stereo!" 1he loudest noise one heara- and it is loud 

- is the sound of four or five Big Wheels, manned by 
tiny people, grinding down the Itreet. 

"You'd better wise up and forget all those jokes 
your family makes about North County living," I 
warned myself. 

Sure, there are cliques of people here and there 
who relentlessly pursue the unusual, the sensual and 
occasionally the healthful way of life. For example, I 
have a friend who i. a scientist. We grew up together 
in the South Bay, that confine of surburban gentility 
(enhanced by the Tijuana connection). Obviously 
she can't be anything but normal. Her co-workers are 
a different story. They're immersed in esoterica. 

First, let me point out that I am not intimately 
acquainted with these people; I see them about twice 
a year at a favorite sort of gathering - the dessert 
party, where the food served encompasses such 
f,ntastical delights as home-made eggnog and eight 
layer souffle. 

Perhaps it's the day-to-day contact with hard facts, 
sample-counting and computEI' programming that 
caUies these scientists to develop a passionate 
interest in the exotic and the obscure. Everyone of 
them collects succulents, a group of plants many of 
which, as someone who distrusts srowing things 
pointed out to me, look like the bad guys on Star 

Trek. And bizarre is better - whether it's 
pachypodiums from South Africa or the tiniest of 
stapelias or the most difficult to cultivate hoodias, 
conversation centers on finds and bargains. ' 

While the men in the group seem to get their 
satisfaction solely through plant accummulation, the 
women supplement this habit with indulgence in 
crafts. And I'm not talking macrame, crochet or 
crewel embroidery. "These wornen have full-sized 
looms and spinning wheels, or practice ancient 
Japanese arts like fish printing. And they do them 
well, without taking time-laving modern short cuts. 

The last time I saw the scientists en masse, I picked 
up an intricate basket and admired it. My friend told 
me that the hostess had made it herself. 

"It's called a lighthouse basket and it'. only taught 
on the East Coast. It took her three months just to 
learn how to do it," she whispered with the complicity 
of someone who has a closet filled with unfinished 
projects. 

As I pointed out earlier, this is only one side of the 
coin. To find the other, all one need do is drive east 
from the coast highway along anyone of the streets 
that crosses the railroad tracks. People like the 
scientists. and the ubiquitous surfer/waiters populate 
the region west of 1-5. Between the interstale and EI

Host~ges to Stay in 
Embassy ·tlntil May? 

BOGOTA, Columbia - The United States has called on 
Columbian officials to use negotiations to win the release of some 
27 hostages held by guerrillas at the Dominican Republic's 
Embassy here, it was reported yesterday. 

A second round of talks between the goverrunent and the 
captors of the mostly high-ranking diplomats is set for today a 
Foreign Ministry source said. . , 
. ,!he goverrunent released no details of any progress after the 
lrutlal round on Sunday and no reason was given for the one-day 
delay between sessions. 

One former hostage, a catering firm worker released on 
Sunday, gave a glimpse of lile inside the occupied building and 
vowed never to work in an embassy again. 

'The Columbian foreign minister and the US Embassy here 
Sunday released a list of 20 diplomatic hostages being held. 
American Ambassadqr Diego Alencio is one of the 15 
ambassadors or acting ambassadors on the list. 

The United States has told Columbian officials that 
negotiations should be used to settle the hostage' situation, 
accordmg to the Austrian Foreign Ministry. Secretary of State 
~yrus R. Vance sent a leiter to that effect to Austrian Foreign 
Minister Willi bald Pahr, the ministry said Monday. Austria's 
ambassador is one of the hostages. 

Sunday's 90-minute negotiating session was held in a van 
parked outside the embassy. The government said it was set up 
to clarify guerrilla demands and to emphasize the goverrunent's 
interest in resolving the malter. 

The government was represented by deputy foreign ministers 
Ramiro Zambrano and Camilo Jimenez. The guerrillas were 
represented by a masked woman. She was accompanied by 
Roberto Galan, the hostage Mexican ambassador, who is 
thought to have been trying to mediate between the guerrillas 
and the goverrunent. 

There reportedly were four women among the 30 guerrillas 
who stormed the embassy last Wednesday. One was wounded 
in the head during the attack and is being treated in the embassy.

Growers Not 
In Good Faith 

SACRAMENTO - A 
state farm labor board hearing 
officer ruled yesterday that a 
group of vegetable growers, 
most of whom have been 
struck by Cesar Chavez' 
United Farm Workers Union 
for more .than a year, have 
failed to bargain in good faith 
with the union. 

Administrative law officer 
Jennie Rhine ordered the 
growers to do so, and also to 
pay back wages to workers 
who were affected, most of 
them retroactive to Dec. 8, 
1978. 

The payment would be the 
difference between what they 
were paid and what they would 
have made under a union 
contract. 

The ruling affects 11 
growers, one of whom is now 
out of the vegetable growing 
business. One source 
estimated there are 1,800 to 
2,500 workers involved.

Assorted Vinyl Opens 
Soon 

On January 30 the AS 
Council approved the 
funding for the formation of 
a record co-op. Since that 
ti.-, many people have 
worked tow.d reaching that 
end. On April .. the co-op 
plans to open its doors to the 
public. The store has 
officially been named 
Assorted Viny l and we 
would like to thank those 
who cotrihuted to 9ur 
naming contest. At last, we 
hope that a service has been 
created that will satisfy the 
musical n~ of UCSD. 

The store plans to feature 

a variety of new music with 
special emphasis on current 
releases . [n addition, we will 
carry an assortment of used 
records. The quality of our 
used section will be a direct 
reflection of the tastes of our 
student body. In the next 
two weeks, you will have 
several opportunities to sell 
us your used records. The 
times are listed in this week's 
guardian. Any record that 
you don't find in our 
inventory may be ordered by 
catalogue. Our prices will be 
comparable to, or lower 
than, those you can find at 

America 

local reco rd store . W e will 
also carry various brands of 
blank tapes and related 
accessories. The videotapes 
and flants are part of our 
initia inventory as well. 

Assorted Vinyl will be 
located in the rudent 
Center, just south of EDNA. 
We will be open Monday 
through Friday from 11 am 
to 7 pm. Our telephone 
number is 452-2733. Take 
advantage of the serv ices that 
the co-op can offer you. 
Assorted Vin yl, as well as 
the other o-op in the 
Student Center, can only 
flouri sh with your upport. 

and her Universities 
As Ameri ca pass es 

through the fourth year of 
her Third Century, she is 
faced with a vast array of 
economic, cultural and 
political contradictions. The 
source of changes tn these 
social relationships has in 
the past been colleges and 
universities. What we so 
loosely refer to as " the 60s" 
was precisely this occurance. 
The most obvious contradic-
tions at that time were racial 
segregation and the Vietnam 
War, and it was fro m the 
campuses that a whole new 
c ultural conscib u ness 
emerged, with especially 
potent political ramifica-
tions. This was symbolized 
by the admission of the first 
black students t o th e 
Univers ity of Alabama (with 
Governor George W allace 
literally blocking the door) 
and the announcement that 
L.B.J. would not seek his 
paTty 's nomin at ion fo r

IJJ 
When it comes to basketball, 

even the over· magnanimous 
NCAA can't compare to UCSD. 
When the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association met two 
week. ago to plan their annual 
basketball tournament, their wise 
and .age board 01 overseers 
decided to pioneer a new concept in 
post·aea.on play·oH •. Let's bring in 
everybody and their cousin, they 
said. Who cares if Christmas ill 
supposed to be in December? 

Well, as we all know, that',l 
exactly whal happened. Twelve 
&artini. later even Virginia 
Commonwealth Will bei"ll invited. 

M~I NCAA coaches didn't even 
know if thai obacure colleg,e was in 
the US or England. 

Much 10 the NCAA's chagrin, 
however they haven'l scooped the 
world when it cornea to large, 
cumber.ome posl·season 
basketball championship', UCSD 
baa been doina it for years. A mere 
95 leam. qualified this year for 
championahip play.oIf. in six 
differenl divisions. The only team 
thai didn't make it was the kitchen 
link. That was becauae it uaed itn 
ile,aI player to tum it on one night. 

When the dllli Jetties on S\mday 
afternoon, UCSD 1M, will have 
crowned five more basketball 
champion. for 1980. In the 
interim, the action on the hardcourt 
this week has been furious, as 
teams pull out all the stops in their 
quest for good 01' No. 1. Here's a 
quick re·cap of all divisions. 

MEN'S AAA 
Capital Insulation's 66·56 upset 
over season· long No : 1 
Hardballer. has turned this division 
topsy·turvy. Double Drivel (7 -1) 
led by Pete Johnson and Steve 
Martinez hal the best record, but 
fast improving Dartos Rises (6-2) 
with the league's, biggest front. line 
i. playing hot. 

MEN'S AA 
'The basketball couldn't have been 
any better or more exciting last 
Monday night as two quarterfinal 
games were decided at the hom. 
Sharpshooting Bert Hansen hit 
two 3.point bombs in the last 2 
minutes to get No.·l rated Inputs. 
Outputl a 47·47 tie in regulation 
and then won the game with a fall· 
away 18-fooler at the buzzer as the 
Kaypunch Boys won a 53·52 
thriller over the Hydra. 

In an even more bizarre finiah, 
the X.Vikes 6terally stole a 49-47 
decision over No. 2 rated Snatch 
Players. Trailing 47·44 with 6 
seconds to play, the X.Vikes 
inbounded the ball underneath their 
own hoop, fed Hal Jacobs for a 25-
foot 3.pointer that lied the game, 
and then .at back and watched the 
Snalch Players sefl-deslruct in the 
game',faat second. A.Jacob's hop 
went in, the Snatch Players called 
an alegal 4th time out. Technical 
foul time. Jacoba gqged badly on 
the free throw to apparently give 
the Players another life, but with

1M Basketball Playoffs: 
one second remamlng x· Vike 
forward Mickey Miller lofted a 
rainbow lob pass from out· of. 
bounds that center Bob Allen 
tapped in at the buzzer. It was the 
thrill·of.victory, agony of d feat all 
over again. 

The other two spots in the AA 
final four went to teams with 
diametrically opposed back· 
grounds. Defending champ 
Hooterville Express struggled to a 
.Ioppy 33·31 win over the Cunning 
Lingui.ts, while this year's sleeper 
the Cap' bombed the previously 
unbeaten Crows right out of La 
Jolla, 65-41. Graham Haun tallied 
18 points and played a strong role 
as Chairman of the Boards to pace 
the Caps. 

MEN'S A 
This division is up lor grabs as 

Ulual_ A real crapshoot, if you will. 
After Down & Dirty exiled the 
Ayatollahs on Sunday 62-36 and 
the Downtown Bomber. walloped 
the Mucket. 40·19, this division 
resembled Florida's Gulf Coast 
after a hurricane. I mean, the 
Ayatollahs and Mucketl, both 7·0 
at the time, were supposed to be 
I{ood. Oh well, 50 much lor the 
lorm sheet. 

The new pretenders for the Class 
A crown could come from anyone 
of a motley bunch. Never Up-
Never In has the inside track and a 
7· 1 record, but don't count out 
Forfeit (7.0) and The Old Java 
Men (6-1) 

MEN'S 5·10 
The mighty mite division played 

cbaracteristic basketball in 
Monday night's quarters'. Fast, 
scrappy, and almost out of control. 
Watching 5·10 basketball at 
UCSD is like watching a two·ton 
semi drive down San Francisco's 
famed Lombard St. at 90 mph. 

Monday's games were xerox 
copied of each other. In the Rec 
Gym, No. 1 rated Popcorn had to 
rally in the game's late stages to 
produce a 50·43 win over 
Questionable. Chuck Bossett 
tossed in 20 big ones Irom outer 
space for Questionable, but it 
wasn't enough .• haft got 19 points 
Irom Silky Stern to do a number of 
the Fearsome 5 Prong. The score? 
You guessed it. 50·43. 

In the Main Gym the results 
were similar if not identical. 
Endochondral whipped Mr. Bill'. 
Friends 57·49 and- fast breaking 
Magical Press did likewise in a 57-
45 win over the Bucketeen.

Guys and gals basketball could 

be competitive this year. Gone are 
the days when the Original 
Basketcases (two. time defending 
champions) are conceded the title. 
In fact, the OBC's even lost a game 
this year! In league play at that. 
Janice Yip's GYST group ended 
UCSD's longest 1M winning streak 
at 28 games with a convincing 47· 
36 win over OBC on the last day of 
the regular season. With GYST 
(now 8·0) starting to get their stuff 
together, other teams trying for a 
.bol at the title, will need to proceed 
with caution_ The Lawnrnowers (8· 
0) and Fobo might have the best 
chance, but a couple of carkhorsea 
are starting to move up in the 
backstretch. Mixed Vegetables (6· 
0) wil" super player Harry 
Holfman back from the hospital 
are a definite threat. And then, 01 
course, there', this other team that 
kows what it's like in the play·offs .

notice. That famous line from 
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance 
Kid" was resurrected. "Who is that 
guy!" was heard more than once. 

Come Sunday afternoon, when 
Kreeger romped through the mile 
run in 5:13, everone knew him. 
This kid had tal en!. 

The Revelle sophomore, in 
typical Bruce Jenner fashion , had 
just ocmpleted the gruelling 4.day, 
9·event individual competition to 
outdistance runnerup Hal Light by 
a whopping 400 points and the 
next nearest finisher Rich Raux by 

nearly 770. 
The tall, lanky athelete was 

nothing short of sensational with 
steady performances in all nine 
events_ His final tally sheet looked 
like this : 
60 yard dash 6.70 
Field Goals 140 yards (4.5) 
Softball Throw 224 feet 
Bowling 152 
50.yard Free 30.92 
Softball Hit 705 ft (5 hits) 
Basketball Supershot 52.5 points 
High Jump 5·4 
Mile Run 5:13 

In the process, Kreeger bested 
the most comp titive field ever in 
the 5-year history of uper~tars . 
All-time record holder Jim Senz 
finished 4~h with 5096 points. 
Defending champion Gil Ruiz 
finsihed 5th wit h 5053_ And 16 
competi tors finished with ov r 
4000 point s, easily the most 'ever in 
this competition. 

All in all, 5 individual records 
were set in addition to Kreeger's a ll-
events point lotal_ The most 
notable was Ignacio Silva's 70 
points in the Basketball upershot 
event. Silva driUed 10 consecutive 
22·foot jump shots in the one· 
minute drill to completely demolish 
the old record of 45 liz points. His 
mark earned him 1167 points on 
the Superstars scoring table, easily 
the best competitive mark in the 
history of the Superstars. In fact, it 
was only the 3rd time that any 
competitor had maxed the 
Superstars point table standard of

The road to victory for Jacobs-
Chuman was not without its ' 
potholes. Dooley.Meivin defeated 
the pair earlier in the double· 
elimination 1-1-9. 14.12 to gain the 
finals of the winners' bracket. It 
was Jacobs' first individual match

through the arduous and difficult 
re·entry bracket.

the first point table max, and earlier 
in this year's competition, Rick 
Wilbert found the 22-foot ranl{e to 
his liking and popped in enough 
hoops to garner 65 1h points (and 
1091 on the Superstars table). 

A number of other notable 
milestones were achieved in other 
events. Gil Bender bowled the first 
2oo.game in history with a nifty 
205, while Lisa Johnson became 
the first woman to clear the 5-foot 
barrier in the high jump with an 
excellent leap of 5 foot even. 
Johnson shattered the old women's 
standard by over a foot, and also 
garnered 900 uperstar points for 
her effort to easily be t the 25 men 
in the comp tit ion . 

The oldest record in the books 
also cam tumbling on Friday 
when Bria n Lanvif>re ki ked 4 out

Odds and ends from the Czar's 
desk at Intramural Central, 
U.S.A.: 

It was a long week for 
Intramural Sports addicts Chris 
Liotta, Ken Clifton and Fred 
Blesch. A fter a season of nothing 
but the sweet taste of success in five 
intramural sports this quarter, their 
gingerbread ~ouse finally came 
tumbling down during the week of 
March 3·12. Rated number one or 
near the top in every 1M sport they 
entered, Clifton, Liotta, Blesch and 
Co. went to the slaughterhouse this 
week. Masochists take note: 

Their 1M basketball team. 
Dribbling Idiots. after winning 4 
straight , lost their final four games 
including a 44<·39 loss in the 
playoffs. Their Open Minds soccer 
teams (of which they have two 
(Men and Coed) got waxed 3-2 
and -0 in the Kahuna Cup soccer 
playoffs . Their bowling team. Up 
Your Alley, in 2nd place a ll season 
long dropped 2 ~traight, the last 
one in the playoff~ _ In Ilawaiian 
Football, a fter leading everyone all 
season long, they got nudged on 
the last play of the game in a 64·58 
thriller against Flying Crab Lice. 
And then there's Floor Hockey. 
where their stacked tealn was 
supposed to run away and hide 
with the championship. Alas! It 
was not to be_ When Clifton and 
Liotta returned home after another 
devastating loss in Team Bowling 
(their II th consecutive setback in 
9 days), they both looked at each 
other and simultaneously said 
"Boy, do we ever need a beed" 
They wellt to the refrigerator, 
opened the door. "Damn, we're 
outta Bud." Poor guys, they 
couldn't even cry in their beer. (Ed. 
note: If you see Messrs. Liotta and 
Clifton wandering around in a 
stupor this week, please point them 
in the right direction ... the 
Coronado Bridge is that·away_)

Suffer Another 
Loss to USIU 

BY SCOTT AUISON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD m e n 's 
volleyball team suffered 
another disapPointing loss 
last night when they bowed 
to the United States 
International University 
Gulls, three games to one. 

, The match was almost 
identical to the Feb. 26 loss 
to U S I U: in both contests 
the Tritons were Qut· 
scrapped . and outplayed , 
and both matches had 
UCSD Coach Dough 
Dannevik scratching his -
head in bewilderment over 
his SQuad's inadequacies. 

" I just can't put my finger 
on the problem," he said . 
" We play hot and cold, we 
don't pass the ball, and we 
lose our concentration. I 
just wish I knew why." 

" It seems that UCSD has 
a patent in the art of losing 
close games this year, and

the first game last nighLwas 
no exception. USIU won 
the rallies that counted and 
did what teams have been 
doing all year in games 
against the Tritons, which is 
take a one game 10 none 
lead. 

In game two the Tritons' 
starting lineup looked 
horrible , and Dannevik 
tried to shake things up by 
inserting seldom· used Hal 
Light, Monte Frankel and 
Rich Cazares into the 
lineup. It did not help , and 
the Gulls' rs · l1 win was 
not as close as the score 
indicates. 

If only to avoid being 
swept UCSD played 
commendably in game 
three , the Tritons' only 
victory. But USIU 
slammed the door on the 
spikers with a 15·12 win in 
the fourth contest, 
completing an all too 

The Daily Guaralan 

familiar script In the 
Tritons' season. 

" I have to hand it to 
USIU. They' re scrappy, " 
said Dannevik. 

"We always get up for 
games against UCSD, " 
said USIU Coach Ray 
Ratelle, who was sporting a 
huge grin after the game. 
"We respect them. Hey, 
they 've beaten Berkeley 
and Stanford, two teams 
who have blown us out. "

Men Reach 8th 
In SwiDl Nat'ls 

Hernandez' 3rd IS Best Finish 
Continued from page 5 
placings, not for times. Joe 
Hernandez took the best 
individual finish for UCSD 
with his third place finish in the 
200 free. He trailed the same 
two swimmers who beat him in 
°last year's nationals. He won' t 
get another chance for 
revenge, as they both 
graduate and he switches to 
NCAA next year . 

All three UCSD relays took 
All · American honors. The 
800 free relay of Roger 
Kirton, Lance Halsted , John 
Beckley and Joe Hernandez 
finished fifth with a 7:05 .9 
time. The 400 free relay 
finished seventh, and the 400 
medley relay took tenth. 

Bob Conlin pulled one of the 
biggest surprises in the meet 
with his 10th place in the 1650 
free . He also barely missed the 
top 12 in the 500 with his 
4:48.4 14th place finish , just 
ahead of Roger Kirton in 16th 

place. 
Lance Halsted, normally 

the fastest in the group, had an 
uncharacteristically poor meet 
after last year's seventh in the 
500 and eighth in the 1650. 

Mark Allen won the 
consolation heat of the 200 
individual medley, taking 
seventh place by over a full 
body length. Good times also 
came from Kevin Lingle in the 
100, John Beckley in the 100 
and 200, and Steve Beal with 
his drop of a couple seconds in . 
the 200 bUllerfiy. 

Not a single national NAJA 
record fell at the meet, highly 
unusual for a national 
c hampionship . Swimming, 
however, is but a small part of 
the experience of a national 
meet. 

Chris Dixon got the team 
psyched up wI-en he shaved 
his head for the competition.

country with a heritage 
dominated by machilmo , 
makes Portrait 01 Teresa

The Teresa character is the

mother, and her occupation as 
a textile factory worker and 
cultural activities director. 

Another see-saw effeel 
occurs between Teresa's 
desire to create a lifestyle that 
she CA.n call her own, and the 
demands of her husband, 
Ramon, that she stick to her 
hou.ehold taaks . Their 
differences soon culminate in a 
fiery bedroom confrontation. 
Here the heroine must choose 
between two alternatives: hold 
onto her dream and risk the 
loss of a husband, or save her 
marriage and abandon the 
fulfillment of an aspiration. 

The story of Teresa's battle 
of priorities and perseverance 
is brought to identifiable and 
life· like terms by scenarists 
Pastor Vega and Ambrosio 
Fomet. 

AdoUo Uurato and Daiay Granados star in 'Portrait of Teresa.' 

Vega's direction of the film 
exposes every single myth and 
misconception of the do's and 
don'ts for men and women. 
Viewers reael to them with 
anger, discomfort , embar-

The acting is nothing short

striking is Adolfo Uuradg in 
his role of the tradition-minded 
Ramon. Supporting cast

so much this year that he had 
little to lose anyway. Continued from page 2 Camino Real lies the 

intermediate zone, settled with 
some of the area's biggest 
flower lJ~rowers on the spine of 
the hila that border the

at this area and aero.. tJ 
Camino Real lie the major 
traeta, inhabited by fuD-time 
working stiffs and _ the 
oc:caaional retired couple. 

Which brings me to another 
high achooI friend, aIao from 
the South Bay, who moved 
into the commuter zone with J- family. She hal a little boy,

of them at a local 
Nei,hborhood Watch 
CamInittee meetinI; the other 

woman's husband works with 
. her husband. Talk at the table 
centered around interest rates, 
crime rates, toddler swimming 
courses offered at the Y, and 
local preschools. We ate tuna 
sandwiches and a tossed salad 
- no sprouts. 

My intent is not to ridicule 
any of my· friends or their 
acquaintances and co-
workers. I'm jUit intrigued by 
the change in neighbors one 
encounters in a two-mile 
move. After all, I reminded 
myself, you know that North 
County is a place occupied for 
the most part by middle-clau 
and . upper-middle cia .. 
working people trying to lead 
safe, decent lives away from 
the problems of the more 
consested parts of the county. 
And it's combatting these 
problems that cuts 8Croas the 
interests group and reunites 
the disparate element.. When

together as a people in 
common struggle. 

I want to end this letter by 
stating that The Daily 
Guardian must have an 
interest and responsibility to 
continue to expose the 
activities of SAAC and the 
·students who are pursuing the 
reality of Third World unity 
and solidarity because as 
individual groups, we are 
weak politically. If we 
consolidate our efforts in 
struggle, we can overcome our 
opposition and the oppression 
which governs us as a people 
in the United States.
