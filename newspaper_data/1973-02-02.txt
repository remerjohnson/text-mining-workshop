Psychological Services: Coping With "Disfunctionality" 
Charlie Helmler 

Students at UCSD encounter various 
problems stemming from their being 
part of and dealing with an institution. 
Two campus groups are concerned 
with helping students to function 
better while at UCSD. 

Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices, while helping students to cope 
with their problems, emphasizes the 
preventative approach, helping 
students to anticipate problems, 
thereby furthering their capacity for 
dealing with them. The offices are 
located on the 6th floor of Building 20, 
and can be reached at extension 2715. 

The Adaptive learning Program is 
concerned with helping students 
develop strategies for organizing 
course material; enabling students to 
improve their retention and grades. 
Learning is also located on the 6th floor 
of Building 20, and can be phoned at 
ext. 2401. 

According to Mort Shaevitz, Direc-
tor, Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices, there are five general problems 
that students who come to the Center 
are concerned with, these being 
problems of intimacy, separation, 
coping with adulthood, questioning of 
self-esteem and the question, "Where 
am I goingl" He refers to the people 
who come to the Center as having 

what he calls "temporary distunc-
tionality," being faced with short-term 
problems. 

Students can make an appointment 
to see someone at the Center, and 
seldom have to wait more than two 
days for an appointment. If necessary, 
a student can talk to one of the staff 
immediately. 

When a person visits the Center, he 
is asked to fill out a card with his name 
and other demographic information, 
which is held in confidence. He and a 
counselor then talk, giving the student 
an opportunity to share his problem 
with someone else, and in the process 
enable the counselor to understand 
the circumstances which let the stu-
dent to seek aid. 

After the initial meeting, a student 
may feel that issues are resolved and 
that further meetings are not 
necessary. If this is not the case, the 
student may continue in individual 
sessions, join with other students who 
have similar concerns in a meeting 
with a counselor, or meet with his 
domestic partner(s) and a counselor. 

While the Counseling and 
Psychological Services Center deals 
with remedial problems, it's main ob-
Jective is of pursuing a preventative 
approach to dealing with issues. 
Toward this end, it conducts various 

workshops exposing people to various 
skills which help in dealing with their 
concerns. 

Shaevitz feels that the Center is 
successful in its objectives. The Center 
is in constant assessment of itself, and 
through periodic foIJowups with 
students that have come to the Center, 
Shaevitz feels that most students who 
participate in ' one of the Services' 
programs or sees one of the counselors 
resolve their problems and are able to 
function normally. 

Several academic support services 
are provided by the Adaptive Learning 
Program, through individual and small 
group tutoring and clinics. Signup for 
programs are held the beginning of 
each quarter. 

According to Rick Whitehill, Direc-
tor, Adaptive Learning Program, 200 to 
300 stud nts per quarter participate in 
th Program's reading, study skills and 
writing, and math clinic . 

In the reading and study kill clini , 
th mphasi i on developing 
strategies for organizing information 
into what i important and unimpor-
tant. General problem olving skill are 
taught on an individual and small 
group basis. 

Application of math in cia s s i 
stress d in th math clinics, and In th 
writing clinl students rec ive help in 

the organization of papers written for 
classes. 

Whiteh ill explains that the major 
emphasis of the Adaptive Learning 
Pr ogram is on providing un-
dergraduate tutors for 500 students 
each quarter. These tutors encourage 
students in the development of 
strategies which involve the process of 
organizing material and through the 
use of a specific problem solving 
method, apply the information to the 
courses the student is enrolled in . 

Whitehill f els tha t UCSD is a con-
tent heavy school, and in their preoc-
cupation with facts, some students do 
not develop an overview of the courses 
th yare in and as a re ult are not 
conscious of the pro SS(!S that occur 
in learning. It is the Program' objec-
tive to develop such a con ciousn ss in 
tudents, with the result bing that 

students are able to creatively apply

ad Woman Maal 
K~ren Armit~ge 

Last Th ~Jrsday, Pre-Med women met'in Winzer Com-
mons for a discussion of common goals and problems. 
The chief speaker and organizer was Ms. Doreen 
Kossove, a third-year student at UCSD Medical School. 

This was a preliminary organizational meeting in 
which future activities were organizaed and question-
naires were filled out as to background and needs of 
the women present. 

Ms. Kossove/s lecture was laced with laughter and 
knowing smiles as women in the audience apparently 
identifieid with the experiences and fears related by 
Ms. Kossove about her Pre-Med years. Remarks like 
" Wh y be a doctor? Be a teacher! You/II be home when 
the kids are home," brought laughter and realization of 
common problems to the forty women attending. 

Ms. Kossove also spoke on the advantage of being a 
woman in medicine and introduced the concept of 
"positive honesty" as an approach to interviews and 
filling out applications. 

One oj two men present spoke from personal 
experience on dealing with failure if one is not 
accepted into medical school. The general conclusion 
was that never applying to medical school and thus 
never knowing was much harder to live with than 
applying and not being accepted. 

The meeting was adjourned as those present broke 
up into small groups and signed up for work.s~~ps an.d 
discussions to be held in the future. ActiVIties will 
include atrending medical school classes, working on 
applications, attendbg Grand Rounds and workshops 
on how to handle an interview. 

Women who missed this meeting are urged to attend 
the next meeting which will be on Friday, February 9. 
Attendance at this meeting is required in order to 
participate in the coming activities, as women will 
undergo special tests to measure the effectiveness of 
the progra":J .

NBSSO Gets Donation 
A check for 5635 has been presented by the Black 

Students Union of Mira Costa College to uc San 
Diego's National Black Science Student Organization. 
The money will support clinics and research on sickle 
cell anemia, an inherited disease peculiar to black 
people. 

" Most of the money will come back to us," said Pete 
Mingo, Mira Costa BSU president. "We don't have the 
skills ourselves for making the medical tests and doing 
the follow-up lab work, so we gave the money to the 
organization that will do it for us." 

The money, and several hundred dollars more, was 
raised last year through BSU-sponsored dances and 
parties and a $300 gift from the Oceanside Junior 
Women Club. Some funds were spent last year holding 
clinics for about 500 persons in the Oceanside-
Carlsbad area. 

A clinic is tentatively set for February or March in the 
Mira Costaa gym, with the UCSD-based group coming 
up to do the medical chores and local BSU personnel 
assisting. 

Mingo said the BSU would not concern itself ex-
clusively with the sick le cell cause in the coming 
semester. 

Nierenberg 
Announces Two 
New SIO Profs 

Hannah Cohen 
Dr. William A. Nierenberg, Director of Scripps 

Institution of Oceanography, announced the appoint-
ment of two women assistant professors, Tanya 
Atwater, a geophysicist, and Miriam Kastner, geologist. 

Dr. Atwater, is a native Californian and currently a 
resident of Del Mar. She completed her doctoral work 
in earth sciences in June at UCSD. Her undergraduat!,! 
work was done in electrical engineering at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at University 
of Californ ia, Berkeley where she received a B.A. 
degree in geophysics. At Berkeley Dr. Atwater 
graduated phi Beta Kappa . 

During the summer of 1965, Dr. Atwater was a 
summer fellow at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institu-
tion , in Massachusetts. During the next few years she 
held several research positions at Departamento de 
Geofisica y Sismologia, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, 
Chile, and at Stanford University. 

Dr. Atwater has published ten research papers which 
came out of her geophysical investigations aboard 
Scripps research vessels working in the Pacific Ocean. 
She has taken part in five Scripps expeditions and has 
studied plate tectonics and the movement of vast 
crustal plates on the sea floor . 

Dr. Kastner was born in Czechoslovakia and raised in 
Israel. She received both her B.S. and M.S. degrees in 
geology from Hebrew University, Jerusalem.She com-
pletee her PhD work at Harvard Unive rsity, in 1970. 
While a student at Harvard, Dr. Kastner spent two 
months at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory at 
Columbia University . After a year as a research 
associate at Harvard and one year at the University of 
Chicago, she joined Scripps in 1972. Dr. Kastner came 
to the United States in 1964 on a full scholarship from 
Harvard University as well as on a Fullbright travel 
grant. 

Dr. Kastner's research is involved with zeolite 
diagenesis in marine and non-marine environments, 
their geochemical implications, and the stability 
relations between zelites and felspars. Her current list 
of publi cations numbers thirteen, with four 
manuscripts in progress .

Vial Cullure Program 
Greg Hkfs 

On Tuesday evening the first oftwo Vietnam cultural 
programs was presented in the Revelle Cafeteria. The 
program, presented by the Union of Vietnamese in the 
U.S., consisted of two movies, "Struggle for Life" and 
"The Victory of Dien Bien Phu." -

The first of these films portrayed the destruction 
which the U.S. inflicted on the Vietnamese country and 
people, and the activites of the group to whom the film ' 
was dedicated, the Medical Corps of the Provisional 
Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. 

The film opened with photographs of the cratered 
Vietnamese countryside, close-up photos of bomb 
explosions, and an indictment of U.S. distribution of 
harmful chemical agents in Vietnam. 

Segments of the film showing the torture and murder 
of unarmed Viet Cong soldiers (in line with the 
philosophy that "the only good Viet Cong is a dead 
Viet Cong") brought home the impact in human terms 
of the war in Vietnam. The same message was reaf-
firmed by a portrayal of incidents of civilian massacre 
and widespread displacement of Vietnamese civilians. 

The film, which was made a number of years ago, 
included an exhortation to the American people to 
work to stop the killing in Vietnam. The remainder of 
the movie portrayed the actlvitites of the PRG health 
corps In the face of the massive destruction which the 
film depicted. 

The second film dealt with the struggle of the 
Vietnamese against French colonialism. The struggle 
culminated in the decisive battle of Dien Bien Phu, 
which resulted in a French defeat. The people, the film 
said, were "determined not to be enslaved" by the 
French colonialists. An overriding theme of the film 
was the-massive effort and sacrifice of the people of 
Vietnam in accomplishing such things as the movement 
of heavy artillery over rough countryside into a posi-
tion to attack the French stronghold of Dien Bien Phu. 
The determination and willingness to undergo 
hardships made possible the final triumph of the 
Vietnamese.

to one of the organizers, 
Steve Barkley. The reason is 
that students are not 
signing up to work in the 
House. "It is getting to the 
point," Barkley said, 
"where someone will show 
up to work maybe 10 
minutes before we are 
schedualed to open. We 
can't operate like that. " 

Barkley sai d that the 
House will now have to 
open only on Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday, large 
volu m nights, if it is to 
exist. He added that the 
House is forced to do this 
only b cause of the lack of 
volu nteers. 

Each volunteer need 

only sit behind the counter 
and make change. But un-
less a student volunteer has 
signed up to work , the 
House can/t open. 

" The only othe r 
solution," said Barkley, "is 
for us to double our prices 
and hire a student to heop 
out. We certainly don 't 
want to have to do this. But 
unless we have mor e 
volunteers sign up in the 
Revelle Resident Dean 's 
office we won't we able to 
stay open." 

This week the House will 
be closed until Thursday. It 
will re-open Thursday, but 
whether it will stay open 
will depend upon the in-
terest of the st udents.

Graduate Student Council News Bulletin 
This is the first of a series of newsletters presented by 

the Graduate Student Council. The Council, a 
representative organization of the graduate students at 
UCSD will in the future publish more of these 
newsletters, not only to inform the students about 
matters of current interest, but also to enhance their 
input into the deliberations of the University ad-
ministration. 

The Council was formed in 1969 to introduce 
graduate representation on the administrative com-
mittees. This was unique since nothing of this kind 
existed at that time for the graduate students. Since 
then GSC has advanced, contributed to many major 
University decisions and in gen ral has tried to make 
the life of graduate students better on this campus. Its 
membership consists of two representat ives from each 
department who in turn elect a chairman. This year's 
chai rman is Eric Hartwig, a grad student from 510. The 
Council meets twice a month and the general student 
body is expected to provide its input through the 
departmental representative. 

During the first quarter of this year the Council's 
main efforts have included attempts to make the 
graduate representation a viable force, to revitalize the 
Council's structure with the h.~lp of a constitution 
(soon expected to be put befol', the general student 
body for ratification), to decide Its position on major 
issues like the in -candidacy fee, the report of the 
sta tewide library task force, the university microfilm 
requirement and the possibility of a state-wide 
organization for the graduate students. The most 
recent project has b en a survey of the financial 
support given in different departments. Most of these 
issues will b discussed in forthcoming letters. 

The Council has played an important role in planning 
of the Fourth Coli ge (suggest d to b called Eleanor 
Roosevelt Coli gel . We are qUit aware of th lack of 
the graduat -u ndergraduate contact on this campus 
and would lik to mak ev ry ffort to corr ct the 
situation, if possible as a special Hort in the Fourth 
Colleg . Our r pr S ntative therefor i also a m mb r 

of . the .subcommittee for student counselling and 
Orientation. The proposals of the subcommittee are to 

. be announce soon. Through our r ti, we have also 
expres~ed our d.issatisfaction over the stringent general 
educatIon requirements as suggested in the planning 
committee's tentative proposal. We believe that such 
stringent requirements are contrary to the spirit of the 
college and would often be a hindrance to a successfull 
implementatin of the program. Those interested may 
reach our representative Pradeep Kumar at ext. 1037 in 
the Physics Department. 

Bob Brown, a grad student in math has been 
instrumental in working out an agreeme~t with the 
Housing Office through which single grad students 
will be able to live in the Mesa apartments. Currently 5 
two-bedroom apartments are available. Two buildings 
(16 apartments) are being allocated for single students. 
Som~ of these apartments are presently occupied by 

marrle~ students. Further availability depends on 
vacancies. c~eated by married students already living in 
those bUildings and the needs of singgle students. 

This policy is subject to review. If a real increase in 
family need develops, the priority may be reverted 
back to the students with the family . Nevertheless, it is 
a very attractive prospect. Especially since these 
apartments are the cheapest housing available near the 
campus . The rent is $120.00 a month, with at least 2 and 
at most 4 occupants. Further details may be obtained 
from the Housing Office. 

Margaret Mead To Speak 
Margaret Mead will speak in San Diego on the 

evening of Thursday, Feb. 8. Her talk is scheduled for 8 
p.m. in the Multi-Purpose Room of the Veterans 
Administration Hospital, 3350 La Jolla Village Drive. 

She will be discussing human settlement patterns of 
the future as they relate to education, family planning, 
communication, work and leisure. Members of the 
audience will have an opportunity for questions 
following her talk. 

The event is sponsored by University of California 
Extension and is open to any interested person. The fee 
is $3.00 for the general public, $1 .00 for students. 

To reserve a place, pre-registration through the 
University Extension office is suggested. Tickets will 
also be available at the door. For further information,

Robert Duncan Poetry 
Robert Duncan, the famous San Francisco poet, will 

read at UCSD on Feb. 7. Duncan, one of the leading 
poets of the Black Mountain group and perhaps the 
main figure of the San Francisco Renaissance, is 
generally considered one of the great masters of the 
"open form. " He has published numerous books of 
poetry Bending the Bow, Roots and Branches, The 
Opening of the Field etc.;and his HD. Book, a tribute 
to a beautiful woman poet, is an ongoing exploration 
of the relation of poetry to the human spirit. He will 
read and talk with students in the Formal Lounge, 
Wednesday afternoon Feb. 7 at 4:00 P.M. The reading is 
part of a series cosponsored by the Literature Depart-
ment and the Campus Wide Programming Board, 
which will also bring George Oppen to this campus ' 
Feb. 28. Duncan will be here as part of the Revelle 
guest-in-residence committee. All students are 
welcome to attend the reading and discussion 
afterward-

"Achieving Meaningful Relationships" 
"Achieving Meaningful Relationships" is the title of a 

one day seminar to be presented on Saturday, Feb. 10 
on the UCSD campus. The aim of the'course is a better 
understanding of how to choose and maintain a 
fulfilling relationship with a member of the opposite 
sex . 

The program format , will be practical 
in nature. Proceeding from a background of the 
principles involved, we will move on to describing 
techniques which can be actually used in making 
decisions about a mate and in imp roving an existing 
relationship ." 

The course begins at 9 a.m. in Room 2722 of USB at

On January 18, 1973, Interpol, the world-wide polling 

organization, conducted a survey on the Revelle cam-
pus of UCSD. The aim of the survey was to evaluate the 
estent of student involvment in the current parking 
crisis. 

The questions were of the "yes-no-I don 't know" 
variety . Below are the questions and results.

Interpol, it will be remembered, won the Joe Pyne 
Award for Enterprising Polling with the question, "Do 
you still beat your wife?" 

Henry Kissinger, contacted at the underground 
parking lot of the American Embassy in Paris said, 
"Parking space is at hand," and promptly ran into a 
concrete pillar. 

Senator George McGovern was also asked for an 
opinion . Interv iewed while in Boston, behind the 
Massachusetts Curtain, he made th is statement : " Of 
course, we must always be wary of public opinion 
polls." He went on to add, " .. . wh y, I can remember the 
time when - and this is recent - I myself -" 

ORGANIC PARKING 
(This was written for us by Francois Leon, one of the 

first nature freaks . In 1966, at the request of the Baton 
Rouge Vice Squad, he became a hermit , ret iring to the 
Louisiana bayou country. Write, f .L. , Box 213 RFD, 
Oola, La .) 

Man is an animal, and like most animals (aardvarks 
and peccaries not included), is dependent on his 
environment for his life and livelihood . Unlike other 
animals less highly evolved, man can kill for profit. Yes, 
a tree was killed to make this paper; an ink plant pulled 
from the ground to form these letters. Modern life is 
filled with death and destruction. 

Organ ic living is a viable alternative to all this wanton 
destruction. To life in the city, we offer the great open 
spaces. To crowded freeways, we answer with bicycles. 
And to government bureaucrats, we offer to kill the 
SOB's! 

On your cam pus, recent construction has caused 
many parking problems. At the risk of being an I-told-
you -so ... well, I told you so. Synthetic living causes 
synthetic problems. Organic living, on the other hand , 
produces love, happiness, and hootchie-cootchie on 
the waterbed. 

Before you can have organic parking, however, you 
must first have organic transportation. This means 
horses, llamas, and dogs (mules are synthetic). 

Horses are the biggest of the three and aren't 
recommended at all. Aside from being big, they're also 
mean and nasty . They are prone to snap character 
judgements, tyhey are tactless in polite conversation, 
and have poor table manners. But if that ' your trip and 
you can dig it, they're great. 

Llamas aren't much better. They do produce organic 
fur , though, which gives you an excuse to buy that 
spinning wheel you've always wanted. They aren 't 
suitable for use around young d ildren because of their 
love for off-color jokes. Of course, looking at it another 
way, they're great for stag part i~5 . 

I like all these animal - for frlellds, that is. But given a 
choice, I' ll take dogs every time. \ hy? Dogs are easy to 
train, easy to ke p, and ea y to beat up on. Of the 
animals discussed, dog , e :h ,,0:;( Ivral. n.c " ill

Piano Seminar 
The general public is invited to participate in a 

seminar in piano conducted by Howard Wells, noted 
California pianist, to be held Wednesdays from 9-11 a.m. 
at USCD. 

The class is held in 431 HL Bldg. on the Revelle 
campus. 

Wells received his, early training with Thilo Becker in

Black Cinderella 
Hollywood produces few 

safisfying films thesE' c:lay~, 
but " Black Girl" is one of 
them. Director Ossie Davis 
stick s to the basics of 
characterization, dialogue 
and interaction, working 
from a fine play by Ms. J.E. 
Franklin. There is little 
flahy "production value" 
hereno sensational drug 
busts, violence, sex or 
breathtaking chase 
sceenes. It's a straight-
forward story of a com-
plicated black family, the 
self-destructive forces 
within it, and their resolu-
tion. 

The cast is uniformly ex-
cellent, without a single 
outstanding performance 
to outshine the others, or a 
weak one to detract from 
them. The characte rs are so 
believable as people you 
forget the actingand that's 
a high compliment to the 
film . 

As drama, it is not par-
ticu larly a milestone, but · 
"Black Girl" is always in-
teresting and conveys a 
moral lesson in powerful 
fashion . As an evening's 

Captain Beefheart has 
always had the problem of 
bing inaccessi bble to the 
great mass of record buyers 
because of his, shall we 
say, somewhat advanced 
ideas. As his childhood 
friend Frank Zappa said , 
"No commercial poten-
tiaL" Ironically, Zappa 
himself has enjoyed a great 
deal of success, due mainly 
to self-made claims about 
the advanced nature of his 
music. Of the two, there's 
little doubt that Captain 
Beefheart will emerge, 
despite his taciturn dignity, 
as the more 
revolutionary. Although 
perhaps not in his lifetime. 

Critical acclaim has 
never been lacking, but it's 
nice to sell a few records 
too. Apparently Beefheart 
and his new producer Ted 
Templeman have reached 
the same conclusion, 
because his latest album, 
"Clear Spot"(Reprise 2115) 
comes across as a strong 
bid for co mmercial 
success. 

Not entirely vanished, 
but certa inl y relegat d to a 
suppo rt ing role, are the 
weirdo rhythms and avant-
garde jazz interludes of 
Be fheart's last few 
albums . He's not back 
singin' the blues like on 
those early 'a &m singles ex-
actly, but he is operating at 
pretty nearly the level of 
his first album, which with 
its hummable melodies 
and fairly standard rock & 
roll instrum ntation is still, 
I believe, his biggest seller 
to date. 

The songs ar actual 
"songs," with verses and 
choruses and their 
meanings are not hard to 
figure out. "My H ad Is My 
Only House Unless It 
Rains" sou nds as conven-
tional as something by Lou 
Rawls. "Crazy Little Thing" 
simply raves about som 
wild f male of B fh art's 
acquaintance . "Long 
Neck d Botti s" is a fairly 
straight blu s in th John 
L Hooker mold, while

entertainment, it can't be 
beat. 

For once, a black drama 
doesn't take place in a big 
city ghettD. Mama Rosie's 
family resides in a working 
class su burb, too obviously 
in the Los Angeles area but 
supposedly in Mich igan. 
Men play only a peripheral 
role in the family. The ten-
sions and most of the in-
teraction are between 
three generations of black 
women; Mama Rosie, her 
grown daughters and her 
mother. 

Mama Rosie works in a 
white woman's house to 
support her daughters, and 
lives vicariously through 
her college-educated 
adopted daughter Netta. 
Rosie's own daughters are 
married and live nearby, 
but haven't advanced 
above their mother's social 
position . They hang 
around Rosie's house a 
oat, acting lie the wicked 
sisters in Cinderella. The 
black princess in this case is 
Billie Jean , daughter by 
another man, a dreamer 
who wants to make a 

career as a dancer. 
Neither Mama Rosie nor 

her daughters think much 
of that. Rosie wants an 
educated daughter and the 
sisters don't want to see 
any advancement that 
wouod draw family affec-
tion from them. . 

So the drama unfolds, 
centering on unopened 
and hidden letters, the 
aspirations of Billie Jean, 
jealousy toward the 
adopted college girl Netta, 
and the slow process of 
se lf-awareness as Mama 
Rosie begins to understand 
her own harsh demands on 
those around her . 

Sure, it ' s heavily 
melodramatic . Under 
different circumstances, it 
is a common enough story 
played out in thousands of 
upwardly mobile whit e 
families. The difference is 
that the possibility for up-
ward mobility is sudden ly 
real for blacks, making the 
family conflicts real and 
terribly important. It is 
meaningful now for young 
blacks to see a sister fight 
through those family 

Pure Beefbeart 
Greg Shaw 

"Too Much Time" sounds 
like an Otis Redding album 
track on Stax Records. 

Listening to this album 
makes me wonder where 
Beefheart would be today 
if he had decided to play it 
straight, kept singing blues 
as he was at the start, and 
allowed himself to develop 
in that direction . He 
could've been a brilliant 
songster but he's already 
much more. Yet Beefheart 
is one of music's true 
geniuses; his vision and im-
agination span whole 
categories of mussic; his 
songs are as much jazz as 
rock, and not so much of 
either as they are pure 
Beefheart. 

Even on this album, if 
you get into the most 
ordinary-seeming songs, 
you find little word tricks, 
an insprired po try of Iyri 
every bit up to his previous 
standard. And th r are a 
couple of songs that st ray 
into the weird atona l 
Beefheart universe of hare. 
"Big Eyed Bans From 
Venus"the album's long st 
tra kventur s somewhat 
cau tiously into th bizarr 
but manag s to stak out 
quit a bit of odd t rritory 
in its 4 :23. "Golden Bir-
dies" is a fascinating 

narrative, recited over dis-
cordant and intermittent 
guitar jumbles. 

So there's plenty he re for 
the hardened Beefheart 
fan, as well as for those 
who prefer to be led 
through more familiar land 
on the way to Beefheart's 
world . I doubt if he'll stay 
on this track for long, but 
he' ll likely pick up a lot of 
new followers while he 
does . 

The rock 'n roll revival is 
sure getting to be a pain in 
the ass. That 's a tough ad-
mission to make, as I sit 
here surrounded by my 
25,000 oldies, listening to 
"The Dub s Meet the 
Shells," but I can't dodge 
the painful truth . 

At first it was great just to 
h ar the old songs, but 
now that the originals are 
more widely availabl than 
ever and the revival groups 
have universally failed to 
pick up the spirit of the 
music and progress beyond 
the sam tir d standards, 
th e whole thing is 

,be oming a drag. 
With all that said, it's 

tim to bring forth a r:ou-
pie of exceptions. First, 
from England, a group 
called "Fumbl "s m un-

hassles and jealousy and 
still make it . 

The specific cir-
cumstances of Mama 
Rosie's family a much more 
fluid assembly of relatives 
than exists in a typical 
white sub urban family-
lends particular fasci nation 
to the film for whites. The 
interrelationships, jealousy 
and roleplaying become 
infinitely more com plex, 
and as the web tightens, 
more difficult to escape. 

The struggle for ad-
vancement and the pursuit 
of a personal dream shared 
to one extent o r another by 
all the characters in " Black 
Girl"is a basic human one, 
though segments of the 
white left might be jaded 
about it. That struggle, first 
made individually in the 
family and then collective-
ly, makes all the 
difference; there' s no 
social movement with it. 
" Bl ack Girl" is an old 
fashioned primer on the 
importance or respecting 
yourself. It's a beautiful 
film . 

usually aware of the basic , 
absurdity of rock 'n roll. 
Their album (Capitol ST-
11125 the first American LP 
by and English revival 
group) includes the 
obligatory rockers- faithful 
and earnest ly un-
imaginative versions of 
"Teddy Bear ," " One 

ight," " Rave On" and 
"The Girl Can't Help It"-
but mixed in with them is a 
batch of songs, such as 
Carole King's " It Might as 
Well Rain Until 
September" and Neil 
Sedaka's "Breaking Up is 
Hard to Do," which catch 
the best spirit of the early 
60's every bit as well as 
Elton John's "Crocodile 
Rock." They've got a singer 
who has Sedaka's nasal 
tones down exactly, and it 
makes for a great light-
hearted mood. 

America's latest offering 
is "Flash Cadillac & the 
Continental Kids," in their 
long-awaited debut album 
(Epic KE 31767). They fall 
into the Sha Na Na trap by 
putting corny pictures on 
the cover and sticking to 
close co pies of 
"Muleskinner Blues" and 
"Up on the Mountain," 
but their originals such as 
" Teenage Eyes," " Betty 
Lou" and "She's So Fine" 
prove they could be 
dynamite if they'd have 
more faith in their own 
material. 

Flash Cadillac is a perfect 
example of why the rock 
revival hasn't ac-
com plished much. 
Unwilling to free 
themselves of the trappings 
of revivalism like leather 
jackets and ducktails, they 
are forced into a dying 
musical ghetto where 
nobody takes them or their 
music seriously. I honestly 
believe that anybody 
without preconceptions 

auld listen to Flash 
Cadilla and judge them 
mar exciting and in-
teresting than th e majority 
of what pa s for rock ' n 
roll groups today .

In attempting to meet that 
responsibility, the NORTH 
STAR often prints articles sup-
porting unpopular positions 
and finds itself the target of 
abuse and harrassment . We 
chose to have those letters 
and calls aimed at the NORTH 
STAR and not at ourselves 
personally. Consequently, we 
refuse to print or make 
available a list of contributors 
or staff members. We lose less 
sleep that way. In its failure to permanently quell 

North Vietnamese aggression , the 
United States has suffered the greatest 
defeat in its history. We have betrayed 
allies all over the globe, abdicated our 
responsibility to the enslaved peoples of 
the world, and have lost, perhaps 
forever, our moral status as principled 
defender of the free worldall in ex-
change for a deceitful and temporary 
ceasefire which in no way stands up to 
the challenge of Communism.The 
"peace" of Ho Chi Minh, like the 
"peace" of Stalin and Mao Tse-tung, 
soils our history. 

But surely, this is not cause for sur-
prise. Rather, it is the inevitable result of 
the Liberal ideology which has paralyzed 
our foreign policy for decades. The end 
of World War II saw the United States 
emerge as the greatest, the freest power 
in recorded history; the standard-bearer 
for the rich heritage of Western civiliza-
tion. Simultaneously, the Soviet Union 
came into being as the most barbaric 
and inhumane dictatorship in the world, 
announcing as its eternal goal the 
destruction of the West, primarily 
America, and the global hegemony of 
Communism. Thus was the stage set for 
a battle over the very essence of the 
human spirit; a battle with only two 
tragi c, stark alternatives: victory or 
defeat . 

Yet this was without reckoning the 
domination of Liberal ideology among 
our leaders. The relativist denial of 
moral absolutes, the pragmatist value of 
peace at the cost of freedom, have 
together produced a record of con-
tinuous retreat before the steady ad-

The purge, the slave camp, forced 
starvation, the merciless slaughter of 
tens of millionsthis is the reality to which 
we have closed our eyes and our con-
science, trying to somehow pretend that 
it would go away, or didn't exist, or 
didn'r matter. Tod do anything rather 
than stand up and fight like men, we 
invented the Age of Coexistence, an 
upsidedown world where one toasts his 
executioner, compares modern-day 
Hitlers and their siezures of power to 
George Washington and the American 
Revolution, and counts the years until 
1984. 

Whittaker Chambers is dead, Frank 
Meyer is deadwhere are those who will 
defend the West tomorrow? The "light 
at the end of the tunnel" flickers and 
goes out, leaving only the darkness of 
chaos and barbarismbut all a weary 
nation can do is drug itself with en-
comiums of peace; hoping, once again, 
that this will be the last war. We would 
do well to listen to the words of those 
who have ' gone before usit was 
Theodore Roosevelt, one of the last of 
our great Presidents, who stated: "If 
we seek merely swollen, slothful ea~e 
and ignoble peace, if we shrink from the 
hard contests where men must win at 
Ihe hazard of their lives and at the risk of 
all they hold dear, then bolder and 
stronger peoples will pass us by, and will 
win for themselves the domination of 
the world ." And it was, ironically 
enough, a Communist, La Pasionaria, 
who stated : "It is better to die on your 
feet than to live on your knees." 

Editor: 
I would like to add another 

example of the LA Times' 
non-objective reporting, es-
pecially in matters concerning 
women, to those pointed out 
by Sandy Dijkstra in her letter 
Tuesday, 1-30-73. 

Just one week before (1-23-
73) the fimes published its 
account of the Supreme Court 
ruling on abortion under the 
headline : 

Mothers Given 
limited Right 

To An Abortion 
... displayed prominently as 

the top center headline on 
the front page. 

The use of the word 
'Mothers' instead of 'Women' 
is clearly an editorial position 
since the entire debate over 
abortion has turned on the 
question of when the fetus is 
truly a hum." being or, in the 
techno-Iega listie jargon of the 
day, when it is "viable" or, in 
other words, when a woman 
can be said to be a mother. 

The Times is ev~n using the 
word against conventional 
practice since we do not 
generally call pregnant 
women mothers but say that 
they are becomlnl mothers, 
iust as no father announces 
his parenthood when concep-
tion is verified not in fact until 
the time of delivery. And 
tradition never infers that any 
child has had only a mother 
for the first 9% months of its 
'life'. 

The LA TImes' use of the 

The Scientific Method and 
Theory of Creation 

The 

A.J. Hoff 
Innate in Man is a curiosity about the world around him 

and a desire to explain natural phenomena. From the oldest 
times on he/she (but mostly he, because she had to clean the 
cave and rear the kids) has made theories about how the 
physical world in which we live is put together. A good 
theory should be based on facts . It is not difficult to think up 
a theory about natural phenomena that is logically consistent 
but that has little to do with reality. 

man and the body of known facts : science and as 
unknown facts: GOD. Of course the priest often fou 
easier not to explain all he knew, perhaps for fear that 
would reveal how little his knowledge was (d. your TA), al 
thus the gap was created, separating what was once whol 
science & religion. The latter now became mainly ()LLUU " ___ 
with the "explanation" of unknown relations and unk 
facts, as well as provididng rules of good conduct, a sort 
applied science. It is interesting to observe though, that un 
fairly recently priests still worked on the frontiers of scienc 
thus, at least in their own minds, bridging the gap. 

A new theory has to fulfill at least two requirements: a) it 
should explain known facts as well as older theories; b) it 
should predict new relations between observable quantities 
wh ich can be tested experimentally. Ultimately experiment 
decides whether the new lheory is better than the older one. 
Until such proof is provided, belief in the new theory may be 
called superstitioUS, although it is often guided by a rather 
personal feeling, about the more elegant way it incorporates 
known facts than the older one, or new relations it bears out 
b tw en known facts that were hitherto not realized . 

The first theories conceived by man were, at their time, 
good scientific theories, although people now call them 
r ligions. They e!Cplained known facts logically and convin-
cingly, and some had even predictive power, as when will be 
the next time that the heavenly dragon eats the moon or the 
sun. Gradually, observation I d to the discovery of more 
facts , which were duly incorporated in new theories. Along 
the road, however, common man had lost contact with all 
the facts and a special class of scientists, called priests, was 
instituted. Their task was to form a bridge between common 

From the above It will be clear, that the theory of creatio 
has some credentials. It is at least the oldest physical theo 
and still favored by many religions. It suffers, however, fro 
one serious defect : it lacks the power to predict . Evolutio 
with its more exact branch, genetics, does not lack t~ 
property. Its main defect is that it is very difficult to test 
predictions due to the long time span involved. So in the ~r 
it is mainly a question of taste. If one wants to teach crea\l~ 
as a theory of historical interest and as an alternau 
possibility, go ahead. But it is impossible to present it a! 
modern times rigorous scientific theory. Evolution, on t 
other hand, coin be presented as such, but its "proof" is 
yet based on circumstantial evidence. Since most sclenti 
are engaged in disproving someone else's theory an.,hn'w. 
is a laudable effort and truly scientific to try to 
Darwin. But it should be kept in mind that such activity 
nothing to do with "proving" a "theory" of creation.

Ciao! to Kevin 
William H. Stoddard 

In his column last week, Kevin Olson 
had some harsh things to say about the 
film Claol Manha«an, about modern art 
in general, and about its presumptive 
ph ilosophical underpinnings deter-
minism, materialism, relativism, and 
ni hilism. I haven't seen Ciaol ;\ianhat-
tan, so I don't intend to comment on it. 
But I think that Kevin's evaluation of the 
phi losophy in question leaves 
something to be desired . Conservatives 
and Jesus people have been telling us 
fo r some time that a scientific outlook 
on values is impossible and/or harmful, 
but they haven't offered much proof. 
And, of course, not much is needed in 
many cases. Most of us have grown up 
with the value-orientation which they 
hold let me call it 'religiosity.' Many 
people retain it unchanged : belief in a 
supernatural God, in divine judgement, 
and in absolute moral law Many others 
reject the theology, but keep the morali-
ty, following the path invented by Kant 
and others of his time belief in duty, 
conscience, and moral law as an 
overriding principle by which even God 
might be judged, if he exists. But it 
seems desirable to me to suggest that 
the re is another viewpoint than this. 

Kevin gives the show away by one of 
his references: the idea that man in 
essence is infinite. The mystically In-
cli ned would add, 'by the grace of God'; 
the humanistic would say 'through 
realization of his own powers'. But this 
infinity, made real by participation In 
moral relations with others, is thought 
by them to be possible and desirable. All 
creativity is thought to derive from it, as 
is all love. The religious person, Chris-
tian or agnostic, holds an ideal : the unity 
and equality of all men In unselfishly 
working for one another, and caring for 
one another, under the dominion of 
morality freely chosen by all. And 
whoever does not hold this ideal they 
regard as making himself less than 
human. 

Curiously, every political movement 
for a long time has also held this ideal. 
Religious conservatism; welfare-state 
liberalism; ut ilitarianism; Marxism; 
Tolstoy'S Christian anarchism; British Fa-
bian socialism, Nazism; Fascism; the 
New Left all proclaim that there is a 
moral law, and that men who are outside 
this law, which makes all men one, are 
less than human. Each sect has its own 
moral law, and it own program for 
imposing it from bloodbaths to voting 
to prayer. But they are all moralistic. 
They all believe that men's values come 
from some sphere other than natural 
necessity. They think there is some 
sphere from which comes an inner law 
bearing equally on everyone, deman-
ding realization, which should be the 
ultimate determinant of all values. In this 
sphere, they think, man is infinite, his 
valuing appears as a spontaneous and 
unconditioned expression of himself as 
free agent. Unconditionedness is what 
they all prize above everything else. 
From world-famous philosophers like 
Plato, Kant, and Marx to obscure sects 
like Scientology, this desire is a common 
thread of continuity. 

No scientist, as a scientist, can believe 
in anything infinite, unlimited, or un-
conditioned. To be knowable by science 
in other words, by common sense made 

capable of intelligent self-criticism a 
thing must be possessed of definite 
properties, which are its limits, the con-
ditions which constrain it to finiteness . 
The only thing which has no limits is the 
totality of all existing things for there is 
nothing beyond it to limit it. And no one 
thing wihin this totality is infinite. (For 
that matter, the totality mayor may not 
be infinite; it is simply unbounded.) 
Anything which was infinite would be 
utterly unpredictable and patternless -
and therefore not comprehensible by 
any means of knowledge '!Ve have, as

C· I lao .... continued 'rom p~ge 7 
finite be ings. No r is there any way to get 
beyond our own fin iteness, other than 
si mply assuming ou rselves ,to have done 
so and tryi ng to act as If we we re. 
(Math e maticia ns unde rstand th is in 
terms o f 'constructive' vs. ' nonconstruc-
tive' proof the fi rst kind show how to 
reach a resul t by some fin ite process, the 
second does not do so.) 

Being finite, we are also ind ivid ual. 
Each of us confronts a d ifferen t system 
of natural necessities. Each o f us has a 
d ifferent system of values, e volved out 
of these natura l necessi t ies. The idea of 
d uty, of a unique pe rfect system of 
values, is in essence a mea ns by wh ich 
we are led to stamp ou rselves into a 
un iform mold rathe r than developing 
o ur own fi nite powers. Bu t the re are fe w 
fi nite perspectives from which uniform i-
ty is desirable. A certain beh avioral un-
ifor mity, such as is provide d by a legal 
system, is beneficial, if it's ke pt in the 
status of a means to efficie nt coopera-
tion; comm unities with in which men 
gene rally t reat e ach other fai rl y are 
better places fo r their mem bers to live 

- in. But even this is most effective if it 
imposes the fewest restrictions. (One of 
the great unsolved problems is, how do 
we have a legal system which will remain 
the servant of the people and not their 
master? How do we live so that we shall 
not find ourselves strangled by an un-
controllable excess of law, as in every 
totalitarian state in history?) And beyond 
th is, it is not only not desirable that men 
should be uniform since whether a man 
should be like other men in his actions 
depends on whether he is like them in 
his needs. It is actually undesirable. For 
each of us benefits from the fact that 
others produce goods and services he 
does not produce, gains knowledge and 
explores ways of life other than his, and 
sees him with a perspective not his own. 
Exchange among differing men is what 
makes all our values possible understan-
ding 'values' here as 'personally held 
values'. 

It is finiteness that makes us creative. If 
we were infinite, we would have no 
reason to create; all knowledge and all 
beauty would originate from some set of 

principles we already embocied, by a 
pure ly routine unfold ing . Creativity is 
t h e pow e r to make non routine 
judgements, judgements which are risky 
not ce rta in in advance to be right but 

wh ich turn out to be righ t, or at lesst 
e n lightening. 

It is finiteness wh ich makes us able to 
love. Every good workman loves his 
too ls fo r he needs them; they are part of 
his life, wh ich is h is coping with his own 
fi n ite ness. In the same way, personal 
love is what one feels for thos by whom 
one is he lped in ma intaining and exten-
d ing one's own vision and powers. In 
particular, love is a response to a person 
who hel ps o ne to be creative in one's 
vision of oneself, to see oneself in a new 
light over and ove r. If we were infin ite, 
we wou ld not have any ne~d for 
anyone e lse, and would therefore be 
incapable of love. The atte mpt to love 
out of du ty always manages to reduce to 
a mere fo rmal exe rcise in man ipulating 
wo rds, if to anything that beneficial 
often it's merely an excuse fo r harassing, 
intimidating, torturi ng, or mu rdering 
other people. 

Why, the n, do people try to be in-
finite? I don't know the origin of this 
tendency; it seems like a virus wh ich 
enters minds and turns them ca ncerous. 
(The universe devoid of values wh ich 
some people seem to confront, I un-
derstand as the result of surgically ex-
cising this cancer after it's already eaten 
up everyth ing.) Freud had some theories 
about the origin of this tendency, as d id 
Nietzsche and as does Gary Snyd er, in 
essays such as Why Tribe and Pass.Jge to 
More th.Jn India, dealing with the alter-
natives to civilization. It probab ly 
doesn't have anyone origin . But it has 
one destination . The infi nite is just the 
negation of the finite . Since we are 
wholly finite, we beco me infinite in 
death, and nowhere e'se. The Christian 
puts heaven beyond the grave; the 
Buddhist seeks utter an nih ilation in Nir-
vana, the Marxist o r humanist bel ieves 
that self less devotio n to humanity is the 
best life, and most of all whe n it ends 
with dying to save one's cause. 

As a finite being, I love and celebrate

my own fife my own physical existence 
.Jnd powers, here and now. I am not a 
mor.Jlist, trying to live up to some 
timeless ideal like a shost haunting my 
thoushts. Nor am I an immoralist, goins 
.Jround trying to prove myself beyond 
morality by promiscuity, wanton 
murder, drug addiction, or 
revolutionary violence, as did the Mar-
quis de Sade and the Satanist cults. I 
neither worship God nor parody and 
attack him. He doesn't exist, so I ignore 
him . No perfect moral law exists, so I 
ignore it as well . I merely try to live, 
undistracted by imaginary other worlds. 

the rest has been done by crlmlnah the 
perennial victims of civilization. A Jail Is 
the essence of vlcivlfized society, with all 
idealism stripped away. 

From this perspective, civilization, 
which Kevin so treasures, appears to 'be 
more harmful than beneficial. It has 
historically involved the breeding of 
great herds of human population, for 
labor and warfare, who are tied down on 
peasant farms or herded into cities. Its 
effect is to stamp people into uniformity, 
to take us out of touch with the genetic, 
ecological, motivational, and economic 
necessities which define for each of us 
h is own natural course. Gary Snyder has 
written of the Great Subculture; it con-
sists simply of those people who follow · 
the natural courses, who let things be. It 
was people in this Subculture explorers 
and traders, thousands of years ago who 
first wove the networkk of free 
economic cooperation which civiliza-
tion has taken as its own. Kevin may fear 
outbreaks of violence if civiliz ation 
van ishes; but let him look at history. The 
greatest amount of violece has been 
done by men selflessly following their 
duty to one or another ideal, as all 
vici lized men must do whether the ideal 
was Christianity or Marxism or Nazism 
or loyalty to Nixon 's America . Almost all 

Finally, a word on art. Kevin treasures 
art, he says. But does he realize that all 
tragedy one of the highest forms of art 
is possible only because men are finiter 
When could a man followinS his duty be 
tragic? He would always have to be 
though well off, in that he was being 
moral adhering to a preset hi~hest 
value, which he would surrender 
anything else to anain . He could never 
face any conflict. Tragic conflict comes 
from our finiteness in which we may 
suddenLy discover that what we thought 
our highest values have to be sur-
rendered for new and higher ones. As 
Nietzsche wrote, it recosnizes that in 
the world, living beings will sometimes 
find themselves torn to shreds and that 
life will still survive and flourish, no 
matter what damage is inflicted upon it. 
Even in the most terrible pain, in a tragic 
universe, there is still joy in the mere 
fact of struggling to resist pain and to 
survive. This is indeed a nihilistic view 
but not a defeated nihilism; an ecstatic 
one. And if Kevin thinks nihilism, 
relativism, or determinism deprives the 
univers of values, let him explain 
Nietzsche's Thus Spoke bralhultra, 
Nielsen's Hellos Overture, or even the 
Jefferson Airplane : 

life is change 
How it differs from the rocks 
I've seen their ways too often for my 

liking 
New worlds to gain 
My life is to survive

SCC Shoots 
Down Tritons 

UCSD suffered another setback at t he hands of 
Southern California College by the dismal score of 75-
61 . The Tritons were only down by two at the half, but 
an egregious shooting performance in the second half 
precluded a victory. Another important factor in the 
defeat was the early loss of Triton guard Dave 
Moragne. After scoring eight points in the first six 
minutes of actio n, Dave was involved in an alterr:ation 
with burl y forward Mike Quinn and was subsequently 
banished from the game. 

The only real bright spot for the Tritons was reboun-
ding although SCC was expected to dominate this 
aspect of the game. Pete Henderson and Paul Trainer 
grabbed 15 apiece and Gie Simpson corraled 11 . Gie 
also led the Tritons in scoring with 20 (his high of the 
year) and Paul checked in with 16. 

The Tritons hit the road this weekend for their long 
awaited trip to sunny Bakersfield where they take on 
the Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners. Any of you 
Triton fans who plan to be in Bakersfield for the All-Cal 
belly dancing championships (which coincidentally fall 
on the same weekend) might want to drop in and catch 
the ballgame. 

OMBAC Next Up 
For Ruggers 

The ruggers of UCSD's III team travelled north on 
Saturday to UC Irvine. The Irvine team was inex-
perienced but fairly big and strong. The game played 
womewhat sluggis h'l y in the light to medium smog. 
Throughout the game, the UCSD backs vain ly tried to 
run through 4 or 5 Irvine ex-football players. Finally 
Dick Gregory broke several tackles and batt led his way 
through most of the Irvine club for a fou r-point try . The 
Irvineers came back with two trys an d a conversion 
making the final score 10-4. Dave Wright and Joe 
Simian were both injured ; Dave, separating his 
shoulder after playing a fine game and Joe, earlier in 
the day, wilh a grave knee injury. Jeff Wustman and 
John I-can-drin k-more-than-you-ca n C hristopher. Ex-
cept for a few instances, the game was marked by 
gent leman ly conduct and goou-natu re d play. 

On Saturday, UCSD is schedu led to play the O ld 
Mission Beach At hlet ic Club II and III teams and t he II 
team of Sa n Diego State here at home. Everyone is 
asked to avoid th e fie ld a rea, as lately, the massive 
crowds have grown too la rge to control.

Closely Contested 

Fencers Take All-Cal Tourney 
Well, the marvelously amazing, spilling and thrilling 

UCSD fencing team is now the proud owner of the AII-
Cal Championship. Held on the beautiful and woody 
Sa nta Cru z campus last weed end, the tournament 
included such Western fencing power houses as 
Berkeley, UCLA, and host Santa Cruz. However, these 
UC schools could not quite handle the scrappy and 
skilled intensity which our heroes hurled at them . 
Fighting and struggling over two days, the outcome of 
the meet came down to the final match, and the final 
point of Diane Nafke's bout with a strong contender 
from Santa Cruz. Putting forth a super human effort 
above and beyond the call of duty and to the delight of 
Coach White's failing heartbe at Ms. Nafke came 
through to win the point, match and championship. 
Her sixth place finish gave UCSD one team point and 
e nough margin (one point's worth) to edge out those 
mean old beaus from Berkeley, 48-47. 

Taking nothing away from Ms. Nafke's fine, fine 
cl utch pefformance, we must give equal tribute to the 
other valiant white gladiators (sou nds like a description 
of Sax doesn 't it?) who did an equally fine job. The 
contest began Friday morning with the Foil competi-
t ion. Mike (the Red) Jones, Stan (the man) Robinson, 
and Daryll (Deluxe) Devinny came through with 4th , 
5th, and 6th place finishes, respectively. Their efforts 
earned them the first place trophy in the event and 
were fo llowed by Santa Cruz second, and Berkeley 
thi rd. 

That same afternoon ma rked the beginning of the 
Saber competition. Dashing Dicky Sax led the team by 
finishing third, but he could have done better if he'd 
gotten more of his much-needed beauty sleep. He was 
followed by Stan Robinson and Mike Jones who 
finished fourth and fifth . The team finished second 
overall as Santa Cruz took first and UCLA third . 

After a very together and gratifying stay at Patty 
Neal's home the team ventured back up the hill to the 
campus for the start of the Epee event. Unfortunately 
the festivities of the night before were a little too much 
to handle, because only John (birdie) Helmich could 
place in the top six. He finished second inthe competi-
tion, and lead the Epee squad to a second place finish 
over-all. You mustn ' t, however, blame ali the other 
members for their lapse of concentration during the 
compet ition. After all, they couldn't help but 
remember the sight of the night before as Sax prepared 

Fencers Host 
Own Tourney 

If you walk into the Gym over the weekend and think 
you've walked into an intern's convention well , you 
haven't. You 've stumbled upon the UCSD Invitational 
fencing tournament. Instead of walking out, stay 
awhile, and watch some of the best fencing you'·11 
probably eve r see. And if you happen to be an old 
fencer with a young desire to rattle a few bones with 
the boys sign up . Because anyone connected with the 
University student, faculty, or staff is welcome to enter 
the meet for a nominal cha rge of one dollar and fifty 
cen ts. 

It is estimated that about two to three hundred 
fencers will be on hand to clink, clank and clunk their 
way through the compet ition . Fr iday afternoon will 
mark the beginning of the meet as' the Epee competi-
tion will get under way around 2 p.m. Saturday at 9 a .m. 
the Men 's Foil will begin, followed by the Women 's 
Foil at 2 in the afternoon. Sunday, the final da y of the 
meet, will begin aro und 10 a.m. with the Saber com -
petition . 

Among the schools attending will be stanford, UCLA 
and their forty entrees, USC with their All-American 
fencer Jay Santciair, Berkeley, and the University of 
Arizona . Coach White has also invited the local high 
schools to observe the large meet. 

Happy little plugger Patty eal will once again be 
running the show along with Coach White. Both of 
them may also attempt to do some fenCing depend ing 
on if the mishmash of organization will allow them to 
fig ure out if they are comi ng or going. If you've never 
seen a fen ci ng meet , it's no excuse not to come on over 
to the Gym because handouts will be available at the 
scores table to explain how to watch the meet. And if 
you want to watch your favorite Triton in action, he 's 
the one with the blue patch o n his arm band . So come 
and see the UCSD Invitiational extravaganza and fen-
ci ng tournament, it's more than worth the un price of 
admission .

The final event was the Women's Foil where Diane

Ski Club M ovie 
The UCSD Ski Club is 

proudly presen ting the ski 
flick known as " Earth 
Rider" on February 8 at 
8:30 p.m. at that greatest of 
all tradit ional bijoux, the 
Revelle Cafeteria. "Earth 
Rider" features the in-
c redibly dangerous EI 
Capitan ski jump which 
took place last year (you all 
remember the incredibly 
amazing EI Capita n ski 
jum p don 't you?), and the 
skiing odyssey magic of 
two "endless winter" ex-
perts. 

Know n for his freaky 
stunts, good old "Snake 
lake" Stokes, named after 
a body of Water, did what 
no one else had even 
thought of doing before 
(tis side of suicide) which 
was literally jumping off EI 
Capitan Mountain with 
skis! Rumor has it that he is 
going to try jumping off 
the mountain nest yea r 
with a pogo stick, but that 
is a year and another movie 
away. SKIING, the Sports 
Illustraled of the ski world, 
proclaimed this to be the 
"greatest ski stunt (and 
most dangerous) ever 
pulled off". let's hear it for 
" Snake lake", perhaps the 
man with the most 
cou rage, or least brains 
ever to exist I

Different Strokes 
One has 0 have experienced the frustration of a 

" unknown" sort at UCSD to fully appreciate the turn-
out of eith tfen freshmen. Now you ask yourself, what 
sport could t.,is guy be from to be jazzed over a measly 
eighteen fre r, hmen . We ll , it's Crew. 

To reall y t.omprehend the magnitude of the frosh 
invasion compare their numbers to last years total team 
of fourteen oarsmen and two coxswain. 

Workouts earlier more of a learn ing experience 
because of the number of novices and their late start, 
but now they are becoming the rigorous practice 
session of controlled pain . Every day (morni ng?) the 
improvements can be seen. Coach Gebur rea lly did a 
job up in San Francisco in compiling our schedule. On 
one particular Saturday, April 7, at Mission Bay the 
following teams will be present : UCLA (last yea rs light-
weight champions), Univ. of Washington (72 heavy 
champs), Navy (' nuf said) . long Beach and San Diego 
State (both very strong schools) and the eager Tritons. 
More of the above will occur for the San Diego 
In vi tational, lots more. 

H you have the desire why not prove it, and contact 
the P.E. office for information, everybody'S welcome

Triton Splashers Downed In Dual 
On e of the reasons not 

infrequently advanced in 
the jus tifi cation of athletic 
encou nter is that it 
provides an opportunity to 
meet new and inte resti ng 
(nobody ever mentions 
hopefully beatable) peo· 
pie, in an atmosphere of 
honest, healthy competi· 
tion. Well , we always feel 
badly about exploding a 
myth, but... 

last Friday the TAT 
(Triton Aquatic Truckers, 
remember?) immersed 
themselves in the at-
mosphere of Pomona , 
which certainly strains the 
imagination when con-
sidered "healthy." This im-
plies twice the fun and 
twice the "new and in-
te resting peop·e ." In the 

case of the locals however, 
it meant above all else, 
double the disaster. There 
is some mystic inverse 
relationship between how 
interesting someone is and 
how fast a person might be. 
By the end of the meet, 
Pomona and Oxy were in 
the eyes of T AT, the two 
dullest teams around ... 

The locals attacked with 
a squad of seve n, which is 
much like playing with a six 
man baseball team no 
matter how you look at it 
things are spread a little 
thin . The margarine of 
defeat came mainly from 
the fact that the good guys 
were unable to sp read 
themselves butter among 
the events. Did you really 
digest that sentence?

An indication of the type 
of day it was : We didn't 
even enter the Medley 
relay, diving or the 100 
butterfly, and only had one 
body in 3 other events. 
And in his moment of 
glory, setting a new school 
record in the 200 back, 
Harvey Starcevics only took 
second. 

Despite this, there were 
some highlights. The 400 
free relay team took first as 
did John Ford in the 50 free 
Little Ralph (Valedarez) 
Ausman nabbed 2 seconds, 
along with Hot Rod Harry. 
In the e nd the greatest 
moral victory was the 
margin of defeat which had 
now been narrowed down 
to about 10 from 60 the 
week b for against Cal 

Poly Pomona . (You see, its 
got to be the atmosphere 
up there .) 

A minor excuse might be 
offered for the slow times 
in that right now the 
Tritons are sti ll tearing 
down. That is to say they 
are swimming longer and 
getting yelled at more, now 
in preparation for the big 
test later, commonly 
refe rred to as the peak . 
And we all know it is 
critical to peak at the right 
moment. Now that we've 
had our peak at them it 
remains to be see n 
whether the stimu lation of 
honest, healthy competi· 
tion , and meeting new and 
inte resting (a nd hopefully 
beatable) p eo ple will 
enable TAT to come up 
with theirs.

legislation to prohibit the U.S. Navy from shelling 
and bombing the island of Culebra - the home of 750 
American citizens, all of whom are Spanish speaking · 
has been introduced in the U.S. Senate with Senator 
Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) as a co·sponsor. 

"The Department of Defense made a firm promise 
that the naval sea and air bombardment would stop by 
July 1, 1975, and now the Pentagon appears to have 
backed down on that promise," Cranston said. "1 want 
to see our government's commitment to the people of 
Culebra kept." 

Culebra is a 3-by-8 mi.le island in the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, 22 miles east of the Puerto Rican 
mainland. An uninhabited part of the island four miles 
from Culebra's only town was made a part of the 
Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range in 1936. 

Defense Secretary Melving laird promised thah the 
bombardment would stop on July 1, 1975. He made the 
promise in April, 1971, when the Pentagon released a 
study that condluded that, "alternatives are available 
which coull,l accommodate the Naval Gunfire Support 
training now done at Culebra ." 

As late as November 4, 1972, Secretary laird sent a 
telegram to then Puert Rican Governor luis Fedrre 
reaffirming the commitment to cease shelling by the 
1975 date, Cranston noted. 

" Yet on December 27, 1972, Secretary laird an-
nounced that the practice bombardments would con· 
tinue at least through 1985 and would actually in· 
crease," Cranston said. "The Defense Department 
claims that a later 'classified, study revealed that other 
target areas are not as good as Culebra." 

" 1 agree with former Governor Ferre," Cranston said, 
"that the U.S. government, in Ferre's words, ' has 
reneged on a firm promise .. .' to the people of Puerto 
Rico." 

Over the past 37 years of almost continual bombard-
ment, at least 10 deaths and a number of injuries have 
been attributed to the training activity, accord ing to 
testimo"y given by the U.s. Navy and Puerto Rican 
officials before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 

Puerto Ri can officials also have testified that many of 
Culebra's beaches are not longer safe, homes have 
been damaged, migratory birds no longer nest on the 
island and residents a re constantly being awakened in 
the night by the sound of explosions. 

The bill (S. 156)" which was authored by Senators 
Hubert Humphrey (D., Minn.) and Howard Baker (R., 
Tenn .) would stop naval bombardment of the island by 
July 1, 1975. 

"The people of Culebra have been harassed long 
enough," Cranston concluded . "They should be 
allowed to live in peace without the constant ap-
prehension that now haunts them." 

Ten Days of 
World Affairs 

A ten-day series of lectures on world affairs will be 
held here February 6·15, presented by the National 
Security Seminar team from the Industrial College of 
the Armed Forces in Washington, D.C. 

To be held in luce Auditorium at the U.S. Naval 
Training Center , the seminar will focus on the 
economic, scientific, sociological, political and military 
factors affecting the position of the United States in the 
world today. A team of sic high-ranking officers from 
the Industrial College will conduct the program aimed 
at bringing civ ilian and military participants an 
analytical perspective on world affairs. 

The lecture is open to the general public. For 
information, call the San Diego City of Commerce. 

4th Annual Cyclethon 
Set for March 31 

San Diego County's 4th annual Cydethon will be 
held Saturday, Ma rch 31, taking place from 7 a.m. to 12· 
noon on four courses: Mission Bay, starting at the 
Crown Point Shores parking lot; Heartland, starting at 
the Parkway Bowl parking lot , EI Cajon ; 
Coronado/South Bay, starting at the East Plaza on Sixth 
Street, Coronado; and Rancho Bernardo, starting at the 
Rancho Bernardo Inn parking lot. 

All proceeds from Cyclethon go to help support the 
many student research and educational programs of 
the San Diego County Heart Association, the Children's 
Division of the Arthrit is Clinic at University Hospital, 
and the youth programs of the local chapter of 
American Youth Hostels which teach and promote 

·community projects for bicycle safety. 
Each of four top winners of the 1973 Cyclethon will 

receive a new 10-speed Schwinn bicycle. One bike will 
be awarded to each of four age·categories : 14 years of 
age and under, 15 through 17, 18 through 21, and over 
21. Other exciting prizes will be announced at a later 
date . All riders will receive a certificate for a free Coke, 
courtesy of Coca Cola of San Diego, and a free 
cheesebu rger, courtesy of Jack - I n ot he · Box . 
Applications for the ride are now available by calling 
291-7454. 

Low Blows ... 
continued from pase 3 
of intense sloth (which is, by the ~ay, organic), you can 
tie your huskies to a ten·speed and tool around the 
campus in style. 

Even dogs are now and then victims of exhaustion. 
For this reason, I suggest keeping a chihuahua in your 
back-pack as a spare. 

Once you have organic transportation, parking 
ceases to be a problem. Merely train your animals to 
show up at the right place at the right time so you can 
go where you want . Simply feed them at every place 
you want them to make the scene, at the exact time 
you'll expect them . Bloody beef (available, I'm told, at 
the Revelle Cafeteria) serves this purpose well. Within a 
week you should have no problems. 

From what I hear of Revelle, dogs should be the ideal 
solution since you seem to have so many there . 

All of the animals I've mentioned also produce a 
useful by-product : Organic feces. Besides its usefulness 
as a fertilizer, it can be mixed with d irt or sand to make 
organic modeling clay for the kiddies; and if left 
exposed to the elements, will turn into a white powder 
which can be used for painting when mixed with water. 

Oh, hey, Edl If you're ever in the neighborhood, 
man, stop by and I'll show you my sheep farm . Later l

A conference on The 
Future of the Counter 
Culture, sponsored jointly 
by the School of living 
( nat ion-wi de, head-
quarters : Freeland, Md .), 
and the Coordinating 
Council for Survival 
Research (world wide, 
headquarters : los 
Angeles), will be held 
February 24/25 at the Fran -
cisco Torres Conference 
Center, adjacent to the 
Universi ty of Californ ia at 
Santa Barbara. 

CAMPUS PROGRAMMING BOARD 
presents a 

Drop Oul of the Ral Race 
and Join the Future 

Built around this theme, 
the conference will bring 
together readers of the 
Whole Earth Catalog, the 
Green Re volution, and 
Mother Earth Newsthe 
doers, not the talkerswho 
want to meet and rap with 
others who are operating 
productive homesteads, 
co-ops, communes, inten· 
tional co mmunities. These 
are the self-help pioneers 
of the seventies, who have 
dropped out of the es-
tablishment in order to 
develop alternative life 
styles which better fulfill 
human need. 
Design Your Own 

Conference 
The program is not pre-

packaged. The conference 
will be a do·it-yourself 
demonstration in that 
many of the events and 
activities will be planned 
and arranged on the spot 
by participants. Active 
homesteaders and do-it-
yourselfers will exchange 
their experiences and prac-
tical techniques for living 
the good life in spite of the 
affluent society.
