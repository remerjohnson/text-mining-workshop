UCSD and California Western Law School decided on 
April 6 not to form a UCSD law school in the near future 
due to $60 million in state cuts that the university will face 
next year. 

The on-going discussions regarding the creation of a 
School of Law — a self-sustaining school that does not require 
taxpayer or UCSD campus funding — stalled because the 
addition of staff to UCSD’s pension fund would be a strain, 
even though the new law school would require no new funds.

“The UC system is facing cuts of at least $500 million and 
UCSD of at least $60 million — possibly double that,” Senior 
Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Suresh Subramani said. 
“An infusion of new faculty into the UC retirement system 
would be draining given the current economic climate.”

A joint committee of 27 faculty members and 
administrators from both universities began meeting in 
January 2010 to discuss the chances of a joint affiliation. The 
vision was to create a new UCSD School of Law; California 
Western School of Law would no longer exist. 

“Cal Western is a financially stable school,” California-
Western Law School spokesperson Pam Hardy said. “We have 
been in the black for some time. The merger is self-sustaining. 
The main reason there was a pause was so that UCSD could 
figure out what is best [for the two schools].”

The two schools have existing collaborations, including 
joint degrees, the Community Law Project — a program that 
allows UCSD undergraduates to gain experience by providing 
legal and public policy services for the underprivileged in 
San Diego — and speaker series. Hardy said both schools 
are similar because both have dual J.D./Ph.D. programs with 
UCSD’s History and Political Science departments, as well as 
a joint master’s degree in Health Law.

Should negotiations resume and the committee reach 
an agreement, a proposal will be submitted both to the 
UCSD Faculty Senate and administration and the California 
Western Board of Trustees. If both bodies support the 
recommendations set out in the proposal, it will be sent to the 
UC Office of the President for a final decision. 

Subramani said it is difficult to predict when talks resume.
“This is just a pause,” Hardy said. “This is not a suspension 

or an end.”

warren College junior Alyssa Wing will be the 2011-12 A.S. Council President, after winning by a margin of 874 votes in an election fraught with delays, and which featured one 
of the largest voter turnouts ever recorded. 

“I’m still kind of in the shock stage, because it’s a surreal feeling,” 
Wing said. “Just because you put so much time into the process of 
elections and making sure you’re doing everything you can to get 
yourself out there. And when the results come out, you’re kinda 
shock[ed] that you’re even to that point.”

Of the 30 candidates who ran under Wing’s Board the Wing 
slate, 27 were elected. 

“From the get-go, that was something that I made sure would 
separate us from the other slates,” Wing said. “We were the largest 
slate this election season and, as you know, maintaining anybody is 
difficult, so I made sure that everyone was on the same page, that 
we really had a unified vision and that every member on our slate 
was dedicated to this vision we share.”

The executive board will be composed solely of BTW members, 
all of whom are currently serving on council: Speaker Meredith 
Madnick will be the Vice President of Student Life, Warren Col-
lege Senator Kevin Hoang will be Vice President of Finance and 
Resources and current Transfer Senator Samer Naji will take on the 
role of Vice President of External Affairs.

In addition, seven out of the eight campuswide senators will be 
from BTW, with the sole exception being current Marshall College 
Senator Annie Yu, who ran on Tritons First.

This year’s election featured three new slates, 140 candidates 
and six presidential candidates, including Warren College junior 
Marc Chew, who dropped out on April 3.

A.S. elections use the single-transferable voting system, in 
which voters are asked to rank the candidates in order of prefer-
ence. If a student’s first-ranked candidate is eliminated, her vote is 
transferred to the second-ranked candidate and so on. 

In the final round of the voting system, Wing — who is cur-
rently Warren College Student Council president — won the elec-
tion ahead of Students First! runner-up Jasmine Phillips.

Engineered Protein Lights Up Cells with Green Fluorescence
sCieNCe aND teCHNOlOGY

By Nisha Kurani
Associate News Editor

Researchers have discovered a 
new way to tag and illuminate living 
cells and the insides of animals. By 
modifying a blue light-absorbing 
protein from a small flowering plant — 
Arabidopsis thaliana — scientists were 
able to produce fluorescent, three-
dimensional images of microscopic 
objects via electron microscopes 
(EMs), measuring tens of nanometers.

The project — led by pharmacology 
professor Roger Tsien — follows in the 
vein of the professor’s work with green 
fluorescent proteins (GFPs) in light 
microscopy, for which he earned his 
2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry

Project scientist Varda Levram-
Ellisman said this technique provides 
more detail on microscopic objects 
than other techniques.

“It gives us superior results 
compared to other methods,” Levram-
Ellisman said. “The results are much 
better for visualization and are much 
more precise; you can even see single 
peptide structures.”

According to Tsien, the use of the 
engineered protein — also known as 
“miniSOG” — is useful with electron 
microscopes. The miniSOG is also 
used to locate and identify proteins 
with implications for various diseases. 

“This is a tool that can help address 
many questions,” Levram-Ellisman 
said. “It can answer questions of 
protein localization, how many times 
a protein appears in cells, [and] in 
terms of different diseases, you can see 

accumulation of proteins in specific 
places more than normal.”

The protein works as a genetic tag; 
it latches onto proteins and illuminates 
them to give details of localization and 
structure.

“The proteins of interest are 
carrying around the genetic tag, 
wherever it goes,” Levram-Ellisman 
said. “You can see it in its final 
location, you can sometimes see it 
where it’s degrading, or where it’s being 
generated.”

Using the electron microscope 
helps. Past methods did not yield a 
clear image of fluorescing proteins.

“Our new technique enables us to 
put beacons on just about any protein 
and get a snapshot of its location at 
the much higher resolution of EM,” 
Tsien said.

Researchers used a plant protein 
that absorbs blue light, which triggers 
a cascade of biochemical signals. They 
engineered it to change the blue light 
into green fluorescence and single 
oxygen molecules, which then produce 
a tissue stain.

To locate proteins, the researchers 
confirmed the use of the tag by 
illuminating and locating well-known 
proteins. Tsien and UC San Francisco 
pharmaceutical chemistry professor 
Xiaokun Shu tagged two neuronal 
proteins in mice and identified their 
location in the brain.

Tritons presidential candidate Par-
minder Sandhu said. “It shows that 
they have a tremendous ability to get 
things done. I’ve known [Wing] for a 
long time. She’s going to be an amaz-
ing president.”

Phillips noted that other UC 
campuses also have Students First! 
slates, and said her slate is beneficial 
in establishing relationships with 
other schools.

“We already have the established 
connection and bonds, so I’m hoping 
that next year, [Wing] is able to fa-
cilitate that connectedness,” she said. 

The Students First! slate will have 
three members on council: Biologi-
cal Sciences Senator Randze Palm-
aira, Marshall College Senator Sum-
mer Perez and Muir College Senator 
Elizabeth Garcia. Aside from Yu, Tri-
tons First! will have one other mem-
ber, Revelle College Senator Meena 
Kaushik. 

No members of slates We Are Tri-
tons or Flush the John were elected 
into council.

“I’m pretty happy with the elec-
tion results,” Flush the John presi-
dential candidate John Tran said. “I 
know Alyssa Wing personally, so I 
think she’d do a great job.”

The results were delayed for three 
days as the A.S. Elections Commit-
tee discussed 22 grievances out of a 
total 28 from April 8 to 9, according 
to A.S. Elections Manager Senam 
Payandeh. Students First! filed 10 of 
the grievances.

“As a slate, we essentially wanted 
to process a lot of the other slates 
who weren’t following the election 
bylaws and other rules that the elec-
tion committee and election man-
ager put forth,” Phillips said. “We 
thought that it wasn’t fair for people 
to essentially cheat and not receive 
any type of sanction. [We wanted] to 
hold people accountable.”

In addition, the A.S. Judicial 
Board deliberated seven grievance 

appeals on April 10. Four of the ap-
peals were made by Students First!.

Two of the grievances from Stu-
dents First! accused the BTW slate of 
interfering with voting and having a 
polling station in Muir College, but 
the slate was ultimately not sanc-
tioned.

“The process really revealed how 
much internal reform that we really 
do need,” Wing said. “In terms of 
our rules, we need to ensure that our 
own members [of] the judicial board 
and elections board know the rules.”

Another appeal was filed by the 
pro-University Centers Fee Refer-
endum campaign, which was not 
in favor of the elections commit-
tee nullifying the referendum. The 
elections committee invalidated the 
referendum because University Cen-
ters Director Paul Terzino gave the 
con campaign incorrect numbers on 
the amount of campaign funds they 
could spend. Acting judicial board 
chair Shounak Ghosh said the board 
upheld the committee’s decision.

In another appeal, Graduate Stu-
dent Association representative Garo 
Bournoutian accused A.S. Elections 
Manager Senam Payandeh of being 
biased in favor of the pro campaign 
for the University Centers referen-
dum. Payandeh was not sanctioned.

“Elections this year was an inter-
esting process,” Sandhu said. “Stu-
dents First! grievances were unfair 
— they were long and they didn’t 
have grievances in a timely manner. 
It held up the elections process and 
it seemed as if they were using griev-
ances as a tool for disqualification.”

Judicial board chair Polina Ts-
vetikova said the board focused on 
considering all sides of the appeals.

“There’s been a lot of talk that 
we were favoring one slate over the 
other, and I know it’s hard for people 
to actually understand our perspec-
tive because they weren’t in the room 
with us,” Tsvetikova said.

Payandeh said 27.5 percent of the 

student population — or 7,443 out 
of 27,008 students — voted in the 
election. This is more than last year’s 
student voter turnout of 22.7 per-
cent. Revelle College had the highest 
college turnout at 29.5 percent while 
Warren College had the lowest turn-
out at 25.3 percent. Payandeh said 
the turnout was one of the largest 
ever recorded.

The Canyonview fee referendum 
passed with 3,793 out of 7,376 votes. 
It will charge students an additional 
$10 per quarter to maintain student 
recreation facilities. 

The University Centers fee and 
CPI referendum was invalidated in 
the grievance process because both 
the pro and con campaigns were not 
notified of and did not receive cam-
paign funds from Terzino at equal 
times. 

The fee would have charged stu-
dents an additional $5 per quarter to 
sustain Price Center and Old Student 
Center facilities. Despite the invali-
dation, the referendum would not 
have passed because 54 percent of 
the voters were against it.

Wing said that her first priority, 
before taking office May 6, will be to 
appoint associate vice presidents.

“Making sure that we have ap-
pointments on time and that the 
process is done right, as they have 
not been done in years past [is first 
priority],” Wing said. “First and fore-
most is getting a full council [and] 
ensuring that our appointments go 
well and that we advertise the heck 
out of it.”

Her future goals include increas-
ing the visibilities of council and 
Triton Tide, in addition to a rules 
committee, in light of the grievances 
incident.

Tritons First! presidential can-
didate Ryan O’Rear could not be

This week’s council meeting started off much louder than usual; public seating was 
nearly full (with two seats taken by 
myself, my laptop and the Panda 
Express I didn’t 
have time to eat).

Public input 
began with 
announcements 
from a repre-
sentative from 
the Community 
Law Project  and 
John Condello 
of the Committee on Non-Affiliate 
Speech, who was respectfully asked 
to use gender neutral language by 
Campuswide Senator Elizabeth 
Elman.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Brian 
McEuen’s project “Triton Outfitters 
Mobile” will be selling Sun God mer-
chandise on Library Walk through 
Week Seven.

Social Sciences Senator Rena 
Zuabi and Fred Qafiti of Students 
for Justice in Palestine gave a special 
presentation prefacing a resolution 
that is planned to be on next week’s 
Orders of Business. The resolution 
requests UCSD’s divestment from 
companies such as General Electric 
that they feel are “non-neutral.” The 
presentation attracted a crowd of 
approximately 30 spectators and sup-
porters, some of whom took seats on 
the ground.

Council went into closed ses-
sion to discuss the impeachment 
of President Wafa Ben Hassine. 
Although Ben Hassine was able to 
secure her position, council remained 
in closed session for over two hours, 
which gave me the time to chat up 
California Review Editor in Chief 
Alec Weisman. (My Red Bull was 
wearing off at this point. Ben Hassine 

left the meeting right after closed ses-
sion with flowers in hand.) 

Upon returning to public session, 
council did what it does best: mem-
bers argued particular diction in sev-

eral resolutions, 
amendments etc.

As the meet-
ing hit the fourth 
hour, council con-
tinued to debate 
the word choice 
of single clauses 
and the meaning 
of “principles of 

community.” 
   The ever present Israeli-Palestinian 
elephant in the room was reexam-
ined when Campus-wide Senators 
Anish Bhayani and Elizabeth Elman 
discussed issues of “alienation” and 
their opposing opinions on council’s 
involvement in worldly issues.

AVP of Student Organizations 
Carli Thomas asked council to 
read and ponder the “principles of 
community” when making council 
related decisions.

Council finally entered into the 
New Business portion of the meet-
ing when the two-digit time slot hit 
around 10:15 p.m. 

Muir College Senator Lynne 
Swerhone encouraged councilmem-
bers to speak up in session, which 
she does not shy away from due to 
what she calls her “gigantic testicles.”

Transfer Senator Samer Naji read 
a message from Muir College Senator 
Ryan O’Rear, who  had to leave 
early, in which O’Rear suggested that 
Council “read the fucking order of 
business.”

Elman left the meeting in tears, 
praising Zuabi for her efforts to cre-
ate a resolution to divest non-neutral 
funds and expressed her sentiments 
for those staying on council, remind-
ing them that they are the future.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG/oPINIoNTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2011

Whether you’re 30 seconds late and running back to your car or maybe just 
misread the fine print, nobody wants 
to shell out upwards of $60 for some-
thing as stupid as a parking ticket. But 
don’t worry, the How-to Guru is here 
to help.

The first thing you need to under-
stand before penning a rambling list 
of excuses to the parking department 
(roommate accidentally took your ‘A’ 
permit!) is that there are three levels 
of appeal in the traffic court system: 
written appeals, facility hearings and 
county court. 

Written appeals require you only 
to fill out the form and describe 
why the ticket is invalid in a couple 
hundred words or less (in the case of 
campus parking tickets, there’s a peti-
tion form online).

If you lose the initial written 
appeal, you can still contest via hear-
ing. The hearing is facilitated by the 
institution that wrote you the ticket. 
So, if you got a ticket in Gilman 
Parking Structure, your hearing 
would be with a board of UCSD 
transportation officers. To qualify 
for a hearing, you must first pay the 
entirety of your ticket and, if you win 
your case, the court will refund you 
the total amount. 

If you lose both the hearing and 
the written appeal but still have more 
than a little fight left, you can go to 
county court. In the big leagues, you’ll 
have to pay both your fine and a $25 
court fee. Of course, if you win, you 
get the price of the ticket and the $25 
court fee back, but otherwise you’re 
out the money for both the fee and 
your parking ticket — choose wisely.

The first rule of contesting tickets? 
Check for accuracy. Read and reread 
your ticket. Check the make/model/
year/license plate/color thoroughly. If 
any of that information is wrong, it’s 
a huge point in your favor. Ticketing 
officers’ small mistakes (like writing 
‘blue’ in place of ‘forest green’) allows 
you to build the case that whoever 
wrote the ticket wasn’t paying atten-
tion. If an officer is snoozing on the 
job, it’s more than possible that he or 
she wrote you a ticket for something 
you didn’t do. The trick is to build 
enough reasonable doubt.

Also, officers always put the CVC 
code of the traffic or parking code 
that you violated. Look it up and read 
it thoroughly — make sure that your 
violation fulfills every single aspect 
of the code. If anything is left out, it’s 
grounds for appeal.

But above all, don’t forget that 
you’re the one responsible for the 
burden of proof. Whether or not you 
actually violated the law — unlike 
moving violations — you’re respon-
sible for providing reasonable doubt 
as to why you’re not guilty — even if 
you are. So, don’t focus on pleading 
about your miserable life in court 
(i.e., my hernia exploded all over the 
dashboard and I had to double park). 
Focus instead on the legal aspects of 
your ticket, and why it cannot apply 
to you. 

Over 95 percent of people that 
receive a ticket don’t bother to contest 
them, so while it might be a lot of 
work, in the end, there’s no harm in 
trying.

Just the Ticket

A.S President-Elect

Dream it. Own it. See it.” These are the words that motivated our team dur-
ing the campaign season and will 
continue to drive the Associated 
Students to new heights and con-
tinued success in this coming year. 

As the A.S. President-elect, I 
am humbled and honored to serve 
the UCSD community in this new 
capacity. For this coming year, my 
vision is a council untainted by the 
division of slate politics, a council 
that is diverse, not divisive, and is 
an active and thriving council that 
takes ownership in our positions 
as student representatives. In my 
experience with the Associated 
Students, I have yet to see this 
potential fully realized and I truly 
believe that we have the oppor-
tunity to restore and renew this 
association with our shared vision 
and commitment to bettering our 
university. 

It is time for the Associated 
Student Council to be reignited 
as a powerful voice and presence 

on this campus and with a strong 
foundation of committed leaders, 
I am hopeful that this vision can 
finally become a reality.

My immediate goals as A.S. 
President revolve around internal 
reform and ensuring we have a 
strong base and foundation for an 
effective and efficient year. 

Change must come from the 
inside out and my plan of action 
includes just that.  I will be work-
ing with my executive team to 
develop standing committees 
within the Associated Students 
that will allow for our organization 
to continually build from year to 
year, protect institutional mem-
ory and allow for the Associated 
Student Council to continue to 
thrive and build a legacy of excel-
lence on this campus.

 Some of the committees 
include a Rules Committee and 
Visibility Committee that will 
work all year long to improve 
the most basic functions of our 
council. Our Rules Committee will 
work to ensure we are following 
our own rules and that our rules 
are updated to ensure that they 

work for our council and for those 
we serve. 

The Visibility Committee will 
work all year long to improve 
our visibility and accessibility as 
council members through initia-
tives such as an “Ask A.S.” table 
on Library Walk, working more 
closely with Triton Television to 
produce A.S. video updates and 
council member office hours. It is 
my hope for this council to active-
ly engage with students on the 
issues that affect them directly.

 It is my goal to challenge and 
encourage this new council to be 
a greater resource and increase 
our accessibility as student repre-
sentatives. While I will be asking 
our council members to challenge 
themselves in their capacities as 
student leaders, I also challenge 
you, as the student, to actively 
seek the educational and leader-
ship opportunities provided by the 
Associated Students to become an 
engaged and active community 
member. Working together is key 
here and we cannot do it alone.

The journey ahead of us will 
not be one without challenges. 

With decreasing state aid and the 
threat of further budget cuts, it 
is even more imperative that the 
Associated Students continue to 
battle these detrimental cuts to 
services and educational oppor-
tunities. 

One way we can do this is to 
ensure that we appoint strong 
student representation on the 
campus-wide committees that 
make these decisions and ensure 
that we are providing the educa-
tional resources for students to 
understand how such issues affect 
us. By providing these educational 
tools and resources, we hope to 
empower students to affect change 
as well.

This is just a glimpse of what 
I hope to accomplish in this next 
year, and I hope I have the oppor-
tunity to meet and work with as 
many students as possible. I thank 
you all again for allowing me the 
privilege to serve you all in this 
capacity and I cannot wait for the 
journey that awaits us. 

Individually we are great, but 
together we are unstoppable. 
Cheers to a great year.

Council Must Focus on Building Unity, Visibility

Rebekah DyeR/Guardian

Though a Board the Wing sweep makes it seem like council is poised for unity, 
members should take a hard look at how they got there in the first place. 

Council Hostilities Demonstrate Need 
for Election Reform

After three days of delay, 25 grievances and the frenzied attempted impeachment 
of President Wafa Ben Hassine, the 
results of this year’s unprofessional 
shitshow of an election are finally in. 

With enthusiasm, coordination, 
balloons and even puppies (eat your 
heart out, Flush the John), Alyssa 
Wing’s Board the Wing slate has 
made the cleanest election sweep in 
recent memory, taking every execu-
tive position and all but one campus-
wide senatorial position. 

The results, at least, bode well for 
the future of council. Wing, always 
a frontrunner, has proven herself an 
effective campaigner, and with the 
rest of her colleagues in office, she 
won’t be plagued by the divided coun-
cil that has paralyzed Ben Hassine’s 

term. 
Ben Hassine, who ran on Students 

First! last year, had very few slate run-
ning mates on council and battled 
opposing opinion at every turn, start-
ing with the scrutiny of her associate 
vice president appointments less than 
four weeks into her term. 

With the leadership ability that 
Wing has already demonstrated, and 
the support of the most powerful 
members of our local bureaucracy, 
it’s likely that this unified council will 
go a long way toward Wing’s goals 
of strengthening athletics, making 
the move to Division-I sports and 
increasing student involvement. 

But for anyone who sits on 
council in the future, this year’s elec-
tions won’t be remembered for the 
big promises or even the 1:30 p.m. 

Monday results announcement at 
Round Table. They’ll be remembered 
by the hours anxious candidates spent 
holed up on the fourth floor picking 
fights and trying to find loopholes to 
reveal the results earlier. 

It’s this process — and the divi-
sions that grew out of it— that show a 
need for Wing, and members of every 
slate, to reevaluate their promises of 
unity, professionalism and account-
ability. 

Many of the grievances were filed 
by the Students First slate, the people 
who conspicuously had the wid-
est ideological gap from the Board 
the Wing, Tritons First and We Are 
Tritons slates. The volume of griev-
ances (and consequent appeals) led 
some candidates to feel that the SF 
slate was trying to disqualify them in 

order to increase their own chances of 
winning, as happened in 2003 when

Dear Editor,
Welcome ASU! 

     In the Monday edition, an open 
letter was published by 28 faculty 
members associated with Scholars 
for Peace in the Middle East, call-
ing upon student organizations who 
organize the Justice in Palestine 
Week to change their agenda to one 
promoting global justice and an end 
to oppression in the Arab world. 

The letter called for a change 
of hearts and long-lasting peace 
where all religions and nations can 
live side by side, recognizing each 
other’s traditions and right to exist. 
The letter was strongly worded and 
unfortunately offensive to some. 

     But a great thing has happened. 
Story tells about Samson, who 
posed a riddle to the Philistines 
after killing a lions and seeing a 
hive of bees making honey settle 
in his carcass: “Out of strong came 
something sweet.” So do we wit-
ness something sweet here — in 
its Thursday response, ASU aligns 
itself with the mission of Scholars 
for Peace, namely “to develop effec-
tive responses to ideological distor-
tions, including anti-Semitic, anti-
Zionist and anti-Muslim slanders.” 
     Witnessing current turmoil and 
historical conflicts in the Middle 
East from academic, civil and 
humanitarian perspectives, we want 
dialog and discussion as befitting 
an academic environment, not 
confrontation, nor religious impli-
cation. 

We welcome all fellow peace-
seekers and look forward to positive 
discussion.

THe MenTal fisHbowl By Alex Nguyen 

Grievances and Internal Strife Make For a Poor Start
the entire Students First slate was 
disqualified. 

It is frustrating, of course, for 
anxious candidates to wait so long 
— and seemingly needlessly, as none 
of the results or appeals resulted in 
disqualification — for the results 
to be announced. And when griev-
ances are filed over such trivial 
squabbles as the absence of “Vote on 
TritonLink” on a campaign poster, 
it is understandable that many were 
so irate. 

If anything, the whole debacle 
shows that the election bylaws are 
worth reevaluating; while some 
grievances, such as the one against 
the now-failed University Centers 
fee, had significant results, it is 

unlikely that omitting “TritonLink” 
on a few posters had much impact. 
More stringent guidelines on how 
long the elections committee or judi-
cial board is expected to stay, and 
more training for all involved, would 
have prevented much of the delay. 

There’s little doubt that there’s 
a lack of organization in how the 
elections run, and that some of the 
guidelines need to be changed. But 
while the rules are there, and while 
the candidates agreed to adhere to 
the rules, every slate has the right to 
file grievances and go through the 
appeal across as they see fit, even if 
others think it unnecessary. For can-
didates to stress accountability and 
transparency within council — and 
then try to impeach Ben Hassine in 

order to see the results faster — is a 
blatant display of hypocrisy and, had 
Board the Wing not so unequivo-
cally won, would have set next year’s 
council up for disaster. Even worse 
is the harassment among opposing 
slates, through hateful comments 
both online and on some candidates’ 
doors.  Come seventh week, when all 
the new members of council take the 
floor, it will be easy for this group of 
running mates to forget the stress of 
the past week. 

But if these members want to 
be truly effective and represent the 
student body as they promise, they 
need to look internally first, keep in 
mind those two days spent on the 
forum and ask themselves how they 
can prevent that in the future.

D ue to my friend’s incessant reminders, I am well aware of the fact that Coachella Valley Music 
and Arts Festival is this weekend. And 
no, I’m not going.

I know I should be upset about 
this. My friends look at me with such 
pity when I humbly mention, in the 
middle of their periodic Coachella 
countdown cheer, that I still haven’t 
managed to find a ticket. But I really 
don’t think I care anymore.

There’s certainly nothing wrong 
with Coachella this year; the festival 
sold out in record time — less than a 
week after tickets went on sale. Clearly 
the people over at GoldenVoice, the 
organizers of the concert, are doing 
something right.

So I’m faced to admit it: Coachella, 
it’s not you, it’s me.

Last year, when the festival sold out 
I almost cried. (OK, I cried). I had to 
resort to prowling Craigslist for a few 
days to get a ticket, and thankfully, I 
found a fellow student who was hon-
orable enough to charge me regular 
price (I know others who weren’t so 
lucky and showed up to Coachella 
with over-priced fake tickets). I even-
tually made the expedition to Indio 
and had an awesome time camping 
and dancing in the desert. So I guess I 
could have the whole “been there done 
that” syndrome. But who knows?

It might just be spring fever, but I 
feel like I’ve lost my desire to discover 
new music. There was once a time 
when I’d care that I’m missing out on 
the Strokes this weekend. Now I sit 
high atop my tower of a desk chair 
every day, staring out at the computer 
screen below me, unable to decide 
what to play on iTunes. 

I worry that I’ve become an apa-
thetic douche. After all, I have been 
writing a bit too much like Holden 
Caulfield lately. Coachella is for pho-
neys! I’m superior. Gah.

I’ve been consciously or subcon-
sciously avoiding all artists on the fes-
tival lineup (though I’m dying to see 
Robyn and love to blast “The Girl and 
the Robot” in the newsroom. I’m still 
crossing my fingers that she’s somehow 
headlining the Sun God dance tent). 

As a result, the artists I’ve been 
repeating on my iPod are decidedly 
anti-Coachella; Led Zeppelin and 
Miles Davis are clearly not playing 
the Mojave tent this year, and the 
new Britney album would make most 
festival-going hipsters roll their eyes 
(but it’s so good!).

 I can’t help but think that my 
apathy is just a depressing extension 
of my true despair. Underneath my 
collected demeanor, I’m jealous of 
everyone who gets to enjoy three days 
of music underneath the desert sun. 
Because even if I’m finding myself 
exceptionally bored with the blog 
favorites of the world, there’s still an 
addictive thrill in finding a promising 
new artist.

When Coachella passes — and 
therefore my resulting indifference — 
I might be down to go to a show with 
you. For now I’m going to continue 
to judge my music collection with the 
finest possible toothed comb, and save 
a ton of money.

thEatrEPREVIEW

I n “Indiana Jones,” Harrison Ford’s eponymous character dodges boulders, escapes Nazis and nearly falls off cliffs — all while holding on to his beloved fedora. 
In fact, in the most classic Indy scenes, the archae-

ologist appears to prefer danger to the prospect of 
losing his hat. But such a reaction is understandable: 
His hat is pretty damn cool.

But what if Indiana Jones had chosen his fedora 
over his woman? His headwear would not be merely 
a stylish means of protecting his scalp — it would 
become a character itself, a worthy competitor to the 
affection of real human beings. 

Leave it to the UCSD Theatre and Dance 
Department’s MFA candidates to bring that twist to 
life. Every spring, the MFA students in playwriting, 
directing, acting and design work together to create 
new plays for the Baldwin New Play festival (run-
ning until April 23), and — as the future pioneers 
of the theatre industry — the artists choose to break 
convention.

Hence the dude and his hat. 
Joshua Brody, the director of “A Man, His Wife 

and His Hat” — a comedy written by MFA playwright 
Lauren Yee — thinks the festival is a great opportu-
nity to witness emerging artists, especially for those 
who aren’t already familiar with the work of UCSD’s 
graduate theatre department.

   Dodging the      
Horizon

MFA candidates collaborate on annual Baldwin New Play Festival, where fedoras and 
the devil reign supreme. By Arielle Sallai • Hiatus Editor

HANG ON TO 
YOUR HATS

“There is so much great theatre happening 
right here on campus,” Brody said. “As new plays 
tend to be, these are a great starting place for sea-
soned theatergoers and newcomers alike.”

Production begins once the playwrights fin-
ish their scripts Fall Quarter. The plays are then 
workshopped by directors; rehearsals begin after 
auditions at the end of Winter Quarter. 

For Brody, the production process has been 
exceptionally rewarding. 

“I can say with complete confidence and sin-
cerity that this has been the most fulfilling artistic 
collaboration of my life,” he said.

The other directors feel the same way. Like a 
summer camp production, the process has been 
entirely collaborative, with MFA candidates par-
ticipating in every aspect.

Anthony Luciano, the director of the Krista 
Knight-penned “Salamander Leviathan,” a self-
described “casio-pop” style musical about what 
happens when an optimistic man is confronted 
with the devil, believes the play will have a life 
after the Baldwins.

“None of us think this is going to be the last 
time we do this play together,” he said. “It’s cool 
to be part of something that you think will move 
forward.”

The same optimistic atti-
tude has tamed the direc-
tors’ traditional pre-show 
jitters.

“It’s funny; I know I 
should be nervous,” Brody 
said. “Normally by this 
point in a process I’m hav-
ing anxiety nightmares … 
over the prospect of open-
ing night approaching. This 
time? With ‘A Man, His 
Wife and His Hat?’ I feel 
an overwhelming sense of 
calm. I have complete trust 
in everyone who’s working 
on the project, so it just feels 
like it’s going to work out.”

If anything, the content 
of the plays themselves are 
varied enough to entertain 
audiences of all kinds. 

Larissa Lury’s “Small 
Prophecies,” written by David Myers, deals with 
the trials of parenthood and growing up. The 
director describes it as “a 14-year-old boy, his 
friends, his parents and an incident of some con-
sequence.”

Lury said that the powerful story has the capac-

ity to reach a wide variety of theatregoers. 
“I would say it is about trying to be who 

you are in the world, and whether or not 
you want to be that person once you think 
you’ve discovered who that is,” Lury said. 
“And whether or not you have any choice 
either way.” 

“Salamander Leviathan” is like the rau-
cous brother of the bunch. The play is a 
rock ‘n’ roll musical, with tunes written by 
Arkansas native Barry Brinegar. 

The composer, who also leads the band 
David’s Pegasus, penned music that direc-
tor Luciano believes is “loud, fun and 
really earnest.”

It’s the first musical Luciano has 
directed, though music has still found 
a place in his previous work. (A vet-
eran of Shakespearean theatre, the director 
sneaked live music into his production of 
“The Tempest.”)

Even though the play sports some 
familiar traits — the delta-blues score and 

sell-your-soul-to-the-devil narrative — Luciano 
says that it also reflects the state of the world today 
(all with a “super hot” cast).

“The play proposes a question that is really 
pertinent right now. It feels like the world is a little 
strange… it feels as if any sort of positive change is 
impossible,” Luciano said. “I think the play is really 
surprising because it remains hopeful. But it’s not 
in any way adolescent or idealistic. It recognizes 
that change is still possible but it recognizes that it 
comes at a great cost.” 

Brody’s “A Man, His Wife and His Hat” — a 
feel-good story intended to emphasize the value of 
human life — is lighter-hearted.

“Our play is like a hug, a really great hug,” 
Brody joked. “Only maybe you were crying a little 
before it hugged you. And then it hugged you and 
you cried onto its shoulder a little. But then you 
started laughing. And then you laughed really 
hard. All while it was hugging you. And then it let 
you go and you just felt better about the world.” 

Amidst the laughs and fedoras, Brody promises 
plenty of introspection. 

“It’s also a play about love and the search for 
yourself,” he said. ‘These are important things, 
lest we forget. I’m a hopeless romantic in many 
ways, and this play satisfies both my need for the 
importance of love and the snarky comedy of the 
‘Family Guy’ era.”

I n the heart of Brazil, soccer, bossa nova music and warm weather reign supreme. The makers of birdie-flick “Rio” embrace 
this stereotype with open arms (and wings): 
the film’s 3-D imagery glitters with phospho-

rescent reds and electric 
blues; most scenes are 
flooded in a perpetual 
sunlight.

The animation shines 
in the film’s opening scene 
especially — rainbow-col-
ored birds burst into up-

tempo song, contorting into a kaleidoscope 
of shapes as we’re first introduced to a young, 
flightless Blu (Jesse Eisenberg). Though the 
young macaw soon finds himself in dire 
straights, he’s rescued by lovable book nerd 
Linda (Leslie Mann) and ends up living in a 
snow-coated town in Minnesota. 

But when dorky Brazilian researcher Tulio 
(Rodrigo Santoro) comes to Linda’s book-
store to inform her that Blu is one of the last 
of his kind — one of two, in fact — the duo 
head for Rio to introduce Blu to feisty female 
Jewel (Anne Hathaway) in hopes of kindling 
a romance. In Rio, the feathered friends are 
birdnapped by smugglers and chained togeth-
er, forcing the unlikely team to work together 
(and around Blu’s flightlessness) for freedom. 

Understandably, “Rio”’s strongest scenes 
are in its titular tropical paradise, where the 
“Ice Age” filmmakers play with the city’s 
charismatic culture and dynamic countryside. 

Characters burst into hip-shaking Latin song 
— Jamie Foxx and will.i.am each get a chance 
to showcase their vocal prowess as goofy 
bird sidekicks Nico and Pedro, while Jemaine 
Clement of “Flight of the Conchords” lends 
his voice to the bad-bird-in-chief, Nigel. 

The trio performs the bulk of the sing-
ing work (occasionally joined by an angelic 
Hathaway) crooning the screenwriter’s clever-
ly-penned lyrics. 

“He’s a suspicious bird,” a group of birds 
twitter about Nigel in guitar and maraca-
infused “Nigel’s Song.” “Who said that about 
me? I’ll have you rotisseried!” he fires back 
nastily — exemplifying the playful back and 
forth strung throughout the movie’s songs, apt 
for the lighthearted and humorous children’s 
movie “Rio” aims to be.   

Not to be outdone, “Rio”’s graphics team 
amps up the visuals —  audiences are treated 
to bird’s-eye views of the Brazilian Carnival’s 

glowing floats, as the native’s costumes reflect 
glittering shades of topaz, emerald and ruby 
reds, lighting up the movie theatre’s dark inte-
rior. Each scene flows seamlessly from one to 
the next without the common 3-D induced 
vertigo that 2-D proponents often complain 
of. 

Though the script suffers from moments 
of kiddy-cartoon cliché (is happily ever after 
really ever an uncertainty?), the cast makes up 
for lost ground with their fervor — Hathaway 
is unrecognizable as butt-kicking Jewel, spit-
ting her lines with ferocity, while George 
Lopez’s easygoing toucan Rafael provides 
some much-needed contrast to Eisenberg’s 
over-anxious Blu.

And though the movie may not soar when 
compared to emotional Pixar Goliaths like 
“Up,” “Rio” is anything but flightless — once 
the samba music kicks in and the beat drops, 
it takes off with flying colors.

C ult rockers Thursday have long been stalwart residents of the post-hardcore scene with their familiar mix of caustic instrumentation and 
crisp, screaming vocals. But on No Devolución — 
the band’s sixth studio album — the New Jersey 
outfit aims to incorporate a darker, more melodic 
approach, marking a significant shift from their 
earlier albums without compromising their distinc-
tive style. The result is an intriguing blend of som-
ber instrumentals and powerful vocals that deliver 
a welcome revamp of the genre.

Opening track “Fast to the End” immediately 
recalls Thursday’s earliest work, with its distorted 
wall of guitars punctuated by desperate drum fills. 
But the album soon steers into more melancholic 
territories, piling layers of moody atmospherics 
under frontman Geoff Rickly’s emo lyrics. 

The new formula’s most radically epitomized 
by “Empty Glass,” whose dramatized and haunting 
melodies are infused with such emotion (by way of 
Rickly’s polished crooning) that the track achieves 
near tear-jerking poignancy.

The rest of the album mixes both the old and 
new aspects of Thursday’s expanded musical rep-
ertoire, interspersing abrasive guitar pieces and 
episodic screaming with softer, accessible key-
board compositions and gently whispered verses. 
The transitions between disparate instrumental 
approaches are skillfully traversed, most notably on 
epic closing track “Stay True,” which steadily builds 
from a mellow intro toward a  frantic climax, com-
plete with impassioned screaming that harkens 
back to Thursday classics “War all the Time” and 
“Signals over the Air.” 

Thursday may be evolving from traditional 
post-hardcore, but they clearly haven’t forgotten 
their roots. No Devolución triumphantly reestab-
lishes the band’s fading relevance in the crowded 
screamo scene.

D espite his age, Dave Grohl doesn’t act like your typical Cristal-and-
coke-in-the-limo veteran 
rock star. Even after 17 years 
with his hugely popular 
Foo Fighters, it’s difficult to 
imagine the goofy, wide-eyed 
42-year-old trailblazing ’90s 
grunge in one of the most 
legendary rock bands of all 
time. 

And while the half-
serious persona has allowed 
Grohl to operate outside 
Nirvana’s impossibly wide 
shadow, his attempts at 
meaningful, sophisti-
cated songwriting (i.e. Foo 
Fighters’ last three albums) 
have consequently felt forced, 
preachy and far too often, 
dull. 

On Wasting Light — Foo 
Fighters’ self-proclaimed 
back-to-basics album — the 
band embraces the ram-
shackle adolescence of their 
early recordings, churning 
out 11 tracks of direct and 
infectious pop rock. 

It’d be easy to mistake 
Wasting Light for a debut 
effort. Recorded with analog 
equipment in Grohl’s garage, 
the production is humble 
and raw. Grohl appears 
hyper-focused on delivering 
hard-hitting riffs (the urgent 
strumming of opener “Bridge 

Burning”) and sweaty, teen-
age anthems (the head-bang-
ing Jovi-esque closer “Walk”). 

Grohl’s vocals, no longer 
crisp and larger than life, 
float in a damp and intimate 
choral mix, recalling the 
fever-dreaming college rock 
of 1997’s breakthrough The 
Colour and the Shape.

When he isn’t busting a 
lung on instant Foo classics 
like catchy-as-hell “Back 
and Forth” and the surpris-
ingly poignant “These Days,” 
Grohl flips through his ’90s 
yearbook of rock influ-
ences — everything from 
SoCal hardcore punk on 
“White Limo” to devastating 
Pixies loud-quiet-loud on 
“Arlandria.” In this hom-
age, the Foo Fighters finally 
feel at peace, freed from 
the shackles of major label 
expectations, playing only 
what they know and so obvi-
ously love. 

It’s a difficult feat for any 
mainstream band to tap into 
not only the sound, but also 
the songwriting mentality, 
that managed to turn heads 
almost two decades ago — 
and on Wasting Light, the 
Foo Fighters seem to be hav-
ing a hell of a time doing just 
that.

I t’s refreshing to see, in the aftermath of mas-sive James Blake hype 
(and subsequent backlash), 
the emergence of someone 
like Jamie Woon. Though 
several artists have skillfully 
combined dubstep with pop 
music in the past (Blake, 
along with artists like the 
xx and Katy B, number 
among the most notable), on 
Mirrorwriting, Woon intro-
duces a nostalgic spin on the 
genre, blending smooth UK 
garage drums and sculpted 
atmospherics with daring, 
early-millennium main-
stream pop hooks.

Make no mistake: When 
critics say that Woon’s songs 
are poppy, they aren’t talk-
ing about barely-hummable 
Blake ballad poppy; they’re 
talking wailing, unabashed 
boy-band melodies. Woon’s 
voice does, after all, bear 
a certain resemblance to 
‘N Sync alumnus Justin 
Timberlake. And like JT’s 
mid-Aughties pop opus 
Future Sex / Love Sounds, 
Mirrorwriting incorporates 
silky vocals and relentlessly 
catchy melodies into excep-
tionally well-produced elec-
tronic music. 

Standout single “Night 
Air,” produced by electro 
giant Burial, pairs Woon’s 

refined croon with crisp 
two-step drums and a deep, 
serpentine post-dubstep bass 
crawl. Similarly meticulous 
production can be found on 
“Middle,” which contorts 
Woon’s voice into a sleek, 
airy background sample. 
The track also boasts one of 
the album’s most indelible 
melodies: Woon wails that 
he “can’t get enough of your 
love” with all the conviction 
of any ’90s R&B star. 

R&B vibes are further 
explored on the smoky 
“Spiral,” which bears the 
kind of echoey acoustic gui-
tar chords one might expect 
of an early TLC record. 
Elsewhere, tracks like “Lady 
Luck” and “Street” keep in 
line with old-school UK 
electronic sounds while still 
retaining the nighttime dub-
step sheen of the rest of the 
album.

By straddling the line 
between underground elec-
tronic and ultra-polished 
mainstream songwriting, 
Mirrorwriting successfully 
taps into the distinct appeal 
of both. It’s a fascinating 
pursuit, and also one herald-
ing one of this year’s artists 
to watch.

TV on the Radio has returned in good form after a string of highly 
touted albums including the 
phenomenal Dear Science and 
Return to Cookie Mountain. 
On Nine Types of Light, TV 
on the Radio continues to 
deliver their patented soul/
funk/art-rock mélange, while 
exercising a more accessible 
method that would even 
please casual listeners.  

The larger, spacier sound-
scape that the band flirted 
with on 2008’s Dear Science 
is fully realized this time 
around. The smooth, atmo-
spheric electronics are felt 
more often than heard — an 
indication that the band has 
become much more comfort-
able with nuanced production 
over the past decade. 

Vocalist Tunde 
Adebimpe’s soulful vocal 
range is prominent through-
out, and while his unre-
strained falsetto may be his 
most distinguishable tool 
(the delicate yet emotional 
croons of standout “Keep 
Your Heart”), he at times 
approaches the self-indul-
gently poppy. The band has 
clearly become keen on pro-
ducing hook-happy choruses 
that stray from the divisive 
experimentation of its past, 
and more toward a somewhat 

unconventional strain of 
radio rock.  

Nine Types truly shines, 
however, from a produc-
tion standpoint. Multi-
instrumentalist and super 
collaborator David Sitek’s 
technical prowess steers the 
band into brave new terri-
tory, employing an arsenal of 
unconventional sounds from 
the gently picking banjo on 
“Killer Crane” to the warm 
brass of the horn section that 
supplements the album from 
beginning to end.

Yet while the album 
boasts some inventive heavy-
hitters in “Second Song” and 
“Will Do,” other tracks come 
across as undeveloped Dear 
Science B-Sides. “Forgotten” 
struggles to land a strong 
hook while “New Cannonball 
Blues”’s murky repetition 
becomes increasingly dull as 
it approaches the five-minute 
mark.  

But the misfires are scarce 
and forgivable, eclipsed by 
the expected grooves of one 
of the preeminent boundary-
pushers in modern music. 
Nine Types of Light manages 
to narrow TV on the Radio’s 
boundless scope without 
abandoning the band’s infec-
tious, time warping aesthetic.

SPORTS THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

first of four hat tricks on the weekend 
from freshman utility Sarah Lizotte, 
the Tritons fell to 7-2 at halftime and 
the deficit was too much to overcome. 
Though they played stronger defense 
in the second half, the Tritons did not 
generate the offense to stage a come-
back, and fell to 0-15 this year against 
ranked opponents.

Later on Saturday, the Tritons had 
a rematch against Santa Clara; UCSD 
scored a 12-10 decision earlier this 
season at Canyonview. The Broncos 
took an early lead in a low-scoring 
first half, holding a 3-2 halftime lead. 
But the Tritons came back and scored 
consecutive goals in the third quarter 
to take their first lead before Santa 
Clara could reply with a goal of their 
own to even the score at 4-4. In 
the fourth quarter, both teams scored 
back and forth until the score stood 
at 7-6 in favor of Santa Clara with 
just under a minute to play. When 
UCSD seemed to be running out 
of options, Lizotte stepped up and 
scored her third goal of the night to 
force overtime. 

Santa Clara struck first and early 

and held a one-goal lead throughout 
the extra period. With 43 seconds 
remaining on the clock, freshman 
hole set Melissa Bartow scored to 
force sudden death overtime. In sud-
den death overtime, senior attacker 
Felicia Orozco was the first person 
to find the back of the net for either 
team and drilled home the 9-8 over-
time victory for the Tritons.

“We started off against San Jose 
State which was ranked seventh in 
the nation,” Kreutzkamp said. “And to 
come back against Santa Clara, I was 
really happy with how we pulled out 
that sudden death victory.” 

In their first game on Sunday, the 
Tritons played a competitive match 
against Colorado State University. 
Playing at 8 a.m., the Tritons came 
out snoozing and fell into an early 
4-2 hole at halftime. In the past, the 
Tritons have struggled when playing 
from behind, but they pulled together 
and shut out the Rams in the third 
quarter while scoring four of their 
own. 

Lizotte again went on the ram-
page, scoring three goals to lead the 
way for the Tritons. 

“We’ve put her in a spot in the pool 
where she is able to either drive and 
sit in front of the cage and do what 
she can do naturally, or drop back 
on Bates and Melissa; she takes those 
outside shots,” Kreutzkamp said. “We 
put her in that role position.”

After the Tritons took advan-
tage in the third quarter, they held 
their lead and refused to allow the 
Rams back into the contest, outscor-
ing Colorado State 4-2 in the fourth 
quarter and swimming with the 10-6 
victory.

“We came back in two of our 
games, against Santa Clara and 
Colorado State,” Kreutzkamp said. “I 
wish I had a magical answer for how 
I get them to come back. It requires a 
lot of pushing and trying to get them 
fired up. We make some adjustments, 
but a lot of our game plan all year 
has been to soften up our opponents 
early. We’re really tiring them out, 
because a lot of times we can just 
outlast the other team.”

On Sunday, the Tritons handily 
defeated Cal State San Bernardino. 
Lizotte — who is taking a larger role 
as the season progresses — scored 
three goals in the game and senior 
attacker Hanalei Crowell matched 
the effort with three goals of her 
own. UCSD took advantage early, 
with a 3-2 first quarter lead and never 
looked back, as the Coyotes trailed 
the whole game. The Tritons swam 
away with the 11-6 victory and their 
guaranteed spot in conference.

The Tritons stand at 14-16 over-
all and have only two games left to 
play in the regular season before 
the conference tournament. UCSD’s 
senior day will be Saturday, April 16 
at noon at Canyonview Pool against 
Michigan, and it will be the team’s last 
home game of the year. The Tritons 
will then travel to take on local rival 
San Diego State Friday, April 22.

Two More Matches Until CCAA Championships The Cavaliers in the D-League?
egation is often more exciting than 
the title chase, and every game is 
important until safety is guaran-
teed. Even casual fans will tune in 
to see a game between two bottom-
of-the-league teams when each is 
in a do-or-die situation. Next to 
nobody would watch a Cavs vs. 
Timberwolves train wreck in the 
final weeks of the NBA season.

There are obvious negative con-
sequences of this system as well, as 
some teams bounce back and forth 
between leagues and constantly 
face different financial prospects. 
This system also does not have 
playoffs — the team with the most 
points at the end of the season is 
named champion — which is cer-
tainly not something I would be 
willing to give up. 

Nevertheless, the thought of 
the Cavs players fighting as hard 
as they can to avoid the embar-
rassment of being relegated to the 
D-League is intriguing. In the land 
of guaranteed contracts, giving 
every team something to play for 
would be great for fans. 

Of course, this wouldn’t be 
realistic, as there simply isn’t 
enough talent to support it. A 
D-League team or minor league 
hockey team could never com-
pete in the top league. In the long 
run, it destroys parity and ensures 
only a few teams can win a title 
in a generation. But it does make 
for a wild ride every season, and 
there certainly aren’t players on 
the bench in street clothes or any 
halfhearted efforts as the season 
winds down. 

CCAA Tourney Next for Triton Golf
the winner after a rough final round. 
Smith finished at 13 over, Okasaki 
finished at 16, while freshmen Simon 
and Anubhav Rastogi tied at 22 over 
par.

“We get the green there unbeliev-
able fast, so that not only do you 
have to be a good putter,” Wydra 
said, ”You have to be able to plan and 
manage your game well.” 

“I came up with some good shots 
when I needed them and I came 
up with good putts when I needed 
those,” Okasaki said. “I kept it togeth-
er and just held on.” 

Smith scored 238 for a 24th place 
finish, Simon finished at 243 and 
Williams scored 249. 

At the Cal State East Bay Pioneer 
Shootout on March 7-8, Simon was 
the top finisher for UCSD with a 
25th place finish. He was followed 
by Okasaki and Rastogi, who tied 
for 30th, and Williams received 54th. 

The team finished tenth overall with 
a score of 942. 

Simon had his best finish of 
the season at the Coyote Classic 
Intercollegiate on Feb. 28 to March 1. 
He finished +3 (213) for tenth place 
individually. 

“I was hitting the ball really well 
and I didn’t make that many mis-
takes,” Simon said.

Smith finished with a score of 
227, and Okasaki and Williams tied 
with 232 each. The Tritons came in 
11th overall.

Overall, hopes are high for the 
CCAA Championships.

“Hopefully we’ll carry something 
over from this last round,” Okasaki 
said

Okasaki and the Tritons will 
head to Paso Robles for the CCAA 
Championships April 18 and 19.

Burning Up 
the Track No 
Matter the 
Division

Fogarty on the Move

While UCSD has had some success in 
Division-II athletics, no one really expects 
our athletes to be among the nation’s top 
collegiate athletes. But sprinter Kelly Fogarty 
has put herself solidly in that category with 
her performances this year. The track and 
field star has already broken the school’s 
records in both the 100- and 200-meter dash. 

The 100-meter time is the third best in 
Division II this year, and is only .05 short of 
being one of the top 10 fastest ever in D-II. 
Her 200-meter time is also third best in 
D-II this year. Most impressively, both times 
would be among the 50 fastest recorded this 
year among Division-I athletes. 

Fogarty isn’t alone, however; Nick Howe 
in the javelin throw and Danielle Thu in the 
hammer throw both have marks that would 
be among the top 50 in Division I this year. 

These comparisons aren’t particularly fair 
or useful, as when it comes down to the con-
ference and national meets, UCSD athletes 
won’t have to face anyone from the likes of 
Texas A&M or Florida. Nevertheless, part of  
the beauty of track and field is that it allows 
comparison among athletes anywhere. The 
400-meter oval is the same length on a 
high school track as it is in the Olympics. 
Of course, conditions and competition are 
always important, but it’s interesting to put 
the marks and times of top Triton athletes in 
perspective, instead of just a series of num-
bers on a results sheet. 

Make the Bad Teams Keep Fighting

The NBA and NHL playoffs are just 
starting, and fans can now enjoy what each 
league has to offer. But for some fans, the 
end of the regular season signifies an end to 
their misery. The Minnesota Timberwolves 
went 17-65, losing their last 15 games to 
edge out the Cleveland Cavaliers for worst 
record in the NBA (the LeBron-less Cavs 
won 18 games). The NHL was a little more 
competitive, with its worst team — the 
Edmonton Oilers — going 25-45-12 overall. 

But for these teams and several others 
near the bottom, the season was well over 
by the time they played half their games, 
and there was nothing left to fight for except  
pride. Sure, teams like the Clippers can sali-
vate over their future with Blake Griffin, but 
moral victories and players with potential 
won’t attract the casual fan. 

In nearly every soccer league around the 
world, a system of promotion and relega-
tion is used. In England, for example, there 
are 20 teams in the top league, called the 
English Premier League. But there are over 
140 leagues with more than 7,000 clubs total 
(of which only a small fraction are profes-
sional), and there is the potential for even 
the smallest club to rise to the top over time. 
At the end of every season, the worst three 
teams from each league are relegated into 
the league below, and the top three teams 
from the league below are promoted.  In this 
manner, the teams in each league vary from 
year to year.

One effect of this system is that the 
Premier League is often exciting until the 
last day of the season. The bad teams, such 
as Stoke City or West Ham United — the 
club of “Green Street Hooligans” fame — 
that have no chance of winning the title are 
forced to play their hearts out to ensure their 
survival. The financial consequences of fall-
ing out of the Prem are dire — $50 million or 
more — and can cause the owners to release 
or sell the best players. The race to avoid rel-

Hat Trick Weekend

Five hat tricks — including four by WWPA Player of the 
Week Sarah Lizotte — propel the Tritons as UCSD solidifies 

its postion for the postseason.

With three wins over conference oppo-nents last weekend, the No. 20 UCSD women’s water polo team guaranteed 
itself the second seed in the Western Water Polo 
Association Championships at the end of April. 

The Tritons defeated Santa Clara (9-8), 
Colorado State University (10-6) and Cal State 
San Bernardino (11-6) at The Bronco held at 
Santa Clara University. The Tritons improved 
their record to 9-1 in conference play to take the 
second seed behind No. 8 Loyola Marymount 
University. 

“We went up there knowing that we had 
three big conference games,” head coach Brad 
Kreutzkamp said. “We had one loss [in confer-

ence] going into that weekend, and we knew that 
if we went 1-2 or 0-3, we could slide right out of 
the two spot, and have some trouble at the con-
ference championships. So we tried hard at those 
three games.”

The Tritons traveled to Santa Clara to take 
part in The Bronco, a tournament featuring most-
ly schools from California, and left with a 3-1 
weekend record. The Tritons lost their first match 
to No. 7 San Jose State University, but recovered 
nicely to win the remaining three games. 

In their first match, the Tritons once again 
struggled against a ranked opponent. Despite the

Triton Golf Readies 
for CCAA Tournament
By Jessica Traynor
Staff Writer

Golf — The UCSD golf team seems 
to be peaking at just the right time, 
as the Tritons had their lowest round 
of the season on April 12 during the 
final round of the Hanny Stanislaus 
Invitational. In the last round, 289 was 
good enough to move past four other 
teams to take 12th place out of 20 teams 
competing. Overall, the team ended up 
at +42 with a total score of 907. Captain  
Keith Okasaki did the best individu-
ally, coming in 16th at five over par. He 
was followed by freshman David Smith 
(+9), freshman Jacob Williams (+13) 
and freshman Lewis Simon (+17). 

“To have your freshman [Simon and 
Williams] playing that well is almost 
unheard of in their first year at school,” 
head coach Mike Wydra said. 

Freshmen have been a big part of the 
team this year. 

“We have a lot of freshman on the 
team and we have a lot of potential,” 
Simon said. “We can do really well, we 
just all need to play well at the same 
time.” 

At the Annual SoCal Intercollegiate 
on March 21-22, Okasaki had his per-
sonal best finish. He came in third indi-
vidually, leading the team to a sixth 
place. 

“To fight through all the swollen 
faces, bloodshot eyes, runny noses, and 
sneezing and everything else, still play-
ing well is a testament to their tough-
ness,” Wydra said. “As they got more 
and more comfortable with the course, I 
think they realized they could compete, 
and we’re excited going into the CCAA 
championships.”

Earlier in the season, the Tritons 
placed 10th out of 18 teams at the Grand 
Canyon Thunderbird Invitational on 
March 28 to 29. The team’s total score 
was 914, and Williams was the top indi-
vidual for UCSD, scoring 224 for 24th 
place. 

“Jacob Williams was tied for the lead 
going into the final round and he also 
did not fare well in the final round,” 
Wydra said. “But he got the same kind 
of experience that Lewis did.” 

Williams finished 11 strokes behind Camille Gaito was named CCAA Pitcher of the Week for the second consecutive week and third time this season. Gaito is 21-1 on the season — 
already the third-highest single season win total in Triton history.
