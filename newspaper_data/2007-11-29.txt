A UCSD work group is currently 
analyzing a tentative proposal that 
could eventually result in the forma-
tion of a law program partnership 
with downtown’s California Western 
School of Law.

CWSL Dean Steven R. Smith con-
firmed that the law school is seeking 
ways to expand its academic links to 
UCSD, which he said date back more 
than 25 years. 

“The question is always, ‘What 
should we be looking at next?’” Smith 
said. “This process is exactly that.”

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
University Communications Stacie 
A. Spector said the proposal, sent 
to UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox and Senior Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Drake, is one 
of many that the campus regularly 
receives. 

Drake assembled an informal 
work group composed of adminis-
trators and Academic Senate mem-
bers, who are currently considering 
whether the suggestion merits more 
in-depth consideration, Spector said.

“Chancellor Fox likes to have 
inclusive discussions where her man-
agement team can have a lively dis-
cussion and a variety of perspectives 
are presented,” Spector said in an e-
mail. “There has been no overall deci-
sion or voice of support for or against 
this proposal at this point.”

Smith also declined to com-
ment on the proposal’s specifics, but 
acknowledged that the formation of a 
law program is among the options to 
unite the two institutions.

“It’s the one that comes to my 

mind as a viable option,” he said. 
“The ultimate goals for me, and I 
think for UCSD, [are] finding ways 
to cooperate and improve both pro-
grams.”

Currently, CWSL and UCSD col-
laborate on two degree programs: a 
joint juris doctorate/Ph.D. in politi-
cal science or history and a new 
health law master’s degree, designed 
to assist lawyers and medical profes-
sionals with legal issues relating to 
health care. The two schools entered 
into a formal agreement of associa-
tion in 2002. 

The possibility of a law school at 
UCSD is an exciting prospect for a 
campus that lacks a program targeted 
at legal study, said Pre-Law Society 
co-President Hovik Nalbandyan.

“In my opinion, this would be 
a great thing because Cal Western 
is an ABA-accredited school, and 
this would give more incentive for 
those students interested in law 
school to come to UCSD,” he said. 
“With UCSD’s reputation, I think Cal 
Western would definitely grow in the 
rankings as well.”

However, Smith stressed that no 
formal decision has been made, as 
both groups are still carefully examin-
ing all options to determine how the 
two programs can best complement 
each other.

“What kind of combination is 
what we’re trying to figure out,” he 
said. “I guarantee that my ideas will 
change as we discuss this further.”

Spector said the work group will 
make a recommendation within the 
next few months.

Nearly two months ago, the Earl 
Warren College Student Council 
approved a referendum to increase 
the college’s activity fee by $3. With 
the referendum election taking place 
next week, an advocacy group created 
by WCSC councilmembers is upping 
publicity in an attempt to encourage 
the student body to vote — more spe-
cifically, to vote yes. 

Since the inception of its $4 activity 
fee in 2004, Warren College has main-
tained a constant fee without a built-
in mechanism to automatically adjust 
for inflation. Warren councilmembers 
proposed increasing the fee to $7 to 
both recoup the financial loss of pre-
vious years and move toward self-
sufficiency in the event that the A.S. 
Council eliminates all college council 
funding, WCSC Parliamentarian Dan 
Palay said. 

If approved, the referendum would 
release an additional $26,199 to WCSC, 
which will use the funds for groups 
and events such as the Warren Transfer 
Commuter Commission, Warren Live! 
and the WCSC Events Board. 

Though election bylaws require 
the council to impartially inform the 
student body of the upcoming elec-
tion, individual councilmembers are 
free to act in accordance with their WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN

UCSD Dodges Systemwide Criticism of  Study-Abroad Program

By Justin Gutierrez
Staff Writer

The UC Academic Senate released 
a report earlier this month recom-
mending changes to improve the 
administration and financing of the 
University of California’s Education 
Abroad Program, though the com-
mittee cited UCSD as an excep-
tion to issues plaguing the other UC 
campuses.

Compared to the country’s other 
leading research universities, the UC 
system falls behind the national aver-
age in the number of undergraduates 
who study abroad, the report said. For 
example, the University of Virginia 
— a public institution similar to the 
UC system — sends 37 percent of 
its undergraduates abroad each year. 
About 21 percent of students at the 10 
UC campuses pursue study at foreign 
universities.

In 2005, UC Provost Wyatt R. 
Hume and then-Academic Senate 
Chair Clifford Brunk appointed senate 
members to the Ad Hoc Committee on 
International Education, designed to 
investigate the current status of EAP. 
The committee ultimately decided to 
revamp the program, citing a lengthy 
time interval without review as well 
as the university’s responsibility to be 
internationally conscious.

The original committee com-
posed a mission statement along with 
a list of goals and recommendations 
that were released spring of this year. 
However, the University Committee 
of Planning and Budget subsequent-
ly asked the committee to further 
broaden its approach to address 
“budgetary and integration” issues 
within the Universitywide Office 
of the Education Abroad Program, 
EAP’s center of operations. 

Each campus was given five years 
to double the number of students 
studying abroad, the report said.

“To send approximately 40 to 
50 percent of all undergraduates 
for study is well within the norms 
of higher education nationally and 
constitutes a clear statement regard-
ing the educational priority of global 

knowledge and experience,” the com-
mittee wrote in the report.

The committee said that one of 
its primary concerns is the lack of 
coherency within the network of uni-
versity study-abroad programs. Since 
its inception 40 years ago, EAP has 
witnessed the emergence of numer-
ous third-party organizations that 
provide long- and short-term study 
programs. Many of these programs 
enroll UC students who choose them 
“without expert advice,” the report 
said, which forces students to find 
their way through the process with-
out enough information.

Additionally, the committee found 
that demanding major requirements, 
the cost of a UC education and time 
constraints were cited as reasons 
for decreased interest in year-long 
programs. Committee members pro-
posed that EAP create and identify 
programs to match student demand, 
along with the creation of a more 
centralized systemwide administra-
tion.

Though the coherency of the sys-
temwide program is an issue, UCSD’s 
Programs Abroad Office differs from 
many of the other UC campuses, 
and was cited by the committee as a 

model for other campuses to follow. 
“The difference between our 

method and the methods of other 
campuses is that we centralize our 
operations,” Programs Abroad Office 
Director Kim Burton said.

The campus created the 
Opportunities Abroad Program in 
1985, which serves as a hub for exter-

nal programs in addition to EAP. 
Students can earn academic credit 
for studying abroad outside of EAP 
and receive additional guidance if 
necessary.

“UCSD realized that we could be 
sending more of our students abroad

individual opinions rather than those 
of their council constituencies.

“We can’t as councilmembers say 
‘vote for this,’ but as individuals we’re 
allowed to say whatever we want,” said 
Palay, who both proposed the fee ref-
erendum and organized the advocacy 
group pushing for its passage. “The 
election is sponsored by the council 
and the council’s official position on 
this is to vote, but we are allowed to 
have personal opinions. As a coun-
cilmember I can advocate, no longer 
speaking on behalf of the council, but 
on behalf of the advocacy group.”

Palay’s group is staffed by fellow 
councilmembers and others actively 
involved in Warren affairs. The advo-
cacy group has distributed pro-refer-
endum posters, encouraged resident 
advisers and orientation leaders to 
discuss the advantages of the referen-
dum with students and asked fresh-
men to network within their social 
circles about voting to approve the 
item, Palay said. 

Elections Manager Aaron Horning 
denied that the councilmembers’ role 
in forming the advocacy group consti-
tutes a conflict of interest. Both he and 
Palay said that if an opposition group 
is formed, it will be given the same 
funding as the current pro-referen-
dum group, which is mandated by the 
council’s bylaws.

“I don’t think it’s unfair to not 
have a negative group,” Horning said. 
“I mean, the opportunity is there for 
them to make it. My responsibility 
is to let people know that there is an 
election on the referendum and to give 
them the facts. I can put the opinions 
up alongside the facts. If the advocacy 
group wants to give me the pros and 

the negative group wants to give me 
the cons, that’s great. But I will not 
make them up myself.”

Currently, neither the weekly coun-
cil meeting minutes nor its bylaws are 
available on the WCSC Web site, a 
violation of Chapter 2, Section 2 of 
the bylaws. The Web site coordinator  
is required to post all WCSC meeting 
agendas and minutes on the student-
accessible college Web site, along with 
its constitution and bylaws. 

Among the mediums currently 
available for students to receive elec-
tion information are the pro-referen-
dum posters made by the advocates 
and a Facebook elections group cre-
ated by Horning. The group contains 
the pros, cons, bylaws and other rel-
evant election documents on the Web 
site, and as of press time had 139 
members. Warren enrolls approxi-
mately 4,300 students.

The “pro” argument listed on the 
Facebook group is currently 108 words 
long. The “con” argument is currently 
eight words long. The ballot will print 
both “pro” and “con” statements for 
the fee referendum, both of which are 
currently being written by Palay. 

“I’ll consolidate the pros and 
expand upon the cons for the ballot, 
but it’s really not that important I 
think,” Horning said. “I think that by 
reading the referendum, the student 
body will be able to determine on their 
own how they feel about it.”

Warren students can vote on the 
fee referendum from Dec. 3 through 
Dec. 7 at various locations throughout 
Earl Warren College and on Library 
Walk.

if we could just provide information 
and advising about these non-UC 
options, as well as a formal pro-
cess for students to receive academic 
credit for such experiences, and to 
use financial aid,” Burton said. 

However, even with UCSD’s cen-
tralized administrative model, some 
believe there is room for improve-
ment.

“The Programs Abroad Office 
needs to create stronger connections 
between itself and the other depart-
ments on campus,” said Thurgood 
Marshall College senior Shannon 
Dulaney, who studied abroad in 
Dublin, Ireland. “It was a hassle trying 
to figure out whose approval I needed; 
it was a slight bureaucratic mess.”

Though UCSD provides advising 
to students planning to study abroad, 
some students assumed the responsi-
bilities themselves. 

“I went to a general meeting, 
but it didn’t take me long to choose 
a program,” said Maureen Ravelo, 
an Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
who is currently studying in Paris. 
“The EAP Web site is pretty help-
ful.”

Twenty-seven percent of UCSD 
students who studied abroad last year 
participated in yearlong programs, 
compared to 6 percent nationally, 
Burton said.

In total, the committee made 14 
recommendations to consolidate 
EAP’s administration, make advising 
an integral part of the process and 
ensure enough program financing 
to promote its development as the 
number of students studying abroad 
increases.

Last night’s council meeting began with a healthy dose of social awareness but later gave 
way to an hour-long debate about the 
appropriateness of using A.S. Council 
funds for college-specific matters.

A presentation by members 
from the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee alleged that UC manage-
ment is not negotiating fairly with 
representatives from the American 
Federation of 
State, County, 
and Municipal 
Employees, which 
represents more 
than 20,000 service 
and patient care 
workers through-
out the university 
system.

The speakers stressed the long 
hours and low wages that AFSCME 
service workers endure at UCSD, say-
ing that UC negotiators made student 
observers wait for three hours before 
ultimately refusing to begin talks with 
AFSCME while students were present.

After the presentation, the coun-
cil approved a resolution expressing 
support of the 2007-08 contract cam-
paign.

Next up was a resolution criticizing 
the county’s response to last month’s 
wildfires. It was motivated in part by 
the plight of a family of undocument-
ed immigrants that was detained, and 
later deported, after being accused of 
stealing supplies from the evacuation 
center at Qualcomm Stadium.

The resolution advocated the sus-
pension of immigration enforcement 
during crisis relief and the dissemi-
nation of emergency information in 
multiple languages.

The council approved the reso-
lution and was met with rounds of 
applause from the audience.

Later in the meeting, Earl Warren 

College Senator Peter Benesch took 
the floor to school the council on 
UCSD’s impending parking crunch.

“Over the next five years, there’s 
going to be a steady decrease in the 
number of parking spots [for under-
graduates], but the university is grow-
ing,” he said. “It’s going to get bad.”

In exploring ways to alleviate the 
parking problem, the council consid-
ered increasing bus services, promot-

ing bicycling and 
carpooling and 
restricting fresh-
man parking. 

The night’s 
most contentious 
event, however, 
originated with a 
$63 funding bill 

sponsored by Sixth College Senator 
John Cressey, who requested the funds 
for Sixth College pride buttons.

Though financially insignificant on 
its own, the bill came to symbolize an 
unresolved question from last year’s 
A.S. constitution overhaul.

The bill’s most vocal opponents, 
A.S. President Marco Murillo and 
Vice President of Student Life Donna 
Bean, argued that the limited bud-
get and council’s campuswide scope 
essentially deferred funding of college-
specific matters to individual college 
councils.

However, Thurgood Marshall 
College Senator Kyle Samia supported 
Cressey: “The college experience is 
irrevocably linked to the university 
experience … I’m really disappointed 
in some of the officers for excising the 
colleges.”

The funding measure passed with 
applause, but Samia observed that the 
cause of the dispute remained unre-
solved. 

“Bring your soapboxes next week 
because it’s going to get settled,” Samia 
said.

It’s really not that important I think.” That is Aaron Horning’s stand on equalizing the “pro” and 
“con” statements to be published in 
Earl Warren College’s upcoming refer-
endum ballot. It’s a disturbingly obtuse 
statement, especially from the Warren 
College Student Council’s elections 
manager.

Election bylaws require bipartisan 
presentation on the ballot, and much 
of the current hoopla hangs around 
WCSC’s campaign tactics before the 
vote. There will be much said about 
conflicts of interest, underhanded pro-
motion and devious politicking within 
WCSC, where a sizeable number of 
pro-referendum councilmembers have 
formed an advocacy group to promote 
the $3 fee hike.  

And though this crossed-wire mess 
is a disappointing instance of political 
neutrality, there is no rule being bro-
ken here. Dissenting groups have been 
afforded ample chances to form their 
own campaign.

Councilmembers should be allowed 
the space to hype the agendas they like 
and down the ones they don’t — the 
election bylaws reflect that flexibility. 
However, the bylaws do prohibit coun-
cilmembers from forcefeeding blatant-
ly subjective information to voters.

That was the lesson learned last 
year, when the all-campus elections 

committee slapped a penalty onto sup-
porters of the athletics referendum 
who were flagrantly campaigning too 
close to voting machines. 

This is not the same situation. Before 
the election, WCSC Parliamentarian 
Dan Palay and Horning can plug and 
peddle the referendum all they want, 
through posters, Facebook groups or 
word of mouth — it’s called pre-plan-
ning. 

The advocacy group has done 
exactly that, and even more. Group 
members  have targeted resident advis-
ers and orientation leaders to pass the 
pro-referendum stance onto freshmen; 
it’s a deft move for supporters, who are 
smartly aiming at the demographic 
most closely connected to campus 
politics.

But there’s the rub. Once those pro-
referendum ripples touch the words of 
the voting ballot, there’s a need for con-
cern. The ballot possesses a sacredness; 
it’s an assumed impartiality that voters 
expect, one that is vitally important to 
the elections process and should be 
preserved. That requirement is stated 
simply in the bylaws of this university’s 
election game, so simply that there’s no 
room to conjure a backdoor excuse. 

While Horning has decided to bal-
ance the lengths of the ballot’s “pro” 
and “con” testimonies, his begrudging 
response does a disservice to any fair 

election. If a “con” side is not easily 
composed — which in this instance 
is most likely due to that side’s lack of 
organization — Horning should seek 
it out.

How could the operator of elec-
tions not see the importance of an 
informed vote? How could he not feel 
the responsibility of seeking out dif-
fering opinions to ensure an informed 
vote? 

The very bare minimum should 
be to publicly demonstrate neutrality. 
So save face by stretching the rules, 
councilmembers, but without break-
ing them.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— The routine tug-of-war between 
state educators and legislators over 
funding blues has sprouted yet 
another tiff between California col-
leges. Where there was once a unit-
ed front among college officials for 
statewide education funding, there 
is now competition for a shrinking 
pot.

The conflict came to a head dur-
ing a meeting earlier this month 

when the UC Board of Regents 
voted to oppose Proposition 92 — a 
measure that would reduce student 
fees, initiate a fixed funding amount 
and curb tuition hikes for the state’s 
110 community colleges. 

While Proposition 92 supporters 
took offense to the board’s decision, 
the regents uncharacteristically 
acted with UC students in mind. 

Despite the proposal’s plan to 
lower costs by $5 per unit for com-
munity college students, it would 
have transferred a large portion of 
the fiscal burden to UC and CSU 
students because officials of all three 
systems pull state funding from the 
same pool.  

According to Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s revised 2007-
08 budget proposal, discretionary 
funds — money spent by legislators 
on an as-needed basis — amount to 
only 8 percent of the total state bud-

get. Currently, the 10-campus UC 
system, 23-campus CSU system and 
community colleges procure money 

from this portion of the budget.
Proposition 92, however, would 

further reduce this already dismal 
funding pot by redirecting almost 

$1 billion in the next three years, 
all set aside specifically for com-
munity colleges. Under these finan-
cially restrictive conditions, UC and 
CSU students would again receive a 
raw deal. 

With UC mandatory student fees 
ballooning, community college stu-
dents are not the only ones that 
deserve lower prices. Community 
college costs far less than a UC or 
CSU education — at $20 a unit 
for Miramar Community College 
classes, for example, the maximum 
load of 20 units a semester would 
cost only $400, a far cry from UC 
education fees that soar close to 
$2,000 per quarter. 

If there are any students who 
need assistance paying for college, 
it surely isn’t the ones paying the 
least. 

However, the proposition’s nar-
row aim to bring fiscal relief to only 

a select group of college students is 
not its only flaw; there is another 
equally serious problem with the 
proposed legislation.

Whereas the current system 
requires that the need for additional 
funding be assessed by observing 
attendance at K-12 schools and the 
first two years of community col-
lege, the proposed policy would  
do so by measuring the number 
of California residents between the 
ages of 17 and 25. 

The change would seriously dis-
rupt the system’s efficiency because 
these figures would not accurately 
represent the number of students 
actually attending the various com-
munity colleges. 

This could in turn produce an  
excessive allotment of funds to the 
community colleges that could have 

Along with homemade stuff-ing, pumpkin pie and painfully awkward family 
moments, college football has truly 
become a staple part of the Blunschi 
holidays. Unfortunately, I always 
feel a bit left out, seeing as how my 
dear college is a bit lacking in the 
football team department. With an 
uncle who graduated from Ohio 
State University and two proud 

Trojan siblings, family members  
often belittle my beloved university 
when they rhetorically ask: “Why 
doesn’t UCSD just get a football 
team already?”

I never really gave this idea much 
thought. UCSD has long been con-
sidered a world-renowned research 
institution. We rival some of the 
nation’s finest universities with our 
competitive programs and scientific 
breakthroughs. I guess I’ve always 
assumed that UCSD should simply 
focus on what it does best, instead 
of trying to hype up our lowly 
Division-II athletics program.

I can’t say that I’m a huge sports 
fanatic — in all honesty, I know next 
to nothing about football despite 
my siblings’ constant efforts to edify 
me. However, after attending a few 
USC games over the years, I must 
admit that I do feel envious of USC’s 
football team and all that it brings to 
their college atmosphere. It’s enough 
to make me wonder if UCSD might 
be able to sport a football team of its 
own one day. 

Granted, a football team would 
be expensive. Taking into account 
the cost of constructing a stadium, 
hiring and paying a coach and even-
tually providing scholarships for 
athletes, the Triton football team 
has quite a beefy price tag. 

Additionally, money won’t ensure 
that our football team would be 
any good. Because UCSD has never 
been big on athletics, it’s easy to 
understand why these factors alone 
would keep the campus focused on 

For years, University City resi-dents have been accustomed to the long line of cars clog-
ging Genesee Avenue every weekday 
during rush hour.

But despite the San Diego City 
Council’s promising efforts to bring 
needed relief to the local gridlock 
by constructing an alternative route, 
community members may still  have 
to endure these dismal conditions 
for a few more years.

The city council recently set 
plans to construct a bridge that 
would lengthen Regents Road by 
connecting it to the community’s  
southern region through Rose 
Canyon Park. 

Because environmentalists have 
raised short-sighted concerns over 
the new bridge’s impact on the park, 
traffic alleviation efforts have unfor-
tunately again been postponed, leav-
ing residents to bear the burden of 
roadway delays.

In reality, the bridge would not 
harm the area at all; it would only 
pass through land that has already 
been disturbed by railroad tracks, 

Interstate 5 and another bridge 
above the region on Genesee Avenue. 
Furthermore, it is unrealistic for the 
environmentalists to expect areas 
to go completely untouched in this 
buzzing suburbia, especially in the 
middle of a highly developed city 
with a growing population.

Despite the few environmental 
costs associated with the project, the 
extension of Regents Road would 
bring an essential alternative route 
to Genesee Avenue that would free 
up the city’s roadways for local 
motorists. 

The move is particularly vital to 
ensure that emergency vehicles and 
personnel can best respond to crises 
— currently an almost impossible 
feat when the only roadway con-
necting the northern and southern 
corridors of the city is bumper-to-
bumper for miles during late after-
noon hours. 

These safety concerns have been 
the major justification behind the 
push, and a primary reason for the 
mayor’s support of the council’s 
plans. 

The benefits of mitigating con-
gestion — especially better emer-
gency response time — far outweigh 
the environmental concerns posed 
by the venture. 

With a limited number of road-
way options and a finite amount of 
funds to complete the traffic proj-
ect, environmentalists must rec-
ognize the safety issues associated 

with construction and support the 
measure despite their qualms — or, 
at the very least, move aside so city 
officials can complete the desper-
ately needed development.

Without such a roadway  addi-
tion, Genesee Avenue will continue 
to be the eyesore of University City, 
much to the dismay of local com-
muters.

otherwise been directed to the UC 
and CSU campuses. 

The regents’ resolution also hint-
ed at more dire consequences that 
could result from such unbalanced 
funding. 

“Passage of Proposition 92 could 
result in a reduction in the univer-
sity’s state-funded budget, which in 
turn could result in an erosion of 
university programs and services,” 
the regents said in their decision to 
oppose to measure.

This is not to say that community 
colleges don’t deserve more state 
funding. In fact, they are just as 
deserving as the state’s other uni-
versities, but there is no reason why 
they should be guaranteed finances 
while their sister schools remain at 
the mercy of state legislators. 

The regents — along with CSU 
officials who followed a similar 
course of action last week — were 
therefore right to deny the proposi-
tion’s legitimacy. 

Despite any possible good 
intentions behind the creation of 
Proposition 92, its proposed solu-
tions would prove too weak and too 
narrowly effective to significantly 
improve the quality of  higher edu-
cation in California as a whole.

research and deter anyone from the 
very idea of throwing away money 
on a second-rate football team. 

On the other hand, a football 
team, in time, might be exactly what 
UCSD needs to transform into the 
well-rounded university for which 
students long. It could mean creat-
ing a better sense of community 
and school spirit, a greater degree 
of interest, involvement and contri-
butions from alumni, and the pos-
sibility of building UCSD’s national 
profile. 

Along with stronger name recog-
nition, we could expect an increase 
in the quantity and diversity of 
UCSD applicants as well if we suc-
cessfully accomplish this project. 
These benefits should make our 
institution think twice before it 
scraps the idea entirely.

There’s no doubt that UCSD 
comes up short in terms of social 
activities and school spirit. The 
efforts of Triton Tide don’t go com-
pletely unseen, but unfortunately 
for them, UCSD students put aca-
demics before everything else — 
school is our number-one priority 
(and it sometimes spills over to our 
number-two and number-three slots 
as well). 

Students aren’t out at basketball 
tournaments or water polo games 
rooting for the home team; in fact, 
they’re all right here in Geisel with 
me as I’m writing this article (it 
took me a good 10 minutes to find 
an empty outlet for my laptop). 
Though the fact that most of us 

study in the library during our free 
time probably thrills our parents, it’s 
probably not what’s best for students 
in the long run. 

Students need a balanced col-
lege experience. Studying and doing 
well in school is important, but it 
shouldn’t overpower our physical 
and social well-being. 

Even Harvard and Princeton 
seem to find the time to enjoy col-
lege football, 
and they’re 
some of the 
most competi-
tive and pres-
tigious schools 
in the country. 
USC is another 
example of a 
fine academ-
ic institution 
where sports 
enhance the col-
lege experience 
without affect-
ing the educa-
tional aspects of student life. Why 
can’t UCSD do the same?

Our hypothetical football team 
doesn’t have to be in the Rose Bowl 
during its inaugural years in order 
to have an effect on school spirit and 
a sense of community — its mere 
existence could have a tremendous 
effect on the student body. 

Plenty of other schools have ter-
rible football teams, but still enjoy 
college team rivalries and the expe-
rience of staying up late to come up 
with witty signs or plans of deco-
rating their bodies in their school 

colors. Yeah, it’s a bit ridiculous, 
but it’s something that alumni will 
remember and look back on fondly 
for years to come. I can’t necessar-
ily say the same is true for my late 
-night study sessions on the sixth 
floor of the library. 

Aside from forcing UCSD stu-
dents to interact with each other 
and get a wholesome college experi-
ence, creating a football team could 

pay for itself if 
we execute it in 
the right way. If 
we can garner 
enough support 
and funding 
(through student 
fees, fundraising 
programs and 
donations) to 
develop a foot-
ball team and 
UCSD responds 
positively, ticket 
sales and alumni 
donations could 

compensate for the costs of running 
a team. Historically, UCSD’s alumni 
giving rate has consistently fallen far 
below that of UC Berkeley, UCLA, 
UC Irvine, UC Davis and many 
other neighboring California insti-
tutions that rank far below UCSD 
academically. Is it a coincidence that 
most of these schools have better 
athletics programs than UCSD? 

Alumni love sporting events 
— especially football. It gives them 
a reason to come back to their alma 
mater and interact with the fresh 
faces of the university. 

The idea of creating a UCSD 
football team could definitely help 
reduce the current alumni apathy 
and help our university to engage 
alumni in our campus community. 
Their potentially generous dona-
tions wouldn’t hurt UCSD either 
— but those donations won’t be 
coming in any time soon if we con-
tinue the status quo. 

Another important advantage of 
a football team is the name rec-
ognition and strength of UCSD’s 
national profile. 

College football games are one of 
the primary ways that people hear 
more about universities across the 
country. Chances are, a great deal of 
the East Coast’s high school students 
have never heard of UCSD. And if they 
have, it’s likely that they have us con-
fused for one of our other neighboring 
San Diego colleges, both of which do 
have football teams. 

By giving us greater recognition, 
a football team could certainly woo 
many out-of-state applicants just by let-
ting them know that our school exists. 
This could result in a more diverse and 
competitive applicant pool, strength-
ening our admissions and boosting 
our reputation as a university. 

While I doubt the Triton football 
team will appear on campus any 
time soon, I remain hopeful that 
the campus maintains some hope of 
launching a team sometime in the 
not-too-distant future. 

Perhaps then UCSD can become 
an even greater university, and 
maybe my football-fanatical family 
will stop harassing me, too. 

“Our hypothetical football team doesn’t have to be in the Rose Bowl ... its mere 
existence  could have a 

tremendous effect.”

BEST BETS    druthers 
Daft Punk’s “Electroma”

KEN CINEMA / NOV. 30 & DEC. 1 / MIDNIGHT / $8.75

The distant future. Two robots on an 
odyssey to become human. This Friday 
and Saturday at San Diego’s Ken Cinema, 
the midnight hour calls in Daft Punk’s 
(Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel 
de Homem-Christo) directorial debut, 
poised to become a late-night staple 
after well-received screenings in Paris 
ran for six months. To prepare for the 

project, Bangalter did his homework 
by purchasing a couple hundred back-
issues of American Cinematographer; and 
although none of their own music appears 
in the film, the Frenchmen have curated a 
minimal score featuring Brian Eno, Curtis 
Mayfield and other Daft Punk inspirations 
to accompany the stark narrative. Rock 
on, robots. (Chris Kokiousis)

During the day, the four Brooklyn-
based Ivy Leaguers that call themselves 
Vampire Weekend are just another buzz 
band with some self-titled EP on iTunes. 
But by night, these amateur Bruce Waynes 
roam the city streets, infecting venues with 
their groove-able, minimalist pop songs 
(imagine a collaboration between Spoon 
and Ray Davies) that turn the dance floor 
into a springy carousel down by the Village 
Green.

Even though Vampire Weekend won’t 
release their debut album until January, 
Euro and East Coast audiences have been 

cyber-zombified — already able to sing 
along to everything the band throws their 
way. Frontman Ezra Koenig reminisces 
about the not-so-distant highs and lows 
of college life, his stories wordy but simple 
enough to prevent afterthoughts, like a far 
less pissed-off Jarvis Cocker, if the Brit had 
been born in the Upper East side.

After scoring top marks as openers for 
the Shins, Vampire Weekend are ready to 
strike out on their own this Sunday at the 
Casbah to convert San Diego audiences 
alongside fellow nightcrawlers Grand Ole 
Party. (Jeff Wang)

t’s tricky business, recapturing an aura. 
Not to mention the defiant, notoriously 
slippery aura of a pedestalled man like 
Bob Dylan, who — no matter how people 
may fight to shape him into their own little 

voice-of-America figurine — only forks his persona 
a thousand more directions, always contradictory, 
never content. And even then, Dylan must fight the 
resulting expectation for constant change, because 
a true cowboy doesn’t stick around once the locals 
have got him pinned.

In order to avoid simplistic or misinterpret-
ed caricatures — such as, most recently, Hayden 
Christensen’s obvious unkempt brood in “Factory 
Girl” — the real-life Dylan makes an effort to 
squelch biopic hopefuls from the getgo. But appar-
ently the old grump saw something he liked in 
twisted “Far From Heaven” director Todd Haynes, 
whose multiple-personality tweak on the portrait-
of-a-legend trend promised to pay adequately artsy 
tribute to the folk icon’s many rebirths and dodgy 
transformations. “Maybe the film also had a little bit 
of irreverence in it as well and it wasn’t just worship-
ful,” Haynes said in a phone interview. “I think that 
actually is something he finds refreshing.”

But all this talk of Dylan’s epic elusiveness, of 
Haynes’ daring use of six separate actors to repre-
sent the aura’s many layers, like it’s all some kind 
of left-field taboo — like it’s something strange for 
a person to be without singular shtick — seems a 
little dramatic. Yeah, so one of the Dylans is a box-
car-hopping black kid (Marcus Carl Franklin) who 
claims to be Woody Guthrie, and one is the feminine 
Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), who sidesteps from “A 
Hard Day’s Night” frolic to surreal “8 1/2” garden 
party without so much as a between-scene fade. But 
despite Haynes’ best efforts to fragment the artist’s life 

beyond literality, a few dreamlike sequences (includ-
ing Quinn machine-gunning the Newport Folk 
Festival crowd, aka going electric) are not enough to 
warrant such controversy. After all, Blanchett is an 
impeccably male replication of the 1960s icon, her 
scenes linear and mostly true to life; let’s just say the 
obligatory celeb-impersonation Oscar (“Ray,” “Walk 
the Line”) isn’t far in her future.

Then again, the film’s plotless composition is 
admittedly strange compared to its biopic contem-
poraries. Its strains never merge, its narratives miss 
many a beat and no one can be trusted — even 
talking heads are fictional (Julianne Moore does an 
excellent recounting as the Joan Baez-based Alice 
Fabian). Not a single character upholds the unadul-
terated authenticity we skeptical digital-agers have 
become so obsessed with. Aside from Franklin and 
Blanchett, the film’s other Dylans include Christian 
Bale as both wide-eyed folkster and born-again pas-
tor, Heath Ledger as the movie star commissioned 
to play the voice of a generation, Ben Whishaw as a 
rebellious poet/interviewee and Richard Gere in an 
almost off-puttingly metaphoric take on “Billy the 
Kid.” His characters are as much parts of Dylan as 
parts of Haynes and parts of ourselves — nothing is 
about just one person, and no one person is entirely 
authentic in the traditional sense of the word.

Haynes’ intentions aren’t a behind-the-music 
tour through Dylan’s ups and downs, most of which 
we’re tired with already; in fact, lifeline summary is 
all but lost to the wind. If the filmmaker only cap-
tures one thing, one previously intangible essence, 
that is enough. “I think the best way to enjoy it is 
— like it’s taking a drug or having a dream or get-
ting inside a great Dylan record,” Haynes said. One 
entirely human feeling that transcends past and 
present, worth a million summaries.

BY SIMONE WILSON • HIATUS EDITOR

I didn’t think I’d ever find myself defending Soulja Boy’s good name, but this is just ridiculous, people. “Supermanning a ho” is 
exactly what Soulja Boy shows us in the video 
— a dance move. Nothing more. You might 
know this if you spent less time watching “Two 
Girls, One Cup” and spent more of your free 
time on YouTube, watching high-schoolers 
invent variational dances in their bedrooms. 
Just type “Crank Dat” into the search window, 
and you’ll get about 31,000 results — and most 
aren’t by Soulja Boy. Ever heard “Crank Dat 
Spiderman”? How about “Crank Dat Batman”? 
These aren’t double entendres; they’re actu-
ally dances inspired by the Marvel and DC 
universes.

Those who think Soulja Boy has such a dirty 
mind should check out his biography: Born in 
1990. That’s right, the kid turned 17 this year. 
Dude just wants to dance — and, apparently, so 
does the rest of the country. Some of the most 
successful Southern rap singles in recent years 
have been little more than vehicles for popu-
lar dance moves: “Lean Wit it, Rock Wit it,” 
“Shoulder Lean,” “Walk it Out” and “Snap Yo 
Fingers” certainly come to mind. Even New 
York rappers — who years ago wouldn’t be 
caught dead imitating their Southern competi-
tion — are taking part, with limb-looseners like 
“Chicken Noodle Soup” and “Aunt Jackie.”

The “Crank Dat” Movement — yeah, I called 
it a movement — is different from its slow-
spreading predecessors because it almost wholly 
originated on the Internet. As a result, the 
process is more democratized, and the memes 
are multiplying rapidly. For instance, not long 
after the “Simpsons Movie” came out, there 
was a “Crank Dat Spider Pig” rap and dance 
on YouTube — a reference not only to the 
movie, but also to YouTube rappers’ procliv-
ity toward superhero subject matter. Stupid as 
the song is, you have to off your hat to Young 
Steph for his willingness to rap about cartoon 
characters (“Hoes — I get ’em, clothes — I get 
’em/ snitchin-ass niggas, yeah I call ’em Chief 
Wiggums”), complete with a hook from Homer 
himself.

“The Simpsons” isn’t the only unlikely inspi-
ration for “Crank Dat” spinoffs. Old arcade 
games are also fair, uh, game  — “Crank Dat 
Ryu” is a personal favorite. For some reason, 
nerdy black characters from ’90s sitcoms are 
also popular (everyone knows “Crank Dat 
Carlton” is 10 times cooler than “Crank Dat 
Urkel Dance”). I’d actually love to see a “Crank 
Dat Elaine Benes” as well, but I’m not holding 
my breath.

Of course, as with any Internet phenom-
enon, there have been a number of “Crank 
Dat” parody songs. Some, like “Crank Dat 
Army Boy,” take direct shots at the sheer stu-
pidity and unoriginality of Soulja Boy’s song 
and dance. Others really blur the line between 
parody and just another “Crank Dat” remake. 
For example, “Crank Dat Folgers Boy” features 
all coffee-related rhymes and dance moves: 
Imagine someone doing the Soulja Boy with 
a coffee mug in hand, pulling moves to lines 
like “Catch me at that local Starbucks, yes I’m 
gonna bring the team/ Haters getting mad 
cause I got me some extra cream.” It even 
opens with the Folgers coffee jingle. Don’t 
believe me? YouTube that shit.

The beauty of the movement is that literally 
anything goes, so long as it follows the “Crank 
Dat” form. Sure, “Folgers Boy” is a parody, but 
the song and dance actually exist, and thou-
sands of people have actually watched it on 
YouTube. So those who argue that the Internet 
ruined rap need to relax (even though they’re 
probably right), because it has clearly saved 
rap by reviving it as a great medium for dance, 
even if the music itself isn’t always that great. 
At least it’s not boring.

8  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2007

Clockcleaner
■ Babylon Rules
LOAD

W hen you overhear stories about the most-hated band in Philadelphia, you can’t help but be curious; piss and blood 
and drunken brawls earned Clockcleaner 
their infamy, and Babylon Rules follows the 
same depraved path.

The smarmy trio resembles a clunkier, less 
playful version of classic Iggy and the Stooges. 
John Sharkey III doesn’t have Iggy’s pipes, but 
growls with ill conviction and throws in the 
occasional bloody yell to enforce the group’s 
explosive breakdowns. At times, a pleasant 
singing voice peeks its head out of the trash, 
then realizes people are watching and dives 
back under. The lead guitar squeals as if 
Sharkey intentionally kicks his amp with the 
brunt of his foot at every chord change like a 
neglected dog.

Most tracks trudge along with the inten-
tion of capturing sludge-metal vibes minus 
the virtuosity, settling on a sort of brooding 
sludge-punk. Tones are relegated to dissonant 
guitar/bass scuzz for the low end, creepy 
noodled arpeggios for the upper registers and 
beat-to-hell minimal drums for the skeleton.

“Daddy Issues” bumps like the Sonics but 
meaner, needing only a few blasted power 
chords and a shuffling two-note riff to get its 
three-minute sexual release. “Hit hit, boom,” 
Sharkey barks with a Danzig-esque drawl.

But “Vomiting Mirrors” is Clockcleaner’s 
revolting centerpiece, made catchy by the 
periodic bursts that all the instruments 
endure together, as well as the light piano 
base. It’s an experience akin to rolling around 
in a landfill with eager supermodels; the wild 
charge of overdriven chords and drummed 
insistence, plus the echoplex yelps, poses a 
moral dilemma. Fortunately, the gag reflex is 
overwhelmed by greater urges.

KING’S SCI-FI COMPLEX LOST IN 
SHODDY GREEN-SCREEN ‘MIST’

By Autumn Schuster
Senior Staff Writer

A slap on the wrist and “Bad Stephen King!” might be in order for his newest novella gone cinematic. Like a straight-to-DVD 
movie that drunkenly stumbled into theaters on 
its way to Blockbuster, “The Mist” is creamed in 
cheap thrills and CGI effects that would make 
even a five-year-old giggle. True, King was the 
man who brought us classic horror reads like 
“The Shining” and “Pet Sematary” where he 
scared the living shit out of us, but his touch 
doesn’t always mean instant gold: He’s also 
blundered through sloppy monster flicks like 
“The Langoliers” and now, “Mist.”

For a lack of anything scarier this fall, “Mist” 
just might squeak out some play on slasher 
pranks alone, disguised in blatantly terrible spe-
cial effects and including neo-horror staples like 
locking random people inside a building while 
a mysterious bad guy peruses the perimeter. We 
might as well be in our ass-grooves at home, 
watching some Sci-Fi Channel original movie 
like “Anacondas 4.”

So where did all the budget’s green go? 
To one of those pricey actors pulling a J.Lo, 
demanding only holy-mountain water blessed 
and hand-delivered to the trailer by the Dali 
Lama himself? Not even the mild fame of 
Oscar-winner Marcia Gay Harden can explain 
why director Frank Darabont scraped by on 
the cheap, making his giant tentacles look like 
imports from “World of Warcraft.” One might 
even speculate that the oh-so-scary, penetrat-
ing mist is merely a ploy to hide shoddy CGI 
spiders and scorpion-mosquito thingies.

Whatever the case, the bonanza of freaky 
critters is present only as a backdrop for the 
film’s more character-driven drama. Like so 
many seemingly simplistic horror films, the 
central catastrophe is actually an opportunity 
to delve into the twisted human psyche. King 
attacks the age-old question of who is more 
monstrous — man or monster? — by shov-
ing about 20 townies and outsiders into one 

small supermarket during an unnatural disaster. 
Their best and worst sides are exposed when the 
store captives realize they’re in serious trouble 
and must rally together to survive.

For one of the film’s better performances, 
Harden plays religious zealot Mrs. Carmody, the 
prophet of the bunch, who incessantly preaches 
that the end of days is nigh and shows her blood-
stained finger to the camera, declaring it a down 
payment for God. Though the film’s conquering 
hero bores as a white, middle-class, attractive 
He-man who has all the answers, many minor 
characters carry their fair share of gumption. 
One big-time lawyer (Andre Braugher) is won-
derfully awkward toward said hero (Thomas 
Jane), bringing cringe-worthy intensity to every 
line, regardless of how small or seemingly unim-
portant; and the best part of his restrained creep-
iness is that it’s completely at odds with every-
one around him. In a very Vincent D’Onofrio 
vein, Braugher oozes weird and acts with such 
groundless hostility that we almost wonder if he 
resents just being in the movie.

The tired us-vs.-them theme is somewhat 
salvaged by King’s ability to create characters 
we truly loathe and drop them into the most 
ridiculous situations: When someone is slain 
for his stupidity, the entire audience claps, and 
whenever someone leaves the store it’s terrifying 
regardless of how stupid the reason. The film 
rarely ruts in scenes where people aren’t ripped 
to bits, crying about something or blowing each 
other away, a throwback to those days when all 
men were tough guys and monster suits had vis-
ible zippers. Slip “Mist” into your ’80s B-movie 
marathon, and its psycho-analyzing story might 
start to shine through the fog-machine haze.

I celand. Images of vikings, frost-bitten tundras and Bjork come to mind. No one is more befitting to provide the soundtrack to this strange land mass, 
full of even stranger people, than Iceland’s most 
beloved sons, Sigur Rós: Their lush cello-bow-on-
guitar swells and frontman Jon Birgisson’s haunt-
ingly feminine falsetto embody the mystery of their 
homeland, where the majority of inhabitants believe 
in elves and the majority of the landscape is volcanic 
wasteland.

The quartet’s new double-disc features previously 
unreleased gems and live sets, complemented by the 
DVD “Heima”, which contains both a documentary 
and live footage of the band’s Icelandic tour in sum-
mer 2006. The two albums are treated separately, 
each with its own fuzzy cover art (disc two pictured 
above), but work together in creating a unified 
feeling of homecoming, digging into the band’s 
pre-breakout catalogue — before any studio heads 
forced them to record a track for recording’s sake 
— for an organic, untreated intimacy, as if one would 
normally hear these ethereal verses resonating from 
the cliffs of Reykjavik. 

Hvarf (“disappearance”) boasts five studio rari-
ties pulled from the furthest back-pages, includ-
ing a 1995 demo of “Von.” Heim (“home”) is the 
unplugged half of the whole, with six acoustic 
tracks that still manage to give off the bravado and 
grandiosity of their studio counterparts — if any-
thing, even more so. Birgisson sits on the floor, bow 
drawn, causing the instrument to sing in a falsetto 
not unlike his own (even more bonechilling when 
stripped of atmospherics). As if by accident, his 
microphone picks up the birds singing outside and 
the soft pitter-patter of rain.

Sigur Rós’ latest island-spanning lullabies dip as 
low as the fjords and as long as a Nordic winter, but 
even when out on the northernmost tip of nowhere, 
we still feel strangely warm and peaceful inside 
because we know we’re home again.

MFAs Strip ‘Medea’ to Its Murderous Core
By Sonia Minden
Senior Staff Writer

Aman leaves his wife for a younger woman — a plotline as recogniz-able to modern audiences as it 
was to Euripides’ playgoers in 431 
BC. But what makes “Medea” a tragic 
paradigm of wild proportions is not 
its conveyance of the archetypal heart-
broken woman, but of a woman so 
racked by grief she is driven to reck-
less measures, murdering her husband 
and, ultimately, her children.

Any actress would devour Medea’s 
role, thick with motives both rash and 
psychologically profound. Though she 
possesses supernatural prowess, it is 
incited by a weakness so intimately 
human that — even amid homicidal 
enchantments — we identify with her 
agonizing outcries.

Second-year MFA student Jihae 
Park tackles these sweeping transitions 
with an elegance and intelligence that 
lights up the hauntingly bare set. As 
she shudders, eye-level with the audi-
ence and doused in a syrupy blood-
red spotlight, we are invited into the 
conscience of an embittered woman, 
tossed aside after a lifetime of grovel-
ing at men’s feet. By the time the 85-
minute production reaches its chilling 
climax, we don’t know whether to 
commend her triumphant testament 
to woman’s cunning, or question her 
willingness to betray motherhood for 
the sake of vengeance.

A perfectly synced chorus — ser-
vants clad in tattered beige trench 
coats and white face paint — acceler-
ates Medea’s emotional rollercoaster 
and provides needed punctuations 

of comic relief (think men mim-
ing childbirth), when Park’s raging 
monologues begin to fatigue. The 
chorus members only break from 
their fluid narration to play Medea’s 
counterparts — Mandel Weiss reg-
ular Johnny Wu impressively rises 
from choral chanting as Jason, the 
coolly patronizing husband who 
assures Medea that his desertion is 
entirely rational. “I’d rather be sung 
about than be a saint,” he smugly 
explains. This self-satisfied swagger 
exposes the root of Medea’s repressed 
hatred without being overtly antago-
nistic — the gender powerplay is 
subtle yet present throughout Park’s 
interactions with the expertly unlik-
able King Creon (Peter Wylie) and 
Aegeus (Irungu Mutu).

But nonstop heady plot revela-
tions don’t encumber the production, 
thanks to the artful insight of direc-
tor Isis Saratial Misdary. The circular 
stage is framed by little more than 
tightly hung ropes and a single black 
staircase, from which Medea descends 

(the initial point of her avalanche into 
madness). A piece of red silk acts 
at once as her poisoned offering to 
Creon (father of Jason’s new bride), 
and as a call to the deities to justify 
lethal intentions. 

The limited use of props comple-
ments an equally sparse musical back-
drop. The hollow beating of a single 
drum parallels appropriate peaks in 
Medea’s quest for retribution. 

The timelessness of the Greek epic 
is drawn upon in Misdary’s adaptation 
— we could be witnessing any era, 
any kingdom, any woman’s anguish. 
While this interpretive style allows 
certain liberties (amid spiritual trans-
formation, Medea’s speech dissolves 
into rapid Korean diatribe), it also 
neglects scenes that are traditionally 
expected (Medea’s final chariot ride, 
King Creon’s decision to poison him-
self). Omissions aside, we still leave 
the theater with the disturbing under-
standing that a woman’s grief can bend 
the limits of human reasoning to their 
gruesome breaking point.

“We don’t have any nationally 
acclaimed recruits coming in so no 
one knows anything about us,” he 
said. “We don’t get respect in the 
league but we know we can play, and 
our team isn’t shy to share that.”

The Tritons 
got a taste of 
c o m p e t i t i v e 
conference play 
a few weeks ago 
at a preseason 
tournament held 
in Long Beach. 
According to 
Spangler, the 
tournament was 
an opportunity 
for teams to mix and match play-
ers and find chemistry with different 
formulas. Matches lasted an hour and 
a half and teams were encouraged 
to fit in as much volleyball as they 
could during the allotted time. Long 
Beach State, Cal Baptist and Hope 
International all gave the freshmen 
a feel for the speed of collegiate vol-
leyball.

After the tournament, Leserman 
was pleased with the talent of the 
new players but is encouraging 
everyone to raise it to the next level.

“Right now our biggest weakness 

is our youth and inexperience,” he 
said. “The college game is a lot faster 
than high school and I’m trying to 
teach [the new players] that.”

Ring echoed Leserman’s senti-
ment, saying that the new recruiting 
class will bring height to the Tritons’ 

front line, allowing 
UCSD to match 
up better size-wise 
with other confer-
ence teams.

The team 
is focusing on 
improving its 
passing and serv-
ing. Ring wants 
his players to be 
more aggressive 

but still play smart. Because UCSD 
doesn’t pay money for top recruits 
like its competitors, the Tritons feel 
that improvement in these areas 
can lead to a vast development on 
last season and give them a better 
chance at running their offense.

All the preseason’s hard work will 
be showcased when the regular sea-
son begins Jan. 4 against UC Santa 
Cruz, which the Tritons have not 
faced since 2002.

HOT CORNER

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s basketball team 
returned home this week after anoth-
er tough non-conference season 
opener. Despite holding an early lead 
and attempting to make a late come-
back, UCSD fell 72-62 to regional 
opponent and former California 
Collegiate Athletic Association foe 
Grand Canyon University on Nov. 
24. The Tritons now stand at 0-2 on 
the season as they prepare for their 
home and conference opener this 
weekend.

UCSD scored first against the 
Antelopes as it did the previous week-
end at 
San Diego 
S t a t e , 
extending 
the 7-2 
lead with 
two early 
three-pointers by sophomore guard 
Jordan Lawley. Grand Canyon 
responded with a 7-1 run, but the 
Tritons bench would help tie the game 
again with a jumper by sophomore 
forward Andrew Browning and back-
to-back layups from junior center A.J. 
Maulhardt. UCSD would re-take the 
lead 16-14 on a Lawley jumper before 

the Antelopes tied it again. Following a 
timeout, junior guard Shane Poppen’s 
jumper gave the Tritons another two-
point lead with 10:58 left in the first half. 
The Antelopes’ Milee Karee responded 
with a four-point play, drawing a foul 
on a successful three-pointer and con-
verting the free-throw attempt, and 
then knocked down another three to 
give Grand Canyon a 23-18 advantage. 
The Antelopes would extend their lead 
to 12 points and head into intermis-
sion up 37-25, as UCSD managed only 
seven points — with five from junior 
forward Henry Patterson — during the 
first half ’s final 10 minutes.

Junior guard Andrew Hatch said 
the Tritons’ inability to penetrate the 
key contributed to the team’s first-half 
struggles.

“Grand Canyon stayed in a zone 
the entire game and we had trouble 
getting good looks inside 20 feet,” he 
said. “We missed a lot of open shots, 
but for our team to be successful we 
have to work inside out.”

Patterson again put UCSD on the 
board first during the second half 
with two free throws. The Antelopes, 
though unable to put UCSD away, 
were able to retain their double-digit 
lead for most of the second half. The 
Tritons faced their biggest deficit in 
the game with 6:22 left to play as an 
11-2 Grand Canyon run put the score 
at 63-46. However, the Tritons, led by 
Hatch, fought their way back within 
striking distance.

Hatch, who missed all of last sea-
son due to an injury, hit two three-
pointers as part of an 11-0 UCSD 
run that pulled the Tritons within six 

points with 1:13 left to play. Despite 
another Hatch three-pointer with 31 
seconds left, Grand Canyon converted 
nine of 11 free-throw attempts down 
the stretch to hold on for the win.

Hatch said his flurry of field goals 
beyond the arc came from good oppor-
tunities created by other Tritons.

“Getting our team back in the 
game … came from my teammates 
— driving and hitting the gaps, then 
kicking the ball out and giving me 
the opportunity to knock down open 
three-point shots,” he said.

Hatch added that he hopes to be 
a veteran leader and perform well in 
the clutch.

“I just want to contribute as much 
as I can this year,” he said. “I want to 
look back on my years here as a time 
when UCSD men’s basketball became 
a force in the CCAA.” 

Hatch led UCSD in scoring with 
12 points on four of five three-point 
attempts, while also dishing out four 
assists in 15 minutes off the bench. 
Lawley and senior guard Clint 
Allard also scored double-digits for 
the Tritons with 11 and 10 points, 
respectively. Allard posted eight assists 
and five rebounds, both tying game-
highs. The assist total fell just short of 
his career-best nine assists recorded 
against Grand Canyon in January 
2006.

As a team, UCSD shot 41.5 percent 
from the field, including 54.2 percent 
in the second half when they held 
Grand Canyon to below 40 percent 
field-goal shooting. The Antelopes SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN FILE

Sophomore forward Andrew Browning netted four points in 12 minutes coming off the bench against the 
Antelopes. UCSD’s dormant offense needs a jolt for its home opener against Cal State Stanislaus on Nov. 30.

Young Tritons Ready for D-I Titans

By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
has plenty to prove after last year’s 
5-23 showing, but there is prom-
ise for the Tritons as they return 
five starters to a potentially explo-
sive squad that last year toppled 

Division-I opponents University of 
Southern California, Princeton and 
Long Beach State University.

Last year’s youth is now one year 
older, one year wiser and has one 
more year of experience; head coach 
Kevin Ring, now in his third year at 
UCSD, expects experience to play 
a large role in the team’s improve-
ment.

“We have four freshman start-
ers returning with experience in 
competitive matches,” he said. “The 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
is an extremely competitive confer-
ence. I’m not making predictions 
about ‘x’ number of wins. We’re just 

trying to put a competitive team on 
the court and we can do that.”

UCSD is led by lone captain 
junior libero Eric Leserman and 
a supporting cast of sophomores: 
outside hitter Will Ehrman, oppo-
site Frank Fritsch and outside hit-
ter Jason Spangler return for their 
second season in a Triton uniform. 
The trio power the Triton offense, 
but will be without Ehrman’s service 
for the first half of the season due to 
shoulder surgery.

Spangler admitted that Ehrman’s 
absence is a big loss, but there is a 
new crop of players waiting to fill 
his spot.

“Losing Will is a big hit because 
he’s one of out best defenders,” 
Spangler said. “It would be nice to 
have a guy with a year of experience 
but we’ll see how things go. We’ve 
got four or five guys fighting for 
his position and the competition in 
practice is only making us better.”

Ring must also find a replace-
ment for the departed setter Brooks 
Dierdorff, who was the only senior 
to graduate last season.

“[Dierdorff] was a steady three-
year starter and is not an easy replace-
ment,” Ring said. “We are mixing 
things up every day at practice and 
keeping a lot of stats. [Freshman] 
Phil Bannan and our backup from 
last year [sophomore] Billy Arnold 
are working extremely hard, and its 
still wide open.”

Once the setter position is cement-
ed, UCSD will field one of its young-
est lineups in recent memory. With 
no seniors on the roster, the Tritons 
are one of MPSF’s up-and-coming 
teams. UCSD is the lone Division-II 
team in a conference of Division-I 
opponents, which includes the past 
three national champions.

Ehrman said the bigger schools 
don’t pay much credence to the 
team’s new talent, which only makes 
each win that much sweeter.SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN FILE

The last time the women’s basketball team faced Chico State on Mar. 12, the Tritons pounced 
on the Wildcats for a decisive 80-63 victory in the NCAA Division II West Regional Finals.

Coming off its best season, if 
not the best season of any UCSD 
team at the Division-II level, the 
women’s basketball team will look 
to stay undefeated and start a 
new California Collegiate Athletic 
Association win streak when the 
No. 4 Tritons (5-0) host Cal State 
Stanislaus and No. 8 Chico State on 
Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, respectively.

Last year’s Tritons had a fierce 
rivalry with the consistently com-
petitive Chico State squad, split-
ting the season series at one apiece 
before blowing out the Wildcats 
in the final game of the NCAA 
West Regional at RIMAC Arena to 
advance to the Elite Eight for the 
first time in program history.

Both games will tip-off at 5:30 
p.m. at RIMAC Arena.

with tests against rivals 
No. 8 Chico State and 
Cal State Stanislaus.

First-year head coach Chris 
Carlson has not had the same strong 
start that his counterpart on the 
women’s team has enjoyed. However, 
the Tritons have only dropped two 
contests, both on the road and one to 
Division-I San Diego State, and have 
a chance to erase their early woes 
with a strong start to conference play 
in front of a home crowd.

UCSD is set to host Cal State 
Stanislaus and Chico State over the 
weekend, and even splitting the 
games will give the Tritons a lift 
as they enter a five-game home-
stand before hitting the road for 
four straight California Collegiate 
Athletic Association contests from 
Jan. 4 through Jan. 12. 

Both the Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 games 
are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. tip-offs.

UCSD can bounce back 
from a rough start to 
non-conference play 
with wins over the 
Warriors and Wildcats.
