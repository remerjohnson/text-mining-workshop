Worldwide 
Brother of Nepal's 
Slain King Named as 
Regent 

KATMANDU, Nepal - The 
bizarre massacre of most of Nepal's 
roya l family was followed Saturday 
by the bizarre ascension to the 
throne of Crown Prince Dipendra , 
the love-struck young man who, by 
most accounts, murdered his par-
~I1lS and at least seven other rela-
tives. 

Di~ndra's fi tness to be king of 
this Himalayan nation is not only 
called il1lo question by the murder-
ous acts attributed to him but byevi-
dence that he attempted suicide.

Police Arrest Activists UC 
Transfer 
Admits on 
the Rise 

SEJ still tryi ng to 
get ,I ivi,ng wage 
for Jan Itors 
By PATRICK LEE 
Staff Writer 

Police arrested several pro-
testers Friday during a rally held 
by Students for Economic 
justice. 

Organizers of the rally said it 
was in response to UC officials' 
failure to meet the demands of 
Local 2028. a represel1lative of 
the Service Employees 
Il1lernationa l Union. The union 
has fil ed five different charges 
with th e ational Labor 
Relations Board alleging unlaw-
ful conduct by Berge nson's 
Property Services, the company 
contracted to provide janitorial 
services to UCSD. 

University officials said that 
they are not to blame in the dis-
pute because the janitors are 
hired through the contractor. 

SEj organized the rally on 
behalf of the janitors. Members 
asked university officials to inter-
vene and set a policy would not 
only guarantee janitors living 
wages and benefit standards, but 
tha t would also father a "respon-
sible contractor policy" that 
would ensure that only corpora-
tion s respectful of workers' 
rights would be eligible to con-
duct business with the ·university. 

SEJ's demands were made 
over a month ago. Twenty SEj 
members entered a Chancellor's 
Associates meeting on May 22, 
citing the administration's fail-
ure to respond as the reason for 
their appearance.

Student Foundation Donates Picnic Tables 
Foundation, student organizations and Preuss students he lp assemble gift 
By DANA WEST 
Staff Writer 

Members of the UCSD Student 
Foundation, A.S. Council represen-
tatives, Preuss School students and 
affiliates of other student organiza-
tions gathered at the Preuss School 
on Friday afternoon for a dedication 
ceremony in which picnic tables 
were donated to the charter school. 

Preuss School Director Doris 
Alvarez began with a few words on 
Change for Change, the fi ve-col-
lege competition to raise money 
for the tables. 

Alvarez stressed that students 
should act on thei r ideas beca use 
only then will those ideas have 
meaning. 

Change for Change raised 
$7,700 to provide tables to the 
Preuss School. 

Marshall college won the com-
petition. 

Alvarez then introduced Ping 
Yeh, president of the UCSD 
Student Foundation, who 
explained to the students in atten-
dance who he represented and, in 
simple terms, what the mission of 
the foundation is. 

"We are here to make UCSD 
better and our community 
stronger," Yeh said. 

Arthur Brody, a UCSD trustee, 
spoke about the Change for 
Change event and the table dona-
tion from the point of view of a 
donor. 

Veronica Radnoty, the presi-
dent of the Associated Student 
Body at the Preuss School, spoke

Admissions: 
Asian-American admits 
are up 22 percent 
Continued from page 1 
were admitted from community 
colleges. This group of students 
compri ses blacks, American 
Indians and Chicano and Latino 
students. 

At UCSD, 62 blacks, 33 
American Indians and 502 
Chic<v1o and Latino students 
were admi tted. These groups rep-
resen t 1 S percent , of all UCSD 
transfers. That is 2S percent more 
than last year, and 7S percent 
more than 1997, when 340 were 
admitted. 

Out of all the UC schools, only 
Los Angeles, Irvine and Santa 
Barbara admitted more underrep-
resent~d minorities. 

Asian-American transfers were 
up 22 percent at UCSD. which 
admitted 1.1 S1. The number of 
white transfer students to UCSD 
increased 12 percent from last 
y~ar; 1.143 were admitted. 

"Increasing student access to 
UC through the transfer route is 
one of the university'S highest 
priorities." said UC President 
Richard Atk inson. "These admis-
sions resu lts demonstrate that, 
working closely with the commu-
nity colleges. we are making good 
progress. " 

Much of the goa l of intensify-
ing minority representation on 
campus was outlined in 1997 in a 
··memorandum of understanding" 
belwcen thc UC system and 
California community colleges. 

Minority admissions have 
increased every year since 1997. 
The UC Office of the President 
attributes the increase to a 
strengthened relationship 
between the University of 
California's nine campuses and 
the 108 ca mpuses of the 
California Community College 
system. 

Guaran teed transfer admission 
agreements for those who meet 
GPA and coursework require -
ments. in addi tion to increased 
outreach programs. helped 
increase the number of students 
who are able to successfully 
transfer. 

"Overall. the outreach strategy 
has been to crea te vertical inte-
gration between K through 12. 
community colleges and the 
University of California: said 
Interim Vice President of 
Educational Outreach Manuel 
Gomez. . 

Gomez also noted that pro-
grams such as the Summer 
Readiness Program. which accl i-
mates transfer students to full -
time college life. take this integra-
tion a step further to assist trans-
fer students. 

Vice Chancellor of Californ ia 
Community Colleges Christopher 
Cabaldon said community col-
leges have worked hard to create 
an environment that steers their 
students on a UC track. 

Community colleges have 
"positively changed students ' 
expectations of the health and 
viability of the transfer process." 
Cabaldon said. 

According to Cabaldon, there 
are still three challenges that 
plague the transfer process. He 
said colleges need to make stu-
dents more aware of the possibil-
ity of transferring to a UC school. 

Cabadon also said that th e 
transfer process should not be 
made confusing or tedious. and 
students need to be assured that if 
they fo llow the procedures of 
transferring. they will succeed in 
working toward a degree. 

Assist , a Web site that helps 
community college students plan 

transf~rs with ease. is helping 
many students. according to the 
Office of the President. The Web 
site can be accessed at

Davis Announces Grant for 
New UC Merced Campus 

Gov. Gray Davis announced May 30 that a 
grant of $2 million from the William and Flora 
Hew lett Foundation for Habitat Preservation for 
the site of UC Merced. 

The grant will provide funds to allow UC 
Merced to acquire and manage 5,750 acres of 
vernal pool habitat destined to be preserved as 
a part of the campus. 

UC Merced currently employs almost 65 edu-
cators and professionals. The main campus in 
Merced is scheduled to open in fall 2004 and 
will enroll 1,000 students. In the coming 
decades, the campus is expected to serve 
25,000 students. 

UC Merced contributes to the educational 
access of the San Joaquin reg ion with spec ial 
education and outreach centers. 

A new UC Merced center will open ill 
Modesto this year. 

'Listening to San Diego' 
Conference to Be Presented 

The San Diego Regional Studies Network will 
present "Listening to San Diego' on June 9. The 

program is the second In a series designed to 
bring together scholars and citizens for discus-
sion and to raise consciousness about a variety 
of San Diego lssues. 

The conference, which will be held June 9 at 
the Price Center Theater from 8:30 a.m. to 1 
p.m., will include a panel discussion and break· 
out workshop sessions led by San Diego 
researchers and community leaders. 

Topics will include neighborhood·oriented 
policing , animating democracy, the Intergroup 
Relations Project, civiC journalism, the Oral 
History project, religious groups and civic 
engagement in San Diego. 

The San Diego Historical Society and UCSD's 
Civic Collaborative joined forces earlier this year 
to establish the SDRSN. 

On Feb. 20, the group presented a 120-page 
directory of San Diego County Historical refer· 
ences. 

UCSD Researchers Trace 
Residues of Explosives 

Chemists at UCSO have developed a silicon 
polymer 'nanowire,' 2,000 times smaller than 
the diameter of a human hair, which can 
detect trace amounts of TNT and picric acid, 
both of which are commonly used in terrorist 
bombs. 

The discovery was detailed in the June 1 
issue of the German ohemistry journal 
Angewadte Chemie. 

With professor Wlillian C. Trogler's assis-
tance, Honglae Sohn, a postdoctoral student in 
Trogler 's laboratory, produced the silicon poly-

~er and discovered that it can detect explo-
sives. 

The silicon polymer is a sensitive tool that 
can be used to combat terrorist attacks and 
locate unexploded bombs and mines. 

The polymer is a long string of silicon atoms 
surrounded by organic molecules, ·and it con-
ducts electricity and glows under ultraviolet 
light due to a property known as biolumines-
cence. 

The polymers might be used to detect TNT 
leaking from old, unexploded bombs in sea 
water, such as those now littering the reefs on 
Kahoolawe in the Hawaiian Islands.

Some Thoughts on 
Attaining My Degree 

Jaded & 
Faded 

CAROLINE SONG 

T his article marks the end of my short-lived career as an opinion columnist. 
I can almost hear a few cheers 
(certainly I will read them in the 
comment section of the Guardian 
Web site), but I hope that there 
will be one or two readers who 
will be sad to see me go. 

I suppose that I am expected to 
reflect upon my five years at U{::SD 
and to find something positive to 
take with me as I move forward in 
my life. In doing so, I shall make 
you, gentle reader, reflect upon 
your own years at UCSD, be they 
one or five or seven. 
- Well, actually, I won't. Then; 

will be no pats on the back dis-
tributed in this column. We'll all 
get at least five hours of those at 
the various commencement cere-
monies we will endure on Sun-
day, June 17. There's a reason 
why this column is called "Jaded 
and Faded: and here 'it is: I'm not 
so proud of myself. 

Sure, I studied somewhat hard 
to earn this degree. But I'm a lit-

erature major - for God's sake, 
how hard can it be? I've never 
slaved away in a bioengineering 
lab for eight hours at a time. I 

-worked my way through college, 
but they were mindless jobs: 
cashier, photocopying, data entry, 
writing for the Guardian. I've yet 
to earn more than $10 an hour. 

Meanwhile, my younger, engi-
neering major brother makes $20 
an hour atJet Propulsion Labora-
tories doing something my feeble 
mind couldn't possibly compre-
hend. But all is not lost. I did 
manage to get my sorry ass into 
law school, so my parents haven't 
completely lost face. 

But those are not the reasons 
why I'm not so proud of myself. 
When I entered UCSD in the fall 
of 1996, I knew that in four or five 
years I would walk out with a 
degree. There was never a doubt 
in my mind. But along with that 
degree, I had hoped for the attain-
ment of the equivalent number of 
years' worth of personal develop-
ment. 

After all, the educational degree 
is only half of the reason we come 
to college. The other halfis to grow 
up. And grow up I did, but was it to 
the extent that I had hoped for? 

I am inclined to think that the

Senior Staff Writer 

Since elementary school, we 
students have had evolution 
ingrained into our minds. 

As we studied in our science 
classes through high school and 
college, our teachers and profes-
sors taught us that facts proved 
that human beings and everything 
around them had evolved from 
nothing. The idea of an infinite 
creator creating everything was 
completely laughable. Scientific 
evidence proved that God could 
not have possibly created the uni-
verse in six literal days, as the bib-
lical book of Genesis states he did. 
Only those who have not looked 
at the data or are purposely obliv-
ious to it could possibly cling to 
the ancient belief of creation. 

Our society and some scien-
tists may seek to portray creation 
as an age-old idea to be discarded 
by our modern world. The evi-
dence, however unwilling evolu-
tionists are to admit it, paints 
quite another picture. It casts a 
large shadow of doubt over an 
atheistic view of the origins of the 
universe. A simple glance at our 
everyday life will show that the 
world we live in is a world of 
immense complexity and intelli-
gent design ; mere randomness 
and chance cannot explain this. 

If we step outside and look to 
the skies, we cannot help but be 

struck by the intricacy that is pre-
sent. In 1686, a prominent scien-
tist wrote, "This most beautiful 
system of the sun, plano::ts and 
comets could only procct:d from 
the counsel and dominion of an 
intelligent and powerful being. 
This being governs all things, not 
as the soul of the world, but as 
lord over all, and on account of 
his dominion, he is wont to be 
ca lled Lord God, Universal 
Ruler." 

That scientist was none other 
than Sir Isaac Newton, the fa ther 
of modern physics and possibly the 
greatest scientist who ever lived. 
Newton attributed the creation of 
the natural world to God because 
of its intricacy, and the same intri-
cacy that ewton saw in his day is 
quite evident to us today. 

Thinking of the sun, we can 
imagine the complexity that New-
ton was writing about. Scientific 
research shows that the sun is 
quite out of the ordinary. To begin 
with, it is the only star in this solar 
system. Though this is taken for 
granted when we wake up every 
morning and see it rise, most 
other stars belong to multiple star 
systems. If that were true of our 
own galaxy, the Milky Way, Earth 
and the other planets would suffer 
from extreme temperature fluctu-
ations. 

Not only is the sun special in 
its quality but also in its size, 
which helps it to sustain life on 

earth. If our sun were as big as .1 
red giant, then it would be so large 
that it would o::ngulf all of the 
in ner planets through gravita tion-
.tl pull . If our sun were as big .IS .I 
blue-whIte giant, it would be 
25,000 times as bright as it cur-
n:ntly IS and would thus l'mlt te),) 
much hIgh- frequency radi,uioll . 

On the other hand , if the Still 
wae smaller, the energy it would 
emit would be insufficient to sus-
t'lin any type of life - unless, of 
course, the planets were much 
closer to the sun, which would 
dangerously affect Earth 's ocean's 
tides. 

There is more intricate design 
evidenced by the position of the 
sun. The orbit of our sun within 
the galaxy is fairly circular. 
Because of its orbit. the sun does-
n't get 100 close 10 the inner 
galaxy, where supernovae 
(extremely t:nergetic star explo-
sions) are more common. Our 
sun is also at an ideal distance 
from the galactic center, called the 
co-rotational radius. Only here 
does a star's orbital speed match 
that of the spiral arms. 

A final look at the sun will 
show that it is immensely stable. It 
is tnle that the sun does infre-
quently eject huge flares. When 
these flares occur, they wreak 
havoc on modern life, disturbing 
power grids and satelli tes. One

Women's Rights Not Won Yet 
American women are ignorant of practices elsewhere 
By MARY-GNEUA EITUDILLO 
Staff Writer 

While I sit in my swivel chair in 
a posh downtown La Jolla salon, I 
flip through some fashion maga-
zines, trying to pass the time until 
my foil highlights are done. For 
most of the time that I invest in 
typical women's magazines, I'll 
usually read things such as 
"Who's Hot in Hollywood: sift 
through "One Hundred Fashions 
for Under $100," read about 
"What Drives Men Wild in Bed" 
and figure out "How to Lose 10 
Pounds in Just 10 Days." 
. But this time, as I go through 
the pages, an article catches my 
eye. It 's about women's rights. No, 
not about abortion issues, sexual 
harassment cases or any other 
issue we have come to associate 
with women's liberation, but 
about basic human rights that 
have been denied to women all 
around the world. 

While women in America have 
won voting and reproductive 
rights, the average American 
woma!l forgets that , while she 
may be currently fighting for 
equal pay for equal work, her 

international counterparts are still 
suffering physical abuse under 
archaic laws and traditions that 
give omnipotence to male author-
ity. 

Today, women all around the 
world still generally earn less than 
men, cannot own property (in 
some cases, they are even consid-
ered property), do not have access 
to education, health care or legal 
help, and are still being brutally 
raped, enslaved and even mur-
dered without so much as a blink 
from their governments, Women 
make up two-thirds of the world's 
1 mill ion illiterate people. Statisti-
cally, there are more women living 
in poverty than men. In some 
countries, women have to struggle 
to support and care for their fam-
ilies in the midst of civil wars and 
armed conflicts. 

In China, newborn girls are 
carelessly discarded on the street 
like cigarette butts thrown eut of a 
car only to lie dead, naked and 
covered with dirt and trash on the 
side of the curb (see this month's 
issue of "Marie Claire" magazine 
and yo u'll know that I'm not 
embellishing). In parts of Africa , 
female geni tal mutilations are 

widely practiced and accepted 
procedures. In parts of Asia and 
even in territories under the gov-
ernance of the United States, 
women are being held in sweat-
shops, where they make a mere 
two cents per hour, packed 20 to a 
room. 

In countries where strict inter-
pretations of Islam are observed, 
such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and 
Afghanistan, premarital and extra-
marital sex (only on the woman's 
part) are legally punishable by' 
flogging or stoning, usually until 
death. Not to mention the other 
abuses that are socially mandated 
by customs: A woman who rejects 
a man 's advice is likely to get acid 
thrown in her face to disfigure her 
for life, while a woman who is 
raped and becomes pregnant is 
likely to be sentenced to 100 lash-
es. According to an article in 
"Glamour" magazine, 6,600 
women are murdered each year in 
incidents such as these in India 
alone. 

American women sit in relative 
comfort compared to their inter-
national counterparts. Although

such flare disabled a power grid in 
northern Canada in 1989. 

However, the stability of our sun 
is shown when we compare it to 
Olher Stars similar in luminosity, 
size and composition. Comparable 
stars are known to erupt in super 
flares every 100 years, on average. 
Super flares, true to their descrip-
tion, are much more potent than 
regular ones, 100 to 100 million 
times stronger than the 1989 flare 
that disabled the power grid. If such 
a super flare were to be directed 
toward Earth, the ozone layer 
would be completely destroyed. 

A careful look at the size, posi-
tion and stability of the sun will 
show that it's all part of a complex 
design that chance cannot account 
for. The design can only be attrib-
uted to "the counsel and dominion 
of an intelligent and powerful 
Being:' in Newton's words. The 
self-evident design undeniably 
gives credence to the ancient view 
that God said, "Let there be light ," 
and there was light. In addition, the 
uniqueness of our sun shows that 
the "Heavens are telling of the 
glory of God, and their expanse is 

OPINION 7 

declaring the works of his hands" 
(Psalm 19:1). 

Evidence of design and a 
designer does nOl merely stop at 
the heavens. Our own human bod-
ies are probably the greatest evi-
dence of a creator. The human 
body is, by all accounts, a master-
piece. The degree to which our 
bodies are efficient and precise is 
frankly mind-boggling. Looking at 
any aspect of our bodies reveals 
convincing evidence of a creator. 

An investigation of the human 
eye will cause the observer to nott' 
how intricate and complex it is. 
There are three imperceptible 
movements that the eye makes. 

The first is a tremor, which is 
the tiniest of the movements. The 
tremor continuously and rapidly 
revolves the human eye around its 
center. The diameter of that move-
ment is approximately one one-
thousandth of a millimeter. In a 
matter of about six hours, the eye 
muscles that cause the tremors 
revolve the eye more than a million 
revolutions. If the eye were not abk 
to make these revolutions, the 
light-sensing cells in the eye would 
quickly stabi lize and cease to give 
information to the brain . This 
would cause the images perceived 
by the eye become blurry and gray 
in a matter of seconds. A very intel-

Come on, it's been five years - so 
what if my best friend in high

girls are like her, yet I still have 
trouble trusting other women. 

How about passing judgment 
on others before really getting to 
know them? This is a lesson I've 
learned more than once, but still I 
find myself thinking that I've got a 
person all figured out without ever 
even talking to her. College is sup-
posed to broaden the mind, but 
sometimes I find myself feeling a 
bit shrunken and shriveled. 

And the one that gets to me the

The wonder of the human eye 
does not stop with tremors. The 
next two eye movements are close-
ly related. The muscles of the eye 
not only allow for it to tremor but 
also to drift and saccade. During a 
drift, the eye drifts relatively slowly 
and smoothly off the target until it 
reaches an angle equal to about 12 
times the size of a tremor. 

At this time, the eye automati-
cally jerks. via a "saccade." back to 
its original position. Saccades,

movements that are used to cor-

pled friends. I have several friends 
who have been with the same girl 
or guy for three, four, six, even 
seven years! They're single, but not 
really. Not that I lament my time 
and opportunity to play the field a 
little bi t more than they have, but I 
have yet to pass the one-year mark. 
At almost 23, that's a little too 
much time and opportunity to play 
the field, in my opinion.

I think most of us here take for 
granted that we will earn our bache-
lor's degrees. All of our lives, we have 
been bred to choose a goal and work 
for it, and it naturally follows that we 
will achieve it if we work hard 
enough. But the same cannot be said 
for personal development. 

lines of text, the alignment of a 
person's two eyes is synchronized 
by a saccade. 

The investigation of the 
human eye shows that it would 
be nearly impossible for only a 
relatively intelligent being, such 
as a person, to create such a 
mechanism. When noting the 
complexity of the eye alone, it is 
quite easy to understand why the 
Psalmist wrote, "I will give thanks 
to you, for I am fearfully and 
wonderfully made; wonderful are 
your works, and my soul knows it 
very well" (Psalm 139:14). 

The nature of this complexity 
reveals that there must be some 
intelligent design behind both the 
sun and . the eye. Both a design 
and designer are clearly evident. 
The evolutionist, on the other 
hand, has a gaping hole in his 
theory, which is left by the design 
of the human eye and the sun. 
Evolutionists refrain from men-
tioning the innumerable other 
aspects of our natural world that 
vividly show design and a creator.

I've always had some foggy 
idea of the person who I want to 
be, but choosing a path to reach 
that goal has not been so easy. 
There are no counselors, no cata-
logs of courses. We have friends 
and family who will flunk us if we 
do something wrong, but not 
always in a manner constructive 
enough to help us learn the cor-
rect lesson. Not to say that this is 
their fault - they are all muddling 
through their own personal devel-
opment educations. 

[n the end, we are our own 
issuers of the personal develop-
ment degree. I do not feel that in 
the last five years I've earned my 
bachelor's degree. Perhaps that's a 
good sign. Perhaps if [ did feel that 
I had earned it, it would indicate 
my ignorance of just how much [

By GALVA BunON 
Contributing News Writer 

When you meet with Melvin 
H. Green, treat him to a cup of 
coffee. 

It is a small token of gratitude 
for the conversation that will fol-
low. He will take a seat, talk and 
listen. It is something he has done 
with students for 38 years. 

Green has promoted faculty 
and student interaction since he 
came to UCSD in 1963. He is 

r~tiring at the end of spring quar-
ter. 

"I came to UCSD because of 
my intuitive feeling that UCSD 
would turn into a great school," 
Green said. 

Growing up in a first-genera-
tion, low-income household, edu-
cation was strongly stressed in 
Green's family. 

Green graduated from the 
University of Pittsburgh in 1958 
and received a doctorate degree in 
biochemistry from the University 
of Illinois-Urbana in 1962. 

Following post-doctorate work 
at Cal-Tech with Renato 
Dulbecco, the 1975 Nobel Prize 
Laureate in medicine, Green came 
to UCSD when the school was 
preparing to accommodate its first 
undergraduate class for the fol-
lowing year. 

At 26, he was the fifth member 
of the biology department. 
Because he was young, he easily 
related to students, interacting 
with them outside the classroom. 

Green directed the Academic 
Enrichment Program from 1994 
to 1999, aiming to provide under-
graduate students with an acade-
mic experience that extended to 
research, tutorial support, train-
ing and mentoring. 

"I feel I have a great sympathy

been put together earlier as an 
example to the students. 

Yeh then read one of the 
plaques that will be put on the 
tables: "From current college 
scholars to future college schol-
ars," 

Jeremy Howard, ASS advisor at 
the Preuss School, spoke about 
student leadership and how the 
Change for Change program was a 
very good example of the leader-
ship exhibited. 

He then presented the UCSD 
Student Foundation with a plaque 
showing the school's apprecia-
tion. 

The ceremony was followed by. 
a reception with cake and fruit 
punch . UCSD and Preuss School 
students then combined efforts to 
assemble the 11 tables. 

"The kids were pretty excited 
about these tables," Yeh said. 
"They'd never built anything 
before, but they were very 
focused and they worked well in 
a .group." 

for and understanding of stu-
dents, especially those with nei-
ther parent having gone to col-
lege." Green said. "As director of 
this program, I had the opportu-
nity to help students even more 
than by teaching class. I am very 
excited about having this oppor-
tunity." 

Green also started the Health 
Professions Program, as well as 
the Faculty, Student and Staff 
Interaction Program, which was 
popular for the easygoing setting 
that allowed students, faculty 
and staff to get to know one 
another. 

The latter program was on hia-
tus for a short time, but has 
returned, thanks to encourage-
ment from Green and the dedica-
tion of some of his students. 

"Teaching is not lecturing; 
Green said. "Lecturing is merely 
one small component of teaching. 
Teaching is helping a' student 
attain his or her objectives in life." 

When first entering a universi-
ty, the opportunities offered can 
be simultaneously interesting and 
intimidating. When students 
barely know what major to 
declare, direction is greatly need-
ed. 

Green has worked to help 
students overcome these hurdles 
they face in pursuing their goals. 
Green understands that a stu-
dent's inability to succeed is not 
because of lack of intelligence, 
but "the inability for some rea-
son to cope with psycho-social 
demands ... a breakup with a 
boyfriend, a problem with par-
ents." 

Green continues to promote 
interaction between faculty and 
students to help provide students 
with guidance and direction . His 
latest idea involves bringing 

the transfer program, especially 
with the program's success in 
getting underrepresented 
minorities on UC campuses. 
They would like to see a 6 per-
cent increase every year, as out-
lined in their "partnership agree-
ment" with Gov. Gray Davis. 

together emeriti faculty with 
freshman and sophomore under-
graduates in mentorship relation-
ships. 

This prograf!1 is intended as a 
reward for outstanding students 
and to help attract tOP students to 
UCSD. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Planning and Programs 
David Miller looks forward to 
starting this program in the 
upcoming year. 

"[t's a clever idea to use a 
resource [emeriti facultyl we don't 
take advantage of." Miller said. "A 
lot of students could benefit from 
faculty members. The more pro-
grams you have, the more benefi-
cial it is." 

Green still approaches his lec-
tures with a mix of seriousness 
and laughter. His juxtaposition of 
"Monty Python" and biology 
might not be understandable at 
first, but there is no question 
about the sincerity of Green's 
connection with students. 

Although he is retiring, Green 
plans to teach a few classes at 
UCSD next year. He will continue 
to be the president of SioTek Ed, 
a company he created to teach 
biotechnology to nonscientists. In 
addi tion, he will work for Avanir 
Pharmaceuticals and become 
CEO of the Peaceful Transitions 
Foundation. . 

But first he is spending three 
weeks in Europe to celebrate his 
"retirement." Upon returning, he 
will continue to interact with 
UCSD students and friends, be it 
in a game of tennis or over a cup 
of coffee. 

By having coffee with Green or 
another faculty member, Green 
hopes students just might get a 
better sense of what college is 
truly about.

"If the regents approve dual 

admissions this summer, along

Community Colleges Thomas j. 
Nussbaum agreed. 

believe one student was elbowed in 
the face." 

The SEIU and SEJ, whose orig-
inal "justice demands" included 
policy adjustments and the rehir-
ing of Alejandra Rodriguez with 
full back pay, have demanded that 
the university make a formal apol-
ogy for the alleged assault on stu -
dents at the Chancellor's 
Associates meeting. Rodriguez was 
fired for trying to organize 
nonunion janitors, according to 
the SE[U. 

University officials said they are 
investigating the complaints with 
help from the Immigration and 

aturalization Service and the uni-
versity'S own audit department. 

Vice Chancellor Rogers Davis 
said that if the investigation finds 
proof that Bergenson 's has violated 
state or federal labor laws, its con-
tract will be terminated, reported 
local news station NBC Channel 
7/39. 

Hundreds of students, faculty 
and janitor supporters attended 
the rally on Friday. Alejandra 
Rodriguez made opening remarks 
at the rally. 

"I t is a pleasure to be here wi th 
all these students today - the 
unity is empowering; Rodriguez 
said. "It is also empowering to be 
working together with the students 
and the union to which I now 
belong to try and rid of injustice 
this prestigious university." 

Other SEJ members, including 

SEJ said that the university had 
decidcd to meet with students on 
Wednesday, but that this action 
was not ~nough. SEJ gave the 
administration until 10 a.m. Friday 
to meet its demands. 

At 12:45 p.m., protesters carry-
ing signs, yelling chants and bang-
ing drums marched over to the 
Chancellor's Complex, where other 
SEJ members spoke briefly. 

The group marched to the 
intersection of Villa La Jolla Drive 
and La Jolla Village Drive. PoliCt, 
supervised the event. 

Many of the television net-
works in San Diego covered the 
march . 

Upon arriving a t the intersec-
tion, the hundreds of protesters 
circled the intersection. linked 
arms and blocked traffic in all four 
directions. 

The chanting demonstrators 
were dispersed by police officers -
all except a few. who remained in 
the middle of the intersection. As 
an officer read the protesters their 
rights, they continued to chant and 
refused to move. 

Fifteen protesters were evc11tu-
ally arrested. 

Galligani stressed that admis-
sions I11.lmbers will improve if the 
UC Board of Regents approves 
Atkinson's dual admission pro-
posal. which would place stu-
dents on a guaranteed track from 
high school to UC school admis-
sion if they meet certain require-

"A large increase in the num-
ber of admits is essential if we 're 
to achieve our ultimate goal of 
increasing the number of trans-
fers who actually enroll."

LENDING 
A HELPING 

Members of Alpha Epsilon Delta work with doctors 
to provide free medical services south of the border 

It is easy to ~ rget that there is 
a Third World country a few miles 
south of us, where living condi-
tions are much different and 
health care is not an option for 
most people. Just south of 
Enscnada, however, lies a small 
medical clinic that UCSD students 
organize and run free of charge. In 
March, I went down with a UCSD 
group called Alpha Epsilon Delta 
IO document the work that they do 
south of the border. 

AED is a national honors pre-
medica l society that UCS D 
became a part of two years ago, 
and consists of roughly 300 pre-
med students. Though they do 
many things to educate them-

selves about the medical field 
(incl uding orga nizing the fi rst 
UCSD prc-mcd group forum), the 
main endeavor of AED at UCSD 
is the medical cl inic. 

AED shares the clinic wi th 
another pre-med group on cam-
pu that is called the Flying Sams. 
both of which try to go down one 
Saturday per month. They bring 
dOClOrs with speciali7.3tions that 
includc pediatrics, womcn 's care 
and general practice. Thc patients 
they get depend on the specializa-
tion of the doctor. 

The students walk the patients 
through step-by-step. They wel-
come the patients in and provide 
the preliminary care, which 

involves asking the patients what 
their problems are, taking vital 
signs su£h as blood pressure and 
pulse, and staying with patients 
until the doclOr is done with them. 
The students do as much as they 
possibly can but never anything 
thev arc nO! trained for. Thev treat 
patleills until there are no n;ore IO 
treat, which is usualll' around 10 
to 15 patients per day, though 
there has been an increase since 
the beginning of the year as more 
people learn about the program. 

Volullleering at the medical 
cl inic is educational fo r the stu -
dents because they get hands-on e

Copy Editor 

I know what you 'r~ all wonder-
1I1g: "How can Th~ UCSD Guardian 
possibly hope to maintain - let 
alone improve - its astronomical-
ly high s tandard of excellence with 
so many editors and staff members 
graduating?" Well, not to worry. 1 
promise there will still be good 
rt~ason to grab a Guardian when 
September rolls around. 

I t IS true, we are losing some 
ntremely talented and hard-
work1l1g people - people who are 
Irreplaceable, really. 

Our beloved editor in chief, 
Vincent Gragnani, will be graduat-
ing, leaving behind the newspaper 
that has practically defined his co l-
kge career. After two years of 
being a staff writer for news, and 
onc yea r of being news editOr, 
Vince was the ollly choice to hold 
the reigns of the Guardian this yea r. 
And held them he has. The 
Guardian will never be the same 
withou t him. 

But don't worry. A couple of 
weeks ago, Alison I orris and I 
were elected co-editors 111 chief (by 
freakish coincidence, we tied), and 
Vince has been training us for the 
job ever since. We cannot replace 
Vince, bu t we can bring our own 
ideas and styles to the Guardian, 
hopefully building on the quality 
a nd standard Vince has brought 
tillS yea r. 

True, we are also losing our 
managing editor, Bill Burger. After 
a year of writing, Bill became 

The UCSD Guardian 

Incoming Editor in Chief 
Promises Continued 
Excellence for the Paper 

sPOrtS editOr last year, and as 
managing editor, he kept in touch 
with his roots by covering men 's 
and women's tennis. Bill made a 
perfect managing editor: He is 
approachable, decisive and fair, 
and he can even hold his own 
with a red pen. 

Luckily, next year's managing 
editor slot will be filled by current 
news editor, Lauren Coartney. 
Lauren has done a great job with 
news this year, and we are confi-
dent she will be able to continue 
in Bill's footsteps as both an editor 
and a manager. So we've got that 
base covered . 

Tom Vu, our opinion editor, 
will also be leaving us. Like clock-
work, Tom managed to come 
through with a section chock-full 
of all the skewed and out-there 
opinions us Guardian weirdoes 
cou ld possibly come up with . His 
section was rarely late, and was 
a lways solid and balanced. It will 
be quite difficult to repeat his per-
formance. 

Facing this challenge next year 
are Divya Runchal and Jenn ife r 
Sposito. Divya became co-opinion 
editor earlier this year, so she has 
had plenty of experience. Much 
like many of our opinion 
columns, Divya is a lso skewed and 
out-there, so our opinion section 
should continue to be quite inter-
estin&. Jenny, who is co-copy edi-
tor, IS an extremely eloquent 
writer and should add exceptional 
clarity and intelligence to the sec-
tion. Perhaps even Ben Boychuck 
will agree that our opinion section 

will indeed be fine. 
Sports Editor Robert Fulton 

and Associate Sports Editor Scott 
Burroughs are also graduating, 
relinquishing their solemn 
responsibility of bringing the 
UCSD comm unity all of the 
UCSD sports news fit to print . 
Robert is Mr. Dependable here at 
the Guardian. His section is a lmost 
never late, and in its pages are all 
anyone would want to know 
abou t sports at UCSD. If one of 
his writers was out of town or 
sick, Robert would just write the 
article himsel f. Scon is the best 
sports columnis t we've got. 
Though sometimes his columns 
are only slight ly related to sports, 
they are always en tertaining, and 
from knowing the guy, they very 
well could all be true. And yes, 
Neil Dennis does in fact exist. 

Despite losing such talented 
and diligent sports editors to grad-
uation , sports is perhaps the sec-
tion we have to worry about least. 
It will be headed up by current 
Associate Sports Editor Isaac 
Pearlman and current Features 
Editor Josh Crouse. We would be 
lucky to have just one of these 
guys running sports. Isaac has 
worked under Robert for most of 
the year, so on top of being a 
superb writer, he knows how to 
consistently put out a quality sec-
tion . Josh has written sports for a 
daily and has been an editor for 
almost two years now, so he has 
more than enough experience to

HOROSCOPES 

By LASHA SENIUK 
Tribune Media Services 

Ari •• (March 21-April 19) 
This week, Aries, a close friend 

or colleague may provide an 
unusual glimpse into his emotion-
al motives: Before mid-week, 
expect others to discuss previously 
withheld feelings, past social 
events or sentimental loyalties 
between friends . All is positive, 
Aries: Watch for gentle surprises, 
subtle declarations of love and 
shared appreciation from co-work-
ers. Listen carefully for promising 
ven tures. 

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 
Before Wednesday, Taurus, 

physical energy may be low: 
Watch for minor muscle aches, 
low back pains or temporary skin 
ailments. Expect vitality and opti-
mism to return before mid-week. 
Some Taureans, especially those 
born in late April, may a lso expe-
rience increased dream activity, 
fresh social insight and quick 
romantic realizations. Expect deep 
feelings to emerge, Taurus. It's 
time to test key relationships and 
create long-term romantic com-
mitments. 

Gemini (May 21-June 21) 
Romantic frustration and social 

moodiness will soon fade, Gem: 
Over the next two days, many 
Geminis will receive a powerful 
glimpse into their own emotional 
needs. After Thursday, yesterday'S 
family relations and romantic dis-
putes will no longer affect key rela -
tionships. It 's time to lei go of the 
past and move on. 

Cancer (June 22-July 22) 
Over the next few days, Cancer, 

watch for a new level of romantic 
passion in key relationships. Many 
Cancerians have recently experi-
enced a brief period of romantic 
distance or complex social pressure. 
Before mid-week, however, expect a 
dramatic shift: Both romantic part-
ners' and close relatives may now 
compete for y<?ur attention, 
demand equal time or propose 
unusual home activities. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Business success and romantic 

fulfillment now become a top prior-
ity, Leo. Over the past few weeks, 
many Leos may have fdt restricted 
in working environments or misun-
derstood by loved ones. All of this 
quickly fades early this week, Leo, 
and will soon be replaced by dedi-
cation and renewed passion. Gather 
information and social energy over 
the next few days, Leo, and then 
prepare for new business projects 
or ask loved ones for added time, 
attention or commitment. A strong 
week, Leo: Stay alert. 

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
Recent romantic delays or social 

regrets may drain your energy early

Horoscopes: 
See what the future holds 
for your birthday 
ContInued from pag_ 12 
this week, Virgo: Expect the vague 
promises of loved ones to now be 
t~mporarily bothersome. All of th is, 
Ironically, is a precursor to expand-
Ing career ideas and new workplace 
negotia tions, Vi rgo. Sta rt preparing 
to leave behind fear, low confi-
dence or past employment restric-
tions. Late Wednesday, vitality 
rap idly increases: Pace yourself and 
watch for fas t business proposals 
or sudden announcements from 
loved ones. 

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
Before mid-week, shorr-term 

relationshi ps or brief love affairs 
may be highly distracting: Expect 
new friends or potential lovers to 
present un usual invitations or rare 
social information. Over the next 
few weeks, however, loved ones will 
also VIC for your time, social atten-
tion and contlllucd ded ication . 
Stay focused : At present, subtle 
octions and public appearance may 
be extremely important in close 
reldtionships. A complex and 
,kmanding week, Libra : Avoid 
romantic triangles, If at all possible. 

Scorpio (Oct . 24·Nov. 21) 
Minor health concerns, infec-

tions or skin irritations are accent -
ed carly this week, Scorp. Before 
Wednesday, expect physical vitali-
ty to be quickly changeable. Stress, 
social tensions or las t-mi nute 
revIsions may now cause delays, 
Scorp. Avoid taking on extra work 
,1r risky projects and all will be 
>'ell. At present, both workplace 
and rllm.rntl c partnerships may 
need to dramatically change to 
,'nsu re success. Remain quietly 
,kdlcJ tcd : Bv early next week oth-
(fS wdl take the lead . 

5qlttartul (Nov. 22·0ec. 21) 
Lovers and close friends may 

strongly disagree th is week, Sage: 
Expect long-term relationships to 
now conflict with new social oblig-
ations. Before next week, loved 
ones will avoid public gatherings 
or rapidly discount the ideas of 
mutual fri ends. Go slow and 
expect unusual social outbursts. 
All passes quickly, Sage, so not to 
worry. Do, however, avoid bold 
public statements or changing 
social opinions, if at all possible. 
After Friday, daily financial stress 
will be lifted: Expect important 
gains. 

Capricorn (Dec . 22·Jan. 19) 
Late Tuesday, Cap, a lover or 

close friend may ask for rare emo-
tional guidance. Key issues involve 
conflicts between relatives, divided 
social loyalties or doubtful roman-
tic parrners. Air may seem small , 
but an alert attention to detail may 
now reflect an imporrant emotion-
al issue. Offer support and comfort, 
Cap: Social and family relations will 
soon regain their balance. After 
Wednesday, watch also for minor 
but an noying messages from past 
busllless associates. Avoid public 
fi nancial discussions. 

Aquariul (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 
Daily confidence and roma nt ic 

attraction are highlighted this 
week, Aquarius. Although work-
place di fferences may now be com-
plica ted by ego battles or small crit-
icisms, many Aquarians will 
approach business decisions with a 
rekindled self-awareness. Romantic 
partnerships may be similarly 
affected, Aquarius: Watch fo r a 
powerful wave of sensuali ty, attrac-
tion and emotional motiva tion to 
arnvc early Wednesday evening. 
Respond quickly to ins tinct , 
AquariUS: Sincere reactions wilt be 
rewarded.

Clinic: 
The number of patients 
at the clinic has increased 
Continued from pae_ 11 
experience that many feel is not 
available on this side of the bor-
der. Being able to walk the 
patients through each step, work-
ing with the doctors and asking 
them questions exposes students 
to many important aspects of 
medical and patient care. 

The patients who come to the 
clinic for treatment are much dif-
ferent than patients you see in the 
United States, according to Ethan 
Egan, current officer for campus 
affairs and future president of 
AED. 

"People down there don't go to 
a doctor unless they seem to real-
ly need it; Egan said. 

When the group went down in 
November, about 10 of the roughly 
15 patients had serious problems. 
One of those patients was a baby 
who was extremely malnourished 
and had severe breathihg problems. 

"You could just hear this baby 
trying to gasp for air: said Asal 
Shoushtari, vice president of AED. 

It turns out that the baby had 
severe bronchitis as well as a bac· 
teria l infection , which prevented 
her from being able to absorb 
food into her body. Fortunately, 
they were able to treat the baby. 

"At the end of the day, to see 
the relief on the mother's face was 
really nice because she had gone 
to so many doctors and finally 
someone was telling her what was 
wrong," Shoushtari said. 

Amanda Lamond, who is in 
charge of running the t linic, once 
dealt with a woman who had 
breast cancer and a pain in her 
spine that they thought migh t be a 
sign that the cancer had moved 
there. They were lucky to have 
fou nd a place nearby tha t was able

to give her X-rays, which Lamond 
then took to the doctor. 

"I was shaking when 1 went 
into the room with the X-rays," 
Lamond said. 

When she informed the 
woman that the cancer hadn 't 
moved, the lady started crying and 
thanked Lamond profusely. 

"I will never forge t that," she 
said. 

Working at the cl in ic has rea lly 
touched the students. It has been 
a learnmg experience, not only 

about health care and medicine, 
but also about the conditions peo-
ple live in elsewhere in the world . 

"I am gaining an understand-
ing of what health care is like in a 
Third World country ... it 's very 
primitive," Lamond said. "They 
don 't have the same opportunities 
that we do here."

CROSSWORD Soapbox: More sentimental 
statements from the chief 
Continued from pag_ 12 
run a great section. 

David Lee, our mysterious 
Hiatus editor, will no longer be 
pushing the I\mits of what arts and 
~ntertainment are. Dave expanded 
the scope of Hiatus to subjects that 
would not be covered by typical 
arts and entertainment sections, 
but he pulled it off beautifully. It is 
likely that the GU11rdian will never 
again have a writer quite like Dave. 

Knowing this, it is safe to say 
tha t the Hiatus section will be a li t-
tle different next year. At its helm 
will be Joseph Lee and Charlie 
Tran. Joe was co-Hiatus editor with 
Dave for most of the year, so he 
will bring the experience needed to 
keep the sect ion running smooth· 
Iy. Joe is also committed to expos-
ing the ugly underbelly of the oft-
criticized San Diego music scene. 
Charlie, now our design editor, will 
bring a new look and feel to 

Hiatus. An avid movie critic and 
fan of the arts, Charlie should sat-
isfy those who enjoy the finer arts. 

The Guardian would be nothing 
without photos, and Photo Editor 
David Pilz has certainly made it 
something. Due to the overall 
quality of Dave's and his photogra-
phers ' work, there have been more 
pictures in this year's issues than 
there have been in a long time. 
When he wasn't out shooting or 
developing, Dave was critiquing 
and improving his photographers. 

For that reason , next year's 
photo editor, Lyon Liew, is more 
than qualified to bring the cam-
pus informative and aes thetic 
photos. Lyon has a firm grasp of 
what photojournalism is, and his 
sports shots have improved to the 
point that they are downright out-
standing. 

Last, but not It:asl. Web Editor 
Brian Wikner is graduati ng. Brian 
was responsible for getting every 
issue onto the Web this year, and 
he's mad.: numerous improve-
ments to the Guardian online edi-
tion. Coming in in the middle of 
the night to post the articles and 

photos online is a thankless job. 
but Brian did it with enthusiasm 
and care. 

Knowing his days at the 
Guardian were numbered, Brian 
trained his replacement, Zh i-Ning 
Liang. to be the next Web editor. A 
computer science major, Zhi-Ning 
should continue to improve and 
add to the Web site, making it more 
interactive and easier to usc. 

All these Guardian editors who 
are gradua ting may just sound 
like names to you, but you r~ally 
do know them. You know them by 
seeing the sections they produce 
week-in and week-out. You know 
them by the articles they write. 
Yo u know them by the phot,ls 
they shoot. 

So get to know the new crop of 
GuardiaTl editors. We're excited to 
carry on the proud tradition l1f 
supplying UCSD with all thl' 
information it needs to b,' thl.'

Shoushta ri said. 

This has been an in tegral year

to get more doctors involved, and 
hopefully the number of doctors

Business relationships, social

clarify early this week, Pisces: 
Watch fo r the bold or obnoxious 
types to no longer create a,n noying 
distractions. For the most part, 
Pisces, this is an indication that 
long-dreaded workplace or finan-
cial changes will be avoided. Some 
Pisceans may also experience a 
similar emotional shift in a close 
relationship. Watch for loved ones 

to let go of negative ideas, family 
criticism or outdated opinions, 
Pisces: Offer genuine support and 
guidance.

UCSD Student Playing Abroad 
Revelle student playing in the Maccabiah Games in Israel 

High Cheer 
By JESSICA SCHEPPMANN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite political unrest in Israel 
between Muslims and Jewish Israelites, 
Jewish athletes will compete in this 
year's 16th World Maccabiah Games in 
Jerusalem in a show of international 
solidarity. 

Included in this year's U.S. volleyba ll 
team for the games is one of UCSD's 
own: Revelle sophomore Edan Wernik. 
The Maccabia h Games are the fourth-
largest international Olympic-style 
event. according to Jordan Weistein , 
chairman of the U.S. Maccabiah Steer-
ing Committee. 

Jewish athletes from ·around the 
world compete every four years in this 
athletic l'vent. According to its 
founders. the goal of the Maccabiah 
Games is to enrich the lives of Jewish 
youth in the United States, Israel and 
throughout the diaspora wi th cultural. • 
athletic and educational programs. Offi-
cials hope that this event will help to 
develop international awareness and 
understanding for Jews. 

Despite apprehension of agitation in 
Israel , this year's U.S. delegation is expect-
ed to bring 26 different teams that Weis-
tein said will include "over 700 athletes 

Track: 
Multiple seniors were on the 
team for several years 
Continued from page 19 
Her performance helped pull other 
people along. She's also one of the top 
academic people." 

Scot! was also one of the top per-
formers for the Triton track team. Last 

and coaches, which would make it the 
largest U.S. Maccabiah team in history." 

There will be competition in three 
categories: junior, masters and open. 
Wernik will compete in the open com-
petition for vo lleyball . 

Wernik, a bioengineering major who 
holds dual citizenship in the United 
States and Israel, has played volleyball 
for over 13 years. He attended high 
school in Jerusalem, participated on 
Jerusalem's "Asah" team, and competed 
in the national league for five years. 

This year's national volleyball team is 
spread out over the entire United States, 
so the team will have just one intense 
week of unified play in Los Angeles 
before traveling to New York and then on 
to Israel. Because of thi s, Wernik is 
required to train on his own to maintain 
fitness at a competitive level. As part of 
his training regimen, j,e currently plays 
for UCSD's club volleyball team. 

Tryouts for West Coast participants 
were held in January in Los Angeles. Past 
teams have included former Olympians 
such as golfer Bruce Fleisher, gymnast 
Mitch Gaylord and swimmer Mark 
Spitz. Although the games are not well-
known in the United States, they are 
extremely popular in Israel. 

The U.S. Department of State recom-

year, she competed in 3,OOO-meter runs. 
This year - the first year that women 
competed in the 3,OOO-meter steeple-
chase - Scott ended up going to 
nationals. 

"She's a talented athlete," Salerno 
sa id . "[Running the steeplechase] says a 
lot about her." 

Masters was a sprinter for the Tri-
tons and competed in 200- through 
BOO-meter events. 

"She's amazingly committed," Saler-

mends that Americans not travel to Israel, 
though it is not prohibited. However, 
Maccabiah Team officials still plan to 
send a large U.S. delegation to the games. 

As a precaution, team officials are 
working with highly trained security . 
experts, the Maccabiah Safety and Secu-
rity Committee, which is composed of a 
brigadier general in the Israel Defense 
Forces and several heads of security from 
different)sraeli state departments. 

Wernik, a former officer who worked 
as a spokesman stationed in the Gaza 
Strip, is not overly concerned with any 
terrorist threats to the games. 

"The goal of terrorism is to scare 
you." Wernik said. "You can't let that 
happen . These attacks or threats of 
future attacks will not discontinue the 
search for peace and will definitely not 
keep me from going this summer." 

The opening ceremonies for this year's 
World Maccabiah Games will take place 
in Jerusalem. The events will be hosted all 
around Israel from July 16 to July 26. 

According to Weinstein, the formula 
for success for this event remains con-
stant, despite the political unrest in the 
area. 

"Sports is the attraction." Weinstein 
said. "The land of Israel is the vehicle. 
Jewish continuity is our primary goaL" 

no said. "She laid it out on the line." 
Johnson was with the team three 

years and established herself in the high 
jump. 

"She was one of our top scorers in 
the high jump," Salerno said . 

Everstein competed in the 400 and 
always gave it her all . 

·She's very committed ." Salerno 
said. "She laid it out on the line. She did 
everything she could with what she had. 
She was very solid ."

Track Graduates Large Class 
Nielsen and Scott head I ist of departi ng sen iors 

Crew Ends the Year 
on a High Note 

By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD track and field 
~eams will be a lot lighter after los-
mg 11 members to graduation this 
month. 

The men's team will lose James 
Nielsen, Man DeFord, Nate Gar-
cia, Joe Basaje, Kennon Kwok and 
Wale' Olagunju. 

On the women's side, Amie Wu, 
Meghan Scott, Erin Masters, 
Nicole Johnson and Carrie Ever-
stein are departing. 

Nielsen is unquestionably the 
tbp athlete of this group. He was 
unstoppable in long-distance run-
ning, dominating the 1.500-meter, 
5,OOO-meter and 10,OOO-meter 
runs. 

"He was Superman in every 
way, from leadership to athletics to 
academics," said track and field 
head coach Tony Salerno. "He was 
a real rare one. He's obviously 
highly intelligent. It's difficult to 
miss that." 

- DeFord, affectionately known 
as Yogi. was a hammer thrower and 
more than just a member of the 
track and field team. He was a 
school leader and always involved 
in many sides of campus life. 

"What event did you not see 
Yogi at?" Salerno said. "I could not 
imagine seeing us in Division II 
without Yogi. He's a tireless worker. 
He sacrificed his own success in 
athletics for the greater good. I 
could not speak highly enou~h of 
him." 

Garcia paled only to Nielsen in 
the long distances, running the 
5,000 meters and 10,000 meters 
and holding his own against the 
competition. 

"He's a great competitor: Saler-

no said. "He bro.ught leadership 
and maturity. Nate is one of the 
people we called upon for some 
unity." 

Basaje was a junior college 
transfer who competed in relays 
and the 400-meter run. 

"He's a tremendously hard 
worker." Salerno said. 

Kwok was a top-notch long 
jumper for the Tritons. 

"He was one of our senior cap-
tains." Salerno said. "He really 
helped bring the team together." 

Olagunju anchored the 400-

meter relay team and sometimes 
ran in the third position. 

"He was a tremendous per-
former, " Salerno said. "You look for 
someone who's fast. He 's a real 
competitor." 

Wu was one of the stars of the 
women 's team. She was unstop-
pable in long-distance events. 

"S he 's an outstanding per-
former in cross country and in 
track," Salerno said. "She's very 
mature and extremely committed.

End-of-the-year success gives 
hope for a bright future 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

UCSD men's crew wound up 
a successful and educational sea-
son last month. 

The year was successful 
because of a number of late 
accomplishments, but it was also 
a slow-starting year because 
younger rowers were still learning 
their way around the boats. 

"We had a really good year," 
said men's crew head coach 
Michael Filippone. "We took a big 
hit last year. We showed our inex-
perience early on, but we kept on 
improving." 

One of the disappointments 
came at the San Diego City 
Championships, but the team 
eventually bounced back. 

One of the year-end highlights 
was when the varsity four boat 
finished third in the Pac 10 
Championships. It was the only 
non-Division I boat to medal. 

Another triumph was the 
novice eight boat, which took sec-
ond in the Pacific Coast Rowing

game, and Allen will still not be a 
leader. 

The only thing this episode 
has accomplished is creating a 

Championships and sixth in the 
Pac 10 Rowing Championships. 

"We are on track to be fast in 
the future," Filippone said. "You 
need experience to return . That 's 
our goal. What I consider a very 
good year, I want to make into an 
exceptional year next year." 

Something new for UCSD is 
its lightweight boats, wh ich are 
also performing well. 

The varsity lightweight fOllr 
finished third at the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Associa-
tion Championships, and the 
novice lightweight four came in 
fourth in the Pacific Coast Row-
ing Championships. 

" It gives guys a chance to row 
that aren't the biggest guys," Fil -
ippone said. "We want to give a 
great rowing experience." 

It was a good year for crew, 
and next year looks to be even 
better. 

"We did not perform as well as 
I would have liked early in the sea-
son," Filippone said. "As the season 
went along, we got faster. The 
squad will be faster next year."

T h~ long road to th~ NBA playoffs is finally cnding. with the Los Angcies Lak-
~rs looking to faCt'off agains t th~ 
Phil,l(klphi,1 76~rs in th~ tinals. 
Looking back, it seeills lik~ the 
playoffs have be~n going on for a 
,'t'IV long tlmL'. 

And whlk the action on the 
courts h.ls b~~n as good .IS eva. 
sc\'t'r<l1 lJlCld~nts h,lVl' bCL'n ovcr-
hyped ilnd have tarnished thiS 
ycar's quest for glory. An example 
is th~ attent ion surroundingJuwan 
Howard's excessivdy flagrant foul 
<111 the San Antonio Spurs' Der~k 
Andnson. 

RL'crn tly, ye t another incident 
has dragg~d out the playoffs and 
prolongl'd the inevitable. The Mil-
waukn' Bucks now claim that the 
;\' BA IS conspiring to ~nsure a 
match b~meen the Lakers and the 
Philaddphla 76ers in the finals. 
Supposcdly. the officials arc giving 
the 76ers the bcndit of thl' doubt 
on close calls. SuppoSL'dly, NBA 
Commissioner David Stern was 
seen cheering for thL' 76ers during 
one of the playoff games. 

What 3 load of crap. 
If I were a member of th~ Bucks 

right now. I would be hanging my 
head in shame. I realize that teams 
arc alw3) s going to have com-
plaints about the officiating, but 
thiS IS ,I n~\\ low. A conspiracy? 
Comc on, IS thiS the, 'BA or "The 
X-riles'?" 

Gr.lIl t~d . the Bucks had better 
players than the 76ers. Ideally, 
they hould have won the series, 
and ea rly on. But instead of whin-
IIlg about the officia ls, who .Ire 
veterans picked by players and 
coaches, th e Bucks should have 
looked at the anemic offense of 
Ray Allcn . Or at the lac k of Icad-
aship from Allen and the Bucks' 
other twO big names. Sa m Cassell 
and Glenn Robinson . Or at the 
Bucks' meltdown in game fo ur. 
blo\\ 111g a 16-point halftime lead. 
Or at the fact that they play like 
five individuals rather than a 
team. Or at the need to rely on 
forearms to the throat, like the 
Milwaukee Bucks' Scott Williams 
did to Allen Ive rson in ga me six. 

If this is the Bucks' reaction to 
losing, I shudder to imagine what 
would happen in the finals. If they 
lost a game to the Lakers, would 
they start crying that Shaq is too 
tall. or that Kobe is too fast? Would 
it be an NBA officials-led conspir-
acy that wants the Lakers to win 
the championship? 

Allen has vigorously defended 
this conspiracy theory. In front of a 
horde of reporters before game six, 
he reiterated his belief and 
answered their questions. What 
they should have asked is if he had 
taken his Ritalin that day. 

The thing is. I fail to see the 
point of the whole farce. The offi-
cials are still going to referee the 
game the same way, the Bucks are 
still going to be inconsistent, Iver-
son is still going to take 30 shots a

Tennis Team Will Miss Seniors 
Two departing tennis players were key components of th,eir teams 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

College athletics is often con-
sidered one of the last bastions of 
pure competition left in this coun-
try. 

This is especia lly true of 
schools that do not participate in 
Division I. For playe rs at these 
schools, the dreams of huge sign-
ing bonuses and l11u lti-year con-
tracts on the professional level are 
slim to none. The only rea l moti-
vation is their love of the game 
and their love of competition. 

Unfortunate ly, one of the 
harsh realities of NCAA athletics 
is that, with few exceptions, play-
ers are limited to four years of eli-
gibility and must move on after 
those four years. 

For this year's UCSD tennis 
programs, th is is true of two players. 

Women's tennis playe r Jaime 
Walker and men's tenn is combat-
ant Cory Moderhak have played 
their final matches at UCSD. 

O ne word that describes Walk-
er is "persevering". She was cut 

- fro m the team her freshman year, 
but continued to work and made 
the team her next season. Walker's 
dedication was one of the traits 
that impressed head coach Liz 
LaPlante from the very begin. in: .. 

Courtesy of UCSD Athletics 

Tennis: Cory M oderhak (left) was a member of the Thtem tennis team 
for two years. Jaime Walker has played the last three. 

"She has improved tremen-
dously over the years, but no mat-
ter what number she was playing, 
she has always worked very hard 
and pushed herself just as if she 
was one of the top players: 
LaPlante said. 

Walker was also known as the 
team 's encourager. She would 
often give important advice 'lI1d 
tips to players before each ma1ch. 

Although Walker's UCSD ten-

nis career is over, she has not 
peaked. 

"She had the highest GPA on 
the team and is planning on going 
to med school," LaPlante said. 

Moderhak played only two 
years for the Tritons, but during 
those two years, he made a huge 
contribution. He came to the team 
last year and immediately became 
the squad's No. 2 player. 

"He was able to go 11-2 at the 

No. 2 position last year and was 
one of the major reasons that our 
team moved up to No. 11 in the 
country: sa id head coach Eric 
Steidlmayer. 

The team began the season 
ranked No. 19. Although Moder-
hak didn 't play much in singles 
this season, he made a tremen-
dous difference in the tea m's 
doubles play. 

"He ended both years playing 
No. 1 doubles, and we will defi-
nitely lose his punch at that posi-
tion," Steidlmayer said. 

Moderhak's biggest win of the -
year was his No. 1 doubles win 
with Jeff Wilson against Cal Poly 
Pomona, which helped secure the 
Tritons' first Division II playoff 
win. 

Steidlmayer also remembered 
the way that Moderhak always kept 
the team's attitude around the 
court as entertaining as possible. 

"I think that he has provided a 
sense of humor to the squad and a 
lightness that will be missed, 
along with his tennis: Steidl may-
er said. 

Moderhak is only a few units 
away from graduating with a 
degree in physics. 

We wish the two departing Tri-
tons luck and thank them for the 
memories they have given to us.
