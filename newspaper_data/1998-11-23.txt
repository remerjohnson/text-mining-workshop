Software to Aid in Comparing 
Protein and DNA Sequences 

Researchers at UCSD and the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center (SDSC) announced the avail-
ability of a web-accessible computat ional tool called 
Meta-MEME last Thursday. This software will help biol-
ogists detect shared features and evolutionary rela-
tionships among the protein and DNA sequence data 
being produced by the Human Genome Project and 
other related sequencing efforts. 

Once a biologist submits a family of similar DNA or 
protein sequences to the Meta-MEME website 
(http://metameme.sdsc.edu) for analysis , the soft-
ware analyzes the information and up to four sets of 
results are e·mailed to the user: the statistical model, 
alignments showing where common features appear 
in the sequences. an alignment showing how the 
sequences are related to one another and the results 
of searching a large sequence database using the 
model. 

The statistical models and analyses produced by 
Meta-MEME can help biologists infer evolutionary fam-
ily trees. uncover previously unrecognized relation-
ships between species or develop experiments to 
determine a protein 's function . 

SDSC is a research unit of UCSD. and is a part of 
the National Partnership for Advanced Computational 
Infrastructure (NPACI). SDSC is sponsored by the 
National Science Foundation through NPACI and by 
other federal and state agencies. as well as the 
University of California. For more mlormation, to to

LOUrt. The ASEs have been able to 
fight the legal battle for their rights 
on Iy because of the Ii naneial assis-
tance of tIle UAW union . 

The UAW. contrary to union 
Opposi lion. is not an "outside agi-
tator" in this issue. The UAW is 
not pushinl! its agenda on the UC 
system. Rather. it is supporting 
the ASE unions because of simi-
lar ideology. The University of

The target of the 
strike Is the UC

As a Peace orps volullleer. 
Hanson learneJ that human need is

"We woulJ dn a who!.: vanety

,he said. "Sometimes we would 
distribute food to differelll villages. 
or we would go on environmental

" We also did a lot III health edu-

said. "I would teadl in English and

A Time for Growth 

Although each Peace Corps vo l-
unteer has a uniqut! experience. 
most vol unteers agr.!e that while 
serving in thc Peace Corps, they 
rccei ved a\ much as they ga ve and 
learned ,1\ much as they taught. 
Hanson is no ,;xt:eption. 

"It \ really Intere~tll1g how mllch 
you learn ahout yo urself' and about 
other people," she ~aid . "I have a 
new mindset now. I sec a lot or peo-
ple here in Amerit:a that think that

As Peal'e Corps volunlecrs, men

" I le ,krned a lot about my limita-

. Lifelong Rewards 

For years, the Peace Corps has 
been known as. "the toughest job 
you'lI ever love." For Hanson, the 

sati~faction or meeting the chal -
knges she fal:.:d a~ a Peace orp, 
volunteer was part of the P.:acc 
Corp~' reward. 

"I can ' t ex pre~s enough how 
~hallenging tht! Pellce Corps is." she 
sa id . "It 's about the people that you 
met , the things that you Jid and the 
experience that you had, but it's also 
about rising to the t:ha llenge. It 's 
about knowing that I lasted through 
two years of servil.:e and three 
months of training. I persevered and 

ro~c to the ol.:casion. I think most 
volunteers overcame th ei r chal -
lenges and rose to the ~hallenge ." 

For men and women who serv\! 
in the Peac\: Corps. one of the life -
long rewards of volunteering is 
knowing that the skills that help 
thl! m succecd as a vo lunteer will 
aIM) help thelll ~ut:l.:eeJ in their 
career. 

"For penpk that want to go into 
the Illedicalfield and jobs like thaI.

"I graduated from college with a

"In college I had worked with at -
risk youth, so that's one of the 
things that qualified me for a posi-

While the Peace Corp~ offers a

Garratt , the Marting two-guard 
rewrded IS point to go along with 
hi, 7 rebound, and 3 ",sist, 
against La Vernt.:. His prt.:,enct.: in 
the lineup will he mi,sed. 

Garratt 's injury is especia lly 
un for tunate because of the u[lCom-

one for the Tritons as they play 3 
games in Ihe next 5 days.

boards and a pair a steals. 

Offensively. senior guard 
Jenessa Bayda led the Tritons . 
posting I I points . Teasdale and 
senior guard Amy McClure each 
had 7 points. Five of M(;Clure's 
point, I.:ame from the line. whert.: 
she was a perfcl.: t 5-5 . 

Early on in the lirst half, Ihe 
Tritons knew il was going to diffi-
cu ll to over(;OITlC a lincr-tuned SI. 
Thomas. The Trilon~ fell hehind 
early. and nlilde strong attempts to 
balanl.:c Oul the lead. But SI. 
Thomas was stronger inside and 
was more consistent from the 
110or. which led to a 25-35 half-
time delicit. 

The Tritons tried to shri nk the 
gap in the second half. but SI. 
Thomas was rolling. SI. Thomas 
wntinued to be successful against 

th~ youngt.:r Tritons, and wn-
trihuted 40 point~ in the sewnd 
half to ea~e into it, 75-47 win. 

Thuugh the loss was (;onvin(;-
ing , the Tritons ~ay they are not 
worri t.:d ahout the rest of the ,ca-
son. They knew going into the 

lI1~tch th~t they were playing a 
Illor.: ex peri <:Jlced ~quad . I nste~d 
of dwelling in the past , UCSD will 
usc this g ~l11e a, a gauge for where 
it wants to he hy the ti 111<: the po,t -
sea;on rolls around . As SI. Thom~, 
will likely he there, the Tritons 
know how th.:y have to perform in 
orda 10 ohtain a berth into the 
Final Four.

early lead, hall led hand to hand 
and then eventually took th e

Yel the Muskies w.::re undaunt-
ed , eVl! n in front of the frenzied 
Triton home crowd. and came out 
strong in Game Two which led to 
an II - IS Game·Two win. 

But as the Triton Pep Band 
played "We 're Not Gonna Take It .. 
on UCSD's home court, in front of 
supportive Triton rans - such ;l~ 
Ihe men \ vo lleyhall team who 
showed up as the ca~ t of South

tcam who dressed like prom 
queens - it heca me ohvious that 
these women were delinitely not 
goi ng to take it. Th.: team came out 
hig and won game three decisivel , 
15-6. 

With a 2- 1 kad. it looked like 
the TI illln, were going 10 the Final 
F ilIII' for til t.: \eclllld timt.: in two

gap to within one pOUlt , 1)- 10. 

The Muskie, tl1<:n had tlnce 
game-point attempts. at 11 - 14, hut 
the resi lient Tritons would not give 
up and eventually scraped out a 17-

"We struggled tonigh t," Head 
Coach Duncan McFarland said. 
"But it wa~ great to win ." 

It wa ... not CSO's mo:-.t well-
played matl'h of the season. hut it 
was one of its harJest-fought games. 
Though the Tritons COIl1Jllilled a har-
rage of service errors - 16 errors to 
the Muskies' 5 - U SO was 
alway~ thcre to make up for thcm 
wi th key hlocks and II ~ervice aces. 

The Muskil!s forced the Tritons 

to ~ter up their game.

Saturday 's Quarterlinal was.: a bat-

expected and made each point a 
war in ibelf. The Muskie~ would

Season Exceeds Expectations It's Catching!!! 
RACE: UCSD has two runners recognized as All -Americans despite loss SPLASH: Water Polo also headed to Final Four 
By Saul Sheridan 
Senior Staff Wnter 

Thl! onl y had thing ahout enjoy-
ing a winning streak is that it even-
tually has to end. suall , the 
longer the wave of triumph 
la~ t s, the harder the wipe-
ou t o f defeat 
hits . At no time 

wa~ thi s idea 
more apparent 
than this weekend at the 

AA Divi:-.ion III I'Os~ 
Country Nati onal Champi() n~hir:-. 
in arli~lc . Pa .. where the Triton 
locllm ltive linaJly dl!railcd. 

After a sea,on fu ll of hard-
fought iClOrie~ and ,u rpri si ng 
upsets at Irvin ' and Stanford, 
not to mention an all1allng perfor-
mance last wee kend to win 
Western Regionab, the Triton 
men's team seemed poised to make 
a serious run at the ational 

hampi ll n ~hips thi ~ weekend. 
However, the 0 victory was 
not to he, as the Tritons ran out of 
gas and linished a distant 21 St 

place. 
Thi~ l"I.:su lt , however. is not 

ind icative of the tcam's ahi lit y or 
desirc. Rather, it reJlects on a good 
team that had a had day at the 

wors t p()~~ihlc mOlllent. 
The Tritons ran hard and 

determllll:d, hut 
the 4n-degree, 
wind condi -
tion~ were Just 

too Illuch ror the Tritons 
tl handle against the lien:est 

competition in the nation. 
"The wcathcr was cold. It ':-
alway~ about 30-40 degree~ co lder 
that we're used to," Head Coach Ted 
'Van rsdale said. "I th ink it may 
have had an ellect on our team." 

The Tritons were not complcte-
I wi thou t good news Oil Saturday, 
however. In spite of the team 's 
overall ~uh - par performam:e, it was 
able to bring home a couple of AII-
Americans. oph more James 

idsen linished 24 th in the men's 
comp ,tition and junior Meghan 
Scott, the only Triton fmm th ' 

women 's team to qualify for 
nati\1nal~. finished 27th in the 
women's division . Both Triton per-
formances were good enough to 
qualify for All -American distinc-
tion . ielsl!n ran thc X,OOO-meter 
cour,e in a time of 25:4 1. 14, whi le 
Scott ran the 5,OOO-l11cter race in 
I X:3lJ .O I. 

"For Ille, persona ll y. it was Illy 
hc~t r.lce 01 the :-ea ... on hy lar." SCOll 
sa id . " It wa~ lDugh competition, I X7 
nillners, everyone of them fa~l. It 
~eemed like l!very second t here was 
~ollleone l:ollli ng in. It was a race 
you had to he mentally tough for." 

Despite the li nal results. !he 
Tritons can look hack on their sea-
son and feel sati slied with them-
se lves. The men 's tea m, in a 
rehuilding year, was not expected 
to have much success, but it capped 
off an ama/.ing season with a WeM 
Regional hampionship. 

"We hall led all year long," Van 
Arsdale said. " We definitely 
exceeded all expectations for the 
scason."
