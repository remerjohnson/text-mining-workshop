Students For Peace Now 
Eligible For . AS Funding 

By Jeff Bensford-Howe 
News Editor 

San Diego Studenta for Peace, tpOntOI'S of 
. l8It week's muaive anti.cfraft rally, took ita fint 
maior step Iut night toward establishing a 
systematized, enduring structure. 

25 people attenclinl an organizinc meeting in 
the North Conference Room decided to become 
a student organization, with 01\1)' studenta .. 
5DSP memben, and not to affiliate .with any 
national 0/1 retionaI anti.cfraft group. 

As a result. AS' President Carlos Montalvo 
pointed out at the meeting, the SDSP wiD be 
elifible to receive funding from the AS CcMmciI, 
an avenue it wiI pursue "81 soon 81 poeaibIe." 

SDSP is currently using money from 
External Affain Commiuioner UncIa Sabo's 
budget. Sabo is a member of SDSP, but.,'t 
lUre how she's going to stretch her budget to 
continue with her external affain programs and 
pay for SDSP activities. 

Some money has been raised 10 far through 
donations. 

The decision to become a student group W81 
unequivocal. 

"We are a student group, and do not endorse 
any non-student group, though we share 
common concerns and will work with them 81 
neceuary," a member said last night. 

Specifically, SDSP decided not to ...

UCSD Indochinese Refugee 
Program Expects 2nd Year 

" Henry Ow Despite eJdreme dernailas on the time of ita 
voIunteen, the Indochinese refugee program is 
IUcceuful and could be carried over into next 

y~.ar, Warren intern coordinator Marilyn 
Wilson believes. 

"We've received indications that ACTION 
(a federal agency) will fund it again •. it's a great 
IUcceu," Wilson says. 

The 19 students here and 40 othen at UC 
Irvine and UCLA are required to work 30 
hours a week with the Cambodian, Vietnamese 
and Laotian refugees, and student. here are 
also asked to submit a major research paper 
each quarter on their work. 

This quarter, the paper is being focused on 
anthropology. Succeeding quarters will 
examine the refugee. &om a sociological and 
political viewpoint. The I'ant ends at the end 01 
tIU calendar year. 

Studenta receive remuneration for their 
efforts •• $324 a month, .Ie. than $2.74 an 
hour .. and four unita a quarter, but the maior 
benefactors are the refuaeea themaeIvea. 

Intem Linda Ruling deac:ri»ea the refugees 81 
"excellent workers; extremely bright," with a 
seIf·motivated bent, both witIm families and at 

. 

families try and stay_together by workint ill 
the same corporation, Ruling notes. 

But that im't always easy. 
Many have had to take job. in auembly 

lines, especially involving computer . paris, 
because thoae jot. require little or no mastery of 
the langua,e. 

And moat are having troubles adjusting to 
the use of English as a main language, intern 
Usa Preston says, and take two or three 
months before they're even ''passable'' in the 
language. 

Intema also are trying to provide services to 
help the ~s adjust to other problema of 
living in a loreign country. They provide 
newsletters, consumer education infonnation 
and health clinics, as well 81 helping them look 
for jobs and homes, and grapple with 
immigration authorities when neceaaary.

Keeping Secrets 
When the University of Southern California was 

IooIcinI for a new praident Iaat year, the preas learned 
that the chairman of the board of AReO was a finalist. 
IMina the conIroveny generated by the new., the 
car-.didNP withdrew from the running. New.1eab also 
created embarraument in the chanceUor lelection 
procell at ue Berkeley. 

To ~ its control of the process and avoid such 
a lituation it'. logical from the point of view of the 
.... r:Iion committee to keep the name. of finali.ts 
IeC1't!t unlit a final selection is made. U campus figure. 
&nd they have le&itimate retervations about the new 
~ or pI •• dent, too bad. 

We hate to .. thiI kind of thinking developing in 
the UCSD chancelor aeJection procea. Yet the 
members 01 the committee, including student 
repr .. entative Cheryl Dunnett, are being 
...... cIiIwiy tiaht-lipped about their preference •. 
Mel ...... dan't even sive the same number when 
........ how many finaIiIta there are. Dunnett, in 
ltd, is -.. crilicized for .,., "isolated" by the very 
... 1'801 Ie.den whoee viewpoints she is auppoaed to 
call')' to the committee. 

We 1I.liwe that each finaIiIt ahouId be uked to visit 
UCSD to ..... wiIh Iludena., ataff and faculty before a 
InaI name iI picked. It micht make it euier for the 
ccamiItee and UC PreIicIent Saxon if UeSD is 
.... anted with a fait accompli, but it could also mean 
we wiI end .. with a c:hanceIIor no one wants. 

TV News 
You can alway. tel the teIeviIion reporten at a 

.... confen!nce. They uk loud, blustery questioned 
aimed at dimicIatint sources rather than P.liciting 
information from them. This goes over big with the 
folea at home who conclude that the reporter really 
knows hit atuff and. is out to protect their interests. 
Unfortunately, reporten who use this technique often 
miaa the point and the new •. 

Y.,aenIay Channel 10 sent Bob Donley to cover a 
prell conference AS President Carlo. Montalvo 

caIlecllo.~ his trip to Washington, during which 
. he and 300 other .tudent body presidents were lobbied 
by President Carter on his draft registration proposal •• 
Donley, instead of a.king questions that would inform 
viewen, haraaed Montalvo, born in Argentina but a 
resident of the US since the early 19601, because he i. 
not a US citizen and thus is not immediately subject to 
the draft. Donley sugge.ted Montalvo did not have a 
right to question Carter's pOlicie •. Never mind that 
Montalvo is the elected representative of UCSD 
undergraduates (the ASUeSD doei not and .hould 
not have a citizenship requirement), or that non-

_ citizen. have the same rights to freedom of speech as 
citizens and even irresponsible TV reporters. Donley's 
line of Questioning suggesll that people who are over 
26 shouldn't have a right to oppose registration, since 
they probably won't be a.ked to pack an M·l, either. 

Other reporters at the press conference said they 
were embarraaed at Donley'. que.tions. They should 
also be indignant that some people .. we hesitate to use 
the work journali.t _. betieve it is more important to 
harasa newsmakera with cheap question. that might 
help boo.t TV ratings than it is to inform viewera.

Medicaid Abortions 
, Upheld by Courts-

WASHINGTON - The 
Supreme Court yesterday 
ordered the federal govern. 
menl to pay for most abortions 
wanted by women on welfare _ 
at lealt until the court decides 
the emotion-laden issue later 
this year. 

In a one· sentence order the 
justices refused to sidetra~k a 
federal judge's order forcing 
the . government to pay for 
medically necessary abortions 
for poor women. 

US District Judge John 
Dooling in New York City last 
month struck down as 
unconstitutional the so-called 
Hyde amendme'nt a 
congressional restriction' on 
Med!caid spen<ii?lg for 
abortJons. The restriction is 
named after its original 
sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde R. III. . , 

Dooling's order that the 
spending restriction end .IOW is 
in effect after the Supreme 
Court, in a 6·3 vote, refused to 
overturn him . 

At the sam(; time the 
justicel voted 6·3 to exPedite 
their consideration of the New 
York City ca.e by consoli. 
dating it with a Hyde 
amendment case from 
Chicago accept~ for review 
last Nov. 26. 

schedule oral arguments in the 
Chicago and New York cases 
for sometime in late April. 

If 10, they will rule 
definitively on the Hyde ' 
amendment'l constitutionality 
by the end of the current tenn 
in JUhe. 

The spending 'restriction 
makes money for abortion 
available only to women 

~ h?se lives are endangered by 
their pregnancies and women 
~ho are the victims of rape or 
Incest. Congress first impoled 
the restriction in 1976, and 
has passed similar versions of 
it since then. 

Hyde condemned the 
Supreme Court's action 
saying the justices had 
usurped congressional power 
to set spending priorities. He 
said the court had restored 
"abortion on demand. " 

The lUinois congressman 
said he was not ready to 
concede that the high court 
would eventually overturn the 
abortion restrictions that bear 
his name, but added, "I don't 
see a great cause for optimillTl 
when a majority of the justices 
reversed the statui quo before 
a full hearing was held." 

Khomeini Okays

TEHRAN - President 
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr of Iran

Ruhollah Khomeini , the

In Tehran to investigate

Bani·Sadr told reporters in

Kurt Waldheim, Wh9 chose

Congress Won't

WASHINGTON - Preli-
de~t Carter's proposal to 
regIster women for the draft

a pointless and expensive

" It doesn't make sense 10

Holt , R.Md., as the opening 
debate on the Carter plan

them in combat arms, I don't

Facing Death, ' and 'All That Jazz' 
By Lynette Tom 

Senior Staff Writer 
Director Bob F Mae haa never been 

known as a conventional filmmaker. In 
Caberet, he set. a love .tory within the 
context of a .leazy showhouse in pre· 
World War II Germany. In Lenn", he 
shed. light upon the volatile penonality 
and .elf--de.tructive lifestyle of the 
famed .tand.up comic. Foue once 
again show. hi. streak for the 
unorthodox in his new fib, All That 
Jau, an off-beat and provocative 
musical . • . about death. 

The plot centen around .Joe Gideon, 
a conaumrnate choreographer and 
director whose life alternates between 
his hyperactive career on the .tage and 
his behind·the-ac:enea convenalionl 
with Anaelique, an aIbinar, but 
unmi.takable, Anlel of Death. 
Gideon' •• euioq with the latta 
upect, penonified by comic Davia 
Newman's eitht minute routine on 
death in the chor8Oll'apher and 
director'. latest film, The Stand Up, 

hes? 

come. close to disturbing reality when 
hi. morning. of Alb Seltzer and 
Dexidrine, hi. days of ciprettea and 
alcohol and his nights of bed-hopping 
lead to a mauive coronary. GideOn'. 
borderline condition often a powerful 
study of one man'. endeavor for 
eerfection, whether it be in a aucx:e .. fu1 
Broadway musical, an innovative 
motion picture as a' perfect lover or 
responsible father, or even an ideal 
death. 

TIle lCl'eenplay, written by Foue 
and Robert Alan Aurthw, is dearly the 
fonner's way of coming to term. with 
hi. own near·fatal heart aBack. Joe 
Gideon is nothing more than a saeen 
alter·ego of the actual artist, from the 
peppered beard on hi. chin, to hi. 
conai.Ient m-eu in black, to the 
omnipresent ciprette drooping from 
his mouth. Another parallel can be 
found in the protaconiat'. former wife 
Audrey Paris and yauns daughter 
MichJla, who .. e styled after Foue'. 
third spouse Gwen Verdon and their 

daughter NicoDe. The ending is 
predictable, with Angelique'. 
pre.ence, Newman'. word., and 
Gideon'. return to hi. old habits prior to 
and after open heart surgery as 
convincing set-upa. It is only a rnatter 

"Oi waitint ... and--w.mn, ... and 
waiting for the inevitable to occur. In 
this reaped, Foue'. direction of the 
film becomes a bit self.indulgent. 
However, this i. negligible compared 
to his courage and wilingne.. to 
project fragments of his life onto· the 
ICreen for all to see. 

With .uch credits as The French 
Connection, JaWl, JoWl II, Marathon 
MOIl, The Seven· Ups, and Sorcerer to 
his name, it is .tartIing to see Roy 
Scheider in a turnabout role u Joe 
Gideon. The raiaed eyebrows and 
,aping mouths soon give way to IIniIea 
and words of p'aiae, u Scheider turns 
in a fint-rate performance that could 
have only been played better by Foue 
himself. Jeaica tange i. perfect as the 
aeduc:tive lady in white, Angelique. 

Am Reinking and Leland Palmer .. e

he mused, by a visionary with a sketch 
book who'd falen in love with the 
purity of the ~a,thematical equation. It 

was an environment where humans 
were a auperflous consideration, an 
afterthought after the plana had been
