University Fee Rise 
in 1979-80. Uncert in' 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate News Editor 

No one knows whether there 
will be tuition in the University 
of California next year becau e 
"Howard Jarvis ... with the 
help of two-thirds of the voters 
of California, has fucked up the 
(UC) budget process," Kevin 
Eckery, an Associated Stu-
dents official, said yesterday. 

Eckery, the Student Body 
President's Council (SBPC) 
representative from UCSD and 
member of the SBPC budget 
committee, said the UC sys-
temwide budget would nor-
mally be submitted for scrutiny 
by the state legislature in early 
January. The legislature would 
then make whatever additions 
or deletions they felt necessary 

nd return it to the University, 
he aid. 

At that point, University 
officials would decide whether 
to impose added fees on UC 
students. This year, though, 
Eckery says the ramifications 
of Proposition 13 ha ve so 
confused state legislators and 

University administrators that 
" They don't know what their 
job is ... Proposition 13 is 
revolutionary in its impact on 
the University budget." 

Eckery ays the tate legis-
lature won't kn6w until June or 
so what the UC budget cuts, if 
any, will be . University of-
ficials are thus faced with a 
dilemma. 

Despite the uncertainty, the 
University has already decided 
on its 1979-80 budget priorities, 
Eckery says, and has estab-
lished a " worst possible case" 
budget. 

This budget plans for the UC 
system losing $20 million for the 
year 1979-80, of which UCSD 
would lose $1.7 million and ten 
faculty members. 

Budget priorities call first for 
a raise in faculty salarie , 
across the board, from thirteen 
to fourteen percent. The second 
priority is the recovery of $15.5 
million of "control cuts " 
mandated by the legislature 
last year. 

"Control cuts" are alloca-

tions made by the state legis-
lature which the Univer ity has 
to return at the end of the fiscal 
year. The money returned to 
the state legislature i officially 
classified as "salary savings," 
but it doe not have to come 
from salary savings, it can 
come from almost anywhere in 
the University budget. 

Last year, the. control cuts 
consisted primarily of $5 .7 
million in student Education 
Fees, which Eckery calls "an 
Ed. Fee ripoff." Those monies 
were supposed to serve for 
financial aid, but were taken by 
the University because .they 
were being held in reserve, then 
one of the few untouched 
reserves in the system. 

Because of the loss of that 
Education Fee money, it might 
not be possible, if the budget is 
cut more heavily than antici-
pated, to meet financial aid 
obligations next year, Eckery 
added. 

The problem is not just 
limited to Education Fees. The

Fees to Increase 1 a Month 

Parking Fees Up 
By Eric Jaye 

Managing Editor 
The rumor that have cir-

culated ince la t spring came 
a long way toward being 
realized Friday afternoon, a 
Chancellor William McElroy 
announced that he was plan-
ning to ask the UC Regents to 
raise the parking fees - though 
by not nearly as much as had 
been expected. 

If the Regents approve McEl-
roy's request. effective Jan . 1, 
UCSD's parking fees will go up 
one dollar per month with the 
exception of Medical Center 
" A" permit which will go up 
two dollars p r month . 

The increa ed fee will be 
u ed , according to McElroy, to 
finance the u e of alternate 

means of tran portation to 
alleviate a conge ted parking 
situation at University Hos-
pital in Hillcrest. 

It had been thought that there 
would be a more dramatic 
increase in fees in order to build 
a $4 .5 million dollar parking 
garage for the hospital. 

The relatively small increa 
i a result, McElroy aid last 
night, of his decision to accept a 
Parking Alternative Ta k 
Force recommendation to 
forestall construction of a 
parking structure. 

However, McElroy said, he 
still feels that a parking 
structure will eventually have 
to be built and that parking fee 
will have to be rais d again .

The Laser: Showy~ Diverse, Useful 
By Doul Campion 

Science Edilor . 
The same laser used to 

mesmerize the audience at a 
rock concert, or to create an 
aura of fantasy on the dance 
floor of a discotheque, coOld 
just as well be used to weld 
together two sheets of steel, 
or, by a surgeon, to make a 
microscopic incision in his 
patient's eye. Often, the only 
di fference in these appli -
cations of the technololY , 
accordinl to the classifi -
cation of lasers by the federal 
government, is how the beam 
of light is focused and where it 
is aimed. 

The lovernment divides 
lasers into (our aroup. ac-

cording to the intensity of the 
light emitted by each. On the 
"weak" end of the scale is 
Class I, into which fall those 
producti whose radiation is 
not strong enough to create 
"biological damage." The 
ranking proceeds up to Class 
IV. Even a diffuse reflection 
of the light beam produced by 
the lasers in this group would 
be strqng enough to burn a 
person's skin or impair his 
power of sight. 

Because the less intense 
lasers are not clearly visible 
in a large room, such a a 
planetarium or a concert hall , 
the designer of lilht shows 
often employ a product from 
Class III or ometime even 

Class IV to ensure spectacular 
visual effects. 

The danger in this choice is 
readily apparent. When the 
light is projected onto a dull 
surface above the audience, 
as is done, for example, in the 
Laserium show at the Los 
Angeles Griffith Park Ob-
servatory, there is little 
chance that injury could 
result. However, there have 
been concerts in which rock 
stars wore highly reflective 
clothing on stage so that laser 
beams directed at them 
rebounded and radiated in all 
direction . In a show such a 
thi , the audi nce has no 
protection from the poten-
tially blinding light. 

Dr. Richard Feinburg, a 
researcher at the Naval 
Ocean System Center 
(NOSC) , worked a great deal 
with lasers in earning his 
doctorate. Although he admits 
that he ha never seen a la er 
light show, he recognizes that 
"the thre hhold for danger in 
this type of thing is very low." 

One of the problems, as he 
sees it, is the lack of ex-
perienced technician op- , 
erating the laser . " ur-
rently, there's no requirem nt 
for u ers of la r. being 
trained, a far a I know." 
aid Feinburg. He add d that 

almost anyon can be ed-
ucated to op rate a la 

properly and to "appreciate 
the danger of lasers." 

In addition to en uring that 
the lighting engineer has the 
necessary background for hi 
ta k, Feinburg said that, for 
safety purposes, "You might 
want to put in mechanical 
canners to keep the beam 

from getting very low." Thi 
precaution would prevent the 
light from coming into direct 

~ontact with the audienc .

Now, over tweaty yean after

Supreme Court, the attacks OIl

much a. eohaoce It: bis 
respODIlbWty for the formation 
and applicatiOll of some of the 
molt far-reachiq court de-
daoaa of this century will not 
be fOflotten. 

lt doesn't take much reo 
search to discover that the or-
gaDization responsible for the 
infamous anti-Earl Warren 
campailD was the John Birch 
Society. In the haDdful of books 
in the Central Library dealiDg 
with the Society, one fiDds more 
references to Early Warren 
tban in a book on judicial 
history. The Society started its 
campaign to impeach Warren 
at its founding meeting in 1958, 
and for years the matter was 
part of the monthly agenda, 
along with trying to get the U.S. 
out of the U.N., winning the war 
in Vietnam, attacking the civil 
rights movement, and abolish· 
ing income taxes. The Blue 
Book of the John Birch Society 
claims that Warren " has 
supported the breaking down of 
our republic to that footstool of 
tyrants known as a democ-
racy ." A speaker in New 
England said, " I would not 
impeach Earl Warren; I would 
lynch him ." Senator Joseph 
McCarthy, hero to Birchers 
everywhere, said" I will not say 
that Earl Warren is a Com-
munist, but I will say that he is 
the best friend the Communists 
have in America ." 

Anatomy of A Protest , the 
Society reasons that Warren 
must be a Communist because 
"be hands down rulings which 
say the Bill of Rights applies to 
American Communists." Com-
munists, obviously, should 
have no rigbts, aDd, according 
to Birchers, neither should 
communist sympathizers, with 
whom tbe society includes 
" modernist ministers," nearly 
all colle,e professors, agents of 
the CIA, the mass media, the 
PTA, the U.S . Chamber of 
Commerce and those sup-
porting civil rights. 

Since the first day someone 
felt there was something to be 
learned from the olber side of 
the hill, from a land totally 
unknown, we have all felt the 
urge to explore . A Dutch 
philosopher once said, "The 
mystery of life is not a problem 
to be solved, but a reality to be 
experienced ." Alan Watts 
continued, "So too, wODder and 
waDder are probably the same 
word." We are all wonderers, 
we've all been led to wander, 
and from lbe enli,htenment we 
seek through our wanderings, 
we've all earned the title of 
pilgrim. We are all on a journey 
of sorts, here, now, today. We 
have chosen to take the freshest 
and healthiest years of our lives 
and dedicate them to pure 
learning: learning from books, 
our teachers and most im· 
portantly, ourselves. As Jong as 
we are curious, we go on living; 
when we stop, we die. 

A Cheap Eurail Pass 

The Birch Society felt that 
Warren ' s leadership of the 
Supreme court led to decisions 
endangering their idea of 
American freedom. One of the 
rulings they condemned was 
Engel V. Vitale , in which 
mandatory prayer in public 
schools was declared unconsti-
tutional. For this Warren was 
labeled an atheist. But much, 

Supporting civil rights was a 
major accomplishment of the 
Warren Court. The monu-
mental Brown V. Board of 
Education of Topeka started 
the long fight against" separate 
but equal forms of segregation 
and brought the power of law to 
what had long been a moral 
issue. The Brown case- was an 
extremely delicate , contro-
versial issue; under Warren 's

Brown and Younger traded 

angry personal accusations 
and smears in their second

Most of the debate was 
devoted to repetition of all 
positions. But they were stated 
in harsher, more personal

DUBLIN, IrelaDd (AP) -
The Provisional wing of the 
Irish Republican Army voted 
Sunday to ask its Protestant 
enemies in Northern Ireland to 
join in seeking a British 
withdrawal from the strife-tom 
province, IRA sources reo 
ported. 

They said the proposal was 
approved at the annual con-
ference in Dublin of the Pro-
visional Sino Fein, the political 
arm of the militant Provi-
sionals. 

According to the sources, the 
Provislonals want to enter into 
talks with Ulster Protestants 
that could bring about a 
removal of Britain from the 
British province and prepare 

the way for a permanent 
settlement. 

At least 1,866 persons have 
been killed during the last 10 
years in fighting between 
extremists of the mostly 
Roman Catholic IRA and 
Protestant groups. IRA Pro· 
visionals have vowed to oust the 
British and join Northern 
Ireland and its Protestant 
majority with the Republic of 
Ireland, which is predomin· 
antly Catholic. 

The traditional Protestant 
stand has been to remain part 
of Britain's United Kinsdom, 
but several leaders recently 
have been critical of British 
rule and ha ve proposed inde-
pendence for Northern Ireland.

Arguing that "we need a boss 
lady in the White House," 
Margo St. James, founder of a 
prostitutes' rights organiza-

1980. 

Ms. St. James, who organized

annual Hookers' Ball, a gala 
honoring the contributions of 
prostitutes to the American 
lifestyle. 

The 15,000 people in the 
audience were dressed for the 
occasion - some as female 
impersonators, nashers and 
belly dancers. WomeD who said 
they were real hookers were

tively dressed. 

The gala, to raise money for a 
campaign to decriminalize 
prostitution, was moved to

under investigation , repeated 
his claim that Sillas "is foot· 
dragging , is sitting on an 
investigation" and that Brown 
and Bell are not doing anything 
about it. 

Younger quoted a Bell letter 
refusing his demand to remove 
Sillas in which Bell said, 
" We' re moving on this in an 
orderly fashion. We ' re fol· 
lowing leads." 

"You know , that sounds 
remarkably like former U.S. 
Attorney General John Mit· 
chell 's comments in 1972 when 
he was asked about the alleged 
Watergate break·in ," Younger 
said _ 

.. And of course, we have all 
the makings of another Water· 
gate here. And all that Jerry 
Brown has to do is call his 
friend Sillas ... and say 'Friend 
Sillas, I want you to complete 
this investigation.' " 

In response, Brown said he 
had no personal knowledge of 
the investigation, but that he 
believed federal investigators 
took it over to "clean up what 
basically are state violations" 
which Younger failed to prose-
cute. 

us Might 
Lose Arms 
Advantage 

WASHINGTON (AP) - The 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff says the strategic mili· 
tary advantage over the Soviet 
Union is steadily disappearing 
and there is " a very clear 
danger" the United States 
could faU behind in lbe 1980s. 

Gen . David C. Jones. in an 
interview in the edition of U.S. 
News & World Report maga· 
zine published yesterday, said 
that while there is a general 
balance now between the two 
superpowers, more attention 
should be paid to future trends. 

"There 's too much unwar· 
ranted pessimism about to-
day's balance and not enoUlh 
gE-nuine concern about pros· 
pective imbalance in the 
~980s, " Jones . said. " I'm not 
su"estln, any craah pro-
grams. I'm not trying to sound 
the alarm. But we oUlht to 
realize that as lona liS the 
Soviets are continuin, to 
pursue an upward line in 
defense expenditures, we

Isaacs Gets Sea Grant Award 
John Iaaaca. director of the 

Institute of Marine Resources 
at Scripps Institution of Ocea-
nography, was recently hon-
ored with the highest award , 
given by the Sea Grant Associa-
lion (SGA). 

In presenting the award, the 
association commended Isaacs 
for his "innovative contribu-
tion! to Olan's understanding of 
the world 's oceans." 

"I can think of no other 
marine-oriented person in the 
country wbo so clearly ex-
emplifies the action element of 
trying to put our best marine 
science and engineering to 
work for the benefit of man-
kind," said Dr. William Q. 
Wick, president of the SGA. 

In addition to serving as the 
director of the Institute of 
Marine Resources, Isaacs also 

teaches courses in oceanog-
raphy at Scripps and is a 
member of the National Aca-
demy of Sciences and the 
National Academy of En -
gineering, 

Three students of the Uni-
versity of California were also 
presented with awards by the 
SGA at the meeting which was 
held in Portsmouth , New 
Hampshire. The students - one 

This is one of the many exbibits on display at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Open House last weekend at the Fisberies Center near Scripps Institution. The 
NOAA research is used to determine optimum fishing quotas for the fishing industries. A

GOy't EKamining 
Safer Laser Use 
(Cont. from page 1) 

"I think the laser has great 
potential for entertainment 
purposes," said Feinburg. He 
added that although a certain 
degree of safety must be 
insured, "You don't want to 
overreplate the thing." 

The Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) is cur-
rently examining lasers and 
their use in entertainment. In 
addition, the American Na-
tional Standards Institute has 
established a set of regula-
tions whicb have be.en adopted 
voluntarily by many laser-
light show engineers. 

Steve Tearny, a laser 
operator at the Space Thea-
ter, emphasized that the 
program is an educational 
demonstration, and not a ligbt 
show, like Laserium. Nor is 
the four-watt laser a totally 
harmless one, according to 
Teamy. (By comparison, all 
of the colorful antics per-
formed in the Laserium show 
are created with a one-watt 
laser.) In this demonstration, 
Tearny uses the beam of light 
to slice a sheet of paper and to 
drill a hole through a piece of 
plastic. 

from UC Santa Cruz, and the 
other two from UC Berkeley -
were among seven such award 
recipients . 

The SGA was established in 
1966 as a network of colleges 
across the United States 
dedicated to conducting re-
search, educational activities 
and advisory services con-
cerning the use of resources 
from the oceans of the world. 
Subjects currently being 
studied by the colleges of the 
SGA are waste management, 
fisheries and aquaculture , 
energy and ocean engineering. 

The SGA is funded in part by 
the National Sea Grant Pro-
gram, by the state of CaliCornia 
and other "non-federal" 
sources, The budget for the 
program at the University of 
California alone is $4 .6 million 
per year.

Bill Bridle, the manager of 
the Technical Services Office 
at the Reuben H. Fleet Space 
Theater in Balboa Park, said 
that many precautions are 
taken in presenting the 
theater's laser "demonstra-
tion." Speaking about the 
FDA investigation of laser 
safety, Bridge said, "We are 
probably stricter than they 
want us to be." He added, 
" Before they were even 
worried about it, we were 
worried about it." 

H Teamy's four-walt laser 
is so much more than just 
another lighting technique, 
then the potential must be 
multiplied in considering the 
two 16-watt argon lasers used 
by radio station KGB in its 
"Sky Show" for the past two 
years. The light has to be that 
strong in order to be seen in 
the outdoor music-and-Iight 
concert, according to Rick 
Leibert, who is in charge of 
arranging the annual event, 

bicycles for ~9itane 
Bridge explained that three 

university professors and a 
technician from General 
Dynamics examined the 
apparatus and proposed 
safety measures to be adopted 
for ita' use. The demonstration 
utilizes a four-watt argon 
Iaaer wbleb it operated bebind

Asked if the lasers were 
constructed (or entertai n-
ment purposes, Leibert re-
sponded, " No, I don't know of 
any designed specifically for 
this." He said that at the time 
of the planning and execution 
of the early Sky Shows, such 
performaaces were an en-
tirely new use of the technolo-
gy, "There was DO particular

teal Over to-See the'Robber' l 
By JnII LMIIe BaeIey 

~""U_ 
"We Bever would stand here 

and He in your face ... " Imagine 
tbat refrain sung by the 
twanging voices of ten Loretta 
Lynns and ten Conway TwitsYs, 
and assume that the statement 
is completely untrue. Then you 
will be well on your way to 
understanding, "exactly how it 
happened once upon the 
Natchez Trace." 

"Once Upon the Natchez 
Trace" is the opening number 
of The Robber Brideeroom DOW 
playing at the Old Globe 
Theatre in the Spreckels. The 
song exemplifies the country-
western/bluegrass spirit of the 
musical - up-front , heart-
rending honesty hanging like a 
see-through shower curtain in 
front of a whole pack of lies, 
whoppers and stretchers. The 
altitude of these fibs is in the 
grand tradition of the fairy tale 
- the communication of them 
is pure Nashville. 

diaJUise. 
If the pretentiousness and 

pseudo-Intellectualism of pop 
and rock music has forced you 
more than once to aim your 
punching finger at the KSON 
button on your car radio as you 
cruise restlessly down the 
freeway you will be nicely 
accustomed to the country-
western flavor of The Robber 
Bridegroom. If not, the music 
takes some getting used to. The 
first time I saw a production of 
this show, in Los Angeles, I was 
skeptical - I thought the music 
was trash . What I didn't 
understand at the time is that 
country-western music is 
trashy. Now I see that as its 
virtue. 

In this way, I consider The 
Robber Bridegroom to be a 
remarkable musical. Its prem-
ise of dishonesty and fairy-tale-
ism is interestingly counter-
pointed by a naturalism of 
speech ("i f you come back 
without an apron full o( herbs, 
you ' ll find your butt up between 
your shoulder blades" ) and a 
better than average musical 
score. 

The Old G lobe production, 
directed and choreographed by 
Jack Tygett, 'is a fast-paced, 
banjo-pickin ' delight. The 
musicians and actors are 
onstage throughout the show 
and as performers (as opposed 
to characters) they do not . 
disguise themselves . This is in 
keeping with the play's tension 
between honesty and dis -
honesty. 

Similarly, the actinl, stnainl 
and dancing are, for the most 
part, well-done, clever and 
amusing. Brian Mitchell plays 

the rakiab Jamie with a spirited 
presence, and the quality of the 
rest of the performances foHow 
suit, with one really · virtuoeo 

display in the number "Deeper 
in the Woods." My only com-
plaint is with Rosamund, 

( .............. 11) 

The Robber Bridegroom is a 
love story based on a novella by 
Eudora Welty, a sort of country 
and western Snow White. The 
hero, Jamie Lockhart , dis-
guised as the " bandit of the 
woods," is a compulsive thief 
a nd is not satisfied with 
anything if it is given to him -
he must Sleal it. This includes 
women, and this is what he 
does: he kidnaps the heroine, 
Rosamund, and to enjoy him-
self to the full , knocks her out 
before he makes love to her. 
(Isn't there a country song, 
" Stolen Kisses?" There has to 
be.) Anyway, there isn't much 
in it for Rosamund, butJ amie is 
content, and the rest of the play 
has to do with the maintenance 
(via berry stai·ns) of his 

The instrumental music, 
which is predominately blue-
grass, is played exceptionally 
well, judging from the reaction 
of audience members who 
presumably knew better than I. The Old Globe prod action of The Robber Bridel(l'OOm.

Leaguer 
Is Kate 
Kate Bush - The Kick Inside 
(EMI-America) 
If this album is as personal as 

it seems, Kate Bush must be a 
rather strange lady. Her voice 
can shift in a single song from a 
girlish soprano to a throaty 
rock growl. Her lyrics are often 
mystically obscure and her 
tunes meandering. But on the 
whole Bush is very compelling, 
even i( a little weird . 

Bush 's most charming qual-
ity is her spacey enthusiasm for 
God, sex and life in general, in 
contrast to the de pressing 

, reflections offered by most '70s 
songwriters. "Feel It" and "Oh 
To Be In Love" are a woman's 
celebration of pure sensual 
pleasure. On "Kite, " a calypso-
style number about the sensa-
tion of rIlght , Bush 's voice 
appropriately soars and 
swoops freely . Best of all is 
"Wuthering Heights," a gothic 
romance tour de force. It was a 
Number One hit In Bush's 
native Britain not long alO and 
deserved to be. .

Noisy Crowd Not Enough in Polo Loss 
By Jon Goetz 

S&aff Wrtler 
About 250 rowdy spectators 

accepted water polo coacb 
RUBS Hafferkamp's invitation 
to .. kick hac. in the stands with 
a Six-pack" at last Friday's 
game versus Arizona and 
cheered the Tritons on to a well-
played 11-14 loss. 

Arizona jumped out to a 7-0 
lead early in the first quarter, 
paced by Jerry Breen's five 
goals in those first seven 
minutes . The Wildcats com-
pletely extemUnated the UCSD' 
offense , pressuring them 
throughout the pool and not 
allowing the ball inside the four 
meter mark . The Tritons only 
managed one attempt at the 
goal and goalie Mike Castaneda 

easily blocked it. 
Though it looked as if UCSD 

was headed for one of the worst 
water disasters since the 
Titanic, the boisterous nata-
torium crowd wasn't about to 
give up . Their thunderous 
chants and applause brought 
the bome team, presumed dead 
in the first period, back to liCe. 

"The noise of the crowd 
really gets your adrenaline 
flowing," said Dan Crane, who 
went out in the second quarter 
to score his team's first two 
goals on Arizona ejections . Kai 
Loedel and Mark Gordon each 
added another point to bring the 
fans to their feet in a frenzy . 

The Wildcats, alarmed at 
seeing their seven-point lead 
shrink to three, settled down 

and raised the score to 11-4. 
Greg Maletis, with five seconds 
left in the half, put the ball in the 
canvas for the fifth UCSD goal. 

Crane and Loedel scored 
again in the third quarter, but 

.the Wildcats, quick as their 
name implies, fast-breaked 
their way to a 15-7 lead. 

The Tritons went out in the 
final quarter with renewed 
crowd support and rallied back 
16-12 on two goals by Crane, and 
the scores of Dan Eby, Toby 
Raymond and Loedel. Arizona, 
however, ended the rally and 
the game at 18-14. 

For students alJeded to have 
no school spirit, the Triton fans 
e Hec tively motivated the 
players. "UCSD has got a helJ 
of a crowd . We want more 

support like this," said Eby. 
" It 's great 10 hear them when 
we' re far back," added Lcedel. 

If there is such a thing as a 
good loss, Friday's was an 
example. " It's good to be within 
four goals of the number five 
team in the nation ," said 
}{afCerkamp. " I hope we use 
this as an education." 

On the next morning, how-
ever, came a couple of ex-
amples of a bad loss. 

Team captain Tom Jorgen-
sen put in his team's only two 
goals in an 8-2 battering by Cal 
Poly Pomona. The entire team 
only took six shots in the game 

That afternoon the Triton 
again dove in the pool to play 
against Occidental, again 
losing. Eby scored the only 

UCSD goal in the first half, 
while the defense was picked 
apart for five Oxy scores . The 
Tritons ' second half sloppy 
passing, poor shoot ing and 
offensive turnovers gave the 
visiting team as easy 11-2 win. 
Mark Gordon scored the other 
UCSD point in the third 
quarter.

Men Take Third Straight 
For the first time in three 

years the UCSD men 's cross 
country team has gone un-
defeated ip all dual meets, 
including the latest one last 
Friday afternoon against Cal 
Tech, Tijuana Tech and USIU. 

With a convincing 24 to 43 
point spread between the 
Tritons and their closest 
opponents, Cal Tech, UCSD 
closed its home dual season 
with three strong victories. 
Last, weekend's trouncing of 
PoiIIIt Lorna and the previous 
week's win over Whittier 
account for the other'two home 
triumphs. This leaves the team 
unbeaten in competition a-
gainst other NAIA District III 
opponents going into the final 
big month of the cross country 
season. 

Lead by Doug Jacobson's 
winning time of 27: 42 for the 5.1 
mile course, a new record (or a 
Triton runner, UCSD had four 
runners under 29 minutes and 
nine runners under 30 minutes. 
As a team, they dropped a total 
of 5 minutes, 39 seconds off 
their combined time a week 
ago. 

" The steady improvement of 
all our runners is extremely 
encouraging, especially since 
we did hard interval work-outs 
on Monday and Wednesday of 
last week," remarked coach 
Andy Skief. "Times will really 
come down when we start to 
ease up before our final races." 

These final races include the

U Athletic Conference 
Could Form in Two Years 

NFL Standings 
American Conference 

East 
T Pct. PF PA 

By HeDry J, DeVries 
Physical Education Depart-

ment Chairman Howard Hunt 
predicts that within two years 
the UCSD Intercollegiate 
Athletics Program will join an 
historic all University of 
California conference. 

"There is no other such 
conference in the United 
States," says Hunt. As cur-
rently discussed, the con, 
ference would consist of all UC 
undergraduate schools ex-
cluding Berkeley and UCLA. 
"We all have the same aca-
demic standards. the same 
goals, and are basically the 
same site . It would be a 
natural, .. Hunt went on to add. 

The formulation of a UC 
conference will be discussed at 
tbe Nov. meeting of the 
University of California Inter, 
collegiate Athletics Board 
(lAB) . The lAB consists of 

faculty and student repre-
sentatives from all of the UC 
campuses. 

"UC President David Sax-
on's office is enthusiastic." 
states Hunt. "They seem ready 
to support this type of con, 
ference.·· 

The conference would be 
made-up of Santa Barbara, 
Santa Cruz. Riverside, Davis, 
Irvine and San Diego. All six 
schools would agree not to offer 
athletic scholarships. Thus the 
conference will allow for 
equitable competition between 
the schools. 

"It·s a need we've faced since 
we started our intercollegiate 
program in 1965." says Hunt. 
Although the idea has been 
considered for over ten years, 
certain factors are now making 
it a very attractive proposition 
for many other schools. Most 
schools want to remain highly 
competitive while doing away

with expensive athletic schol, 
arship programs . The UC 
Conference will allow the six 
UC schools to do just that. 

" I still see some problems." 
states Hunt. " butl don' t believe 
these problems are unre-
solvable." One problem with a 
UC conference would be that of 
travel. The six schools are 
spread out over the state, 
thereby making trips very 
expensive. Various solutions 
are being offered. One would be 
to have compatible sports 
travel together and play 
various sports on the same day. 
Another would be to have 
northern and southern road 
trips where a team would play 
several games in the course of a 
few days. 

One monetary saving from 
the proposal would be the 
elimination of the All -Cal 
tournaments. Because of the 
conference, there would be no 
need for tournament compe-
tition between the UC schools. 
The All-Cals were started in 
1965 with 3 events. There are 
now 21 All-Cal tournaments per 
year with an average of six 
campuses participating in each 
event. Hunt feels the savings 
could be applied to the new 
expenses inherent in starting 
up a UC conferehce.

Parking Fees 
(Conl, from page I) 

" I just don ' t think most 
people will give up their cars. " 
McElroy said last night in 
expressing doubt that the 
alternative means of trans-
portation wiD work. 

The plan calls lor people who 
work and study at University 
Hospital to use "park and ride 
shuttles ." van pools and 
"orbital cruisers" to bus stops. 

McElroy said that he would 
evaluate the situation again in 
the spring to determine if the 

plan was working. 
However, McElroy said that 

he thought the plan would not 
work and that there would be 
another fee increase, perhaps 
as early as the fall of 1979. 

The fees could go as high, 
according to McElroy, as those 
at' UC Los Angeles and UC 
Berkeley. 

Those fees . the highest in the 
system. are both close to $100 
per year, McElroy said. Cur-
rently students pay $36 per 
year, faculty $72 and sta ff $60. 

'Bridegroont' 
(Conl. from pqe') 
portrayed by Edith Taylor 
Hunter, who could ha ve per, 
formed less like Bever ly Sills 
and more like Dolly P arton. 

Robert Green's down-south 
backyard set is charming. and 
also realistic, but the raked 
stage, which is an a bsolute 
necess ity in the Spreckels, 
made me very nervous because

I kept thinking the performers 
would slide off it. And in fact. 
one actor a lmost did end up in 
someone's lap. 

Othe r wi s e , I tho'rough ly 
enjoyed mysel f at the Robber 
Bridegroom. We are lucky to 
have a musical of such high 
quality produced in San Diego 
and 1 recommend it to anyone 
who is not completely pu t off by 
country and western.music and 
its accompanying philosophy of

UC system Eckery says, "has 
gutted its reserves. If asked to 
use its own resources to cover 
lowered state support, it will 
not be able to cover it." 

Eckery emphasizes th a't 
whether the fees rise will 
ultimately depend on the 
amount of budget cuts inflicted 
on the Univers ity . " E very 
administrator has a limit on 
how much can be cut. "above 
that limit. he'll want to impose 
tuition ... 

In the meantime, Eckery 
says there will probably not be 
too ma.ny new programs in the 
UC system. Systemwide ad-

Lasers 
(CODl, from pale $) 
explained, " When it comes to 
getting 'permission' - no. I 
don't need anybody's 'permis-
sion.' I just tell them what I'm 
gOing to be doing." He men-
tioned that because the light 
beams were to be used out-
doors. he had contacted the 
Federal Aviation Agency so 
that they could anticipate the 
lasers in their routi ng of 
flights in the area.
