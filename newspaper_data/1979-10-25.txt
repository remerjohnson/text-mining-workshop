The an Onofre nuclear power plant 

continues to generate more than just 
electricity. The controversial plant will 
be the focus of a major anti -nuclear rally 
Nov. 10 a t Doheney Beach State Park. 
seven miles north of the San Onofre site. 

The rally is being sponsored by th 
Coalition to Stop San Onofre, a coalition 
of the Community Energy Action 
Network. the Southern California 
Alliance for Survival, Greenpeace, the 
Campaign for I::conomic Democracy. 
a nd CaIPIRG. 

"The main purpose of the Coalition is 
to raise money to intervene by court 
action in the licensing of San Onofre 
reactors two and three. whi 'h goes 
before the Nudear Regulatory 
Commission in June, 1980." 

"The rally itsdf focuses on an 
Onofre, and our aim is to stop the 
licensing of reactors two and three and 
force the decommission of reactor one. 
but our overall goal is reflected in th title 
of the rally. 'San Onofre: W Can Stop 
Nud ar Madness Here ... · said 
Hodgson . 

.. I he San Onofre nuclear power plant 
has been a hotbed of controversy sin 'e it 
began operations in 1968. The plant is 
1000 yards from an adive emthqllakt> 
fault arid is also proximal to the an 
Andreas, 

The plant has also been under allack 
for its frequent shutdowns as a result of 
mechanical failures, a nd its pipes are 
reputed to be some of the most corroded 
of anv nuclear I><>w~r plant in the nation.

Despite all the on-stage cooperation, the dramatic arts, can be a 
competitive, bakc-stabbing endeavor. In an attempt to dIspel that 
attitude and creat a supportive environment, GUTS (Group of 
Undergraduate Theater Students) has formed on campus. 

GUTS is to be a group where undergraduate drama students 
can share their resources and talent, according to Lisa Wolpe, 
founder of GUTS and a fourth year drama student. 

"We're not trying to tear apart the department," commented 
Wolpe, "but to add undergraduate strengths and initiative to il." 
Wolpe say she has received only positive feedback from the rest 
of the drama department. 

GUTS member T arquin Cardona claims that "a lot of 
undergraduates felt they weren't being recognized by the 
department; they felt slightly rejected." GUTS, says Cardona. 
was fonned to "go above and beyond the existing program ." 

Drama Department Chairman Michael Addison is "very 
pleased" with the development of GUTS, he sees it as a "natural 
evolution of the department," and he says he willtr)' to support 
them in every way. 

Over the course of this academic year, GUTS will be offering 
worktlhops to drama students in such areas as audition 
techniques, text work- on Shakespeare, and street theater.

'Pro-Choice' 
Coalition Will 
Rally Friday 

8y Sam Gooch 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD phase of the "pro·choice" 
publicity counteroffensive will conclude 
tomorrow with a rally featuring speakers 
supporting public aid for women who 
choose to have an abortion. 

Several important issues concerning 
abo rtion , induding theolo g ical 
perspectives. political implications, 
health topics. and planned parenthood ., 
will be addressed by a panel of six 
speakers tomorrow morning a t 11 :30. 

The ra lly , to be held on the east ' teps 
of the UCSD Gymnasium, will a lso 
feature the folk band "Bread and 
Roses ." 

Gracia Pick of the Abortion Rights 
Action Week Steering Committee will 
speak on the goals pro-choice supporters 
hope to fulfill. 

"Pro-choice should not necessarily be 
equated with pro-abortion," says Dail 
Bacon, an organizer of the rally and 
UCSD Women's Center collective 
member. "We want women to have an 
educated freedom of choice in dealing 
with their own pregnancies; abortion i,;; 
just one of many alternatives."

'Nice Hands, Vince' Bumps, Spikes and Wins 
By Tun Liotta 
Staff Writer 

The cralh of the lurf is replaced by the echoes of 
rebounding ahota. The sand beneath the players' feet 
il replaced by a synthetic or wooden floor. Despite 
these changes from the "natural" habitat for the 
game of volleyball, the intramural program at UCSD 
manages to provide it will all of the excitement of the 
beach veraion. 

Volleyball in Southern California is quit~ a 
compehtive sport. Kids grow up playin!( volleyball 
with the same fervor that goes with baseball or 

football in other part. of the nation. Despite the lack 
of national television coverage, the beach lifestyle 
seems to draw beachgoers to the game. And really 
now, could football boast the same attraction? 

Even the names of the intramural leagues 

Laguna Beach league, Ocean Beach league, or 
Munhalliln Beach leilgue - emphasize the game's 
home . 

There are over 50 1M teams in the coed volleyball 
leagues and some teams adapt to the indoor 
surroundings better than others. 

"Nice Hands, Vince" has taken to the 1M game 
like they invented it. '!"hey'v!' won each of their tlnet' 
AA cllntests, losing only om' game in till' pmn·ss. ' 
Em'h mall'h is a hest IIf thrt't' contest. 

"For the amount of time we've spent playing 
together, the team works extremely smoothly," says 
Janae Askew, who doubles as the teams leading 
server. 

'me team 's leader, captain and best a11·around 
player is John Comfeld. He's brought togehter a 
team which sports a specialist in each of the 

necessary departments. 
The pallern of Kerry Muse selling up the spikes 01 

Rick Jaye has been the basis for their offensive 
attack. But a team (annot survive on spikes alone. 
Rob Grammy is looked upon as the team's best 
bumper. He specializes in starting the rally which 
tlwy hOjll' to sl'l lIJl to .IaYI' , 

'Ine team plays with enthusiasm and spirit , and 
Julia Ward _ms to be their 1I0uree of inspiration in 
that department. 'Ine lineup is rounded out hy Vince 
Askey, the UCSD varsity bilseball coach. He's the 
one with the nice hands. 

"We've done !-lreat so far, " notes Jamie Askew. 
'Ihe air of wnfidence displayed by the team is 

coupled with a "one game at a time" attitude, which is 
refreshing after all the teams which win a lew !-lames 
and bt'gin to feel hi !(·headed ,

'Supersports' Are 
Only 'Intramuralish' 

But Winners Go To Next Level 
Thi ' aturday 's " Super. 

sports" competition a t UCSD 
is designed for the basic 
intramural athl e t e 
intercollegiat e a thletes aren't

the type of competition found 
at a wmpany picnic than 
co llegiate contest. "The y're 
good intra muralish ty pe 
events," says Swll Herndes 01 
Ihe Recreation staff. 

Hut Budweiser, the sponsor 
of this event and hundreds like 
it nationwide, take ~ it 
seriously. '111e top two teams 
a t the UCSD contest get 
outfitted in uniforms supplied 
by the beer company and sent 
to a city.wide competition at 
Mission Hay later in the 
quarter and compete against 
teams from San Diego State 
a nd University 01 San Diego. 
The winner at Mission Bay 
advances to the contest in 
Tempe, Arizona. All 
expenses, including lodging, 
air fare, food, and 01 course 
beer. are picked up by 
Budweiser at the top levels of 
competition. 

Winners of the regional 
contests in the first two years

of the contest were flown to

touche the silver·mesh la mee 
that covers the stomach and 
chest of each fencer . In 
competltron , five scores 
against a fencer, in any event, 
are required to win a bout. 

lne epee is also electrically 
scored, but the swords used 
are much heavier than foils, 
and ha ve rigid 35 inch blades 
with no culling edge. The 
triangular blade of \he epee is 
fluted , and tapers to a sharp 
point that is blunted with a 
metal stop. The whole body is 
a target in epee bouts, rather 
than just the trunk, as with the 
foil. 

Dueling with the foil or epee 
is pretty much a thrust and 

parry event, but with a sabre 
the event becomes much more 
like the duels we all used to 
watch on Zorro , The 
combatants slash and lunge 
about like it's for keeps, lnis 
sword is longer (41 ") than the 
epee or loil , and has an arc 
shaped guard and tapering 
flexible blade of fluted H· 
section with a full cutting edge, 
Competition limits the target to 
the body above the waist, and 
judges score the matches 
rather than electric devices. 
Cutting or slashing hits are 
counted, as well as thrusts. 

This year's sahre team is an 
"a ll for one and one for all" trio 
who all share the same last 
name. Greg and Donovan Lee 

are brothers, but Andrew Lee 
is unrelated. Althou!/h 
Andrew is in his fifth year with 
the team, and Greg is in his 
fourth, Imth ilW~ that the 
relative inexperience of the 
team will hurt the team, 
because fencing is a sport that 
takes some time to learn, 

Graduations and defections 
to the European fencing circuit 
have cost the team this year, 
hut the Tritons will be well 
coached. at least, under the 
direction of M<trk Haskell and 
Jim White. Haskell is a former 
AII·American and Hig. IO 
champion at Michigan State, 

, and White is a master lencer of 
some repute. Haskell

You Can't Take It With You 

But Globe Helps 
By Beth Accomando 
Senior Staff Writer 

Moss Hart and George S. 
Kaufman collaborated on a 
number of plays including 
Once in a Lifelime and '{he 
Man Who Carm' 10 Vinner. 
However , their best·loved 
work is probably You Can 'I 
Talle II Wilh You, an 
enduring play that won the 
Pulitzer Prize in 1937 a nd 
then became an Oscar 
winning movie by Frank 
Capra in 1938. This year the 
Old Globe Theatre (working 
out of the California Theatre) 
opens its season with a 
delightful production of this 
classic American comedy.

San Diego's Snails ClaiDl ·Punk Can Be Fun 
By Beth Haas 

Much more than another 
Punk Rock band, the Snails 
have that extraordinary, hard·

them something special. Their

everyone, not just the usual 
fo llowers of Punk ba nds_ Dave 

- Farmer, bass player of the 
S nails, defines Punk Rock as 
music dealing mostly with " the 
c.: ulture and pulitic.:s of the

Water Picture Shows Nature o.f NC W Plan 
By Thomas C. Shepard 

Jack Nicholson is a seedy priva te investiga tor , 
scrounging for clients in L.os Angeles during the last · 
years of the great depression. He meets Faye' 
Dunaway, .and together they stumble onto the 
biggest conspiracy in the history of Southern 
Califomia. 

The movie was China/own, the conspiracy was a 
collaborative eHort by the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power, large land developers in the 
San Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles Times, and 
a number of powertul Southland politicians . 

Shepard. a former UCSD A ssodated Students 
president and Del Mar mayor, now worlls for 
county Supervisor RORer Hedgecock · A Del Mar 
resident, he is inuolved in /he effort to prellent 
constmclion of North City Wes/, /he first phase of 
which was approved Monday. 

.... Their objective was to convf.:ace the voters of Gs 
Angeles to approve a multimillion dollar bond issue 
in the middle of this country's worst depression: It 
was l10 small task to persuade residents of a small, 
economically depressed city to voluntarily obligate 
themselves to a major public works projec t that , as 
the conspirators were well aware, would be of 
al",ost no benefit to the present residents. 

The public wor~s project was the completion of 
the Colorado River aqueduct distribution system. 
As those of you who saw China/own know, the 
conspirators convinced the residents of · Los 
Arlgeles that the improvements were necessary to 
avoid catastrophic wa ter shortages. They drove 
horne their 'point by secretly creating an artificial 
water shortage before the bond election. 

In the succeeding years , water transported from 
tbe Colorado River would make possible 

Letters to the Editor 

Numbness • lS Nice 

development of the San Fernando Valley and 
Orange and San Diego counties. It would also 
make a small group of developers , bankers and 
newspaper owners very wealthy. 

It c ould be argued that the smog, the urban 
sprawl, the traffic con[,'!stion and the social 
discontinuity which now c haracterize Southern 
California bear a direct causal relationship to the 
water projects of the 30s and 40s. 

However, one thing the water project did notdo 
was relieve the water shortage. As fast as water was 
made available , people moved here to consume it. 

First Owens Valley and the Mono Basin were 
tapped , then the Colorado River, then the Eel and 
Feather Rivers , And still there is not enough water 
to satisfy the rapidly increasing population -'- and 
thirst - of Southern California. 

I recite this rathe r lengthy history because today, 
in San Diego. we are faced with many of the same 
issues Los Angeles confronted over four decades 
ago. 

On June 3, 1963 , the US Supreme Court ruled 
that California wa s stealing I . 1 million a cre feet per 
year of Colorado River Water tha t rightfully 
belonged to the State of Arizona . 

Arizona is now in the final stages of comple ting 
its own huge water distribution project. The Central 
Arizona Project will be finished in 1985 . A tthat time 
Arizonans will begin drinking water curre ntly 
consumed by San Diegans. San Diego will 
experience a substantial reduction in available 
water supplies , which, co mbined with rapid 
population growth, will create a 14% shortfall in 
San Diego's water supplies . 

One solution to this impending crisis is to use 
available water more effic iently. This approach 

Editor: 
I must congratulate W illiam 
Hamilton for his amusing 

'article " Numb your neruons 
for fun and profit" in O ct. 19's 
Daily Guardian. His creative 
use of . the Thesaurus was 
commendable and his "kissing 
a smoker" metaphor was, in a 
word , brillia nt.

introspective. This contempla. 
tion of one 's own conscious· 
ness ( what Hegel might call 
Subjective Freedom) is indeed 
the highes t state of human 

Oinion 

a wareness a nd IS conducive to 
contemplation of Meta physics 
a nd Esthe tics. So there are 
indeed be ne fits to the use of 
drugs. 

P ETER LAURA 

would include conservation (wi-th potential for a 
15% savings) and re-use (re<:lamation of waste 
water for ar.iculturar applications). Howevp.r, this 
solution wa only work if there is no/ a sub.tantial 
increase in population over the next five year •. 

The other solution, advocated by the present-day 
equivalent of Chinatown's conspirators, is to go find 
more untapped rivers, construct more enonnoualy 
expensive transport systems and continue to grow 
as rapidly as possible. 

The San' Diego County Water Authority will 
place a $27 malion bond issue on the June,1980 
ballot to build a fifth pipelil)e into San Diego 

. County. This pipeline, combined with the proposed 
peripheral canal in the Sacramento·San Joaquin 
River delta. would make enough Northern 
California water available for an additional one 
million persons to move to San Diego. 

As in Chinatown, the fifth pipeline would provide 
little benefit to present residents. 1/ con.truction 
were to begin today, the Jl(!ripheral canal would 
take a t least 10 years to complete, thus providing 
no relief during the 1985-90 period when San 
Diego will experience a water shortfall . 

But these major new water projects would benefit 
the de velopers , bankers and others who profit from 
growth which additional water would eventually 
bring. 

The question facing San Diego in the next year is 
whether or not anyone learned anything from Los 
AI!8eles' mistakes. 

The probability is that San Diego will. in our 
lifetimes , become nothing more than a Iookalike 
extension of the L.A megalopolis. Powerful 
economic a nd political interests are doing their best 
to insure this ou\c.:ome.

However, I disagree with 
his thesis. When he sta tes that 
the consumption of drugs is a 
manifestation of "man's self 
destructive proclivities ," he is 
very much mistaken. Since the 
beginning of time milO has 
used alcohoi for the 
celebration of ~fe . It is no small 
coincidence that Dionysus was 
the god of procreation as well 
as wine. The Greek Dionysian 
revels were never complete 
without a few bottles of red . So 
the use of drugs can be seen as 
the manifestation of thf' life 
torce rather than the death 
force: 

Playing Fast and Loose With Jon Bekken 

In a simaar vein, Hamilton 
complains that those who use 
drugs may die earlier than 
those who don 'I. In response to 
this t should remind the author 
that G.W,F. Hegel and Billy 
Joel have written that the 
World Historical Individual 
uBllaUy dies young, often 01 a 
drug overdose. 

Tchaikovsky, when talking 
about his fourth symphony, 
said that much of the work was 
about the weary progress of 
fate , into which he interjected 
a few lighter themes which 
reflec ted the mood of man 
a fter a few glasses of wine. In 
v.ort, T chaikovsky is saying 
that drugs provide a t.ttle 
~omic relief to that long • drawn 
out tragedy which is life. 

Une could say that alter

Pro~Choice Organizers 
Want Abortion Options 

Continued from bafle 1 
As a result of the 1973 Roe 

va. Wade Supreme Court 
decision, abortion is legal 
for "medically acceptable 
reasons" during the first three 
months of pregnancy. The 
Supreme Court's use of non· 
restrictive language in defining 
"medically acceptable" left 
open the option of abortions In 
cases involving the physio· 
logical, mental and emotional 
health of a woman and for 
those cases involving 
congenital problems. 

"Bul. Congress was never 
behind the Supreme Court's 
definition," says Nancy 
Helgeson, a Women's Center 
collective member. "As a 
reltult, Congress ruled in 1976 
that Medicare would fund only 
those abortions needed to 
prevent death of the mother or 
in cases of rape or incest," 
explains Helgeson. 

Supporters of pro·choice 
claim that current legislation is 
a direct infringement on the 
rights of the deprived to an 
abortion.

'Iheological perspectives on

Presbyterian minister Jim Ollis 
of the Religious Coalition on

Ollis will present theological 
perspectives of anti-abortion 
groups as well as those of pro-
choice. 

Among anti-abortion 
groups are those who call 
themselves " pro-lifers ." 
AccQrding to Bacon, pro-
choice supporters are just as 

pro-life as anyone else . "We're

GUTS Wants More 
Plays for Undergrads 

Continued from page 1 
In addition to the 

workshops, GUTS will 
sponsor one-act plays this 
quarter, chosen and directed 
by undergraduates. The one-
acts, says Wolpe, will offer to 
undergraduates the oppor-
tunity to do more acting in 
UCSD drama productions. 

While casting in UCSD 
drama productions has always 
been "open and competitive," 
and graduate students have 
received more parts because 
they are better trained, 
Addison stresses that this year 
the drama department is doing 
three full-length productions, 
and the balance between 

~ndergraduates and graduates 
IS an even one. 

Undergraduate needs have 
nOI "een addressed hitherto 
because the students have 
united themselves like this, 
Wolpe says. Grievances will 

now come from a larger body, 
rather than the previous 
individual "gripes and grunts 
around the drl:lma office." 

The group is a "kind of Big 
Brother, Big Sister thing ," 
Wolp says, providing a sense 
of identity, ' and "hopefully 
preventing the alienation of 
newcomers in the depart-
ment." 

Now numbering 35 
members (approximately one-
third of all undergraduate 
drama majors), GUTS has 
elected Wolpe as its official 
representative, who will have 
direct input into faculty 
meetings. 

GUTS became an official 
AS organization early last 
week. and its first fundinf.( is 
$150 for a Halloween dinner 
theater this Saturday. 

Wolpe hopes eventually to 
have offices and a telephone, 
as well as funding for a play 
she will produce in the Spring.
