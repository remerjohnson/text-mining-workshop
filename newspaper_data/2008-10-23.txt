The University of California 
reached a tentative contract agreement 
with the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees Oct. 
19, closing a 14-month negotiation 
period for 11,000 patient-care technical 

workers who have not received a pay 
increase since 2006.

The five-year agreement — which 
includes $127 million in total salary 
increases and guarantees a systemwide 
PCT minimum wage of $14.50 by 2012 
— will take effect once it is ratified by 
union members early next month.

Since bargaining began in August 
2007, the university has witnessed 
organized walkouts, student demon-
strations and expressions of discontent 
published online by AFSCME. 

UC Office of the President spokes-
man Paul Schwartz said the univer-
sity is relieved to have finally attained a 
compromise.

“We feel that we have had fair and 
financially realistic proposals on the 
table, and we would have liked to have 
reached this point sooner,” he said. 
“But we’re pleased to now be able to 
provide our workers with the raises 
they deserve.”

Under the new contract, PCT 
employees will receive 2-percent 
increases at the beginning of each year, 
as well as midyear raises of 3 to 5 per-
cent. In addition, an across-the-board 
4-percent increase will be paid retro-
actively between the date of ratification 
and Oct. 15, 2007, when the previous 
contract expired. The settlement also 
includes a significant revision to over-

time benefits. The university will dis-
continue a current policy that excludes 
part-time workers by offering overtime 
rates only to those employees who work 
at least 80 hours per pay period. 

Jessica Agost, a senior surgical 
technologist at UCSD Medical Center 
and a member of AFSCME’s patient-
care bargaining team, works only four 
days a week, but she frequently serves 
extended shifts for no reward.

“Somebody like me who works 80 
percent never gets time-and-a-half,” 
she said. “I’m off one day a week, so 
even if I work 12 hours a day side by

In response to increasing concerns 
over financial-aid availability as the eco-
nomic downturn continues, the Bush 
administration released a joint state-
ment from U.S. Secretary of Education 
Margaret Spellings and Secretary of the 
Treasury Henry Paulson last week reas-
suring students that the administration 
will take decisive steps to maintain the 
stability of the student-loan market.

Though officials revealed no spe-
cific plans in achieving this stability, 
the final goal is to restore “the govern-
ment-guaranteed student loan market 
to normal operations,” the statement 
from Spellings and Paulson said.

Additionally, a bill signed last week 
by President George W. Bush extend-
ed the Ensuring Continued Access 
to Student Loans Act, renewing the 
Education Department’s temporary 
powers to apply federal funds to loans 
for students and their families.

“We have no idea what steps the 
administration is planning to take, 
though we are seeking meetings with 
administration officials to see what they 
intend to do,” National Association of 
Student Financial Aid Administrator 
Larry Zaglaniczny said.

Zaglaniczny said it is crucial that the 
government also works toward secur-
ing loans for students continuing their 
studies through this academic year. 

“While it’s great that the adminis-

Despite proclaiming the passage of the impending fee referendum to be necessary for the funding of A.S. Programming and student organizations at their first 
meeting of the new academic year, the A.S. Council’s vote on the referendum has since been delayed for a third time due to bureaucratic complications. 

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

For the third time this quarter, the 
A.S. Council tabled a motion to intro-
duce a new student activity fee refer-
endum yesterday after realizing that 
an addendum recently tacked on to 
the referendum to support the Social 
and Environmental Sustainability 
Committee could not be voted on 
due to the group’s lack of an official 
charter. 

The council tabled the motion 
twice previously in order to discuss 
the referendum with various student 
organizations and individual college 
councils so as to achieve greater sup-
port for the motion before the referen-
dum goes before the student body.

Since the inception of the A.S. 
Council in 1985, the student activity 
fee, which goes directly to the coun-
cil, has remained at $21. Following 
the Promoting Understanding 
and Learning through Service and 
Education fee referendum last year, 
which aimed to fund the Student

The Grove Caffe, an A.S. enterprise, has experienced extensive financial difficulty over the past several 
years. The longtime campus landmark now faces over $100,000 worth of debt.

By Omair Qazi
Contributing Writer

The Grove Caffe — UCSD’s first 
coffee shop, funded by the A.S. 
Council — began the new academic 
year with hopes of financial growth 
but remains mired in debt, strug-
gling to attract customers within 
an increasingly competitive campus 
eatery environment. 

In February of this year, the cafe’s 
debt stood at about $66,000. Since 
then, it has increased to $104,400.

The 2008-09 academic year will 
serve as an evaluation period for 
the Grove following significant 
financial investments from the A.S. 
Council, which funded the salary 
for newly hired manager Cleveland 
Thomas and brought the build-
ing up to code — investments that 

added to the Grove’s accumulating 
debt.

“This year is to see if the Grove 
can survive in a modern UCSD, 
with the new Price Center and 
with competition for where to eat 
on campus,” A.S. Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani said. 

Since the Grove’s struggles last 
year were attributed largely to off-
putting construction surrounding 
its Student Center location, the A.S. 
Council deemed last year’s profit mar-
gins unfit for evaluation. Now that 
construction has dissipated and stu-
dent activity in the area has returned 
to normal, the council will use the 
cafe’s performance through this aca-
demic year to determine whether the

Scientists at UCSD’s Center 
for Interdisciplinary Science in 
Art, Architecture and Archaeology 
(CISA3) are hoping to use advanced 
visualization and analytical technol-
ogies to pinpoint Genghis Khan’s 
secret tomb and conduct a non-
invasive archaeological analysis of 
the area in which he is believed 
to be buried — a region bordered 
by Mongolia’s Onon River and 
the Khan Khentii mountains, near 
Khan’s birthplace in Khentii Aimag.

Legend has it that the ancient 
Mongolian emperor’s men took 
extraordinary pains to ensure that 
the location of his tomb would never 
be discovered. But Dr. Albert Yu-Min 
Lin, an affiliated researcher for the 
CISA3, says that by using unpar-
alleled technology available from 
CISA3 and the California Institute 
for Telecommunications and 
Information Technology, scientists 
may be able to pinpoint  the location 
of Khan’s tomb — and even develop 
a virtual recreation of it using vari-
ous methods of spectral and digital 

imaging.
“Genghis Khan was one of the 

most exceptional men in all of histo-
ry, but his life is too often dismissed 
as being that of a bloodthirsty war-
rior,” Lin said. “Few people in the 
West know about his legacy. But as 
great a man he was, there are few 
clues and no factual evidence about 
Genghis Khan’s burial, which is why 
we need to start using technology to 
solve this mystery.”

Lin and several colleagues 
— including professor Maurizio 
Seracini, the director of CISA3 
and the man behind the search for 
Leonardo da Vinci’s lost “Battle of 
Anghiari” painting — plan to estab-
lish a position at UCSD that will 
allow him to spearhead the three-
year Valley of Khans project, which 
will require $700,000 in funding for 
eight researchers.

“Once we’ve narrowed down 
this region in Mongolia to a certain 
area, we’ll use techniques such as 
ground-penetrating radar, electro-
magnetic induction and magnetom-
etry to produce nondestructive, non-
invasive surveys,” Lin said. “We’ll 
then work with people in UCSD’s 
electrical engineering department to 

develop visual algorithms that will 
allow us to create a high-resolution, 
3-D representation of the site.”

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography researcher and 
UCSD professor of marine chemis-
try Jeffrey Bada and colleagues are 
presenting a new analysis to explain 
the origin of life on Earth, suggesting 
that early volcanic eruptions may 
have provided the essential building 
blocks of life.

The theory, co-authored by Bada 
and Indiana University graduate stu-
dent Adam Johnson, was published 
in a paper titled “The Miller Volcanic 
Spark Experiment” in the Oct. 17 
issue of Science.

The theory adds to the common-
ly accepted primordial-soup experi-
ment published by Stanley Miller in 
1953, under whom Bada studied as 
a UCSD graduate student. Miller’s 
experiment, still used in chemistry 
classes today, simulated earth’s early 
atmosphere by circulating methane, 
ammonia, water vapor and hydro-

gen in a closed environment and 
sending a simulated lightning spark 
through it. After some time, organic 
compounds form, demonstrating 
how Earth’s primitive atmosphere 
may have given rise to life.

“We believed there was more 
to be learned from Miller’s original 
experiment,” said Bada, who had 
preserved Miller’s organic chemi-
cal samples and original lightning 
apparatus to follow up on Miller’s 
studies after his death in 2007. “We 
found that a modern-day version of 
the volcanic apparatus produces a 
wider variety of compounds.”

It is commonly believed that early 
Earth was comprised of many small 
volcanic islands. This study sug-
gests that lightning and the release 
of gases associated with these vol-
canic eruptions could have pro-
duced the necessary chemical com-
ponents to give rise to early life.

“Historically, you don’t get many 
experiments that might be more 
famous than these,” Johnson said. 
“They redefined our thoughts on the 
origin of life and showed unequivo-
cally that the fundamental building 
blocks of life could be derived from 
natural processes.”

Grove will be able to support itself 
financially in the future.

“We’re [searching] for a sign that 
the Grove is not going to dig itself 
deeper,” Lakhani said. “We’re look-
ing at this year, and we’re going to 
determine a plan.” 

The Grove’s mounting debt at 
the end of the 2006-07 academic 
year led to a drastic restructuring of 
its management: Formerly operated 
exclusively by students, the failing 
enterprise hired full-time nonst-
dent Thomas to oversee business 
operations.

In an attempt to differentiate itself 
from other coffee shops on campus 
and attract a larger customer base, 
a number of operational changes 
have been implemented at the Grove. 
Increased advertising and event plan-
ning, as well as the introduction of a 
redesigned menu offering new food 
items, have been part of the effort to 
create a niche in which the Grove can 
thrive. Lakhani cited the Grove’s cater-
ing service as a positive step toward 
the cafe’s financial restoration. 

“It’s been offered since January 
of last year, and it’s slowly increasing 
the amount of money [the Grove] is 
bringing in,” he said. 

In addition to changes in internal 
operations, the A.S. Council remains 

hopeful that positive change for the 
Grove might stem from the actions 
of the Grove Advisory Committee, 
an oversight body formed last year 
that is set to hold its first meeting 
this quarter. The committee will 
confer regularly in order to provide 
a greater degree of scrutiny over 
the Grove’s finances while exist-

ing as a forum to voice manage-
ment concerns. Members include 
Thomas, Lakhani, representatives 
from A.S. Enterprises, the Student 
Life Business Officer and a student 
employee from the Grove. 

Lakhani said the Grove plays 
an important role on campus as 
an alternative to more centralized 

eateries, a function that should take 
precedence over its monetary prof-
its.

“I would just hope for the Grove 
to serve a niche on campus, as the 
place where students can go away 
from the Price Center atmosphere,” 
Lakhani said. “Personally, I don’t 
think it’s important to make thou-
sands and thousands of dollars.”

The Grove was created in part to 
provide students with an opportu-
nity to manage a small business and 
gain experience. Last year, original 
founder and manager of the Grove 
Ron Carlson sold his 50-percent 
stake in the enterprise to Associated 
Students and left the council with a 
debt of $48,000. 

Fiscal debt continued to mount 
throughout the year, prompting the 
A.S. Council to consider closing 
the eatery. Alternative options such 
as renting the space to a new ven-
dor, hiring a full-time manager or 
partnering with the Rady School of 
Management were discussed, but the 
council settled on hiring Thomas to 
provide a stable influence in the day-
to-day operations of the enterprise. 

Grove management declined to 
comment.

New Year to Serve as Evaluation Period for Ailing Cafe
▶ GROVE, from page 1

Last night, the A.S. Council was graced with the presence of Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue, who opened the 
meeting with a special presentation 
and welcomed questions from coun-
cilmembers. She came before the 
council to discuss the concerns of 
the Student Affairs office and to ask 
for the council’s help in planning for 
UCSD’s 50th anniversary.

Rue was greeted with a plethora 
of questions from councilmembers 
regarding everything from the Loft 
to the RIMAC 
Annex to the free-
speech policy.

“One of the 
benefits and det-
riments to being 
part of a 10-cam-
pus system is that 
problems of other campuses get pro-
mulgated to all campuses,” Rue said of 
the recently implemented systemwide 
free-speech policy. “That solution 
given was for a problem that didn’t 
exist on this campus.”

Revelle College Chair James 
Lintern asked Rue about what she 
perceived as the biggest improvement 
in unifying the campus community 
since her arrival.

“I’m a huge fan of the Triton stat-
ue,” Rue said. “It’s a small thing, but it’s 
visual. A lot of building community 
has to do with symbols.”

In addition, when grilled about her 
stance on the impending fee referen-
dum, she declared her support for the 
idea, though she felt that the language 
was too binding for future leaders to 
work with.

During oral reports Associate Vice 
President of External Affairs Lisa 
Chen announced the final results of 
the CalPIRG and Associated Students 
voter registration drive. The numbers 
were greeted with a drum-roll and 

applause.
“The final number is 3,936 new 

registered voters,” Chen said. “All the 
UCs together have 40,000 new regis-
tered voters, and we are fourth in the 
nation for registered voters.”

After Rue’s departure, Associate 
Vice President of Programming 
Garrett Berg requested that the coun-
cil allow a special presentation regard-
ing the perilous financial situation 
of this year’s Sun God Festival. He 
proposed to move $80,000 from A.S.-
mandated reserves to fill the gaping 

black hole of funds 
for the festival.

“Even if the 
referendum pass-
es, we do not have 
enough money 
for Sun God this 
year,” Berg said.

Discussion of the council’s tired, 
unfinished business of the referendum 
trailed the two presentations. The issue 
of the Loft, its need for programming 
funds and whether it should be includ-
ed in the proposed activity fee referen-
dum sparked substantial debate. 

“If [the University Events Office] 
needs the money, they can make their 
own referendum,” Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy Frank 
Carroll said. “Does the Loft need the 
money? Apparently not because Penny 
Rue came in and said it will survive; 
student orgs may not.”

The discussion was truncated by 
the council’s discovery that the Social 
and Environmental Sustainability 
Committee’s proposed referendum 
addendum could not be voted on 
because no charter was ever conceived 
for the organization. 

Since the proposal has been 
requested to be tacked onto the 
A.S. referendum, neither one could 
be voted on and were begrudgingly 
tabled for yet another week.

tration is looking to ensure that loans 
will be available for the next academic 
school year, we will be working to 
make sure they are also taking steps to 
make sure that loans will still be there 
for the students who need them for 
next semester of this year,” Zaglaniczny 
said.

Though the student loan market is 
facing difficulties because of tight credit 
markets and an uncertain economic 
forecast, Zaglaniczny is confident that 
federal loans for students will still be 
available next year. 

“While I have no question that any 
administration will ensure that federal 
loans are available, an administration 
can take measures that affect the stu-
dent loan market that are more or less 
effective,” he said. “We, of course, are 
hoping for the former.”

Under the Bush administration’s 
$700-billion bailout plan, Paulson 
has standing powers to prop up both 
the federal loan market and the more 
restrictive private student loan market 
with federal funds. 

“The secretary of the treasury has a 
blank check, in terms of his authority, 
to intervene in the student loan mar-
kets — both federal and nonfederal,” 
Zaglaniczny said.

While no further explanation has 
clarified the ways through which the 
administration hopes to secure the 
student loan market, the statement 
describes the initiative as expedited 
and aggressive, and says that more 
announcements will be forthcoming 
over the next several weeks.

and Service, the activity fee rose to 
$28 per student per quarter, but the 
amount of money the council receives 
to fund campuswide events such as the 
Sun God Festival remained the same. 

The current referendum was pro-
posed in reaction to the council’s recent 
realization that the funding it now 
receives from student fees is barely 
enough to sustain current A.S. activi-
ties, much less allow for the improve-
ment of any provided services.

“The A.S. Council has been func-
tioning on the same $21 per stu-
dent per quarter since the council 
was founded,” A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Athletic Relations Peter 
Benesch said. “We are either going to 
fail to meet the needs of students, or 
we will need to increase the amount 
of money the A.S. Council is receiving 
from student fees.”

Currently, A.S. Programming has 
$200,000 allotted for Sun God. This 
amount represents less than half the 
funds spent organizing last year’s 
festival. Even with the provision of 
additional funds if the referendum 
passes, A.S. Programming will still be 
$80,000 short of the amount needed 
to maintain the festival’s previous 
scope.

“Even if A.S. Programming were to 
cut every single event we put on other 
than Sun God, the festival would still 

be much smaller than previous years’ 
without the funding from the refer-
endum,” Festivals Coordinator Alex 
Bramwell said. 

If the council passes the fee ref-
erendum, the largest chunk of the 
newly raised activity fee would go 
to A.S. Programming. A.S. Student 
Organization Funding, the group that 
doles out funds to the ever-increasing 
number of campus student organi-
zations, would receive a lesser but 
still substantial $4 per student per 
quarter. 

Other areas that would receive funds 
from the proposed fee referendum 
include the A.S. External Affairs Office, 
the University of California Student 
Association Dues, A.S. Safe Ride, the 
All-Campus Transfer Association and 
All-Campus Commuter Board, A.S. 
Women’s Commission and Alliance, 
KSDT Radio, Student-Run Television 
and A.S.-mandate reserves.

A full 29 percent of the fee refer-
endum is allotted for a mandatory 
“return-to-aid” that will become part 
of the university’s financial-aid fund. 

If the council, and subsequently 
the student body, approves the ref-
erendum, the proposed fee increase 
would go into effect Spring Quarter

side with nurses, [overtime] does not 
go into effect.”

The new overtime plan — identi-
cal to those at competing San Diego 
hospitals Scripps Memorial and Kaiser 
Permanente — grants employees 150-
percent pay after eight hours and dou-
ble-time after 12 hours, without the 
80-hour pay period requirement.

AFSCME Local 3299 President 
Lakesha Harrison added that for the 
first time ever, union approval will be 
required for any revisions to health-
care or pension policies that the univer-
sity wishes to implement.

“In the past, the university was just 
able to say, ‘Here are your new rates for 
health care,’” she said. “Now the work-
ers have the final say.”

Agost said PCT contracts have 
always lasted only three years, and that 
the union’s most recent demands were 
more ambitious than usual. However, 
she said workers have been struggling 
for a long time, and that her bargain-
ing team remained patient in order to 
avoid committing to a contract that was 
“just OK.”

“I would say that this is the best con-
tract PCT workers have ever received,” 
she said. “It might not be exactly where 
we want to be, but we had a lot on the 
table and we got a lot.”

Harrison called the contract a vic-
tory, but emphasized that roughly 8,500 
service workers — also represented by 
AFSCME — remain in poverty and 
have been working without a contract 
since January. 

“This agreement reflects the kind 
of change we’re trying to make, but this 
is only half the battle,” she said. “We 
represent 20,000 workers, and this still 
leaves our service workers out. Many 
of these workers are eligible for public 
assistance, and they are the workers we 
really need to help now.”

Whereas patient-care technical sal-
aries are funded by UC medical center 
revenues, the university relies on state 
money for its service workers. 

Schwartz explained that although 
many service employees work at the 
medical centers, the university must 
consider all service workers in the same 
category for equity purposes.

“The amount of money we get from 
the state is the biggest single source 
for systemwide increases, and we have 
to think about employees across the 
system,” he said. “All of our employees 
deserve to be compensated fairly, and 
we’re working hard toward that goal to 
the extent that resources allow.”

A.S. councilmembers recently came to the harsh realization that certain aspects of their 
enterprise have gone utterly broke. 
Currently possessing barely half the 
funds needed to stage the annual Sun 
God Festival, A.S. Programming has 
hit a financial dead end, while the 
council’s funding for student organiza-
tions is quickly dwindling to a trickle. 

In order to tackle this rapidly wors-
ening financial conundrum, council-
members earlier this year proposed 
bringing a new activity fee referen-
dum before the student body, the first 
since the council’s inception in 1985. 
Aimed primarily at resuscitating the 
ailing A.S. Programming, the envi-
sioned referendum would, in its cur-
rent form, raise student fees by an addi-
tional $19.82 per student per quarter, 
leaving A.S. Associate Vice President 
of Programming Garret Berg and his 
posse of programmers with the finan-
cial freedom and peace of mind to 
organize an even worse festival lineup 
than last year’s.

With additional funds allotted to 
various campus organizations and 
enterprises, including KSDT Radio 
and A.S. Safe Ride, the referendum 
seems poised to rescue the flounder-
ing council from tapping into their 
much-coveted reserves. Having to do 
so, councilmembers contend, is not an 
option. Thus it would appear that this 
referendum is crucial to the continued 
survival of the many A.S.-funded ser-
vices this campus has come to shelter. It 
would be a vast relief, a saving grace an 
unprecedented emergency bailout, one 
might say, of epic proportions.

Yet after all this, they still can’t seem 
to finalize the damn thing. 

Last night, the council decided once 
again to postpone a vote on whether to 
bring the new referendum before the 
student body. This marks the third time 
councilmembers have tabled this vote, 
indicating that our student government 
is perhaps even less organized than 
originally given credit for.

The council’s decision to again 
stall this vote, however, reveals a much 
deeper flaw within this governing body 
than one of mere disorganization or an 
inability to maintain campaign prom-
ises. The council is meant to exist as an 
institution that represents and ensures 
the continued well-being of student 
interests, yet the apparent inability of 
councilmembers to carry out their 
duties in a timely manner suggests an 
alarming lack of foresight, the inability 
to execute a well-laid plan and perhaps 
just plain apathy. 

Councilmembers attribute their lat-
est failure to approve the referendum to 
the fact that an organization added into 
the proposal at the last minute has not 
yet drafted a charter, a requirement for 
any enterprise funded by the council. 
Why, however, when dealing with such 
an important matter, should something 
so obvious slip under the radar? 

This is more than just a mistake; it’s 
a stark testament to the sort of lacka-
daisical attitude possessed by so many 
councilmembers. This is an incident 
that points to a lack of oversight within 
the council, to a disregard for respon-
sibility and to a distinct absence of any 
noticeable coherence among those sup-
posedly representing the student body. 

Hopefully councilmembers will get 
their act together long enough to actu-
ally put this issue to a student vote at 
some point in the near future, especial-

ly considering the last time the council 
sponsored a special election (SRTV, 
anyone?), it took nearly two months to 
organize. It would be unacceptable if 
the funds needed to maintain crucial 
campus events and organizations — 
Sun God in particular — were simply 
not attained in time.

EDITORIAL BOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San Diego. Views expressed 
herein represent the majority vote of the editorial board 

and are not necessarily those of the UC Board of 
Regents, ASUCSD or members of the Guardian staff. 

Earlier this week, as the autumnal fog of Southern California season change 
rolled hazily over campus, the newly 
remodeled Price Center machine 
chugged smoothly along and stu-
dents cemented their Fall Quarter 
routines and began studying for 
midterms, the few humanities-
minded Tritons in our midst were 
reminded, yet again, that even after 
that epic tassel turn there will be no 
jobs for us. 

The recent career fair on Library 
Walk — one of the many hosted at 
UCSD each year — surely provided 
relief to science-major seniors con-
cerned over facing a harsh economy 
upon graduation, as the pathway 
was full of friendly job scouts sitting 
invitingly at neat white booths. There 
was, and consistently has been, very 
little attention given to the hundreds 
of Tritons who aren’t interested in 
those fields (and apparently made a 
horrible mistake somewhere along 
the line when choosing which col-
lege to attend). 

Now over the past two years 
I’ve stood witness to countless rants 
from my column-writing peers 
about how the arts and humani-
ties — and given our own personal 
standing, literature majors specifi-
cally — are basically the red-headed 
stepchildren of San Diego’s hottest 
school for science. And though it’s 
totally true, I’ve made a conscious 
decision not to go there. There’s 
nothing to be accomplished by sit-
ting in a writerly bubble, writing 
complaints about how no one is 
supporting our writerly bubble. 
What I am going to do now is pro-
claim how baller each and every 
humanities major is.

So to all the kids who took that 
other chemistry series freshman year 
— you know, the one that starts with 
a course simply titled “The Periodic 
Table” — this one’s for you. Why? 
Because you’re bold. You recklessly 
laughed in the face of 20-plus years 
of parental pressure, sadist lectures 
from at least one desperate teacher 
a quarter, a global market system 
driven by technological advances 
and probably your own better judg-
ment to pursue something greater 
than future financial stability. 

You, my friends, are the true 
pioneers of tomorrow, courageously 
committing your time and ener-
gy to subjects that actually spark 
your interest. You aren’t afraid to 
admit that solving organic chemis-
try mechanisms for hours is shitty 
and, ultimately, pretty pointless. 
And for that you deserve accolades 
even greater than those UCSD has 
obtained. 

The squeaky wheel gets the 
grease, and in a university over-
flowing with frantic begoggled pre-
meds, it’s only fitting that these kids 
would receive the most career sup-
port, program funding and course 
variety. Sure, all that we humanities 
majors have to hold onto is the

Dear Editor,
It was your average, sunny San 

Diego afternoon and I was hastily 
cruising down La Jolla Village Drive 
trying to get to school on time. As I 
approached the Genesee Avenue/La 
Jolla Village Drive intersection, some-
thing happened that has probably hap-
pened to all of us. As I was getting 
closer to the lights the green suddenly 
turned yellow. I was already past of the 
point of no return, as in “slow down 
boy,” so I had two options: either I was 
going to blast through the yellow and 
hopefully pass the intersection before 
the light turned red, or make a very, 
very painful stop and wait for the light 
to turn green again while enjoying the 
aroma of burnt rubber. What did I do? 
Well, that’s not the point of this letter.

Having encountered this dilem-
ma many times, I have now gener-
ated a phobia of approaching green 
lights from a distance. I always ques-
tion myself, “Has it been green for 
awhile?” or “Has it just turned green?” 
Simultaneously, I get ready to put on 
some Formula 1 moves. Yes, Formula 
1, that’s what we Europeans watch (not 
that there are many maneuvers). To be 
honest, it’s not pleasant. I have thought 
of some solutions but nothing has 
been as pleasant as what I witnessed 
this past year while I was visiting 
my home country, Turkey. The traffic 
lights there (yes, we have cars!) have 
an interesting twist to them. As the 
green light approaches its end it starts 
blinking, notifying the driver by basi-
cally saying, “Heads up, I am about to 
turn yellow.” If this were implemented 
in California, drivers who were 100 
feet away from a green light that’s 
blinking would start slowing down 

instead of keeping a constant speed 
and then having to decide what to 
do as soon as the light turns yellow 
50 feet from the intersection. Think 
about it — how many people are there 
that get into accidents just because 
they thought they could pass it? OK, 
I am not saying what they did is right 
but I honestly believe that if you do 
not put that driver in that worrisome 
position in the first place, maybe he 
or she would make a more conscious 
decision.

What would this change require? I 
don’t know, maybe a reprogramming 
of the software? We know that the 
lights are capable of blinking, espe-
cially for the people who drive late at 
night. Is it too much to ask?

Dear Editor,
Summer is barely over and already 

there is talk of flu season. Student 
Health Service has its supply of flu 
shots available and is encouraging stu-
dents to come in for their flu shot. You 
might be thinking: “But hey, I knew 
someone who said they actually got 
the flu from the flu shot. So why take 
the chance?”

Why? Well, every year in the 
United States, 5 to 20 percent of the 
population gets the flu. Here at UCSD 
that could be close to 5,000 students, 
not to mention about 3,000 faculty 
and staff. That’s a lot of flu virus float-
ing around — literally, floating! Flu 
viruses spread mainly from person to 
person through coughing or sneezing. 
Think of being in a large lecture hall, 
or maybe a movie theater; ever hear 
anyone coughing or sneezing?

Another way people may become 

infected is by touching something 
with flu viruses on it and then touch-
ing their mouth, nose or eyes.  How 
many door handles, chairs and desk-
tops do you touch in a day?

Most healthy adults may be able to 
infect others beginning one day before 
symptoms develop and up to five days 
after becoming sick. That means you 
may be able to pass on the flu to 
someone else before you know you 
are sick. So, that poor guy in Center 
Hall coughing his head off didn’t really 
mean to get you sick.  

Since there is only so much you 
can do to prevent getting the flu, you 
should get a flu shot. It is still the best 
protection against the flu. The thought 
of a fever, body aches and feeling 
exhausted should have you heading 
over to Student Health for your flu 
shot today!

Flu shots and FluMist (nasal 
spray) are available on a walk-in basis, 
Monday through Friday. Students 
with chronic health conditions such as 
asthma, kidney disease, diabetes, heart 
disease, lung disease, chronic bronchi-
tis or a weakened immune system pay 
only $2 for their flu shot. For all other 
students the cost is $16 for the shot, or 
$25 for the nasal spray.

Stealing
the Shoes

By Gabriella Capisani
Contributing Writer 

ON CAMPUS — Fraternities and 
sororities are most commonly known 
for weekend ragers and the occa-
sional contribution to the commu-
nity through required philanthropy. 
As UCSD is not exactly famous for 
its social scene, oftentimes the most 
prominent advertisements on Library 
Walk are for Greek life. For incom-
ing freshmen looking to squeeze as 
much as they can from their college 
experience, going Greek is presented 
as the perfect, all-inclusive package. 
Differing from the drunken stereo-
type, UCSD Greeks boast a great bal-
ance between rigorous academics and 
a healthy social life. And while the 
Greek system may be a good outlet 
and source of fun on campus, the 
entry process — Rush Week — is bla-
tantly shallow.

The six-day Panhellenic recruit-
ment process requires pledges to nar-
row their sorority preferences further 
and further each night, picking their 
top two from the original nine by the 
end of the week. When a rushee has 
ranked her choices, she is matched 
against the chapters’ rankings to find 
the most mutual selections, a process 
that allegedly ensures that incoming 
members will receive a bid from one

Juicy Campus a Cesspool 
of  Pathetic Hate Speech

By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

STUDENT LIFE — Covering 500 
university campuses nationwide and 
boasting nearly 100,000 musings 
since its August 2007 launch, gos-
sip Web site JuicyCampus.com has 
quickly become a fast and easy way 
for students to read and post entries 
on their campus’ respective page 
about any topic they choose. In fact, 
the site’s motto pretty much sums 
up its purpose: “C’mon. Give us the 
juice.” 

The site, however, comes with 
a catch: anonymity. Promising 
all entries will be posted without 
requiring registration or otherwise 
giving away the submitter’s identi-
ty, Juicy Campus is almost like a 
college version of celebrity-gossip 
Web site PerezHilton.com — except 
that entries about Britney, Miley or 
Brangelina have been replaced with 
posts about your roommate, your 
resident adviser or in some cases 
maybe even you. 

Juicy Campus allows users to 
search the list of postings by key 
words (ahem, names) or browse the 
most viewed, most voted, most agreed 
or most discussed entries. More often 
than not, the site’s entries are peer-
related, involving anecdotes that ridi-
cule, judge or — rarely — praise other 
students. Usually these comments are 
acidic, discussing such topics as “the 
biggest man-whore on campus,” “the 
sluttiest sorority girl” and “guess who 
has herpes.” Usually they are posted 
by members of the Greek community. 
And usually they receive hundreds 
of views, replies and counter-replies, 
in essence transforming the site into 
a huge, virtual bathroom wall that 

allows anyone with Internet access a 
chance to contribute.

Because of the negativity sur-
rounding many of the posts, it’s unsur-
prising the site has become quite con-
troversial on several university cam-
puses — at Pepperdine University, 
the student government passed a 
resolution earlier this year urging the 
administration to block access to the 
site, and similar measures have been 
discussed at Columbia University and 
Yale University. Bloggers across the 
Internet have denounced the site as 
a breeding ground for hate speech, 
personal attacks and blatant lies, with 
one student from George Washington 
University describing the site as an 
offshoot of the “Mean Girls” movie 
script.

The student, Max McGowen — 
who himself has been a target on 
the site — has played a leading role 
at George Washington University as  
part of a grass-roots effort to bring 
Juicy Campus down from within by 
swamping the site daily with long-
winded entries discussing topics as 
diverse as the intricacies of Latin to 
the history of the Egyptian pyramids. 
Students at other universities, includ-
ing Cornell University and Williams 
College, have also resorted to this 
technique, posting chunks from the 
Bible or in some cases entire novels to 
drown out any potentially offensive 
entries.

But even as complaints about the 
site’s content continue to rise, Juicy 
Campus remains popular and its 
founder, Duke University alumnus 
Matt Ivester, has said the site has 
plans to expand even more, defend-
ing it as an arena for free speech and a

of their top sororities while simul-
taneously achieving the best fit for 
everyone.

Walking into a room filled with 
smiling girls, all dancing and chanting 
their individual chapter songs, was 
like walking into Disneyland’s “It’s 
a Small World” ride. Each sorority 
chooses how to present itself to the 
group of pledges through compel-
ling speeches from chapter presidents 
about their “classy reputation” or 
“focus on philanthropy” and picture 
slide shows. The girls all appear to be 
interested and lively but once the song 
and dance was finished and pledg-
es were partnered randomly with a 
member for a brief interview, routine 
took over.

Each veteran stood scanning her 
rushee, asking the girl’s name, college 
and major, with all the excitement and 
interest of a well-rehearsed infomer-
cial, internally gauging whether the 
answers matched the mold. 

After just a few short minutes the 
conversations ended as members flut-
tered off to meet new girls — leaving 
with one last thorough up-and-down 
glance. The distinct blueprint in each 
chapter’s room was uncanny, as the 
high-heeled, short-skirted blondes 
were at home with the Pi Phis and 
the quieter (often Jewish) girls were 
warmly welcomed by AEPhi.

Although pledges are made to 
believe that the chapters are trying 
to impress each and every one of 
them, it’s impossible to deny the truth 
about their reputations. Pledges are 
encouraged to leave preconceptions 
at the door; however, walking into 
each chapter’s room just confirms 
the so-called rumors. Each sorority’s 
pictures, memorabilia and members 
themselves were living proof of the 
stereotypes pledges were told to for-
get.

Being herded like cattle from room 
to room in dictatorial silence was a 
sharp contrast to the bubbly parties 
championed by sorority members. 
Pledges were not allowed to speak 
to each other — a strictly enforced 
measure to discourage chatty girls 
from passing on information of these 
“false” caricatures and influencing 

other people’s opinions. This demand 
was obviously useless, as pledges are 
well aware of which sororities are con-
sidered the best — meaning the most-
favored by frats — and silly, since 
chapters are simultaneously looking 
to fill their mini-me quota.

Entering the dark, pushy lair of the 
less-praised sororities, pledges were 
surrounded by the sad desperation of 
chapters trying to prove their worthi-
ness. Be it their looming height or 
awkward sweat stains, there was a 
clear difference between these Greeks 
and those from the more coveted 
chapters. They sang and danced like 
the neighboring sororities, but these 
girls were less successful in attract-
ing an excited group of followers, 
nearly begging each rushee to give 
their chapter a shot through awkward 
strokes of the arm and intent, uncom-
fortable stares. 

But despite the claims of a happy 
mutual selection, at the end of the 
sometimes-grueling process, the deci-
sions and preconceptions of each 
chapter carry a much heavier weight 
than the desire of the pledge. No one’s 
nuanced personality can be expressed 
in a three-minute meet-and-greet, so 
there’s no way sorority selections are 
based on anything other than an aes-
thetic evaluation. And with quarterly 
dues in the range of $300, rushees bet-
ter hope they wore the right shoes to 
impress their soon-to-be sisters.

While on bid day throngs of 
screaming pledges rush excitedly 
toward the top-choice sorority that 
selected them, there are still tons of 
forgotten girls who paid $30 only to 
find there was no perfect, mutual 
match for them. It was these girls who 
marched tearfully home from Price 
Center, clutching their high heels, 
lamenting their devastation over not 
being chosen by the chapters they felt 
a connection with. Although this oth-
erwise-celebrated Greek system may 
provide a sustainable social life for the 
“in” crowd, the allegedly mutual rush 
process proves to be just as shallow 
as Elle Woods in all her stereotypical 
glory.

convenient central point for students 
to exchange ideas that would have 
supposedly been discussed on cam-
pus anyway. And although speech 
that is “unlawful, threatening, abu-
sive, tortious, defamatory, obscene, 
libelous or invasive of another’s priva-
cy” is prohibited by the site’s terms of 
use and Ivester declared on his site’s 
official blog that “hate isn’t juicy,” 
the fact remains that users of the site 
don’t really care 
and students con-
tinue to be listed 
by name along 
with links to por-
nographic films 
in which they’ve 
acted, people 
they’ve slept with 
and drugs they’ve 
taken, posted 
alongside lists 
of who’s hot and 
who’s not.

So the tug-of-
war continues between Juicy Campus 
administrators and students deter-
mined to overload the site with ran-
dom entries in an effort to mask 
personal attacks, while postings con-
tinue to accumulate, even on UCSD’s 
own page, which is peppered with its 
fair share of embarrassingly crude 
comments.

While in a perfect world every-
one would be nice to each other and 
would never resort to anonymously 
posting random personal informa-
tion on a gossip Web site, in reality 

that is never going to happen, unless 
the law under which the site takes 
haven — the federal Communications 
Decency Act of 1996, which provides 
immunity to Web sites to prevent 
them from being held accountable 
for information posted by users — is 
altered by Congress. And that creates 
a whole host of legal issues (the law 
was designed to prevent major com-
panies like AOL from legal implica-
tions from comments made in chat 

rooms, for exam-
ple) that make it 
unlikely the law 
will change any-
time soon.

Until then, 
posters will post, 
students will 
retaliate and Juicy 
Campus admin-
istrators will get 
richer. It’s a never-
ending merry-go-
round.

So the moral 
of the story is if you don’t like the 
site, don’t use it. If you want to be 
an undignified, slimy asshole, post 
entries about other people that would 
make you cringe if they were about 
you. Or if you want to truly use the 
site as a forum for student communi-
cation, ditch the hate speech and post 
commentary that is actually relevant 
to making your campus a better place 
for everyone.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

Kitchell
SONYA

by Simone Wilson
E

veryone loves a child prodigy — and if any-
one knows everyone, it’s Starbucks. When the 
corporate giant to clobber all corporate giants 
plucked singer-songwriter Sonya Kitchell, a 

homely 16-year-old with one ambitious EP to her 
name, from the banks of a Massachussetts brook-
town in 2006, the caffeine monopoly and their legions 
of back-pocket critics knew just how to pitch her.

Angelic. Jazzy. Virtuosic. Wise far beyond her 
years. Lightly sprinkled with every last press-release 
keyword in their people-pleasing bank, Words Came 
Back to Me (Kitchell’s first full-length) soon drew the 
jittery J. Crew crowd from every urban and suburban 
street corner, looking for that buzzed-about up-and-
comer to peruse over their double soy latte — all sips 
and chin-strokes and bedroom eyes to the equally 
jazzy lunch-breaker across the lounge. The simplistic 
puppy-love musings of such an unsharpened mind 
melted effortlessly over schmoozy piano into the daily 
routines of a million busy Americans with no need for 
more weights to the brain, grateful for straightforward 
drags like “Why I love you, I cannot say/ Honey, rea-
sons are reasons/ Emotions are so funny that way.” But 
despite the company’s cheesily grandiose propor-
tions, Kitchell insists she never felt pressured to 
cram herself into anybody’s cookie cutter.

“It’s a large small company,” she said in an 
interview on Wednesday. “Plus, they helped me get 
my work out there; it was an ideal situation.”

In the long run, though, it could be a disservice, 
being plastered all over everyone’s consumer dreams 
like that. The public adoration inevitably heaped 
onto such a highly publicized talent her age — and 
granted, the country girl did know her way around 
a Mitchell tune and an acoustic guitar, but E. E. 
Cummings comparisons? Really? — may be good and 

cuddly for a time, but no artist can truly recover from 
a corporate magnifying glass held so intently to her 
awkward stage. A Scarlett Johansson-type teenhood 
of too many Billie Holiday records, layers of dress-up 
gauze and tales of the good old boys bathed her in 
jazz traditions of someone else’s present, leaving the 
idealized darling smelling of their timeless influence 
but without much of a tradition of her own. And who 
could really deny an imitator so pretty in her devo-
tion, so committed and sincere? Outside the coffee 
chain, Kitchell lured just the right critical attention: 
National Public Radio’s soft and cradling All Things 
Considered drew a whole new kind of fan to her 
cause, complete with their bumper-stickered Volvos 
and travel mugs with definitely-not-Starbucks inside.

Things got even better when the ever-prolific 
Herbie Hancock, accessible millennium leftover of 
Miles Davis’ second great quintet, hand-picked the 
youngster for a Joni Mitchell tribute tour. And it’s 
really no wonder: Kitchell’s full-bodied, husky-then-
shrill vocal vacillations are eerily similar to the origi-
nal acoustic poet to whom she so looks up (and with 
whom, ironically, she shares the Starbucks rack — 
they paved paradise, indeed). Kitchell describes the 

experience of singing “All I Want” as not so far a 

People Under the Stairs
■ Fun DMC
GOLD DUST MEDIA

F un. It’s devastating, it’s hard hitting, its mind blowing. What can I say? It kicks ass.”
Fun DMC is two B-boys’ return to 

those Los Angeles-afternoon barbeques 
in the dead of summer — an endear-
ing tribute by underground producer-
emcees Thes One and Double K to 
the days when hip-hop was not just 
an expression of daily struggles, but an 
outlet to release inner-city stress — in 
short, to have some fun. 

People Under the Stairs effectively 
pay their dues to the old school, both 
in lyrical craft and affectionate, crate-
digging production. Thes One emulates 
legend Jam-Master-Jay’s percussion lay-
out, lacing the classic blueprint with 
manic snare and hi-hat loops accom-
panied by well-rationed bass drums. 
Opening track “The Swan Fever” sets 
up the backyard party, as attendees hol-
ler over an infectious, energized trum-
pet crescendo; the bash only gets louder 
with “Up Yo Spine,” a live recording 
given a block-party feel by the clapping 
of the crowd.

Thes One’s copious throwbacks add 
undeniable charm to his production. 

“The Ultimate 144” is a seamless com-
position of celebrated beats from gurus 
like Eric B., Jam-Master-Jay and DJ Kay 
Jee, sure to tickle those nostalgic nerves 
among every degree of hip-hop head. 
A sample of Tupac’s “California Love” 
is spun with a faint conga loop beneath 
a rapid-clap beat for a respectable nod 
to Dr. Dre.

Although the majority of Fun DMC 
flows in this finesse, it’s not free of 
irregularities. The mushy reggae-rap of 
“People Riddum” is blessed with catchy 
vocals, yet is discordantly uncharac-
teristic of PUTS’ brass-and-drum pro-
duction style; and though reminiscent 
ballad “D” pays musically sound respect 
to lost loved ones, its dreary ambience is 
unbefitting of such an upbeat record.

Fun DMC’s shine is in the polish: 
Whether with a clever Pharcyde sound 
bite or between-track party conversa-
tion, the close attention to detail makes 
this tribute a reflective success in its own 
right. Summer might be over, but there’s 
no reason we can’t keep celebrating.

SEX AND SATIRE STIR THE OLD SOUTH

By Leila Haghighat
Contributing Writer

T he collision of overt sexu-ality and immodest religi-osity erupts into an only 
modestly cliche reflection of 
family structure in “Tobacco 
Road,” the stage adaptation of 
Erskine Caldwell’s 1932 novel. Despite cut-chewing 
hillbillies whispering God-fearing prayers, the play 
steers far from a trite allegory of Bible Belt South. 

Wrapping up its third week at the La Jolla Playhouse, 
“Tobacco Road” teeters between the extremities of 
lewdness and misery in chronicling the Lester family 
breakdown. With a quick pace that defies its charac-
ters’ slurred Southern accents, the play plunges into 
the Lesters’ economic turmoil as failed sharecroppers, 
only to emerge heroically in the end with a sliver of 
hope as arid as the untilled land. 

Jeeter Lester (John Fleck), 
the family’s obstinate patri-
arch, refuses to abandon 
sharecropping in spite of the 
bank’s imminent repossession 
of his house. Anchored by tra-
dition, he affirms that “people 
who’s born on the land should 
stay on the land,” much to 

the chagrin of his unrelenting wife Ada (Jan Leslie 
Harding) and her aspiration to indulge in the shop-
ping districts of a far-away Augusta.  

On the fringes of the stage linger hare-lipped 
daughter Ellie May (Kate Dalton) and Grandma 
(Lucy Ann Albert), whose inarticulacy throughout 
the play reflects the unimportance her family shame-
lessly attributes to her. Jeeter doggedly professes his 
indifference to the possibility of Grandmother’s death

“Happy-Go-Lucky”
HILLCREST LANDMARK / OCT. 24 / 7 P.M. / $10.50

Downing uppers would seem the only way Mike Leigh 
could pull out an uncharacteristically optimistic portrait of 
a London schoolteacher with a Hannah Montana attitude 
— and from the same hat that hung on characters 
like the nihilistic Johnny in “Naked.” But he does, and 
“Happy-Go-Lucky” isn’t a sugar-coated pill too sweet to 
swallow, either. 

Poppy (Sally Hawkins), a leading lady already 
collecting critical praise, keeps a smile despite the 
Job-esque tribulations that affront her personal life. As 
pensive a film as any of Leigh’s, the perfect midterm 
pickup this week won’t be the Adderall in your roommate’s 
desk. (EG)

Neil Young & Death Cab for Cutie

COX ARENA / OCT. 29 / 7 P.M. / $54

Neil Young is either getting too old to make rational 
decisions or desperately wants to be relevant, because the idea 
of Death Cab opening for the vetted folk-rocker is surreal in the 
worst way. Most of Cutie’s fan base probably isn’t familiar with 
Young’s rough acoustics and calloused lyrics, so far removed 
from Ben Gibbard’s shiny vulnerability. Still, the fact that two 
such gigantic acts are sharing the same bill might make a few 
people ecstatic   — all those that love themselves some open-
faced emotion with a side of grizzly balladry. (CK)

By Edwin Gonzalez
Associate Hiatus Editor

D irty cops are common folk in Batman comics, pulp-fiction paperbacks and every Joe Carnahan (“Smokin’ Aces,” “Narc”) script ever penned. With 
an eHarmony profile that undoubtedly lists his inter-
ests as firearms, witty zingers, “fuck” as a noun/adjec-
tive/verb and copious amounts of red dye waiting to be 
sprayed across windows as his “Interests,” Carnahan’s 
one-trick-pony salesmanship catches the eye of Director 
Gavin O’Connor in his latest  homage to New York’s 
Finest.

A film plagued by innumerable studio setbacks 
since its insemination back in 2001, “Pride and Glory” 
finally arrives — fashionably late — with a lacklus-
ter mainstream makeover. Conceived as an arthouse 
under the title “Manhattan North,” producers pan-
icked, underestimating the blockbuster stronghold of 
“High School Musical 3” and plethora of Halloween 
commodities.  

Despite the fact that its final title sounds like a Nazi 
propaganda picture, “Glory” crawls the narcotics bazaar 
of New York’s inner-city, host to Rodney King re-enact-
ments and very few law-abiding men. However, guaran-
teed and gently pushed into police work by their father’s 
saintly legacy, Franny (Noah Emmerich), Ray (Edward 
Norton) and Jimmy (Colin Farrell) honor the Tierney 
family name with their dedicated service to the state 
and loyalty to the values that begin in the home.

 With Francis Sr. (Jon Voight) as the clan’s sage patri-

arch and city’s former Police Chief, the NYPD Tierney 
coat-of-arms becomes an aegis for political asylum by 

the time their father is promoted out of 
the precinct. And although eldest broth-
er Franny tries to fill his father’s boots 
by taking up his managerial duties, no 
one thinks they have to play by the 
rules when their brother’s the referee. 
So when the semiautomatic slaughter of 
four cops is found trailing back to the 
family’s front door, Ray’s investigation 
quickly uncovers more dirt than can be 
swept under the living-room rug. 

Cutting out corruption before it spreads with the 
etiquette of a field surgeon, the brothers procrastinate  
turning on one another. And aggravated by the New 
York Post’s mudracking headline news, the demise that 
ensues only escalates  heated tempers, drug market syn-
ergies and 10-gauge Tylenol remedies.

Boasting an indictment of New York’s corrupt police 
politics and belligerent racial tensions Tom Wolfe 
would be proud of, camera work capturing the city’s 
urban milieu packs shot-by-shot frames with claustro-
phobic mise en scene. Director of photography Declan 
Quinn puts into effect the dense and austere shades of 
a prison-gray palette, cramming fire escapes and chain-
link fences into shots with more layers than a shingled 
roof. Even when the trite cop-out of close-ups and chase 
scenes on cameras that jangle like key chains lead the

CLAN OF BADGERS CAUGHT IN OWN CROSSFIRE



12  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2008

T he album will never die. I don’t care about iTunes’ influence or the fact that no one pays for music anymore — there’s still 
classic comfort and elegance in a thoughtful 
arrangement of songs whose sum is greater than 
its parts. Deerhunter’s third LP Microcastle is 
album validation without indulgence, a halluci-
nogenic and reflective love letter to the Strokes, 
and one of 2008’s bests. This time ATL’s odd 
garage quartet ditches the overwrought ambi-
ent tracks that bogged down ’06’s Cryptograms, 
cleans up the noise (unless they needed it for 
dramatic effect) and embraces artistic concision 
that could only come from experience.

Microcastle fits together like a Lego kit, 
dependant on each piece to support the struc-
ture and imbue it with character. Intro segue 
“Cover Me (Slowly)” establishes a lethar-
gic and contented tone of tremolo vox and 
lazy snare hits. Without it, the following 
“Agoraphobia” wouldn’t have nearly the same 
hypnotic impact — its  refrain of “Cover 
me/ comfort me” is deceptively simple but 
will wear out your brain from contagion, 
and the song’s jangly guitar arpeggios don’t 
overwhelm the vocals. Every role in DH is 
so attuned that nobody overpowers the rest. 
Although lead singer/guitarist Bradford Cox 

may be Deerhunter’s damaged visionary, gui-
tarist Lockett Pundt contributes some low-
end vocal mystique and sleepy-eyed bassist 
Josh Fauver collabs with precision drummer 
Moses Archuleta to create a driving rhythm 
section without excess. 

And then there’s the title track, creeping 
along for a couple minutes with Cox’s croon 
and some bright strumming, before all four 
jump in to punch you in the skull over and 
over so that you’re forced to headbang.

Although Microcastle has three-song cycles 
from Cox’s oft-visited teenage persona, a batch 
of immediate gems that could all be singles 

and a closer that saves all the real noise for the 
record’s last minutes, Deerhunter’s alienation 
and dread are best summarized by “Calvary 
Scars”’ sole lyric: “Crucified on a cross in front 
of all my closest friends.” Georgia’s lauded 
four-piece may have polished itself shiny with 
clean settings and charming melodies, but just 
below the sheen is a weirdness that most folks 
would never back. Watch yourself Radiohead, 
cause another compound word just threw the 
gauntlet.

Umphrey’s McGee

Keane
■ Perfect Symmetry
INTERSCOPE

K eane, the band that battled Coldplay for the top spot on melancholy music playlists a few years back, has reinvented itself with Perfect 
Symmetry. The group’s quintessentially brooding 
piano ballads have given way to unabashed retro 
synthpop — a transition that, despite sounding 
dubious at best, works. 

Tom Chapin’s clear, bright vocals humanize 
the album’s super-synthetic background, helping 
Keane channel the ’80s while maintaining fresh 
rhythms and harnessing instrumental oddities.

Keane has certainly not neglected its piano-
centered roots, skillfully layering acoustic keys 
over funkalicious bass and wound-up synthesiz-
ers. It toys around with the drum machine but 
generally stays true to its rock roots via drum kit 
and sporadic guitar (especially in “Pretend That 
You’re Alone,” which also features saxophone). 
While the album is very upbeat (almost to a 
fault — by the third song we’re ready to don a 

sideways ponytail and do dance aerobics in the 
living room), there are a few reminescent tracks 
that return to Keane’s piano-bass-drum founda-
tion, including “You Don’t See Me” and “Playing 
Along,” which offer the album its necessary 
acoustic balance — reminding us that, yes, this 
really is Keane, after all.

Symmetry’s pinnacle is definitely “Black 
Burning Heart,” which underscores Chaplin’s 
impressive range by marrying a gently pressing 
piano with expansive electro-symphonics. And 
deluxe-version bonus track “Love Is the End” 
is a sweet and spare little love waltz not to be 
missed.

Solid overall — Keane’s latest foray into new 
territory does the ’80s justice without forgetting 
the roots that won them pop reverence.

Secret Machines
■ Secret Machines
TSM

L ack of an original title doesn’t always mean lack of original material, as Secret Machines’ eponymous third album proves. The band’s 
newest effort combines conventional rock sensi-
bilities — high-powered guitars and heavy bass 
lines — with their trademark psychedelic swells 
and reflective, spaced-out lyrics. 

The album takes a slow start on designated 
single “Atomic Heels.” With lead singer Brandon 
Curtis’ ploddingly straightforward vocals urged 
by a pulsating guitar, it’s the most radio-friendly 
(and least interesting) track on the disc — but 
don’t let it fool you. The palatable rock core 
quickly merges with a more prog-tinged style on 
tracks like the electro-powered anthem “Have I 
Run Out” which channels a Killers-David Bowie 
mashup. “Now You’re Gone” shifts styles again, 
as Curtis wails a resounding, “It’s too late.” His 
echoing, restrained expression of heartache and 
lost hope is where Secret Machines really shines. 

The rock ballad then lets loose with rabid strum-
ming reminiscent of U2’s guitar hero, the Edge 
(an appropriate influence, seeing as how Secret 
Machines toured with the Irish legends in ’06).

But not all is well in the land of machines  — 
closing track “The Fire is Waiting” runs just over 
11 minutes, leaving you exhilarated and slightly 
confused, stuck somewhere between artful narra-
tive and confused acid trip. 

While Secret Machines plows on after the 
departure of guitarist and backing vocalist 
Benjamin Curtis, their latest solid effort doesn’t 
quite live up to the hype of their first two albums. 
While the same experimentation is there, Secret 
Machines lacks the sprawling stadium-rock results 
of past endeavors. Nonetheless, the Machines take 
us on a trip worth talking about.

Margot and the Nuclear So & So’s
■ Not Animal
EPIC 

A fter their forgettable sophomore slump The Daytrotter Sessions EP, Margot and the Nuclear So & So’s crash back into the barely 
contained chaos of drug-influenced instrumentals 
and acidic lyrics with a split double album. Due 
to band-label disagreements, Animal! indicates 
Margot’s version and Not Animal denotes Epic’s 
edition of the band’s second LP. As the former is 
only available on vinyl for a whopping $24.98, 
the downloadable Not Animal is  preferred by the 
masses. And no wonder — listening to its crooning 
vocals, hyper electronic-acoustic-synth layering 
and cymbal-happy outbursts is like attending a 
crazed cosmic party to which everyone is invited.

Though vocalist Richard Edwards genetical-
ly matches Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben 
Gibbard note for notoriously bland note, a gene 
or two from Conor Oberst infuses some much-
needed desperation. Combined with broad lyrical 
strokes on “Broadripple Is Burning” — “And if my 
woman was a fire/ She’d burn out before I wake/ 
And be replaced by pints of whiskey/ Cigarettes 

and outer space” — Margot captures the essence 
of suburban sprawl and alcohol-tinged anguish. A 
gorgeous acoustic intro on “Cold, Kind and Lemon 
Eyes” morphs into an otherworldly trip, layered 
first with smoke-fogged piano, then heartbeat 
drums and finally a crescendo to an orchestral 
climax. “Pages Written on a Wall” takes us to the 
circus, picking up elephantine trumpets, rollick-
ing drum beats and a steaming electric guitar on 
the way. 

However, not every track is a trip down the 
rabbit hole. Not Animal’s suggestively titled “Real 
Naked Girls” and “Hello Vagina” wade through 
annoying feedback muck at a disastrously plodding 
pace. Still, Margot manages to speak in pictures we 
all understand — ex-lover vengeance, city isolation 
— conveying a vulnerability within the madness 
that could reach even the most closeted student 
study-holics.

first half-hour, the coarse texture that follows 
pulls it from its rut. 

Keeping close to the chime of N.Y.’s asphalt 
jungle, the slang and machismo rubbed into 
the story gets old trying to be young faster than 
you’d think.

Although all three  manage to pull off their 
lines with believable Irish accents (despite other 
second-rate Latino actors) the gun-drawn clash-
es between plainclothes cops and unarmed thugs 
oversaturates too many scenes in vulgar banter. 
Accompanied by grotesque tactics of coercion 
with household appliances and censured shad-
owing, the Grand Theft Auto appeal sullies 
any attempts at festival aspirations. Eventually 
succumbing to St. Patrick’s Day fist-fights and 7-
Eleven hostage hysterics, the controlled momen-
tum that kept tension unravels into sensational-
ized violence by the film’s frantic end.

While Peter Travis will undoubtedly bless 
Carnahan’s movie posters with kind words (as he 
does for nearly every one of his films), “Pride and 
Glory” lacks the igneous cut and clarity Scorsese 
refined in his mean street slicks. Characters lack 
depth, personality and, above all else believable 
emotions. Even if Scorsese sometimes sacrifices 
the realism of characters for the personification 
of principles, they exist outside of the film’s shitty 
situation. 

When papa cop remarks to Ray that it’s the 
nature of all things to leak (with the subtlety 
of J.K. Rowling) we’re supposed to remem-
ber those lines and somehow wonder at the 
film’s ability to weave such narrative tech-
niques when leaks burst into floods. Instead, 
O’Connor takes a family doomed to fall apart, 
and inserting a camera midway, expects the 
audience to marvel at the razed collapse of a 
condemned house. 

GRAND-THEFT SHOOTER NEEDS 
MORE THAN TALKIE AVATARS 

▶ PRIDE, from page 11

U gly doesn’t come easy to Kevin Barnes, non-fruit ringleader to Georgia gay-pride brigade Of Montreal. Despite his 
most furious and synth-frothing efforts to 
roughen up last year’s Hissing Fauna, Are You 
the Destroyer?, its post-breakup freak-outs 
couldn’t help but wiggle into all our happy 
places; a seizuring 12-minute centerpiece, 
even at its peak of schizoid dissonance, had 
us rosy-cheeked and bobble-heading to an 
assault of nasally suicide notes.

Though he’s apparently over that Nina bitch, 
Barnes’ shift in persona from emotional wreck 
(albeit a sassy one) to drag-queen alter-ego 
Georgie Fruit (ever the sexaholic life of the 
afterparty) hardly marks a new willingness 
to just get us in the mood already, like we all 
know he could — no, this pretty boy will go 
down fighting, a prickly tumbleweed in spikes 
and cheesy heels. Barnes grasps for tension 
wherever he can, heaping opener “Nonpareil 
of Flavor” in a thick wall of fallout (Skeletal 
Lamping’s padlock for the weak at heart), then 
hanging us helpless in the sweet hammock of 
“Touched Something’s Hollow,” only to break 
into a befuddling midalbum costume party that 
sees Barnes, ever the stubborn individual, cop-
ping a slew of outside shticks. 

“Women’s Studies Victims” (props for 
the song title) bottoms out with Cake raps 
and ’80s shit-pop from the Rocky Horror 

dungeons, followed by skeezy Jimmy Fallon 
falsetto on “St. Exquisite’s Confessions” — 
which only momentarily reaches Midnite 
Vultures sexy status with lines like “There’s 
so much anger and pain/ But come and see, 
there’s still some gentle people fucking to 
‘Strawberry Letter 23.’”

Following the midalbum crisis, fresh-
ly determined to simultaneously coax and 
deter the dance party, Barnes struts out 
blowing grapefruity loads like never before. 
The greater second half of Lamping takes a 
new approach toward avoiding likeability 
— we will stroke our chin-hairs to his art, 
goddammit, and we will right well appreciate 
the reaches of his torment — by stuffing as 
many insta-orgasmic hooks as humanly pos-
sible into each others’ every orifice. 

The oft-imitated indie God kills two 
birds with one stone by spraying all pending 
attempts to cop his flow by hipsters-with-
cute-instruments in acceleration-mud on 
his way into orbit, far too light on his feet 
to be followed by an untrained eye. This 
labyrinthal multimedia project may be com-
posed of same-old Of Montreal signatures, 
but don’t expect its verse-by-verse incohe-
sion to come prechoreographed.

cry, in fact, from performing original 
material.

“My own songs are a direct line to 
my heart and soul; but if it’s [someone 
else’s] really good song you can relate 
to, it can feel like your own,” she 
said. “Lyrically, ‘All I Want’ feels like 
something I could relate to. You know 
— you hear a song on the radio, and 
you feel like that song is for you.”

Eons later, in the cold, hard reality 
of 2008, the now 19-year-old Kitchell 
is bumped up a weight class to make 
room for the new class of impression-
able young prodigies. And here lies 
the difference between child actors 
and child musicians: A big screen 
will dry them up and wear them out, 
but a studio can only hone an aging 
set of musical skills. Indeed, Kitchell’s 
significant leap in age and creative 
interest is proofed all over September 
2008’s energetic This Storm, light-
years more mature and equipped with 
Grammy-toting producer Malcolm 
Burn, who’s worked with such girl 
power as Patti Smith and Emmylou 
Harris, to pull her from the child-star 
training wheels.  

“Malcolm is a sort of genius,” she 
said. “This was the first time I felt like 
I was really being an artist, because 
he was really supportive of playing 
around.”

It shows — in her far more com-
plicated poetic liberties, the pauses 
for much-needed tension, even the 
scrunch of her face in delivery. But 
she’s entering a much harsher world 
of critics no longer trying to spare her 
pubescent, open-diary feelings: “This 
one garnered more negative response 
and that was harder for me,” she said. 
“The bad ones make you feel like 
shit.” She came into the game young 
and moldable, and for that, sounds 
a little like everybody — hit snappi-
ness of KT Tunstall, hip shadows of 
Feist, off-kilt fringe-skirting of Nellie 
McKay. “I’m lucky enough to be able 
to write these songs,” she said. “I’m 
writing them to share with people. 
We all feel these things, we’re alone, 
life is beautiful and hard.” Guess only 
time will tell if the coffee crowd stays 
true.

Sonya Kitchell will play live on 
campus at the Loft with the Slip on 
Oct. 27.

DARK HUMOR 
LIGHTS TRITE 
THEMES OF
DEPRESSION 

dispirit the play — until the yelp-
ing prayers and hollering gospel tunes 
of sex-crazed preacher Sister Bessie 
(Catherine Curtin) resound. Purging 
the Lesters of their sins, she hypo-
critically — and nowhere near subtly 
— proceeds to seduce Dude (Sam 
Rosen), the youngest of the Lesters’ 17 
children, into marriage with the prom-
ise of a spanking new automobile. 

Meanwhile, Ada struggles relent-
lessly to rein in her favorite daughter, 
Pearl (Mary Deaton), who manages to 
escape the burly embrace of her short-
tempered husband, Lov (Chris Reed). 
When Lov, now out on the prowl, 
offers Jeeter monetary compensation 
for his daughter, Pearl hides in the 
recesses of her family’s house, only to 
paradoxically expose the tenacity of 
Ada’s character and Harding’s pow-
erful performance in her character’s 
ultimate self-sacrifice.

Jeeter’s impish whims, Ada’s dead-
pan humor and Sister Bessie’s unbri-
dled sexuality combined with the 
dark humor that laces the plot come 
together to animate “Tobacco Road,” 
an otherwise predictable account of a 
dysfunctional family weathering the 
Great Depression.

Clinging to institutions of the past, 
the Lesters remain perplexed with the 
changing present and suspended in 
its accumulating complexities — this, 
perhaps, is their fatal flaw. 

Jeeter, for example, roots himself in 
family tradition, arguing that because 
of his ancestral claim to the land, he 
cannot forfeit it to the bank. However, 
present family dynamics slap him in 
the face without remorse. Dude con-
descendingly orders him, “Boy, you 
keep away from me when I tell you.”  
Jeeter and Sister Bessie, similarly, 
though in theory, pledging themselves 
to Christianity regularly manifest their 
sexuality in public. 

More than anything else, aesthet-
ics disappoint in “Tobacco Road.” 
While the sepia lighting of certain 
scenes render them picturesque, the 
lighting anachronistically converts the 
play’s appearance to that of a classic 
Western. Similarly, Jeeter’s asides to 
the audience, while most often provid-
ing comedic relief, end up being sprin-
kled and noncontiguous throughout 
the play, detracting from the plot and 
demanding a stretch of imagination 
to understand the implications of the 
play’s incoherent staging.

Toothless though they may be, the 
Lesters nonetheless bite off more of the 
Great Depression than they can chew. 
In the overdone tradition of Steinbeck, 
from their shambles and nothingness 
arises profound humanity. Despite its 
inherent triteness, “Tobacco Road” 
serves up a wide range of emotions 
that compensates for the Lesters’ own 
lack of sustenance. As the current eco-
nomic recession ensues, it serves as a 
timely reminder to tackle the present 
with integrity.

Phillies, Jimmy Rollins went the unset-
tling route when — while calling it 
how he saw it — the former MVP said 
that Philadelphia fans were a little bit 
fair-weather. While most sports fans 
would agree with this assessment, and 
add that Philadelphia fans are also kind 
of jerks and smell like wet garbage, 
it’s usually not a great idea to insult 
the people you want cheering for you. 
McCain’s anger has shown through 
during screaming matches with the 
press on his “Straight-Talk Express” 
(and “Air Straight-Talk”), debates with 
his opponents and whenever he sees 
youngsters using that damned text-
messaging contraption.

The comparisons might also extend 
to the teams’ managers and the can-
didates’ running mates. Rays skipper 
Joe Maddon and Democratic vice-
presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden, 
in addition to sharing the greatest first 
name ever, share a wealth of experience 
in their respective fields. Furthermore, 
both seem to disregard their previous 
experience, Maddon with the Angels, 
Biden in the Senate and from previ-
ously running for president, because of 
decisions or speeches that seem a little 
off. On the other side, Phillies manager 
Charlie Manuel and Republican vice-
presidential nominee Gov. Sarah Palin 
are both … sexy?

All right, so that might be where 
the comparisons end. The World Series 
will definitely not get the same ratings 
as the debates or even recent “Saturday 
Night Live” episodes, and that’s not a 
bad thing. Choosing the next leader for 
our country probably deserves a little 
more attention than who will become 
the next baseball team to visit that lead-
er. Nonetheless, the Rays vs. Phillies is 
a World Series worth cheering for. It 
shows that a team in Tampa Bay with 
the 29th-lowest payroll and a team in 
Philadelphia that chose not to com-
pete in acquiring players with other big 
market opponents can both make it to 
the final stages of the MLB season.

Truthfully, baseball has proven time 
and again that there is no magical 
formula to winning a championship. 
Getting hot at the right time can carry 
you far, and then a great pitching per-
formance or an offensive exhibition on 
the other side can end your momen-
tum in a heartbeat. Few would have 
predicted that these teams would meet 
in the end, even as the playoffs began, 
and anyone who thought the Rays 
would make it this far at the start of the 
season is a liar. Still, both teams have 
been able to overcome flashier squads, 
higher payrolls and better stories to 
make it here.

The Phillies have a dominant 
offense, even with Ryan Howard strug-
gling thus far through the postsea-
son. If Howard, Rollins, Utley and Pat 
Burrell all heat up in the next week, 

all the facial hair in the world won’t 
save Matt Garza. Though no pitcher 
is dumb enough to throw Matt Stairs 
the only pitch he is physically able to 
hit again (thanks Jonathon Broxton), 
the Phillies nonetheless have found 
great value in pieces like Jayson Werth 
and Shane Victorino that other teams 
thought they could survive without. 
Cole Hamels is the only legitimate ace 
in this entire series and has the ability 
to put together a Josh Beckett or Randy 
Johnson/Curt Schilling-esque perfor-
mance to single-handedly keep his 
team alive. Unfortunately, Brett Myers 
is nowhere near as reliable and Jamie 
Moyer is so old that Moyer has prob-
ably already written down any “Jamie 
Moyer is so old” jokes that I could 
insert here in his papyrus notebook.

The Rays lack any bona fide offen-
sive superstar, though Longoria looks 
like the Next Big Thing and BJ Upton 
has nearly matched his season home-
run total (nine) with an AL record-
tying seven in the playoffs. The Rays 
also rely on a staunch defense, with 
Akinori Iwamura making what has 
been a mostly seamless transition in 
his first season as a second-baseman 
and Carl Crawford, Upton and the 
rotation of Fernando Perez, Gabe Gross 
and Rocco Baldelli adding up to one of 
the fastest, though sometimes mistake-
prone, outfields ever. Scott Kazmir is 
looked to as the leader of the pitching 
staff, and though he hasn’t gone deep 
in a game since July, it was only after 
he was pulled that Boston was able to 
produce anything in their miraculous 
game-five comeback. James Shields has 
been better overall during the season 
and Garza made the Rays trade of 
Delmon Young look even better with 
his MVP performance in the ALCS.

The matchup looks — on paper at 
least — like it should break the monot-
ony of recent World Series sweeps. 
The Phillies bullpen looks in better 
shape, with Brad Lidge and his “bridge” 
of relievers providing experience. The 
Rays, on the other hand, have had 
a shaky bullpen at best. Yet, David 
Price gave fans of other AL teams rea-
son to worry for years to come with 
his relief performance in game seven 
against Boston. If Maddon elects to 
send Price out there more and ignore 
Dan Wheeler, the Rays have a tough, 
if untested, relief corps. The delay that 
the Phillies had to endure might end 
up making a difference, as it did for 
halting the Rockies’ surge last season. 
While most sports enjoy extra time 
to heal, sitting for a week might mess 
with the Phillies’ momentum and lead 
to a slow start from Hamels. It’s a crazy 
proposition to think the Rays could 
really win the World Series, but in this 
election season, it looks like the youth 
vote has it.

Joe goes with: Rays in six, Obama 
in ’08.

the things we worked on the course at 
home was to be patient early on, so we 
could come in strong during the second 
part of the race.”

On Oct. 11, the teams competed at 
home for the Triton Classic. Known for 
its high level of difficulty and woodsy 
environment, the UCSD course has 
provided excellent preparation for the 
championships. 

“Mentally it’s easier because while it’s 
got some good hills in it, there’s much 
less turning,” senior and top Triton fin-
isher Jake LeVieux said of the course at 
Glen Helen Regional Park. “You can see 
much farther in front of you — unlike 
our course at home — even as far as a 
quarter mile in front of you, and a lot of 
it is pavement. So it’s a totally different 
feeling than racing at home.”

With the cross country season 
winding down to its last few critical 
events, the race on Oct. 25 serves as a 
measuring stick for the Tritons. 

“The [CCAA Conference 

Championships] are going to be good 
for us because once we have this race, 
we’ll be able to compare ourselves to 
how well we are doing in the region,” 
LeVieux said. 

The event also provides the Tritons 
with an opportunity to face returning 
opponents. 

“The competition is going to be 
awesome because we’ve raced [Cal Poly] 
Pomona and Chico before,” LeVieux 
said. “[Junior Jesse Morrill] is also going 
to try and race down one of the Pomona 
guys. I’m nervous and excited at the 
same time.”

Marked as the final event before 
NCAA regionals, the conference cham-
pionships supply the harriers with much-
needed energy as they make their last 
dash toward the most defining races of 
the season — the NCAA West Regional 
and the National Championships, which 
are set for November.

ing and refining their skills.
“We emphasize simple hitting 

and simple pitching,” Gerckens said. 
“We are trying to improve their fun-
damentals and help them develop 
muscle memory.” 

Three new pitchers and two new 
fielders came in 
this season to help 
fill the senior void. 
The freshmen will 
have to learn how 
to mesh with the 
rest of the older 
members of the 
team, as well as 
adjust to competi-
tion at the colle-
giate level. 

Upperclassmen 
are also look-
ing to use the fall 
season to their advantage, however. 
Junior catcher Nicole Saari is ready to 
improve upon a season in which she 
started all 56 games for the Tritons 
after being named the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Freshman of the Year in her first 
season. To her, the fall games are 
all about becoming more proficient, 
coming together as a team and getting 

pumped for the upcoming season. 
“I want to get better at hitting 

and make sure no balls get past me,” 
Saari said. 

Expectations are high as the 
Tritons have set lofty goals for them-
selves. 

“I want to get to the playoffs and 
go to nationals 
this year,” Saari 
said.

Gerckens is 
happy with what 
they has seen 
from the play-
ers.

“They have 
done a lot of 
good things,” 
Gerckens said. 
“They have a 
lot of promise 
but also a lot of 

work to do.” 
The two victories in the fall games 

have been a collective team effort. With 
a solid returning group from last sea-
son, along with some fresh faces, the 
Triton softball team is ready to make 
the 2008-09 season one to remember.

Readers can contact Hani Farah at 
hfarah@ucsd.edu. 

“It was a physical game and we 
kept our concentration when it was 
hard to,” he said. “It was really a 
grind-it-out game and I thought 
our guys did a great job.”

Choi pointed to strong training 
sessions prior to the match  as a key 
reason for the victory.

“We have committed to win-
ning our games in practice,” he 
said. “Playing the No. 4 team in the 
nation with the season on the line 
motivated us to work a lot harder.”

Fernandez agreed that the team 
has turned the intensity up a notch 
heading into the final parts of the 
schedule.

“Everybody is showing up to 
practice fired up,” he said. “It has 
been a great environment.”

The Tritons will have to use 
their newfound momentum head-
ing into the final week of confer-
ence play. While the team will need 
a little luck, its hopes for postsea-
son competition are still alive if it 
can win its last three matches. 

UCSD will play its final home 
contest of the season against Seattle 
Pacific University on Oct. 25 in 
a nonconference matchup before 
the Tritons take to the road to 
finish up conference play. They 
will travel north to face Cal State 
San Bernardino on Oct. 31 and 
finish the regular season against 
Cal Poly Pomona on Nov. 2. The 
squad played both sides during its 
last home stand, beating Cal Poly 
Pomona 3-0 on Sept. 26 and falling 
to Cal State San Bernardino 3-0 on 
Sept. 28.

After suffering a poentially career-ending 
injury, the senior midfielder returned to 

action for the first time this season on Oct. 
19 against Cal State Los Angeles.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2008

By Brent Westcott
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S SOCCER — The men’s soc-
cer team made its conference home 
finale count in a big way on Oct. 
19, downing No. 4 Cal State Los 
Angeles 1-0 at Triton Soccer Field. 
Senior forward Tony Fernandez 
scored the game winner late in 
the second half, in a match that 
seemed destined to end in a score-
less draw. 

The win moves the Tritons’ 
overall record to 8-5-2 and their 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association record to 5-5-2. The 
win was the first at home since a 3-
0 triumph against Cal Poly Pomona 
on Sept. 26 and the second in the 
past three matches.

The afternoon clash resembled a 
typical CCAA match from the start, 
with both teams bringing physical 
play to the pitch. Chances were few 
and far between for both sides, but 
the Tritons capitalized on one of 
their opportunities with less than 
10 minutes left to play. In the 83rd 
minute, senior forward Tom Caplan 
crossed a ball from the right side of 
the field into the box, where junior 
midfielder Tony Choi was streaking 
toward the goal. Choi made a great 
touch on the ball and dropped it 
back to a trailing Fernandez, who 
hammered the ball into the back 
of the net. 

The goal was the third of the 
season for Fernandez and his big-
gest score to date. Fernandez also 
led the Triton attack with two shots. 
Caplan, Choi and junior midfield-
er Shane Micheil added one shot 
each. 

“The last time we played them 
we gave up a weak goal and we 
really thought we should have won 
that game,” Fernandez said. “They 
were on our field and there was no 

way we were going to let them get 
away with a victory.”

Fernandez’s goal was certainly 
the highlight of the match, but it 
was hardly the only reason for the 
victory. The Triton defense came 
up huge, led by senior goalkeeper 
Peter Akman, who made six saves 
to post his sixth clean sheet of the 
season. UCSD was out-shot 11-5 
and the Golden Eagles held a stun-
ning corner kick advantage of 8-0. 

But the players in the squad dug 
their collective heels in on defense 
to keep Cal State Los Angeles off 
the score sheet.

Head coach John Pascale credit-
ed his team for standing its ground 
against one of the more talented 
teams at the Division-II level in a 
match that featured a total of 30 
fouls and five yellow cards.

The World Series has finally arrived and, contrary to popu-lar opinion, Manny Ramirez 
neither plays for nor has played for 
either of the two teams. While a nation 
of Dodgers and Red Sox bandwagon 
fans aimlessly wanders, waiting to pur-
chase either a new Evan Longoria or 
Chase Utley jersey, the Tampa Bay Rays 
and Philadelphia Phillies now enter the 
final stage of the MLB playoffs.

Watching the Rays rip up what 
looked to be another miraculous Red 
Sox comeback en route to their third 
World Series title in the last three years, 
many found comparisons of this squad 
to previous out-of-nowhere contend-
ers. The Rays’ worst-to-first approach 
seemed to rival that of the legendary 
1969 New York Mets, or maybe a fel-

low Floridian expansion team like the 
1997 Marlins, or possibly what they 
were displaying was the hustle and 
tenacity of a team like the 2002 Angels. 
However, as we enter the final weeks of 
election season, maybe the best com-
parison for the Rays and fellow World 
Series participant the Phillies is to the 
two major-party (sorry, Ralph Nader) 
presidential candidates.

The youth and energy the Rays 
have displayed, downing battle-tested 
division opponents in the New York 
Yankees and the Red Sox to take the 
AL East crown, mirrors the surge that 
Sen. Barack Obama exhibited in pass-
ing former vice-presidential candidate 
John Edwards and former-first-lady-
turned-politician Hillary Clinton in 
winning the Democratic nomina-
tion for president. The Philadelphia 
Phillies, like Sen. John McCain, also 
looked to be out of the race early on, 
lacking any of the big moves that divi-
sional foes the Mets made in acquiring 
Johan Santana, or that Republican rival 
Mitt Romney made by harnessing the 
power of his magical underpants. Still, 
the Phillies were able to use the experi-
ence from passing the Mets at the wire 
last year and then took it a step further 
by not settling for a playoff appearance 
and riding three Cole Hamels victories 
to the World Series. McCain similarly 
relied on his experience from having 
faced off with President George W. 
Bush in 2000 to make it to the top 
of the Republican heap, rather than 
settle for the grating “graceful loser” 
role again. 

Obama and the Rays share a ten-
dency for overusing phrases that really 
don’t make that much sense. In the 
case of the Rays, “nine equals eight” 
might sound nice with nine players, 
playing nine innings to get one of the 
eight playoff spots, but the education 
of young Tampa Bay fans (I’m sure 
they got some this season) is being 
put at serious risk. Obama’s platform 
of “change you can believe in” would 
work, since there is definitely change 
we can’t believe in. However, there 
is serious doubt that this politician, 
no matter how long he’s been out of 
Washington, will truly change the 
entire American political system as 
we know it.

McCain and the Phillies both exhib-
it a straightforward, undeniable anger 
that can be uplifting — or unsettling 
— to their base. For the Philadelphia

CROSS COUNTRY — Set to sprint 
back into action this Saturday, the 
Triton cross country teams will trav-
el to San Bernardino, Calif., to com-
pete in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Conference 
Championships. With the competi-
tion coming from 11 different schools, 
the Triton harriers will race against a 
diverse field of runners. Both the men 
and women’s teams rank among the top 
25 in the nation in NCAA Division II, 
so the Tritons will bring elite competi-
tion to the event. 

UCSD has fared well in each 
of its meets thus far, winning three 
team titles. Last month at Glen Helen 
Regional Park in San Bernardino, both 
teams swept their races at the Coyote 
Invitational as the Tritons posted dual 
first-place finishes. An easy confidence 
booster, the teams’ preparation for this 
weekend’s race was mostly a matter of 
fine-tuning technique. 

“We continued with our training,” 
head coach Nate Garcia said. “Essentially 
we just made some adjustments to get 
[the runners] ready for the highest level 
of competition.”

According to Garcia, the runners’ 
strategies will amount to jumpstarting 
their manpower when it matters most.

“We want to be in a position where 
we are the strongest team in the second 
half of races,” Garcia said. “Some of

SOFTBALL — With a perfect record 
two games into the fall season, the 
softball team has started off strong. 
The Tritons won both games of 
a double-header against Palomar 
College 6-4 and 2-0, and will host 
five more games this season. While 
the games in the fall season do not 
count in the overall standings, they 
are by no means unimportant.  

Last year’s team had its share of 
ups and downs. The Tritons had 
an impressive regular season run, 
winning 32 games and climbing 
as high as No. 8 in the national 
standings. However, the team was 
upset in the opening game of the 
NCAA Division-II West Regional 
Championships, losing 6-4 to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. Top-seeded 
Humboldt State University later 
eliminated the Tritons 3-1. Even 
though last season did not end 
with UCSD hoisting a trophy, the 
team made strides throughout the 
campaign and looks to make this 
season even better, working hard in 
practice and playing hard in the fall 
season games. 

Improvement is the name of the 
game during the fall season. Head 
coach Patti Gerckens stressed the 
importance of building fundamen-
tal skills and overall team play in 
preparation for the regular season. 
This season, the team has the chal-
lenge of filling the hole left by five 
recently graduated seniors. Replacing 

the contributions of the seniors both 
on and off the field will be tough, 
but Gerckens has faith in the team 
this year.

“The seniors we lost will be very 
hard to replace,” she said. “We are 

looking for good leadership and with 
time we will be OK.” 

Along with new leaders stepping 
up, the Tritons are constantly polish-

Tritons Rely on Rookies to Rejuvenate Squad

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE
The UCSD softball team features five new freshmen to replace graduated seniors including 
pitcher Melissa Ward, who was named to the All-West Region Second Team last season. 

Fielding five freshmen, 
UCSD’s softball team 
looks to improve on last 
season’s disappointing 
playoff exit.

ANDREW RICCI/GUARDIAN
After struggling to score goals for much of the season, the scoreless game against Cal State Los Angeles late into the second period looked all too familiar 
to the Tritons. Senior forward Tony Fernandez was able to break the tie in the 83rd minute of regulation with the game’s only goal to put UCSD on top.
