"KLOS in coordination with

Without any stretch of the 
imagination, the firm of Wolf &

the households of Southern 
California. Be it radio an-

nouncements for their shows or 
their Concert Guide, or by the 
ads they place in most 
newspapers, this best known of 
Southern California's rock 
promotional firms has made its 

. presence known. 
But how did this organization 

come to be? The story, as it turns 
out, evolves along with the entire 
spectrum of rock music. 

The middle '60s saw very little 
activity in the realm of rock 
concert promotions. It was, to 
say the least, a vast and mostly 
untapped resource. But the 
arrival of the Beatles in Los 
Angeles in 1965 seemed to change 
all that. 

Steve Wolf, who started out in 
show business at the Universal 
Studios mailroom, along with 
Bob Ewbanks, best known as 
"The Newlywed Game" emcee, 
made good use of a golden

opportunity by forming Concert Associates and 
producing two Ikatle shows at the Hollywood Bowl. 

The following years saw the dep~rture ~~ E.wban~s, 
and Concert Associates changed Its affilIatIon with 
ABC to Filmways, (which eventually found the same 
fate a the "The Beverly Hillbillies ," one of Filmways' 
presentations.) . . 

In 1967 Wolf collaborated with Jim RIssmIller , a 
former theology student turned booking agent, to 
form the Concert As ociates that , in 1975, became 
Wolf & Rissmiller Concerts. 

Today Wolf & Ris miller Concerts is at th e 
forefront of the rock n' roll scene in Southern 
California. In addition to the production of con~er . , 
the organization has a s ubsidiary in the ProfeSSIOnal 
Skateboard Association of America. 1976 saw the 
advent of the Concert Guide, another offshoot of the 
firm. The Concert Guide provides seating c~art s .of 
every arena and concert hall. i~ Southern CaltforOla. 
attractively bound and contammg plenty of photos of 
rock tars and some helpful tips on ticket buying. 

The job of the promoter begins with t he securing of 
the date and concert hall . Says Riss.m~lIer, '.'!he 
promoter, manager and agent arrive a.t a JOInt decls!o,n 
regarding which facility the group. w!1I ~se. T~en . l~ s 
just a matter of matching the bUlldm~ s. avallablhty 
with a group' availability. Once the bIll IS complete, 
the next step is to start our radio and newspaper ad-
vertising campaign and print the tickets." 

As for the concert dollar, it "is divided as follows : 
I 5 percent goes to building. rent, . advertis~ng costs 
about eight percent, staffing mcludmg s~unty, stage 
hands, sound and lights and other productlo~ expenses 
are about 12 percent. The total expense IS usually 
about 50 percent. This leaves approximately 10 to 15 
percent to the promoter. From this we have t~ subtra~t 
our normal business expenses and the profIt margm

becomes even smaller. For us it's a volume Dusiness, 
some shows make it and some don't." 

Wolf added "it's important to realize that every 
person working the .night of the sh?w, f~om the 
musicians to the secunty guards, are bemg paId by the 
promoters." . 

By the day of the concert, "our productIon mana~er

Rainbow and Unicorn art, film deal a nd nature 
In the face of conflicting or 

unclea r forces of nature 
working in the environment, 
furtive thinkers of the past 
often created mythical beasts to 
deal with the situation. T he 
unicorn is o ne such beast. This 
bisexual creature was a symbol 
for the solar eclipse and a 
beacon of moral purity who was 
omnipotently aware of man 's 
existence in accord with his 
envi ronment. The unicorn came 
from afar after long intervals 
of time, to deliver mankind 
fro m oppres ion and play the 
role of M essiah .

With this bac kground, it is 

app ropriate that Louis Malle, 
director of famed Lacombe 
Lucien, included a unicorn in 
his new film, Black Moon, 
which is even titled in reference 
to a solar eclipse. The con· 
nicting force in Malle' s en· 
viro nment are men and women 
who have taken up arms against 
each other in fierce and brutal 
combat. The bisexual nature of 
the mythical unicorn is par-
ticularly appropriate here. . 

Cathryn H arrison, (Rex's 
granddaughter,) plays the lead 

visual " hallucinations" in 
Black Moon a re enhanced by 
the photography of Sven Nyk-
vist, I ngmar Be rgman 's 
photographer. Nykvist's effects 
give the film a very ~arm, 
human, sensual quality and 
heighten the beauty of nature. 

The so und effects add much 
to the credibility of the visuals. 
The amplified scratching of a 
centipede's feet shown crossing 
the surface of a rock produces 
such a vali d experience that the 
viewer can't he lp but cringe.

and magnification, Malle draws 
attention to and demands 
appreciation of small details of 
nature , at once making us aware 
of our increasing alienation 
from our natural environment. 

This alienation from nature is 
alluded to many times in the 
film . There are numerous shots 
of nude young chi ldren 
joyfully romping through the 
woods and fie lds with pigs, in 
co nstant celebration of their 
unity with nature and animals . 
Harrison comes in co ntact with 
various insects, snakes and 
animals throughout the film 
and is able to hear flowers cry as 
she carelessly steps on them. 
There are also scenes with an 
elderly woman In oral com-
munication with the ratlike tree 
roos, depicting a necessary 
interplay between woman and 
animals. 

Although Malle makes many 
implications about human 
intersexual and environmental 
relationships, he leads the 
viewer to no direct conclusions. 
The film is a sumptuous feast 
for the eyes. It is stranger than a 
trip th rough the looking-glass 
and as Invigo rating as a walk in 
the cou, t ry. 

For most of us, the next few weeks will be filled with anxiety and 
tension. as we put forth that last great effort of the Quarter to get 
everythmg done by finals week. Conveniently, there i a place of 
refuge from those feelings of depression and hopeles ness that 
often creep into our psyches at this time , turning our pleasant and 
lovable personalities into those of irritated monsters . 

The Quenzler Gallery , at 7919 Girard Ave. in La Jolla, ha~ been 
converted into a retreat of hope, where "A Rainbow of Colors and 
Thoughts" combats these pent-up (and sometimes released) ill 
feelings and tickles the child in us all. Throughout the month of 
March, Susie Reneau is presenting a show of her serigraphs. 

Reneau, a native of California, has studied art at the Los Angeles 
Immaculate Heart College and in Boston under designer and 
consultant Norman LaLiberte. She ha taught graphic workshop, 
illustrated fcmini t poetry and album cover, and is currently 
working on designs for chi ldren's books. Her work has been 
di tributed throughout the US and can also be seen at the Bazaar 
del Mundo in Old Town. 

"A Rainbow of Colors and Thoughts" i a election of Reneau' s 
work from the pa t seven years. The serigraphs are visual 
representations of original poetry. as well as poetry by such well-
know.n thinker as Robert Frost, ee cummings, the Beatles, Carl 
Sandburg, Emily Dickinson, Carl Rogers, Confucious, the Jef-
fer son Airplane and others. The principle inspirational themes of 
the works are love, hope, tenderness and beauty . One whole wall of 
the exhibit is dedicated to the subject of friendship. 

The simple figures in her prints represent a primitive, child-like 
innocence with on ly enough detail to capture a basic essence of the 
form being represented. 

The bright color u ed in the silk-screen eem to renect the 
warmth of sunshi ne in the same way that drops of water reneet the 
su n's rays to form a rainbow. The colors are visually stimu lating 
and, after a while, come to massage the soul with their warm glow.

As usual. the bulk of Jethro Tull's 
new album, Sonp From the Wood, is 
composed and sung by honcho Ian 
Anderson, and operates as proof 
positive that progressive rock can be as 
dUll as watching wool socks in spin dry. 

Anderson, years ago, was an in-
teresting . song writer who could write 
decent, pop oriented melodies with 
sidelong references to other styles, like 
old English folk, jazz, hard rock and the 
occasional hint of classical baroque . The 
key to his past success was that 
Anderson could put some distance 
between himself and his affectations, 
letting the songs (best typified by Tull's 
Benefit album) exist in an unpresuming 
vacuum, perfectly self-contained 
examples of imaginative songwriting. 

In later years, though, Anderson took 
himself to be a poet with something to 
say, usually cynical, and launched on a 
disastrous series of over indulgent, 
crammed, disjointed concept albums 
that in the excess of their prolix said 
more or less the same thing: Ian 
Anderson doesn't like people very 

much. 
The music, though, had good ideas, 

but the effect was diluted in execution. 
The good moments in Tull' s later music 
("Thick As A Brick," "Passion Play," 
"War Child," "Too Old To Rock and 
Roll") just were not worth the effort, 
because one had to wade through too 
much artsy-bullshit to get to them. 
Additionally, Anderson's predictable 
exhortations were obnoxious enough to 
warrant justifiable homocide. 

Sonp From The Wood, like any of 
Tull's releases, has its moments. Martin 
Barre's guitarwork is powerful, 
imaginative and nicely stated, given the 
circumstances. The rest of the band 
manages nicely on impressive chord 
changes that are otherwise gratuitous to 
anything else that's going on. 

Soap From The Wood is, in plain 
fact, a colorless reiteration of old moves 
that have been played to death . 
Someone should buy Anderson a gift 
tombstone. Too old to rock and roll 
indeed. -Ted Burke

Romeo and Juliet "'ree from so~mnlty" 
by Sara J. Lowen 

Staff Writer 

In past productions of Romeo and Juliet that I've 
seen, including the Old Globe production three years 
ago , directors approach the play with a reverence and 
solemnity for the tragic love affair which makes the 
play posi tively dreary . 

This interpretation usually portrays Romeo and 
Juliet ' as ethereal, noble young lovers who are the 
victims of cruel fate. Such productions usually sup-
press the humorous dialogue in the first half of the 
play, as if the characters are aware of the impending 
tragedy and feel they shouldn't be too lighthearted. 

The UCSD Drama Department's production of 
" Romeo and Juliet," under the direction of Eric 
Chri tmas. is refresningly free of this solemnity, for 
two reasons: it de-mys tifies the love affair of Romeo 
and Juliet and it emphasizes the comic characters and 
bawdy dialogue of the fir st half of the play. The play 
largely succeeds in the former, pointing out the im-
maturity of the love affair and its participant . In 
portraying the love affair, director Christmas has 
taken scriously what many directors seem to over-
look --. that Romeo is 16 and Juliet , 14 and , con-
sequ ently, their love affair is characterized 'by the 
seriollsness, the uncertainties and the impetuosity of 
teenage love .

exemplifies this view. Instead of a rapturous. verse-
. pouting Juliet, Denise Donato 's Juliet acts the way a 
14 year old in love for the first time might act --
frustrated, with pragmatism giving way to passion. 
Christopher Canaan's Romeo is nothing like the 
brave, gallant youth he is usually depicted as; he is 
absurdly sentimental, impulsive, impractical and 
wildly passionate. It is the (orce of Canaan's con-
sistently good perFormance which carries Christmas' 
interpretation. Canaan shows the character's tran-
sition from a weak, self-i ndulgent YQuth to passionate 
lover to a stronger Romeo who is willing to die for his 
love . Canaan also shows the dangerously passionate 
side of Romeo, givi ng credence to the interpretation 
that Romeo' s own impulsivene s, as well as forces 
outside of hi s control bring about his downfall. 

Donato's performance as Juliet is less even in 
quality. Donato successfully conveys Juliet's in-
nocence and willfulnes as well as her growing 
maturity 'and strength of character at the end of the 
play. At times, however, Donato seemed encumbered 
by her lines, either rushing them or reciting them by 
rote. • 

The second aspect of " Romeo and Juliet" that 
Christmas plays up _. the comedy -- is less successful. 
Where many productions play down the comedy of the 
first act of the play, this production played it rather 
too broadly , not allowing the lines to stand for 
themselves, but broadly underscoring them with 

, 

gestures. True, the humor was not intended to be 
subtle, but this humor grabs you by the shoulders and 
makes you laugh. 

Bill Davis' Mercutio contributed much to the verbal 
swo.rd play of the production. Davis was properly 
cymcal and devastatingly sarcastic, providing a good 
fool for Romeo's sentimentality in the first act of the 
play. H is command of the part was evident in the easy 
way in which he moved about the stage, alternatel¥ 
swaggering with youthful confidence and mincingly 
mocking Romeo. Davis and Leon Fricke, who played 
Tybalt, should be commended for the dexterous and 
competent manner in which they dueled . 

:rh~ rest of the cast 'provided able support for the 
prinCipals , Gerry Edwards played the part of Friar 
Laurence well , revealing the Friar's genuine ympathy 
For the lovers beneath his scolding exterior. Laurine 
Towler's portrayal of Juliet 's nur e was a mixed suc-
cess; Towler brought out the garrulousness and 
c.oarseness of the woman, but at times played her more 
like a young Mae West than the old bawd trying to be 
respectable. 

The spare use of props worked well in the sma\1 
theatre and was in keeping with Elizabethan-style of 
production . The costumes were effective , except for 
the Nurses' costume which looked Jamaican and 
seemed out of place.

1. Fall '76--After finishing my last final, at least for that quarter, I was feeling pretty good 
especially SInce I got out half an hour early . Anyway USB looked promising and I decided to get 
into the act (picture?) 

2. Spring '76--The La Costa International Tennis Classic always seems to fall during finals week . I 
shot more than six rolls of film and out of the over 200 pictures , this one of llie Nastase is my 
favorite . 
3. Spring '76--1 was eating lunch with some friends behind the Revelle Coffee Shop when t/:lis 
dog with a balloon walked by. I dropped whatever it was I was eating , grabbed my camera and 
this is the result . 
4. Winter '76--Last year , I was assigned to photograph an Atomic Cafe concert. As I walked in , 
the people In charge eyed my Nikkormat warily and voiced their disdain over the noise it would 
make. I shot anyway and after the concert was over , I asked some of the performers if they had 
heard anything and they replied "only our music ." 

5. Fall ·'76--Several other editors and I were aliowed to ride on the press bus with members of 
both the local and national press . We finally ended up at Lindbergh Field to see Jimmy Carter 
and "Peanut One" depart from San Diego . It was fun .

Drawing is a mirror to me ; it reflects most clearly when 
I'm tuned or when I'm unbalanced . The human figure is a 

centering point for me . When I begin drawing , if I am 
tight and need to loosen up, I can do some quick life 

studies. It wakes my Intuition and opens my visual 
perception . Presently I'm finding a lot of inspiration in the 

animals at the zoo; like humans they showa great l 
spectrum of moods and emotions, yet their forms are 

diverse enough to challenge the eye which helps to avoid 
lazy observation . In recent years I've come to consider art 

as a livelihood as well as Its personal value and am 
developing a career in illustration . Currently I am a 

student at Palomar Jr . College with plans to transfer to 
Long Beach State ; eventually leading to professional

But getting back to the original question, no we 
don't plan to expand into other markets too much 
because of the fact that those territories are already 
owned by other promoters. 
Tf: What kind of relationships do you have with other 
promoters? Is the competition cutthroat? . 
V"lon: Basically it is, with the other promoters In 
your territory. We're very competitive ~ith Paci.fic 
Presentations, Avalon and Fun Productions, whIch 
are all good promotional firms. We're going right 
after them. "We were here first" is one of the reasons 
we present so many shows and also we execute the 
shows properly and bands like to work for us . 

But then there are the promoters in different 
territories; we're· very friendly with Bill Graham in the 
Bay Area. 
Tf: Do you see a continuing upsurge in the concert 
market over the next few years? 
Vallon: Yes I do . I see the audience increasing every 
year with every kid that becomes 15 or 1'6 years old and 
is allowed out of the house. Every kid that turns that 
age is usually a music fan, and all of his brothers and 
sisters have already been coming, so they' re already ' 
part of the audience. 

Now there' s a point where you drop off. Once a kid 
is 20 or 21 where he might have been coming to 20 
shows a ye~r, he or she will become more selective and 
may come to only four or five a year. 
n: What happens when you're faced with the 
situation of only h~lf- filling an arena, or does that 
situation ever occur? 
Vallon: Oh sure ,it does. That's a good question 
because a lot of people think that whenever a sho~ is 
playing it is sold out. I've already had that question 
today. " This is sold out, isn't it?" No, it's not. It' s not 
anywh ere near sold out. This place will gros 'c1ose to 
$95 ,000 toni ght and we have approximately $50,000 
in . So we're going in wit h a little better than hal~. San 
Diego is notorious for doing a 10 t of last day bUSiness, 
which keeps your tomach churning unti l you finally 
get up there and sce that you did some business. 

Usually you nee.d to do about 75 percent to . 80 
percen t before you're even talking about maklOg 
dollar one as a promoter. You make all the money at 
the high end . There are all the expenses; you're paying 
the band a guarantee, you're renting the hall, you've 
got a huge stage crew, you did your advertising (print 
and radio.) All those are bills that you face no mailer 
how many people come to the show . 
n: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Wolf & 
Rissmiller initiated the outdoor stadium shows in 
Southern California . 
Vallon: That's right. The Who date at Anaheim in '71. 
n: What refinements have you made in the outdoor 
shows si nce their inception? 
Val Ion: We now have the stage behind the center field 
fence which makes the most sense. Wi th The Who 
Show'ln '7 1 we figured the way to do it would be to put 
the stage on home plate and use the Angel dugouts and 
locker rooms for dressing rooms. 

This concert was attended, it said 31;000 in the 
paper, I think we had 25,500 paid. That fille.d ~p the 
infield but now we're not allowed to 'lse the infIeld at 
a\l be~ause the ba\lclub needs it in good condition . 
Now that the Angels are going to be hot this year, 
they're very picayunish about that. 

So we did reline it. We put the stage out in cen-
terfield and played the other direction . We built a 
larger stage. The amplification of the show is getting 
much better . The Beach Boys concert there was done 
by a sound company called Claire Brother . Elton uses 
them. Elvis Presley and The Moody Blues all use them . 
They're really c hamps and they rea ll y made that 
ballpark sound good. 

Some of the production values, such as the big video 
sc reens, are very expensive and we usually won't 
undertake those without participation in the expense 
by the band. So it's usually the bands decision. It costs 
anywhere from 14 to 20 thousand dollars to do video. 
That's $14,000 for black and white and $20,000 for 
color. 
IT: When you're setting up large stadium concerts do 
you u. e the headliner to entice other bands? 
ValIon: Yeah it's funny, when we did The Who in 
Anaheim Stad Ium last year, the bill was Little Feat, 
Rufus and T 1 Steve Gibbons Band. But there were a 
number of bJf)ds that just wanted to play on the date 

·because it WeS The Who. They have a lot of re\pect for 
them. 

Samc thin~ yi th the Stone. What' s funny about the 
Coliseum da e (Editors note: the 4th of July how that 
never happen d) is that we wert: trying to [Ie Bob , 
Marley. Bu arley wanted an enermOllS sum of 
money, mOl~ han we thought he was worth. And he 
wanted a guarantee that he would be onstage with the 
Stone~ at tht end of the show. 
IT: Let me pose a hypothetical que tion here . Would 
you prefer t gct the Rolling Stone~ to do five night. at 
the Forum rather than one outdoor show? 
Vallon: Ycs. Every time. As a producer, I would much 
rather see thcm in the smal ler situation . I really would . 
IT: Both for economic and aeMhetic rca on . 
Vallon: RighI. xactly. There are two of the grea test 

plu.,se~ I can think of. 
IT: To change topics herc, could you tell u about the 
now famou ~ KGB Chicken incident? 
Vallon: Well, the Fire Marshall ha a rule at the Sports 
Arena that ~ay,> you mu '>t keep the aisle~ dear for 
safety purpo~e., . They don't care if thc kids gct 1If) and 

IIiI.MllluMOS 

jump on the seats. but they do care if they clog the 
aisles. 

• 
' options you're going to find a way to comply with his 
wishes . 

Right when Aerosmith came on, we had a young, 
rowdy crowd that started jamming the aisles . So the 
Fire Marshall said that if the aisles are clogged early 
you're going to be faced with two options: one, you're 
going to run the show with the house lights on or two, 
you're going to run with your plugs pulled. So that's a 
situation that you certainly don't want to face. And 
it's a law. When the Fire Marshall gives you those 

So here comes the duck in the chicken suit into the 
aisle, and he's like inciting the audience to come down. 
Apparently, the security ,uards asked him politely a 
couple of times to take hIS seat and not to incite the 
audience. The Fire Marshall is standing on the stage, 
left side, watching all this ~o dow!' .

.M 0 vi e S "Small Change" and .. Angel City" 
Tmffaut Sees Amazinq 
Grace in Children 

Picture masses of children flocking to see a Francois 
Truffaut film . Young connoisseurs of fine French 
cinema? Perhaps. But it's more likely they've come for 
the fun of seeing a film about themselves. 

And small wonder. This is not another Hollywood 
production, dripping with sentimentality. And not 
something that tritely depicts kids as angelic darlings. 

Truffaut's latest gem IS Sm .. 1 Change, a humorous, 
lighthearted tribute to childhood. It's a sensitive, 
candid look at the private world of kids . 

There really isn't a plot. The film just centers 
around school children in the French town of Thiers 
and everyday incidents in their lives. A deep 
fascination and respect for children is apparent on 
Truffaut's part. He allows us to see things from a 
ch ild's perspective . 

Parents, teachers and other adults take on a new 
light. They look more like authority figures, the big 
people that give the orders. Often they appear silly and 
unreasonable in the eyes of the children . For ex-
ample -- the strict teacher who insisted on the 
memorization of dull poetry. The tension in the 
classroom was great as she called on people to recite. 
The re was plenty of fidgeting and checking the clock . 
Fi nally, one lucky boy stalls long enough to be saved 
by the blessed ringing of the dismissal bell. 

Another example -- The parents of a little girl who 
wouldn't let her go to the res taurant with them because 
her li tt le handbag was too dirty . And just when she 
had washed it with the water from her fi shbowl 
c pecially for the occasion . Well, she got her revenge 
by havi ng the neighbors send a rescue basket of food 
after her parents le ft. 

A high point in the film involves an incredible 
miracle. A small boy of not more than th ree watches a 
cat fall out of a window in a high-ri se apartment 
building -- only to land safely on a nearby ledge. He 
does th e same, tumbling several stories down to the 
grass below . But he lives , bouncing to his feet with a 
laugh -- much to the amazement of onlookers. A 
pregnant woman recounts this baffling incident to her 
husband, proclaiming that "U's incredible, but kids 
are tough. They bounce back . Unlike adults, they can 
stand a lot more. " 
. Thi s seems to be what Truffaut wants to convey in 

hIS film: the toughness and also the gracefulness of 
kids. He does not limit his story to the happy and 
privi leged child, however. He also adds the tragedy of 
an abused welfare child. 

But the darkness never lingers for long in Small 
Change. There must always be mischief and humor 
and the seriousness must be brief. It is a Truffaut 
confection, full of humor and magic -- not a sen- _. 
timentaLlecture . It appropriately concludes on a happy 
note, with the joys of summer vacation and the 
promise of new adventures.

AnqeJ City: Brilliant, 
Confused Study of LA 
Jan Jost -- Angel City -- March 10 

My first reactions ttl this movie were scattered and 
vague, reflecting the ge neral attitude of the movie . I 
was puzzled by it; then I was confused; I thought it 
was awful; revised my opinion and now consider it 
remarkable. The man too k $6000 and created a movie 
with a hundred thousand dollar sheen . 

The reasons for this phenomenon are two-fold: 
spectacular camera work (especially the aerial shots (If 
the City of Angels and the incredible camera 
maneuvering on Southern California's freeway) and 
two di sparate performances by the film's central 
characters. It is unusual to find definable characters in 
what appears to be a film of a fi lm -- a movie maker's 
movie -- a film concerned with the hows and whys of 
movie making. Breaking with traditional avant-garde 
(yes, there is a tradition of the avant-garde), excellent 
performances were elicited from stage actor Bob 
Glaudini, formerly of Theatre 5 in San Diego, and 
Winifred Golden, actress-interviewer-critic . 

Angel City slips between above and underground as 
silently as the BMT uptown express at four in the 
afternoon, (rush hour) in New York, the Big Apple . 
Why do I use a New York allusion? Viewing LA 
through Jost's movie is distancing oneself three 
thousand miles away. We' re here but it 's there .. . 
looking at Southern California through the camera of 
Jan Jost and also the narrative structure-metaphor-
characterized by New York trained actor-director Bob 
Glaudini can be likened to the examination of amoeba ' 
thru an electron microscope. 

Alien life forms separated and not quite com-
prehended by the (machine) camera wielded -- no --
brandished by Jost (New Y~rk to California/subways 

Page 9 

to freeways.) The cars on the freeway appear 
protozoan while Glaudini is a Polaroid snap shot in 
perpetual motion. Cutting back to cars again on the 
freeway (thru Glaudini) the audience lias become the 
amoeba, a spectacular effect accomplished by Jost. If 
you can shift gears midway thru this dazzling camera 
work you find a movie concerned with 'how not to 
make a movie,' an anti-movie if you will, a slap at 
Hollywood . 

The actress Winifred Golden operates as the matrix . 
of the film, serving both as the body (corpse) and the 
cen tral tragic feature/figure in the film. As the 
murdered Mrs. Rexxon, (wife to a billionaire oil 
magnate,) ex bar-girl, now aspiring film star, her 
nervous breakdown while attempting to enact a 
monologue spo ken by Leni Reifinstaller (Hitler'S film-
maker propagandist,) in her big movie break combines 
in her performance a subdued Louise Lasser jux-
taposed over a strung-out Farrah Fawcett-Majors in 
immediate need of a fix . 

Her four minutes on screen function as the im-
portant referant after viewing what has appeared up 
until then a disjointed /slap-happy film . No direction, 
just a mobile and apparently alive camera. 

When reconstructing the film, you can not help but 
return to the luminescent image of Golden's enacted 
collapse -- shot in a bile green lighting -- which for 
some reason unknown to me, heightens the horror 
while minimalizing the eccentricity to what could have 
degenerated into a mannered imitative performance. 
Instead, you are assaulted with a woman whose 
growing hy teria manifests itself subtly onto the 
viewer, leaving the audience as exhausted as the actress 
playing the actress having the breakdown. 

Angel City bears a distant resemblance to Resnais' 
Stavisky, only a Stavl ky that might have been directed 
by Chiang Ching. Interjecting himself into the movie 
through voice overs during the freeway sequences and 
aerial shots, Jost distracts the viewer from his own 
camera work. This flaw was also noted in Rocky, 
wherein Sylvester Stallone dominates his own apparent 
autobiography. I hope Jost's fate is better than 
Madame Mao's while avoiding the canonization of 
Mr. Stallone. . 

Angel City is a fascinating/boring movie with 
confused politics, brilliant camera work and a stellar 
performance by the actress (Winifred Golden) who 
portrayed the murdered victim of capitalist greed. 
Antigone two thousand years later with a few 
alterations, but applicable nevertheless. A reluctant 
heroine forced into her pivotal position by the brittle 
nature of Jost's confused conceptualization of his own 
film . Her performance, along with the freeway and 
aerial shots, maintain a fluid, driving motion -- Ihe 
metaphor for Southern California: LA -- the city on 
wheels trapped on interstate overpasses and Ventura 
exits. Constantly appearing to be in motion , yet 
remaining (st ill)in the same approximate area.

T he ch icken takes a wi ng a t the securi ty gua rd with 
his wing, wh ich is actually a thi n!! taped o n to him , and 
it's a clo ed fi st r ight underneath it. So , yeah, the 
security took him o ut and pu t him into a wall, I gue s. 

So he's suing the securi ty com pany for assault a nd 
batt ery. Actuall y, it's not a suit , it's a criminal cha rge. 
So that's one o f the bummer areas. Bu t I reall y th ink 
the security guard was completely right in doing it. 
IT: What about the secu ri ty gua rd tha t was killed in 
Long Beach fo llowing the Lynrd Skynrd show? 
Vallon: R ight. He made a d umb move. He went o ut 
int o the parking lo t by himself after he had ejected a 
few guys, who a pparently went home a nd go t a knife. 
That kid was 18 years old. It was the first sho w he 
worked . 

But t ha t ' the first time we've had anything like that 
happen. I've never heard of anyone being ki lled. 
We've lost a few from drug ove rdoses a nd stu ff. T he 
Swing Auditorium in San Bernad ino is the favorite 
p lace for that. 
IT: Let's talk about the Concert Guide. 
Vallon: Brilliant book . Should win a Nobel Prize. 
IT: It eems like a novel idea. 

I rlWll1 h.1I OS WedDellday, Marcb l',1m 

Vallon: It' s not actually. The idea came from a book 
published by KFAC called "Where to Sit." What it 
wa was 50 seating charts stapled together with a 
similar cardboard cover on it. So a friend of mine, 
Robbie Davis, who's my radio salesman at KWEST, 
brought it to our attention. I'd seen it before but he 
had the idea . "Boy, this was a piece of shit ; we can 
really improve on it." 
IT: How did the company respond to the idea of 
doing omething other than concerts? 

Vallon and Wolf: You'd be smiling too if you grossed $6,000,000 last year. 
20,000. Saie are very good actually. 

Vallon: Basically, Robbie and I sat down with Jim and 
Steve and presented them an idea. We had a little 
prospectus typed up that I told Robbie to do. The. 
original idea was for the book to be 50 page long and 
was going to cost us eight grand to do. I wound up 
being over a hundred pages and co ting us somet hing 
like $30,000 to do. So we're a little over budget. 

IT: Will you publish the Concert Guide as lo ng as 
there is a market for it? 

to publis h all the dates that wcre coming in 1977 o n the 
calendar. 

We did call it the " Wo lf & R issm iller Concert 
Cal endar," since we liked the sound of the word 
concert fo ll owi ng Wolf & Rissm iller, because it's 
natural. 

Vallon: I think there will always be a market for it. 
ow my printing costs for it wi ll be way down, you 

know, to run it again. We'll update the book every 
year, change the pictures and stick a new calendar in it. 

We've got about 14,000 out now . We printed 
This give-away poster calendar, incide ntally, caused 

us no end of ha Ie . Everybody thought we were going 

But we got a lot of flack about that, when actually 
we were ju t trying to give them something else, you

know, like a poster on a wall . 
IT: Does Wolf & Rissmiller have a blacklist of per-
formers that they feel are too temperamental to deal 
with? 

Sly's band and personnel sho wed up, except for the 
man , So we waited and waited. After about lin hom, 
he wasn't there , so we said we'd refund a ll the money 
on Monday . 

IT:.A bi!1 has been introduced by Larry Kapiloff in 
California that w~uld put an end to ticket scalping. 
Vallon: I don't think you can make a rule like that. 
John Moss, who's been working for Mutual Ticket 

Agen~ies f?~ years, thinks that the right of an 
American cItizen to barter and trade is inviolate. If 
you've got something and you want to sell it to 
somebody else for a higher price, that is within your 
rights to do that. 

'IT: Didn' t that leave you with a tota l loss? 
Val Ion:" Tke only one that comes to mind' is Sly, who 
was famous years ago for not showing up. Sly's career 
has sort of declined and who knows, he could bounce 
ri ght back. God love him; he' s a great mu sician . 

We played a date at the Long Beach Arena that was 
sold out on a Saturday night. Sly showed up a n hour 
late. We finally got him onstage;he played and he was 
great . 

Vallon: Normally it would , But we paid Sly by check 
for the sellout at Long Beach the n ight before, which 
we promptl y cancelled payment on at 10 am on 
Monday, 

IT: So you don't see any change forthcoming? 

We were doing Oakland th~ next day, which should 
teach us to stay out of Bill Gra ham's territory, too. 
Oakland was Sly's hometown and the 5how wasn 't 
doing well. It was going to sell about 50 percent . All of 

We managed to recou p most of the loss ' in that 
si tuation . But that was a sit uation where we promised 
the hall ma nagers, t hat once we'd gotten burned, that 
as gentlemen we'd never work with the act again. Sly 
d id eventua lly show up. He shows up at midnight and 
the stage was struck . He just got there a little bit late, 
the son of a gun . 

Vallon: No. Not at all. As long as there's the demand 
there' s going to be scalping, 
IT: I've heard reports that Wolf & Rissmiller grossed 
$6 million last year. 
Vallon: Yeah, that was last year. That's amazing isn't 
it ? '

It finally comes down to commitment. 
When you don't like a course, it's hard to excel. The class gets 

tediou,;. The texts get boring. The lectures get dreadful. Your work 
suffers. And 0 do your grades. 

Compare that with the courses you really believe in. 
You care more. You try more. And without even noticing, you just 
naturally do better. 

It's true in school. It's true outside of school. 
For example, we believe theres just one way to brew 

Busch beer. The natural way. With natural ingredients. 
Natural carbonation. Natural ageing. 

We believe that's the best way to brew a beer. 
And when you believe in what you're 

doing, you just naturally do it better. 
Taste a Busch and we think you'll agree . 

. BUSCH. 
When)lOu beliae in what wu're doing, 

you just naturally do it better. "
