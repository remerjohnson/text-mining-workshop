Anderson's Kids Make 
UCSD 'Campaign' Stop 

John Jr., Eleanora, Di'ane Speak· 
BY J. BERESFORD·HOWE 

Staff Writu 
It' s almost . the perfect 

college vacation scam. 
Get Dad to run for 

President. He shouldn't run as 
part of a political party, 
though, because the primaries 
are held in the cold eastern 
winter. Have him run as an 
independent, so that he needs 
to petition to qualify for the 
ballot in each state. 

That means you can visit 
every state during the 
temperate months of June and 
July, after school. If you spend 
your sch~1 days in hot, sticky 
Washington, anyplace would 
be an improvement. 

That's sort of the situation in 
which Eleanora, Diane and 
John Anderson, Jr.' find 
themselves. Their father is 
running for President on what 
he calls the National Unity 
ticket, and he's sent his three 
children to California to get 
things going on the state's 
college campuses in his 
petition drive. 

while he was talking with my 
father. 1t was wierd. I've really 
liked him since I was 15 or 16, 
and I walked into a room and 
there he was. My father said 
afterward that he thought 
Taylor was a 'very serious 
young man." He's going to do 
some free concerts for us," the 
oldest of the Anderson 
offspring said. 

The "kids" (that's how they 
refer to themselves, though the 
youngest of them campaign-
ing is 20-year-old Diane) don't 
take themselves seriously as 
politicians. 

In response to one 
questioner at yesterday's 
Revelle Plaza, who wanted to 
know whether Anderson 
would continue President 
Carter's policy of trying to 
balance the budget, John, Jr. 
.said that he thought he would. 

"As his son," he added, "I 
can tell you that he can be a 
real cheapskate." 

He also suggested that his 
Dad would look individually at 
each defense department 

request for funding in order to 
determine where the waste 
was, an incredible task if 
anyone ever really tried it. 

His sisters jumped to the 
microphone to suggest that 
their father might not do that. 
They exchanged confused 
looks, and then Eleanora 
turned to the crowd and 
announced, "there's a little 
squabbling up here," then 
skillfully turned the question to 
a moral issue. 

"The important thing is 
programs for the young and 
the poor that just can't wait. 
We can cut back recreation 
centers, but we can't cut back 
on programs to help black 
people and young people," she 
said to the cheering crowd of 
about 200. 

The next question was 
about the space program. A 
young student wanted to know 
if an Anderson presidency 
would restore the commitment 
of John F. Kennedy to the 
nation's space program.

Looking Back, AS 
Sees 'Mixed Job' 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
A.Kiaw New. Editor 

" The biggest accomplishment of our AS Council was 
getting more people inoolved in more areas 01 the university 
community more successfully than ever before. " 

-Carlos Montalvo, fonner AS president 
" The majority of our efforts this past year were felt 

systemWide, concerning issues such as Proposition 9, the 
draft and voter registration. " 
-Kathleen Shanahan, fonner Revelle AS Representative 

"Despite educating students politically, we failed 
miserably at getting students involved and letting them know 
what the AS does and can do for them." 

-Linda Sabo, former External Affairs Commissioner 
Most 1979·80 AS Council members agree that informing 

students on issues of long-term importance took up a large 
portion of their energy over the past year. Yet considerable 

Conflict of Focus Seen 
debate exists over the merits of that policy. 

"The focus of the people on our AS was on off-campus 
issues, which were not of specific interest to the average 
student," Shanahan says. "We really didn 't deal enough with 
the needs of students here on campus." Current AS President 
Jeremy Charlton, she hopes , "can bring the AS back to the 
students and deal with their day-to-day concerns." 

Conversely, Montalvo feels "immediate, on-campus issues 
were a major concern of ours," and claims the AS became 
"the biggest mechanism for getting students involved on 
political, academic and social levels" this year. 

According to Montalvo, the AS: 
- doubled the funding capacity of SCURI , an organization 

that provides grants for undergraduate research; 
- placed approximately 250 students in internships 

through the AS Internship Office and the efforts of Director 
Jim Lofgren; 

-provided students with the ASsorted Vinyl Record Co-
Op, which may expand into jazz and classical areas next year 
due to its initial success; 

-gave more money to student organizations and media 
than any previous student government; 

-helped bring the Student Center Pub into existence by 
soliciting a $20,000 donation from the Chancellor; 

- took a strong stance on political issues such as 
Proposition 9, the draft, sexual harrassment and the 
chancellor's search process; 

-headed a largely successful voter registration drive on 
campus. 

Sabo believes that the accomplishments of the Council 
have gone lar'lely unnoticed on campus due to the lack of an

lAbor Trends Cause 
Miami Eruption 

BY MARTIN BROWN 

T he twin eruptions at Mt. St. Helens and in Miami have more in common than one might expect. The 
earthquake which blew the lid off the volcano was 

merely the final step in a complex series of geological tensions 
which had been building for many years. 

Similarly, the acquittal of four policemen charged with. killing 
a Black man was, like the earthquake, only the spark that Igmted 
Iong.standing social tensions building in Miami's BI~ck 
community. In neither eruption was there a clear understanding 
of what those tensions really stemmed from. 

Martin Brown, who teaches economics at the University of 
San Francisco, is an associate editor (or Pacific News Service. 

In the case of the Miami riot, however, certain economic 
trends underlay the overt racism which sparked the riot. And it !s 
clear thoae economic realities are not unique to Miami; they are 
heating up the social magma in every American city. 

'The fact is that after decades of struggle toward social and 
economic well: being, real progress for a large proportion of 
Black Americana has been halted, or even reversed. The 
setbacks stem not only from personal and instittttional racism, 
but are deeply imbedded in profound structural change that are 
re·shaPnI the national economy of the 19801. Chief among 
those changes is the rapid dismantling of the American 
manufac:turinJ sector, which for decades served as a vital 
pathway for Blacks to the American promise of a well·paid job 
and economic security. 

U few people understand the economic changes, the Black 
urban poor of Miami and other cities do understand the results: 
1be yawning gap between poverty and affluence i. increasingly 
difficult to bridge. Where once - even recently - there was 
hope and aspiration, today there is increasing frustration and a 
serIIe 01 betrayal. 

1be reversal of recent gains for Blacks foDows a time when the 
old barriers to fulllOCiai and economic integration were being 
battered down and the future looked encouraging. The ratio of 
Black to White family income improved steadily for Black. 
during the 19601, according to the census bureau. But by the 
mid· 70s the ratio had peaked and gone into decline. 

Similarly, the ratio of Black to White unemployment 
improved during the 1960., but by 1978, Black unemployment 
was again more than twice as severe as White unemployment. 
And while Black employment in blue collar industrial work 
improved dramatically between 1940 and 1977 (from 38 
percent of the Black working force to 58 percent), it was 
precisely those kinds of jObs which were slated to disappear with 
the decline and exodus of the manufacturing sector. 

I ndeed, the manufacturing sector, which provided Blacks with their major employment and income gains during the mid-century, is still vanishing at an 
alarming pace. Thirty years ago half of all workers were 
employed in manufacturing, mining, construction, 
transportation and utilities. By 1978, only about one·third of all 
workers were employed in this sector. According to the United 
Auto Workers union, some 15 million blue collar jobs have been 
lost in the last eight years. 

This massive decline has left behind what many economists 
call a two·tiered economy - one tier featuring high.level, high. 
paid professional/technical workers and the other offering low· 
paid jobs in the booming service sector, with littl~ or no 
opportunity for advancement. 

The best jobs continue to be held primarily by White 
Americans whose geographic mobility , educational credentials 
and network of personal contacts provide their entry into the 
upper tier of the economy . Fully 40 percent of all White working 
men are employed in professional , managerial or administrative 
positions. Only about 12 percent of the Black male labor force 
are employed in such jobs . 

The low·level jobs of the growing service sector - clerks, 
dishwashers, waiters, hotel workers , etc. - are eagerly 
grabbed up by the burgeoning new immigrant populations that 
will accept sub·standard wages and working conditions. Second 
and third generation urban Blacks are -naturally disinclined to 
compete with immigrants for the kinds of poor jobs which their 
grandparents held. History and a generation of economic 
progress is not easily reversed.

Kent St.: It Can Happen Again

In the streets we see bumper

Congressmen say ' in 
interviews that "we've got to

morality." Legislation for draft 
registratiolJ"' is now past the 
House and in the Senate. Is it 
not safe to say that war 
publicity is on the rise? 

In light of this trend, Rick 

Greene's article on Kent State 
is a very timely one. It is very 
much worth our while at this 
time to think about the events 
at Kent State and of the larger 
questions that they raise. For 
as statistically insignificant as 
they were, the Kent State 
deaths taught us a lesson we 
can never allow ourselves to 
forget, namely, that students 
on campuses in Ohio or 
California or any other place 

would be shot and killed just as 
readily as farmers in Viet Nam 
or Cambodia. 

As Greene pointed out , we 
are all those four who died at 
Kent State. They were 
students just like ourselves . 
Under other circumstances it 
might have been us .

Even Rubber Snakes Make Mistakes 
Editor: • l'

ing the rubber snakes installed 
in and around the lower Muir 
quad. As ·Mr. Anderson 
correctly assumed , the snakes 
he referred to were originally 
deployed to discourage the 

seasonal influx of swallows · 
from nesting there. 

Of course, we have nothing

Ticket · Agencies a Consumer 
'Rip-Off,' Not Public Service 
Editor: 

Everyone, or almost 
everyone, knows that concert 
prices are going up - way up. 
Has it ever occurred to you to 
wonder why? Concert tickets 
are costing you more, while 
the seals you receive for your 
money are further back from 
the stage, At least with normal 
innation we get comparative 
quality. This should not annoy 
you if the selected ticket 
agencies in San Diego County 
continue to have their way 
with your tickets . Both music 
goers and sports lovers know 
how hard it is to get good seats 
nowadays - for any price. 

The selected ticket agencies 
believe that they are doing a 
public service by hoarding all 
the best seals for a popular 
concert, and "reserving" them 
for their preferred clientele. 
Not only do the agencies 
reserve tickets, they "save" 
some for the concert-goer who 
waits until the last minute , only 
to find out that all the tickets 
are sold out. In such an 
unfortunate predicament, our 
friendly neighborhood ticket 
agency is only too happy to be 
of service. There are always 
anxious workers, waiting with 

hands ready, to satisfy your 
musical cravings - for the 
right price. 

One may ask, "Why· are 
ticket agencies needed in the 
first place?" Because, the 
accused say, concerts and 
other entertainment events are 
often sold out prematurely and 
many people are left without 

. tickets; or, what is worse, 
some must buy them for an 
extra couple of dollars from a 
scalper! 

The next question follows, 
"Why do concerts and other 
entertainment events get sold 
out so often, while the best 
seats are unavailable for 
public sale at the proper box· 
office price?" Answer : 
Because the ticket services 
buy all the best seats and sell 
them back to you for almost (if 
not more than) double the 
retail cost. This problem" not 
new to many of the young 
concert·goers in San Diego 
County. 

There is, of course, no 
solution. But to allow these 
legal "scalpers" to reserve the 
best rock, jazz and popular 
concert tickets is a consumer

MAMMOTH LAKES, 
Calif. - The third and largest

injuring at least four persons, 
touching off a gas explosion, 
triggering landslides and 
causing widespread minor 
damage. 

Aftershocks continued to 
rumble through the area as the 
state Office of Emergency 
Services urged residents to 
prepare for even more 
temblors. 

"The quakes are all related.

Four people were admitted 
to Mammoth Hospital 
yesterday, mostly for 
treatment of lacerations

falling objects , said hospital 
spokeswoman Nancy Dunbar. 

OES spokeswoman Anita

Yesterday's quake was felt 
as far away as Los Angeles , 
300 miles south; Stockton, 
130 miles west; and 
Sacramento, 150 miles 
northwest of the epicenter. 

Seven people were treated

SAN DIEGO 
591 Camino de la Reina 
Suite 504 (704) 298·1157 



It's been a cold, grey 
spring in San Diego. Last 
year was so much nicer. 
We had lots of sunshine 
and wann beach weather. 

But the douds have 
been fonning not just in 
San Diego. A dark, 
forebodding cloud has 
been blighting the entire 
country. We appear 
headed for another dark 
era in our national history. 
Draft registration wil most 
likely begin this June. This 
insures that the clouds will 
grow even darker. This 
summer promises to be as 
different from the last as 
this spring has been from a 
year ago. 

Perhaps when the 
history of the twentieth 
century is written in a 
distant time, some 
historian will note the 
acceleration of alternating 
~ods of peace and war. 
The intervals between the 
two are collapsing. Now, 
barely five years since our 
final withdrawal from 
Vietnam, we are being told 
to prepare ourselves for 
the next "intervention," 
the next "limited war". 

This time so many 
myths have been shattered 
since the last war that 
people don't even know 
who or what to claim we 
are protecting ourselves 
against. Is it militant 
Islam? Russians in 
Afghanistan? Perhaps we 
can save Yugoslavia or 
maybe South Korea, 
whose citizens have the 
audacity to reject martial 
law. We could always find 
some dictator to reinstall to 
power.(The Shah is not 
quite up to it these days, 
but perhaps Somoza is 
weary of the riots in Miami 
and would like to return to 
Managua now.) If nothing 
else, we can protect 
ourselves against the 
hoardes of refugees who, 
despite high interest rates, 
high inflation and a 
recession, still think we 
have something to offer. 
Better yet, we can defend 
the national interest of 
Detroit and stop the 
invasion of small foreign 
cars; and if all else fails, we 
could bump off an Arab oil 
sheik or two, create a 
Middle East crisis and 
double the price of 
gasoline. That would show 
them we haven't lost our 
gusto. But, oh! for the 
"good old days" when 
there were just plain old 
commies around and 
everyone knew just what 
they were being asked to 
die for. 

My levity should be

tory humor. It is directed at

beneficiaries of its political, 
economic and ideological 
organization (as a whole, 
middle class male), to 
serve in its defense? My

Few would dispute this; 
and if war is the only 
available means then it 
may not be reasonable to 
ask me to fight. 

But what I am 
emphatically against 'are 
unnecessary wars. Wars 
fought for narrow 
economic and political 
interests. Wars fought on 
the basis of misguided 
ideological precepts (such 
as Arayan supremacy or 
anti·communism). Wars 
started by old men who, 
through some perversion 
of the political process, 
think they have the right to 
decide who will live and 
who will die; whose babies 
will have napalm dropped 
on them and what 
countries wilderness needs 

' to be defoliated. Above all, 
I am against wars started 
by men who feel they have 
the right to subjugate the 
rest of humanity to a 
political and economic 
system, which allows for 
their own maximum 
aggrandizement. This is 
what Hitler felt he had a 
right to do. 

Make no mistake about

"free" world is the defense 
of the right of monopoly 
capital to seek maximum 
rates of profit through

ment of a capitalist class. 
The defense of the 
"Communist" world is the 
defense of the right of a 
one· party dictatorship to 
subjugate humankind to its 
own rigid definition of 

r~ality and to keep 
humanity subservient to its 
own narrow interest. To 
deny this is to deny 
modern history. 

What I am saying is 
that: yes, this country does 
have a right to ask me to 
defend its national interest, 
but I (and the people being 
aS,ked to fight) will decide 
what that interest is and 
when it is truly threatened. 
If we have learned 
anything from the 
Vietnam War, it should be 
not to allow the "experts," 
the old men shouting pious 
shibboleths, the presidents 
during reelection cam· 
paigns, to make the 
decision on who lives and 
who dies. Too often their 
decisions have had no 
relation to the true national 
mterest as we would define 
it. 

Furthermore, we should 
have learned the danger of 
giving carte' blanche in the 
fonn of the draft to these 
"leaders. " Too often they 
have abused our trust. 

This is why I will resist 
efforts to register anyone 
for the draft. When I have 
decided that a real threat 
exists and that I am willing 
to sacrafice my ' life then I 
will stop resisting efforts to 
register people for the drat. 
If J am not willing to go to 
war right now, then I am 
not willing to allow others 
to be prepared to go to 
protect us against an 
unknown threat. If you 
have not decided that you 
are ready to be ' sent 
wherever the "experts" 
decide our national interest 
is being threatened then 
you too should resist 
efforts to register anyone 
for the draft and come to

UCSD Offers Much to Older Students 
.Colleg~ Programs Help 'Returnees' Find Their Way to Degrees 

BY JONATHON KROLL 
"Sometimes I get the feeling that the 

professors don't take me seriously, that 
I'm sort of a middle class housewife 
dilettante," says Julia Blake, a 36-year· 
old political science major. 

Older students, whether they are 
continuing a college education that they 
abandoned years ago or are starting 
fresh, face difficulties at UCSD. Not 
only must they cope with an 
environment geared toward 18 to 22-
year·olds, they must survive the rigors 
of academic life. 

"Some older students feel like they 
are not part of the community as a 
whole because of their age," says Mae 
Brown, coordinator of academic 
advising at Third College, "Some are 
also fearful of speaking in class because 
of the younger students, or are 
overwhelmed by the bureaucracy." 

Older students ' first hurdl e is 
overcoming the fear of "not being able 
to handle college," says Toni Doyle, a 
reentry student who left college in 1952 
to get married. 

"When I first saw UCSD it was so

sophisticated," she says. "Everything 
seemed so grand, and ivory.towered. I 
thought it was way beyond me." But 
Doyle enrolled, and has enjoyed it ever 
since. 

Blake shared this apprehension. "At 
first I didn't know whether I could 
survive. I had been out of high school 
for ten years and didn't know whether I 
was capable." Like many other older 
students here, she has survived and 
excelled, earning a 3.5 GPA. 

Another experience older students 
sometimes encounter is special 
treatment from professors. According 
to Songmin McCormick , 40, some 
professors do not acknowledge the 
older student, while others give them 
special attention. 

Some older students believe a few 
professors are even threatened by their 
presence in the classroom. 

"Two professors won't answer any 
questions of mine, I think because of my 
age. They act like they have to prove 
me wrong," says Doyle. 

Many older students say they were 
initially intimidated by the younger 
students. "I didn't have any idea what to 
expect," says one woman returning to 
college after a 33-year absence. "I first 
thought that the younger students were 
absolutely brilliant, but I've learned 
since then they are not. " 

Some older students choose not to 
mingle with the younger students, 
feeling they have nothing in common. 
Others make the effort to overcome the 
age barrier and say it is well worth the 
effort. "I don 't think they treat me like 
one of the bunch, but once I get to know 
them they are very friendly," says 
Doyle. 

Dorothy Armstrong, who dropped 
out of college in the 1930's, has made 
many very close friends at UCSD, and 
spends time in the library and cafeteria 

with her younger colleagues. 
These reentry students often earn the 

admiration of their young friends . "I 
think it's great. It takes a lot of guts to go 
back to school," says James Geiger, a 
19-year-old Third College student. 

Occasionally, a younger student 
rebuffs an older classmate returning 
students say. "I can't talk to students 
who have trouble with their mother. 
They won't listen." says one reentry 

The older students are able to 
compare college life today to the past. 
Annstrong, in her 60's, says young 
people today are more open and honest. 

There was also more academic 
pressure in the 1930's she says. "C's 
were frowned on. If you got a C you had 
to see the dean," Armstrong recalls. 

Armstrong noti ces a broader 
spectrum of students going to college 
today . "To go to college then meant 
that your family could afford to send 
you. There were no scholarships or 
government loans." 

She says she is impressed by tht':

science fields . "The number of young 
girls in college is absolutely fantastic," 
she adds. 

Armstrong says there is more 
political pressure in the country today 
than there was when she first went to 
college. It was a time of pe?ce between 
the world wars, "Now you have the 
atomic bomb to worry about," she says. 

Armstrong says she lives and studies 
just like the younger students. "When I 
started again I thought, 'I'm older and I 
won't have to think about the girl-boy 
thing - I can savor the courses,' bul I 
started eating, liv.ing and studying just 
like a student." 

Like her compatriots she started 
studying until midnight and woke up at 
6 am. She said she didn't have time to 
watch television, and read only the 
headlines of the newspapers over coffee 
in the morning. 

Books, papers and notebooks were 
piled up allover the house, she says. "I 
even put off doing laundry for a couple 
of weeks," she adds. 

Another woman returning to school 
after retiring from a career notices the 
casual attitude of the youth here, 
"Everyone is supposed to be 'cool,' " 
she noles. 

She also believes that todaY'1 
students are more sophisticated and 
independent. "In my time the parents 
allowed you to go to school and the 
school took care of you after that. We 
didn't have the freedom that exists 
today," she says. 

Dorle, who went to college in the 
1950 s, finds a less carefree attitude at 
college today. "The kids don't speak 
up. They don't want to show their 
naivete. They are afraid to show that 
they are not sophisticated," she says. 

"In the 1950's I never heard of 
drugs. Drinking beer was the big thing,"

Local 'Beaches Draw Crowds 
as Schools Close for SUIDIDer 

Riptides, Unstable Currents Still Remain From Winter 
B" BARBARA HAAS 

Sport. Editor 
The summer solstice isn't due 

for another month, but as always 
happens this time of year in San 
Diego, people are already 
crowding the beaches. 

San Diego State University 
and some local community 
colleges have ended until fall, and 
in two more weeks all other 
schools will be out, causing a 
mass population shift to the coast 
and the bay. 

The spring, however , can be 
the most ~angerous time of year 
for beach.goers. 

Francisco diffs and freezing 
temperatures are absent. 

There are four basic types of 
beaches in the county , according 
to Wilson. Mission Bay and its 
inlets are not true beaches, but 
are pools of sea water that have 
made their way inland. 

Camping beaches proliferate 
the North County coastline, and 
surfing and recreational beaches 
extend the entire length of San 
Diego county Irom Oceanside to 
Imperial Beach.

The camping beaches 
clustered north of San 
Beach , and most 
reservations in advance. 
these places are already 
for summer, according to 

"The best spot for 
camping, which 
reservations, is San 
Beach, Wilson says. The 
"is really beautiful, very 
and easily accesible," 
San Onolre is located 
west of Old Highway 101, 
30 miles from the count~ 

The remainder of the 
strip is used for recrea.tion,.I. 

According to county lifeguard 
Bill Wilson, the ocean floor is 
rough and irregular. Large waves 
from the winter storms have 
caused holes and trenches in the 
floor, "which makes unstable 
currents and tricky riptides," he 
says. 

Mission Bay is a favorite spot 
for those who want to avoid big 
surf, surfers and crowd's. Families 
with small children or older 
individuals primarily frequent the 
Bay, although the Aquatic 
Center offers instruction in 
sailing, skiing, crew and other 
water sports for students and the 
general public.

But as summer progresses, the 

floor will even out and the tides 
should stabilize, Wilson says. 

Another phenomenon of 
spring beaches is the lack of sand. 
Rough ocean swells and high 
speed winds of winter have 
eroded the sand, dredging it out 
to sea, Wilson explains. In a 
month or two, the gentler summer 
breakers will deposit more sand 
onto the beach, which will remain 
until the next fall cyde. 

So San Diegans have an entire 
summer to enjoy what makes San 
Diego famous: the Pacific 
coastline. San Diego is known for 
some of the most beautiful 
beaches on the continent, and La 
Jolla ranks among the best in the 
world. The smog and pollution

Other high quality areas for

Sea Cliff Park, Grand View, 

CliUs, Ocean Beach and 
Point Lorna. 

Another popular place is 
Crown Point, where many 
beachgoers pilot jet skis around 
the calm water. Ski Beach, of 
course, is the area for water 
skiing, while Quivira Basin is the 
headquarters of the Aquatic 
Center.

Moonlight Beach, Spanish

But for those who prefer busy 
crowds, Pacific Beach and 
Mission Beach are ideal. 

La Jolla Cove should be 
avoided by serious sun·bathers, 
as the small confined area of sand 
attracts voyeurs, tourists and 
small children. 

Mission Beach and Pacific

condemned, ancient amusement 
park, interrupts the Boardwalk 
for a block, and is a Irequent

With its numerous fast food 
restaurants, Mission Boulevard is 
sometimes referred to as Junk 
Food Alley. Intermingled with 
these are some small cafes and 
expensive restaurants, such as 
The Old Mission Beach Cafe and 
The Old Ox. 

Once past Crystal Pier. the

Law Street, Diamond Street, and

Tom Hom and The Long Riders/Lynette Tom 

Western Films On the Rise 
BY L YNETIE TOM 

Aooociale Arb Editor 
There was a time when the 

number of weaterns on 
television and on motion 
picture Icreen. was as high as 
the number of space opera. 
today. As popularity of 
w'elternl dwindled , the 
westerns that were left were 
frequently just send·ups of the 
old .tyle. 

But the western has made a 
comeback of sorts, and two 
films, Tom Horn and The 
Long Riders, are here to prove 
it. 

1be first picture is about a 
man who services General 
CUlter as an interpreter and 
tracker in the Apache Wars. 
Diagrundled, Hom enters the 
Wyoming territory, where he 
has a run·in with prizefighter 
Gentleman Jim Corbell, who 
leaves him face down in the 
dirt. 

Hi. wail. reach the 
.ympathetic ears of John 
Coble, who hires him as a 
cowhand, then enIi.ts him as a 
stock detective to combat 
ftlltler •. 

When Hom performs his 
new duties too perfectly, the 
men, fearing that their secret 
arrangement with him will leak 
to the pres., plot to make hi, 
lharpshooting abilities work 
against him by framing Hom 
for the murder of a fifteen· 
year-old boy. 

The strength of Thomas 
McGuane and Bud Shrake's 

script lies in its portrait of Tom 
Horn as a man of simple 
pleasures and few necessities. 
The direction by William 
Wiard operates on this same 
back·to·basics level. George 
Greenville's cinematography 
of the hero framed against a 
wide angle panorama of the 
western horizon is reminiscent 
of the sprawling cowboys.and. 
Indians epics during the 
1930's and 1940's. 

Steve McQueen continues 
his career· long role of the 
plainspeaking and perennial 
lree spirit. Linda Evans plays 
his romantic interest, 
Gwendolen. The eighties have 

not liberated women's roles in 
the western, and she is the only 
woman to whom even passing 
attention is given in the film. 

S~m Pickens has a good bit 
part as Sheriff Sam 
Greedmore. 

The title of the second 
movie refers to the James· 
Younger gang, who for a 
decade were a terror to train 
conductors, bank owners and 
stagecoach drivers. The film 
follows the group from its 
formation in 1866 through the 
various successful holdups, to 
a brief respite in which the 
James and Younger brothers 
part · company for a set of 
separate adventures that end 
in their reunion for an attempt 
on the National Bank in 
Northfield, Minnesota and the 
subsequent capture of the 
Younger brothers, murder of 
Jesse James and finally the 
surrender of Frank James in 
1882. 

The screenplay, by Bill 
Bryden, Steven Phillip Smith 
and television denisons James 
and Stacy Keach, is a good 
blend of fact and 'peculation, 
and maintains a balance of 
tongue·in.cheek humor and 
fast·paced action. 

Walter Hill 's (The 
Warriors) direction of the 
shoot·out between the James· 
Younger gang and the 
Northfield townspeople is a 
blatant imitation of Sam 
Peckenpah's penchllnt for 
using slow motion techniques 

to glorify violence. 
Screen wipes, replacing a 

. scene slowly across the screen, 
are a television ' device and 
their appearance in The Long 
Riders detracts from the power 
generated by the cinemato· 
graphy. 

Freeman Davies' quick.cut 
editing more than makes up 
for the energy ' lost. Ry 
Cooder's quick country strings 
fill out the atmosphere of the 
post.Civil War period. 

Since James and Stacy 
Keach wrote and produced the 
film, they took the roles of 
Jesse and Frank James, 
respectively. The roles of 

Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger 
are performed by David, Keith 
and Robert Carradine. Dennis 
and Randy Quaid play Ed and 
Clell Miller . The parts of Bob 
and Charlie Ford are played 
by Christopher and Nicholas 
Guest. Supporting appearan· 
ces include James Whitmore, 
Jr. as the gang's pursuer, 
Pinkerton agent Jacob Rixley, 
and Pamela Reed (!) as Belle 
Starr. 

Tom Horn is now showing 
a t the La Jolla Village Square 
Theatres. The Long Riders is 
currently playing at the Center 
3 Cinemas. ' 

Del Mar Gallery Opens 
A new gallery has 

opened in Del Mar. 
Stratford Gallery , 

located on the second floor 
of Stratford Square, corner 
of Camino Del Mar and 
15th Street in Del Mar, will 
specialize in original 
contemporary art, from 
local North County and San 
Diego artists. 

The proprietors, Nur and 
Dr. Jack Sharpe, formerly 
oversaw a local gallery, 
showing batiks and folk art. 

The gallery will formally 
open Thursday, May 22, 
with a one man show, 
covering recent works of 
Gary R. Cantor. 

The artist graduated with 

a B.F.A . from th e 
University of Southern 
California in 1960. His 
paintings have been shown 
and collected in Calfornia 
and Arizona from 1961 . 
until 1968, when, except 
for a few hangings in the 
San Diego Fine Arts

Early Drop OK'd 
Continued (rom Palle I 
. Academic Senate Chair-
man Aaron Cicourel began 
the meeting by reading a letter 
from the Aasociated Students 
urging a delay on the vote until 
more .tuden·t input could be 
IOUiht. The letter included the 
re.ults of a recent poll 
indicating that students are 
.trongly opposed to the 

~. former chairman of 
the Committee on Educational 
Policy, then spoke, .aying he 
had clone "everything in my 
power to solicit .tudent 
• ugge.tions, other ,han 
standing on a soap-box in the 
middle of Revelle Plaza." 

Bond also laid the AS 
voting results were meaning. 
Ie .. because the questions that 
were posed to students were 
"misleading. " 

He added that the proposal 
allow. students more freedom 
by letting them drop any class 
without approval until the 
ninth week, although a "W" 
for withdraw! will be placed on 
a students' transcript if the 
drop takes place after the 
fourth week. 

A group of students who 
had attempted 10 defeat the 

I proposal had wanted the sixth 
week established as the 
earliett date the "W" could be 
noted on transcripts. 

Assistant Chancellor Pat 
Ledden argued that the 
proposal was unfair penalizing 
ituclenta for doing what the 
faculty often does. 

"If an experiment is not 
working out we often disregard 
the experiment. We should 
apply the .ame intellectual 
standards to students that we 
apply to ourselves, and not 
penalize them with a 'W' if 
they cha~e their minds about 
a coune,' Ledden said. 

Several faculty members, 
however, pointed out that 
some students take courses 
several times in an attempt to 
get a better grade. One 
unnamed college at UCSD 
was accused by several faculty 
members of allowing students 
to drop courses because of 
poor academic performance, 
even during the following 
quarter. 

Many faculty then agreed 
that the proposed change 
would more accurately reflect 
students' academic progress. 

Bond said that because 

students on financial aid must 
carry a minimum academic 
load of 12 units, students of 
limited resources are least able 
to take advantage of the 
current sixth week drop date, 
he said. 

Bond noted that students at 
UC Berkeley must petition to 
drop a class after the third 
week. Although UCSD's 
proposed policy is not nearly 
this strict, he believes the new 
policy will help the campus 
maintain rigorous academic 
standanla. 

"We get a lot of our students 
into law and medical schoels 
because of our tough 
reputation," he said. 

Bond also said he is 
confident that graduate 
schools will not hold a few 
"Wa" against students. 

Contrary to past remarks, 
Bond said that there has been 
little grade inflation during 
UCSD's short history, 
dispeling the argument that the 
current system has caused 
this. 

The current drop po~cy was 
established when UCSD first 
opened to accomodate the 
graduate student population. 
But some faculty including 
John Wheeler of the chemistry 
department, were surprised to 
learn after the meeting 
yesterday that the proposed 
change will also affect 
graduate students. 

Although not provided for 
in the proposal, professors will 
be expected to establish 
ground rules by the fourth 
week 01 the quarter, according 
to Bond. 

Some professors may find it 
difficult to establish an 
evaluation by the fourth week, 
in order to let students know 
how they are doing, Bond 
noted. 

But, Bond speculated that 
at least 50 percent of the 
faculty would ~ke to have an 
evaluation by the fourth week 
if possible. 

In reponse to undergradu-
ate Bob Spielmann's recent 
accusation that the drop 
proposal "was put forward by 
a core of very conservative 
faculty who - are not 
representative of the faculty at 
large," Bond called Spielmann 
a "politician." 

"The proposal w as put forth 
by concerned faculty, not 
conservative faculty ."

McCormick says younger 
students are under more 
pressure than she is because 
they must worry about the 
future. "I feel like school is a 
hobby. I can enjoy the classes 
because I can separate my 
occupation and schoo~ng," 
she adds. 

Blake compares the 
campus atmosphere to the 
1960'5. She cites a reduction 
of social interest and 
community goals on campus 
today. "There was an anti-war 
movement then, so everyone 
was a political activist." 

Blake says she is amazed at 
the amount of drugs on

I expected. The casual attitude 
towards drugs surprises nie. 
Of course, they bother me 
about smoking cigarettes," 
she adds .

Blacks Upset ~y Trend 
Continued (rom page 2 

Thus, with relatively few Blacks in the upper tier of the job 
market, and with surging numbers of immigrants taking the jobs 
in the lower tier, a huge proportion of urban Blacks have been 
left dangling in the middle - in the vacuum created in large part 
by the precipitous decline of the manufacturing sector. 

These trends have been produced by the structural 
transformation of the American economy. The progress that 
Blacks attained up until 1970 was largely dependent upon 
institutional channels of increased job opportunities. In the early 
years of the cen~ury , immigrant Black workers from the rural 
South were actively recruited by large Northern industrial 
corporations because they were willing to'work for lower wages 
and were almost totally immune to union organization. 

In the I 930s and 1940s many of these same Black industrial 
workers obtained equal pay for equal work and other kinds of 
equaltreatrnent as they became a crucial component of the New 
Deal and the new industrial unionism. In the 1950s and 1960s, 
Blacks began to obtain equal access to education, housing and 
jobs, largely .as a product of the civil rights struggle and resulting 
legislation. 

But in the 19705, these sources of progress were severely 
undermined. Traditional unionized industry left the industrial 
cities for. the suburbs,'the sunbelt, Europe, Japan and the Third 
World, leaving rising unemployment and degrading welfare 
dependency in the urban Black communities . 

At the same time, another major path of upward mobility for 
Blacks was also shrinking. Government employment, which In 
the 1960s and 1970s rose dramatically, included large numbers 
of Blacks' through aggressive affirmative action campaigns. But 
with the economy in decline, and with a middle-class tax revolt 
against government spending, these jobs peaked a'ld are now 
being cut. In today's economy, the key to getting good jobs is no 
longer the unions or the affirmative action programs of 
government. {t is increasingly personal resources that make the 
difference, particularly education, personal connections and 
geographic mobility. . 

But Blacks, still burdened by a legacy of past educational 
discrimination, are at a distinct disadvantage on every count. 
They lack the resources to obtain the ever.higher educational 
degrees needed for the best jobs. And, because so few Blacks 
have a place in the upper economic tier, they lack the network of 
family and friends who could give them a hand up. 

They are also relatively rooted in urban communities -
unlike new immigrants - by a combination of home ownership, 
family ties and responsibilities, and dependence on local social 
services . 

Thus, urban Blacks in the 'SOs find themselves trapped in an 
economic no man's land, the rising aspirations of a generation 
betrayed by irreversible forces over which they have no control. 

This is the reality for the Blacks of Miami - and of New York 
and San Francisco and Detroit and a dozen other American 
cities. It is a kind of institutional racism far more profound and 
cruel than that which motivated the civil rights movement of an 
earlier time. The fact that it stems from largely impersonal 
market forces rather than personal racist malice does not lessen 
its emotional impact, as Miami aptly demonstrated. Indeed, the 
emotional eruption in Miami spread as dark a pall across 
American as the volcanic ash that blotted out the sun.

AS Hindsight: SoDle 
Good, Bad TiDles

effective system of informing students. 

"The fact is, we did all these things - worked on the drop 
date, the amphitheater, voter registration - yet we never got 
out and told students about it, or listened to what they had to 
say," she says. 

"The AS Bulletin, which was at least a semblance of a 
newspaper last year, became something between a calendar 
and ;ncoherent rambling," Sabo says, adding that Charlton 
"should rejuvenate that instrument to inform students 
successfully next year." 

Personality conflicts and communication problems were 
two shortcomings retired council members attribute to their 
AS. 

"We saw many instances this "year of people bringing 
personal arguments ~ight out on the floor during council 
meetings," notes Bill T opkis, AS vice-president and former 
Activity Fee Commissioner. 

"This created unnecessary friction and discouraged people 
from coming to meetings," he says. 

AS Admor Randy Woodard believes the personality 
conflicts at AS meetings this year were unavoidable. 

"You can't place 22 people into positions of authority -
people who wiD undoubtedly represent certain special 
interests and organizations - and expect them to handle 
themselves in a totally professional manner for nine months," 
he says. 

"Past councils have experienced conflicts, just like this 
year's AS will. Student government puts students in a 
pressure-cooker situation," he concludes. 

Sabo believes that this year's election of a silly president 
ex~lifies the problems of the previous AS. 

"We weren't visible enough to students," she says. 
"Jeremy has already proven that getting out of· the Student 
Center is a high priority for him, something that will be very 
popular with students and hopefully increase participation in 
the AS." 

Topkis agrees, adding that "students wanted an alternative 
to the bureaucratic, unapproachable AS they saw last year, 
so they voted siDy. Jeremy is always arOl,md, out on Revelle 
Plaza with hi. hat on, and students can identify with him," he 
says. 

"I think it's going to be a good year," Topkis adds. 

John AnderlOn's three children, (I-r) EJeanora, Diane and John Jr. wait for q~estions 
from the crowd at yesterday'. Anderson for President rally on Revelle Plaza. 

Anderson Kids Find Support

"He wants to send my 
brother on the first launch," 
Eleanora said, and then sat 
down. 

Eleanora has been on the 
stump on and off since New 
Hampshire's February 
J>rimary, but John, Jr. and 
Diane haven't taken their 
commitment to their father's 
campaign as their top 
commitment. 

"I haven't been on some of 
the campaign literature so a lot 
of people aren't sure who I 
am," John said. Why wasn't 
he on the Anderson press 
packages? "I was off skiing at 

this great resort in New York," 
he explains. 

"I don't know anything 
about politics," Diane, who 
appeared bored during most of 
her three hour visit to campus 
said. 

"They had to teach me 
about most of the politics of 
this ." Were the three 
Anderson kids all there are? 
"No, I'm adopted," she 
teased. (There are two more, 
aged 16 and 4, who are back 
in Washington with their 
mother). 

She is certain about one 

thing. A questioner asked her 
whether she smoked 
marijuana, and she replied 
quickly, "I don't want to 
answer that...1 want to keep 
my personal life personal." 

John, who w~1 start a 
corporate banking job at 
Chase Manhatten in the fall, 
seemed almost as excited 
about his job as about his 
father. He spent lunch talking 
with. a local Anderson 
supporter about the problems 
involved in renting a place in 
Manhatten ("It's $800 a 
month, and the realtors w ant a 
$1,000 fee up front!")
