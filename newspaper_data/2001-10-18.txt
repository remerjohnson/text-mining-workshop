Over 175 pints given 
to SD Blood Bank 
Drive held on campus this week 
By SHARON SHAPIRO 
Contributing Writer 

tudent , faculty members and 
San Diego resident rolled up 
their sleeve to donate blood to 
the ' an Diego Blood Ba nk in the 
Price Center Ballroom A ,t'r It; 
Ocr. IS. 

Over 175 pints of blood were 
collected over a three-day period. 
Most donors gave about one pint 
of blood, a process tbat took about 
20 minutes. 

The blood collected this week 
will be sent to San Diego hospitals 
to replenish a supply somewhat 
depleted by donanons to New 
York after the Sept. II terrorist 
dltaclc.. 

"We don 't have a shortage, but 
blood IS always needed ," said 
Linda Misoni, a registered nurse 
with the San Diego Blood Bank. 

For those who are able and 
willing to donate blood, a con tn-
bution is always appreciated, 
Misont ;aid. 

She said T here has been an 
increase in blood donations in tbe 
past montb . 

"The public has been so won-

derful and generous," she said. 
"The response has been excel-
lent." 

Jessie Lee, a Roosevelt sopho-
more, donated blood Tuesday 
morning. 

" It has always been an interest 
to me," Lee said. "I've had a histO-
ry of family and friends who need-
ed blood, so I thought l-would help 
DUt." 

Workers at the blood bank rec-
ommend that donors prepare 
properly before donati ng blood. 

"¥ou hould eat a good break-
fast and drink a lot of fluids the 
day before," said blood bank 
worker Willie azareno. "You 
can't do this on the pur of the 
momt'nt. " 

Without proper preparation, 
your body can go into shock and 
cause you to feel lightbeaded or to 
pass Out, azarcno said. 

After givi ng blood, dOllors 
!!lUSt Sit and rest for at least 15 
minutes before resuming normal 
activity.

By JENNIFER THEUNE 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD Women 's Center 
unveiled a photography exhibit 
for breast cancer survivors Oct. 
16. The exhibit is part of Breast 
Healtb Awareness Month and 
will be displayed until Oct. 31 . 

The event was also intended 
to recruit a UCSD team for tbe 
annual Making Strides Against 
Breast Cancer Walk to be held 
Oct. 2 I in Balboa Park. 

Women's Center Director 
Nancy Loevinger described tbe 
photography exhibit as "classy 
and tasteful ." 

Physician and photographer 
An Myers took pictures of women 
who have survived breast cancer. 

Myers said his wife's struggle 
with breast cancer inspired him to 
take tbe pictures. He said he want-
ed to do a socially relevant project. 

"I want people to become 
desensitized to the image of tbese 
women as grotesque," Myers said. 
"Their whole being is not changed 
just because of breast cancer." 

The exhibit is open from 9 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There is also a 
table in the lobby of tbe Women 5 
Center witb free information

extension saves students 
1,000 waived fee in extra week 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Director of Student Healtb 
Services Dr. Brian Murray 
announced last week tbrough a 
letter to tbe A.S. Council tbat 
8,866 students completed waivers 
for tbe Undergraduate Student 
Healtb Insurance Plan. 

Murray said that tbe final 
count is still pending because 
SHS continued to accept waivers 
last week under special circum-
stances, Murray estimates the 
overall tally will be closer to 
8,900 waivers. Murray congratu-
lated tbe A.S. Council on its 
effort to extend tbe deadline. 

"It was grea t to work wi th 
A.S.," Murray said. "I was glad 
tbat A.S. gave tbeir opinions and 
got invol,ved - tbat was terrific." 

A.S. Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Kyle R. Biebesheimer 
shared Murray'S enthusiasm for 
the collaboration of the A.S. 
Council and SHS. 

"I'm glad tbat we could work 
togetber at finding the best way 
to market the waiver option to 
tbe student body," Biebesheimer 
said. "It was good working witb 
tbem; it was a good compromise. 
I really feel optimistic that tbere 
will be a lot better working rela-
tionship between A.S. and 
Student Healtb." 

Murray said tbat many stu-
dents might have unknowingly 
purchased USHIP for fall quar-
ter. He said tbat tbe A.S. Council 
helped prevent this by convi nc-
ing SHS JO extend the waiver

the students who 
did not want USHlP would not 
have to pay for it," he said. 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge said 
he agreed . 

"I'm extremely pleased about 
it," Dodge said. "We pulled togeth-
er well and pooled our resources 
and really worked to get the word 
out," 

The extra 1,000 students who 
waived USHIP saved a combined 
$163,000 - a figure that Dodge 
said he is very happy with. 

"That's an astonishing number 
- definitely something that A.S. is 
proud of," Dodge said. 

Biebesheimer also congratulat-

"A.S. is aware

Biebesheimer said. "We need to 
work together [with SHS] to find

Dbdge said that future coopera-

SHS is needed. 

"They were very administra tive-
Iy responsive to A.S. and to stu-

we need to have some discussion

StudentLink photos 
endanger a bias-
free atmosphere 

This quarter, the a.dministration made 
ph(~~o~ of ~tllden~s available to faculty and 
stnft via tudentLlIlk. The Gflrtr'dirf11 report-
ed on Oct. I I that member of the A.S. 
Council met to discuss concerns that the 
placement of the pictures on the Web vio-
late~ students' priva~y rights. 

The move to provide pictures of students 
on StudentLink was motivated by an under-
standable and honorable intent to improve 
the university's academic environment. 

The photos are useful to professors in 
that they can help them put faces to names. 
!1.0wever, their availabili ty presents possibil-

~tJ~s of abuse and could gi ve rise to serious 
IJ1fractlons of personal rights. These factors 
require a compromise on the is ue of 
StudentLink photos that would make all stu-
dents comfortable. 

'While we would all like to believe that 
professors are unbiased and impartial in 
their grading, it cannot be assumed that this 
is always the case. Givi ng a professor a ros-
ter that not only has tudents' names, class 
levels and majors, but also their images, 
makes racial bias much easier to carry out. 

Iso, professors would be able to Identify 
students who participate in class discussions, 
regardless of whether the student wishes to 
be known by name. Professors may develop 
unfavorable impressions of students based 
on their behavlOr in class or the opinions 
they express in discussion and allow this to 
influence evaluations meant to reflect only 
the quality of the work the student produces. 

While it is certainly possible now for a 
professor, with a little finagling, to find out 
a student's name against hiS or her wishes, 
the StudentLink photos make it much easier 
and create a wioespread potential for 'abuse. 

StudentLink representatives claim that 
they explored the legality of the new policy, 
perhaps anticipating challenges from priva- ' 
cy-minded students. It is generally under-
stood that one's likeness is the property of 
whomever takes the photograph, and so the 
university has the right to use these pho-
tographs as it wishes. 

However, when the potential for unin-
tended negative repercussions runs high and 
carries uch high costs, alternatives must be 
considered. 

While some students dislike the feeling of 
being lost in the crowd and would be pleased 
to have their professors know their names, 
others came to UCSD precisely because 
they treasure anonymity and the freedom it 
affords. T hei r preference to remain anony-
mous should be resp,ected. 
. The A.S. Councl} is considering provid-
mg ~tudents the optlon to remove their pho-
tos from StudentLink. This option is a sen-
sible possibility in that it allows students 
who are uncomfortable with the idea of fac-
u.lty and staff having access to their images 
Vla the Internet to avoid it, while it still pro-
vides a chance for other students to let pro-
fessors personalize their academic experi-

The university must work hard to make 
sure that students have the option to tailor 
their educational experience to _suit their 
goals and comfort levels and allow those 
who want the personal attention and famil-

iari~ c~aracteris~c of a small college to have 
their wI~h as readIly as can those looking for

OPINION 

"YES DOCTOR, I BELIEVE IT IS A CASE OF ANTHRAX. " 
Pat leung/Guardian 

United Nations needs preeminent 
position on world stage 

Organization can do more than issue condemnations 
By MAnHEW E. CROW 
Contributing Writer 

In his inaugural address, President 
john F. Kennedy sa id , "To that world 
assembly of sovereign states, the United 
Nations, our last, best hope in an age 
when the instruments of war have far out-
paced the instruments of peace, we renew 
our pledge of support, to prevent it from 
becoming merely a forum for invective, 
to strengthen its shield of the new and the 
weak, and to enlarge the area in which its 
writ may run." 

When Kennedy said these words, he 
was not merely invoking a far-off dream 
that had no chance of becoming reali -
ty. Rather, he was attempting to instill in 
the American people a notion that peace 
could be successful ly pursued only on the 
world stage, in communication with all 
the nations of the world: the strong and 
the weak. 

However, widespread distrust of glob-
al alliances has always been a natural ten-
dency of Americans, and many Americans 
were fair in thei r criticism of the United 
Nations for being merely a forum for 
invective. 

In this age of international terrorism 
and uncertain wars against uncertain ene-
mies, it is time that the efforts Kennedy 
once unde~took be redoubled by the cur-
rent administration. Not only should 
America increase its use of the United 
Nations as means of communication and 
diplomacy, but it should encourage other 
nations to do the same to strengthen the 
U.N. General Assembly\; power to inter-
vene and to influence. ' 

Of course, as mentioned above, the 
United Nations of the early 21st century 
is far from perfect. The General 
Assembly accomplishes little in the way 
of actual progress on the issues that 
plague society. In fact, about the only 
things the Assembly or the Office of the 
Secretary General accomplish are official 
condelTUlations of various situations and 
events. 

The recent terrorist attacks on U.S. 
soil serve as a perfect example of an event 
that the United Nations condemns, while 
doing little subsequently to maIce sure 
something similar will never happen again. 

The Se~urity Council and the other 
departments of the United Nations are 
highly bureaucratic and inefficient. They 
largely serve as smoke-filled rooms for 
the major players in world politics. Such 
organizations have the potential to 
become effective means of progress in 
international matters if they can stream-
line communication and increase their 
authority over international activity. 

Reforms are needed if the United 
Nations is to accomplish and succeed in 
its true mission: to facilitate a world with-
out war. However, before we can possibly 
dream such things for the future, we need 

It was this inability of the 
United Nations to side with 
the United States that led 

many Americans to 
distrust international 

organizations. We 
understandably have a 

natural instinct not to trust 
foreign countries with the 

lives of our troops, since 
any U.N. or Nato forces are 

made up of mostly 
Americans. 

to understand the history of this imper-
fect but grand orpnization. 

The idea of an in~tional organiza-
tion of states came about during the 
course of World War I, when President 
Woodrow Wilson, in an effort to justify 
the slaughter of American troops in 
Europe, claimed that the war was being 
fought to make the wodd safe for democ-
racy. He suggested that the outcome of 
the war should bring about a League of 
Nations, which would monitor interna-
tional affairs and operate under a collec-
tive defense clause. However, the treaty 
of the Leape of Nations WIS not 
apprcwed by the U.S. Senate, and 
Americ:ul membership in this early 01',.-
nizatiOl'l was blocked. 

Things remained as such until the end 
of World War II , when President 
Franklin D. Roosevell stated that one of 
his primary goals was the establishment 
of an international general assembly. This 
became the United Nations during the 
Truman administration. 

Without a doubt, the most explosive 
issue the United Nations had to deal with 
at its outset was the invention of the 
atomic bomb and the growing conflict 
between the Western allies, who separat-
ed to fonn the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the Soviet Union. The 
U.N . General Assembly served as a polit-
ical arena in which the battles of the Cold 
War were fought. . 

Each side tried to convince the rest of 
the world's delegates that it was right, 
that the other side was composed of 
either capitalist pigs or communist 
tyrants. Despite the fact that the United 
Nations sent troops into Korea to fight 
the spread of communism in Southeast 
Asia, in general it remained neutral in the 
Cold War. 

It was this neutrality, this inabi li ty of 
the United Nations to side with the 
United States, that led many Americans 
to distrust international organizations. 
We understandably have a natural 

. instinct not to trust foreign countries 
with the lives of our troops, since any 
UN. or NATO forces are made up of 
mostly Americans. 

As the Cold War dragged on, 
Americans gradually began to lose faith 
in the United Nations and instead turned 
inward for solutions to international 
problems. 

The Korean War, for example. was 
fought by a U.N. military force that 
included many Americans. The war in 
Vietnam was based completely on 
American unilateral foreign policy, con-
ducted with absolute disregard for the 
~ourt of world or national public opin-
Ion. 

lt was this sort of action that Kennedy 
sought to prevent when he called for 
renewed support of the United Nations 
and its efforts to keep the 
peace. Unfortunately, when Kennedy _

Editor: 
I wish you would keep your 

puerile ppinions to yourselves. Your 
ideas are so poorly t;hought out that 
it is an embarrassment to me to real-
ize that you attend the same univer-
si ty that I do. As long as you keep 
your mouths shut, the rest of uS can 
only guess at how stupid you are. 

Some people at this school are 
passionate about chemisoy. Others 
are passionate about studying for-
eign cululres. The thing I feel pas-
SIOnately about is ensuring that the 
rtghts guaranteed to every American 
citizen by the Bill of Rights are 
maintained and exercised. That's the 
reason that it is hard not to laugh 
when the UCSD Retardian editori -
alizes on how Tht Koala is somehow 
misusing the freedom of the press. 
Ha. II reminds me of the time a 6-
year-old girl approached me and 
called me a "poopy-head ." 
Lnmguing, but hardly anything that 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Criticism jeopardizes freedom of speech 
Koala editor responds to allegations of racist content 
is going to make me lose sleep. In 
hopes of exposing the UCSD stu-
dent body to a glimpse of some of 
the inner workings of The Koala, I'm 
going to take this opportunity to 
respond to the characterization of 
Thr Koala as a platform for racism. 

First of all, we do not write the 
personals. I want to invi te all stu-
dents to come by our office and see 
if I cannot immediately produce 
dozens of sUldent personals written 
in the past three weeks, either 
paper slips we collect through bags 
on campus located at Earl's Place, 
The Pub, Plaza Cafe and outside 
our office or through our e-mail 
account, ptrsonalS@thtkoala.org. 
T he Personals page is our best 
attempt to allow the average 
UCSD student to speak his/her 
mind in print to the rest of the stu-
dent body. The Senior Staff of Tbf 
Koala decide to publish personals 
based not on whether we or the rest 
of the student body agree with what 
the personals say, but rather if we 
feel they represent a student voice. 

obody has the right to tell me 
not to print the opinions of UCSD 
students in a paper that they fund. 
To the extent that any student dis-
agrees with the message of a per-
sonal and is interested in publicly 
responding, allow me to suggest 
that such students will have a diffi -
cult time tinding a platform that is 
as widely \~ewed and as open to the 
average stude nt as Tlu KOlila's 
Personals page. 

Secondly, there has been some 
controversy over the Chikes joke. I 
wrote that joke myself and I am a 
Kike. That's right. I'm Jewish. How 
I refer to my own people houJd not 
be an issue that offends the Gllardian 
or anyone else. To any other jews 
who are still dissatisfied with this 

response: Lighten up. It was a joke, 
ee? A joke? I think it's really sad to 

see people so uptight that they can't 
even laugh at themselves. If you can't 
laugh at yourself, you have no right 
to laugh at others and you certainly 
have no business reading Tilt Koala. 

According to the last A.S. elec-
tion, 67 percent of the voting stu-
dent body reads Tht Koala. We gOt 

'Obviously, hate exists 
at UCSD. Does anyone 

actually think that 
trying to make The 
Koala censor these 

student opinions will 
do anything to make 

these people feel 
different?' 

-Georqe Lee LIddle, III 
Editor in Chief. The Koala 

more votes than any other publica-
tion, measure or candidate (even 
unopposed candidates) on the entire 
ballot. Apparently, there is a substan-
tial audience for the material we are 
printing. This indicates to me that 
rather than being some sort of 
extremist publication, we are the 
most centrist and widely appealing 
student publication at UCSD. 

Thirdly, I want to address the 
various student organizations that 
have come out and condemned The 
Koala for racism. You obviousl y 
missed one of the main points of 
the "Forum on the Greek System" 
article. It is my opinion, and 1 don't 
know how many other people agree 

with me, that student organizations 
that recruit their membership 
exclusively from students of a cer-
tain ethnic background are con-
tributing to racism much more 
than the printing of a few lines of a 
student's opinion. These organiza-
tions are designed to create a SOCial 
structure built entirely for tile iso-
lation of a specific ethnic group 
from the rest of the student body 
of UCSD. They are singli ng tlmn-
sthm out from the rest of the 
UCSD community and forming a 
"jewish community" and dozens of 
splintered Asian communities at 
UCSD . 

Furthermore, when these orga-
nizations allow The Koala to print 
material that makes fun of white 
people, fat people, handicapped 
people, etc. and only take action 
when members of a particular eth-
nic group are made fun of in Tilt 
Koala, I call that racism, straight out 
of Wtbsters Dictionary. These racist 
organizations offend me and the 
idea that they have balls to accuse 
me of racism is truly astonishing. 

I want to wrap this up with a lit-
tle thought fo r all of those people 
who think that hate speech should 
not be published with student 
funds . Are you suggesting that free 
speech can exist without hate 
speech? Mind if I ask how? What 
they really want is for Tht Koala to 
make its offensive material less 
offensive to the over-represented 
"minority" groups on campus, but 
still make fun of retards, Jesus, 
Revelle and other acceptable tar-
gets of ridicule. 

Obviously, hate exists at UCSD. 
Does anyone actually think that 
trying to make The Koala censor 
these student opinions will do any-
thing to make these people feel dif-

ferent? Your proposal to stymie free 
speech on campus will only lap a 
Band-Aid on continued ignorance, 
encourage hateful people to feel 
angry and disenfranchised and pro-
vide an easy way to avoid dealing 
with race issues on real terms. ThiS 
is not the solution to curing hate at 
UCSD. The same people who 
claim to want to bring everyone 
together into the UCSD communi -
ty with kisses and love also want to 
exclude people whose beliefs they 
deem "ha teful. " 

Who gets to decide? If I decide 
that every word ever printed by any 
student paper at UCSD deeply 
offends me and my religious and 
ethnic heritage does that mean that 
all campus publications are now 
printing hate speech and should be 
shut down?'" Or better yet, how 
about the cartoon ti,e GlIardian put 
right next to its editorial critici zing 
Tbt KOllla for being a platfo rm fo r 
hatred that eems to advocate chil-
dren shooting their classmates for 
being bullies? What's the excuse for 
that? It sure as hell wasn't funny. 

Under the guise of being fight -
ers for students who are hurt bv 
Tilt Koala, Tbt UCSD GlIal'd,all and 
anyone else who is criticizing my 
editorial decisions is contn buting 
to the weakening of every 
American 's inalienable nght~ to J 
free press, to free expre~sion JIlU to 
free speech. That is how the Bill of 
Rights actually works. That IS what 
our forefathers killed and died for, 
and I welcome anyone at this 
school, GlIardian staffers included, 
to oy to StOP TIlt Koala from con-
tinuing to be heard. 

On behalf of The Koala : Blow 
me.

killed, so wa legitimate hope for 
the United ations to carry on an 
active role in world affairs in his 
time. 

Since the end of the Vietnam 
War, the United ations has 
slowly sunk into obscurity. Today, 
the opinion of the General 
Assembly of the United Nations 
counts for litde ~n any major for-
eign policy decision. Would 
President George W. Bush StOP 
the sanctions on Cuba or make 
some other change in policy if the 
United Nations recommended it 
and if the recommendation was 
sound? Chances are, he or any 
other American official would 
hardly consider such a recommen-
dation worth his time. 

Such a unilateral !,nindset pre-
vents the United ations from 
achieving its full potential, and 
that is why today the United 
Nations' mission remains a dream 
and not a reality. 

However, in the spirit of d1e 
founding of the United Nations, 
there is always hope. The great 
assembly of states now faces a 
crossroads: on one path, it can 
become an effective congress of 
the world, which works for the 
rights of the Third World and for 
peace among all nations; or it can 
continue on its present course and 
become a place where powerful 
nations seek to gain trade and mil-
itary advantages over one another, 
and poor nations sink further into 
poverty as a result.

that one deparonent does not cre-
ate a document to condemn the 
effects of corporate globalization 
while another seeks to s(.'Cure trad-
ing rights for American and 
Chinese companies in Zaire. 

Each section of the Umted 
Nations needs to be streamlined 
so that communication between 
nations, departments and olher 
interest groups becomes qUicker 
and more efficient. 

Finally, the leadership of the 
United Nations must shed its 
timid role in international con-
nicts and forget about playing po l-
itics with the major powers. \Vhen 
something seen1S unJust, that si tu -
ation should be addressed by the 

. entire body of the United Nations 
and voiced to the rest of the 
world, no matter who is angered 
by such honest policy. 

As with any great change in 
society, true change must come in 
the minds of the people, nor the 
policies of leaders. Racism did nor 
stop with the Civil Rights Act, and 
isolationism will not StOP with the 
strengthening of the United 
Nations. Americans must come to 
perceive themselves as citizens of 
the world, JUSt as they arc citizens 
of this country. 

People must come to view the 
United Nations as a place where 
the truth is spoken no matter 
whom it angers and where ju tice 
for all is sought all the time. 

Furthermore, when the truth is 
spoken, it must be acted upon. 
Declarations of human rights 
don'r do much to improve human 
rights. The United ations needs 
to be given the power to take real 
action against injustice, be that 
action political or military. 

Www.ulsdguardian.org 

For the former to occur, major 
refonns must take place within and 
outside the halls of the General 
Assembly. The different divisions 
of the United Nations must come 
under one general authority, so 

In the end, the American goal, 
with regard to the United 
Nations, is the same one that 
Kennedy declared 41 years ago: to 
strengthen its shield of the new 
and the weak, and to increase the 
area in which its writ may run.

By LAUREN POPP 
Contributing Writer 

Rarely does a choreograph-er possess the ability to create a serious, dramatic 
piece as effectively as a comical 
spoof, yet Sean Curran is one of 
those exceptional artists. 

His premiere at Mandeville 
Auditorium presented a varied bill 
of four works ranging in theme 
and content from an almost cere-
monial, Eastern-inspired piece, to 
an eclectic hodgepodge of classi-
cal ballet, to modern and tradi -
tional Irish step dancing, clearly 
commenting on Curran's diverse 
background. The common 
denominator between all four 
works is Curran's intensity of 
emotion and wit, echoed by each 
of his dancers. 

The audience was immediate-
ly engaged by the rhythmic 
drumming audible prior to the 
opening of Curran's first offer-
ing. Its first glimpse of the com-
pany was a visually stunning 
assemblage of vibra ntly hued 
costumes contra ted against sta rk 
black-and-white striped flooring. 

T he effect of this image was 
intensified by the use of harsh 

white lighting that gave a clean, 
simplified feeling to the piece 
titled " Abstract Concrete." This 
sense of pure, clean lines is con-
tinued through Curran's chore-
ography. 

Curran uses a linear theme 
throughout to create sudden, 
ordered patterns at the most 
chaotic moments of dancing. 
The dancers alternate parmers 
frequently, creating a sense of 
constant flux , altering relation-
ships and playful interactions. 
The chaotic moments of the 
piece are resolved by the prima-
ry couple's repetition of the same 
lyrical pas de deux at the begin-
ning and end of the piece. This 
repetition also provides a cyclical 
feelil)g to the dance. 

Curran presented a more 
tecent work next that hinted at 
themes of sexuality and coming to 
terms with one's personal idiosyn-
crasies. "Metal Garden" is diviJed 
by a beautiful interlude with three 
couples moving methodically 
through each other's arms. 
Curran repeatedly made odd 
entrances and exits during this 
section carrying gardening sup-
plies. Such pointed hints at Ius 
meaning were Curran's way of

strikes a pose for the camera. 

challenging members of his audi -
ence to question thei r own inter-
pretation of the piece. 

The most technically impres-
sive and stylistica lly varied of the 
four works was Curran's 
acclaimed "Symbolic Logic," a 
ritualistic piece that reveals the 
wide range of Curran's choreo-
graphic influences, from classical 
Indian dance to martial arts. Each 

dancer stood alone at the begin-
ning of the piece repeating con-
trolled, ornamented ann move-
ments - seemingly lost in a sclf-
reflective, spiritual experience. 

Curran shows a great sensitiv-
ity for creating a unified theme in 
"Logic" by using ci rcular 
imagery on the fl oor and cos-

UAG: 
New art showcase features 
Irish roots 
Continued from page 9 

1980s. 
However, Taaffe was unable 

to attend his own exhibition 
because of the terrorist attacks 
on the East Coast. His colleague 
and friend, Raymond Foye, gave 
the lecture. 

Foye informed the audience, 
"I've never given a lecture 
before - this is done on a very 
impromptu basis." 

F oye addressed the various 
themes of Taaffe's paintings. 

"The lonely moment in a stu-
dio where one faces either a 
blank page as a poet or a blank 
canvas as a painter and suddenly 
it's real and what do you do with 
that?" Foye said. 

He spoke of the artist trying 
to produce upon the canvas "the 
nature of the poetic image, fam-
ilies of forms, a sense of mystery 
and trance." He said that Taaffe 
believes that "painting is a spiri-
tual opening to another place." 

"The rhythm or music, the 
space in between the notes, a 
chance operation, the creation 
of a system that moves from 
simplicity to complexity, the 
thinking eye," was what Taaffe 
wanted to create, according to 
Foye. 

Taaffe was quoted as saying, 
"Nature is the great teacher of 
art." 

In a private interview, after 
being asked about his art and 
what it meant to him, Taaffe 
said, "Every cell has to have an 
energy of its own." Therein lies 
the more inclusive, loving part 
of the story, and then there must 
"be a ruthlessness." 

It was Taaffe's goal "not to be 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18,2001 

reductionist, but to be as inclu -
sive as possible." He saw paint-
ing as "a form of thought and 
also as a form of meditati on." 

The exhibit itself featured 
radiant works of art with 
starfish, cobras, pl ants and 
diatoms, stripes and spots, and 
shapes utterly without tangible 
form that held the eye for what 
seemed like an eterni ty. 

In the center of the exhibit 
was a giant painted quote from 
Taafe that explains it all : "My 
roots are from Ireland, and I 
suppose a subtext to my work 
must relate to these. Celtic 
shamanistic tradition s. The work 
is also about movement or how 
we see in a conStar.t series of 
glimpses. What do I expect it to 
be like as a physi ';al encounter? I 
think the best thing one can 
hope for is to be able to enter 
into another world ." 

The best explanation of 
Phillip Taaffe's work that was 
heard all evening was 
from Peter Prato, a literature 
major at UCSD. Answering ro 
the idea that "perhaps one does 
need a preoccupation with death 
to paint," his immediate 
reply was "no, one needs a pre-
occupation with life to paint, and 
an understanding of death." 

The exhibit will be running 
now through Saturday, Dec. 8. 
The University Art Gallery is 
located at the west end of 
Mandeville Center on the 
UCSD campus. Gallery hours 
are Tuesday through Saturday, 
from II a.m. to 4 p.m. Guided

Q&A Interview with an Ant 
Alien Ant Farm drummer talks about Fall Fest 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Staff Writer 

A lien Ant Farm was able to entertain a packed house at this year's FallFest with its hit single. "Smooth CriminaL" 
Lindsay Boyd of The UCSD Guardian was 
able to catch up with the drummer, Mike 
Cosgrove. 

LB: So how did you guys like FallFest? 
MC: It was cool. It was a lot of fun. I was 
surprised that that many people were there. 
San Diego was a difficult place for us. We 
were out there and we did shows but we 
never really broke into there. We.had done 
some shows at 'Canes and all that, so it was 
a really good feeling to come in and have 
such a good show there. 

LB: So where on the road is the band now? 
MC: We're actually in Boise; we're taking the 
day off between Vancouver and Denver. !r's 
pretty mellow. l've only been here once. We 
played the Warped Tour here and we had 
cool show. It was fun. We're about to go run 
around the. mall and see what it has to offer. 

LB: So is this your first headlining tour? 
MC: Yeah. We've been doing a whole bunch 
of support. We did support for Linkin Park 
and Tap Root, Orgy, Papa Roach and Snap 
Case. Its a lot of fun. We got a [support] 
band called Dredg. 

LB: What is different between touring now 
and touring when you guys first started out? 
MC: Well, we really didn't tour four year 

ago. We did some smaller tours. We did one 
like two years ago in Europe. But now we're 
taken care of a little bit bener. Everything we 
were doing before was really ghetto, just vans 
and shit ... now we get cool meal tickets. 

LB: So Alien Ant Fann played the infa-
mous Reading Festival this past summer. 
How was that? 
MC: It was really cool. Those festivals like 
Reading, Leeds, Gig on the Green in 
Scotland are all really big. It was cool we got 
to play with a bunch of cool bands and see 
how the English do it ... The fans over there, 
they just kind of receive you bener. 
LB: So has the rock world been affected 
by the recent bombings in Afghanistan? 
Does that affect you out on the road at 
all? 
MC: Yeah, it's affected a lot of things. 
There's a lot of song titles that are too much 
for these quote-sensitive times. I'm sure 
"Drowning Pool With Bodies at the Floor" 
isn't doing too well right now. 

LB: What would you say is the highlight 
of your band's rise to fame so far? 
MC: Seeing our families proud. I don't 
know, I would say just meeting a lot of dif-
ferent heroes. I got to meet Danny Carey, 
he's the drummer for Tool and 3 II . We got 
to play with on the Warped Tour and we 
were big fans of them and now we're good 
friends. That kind of stuff. You go from 
being a kid , totally being a fan, wondering

Five for Five is not a bad deal 
UCSD Theatre and Dance gives students five shows for $5 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Staff Writer 

Five is the goal. Reach deep into your pocket and feel inside for any 100 e change. Unfurl your wallet and pull out 
some bills. When the five dollars are in your 
palm, you also have a chance to see five li ve 
UCSD Theatre and Dance productions 
throughout the 2001-02 season. 

Theatre and Dance Chair Walton Jones 
developed the Five f0T Five program three 
y.ears ago. The program enables UCSD ml-
dents to attend five productions for $5, 
which is $23 off the normal student price. 

For a dollar a night, students will be on 
their way to becoming regular theater-
goers, according to Promotions Manager 
Carolyn Passeneau. 

"Our theater is thought provoking, cut-
ting edge theater," Passeneau said. "We arc 
not fluff. The productions we put on are 
very academic." . 

She attributes the Five for Five program 
to th~ department's passion for wanting to 
develop students in ways that only theater 
can. Theater is also a way for the "commu-
nity to come together and have theater con-
tribute to a national healing process," to 
Passeneau said. 

"Life's A Dream" will be students' first 
opportunity to see a playas part of Five for 
Five. Students can catch this production of a 
Spanish Golden Age classic with a contem-

Curran: 
Modem dance entertains with a 
sense of humor 
Continued from pap 9 
tumes, alluding to ideas of cycles of life and 
death. 

Dancer Heather Waldon-Arnold, who 
stood out throughout the entire perfor-
mance, was particularly exquisite in this 
piece. Her superior ballet technique adds a 
lyricism and ease to her movements that the 
other dancers lack. 

Curran 's choice of music in the vocals of 
Sheila Chandra adds to the religious tone of 
the piece, often evoking images of a place of 
spiritual worship. 

For Ius final piece, Curran references his 
earliest training in Irish step dancing while 
depicting the drastic differences in technique 
from classical ballet. The result is a hilarious 
marriage of what Curran calls "Traditional 

porary pop twist on a chance meeting of a 
prince and abandoned women. Wrinen by 
Pedro Calderon de la Barca and directed by 
Suzanne Agins, it will be performed in the 
Mandell Weiss Forum from Nov. 15 
through Nov. 24. 

Other shows are "The Duchess Malfi," 
"An Evening of Dance," "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" and a winter guest artists' 
event that will be shown throughout the 

• year. 
The shows were chosen so UCSD could 

attend the theater and see an exciting pro-
duction that will have students coming back 
for more. 

"You get to see new things in our depart-
ment," Passeneau said. "We take risks and 
are very concerned with what is good the-
ater." 

Purchase the tick~ts at Galbraith Hall, rm. 
202 . Tickets are available from 8 a.m. to 12 
p.m. and I p.m. to 4 p.m. until Oct. 22. Each 
year the program grows, and the deparonent 
is willing to accommodate those who want to 
buy tickets and will stay lace if a line develops, 
but Passeneau advises getting tickets early. 

"We anticipate about 1,000 people to 
take part in this," she said. "But the depart-
ment wants everyone on this campus to be 
involved in this exciting season." 

Further information about dates, sched-
ules and other events and shows can be found 
at the Theatre and Dance Department's Web 
page at http://,htlltTt.ucrd.tdll. 

Methods" and "Postmodern Techniques," in 
his work "Folk Dance for the Future." 

Curran pokes fun at the state of Irish step 
dancing today, mocking the self-titled "Lord 
of the Dance," Michael Flatley. Heather 
Waldon-Arnold improvised a comical solo 
of the same nature, followed later by a con-
trasting ballet section, performed with the 
same virtuosity she demonstrated through-
out the show. 

As all die dancers joined together on stage 
for their finale, they offered their untrained 
imitation of step dancing to the delight of the 
audience. To see "Folk Dances" is to gain a 
be.tter understanding not only of where 
Curran began, but of how successfully he has 
used all of his training to create a unique style 
all his own through humor and a sincere love 
of dance of all ki nds. 

Sean Curran~ work may run the gamut of 
choreographic styles, but regardless of the 
type of dance he uses as his medium, his work 
consistendy possesses a confidence that comes 
from never taking himself too seriously.

Macy Gray 
The Id 

Epic 

**** 
" Id: thc part of the psy-

che that is the source of 
IJ1stinctual impulses and 
demands for satisfaction." 
So reads the inside cover of 
Alacy Gray's sophomore 
album, ''The Id." And it's 
lrue - her Impulsive musIc 
demands satisfaction. 

When Gray's debut 
album, "On the Way Life 
1;," was first released in 
1999, her virtual anonymi-
ty became shan-lived once 
~ongs like "I ' Iry" hil tht! 
airwaves. She refreshed US 
with multidimensional 
melodies and a dynamic 
presencc. Il er blend of 
sou l, R&B, funk and hip-
hop set her apart from her 
conremporanes. 

While "The Id" main-
rain much of Grays unique 
style and subject matter, this 
time around Gray's out-

landi,h personality shines 
through even brighter than 
before. "The Id" is about 
the psyche of Gray.

of "Sexual Revolution" is a 
funk,), experimentation with 
an updated disco pulse dlat 
will soon be heard on dance 
floors . 

The most astonishing 
aspect of the album, howev-
er, is the song "Oblivion," 
which sOlUlds as if il was 
ri pped from the score of 
"Fiddler on the Roof. " 

Disper ed du-ough the 
oddities of Gray's album are 
the slow beats and riveting 
sounds of trumpets that 
accompany her wherever 
she goes. "Sweet Baby" is 
the epitome of Macy Grays 
talents and the piece most 
reminiscent of her debut 
album. It 's an added plus

Yes, it's rrue that Gray 
wore pink rain boots to the

But regardless of her

ecccnrricities, "The Id" is it.

Tori Amos didn 't thank 

the faeries 111 the liner 
notes to her new album, 
"Strange Little Girls." 

On her other releases, 
her thanks have, of course, 
gone out to her band, her 
friends or her family. fuld 
she has always thanked 
"the faeries." 

She has intimated that 
the faeries inspire her song 
writing. And so, although 
it was jarring to have them 
missing, the faeries have 
little place on "Strange 
Little Girls" - Amos did-
n't write a single song on 
the album. 

Instead, the 12 rracks 
are all songs written by men 
- Eminem, Lou Reed, 
Tom Waits, Neil Young and 
the Beades among them. In 
her ' characteristically eso-
teric style, she explains that 

• 

reviews 
she performed the songs as 
stories told from dIe per-
spective of women who 
"approached Iher] and said, 
' I have a point of \~ew on 
this song that you Illay want 
to know, that may change 
how you hear its meaning.'" 

C hoosi ng standout 
lracks is nearly impossi-
ble, but a few lead the 
pack. 

With samples from 
politicians, pundits and a 
journalist reporting on 
John Lennon's murder, 
ful10S turns Lennon and 
McCartney's "Happiness Is 
a Warm Gun" into a rrippy 
meditation on the right to 
bear arms. 

But the most haunting 
piece is her flip-side take 
on Emincm's "'97 Bonnie 
and Clyde." She chants the 
gruesome murder-fantasy 
like a bedtime story, as if 
she is the mother whose 
body is pitched into a lake 

.by her ex-husband and 
their baby daughter. 

Schizophrenia? Maybe. 
But as varied as the songs 
are individually, the album 
a a whole achieves a unity 
of theme and mood not 
seen sll1ce "Boys for Pele" 
and "Under the Pink." 
The entire album pulses 
with an energy that is 
unapologetically female -
and unquestionably Tori.

*** 
For those who are tired 

of being exposed to the 
explosion of the rap/tech-
no/rocle combos and mel -
lowed-out pop alternative, 
Halfcocked's major label 
debut album, "The Last 
Star," is here to feed your 
ears - a fresh, artfully har-
mOI11C blend of meta l, 
punk and good old 1970s 
hard rock, laden with sur-
prisingly smooth melodic 
pop sensibilities. 

Their name is a Boston 
expression that means 
"slighdy drunk," which is 
quite apt for describing 
their frenetic style. 

The members consist of 
two men and three women, 
including drummer 
Charlee Johnsson, who 
founded the band, and lead 
singer Sarah Reitkopp, 
whose amazing rock god-

"I Lied" Immediate ly 
draws you in wnh liS Sim-
ple yet extremely catchy 
guitar riffs and an inten 'c 
chorus featuring fierce 
melodic bursts that stop 
intelligently" shorr of the 
typical harsh screaming. It 
will have you nodding, if 
not outright head-banging, 
and belting out "I lied," in 
no time. 

"Always" is less intense, 
but has the same successful 
ingredients of amazing 
guitar work coupled with a 
very catchy melodic chorus 
and strong lyrics. "Thanks 
for the Ride" is a quirky 
upbeat ong about a vibra-
tor, and there is a short but 
impressive electric guitar 
solo at the end. 

The rest of the songs, 
wi th the exception of 
"Drive Away" and "GJiner," 
get repetitive and the inten-
sity can get tiring. The rep-
etition of these songs is mit-
igated by their short 
lengths. Johnsson explains, 
"Basically, we malee music 
for people with Attention 
Deficit Disorder and we're 
eager to accept blame for 
attempting to resurrect the 
gloty days of arena rock." 
Blame? I think not.

Prison escape proves to 
be an ordinary affair 
Robert Redford and James Gandolfini duel 
against each other in 'The Last Castle' 
By MARA EVANS 
Contributing Writer . 

Ina castle there is a division of roles: The good guys stay on the inside and the bad guys stay 
on the outside. But what happens 
when the good guys are trying to 
escape the bad guys and they're 
both on the inside? You wind up 
with "The Last Castle," starring 
Rebert Redford and James 
Gandolfini . 

Redford plays General Irwin, a 
career army man who is sentenced 
to 10 years in military prison on the 
eve of his retirement. Irwin arrives 
at "the Castle" prepared to serve 
his sentence quietly, but upon 
arrival, he is confronted by the 
harsh ru le of prison warden 
Colonel Winter (Gandolfini) . 

At first, Redford is skeptical 
about the other prisoners' com-
plaints dlat the brutality they live 
wi th goes far beyond the norm of 
other maximum-security establish-
ments. However, after a few horri -
ble acts of corporal punishment and 
a miss-aimed rubber bullet, 
Redford changes his mind and 
decides to lead his fellow inmates' 
crusade to oust Gandolfini. 
Besides, what else has he got to do' 

Redford is well-cast as the com-
manding Irwin , and not just 
because of his intense military pres-
ence. There is no one else in dle 
cast that holds the same Hollywood 
stature as Redford - stature that 
seems necessary to play the general. 
As a result, due focus is not given to 

Film 
REVIEW 

the rest of the cast. 
Sadly, Gandoltini i misclirected 

as the tyrannical Winter. ful actor 
with amazing capabilities, 
Gandolfini lacks dle fluid delivery 
that would have made Winter a 
true te rror. Instead, he appears 
uncomfortable in his military uni-
fo rm and resorts to hand gestures 
that are reminiscent of a Tony 
Soprano persona. 

Hidden behind the shadow of 
Redford and Gandolfini is a talent-
ed supporting cast. C lifton Coll ins 
Jr. plays the mentally challenged 
Aguilar, a character whose develop-
ment greatly enhances the film. 
Similarly, Delroy Lindo's character, 
the feisty General Wheeler, pro-
vides the film with a much needed 
a tti tude check. 

Filmed in the historic Tennessee 
State Penitentiary, "The Last 
Castle" visually captures the rigid 
confinement of the prison and the 
subsequent robbery of self-wortll 
that occurs within its walls. 
Director Rod Lurie does an excel-
lent job contrasting the serenity of 
Winter's office, complete with c1.ls-
sical music, with the chaos of the 
prison yard. 

Despite the film 's flaws, the 
scenes of the prisoners' take-over

NHello, my name is Brandon Foster, a 2nd year 
student at Warren. I realized I needed to start hunting 
around for a place to live, so I gave TOBIN a call. In 
short, Tobin hooked me up! After I had found a place 
that I liked, he fought off other bidders until the place 
was ours. Tobin helped me every step of the way. He 
came to my apartment and took the forms and 
delivered them to the appropriate places for me. So 
now I have this property, but I won't even need it 
until next year- not a problem! Tobin found renters 
immedia tely. The condo will be paying for itself until 
I am ready to move in. He is simply the best!N

turns into one giant game of cap-

the prisoners is particularly enter-
taining, as are the impacts of a few 
expertly-aimed boulders. 

T he concept of "The Last

the execution is nothing new. The 
residual effect is something much 
akin to a childhood and castle: It 'll

of the record cycle to maybe where 
it would carry us over to the next

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2001 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Tournament: 
Tritons strong against 
weeker competition 
Continued from page 20 
tl nd freshman J onathan I Iopkins 
both contributed one goal to the 
victory. 

The Tri tons were ready to go 
Sunday. In thei r first game, they 
played 19th-ranked Cal Baptist, a 
team they had already faced earlier 
this yea r and easily dispatched. T he 
TritOns started quickly, outscoring 
Cal Baptist 5-2 in the first quarter. 

In the second and third quar-
ters, the teams alternated 4-3 scor-
ing, ending the third period 12-9 in 
UCSD 's favor. The Tri tons ended 
any hope for the Lancers by scor-
in,g four goals in the fourth quarter 
while allowing only one. Eight 
players scored during the game, 
most notably Djapic, who scored 
five goals, and Jonathan Samuels, 
who scored three. 

In their final game of the tour-
nament, UCSD found themselves 
squaring off against No. 8-ranked 
UC Santa Barbara. Official rank-

ings predicted that this would be a 
close game. The TritOns, however, 
dominated in what was to be a 
remarka bly one-sided display. 

erting the rempo, UCSD out-
matched UCSB 3-1 in the first 
quarter. T he second quarter was 
even more lopsided when th e 
Tritons pounded the Gauchos 5- 1. 
By the end of the first half, UCS D 
wenr into the locker room with a 
commandi ng 8-2 lead. T he only 
other goal of the game was scored 
in the third quarter by the Tritons. 
In the end, UCS D showed its dom-
inance over UCSB, demolishing 
the Gauchos 9-2. 

Grea t defense and goaltending 
were key in this game. Samuels 
again turned in a solid !Jerfor-
mance, scoring a game-high three 
goals. Allan and Hopkins each had 
two goals in the game, while Djapic 
and Jendrusina each tOssed in one. 

After the loss on Saturday, the 
TritOns made the best of their situ-
ation and did what they had to do. 
The Tritons' record still stands at 
an impressive 14-2. They next take 
on the No. 6-ranked Long Beach

Senior volleyball player is honored 

Homecoming: 
Alumni games just a 
part of the big weekend

Besides coming to games, the

Buchanan. 
Though he jokes about his own 

athletic talent, there's no question 
that sport was a major part of 
Buchanan's srudent experience. 

"UCSD was great and every-
thing,but water polo was what 
made it memorable," he said. 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

UCSD's Ka thleen Hentz was 
named the California Collegiate 
.\ thklll' .\ "ucIJtiun\' player uf 
the week in women's volleyball 
for the week of Oct. 8 through 
Oct. 14. 

Hentz, a 5-1'00t- 10 middle 
hlocker from Los Angeles, is a 
senior on the Triton volleyball 
squad. he led UCSD to confer-
ence victories over Sonoma State 
and San Francisco State last 
weekcnu to earn the award. 

"[Hentz] played great for us 
last week," said Triton head vol-
leyball coach Duncan McFarland. 
"She was very consistent." 

In the match against the 
Sonoma Sl:ate Cossacks, she put

The A's had a pretty good 
chanl.:e, too. All they had to do 
was beat a Yankee team tha! was 
noticably weaker than the one 
that won the World Series last 
year. 

Then Monday came around 
and the A's picked up my sh'at-
tercd hopes and ground them into 
dust. 1'111 nO! even sure If what 
the}' did on Monday could be 
called baseball. If they had played 
a good game and lost, it would be 
different. But no, the A's shot 
themselves in the (oat Monday

ing and sloppy hitting. Hell , they 
didn't just shoot themselves in the

down a match-high 13 kills while 
hitting an amazing .522. She also 
added a team-high of 11 digs, twO 
service aces, two blocks and an 
assist in the three-game sweep. 
Against the San Francisco State 
Gators, she recorded a team-high 
six kills to go along with eight 
digs. She had no errors in the 
game. 

For the week, Hentz averaged 
3.8 kills per game and 3.8 digs per 
game to go along with a .405 hit-
ring percentage. 

McFarland said that Hentz has 
been a model of consistency. 

"[Hentz] has been steady for 
us all season," McFarland said. 
"She started very strong for us. 
She came into the year in great 
shape and has continued to work 
hard all year." 

foot and then ampul:ated their leg 
just below the knee. 

And so my baseball season 
ends the same way it does every 
year: I vow to never root for 

. another baseball team ever again 
and resign myself to watching 
another high-rolling bunch of 
mercenaries buy the World 
Series. 

Yet I know next year, when 
spring rolls around , I' ll be 
instantly hooked. I know I ,won't 
be able to resist the temptation of 
checking out how the Giants' 
spring training is going, how Jeff 
Kent looks this year, and whether 
Shawn Estes is finally going to 
have another good season. 

I'll think, "T don't know, this 
year could be the year, this year 
they could do it ." And my 12-year 
relationship with baseball will 
renew itself, as it does every 
spring after our four-month hia-
rus, and my spirit will once aga in 
rise and fa ll in tune with the 
Giants. 

He looks back fondly on his 
term as a Triton, calling it "a signif-
icant bonding experience." 
Teammates studied and partied 
together, and were movers . and 
shakers on campus when UCSD 
was still "pretty sleepy." 

He spoke reverently of former 
water polo coach and current 
Aquatics Program Director Denny 
Harper. 

"I got to see him from the first 
time he walked in the door," 
Buchanan said. 

Buchanan credits Harper with 
ushering in a new era of water polo 
forUCSD. 

"We didn't play high-caliber 
teams until · Denny," he said. 
"That got people to recognize 
that UCSD was a great water polo 
team." 

The team's talent and close 
friendships have led its members to 
keep playing and keep in touch. 
Reunions like homecoming are 
nothing new to Buchanan, who 
claimed, "Water polo guys have 
been having alumni games forev-
er." 

Up to 40 former Tritons are 
expected to participate in 
Sarurday's II a.m. face-off with the 
current UCSD team. 

But can the older players hold 
their own against the young ones? 

"No way," Buchanan said flatly. 
"The college guys are in top physi-
cal shape - they're faster and 
stronger [than the alumni] ." 

He went on to joke, "We'll get 
some ref ro make sure we get the 
ca lls so we feel good about our-
selves." 

After all , it's not about compe-
tition, but "an opporrunity to get 
in and hang out with [the colle-
giate players I," according to 

Dawn Lee was emphatic when 
asked what role her time spent on 
the women's soccer team played in 
her college experience. 

"It was all my experience," Lee 
said. 

Lee teaches physical education 
and health at University of San 
Diego High School, and she has 
attended homecoming every year 
since she graduated in 1994. 

Lee feels that homecoming has 
been "getting better and better 
every year" as the alumni pool gets 
bigger and more people come 
back. 

"It's great to meet the girls who 
are younger and let them see that 
we're still involved, and to let them 
know how we're all still friends," 
Lee said. 

This group of friends is involved 
through athletics - they still kick 
the ball around in a formal adult 
league - as well as important 
events of another sort. 

"We go to each others ' wed-
dings," she explained. 

Lee said 30 of her UCSD soccer 
friends will be involved in 
Sarurday's matchup against tough 
San Bernardino. 

Her memories of UCSD are 
dominated by athletic events and 
friendships with teammates. 

"That was what was really neat 
when I was there," Lee said. 
"You're out one for all and every-
one's !Jut there supporting each 
other." 

She looks forward to homecom-
ing for a similar reason: She loves 
that "all the sports are intermin-
gling" at the social events and in 
the stands. 

Grosse agrees. 
"It's important for ath letes to 

become a community," he said . "It 
builds family. It' not just a sense of 
tearns but of a program. Athletes 
get a sense that they're part of 
something that came before and 
will go on after."

SPORTS 20 

Alumni try to recapture that loving feeling 
Athletes return to compete, socialize and regain college experience , 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 
Senior Staff Writer 

"I would say that I was painfully aver-
age." 

o spoke UCSD alumnus Greg 
Buchanan, class of 1983, in describing 
his water polo skill - ot lack thereof. 
Yet Buchanan was there for the begin-
ning of the glory days of UCSD water 
polo and acknowledged that it was excit-
IIlg to h:,lp "put UCSD water polo on 
the map. 

That excitement per ists, despite the 
nearly 20 yea rs that separate 
Buchanan 's last season playing Triton 
water polo from his current job work-
ing for the city of San Diego in boating 
safety for Mission Bay. 

Buchanan still play . He will be in 
UCSD waters this weekend when nearly 
400 alunUli athletes will renin) to our 
ITIlsty mesa for UCSD's 2001 homecom-
ing. 

Saturday will find UCSD teeming 
with visitors - for Open House, certain-
ly, but also for a daylong celebration of 
the competitors that have made our ath-
letics program what it is today. 

Associate Athletics Director Ken 
Grosse explained that his department has 
brought alumni together for a day of 
sport every fall for the last seven years. 
1I0wever, the last three homecomings 
have been organized with the UCSD 

AlunUli Association to expand this all-
campus event into a get-together of 
grand proportions. 

Ten alumni games are scheduled for 
Saturday morning. But the real draw is 
more than the thrill of victory; it's the 
fun of seeing old friends and team-
mates. 

"There's a lot of camaraderie and a lot 
of friendships that have gone on for 
yea rs, especially in the athletics depart-
ment," said Tammy Traudt of the 
Alumni Office. 

As the office's program coordinator, 
"lraudt puts together the events that 
bring alumni back. She sa id an "enor-
mous number" of alumni athletes from 
every age group come to homecoming to 
participate in their respective sports. 

Grosse feels such reunions are impor-
tant because. they foster an "emotional 
commitment to the university." 

And there's the beer garden, which 
aiunUl3 Carol Criswell laughingly cited 
as something she's looking forward to. 

Criswell knows a little about the 
"family" of UCSD athletics. She played 
volleyball from 1984 to 1987, a period 
that encompassed the three years 
women's volleyball won national titles. 
Her husband w~s also a Triton volleyball 
player. ow they bring their three chil-
dren to UCSD games ' and events regu-
larly. 

"The kids love to go," she said. 

"[Homecoming) is a great family day, 
actually: So many of our friends will be 
there." 

Indeed, Criswell's 10 closest friends 
are either people from volleyball or peo-
ple she met through teammates . .she said 
she still runs into people who recognize 
her from UCSD, and that it's "great to 
reconnect" with her friends from the 
good old days. 

While she admitted that some parts 
of college were hard for her, Criswell's 
descriptions of the sporting atmos-
phere while she was a student are 
warm. 

She played before RlMAC and the 
Price Center were built, when games 
were held in the Main Gym. Events held 
there attracted a lot of attention because 
the Student Ce'nter was the core of stu-
dent· life. 

"Everyone hung out at the Hump," 
she said, "and we would fill the old gym 
[at games] ." 

These memories have motivated her 
to stay involved with UCSD athletics. 

"It's important to come back and sup-
port what was really good to us, and to 
give back," Criswell said. 

Buchanan's experience is similar. He 
too "gives back" to the program 
through Sunset Water Polo, which 
organizes activities to help motivate

Swimmers get wet during exhibition 
Preseason meet allows swimmers to get competitive 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

After fi"e weeks of grueling 
practi es, the UCSD swim team 
finally hit the water in a compcti-
tion at the annual Blue and Gold 
meet OCt. 13 at Canyonvicw Pool. 

The Blue and Gold meet is an 
intersquad competition that divides 
me swim team in half and allows the 
swimmers to get back into a compet-
itive mindset after weeks of training. 

The event was also a chance for 
head coach Scott McGihon to pre-
view what his swimmers will be like 
during the regular season. 

"The meet went real well," 
McGihon said. "We had some very 
good swims from the men and the 
women . It's a good chance to get a 
sense of pseudo-real competition. 
It 's also good for the freshman to 

get used to the meet format that we 
have in college." 

The freshman were a welcome 
surprise for the coach. 

"I am definitely excited about 
the incoming class," McGihon said. 
"They swam better than what we 
recruited them as." 

The women's swim team had a 
solid effort all around. 

"There wasn't a big standout," 
McGihon said. "The returners 
showed that they were ready to step 
up and swim fast and the freshman 
stepped it up and swam fast." 

Overall, the meet left McGihon 
with a good feeling about the 
upcoming season. 

"I think that we are ready to sur-
prise some teams," McGihon said. 
"This meet gave me a lot of hope 
and excitement for the upcoming 
season. n

Water polo has disappointing we~kend 
Tritons rebound with wins after opening loss to UC Irvine 
By CYRUS JAMNEJAD 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team gathered with the top teams 
in me nation at the Avery Aquatic 
Center at Stanford University over 
the weekend for tlte Nor-Cal 
Water Polo Tournament. 

Saturday morning, the Tritons 
met with the 9th-ranked UC 
Irv1l1c Anteater and took a diffi-
cult loss. r..ach team managed one 
goal 111 the first period, but Irvine 

UPCOMING EVENTS 

broke away with four goals in the 
second quarter. Meanwhile, the 
Tritons only managed one and fell 
behind, 5-2. 

The Anteaters scored four 
more goals after the half, and the 
Tritons found the net only three 
times. Down by four points in the 
final period, UCSD tried to come 
back. The team brought itself 
within one point of Irvine with an 
imprcssive run of three unan-

-swered goals, but fell short with a 
tinal score of 9-8. 

Oct. 19, 7 p.m., Tnton' Soccer Stadium: Women's Soccer vs. CSUSB

Senior Brett Allan led the 
Tritons with four goals, and senior 
Jonathan Samuels scored two. 
Senior Vladimir Djapic and junior 
Paul Motschall each scored once. 
Junior goalie Lance Onlcin had 
eight saves in the loss. 

The loss forced the Tritons, 
who were ranked No.7 going into 
the tournament, into the lower 
bracket of the tournament. 

In its second game of the day, 
UCSD took revenge upon 
unranked Santa Clara University. 

The Tritons opened the first 
quarter by scoring six goals against 
Santa Clara's two. The Tritons 
scored five goals over the next two 
periods while holding Santa Clara 
scoreless. In the final period, Santa 
Clara scored once, which was too 
little, far too late. 

Junior Kellan Hori had a hat 
trick for the Tritons while Allan, 
Djapic and freshman Brandon 
Borso each added two. Motschall
