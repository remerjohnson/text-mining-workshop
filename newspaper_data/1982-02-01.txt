Space reserved 
T he UCS D library sy tem has made a decision to 

elimi nate waste in their class reserve system: they 
are simply going to top putting most materials on 
re<;erve. 

A explained by the head librarian of the Science 
and Engineering Library, & E will top putting non-
copyrighted" oft" materials, i.e. exam an.d problem 
olutions, lecture notes, exams from prevlou . year 

and the like. on reserve. Book and copynghted 
ar t icle will remain. The Cluster and Biomed 
libr arie ' will institute the same prohibit ions next 
Fall. 

T he osten ible rea on for such a policy is that uch 
reserve materials create too much work for library 
staff. and neces itate the hiring of extra work- tudy 
personnel. Furthermore. such materials create long 
line at the reserve desks and copy mach Ines, and 
create noi e in those area. The library hopes to 
elimi nate thi . 

The libraries are obviously missing the poi nt. 
There are long lines for these reserve materials 
because they are in such great demand, because they 
are a very impor tan t instructional aid for a large 
majority of studen t on campus. To eliminate the e 
materials from the libraries is to put many tudents 
at a large disadvantage. Students rely on such 
reserves, especially exam and problem set solutions to 
check their work and to discover their mistake, 
important to later success in the class . Students 
deprived of the e tools will master course work to a 
far Ie ser degree, and will do more poorly overall. 

The library cannot expect that each department 
will have the resource to disseminate this material 
on it own. Therefore, if the library eliminates their 
holdings, most of the soft materials will s imply 
disappear. 

But there must be other compromises which can be 
reached . For in stance. all soft reserve materials could 
be placed in a s ingle library. The majority of the 
copying machine. could be moved to that library, and 
thus the "reserve ru s h" would not be duplicated at all 
libra ries. The current -issue periodical section of the 
Central Library might be coll a psed into a s maller 
space, the rema inder being a reserve section , 
complete w ith an army of copy machines and a 
reading area. 

uch ideas must be ex plored . Fa ilingt hat,s tu denls 
mu s t orga ni ze to s how their anger over the new 
library policy. A move to eliminate soft resen 'r 
ma t erials st rikes a t the academ ic hea r t-; of nea rl y all

'34' case ends 
The lega l fa te of the "UCSO 

34", a group of t udent who 
staged a prote. t si t- in of t he 
Chancellor 's offi ce la t June, 
ha f inally been reso lved . 

A compromi e w as reached 
last Thur day between the 
"34" attorney, Clifton Blev in 
and the c ity attorney in w hich 
all 34 students w ill have to pay 
a $25 fine and 31so complete 25 
hours of community ser v ice 
work. 

There wi ll be a di cipl inar y 
rev iew of t he student onju ne 
8, 1982. The r eview is to insure 

that none f t he student have 
violat ed any laws since t he 
t ime of last june's sit-in. 

L as t j une's sit- in - which 
was prompted by the denial of 
tenure to History professor 
Emor y T olbert - involved 
a r o und 30 0 s tud e n ts, 
including the 34 w ho refu 'ed 
to v aca t e t he ch ancell or's 
office. Atkin son then ordered 
pol ice to remove the studen ts 
in a non-v iolent fa hion. 

The dropped charges were 
"t r espassing" and "failure to 
disperse".

Hearings held in 
Piper Vosban case DOOllIBual 

By PA UL FARWELL 
Associutc Ne ws Edi lo." 

Last June, David Piper was 
faced with a difficult decision 
to make: he could eit her do 
what he felt was morally and 
legally " right" - or he could 
obey hi bosses ' order. Piper 
cho e the former. 

At the time Piper was a 
pesticide controller at the 
Uni versity Hospita l who had 
been asked by his superior. in 
the grounds department to 
spray Vos ban - a powerful 
chemical pesticide - around 
the grounds of the University 
Ho pital. For refusing to spray 
the pesticide, Piper claims, he 
wa demoted to groundskeep· 
er. 

The reasons given for 
Piper' refusal are both moral 
and legal: 

"All in . ecticides must be 
s prayed according to t he 
instructions on the label. " 
says Jim tronski. a member of 
the American Federation of 

tate, County and Municipal 
Employees (AF CME) who are 
representing Piper in the case. 
"The instrurtions on the 
Vosban did 1101 state t hat it 
coule. be used in a primary 
health care unit (where babie ' 
and expect ant mot hers come 
for treatment). If it doe. n't say 
you can use it, you can't use it. 
That's the law. " 

And says Cathy Este, 
president of the loca l chapter 
of the AFSCME: "In good faith 
he refused to do something 
which he thought would be 

-.~ If::\\ \VO)i 

har mful to others." 
Grievance Hearings 
A three person grievance 

comm iltee has been establish· 
ed to hear Piper's charges, and 
to report directly to Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson with a 
decision. 

While member of AFSCME 
have been willing to discu s 
what evi dence t hey will 
pre ent before the grievance 
board , administrators in the 
grounds depart ment have yet 
to make a pu blic statement. 

" If David Piper is found not 
gui lty, the implications are 
that it could snowball. and 
lead to investigations of ot her 
departments such as health 
and safety issue such as 
isotope handling," says Este. 

And. moreover , says 
tronski. "(If Piper is found 

guilty), it mean' t hat if you 
know of somet hing illegally 
happening in you r depart· 
ment, you can't report it to 
anyone outside your depart· 
ment. That certainly isn't the 
intent of any law in the 
country. " 

The grievance hearings will 
Ix: held February 8,9,10, 11.12. 
The committee members are: 
Robert Starkey of the Campus 
Planning Office; Tom Frichel, 
a systems analy t at the 
Uni\'ersity Hospital; and 
Jackie Kulhman . 

The committee will report to 
Atkinson sometime around 
the 22nd.

The difference : A Written 

Guaranlee. We have student 
discounts, and evening hours, 

ju I like many other shops. But, 
unlike o thers, we back up all our 

work in writing . If, after we've cut, 
permed, or colored your hair, you ' re 
not completely happy, call us within 

seven days. We' ll redo your hair at no 
eXIra cha rge. That's a big difference.

Final showing tonight at Museum 
BY TIM AUGUST 

Sl uff Wriler 

The 1982 Feslillal 0/ 
Allimation at the La jolla 
Mu eum of Contemporary Art 
this past weekend was a huge 
success. The film s featured 
had themes from the fun to the 
fantastic with some exhibiting 
the very late t in animation 
technique and concept. Among 
the 14 short and the severa l 
"television commercia l" 
entries were definitely some 
!'ourI' bet s for Academy Award 
nom i nat ions t his year. 

The entire program is wort h 
mentioning but there were 
several rilms that deser\' e 
special notice. One of Will 
Vinton 's latest works, 
Creatioll, definitely merit s 
such notice, The film features 
a ne\\' form of animation called 
"Claymat ion" which is s imply 
a t\\'o dimensional drawing in 
colored clay. Thi" tech nique 
allows t he landscapes and 
rot'ms within to swi rl alx)ut 
and m It into each ot her, 
creating a positively stunning 
efrecl. However, the melo· 
dramatic narration by james 
Earl jones al times took too 
much away from the film, 
making un co mfortabl e 
compet ili on between the 
animation and its narration . 

Ferenc Rofusz' The Fly wac 
undoubtably une of the 
program's greatest high light s, 
This film is the bizarre view of 
the world t hr ugh t he eyes of a 
fly. As the fl y, the audience is 
treated to a glimpse of the 
i nsid of a hous from the 
persp ctive of the tiny insect, 
and what it feels liketotry to 
escap from a fl y swatter. 

Th audience finds 
themselves trapped behind a 
window pane as the fly moves 
fran t ically about trying to 
escape from t he ~w aller. 
Through all thi s the aud ience 
was practically rolling in the 
ai!->Ies, but when the fly finally 
met with it's demise one cou ld 
f I a genuine sense of despair 
among t he crowd. The pen and 
ink drawings in this film were 
quite s imple but the overall 
effect was perfect. The Fly 
dese rved the Academy Award

it received al la st year's 
ceremony. 

No No Pickle by john 
Wokoluk is a comedic take-off 
of Arlo Guthrie's "Motorcycle 
Song" and features a vocal 
track by Guthrie. The piece 
reminded me of a 1940's 
comedy musical with a fair 
share of s lap-s tick. Wokoluk 
was at lhe theater Saturday to 
answer questions about the 
film but the audience did not 
take the chance to ask any 
su b"tantive qu stions, The 
mos t inquisitive ques l ion 
asked was "Why is the pickle 
not as colorful as in the 
movi e?" upon which Wokoluk 
dutifully replied that lat ex 
rades wit h t illle . Oh well , I 
guess there w re no aspiring 
animators in the crowd. 

Aft er in term iss ion we were 
treated to I he delight full y 
di~gust in g Fish/wufs by 
Barnes & Barnes. A It hough 
not a true animated work, the 

~ hort was unques t ionably well 
received by the audience. Dr. 
D mento, who L .o lel y to 
credit for the success of the 
Barn es & Barnes song of the 
same title also playccl a ca meo 
bit in th film. 

In addition to the rilms were 
several animated co mmer-
cials, some of which were 
familiar to the audience, 
ot hers were from foreign 
market s. The best of the~e 
included the current "Kitty 
Salmon" commercial as well 
as one for "Vladivar Vodka." 
Be watching for Cleo A ward 
nom inal ions ror one of these. 

The final e for the program 
was Mike jitlov's Wizard 0/ 
Speed alld Time. Jitluv is the 
ma ster of step-frame li\'e 
animation and uses hi s talent 
to create some of the funnie"t 
pieces or film ever shot. Like 
his other films, he us es the 
stop-frame technique to sho\\' 
himself running at supersonic 
speeds, passing trains, cars, 
747's, and landscapes. In 
WiUlrd he ult imately slips on a 
banana peel al a million miles

Monk dance group 
on stage this week 

By TOMMY LANNEVILLE 
On Tuesday and Wednesday the UCSD community will have 

an opportunity to make contact With someone whom man\ 
people are calling one of the most exciting and richly rewarding 
arti sts in America today. Meredit h Monk's audience includes 
fans of modern dance. nell' theater, and music both IX)pular and 
highbrow. 

Those li steners ram iliar with modern \'oeal gymnasts like 
David Byrne or Lene Lovich or with si ngers from other 
traditions such as the muzzei n's call to the faithful will ha\'e 
little difficulty in following the oblique rise and fall of Monk's 
\'ocallines. (This is not to suggestlhat her music remindsoneof 
the Talking Heads or that it is a prayer, though those 
connections can occur.) 

imilarly , dance mavens who followed Merce Cunningham 
right up to where he walked-like-dancing (or was it danced -like-
walking?) will recogni ze the ele\ at ion of everyday act i\' it ies mlo 
a rich and flexible language of mo\'emen!. 

Monk explores many themes in h r work - metamorphosIs in 
the individual. relations with societ y. even contact with that 
which is usually outside t he realm o( the hu man. lI er work is a 
mixture of mime, music and motion, able by tUI n" to signify the 
human and the transcendent, to entertain as well a ' to sati:f • .

Men's and women's 
tennis undefeated 

By PA UL AMBROGIO 
Bot h t he women \ and men 's tennis teams were victorious 

aturday at the Muir courts with respcctive wins over 
Pomona/ Pitzer and Dominguez Hills. 

The women's team had their closest match of the eason with 
an 8· 1 triumph , In the eighteen doubles and s ing les matches the 
leam has P);:lyed this year they have lost only one, Last year's 
female al hlete of the year, Cecilia Kavanagh, although ill , was 
instrumenlal in the victory with a 6·4, 7·5singl s triumph and a 
6·-1,6·5 doubles \Vin teaming with Laura aavedra, 

Kavanagh is a pat ient but quick defen. ive player who rel ies on 
her solid groundstrokes and accurate lobs to force her opponent 
to mak mistakes, 

Number 2 seeded Vikki Lareau was also impressive with a 6·2, 
6·2 single victory and was joined by NadineAkimoto for a 6·3, 6· 
~ dou hIes success. 

Lareau possesses a controlled lob and an accurate serve. She 
caused her frus trated opponent to run all over the court by 
moving the ball around during the long vollies. Coach Liz 
Dudash commented, "Vikki is playing better each match, " 

Throughout the day , number five seeded Laura aavedra 
ret urned everything hit in her direction, including difficu lt low 
shots on the half bounce and nearl y impo sible balls trailing 
away from her. Us ing 21 one· handed backhand he was able to 
reach the ball while totally extended then use enough angle on 
her racket to keep the ball in play. 

Nadine Akimoto was devastating in her doubles mat ch. She 
played the net aggressively, often slamming the ball down the 
middle of the court bet ween her helpl s: opponent ', During this 
match both teams were fearlessly playing the net. intercepting 
the ball in mid·flight and ramming it down each other's throats. 

Last year's team was number one in their division and 6th in 
the regional '. Although on ly two player ' are returnin~ , 
Kavanagh remarked, "We're a lot stronger this year. Last year s 
number two girl is number s ix this year. " 
After the match coach Dudash ("()mmented, ''I'm really proud of 
the way the girls played with such confidence." 

Eugene jones, Dan Sl1lpes and Dave Sider fared well in the

Bookends in the backcourt 
Guards Wight and Goodman set pace for UCSD basketball team 

BY 808 M t:S PADD EN 
Scn im" S ial( \Vrifl' r 

For the 19R2 men' s cage 
team. which has weat hered 
five losses by five points or less 
and played in six overtime 
games. the road to a midseason 
8·10 record has been a little 
rocky. 

ever mind t he loss of 6'4" 
forward Michael Barney, who 
before being claimed by the 
academics at UCSD had 
averaged fifteen points a game 
and just under five rebounds. 
Discount also 6'8" forward· 
center Mark Barreca. second 
tallest member on the team 
who pull ed down seven 
rebounds a game before 
bowing also to the tough 
scholarly req u irements here. 
To furth er tax the Tritons' 
depth was the loss o f 6'5" 
sophomore Matt Adam', a 
lanky forward who despite 
seeing limit ed action had 

grabbc'<i five boards a show ing 
a nd passed off for a total of 
e ight een assi~ t s. 

But no one makes excuses in 
this game. There isn't time for 
it when you have the AlA 
national' frontrunner Biola 
College in your league and 
must deal wit h some very 
aspiring opposition. While 
6'fW/' center Mike Dabansin · 
skas cont inue ' to grow bet ter 
underneath and forwards 
Ke\'in Flaig and Mike Maross 
i m pro\'!> bot h on t he boards 
and shooting, the scoring this 
year is moti va ted in the 
backcourt by guards Tom 
Wight and Bob Goodman. 

"We know that to win we 
have to shoot, and much of our 
offense is des igned to give us 
the ball. " co mmented 
Goodman after a 105·98 win 
Thursday night over Sout hern 
California College, where the 
iunior from Detroit. Michigan 

led a ll scorers with 2(i point s. 
Wight agrees with hi s 

pan ner on the court . and feels 
that. "wc kno\\' each ot her 
in side and out and t hat makes 
'it eas ier on t he floor . I can 
make a terrible pass and 
,omehow he always comes up 
wit h it. We work we ll 
toget her." 

Head basket ball coordi nator 
Jo hn Block i s equa ll y 
optimistic about having two 
st rong players to fi II the 
backcollrt holes , and not es how 
easy it is to coach t he duo, 
"They learn very quickly and 
are very eager players. We'd be 
at a loss without either Bobor 
Tom," he explains. 

confidence to play pro ball in 
t he European leagues bleed,; 
through . "Right no\\' I' m 
enjoying playing here and 
\\'anl to do th e best for UC D 
and \\'in as mallY game~ as we 
can ... 

For lIC San Diego. which 
pushed its' league mark to :3·2 
Saturday night in a 76·71 
overt i me conq ues! of Ca l 
Lut heran, bot h players are 
very valuable. 

Out of shape wrestlers hit mats 

The scoring from out s ide 
this season is a complete tu rn 
arou nd from the 1981-82 stats, 
where forecourt standouts 
Sherman Johnson and Gary 
Haynes tallied a majority of 
the point s. Ass istant coach 
Torn Marsha ll illu strates, 
"We go with our trength, and 
t hi s yea r the guards are the 
best shooters." 

n Ult inued {rom "a~l' J:I

Berndes made some a llow·

Contreras 8·:~ for the 
championship. 

Contreras. like many of the 
wrest lers, oft en fought out of 
his weight class. Hi s three 
opponent ~ ou t \\' eight ed him by 
an average of H pounds. 

found hi;n self grappling with 
Steve Forak er, 145, the 
e\'entual champion of the 139· 
1·1j division. He lost. Earlier, 
in perhaps the most talented 
match·up of the day, Sanders 
gave away' anot her 15 pounds 
to 0Plxment Stev/, ayre. 

For Wight , -a politica l 
science major whose player 
eligibility expires after th is 
season , the future beyond 
l CSD is very opportunist ie. '" 
don't want to rely on anythi ng 
that might not happen , so I 
JUS! keep playing basket ball 
t he best I can." There have 
been hi n t s of a pro scou t or two 
in the neighborhood. 

The Ix)(]r turnout (only 25 
pari icipants) forced Berndes to 
con"olidate the origina l 12 
weigh t divisions into fil'e . 
This leads to some interes ting, 
occas ionally lopsided,
