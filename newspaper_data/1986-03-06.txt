World Savi~ and Loan gains 

Legislative analyst 
Hamm resigns 

By MARIKO TAKAYASU, Capitol Correspondent 
Legislative Analyst William G. Hamm announced on Friday 

that ~e is resigning .his $83,380-a-year job for a position with 
the SiXth largest savmgs and loan association in the state. 

The 43-y~ar-old Hamm is expected to leave his post in 
Apnl. He Will then bec?me vice-president for Operations 
AnalYSIS for World SaVIngs and Loan, headquartered in 
Oakland. 

Hamm said he could "happily" remain the state's non-
partisan budget analyst, but "the challenges and opportunities 
offered b~ my. new job, were just too appealing to pass up." 

.~he leglslanve analyst is responsible for issuing an annual 
critique of the governor's proposed budget. Last week. Hamm 
released ~ 1,753-page document of the governor's spending 
plan, which proVides members of the legislature a non-
partisan tool in drafting the final version of the budget for the 
follOwing fis cal year, which begins July 1. 

In the anlaysis, Hamm recommended that student fees for 
UC and CSU be increased by at least 7.5 percent. Gov. 
George Deukmejian's proposed budget calls for no fee 
increases. 

However, a long-term fee policy was implemented by the 
state last year, so that students would not experience 
unexpected increases like those which occurred in the early 
1980's. 

Hamm expects to receive "a lot of hear" for the fee 
recommendation, but said there is no "reason why the state 
should abandon a policy approved by the legislature and the 
governor within the last six months." 

~though his recommendations are disputed by various 
legislators , Hamm is regarded highly by both Democrats and 
Republicans for his ~on-p~~isan analysis .t~ ~~'~L~' "J.) • 
... Recently, ~ukmeJlan cnuclzed .Hamm for making 
Irresp.or,tslble sta~ments that Californians would be paying 

$2.4 billion more m state taxes during the governor's tenure 
due to increased taxes and revenue changes. 

"I can't say that working for the legislature has always been 
a piece of cake," Hamm said. "There have been some difficult 
moments." 

Hamm is a former federal budget analyst. He graduated 
magna cum laude from Dartmouth College, and received his 
M.A and Ph.D. in economics from the UniverSity of 
Michigan . 

Selected lO the state posirion in 1977, Hamm overseas a 
staff of 90. He is the thirg person lO hold ~ __ positiOft'"S1nte 
the office was establtshed in 1941. Hamm's replacement will 
be st;lected by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, which 
COnsiSts of seven members from both the Assembly and 
Senate. ~

Media referendum 
goes to AS council 

The elections, including 
referenda, are scheduled for April 
8-9. 

A prior committee with the 
same purpose, but without media 
representation , was formed by 
the council in January but later 
was dissolved after the 
controversial resignation of 
Administrative Vice President 
Ariel Anguiano, who stirred up 
several student and community 
organizations and the alternative 
media, by claiming the AS was 
ignoring 'alternative' views. 

of the media representatives that 
walked out of the meeting. "It 
seemed that was one of the best 
ways to get a voice in to the AS, 
but it didn't seem to work o ut." 

According to Lilys McCoy, the 
committee's chair, the media 
funding referendum, which was 
submitted to the council despite 
the media walk out, will ask 
students three questions 
conceming funding the papers. 
A survey will be taken 
co nceming each individual 
paper, asking students if they 
wish to support them. The 
second question will give three 
choices on the amount of 
funding given the media: to give 
each paper a limit of $4,000 a 
year maximum, to give them 
$1.50 per student per quarter, or 
nOl to fund them at all. The last 
question focuses on how to 
divide student funds to the 
papers, and will give several 
alternatives, according to

A FTER WEEKS OF frustration, the AS . Council wiD be voting on 
the alternative media funding 
referendum designed to query 
student opinion in the AS 
elections this spring. 

The action comes despite 
strong opposition from the 
media, who claim that the AS is 
using the funding issue to 
eradicate critical and 
controversial views that are 
expressed in their papers. The

the committee's first and only 
fully attended meeting last 
Monday. The purpose of the 
committee is to research all 
alternatives for funding and to 
design the referendum question. 
They said that they have not 
been allowed enough time or 
input to fonnulate anything 
constructive . 

The committee, which was 
fonned by the AS in February 
had a little more than a week to 
conduct its investigation anc;I 
submit the draft of its 

samples of medicines like they 
would for a commercial heakh 
care operation, he said. 

Colin Jessop , married to Eloise 
Deleon, a UCSD student, who 
heard about the clinic through 
an advertising Oyer, probably 
would not have brought his kids 
lO the doctor if it were not for 
the clinic, he said. "We really 
would just have had to deal with 
it," Jessep said in reference to 
his son's cold. 

The clinic uses an 
appoinunent basis to insure that 
an who need care wiD receive it, 
Howell said. Currently, they are 
seeingfivc to six patients during 
each clinic; most are under five 
years of age, some under 10, and 
there is even an octasional teen, 

referendum to the AS council. 
"It's impossible to meet the 

deadline set up by the council," 
said media representative Joe 
Wainio. "We couldn't possibly 
come up with anything in rwo 
hours." 

According to AS preSident 
Mary Rose Alexander, the 
committee's deadline has been 
$et for ninth week to allow time 
for the referendum to be 
approved by the council and 
because the ballots for the AS 
election are goi ng to be printed

she said. 
Clinics are held Monday, 

Tuesday and Thursday nights 

The new committee met for 
the first time last Monday and 
quickly started debating on 
whether to consider the research 
and recommendations of the 
previous committee and if there 
was enough time lO fo nnulate a 
well balanced refe rendum

Ime~stingly, Howell, who 

"feels she has the best of all 
worlds," has never married or 
had any children of her own. 
Educated in pediatrics at McGill 
School of Medicine, she went to 
specialize as a pediatric 
hemotologic oncologist after 
residencies at Duke and Harvard 
Universities. Paying 11 years of 
dues teaching at the Women's 
Medical College of Pennsylvania 
(which is now co-ed) she came 

. to San Die!J> in 1974 to become 
an "active and working" 
community physician. 

From 1975-1980 she served as

Community and FamHv 
Medicine, before taking her

Howell gives out her home

Howell also works to better

Mexican-American border, 
specifically for chidren. There 
she has helped estabush

Estranged from Academia 
In American post-industrial society, we 

welcome. with moral and financial support, 
manifestations of great intellectual power. We 
applaud the mechanized inventions which 
project man's dominance in the world, as we 
also praise those who have tried to harness 
dangerous sources of energy. 

Unfortunately, despite our great interest in 
technology, we have only begun to address 
the problems of living. Works to preserve and 
protect, which have traditionally been 
performed by women, have been treated as if 
they are less rigorous, simple-minded and of 
inferior quality. Concerns about day to day 
personal interactions have been looked upon 
as smaller and subordinate to esoteric 
academic theories. Crafts begun primarily to 
enrich the home and private life rather than 
the public sphere receive less respect than 
engineering works which have aimed to 
change public activity. 

Generally, the university and academics 
emphasize new forms of production. They do 
not recognize the need to preserve and 

reproduce. University existence proVides an 
open forum for people to deny the limits of 
and assert authority over nature. We 
investigate ways to make ourselves more 
powerful, more commanding and more 
knowledgeable, but we do not always seek 
ways through which to understand the 
ramifications of our theories in our lives. 

The preserving and nurturing works of 
women have been looked upon as trivial in 
the past. They have been degraded because 
they are not inventions which strike out in 
the world. 

The university is biased against the works 
of women if they do not. fit the formula of 
strictly academic work. Preserving and 
nurturing works have been looked upon as 
trivial examples of ways to manage private 
life. The works that women have espoused 
are nor made to be inventions that strike out 
at the world, but they have encouraged 
working within the real world. 

Unfortunately, the university system has yet

A bad joke 
Editor: 
An open letter to Dr. WatsOn. 

We are writing in objection to 
a valentine message which 
appeared in the Feb. 5 issues of 
The Koala . The message read : 
"Don't cry. baby. Sometimes love 
hurts . And remember, It's our 
linle secret. Love, Daddy." As you 
can see , It is a tasteless joke 
about a very scnous issue for 
women and men - Incest. 

The Koala conSistently 
contains sexual innuendos which 
are degrading to women, but we 
genraUy chalk these up to bad 
taste and immaturity of students 
who use women, ethnic groups 
and others as the brunt of their 
jokes. 

With the current anic1e we 

press and we feel that the 
university community and the 
administration needs to speak 
out to The Koala to let them 
know that these limits extend to 
the campus press as well . 

Thank you for your attention 
to this matter.

The politics of surfing 
Editor: 

We are writing to question 
Byron MoTt0I1'S allegations against 
AS. Council members Gre.sory 
MacCrone and Michael 

consider the fact that MacCrone 
is a surfer? While there are many 
surfers at this school , they are 
not a majority of the student 
population. We feel that, 
according to Monon's mode of 
thought, we have to call into 
quescon MacCrone's surfing 
tendencies as not being fully 
representative of the entire 
UCSD student body. 

As for Fahlbusch, isn't he 
much too taU to be a 
representative of the UCSD 
population? Further more , he is 
an immigrant. Can we allow such 
a person to be a representative 
of UCSD? According to MoTton , 
probably not. 

to provide a forum for investigating works 
which are not highly academic and timeless. 
Academics have learned to live and think 
outside of the world in which they live. They 
live somewhe're in the future , or somewhere 
in the past, but they do not feel the need to 
respond, daily, to the world. 

This is International Women's Week, and 
the only recognizable support for nurturing 
works is hidden away at the Che Cafe. At 
this exhibition we are beginning to address 
some of the often forgotten needs for 
preservation that we all feel. Separate 
exhibitions should not have to continue in 
the future . But until the univerSity, in 
panicualr, and the American academic 
community, as a whole, begin to encourage 
concern for the earth, private relationships 
and daily life for which women have been 
responsible in the past, women must 
continue to create their own fora for 
presenting the morality and artistiry of the 
future as they envision it. 

feel we must speak out. Incest is 
not a joke and the incredible 
insensitivity of The Koala edirors 
on this subject warrants at least a 
reprimand by the administration 
at UCSD. 

The statistics now show that 
o ne out of evety five college 
women has been sexually 
abused , many by their fathers . 
These women have been 
traumatized for life. 

Fahlbusch in the March 3 
Opinions sections of the UCSD 
Guardian. The title of Morton's 
letter read "Anti-Semitism?" 

As Jews, we are not offended 
by the disputed cartoon. We feel 
that Morton's charges against 
MacCrone and Fahlbusch are 
ridiculous; it is an insi pid 
implication to state that the 
canoon displayed in the AS 
office is a defamatory remark 
against 'Jews and Palestinian 
Arabs." 

As one can easily see, we 
question MoTton's intentions. We 
ask the readers of the Guardian 
to examine whether MoTton 
raised this issue in the defense 
of Jews and Palestinian Arabs or 
as a personal vendetta against 
the two council members. 

David Marchick

Jeff Schapiro 

it is necessary that I clarify my 
intentions in posting on my AS 
office door (an office shared by 
Commissioner of 
Communications, Michael 
Fahlbusch) a cartoon by Jim 
Berry. 

Other times, he is downright 
satirical. 

In his letter to the Guardian on 
Monday, Byron MOTton brought 
to the attention of UCSD this 
particular cartoon which was 
posted on my office door. His 
pronouncement of his 
displeasure and subsequent 
personal attacks on Fahlbusch at

is unfonunate , because if it were 
not for the inherent hypocrisy 
that pervades Morton's being, 
this politically motivated attack 
on the twO of us would never 
have occurred. 

Monon is a contributor to at 
least twO of our campus 
alternative media , one of which 
is openly anti-Zionist and anti-
Jewish. I speak of the new 
indicator. Be that as iI may. 
Monon writes that he is 
offended by the altered cartoon. I 
am dubious of his judgment of 
my actions because he works for 
a newspaper which promotes 
anti-Semitism (with respect to 
Jews). I don 't think that he 
accurately presents the train of 
thought that is the apparent 
motivation for my alterations. 

In addition, it is obvious to 
me that Monon's statements are 
representative of a personal 
vendetta that he holds for 
Michael and me. It is an 
understatement to say that 
Morton and I do not ascribe to 
the same political ideology. 

Monon intends to seek the 
Commissioner of 
Communications post this next 
spring quarter. I am secure in the 
thought that he feels any 
publicity he may receive via a 
letter to the Guardian will benefit 
him, however unsubstantiated 
his claims may be. A person who 
fails to understand the simple 
notion behind a simple cartoon 
is surely unqualified to hold an 
elected position. 

Monon is a hypocrite. He is 
involved with a paper that 
suppOrtS anti-Zionism and the 
abolition of the Israeli state . vet 
he claims that, as a Jew, he is 
offended by the comic. One 
cannot adhere to both 
philosophies. They are 
contradictory. 

Morton says that he is 
"concerned about ... the bad 
taste" exhibited by Michael and 
me. Well, perhaps he should 
take an introspective look at 
himself and question the ethics 
of using the media to launch 
character assassinations on the 
two of us. If he is honest with 
himself, he will discover that the 
canoon was not an attempt to 
degrade his heritage , but simply 
a slap at Arafat and Khaddafy 
themselves. 

The reason that I pinned 
MoTton and Monte's names 
above the twO caricatures was 
that I saw a humorous parallel 
between the fanaticism displayed 
by Arafat and Khaddafy and the 
similar zeal the two of them 
employ is assailing the AS. To 
analyze the cartoon beyond that 
is missing the obvious satire so 
common to the author. 

I shall not "remove (myselO ... 
from public office," as Monon 
requests. Rather, I will cQntinue 
to execute my job as capably as I 
can.

Reflection upon a 
double identity 
By TINA RICH. Staff Wnttr 

A GENTLE GREEN landscape cradles its homely child , Tla tenango. 
The streets are a mixture of dust, 
stone and poveny - the sagging 
white houses that line them are 
like little huts. Some of the huts 
have din floors and many have 
small children running in and 
out of them, Just like in the 
movies. Others are more 
decorated and normal looking. 
What they all have in common 
are prolific displays of icons and 
flowered portraits of the Virgin 
of Guadalupe. 

The church is nor only the 
spiritual center of the home, but, 
like most of Mexico, is the center 
of town. It's a dramatic building 
standing by the plaza, with a 
beautiful garden where, on 
weekend evenings, boys and girls 
stroll around in opposite 
directions looking for dates. 

The manicured plaza, lush 
greenery and romatic mist of 
Catholicism make poveny look 
more personal than it really is. 

Every year Alicia tries to make 
a pilgrimage to Tlatenango where 
she was born and raised, back to 
her roots and away from her 
American husband. This town is 
super-imposed under her feet 
and in her mind . It quietly 
stumbles through life under the 
reproachful stare of Howard's 
brooding intellect and her own 
education. 

Having acquired Americanisms 
in the process of her marriage ro 
Howard, and in earning two 
degrees, she views this poor 
backwater town as just that, 
compared to her experiences 
from a middle-class life syle in 
the United States. She needs to 
go back to Tlatenango, just ro 
make sure a pan of her past is 
still in her. 

Alicia is one of nine siblings 
and only one of two to get an 
education; her mother scorned

teal , 
tangerlne 

her. She fully believed Alicia 
wem ro school only to avoid 
work. 

Howard's law number One is 
"You can't deal with uneducated 
people: So it goes, as Kun 
Vonnegut would say. 

Alicia's brother Gabriel works 
barely enough to suppOrt himself 

and his wife, but the babies keep 
coming - Alicia and Howard 
can't understand it. Deep down , 
she can, but it's not really her 
anymore . Gabriel has cracked up 
several cars and added an

impressive collect.ion of traffic 
violations to hIS list of 
achievements. 

Jose, another brorher, has left 
the loving anns of the church for 
the Jehovah's Witnesses; and 
Alicia's niece, Alma, accused one 
of Jose's sons of molesting her, 
but there was nothing anyone 

could prove. 
She complained to Howard 

that the incident made her feel 
inferior; that this is what and 
where she comes from - it 
seemed as if she thought

respectable people could see 
through her. 

Howard likes to elaborate on 
these and other bumblings of 
Alicia's illiterate family, and the 
fact that you can't deal with 
uneducated people. 

Illiterate and uneducated, 
perhaps, but her family sure 
makes a big deal when someone 
reaches a turning point in their 
lives - be it a birthday, first 
communion, wedding, baptism 
or haircut. They haven't had a 
parry for a haircut yet, but a 
binhday celebration for a child is 
a major affair, even if he can 
only say "gaga." All the brothers 
and sisters usually gather at the 
mother'S house. Nina, a sister, 
makes her famous Persian rice 
and two-layered iello - a real 

.. .. ~ 

feast, and they have all the food 
they can drag out of the kitchen. 

Children are a big pan of their 
lives and her family does not 
exclude them from adult socials 
as Americans tend to do. 

Patricia, Alicia's mother, is very 
generous with the food even 
though they don't have much 
money, so Howard bought her a 
microwave oven. He's very free 
with money whenever Alicia's 
family needs it, although he 
hates going over to their get-
togethers. He says they don't 
have any abstract ideas; they just 
talk about concrete things in 
their own lives and have no 
curiosity about the world or 
anything, and they'd be even 
more boring in English. He still 
thinks that way, but his snobbish 
derision was washed away when 
Elena, one of Alicia's sisters, died 
of cancer. Elena was 
reduced from a beautiful . 
young woman to a sack 01 skin 
and bonts when she died at 28 

Elena's husband took her to 
Montpellier, France, in search of 
better treatment, and Howard 
sem along one of Alica's other 
sisters as a companion. The 
agonizing experience of seeing 
this woman deteriorate made 
Howard and Alicia realize how 
suddenly life can take a tragic 
twn and time was not something 
to be taken for granted. 

Howard has grown much more 
tOlerant of her family since then, 
and in general , from aD the years 
with Alicia. Now he does things 
like buying Alicia's friend's 
daughter a tricycle. 

He will always be the middle-
class American intellectUal who 
mums into this country -
characterizing what America 
represents to the reS! of the 
world, wealthier, better 011'. Her 
family and Tlante~ngo minor 
her own feelin~ of inadequacy 
- she will always be the girl 
with no shoes inside the body of 
an educated half-Americanized 
woman. Their marriage exists on 
some opaque interface whett 
these notions evaporate, its 
location known only to them. 
Their years together have been 
the happiest of their lives, 
nutured by a natural 
compatability which helps to 
bypass emotionaDy potent 
differences. 

Last June, Alicia and her 
family had a surprise retirement 
party for Howard. He was very 
grateful and appreciative, even 
though they do talk about the 

, weather. Iz:J

Golfers tee off 
on Div. I rivals 
By DAVID TEDROW, StaffWriur 

T HE MOST likely place for College Division and Neil a forest fire in San Diego Ehlinger from CSULB, was the is at the Torrey university'S medalist. Weishan's 
Pines Golf Course, or any golf two-day total of 148 included a 
course for that maner where the final round of 69, which was the 
UCSD golf team is playing - low round for the entire 
that's how hot they are. The tournament - college and 
team blazed to two tournament university level. Following 
victories last weekend , beating Weishan for UC;SD was Kevin 

( Division I rivals USIU, UCI and "Buddy" Lea with a 154 San Diego State in the process. This tournament victory might 
Take the Southern California be good enough for some teams , 

Intercollegiate Tournament at but UCSD is not a team in the 
Torrey Pines last friday and habit of resting upon their 
Saturday for example. In the laurels. So Monday found the 
college division, which included team at the San Diego Country 
a few Division I, II and NAJA Oub playing in the USD 
teams as well as Division 1Il tournament. In the most 
teams, the winning team was surprising victory of the season, 
UCSD. In fact, UCSD won this UCSD came away with the 
division by 10 strokes over tourrrament championship, 
runners-up Cal Lutheran, and beating Division I powers SDSU, 
Loyola Marymount. USIU and UCI in the process. 

USC won the university Freshman Brad Sterling, playing 
division with a 581 total. This the course for the first time, shot 
was 32 shots better than UCSD's a 73 to lead the Tritons and to 
winning total, so the Tritons still finish second individually. 
have a ways to go to becoming Weishan and Lea both shot 75s, 
Division I champions. Following tyin2 them for founh overall. 
USC were Cal State Long Beach This, along with 79s by Mike 
and San Diego State with 585 O'Laughlin and Fritz Rebers, was 
and 590, respectively. good enough to bring UCSD 

In the individual competition, home four shots ahead of ua 
UCSD's Pat Weishan won the If"d nine ahead of SDSU. ~ Tra'ck leaD} hopeful 
in All SO Dleet 
T HERE MAY BE no Bubkas, Olsens or Brisco-Hooks present, but UCSD's track 
and field team will get an 
opponunity to demonstrate its 
prowess ~m~<?n~ .i~ brothers in 
America' s finest CIty Ift' the All-
San Diego meet sponsored by 
Jack in the Box, Saturday at San 
Diego State University. 

The meet will involve aD four-
year institutions in San Diego -
Point Loma, USIU, USD, UCSD 
and host San Diego State. 

UCSD coach Andy Skief sees 
two potential national quali fiers 
in Gisele English and Erica 
Rothenberger. English, an 800-
meter runner, has a time of 2:22 

and needs a 2:16 to qualify- lOr 
Nationals. Rothenberger, a .3000-
meter runner, has a time of 
10:34 and needs a 10:14 for the 
road to the nationals. 

"Both girls are running 
comfonably and have a good 
chance of going to nationals. I 
see no reason why they won't," 
said Skief. Overall, though, depth 
is a problem for the team; ' We've 
had some average times and 
we've had nothing outstanding 
so far. We're lacking depth in 
weight division and field events 
- we just don't have enough 
individuals in that field," said 
Skief.

Tennis 
topples 
UN LV 
By DAVID TEDROW,Sraff Writtr 

U CSD'S WOMEN'S tenni~ wem two and one last week by beating 
the University of Nevada at Las 
Vegas and Point Loma 
University, with only the 
University of San Diego 
preventing the Tritons from 
sweeping the week. These 
matches, all against Division I 
schools, raised the team's record 
to 5 and 2. 

The first match was last 
Tuesday at home against Point 
Lorna, a small Division I school 
in the NAJA association of 
colleges. these schools are not 
pan of the NCAA, and as such, 
do not face the NCAA's 

<> scholarship restrictions. ~ However, the unpaid Tritons had 
no problem with them, beating 
Point Loma 8 to 1. Caroline Lee displays intense conccntmtion on her serve against Point Lorna. 

The next day however, the 
Tritons ran into a much tougher 
opponent at the University of 
San Diego. Here the tables were 
turned as UCSD lound 
themselves on the short end of 
an 8 to 1 score . The only victory 
for UCSD came in the number-
one doubles match 6-2, 6-4. 

T oros score early 
and often vs. UCSD 
SPOTTING A Division U powerhouse like Cal State Dominguez Hills (ranked 
number three in the nation) 10 
runs in the first four innings is 
not a good idea. After faDing 
behind 8 to 1 in !he first three 
innings, UCSD's basebaD team 
went down to its ninth defeat 
against four losses and a tie , 
losing to the Toros 10-6 despite 
a late comeback. 

After the loss, however. coach 
Lyle Yates did nor sound the 
panic button. ·We knew that 
February would be our toughest 
month," said Vates, "and though 
we're not pleased with our 
record, all we have to do it 
remember what kind of a baD 
club we have, based upon our 
fall record (19-6-1). March and 
April will be easier as we prepare 
for the ~It!onals. " 

The Tritons are not operating 
at full strenRth , and Bob Natal -

leading the club in home runs 
with 5 and RBI's with 20 - is 
the most recent casualty. The 
rightfielder/ catcher twisted an 
ankle when he stepped on a ball 
during practice. UCSD had to 
field a makeshift lineup Tuesday 
against the Toros as Dan 
DiMascio is still only "about 80 
percent" while recovering from a 
pulled hamstring. DiMascio went 

. 2 for 4 with a pair of RBI's and a 
: solo homer to ri2ht center. Derek 
A1konis had to fill in behind the 
plate and pitched in with a two-
run homer in the ei2hth to make 
'the game closer. Vates also singled 
out Brian Rude (2 for 3) and 
Gary Fessia (two sac t1ies) for 
their performances in the losing 
cause. Statter Frank Califano (0-
3) took the loss. 

The Tritons take on Westmont 
this Friday at 2:30 on Olsen 
Field across from Scripps 
Hospital. -by John Schacht 

On Friday the Tritons played 
their most exciting match of the 
week, here against UNL V. The 
two teams were tied at three 
going into double 
competition. Here, Vernon and 
Merickel again played girls they 
had lost to in individual play, 
and again, just like at USD, they 
came out ahead, winning 7-6, 6-
3. However the match wasn't 
decided until Denise Sugi and 
Caroline Wong won their 
doubles match 6-1, 6-1 giving 
UCSD the match 5 to 4. 

The team pkys CSU San 
Bernardino here tomorrow at 
2;00 pm, then travels to 
Occidental on Saturday to play 
their Division U\ rivals. On 
Monday the team plays their 
last home match of the quaner 
against the University of Kansas 
on the Muir C(Juns at 3:00

1951, an American 
premiere by Ann Bogart, 
opens tomorrow at the Weiss 
Center Theatre. It promises to 
be the great spectacle of the 
UCSD theatre year. Bogart, 
regenu' lecturer this quarter 
with the drama depanmc:nt, 
has conceived and directed 
1951. The work grew from her 
personal quest to understand 
the Hollywood inquisition 
and blacklisting. Two dozen 
actors will tell the story as if 
they were making it into a 
movie. 

In 1982, Ann Bogart wrote: 
l'tIe been trying to understand 

an appaTent lack of social and 
political engagement in the 
mainstream and amnt-gaTde 
theatre in the United States, and 
what happened to an impulse 
generated during the '3Of in the 
theatre rmmrds a maniage of 
artistic quality and social 
rele...ancei why that did not 
become a tradition in American 
(MatTe, and why that impulse is 
not a smwce for w today. What 
we hatJe inherited at best are 
acting techniques ba.sed on the 

~mericanitation of the 
''1nisla",ky ""stem. 
Through a kind of roots search 

I found out that the govemment 
machinery of the !au' "Of and 
''os in America, with its anti-
communist paranoia, was faT 
mOTe mccessful in taking control 
of artistic directions than most of 
w hatJe t\AeT imagined OT 
dreamed. Not only did it destrcry 
OT Techannel the work of OUT best 
aTtists and innovators, but it 
wiped out the notion fOT 
followin¥ generations that art 
has a junction of social and 
political criticism. 

The child of a Navy family, 
director I writer Ann Bogart 
was born in 1951. She has 
pursued a theatrical career 

with works in Germany, 
Switzerland and the United 
States. For six years she has 
taught at New York 
University, and caused one 
critical stir recently with her 
interpretation of South Pacific. 
The play was staaed as if it 
were in a mental ward. 

In an interview with Hiatus, 
Ms. Boprt spoke about the 
production of 19' I, its 
structure and development, 
and why she has pursued it. 

Hiatus: You're doilll work 
where you didn't actuaUy start 
with a finished script, but 
made it up as you went along? 

Ann Bogart: Yeah , that's 
what 1951 is, and l'tIe done 
that, actwally, quite a lot in the 
past. In a way, it's working in the 
way dancers work, because 
dancers or also filmmakers don't 
start with a play, they'll start 
with an idea, and they'll bWld on 

t's Ann Bogar 

that. Maybe the filmmaker will 
write a script, but also the dancer 
will start {rom ideas and develop 
it as it goes along. 

H.: Your use of the editing 
room - that's like a central 
setting in your play, isn't it? 

A.B.: Well, here's the thing 
- it is. What the a~ience will 
su is JOmething in between a film 
studio and an aikin, room. 
What I mean by that is that there 
won't be any cameras present. 
but the set is Wee a film srwdio. 
with the catwalks, and also I, 
undergraduate actors who are 
playing what we call 
technicians. We call them the 
unit, and they'll be running 
aTound much as a film crew will 
do. Nine gTads.a~ actors pia, 
actors on a film set who are 
playing characters from the eaTly 
' 'os. inmlved in the Howe 
Unamerican Activities hearings. 
So )'OU surt of see the action of the 
'50s thTough the framework of as 
though it is being filmed . 

It is an editing room also, in 
the way that, if )'OU'tIe ever gone 
into an editing Toom_ .. )'OU'1l 
watch how things are talcen 
apart. A JCene will be tried {rom 
the middle, )'OU'II try different 
shots of it, )'OU can try to put it 
together in what the, call a 
montage. Similarly, the wa, 
we'Te creating 1951 is as though 
it's being put together. You will 
see a scene done from the middle, 
a scene Tepeated, and a scene in 
juxtaposition with something 
else, which then changes its 
meaning. 

One of the reasons we're using 
the film image is because the 
people, the characters that are on 
stage, are all HoU,wood actors, 
saeenwriters, columnists, people 
like Lillian Helman, La", 
Parks, Howard H",hes, Elia 
Katan, 1..«. ] . Cobb, Sterling 
Ha,den , Louella Parsons, 
Uonell Standanf, A", Rand, 
these people all had to do, in one 
way or another, with the film 
industry. That's one reason for 
wing the film framework .

H.: People within the 
communication department 
here are interested in this idea 
of how history as a cultural 
memory is passed on, and 
how power is used to suppress 
versions of history, and art. 

A.B.: Yeah, well, 1 don't 
think I'm the only one of m, 
generation of American artists 
who feel a certain emptiness . .. 
that has to do with a lack of 
tTadition. 1 don't mean tTadition 
dating back to the 19th century, I 
mean tTadition dating back 20 
yeaTS. There's this gap, and)lOU 
can 'Aer:Y deaTI, put )'OUT finger 
on it because there's something 
that has not been passed on. I 
had alwa,s read about the '3Of, 
and alwa:p was my excited by 
the work of the group theatre, the 
theatre project. AU of these 
people were working, they 
beliewd in somnhing, and the,

period to the communist pan" 
becatue that was the one that was

HIATUS 
B-or6, La Jolla, CA 92093 

2 H iatuS March 6, 1986 

Contents 
Cover: Ann Bogart'sI9SI 
is the pride of UCSD's 
Theatre in the MakinK 
series; the Celebration of 
Women Artists Kets some 
press on p.3; and GoinKs 
On has p.4. 

This Hiatus is dedicated 
to Henri the waiter. 

French frenzied 
How do )IOU describe this in wordsl 
You don'c in a family magarine. 

You pry off a little corner with your fork - fresh whipped cream, 
blueberries, strawberries, delicate custard, flaky, melting on-contact 
pastry crust. It's chocolate like chocolate was meant to be; exploding your 
senses on contact with the tongue. Chocolate just sweet enough, and so 
rich, it deserves to only be mentioned by name with a smooth and delicate, 
yet lusty French accent - chocolate. As if it hasn't already exceeded the 
limits of decency - add a dash of rum, a sugar glaze, cafe au lait ... add 
dinner and a bottle of wine. 

Contrary to the opinion of the makers of Lean Cuisine, French food is 
not cheesy mush. It is a masterful dance of delicate aromas, textures and 
flavors in the nose and mouth. Here the French Pastry Shopexcells. Their 
scampi burst with buttery shrimp flavor and just enough garlic to leave 
you drooling. Yellowtail (a California fish) is wrapped in paper with 
tomatoes and zucchini and a pinch of spice which are all baked to a juicy 
perfection. The fish even comes with peas which somehow taste 
miraculously dissimilar to the garden variety guinea pig pellets that 
everyone learns to hate - they're wonderful. 

The fettucini with smoked salmon will leave you wondering if pasta is 
really Italian. We're talk in" real food . 

Relax, lean back, twirl your wine glass, drink heartily in mouthfuls, not 
sips. This is the kind of eating the McDonald's generation has never 
learned how to apprecitate. French food not French fried. 

From the street, the French Pastry Shop resembles its name and it is a 
pastry shop (and oh what a pastry shop). It occupies the comer of a small 
business complex and doesn't look like it's got much personality. But 
walking inside is like stepping into Paris. The cakes, cookies, croissants 
and pastries are breathtaking. On the walls are home-made bread 
sculptures and racks of fresh-baked (daily) $1 .00 baguettes and loaves of 
bread. 

But somehow buying these delicacies "to go" is a big mistake. The 
French speaking employees are downright charming and the service is far 
better than you would ever expect at San Diego's snootiest 
establishments. (This is not a good place for a man to take a date if he's 
insecure about his masculinity. Women here are bound to swoon for the 
waiters.) 
The French Pastry Shop is located at 5550 La Jolla Blvd.

What is "women's art"? 

The phrase implies to most a 
political statement, possibly a 
euphemism for a lesbian-
feminist message. As plans 
unfolded for the second 
annual Celebration of 
Women ArtiSts, which 
opened Tuesday at the Chc! 
Cafe, the c oncept of 
"women's art" sparked a 
discussion among feminists, 
artists - both male and 
female - and pretty much

anyone who heard that the 
Women's Resource Center 
was sponsoring a women's art 
festival. 

Was it exclusionary? Was it 
lesbian-oriented? Must a piece 
carry a feminist message to be 
considered women's art? A 
number of artists were 
reluctant to enter in the show 
because they felt their work 
was not "feminist enough." 
And if the show excluded 
men, could that be con-
demned? Perhaps it could, on 
the grounds that the public 
will still fail to recognize 
women artists so long as a 
man's work is present to 
distract the eye.

Grayson is anxious to clarify 
that the show does not seek to 
exclude men. 

"The point is to display 
pieces by or about women. 
There are two male 
performance artists in the 
show; their pieces address 
women's issues, but not all the 
other pieces necessarily do, 
because we make a statement 
just by, creating and showing 
our work, as women. 

"We're exploring the 
female artist-muse . the 
divided woman and the search 
for wholeness. We want to 
define feminist in such a way 
that it won't offend people; a 
lot of people think of man-
hating, but I think it's about

love , about a £firming 
ourselves as people without 
having to define that in terms 
of men's accomplishments." 

All ideology aside, 
Grayson, bassist Mary 
MacQueen, and the show's 
other organizers have 
assembled a collection of 
extraordinary works in a 
number of media - works of 
perception, portent, beauty 
and wit. 

A prevalent theme is the 
whole world as artist's world , 
from an anthropoligicalor or 
ecolog ical viewpoint . 
Catherine Chambers' "Many 
Tribe Scroll" (oil on bark) 
portrays the glyphs for life, 
birth and re!leneration of 

A collection of raku and 
saggar-fired Landscape Vases 
complement's MacQueen's 
Merrie Windes Ensemble, a 
contemporary classical 
composition foe bass and 
recorders that addresses 
ecological conservation. 

"I think the environmental 
issues is also a women's issues; 
whether it be conditioned or 
inherent , women have 
traditionally been the 
nurturers. We have a closer 
bond with the earth through 
the Mother Earth metaphor." 

"En Junta," a performance 
conceived by literature senior 
Canela JaramUlo, addresses 
racism and other di visions 
among women, topics which 
she hopes will be opened for 
discussion by the show.
