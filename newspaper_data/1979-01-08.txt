Bank of America as lost a 
customer. 

Following its Oct.ll decision 
not to invest dollars in banks 
makin, loans to the South 
African government, the Asso-
ciated Students of San Diego 
State University recently 
withdrew more than $1 million 
in cash reserves from the Bank 
of America. 

This withdrawal could cost 
SDSU's AS as much as $30,000 
in lost interest this year. 

Craig Jones, SDSU's lobbyist 
in Sacramento, has called the 
fund re$erve " far and 
away the biggest" 'of any 
campus in the California state 

. college system. The student 
treasury at SDSU is also larger 
than most c~l!!puses in the 

University of California 
system. 

According to an SDSU press 
release, its AS controls a $2.5 
million annual budget. In 
addition, their reserves total 
morE' than $500,000, and their 
average investment balance 
exceeds $1 million. 

Rob DeKoven , ASSDSU 
executive vice president, said 
the California State Student 
Association passed a resolution 
last June encouraging all 
student governments in the 
system to boycott banks with 
investments in South Africa. 

"The government's apart-
heid policy extends to edu-
cation in South Africa," ac-
cording to ASSDSU President 
Steve Glazer . "Non-white 
students must pay school fees 
and a share of their book 

expense not charged to white 
students. Non-whites must 
attend separate schools re-
garded as inferior to the system 
provided for whites as evi-
denced in the lower require-
ments for teachers and over-
crowding of classrooms." 

"We do not want to invest our 
dollars into South Africa, 
because we are aware of the. 
oppressi ve situation," said 
DeKoven. 

SDSU's AS made its decision 
late last year to divest , despite 
Bank of America's effort to 
"explain" the situation, said 
DeKoven . Students "over-
whelmingly supported" the AS' 
action, an opinion poll taken in 
November revealed.

Paul Saltm-an One of 
Three-Finalists for 
Te*as P sittOfl 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate News Editor 

Paul Saltman, vice-chan-
cellor for academic affairs at 
UCSD, is one of three finalists 
for the presidency of the 
University of Texas (UT) at 
Austin. 

Saltman flew to Texas last 
week and was interviewed by a 
UT search committee, which 
included two students. Laura 
Tuma, administration reporter 
for The Texan, the UT student 
newspaper, told The Guardian 
that Saltman sufficiently 

impressed the UT Regents 
enough to delay the a ppoint-
ment of a president from last 
Saturday to February 8 or 9, the 
date of the next UT Regents' 
meeting. 

Saitman is an important 
contender for the post, Tuma 
said, but not the favorite. That 
position belongs to Peter 
Flawn, thirty years a professor 
and administrator in the UT 
system. Also vying for the 
presidency is Wayne Uoltzman, 
director of the Hogg Founda-
tion for Mental Health, an 
Austin-based non - profit 
corporation. 

cation of candidates from 
across the nation, then 
interviewed ix of them, 
including the three finalists. 

Saltman may suffer in the 
selection process because of his 
reputation for independence. 
The Austin American-States-
man . yesterday quoted an 
unidentified member of the UT 
search committee as saying 
that Saltman may be "too 
honest and too above board" for 
the job. , 

The current UT President, 
Lorene Rogers, retiring at 65 
was appointed because the 
Regents thought she would be 
malleable, according to Tuma.

Part of the process that is 

working toward the possible 
appointment of Paul Saltman 
as President of the University 
of Texas has involved AS 
President John Jenkel in an 
expenditure of discretionary 
funds. 

Jenkel, vacationing in South 
Lake Tahoe with his family 
after Chtistmas, was asked by 
students on the UT search 
committee to discuss Salt-
man's record and reputation at 
UCSD. The students had a Jan. 
2 deadline. 

Jenkel expended $97 from his 
Executive Account, a none-

for round trip air fare from 
Reno to San Francisco, and a

Francisco.

Shoreline Research Inadequate 
By AnUa Zusman 

Rain can cause more than 
blooming flowers, believes 
Gerry Kuhn, geologist and 
oceanic researcher at Scripps 
Institute. Kuhn, an expert on 
erosion and oceanic destruc-
tion, foretells a time in the near 
future when huge ocean storms 
will wreak havoc on Cali-
fornia's coastline. 

Kuhn explained that South-
ern California's climate has 
historically gone through very 
distinct periods of precipi-
tation, alternating with periods 
of drought . Previous wet 
periods have lasted approxi-
mately ten years, and were 
characterized by violent ocean 
stonn •. 

In our last wet period, which 
ended in 1934, waves over 30 
feet high were reportedly 
breaking along the coa.t. 
BulldJDgI and hlgbway were 
deatroyed a the tide moved in 
with force. 

Beach citizens tried to swim to 
safety as their streets were 
flooded. 

The Venice and Santa Monica 
piers were torn off and in 
Newport Beach high waves 
carried two houses out to sea. 

"This was not unusual for a 
wet period," stated Kuhn. "One 
1862 storm destroyed one 
quarter of all taxable real 
estate in California. And the 
effects of our next big storm 
can be just as dramatic (as the 
1862 storm) . " 

USing historical documents 
and p.'Jotographs from past 
tempests, Kuhn has predicted 
that Southern California 's 
pnwIItt 
end. " It' impossible to know 
how destructive the next wet 
period will be, or exact!)' tten 
it will occur. (But) it can be 
determined from hi.torical 
data that a wet period i.

TRIPOLI - Here in · 
revolutionary, oil-rich Libya, 
as in most Arab countries, the 
most popular public per-
sonality isn't Yasser Arafat of 
the PLO. It is a black 
American, Muhammad Ali. 
From Morocco to Kuwait, the 
"Greatest" is revered almost 
as a hometown hero. And black 
Americans are considered 
brothers in Islam. 

Yet for all the rhetoric on 
both sidel about cloee fraternal 
tiel, visits to tbe Arab world 
reveal the same tblni one Dndl 
in Bedford-Stuyvesant. 
Anacostia or Hunter's Point. So 
many years after the Hon. 
Elijah Mubammad first made 
Islam a powerful force In black 
America, and the Arabs belan 
equaUna Zionism with racism, 
U.S. blacka sUli know very 
little, and seem to care even 
less about the Arab cause. For 
their part, Arabs in America 
and the Mideast seem equally 
unaware that an organized 
black leadership and society 
even exists in America, aside 
from Muhammad Ali and 
Andrew Young. 

The Arabi so far have failed 
to exploit an opportunity to win 
over to their cause a iJ"oup of 
more than 25 million Ameri-
cans who, until recently, 
overwhelmingly supported 
Israel. U.S. blacks - at a time 
when mainstream America 
seems increasingly insensitive 
to their needs - also have made 
little effort to enlist the Arabs' 
growing_ political and already 
immense financial support for 
their cause. 

Micleut dialogue is especially 
noticeable In compariaop to the 
Arabs' diplomatic and poUUcal 
efforts in black Africa, and 
their own lona ties with African 
affairs. Of the Arab League's 21 
members, eilbt - Allerta, 
Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, 
Morocco, Somalia, Sudan and 
Tunisia - are In Africa. Nearly 

100 milUon of the Arab world's 
145 million people Dve on the 
African continent. 

Part of the reason Arabs 
expend so little effort maltlq 
their case to black Americans 
i. that from revolutionary 
Marxi.t. to ortbodox 011 
sbelltba, Arabi don't believe 
their lociety baa • race 

problem - and they find it 
inconceivable that other. could 
Walt so either. 

KinI Khalid of Saudi Arabia, 
for example. seemed leDuinely 
astoniabed at rumors be bad 
barred aU blacks from the 
eilbth Door of the Cleveland 
bMpital wbere be underwent 

(Please lurn &0 pale II) 

Meanwhile in Chicago, in 
Harlem, all across America, 
Black Americans who have 
turned to Islam to assert their 
dignity and self-respect pray 
toward Mecca. Just as millions 
of Arabs consider black 
Americans exempt from their 
denunciation of U.S. " im-
perialism" and support for 
Israel, so for millions of black 
Americans, Moslem and 
Christian alike, Arabs are 
"blood brothers" - sharing 
similar geographical and 
cultural roots. 

While the Arab-American 
dialogue is more intense than 
ever before, benign neglect in 
relations between Arabi and 
Afro-Americans is the rule 
even in the most radical Arab 
states . Libya, for example, has 
recently been receiving a 
steady stream of American 
visitors - ranging from Billy 
Carter to Spiro Agnew. But 
though the Libyans are the 
Arabs most zealous in 
condemning what the official 
news agency here calls 
"racialist, colonialist domina-
tion throughout the world," 
U.S. blacks have played no 
significant role in what the 
Qadafi government calls a 
"Popular Arab-American 
Dialogue." ThIs autumn more 
than 100 American educators, 
lawyers and media per-
sonalities visited Tripoli at the 
invitation of the Libyan 
government. Only two of the 
participant delegates were 
black. 

Midwest vs. West 
Not All Midwesterners are Farmers, 

As Not All Californians Surf 
By Kalby Huffer 

S,-" Wrlcer 
One afternoon last October 

while driving to class I picked 
up a hitch-hiking grad student. 
As we headed toward campus 
he initiated our conversation, 
beginning with the classical 
question, "Where are you 
from?" 

I replied offhandedly that I 
was from Ohio. 

Suddenly his calm demeanor 
turned to animation. "Wait!" 
he cried. "Don't tell me - I'll 
bet you' re from Dayton!" 

I must admit that I was a bit 

In recent years, Afro-
Americans and Arabs in-
creasingly have had something 
else in common - distrust of 
Israel and its supporters in the 
United States . As tensions have 
grown between black and 
Jewish Americans, from the 
Crown Heights section of 
Brooklyn to the Supreme Court 
chambers where the Bakke 
case was argued, Afro-
Americans have experienced 
growing sympathy for the 
Arabs, especially for Pales-
ti nians displaced by Israeli 
expansion. 

The omission of an Afro-
American component in the

'retain my composure , I 
responded, "You're right. But 
how did you know I was from

With a rather smug smile, he 
replied, "Well, I figured if you 
were from the Midwest, the 
worst possible place to come 
from would be Dayton, Ohio." 

I decided not to take his 
comments as a personal 
affront. Arter all, I had heard 
similar remarks many times 
before. But the incident made 
me think. 

One of my conclusions was 
that the students I have run 
across in California are often 
grossly misinformed about the 
faraway lands east of the 
Mississippi. And Midwestern 
views of the west coast are, at 
best, often the products of a 
social hysteria beset with 
untruths. 

Not every Californian 
assumes that the only 
diversions available in the 
Midwest are picking corn and 
swatting mosquitos. And not all 
Midwesterners believe that 
Californians divide their time 
between religious cults and 
drugs. But the theories are 
quite popular. 

We, as residents of a 
particular location, tend to be 
fiercely defensive a.bout where 
we live. The West Coast and the 
Midwest are no exceptions. 

Now I'll be the first to admit 
that the Midwest lacks an 
ocean , consistently sunny 
skies, and eucalyptus trees. But 
a lack of beaches, rrequent rain 
(or snow) , and oak trees do not 
breed illiterate, uncultured 
barbarians. Midwesterners do 
read Classics, watch TV, take 
piano lessons, 80 to concerts, 
drink Pepsi, and do all the other 
wonderfully American things 
that Californians do. True, few 
can surf. 

Midwesterners tend to cling 
to old beliefs longer and accept 
new Ideas more slowly than do 
Californians. "Healtb food" 
has not become the norm in the 
Midwest yet . Small cars are 
still hardly visible on the roads. 

........ -." ... "" ..... " ... . .. ".,,. ~J11 ., 

But 18-year-olds can legally 
drlng alcoholic beverages in 
some Midwestern states, and 
the question of barring 
homosexuals from teaching 
has not yet been put on a 
Midwestern ballot. 

Politically, the Midwest 
cannot be charged as inactive. 
True, it does not boast any 
Reagans or Browns, but it has 
made a name for itself witb 
such limelight figures as 
Wayne Hayes and Dennis 
Kucinich . And how many 
American presidents can you 
name from the West Coast? 

California cannot take all the 
credit for social lunatics and 
deviants. Religious cults may 
have made a name for 
themselves on the West Coast, 
but the Ku Klux Klan remains 
most prosperous in such states 
as Indiana and Ohio. Hare 
Krishna representatives not 
only roam the sidewalks of 
UCLA but invade the campus at 
Ohio State University as well. 

Too many people correlate 
crime with such cities as Los 
Angeles and San Clemente. 
But, come on, let's give credit 
where it's due. I dare anyone to 
walk alone at night in 
Cleveland, Louisville, Detroit, 
or any other of a number of 
cities In the Midwest. Their 
police forces don't sit around 
card tables drinking beer and 
playing poker all day. 

Californians often charge the 
Midwest with being too 
culturally homogeneous. True, 
I have not run across many 
Spanish-speaking citizens in 
my home town. But Americans 
as a whole are not lured to the 
Midwest as they are ' to the 
coast (not enough beaches, I 
suppose). Stili, white suburbias 
exist across the country, 
interspersed with pocJtets of 
poverty and inner-city ghett08.

BANGKOK. Thailand (AP) 
- Pro-Hanoi Cambodian rebels 
claimed they "totally liber-
ated" the capital of Phnom 
Penh Sunday, overthrew 
Premelr Pol Pot and grabbed 
control of almost all of 
Cambodia. 

Vietnam radio and the Soviet · 
News agency Tass, both 
quoting the insurgents' SPK 
news agency, also said Phnom 
Penh had fallen. 

Analysts in Bangkok said the 
offensive took two weeks. The 
reports that Phnom Penh had 
been captured by the Cam-
bodian rebels could not be 
independently confirmed. 

In Moscow, in an unusually 
swift response, Tass said the 
" liberation" of Phnom Penh 
would cause "profound 
satisfaction and joy by millions 
of people" in the world. The 
dispatch said the Cambodian 
government had pursued "a 
barbarous policy of genocide 
against the Kampuchean 
people. " It added "the birth of 
an independent and free 
Kampuchea will be an 
important factor for peace and 
stability in Southeast Asia ." 
Kampuchea is the official name 
of Cambodia. 

President Carter, still in 
Guadeloupe after a four-power 
Western summit, declined to 
answer reporters' questions 
about Cambodia, but did say he 
had heard Phnom Penh had 
rallen. 

In Washington, JackCannon, 
State Department spokesman 
for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, said U.S . officials have 
not yet received confirmation 
of the rebel victory . 

"Our position has been that 
Vietnam ' intervention in 
Cambodia is totally unjustified 
and Vietnam should remove its 
forces," Cannon said. 

The rebel communique , 
released in Bangkok, said: 
" After annihilating or 
disintegrating the main force 
divisions of the Pol Pot-Ieng 
Sary army and smashing the 
outer defense ring of the 
enemy, the revolutionary 
armed forces of Kampuchea 
Cambodia in coordination with 
the people entered Phnom Penh 
from various directions." 

The communique said the 
rebels took the capital city at 
12 : 30 p . m., forciJ\g the 
complete collapse of the 
government of Pol Pot and his 
deputy premier, Ieng S~ry.

Rx rugs May Have Visual Effects, Too 
pioD 

Sdnee dl .... 
"Recreatio al drugs," .It 

seems, may not be the only ones 
which noticeably affect visual 
perception. Many drugs 
commonly prescribed by 
doctors to cure various 
illnesses have been found to be 
the causes of hallucinations, 
double vision, dilated pupils 
and irritation of the eyes. 

Codeine, for example, a 
derivative of the more potent 
drug morphine and one of the 
active ingredients in some 
cough remedies, may cause 
nearsightedness in some 

people. Double vision can result 
from the use of oral con-
traceptives and tranquilizers 
such as Valium and Li brium. A 
wide variety of vision problems 
have been associated with the 
use of Benadryl, an antihls-
timine. Patients using this drug 
have reported such side effects 
as hallucinations, double 
vision, decreased tolerance for 
contact lenses and involuntary 
rapid movement of the 
eyeballs. 

Not only drugs sold by 
prescription, but some which 
are marketed "over-the-
counter" are also being 

carefully examined as possible 
causes of vision problems. For 
instance, the active ingredient 
in non-aspirin painkillers such 
as Tylenol and Datril, 
acetaminophen, can cause the 
user's pupils to enlarge, his 
eyes to become irritated and 
everything he sees to be colored 
with a faint yellow tinge. 

The Food and Drug Admin· 
istration (FDA) organized a 
special department to study the 
effects of drugs on the eye. The 
National Registry of Possible 
Drug·Induced Ocular Side 
ECCects, as it is called officially, 
is the first branch of the FDA to 

concentrate on gathering 
information about the effects of 
drugs on a single organ. Since 
its establishment two years 
ago, almost 2,000 cases of 
"possible drug-induced ocular 
side errects" have been 
recorded by the Registry. 

One of the most serious side 
eCCects studied by the Registry 
is that of increased pressure 
within the eye. Epinephrine 
(adrenaline) is one drug which 
is known to produce this effect. 
Patients who have glaucoma, a 
disease which causes increased 
pressure within the eye and 
which leads to blindness, are

greatly threatened by the 
added pressure of this side 
effect. 

The sedative chloral hydrate 
has been shown to cause miosis 
- an excessive contraction of 
the pupil - and drooping 
eyelids. Overdoses of this drug 
have been reported to result in 
"Lillipution hallucinations," a 
vision problem in which the 
patient perceives objects as 
being smaller than they really 
are. 

Even vitamin A, the 
chemical so orten associated 
with good vision, has been 
linked to vision problems. Too 
much of the fat-soluble vitamin 
can lead to problems with color 
vision, a yellow discoloration of 
the eyelids and, in some cases, 
can cause "crossed" eyes. 
These effects have been 
observed to be more common in 
young children than in adults. 

According to the Registry, if 
a patient suffers any problems 
caused directly by the use of 
some medicine, the chances 
are good that the difficulties 
will end when the medication is 
stopped.

3rd-Year Med Students Practicing on Us 
By DaD S&, Claire Bacon

The first time I telephoned 

Rosa, she said, "HI Dail. Could 
you call me back In a half hour? 
I have a patient here that ' s 
overdosed. Bye." 

" Sure ... " , I said slowly , 
somewhat surprlzed. My voice 
trailed of(. She had already 
hung up. Soon after that phone 
call I spent a day with her. I. 
then found that for Rosa 
treating overdosed patients 
wasn' t all that unusual. As a 
matter of fact Rosa is likely to 
be found taking care of diabetic 
seizures and patients afmcted 
with meningitis , leukemia , 
cirrosis or multiple sclerosis. 

Rosa Rodriguez is a third 
year medical student at UCSD 
School of Medicine. All third 
year students are required to 
work four weeks l"\ Psychiatry, 
four weeks in Neurology and 12 
weeks In Medicine, Surgery 
and Obstetrics in University 
Hospital (UH) , or the Veterans 
Hospital. Rosa is doing her 
clerkship In Medicine at UH. 
" In Medicine," Rosa explains, 
"you get to see a lot. We're 
assigned three patients with an 
intern. Mainly we do whatever 
a physician does , except we're 
supervised. " 

" Is this the first time you've 
ever treated people?" [ in-
quired. 

"That's what third year is all 
about," Rosa smiled. " [n third 
year you actually treat people 
for the first time in your 

medical training. In the first 
year yo'u relearn all- your 
biochemistry, molecular and 
cellular biology, etc. In the 
second year you do more of that 
and see patients with doctors. 
But you're not actually treating 
them, " she said.

asked . " Not r"~ " v .. ;l n ~w('rl'd 
Rosa. " I think it boils down to 
the old thing where the doctors 
feel . ' [ went through this when I 
was in training , now it's your

have a lot of say in who teaches 
us."

room off from the nurse 's 
station. This was the interns/ 
med students/nurses quarters. 
The camaraderie of the group 
was obvious. One nurse was 
busy organizing a potluck for 
the doctors and nurses on 
tomorrow's shift. . 

.. Are there any problems 
with doctor/nurse relation-
ships? " [ asked. 

" Here, there 's real team 
cooperation," Rosa said . 
" Doctors have to realize that 
the nurse is an asset, not a 
liabiUty. They are the ones that 
have the continual contact with 
the patients 80 they ' re more 
aware of changes in the pa-
tient's condition than we are," 
she said. 
Steven Puentes , another 

third year student joined us. 
" God ," he yawned , " I ' m 
tired!" 

I caught Rosa's eye. We both 
laughed. "00 ~ students have 

"That's true." Steve agreed. 
.. Arter every clerkship we do an 
evaluation of the proctor (a 
doctor in the uni t). These 
evaluations carry a lot of 
weight. There was a doctor in 
neurology that a lot of us felt 
wasn't a good proctor. He was a 
good doctor but he couldn 't 
teach. That came out in our 
evaluations . He 's not proc-
toring anymore," Steve said. 

" University Hospital is a 
teaching hospital and we' re 
here to be taught ," Rosa 
commented . " Eventually 
we ' re going to be the ones

A spokesman for tbe U.S. Ski others. 

With ski areas open and 
plenty of snow in the mountains 
this season, th()usands of skiers 
are heading for the slopes -
and the inevitable sprains, 
breaks and bruises. But thanks 
to a 26-year-old novice skier, 
whose personal traUCiY led to a 
court rutin, that drastically 
affected the ski industry, most 
skiers this year can expect lots 
more education about the 
hazards of the sport, if not s,!fer 
runs. 

James Sunday has been 
confined to a wheelchair for the 
past five years, surviving only 
with the help of a nurse's aide. 
He was paralyzed from his 
shoulders down on Feb. 10,1974, 
when his ski tip caught on a 
bush hidden by powdery snow 
on a beginner's slope. He took a 
spill and hit his head on a rock. 

Sunday sued the Stratton 
Corporation, operators of the 
Stratton Mountain ski area in 
Vermont, charging that the 

On June 7, 1977, a jury in 
Burlington, Vt., awarded him 
Sl5 million in damages, the 
largest judgement ever in a 
downhill skiing case. The size of 
the sum was enough to touch off 
panic in the ski industry 
nationally. But in addition, 
Judge Wynn Underwood 
handed down an opinion that 
seemed to strip ski area 
operators of their traditional 
defense against accidents. 

Historically, courts around 
the country ha ve rejected 
claims similar to Sunday's, 
reasoning that people who take 
part in potentially dangerous 
sports submit willingly to the 
hazards. The legal doctrine of 
volenti non fit injuria - no 
injury is done to one who 
consents - was so well es-
tablishecl that only a tiny 

"One who partakes in the 
sport of skiing," Judge Under-
wood wrote, .. accepts the 
dangers that inhere in it only 
insofar as they are obvious and 
necessary." A skier could sue 
for damages, he ruled, if .the 
operator "fails to exercise 
reasonable care to protect him 
agamst the danger." 

Judge Underwood noted that 
"The ski industry changed 
dramatically" over the years. 
Ski area operators contend that 
their trails ' ' have been' 
groomed and manicured to the 
point where they approximate 
a golf course fairway," ob-
served the judge, an avid skier 
himself . Consequently, he 
concluded, "the ski area 
operator can no longer, under 
all circumstances, hide behind 
the doctrine of volenti non fit 

Association in Denver says 
many ski areas have seen their 
insurance rates double and 
triple as a result of the decision, 
and those costs are being 
paS$ed on to skiers in higher lift 
ticket prices ... For every $14 lift 
ticket, at least $3 is going to pay 
for insurance." he said. 

Consequently, the situation 
also set off a scramble across 
the country for St2 •• ) legislation 
that would alter the effects of 
the court opinion. 

The National Ski Areas 
Association drafted a model 
code which was distributed to 
friendly lawmakers in every 
state with a ski area. It was 
based on the industry's view 
that its proper role was to get 
skiers up the mountain safely 
but that after that they were 
strictly on their own. 

The code required skiers to 
acknowledge skiing as haz-

injuria." ardous, to know and respect the 
The decision has touched off limitations of their own abil-

ities, to heed warnings and 

Legislators responded 
promptly. By last summer, 
what the industry calls "skier 
safety legislation" was in 
various stages of introduction 
or completion in almost every 
state where there is skiing. 

Vermont, Maine, New Hamp-
shire and New Mexico passed 
laws following the NSAA 
model. California amended Its 
penal code to require skiers to 
observe boundaries and 
warnings. Other provisions 
sought by the industry are up 
for consideration this year. 

Part of tlle rush to pass such 
laws is explained by the fear of 
economic repercussions if ski 
areas close. When Vermont 
passed its law last January, 11 
of the 26 areas in that state had 
been notified that their in-
surance would be cancelled if 
the measure was not approved. 
One ski area had actually 
closed and five others had 
announced they would do so 
without insurance.

blood count had decreased. You

glistening, "I was so happy I 
jumped up and down and 
screamed. There are a lot of 
rewards. " 

"There's a feeling you get,

patients and rinding out what's

everything worth, it. Some 
people work their whole life and 
never achieve that." 

That evening I accompanied 
Rosa on her rounds. During the 
night, one of Rosa's patients 
had a seizure. A medical team, 
including Rosa, attended her. 
After the seizure was arrested 
Rosa stayed with her patient. I 
watched her as she reassured 
the patient, then motioned the 
patient's anxious family in the 
room. She began to explain to 
them what had hap~ened . As I 
stood there watchmg in the 
doorway, I recalled Rosa's 
previous statement about what 
it is to be a doctor. 

" Treating people," she said, 
leaning toward me, her eyes 
widening with excitement, 
" treating people ... caring ... 
that's what it 's all about." 

"So phYSically tired ... II 

"We're on call every third 
night," Rosa said, describing a 
third year routine schedule. 
" Once a week we sleep in the 
hospital. You know, I re -
member getting in bed here one 
night at 12 and getting an 
emergency call at four . I was 
back in bed atriveandupatsix . 
Our days begin at seven . There 
are times ." she sighed. " when 
you get so physically tired , it's 
unbelievable ... 

" What do you do the nights 
you're not on call'? " I asked. 
"We're supposed todo readinp 
every night on diseases relating 
to our patients' conditions ," 
Rosa answered. "But therejust 
isn' t time. By the time I get 
home, fix dinner and eat then do 
something to the house I sit 
down to read . But by that time 
I'm so tired I fall asleep on my 
books. I haven't yet been ableto 
get past a few pages without 
falling asleep," she said. 

"Everyone hears about med 
student's fatigue, med students 
being overworked. You hear 
the same things about interns. 

. Do you think that interferes 
with patient care'?" I asked . 

"Oh no," Rosa said imme-
diately . "The patient is seen by 
three teams of doctors. Our-
selves, the interns and the 
resident. If one person misses 
something the other is sure to 
pick it up," she said. 

We were walking to the 
cafeteria for a quick bite. Rosa 
had night duty that evening. 
"We're off the day after we' re 

• on duty," she continued, "but 
there are write-.ups to do , 
readings on your patients' 
diseases and treatments , 
deciphering of old cases and I 
always check up on my pa-

prepare for. On my 'day off]

"it's just torturing." 

"Well.·' I asked. "can you 
suggest a better way to train

" The training is /good. 
There's just no reason to work

Craft Center Fights 
Funding Reductions 
Relaxation, 'Real World' Skills Emphasized 

By Lyue ReJd-Kiu 
It was student interest that 

created the UCSD Crafts 
Center and student interest that 
has helped it survive to become 
the fine studio arts laboratory it 
is today. . 

Originally planned 81 a 
commuter lounge in 1972, 
members of the pbotography 
and ceramics clubs trans-
formed the building, located 
between the Student Informa-
y'on Center aD(I Bonner Hall, 
into a crafts cent.er. 

Growth and mismanagement 
has cauaed the center to lose 
three separate sources of 
funding. [n 1176, former Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs, 
George Murphy, citing lack of 
management, gave the center a 
3O-day notice to relocate. The 
notice was disregarded upon 
Murpby's unexpected resig-
nation. 

Under the new leadersbip of 
Operations Manager, Ron 
Carlson, the center is now in the 
process of becoming self-
sufficient. 

Registration f~s for classes 

and proceeds from semi-annual 
sales of student and staff art 
currently cover the $44,000 per 
year cost of operations. (Next 
Wednesday , Tbursday and 
Friday, the center will hold it's 
winter sale of gooda.) 

Classes such as yoga, quilt 
matln., ceramics, pbotog-
rapby, woodworking, Jewelry, 
furniture makine and mime 
cost students $25 for nine weeks 
of Instruction and materials. 
Non-studenla pay $50. 

About 250 studen.ts attend the 
classes offered by the Crafla 
Center each quarter. Many 
enroll for recreation as well as 
education. "People come here 
to relax. This Is one of the few 
places on campus where they 
can take an active rather than 
passive role in the learning 
process," says the Center's 
Business Manager, Barbra 
Shreve. 
_ . Are classes at the Crafts 

Center different from those 
offered by the Visual Arts 
Department? "They're slanted 
towards art criticism. We're 
aimed at studio arts and 
producing quality craftsman-

ship," Carlson explains. 
"We like to keep offerings in 

touch witb the real world . 
Courses are offered where 
interest will hold," Carlson 
says: Twice a year the center 
conducts a survey. Students are 
asked what types of courses 
they'd like t see offered. "We 
try to accommodate their needs 
within our capabilities. Last 
spring we bad a lot of requests 
for a course on auto mechanics. 
We held the class tbis fall in a 
parkine lot. Our 'number one' 
request has consistently been 
ceramics," explains Carlson. 

A problem facing the Craft 
Center today is space. A 
request has been made for 
expansion of the Center's 
facilities . Carlson says two 
adjitional classrooms are 
needed to completely house the 
program as it currently exists. 

The Craft Center is staffed by 
both student and non-student 
employees. 

Registration for winter craft 
classes will be held January 8 
from 10 am to 6 pm and January 
9-12 from 10 am to 4: 30 pm.

After paying over Sl00 per day

I'm happy to inform that 
there Is. If you are one of the

Revelle Rails Fixed 
While students enjoyed their 

Christmas vacations, busy 
maintenance crews made 
needed improvements in the 
Revelle residence halls and 
cafeteria. In Argo and Blake 
Halls, new metal railings were 
i nsta lied, rep I a ci ng th e 
originals that had begun to 
crumble, dropping baseball-
sized chunks of concrete to the 
walkways below. 

Although no one. was hit, 
student safety required the 
railings be replaced, not just 
repaired. Worries that work 
delayed by unexpected rains 

would not be finished proved 
unfounded; returning students 
moved back in unfettered by 
scaffolding or heavy equip-
ment. 

New chairs and tables in 
Revelle Cafeteria should ser 
to improve its dining en-
vironme nt. However , the 
newness of the tables is 
somewh at illusionary . What 
the tables in fact received is a 
new woodgrain formica 
layed over the original ta 
bottoms. Nevertheless, t 
chairs really are as new as they 
look.

Becauae it is frequently wiDdy 
and overcast in the La Jolla 
area, the IfOUP travels to Otay 
to practice. The airport there 
provides all the necessary 
equipment and instructors for 
Inexperienced divers. Present-
ly .. a first jump costs $54, which 
covers equipment and a day's 
instruction. If the club con-
tinuea to expand, members will 
be able to get a cost discount on 
group excursions. 

ROtIenblatt hopes to attract 
students from all the UCSD 
«;olleges. "If the ,roup con-
tinues to draw a large number 
of new members, we might be 
able to compete against other 
skydiving organizations," said 
Rosenblatt. 

Rosenblatt baa already 
competed nationaUy. In 1m, 
he and Art Tucker, a well-
ltnown sky-diver wbo helped 
Rosenblatt start UCSD's IrouP, 
placed third in national com-
petition. They did not compete 
in 1m, but hope to do so this 
year. 

Rosenb[att explained that 
there are three levels of 
skydiving competition. Ac-
curacy junipin, tests your 
ability to land on a 10 cm. disk 
after jumping from 6,000 feet. 
Tucker placed third nationally 
in this category. Style jumping 
is a race against time In which 
the jumper must maneuver 
himself to follow a certain route 
from plane to ground. 

"The most difficult type of 
competition is RW (Relative 

Work)," Roaenblatt explained. 
In this competition, POUPi of 
jumpers dive simultaneously 
and form patterna while fallinl. 

"RW i. the moat dangerous 
part of skydiving," commented 
Rosenblatt. "Accidents are 
frequent and are often fatal." 
Divers jump at 15,000 feet and 
fall at a rate of 90 m.p.h. While 
in the air, they join and form 
patterns by holdin, onto each 
others arms and legs. 

Rosenblatt questioned 
whether UCSD could ever 
participate in this type of 
competition. "Money is an 
inhibiting factor. A good 
parachute can cost $1000." He 
hopes to get funding from 
Recreation funds, but right 
now, "It is very tentative."

It is true, compared to a week in 
Mazatlan, Africa is expensive. 
But don't be fooled by the travel

approximately two quarters of

the air fare . The most ex-
pensive way is to buy a regular 
economy fare round trip ticket. 
Most travelers see this price 
($1,800) and settle for Mazat-
Ian after all. Of course, if the 
money is there, it's great, 
because this ticket is good for a

UCSD Football: Students Boot It 
By PhlUp Soreae. 

The year-was 1911. It wu a 
Saturday afternoon. Both 
teams were loing through,their 
various warm-up drills, 
readying themselves for the 
Big Game: quarterbacks were 
loosening up their arms; 
receivers were jOlling through 
their pass patterns; punters 
were spiraling footballs 
through the air. 

1969 Student No Vote on Giving 
Scholarships Killed Football Program 

diately dropped, twenty bad 
had no previous experience, 
and only four.teen had lettered 
in high school football . 

A second problem, wbich was 
related to the small turnout, 
was the demanding college 
curriculum. Students felt that 
with the rigid academic load 
they were required to take, they 
simply could not afford to give 
up the time needed to play 
football . Forbes feels that a 
balance between sports and 
academic requirements has 
always been a problem at 
UCSD. 

Let's see .. . Saturday after-
nooD, footballs, Big Game. 
Must be USC vs. UCLA, righ\? 
Wrong. It's UCSD vs. Cal Tech, 
not in a battle of wits, but in a 
battle of brawn - an official 
intercollegiate football aame at 
UCSD. 

Tbough few people today are 
aware of it, there -was at one 
time an intercolteliate football 
program here at our university. 
The team was composed of 
Revelle students (Revelle was 
the only campus at the time), 
most of whom lacked size and 
experience. According to P.E. 
department member Frank 
Vitale, some hadn't even 
played hjgh school football 
before trying out Cor and 
making the UCSD team. 

There were four assistant 
coaches alonl with (the late) 
Walt Hackett, who was a line 
coach for the San Diego 
Chargers before accepting the 
job as bead coach for the UCSD 
team. 

The team practiced at an old . 
Marine Corps Recruiting 
Depot, and played their games 
on the field which is today part 

of the Warren College campus. 
The conditions at tbis field were 
"less than Ideal", according to 
Ted Forbes, now a faculty 
member in the P.E. Dept. who 
was Dean oC Students at the 
time. 

"I remember one game," 
Forbes said, "when the wind 
was so strong that the punter 
actually lost yards on one of his 

football . 
This loss culminated a bit-

terly frustrating season for 
Hackett's twenty-five plus 
member team. The team had 
gone 0-8, and both players and 
coaches felt that if they had any 
hopes of becoming a competi-
tive team, some improvements 
needed to be made in the 
footba II program . Tbese 

scholarsbips", the students 
voted against the proposal by a 
4-1 mar:gin , according to 
Howard Hunt, Chairman of the 
Physical Education Depart-
ment. 

"This said that the student 
body at that time did not want to 
give preferential treatment for 
atbletes, to which I also 
concurred," said Hunt, who 

"I remember one game," Forbes said, "when the wind 
was 50 strong that the punter actually lost yards on 
one of his kicks." . 
kicks." 
Record Brealdn, Performance 

The team competed in the 
NCAA Division II against such 
teams as Cal Lutheran, Azusa 
Pacific, and USD. Cal Tech also 
happened to be on UCSD's 
regular season schedule. UCSD 
went into the Cal Tech game, 
their last of the season, with a 
perfect 0-7 mark. Cal Tech had 
the dubious distinction of 
having lost the last thirty-three 
consecutive games it had 
played. 

In what turned out to be a 
well-fought battle, UCSD ended 
up on the losing end, 34-31, 
enabling the ' school to receive 
national coverage of a different 
sort - this tilne in the world of 

improvements coul~ come only 
through -the granting of finan-
cial aid and scholarships, two 
necessary tools for any college 
coach who hopes to field a 
respectable team. 

Students Decide 
According to Forbes, the 

students at the time were 
questioning the school 's 
budget. More money for an 
upgraded football team would 
mean an increase in their 
registration fees. Instead of 
making an Individual decision, 
the Chancellor opted to let the 
students decide the matter. A 
committee was formed and a 
referendum was drawn up. 

To the question, "Would you 
approve the granting of athletic 

was in charge of scheduling the 
games for UCSD 

Though undoubtedly a key 
factor, this decision by the 
students was not the only thing 
responsible for bringing about 
an end to the Intercollegiate 
football program at UCSD . 
There were other problems. 

One had to do with numbers 
- there just weren't enough 
people who were willing or who 
had the desire to participate in 
an extra-curricular activity. 

This problem apparently was 
not unique to the '68 team. 
During the spring of 1972, when 
Vitale tried to start up another 
team, oC the fifty students who 
attended the spring practice at 
the beginning, fifteen imme-

"We have never been able to 
find a compromise between 
sports and academics here at 
UCSD, the way Berkeley and 
UCLA nave," he said. 

A third problem was the cost 
involved in running and main-
taining a football program. 
Vitale, who wrote upa financial 
report covering such Items as 
transportation and equipment 
for the team, found that the 
total came to approximately 
$44,000 for an 8-game season. 

When it was suggested that 
perhaps a football program, . 
though costly, could eventually 
support itself through student 
involvement and community 
support, it was Forbes wbo 
noted that "very few football 
teams make money, and less 
break even." He cited Ohio 
State as an example. Even with 
the staggering support and ' 
nationwide exposure it gets, 
their football program still lost

Outdoor Recreation Program a Natural 
By Karen Hunter 

Sports Edilor • 
For people who like to take 

trips to new places, work with 
nature and themselves, and 
learn something while tbey're 
·having fun, a program exists on 
campus especially for them. 

"It's new, it's exciting, and 
there's a definite need for it," 
remarked Chuck Gormley, 
director of UCSD's new Out· 
door Recreation Program. 

Started last Call, the program 
offers organized outdoor recre-
ation activities (rock Climbing, 
backpacking, cross country 
skiing, etc .), an equipment 
rental service and a leadership 
intern program. 

"The response to ' the pro-
gram has been good so far, with 
a particular[y good repre-
sentation of students and 
staff," commented Gormley, 
who came to UCSD from 
Northern Illinois University 
where he also ran an outdoor 
recreation department . 
" We've had twice as many 

. applicants as we've been able 
to take on trips so far." 

Last quarter groups went 
backpacking to San Jacinto, 
rock Climbing at Joshua Tree 
and canoeing on the Colorado 
River. Upcoming outings are 
planned for cross·country 
Skiing, winter camping and 
backpacking. All trips cost the 
participants a very nominal fee 
that usually includes transpor-
tation, food, instruction and, at 
times, equipment. 

Gormley feels that the out-
door recreation experience i. 

nique". "It gives people a 
Aanee to ,et away from the 

pressures of school or Jobs and 
work to,ether with nature and 

each other for a couple of 
days." 

Trips sponsored by the 
Outdoor Rec Department are 
"geared towards beginners and 
those interested in learning 
leadership. " Gorm[ey stressed 
that the program is meant to be 
a "learning experience ." 
"Before we go on trips we hand 
out information that people 
should know for the trip - types 
of , knots, ideas for keeping 
warm in the winter, or funda-

mentals of outdoor cooking." 
Participants are given the 
chance, therefore, to brush up 
on any skills or ask questions 
before the trip. Gormley and 
other group leaders assist with 
and reinforce the basic con-
cepts while on the trips. 

The Outdoor Recreation 
Program puts out a monthly 
newsletter, FOOTNOTES. This 
bulletin , combined with 
seminars and workshops on 
specific techniques and prob-

\ 

lems, is available to all UCSD 
students and faculty, staff and 
families with Rec Privilege 
cards. 

Gormley has two discussion 
sessions planned for January. 
"Equipment for the Winter 
Backpacker" is slated for 
January 16 from 8: 30 pm t09:30 
pm in the Rec Gym Conference 
Room. On January 30 a sem-
inar entitled, "Choosing the 
Right Cross-Country Ski Equip-
mt!Dt" will be offered in the 
same place at 8: 30 pm. 

A new service that many 
students will find useful and 
economical is the outdoor 
equipment rental program. 

The Recreationa" Athletic 
Department, in conjunction 
with the Outing Club and 
Warren College's Wilderness 
Discovery Program, offers the 
service on a first come, first 
served basis at a very rea-
sODable cost. Among the items 
available are cross-country ski 
equipment, sleeping bags, back 
packs, and car racks. Any full 
time student may sign out 
equipment as may any faculty / 
staff member with a current 
rec privilege card. 

Gormley commented that he 
would be happy to assist any 
group on campus in planning an 
outdoor recreation trip.

score was RAW MEAT 27, 
CHOCOLATE CITY 26 in the 
third annual ANIMAL BOWL 
footbaU classic. 

The game was much closer 
than the score indicates. Much, 
much closer. RAW MEAT (9-
0), winners of 24 straight 
footbaU ,ames over the past 
three seasons, looked to be an 
easy winner as they bolted out 
of the gate with 14 quick points 
on a pair of short TD ,asses 
from QB Rich Foulks to Eric 
Orloff. The rout seemed to be 
on, but somebody forlot to tell

had nashed Into a 14-14 tie. 

RAW MEAT jumped back 
into the lead just before the half 
on a Foulks pass to Kevin 
Benedict, but CC regrouped at 
the break and completely 
dominated defensively during 
the second period as they shut 
out the season-long No. 1 rated 
team. Midway through the half, 
wide receiver Chris WasbiDl-
ton took a razzle-dazzle reverse 
hand-off and then flipped a 43-

yard TD strike to Lamont 
Oliver to tie the score and send .

School Spirit 
At many schools, a college 

football team very often plays a 
significant role in generating 
school spirit. Was this the case 
when UCSD had a football 
team? 

"The spirit wasn ' t dras-
tically different. But any 
intercollegiate team tends to 
add to student life. So I'd say 
that, yes, the climate was 
better," Hunt said. 

Forbes also felt that the spirit 
was somewhat better duriDi 
the days of intercolle,late 
football. He alao noted that the 
team was fairly well supported 
by the students, with at least 
half of the l00&-seat bleacher 
fiUed by UCSD supporters. 

Both Vitale and flunt felt that 
witb a little more aupport 
«(inancially as well as vocaUy) , 
the PJ'Oll'8m could have groWD. 
Tbe vocal support was Dot 
much of a problem. Tbemoney 
was, and Is today, the. maiD 
reason wby a football Pl'Olram 
is noD-exlstent at UCSD. 

"It would cost more for a 
sln,le football team than for the 
other 33 sports (offered at 
UCSD) combined," said

Post 4-6 Holiday · Record 

BI He..,. Dev ..... 
If you happen to meet Co.ch 

Barry Cunningham or any of 
his varsity basketball players, 
don't ask them what they 
thougbt of their Christmas 
vacation. 

The Tritons potted a .W~ 
record over the bolldays, 
making their overall seuon 
record stand at IW-tL. DuriDJ 
one .tretcb the team lost 5 of I 
straipt ,ames. NODe of this 
made for a "Merry" Christina 
or a '''Happy'' New Year. 

The vacation started well 
enougb when the Tritons 
defeated Principia 7"". But 
the problems began for UCSD 
on their December 1.-18 
roadtrip to Seattle. AI soon a 
the team arrived in Wasbiqton 
7 of the 10 players were struck 
witb the Russian flu. The team 
was promptly trounced by 
Seattle Pacific '7-541 and then 
by the University of Pu,el 
Sound 72·3'1. 

Cunningham believes the 
team still hasn't recovered 

from that roadtrip. The Tritons 
are Just now starlinl to regain 
their strenllh and endurance. 
CU,nniqham added that the 
10lles "really hurt our 
confidence." 

After the ~attle trip the 
team returned bome to split a 
pair of pre-Christmas lames. 
The Tritons lost to Stanislaus 
State .2 .. 7 and then defeated 
SpriDi Harbor '7-75. UCSD 
travelled to Texas on 
December 27-21 and lost to SMU 
.... 1 and TCU u.s.. 

Cunninlham cited the poor 
shootin. of hia team for the 
loses. " We·ve.played excellent 
de~ense," the coach said, "but 
we ve been sbootJnl nothing 
but brlclu." UCSD only ahot 
30'Y0 rrom the floor over the 
holidays. "Because we don't 
have the power or the muscle 
we have to shoot over 5O'Y. t~ 
beat a ,ood team," explained 
Cunningham. 

Tblngs have started to 
improve for the Tritons In 
January. UCSD defeated La 

New 1M Season 

Verne 87-711 at home on January 
2. This palt weekend the team 
split a pair of games at the 
Weatmont tournament to win 
the consolation round. UCSD

19 8' s Best Records 
B, Ted Nam. B.rke 

ArtII ..... 
After too mucb debate and 

too little .Ieep, I've come to the 
conclu.ion that the passing 
year wa.n't .ucb a bad one 
after aU, musically speaklna. 
True, there are no iodicatioDi 
that rock and roll will return to 

the grandiose preten.loDi of the 
late Sixties and early Seventies 
(halycon days when we all 
could put on our bead pbones 
and wilb the Viet Nam war out 
of existence), but tbe music 
Itself sbows more than a few 
signs of life wortb considering. 
Here Is my arbitrary list of tbe 

best and wor.t mUlical pr~ 
ducts of the year. 

"'albuml 
1. nil Year'. Model- Elvis 

Costello - A sbarp ear for the 
good lyricaiUne, a penchantfor 
revamping old rock and roll 
ploys into something new all 

Around Town 

Mon., ..... I, 1171 

and Worst 
together, and a unique voice 
that baa the cuttiq edle of a 
buzzsaw. 

2. ne Bride &artpped Bare-
Bryan Ferry - The first of his 
solo albums to equal his efforts 
wltb Roxy Music. Ferry re-
mains, however, an acquired 
taste, an oddity that doesn't sit 
well with tbe average FM 
programmer's pick-bit men-
tality. Wortb investigating. 

3. UK-UK - Easily the best 
"progressive rock" release of 
the year. Tbese guYI avoid the 
washed-out classical pomp or 
preacby lyric syndromes, and 
in general play music meant to 
be listened to, not thrown away. 
Allan Holdsworth guitar work 
is a brilliant plus. 

4. 'I1Ie Grip - Black Arthur 
Blythe - Saxopbonist Blythe 
plays free-style jan with a 
vengence. His Itrong, lyrical 
tone penetrates to the beart of 
the expected cacophoneY and 
etches out moods that fall just 
out of the reach of articulation. 

5. Feels Good to Me - Bill 
Bruford - Drummer Bruford 
prog-rock 1010 effort avoids 
grandstanding and succeeds 
most of the time in getting to the 
point. Performances by Allan 
Holdswortb, Kenny Wheeler on 
trumpet, and bassist Jeff 
Berlin jell together in perhaps 
the best prog-fusion-rock 
mixture. A n~noDiense session 
of inspired blowing. 

6. Electric Guitarist - Jobn 
McLaughlin - a hot and cold 
set, with- guitarist either 
playing as though he were ' 
trying to save his life, or 
holding back in the mistaken 
spirit of group democracy. 
When it's good, though, as on 
his jam with Corea, Stanley 

Clarke, and Jack DeJobnette, it 
smok_ Uke the hottest fire 
you've ever seen. 

7. DoIIbIeTr .... e-Frankee 
Miller - Great voice, ~IO 
material, but.un his beat yet. A 
grea~ future becUDI for this 
man. 

II. eo. 81'(_) - JuUus 
Hempblll - Yo-fo-atonality 
with the spirit of darkest 
Harlem permeatiDl the entire 
affair. Compelling, strident, 
random, and fitfully Iqenlous. 

9. The Cara - Inspired 
dandyism from Boston. Hu-
morous, suave, full of .reat 
hooks suog by one of the great 
non-singers of the Seventies. 
Very interesting. 

10. Vaa Kalen - The art of 
power-rock pitar at Its best. 
Though the bulk of the songs 
are unspeakably lame, and 
siDler David Lee Roth's voice 
barely rises above the level of 
Alvin Lee-esque mannerism, 
Edward Van Halen's guitar 
choops are the best since Leslie 
West. Don't be surprised, 
however, by an early burn-out. 

WorstallMlms 
1. DOD J.an's Reekless 

Dau,.ter - Joni Mitchell -
Amorphously mordant mel~ 
dies, hysterical lyrical nar-
cissism, and selpulcheresque 
sinlina. Mitchell used to be one 
of the few one could depend on. 
No more, and too bad. 

2. Heavy Hones - Jethro 
Tull - or Beatln, a Dead 
Hone. Ian Anderson must have 
taken leave of hiI senses. 

3. Meet me at die Crax - Dirk 
Hamilton - Psychotic word 
rambles from one best for-
gotten. Bum a rag, as was once 
said of filth. 

HISTORY DEPARTMENT _ 
SCHEDULE CHANGES Gospel Choir Here 

4. Tom aad Jerry's Rockeu 
- Weird sounds, ohhhhhhh 
WOWWWWW, myyyy Gooodddd. 

5. Children of Sanchez -
Chuck Mangione - For a quick 
case of diabetes. 

6. Frieadll - Chick Corea-
Corea, who everyone knows is 
capable of much beller, is 
rapidly turning into the most 
prolific and easily dispeDlible 
hack musician since Elton 
John. That's progress?

'Ice Castles' Crumbles 
By Lyneue Tom 

Staff Wri&er 
Columbia's Ice Caslles fits 

perfectiy into the "Jill Kinmont 
mold" of motion pictures, in 
which its heroine, an aspiring, 
young athlete, is severely 
handicapped in tragedy, only to 
rise again in triumph through 
the love of one special man. 
While the film has the expected 
moments of sob and sap, 
viewers can rest assured that 
their tearducts and sugar levels 
will remain normal. 

Gary L. Baim and Donald 
Wrye's screenplay of a nearly 
sightless ice skater Alexis 
Winston (Lynn-Holly Johnson) 
and her ice hockey steady Nick 
Peterson (Robby Benson) is 

simple in portrayal and easy to 
follow ... almost. The storyline's 
pace is hindered by technical 
Claws, The Cluid panoramas of 
the Iowan countryside and 
imaginative perspective shots 
of Lexie's surroundings seen 
through her eyes are marred by 
wavering camera movements 
and poor framing . In addition, 
the audience comes close to 
becoming blind itself in one 
edited sequence jump from a 
wrestling confrontation in a 
shadow-shrouded attic to a 
skating endeavor on a sun-
reflective pond. 

Robby Benson seems to fa vor 
playing either a rebellious son 
or a lovesick ,adolescent. In Ice 
Castles, he attempts a new 

venture: comedy. One scene in 
particular where Benson 
appears with his body bared 
except for briefs, evokes mote 
giggles of disbelief than coos of 
delight. Although he receives 
star billing in the movie's 
credits, Benson takes a back 
seat to Lynn-Holly Johnson. 
Her fresh, perky looks rival 
that of Benson 's former 
partner , Glynnis O'Connor 
(Ode to Billy Joe) , if not her 
acting, which consists of stereo-
typical reactions and small talk 
dialogue. However, she makes 
up for it with her skating 
routines. Choreographed by 
Brian Foley, Johnson performs 
them with all the dazzle and 
grace which captivated 

,'I Had Never Skated' 
Robbie Benson Keeps Gliding Anyway 

By Stan Hoada 
If It weren't for the wait-

resses who kept asking for his 
autograph, our companion at 
lunch could have been an 
average college student. As 
customers at nearby tables 
glanced our way, be talked 
about his sports idols as a 
youth, about movies ("I see 
just about every movie"), 
about basketball in high school 
and his girlfriend. He also 
spoke on movie scripts written 
jointly with hiI father (Olle 011 
One for example), experi-
ences while filmina his current 
movie and on writing music, 
which mak_ Robbie Benson a 
little bit different than an 
avera.e 22-year-old. 

Benson was In San Diego 
recently to promote the new 
Columbia film, Ice CuLles, in 
\\ hich he stars as a hockey 
player that helps a world class 
ice skater, who has just I08t her 

eyesight, regain her con-' 
fidence. The skater is played by 
Lynn-Holly Johnson who, in 
fact, was a world class skater 
until a broken leg stalled her 
career. Among Johnson's close 
friends while ,rowing up in 
Connecticut, says the Columbia 
blo, was Dorothy Hamill, of 
Olympic fame. 

"I had never skated on ice 
before the movie," said Robbie, 
recalling the shooting of Ice 
CasUes. He went through 2 
months of training to perfect 
his abilities with, ..... the best

amona them, Barbara Wil-
liams, who teaches power 
skating to the New York 
Islanders. 

The best part of the hockey 
scenes, for Robbie, was when 
they were completed. " Boy, did 
I celebrate when that was over. 
I threw my skates away and I 
never want to ,0 near ice 

again." What kept him on the 
blades was " pseudo-con-
fidence", but that didn ' t keep 
the athletic actor from

Colleen Dewhurst shines as 
Beulah Smith, Lexie's feisty , 
vituperative coach and 
confidant. Sut Tom Skerritt 
hardly flickers as Marcus 
Winston, Lexie's father. 

"Not trying is wondering all 
your life if you gave up too 
soon," says Nick Peterson of 
Alexis Winston. He could be 
referring to the film as well. 
Despite its shortcomings , Ice

them to stand once more in the

The Other Gallery offers a unique display of arlo 

'The Other Gallery' is 
Another Thing Altogether 

By Lynette Tom 
Slaff Writer 

Its door is labeled with a 
simple 1200. However, the room 
tucked below UCSD's Hu-
manities Library is known by 
another name, The Other 
Gallery, which is operated for 
and by the students. 

The gallery was originally 
under the direction of the 
Visual Arts Department. In 
1976, students established the 
Undergraduate Art Guild . 
Later, renamed the Other 
Gallery Committee, the student 
organization would deal in the 
running and maintenance of the 
gallery, while the department 

. would provide the attendance 
and space. 

An individual student or a 
group of students may sign up 
to exhibit their work for one 
week period$. They are solely 
responsible for the publicity. 
display, and dismantling. For 
those unacquainted in these 
aspects, T~e Other Gallery 

Committee sponsored an 
undergraduate seminar which 
met on Thursday evenings. Not 
only were the students intro-
duced to the mechanics behind 
an art show, but they were also 
given "a sense of community 
with the other undergraduate 
students," as expressed by 
Other Gallery student manager 
Jeanine Mellinger . Next 
quarter, a directed group study 
will be offered under the 
instruction of Jehanne Teilhet 
- a prospect which Mellinger 
finds " pretty exciting." 

" It' s a real learning ex-
perience to do it yourself," she 
continued. " You get responses 
from people that you wouldn't 
normally get. " 

Mellinger's role as student 
manager is unique, as she will 
be managing during the entire 
academic year, instead of the 
customary single quarter. 

"I enjoy this kind of work, II 
said the undergraduate Visual 
Arts major, who has previously 

worked at both the Mandeville 
Art and Other Galleries. 

Because of its isolated 
location, The Other Gallery has 
a ring of obscurity among 
UCSD students. Efforts are 
being made by The Other 
Gallery Committee, student 
exhibitioners and Mellinger to 
generate more publicity. In 
addition, the relocation of 
OASIS to the lower C100r of the 
Humanities Library has 
helped, according to the stu-
dent manager, in "getting 
people to know that it's (Other 
Gallery) here ." However, 
despite the lack of notability, 
the gallery has succeeded in 
exhibiting the work of 15 
students every week, as well as 
drawing in an average of ISO 
viewers a week. 

The shows range in all forms 
of art. The upcoming shows 
include drawing , painting, 
sculpture, film. video, pho-
tography, and various mixed

Jenkel Uses Funds SD State 

Withdraws 
Holdings'~ 

Saltman Is Finalist 
(Con&lDued from pale 1) 

Jenkel met with the students 
Dec. 27, giving Saltman a 
"mixed recommendation," 
then returned to Lake ')\ahoe 
via the Reno airport the same 
day he left. 

On the trip Jenkel said he 
gained inaights Into the way the 
Texas students are governed 
and bopes to ,ain future favon 
from the Texas students 
regarding , applicants from 
Texas before UCSD search 
committees, a comment on 
which be refused to elaborate. 

The Texas AS was dissolved 
last March in a student 
referendum, but Jenkel says he 
learned something about the 
way Texas budgets are 
handled, and how much money 
students there control. 

About the expenses of the 
trip, Jenkel says that "I could 

have gotten them to (pay for 
it) ," but repeated the 
possibility of Texas providing 
similar favon for him in the 
future. 

Jenkel also says that the 
Texas representatives offered 
to come to Lake Tahoe to meet 
with him, but Jenkel nixed that 
suggestion both because his 
cabin there isa "family place, II 
and because he wanted to meet 
the UT students in the company 
of AS Vice President Carberry 
and President's Council 
member Kevin Eckery, though 
Eckery was later unable to 
attend the meeting. 

While there will be "00 direct 
benefit" to UCSD students from 
the trip, Jenkel says , 
" exchange on a student level is 
always worthwhile, and helps 
the government. II 

(Continued from page J) 
Jose State and Cal State Los 
Angeles have taken similar 
action. No UC campus bas 
divested aa of yet. 

The state Senate Select 
Committee on Investment haa 
listed 10 banks that do business 
in South Africa . These banks 
are: Bank of America, Wells 
Fargo, United Bank of Cali-
fornia, Chartered Bank of 
California, Chartered Bank of 
London, French Bank of Cali-
fornia, Union Bank, Sumitomo, 
Security Pacific and Crocker 
National Bank. 

(Continued from page 1) 
Tuma added, and they are 
being more careful this time in 
their choice. 

The UT Regents met for two 
and a half hours Saturday 
before deciding to postpone the 
appointment, many of them 
expressing a desire to get to 
know the candidates better. 
Consequently, Saltman may 
have to return to Texas in the 
next month for further 
meetings with UT Regents. 

Saltman did not apply for the 
presidency of Texas-Austin, a 
position equivalent to a 
chancellor in the UC system, 
but was nominated by a search 
committee-affiliated agency. 

That method is a common one 
for colleges and universities 
around the nation when 
important positions are open. 
UCSD is. using that system now, 
looking for a Muir College dean 
and a Student Center Director.

These banks offer a higher 
rate of interest on time cer-
tificate accounts, according to 
DeKoven. " We were getting 
14.75 percent interest at Bank of 
America." 

The decision was made by the 
student council to put all cash 
reserves in savings and loans 
associations, which are pro-
hibited from making foreign 
investments , explained 

DeKo~en . "In October, we 
physically did it, " he said.

Graduate students are also 
welcome to display their work. 
The Gallery has been the site of 
several FMA exhibitions. Nor 
is the Gallery restricted to the 
Visual Arts students. Last year, 
writing courses were invited to 
review the shows. As a result, 
many students were, as Mel-
linger put it, "exposed to 
something different. II So, too, 
will the UCSD student who 
enters the Other Gallery during 
it's hours of 12 to 5 pm, Monday

Af a-Jewish Relations Strained 
(CoDlillue rom Pare Z) 
beirt IUra earUertbia year. 
KiDI Kb i told Ambusador 
Andrew 0 I and Cleveland 
representatave Louis Stokes 
that the rumors "burt very 
mucb. " But the kiD" s own 
comments , Uke tbose of most 
Arab officials, showed little 
familiarity witb tbe sen-
sitivities of black Americans. 

"He said tbat in bis own 
family, he had been raised by a 
black woman," Stokes told the 
Bilalian News followilll his 
meetin, with tbe kinl, ., and 
that all of his children had been 
raised by a black woman and 
that it would never occur to his 
family to discriminate. " 

The Saudi leader apparently 
was unaware how often 
American blacks hear similar 
statements from southern 
whites about their black 
"mammies." Similarly Arabs 
find it hard to believe that Afro-
Americans worry about the 
Arab role in the slave trade, or 
take seriously charges by some 
American blacks, including 
Eldridge Cleaver, that they 
have suffered racial dis-
crimination in Arab countries. 

Even the richest Arab oil 
countries also have neglected 
investment and philanthropic 
opportunities that might 
benefit both black Americans 

and themselves. While Arab 
lovernments have endowed 
Arab Studies departments at 
two prestigious U.S. uni-
versities, and also made major 
donations to the Cleveland 
hospital where King KhaUd 
underwent surgery, none of the 
more than 50 U.S. colleges, nor 
the dozen or more hospitals, 
founded by American blacks 
have been beneficiaries of Arab 
support. 

Meanwhile supporters of 
Israel continue intensive 
efforts to maintain the support 
of Afro-Americans, including 
black Moslems, in spite of 
tensions between the black and 
Jewish communities. At 
present, no Arab group makes 
any special effort to reach the 
black media. But the American 
Jewish Congress funds and 
staffs a special office, the Black 
Media Task Force, which 
systematically presents the 
Israeli position to hundreds of 
black publications and 
journalists each week. While no 
Arab leader has ever spoken 
out in specific terms on civil 
rights issues like the 
Wilmington Ten , Jewish 
Americans continue to provide 
major, if diminished, support 
for black causes. N 0 Ara~ 
supported organization seeks to 
mobilize black American 

public opinion on tbe Mideast 
conflict. But Union leader 
Bayard Rustin's Black 
American Support Israel 
Committee (BASIC) is so 
active that its membership 
includes most prominent black 
civic, professional and 
lovernment officials, a. well as 
black sports and entertainment 
filUres from all over the 
country. 

There are also other factors. 
"Zioni.m is imperiali&m," 
declares Amiri Baraka, the 
fiery poet, a black nationalist 
turned Marxist, in a recent New 
York interview. But even he 
concedes that it is "sobering for 
blacks when they come up 
against the class distinctions 
that exist, despite Islam, in the 
Arab world. II "The middle 
class black ," adds an 
educational consultant in 
Washington, "tends to fear 
Arabs because of the fear of 
being tom between the Arab 
position and the Jewish 
position." 

One of the reasons for the fear 
is that the Israel Lobby does not 
hesitate to use the stick as well 
as the carrot. Four years ago, 
pro-Israel groups raised a 
$50,000 war chest and sought 
out pro-Israeli black can-
didates to oppose Berkeley 
Congressman Ronald V.

13. Q: Are We Not Men A: We 
Are Devo - A lot of people 
chuckle at the purposeful 
innanity that Devo dishes out, 
but personally I prefer Little 
Richard. At least Richard had 
the integrity to realize that his 
music was innane and nothing 
else. Devo is too busy laughing

Dellum. wben he voted apin.t 
an Israeli-supported arms 
proposal. DeHums successfully 
overcame tbe challen,e, but 
Dr. Archie Har,rave, former 
president of Shaw University in 
Durbam~ N.C., was not 10 
fortunate. In early 1977, the 
black educator visited several 
Arab countries on a ,ood will 
mission sponsored by the Arab 
Lea,ue. Har,rave also 
attracted Arab and Iranian 
students to his financially-
pressed institution and hired a 
handful of American in-
structors of Arab descent. 

Following his return from the 
Mideast, Hargrave was beset 
with massive opposition from 
the trustees of the church-
controlled school, and forced 
from office. Wbile Shaw 
University under Har,rave had 
many serious problems, hiB 
supporters say it was bis 
experiment in building 
intellectual - and financial -
bridges to the Arabs that sealed 
his doom. 

The absence of effective 
black-Arab relations on any 
level contrasts sharply with the 
growing influence Afro-

Americans have on U.S. policy 
south of the Sahara, and tbe 
support African officials now 
give U.S. blacks in retum. 

Tbe Con,ressional Black 
Caucus frequently meet. with 
bigb administration officials to 
propose policy toward 
Rhodesia, Namibia and South 
Africa, and Andrew Young has 
emerged 81 the single moat 
important policy maker in that 
area. 

When a black youth was 
attacked and killed by Hassidic 
Jews in Brooklyn last year, the 
Arabs remained silent. But 
Dramane Outtara, executive 
secretary of the Or,anization of 
African Unity, overcame what 
he caUed bis "reluctance as a 
diplomat" to comment on 
internal . U.S. affairs. "If tbe 
Jews c~n Jive 80 much support 
to Israel, wby then shGuld the 
Africans remain silent when 
thei'r kith and kin are being 
murdered?" Outtara asked 
during a visit to the United 
Nations. "When this killing 
took place in Brooklyn, I felt 

. that enough was enough. I 
thought the least we could do 
was to express our solidarity. II
