" Last year when I lived in Texas, the brother of a gi 

called me camel-jockey," Reza, an undergraduate I 
student, said. 

Californians are not so blatantly prejudiced, according to Reza, 
but Iranian students have an image problem wherever they go

Many said they believe the , media . are in tu~ con~.r0lled 
political figures opposed to the revolutIonary Iramans. Why 
is it that we sent a hundred letters to the editor of the San 
Union telling them how bad the Shah is and they never printed 

them? " one asked. 
They also named a specific network and accused them 

presenting one-sided news making it look like the Shah had

When the Berma n Bill , which 
insures public employee the 
right to bargain collectively, 
comes into effect in July, 
unionized UC employees expect 
to practice this right.

The release assert elrorts 
have been made at UCSD to 
block union representation by 
threatening employ es with th

Stronski cited th " harassment

'Inn r Pulse' Explains Ups, 
,Do,wns of Cosmic Rhyt~m 
Wonder Why Nothing, or Everything, Went Right? 
Music is Metaphor for Answer to Such Phenomena 

By Rasa GUstailis 
Pacific News Service 

You know those days when everything goes 
wrong - from the moment you burn the toast 
in the morning till you tripoverthedoormaton 
your way home at dusk - and then those other 
days when you seem to move in perfect rhythm 
with the universe and all kinds of unexpected 
delights come your way . 

Well, consider this by way of explanantion. 
Within each of us "there exists a silent pulse of 
perfect rhythm, a complex of wave forms and 
resonances, which is absolutely individual and 
unique, and yet which connects us to 
everything in the universe. The act of getting in 
touch with this pulse can transform our 
personal experience and in some way alter the 
world around us. " 

So writes George Leonard, black belt aikido 
master and president elect of the Association 
for Humanistic Psychology. 

At moments when we a re awa re of tha t 
rhythm, he a rgues, we move gracefully and 
are capable of our highest experiences. When 
we lose that awareness. things jam. 
(Rasa Gustaitis is an associate editor of 
Pacific News Service.) 

This perception, elaborated in Leonard 's 
newlv published book " The Silent Pulse, " is il1 
' keeping with the discoveries of quantum 
physicists that we live in a world of processes 
a nd relationships, rather than of discrete 
entities. The process of observation, it is now 
known . changes botb the observer and the 
thing observed . We a re inextricably part of 
everything w tou h. 

Leonard ' concept o[ the inner pulse also 
corresponds with a discovery by Soviet 
chemist B.P . Belousov in 1959. that some 
molecules, when dipped into water, will 
pulsate in regular patterns as they react to the 
immersion. With the right kind 0[. dye, th ey 
become visible under a microscope as 
kaleidoscopic pictures that remind one of 
clouds in Tibetan paintings, a nd of the forms 
Western artists drew after psychedelic 
experiences. 

Many scientists, world-wide, have become 
intrigued by these " chemical clocks" and are 
seeking to understand them in pursuit of clue,; 
to the underlying rules of nature. 

Leonard s uggests that a ll we know ca n be 
viewed in terms of rhythmic fields , with music 
and da nce as the most appropria te metaphors. 
Each person, he says, pulsates in his own 
unique patterns, but a lso in re lation to others. 
Common rhythmic patterns connect people 

within various ethnic and language groups. 
Rhythmic di((erences block understanding. 

In the 1960s, when he conducted interracial 
encounter groups with Dr. Price Cobbs, a 
black psychiatrist, Leonard found that a 
certain process recurred. Each time, when the 
group despaired of ever coming to an 
understanding , some barrier suddenly 
crumbled and communication began. 

Listening to tapes of one of these sessions, 
Leonard noticed that the turning point was 
linked to a rhythmic breakthrough. At one 
moment, everyone was yelling abuse. Then 
there waS silence. Then the abuse resumed, 
but more softly and - in perfect rhythm. This 
ended in relieved laughter and then, finally , 
allowed real talk to begin. 

Leonard connected this observation with one 
made back in 1665 by a Dutch scientist, 
Chri tian Huygens, who found that when he 
.mounted two pendulUln clocks side by sideon a 
wall they would tick in perfect unison. 

Later, others found that whenever two 
oscillators in the same field pulsate nearly 
simu lta neously. they will " lock in" to pulsate 
at exactly the amc time. This phenomenon 
oomc to be called entrainment. It reflect · 
nClture's efficiency: it takes less energy to 
pulsate in cooper<ltion than in opposition . 

The interracial enco unter group had 
experienced entminment which, to Leonard , is 
" the b<l is of a ll verbal interaction" and a lso 
"our most accessible entry into the dance of 
the universe .. , 

Entnlinment occurs when two people are 
engaged in conversation and, without even 
bing aware of it , make tiny rhythmic 
movement in response to each other. It 
happens between a ny charismatic leader and ' 
his followers . It accounts for the elation 
Hitler's followers felt when they shouted, 
thousa nds together. "Sieg Heil!" It is very 
evident whenever musicians improvise 
together. Astronomers are familiar with the 
phenomenon, watching galaxies moving in 
relation to each other. 

Leonard suggests that " we are aCCected 
many ways, known a nd unknown, by 'the 
pulsing fields that crisscross all the space in 
which we live" a nd that we also affect them. 

He 'quotes the eminent physicist John 
Wheeler: " I think that through our own act of 
conSCiously choosing and posing questions 
about the universe. we bring about , in some 
measure. what we see taking place before us. "

The Guardian's article o( 
Monday, March 12, ' entitled 
" In(iltrating Council, ,. 
regarding the development of 
interns in(iJtratinl the S.D. City 
Council, has prompted me to 
clarify an incorrect assumption 
as well as inform the UCSD 
communitl' about the Warren 
Collejfe Academic Internship 
Program. 

The article, stating that "the 
Warren College internship 
program, which deals mostly in 
communications and com· 
munity work experience ... .. is a 
misrepresentation o( the 
breadth of the program . 
Students work in of(-eampus 
organizations and agencies 
under the supervision o( a full-
time University staff member. 
Tasks vary depending on the 
placement, but each student 
has the opportunity of getting 
an introdu~tion to the work of 
the organization and also 
undertaking a specific project. 
Students ha ve worked in 
government office. medi cal 
research laboratories . busine ' 
age nci es , socia l s rvice 
organizations and addi tional 
pl aceme nts in other fields . 
Students have ha d internships 
in th e San Diego area , 
throughout California and the 
na tion. 

Academic internships are 
expected to co ntribute 
meaningfully to a s tudent's 
aca demi c program and 
complement his/her classroom 
work. An internship must 
support a s tudent's program of 
study at UCSD: therefore, not 
all possible internships are 
accepted (or academic credit. 
Each student is supervised by a 
faculty member Clnd is 
responsible (or completing a 
journal documenting the 
experience as well as a major 
research paper on the project. 

Warren College is dedicated 
to the philosophy that an 
internship experience provides 
students with the opportunity to 
fake their education beyond the 

classroom and to view the 
world beyond the University. 
The internship program, which 
Warren College has developed, 
is a model o( education which 
responds to a rapidly changing 
world and the desire among 
students and educators to 
study and engage in that world.

Editor: 

" In the February 9th issue of 
The Guardian there was an 
article on Religion and 
Sexuality. Through the 
courtesy of a concerned friend I 
only caught up with the article 
last week. I do not question the 
a ttributions or quotes or by 
inference the integrity of the 
reporter or the newspaper. 
With speCific reference to the 
" no rule in pre-marital 
sexuality" quote I found that to 
be very clumsy and mis-
leading. The clumsy and mis-
l ea ding n a ture of th<lt 
s tatement is my responsibility. 

" Both in my personal and the 
ecclesial views of my religious 
community the norm for the 
full expression of sexual 
intimacy is in terms of 
marriClge. Full sexual intim<lcy 

. without marriClge - without 
the public commitment ot 
marriage - without the public 
commitment to love each other 
- falls short.of that consistent 
norm. The reason (or this 
consistenl norm is thut we 
perceive the meaning of sexual 
intercourse not so much ClS a 
making of love but as a 
celebr<ltlon of a love that a 
couple. have personally and 
publicly committed themselves 
to."

Egypt, Israel Near Final 
Mideast Peace Treaty 

CAIRO. Egypt (AP) - President Carter concluded his Mideast 
odyssey yesterday with Egypt embracing peace terms and Israeli 
Prime Minister Menachem Begin vowing to resign unless his 
parliament accepts them. Both nations said a treaty could be 
signed within the month. 

Begin agreed to the U.S. compromise proposals and said he 
would work to persuade his cabinet and parliament to approve 
them. The prime minister called a special meeting of the cabinet 
for today amid signs that approval was likely. 

After a final shuttle from Jerusalem to Cairo, Carter flew home. 
The mood aboard Air Force One was upbeat. 

Begin said the three leaders would sign the accord in 
WasnlOgton. Then Begin and Sadat would sign the Hebrew version 
in Jerusalem and the Arabic text in Cairo. 

The breakthrough came in the last hours of the peace gamble 
Carter began when he left home last Wednesday . 

" I am convinced that now we have defined a ll of the main 
ingl-edients of a peace trea ty between Egypt and Is rael which will 
be the corner stone of a comprehensive peace settlement for the 
Middle East," the president said before leaving Ca iro.

Athletes of· the 'Mo'nth 
Sharpe of Baseball Team and Keene of Cagers 
Mark Sharpe of the men's 

intercollegiate baseball team 
and J ill Keene of the women's 
basketball team have been 
selecte d as Fe!:>ruary's 
Athletes of the Month. The pair 
was chosen from a field of eight 
entries represe nti ng six 
intercollegiate teams that 
competed during February. 

BASE BALL 
According to baseball coach 

Vince Askey . Sh(lrpe is (I 
" coach's dr~am ... I have the 
utmost respect and admiration 
for Mark," Askey continued. 
" With possible exception of

Cycle 
Co~test 

By John Klock 
Starr Wr iler 

If you plan on driving to 
UCSD Saturday , avoid the 
roads around Warren College. 
Unless you are bringing (I 
bicycle. th(lt is, and plan on 
competing in one of the races 
which wi ll keep the roads 
blocked to traffic from 7: 30 am . 
until almost 5 pm . 

A l.2 mile circuit of Gilman 
Drive, Miramar Road , and 
Myers Drive should attract 
racers from around Southern 
C(l l iforn ia (lnd even other 
western states, a<!cordlng to 
De(ln Patterson. coach of the 
UCSD Bicycling Team . 

"This is the first major race 
we ' ve ever spo nsDred, " 
Patterson said. 

The men's and women 's 
races , five and four laps at 
ll: 30 a nd 11 : 50 respectively, 
for UCSD studentll, staff and 
faculty. " don't have to be high-
ly competitive," according to 
Patterson. But they carry $30 
and $25 first prize aW<lrds , and 
recognize the first five 
finishers . 

For the intercollegiate 
racers, by contrast, this will be 
the first r(lce of the season, and 
thus very competitive. " At the 
beginning there are always new 
riders trying to move up." 

The lure of ,1200 to $150(, in 
pl'izcs will attrilct amateurs in 
eight categories . 

In all, 250 cyc li I are 
expected. with a large 
percentage coming from the 
Los Angeles urea, Palter on 
S<l id . 

(Please ,urn to pale 11) 

most outstanding baseball 
player to ever attend UCSD." 

Sharpe. a Thi rd College 
junior, compiled a .320 batting 
average for 12 games during 
Fe b r uary . The second 
baseman stole 21 bases in as 
many attempts. 

Askey is most impressed by 
Sharpe's desire for im · 
provement, singling out the 
athlete as a definite pro 
prospect. Des pite his individual 
talents Sharpe is definitely a 
team player, " always putti ng 
the team above himself. " 

Besides two and one half 
hours of practice every day, 
Sharpe puts in time on liis own 
in order to reach the team's 
goal of a winning season. 

BASKETBALL 
The 1978-79 women ' s 

basketball season was seen as a 
growing year by Coach Judy 
Malone . The young squad 
compiled an overa ll record of 
3-18, not a very impressive 
record in itself. However, the 
ski ll improvements and 
leadership abilities demon-
strated by freshman Jill Keene 
over the course of the season 
brought her Athlete of the 
Month honors. 

As a freshman , Keene was 
team captain, leading the team 
in scori ng with 13.1 points per 
game. Malone called Keene the 
Triton ' s " most effective 
offensive player," with a 
season high of 24 points . 

On the defensive end of the 

game Keene called out' tht> 
team's defensive alignments 
while averaging 5.7 rebounds a 
game, second highest on the 
team. 

"Jill has taken the respon-
sibility to run the team on the 
court," commented Malone. 
" Although our team didn 't win 
a lot of games Jill has never 
given up." 

Malone and Keene are both 
exited for next year 's season. 
The team is hoping to add 
several new players to next 
year 's roster, including two 
women over six feet. " We 
should be good next year," 
Keene said. 

" We're a really close team," 
Keene rema rked. " We' ll be 
p laying at lunchtime every day 
for the rest of the year ." 

Right no\:\, the Muir freshma n 
is playing on the intercollegiate 
women 's softball team as a 
pitcher and shortstop, wa iting 
in anticipation for basketba ll 
season to roll a round once 
again.

Sailors Drop From 
First to Third 

By John Klock 
Slaff WrIter 

The UCSD sailing team 
dropped from a tie fo r fi rst 
place to a tie for third last 
weekend in the Southern Series' 
competition which decides who 
goes on to state level. 

In the Southern Series Three 
and Four at Mission Bay 
Saturday and Sunday the te<lm 
placed eighth and fifth out of 16 
to drop behind UCLA <lnd UC 
Irvine, into a tie with Long 
Beach State . 

This compares with a first 
and second , in the previous 
series. What happened ? 

" That's a good question," 
Mark Folkman, team member 
and coach, said. " It was 
windier this weekend , <lnd we 
had light crews. Some people 
aid we needed heavier people 

for the higher winds." 

" We also didn 't have all our 
people . here, because finals 
are coming up," he added. 

The sailors will have a 
chance to recoup some of their 
loss April 1 at Alamitos Bay in 
Long Beach in the last series . It 
was supposed to have been held 
the weekend of Feb. 24, but was 
postponed. 

The team can arford to drop 
as far as seventh place, and still 
qualify for the California 
Elims, which in turn qualify 
teams to the regional and 
national levels. 

La t weekend Folkma n 
skippered the A boat with Sue 
Johnson a his crew, and in the 
B boat Dave Strong kippered 
on Saturday and Trevor Bayliss 
on Sunday , with Karen Butler 
crewln" both days. (A and B 
are divi Ions for convenience, 
and do not indicate kill level .)

BllJDWEISER . PRESENTS: 
INTRAMURAL 

PLAY-OFF PREVIEW 
Tenth week, winter quarter ... 

sometimes referred to as the week 
before finals. It's pressure time ... time 
to get down to business for students. 
Over in the intramural office, it's 
pressure time also ... but pressure of a 
different sort. It 's 1M Play-orr 
Madness Week ... time to throw out the 
balls and let league champions and 
runners-up go at it in their quest for 
good 0)' No. One. The All-Campus 
Basketball Championships, Kahuna 
Cup Soccer, the Hula Bowl. Floor 
Hockey Championships ... it·s all 
happening this week in the 
culmination or another busy and 
action filled intramural quarter. 

Following is a final re-cap of the 
winter 1M action with a special play-
olf preview of all sports by your 
friendly campus soothsayer, the 
infamous, redcaped squirt you've 
come to know and love, the BUDMAN. 

BASKETBALL 
Men's AAA (Final Four) : Capital 

Insulation (8-0) vs New York Dicks (7-
2) , Run But No Gu n (5-2) vs ScruCf 
Broidos (3-4) 

The BUDMAN report: Capital 
Insulation is playing their best ball of 
the year at just the right time. The 
Caps have it all- superior rebounding 
(Tom Polk and Bob Peterson) ,outside 
shooting (Aubrey Fenderson, Hal 
Jacobs and Fairbanks Jones) and the 
best player in tournament (Tom 
Polk) . The NY Dicks can shoot a little, 
but they're so old they can't get out.of 
their own way sometimes. 

Most serious threat toCapital should 
be Run But No Gun who sport a 
heavyweight frontline and out-
standing playmaker and scorer in 
Kenny Stark. Scruff Broidos, the 
surprise team of 1M basketball won a 
71-70 upset shocker last Sunday 
evening over heavily favored Better 
Bounds. The Budman sez: The CAPS 
to breeze in Three-A. 

Men ' s AA (Final Eight) : 
Hooterville Express (8-0) vs Wildcats 
(8-1) , Med Studs (8-0) vs Carotid 
BQdies (6-3). Mirage (7-2) vs Whiff (8-

1) , Too Short to Dunk (7-2) vs Divinity 
City (8-1). 

The BUD MAN report: The action 
has been fast and furious in the first 
two rounds of AA play which is fast 
becoming the most competitive of all 
divisions. Top-seeded HooterviIle 
Express roared out of the station 
Monday night with a hard-fought 54-44 
win over Go ForGIory as Phil D 'Acri's 
16 points led a balanced Hooterville 
attack. The train lovers seem to have 
a ll the components ror a successful run 
at the championship. Andy Berg plays 
engineer, Mike Lenihan and Larry 
Vanden Bos provide horsepower on 
the boards , Richard Schmidt and 
D' Acri get the points, and Brian Finley 
conducts everything from the rear 
with a steady floor game and extra 
sco ring when needed. The survivor or 
the bottom bracket will be more than a 
formidable opponent in the finals. 
Mirage, Whiff and Divinity City all 
have the chemistry to ma ke it, but Too 
Short to Dunk knows how "to win the 
close ones. T5TD played like the 
Cardiac Kids in 50-49 and 41).39 play-of[ 
wins over the Tenacious Testicles and 
the Cunning Linguists. The Budma n 
predicts: Defending champion Whiff 
to derail Hooterville Express. 

Men's A (Final Ten) : Gravity (8-0) 
vs Hard on the Court (H), THC (5-3) 
vs Basket Cas~s-Lust for Glory 
winner. Hacks (8-0) vs Sunshine 
Brewers (7-1) , Schmata (7-1) vs 
Frumpkins or Hoopless. 

The BUDMAN report: It looks like 
clear sailing to the finals for the only 
two undefeated teams left in Single-A, 
Gravity and Hac ks. Both teams 
average around a 2O-point blowout per 
outing and neither shows signs or 
letting up in the play-oCfs. Gravity 
destroyed Jumping Java Men 71-39, 
while the Hacks carved upSmellsLike 
A Fish 48-27. Best bet to sneak through 
as a darkhorse is Hard On The Court 
who used 54 points by Tom Eichenberg 
to arrest the MP's 65-50. The Budman 
s lects: Gravity to bring all Single-A 
dreamers back to earth.

The BUDMAN report : Another 
wide-open division with four strong 
threats for the title. Key game of first-
round action pltl hyperactive For 
Real against Chick Hearn's favorite 
1M team Popcorn in what promises to 
be a real kettle-popper. Gil Ruiz, Jere 
Wolfe and Bruce Brysocker have been 
shooting ·an!i talking themselves into 
the Number One spot all season long, 
but all of that aside they've still been 
burning the nets with their run and gun 
style of play . Nobody is more anxious 
to play them than Jimmie Brown's TC 
Players who ran up a number of 
impressive scores in the Stormin' 
Norman League this winter. At the 
other end of the draw is perennial 
nickel-dime powerhouse lntercourts 
who have been struggling as of late 
with an assortment of injuries and 
what-have-you. Mark Sharpe andlvan 
Ho hold the key to recapturing some of 
that lost glory from past campaigns in 
the 5-10 wars. 

The Budman predicts: For Real to 
outrun, outshoot, and outtalk every 
team out of the gym and prove once 
a nd for all that they are FOR REAL! 

Coed (Final Nine) : Original Basket 
Cases (8-0) vs Barry's Bombers (7-1), 
Hot Sturf (6-0) vs Easy Layins-Stud's 
Stumps winners, Tired of Being on Top 
(8-0) vs Second String (6-1), Basket 
Cases (6-2) vs GYST (7-0). 

The BUDMAN report: The Original 
BC's and Tiredor Heingon Top seem to 
have a corner on all of the all-star 
talent in this division and neither are 
bashful about showing it orr. OBC is 
averaging their victory margins at the 
rate of 43.4 with strong inside 
performances rrom Marla Ross , 
Ginny Richards , and Linda Covich. 
TOBOT fe atures Sheila O·Brien, Eva 
Ljungwe, and Connie Parker in. an 
attack tha t averages close to 60 points 
per game. Chief threat to unseat these 
two are GVST and 13arry's Bombers 
who finished 1-2 in the Double Dribble 
League. 

The Budman picks: Tired of Being 
on Top to climb to newer heights and 
find ultimate satisfaction (Sigh!) 

Women ·s (Fi n a l Two) : Th e 
Women·s Championship Game: GO 
FOR IT AGAIN (3-3) vs. KNOCKERS 
(4-2) . _ 

The BUDMAN report: A surprise 
final Cor two teams who at the 
beginning of the year all played on the 
same clun, Splitting th two teams 
up didn ' t seem to dilute their 
effectiveness as both are ploying at 
the top of their gume. Knockers use a 
sti ngy 3-2 zone defen e that seems tu 
bother most team ' thut they play , but 
the~" ll havc their hands full with 
Murla Hoss and Ginny Richurds. 

The Budmun likes: The Knockers to 
bounce pasl Go Fur It Again in a 
defensive struggle. 

KAHUNA CUP SOCCER 
Men 's AAA Cham pionshi p: Sockers 

(7-0) vs Klub Feat (5-0-1) or Strikers 
Express (3-0) . 

Season long AAA leader Sockers are 
looking for competition and should get 
it from cithcr Klub Feat or Strikers 
Express. Maihub Abdussalam run 
the field well for the Sockers and has 
kicked home 6 goal this eason to 
boot, Rodolfo Ibarra ha c hipped in 
with 4 goals and Salvador Diaz ha 
added anothcr three to highlight the 
Sockcr attuck . Strikers Express back 
in the play-uffs after the Losers were 
found to hav u d Ineligible pillyers 

feature a quick-striking attack built 
around Seme Simelane and Chie 
Nwosu. Klub Feat rely heavily on 
Greg Lyons to do most oftheir scoring, 
but stili boast the best defensive game 
in the division_ 

The BUDMAN 's Kick·1t Line: 
Sockers to outscore Klub Feat by a 
goal in a high scoring affair. 

Men's 'AA Championship: Open 
Minds (7-1).1) vs Paragon (6-1). 

Another classic match·up in the 
offing pitting irresistable force vs 
immovable object. Open Minds score 
from anywhere on the field attested to 
by their 23 goals scored this season. 
Ken Clifton has nine of 'em to pace a 
bot club that dusted previously 
unbeaten Rocky Mtn. Oysters and 
Cosmic Muffins over the weekend. 
Paragon gets offense from Merv 
Thompson but still haven't allowed a 
goal in three play-off games. 

The BUD MAN wants: Open Minds 
to score at least three times in a wild 
one. 

Coed AAA Championship : 
Quicksilver (4-1-1) vs Headless 
Thompson Gunners (7-0) . 

Quicksilver is looking for the 
proverbial hat-trick in '79. In 1977 they 
won the Single-A Coed championship, 
last year they copped the AA crown 
and this weekend they't:e looking to 
make it three straight. Lap Sam Tam 
and Julie Byers lead the scorers for 
Quicksilver but defense is also one of 
their strong suits. The HT Gunners 
have not been tested yet, but aren't 
about to overlook one now. Glenn Calta 
and Carol Petrie get most of the goals, 
but soccer neophytes Bob Peterson 
and Rick Vetti can run and score.also. 

The BUD MAN doesn 't want any 
part of this one: A toss-up. 

Coed AA Championship: Loco-
MotHes (7-1) vs. Bifurcation (5-1-1) . 

Both these teams can score but, 
Loco-Motiles might be missing the 
services of their top all-around player 
Walter Roewekamp. Carol Post and 
Manuel Ares may have to pick up the 
slack io his absence but nevertheless, 
the Loco-Motiles still have put 30 balls 
into the net this season. Bifurcation is 
coming on strong with Maihub 
Abdussalam leading the way with a 
league leading 10 goals , but their 
strong defense may be pressed into 
double duty this Sunday. 

The BUD MAN predicts: Bifurcation 
in a low scoring contest. 

HAWAUAN FOOTBALL 
Hawaiia n football can best be 

described with two words : emotion 
and skill. This year' teams typify 
both of these requirements and have 
been the most spirited bunch of haoles 
to play the sport at UCSD since it was 
introduced by King Kamehameha 
himself back in 1845. The season's top 
rated Leam, the Dolphins al·c led by the 
qj.lick footwork of All-Hawuii backs 
Drew Tunzman and J .C. Cornfield. 
Jeff ··Hoola-Hoola" Puchulski adds a 
unique dimension to the Dulphins 
when he i ·n·t visiting the infirmury Cor

BOWL chumpionship are the sky-high 
boys from Hcroin , the Kailua K<lrrot

Triton 
Swimmers 
Top 'Poor' 
Schools 

By Jon Goetz 
Senior &aft Wrl&er 

Though still far behind the 
top echelon of NAIA swimmine 
schools, UCSD finished 10th in 
~ast weekend's Nationals, their 
best finish ever. 

For the eighth year in a row 
the American NAJA swimming 
champion was Simon Fraser 
University of Canada with 449 
points. The Tritons trailed with 
59 points, still beating out 
another 42 teams at the meet. 

With 20 more schools at the 
1979 competition than in 1978 
the race times quickened 
accordingly. The NAIA · 
winning times roughly equal 
NCAA Division II top clocklngs 
now. 

UCSD times were faster also 
with almost every schooi 
record broken at the meet. The 
top ten finish is quite a feat 
being the only non-scholarship 
team represented in the first 
ten or twenty places. 

As with last year, four 
Tritons earned All-American 
ratings. Freshman Nelson 
Howard swam to a national 
ranking for his first time, and 
Joe Hernandez, Mark Allen, 
and Lance Halsted repeated 
last year's honors. The top 12 in 
each race earn this distinction, 
and these four did it twice in the 
800 and 400 free relays. 

The 800 free team placed 
seventh, and Hernandez ' 200 
split time bettered the national 
200 record. The 400 time of 
3: 14.74 was good for tenth 
place, as Hernandez' split set a 
school record and Allen 's 48.5 
100 set a personal best. 

Allen also took All-American 
status in the 200 back with his 
school record breaking 2: 00.50 
swjm. Halsted took eighth 
place in the 1650 in 16: 41. 78, 
beating his 1978 14th place 
showing. He also took seventh 
in the 500 free by winning the 
consolation heat in a time of 
4:44.6. 

Hernandez earned AlI-
American ratings in all three of 
his individual events, in 
addition to the relays. Leading 
the 200 free field after 175 
ya rds , he got touched out at the 
end to finish third. He took a 
fifth in the 100 free with a 47.38 
time, and finished lOth in the 
500 behind Halsted. 

No one else made the top 
twelve, though the 'toO medley 
relay team missed the finals 
with their 13th place finish , and 
Greg McGary barely missed 
twelfth in both the 10e and 200 
breast races . 

The co nditions at the 
Hun.tsville , Alabama pool 
helped quicken the times at the 
meet. " It was unbelieva bly 
exciting because there were so 
many people there ," said 
Coach Bill Morgan.

Doyle's Holmes and Watson 
Plummer, Mason Tops 
In 'Murder By Decree" 

By Beth Accomando 
Staff Writer 

In 1903 Sherlock Holmes 
became the rlrst detective to be 
transferred to the screen, Since 
then actors as diverse as John 
Barrymore, Basil Rathbone, 
and Christopher Lee have 
played the famous detective, 
yet none of them has captured 
the true nature of the Holmes 
that Sir Arther Conan Doyle 
created in his stories , More 
often than not Holmes is played 
as an aloof and stm intel-
lectual. too cold to win our 
complete aCfection. Sur-
prisingly, though, inMurderBy 
Decree Christopher Plummer 
and James Mason oHer the best 
and most enjoyable personi-
fications oC Holmes and Dr. 
Watson, Unfortunately, these 
excellent portraits are framed 

in a disappointing plot about 
J ack the Ripper. 

With Sherlock "Holmes and 
Dr. Watson, Doyle created one 
of the best loved detective 
teams oC all time. Doyle's 
Holmes was a charming 
character of extreme intel-
ligence. He also had little 
eccentricities, such as playing 
the violin, which Cleshed out his 
character and made him more 
human. 

In Murder By Decree . 
Plummer gives us the Holmes 
of Doyle's stories . Plummer's 
Holmes is not a stufCy snob, but 
rather a sensitive and 
perceptive man oC action. 
Plummer is the first actor to 
deliver a truly well-rounded 
and fascinating portrait of 
Holmes. As Holmes ' foil Dr.

Dirk just stared at the bubbling batter with eyes as wide as half-
dollars, his mouth hanging open as though in some awe-struck 
stupor usually associated with religious Canatics who habitually 
receive relevations from God as they suds their bodies in the 
shower. He cracked his knuckles. the fifth time in five minutes, 
and licked his lips. Bette oCfered him some coffee. 

"No thanks. " he said, shaking his head and holding his hand 
over his cup, " too wired already ..... He looked at the Home 
Federal Savings special San Diego calendar and made note of the 
date: Sunday, March 4,1979. " .. . Sundays are always the same for 
me. Don't have to go to work , sleep late, drink coHee into the late 
afternoon until it Ceels like my head's being shaved with a wood 
plane, watch TV or go back to sleep ..... He pushed up his shirt 
sleeve and looked at his watch ...... 4 pm. Time to stop drinking 
cofCee and do something ... but what. .. ?" 

Bette scraped the half-cooked flapjacks from the pan and 
slapped them on the plates, two slabs apiece. They kissed the 
plates with a wet sound, like a water balloon dropped from the 
third floor oC an office building, heard from across the street. She 
took the plates to the table and set both of them in front of the 
seated Dirk. He just looked at them and let his glasses slide down 
his nose until they pinched his nostrils, cutting oCf his breathing. 

" ... but what?" He was still muttering to himself as hecrammed 
a portion of the table cloth down the front of his shirt. .. .. . but 
what??" The tone oC his voice hardened like a fist, a fresh plaster 
cast or old bread leCt for the birds. He slam med his £ist on the ta ble. 
Sugar spilled from , the sugar bowl. CoHee spilled in fitful drops 
from their cups . The syrup shimmied like his sister Kate. Sugar, 
spurred on by a flurry of meaningless hand gestures that Dirk was 
wont to do, spilled on the floor and spread over the two tone tile like 
now pat Crom a snow plow. He picked up the pancakes, plates 

and all , and threw them at the wall. Bits of plate stuck with the 
uncooked batter for a Cew seconds, and then fell to the noor with 
the rest of the scorched goo and shattered china. 

" More coHee?" asked Bette . 
.. Sure ..... 
" Too bad, I drank the last drop. Hah-Hah. " Her laugh was as 

obnoxious as an asthmatic whistling the entire score of Oklahoma 
into a telephone, with a suicide hot line center on the other end .. 

Dirk cracked his neck with a snap, Bette put the cat into the 
microwave, ' 'I'm tired of drying the cat by hand," she said, setting 
the timer and pressing the "on" button. The two ofthem held each 
other around the waist a nd watched through the window, ignoring 
a ticker on the door that warned against radiation. The cat's body 
inClated. The eyes bubbled up like soap suds or boiling soup, a nd 
then turned into runny , sizzling goo. Then there was an explosion. 
The inside of the microwave turned red.

Plummer and Mason make a

and thcy develop a strong 
rapport that makcs their

their scenes classic. 

The exce ll enc of the ca t.

script. One of the primary 
clements oC the dctective genre 
is a well -con tructed plot, 
clever and intricate but finally 
satisfying. Doyle ' stories 
consistently represented the 
best oC this genre. but Murder 
By Decree rejects Doyle 's 
stories and turns to screen-
wl'iter John Hopkins to invent a

Fraz e Won't 
Sup ort Bill 

I 

Says He Doesn't 'Owe 
Students' One Despite Vote 
(Conlinued from page I) 

Frazee also points to two 
other "flaws" in the bill : he 
says students are not "stable 
tenants," thus hurting land-
lords looking for long-term 
leases, and he thinks problems 
will arise because the bill 
doesn't define "student." "The 
definition will just have to be 
left up to the courts under this 
bill, and I don't want that," 
Frazee says. 

The bill has been heavily 
lobbied by both the real estate 
and UC student lobby. Frazee 
says, and while he acknowl-
edges that lobbyists sometimes 
innuence his decision on issues, 
he adds , "without hearing from 
anyone, I probably would have 

come to thp . ame conclusion" 
on AB 224. 

"Owing the Stud ents" 
Frazee's almost certain "no" 

vote on the bill has worried 
UCSD Lobby Annex Director 
Linda Sabo, but she thinks the 
vote will have at least one 
positive effect. 

.. (Frazee) looks like he is 
aware that we're here, that we 
are something that he has to 
deal with. By not voting for us 
on the housing bill, he owe u 
one, and might \'ote with us on 
something else," Sabo says. 

But Frazee says, " I don't 
operate that way .. .! weigh 
every issue separately and I'll 
listen to the students on 
anything. "

'Soft' Energy Cut? 
Appropriate Technology May Get No Funds 

By Vidya Tolani 
Staff Writer 

The UC Appropriate Tech-
nology Program, recently 
founded at UC Davis to provide 
practical alternatives to 
current national levels of 
resource consumption, may be 
discontinued due to lack of 
funds. 

The ATP, funded by t~e 
Ca lifornia legislature , IS 
presently having its next year's 
budget reviewed, according to 
Connie Laux, program 
administrative assistant. Laux 
added that the program at 
present has "very little money 
left." Director Paul Craig 
explained that because the 
Ilegislature is faCing cutbacks 
due to Proposition 13, it will 
review the ATP's budget more 
carefully. 

Craig noted that since the 

ATP is a " new program in a 
controversial area," it is 
" more vulnerable than most. " 
He added that the one and a 
half-yea r -o ld program is 
.. interdisciplinary" a nd thus 
"takes a long time to solidify." 

Walter Schmidt, a UCSD 
representative to the program , 
explained that the ATP lacks 
senior faculty who could bUract 
more funding. " They are all 
facing their own cutbacks from 
Proposition 13," he said. 

Due to this fund shortage, the 
ATP can no longer accept 
requests to sponsor projects, 
according to Craig. The 
organization has sponsored 47 
student and staff projects to 
date, including production of 
methane gas from waste 
material , teaching low-income 
Oakland home owners to 
rehabilitate their houses, and

creating an energy efficient 
refrigerator. 

Schmidt remarked that ' the 
organization looks for projects 
involving " innovative kinds of 
questions" with a "setting 
where a result could be really 
applicable (to consumers) at a 
moderate cost." 

He added that most projects 
are on a small-scale basis 
because of funding limitations. 

Up to present, there have 
.been no ATP projects done by 
UCSD students or staff. But 
Professor Leonard Leiberman 
of the Physics Department will 
work on a project this summer 
involving the fabrication of a 
special plate to convert solar 
energy into hydrogen.

The high point will be the 

United State Cycling Feder-
ation Class One and Two race, a 
42 mile (35 lap) test starting at 
12: 15. 

The San Diego area has a 
reputation for well -r un 
tournaments which will help 
attract top rider from as far 
away as Colorado, Patterson 
said . The San Diego Bicycling 
Club, as 'Well as UCSD 
Recreational Athletics , is 
helping to run the race . 

San Diego also has relatively 
few race (six or even) every 
year. which helps in getting 
bu ine e to donate prize , 
Patterson said. 

The biggest i the 75-mile 
Tecate to Ensenada race 
chedul d for March 25. for 

wh ich over 5000 rid r ar 
expected. 

"There's kind of a bicycling 
fever this time of year. " 
Patterson explained. 

The bicycling team here. in 

cationa 
Institute 

of LI1 JoIIe 

its third year, will " probably" 
face Irvine, Santa Barbara 
and Stanford, and po ibly ~ 
few other schools, Patter on 
said. 

They will compete in six 
races thiS year, including the 

~ntercollegiate Championships 
In Santa Croz April 22. 

The coach hesitated about 
predicting the team's succe s 
this season . UCSD's most 
successful rider from the past 
will not be on the team , but 011 
the other hand this is the first 
year they've had a real coach. 

Patterson said he is 
de igning a program to get 
beginners in a trainillg 
ch dule and work them in 

quickly. 
The races Satu rday may play 

a very important part ill that 
plan . Patter on i hoping the 
UC D event will help in 
recruiting new rider . 
Interested cycli t hould 
inquire tit the CSD Bicycle 

hop in the Student Center.

Stronski believes that 

Iranian Students 
(Coadaued from pale 1) 
present regime, if it does not order people to change too much, but 
worries that the country may become communist. If it does , he 
would not go back. 

Haroutunian also aid he did not realize until lately "what the 
Shah did," and knew very little about politics in Iran. 

This is common among Iranians, contrary to their image. Many 
confess to ignorance about the political tate of their country, at 
least before rioting began last summer. 

In adclition to the activist Moslem and the neutral "silent 
majority" a third group exists which has been re ponsible for 
much of th Iranian tudent' radical image. Organized a. the 
Iranian tudents As ociation, they are leW ts seeking a Marxi t 
style revolution. 

Until the Sbah left the countl'y, th y had a much nigher profile 
than the Mosl m student' group, although both held 
demon tration around Southern alifornia: 

Now, many tudents have gon hom to parti ipate in internal 
politics, according to Winnie Cha e, advi er to foreign students at 
SDSU . They ri k not being allowed to return to America by the 
Immigration Department. he said, although SDSU would 
readmit them. 

The threat of the immigration service cancelling their visas 
hangs over the heads of " non-immigrant" or temporary, foreign 
tudents at all time . Two of the students whose names were 

withheld from this series were technically violating immigration 
law by failing to regi tel' for clas e , (due to lack of funds) . 

Following the Beverly Hill ' incident, it was discovered by 
Attorney General Griffin Bell (under pI' ure by Pre ident 
Carter) that the immigration ervic in this area was as much a 
six month behind in processing paperwork for the Good of 
students entering the S from the Middle Ea t. 

Sub equently, the individual colleges and univer ities have been 
given respon ibility for making sure that foreigners in the country 
on tudent visa are actually enrolled and working on their 
cla ses. . 

" We' ll have to talk to each of them at lea 1 once a year, Chase 
r. id. " I don 't like enforcement, finding out why someone i 
dropping a cour e, and that ort of thing, but that's what the law 
require ." 

She didn ' t mention it, but her supervisor might actually help the 
Ir ... "lians, as it becomes evident that most Iranian students are 

hard""l)rkin~ and mainly interested in getting an education.

Legal Services Working 
On Better, Faster Aid 

By Sam Gooch 
Attorney Raph Levens o( 

UCSD Legal Services has taken 
action to provide students with 
improved and quicker acce to 
legal a si tan e. . 

. ' I spend one-fourth to one-
third of my lime advi ing 
administrative departm nt 

uch a Financial Aid and 
tudent Arrair,, " aid Leven . 

" ( would like to be able to 
devote my elf full time to 

tudents' legal problems." 
Although few student 

complaints are made of the 
ervice, Leven aid , he sees a 

need for more time to work with 
student. "The com\?laints I 
get, which ( admit to freely ," 
remark d Leven , "are that 
ouroffi 'e i ometime too slow 
in dealing with students' 
problems. The explanation is 
that there' one lawyer for 
10,000 tudents." 

"I see about 1300 to 1400 
tudent u year," he added, 

.. and of the e we average only 
about 10 complaints. " 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affair Richard Armitage 
backed up Leven ' claim, 
aying that " there are very few 

complaint, that's true." 
Carroll Wills of the Reg. Fee 

Committee, which provides an 

open forum for student 
grievances , s'aid of Legal 
Services, "We haven 't receiv d 
any complaints that I know of. " 
Third College student repr -
sentative to Reg tee Com-
mittee Martha Mangold tated 
that , "I've alway heard that 
(Levens) doe a good job. ,. 

" The lack of complaints does 
not mean that a eriou 
problem doe noC exi t ," said 
Levens. who al 0 devote 
much of hi free time to legal 
difficulties of students. Levens 
often get up in the middle of 
the night to post bail for 
student . " Sometimes I don't 
have time to do as good ajob as 
I could," he 'aid. 

In la t year's annual report 
and in hi budget request for the 
1979-80 academic year, Leven 
took step to allow for more 
time to counsel student b 
calling for in rea ed funding 
and/or a change in his job 
description. 

In hi budget propo 'al , 
Leven requested an $8724.00 
increase over la t year to pay 
the alary for an additional 
clerk typist. Levens hopes that 
adding a new member to the 
administrative staff would free 
Mary Virga, a third year law
