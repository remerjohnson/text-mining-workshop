Racial Discussion Ends 
In Confrontation 

The designation by the AS Sen-
ate of last Friday as a day of 
racial discussion in honor of 
Malcolm X, whose birthday was 
the 19th, had various effects upon 
the UCSD community, the most 
dramatic of which was a con-
frontation between Provost Salt-
man and several students. 

At a noon rally participants 
were able to test amplificati on 
equipment which is being per-
mitted on a trial basis. Pro-
fessor Popkin spoke briefly olthe 
need to change the educational 
system, both by educating Ameri-
cans concerning racial problems, 
and by permitting a co-equality 
of cultures.

Symposium 
on Draft 
To Be Held 

Provost Saltman announced this 
week that as a result of the deep 
concern the University feels con-
cerning the effects which the 
present draft laws are having 
and will have on the students on 
campus, there will be a sym-
posium on the draft conducted on 
campus during the next two 
weeks. Many prominent figures 
connected with and interested in 
the Selective Service System have 

en lined up to lecture and dis-
cuss the draft, its effects and 
various methods by which the 
student can approach this prob-
lem. 

On May 28 at 7:30 p.m. the

The Board of Regents decided 
to contribute one million dollars 
of the new revenue from the 
University Registration Fee to 
Educational Opportunities Pro-
grams. 

The Regents .took this action 
last Thursday during a meeting 
on Educational Policy in Santa 
Barbara. This new revenue will 
be added to the more than eight 
thousand dollars already devoted 
to EOP. 

President Hitch also reported 
that another million is being held 
until it can be determined how 
best to use the money. Hitch 
said that once the funds have 
been allocated to each campus, 
it should be a campus matter. 
"We are not proposing a single 
system throughout the University 
to distribute the funds," Hitch 
said. 

In addition, President Hitch 
disclosed a survey by the South-
ern Education Foundation which 
reported that the University of 
California "is doing more than 
any other state university system 
in providing disadvantaged stu-
dents a chance for college educa-
tion." 

In other action, the Regents 
indicated that there might be a 
cut in enrollment of undergradu-
ates beginning in the fall of 
1969. This cut would b the 
result of trying to achieve a 
40:60 ratio of lower to upper 
division students. The proj ctlon 
is that "as many as 10,000 lower

Davis Students 
Present Demands 

About 200 students from the 
Davis campus of the University 
of California attended the Board 
of Regents meeting in Santa Bar-
bara to present a list of demands 
for aid to minorities. 

They proposed creation of a 
committee that "would be charg-
ed with finding an effective pro-
gram for altering the ethnic and 
income class distribution of the 
University's student population, 
and th ethnic distribution of its 
administration and faculty, so

and one administrator. on facul-

from each campus would be from 
a minority or low income group. 

President stamos of Santa Bar-
bara said that the committee must 
be permanent and would be an 
advisory committe only. 

Chancellor Murphy of tlCLA 
and President /1arles Hitch 
agreed that th r was om m r-
it in the plan, but di pproved

from numerous Universities and 
Colleges throughout the United 
states and Europe. Presiding at 
the Inauguration ceremony was 
Dr. Franklin Murphy, Chancellor 
of UCLA, 

Central to Hitch's theme was 
the notion that increased cooper-
ation between udents and ad-
ministration is absolutely nece-
ssary to the solution of th pre-
sent difficulties in the Univer-
sity of California system. 

While praising the niversity

Guest Editorial 
Let"s Start Thinlcing About A Chancellor 

An Academic Senate Committee is currently in 
the process of trying to find a new Chancellor for 
UCSD. The Associated Students have obtained the 
previlege of making suggestions to the committee 
through the President of the Academic Senate. 
The following are characteristics which the Asso-
ciated students have already suggested as impor-
ones to be sought in the choosing of the new Chan-
cellor: 

Professionai administrators like Roger Heyns 
at Berkeley are by nature antagonistic toward 
students. We therefore recommend the appoint-
ment of an educator who is less apt to view the 
post as a battle between himself and the students. 

The new Chancellor should becourageousenough 
to be outspoken on subjects about which he feels 
strongly. 
It will be necessary for tho Chancellor to take 
the initiative and go out of his way to insure 
adequate communication between his office the 
University community, and the outside com~un­
ity. 

The A.S recognizes the importance of removing 
the appointment from political considerations, 
but we feel one exception is vital. Conservatism 
in California has come to be synonomous with 

misunderstanding concerning the pupose of the 
University of California. We therefore believe 
that the appointment of a conservative Chancel-
lor (despite political expediancy that would be 
involved by satisfying many Reagan-following 
Californians) is not in the best interests of the 
University. 

The A.S. would like to encourage suggestions and 
additions to these recommendations. These may take 
the form of desirable characteristics or of actual 
names you would like considered. Please contact 
us at 453-2000 ext. 1917 between 9 and 12 am.

Stud ent Questions Dismissal 
Of Mattox at San Diego 
Editor, Triton Times: 

Recently a survey was released 
which showed that only 5% of the 
faculty in colleges in California 
were registered Republican. With 
that in mind, consider the case 
of Dr. Paul who is being dismiss-
ed as a professor at San Diego 
State College. Reprinted below 
is a circular explaining his case. 

Sincerely, 
Randv Erickson 

ITEM: Dr. Mattox is the only 
active Republican in the SDSC 
Speech Department. Dr. Mattox 
was told that there Is no r oom 
for his kind of pOlitical ideas in 
the speech department. 
QUESTION: Is academic freedom 
now being defined as the privilege 
of agreeing with one's col-
leagues? 
ITEM: Ina campus hearing secret 
testimony and documents were 
used as the basis for the decision 
not to retain Dr. Mattox. He was 
denied the right of access to 
secret testimony and documents. 
QUESTION: Is this basic justice 
or 20th century inquisition? 
ITEM: Dr. Mattox was warned 
that infor mation in the secret 
files would be made "available" 
to prospective employers, should 
he protest his dismissal. 
QUESTION: Is threat and black-
mail a part of the academic pro-
cess in a free society? 
ITEM: Gossip about Prof. Mat-
tox's private life, including his 
marriage and divorce was spe-
cifically solicited from associ-
ates and former Instructors for 
the express purpose of harass-
ment and character assassina-
tion. 
QUESTION: Who is afraid of an 
open hearing? 

lf you believe as I do, and 
YAF does, demand an open hear-
ing before Asst. Chancellor C. 
Mansel Keene (5670 Wilshire 

Blvd., Los Angeles, CalU,90036,

Editor, the Triton Times: 
In your article on Trident 

Christian Fellowship's panel on 
"The Passover Plot" you stated 
that ". . .the proposition of 
Christ being an ordinary man is 
not proven by Dr. Schonfield's 
book, but doubt is shown and the 
burden of proof for Jesus' divinity 
is put upon Christians." 

Actually, that's not quite cor-
rect. The burden of presentation 
is and always has been on Chris-
tians, but if Christianity Is true 
then one would expect God to 
provide the proof. The error of 
many people is thatthey conclude 
that this proof does not exist; the 
error is compounded when they 
talk themselves into believing 
that pu rely intellectual argu-
ments about God will satisfy them 
one way or the other. 

The brand of Christianity that 
Jesus taught does offer both ob-
jective and subjective proof, but 
it also presupposes more than 
just a passive listener. A person 
can say "I'm not convinced" and 
really mean "I don't want to be 
convinced because if 1 am then 
I'll have to act on it." On the 
other hand, a person can really 
be wondering just how Jesus 
Christ can possibly be relevant 
and meaningful in student Ute at 
UCSD. I am only one of many stu-
dents who'd be glad to share 
what we've discovered.

Hypocrisy Deplored 
Editor, The Triton Times, 

It is a disaster to education if 
school teaches hypocrisy and dis-
honesty; and it is a tragedy to 
the humanities if a democratic 
country is ruled under dictator-
ship. The Administration of this 
Institute of "Higher Education", 
in this democratic country, 
teaches not Humanities or Cal-
culus, but Hypocrisy and Dic-
tatorship. 

Last Friday, (May 10)the resi-
dent students in Revelle College 
were ASKED to vote on a refer-
endum pertaining to next aca-
demic year's Housing Plan. 
Overwhelmingly, (72%) the stu-
dents rejected the proposed 
"Comoulsory Integration Plan". 
despite the will of the sub-
stantial majority of students, and 
ignoring the Constitutions, the 
Administration went ahead to a-

dopt and enforce tbe rejected 
plan. 

Undoubtely, the idea of "inte-
gration" is basically sound, and 
1 personally am also in favor of 
the Plan. But, more importantly, 
students' will must also be re-
spected. Any plan rejected by the 
majority should not be adopted 
inspite of its goodness. 

1 do not intend to question the 
Administration's right and power 
in this case. Since the Admini-
stration is all-powerful, it can 
even " fix" roommates tor any-
one of us if it so desires. Anyone 
who dislikes the Administration 
should leave this place because 
this is the Administration's Uni-
ver sity. But I do wish to under-
stand why a vote was called if the 
Administration had already de-
cided. The majority of students 
who voted "NO" last Friday 

would not only feel that they have 
been cheated, their self-esteem 

has . been hurt, but would also 
wonder the educational objective 
of the great University. I wish 
to ask if the Administration is 
setting a good example, to us, 
the future adminlstrators,----
"the application of hypocrisy and 
dishonesty". Perhaps, this is the 
"unique" characteristic of Re-
velle College in parallel to its 
famed "unique" Humanities Se-
quence. 

The reputation of the Admini-
stration has long gone, the Inter-
Hall Council is dead, the student 
"rights" are being buried and our 
time, eUort and money spent for 
an education in this great Uni-
versity of California ,are mean-
ingless. 

Sincerely, 
Louis Liang

Stud ents Reject 
Dorm Proposals 

In a vote taken Friday by the 
Resident Dean's office, the pro-
posals outlined In last week's 
Triton Times were voted down 
by over 200 votes. Next yearwill 
see the presant dorm set-up 
in operation again. 

Among the proposals was one 
that would, in effect, eliminate 
the upper division dorm. This was 
voted against by a vast majority 
of the 65% of the resident stu-
dents who cast their ballot in 
the vote. The turnout was one 
of the largest at Revelle. There-
fore, next year, Beagle and Dis-
covery halls will be the upper 
division men and women's halls. 
The proposals for coed dorms did 
not receive sufficient support to 
warrant the setting up of one 
such dorm. 

Signing up for dorms and rooms 
will take place this week in ac-
cordance with the notice that 
all resident students received 
from the Resident Dean's office. 
Priorities go to upperclassmen 
and returning students over 10-
werclassmen and those who lived 
off campus this year. Large 
groups will not need to draw 
numbers to be assigned to a 
dorm, but single persons not 
affiliated with any particular 
groups will use a lottery sys-
tem to receive their rooms out 
of the ones lett over when the 
larger groups have been given 
a dorm.

advantage over a new committee 
in that they can begin work im-
mediately, while the committee 
is yet to be organized. 

Hitch said that student partici-
pation on the campus level would 
be a better Idea. . 

President Woodside of Davis 
also wanted anincreasein grants 
costing nearly 3 million dollars. 
Later he clarified his demand 
and said that they money should 
'come from outside sources, not 
from University funds. 

After the meeting, Hitch was 
asked if the new revenue from 
the fee increase would go back 
to the campus where it had origi-
nated. 

Hitch said that with two ex-
ceptions it WOUld. Those two ex-
ceptions are 1) a million dollars 
apportioned by the President on 
the basis of which programs need 
money the most; 2) money to fi-
nance the administration of the 
new programs. 

Hitch said that one of the 
problems of starting new pro-
grams was the lack of qualified 
persons. For that reason he 
stressed, in his report to the 
Regents, the need to extend aid 
to secondary and elementary 
schools. Aiso for that reason 
they raised the percentage of 
students for whom the admittance 
requirements could be waived 
from 2% to 4%. 
Davis' 

Propolsa/s

Continued fro~ nane 1 
could be gained from Univer-
sity funds if they were appropri-
ately Invested. Atter several mi-
nutes of discussion, the Regents 
decided to defer the matter until 
next month. 

In an unprecedented action, the 
Board agreed to hear student 
Presidents of UC Davis and UC 
Santa Barbara make proposal 
for a permanent committee with 
student representation to advise 
the Board. Regent Rafferty was 
the main supporter of the pro-
posal.

Fromm VS, Marcuse 

Psychologist Observes 
Dehumanized Society 

In a prepared speech delivered 
Monday evening, famed psycho-
analyst and sociologist Erich 
Fromm lent his support to Sena-
tor Eugene J. McCarthy in his 
bid for for the Presidency. The 
speech was sponsored by the San 
Diego County McCarthy for Pres-
ident Committee. 

The malar portion of Fromm's 

.. Eros and Civilization". Ac-
cusing Marcuse of offering a 
"nebulous solution," Fromm 
went on to say that certain Mar-
cusian notions are due to a mis-
understanding of Freudian the-
ory. For example, the idea of 
non-repressive sublimation is 
inconsistent with Freudian the-
ories of sexuality, according to 
Fromm. (For those interested, a 
Marcusian critique of Fromm 
can be found in the epilogue of 
"Eros and Civilization). Fromm 
concludes his discussion of in-
dustrial society on a peSSimistic 
note.

conce rning hippie lite. -Staff photo 

speech was concerned with an 
analysis of modern technological 
society. Claiming societies such 
as the United states to be on the 
brink of the "second Industrial 
Revolution," in which thought is 
supplied by machines rather than 
men, Fromm unleashed a scath-
ing indictment of highly deve loped 
industrial society. Man, he as-
serted, has become dehumanized, 
incapable of feeling joy or sor-
row. This dehumanization is re-
flected by man's craving for ob-
jects, such as cars, clothes, and 
books. Indeed, sex itself has be-
come a commodity for consump-
tion, Fromm added. This fetish-
ism for consumption is also man-
ifested by leisure time activities 

The possibility of solving the 
problems inherent in modern 
society is slight, Fromm stated, 
but if it is even to be attempted, 
the election of Senator McCarthy 
is imperative. Describing Mc-
Carthy as a " totally honest man" 
who has not yet been mechanized 
by technocracy, Fromm claims 
that McCarthy is the only candi-
date sensitive to this situation. 
While generally avoiding discus-
sion of any particular iss ue , 
Fromm asserted that McCarthy 
would achieve results which 
would strike at the roots of the 
problems in the United States. 
For example, in regard to iet-
nam, Fromm unqualifiedly stated 
that if McCarthy were elected, 
the war would quickly end. 
Fromm felt that present peace 
talks are not meant to achieve 
any meaninglful results. In ad-
dition, Fromm accused Senator 
Robert Kennedy of insincerity and 
of lacking any deep convictions. 
He concluded his remarks by 
appealing to citizens to become 
socially responsible and aware 
of public problems. He urged 
the audience to support and par-
ticipate in the McCarthy cam-
paign. 

Yablonsky 
O f Hippie 

Speaks 
Life 

Dr. Lewis Yablonsky, Chair-
man of the Department of Sociol-
ogy at San Fernando Valley State 
College and member of the Board 
of Directors at Synanon, spoke 
this week about the hippie phe-
nomenon in the United States . 
Sponsored by the Guest-in-Resi-
dence Committee, Yablonsky re-
ported on what he had seen and 
heard while traveling through 
various hippie locales in prep-
aration for his book, "The Hippie 
Trip." 

He began by describing from 
a "square sociologist's" point 
of view the two types of places 
he had visited. In the city, he 
stayed at Galahad's Pad in the 
East Village of New York City. 
The conditions were classed as 
SUb-poverty. The building, which 
should have been condemned, was 
composed of eight communes, 
each with three greasy mattress-
es on the floor upon which eight 
warm bodies resided on a twenty-
four hour basis . 

On the rural scene, places like 
Big Sur and Morning star, Yab-
lonsky observed that evprything 
was chaotic and disorganized. 
There was no relaxing atmos-
phere in these "unlove" com-
munities. 

He then reported on the Hippie 
Phenomenon as a social move-
ment. Unlike preceding move-
ments which attack specific as-
pects of society, the hippies have 
turned away from all American 
institutions as they stand today. 
In place of the American family 
with its one mother, its one 
father, and its 2.8 children, the 
hippies have substituted a tribal 
set-up with multiple mothers and 
fathers. Educationally, they feel 
that they can learn more by drop-
ping out and tuning in than by 
continuing in society's institu-
tions. They have Aried, not very 
successfully, to replace the 
American economy with a barter 
structure and have tried to be-
come more closely oriented to 
the land. 

Politically, the hippie philoso-
phy of letting everyone do his own 
thing directly opposes the es-
tablished system. They try to 
leave everything up to the in-
dividual; their governments are 
therefore very disorganized. 
Hippies also reject the Judaic-
Christian status of organizedre-
l1gion, as well as most Eastern 
cults. Instead, they seek new 
self-awareness and und.erstand-
ing through the use of drugs, 
which are used as religious sac-
raments by many. 

During a question and answer 
period that followed, Dr. Yab-
lonsky described the kinds of 
hippies within the movement. 8 

per cent are ideal hippies who 
use drugs religiously, have noth-
ing to do with the establishment, 
and search for some self-identi-
ty. Forty per cent are novices 
who do not have the certainty 
about what they are doing which is 
characteristic of the ideal hip-
pies. Another 40% are the plastic 
or weekend hippies. They are not 
really part of the hippie move-
ment. The final 20% are "Clark 
Kent" hippies, the researching 
college professors, reporters, 
and sociologists in disguise. 

He ventured that the hippie 
movement began as a total re-
jection of the "plastic" society 
where mechanistic man has over-
come the spontaneous and loving 
man. It is a radical reaction to 
the machine-like, unhuman soci-
ety of today. As to their future, 
Dr . Yablonsky guessed that this 
summer would indicate the con-
tinuation or the death of the hip-
pie movement. 

which depend upon "program-
med amusements" such as those 
found at places like Disneyland. 
Man seeks these diversions in 
order to avoid the "disastrous 
prospect" of spending time with 
himself, occupied by his own 
self-directed activities. Fromm 
contends that this dehumanization 
is a direct r esult of the exalted 
status which is given to the 
machine by industrial society. 
Indeed, man himself has become 
nothing more than a cog in the 
vast machinery of society. Thus, 
Fromm views industrial society 
as an incredible Frankenstein, in 
which man has ceased to exist. 

In his discussion of various 
suggested solutions to the prob-
lems of industrial society, 
Fromm criticized the ideas of 
UCSD Professor Herbert Mar-
cuse, as set forth in his book,

Berkeley Group Holds Rally 
Last Friday a crowd of around 

8,000 gathered on the steps of 
sproul Hall at the Berkeleycam-
pus to participate in a rally 
honoring 737 students who an-
nounced that they will refuse 
military service. 

This event, billed as a "com-
mencement exercise," climaxed 
several weeks of behind-the-
scene maneuvering and confron-
tations between the sponsors of 
the event, COO (Campus Draft 
Opposition), Chancellor Heyns, 
the Board of Regents, and Gov-
ernor Reagan. 

COO had originally scheduled 
the event for May 16 in the Greek 
Theatre, and had enlisted con-
siderable faculty support. Their 
initial request to use this facility 

was referred by Chancellor 
Heyns to the Regents attorney. 
He advised Heyns to refuse the 
request, since allowing COO to 
use the Greek theatre, he felt, 
would seem to give official cam-
pus sanction to the event. Also, he 
thought that there was a chance 
that the law might be broken at 
such a rally. 

On the basis of this recom-
mendation, the Regents denied 
use of the facility. However, 
Heyns, dissatisfied with this 
reasoning, consulted the law dept. 
at Berkeley. Their recommenda-
tion was that there was no reason 
to believe that there was any 
more chance that the law would be 
broken at the COO rally than there 
was at any of the rallys that take 

place almost daily in the plaza 
area. 

However, at the Davis Regents 
meeting, which took place last 
month, the original decision was 
re-affirmed. 

Subsequently, CDO hired a law-
yer and filed tor an injunction 
which would require the Rel!er!ts 
to show cause why the Greek 
theatre facility should be denied 
them. An amicus brief was also 
filed, signed by most of the AS 
presidents of the UC system, 
UCSD included. 

The request for the injunction 
was denied by a Federal Circuit 
Court in San Francisco. As a 
result, COO rescheduled the 
event as part of a noon rally at 
Sproul Hall. The rally took place 
as scheduled with no disturb-
ances. 

Just ci Man, But He Was There Chancellor Heyns has since stated that as far as he is con-cerned the activities of Friday May 17 were entirely legal.

1 didn't expect to see him there. 
Anthropologists call it pot-

latch. And we call the people 
who practice it primitives. A 
man gathers all the material 
wealth he can. He measures his 
wealth in whale oil or seal skins. 
He invites his most pretentious 
rival to a feast and burns every-
thing. 

Humbled, the rival starts col-
lecting whale oil to reciprocate. 

This was a Hollywood party. A 
man was burning his whale oil 
before more than 200 rivals. I 
had not been invited, but it was 
an uncle's party and I had asked 
to go. 

I wanted only to look. To sit 
for an evening in quiet contempt. 
To watch in safe aloofness as the 
people performed for mt>. 

But I didn't expect to see him 
there. 

It went as planned, at first. My 
contempt seemed impenetrable. 
I could not be impressed because 
they were all flawed. 

Abby Lane looked coarse. 
Mel Torme looked old. 
Annette F'unicello looked aver-

age. 
Marlo Thomas looked emaciat-

ed. 
But I hardly expected to see 

him there. 
They all seemed to be s wirling 

in a vortex of self. 
And I just watched. Secure. 

Guarded. I was convinced that no 
one in that room that night was 
capable of any real display of 
'emoti:m, least of all me. 

That's why I didn't expect to 
see him there. Because I didn't 
think I could be impressed by 
anything at that party. That 
wasn't the plar. 

But then I didn't expect to see 
James Baldw n there. Just a 
man. But I ct ase to be impres-
sed DOW. He could write the wat. 

1 wanted to. And I felt I knew 
him very well. He had bared 
himself to me across thousands 
of pages and I respected him. 

My pomposity was punctured. 
The insulation, the immunity 
were gone. [ was a fan. 

"Hello Mr. Baldwin, - and I 
introduce myself, offering my 
hand. 

He is a slight man and his 
grasp is not firm. I tell him 
that my only claim to fame is 
that I am the host's nephew, 

He doesn't react. His expres-
sion is fixed. But he continues 
to shake my hand. 

Baldwin is with a tall. beaut-
iful black man who leans toward 
me, "What did you say your 
name is?-

I tell him. 
"That's your only claim to 

fame.-
I smile and turn back to 8ald-

win. He still shakes my hand but 
says nothing. Out of nervousness 
I start to babble, 

·You're one olmy folk heroes,-
Nothing. It seems he will hold 

my hand interminably. 
O[ really admire your work.-
He s queezes harder when I 

say something he likes, but he 
still says nothing. I begin to 
think about "Giovanni's Room-. 

I want to ask him if he will 
have any time to talk to me 
at length later in the evening 
but the instant I say it I know 
it has come out wrong---"What 
are you doing tonight?-

"Right after the party I'm leav-
ing for Martin's funeral. n These 
are the first words I hear him 
speak. They are said slowly, sol-
emnly, rhythmically. Baldwin 
pronounces each word carefully. 
He has punctuated my monologue 
at him with one sentence and we 
separate to our respective tables 
for dinner. 

I eat in silence, recreating the 
encounter in my mind. I know 
what he is. But I had known be-
fore we met. I was not repulsed 
It was because there was no

shame. He made no excuses or 
pretenses. He didn't need myap-
proval. And I still was in awe 
of Baldwin, the author, even 
while accepting Baldwin the man. 

He has been asked to say a 
few words about the King assas-
sination. A vacuum because he 
is James Baldwin, and James 
Baldwin is obliged to say some-
thing about Martin Luther King 
at a white party at this mo-
ment. 

He gets up during dinner and 
walks into the library. I follow 
a bit later. He is sitting at the 
desk opposite the beautiful black 
man. He is talking to three white 
guests. 

He has had a lot to drink 
and now his tone varies between 
indifference and contempt. 

"There is no difference be-
tween the tenor of white Amer-
Ica in the South and in San Fran-
cisco." 

The whites can't agree. They 
look like affluent middle-aged 
hippies and are trying hard to 
prove they're not racists. 

"You don't love me,· scorns 
the beautiful black man. A while 
man with long, styled grey hair, 
love beads, a Don Loper turtle-
neCk, and a tailored suit bounds 
toward him. "Oh no?- and he 
places a kiss on the cheek of 
the beautiful black man. 

Everyone laughs except Bald-
win. [ stare at him intently, try-
ing to decide whether he is ugly 
or grotesquely handsome . His 
eyes are huge, and seem to bulge 
out of his head. His nose is 
broad and classically African. 

"It won't do a damn bit of 
good to talk to those white people 
out there," Baldwin says, and 
begins to tell us what he really 
thinks. His words now are dap-

pled with profanity and I think 
of "Another Country," 

"Why be here," I ask. 
"Because I'm alive." 
"But why speak to these peo-

ple? You've admitted it can't 
help." 

"I have to keep trying." 
"Don't youdispair? What keeps 

energizing you?" 
"A force from outside of me. 

I don't know what. But I'm talk-
ing for a lot of people." 

Then the beautUul black man 
walks over to Baldwin and they 
clasp hands. "It's time for you 
to speak," he tells Baldwin. 

"Not yet. I need another min-
ute," he whispers, "I'm just so 
up tight about Martin. Nobody 
knows. Nobody can understand, 
not even you. n 

He gets up and I rise too. 
Baldwin walks towards the door 
but stops in front of me. He 
reaches out his hand and touche s 
the side of my face. But it is 
a paternal gesture, as if silently 
acknowledging my sincerity. 

I follow him into the banquet 
room and he steps to the micro-
phone. 

"Let's be honest." He speaks 
quietly, intensely, making them 
strain to listen. I keep thinking 
about what he had said: "It 
won't do a damn bit of good to 
talk to those white people." 

"We are a kidnapped people,-
he tells them. And then so-
lemnly, "Martin L'lther King is 
dead," 

A buxom, her lily made-up 
starlet leans toward her excort 
and whispers, "I didn't know 
that." 

"Don't feel sorry for • Little 
Black Sambo'," Baldwin closed. 

"Feel sorry for you." 
And I did. 

Symposium on Draft 
To Be Held Next Month 
Conti nucri from "anp. 1 
which has been named the Draft 
College will discuss various as-
pects of the draft. The members , 
of the panel will represent a 
wide variety of opinions on the 
draft. Among them on the panel 
will be Rick Phelps, SDSC draft 
counselor, Les Atkinson, cam-
pus minister; Lowell Torrier, 
representative from the La Jolla 
Friends; Dan Greenburg, a gra-
duate student at UCSD and also 
a representative from the Re -
sistance. 

On June 4 Fred Balderston, UC 
Vice-President of Business and 
Finance will discuss the e ffects 
that the present draft laws and 
regulations will have on higher 
education in the US in general 

and on the University of Calif-
ornia in particular. 

Then, on the 5th, Dan Luevano 
will discuss the social and eco-
nomic effects of the Selective 
Service system; Mr. Luevano is 
the form er Western Regional Di-
rector of the Official Economic 
Opportunities and a member of 
the Presidential Advisory Com-
mittee on the Selective Zervice. 

On June 6, ira M. Jayman, 
Professor of Law at UCB, will 
discuss the law of the draft, 
exactly what it says and what 
the s tudent' s rights and duties 
are at the present time. 

A 11 of the meetings will be 
held in the Revelle Cafeteria at 
7:30 pm, except Jayman's dis-
cussion on the 6th which will 
be held at two o'clock. 

Governor Reagan, in a letter 
sent to the Chairmanofthe Board 
of Regents prior to the cere-
mony, said that the planned r:;.lly 
"would be so indecent it would 
border on the obscene." He asked 
him "to show cause why the COO 
registration as a student organi-
zation should not be revoked, and 
why disciplinary action against 
faculty members who have been 
directly involved should not be 
taken."

So what's a Beach Nut? 
A Beach Nut is a nut, found on 

beaches. 
And a nut, as you know, is a 

person with peculiar beliefs and 
odd habits. 

So if we're asking you to be a 
Beach Nut, we must have good 
reasons. 

We do. 
We have to adm it that it's 

pretty nutty to believe. (among 
other things) that democracy is 
something more than a word; 
that people should control their 
governments rather than be con-
trolled by them; and that the 
highest office in the land should 
be open to the most qualified 
anct capable man, regardless of 
the extent of his personal fortune 
or party popularity. 

You'd have to be pretty nutty 
to believe that. Nutty like Solon 
and Pericles, Rousseau and 
Voltaire, Thomas Jefferson and 
George Washington. 

Nutty like Eugene McCarthy. 
As for odd habits, we have to 

admit that it's pretty nutty to walk 
up to people and ask them to 
vote for a man because he is the 
best candidate. And if that were 
not enough, now we're asking 
you to do it on beaches. 

We must be kidding. 
But we're not. 
If you're nutty enough to know 

that we're not so nutty, and if you 
want to do what you can to influ-
ence the outcome of California 'S 
critical June 4 primary, then we 
want you to help by participating 

',1av 24. 1968 

in Operation Beach Nut during 
this final campaign weekend. 

We want you to join the thou-
sands of other students from 
across the country who have 
helped take Eugene McCarthy 's 
campaign to the voters. We want 
you to join the thousands like 
them who will again take his 
case to the people, in a Califor-
nia style canvassing operation. 

This weekend, Beach Nuts will 
be where the people are at-on 
the beaches. 

Operation Beach Nut will dis-
patch people to every California 
beach beginning on May 30. If 
you want to help with this mas-
sive walking and talking pam-
phleting operation , call one of 

'our area offices and ask for 
further details. In Berkeley our 
number is (415) 548-2790. In Los 
Angeles, call (213) 478-0488. In 
San Diego, (714) 239-3034. Or 
contact your local campus group. 

With you and us and a few 
thousand other nuts, maybe we 
can make this cou ntry sane 
again.

A. S. Sena·te Notes 
by Roger Showley 

Note: Next week, with the installation of a new staff of the Triton 
Times, Dan Waltz will take my place as o[ficial correspondent to 
the Associated students. Waltz was a candidate this quarter for Muir 
College' Senator-at-Large and was active in high school politics. 
He wlll coordinate all publicity and activities of the AS for the Times 
and keep the University community up to date on what the Senate does 
next year. As for myse II, I will be in Hong Kong with the Education 
Abroad Program next year. 

Vice-President Trish Cunningham conducted the Senate Meeting 
yesterday while Tom Shepard was in UCLA, and presided over several 
important decisions by the AS. 

Muir College was finally given $475 for its expenses for the pre-
sent year. This action on Jon Collins' motion marks the first time 
that the Senate has clearly supported college government and it was 
taken ~ithout any dissenting debate. Ken Patric, chairman' of the Muir 
ProviSIOnal Government, has been lobbying since December for these 
funds. 

The Senate also made a striking precedent by approving the post 
of ex-officio senator for a member of the racial minorities. Bill 
Eastman promised to meet with other groups besides the Black Stu-
dents Council to find an interested representative. Next week the 
Senate will review senator's nominations, and presumably one stu-
dent will be accepted. Eastman's purpose is to provide minorities 
a seat on the Senate until a constitutional amendment can be put up 

fo~ stuqent approval which establishes an actual seat on the body for 
mlOorilles. 

The pIay"Glasshouse Shatte", will be presented in the HL Aud-
itorium on May 31, and proceeds from the $1.00 admission will go 
to the organization. The Senate promised to guarentee $100 to Oper-
ation Bootstrap.

Your help is urgently needed. The 
McCarthy campaign depends on 
student volunteers to reach the 
public. Eugene McCarthy has nei-
ther powerful backers nor strong 
party organizatlon--all he has is 
the support of people who believe 
he is a man they can rely on to 
change the direction ofthis coun-
try. U you feel that direction can 
Rnd mllst be changed, please give 
a few hours of your time.

tinues every SaturdRy at 1 p.m.

(459-5003). 

In the President's Report, Trish Cunnigham announced that the 
Senate was proceeding toward cooperation with Dr. Goodkind, the 
faculty member on the Senate, in working toward changes in campus 
curriculum. Already Senator Jon Collins has met with several stu-
dents at a meeting of physics professors to discuss lower division 
Natural Science Sequence at Revelle College . 

Next Week, the Senate will approve a president pro tempore among 
its members, and will probably discuss the judicial board. It wlll be 
the last Senate meeting of the year, barring any emergency seesions. 

Finally, Jim Magill has applied for the position of Publicity Direc-
tor for the AS. Hp has already begun work on a Student Handbook 
for the Fall. Also Gary Curtis has agreed to continue as Activities 
Commissioner. Both Magil's and Curtis' appointments must be rati-
fied by the Senate, an action also scheduled for next week.

Ray Tice and Dr. Frank Halpem battle for the ball at the APO 
Donkey Basketball Game. Students won in sudden death overtime, 
30-28. • 

Donkey Basketball 
Bemmes Pop ular? 

La Jolla Country Day gym 
came alive to the pitter-patter 
of hooved feet last Saturday night 
when Alpha Phi Omega matched 
students againsHaculty in a bene-
fit Donkey Basketball Game for 
the Coffee Hut. 

Before an uncapacity crowd, 
the 9 Donkeyotes (like coyotes) 
--the students--sparkled with 
outfits ranging from pink bloom-
ers and a Vietcong-black turtle 
neck sweater to red tights and a 
World War I flying helmetl Op-
posite them, less uniquely attired 
--but no less determined--were 
the faculty Revellers, sporting 
sundry caps. 

The game led off with a worm 
stomp for the Donkeyotes, and a 
private cheering squad of 12 
children under the direction of 
Dr. Schultz, who hesitantly spell-
ed out "Faculty Power." 

The game ran for a high-kick-
ing 40 minutes with neither team 
leading the other by more than 
4 points. The score was tied 
at 26 all, and the game went into 
a 5-minute overtime. 

Exhaustion ran rampant on both 
Sides, only one basket being tall-
ied by each team. The score tied 

again at 28-all, the players went 
into a "sudden death" playoff. 

The faculty gained control; 
Slippery Schultz blew his big 
moment by missing the basket 
from 5 feet out. Bob Conrad 
scooped the ball from the noor, 
kicked his ass in the right direc-
tion, and tied downcourt. 

The crowd went wild as Con-
rad, trapped by the faculty, pass-
ed to Cass Swinger as he fell 
off his mount. Cass won the game 
for the students with an unopposed 
shot from 3 feet out. 

Half-time entertainment fea-
tured a gift from Susan Smith of 
a lemon-whipped cream pie to 
Tom Shepard's surprised face 
who passed it on to Tom Hull 
for approval. 

High scorer for the faculty 
was Tom Hull; for students, Cass 
Swinger. Dean Bob Topolovac 
received the "Most Endurance" 
award for continually trying to 
force his donke y to stand still 
long enough for him to mount. It 
should be stated that the honor 
code prevailed almost throughout 
the entirety of the game.

The subject matter then turned 

to a discussion of an incident that 
had occurred that morning in Dr. 
Saltman's Biology class. It seems 
that the Provost had told his 
class that he considered himseH 
somewhat unqualified to instruct 
students on racial problems, and 
that this should be a personal 
matter with each individual.

Spikers Prepare for Final Meet 

Lowell Bergman, a grad stu-
dent, had objected to this state-
ment, saying that the intended 
purpose of the AS was to promote 
a discussion, and that students 
should be given the right to 
participate in such a discussion 
if they so desired. After a few 
students staged a walk-out, Salt-
man proceeded to lecture on 
genetiCS, inviting Bergman to 
stay and learn something atlout 
"the realities of life." 

That afternoon the Provost 
came to the free speecil area to 
tion to go about with "business 
as usual." 

While speaking of the present 
strife within the University, Hitch 
observed that the academic in-
stitution is by no means blame-
less. In particular. he added 
that the University has stressed 
the solution of scientific prob-
lems only, with little consider-
ation paid to social inequities. 

According to reports, the UCSD 
thinclads are in for a lot of 
competition as they. finish out 
their season with the All-Cal 
Meet at Santa Barbara tomorrow 
afternoon. The way it looks now, 
the Gaucho team is going to be 
hard to beat as they are fresh 
from their routing of the NCAA 
Pacific Coast Regional Meet at 

UC Davis last weekend. 
Since this meet is so close to 

finals the Triton squad wlll not 
be at full strength as several 
men are in a great panic over 
their grades to be. At the present 
time the list of athletes travelling 
for this meet numbers twelve, 
not even as many men as there 
are events (18). 

Jay Segal who will be running 
the three mile against men from 
Riverside and Davis, will have 
to contend with Jeff Rawlings 
and his clocking of 14:35.6. One 
quarter mllers Marc Rothman 
aM Tom Gatlin will have their 
hands full as they come up against 
Jay Elbel, 47.3, and an old high 
school rival of Rothman's, Dennis 
Chinlaeff at 48.2. The mile relay 
team wUl be matched against a 
foursome that just lowered the 
NCAA Regional mark to 3:12.6, 
which is a half second slower 
than their school record. 

'!be field events men will have 
their problems too wUh Gaucho's 
such as Clark Chelsey (Dlseus-

166ft, shot 55ft. 9in), Joe Can-
trell (6ft. 8in. high jump), Bob 
Engelstad and Jerry Downer in 
the Javelin (230ft. and 226ft. res-
pec.) and Jerry Wygant in the 
triple jump at 47ft. 8in. Coach 
Richard Johnson, who will most 
likely be unable to attend the 
meet pending the birlli of his 
expected chUd, hopes that these 
outstanding performances will 
help push rather than hinder our 
athletes. 

The following are the Triton 
squad going to All-Call; 

T. Wolle (100,220, 440 relay, 
long and triple jumps) 

J. McCarthy (100,220, 440 relay) 
S. Gadolo (sbot, jav., 440 relay, 

discus, 100yd) 
M. Rothman (440, 440 relay, 

mile relay) 
T. Gatlin (440 IH, mile relay, 

440) 
W. Kumley (mile, 880, mile relay) 
P. Naumann (880, mile relay) 
J. Nash (880) 
J. Segal (three mile) 
R. Dimon ( shot, jav., discus) 
J. Dent (pole vault) 
B. Burdick (pole vault) 

Football Is News 
The Triton football squad winds 

up its spring training next Tues-
day completing about three weeks 
of intensive wdrkouts. The team 
suited up in full pads last Tues-
day and have been breaking them 
in for most of the week. These 
grldders are represented by a 
wide variety of athe lets, some 
who have never played organ-
ized tackle football before! 

Coach Walt Hackett has been 
concentratlng on defense which 
he fee ls is the secret for a 
&OOd team. Joing Hackett on the 
Milenbaugh,Christopher, and Bud 

Whitehead, defensive back for the 
San Diego Chargers. 

Speaking of football, another 
closely related group have also 
been getting ready for the fall 
sports season --- the Triton 
cheerleaders. Tiley recently sub-
mitted a budget for outfits to the 
A.S. In true spirit of UCSD, 
they have by no means remained 
conservative in the designing of 
their cheerlead!ng outfits. 

Rumor has it they'll be wear-
ing suede miniskirts with match-
ing vests, beads, and be equipped 
with tamborlnes and flower pom-
poms. 

Saltman replied that he agreed 
that the University should be in-
volved in seeking answers to the 
racial crisis, but felt that perhaps 
the Humanities classes would be 
more appropriate for discussion. 
He said that he is initiating 
Sociology classes next year that 
will deal with the problem. 

In conclusion, the Oxford gra-
duate proposed that students 
more firmly support the aca-
demic community as a means of 
solving social problems and 
stressed a combining of the re-
sources of state-wide public in-
stitutions to participate in the 
solution of the Univer sity's and 
communities' problems.

Further, C FS could alford to 

hide a professional lobbyist in 
Sacramento who would push for 
such students concerns as 
changes in the voting age and 
miUtary service. 

To fund the organization in the 
beginning stages, the UC repre-
sentatives have considered build-
ing two apartment buildings at 
UCLA and Berkeley lor students. 
From the memberships which are 
sold on the campuses, further 
services would be possible. 

"Given that it wUI take sever-
al years to achieve a political 
status which many students will 
wish to identify with on a large 
scale," Caballo says, "the eco-
nomic benefits provided by the 
card take on high importance in 
th short run. The sale of the 

card on a wide scale will raise 
the revenue needed for an ef-
fective organization." 

See the accompanying article 
for a description of how CFS 
would be organized. 

" Th':! basic argument used to 
convin~e merchants," Caballo 
says, • is that they will receive 
a hirh.!r portion of student busi-
ness iI \ return for the discount 
offered and the publicity pro-
vided by the student card."
