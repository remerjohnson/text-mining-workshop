tudents will vote on whether 
to make A.S. commiSSIOner offices 
appointed rather than elected 
positions in a referendum added 
to the April general election ballot 
by the A. . Council on March 5. 

The referendum will ask stu-
dents if they support amending 
the A. . constitution to grant the 
A .. Council the task of appotnt-
ing commissioners of student 
advocacy, programming, academic 
affairs, student services, diversity 
affairs, athletics and enterprises. 

An appointments committee 
composed of the newly elected 
A.S. president, the outgoing com-
missioner of a given office and one 
newly elected senator from each 
college would recommend 
appointments. Approval of each 
appointment would then be "sub-
ject to a majority vote" by the A.S . 
Council.

A panel of three professors

March 7 about the possible eco-
nomic, political and military 
consequences a war with Iraq 
could bring to the Middle Ea t, 
Iraq and the United States. 

" we stand on the eve of 
war with Iraq, many questions 
and issues remain unanswered," 
said David Lake, chairman of 
UCSD's politica l science depart-
ment and the fo rum's mediator. 
" ur focus today is on the con-

equences of war for the regIOn, 
iraq and for the Uillted States." 

KIren Chaudhry, a political 
science profes or from UC

Middle East, North Afnca and 
South ASia. Chaudhry was the

regional consequences for a

"I believe that anti-American

aid, taJking about the changing 

views in the Arab world . 
Chaudhry then went on to focus 
on Iraq, giving her opinions on 
the outcome of a war there.

UCSD biologists block 
inflammation in mice 

UCSD biOlogiSts have discovered that 
eliminating the ability of white blood cells to 
respond 0 low oxygen levels effectively 
blocks the development of Inflammation In 
mice, an advance that could have Wide-
spread Implications for the prevention of 
Inflammation tn humans. 

The researchers produced three different 
strains of mice, each of which had been 
genetically modified WI hout a ey factor In 
a biochemical pa hway known to regula e 
the ability of the cells to adapt to low oxygen 
enVlfonments. Testing the responses of the 
three differen strains, he SCientists diSCOV-
ered tha Inactlva~on of a protein known as 
hYPOXia indUCible ranscnptlon factor-1 
strongly blocked the Inflammatory response 
In mice. 

The discovery could lead to he develop-
ment of a new class of drugs for treanng he 
deblli a~ng and painful lOin Inflammation In 
the 43 million Amencans who suffer from 
arthnbs I also may help doctors treat cancer 
more e ectlvely, because umor develop-
ment IS assOCIaled With a pronounced Inflam-
matory response In he vas maJonty of cases. 

The results of he s udy are detailed In

MONDAY, MARCH 10,2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Ballot: Ten senators propose appointment 
conlinued [mm /)(II(C I 

Jeff I.e, Warren College cnior 
Senator Lauren Lee, Revelle 
Sophomore Senator Achlm Lyon 
and Revelle Junior Senator Bishoy 
Said, argued that the amendment 
would best serve all students. 

Supporters of the proposal con-
tended that an appointment \),stCIll 
for commissioners would he in hne 
with the representative sy~tem of 
delllocr.ley employed by the U.S. 
government and would make the 
commissioner pOSts less exclusion-
ary by taking slate politics out of 
the equation. upporters also 
argued that due to student voting 
apathy, the councd might be more 
qu.dified to select individuals who 
possess the qualifications that spe-
Cific commi~siuner pusts dcmand. 

"\Ve fclt that qualified comnus-
Sioners could be picked bencr by the 
A. . Council," Lyon s3ld. "It would 
serve the students bener if cOlllmis-
sioners were more qualificd." 

Other members of the A.S. 
Council, including A.S . President 
J cnn Brown and five of the six COIll-

mi~sioncrs present at the meeting, 
opposed the proposed amendment, 
arguing that It would limit the voice 
of students, eliminate the educa-
tional value of running for office 
and could lead to cronyism. 

" We fe lt that qualified 
commissioners could be 

picked better by the A.S. 
Council. II 

- Achim Lyon, Revelle 
sophomore senator 

"It doesn't make a difference 
who's the most qualified candidate. 
[The po itions should be filled bYI 
the candidate whose goals arc most 
in line with the students," aid 

ommlssioncr of Programming 
Gabe rossman. "Commissioner 
positions should be elected, and 
that shouldn't change, ever." 

Amid the item's diSC USSIOn, 
Muir Sophomore enator Jeremy 

ogan suggested that the A.S. 
Council consult students before 
passing the legislation. 

"Regardless of the advantages 
or disadvantages of appointing 
commissioners. the people who 
traditionally elect [commissionersl 
should have a say in talong that 
right away or maintaining it," 
Cogan said. 

Marshall Junior Senator I.e 
later submi tted an Item of immedi-
ate consideration that proposed 
adding a referendum asking stu-
dents if they support the amend-
ment to the general election ballot. 
Council members disclls ed 
whether to word the referendum 
question to highlight its specific 
purpose, but settled on simply ask-
ing srudents, "Do you support the 
follOWing ASUCSD constitutional 
changes?" and displaying the pro-
posed amendments. 

The A..S. Council approved the 
referendum question by a vote of 
17- 1, with one abstention. 

Warren: Council stops outside funding 
conLlmred from pa~e I 

scholarships and leadership ban-
quets, for which money had been 
previously allocated. 

"It's really unfortunate, because 
there's a lot of th.ings we wanted to

According to Bowen, no organi-

the council for fund because they 
know that there are no funds for 
them to ask for. Student orgalllza-

The total balance of the WC C 

accounts was $13,967 as of the 
March 6 meeting. Out of this 
money, the WCSC has set aside 
about $12,000 for Warren college'S 
upcoming semiformal and $2,000 
for leadership scholarships awarded

Megan's Law, enacted In

California law allows adults and 
organi7.ations to learn the names and

Critics of Megan's Law charge 
that making registry inforlnation 
public is tantamount to branding 

In the end, harassment or violent 
acts against known or suspected sex 
offenders are illegal, and communi -
ty members viewing ex offender 
maps or registry entries are instruct-
ed not to use this knowledge for ille-
gal purpo es. While ocial 0 tracism 
is a small possibility, thaI is not the

to warrant the label of unconstitu-

Generation 'Y' full of firsts Anti-Semitism again 
plagues the Continent Unique events have filled our lives 

By EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

The hottest issue today would 
have to be, hands down, the 
inevita ble conflict in I raq our 
country is about to enter. At this 
point in time, the daily deluge of 
print, television and radio news 
trumpeting the newest Bush 
blunder or U.N. dissidence is 
becoming all 100 fami liar. 

addam this, unilateral that, 
inspections this, Blair that - it 
would not be 3 stretch to say that 
the ci tizens of thi s country are 
reasonably overexposed to the 
Iraqi predicament. 

As commonplace as it may 
seem, however, our country is fac-
ing a SI[u3tion that is in fact very 
unique. The magnitude of oppo i-
lion voiced by nations and activists 
alike is almost unprecedented, 
especially when the worldwide 
February peace rally is taken into 
account. The United Statcs, after 
months of diplomauc wrangling, 
stands relatively alone on the cusp 
of aggression. Tlus unique sinra-
tion is just one of sevc ral that 
stand to shape the so-called gen-
eration "Y." Our genera lion rn tlus 
country, loosely defined as those 
born after the mid- to late '70s, 
has experienced extraordinary, 
wide-reaching events that have 
never been encountered before, 
that have and Will dctt!rrnll1e the 
potential and prospect of our hfe-
times. 

Granted, every generation in 
the 20th century has been 
touched, scarred and transformed 
by monumental events. The baby 
boomers had the Vietnam \Var 

COMMENTARY 
and the Kennedy assassination, 
and their parents had the most 
devastating conflict the planet has 
ever cen: World War II. Each of 
these cvents had untold effects on 
all who experienced them, and it is 
quite likely that anyone who lived 
through such landmark times can 
remember exact moments that 
marked the climax of each. 
Ilowcvcr, loolong at the current 
youth and young adults emerging 
Out of lhe 20th century, this gen-
eralion has lived lhrough epic 
events that point to an exceptional 
hi tory. 

Barring the gradual but 
undoubtedly life-changing advent 
of the computer and Internet 
technological revolution, there 
have been pecific, sudden cvents 
that can be said to stand out In the 
conscil)Usness of this generation. 
For example, one obvious event 
would be Sept. II, the mother of 

all mind-shattering extremities. It 
has been said many ti mes before 
that no terrorist attack, dome tic 
or international, has ever 
occurred on American soil with 
this kind of enormous effect. 
When the planes crashed into 
buildings, they al 0 crashed into 
any sense of security or normalcy 
in citizens' minds. It affected 
almost every facet of the lives of 
those in this country. 

I t also brought an onslaught of

skies have been emptied of com-
mercial (llrcrafl; and the first lIIne 
eel taln ~pcctacles, sport and enter-
tainment ha\'e been po tponed for 
so long for a nation's collective 
mourning. A million words have 
been typed and gallons of ink have 
been pilled to analyze the person-
al, polrtical and economic fallout 
of the attack . All within the 
United States could nOt brush past 
its tragic legacy. Indelrbly, it left a 
massive impression on all ages, but 
It IS thiS generation that will have 
it imprinted on the beginning acts 
of their lives. 

V\'hrle not nearly as life-alter-
ing as that horrrfic day, thi gener-
ation has also seen an unheard of 
polmcal event; the 2000 electIOn 
between AI Gore and George W. 
Bush was marked by a month of 
chad-hanging and ultra-partisan 
craziness. Even broadcast anchors 
were confused by the election

were to endanger them phYSically,

have come from both extremcs of

Pint: Anti .. Zionists equate Israel with Nazi Germany 
conunued from page 5 

JeWish community, there are grear 
rhreats from the left wing as well , 
which has decidedly 3ml almost 
unanllllously backed ano-ZlOnI ts. 
T here I virnl ally no cilverSitY of 
opllllon regarding I rael, which IS 
often equated with NazI Germany. 
Even more alarming, where many 
America n pro- Pales tini an Wish 
for a peaceful resolution and some 
degree of cohabitation, many 
more European pro-Palestini ans 
pubbcly entertain the thought of 
elim1l1ating Israel altogether 

T hiS leads ro heated debates 
about the Similarities and differ-
ences between anti-Zionism and 
anti- emitism. In theory and ide-
all y, anti-Ziol1lsm solely consti-
tutes the rejection of Israeli 
nationabsm, bur does not con-
demn Jews across the world or 
Israelis that support Palestil1lan 
freedom. As any intelligent ano-
ZlOl1ISt will tell you, they have 
only re pect for J eli's around the 
world, but are opposed to Sharon's 
admirustration and the apparent 
oppression of the Palesoman peo-
ple. While thiS i a valid ideal, the 
world does nOl work 111 such fan CI-
ful way . 

Because ano ·Ziorusm deals With 
oppo ioon to a government that is 
nearly all one race, it is extremely 

R RUSSELL ATHLETIC 1902 
FOR THE L O N G R U N , 

easy to slip over the line into racist 
anti - emitism. Anti-Zionism pro-
vides a very solid hiding place for 
anti - emite to voice their opinions 
under a credible name. [n fact, anti-
Semites can even discriminate 
against Jews publicly and then 
Immediately assume a context of 
"Israeli Jews only. " 

In some cases, this left-wing 
defense of the oppressed is much 
scarier than the blatant racism of 
the right wing. Because so many 
left-wing acovists are immersed in 
the righteousness of their cause 
and the emotion that allows that 
narrow View, m~ny protests 
against Israel have re lilted in 
physical assaults on JeWish 
passersby, not the least in Paris, 
Hamburg and London. In a more 
diabolic avenue, prote t against 
Israel can lead to subtle discrimi-
nation . At the Manchester 
Instirute of Technology in the 
United Kingdom , professor Mona 
Baker recently admitted to firing 
two of her own journal's contribu-
tOrs upon hearing that they had 
taken the Jewish right of rerurn 
and accepted Israeli citizenship. If 
mere acceptance of Israeli citizen-
ship (which is extended to all Jews) 
endangers Jews, then anti-
Zionism has cro sed the line mto 
anti-Semitism. In European left-

ism, this has become increasingly 
normal. 

However, it is not only anti-
Zionism that has the left wing 
attacking the Jews. Anti-
Americanism has fueled much of 
the fire of racism. Because the 
United Statc;s i the la t major sup-
porter of Israel, hatred of 
American policies always becomes 
a link to the Palestinian suffering 
brought upon by the Jews. Because 
Americans tolerate Israeli action, 
many leftists assume that the Jews 
must have the Americans in their 
control. Conversely, the hatred of 
America immediately brings forth 
hatred of Israel by association. 
Increased tension over the Iraq cri-
sis, which is always associated with 
the oppression of Palestine, anti-
American sentiment drifts over to 
anti-Zionism. With such virulent 
attacks on American policy in 
Europe, it is no surprise that this 
emotion becomes racist at times. 

Thus, because of rising political 
validation of right-wing extremists, 
toleration of anti-Semites under 
the guise of anti-Zionism and the 
hatred of Jews by association with 
American support, Jews in Europe 
find thernselve in a very turbulent 
and tense situation. Open criticism 
has led to fierce rebuttals. French 
Pre Ident Jacque Chirac recently 

UCSD Bookstore 

snapped at a Jewish journalist who 
was critical of the government's 
handl ing of anti-Semitic attacks. 
"Stop saying that there is anti-
Semiti m in France. There is no 
anti-Semitism in France, and ... no 
anti-Semites in France," Chirac 
said. Furthermore, he told the 
reporter that if he did not stop, "it 
,,~1I be bad for the Jews." In such 
an atmosphere, it is very difficult 
for Jews in Europe to voice their 
opinions or take a stand against the 
rising racism. 

Looking at the relatively mild 
hatred that Americans receive, it 
becomes very difficult to pity our-
selves. Americans still face a vast 
majority of friendly, intelligent 
Europeans who respect views that 
they do not agree with. European 
relationships with the United Sates 
will dictate that European politi-
cians protect Americans against 
extremists. However, with increas-
ing political tolerance for anti-
Semitism, it becomes easier to 
sympathize with European Jews, 
who now have to face the undeni-
able revival of the mistake that 
Europe cannot seem to learn from.

funding. 

"The dean's office has offered 
to assist us in funding ," said 
Treasurer Chris Lee . "We've been 
looking into the income account 
as well." 

The income account, which is 
made up of WCSC revenue gener-
ateri over past years, was the source 
for the $12,000 semiformal alloca-
tion. 

"We usually do not deal directly 
wi th the income account," Lee 
said. "But we felt that it was appro-
priate. " 

According to Lee, the council is 
currently in the process of figuring 
out the procedure for accessing 
this income account for additional 
funding. 

According to past budgets, 
which did not feature the $12,000 
income account allocation, the 
WCSC's balance was down to 

,906 in ovember 2002 . 
Part of the reasons leading to

Lee, was the arrival of unexpected

Kaunda speaks of AIDS epidemic 
Former Zambian president stresses prevention of virus spread 

By MEAGHAN FIELD 
Contributing Writer 

Former Zambian President 
Kenneth Kaunda spoke on the 
growing AIDS crisis in Africa on 
March 7. HIS lecrure, titled 
"I IIV/AIDS in Africa," addressed 
the present crisis and the actions 
necessary to control the disease. 

Kaunda served as founding pres-
ident of the Republic of Zambia 
from 1964 until 1991. During this 
time, he became the first head of 
state in Africa to acknowledge the 
growing scale and destructiveness 
of the AIDS virus. Since 1991, he 
has focused his efforts on the crisis, 
establi hing the Kaunda Children 
of Africa Foundation in 2002 . The 
foundation includes ervices for 
education and treatment. 

According to statistics of AID 
infection in Africa given by the 
Rotary AIDS Project, the number 
of infected persons is estimated at 
30 million, \vith 3 million of those 
infected under the age of 15. Tho e 
infected in Africa represent 71 per-
cent of the known infected persons 
in the world. Kaunda also reported 
that the prevalence of the di ease in 

Zambia is at 16 percent, although 
he acknowledged that the actual 
numbers might be much greater 
because a full census of the people 
has never been donc. He said that 
there is an urgent need for more 
accurate figures to know the full 
impact of the disease and plan for 
treaonent and prevencon. 

Though Kaunda's lecture 
focllsed mainly on those infected, 
they are not his only concern. There 
are more than 12 .1 Il1lllion African 
children orphaned by the disease, a 
fact Kaunda knows all too well . His 
own son died from AID , leaving 
behind a ,vife and six children. 

"AIDS has the potential to cre-
ate the world's first holocaust of 
human beings," Kaunda said. 

Kaunda discussed many of the 
factors of the spread of AIDS in 
Africa, saying that to deal with the 
impact of the disease, it is first 
necessary to deal with these fac-
tors. One of the mo t prevalent of 
these was the economic sute of 
the countries in Africa. He offered 
this as the reason for inadequate 
education and treatment fac ilities. 
Kanuda also suggested that 
greater aid was necessary not only 

from thc African governments, 
but also from the private sectors 
because it is with the increase of 
funding that changes can be made. 
Kaunda said that funding from any 
source would never be refused . 
President George W. Bush 
addressed the AIDS epidemic in 
his 2003 tate of the Union when 
he announced a $15 billion 31l0ca-
oon to AIDS relief in Africa. 

"We are all our brothers' and 
sisters' keepers," Kaunda aid. "Our 
home as our community is IlI1ked to 
the healing of those around us." 

According to Kaunda , the 
most important tep in the con-
trol of the disease is to further 
efforts of preventive education . 
He targeted this as the critical fac-
tor in slowing down the infection 
rate. Kaunda cited abstinence , 
condom use and HlV testing as 
the necessary focuses of this edu-
cation. He said that though there 
have been efforts by Western 
groups to educate, these groups 
often do not tailor their programs 
for the environment and people of 
Africa, and so often these pro-
grams can be counter-productive. 
Kaunda sa id that the education 

programs must consider specific 
cultural factors in their creation in 
order to be fully effective . 

Equally important to education 
efforts, Kaunda said, is the treat-
ment of those currently infected by 
AIDS. According to the 2003 State 
of the Union Address, anti-retroVl -
ral drugs currently cost around 
$300 a year. This is out of reach fo r 
almost all those infected 111 Africa. 
Kaunda said that not only is there a 
need to make current treatment 
options more available, trea tments 
need not be limited to Western 
protocols , and more work ~hould be 
done using ava ilable re ources on 
the African cononent. 

Accordi ng to Kaunda, the 
future of Africa is dependent on 
the control of the A1D vi rus. 

He said that great efforts are 
currently being made to counter 
the stigma of the disease. 

"We have overcome many 
great travails as blacks and whites 
working together," Kaunda said . 
"We have overcome slavery, the 
middle passage, colonizaoon, seg-
regation, apartheid and, With the 
help of God, we ca n overcome 
AIDS."

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Plan explores college access 
Preuss School hosts Senate Committee

the llJ"crslty of Cahforma. 

The plan, more specifically 
called the ,\1aster Plan for 
Educanon Dlspanne III Acce to 
Resources, I aimed al studentS 
that come from a specific socioe-
conomic class and raCial ethnicity, 
notably Latino and black high 
chool graduates. Accordmg to a 

handout from the assembly, only 4 
percent of Latino and 3 percent of 
black high chool graduates are 
ebgible to attend or even apply for 
the University of Cabforma. 

The jomt comminee, among 
other advocates of the plan, inSist-
ed that the problem stood upon 
the lack III avallablbty of college

"StudentS who are Latino or 
black don't have the oppormnity," 
said tare en. Dede Alpert of the 
JOllll 1asrer Plan Comminee. 
"Doors are closed Ito) them."

"There must be a default tan-
dard for all learners," Lundquist 
said. "The and simply run Out 
of the hourglass. The students 
are pedahng, but they can't catch 
up." 

However, noting a different 
aspect of the SlUla non of under-
pnvlleged hIgh chool graduates, 
State Sen. Richard Alarcon said 
that lhe UC requir~ments for 
apphcauon are the problem. 

"The UC system needs to focus 
more upon translating what those 
requirementS are," Alarcon said. 

Information on the handout 
explallls that the A-G college 
preparatory classes, which consist 
of specific English, foreign lan-
guage and math courses, exclude 
many vocational or career-orient-
ed courses. 

The speakers also worked ro 
explain that students who prepare 
themselve in vocational cour es 
are preparing for the worKplace, 
but not for college. Part of the 
Master Plan is to implement more 
"academic rigor" into these cour -
es in order ro engrain the knowl-
edge for college preparatory stu-
dents. 

"Academic mastery is the only 
foundation upon which authentic 
choices can be made about life 
choices," said Lundquist. 

Alarcon also raised the ques-
tion that perhaps the students lack 
the rigor of motivation to contin-
ue on to a college education. 
However, one student aid that 
most kids, at least the one attend-
mg Preuss, have the drive. 

"We feel more privileged 
because a lot of nldentS are not 
getting it the same as us," aid 
ninth-grade Preuss student 
Christopher Khavarian . "Most 
students like being here. 
Wherever you go, there is that 
small bunch. Though it may be 
hard on them, they know that in 
the future it will payoff."

Fortune: Game show stops at 
UCSD during 'College Week'

was a lot of fun .» 

The studentS vying for a spot on 
the how were as diverse as UCSD 
getS - freshmen to seniors, com-
munications majors to bioengi-
neers - all came to test their luck 
at the mobile game board. 

Sarah Vanderhal wa randomly 
selected to audition for a slot on 
the how. This freshman math and 
music double-major is :lctually the 
product of the show. 

Her mother won a trip to 
Europe on the show many years 
ago. VVhile touring the continent, 
she met a Dutchman who was later 
to become her husband. Sarah i 
the first of their two kids. he was 
understandably thrilled by the 
opportunity to complete the cycle 
on "Wheel of Fortune." 

It is thiS natural enthusiasm 
that producers are looking for in 
addition to the ability to solve 
puzzles. 

"We're looking for people who 
know how to play the game," said 

Harry Friedman, executive produc-
erof"Wheel of Fortune." Friedman 
promised that 15 students would be 
selected from area colleges, but San 
Diego is apparently a preferred 
locale for taping "Wheel of 
Fortune." 

"\-\le love an Diego," 
Friedman said. "It really repre-
sents what people think of about 
California, and we get consistent 
results frolll San Diego [contes-
tant] searches." 

UCSD is even favored among 
local colleges. According to 
Rosenberg, the lower number of 
applicants at UCSD as opposed to 
SDSU is more than offset by the 
quality of the candidates. 

"yVe may see less people here, 
but they're better candIdates," 
Rosenberg said . 

Episodes filmed with contes-
tants found in these searches 
hould begin airing at the end of 

the month under the themes "San 
Diego Week,"" ollege Week" and 
"Armed Forces Week."

Children's television friend leaves profound mark 
Students reflect on the ways Mister Rogers' positive attitude touched their lives 

By NOREEN THAM 
Contributing Writer 

The late Fred Rogers may have 
left his neighborhood, but he lives 
on in the hearts of tho e who grew 
up wanting to be his neIghbor. 

Mr. Rogers, as he i known to 
his televisinn audIence, was the 
host of the longest running chil-
dren' show on PBS, "Mister 
Rogers' Neighborhood;" and he 
died of stomach cancer at the age of 
74 on Feb. 2 . His death left many 
saddened by [he loss of a man who, 
for some, was a datly part of theIr 
childhood. 

"I remember wat hing ,\1r. 
Roger almo t everyday. I t I ad to 
10 e hlln because It'S Itke loslOg 
omeone who was a part of my life 

as a chtld. You almost thlOk of him 
Itke someone who would always be 
around ," saId Revell e Cnllege 
freshman onny Huynh. 

Fe" who watched Iu program 
were unaffected by hIS death, for 
Rogers' name was synonymou 
with all the good charactenstics a 
person could possess. 

"It was \'ery sad when I heard 
that he had pas ed away. I Ie was 
someone that all the kids knew and 
loved. He was around before any of 
those shows Itke 'Barney' came on 
the air. 1 thmk he was a great asset 
to chIldren 's televiSIon programs, 
and he WIll truly be mIssed by all 
the generations that were able to 
enJoy hIS 'V,'on't you be my neigh-
bor" smtle," said John MUIr 
College freshman I{jmberly Mldon 
Sluntaku. 

"Mister Rogers' NeIghborhood" 
not only prOVIded emcrtalOment to 
chIldren, but also affected the way 

they lived their lives. "I think as a 
child, Mr. Rogers taught me to treat 
others kindly. You just wanted to be 
a better person after watching his 
show. Even though we did not know 
it at the time, I think his show was a 
primary source of good morals," said 
Muir college junior Marsha Wong. 

Along with teaching young chil-
dren good manners and enthu ias-
tically promoting positive values, 
Rogers also helped children con-
front important and sometimes 
scary subjects, such as divorce, 
death and VIolence . 

" If we can share our elves 
with our kids in ways that 
aren't frightening w them , 
that's the greatest gift we 
can give anyone: the gift 

of an honest self. /I 
- Fred Rogers 

"The general mes age of the 
neighborhood I that the truth IS 
best," saId Rogers 10 an interview 
WIth the global information com-
pany Reuters around the ome of 
the last ainng of hIS show in 2001. 

Rogers carned a strong beltef 
that tele\1slon should be an aid to 
the well -betng of the human spIrit. 
"If we can share ourselves with our 
lads In ways that aren 't fnghtenJng 
ro them, that's the greatest gift we 
can gIve anyone ' the gift of an hon-

est self," said Rogers in his inter-
view. 

Born in Latrobe, Penn., Rogers 
studied early child development at 
the University of Pittsburgh and 
received a charge to continue his 
work with families and children 
through television when he was 
ordained as a minister. 

When viewers reminisce upon 
"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," 
they maintain that certain aspects 
of it will never be forgotten. 

"In his show, I'll always remem-
ber [he puppets and the train that 
always rode in with a certain char-
acter. And I liked Mr. Rogers 
because he always seemed so nice 
and caring," said Earl Warren 
College sophomore Ryan Lustig. 

Among image of "Mister 
Rogers ' Neighborhood," one of 
the most notable is the perfor-
mance of his trademark rourine at 
the beginning of each show while 
singing his theme song, "It's a 
Beautiful Day in the 
I cighborhood." 

"I will probably remember him 
for tossing his shoe, catching it, 
then purting it on his left foot. Oh, 
and who can forget the thing he did 
with the zipper on his jacket?" aid 
Lustig. 

Some can also recall favorite 
episode of the show years after 
seetng them. 

"My favorite Mr. Rogers 
episode was definitely the one 
where he visited the Crayola cray-
on factory. T remember betng 
amazed by all the colors!" said 
MUIr seruor Adam Klekowsla . 

\Vhile most other shows of that 
genera tion were filled with car-
roans and other unreal characters, 

Rogers' show proved unique due to 
his attempt to teach and interact 
with children. 

"'Mister. Rogers' eighborhood' 
was different for me because it was-
n't a cartoon - he a tually talked to 
you. He wanted us to be his neigh-
bor. You also learned cool stuff, like 
about the jelly bean factory," said 
Eleanor Roosevelt College fre hman 
Bryan Wilson. 

Rogers' work as a ho t and what 
he called a "television friend" did 
not go unnoticed. I Ie recei\'ed two 
Peabody Awards, four Emmys, a 
"Lifetime Achievement" award 
from the arional Academy of 
TeleVIsion Arts and ciences and 
the nation's lughest CIvilian honor: 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 

Along with providing life 
lessons, Rogers also touched some 
viewers in a spirinlal way. 

Jim Judkil/CoUlfesy of Miste, Rogers.org 

"One thing that I noticed about 
Mr. Roger was that he was 
extremely welcomtng, caring and 
friendly. I knew that there had to be 
something that caused him to love 
everyone and everything relentless-
ly, bUI I didn't lalOw wha t it was. 
Later in life, I found out hIS 3\\ e-
some loving ani rude was a ("reet 
result of his belief tn Jesus ChflSt 
and His commandment to ' Lore 
your neighbor as your~elf,'" saId 
Roosevelt sophomore lanl,h 
Amin. 

Unlike many chIldren s telc\'i-
sion shows today, whIch pro\,ue 
temporary amu ement, students 
claim that "Mistcr Rogers' 

elghborhood" left chIldren IVllh 
so much more.

Mr. Rogers: Childhood 
icon's death saddens students 

continued from page t 1I 
values which could actually help 
their character development while 
entertaining them; many other 
shows solely exist for entertain-
ment and may inadvertently actual-
ly hurt kids' character develop-
ment," said Revelle College junior 
Michelle Scarberry. 

Though many mourn his death, 
some are consoled by the hope that 
he is now in a place void of pain 
and suffering. 

"I'm sad about his passing away, 
but I know he is having a grand 
time - trus time in God's neigh-
borhood," said Amin. 

Rogers is survived by his wife, 
Joanne, their two sons and twO 
grandsons. Though his show 
stopped airing in 2001, repeat 
episodes have been playing on 
PBS. 

Though he has passed, Rogers 
will forever be immortalized in the 
hearts of children and those who 

grew up watching the man dressed 
in a cardigan and sneakers. Posted 
by the announcement of his death 
on his production Web site 
remains the message, "Children 
have always known Mr. Rogers as 
their 'television friend,' and that 
relationship doesn't change with 
his death."

Men's track takes first in meet 
Women take second place at City Championships 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

TheUCSD men's and womcns 
track teams appeared in mid-season 
form at the March San Diego City 

hampionships, giving a strong fol -
low-up to its medIOcre performance 
the prior weekend at the All-Cal 
Challenge Cup on March I. 

The men's track and fie ld team 
finished first, and the Triton 
women finished second at UC D's 
Triton Track & Field tadium on 
March 8. 

"I t was a good meet. I was very 
pleased with all of the perfor-
mances," said UC D head coach 
Tony Salerno. 

Individual highlights for the 
men included freshman sprinting 
and jumping winners Brad Libuit, 
Peiman Lah ael and Matt Horner. 

Libuit had three fir t-place fin -
ishes in the hIgh jump, the triple 
jump and the javelin. Lahsaei had 
wins in the 200-meter race with a 
time of 22.32 and in the 100 relay 
with Horner, who also dominated 
the 400-meter race by gliding to 
VIctOry with a time of 49.69. 

A victory of particular Signifi-
cance for the women was the one-
two finish in the women's 3,000 by 
Tritons Kathy Reed and Michele 
DiMeo, which underlines the 
strength of the UCSD distance 
squad. 

Sara Alsup was also an impor-
tant contributor to the Triton ce-
ond-place finish, which aw her 
long throw of 151-7 in the di cus 
translate to a 'arional Collegiate 
Athletic As oclation Championship 
Provisional Qualifying perfor-
mance. AI up also had the ixth-
be t hammer throw in school histo-
ry with a 143- heave. 

The order of fimshes on the 
women's Side was ; 0 U (2 17.5), 
UC D (206.5), Pomt Loma 

azarenc (109), an Marcos 
nO), USD (6) and A1hant 
I nternauonal (I). . 

On the other Side, PI.. 
(171.-), San Mar as (119.5) and 
\l L' (3 ) followed UCSD (N I) 111 
the men's compeutlon. 

"The athletes really ~tepped a 
up across the board, even or eight 
people made ignlficant Improve-
ment, and ome lathletes] were not 
challenged [by the competi tion 
offered]," Salerno said. 

At the preVlOUS weekend s A11-
Cal Challenge up 011 March I at 

Jake Mumm/Guordian 
Younclelders: The men's trac~ led by freshmen Brad LlbUl~ Pelman Lahsael 
and Matt Horner, finished In first place at the CIty Championships on March 8 

UC Riverside, UCSD recorded 
marks that fell short of its expecta-
tions. T he team had srrong individ -
ual performances that did not 
translate into a strong overall score 
for the men or women. 

"We were playing for pride, and 
had a few bad breaks that kept us 
from winning because we were 
within a few points of doing bet-
ter, " Salerno said. 

On the women' team, Sagrario 
Hernandez took center stage by win-
ning the shot put and finishing a 
close second in the hammer throw. 

Hernandez' throw of 171-5 In 
the hammer throw is a sc hool 
record. Both her throw and her 
first-place effort in the hot put 
were AA DiviSion II proviSion-
al qualifying marks. 

Sophomore Kendra anape fin-
ished first in the high Jump at 5-1\, 
which also tied the eXisting UCSD 
school record and met the , CAA 
DiviSion II prOVisional quahfying 
standard. 

Senior Jadae Vu catapulted to 
second in the pole vault with a Icap 
of 11 -3, also a CAA D,VISion II 
provisional quahfying performance. 

DIsta.nce runner Audrey Sling's 
performance in the S,OOO-meter 
race with a time of 17 :25.97 was her 

second AA Division II provi-
sional qualifying performance. 

Despite the individual efforts, 
the women were relegated to the 
fourth spot in the c10sc com pen-
rion after being narrowly beaten by 
UC Riverside. 

The women's teams finish ed 111 
the following order: UC Irvine 
with 199 points, U Santa Barbara 
with 159.5 points, UC Riverside 
with ISS points and C D with 
142.5 points. 

On the other hand, the men's 
team did a little beller, finishll1g 
third, close on the heel of UCI, 
which only scored nine poi nts 
ahead of them. 

Junior Butch LermJ was the 
sole event willner with J long jump 
of 22-8.

Tntons rebound from 

their poor showing 
on March 1 with a 

strong performance 
on March 8. 

MONDAY 
MARCH 10, 2003 

Bonnies are 
quitters for 
forfeiting 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

W hats the deal WIth college basketball lately' candals have wept 
through the CAA m the past week 
at Villanova and at both Georgia and 
Rhode Island. 

But perhaps the most interesting 
story of all came when players at St. 
Bonaventure last week voted to for-
feit their last two games of the sea-
son and stop playing after their con-
ference (the Atlantic 10) suspended 
them from the conference tourna-
ment at the end of the season. 

In other words, they quit. And 
their coaches and adrnini tration let 
them. 

Then I thought: Maybe it's not a 
bad idea and quitting is the answer. 

Perhaps the Sacramento Kmgs 
should just quit: They can't beat the 
Laxers in the playoffs, right' So why 
even play? But without the Kings, 
the BA playoffs would have been 
nght up there with MMW 4 as some 
of the most boring stuff I could have 
done dunng my orne here at UCSD. 

UCLA should defirutely quit. 
They have to play No. 1 Ariwna m 
the first round of the Pac-1 0 tourna-
ment. Their coach probably would-
n't mmd. 

Maybe after J got a "C" on the 
last paper J write for a difficult class, 
I should Just qwt the class. 

The problem is that the players 
at l. Bonaventure didn't have a 
proverbial WW" dropped on them by 
the school. Tne gutless adrninistra-
oon and staff let this happen and 
people are losing thier jobs. 

"I aid we have to play, but they 
said they need to hear It from the 
admmlStraoon as to why t1us was 
happenmg," said Bonnles' head 
coach Jan van Breda Kolff, who's 
been placed on admiruStraove leave. 

The players were frustrated when 
a player on their team was ruled mel-
19ible because he didn't really earn 
an associates degree. 

Van Breda Kolff and the rest of 
the admmJstraoon dJdn't nllnd when 
the player~ refused to play 

"My hean goes out to the play-
ers," said fonner St. Bonaventure 
PreSident Roben J. Wickenhelser. 

\lVlckenhelser has since been 
fired over the inCident. 

WI spoke with one of the players 
last everung, and he shared With me 
the feelmgs of hurt and confusIOn 
the team has about not bemg able 
to play In the tournament," 
WickenhClser said. "I very much 
sympathize with the CJnotions they 
are feeling at this time." 

At a time when the young men 
on the SL Bonaventure basketball 
team needed leadership to guide 
them through a trying time, isn't it 
ruce to know that the school has such 
land and sympathetic leaders? 

The bonom line is that people 
(athletes or not) with great minds 
don 't often quit. Michael Jordan, the 
greatest basketball player ever, tried. 
Twice. He's still playing because of 
the drive he has to play basketball. 

Apparently, that kind of drive is 
unknown to the people at St. 
Bonaventure.

Ran ked o. 14 nationally, UCSD 
women's tennis played three home 
matches over the past five days and 
was heavily favored against each of tile 
three teams It faced . 

The Tntons dominated Pittsburgh 
on March 5, winning 7-2. Then over 
the weekend, UCSD dropped Just one 
point in wins over SU Los Angeles 
(9-0) and an Francisco State (8- 1). 

Against a non-conference, Division 
I opponent in Pittsburgh, the Tritons 
used the match as a measuring stick and 
didn't put much pressure on themselves 
because the match wasn't going to have 
an impact in the conference standings.

the Wildcats their fifth lo.s in a row, 
whtle UCSD Improved its record to 9-

DIVIsion I and the Irnons are DiviSion 
II , UCSD was clearly the better team. 

"The competition wasn't as trong 
as o ur learn I . We were able to do 
pretty well ... [Villanova] tried hard, 
but they're not quite at our level. We 
did fine, and we did what we needed to 
do," said UCSD head coach Ene 
Steidlrnayer. 

Playing at No. 1 in single was
