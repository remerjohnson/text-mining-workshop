The Student Organized Voter 
Access Committee at UCSD is not 
under investigation for committing 
voter registration violation, despite 
allegations published in an article from 
the California Review, a conservative 
newspaper. 

The California Review story 
which appeared online on Nov. 5, 
claimed that SOVAC had violated 
registration protocol initiatives—
such as handing out wristbands to 
newly registered voters—that could 
be construed as “paying” for votes, 

SOVAC 
Falsely 
Accused of 
Violations

Over 300 students gathered in the 
Great Hall to watch the presidential 
election results on election night. 
Students who attended the event, billed 
as “Election Night 2012: A Political 
Party” and hosted by UCSD’s politi-
cal science department, watched CBS 
coverage of President Barack Obama’s 
re-election after a panel of student 
leaders discussed the importance of 
the 2012 election.

The event began at 7:30 p.m. with 
the student panel — which consisted 
of A.S. President Meggie Le, Student 
Organized Voter Access Committee 
Executive Associate Kyle Heiskala and 
Guardian Managing Editor Margaret 
Yau.

Le said that UCSD now has one of 
the highest numbers of registered vot-
ers compared to other UC campuses, 
a large improvement from a few years 
ago, when UCSD had the lowest num-
bers of all the UC campuses. 

“For so long, we’ve been regarded 
as socially dead and apathetic,” Le said. 
“This year is especially active after hav-
ing hosted the University of California 
Student Association Congress, as well 
as having the USCA president be a 
UCSD undergrad.”

Le said that 28 percent of voters in 
California were students, according to 
election returns. 

“Students controlled the last elec-
tion, so we can do it this year too,” Le 
said. “We don’t realize the amount of 
influence we have.”

Student panel members discussed 
the various changes that would take 
place in relation to Proposition 30.

 “The people of California have 
voiced that they do prioritize educa-
tion, and it’s the state’s turn to take 
action on it now,” Le said.

Heiskala said the total number of

Thousands of student voters participate in historic 
presidential election. 

By AleKsAndrA KonstAntinovic 
Contributing Writer

California voters passed five out of 11 ballot measures on Tuesday, includ-ing Proposition 30, which will raise taxes on high-income taxpayers and prevent trigger cuts to education. San Diego voters also chose Bob Filner as the city’s first Democratic mayor in 20 years and Scott Peters as the 
projected winner of a close congressional election for the 52nd Congressional District.

Proposition 30 will increase taxes on earnings over $250,000 for seven years, and 
increases California sales tax by one-fourth of a cent for four years. Gov. Jerry Brown 
campaigned for its passage, which prevents planned budget cuts to education in the 
2012–13 fiscal year.

At UCSD’s “Election Night 2012: A Political Party,” an event hosted by the political 
science department, student leaders spoke about the importance of the election and 
discussed several of the propositions on the ballot. A.S. President Meggie Le empha-
sized that, without Proposition 30, the university system would face cuts affecting the

university and student life, from librar-
ies to student activities.

UCSD played host to eight polling 
stations, including one in Price Center 
Ballroom West, one at each college and 
one in The Village. The off-campus 
Mesa Apartments also had a polling 
station. 

The opportunity to vote was excit-
ing for some students, and for many it 
was the first time voting.

“I just turned 18 recently, so it’s 
my first step to being an adult,” Sixth 
College freshman Jake Espinueva said. 
“And I’m so excited. And then my par-
ents want me to vote”. 

Espinueva was not the only student 
who was eager to vote.

“[It is] my civic duty as a citizen 
to vote, so I went and I studied what I 
was going to vote for,” Warren College 
junior Jennifer Protsman said. “We get 
a lot of rights as citizens, and we have 
a lot of protected rights, and I feel vot-
ing is something that is necessary to 
uphold what we want. We can’t just sit 
around and complain about things — 
if we want change, we have to be the 
ones to do it.”

Other students were glad to have 
voted, but acknowledged their lack of 
information about the different propo-
sitions and the different candidates.

“I’ve only paid attention to the 
presidential campaign — I don’t really 
know a lot about the other options 
on the ballot — so I just give a quick 
glance at the little description, and I 

just voted based on that,” Marshall 
College senior Anthony Chan said. 

Mark G. Yudof, the president of the 
UC system, commended the success of 
Proposition 30.

“The passage of Proposition 30 rep-
resents an opportunity for California 
and its political leadership to put pub-
lic higher education back on a pathway 
toward fiscal stability,” Yudof wrote in 
a press release. “This is an opportu-
nity of great importance, not only to 
the University of California and other 
higher education segments, but also to 
the state as a whole.”

The UC Board of Regents, which 
planned to raise tuition mid-year by 
$2,400 if Proposition 30 failed, also 
expressed its support. 

“I am deeply grateful to all who 
advocated for Proposition 30,” 
University of California Chairman of 
the Board of Regents Sherry Lansing 
wrote in the Nov. 7 statement. “We 
will remain steadfast in our determi-
nation to preserve the quality, access 
and public service that have made the 

University of California an indispens-
able resource for the entire state.”

Other measures passed include 
Proposition 35, which will raise 
fines for human trafficking viola-
tors; Proposition 36, which will 
modify California’s three-strikes law, 
Proposition 39, which will tax multi-
state businesses based on their sales in 
California and Proposition 40, a refer-
endum affirming the state Senate dis-
trict boundaries drawn by the Citizens’ 
Redistricting Commission. 

Voters defeated Proposition 
38, a rival tax bill to Gov. Brown’s 
Proposition 30 that aimed to increase 
income taxes across the board.

Other defeated measures includ-
ed Proposition 37, which required 
labels for genetically engineered 
foods; Proposition 34, which intend-
ed to abolish the death penalty in 
California, Proposition33, which 
would have allowed auto insurance 
companies to lower their rates for 
customers with previous coverage, 
Proposition 32, which would have let 

corporations and unions contribute 
to politicians using payroll deduc-
tions and Proposition 31, which 
would have created a two-year budget 
cycle for the state and reduced annual 
revenue by $200 million. 

San Diego’s congressional election 
remained contested in the early hours 
of Wednesday morning, with Port 
Commissioner Scott Peters maintain-
ing a narrow lead over his opponent, 
U.S. Representative Brian Bilbray, by 
just 685 votes. According to NBC San 
Diego, Bilbray reminded his support-
ers that the final result could be days 
away, with 475,000 absentee ballots 
still to be counted. 

In the San Diego mayoral race, 
Democratic Congressman Bob 
Filner triumphed over Republican 
City Councilmember Carl DeMaio 
to become the 35th mayor of the 
city. Filner will take office on Dec. 
3 and will work with a Democratic 
majority in the city council.

students SOVAC registered in 2012 
was over 5,000, a notable improve-
ment from the 4,000 UCSD students 
who were registered to vote in 2008. 
Heiskala said SOVAC looks forward to 
continuously increasing this number. 

“Through voting, students are 
shaping the way the government will 
interact with students in the future,” 
Yau said. “Whatever way you chose to 
vote, you have a made a difference.”

A brief panel of faculty members 
followed the student panel. 

All presentations ended at 8 p.m. , 
when the attendees resumed watching 

election night results. Updates on elec-
tion results were broadcast live from 
CBS on a large screen. Many students 
were Obama supporters and cheered 
loudly as the number of electoral votes 
for Obama increased. Once Ohio’s 
winning vote was confirmed, the room 
erupted into applause and cheers, with 
sudent chanting, “Four more years.”

Political Science professor Thad 
Kousser said it was no surprise that 
majority of the students in the room 
were fervent Obama supporters.

“Students are always more lib-
eral than the rest of society, and 
Californians are more liberal than 
everyone,” Kousser said. “But I think 

we did see some Ron Paul supporters, 
some Mitt Romney supporters, and we 
saw that college students at UCSD are 
not a political monolith.”

Once presidential results were 
announced at around 8:15 p.m., 
Kousser held a quick wrap-up panel 
and brought the event to an early close.

“There are two ironies that come 
with the re-election of Obama,” 
Kousser said. “First, Obama will come 
to eclipse Bill Clinton as the great mod-
ern Democratic president, although 
Clinton greatly helped Obama’s cam-
paign. Second, California voted demo-
cratically for the electoral vote, yet a 
conservative view is reflected in the 

proposition results.”
Le said that students could expect 

to keep certain government pro-
grams protected for the next four 
years, including funding for higher 
education, student loan accessibility, 
and protected healthcare programs. 
Obama established permanent reform 
for federal institutions and plans to 
help fund higher education for mid-
dle- and lower-class families, such as 
the American Opportunity Tax Credit.

“[Obama] also sides with more 
of the progressive issues,” Le said. “I 
think that’s something college students 
are specifically interested in and that’s 
what we put our heart behind.”

 This event marked the fourth 
time the political science department 
has held an election night involving 
the student body. Kousser said that 
each successive election night event 
has seen a bigger turnout than the 
one before it. Students were respectful 
toward one another’s differing political 
views by refraining from making nega-
tive statements.

“Students have become so engaged 
here, and this year we didn’t even give 
anyone extra credit for showing up,” 
Kousser said.

and therefore violating voter regis-
tration guidelines. It also claimed 
that the group was under investi-
gation by the county registrar and 
could be subject to prosecution.

“While efforts to increase the 
ranks of registered voters can be 
lauded, SOVAC has been doing so 
through efforts that violate state and 
federal election laws and are cur-
rently under investigation by the San 
Diego Registrar of Voters,” former 
California Review Editor-in-Chief 
Patrick Todd wrote in the story.

Multiple sources have said that 
such claims are false and possibly fal-
sified.

On Tuesday, Darius Kemp, a 
spokesperson for the nine-campus 
UC Student Association, said that 
he had spoken with representatives 
from the California Secretary of 
State’s office, who said that there was 
no investigation in progress and that 
the California Review story relied 
heavily on falsified information.

“There is no evidence of any 
investigation involving SOVAC at 

UCSD,” Kemp said. “Usually when 
someone is under investigation, they 
are the first to know. SOVAC has not 
received any letter from either the 
secretary of state or the San Diego 
Registrar of Voters.”

San Diego Registrar of Voters 
Deborah Seiler confirmed Tuesday 
that her office is not investigating 
SOVAC.

“I am unaware of any investiga-
tion at UCSD,” Seiler said. “Unless 
SOVAC members [were] working 
as poll workers, which to the best of 
our knowledge, they were not, there 
isn’t anything to investigate.”

Kemp said that everything that 
SOVAC did to encourage voter reg-
istration, including the wristband 
initiative, complied with registrar 
guidelines.

“It’s absolutely OK to hand out 
incentives while you register vot-
ers, as long as you don’t deny the 
giveaways to people who don’t want 
to register,” Kemp said. “California 
Review has an ulterior motive to 
stop or discredit SOVAC’s efforts to 
register voters in San Diego.”

SOVAC Executive Associate 

Kyle Heiskala affirmed that none of 
the group’s activities, including the 
wristband initiative, were violating 
any rules.

“If we were under investigation, 
we would have been called and 
we haven’t been called,” he said. “I 
would not know why the California 
Review would specifically target our 
organization with false information.”

California Review members 
posted a statement on its website late 
Monday night stating the SOVAC 
article had been published without 
proper fact-checking. As of press 
time, an updated version of the arti-
cle has been posted on the website.

California Review Editor-in-
Chief Cody Dunn said that the 
paper’s editorial board maintains 
that the content of the story is true.

“We are still in the process of 
updating the article and gathering 
our sources,” Dunn said. “We are not 
going to retract the article. We do 
believe it is correct.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

No one should be surprised that 
the world’s premier public univer-
sity wants in on the most pervasive 
trend in higher education: online 
learning. In 2010, before the current 
explosion in online classes, open 
courseware and numerous flashy 
start-ups, the UC system created the 
UC Pilot Instruction program with 
the hope of offering for-credit online 
classes. Two years on, the program 
has finally launched its first classes 
and is on the brink of opening said 
classes to non-UC students. If pro-
gram administrators can get their act 
together, this would be a welcome 
move that could be tailored to help 
our transfer students and address 
the problem of impacted community 
college classes.

In many ways, the UC Pilot 
Instruction program has bucked 
the trend of online learning. While 
other universities made their classes 
available for free online long ago, 

albeit without offering credit — for 
example, the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology put its first courses 
online in 2002 — the UC pilot pro-
gram is not only late, but lacks cohe-
sion. Within the system’s 10 campus-
es, UC Irvine has been part of the 
open courseware trend since 2006, 
and UC Berkeley recently joined 
EdX, a high-profile online educa-
tion collaboration between MIT and 
Harvard University. Given that many 
of the UC system’s own campuses 
have put their efforts elsewhere — 
and especially in light of the rumor 
that EdX will start offering course 
credit — the pilot program needs 
to publicize itself more effectively 
to ensure that the various campuses 
don’t start negotiating online educa-
tion arrangements of their own.

Not to mention that online 
learning is so new that it lies at the 
center of multiple debates about the 
effectiveness of the teaching strategy 

and the “value” of a degree when 
classes are democratized. Luckily, 
the UC pilot program avoids the 
second issue by specifically stating 
that it is a non-degree program. This 
is a good idea: Until scholars have a 
better idea of how comparable edu-
cation is when delivered online and 
how such programs affect an institu-
tion, UC degrees should still require 
stringent residency requirements. 

That said, online classes, and 
especially the move toward opening 
them to non-UC students, could be 
the solution to an inefficient transfer 
system. With ceaseless budget cuts, 
enrollment cuts and increasingly 
impacted classes, hopeful transfers 
are often stuck in the community 
college system for more years than 
necessary, simply because they are 
unable to take the basic lower-div 
requirements necessary to transfer 
to a UC or CSU campus. Then, once 
finally at a UC campus, the night-

mare of transferable credit begins, 
leading to many transfers staying 
more than the planned-for two 
years. 

The new initiative of opening 
classes to non-UC students should 
focus on alleviating this problem by 
having program developers work 
specifically to create lower-division 
classes that fill associate’s degree 
requirements. Program administra-
tions should sign agreements with 
our California community colleges 
to let their UC-bound students take 
a majority of their requirements 
online. Not only would this avoid 
the tricky question of whether tak-
ing upper-division UC classes online 
is the same as having a “UC educa-
tion,” such a move would go further 
toward open access and addressing 
the specific challenges of obtaining 
a UC education than simply offering 
classes to the general public.

the UCSd Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San diego. Contents © 2012. 
Views expressed herein represent the majority vote of the 
editorial board and are not necessarily those of the UC 
Board of regents, the aSUCSd or the members of the 

Guardian staff. 

This time of year, men do what we do most effortlessly — we grow facial hair. Just as the first 
week of No Shave November is com-
ing to an end, your stubble is prob-
ably getting itchy. But don’t shave yet. 
Once you’re over the week one itching 

hump, it’s not that bad. Two years ago 
a Guardian columnist argued against 
participating in No Shave November 
on the grounds that not shaving our 
faces will lead to not shaving lawns 
which will surely end in the downfall 
of society (“When No One Shaves, 
Everyone Loses”). But I support No 
Shave November because this month 
we can embrace our beards without 
judgment.   

In a nutshell, your reasons for 
shaving this month are bogus. I think 
the main reason men opt out and 
shave this month is because they’re 
not sure how they’ll look with facial 
hair. But November is the one time of 
year when we can test our beards. The 
best part about this is that because 
it’s a month centered around beard 
solidarity, everyone else is growing out 
his beard too. Your beard will likely 
avoid most criticism by blending in 
with the rest.  

Beard- and bro-haters alike may 
note that beards aren’t for everyone. 
But neither is cliff jumping. Yet if 
someone were manly enough to cliff 
jump, you wouldn’t criticize him for 
looking ridiculous doing it. Same 
thing with growing a beard. Maybe 
they’re just not seeing the big picture.

It turns out No Shave November 
spawned off from Movember, where 
Mo Bros sport mustaches for the 
month. The Movember Foundation 
helps promote the tradition globally to 
raise money for philanthropic causes 
aimed at “changing the face of men’s 
health.” By the way, the Movember 
Foundation raised $126 million last 
year alone.

In the last decade Movember 
morphed into America’s No Shave 
November, which, because no part of 
the face is shaved, is more environ-

Any amount of shaving cream or 
beard trimmings can be toxic to 
cute oceanic creatures like dolphins 
and sea lions. By not shaving, you’re 
almost single-handedly saving 
planet Earth. This also explains why 
Greenpeace volunteers on Library 
Walk have gnarly beards.

The number one biggest critic of 
No Shave November is the girlfriend. 
She does not like your beard. Nor do 
her friends. And while communica-
tion in a relationship is key, facial hair, 
at least for me, is non-negotiable. Let’s 
be real, beards are real chill. Though, I 
should note that your bros will under-
stand if you have to shave for an inter-
view. Sometimes, getting a job trumps 
being chill.

Personally, my five o’clock shadow 
is starting to tick past 2 a.m.  The only 
downside is that people I bump into 
on campus want to talk about how 
long I’ve gone without trimming.  But 
I can’t complain.  I can comfortably 
sit at the Art of Espresso and look like 
I’m working on my thesis.  And my 
face is warm while I’m doing it.

Thanks to the 53.9 percent of California vot-ers who approved the governor’s beloved Proposition 30 on Tuesday, we’ve dodged a 
bullet. But we’re not out of the woods yet.

Because of this proposition our tuition will not 
go up this year, which will raise an estimated $6 
billion in new revenues to balance the state budget 
through higher sales and income taxes. Proposi-
tion 30 spares us from more fee hikes for the time 
being, but, if the state government doesn’t work to 
end cuts to education in the legislature, the trend 
of tuition increases will continue.

Our tuition costs will stay the same as last  year, 
thanks to a state government promise of $125 
million in funding in exchange for keeping 2012 
tuition at the 2011 level. While Proposition 30’s 
passage gives us some breathing room, California 
legislators should renew the $125 million promise 
of stable tuition next year to keep UC tuition 
affordable and prevent fee  increases in the near 
future.

Gov. Brown gambled with our futures by tying 
trigger cuts to Proposition 30’s failure. Higher 
education in California is supposedly a priority, 
yet our state government is putting it up as col-
lateral for balancing the state budget. Since prison 
spending now outpaces higher education spending 
and California is only the fourth-largest funder of 
the UC system (behind the federal government, 

private giving and tuition), it is clear that educa-
tion is rapidly becoming the state’s trophy wife—
nice to admire, but there isn’t necessarily a lot of 
substance to the relationship. 

 Fortunately the governor’s plan worked, but 
the burden of balancing the state’s budget should 
not fall on the backs of students. The state does 
not demonstrate a commitment to investing  in 
UC and CSU students when it is willing to alienate 
thousands of lower-income students to punish 
anti-tax increase voters.

 Gov. Brown formed and pitched Proposition 
30 well. The sales tax increase that will take effect 
next year is relatively modest, and the income tax 
hikes on individuals making $250,000 and couples 
making $500,000 or more will only affect a small 
portion of Californians. The sales tax, even at the 
new level, will be lower than it was before a previ-
ous hike expired July 2011. Though the proposi-
tion was well designed, this does not excuse the 
fact that students would have paid the price had it 
not passed.

 Proposition’s 30 passage marks the first time 
since 2004 that voters actually supported a tax 
increase. The governor bullied us into support-
ing the measure, giving voters an ultimatum  by 
tying  $375 million in trigger cuts to the University 

Election results, especially the passing of  Prop 30, favored students — but we 
shouldn’t remain complacent in the face of  tuition increases.

O n the bus headed toward Old Town Transit Center last Saturday, I spotted a trio of bros in Hawaiian 
shirts making leis out of pretzels. The 
rest of the bus stared at them in dis-
belief — myself included — yet they 
seemed unfazed and giddy as they 
continued to slip the snacks through 
their twine.

“What are the pretzel leis for?”  I 
finally asked.

 “San Diego beer fest,” they replied, 
in what I like to think was perfect 
unison.

Turns out, these dudes go to a lot 
of beer fests together, so they’ve estab-
lished the traditions of Hawaiian garb 
and wearable food. (The beer bong 
had been taken away too many times 
to bring anymore.)  I happened to be 
on my way to the same place, since I 
happily accepted a press pass to go try 
some of San Diego’s finest craft beers 
at the Brewer’s Guild Festival, the cap-
stone event to the annual San Diego 
Beer Week, now in its fifth run this 
year from Nov. 2 to Nov. 11.

There are over 60 breweries in the 
county, meaning that San Diego has 

the most breweries per capita of any 
city in America. While many pock-
ets of the country have thriving beer 
scenes (Oregon and Colorado, for 
instance), San Diego has made a name 
for itself as having the most creative 
and diverse beer scene of the bunch.

Though the scene has grown 
more and more commercial over the 
years, with Escondido’s Stone Brewing 
Company becoming the flagship 
brewery of southern California, ties 
to its home brewing roots remain 
strong. Take Ballast Point Brewing and 
Spirits, one of the city’s most celebrated 
breweries. It was founded in 1996 
as a spin-off of Home Brew Mart, a 
store dedicated to the home brewing 
process. Co-founder and Head Brewer 
and one-time UCSD student Yuseff 
Cherney told me more over email.

“When we opened the Home 
Brew Mart in 1992, there were only a 
handful of brewpubs operating in San 
Diego,” he wrote. “The home brewing 
scene was very strong with clubs like 
Quaff leading the charge to appreciate

I first watched “The Big Bang Theory” on a 15-hour flight from Hong Kong. In my petulant state, 
I delighted in the fact that they had 
stopped playing “What to Expect 

When You’re Expecting” and that 
finally, there was a show about geeks, 
for geeks. I now know what bad food 
and a horrifying lack of sleep can 
do to a person’s judgment, because I 
was so wrong about “The Big Bang 
Theory.” It’s not the catchphrases 
(Bazinga!) that get me, or the show’s 
descent into “The Sheldon Show.” No, 
it’s the fact that Chuck Lorre does 
not know how to write a show about 
self-professed nerds without utterly 
bastardizing the culture. 

For non-viewers, “The Big Bang 
Theory” is a character-centric sitcom 
that follows the nerdy happenings of 
three physicists (Jim Parsons, Johnny 
Galecki, Kunal Nayyar), one engineer 
(Simon Helberg) and their hot neigh-
bor (Kaley Cuoco). Though the leads 
are presumably doing crucial research 
in CalTech, the show spends a mini-
mal amount of time in the lab and a 
whole lot of time in the comic book 
store. Because that’s what nerds do.

What is so utterly pedestrian about 
the show, and what critics have long 
hated, is that “The Big Bang Theory” 
is basically the public perception of 
nerds. Each of the four main charac-
ters are more socially inept than the 
next: While Leonard thankfully func-
tional, Howard is a creepy momma’s 
boy, Raj is an accented foreigner who 
can’t talk to women unless drunk, and 
Sheldon is essentially an asexual. 

The main issue with the show is 
that in terms of geek culture, the show 
overextends itself. Go to any Con and 
look around — the anime fans are not 
in any way like the Browncoats, the 
Trekkies are doing their own thing. 
I’ve been to Comic-Con twice, and 
I can tell you that I have still never 
read manga (pronounced with a long 
“a”). Take Sheldon and Leonard’s 
apartment as an example. What the 
set designers think the room screams 
(look at these huge nerds!), screams 
a ThinkGeek.com advertisement to 
everybody else. “Hmm,” you can prac-
tically hear them thinking. “What do 
nerds like?” Clearly, the consensus was 
molecular structures, Green Lantern 
memorabilia and Rubik’s Cubes. “Ha 
ha,” laughs Middle America. “I have 
seen these items before and identify 
with how they frame nerd culture.”

To compare, let’s look at a winning 
example of a nerd show, written by 
geek goddess Felicia Day, “The Guild.” 
The show plays off of Day’s real-life 
obsession: MMORPG games like the 
World of Warcraft. The characters, 
though they follow archetypes, are 
fully fleshed out and more impor-
tantly, realistic. Clara is a middle-aged 
mother who often ignores her chil-
dren for raids, and Tink is an Asian 
“mean girl” who loves video games 
but scoffs at the debilitating awkward-
ness of her guild. Additionally, “The 
Guild” focuses episodes on realistic 
problems, like trying to get free inter-
net connection as a frugal gamer. 

Of course, I should mention that 
“The Guild” is an online-only show, 
while “The Big Bang Theory” is five 
seasons deep on a Big Five channel. 
Maybe in the future, we will have a 
television show that accurately cap-
tures a segment of geek, is widely 
viewed and not produced by Chuck 
Lorre, but I’m not holding my breath. 

For Nerd 
Culture, It’s 
Just a Big 
Bang Bust

t he title “I Am Not A Hipster,” though provocative, is decep-tive. Many may be expecting a comedy wherein a carica-tured protagonist spends the duration of the film futilely denying the label. Others, perhaps, might perceive a tale 
of the plight and prejudice faced by misunderstood, mustachioed 
indie-rock lovers.

“[The movie] isn’t really about that,” lead producer Ron Najor 
told the Guardian. “I feel like a lot of people kind of want to hate 
this movie. The story is really about an artist — or just a person — 
dealing with his life.”

Director and writer Destin Cretton, Najor himself and many 
others behind the film hail from San Diego and thus chose to set 
their semi-fictional film against the backdrop of San Diego’s art 
and music scene. The plot follows Brook (Dominic Bogart), a 
musician who, despite his burgeoning notoriety, is in agony fol-
lowing the death of his mother and a recent breakup. Meanwhile, 
Brook’s abrasive smugness is not enough to keep away his 
three cheery sisters (Tammy Minoff, Lauren Coleman, Kandis 
Erickson), his friend/manager Clarke (Alvaro Orlando) or his 
estranged father (Michael Harris). 

“When you go into a movie, and you don’t know what the 
movie is, I kind of like that... you’re kind of expecting something 

else,” Najor said. “What I’m hoping people get out of it is kind of 
fulfilling.”

In the movie, Brook’s fictional band, the Canines, have 
achieved indie fame, but for Brook the success is no refuge from 
his anguish. 

“Sometimes when things are tragic and to keep going in your 
life is kind of hard, one thing that the main character does is he 
uses music, and for him it’s just very difficult to figure out what 
that means and sort of what the next step is,” Najor said. “I think 
everyone has their obstacles and challenges, and that was our main 
character’s challenge.”

The themes of loss are made all the more striking by the film’s 
music — a hand-picked soundtrack from rising San Diego indie 
bands including The Donkeys, Cuckoo Chaos and Jamuel Saxon, 
available for listening on the film’s website (iamnotahipster.com). 
San Diego composer Joel P. Smith wrote the songs that Bogart 
performs in the film himself, and Najor attests that all the perfor-
mances were recorded in one take in order to produce a “very real 
and raw sound.”

“The way that Joel structured it, the music tells a story that

Sweet Sixteen
Steven Spielberg tackles the life and times of the great (non-vampire 
hunting) emancipator, Abraham Lincoln.
By Vincent Pham • contriButing Writer

If this year’s “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” didn’t instill you with the badassery of 
our 16th president, Steven 
Spielberg’s more conven-
tional approach might just 
do the trick.

“Lincoln” is set dur-
ing the final stages of the 
Civil War — more par-
ticularly, during the pass-
ing of the 13th Amendment. An 
urgent President Lincoln (Daniel 
Day-Lewis) along with his shrewd 
Secretary of State William Seward 
(David Strathairn) assemble a rowdy 
trio of lobbyists (James Spader, John 
Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson) to gain 
patronage for these, at the time, “radi-
cal” Democrats. The war progresses as 
the House begins to sway in favor of 
amending the Constitution, and dur-
ing these trying times Lincoln is not 
only shown as a politician, but as a 
fatherly figure. Robert Lincoln (Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt) returns home to pro-
test for his enlistment in the Union 

Army while the underexposed Mary 
Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) despairs 

over his safety. Personal 
and political strife 
intertwine and give the 
impression of Lincoln’s 
formidable tempera-
ment in any situation. 
He shows compassion 
and understanding 
toward those whom he 

affects with his policy but also exhib-
its an unrelenting and stern attitude 
toward his Cabinet.

The supporting cast, who deserved 
much more screen time, becomes 
indispensable players to what makes 
the film so poignant. An adamant 
Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) and a rev-
erent Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee 
Jones) become the focal points of the 
rising action — the vote on the 13th 
Amendment. Taking place in a crowd-
ed enclosure, the seemingly slow pace 
of counting votes becomes tense and 
agonizing. Filmed with peculiarly 
realistic setting, lighting and old-age 

mannerisms, the film draws you into 
the 1860s, where the lack of proper 
ventilation is quite palpable. What 
becomes so effective in the scene, 
and the film in its entirety, is how 
moments of non-action become the 
ones that are the most riveting.

Where the film falls short is the 
elevated representation of Lincoln 
as president. Spielberg is known to 
venerate historical genres to unreal-
istic heights, but the cinematography, 
musical score and stupendous cast 
greatly override those airs. And of 
course, historical interpretation and 
accuracy does affect the viewer. 
Spielberg renders Lincoln in a way 
that the audience may interpret him 
as a moral advocate of anti-slavery, 
although, as history knows, Lincoln 
did away with slavery to preserve the 
Union and uphold the Constitution — 
not because of his own moral beliefs. 
With the Battle of Wilmington placed 
anachronistically, most of the finer 
historical details do go unnoticed 
to the common viewer, but do not 

detract from what is at hand.
Surprisingly, splashes of humor 

adorn the script as alleviators of tense 
situations. Senators and representa-
tives deliver witty insults to their 
opposing peers and our very own 
Lincoln doles out anecdotes of seem-
ingly un-relatable situations to draw a 
laugh when it is most needed.

In the end, you are left with a 
refreshed memory of Lincoln’s his-
tory. Lincoln was one of the presidents 
you remembered most because, well, 
he was Lincoln. But this isn’t like the 
pages from your high school history 
textbook — in the film, Spielberg 
transforms a historical figure into a 
historical hero. Memorable perfor-
mances immerse into what you wish 
you had learned in class.

W hen I tried online dating last year, I learned a lot more about myself than the kinds 
of guys I was dating. I learned 
that I liked the chase despite 

how frustrating it could be. I like 
meeting guys organically; it feels 
like more of an achievement to have 
met someone outside of the safety 
of my laptop. And I learned that 
whether I met someone online or 
otherwise, I still did not like the 
three-day rule. 

Two weeks ago I went to a 
Major Lazer concert with a bunch 
of friends. We had an absolutely 
amazing time and despite the 
loud music, huge crowd and my 
dilated eyeballs, I was able to meet 
someone. Jason* and I danced a 
bit, talked, exchanged numbers and 
went out on a date the following 
weekend. We got gelato in 
downtown La Jolla, walked around, 
made fun of the ridiculous art 
galleries and had a great goodnight 
kiss. He wasn’t my usual type (I 
don’t even really know what that is), 
but he was funny, handsome and 
polite. There was also the added 
bonus that he had absolutely no

of a boom, with quite a few brew-
eries opening. . .[but] it wasn’t really 
until a few years ago that craft beer 
really experienced a huge resurgence, 
completely eclipsing the boom of the 
’90s.”

Ballast Point still maintains a spe-
cialty brewery at its original Home 
Brew Mart location, which “allows 
us to be very experimental with our 
beers and keep true to our roots as 
craft brewers,” Cherney said. 

This dedication to home brewing 
culture is prevalent among nearly 
all the breweries in town — a fact 
made startlingly clear to me as soon 
as I walked into the Brewer’s Guild 
Festival at the Broadway Pier on 
Saturday Nov. 2. Faced with a crowd 
of hundreds of beer lovers and rows 
of colorful tents stocked with kegs, I 
felt more than a little out of my ele-
ment. I’m from Livermore, Calif., 
a small town in the outer East Bay 

Area, known for being home to over 
40 wineries and more than 5,000 
acres of vineyards. I love beer, but I 
was raised on vino.

So after filling my complimentary 
tasting glass with Ballast Point’s rum 
barrel-aged “Victory at Sea” Imperial 
Porter, I was tempted to swirl and 
smell. Inspired by Cherney’s declara-
tion, “I can’t wait for the day that we 
can fill our barrels with beer after we 
age our spirits,” this brew was made 
by aging Ballast Point Three Sheets 
Rum in a barrel for two years, filling 
it with Ballast Point’s limited edition 
Imperial Porter “Victory at Sea” and 
then aging it for two more years. 
Ballsat Point emptied the barrel in 
June, but to continue the experiment, 
they refilled it with more of their 
Three Sheets Rum, two years from 
now they’ll make 200 bottles.

It’s this kind of taste for experi-
mentation that makes San Diego 
breweries so unique. I tried a number 
of odd flavors throughout the day, 

including a peanut butter cup porter 
from Karl Strauss, a coffee stout from 
Coronado Brewing Co. and a spe-
cial version of Ballast Point’s Smoke 
Screen, a smoked Helles, that was 
infused with jalapeños. The latter was 
a fun experiment, but I’d rather not 
have my hops be so fiery. My person-
al favorite was a medium-bodied IPA 
with an easy-to-drink touch of pine, 
courtesy of Green Flash Brewing Co.

While the crowd at the event was 
mostly of the over-30 variety, (sorry) 
college students shouldn’t fear the 
craft beer. While the brewers encour-
age patrons to sip ale like wine, there’s 
no need to dissect the notes. Liking 
the beer seemed to be enough for 
everyone in attendance — not to 
mention the excellent food pairings 
supplied by Craft & Commerce (meat 
ball sliders), Hamilton’s Tavern (spicy 
beer cheese soup), Swieners (sausage, 
of course) and more. 

If anything, the craft beer scene 
is putting San Diego on the map, 

even at an international level. Just 
this week three San Diego brewer-
ies won top awards at the inaugural 
Brussels Beer Challenge in Belgium. 
Stone Brewing Co. and Green Flash 
Brewing Co. earned gold medals 
for their beers, while Ballast Point 
received a bronze. All three bested 
breweries from more traditional beer 
locales such as Germany, the United 
Kingdom and the host country, 
Belgium. Such successes recall the 
1976 wine competition termed the 
“Judgment of Paris,” when California 
wine defeated French wine in a blind 
taste test. Perhaps, then, San Diego is 
now the Napa of beer.

If that’s the case, then Beer Week 
is just like Disneyland for the drunk.

“[It] gives all of our brewers the 
opportunity to interact, shake hands, 
talk their craft and bask in the adora-
tion of the true beer fans,” Cherney 
said. “Consumer recognition goes a 
long way in reaffirming your goals to 
make the best beer in the world.”

Many San Diegos Breweries Are Still Dedicated to Authentic Home Brewing

affiliation with UCSD. And in the 
three days that followed I didn’t 
really worry about him texting me 
because I was pretty sure he would. 

By the fourth day of radio 
silence, I had given up and decided 
to let myself feel shitty about it 
for a few hours and move on. But 
as I was listening to some Alanis 
Morissette while straightening my 
hair (standard girl stuff), I got a 
text. “Hey what’s up? Sorry I haven’t 
texted you. The last couple of days 

have been sort of eventful haha.” I 
know it’s not very feminist of me, 
but this validation relieved me. It 
wasn’t so much about Jason himself, 
it was more about the satisfaction of 
being wanted. He ended up having 
a pretty legitimate reason for not 
calling... something about being 
arrested for public intoxication. 
(Spoiler alert: I don’t end up with 
this guy.) But despite his criminal 
record, going on a second date 
became less important to me now 
that it was on the horizon. I had 
essentially got what I had wanted: 

validation. 
I believe it was Barney Stinson 

of “How I Met Your Mother” who 
said, “We wait three days to call a 
woman back because that’s how long 
Jesus wants us to wait. True story.” 
Well, we all know Barney Stinson is 
a sleezebag so why are normal guys 
(i.e. Ted) taking advice from him 
anyway? I can’t speak for all women 
but I can speak for most of the 
women I know when I say that the 
three-day rule is complete bullshit. 
It’s a convention designed to make 
women feel antsy, self conscious 

and dependent on men for 72 whole 
hours. Men choose not to call the 
very next day because they don’t 
want to seem too eager, but I’ll let 
you in on a little secret: Women 
want men to be eager. Maybe not the 
clingy type of eager, but they want to 
be wanted. And as long as you don’t 
profess your love for them on the 
first date, there’s nothing too eager 
about calling the next day. That is, 
unless, you have a good excuse like, 
I don’t know, being in jail.

Often, the best way to main-tain an exercise routine is to make it something to 
look forward. One way to do that is 
by adding a social element. Movin 
Shoes Wednesday runs encourae 
weekly workouts. 

The group runs take place every 
Wednesday night at 6 p.m., just as 
the name suggests. The group sets 
out from the Movin Shoes store 
in Pacific Beach on a route that is 
approximately five-and-a-half miles 
long, and it is open to athletes of 
all skill levels. The terrain varies, 
but is, for the most, part paved and 
flat, save for one gentle incline near 
a bridge on the route. The uniniti-
ated need not fear starting a new, 
difficult routine, but seasoned run-
ners will still find what they need. 
The length of time the runs require 
is wholly dependent on individual 
skill level, and there is time to ban-

ter and bond with fellow runners. 
Sign-up is not required, and the 
event is always free.

The runs originally began at the 
Movin Shoes location in Mission 
Beach but relocated along with the 
store to their current starting point 
in Pacific Beach. The weekly runs 
have built a loyal following, and as 
a result, a community of devotees 
has sprung up around Movin Shoes. 
The weekly runs have been going 
on for more than 20 years.

But the Wednesday night events 
are more than just an hour or so 
of running. The group encourages 
people to invest in their running 
routines by allowing them to meet 
like-minded individuals for some 
quality time while exercising. A 
few times a year, if a sizable group 
shows up, the group may get pizza 
afterward as well, so you can retox 
after your detox.

Rick Alverson’s “The Comedy” establishes Tim Heidecker as a great 
modern actor, while cracking hipsterdom wide open.
By ren eBel • a&e editor

We’re approaching a thresh-old where the term “hip-ster” has come to describe 
so many different off-putting and ill-
defined charac-
teristics that it’s 
become practi-
cally meaning-
less — a lazy 
cop-out label for 
a faceless group 
of bougie snobs 
who we are 
familiar with, but who no one seems 
to identify with. We know that these 
Twittering, upper class douchebags 
exist, but who exactly are they?

Swanson (Tim Heidecker), the 
unlikable Williamsburg 30-something 
at the center of Rick Alverson’s “The 
Comedy,” is an almost cartoonish 
embodiment of all of these traits: enti-
tled, lazy, insufferably bored and com-
pletely terrified of sincerity. But “The 
Comedy” is no gentle parody of any 
specific cultural subset; it’s an urgent, 
original and at times shockingly real 
investigation of an anesthetized gener-
ation desperate for feeling. And at this 
moment, it feels like a wakeup call. 

Alverson, who also co-wrote the 
script, is acutely familiar with modern 
social interactions (the sarcasm, the 
endless charade of joke built upon 
joke). When Swanson meets an attrac-
tive girl at work — a dishwashing job 
he takes out of pure curiosity — they 
jokingly fire insults at one another as 
a means of flirtation. It’d almost be 
endearing if it weren’t for the fact that 
it’s the only way these characters seem 

capable of communicating.  
In the tradition of “Arthur,” 

“The Comedy” plays as a series of 
Swanson’s day-to-day mundanities, 
following his feeble attempts to fight 
his encroaching ennui by way of 
ironic public performance and idiotic 
stunts. He pays a cab driver $400 to let 
him drive the cab for several minutes. 
He poses as a landscaper in order to 
request that his “guys” swim in their 
wealthy employer’s pool. He and his 
friends (played by fellow “Tim and 
Eric” namesake Eric Wareheim and 
LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy) 
fabricate rituals in a public church.

Much of the film’s realism, how-
ever, can be attributed to Heidecker’s 
performance. Fans of Tim & Eric’s 
Adult Swim sketch show have 
likely surmised that the comedian 
is tremendously talented in veering 
between the slapstick and the very 
dark (see also: the duo’s short films 
“The Terrys” and “Father & Son”). 
Here, Heidecker’s delivery is subtle, as 
Swanson’s sincerity forces its way out 

of endless maddening farce at every 
turn. In one scene, Swanson imitates 
a pre-Civil War slave owner in the 
presence of his unamused sister-in-
law. The amusing act uncomfortably 
overstays its welcome before Swanson 
manages to cough up a sincere ques-
tion about his incarcerated brother. 

The hand-held cinéma vérité style 
lends itself to the anthropological 
nature of the film, but it also makes 
Alverson’s more abstract poetic liber-
ties all the more shocking, as when 
Swanson’s single pathetic romantic 
encounter takes a jarring, surreal turn. 

But “The Comedy” is most 
commendable for its careful decon-
struction of the hipster mythology, 
using its Pabst-guzzling, fixie-riding 
antihero as a microcosm for a much 
larger cultural phenomenon that has 
yet to be scrutinized to this degree in 
contemporary cinema. What’s more 
is that Alverson actually reaches to 
provide us with a few compelling 
answers during the film’s gorgeous 
final minutes.

O n their self-produced seventh studio album, Liverpool-based art-rock outfit Clinic 
turn up the funk. While 2010’s 
“Bubblegum” favored the folksy 
sound of harpsichord and acoustic 
guitar, “Free Reign” moves in an 
opposite, synth-laden direction, using 
sci-fi sound effects to produce a psy-
chedelic trip of an album.

“Free Reign” jams its simple 
organ and synth riffs throughout, 
creating a sense of perpetual motion. 
In “Seesaw,” rhythmic repetition is 
countered by lush swells (produced 
by the melodica, a mini-piano wind 
instrument) calming us before our 
launch. Ade Blackburn hums tenderly 

into the mic as the mellow, alternat-
ing cymbals and organ of “For the 
Season” continue the deceptively 
peaceful trance.

Far-off animal cries usher in “King 
Kong,” where repetitious organ stabs 
evoke an eerie walk across an alien 
terrain, punctuated by distant bongo 
drums, whose corresponding musi-
cians seem to be watching us from a 
distance. 

By the end of the album, it appears 
all is well and we are chilling in a 
cafe, enveloped by the jazz stylings of 
Clinic’s wind instruments in “Sun and 
the Moon.” The serenity dissipates 
though, as Blackburn’s voice becomes 
mufled and the non-musical sound 
effects tear through the song and, 
subsequently, our sense of security.

While “Free Reign” is a gratifying 
surprise, the band’s main elements 
— electric guitar,  wind instruments 
and throaty vocals — remain intact. 
In “Free Reign”, Clinic mixes the usual 
prescription of indie rock with synth 
effects and wind instruments, and the 
result is nothing short of addictive.

goes along with the movie,” Najor 
said. “When you watch the movie and 
then go back and listen to the music, 
it actually makes more sense.”

“Hipster” was swarmed by critical 
acclaim this year at the Sundance Film 
Festival and has been making festival 
rounds across the United States. 

Having attended UCSD himself, 

Najor is very excited show the film 
at Price Center, and he welcomes all 
who liked the film to check out their 
Facebook or twitter (@notahipster-
film). He also encourages visiting the 
website (iamnotahipster.com) where 
the Canines’ album is available.

“I Am Not a Hipster” will screen 
at Price Center Theater tonight, Nov. 
8. Doors at 7:30 pm. Free for students; 
$10 general admission.

of California and California State 
systems to the measure’s failure. The 
cuts would have raised UC tuition by 
$2,400 in January, but after election 
results, UC affordability will live on 
through the spring.

 And that’s the sad thing: The 
governor and his “allies” spent 
months campaigning, easing voter 
registration procedures, and pushing 
support for Proposition 30 (and the 
failure of civil rights attorney Molly 
Munger’s competing tax measure in 
Proposition 38). But Proposition 30 
doesn’t mean the end of tuition hikes 
and budget cuts. By passing Proposi-

tion 30, we only temporarily halted 
the trend of rising tuition. According 
to Student Regent Jonathan Stein, 
we might see another fee increase 
of around 5 percent in fall 2013 and 
possibly more in the years to come.

Democrats in the state legis-
lature picked up a few seats on 
Tuesday night, but not enough to 
have the  two-thirds supermajor-
ity needed to pass tax increases 
in a state where Republicans have 
historically refused to vote in favor 
of any tax-raising bill. When he 
campaigned for the governorship 
two years ago, Brown promised not 
to raise taxes without voters’ permis-
sion. Tax-raising is left to the voters, 

whom without incentive might be 
disenfranchised in a weak economy. 
Therefore, it may have been neces-
sary for Brown to use an ultimatum 
to get the necessary votes to pass the 
measure. 

Congratulations, Gov. Brown. It 
took a major campaign of bullying 
state university and community 
college into supporting your plan to 
balance the budget. In hindsight, it 
worked and at long last the Cali-
fornia budget is balanced, but state 
government will not always be able 
to gamble with tuition dollars. When 
the electorate decides to stop playing 
the governor’s games, the students 
will pay the price.

Dear Editor,
In reference to your “vote yes 

on Proposition 30” in opinion. You 
state, “The difference is minimal.” 
Are you kidding? Please refer to 
the lead editorial in today’s Wall 
Street Journal page A16. Usually 
the WSJ does not offer opinions on 
any state propositions, but since 
Proposition 30 is such a potential 
disaster for California, they made 
an exception today. I hope you all 
CAREFULLY read what the journal 
has written about it, so you can 
understand the facts. The WSJ is 
the most respected business paper 
in the USA.  

If Proposition 30 passes, 
someone who makes a $1 million 
a year will have to pay $133,000 
(13.3 percent) for the “privilege” of 
living in California — that is on top 
of the federal taxes. Believe me, no 
one will be coming to California 
to start business; it would be much 
cheaper (and easier) in Arizona or 
Nevada. Also, many millionaires, 
their businesses and their money 
will move out. Please see Illinois 
and Michigan.  

As the journal states, one in 
five Californians is out of work or 
working part time because they 
can’t find full time work, and you 
want to make it more difficult for 
current employers or potential 
employers? The journal called 
Proposition 30 “insanity.” Please 
read it.

Dear Editor,
“Fighting Bob” Filner is the right 

choice for Mayor of San Diego. 
And Bob has a right to trace his 
political lineage to Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Qualcomm started the 
current fiscal year with a bang, 
reporting $4.68-billion revenue 
with $1.4-billion in profits, but one 
thing mentioned in the Qualcomm 
report was troubling. It turns out 
that the United States Attorney’s 
Office and the Department of 
Justice has initiated an investigation 
regarding compliance with the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

Will the regulators find enough 
to launch an official indictment? 
It’s too early to tell. But that’s 
precisely the sort of thing Laura 
Duffy ought to be most concerned 
with, despite the elevated decorum 
(or the lacking decorum) of recent 
political outings. For example, 
the fundraiser held at Irwin Jacob’s 
La Jolla house. “Fighting Bob” Filner 
is the right choice for mayor of San 
Diego. And Bob has a right to trace 
his political lineage to Martin Luther 
King, Jr. He’s the real deal!

New Tritons Show Promise 
Against Strong Opposing Teams

In front of possibly the largest 
crowd UCSD has ever played in 
front of for an exhibition game, the 
Tritons tipped off against SDSU — 
last season’s Division I Mountain 
West champion — this Monday, 
Nov. 5. 

Serving as a warm-up for the 
preseason, SDSU took the 80–56 win 
— not an overwhelming margin for 
a 2011 “sweet 16” team. The Tritons 
faced the Aztecs on the heels of the 
CCAA preseason coaches’ poll, in 
which UCSD was picked to finish 
11th in a 12-team conference.

“I don’t really pay a lot of atten-
tion to that,” UCSD Head Coach 
Chris Carlson said. “Obviously it’s 
more important how you finish, and 
our goal is to make the postseason.”

At the start, Carlson sent out the 
five men who will likely serve as the 
starters for the duration of the sea-
son to meet SDSU. The Aztecs took 
advantage of a Triton squad that was 
clearly on its heels to take an 11–3 
lead within the first four minutes. 
UCSD stemmed the bleeding with 
contributions from junior guards 
James McCann and MacKenzie 
McCullough coming off the bench.

Triton guards, senior Tyler 
McGrath, McCann and, alternately 
junior Matt Bailey and McCullough, 
matched up surprisingly well with 

the Aztec backcourt. UCSD needed 
to produce from the perimeter to 
stay close, as starting guards senior 
Justin Brue and sophomore Brandon 
Blanchard went 1-9 and 2-9, respec-
tively, on the night. The only Triton 
forward to post respectable numbers 
was freshman Drew Dyer, who went 
4-6 in field goal shooting, including 
3-4 from behind the arc.

“Our shooting is going to 
improve,” Carlson said. “I think we 
took some good shots, and I think 
typically we’re not going to get 1-for-
9 from Justin Brue.”

Although the frontcourt was 
unable to produce, UCSD — eighth 
in the conference for rebounds last 
season — showed markedly well on 
the boards. The Tritons ended the 
night with 33 rebounds to SDSU’s 
35. Improvement on the boards, a 
clear gap in UCSD’s game last sea-
son, is sure to help UCSD in the 
CCAA, and a number of the Triton 
newcomers had promising games. 
Along with Dyer, UCSD’s top scorer 
of the night, freshman forward Zach 
McMillan seems a solid addition.

“The one thing about this group 
is the effort has been there through-
out,” Carlson said. “If we can work 
on our execution, I think we’re really 
going to be in good shape.”

The Tritons’ first preseason 
match is scheduled for this Friday, 
Nov. 9 against Dixie State College of 
Utah at the Dixie State Classic.

“We have a very challenging 
schedule,” Carlson said. “Dixie State 
is a difficult team to play against, 
and it’s going to be tough because 
they’re a pretty talented group.”

UCSD begins conference play on 
Nov. 24 against CSU San Bernardino 
on the road.

Tritons Begin Season at SDSU Exhibition Tritons Advance to Regional
The tournament’s northwest rep-

resentative, Seattle Pacific, holds 
something of a monopoly over its 
conference, the GNAC. Entering 
Division II just one year after UCSD 
did in 2000, the Falcons have won 
the conference title eight times and 
have only recorded 33 losses. 

Seattle Pacific was the tourna-
ment runner-up in 2005 and the 
tournament champion in 2008, 
when it defeated the Tritons in 
Regional play to advance to the 
Final Four. The Falcons have since 
failed to break out of the West 
Region, as Seattle Pacific lost to Cal 
State Los Angeles last season in the 
second round.  

“We’ll be watching the games this 
Thursday, and from there I think 
we’ll start planning,” Hernandez 
said. “We’ll talk later about posi-
tioning, who’s dangerous, how to 
maximize our players and hopefully 
how to come out on top.”

UCSD is in search of its third 
national championship. In an 

unprecedented showing, the Tritons 
won back-to-back national titles in 
their first seasons at the Division 
II level. 

Since 2002, though, the only 
time the Tritons have been able to 
advance to the Final Four was in 
2010, when UCSD was shut out 4–0 
to Grand Valley State. The Tritons 
have five starters from 2010 on their 
roster, as well as a number of under-
classmen who have proven their 
worth on the pitch. 

“I’m very excited to be playing 
at home,” Hernandez said. “We usu-
ally get a lot of good support during 
playoffs. Hopefully the right envi-
ronment and right atmosphere will 
help us out this weekend.”

UCSD’s first game will be this 
Saturday, Nov. 10 at 9 p.m. First-
seeded Sonoma State will play its 
second-round match on Sunday, Nov. 
11 against the winner between CCAA 
member No. 4 Cal Poly Pomona and 
No. 5 Western Washington.

16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

A last-minute equalizer, a penalty-kick upset and the Tritons’ first conference title in three seasons have propelled UCSD to its 13th program appearance at the NCAA Division II West Regionals. 
The Tritons will be hosting the six-team Regional — a precursor to 

the Final Four held in Evans, Ga. — Nov. 8 —10. UCSD goes in with the 
second-seed, behind first-seed CCAA opponent Sonoma State, a team the 
Tritons overcame in the CCAA title match. The No. 3 seed goes to Seattle 
Pacific University, a member of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference, 
who will face sixth-seeded Brigham Young University-Hawaii today at 
Triton Soccer Stadium.

“Obviously we’d like to be first-seed, but I think it worked out for us,” 
UCSD senior forward captain Gabi Hernandez said. “It’s fine with us, 
though; we’d rather play two new teams outside of our conference.”

UCSD will take on the winner of the matchup between Seattle Pacific 
and BYU-Hawaii, two teams that have strong NCAA track records.

BYU-Hawaii’s inaugural season was back in 2006. Since then, the 
Seasiders have made two tournament appearances. The last time BYU-
Hawaii appeared on the national stage was in 2010, when it fell in the 
first-round to UCSD, in a close 1–0 loss.
