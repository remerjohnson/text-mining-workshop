Report on res tructing 
administration released 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Associate News Editor 

A report advising Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson on 
po sible changes in the 
administrative structure 
here was released here 
yesterday, suggesti ng 
redefinition of areas of 
responsibility for campus 
student affairs and academic 
affairs offices. 

The report stems from a 
committee investigation of 
the possibility of re-
alignment of the responsibili-
ties of the Vice Chancellors 
for Student Affairs and 
Academic Affairs . The 
investigation was deemed 
necessary by Atkinson as 
both positions will be open 
soon. 

The Chancellor does not 
plan to comment on the 
report until he has 
con idered input he ha 
solicited from campus 
administrator, faculty and 
student groups. 

"This report will definitely 
generate a sub ta ntial 
amount of comment," said 
Assi tant Chancellor Patrick 
Ledden yesterda y. "The 
committee ha been very 
thorough and has pre, ented 
four possible reorganization-
al structure , all of which 
have strength and weaknes-
ses." 

Ledden added that "the 
Chancellor may come up 
with his own proposal after 
reading the committee' 
findings," rather than choose 

one created by the comittee. 
The four organizational 

structure outlined for the 
two offices range from the 
stat us quo, which orne 
committee members feel may 
be adequate, to a structure 
reflecting the mo t exten ive 
hitt in responsibilities. The 

proposals are accompanied 
by comments for and against 
each model. 

Four basic areas were 
considered by the committee 
for transfer of responsibility: 
academic services, which 
include the admissions and 
registrar's offices, recruit-
ment and retention; housing 
and food ervice; University 
Events; and University 
Extension and summer 
e s ion. 
Ledden believes the 

admissions and registrar's 
office, recruitment and 
retention and the "direction 
the Student Affair Office 
s hould take" are the mo t 
important things which are 
in need of change. 

"I really don 't think having 
housing and food ervices 
where it i under Larry 
Barrett (Manager of Auxilary 
Enterprises) i a major 
problem," aid Ledden, 
adding that he did not 
"think moving tho e service 
to student affair would 
improve the quality of 
student life." 

"I do feel strongly about 
t he proposed move of 
admissions and registrar to 
student affair," Ledden 

continued . "Both of those 
area mu t be in an academic 
office ("they are currently 
under the au picie of the 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs.) 

"Admis ions is a function 
of the faculty and is 
interacting with the faculty 
all the time concerning 
matters like transcripts, 
records and classroom size," 
he said. 

Ledden feels that having 
those two units "any other 
place would be a mistake, 
unless of course we could get 
a Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs with an extensive 
background as an academic-
. " Ian. 

While the committee's 
report inel u des three 
proposals that would move 
OASIS from academic to 
tudent affairs, where the 

program originated "in 
re ponse to tudents' 
perception of their own 
need s," Ledden believe 
OASIS Hi an academic 
matter" which s hould 
remain under academic

Herhenar wins layoff legal battle 

Maryann Herbenar 

I ndemnified for everything short of 
reinstatement to post in chancellor's office 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
When Assistant to the Chancellor Maryann 

Herbenar received notice of her layoff last 
spring, it seemed unlikely that her protests 
would receive little more than cursory 
attention. 

But after more than six months of legal 
negotiations with university officials, the 12-
year UCSD employee, now assistant to the 
director of busine s services, ha been 
indemnified for everything short of 
reinstatement for her former position in the 
chancellor's office. 

And now that her grievance battles have 
ended, Herbenar says she will try to put the 
last few months behind her and "lead a normal 
life." 

Herbenar 's quiet 'ettlement with the 
university, reached just over a week ago, 
absolves the univer ity of her claim that he 
had been laid off la t May with undue proce s 
and under exually di criminating condition . 

The terms of the 'Jgreement include an 
undi closed but " ubstantial" amount of 
money, reinstatement to her former job 
cla ification and salary, a even and a half 
percent merit il1crea e, guarant that her 
position i a full -time staff job, purging of the 
layoff from her employment record, ni rity 
in her job cia ification and tim off for work-
related training. 

Herbenar received formal notic of h r 
layoff ariy la t Ma when th n- han 110r 
William McElroy reque, ted t rmination of 
Herbenar' position, iting "lack of work. " 

Claiming that her work was necessary, -
and in fact, two administrators with similar 
job titles were brought into the chancellor's 
office this summer - Herbenar char~ed that 
her layoff stemmed from sex discrimmation. 

Herbenar was the only woman with an 
administrative job in the chancel1or's office at 
the time of her layoff. 

Rather than accept her layoff quietly , 
Herbenar hired an attorney and filed a 
grievance with the university in a challenge to 
what Chancel10r Atkin on ay wa part of 
the reorganization of hi taff. 

Although the grievance wa filed again t

and agreed to settle after everal month of

---~m----------------------------------------------------------
Denial of tenure for Tolbert IS • 

Editor: 
Once again the Guardian's 

sensationalist tactless style 
of journalism has undenni-
ned leEitimate student 
efforts. This is in reference to 
the article, (The Daily 
GlUlTd;"J', Nov. 22). "BSU 
crowd prompts AS support of 
Tolbert." 

Even the title is mislead· 
. iog. Not only were black 
students there, but Chicano, 
Asian and white students 
were also involved. Why did 
the GfUJrdio" fail to mention 
this? In addition to this, the 
GlUlrdia" projected the AS 
decision as one whicbgives 
the Black Students Union 
support in our. quest to get 
Dr. Tolbert tenure_ This is 
mi.leading. What the 
unanimous vote meant was 
that the AS of UCSD fully 
and unequivocally demand 

- that Professor Emory 
Tolbert be given tenure and 
nothirw short of that! 

Some mysterious charac-
ter named "Hill," who was 
supposed to be speaking on 
behalf of Tolbert, popped up 
in the article twice. The 
strange thing was that there 
was nobody named "Hill" 
even at the AS meeting. Is the 
G""rdia" really serious 
about reporting student 

concerns? I would su~t 
that the Guardian stop trymg 
to follow in the tradition of 
the San Diego Union and try 
to report more than surface· 
level details that will always 
mislead, and get a lIttle more 
in depth, a little more 
credible. 

Allow me to explain some 
of the real facts behind the 

. issue. Professor Emory 
Tol bert of the History 
Department and the Third 
World ' Studies program is 
commg up for tenure in 
December. He teaches Third 
World Studies 7 A, African-
American History 159A·B, 
and a colloquium on Marcus 
Garvey 159Q. Tolbert, who is 
an authority on Marcus 
Garvey, recently published a 
book about the Garveyist 
movement. 

Two years ago, Professor 
Tolbert came up for tenure 
review before the History 
department and was given a 
"no" recommendation. He 
was Biven a two·year 
extension by the administra-
tion, with a main reason 
being the student support he 
received. Students wrote 
letters in support of Tolbert, 
which the BSU is asking 
students to do now, and this 

·.-.IIIIIlIIl ... (~ i!. 
(om§ltm STRJ<IN' 11M( 

had a big. impact on the 
decision. Now, the funny 
thing about him not receiving 
tenure is that he has 
consistentlx received 
"outstanding' marks in 
teaching and ' community 
service. His scholarship and 
research, which the Depart-
ment deemed "inadequate," 
have been highly regarded by 
experts in the field of African-
American history and the 
Marcus Garvey Movement. 
Let it also be noted that the 
History Department has no 
scholars who are Qualified to 
judge Dr. Tolbert's work. 
There is no legitimate reason 
why the History Department 
should not give him tenure. 

Another underlying fact in 
this matter is the . impor· 
tance of giving African-
American History perman-
ence at this university. Black 
people have a long-standing 
history which is written in 
blood, battle and pain. It 
must be permanent at this 
university and must even be 
expanded upon, not taken 
away from. This is important 
not only for black students, 
but for any conscious person 
seeking to study the truth of 
history. If Tolbert is deniea, 
there is not another qualified 

---
-(if 

an anti- Black move 
black professor in this 
institituion that can teach 
African·American history. 
And yes, it is necessary to 
have a black professor 
teaching this subject. ai 
anything else would be a 
contradiction. How is 
someone supposed to teach 

something he has not 
experienced? 

Ultimately, the denial of 
tenure for Dr. Tolbert would 
represent an all·out attack on 
black people by this 
university. Let me remind 
y_ou, this is nothing new:

Wh?t amphitheatre? 
Editor: 

I believe that our present 
AS government is hypocriti· 
cal on their stands on issues. 
Last year, Carlos Montalvo 
pushed for the establishment 
and construction of an 
amphitheatre on campus. He 
met opposition from Central 
Library due to its planned 
placement below the library. 
He worked then for finding 
an alternative spot. He found 
an alternative spot someplace 
east of Interstate 5. How was 
he to know that this site was 
close to the UCSD chemical 
dump? This did not stop 
Carlos, however. 

Then his reign in the 
administration ended, and a 
new president took over. He 
soon resigned. Then a new 
president shelves the 
amphitheatre plans for a 
student center hall. This hall 
will hold 1,000-1,500 for 
concerts, movies, lectures 
and other special events. The 
most important special event 
it will serve will be that of 
parties . Yes, due to 
Irresponsibility in the past, 
organizations have no 
campus building in which 
they can throw a major party. 
Does this represent the 
students wishes? 

The amphitheatre would 
have assured major concerts 
at UCSD. The amphitheatre 
represented hard work of a 
president dedi.cated to the 
wishes of the student body. 
The current administration 
represents the interests of 
students organizations who 
are self·centered. 

Does the current AS 
student government repre-
sent the interests of the 

students? Don't you want to 
see the amphitheatre built? 
Places exist where there can 
be lectures and movies 
already. The only thing the 
new student center provides 
is a party hall. Can any 
student just throw a party in 
this new hall? I don't know, 
but you'll have to ask the 
administration that's 
working for you. 

Save the amphitheatre! 
. Steve Rosoff 

A 'trashy' 
letter 
Editor 

Whether the printing of the 
letter, "Unite For Orgasm" 
(The Daily Guardian, Nov. 
12), was bad edi torial 
judgement or not is of no 
concern to me; I found the 
letter to be quite humorous . 
However, I feel that I must 
make clear my feelings about 
the printing of one of the 
responses to that letter. In 
particular, the response that 
came from Francisco Villa III. 

Villas' letter is full of 
contr<\dictions, ilIegitamate 
syllogisms and illogical 
statements. Whether Villa's 
let ter is a'· hoax or a 
completely absurd collection 
of ideas is of no consequence. 
The fact is that you, the 
editors of The Daily

what your readers see in the

Blockading post offices-one way to avoid draft I 
BY EDWARD WILLIAMS 

I've been emphasizing a three-point 
strategy to destroy draft registration. 
The first point was the demand for 
opening up the university - its legal 
and counseling services - to the 
community. (Daily Guardian, Oct. 
29). Mass civil disobedience is the 
second point. 

Before getting into a discussion on 
civil disobedience, the term needs a 
definition. Civil disobedience (CD for 
short) means breaking the law with 
the willingness to take on the full legal 
and social consequences for the 

. action. This is all that CD means, and 
there is nothing in this definition 
which requires that CD be non·violent 
and passive. In the first anti-nuclear 
occupations of Seabrook, NH, the 
participants sat down on the site and 
went limp when police attempted to 
move them . This was civil 
disobedience. In more recent attempts 
to occupy the construction site of the 
Seabrook nuke, activists were 
confronted with chain link fences 
around the grounds. They chose to 
attack the fences with grappling 
hooks and bolt cutters to pull them 
down in the faceofthepoliceguarding 
them, and this was civil disobedience. 
If people decide that they only way to 

top nukes i by blowing up nuke si te 
and AEC office - if they do this and 
wait for the poli e to arrest them th~n 

the law and accepting the 
consequences of that act. 

So CD does not necessarily mean 
non· violence, and this is a good thing 
because the debates around non · 
violence are endless. Given a sit-in or 
blockade, some people think that 
anything more than going limp when 
confronted by the police is not non-
violence. Others allow for a measure 
of resistance to being dragged away-
linking arms, group solidarity and the 
like - within the framework of non· 
violence. But the great debate, the one 
that has split the anti-nuke movement 
back east, is whether destroying 
property is non -violent. The 
Clamshell Alliance insists that 
destroying fences around nuke sites is 
not non-violent, whereas Clams for 
Democracy and Coalition for Direct 
Action at Seabrook contend that it is. 
We will side-step this debate by 
stating that the non-violence is a 
tactical matter, while CD is a strategic 
matter. 

The distinction between strategy 
and tactics needs to be discussed. but 
first orne further asr.ects of CD will 
be con idered . Civtl Disobedience 
involves both direct and symbolic 
action. Direct action i when people 
act immediately and concretely to 
change something that affect them, 

uch as blockading the post offices to 
di rupt, even stop the draft 

by demonstrating the injustice of a 
situation they may not succeed in 
changing immediately. If done 
individually, CD tends toward 
symbolic action . If done by a mass of 
people, CD tends toward direct action. 

The strategic necessity for civil 
disobedience around draft registra-
tion has a direct and a symbolic 
component. Direct action against 
draft registration demonstrates that 
participants of draft age are serious 
about resistance, and that those not of 
draft age are serious about providing a 
community of support for resisters. If 
CD actions are large enough, they may 
even succeed in temporarily 
disrupting or shutting down the 
registration process. However, given 
the scope of the Selective Service 
System and the lack of time limits on 
the upcoming period of registration, 
CD will have an impact that is 
overwhelmingly symbolic. To the 
American people and government, it 
will demonstrate the determination of 
a resistance movement with historic 
links to the Vietnam resistance. yet 
one that ha learned from Vietnam. 
We've had different experiences and 
we have different potentials from the 
anti-war movement of the 60 as 
illustrated by (1) the current attempt 
to reinstitute conscription during 
peacetime, and (2) our potential with 

time registration for going 
the "save our as ," argument 

causes and intent of draft 
registration . Without the furor of war 
to polarize the issue, CD can be taken 
as part of the debate over draft 
registrat ion - a warning that say!" 
to the state, "this i, the first step, just 
wait until the draft is reinstituted or a 
war manufactured." 

San Diego Students for Peace were 
the catalysts in a successful blockade 
of the downtown post office on the 
first Friday of last summer's two 
weeks of draft registration. The 
Resistance Center of SDSP would like 
to organize for more blockades of po t 
offices on Jan. 5, when registration 
begins for 18-year-olds. Among the 
variety of tactics available under the 
strategy of Civil Disobedience - sit· 
ins, dramatic confrontations -
blockades would seem the most 
tactically correct in maximizing the 
strategic effectiveness of civil 
disobedience against draft 
registration. And, in the same light , 
non·violent resistance to the police 
would seem tactically correct in 
achieving both the direct and 
symbolic aspects of a CD strategy. So 
join San Diego Students for Peace and 
the Resistance Center ill blockading 
the post offices On January 5. We will 
be having civil di sobedience 
preparation workshops on Dec. 15 at 
the Che Cafe for UCSD, on Dec. 22 at 

cripp Cottage for SDSU, and onlan .

Quake death toll 
rises to over 1,000 

. NAPLES, Italy - The 
death toll in the earthquake 
that devastated southern 
Italy climbed to 1.012 
yesterday, officials said , and 
rescuers combed the rubble 
for more victim . 

A big rescue operation was 
under way to save people 
believed still buried under 
rubble from the Sunday 
night quake and to aid the 
several thousand people 
reported injured. 

Officials said rescuers had 
reported recoverjng ] ,012 
bodies, making it the highest 
earthquake death toll in Italy 
since 1930 when a quake in 
the same area claimed 1.400 
lives. 

"They scre.amed, oh did 
they scream. It was worse 
than hell ," said Angela Enza, 
who was trapped in a Belvano 
church when the killer 
earthquake struck during 

evening Mass. 
Searchers had found 59 

bodie - half of them 
children - and reported as 
many as 100 others mi sing 
jn the village of 2,200 people 
nestled in the hill 60 miles 
east of Naples. 

Rescue effort were 
hampered by damage to 
roads and rail lines and by 
aftershocks that hit every 30 
minutes throughout the 
night, often knocking down 
buildings damaged by the 
initial shock.

Herbenar's battle for jo~ 
takes her through legal battle 
continued from page 1 
embarrassed." . 

But Cynthia Starkovsky, labor/employee 
relations manager at UCSD and the 
university's legal representative in HerlJenar's 
w-ievance proceedings, says that Herllenar was 
'treated in a most fair and equitable manner in 
the resolution of her complaints." 

Starkovsky laughed at Herbenar 's charges 
that the universi ty tried to stall grievance 
proceedings, saying that Herbenar's case "was 
handled like any other grievance " and 
that univers ated . ith." 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
Herbenar says she encountered numberous 

obstacles to reaching final settlement. In her 
grievante, filed June 5, she de.n~and~d 
reinstatement to her former posltlon 10 
addition to settlement conditions that were 
reached in her recent contract. 

While she was never offered back her 
position in the chancellor's office, in which she 
had kept the chancellor's calendar and was 
defined as a "conduit" between the chancellor 
and the UCSD community, Herbenar was 
offered a temporary job sqon after she 
challenged her layoff. 

"This wasn 't even a position, " Herbenar 
claims. "The only job they had offered me was 
a three·month project under Laura Long 
(director of business ~ervices) to put together a 
manual." 

At the advice of her attorney, Herbenar 
turned down the offer and continued to 
demand reinstatement. 

Soon afterwards, Starkovsky met with 
Herbenar and Mele to negotiate a replacement 
job for Herbenar in accordance with university 
regulations, which state that laid off 
employees have preferential status to be 
offered another position of equal or lower 
classification and salary. 

"She (Starkovsky) started talking about 
making the project into a job," Mele says. 
"Then she started asking if any other kind of 
job were offered, would she (Herbenar) stay?" 

During these negotiation last spring, 
Herbenar sought job replacements at the . 
university on her own. According the Mele, 
administrators from the chancellor's office 
"were makin~ Maryann a hot item that no one 
would touch. ' 

with project s for her (Herbenar). Still, I think 
Maryann could' be called a liability to Laura." 

In addition to her attorney's assistance, 
Herbenar had the support and negotiating aid 
of UCSO's American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 
local. 

Herbenar - who until 1a t year had been a 
vocal critic of campus unions - originally had 
only divided sympathies from AFSCME 
members, who were skeptica l of the 
"manager" complaints, according to AFSCME 
representative Patsy Healey. But after 
reviewing the grievance, the union gave 
Herbenar their "full support ," Healey added. 

Herbenar and Mele say they had hoped that 
with the arrival of Chancellor Atkinson in July 
that "maybe reason would prevail" and the 
grievance could be settled quickly. 

But Atkinson, who does not take credit for 
Herbenar's layoff, stalled negotiations and 
changed hi s mind several times on whether or 
not Herbenar had been laid off improperly, 
according to Herbenar and Mele. 

In mid·August, they say, Stakovsky called to 
say " Atkin on had decided maybe some things 
were done wrong" and planned to write a letter 
to Herbenar in this vein. 

Just over a week later, Herbenar received 
Atkin on' letter, which stated , " .. .1 believe 
you have been treated in a fair and equitable 
manner ... " and urged re olution of Herbenar's 
grievance without formal proceedings. 

"Ii I'd been mad before, I wa furiou now, 
Herbenar says . _ 

Atkinsons he had believed throughout the 
proceeding that Herbenar "had legitimate 
complaints" and should be indemnified for her 
grievance. 

"I was really disgusted with the way the 
university handled the case," Atkin on ay of 
last spring's layoff. "I've said all along that I 
didn't think she was treated appropriately." 

Just how Herbenar's layoff was decided 
remains unclear. McElroy, who requested and 
gave formal notice of the layoff, has insisted 
that he acted at the request of Atkinson. 

But Atkinson ays he never called for 
Herbenar's layoff. 

During a brief visit to this campus last 
Atkinson says he talked with students. 

Former Chancellor William McElroy 
She cited as one exall.1ple Herbenar's job-

related discusisons with the Third College faculty and administrators regarding the 
Provost's Office, which were quickly structure of the chancellor's office.

The day after Herbenar filed grievance reorganize the chancellor's office," he says. 
against the university, she says she received a Atkinson admits he "did not anticipate

• H erbenar's battle leads concessions 
continued {rom page 4 

"The fact that a reorganization has 
occured in the chancellor's office is 
not at all unusual," she says.· .. That's 
simpl y a fact of life. The higher you 
move up the management structure, 

, the less job security you have," 
And if Herbenar's layoff was 

handled improperly, Starkovsky adds, 
"I strongly disagree that i right to 
consider Chancellor Atkinson 
responsible for problems that occured 
in the past." 

In October. Herbenar and Mele met 
with Atkinson 's - negotiators to di . 
cus the claim Herbenar would make 
at a formal hearing. "That was really, 
the fir t time they'd wanted to listen , ' 
Herbenar says . 

Within several days after this 
meeting Atkinson called for a 
reclassification of Herbenar's job 
status, removal of her layoff from 
personnel and employment records 
and serveral other conditions brough t 
out in the final settlement, Herbenar 
says. 

Still dissatisfied, Herbenar and 

Mele continued negotiations that 
were to lead to a formal hearing. But 
an offer of cash settlement finally 
brought proceedings to an informal 
close Nov. 14. 

As part of "release and ettlement," 
Herbenar's cash amount i being kept 
confident ial. 

However, Mele says the cash sum 
will cover Herbenar siegal expen e 
- which Herbenar estimates to be 
close to $9,000 - and "leave her a 
little change in her pocket." 

Atkinson say this amount is only 
one·sixth of the amount Herbenar 
first requested. 

Despite Herbenar's grievance 
settlement, she says it wi ll take some 
time before she can forget the past six 
month . "Several time I was very 
demoralized," she says. "It wa very, 
very hard," 

"I don't believe [ was treated with 
respect or dignity," she says, 
explaining that administrators from 
the chancellor's office tried to 
"discredit" her throughout the 
grievance proceeding. 

"They kept saying, "We've already 
given her what she deserves," Mele 
says. "And they aid she had only 
done the calendar (for McElroy), and 
said Maryann wa trying to make her 
job sound more important than it 
was." 

This complaint had also emerged 
last pring, when Herbenar, who had 
worked for McElroy for over eight 
years, received her layoff notice in the 
indentical format of a form layoff 
letter in the university's Policy and 
Prodedure Manual. 

Herbenar also claims that becau e 
she is a woman. her position was 
eliminated with "due process,r or 
cause. 

According to Herbenar, her layoff 
came as a complete surprise, both 
because her po ition was classified a 
"permanent" and because Atkin on, 
who visited UCSD briefly last spring, 
had commended her work during his 
stay here. 

Meanwhile, As istant Chancellor 
Pat Ledden. who e tenure in that 
position had been schedu led to expire 

during the summer, was retained in 
the cha ncellor 's office with a 
permanent status. 

Bruce Darling, special assistant to 
the chancellor, was brought in by 
Atkin on last spring to assist in the 
chancellor's office, and former UCSD 
development officer Pat Collum was 
awarded a one·year stint in the 
chancellor's office as a staff assistant. 

"That is unethical: r couldn't 
stomach it , I'm sorry," Herbenar says. 

Accordin& to Mele, the chancellor's 
office "didn t treat Maryann's case as 
a personnel matter, but as some kind 
of very emotional thing, trying to 
make Maryann feel guilty." 

Her grievance succes , however, 
destroys "the myth that women's 
work doesn 't mean anything," says 
AFSCME's Healey . "In my 
experiences with ~rievances, it's 
(Herbenar's victory) Just marvelous." 

Herbenar says her experiences with 
her layoff and grievance" how how 
management can forget about human 
being ,"

Turkey Olympics tomorrow 
BY LISA SULLIVAN . 

Tomorrow at noon the 
Turkey Olympics will be held 
on Revelle Plaza. Six live 
turkeys, each one sponsored 
by a different student 
organization, will compete in 
eight categories. 

Olympic organizers will 
not reveal the events but it is 
rumored that the pageantry 
will be judged upon 
intelligence , ph ysi que , 
strength, disco style, speed. 

loyalty and an inebriation 
test. 

The turkeys will be paired 
with trainers Wednesday 
morning when a local turkey 
owner tr.ansports them to 
UCSD. The teams will then 
have half an hour to practice 
before the Olympics begin. 
The turkey and its trainer 
will have matching indentifi-
cation items such as a name 
tag. hat, medallion, three· 
piece suit, or whatever they 

can come up with. 
Other contest rules 

prohibit bribery, abuse of 
turkeys, or use of timu lants 
in the turkey's body. 
Trainers must pledge to 
" love, honor and cherish" 
their turkey, and must al 0 
clean up after them. A final 
request is to "refrain from 
mentioning Thanksgiving to 
any turkey," lest it cau e 
them "extreme emotional 
Rtress". 

Iran wants a 'definite response' 
ALGIERS, Algeria AP 

- Iran has requested a 
further explanation of the US 
reply to Iran's conditions for 
t he release of the 52 
American hostages, informed 
sources in Algeria said 
yesterday. 

The sources said an 
Algerian delegation that 
delivered the US response to 
Iran returned from Tehran~ 
on Sunday and were to meet 
today with Algerian Foreign 
Minister Mohamed Benya-
hia. 

Iranian officials .said 
Sunday the US reply was 
unsatisfactory, and it wanted 
a "clear and explicit" yes or 
no, reports from Tehran say. 

It was not known if the 
Algerian delegation was 
planning to head to 
Washington. 

In Washington, State 
Department spokesman Joe 
Reap said the US government 
had received nothing official 
yet and was still in a "wait-
and-see attitude." He said 
there were no plans yet for 
anyone to go to Algiers to get 
the Iranian reply. 

Today is the hostages' 
388th in captivity since 
Islamic militants seized the 

US Embassy in Tehran and 
its staff on Nov. 4, 1979. 

The Algerians went to Iran 
Nov. 12 to deliver to US 
response to the four 
conditions. Algeria is 
representing Iran's interests 
in the United States. 

. The Iranian conditions are 
the release of more than $8 
billion in Iranian assets 
frozen by US presidential 
order to insure the payment 
of American claims against 
Iran, the cancellation of all 
such claims, a pledge of US 
non· interference in Iran, and 
return to Iran of the fortunes 
transferred abroad by the 
late Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi and his closest 
relatives. 

Deputy Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher went to 
the North African nation 
Nov. 10 to deliver the US 
reply. 

Secretary of State Edmund 
Muskie said last week that 
the United States,in its letter 
delivered in Tehran, accepted 
the Iranian conditions "in 
principle." But other US 
officials said the letter 
explained the legal obstacles 
that would have to be 
overcome in the courts before

three of the demands could be 
met. 

Iran's official reply was 
delivered Saturday in 
Tehran to the Algerians. 

Abdel Karim Gherayeb, 
leader of the four-member 
Algerian delegation, said at 
that time that he was taking 
the reply back to his country 
"and we will see what 
happens next. "

UCSD has systematically 
been decreasing the number 
of black faculty at this
