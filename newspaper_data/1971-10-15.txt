Despite Lack of Funds 
"Contemporary Issues' Alive and Well 

Morle MoJooleo 
Contemporary Issues at Muir 

College is alive and flourishing 
according to its director. Dr. 
Lola Schwartz. A1thou~h it was 
a topic of controversy last 
year. the format of the course 
is still evolving says Dr. 
Schwartz . Recalling the 
establishment of the course. 
she stated. "The first year I 
started this was the year in 
which the ecolo~y of mind in 
which the stu'dents were 
thrashing about. was anti-
structural. I had to convince 
the discussion leaders that 
there had to be some structure. 

if only that they might define 
their own anti-structural 
stance. " 

Workshop. given in the Spring 
quarter for the .. training" of 
new discussion leaders. Dr. 
Schwartz noted. "The latitude 
given the discussion leader 
does not include the freedom to 
not require a term pap r nor to 
turn them loose for most of the 
econd quarter to do their own 
thin~s . I regret that mv duty is 
t{) determine that some . own' 
thiDgS are not worth doing ... 

Commenting on the 

Situation in I reland Termed 
'Economic Conflict' by LR.A. 

The course. compul ory for 
Muir freshmen . consists of 
small directed-study groups 
working with selectively 
chosen discussion leaders 
under faculty supervision. and 
di sc ussing topics of 
contemporary concern . These 
are supervised by faculty 
members whose field of 
specialization qualifies them. 
There is also a series of 10-12 
lectures in this two-quarter 
course. the unifvin~ theme 

bein~ " The Idea of the 
niversity ... 
According to Dr. Schwartz. 

. 'Contemporary Issues has as 
its primarv goal that a student 
learn about how he learns : that 
he can. alone or with a group. 
learn to analyze. to research an 
issue and ' to present his 
researches and opinions in 
literate. articulate form to 
others : that he learn about 
primary and secondary ources 
and resources of library and 
community : that he learn how 
to marshall his own 
capabilities for problem 
definition and /or red finition 
and olution: that he develop 
an awareness of hi intellectual 
shell. .. 

successes of the program. Dr. 
Schwartz stated. ·· It seemed to 
those of us who read the e 
evaluations that both the 
upperclass discussion leaders 
and the freshmen felt the 
course had been j!ood. spanning 
the spectrum from beneficial 
to exciting. depending of 
course on the individual giving 
the evaluation . It was 
considered a welcome relief 
from lar~e classes where the 
instructor instructs and the 
chances for meaningful debate 
are at a minimum." 

Vicley Nyhan 
"The struggle by ordinary 

Irish people for their rights" 
was discussed by Sean Kenny. 
Irish Republican Army 
General Secretary. last 
Monday night. Kenny told an 
audience of 100 in the Revelle 
Cafeteria that the objective of 
the IRA is " to overthrow the 
British imperialists and 
esta blish a socialist 
government - the IRA is 
sowi ng· the seeds of 
revolution. " 
' Kenny is the , official 

representative of the Irish 
Republican Army in the U.S. 
and Canada. The IRA is active 
in all 37 counties of both 
Northern and Southern Ireland. 

Kennv described the IRA's 
struggle as " not a religious 
struggle : rather it is a class 
conflict involving the rich 
aga inst the poor." He asked for 
"unitv and justice for all of our 
people of our nation" so that 
the "killing and maiming of 
ordinary Irish people" may 

nd . Kennv said that the IRA is 
organIZIng to ex tend the 
truggle nationally . 

Concentration Camp Described 
Kennv told of a concentration 

camp outside Belfast. 'orthern 
Ireland. which holds 290 
political prisoners "without 
char~e or trial. There are an 
additional 15 political prisoners 
held in En~lish jails." he ·said. 
"The Irish people have been 
deprived of their rights to fi h 
in their own rivers. which are 
co ntrolled bv British 
imp rialists . Mines are also 
controlled b.v the imperialists. 
and IrIsh people are us d as 
slaves to work them ." 

The IRA demands that large 
esta tes which do not belong to 
the Iri h people be turned over 
to them for cooperative 
ownership. for. Kenn~' said. 
"The Irish people have been 
deprived of a roof over their 
head . In Dublin alone there 
are 10.000 people without 
adequate housing. re~ardless 
of their religion. Those who do 
have housing are forced to live 
in small apartments and are 
charged high rents b~' foreign 
peculator . There are 52.000 

ci tizens who have been 
depri\"ed of the right of a job ... 

In both ~orthern and 
outhern Ireland. Kenn\" stated 

"oppressive legislation has 
been used against 
revolutionaries. In the 1940·s. 
and again in 195i . 
concentration camps opened 
that were controlled b,· the 
Commonwea lth . of 
Westminster ." The IRA 
belie\'6 that the~' "must arm 

themselves in order to 
eliminate the enemy." The 
kind of freedom the'y desire 
would put "The actual people 
in charge of natural 
resources ." Kenny explained. 

Although the IRA has been 
banned. it has managed to 
survive in the open politically. 
According to Kenny. the real 
situation in Ireland has not 
been disclosed to Americans 
because news comes through 
AP and PI sources in 
England. 

Economic Struggle 
Kenny reiterated. "This is an 

economic struggle : God is not 
involved in that struggle. It is 
the same plight of any political 
prisoner in capitalism. It is for 
people who are interested in 
the ordinary people and have a 
hatred for imperialism. It IS a 
love for mankind : it is a 
healthy situation. " 

Kennv feels that the state of 
dffalr . in Ireland is an 
international struggle. The IRA 
asks for "solidaritv" and for 
Americans to "organize and 
win the U.S. revolution ." 

"England. coUand. and 
Wales are fighting the same 
svstem. ·· he said . " The 
revolutionaries must have guns 
in their hands because the rich 
are killing the poor ." The 
greatest danger seen by the 
IRA is Ireland 's entrv into the 
Common Market. Thev fore ee 
controller in Bru efs driving 
small farmers out. building 
ranches. buying up Jand. and 
tripling food price . 

For the IRA. this is just the 
beginning. At the moment. they 
are working on "detense 
against the tactics of the 
British soldiers. which are 
similar to those used in 
Vietnam . People are 
kidnapped. blind-folded. and 
thrown out of a helicopter four 
or five feet from the ground. 
British troops are attacking 
both Catholics and Prote tants. 
forcing an abortive revolution 
of the people." 

The IRA is im'olved also in 
"defendin~ the rights of mass 
education in the street ." They 
charge that British agents and 
misguided Protestants or 

atholics use sectarianism to 
divide the people. and the~' are 

" tr~' ing to eliminate ectarian 
feelings b~' teaching. showing. 
and involving." 

Catllolln Exeommullcated 
As Kennv described the 

situation in ·Ireland. "Catholic 
members of the IRA are being 
excommunicated b~' the 
Church. although prie ts and 
Protestant clergymen have 
s~'mpathized with the Irish 

In response to a question 
about who funds some of the 
special projects of the 
program. Dr. Schwartz replied. 
" What funds? " 

ample of Topics Given 

Republican movement for 
years. Irish people have been 
imprisoned without charge or 
fine. searched without a 
warrant. and curfews have 
been imposed. Arrested people 
have been forcibly detained 
and made to answer questions 
even if they are incriminating. 
If they refuse to answer. they 
are guilty of offense. A person 
is arrested if he uses false 
statements by word or bv 
mouth. The IR'A newspaper ha's 
been banned. and political 
propaganda sheets publishing 
IRA ideas have been banned." 

Kennv concluded. " Life of 
the revolutionarv is as bad in 
Ireland as it is anvwhere." 

Di cuss ion Leaders Trained 
Being a discu sion leader is 

the outgrowth of an upper 
divi ion cour e entitled the 
Contemporary Issues 

The following are a 
representative ample of the 
discussion leaders and the 
directed tudy ~roups they are 
leading : 

1. ChriS DeLaurier . 
.. y terns and Self" : designed 
to examine the Question 

The IRA is "concerned with 
international struggles. but 
feels it might b gin with the 
Irish struggle." It is working 
for .. olidarity". trying to "get 
their own countrv involved so 
that it mav be involved in the 
world struggle." 

Kenny has been an organizer 
for the Irish Repu blican 
Movement in England . 
Scotland. and Wales. and a full-
time organizer for the IRA -
Sinn Fein on the west and 
north-west coasts of Ireland 
and in Dublin. He was General 
Secretarv of the e!tic Youth 
Congress which represented 
nationalist viewpoints from 
vouth of Celtic nations. Before 
his speaking tour in the .S .. he 
was an executive member of 
the Dublin Housing Action 
Committee and served as 
!';ational oordinator of the 
National Waters Restoration 
League. He was al 0 a founding 
member and Chairman of the 
Irish Republican Prisoners 
Release Committee ?ond an 
executive member of the Iri h 
Anti-Ground Rent League. 

Have You Registered to Vote Yet? 
Eighteen-twenty-one-year-old are now 

eligible tQ vote . but not man~' 01 them have 
registered ~·e t. ,\ lack of understanding of how 
to exercise the right to vote seems to be the 
reason for this. Eligibilit~· for 18-21 year old is 
determined bv the same tandards and 
procedures that are applied to people over 21 : to 
register here. one must never have been 
convicted of a felon~' and declare San Diego 

Count~· their place of residence. 
Operation Frontlash has been e tabli hed in 

conjunction with the Labor Council 's 
Committee on Political Education I COPE I of 
the AFL-CIO. to trv to mobilize 18-25 vear-old 
voters. All last ' summer. ~'oung ' deput~· 
registrars have been registering the e people at 
concerts. colleges and high schools and 

unemplo~'ment ortices. Although Frontlash is 
not ~'et organized at UC D. ~'ou can still become 
a deput~· registrar b~' calling Steve Bieringer at

p~lge two 
McGovern to Address 
ZPG Group Tomorrow 

Senator George McGovern of South Dakota will arrive in San 
Diego today for a round of speeches in his effort to capture the 
Democratic Presidential nomination. 

McGovern. who is the first announced Democratic 
Presidential candidate. will arrive at San Diego International 
Airport today at 2 p.m. He will speak at a Jefferson-Jackson 
Day Dinner tonight in Coronado. The dinner. sponsored by the 
Democratic Party. will feature several Democratic hopefuls 
including Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty.Senators Fred Harris 
of Oklahoma. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. and Henry 
Jackson of Washington. 

Tomorrow morning. McGovern is scheduled to speak at the 
Stardust Motor hotel in Mission Valley. Following that address 
the Senator will speak to delegates at a Zero Population 
Growth Conference here at UCSD. That conference will be held 
in the ·second floor auditorium of the School of Medicine. 
McGovern is scheduled to speak at 11 a.m. 

The South Dakota Senator comes to Southern California on 
the heels of an announcement by Senator Birch Bavh that he is 
withdrawing from contention for the Democratic ·nomination. 
Bayh gave as !tis re~n the fact tltat his wife has just had an 
operation for cancer and will have a slow recovery. Bayh's 
withdrawal is generally felt to be helpful to McGovern since 
much of Bayh's liberal support will probably go to McGovern. 

Bavh and McGovern have been closely associated with 
liberal causes in Congress. McGovern has been a vocal 
opponent of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War. and his 
campaign was originally conceived as a challenge to the 
current U.S. POlicv in that area. 

McGovern's visit to Southern California is an attempt to 
bolster his support in this important primary state. Senator 
Edmund Muskie has a great deal of support from party 
regulars and McGovern must make a strong showing in the 
primaries if he is to be a viable candidate.

The Career Education 
Planning Services of UCSD 
has begun its series 01 
informative " rap" sessions 
regarding graduate 
opportunities and careers. 
According to Dr. George 
Burchill, head of CEPS, this 
year in addition to bringing 
in seminar leaders from 
traditional careers, they 
will be bringing in 
representatives of many of 
the new" life styles." 

With our current 
economic structure, we are 
finding for example, physics 
PhD's unable to find a 
decent job. As a result, we 
find a definite need in being 
flexible, along with the need 
for a creative career 
planning for students. The 
services offered by the 
Career Education Planning 
Services are to help the 
student gain the knowledge 
he needs to be flexible and 
informed about his fields of 
interest. 

Among the services 
offered is an information 
center located on the 6th 
floor of Muir 20, which has 
a room available for 
browsing that is set up with 
information regarding 
career employment and 
graduate schools. There is a 
dossier service for 
compiling letters of 
recommendation and 
information to help prepare 
a person for seeking a job. 
Also , career seminars on 
any imaginable career or 
life style are, or can be set 
up. For example, seminars 
held thus far include 
" Setting up a Commune. " 
" Pre Med/Pre Dental ," and

Money, Who 
Gets the Money? 

The trouble with problems which are put off is 
that they don't go away, they just get worse. At 
issue is the Communications Board's funds for this 
year. The Comm 'Board failed to allocate its funds 
to its respective beneficiaries (KSDT, the TRITON 
TIMES and the subsidiary journals CRAZY 
TIMES, DIMENSION and THIRD WORLD) by the 
end of 1970-71, so the problem remains and has 
intensified. 

In Tuesday'S issue, Eric Campbell of CRAZY 
TIMES explained his paper's funding needs for the 
coming year and alluded to what he sees as 
inequalities in funding between the t:R ITON 
TIMES and CRAZY TIMES under the Comm 
Board's proposed budget. Much of what he 
presented may be wrongly interpreted. 

The Comm Board's proposed budget includes 
approximately 524,000 for KSDT, $20,500 for the 
TRITON TIMES, Sl50 for the Comm Board's 
operational expenses and no funds for the 
subsidiary journals. However, some clarification 
of these figures is in order. The 524,000 for KSDT, 
more than a fourfold increase over last year's 
appropriation of 55,781, is to fund expansion to an 
FM station in 1972. This station theoretically will 
reach parts of the north county, La Jolla and Point 
Loma, but will not reach the Pacific Beach area. 
While the subsidiary journals are not being funded 
directly, the Comm Board will spend over Sl,400 to 
maintain a layout room and a photo darkroom for 
the use of these journals. 

The $20,500 for the TT is 52,000 less than is 
required to maintain the same level of publication 
as last year, with a 56,000 printing increase over 
last year. The TRITON TIMES, unlike KSDT or 
CRAZY TIMES which exist totally by subsidy, 
earns more than half of its revenue through 
advertising. 

Basically, Campbell equates CRAZY TIMES 
with the TRITON TIMES to support his arguments 
for funding. The TRITON TIMES is a regular 
newspaper. We furnish the campus and 
surrounding community with information 
concerning social, cultural, academic and news 
events upon which they depend. We furnish 
political news research and serve as a forum for 
opinions of all types, whereas CRAZY TIMES and 
DIMENSION are journals of political opinion: 

Campbell questioned the money allocated for 
TR ITON TIMES salaries. Publishing three issues 
last spring as CRAZY TIMES did is quite different 
from publishing regularly twice weekly. Those of 
us who receive salaries do so because we are 
performing a regular job. Many of us in editorial 
positions put in more than 40 hours a week on our 
jobs (averaging less than $.75 per hour). We 
simply do not have time to hold down another 
paying iob and be students as well. We wish 
Campbe,1 and the rest of the campus community 
would look at the salaries of the KSDT sta ff, And, 
These s;ll.ries are higher than those paid to our 
staff. 

Campbell questioned our expenditure for 
printing, and why we don't do our own paste·up,

demonstratively proud. with an 
open acceptance of Jewish 
dignity and honor . They lack 
any real Jewish knowledge but 
possess a profound yearning for 
it. These young people are true 
latter · day Maccabees. in their 
defiant resistance to spiritual 
attrition and cultura l 
impoverishment. 

The entire civilized world is 
long since fully aware of the 
profound violation of the basic 
human rights of the communitv 
of three and one half million 
Jews in the Soviet Union. The 
crux of this aching problem can 
be stated briefl~· . It is forcible 
assimilation . That phrase 
means two things. It means 
that a people is placed in the 
position of losing its cultural 
heritage and its historical 
group identity : And' it means 
thaI that process of attenuation 
is the result of a deliberate. 
official polic~' of force . 

In sum. the personality and 
character of the group is thus 
seen to be Violated. its future 

gravel~' jeopardized. These 
facts have been spelled out and 
deplored time and again b~' 
such human rights and peace 

Union. and they are justified. 
For the right to leave any 
country is absolutely funda· 
mental. intrinsic. irreducible 
and inalienable. [t is a right 
which the Soviet government 
itself recognizes. in theory. 

This is but the latest chapter 
in the age-<lld storY of the 
obdurate persistence of the 
Jews in the face of oppression 
by tyrants. How did it come 
about? What led to this revival 
of Jewish national feeling. this 
rise of Russian Zionism. after 
decades of enforced silence? 

This new expression of the 
Jewish will to survive occurs 
within a context of subdued but 
not insignificant ferment 
among a variety of other 
groups in the U.S.S. R. Small 
groups of Christian idealists 
resist the tyranny of the 
regime and the acqu'iescence of 
the Orthodox Church. There 
stirs a que st for the 
enhancement of national -
cultural rights of certain ethnic 
minorities. such as the dis· 
possessed Crimean Tatars. And 
a small but irreversible 
movement for civil liberties 
and free expression is being led 

b~' a hard~' band of the noblest 
spirits of the Soviet 
intelligensia . 

This ferment is in the air and 
there can hardly be a doubt

the machines they are now USing. But those 
machines are inadequate for the publication of 
eight to 12 pages twice a week. In order to do our

to lease newer machines which require money the 
Comm Board does not have. Until funding is

The Communications Board meets again on 
Monday. Hopefully a final decision will be made 
concerning the budget. '!Ie would like the Board, 
CRAZY TIMES and the rest of the campus to be 
aware of the consequences of the proposed 52,000 
or more slash in our budget. To make up this 
deficit, we will be forced to depend more upon 
advertising revenues. This means more ads per 
issue, less copy and less quality in the layouts; it 
means frustrated writers whose stories never get 
in because of space limitations; and it means less 
coverage of campus events also because of space 
limitations. The TRITON TIMES is here to serve 
the community. If our budget is cut, the 
community will pay the price.

But there are older and 
deeper causes as well - causes 
that might be termed both 
blessing and curse. 

The curse is Soviet Jewrv 's 
intimate and uninterrupted 
knowledge and experience of 
anti - semitism in this past 
quarter - century. Soviet Jews 
bear the indelible mark of the 
Holocaust. They are among its 
prime victims and survivors : 
more than a million Jews were 
slaughtered by the Nazis on 
territory that is part of the 
U.S.S.R. Scores of thousands 
of families survived in a 
shattered condition. In the 
U.S.S.R. today there are 
numerous parents. brothers. 
sisters. even husbands and 
wives. pleading to be reunited 
with their dearest ones in 
Israel. There are children who 
have waited in vain for years to

prospects of reunion with their 
families in Israel. 

The curse did not end with 
the Holocaust. There were the 
last five years of Stalin's life. 
1948-53. which Soviet Jews 
themselves called the .. Black 
Years" - when. as Svetlana 
Alliluyeva has now confirmed 
from' her own recollections. 
there was a widespread fear 
that Stalin planned to deport all 
Soviet Jews to Siberia. As it 
was. this was a period of anti -
Semitic purge and propaganda 
not only inside the U.S .S.R. but 
in much of the Soviet bloc. And 
even after Stalin 's death . the 
curse of anti - Semitism has 
persisted. in the suspicion. 
distrust and hostility with 
which the regime views the 
Jews. in the virulent "anti -
Zionist"' propaganda . in the 
systematic attempt to destroy 
Soviet Jewry's ties to the 
Jewish heritage and its 
historical bonds with world 
Jewry. 

Israel Creates Hope 
Bu t if the curse of anti -

Semitism has served to thrust 
Soviet Jews back in upon 
themselves. it is the blessing of 
Israel that has transformed 
negative frustration and 
resentment into creative 
ferment and posltive striving. 
It is extremely difficult for us 
who breathe the a Ir of freedom 
to grasp what Israel means for 
vast numbers who live in 
oppression . It transcends 
inspiration and approaches the 
messianic. Since its inception. 
Israe! has been a hope and a 
dream for masses of Soviet 

Jews. But it was the Six-Day 
War that transformed a wish 
into a source of pride and 
determination. 

Now " the time of fear has 
passed ; the hour of action has 
come." So write the heads of 
eighteen Georgian Jewish 
familes. and ' they bespeak the 
mood of all the other letter -
writers who proclaim their 
Jewish identity and kinship 
with I rael. and of the scores of 
thousands who have not vet 
found the audacity to dispatch 
open letters but who share the 
same ardent aspirations. 

Tens of thousands of Soyiet 
Jews have applied for exit 
permits to Israel. and the 
ranks of the darIng constantly 
grow . '0 amount of 
propaganda and pressure is 
likelv to undo this historic 
spiri'tual transformation.

Possibilities 

t 

- In a culture that has been threatened by its own mis· 
management and at the same time inundated with portents of 
this disaster . once relevant statements concerning man, the 
earth and ecology have lately turned prosaic. Politicians 
preach the reform that voters so dearly wish to see. and 
Madison Avenue has turned the mission of saving our planet 
into a money-making proposition. 

Amidst the corruption of a crucial issue. the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art has assembled works of four 
California artists deeply concerned with the land and man 's 
relationship to nature. EARTH : A IMAL, VEGETABLE. 
AND MINERAL. which opened Oct. 9 and runs through Dec. 4, 
studies four major aspects of the natural process. Each of the 
four artists. Guy Dill . Vija Celmins, Laddie John Dill and 
Newlon Harrison, explores his field from a fresh and unique 
viewpoint. 

Guy Oil\. a young and critically successful sculptor. using 
wood and cardboard has constructed four imposing pieces in 
the Main Gallery. investigating the challenge of balance. The 
blocks of wood and cardboard boxes are critically positioned 
for support without the aid of any devices to form smooth, fluid 

Los Angeles 
Film Exposition 

It seems tha t everywhere in 
the western world from Venice 
to Cannes to San Francisco to 
Tokyo. major cities are having 
film festivals . Ironically, 
Tinseltown(Los Angeles) , the 
heart of the film industry. has 
yet to have an event such as 
those showing~ that have made 
Cannes famous . However, 
from Nov. 4-14 Los Angeles will 
be the host to what might be 
the festival of the year - the 
Los Angeles Film Exposition.

and teachers (provided the 
tickets are purchased at the 
film departments of USC, 
UCLA, Cal Arts or the 
American Film Institute) who 
wish to set' all or part of the 
series. Regular tickets will be 
sold through Ticketron and 
other Los Angeles ticket 
agencies. 

These films, which will be 
screened at Hollywood 's most 
famous shrine, Grauman's 
Chinese (as well as at the LA 
County Art Museum). are most 
definitely worth the two-bour 
journey up to glitter city. You

additional information. 

designs. The heavy , awkward lumber, arranged precariously 
to suggest flowing lines, contrasts the clean walls of the room 
and the startling gesture of the sculpture to present a union of 
chaos and serenity. Because the pieces are critically balanced 
and easily jarred. the room is an adventure as it seems to defy 
gravity. 

Guy's brother , Laddie John Dill, explores the possibilities of 
minerals enhanced by lighting with his work in the Meyer 
Gallery. He has piled sand on the bare floor and placed panes of 
clear glass upright in the sand and illumined it from below by 

Ecological 
a strip of aragon tubing. The room presents a barren, wind-
swept desert. hostile to man, yet accepting the product man 
has taken from the earth. 

The glass seems to sprout naturally from the· sand and the 
subtle reflection of one pane against another produces an 
illusion of endlessness within the small room . Man has thus 
utilized the ~inerals to produce the glass . and still the sand 
supports and dominates his clever craft. 

Life-supporting water is stunningly portrayed in eight 
graphite drawings by Vij a Celmills of UC Irvine. Seeing onlv

Harrison simply reverts to the natural balance by providing a

EEEEE·YAH! 
Andy Estabrook 

Among the higher art forms 
found at UCSD. the field of 
martial arts is perhaps the 
purest expression of individual 
freedom . With the styles of 
karate. judo and aikido 'open to 
everyone at UCSD. personal 
expression manifests itself in 
the various aspects these 
disciplines offer to the 
individual. 

Karate. by far the most 
popular and most organized of 
the martial arts here, is open to 

students and faculty in the 
for m of P . E . classes 
(beginning . intermediate. and 
advanced I. These classes are 
being taught by 7th degree 
Black Belt and Chairman of the 
All America Karate Federation 
Hidetaka Nishivama . There 
are also extension courses. the 
karate club and the 
intercollegiate karate team . 
which is currently the 
defending national champion of 
the All-American Karate 
Federation . 

The intercollegiate team will 
be entered in the 1971 
Southwest Regional Karate 
Tournament. to be held 
Saturday. Nov . 6 at L.A. City 
College Gymnasium. The gym 
IS on ass North Vermont 
Avenue and the tournament 
will be quite interesting. The 
donation is $2 and tickets are 
available at the UCSD gym 
Tuesday and Thursday from'4-6 
p.m. Or, contact Paul Giotta at 
the language lab Tuesday or 
Thursday from 9-1 p.m. . 

The P.E. classes are offered 
every quarter and are arranged 
so that if one attends class 
regularly and expends a 
minimal amount of energy. he 
can usually count on advancing 
to a higher kyu (level ) each 
quarter. The degrees of 
proficiency are. of course. 
measured bv the different 
colored belts: ranging from the 
white belt to the heralded black 
belt. with three kyus making up 
the division between belts. 

For those of you who wish to 

become more deeplv involved 
with karate. or are more 
serious about it. there is the 
karate club and the 
intercollegiate team. Both 
groups extend an open 
welcome and invite you to 
contact Dr . Frankel 'of the 
Math Department in 2A 7456 or 
at exl. 2467. He can tell you just 
about anything and everything 
concerning karate at UCSD. 
besides being a super-nice guy. 

Although karate is mainly a 
method of defense against 
warranted physical assault. it 
offers much more than 
defense. For the arm·chair 
warriors. karate takes on its 
simplest form. that of being an 
interesting and fun way to 
exercise those rolls of fal. 
However. if vou examine the 
other end of the spectrum. you 
find the purist . To him karate

The Tritons have a problem. As against Riverside the 
previous week. the Tritons complet Iy dominated Wednesday 's 
soccer game. played almost the entire game in theIr 
opponents ' end of the field . and allow d onlv one shot on theIr 
goal In the second half. Yet despIte all of this. It took UCSD one 
whole game plus an overtime to def at Southern Cali forni a 
College 2-1. 

After three hard fought. but nonethele scoreless quarters. 
.sec got on the scoreboard first through a mIx-up between 
fullback Doug Smith and goalkeeper Robert Van Valin. ThiS 
seemed to Irk Smith. who promptlv cruIsed down the field and 
blasted in the tying goal for the Tritons . 

The Tritons then broke into an orgy of shooting. but it was 
fruitless . The final gun then sounded. and the dejected team 
shuffled off the field . Then the referees announced that two 
five-minute overtimes were to be pla yed. In the first set Carlos 
Robles headed a corner kick past the goalie fo r the winning 
goal. Then the Tritons knuckeled down and contained SCC until 
the gun misfired to end the match. 

This win put the Triton 's season record at 2·2. This Saturday 
UCSD will mount a foray into Orange County to face Chapman 
College. 

Runners Held Up 
Under somewhat 

controversial circumstances 
last Saturday. the Tritons came 
out in the middle in a tri·meet 
with Azusa-Pacific College and 
Chapman College. 

The Azusa harriers came out 
on top with the low score of 22. 
while UCSD followed with 33 
and Chapman was a distant last 
with a whopping 81. The storv 
might have come out different 
if San Diego 's number one 
runner . Ed Avo\. had not failed 
to finish the race. He felt the 
team was not allowed enough 
time to warm up properly in 
order to turn in a good 
performance.

normally requires at least a 
half hour warm-up period. 
which the Tritons were not 
given. in order to prevent 
cramps and reach top physical

UCSD. placing third over all. 
He was followed by Jerry King. 
Kirk Newell . Bob Holzinger. 
Chuck Crumly and Bob Perez.
