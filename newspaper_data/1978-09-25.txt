Third College Naming 
Held up by McElroy 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
AIIodate News EdAl. 

In a move Third College 
Provost Joseph Watson labels 
"inaultilll," Cbancellor Wil-
liam McElroy has beld up the 
pennanent namiDI of Third 
Colle,e for what will probably 
be several yean. 

McElroy's deci.ion was 
baaed on a J uly report by the 
Advl80ry Committee on Nam-
ing Streets, Buildings, Colleges 
and Facilities which iJ cbaired 
by Muir College Provost John 
Stewart. 

The committee ref)Ort, in 
recommending that the per-
manent naming of the college 
be beld in abeyance for several 
years, cited its belief that, 

"with the passage of time, the 
name would lose the sianifi; 
cance and emotional force that 
it now bas for many persons. It 
mi,ht even come to seem ill-
chosen." 

Watson's remark was made 
to a Third Colle,e Leadersbip 
Camp student group two weeks 
ago. Both Watson and the 
students expreued frustration 
over the issue, thought settled 
four months ago. 

Last May, students and staff 
at Tbird College voted over-
whelmingly in support of the 
name "Third" in an election 
conducted by mail. Shortly 
thereafter, the advisory com-
mittee recommended that the 
name be sent to the Regents 
(tbe final arbiter in any 
naming process) as the Uni-

malcontents" for upsetting 
Third's naming plans. 

Stewart argues, th(\ugh, that 
both the Third Colege vote and 
his committees's recom-
mendation were simply advi-
sory in nature, and that the 
final decision as to whether the 
name sbould be sent to the 
Regents lies with McElroy.

Watson told students at the 
Leadership Camp that be 
thought the Chancellor, who 
saw both the May and July 
reports, had a hand in the 
committee's change of heart, 
attributing McElroy's inter-
vention to several factors , 
including possible acceptance 
of tbe name by the Regents and 
question over the durability of 
the name. 

Stewart and McElroy main-
tain, however, that the Chan-
cellor did not intervene and 
that the advisory committee

Paraquat 
Up In 
Smoke

.u.elale Newt E .... 

A bill CO-'PODlOred by Sen-
ator Alan Cranston (D-CA) 
designed to stop Mexico from 
spraying its marijuana fields 
with paraquat .. sittiq on 
President Carter's desk , 
J adine Nielsen told The Guard-
ian from Cranston's Sacra-
mento office. 

Beer and Wine In the Cellar 

The bill , introduced by 
Senator Charles H. Percy (R-
IL) . was adopted unanimously 
by the U. S. Senate in late July 
as an amendment to tbe 
Foreign Assistance Act, ac-
cording to a press release from 
Cranston's office. The amend-
ment bans use of U. S. foreign 
aid funds for spraying mari-
juana fields with herbicides 
"that are likely to cause 
serious harm to the health of 
persons who may use or 
consume the sprayed mari-
juana." 

OpeniDJ up tb1a quarter in 
Bulldin, C of the Student 
Center is a nipt time coffee 
house called tbe "Cellar" 
whicb will feature Uve enter-
tainment on Saturday nilhtl 
and could be Joined next 
quarter by a pub &ervin, beer 
and wiDe, accordiDc to Gary 
Moser of the Student Center 
Board. 

The "Cellar" is designed to 
create an atmolpbere _ben 
students will be able to ,ather 
for .tudy brau and to meet 
and talk with friead8, MOHr 
said.

style cakes, teas and coffee. 

The Student Center Board 
will spend approximately 1l1OOO 
on a sta,e, lilbtl and a 80UDd 
sy.tem to build a "quality 
entertainment center" in 
buildiDJ C, MOler said. 

"The Cellar" will open Oct. 7 
and will feature tbe Juice 
Brothen Band and an as yet 
unapecified comedian from the 
Comedy Store in La Jolla. 
Admluion that Dilbt will be 
$1.00.

illl to Moser. 

Not only will there be a pub, 
said MOler, but the ~staurant 
in BulldiDJ C will have a "more

Moser said that the Student 
Center Board is currently 
opening biddinl for a pub and

MOler uJd, however, that 
tbe Student Center Board w 
not plannial to eliminate 
Future hodI from tile bicIdInI 

procell, only that the Board 
wanted a greater variety of 
food available at the res-
taurant. Future foods would be 
encoura,ed to enter a new bid 
if they could meet the new 
criteria for the Building C 
restaurant, he said. 

The idea of a pub in Building 
C is not a new one. Last year a 
proposal to set up a beer and 
wine facility in Building C ran 
into trouble with the Alcoholic 
Bevera,ea Commission on th 
question of a Ucense. 

Tbis year, accordin, to 
Moser, the pub will be able to 
follow the precedent set by San 
DielO State Univenity which 
Jut recently obtained a beer 
and wine Ucease. 

The U. S. Government has 
provided Mexico with $40 
million over the past three 
years for equipment and 
technical assistance to eradi-
cate poppies - from wbich 
heroin i. made - by spraying. 
But som )f the equipment has 
also been used to spray mari-
juana fields , according to 
Cranstoa. 

"It's the Mexican Govern-
ment'. own erratic pro,ram to 
spray the mariju fields 
with paraquat," Nielsen said.

Editor: 

I can understand that since

scope with state and national 
coverale of university-related 
iSBUes, a new name wu thOUlbt 
to be neceuary. Yet while the 
old name may be a little lilly, it 
il certainly not senile. To me, 
the name ne GurdIM takes 
itself too seriously, u if the 
newspaper W81 a stauncb and 
aJiIll self-appointed protecotr 
of mysterious precioua values 
that are somebow beinl threat-
ened. Wbatdoestbepaperbave 
to defend? The issue of objec-
tlve news coverale and free-
dom of the preas hal always 
existed and alwaYI will, so wby 
lhould one paper try to bral 
that it, especially, will be an 
outlet for tbe trutb? Otber 
newspapers named Tbe G.ard-

laD with whicb I am familiar 
seem to have definite political 
blasea that ,overn their news 
coverale, so the name cer-
tainly does DOt connote to me 
tbe open forum wbicb tbe 
"official" school newspaper 
should be. The tbiD& to be 
guarded II so obscure - II it the 
ltudentr! II the new.paper to 
play Ia Ieeo ,....1Is, too? Why 
can't the paper have a nice 
name that cIiItiquiIbeI it 81 
beloDlini to tbiI school, that 
Jive. it a pleaaaDt personality 
instead of elicltin, a dull 
,roan? 

AI a lOlli-time student at 
UCSD, I bave watcbed tbe 
Tri_ 1'bna chanie over the 
years. To bear of the name-
chaqe over the lWIlIDer with 
no wamiq II like leamiq that 
an old friend basluddeDly died. 
Since the newspaper belonp to 

the university community and 
not just the group of studeDts 
who run it for a few years, I 
tbink it is only fair tbat 
lUIIeltions for a new name be 
solicited from the whole com-
munity before a final decision II 
made. What II to preveDt eacb 
Dew executive board from 
tryiDg to cban,e tbe name

ODe tboroulbly confuled? I 
think the name-cbaDIedecilion 
wu too baatily tboqbt out willi 
uWe reeard to it. effect on 
everyone involved. If .tudents 
are so sbeepilh and apathetic 
about their scbool ima,e u to 
accept any name laid on their 
scbool paper, theD I guess they 
deserve and really Deed a 
GII8I'dJaD.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Sur-
prise pollce searebel of news-
rooma would be banned under a 
bill siJDed into law by Gov. Ed-
mund Brown Jr. Saturday. 

The measure was aimed at 
offsettinl a U. S. Supreme 
Court rutin, last May wbicb 
upbeld a surprise police search 
of the S&aDford Daily news-
room. Police were seetin, 
pbotoarapbs of demonstrators. 

The new law, wbicb was AB 
512 by Auemblyman Terry 
GoUin, D-San Bernardino, re-
quires pollce to obtain sub-
poena. for anytbiq they waDt 
in a new.room. It loes into 
effect Jan. 1. 

Police had a searcb warrant 
for the S&aldord Dally searcb, 
but a searcb warrant requires 
no notification of the OCCUpaDts. 
A .ubpoena requires notifica-
tion of the occupants of the 
place to be searched and it can 
be challeqed in court. 

GoUin said biI bili "limply 
permits a newspaper or news-
man to go to court and argue the 
case that wbat the police wish 
to obtain is privileged un-
der our law." 

At the court hearing, lawen-
forcement officials must say 
wbat they are looking for and 
establish its relevance to their 
crimiDal investigation . 

Goggin said the Supreme 
Court bad "invited state le,is-
latures to come up with proce-
dures wbereby sucb searcbes of 

Dewspapers could be regu-
lated." 

The measure was passed on 
the final day of the legislative 
session whicb ended Aug. 31. 
Goggin had amended the press 
searcb provi.lons into a bill to 
allow a woman prison inmate 
with a child under 2 years old to

Hospital. Students volunteer a 
minimum of four boun a week 
and spend ~ne bour a week 
participating in HELP's lec-
ture series. 

HELP be,an in 1976 as a 
result of the combiDed efforts 
of Career Plannln, and Place-
ment and the University 
Hospital Volunteer Office. Tbe 
hospital was lookinl for ways 
to do more for studenll. At the 
same time the career people on 
campus were lookin, for ways 
for students to belp orient their 
career ,oals. 

Accordin,' to one HELP 
student. "I thougbt I wanted to 
dedicate my life administerin, 
to people's needs as a doctor . 
Because of my voluDte.:r 
experience in the emergency 
room I know that is what I 
want. "

tion to the studenll baa been 
everything from favorable to 
extraordinary. The yeUow tee 
shirt, which si,nifies tbe

very welcome sl,bt in tbiI 
hospital. The students who 
wear tbe sbirt are usually 
smart and dedicated." Weiss-

man also iDdicated that baviq 
students iD tbe hospital so 
eller to learn actually atimu-
lates the staff. 

Since ums HELP's member-
ship baa more than doubled. 
One of the bopel both Wei88-

tbe life of tbe student." 

Weissman states. "but tbe

1927. the EI Cortez iI one of the 
oldeat bote .. iD SaD Dielo. "It 
was opened as an apartment 
hotel." aaid SUva. "it WaID't 
really a traDlient hotel. It only 
bad 135 rooma back then." 

The current owners - HaDd-

1951 and be,an expandln, and

pointed out. is the famous,iaaa 
elevator wbich travell tbe 
entire fourteen stories of tbe

Accordlq to SUva. "It was the 
flnt one in the world of aD 
outdoor-type ,lau elevator. It 
iI perba.,. our ,reatest claim 
to fame bere." The elevator ' 
was built in 1151 and is quite aD

Sliva, "the EI Cortez was &he

Tbe moat likely outcome of 
the next few weeks is that the 
EI Cortez Hotel will indeed 
cbange hands as well as 
purpose. According to Silva. 
Cerullo plans to use the 
bulldinl as a training center 
for ministers from all over the 
world. "But they 're not realJy 
teachinl them their creed so 
much as methods of teachInJ 
- audio-visual and otber 
means sucb as t.bia for better 
communication . In other 
words. they're taking people

anyone wbo considers them-
selves Christian. Tbey would 
not be tau,ht the ,ospel

but rather methods of teachInJ

Someday only memories will

demiCi come fint. UCSD atW 
I1l8IUlIt'I to maJDtaiD a v.ery 
sportsminded profile. The 
atmosphere on campus is 
buatIlq. At any time of day 
Muir field baa some aiJD of 
athletic activity. Tennis COUI"ta 
are rqularIy in UN. Jogera 
are prevalent on roads and 
paths tbroqbout the campus. 

Two forms of orlanized 
atbletic activity are available 
to studenh at UCSD-inter-
colleliate and intramural. The 
key to each, be it in competition 
alaJnat another univenity or 
in friendly rivalry alainat 
intencbool teams, is atudeot 
participation. 

UCSD fields more inter-
coUe8iate athletic teams (32 at 
Iaat count) thaD any other 
coUele or university in the 
nation. Teams ranle from 

fenciDI aad crew, to naJby and 
volleyball. 

DespIte amaIl budIeta the 
intercollellate teams from

INTRAMURALS 
UCSD's intramural philo-

sophy dictates that anyone who 
wanta to participate will bave 
an opportunity to play aU the 
time and not be a bench 
warmer. Skill levels and 
previous experience in the 
sport make DO difference in 
intramurals. Teams are 
matched by abillty with tbe 
lealUtl arr8DJed to meet tbe 
val'YiDllevela of competition. 

UDderaraduates, graduates 
or faculty/staff memben with 
recreation prtvilete carda are 
eUJibie to participate in any 
activity "ffereel by the Intra-
mural Sports ProIf8Jll. 

The be8t course of action to 
foUow is to decide wbleb sport 
you want to participate in, let 
loIetber with other students 
and form a team. Each team 
selects a captain or team 
representative. Tbia penon 
,otI to the team captaiD's 
meetiD& and finda out aU the 
neceaary detaila. 

If you do DOt have a team to 
play on, or if you are a few 
people abort or a fulIl'OIter, do 
not worry. Simply come to the 
team captains' meetiDI and 
tbiDp will be taken care of. 
Anyone who wants to play will 
play. 

Intramural Director, Mike 
Hipp, has a busy fall schedule 
planned for those studenh 
interested in participatiq in 
intramurala. 

Offered in the fall are flal 
football (men, women, and 
coed) , intertube waterpolo 
(coed) , volleyball (coed), floor 
hockey (coed), team teDDia 
(coed) and J.on-3 Baaketball 
(men, women) . 

Hipp also haa lOme special 
evem and tournaments slated 
for the fall quarter. In October

Races, Budweiser Supentan 
and Skateboard Competition.

French Intellectualism 
and Non-Sequiturs 

by Ted Burke 
Arts Editor 

Claude LeLupe, late of the 
French New Wave film makers 
school and now wasting what's 
leU of his reputation as a 
professor of vis ... al arts, lit 
another in an endless stream of 
cigarettes and pureed on it until 
his stoney Gallic features were 
wrapped in a blue grey haze. He 
looked at the auditorium full of 
students with an equally stoney 
gaze, looking at row after row 
with the detachment of a

orders for a systematic mass 
execution. Behind him;'ii targe 
movie screen was being low-
ered. He raised a microphone to 
his mouth and let loose witb a 
couple of fake cought; which 
boomed and echoed through the 
room like distant cannon fire 
and shocked the munnuring 
students into silence. LeLupe 
appraised the o$lds. Three 
hundred undergrads against 
one man-of-the-world . He 
flashed one of his habitual 
cryptic smiles, his lips stretch-
ing cheek to cheek like a rubber 
band being stretched between 
thumb and forefinger , and gave 
a gruff giggle. 

" Alright guys." he said, " I 
know most of you think this film 
class is going to be Wednesday 
Night a t the Movies, but forget 
it. Leave your pop corn and 
cheeseburgers at the door ... " 
The students were completely 
silent now , the la st mur-
murings having faded away 
like the white dot on a tUrned-
off television set as attention 
was rivetted to his accent, 
which struggled witb English 
words like a fly struggling with 
a spider web. " ... What you've 
signetl up for. in case you've

teach it as such. Tbat means 
I'm ,0iOl to show you films that 
are a lot harder to undentand 
and fit into an analytlcal 
framework than S&ar Wan, 
CIoR Eaeenaen, or any of the 

other mass market tripe slices 
you entertain yourselves with. 
The aim of this Cucking class is 
to teach you a whole new 
vocabulary when it comes to 
the cinema. These films and my 
lectures are going to go against 
every cliched, naive, stupid and 
unintelligent idea you 've ever 
had about film . Face it guys, 
you're all a bunch of ignorant 
slobs when it comes to film . You 
don' t even know who your home

I'm here, 'cause I know more

LeLupe coughed twice more 
into the mike , creating an 
explosion of smoke to burst 
from his sneering -lipped 
mouth . There was the sound of 
notebook pages rustling open . 
and pens clicking to record 
every pithy pea rl he spa t. 
LeLupe took a long, detennined 
fina l drag of( his cigarette, and 
then flicked it into the first row 
of students. The a uditorium a ir 
was filled with ccrebr Lil elec-

'" Laura Nyro: Fury ID Her Soul 
by Barry Alfonso 

Laura Nyro. you might 
remember, was the writer of 
"Stoney End", "And When I 
Die" , "EIi's Coming" and quite 
a few other bit SOBIS from the 
early '7Os. Though ..he venioos 
that sold millions were 
recorded by otben (Barbra 
Stl4l!isand. the Fifth Dimeosion. 
etc.), it was her personality 
that made these songs 10 
powerful. Nyro's view of life 
and love could be deeply tragic. 
wildly joyful or just plain crazy-
- it was always uniquely hers. 

If you haven't heard Nyro 
singing ber own works, you're 
missing a very special artist. 
After a hiatus of several years. 
she's recording albums again-

her latest , Nested , was 
released this summer. 

Nyro was the first woman 
siDler in rock to be taken 
seriously as a perfonner of her 
own material. She developed a 
IODJWriting style combining 
the Broadway ballad, rock and 
roll and free-fonn poetry that 
rivalled Bob Dylan·s. Her most 
introspective-aDd her best-
album is 1169's New York 
Tendaberry, a collection of 11 
intense. baunting songs . 
"Gibsom Street" from tbis 
album is typical of Nyro's 
moody. erotic lyrics: 

Dont't go to Gibsom. 
cross the river. 

The devil is hungry, 

the devil is sweet. 
If you are soft then 

you will shiver. 
They hang the alley 

cats on Gibsom Street. ... 
There is a man. be knows 

where I'm going. 
He ,ave me a strawberry 

to eat. 
I sucked its juices, 

never knowing 
These songs of good and evil, 

love and loneliness are brought 
to life by Nyro's rich 3 octave-
ran,e voice. She wails . 
whispers. literally screams her 
words over her stark piano 
playing. When she sings "I got 
fury in my soul" you absolutely 
believe her. 

New York Tendaberry was so 

emotionally extreme that 
anything she recorded 
afterwards would bave to have 
been gentier. Over the years 
she's definitely mellowed. Her 
new Nesled album is the work 
of a mature woman of 3I- and 
the music reflects it. 

I saw Nyro premiere many of 
these songs at the Roxy in Los 
Angeles last June. On stage she 
was subdued, but totally 
involved in her perfonnance. It 
was lOOn clea#that she wasn't 
going to scream and pound her 
piano to please ber old fans . 
Tbey would have to accept her 
as she was today- and they did. 
Her singing was as expretlSive 
as ever and her songs were the 
best she'd written in years. 

Danskin is Anywear. 
Parklane Hosiery is Everywhere. 

Nested's songs are about 
growing up and the searchfor 
stability . Much of it is 
nostalgic-"Rhythm And 
Blues" and "The Sweet Sky" 
recall the · r&b music she 
listened to as a girl in the 
Bronx. " My Innocence" deals 
with lost love, death and birth. 
There ' s a sense of self-
discovery in "The Nest" • a song 
about Nyro's coming mother-
hood. Despite all her changes. 
she's " still mixed-up like a 
t,eenal!er" _ 

If Nyro isn't as overpowering 
in her music as she once was, 
she is just as honest. Her 
sincerity keeps you listening. 
Like Dylan and Joni Mitchell, 
her albums are a chronicle of 
her life. 

ParkJane Hosiery has body hugging fashions that Il t you and 
your lift!style for class, classic or classy doings . Anywhere. 

And with 400 stores throughout America, Parklane Hosiery 
is the largest re tailer of Dan skl n leotards and tigb ts and Selva

French Intellectualism 
(Coat. from ,ale II) 
hammer. 'Why not go all the 
way' was what he said . What a 
sense of humor ... . " 

LeLupe badgered the stu-
dents some more by way of 
introducing what the class 
emphasis was going to be, a nd 
then segued into a lecture on 
film theory that was as compre-
hensible to the students as a bar 
of soap would be to a mud-
shark. 

" ... fiIm is at the cross roads 
of all mediums that came 
before it, the twentieth century 
juncture where all mediums 
and arts and ideas merge and 
become new by virtue of a 
weird dialectic functioning 
below the level of perception, 
but well enough inside existing 
frames of analysis to be 
subjected and dissected bit by 
bit until a new perception of 
ourselves emerges in a con-
sciousness that is aware of its 
own participation in theaesthe-
tic process. Even viewed in a 
Marxist context, film is not 
bound by history, but rather 
transcends barriers and be-
comes independent, a thing in 
itself that contains it elements 
apart of objects as they are 
used in a banal reality. Films 
are 'mechanisms , a physical 
alliteration of single frames 
that give the illusion of time , 
space, dimension , and con-
tained routines imbued with 
meaning and purpose . It's a'll 
propaganda , sublime to the 
nines and greased to educe the 
subconscious into a complacent 
attitude . Films construct 
perceptual filters that are 
changeable only by insanity, 
murder, rape, masterba tion ... 
any questions?" 

One hand rose amid the rows 
o[ lifeless bodies, a young man 
in glasses with a three day 
growth of beard thatlooked li~e 
a studied try at eccentnc 
shagginess. 

" So far" said the young man, 
" I have taken [our classes from 
you and have gotten A's in all 
of them, and as yet I haven't the 
slightest idea of what you're 
talking about. You have mas-
tered the art of academic triple-
talk even better than the 
sociology department. You 
give the air of being able to 
embrace paradoxical condi· , 
tions and ideas in a film th rough 

you ' re advanced style of 
cerebral circumlocution , but 
after going through the notes 
I've taken in past classes from 
you, I've come to the conclusion 
that you've nothing substantial 
to add to the body of film theory 
already extant. I might add 
that film theory as it is is one of 
the biggest hoaxes ever perpe-
trated on the American educa-
tional system, a quasi-disci· 
pline full of muddle headed 
mama's boys who got degrees 
by writing exorable tomes 
about thejr favorite pop culture 
manisfestation. In fact, film 
theory ranks behind rock 
criticism as the biggest psuedo-
intellectual endeavor one could 
embark upon. My point is that 
because I'm one of those lazy 
but bright boys Ii~e the kind 
who come to teach classes like 
this one, I've been able to bluff 
my way into A's without so 
much as getting eye strain . I 
didn't even see half the films 
you showed. So why don 't you 
just admit that you ' re just 
riding the crest of a good wave 
and knock off acting like you' ve 
got something to say th at 
everyone needs to know, no 
matter how much of your 
a rroga nce they have to sit 
through to get to it. ... .. 

The room was s ilent when the 
young man finished. LeLupe 
gave him a bla nk stare. The 
young man was hoping that 
LeLupe would react and that 
there would be some kind of a 
battle of the intellects , the 
student trying to best his old 
master. 

LeLupe reached under his 
desk , flipped open a ply 'wood 
panel , a nd came upon 'a board 
of buttons . He pressed one of 
them. A trap door opened under 
the students' seat, which he fell 
into . After several seconds 
came a sickening, anguished 
cry from the door opening . 
LeLupe merely smiled at the 
now empty seat. 

" So anyway," he continued , 
"tonight I'm going to treat you 
slimey middle class bastards 
to Emptiness Is a Nine Let-
ter Word by Ji.lcquc · Paul 
Godamn."
