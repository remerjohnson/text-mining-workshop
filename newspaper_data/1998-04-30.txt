Tucsday after running out of

About 10 fect from the bot-

Kcnnedy issued a statement. 
' 'I'm tired but feeling reall y 
good," he said . "All I can

RUMBLE 
Academic Senate votes} 31 to 12, 
for UCSD to move from Division 

III athletics to Division II 
By Leena Shankar 
Associate News Editor 

The Academic Scnate's Representative 
As cmbl y voted 31 to 12 to recommend that 
UCSD move from NCAA Division III to 
Di vision II athleti cs despi te the many objec-
ti ons ilnd questions ra ised by faculty at 
Tuesday mceting. 

The motion camc with stipulations that no 
athletic scholarships be offered, that no stu -
dents be admitted on the ba is of athletics and 
that no general funds be used 10 support 
Divi ion II intercollegiale athletics. 

Guardian editors cheer results. 
See editorial, page 4. 

Diana Marquardt, chair of the 
Intercollegiate and Rocreational Athletics 
Advisory Committee, said at the meeting that 
she felt that the committee had fu lly consid-
ered the issue. 

"This is not a change but a logical progres-
sion ba'iCd on the growth of UCSD," she said. 
"We are not really looking at things differently." 

Biology Professor Douglas Smith said he dis-
agreed and believes that UCSD should continue 
to focus more on academics than on athletics. 

"UCSD is primarily a high-standard academ-
ic institution," he said. "Division m has served 
UCSD well in the past and in the present." 

Many facult y mcmbers also ex pressed 
concern at the meeting over the financi al ram-
ifications of becoming a Division II school. 
Currently, UCSD spends approximately 
$500,000 on Di vision III athletics, but double 
to triple that amount may be needed to fund 
UCSD's athletics programs in Division n.

STUDENTS: President Diallo 
adjourns his last meeting with 
Leventhal waiting in the wings 
By Erika Snider 
Staff Writer 

The 1997-1998 A.S. Counci l called a close 
to its term last night during a meeting that fea-
tured parting speeches, laughter and a largely 
informal atmospherc. 

In its 30th and final meeti ng, thi s year's A.S. 
ouncil dealt with any remaining issues, such 

as final student-organi zation allocations and 
final amendments to council contracts and 
bylaws. The council also announced its final 
appointments with the naming of Muir 
Sophomore Senator Josh Caplan as the 1998-
1999 A.S. senale chair and Revelle Sophomore 
Senator Doc Khaleghi as the senate vice chair. 

A.S. Financial Controllcr Genoa Ferguson 
also named the members of thc Fall Quarter 
Student Organization Funding Advisory Board 
(SOFAB), which is the committee responsible 
for allocating AS. dollars to student organiza-
tions. 

The rest of the meeting, however, mostly 
featured the reminiscences and parting address-
es of many of the A.S. officers. Former AS. 
President Sou ley Diallo, who served on the 
council on and off since hi s freshman year, 
related hi s thoughts after four years of service. 

"This is my last council meeting, and thi s 
has definitely been the most dynamic, most 
exciting A.S. that I have seen," Diallo said. "I 
am honored to havc had the opportunity to be 
your AS. president." 

Diallo also reOected on how he believes thi s 
A.S. impacted UCSD this year. 

"We set the agenda in terms of what we 
thought the students wanted the campus to be 
like," he said. "We made sure that students' 
voices were heard. We shaped the AS. for the 
beUer." 

Fonner Vice President Internal David 
Fitzgerald shared Diallo 's attitude regarding the

Board Upholds Student-Employee Bargaining Rights 
LABOR: Students will 
choose union in an 
upcoming election 
By Ryan Olson 
Co-News E,ditor 

A three-member state labor 
board ruled on Friday that readers, 
tutors and teaching associates at 
UCSD are employees and are 
therefore eligible for collective bar-
gaining rights. 

The 2-I ruling of the Public 
Employment Relations Board 
(PERB) on an appeal of a 1994 rul-

ing by PERB Judge James Tam 
marks a victory for the ASSOCiation ' 
of Student Employees union affili -
ated with the United Auto Workers 
union (ASElUAW), which has been 
fighting for university recognition 
for years. 

"The decision shows that the 
PERB has once again said that stu-
dent employees have a right to col-
lective bargaining," said 
ASElUAW spokesman Anthony 
Navarrete. 'This is an assertion that 
we have had all along." 

UCSD has 20 days to respond to 
the ruling. If UCSD does 00( recog-

nize ASElUAW, an election will be 
held for the readers, tutors and 
teaching associates to choose their 
collective-bargaining representative. 

UCSD Labor Relations Director 
Michael Melman said that because 
the ruling comes so close to the end 
of the school year, it is likely that an 
election will take place next year. 

According to Navarrete, approx-
imately 500 -reader , tutor and 
teaching associates at UCSD are 
student academic employees. 

Teaching associates are different 
from leaching assistants (fAs) -
teaching usociaaes are responsible 

for the in truction of a course, where-
as teaching assistants aid professors. 

According to the ASfJUAW, the 
university has tried to use a 1984 
PERB case that ended in a ruling 
against TAs at UC Berkeley as a 
precedent against student employees 
gaining collective bargaining rights. 

In Friday's decision, the PERB 
board stated that it disagrees with 
the university 's argument. 

''The board' decision ... was 
based on condition and job duties 
existing on the UC 8ertteley cam-
pus in 1984," the judges wrote in

Former Ski Team Captain Dies In Accident 
OBITUARY: Ian Gini, 
26, was killed on an 
Alaskan ski trip 
By Julia Kull&-Mader 
Co-News Editor 

Ian Gini, a former UCSD ski 
team captain and coach, was killed 
Mon ., April 20, during an Alaskan 
ski trip after he plunged more than 
200 feet down a rocky slope. 

Gini, 26, was checking out a ski 
run with Ken Hudson, 33, when a 
snow cornice bro"e beneath them. 
Although Gini died of head and 
intemal injuries, Hudson only suf-
fered minor injuries and was 
released from the hospital the neKt 
day. 

f laving lived in San Francisco 
and wor"ed as a compuler pro-
grammer, Gini. planned to head to 
Brussels, Belgium for a new job 
after the 10-day Alasb trip. 

Gini was an avid traveler who 
had visited various places around 
the world including Africa. 
Thailand and Nepal. 

Darcy Bingham, assistant direc-
tor of recreational sports, worked 
with Gini when she was sports club 
director at UCSD and attended 
Gini's funeral in Boulder. Colo. 

"It was standing room only at 
the church, and everybody at the 
funeral kept on saying that he lead 
his life," Bingham said. " He did

Joseph Watson, vice chancellor 
of student affairs, said the money 
would indeed come from the real -
location of student fees and not an 
increase in student fees. 

"On a matter of finances, there 
is some ambiguity ... there is a cen-

Watson. "We would not raise the

"He raced on the alpine ski team

Current UCSD Ski Caplain 
Allison Cummings, a Rooseve lt

"He was the coach of the leam 
when I was a sophomore," she said. 
"He was just a really wonderful 

increase in students, so we wi II 
have an increase in regi stration fees

Faculty members, though, were 
not cenain that students understood 
that a move lO Division " might 
involve a decrease in the funding 
for other services or an increase in 
student fees. 

"One of our carly conclusions 
was lhat affiliation with Division 
1Il is inappropriate," said John 
Orcutt , chair of the Senate Pianning 
and Budget Commiltee. "We [cur-

about how much of a changing

The students have spoke n, and their voices have 
finally been heard. 

The Representative Assembly of the Academic 
Senate recommended Tuesday aftemoon that UCSD 
Athletics move to NCAA Divi sion II following a 
drawn-out, lengthy battle with the administration . 
The assembly cho~e to support the planned move, 
which would be effective starting with the 2000-0 I 
school year. 

1t is e xtreme ly di sconcerting, however, to see that 
many faculty members opposed, and still oppose this 
es ential move. There are many crit ica l reasons why 
the move to Divi sion II is a n inevitable consequence 
of UCSD 's growth . 

With over 15,000 students, UCSD is too big to be 
a Di vision III school. By comparing thi s population 
- the size of a small c ity - with some of UCSD's 
competition, it is indeed odd that our school still 
competes with schools that certainly have smaller tal -
ent pools - several of UCSD's competitors do not 
even have 1,000 students. 

Divi s ion II match ups will increase sc hool spirit 
and improve the soc ial scene on campus. Face it -
sports are a big part of college life. The magnitude 
of a move to Divi sion II will draw students to ath-
letic events by the truckload. Triton team s will 
finally be put into conferences with the likes of UC 
Davis, Cal Poly San Lui s Obispo, Sacramento State, 
USD and other natural rivals. Bigger athletic events 
translate inlo bigger student turnouls. Why would 
anyone be opposed to thi s? 

Ultimately, what the controversy finally comes 
down to is the question of who UCSD serves . In last 
spring's A.S. elections, 87 percent of the voters chose 
to make the move. So why is it still an issue a year 
later? The faculty have opposed the move from the 
beginning, claiming that il would compromise the 
academic integrity of this institution. But , who keeps 
the faculty in bus iness? 

A giant step in athletics frightens the faculty. 
UCSD was built on an academic foundation , with the 
stress going toward education . We, on the other hand, 
don't believe that larger athletic programs will dilute 
UCSD's academic excellence. NCAA Divi sion II 
athletes have a higher average OPA than UCSD stu-
dents . UCSD does not and will not offer athletic 
scholarships. Thus, the university can continue to set 
an excellent example in drawing scholar-athletes -
stude nts who are exceptional athle tes in addition to 
being exceptional students. 

Enter our supporti ve chancellor. Chancellor Dynes 
W<l~ in favor of the jump to D-Il from the beginning. Hi s 
voice was one Ihat echoed the sentiments, strongly and 
frequently, of the student representatives in Tuesday's 
decision. Without Dynes ' help, the move might have 
been turned down by the fac ulty once again. 

UC D is here ror the student s - the ones paying 
tuit ion , rememb!.!r? If :uch a huge amount of students 
vote ror a chang!.!, and it gets diluted in red tape, 
bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, d esn' t that make one 
wonder if the facu lty really cam ' aboutthl' \tudents' 
concerns and ne!.!ds? Don ' ttlley wish to fe!.!u our bod-
ies and souls and nol just o ur minds? 

'In the end, we be lieve that the move to Division II 
will benefi t UCSD in every way, and we applaud the 
Acade mic Senat e's Representati ve Assembly ror 
finally endorsing the move. At a school that keeps 

. improving itse lf every year, the . tudents have ear-
marked yet another way t make UC D a better 
place to get educated.

How TO SAVE TARNISHED 
LONG-DISTANCE FRIENDSHIPS 

COMMENTARY: Even if you have been the worst friend of the 20th century, 
never fear: here are some things you can do to salvage your broken friendships 

MEG A N 
K LEI N 

Reality Check 

Remember when you left home for 
your first year of college? If your last 
summer at home was anything like 
mine, you and your high school 
friends probably had a whole bunch of 
going-away parties as each person left, 
and you promised to write and call 
even though you knew you wouldn't 
follow through. 

Your freshman year you wrote and 
e-mailed at first, but eventually it 
faded off as months passed and you 
became more involved with the new 
people, places and things at university. 
By the next summer, you came home 
to a group of friends who had changed 
because of their new experiences: 
even though you and your friends were 
the same people you had always been, 
there was still something different. 

Then maybe the nex t year you grew 
a little more di,tant hecause you didn 't 
call them as much. You felt different 
about them; after all , they had changed 
a littll:. They were still your friends, 
but now you were a lot cio,cr to the 
peoplc you knew from college. Your 

Whatever happens, 
forgive your friends. 
Don't get hung up 
about stupid things 
like the fact they 
spent their only thre .. 
day weekend with 
their boyfriend's 
family Instead of 
visiting you. You know 
you would have done 
the same thing In their 
situation. Forgive 
them and move on.

slew of "injured" friendships and no 
rea l clue about how to fix them? 

Well , far be it from me to claim to 
be the perfect friend. [ have messed up 
my share of friendships (which should 
be obvious, considering that this col-
umn is autobiographical). But here is 
my advice on fixing slightly-tarnished, 
long-distance friendships: 
Say you're sorry. 

Everyone messes up at least once in 
every well-established friendship, but 
as long as you didn't do something 
drastic like steal their wallet or their 
car or their significant other, chances 
are they are going to forgive you . Send 
an ' 'I'm sorry I haven ' t written in the 
last three years" card and then forget 
about it. Real friends will forget as 
well, because your friendship means 
more to them than one stupid mistake. 

Whatever you do, though, don't 
bring up how sorry you are every time 
you see them (and don't use the excuse 
that you have been busy. Everyone is 
busy! That just doesn't work) . There is 
nothing more annoying than an over-
apologetic friend. Eventually you want 
to scream "Enough already!" and give 
them a big smack upside thc head 
(we ll , maybe that is overreacting a lit -
tle, but you get the idea). 

Once you have apologized, try not 
to make the same mistake again. It 
may seem obvious. and that 's a~ it 
shou ld be . Follow your common 
sense. If you really likc your friend" 
you don't want to hurt them over and 
over again . If you find yourself doing 
this, you mi ght want to -do them a 
favor and get some new friend. 
Take the Initiative. 

o n' t forget , you aren ' t the only 
human in your relati on~hip~. Most 
likely you probably aren't the only one 
to not have called in a few months, so

Thursday, April 30, t998 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

READ THE ARGUMENTS AND DECIDE FOR YOURS.ELVES 
Editor: 

After reading Jim Moore's cri-
tique of Michael Behc's arguments 
reiterated in an arti cle in the 
Guardian, I felt it was necessary to 
write a rebuttal to clear up some of 
the obfuscation. 

Moore accuses Luskin et 01 and 
Behe of making an argument from 
ignorance (argume1llLlm ad ignn-
rantil/lIl) . This fallacy occurs 
whenever it is argued that some-
thing must be true merely because 
it has not been proved false or vice 
ve rsa. 

An examp le of an argument 
from ignorance would be if I said, 
"Intelligent li fe must exist because 
no one can prove it docsn' t." Moore 
summarizes Behe 's argument, say-
ing, "I can' t imagine an intermedi-
ate, so it must nOl be there," and .... . 
ce ll s are too compl ex to be 
explained by evo lution ... " 
However, is Moore's crit ique accu-
rate and cogent? 

To answer this question, we 
need to consider the nature and 
limits of the argwllentllm ad ig1l0-
rantiLIII/ and Behe's arg uments as 
they are presented in Darwin's 
BLack Box. 

It should be noted, fi rst of all, 
that the argument from ignorance is 
not the same as assuming some-
thing is fa lse unt il it has been 
proven true. This is a basic tenet of 
scient ific methods. 

Also, in scientific investigation 
if it is known that an event would 
produce certain evidence of its hav-
ing occurred, then the absence of 
such evidence can validly be used 
to infer that the event did not occur. 
Belief in the event shou ld be sus-
pended until an explanati on is 
given (I am usi ng a Cliffordian 
view of rationality, which came Ollt 
of Enlightenment evidentialism 
and upon which sc ience is found-
ed). 

As Darwin himself points out in 
Origin of Specie.5 gradual evolution 
by nalural selection (like all scien-
tific theories) carries a heavy bur-
den: 

"If it could be demonsrrated 
that all)' c(lmplex organ f biochemi-
cal system I existed which cOl/ld not 
possibly ha ve been formed by 
numerOI/ S, slIccessive, slight modi-
ficatiolls, my theory would 
absoluteLy break down." 

Behe's argument is that many 
such sys tems exist in the ce ll. 
These systems are what he calls 
" irreducibly complex" and the 
exislence of these systems are 
stumbling blocks to Darwinian 
evolut ion. 

By "irreducibly complex ," Behe 
means ..... a single system com-
posed of severa l, well-matched, 
interacting paris that contribute to 
the basic function , wherei n the 
removal of anyone of these parts

causes the system to effectively 
cease functioning ." The reason that 
an irreducibly complex system is a 
conundrum for the Darwinian is 
because any precursor to an i rre-
ducibly complex system that is 
missing a pari is by definition non-
functional. 

Therefore, since Dr. Behe 
shows cogentl y that there are i rre-
ducibly complex biochemica l sys-
tems, and si nce these syslems are 

irreconcilable with the naturalislic 
and philosophical presuppositions 
of Darwinian theory. reason dic-
tates that belief in Darwinian the-
ory should be suspended until an 
explanation can be given or alto-
gether abandoned. Another possi -
bility is to abandon the naturali s-
tic . 

Science would do beller to 
investi gate other hypotheses (why 
not an intelligent-designer hypoth-
es is'!). 

So, upon closer examinati on of 
Moore's and Behe's arguments we 
see that Behe indeed does not make 
an argument from ignorance. He 
makes an argument from science 
and rationality. 

Also, it should be pointed OUl 
that in order for Moore to accuse 
Behe and Luskin et al of commit-
ting the fall acy «rgulI/en/llm ad 
iglloralltilll1l he himself had to 
commit the straw l1lan fall acy by 
using the term "complex" without 
the qualifier "irreducibl y" and 
other rcwordings. 

The strawman fallacy i to mis-
represent someone's position ~o 
that it can be attacked more easily. 
to knock down that misrepresented 
position, then to conclude that the 
original position has been demol-
ished. It is a fall acy because it fails 
to deal with the actual arguments 
that have heen made. 

As Mr. Moore, I too urge read-

ers who are interested in this topic 
to read Michael Behe's Darwin 's 
Black Box and his critics. Decide 
for yourselves which posilion is 
more coherently reasoned and 
cogent instead of li stening to somc-
one else's reinterpretation of the 
arguments.

Student's Agenda 
Angers Graduates 
Editor: 

After reading Saturday 'S Unio(l 
Tribulle, which revealed recent 
plans to disrupt the all-campus 
commencement. the only thing I 
felt was anger. Now, I don ' t agree 
with Newt Gingrich 's policies, and 
I do nO[ even like the man. What 
angers me more is that a group 
called Diversity in Action plans to 
disrupt my graduation. 

Katie Lane from Diversity in 
Action states that , "A' speaker 
should be chosen who is able to 
inspire the graduating seniors." 

I am amazed that a sophomore 
has the audacity 10 tell me and t!le 
rest of the senior class who is and I . 
who is not inspiring. They further 
take it upon themselves to protest 
or plan to disrupt the graduation in 
the name of the uni versity. 

Well thanks, but no thanks.

ATHLETICS: 
Dynes speaks out in 
favor of move 
Continued from page 3 
seven percent of the students voted 
last spring for a move to Division 
II. I ask you to stand by the stu-
dents on thi s issue:' 

Dynes, in referring to the Campus 
Quality of Life Survey circulated last 
spring. also said he believes that 
UCSD would be more vilal and spir-
ited a.~ a Division II school. 

"Students found the academic 
quality beyond their expectations," 
Dyne.s said. "bul the spirit and 
soc ial life on this campus were 
below expectations and the expec-
tations were low." 

Dynes said he believes that 
movi ng to Di vision II will combat 
this lack in campus li fe. 

"Vibrant sports on thi s campus 
will add to Ihe quality of student 
life here in a real and evident way," 
he added. 

Judy Sweet. director of athletics 
at UCS D for 23 years and national 
president of the CAA for two 
years, also spoke at the meeting 
regarding UCSD's proposed move 
to Division 1I . 

She said that most of the 
Di vision 1II schools are small. with 
an average enrollment of 2.250 stu -
dents, and mostly private. Division 
II schools, on the other hand, are 
most ly public and have an average 
student population of 12,300. 

"Wc don 't pUI together a full 
schedule for a number of our spons 
partly because the Division m insli-
tutions don't want 10 schedule a 
large. public uni versity," Sweet said. 
"We should make a move from 
Division III where we arc a mi sfit." 

Aft er the recommendatiun to 
move to Di vision I I was approved 
by the Academic Senate. mathe-
matics Professor Carl Fi tzgerald 
moved to have the measure dedded 
by a mail hallot. The motion was 
defeated 32 to 10. 

"I believe that other members of 
the Academic Senate have a right to 
votc on a mail ballot," Fitzgerald said. 

Fitzgerald also said he was sur-
prised by Dynes' encouragement of 
sports and cheering on campus. 

"I've never heard an academic 
leader talk that way on this cam-
pus .... It 's not what is respected and 
desired on this campus," he said. 

"We have a great tradition for 
emphasizing alhletics for fun and 
health," Fitzgerald added later. "Jf 
you want that kind of cheering atmos-
phere. you can pick out professional 
teams or other school's learns." 

Fitzgerald also said thaI 
attempts were being made by the 
faculty to petition for a mai I ballot. 

"Twenty-five members need to 
sign a petition for a mail ballol... ... he 
said. 'lhere is a faculty member who 
has said he will write the petitiun." 

If there is a mai I ballot , approx-
imately 1,400 tenure-track facult y 
would have the opportunity to vote 
for or againsl recommending the 
move 10 Division II. 

Ultimately. the decision is up to 
Dynes, who would send a letter to 
the NCAA thi s spring quarter stal-
ing UCSD's intent to beg in the 
move to Division II. 

The move would be completed 
in two years - so the earliest that 
UCSD could compete as a Division 
II school is August 2000. 

" I am very impres~ed with the 
students' commitment a.nd sincerity 
in expressing how important this is 
to them," Sweet sa id. "Wc've heard 
I' e meso age and have responded to 
them."

" I think our legacy will be one 

of change, " Fitzgerald said . 
"Change is hard to come by, and 
it 's hard to change status quo, but 
we were able 10 change many 
thi ngs thi s year. 

" We' ve accomplished a lot, 
we ' ve changed, and we wc' re very 
productive," Fitzgerald continued. 

Fonner Vice President Finance 
Tony Fiori also discussed how he 
felt the A .S shaped UCSD in the 
last year. He pointed to the 
Academic Senate's approval of 
UCSD's move to Division II, the 
admini 'tration's decision to hold an 
all-campus commencement and the 

recent in crease in the Campus 
A ctivity Fee as i ssues that he 
beli eved the A.S. was instrumental 
in helping to pass. 

" No other council has ever 
accomplished something like this," 
Fiori said . 

" I have to say a ' thank you ' 10 
this council, We have not been 
afraid to stand up and make dec i-
ions," Fiori continued. 

Former Commissioner of 
Student Advocacy Tesh Khullar 
shared his thoughts on the work 
that his office has done in the last 
year. He said that he believes his 
office has accomplished much in 
the area of making students more 
aware of the role of the student 
advocate.

their decision. " We do nol find 
those condition and duti es, or the 
board's decision based on them, 
determ inati ve of the state of stu-
dent employees at UCSD morc 
t han a decade later." 

M elman sa id that Friday's dcci-
sion, although it addresses employ-
ees other than TAs, goes against the 
1984 ruling. 

" We bel icve that thi s rece nt 
decision is in conll iet wi th the 
[PERB I decis ion:' Mclman said. 

Melman sa id that the univers ity 
hc lieves lhal students come 10 seek 
uni versity employment for the edu-
cational opponunities that it presents. 

'The uni versity believes that the 
predominant reason that studenls 
are on campus is for their educa-
tional requirements. lheir educa-
tional objec tives, and we think that 
thi s empl oy ment aspec t is sec-
ond ary to that ," Melman said . 

M elman added that the universi -
ty deals with employee unions on a 
regular basi s. 

" We just don' t feel that it is 
appropriate for academic student 
employees," Melman said. 

Navarrete said student employ-
ees should be able to have the same 
bargaining power as regular uni -
vcr ity employees. 

"What the judge ruled was that 
the university is using these people 
[0 provide labor," Navarrete said. 
"They are using them as a resource 
to make money and to teach their 
classes, Therefore they are labor, 
They arc employees, and they have 
to treat lhem like that." 

The decision does not address 
the status of teaching assistants and 
research assistant s, and it does not 
affect the status of readers, lutors 
and teaching associate at olher UC 
campuses. 

Currently, there is a case pend-
ing before a PERB panel that 
would settle the employment status 
of TAs and research assistants at 
UCLA. 

Last year, teaching a sislanls 
and research assistants held 25 total 
days of university wide strikes 
protesting the university 'S failure to 
recognize ASElUAW.

Having been a roadie for several year ' 
with New York hardcore legends Sick

form during one of their shows. 

"Pete [Koller] wrotc a song on the 
road, I wrote some lyrics , and for a 
goof I sang ' My Love Is Real' during 
onc of their encores," Morse said. 

'The crowd loved him, and Morse's

Pioneer of 'Bedroom Culta .. e' 
Dimitri adds French twist to the art of DJing 

By Ilona Fass 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

What started as a hobby in his 
bedroom ended up making Dimitri 
one of the most famous Frenchman 
around. No, not that. (All right, we 
admit this was a cheap trick , but it 
caught your attention, n 'est-ce 
pas?). 

Dimitri's hobby was playing 
around with a mixing deck and a 
pair of turntables for the sheer joy 
of mixing and blending sounds. He 
even coined a term for the healthy 
habit, pioneering what became 
known as "bedroom culturc" for 
people who aren ' t necessarily pro-
fessionals. 

"Their goal is not necessarily to 
go to a club and ma~e people 
dance," Dimitri said. "They ' re 
happy enough blending these 
sounds for themse lves and using 
them to make their own music." 

Dimitri 's intcrest was sparked 
by the way that the first hip-hop

D1s (like Afrika Bambaata) were 
actually manipulating the records 
rather than just throwing them on 
the deck. 

More than a decade ago, Dling 
didn ' t have anything to do with 
what it is now. 

"Basically, you were a juke-
box," Dimitri said. 

Dimitri was enthralled with the 
idea that Dling meant actually 
doing something with the record-
"Not just play it, but play with it." 

His latest album, Sa creblell , 
romps from one end of the musical 
spectrum to another, nawlessly 
combining Left-Bank jazz, swanky 
kitsch, house rhythms and the bub-
bly cocktail lounge instrumental 
music of the swinging '60s. 

For Dimitri , Sacreblell is a col-
lection of styles that appeal to him. 
One minute you're listening to the 
breezy, noating voice of a femm e 
fataL, then it 's house music with an 
emphasis on techno and next it's 

electronic music with French 
dubbed over. 

"I'm a rea l collector of things," 
he said. "I collect toys; I collect 
things from the ' 50s and '60s. 
Everything that [ find interesting. 
kind of just gel it and display it. So 
this album is like a big showcase of 
things that l've got in my mind and 
everywhere else." 

Although the album is a lot of 
things , what it isn ' t is dance. But 
then, Dimitri never set out to make 
a dance album. 

As a D1, Dimitri is the first to 
admit that it's not dance music. 

". don ' t want to clear the dance 
noor," he said . "It wasn't made to 
make people dance. Rather, it's a 
party record you put on in the back-
ground for a lillie get-together. " 

In this genre, Sacreblell hits its 
mark. 

"It 's more of an intimate thing" 
Dimitri said, "It 's music for inti -

ca lled it "One of the best hard-
core/punk albums to come out in 
the last live yea rs." 

Last yea r, H20 released Thicker 
TlulII Water, their IIrst full -length 
effort on Epitaph Records. The 
alhum show<.:ases the band 's tight 
musical delivery, an impressive 
blend of hardcore and melodic 
punk . The hand emphasizes LOpi(;s 
like positi vi ty, loyalty and personal 
responsihilit y in songs sll ch as 
"Wakc p," "Everready" and the 
title track. 

H20's ou tstanding li ve shows 
have increased the band 's reputa-
ti on th roughout the country. After 
adding form er Shelter bassist 
Adam Blake, H20 have toured the 
Un ited States and Canada with 
Murphy's Law. The Misfit s and 
Social Di stortion. The band has 
also so ld out countless headlining 
shows a II over the East Coast. 

H20's phi losophy is summed up 
in Morse's words: 

"Hardcore is not about what you 
cat, drink or wear. It is a way of 
life, the music and the message." 

Now. H20 arc ready to bring that 
message to the world. Do yourself

mate spaces or intimate moments." 

So, what did it take for Dimitri 
to become the mos t sought-after OJ 
in Europe? For starters, he was 
born in Istanbul, Turkey in Octoher 
of 1963 to "hippie intellectuals" 
who traveled arou nd Europe hefore 

• settling in Pari s. 
Next, it took business savvy and 

the right connections. 
Finally, it was Dimitri 's pure 

love for the hcdonistil.: side of go ld-
en-age disC(), which eventually led 
him to old-school hip-hop, house 
and eleclronica. 

Dimitri 's music was infel: tious. 
Soon he was offe red a job at the 
European radio station CFM . By

on to the "bedroom I:ullure," they 
were hunting him down left and

Dimitri's sucl:ess didn ' t stop 
there. Designers like Chanel , 
Gaultier, Hermes, Fendi and Lager-
fe ld wanted him to choreograph the 
music for their runway fashion 
shows. _ 

Before long, hi s music had rede-
fined the meaning of the IreI chic 
Parisian nightlife. 

"I know it 's very strange music 
in general ," Dimitri said, "and 
probably too stran ge for the mass 
market. But then again , it wasn ' t 
designed to be a mass-market 
thing. It is a ve ry, very personal 
record. 

"I try to make my music as 
accessible a~ it can be." he added. 
"M y goal i ~ to loudl people not to 
make music for a small l: irde of

gratulating themselves."

"The Big Hit," starri ng Mark Wahlherg,

Hollywood's latest.. . acti on muvie? No, 
wait. Comedil UIll, not quite. Acti on-
Drama? 0, not really. Comcdo-melodra-
mati l.: ky-aetion film ? Thi s is exactly the 
prohlem. 

"The Big Hit" is the latest action movie 
co-produced by John Woo of Hong Kong 
action movie fame ("The Killer," "Hard 
Boi led"). Woo has also produced recent 
films in the United Stales such as 
"Face/On" and "The Rep lacement Ki lIers." 

"The Big Hi t" attempts to create what is 

supposed to he an intense. fast-paced story 
riddled with comedy. Unfortunately, this 
mix is dangerous for even the Illost experi -
en(;ed tilmmaker. 

Many limes movies have used the com-
bination succes 'fully - James Camcron's 
"True Lies" and John McTiernan's "Die 
Hard" pri mari Iy took on t he roles of serious 
stories with humor plal:ed carefully through-
oul. 

The plot of "The Big Hit," written by 
Ben Ramsay, attempts to balance these story 
I:onventions evenl y, leaving the audience 
confused and nOl sure whether to watch the 
movie from the 'perspec tive of comedy or 
action drama. 

The story follows Melvin (Wahlhcrg), a

An Evening of Comedy 
UCSD student stars in (A n Evening to Remember' 

By Ilona Fan 
Co·Hiatus Editor 

Sophomore Laura Brenneman stars in 
Christopher Durang's Ihree-part co medy, 
"An Evening to Rcmemher," opening 
tomorrow night at the Artists' Forum on 
ca mpus. Thc produdion , consisting of three 
IO-minule cOl11edies from Ihe Al.:t or's The-
atre of Louisville. Ky., is presented by Sec-
ond Slar Productions. 

Brenneman , who is studying musil: com-
position, will play Meg in "Actor 's Night-
mare." In addition, she wi ll appear in a few 
minor roles in the other three plays. 

For Brenneman, who grew up singing, 
aCling was the natural evolution of her artis-
tic development. 

"It was rewarding and I:omfortable in its 
own ri ght ," she sa id . 

Brenneman admits that it is sometimes 
difficult to lind the time to juggle play 
rehearsa ls, which take up three or four hours 
of her day. with her sl:hool work 

"I enjoy it ," Brenneman said. "So it 
doe,n' t ,ee m like work even though it is." 

This past winter quarter Laura was 
part of the ensemble of "UBU Rock," and 
last year she was in three I.:abare ts. At the 
1l10ment , however, she has no plans for 
future plays. 

"I'm focusing more on my music COI11-
position," she said . 

Some may remember Durang from last 
year's undergraduate production of "Bette 
and Boo." Compared to Durang's other 
works, this play is relatively tame, accord-
ing to UCSD alumna Marjorie Treger, one 
of the play's dire<.:tors. 

Second Star is mounting the plays in its 
new space within the Artists' Forum. This is 
an exciting event for the production compa-
ny bCl:ause Jl is the first time it will be per-
forming in its own space. . 

Trcger said th at the impetus W SHirt Sec-

ond Star was to provide opportunitie ' for 
local al.:tors to work legally. This theater wi II 
provide more opportunities for local actors. 

"·As a union member yuu can't work i r 
it's not a union production," Treger said. 

Another benefi t of the company, and 
one of it s goa ls, is to explore works not as 
cOl11 ll1erl:ia l as those. presented at the Old 
Globe, the La Jolla Playhouse or even the 
Repertory Theater. 

Rather, Second Star is interested in the-
ater that is "actor- and word-based" as 
opposed to the tedmical aspects of any 
parlieu lar play. 

"It 's not the playwrights that interestl11e," 
Treger said. "It's the experience of the play." 

Performanl:es will be at 8 p.m. Friday 
and Spiurday evenings, May I , 2, 8, 9, IS

Locals are in the Business of Promoting the Scm Diego lifestyle 
SRH Cofounder Ryan White lends insight into the makings of his business endeavor 

By Eran Maor 
Staff Writer 

What started si mply as two 
friends throwing parties has 
become an influential production 
company which embodies the San 
Diego board-riding lifestyle. 

SRH is a production company 
dedicated to the surf, skate and 
snowboard culture that dominates 
San Diego. 

SRH's multi-faceted business 
manifests itself as a clothing com-
pany, a record label and a produc-

tion company that promotes clubs 
and show . SRH ha gone interna-
tional, promoting its clothes, music 
and shows as far away as Australia 
and Japan. 

The company gpcs back to the 
summer of 1992 when co-founder 
Kevin Zinger approached friend 
Ryan White about helping him pro-
mote a club on Thursday nights at 
Diego's in Pacific Beach (where 
P.B. Bar and Grill is now located). 
They called it Psyclone, and in no 
time the two partners turned an 

empty club into a big hit. 
Promoting local bands at their 

shows was a natural step forward. 
The production company quickly 
established itself in the San Diego 
lifestyle. 

Building on the success of their 
club and promotions, a clothing 
line was their next endeavor. With 
the help of Carter Gibbs, a clothing 
designer and San Diego native, 
SRH complemented its promotions 
with creati ve clothing designs 
based on the now-famous SRH 

icon, 
SRH has grown surprisingly in 

such a very short time. It 's impor-
tance to San Diego culture can't be 
denied. 

"You have someone clubbing at 
Studio 64 [an SRHlScholar produc-
tion] at four in the morning, and at 
6 a.m. there is someone ripping it 
[surfing] in our board shorts," 
White said. 

This exposure has brought SRH 
to the attention of other places that 
embody the same kind of culture. 

SRH is continuously evolving. 
At times more emphasis is placed 
on certain areas than' others. The 
record label is relatively new 
although SRH promoted bands 
from the beginning. . 

The production company has 
been affiliated with bands like No 
Doubt, Penny wise and Korn. New 
acts on the label include Lucy 's Fur 
coat, Sprung Monkey, Kolton-
mouth Kings and The Price of 
Dope. .

In "Suburban Life," the group ' ~

"Suburban life, the American 
Dream! Suburban life, so prelty and 
clean! Suburban life, ain't whaL it

The Koltonmouth Kings nevcr

but provc that they contend with 

M-
problems of their own, albeit in a 
less violent sett ing than their inner-
city counterparts. 

"Frontline" is the EP's high 
point, cen tered around a thick. 
infectious bas -line, while the 
group sings a catchy chorus in 
between rapped verses, "Roll It 
Up" and "3 Horny Devi ls" are self-
ex.planatory. the former a sonic 
homage to Bob Marley, the laller a 
sonic homage to themselves.

SRH: 
.-Local promoting 
agency cleans up 
Continued from pa •• 14 

Whi le other companies may try 
to tic beach culture music and 
clothing together, White maintains 
that SRH is the only legitimate 
company that fully supports the 
lifestyle. 

"We don ' t just have bands that 
wear our c1Olhe~ when they per-
form," White said . '"We are good 
friends with the members and help 
them oul. You can sometimes see 
me pass ing out nycrs ou tside the 
shows to help promote these bands. 
We truly helieve in them." 

Since 1992, SRH has practica lly 
hecome synonymous with the 
lifestyle scene embodied in most 
18- to 29-year-o lds in San Diego. 

onethelcss, White maintains 
that although SRH's success is not 
m;cidental , it was never predicted 
to he ~o influential on San Diego's 
culture. 

"We never sat around and 
thought of a ~tra tegy or markeling 
plan," he said. "S RH basica lly 
evolved on it s own." 

Consideri ng SRH's ni che, 
White's me llow demeanor and the 
carefree atmosphere at the SRH 
offi ce, one can ' t help but see the 
cumpany as a reflection of its 
founders. 

HIT MEN: 
Is it an action film 
or a comedy? 
Continued from page 13 
the goddaughter o t' their boss , Paris 
(Brooks). 

Up to this point, the plot is seri -
ous. Melvin 's predi~ament places 
in the middle of watching the kid-
napped girl and catering 10 his girl-
friend (Applegate) and her visiting ' 
parents. 

nder one roof, Melvin attempts 
to juggle dead bodies, the kid-
napped girl and his unknowing 
housegues ts - creating more 
scenes remini scent of " I Love 
Lucy" than the origi nal seri es had 
itself. At this poinl. it wouldn't have 
been surprising to have his girl -
fri end turn to Melvin with , "Honey, 
you've got some 'splainin ' to do ." 

Then again, the comedy seems 
to take over all remaining elements 
of a serious story as Melvi n and the 
kidnapped gi rl (who comes across 
as about 14 years old) seem to fa ll 
in love while simultaneously mas-
saging and stuffing a chicken being 
prepared for dinner. Oil plus sea-
soning equals love? 

Later, during a very intense car 
chase sequence, one of the cars is 
pushed off the read and then off a 
cliff only to he s.lved by the lone 
tree branch sli t:ki :1g out of the 
canyon wall. Pirst It 's "Lucy," now 
it's "Looney Tu r.c~." 

The script, iike many others, 
developed out of a great premise 
but unfortunalely couldn 't decide 
what it wanted to be, creating si tu-
ations and lines that came across as 
barely intentional and only enter-
taining to laugh at rather than with. 

At one point, Melvin turns to 
Keiko with an intense yet con-
cerned look in his face and says, 
"I' m going to go into that video 
store and when I come out, if you 
sti" want to. wc' re going to make'

Mad Dogs and Englishmen 
Madness showcased their nutty sound at RIMAe Tuesday night 

By Scott Yager 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

It isn't often you get a chance 
to sec rock legends perform live. 
It 's even less orten that you get LO 
see Madness perform. 

Tuesday night , Madness put on 
an incredible show aL RIMAC as 
part of their Mad Dogs and Eng-
lishmen tour, their first American 
lOur in 14 years. 

After patient ly waiting 
through the slew of opening 
hands, the huge crowd beeame 
antsy whi le the slage was pre-
pared for Madness. Finally, the 
band took the stage, a huge "M" 
banner was unfurled behind the 
drum kiL and the RIMAC crowd 
went crazy. 

Madness kicked off their sel 
with one of their most recogniz-
able songs, a bouncy cover of 
Prince Buster's "One Step 
Beyond." Clad in sharp sui ts and 
sporting its usual fl at-top hai rcuts, 
the band appeared confident and 
commanding. The musicianship 
was impeccable, and Madness had 
the crowd eating OUl of their 
hands. 

Madness made their way 
through most of thei r hits, includ-
ing "It Must Be Love," !'Grey 
Day" and "Tomorrow's Ju st 
Another Day." Between songs, 
lead si nger Graham "Suggs" 
McPherson bantered with the 

audience, of len giving the songs 
humorous introductions. 

Other high lights of the hour-
and-a-half set included '" Huuse of 
Fun." "Shut Up" and the hand's 
1983 signaLure piece, "Our 
House." Throughout rhe set. the 
RIMAC Iloor was a sea of danc-
ing people, all hot and ~weaty bur 
jubilant in witnessing the specra-
c1e. 

A fter Madness left the stage, 
the audience clamored for more. 
The band returned for a s.hort 
encore, which featured an instru-
mental song Lhat kept the crowd 
moving. 

Afler Madness left the stage 
again, the audience immediately 
ca lled them out for a second 
encore. Looking a bit laken aback 
by the audience's enthusiasm, 
McPherson said, "Any Lime 
you'd like us LO come back, 
please gi ve us a ca ll. lL 's been a 
pleasure." 

Madness then launched into a 
cover of Jimmy Cliff 's "The 
Harder They Come," before clos-
ing Lhe show with a repeaL perfor-
mance of "One Step Beyond." 

Upon the band 's exit, McPher-
son said, "We' ll see you again. 
Who knows where, who knows 
when." Hopefully it won't be too 
long. 

The upeni ng bands all turned 
in exce llent performances, and 

all of lhem seemed to be thrilled 
to share the stage with their 
heroes . 

Dance Hall Crashers played an 
exuberant but . Ii ghlly abbrevialed 
set, givi ng the crowd a healthy 
dose of ska -punk . The band 
opened with "Go," from its Lock-
jaw album, and then proceeded to 
romp through a few other songs. 
including "Enough," "Mr. Blue" 
and "Queen For A Day." 

Roya l Crown Revue handled 
the swing portion of the evening's 
festivi li es, deli vering an energetic 
and stylish performance. Kicking 
off with '"Zip Gun Bop," the band 
continued with "Barflies On The 

Beac~," "Work Is A Four-Letter 
Word" and "Hey Pachuco! ," ils 
best-known song. 

Reel Big Fish performed a 
great set that featured most of 
their usual songs as well as a few 
new ones. Arter starting off wit h 
the radio hit "Sellout," the band 
ran through lesser-known songs 
such as "Beer," "S noop Dog, 
Baby" and "S.R." 

Other highlights included the 
band 's cover of Duran Duran's 
" Hungry Like The Wolr' and 
"The Kids Won ' t Like It," one of 
RB F's new tunes. The onl y 
detraction to their set were the 
indi viduals who didn't get the sar-
casm underlying the band's anti -
moshing anthem, "In The Pit."

RUGBY 
UCSD is scheduled to move up 

to Division " in the upeoming 
years. But it mig ht get its first Di vi-
sion II National Championship a 
lillie early - like thi s weekend. 

Last Saturday, UCSD' vaunted

secutive Southern California Colle-
giate Rugby Championship, guar-
anteeing a slot for the lads at the 
first Division Il National Champi-
onships, to be held May 1-3 in 
Albany, N.Y.

and has received a No. 4 seed. 
There will be eight squads present, 
and UCSD will take on the Eastern 
Rockies and West Territory Ch~m­
pion Western Stare College, the No. 
5 sced. / 

The ruggers received such high

SoCal title. Fantastic play from 

The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD Sports Clubs 
Andy "Wilma" Wilga, Chay 
"Gangsta" Chang, Troy Meyer and 
especially Courtney Geigle gave 
UCSD a tight 22-17 victory. 

As the lads head for Albany, 
they take with them an amazing 
season, and hopes of returning with 
a National Championship plaque. 

If you're a dedicated fan , don' t 
be afraid to buy plane tickets. The 
ruggers could usc your sup port.

WOMEN'S 
LACROSSE 

Two Sundays ago, UCS D's 
women's lacrosse squad 10'st a 
squeaker to UCLA in overt ime. 
Last Friday, the two teams met 
agai n. This time, UCS D was deter-
mined not to suffer the same fa te on 
its own Pryntel Field. 

UCS D grahhed an early lead 
when Jcn Si lhavy scored two min-
utes into the game. The team con-
ti nued the pace wi th 6 more goals, 

closing out the first half with a 7-2 
lead. 

In the second half, UCLA went 
on a streak, scoring 5 goa ls in fi ve 
minutes. In an effort to SlOp the 
bleeding, UCSD call ed a timeout. 
The SlOppas.e of play swayed the 
momentum and UCSD was able to 
hold on for a 11 - 10 wi n. 

The victory sent the squ ad on to 
face UC Santa Barhara on Sunday 
in a game whose wi nner wou ld 
head to the Final Four. 

The firs t half saw an even scar-

ing atlack on both sides and at the 
half the game was tied. However, 
UCSB went ahead in the second 
half to secure the game, 13- 10. 

UCSD's Marissa Bell demon-
strated outstand ing teamwork and 
offensive prowess, scoring 2 points 
despite suffering a pulled ham-
stri ng. 

Chri s Moll, Elsa-Jennie Bliss, 
Mamie Binder and Angelique Bon-
ner also played well in the game. 

First-year player Shannon Shel-
don had a burst of energy down the 
fie ld late in the game to give her 
team a goal late in the game. 
Unfortunately it was not enough. 

The game closed out the season 
for UCSD, hut it was far from a di s-
appoint ing fini sh. 

"We grew together as a fa mily 
team th is year, maturing mentall y 
and techn iea ll y," Head Coach 
Grace Park said. "We look li ke we 
have heen play ing together for 
years."

Fresno Feels Fine 
COMPETITION: Triton give Divi ion I schools a big-time scare 
By Saul Sheridan 
Staff Writer 

Who says that a Division III school can' t 
compete with a Division I school? Those who 
think that UCSD has no business trying to 
compete with the likes of UCLA and 
UC Berkeley and beli eve that stu-
dents at UCSD should spend their 
time studying a -Chern need to come 
by Triton Track and Field Stadium 
and see what thi s school is capable 
of. 

This past weekend the best track 
and fi eld athletes from all over Ca li -
fornia and evada. regardless of 
divi. ion, competed in the California-Nevada 
Championships at Fr.::sno State Uni versity. 
UCSD proved that Division JII schools can 
compcte against some of the most competiti ve 
schools in the country. 

"Anytime you face Divi ion I school like 
UCLA or Cal, it is sort of intimidating," 
Amero said. "But it is that level of competi -
tion that raises your game and improves your 
performance." 

Among those that enjoyed suc-
cess and improved their perfor-
mances on the season were senior 
runner Kirk Miller and sophomore 
runner Meghan Scotl. 

Miller ran a 'easonal best 54.29 in 
the preliminary round of the 400-
meter intermediate hurdles, provi-
sionally qualifying him for Nation-
als. He fi ni shed ninth in the final s. 

SCOII recorded a personal best in the 
3,OOO-meters with a time of 10:30.67, one full 
second beller than her previous besl. 

"I was hoping to improve my time by 
more," Scott said. "but I would have to say 
that overall I am happy with my perfor-
mance." 

It was a successful weekend for the Triton 
track and fi eld team in what was probably the

UCSD Struggles in Ojai 
REBOUND: The Tritons defeated Point Lorna after a tough tournament in Ojai 
By Bill Bur,.r 
Staff Writer 

On Sunday, UCSD played its 
last home match of the year, signal -
ing the end of a great season and 
the beginning of the post-
season. The TrilOns played 
host to Point Lorna 
Nazarene College and won 
easily, 8-l 

The story of the week-
end was, however, the 
annual Ojai Tournament 
held Saturday and Sunday, 
which decided the individ-
ual Regional Champions in tenni s 
singles and doubles. For the fan, 
the Ojai tournament offers a level 
of play thaa exceeds most others. 

The Ojai features Division I, II 
and III play, which means a Divi-
sion III first-round loser can play 
on a court next to the eventual 
PAC- IO champion. This makes for 
an electri c atmosphere and an 
unimaginab le se nse of urgency. 

The Tritons went into the lOur-
nament with high hopes for their 
four singles players, but were dis-
appointed carlyon. 

Kai Miller was over-matched in 
th e first round by even tual singles 
champion Tho mas Oechel from 
UC Santa Cruz. This unlucky draw 
ended Miller's tournament quickly. 

UCSD's Anthony Melicharek 
also had a tough draw and lost to 
Pomona 's No. I player, Ken Suo 

Emi l Mihet pulled a victory in 
the first round, but lost in the sec-
ond . 

Head Coach Brian Turner char-
acterized this second game as " a 

bad and disappointing loss." 
Steve Shabel, ranked No. 3 

going into the tournament and 
UCSD's best chance to win the 
tournament, won his first- and sec -

ond-round matches before 
falling to eventual finalist 
Danny Kim in a 6-3, 6-7, 
2-6 battle. 

The Tritons placed 
only two teams in the dou-
bles' tournament. 

Mike Rosset and 
M elicharek won their 
fir t-round match before 

falling to the eventual finalists from 
Santa Cruz. 

Shabel and Mihet won in the 
first round, 6-0, 6-0, and also won 
their second-round match before 
losing a tough 6-7, 4-6 match to 
tournament champions Oechel and 
Brian Cummings. 

When the Tritons finally made it 
home to La Jolla late Sunday night, 
Point Lorna await.ed them. 

The odds seemed stacked 
against UCSD, facing a team that 
had already defeated the University 
uf Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer 
College earlier this season - both 
of which had the Tritons' number in 
previous matches. To make it even 
tougher, Shabel, the Tritons' No. I 
player, was unable to make the 
match due to class conflicts. 

Despite the seemi ngly hopeless 
situation, the Tritons went out and 
performed incredibly well in dou-
bles. Mihet teamed up with Vincent 
Darmohusado in Shabel's absence. 
The duo never missed a beat as it 
cruised to an 8-3 victory. 

Melicharek and Rosset lost a 
heart-breaking 8-9 set while serv-
ing for the match. 

Ken Liu and Dan Albrecht won 
a crucial match at No. 3 doubles by 
a score of 8-5 to win doubles' 
poi nts for the Tritons. 

"We were inconsistent," Liu 
said. "We played pretty sloppy but 
managed to pull it out." 

No. I singles was a very enter-
taining match as Mihet won the 
first set, 6-4, before falling in the 
final two sets, 3-6, 5-7. 

Liu played a tough match at No. 
2 singles but fell just short, 6-7, 4-
6. Melicharek was frustrated by his 
opponent all day and fell quickly, 
0-6,4-6. 

Rosset played nearly flawless 
tennis on his way to a 6-3, 6-2 vic-
tory at No. 4 singles. Albrecht's 
match was never in doubt as he 
cruised to a 6-4, 6-0 victory at No. 
5 singles. 

'" was having more trouble with 
the flies buzzi ng in my face than I 
was with my opponent," Albrecht 
said. 

Jason Hipp, who was inserted 
into the lineup after missing the last 
few matches due to tendentious in 
his houlder, looked impressive in a 
6- 1, 6-2 victory. 

The split in singles coup led with 
the doubles victory gave the Tritons 
an unlikely 4-3 victory, possibly 
thei r biggest of the season. 

The Tritons, now 7-8 on the 
year, will matc h up with Claremont 
College this Saturday in a match 
that will determine if they make it 
to the Regional Playoffs. 

Crusaders Topple UCSD 
UNSCHEDULED: The Tritons lost an unscheduled game to Point Lorna, 8-7 
By John Maynard 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons have been on fire 
lately, winning 10 out of their last 
12 games. At home they have been 
sensational, losing only 
once in their own yard in 
over a month. 

Tuesday 's game. how-
ever, was an exception. 

Though Point Lorna 
Nazarene's season was 
officially over, the recent 
strong play exhibited by 
the Tritons was enough to 
convince the Crusaders that going 
head-to-head with the -men of La 
Jolla would be a tough and exciting 
battle. 

Though the play had its slop, 
with each team committing 3 
errors, the game was indeed excit-
ing. . 

Despite the excitement , the Tri -
lons were left with little to smile 
about as the Crusaders outlasted 
the Tritons, prevailing 8-7. 

Coming off a olid se ries 
against Menlo College and not 
expecting to play until this week-
end 's Triton Clas ic, UCSD may 
havc been a little unprepared for 
Tuesday 's unscheduled game. 

This was evident as the Tritons 
quickly fell behind in the lOp of lhe 
fi rst. 

Junior pitcher John Willis start-
ed things off on the mound for the 
Tritons, but struggled carly on. The 
first three batters Willis faced hit 
him hard, accounting for 2 runs in 
the top of the first. 

After a Triton goose-egg in the 
boltom half of the first, the Cru-
saders charged the plate in the top 
of the second 10 bring home anoth-
er 4 runs (2 of them unearned), to 

take a formidable 6-0 
lead. 

IL took the Tritons 
t h ree - and- t wo - th i rd s 
innings to get a hit off the 
Point Loma starter, and 
another pair of innings to 
score. 

As the Tritons have 
lived and died by late-

inning heroics thi s season, the sixth 
inning looked as if UCSD was 
going to be able to pull another 
miracle. 

The Tritons finally came alive in 
the sixth, cutting the Crusader lead 
in half. 

This 3- run inning was initiated 
by second baseman Kenny Fluhar-
ty, whose 2-run ingle drove home 
center fielder Dave Myers and 
Caicher Rampi Gulati. First base-
man Eric Pangelinan's fielder 's 
choice brought home left fielder 
George Escanuelas for the third run 
of the inning. 

From here, UCSD's hopes start-
ed to look promising again. The 
Trit ons carried thei r sixth-inning 
momentum out onto the field. 

Triton reliever Yeshayah Gold-
farb took the mound in the seventh 
and struck out the first batter he 
faced . Although the next two bat-
ters reached base, Goldfarb got out 
of the inning, forcing a clutch dou-
ble play. 

Arter its so lid defense, UCSD 
came out big in the bottom of the 
seventh and scored 4 runs, snatch-
ing the lead from the Crusaders. 
Gulati , Escanuelas and Mark 
Mason each had RBi s, while Myers 
scored on an error. 

With a 7-6 lead into the top of 
the eighth, it seemed as if the Triton 
comeback was blooming into a 
flowery success. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't to be as 
the Triton defense wilted, giving up 
bOlh the tying and go-ahead runs. 
In thi s eighth-inning disappoint-
ment, the Crusaders' runs were 
unearned. To add to the heartbreak, 
both runs were scored with two 
outs. 

In Triton fashion, the UCSD ' 
bats put together a small rally in the 
bottom of the ninth, hopi ng to 
equalize the 8-7 deficit. Unfortu-
nately, it was merely a tease. as 
UCSD was unable to bring home 
the tying run. 

Pangelinan 's words perhaps 
summarized the game for the Tri -
tons, who yielded only 6 hits and 
commi tted 3 error. 

"1 had a tough time today:' Pan -
ge linan said . " I didn ' t hit, I had an 
error and was caught stealing." 

Despite Tuesday 's unfortunate 
10 ' S, the Tritons are looking ahead 
to thi s weekcnd 's UC San Diego 
Triton Classic, where the Tritons 
will host teams from La Verne, 
Menlo and Chapman. 

The Tritons will play four 
games, hoping to get back on top of 
their home field domination.

Sure EI Nino made it tough on golfers during the win-
ter months. Several local area courses suffered through 
all the storms. But. all that rain has lelt San Diego's 
tairways and greens in the best shape we've seen in 
years. For thiS 3rd stop of the year on the 1M Tour we 
are fortunate to be playing at one of San Diego's top 

y..;aiIO_ golf resorts, Singing Hilts. 
The format is Individuat stroke ptay. Ya, it's your score, 

you've got to lace the music on the 18th green when you add 'em all up. The 
event takes place over two days. The first day brings out every kind of swing imaginable. Low 
handicappers and first timers both will enjoy 8 day in the sun on the course. After the lirst round 
the field will be cut in half and the serious hackers will retum on Saturday lor the tinal round. 
That's when the knees knock and even a 2-toot putt will cause a mental breakdown. 

The event tees 011 tomorrow at 1 :30pm. Tee times are tilling fast, so il you want to reserve a 
spot. check in with the 1M Department on the 4th tloor of RtMAC or call 534-37 t 6 lor more

Let The Dunking 
Begin At Sun God 

I come down the baseline 
with one dribble, grit my teeth , 
leap up, turn around to face the 
basket, cock the ball completely 
behind my head and pound it, 
through the rim with frightenin~ 
intensity, spread-eagle, do a 
quick chin-up, slap the back-
board on the way down, and yell 
out, "It's sooo pretty." I give the 
crowd the "raise the roof' sign 
the whole way as I backpedal 
down court . I call that onc the 
" R i m- wrec k a-d i s rcs pccta -
around- t hc -world - Iook -out -
boys-and-girls mojo-on-your-
dojo." 

I' m a prclly tall guy with a 
little experiencc playing baskct-
ball, so this kind of thing hap-
pens to mc all the time. At Icast, 
it happens in my head all the 
time. The fact is, it only happens 
oncc a year on a very special 
day. As the clouds continue to 
dissipate daily and May approa-
cheth, my body tell s me that the 
special day is again nearing. 

Little more than two weck ' 
remain until the annual Sun God 
Basketball Tournament. For all 
who have played before this 
should be enough said. For 
those ~ho don 't know about it , 
let me brief you on the intra-
mural highlight of the year: 

The tourney takes place at 
the Muir courts Saturday morn -
ing and into the afternoon on the 
day after the Sun God fracas . 
Hangovers are tough, and a Sun 
God hangover can be especially 
excruciating. My buddies and I 
have a special cure: a couple 
Tylenol, a Jamba Juice and a 
secret herbal potion which 1 
won't disclose, as it gives us a 
superhuman advantage. 

So I slurp my smoothie and 
pretty soon I'm feeling the now 
and we're all ready to get it on. 
There are all kinds of teams. 
The runt teams play early in the 
morning (around 9 a.m. , ] 
recall) and the better squads get 
to play around noon. Either way 
it 's too early, but since it get 
real hot in the afternoon, it 's just 
as well to get the party startcd 
before the sun peaks. 

The big auraction is that the 
rims arc lowered, enabling the 
likes of me to uncork those 
wicked bashe I've only execut-
ed on a Nerf hoop. Once it was 
sponsored by Hooters but, alas, 
none of the waitre ~es showed 
up, which was probably better 
for their safety because it's a 
pretty masculine scene. 

So here's a call to the inter-
national fraternity of Phi Slam-
rna Jamma. For one day we can 
all be members. I know the 
hoopin' talent pool at UCSD 
isn't deep enough for wading, 
but for one day even u s~rubs 
can enter a dunk contest.

Standing on the 18th green at the Torrey Pines Golf 
Cour e on Monday during th~ UCSD golf team's la t match 
before Nationals, two perplexi ng thoughts entered my mind 

- what the hell is the San Diego Golf 
Academy, and why is one of its players 
smoking a cigarette? . 

Having just enough brain cells to com-
prehend one answer, I was told that the 
Golf Academy is a two-year business 
school where students earn a license to 
teach golf professionally. 

Professional or amateur, the Tritons 
make it an annual habit of defeating the 

Academy - a feat they accomplished last Monday after-
noon at the South Course. 

Led by James Donahoe's 74 (he has obviously finished 
his fraternity rush), UCSD finished four strokes ahead of the 
Academy with a 310. 

Fellow sophomore Darrin Sullivan (San Pasqual High 
School alumnus) followed with a solid 77. 

Captain Greg Uberuaga was one behind with a 78, while 
his partner and fellow senior Jeremy Byrd notched a 81 . 

Kevin Petrie and Greg Johnson completed the course at 
83. Petrie withstood a life-threatening bailie with flu-like 
symptoms to fini sh the round - collapsing on the 18th green. 

The Tritons will now prepare for Nationals, which will 
be held at Jeckyl Island, Ga., May 12-15. 

"We' ll play at the Oleander course, which is the tougher 
of the two courses there," Triton Head Coach Mike Wydra 
said. "It 's a lot tighter, more doglegs, more water hazards .... 
I think that suits us better because we're used to tough 
courses. Obviou Iy, Methodi t is the team to beat." 

Methodist College has won six of the past seven tourna-
ments. There is one simple explanation to its dominance. 
Methodist has a Golf Management major, and it gives out "aca-
dcmic" scholarships to those who will fare well in this subject.

II Tee, Anyone?: Senior Jeremy Byrd follows through with his tee shot at the par-3 

16th hole at the Torrey Pines South Course. 

"They could very well compete with the top Division I 
programs in the country," Su llivan said. "If we' re right 
behind them going into the last day, we have a good chance 
of taking them. Coming from behind, you can be aggressive 
and you can put pressure on them." TRITONS SEND ACADEMY BACK TO TRAINING Wydra echoed Sullivan 'S sentiments. "It 's amazing in golf how fast a lead can disappear," Wydra said. "When you're ahead all the time, you 've got a 
lot of pressure on you. Like Satchel Paige said, 'Never look 
back because someone's gaining on you. '" Golf Looks to Nationals 

Let the Games Begin Against Amherst 
VIRGINIA: The postseason begins on May 5 in Virginia as the Triton's take on 16-1 Amherst College 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

They say that in May, the 
weather in Virginia is quite gay. 
Spring gives way to lazy summer 
days as flowers bloom and birds 
chirp away. Not to say that San 
Diego docsn ' t compare, but they 
say Virginia can make you stare. 

When the UCSD women's ten-
nis team travels to the Common-
wealth State this Sunday in prepa-
ration for the NCAA Division 111 
National Championships (May 5-
II), it will undoubtedly be in for a 
real treat. Held at the campus of 
Washington and Lee University in 
Lexington, the tournament will-
begin on Tuesday as 14 teams from 
around the country fight for the 
right to be called champions. 

After they squeeze in a bit of 
sightseeing, the Tritons (11 -8) will 

. square off against Amherst College 
at II :30 a.m. EST on Tuesday in 
first-round action. 

If UCSD can get past Amherst, 
it will face Trinity University 
(Texas) in Quarterfinal action. The 
two squads met earlier this year in 
Arizona when the Tritons came 
close to stealing a victory before 
falling, 5-4, to the TIgers.

laPlante said, "so we know they 
are going to be tough. But it's 
Nationals, and every match is 
going to be tough. We're going to 
have to play our best tennis to 
advance. 

"The key is going to be our dou-
bles play," LaPlante continued. 
' ~We've struggled this year and it 
would be nice if we could get a lead 
going into singles."

but rallied to win 4 of 6 ingle

"The win was an important one 
for us," laPlante said. "It was a 
really good tune-up for us and it 's 
great to have some momentum 
going into next week. We just need 
to work some more on our doubles

happened, and one thing is for sure:
