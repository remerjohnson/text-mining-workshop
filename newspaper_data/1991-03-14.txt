Price Center TG With Beer Will be Held April 12 
• Police chief must give event final approval, but is said to be 'very supportive' 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Staff Writer 

1be future of the TGs on campus 
is nearly secured. according to A.S. 
President John Edson. 

Edson said that the first TG with 
free beer since January will likely 
takeplaceat6p.m.onApriI12atthe 
Price Center. 

1be service of alcohol at the TGs 
was declared illegal by the Califor-
nia Department of Alcoholic Bev-
erage Controi in January because 
TGs are accessible to the public. 

At that time, Edson introduced a 
plan to close off the Price Center so 
that only UCSD students and em-
ployees could attend. 

However, 19 Staff Pro private 
security guards would have been 
required under the security plan, 

which would have incurred too high 
acosl 

Recently, Edson said, the plan 
was rewritten to require only nine 
Staff Pro security guards on site 
during the event. lbe other 10 Staff 
Pro guards will be replaced with 
volunteer students. 

The plan, which has gained the 
approval of Associate Vice Chan-
cellor of Student Programs and Fa-
cilities Tom Tucker, Director of 
Student Government Services 
Randy Woodard, and others, will go 
before Police Chief John Anderson 
once a band has been selected. 

According to Tucker, "Our indi-
cation is that [Anderson] is going to 
support it." Tucker said he expects 
Anderson to be flexible in terms of 
security arrangements. 

Over $450 Stolen in 
General Store Robbery 
By Mary Betty Heard 
Associate News Editor 

Bills, checks, and travelers 
checks totaling $463.36 were 
taken from the General Store 
Cooperative in the Student 
Center during business hours 
Tuesday afternoon. 

The suspect, a six-foot-tall, 
25-30 year-old black male of 
muscularbuild,reachedoverthe 
service counter and took a stack 
of bills, checks, and travellers 
checks from the $20 slot in the 
cash register, according to Gen-
eral Store employee Randy 
Corpuz. 

Corpuz, a Revelle College 
senior and senior clerk at the c0-
op, was working the cash regis-
ter at the time of the robbery. 

According to Corpuz, the 
man, who was unarmed, ap-
proached the counter at approxi-
mately 3 p.m. and asked for 
change for a dollar, specifying 

three quarters, two dimes, and a 
nickel. 

"I took the money," Corpuz said. 
"As I was putting the dollar in and 
gathering the change, he leaned over 
and grabbed the stack of $20s." 

" One thing he said that I thought 
was odd was, 'I'm sorry I have to do 
this, '" he added. 

He also noted that the suspect did 
not physically threaten him. 

Warren Zimmer of the UCSD 
Police Department said that he 
would not call the suspect's com-
ment significant. 

"As he took off, I realized what 
was happening. I froze at first, then 
took off after him," he said. 

Corpuz said that as he chased the 
suspect, he called for help, trying to 
tell people to stop the suspect. 
"Nobody did, which I guess is un-
derstandable," he said. 

According to Corpuz, the sus-
pect led him on a chase to the Stu-
dent Center parking lot, where the 

Police Chief John Anderson 
"Chief Anderson is very sup-

portive," Tucker added. 
According to Edson, the TG will 

beheld. 
Only minor details of the new 

security plan, such as how many 

student volunteers are needed for 
security, are likely to be discussed 
by Anderson, he said. 

Anderson, who brought up the 
i sue of legality last year, said, "of 
course I'm willing to be flexible." 
But, since he has not een the secu-
rity plan yet, he cannot know for 
sure. 

Previously, Anderson had indi-
cated he would endorse any plan 
that fits within the parameters of the 
law. 

"We have to assure that the law 
will be followed and that we miti-
gate the obvious safety and security 
concerns," he said.

alcohol wa overcome Monday 
when the University Center Board

suspect hid between the line of cars. 

"I was looking in-between the 
cars to see ifhe was hiding there .... 
AsI went around thecornerofavan, 
I saw him," he said. 

From there, Corpuz chased the 
suspect around the Grove Gallery 
and through the Grove Caffe.

Future of Broadcast Radio Discussed at Meeting 
• Main issues to be decided will be station governance, management, funding 
By Juon Snell 
News Editor 

Administrators and student 
leaders began discussing the future 
of campus radio broadcasting Mon-
day in a meeting characterized by 
all participants as being a positive 
event. 

A.S. PresidentJohnEdson, Dean 
of Extension Mary Walshok, KSDT 
General Manager Steve Branin, 
KSDT Assistant Manager C. 
Squibby Breyman, Associate Vice 
OlancellorofStudcnt Programs and 
Facilities Tom Tucker, and Director 
of Student Organizations and Stu-
dent Services Randy Woodard at-
tended the meeting. 

"It \VII a good meeting," Branin 
said. "In past meetings, it's seemed 
thai we've juII been told to speIk to 
someoneel8e, and nod1ing ha been 

Ale. tfyuIner/GuriBn 
Extension Dean Mary Walshok 
accomplished. " 

According to Woodard, the 
meeting WM preliminary in nature, 
and began the process of looking 
into the creation of a campus br0ad-
cast radio station. 

KSDT, UCSD's campus radio 
station, does not broadcast over the 
airwaves. Instead. its signal is car-
ried over carrier current wire and 
the Cox and Southwestern cable 
systems. 

Walshok described the work that 
must be done before such a station 
can be created as being similar to the 
work that has been done to establish 
a low-power television station at 
UCSD. 

As dean of UCSD Extension, 
Walshok is in charge of campus 
broadcast services. 

"1bere needs to be some kind of 
group, made up of students, faculty, 
and staff, to have a discussion about 
a campus broadcast radio station," 
she said. "That's what [was done] 
about the television station." 

According to Walshok, four is-

sues regarding the radio station must 
be addressed, just as they were ad-
dressed regarding the television 
station. 

"TIle first issue is governance," 
she said. "We have to decide who is 
liable and who is responsible for the 
radio station. " 

The other issues, she said , in-
volved finding a "mission," or pur-
pose for the station, deciding how 
the station will be funded, and de-
tennining who will manage the sta-
tion. 

"How involved students will be 
[in the management of the station) 
is what we'U be discussing," Edson 
said. 

Because UCSD Extension is in 
charge of all campus broadcasting, 
it would not be possible for an FM-

Student Leaders Discuss Budget, University's Future With UC President 
.A.S, President Edson, GSA President Fremont took part in lengthy meeting with David Gardner 
By Juan Snell 
NftItJ EdIIDr 

Student body presidents from 
across the UC system, includina 

UCSD·sA.S.~ideDlJohnEdson 
and Graduaae Student Association 
(GSA) President Daved Fremont, 
mel widl University President David 
Gardner on ~y in 0ak1and to 
discuss issues including the state 
budaet, the future of the university, 
and alternative housing on campus. 

Aa:ording to Edson. the meel-
ing1utedfrom9p.m. to 12:30 a.m., 
the 10ngest that the presidents have 
met with Gardner in the history of 
theamual meetinas betwcenstudent 
1eaders and the university presidenL 

Edson said that his view of 
Gardner was primarily positive. 

"I found [President Gardner] to 
be very sympaaheticlOward students, 
in contrast with the attitudes of the 
regents and the chancellor," Edson 
said 

Fremont, however, took a less 
optimistic view. 

"[Gardner] is what you' d expect 
the president of the University of 
California to be - he's amazingly 
political," he said. 

Still, Fremont said that it was 
clear that Gardner was "really on 
topoftbings," and was familiarwith 
various issues at all UC campuses. 

One of the prime topics of con-
versation during the meeting was 
the state budget crisis, and how it 
will affect the future of the univer-
sity. 

Due to the decrease in state fund-
ing for the UC, the university will 
only be able to guarantee enroll-
ment for the top 12.5 percent of 

California high school students, 
down from the previous Il'\Ilrt of 
14.1 perced. Acoording to Edson, 
Gardner is ccmmitted to making 
sure that the ethnic composition of 
the university is not altered by such 
acbange. 

"He wants to make the enroll-
mentcbanges 'ethnically neutral.'" 
Edson said, exp1aining that nlising 

" At the end, it sort of 
came down to [Gardner] 
telling us, 'Bri~r'€ this 

issue up is just sym-
bolic .... You want us to 

legitimize lesbian and gClf 
relationships. ' 

" DAVED FREMONT 
GS4 president 

just Scbolastic Aptitude Test re-
quirements or grade point average 
requirements could create a bias 
against some ethnic groups. 

Edson also said that Gardner bas 
clear opinions on different ways of 
adjusting the university's fee sys-
tem. Gardner was clearly opposed 
to one suggested option, that of a 
"sliding fee scale" which would use 
acomplicated mathematical formula 
to dctennine how much a student 
would pay for enro11ment, depend· 
ing on that student's family income 
and other monetary factors, Edson

"He sees the sliding fee scale as 

a psychologica1 problem, because 
baving some students paying noth-
ing to go to scbool while others bad 
to pay full price would probably 
bother the (full-fcc paying stu-
dents]." Edson said 

Edson and Fremont also men-
tioned the growing concern that 
middle-class students arc being 
squeezed out of the university. be-
cause financial aid cannot cover all 
students who lack the ability to pay 
for college. 

Both UCSD presidents also ex-
p1ained that Gardner was clearly 
committed to upholding the quality 
of the university, despite the loss of 
state revenues. One of the president's 
top targets was a UCSA-sponsored 
bill now moving through the stale 
legislature that would increase the 
nwnber of courses that a faculty 
member must teach over a tbree-
year period from 12 to 13. 

"He was very adamant concern-
ing changing the faculty worit1oad, 
and said he would oppose the UCSA 
bill," Fremont said 

Fremont also explained that he 
was "not particularly happy" with 
the UCSA bill, and said it was his 
impression that most of the other 
presidents felt the same way. 

Edson explained that Gardner's 
plan is to decrease enrollment, rather 
than increase faculty workload. 

In contrast, the California State 
University is taking the opposite 
approach, planning to cut faculty 
while increasing enrollment, Fre-
mont said. 

One issue brought up by the 

GuarcIan FIie PIIOIO 
UC President David Gardner 

presidents involved allowing les-
bian and gay couples to live in 
campus married housing. According 
to both Edson and Fremont, Gardner 
was adamant in his opposition to 
such a suggestion. 

"He said that the regents would 
never approve it," Edson said "Most 
of the evening, he kept explaining 
that the regents are a fourth branch 
of govenunent, autonomous from 
the tate. But on this issue, he kept 
saying that there are no [gay mar-
riage laws 1 and that the uni versity 
would have to follow the state." 

Fremont agreed with Edson's 
assessment. 

"It was an animated debate on 
the subject," Fremont said. "At the 
end, it sort of came down to 
(Gardner] telling us, 'Bringing this 
issue up is just symbolic. You want 
us to say that these groups arc fami-
lies. You want us to legitimize les-

bian and gay relationships .... ' His 
point was that he will oppose any 
such proposals." 

"I'm pessimistic on the regents 
ever approving such a proposal, and 
they definitely won't approve it 
while Gardner is president," Edson 
said 

In other subjects, Edson said that 
Gardner was enthusiastic about a 
proposal to model new minority 
outreach programs on Third 
College 's Teacher Education Pr0-
gram model. Edson also said that 
Gardner supported the notion of 
seeking a systemwide health insur-
ance plan for all students, and 
seemed receptive to complaints 
about graduate teaching assistant 
and research assistant workloads. 

According to Fremont. there was 
some difference between the needs 
of growing UC campuses, includ-
ing UCSD, and the needs of those 
campuses that have finished grow-
ing - UCLA, UC Berkeley, and 
UCSF. 

"Those campuses have different 
needs ... they aren't worrying about 
growth anymore," Fremont said. 
"But in general, the main issues we 
were concerned about had a lot in 
common: faculty, student diversity, 
and budget cuts. " 

After the meeting, Fremont said 
that the general feeling of the stu-
dent presidents was that little had 
been accomplished in the meeting. 

"Ifsdifficult to tell how much of 
what we said he took to heart," 
Fremont said. "lbe consensus af-
terward was, 'We didn't accom-
plish much, but at least he knows 
our opinions now.'"

Poor-WAR ~ 1lE LA Jew TFBC I S 
• Looking back on the Patriot Missile, journalistic fluff, and the Home Shopping Network 
By Greg Huflstuner, Copy Reader 

So now the war is over, eh? Not like you can reaDy teU 
one way or another around here. In fact, "Operation Desen 
Calm" reminds me of the day "Operation Desert Shield" 
became "Operation Desert Stonn. .. Once yoo click otrthe 
TV, tum off the radio, and fold up your newspaper, 
everything is the same. 

You can walk outside, throw a football 81'OWld with a 
friend, buy your week's supply of Mountain Dew and 
Hostess products at Ralph's supermarket. and cuddle with 
your significant other on the TolTCY Pines cliffs, waIdJina 
the sun melt into the horizon. There are no F-lSs enpging 
in dogfights overhead, no carpet bombings, no armored 
tanks rolling through the ReveUe plaza. It's just anocber 
warm, gorgeous California day. 

Of course, I'm biased in that I didn't have any close 
friends or relatives in the Pen;ian Gulf, sol waso'tobligated 
to glue my attention to the evening news broadcasts in 
moroid anticipation. To me, the onset of this war was a 
minor inconvience. I just had to get used to dodging fellow 
students symbolically splashed in red paint, having to flip 
to page 28 in the front section of the LA. Timu for any 
national news, and waking up to little ditties about "Sup-
porting our Troops" on 8-100', mOmin& show. 

But that was about the extent of my suffering for my 
country. The drop in gas prices down to IR-war levels bas 
got me 10 tickled that 1 didn't even mind the last time Ihat

couldn't see around the $ix-fOO( American tlag he had so

In the lag-time between the initial bombing ofBagbdad 
and the sbon-lived ground war, I put up willi my share of

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

America Was Blinded by Media Whitewash 
Editor: 

Now that we have freed Kuwait, 
it is time to free the American mind. 
Daily, America becomes more n0-
torious in its shielding of its citizens 
from the realities it commits on its 
own Purp\eMountain Majesties and 
Golden Roads abrtSad. 

How often must we read wticles 
with flowery language to protect us 
from the atrocities that occur in war, 
for example, using the words "the-
ater" for massacre, "pride" for ig-
norance of the situation, and "de-
fending democracy" for downright 
aggression. 1be disdain the govern-
ment and the media has for its citi-
zens goes unchecked for a nwnber 
of reasons. Much of the problem 
centers on using stereotypes and 
political cues that make the issues 
ambiguous and hard to grasp. 

When people who oppose policy 
finish trekking through the fog of 
infonnation, the government and 
media tend to ridicule these citi-
zens' argwnents by focusing on the 
arguers rather than the argument. 
1be per.inent issues are thus ig-
nored by focusing on the protestors' 
Birkenstoclcs, bow ties, and place 
on the p..Jiticalspectrum, rathertban 
the injustices occurring on and off 
our shores. 

In tenns of policy making, what 
has increased over the years is a 
strong alliance between the govern-
ment and the press, leaving the 
people and our voice in the political 
dug-out. 

This duo, a "nonpartisan" ve-
hicle, conveys messages to the citi-
zens catered to their own interests. 
Using Earth as the playing field, this 
blatant softening ofbUth only leaves 
our government batting America's 
version of morality and dominance 
wherever it sees fit with the people 
powerless to stop it. 

Although the media is associ-
ated with "liberal" members, their 
bosses still have the ''I'll scratch 
your back if you'll scratch mine" 
Washington attitude. This attitude 
has led to the safety net on diction in 
wticles and newscasts, and the bla-
tant censorship of the atrocities in 
the Persian Gulf. 

Because of the lack of infonna-
tion and the red-white-and-blue 
blanket over the majority of Ameri-
cans, we are left ignorant, misin-
fonned,andclingingtosafepattiotic 
ideals.

changing the wrongs that exist. Now 
that's freedom, the ability to alter 
that which foils you morally.

we afford morally and economi-
cally to permit our government to 
flip the hypocritical, double-sided

freedom, and justice instilled in our 
heads, further allow ourselves to be 
shielded from pain and bUth as hu-
mans far from our coast pay the 
price?

Environmental 
Concerns About the 
Persian Gulf War 
Editor: 

Now that the war is at its end, the 
difficult road to recovery must take 
place. I hope this war was wonh the 
bloody price. An environrriental war 
was waged which has resulted in 
monstrous ecological damage, 
damage that has been ignored by the 
Guardian. 

Not once did an article address 
the effects of mass oil spills or oil 
buming on the Persian Gulfs deli-
cate ecosystem. Instead, we were 
comfoned by articles headlined 
"Nuclear Weapons a Key for the 
Allies" and other articles dealing 
with everything from patriotism to a 
guide for anti-protestors. 

We as fellow creatures of the 
earth must talte into account the 
destruction we have created in the 
Persian Gulf and its effects on the 
land and its creatures. The oil spills 
and fires have been causing havoc 
on various sea birds, sea tunIes, 

fISh, stuimp, corral and the endan-
gered dugong, a huge mammal 
closely related to the manatee. Other 
animals are headed for disaster if 
the problem is ignored. 

1be surrounding environment 
will take many years for complete 
recovery. Hundreds of oil fields are 
still burning and it will take years 
before they are completely extin-
guished 1bese observations do not 
even take into account the long-
tenn effects due to spreading oil 
over the rest of the region eventu-
ally effecting the entire world. In 
neighboring Iran, there have been 
repons of "black rain," the result of 
oil clouds from Kuwait Animals 
are bound for destruction ifcleanup 
is not takenquicldy and effectively. 

The cleanup will be costly. Esti-
maJed figures are in the billion dollar 
range and could easily increase. 
Instead of pointing the finger at who 
should pay, we as world citizens 
must all pay. Some countries have 
brought extra oil-cleaning devices 
10 the region bUI have done little 10 
use them because of their price. 

Since their actions are purely 
voluntary. fl/1allCiaI rewards are Iiule 
or none. The Saudi Arabian gov-
ernment is having trouble dealing 
with the spills because other coun-
tries are expecting them to pick up 
the bill. How can one put a price on 
the preservation of the world? 

Nothing should get in the way of 
cleanup. 

Chester Cootaoi 

Another Ex-Disciple of 
The Church of Christ 
Editor: 

After all the reasons have been 
reasoned,andtheexplanationshave 
been offered, the San DiegoChurch 
of Christ will continue to recruit, 
and some UCSD students will join 
it.l wanttospeakout and be counted, 
however futile this may be, as an-
other one hurt by the San Diego 
Church of Christ. 

I was intensely "discipled" by 
two of the members fora month and 
a half before I left the group. I hate 
what they did to me, and what they 
continue to do today. I despise the 
group and hope for its destruction. 

Count me in as another voice 
against the San Diego Clturch of 
Christ.

away from 

I left the car and walked with a group of UCSD 
students to the entrance of Rancho San Juan Bosco. 
Once there, 50 or so children and teena~ers, for whom 
the Rancho is home, swarmed around us. The group 
quickly dispersed as reunited friends hugged and 
chatted. As a newcomer and non-Spanish speaker. I 
tried to hang back from the throng but found myself 
drawn in and trying to make 
aquaintances using my pitiful 
Spanish. But I didn't feel 
akward or unwelcome. 1bc: 
Rancho tries to make everyone 
feel at home. 

Rancho San Juan Bosco, in 
Tecate, Mexico, provides not 
only a home for the young 
men living there but also 
academic and vocational 
training. The Rancho was built to be a solution to the 
overcrowded orphanages in Mexico. Overcrowding is 
a problem so immense that pre-teenagers are turned 
down to make room for younger children. 

The residents of Rancho San Juan Bosco take on 
responsibilities that are not common to people of their 
age. They built their own dormitories, raise livestock, 
farm, and perform vocational work in carpentry and 
auto mechanics to support the home. One of the main 
goals here is to give the boys enough ttaining to 
survive on their own when they leave the Rancho. 
UCSD students come to Tecate once a month not only 
to support the Rancho with food and c10dling but also 
to exchange in friendship and education.

arsenals, from all the panicipants on 
the "winning team," to perhaps the 
"losing team" as well. And fmally, 
Bush has virtually guaranteed him-
self another four years of govern-
ment service. 

Of course, Bush will have to 
dump Quayle along the way, but 
more than one person has speculated 
that Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman 
Colin Powell could be his replace-
ment Now that would be a truly 
shrewd political move. Can you 
imagine the Republican party 
boasting of its success in elevating 
the first black man to the White 
House? I can hear Jesse Jackson 
groaning from here. 

But in looking at this whole af-
fair,l believe the actions of the "evil 
dictator"were the least surprising of 
all. How could people have been 
shocked by reports of Imqi tanks 
opening fire after feigning surren-
der? Or the Scud attacks on Israel? 
Or the dumping of millions of gal-
lons of oil into the Persian Gulf] Or 
the torching of Kuwaiti oil wells? 

You see, Saddam Hussein 
couldn't stroll freely around the 
streets of Baghdad or have a nice 
picnic dinner while serenely 
watching the sunset He was at war. 
And, from early accounts of the 
bombings, he must have known that 

the allied forces were doing the "Icky 
Shuffle" all over his country. So he 
tried every trick in the war manual. 
The shifting of civilians to a previ-
ously-identified military bunker was 
sheer brilliance from a propaganda 
standpoint I'm also sure that we 
will later find out that many of the 
international bomb scares, like the 
attempt on British Prime Minister 
Jolm Major's life. were not the re-
sult oflocal disputes, but of Middle 
Eastern terrorist attacks. Chalk one 
up for our team of information con-
trollers. 

As for the theory that Hussein is 
plain loony, I believe that the Iraqi 
dictator's actions stem more from 
his pride than his level of sanity. 
President Bush's deadlines and 
cease-fire demands were carefully 
crafted to trap Hussein into fighting 
this war on our terms, not his. Our 
president was in rare form when it 
carne to limiting Hussein to the 
choice between military defeat or 
international and domestic humili-
ation. In the end, Hussein could 
only hope that his national army 
would remain loyal to his regime. 
But history has always shown that 
in a pinch, the everyday Joe is more 
interested in a three-course meal 
than in protecting a bunch of sand 
dunes. 

To me, the only surprising thing 
was Hussein's restraint in using 
chemical weapons. Perhaps they

RADIO 
ContInued from .-ge 3 
broadcasting KSDT to operate under the 
auspices of the AS. Instead, it would have to 
operate from some sort of IIWllIgClDCnt 
structure based under Walshok. 

Edson worts for KSDTLicense, But Failure Could Mean Trouble 
• President says he'd cut station's funding if it didn't get FCC approval 

According to Edson, one of the possible 
models forlIl8llllling thestarlon would involve 
the creation of I University BI'OIdcMt Ser-
vices Board to oversee both the radio and 
television stations. 

But the board would not actually manage 
the stations, he explained 

Walshok emphasized that the creation of 
an overseeing board would noc nocessarily 
limit student panicipation. 

'1bis doesn't rule out 8 high level of 
student involvement," Walsholc said. 

Breyman, who has been steppinl up 
KSDT's efforts to broadcast over the air-
waves, said that he felt positive about the 
results of the meeting. Healsoexprtsscd hope 
that KSDT would be able to manage the over-
the-air station. 

"We would like to convince [the expected 
broadcast supervising body) thai KSDT is the 
right group to manage the radio station," 
Breyman said.

WbiIe Edson hils, in the words of the 
station's assistant manaaer c. Squibby 
Breyman, "busted his ass" for KSDT, 
Edson also said thai he would advocate the 
removal of all KSDT fundin& if it bec8me 
apparent that the station would never

Walshok agreed that it would take time for 
any new radio station to come on-line, citing 
her experience with the television station. 

Branin said that working under a broadcast 
committee would be a "good trade-off' for 
KSOT because the station would be able 10

said. "That would be in 
direct competition with the 
television. .. 

The ideal would be to cade after wort on the television station is c0m-
pleted, according to 
Edsoo. the participants in 
the meeting said that a 
broadcast radio station 
could be a reality long be-
fore the year 2000. 

"II took us over two years to get the license 
for clw1nel 35 and the permit to put an an-
tema up on the tower, .. she said. "Radio could 
take some time." 

According to Edson. the meeting produced 
the possibility that the new station would be 
musically oriented, unlike the television sta-
lion, which will feature research and public 
service programming. 

"Originally, the radio stalion would have 
been research-oriented," Edson said. "As it 
turned out, [having the station be music-
oriented) would be more acceptable .. . that 
way, it wouldn't compete with the campus 
television station." 

"We were under the 
impression thai [Walsholc 
and other administrators) 
would want public affairs 
programming, like the 'IV 
station, when in fact they 
don't want competition," 
Branin said. "The ideal

The UCSD GIW"dian Tbunday, March 1., 1991 

IRELAND: Keane speaks on rights 
ContInued from pege 11 
cept of self-determination is the 
process whereby an oppreued 
groupdemandlandcreaaeaiuown 
rights radJcr than beiDa pnted 
those rights by III oppreuor. To 
Keane, this concept applies not 
only to the citizens of Ireland, but 
to women in general. 

"JustIS religion is used asa tool 
to kccpthe Iri&hdown ..• a wonwt'lt-
body has been used against her," 
Keane said. 

Keanesces political activism as 
the only remedy against the soci-
etal. cultural, and traditional cur-
rents that keep women oppressed. 

"Everything is politics," &aid 
Keane, who was born in Ireland 
and raised in Huntington Beach by 
Irish Nationalist parents. "We had 
some activism in the house." 

Keane credits her parents for 
instilling in her the desire to study 
the political struggles of Third 
world countries. This desire later 
led Keane to give up the comfons 
of a suburban, Southern California 
Ii festyle in exchange fora life filled 
with hunger strikes, attacks on 
pornography, education, and pub-
lications about the strifes of women 
who bear the brunt of poverty and 
political struggle in Ireland. 

"As a student at Golden Sute 
Community college, I got involved 
in the organizing of support groups 
[for Third World countries] ... 00-
ing to El Salvador and seeing the 
conditions there and then looking 
at my own country, it was easy to 
see the analogies," Keane said. "I 
knew that the SiM Fein existed, 
but I dido'l know much about it In 
the support groups, I got very in-
terested in reading the history and 
happenings; and, it ShUCk me IS an 
Irish person to go back to my own 
county and see my role in the 
struggle." 

Keane, the single parent of a 
six-year-old daughler, left for Ire-
land in 1982, and took over as head 
oftheWornen'sDepanmentofthe 
Sinn Fein over three years ago. 

For a woman whose agenda in-
cludes education through interna-
tional women's conferences, fights 
for reproductive rights and fighting 
against arbitrary and dehumaniz-
ing strip searches and seizures for 
both women and men, one would 
assume that her definition of po-

Jonsson. 

"I have always been interested 
in primitive navigation, and get-
ting a hold of old books about 
Polynesian explorers in the Pacific 
is very difficult. But the special 
collections has it aIL It is much 
easier to look through the books 
and see if I need them, rather to 
have to order them from different 
places," he said. 

According to Claassen, the 
special collections also houses the 
largest collection in the world of 
monographs, pamphlets, and 
newspapers from Spain's Second 
Republic and the Spanish Civil 
War of 1936 to 1939 in what is 
called the Southworth Collection. 

'"The collection is so special 
because its material is ephemeral. 
Many of the pamphlets were 
printed WIder duress, while many 
others did not survive. It is a won-
der that what we have did survive. 
This collection is especially useful 
to scholars because we have such a

as her own involvement. 

However, IICCOrding to Keane, 
"[The greaJCSt] political involve-
ment is looking at your own life 
mel being involved in aDy issue 
that is important to you. which is 
affec:tina your life, and wortina

.... CIIkunII iIIues, wMIeYeF the 
issue. looking at your lihWion, 
seeing it for what it is, aeein, what 
needs changing (is activism]." 

As a feminist, Keane believes 
in O(I~litv for ,he l'f"'\: !t. hut she 
feels that the responsibility for 
bringing equality about lies pri-
marily with women. 

"When a woman talces a step 
into being active on whalcverissuc 
itis, then she begins to see thinas in 
a different way. I mean, people 
generally do, but a woman more so 
because women are more op-
pressed personally and politically," 

critical mass of infonnation in one 
place. thus making people's re-
search a lot easier," explained 
Claassen. 

Special collection's archives 
also include modem and contem-
porary poetry published since 1945. 
This collection is called the Archive 
for New Poetry, and it includes 
published materials, as well as per-
sonal papers and manuscripts of 
notable poets. Some of these are 
hand-written rough drafts of fa-
mous works that provide an un-
usual look at the writing process. 
Among them are poetry and papers 
from poets such as Jerome 
Rothenberg, chair of the UCSD 
Visual Arts Department, Paul 
Blackburn, and other major con-
temporary poets. Furthennore, the 
library has recently acquired the 
papen of Leland Hickman, a dis-
tinguished Los Angeles writer best 
known for his novel GrtOI Slavt 
LauSuilt. 

Another special collection is the 
Gastronomy Collection (gas-
tronomy is the an and science of 
good eating), which is not one of 

According to Keane, men will 
not be the majorplayers in the fight 
for women's rights because, "a lot 
of men have Ieamed to say all the 
riabt thinp, but the way they carry 
out Ibcirroles you see they haven't 
really chMIacd at all." 

Keane is quick to point out that 
she is not beinl sexist in stating 
Ibis. but NIWCS that the oppressor 
cannot pant power, that it baa to 
be takeA by the oppressed. It is 
with this statement that she criti-
cizes Margaret Thatcher. 

"Thatcher does no,h' ng for 
women. Just because you are a 
woman in a leadership position 
doesn't mean you are going to do 
anything for your pnder. A lot of 
women don't see any problem with 
equality because they are in the 
same position IS men. You can't 
just be a woman, you have to be a 
feminist. That's the difference," 
she said. 

the largest, but is beginning to grow, 
explained Claassen. This collec-
tion is divided between Radcliffe 
College's Schlesinger Library and 
UCSD's special collections. While 
books and manuscripts concern-
ing European gastronomy went to 
Radcliffe, UCSD acquired the first 
collection of Pacific Rim and His-
panic cuisine. 

According to Claassen, many of 
these books will complement the 
library's collections on Pacific 
Voyages in the Hill Collection. 

According to Claassen, the 
special collections acquires its 
collections through antiquarian 
book dealers, and by circulating 
want lists to appropriate dealers. 

"Oftentimes," she said, "since 
our reputation is really known, we 
are given gifts, such as the Hill 
Collection, the Don Cameron 
Allen and Whitfield Baldwin Re-
naissance Collection, and the re-
cently recieved Gastronomy Col-
lection. That is our favorite way of 
acquiring new collections. It is 
mainly through the gifts that our 
collections grow."

be precise, it is the 63rd annual awards

orgy of expensive couture, bimboid 
speeches, and ego overload, aJ1 beamed live 
around the world to a billion people in 19 
countries. 

Like an oJd MGM classic, the night 
promises "more stars than there are in 
Heaven." It proves an irresistable chance to 
stargaze at the penn anent tans and smHes of 
the celebrities arriving at the Shrine Audito-
rium in downtown L.A. Indeed, this often 
proves to be one of the town's most 
eagerly-awaited events.

Mobbing the Music Scene 
By Daniel L, Calvi 
Guardian Reporter 

"It ' s rainin'. It' s wun-duh-ful, I 
mean it's wun-duh-ful fub Cali-
fomia." Carlton Smith's mid-
Westem drawl is wonderfully 
friendly, charming, and without 
pretense as he reflects on the 
change in the weather that is so 
unusual for Southem Califomia. 
"I'm sure it ' s not enough to do 
any thin', but it's good fuh the 
plants." 

The stormy weather does noth-
ing for the bad telephone connec-
tion and, although Smith is sitting 
comfortable at the Warner Bros. 
office in Burbank, he sounds as far 
away as Columbus, Ohio, his 
band's hometown. His band, Royal 
Crescent Mob, is in Los Angeles 
finishing up the video for 
"Time bomb," the second single 
from their second major release, 
Midnight Rose's, on Warner's Sire 
label. The group is also busy pre-
paring for a tour beginning in 
March to support the new album, 
But Royal Crescent Mob, with their 
strongest following east of the 
Mississippi, wants to win an audi-
ence here without necessarily try-
ing to fit into the trend ofthe Hol-
lywood-style Glam and Metal 
scene. 

.. It's a very difficult scene to 
break in-tab," Smith explains. 
"There's a lot of pretentiousness 
going on out here." Smith seems 
neither pretentious nor trendy. 

The former child-actor who 
majored in English at Kentucky 

Stale University is, however, very 
prepared for his interview. 

Smith has plenty to say about 
Royal Crescent Mob and their new 
record, but some of his answers 
and responses are so eloquent they 
seem rehearsed or fed to him by his 
"prompter," who he refers to when 
asked about a producer on their 
previous album, Spin The World. 
Smith explains that he thinks it is 
"preny cool" that this group of 

" They don't go out of 
their way to "pick out 
a set of clothes or ... 

all wear black 
leather. " 

" CARLTON SMITH 
Royal Crescent Mob 

musicians "have found a way to 
work together and, at the same 
time, maintain [their) individual-
ity. "Responses like this and a polite 
"beg your pardon?" here and there 
are laced with "ya knows" and 
"cools" - the typical rock-drum-
mer lingo. 

Royal Crescent Mob has cre-
ated akindofhistory for themselves 
by linking the band with figures 
like the infamous and "unseen" 
manager Marv Diamond, whose 
name sounds as phony as the myths 
of underworld connections. 

When asked about the actual 

existence of Diamond, Smith 
compared him to "Charlie of 
'Charlie's Angels.'" Unseen in-
deed. The CD sleeve gives lim 
Ford management credit. The 
sleeve also has a "reprint" of a 
typewrinen leller from Diamond 
which alludes to incidents of vio-
lent outbreaks between band 
members Mr. B and Harold 
Chichester that once led to the de-
struction of a tour bus. Smith as-
sures that it is all true. 

While image seems to be im-
portant to these guys, don', expect 
to see one of the highly theatrical 
performances that seem to be the 
trend now with artists from Ma-
donna to Motley Crue. 

The tour that begins in March 
will be performed in mall venues 
like Bogart's in Long Beach and 
The Roxy in Hollywood, and 
probably will not feature pyro-
technics, huge video screens, or 
elaborate costumes. They do not 
go out of their way to "pick out a 
set of clothes or ... all wear black 
leather." 

Smith seems to relish the idea 
that they are "four completely di f-
ferent individuals," all with very 
different influences and taste . You 
might catch them slamming out a 
cover of Aerosmith's "Sweet 
Emotion" at one of the shows. 

The influence of Aerosmith, as 
well as Led Zepplin, Prince, The 
Beatles and 184,997 others is atthe 
core of their eclectic funk-rock 
sound. The grooves and jams on 
Midnight Rose's were the result of 

Royalty: Mr. B, David Ellison, Carlton Smith, and Harold Chichester. 
a genuine collaborative effon by 
the band in which each member 
had a crucial role in the develop-
ment of the music and lyric of the 
ongs. This was not the case on 

theirlastrelease, in which the songs 
were predominantly written by two 
members of the band (Smith wasn't 
telling whom). And whereas the 
last release was under a tight time 
constraint, Rose's was completed 
over a year's time. 

Songs grew out of improvisa-
tional sessions in which David 
Ellison, the band's lead vocali st, 
would often rap and rattle lyric 
off the top of his head. 

"This is the rap era we are in, 
but it's nothing new for us," Smith 

boasted. But this method of writ-
ing leads to what Smith describes 
as "band blocks," in which the 
entire band (or at least a majority 
of them) cannot agree upon the 
direction of a particular number, 
but figure that it's " no big deal!" 

As sure as there is a drought in 
Southern California, there is thirst 
for music that transcends those 
boundaries impo ed by the the L.A. 
music scene. Royal Crescent Mob 
have the potential to satisfy that 
need because they are doing some-
thing different. 

Smith was not impressed by 
L.A. the last time he was here: .. It 
washorandstinky .. . Ididn'treally

OSCARS 
Conllnued from PIcae H1 
memorable event in recent Oscar 
history was Cher's lransparent 
outfit that revealed a WOO where 
her knickers should have been. 

Tbc whole event is just about 
the most clever piece of marketing 
on earth. An article like this merely 
adds to the millions of column 
inches of free publicity that the 
ceremony has brought the movie 
industry over the years. 

But publicity and prestige were 
not the original intention of the 
award. Louis B. Mayer fonned the 
Academy in 1927 as an opposition 
force to the increasingly powerful 
and militant labor unions. 1bc idea 
of giving away a few prizes was 
just an aftenhought. Only five 
people chose lhe first 12 winners al 
a quiet dinner at the Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel on Mayl6, 1929. 
It was to be 33 years before the 
ceremony was televised and the 
publicity truly began. Today, 4,800 
members of the Academy vote for 
winners in 21 calegories from Best 
Actor to Best Animated Film. 

But even in 1927, mogul like 
Mayer had an in linct for what 

might appeal to the public. The 
very fact that nobody knows 10 Ibis 
day why an Oscar is called an 
Oscar merely adds 10 the mys-
tique. 

Mystery aside. this 132 inch, 82 
pound, britanium, gold-plated 
statuette is symbolic of a deadly 
serious side to Oscar night Behind 
the glitz, glamour. and aossip of 
the awards is a uoique opportunity 
to showcase 18 industry whicb is 
America's second-largest gross-
in8cxporL 

Since 1988, over $125 billion 
of investors' money has been 
poured inlO HoUywood's movie 
industry. To recover such vast 
sums, the studio chiefs need a 
steady stream of blockbusters. 
They cenainly cannot afford to see 
their main assets - the stars -
destroyed by traditional Holly-
wood vices: alcohol, drugs, and 
sex scandals. 

Big money has changed the 
nature of Hollywood. The town 
now lives byasober,early-to-bed, 
early-to-rise ethos. The "gel seri-
ous" message is reflecled in the 
huge campaigns the studio mount 
in attempting to "prompt" an 
Academy Award, or at least a 

ThcUCSDGuardiaD 

nomination. This year MOM's 
"The Russia House" hid 47 pages 
of Daily Variel)' and Hollywood 
Rtporl~r advertising. Ir,ultimarely 
received no nominatioos, while 
"Green Card" and -rile Godfalber 
Pan IIr' (both with over 40 .-scs 
each) fared little better. 

Winning an Oscar is one sure 
way 10 creaIe a blockbuster. When 
"Rainman" received ill Best Pic-
ture Academy Award, its box of-
fice receipts increased by 74 per-
cent In 1990, Americans actually 
went to see a tiny Irisb production 
when "My Left Foot" won in sev-
eral major categories. After this 
year's nominations on Feb. 13, 
takinp for "Dances with Wolves" 
increased by 40 perc::ent. 

Ah yes, "Dances with Wolves." 
Kevin Costner's epic Western, 
once most famous for its athletic 
buffalo. is now subject to intense 
anticipation over how many of its 
12 nominations wiD be translated 
into statuettes. 

Here is a rundown of this year's 
major nominations and - God 
help me - a series of rash predic-
tions of winners. 

BEST ALM: "Dances with 
Wolves" has had this one sewn up 

since its openin&. Tbc film luis 
won major Oolden Globe awards 
and abe new Movie Awards, in 
addition to storminl the box office 
with domestic returns approaching 
$100 million. For the Academy, 
this is an epic, popular film and 
one that favorably presents an af-
flicted minority. 1be voters love 
that - for the pasl few years it has 
been the elderly or disabled who 
have tugged at the Academy's 
COIISCience. It is now the wm of the 
Red Indian. 

"Awakenings. "''Oodfalber m." 
"GoodFellu" and "Gbost" really 
don't stand a chance apinst those 
charging buffalo. 

BEST ACTOR: Richard Har-
ris ("'Jbe Field'') was lucky to get 
this far; Gerald Depardieu 
("Cyrano de Bergerac") would 
malte a totally incomprehensible 
acceptance speech; and the Oscar 
for pomaying the handicapped has 
already been used upon "Rainman" 
and "My Left Foot. "So with Robert 
de Niro ("Awakenings'') out of the 
picture, you are left with Kevin 
Costner and Jeremy Irons. 

Though the scale of his film 
was vast, Costner's perfonnance 
in "Dances" really wasn't. With

awards already gained from the 
New York Critics and the Golden 
Globes, Irons is the definite favorite 
for his re-creation of Klaus von 
Bulow in "ReversaJ of Fortune." 
Thconly hitch to his wiming would 
be if DOt enough Academy voters 
have seen his perfonnance. If this 
is the case, look. for either Costner 
or de Niro to walk to the stage. 

BEST DIRECTOR: Kevin 
Costner will probably get Ibis 
award to mak.e up for losing Best 
Actor honors. His only real 
compeition is Manin Scorcese {or 
"GoodFeUas. "1be lauer has never 
won an Academy Award despite 
directing "Raging Bull," "Taxi 
Driver" and "The ColorofMooey." 
It really is a two-way competition 
in this category. 

BEST SUPPORTING AC-
TOR: Will it be the year of the 
Mob or the year of the Indian? 
Graham Greene is nominated for 
his performance as Kicking Bird 
in "Dances with Wolves," while 
Andy Garcia is recognized for his 
portrayal of Vincent Mancini in 
the closing chapter of "The 
Godafather" trilogy. The odds for 
each are vinually equal. Bruce 
Davison ("Longtime Compan-
ion), Al Pacino ("Dick Tracy") 
and Joe Pesci ("GoodFellas") all 
gave admirable performances, but 
Garcia's emergence into major-
league status will probably lead to 
winning this Oscar. 

BEST SUPPORTING AC-
TRESS: Much as millions would 
love to see it, Julia Robens really 
doesn't stand much chance for her 
performance in "Pretty Woman." 
Look for Whoopi Goldberg to 
make an acceptance speech on 
awards night. If anything, she'll 
get the award for being overlooked 
for "The Color Purple" a few years 
back. As the psychic medium Oda 
Mae Brown, Goldberg held 
"Ghost" together as Patrick Swayze 
and Demi Moore wandered around 
with permanent looks of distress 
on their faces. 1bere is a sneaking 
suspicion, however, that Diane 
Ladd could snatch away Whoopi 's 
victory for her wonderfully over-
the-top mother in "Wild at Hcan." 
It's an outside chance, but the 
Oscars love these. 

••• Basically, the Oscars are a game, 
almost the Super Bowl LXIll for 
movie lovers. Soaring production 
budgets and huge promotion costs 
in HoUywood today has made the 
need for a wiMer vital. With the 
exception of "The Grifters" and 
"Cyrano de Bergerac," most of the 
nominations are bom from movies 
that have been great commercial 
successes. An Oscar, however, 
gives a film increased recognition 
as weU as revenue - which is all-
imponant when it is released on 
video, a market whose business 
now far surpasses that of the the-
aters. 

If "Dances With Wolves" wins 
in all of its twelve categories, it 
will overshadow "Ben Hur" as the 
most Academy-celebrated film of 
all time. The voters lend to give 
their highest-nominated film every 
award the film is up for, as "1be 
Last Emperor's" perfect score of 
nine demonstrated. 

Costner's film faces stiff com-
petition in many of its categories, 
though, and it is very unlikely that 
it will gain all twelve. Fortunately 
for "The Last Emperor," it had 
liu1c opposition. Almost everyone 
agrees, however, thai Costner and 
Co. will be malting multiple trips 
up to that podium in 11 day.' time.

Don't Just Say No, 
Say 'New Jack City' 
• Director/actor Mario Van Peebles 
discusses his 'call to action' movie 
By ctntIne K.aoper 
GuanIwI Reponer 

It'sstylish, yet street-smart. It's 
fresh, yet enduring. It's entertain-
ing, yet educational. It's "New Jack 
City." 

"'New lack City' means a new 
outlook - young Turk," said 
fo..1ar:o ..n Pcebl '-. dir<! 'WI a.,d 
star of "New Jack City," in a recent 
interview. "When I say, 'I need 
some New Jack cops to take on this 
New Jack City,' I'm referring to 
cops Ibat really know what time it 
is, know what's happening with 
crack." 

"New Jack City" combines the 
glamour of the classic gangster 
movies of the '30s and '40s, while 
focusing on the good guys, and the 
impact of the social evils associ-
ated with crack cocaine. 

New Jack drug lord Nino Brown 
(Wesley Snipes), leader of the Cash 
Money Brothers, takes over a 
community by manufacturing and 
dealing crack. Although it's a fic-
tional story, it's still very realistic. 

''This is a compendium of real 
characters," Producer Doug 
McHenry said. "Practically every 
scene of the movie has a basis in 
rea1life. There's a heightened re-
ality, but it's still reality." 

"I pushed beyond the artistic to 
get very authentic characters," Van

Peebles said. ''They might have an 
unrealistic or sUJTea1 background. 
bUI the streets [in Harlem] where 
we shol the movie are the streets 
wheR a lot of this happens." 

Although he had never directed 
a feature film, V an Peebles had 
directed episodes of "Wise Guy" 
and "21 Jumpstreet." This piqued 
the interest of co-producers 
McHenry and George Jackson. 

"These two jokers called me in 
and said, 'Loolt, you're already 
famous. [fyouscrew up our movie, 
you can always go out and be fa-
mous.Butwe'renot,"'VanPeebles 
said. 

After Van Peebles decided to 
do "New Jack City," McHenry and 
Jackson worked with him on the 
idea of an "adjuprop" film. 

, .. Adjuprop', also called 
edutainment, is a school of art that 
combines both a political message 
with a very stylized, artistic 
look ... It's a message, but it's also 
entenaining," said McHenry. 

The ftlm 's style, reminiscent of 
the social realism films of the '50s, 
created a visual contrast between 
the positive characters and the 
negative ones. Nino and his gang 
were shot in anificiallight, play-
ing up harsh shadows and cold 
tones, while the police officers were 
shot in natural light. The gang wore

The Scorpions -
Losing Their Sting? 
By DeNk SctIIIIbIe ... Tony Lo . 
&.IfWrltn 

It's always hard to watcb a band you ~w up with get 
old Monday night's S<:orpions concen at the San Diego 
Spons An:na was tesWDeIlllO the old adage, "It's better to 
bum OUI than fade away." 'The Scorpions' pedonnance 
was impressive, but laclted spontaneity and enthusiasm. It 
was obvious that the band had been througb the same steps 
many times before. 

However, the Scorpions were able to bide the impend-
ing effects of age wich much make-up, a smaller stage, and 
an assortment of bars to bide their vanishing hair lines. 
Evidently, age hasn'l affected lead singer Klaus Meine's 
memory, because during the show he cleverly used the 
exact same phrases he used for the live album recorded 6 
years ago in San Diego. Klaus MBIf18 - ,ockJ,,. /ike a Hurricane. 

Rocky Balboa Goes to the Rodeo 
ayDNnMFauett 
Guwdan RtIporter 

All right, maybe it's beller than 
"Howard the Ouck," but itcenainly 
makes any Rocky ftlm look like a 
candidate for the Oscars. Seriously, 
what kind of sappy, neo-American 
title is "My Heroes Have Always 
Been Cowboys?" 

The plot OOesn 't exactly enthral 
and intrigue che viewer either. 
Imagine someching near "Rocley 
IV: The Rodeo." Not too many 
movies have been made about 
struggling rodeo riders, but bun-
dreds have been made about smaJl-
town heroes who buck insur-
mountable odds for "truth, justice, 
and the American way." 

In this case, the battle-ground is 
a huge rodeo contest called 
Bullmania, where the winner can 
receive one bundred chousaod 
dollAR for spending eight seconds 
on Thunderbolt - the wildest bull 
alive. Who are they Iddding? 

The acting in "My Heroes ..• " 
was. as a whole, lu1cewann. How-
ever, it complimented the film well 
- the title was lukewarm, tbe plot 

waslu1cewann,~su~in 
inspiring the limpest lukewann 
emotions humanly possible. 

Scott Glenn (H.D.) passed 
through che film wishing he was 
Clint Eastwood,and Kate Capshaw 
gave one of her least impressive 
perfonnances as an embittered 
widow named Jolie. In a scene

where RD. and Jolie meet for the 
first time in years, the dialogue is 
delivered straight from the mouch 
- do not pass brain, do not pass 
go. 

J: "Didn't 1cnow you were in 
town." 

H.D.: "Just got back." 
J: "How long ya stayin'?" 
H.D. "I don't know." 
Yawn. In fact, several members 

of the audience did fall asleep. 
Perhaps it was from all the excite-
ment. AnocherequaUy-impressive 
line of "well-developed" dialogue 
is later delivered by Gary Busey 
(Clint), "I've been ruonin' like an 
ape with bis ass on fire." How 
quaint. 

Mickey Rooney (Junior), 
though hardly seen, is proof posi-
tive that there is atlcast one per-
former in this world who can act 
bis way out of a paper bag. Even as 

enonnous as "My Heroes." Ben 
Johnson (H.D.'s father, Jesse} aJso 
deserves honorable mention for 
trying to drag this film OUt of the 
muck. A commendable effon, but 
it was doomed from the stan. 

In fact, the best actors in the 
film weren't humans at all, but 
bulls. The rodeo scenes were 
gripping and almost made sitting 
through the entire length of this 
trite imitation cowboy drama worth 
il, supplying enough action to ward 
off sleep - almost. 

In shon, "My Heroes Have Al-
ways Been Cowboys" had it's 
moments - all six of them. Al-
though created by award-winning 
filmmalcers, this movie was a dis-
appointment from beginning to 
end. Rodeo riders are lucky; they 
only bave to withstand torture for 
eight seconds. The audience had to 
suffer for nearly two hours.

Clobbered

• Claremont romps to 
12-7 victory after an 
eight-run fifth inning 
By Rex Grayner 
Staff Wril8r 

Claremont's eight-run fifth in-
ning was all it needed to hold off 
the UCSD baseball team, as the 
Stags (11-S) downed the Tritons 
12-7 in Division ill action Tues-
day. 

Starting pitcher Brent Hansen 
(2-4) took the loss for the Tritons. 

The women are in the hunt for a championship. Hansen blanked the Stags for four straight innings, allowingjust 
one hit and striking out three. But 
Claremont erupted for eight runs 
in the fifth, seven of which were 
charged to Hansen, and one off 
reliever Denny Kubinski.

By HMIher Holtzclaw

It was a long drive home for the

The drive from its tournament 
at Cal State Stanislaus in Turlock 
- approximately eight hours for 
the curious - was even longer 
since the team bad to leave before 
the conclusion of the tournament 

and before the ftnal l'esults were

As it turned ouI, the Tritons 
finished in 13ch place wich a score

LumKeeps ..... ionsLow 
• Former Olympian 
hopes new work ethic 
means improved 
results at nationals 
By BrIan now 
Senior Staff Writer 

Sabrina Lum stared lucidly 
across the pool deck as she awaited 
her second trip to nationals . 

Like every other Triton, her 
thoughts were on Atlanta and the 
meet that begins today. Sbe knows 
that she is among the favorites to 
win in the events she will swim, 
and she knows that her team is 
expected to make a strong bid to 
end Kenyon 's six-year reign atop 
Division ill women's swimming. 

Yet, like all her teammates, she 
has few expectations about the 
week ahead. 

"I'm not going to get myex-
pectations too higb," sbe said, 
"because wbenever I do that, I get 
let down. I'm just going to do as 
weUaslcanandseewhathappens." 

A year ago, the sophomore from 
Monterey, California left for na-
tionals with high expectations. She 
was ranked first in the I 00- and 
200-yard butterfly events. But she 
became iU just before the meet and 
could only manage a second and 
fourth place finish in the two events 
- still good enough to qualify her 
for All-American honors. 

Despite her disappointing per-
fonnance, Lum felt her first year as 
a Triton was probably her best 
ever. One reason for that, she said, 
was the closeness of the team. Lum 
came from a very tight-knit family, 
and the team helped to fill a void 
she felt when she left for college. 

"We are just like a family," she 
said. "We are all very close and 
very supponive of each other." 

That closeness even extends to 
her coaches, and Lum feels fortu-

SWIM 
ContInued from page 13 
cans. 

The Tritons appear to be strong 
in every event except the distance 
freestyle. The relay teams are as 
strong as any in tbe program's 
history. And the UCSDdiving team 
is probably the deepest in Division 
m. 

Once again, the Tritons will be 
led by Catherine Capriles. A fonner 
Olympic trialist, Caprilcs should 
dominate the meet's backstroke 
events. 

A year ago, she set NCAA Di-
vision ill records in three events 
and, according to UC.$D Head 
CoaCh Doug Boyd. she should be 
even better this time around. 

In addition to Caprilcs, Boyd 
believes he has six swimmers -
Sabrina Lwn, Jocelyn Rothbard, 
Christy Parker, Jamee Couch, Erin 
Bak.ey, aodJenoaBanaszek -who 
will finish among the top three in 
their events. Despite aU the talent, 
Boyd refused to admit that his team 
is even shooting for a national 
championship. 

1bat's DOl our goal," he said. 
"Our goal is limply to have ev-
eryone swim to the best of [their] 
ability." 

"U everyone swims to their 
potential, we'll have a shot But 
we're DOt puUiDa pressure 00 any-
one to do anytbina." 

StiU. more tbaoever, the Tritoos 
will feel the pressure of knowing 

nate to have Doug Boyd and Darryl 
Swenson looking over her. 

"I have coaches who pay atten-
tion to me and care about bow I'm 
doing - in everything. I've never 
had that before," she said. 

The first thing her coaches no-
ticed when she arrived was her 
talent. The second thing they no-
ticed was her work ethic - or lack 
thereof. 

It wasn't a case of her not 
wanting to work hard. It was more 
a case of her not knowing how to. 

Lumcame from aclub program 

" If she continues to train at 
this pace on a regular 
basis, she could be a 

senior national swimmer.

UCSD swimming head coach 

that Swenson termed "minor 
league." Other than the pool size, 
there was no comparison between 
the Monterey Bay Swim Club, for 
whicb she swam, and the so-called 
"major" programs tbat produce 
most college talent At Monterey 
Bay, she never had the proper 
coaching to develop her wealth of 
talent. 

"Swimming for my club was 
really like swimming on my own," 
Lumsaid. "My coach really wasn't 
into it. I really had no one to talk to 
about my swimming." 

At the beginning of the season, 
the coaches made a concerted ef-
fort .to put ber on a regimented 
training schedule that would make 
her work as hard as she ever has. 
They believe they have done so. 

"Sabrina is not used to working 
hard," Boyd said. "She has trai ned 

that they are expected to compete 
on Kenyon's level. 

This year's women's national 
championship is expected to be a 
two-team affair. All eyes will be 
on the two swimming powers, and 
they seem to be virtually even going 
into the meet. 

"We're better than we were last 
year," Boyd said. "But so is 
Kenyon. Whoever swims well 
consistently will win." 

Once again, the meet will 
probably not be decided until the 
last day. But this time it would be 
no surprise if the Tritons came 
home with their first national 
championship. 

• 
Even more than its female 

counterpar1S, the Kenyon College 
men's swim team bas dominated 
Division ill like no othercollegiate 
squad in the history of sports . 

It has won a record II-straight 
national championships, and seen 
fewcbaUengers. 1991 shouldhoJd 
to fono. 

Most Division ill coaches bave 
already conceded a 12th title to the 
Kenyon men. Boyd isooe of them. 

161 can't sec anyone beating 
Kenyon this year," be said. "We 
just want to make an impression." 

He hopes that impreaaioo will 
include a repeal of abo second-
pbIce finish bI the Tritons have 
takal in five of the put six years. 

That could be more difticult 
than in years pMt. The Tritons will 
be rating a verJ young teanl to 

harder than sbe ever wanted to this 
year, and is reaping the benefits 
now.·· 

Boyd never questioned Lum's 
willingness to work hard. 

"She's a competitor who never 
quits. She'll do anything you ask 
of her," he said. 

"I don't think I've had a choice 
in how I train . I just do what they 
tell me," said Lum. who regularly 
records her workout schedule in 
order to maintain her regimen after 
the season ends. 

Even without training, Lum's 
talent has impressed observors. In 
1988, she was invited to try out for 
the Chinese Taipei Olympic team. 
She attended a tryout ession in 
June, and learned a month later 
that she had been picked to go to 
Seoul.Under Olympic rules, Lum, 
an American citizen, was allowed 
toswimforChineseTaipei because 
of her Taiwanese ancestry. And 
she swam impressively, winning 
her heat in the 100 meter freestyle. 

"It was an experience I'll never 
forget," she said. "A lot of great 
memories." 

If Lum continues to improve, 
her coaches believe that she will be 
in for even more great memories. 

"If she continues to train at this 
pace on a regular basis, she could 
be a senior national swimmer," 
Swenson said. "Beyond that is up 
to her." 

Swimming at the seniornational 
level would mean an opportunity 
to compete at the U.S. Olympic 
trials, a dream for Lum. She has 
made it a personal goal, and hopes 
to make senior national times at 
the Division m national champi-
onships. 

"[Boyd's] way of training is 
different from anything I've done 
before," Lum said , "but I trust him 
and I think I can do well at na-
tionals." 

nationals next week. They quali. 
fied only ten swimmers 10 the 
championship meet, and six of 
them are competing in their first 
year at UCSD. 

"We know what to expect," 
Boyd said. "We are real young, 
and even though ev~ryone's 
swimming real fast, we're just not 
ready to compete for a national 
championship yet. 

"Our goal is to make sure when 
we leave the deck after the last 
event, everyone will know that we 
will be a team to contend with," he 
said. 

Although the team lacks depth, 
it has the talent to make an impact 
in the meet's final slandings. UCSD 
boasts a nwnber of swimmers who 
are capable of winningtheirevents, 
including Travis Miller, Mark 
FabIen, Jeff Vance, and John 
Flowers. 

The Tritons have the talent to 
flDish among the top four teams. 
Where they will finish, however, 
is anybody's guess. Youth, of 
course, is unpredictable. 

More than likely, UCSD will be 
competing with Denison College

"No one knows who any of us

Continued from pege 13 
Head Coacb "Digger" Graybill 
said. 

A critical aspect of the Tritons' 
offense was notably absent against 
the Aztecs. 

UCSO's outside hitting, with 
the exception of Lamson Lam's 29 
kills, was inconsistent at best. 

1be outside hitting woes were 
partially due to poor passing. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Although the backcourt repeat-
edly made spectacular digs, the 
digs were rarely on target to the 
seiter resulting in difficulty run-

Bruce Williams and Lawrence 

Werner conlinued their eltcellent 
play by combining for 18 kills and 
II blocks. 

Werner has been a consistent 
force in the middle throughout the 
year, ranking in the top 20 in the 
NCAA in blocking. 

William ' emergence, however, 
has been a more recent blessing.

backcourt as well. He was espe-
cially in the second game when the 
Tritons turned the tide on the Az-
tecs, racing to an 8-2 lead. 

The Tritons clinched the game 
by winning several spectacular 
rallies. 

It was during this stand by 
UCSO's defense that Williams 
shined the most - including one 
play in which he dug two con ecu-
tive spikes. 

In the third game, the Triton 
stayed close to the Aztec , but 
eventually fell 15-13. 

Remer as UCSD cranked out six 
runs. 

Bul il wasn ' I enough as the Tri-
tons were held to just one hit fort he 
remainder of the game. 

The Tritons combined for nine 
hits on the day, including two hits 
each from Reis and catcher An-
thony Sanchez. Reis went 2 for 4 

This was partially due to UCSD 
straying from its success in the 
middle. 

Once again, poor passing was 
the story. 

UCSD anempted to stick to its 
hot hands in the middle, but the 
passe dictated otherwise. 

The Aztecs kept UCSD on its 
heels and forced the Tritons to 
abandon their quick middle attack.

Freshman pitcher KuJt Luhrsen, 
who replaced Hathaway in the sixth 
inning, threw three and two-third 
innings of shutout relief. Luhrsen 
allowed no runs, no hits , and 
walked just one in his fifth appear-
ance of the year.

etly.

number one position, wbile team-
mate Carla Nicholas was bealen 
soundly 6-2, 6-1 at number two 
singles. 

"They're a really strong team. 
The girl I played against had really 
strong, really powerful ground 
strokes ... especially her forehand. 
It was tougb," Nicholas said. 

LaPlante also noted the strong 
perfonnance of Catherine Yim at 
number five singles, despite a 3-6, 
6-3,6-1 loss. 

"She played well," LaPlante 
said. 

"But she got a little frustrated ... 
her opponent really played a lot 
better." 

At number four singles, 
LaPlante noted that Amanda Lynch 
nearly split her match after a shaky 
start. Lynch, however, still lost 4-
6,6-7. 

Thunday,March I., 1991 

Janet Whalen's 3-6, 1-6 loss at 
number three singles was littered 
with inconsistent play. 

"She felt frustrated during the 
matcb because she felt she should 
be beating ber [opponent]," 
LaPlante said. 

"I think because ii's right before 
finals, people weren't in tune with 
the match." Whalen said. "I think 
they were good," she said. "[But] 
we should've done better. 

"We weren't quite focusing," 
Whalen said, adding that she did 
not have a good day personally. 

"They're stronger hitters," 
LaPlante said. "They just put balls 
away more often than we do. 

"That's the difference between 
strong Division I schools and Di-

"They're just that much bet-

And Iowa was that much better

Nlen's Tennis Racks 
Up First Win Of Year 
• Tritons blister 
nationally ranked 
Rochester 9-0 for first 
Division III victory 
By Andy Gayton 
sr." Writ .. 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
has reason to celebrate, as it finally 
erased the ominous zero that has 
stubbornly plagued its winning 
column. 

The Tritons (1-5) not only beat 
Rochester University (ranked in 
the top 10 nationally) on Tuesday, 
they blanked them 9-0. 

The win marked UCSO's first 
Division m victory. The match 
ended the Tritons' string of Di vi-
sion I opponents. 

"Every year we line up tough 
Division I opponents," UCSD 
Head Coach Jon Hammermeister 
said. 

"Whether we win or lose, the 
experience pays off in Division ill 
wins." 

1beevidence seerns to bear that 
out. Even so, creaming Rochester 
is nothing new to the Tritons, who 
beat them 8-1 last season. 

"Rochester plays on indoor 
courts back East," UCSO Assis-
tant Coach Tim Ditzler said. "They 
aren't used to the outdoor courts 
we use. You have to account for 
the sun glare, wind, and tempera-
ture." 

Chad Morse, now at number 
one singles, set the pace for UCSD 
by beating Rochester's Jivan Datta 
in a 7-6,7-6 marathon. 

Chris Belloli had little problem

singles. The luck of the Irish could 
do nothing to stop Belloli 's over-
powering serves, as he won in two 
sets 7-6, 6-4. 

After stumbling in the second 
set, Vern Yarnell put away Sal 
Mauro 7-6, 1-6, 64 al number 
three singles. 

Recovering from a sprained 
ankle, freshman lohn Cross 
showed no signs of weakness as he 
bagged Ken Schultz 7-5, 6-3 at 
number four singles. 

"His ankle is healed up," Ditzler 
said. "But it still stiffens up, so he's 
playing cauliously." 

In other singles action, Brian 
Beanie downed Ben Austen 6-3,

singles sweep with a 6-2, 6-0 win 
over Mark Szabo.

PHD... 'S ANALYSIS .. . For some students, it's time to dust off the notes that have been 
hibernating in your backpack all quarter. But for the rest of us, it' s time to throw the 
books out the window, flip on the TV set, and watch the "The Road to the Final Four." 
If this year is anything like the others, expect the usual array of buzzer-beaters, mild 
upsets, major shockers, and lest I forget, Arizona out by round two. If you want some 
tips: Don't pick UNL V, don't pick USC, and unless yourl.Q. matches thatofa brick, 
don't pick UCLA. WEST: The obvious favorite here is UNL V. This team is easil y the 
best assembled collection of collegiate talent since the UCLA glory days. If everything 
runs as planned, UNL V should romp through the tournament. Problem is, nothing ever 
runs as planned. UNL V will not win this region, and could fall to a resurgent 
Georgetown team. Count on an early exit for perennially overrated Arizona. Watch out 
for BYU, but take Seton Hall. MIDWEST: A healthy Shaquille O 'Neal makes things 
interesting for sixth-seeded LSU, whkh should probably be seeded a little higher. 
Don't be surprised if the Tigers make it all the way to the round of eight. Teams will 
be prepared for Duke this year, but this region belongs to Ohio State. Everybody 's 
ready to write them off, but don't bank on it. Ohio State might go an the way. 
SOUTHEAST: I really hate going with a favorite - especially when I'm positive 
there are going to be more upsets in this region than any other. But Arkansas should 
win. Arizona State and USC will make early exits, simply because the PAC- lO no 
longer succeeds in this tournament. Watch out for Kansas, but go with Arkansas here. 
EAST: This one is easy. You can eliminate the top four seeds immediately. North 
Carolina and Syracuse always disappoint. You can eliminate Oklahoma State imply 
because it's in Oklahoma, and UCLA ... don't make me laugh . The Bruins lost to Cal. 
N.C. State has a clear path to the Final Four, probably by default. But it 's not N.C. 
State's fault that it was placed in a bracket full of chokers. PHIL says . . .

a three-round total of 223 - 79, 
72,72. 

UCSD's low score was turned 
in by Devin Thomas, who finished 
with a three-round total of 238. 

Wydra said that Thomas en-
countered troubles near the end of 
his last round on the 6,3S9 yard, 
paron Turlock Country Club 
course. 

Matt Stottern was second 
among the Tritons with 241, while 
Dale Abraham finshed third with 
244. Jeremy Moe rounded out the 
foursome with a 244. 

Moe's score could have been 
lower, but he was penalized four 
strokes in his final round for hav-
ing two extra clubs in his bag. 

Moe 's parent live in Northern 
California and brought him the two 
extra clubs at his request, and they 
were mistakenly left in his bag. 

Bob Knee finished fifth among 
the Tritons with a 251 . 

"We're deep in talent," Wydra 
sa id, emphasizing the competi-
tiveness within the team. 

Wydra noted the increa ingly

suited up. 

Maybe, just one more time, he 
wanted to hear his body go"SNAP,

• How much do spring training 
wins mean? 

Judge for yourself. Five of the 
top seven tearns in the American 
League standings are Minnesota. 
Seattle. Baltimore, Cleveland, and 
New York. 

The top team in the National 
League is Houston.

"We started off very cold," 
stronger play of second-year 
freshman Abraham, who has 
fought his way up the scoring lad-
der. 

" I'm very pleased with 
Abraham," he said. "For a rookie. 
he ' s played marvelously well." 

BelloH said. "Then again, this was 
our first time playing together." 

Due to a nagging wrist injury, 
Bethard hadn't played for about 
four and a half weeks. 

"It's been a while," Bethard 
said. "It' s real good to play again." 

sota loses Gary Gaetti, California 
picks him up. 

TIle wise men at Inside Sports 
are somehow led to the conel usion 
that the Twins will finish ahead of 
the Angels. Someone's wheel 
stopped turning. 

• Recruiting is out of hand. Ja-
son Kidd of Alameda (CA) is just 
a high-school junior, but be has 
every college coach in America 
looking like a dog with rabies. 

He got his first recruiting letter 
at the wise old age of 14, and has 
been called the next Magic John-
son. Maybe the colleges should 
think about turning up the heat a 
little. 

The nagging question is why 
break up the powerful combo of 
Belloli and Morse? 

According to Ditzler, Morse and 
Belloli were separated because 
both players are leaders and tend to 
dominate the court. 

"We're going to get a lot better 
results," Ditzler assured. 

As for the other doubles 
matches, overkill is an understate-
ment. 

Thunday, March 1.,1991 

Not enough pressure on the kid: 
"So many decisions ... UNL V ot

• Perhaps the most interesting 
fight of the year was played out in 
Philadelphia Monday when bowl-
ing baJJ Charles Barkley and 
hockey stick Manute Bol bad a 
little tiff during a PnlCtice session. 

That's like watching Porley Pig 
wrestle Big Bird. 

• UCSD getting no respect? 
Rumor has it that the San Diego 
State volleyball team that knocked 
off the Tritons in four games was 
the Aztecs' N squad. 

That hurts. 
• Len Dykstra? Yiles. 

Morse and Cross took apart 
Mauro and Austen 6-2,6-2 at num-
ber two doubles. 

Schultz and Szabo managed to 
win just one game in two sets, as 
Yamell and Beattie trounced them 
6-0, 6-1 at number thIee doubles. 

"Rochester's realJynoproblem. 
We expect to beat them," Ditzler 
said.

such as turbulence in the oceans and 
transport of pollutants in the atmo-
sphere and ground water as well as 
pattern formation in dissipative 
media. 

"They're [the Soviet scientists] 
not here in a vacuum. TIley're here 
because a lot of people at UCSD are 
interested in the things they're talk-
ing about," Abarbanel said. 

According to Rabinovich, the 
lectures have so far been very pro-
ductiveand he believes theexchange 
has made for strong contact between 
the universities and scientists. 

"I believe there are very good 

conditions for scientific work and 
study [at UCSDJ. It is a very attrac-
tive place for students and profes-
sors and I believe strong contacts 
with different universities in the 
United States, Europe, and Russia 
may be very useful," he said. 

Rabinovich added that he be-
lieves that UCSD is developing very 
quickly and that he is sure it will 
soon be among the "first team" of 
universities in the United States. 

Rabinovich hopes to return to 
UCSD early next year and plans to 
prepare a manuscript of books cor-
responding to the lecture topic with 
Valentine and Abarbanel. 

Rabinovich also said that he 
hopes the exchange program, funded 

NEWS 21 

through the U.S. Office of Naval 
Research and the Soviet Academy 
of Science, would be a "long term 
affair," continuing beyond its three-
year contract. 

These sentiments were echoed 
by Valentine and Abarbanel, who 
added that they hoped the INLS 
program would encourage similar 
exchanges among UCSD research-
ers from other departments and their 
Soviet colleagues in Gorky. 

As part of the INLS exchange 
program, a member of the UCSD 
faculty is expected to visit Gorky 
for three months this fall while plan 
are already underway for another 
Soviet scientist to be at UCSD for 
the entire year of 1992.
