After having their most recent 
issue rejected by two local print-
ing companies due to objectionable 
content, satirical campus newspaper 
the Koala still remains without a per-
manent printing company, rendering 
the future of the controversial A.S.-
funded organization uncertain.

According to Koala Editor-in-
Chief Kris Gregorian, Pomerado 
Publishing, which has been printing 
the Koala for over 20 years, refused to 
print the latest issue unless a particu-
larly offensive graphic was altered or 
removed. 

“[Pomerado Publishing] never 
actually liked the Koala, but they 
never really looked over people’s 
shoulders,” Gregorian said. “Once 
they did, they started asking us to 
censor images. They called us last 
minute and said, ‘We’re not going 
to print this unless you change these 
images which I found distasteful.’” 

Because of the printing compa-
ny’s request to alter the paper’s con-
tent, Gregorian decided to perma-
nently refuse to print with Pomerado 
Publishing in the future. 

“I find it particularly insidious 
when private citizens censor news 
media,” Gregorian said. “You expect 
it from government or public institu-
tions, but this is more frustrating. 
What would be the point of printing 
the Koala if we’re going to bend over 
to this censorship?”

Pomerado Publishing refused to 
comment.

The newspaper then turned to 
VQS Enterprises, a Vista-based 
printing company that was sched-
uled to print the Koala’s Nov. 19 
issue. However, upon seeing the 
illustration in question, owner Don 
McCurdy decided not to go through 
with printing the issue. 

“We don’t try to control in any 
way, shape or form the editorial con-
tent, but if there is graphic con-
tent that would embarrass me if my 
daughter saw, I would not run it,” 
McCurdy said. 

Though McCurdy ultimately

Regents Consider Student Fee Increase

By Kelly Pleskot 
Contributing Writer

Student fees could increase by 
as much as 9.4 percent next year 
to compensate for a crippling state 
funding deficit, according to the UC 
Board of Regents’ proposed 2009-10 
budget released earlier this month. 

The regents are discussing the 
possible fee increases at their meet-
ing in San Francisco this week.

UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez 
said the California budget cri-
sis prompted university officials to 
consider the proposed fee increas-
es. According to Vazquez, the fee 
increases would be in line with the 
higher-education compact agreed 
upon by former UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, which stipulates that 
student fees may increase by as much 
as 10 percent in times of fiscal crisis.

“In constant dollars, state support 
on a per student basis has dropped 
about 40 percent since 1991,” Vasquez 

said. “We want to work with [state 
officials] constructively on budget 
solutions.”

The fee increases would demand 
an additional $662 per year from resi-
dent undergraduates and $748 from 

resident graduate students, according 
to the regents’ proposal. The plan also 
requests $122 million in state funding 
to cover the growth in enrollment 
this academic year and the projected 
growth in 2009-10. 

According to Vazquez, if the uni-
versity fails to attain these funds, 
fewer eligible students will be able to 
attend the UC campus of their choice. 

Facing state funding 
deficit, university 
officials review plan to 
raise undergrad fees an 
additional $600 per year.

University 
Endowment 
Loses Over 
$1 Billion 

By Omair Qazi
Staff Writer

The University of California 
endowment has lost $1 billion over 
the last nine months, according to a 
report filed by the Board of Regents’ 
treasurer last week.

The university’s general endow-
ment pool was $5.7 billion as of 
Sept. 30, a 15 percent decrease from 
$6.7 billion, the fund’s value in June 
2007. Exposure to the current finan-
cial crisis remains the primary rea-
son for the loss in value, according 
to UC spokesman Trey Davis. 

“Investment returns are tied to 
the economic situation,” he said. 
“We have an economic meltdown 
across the globe.”

Although Davis said no specific 
effects of the loss can yet be deter-
mined, funding for scholarships, 

Housing Project Nears Halfway Mark

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

The construction of the Village at 
Torrey Pines West — UCSD’s first resi-
dential development specifically for 
transfer students — is approximately 
halfway complete, nearing the goal of 
offering an on-campus housing option 
to the nearly 2,000 transfer students 
per year who attend this campus. 

UCSD officials say the north cam-
pus project, situated behind Eleanor 
Roosevelt College’s dormitories, is on 
budget, on schedule and expected to 
be operating at full occupancy by fall 
2009. The $122 million development 
will contain multiple three- and four-
story residential buildings situated 
beside a 14-story residential tower. 

Rob Batt, associate director of 
planning and construction for UCSD 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Services, said some areas of the project 
will be completed before others, with 
the high-rise and landscape features

accommodate transfer 
students, offer yearlong 
rental option.

A sharp decrease in state funding with the possibility of midyear budget cuts has forced the UC Board of Regents to consider increasing student fees for the 
second year in a row. University officials warn the funding deficit could result in decreased enrollment, fewer ladder-rank faculty and larger class sizes.

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

A San Diego rally and march last 
Saturday against the state’s newly 
approved same-sex marriage ban 
drew a crowd of around 20,000, 
making it the largest of the nation’s 
roughly 300 similar events that took 
place the same day.

“This is not just a gay issue,” 
said Sara Beth Brooks, an El Cajon 
resident who organized the event. 
“It’s a community issue; it’s a civil 
rights issue. People want their voic-
es to be heard.”

Turnout at the San Diego event 
— which was double that at dem-
onstrations in San Francisco and 
Los Angeles — came as a sur-
prise to many people, including Eric 
Schiller, an organizer for the San 
Francisco protest.

“[San Diego County] isn’t the 
bluest region of California,” he said. 
“Perhaps because San Diego isn’t 
known for demonstrations, more 
people took part.”

Fifty-four percent of San Diego 
County voted for Proposition 8, 
whereas the approval rating in San 

Francisco was below 25 percent. 
Statewide, 52 percent of voters 
supported the measure.

Fred Karger of Californians 
Against Hate — an organization 
that formed in July to monitor 
Proposition 8 donors — said the 
turnout at Saturday’s event might 
have been related to the large num-
ber of local residents who provided 
initial financial support to get the 
measure on the ballot. 

One example of such contribu-
tors is Doug Manchester, owner 
of the city’s Grand Manchester 
Hyatt hotel, where Karger said anti-
Proposition 8 activists have recently 
organized boycotts. 

He added that many of the reli-
gious leaders who were advocates 
of Proposition 8 are based in the 
San Diego area, including the Rev. 
Jim Garlow of Skyline Church in 
Rancho San Diego.

“You’re at ground zero,” Karger 
said.

Additionally, incoming San 
Diego City Councilman Todd Gloria, 
who is openly gay, said San Diego 
Mayor Jerry Sanders drew local 
attention to the issue when in 2007 
he announced his support of same-

sex marriage because his daughter 
is a lesbian.

UCSD political science profes-
sor Thad Kousser had no explana-
tion for the event’s turnout, but he 
said it was impressive, considering 
San Diego’s “stodgy and conserva-
tive” reputation.

“So it does have an impact,” 
he said.

UCSD family and preven-
tive medicine professor Michael 
Criqui has been awarded the 
American Heart Association’s 2008 
Distinguished Achievement Award, 
sponsored by the AHA’s Council on 
Epidemiology and Prevention.

Criqui, a respected authority on 
the incidence and prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases, accept-
ed the award last week at the 
AHA’s Scientific Sessions in New 
Orleans.

“I am surprised and deeply grat-
ified by this honor,” he said. “The 
award also belongs to colleagues 
who have provided much insight 

and support. I accept this award on 
behalf of them.”

Much of Criqui’s work focuses on 
the occurrence of peripheral artery 
disease, which affects between 8 
to 12 million people nationwide and 
gives patients four times the normal 
risk of heart attack or stroke.

Criqui has written or co-authored 
many influential papers on PAD 
highlighting its high mortality risk 
and underestimated prevalence. 
He is also a member of UCSD’s 
Sulpizio Family Cardiovascular 
Center, where experts in cardiovas-
cular research, cardiology and car-
diothoracic surgery collaborate to 
address heart disease and stroke.

“This award from the American 
Heart Association is in recogni-
tion of the excellent work that Dr. 
Criqui has achieved for more than 
two decades,” said Ted Ganiats, 
professor and interim chair of the 
department of family and preven-
tive medicine. “Peripheral artery 
disease is a common problem that 
causes significant disability and is 
a risk for heart disease. Dr. Criqui’s 
work is critical in our treatment and 
understanding of patients every-
where.”

faculty and staff compensation, as 
well as various university programs, 
is provided in part by the endow-
ment. 

According to Davis, the universi-
ty is a long-term investor and antici-
pates future returns in the stock 
market.

“Ups and downs in the market 
are expected by any investor, so 
you plan for long-term growth and 
keep a highly diversified portfolio,” 
he said.

Documentation provided by the 
Office of the Treasurer shows the 
endowment fund had stakes in sev-
eral companies that were hit hard by 
the financial crisis. 

Companies including Bear 
Stearns, Citigroup and Lehman 
Brothers made up a portion of 
the endowment holdings as of 
December 2007. 

In a statement from the UC 
Treasurer’s annual report, UC 
Chief Investment Officer Marie N. 
Berggren said the financial crisis has 
significantly impacted the endow-
ment.

“[The performance of the endow-
ment] needs to be viewed in the 
context that the fiscal year ending 
June 2008 was the most turbulent 
since 2002,” Berggren said. 

According to Davis, the Office 
of the Treasurer monitors its invest-
ments and strategies closely, and 
benchmarks for the endowment 
are designed to observe the per-
formance of groups of investments 
in certain categories such as real 

estate.
Monthly meetings with the trea-

surer serve to evaluate performance 
of the individual investment catego-
ries and the general health of the 
endowment.

The UC Board of Regents sets 
the endowment payout rate — the 

rate at which funds are distributed 
— at 4.75 percent in May 2008. 
According to Davis, there are no 
plans to adjust this due to the long 
term nature by which the payouts 
are calculated.

Berggren highlighted the recent 
approval by the regents to allow 
for greater investment in companies 
abroad. 

According to the treasurer’s 
report, reduced investment in the 
housing market and a desire to 
diversify the endowment portfolio 
drove the regents’ decision, which 
will be implemented over a two-year 
period. 

In evaluating the performance 
of the endowment, Berggren said 
ongoing refinements of the various 
investments had a positive impact 
by reducing the amount by which 
the endowment fell, despite the 
negative turn in the global stock 
market. 

As of June 2008, the UC San 
Diego Foundation — UCSD’s inter-
nally managed investment program 
— drew 75 percent of its fund-
ing, approximately $266 million, 
from the regents-managed General 
Endowment Pool.

Fund Hit Hard by Ailing National Economy, Bank Closures
▶ ENDOWMENT, from page 1

Earl Warren College alum-nus and former A.S. Senator Dan Palay paid A.S. council-
members a visit at last night’s meet-
ing. Palay, who had been working 
on President-elect Barack Obama’s 
campaign in Missouri, handed out 
Obama-Biden pins to anyone who 
wanted one and gave the council a 
brief pep talk.

“There may be people in here that 
want different things for the univer-
sity, but you’re all on this council for 
one reason, which is to make this 
university better,” 
Palay said. “There 
are bigger things 
going on outside 
than the argu-
ments that go on 
in this chamber.”

One of the big-
ger issues on the table for discussion 
was the Resolution in Opposition to 
California Proposition 8, the coun-
cil’s symbolic resolution against the 
passage of the measure that banned 
same-sex marriage in the state. A few 
changes were made to the language of 
the document before the council dis-
cussed whether to pass the resolution.

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Kyle Samia came to the coun-
cil meeting to discuss last Friday’s on-
campus protest against Proposition 8, 
for which he was an organizer.

“We were just UCSD community 
members that wanted to communi-
cate that we weren’t happy with the 
passage of the proposition,” Samia 
said. “It’s never too late to make noise 
against what is so inherently wrong.”

He told councilmembers he hoped 
they would pass the resolution so 
that it could be sent to University of 
California Students Association and 
then to the UC Board of Regents.

“I think that for the sake of rep-
resenting the entirety of campus we 

should be content-neutral,” Associate 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Lana Blank said. “I just want us all 
to take a second before we pass a 
resolution based on our own personal 
opinions.”

President Donna Bean stepped 
in to point out that student govern-
ments have the right to take a stance 
on political issues and have done so 
in the past. Following her two cents, 
councilmembers continued to explain 
their feelings toward the resolution.

“Personally I oppose Prop 8, but 
I’ve talked to stu-
dents who sup-
ported it,” Revelle 
College Senator 
Brian Yum said. 
“I think that we 
should take all 
those students 

into consideration.”
All-Campus Senator Meghan 

Clair was among the councilmembers 
who disagreed with Blank and Yum.

“I think it’s our responsibility to 
our constituents to take a stance on 
civil rights,” Clair said.

After further discussion, the 
council passed the resolution. Samia 
praised the council for its profes-
sional behavior during the debate.

Revelle College Senator Katie 
Hall then made a motion to approve 
a resolution in support of construc-
tion of the Hillel House in the empty 
lot on the corner of La Jolla Village 
Drive and Torrey Pines Road, which 
has been barred for the past seven 
years by the La Jolla Town Council. 
The council passed the resolution.

The last announcement of the eve-
ning came from A.S. Speaker Jordan 
Taylor, who made a rare statement 
by plugging a free performance from 
the Jakes, an indie rock band from 
Irvine, at the Grove Caffe at 5 p.m. 
on Friday.

agreed to print the issue, he said that 
this would be the last time.

“If they absolutely needed it I 
would run the one issue but wouldn’t 
be interested in going forward with 
[printing the Koala] in the future,” 
McCurdy said.

Earl Warren College freshman 
Wes Field, Koala staff writer and 
designer of the controversial image 
that featured two women performing 
oral sex on the new Triton statue, 
defended his graphic as being pro-
tected under the First Amendment.  

“I think this is a blow not just 
to the Koala but to all the students 
at UCSD who look forward to our 
publication every month,” Field said. 
“I think they should be outraged 
because this sort of private content 
filtering might further censor the stu-
dent body.”

The Koala receives $1,900 each 
quarter from the A.S. Council. In 
order to meet contractual produc-

tion obligations for A.S. funding, the 
Koala is required to print three issues 
per quarter, and Gregorian is consid-
ering alternative publishing formats 
and looking for printing companies 
outside of San Diego to satisfy the 
terms of the contract. 

“Our current plans consist of 
talking to any other printers or 
changing our format, possibly mov-
ing away from newspaper to some 
other format, like a comic book,” 
Gregorian said. “Our most real-
istic option is to get it printed in 
L.A. Unfortunately, there will be a 
premium and we’ll be paying for 
delivery from L.A., which could be 
considerable.”

Despite the contract’s stipula-
tions, however, Gregorian said he is 
hopeful that the A.S. Council will be 
understanding.

“The production contract is 
always fluid,” he said. “It’s not 
because we’re being lazy, but because 
we’re being faced with severe cen-

sorship. We’ve gone through a lot 
worse; they’ve been really support-
ive.”

Associate Vice President of 
Finance Naasir Lakhani said that 
although all student organizations 
receiving A.S. funding are expected 
to live up to their contracts, they take 
extenuating circumstances into con-
sideration and it is unlikely that the 
Koala will be denied future funds.

“We do have a contract stat-
ing that they must print a certain 
number of issues, [which is] why 
we give them a certain amount of 
money,” Lakhani said. “Things like 
this have happened in the past and 
usually we’re not super strict about 
it if there’s a valid reason or excuse. 
This could be viewed as a reason-
able excuse [if] they still put out 
an effort to get their newspaper 
published.”

a career in U.S. Foreign Service, the United Nations (U.N.), U.N.–specialized

Additionally, the plan asks for $31 
million in instruction equipment and 
building maintenance. The proposal 
also calls for 5 percent increases in 
staff salaries and health benefit costs, 
as well as $228 million toward the UC 
Retirement Plan for employees. Pro-
fessional school fees could rise by 
5 to 24 percent, according to the 
university.

The UC Student Association 
has actively pro-
tested the pro-
posed increases in 
student fees. UC 
Student Association 
President Lucero 
Chavez said the 
fee increases will 
deter students from 
applying to UC 
campuses, as many 
will not be able to 
afford increased 
tuition. She also 
said sharp fee hikes 
will prevent stu-
dents of low socio-
economic status 
from attending UC 
schools, translat-
ing to widespread 
consequences for the student body’s 
ethnic and social makeup.

“It definitely can predict a drop in 
diversity,” Chavez said.

Vazquez said the UC system will 
offset the negative impact of higher 
fees by increasing the availability of 
financial aid for students in need.

The university will also seek to 
increase the availability of grants to 
further accommodate students strug-
gling to afford college.

Still, Chavez said the current state 
budget crisis does not represent a 
valid reason to dramatically increase 
student fees.

“There have been good budget 
years and bad budget years but no 
matter what, we have always seen fee 
increases,” she said. “It is a difficult 
argument to hear because we hear it 
every year.” 

Chavez said the university 
increases fees consistently, yet pro-
vides few improvements in offered 
services. Due to the steep fee increas-
es, she said she believes potential 
UC students will instead consider 

attending Cal State 
schools and local 
community colleges 
to save money.

“What the 
UC should be 
doing is holding 
the Legislature 
a c c o u n t a b l e ,” 
Chavez said.

The UC Student 
Association lobbies 
in Sacramento each 
year to advocate 
student interests, 
and will continue 
to lobby against 
the proposed fee 
hikes. It also works 
closely with Cal 
State schools and 

community colleges to resolve fund-
ing issues.

Earlier this year, the regents voted 
to increase student educational fees 
by 7 percent and the registration fee 
by 10 percent for the current aca-
demic year. The regents also imposed 
a 5 percent increase in nonresidential 
tuition for undergraduates to improve 
various programs and services and to 
accommodate for a rise in student 
enrollment, according to the UCSD 
Campus Budget Office.

the interior spaces will be readied for 
completion.”

Project Manager Mark Rowland 
said the construction team has met no 
significant problems with the project.

“We have been blessed with good 
weather and a good team effort,” he 

said. “We’ve had no major setbacks 
to date.”

The apartment-style rooms will 
be open to transfer students enrolled 
in any of the six colleges as a more 
affordable alternative to other private-
sector residential locations in and 
around La Jolla. 

In addition, university officials aim 
to use the housing as a way to help 
form a stronger connection between 
the UCSD campus and the transfer 
students who arrive from a wide vari-
ety of colleges. 

The north campus development 
will also be the only housing complex 
at UCSD to offer a 12-month contract 
to individual students, as opposed to 
the nine-month offer found at other 
housing areas on campus.

The living spaces will be located 
alongside staff housing and a variety 
of retail buildings, including a satellite 
bookstore and a cafe.

Though the economic slump has 
affected many construction proj-
ects throughout California, the new 
transfer project, due to its extended 
planning period before construction 
began, has had difficulties with nei-
ther the funding nor the timeliness of 
the development. 

“The economy for the most part 
has not impacted this project as the 
contracts and materials had been 
developed and secured almost 12 to 
15 months ago,” Batt said.

Students Association



OPINION

UC student fees are set to rise again next year and it’s becoming rapidly more dif-
ficult to exercise restraint in finger-
pointing. With a governor set on 
continually slashing state funding for 
higher education, a Board of Regents 
with nowhere to turn but the already 
barren pockets of its students and 
a state Legislature tied down by a 
multibillion-dollar budget deficit, the 
blame for this extended barrage on 
student finances could lie just about 
anywhere. 

Yet the player in this dilemma 
with the most clout over the financial 
future of the university’s already cash-
strapped student body is, without a 
doubt, our state government. The 
regents, while vastly well endowed, 
ultimately have little reach beyond 
the realm of university affairs and few 
options but to up tuition when faced 
with such massively inadequate state 
funding, as they must now deal with. 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 
the Legislature, however, command 
one of the most powerful economies 
in the nation — a $2 trillion enter-
prise strapped with vast resources 
and a constant flow of income. It’s 
hard to believe that nowhere within 
this enormous realm of capital can 
our state political leaders find the 
cash to fund California’s most impor-
tant investment: the education of its 
future leaders. 

Though this point has been 

repeated so often that its utter-
ance has become almost a reflex in 
addressing the subject of student fee 
increases, the frequency with which 
it resurfaces is only a testament to 
the fact that our government officials 
have yet to realize the importance of 
adequately funding public education 
at all levels. It won’t be until years 
from today, when the now invisible 
effects of our government’s inatten-
tion to the development of human 
capital begin to show, that hindsight 
will reveal the long-term economic 
perils of such actions. 

Ultimately, however, simply point-

ing out the civic responsibilities of 
our politicians does little to produce 
the sort of tangible change that our 
state now requires in order to salvage 
the integrity and affordability that 
characterize its public higher-edu-
cation systems. Perhaps it’s time to 
raise the sales tax, an option sure to 
be countered by fierce opposition, or 
perhaps Big Business or the wealthy 
should begin to shoulder more of the 
burden of California’s current finan-
cial shortcomings. 

Until then, we’re just taxing our 
students, those who deserve the most 
this state has to offer.

Sacramento, Beware: Our Pockets Aren’t Bottomless

When I was young, I never imagined that I would smoke a cigarette. My par-
ents smoked — which I thought was 
disgusting — those antismoking ads 
on television made me think cigarettes 
were for losers and I sunk away in fear 
after examining those grotesque, black, 
wrinkled, preserved smokers’ lungs 
floating in formaldehyde at school 
assemblies.

Throughout my days at Costa Mesa 
High School, as more and more of my 
friends started smoking (the statistics 
were true!), I held my ground, faltering 
only to half-heartedly puff a Djarum 
clove here and there at parties because 
in my own world of self-justification 
I imagined them to be somewhat less 
unhealthy than their whiter, less-good-
smelling cousins. Plus, they taste kind of 
sweet, so I didn’t choke on the smoke.

From there I moved on to hookah, 
as my friends and I discovered local 
lounges where 18-year-olds could sit 
for hours and puff away on exotic 
tobacco flavors like white peach, guava, 
lemon mint, rose and even prickly pear. 
The practice became even more com-
mon as we unearthed small, hidden 
hookah dens run by Middle Eastern 
businessmen who never checked our 
IDs, allowing my under-18 friends the 
opportunity to assert their hipness as 
they joined in the smoking festivities. 
All the while, I consistently told myself 
that hookah wasn’t as bad as cigarettes 
— couldn’t be, actually — because it 
didn’t come plastered with a surgeon 
general’s warning.

Then, one fateful day, I caved. I 
was sitting with a friend who smoked, 
and she offered me a Marlboro Light, 
which I accepted. I sucked it down 
quickly and from that moment on, 
my antismoking wall slowly began 
crumbling as I said “yes” to more and 
more cigarette requests, even though 
I knew in the back of my mind it was 
unwise. But I kept convincing myself 
that smoking one here and there wasn’t 
a big deal and that there was no way 
I’d get addicted. I was wrong. College 
happened, and, consequently, I ceased 
living at home. Smoking became easier 
because I no longer had to hide it from 
my mother (sorry if you’re reading this 
online, mom) and I began buying my 
own packs — Marlboro Blend No. 27, 
which isn’t as harsh and doesn’t reek 
as much as other cigarettes — telling 
myself I wouldn’t get hooked and would 
only smoke socially. Wrong again.

Fast-forward to now. I am fiercely 
trying to quit, but it’s hard. Really hard. 
I find myself craving a cigarette when I 
go on a break at work, when I’m sitting 
in traffic, after a meal, walking to class, 
out at bars with my friends. So I’ve quit 
buying my own packs and have gone 
basically cold turkey for the past two 
weeks, cheating only a scattered hand-
ful of times. But I’m determined to 
desist. And to all Tritons out there who 
still puff their cancer sticks, I extend an 
open offer to join me in quitting. We 
all know that smoking is unhealthy, 
expensive and essentially pointless. So 
put out your butts and enjoy waking up 
wheeze-free again. There’s absolutely no 
good reason not to.

Smoking 
Pretty Much 

Sucks, so 
Don’t  Start

By Coryanne Hicks
Contributing Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — For each 
week you dedicate to community 
service, the government will pay for 
one unit of your college education. 
Or how about your employer offers 
you a paid day off — any day you’d 
like — provided that you spend that 
day doing some form of community 
service. 

Better yet, the government is 
offering tax deductions that directly 
correlate to the number of hours of 
community service provided during 
the year. Community service any-
one? Oh, there’s one more caveat: If 
your answer is no, we’ll just take the 
choice away from you altogether by 
forcing you to serve your commu-
nity whether you like it or not. What 
do you say to that?

Naturally, most of us would 
choose to be in the first situation 
where we are receiving a self-select-
ed benefit from doing what is asked 
of us versus being forced into a situ-
ation we otherwise wouldn’t have 
chosen for ourselves. We are all 
free thinkers and we can all discern 
what is and is not best for ourselves, 
so why is it that our leaders seem 
convinced that they have to force us 
into community service to get the 
desired response?

Take, for example, one of the 
promises made by Sen. Chris Dodd 
(D-Conn.) during his campaign 
for the presidency. Dodd promised 
America that as our president, he 
would increase the amount of com-
munity service in our nation. One 

way he proposed to create the “first 
generation in history in which every 
American serves their country” was 
by making community service man-
datory for all high school students.

You don’t need to be an expert 
to see this plan’s great potential for 
failure. Mandatory service, reeking 
of good intentions as it is, would 
not be enough to incite the “lifelong 
sense of civic responsibility” Dodd 
was looking for. We can see this 
already in the high schools which 
have taken on the required service 
initiative.

A December 
2003 study by the 
National Center 
for Educational 
Statistics looked 
at the relationship 
between students 
who volunteered 
in high school and 
those who volun-
teered after high 
school. According 
to the study, stu-
dents who were 
required to volun-
teer in high school 
were no more 
likely to volunteer 
again eight years 
after high school than students who 
did not volunteer at all (28 percent 
of students who faced mandatory 
service in high school volunteered 
eight years later versus 26 percent 
who did not volunteer). So, not only 
are we wasting students’ time, but 
we are also wasting the efforts of 
administrators who have to work to 
enforce these policies.

It shouldn’t take even this much 
evidence to understand that manda-
tory service in high school is a bad 
idea. When you inform these already 
overtaxed young people that not 
only do they have to take (and pass) 
math, science and English during 
their high school careers, they also 
have to find the time to volunteer in 

their communities, most will hunt 
out the least demanding form of 
service and resent everyone who 
forced them into this situation for 
a long time. 

Sure there will be the few who 
find a calling during their forced 
service, but they will be vastly out-
numbered by those who want noth-
ing more than to never hear the 
word volunteer again. This means 
that those schools in the San Diego 
Unified School District that require 
75 hours of community service are 

not fostering the 
next generation of 
do-gooders, but 
rather are instill-
ing in our young 
people a sense of 
bitterness toward 
community ser-
vice and volun-
teering.

Rather than 
forcing service 
out of people, 
we should find 
ways of creating 
a desire to serve 
within them. The 
first step would 
be to increase 
the availability of 

opportunities for community ser-
vice. We should make it so that our 
community is bursting with chances 
to volunteer, so that it is impossible 
to be uninformed of exactly what 
community service possibilities are 
out there. We are already taking 
steps in this direction. 

For instance, at UCSD we have 
roughly 15 campus-based commu-
nity service opportunities ranging 
from alternative spring/summer 
breaks which give students the 
opportunity to dedicate their time 
off to helping other communities, to 
mentoring and tutoring programs, 
to the A.S. Volunteer Connection 
which provides students with a link 
to local community service oppor-

tunities. 
On top of these, there is also 

a variety of opportunities offered 
through several of our six colleges 
and even a few academic programs 
such as the public service minor, 
which helps students develop their 
civic skills while learning about the 
history and practices of public ser-
vice. These opportunities are a great 
starting point, but people need even 
more encouragement, which is why 
we need to provide proper incentives 
to encourage voluntary service.

Dodd recognized that a very 
powerful incentive in today’s soci-
ety is money, so he proposed giving 
tax breaks to any employer who 
gave employees paid time off to 
do community service. The military 
recognizes another incentive: the 
desire to receive a college education. 
Depending on the time frame and 
service you provide, the military 
may pay up to 100 percent of your 
college tuition. Why not apply that 
same incentive to community ser-
vice opportunities? By promising 
those who serve our community a 
free education, we would be ben-
efiting in two ways: first through 
the work done while the person is 
serving; and second by educating a 
person who might otherwise have 
remained uneducated. A win-win 
situation.

There is no reason for commu-
nity service to be a chore we force 
students to do. The way we go about 
extorting service from people today 
completely takes the voluntariness 
out of volunteering and threatens 
to leave us with a generation of 
young adults who think commu-
nity service is just another class 
you are forced to complete in high 
school. With the right opportunities 
and well-aimed incentives, we could 
have people lining up at the door to 
serve their communities.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

Dear Editor,
As anyone who has traveled will tell 

you, American culture pops up in the 
oddest ways around the world. My time 
in Ghana has shown me the power of 
American politics abroad, with the 
latest obsession in this country being 
President-elect Barack Obama.

I arrived in July and have encoun-
tered Obama one way or another 
every day since. On my first day, 
upon seeing our Education Abroad 
Program group full of Americans, 
an overly excited Ghanaian started 
jumping up and down, proclaiming, 
“Obama is king, Obama is king!” 
Later that day I bought a bracelet with 
Obama’s name weaved in the colors 
of the Ghanaian flag — red, yellow 
and green. One of the most popular 
songs in Ghana currently is “Barack 
Obama” by Blakk Rasta, a local reg-
gae star and radio personality.

So why all this hype about a man 
who is the president of a country thou-
sands of miles away from Ghana’s gold 
coast? The most common answer I 
get is simple — Obama is African. 
Although he has never lived in mama 
Africa, his father is from the continent 
and therefore people here feel that he 
will give Africa the attention it deserves 
and has been historically denied.

 Ghana is having its own election 

in December and everyone says that 
they should use our elections as an 
example — peaceful, democratic and 
fair. The world stayed very atten-
tive during the entire campaigning 
process, and waited eagerly alongside 
Americans to hear election results, 
and Obama’s mantra of “yes we can” 
was heard in homes in Ghana, Spain, 
Japan, Argentina, China … the list 
could go on and on. For the first time 
in a long time, the international com-
munity — and this means everyone 
— is truly excited about the next 
president of the United States. The 
change that we brought about last 
week brings hope for change abroad. 
As America takes a huge step forward 
the world will move with it, with high 
expectations and vigor.

OFF CAMPUS — The OPERA CAFE, a cozy little space right down the 
street from the excellent Paul Mitchell School salon in downtown San Diego, is conve-
niently located to pump out a delicious $4 chai latte before, after — hell, even during 
— your haircut. Look forward to a steaming, soup bowl-sized mug of creamy vanilla 
chai, flecked with subtle hints of cinnamon and cloves, and topped with more foam 
than a keg that survived a plane crash. Fantastic home-style service (free pastries for 
returning customers) — and a quaint European vibe leave no excuse to stay away.

— Allie Cuerdo

Caffeine addicts, decaf rebels and anyone simply craving a hand-warmer: Meet your 
new best friend. The chai latte heavenly mixes milk, tea and spices, containing little 
caffeine but loads of flavor. When done right, it tastes like Thanksgiving, butterscotch 
or J.K. Rowling’s “butterbeer,” straight from Hogsmeade itself. Yeah, it’s that magical. 

ON CAMPUS — Despite a spotty financial history, the GROVE CAFFE, 
hidden amongst the foliage in the Student Center, whips up a large chai latte for $3.50 
that will consistently blow your mind. The difference is simple but life-changing: 
Whereas other coffee shops dilute the mixture with water — resulting in a thin, taste-
less disappointment — Grove baristas infuse your choice of steamed milk with Mocafe 
spiced chai powder. The Grove chai stays full milk, resulting in a rich, caramelly flavor 
that melts right down into your stomach, the kind of euphoria elsewhere found only in 
an intense back massage or eight hours of sleep. Best part is, it’s never scalding nor luk-
warm — always at precise drinking temperature, so you don’t have to wait to consume.

OFF CAMPUS — Tasty is nothing if not an understatement for 
the burger “Pulp Fiction” catapulted into our pop-culture conscious-
ness. This is a mouth-watering comfort-food man’s burger — a juicy 
half-pound beef patty, nestled lovingly in a fine-cut-cabbage manger 
and swaddled in a shroud of flawless ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, 
tomato, red onions and Monterey and cheddar cheese, all between a 
butter-baked bun, light and fluffy fresh with a crust flakey and fragile as 
the gentle strip of not-wet-not-dry shore at low tide. A Hawaiian kitsch 
explosion with a worn-in surf bar and continual ’80s-pop CD rotation, 
BIG KAHUNA’S in Pacific Beach can’t be missed. The burg-
er and an order of Big Kahuna Balls are the menu’s best, but bring a 
friend, because this luscious combo of island goodness feeds two. And 
make sure to wear your best Wayfarers, for you will know you’re in the 
home of the Lord when you lay this treasure upon your lips.

ON CAMPUS — If the shitty 
speakers outside the indie offices of 
KSDT student-run radio in the KSDT student-run radio in the KSDT
Student Center aren’t enough to get 
you grinding, back that ass upstairs 
to the Media Lounge, where the DJ 
VINYLPHILES CLUB 
spins the hottest in top 40 and under-
ground electro around the clock (they 
also hose an occasional rave/dance 
on campus — the most humid mob 
of heetered Asians on Earth). Porter’s 
Pub downstairs hosts a slew of high-
school-style dances — sans decorations 
— throughout the year, including the 
PERSIAN DANCE, where 
Middle-Eastern spirit hands meet grind-
trains as long as dude’s ponytail, and 
the LGBT NON-SEXIST 
DANCE, at which bathrooms 
are rendered unisex (not to mention 
trashed) and even viscious diva dance-
offs can’t deter record-high levels of 
enlightened acceptance. If you do 
make the daring trek to the corporately 
tucked LOFT in Price Center, wafts LOFT in Price Center, wafts LOFT
of Windex and cheesy tots will soon be 
overcome by a euphoria one can only 
reach when defying the high-and-artsy 
with a body roll to move mountains.

OFF CAMPUS — Nothing beats 
another cheap, sticky HOUSE 
PARTY, where finding a new-PARTY, where finding a new-PARTY
doorway down which to slide can be 
an hourly highlight. But if the landlord 
just can’t stand for another decade-
themed shitshow, a bluesy heaven of 
sweat and sophistication can be found 
in the old-soul throwbacks of LADY 
DOTTIE AND THE 
DIAMONDS, who play three 
nights a week at various venues down-
town. A few 80-cent drinks at the Brass 
Rail in Hillcrest on Mondays should pre-
lude the real dance party: LATIN 
NIGHT AT URBAN 
MO’S, where salsa steps soon dis-
solve to remixed-reggaeton mayhem. If 
you’re in the mood for a good roofie and 
America is lookin’ way too tight-assed 
for tonight, try COKO BONGO
in Tijuana for a taste of SDSU Greek 
life without all the legal restraints; limp 
back home to the Gaslamp for a thrashy 
light-show at BELO, whose mastur-
batory DJs sometimes last until four in 
the morn’.

— Simone Wilson

ON CAMPUS — Although every dining 
hall boasts its own pile of flimsy buns and 
tired, limp fixin’s, the best burger at UCSD 
is undoubtedly the BK LOUNGE
(Burger King for the crude and uncultured) 
Loaded Steakhouse Burger.

Piled high with mashed potatoes, 
crispy onions, A1 sauce and a steak patty 
that extends well out of bounds, this juicy 
sandwich packs one hell of a punch — and 
the best part is that unlike Plaza, Summit 
and the rest, BK is open 24 hours Sunday 
through Thursday and late on Friday and 
Saturday, so you can satisfy your meaty 
cravings anytime.

ON CAMPUS — Stairwells have 
always been notoriously useful for 
indulging the mood — along with 
elevators and deserted lobbies — but 
Mandeville’s acid-trip GRAF-
FITI STAIRS might as well 
have been created solely for the sport. 
In the scattered shadow of vandal 
love letters, it’s like making your own 
dirty little part of campus history. 

OFF CAMPUS — After school, climb La Jolla Scenic 
Drive to LOOK-OUT POINT, Mt. Soledad’s 
sweepingly idyllic view of the city. From up here, San 
Diego seems more like an enchanted starscape, 
with thousands of pinpoints illuminating the 
city’s mass infrastructure and sloping hills. 
It’s impossible not to feel sappily inclined 
to cuddle under a clear night sky — the 
peak’s natural high is ideal for cheap 
dates and anniversaries alike.

BEST ALTERNATIVE TO RIMACALTERNATIVE TO RIMACALTERNATIV OFF CAMPUS — You spend hours in class, Geisel, passed out on your couch or locked in your room; your exercise routine at the very least could use some daylight. Brave the 20-something hotties and head down to THE BOARDWALK, 
where a three-mile path from the end of Law Street in Pacific Beach to the tip of Mission Beach offers endless opportunities 
to score a fit beach body of your own, or at least scope out eveyone else’s while soaking up some vital rays.

Besides a steady flow of walkers, joggers and bikers, the boardwalk also encourages all the groovers out there to get their 
’70s on. So dig out your old rollerblades (little orange cones a plus) and hula hoop, cue “Dancing Queen” on your Walkman; if 
you’re really feeling ambitious, try the roller boogie in cut-offs or don that bikini for a full-on hula hoedown. Can you dig it?

— Danielle Warren

OFF CAMPUS —
Tucked away on 
Washington Street in 
Hillcrest is BRONX 
PIZZA, a tiny eatery 
that wholly embodies the 
Big Apple: Italian knick-
knacks and memorabilia 
plaster the walls, the work-
ers are loud and rushed, 
there’s no parking lot and 
the pizza is, well, the fuck-
ing best. For just $2, you’ve 
got yourself a huge, gooey, 
crispy slice of thin-crust 
cheese pie, precisely heated 
to that temperature that 
almost burns the roof your 
mouth but you munch 
through anyway because 
it’s too damn good. Choose 
between indoor and open-
air seating, both with large 
napkin dispensers placed 
conveniently throughout 
— and you’re going to need 
more than a few.

ON CAMPUS —ON CAMPUS —ON When skating took a turn from old school and went swimming in 
the dried-up pools of a California drought, one of the sport’s founding ideals stuck with 
it: always run from the Man. If you’re going to zip through campus slapping all the pretty 
“No Skating” signs as you pass, might as well go all out. PRICE CENTER has 
some of the best stairs, unclamped rails, open space and decent gaps to make for a solid 
session. And while the Student Center is secluded, the library has tabletops and Gilman 
Parking Structure offers all the nostalgia of an underground, Price Center has one up: A 
getaway from the Man is guaranteed.

— David Harvey

OFF CAMPUS — There’s nothing like a 3-to-4 hour skate sesh FROM UCSD TO 
PACIFIC BEACH on an aimless Saturday. Get up bright and early, eat a hearty 
breakfast and start at the top of Torrey Pines. Cruising down the bike lane may feel a little 
sketch as the hill gets steeper, but with a moderate amount of foot-braking, you can ride the 
whole snake run without leaving your board. (If you’re riding on hard wheels, get ready for 
a violent foot massage.) Keep following North Torrey Pines until you reach downtown La 
Jolla, where you can freak out snobby restaurant patrons by giving them a sweaty staredown. 
Head to the local beach for a breather if you feel like it — there’s a huge set of stairs by the La 
Valencia Hotel leading down to the sand. Stay on Girard until it hits Pearl, then take a right 
passing Dick’s Liquor. Make a left on La Jolla Boulevard. and follow that for a few miles until 
you reach Mission. You’re almost there! Stay right until Garnet, where you can treat yourself 
to a Fatburger or a few fish tacos along the main drag. Bring your student ID so you can ride 
the 30 bus back to campus; you probably won’t want to skate home in the dark.

ON CAMPUS — There are few places at UCSD that come close to rivaling the stoner-
revered natural beauty of NorCal. Yet for those Tritonian herbal connoisseurs seeking escape 
from San Diego’s strip-mall landscape and refuge from the uncomfortably long arm of cam-
pus law enforcement, there exist a few beloved locales — the best of which hide within the 
jagged outcroppings of La Jolla’s distinctive coastline. 

Known simply as THE CLIFFS, the shrubby, wind-shorn bluffs above Black’s 
Beach have long served as a bastion of chronic expression and natural privacy for generations 
of UCSD’s most devout smokers. With the cuttiest crannies this side of Santa Cruz and argu-
ably the choicest ocean-view in all of SoCal, this pot-snob paradise invites the intrepid blazer 
to explore its every nuance in search of a personal smoke spot. Once found, it is only a matter 
of time before one is enveloped in a smoke-filled, multiple-choice-free sphere, soothed by the 
quiet roar of the Pacific and brightly-clad paragliders drifting just far enough overhead. 

One word of caution: the cliffs are prone to frequent gusts of wind, often rendering even 
the sickest of pieces absolutely useless, so roll yourself something special before setting out 
— and don’t forget to pass to the left. 

— Reza Farazmand

ON CAMPUS —
Let’s face it: If you’re sauc-

ing it up by yourself, you’re either 
a pathetic sap or a writing major. Embrace 

this sad truth with a dark place to sit alone and 
mix VO with tears: THE GROVE CAFFE’S 

HIDDEN PATIO. Directly above the comforting tinker 
of the Craft Center, these secluded, rustic booth tables buried in forest can 

help drown your sorrows without the bother of human interaction; a passerby or 
two may stumble near en route to their cars, but don’t worry, they’ve no reason to stop. 

Unless, of course, they happen to be fellow writing majors looking to pen midnight ponder-
ings by the glow of their MacBooks and the warm gold of a stiff Black Velvet. 

OFF CAMPUS — After the sports-bar facelift of Ocean Beach’s Arizona Cafe (now with 
stadium lighting and floors you could eat off) the best spot to kiss the bottle now resides in 
University Heights. After reciting poetry to an unreceptive audience at one of numerous hip-
ster-art cafes near the end of Park Avenue, drag your misunderstood soul to the corner and 
duck inside LANCER’S. Slide into the back corner and and order a $5 double of the 
house blend. Dim cave lighting, wall-to-wall blood-red paint and the crack of pool balls will help 

lighten the news that your soul mate is sleeping with 
her biochem professor, and when the jukebox plays 
Godhead’s thick, electric cover of “Eleanor Rigby” for 
the third time, mention of “All the lonely people” will 
be more than enough to prompt an eyebrow for the 
double-D in the low-cut zebra print and a shout to 
the bartender: How much for the whole bottle?

   BEST CURE FOR THOSE BRIEF               BOUTS OF
   POETIC        PASSION

ON & OFF CAMPUS —
With piles of multicolored 
grandma sweaters, hippie 
jewelry and craft books clut-
tering the candlelit corners, 
it’s easy to see why people 
feel at home in South Park’s 
Grove Bookstore. But on the 
first Friday of every month, 
the Grove morphs from cozy 
hideaway to full-blown arena, 
teeming with authors of all 
shapes and voices. Here, bud-
ding novelists (or enthusiastic 
bookworms) are challenged 
to test their brawn in the 
DIMESTORIES
competition, which offers an 
open mic to all those with 
enough chutzpah — so long 
as they can tell their story 
within the strict three-minute 
time slot. Despite loads of 
raffle prizes (which include 
mugs, scrapbooks and a 
venerated parrot statue), 
there are no winners or losers 
— although NPR occasion-
ally plucks a few for national 
broadcast. And fortunately 
for campus crawlers without 
wheels, Dimestories now 
stops by our own Loft perfor-
mance lounge every so often. 
Whether you’re hungry for 
some literary show or crave 
a real audience (or just a 
tasty wine-and-cheese plate), 
everyone gets their three 
minutes of fame under these 
nurturing lights.

Remember when you could 
run around naked, yell at the 
top of your lungs and win 
praise based on the merits 
of cuteness alone? While the 
days of unconditional adora-
tion have long since passed 
— replaced by fruitless all-
nighters and bitchy internships 
— there are some places that 
still cater to your inner kid. 
Case in point: the NEW 
CHILDREN’S 
MUSEUM in down-
town San Diego. Built to com-
pensate for the loss of visual 
arts in public schools, the 
playhouse features touchable, 
climbable, hands-on exhibits 
from local artists, including 
(but not limited to) shadow 
puppets and harmonica vac-
uum cleaners — the messier, 
the better. Drag along your 
little cousin or go solo; either 
way, it’s a damn fun daytrip. 

— Sonia Minden

OFF CAMPUS — Ever wanted to breathe underwa-
ter, or at least convince yourself you could? UCSD’s own 
BIRCH AQUARIUM at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography on Expedition Way holds over 60 
Pacific fish tanks, one topping 70,000 gallons and sus-
taining a kelp forest. More importantly, it’s a safe way to 
maximize the effects of those special fungi you downed 
with some orange juice — with all the plush, ground-
level, rounded-edge precautions that other intriguing 
shroom spots like the top of AP&M might not provide.

But if your dealer is lost somewhere in Mexico, the 
aquarium holds its own even in moments of sobri-
ety. Take your family, a date or your friends to check 
out the 13,000 gallon shark tank — but better avoid 
shrooming by that one. Cue “Jaws” theme.

— Henry Becker

WAY, WAY OFF CAMPUSWAY, WAY OFF CAMPUSWAY, WAY OFF  — It wouldn’t have been 
freshman year without those few sleepless Saturday nights 
in Tijuana, made possible by the smooth-talkin’, bus-drivin’ 
services of Hollywood Ray to any bored underager with $12 
and the wobbly legs to sprint to the Faculty Club parking 
lot by 9:30 p.m. However, if you’ve got some downtime and 
a pocketful of pesos to spare, Tijuana’s depressing desert of 
smog-choked taco stands and underage peddlers is only the 
smelly gateway to far spicier digs like Rosarito, Encinitas and 

the little-known town 
of TECATE (yes, 
like the beer and yes, 
there’s a brewery). 
The unsettling lack 
of coastline is more 
than compensated by 
copious tourist-less 
bakeries and an ador-
able town square for 
the most peaceful pre-
scription-drug scores 
you’ve ever made.

Fondue in downtown La Jolla is a stitchsta’s paradise more 
colorful than a king-size variety bag of Skittles. This effective 
United Nations of Yarn is packed floor to ceiling with just 
about every fiber, weight and luxury brand a discerning knit-
ter could covet, with a DPN-melting sock arsenal and easily 
the best lace collection in the county. Selection and campus 
proximity earn KNITTING IN LA JOLLA 
the yarn-shop crown, with so much wool, silk, cashmere, 
alpaca, bamboo, hemp, linen, mohair, organic cotton and 
recycled sari silk you’ll get a contact high, and a generous 
sampling of novelty, ribbon and baby yarns. But be prepared 
to pay Prospect Street prices for this indulgence. 

If you’re a crocheter or on the hunt for a pattern, try to 
make it out to Common Threads instead — its cozy back 
library, massive needle/hook section and hearty inventory 
(the area’s only Koigu carrier) makes the Encinitas shop a 
close runner up. And if you’re just fiending for some kettle-
dyed Malabrigo, rich and creamier than fresh summer avo-
cado, the prices at Pacific Beach’s Needlecraft Cottage deserve 
an honorable mention. Rock on campus knitters, rock on.

ON CAMPUS — It happens — a lot. You’re drinking in your dorm room 
when suddenly you realize you and your friends have been playing “flip the 
card over and drink” for two hours. You need adventure, mystery, intrigue. 
You need to conquer the great outdoors. What could be better than the cold 
air on your sweaty face and the open campus loop under your stumbling feet? 
But beware. If you happen to be a wee bit lazy in terms of coordination or just 
really enjoy skipping while intoxicated, do not — I repeat, do not — go near do not — go near do not
the OCEANVIEW TERRACE DUMPSTERS. There 
will be cops, and although you will pretend not to hear them when they bark 
“Hey,” you will not outrun them. You will be taken downtown and you will be 
charged $100 for riding in a police vehicle. 

So there it is: If you want to check off the memorable experience of get-
ting handcuffed against a cop car before second quarter has rolled around, 
stop by the OVT Dumpsters; just make sure you’ve got friends nice (and 
sober) enough to pick you up from downtown San Diego at 4 a.m.

OFF CAMPUS — A blind nighttime stroll to the end of 
SARATOGA AVENUE in Ocean Beach finds the 
most ideal fire pit in San Diego. It’s just far enough from the 
staggering Newport mob to maintain a private fiesta vibe, yet 
close enough to gather a small crowd of eccentric OB street 
kids who might at any moment dance across the embers, break 
out in bonfire song or lay out a sleeping bag and pass the fuck 
out. Bring some logs to burn early; then, when the sun drops 
and the lifeguards pack up, break out the pallets to hurdle the 
sparks up to the stars. If you run out of things to burn, you’re 
just minutes from a packed bar. If you’re underage, go for a 
swim or grab a midnight taco. In either case, this cozy pit will 
soothe all Prop.-D nightmares and set the holiday spirit raging.

PERKS fireplace, settle your buns into those 
cozy cushions and warm up with a latte and a 
sprinkle of cinnamon, you can almost imagine 
you’re in your favorite indie cafe back home in the 
North Pole. Sure, if you take a good look around 
you’ll realize you’re still being oppressed by the 
corporate travesty that is the UCSD Bookstore, but

Men’s Water Polo
at WWPA Championships 

Nov. 21-23

The No. 8 Tritons’ quest 
for their second Western 
Water Polo Association 
Championship in three sea-
sons will begin on Friday 
night at Claremont College. 
Second-seeded UCSD has a 
first-round bye and will battle 
the winner of seventh-seed 
Claremont vs. 10th-seed UC 
Santa Cruz at 3 p.m. If the 
Tritons make it to the cham-
pionship game, they will likely 
face No. 6 Loyola Marymount 
University. LMU has won all 
three of the team’s meetings 
this season but all the games 
have been either decided by 
one goal or have gone into 
overtime. UCSD pummeled 
Claremont 20-4 in their only 
game this season and beat 
UC Santa Cruz 19-8 earlier 
this year.

ond seed behind only Cal

survivor of this regional will 
move on to the national quar-
terfinals, which are scheduled 
to take place Dec. 4 to 6 at a 
site to be determined. UCSD’s 
quest for a ticket there begins 
with Cal State Los Angeles, 
a team that has given coach 
Tom Black fits. The Tritons 
went 0-2 against CSULA, los-
ing in straight sets at home 
in September and suffering 
another defeat in a tough five-
set match in Los Angeles last 
month.

onds left, and two free throws by 
Osier ensured the win for UCSD. 

Gaskin said she was glad that 
the team was able to hold off Dixie 
State’s runs and get the victory.

“You always want to start out 
strong with a win,” she said. “Being 
able to come out at home and get the 
first one out of the way feels pretty 
good.”

For the contest, UCSD shot 27 
of 60, good for 45 percent while the 
Rebels hit only 38 percent of their 

shots. The Tritons also won the 
battle of the boards by out-rebound-
ing Dixie State 39-35. 

The Tritons go on the road for 
their next games to Bellingham, 
Wash., for the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association/Great 
Northwest Athletic Conference 
Classic to take on Seattle Pacific and 
Western Washington on Nov. 21 and 
22, respectively.

Tritons’ first test of the season. With 
12 Tritons seeing game action, play-
ers were able to show glimpses of 
success to come during the game. 
Freshman forward/center Christian 
Hatch scored seven points on 3-
for-4 shooting from the field in his 
collegiate debut, while Casey Ryan, 
having taken only two shot attempts 

during all of last season, went 3-for-
3 — 1-for-1 from long distance — to 
also finish with new career-highs of 
seven points and five rebounds.

“I felt like it was a pretty good 
overall game, but we still have some 
things we need to work on,” Hatch 
said of his first game. “It was a tal-
ented team we were playing, so it 
was a good experience. I think we’ll 

learn from it. The Tritons returned 
to action against another Division-
I opponent, traveling to face 
University of the Pacific on Nov. 
19 at the Pacific Athletic Center in 
Stockton. Scores were not available 
at press time.

“The doubles is very important 
to the outcome of the match, and I 
feel our teams will be stronger than 
ever,” she said.

Sophomore Natalie Varnay had a 
strong tournament, going 3-1 over-
all while participating in both for-
mats. In singles, Varnay won both of 
her matches, defeating Kayla Moyse 
of Montana, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 on Sunday 
and registering a 6-1, 6-2 over Regan 
Newman of Northern Arizona. 
Junior Anita Athavale finished with 
a 2-2 record, splitting her matches 
in singles and doubles, while serv-
ing as Varnay’s partner. Athavale 
dropped her first singles match, fall-
ing to Kim Van Ginkle of Northern 
Arizona 6-3, 6-2, but responded 
well on Sunday with a 6-0, 6-0 blow-
out win over Anna Higane of UC 
Riverside. In doubles action, Varnay 
teamed with Athavale to defeat a UC 
Riverside doubles team by an 8-2 
score, which turned out to be the 
only doubles match the Tritons were 
able to win over the duration of the 
tournament. Varnay’s other doubles 
match also came with Athavale, but 
ended as a 9-7 loss on the first day 
of action. 

Sophomore Cindy Dao also had 
a strong debut in singles play, com-
fortably defeating Rebecca Bran of 
Montana by a 6-3, 6-4 score. Dao’s 
only other match of the tournament 
came when she joined sophomore 
Valerie Tang in a doubles match 
against the Northern Arizona team 
of Van Ginkle and Newman. The 
Tritons duo fell by an 8-6 score, 
but had one of UCSD’s stronger 
performances on the doubles side. 
Tang lost her other doubles tilt, 
teaming with senior Tessa Tran in 
an 8-4 setback. Tang and Tran had 
more success in singles, with the 
duo combining to win all four of 
their matches in that format. Tang 
won her first match in a decisive 
6-2, 6-2, then followed with a gut-
wrenching 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 win over 
Amanda Bran of Montana. Tran was 
the only Triton able to win both of 
her singles matches in straight sets, 

defeating Aimee Oki of Northern 
Arizona 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday and 
blowing by a UC Riverside oppo-
nent in a 6-0, 6-0 rout. 

Senior Ina Dan, the team’s most 
experienced player, got off to a 
strong start in the tournament, win-
ning her singles match 6-0, 6-3 over 
Martyna Nowak of Montana. Dan 
was winless the rest of the way, los-
ing two doubles matches with soph-
omore Taskeen Bains and falling 
6-2, 6-0 in her singles finale. Dan 
and Bains were defeated in their 
first doubles match by Edit Suhajda 
and Yumi Hasegawa of Northern 
Arizona in an 8-6 final score. The 
duo’s other doubles match wasn’t 
nearly as interesting as they fell 8-
1. Bains was able to make amends 
in singles. In her first match, Bains 
overcame a 5-3 third set deficit dur-
ing which she overcame three match 
points. 

Freshman Katie Mulloy also had 
the opportunity to participate in 
the tournament, the only first-year 
player to compete for the Tritons. 
She went 0-3 in her matches, los-
ing her first singles match 7-6, 6-1 
to Kayla Moyse of Montana. In her 
only doubles match, Mulloy teamed 
with Tran, but the duo couldn’t find 
a rhythm, losing 8-1 to the Young 
sisters of UC Irvine. Mulloy dropped 
her final match by a 6-1, 6-4 score.

With their fall season now com-
plete, the Tritons will be on hiatus 
until Feb. 2 when they will host Cal 
Baptist at the North Courts. During 
that time, LaPlante said her team 
needs to work on fitness, quick-
ness and mental toughness. UCSD 
will open defense of its California 
Collegiate Athletic Association title 
and its 40-match unbeaten streak 
in conference matches when it trav-
els to face division rival Cal State 
Bernardino on Feb. 11. The Tritons 
will be on the road for much of the 
month of February, but will open 
CCAA play at home when they face 
Cal Poly Pomona on March 11.

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The Tritons 
took the court last weekend for the 
Anteater Invitational on Nov. 15 and 
16, the team’s final appearance in 
the fall season before its next match 
in February. After having over a 
month off, the Tritons were eager 
to return to action for one last test 
before the long break. The tour-
nament, which UC Irvine hosted, 
was especially important for 29-year 
coach Liz LaPlante because it gave 
her team an opportunity to measure 
itself against Division-I competi-

tion.
“I was extremely proud of the 

way my team played because this 
was, by far, the best we have ever 
done,” LaPlante said. “In past years 
we have come away hardly winning 
sets, let alone matches against these 
teams. But, in the last couple years, 
our team has continued to get stron-
ger and we have gotten better results 
over here. This year, however, we 
achieved unprecedented success and 
it’s really a testament to my team 
and how hard they’ve worked this 
season.”

Over the course of the tourna-
ment, UCSD got a good sense of 
its strengths and weaknesses while 
taking on teams from the University 
of Montana, Northern Arizona 
University, Loyola Marymount, UC 
Riverside and host UC Irvine. The 
Tritons finished the tournament 
with mixed results, performing 
extremely well in singles, but strug-

gling in doubles. They combined 
to go 11-4 in singles over their two 
days of action, but could only win 
one of their seven doubles match-
es. LaPlante attributed the team’s 
struggles in doubles to a lack of 
preparation — something she plans 
to work on in detail over the next 
two months.

“I really feel we have three poten-
tially great doubles teams, but they 
still need more time to work togeth-
er,” LaPlante said. “We have so little 
time in fall to practice and we were 
spending more time practicing sin-
gles in the early going. However, I 
really intend to start stressing dou-
bles more in January right before 
our spring season starts.”

LaPlante is confident the team 
will be able to turn doubles into 
a team strength over the next few 
months of practice.

Strong First Half Not 
Enough to Top SDSU

No Jitters on Opening Night

By Robert Ingle
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Senior 
forward Michelle Osier had 21 
points, six rebounds and three 
steals Sunday afternoon, leading the 
UCSD women’s basketball team to a 
71-61 season-opening victory over 
Dixie State College in a nonconfer-
ence game at RIMAC Arena.

Osier and senior center Alexis 
Gaskin were pivotal parts of the 
Tritons’ inside game. Gaskin fin-
ished the night with 19 points and 
eight rebounds, and was a major 
physical presence for the UCSD 
posts, who contributed 40 of the 
team’s 71 total points.

Head coach Charity Elliott was 
happy to get the victory and was 
particularly pleased with the team’s 
post play.

“One of our highlights tonight 
was just Gaskin and Osier being 
able to attack inside,” Elliot said. 
“We had a definite advantage on the 
inside.” 

The Tritons jumped out to an 
early 8-2 advantage on an Osier 
layup just four minutes into the 
contest. Dixie State fought to stay 
in the game, but UCSD maintained 
a lead that grew as large as eight 
points. Two free throws by Dixie 
State’s senior forward Jessica Carver 
cut the Triton lead to 23-20 with 
five minutes left in the half, but 
the Tritons responded by turning 
up their defense. UCSD ended the 
period on a 9-2 run that gave the 
team momentum heading into the 
locker room at the half. 

“Our defensive intensity played 

a big part in the run at the end of 
the half,” Gaskin said. “Everyone 
stepped up and it got [the Rebels] 
frustrated and they started forcing 
shots.”

UCSD came out in the second 

half firing on all cylinders and 
increased its 37-24 halftime lead. 
Junior point guard Leilani Martin, 
who had 13 points, seven rebounds, 
five assists and three steals for 
the game, knocked down two free 
throws to put the Tritons ahead by 
19 at the 10:40 mark. 

Responding with a surge of their 
own, the Rebels closed the lead by 
going on a 10-1 run during the 
following two minutes. The come-
back was cut short, however, as an 
Osier layup off a Martin assist and 
a jumper by Gaskin secured the 
Triton lead. 

The Rebels made a final push 
in the closing three minutes of the 
game and came within six points, 
but Martin made sure it was the 
closest they came. The transfer hit 
an important jumper with 26 sec-

The women’s basketball 
team survived a second-
half Rebel run to post 
a 71-61 victory in the 
season’s first game.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons put together one of their 
most memorable outings against a 
Division-I rival on Saturday night, 
taking a slight lead into the half 
against cross-town opponent San 
Diego State in the season-opening 
game. Battling the perennial post-
season contender throughout the 
contest, the Tritons held SDSU to 
only 19 points in the first half before 
ultimately falling by a final score of 
59-40.

Facing an Aztec squad that 
returned all five of its starters and 
its top eight scorers from last sea-
son, the Tritons had to come togeth-
er quickly in their first action of the 
2008-09 season. After getting off 
to a slow start — outscored 9-0 in 
the first six minutes of the match 
— sophomore guard Casey Ryan 
put UCSD on the board, recording 
his first collegiate field goal with an 
impressive put-back. Tough Triton 
defense kept the Aztecs without a 
fast-break basket and only three sec-
ond-chance points in 
the first half as UCSD’s 
hustle negated SDSU’s 
size advantage.

“I was really happy 
about the first half — I 
thought we played real-
ly hard,” Ryan said. “[We] came out 
with a lot of energy and emotion 
and kind of did what we wanted. We 
slowed the game down, didn’t really 
let them get going.”

Using a fluid offense and consis-
tently making the extra pass to get 
the best look possible, the Tritons 
came all the way back to take their 
first lead of the game, 15-13, after 
back-to-back three-pointers by 
senior guard Kelvin Kim with 7:24 
left to play in the first half. In front 
of a stunned San Diego State crowd 
that seemed to be expecting an easy 
season opener, UCSD extended its 
advantage to eight points with 3:47 
left in the half. Led by eight points 
from Kim and eight rebounds from 
senior forward Darryl Lawlor, the 
Tritons held off a late Aztec charge 
to take a two-point advantage, 21-
19, into the break.

“I thought our preparation was 
pretty good,” head coach Chris 
Carlson said, now in his second 
season with UCSD. “I think we had 
a really good understanding, cer-
tainly in the first 20 minutes, of 
what we were going to see. I think 

we handled the pressure pretty well 
for our first game.”

San Diego State looked more 
like the talented and well-coached 
team that has made three consecu-
tive postseason appearances in the 
second half, putting together a 14-5 
run in the first 4:36 after intermis-
sion to retake the lead. UCSD would 
stay within striking distance, until 
a 10-0 SDSU run put the game out 
of reach with just over four minutes 
left to play.

“There are some things we have 
to work on,” Carlson said. “Our 
aggression tabled off in the second 
half and we’ve got to learn how 
to play from ahead. We just kept 
kind of absorbing their hits, rather 
than punching back like we did in 
the first half. We have got to learn 
how to play a 40-minute game … 
how to play in long stretches and 
withstand runs. In that sense, this is 
something we can really learn and 
grow from.”

Despite the loss, the 59-40 final 
score represented the third-closest 
game in the all-time series between 
the two squads. Most impressively, 

the Tritons allowed the 
fewest points San Diego 
State has ever scored 
against UCSD — the 
previous low was 70 in 
the teams’ first meeting 
almost 40 years ago.

“Defensively, we did a great 
job,” Carlson said. “We were in the 
right spots when we needed to be. 
Anytime you hold a team that is as 
talented and as well-coached as San 
Diego State to 28 percent shooting 
in the first half, you’re going to have 
a shot to win.”

Kim led the way offensively for 
UCSD with 11 points to go along 
with two assists and two steals. 
Lawlor grabbed a game-high 10 
rebounds, while scoring four points 
and adding three assists in the game. 
Sophomore forward Billy White was 
one of three Aztecs who scored in 
double figures with a game-high 15 
points, while also contributing to 
a team-high eight rebounds. Both 
teams shot under 40 percent from 
the field with UCSD shooting 31.5 
percent and SDSU shooting 36.7 
percent. The Aztecs also held a 
slight 37-35 rebounding advantage.

Carlson used a myriad of sub-
stitutions, keeping fresh players out 
on the court and looking for suc-
cessful lineup combinations in the
