Sparks in Forest 
Light Sun God Fest 

By CLYDENE NEE 
Sluff Wriler 

Adam Forest, who currently holds 
no position m the AssoCIated Student 
go\'ernm nt, recent Iy negotiated a deal 
wIth concert promotion company Fahn 
and Silva for $5,800 (m inus University 
expenses) for (he band Sparks to 
perform a( UC D's Sun God Festival 
thIs Frida\ 

Members of the ASUC D have 
alleged that this does not follow the 
original proposal which was passed by 
the Council when the funds were set 
as ide for the Sun God Fetival. 

A UC 0 Bill #91, which was 
'iubmitled by AS President Henry Chu, 
and passed by the AS Council was 
"Ime itemt.'d" These line items show 
exact I" hem the AS expected the 
allocateu $6,800 to be spent on the 
Fl'!'>ltvaI. fhe line items included: 
talent - $2.:iOO; sound - $1,200; 
lights - SHOO; advertIsing - $500; 
technical director - $150; crew -
$7!i(); ~(,clIrit v - :'1 :iO, facillt \ use -

0\ l'r M:i percent of t he total budget for 
the dar Oil obtaining the, parks. 

l\ss()ciated Student Acl\' isor Rand\ 
Woodard described t he original plan 
for the ~ un (;od Fesl1\'al by saytng, "I 
thmk that wht'n this started, \\e 
wantl'd t () makt' it a bIg U11l\ erslt)

would take place every ~ear ..

been a day of music, food boot hs, 
clctt\·lt ies. a TGIF, and a dance m the 
evpntng. which would have been free 
or WCJU Id have cos tone dolla r 
adm ls:-;ion. It has instead becom(' a 
TGIF with food booths plus the parks 
concert. 

rorcst alleged thal :,'- "dsdctlllgon 
behalf of A President Henry Chu 
",hen he negotIated the deal with Bill 
Sliva for the parks to play at the 'un 
God Festival. 

When asked If he had given this 
authority to Forest, Chu's response 
was. "I wIsh I had seen the contract 
before it was signed." 

Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
Lee Anderson was only one of many 
cou nci lmember s who directed 
qU(''itlons to Forest. "Look at us and 
tellu'i what the hell was gomg through 
YOUI mtnd when you committed us to 
spend money we thought was going 
elsew here to some little deal you have 
going with Fahn and Silva." 

Forest responded, "To any 
discus<;ion. there are two 'i ides. You 
can make it look bad or good." Forest 
then proceeded to explain his intent. 
" What I ha\'{' done is take the $5,800 
and make It into a $12.000 event." He 
then explamed to the counctlmembers 
t hat If 1,200 st uclents arc allowed to 
buy tickets at $3. rather than a regular 
admission price for such concerts of 
$9.50. the} \\()uld besa\'mg$6.50each, 
\\ hich leads to a (otal student discount 
of $7.HOO. 0 after subtracting the 
$[),HOO in AS funds, continued Forest, 
the benefit to the s tudent s shou ld be 
$2.000. (ThIS past Friday it was 
del.'lmined by Fahn and ilva that the 
tickets ",ill go up to 6 the day of the 
conceit ).

Runoffs Wednesday 
For Two Positions 

By LEE ANDERSON 
Staff W 'il"r 

Despite the efforts of the Interslate 
5. the Tupperware Party swept the AS 
election last week. They ca ptured 100f 
their 12 targeted seats and placed two 
candidates 111 the run·off elections 
Wednes da y. In addition. semi· 
independent presidential candidate 
Craig Lee won a spot in the run·off 
along with Tupperware lid Marc 
Geiger. 

The communications commissioner 
POSIt ion WIll also be deCIded this 
Wednesday when voters finally decide 
between Tim PIckwell and Da\'id (D. 
Joseph) Parker. 

Even though Pickwell was 
di squalified b) the Elec ti ons 
Commission for a number of alleged 
illegal campaIgn maneuvers (e.g. using 
AS funds for the Tupperware 
campaign and libel ing hIS opponent. 
the AS JudiCial Board remstated hllll 
and ruled that their particular electIOn 
be conducted agall1.

The most ironic aspect of the run· 
off. however, IS t he race for preSident.

Blunders Destabalize 
Student Government 

One would think that by Spring Quarter, the 
members of the Associated Students Council would 
have mastered their respective jobs. Some members, 
of course, do know what they are doing, and it is they 
along with AS Advisor Randy Woodard who keep the 
entire student government structure from collapsing. 
But we cannot overlook several AS members' valiant 
attempts of late to further destabilize what remains 
functional in this year's Council. 

Two incidents of the past week serve to underline 
the student body's frustration with their "leaders," 
First, and most obvious, is the case of Catherine 
Eichhorn, AS commissioner of elections, and her poor 
performance handling campaign violations before 
and during last week's primary election. The second 
case is that of Adam Forest and Henry Chu and their 
misadventures in the province of legal contracts and 
rock music promotion. 

Eichhorn's troubles began when several campaign 
violations were filed against Tim Pickwell by Reggie 
Williams of the new indicator collective. Eichhorn 
convened the Election Commission and held "trial" 
for Pickwell, finding hIm guiltyof someof the charges 
filed against him, and ultimately disqualifying him 
for a charge not filed - conflict of interest. 
Apparently, Eichhorn and a majority of the Election 
Commission found that Pickwell's authorship of a 
Koala article supporting the Tupperware Party and 
himself, and decrying the candidacy of Pickwell's 
opponent, David (D. Joseph) Parker, was a conflict-of-
interest. Eichhorn erred when she failed to give 
Pickwell adequate time to prepate his defense and by 
allowing the commission to disqualify Pickwell on a 
violation for which he was not formally charged. 

Fortunately for both candidates involved, the 
Judicial Board overruled Eichhorn by finding 
Pickwell innocent of the charges filed against him, 
and ordering that the election be rerun during· the 
run-off elections. The Board was also wise in 
requesting that a clearer definition of conflict of 
interest be amended to the election codes in order to 
prevent a repeat of Pickwell's legal but possibly 
unethical use of the student-funded media. 

All parties involved in the fiasco agree that 
Eichhorn disappointed them. We agree with Parker, 
Pickwell, and others who found Eichhorn's 
performance less than respectable. Rather than 
mediate the election process, Eichhorn has served to 
undermine its credibility in the eyes of the entire 
UCSD community. 

And while the elections for next year's Council 
we re going awry , this year's president failed in hi s 
const ilut ional duty to keep tabs on a $6,800 allocation 
for the Sun God Festival. He maintainS that he was 
simply unaware of the measures Adam Forest, a 
student delegated the responsibility of arranging 
entertainment for the event, had taken in obtaining 
the mu<;ical group Spar/,s. His inattention to detail in 
this matter has cost the students a great sum of 
money that the Council as a whole never intended to 
be spent in that manner. 

*** 
We are disappointed, but not surprised, that these 

two events took place so near to the end of the 
academic year. Neither are we surprised at the apathy 
expressed by all those studenLs who did not vote in 
last week's primary elections. How can we expect 
students Lo not be cynical about student politics when 
blunders like this occur with such frequency.

Letters to the Editor 

Fraternities, Sororities Not 
A Loss of Iden ti ty 
Editor: 

Last week whi le I was 
si tting at the rush information 
table which my fraternity had 
set up in RevelIe Plaza, a 
student passed by and I asked 
him if he was interested in 
joining the fraternity. "No," 
he replied, "I want to keep my 
identity," and walked off. It is 
that type of attitude, held by 

Linda Clark 
Says Thanks 
Editor: 

I would likeLOthanktho eof 
you who showed your support, 
through campaign assistance 
and vote, for the candidates of 
the Interslate Five in seeking 
election to I he AS Council. 
Though defeated, I sti ll believe 
that broad· based representa-
tion of student interests is the 
on ly valid form of student 
government. We attempted to 
achieve this by running 
candidates from a many 
different constituencies as 
possible. We ran a campaign 
focused on issues of concern to 
all st udents with the aim of 
working on and resolving 
problems wit hout the 
distractions of partisan 
politics and petty clannish· 
ness. 

I hope that in the future 
more students will become 
concerned enough to get 
involved with the processes 
that decide their fates at this 
university. WIlen you find 
problems with fee increases 
and lack of student input with 
regard to how your money is 
spent, remember that talk IS 
cheap and action gels resu Its. 

[n the upcoming pres i-
dential runoff election, you 
should conSider that parti sa n 
blocs on l he Council tend to 
vote in their own bes t 
Int erests, wh Ich are inher-
entl y limiled . If Ihe leadershIp 
is In line Wit h a bloc access bv 
non ·a ffiliated st udl'nts is 
sevcrely curtailed, resulting in 
Inadequate representation III 
the allocat ion of your money. 

I, and all the members of the 
Inters late Five. would urge 
you to 'i ll pport Craig Lee ror 
AS president. In discussion 
with 111m [ have found hlln to 
be thoughful of the issues and 
willing to deliberale fairly on 
I he allocation of funds to those 
groups Ihat have hIstorically 
brecl contention with in lhe AS 
CouncIl. 

Linda Clark 

many on this campus, which 
really distresses me. I do not 
understand why such a feeling 
toward the Greek system 
·exisls. 

To begin with, fraternities 
and sororit ies do not, in any 
way, rob one of h is or her 
identity. Within a fralernityor 
sorority, as this particular 
student obviously does not 
realize, each member adds to 
the organization simply by 
being him / her se lf . If 
fraternity members are seen 
as one in t he same, then I 
suggest a new set of eyeglasses 
for the viewer: for the 
members are as diverse a 
group as can be seen anywhere 
on campus, or anywhere in the 
world. 

Al so, the principle ' that the 
fraternity to which I belong is 
based on, as well as all others I 
am su re, advance an attitude 
of respect and friendliness 
toward non -members. No man 
s hould be degraded because he 

is not a member of a social 
fraternity. In stead, each 
individual should be regarded 
for his personal merits , ability, 
and characler. 

The facl is that fraternities 
and sororities are needed at 
UCSD, are growing now, and 
will continue to grow in the 
future. [t is obvious that the 
student who chooses to attend 
UCSD desires to get a good 
education. What is wrong, 
then, when the same student 
e lects to join a ocia l 
fraternity? 1 think nothing, 
and these s tudents should not 
be treated differently than a 
student who plays badmitlon, 
basketball, or hackeysack! 
This is all that i asked of by 
fraternity and soro rit y 
members from the students at 
UCSD. Now is the time for the 
senseless ri\'alry between 
fraternity and non-fraternity 
members to end.

No Sanctuaries in Beirut: 
Only T"error in Lebanon 

B ROGER SIMON Lo~ 1ngcle~ Timc~ SYlldicUle 
There are no sanctuaries in 

Beirut: that' s the first thing 
you learn' there. 

Chur c h es, mo s que s, 
hospitals, schools, embassies 
- they are all fair game, all 
targets. 

The doctrine used by the 
warring factions IS simple: 
The purpose of terrorism is to 
terrorize. And to terronze you 
must convince people there i 
nowhere they are safe. 

Beirut, like the rest of 
Lebanon, is a free fire zone for 
whoever has a bomb and ' the 
wi II to use it. 

I was in Beirut both before 
and after the Israeli invasion 
and while certain things in the 
city changed, ..thaI basic fact 
did not. 

Many embass ies in Beirut 
have been attacked over the 
years, though none with the 
devastation of the bomb that 
went off in front of the 
American embassy Monda~ 

The usual attack \\ as a hit 
and run job: a grenade thrown 
from a car WIndow or the 
r<lking fi re of a machine gun 
mounted on I he hack of a 
'ipeeding truck. 

Embassies look precau· 
tlOn" There \\ere armed 
guards. Ground floor \\ indo\\';. 
were of Len bricked. Bumper 
strips were IDstalled 111 Ihe 
road so that cars had to sIO\\' 10 
a crawl whde passing. ThIS 
prevented quick getaway~ . 

The American embass\ is in 
the Moslem secllOn of Beirut, 
an a rea Ihal \\'asu nder 'ynan 
co ntrol before the Israeli 
im asion . 

On m\ first day in BeIrut 
two years ago, I met a vou ng 

~orwegian ant Iquc collector 
named Karin Lins\ad Her 
apartment \\.·i ndows had been 
blasted by a car bomb t he night 
before and ralor·like s hards of 
glass had bet'n dri\en inlo her

their s ides pockmarked by 
small ·arllls fire from the 197G-
76 civil war. Looming over the 
harbor in Christian Beirut 
was the blasted hulk of the 
Holiday Inn . 

Although about 50 people a 
day were being killed by 
s helling and ambush during 
·t hese weeks, the s treets were 
choked with car I raffic. 

The city seemed to function 
by force of habit . 

Street lights did not work . 
Garbage was not collected but 
was left to-pileup in empty lots 
until someone grew tired of the 
smell and set it on fire. 

Taxes were collected at 
gunPoint by the PLO or the 
Christian militia , depending 
on which part of town you 
lived in . 

But the bars and restau-
rant s were lively and the 
c inemas had recent U.S. films. 

Beirut was then and still is 
the trading and finan c ial 
cent er for the Arab world. 
Cuban ciga rs. ~rench perfume 
and Mercedes-Benz cars were 
a\ailable and cheap. 

Weapons were a lso plenti· 
ful. The C hl'lsllans had 
\\eapons ~upplied b} the 
l'irae!l'i . The S\'rians and PLO 
had SO\ iet \\(;apons and I h(' 
Amcrlcan \\l'apons that the 
('.S . had abandoned in 
VI('tnam .

the expense of more expensive 
but worthwhile functions for 
organizations such as the 
BSU, Mecha, Asian Affairs, 
and LAGO. Some feel that the 
Tupperware influence will 
prove fatal to some student 
publications, and the Political 
Film Series, already in a 
precarious position , could be 
performing its swan·song. 

If Geiger does win the 
presidential run ·off and 
retains overt power over the 
Tupperware Party, the 
Executive Session may 
become a common occurrence 
at AS meetings when the 
council is confronted with 
serious issues. The Executive 
Session enables the president 
to exclude all non·council 
members (i.e. students) from a 
meeting in order to meet with 
the council only. With a 
predominant Tupperware 
council, most important issues 
counter to Tupperware 
ideology may suffer ignomin· 
ious deaths in the Executive 
Session . 

Interslate 5 and the other 
independents occurred due to 
more effective campaigning 
and a higher budget, or 
political manipulation of a 
desire to party, matters very 
little now. The t!lection has 
passed and the results will 
stand. It is, as one student put 
it, "an accurate reflection of 
the campus attitude. " More 
precisely, it is an accurate 
r("flection of those who voted 
- a mere 17·20% of the UCSD 
student body. 

The run·off for president, 
though the candidates differ 
very little, could be important 
simply from a momentum 
standpoint. A Geiger victory 
conjures up visions of an 
absolute monarchy in which 
potential opposition is 
effectively and financially 
silenced, and important issues 
play second fiddle to the 
court 's social life. Besides, all 
this talk of Tupperware is 
driving me crazy. Plastics, 
Ben. Plastics.

God & Science: Not Incompatible 
Editor: 

James H . johnson and 
Norman F. Hall have , both 
written ant i-religious letters 
to the Cuardiall (Feb. 28 and 
Mar. 3). Here is a reply : 

Mr. Johnson mentions the 
large number of pro-religious 
works in existence. But with 
the present school system, 
students are not exposed to' 
such works there, Unless one 
goes to a religious school, 
church, or religious bookstore, 
it is not available. In general 
you cannot get it unless you 
want it. Also, Bible criticism is 
nothing new or all that rare. 
Mr. johnson himself recalls 
reading hundreds of Bible-
opposing works . 

Scientists have also let 
personal convictions hinder 
discovery, as Dr. Hall pointed 
Jut. But the Bible teaches 
nothing against quantum 
physics. Also, for over 100 
years- evolutionists have let 
the idea of gradual evolution 
hamper the acknowledgement 
that the links are missing. 
"The foss ils unearthed by 
paleontologists have shown no 
cases of abrupt transforma· 

tion, but many of grad~al 
evolution" (The Wonder of LIfe 
on Earth, vol. I, ed. by LIfe 
(1961), p, 4), Gould would call 
this a lie. 

:'clence did 110t develop in 
reaction to the Christian world 
view. johannes Kepler, one of 
the found s of phys ical 
astronomy, called his research 
"thinking God's thought s 
after Him." Many of science's 
founding fathers were of the 
opinion that since God is a God 
or order, we can look for order 
in ' His creation (codify 
observations). 

Dr. Hall also states that the 
pro·religion letter writers do 
not understand science. As for 
my letter I did not intend to 
write on the definition of 
science, but to deal with Mr. 
Johnson's first letter. I know 
science is also predictive (if I 
drop my pen I expect it to fall). 
Also Gary Lee did not assert 
that science is merely 
'descriptive, but primarily 
descriptive. 

appears to be using the 
experimental method as an 
a llegory. In response to Mr. 
Johnson 's supposed Biblical 
inconsistencies he wa s 
pointing out that scientists 
observe many inconsistencies, 
yet do not always reject their 
theories. 

The arguments of Adrienne 
Harris and Anonymous (Feb, 
28 and Mar. 7) are valid only if 
the discovery, after death. of 
the ex istence of God is mere 
trivia to the deceased. With the 
Biblical God this would not be 
the case. And remember, love 
would cause believers to try 
and save your soul, regardless 
of God's commandment to do 
so. 

Both Mr. Johnson and Dr. 
Hall advocate free thought, 
but what do they mean by it? 
Dr . Hall speaks of the 
.. Tru thseeker, one of the olde t 
free-thought journals in the 
United States, publis hed by 
Mr . john son . " And Mr . 
Johnson tate "some thinkers 
(f ree thinkers) reject the 
Bible." With such s tatements 
they urge the reader 
(intentionally and accident· 
ally) not to bother with both 

Voting Marc Geiger into the 
AS presidency is analogous to 
e lecting Frazier Smith 
Governor of California, which 
on the surface doesn't sound 
like such a bad idea, but may, 
in the long run, prove 
impractical. One Interslate 5 
candidate summed up the 
elections as a victory for "sex, 
drugs and rock and roll ," and a 
defeat for some vital issues. 
Some students felt that the 
nature of party politics (as 
oppsed to issue politics) had 
spelled defeat for substantive 
issues anyway. 

Meatballs & Sour Cream 

Dr. Hall quoted from many 
letters (one of which, Kri s ta 
Kiger's, [ di sagree with). With 
these, and his discussions of 
natural law s and the 
probability of the "God 
hypothesis ," he seems to be 
asserting this: since we have 
Codified natural laws, miracles 
are precluded. This statement 
would be valid if 50% of all 
events were miracles. It would 
be difficult to discover uch 
laws if half of what happens 
did not obey them. But Biblical 
miracles are infrequent. This 
allows plenty of time and 
events for men to di scover the 
laws of nature. Thus Biblical 
miracles and natural laws are 
not mutually exclusive. 

ides, but conform to theirs for 
they are the "only" free 
thinkers. This contradicts Mr. 
Johnson 's advice not to accept 
ready-made opinions. 

But whether the Tupper·

Jim Poole 
To what experiments and 

"chosen experimentalists" is 
Dr. Hall referring? Mr, Lee 

Thus we can see that while 
Dr, Hall and Mr. Johnson state 
(quite st rongly ) certain 
opinions (a mong them the 
incompatibility of God and 
SCIence), their arguments fail 
to support them. And if there i 
any confusion as to my 
definition of free thought, here 
it is: make up your OW,! mind. 
Look at all sides, examine their 
argument, and decide for 
yourself.

Dr. lJenni~ , a professor of 

chemistry, jomed the lJCSD 
faculty in 1970 after serving 
for two years as a postdoctoral 
fellow in the Depal1 ment of 
Biological Chemistry at the 
Harvard MediLal School , 
where he plan~ to return for a 
port ion of his sabbat ical } ear. 
Dennis received a BA degree 
from Yale UnIversity in 1963, 
an MA degree in 1965, and a 
PhD in 1968 from Harvard 
University. His Guggenheim 
resea rch will CO\ er st udies in

"The health educator has so 
much fantastic potential we 
still haven't defined all we can 
do," said Daigneault. 

Daigneault has also worked 
on staff attitude problems 
responsible for strained 
patient relations in the past. 
Recent staff meetings, where 
everyone can ta lk things out. 
have provided better internal 
communications and should 
he l p prevent persona l 
problems from getting out of 
hand. 

"Usually health center and 
clinics are staffed by people 
retiring, who no longer want to 
work that hard," said 
Daigneault. "Every phy ician 
we have on staff now likes 
working with people and are 
very competent. Right now I 
feel we have the best ~taff 
e\·er. " 

Dalgneaul t took 0\ er for the 
Hca lth Center's original 
director. Dr. \'_ Robprt Allen, 
who requc~ ted and was 
gralllt'd a leaw for "personal 

rea~ons" until June ;$0. 198:'l, 
but h expectcd to exlend his 
leaH' fllr at lea"t allot her six 
mon t hs. 

"I )r ,\Ilen asked for the 
lea\-c. It \\a~ IWI intended to 
correct for a bad Job. I [e has 
been here hn a long t line (13 
\,ears) and has done a good job. 
i felt l owed It to him in many 

• respects." said Dr.Joe Watson, 
\'ice chancellor of under-
graduate affaIrs, \\ ho oversees 
Health Center operat IOns. 

Though, a good administ ra-
tor and a competent doctor, 
Allen has been criticized for 
fIght ing changes and being 
afraid of losing control of the 
Health Center. 

Daigneault is described as a 
lrberalthrnker and is said to be 
more opcn wit h 'it udents and 
staff. ":\s for patient care, 
\\e're the same." Daigneault 
contended. " Pati ents as 
students arc well cared for." 

"Dr. Daigneault has done a 
really good Job. I don 't have 
any complaints," said Rep. 
Warner. "Under Allen, we 
seemed to be working 
separately, putting pressure 
on him. Dr. Daigneault is 
really in tune with students. 
He comes to all our meetings. I 
feel we're working with him, 
helping him research his 
problems." 

"The Healt h Center has had 
a bad reputation for a number 
of veal's." said Warner. " [t's 
reailv been underutilizecl." 

DaigneauII said that many 
"tudents are not aware they

Monday, A pril 25, 1983 

Student Center Mess 
continued from page 5 
chairman, had been working 
on a description for an 
Operations Coordinator 
position designed to aid the 
St udent Center Director in 
hislher responsibilities. The 
OC position would involve full -
time work with the students 
w hile the Director would be 
concerned with negotiations 
with the administration. 

In October 1981, the Student 
Center Board recommended 
that Marco LiMandri, a 
secretray who also advised the 
Co-ops and ran EDNA, be 
promoted to this Operations 
Coordinator position on an 
interim basis until a new 
director could be found. 
VVatson rejected this proposal 
as well as the idea of an 
interim Operation Coordina-
tor in general. In November, 
1981, Judith Green from 
Student Center Personnel was 
brought in to act as the interim 
Student Center Director. 

[n the early mont hs of 1982, 
a Student Center Board Task 
Force investigated and revised 
the duties of the Operations 
Coordinator with the approval 
of Watson. They recommen-
ded that the Student Center 
Director "should not be hired 
and placed bet""een the OC 
and the VCl.'A (Vice Chancel-
lor of Ll ndergraduate 
Affairs). " 

furt her events of 1982-83 
showed many changes tn 
attitude and policy of the 
involved parties and are 
documented as follows: 

eligibility as an applicant for 
the OC. 

June 28, 1982 - The 
Student Center Board 
disapproved of the job 
description penned by Dye 
because it had been changed 
from the original Task Force 
proposal. As a compromise 
effort, they recommended that 
LiMandri be able to retain his 
Co-op and EDNA advising 
status by a formal job 
reclassification based on those 
duties. They also recommen· 
ded that Judith Green (whose 
future was uncertain) be 
retained until an official 
director could be fou nd. 
Watson turned down the 
proposals. 

At this time. a committee 
was interviewing candidates 
based on the job description 
written by Dye that wal' 
objected to by the Board. 
Eventually, all eligible 
candidates turned down the 
position and the search was 
abandoned. 

j u ly 28, 1982 - The 
Student Center Board wrote a 
letter to Watson expressing 
concern o\'er the changed job 
description and asking thaI a 
positIon be created to use "the 
resources of Marco LiMandri 
for the benefit of the Center." 
Watson turned down the 
proposal. 

August 1982 - Judith 
Green left her position as 
interim direc tor and Dye 
became the acting Interim 
director. 

Marco LiMandri left his job 
as secretary at the Student 
Center.

student Center Board Task 
Force job description 
recommendations for the 
Operations Coordinator were 
made to Asst. Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Ray Dye, who 
was to write the final 
description. This recommen· 
dation included diagram 
models of the level at which 
the OC and director positions 
fit into the Student Center 
staff hierarchy as a whole. 

October 1982 - The 
Student Center Board 
recommended that a task force 
be set up to look into the issue 
of a director and create a 
Sl rategy for the long range 
development of the Student 
Center and its goals. The 
Board also expressed a desire 
"to solve the both embarras-
sing and frustrating situation 
of crisis at the Sludent 
Center."

students and both boast close ties to 
Warren College. 

Geiger was also hard pressed to 
di tinguish between himself and Lee. 
"I think my managerial skill s are more 
finely honed than his ." Beyond that , 
the si milarities outweigh the 
differences. "Craig and r are best 
friends ; he was originally going to be 
my vice-president on the Tupperware 
Party ... 

Throughout his campaign, Lee 
demonstrated a clearer underst anding 
of how people vote than did his current 
opponent. When asked if he had any 
material on his campaign issues, Lee 
responded: "The thing is, if you've got 
issues, they don't see your name." Yet, 
Lee has serious goals for the AS next 
year. ' 'I'd like to see the A run 
efficiently . . . I'd like a new 
constitut ion passed." 

Again, both see the presidency as a 
managerial po ition. 

Geiger has a larger cheering section 
in next year's Council than doe ' Lee. 
says Geiger: "My s late won. That to 
me is wi nn ing. The run-off and the 
Tupperware victory are two separate 
thing ." Clearly, there is a difference 
between an election where different 
people run on different i ues and a 
run·off where different people run on 
the same issues (and take similar 
posit Ions).

Craig Leupold, commiSSIOner of

conflict of interest, a violation for 
which he was not formally charged, 
The basis for conflict of interest cited 
is that Pickwell is the managing editor 
of the Koala, a position which enabled 
him to co-author the article supporting 
his own candidacy over that of 
Parker's. 

In the Judicial Board hearing, 
Pickwell argued that the Koala article 
was an editorial; that the Election 
Commission erred in assessing the 
Tupperware Party $50 .00 for 
campaign expenditures; that there 
was no conflict of interest between his 
ca ndidacy and hi s pos ition as 
managing ed itor of The Koala; and that 
his right to due proce s and a fair trial 
was violated by Election Commis-
sioner Catherine Eichhorn . 

The Judicial Board, chaired by 
Melissa Ligman, supported Pickwell's 
appeal, holding that Pickwell was 
deni ed due process; that the media has 
a right to endorse candidates; that the 
article in question was an edi torial ; 
that the Tupperware Party should not 
be charged for this article; that there 
was lack of evidence for the use of 
alcohol ; and that Pickwell is not guilty 
of conflict of interest based on present 
election codes. 

The Board moved tha t both P ickwell 
and Parker be placed on the runoff 
ballot and that the results from last 
week's election be destroyed without 
being released. The Board also 
recommended that the AS election

the use of "AS funded media (i.e. The 
Koala) opens it up to everything." He 
continued, "The (election) process has 
a great deal of instability and is open to 
whoever wants to manipulate it, 
whether it is me or someone else." 

Tupperware Party presidential 
candidate Marc Geiger also had some 
comments in observing this election. 
"The election process has a lot of 
faults . One of the first things that 
comes to mind is the pos ition of the 
election commis ioner. Cathe r ine 
Eichhorn didn 't know th e rules and 
under these circumstances, th e whole 
thing became a farce. An election needs 
a referee: someone who knows the 
rules .. 

Elect ion Commissioner Cather ine 
Eichhorn had these observa tions of the 
elect ion and hearings: "A II parties had 
good intentions ye t their percept ions of 
the system as being full of holes is 
correct. The system was exploited by 
many of them (the candidates) to 
further their own gain by filing 
vio lati on s t o di s quali fy their 
opponent. " 

She continued, "The AS student 
governm ent is really in it s earliest 
stage of development and when 
somebody takes office, it is as if that 
person steps back in time to an almost 
prehi stori c form of law, yet t he laws of 
today are the ones a person has to work 
with."

14 The UCSD Guardian 

By JEFF SA V AGE 
. Staff Writer 

With losses at both ends of a 
doubleheader to Cal Baptist 
College Saturday, UCSD's 
woes continue. The sweep 
runs the Triton record to 5·27 
overall and a dismal 2·]4 in 
league play. They now own a 
12 game losing streak. But 
then again, who's counting? 

One GaIne's Close, One's Not, 
But Results SaIne for Batters 

Saturday's action was billed 
as 'The Larry Smith Show." 
The lefthander from Cal 
Baptist had just pitched the 
entire doubleheader against a 
tough Pt. Lorna squad a week 
earlier and had shut them 
down on just one run in each 
game. Mr. Fantastic isn't the 
only guy with a rubber arm. 
Against UCSD in the first 
game, Smith wasn't qui te as 
generous. He threw one bad 
pitch that Scott Melendrez 
stroked to rightfield in the 
seventh inning for UCSD's 
only hit of the game. Other 
than that , Smith was perfect. 

Meanwhile , Keith Yoko· 
moto was busy silencing the 
Cal Baptist bats until he ran 
into some difficulty in the 
fourth inning. After a lead·off 
walk, Melendrez went to the 
wall in left -center in an 
attempt to flag down a long 
drive, only to have the ball tick 
off his glove and fall over the 
fence for a two run homer. 
Back·to· back s ingles put 
runners on the corners for Cal 
Baptist and another long ball 
cleared the fence in right 
center for a three-run bla t. 

Tritons and was touched for 
three runs in the second on a 
single and an error and then a 
big blast that cleared the wall 
in right for a three· run homer. 

Smith finally proved human 
as he allowed a run in the top 
of the third. Second baseman 
Tim Archer singled to start 
things off. After Joe Mireles 
got aboard on an error, 
Reynolds rapped into a double 
play, leaving Archer at third. 
He scored on a wild pitch by 
Smith. The wild pitch would 
prove to be UCSD's closest 
friend. 

Cal Baptist got that run 
right back in its half of the 
inning and it was 4-1. 

UCSD got back into the 

contest in the eighth inning as 
Jim Martin opened the inning 
with a single and Archer 
collected his third hit of the 
game. Mireles laid down a nice 
sacrifice bunt to move the 
runners to second and third, 
but Reynolds st ruck out for 
the second out. Smith was 
kind enough to throw his 
second wild pitch of the game 
and Mattin scored to make it 4-
2. After ~lendrez walked, Ed 
Novak smgled to drive in· 
Archer and cut the lead to one. 

In the top of the ninth, the 
Tritons tied it when Don 
Petersen got aboard on an 
error, went to second on a 
sacrifice, to third on a single by 
Charles Morris, and scored on 

another base hit by Jim Martin 
to force extra inning and the 
exit of Larry Smith. 

UCSD took the lead in the 
tenth as Mireles reached on an 
error and was sacrificed to 
second by Reynolds. Melen· 
drez drew a walk and Novak 
singled to load the bases. 
Mireles scored on another wild 
pitch to make it 5-4 but that 
was all UCSD could manage. 

Three outs away from a win, 
Reynolds forced his own exit 
by walking the lead hitter. 
Keith Gjarman came on and 
promptly served up a single to 
leave the potential tying run 
on third with nobody out. 
Melendrez hauled in a fly ball 
to right and the Cal Baptist 

A run In the fifth and one 
more in the sixth gave Smith 
some more cushion (as if he 
needed it) and Cal Baptist 
cruised to a 7-0 win. 

Senior Eric Reynolds began 
t he second game for the 

The Tritons and the Titans of Fullerton State battled in the championship game of the UCSD 
Tournament. UCSD won on a last· minute goal.

runner tagged from third. 
Melendrez gunned the throw 
home, but it was up the line a 
few feel. Catcher Jim Martin 
made a sweepcng tag to nail the 
runner in plenty of time for the 
second out to stifle the rally 
and preserve the win. Or did 
he? Apparently the home plate 
umpire was not looking at the 
play and missed the call. 
According to Triton Coach 
Charlie Cox. who was filling in 
for f1u·bugged Head Coach 
Lyle Yates, "The only guy in 
the entire ballpark who 
thought" he was safe was the 
guy calling the play." Instead 
of having two outs and one 
runner on, it was suddenly 
tied with only one down. A 
walk loaded the bases and the 
next hitter followed with a 
single to right to end it. Final 
score: Cal Baptist 6, UCSD 5. 
Ouch. 

The Tritons now find 
themselves tied with Biola for 
the bottom spot in the NAJA 
District 3. If the season ended 
now, UCSD would earn the 
seventh and final spot in the 
playoffs as a result of their 2-0 
edge in head·to-head competi-
tion with Biola. With only four 
games left in the regular 
sea on. one win would 
probably give UCSD a playoff 
spot, since Biola' chimces of 
winning two of its remaining 
four games are quite sl im. 

Even if they manage to gain 
a playoff berth, how well can 
the Tritons respond to all of 
their injury prob lems? 
They've gone through four 
third-basemen . Of the eleven 
pitchers on t he roster, only 
five can still play. Not since 
January 3 has the enti re team 
been healthy. January 3 was 
the first day of the season.

Running Thoughts 
Ily JEFF SAVAGE AND MIKE GREENBERG 

- Staff Write.-
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Houston Oilers hine 
decided to pass on owning the greatest runnmg back duo in NFL 
history. They ha\'e traded thc second pick to t heAnaheim l~ams , 
thereby allowing SM(' star Eric Dickerson toslipaway. Teamed 
v.ith all-everything fullback Earl Campbell, the Oders would 
have led the world in rushing for years to come. With their poor 
passing game, Houston still would not have been able to climb 
(lut of the cellar of the tough AFC Cent ral, but they would ha\'c 
been the first exciting running team since the Dolphins ' Larr} 
Csonka·Jim Kiick-Mercury Morris £'ra in the carly 70\, The 
Rams will 0\\ n Dickerson Tuesday. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The rumor float 109 around 
the NBA for the past month or so that San Diego Clipper Coach 
Paul Silas would be fired became a reality Wednesday afternexm 
as Silas was given the big axe. Ta lk about finding a scapegoat. 
The Clippers finished last in the Pacific Conference with a 25-57 
record. How much of the blame should go to Silas? Nut much. 
Key injuries decimated the team throughout the year, and in 
fact, at one point seven of the 12 players on the opening day 
roster were unable to play. Managing to field and direct a 
starting line-up and a few subs a game was a major 
accomplishment in itself and Silas should have been rewarded 
with a new contract for his efforts. It's obvious that owner

The la t fi \'e ya rd s of 
Brent 's jaunt were into a very 
crowded Sam Son's res taurant 
where th e bio major from 
Arizona State didn't like the 
fact that he was surrounded 
by people. Feeling uneasy, 
Brent proceeded to run in and 
out of a variety of places before 
finding a quiet dentis t 's offi ce 
where he summoned the 
police. 

Meanwhile, McCann fl ed off 
with the UCSD stud ent 's car, 
traveling only a few blocks 
before entering the Ma y 
C o mpany parking lot. 
Apparently, the gunman was 
having trouble working the 
clutch in Brent's 1976 ilver 
Volkswagen Dasher. McCann 
quickly abandoned the Da her 
and forced his way into a car' 
driven by Mary Frances 
Laum<tr, a Pacific Telephone 
emplo 'ee from San Francisco. 

According to the police, 
McCann then dr( lie to the 
Imperial Motel on EI Cajon 
Blvd . where he forced Laumar 
to rent a room . The kirlnapper 
then tied up Laumar and

from a bout 2:30 pm to 8:30 pm 
Wednesday. It was at that 
point tha t the gunman deCIded 
to vaca te the premIses, taking 
Lauma r 's 1983 beige and 
brown AMC Concord , while 
telling his hostage that he \\ as 
heading down to MeXICO 
Laumar freed herself an hour 
later. 

The following day, the case 
took an unique twist. McCan n 
ev id e ntl y neve r hea d ed 
towards Mexico (to the dismay 
of over 100 police combing the 
border), instead. he VIsited a n 
acquain tance of his at 4500 
Twam Ave. She reported ly 
gained the a sail ant 's t ru ·t, 
and when he wasn 't looki ng, 
snuck out of the hou e to call 
the police. 

But McCann wasn't foo led 
for an instance, and left soon 
afterward, heading this time 
towards Mira Me a . He drove 
to the 8800 block of Mira Mesa 
Blvd., parked, and randomly 
went into a condominium 
complex, where he gained 
entrance into an orienta l 
woman's apartment by 
claiming to be a cable repair 
man. Ironically, while he was 
tying the woman up, he 
happened to glance at the TV

The UCSD Lesbian and Gay Organization Quarterly 

Oh, Ihat's Pam, he's sorta my (ather, only she doesn't shave, 
and I call her Pam, 

D.-ar !.ago: 
I want ro thank you for the panel comprised of three of your members 

hdd in my So.:,ology o( Men llass; I thlllk t~at the tudcntlo certainly got 
a great deal out of It, and I know that I did. You a ked (or my reaCtions, 
so h"re thcym:, reIatlvdy unsorted and somewhat 1Il the fn:e-
aSSOClatlon \'eln. First, I was enormously cheered and hopeful. I was 
.lstonlshed to find that I was in a classroom where homo/>hohw U '<.ll not 
UK I Now perhaps thiS IS because as the professor, I was giVing out 
suhtle (or not so subtle) cues that I personally find homophobia a 
hlgutry on a par With raCIsm, sexism and the hke, but I don't thlllk so. I 
think there truly IS a new sOllal cl1mate cmerglng In some places I1ke 
UOlwrslties that recogOlzed that Other peoplc's rights don't have to b" 
threatcnlng, 

My lOense, tur example, wa~ that many of the Mudents I1steneJ to the 
pand as they would han- hsteneJ to a pand on, say, communal I1fe-
styles; not a I1fcstyle that many of them had tried, but one which might 
have some Important lessons for their own hves, whether ur not they 
chose to follow that hfetylc., Then: was some cautluus conservatlsm 
(would thiS be ;10 Ideal l'nvlronment for children? Do we want to 
abandon the "traditional" famlly without thlnkln~ through the 
lUnsequences!) hut a grCJt deal of 01 en lIlqulry ,It the samc time. 

I was also struck hy something Intl'restlng as a SOCiologist. One person 
on the panel argued that helng gay made you an InnOVJtor, that once 
you've challtmged the rull's on sexual preference, vou ha\'e to look at all 
of 'ioClery', rule~ ont' hy one to sec If they work tilr you, In gem·rall think 
th"rL IS a lot ,)f truth fO that iclea, hut It made It .Ill the more interesting to 
me that t!wryone on rh,· panel " "ntl'd (and a~surn,'d th,'y woulJ have) 
hddrl'n. I Jon't know what It mCllnS SOCIologically - clth"r the Wish to 

r Vl', hlldren IS e1,),e tUII hlologllal given, or perhaps the'lll 1.lliz.I[IOn to 
".lnt l.hlldn:n I' so dl'l'P. s to rna "C It unlju~'"onahle, But In any l'VCnt , 
hen' were I'l'nrll' "ho Wl'n' qucstll.nlng a gll',lt many tlung~ III their l!wo" 
I ut wok for grante I th.lt chllJrl'n would ht: part ot thosl' lives , 

hnally, (,md I'm a Imlt' l'mharassed to ~dmlt It), tht' I'and was a rl'al

rht' pant:! made ml reahzl' that Without thost' cues that I had Lome to

that '{Ullt"nts In my dasse!. were hett!rosexual, unles~ they owrtly

So Ilearn~J soml,thmg. I learned to try to he aware of, and lorren for,

Support Group 
Expands 

It has been a ycar loince a support 
group spon o rcd by LAGO was 
created. The upport group was 

~rcated becauloc there were ome 
needs of gay people (and bisexual 
people and people exploring their 
cxual!ty) that needed to be met. 

First and foremost, It prOVided a 
upportlve plale where people cou ld 

go who just needed to have the 
company of people hke themselves. 

Se..:onJ, It provideJ a forum where 
people could talk about tht: Issues 
that were of concern to them . The 
group has been a place where a 
number of pOints of view art: often 
encountered on ISSUt:!. such as 
coming out, paren th ood, 
stcn:lltyplnl!, and rdatlonshlp~.
