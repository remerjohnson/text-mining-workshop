Health reasons cited 

A.S. vice president of 
external affairs resigns 

By ELAINE SMOLER 

The A.S. Vice President of Ex-
ternal Affairs, Jill Marchick, re-
signed last week in an effort to res-
tore her health. 

"I know that there are rumors, 
but I resigned because of health 
reasons. I have been having medi-
cal problems, and my doctor told 
me to settle down," Marchick said . 

The Vice President of External 
Affairs works at least forty hours a 
week. The person in this elected 
position supervises the UC Student 
Association undergraduate repre-
sentative and the Lobby Annex 
director, and serves as a tiason 
between the university and the com-
munity. 

Eric Basil , Personnel Relations 
Director, is covering the position 
until the three week process of 
appointing a new vice president is 
completed. Dave Marchick , A.S. 
President (and second cousin to Jill 
Marchick) will review applications 
with the assistance of A.S. Council 

members. The applicant then must 
be approved by the A.S. Council 
and will hold office until the regular 
elections in the spring. 

Dave Marchick says he will be 

appointing a person with "motiva-
tion, experience, knowledge of the 
position, enthusiasm, ability to work 
with others and who is able to learn 

. See RESIGN, page 3 

Though Jill Marchick has resigned from her A.S. post, she still plans 
on taking an active role in student government. 

Chancellor Atkinson wins 
court appeal in 'deceit' case 
By JAMES GILMORE 
Stall Writer 

The California Fourth Appellate 
DIstrict Court on Sept. 25 upheld a 
1985 Superior Court judgment 
which ruled that former Harvard 
professor Dr. Lee Perry could not 
claim damages from UCSD Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson on the 
basis of fraud in an alleged oral 
agreemt:nt that Atkinson would 

impregnate Perry. 
Perry argues that in 1977, after 

becoming pregnant while involved 
in one affair with Atkmson, he 
"tricked" her into her aborting her 
child by promising to impregnate 
her the following year. Perry said 
she was morally and ethically op-
posed to abortion, but was finally 
penluaded after Atkinson promised 
her he would later conceive a child 
with her either by sexual inter-

course or artificial insemination. 
Because Atkinson later refused to 
impregnate her, in February 1981 
Perry initiated legal proceedings , 
charging fraud and deceit and intent 
to inflict emotional distress. 

Atkinson admitted in court doc-
uments that he was married to his 
present wife when he had the affair 
with Perry , and that he did not want 
Perry to have her baby because he 
was worried that a child born out of 
wedlock would prevent him from 
becoming a university president 
and would force him to tell his wife 
about Perry . 

In a settlement obtained after the 
Superior Court trial began, Perry 
accepted $250,000 from Atkinson 
to drop her claims against him for 
emotional distress, yet she pre-
served her right to appeal the issue 
of whether or not Atkinson com-
mitted libel by deceiving her into 
having an abortion. 

On Feb. 3, 1986 the Superior 
Court enetered judgment in favor 
of Atkinson. The court reasoned 
that the law prohibits the govern-
ment from becoming involved in 
promises between adults concern-
ing intimate matters involving pro-

Cut nerves found 
to join better 
when frozen first -
B, RANDAU BLACK 

Univeraity of California, Irvine researcher. have demonIIrated 
that an experimental method of reconnecting severed nerva it 
aignificantly more effective than the traditional autuMg technique 
that ia in wide clinical uae. 

The procedure, called "freeze-trim," employa cold to harden the 
end. of nervea 50 that they may be cut 011 aquarely before 
reconnection. 

The UCI reaearchera report that the technique reaulta in about 70 
percent return of motor control after reuniq levered peripheral 
nervea, cOll\pared to 15 to 20 percent recovery achieved through 
the epineurial auturinc method. 

"We believe that thia freeze·trim technique wiD eventually revolu-
tionize aurp:al repU 01 nervea and improve the quality of life for the 
patienta," &aid John Swett, principal investigator and profeaaor of 
anatomy and neurobiology at the UCI College of Medicine. 

After a bundle of nervea is severed by injury, the branchea of 
nerve cells deatined for the akin and muadea become leparated from 
their cell bodiea, located in or near the central nervoua ayatem, and 
degenerate. MUlde paralyaia, 10 .. of aenaalion or both uauaJly 
reaulta. 

However, microscopic channels that remain within those aepar-
ated nerve parta can act aa conduib for new neuron branches that 
attempt to regenerate and make new functional connections with 
tikin and muacle. 

Durina the standard epineuriaI attachment, the cut ends of the 
_ryes are deformed much in the .. me way that two bundlea of wet 
........ Ii would be deformed if preued together .... let ...t. Cut 
nerve enda become muahroom ahaped shortly after being cut. 

Preaaing the enda together wiD caule many of the regrowing 
neuron aproub to travel in directions at right anglea from the desired 
path. Whether a neuron reaches its original target muacle "ia Hlen· 
baDya game of roulette," according to Swett. 

Freezing nerve enda and trimming them removea the mushroom-
like deformation and allows a aborter, more direct path for the 
regrowing nerve aproub to travel. A much larger proportion of the 
regenerating neurona are able to reach their proper targeta. 

The experimental technique hea been tried only in animala, but 
Swett and hill co-rele8rchera are hopeful it will be applied to repair of 
human peripheral nerve injuriea. 

The new technique may improve aignificantly the degree of 
recovery from paralyaia commonly experienced by thOle auffe"3 
from nerve injuries. (g

UCSD researchers inhibit 
atherosclerosis mechanism 

Researchers at the UCSD School of 
Medicine have significantly reduced the 
development of atherosclerosis in rabbits 
by interfering with the conversion of cir-
culating cholesterol to a form that leads 
to fatty build-up on the arterial walls_ 

Thomas Carew, M_D_, associate 
adjunct professor of medicine and princi-
pal author of the paper, said this is the 
first clear evidence that it is possible to 
interfere with atherosclerosis at the cellu-
lar level in an animal model. By prevent-
ing a key process that changes circulat-
ing fat molecules and causes them to 
stick to the artery walls, the researchers 
cut the incidence of atherosclerosis in 
rabbi ts by 50 percent. 

This finding . reported in the current 
issue of the Proceedings of the National 
Academy o( the Sciences (No_ 21) , 
opem a new avenue for intervening in the 
disease process unrelated to blood choles-
terollevels_ 

"There is no question that lowering 
blood cholesterol levels with diet and 
medication is extremely important, but 
that is only part of the equation_ Many 
people with normal blood cholesterol lev-
els still develop atherosclerosis," Carew 
said . "We are looking at how the body 
metabolizes low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL), the form of cholesterol implicated 
In atherosclerosis. Our hope is that this 
work will lead to combination therapies 
that employ cholesterol· lowering drugs , 
diet , and drug that inhibit LDL 
metabolism." 

He stressed that additional studies 
must be completed before thi; work could 
conceivably have human application. He 
said, however , it is a major step toward 
understanding and developing better 
treatments for atherosclerosis. 

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the 
build-up of fatty deposits on the artery 
wall. This blockage eventually clogs the 
arteries and leads to coronary artery dis-
ease, the major cause of death by disease 
in the United States.

Doctors advise precautions 
against influenza, pneumonia 

Although Southern Californians escape 
snow and freezing temperatures, they are 
just as susceptible to influenza as their 
northern neighbors. With cold and flu 
season about to begin, prevention , in the 
form of vaccination, is the best course of 
action, according to Dr. Diane Cross, a 
UCSD Medical Group general internist 
with a special interest in geriatrics. 

" Influenza vaccinations are strongly 
recommended for individuals over 65 
years of age; people with chronic disease; 
people who live in chronic care facilities; 
health care workers; and vaccinations 
can be requested by anyone who wants 
one," she said. 

However, the greatest threat presented 
by influenza is that it reduces resistance 
to secondary bacterial infections, which 
can be very dangerous for people with 
chronic lung disease. Pneumonia can 
result , and it can be deadly, Cross said. 

Young, healthy people who contract 
influenza may not need to see a physi-
cian, since there is no drug that can elim-
inate 'he virus. Bed rest, fluids and 
aspirin or aspirin substitutes may help 
relieve symptoms. 

The flu vaccine now available protects 
against the three types of influenza which 
are expected to be prevalent this year_ 
They are, as identified by the Center for 
Disease Contol (CDC): Taiwan and 
Leningrad . both influenza Type-A, and 
Ann Arbor, influenza Type-B. Annual 
vaccinations are required because 
influenza viruses change from year to 
year and antibodies made by the body in 
previous years don't recognize the new 
strains. 

The risks of the flu vaccine are small 
and side effects are usually minor. 

" Many people are still afraid that the 
side effects of the injection are worse than 
getting influenza," Cross said. "That isn't 
the case. Patients may experience sore-
ness at the sIte of the injection and some 
people may have a slightly elevated 
temperature or chills for day ." 

Individuals allergic to eggs and egg 
products should not be vaccinated, she 

added. 
A drug called amantadine has also 

proven effective in treating influenza if 
administered shortly after symptoms 
appear . This reduces the patient's risk of 
developing a potentially serious secon-
dary infection . 

Cross also recommends that everyone 
over the age of 60 and individuals with 
chronic lung disease be vaccinated for 
pneumococcal pneumonia, the most pre-
valent type of pneumonia. 

Scripps research ship visits 
Pitcairn Island 

A research ship from UCSD's Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography, on an expedi-
tion in the southeast Pacific Ocean, deli-
vered nearly one ton of materials to the 
isolated villagers at Pitcairn Island in 
early October. 

A team of marine scientists conducting 
a four-month expedition on board the 
245-foot research vessel Melville stopped 
at Pitcairn Island, home of the descend-
ants of the British sailor. who mutinied 
on the HMS Bounty in 1789. Chief 
scientist for the expedition is Dr. Harmon 
Craig, a professor of geochemistry and 
oceanography at Scipp' Institute at the 
University of Calfornia, San Diego. 

Melville left San Diego on September 
16 and is scheduled to return to its home 
port on Jan. 5, 1988. The principal 
science mission on the expedition is to 
study the distribution of he~um in the 
waters and volcanic rocks of the Pacific 
Ocean, which involves collecting water 
samples at sea and rocks from a variety 
of volcanic islands and seamounts. Biol-
ogists on board the ship are also collect-
ing plankton in net tows. 

Speaking by radio from ship to 
Scripps , Craig said that most of the 
island's 50 residents came out to Melville 
in 40-foot longboats during the two days 
the research ship was anchored off the 
island. 

"The islanders came along side the 
ship with the longboats that they handle 
with superb skills , and there was tre-
mendous excitement and happiness," 
Craig said. " It was a scene of great activo 
ity. Most of the Pitcairners came onto the 
Melville and while some were working at 
lowering and loading goods into their 
boats, the others set up lillie stores on the 
deck of the ship to sell carvings, paint-
ings, photographs, books, and all sorls of 
things that they produce, including 
T-shirts." 

Melville had been loaded in San Diego 
with supplies requested by radio by the . 
Pilcairners and supplied by their friends 
in the United States. Among the goods 
were building materials , an off-road vehi-
cle, diesel fuel, clothes, toys. a nd other 
personal items. 

UCSD's five colleges 
host preview day 

The University of California, San 
Diego will host Preview Day, Satufday , 
Nov. 7, sponsored by the UCSD Office 
of Student Outreach and Recruitment. 
The program will be from 10 am until 
1: 15 pm. Campus tours will begin at 
1:30 pm. 

Preview Day provides interested stu-
dents and parents an opportunity to learn 
more about UCSD. Staff members from 
UCSD's student services and academic 
departments will. give presentations and 
representatives from campus housing, 
student financial services and undergrad-
uate admissions will provide information. 

Representatives from UCSD's five 
undergraduate colleges will also provide 
information. (UCSD's Fifth College, 
which will emphasize international stu-
dies, will begin enrollment of new under-
graduate students in the fall of 1988.) 

Those who are unable to attend Pre· 
view Day will have another opportunity 
'to obtain information about UCSD on 
Monday , Nov. 9 . The Office of Student 
Outreach and Recruitment will host two 
general information sessions and campus 
tours. The first session wiU begin at 9 am

Scripps oceanographer wins prestigious prize 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
New. Editor 

A UCSD re sea rc her was 
awarded what many consider to be 
the equivalent of a Nobel Prize by 
Columbia University, it was an-
nounced Tuesday. 

Dr. Harmon Craig, an oceano-
grapher and geochemist at UCSD's 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography 
(SIO), will receive the Vetlesen 
Prize tonight along with Columbia 
scientist Wallace S. Broecker. The 
Vetlesen Prize, consisting of a gold 
medal and $50,000 for each recip-
ient, recognizes "achievement in 
the sciences resulting in a clearer 
understanding of the Earth, its his-

have, between them, done more to 
characterize the chemistry of the 
oceans and its exchange with the 
atmo 'phere and the solid earth 
than any other scientists anywhere. 
The implications of their work have 
been vas!." 

Craig earned his Ph.D. in geo-
logy-geochemistry from the Uni-
versity of Chicago in 1951, and 
joined Scripps in 1955 , where he 
has been every since. He is the 
author or co-author of over 130 
scientific papers and has served as 
chief scientist of more than 20 
scientific expeditions , including one 
that just returned from the South 
Pacific where Craig was studying

according to a Columbia Univer-
sity statement. 

Noting that there is no Nobel 
Prize for geochemistry or oceano-
graphy, Dr. Edward A . Frieman, 
SIO Director, saId that "[the 
Vetlesen Prize] is the major award 
in the world for all the earth scien-
ces ... Craig is a very brilliant, orig-
inal researcher, and has a great 
mind ." 

The two scientists were awarded 
the prize because. according to a

According to Chuck Colgan , a 
spokeman for Scripps, Craig is 
studying the plumes of methane 
and helium that flow out of vents in 
the ocean floor. He both finds the 
source of the gases, and , in an 
ingenuous use of natural resources, 
uses the gases, instead of artificial 
radioactive isotopes, to trace ocean 
currents. 

Colgan described Craig as an 
"internationally renowned, active, 
seagoing scientist. . . [who, at age 
61,] shows no indication of slowing

down whatsoever." 
Examples of past work by Craig 

include the analysis of gases trapped 
in Greenland ice , which revealed 
that the amount of atmospheric 
methane has doubled over the past 
300 years . Methane is a gas which 
contributes to the so-called "green-
house effect ," or a rise in the a ver-
age temperature of the earth 's 
atmosphere as higher levels of gases 
such as methane and carbon diox-
ide are released into the '!V. 

In addition. Craig, together with 
Broeker, formed the Geochemical 
Ocean Sections Study, described 
by the Columbia University state-
ment as a "multi-institutional and 
international oceanographic project 
begun in 1970 to investigate the 
chemical and isotopic properties of 
the global oceans. " It adds that the 
program "produced one of the most 
complete sets of global ocean 
chemistry ever gathered and trig-
gered what is widely considered to 
be a revolution in chemical ocean-
ography. " 

Georg unger Vetlesen, a Nor· 
wegian who became a U.S. citizen 
during World War II, established 
the prize named after him in 1959 
at Columbia University . 

The Vetlesen Prize has been 
awarded irreguarly since 1960, 
depending on whether the selection 
commillee felt there was a deserv-
ing recipient for a particular year. 
The last time it was awarded was in 
in 1981 , and Broecker and Craig 
are only the eleventh and twelfth 
recipients of the Prize . (g

Understanding the co-ops 
By THOMAS J. CANTY 

Two letters to the editor have 
been wri tten to the Guardian con -
cerning UCSD Co·op leases. I feel 
both have caused a degree of con-
fusion. In order to clarify this issue 
it is necessary to gain an under-
standing of the relationship between 
the UCSD Co-ops and the Univer-
sity Center Board (UCB) and some 
of the history involving both . 

There are two student legislative 
bodies, whose decisions affect the 
Student Center and the organiza-
tions using the facility . The UCB 
and the Associated Student Coun-
cil (A.S.) both make decisions 
affecting student organizations, on-
campus businesses, and various 
academic and social student 
services. 

At the beginning of each fiscal 
year, the UCB reviews and ap· 
proves the proposed budget for the 

_upcoming year . 

The budget includes the follow· 
ing "Activity Center's": The Stu-
dent Center Administration , the 
Craft Center, the Graduate Stu-
dents, the Students Center Busi-
ness Office , Reservations and 
Facility Usage, Student Informa-
tion Services (EDNA), the Triton 
Pub , the UCSD Bike Shop , House-
keeping , Maintenence, and Co-ops 
(The Recycling Co-op, the Compu-
ter Science Co-op , Groundwork 
Books, and the Farm Co-op -
Hereafter referred to a s the consu· 
mer co-ops or CC). 

The sources of income for the 
budget are: the $37 .50 University 
Center fee , rent payments, loan 
payments, vending machines, the 
vice chancellor of undergraduate 
affairs debt service, and investment 
income. 

In addition to the budget, the 
UCB allocates the available space 
in the Student Center to registered 
student organizations. 

The UCB established the poli-
cies rega rding the daily representa-
tives on the UCB: one representa-
tive from each college, a co-op 
representative, a graduate student 
representative , an A.S. representa-
tive, and a Stude nt Affirmative 
Action Committee (SAAC) rep-
resentative . 

There is a non· voting chairper-
son to run the meetings . The Uni -
verstiy Center director acts as an 
advisor to the board and is respon -
sible for the implementation of UCB 
decisions.

The quality of 
education at UCSD 

Editor: 
Teach: to communicate knowl· 

edge or skill. 
School: an institution for teach· 

ing and learning (Webster's defi-
nitions). 

Given these two definitions, it is 
safe to assume that: 

1 ) a university is a school 
2) the primary job of the teacher 

is to teach 
Wrong. At least , in many easel, 

the second of these axioms is vio· 
lated. In other words, often the 
teacher is more concerned with 
"getting through the book" than 
teaching the material. 

To iUustrate this point more clear· 
Iy I will give an ex~ple (the names 

have been changed to protect the 
innocent). 

Joe, a student, was in a General 
Chemiltry course. To Joe's sur-
prise, his was the only course whiz-
zing through an entire chapter every 
two lectures without fail. Others 
enrolled in the same class taught by 
a different profel5or were nowhere 
near such a pace. Joe was con-
fused. The teacher seemed to have 
no concern with anything but com-
pleting the book by the end of the 
quarter. 

Joe went to Oasis tutoring ses-
sions. Frequently he could not solve 
the lample problems. Joe was frus-
trated. How could he be expected 
to solve problems fourth year chem-
istry majors failed to understand? 
Joe asked others in his clalS. They 
offered to help, but were frequently 

unable. 
The midterm loomed. Joe was 

lost. He studied hard, got all the 
help he could, took the test - got a 
C. A C? Joe was among the lucky 
ones . His score was well above [the 
scores of) many of his feDow class· 
mates. Joe went to speak to the 
prof. 

"Obviously, Joe, you should im-
prove your study habits. You're not 
trying hard enough. Maybe you 
should hire a private tutor. Good 
day ." 

Joe was nonpluued. A private 
tutor? Even if he did drive a Porshe 
and vomited money everywhere he 
went, what good would a tutor do 
him? He'd already been to Oasis 
- the "best on campus." Even 
when they did help, wasn't it the 
teacher's job to teach the material, 
not the teacher's assistants'? Joe

regularly sent representatives to 
the C&E meetings. C&E operatel 
in a collective manner: consensus 
decision making is used to arrive at 
solutions. In other words, an item is 
discussed until everyone unanim. 
ously agrees upon a final decision, 
as opposed to voting and accepting 
what the majority decides . In 
general, the co-ops operate in the 
118me manner. C&E recognizes the 
C.C. , KSDT, and the new indica-
lor as participants in the inter co·op 
benefit system, therefore these are 
the only student organizations rec-
ognized a. CO-Opl, 

The A.S. provides funding for: 

student organizations other than 
the C.C. , campus elections, admi-
nistrative and student 118laries, Soft 
Reserve., KSDT, A.S. Lecture 
Notes, Alsorted Vinyl and the 
Grove Calle. The A.S. budget 
Income is from the campul activity 
fee. However, the UCB budgets lor 
services, such as utilities or main· 
tenance, for everybody . Therefore 
it is difficult to say that the A.S. is 
solely responaible for anybody's 
budget. 

Co-op funding 

The UCSD co·ops have histori· 
cally obtained the following types 

of funding from the student fees 
through the UCB: Start up funds 
for initial equipment and stock pur-
chases, expansion funding for the 
purchase of new equipment, main-
tenance contracts lor the equip-
ment purchased, programming 
money for C&E events, money for 
specific educational proposals (i.e. 
sending co-op members to the co-
ops, the Student Center Board (now 
UCB) felt they could begin to pay 
rent to cover the remaining debt 
service on the Student Center. The 
agreement between the administra-
tion and the co-ops took the form of 
the controversial leases.

"Of course," he thouiht, " the 

teacher can't pouibly be at fault. I 
must be responsible lor most of the 
class flunking out." 

Joe dropped the course in frus-
tration and di.illulionment. 

The above example is a true 
story, and a sad one. Granted, 
most students' failures lay with the 
students themselves. Individual reo 
sponsibility cannot be stressed 
enough in today's "pass the buck" 
society . However, it should not be 
assumed that it is always and with. 
out question entirely the student' 8 
fault when academic performance 
is poor. The instructor must take 
responsibility in cases where what 
is "taught" is not being learned. 
Teaching does not mean the me-
chanical regurgitation of a text-
book into a lecture, It does not

mean trying to cram a text into a 
student's head before the final. 
Teaching is the communication of 
knowledge or skill, an activity of 
immeasurable value when an ex-
change of understanding is incur-
red. 

However, when an instructor/-
teacher fails [in) this and drifts into 
the realm of robotic reiteration, a 
terrible wickedne .. has taken place; 
instead of a true attempt to teach, 
the professor, along with the rest of 
the class, endeavors to remain con-
scious during the lecture period, 
Who can truly afford to waste such 
amounts of time? 

Simply, a teacher should teach. 
If the students are failing to under. 
stand, both the instructor, as well 
as the instructed, should LEARN 
the reason why.

Co-op leases 

The issues of co·op leases is a 
misleading one. Originally the 
leases were an agreement between 
Roland Buck, the Student Center 
Director in 1979, and the co·ops. 
Jim Carruthers felt the term lease 
was inappropriate because a "lease" 
is a legal agreement between the 
two parties. Tht' co·ops are not 
entities separate from the Uni-
versity. 

The reason the term "lease" was 
used instead of "agreement" was to 
reinforce future Core members how 
important it was to keep the agree· 
ment.ln a leiter to the editor, Evan 
Wiessenfeld and Andrew Chane 
mention how, up until now, the past 
Student Center directors "blindly" 
signed the leases. 

It seems to me it was fin advan-
tageous source of income for the 
UCB: and using the term "blindly" 
seems to infer that past Student 
Center directors did not know what 
they were doing. 

They also assert that "the reason 

S . R. infers in her leiter that the 
leases deny space. The co·ops exist 
because students saw a demand for 
the services they provide. Although 
the leases do not guarantee any 
space , they are a demonstration of 
the administrative support or lack 
thereof . By not signing the "leases" 
Jim Carruthers has caused many 
people to evaluate why the on· 
campus co·ops exist. 

However , the lease issue is 
merely one aspect of a larger 
debate : How are the co·ops ac· 
countable to the students? Is it 
necessary for co·ops to concede 
any of their autonomy in order to 
accountable? In following issues of 
the Guardian I will review some of 
the history of the co·op and why the 
current debate exists .

Perry's case is the fourth "sexual 
deceit" suit known to have been 
filed in California . In one of those 
cases, the court held that a man 
must still pay child support even if 
the child's mother had misrepres· 
ented her use of birth control, be· 
cause the "right to privacy" pro· 
tects the parties from suits arising 

from their failure to use birth con· 
trol. However, the two remaining 
cases hold that a woman may sue 
for fraud when she has suffered 
physical harm, such as ectopic 
pregnancy (development of ovum 
outside the uterus), or venereal dis · 
ease, after she has relied on her 
sexual partner's misrepresentations 
of sterility or health. The right of

"I see this as a feminist issue, " 

Perry said . " By deceit, I was denied 
my constitutional right to choice 
and autonomy. An abortion based 
on a lie is not based on true con· 
sent. Either I'm wrong," Perry con· 
tinued, "or this is a kind of leading. 
edge type of case that people are 
trying to apply traditional catego·

up the promotional ladder so far, and then 
you're stopped cold." 

Speaking in a tone which is both kind 
and cautious, QuiMt4llfnlttlltribute dMa to 
any malevolence bn the1Jart ' of male-
members of the academic hierarchy, but 
rather to tacit prejudices hidden within the 
system. According to Quinn, somehow it 
seems safer to promote the man first. 
"Some departments are afraid of women. 
They think they're going to be radical or 
something," shc said. 

Her concern about this issue will soon 
surface in the form of a five year study on 
worldwide hiring practices in anthropology 
departments. The data for her book should 

be gathered by January of 1989, "So far, 
results show that (poor females hiring 
ratio) is a pocket phenomenon". Academic 
departments with a healthy percentage of 
female profenors will be sitting right next-
door to a heavily male dominated one. 

nUai-cipoiogy departments, however, 
traditionally tend to be more open to 
women than most. Quinn said that in terms 
of her own subject area of gender studies. 
anthropology, are earned by women nation· 
ally, which makes this field especiaJly 
attractive to female scholars. This, she 
suggested, compares with an overall of 
about one third PhD's for females in all 
subject areas. In light of these figures, it is 
even more suprising that UCSD has no 
regular female faculty in the anthropology

Lost La Jollans NaOOli Quinn 

By ROBERT LEONE 
Staff Writ.r 

I I's that season again, where lost La Jollans, looking for "the theater" or "the lecture," sprout 
like mushrooms all over the grass 
and concrete of UCSD. 

Visitors in aerobics shoes, navy 
blue blazers, and Mercedes Benzes 
ask people for coherent directions 
to some unspecified building . 

It's enough to make you pretend 
YOl!o don't speak English. People 
ask you where "the ~brary" is. 

There is a certain sadistic joy to b e 
gained in naming five or six of 
UCSD's libraries, by the most con-
fusing names possible ("Cluster", 
"S&E" etc.) and asking them which 
library they wanted . 

They asked for "the swimming 
pool." They ask for "the alhletic 
field ." They ask for "the dormato· 
ries." "The cafeteria." The campus 
sadists probably give very accurate 
directions to the nearest cafeteria. 
The lost La Jollans ask you for the 
single location of campus facilities 

and divisions and work-units which 
you probably have never heard of. 

It's not some poor (actually rich ) 
La Jollan 's fault that he or she has 
not bad intimate daily contact with 
the university. They simply don' t 
know their way around. 

These off -campus hordes did how. 
ever foot the bill for the mass of 
concrete and stuccoed dry wall , we 
fondly call UCSD. This is afterall 
the University of California lor the 
people, and it's really hard to say 
"fiat lux" when all your guest are

department. 

Quinn evidences her frustration 
with thele facts . She !laid that the 
"glaslI ceiling" hal confined her 
career as well. Sitting in a comfor· 
table office, surrounded by compu-
ter hardware, shelves and research 
work , Quinn discussed the stran-
gely deceptive picture of academic 
life. All Quinn describes it , the 
average student has no idea of the 
vicious politicking that goes on 
among professors. 

Part of the reason Quinn ac· 
cepted the one year position at 
UCSD was to get away from that 
side of academia . A relatively light 
course load here will allow her a 
great deal of free time to write her 
latest book. Quinn'li interest in her 
postion as research scentist became 
apparent as she discussed her enjoy-
ment of being buried in an office 
with her work . "Science is exciting 
in itself" she explained motioning to 
her office library and collection of 
recorded interviews that surround 
her. 

Quinn describes the topic of the 
book she's written as "the use of 
metaphors in American marriage." 
Her view is that marriages are 
shaped by our perception of what a 
good marriage should be. Accord -
ing to Quinn , people express their 
feelings on marriage in idealistic 
terms of rather than as how mar-
riages usually are in reality, "Our 
marriage is poured in cement. .. " 
suggesting that the marriage bond 
should be strong and lasting. "you 
wouldn't say 'our marriage is like 
tumbleweeds, for example". 

The book is based on a collec-
tion of interviews with married cou· 
pies form Duram, North Car06na. 
It is Quinn's first book , though she 
has recently co-edited a text in an· 
thropology entiled, "Cultural Mod-
els in Language and Thought". 

Often, the highlight of an anthro· 
pologist's career is the field work 
they do in their years of graduate 
study. F amoul anthropologists such 
as Evans-Prithchard , Malinowski , 
and Mead , have made lamous the 
gatherer.hunter tribes of Africa , 
and fishermen of Micronesia. Quinn 
had her days of adventure in Coas· 
tal Ghana , where she wrote a paper 
on the "compostition of fishing 
crews" of an African tribe. She 
smiled and described in tones sug· 
gestive of disbelief of how far away 
that work is from her present study. 
But, she added, "I don't regret hav. 
ing done it. It was a worthwhile 
experience" . 

Quinn did her undergraduate 
work at Radcliffe, and got her PhD 
from Stanford. She has now been 
at Duke University for 15 years , 
spending most of her time teaching , 
even though she considers herself a 
research scientist. In teaching she 
hopes to convince her students to 
"read r.opular science with jaun· 
diced eye." Her courses at U ::SD 
are concerned with comparing dif. 
ferent cultural beliefs and under· 
standings regarding gender. 

Quinn will be on campus for the 
full 87/88 academic year. For fe -
male scholars interested in infor-
mation on the National Science 
Foundation program which brought 
Quinn to San Diego, you can call

choices," Campbell said. 

She hopes to see these goals take 
shape as soon as she has the benefit 
of a full·time staff working for her. 

Campbell's own educational and 
professional background is diverse. 
She herself is a UC graduate, hav. 
ing received her B.A. from UC 
Irvine. She has studied abroad in 
programs concerning International 
Education. She received a master's 
degree in international communi. 
cations and student development 
from American University in 
Washington, D.C. 

She moved back to UC Irvine 
after graduating from American 
University and took the position of 
assistant American dean to student 
activities until she became assistant 
dean of Warren at UCSD, a posi. 
tion she held for five years until her 
recent promotion to dean of War· 
reno 

Campbell stresses her personal 
goal is to make herself available 
and approachable to students on 
ca mpus. 

Campbell says "it is important to 
know students' needs and maintain 
a relationship with them. " More· 
over, she feels it "personally grati-
fying" to help students or to hear 
about their own achievements. 

In discussing qualities that stu-
dents need to succeed at UCSD, 
Campbell remarked that most stu· 
dents already have the intelligence 
to succeed, but the quality of 
determination is needed to get 
through college - especially for 
the first year. Students need to s\ra-
tegize and make the bureaucracy 
work for them; they should become 
aware of the people on campus 
who can help them, CampbeU added. 

Campbell wants students to take 
risks and experiment with different 
areas of interest; this increases their 
marketability and also allows them 
to become more adaptable to 
changes. (g 

Lost on

Continued from page 9 
looking for TLH 104 out some·

So, when one of these benighted 
strangers comes up to you direc t 
him or her to the proper lo('ation. 
But it isn't always easy to know 
where the Center for Musical Ex. 
periment is when you've never gone 

,east of the Registrar's office. 
Often , giving accurate directions 

from one side of the campus to the 
other is incredibly complex . Part of 
the reason is that UCSD does not 
have departments of geogra phy or 
cartography. Mostly though, it is 
the construction sites that have 
made driving through campus a 
nigh tmare . So you might as well 
direct the lost La Jollans to the one 
group of people on campus who 
KNOW what's happening , and 
more importantly, where it 's 
happening. 

Send 'em to Edna, the funny office 
just across from KSDT, the Box 
Office, and the Check Cashing 
Lady . At Edna, • i Student Infor. 
mation, they have almost every 
kind of map of UCSD that 's around. 
Their staff would probably be mao 
joring in Cartography if it were an 
option here. Edna even knows 
where the Center for Musical Ex. 
periment is. If they don't know 
where some location or event is, the

By ERIN NORASCH 

Last spring, when Denise 
McFayden was accepted to 
UCSD, .he was told by a local 
community college coach that 
UCSD did not have a woman's 
cross country team. 

UCSD CrolS country coach 
Mark Sanforth attributes her 
success to equal parts hard work 
and natural talent. Denise is 
already a good runner and, 
according to Sanforth, has the 
potential within her "to become 
an outstanding college runner." 
As a freshman, McFayden has 
had four first place fini.hes in six 
races, running a consistent sub-
six minute mile time over the 3.1 
mile women's course. 

In high school, McFayden 
didn't really excel at cross· 
country until her senior year, but 
by then it wils too late to be 
offered an athletic scholarship to 
a Division I or II school. She 
came to UCSD solely because 
of its academic reputation. Dur· 
ing the summer, however, .he 
stumbled onto the erOa6 country 
program. A friend gave her 
name to coach Stanforth who 
contacted her in August about 
running for the team. Until then, 
McFayden didn't know UCSD 
had a team. McFayden ran con-

tinuo~ly during the aummer 
because "once you start, it', too 
hard to .tart again," and her 
training has paid off. A steady 
diet of continual running, sev· 
eral10K's, and a half·marathon 
has led to her continued devel-
opment as a runner and her .uc-
cess this year. 

The difference between high 
school and college, McFayden 
say., has been that everyone 
takes running more seriously. 
"No one is going to .kip work· 
outs. " Training 45 to 50 miles a 
week, as the croll country team 
does, alternating di.tance run·

ning and speed work, takesded-
ication_ The time commitment, 
training, and races make self -
discipline even more important 
considering her main reason for 
being at UCSD is the academ-
ics. Still McFayen adds that it's 
not hard to balance school and 
athletics if you know how to stay 

ahead, "taking school in little 
bunches." 

Running is a way for her to 
relax and stay in shape. Mc-
Fayden hasn't seen any signs of 
burn-out and hasn't Jet the pres-
sure get to her. Cross country is 
a very individual sport, without 
real recognition or fanfare. 
Denise credits family and friends 

for supporting her and re lieving 
some of the pressure she puts on 
herself. Admittedly. she has pre-
race jitters, but once she starts 
running, everything falls into 
rhytm . For McFayden, running 
Division II I has helped remove 
some of the pressure , as she 
doesn't have to earn her keep 
scholarship-wise. The only ex-
pectaions she has to live up to 
are the ones she sets for herself. 

With more experience a nd a 
chance to learn from her mis-
takes (her last race, on an un-
familiar course, she made a 
wrong turn, lost 30 seconds, 
and wound up finishing 14th) 
McFayden should get even bet-
ter. Coach Stanforth looks for 
Denise McFayden to have a 
good chance to finish in the top 
five in next week 's regiona ls in 
Northern California. UiJ

Floor Hockey Update: 
Women Take The Spotlight 
For those of you who haven't seen much 

action on the footbalilields, better come to the 
Reckerdome. aka Rec Gym. and check oul the 
fast and exciting game 01 floor hockey No raon· 
outs here, and no scab games eltherl 
remember how exciting the "miracle on Ice" 
was at t~e 1980 Winter OlympICS? Well. the 
action and the intensity level comes pretty 
close to that And as lar level 01 play IS 
concerned, It isn't the Canada Cup series, but it 
does come close. Floor hockey wasn't always 
that competitive at UCSD. Why the change all 
01 a sudden? The Women. 

The women of UCSD are coming into their 
own. and are now starting to domonate what 
was once a male dominated sport. The women 
have always played well . buf not like thiS year 
They own the game now. On certain teams, 
they lead the team In scoring, and on some 
teams they ARE the teaml 

Of all ladles playing the Sport. sharp shooter 
Carolyn "H A " Hollman stands out She can, 
and usually does, score from anywhere on the 
lIoor Unconfirmed report has It that she 
actually turned down an Invitation to play on 
the OlympIC Team An InSide source has 
revealed to me that the real reason was that 
the OlympIC Committee could not buyout the 
contract Hollman signed With the MUir 
ReSident Dean's Ollice Also, you can't 
overlook the line play. not to mention hair of Jill 
'The Boz" Vanderwolk And If you add the solid 

defenSive work of Lisa Giorgio" FlOro you can 
eaSily see why Quan Is Gone IS # 1 ranked In 
all of UCSD 

You also can t forget the All-1M athlete 
" M B MUrray She makes Ron Hextall of the 
Flyers look like a sieve She allows a measly 
one goal per game Without her. AtomiC 
Hammer would be In serious troubte The 
seasoned veteran, Jennifer "Caplslrano" 
Culler, and newcomer Vanessa "Clubbers' 
Yongllng carry the bulk ollhe load for Capt 
Dick and HIS Seamen 

In AA the play IS dominated by N~ncy 
Oflsldes" Collins and Dana Crompton Without 

the services of these two, Out of Control 
certainly wouldn t be number one Then there 's 
the women of Biohazards all 01 Ihem The 
perennial cellar dwellers are now a team to be 
reckoned With In AA Apparently these women 
have been receiving private Instructions from 
the hockey guru of UCSD Whatever the 
reason . thiS IS dellnltley a team where the 
Women are the team 

The leading scorer In all of 1M 1I00r hockey 
comes from a Single A team Pam "The 
Scoring Machine" Saldana has tallied eight 
goals already She IS Virtually unstoppable. 
Thus far she has outplayed. outperformed. and 
outscored AII · IM performers like Richie "Gel a 
Real Job" Troop, Steve "The Guru" Kent, and 
even Jell "I Can Score At Will " Iko 

With Ihese ladles playing lhe way they do, it 
IS easy 10 see why the lIoor hockey program 
doesn't believe In the ERA The women of 
UCSD have shown that they don 't need II The 
way these ladles play II won 't be long before 
we see women In the NHL

BudMan Approves New North 
Center Recreation Field Complex 

Final approval has finally been given by 
yours truly to begin work on the largest recrea · 
tion complex ever bUilt at UCSD The new area 
Will be localed north of Ihe Super Computer It 
Will run from the middle 01 the curreen1 Mile 
High Field all the way out to Genessee 11 you 
don 't hve In the beautiful North County, and 
commute out Old Highway 101 , then you 
haven't seen tha t qUite a bll of work has 
already been done on the prolect. Between 
John Hopkins Drive (which no longer eXists) 
and Old Highway 101 , Ihere is not a tree in 
Sight (darn beavers!) and the land IS being 
leveled. If you look at the area, you can get an 
idea of how much room there Will be out Ihere . 
Three. Pilau 

The complex Will be bUilt in three phases. 
The ftrSI Will be 1he 'Super Field '. This will be 
one gigantic field that Will be 1000'x500'. To 
give you an Idea 01 how big Ihat is, MUir Field is 
300'x300'. It 's hard to Imagine SIX 1M foolball 
games at once, or SIX 1M softball games 
Whewl That's a big field . 

Also Included In Ihe Ilfst phase Will be a 
locker/olilce/weight room complex that Will 
cost $1 .2 million and Will be donated by the 
San Diego Chargers Of course, they aren 't 
dOing that out 01 Ihe kindness of thelf hearts 
They Will be uSing the fields and building two 

months out of the year lor their tra ining site. 
The university will use the lacllity the resl 
of the year 

Phase One has to be completed by July t , 
1988 as Ihe contracl stipulates with the 
Chargers. so for all you Freshmen, Sopho· 
moles, Juniors, Ilfth, Sixth, and seventh year 
Seniors, you can look forward to using thiS 
beautifyl new area next fall . 
, Phase Two Will include an all ·weather Tartan 
track. The first class track faCility will also have 
room for a football field With sealing. If UCSD 
ever lakes the big lump to intercollegiate 
football 

Phase Three will be the creation of a new 
main entrance to the campus from the North. It 
Will Include beautilullandscaping and a vlsilor 
mall wtlh tree· lined streets leading into Ihe 
campus. 

Phase Four. or Ihe dream phase, Will be the 
large multi-purpose gymnasium which Will be 
able 10 pul us on par with all other U.C. cam-
puses as far as indoor facilities go. Hopefully, 
th iS Will happen soon. It would be nice not hav· 
ing to play Floor Hockey till 2:00 a m or to be 
able 10 have some really big bands In our

PHI DELT DREAM TEAM 
MEN'S AA VOLLEYBALL 

Due to the fact that the rain hindered the Bud Team picks this week. 
we were left with an 11:15 Sunday night Mens AA VOlleyball match which 
surprisingly turned out to be pretty darn exciting. 

A highly ranked Phi Delt D,..m Te.m took on a dark horse 
HODAD team. The Dream Team went into the match with a record of 
9-0 and the Hodads were 7-2. The first game ended with the dream 
team on top 15-9. Although the competition was tough. it looked as 
though they were on their way to another victory. Momentum changed 
hands in the second game when the scrappy little Hodad crew rallied to 
win 15-7, but the Division leading Phi De/ts proved to be too overpower-
ing. winning the final game 11-4. 

The rain turned out to be a blessing in disguise because the Bud Man 
could have asked for a more exciting match. Congratulations Draet Team 
- This Bud's For You and the rest of your season.

D irected and adapted for modern theatre aud-
iences by UCSD director Steve 
Pearson, the satire, "Vol-
pone," opens UCSD depart-
ment of theatre's 1987-88 
season on Nov. 6 at the Man-
ddl Weiss Center for the Per-
forming Arts . Written by Eli-
zabethan playwright Ben Jon-
son, "Volpone" is a robust 
and bawdy satire in which a 
pair of con men, Volpone and 
his cunning servant Mosca, 
concoct a scheme to rob the ' 
greediest and wealthiest citi-
zens of Venice. 

Pearson, an associate pro-
fes o r of theatre and head of 
the acting program at UCSD, 
who has studied movement, 
act ing , and directing with Ja-
p;lncse theatre ma ter Tadashi 

uzuki for more than six years, 

VlfWInG T~f V CfS Ot VOlPOnf 
incorporates hi s modern 
method of theatrical move-
ment in the comedy sequences 
of the play. Aq:ording to Pear-
son, the main difference in the 
training of the Suzuki method 
is that it is very specific and 
theatrica l, as opposed to the 
strength in the United States 
which comes from Stanslovski 
and the realistic traditio n of 
American actors. 

"Volpone" was written at 
the time of Shakespeare, and, 
Pearson said, "the play was 
[actually] first done at the 
Globe Theatre by the com-
pany that Shakespeare was 
working for and with, and, as 
a result, it is not a realistic 
play. Shakespeare's p lays are 
not realistic; they have ele-
ments of realism in them. In 
other words, [these plays] use 
some of the same techniques 
used in approaching reali stic 
theatre , but they are not real-
istic plays." 

Jonson's reputation and in -
fluen ce on English drama, for 
at least 1 00 years after his 
death, nearly equaled that of 
Shakespeare. A meticulous re-
searcher, Jonson severely criti -
cized other playwrights of his 
time , including Shakespeare, 
for errors and carelessness that 
he saw in their writings. In 
"Volpone," and in his other 
later satirical comedie ,humor 
is brought out as an aspect of 
universal human failing, such 
as greed, ignorance or super-
stition. 

According to Pearson, "Vol-
pone" can make use of mod-
ern techniques because 
elements of the Suzuki method 
are very specific and theatri-
cal. Pearson said, "It requires 
a different style of acting, and 
tyle of production - the 

kind of formal style that is 
prt:valent in Japanese theatre 
tS useful as a jumping-of( point; 
that i h w the uzuki method 

relates. It is only in that regard 
that we actors use this method 
[in this play]." 

He continued, " As part of 
our training [at UCSD], [the 
Suzuki method] is no t the 
entire thing that we do, but it 
allows American actors to have 
some different tools. For this 
pa rticular play, it is useful 
because it takes place in a 
place that is far from what we 
understand and the style of 
presentation is theatri ca\' 
heightened .... it has dark 
elements in it, but it is a 
comedy." 

Jonson 's play is a comedy in 
that it exposes the dark, deadly 
sins of lust and greed using 
satire and wit. Volpone feigns 
illness, staying abed to dupe 
his victims, while alternately 
scheming and cavorting in his 
quest for gold . Mos a enjoys 
cheating for the sake of it , and 
i motivated both by the lure 
of the game and his master's 

lust for riches . 
The cast, which is made up 

chiefly by graduate acting stu-
dents from UCSD's p rofes-
sional theat re training pro-
gram , is supported by under-
graduate acting students. Vol-
pone is portrayed by Deryl 
Caitlyn; Mosca by Giovanni 
Felicioni ; The Fool by Carolyn 
Sweeny; Voltore by Mathew 
Wright; Corbaccio by Craig 
Green ; Cornino by Jim Mor-
lino; Celia by Maggie Stewart; 
Bonario by Sean Whitesell ; 
and Lady Wouldbe by Mon-
ica Buckley . Undergraduates 
Thom Sherman, Marsee Skid-
more, John Godfrey and Alan 
Dibona play supporting roles. 

Performances of "Vol pone" 
will be 8 pm on Nov. 6 , 7, and 
11-14, and at 7 pm on Nov. 
8 . Tickets are $9 for general 
admission and $5 for students .

A Rebel superstar 
by eva wonK 

artl editor 

"American Rebel," a film which chronicles the life of 
Dean Reed - an all -American boy turned socialist super-
star who was literally and figuratively blacked out in the 
United States - will be shown as part of Committee for 
World Democracy 's (CWD) political film series. This 
film will be screened on Friday, Nov . 6 at 7 pm in TLH 
107. Director Will Roberts will be present at the showing 
to discuss and answer questions regarding this film. 

Roberts' first encounter with Reed was at the 1979 
Moscow International Film Festival. He had seen a man 
mobbed by hundreds of people in Red Square and asked 
his Russian interpreter who the man was. The interpreter 
had replied that he was Dean Reed, and could not believe 
Roberts did not know who Reed was, saying that Reed 
was known worldwide as being "the most famous Ameri-
can in the world ." 

Reed participated in various struggles around the 
world . In "American Rebel" there are scenes of Reed 
singing about Sacco and Varuetti in East Germany, and 
"We Shall Overcome" in Moscow. With a guitar in one 
hand and a gun in the other, Reed brought his message of 
solidarity and hope to Vietnam, Chile, Lebanon, Bangla-
desh and Nicaragua. 

Shortly after Reed announced his intention to move 
back to the U.S. in 1986, he was found dead. His fully 
clothed body was discovered at the bottom of a lake less 
than a mile from his home in East Germany.

A 
• naive 

past 
by jeff rev kleen 

staff wri ter 

For those who are tired of 
typical, Brat-pack, teen movies 
- there is hope. Surprisingly. 
this 'hope' comes from Yuogs-
lavia and is entitled, " Hey 
Babu Riba." The film, which 
is in Russian with English sub-
titles, is about the adventures 
of a group of teenagers in Bel-
grade during the politically-
turbulent 1950's. 

Four Yugoslavian men are 
brought together by the death 
of a mutal friend, Miriana 
Aivikovic, who they have not 
seen for over 30 years. Meet-
ing in Belgrade for the funeral , 
the men - who now live in 
New York, Paris, London, and 
Milan - reminisce back to 
the time when they were a 
successful crew team , jazz 
band, and all in love with their 
beautiful coxwain, Miriana. 

The film then flashes back 
to Belgrade in 1953. The five 
teenagers are infatuated with 
American movies and music. 
Miriana is nicknamed ~"Es­
ther" after their screen idol, 
Esther Williams. Into their 
happy lives suddenly comes 
Rile Ristic, an aide to an in-

. fluential member of the Com-
munist Party. Somewhat older 
than the group, Rile, who takes 
on the English name "Joe," is 
attracted to Miriana. But, the 
closely knit "foursome" are

"Hey Babu Riba " is a re-
freshing film . Because the 
actors and actresses are virtual 
unknowns in America, it's easy 
to accept them as the charac-
ters they portray. The charac-
ters themselves are wonder-
fully innocent . They're in-
terested in music rather than 
drugs. Native to modern wor-
ries over AIDS, they ex-
perience sex and American 
cigarettes for the first time 
with child-like charm. 

But "Hey Babu Riba" goes 
beyond the simple exploits of 
teenagers. The undercurrents 
of the politically ambiguous 
future of Yugoslavia create a

between Communism amd Ti-

a bat tleground between west-

many ways.

Internationally-acclaim-

Mikey Dread ~ 'whu pro-

a few years ago in London 
- appears at "Reggae 
Splash '87," this Saturday,

Queen Eckanem and Vi-
belsmash from L.A., as 
well as local bands Night-

Cardiff Reefers, and 
Xango. 

Admission is free for 
this unprecedented UCSD 
event, coordinated by A.S. 
Commissioner of Program-
ming, Perenthesis (PO) 
Devers . He believes that 
the campus needs more 
events to promote cultu-
ral awareness - like the 
UCSD Jazz Festival. "Reg-
gae deserves a special ex-
posure that is lacking at 
the university . This music 
is very moving , so it ca'l

Devers said . 

Assisted by DJs from 
91X and KSDT, Devers 
looked at San Diego reg-
gae bands this past sum-
mer, noting their large 
local followings . The other 
bands were also excited 
about performing at a 
major show in San Diego. 
" It's the spirit of reggae. 
The bands thought it 
would be a great cause to 

play together," Devers 
noted. 

" Reggae Splash '87" 
takes the title from the 
annual "Jamaican Sun 
Splash" - a renowned 
musical celebratio n . 
" People come to Jamaica 
from all over the world 
just to kick back with each 
other and listen to reggae 
for an entire day," Devers

Floyd finds Reason 
by larry weintraub 

hiatul itaff writer 

Four years haVe passed since 
Pink Floyd released their last 
studio album, "The Final 
Cut," and fans have never 
given up hope that someday 
there would be at least one 
more. Floyd fans can rest easy 
now that the band's latest 
effort, "Momentary Lapse of 
Reason," has hit the record 
stores. 

Although the crucial input 
of former Floyd bassist and 
chief songwriter, Roger 
Waters, no longer exists, the 
band has still managed to 
submit an excellent piece of 
work that is significantly true 
to the Pink Floyd sound. 

Formed by bassist Roger 
Waters, with singer, guitarist, 
and songwriter Syd Barrett, 
Pink Floyd entered the Lon-
don psychedelic scene in 1966. 
With the addition of drummer 
Nick Mason and keyboardist 
Richard Wright, Pink Floyd 
released their debut album, 
"The Piper at the Gates of 
Dawn." The following years 
saw the release of several psy-
chedelic records, as well as the 
loss of Barrett due to a severe 
mental breakdown, and the 

lease of "Dark Side of the 
Moon," one of the most suc-
cessful albums of all time. 

It was from this time on, 
that the band began to suffer 
severe internal strife. Nearly 
al\ the band's song writing was 
being done by Waters, and the 
remaining members grew more 
and more uneasy as their ar-
tistic inputs were colliding. 
The initial steps of disband-
ment were noticed as key-
boardist Wright was exiled 
from the band following the 
final production of "The 
Wal\ ." The tour and album 
that followed were filled with 
conflict and hate, and, after 
completion of "The Final 
Cut," Waters left the band, 
leaVing Pink Floyd with no 
direction and no definite 
future . 

Over the next few years, the 
bands' members al\ engaged in 
solo work, with only Waters 
achieving slightly significant 
success. In 1986, despite 
Waters' claim that Pink Floyd 
would never produce another 
album, Gilmour decided to 
reform the band with the aid

Stamey's 

all 
right 

by jeffrey kleen 
hiatus Itaff writer 

After leaving the critlcall y 
acclaimed band, the dB's, gui-
tarist Chris Stamey has re -
cently completed his second 
solo album, ''It's Alright." Un-
fortunately for Stamey, the 
new album is appropriately 
named . 

"It's Alright" is simply an 
uninspired collection of pop 
tunes. While some songs are 
enjoyable - particularly the 

first cut on the album, "Cara 
Lee," and "If You Hear My 
Voice" - most of the others 
art' done in the tired pop for-
mat. The biggest problem is 
Stamey's weak vocals. Awk -
ward and strained at times, his 
voice is neither unique nor 
passionate. . 

At a time of raised social 
and political consciousness in 
rock music, Stamey seems un-
touched by these concerns. It 
seems that, at least musically , 
Stamey's interests go nowhere 
beyond his latest girlfriend. 
His lyrics are stale and boring: 
"Bue it's alright, It's alright/It's 
alrighe, It's alright/"you can do as 
you like, it's alright/It'S alright." 

While Stamey fails as a lyri-
cist, he succeeds, to a small

along with 

extent, as a songwriter. His 
music hasa complicated, many 
textured style which would be 
enjoyable if unaccompanied 
by Stamey's near monotone 
vocals . In particular, "Cara 
Lee" and the soft ballad, "27 
Years In A Day," have excel-
It:nt arrangements and catchy 
melodies . Stamey sticks with a 
simple line-up of instruments 
and avoids what he calls, "high 
tech computer games." He re-
ceives some guitar playing help 
from the Box Tops' Alex Chil-
ton and back-up vocals from 
Marshall Crenshaw. 

But, on this album, Stamey 
needed more help than he 
received - maybe a stronger 
voice and some lyrical help

music In review 

from Bruce Springsteen . "It's 
Alright" just doesn't have the 
integrity or fire of Stamey's 
earlier works as a member of 
the influential, New York 
based dB's. "It's Alright" fol-
lows his first solo album in '83 
ca lled, " It's A Wonderful 
Life," which was recorded with 

Mitch Easter. 
The music, lyrics, and Sta-

mey's vocals in "It's Alright" 
lack passion. This album fails 
to challenge the listener, and, 
instead of pushing to the lim-
its of rock music, falls weakly 
into the Top 40 stack of trite 
and boring albums.

Floyd 
Continued from page 4 

of drummer Mason. Waters, 
who had no intention of re-
joining the band, threatened 
to bring legal action if Gil-
mour insisted on using the 
name, Pink Floyd. Though 
Waters did follow through 
with his threat, the courts have 
not as yet sided with him. 
Under the name Pink Floyd, 
"Momentary Lapse of 
Reason" is co-produced by 
Bob Ezrin, who also co-pro-
duced "The Wall." Ezrin, who 

also plays keyboards on the 
album, together with Gilmour, 
have remained true to the Pink 
Floyd sound, without the aid 
of Waters. As a whole, !'Mo-
mentary Lapse of Reason" is 
very comparable to such Pink 
Floyd classics as, "Wish You 
Were Here," "Dark Side of 
the Moon," and "Meddle," 
highlighting Gilmour's tre-
mendous guitar skills and haun-
ting sound effects common in 
all Pink Floyd albums. 

Recorded aboard Gilmour's 
houseboat! studio, Gilmour 
claims to have blended the 
feeling of the river into. the 
album. This is evident in the 
album's opening, "Signs of 

Life," in which the spooky 
sound of a man in a lifeboat 
searching (or land (or perhaps 
something deeper), echoes 
with a distinct s\:nse of reality. 
This is followed by the cur-
rent single, "Learning to Fly," 
which sets the tone of the 
entire album, spotlighting Gil-
mour's moody guitar riffs , and 
Mason's flowing drum beats. 
The following tune, "Dogs of 
War," is the album's most 
depressing song. Fashioned 
after Floyd anthems like 
"Money" and "In the Flesh," 
"Dogs of War" pounds out a 
dark and forceful attack at the 
invisible roots of violence. 

No doubt the best and most 
powerful song on the album is 
Gilmour's eerie glance at ro-
mance, "One Slip." "One 
Slip" proves that David Gil-
mour has the ability to pro-
duce true Floyd material, "One 
slip, and down the hole we fal-
l/lt seems to cake no time at 
alll A momentary lapse of rea-
son / That binds a life for life/ A 
small regret, )'014 won't forgel/-
There'll be no sleep in here to-
night." The second side of the 
album, primarily instrumental, 
is highlighted by the a cap-
pella, voice-synthesized moan 
of Gilmour in, "A New Ma-
chine {part I & II)." Finally, 
the album is rounded off with 
the soothing melody, 
"Sorrow," which brilliantly 
draws "Momentary Lapse of 
Reason" to a close. 

Aiding Gilmour, Mason and 
Ezrin, are over a dozen back-

ing musicians including fo rmer 
Floyd member, Richard 
Wright, and noted session 
player Tony Levin replacing 
Waters on bass. Gilmour 
admits that he used the ad-
ditional musicians to ensure a 
complete and solid sound that 
he could not have done alone. 

Probably the biggest ques-
tion following the release of 
"Momenta ry Lapse of 
Reason," is whether or not 
the band will tour . The band 
members do plan to playa sig-
nificantly larger amount of 
dates than the brief yet spec-
tacular "Wall" tour . The 
shows promise to be action-
packed, complete with flying 
animals, lasers, and renditions 
of most of the Pink Floyd 
classics. 

While the original pink 
Floyd will never again work 
together, at least the remain-
ing members have not given 
up. Though it may not live up 
to the expectations following 
their phenomenal early suc-
cess, "Momentary Lapse of 
Reason" is a good effort and 
should be deemed worthy of 
the Pink Floyd name.

withdrawn manner . While 
Lilly is played very well by 
Gail West, her eccentric and 
complex character is never 
fully revealed to the audience. 
Instead, she acts as a catalyst 
for the other characters to 
reflect upon their past and 
their present. 

Ail performances were excel-
lent, and the play successfully 
examines the changes mid-life 
is bound to bring about. 

"The Last Good Moment 
of Lilly Baker" will be playing 
at the Gaslamp Quarter 
Theatre through December 19. 
The theater is located on 444 
Fourth Avenue in the Gaslamp 
Quarter, a really interesting 
part of downtown because of 
its blend of old and artsy 
flavors . 

The theater itself is also an 
excellent facility because of its 
small size and intimate atmos-
phere . Although tickets may 
be a little more than what you 
expect for a weekend excur-
sion, the trip is well worth it.

be an honest effort," stated 
Julie Gardner, who runs 
"2581. " 

Gardner recently renovated 
an old bar at this address as an 
alternative to OJ -oriented 
dance clubs, or lubs that do 
not ad mit people under 21. 
She feels that most under-2 1 
e tabli hments are "too po-
liced" to be enjoyable and that 
San Diego needs more original 
showcases. 

Since "2581" does not serve 
alcohol, the club is not vice-
regulated; the present plan is 
to keep it open all night. Peo-
ple can come here after other 
concerts or parties "to have 
coffee and hang out with their 

friend ," Gardner said . 
Gardner envisions "2581" 

as a reflection of what people 
want to experien e when they 
go o~t - not an imposition of 
Top 40 values. "What i 
trendy? When everybody says 
the ame things and dresses 
the same way because they 
think they should. They like 
the same bands - not just 
because the bands are good-
but because someone told 
them so." 

Not so at "2581." Appear-
ing tomorrow night (Nov. 6) 
will be local bands Night Soil
