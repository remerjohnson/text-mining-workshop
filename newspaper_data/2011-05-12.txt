THE WAIT IS            .
YOUR GUIDE TO THE BEST DAY OF THE YEAR. PAGE 7

This Friday’s Sun God festival will take place on RIMAC field, where musical acts including Wiz Khalifa, Mike Posner and Crystal Castles will grace the main stage.
The event will include a lounge for students to relax, games, come-

dians and of course, music performances. This year’s biggest change is the 
lounge, a collaboration with beverage retailer D’lush. The lounge will serve 

mixed drinks — including an official Sun God drink — and provide couches 
and television screens for a live feed of the midway stage and dance tent.

“The planning for Sun God begins a year in advance and involves students and 
the campus community,” University Events Director Martin Wollesen said in an 

email. “This annual event impacts the entire campus, and there have been months of 
meetings with camps partners in the planning and preparation of Sun God.”

Each May, right after the festival, the University Events office — responsible for 
managing the festival and advising A.S. Concerts and Events — does a debriefing with 
colleges, health and safety personnel, police and security personnel, technical crew, 

venue staff and others.
Feedback from these meetings is used in the planning of the next year’s festival, 

which begins in Fall Quarter when the ASCE staff first meets, and continues 
through Spring Quarter.

“We’ve also hosted open fora with students, and certainly A.S. leader-
ship,” Wollesen said. “Those notes are then used for the planning pro-
cess. The summer is largely dependent on the availability of ASCE 

staff. If they are around or we can connect remotely, meetings/
planning can happen in the summer. That varies from year to

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Scripps Robotic Landers Used for Deep-Sea Exploration
By Natalie Covate
Staff Writer

Virgin Oceanic — a company 
that uses deep-sea submarines to 
explore the trenches of the ocean — 
is working with Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, which will provide 
robotic landers and marine biology 
expertise in a race to deepest part of 
the ocean.

These devices are encased in high 
pressure-resistant glass balls that allow 
submarines to retrieve water and 

sediment samples, as well as provide 
incubation for microbes, crustacean 
and worm samples from the deepest 
parts of the ocean for scientists to 
study. 

The landers are dropped into water 
from boats and fall to the bottom of the 
ocean, where they employ lights and 
cameras to illuminate the ocean floor 
for footage.

Scripps has used landers like this 
in the past to gather samples from 
hostile ocean environments, such as 
the Arctic Ocean and other similar 
ocean trenches.

SIO Marine Microbial Genetics 
Professor Doug Bartlett is one of the 
scientists working with Virgin Oceanic 
to study the life found in the deep.

“The appreciation that so much 
of life is found in the microbes of this 
planet, and [that] so many microbes are 
found in the deep ocean environments 
help drive [exploration of the deep],” 
he said.

Virgin Oceanic said on its website 
that these samples cannot only be 
used to map out the ecology of the 
ocean, but may provide information 

for biotechnology and medicine. 
According to Bartlett, the scientific 

community still has many questions 
about microbes that exist in deep 
ocean environments.

“There are huge numbers of 
microbes down deep, so we wonder 
about what they do,” he said.

Much of the carbon dioxide fixation 
key to the environment is presumed 
to be present in the deep ocean. 
Researchers also aim to identify the 
kinds of degradative enzymes in the 
various organisms found, and whether 
certain microbes may have useful 
properties in developing antibiotics.

“I do think, if we find organisms, 
if we are able to culture new major 
branches of life, we will want to put 
a great deal of effort into biology of 
understanding these new organisms,” 
Bartlett said.

Virgin Oceanic’s submarine design, 
which incorporates elements of the 
company’s other projects, such as a 
small jet, will hold one person. The 
design flies to the bottom of the ocean 
and, if not flying, will head toward the 
surface.

The company’s plan is to make 
five dives over about three years in the 
deepest areas of the ocean. The first 
will take place in the Challenger Deep 
— part of the Marianna Trench located 
south of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. 
The area is known as the deepest point 
in the ocean, reaching a known depth 
of 6.78 miles. 

According to the Virgin Oceanic 
website, the company hopes to make 
this dive in the Challenger Deep later

NEWS THURSDAY, MAY 12, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

By Nicole Chan
Staff Writer

Effective July 1, UCSB will administer the University of 
California Education Abroad Program at each of the 10 UC 
campuses.

UC President Mark Yudof, UCSB Chancellor Henry 
Yang and UCEAP Executive Director Jean-Xavier Guinard 
signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Wednesday 
May 4 to officially document the transition of administrative 
oversight of the program from the UC headquarters to the 
Santa Barbara campus.

“The transition is looking for efficiency because of its 
geographic location and to create administrative efficiency,” 
Senior Analyst of EAP Andrea Delap said.

According to Delap, students won’t likely see any changes 
to the program, as the partnership is essentially a transfer of 
administrative duties.

“The hope is that the partnership will create 
administrative efficiencies in the future by saving costs,” 
Delap said. 

The transition is intended to decrease the program’s 
operating costs. Delap added that no additional staff 
members would be required to administer the program at 
UCSB.

“We’re really excited to be housed on the Santa Barbara 
campus and about the new administrative partnership,” 
Delap said.

According to Delap, 4,834 UC students participated in 
EAP during the current academic year.

The decision to move administrative control to UCSB 
was achieved in the interest of making the program more 
accessible to students, EAP Executive Director Jean-Xavier 
Guinard said in an interview with the official UCSB 
student newspaper, the Daily Nexus, in a May 6 article 

entitled   “UCEAP Passes Baton to UCSB, Campus to 
Assume Leadership.”

According to Delap, UCOP talked to senior 
administrators at all of the UC campuses about hosting the 
program, and UCSB expressed interest.

“UCSB is considered to be a leader in EAP based on our 
recruiting, fundraising and advertising,” UCSB EAP campus 
director Juan Campos said to the Daily Nexus. 

Additionally, UCSB faculty members will work as 
program advisers under the new partnership.

According to Delap, the decision to move administrative 
oversight to UCSB has been in the works for a while. UCOP 
conferred with administrators across the UC system about 
how to best serve an academic program like the EAP.

“Academic instructional programs like UCEAP are 
better served at a campus than they are at the university’s 
administrative headquarters — UCOP,” UCOP Vice Provost 
Daniel Greenstein said in a statement.

According to Delap, the program originated at UCSB 
fifty years ago under UC President Clark Kerr, and was 
based there for three decades before changing oversight 
responsibilities to UCOP in Oakland. According to Delap, 
the UCOP administered the EAP for about two decades 
prior to the recent partnership. 

According to the Daily Nexus, the UCEAP office is 
currently located near the campus. The EAP office will 
continue to report to Yudof, as well as to UCSB.

UCSB hopes to benefit from the transition, explained 
Delap. Currently, UCSB students work as interns in the EAP 
office in areas of social media and communications. 

“It is our hope that under the new partnership, we will be 
able to grow the internship to benefit both the EAP and the 
students of UCSB,” Delap said.

Last night was the first meeting with next year’s council. President Alyssa 
Wing started out sweet by bringing 
Sprinkles cupcakes for all 35 
councilmembers. 
Holy expensive ...

The most 
exciting event 
of the night was 
the hour spent 
deciding on a 
new speaker. 
Unfortunately, 
that entire was closed to the public; 
we were, frustratingly, not even 
allowed to hear the announcement 
that outgoing Muir College Senator 
Ryan O’Rear won the position. 
Outgoing Sixth College Senator 
Parminder Sandhu, outgoing 
Associate Vice President of College 
Affairs Leonard Bobbitt and 
Warren College President-elect 
Kristina Pham were his opponents, 
but Pham unexpectedly dropped 
out at the last moment. 

Student Sustainability Public 
Health Director Elizabeth Elman, 
Intersectionality Assistant Directors 
Andrew Busalt and Jillian Du 
and Energy and Waste Director 
Annie Le gave an overview of what 
they’ve done for this year, such as 
implementing the fair trade policy 
across campus, and also their 
progress on banning plastic water 
bottles in dining halls and Price 
Center vendors. 

Bobbitt said that Revelle 
College’s cake party for having the 
largest voter turnout at this year’s 
A.S. elections campaign will be May 
18 in front of CLICS at 2 p.m. “Get 
on top of it,” Bobbitt said.

Vice President of External 
Affairs Samer Naji announced 
that the D.R.E.A.M. Act postcard 
campaign was successful in 

bringing over 11,000 postcards from 
campuses statewide to Congress.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise and Operations Brian 
McEuen said Triton Outfitters 

has launched its 
causes line, which 
allows proceeds 
from t-shirt sales 
to go to causes 
such as Red Cross 
and the Sierra 
Club. He also said 
that two special 

items will be sold during the Sun 
God festival — one of which is an 
exclusive Triton Outfitters beach 
towel, and the other remains a 
secret.

Associate Vice President of Local 
Affairs Matthew Vu announced the 
grand opening of the Inter-Tribal 
Resource Center May 16. The 
resource center will be adjacent to 
S.P.A.C.E.S. in Price Center East. 

Associate Vice President of 
Student Organizations Carli 
Thomas asked councilmembers to 
spread the word about the Student 
Foundation’s Senior Class Gift, 
which has asked graduating seniors 
to each donate $20 for scholarships. 
Their goal is to raise $30,000 for 
scholarships.

Associate Vice President of 
Athletic Relations Pauline Nuth 
announced that the baseball team 
is number one in our conference — 
though they’re missing the Sun God 
Festival for post-season playoffs. 
They’re also going to regionals. Go 
Tritons! 

Interim Associate Vice President 
of Student Advocacy Arohi Sharma 
was the last speaker of the evening. 
She asked all of council to give 
the previous speaker, Meredith 
Madnick, a large round of applause 
— and that Madnick received.

I love winning. Even more than that, I love winning free shit. But I also hate wasting time, 
and it’s for this reason that I never 
enter contests hosted by massive, 
multinational corporations like 
Coca Cola, who hold essay contests 
on dramatic, sweeping topics like, 
“What speaks for your generation?” 
(Wrong answers: Ke$ha, Rebecca 
Black, PepsiCo.)

I’ve learned the hard way that 
any and all time spent on such con-
tests will result in an entry being 
lost to cyberspace. The six hours 
you spent drafting the perfect 
answer (Lady Gaga speaks for my 
generation, Coca Cola!) will be for 
naught, as you end up sending it to 
the wrong email address.  

I have also learned that video 
contests are similarly discouraging. 
It doesn’t matter if you shoot your 
Internet Explorer promo video with 
a Canon 60D and a $3,000 lens 
kit — your submission will, invari-
ably, be sucker-punched by another 
scary-cat-lady video. 

So, if you’re really in the mood 
to win, enter small, local competi-
tions. One of my greatest triumphs 
in life was winning a Facebook 
contest for one of the best, locally-
based chocolate companies in the 
Bay Area: Recchiuiti Chocolates. 
The mere fact that they’re based 
in San Francisco’s Ferry Building 
is testament to their utter unaf-
fordability. (That, and the $44 you 
pay for a box of 16 truffles. It’s that 
good.)

Once upon a boring sum-
mer at home, Recchiuti posted a 
Facebook game in which the first 
fan to answer a question about the 
company would win a prize. I was 
game. I was ready. I was in a manic, 
oddly focused state. I answered 
their question about the founder 
of the company in less than 15 
seconds. It was apparently all so 
strange and hilarious that they felt 
the need  to comment on my speed 
three times on their Facebook page 
and once in person. 

But that doesn’t matter: I had 
won two tickets to their ice cream 
social — a $60 value! My mother, 
another huge fan, took the second 
ticket, and we spent the better 
part of the day gorging ourselves 
with salted caramel ice cream and 
freshly-made chocolate ice cream 
bon bons. All the other suckers 
there had spent upwards of $80 on 
their families, kids included (most 
of whom probably couldn’t even 
tell the difference between Dreyers 
and Haagen Dazs. I know I couldn’t 
when I was younger). 

Moral of the story is: keep an 
eye out for the smaller, local com-
petitions and you’ve got a decent 
shot. They’re usually advertised on 
the company’s Facebook fan page 
or Twitter, and can vary from just 
being the 20,000 fan to answering a 
couple of questions first. 

The loot might seem sort of 
insignificant compared to that of 
those big competitions that you’ve 
shirked, but when you’re in it for 
the thrill of the win, the victory’s all 
the prize you need. 

You Can’t 
Win ’em All, 
But You Can

Current plans for Greek housing don’t just come with a 
hefty pricetag — they also carry a host of on-campus 

restrictions that defeat its purpose altogether.

Tonight, the 2011-12 A.S. Council settles into its first meeting, meaning that it’s been officially 
a year since last year’s crop hiked up to 
the Forum buoyed by goals of increas-
ing parking, starting a football team 
and having more nooners — all prom-
ises that haven’t panned out. 

Given this environment, it’s all 
the more admirable that, throughout 
failed referenda after failed referenda 
and another controversial divestment 
resolution, former Campuswide Senator 
Michael Raimondi has held so strongly 
to the Greek housing plan he conceived 
as an Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more. He’s chaired meetings throughout 

the year, met with the Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality Department and, on 
his way out, has announced a timeline: 
plans finished by June 2012 and build-
ing to begin in 2017 — a lot sooner 
than most imagined for a project this 
large. 

But while Raimondi’s tenacity is a 
trait councilmembers could use more 
of, the plan to build the housing at the 
on-campus East Regents lot may bring 
unwanted complications that will put a 
damper to the popularity of his plans. 

Raimondi and the Greek Housing 
Initiative Committee’s Panhellenic Vice 
Chair Jillian Wolter said they chose 
the on-campus location because its 

proximity to the soon-to-be-operating 
light rail will make it easier for groups 
to coordinate events closer to campus. 
Location and proximity are important 
considerations, given carless under-
classmen who may want to live at the 
row; but ultimately, this proposed 
plan comes with too many other bur-
dens born from its on-campus status. 
Exorbitant parking prices and near 
nonexistent parking, expensive startup 
costs and an overpriced dining plan are 
just a few of the drawbacks an on-cam-
pus Greek row would carry with it. 

The project would also be subject

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
As a student of Eleanor Roosevelt 

College — a college that stands on the 
ideals of international consciousness, 
human rights advocacy and cultural 
awareness — I believe events such 
as Justice in Palestine Week here at 
UCSD are both a necessity and an 
obligation for students on campus. 
This year’s theme, Justice in Palestine: 
Time for Accountability draws from 
the notion that we as students, as 
American citizens and as human 
beings, are connected to the world 
around us. The conflict between 
Israel and Palestine is no exception. 
Whether we study chemistry, ethnic 
studies or theatre, we are part of a 
larger community, we are a part of 
this country and we are a part of 

this institution. We must hold our 
society and ourselves accountable for 
a connection to this violent conflict, 
for silence is indeed complicity.

The purpose of Justice in Palestine 
Week, from my perspective, is two-
fold. It aims to not simply bring an 
untold narrative to UCSD; it also 
aims to challenge our privilege. It is 
our privilege as American citizens to 
ignore these injustices. It is our privi-
lege as American citizens to never feel 
or endure the decades of occupation 
that we contribute to yearly with our 
tax dollars. It is our privilege to label 
those non-violently resisting the occu-
pation as “terrorists”. It is our privilege 
to defend the asymmetry of this 
conflict: the rights of the nation-state 
before the indigenous people. It is our 
privilege to remain silent, because 
who will truly hold us accountable 
for our contribution to the systematic 
erasure of an entire ethnic population?

The mock wall built in the middle 
of campus, the speak-outs, the spoken 
word and the discussion panels may 
seem intrusive and overwhelming. 
Many claim that it targets those who 
sympathize with the state of Israel or 
who are Israeli. On that point I would 
simply like to say that in all my years 
as a student at UCSD, I have never 
been taught that criticizing a govern-
ment and the practices of its military 
imply an attack on its citizenry. In 
presenting this information, these 
students break the silence on this con-
flict — they challenge our privilege — 
and make us all accountable to these 
crimes. We are accountable: with our 
tax dollars, with our affiliation with 
this university that is invested in the 
Israeli military and with our silence. 

I believe UCSD and ERC have 
taught me to care about the world 
around me, to stand for any struggle 
for rights and equality, and to care 

about how I, as a human being, could 
be connected to the oppression of 
other human beings, wherever they 
may be. So I know I will take this 
week to engage myself, ask difficult 
questions, listen and learn. I urge you 
to also challenge yourself, to push 
the boundaries of your preconceived 
notions and to open your heart and 
mind to this untold story.

oPINIoN THURSDAY, MAY 12, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

For Greek Housing, Just Stick With Off-Campus Houses
to on-campus alcohol policies — 
meaning potential residents would 
be paying ever-growing rent to 
party in fear 
when they could 
find a cheaper, 
non-RSO con-
trolled house in 
University City. 
Of course, the 
housing may be 
attractive option 
for underclass-
men who choose 
to live on campus and bear the bur-
dens anyway, but the timing of rush 
and finality of housing contracts 
means that most freshmen will miss 
out on this opportunity. 

The projected $60 million 
necessary to create living quarters 
for Greeks is not worth the slew 
of problems that come with it. A 

Greek row that 
is subject to the 
campus alcohol 
policies and hous-
ing costs is hardly 
different from 
Greeks choosing 
to live together in 
the dorms (albeit 
on a grander 
scale). 

Raimondi, Wolter and the rest 
of the Greek Housing Initiative 
Committee have already done a 
good job by taking the project this 
far and, wisely, working to ensure 

that the project’s funded by HDH, 
and not student fees. But they need 
to survey their potential residents 
more seriously, work at extensive 
outreach and receive definite agree-
ments before proposing another 
structure on campus. Raimondi says 
that they’ve received confirmation 
from about 800 students expressing 
interest, but none of these will be 
around when the structure debuts; 
not to mention that, with on-cam-
pus rent sure to rise by then, that 
number may dwindle. 

The committee should be com-
mended for the research they’ve 
done thus far, but without concrete 
projections of student interest, it’s 
best to go big with off-campus liv-
ing, or go home. 

a Greek row that is 
subject to campus 
alcohol policies is hardly 
different from Greeks 
choosing to live together 
in the dorms.

year.”
According to Wollesen, festival planning is 

complex and detailed. ASCE and the University 
Events Office must prioritize safety while still 
making the festival enjoyable for students.

“Our primary concerns of course are the 
health and safety of our students,” Wollesen 
said. “At the same time, everyone is commit-
ted to providing a robust community-building 
event that is uniquely UC San Diego.”

Campaigns and programs such as “Sun God 
Says” — which works to promote safety on the 
day of the festival — have been implemented to 
promote responsible festival behavior.

“The Sun God Says campaign is a health and 
wellness campaign that goes on all through-
out the year,” Lupe Samaniego-Kraus, Student 
Health Services Center Health Educator, said. 
“We know that students make choices when 
they drink or not drink. We just want them to be 
as well-informed as possible so if they do decide 
to drink, they do it in a low risk way, minimizing 
negative consequences.”

This year, Student Health Services partnered 
with Recording Artists against Drunk Driving 
— a designated driver program to give students  
safe transportation to campus on the day of the 
festival. When picking up festival wristbands, 
students will receive a RADD card and a “Sun 
God Says: Don’t Miss the Music” card to remind 
students not drink to the point of unconscious-
ness.

ASCE and the University Events Office 
plan all aspects of the festival, including ticket-
ing, merchandising, artistic planning, security, 
lights, sound, staging, venue preparation, ven-
dor selection and support.

The budget for the festival is roughly 
$530,000 drawn from student fees. ASCE spent 
about $690,000 on the festival last year, allocat-

ing $50,000 to security and about $190,000 on 
the artists. ASCE plans to spend a similar sum 
this year.

Wollesen said this year’s festival boasts 
improved communication through the event’s 
website, the addition of more sponsors, oppor-
tunities to meet the artists and improved layout, 
games, and midway performances.

There is also an effort to reduce the festival’s 
carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. 
In the interest of discouraging waste, students 
who bring their own reusable bottles will be 
provided free cold water.

Those without bottles will have to pur-
chase recyclable cornstarch cups for $1, and 
Styrofoam cups will be banned. The festival 
aims to reduce carbon emissions by collaborat-
ing with CarbonGuard — a San Diego-based 
environmental organization — to calculate the 
festival’s carbon footprint and use this informa-
tion to fund carbon emission reduction projects 
on campus that will offset the carbon emission 
from the festival.

“Every year, ASCE students and campus 
partners learn from and improve on previous 
festivals,” Wollesen said. “We have a constant 
focus on supporting the safety and well being of 
our students, as well as creating a more engag-
ing community experience that reflects UC San 
Diego at its most creative and innovative. Sun 
God, like UCSD, is constantly evolving.”

Zhang expects that the event will reach 
RIMAC field’s capacity of 20,000 people.

“There were some bumpy roads along the 
way, but in the end, I think we’re really pleased 
with the finished product and what the lineup 
is. We’re pleased with how smooth things are 
going, especially right now,” Zhang said.

There are two additional competitors in the 

race to the bottom: Triton Submarine and movie 
director James Cameron who, according to online 
magazine ExtremeTech, hopes to use the 3-D 
footage for the next “Avatar” movie.

“We are very excited about the scientific parts

A
nd they say all I rap about is 
bitches and champagne,” says 
Wiz Khalifa on the first track, 
“When I’m Gone,” off his recently 

released album Rolling Papers. He continues in 
his charming, half-smirking flow, “You would 
too if every night you seen the same thing.”

It’s as if this man was made for Sun God. 
Wiz — born Cameron Jibril Thomaz — is 

not shy about his affinity for booze, women 
and, most importantly, marijuana (his mix 
tape titles, Kush and Orange Juice and Burn 
After Rolling, can attest to that). With his spot 
headlining the main stage, the rapper is sure 
to be the perfect ringleader for the fucked-up 
masses. 

Since his ode to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
“Black and Yellow,” blew up last football sea-
son, Wiz has taken his place as this year’s 
reigning prince of hip hop (so long, Drake). 
But the track — even with its stupidly repeti-
tive chorus and proud declarations of “doing 
it big” — doesn’t really owe its triumphant 
aura to Wiz’s hometown football team; “Black 
and Yellow” is the sound of a breakthrough. 
When he spouts about how he has “just made 
a million, got another million on my sched-
ule,” Wiz is right. He’s securing his spot in the 
mainstream, and leaving behind his long, mix 
tape-ridden path to the top. 

He’s also living it up. For one, the 23-year-
old can actually afford the diamonds he once 
bragged about.

But the dude’s always been a fan of excess 
(“I’m addicted to champagne,” he admits on 
“The Thrill,” amongst mumbled declarations 
of how stoned he is), but now he’s got the swag 

to back it up. He’s copped Kanye’s main-gal 
Amber Rose, been arrested for marijuana pos-
session and inspired countless sports-team 
remixes (including one by Lil Wayne) for his 
Steelers ditty. 

For those who only know “Black and 
Yellow,” though (and let’s be real — that’s most 
of you), there’s a lot more to enjoy from Wiz’s 
main stage set — especially if you’re buzzin’ 
off some cheap champagne and smoking a 
blunt.  

While his latest album has plenty of duds 
(the Bruno Mars-style girlfriend ode “Roll 
Up”), his earlier work is wake-and-bake chill. 
Literally. The relaxed “Mezmorized” on Kush 
and Orange Juice recalls Snoop Dogg in his 
heyday; he isn’t rattling off lines to show off 
— his chatty flow often succumbs to chuckles, 
like your jokester friend telling a story before 
he passes the bowl.  

He isn’t just a hip-hop guy, either. Khalifa 
frequently borrows from indie-rock and elec-
tronica for his samples, making many of his 
tracks as danceable as anything on the radio. 
Wiz’s 2008 hit “Say Yeah” takes from Alice 
Deejay’s eurodance “Better Off Alone,” while 
“The Thrill” remixes Empire of the Sun’s 
“Walking On a Dream.”

So with your buzz at its eleventh hour, 
Wiz Khalifa, ever the energetic stoner, will 
be giving you plenty to enjoy: He’s got the 
ganja-infused drive — flitting from Cudi-style 
introspection to fuck-it, bro enthusiasm — to 
make this Sun God one you might actually try 
to remember.

World

J unior high marked a golden age in the lives of us American suburbanites. Braces off, we flirted with disaster — blazing new trails from the deck of a Razor scooter while humming 
a riff from some ultra-serious “alternative rock” band fea-

tured on the homepage of the iTunes music store.  
Chances are, one of those bands was Jimmy Eat World — 

Arizona’s own ceaselessly lovelorn, alt-pop powerhouse. 
Glistening radio singles like “The Middle” and “Pain” — driven 

by frontman Jim Adkins’ bittersweet belting — pinpointed that 
distinct combination of angst, uncertainty and unshakable long-
ing that colors early adolescence. And as we’ve grown older, Jimmy 
Eat World’s teary-eyed anthems have formed a hand-me-down 
soundtrack for an new generation of restless American tweens.

“I think that’s cool,” drummer/co-founder Zach Lind said in 
an interview with the Guardian. “We never really try to target any 
specific demographic. We just do what’s intuitive and try to sound 
like who we are, instead of, like, ‘Oh, we want to make a record that 
sounds like the Strokes. Let’s do that.’ I think that’s what gives us the 
ability to attract such different age groups.”

The band’s range has lent itself to enviable success. While the 
Taking Back Sundays and Get Up Kids of yesteryear have slowly 
faded from Top-40 relevance, Jimmy Eat World arrive at this year’s 
Sun God on the heels of their seventh studio album, the critically-
acclaimed Invented. 

“This time around, we really focused on relying on our own intu-
ition as a band,” Lind said. “We struggled finding the right person 
to produce Invented, and then we had the idea to work with [Clarity 
and Bleed American producer] Mark Trombino. It worked out really 
well.”

Thousands of sweaty, sun-baked festivalgoers might agree. 

INTERVIEW

Crystal Castles

T
hough RIMAC field’s bound to witness more than its fair 
share of chaos this Friday, the crowning moment will 
doubtless be a sunset performance by manic Toronto 
synth-poppers Crystal Castles. With a style that blends 

lo-fi video game glitches with thundering drums and an extra layer 
of otherworldly noise, the duo — consisting of Canadians Alice 
Glass and Ethan Kath — is sure to have the strangest, most crowd-
dividing set of the festival.

The group rose to fame with a slew of stirring singles like 
“Alice Practice” (which was reportedly released on accident) and 
“Crimewave,” both of which combine the Castles’ neo-goth aesthetic 
with relentlessly enjoyable grooves. They’ve followed these singles 
with two critically hyped self-titled albums, on which the duo per-
fected their dark, aggressive approach to dance music.

What’s more, as anyone who went to Coachella last month can 
attest, the band’s live set is even wilder than their records. Glass, the 
duo’s unhinged singer, flails herself with abandon toward everything 
from the speakers to the drum set that the band’s recently added 
to their live setup. But there’s a method to the coked-up madness. 
Crystal Castles put on an awesome show — one that’s sure to be one 
of the most unforgettable of the festival.

Kill the noise
T

his one’s for all you T-shirt-whirling techno bros 
in the crowd. Kill the Noise’s latest LP Kill Kill 
Kill finds the LA DJ offering us the body-vibing 
synths, the machine gun drum patterns and, of 

course, the dubstep that we’ve come to expect of any decent 
booze-soaked dance tent.

After years of rummaging dusty bins of vinyl and play-
ing sold-out LA nightclubs, Kill the Noise’s Jacob “Ewun” 
Stanczak caught critical attention in 2001 with the release 
of his Roots EP. Since then, he’s channeled the techno gods 
at some of the country’s most legendary festivals, including 
HARD, Electric Daisy Carnival and Audiotistic.

With banshee sirens and the omnipresent wobwobwob of 
dubstep, Stanczak rakes in the dance-floor hype with little 
more than an abrasive, metronomic groove and a little well-
placed vocal sampling. On crowd favorite “My World,” the 
lyrics “It’s like” punctuate a repetitive beat with just a few 
minor tweaks and variations in drum patterns along the way.  

A Kill the Noise live performance looks to be as follows: 
Stanczak presses the occasional button on his suspiciously 
elaborate setup, shakes violently on stage as the crowd gets 
riled up and ends by giving an emotional thank you to his 
fans, saying he’d be nothing without us (putting his left hand 
to heart and pointing to the crowd with his right).  

For the Sun God Festival’s gleefully inebriated masses, 
who could ask for more?

Ocelot
D

ance newcomers Ocelot take their name from an 
adorable South American wildcat that’d rip your 
face off if given the chance. It’s that dichotomy 
between the irresistible and the catastrophic that 

makes this trans-Atlantic duo’s music so interesting. Cory 
Kilduff and Jimmy Welsh began making music in 2002 — 
Kilduff, the lead singer in a hardcore metal band, and Welsh, 
a BMX enthusiast with a penchant for ‘60s rock and modern 
pop. The eclectic influences resulted in a sort of dance music 
grab bag, with everyone from Quincy Jones to Cher slipping 
through the cracks of some seriously loud, heavy-hitting 
riffs. Singles like “Our Time” and “Beating Hearts” shake the 
walls with quivering force, yet remain invariably devoted to 
a glimmering pop sensibility that’d  melt the hearts of even 
the dourest of clubgoers.

iven the epic nature of past dance stage head-
liners, it’s clear Jesse F. Keeler (alias JFK) of 
Canadian electronic duo MSTRKRFT has some 
high expectations to live up to. But fear not — 

dance-inclined Sun God veterans flush with fond memories 
of Girl Talk’s frenetic mash-ups and Z-Trip’s masterful 
(albeit shortened) set won’t be disappointed by JFK’s equally 
explosive brand of electronic music. 

A departure from the past two years’ mash-up headlin-
ers, JFK’s known for an eclectic mix of house, techno and 
dance-rock that calls to mind Daft Punk and the Bloody 
Beetroots. The influence of JFK’s mother project, dance-
punk legends Death From Above 1979, is evidenced by the 
searing power chords and synth spikes that fuel the numer-
ous remixes of rock classics that have rocketed MSTRKRFT 
to YouTube glory. 

While critical reception to MSTRKRFT’s albums has 
been lukewarm, their top-notch live shows suggest their 
pounding bass lines and scintillating beats are best enjoyed 
in person, assisted by adrenaline and the controlled sub-
stances of your choosing.   

While JFK’s solo focus tends toward conventional elec-
tro, his rollercoaster breakdowns will turn the northern half 
of RIMAC Field into a throbbing, sweaty mass — an easy 
out for those uninterested in the nostalgic emoness of aging 
rockers Jimmy Eat World.

la riots

S ince 2007, LA Riots have perfected their blend of dance-heavy, indie-electro beats and genre-defining commercial tracks. Working with a slew of big names ranging from Weezer to 
Kings of Leon to, most recently, Mother Monster her-
self, Lady Gaga, Daniel LeDisko and Jon Pegnato have 
become an industry favorite for major label remixes.  

LeDisko and Pegnato, who have been working on 
original tracks after playing with 12th Planet and the 
Crystal Method in Hawaii, took a few minutes to talk 
with the Guardian about video games, storm chasing 
and what to expect from their dance tent set at this year’s 
festival. 
Guardian: You guys have a lot of other DJs who live 
around you, don’t you?
Daniel LeDisko: Yeah, 12th Planet lives in the building 
over from me, and Dave Nata from Natastrom lived in 
my building.
Jon Pegnato: Skrillex was living downtown, but I don’t 
know what he’s doing now. I think he’s just on tour indefi-
nitely. 
DL: But yeah, there’s a lot of guys who live downtown, 
and we all just hang out all the time together.
JP: We just basically go over and eat at the other people’s 
houses. We have a lot of potlucks.
DL: I think we all spent Christmas Eve with each other, 
like Rusko and 12th. A bunch of us did.  
G: Do you know Shiny Toy Guns, the band from 
Hollywood?
DL: I’m actually really good friends with [Jeremy 
Dawson, bass/keyboards for Shiny Toy Guns].
G: So their song “Girls LeDisko” — are those your fan-
girls, Daniel?
DL: Yeah, Jeremy was the resident DJ at this club called 
LeDisko; Club 82 was what it was called back in the day 
before Shiny Toy Guns and all that stuff was big ... And 
then that club night stopped and then they brought it 
back two years later and I was the resident at it. And the 
night was called “LeDisko,” so everybody just called me 
Daniel LeDisko.
G: I’ve actually interviewed Jeremy. He’s a really nice guy.
DL: Yeah, he’s very nice. Did he tell you about his obses-
sion with tornados? I was playing a gig in Oklahoma City, 
which is where they’re from. I was on stage DJing and 
he tapped me on the back and I was like, “Whoa, what

Best Coast

L
ike so many Californians, Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino fled 
east after graduating high school. The Angeleno spent some 
time studying creative writing at the New School in New 
York, but grew homesick for the surf and the sun and in 2009 

departed Brooklyn for — you guessed it — the left coast. After recruit-
ing bandmates Bobb Bruno and Ali Koehler, formerly of Vivian Girls, 
the group found critical acclaim on the web as early as the end of 2009. 
The rest is shoegaze history. 

Cosentino’s homesickness manifests itself in her songwriting, which 
tends to circle back to a few choice themes: weed, boys, the beach and, 
on occasion, her pet cat, Snacks. You’d be forgiven for confusing any of 
the band’s lo-fi, up-tempo tracks; the group’s debut EP, “Crazy For You,” 
blends together in a half-hour-long garage pop haze.

The band’s sound draws heavily from ’60s surf rock, and with the 
grungy production values to match. That relaxedness should provide 
for a fitting mid-afternoon set; scheduled between main stage opening 
act Kera and the Lesbians and Mike Posner, Best Coast may not have 
the crowd-riling potential of Crystal Castles, but there’s no better bet 
for some inconspicuous pre-rage downtime in the crowd.

ike Posner knows what it’s like — he really 
does. The dude graduated from Duke 
University last year with a degree in soci-
ology and a 3.59 GPA. Plus, he pledged 

Kappa Sigma. So really, he’s one of us. 
Except that the twenty-two year old is also a Billboard 

Hot 100 recording artist, and instead of binge drinking in 
the middle of midterms, he’s playing the main stage. 

Last summer his singles “Cooler Than Me” and “Please 
Don’t Go” were our heat-wave earworms; the electro-pop 
bangers worked their way through nearly every radio sta-
tion playlist, whether we liked them or not.

But we’ll give him credit: the club-friendly hooks that 
litter his tracks are plenty of fun, though we still can’t help 
but relate to the chick he’s whining about in “Cooler Than 
Me” — Posner is anything but hip.

He’s like Justin Timberlake with a scratchier voice and 
a “Party with Pike” shirt, begging his woman not to leave 
him before he chugs a beer and fist pumps with his bros. 
And for some midday drunken sway, that sounds like it 
might not be so bad.

B
attle of the Bands winner Kera & the 
Lesbians may not have the best set-time of 
the festival — kicking off the main stage 
as their drunken peers trickle in — but if 

you’re an early riser, they are worth a listen before the 
real deal begins. 

The Escondido group, headed by Kera’s free-wheel-
ing vocals, play a refreshing blend of garage-rock and 
folk, turning mythical gypsy tales and Janis Joplin-
style ballads into straight up rock ‘n’ roll anthems. 

The Lesbians may not be the main act yet, but give 
the group a heaping of Internet buzz and they could 
be taking Best Coast’s spot any day now. 

For now, catch them before everyone else does — 
and party like it’s the 1970’s, complete with loud gui-
tars, angry chicks and plenty of beer.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 12, 2011 HIATUS

the songs have great raps, but there 
is such a thing as over-rapping on 
songs. I think a lot of people don’t 
understand — sometimes you can 
rap too much. It takes real artistry to 
make a song that perfectly 
relates to somebody, rath-
er than you showing off 
how good you can rap.”

But Big Sean under-
stands the importance of 
hustle, swag and good rap 
— it’s how he got signed 
to Kanye West’s GOOD 
music label a few years 
back.

“It’s a crazy story,” he 
said. “I used to go to this 
radio station soon as I 
was old enough to drive, 
and there was this show 
where emcees would bat-
tle and the winner would 
get to rap on air for 30 minutes over 
some instrumentals. So I did that for 
a few years and then Kanye was down 
promoting his album — it was Late 
Registration, this was a long time ago 
— and I was actually a telemarketer, 
so I was cashing my $100 check. And 
my homie called me while I was in 
the bank Saturday morning and was 
all, ‘Hey, you listening to the radio?’ 
and I was like ‘No man. What’s up?” 
and he was like ‘Kanye’s down there 
playing his album, if you go down 
there and rap for him, he’ll probably 
sign you, cuz.”

West wasn’t exactly keen on the 
idea.

“I asked if I could rap for him and 
he wasn’t really trying to hear it, he 
said he didn’t have time,” Sean said. 
“But then I was like ‘Please man, 
you’re like one of my heroes.’ And he 
was like, ‘Alright man, well you gotta 
do it while we walkin’ out the sta-
tion. You got 16 bars.’ And that’s the 
equivalent of like … one verse. And 
so I started rapping as we’re walk-
ing out of the station, and at first he 
wasn’t even paying attention, but then 

I guess I said a couple of lines that he 
really liked. And he just really liked 
it and I ended up rapping for like, 10 
minutes straight.”

From those 10 minutes, Big 
Sean launched his career.  It was a 
slow start — after two more years 
of exchanging music back and forth 
with West, Big Sean graduated from 

high school with a 
3.7 GPA and enrolled 
in Michigan State 
University, set on 
pursuing a degree 
in advertising. But 
after being signed 
to Kanye’s label, he 
dropped out.  

“It was like, the 
first day of class and I 
didn’t go,” he said.

Turning out tracks 
turned out to be a lot 
of work — especially 
when working under 
the wings of one of 

the industry’s top hip-hop artists.
“Just working with Kanye — it’s 

really nerve-wrecking working with 
him in the studio,” Big Sean said. 
“He’s really particular, so you don’t 
want to be like half-assin’ it.  It made 
me nervous to be around him, but as 
time went on, he became more and 
more my friend and mentor. And I 
used to play music and he’d be like, 
‘Man, it’s not good enough’ and now I 
play music and he’s like ‘Man, it’s the 
best. You gonna be one of the best.’”

And though fame’s been a long 
time coming, it seems to be happen-
ing all at once for Big Sean — in addi-
tion to dropping his album this sum-
mer, he’s going on tour to open for 
longtime friend and fellow Sun God 
Festival performer, Wiz Khalifa. 

“Wiz is like one of my best friends 
in the game,” Big Sean said. “We’ve 
known each other for a few years, it’s 
always nice touring with your friends. 
There’s going to be a lot of weed-
alige there, I’m sure [at their Sun 
God appearances, and on their tour]. 
Around, in the atmosphere.”

Between their debut appearance at 
this year’s Coachella Valley Music 
and Arts Festival and their scheduled 
headlining slot at England’s legend-
ary Glastonbury Festival, Jimmy Eat 
World’s teen-tapping has paid off.

“We had never played Coachella 
before, and that was always a goal 
of ours,” Lind said. “It’s still always a 
huge thrill to play those big festivals 
that we’ve been fortunate enough to 
be a part of.”

This year’s Sun God Festival won’t 
be J.E.W.’s first experience on campus. 
Before the platinum-selling albums 
and sold-out stadium shows, the god-
fathers of second wave emo got their 
start peeling paint off the walls of the 
Southwest’s more lovably dingy ven-
ues, including UCSD’s own Che Café. 

“We played the Che a handful of 
times in the mid-to-late ’90s,” Lind 
said. “It’s such a cool place. It’s always 
so nice to have something like that 
where bands can come play.”

But a quick bit of advice for this 
year’s festival attendees: don’t be 
deceived by all the uplifting lyrics and 
unbridled sensitivity. At a Jimmy Eat 
World concert, shit can get real. 

Of the flying debris in the audi-
ence during the band’s Coachella 
performance last month, Lind said: 
“Yeah, we see that happen a lot, actu-
ally. People want to promote their 
band, so they throw their demo or 
whatever up to the front. But if those 
things hit you, it could mean multiple 
stitches. I saw Davey von Bohlen of 
the Promise Ring get hit with a little 
jewel case, and it totally sliced his 
face.”

So whether you’ve come to bask 
in the sweet sound of nostalgia or 
drunkenly fist-pump to your favorite 
guilty pleasure, remember: try hold-
ing that death-wish raging at a low 
simmer, and please, for the love of

Associate Hiatus Editor

are you doing here?” and he said he 
has a house there and he lives there, 
and I said, “oh, that’s cool” [laughs]. 
And so he said, “You’re coming with 
me, you’re coming to the afterparty 
with me when we’re finished here,” 
and I said “alright.” And so I walked 
outside and he has this van that’s 
a storm chasing van. It has metal 
grates on the windows, all kinds of 
crazy antennas off of it, it’s all paint-
ed black. He told me that they like to 
be storm chasers, so whenever there’s 
tornados in the area they all load up 
in the car and go chase storms … It 
was really funny, too, because when 
I got in there and I sat down, he 
immediately hands me a Red Cross 
jacket and he says,  “If we get pulled 
over, just put this on and let me do 
all the talking.”
G: So would you go storm chasing if 
you had the chance?
DL: No! Not at all! That’s some … 
that’s some crazy … that’s some 
crazy, uh …
JP: I can tell what he’s about to say 
is, “That’s some white people shit.”
DL: That’s some white people shit!
G: Jon, would you go? 
JP: Would I go? Seeing that I’m 
white, hell yeah!
G: I’m going to hold you to that. If 
there’s ever a tornado in California, 
you better be out there!
DL: Oh dude, oh my god dude!
JP: Daniel’s dog just farted and it 
smells like ass!
DL: That’s just Nugget. I have a little 
French bulldog named Nugget and 
he’s in the studio with us today.  
G: You guys just finished a remix of 
Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.” What 
was that experience like?
DL: We’ve never had to deal with a 
deadline like that before.
JP: They literally gave us the parts 
and said, “Can you have this by 5 pm 
tomorrow?”
DL: We were supposed to get the 
track on a Saturday, but it wasn’t 
ready and then they finally called 

us in on a Tuesday morning. We sat 
down and found out that the reason 
they couldn’t get it to us until that 
morning was because up until the 
night before she was still working on 
the song. And nothing goes online. 
They literally flew everything out 
from New York to LA for us to hear 
it, and then they gave us the stems 
for it and we had a little more than 
24 hours to do it and turn it in and 
that’s not — I mean, normally you’re 
given a few weeks to do a remix. 
G: Now that you’ve done Gaga, is 
there anyone else you have a burning 
desire to remix?
DL: I think we’re going to focus on 
original material. The roster of peo-
ple we’ve worked with — everybody 
from Kylie Minogue to Weezer to 
Kings of Leon to people like Tiesto 
and stuff like that. We’ve worked 
with people who are pretty much the 
biggest acts in their genres, so we’re 
going to sit back and work on our 
own stuff now.  
G: Coming from LA, do you think 
there’s a different energy in San 
Diego?
DL: Voyeur in San Diego is pretty 
much in our top three clubs in the 
world to play at. I mean, we play 
at everywhere and the vibe in that 
place is unlike any other place in the 
world.
G: What can we expect at Sun God?
JP: What’s that? Is that in San Diego?
DL: Yeah, that’s this Friday. That’s 
what this interview’s about.
[All laugh]
JP: Something coherent. You can 
expect that. Play our best music, put 
our best show on. We’ve got a lot of 
new tracks from our buddies, stuff 
from Chris Blake, our own stuff.
G: How would you describe your 
music now?
DL: Upfront dance music. We’re not 
showy DJs. We’re not going to jump 
up in the air and act like we’re doing 
anything other than what DJs are 
doing, which is mixing two things 
together. No one’s up there with a 
guitar.

About Chapman University
Chapman University is one of California’s oldest 

and most respected private universities. Tracing its 

heritage to 1861 — and celebrating that 150-year-

old heritage throughout 2011 — the university now 

excels in the sciences, business, law, humanities, 

educational studies, fi lm and media arts and 

performing arts.

An Important Message to the UCSD Greek Community
and to All Our Fellow UCSD Students:

�is open letter is intended to call your attention to a serious problem that is occurring on this campus.

In many fraternities, new members are assigned a Big Brother to mentor them through the orientation and candidate education process. At 
UCSD, some fraternities also select a Big Sister to help in that process. �ese Big Sisters are usually members of UCSD Sororities. �e intent 

of this mentoring process is honorable (and fun), but it has unfortunately evolved to a point where potentially dangerous activities occur.

At UCSD, some Big Brothers and Big Sisters conduct something called “Tuck Ins” with some of their new members. �ese “Tuck-Ins” 
usually involve a drinking game where large quantities of alcohol are consumed. UCSD’s Greek Council prohibited these Tuck-Ins several 

years ago, but the practice has continued as an underground activity; some members of our fraternity have recently conducted a Tuck-In, and 
the Tuck-In went terribly wrong. We want to share this experience with all of you and we want to help put a stop to this dangerous practice.

One of our new members (who was under 21 years old) consumed too much alcohol at the Tuck-In. Many of his brothers and some mem-
bers of a UCSD Sorority encouraged the alcohol consumption, and they allowed our new brother to overindulge. None of the attendees was 
qualified or willing to stop the overindulgence, and this might have resulted in our brother’s demise. We were all very lucky that we did not 

lose our new brother. We understand that a few years ago, a student at another university (not a member of SAM) died from participating in 
a Tuck-In. Due to our own “close call”, we have learned from the experience.

We want to put an end to the potentially deadly practice of Tuck-Ins, but we need the help of everyone in our university community. It is 
vital to the safety of all students that we agree, collectively and individually, that we will not tolerate Tuck-Ins.

Going forward, our leaders will work hard to prevent this dangerous practice. However, the real burden lies with individual students. �e 
cold, hard fact is that (no matter what peer pressure dictates), tolerating Tuck-Ins is like playing Russian Roulette with your brothers and 

sisters lives, those friends whom we should protect and care about most.

�ank you,
�e Members of Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity, Gamma Rho Chapter

caught me off guard.
At � rst I didn’t recognize my symptoms as mental illness – I 
thought I was just having some bad days. Then, I learned that 
1 in 4 adults experience mental health challenges such as 
depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and others. I got help and 
now I am moving forward with my life. Recovery is possible and 
getting help is an important � rst step.

Funded by the Mental Health Services Act

with 277 blocks, and in fifth place 
with 522 career digs. 

With these feats in mind, 
it wouldn’t be surprising to find 
Bannan to have something of an ego. 
But on the contrary, he’s an easygo-
ing, well-rounded student ready to 
his team rather than himself, and 
who’s excited for the opportunities 
in his future. It is the valuable les-
sons he learned as being part of a 
team — not all his many records 
— that Bannan remembers as the 
hallmark of his time on the volley-
ball team.

His efforts also earned him the 
distinction of being a San Diego Hall 
of Champions Star of the Month 
for February. Overall this season, 
Bannan averaged 9.84 assists, .51 
service aces, 1.24 digs, .63 blocks 
and 1.53 points per set.

But Bannan dismisses the 
remarkable statistics he achieved as 
just a part of what it means to play 
volleyball. 

“It has been great being able 
to play all four years and get all 

that experience out on the court,” 
Bannan said. “Striving to achieve 
those records is just something that 
came along with it. I was really 
thankful for the opportunity to keep 
playing that much.”

In high school, Bannan 
showed early signs of 
promise that made him 
a top recruit for UCSD. 
His high school team at 
Corona del Mar won two 
California Interscholastic 
Federation (CIF) cham-
pionships going 33-2 
in 2007, the same year 
Bannan was awarded 
MVP of the CIF and 
Pacific Coast League. 
Bannan knew UCSD 
would give him a chance 
to be a prominent mem-
ber of a good volleyball 
team. The opportunity to 
excel on the court was 
one of the main reasons he ended 
up at UCSD. 

“Coming in, I knew I had a 
shot of maybe getting a lot of play-

ing time and maybe even starting 
as a freshman,” Bannan said. “The 
other setter graduated before me, 
so I knew there was an opportunity 
coming in [for] playing time.” 

This season for 
the men’s volley-
ball team was an 
inconsistent one, 
with a number of 
striking victories 
against top-rank-
ing universities, as 
well as close losses 
that shouldn’t have 
occurred. 

A l t h o u g h 
Bannan acknowl-
edged the disap-
pointments of the 
season, he was 
proud to say that 
this year the team 
achieved more than 
they had initially 

hoped, as a number of last year’s 
starters graduated. 

“Other teams were probably 
thinking that we were going to have 
an off year and we would just be 
an easy win on the schedule, but I 
felt like we made our mark and we 
put ourselves on the map and still 
competed every night,” Bannan said. 
“We had some quality wins against 
Stanford, UCLA, Pepperdine, 
Hawaii and Ohio State, whose team 
is also in the final four right now. 
We know that we can play with all 
the top teams, but some nights were 
quick and some nights it just wasn’t 
there.”

The volleyball community would 
agree that UCSD brought a tough 
battle this year: On May 7, Ohio 
State beat UCSB to take the NCAA 
Division-I championship — and 
UCSD beat both teams this season. 

“It is cool to be able to see the 
teams we played and beat on nation-
al television, on CNN,” said Bannan. 

“It shows how in our conference, 
anyone can go out and play and win 
each night; it is a high level of com-
petition. It feels pretty good seeing 
the team you beat win the national 
title.”

In addition to his outstanding 
volleyball career, Bannan has had a 
fulfilling four years academically. As 
a freshman, he thought he wanted to 
be a veterinarian, having grown up 
with dogs his whole life. But after 
taking a lower-division chemistry 
class, Bannan decided a major in the 
sciences wasn’t for him. 

“I started talking to my friends 
and some upperclassmen on the vol-
leyball team, and I found out about 
the communications department,” 
Bannan said. “I took their introduc-
tion class and was really intrigued. I 
found out I was going to take a dif-
ferent path with my education, and I 
am glad I did now. I have gotten into 
writing and editorials, and I had an 
internship with a surfing magazine 
last summer, so all the writing expe-
rience of being a communications 
major helped me do well.”

Through a communications 
course assignment, Bannan got in 
contact with Evan Flater, a UCSD 
alumnus and professional surfer 
who works at Hurley and was able 
to land him a web and media intern-
ship for the summer. Working for 
Hurley included digital content 
management and editorial work, as 
well as interviewing and writing 
stories about their team. What stood 
out most to Bannan, though, was 
his opportunity to plan and pro-
duce two contests: the U.S. Open of 
Surfing in Huntington Beach and 
Hurley Pro at Trestles.

“Especially at the contests, we 
worked in a team, with every-
one working on tasks and work-
ing together to help run the entire 
event,” Bannan said. “This relates 
to volleyball because everyone has 

to work together and do their part, 
and it shows teamwork and leader-
ship that comes along with doing an 
athletic sport. The volleyball team 
helped me to work with others and 
get the job done.”

Bannan’s experience on the vol-
leyball team included a lot of ath-
letic honors and impressive play-
ing, but he isn’t boastful. Instead, 
Bannan focuses on the stability the 
volleyball team brought him for his 
social life and the lessons and skills 
he learned that he can apply to his 
post-grad career. 

This summer, Bannan plans to 
return to Hurley, and hopes the 
internship will lead to a full-time 
position. Getting involved, he 
insists, was the best choice of his 
four years. 

“As far as [advice for] incom-
ing freshmen, I would just say be 
sure to get involved,” Bannan said. 
“Whether you find a good friend 
group in your dorm, or play a sport 
— whether it is club or intramu-
rals — stay active and that way, 
especially in your first year, you will 
find some great people that you will 
be able to hang out with and spend 
the next couple of years with. Just 
go out and explore and see what the 
university has to offer.”

Despite his success as a volley-
ball player, Bannan views his ath-
letic career mostly as a conduit for 
the other great things that lie ahead.

“In general, I had a really fun 
four years and volleyball got me 
into a great school, UCSD, and I am 
thankful for the opportunities that 
it gave me here,” Bannan said. “I got 
a great education and some con-
nections for the future after college, 
and I have made some great friends 
on the team that I am sure to keep 
after college.”

CRUNCH TIME

Four UCSD teams are in post season action this weekend: women’s waterpolo, softball, baseball and tennis.

It’s a big weekend for UCSD athletics. As most of UCSD 
prepares to celebrate at the Sun God Festival, three teams 
are headed to postseason play, with two off to the NCAA 
Championships. 

The No. 14 women’s water polo team will take on No. 2 UC 
Berkeley in the opening round of the NCAA Championships. 
UCSD is the seventh seed in the tournament, while UC Berkeley 
is the second seed. This is the Tritons’ first appearance in the 
tournament since the NCAA made women’s water polo an official 
sport in 2001.

The No. 16 softball team is set to play Central Washington 
in the first round of the West Region of the NCAA Division-II 
Championships. UCSD is the top seed in the region, with the 
winner advancing to Super Regionals. 

Finally, the No. 7 Triton baseball team will face Cal Poly 
Pomona in the opening round of the CCAA tournament. The 
Tritons are the top seed, and will look to win the tournament for 
the third consecutive year.

The previously undefeated men’s tennis team fell 5-0 to 
Columbia State in the opening round of the NCAA Division- II 
Championships. More to come in Monday’s issue of the Guardian.

Watch the match live at http://www.ncaa.com at 11 a.m. on Thursday.

That’s why he’s...

“...probably the best  
player we’ve ever had.”

Phil Bannan is one of the most impressive athletes UCSD has seen. As a set-ter on the men’s volleyball 
team, he’s been one of its most 
valuable players for each of his four 
years. 

“He is probably the best player 
we’ve ever had,” head coach Kevin 
Ring said. “When you look at the 
four years of experience, he’s defi-
nitely one of the best.”

Bannan, recently named to 
the All-Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation (MPSF) Second Team, 
broke UCSD records for career 
assists and service aces, ultimately 
collecting 4,399 assists and 110 aces. 
In addition to overtaking the previ-
ous records for assists and service 
aces, he found himself tied for third
