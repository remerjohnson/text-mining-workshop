UC Considering the Semester System 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
AiSOt'ia&e Manalinl Editor 

The Academic AHairs Vice 
Chancellors at each UCcampus 
are considering a switch from 
the quarter system to 
semesters that could come as 
early as the lN0-81 academic 
year. 

Consideration of the change 
was brought about by a letter . 
from Berkeley Academic 
Affairs Vice Chancellor Mi-
chael Haymond to systemwid, 
administration asking if 
Berkeley could switch systems 
without each school in the 
system doing so. 

UC President David Saxon's 
answer was no, so each school' 
Vice Chancellor is being asked 
to consider the semester 
system and report back at a 
Council of Vice Chancellors 
meeting to be held next month, 

Berkeley Supports Chance 
Albert Bowker, Berkeley's 

Chancellor, says the UC 
system's ori,inal reason for 
switching {rom semesters to 
quarters in the early sixties, 
becoming a year round school, 
has proven "romantic and 
silly .. ,a terrible flop." 

Bowker argues that a change 
to se'mesters would allow for 

"more concentrated cour es, 
and would make lab classes 
easier to schedule. " 

He says the chief reason for 
the change, though, is to make 
registrdlion a simpler process. 

"Registration is becoming 
increasingly complex and 
difficult to administer ... , 
having registration twice a 
year instead of three times will 
be better for everyone, 
including students. " 

The Berkeley Academic 
Senate has also shown its 
" overwhelming" support oCtile 
change to semesters, Bowker 
adds. 

UCSD ha dealt with the 
semesters i sue by consulting 
with the various Provosts and 
College Councils, as well as the 
AS through Academic Affairs 
Commissioner Margot Tem-
pereau , according to Paul 
Saltman, Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs here. 

Saltman says his major 
reason for looking at the 
semester system is financial. 
" If we could save $200,000 on 
each campus by changing, it 
would be worth it." 

He also cites the academic 
gains. "The people in 

humanitie ," he ays, "a 
delighted at the pro pect oC a 
semester system." 

The major problem with 
adaptation of two semesters 
would be the need to rE-evaluate 
the course content oC each 
sequence, SCtitman says, "as 
well as the los oC flexibility in 
class offerings." 

Saltman says that if there is a 
change, it will probably come in 
time for the 1980-81 school year. 

Irvine Study 
Saltman' s belief that the 

change will save money i 
being tested at Irvine.

KSDT Okays Navy Ad 
Passes With 22-8-2 Vote; Station GM Insists 
Vote is 'Not an Endorsement' of Military 

By Kathy Huffer 
Senior Staff Writer 

Radio station KSDT rejected 
its moral stance on the military 
in favor of economics 
Wednesday night in its decision 
to air advertisements pro-
moting the Navy. 

F!oding a rel:ent controversy 
over KSDT's adverti ing policy 
and its need for fund , the 
station's general staff 
approveQ the use of Navy ads in 
a 22-8-2 vote. 

The vote i " not an 
endorsement of the Navy," 
according to KSDT Bu iness 
Manager Ralph Hawkin , but 
indicates that station members 
" understand that there is a 
shortness of funds ." 

Station members spent 
nearly two hour in debate 
before voting to accept the 
advertising. Faced with debts 
owed to the AS and KSDT 's 
opposition to the military, 
Hawkins called the vote "a 
tough decision." 

The staff mandated that 
KSDT contract with the Navy 
on a temporary basis through 
the first of July. After that 
date, continued airing of Navy 
advertisements must be put to 
a general staff vote, 

In addition, KSDT members 
voted to have the option of 
producing the Navy ads. AS 
President John Jenkel , 
speaking during the meeting, 

. suggested that the station

" produce (ads) with the

Hawkins recently asked the 
AS to give KSDT a recom-
mendation on the airing of 
Navy ad. Although the AS 
advi ed the 'tation to contract 
with the Navy, Hawkins aid 
the recommendation had only 
"a little impact" on KSDT's 
vote and commented that staff 
member " weren ' t reacting to 
AS a a threat." 

Jenkel ~as e timated that the 
station owes the AS between $4-

KSDT for it conversion to

Is a Moslem Common 
Market in the Future? 
" .. . is significant because it reveals the ability of Islam to 
transcend geographical, racial, and political 
divisions ... 

By Mobsin Ali 
Pacific News Service 

Can faith in Islam be translated into economic cooperation 
that will improve the lives of the Moslem faithful - some Jiving 
in the world's poorest, others in some of the richest countries on 
earth? 

Some 100 businessmen from 29 Islamic countries in Asia and 
Africa recently met in Pakistan to found the Islamic Chamber 
of Commerce, Industry and Commodity exchange. In M~rch 
·the group's executive committee will gather in ~a.udi Arab~a to 
scrutinize a series of experts' reports and feaSibility studies. 

The Gu8rd" Fri •• M..-ch 11. 1179 

MoItsln Ali, former edUor of lhe Morning News, Karacbi, and 
contributor to tbe Christian Science Monitor, is a Pakistani 
freelance joum . .:::a::;lI:::st:.:. _________ _ 

The goal: a Common Market of Islamic countries which 
would include nearly one-sixth of the world's population and a 
far higher proportion of the earth's energy reserves. 

The Wizard of Allegory 
Like the Karachi meeting, the plenary council scheduled to 

open in Jeddah next month is significant because it reveals the 
ability of Islam to transcend geographical, racial and political 
divisions. Participants in the efforts to forge greater Islamic 
economic cooperation range politically from pro-Soviet 
Afahanistan to anti-communist Saudi Arabia, and include non-
Arabic countries like Malaysia and Turkey. 

L. Frank Baum's Short Story is Really a Bitter 
Attack on Turn of the Century Politics 

Rather than mere conventional increases in trade, 
transportation. tourism and commerce among themselves, the 
founders of the organization want a massive pooling oC 
resources in shipping, insurance, banking. manpower 
planning, and influence over petr<rdollar lending policies. 

One unanimous recommendation urges that the Islamic 
OPEC countries advance credits to other Moslem countries on 
the explicit condition that the loans are utilized within the 
Moslem world. 

Several Moslem countries, it is argued. have reached a stage 
of development adequate to the needs of simple manuCactures 
and technologies oC other developing Moslem states. 
. Experts are also working out joint ventures to form shipping 
companies as a way of easing exchanges of goods and 
commodities. Funds to buy ships would come Crom the Jeddah-
based Islamic Development Bank. which started a year ago 
with a capital oC two billion dollars . Initially, Cour Islamic 
Conference lines of mercantile shipping will be set up to cover 
the Mediterranean. the Red Sea, theGulf and the Indian Ocean. 

A striking feature of the conference was its strong plea Cor 
private enterprise. To " make the role of the private sector 
more effective" the businessmen demanded, among other 
things: easing of visa restrictions on business travel; reduction 
oC trade and tariff barriers; and commodity price stabilization 
agreements. 

Subcommittees also are dealing with the establishment of 
Islamic Mutual Funds Cor industrial expansion, interest-Cree 
loans and joint investment companies. 

But should the calls Cor Islamic economic solidarity be 
translated into eCCective action. an Islamic Common Market 
could unite energy resources and populations greater than the 
European Common Market, the United States and Japan 
combined.

Whether they are fans of 
Judy Garland and • 'Over the 
Rainbow" 'or preCer the recent 
$20 million black film with 
Diana Ross and "No Bad 
News," almost all Americans 
know the characters Crom "The 
Wizard 01 Oz." But few are 
aware that the story was 
originally written as a political 
allegory. 

Peter Dreier is an assistant 
professor of sociology at Tufts 
University where he teaches a 
course on film and politics. 

It may seem harder to 
believe than the Emerald City, 
but the Tin Woodsman is the 
industrial worker , the 
'Scarecrow the struggling 
farmer , and the Wizard is the 
President, who is powerful only 
as long as he succeeds in 
deceiving the people. 

" The Wonderful Wizard oC 
Oz" was written by Lyman 
Frank Baum in 1900. during the 
collapse of the Populist 
movement. Through the 
Populist Party , Midwestern 
farmers, in alliance with somt>

economic interests that 
squeezed farmers through low 
prices, high freight rates and 
continued indebtedness. 

The Populists advocated 
government ownership of 

. railroads, telephone and 
telegraph industries. They also 
wanted silver coinage. Their 
power grew during the 1893 
depression, the worst in U.S. 
history till then, as Carm prices 
sank to new lows and 
unemployment was wide· 
spread. 

In 1894, Jacob S. Co xey , a 
Populist lumber dearer from 
Massillon, Ohio, led a mass 
march of unemployed workers 
to Washington to demand a 
federal works program. That· 
same year. President Grover 
Cleveland called in federal 
troops to put down the 
nationwide Pullman strike - at 
that time, the largest strike in 
American History. As the 
Populists saw things. the 
monopolies were growing 
richer , the workers and 
Carmers, ever poorer. 

In the 1894 Congressional 
elections. the Populist Party 
got almost 40 percent of the 
vote. It looked Corward to 
winning the Presidency, and 
the silver standard, in 1896. 

But in that election, which 
revolved around the issue of 
gold vs . silver, Populist-
Democrat William Jennings 
Bryan lost to Republican 
William McKinley by 95 
electoral votes . Bryan , a 
congressman from Nebraska 
and a gifted orator, ran again in 
1900, but the Populist strength 
was gone. 

Baum viewed these events in 
both rural South Dakota -
where he edited a local weekly 
- and urban Chicago - where 
he wrote Oz: He mourned the 
destruction oC the fragile 
alliance between the Mid-
western farmers (the Scare-
crow) and the urban Industrial 
workers (the tin man) . Along 
with Bryan (the Cowardly Lion 
with a roar bullittle else) , they 
had been taken down the)lellow 
brick road (the gold standard) 
that led nowhere . Each 
journeyed . to Emerald City 
seeking lavor from the Wizard 
of Oz (the President) . Dorothy, 
the symbol of Everyman, went 
along with them. innocent 
enough to see the truth before 
the others. 

Along the way they meet the 

Wicked Witch of the East who, 
Baum tells us, had kept the 
little MUAchkin people "in 
bondage for many years, 
making them slave for her 
night and day." She had also 
put a spell on the Tin 
Woodsman, once an inde-
pendent and hardworking man, 
so that each time he swung his 
axe, it chopped off a different 
part of his body. Lackj.ng 
another trade, he " worked 
harder than ever," becoming 
like a machine.' apable of 
love, yeaming for a heart. The 
Wicked Witch of the West 
clearly symbolizes the large 
industrial corporations. 

Like Coxey's Army, the small 
group heads toward Emerald 
City where the Wizard rules 
from behind a papier mache 
facade. Oz, by the way, is the 
abbreviation for ounce. the 
standard measure for gold. 

Like all good politicians, the 
Wizard can be all things to all 
people. Dorothy sees him as an 
enormous head. The Scarecrow 
sees a gossamer fairy. The 
Woodsman sees an awful beast, 
the Cowardly Lion .. a ball of 
fire. so fierce and glowing he 
could scarcely bear to gaze 
upon it. " 

Later, however, when they 
confront the Wizard directly, 
they see he is nothing more than 
" a little man, with a bald head 
and a wrinkled face. " 

"I have been making 
believe," the Wizard conCesses. 
"I'm just a common'man." But 
the Scarecrow adds, "You're 
more than that ... you ' re a 
humbug." 

" It was a ,reat mistake my 
ever letting you into the Throne 
Room," admits the Wizard, a 
former ventriloquist and circul 
balloonist from Omaha. 

This was Baum's ultimate 
Populist messa,e. The powers-
that-be survive by deception. 
Only people's ignorance allows 
the powerful to manipulate and 
control them. 

Dorothy returns to KIln.'188 
with the magical help of her 
Silver Shoes (the sliver Is \Ie) . 
but when she gets to Kansas 
she realizes her shoes "had 
fallen off in her night lhroullh 
the air, and were 10lt forever in 
the desert." Still. she is safe at 
horne- with Aunt Em and Uncle 
Henry . imple farmer.

BOYCOTT FINALS 

Students are hereby requested to 
boycott final exams - they are much too 
serious for silly students. It has been a 
long-term administration ploy to 
undermine the Silly Student Organization 
by requiring finals. The Silly Students are 
not capable of serious study and are 
therefore at a great disadvantage when 
presented with Finals. So, help us protest. 

Be Silly. Boycott your Finals.

AS Esta-blishes 
Ele'ctions Code 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Maaalln, Editor 

The stage was set Wednesday 
night for a prolusion o( 
campaign pamphlets, posters 
and propaganda_ 

The As Council approved 
campaign regulations for next 
quarter's AS elections, making 
three major changes in the way 
campaigns will be conducted. 

For the first time. candidates 
will be required to disclose the 
source of campaign contri-
butions. While the Elections 
Board will have no formal way 
of monitoring contributions , 
Public Relations Commis-
sioner Carlos Montalvo, who 
has tal ked about running for an 
office next quarter. says the 
requirement "is just a start; 
next year we can get stricter 
provisions to the disclosure 
requirement. " 

The campaign has also been 
shortened (rom five weeks to 
four. The first election will be 
on Wednesday and Thursday of 
the fourth week. the run-off 
election, if necessary , to be held 
two weeks later. 

Finally. candidates will be 
required to register all 
campaign workers with the 
Elections Board as " official 
agents." The provision was 
added to help keep track' of 
which people can and cannot 
" tamper " with campaign 
literature, Elections Com-
missioner Phil Ganezer says. 

Another change. designed to 
raise the spending limit from 
$50 to $80 (or commissioner 
candidates, was approved by 
the AS Rules Committee. but 

then restored to the original $SO 
on the Council Cloor despite 
Ganezer's assertion that a 
"great number o( candidates 
went over the (spending) Limit 
last year, and this year we are 
going to be stricter. 

Student Welfare Commis-
sioner Barry Hyman. though. 
argued that an $80 limit would 
cause enough propaganda to 
"overrun" the campus, adding 
that $50 was more than enough 
to run a campaign. 

In other action Wednesday 
night, the AS Council: 
-approved continued funding 
of the "AS Bulletin Board," a 
half page weekly ad in The 
Guardian (or student organi-
zations; 
-decided to form a committee 
to work up a referendum about 
the Coffee Hut. The referendum 
is planned for the same time as 
the general election: 
-passed a resolution to co-
sponsor a food drive with 
MEChA to aid the striking 
United Farm Workers. 

Proposal 
(Conllnued from page I) 
have the choice to fulfill their 
Humanities/Sodal Science 
year course option by taking a 
(oreign language course. 

According to Loveberg. the 
proposal. which only needed a 
simple majority to pass, met a 
hostile recept.ion. " I was 
surprised by the strength of the 
disapproval ," he said. In fact, 
Loveberg stated, the margin of 
defeat was so great, with more 
than two-thirds against that an 

. exact count was not made.

UC in Good Shape, Regent Says 
By Eric Jaye 

1\1 analinl EdliOl" 
Speaking with the perspec-

tive thirteen years as UC 
Regent can bring, DeWitt 
Higgs said last week that 
despite budget cu ts and 
Proposition 13 the sl.ate of the 
university is good and that he 
has every reason to be 
optimistic about its future. 

Higgs said that the Uni- \ 
versity of California is one of 
the "great" universities in the 
country and that it should 
remain so. . 

A prominent San Diego 
lawyer, Higgssaidthathehada 
special interest in 'UCSD, 
though he could not be "just a 
San Diego Regent. 

"I ' m proud of UCSD, 
particularly of Scripps and the 
Med school,'" said Higgs, who 
noted that UCSD plays a 
substantial role in the economy 
of San Diego. 

Higgs said thatothe~Regents 
share his respect for UCSD, and 
consider it to be a strong 
campus, especially in the areas 
of research and the medical 
school. 

Higgs was appointed to the 
Board of Regents in 1966 by 

Governor Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown and is in the thirteenth 
year of his 16-year term. Now 
71, Higgs came to San Diego in 
1930 and worked his way 
through law school by driving 
dynamite trucks at night.

because of low ·salaries, Higgs 
said , but UC will be unable to 
attract promising new faculty 
if the relative decline in 
salari s is not reversed. 

Higgs, who .served through 
the period of intense student 
acti "ism du ri ng the late sixties, 
had a few comments on /iomeof 
the issues which have sparked 
student prote t in recent years. 

Higg said he was against 
divestment of UC stocks in 
companies which do business in 
South Africa, commenting that 
he didn 't think such an act 
would · be of help at all to the 
people it was intended to. 

Also, said' Higgs, he wasn' t 
sure it was the place of the 
Regents to act on their "social 
conscious." 

On UC management of the 
Lawrence Livermore labs for 
the Federal Department of 
Energy, a n issue wh ich brought 
nearly 400 protesters to the last 
Regents meeti,ng in Los 
Angeles, Higgs said that he 
thought it was in the "national 
interest" for UC to manage the 
labs and that it should continue 
to do so.

" Movie music " is a 
deceptively simple sounding 
category for such a subtle art 
form. Movie music, at its best, 
is the smooth blending of one 
medium with another. "The 
score can make a great picture 
greater," according to David 
Shire (composer of All the 
President's Men among 
others) , " but it can't - save a·

think there is a danger that a 
bad score can hurt a good 
picture .. . there have been times 
when I'm enjoying a picture 
and suddenly a cue comes in 
that just throws everything orr 
balance." Shire for one feels 
that a score, while only an 
element of film, can have an 
important and beneficial 
impact on audiences: " ... they 
certainly notice if the music is 
appropriate and sets up the 
proper mood for the film ."

such as the use of Step pen wolf's 
"The Pusher" in conjunction 
with scenes of Dennis Hopper

Classical music has also been 
repeatedly employed by many 
directors, most notable Stanley

Another major form of film 
music is the musical. 
Unfortunately the musicals' 
golden age when MGM put out 
such classics as On the Town

passed, and musicals are a 
modern rarity. Occasionally, a 
musical suc h as Cabaret or 
Grease will stir a · renewed 
interest in the genre , but 
primarily the studios don't

inclination to produce high

'Killer Beat'· Affects Body 
By Monet Payton 

Stair Writer 
Most current music has a 

detrimental effect on the 
human body , said Jurgen 
Woelke in a lecture sponsored 
by the Alpha_ Omega Society 
early this quarter. 

Woelke, who spent six 
months in India studying 
Indian music and their 
philosophies concerning music 
and rhythm and has studied 
work done by noted re-
searchers in the field, 
discussed a "killer beat" which 
is found in much of today's 
music. 

When isolated and played 
continuously, this long-long-
short beat causes psychological 
and physiological disturbances 
in the subjects, Woelke said. 

A short-short-Iong beat has 
an opposite eCfect on the 
subject, however, causing him 
to feel relatively good, 
according to Woelke. 

After researchers located 
and isolated the killer and 
short-short-Iong beats and 
made a continuous recording of 
them, . said Welke. subjects 
were hooked up to motor 
response and feedback lines 

and exposed to the separate 
beats. 

The results of this research 
indicate that, for example, if a 
subject has a heart problem, 
the killer beat would make it 
worse and the short-short-Iong 
beat would first bring it back to 
normal and then improve the 
condition. According to 
Woelke, the eftects of the beats 
have ' "a lot to do with brain 
wave activity at the various 
frequencies ... 

Much psychological a nd 
physiologica l research is being 
done on the possible medicinal 
effects of music on the body . 

Music therapists have not yet 
been llble to identifv and 
pinpoint what types of music 
affect different part of the 
body . Said Woelke, the "work 
done has been based on 
intuitive and meditative 
sources rather than scientific." 

Through his research in 
India , Woelke developed a 
theory that rhythm affects 
different areas along the spine. 

According to this philosophy, 
the 4-4 rhythm affects the base 
of the spine, the 6-8 affects the 
area below the solar plexus , the 
5-4 affects the solar plexus, the 

12-8 a Hects the chest cavity, the 
H affects the heart , and the 2-4 
affects the area betwcen the 
eyebrows_ The 7-4 rhythm 
affects all centers at once and 
the 12-4 a Hects the outside 
body , Woelke's research 
indicates.

CME: Music in Its Time 
Kiva Plays for. Sound, Deemphasizes Structure 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Editor 

Pauline Oliveros, director of 
the UCSD Center for Music 
Experiment, describes ex-
perimental music as "music in 
its time." 

It just takes lime for new 
musical patterns to feel natural 
to people , accordi ng to 
Oliveros. 

Music experimentation is not 
something new. ~'Throughout 
the years, composers have 
innovated by introducing new 
kinds of instruments, asking 
that old ins~ruments be played 
in a new way a nd increasing the 
number 'of players in a n 
orchestra," Oliveros re-
marked. 

Acco('ding to Oliveros, a new 
trend in experimental music is 
allowing "a large ranie of 
people to take part in the music 
rather than just listen to it." 
Oliveros' " Meditation Project" 
involved students "whether 
they had music training or 
not." Her pu rpose in this 
project was to compose a sound 
that could be dwelled upon in a 
meditative way _ 

American composer John 

Cage ' is the .. inspiring 
innovator" in music , who 
coined the term " experimental 
music," said Oliveros. 

She cited Cage's " Atlas 
Eclipticalis," a piece derived 
from star maps , as an 
"extremely e"Xperimental 
approach " to music . "He 
superimposed staff lines over 
the star maps" .the size of the 
star meaning the dynamic, " 
Oliveros explained. 

UCSD's. Music department 
and CME have an internationa l 
reputation for its emphasis on 
"new " music, according to 
Oliveros . "All the music 
classes here are exposed to it," 
she said, "a long with the more 
traditional material." Oliveros 
sees -music experimentation as 
"a means of musical growth." 

Kiva 
Kiva, UCSD's three-man 

experimental music ensemble, 
deals directly with sound and 
deemphasizes preexistent 
music structures, according to 
Brad Dow, a Kiva musician. 

Along with Dow, who is a 
graduate stud!!nt in music, 
Kiva members are John Silber 
and Jean-Charles Francois.

Dow calls Kiva " a group of 
composers who don't com-
pose ... and make compositions 
which are not preconceived." 

Though Kiva " improvises," 
their performance is" not sheer 
spontaneity ," said Dow. " We 
know and remember what we 
do, " he explained. 

According to Dow, Kiva 
functions on sound . When 
performing, the group is " not 
looking for a tune, but ra ther 
the sound." Their music i 
centralized on the pitches of F" 
and C. 

Kiva ' s innova tive instru -
ments vary from a six-foot-long 
ha rmonic nute to a water 
phone, which is made from a 
washing machine tub and used 
as both a percussion and 
stringed instrument. 

When the ensemble formed in 
1974, the members decided to 
call themselves Kiva , a Hopi 
word in which " there is a sense 
of rebirth," said Dow. He sees 
the name as a " good symbol" of 
the ensemble because Ki va sets 
out to " redefine," rather than 
apply, the basics 0(' music. 

Kiva will be performing May 
12 at Mandevijle Auditorium.

Barry Cunningham , who 
resigned effective at the end of 
the 1978-79 season. 

The coach left USIU in 1977 
a nd spent this past season as a 
coach at Camp Pendleton and 
as a scoul for the Houston 
Rocket s of the National 
Basketba ll As ociation. 

nonscholarship school , it is 
important to get good freshmen 
and maybe a few junior college 
transfers and grow from 
there. ,. 

Kloppenberg acknowledged 
that UCSD's high transfer rate 
might hinder this growth 
process. " You' ve got to try to 
keep the same guys together for 
fou r years. Because of the high 
academic standards here you 
must start with good students, " 
the coach added. 

Dean Scarafone goes for the win. Tbe UCSD basebaJl team beat U of Utah yesterday 
IafILern04~n 4-3. Tom Nicholson pitched nine innings to pick up the win, while Mark Sharpe 

Kloppenberg, a graduate of 
Whittier College aDd Cal State 
Fresno, applied for the head job 
with the Tritons because he 
thought it would be an 
"interesting assignment. .. I 
realize the. guidelines of the 
program and 11m willing to 
work within them . I have no 
illusions of grandeur working 
under a nonscholarship 
program ," Kloppenberg 
remarked. He added that after 
coaching at the college level for 
twenty year~he missed it and 
wa nted to return to a college 
program. 

Kloppenberg will be looking 
for new talent this summer at 
the Idyllwild Basketball Camp, 
which is held for three weeks 
every summer at UCSD for 12 
to 18-year-old boys and girls. 
KIoppenberg is co-director of 
the camp, which will have the 
assista nce of two professional 
basketball play~rs this 

runs. The TrUons dropped two games to Biola College last weekend, but will go for a w 
against U 01 Wy()ming anlt a double-header nst Cal Lutheran tomorrow.

Coach John Helmich was 
very pleased with the team 's 
overall performance through-
out the season, including athird 
place league finish. 

Kassebaum placed fourth 
overall in the individual 
rankings and made the All-
Conference team . Lynn 
Demshki also did well with a 
number six position in the 
league. 

Coach Helmich is optimistic 
about next year's team with 
two returni ng fencers .. " We 
have a good chance of doing the 
sa me or bette r than this year." 

.. A good program must start 
with good freshmen ," ex -
pl a in ed the coach. "We're 
going to put more emphasis on 
the JV program and build from 
there . Especially in a 

Clippers). . 
Kloppenberg is no stranger to 

UCSD, having run the camp at 
this location for the past two 
summers. His son , Gary,

Softball' Team 
Suffers · 16-0 Loss 
By Cindy Bloadi 

Under clear blue skies 
Wednesday afternoon the 
Tritolf women's softball team 
suffered a tough 16-0 loss to 
SDSU in a game rescheduled 
(rom a previous rain-out. 

According to [irst year coach 
John Elliot, the Triton's 
weakness was inexperience. It 
was a battle of "skilled players 
(SDSU) against those still 
coming along (UCSD)," said 
the coach. 

Starting Triton pitcher Lynn 
Paul had some problems with 
control in her (our-inning 

effort. Jill Keene was put on the 
mound during the fifth inning 
and did fairly well. SDSU failed 
to score more than five runs 
after Keene replaced Paul . 
Keene has been with the team 
only a week, 

Another team asset is Lori 
Goldfarb, also ·'il women 's 
basketball player. Goldfarb did 
an excellent job in the outfield 
during Thursd ay's game. 
Coach Elliot plans to move her 
infield for the team 's next 
game. Goldfarb is the only 
returnee from last year's 
squad.

Gospel Choir One of 10 Ensembles 
"The repertoire of the 
choir includes tradi-
tional spi r ituals as well 
as modern com p o-
sitions In gos p e l 
music," 

By Lynette Tom 
Sl'nior Staff Wri t!'I' 

UCS1)'s gospel choir is lhe 
realization of a dream conjured 
by Urban and Rural Studies 
faculty member Tomie Kay 
Smith . For the past five years , 
it h as been under the 
directorship of Cecil Lytle. 
Currently , the group holds 45 
students of all majors and 
colleges a nd rehearses on 
Tuesdays from 6: 00 to 8: 00 pm 
a nd on Thursdays from 6: 00 to 
7: 00 pm in B-210. 
This i part two of a three part 

series on the music program. 

"The choir has turned 
into something quite 
amazing and identi-
fiable with UCSD .. ," 

The former group is a result 
o{ the mu ic department 's 
recent purchase of a set o{ four 
viola de gambas. Hours and 
location of its rehearsals are on 
a to-be-a nnounced schedu le. 
The six-member con ort also 
includes recorder . with 
emphasis placed upon the 
performance of early 
Renaissance music. Experi-
ence in playing eit h er 
instrument is not a prerequi-
site , but the ability to read 
music is recommended. The 
clas welcomes students from 
any college a nd any major. 

" The course covers a ll areas 
of A fro -American sacred 

music ,~' said Lytle . "The 
repertoire of the choir includes 
traditional spirituals as well as 
modern compositions i'D gospel 
music." 

-------- UCSD's Gospel Choir--------
" The group is open to people 

of a ll levels , " said Foster. " The 
course consists of instruction 
on the in trument for the 
beginners and rehearsal for the 
expe rienced students." 

While students need not have 
a musical background, it is 
advantageous, as Lytle is 
looking Cor individuals who are 
" singable with a good pitch 
sense , excellenl memory, a nd a 
flair in improvisation ." 
Auditions {or entrance into the 
choir are divided into two parts. 
First, sludents are allowed to 

s ing anything they wi sh , 
provided that lheir selections 
are similar to the material that 
will be studied in the course. 
This determines the style and 
techniques used by the 
students. Second , Lytle plays 
eight measures of music with 
lyrics several times and has the 
students sing it to him, in order 
10 see how quickly and

.Strong Research 
Makes 'Agatha' 
Successful 

., By Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Wrilf'r 

December of 1926 proved to 
be a month of double success 
for mystery writer Agatha 
Christie. While the readers 
were intrigue'd by the 
imaginary accounts in her 
newest work, The Murder o( 
Roger Ackroyd , the police were 
equally as bllffled by the real· 
liCe di sa ppea rance of the 
celebra ted authoress. Thus 
provides the framework for 
Wa rner Brothers ' Agatha , 
which attempts to explain why 

. she vanished for a period of 
eleven days. 

The research that Kathleen 
Tynan went through in order to 
write the story and collaborate 
on the screenplay with Arthur 
Hopc r a rt rival s that of 
Christie's litera ry sleuthess, 
Miss Jean Marple, herself. The 
result is a motion picture of 
romantic undertones, which 
has none of the fl as hy 
Hollywood nuances and larger-
than-life cli ches commonly 
seen in fictional depictions of 
famed personali ties . Although 
Agatha does have a tendency to 
drag a bit, the viewers a re, by 
no means . bored . Vittorio 
Storaro's cinematography of 
the English countryside and 
Londoni an arc hit ectu re 
discourklge. any threat of 
nodding oCr. 

Vane a Redgravc" por· 
trayal of the noveli st is 
sensitive and reserved. It is a 
fine follow·up to her Academy· 
winning performa nce in Julia, 
where she also played the title 
role. In height, she dwarfs co· 

star Dustin Horfman by a good 
twelve inches. As a result. their 
romantic scenes are awkward, 
a lmost comical to watch. 
However , his part of visiting 
American new s columnist 
Wally Stanton is far from 
falling short of acclaim . 
Timothy Da lton is wickedly 
delightful as the writer' s sullen. 
philandering husband, AI·chi· 
bald Chri tie. Helen Morse 
miltches it in cheerfulness as 
the worn a n ' s ex troverted 

aC\.j~ai ntence, Evelyn Crawley. 
When Agatha bri tie died in 

1976, so too did the hopes of ever 
so lving her mysterious 
departure from the public eye. 
With the assista nce of Warner 
Brothers, Knthleen Ty na n 
succeeds in cleari ng up so me of 
the ob curity vi<l the film, 
Agatha.

First lesson: 
Bonded Bourbon is so 
unique that it took an 
act of Congress (in 1897) 
to establisn the 
standards for 
Old Grand-Dad 
and other Bonded 
Whiskeys. 

Old Gran:! d Bonded 
Kentucky sour-mash 

Bourbon, de with pure limestone 
water, tht' est graiN, and aged in new 
charred-(,u barrels. 

I 
Only Bonded 

whiskeys have a green 
tax stamp, It's your guar-
antee that the whiskey is 
at least four years old. 
Old Grand-Dad Bonded is 
a/ways aged longer, 

100 is perfect, 
Bonded Bourbon 
must be 100 proof. 
No more. No less. 

Final exam. 
You need only one 
sip to recognize 
the clearly superior 
quality and taste of 
Old Grand-Dad.

Coach 
Named 

(Continued from page 12) 
Out or ten applicants who 

applied for the head position, 
four were interviewed by a 
committee composed or the 
intercollegiate athletic 
director, a raculty member, 
and two basketball players. 

"We felt that Bob had the 
expertise and experience in 
basketball to fill the role of 
coach at UCSD," commented 
Judy Sweet, Intercollegiate 
Athletic Director. "His sincere 
desire to work within the 
framework of our program and 
make it into the best j.lrogram 

. possible, made him our number 
one choice." 

Kloppenberg h as not yet 
named his assi tant coach. 

Semester. 
(Continued from pale 1) . 

As part or that campus' s tudy 
of the semester ystem, the 
I rvine Budget Affairs office i 
formCilly investigating how 
much money the chool will 
save by changing academic 
calendars.. 

The study is due early next 
week, but J a mes McGaugh, 
Vi e Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs there , told The 
Guardian yesterday that " my 
feeling is that any savings 
would be modest.. .a change 
would have to be made rorother 
reasons. " 

Irvine conducted a s imilar 
study a few years ago , 
McGaugh says, and it showed 
that at least some money would 
be sa ved by a switch. 

Student Opinion 
Student have not been 

active ly involved in the process 
of change. 

Bret Hewitt , UC Student 
Lobby Co-director, says the 
lobby hasn' t taken a stand on 
the sw itch, but believes that 
when it does , it will probably 
come down against it, lor two 
re",sons . 

"First. students haven ' tbeen 
consulted in the change. 
Second. I think the change 
would allow everyone in the 
system to be lazier. Professors 
wouldn 't have to do as much, 
administrators wouldn't hClve 
to do as much and students 
wouldn't have to do as much. 
That hurts the quality or 
education." 

Pam Goldschmidt, Berkeley 
AS Academic Arrairs Vice 
President, says a switch is 
"impossible." 

"We just don't have enough 
building space," Goldschmidt 
says . 

She concedes, thoUlh, that a 
change "probably would save 
money, and Bowker says 
Berkeley Is not pressed ror 
space except ror laboratory 
classes. That shortage, Bowker 
arlues, would actually be 
alleviated Ir the emelter 
system were adopted.

At the syatemwide level, the 
respoue bas been minimal to 
flnaneial problem. caused by 
the political blrbulence ill Iran. 
Rather, many students have 
been slipped Into a financial aid 
system with diIrering abilities 
to help them at different 
campuses. 

The reason the system 
remains In the bacqround is 
that money may not be 
earmarked for a specific ethnic 
group. Almost all the campus 
financial aid oCfiers contacted 
by The Guardian freely 
discussed the problem in terms 
oC Iranian students , but 
Marilyn Yeager of the. 
systemwide office took great 
pain to make it clear that no 
special re ponse to the Iranian 
need was coming at her level. 

Not that the UC adminis-
trators are not concerned with 
Iranian students' problems. 
Margaret Heisel , senior 
analyst in student affairs and 
services, told o( quick reaction 
to a new Corm issued by the 
Immigration and N aturali-

AUon Service in Northern 
CaUlorala willa .. at le88t one 

. queation that wa, improper ... 
The new procedure II part 01 

an ercort to counter foreilll 
Itudent acUviam after the riota 
in Beverly HUla at the home of 
the Shah', mother. 

It aaked forel.n Itudent 
advisers at Nortlaern Califorala 
colleges and universities to 
certify that each foreiln 
Itudent was not eqaled In 
"any activity deemed iacon-
,istent with continued presence 
in this country, e.g. partici-
pating in violent demon-
strations, disruptive or 
irresponslbl~ behavior, or 
compiling an arrest record." 

A legal opinion from the UC 
system was obtained, saying 
tht' question violates the 
Buckley (privacy) amend-
ment. Immigration was 
notified that the UC foreign 
student advisers "could not 
comply," Heisel said. 

The issue is not settled. 
especially since a bill 
introduced in the state 
legislature this session (AB 
526) would penalize any foreign 
student who nas engaged in any 
illegal activity. according to 
Heisel. But it illustrates the 
way in which the systemwide 
administration can deal with 
the students' problems. 

They also figure into the 
financial situation , peri-
pherally. Every year they 
evaluate resources available at 
this time of year to meet 
unex pected needs (for 
whatever reason) at each 
campus. and allocate addi-

tiona I rinancial ai.d money 
where they think it should '0, 

Many of the nnaneial aid 
officers. and UCSD Dean of 
International Education Joan 
Walah, regarded the spring 
quarter money as a potential 
godsend to the needy 
foreltners. But the money is 
allocated to individual 
campuses based on their 
financial situation and the 
reason I for any short.ales, 
according to Yeager . 

Because the system is 
structured to allow individual' 
determinations of need and 
allocations of priorities, the 
burden of dealing with the 
Iranians' problem falls on 
individual campuses. 

San Diego has less policy to 
deal with the situation than any 
campus contacted, probably 
because it has the smallest 
population of Iranian students, 
(36) . 

"In general, it's a non-issue 
here," Fred Hessinger, UCSD 
Deputy Director of Financial 
Aid said. 

By contrast. UC Davi~ . with 
over 120 Iranian students and 
an established foreign student 
program, responded with 
registration fee deferrals , 
(standard among the campuses 
with larger Iranian student 
populations) . 

Decisions there were made in 
conference of the Vice 
Chancellors over how much of 
the financial aid money, which 
might otherwise go to 
Americans, should be allocated 
·to the visitors, according to 
Ronald Johnson, UCD assistant 

director of counseling for 
financial aid . 

At Davis, living expense as 
well as tuition and fees may be 
provided by loan or even 
.ranta. At Berlteley (111 
Iraniana) eme ... ency loans are 
available, as they are at Irvine 
(59 Iranians" Santa Barbara 
(71), and Los Angelea (330). 

And at San Dlqo, where 
Iranian student. complained of 
the lack of such arrangements, 
there apparently has been no 
demand. The result is 
confusion. 

The students were not clear 
on exactly what was available, 
and Hessinger said the problem 
had not even come up in the 
Financial Aids orrice. 

"If it had. I wold have heard 
about it," he said. Individual 
>!ases have apparently been 
worked out between Walsh, the 
students. and the Registrar's 
Office, where a few students 
were allowed to enroll in 
c1a!;ses without paying fees a 
the time pC registration , 
according to Hessinger and · 
Walsh. 

Although the students resent 
it , the lack of policies
