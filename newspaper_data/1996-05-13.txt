Arbor Police stepped up 
security on the final day of 
classes at the University of

concerns over the annual

Leech said the possibility of a 
student being hit and injured 
by a car is increa ed because 
of the widespread consump-
tion of alcohol at the unautho-
rized event. Led by 
Michigan's crew team, 
hundreds of tudents brave

Holocaust Survivor Discusses Life In 
Nazi-Era Poland, Concentration Camps 
LECTURE: David Faber's book 
is used in 'Making of the 
Modem World' classes 
By M.rI ...... VIllI 
Senior Staff Writer 

More than 200 students and faculty members 
gathered to hear the tragic and inspiring story of 
Holocaust survivor David Faber Thursday night 
in Peterson Hall. The lecture, called "Sharing the 
Spirit of Survival," gave the audience an intimate 
look at the harrowing conditions Jews faced in 
Nazi-controlled Poland. 

A local San Diego resident and grandfather of 
a UCSO student, Faber has shared his life story 
with thollsands of students at schools and lectures 
across the nation. His book, entitled BecQlUt of 
Romelc, chronicles his experiences and is used in 
UCSO's "Making of the Modem World" sequence 

at Roosevelt College. 
Faber, who survived internment at eight con-

centration camps, was only 13 years old when 
World War n began. He said that when the Ger-
mans first invaded Poland in 1939, entire build-
ings were festooned with Nazi flags. Yel, Faber 
said the worst part were the signs that came to 
hang in doorways throughout the city that read 
"Jews are forbidden to enter." 

The Faber family soon moved to Tarnow, 
Poland, trying to escape persecution by the Ger-
mans. The family had no money, so they were 
forced to move in with Faber's aunt and uncle. 

With a light tremble in his voice, Faber re-
counted how one day he was left behind in the 
house when other members of his fami ly went out 
in search of work. As his uncle's f ami Iy ate lunch, 
Nazis burst into the house. 

"They shot my uncle and aunt and cousins.

Student Cars 
Targeted in 
Crime Spree 
WAVE: Auto thefts and 
burglaries are down overall, 
except in Warren lots 
By An.nd Patel 
Staff Writer 

Students parking at Warren College have 
lost over $45,000 in a recent outbreak of 
auro thefts and burglaries, according to 
UCSD police reports. 

The UCSD police have recorded 13 auto 
burglaries and three actual car thefts since 
April 27, when the crime wave i believed to 
have started. 

According to UCSD Police Sergeant Bob 
Jone , the perpetrators are most likely one 
group "that has seen the opportunity that 
UCSD present ... and they are taking advan-
tage of the fact that studcnts park their cars 
and leave them for day ." 

Jones raised the possibility of a stakeout, 
saying the UCSD police have engaged in 
stakeouts in the pa t, but that the effort 
required of UCSD's 27 sworn police offic-
ers would "stretch us to our limits."

auto thefts and burglaries, 1995-96

Although the activity has so far been 
confined mostly to the Warren parking lots, 
Jones said he believes the criminals will 
probably move to other lots around campu . 

"What we have to do is anticipate where 
they are going to go next," he said. "They 
will eventually be caught, arrested and 
thrown in jail" 

Jones added that the UCSD police will 
continue to investigate the thefts and bur-
glaries already committed. 

Jones said stolen vehicles are generally 
taken either to Mexico or to a "chop shop," 
where the car are disassembled for parts. 
Jones said the type of car stolen gives the 
police an idea of it final de tination -
Acuras are often sent to chop shops, while 
vans go to Mexico. 

While auto theft and burglary cases are 
generally transferred to the San Diego Police 
Department - with its Regional Anti-Theft

rights, saying that "revealing my 
source would be to betray myself, 
my career, my life." 

Meanwhile, on that same Sep-
tember day in 1916, in a decision 
which in hindsight would later 
benefit Schorr, PBS decided it 
would broadcast the House Ethics 
Commitlee hearing live. 

While questioning by the com-
mittee during the morning session 
had been harsh, in the afternoon, 
"something happened." 

"The tone of the questioning 
changed," Schorr recalled. "With 
certain questions, they gave me an 
opportunity to set myself in a 
slightly more favorable light." 

During the hearing, PBS affili-
ates across the country began to 
receive phone calls from viewers 
who were concemed by the hear-
ings. 

"[The House Committee mem-
bers] were surprised that this re-
porter, who hid more or less been

there," Schorr said. "With a result

Schorr said. 'This is a profession I

the profession evolve and emerge 
and have seen things which have 
left me unhappy." 

" 'n my years in journalism, I 
was trying simply to illuminate the 
world a little bit for people who are 
badly in need of illumination," he 
added. 

The bulk of Schorr's criticism 
focused on how professional jour-
nalism has evolved into an enter-
tainment industry to which few 
people can truly relate. 

"In the 20 years since [his ques-
tioning by the House Ethics Com-
mittee], the sympathy with report-
ers is gone," Schorr said. "It's not 
the 'press' anymore, it's called the 
'media.'" 

"I have always found it very 
interesting that when you talk about 
'the powerofthc press,' it is kind of 
an upbeat [term]," he added. "But

UCSD Hosts Annual California Biotechnology Conference 
COPYRIGHT: 
Panelists discuss 
international patent Jaw 
By Trlcla Ebey 
Guardian Reporter 

Possible policy change at the 
Food and Drug Admini strat ion 
(FDA) and inte llectual-property 
law reform were the main topics 
of di scussion at the 12th-annu al 
Cali fo rnia Biotechnology Confer-
ence, held at UCSD last Thursday. 

Hosted by UCSD's Center fo r 
Molecular Genet ic and the Mary-
land Bioscience Alli ance - which 
participated via teleconFerence-
the discussion featured a panel of 
experts on various topics related 
to worldwide bi otec hnology 
policy. 

Bruce Lehman, assistant secre-
tary of commerce and commis-
sioner of patents and trademarks 
at the U.S. Department of Com-
merce, highlighted some key bio-
technology-property issues. 

"You often don ' t know a phar-
maceutical or biological invention 

is useful until you 've gone all the 
way through the human testing pro-
cess ... [which] can take five to six 
years," Lehman said before a group 
composed pri marily of research-
ers and patent lawyers. "nt 's] a 
completely unworkable situation, 
since if you publish your results 
and you don ' t file a palent appli-
cation within 12 months, it goes 
into public domain and you would 
never get to patent your work. That 
obviously wa not the intent ofthe 
law." 

Lehman discussed some of the 
difficu hies hi office has e ncoun-
tered recently with human-ge-
nome-sequ enci ng patent 
applications. These appli cations 
oft en tie up the patent office to the 
extent that it cannot process other 
requests. Patent officials have di s-
~ussed the problem and have made 
seve ral reco mmendat ions, al-
though no new procedures arc in 
place yet. 

Lehman also di scussed hi s 
office's responsibilities, which in-
clude ensuring that the United 
States has a regulatory and legal 

"w. cannot have our 
people subsidize

r .... rch for the rest

framework in place that puts the 
American research community in 
the most competitive global posi-
tion possible. 

"We cannot have our people

of this asset in intemat ionaltrade," 
Lehman said . "[Other countries] 
have to meet us halfway. " 

Lehman spoke of the European 
Economic Community's (EEC) re-
luctance to allow the patenting of 
li ve organisms. The fi rst li ving 
invent ion, a single-celled organ-
ism, was patented in the United 
States in 1980. 

Lehman said he believes the 
European Patent Office's resis-
tance is based on misconception 
about possib Ie abuses of t he patent 
process. 

"We are not intendi ng to make 
slaves of a particular group of 
people whose genetic material may 
have been used in research," 
Lehman said. "All we are propos-
ing to do is do what we have done 
always, and that is to provide for 
novel and non-obvious innovation 
which has never before existed." 

Both the United States and the 
EEC prohib it patenting actual hu-
mans. 

Lehman said the patenting of 
Ii ve organisms would allow scien-
ti sts to recoup the time and money 

spent developing the organisms. 
According to Lehman, scien-

tific innovation will be tined if 
the EEC does not allow li ve or-
ganisms to be patented. 

Later in the meeti ng, Greg 
Simon, a domestic po licy advisor 
to Vice President Al Gore, high-
lighted the administration's con-
cerns about fu ture biotechnology 
legislation. 

Speaki ng from Maryland via 
teleconference, Simon a ked at -
tendee how they would address 
concerns the bio technology indus-
try has about FDA review and ap-
proval of foreign and domeSlic 
biotechnology products. 

"Many of those review ti mes 
are less than the times that are 
listed in the Drug User Act, which 
was a compromise reached be-
tween the government and indus-
try ," Simon said. "We also don't 
believe that if a foreign govern-
ment approves a drug, that drug 
automatically goes to the head of 
the line. That 's a dangerous way 
to set prioriti es."

PINI . N 
SHOULD T~E UNITED STATES BE THE 

Military Presence Is 
Still Necessary in 

Post-Cold War Era 
By Derek yan Hoften 
Co{)pinion Editor 

Pat Buchanan would have you believe that the 
United States' best approach to foreign policy i an 
isolationist philosophy that ignores the world market. 
The political left would have you believe that since 
the Cold War is over, no potential military conflicts 
appear imminent for the United States. Both sides 
use their arguments to push for a massive decrease 
in Ihe u .S. military 's presence overseas. But both 
sides ignore the realities of the modem 
international environment. 

Even the most 
basic history 
class teaches 
us that a 
country'. 
domestic 
prosperity can 
only be Insured 
by strong 
protection. 

QuilJ! simply, military 
threats still exist in all 
parts of the world. The 
demise of the Soviet 
Union does not 
automatically guarantee a 
democratic, peace-loving 
Eastern Europe. While some 
countries - such as the 
Czech Republic - have had 
successful experiences with 
democracy, others - such as 
Russia -. have suffered 
dramatically since 199 I . This 
post-Cold War chaos, along 
with a healthy dose of ardent 

jingoism, has sparked significant movements for a 
return to communist rule. 

But far more indicative of the remainingÂ· threat to 
the United States, Russia has not reduced its spending 
on offensive military capabilities since 1991. The 
Russians have continued to build attack submarines 
and air-force jet~. While military production docs not 
necessarily imply immediate conflict, past history 
does show that Russia and the United States have 
frequently had competing interests, which are most 
often settled by one's military. The simple lesson is 
that we cannot afford to lay down our arms in an 
idealistic hope that peace has arrived. 

At the same time, various other overseas mi litary 
threats warrant an active U.S. military. Beyond the 
more obvious global powers, smaller countries pose 
perhaps a greater threat to U.S. and international 
security. Countries like North Korea, Iran and Libya, 
which have continued to work towards developing 
nuclear weapons, have also demonstrated a disregard 
for peace. It is more likely that a smaller 
counlry with a hislory of lerrorist

He's past his prime. He's no longer protecting

call it quits - if not for the good of the country,

American citizens just don ' t care about foreign 
problems, particularly when they are victims of 

domestic injustices. 
The barometer of U.S. 

belligerence abroad - and 
lack of vigilance at home -
has always been the U.S. 
military. So before America 
can discard this inane idea of 
being the "world 's 
policeman," it must start with 
the bombs and the barracks. 
First; the United States should 
cut back on its military forces, 
which would ultimately boost 
America's economy. Second, 
it should stop wasting money 
on the Department of Defense 
that could be beller spent in 
crucial domestic areas, such

his nose out of all but the most serious of foreign 
affairs, at least until problems in his own backyard are 
rectified. 

Only when these steps are taken will the United 
States will be able to assume the role of the world's 
mediator and protector. As it is .now, America simply 
looks hypocritical and stupid. It wags its finger at all 
the little third-world "kids," while failing to live up to 

the "adult" standards it so proudly champions.

COMMENTARY: Noisy rallies and annoying petitioners make lunch in the Price Center hardly satisfying 

No SUCH THING AS A HASSLE-FREE LUNCH 
By ChrIs SC ...... 
Staff Writer 

It's noon, and I'm hungry. Not 
just a lillie bit hungry, but really 
famished. I've just gottenÂ· out of 
another long, pointless lecture in a 
steamy, overpopulated room given 
by a professor with the personaIity 
of a pile of paint chips. The only 
thing that kept me going throughout 
the lecture was the thought that 
when he was finished droning, I was 
going 10 gel lunch. 

I'm on my way over to the Price 
Center to grab some grub when I'm 
accosted by at least three separate 
people aslcing me to sign political 
petitions for silly causes like "Save 
the spotted banana slug" or "Stop 
politicians from being political" or 
other such tripe. I'm hungry - I just 
want food. I tell them that banana 
slugs are particularly tasty fried in 
garlic with drawn buuer, and that my 
future career plans have me working 
in political fundraising selling my 
services to the highest bidder. 
Finally, they stop accost.ing me.

1 hurry down the stairs by the 
fountain and am greeted by people 
who love me so dearly that they 
want to expand my financial 
horizons by signing me up for credit 
cards that will give me instant access 
to money [ do flO( have, at only 9.9 
percent for the first 3 days, and 50 
percent compounded daily after thaI. 
And, if I promise to be at least 
$5,000 in debt by the first month, 
they promise me a free T-shil1. Oh 
joy, ohjoy. 

After trying to gnaw off my own 
arm, partly from hunger but mostly 
to escape from the evi I credit trap, I 
move on to the next stage of the 
game. Right past those credit fiends 
are the tables of various student 
organizations that are vying for my 
attenlion. The Northern Burmese 
Laotian Student Organization is 
trying to solicit signatures for a 
petition to free TIbet, and a member 
of some health organization is 
chasing me with handfuls of free 
condoms in assorted colors and 
states of lubrication. I'm so hungry

alone to enjoy a

might have actually stopped.

through the masses to get out ide 
and look for a place to sit. 

On my way out the door, I pass 
by two aerobics girls and their lillie 
Richard Simmons-wannabe friend. 
They look disdainfully on my 
sodium-rich tray of tasty treats. One 
of them asks me if I know that red 
meat just sits in one's stomach 
forever and never digests, while the 
other spandex-clad girl starts a tirade 
about the cruel conditions in which 
the poor cows have to live before 
becoming meat patties. 1 politely 
"moo" at both of them, and say that 
lhis particular cow's name was 
Betsy, and she lived happily as some 
boy's pet before he needed money 
for a new Power Ranger play station 
and sold her to become my burger. 

DAM MIT ! I WANT TO EAT! 
Because there are no empty 

tables outside, I go over to the steps 
and sit down. I am about to begin 
eating when some obnoxious, high-
pitched whining fills the whole area. 

Oh, no - another A.S.-

sponsored rally against the evil 
white male. Why can't they just go 
pass another oh-so-useful and 
pel1inent resolution voicing their 
opposition to child prostitution in 
East Asia (as if we had a large group 
of supponers of child prostitution 
on campus from whom they wished 
to distinguish themselves) and let 
me eat my lunch in peace? Why has 
lunchtime become a forum for 
everyone to foist their inane 
political views on poor, hungry 
passers-by? Is it too much to ask to 
be left alone to enjoy a tasty burger 
and fries? If I wanted to hear about 
knee-jerk political ideas, 1 couldÂ· eat 
at the Che. 

I relreat back up the stairs with 
my food in hand, and I finally find a 
place to eat in the Library Lounge, 
where I can ignore the rally. Ahh. 
This will be good. 1 take my first bite 
into my burger, and by this lime it's 
all soggy and my fries are cold. To 
top it off, I forgot to get ketchup. 1 
think tomorrow I will bring my own 
lunch.

acti vities, like Iran, would be less 
hesitant to "push the button." 

Moving back to the larger 
world powers, let us also not forget 
China's recent foray with Taiwan, 
which shows quite clearly that the 
Chinese government has little 
regard for international law or 
treaties. This unpleasant reality 
becomes even more foreboding 
when one examines China's future 
military capabilities. With a decade 
of constant growth behind it, 
China's economy is expected to 
match those of Japan and the 
United States by the early 21 st 
century. Such growth would allow 
China to develop a military to 
match - and consideri ng its 
recent history of stubbornness and 
bravado, that is definitely a 
concern for the United States. 

A powerful China threatens 
U.S. interests primarily because it 
threatens Asian security, the new

without the draft, America has an 
overabundance of enlisted men and 
women. The Pentagon has already 
tried to get rid of soldiers and 
sailors. Il has been instituting early 
retirement plans for older 
servicemen, trimming the number 
of ROTC scholarships from over 
2,000 to just under 800 and 
toughening the standards for entry 
into the armed forces. 

While the Pentagon's efforts are 
wholly appropriate, it should go 
even funher. The Army and the 
Marines have many of the same 
functions and could be 
consolidated. A merger would be 
painless - with the main cuts 
taking place at the depanmental 
levet. In addition, the Air Force has

years, as Navy jets and amphibious 
strike teams do all the work in 
regional conflicts. And why not trim

large-scale attacks has been phased 

center of American overseas trade. 
Never mind Canada and Mexico, or 
even Europe for that matter. Asia's 
economy has grown remarkably 
over the last 20 years, thanks to the 
strong presence of the U.S. 
military. And this brings up the 
second main argument for the U.S. 
military to "police the world": It 
protects our interests by protecting 
our economy. 

Everyone knows the importance 
of the Japanese markets. But few 
people know that it has been the 
U.S. military's continued presence 
in Japan since World War n which 
has allowed Japan to prosper. In 
fact, a strong U.S. force in all of 
Southeast Asia has created an 
atmosphere of stability, which has 
fostered the economic growth of 
smaller countries such as 
Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. 
Without the U.S. military watching 
over the region, China and other 
powers would have been free to 
control the area, which would 
directly conflict with U.S. interests: 
free trade with Asia. 

Stability in Asia has prevented 
what would have otherwise been an 

out in this age of mini-conflicts. 
There is no genuine need for a 

U.S. military of its current size. The 
Cold War is over. It's not a matter of 
jobs - it's a matter of jobs that add 
to the U.S. economy. Employing 
people to fight a non-existent enemy 
does nothing to aid the United 
States' fiscal growth. The same logic 
applies to wonhless military bases 
- favorite pork-barrel projects of 
politicians. Many of these bases are 
falling apart. Many more sit on 
prime land and could be converted 
into public parks or schools, or sold 
to private entities. 

Interestingly, studies have shown 
that the current military cut-backs 
have actually helped the U.S . 
economy. The RAND corporation, 
an independent consulting firm, 
found that from 1989 to 1994, the 
cities with base closures showed 
equal or greater growth than those 
which did not have closures. In 
addition, RAND found that 
employees working in the aerospace 
and other military-related industries 
also benefited from the cutbacks. 
Over 42 percent of defense workers 
are still employed, 30 percent have 
found jobs elsewhere, three percent 
are unemployed and 7.3 percent

inevitable arms race in that region, 
an event which would threaten the 
stability of the entire globe. The 
Demilitarized Zone has been a 
source of potential conflict since 
the Korean War; a U.S. presence 
there has helped stabilize a 
potentially volati Ie area and has 
allowed the region's economy to 
grow, thereby providing more 
market for American goods. 

Efforts to equate a U.S. presence 
abroad with imperialism have no 
basis. One has only to observe the 
recent decisions of U.S. military 
bases in the Philippines and 
Okinawa. When the govemrnents of 
those nations ordered the United 
States to leave, we left. Despite the 
frequent. but misguided, protests by 
students and radicals in those 
countries demanding the departure 
of the U.S. military, most citizens, 
including the individual 
governments, favor a U.S. presence. 
They recognize its importance for 
their own prosperity. 

Often, opponents of an a.ctive 
and panicipating U.S. military 
argue that the United States has no 
business intruding in other 

have garnered a raise in salaries. 
This is not surprising, considering 
they are now doing work actually 
needed in the free market. 

Scaling back the U.S. military is 
one way to begin to eliminate the 
notion of America as the "world's 
policeman." But perhaps the most 
important way to do so is 10 stop the 
flow of money from its source -
namely, from the U.S. Depanment 
of Defense. The United States has 
allotted $254.4 billion for defense 
spending in 1997, in accordance 
with Pentagon recommendations. 
But the freewheeling Republican-
controlled House and Senate voted 
last week to tack on an additional 
$13 billion more to that total. This 
would bring spending up to nearly 
Cold War levels. 

Of course, this is nothing new 
for the Depanment of Defense. 
President Eisenhower long ago 
recognized the existence of a 
"military industrial complex," a 
monster that feeds itself and fuels 
the notion that America needs to 
have enough weapons to defeat 
everyone on the planet. A closer 
look at the numbers shows how 
much of this spending is wasted: 
Over half of the money, according

countries' affairs. But it is 
imponant here to differentiate 
between a simple presence, which 
maintains peace and stability, and 
an invasion into a country to 
disrupt its private policies' and 
affairs. Left-wing "human-rights" 
endeavors are much closer to 
imperialism than simply patrolling 
the coast of Taiwan. 

After all, they require an 
intervention into a country's 
system of government and a 
demand that they conform to our 
system of morals. 

While it is noble to feel for 
oppressed peoples in other parts of 
the world, it is not reasonable to 
expect the United States to solve 
their problems every time. When 
internal conHicts begin to threaten 
the United States' security or 
interests, intervention becomes an 
option, but a reluctant one at that. 

In addition, both sides of the 
political spectrum love to point out 
the endless list of domestic 
problems left unattended, while we 
spend billions on foreign countries. 
But they fail to recognize that U.S. 
foreign policy is what allows 

to a recent congressional report, is 
going 10 weapons on the verge of 
being phased out. Much of the 
spending, which makes up an 
astounding 22 percent of the U.S. 
budget, goes to projects like the 
billion-dollar "Star Wars" failure 
and the $2 bittion Seawolf 
submarine, a boat that doesn ' t float. 

In fact, there's so much waste in 
the Defense Department that even 
its own officials don 't know where 
the money is going. On April 28, 
1996, the Associated Press reported 
that $11.2 million of Defense 
Department funds is currently sent 
to the Vietnamese government, in 
order to aid the search of U.S. 
POW's from the Vietnam War. Over 
one-third of the money is still 
unaccounted for. Of course, all this 
wasteful spending covers up the 
fact that America could spend a lot 
more on domestic projects. 

This brings me to my final point: 
If the United States would just give 
one-founh of what it is spending on 
the military to Â¢ucation, everyone 
in the country would benefit. Why 
not liquidate the failed "Star Wars" 
program and try to inject some cash 
into projects that are huning at 
home, like Social Security or

domestic life to exist. A stable Asia 
means a-betler American economy. 
And a careful check on foreign 
powers means freedom at home. 
Cenainly, there are problems 
within the United States' own 
borders, but they would be far 
worse without our military's effons 
abroad. 

We simply cannot afford to cut 
back on military spending; it 
should be our country's No. I 
priority. If we are in serious debt, 
we should cut back elsewhere. The 
government cannot be eltpected to 
legislate away all the country's 
domestic ills. But it has to be 
expected to defend its citizens 
while they shape society at home. 

It is nothing more than irrational 
idealism which leads people to 
shout such slogans as "Farms, not 
arms." Even the most basic history 
class teaches us that a country's 
domestic prosperity can only be 
insured by strong protection. While 
we would all love a world where 
we can afford to cut back on 
military spending and bask in 
permanent peace, the rest of the 
world is not always willing. 

Medicare? The government's first 
responsibility should be to its own 
people, not to other countries (and 
often corporate special interests). 
Within our own boundaries, there 
are the homeless, the perpetually 
poor and the talented who are 
unable to afford higher education -
all of whom are ignored in favor of 
a billion-dollar armed-forces branch 
that is never used. 

The United States simply does 
not need to be the "world's 
policeman" anymore. Look back at 
recent conflicts m which America 
has taken pan: Vietnam, Grenada, 
Libya, Panama, the Persian Gulf 
and Bosnia. What has the United 
States done to change these 
conflicts in the long run? Nothing. 
And while the United States should 
be ready to address such horrible 
events as WWII and the Holocaust 
in the future, it has shown great 
ability to mobilize capital and 
resources quickly enough to make 
a substantial impact in any war that 
might arise. 

People are dying within our 
own borders, and it'~ time for 
Uncle Sam to hang up his hal. His 
days as the "world's policeman" 
are over.

MURDERS: 
Saitoh's colleagues 
spoke highly of him 
Continued from pace 1 
the exact details of the murders are 
still unclear. 

"It 's a complete m'ystery," 
Breitenstein said. 

The motive behind the 
shootings remains'Unknown. Noth-
ing was taken from the Saitohs, 
their car or their home. 

Saitoh's colleagues said the sci-
entist had been at his lab that 
evening, helping his daughter with 
a school project. 

"It appears from what we know 
now that the doctor and his daughter 
left lhe lab sometime around 10p.m. 
to 10: 15 p.m.," Breitenstein said. 
"They drove home- we don ' t know 
if they made any stops along the 
way - and when they drove into the 
driveway, an unknown assailant 
began shooting at the car." 

Interim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio expressed her concern over 
the shootings and spoke highly of 
Saitoh and his work. 

''I'm deeply shocked at what 
has happened," Caserio said. "It's 
such a loss for the campus to see 
somebody of his accomplishments 
snuffed out this way."

Shizue, who had been vacationing 
in France, arrived Friday in San

pear at a press conference with 
members of the Japanese Consu-
late, but she was too shaken to 
speak after viewing her husband 
and daughter'S bodies at the county 
Medical Ex.aminer's Office.

Saitoh and his colleagues also 
showed that a small protein, called 
sAPP, was involved in brain 
growth and survival. They dem-
onstrated in animal studies that it 
improved cognitive function and 
reversed paralysis caused by 
strokes. 

"He was a leading scientist in 
the field of Alzheimer' s disease, a 
superb mentor and a wonderful 
colleague," UCSD Neurosciences 
Chair Leon Thai said . 

Saitoh's colleagues and stu-
dents spoke highly of him.

SURVIVOR: 
Faber takes his story 
around the country 
Continued from pace 1 
Helen [Faber's cousin's fiancee] fell 
on lop of me and was my shield. She 
took many bullets," he said. 

When his family returned, they 
abandoned the house immediately 
and sought refuge in an empty ware-
house on the outskirts of town. Sev-
eral weeks later, Faber's eldest 
brother was reunited with the fam-
ily after escaping from a Russian 
prisoner-of-war camp. 

Faber said his brother was the 
only member of the family who had 
an idea of what the future held for 
the Jews of Poland. He warned them 
that they might soon be sent to a 
concentration camp, a concept which 
was still forcign to the family mem-
bers. 

''' What is a concentration 
camp?'" Faber recalled asking. "We 
were so ignorant." 

Faber's family members con-
cealed themselves in a three-foot 
crawl space within the walls of the 
warehouse and watched through 
cracks as Nazi officers threw their 
Jewish neighbors from windows and 
shot them in the street. 

Faber said it was the Polish 
people who reported their Jewish 
neighbors to the Nazis. 

"['ve come to teach you," he 
said. "Hate brings destruction to this 
world." 

When his family came out of 
seclusion to search for food, they 
were sent to a Jewish ghetto -
where they again found a hiding 
place in the walls of their new home. 
Though they successfully eluded the 
Nazis in several raids, Faber's fa-
ther was shot one day as he ran on 
the roof to hide. Ten days later, the 
Nazis returned and shot his sister 
and mother, as Faber lay hidden 
under a couch. 

Faber and his brother were then 
taken to Gestapo headquarters to be 
questioned. Faber's elder brother 
was tortured to death, and Faber was 
beaten and left in the street for dead. 

After being taken in by a Jewish 
family and nursed back to health, 
Faber was sent to the first of eight 
concentration camps. He received 
his hated identi fication tattoo, carved 
in his skin with a nail dipped in ink. 

He then became one of many 
Jews charged with the gruesome 
task of checking the mouths of the 
dead for gold fillings . 

He added that in Bilkenau, the 
sheer number of transpons of Jews 
prevented the Nazis from .killing 
them all with gas. 

"So they poured gasoline over 
the men, women and children as 
they stood in a huge ditch and sct 
them all. on fire. The screams of 
these people I will never forget. 
How cruel can people beT Faber 
said, fighting back tears. 

When the Allies finally carne and 
liberated the camps, Faber was 19 
yeaJ1i old and weighed a mere 72 
pounds. He said it took him more than 
a year to recuperate, and he suffers 
lingering health problems to this day. 

Faber later came to learn that his 
elder brother Romek had been part 
of an underground organization, 
comprised of thousands of people 
throughout Europe who were work-
in, to slop Germany from impon-
in, heavy water to build nuclear 
we.pons.

brocher, Fiber bepn to record his

CRIMES: Police 
strongly recommend 
anti-theft measures 
Continued from Pille 1 
Team - Jones said the vehicle's li-
cense plate and identi fication num-
bers are added to a national computer 
database in theft caSes. . 

Through this database, law-en-
forcement officials 

mining burglary to a vehicle in one of 
our parking lots, we will also follow 
thai up with a search warrant for the 
person's house," Jones said. "What 
we typically find is other stolen pr0p-
erty, and so we close other cases." 

Jones said that in long-term park-
ing lots it is often difficult to deter-
mine when the burglaries and thefts 
occurred, malcing police investiga-
tions even more difficult. 

Warren fresh-
can look up thesta- ". have a cut4ut man Thomas 

Zuingman, whose 
CD player and 
spealcers were sto-
len, told the police 
hi s car was brolc.en 
into sometime be-
tween April 28 and 
May 3. Zuingman 
said the burglar 
punched in the 
keyhole on his 
car's door. 

IUS of any vehicle 
they believe might 
be stolen. 

"JUSltwoweeks 
ago, we had a car 
which was origi-
nally stolen two 
years ago that was 
identified in Belize, 
Central America," 
Jones said.

are put into databases. Jones said 
the items occasionally end up in 
pawn shops around the county. 

Jones said the UCSD police, San 
Diego Sheriffs Office and San Di-
ego Police Depanment often coor-
dinate with one another to investi -
gate the crimes, which often overlap 
into different jurisdictions.

Jones said this 
technique, cal led a 
"door-punch," is a 
common way auto 
thieves break into 

a car. He added that thieves also com-
monly slip "slim-jims" between the 
car's door and its window to open the 
lock. Jones said both techniques can 
be carried out in Ie than a minute. 

According to Marshall sopho-
more Geoffrey Dezereaux, the bur-
glars who stole his stereo system 
between May I and May 3 used a 
"door-punch" to break into his car. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Dezereaux said that although he 
did not have an alarm system at the 
time, he will definitely get one now. 

Jones said he believes the best 
way to combat these crimes is 
through prevention, and that car 
owners should focus on "target hard-
ening" - making it more difficult 
for burglars to get at what they want. 

"If you have an expensive ste-
reo, lock it in the trunk or take it with 
you," Jones said. "It will never get 
stolen if you have it with you." 

Jones added that it is useful to 
not only have an alarm, but to also 
have some kind of sign to warn the 
burglar of the alarm's existence. 

Warren fresl,man Antonio Lemos 
said his truck's alarm did not prevent 
thieves stealing it from lot 510. 

According to Jones, successful 
theft preventi6n requires more than 
just an alarm. He advises car owners 
to also use appropriate steering-
wheel locking devices, such as The 
Club. Jones warned, however, that 
some devices can be defeated by 
cutting the steering wheel. 

'They have locking device now 
that lock onto the steering wheel in 
such a fashion that they cannot be 
removed even if the steering wheel is 
cut," he said. 'That's the type you 
want to buy." 

Jones added that he believes the 
best anti-theft device is the cut-out 
switch, which prevents the vehicle 
from even being started. 

" have a cut-out switch on my 
own car, and [defy you to find it inside

Below is a comparison of the number of auto thefts and 
burglaries that occurred between January 1 and May 10.

of 30 minutes," he said. 'There is no 
thief who is going to sit there for 30 
minutes trying to steal my car." 

While some students say they 
believe that measures aimed at pre-
vention will deter auto thefts and 
burglaries, others believe lot secu-
rity should be improved. 

According to Jones , campus 
parking lots are currently patrolled 
by uniformed police officers, shuttle 
drivers and campu security offic-
ers during the day, and residential 
security officers during the night. 

Dezereaux believeslhat wliilecon-
stant surveillance is impossible, there 
still should be increased security.

Revelle sophomore Kevin 

Destro, whose CD changer was sto-
len from his car sometime between 
April 28 and May 2, questioned the 
use of security to deter auto crimes. 

"Half the time (lot patrollers] are 
looking to give tickets to make 
money off of us, instead of protect-
ing the goods that we have," he said. 

Warren freshman Evan 
Huckabay, whose CD changer was 
stolen sometime between April 29 
and May 2, said he agreed parking at 
UCSD is Â·'definitely unsafe." He 
added that after his car ~as broken 
into twice, he decided the best pre-
vention was to leave it at home.

BIOTECH: 
Drug makers seek to 
rush approval process 
Continued from pace 3 

Simon added that his office is 
not afraid to criticize the FDA. 

" We are asked by the 'public to 
protect them from Ihings. and if 
there is ever a clear function of 
government, it's at the FDA to 
make sure that the foods and drugs 
and devices are safe," he said_ 

"This isn ' t just a case of ' We 
don't have time to do it right the 
first time.' This is a case of 'We 
cannot afford not to do it right the 
first time ... â¢ 

According to Simon, a U _S. 
Senate bill on drug-approval re-
form is out of committee and ready 
to go to the Senate nOOL 

" We only have three or four 
more weeks until things really get 
si lly," he said. "The president said 
we only need 30 or 40 days, and 
then we can let Sen. Dole and oth-
ers do all their symbolic gestures." 

Floyd Bloom, editor of Science 
magazine, expressed the research 
community 's frustration in getting 
funding and strongly applauded 
UCSD CONNECT - the program 
designed 10 foster connections be-
tween scientists and industry. 

Bloom emphasized that while 
corporafe sponsorship is often 
viewed as a necessary evil, most 
of the funds from these sources go 
into the development of research 
technologies rather than the re-
search itself. 

"I don't think that knowledge 
is a commodity that supply and 
demand should determi ne its 
value," Bloom said. 

CONNECT founder Bill 
Otterson, current director of. the 
program, received the 1996 Price 
Waterhouse Award at the conferÂ· 
ence in recognition of his service 
to the biotechnology community. 

Price Waterhouse Di rector 
Tony Altig said Otterson has 
shown an incredible amount of 
energy and ingenuity in bringing

SCHORR: 
Journalist blasts 
tabloid television 
Continued from page 2 
when we say, ' power of the me-
dia,' it has a very negative connoÂ· 
tation _" 

Schorr placed some of the 
blame for the deterioration o f pro -
fessional journalism on television 
show s like " Hard Copy," 
" Geraldo" and "America 's Most 
Wanted" - programs which he 
said constitute an " assault on real -
ity ." 

"They call themselves rea l i ty-
based programming," he said. "1 
call it reality -debased program-
ming." 

According to Schorr, journal-
ism has become so enveloped in 
the entertainment industry that 
people no longer view journalists 
as the purveyors of reality. 

"I think that we, in the press, 
Iutve some making up to do with 
the American people_ We have to 
convince them all over again ... to 
care about the press," Schorr said. 

"(think we can ,ct back there 
by civic journalism." he added. 
"Being a journalist is a wonderful 
thinl .... . would like to continue to 
enjoy it, and â¢ would likc you to 
foraive me my press pass."

CCAAs: Tritons 
final qualifying chance 
ContInued from pac. 20 
forward included Angie Allen (PR 
in javelin) and Christi Norton (PRs 
in shot put and discus). Undoubl-
ed1y, the hardest points of the two-
day meet for UCSD were earned by 
senior Derek Bennett, who decided 
to put his body through the ullimale 
test of track-and-field versatility and 
endurance: the decathlon. 

". must have drunk I 0 gallons of 
waler, but it was a blast," Bennett 
said. "All of the guys bonded in-
stantly because we knew we were 
going to put ourselves through hell ." 

Amid the blistering heat, 

The UCSD Guardian 

Bennett and company were put 
through their paces in five events 
each day, and the Triton competi-
tor emerged with a second-place 
finish. His total score was short of 
automatic NCAA-qualifying stan-
dards, but it will be sent in for 
consideration nonetheless. 

Just as Benneu moved from the 
track to the field with ease, so too 
did Lisa Shepard, who continued to 
run and jump as if unaffected by her 
recent surgery. Shepard broke the 
school record in the triple jump, 
bounding to a distance of 38'7.5" to 
improve on her NCAA-qualifying 
mark, while finishing third. 

Shepard earned a second-place 
mark with a PR in the long jump, 
and highlighted her meet with a first-

place in the 100 hurdles, storming 
home in 14.4 seconds. 

"II's a test of her as a true cpm-
petitor that she is able to deal with 
[the injury] and come back like she 
has," Van Arsdale said. 

The women's 800 meter team 
was also impressive, as a quartet 
of Tritons, led by Robyn 
Her kowitz (2: 18.05), reac;hed the 
finals. Herskowitz'timeeamedher 
sec;ond, followed dosely by Dwire, 
Courtney Gray and 'Marikka Elia 
in third, fourth and sillth, respec-
tively. 

For the UCSD men, the trac;k 
was a site for numerous Triton suc-
cesses. In the 800 meters, Goss 
Lindsey grabbed third, while team-
mates Gavin Klinger and J.J.

Castner took third and fourth, re-
spectively, in the 5,000. Castner 
returned to plac;e fi~t in the 1,500, 
with teammate Rhodes Walton 
close on his heels in third. 

When Cal Poly Pomona's Cliff 
Curtis took the early lead in the 
1,500, Castner was forced to give 
chase, running side-by-side with 
Curtis during laps two and three. 
With 250 meters to go, Castner 
moved away; and with a glance 
back at 50 meters, the di stanc;e star 
confirmed that he had the rac;e in 
hand. 

"It was good to get out and be 
pushed," Castner said. "In the 
NCAAs, I'll focus on the [5,OOOm] 
because it's been my goal to get 
back there and win [it] again." 

PREVIEW: USA, 
China put on a show 
Continued from pac. 20 
efforts, 15- 1 I. 

Team USA also failed to main-
tain a consistent level of play after 
taking the first game from China in 
the series opener at Irvine last 
Wednesday. 

"We competed hard. We just 
didn't sustain ourmomentum,"USA 
Head Coach Terry liskevych said. 
"We need to re-focus our efforts 
and play really hard each point of 
the match." 

Yet, Liskevych credited the loss 
to China's oUlstanding abilities, and 
he remains optimistic about Team 
USA 's chances in Atlanta this sum-
mer. 

"Everyone's asking us, 'What's 
wrong with you guys?'" Liskevych 
said. "What they don't realize is that 
China is playing really well. 11Iey 
don ' t lose the game: You 've got to 
beat them." 

The USA team members also 
expressed their frustration , but re-
mained confident. 

"We're disappointed because we 
know we can beat China," Cross-
Battle said. "On the other hand, we 
feel good because we played hard. 
It's not as important to win now as 
it is in July." 

The most enjoyable part of the 
evening was reserved for those 
who remained in the stands after 
the condusion of the malch, as 
many were able to talk to and ob-
tain signatures from the very same 
USA team members whose ath-
letic feats had awed them during 
the match. 

"We were really up-and-down 
tonight," Beverly Oden said, while 
handing out signatures to fans. 
"We'd challenge !hem until the last 
five points, and then just let them 
run away with it" 

However, when asked about 
Team USoA's chances in the future, 
Oden - like her reUow teammates 
and coaches - remained optimis-
tic. 

"We played better tonight than 
we did in Irvine. One of these days. 
we're going to beat 'em," she $aid. 

Unfortunately, the vic;tory 
Oden had hoped for didn't come 
last night when the two teams met 
again at Cal State San Bemardino. 
China claimed its third win of the 
series, 11-15, 15-12,6-15, 15-3, 
15-10. 

The series finale tonight at 
Eastlake High School in Chula Vista 
marks the last chance forTeam USA 
to assert itself apinst China. For 
those of you who misted the oppor-
tunity on friday. it i. abo the last 
opportunity to aeethe U.S. women's 
volleyball team in action before 
Atlanta.

PCRes Mark Season's End for UCSD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS: The Tritons sent six boats to compete at the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships 
By Den Kreft 
Sports Editor 

The Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships (PeRCs) usually 
mark the end of the road for the 

UCSD crew team. 
The National 

Championships, 
which are on the 
East Coast and 
make for an ellpen-
sive road trip, are 
rarely gi ven a 
thought out here in 

La Jolla. Last year was the first 
time in UCSD crew history that a 
boat attended the National Cham-
pionships. 

Because the chance of goi ng to 
Nationals happens only too rarely, 
the PCRCs have become a highly 
contested event. This was evident 
last weekend at Lake Natoma in 
northern California, as 31 schools 
from Oregon. Washington and 
California came together to do 
battle for West Coast supremacy.

adÂ·ver-tisÂ·1ug n 1: the 
action of calling something 
to the attention of the public, 
esp. in the UCSD Guardian 
newsplpCr, 534-3466 

... 

UCSD competed in six catego-
ries, induding five women's boats 
and one men's novice-eight hull. 

For the men's crew, it was a 
chance to build on the success of 
the city championships. The Tri-
tons did just that, finishing sol-
idly in their heat race to earn a 
berth in the petite final (pitting 
the seven through 12 heat finish-
ers against one another). 

In the petite final, the UCSD 
squad stormed to the victory, fin -
ishing ahead of its neighbor to the 
north, UC Irvine, and the Univer-
sity of Colorado. UCI and Colo-
rado crossed the finish line in 
second- and third-place, respec-
tively. 

The women's novice A boat 
was even more successful, taking 
second in its heat behind Wash-
ington State to reach the grand 
final. 

Allhough the Triton boat was 
the last across the line, placing in 
sillih at Sunday's final race, they 

were pleased to reach the final. It 
was the first time a UCSD novice 
crew had reached a grand final at 
the PCRCs. 

The women's novice B squad 
had only four boats with which to 
race against and took third, a mere 
sill-tenths of a sec;ond out of sec-
ond place, which was grabbed by 
Sacramento State. USC won the 
event, while UC Davis finished 
in fourth. 

At the varsity level, the women 
were elllremely successful, win-
ning a petite final and taking med-
als in both of the lightweight cat-
egories. 

The varsity-four boat rowed 
what UCSD Head Coach Jack 
Vallerga termed, "a superb race" 
to win the petite final. The Tri -
tons earned a benh in the final by 
virtue of their time in Ihe heat 
race, where they finished third. 

On ce there , UCSD man -
handled it oppo ition, beating 
out USC by fi ve seconds and lea v-

ing Cal Poly Pomona in third . 
The lightweight four boat was 

Ihe winner of a bronze medal, as 
il advanced tothe grand final with 
an excellent heat ti me. 

In the final, Western Wash-
ington led the pack, followed by 
Sean Ie Pacific and then the UCSD 
crew. which in tum finished ahead 
of UC Santa Barbara, Paci fic 
Lutheran and Humboldt State. 

Finally, but most notably, the 
lightweight eight crew - which 
was a collaboration between sill 
varsity rowers. a varsity coxswain 
and two novice crew members-
reached the grand final and 
grabbed an impressive second-
place finish and the silver medal. 

UCSD again was unable to get 
past the team from Western Wash-
ington, but ValJerga was ex-
tremely happy with the efforts of 
hi s thrown-together team - a 
group that had littl e opportunity 
to train together, yet gell ed at the 
ri ght time.

KENYON: 
Ousts Tritons again 
Continued from page 18 
the fourth siogles position. 

"Every match could have gone 
either way," LaPlante said. "We 
didn't lose any matches. They won 
them." 

The Tritons concluded the team 
compelition wilh a 5-4 loss to 
sillth-seed Amherst College. Due 
to the endless rain, the final match 
was played indoors, a surface un-
familiar to the UCSD squad. 

Finishing the season in sixth 
place with a 12-8 record evoked 
mixed emotions for Triton team 
members , especially the senior . 

"I think we're all pretty happy. 
We tried hard and played our best," 
Malephansakul said. "We're also 
all really sad it ' s over." 

Despite the season's anti -cli-
matic finale, the UCSD women 
retain much pride in their abilities 
and achievements. 

"We know how it feels to be at the 
top and, now, how it feels to have 
come close," Malephansakul said . 
"[Playing at UCSDI has becn a great 
chamcter-building experience."

Kenyon, Amherst Best Tritons 
OUSTED: UCSD's hopes of a national title were dashed by Kenyon 
By Robin Kezlrlan 
Staff Writer 

For the fi ve seniors on the 
UCSD women's tennis team, the 
trip to Kalamazoo College, Mich. 
forthe Division III Na-
tional Tournament re-
kindled fond memo-
ries of the national title 
they claimed there in 
1994. T he women 
wanted to go out with 
a bang and conclude 
their final season at 
UCSD with a victory. 

Repeating the 1994 perfor-
mance would be no easy task. 
T he current Triton squad, which 
has suffered through injuries and 
tough losses to top-ranked oppo-
nents, failed to earn one of the 
coveted top-four seeds. 

This left the fifth-ranked 
UCSD team at the mercy of the 
draw, and it wasn' t treated kindly . 
The Tritons drew number-one 
Kenyon College in the second 
round. Although UCSD was at 
its physical and mental peaks, 
the unfortunate draw of several 
top-ranked teams was an obstacle 
they were unable to overcome. 

"The caliber of tennis is going 
up," Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
said. "The top six teams were the 

toughe~ ever. We ' d had close 
matches with them all this sea-
son, and we played as well as we 
could at the tournament." 

UCSD had already claimed vic-
tories at the second and third 
doubles positions when number-
one Michelle Malephansakul de-
feated her Carleton counterpart, 

6-0, 6-0, for the Tri -
tons' third point. 
Hilary Somers and 
Annie Hoecker also 
won their si ngles con-
tests at the third and 
sixth positions, re -
spectively. 

The Tritons had 
already won the match by that 
point, so it was not a controversy 
when the remaining si ngl es 
matches were terminated due to 
bad weather that plagued the 
tournament from start to fin-
i sh. Whatever momentum 
the Tritons had built up with 
thei r initial victory was 
halted during their show-
down with Kenyon College 
on Wednesday. 

Although the Tritons ' 
top -seeded duo of Miki 
Kurokawa and Yumi 
Tak emoto bes ted its 
Kenyon opposition, S-5, 
Somers and Hoecker were 
defeated, S-6. After fight -
ing off two Triton match 
points, Kenyon's number-
two tandem defeated 
Malephansakul and Susan 
Huberman, 9-7, claiming 
the match advantage, 2- 1. 

Malephansakul said. "We came 
in with hi gh expectations, but we 
weren't able to pull through dur-
ing crucia l times." 

WhileMalephansakul won her 
second match of the tournament 
easi ly, 6-4, 6-4, Kurokawa and 
Somers struggled at number two 
and number three, respectively . 
Despite losing the first se t, 
Kurokawa dominated the second, 
6-1, before reli nquishing the third, 
2-6. Similarly, Somers was de-
feated by her Kenyon opponent, 
6-4, 1-6,6Â·3. Kenyon then closed 
the door on the Tritons by over-
comi ng Takemoto, 6-1, 6-2, at 

See KENYON, Page 15 

Heidi Muzhik/Guardian 

In the first round UCSD 
crushed Carleton College, 5-1. 

"[The loss) was prelly 
disappointing," 

Fuu: Triton Michelle Malephansakul 
won, but UCSD was not so fortunate.

'Dogs Bite Tritons' NCAA Hopes 
By Nicole Sunderl.nd 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
knew it was in for a knoc kdown, drag 
out fight as it headed into the Western 
Regionals last weekend. The Tritons 
topped Pomona-Pitzer on Saturday, 
5-2, but were stopped short 
of a Nationals berth by 
Redlands on Sunday, 2-5. 

The top-six Division m 
squads in the West trav-
eled to Claremont to com-
pete for only two Nation-
alsposilions. Third-ranked 
UCSD took on six th-
ranked Pomona in the fi rst round. 

In doubles competition the Tri tons 
swept the Sagehens, taking all three 
matches and gainingthedoubles point. 

"We weren't really worried about 
Pomona," said Head Coach Brian 
Turner. "We beat them fairly easi ly 
earlier in the season." 

Second seed Dan Brounstein and 
third seed Eric Steidlmayer refused to 
give Pomona the upper hand, each 
beating his respective opponent in 
two quick sets. 

While the victory over Pomona 
may have been easy, the Tritons knew 
their next contest would be the great-
est challenges of the season. 

"In the last meeting this season, 
Redlands' number-five player was 
injured," Turner said. " We knew 
they'd be a stronger team this time." 

His prophecy was fulfilled as 
Redlands gave up only three out of a 
possible nine matches. 

Top-seeded doubles duo Wilson 
and Steidlmayer pushed the Bulldogs 
to a tie-breaker, and a long return to 
Steidlmayer'sserve iced UCSD' s win, 

9-S. 
The number-two doubles tandem 

of Brounstein and Ben Becker was 
unable to stop Redlands, and the loss 
of number-three duo Shabel and Mihet 
gave the 'Dogs the early advantage. 

'"The doubles point is always im-
ponant, especially when 
playing a team like 
Redlands," Turner said. 

From that point on, the 
Tritons were unable to 
overcome the Bulldogs, 
losing four out of six 
singles matches. 

Wilson and 
Brounstein rellto Redlands in the top 
two singles positions, each losing in 
straight sets. 

In the third -seed match , 
Steidl mayer captured the victory as 
well as the point. Sixth-seeded Batra 
conquered the previously number-five 
Bulldog, 6-1, 6-4, but fourth-ranked 
Shabel fell in three sets, and Mihet 
was upended by his fifth-ranked 
Redlands opponent. This left 
Redlands with a trip to Nationals in 
Atlanta and the Tritons were left hold-
ing their bags. 

"We started slow and lost some 
c1osematches,"Tumersaid. "We were 
definitely better in the end, and that 
was our goal Unfortwlately,Redlands 
was also playing better." 

The team's season may be over, 
but there is a possibility that several 
team members may still travel to At-
lanta for Nationals. 

Their fate will be decided today at 
a regional con ference call, where eight 
singles players and four doubles teams 
wi II be selected to represent the region 
in Georgia.

Butler's Fight 
Against Cancer 

TIle general public never 
realize the impact of a seriou 
Illness until it disables someone 
perceived as invincible. It 
happened to Magic Johnson. It 
happened to the daughter of Rod 
Carew. Now it has happened 
again. 

What Magic did for AIDS 
and Carew did for the fight 
again t leukemia, Brell Butler 
wi ll now do for cancer. 

The 38-year-old Dodger 
eentertielder first entered the 
hospital because of an innocent 
case oftonsilliti , but he left 
with the news that he had a 
cancerous tumor in his throat. 
This leave baseball fans 
wondering when and if Butler 
will be back on the playing field, 
and also what caused the fall of 
this well-liked athlete. 

According to Butler: 'Tm not 
giving up on this thing. One of 
these days I'm going to be back 
out there tipping my hat, and 
hopefully everything will be all 
right." 

ffowever, according to 
variOltS news source , the 
Dodgers see the $2 million man 
as a prime candidate for the 60-
day disabled list, and rumors 
have surfaced that Butler told his 
wife he does not intend to play 
baseball again. 

Whichever is the case, we 
need to realize the impact this 
has on a player and his ability to 
perform up to professional 
standards, as well as his desire to 
return to the game he has spent 
nearly his entire life playing. 

Dr. Robert Gadlago told the 
press that Butler's right tonsil 
was three or four times its 
nonftal size when he removed it 
last week - and that's only the 
beginning. Butler till faces 
urgery later this month to 

remOve suspicious lymph nodes 
and muscle tissues in his neck, 
and then he must endure 
f:,'fUCling radiation treatment. 

As far as causes are 
concerned, some say it was 
dip. Butler dismissed that 
possibility, however, saying 
he hlsn't placed a wad of 
chewing tobacco in his mouth 
in 15 years. This leaves the 
only other possibility to be 
nicotine. While Butler does 
not smoke, his parents did, 
and he was constantly 
exposed to secondhand smoke 
as a child. 

Often it takes stories like this 
to remind sports fans that 
although our favorite players 
seem larger than life, they are 
still human, susceptible to the 
same obstacles and illnesses we 
face in our own lives. 

No matter what, all fans of 
the Dodgers and baseball in 
general carry the same senti-
ment. It was expressed by a 
fan's siB" during the Reds-
~ . I:>od('ers game in CinciMab last 

Wednesday, and it was publi-
cized in many newspapers and 
spodICIIIa. /

prayers, Butler."

Shepard Corrals New Record 
CCAAs: The California Collegiate Athletic Association Championships offered a fmal qualifying chance 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

It may not top "Countdown to 
Atlanta, '96," but the UCSD track 
and field team's countdown to the 
NCAA Division m National 
Championships now loi ts at 
nine days. That made last 
weekend's California Colle-
giate Athletic Association 
Championships (CCAAs) a 
crucial final opportunity for 
qualification. 

Although most of the 
UCSD competitors who expect to 
be in attendance at Nationals in 
Naperville, III. have already quali-
fied, a handful of tracksters are still 
in earch of those precious fractions 
of a second (or half inches) that will 
gain them a ticket. 

For UCSD' Dave Spector, that 
ticket came in the form of a 15' 10" 
mark in the pole vault, which earned 
him an automatic invitation to the 
NCAAs. Also securing a trip were 
the women of the Triton 4 x 400 
meter relay team. 

After a lead-off leg by Odette 
Velasquez of I :01 minutes Ilat, 
multi-event competitors Joyce Lee 
(running in her fourth race), Maggie 
Dwire (running in her third) and 
Michaela Monahan (also in her third) 
doggedly pursued the Cal State L.A. 
team. What ensued wa the finest 
finish of the day, as the Triton run-

ners closed the gap between them-
selves and CSULA to 40 meters, 
before handing off to Monahan. 

Having already captured a win in 
the 400 hurdles by over four ce-

onds, Monahan knew the feel 
of victory and immediately 
went aflerCSULA's Martha 
Pinto (later named the fe-
male athlete oflhe meet) with 
ears pinned back . As 
Monahan steadily closed in 
on Pinto, the crowd came to 
its feet and Monahan's 

UCSD teammates ran along the track 
over the final 100 meters in a pow-
erful offering of support. 

With only 10 meters remaining, 
Monahan took the lead and powered 
home to victory. Her split of 57 
seconds Ilat capped a phenomenal 
UCSD effort, which resulted in a 
school-record time of 3:55.5 and an 
automatic bid to Nationals. 

While Monahan's inspiring 
come-from-behind run wa the high-
light of the day, the overall UCSD 
performance was marked by 28 per-
sonal records (PRs). Lee had pre-
ceded her thrilling effort in the 4 x 
400m by scoring PRs in the 100 and 
200 sprints. Dwire did likewise in 
the 1,500. UCSD basketball big-
man-turned-Triton-hurler Matt 
Aune sent the discus a PR distance 
of 147'2" and may try to push it 
farther for an NCAA bid. 

Ryl",: Lisa Shepard (right) had three top-three finishes at CCMs. 
"It's realistic that he could get it 

another seven feet and be on that 
plane next weekend [to the 
NCAAs)," Head Coach Ted Van 

Arsdale said. "He's throwing fur-
ther every week."

USA/China Showdown Marked by Chinese Support, Victory 
TUNE-UP: USA and China offered a partisan Chinese crowd a glimpse of international-level play 

Where In tile world?: Chinese (ans took 
over RIMAC at the USA/China game. 

By Robin Kezlrlan 
Staff Writer 

From the awesome display 
of athleticism to the chanting 
crowd that packed RIMAC 
arena, Friday night's showdown 
between the U.S. and Chinese 
women's volleyball teams was 
a sight to behold. 

While the con-
test - which re-
sulted in Team 
USA's second Joss 
of the four-game "orympic 
Countdown" series - may not 
have been international compe-
tition at its best, but it was none-
theless breathtaking. 

The size, strength and agil-
ity of the players was awe-in-
spiring. The flag-waving, ban-
ner-doMing, constantly cheer-
ingChinese supporters were out 
in mass. In fact, the only re-
minder that the match was held 

at UCSD and not in Atlanta was 
the faint smell and haze of smoke 
that seeped in from a malfunc-
tioning arena air conditioner. 
This created confusion among 
the crowd and stopped play dur-
ing the third game. 

Led by middle blockers 
Elaina and Beverly 

-----.....- Oden, Team USA 
gunned down the 
Chinese, 15-3, in 

the first game. The Chinese 
fans and team members, how-
ever, were not discouraged. 

While the Americans on the 
court and in the stands seemed 
lulled into inaction, outside hit-
ters Su Yue (23 kills) and Wang 
Lina (12 kills) jump-started 
Team China's attack, claiming 
the second game, 15-6. Thanks 
to the high-flying duo of Tara 
Cross-Battle, who tallied 28 kills 
and three solo blocks, and Teee 

Williams, who had 17 kills, 
Team USA stayed competitive 
in game three. 

Taking advantage of the three 
consecutive service errors by the 
Americans, however, China ul-
timatelyclaimeditssecondgame 
of the contest, 15-13. 

A wakening to the digs, spikes 
and blocks being traded on the 
court, Team USA supporters 
went to work in the stands, hop-
ing to inspire their team. Amid 
the reverberating hollers of "U-
S-A!"and"Chi-na!,"lheAmeri-
can squad battled back from an 
I 1-8 "deficit to tie the fourth 
game. 

China, however, regained 
possession on a USA net error, 
and middle blocker Lai Yawen 
stuffed Team USA hitters on 
three consecutive points, crush-
ing the United States' comeback
