York Opposes ABM 
at Washington 

by Paul Emus 
Dr. Herbert York, former 

Chancellor and now chairman of 
the Physics Dept. at UCSD, testi-
fied in Washington Tuesday in 
opposition to the anti-ballistic 
missle system. 

The Sentinel system, at a cost 
of about $5.8 billion, is designed 
to provide two fast striking, nu-
clear-tipped rockets, the "Spar-
tan", to knock down incoming en-
emy balllstic missles at a dis-
tance of 200 to 400 miles from the 
United States, and the "Sprint" 
to intercept and destroy those 
that get through at a distance of 
less than 40 miles away. 

Along with two other scien-
tists, Dr. George Kistakowsky, 
professor of chemistry at Har-
vard, and Dr. James R. KUliam, 
Chairman of the board of MIT, 
Dr . York gave both the technical 
and political problems of de-
ploying the controversial system. 

The hearing was well attended 
by the press as well as by such 
members of the Senate as Ted 
Kennedy and Charles Percy. The 
scientists' viewpoints so impres-
sed the Senate subcommittee on 
International Organization and 
disarmament alfairs that they 
were invited to expound on them 
at the White House Tuesday night. 

The principle speaker the same 
day at the Salk Institute, York 
said the ABM program would in-
tensify the arms race and make 
it more difficult to reach agree-
ment on armament limitations. 

He was also part of the na-
tionwide protest by scientists 
March 4 against the use of gov-

ernmen~ funds for research that 
develops modern arms such as 
the nuclear missles and ABM. 

In an interview with the Times, 
Dr. York presented his primary 
arguments against the ABM sys-
tem. "If such a system is in-
stalled," he said "people don't 
know if it will really work." "I , 
beUeve that the ABM is not worth 
doing because the probability of 
success in the real world" is 
doubtful "whether or not it ulti-
mately works on a test range." 

He said that because the tirTie 
scale is so terribly short, it "re-
quires that life and death deci-
sions be made by automatic ma-
chines ." Even more so than of-
fensive weapons, the ABM "must 
be continuously sensitive and re-
dy.' The two requirements of 
"a hair trigger so that it can 
cope with a surprise attack and 
a 'stiff ' trigger so that it will 
never go off accidentally are, I 
be lieve, contradictory require-
ments." 

Furthermore, he said that "if 
the record of the past is any 
guide at all, installations and op-
erational costs will be twice as 
much.' 

The ABM is one more step in 
.accelerating the arms r~ce which 
imperils our national security, 
York said. When pointed out that 
the ABM is defensive in charac-
ter, York replied that this be-

Dr. Linus Pauling, Professor 
of Chemistry at the University 
of California at San Diego, an-
nounced Tuesday his intention not 
to return to UCSD agter his pre-

The 68 year old professor indi-
cated that he hadbeenofferedand

In a statement concerning his 
decision to leave UCSD, Pauling 
said that "the opportunities for

would probably be best at Stan-

He added, "Among the factors 
involved I may mention the pre-

vision of responsibility for staff

Orr Lecture on ~~N eo-Marxist 
Dogma" Results in Controversy 

A week ago Thursday, Dr. Daniel Orr, Profes-
sor of EconomiCS, gave his Inaugural lecture be-
fore a capacity audience in the HL Aud. It was 
entitled "A Simple Empirical Evaluation of Neo-
Marxist Dogma." 

For the benefit of anyone who is not acquainted 
with Dr. Orr, his lower division economics 1A 
class was the scene of a confrontation between 
Orr and the SDS Critical Univerzity project. SDS 
students criticized the subject matter of Orr's 
class and claimed that it was not relevant to the 
actual economic force s determining the structure 
of the society. 

Among other criticisms, the SOO students enrol-
led in the Economic class want~ to be exposed to 
Marxian economics and the Marxian interpretation 
of the capitalist structure. 

Orr was introduced by Dr. Hooper of the Econo-
mics department. Hooper informed the audience 
that the essential economic problem.is providing 
a manner in which society can satisfy the unlimited 
human wants and desires it creates. 

Hooper announced that Dr. Orr would address the 
question of whether Marx was interested in analy-
sing how the allocation of resources in a capitalist 
society will determine the future. 

Orr admitted in the beginning of his lecture that 
up until a few month earlier, when SDS undertook 
thei r project in his class, he did not have any ac-
quaintance with the subject. 

At the beginning of the lecture a student request-
ed of Orr that he allow questions at he conclusion 
of his lecture, to which he consented, given the 
unusual circumstance of the lecture. No ordinary 
economics lecture would draw such a large audi-
ence, he said. 

Orr was constantly interrupted during the course 
of his lecture. One person in particular vehement-
ly denounced Orr and accused him of outrightly ly-
ing. This vociferous action brought many other 
people in the audience to their feet in objection 
to the student's action. Among those asking him 
to restrain himself was Dr. Marcuse. For a short 
period there was complete chaos, Orr glared at the 
individual, visibly shaken. 

At one interruption Dr. Orr was being pressed 
about the economic conditions of black people in 
this country. He had just said, counter to Marxian 
predictions, that the economic state of the labor ing 
classes was improving. 

"How about the condition of the blacks as com-
pared to say 1930' , a student a sked. Orr conceded 
that the economic condition of the blacks had de-
clined since that time, endIngwUh an emphatic "0 
K?" From the other side of the auditorium came 
a solemn reply. "No, U's not OK" 

The actual content of Orr's lecture dealt with 1) 
what is lacking in Marxian economiCS, and 2) a 
rebuttal to the traditional Marxian predictions con-
cerning the historical progre sion of capitalism. 

According to Orr, what is lacking in Marxian e-
conomics is a logical structure of the theories 
of value and of capitaliss dynamics. Orr also 
found that the theories of the future of capitalism 
were not too logical. 

Orr recounted the three Marxian predictions as: 
1) increasing immiseration of the proletariat 2) 
monopolization, ~d 3) exploitation of the poo~ by 
the rich. Orr countered these concepts with the 
economic facts that income distribution in the US 
is becoming more equal. On the basis of "ques-
tionable figures' (Orr himself questioned them) 
he made the claim that income distribution is 
more equal in the US than in Soviet Russia. 

In response to the claim that capitalism leads to 
monopoly, Orr asserted that monopolies are not 
coming into existence now in the US, nor has there 
been any change in the overall amount of industrial 
concentratioll for the last 25 years. Although some 
industr ies are moving towards greater concentra-
tion, this movement is offset by other industries 
moving toward a lesser degree of concentration 
he said. ' 

Orr 's rebuttal to the concept of exploitation was 
not quite as scientific. He presented af) economic 
situation which he f It Marx would tern exploitation 
and lett it up to the audience to decide whether or 
not it really W1S exploitation. 

After a few questions from students in the audi-
ence, Dr. Marcuse raise d his hand. Seeing Mar-
cuse, Orr announced to the audienc that "now we 
will hear an intelligent question. " 

But Marcuse didn't have a question; in his own 
words, he had an answer. Marcuse was explicit 
in refuting Orr's entire lecture, responding to each 
of Orr 's critiCisms of Marxian theories and predic-
tions. Marcuse explained to the audience that Orr 
had misinterprE!ted the concepts, and showed how 
they .could be dealt with in a logical Marxian fashion. 
Upon the conclusion of his dissertation Marcuse re-
ceived a standing ovation. 

During the question period Orr revealed that he 
had not read Marx since he was an undergraduate 
in college (up ujtil several weeks ago when h re-
freshed him elf) and did not have a complete know-
ledge of the economic concept of Max. This is 
not a subject on which I am overwh lrr,ingly confi-
dent, he conceded. 

Also brought up after the lecture Ha the fact 
that Orr neglected to discuss the neo-Marxian 
concepts of imperialism as r I~toti t~ 1:: ~ .t l",!ta 
tion of the third world. 

Orr stated at one point during the que tion period 
that "most economists regard Mar om thlng 
of a lightweight.'

flli'or;_' Orrwellian 
Economics 

Dr. Orr oUhe Economics Department spoke last week on "A Simple 
Empirical Evaluation of Neo-Marxist Dogma" . Never has a UCSD pro-
fessor provided such a spectacle. 

Dr. Orr deliberately chose his topic, as he said, in order that a 
large crowd of students would turn out to hear him. Apparently still 
chafing from the Critical Unive rsity rebuttals to his lectqres in Econo-
mics lA last quarter, Dr. Orr wished to gef in one more shot at SDS and 
otller anti-capitalist groups on campus. 

His tactics succeeded. The auditorium was packed with interested 
students, a great departure from most Inaugural Lectures. Further, 
since Dr. Orr had specllically aimed at a large student audience, and 
had chosen a topic lie knew would cause great controversy, he a priori 
waived the traditional decoru m of Inaugural Lectures, In which all ques-
tions are reserved untll the end. 

Thus when Dr. Orr stated certain arguments, many students res~ond­
ed with intelligent, pertinent question which should have been answered 
then. Dr. Orr's defensive, hostile attitude toward the questioners served 
to inflame a situation which could have been otherwise. 

To a large degree, Dr. Orr Is responsible for the disorderliness of 
the lecture. At times, he seemed to be deliberately provoking an out-
bIlrst from the students. We find such conduct deplorable. 

Tllere have been reports that the Academic Freedom Committee of 
the Academic Senate may bring up certain charges against some stu-
dents for alleged mis-conduct ai the meeting! We say they would be 
spending their time more meaningfully if they were to appoint an Aca-
demic Student Committee to investigate the qualification of Dr. Orr to 
speak on Marxism. 

Even more serious however, is Dr. Orr 's ignorance of Marxism and 
Neo Marxis m. After intensive questioning, Dr. Orr admitted that the on-
ly Marx he had ever read was some few writings, which he had "perus~d 
as an undergraduate". That means Dr. Orr has not read Marx for at 
least fifteen years. 

Dr. Orr's discussion ot the Marxian concept of exploitation, for ex-
ample, revealed an incredible ignorance of the doctrine which he was 
purportedly refuting. Dr. Orr did not addre ss hims'l lf directly to any 
Marxian or Neo-Marxian concept or predictions . 

Indeed, he had the insUfferable gall to dismiss Marx as a "minor post 
Ricardian" and Dr. Herbert Marcuse as "a Boston intellectual". Such 
self-serving smugness ha5 no place in the university. 

During the questioning after the lecture, Herbert Marcuse presented 
a short rebuttal to what Dr. Orr had said. His main contention, and the 
crucial one, was that while ail of Dr. Orr ' s statistics may be true, ev-
ervthing Dr. Orr said was irrelevant to anything in Marxism. Dr. Orr 
simply did not discuss Marx or Neo-Marxists because he could not, 
owing to a crucial ignorance of the topic upon which he spoke. 

Economists such as Dr. Orr have done a great deal to prevent an ho-
nest, open discussion of Marx in thi s country. By summarily dismiss ing 
Marx as being totally incorect, they have provided hundreds of hysteri-
cal politicians with the intellectual rationalization for the s uppression of 
radical idI~as. They contribute to the making of the Closed Society. 

Agaih, we recommend that Dr. Orr read carefully the wr itings of 
Karl Marx, and Neo-Marxists such as Or. Marcuse , and John Kenneth 
Galbraith. Dr. Orr chose to refute dogma in hls lecture. We wonder 
if he knows who the dogmatist is.

UNIVERSITY VERSUS PEOPLE? 
by Paul Emus 

Tile defeat of this weeks local school bonds 
came as no surprise to the academic community. 
Yet all too often this merely comes as an accepted 
fact. Students would rather ignore what tile narrow-
minded conservative community is saying and sit 
by whlle "the will of the people" is expressed. But 
perhaps a brief re-awaltening to this powerful 
force in the community is now necessary. 
A letter to the editor (of the San Diego Union); 

"Since there Is so much personal freedom of 
choice as to what our young people will be taught 
in our schools, supported by the downtrodden 
taxpayer, I will exercise my freedom of choice 
and refuse to vote any more money for the con-
tinuation of such bonds, buildings, salaries or 
other means for tile purpose of the over-throw 
of the country 1 live in and love." (L.W. Roork, 
San Diego, Feb. 25) 

Undell a big title: Reader's viewpoint: San 
Diegan Replies to McGill's Choice, this Is the ty-
pical attitude coming out of San Diego's major 
newspaper. Most people simply laugh off the 
San Diego Union. But how serious is the image 
that the community gets of the university: 

Certainly this is no bare minority that the 
Union represents. And yet is this the very com-
munity that the social thinkers on campus at-
tempt at awakening to such problems as racism 
or exploitation? Why is the public so oown on 
education? Why should an editorial in the Union 
be entitled: " University versus People" ? 

I feel that it's about time for the Triton Times 
to examine a few comments coming out of our 
"esteemed" local paper; 

"The fact that Marcuse will be on the San Diego 
campus another year, thumbing his nose at the 
public he is hired to serve, will continue to widen 
the gulf between the university and the people." 

What sort of propaganda is the Union engaging 
in? Is 11 true that the Union and perhaps most of 
San Diego really thinks that this world-renowned 
philosopher was rehired just to spite the public? 
And indeed, for whom is he "hired to serve"? Ap-
parentlya "servant of the public" is not permitted 
to question, even if he is a philosopher. The solution 
for those who do que stion can be easily seen in these 
remarks: 

"However, the regents' decision to suspend or 
expell exhibitionists, rioters and anarchists could 
begin to restore academic reason and public con-
fidence in education." 

"Regents of the University of California acted 
forthrightly, if belatedly, in mandating stiff penal-

ties for criminals on campuses who are making a 
mockery of higher education." 

Why are such crack-down tactics required to 
"restore public confidence in education?" The Na-
tional Guard, and gas-masked poUce seem to be the 
only way to "restore academic reason" while at the 
same time getting backaUhose "long-haired out-
side agitators." Perhaps this comment byareader 
wiD show us why there is this lack of understanding: 

"Chancellor McGUl rehires Prof. Marcuse, an 
avowed Marxist, to continue teaching our youth for 
another year, yet we continue to fight communism 
overseas." (F.R.Allen, 6310 Celia VlstaDr •. Feb. 20) 

"Professor Marcuse's activities are an open re-
cord on and off campus and I humbly ask Mr, and 
Mrs. America to join in defense of our country by 
looking at his activities and then say whether they 
want to pay him the tax dollars of$25,000 per year 
to espouse a cause which has already brought A me r-
ica to campus chaos and close to complete anarchy. 
(Harold R. Ingleston, 6536 Comley ST. Feb. 20) 

"But there ls no intellectual honesty when Mar-
cuse propagandizes against the United states of A-
merica and preaches a fascist-like doctrine without 
a balancing point of view -- the American view." 

There is no question in my mind that the UCSD 
student is exposed to the I, American view," but 
I would like to ask the Union what kind of "balancing 
point of view" the Union represents. Obviously they 
think that they are the one, true American doctrine. 
And yet they talk about" .... students who are preven-
ted from attending classes by physical violence ... " 
When has there been a case where a student on this 
campus has been physically prevented from attend-
ing a class? Could it be that the'taxpaying public". 
by refusing the money for buildings and salaries, 
are physically preventing those students from being 
accepted to the university? Who are the real' 'crimi-
nals who are making a mockery of higher edu-
cation"? 

The editorial ends: 
"The taxpaying pubUc will watch with interest to 

see how well the chancellorscarryouttheirrespon 
sibilities. Itmay be the last chance for 'administra-
tion hone sty.' " 

What does this "last chance" mean? Evidently, 
the Union is trying to brainwash the public into 
thinking that even the administration is part of some 
sort of conspiracy to undermine the" American way 
and thwart the will of the people of California." I 
could go on and give you all sorts of examples from 
the Union. But why don't you pick up a copy and see 
for yourself why Californians are "tired of rioting 
and anarchlsm on campus." 

THE SILENT MAJORtIY 

Report from Jerusalem 
EDITOR'S NOTE: 

The following is a report by 
Dale Pearlman, a UCSD under-
graduate who ls spending his 
junior year abroad at tt.e He-
brew University in Je ru sale .. Is-
rael. In the report, he discusses 
the day to day atmosphere of 
the city and how and to what 
degree the routine ola large mar-
ket place in Jerusalem Is dis-
rupted after an Arab terrorist 
bombing. 

A one square block area of 
the Mechineh Yehudah market 
place was blown up in a terror-
ist bombing last November 22. 
As I was leaving my dormitory 
that day, an agUated passerby 
gave'Tne the first sketchy news 
of the disaster. The man hur-
riedly described the incident: 
"Just 30 minutes ag ... bombingln 
crowded market .. .. some killed 
and manywounded ... very grave." 

Since I had arrived in Jeru-
salem last August, this was the 
first" m~jor terrorist action to 
take place in this ancient city. 
I asked myself questions as I 
and two friends caught a bus 
to the stricken market place; 
"What would be the reaction of 
Israelis in the marketplace? 
'Would Arabs be dragged offbuses 
and beaten by enraged Israelis? 
Would bands of Jews head ot! 
to the Old City to demol1sh Arab 
shops there? Would the market 
be empty of pevple, or would 
the place be in utter, terrified 
confusion? Or would it be busi-
ness as usaul?" 

The police were checking all 
vehicles approaching the scene 
of the terror. When our bus 
approach.ed the roadblock, the 
chief policeman gave the bus a 
cursory glance and waved it on 
through. As our bus passed the 
Shaare Zadek Hospital, which is 
close to the market place, we 
could see over 100 people an-
xiously awaiting word about in-
jured friends and relatives. 

At last we arrived at the Mech-
ineh Yehud::th market place bus 
stop. We hurriedly got off. It 
was now a little over an hour 
after the explosion had gone off. 
The market at first glance ap-
peared normal, full of the usual 
bustling activity of buying and 
se Iling at the tiny wooden stalls. 
Howeve(, the scene of the bomb-
ing was two blocks away, and 
as we rounded the corner onto 
Agrippas street, we were im-

LETTERS 

mediately confronted with evi-
dence of tM destruction wrought 
by the blast .. 

As we reached the blast site, 
a faint smell of exploded dyna-
mile and charred rubber greeted 
us. A cordon of police and sold-
iers sealed off the demolished 
one-block area, and kept tbe 
crowd of nearly 600 people back. 
lnslde the sealed-off area, I could 
see about eight fire-gutted 
twisted, blackened shells of cars 
which had been too near wilen 
the blast went off. Even a 
sturdily constructed reinforced 
concrete building showed tile ef-
fects of the explosion. Part 
of the building's front was mis-
sing, completely blown away. 

Yet, in the midst of this des-
truction, the market place re-
mained busy, and all the undama-
ged stalls and shops were doing 
a brisk pre-sabbath business 
(no shopPing is clone on Saturday, 
tile Sabbath). 

After a whUe, however, one 
could detect subtle changes in 
the atmosphere of the market 
place. Where bitter, highiy com-
petitive bargaining usually filled 
the air with irate remarks from 
a hundred different stands, today 
the haggering over prices 
sounded more like a subdued dis-
cussion, a mere passing of the 
day. The loud edge of bargain-
ing was missing. 

There was complete silence 
as the Announcer began, "This 
is Radio KO L, Israel. Here 
is the news. This morning a 
major explosion ripped one end 
of the Mechineh Jehudah Market 
area at 9:30 a.m. Ten peo-
ple were killed instantly, and '10 
people were injured, 20 of the 
critically ....... .' A gasp of un-
willing belief swept through the 
crowd. 

Leaving the market place, we 
walked toward Old City. On 
the way we saw several scores 
of Arabs hurrying to tile Old 
City. None of them were Ul 
any way molested or detained. 
They attracted no special atten-
tion. They walked through the 
heart of the Jewish section un-
hindered. 

Three days later,Ipaidanother 
visit to the market place. All 
the stores were open, and both 
Jews and Arabs filled the streets 
of the Ba:Paar, eagerly buying 
and bickering. However, in the 
Mechineh Yehudah market place 

proper, there were no Arabs to 
be seen. One could sense that 
things were not yet back to nor-
mal. 

Certain facts are now coming 
to light which bear on the mo-
tives behind the bombing of the 
market place. First, apparently 
the market place has been an 
economic bridge between Jews 
and Arabs after Jerusalem was 
unified following the Six-day War. 
The terrorists were attempting 
to smash tile foundation of peac-
ful co-existence between Jew and 
Arab which was being laid down 
at this market. Before the bomb-
ing, I had seen many Arab women 
come to the market to peddle 
figs and other home produce. 
While it is difficult to tell whe-
ther the terrorists intended to 
kill Arabs as well as Jews , at 
least one Arab was among the 
dead. 

The . second fact is that the 
terrorists were hoping to pro-
voke the Jews into violent re-
taliation against Arabs in Jeru-
salem. and thereby create a sense 
of confrontation between Jews and 
Arabs In this city. Lastly, of 
course, the Arabs wanted to dis-
rupt Jewlsh life as much as pos-
sible. 

The terrorists have had limit-
ed success in achieving their 
objectives. While no violent col-
lision between Jews and Arabs 
was sparked, Israeli police were 
obligated to arrest some 500 
Arabs right after the inCident, 
both for questioning and their own 
protection from incensed Jews. 
Undoubtedly, this confinement led 
to many sore Arab fee lings. 

The two-day curfew Imposed 
upon Arab sections of Jerusalem 
was not appreciated. and many 
Arabs were quite indignant over 
the house-to-house search for 
arms caches. Resentment of A-
rabs towards IsraeU offiCials un-
doubtedly occurred, yet 11 was 
not, apparently, a lasting senti-
ment. 

For I am pleased to reportthat, 
upon visiting the market some 
two and a half months after the 
bombing, all has returned to nor-
mal, with the loud bargaining by 
all, and the Arab women busily 
selling their dates and prOduce. 
Jews and Arabs once again shop 
at ease in Mechineh Yehudah 
market place, and for the pre-
sent at least, the terrorist plans 
have been thwarted.

Dear Editor: 

Your editorial of March 7, en-
titled "Lunatic Fringe' , discus-
sed an "anti-intellectual' dis-
play of uncontrolled emotion of 
one or two graduate students at 
my 
MY ProCessor's Inaugural Lec-
ture on March 6. In that editorial 
you missed an important point, 
and as a result, I believe, your 
editor ial itself is flawed, not by 
anti-intellectualism, but by 1110-
glc. 

During the question period that 
followed the lecture, I was asked 
whether I recently read Capital. 
I am sure that.question was rec-
ognized by the trained minds pre-
sent to be of no relevance to the 
substance of the lecture. For the 
lecture was a report on empiri-
cal evidence pertaining to, among 
other things, three famous prll-
diction statements that appear in 
Capital. 

The question implled eitller (a) 
that the three s tatements that 1 
looted at are not to be found in 
Capital (and they are); or (b) that 

I should have used the source of 
the predictions to test the predec-
tions, i. e. I should have examin-
ed the truth content of the state-
ments by rereading the state-
ments ( a pl'odedure that violates 
the ruies of logic and scientific 
method). Your editorial endorsed 
that testing 'procedure, or, so I 
infer from your advice that I pro-
cure a copy of Capital.

lief is an error which he calls 
the "fallacy of the last move." 

He claims that we are "not de-
signing the ultimate weapon but 
the ultimate absurdity." 

In reply to a question about 
Nixon's intentions, Dr. York sees 
two possibilities; "some sort of 
more sensible ABM " or a deci-
Slon to "review the entire ques-
tion of offence and defense, i.e. 
delay.' 

President Nixon is expected to 
announce his decision at a na-

Orr entitled his lecture, "a Simple Empirical Evaluation of Neo-Marxist 
Dogma' and then calmlydeclared that he had only "perused' Marx some 
15 years ago-as an undergraduate. As teaching assistants wf: would not 
put up with such a performance from our own students. Should a student 
turn in a paper or an exam in which he admits he has not read the rna· 
terial but claims the author's work is " dogma- ridden", "SElf-contra-
dictory " and "incomplete" , he would receive the appropriate grade-
an F. We wonder how a [acuity which prides itself on academic excel-
lence can tolerate such a performance from one of its peers.

by the Department (If Health, 
Education and Welfare against 
"autonomous" black studies pro-
grams might seem to be new fuel 
on the fire of student protest. 

But it is apparently the latest 
in a series of indications that, 
in its own quiet anti unsplashy 
way, the Nixon Administration 
has decided to "do something" 
about campus disorders. 

The President himself came 
down heavy on the side of "law'n' 
order" on the campus last week 
when he denounced demonstrat-
ors of all types, whatever their 
grievance, and publicly com-
mended Notre Dame President 
Theodore Hesburgh for a hard-
line stand against protesters on 
his campus. 

And this week HEW announced 
that it will use its pow~r to 
withhold federal funds from

Rights Act)to attack black s tudies

Columbia Gym Plans Scrapped 
NEW YORK (CPS) -- Mili-

tant students at Columbia Univ-
ersity appear on the verge of 
winning a central demand in 
last spring's rebellion. Act-
ing president Dr. Andrew W. 
Cordier announcp.d that he will 
recommend to the university 
trustees that a gymnasium pro-
pos~d for a Harlem parl( not be 
built. 

Last year the university call-
ed a temporary halt to construc-
tion on the $1.7 million gym, to 
be located in Morningside Park 
which separates the university 
from the Harlem cornmuni'y, 

after the gym and other Issues 
resulted in student protests which 
closed down Columbia for more 
than a week. 

But the issue is still far from 
dead. The fact that the gym 
won't be built in the park does 
not mean that Columbia will not 
try to build it somewhe re else. 
According to architect 1. M. Pel, 
who Is now the university' s mas-
ter planner, Columbia is turning 
its attention to another trouble 
spot -- the Morningside Heights 
community immediately sur-
rounding the unive r sity as an 
alternative site. 

Putting )'OU first, keeps us first. 

The university's expansion into 
the Morningside Heights com-
munity over the past 15 years 
has been an explosive issue with 
the neighborhood's residents a 
lot longer than It has been with 
the students. The university 
owns much of the land in the 
community, and over the years 
its expansion projects have 
caused the eviction of hundreds 
of familie s. The university has 
been generally free to do what-
ever it wants, but since the pro-
tests of last spring, it appears 
to be approaching the question 
with an increased sense or tact.

Crackdown on Student Activism 
Sees Arrest of former UCSD Grad 
(CPS~The week of March 3 

was quiet as protest go, but 
the actl(tn was varied and showed 
evidence of the new "crackdown" 
on student activism. 

In Tallahassee, Fla, 59 Florida 
State University students and 
FRED GORDON, National Secre-
tary of SDS and former graduate 
student at UCSD, were arrested 
by local authorltles Tuesday night 
for holding a meeting. 

About 400 other students held 
an all-night vigil outs ide the 
school's administration building 
in support of those arrested, who 
were charged Wednesday with 
contempt of court. 

The students were cited for 
ignoring a court injunction ob-
tained by University President 
stanley Marshall to prevent their 
meeting and hearing Gordon 
speak on "Revolt and Suppres-
sion on Campus." 

MarshalL last week withdrew 
university recognition from the 
FSU chapter of SOS, because 

" ''' OfUtI Uut( 

Impala Custom Coupe 
equipped for trailering 

"some SOS members in other 
states have advocated violence 
and destruction." He denied them 
use of university facilitie s . I- When the 150 students who 
gathered for the speech were in-
formed of the injunction, about 
100 of them left the meeting 
room. The other 50 stayed and 
were arrested peacefully. 

That would have been the end 
of the incident, except that Leon 
County poUce decided to patrol 
the campus outside with rifles 
and unsheathed bayonets. Ten 
other students were arrested in 
scuffles with the police. 

The most sobering action ·cif 
the week was at Ferris State Col-
lege in Big Rapids, Mich., where 
nearly the entire black population 
of the college was arrested while 
white students cheered. 

The Justice Department, under 
the urging of Michigan's Sen. 
John Conyers, is investigating 
the violence which broke out Mon-
day (March 3). 

Under direct authority of Mich-
igan Gov. William Miliken, more 
than 70 s tate troopers dragged 
300 students-250 of them black-
out of theschool'sadministraUon 
building, where they were pro-
testing what they called the "ex-
tremely volatile raclal situation" 
on the campus. 

A crowd of about 500 white 
students gathered around the 
bulldmg chanting "White Power" 
as the demonstrators were re-
moved. Ferris has been plagued 
for the past month with sporadic 
and serious tights between black 
and white students. 

At the University of Colorado 
in Boulder Monday, about 100 
students-balf of them black-
disrupted a speech by San Fran-
cisco State Acting President S. I. 
Hayakawa, and more than 500 
others walked out. 

Hayakawa, the man the Gallup 
Poll has called "the mos t re-
spected educator 10 America," 
traded jibes with the students for 
a while, but when the blacks at 
the front of the audience heard 
him returning their shouts with 
chants of "Blacks otf campus," 
they jumped onto the stage. 

Hayakawa retreated, and the 
students took over the micro-
phone. Most of the 3,000 stu-
dents who had come to hear Haya-
kawa stayed and heard discus-
sions by students from San Fran-
cisco State.

maybe youtl better leave it. 

California campuses were quiet 
the week of March 3. The teach-
ers ' strike at San Francisco 
state College ended, and almost 
all the AFT teachers returned to 
their class rooms . 

But there were ominous signs: 
Acting President S. I. HayaJcawa 
announced that Nathan Hare, 
chairman of tbe school 's Black

his contract -renewed when It 
comes up this spring. And he also 
said George Murray, the Black

CUBA .... TEN YEARS AFTER THE REVOLUTION 
by Bf11 Freeland 
College Press Servfce 
(First of a series of articles) 
"On this anniversary," he be-

gan, "our celebration is char-
acterized by simplicity." He 
was speaking to 800,000 Cubans 
gathered In Havana's giant plaza. 
n was Jan. 2, the tenth annJ-
versary of the Revolution. 

True to his word, there had 
been no military parades and 
almost no ceremony and Fidel 
(nobody calls him Castro) would 
be the only speaker. "We de-
cided not to use up one single 
gallon of fuel or stay away from 
work one minute longer than 
necessary," he told his aud-
ience. 

With that short explanation he 
was ready, by. the beginning of 
his second paragraph, to come 
to the point of his remarks: . 
"Today marks the beginning of 
another year of great etfort," 
he said. Thus for the next two 
hours the anniversary was all 
but forgotten in a discussion of 
tractors and fertilizers, of the 
surly zebu cows and the coming . 
cane harvest--subjects of over-
whelming importance for a na-
tion where now farmers, not 
guerr illas, are making the re-
volution. 

Cubans will always applaud 
Fidel, but on this occasion, the 
cheer s came mixed with a cer-
tain sense of distraction. It 
was a sobering speech for a 
people standing at a critical 
point in their history. The 
year ahead would probably be 
more important than any in the 
past, the second decade of the 
ReVOlution more crucial than its ' 
first. 

YEAR OF DECISIVE EFFORT 
Fidel spoke to those feelings 

in his closing words: "What 
remains to be done ," he said, 
"is to name this year." He 
listened for a moment to sug-
gestions shouted at him from the 
crowd. "If you agree, ' he 
said at last, "we shall baptize 
this year, 1969, the year of the 
Decisive Effort." 

That was my introduction to 
Cuba. For the next five weeks 
I would tour the countryside and 
travel freely about Havana and 
neighboring villages, finally 
piecing together enough college 
Spanish to converse with the 
scores of Cubans anxious to speak 
with "norteamericanos." 

During my visit I found the 
Cuban people optimistic, if some-
times overworked; disarmingly 
non-political in the mass, but 
deeply committed to making their 
country work. 

As for the polltical system, I 
fou nd its operation at times per-
plexing. At one point I was 
ordered to leave the country 
after I was suspected of hold-
Ing views hostile to the Revo-
lution. I came away convinced, 
however, that I had witnessed the 
most promising social experi-
ment in Latin America today. 

The accomplishments were 
just too clearly evident: every 
Cuban now had adequate food, 
shelter and clothes, and every 
child had the opportunity for an 
education. That is a statement 
that can be made nowhere else 
in Latin America and almost 
nowhere else in the enUre 
"developing" world. 

In almost every phase of educ-
ation, the statiStiCs, when com-
pared with 1959 when the revol-
utionists took over, seem to have 
doubled: 

Before the ReVOlution there 
were about 800,000 students In 
public schools; now there are 
1.7 million. 

Ten years ago those students 
were being taught by about 20,000 
while today there are nearly 
60,000 teachers. 

Before the Revolution there 
were about 7,500 schools, now 
there are nearly 15,000. 

What those figures do not te 11 
is who is going to school. Be-
fore the Revolution, schools were 
open only to those who could 
afford to attend, while today 

every chlld is required to have 
13 years of educH.tion. Nor do 
those figures Include the masses 
of adults who are now required 
to have a minimum of six years 
of- education - - some of whom 
are involved in crash programs 
in which theyactuaUy spend more 
time studying than they do work-
lng. 

Likewise omitted from these 
figures are the large numbers 
of 15 and l6-year-olds who serve 
as teaching assistants in pri-
mary school while they them-
selves are studying at the high 
school level. 

ISLAND CLASSROOM 
The inescapable Impression 

from a Cuban visit, whether you 
sample opinion of people on the 
government-conducted tours or 
in personal encounters, is that 
the Revolution has virtually 
turned the island into a giant 
classroom where everyone, with 
the exception of the very old, is 
Involved In some kind of for-
mal education program. 

One clear bene!lt has been 
that illiteracy has all but been 
wiped out--down now to only 
3.2 per cent--a level which com-
pares favorably to most "dev-
eloped" countries. 

It is certainly an experiment 
that has the endorsement of the 
majorIty of Cubans. Seduced by 
the scientific method, and com-
mitted to comprehensive national 
planning, they have been taken 
Over by utter fascination with 
the posslbLUties of their own 
Mure. 10 fact in his speeches, 
Fidel only beran talking about 
Socialism after he has run out 
of statistics. The reason seems 
clear: statistics tell a story the 
people can understand. 

In some ways, however, the 
progress In health services is 
even more startling. Tradition-
ally, Cuba, like most of Latin 
America, has always had a crit-
ical shortage of hospitals and 
trained medical personnel. 
Money could get you to a doctor, 
but for a hospital bed, the add-
ed element of a political con-

nectlon was almost a necessity. 
10 those pre-revolutionary 

days, Cuba had 25,700 hospital 
beds and 6,300 doctors. Today 
there are 47,600 beds and 7,500 
doctors. Many of those addi-
tional beds are included in poly-
clinics built in rural areas which 
had never had any form of med-
ical service before. 

Most of this has come about 
following a radical reorientation 
of the nation' s resources. Com-
pared with 1959, Cuba's public 
health budget has been increased 
by 900 per cent. At the uni-
versity level, nearly one out of 
every six students now is s tudy-
ing medicine. All of this is 
backed by a medical aid pro-

am which rovldes treatment 

for everything from a common 
cold to delicate brain surgery 
free while the cost of drugs is 
heavUy subsidized. 

This has meant, for example, 
that such once-common diseases 
like mlllaria, typhoid fever and 
polio have all been wiped out -
the best record in Latin America. 
Similarly, the inlant mortality 
rate, which in South America 
reaches 44 per cent among child-
ren under five, has been .cut 
sharply now that 90 per cent of 
all Cuban babies are delivered 
in hospitals. 

The success of the program is 
just now beginning to win inter-
national recognition. An article 
published Dec. 27 in the United 
Nation's World Health Orrani-
zation magazine concluded: "The 
aspiration of the Latin American 
countries (for improved health 
care) for 1968 is already a real-
Ity in Cuba." 

......... 

But the deCisive area of Cuba's 
planning program is in agricul-
ture. It is here that the country 
must succeed if Cuba is to dev-
e lop the economic base needed to 
provide all the other services. 

Next year, according to Fidel 
Cuba's annual agricultural pro-
dUction will double what it was 
when he took over in 1959. That 
statistic is even more surprising 
when you consider the obstacles 
of poor planning early In the 
regime that had to be overcome. 

In the early 1960's, the plann rs 
made the mistake of neglecting 
agriculture in favor of a crash 
industrialization program. That 
attempt flopped and, in 1965, the 

government called for a major 
shift In the economy based on a 
massive redevelopment of the 
sugar industry, backed by similar 
s trides in citrus fruit, tobacco 
and cattle production. 

But sugar cane, which now 
provide s 85 per cent of Cuba' s 
total exports, is a crop which 
requires at least two years of 
cultivation before it can be har-
vested. So the benefits of much 
of the work of the past four years 
are just now beginning to be 
realized. 

Last year 's crop topped 5 mil-
lion tons. That, however, is just 
a prelude for what the govern-
ment hopes to accomplish during 
the next 18 months. Financially, 
not to mention psychologically, 

the Revolution is staking its rep-
utation on the bel that Cubans can 
bring in 10 million tons of sugar 
by 'July, 1970. Billboards and 
posters urging support for that 
goal are the most common sight 
anywhere you travel in Cuba. 

But the 10 million tons, of 
course , is just a beginning. Ac-
cording to the Cuban planners, 
the country is now in a position 
to expand agricultural production 
at the rate of 15 per cent an-
nually for the next 12 years based 
on similar increases in new land 
made available for cultivation. 
If those levels can be reached, 
Cuba will be developing at a 
rate five times faster than most 
of her neighbors in LaUn Amer-
ica. 

According to a world food 
plan now near completion by 
the United Nation's Food and 
Agriculture Organization, the 
best that the 10 nations of South 
America can be expected to at-
tain is a mere three per cent 
annually - a rate which barely 
keeps pace with expected pop-
ulation increases. Cuba' s plan-
ned expansion is estimated to 
run seven times greater than its 

' population increases. 
"We are not saying that Cubans 

are the best workers or that 
anyone knows more than anyone 
else," Fidel says with unexpected 
modesty. " We have had the ood 
fortune of certain factor s coin-
ciding at the same time: the 
concept of agrarian reform, the 
mass application of tecl\nology 
and above all, a people carrying 
out thls program in a tropical 
climate." 

These changes in economic 
policy, oC course, have not taken 
place without profound altera-
tions in Cuba's social structure. 
For example: 

in many rural areas , thou-
sands of children from farm fam-
ilies now spend five days a week 
living in government boarding 
schools, going home only on 
weekends, as Cuba more and 
more centralizes its agricultural 
programs. 

A national rationing program 
which successfully spreads 
Cuba's food, clothing and luxury 
items evenly among the island's 
million Inhabitants is increas-
ingly rendering money as ir-
relevancy and a symbol of ex-
change. 

The threat of another possible 
Invasion or the acts of sabOteurs 
within the country has led to 
the development of an over-
whelming military presence 
made up of both army units and 
a volunteer, civilian militia. 

These and other developments 
clearly point to the fact that 
Cuba's efforts toward economic 
expansion are aimed at cons Ide r-
ably more than just provid1ogfor 
the physical needs of the Deoole. 

CONCEPT OF 'NEW MAN' 
What the Cuban experiment is 

attempting to demonstrate is that 
a society formerly composed of 
a mass of peasants ruled by a 
wealthy elite can be transformed 
into a SOCiety with real equal-
ity based on Socialist principles 
of collective effort and collec-
tive responsibility. lodeed, they 
claim that such a society can 
revolutionize the individual as 
we 11 - the ideal represented by 
their concept of the "new man." 

The national rationing system 
provides an example of how this 
deal is being implemented. 

While the rationing system has 
led to the inconvenience of wait-
ing In long lines for almost every 
commodity, it has also provided 
the clear guarantee that every 
Cuban is able to s hare equally 
in his country's wealth. That 
factor had led to a decrease in 
the Importance of personal comp-
etitiveness, and now a new con-
cept of work is beginning to 
emerge. Since work no longer 
serves personal economic ends, 
Cubans are encouraged to see 
themselves working for the good 
of all members of SOCiety, since 
all Cubans, no malter what theIr 
job, generally reap the same 
benefits from their work. 

At least that is what seems to 
be developing. From my con-
versations with numerous Cub-
ans, however, the adults find 
these changes much harder to 
accept than the children. One 
middle-aged man told me: ' I 
love the revolution and all, but 
if I have the chance to pick 
up something a little ext ra now 
and the, I'd be a Cool not to 
do It." 

When you speak with school 
children, however, particularly 
in the rural boarding schools, 
they are s tudying in schools, 
wearing clothes and eating food 
all provided for them by the 
government, Theyhave almost no 
contact with money for they ha ve 
no need of it.· When the y fin-
ally do go to work, they will 
be paid, but on a scale very 
similar to their frie.1<l , even 
lf they don 't do the same kind 
of work. 

They will almost certainly en-

African Offerings Reviewed 
u you want a good anthology 

of African literature don't buy 
Afriean Heritage (J. Dracbler, 
editor). 

It purports to reveal "tbe ricb 
cultural roots of today's Black 
Americans," and thls is ltsmain 
problem. The tone is too self-
conscious; the editor seems to 
be under a compulsion to demon-
strate constantly both the rich-
ness and depth of African culture 
and his appreciation of it. 

The outstanding exceptions--
the Sudanese "Song of a Mother 
to her First Born" Tutuola's 
"Barbing Day in the Town of 
Short Ghosts," Birago Diop's 
poetry, and Aklga's "Hotter than 
Red Peppers" --would be worth 
the price of the book ($1.25), 
were they not available in other, 
better anthologies. 

Of collections of modern Afri-
can poetry, one of the best gen-
erally available is the Penguin 
Modern Poetry from Africa. The 
editors have simply given print-
ing space to some of Africa's 
best new poets, and the result 
Is a wide range of styles and 
con~ent which gives free expres-
sion to the beauty, pain, hope 
and complexity of life as an Afrl-

There Is Soylnlta describing his 
color ("Ught or very dark?') 
by phone to a prospective land-
lady: "West African Sepia' 
at first, then frustrated" trenzled 
description in the face \the ear?) 
of ber obstinate Ignorance; David 
Diop's burning hatred for the 
savages who ravaged bls beloved 
country and enslaved his people; 
Birago Dlop's calm reCital of 
the communion through which he 
received the "Breath ot the An-
cestors." 

Tbe best general anthology of 
African prose- -oral tradition and 
wrltten-- whIch) have so tar seen 
is tbe two-volume set edited by 
Whiteley. The selections of oral 
prose are expeciallywell-chosen 
from a variety of traditions and 

of comment. Although not avai-
lable in paperback, both volumes 
are well worlh wrestling from 
the lofty heights of the Ubrary. 
where they lurk in PL80l3. 

There also you you may find 
Black Orpheus, a collection of 
contemporary African and Afro-
American short stories from the 
magazine ot the same name. In 
general, the stories are finely 
written, hiding a sensitive spirit 
behind a dispassionate style, as 
though their authors chose not 
to analyse but simply to reflect 
the rapid and confusing changes 
taking place around them. They 
are humorous, angry, painful, 
sophisticated, slmple--and mat-
ter-ot-fact. n Is perhaps this 
last which captures a Western 

Unfortunately, the selections to 
a large extent renect this at-
titude, so that even ignoring hls 
introductory comments on each 
piece is not enough. Rarely is 
Africa allowed to speak for it-
self; each selection must reveal 
a "cultural awareness" which, IIIIMMiiii~fo.rc.e~d· .... Ii .................. ~liii~"~""~ ....... iiliilililii

The auditorium was crowded. 

much too crowded, but it was 
worlh the hassle. From tile be-
ginning of Framework's set until 
sometime in the morning when 
they finally told Paul Butterfield

semi-blues. and mescaline fre-
aks vegging with the music. 

The whole scene at Peterson 
Gym was r eally cool, and the 
free food even lasted through the 
whole concerl. The sound equip-
ment was done well, and the 
breaks between bands were short. 
Aside from sucb technical con-
siderations the 'whole atmospbere 
was easy and the music was good. 

The guy who really blew me 
out was Taj Mallal. As soon as 
he started, the place caught on to 
It and he kept it going for all his 
set. All in all a good tbing/.

Joplin. JaniS, after bumming and 
singing some at San Francisco 
~rs picked up with Big Brother 
and explod~ . Since then she has 
continued up. On their first al-
bum, she sings out hard rock 
with things Like Down on Me, 
and Women is Losers. 

On Cheap Thrills, the scene 
changes, and she's singing the 
blues. The thing that keeps com-
ing back, both from the albums 
and the live concerts and shows 
is that the Holding Company just 
doesn't meet the standards that 
Janis sets. 

Anyway, the only way to believe 
Janis Is to see her. How can you 
tell anybody abou a chick who 
sings like a truckdriver and puts 
so much Into it that you can seee 
veins on her neck pop. 

She's been warned that If she 
keeps singing the way she does 
that she won' t be singing for long. 
She keeps singing. K.C.&L.B.

Netmen Upset UCR 
in Finest Match,,6-3 
The Triton tennis team came 

up with an impressive victory o-
ver strong UC Riverside 3-6 last 
Saturday. 

Coach Bill Gilman praised the 
team for theIr fine effort, in which 
three of the nine Triton players 
had their best match of the sea-
son. Riverside, a stronger team, 
should have won, which makes 
the victory all the more sweet. 
Gilman commented "This was 
our mos t Important match of the 
quarter ;" 

The scoring went as follows: 
First singles (Jim Hoffman) lost 
3-6, 1-6; second s ingles (Jim Ot-
bus) lost 1-6, 1-6; third s ingles 
(Steve Terre) won 4-6,9-7,7-5; 
fourth singles (Dave Goodal)won 
6-3,6-3; !lith singles (Bob Brown) 
won 7-5, 6-0; and sixth singles 
(Mernie Gerlach) won 6-1,6-1. 

UCSD also won last week's 
scrimmage aga inst USD, playing 
some of our JV's againstthe less 
powerful team. Fine perfor-
mances were turned in by fresh-
men Bm Smith, Bill Adams, Rick 
West, and the doubles team of 
Fred Heidrich and Greg AlIen,all 
of wlJom won. 

UCSD has a very tough sche-
dule , which Coach Gilman thinks 
should whip the team into fine 

shape by the end of the season. 
They should be able to hold their 
own against some pretty stiff 
competition soon, and if River-
side's loss to us is any indica-
tion, this goal is definate Iy in 
Sight. 

Ii INTRAMURALS I 
The BOI bombers lowered the 

bomb again. this time in an 46-
40 victory over the Weasels for 
the dorm league intramural bas-
etball championship. 

The bour long game saw BOI 
control well over half the re-
bounds and score on many of 
the Weasel's mistakes. 

Working on their oHense for 
a week, the Weasels came up 
against a man-ta-man defense 
which threw them ott. They 
could not make the changes 
quickly enough to jell their of-
fense. 

The Weasels were hurt on the 
rebounds, not being abte to gain 
backboard control orten enough 
to keep the ball in their court. 
Controlling most of the rebounds 
was Tom Harnsberger of BOI 
who also had 11 points. 

The outstanding player of tile 
game was Mark Butler of Bgr. 
Butler scored 22 points. Hit-
ting most of hi~ shots from out-
side the key, Butler drew enough 
fouls to go 8-9 from the charity 
stripe. Bob Pullman bit 10 for 
BOI, and Mark Fenton and Chip 
Webster hawked the rebounds for 
BOI. 

J obo Ringwood canned 12 points 
for the Weasels, and would have 
had more if it had not been for 
the tough BOI defense. Jeff Weir 
and Ford Mastick scored 9 and7 
respectlvely. Kevtn Moor and 
Guy Fulkerson had 6 each to 
complete the scoring. 

Monday night the Maphds de-
feated PhysiCS 66-42in the semi-
finals of the open league cham-
pionship play. The Wild Tearers 
and Mapbds have already played
