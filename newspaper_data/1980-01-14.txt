AS Funds 
Weekend 
. Cruiser 

By Riaa Lee Podolsky 
Staff Writer 

The Coast Cruiser going to 
the North County will be 
running on weekends , 
probably starting next week, 
until the end of this year. But 
after that is future is in doubt. 

The AS voted last 
Wednesday to allocate $400 
for the Coast Crui ser, half the 
money it needs to run on 
weekends until June. The AS 
is planning to ask the 
administration to come up with 
the rest of the funding. _ 

"The AS doesn't think it's 
necessary to pay for this, so 
this i. on a one-time basis only. 
However, any service that 
help. even one student get to ' 
the campus on weekends is a 
viable service. About 40 to 60 
people ride it each weekend," 
said AS Vice President Nancy 
Laga. . 

The AS was originally 
asked to fund $800 when "the 
Business Office carne up 
short," according to AS 
President Carlos Montalvo. 
The Council refused to fund 
the full amount because " it's 

. not the AS's place," said 
LaJla. 

The Cruiser has been 
running since Sept. 24, but not 
on weekends. "Last yelr's AS 
Council funded the cruiser for 
about $723. _ This year's ' 
council didn't want to fund it 
during the fall, but a 
com'promise was reached 
between AS Advisor Randy 
Woodard and Gloria Spencer 
of Housing, since it is a needed 
service," Laga said. 

The Cruiser has been 
running at 8:30, 9:30 and 
10:30 on · weeknight from 
various spots on campus north 
to Encinitas along the Pacific 
Highway.

Asteroid Collision lVIay Have 
Caused Dinosaurs' Extinction 

By BiD Knowles 
Sixty-five million years ago, 

an aAeroid about six miles ~ 
diameter collided with the 
Earth, forcing c;fu.t and debris 
up into the atmosphere which 
blocked out the sun's light for 
several year. and cauaecl the 
extinction of dinosaurs, a UC 
Berkeley physicist say •. 

This hypothesi. 
proposed br Dr. Louis 
Alvarez, UC Berkeley Nobel 
laureate in physics, his son 
Walter, a geologist, and two 
chemista, Frank Asaro and 
Helen V. Michel, - asserts 
that asteroid dust in the 
atmosphere prevented all 
plants from receiving the solar 
ene rgy nece Sla!y for 
photosynthesis . Without 
phot~sy~thesis, the proces~ ~y 

which planta convert carbon 
dioxide into energy via sugars, 
all vesetation, dinosaurs ~nd 
any other .pecies dependent, 
directly or indirectly, on plants 
for nutrition died. 

Support for this theory , 
according the the scientists is 
the discovery made by Walter 
Alvarez of a high concentra-
tion (30.160 times normal 
level) of iridium, a whitish 
metal, in clay layers from 
Italy, HoUand, and Spain. 

Iridium is a metal found in 
very small quantities in Earth's 
soil layers but is present in 
much higher quantities in a 
type of meteorite called 
"Apollo." The asteroid 
mechanism, as pt'esented Jan. 
4 in the annual meeting of the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, 
explained the high levels of 
iridium found in the clay. No 
limestone was present in the 
layers, indicating the absence 
of crustaceans in the ocean 
when the layers were laid 
down. 
. Dale Russell, a paleontolo· 
gistt at the National Museum 
of Canada, observed at the 
AAAS meeting that over half 
of the creatures living during 
this era, an era between the 
Cretaceous and Tertiary 
periods, became extinct at this 
time'. Both RUliell and 

many small vertebrate 
creatures were able to live 
through thi. critical period. 

Alvarez postulates that, 
"They may have been able to 
do so by feeding on nuts, 
seeds, insecta and decaying 
vegetation." After the dust 
settled and sunlight w~. again 
able to reach the Earth'. 
surface, surviving dormant 
plants and germinating seeds 
would have caused the retum 
of vegetation, he theoriZei. . 

At UCSD, feelings are 
mixed about the Alvarez 
hypothesis. Scientists here 
doubt there is enough evidence 
in the theory to displace other 
theories about the extinction of 
dinosaurs. 

Still, Dr. Russell Doolittle 
and Dr. James Arnold of the 
Chemistry department 
describe the hypothesis as 
"interesting." Doolittle says, "I 
am not an expert... but it was 
only one geological layer 
and ... there's no evidence for 
such a coUision. It's an 
interesting hypothesis ' 
though." 

Arnold, well known for his 
studies of lunar material, is 
more optimistic about the 
theory, and says his opinion is 
"very · much the ... me as the 
authors'.

US Iran 
Resolution 
Is Vetoed 

UNITED NATIONS (AP) 
- The Soviet Union last night 
killed America's request for 
economic snactions again.t 
Iran , casting ita second veto in 
the UN Security Council 
within a week. 

The IS-member council 
voted 10-2 with two 
abstentions to approve the 
sanctions sought by the United 
States to prell for the releue 
of some 50 Americans held 
since Nov. 4 at the US 
EmballY in Tehran by 
Moslem militant.. China did 
not participate in the votinl. 
Mexico and Bangladesn 
abstained. 

The Soviet Union'. vole 
against the mea.ure killed it, 
and East Germany also voted 
no. It was the I 14th veto cast 
by the soviet Union since 
1946. 

Voting for the resolution 
were the United Stale., 
Britaih, France, Portugal, 
Jamaica, Norway, Zambia, 
Tunisia, Niger and the 
Philippines. 

After the vote, US 
Ambassador Donald F. 
McHenry told the council the 
soviet veto was "cynical and 
irresponsible." He said the 
motive was "transparent ... an 
act of political expediency 
designed to buy Iranian silence 
on Afghanistan and Soviet 
advantage in the area." 

McHenry said the United 
States has already adopted 
economic measures against 
Iran and will apply them 
"firmly and vigorously." 

He urged all other UN 
members to "join in taking 
meaningful measures against 
Iran." Such action, he said, 
was called for by a Secuirty 
Council resolution Dec. 31, 
which reiterated an earlier 
council appeal for release of 
the hostages and called on the 
council to take action on the 
sanctions proposal if they were 
not freed by Jan. 7 . 

White House officials had 
no immediate comment on the 
Soviet action. 

The Soviet delegation on 
Jan. 7 vetoed a Secuirty 
Council resolution protesting 
Moscow's massive military 
intervention in Afghanistan. 

The Soviet Union is one of 
five permanent council 
members with the veto power.

hued on the corolary thai 
Aflhan independence would 
be safeguarded, and that the 
country would remain a buffer 
state between the Soviet Asian 
empire and the West'. vital oil 
resources in the Per.ian Gulf. 

So long all this arrangement 
prevailed, the West would 
acquie.ce in the requirement 
that aD governments in Kabul 
be acceptable to the Soviet 
Union, and the US took a 
carefuly defined secondary 
position in alii sting 
Afghanistan in its moderniza· 
tion eHorts. 

Thi. arrangement worked 
well until the leftist coup of 
1978, which in.talled a 
revolutionary retime headed 
by Nur Moo.mmad Taraki 
who wi.. .ub.equently 
overthrown by the now 
depoled Hafizullah Amin. 
Then, a. now, We.tern 
analysts JpeCuIated on what 
pouible motives may have 
warranted the upsetting of a 
mutuaDy _ asreed upon and 
beneficial balance. Among the 
pouible motives: 

- The Soviets were angry 
al having been exduded from 
the Middle East.peace proCess 
and wished to retaliate for the 
evident abandonment of the 
Geneva alternative by the US; 

- The Soviets were 
genuinely fearful that the Wesl 
intended to alter the statu. of 
Afghanistan and hence were 
compelled to preempt We.tern 
move. that were about to be 

implemenled thruogh the 
presidency of Daoud Khan; 
- The Soviet leadership, in 
anticipation of an internal 
luccellion .truggle, was 
.hifting from a normally 
conservative international 
posture to an auertive one. 

None of these explanations 
is entirely convincing. My own 
view is that the Soviet 
leadership haa .till not 
abandoned ita. normal foreign 
policy conservatism, but that it 
felt compelled to IUpport the 
coup initiated by fro.Soviet 
elements in April 0 1978. 

It was reported at that time 
that the Kabul leftist parties, 
the Parcham and the Khalq,

reform pro..-am of President 

Daoud Kahn. They were Afghanistan's pro-Soviet

L tre to the Editor \ t f 

Dylan GritiqueFound Simplistic 
Editor: 

I have sat on my handa long enough. I feel it is time that I 
expreu my fru.tration with the sentiments expreued late Ia.t 
year by Dollfl Guardian writers T eel Burke and Barry Alfonso 
concerning Bob Dylan'. Slow Train Coming album and 
aabaequent tour. 

Several people have replied to Mr. Burke's review of the 
album; I have little to add except that my impression of the 
article was that it was nol a reviewal all, .ince Mr. Burke 
devoted very little .pace to the album itself, but rather a 
personal diatribe against the writer's parochial Khool 
upbringing and the fact that Bob Dylan just ian't the way he 
used to be (a crime to which I too mu.t plead guilty). 

The article that disturbed me more was Barry Alforrao's 
review of the concert. The style in which it was written leads me 
to think that it should have been placed in the opinion section of 
the pa~r rather than the arts section. Mr Alfonso prefaces the 
article with several remark. that seem to indicate that he had 
lost any lemblance of objectivity in dealing with Dylan's 
current statuI as an artist. "Sure I had my prejudice. about 
Dylan's current material ... "; "I can't 181 I found his latest 
album ... captivating," and the dauic, "But I was willing to 
listen". (Thank you, Barry; I'm sure Dylan appreciates that.) 
There is a certain amount of hilarity in finding the.e three 
sentence. in the same article, much IeSI the same paragraph. 
For Mr. Alfonso to try to put up any pretense of objectivity in 
lieu of the first three paragraph. of the article is ludicrous and 
oHenlive to the intelligence of the reader. . 

Thi. i. not, however, the main. point of contention. AU 
reviewers have definite like. and di.likes and fortunately mo.t 
are able to overcome personal preference and write with at 
Iealt a modicum of objectivity. My Personal prejudices and 
those of Mr. AlfonlO a.ide, what i. central here it "rock" and its 
nature as an art form. If rock were a pure, undiluted art fonn, 
devoid of political, philosophical and spiritual expre.sion, 
then I too would find Dylan's vehemence "offensive." 
Fortunately for the farla of rock and roll (a group in which I 
include myaelf) thi. ia nol the case. Rock hat alway. been a 
medium for the expre..ion of one'. belief •. From the mililant 
Rastafarianiam of Bob Marie}' to the anti·nuclear Ilance of 
MUSE (Muaician. United for Safe £nerl)') to the advocacy of 
the "sex and drugs and rock and roI" lif.tyIe that ia so 
tiresomely reiterated by coundeu rock lI'oupa • 

I certainly have nol encountered any articles in the Guardian 
attcking the self.abusiv!r narciuiatic, sexi.t meuaga found in 
much of today. rock. I he reason is obviou •. 11Iese meuagea 

are in accordance with the currenl "me" generation'.· 
philosophy of aelf-indulsenl living and studied non· 
involvement. Whal Mr. AUonso aeem.to be ob~ting to is that 
Dylan has dared to rebel against this. Bob Uylan it going 
against the very structure he was 10 instrumental in creating. 
For nearly two decades Dy~n hal been looking for aoIutionain 
rock and never found them. 

Rather than 80under on (Led Zeppelin), or Dame out (Jim 
Morriaon, Hendrix, Joplin, etc.), Dylan found an answer that 
has been here for two thousand yean and took Hqn 10 heart. 
And it ia this that Barry AHonlO is ob;ecling to - Dylan'. 
"Belligerent" Christianity. Mr. Alfonso has no ob;ectiona to 
'Christian love" expreNed in "gentle and generous terms"; one 
would have 10 be a tremendous cynic to reject this portion of 
cm.t'. ministry. It is extremely palatable and simple. 

Whal Mr. Alfonso can not take i. the fact that Cmatianity is 
not nearly thatsimpli.tic. Living a life in Chrisl involves difficult 
deci.idft':and changes in lifestyle. It demands that you make a 
commitmenl in a world where commitmenl is sadly lacking. 
You must think about the manner in which you live. We are 
compelled to draw oUrselves out of the grey of our "my space • 
your .pace" karma society and draw some definite linea. We 
are compelled to care. It is this commitment and theae-difficult 
decisions that Bob Dylan is singi~ about. What Mr. Alonm 
calls "finser pointing proselytizins i •• imply a demand that the 
listener think aboul life and death iuuea, nol where my next 
.poonful i. comins from, or who am 1 IOingto .,., with 
tonight or where's the next party. Dylan aalu the listener to 
serioualy re~ upon his or her life and make a choice. ("You 
either Irot faith or you tot unbelief there ain't no neutral 

ground~') • 
There iI much more that can be said about the article. The

Groups Claim Blame 
In Aeroflot Bombing 

NEW YORK - Three 
persons were injured 
yesterday in a bomb explosion 
at the mid-Manhattan offices 
of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, 
police said. 

A man chased from the 
scene and caught by police 
was being questioned. 

The injured, two men and a 
woman who were passing by, 
were taken to St. Clare's 
Hospital after the blast at 
about 6: 15 pm at Fifth 
Avenue and 45th Street. 
Police said the injuries were 
not seriou •. 

More than a half hour later, 
an anonymous caller, who 
identified himself a. a member 
of the militant Jewish Defense 
League, told The Associated 
Press the group had "planted 
the bomb at · Aeroflot" to 
erotest the imprisonment of 
Soviet dissidents. 

Fifteen minutes after that, a 
man identifying himself as Ii 

member of Omega 7 told The 
Associated Presl that the anti· 
Castro terrorist group was 
responsible for the Aeroflot 
explosion as a show of 
"solidarity with the people of 
Cuba and Afghanistan in their 
struggle against Soviet 
imperialism." 

Police said the explosive 
device was apparently thrown 
from the street toward the 
building's glass windows.

Winter .ays that any

Other popular hypothese. 
explaining the extinction of 
dinosaurs, says Arnold, are ' 
the Super Nova Theory and 
the Changing Field Theory. 

According to the farmer, a 
Super Nova (exploding star) 
extremely close to the Earth 
cauled the deaths of the 
dinosaurs and many other 
creatures living at that time. 
The Changing Field Theory 
claims that the Earth's field 
reversed itself (North Pole to 
South Pole), weakening the 
field which blocks cosmic raYI, 
causing death and mutation. 

Amold, however, prefers 
the new Alvarez hypothesis to 

.the other theories on dinosaur 
deaths. "What's beautiful is

Coach Bill Morgan 
expected a close matchup, and 
he got it throughout much 01 
the meet. The first event, the 
400 medley relay, set the tone 
for the day. Joe Hernandez 
started the final 100 yards of 
the race one and one half body 
lengths behind the Whittier 
frees tyler , caught and paned 
him to win the race. Tracy 
Strahl, who led off in the 
backstroke leg of the race, 
qualified for the March 
national championships with 
his 57.6 split time. 

As the meet went on, the 
score remained close despite 
Roger Kurtin's 1000 free win, 
Lance Halsted'. victory in the 
200 free, and Hernandez'. 
100 free win. 

Then Strahl stepped up to 

the blocks for some more 
backltroking. He moved 
ahead of the two leaders on the 
final lap of the 200 yard event, 
nosing them out by .1 and .3 
seconds at the end for the win.

get on board, the first partie. 
started up before the buse. did.

ready to particirate in

was run on Thursd~y in this

wal short and fairly flat this 
year, requiring racers to get a 
fast start, and then skate with 
their skis to gain enough speed 
to carry them through the,rest

the GS, with Fenlon taking 
second place in the Women's 
division. 

AI the awards presentation 
Thursday night, it appeared 
that Riverside had edged out 
UCSD for top honors in the 
team standings by about two 
points. But, when the Scoring 
Committee sat down to 
tabulate the individual team 
point totals for the week, they 
discovered that UCSB had 
been given the credit for 
UCSD's second and first place 
finishes in the Giant Slalom. 

When the points were 
retabulated, UCSD had won 
the AU-Cal by five points.

Win Streak Ends in '1941' 
8y Lynette Tom 

Senjor Staff Writer 
At the age of 33, Steven 

Spielberg has achieved what 
most of his directing 
predecessors have done at 
twice his age. In three films, he 
has demonstrated the knack 
for creating a box office 
success, whether it be human 
drama (The S ugarland 
Ext>reu)J seaside terror 
(Jaws), or speculative science 
fiction (Close Encounters 01 
The Third Kind). It seems a 
shame that his next attempt, 
comedy, does not hold similar 
results . Columbia and 
Universal's 1941 stands out 
like the proverbial sore thwnb 
in the young director's 
otherwise impressive film 
credits. 

The film delves into the 
significance of December 13. 
1941, in the lives of the 
citizen. of Los Angeles, who 
are considerably shaken by 
the Japanese attack of Pearl 
Harbor six days before and 
understandably paranoid of 
the pouibility that their city 
could be the next target. The 
entire 24·hour period, based 
loosely on actual and simaar 
events 39 years ago, is 
intriguing in its conception on 
paper, yet falters in its 
realization on the screen. The 
screenplay by Robert 
Zemeckis and Bob Gale is a 
series of slipshod story 
fragments which riccochet in 
aU directions and are tied up all 
too conveniently in one nice, 
tidy bundle at the end of the 
movie. 

Comedian Steve Martin 
declares in his latest album 
that "comedy is not pretty." 
1941 adds to his philosophy 
by proving that the genre is not 
funny, either. The routines and 
sketches are akin to knowing 
the punchline halfway through 
the telling 01 a joke. However, 
the opening sequence, where a 
female swimmer is "attacked" 
in a Jawsesque settin~, 
manages to rise above tile 
pa'thetically predictable 
humor. 

Despite the sluggilh script 
and second rate laughs, 
Spielberg has not lost hi.

10 BEST FOREIGN FILMS 
Fala Morgana - Herzog 

(Germany, 1971) 
"I wish I could be alone in 

the world. Then I would be 
happy". In this unforgettable 
mystic vision, Herzog gets 
his wilh. A vitriolic diatribe 
against modem civilizations, 
Herzog savagely parodies 
modern man among the ruins 
of North Africa. His gothic 

sensibility creates a Bosehian 
gallery of earthly delights in 
the delert while the viewer 
sits there all8u1ted like a 
defendant at the Nuremburg 
war trials. 'Why does Herr 
Herzog run amok? I don't 
know, but hi, tortured vision 
is undeniably an original one; 
touched by madness and 
blessed by purity. 
Kings 01 The Road 
Wenders 
(Germany, 1975) 

Wim Wenders hal been 
criticized as of late for his 

WHO ME ... 

increasing sappine.. and 
nuddle-headed attempts at 
profundity but his shinint 
moment remainl. A sad and 
lonely look at pOlt·war 
German culture through the 
eyes of two down·and-out 
va,aboundl, Wenden 
explores one of hil favorite 
themes: the schizophrenia of 
present day German culture 
due to the omniprelent 
"American friend" - the 
cultural imperialism of the 
US. In a decade glutted with 
"road," picturel, this movie 
stands alone. 
Aguirre, Wrath of God . 
Herzog 
(Germany, 1975) 

This movie, as critic Rufus 
Weinstein has accurately 
pointed out, not ApocalliPse 
Now, is what Conrad's Heart 
of Darkness is all about. The 
Spanish conquistador., 
bringing religion and 
"civilization" to South
