an Diegan often gripe 
about not having enough 
representation on the Board of 
Regent . the powerful group of 
trustee which oversee the 
UC system. 

And la t Fnda)"s regent 
appoi n t m en t s were no 
exception to this rule: of the 
seve n board m em bers

the San Diego area . 

Thi new appointee. 
however. happens to be a 
UCSD ·tudent. 

Linda Sabo. a philo ophy 
major, will become the ·tudent 
regent in July , making her the 
first C D tudent to hold an 
appointment on the board.

Short Term Appoint -
ments 

A bigger problem facing 
both San Diego Regent 
Sabo and Frank Phill ips, the 
alumni Regent and an 
attorney - is that both have 
received only short term 
appointments. and con e-
fluently neither are expected to

Chancellor Richard Atkin-
son, in fact. expre ed hi 
di appointment that no San 
Diegan was cho en to fill the 
seat vacated by long time 
Regent and San Diego lawyer. 
DeWitt Higg . who r tired last 
week. 

"Simply put, this (mamtain-
ing a full term Regent) wa one 
of my top priorities," Atkin on 
told a Los A ngeles Times 
reporter. "and to say the lea t, 
I'm very di appointed in the 
end result." 

"People say that the student 
Regent and the alumni Regent 
aren't that powerful. becau e 
they are only there for a year," 
Sabo responded. "But given 
that we\e got four Regents 
who have been there for les 
than a year and ix new 
Regents who are just tarting. 
I have a much eniority, if not 
more. than ten of the new 
Regents because I've dealt 
with (the old board member ) 
for the pa t two years. That 
will Ie en my di advantage," 
he said. 
Inexpe n ive a nd Acces-

Sabo I'> qUick to offer a plan 
of actIOn a. a new Regental 
appointee: the LTC 'ystem

"It (u niverSity educat ion) 
hould be as free and open as 

PO ' ible. That' a high, if not 
the highest. priority for the 
state of California," he ald . 

"But there' an extremely

"A lot of people think we 
should put all the resource~ we 
have into computer clence 
and engineering, and rna)'

he gives a few e:...amples:

talking about cutting a law

"One thing that a student

Another for SD 
Congratulations are in order for Linda abo, the 

new Student Regent. abo is the first Student Regent 
to come from UC D. With Sabo and Frank Phillip~ . 
former UCSD student and the current Alumni 
Regent , San Diego will be represented by two short, 
term Regents , 

But none of the full Regents will be from San Diego 
for some time. On the same day that Sabo' 
appointment was announced, Governor Jerry Brown 
announced his replacements for six open positions on 
the UC Regents. All of Brown's designees are from 
Los Angeles or San Francisco; anum ber of the 
appointees are old political allies of Brown's, 

Brown's assistant was asked specifically about 
why there were no appointee from the San Diego 
area. She replied that Regents are tatewide 
position, and that geographical cons ideration. 
hould not playa role in either the selection or tenure 

of a Regent. 
While thi ounds wonderfully idealis tic, any 

person who has watched the Regent over the past 
110 years knows that is not the ca e. Before the 
" minor campu es" were created in 1947 (Santa 
Barbara ) and the late '50s and early '60 (mo t of the 
res t), Berkeley was given preferential treatment over 
Los Angeles and Davis. Since then , it has been 
campu es like San Diego, Riverside, and Santa Cruz 
that have been largely ignored in terms of regental 
politics. Who can forget that Edwin Pauley , Regent 
and UCLA gymnas ium namesake, did everything in 
his power to prevent the establishment of a San Diego 
campus by demanding that UC D be built in Balboa 
Park? 

A person who says that geograph y does not affect 
regental decisions is incredibly naive abou t politics . 
For this reason , it is imperative that the San Diego 
area be represented by a number of full Regents. San 
Diego is the second larges t metropolitan area in 
California , ahead of San Francisco, Oakland and San 
Jose. To say that San Diego does not merit a Regent , 
while the Bay Area ha most of the full Regent , 
ignores t he ba ic reali ty of demographics and 
geograph y in Cal ifornia. 

Jerry Brown appoi nted 13 of the 20 full Regent ' 
du ri ng his two terms as Governor. We can only hope 
tha t hl~ SUCCf.."'<.,or will gi\'e San Diego the attl'1l1 11ln II 
de. erves In future regenta l appointments.

Saving endangered species 
BY KEN COOK 

Pacific News Service 
Thanks largely to the 

Endangered Species Act of 
1973, the American bald eagle, 
an endangered species itself, 
will survive beyond thi , the 
200th anniver ary of its 
selection as the nation' s 
symbol. 

The fate of the law , 
however, is less certain. The 
Endangered Species Act is up 
for congre sional reauthoriza-
tion thi s year, and it critics in 
indust ry are determined to 
send it the way of the snail 
darter. 

The Nati o nal Fore s t 
Products Association (NFPA), 
for instance. claims to be 
"concerned that implementa-
tion of the act has tended to 
neglect or unnecessarily 
override other important 
national goals, uch as 
r esource productivity, 
economic growth and higher 
employment levels." NFPA 
vice pre identJohn Hall told a 
Senate s ubcommittee in 
December , "Too little 
attention has been given to the 
process of balancing these 
everal goals." 
But the Department of 

In terior 's own data suggest 
th e Endangerd Species Act has 
balanced economic growth and 
specie. preservation remark-
ably well. In fact , not a single 
federal proj ect has been 
permanently halted by the act. 

Accord ing to department 
figures, the US Fish and 
Wild life Service (FWS) in the 
past three years has conduct ed 
more than 9,600 con. ultations 
WIt h fede ral agencies to 
determine whet her species on 

the endangered list would be 
jeopardized by federally 
rel"ted projects . (Consultation 
is not required for st rictly 
private undertakings.) In the 
1978 case of the Tellico Dam, 
the ervice found that the 
project would indeed result in 
the extinction of the snail 
darter. The builders of the 
dam , the Tenne see Valley 
Authority, refused to consider 
an a lternative and an 
envIronmental group took 
them to court. But in over 98 
perct'nt of the consultations 
held ince Tellico, the FWS 
ha!i found that the projects in 
question would not jeopardize 
an endangered species. In the 
150 or so cases where jeopardy 
was found, more than half of 
the project sponsors accepted 
modifications suggested by the 
FWS to protect the species 
wi thout stopping the project. 

The remaining project 
either ignored FWS advice -
their perogative under the law 
- or followed it without 
informing the service; the 
record is not clear. However. 
only one project has applied for 
the exemption process added 
to the law by Congre s in the 
wake of the Tellico contro-

vers~-. and a court ruled that 
applica tion was premature. 

In 'hort , if environmental -
Ists, extremist or otherwise. 
are t r y ing to us e the 
Endangered Specie Act to 
sabotage development, they 
have picked a rather feeble 
weapon Even the Tellico 
Dam, which was rejected on 
economi c ground b y a 
CabInet-level committee in 
1979. was exempted from all 
fedt'ral law blocking it by a 

rider to an appropriation bill 
later that year. 

Nor do project eem to be 
delayed by the act for very 
long. The National Wildlife 
Federation recently studied 
more than 600 FWS consulta-
tions and found that the 
average time for an opinIon 
wa 7 days, 

An excellent example of 
where the act seems to be 
strIking a balance between 
economics and environment i 
an area with a tragic hi story of 
ext inction - the Hawaiian 
Island '. Hawaii 's lush tropical 
fore ts contain an e timated 
40 percent of America's 
endangered plant s and 
animals. Between 1978 and 
1981 , the FWS issued nine 
jeopardy opinions in HawaiI , 
informing federal project 
sponsors their actions would 
push endangered fore I bird. 
sea birds and plants toward 
extinction. In eight of the nine 
cases, some rea onable and 
prudent modification of the 
project saved the species -
exactly what the act wa. 
designed to achieve - and the 
ninth project was dropped for 
reasons other than endang-
ered species. 

This is not to ugge t trat 
pecie s are adequ a tel y 

protected in Hawaii or 
el ewhere in the Unitd States. 
Private development claims 
many. and though the FWS 
ha s an active recovery 
progra m for en da ngered 
species. it is small , dealing 
with only a handful of bird .

Linguistics 
announces a new 
course on language: 
Linguistics 5 
In Spring Quarter, 1982, the Linguistics Department will 
be offering a new course, Linguistics 5, Introduction 
to Language, a broad study of the distinctly human 
phenomenon of language. The course is not geared 
for Linguistics majors, but Is rather intended for 
anyone who is curious about language and languages 
and wants to know what linguists have to say about 
the subject. Topics to be covered include language 
and SOciety, language acquisition, women's language, 
taboos, slang, non-verbal communication, poetry, the 
origins of writing, general phonetics and phonology, 
syntax, standard versus non-standard language, 
linguistic morphology, language universals, and the 
languages and language families of the world. 

The course will be offc..-d MWF from 9:00-9:50 1m.

Business 
cont in lied [rom pa!(c :1 
we may assign too little value 
to the" mall" achievements. 
We build statues to the Steven 
Jobses on pediments of profit 

tatements, house sizes and 
magazine cover stories. We 
tend to overlook the means to 
glorify the ends. 

And, in our own imaginat · 
ions. we're beginning to rely 
heavily on one industrial 
sector - high technology - to 
produce the Horatio Algers of 
our generation. Already, the 
microchip wizards enjoy near 
superstar status as heroes in a 
fumbling economy. ([ndeed , 
with a name like his, Jobs 
could be a man for the 
Democrats in 1984.) 

But Steven Jobs hasn't 
asked for these laurels. Like 
Herb Jackson, her originally 
just wanted to develop a 
quality product and support 
himself in the process. 

The danger lies in the 
tendency to gauge our own 
aspirations, individual and 
collective, in tangible terms. 
Once a succes hits the pages of 
People, the story seems so 
simple, so exact. 

Few of us live in such a 
dream world. But the desire to 
do so may make us forget that 
intermediate ste ps are 
necessary and just as 
important.

BY BERT N. KOBAYASH I 
Although scuba divers see marine 

plants on virtually every dive, much of 
the re t of the commu nity may be 
unaware of some interesting facts 
about these organisms that make 
California water~ so picture que and 
producti ..... e. Let's go over just a few of 
tl.e mort' general facts about marine 
plant s. 

There i~ a dichotomy bet wecn the 
types of plants t hat are dominant in 
Ihe manne environment, and those 
that are prevalen tin the terrestrial, or 
land, habi!ats. The many thou andsof 
plant species (upwards of 250.(00) 
found on land are primarily the so 
called "higher plants" - flowering or 
rooted plants. On the other hand, 
l'lrtually all the plants found In the 
marine environment are \'ery simple in 
struct ure, and are called algae. A t idbi t 
for party conver 'ations: there are only 
some 45·50 species of true·rooted, 
flowering plants found in the oceans. 

Ther are all specie · of marine 
grasses, of which only three are found 
in southern California waters . Two 

Plants of the Sea 
species are surf grasse. (Phyllospadix 
species), and the third species i the eel 
grass, or Zostera marina Herein lies 
the first confusion bet ween we 
commoners and the botanists. The 
surf grasse~ are those long, stringy. 
emerald ·green plants that are seen on 
rocky bottoms in 'ihallow '~aters. 
especially in arca~ of sl rong ~urf; these 
are the plants that most of u~ ocean· 
lovers call "l'el gras ... . " 

Th true eel gra'>s IS a wide· leafed 
(uP to 1,_ inch wide), flat planl tha t 
resembles the ~ ·allislll',.iuthat I\e oftt:n 
.,ee in fresh water , tropIcal fi s h 
aquaria. The true e I grass is normally 
found in quiet waters; hence. IL is 
present in Ihe flood ('ontrol channel 
south of Mi 'sion Bay. This iqhegrass 
found In all the quiet bay ... along the 
southern California coasthne, along 
the open coast , it also occurs in isolated 
patches in sand bottoms at depths of 
20·40 feet. There is a patch sometimes 
pre 'ent on the south ide of the head of 
the La Jolla Submarine Canyon. 
directly west of the Marine Room at 
the Beach and Tennis Club. The 

intere~ting thing about thl~ particular 
species is that it is found world ,wlde, 
in warm. temperate waters . 

The three species of flowering 
gras:-;es have real root systems, and 
nutrients are taken up through these 
root-; They reproduce prtmaril y bl'

Student stress: physiological, mental causes and effects 
By JOHN CHINNERER 

Have you ever felt mentally "burned 
out" after a long study se ion? Can't 
think straight because of the four 
midterms you have to take tomorrow? 
Chance are your problem is due to an 
exce s of psychological tress. 

Student-.. l, .. penally at the college 
leve l, are extremely prone to 
dangerou ' levels of mental (a nd 
con equently physical) tre . The 
word tress is often used loosely , but it 
does have an exact scientific meaning. 
Stress i defined by Dr. Han elye. a 
leading au thority on the su bject , a 
"the body's non·specific response to 
any demand made upon it." 

Thi mean that when a person is 
confronted with a tre sful situation. 
the body undergoes various 
physiological changes: muscles ten e, 
heart rate and blood pressure ri e. 
re pirat ion rate increa es, and 0 on. 
These biological changes are induced 
by bot h phy ical and mental stres 
factor . 

Some stress is nat ural , and indeed 
nece 'sary, for our continued existence. 
Positive s tre ss gives us th e 
"competitive edge" in athletics, or the 
sudden ru h of clear thought that may 

be neces 'arv to handle a ensl: . 
Negat ive tre. s, however, can be 
harmful to physical and emotional 
well· being. 

The stress reaction has three tage~. 
The first stage. or alarm tage, enables 
one to handle most minor emergencies. 
Your body is provided with a quick 
'urge of energy, which enables you to 
dodge the speed ing cycl i t who 
suddenly materializes in front of you at 
the edge of Revelle Plaza . Under 
normal condition , your body will 
automatically eek to rest and re tore 
its biological and emotional balance. If 
the tressful factor per its, perhaps 
through worry or frustration, the 
econd, or resi tance, stage begins. 

The second stage can help in a survival 
situation such as injury , illness or 
prolonged phY ' ica l hard hip. 
However, if it becomes a chronic 
si tuation, its biochemical effects can 
erode your physical and mental well· 
being. 

The second stage should normall y 
give way to exhaustion, allowing your 
body and mind to rest , recuperate, and 
rebalance themselves. Inabil ity or 
refusal to allow your body to relax and 
re·energize can cause serious damage, 

including chrome high blood pres;,ure, 
increased cholesterol le\'eb. lower 
disease re. i.lance due to lo\\er whIte 
blood cell leve"', increased stomach 
acidity. headache. and other phy~ical 
aches and pain, and general 
hyperact ivity leading to mental 
phy~lCal l'xhau.,llon. chromc fatigue . 
and in omnia. The emotional 
co nseque nce include rapidly 
o cillating mood changes. anxIety, 
tension, irritability, fatigue, and 
depression. 

College tudent ' face numerous 
ource of mental stre s. These 

include lack of adequate leep, 
repressed and hidden emotion, 
procrastination (which induces 
"cramming"), competition, peer 
pressure. fear of isolation, and the 
choice of a career. 

Combinations of these stress factor 
ca n create a vicious destruct ive cycle. 
Procrast inat ion, which can cau. e guilt 
stres~ , leads to "cramming," which 

·causes mental fatigue. This 
':cramming" requires a consequent 
lack of sleep, inducing phYSical 
fat igue. The physical fatigue adds to 
the already present mental fatigue and 
is multiplied by the pressure of 

~ 

con'lx'tlt 'In lor cia, e'. grade", and 
I ht' I", 

The result oj thl" i" additIonal 
stres!">, arising from two factor., . The 
first IS a constant state of worn. a 
result perhap · of the fear of Poor 
academic performance on one hand . 
and peer pressure or SOCIal mteractlon 
difflcultle , which may be cau~ed by 
the abnormal amount of stre alread v 
pre ent. on the other. -

The second kind of additIOnal stress 
is frustration. whIch i" dlrectl\, cau ed

the red ~ range from pink 
th rough a deep velvet ·red 
coloration . 

A couple of greens ought to 
be mentioned to sati fy your 
curiosity. The one Ihat most 
gourment , ocean ·oriented 
" incredible edible" cooks may 
recognize i the common sea 
lett uce - actually one of 
several species of the genus 
Ulva. As its name uggests, 
thi plant i lettuce·like is 
form and appearance , 
although it s color is generally 
light yellow ·green . It i 
normally found in hallow 
waters, often being the mo t 
prevalent green in the tide 
pool . After careful washing, 
the salad fancier may include 
thi in the to ed salad and 
create some interesting 
comments at the table . The 
other tringy, slimy plant 
found in the same area as 
Ulva is probably one of several 
species of E~lteromorpha . It 
resembles a mat of 5·6" long 
green fine hair. 

One ot her green alga is a 
curiosity due to its common 
name. The bushy, dark green 
limp plant , seen at depth s of 
30 feet or shallower (often in 
tide pools) is Codiumfragile, or 
commonly called Dead Man 's 
Fingers. When the water is 
high in the tide pools, this 
plant stands upright; when 
the tide i out, this plant lies on 
its side due to its flaccid and 
spongy structure . I guess 
touching this is what it feels 
like to touch a lifeless hand! 

The brown algae make up 
the largest, and hence the most 
conspicuous, plants to the ea 
invader. The large kelp plants 
are members of this group. 
The long, deep·living Bull 
Kelp, Pelagophycus porra, is 
seen on the outside edge of the 
regular offshore kelp beds. 
This is the one with the large 
bulb (curiously containing 
carbon monoxide for flotation ) 
at one end of a long, stem·like 
structure called a stipe. The 
bulb has been used in the 
making of kelp candy, which is 
an experience in sweets! The 
blade on this plant are 
enormous, measuring 15·20 
feet long, and nearly a yard 
wide . Locally, these Bull Kelp 
plants occur between 70 and 
120'; in the clearer waters of 
the Channel Islands, all of the 
large kelp plants grow deeper 
than in the turbid coastal 
waters off San Diego. 

The regular kelp, what I call 
Kelp Kelp, is the Giant Bladder 
Kelp, Macrocystis pYrlfera. So 
much has been written and 
publicized about this valuable 
sea re ource that this article 
will not spend much time 
dwelljng on it , but did you 
know that this plant can 
exhibit growth rates of a foot a 
day! Actually, Kelco divers 
ha ve reported measuri ng 
growth rates of 1.7 feet in a 24· 
hour period. 

Of course, this is the plant 
that Kelco harvests for its 
alginic acid extracts, used as a 
hydrop hili c, emu lsi fyi ng , 
blending agent in making ice 
cream smooth, the foam in 
beer from di ssipating, milk of 
magnie ia effective, and 
sy nthetic cloth evenly 
uniform.

beds, at depth of 40 feet or 
I S5, is wher one starts s ing

Biologist examilzes life under the sea 
cont inued frolll page 8 
Kelp. This species of brown 
algae, Egregia nzetlziesii, is the 
one to avoid becoming 
entangled with, inasmuch as 
its stipe is leather-like and 
most difficult to break. There 
are two forms of this plant. 
The young, vigorous-growing 
plant is made upof blades up to 
an inch wide and 6 inches long 
with a small flotation bulb just 
at the stipe - there are lots of 
these blades along the entire 
length of the stipe; the old-
over·the-hill plants (like orne 
of us) have lost the bulbs and 
consist of the stipe plus 
remnants of the blades that 

look like lots of hairs. 
The Palm Kelp, Erisenia 

arborea, i what many abalone· 
seeker use for both spotting 
productive areas, and for use 
as handholds in combatting 
currents. There are dozens of 
other species of brown algae, 
but the ones mentioned above 
arc the most common and 
prominent. 

The ,oed algae are the most 
diverse and frustrating in 
identification . In order to 
properly identify the 4000 plus 
species of reds , one needs to 
inspect reproductive parts 
under a microscope. Thus, I 

always categorize red s a 
crus tose reds, coralline reds, 
or soft reds. The crustose reds 
form a purplish to dark 
reddish coating over rocks and 
shells, and are almost rock 
hard . They are thus 
completely protected from 
grazing by plant-eaters. The 
corraline ones are those which 
deposit calcium carbonate 
along the outer margins of the 
blades. Thus, these have a 
purplish to pinkish tinge or 
contain an actual whitish 
margin. These are semi-
protected from herbivores. 
The soft reds are generally a 
deep red todark blood·redcolor 

and appear to be soft and 
appealing to grazers to eat. 
Recent work at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
indicates t hat many of these 
forms are protected chemi-
cally. 

One of the soft red algae is of 
particular interest to sushi-
eaters. The genus Poyphyra is 
a large-bladed plant; in Japan, 
it is raised commercially and 
dried and seasoned. The 
blades are then pressed into 
square sheets and marketed as 
"nori." This is the black sheet 
of seaweed that is wrapped 
around a rice cake that sushi 
fanciers are familiar with.

Porphyra is pre se nt in 
southern California . It is about 
10·)2 inches tall , with broad , 
wide, and flat leaves that are 
deep wine·red in coloration. 

I suggest a couple of 
references to those of you who 
are curious about red a lgae 
and need a lot of information 
about them: Joan Stewart. at 
Scripps In st itution of 
Oceanography, is an expert on 
red algae; or, Abbot and 
Hollenberg's Marine Algae of 
California (1976, Stanford 
U niversi ty Press) devotes 
more than half of its 800 plus 
pages to red algae. 

Species 
cnntinued from pa~e 2 
of t he art has not been 
encouragi ng. The budget of 
the e ndangered species 
programs has been cut 22 
percent. The solicitor's office 
has blocked the specie ·listing 
process completely, and not 
one species has been added, 
though many are deserv ing. 
Moreover , the budget for 
listing activities has been 
halved, and grant to tate for 
endangered species work has 
been eliminated. 

With this track record, 
environmentali t feared that 
Watt would come out strongly 
again t the Endangered 
Species Act this year. But it 
now appears that the 
department has adopted a 
wait-and- ee attitude, poss ibly 
because a key Republican 
enator, John Chafee of Rhode 

Island, feels the act has 
worked quite well. Also, for all 
its complaining, industry has 
'not been able to build a very 

trong ca e again t the act. 

UC courses 
eliminated 

Facing a cut of $33.5 million 
in its base budget for 1982-83, 
the University of California 
will ha ve to reduce or 
eliminate ce rtain se lected 
courses of study. UC President 
David S. Saxon told UC 
Regents on February 18 at 
their meeting in San 
Francisco. 

Most of the cut can be 
reconciled by a com bination of 
measures , including a 
propo ed $100 a year increase 
in student fees. but those 
measures "leave a balance of 
nearly $9 million which will 
have to be accommodated 
through redu c tion s to 
in truct ional programs and 
related academic support 
programs," he said . 

axon stressed that there 
had been extensive consulta-
tion within the University 
before the general outline, 
presented to Regents by 
Academi c Vi ce President 
Willi am R. Frazer , was 
developed. 

" We plan to pha se in 
reductions ... over about four 
years in order to allow 
currently enro lled students 
time to co mplete their 
degrees," Frazer told Regents.

The Merlin of Muir 
UCSD student, Jon Silver, balances career 
as professional magician with schoolwork 

BY PAUL NAGEL 
It is infrequent when one 

hear of aspiring young artists 
. who, spurned on by commit· 

ment, devotion, and talent. 
manage to make a successful 
co ntributi on to their 
respective fields . Such is the 
case with Jon Silver, UCSD's 
own profe sional magician. 

Silver , a junior at Muir 
College, has already accom· 
plished a much a many 
would in an entire career. He 
ha performed hi magic at 
popular night clubs, particu-
larly the Magic Castle in 
Hollywood, as well as outdoor 
amu ement parks uch as Sea 
World. where he has worked 
since 1979. 

Silver has also toured with 
the famous magician David 
Copperfield, and was an 
assistant to Copperfield's two 
television specials in 1980 and 
1981. In 1978, Silver was 
featured at the World 
Congress of Magicians in 
Brus els. Just recently he 
formed his own company in 
San Diego called "Magic Show 
Associates," which designs 
illusions for rock concert , 
amusement park shows, and 
other artistic events. And all 
this before graduating from 
college. 

These achievements , 
incredible as they are, reflect 
long hours of practice and 
serious dedication on Silver's 
part to the art of magic . In a 
recent interview, he talked 
about his beginnings. "I first 
got interested in magic in sixth 
grade when I was sick in bed , 
and my father bought me my 
first ma~ic kit. I really liked 

it." After thl Inlttal expo ure, 
his interest increa ed and he 
began frequenting magic 
shops, reading magic books, 
and practicing new tricks at 
every possible moment. 

By high school, he was 
workin~ ni~ht club. where he 
developed a "clo e· 
up magic" s tyle -
sleight·of·hand , 
ca rd and coin trick , 
and other favorites . 
It was at the Magic 
Cast Ie w here he met 
Da vid Copperfield, a 
meeting that sub-
seq uently led to hi 
work on the televis· 
ion specials. 

Silver feel his 
relation hip with 
David Copperfield 
and his exposure to 
television has help· 
ed him creatively. 
" For me it was like a 
training period, 
where I was learn· 
ing how to think in 
magic , There's so 
much more that YOU 
have to go through in putting 
on a TV show than in doing 
somet hing live. The pressures 
eem much more intense." 

As for future plans, he cite 
an interest in mass communi· 
cation, A communications 
major here at UCSD, he states, 
"Mass influence really 
fascinates me - how one can 
take so many people and sway 
their opinions. As in voting, for 
instance. I'd like to use my 
magic as a vehicle to get into 
the communication field ." 

However, he insists that he 
will never lose his interest for 

The Cathol ic Community 
at U.C.S.D.

magic , no mat ter what 
profession he enters. He feels 
magic is an important artistic 
field , comparable to uch other 
expressive professions as 
acting, and believes the 
magician to be a true artis t . " I 
think of magic and illusions in 

a mechanical ense - it's up to 
the magician's showmanship 
and his theatrical ability to 
make it entertaining. Just as 
an actor may play the part of a 
Western gun linger, a 
magician plays the part of a 
per on who ha s magi c 
powers" . 

He feels style is also an 
important quality in a 
magician . "There are 
definitely very different styles 
in magic. You could compare, 
let's say, the magic of David 
Copperfield to the illusory 

ma~ic of Dou~ Henning. I .

haven't reall y had the 
opportunity to work with 
elaborate sets, curtains, and 
lighting. so I'm still developing 
my own style." 

In his show , Silver tries to 
close the gap between the 
audience and himself by 
bringing people up on tage 
and incorporating them into 
his presentation. "I try to put a 
lot of per onality in my shows 
to relate to the audience. The 
kind of style I'm trying to 
develop is one which breaks 
the barrier between the 
audience and the magician. I 

want to how them that I'm a 
normal human being rather 
than a superficial entity that 
you can't touch." 

A for hi favorite type of 
magic: " I like illu Ion that 
seem impoSSIble but not 0 
fantastic that the audience 
doesn't believe it. In the 
future, I would like to do large-
scale illu ion with a large 
animal - maybe a whale." 

Is it really poSSIble? 
"I think I can do it ." 
If hi pa t accompli hment 

are any indication, Jon ilver 
hould have no problem.

Poetry, music and videos 
highlight 'Lexical' concert 
BY GREGORY CHAPELLE 
For closet poets who didn't 

go to Friday night's 
performance of "Lexical 
Music," it' s your loss. The 
performance, presented by the 
"On Behalf of Music Series ," 
and spon ored by the Music 
Department , contained what 
could onl y be term ed a 
virtu ally untapped resource in 
music. 

Ch arles Am ir kh an ia n 
performed hi s own particu lar 
brrand of music through 
voca li zat ion. It was at the 
same time both music and 
poetry. 

He read "poet ic lines" that 

relied heavily on the conlilluat 
alliteration of cons tan ts and 
key sounds and rhyming 
words that flow smoother 
than normal poetry does. 
However, in his attempt to 
give the listener a lyrical 
ballad through his word and 
sound choices, he sacrificed 
the abili ty to transfe r a 
cohes ive message to the 
listener. 

Think ing about the words 
he wa. u~ing and how he was 
using them sti fl ed any ability 
to enjoy the purely IVrlcal 
sound he was creati ng. To 
simply hear, but not listen, 
became a minor challenge that

Atotnicafe set to 
perfortn this Tues. 

Atomicafe, the UCSD contemporary musicse ries, continues to 
provide food for thought. Despite fears that last year's loss of 
leadership would lead to di sarray in programming, the past two 
concerts, under new directorship, have proven the contrary. 

Atomicafe continues to improve every year, and now show 
focu s along with innovation. Care is taken to provide formal 
balance in the overall program , giving the audience a sense of 
cohesive unity, without compromising variety or interest. 

The first concert of this season was bookended by two 
percussion pieces. The concludIng piece by Russ Kozerski was 
perhaps t he highlight of the concert , and featured spirited 
vocalist Chere Cambell accompanied by percussionists Daniel 
Dunbar and John Flood . 

The second conert opened and closed with electronic music. 
The last work, by Nicola Verin, was stunningly choreographed 
with visual by Dominique Piollet. 

This next Atomicafe will feature a variety of pieces ranging in 
style from jazz·pop composer Bob Willey's Man Ought 10 Sit 
Quiet to a world premier performance of Italian composer Carlo 
Landini 's classic Sonata for solo flute. Also included in the 
concert will be two clarinet pieces featuring faculty clarinetist 
William Powell, Catherine Schieve's Tiger's Eye and Steve 
Knopoff's Exemplar and Variations . Susan Moore's Too's 'n ' 
Tree 's will complete the program. 

The concert is Tuesday, Feb. 23, at 8 p.m. in Mandeville 
Recital Hall, and is free and open to the pu blic. 

McCaffery at SUSHI 
Canadian writer, poet, and performer, Stephen McCaffery will 

perform an evening of his works Tuesday at 8 p.m. at SUSHI. 
McCaffery is an internationally known writer whose works are 
widely published. He has performed throughout North America 
and Europe in the past few years. 

SUSHI is an alternative performance/ exhibition space located 
at 852·8th Avenue in Downtown San Diego. Admission to this 
reading will be $.1.50. For more information, call CME, 452·438:l, 
or SUSHI, 235·8466. 

some people cou ld not 
overcome and hence left before 
the program was half fini shed . 

Amirkhanian's use of tape 
delays and tape loops added 
another com plete dimension to 
th e a lr ea d y co nt o ur ed 
wordscape pre.ented . 

A highlight of the program 
was when Carol Law ca me 
down out of the project ion 
booth where she had been 
presenting her visual art. and 
performed a duet with 
Amirkhanian, entitled 
"Church Car." 

This gavc the audience a 
chance to not only see who. e 
s urrea I art t hey were seei ng on 
the screen, bu t helped them 
understand t hat the music 
needn't have been performed 
on tape loop, but is just as 
easi ly presented entirely live. 

The audience seemed well 
t em pered and took the 
performance more as enter· 
tainment than as a seriou'i art 
form. This made it much 
easier for the performers who 
apparently enjoyed t hem· 
sel ves. 

The piece " His tory of 
Collage" set the audience 
laughing through mo·t of it by 
using funn y key phrases that 
reflected them elves in t he art 
of Carol Law. 

Law's visual projection art 
presented the much more 
mysterious s ide of the work . 
Of ten time the pictures were 
interesting, if not puzzling, in 
their relationship to Amirk· 
hanian' s recitat ions, and 
provided an almost unneeded 
enhancement to Amirkha· 
nian 's overpowering words. 

The entire concert presen· 
ted multifacets of Amirkha· 
nian's and Law's art ranging 
from the serious "Mahogany 
Ballpark" to the comical 
"Awe," So you poet s that 
mi sed the concert have also 
mis ed the insightfulness and 
imaginitive way of dealing 
with words' sound that wa 
both ent e rtaining and 
inspiring.

Picture this: the final buzzer has sounded, the 

score: UCSD 71, Cal Lutheran 58. The women take 
t heir respective sides after a brief hand hake and 
wait for the announcer. The tension is mounting. 
The announcer finally quits <; huffling his papers 
a nd starts with the presentation . " ... and to present 
the award for the worst overall performance of 
tonight's contest is head coach of the Tritons - Judy 
Malone." 

Ms. Malone steps to the microphone and says, 
"The envelope, please." She is handed two, and the 
crowd tirs as she opens the first, and then the 
second. 

"For the worst overall performance by an 
individual in tonight's game, we have two winners 
- it's a tie between the two referees!" 

The crowd goes wild in the stands; the two 
referees shake hands with each other first, and then 
with Malone. The game is over, the awards are 
given, and the crowd filters out the door. 

The most intriguing part of Friday's game was the 

referees, those cowardly cops of the court. One 
looked like he had just dropped in from the 1940s -
from the Twilight Zone. His ha ir stylist, 
undou btably from Camp Pendleton, left thi !> man's 
head an array of bald patche and grease. 

The other was is ued a whistle, probabl y from the 
forties also. that must have had little hole drilled all 
over, because he would blow on that thing until he 
was red in the fa ce, and with no more sou nd than a 
new sneaker on a gym floor. 

These two men with the black pin t ripes should 
have been dressed in all white, with thei r own 
private padded cell. They called everything wrong 
for both teams. Time after t ime , Tri ton center Mary 
Egan blocked shots left and right , only to. see th~ ref 
waving his arms wildly because hIS whIst le 
wouldn't work. 

Guard Wendy Freed was thrown into the stands 
several times while attempting to pick up a loose 
ball, while that ref tried to shake the little ball in his 
whistle to see if spit had clogged up the end. These 
two comedians had all the authority of a three·day 
old bottle of plain scotch whis~y . 

The econd most intriguing partofthegamecame 
from the Triton bench where Judy Malone sat Cal 
Lutheran had Just narrowed the Triton\' marg1l1 b} 
four points v,' hen Malone called for a 12·2 half court 
pre s. It worked beautifully. 

Wendy Freed and Brenda weatt went to work; 
they stole pass after pass and shut down the 
Lutheran's hot· shot guard Li a 'anchez. Malone,on 
the effectiveness of the late press said, "Our game 
plan was to not let Sanchez h t. We had to keep 
her away from the rim." 

Brenda Sweatt led the Tritons with 23 POll1t~, 
while star guard Paulette Parker and Wendy Freed 
were hampered with mjuries. "Everybody wanted 
th is Win." Ma lone continued. "This team 
(Lu theran) beat PI. Lorna, and 10 t to Cal Baptist b> 
only two. They have improved tremendously from 
the fir t time we met thi season." 

The Triton are now in third place with a 2·4 
record in league. Thei r next game wi ll be played on 
Tuesday, Feb. 23, again t US[U at the Mission Bay 
High School gym.

SUPERSTARS '82 
Maybe it' coincidental. but the 

same names keep popping up year 
after year at the UCSD Super tars 
event. 

Could it be in fact, that people, 
like Rick Wilbert , Craig Kreeger, 
Hal Light, and Elaine Bergman 
really are the best all-araound 
athletes on the UC D campus? 

If their performance over the 
past years are an indicator, then , in 
fact. it may be so. 

No performance in rntramural 
Sport has quite approached theone 
given last year by Wilbert, 
Bergman . Kreeger a nd Co. 
Matching each other event for 
event. and chalking up one great 
mark after another. this trio 
comp l ete l v shattered the 
chall nglng S~perstars POInt tablrs. 

After the du.;t had sell led \\'ilhert 
had effecll\'ely clobbered Kreeger'.; 
one·year old standard With 59J~ 
pOints , while Bergman totallv 
obliterated the women's all-time 
best by nearly 1000 points. Her 56:37 
total was almost good enough to 
overtake Wilhert for the O\'er-all 
crown and was the third best score 
ever in the event. Kreeger's ;,)476 
accumulation was equally 
outstanding but not quite up to hi 
sterling !) 05 effort of 19 O. 

This week many of last year's top 
fini shers wi ll be back to challenge 
tho. e pesky tables again. But if 
history holds steady. none of them 
will be in the wmner's circle. 

Each year since 1978. a new 
com pet i tor or someone from far 
down the pre\'ious year's list has

come out of the proverbial 
woodwork to shock and impre sail. 

Wilbert did it last year after 
fini hing 17th in 1980. Kreeger 
came from nowhere that year a a 
sophomore to win going away, In 
1979 and 1978, Gil Ruiz and Jim 
enz performed a similar feat. In 

fact. ophomore and fre hman tend 
to do extremely well in this 4·day 
event that start s Thur. day. Each of 
the last four winners has had either 
ophomore or fre hman tatus.

The outing club heads Tennis team eyes championship for the great outdoors Ih P .\l 'L :\!\1BIWGIO 
BY ~\RRY GOLDMAN 

slarr Wriler 
This is the first in a series of 
ar ticl es exp loring UCSD 
Recreation Department clubs . 
Organizations, such as the 
ou ting, sailing and soaring 
clu bs, (lre the other, less-
publicized, part of the Rec 
Department which also YUl1S 
Intramural sports. 

The most one hears about a 
~ecreation club at CSO is an 
occasional ad about a movie it 
is sponsoring or a once a 
quarter visit to the club's tat:'e 
on ree club day. One never 
expect the clu bs to be written 
about in t he Guardian. 

Actually, there are many 
clubs that one might have an 
interest in if one knew about 
them. One of these is the 
outing club. Chuck Gormley , 
head of outdoor recreat ion and 
advi or to the club, said , "the 
UCSD Outing Club started in 
] 965 and i one of the oldest 
club on this campu ." 

Right now the club i 100 
me mb er' trong and, 
according to Gormley, is 
"totall y student -run ." The 
elu b has trips every weekend 
ranging from backpacking to 
cross·country skiing, and rock 
climbing to canoeing. Anyone 
IS welcome and encouraged to 
paricipate, eyen beginners. 

Those without any experi-
ence however would be well-
advised to take a c1as or trip 
spon 'ored by the outdoor ree 
department and Gormley. The 
rec department offers 
"eminars, movies and slide 

demons t ral ions about all 
types of ou tdoor recreat ion. 
plus specific trips structured 
for beginners. 

One excellent feature of the 
outdoor ree department is its 
equipment rental se rvice . 
Wilh help from theoutingclub 
and ot her outdoor activites on 
campus the inventory of 
equipment has a va lu e 
b('!ween $50.000 and $75,000. 
Almost any thing is available 
at about one· half the rental 
cost of normal sporting goods 
stores. Members of the outi ng 
elu b can rent equipment for 
half of that pri ce. 

Probably one of the most 
appealing aspects of the outing 
elu b is that it is very informal. 
They usually span or a day 
trip and weekend trip every 
week. but in most cases the 
trips are planned just the week 
before. What this means is 
that if member want to go 
somewhere, to get away for a 
day or for any reason. they can 
mention it at the meeting and 
will be virtually guaranteed of 
having a few members 
want ing to go along. 

This informality is just 
",hat the club wants, The 
meeting are not mandatory so 
a member can attend once a 
quarter or every week. The 
cos ts a member incur are 
minimal. All out ing club trip 
are run on a break-even ba i . 
Bas ically , one just pays for 
gas. food a nd rental 
equipment.
