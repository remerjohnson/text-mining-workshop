6.4 Richter Scale Quake 
Strikes San Diego Area 

By Ri .. Lee Podolsky 
Staff Writer 

An earthquake measuring 6.4 on 
the Richter scale centered near 
Calexico was felt over most of 
Southern California yesterday, causing 
damage at Calexico and E1 Centro. No 
major damage was reported at UCSD. 

The five·second tremor occurred at 
4: 16 pm yesterday and was felt as far 
away as Los Angeles, Phoenix, 
Arizona, and Lu Vegas, Nevada. The 
earthquake was on the Imperial 
faultline. 

At UCSD, books fell off shelves at 
Central Library, while students poured 
out the front door. At the tops of 
T enaya and Tioga dorms, students 

immedia~~y ran for the stairway. 
Anne -Minnich, an exchange' student 

from Dartmouth College in New 
Hampshire who has never been in an 
earthquake before, said, "I was talking 
to"'a friend on the 6th floor of T enaya, 
and she said, "I think we're having an 
earthquake.' I thought she was kidding 
but then I felt the floor shake, and I 
knew she wasn't." 

"Everyone else was more. scared 
than I was because I didn't know what 
was going on. People came running out 
of their rooms with panicked faces." 

Faculty Club 
On the Ropes 

By Kathy Huffer 
Auoc:iate News Editor 

Plans to locate a faculty club in the 
International Center, appear headed 
for the rocks due to opposition from the 
group of community members who 
helped build the center. 

• "I'm not optimistic ' about it at 
present," Dr. Pat Ledden, faculty club 
committee chairman said after recent 
negotiations with Friends of the 
University, which funded construction 
of the International Center.

There were about 60 injuries 
and one death reported in fJ Centro 
and Calexico. The earthquake toppled 
buildings and broke water mains near 
the quake's epicenter, about 125 miles 
from campus. 

And , Imperial County is in a 
countywide sate of emergency. 

High-rise buildings in Los Angeles 
and Las Vegas swayed, and there was 
a small landslide in San Diego's Balboa 
Park. . 

. The last major earth~ualce in San 
Diego was 6.0 on the Richter scale 
May 18, 1940. 

Bill Walton grants interviews 
freely nowadays, But one thing 
hasn't changed since Walton's 
recluse days in Portland - he still 
doesn't say anything to reporters. 

The Clippers' superstar center, 
political activist and press.dubbed 
prima donna consent to a Daily 
Guardian interview this weekend. 

At the urging of Adam, Walton 's 
three·year-old son, the interview was a 
short one, but it shows that he hasn't 
lot any of the sense of privacy which 
has made him almost as celebrated off 
the court CUI he is distinguished on it.

Minority Recruitment 
K.ey to UC' s Future, 
System Planners Say 
BERKELEY (AP) - The 

University of California must step up 
minority recruitment to avoid a sharp 
enrollment decline starting in the mid· 
1980s, says a university planning 
group. 

California 's 18-to-24 ·year-old 
population is expected to drop about 
15 percent between the mid· 1980s and 
the mid· 1990s before turning upward, 
said the group appointed by UC 
President David Saxon. 

It said the uni~ersity must try to 
avert a five to 15 percent enrollment 
decline in the 10 years starting about 
1985. 

None of the nine campuses will need 
to be closed, because enrollment is 
likely to rise above present levels in the 
late 1990s, said UC Vice President 
William Fretter, chairman of the 
group. 

Any enrollment decline will be 
aggravated "if we fail to bring larger 
numbers of fully qualified minority 
students into the university and do not 
reduce the presently high attrition rate 
for minorities," the group said in a 
report released yesterday. 

"The university must find better 
ways to meet the academic and 
personal needs of minority students." 

:According to state forecastl, the 
group said, minorities will make up 
about 55 p«:!,cent of California's public 

school enrollment by 1990. 
Currently, high school graduates 

who are eligible for UC include 5 
percent of black students 4.7 percent of 
Hispanics, 16.5 percent of Anglos and 
39 percent of Asians, the group said. 

It recommended that the university 
continue to admit only students from 
the top 12.5 percent of high school 
graduates, and increase efforts to 
encourage high. potential minority 
youngsters to take UC-required 
academic programs in high school. 

The university should try to meet the 
needs of older students, women 
returning to school, and part-time 
students, and should seek to maintain 
the vitality of liberal·arts 
undergraduate instruction "in the face 
of growing vocationalism," the group 
said. 

It also said UC's "strategic 
planning" should seek "to justify 
adequate state funding based on the 
essential role of the university in the 
1980s, and to persuade the state to 
maintain the funding level even if an 
enrollment decrease occurs. 

State demographic experts estimate 
that California will become the nation's 
first "Third World" state - i.e., the 
first state with a non·white majority -
by the turn of the century. 

Walton Talks, But Won't 
Say Much of Anything 

flag confronted me to the west, 
opposed by an American one of the 
east. And there was a little noise. 

"PAPA ... PA ... P A. ... .. PAPA!!!" 
"What'd ya need , Adam?" 
A rather bewildered three.year·old 

Adam Walton sat down to cogitate in 
the middle of a basketball court 
cunningly disguised as a site for a 
gymnastics meet. 

Undaunted , the slightly annoyed 
reported from Seattle continued his 
interrogation. His subject is staring 
listlessly at the ceiling. He rolls his 
eyes. Jumps up and down. Bends. And 
dodges both his son, who is trying to 
climb the mountain of his father, and 
the man who is trying to interview him. 

Walton is doing a number on the 
fellow from Seattle. He used to avoid 
reporters altogether. He's talking now, 
but his listlessness shows that inside he 
is singing "The Establishment Blues." 

Mv turn finally came. The interview 
which ensued needs no clarification: 

Guardian: How are you feeling Bill 
- How's your foot? 

Walton: Sore 
G: Then you're not going to play 

tonight? 
W: Nope. 
G: Are you going to play Tuesday in 

Portland? 
W: Don't know. 

C: As you know, Bill , I'm from UCSD 
- this is going to be read by lot of 
college students who will want to know 
about your college career - they 
probably have read stuff .. . 

W: College was great. 

G: What do you mean? Can you be 
more specific? 

W: College was fun , it was exciting. 
College provided some of the best 
times of my life. . 

C: But what about your Protesting 
the Viet Name? What about the Nixon 
deal? (Walton at one point called upon 
the people of the United States to stand 
with him in his rejection of the 
government) Didn't all of the publicity 
comp~cate your ~fe? 

W: I don't know. 
C. Were you allowed to lead a

W: What is normal?

In YOW" article "Internships Valuable Career Experience" 
(Oct. 5), there are two important misrepresentations of the facts. 

Gary Frost i. ~rted as saying, "there are no applied 
programs at UCSD. ' the article continues by .tating, "Warren 
wi118pOnIOI' aD programs that involve practical applications." 
Both 01 theae aIlegationa are at variance with our activities ...

component in the URS major for several years. Student 
placements have been made in. a ~ty of local, state and 
placements have been made in a variety of local, state and 
national settings. 

Whae we have not had anyone observing monkey behavior in 
the Vir"n Islands, we have had students in nearly 100 local 
agencies gaining applied, professional experience in 
decisionmaking, health care, planning, human development, 
lOciai ecology, land use and other areas with career 
implications. 

Students have also had placements with government officials 
... Sacramento, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. Urban and 
Rural Studies graduates are serving society as attorneys, social 
aervice agency cirectors, union representatives, as well as in 
numerous planning and human care occupations. 

FJeld placement is a requirement of the URS major. quality of 
the experience is maintained by one person of the URS Course 
group who not only provides dassroom instruction but also 
serves in a consultative manner with the SUperVising agency 
personnel. Having worked with Gary Frost also, you can 
imagine our .urprise to learn that programs with practical 
implications were under Warren's internship.

Why would such a place be 
dosed? According to lArry 
Barrett. director of hQusing 
and food services, the shop 
was closed because of 
operational and financial . 
problems. He explained the · 
quality was inconsistent, and 
that to alleviate the problem a 
fuD time cook would have to be 
hired, making the operation 
too expensive. 

For that reason the shop 
was closed so other options 
could be explored. Barrett . 
says the ~nt Teriyaki 
Shop is a temporary measure . 

We find these arguments to 
• be hardly persuasive. The 

operation of the taco shop was 
a very straightforward and 
profitable operation. The shop 
flourished. As fas as quality 
consistency is concerned, 
among the taco shop's regular 
customers there was not a 
complaint to be heard. ,A 
(letition placed in the 
Rathskeller for two days 
collected over 50 names of 
customers wanting the return 
of the taco shop. 

The campus food facilities 
are here to serve a very 
specific clientele, namely, 
students, faculty and staff. It is 
the job, and should be the 
intention of food facility 
management, to cater to this 
s~ific_c1ientel~ ~ 

The closing of the taco shop 
displayed a lack ot such an 
intention.

Religion Fi lling -Void 
By Rasa Guataitis 

While the West 's 
leading religious figure, 
Pope John Paul 11 toured 
this country, the United 
States also was host to the 
Dalai Lama, leader in the 
East 's great religion , 
Buddhism. Rasa Custaitis 
comments on the signifi -
cance of these two 
extraordinary simultane-
ous visits. ' Custaitis is an 
editor of Pacific News 
Service. 

trom a future vantage 
point, the fall of 1979 may 
well be remembered as that 
moment in history when a 
massive but unexpected 
revival of religion meshed 
with a deep and grdwing 
yearning for new 'leaders ' 
with great visions_ 

The historical moment is 
the simultaneous visit to this 
country of the Fourteenth 
Dalai Lama of Tibet, 
incarnation of 1,000 years 
of Buddhist teaching, and 
of Pope John Paul II , leader 

"of Roman Catholicism, the 
most powerful sector of 
Christianity. &th come 

from.~'!lall.£Quntri~~ w_here 
their faith is under siege DY 
a Marxist government 
installed in the wake of 
invasion by a powerful 
neighbor - the Soviet 
Union in Poland, China in 
Tibet - and where atheism 
is official doctrine. 

&th represent traditions 
that, after centuries of 
tenacious isolation, are 
reaching now beyond their 
traditional constituencies 
toward a planet . wide 
peacemaker role. 

The great religions which 
the Dalai lAma and the 
Pope represent both have 
been compelled to break 
out of their longestablished 
frames and are now 
undergoing major revival . 
They have been revived at 
the grass root level by 
adversity even while their 
formal institutions ap-
peared to have ossified or 
atr~phied. 

Until Pope John Paul II, 
the per.slenee 01 Italian 
popes had made the 
Catholic church seem 
almost quaint in a world 
that not only had long 
ceased to center in Rome 
but did not even divide any 
more into East and West. 
The church seemed to have 
lost the ability to respond to 
demands for change. 

In Soviet-dominated 
countries, the faith was kept 
alive by being forced to 
struggle for survival as an 

. underground- religion. As 
part of that struggle, 
Catholics had forged an 
alliance with the broader 
human rights movement · 
personfied here by the 
celebrated dissidents. 

In the Americas, 
meanwhile , priests and 
nuns were lea ving the life of 
the cloth in unprecedented 
nwnbers and convents and 

. seminaries failed to draw 
enough .ucce.soJl to fiD the 
needs of church institutions,. 

- So laymen were traineo ' 
by the religious to lead 
congregations. In the 
procell. they began to 

democratize the monarchal 
church. Many of them were 
lAtin American villagers 
who put the Christian 
message into action against 
tyrannical governments , on 
behalf of land reform , 
decent wages and protec-
tionnatural resources. 

Nuns and priest dressed 
in ordinary garb now also 
mingle in North and South 
American communities, 
working with others as 
organizers for social justice. 
And thoug Pope John Paul 
II has 
organizers for social justice. 
And though Pope John 
Paul II has demanded they 
go back to traditional 
vestments , it is unlikely they 
will retrea t. 

Meanwhile, the theologi-
cal underpinnings for the 
change already underway 
were being constructed. 
The German theOiogiim, 
Karl Rahrier, it quiet but 
powerful influence, even 
allowed recently that the 
Holy See might some day 
find it appropriate to move . 
to, for instance, the 

~iIIippines . 
The Dalai Lama comes 

from a tradition that is not 
nearly so familiar in this 
country, and his visit has 
therefore received far less 
attention. But Buddhism in 
several forms in increasing-
ly influential in the United 
States, and it is also in 
process of a revival that, 
like the Catholic revival, is 
partly catalysed by . 
adversity . 

Buddhist teachers have 
flocked here in response to 
invitationa 

Buddhist teachers have 
flocked here in response to 
invitations from Westerners 
eager to study with them. 
Among them are teachers 
and Jamas displaced from 
Mongolia, Tibet, China, 
and other lands where 
Buddhist practice has been 

su~pressed . 
Lamas who would 

otherwise have spent their 
lives in monasteries of the 
tiny country near the roof of 
the world are now scattered 
as far as Alaska, 
Switzerland, Scotland and 
in American cities . They 
have established study and 
meditation centers and 
drawn students who find 
that their teachings 
resonate with discoveries in 
physics, biology and 
psychology . 

When the Dalai Lama 
toured the United States , he 
was sometimes treated as 
an exotic dignitary from a 
strange culture. But he was 
also welcomed by a 
sizeable constituency that 
perceived him as a leader in 
a ph~osophy and way of life 
that speaks to the deepest 
and most subtle concerns of 
the modern human 
predicament. 

uke Catholicism and 
Buddhism, many other 
major institutions have 
petrified and become 
inadequale for the vast 
changes sweeping the 
planet.

a, L,nette Tom 

Senior Staff Writer 
Murplly's Law, the notion 

that anything that · can go 
wrong, will, is the underlying 
philosophy in Valerie Curtin's 
and Barry Levinson's 
screenplay And Jrutice For 
All, the tale of a Ietal world 
that's taken apparent leave of 
ill senses. 

alumnus personifies insanity 
itself. 

In the supporting cast, Lee 
Strasberg lends a poignant 
performance as Kirkland's 
convalescent home-confined 
grandfather, Sam, and 

Chriltine Lahti makes the best 
of her screen debut as 
Kirkland's lawyer gidfriend, 
Gail Packer. 

NOf!l!.an Jewison's directiQ!l 
of And Justice For All is 
choppy. He' starts off by 
building successive anecdotes 
that elicit easy laughter from 
the viewers. Then, to make 
sure that they do not take the 
film a. a total spoof, Jewison . 
jerks them back into proper 

perspective with an unexpec-
ted twist. These serious 
moments have a tendency to 
be a shade too melodramatic. 
The viewers may still respond 
to them with anger, sadness 
and surprise, but the twists 
become tiresome. 
. The ending, while dramatic, 

is never carried through, and 
this leaves viewers feeling 
shortchanged . 

The curious thing about 
Columbia's And Justice For 
All is that the comparison of 
the legal world as it is depicted 
on the screen to that of real life 
is not all that implausible. The 
motion picture will be 
released at the Cinema 21 
Theater on October 19. 

Tueeday,Oet.16,1979 

Attempting to rise above 
the bureaucracy isabrashand 
impul.ive lawyer named 
Arthur Kirkland who is willing 
to risk his twelve years of 

~e on the Bar in order to 
put a little justice back into the 
courts. His task isn't easy, 
since he has to deal with a 
judge who likes to eat lunch on 
the Iedlfe of a tall building and 
uses a gavel and a gun 

intercbaDf~'kIY • to .bring the 
court ·to or_; • partner who 
shaves his head and throws 
plates at passersby after his 
dient resumes killing; and 
another judge who is as 
verbaUy abusive to litigants as 
he is physically abusive to 
young women ever.yday. 
Against these odds Kirkland 
does break out, with a five 
minute appeal to the jurors 
that has viewers in an uproar 
of applause, cheers and 
whistles. 

'New Wave' Not For 'Clash': They Play Punk 

AI Pacino's characteriza-
tion of Arthur Kirkland is no 
disappointment to those 
families with his work. Jack 
Warden is memorable .s 
Judge Rayford, this character, 
(to say he is "touched" is a 
definite understatement,) 
makes a nice contrast to his 
television appearances as 
Coach Buttermaker on The 
Bad News Bears. John 
Forsythe may esixt only as a 
disembodied voice in Charlie's 
Angels, but he is shown full 
figure in And Justice For All. 
His portrayal of the inflexible, 
tyrannical Judge Fleming is 
thoroughly and appropriately 
detestable. Why Jeffrey 
Tambor would ever stoop to

The San Old Globe 

By Barry Alfonso 
Contributing Editor 

Generally speaking, 
anybody who was anybody in 
San Diego rock fandom turned 
out to see the Clash at Golden 
Hall the evening of October 
10th. It was one of the social 
events of the year for those 
stalwarts who have been 
willing to brave the abuse of 
more conventional rock fans 
for being ahead of their time in 
their pop music tastes. Abnosl 
a sense of duty must've 
impelled many to see the Clash 
show, the lor.g -awaited 
concert bl one of the first 
bona-fide British punk outfits. 
To their credit, the group 
responded to the expectant 
mood and delivered for their 
fans. 

When the Sex Pistols 
disbanded last year, it seemed 
as it that band took the term 
"punk rock" with them. The 
currently fashionable label for 
simplified, hard-driving rock 
these days in "new wave," a 
blander and less provocative 
name. Yet the Clash were and 
struggle to remain true punks, 
aggressive, sometimes 
desperat~ kids out to vent their 
frestrations on the world. 
Unlike t ei-r American 
counterparts, .the Clash refl~l

a young audience With real, 
immediate grievances against 
their society, burdened with 
chronic unemployment and a 
growing fascist movement. If 
all this sounds terribly serious, 
it should be remembered that 
the Clash are entertainers 
forst, social 
remembered that the Clash are 
social entertainers first , social 
commentators second. Their 
sound is insistent, ear-
assaulting and, if you're willing 
to surrender it, an involving 
experience. 

While the musically hep of 
our town. were eager to hear 
the foursome from the U.K., 
most San Diegans still prefer 
more tranquil rock acts -
Golden Hall was far from filled 
last Wednesday. flaunting 
their outsider status, 'many of 
the attendees that night were 
dolled up in their most garish 
thrift shop wear: black 
raincoats, purple feather boas, 
miniskirts, silken Japanese 
jackets and more exotic 
regalia lent a bit of an early 
Halloween l1lQod to the Clash 
show. Never mind that the 

. Clash themselves dress as 
austerely as possible - their 
concert was an event and the 
atmosphere was festive. 

The impatient ticket-holders 
were not too keen on sitting 
through two opening acts 

4th Annual 

before the headliners appeared 
on stage, ' giving an especially. 
cold shoulder to the Standbys, 
a local quintet at the bottom of 
the bill. I've seen these guys 
before, and my opinion of 
them remains unchanged: 
pretentious, derivative (the 
lead singer thinks he's the 
Johnny Rotten-I'm-so-pissed-
off type) and dull. The 
following group, a rockabilly 
band called the Rebels, were a 
pleasant surprise. They 
managed to inject considera-
ble humor and spunk into an 
antiquated rock style, 
basically the blues played with 
a country twang by slicked-up 
cowboys with sideburns. 

When the Clash strode into 
the spotlights like terrorists 
about t!> hijack an airliner, a 
good portion of the audience 
moved to the front of the hall to 
engage in some free-form 
pogo dancing. this is definitely 
the best way to respond to Ihe 
band. Because singer Jow 
Strummer's mumbled 
Cockney-accented vocals are 
difficult to decipher over 
guitarist Mick Jones' electric 
din (a problem compounded 
that night by sound system 
foul-ups), reflective listening to 
the Clash's music is out of the

The thing to do instead is to 
plunge into a mob of sweating 
fanatics , brace yourself 
against shoving and attempt to 
leap up and down (head-
tossing optional) as rapidly as 
you can. The Clash's brain-
bashing rhythm section fairly 
demands this sort of behavior. 

While I would judge the 
Clash's show a success on its 
own terms, the nature of the 
band's music had its 
drawbacks for me. To my 
mind, the best rock and roll 
tunes build up to a peak, 
flattening the listener with a 
pent-up climatic surge of raw 
power - songs like the 
Stones' "Midnight Rambler" 
or the Velvet UnderAl'ound's 

" Heroin" are examples of this. 
The Clash's ' songs, however, 
in most cases are all peak, 
performed at the same h'igh 
level of intensity throughout, 
which sometimes can be 
effective but at other times 
only serves to dull the senses . 
Tunes like "Garageland" and 
"Safe European Home" are 
undeniable strong stuff, but I'd 
like to see more musical 
texture and variance in the 
Clash's material.

Satellite Monitor Here 

Scripps Views Sea' from Sky 
By Lisa Pieropan 

Scripps scientists have 
begun operation of the nation's 
first satellite monitoring station 
capable of collecting oceanic 
and atmospheric data on a 
global basis. 

To be located at Scripps 
institute of Oceanography , the 
monitoring equipment adds an 
"extremely powerful tool" to 
the field of oceanography, said 
Dr. Robert L. Bernstein, chief 
scientist and principal 
investigator for the Scripps 
satellite receiving station. 

The Scripps facility is 
tracking and collecting data 
from three satellites, NOAA-6 
and TIROS-N, the first two of 
eight in a series of new 
meterological satellite 
operated by the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration; and NASA's 
N 1MB U.S - 7, the fir s t 

unmanned satellite to provide 
color ocean images. The three 
satellites are capable of 
scanning the earth with a 
variety of sensory devices , 
including visible, infrared, 
microwave and unltraviolet 
wavelengths. 

According to Bernstein, the 
TIROS-N and NOAA-6 use 
visible and infrared scanners 
on sea surface temperature 
and atmospheric conditions to 
analyze fog and cloud cover, 
storm circulation , ocean 
surface a nd atmospheric 
temperature , Arctic and 
Anarctic ice activity, and 
humidity condition. They are 
also equipped with a data 
collection system to receive 
transmissions from buoys 
floating on the ocean surface, 
providing the needed accuracy 
of t/2 to 1 degree centigrade for 
surface-truth temperatures . 

The NIMBUS-7 space-

craft which is of great Interest 
to physical oceanographers, 
provides information on 
surface temperatures, water 
vapor and wind speed, as well 
as using color imagery 
equipment to supply data on 

. chlorophll levels - a . vital 
factor in determining . the 
biological productivity of an 
area. 

The applications of satellite 
oceanography are wide-
spread. Plotting atmospheric 
analysis aids in long range 
weather forecasting and short 
term to to three month climate 
prediction, as well as better 
forecasts of wind and wave 
condition. 

Examining and following 
the thermal climates 
associated with certain species 
of fish can enhance fishery 
information, while studying 
the various seal color shades 
correlated with different

This inf"lI.r • ..t 
data collected by NOAA-6 satellite on Sept. 19 was pvduc:ed 
by the new Satellite-Oceanography Facility at Scrippi Institute. 
The infrared radiations indicate temperature variances on earth 
and ocean surfaces. 

chlorophyll levels helps locate 
biological breeding.,grounds. 

Also measuring surface 
temperatures and thermal 
properties of the upper oceans 
can show the eddies needed to 
improve invulnerability in anti-
submarine warfare. 

Monitoring surface 
temperatures can also verify 
the extent of oil and other 
ocean pollution, because of the 
surface temperature change 
associated with oil on ocean 
water. "More applications will 
evolve as scientists learn new 
methods of data processing 
and as new instrumentation is 
developed and put into space," 
Bernstein stated. 

Satellite information has 
been available to oceanogra-
phers in the past, but only 
weeks or months after it has 
been received at tracking 
stations elsewhere . The 
Scripps facility will give 
scientists a crude first hand 
look at the data as it is 
received, and will record it to 
be processed and analyzed for 
use in the laboratory, or 
transmitted for use on ocean-
stated research vessels . 

The Scripps Satellite-

Oceanography facility 
consists of a movable five 
meter (16.5 foot) diameter 
parabolic dish antenna on a 
nine meter (30 foot) base, and 
a building housing several 
systems of advanced 
computer equipment with 
sophisticated image display 
systmes capable of adding 
color to satellite pictures. 

The computer systems, 
recording data in the form of 
video displayed pictures 
similar to weather maps, are 
able to handle 700,000 pieces 
of information per second. 
'Hundreds of millions of 
information pieces are 
recorded in the 10 minutes a 
satellite passes from horizon. 
The computers can also 
receive and process data from 
other parts of the world. 

According to Dr. William 
A. Nierenberg, director of 
Scripps Institute, "the use of 
satellites offers the possibility 
of collecting data at a rate that 
is Gterally impossible utilizing 
.research vessels. Some 
regions are inaccessible and 
ship operation costs are too 
weat for cruises to the vast 
areas that can be monitored by 
satellites ...

Faculty Club Dead? 
Continued (rom I'Glle I 

Calling McElroy's summer 
announcement that a club would move 
there was "premature," Ledden says 
ICheduling problems with the center 
are the primary obstacle to placing a 
lunch·time facility for faculty and staff 
there. 

And Ledden says he is not even sure 
if faculty members still want _a !a;~ty 
club. "It's a different story now, he 
says, explaining that the new student 
center pub may satisfy the faculty's 
interest in a non-cafeteria setting. 

But before a decision will be made 
on housing a faculty club in the 
international center, Ledden, both 
assistant chancellor and a math 
professor, will consult with the 
Academic Senate next Tuesday, as 
"this should be a faculty club, not a 
chancellor's club," he says. . 

With the -Coffee Hut controversy 
over, the search for a new location for a 
faculty club has been quiet. Ledden 

says he would like to see a club begun 
by the end of winter quarter, but "it 
depends on how creative we are." 

The faculty club committee will m~~t 
later next week to discuss the senate's 
sentiments on the club, according to 
Ledden. If the committee decides 
against establishing a club in the 
international center, few options will 
remain for another location, Ledden 
says.
