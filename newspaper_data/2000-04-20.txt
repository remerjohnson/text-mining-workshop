A.S. President 
Admits to 
Forging Receipts 
Committee is currently 
investigating New York trip 
taken by A.S. executives 

By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

Members of the A.S. Council began meet-
ing Tuesday to discuss allegations of wrong-
doing by executive council members in rela-
tion to a leadership-conference trip to ew 
York City. At Wednesday's council meeting. 
A.S. President Tesh Khullar admitted to falsi-
fying receipts connected to the trip. 

Khullar said he ac epts responsibility for 
his actions. 

"If 1 did something wrong, then I will 
take the blame for it: Khullar said. "I am 
willing to accept the consequences if they 
choose to do that: 

The trip to New York was taken by exec-
utive council members Khullar, Vice 
President Internal Jennifer Lee, Vice 
President Finance Eric Rovner and Vice 
President External Terrence Patterson. 

The members spent approximately 
$5,400 of student funds to attend the week-
long conference, said Warren Senior 
Senator Kevin McGinnis. 

Khullar said he would give a full repon 
regarding the allegations at next 
Wednesday'S A.S. Council meeting after the 
special committee to investigate the trip has 
reached its final decision. 

"There were some receipts that we 
turned in that were not authentic," he sa id . 
"I don't think we should discuss specifics 
until the repon comes out." 

The A.S. president said he promises to 
cooperate with the committee, as all stu-
dents have the right to know how the A.S. 
Council 's money is spent. 

"I have no problem establishing this 
committee: he said. "We are not going to 
hide anything from anyone:

UCSO. 

The screening of seven classic silent films -
directed by such luminaries as O.w. Griffith, 
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton - will begin

UCSD Outreach Pr ..... 
Receives National R8COfn1tlon 

La Clase Magica, an outreach program at 
UCSO, has been selected as a winner of this 
year 's La Promesa de un Futuro Brillante Award 
by the National Latino Children'S Institute. 

La Clase Magica is one of 21 programs 
throughout the country to be honored as the 
most innovative and outstanding programs for 
Latino youth. The award winners will be guests 
of honor at a weekend celebration April 29 and 
30 at Epeot Center in Orlando, Fla. 

Olga Vasquez, founder of La Clase Magica. 
said seven to 10 children, parents and staff mem-
bers will attend La Promesa de un Futuro Brillante 
gala in Florida. Events for the winners on April 29 
will include tours for youth on technology and 
communication, conservation and environment 
and world cultures. There will also be youth lead-
ership and advocacy training. On April 30 a parade 
proclaiming Elora de los Ninos - Celebrating 
Young Americans - will be open for participation 
by all children and youth at Epeot . 

La Clase Magica serves Latino youth in an 
innovative way with a computer-based curricu-
lum. It academically and socially prepares chil-
dren and adolescents to succeed in school and 
within the community. 

La Clase Magica was adapted to the educa-
t ional and social needs of a bilingual and bicul-
tural audience. 

Last August, La Clase Magica was one of a 
number of projects working with Latino youths 
recognized by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at 
a gathering of project leaders at the White House. 

The National Latino Children's Institute, 
based in Austin, Texas, is a national, nonprofit 
organization that creates a voice for Latino 
youth. Its miSSion is to promote and implement 
the National Latino Children's Agenda, a com-
prehensive statement of principles for the com-
plete and healthy development of young Latinos. 

In the April 17 article, 'Independent Slate Sweeps A.S. Election," Doc Khaleghi was incorrectly iden-
tified as the founder of the Independent Slate. Marshall Sophomore Senator Jeff Dodge actually 
foontjed the slate. 
In the April 17 article, "UCSD Welcomes New Admlttees to Campus" Mr. Francois Jimenez' gender 
was incorrectly identified.

"It is not like we spent this 
money on personal things.' he said. 
"We didn't have all the receipts 
because we just didn't keep them." 

Warren Freshman Senator jesse 
Coward, who is chairing the inves-
tigative committee, said he is 
pleased that the four executives are 
cooperatin~ with the formation of 
this commIttee and its investigation. 

"There were no attempts to 
deny or bury anything; he said. "[ 

Strike: 
T As marched through 
Price and Student centers 

charged the university with unilat-
erally changing TA working condi-
tions, bargaining in bad faith. 
refusing to provide critical infor-
mation, delaying bargaining and 
practicing regressive bargaining. 
The unions filed their charge with 
the California Public Employment 
Relations Board. 

The unions also stated that the 
university has failed to provide 
information with respect to work-
load, health benefits and fee remis-
sions, and that it has violated the 
law by malting changes to hours, 
workJoad, summer programs and 
job descriptions without negotiat-
ing with the union. 

The university released a state-
ment Tuesday saying that a strike 
may detract from the negotiation 
process. 

"We do not understand the need 

appreciate that there were no signs 
of anything to hide." 

Regardless. Khullar said the 
committee may suggest a Judicia[ 
Board trial for the alfeged offenses. 

·Legally I guess it could go back 
to the university if that is [its] pre-
rogative: he said. "If there are fur-
ther ramifications, then fine.' 

Khullar said Judicia[ Board pun-
ishment could range from having 
the executive council pay back the 
money from the forged receipts to 
completing community service. 

Khullar added that he is still 
uncertain about what the punish-
ment for the executive council will 
be. 

Many senators feel the formation 
of the investigative committee is an 

for a strike given the progress that 
has been occurring: the university 
stated. "A strike will not influence 
the university'S negotiating position 
and can only be a distraction from 
the real process of achieving a con-
tract. Furthermore, the union's 
accusations of unfair labor practices 
by the university are unfounded." 

UCSD TAs picketed at the 
Gilman information booth all day 
Tuesday. At noon, over 70 TAs 
brought their protest through cam-
pus, marching through the Price 
Center and Student Center before 
returning to Gilman Drive. 

The union called a strike earlier 
this month and then postponed it 
after an agreement was made 
between the union and the univer-
sity to enter into a three-week 
mediation period. 

Part of the settlement was an 
agreement for the university to 
send a letter to administrators 
explaining the labor law to them 
and how it has changed since the 
university began recognizing the 
TA unions last year.

TA, said the letter did not inform 
administrators about direct dealing. 
Direct dealing refers to instances 
when the university deals with a 
hand-picked group of TAs instead 
of the union representatives. 

Hyatt said that while the strike 
may harm undergraduates for one 
day, it has a greater purpose. 

"Obviously it is going to hurt 
the students, but [the university] 
breaking the law is hurting stu-
dents much more than th is one-
day strike: she said. 

Michae[ Hughes, a UCSD TA in 
the linguistics department, said he 
would like to see a quick resolution 
to the problem. 

"What we'd like to see is the 
university stop breaking the law. 
We'd like to see them adhere to the 
labor law and bargain in good 
faith: he said. MWe don't want to 
hun undergraduates and we want 
to see these things resolved in a 
civilized manner." 

According to both the TAs and 
the university, the mediation period 
that both parties agreed to was 
supposed to run through Tuesday.

Low Voter Turnout 
Due to Online Voting 

Voter turnout for UCSD's past election 
was lower than usual, coming in at just over 
20 percent, as opposed to the average stu-
dent turnout of 2S percent in past years. 
Although the low turnout may be attributed 
to m.any causes, such as apathy regarding 
candidates and a larger student population, 
the primary reason for lower voter turnout 
was the online voting process and the way it 
was implemented. 

Voting online is much easier and more 
accessible than having the traditional bal-
lot tables set up around campus. However, 
in past years, prominent voting booths in 
key locations such as Peterson Hall and 
the Price Center helped to encourage stu-
dents to vote in previous years. Students 
c?uldn 't e~ter a classroom without seeing 
Visual reminders that an election was tak-
ing place. In addition, students who voted 

i~ pas~ ele~tions received a reward for par-
ticipating In the political process - a free 
soda at the Price Center. 

This year, there was a single voting 
booth .set up with iBooks on Library Walk, 
but thiS proved to be too little to motivate 
students to vote, especially amidst the 
overpowering vendor fair that was also tak-
ing place on Library Walk. Moreover, there 
was no free soda for the students who 
might have needed such an incentive to 
vote, and some students missed the physi-
cal satisfaction of simply punching holes 
for the candidates they supported . 
Furthermore, other students may have 
been disturbed by the fact that their vote 
may be associated with their identification 
number, though this is necessary to prevent 
voter fraud online. 

The election could have been better han-
dle? and voter turnout increased by having 
voung booths set up as usual around cam-
pus (in addition to having the online voting 
option available at computer labs and home 
computers). It is clear that the future of stu-
dent elections is online voting, due in no 
small part to its ease of use and flexibility. 
H?wever, it would have been more appro-
priate to phase in this new form slowly 
r~ther. than jumping in head-first and get-
ting nd of the old, established venues of

'Californians Must Give Up Their Love of 
the Car if Mass Transit is to Succeed 

'-:utomobiles have revolutionized modem society, but the growth of urban centers makes 
zt clear that the age of public, not private, transportation is desperately needed 
By SIMONI SANTINI 
5t af( Writer 

The idea for this article was formed 
on a crowded Friday afternoon while sit-
ting with what seems to amount to half 
the population of San Diego at the inter-
section of Sorrento Valley Boulevard and 
Sorrento Valley Road, along with several 
murderous thoughts directed at whoever 
designed said intersection. 

It takes a ' criminal mind to pack 
together a major intersection between 
the only two streets leading in or out of 
a burgeoning industrial area, a slow 
cycling, eight-way traffic light, a rail-
road crossing, and a freeway entrance 
and exit. 

It is only in situations like this, in 
which traffic is at a standstill and we pro-
ceed at the fantastic speed of two miles 
per h.our, .that ~n has t~e time to analyze 
the SItuation wIth relative calm (barring, 
of course, the aforementioned murder-
ous t~o~ghts). lfsually one is too busy 
negotlatmg one s way around drivers 
with the reflexes of lemurs who can find 
no other way to assert themselves other 
than hurling 4,000 pounds of iII-con-
trolled steel down a public road. These 
vehicles are ill-controlled due to the fact 

~hat their drivers always seem busy talk-
I~g on the phone, reading, writing, sip- . 
ping coffee - all benign activities, 
exccpt, that is, by a person behind the 
wheel of a moving vehicle. 

Nowhere is the silly proliferation of 
overweight, ?versized sport-utility vehi-
cles more eVIdent than from within a lit-
tle Volkswagen Golf. 

As the traffic crawls and grinds to a 
halt, the train of thought wanders from 
its first object to the absurdity of the fact 
that hundreds of people are using an 
equal number of cars to travel a few 
miles inside an urban area. No one 
sho.uld be sitting ~ere. in a car trying to 
aVOId bad drivers In bIg cars while their 
blood pressure goes up. Commuters 

Sooner or later, every 
technology reaches the limits 
of its sustainable 

developmen~ and the car-
oriented city is rapidly 
reaching its limit, 
should be sitting in a subway, a train or a 
bus reading a book on the way home -
or perhaps engaged in casual conversa-
tion with strangers who, after months of 
carpooling together, would become old 
friends, shaking their heads philosophi-
cally as they discuss the evils of the 
world. 

This lack of efficient public trans-
portation is, if you think about it dispas-
s~onately, rather strange. After all, mas-
sIve urban transportation by private 
vehicl~ is more. expensive, dangerous, 
polluting and - If my experiences are at 
all typical - a more lonely, tiring and 
altogether stressing experience than a 
trai n or bus ride. 
. Things are not going to improve any 

time soon. Sooner or later, every tech-
nology reaches the limits of its sustain-
able development, and the car-oriented 
city is rapidly reaching its limit. This is 
not due to a defect or flaw in the auto-
mobile per se, but simply to the fact that 
successful technologies often transform 
the society into which they are inserted 
in such a way that the technology 
becomes obsolete. America today is no 
longer the country it was in 1910, the 
year in which the automobile was suc-
cessfully introduced. This is due, in no 
small measure, to the impact of the car 
itself. 

What makes things complicated in 
this circumstance is that cars have had a 
tremendous impact not only on the 
structure of our cities, but on the nature 
and role of businesses, the way people 
work and are entertained, courtship ritu-

als, generation conflicts and religion. 
Changmg the role of the car will be 
dif~icult because it entails changing our 
attltu~e t?ward all these things. 

ThIs IS why the recent $5 .2 billion 
tra~spo~ation plan outlined by 
~ahfornJ~ Gov .. Gr~y Dav~s is encourag-

~ng yet dIsappOinting. It IS encouraging 
In the political realization that public 
tran'porta"n is im urgent issue that 
should be confronted without further ' 
~elay. The government has a pivotal role 

I~ the deve.lopment of private transporta-
!ton by uSing tax money to build roads 

~nd freeways, and every signal of its will-
Ingness to playa role in a more extensive 
use of public transportation is welcome. 

. The plan. is disappointing in that it 
falls to conSIder the widespread ripples 
that the car's changing role will send 
throughout society. As it is often the 
case, ~avis' plan looks for a simple tech-

nol?$lca~ fix . to a problem with deep 
pohtlcallmphcations. 

This doesn't mean that technological 
and logistic improvements are not 

im~ortant. There is no reason why the 
United States should continue trailing 
other in~ustrialized countries in high-

spee~ trains, for example, especially con-
SIdering that a 200 mph train is more 
convenient and economical than a plane 
for most travel within California (e.g. on 
a San Diego to San Francisco trip). Yet, 
only $5 million has been allocated for a 
preliminary study of a high-speed coastal 
rail link (local rails are doing better, with 
about $800 million allocated). 
. In .this sense, Davis' plan is too timid, 

hngenng too much on the perpetuity of 
the car ($275 million for new freeway 
lanes), and in the much more fundamen-
tal way of not considering the depth to 
which a serious reform of OUr trans-
portation model will affect society (no 
money has been proposed for Iqng-term 
urban development projects).

Admit · Day Misrepresents UCSD 
The carnival atmosphere that prospective students are exposed 
to upon visiting this campus is not indicative of real life 
Opinion Editor 

Another Admit Day has come and gone, 
and I feel ashamed. I feel ashamed of myself 
and my peers and my school. 

All these naive, ambitious high school 
seniors come to UCSD to try to decide whether 
they should spend the next four (or five, or six) 
years of their life here, not to mention spending 
tens of thousands of dollars of their (or their 
parents', or the government's) money for the 
privilege. Choosing a college is perhaps the 
most important decision anyone could ever 
make. Because of this fact, all the admittees 
invest a great deal of time in researching their 
choices to try to make the right decision. 

What do we - the people who found our-
selves standing on this exact same threshold 
not long ago - do for these hopeful aspirants? 
We lie to them. 

We lead them down a Library Walk that is 
packed with student organizations trying to sell 
the school to all these high school tourists. We 
tell them that UCSD is a great place to get 
politically involved and active in the communi-
ty; ~ we can't even get 25 percent of the stu-
dent body to tum out for a student election. We 
tell them there are plenty of outlets to celebrate 
different cultures and backgrounds at UCSD, 
even while diversity has been slowly dying at 
this campus. 

We take them off campus to party and/or 
get them drunk (I can't even begin to count 
how many violations of Admit Day policy are 
contained in that one sentence ... it's probably 
best not to think about it), knowing full well 
that parties at UCSD are hard to come by. 

These kids don't know any of this. They 
don't know what it's ~lIy like here the rest of 
the school year. They come ~ campus for a 
couple of days and see a bunch of college stu-
dents having a good time and being dedicated. 
How are they supposed to know this isn't the 
way things always are? 

Once the pre-froshes are all gone, the 

booths are packed up and neglected once 
again. Everyone goes back to the usual hum-
drum of campus life. This is when pre-froshes 
should really come and visit; during midterms 
and finals when the pressure is really on and 
they can see exactly what going to school here 
actually entai Is. 

When the pre-froshes we tricked during 
Admit Day come to school in the fall they're 
going to feel angry and betrayed. They're going 
to hunt down the students who hosted them in 
the spring, grab them by the throat and shake 
them mercilessly while they yell: "What the hell 
happened to this place? Ever since I enrolled 
here all I've seen people do is study and camp 
in front of their computers. You told me you 
guys believed in things! You told me you par-
tied! You told me you guys were cool! How 
could you lie to me like that?" 

The only response the offending student 
will have to offer is: "Hey, relax. The next Admit 
Day is only two quarters away, then we can take 
out the next batch of pre-froshes and party 
with them the same way we did with you: 

Admit Day is just a carnival. Everything that 
is good about UCSD is packed into a circus 
tent and paraded before the unassuming eyes 
of the next generation of UCSD students. They 
don't know how hard it is to find al\ of these 
opportunities during the course of the normal 
school year. Admit Day doesn't represent the 
vast majority of the student body, the hoards 
who don't get involved in student organiza-
tions or try to participate the least bit in cam-
pus life. 

I'm not going to say there isn't anything to 
be proud of at UCSD because that is obvious-
ly false. I can't help but wonder at the morality 
of misrepresenting ourselves to the rest of the 
world just for the sake of recruiting for the uni-
versity. If applicants really want to see what 
UCSD is like, they should come here on their 
own during the school year so they can see 
what we're like when we're not putting on a 
show.

Republicans Threaten Education 
The GOP's reliance on the free market to provide quality 
schools will only doom the public school system to failure 
Arizona Daily Wildcat (U. Arizona) 

(U-WlRE) TUCSON, Ariz. - Arizona's 
Superintendent of Public Instnlction Lisa 
Graham Keegan might be getting a new job. 

It depends on whether GOP presidential 
contender George W. Bush a) wins the pres-
idency this November and b) agrees to 
appoint the McCain suppotter his Secretary 
of Education. 

If all of the above come true, America 
can kiss the public education system good-
bye. 

It is no secret that Keegan has champi-
oned a highly conservative approach to 
education. She wants to tum public educa-
tion into a market-based system, which 
makes her the darling of those who want to 
end the public education system. 

Pundit George F. Will wrote an endorse-
ment for her in his April 17 Newsweek col-
umn that likened to a love poem. 

"Keegan ... supported John McCain, 
who, regarding straight talk, is a shrinking 
violet compared with Keegan, a Stanford-
educated intellectual who radiates prickly 
thoughts,· Will wrote. 

Instead of improving the current educa-
tion system, Keegan's influence would 
eventually tear apatt a public education sys-
tem that ought to be saved. 

The conservative premise that a market-
based education system is best is wrong. 
Even though vouchers allow for "public 
choice." which on the surface sounds like a 
fine idea, it does nothing for the children 
who need the most help. 

Apparently, Keegan believes that once 
you give parents a choice about whete they 
can send their kids to school, all education-
al problems are solved. 

However, the poorest snldents will not 
be able to find their way out of a gheno sim-
ply because the government sends them a 
check and says. "Go pick a schooH" 

There are structural problems that pub-
lic choice programs do not solve. Instead of 
trying to fight the root of the problem -
impoverished neighborhoods and cycles of 
poverty - vouchers will only allow the most 
privileged students to truly have control 
over where they go to school. A single-par-
ent welfare family with many children will 
probably not be able to get out of their 
neighborhood in order to find a better 
school. 

Poor schools exist in poor neighbor-
hoods, and poor neighborhoods are the key 
problem that Keegan's agenda does nothing 
to solve. Simply taking a few lucky kids out 
of a bad neighborhood does not get to the 
root of the nation 's education problem. 

Students should not have to move any-
where in order to receive a good public edu-
cation. The goal is to make all public 
schools good, to improve the system as it is. 

However, Keegan wants a revolution . 
"(Keeganl does tend to lean toward com-

pletely changing things, blowing them up 
and statting over instead of building on suc-
cess," Penny Kotterman, president of the 
Arizona Education Association, told The 
Associated Press. "She is clearly a spokesper-
son for the Republican agenda for educa-
tion: 

Will's love poem to Keegan proves that 
she represents the conservatives' education-
al agenda. He writes, "Bush would be wise 
to start now using his campaign to raise her 
profile as his kind of conservative and to 
begin plagiarizing from her: 

Even though Keegan supported McCain 
in the Republican primary, her conservative 
agenda should win her plenty of support 
within the party for the appointment to 
Secretary of Education. She is a prime con-
servative candidate for the post. 

If we elect another President Bush, 
America should pucker up. 

It will soon be kissing public education 
goodbye.

Examples of more daring 
experiments abound in other 
parts of the country. Atlanta is 
studying small living communities 
with apartments, shops and enter-
tainment. well served by a city-
wide subway system. Most Italian 
cities are shutting down private 
traffic on Sundays to see in prac-
tice how to create the conditions 
for a city life less dependen t on 
cars. Italians seem to be enjoying 
it tremendously. Parisians are 
hypothesizing how the advent of 
electric cars, with their long refu-
eling time, will change the con-
cept of ownership of a means of 
transportation . The ,current 
model is that owning private 
transportation is tantamount to 
owning the physical object that 
makes transportation possible. 
This will be impractical with the 
private ownership of electric cars. 
and the city of Paris is toying with 
the idea of purchasing the use of a 
car as opposed to the physical 
ownership of the car itself (so 
that, instead of refueling, one can 
just use a different car) . 

The cities on the West Coast of 
the United States are heavily 
dependent on cars and have been 
active in promoting technological 
solutions to some of the problems 
they create - from clean gasoline 
to electric cars. Yet these cities 
don't seem ready to pioneer, or 
even admit, the social, architectural 
and cultural. changes that other 
transportation alternatives will 
entail. Why aren't our cities even 
promoting a debate on these 
issues? 

The United States has been 
known for daring social experi-
mentation - the institution of a 
suburban society completely 
dependent on the car being just 
one example - but now we don't 
seem able to take action in 
response to the changed circum-
stances that should push us to 
question our development model. 
This might just be a consequence 
of a more general involution of the 
American society in the last 20 
years, or just a tribute to the 
strength with which the idea of the 
private car was planted in our col-
lective consciousness, 

As you sit contemplating this in 
rush hour, as the traffic starts mov-
ing around you, at least you can 
find solace in this: It's Friday. You 
wo~'t l;Jave to go through this again 
until ~onday.

World News China: 
Israeli Supreme Court Frees 13 Lebanese Prisoners Ad would mandate cooperation with Taiwan 

ContI ..... frOIII ..... 1 JERUSALEM - After spend-
ing years in prison in Israel with-
out charges, 13 Lebanese 
detainees were driven Wednesday 
morning in a caged van to the bor-
der. There they waited into the late 
afternoon, blindfolded and hand-
cuffed, while a last legal wrinkle 
was ironed out in their cas". 

Finally, after the Isradi 
Supreme Court rejected an 11 th-
hour petition to keep the men 
behind bars, Israeli soldiers hand-
ed them over to the International 
Committee of the Red Cross and 

the men crossed back into 
Lebanon. Boarding a bus at the 
Fauna Gate, one detainee raised 
his hands to the sq, covered his 
face and shook his head in relief 
and disbelief. 

In the Lebanese town of Kfar 
Tibnit, relatives and supporters 
had been waiting for days to greet 
the men, whose release date kept 
getting postponed. By the time the 
detainees' bus arrived, hundreds 
mobbed it, some throwing rice, 
some weeping, and some fainting 
from emotion. 

To their relatives' frustration, 
their bus then rolled on for a two-
hour tour through the Lebanese 
countryside, orchestrated by the 
HezbQliah Shiite Muslim group. 
The relatives followed behind, in a 
convoy that snaked back 100 vehi-
cles. Only at Hezbollah headquar-
ters, after the men kneeled at the 
feet of the leader, Sheik Hassan 
Nasrallah, did the families finally 
get to embrace them. 

Hassan Hijazi, who was "a baby 
without a beard" when his older 
sister last saw him in 1986, looked 

pale and slight and overwhelmed 
by the many relatives who smoth-
ered him with affection. 

Like Hijazi, several of the men 
had been imprisoned for more than 
a decade, since they were teen-
agers. Starting in the mid-1980s, 
they had been abducted from 
Lebanon. convicted as guerrilla 
sympathizers, and, after serving 
brief sentences, held as "bargaining 
chips" for missing Israeli soldiers. 
Some never stood trial at all .

PARIS - A bomb exploded at a 
McDonald's restaurant in a small 
city in Brittany Wednesday, killinS a 
restaurant worker, and the lntenor 
Minisuy suggested that it was the 
work of an obscure Breton sepa-
ratist movement. A second bomb 
found outside a post office in 
Rennes, 3S miles away, was defused. 

The explosion at the Brittany 
city, Dinan, went off at about 10 a.m. 
near the restaurant's drive-through 
window. The force of the explosion 
hurled the body of Laurence Thrbec. 
28, into shrubbery near the parlting 

lot. Few customers were in the 
restaurant at the time. 

No one took responsibility for 
either bomb, but the police said 
three sticks of dynamite found in 
Rennes were from a cache of eight 
tons stolen ' at gunpoint from an 
industrial depot last September. 
The police eventually recovered 
five tons and arrested members of 
the small Brittany Combat Group 
and the better-known Basque sep-
aratist movement ETA.

McCain Admits Fault on S.C. Flag Issue 
COLUMBIA, S.C. - Sen. John 

McCain apologized Wednesday for 
not having called for the removal 
of the Confederate battle flag from 
the South Carolina Statehouse 
when he campaigned in the state's 
Republican presidential primary, 

sayin~ he had compromised his 
prinCiples out of political self-
interest. 

McCain, who built his presi-
dential quest on a reputation for 
candor and patriotism, said he had 
equivocated on the flag issue 
because he feared that if his tnle 
feelings had been known they 

would have undermined his effol1 
to wrest the nomination from Gov. 
George W. Bush of Texas. McCain 
said in the campaign that the divi-
sive issues should be left to the 
state, as had Bush, who stood by 
the position Wednesday. 

Ln a subdued- speech at a lun-
cheon a stone's throw from the 
Capitol where the Confederate bat-
tle flag flies, McCain, a former 
Navy war hero whose ancestors 
fought for the South, indicted him-
self for a lapse in honor. 

"[ feared that if I answered hon-
estly, I could not win the South 

Carolina primary; McCain said. 
"So I chose to compromise my 
principles. I broke my promise to 
always tell the truth." 

In January, McCain said that he 
considered the flag a "symbol of 
racism and slavery: The next day 
he called it a " symbol of heritage: 
a phrase used by supporters of the 
flag. At all times he declared that 
the issue should be left up to the

Tennessee Holds First Execution in 40 Years 
NASHVILLE Early 

Wednesday morning, Tennessee 
executed its first death row inmate 
in 40 years. The inmate, Robert Glen 
Cae. 44, was killed by lethal injec-
tion for the 1979 rape and murder of 
8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin in the 
West Tennessee town of Greenfield. 

MWe are grateful that the judi-
cial system has finally, after 21 long 
years in the state of Tennessee, 
honored, remembered and fulfilled 
its obligation to Cary Ann's right to 
life,w the girl's mother, Charlotte 
Stout, told reporters outside the 
prison just minutes after witness-

ing the execution. "She had a right 
to live, and he took that from her: 

As Stout spoke, Coe's family left 
the prison without talking to rep-
resentatives of the news media. But 
in an eerie moment, one of Cee's 
sisters could be heard wailing in 
the background just as Stout was 
remembering her daughter'S last 
words to her killer. 

"Please do not forget Cary's 
words, 'Jesus loves you,'" Stout said. 
"These are her legacy to her killer, to 
Robert Cae's family and to us. My 
child will finally rest in peace. W 

Tennessee had been the only 

INTERNATIONAL 

state in the former Confederacy 
that had not executed anyone since 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 
1976 that the death penalty did not 
inherently violate the Constitution. 
The South leads the nation by far 
in the number of executions car-
ried out since that ruling. 

A federal appeals court found him 
mentally competent, and the 
Supreme Court denied his last appeal, 
on Thesday. He was pronounced dead 
at 1 :37 a.m. at the Riverbend 
Maximum Security Prison.

schools with higher rates of accep-
tance were the University of 
Pennsylvania and Cornell 
University, with rates of approxi-

Dean of Admissions Karl

Princeton University experi-

applicants, with 8 percent fewer 
students applying this year. 
Princeton's acceptance rate also 
rose slightly, from 11 .4 percent in 
1999 to the current rate of 12.2 
percent. 

The acceptance rate for Yale 
University went down - although 
slightly - despite this year's three 
percent decrease in applicants. 
Sometimes, increases in applications 
can be due to university initiatives. 
such as enhancing financial aid 
opportunities. Other times, the 
increases can have more to do with 
external factors.

Arts and Entertainment 

April2Q better known as 420 to the cannohis culture, ho.s been unofficially 
deSignated as national 'bum daY, but how exactly did 420 originate? 

The day gets a little hazier on April 20. A mellow vibe 
fills the streets of Ocean Beach and Hillcrest, people slow 
strolling with their ~ark s~nglasses hiding a hin.t of para-
noia. The wind carnes a piney smell, accented wtth a dash 
of spice and bluebef!ies. .. . 

Classic rock radIO stattons receIve an unusually hIgh 
number of requests for Steve Miller, Phish, Pink Floyd and 
most of all, The Grateful Dead. In fact, the FM airwaves are 
all filled with a strange repetition of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh . 
and Dr. Dre. As the afternoon wanes, people begin to con-
gregate in enonnous beach circles and small apartment 
clusters. Someone lights up the Nag Champa incense as 
seconds tick slower and the time reluctantly comes. 

No worries. No hurries. It's 420 Day - a self-pro-
claimed holiday not pnly for stoners, but everyone who 
enjoys a toke of cannabis once in a blue moon. At 4:20 
p.m., oxygen levels slightly fall as millions of smokers burn 
their herb and inhale. 

The question as to .:le significance of "420" has circu-
lated through urban legends for years. Many believe 420 to 
be a police code for possession of marijuana, a theory 
which is disproved easily by asking any peace officer. N.or IS 
the legend that marijuana contains 420 active ingredtents 
true. The truth, however, seems more unbelievable than the 
two. plausible legends. . " " . 

High TImes magazine first recogmzed 420 m 1991 as a 
San Rafael police code for "pot smoking in progress." It 
later retracted the statement in 1998 and corrected it by 
introducing a small '70s band cal~d The Waldos. 

San Rafael 's Steve Waldo claim d that he and his friends 
were the originators of the now mfamous number. He 
offered to take a polygraph test when telling his st~ry, 
which began with a wall on the campus of San Rafael High 
School.

Get Up Stand Up, Stand Up for Your Rights 
The majority of marijuana consumers mistakingly believes that the 'war on drugs' does not concern them 
By DAVID LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

111is is a warning to l'Vcryone 
who enjoys a taste of cannabis. 
Whether you are a habitual or occa-
sional smoker, you are at war. 

The actual campaign started in 
the early • Os with the Reagan 
administration's staunch "zero tol-
erance" attitude toward any form of 
illegal narcotic, including marijua-
na. However. the fight did not end 
with the Republicans - Clinton 
took up the mantle and assigned 
Gen. Barry McCaffrey to the posi-
tion of drug czar in 1996. . 

This man is not simply a "desk" 
general. but instead, a West Point 
graduate who did tours in both 
Vietnam and Iraq. In his accep-
tance speech. McCaffrey 
announced an anti-drug publicity 
blitz that would specifically target 
marijuana "consumption." 

Many a smoker might conjure up 
visions of coca fields being raided by 
special forces when thinking about 
the "war on drugs." However. many 
do not know that there is a marijua-
na-related arrest every two minutes 
in the United States, and over 80 
percent of these arrests are due to 
personal consumption. according to 
the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. 
Of the 20 percent accused of "sale 
and manufacturing," the actual 
crime involves personal cultivation 
of over one ounce. which leads the 
police to infer possession with 
"intent to distribute." 

The arrest statistics clearly dis-
prove a common misconception 
that the government does not 
aggressively pursue recreational 

smokers. In fact, personal con-
sumers were the bread and butter of 
the Bush administration's 1989 
National Drug Strategy Control, 
which labeled recreational smokers 
as "advertisements" for drug use and 
labeled their practices "highly conta-
gious." 

Neither has the Clinton adminis-
tration eased the intensity of the war. 
spending an estimated $7 billion 
each year to track. hunt and lock up 
any marijuana consumers. 

One reason there are so many 
marijuana-related arrests is that 
users either do not understand or do 
not exercise their legal rights. With 
growing organizations such as the 
National Organization for the 
Reform of Marijuana Laws, marijua-
na consumers no longer need to be 
victims in this war. The following 
information will help consumers' 
cause. 

Not only every smoker. but every 
American should be aware of the 
Fourth and Fifth Amendments to 
the Constitution. The Fourth states: 

"The right of the people to be 
secure in their persons, houses. 
papers. effects. a$amst unreasonable 
searches and seIZures. shall not be 
violated. and no warrants shall issue. 
but upon probable cause. supported 
by the Oath of affirmation. and par-
ticularly describing the place to be 
searched and the persons or things 
to be seized." 

The Fifth Amendment states: 
"No person shall be ... compelled 

in any criminal case to be a witness 
against himself. nor be deprived of 
life. liberty or property without due 
process of the law." . 

In other words. the cops cannot 

search YOLl unless they have a 
damn good reason. You should 
wield these laws like a samurai. not 
like a Viking. Playing Dennis Leary 
with a cop will only raise his or her 
already donut-injected blood sugar 
levels to pissed off proportions. 
However. playing it smooth and 
being collected will give the officer 
less of an excuse to beat out his or 
her inferiority complex on you. 

When an officer approaches 
you and asks if he can search your 
car. you should only accept if you 
are absolutely positive that you and 
your automobile are completely 
clean. If YOLl have the slightest 
inclination of possession. then you 
should never consent to a search. 

The attitude is crucial here. Once 
an individual refuses to consent. the 
officer must either detain the person 
or attempt to get a warrant. but the 
fact that an individual refuses does 
not give the officer a proper motive 
to obtain a warrant. 

Officers are trained to be intim-
idating and deceptive in order to 
obtain a citizen's consent. They 
may either promise leniency or 
threaten to arrest you. Whatever 
they say. keep to the guns of the 
Fourth and Fifth Amendments by 
saying. "I retain my Fourth Amend-
ment rights and aU other rights 
stated under the U.S. Constitution 
and will say nothing until my attor-
ney is present. Thank you." 

This is the difference between 
small consumers getting thrown 
into jail and Mafia leaders walking 
away scot free - knowing your 
rights. Even when a warrant has 
been attained. there is no need for 
panic. Many warrants are later

required to stay at all times. All 
questiolled individuals should ask. 
"Am I being arrested or detained? 
If not. may I go now?" 

The truth is that most con-

directly affected by it The trick is to 
be knowledgeable about your rights 
and to believe that those rights were

although some may try to dampen 
such beliefs. The rules for survival in 
the war on drugs is simple: Survive 
and don't get caught in the crossfire.

Interview With a Dealer 
A conversation with a marijuana dealer corrects 
common misconceptions 
Specilll to the Guarrj., 

Aside from the paraphernalia. marijuana 
has seeped into pop culture as exhibited 
through the "420" T-shirts that can be seen 
during network prime-time hours. Hard sta-

~tics say that 25 percent of all teenagers have 
tned the drug. Overall, 70 million Americans 
have tried it once while 12 million use mari-
juana on a regular basis according to the 
Office of National Drug Control. 

The biggest change in pot society over the 
years. however. is its most misunderstood 
creature: the dealer. 

The media has always painted a sinister 
portrait of drug dealers. making them seem as 
corrupt and malicious as murderers and 
politicians. Hip hop culture has refined that 
image into a sympathetic product of an 
oppressive government. 

However. 12 million regular users don't 
center in Hell's Kitchen or South Central. 
They reside in suburbs with names like 
Tarzana and Oak Creek. For coUege students. 
they live right down the dorm hall or two 
floors above their campus apartment. The 
identity of the dealer has not changed. it has 
merely expanded. 

Break the 
dress code 

The following is an interview with a stu-
dent dealer. His reflections on dealing mari-
juana reveal both personal insight and some 
plain. straight answers toward common mis-
conceptions. 

How long ~ you been dealing pot 
and what made you start? 

Two years. I started smoking regularly my 
senior year of high school. When I got to col-
lege. I figured that dealing would be a great 
way for me to smoke for free. Of course. all this 
shit wouldn't be possible if I hadn't known the 
right people. 

How did you get inwMd in dealing 
marijuana? 

Like I said. it's the people you know. I was 
originally comfortable talking to dealers since 
my own dealer from high school was a good 
friend of mine. But I didn 't stan from him. 
Why? Well. it would be too fucking weird to 
do business with him. But I found some deal-
ers in San Diego and asked them if they could 
hook me up. I started dealing ounces. then 
moved up to "QPs. " 

Ounces? uQPs"?

12 HIATUS 

Contribulirw Hiatus Writer 

For many a pot smoker, Amster-
dam is considered the land of milk 
and honey. Every year, thousands of 
American stoners strap on their 
clogs and get ready to see Holland's 
tulip laden windmills, but most · 
importantly, to see all those hash 
bars Cheech and CMng made pop-
ular back in the States. 

For the marijuana enthusiast, 
ovember is the month to go to 

Amsterdam and for one simple rea-
son- The Cannabis Cup, a week 
long festival celebrating the world's 
favorite herb. . 

The Cannabis Cup was founded 
by High TtmeS Editor in Chief Steven 
Hager on a trip to the Netherlands 
in 1987. The purpose of the trip was 
to interview the founder of The Seed 
Bank, supposedly Holland's first 
cannabis seed company. During his 
stay, it was visiting Americans. sur-
prisingly, that inspired the idea for 
the Cannabis Cup with constant 
stories about harvest festivals held in 
California in the early '70s. 

Hager wanted to establish a sim-
ilar festival in Amsterdam with the 
intention of creating an internation-
al standard for cannabis seeds. [t 
became a reality the following year 
with the first annual Cannabis Cup. 

The first Cup involved three 
judges and only involved seed com-
panies. Year by year, the Cup grew to 
become a commercial success on an 
international level. By the seventh 
Cup, 700 judges with over 100 
strains of marijuana were involved in 
what would become one of the 
world's largest cannabis festivals. 

This year's 13th annual 

Cannabis Cup is expected to be the 
largest in its history. The festivities 
will take 'place from November 19-
23 with over 1500 participants. The 
Cup's theme has been dubbed 
"The Goddess Cup" in celebration 
of the female cannabis plant, other-
wise known as chronic, gold ganja, 
chiba, etc .... 

Although the Cup's main goal is 
still to judge and rate the world's 
best cannabis, it has evolved into an 
overall celebration of the herb in 
general. Cannabis seed companies 
such as the Seed Company, Sensi 
Seed Bank and Dutch Passion 
open up their factory doors to the 
public JUSt like Willy Wonka did for 
Charlie and Veruca Salt. And like 
breweries here in America, all visi-
tors leave with a tiny sarr ')Ie of the 
company's finest.

Hash bars get into the mix of 
things by offering free samples and 
discounted prices on all their mer-
chandise. During the cup, the bars 
are filled with smokers from 
around the world where Woody 
Harrelson might be lighting up a 
joint. John Trudell, former chair of 
the American Indian Movement! 
showed up for the 9th annual Cup 
and there's bound to be one Marley 
present each year.

The most common question 
that arises concerning the 
Cannabis Cup is how exactly one 
"judges" cannabis. Since judging 
only involves a monetary fee and 
no real experience is necessary, all 
judges are given this general out-
line on how to grade cannabis.

Is there a thick coat of white or

Thursday, April 20, 2000 

Interview: 
April 20 is like an after-
Thanksgiving sale 
CoMI .... ".... ..... u 
cheaper the weed gets. When some-
one gets started out in dealing. they 
usually deal ounces [28 grams), but 
the profit from that will only give 
them about an eighth (3.5 grams) of 
head stash or $40-$60 profit if they 
don't smoke any. An ounce can 
range from $330 to $400, depending 
on the relationship you have with 
your supply. Beyond that level are 
quarter-pounders or QPs [4 ounces) 
which can cost anywhere fro~ 
$1,100 to $1 ,300 - again depending 
on your relationship to your dealer. 
Beyond that are pounds or "elbows· 
and so on and so on. 

Basically, if you buy a shitload of 
weed, a gram can COSt as little as $5. 
Just like Costco. nne black market 
price is $20 per gram in Southern 
California./ 

What type of c1imtde do you 
have? 

Mostly studt:nts. but I do talk to 
some guys that just work and smoke. 
Doctors and lawyers get their bud 
usually from older sources since they 
feel weird about hooking up from 
someone so young. but I know for a 
fact that some of my clients hook up 
for their employers, some of them 
being doctors. It's random - every-
one from my acupuncturist to a TA 
last year. 

How profitable is dcaling mar-
ijuana? 

Like I said, it depends on how 
much you're dealing. Most ounce 
dealers, which is who students gener-
ally hook off of, make about $60 for 
every ounce they sell. QP dealers can 
range from $60-$200 a QP, depend-
ing on how much weed you smoke. 
It goes up and up the more you buy. 
Also, thanks to the black market, 
speculation is probably the best way 
to earn the most for your buck. The 

East Coast generally pays more for its 
weed than in the West. So if you 
stock up in S.D. and make a road trip 
to New York, you11 come back with a 
Iinle more than a nest egg. 

What are some common mis-
conceptions about dealers? 

A lot of things. Even though I said 
dealing can be profitable, most deal-
ers are heavy smokers too. Most 
ounce dealers don't make any profit 
and just deal for their own private 
head stash. No matter what quantity 
you deal, though, all dealers are 
summed up as being rich. So you're 
expected to pack every bowl and pay 
for shit. 

I know I make money doing this, 
but I also have two other jobs. Why 
do I make money? Because I work a 
lot of fucking hours. Most people 
think that dealing is just sitting on 
your ass and waiting for people to 
come to you. Well, so is any other 
profitable business, but It also 
mvolves comparison shopping. hag-
gling. dealing with the cops and pret-
ty much every other business factor. 

How do you deal with the 
police? Are you nenoous, scared? 

I don't Yes and yes, but apparent-
ly not scared enough. 

And finally, how is 4120 differ-
ent from any other day? 

4120 can be looked at either as a 
toner's holiday or a dealer's holiday. 

The whole point is to smoke for 
those who do it occasionally, and 
smoke a shitload for those who do it 
regularly. The stoner side of 4120 is 
an easy day of smoking and getting 
fucked up. For the dealer, it's Crazy 
Lany time. The phone and pager 
never stops for one second from the 
19th to the 20th for most dealers. 
Sales come up and everyone wants to 
buy weed. A very hectic and nerve-
crunching feeling, but the money 
that's made makes up for it. Its like 
the after-Thanksgiving sale for pot 
dealers. where the customers come 
in droves. 

By the way, I'm having a sale. Can 
we advertise that?

Point Lorna proves to be no 
match for UCSD 
time both teams' pitchers settled down, and 
the runs were few and far between for the 
rest of the game. . 

Erick Snyder, who replaced Holloway In 
the fourth, kept the Tritons in the game, 
allowing Point Loma only two runs over the 
next five innings. 

With the score 5-5 in the seventh, 
UCSD's Merrrifieid scored a run off of a 
Point Loma error, but Point Loma tied the 
score in the eighth with an unearned run of 
its own. 

The Triton pitching then stepped up to 
stymie Point Loma for the next four 
innings, throwing strikes. The Point .Loma 
pitchers tried to match UCSD but m the 
bottom of the 12th, Addison, who has pro-
duced for the Tritons all year, poked a sin-
gle into right field, scoring the winning 
run. 

The final score ended up with UCSD on 
top 7-6.

For the Tritons, the big story on the track was 
that of jim Freeman, who streaked past run-
ners to clinch first place in the 110-meter 
high hurdles with a blazing time of 14.32. 

Wale Olagunji was also in top form, 
checking in at third place in both the 1 ()()-
and 200-meter dashes. 

In the 4OQ-meter dash, dependable David

fourth place and Steve Smith chalked up

Three days later the Tritons faced 
Chapman, which proved to be another 
tough test for UCSD. 

The game started with each pitcher 
putting on a performa~ce .. Through fi~e 
innings the game was stili tied 0-0, b~t m 
the sixth, Triton pitcher Alex Cremldan 
tired, and Chapman scored three runs. 

UCSD was unable to recover from this 
deficit; Chapman pitcher Tim Huff was on 
top of his game and the ~isito~ won 6.-2. 

Cremidan recorded nme strikeouts In 6.2 
innings while walking only one. 

The long season seems to be catchi.ng 
up to the Tritons. With so many ram-
delayed contests, the team has bee~ play-
ing games in bunches of late, leaVing no 
room for recovery. For the third time in 
four games, UCSD made more than three 
errors and the Triton bats - while averag-
ing over 10 runs a game during the break 
- have only scored 10 runs twice in the 
past few weeks. 

However, pitching ace john Beaven will 
be returning to the mound soon and should 
give the Tritons a lift. . 

The Tritons were rained out at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills last Tuesday and this 
Friday will face Cal State Hayward. 

her way to a fourth-place showing a~d Lilian 
Liu's effort was good enough for a thlrd~place 
finish . Anne Moore showed her stuff In the 
triple jump, placing fifth . 

On the track the tenacious Triton 
women represented to the fullest , esp cially 
in the 4-by-1 00 meter relay where they were 
tops in the class, placing first with a time of 
49.86. The always speedy jessica Shugart 
ran her way to third in the 200-meter dash 
and fifth in the 400. Erin Selim almost took 
the top spot in the 800 meter but was bare-
ly edged out, settling for an impressive sec-
ond. In the 400-meter low hurdles Nicole 
Rodiriguez grabbed a Triton-high sixth 
place with a time of 65.63. 

Coming up, the Division II California 
Collegiate Athletic Association meet pits the 
Tritons against Cal State Los Angeles, UC 
Riverside and Sonoma State University in a 
competition that Head Coach Tony Salerno 
thinks the team has a solid chance of winning. 

"We've had a lot of success against UCR 
and Cal State LA Sonoma State always has a 
solid team, but we hold some advantages over 
them. I'm confident in our chances in this 
weekend's meet; he said. 

The Tritons look to continue their win-
ning ways as the season enters its final stretch.

State University. Less than a boat 
length kept UCSD from victory. 

"The competition was good: 
said women's crew Head Coach 
Patti Pinkerton. "O ur men's team is 
among the better teams on the 
West Coast." 

The women entered into more 
finals than the men and with vary-
ing degrees of success. 

In the novice eight. the women 
finished second to UC Davis in a 
time of 8:05.5; Davis clocked a 
7:50.2, well ahead of UCSD. 

In the novice four, UCSD fin-
ished third in a time of 8:21.5. 
Crosstown rival San Diego State 
University finished first, with a 
time of 8:18.8. 

"I was pretty pleased with how 
we did: Pinkerton said. "I think that 
in that field, they were very compet-
itive. For our novices to step up to 
the plate is pretty impressive." 

The lightwelghl eight gave the 
women another third-place finish . 

In this race, UCSD faced north-
ern California's Humboldt Slate 
University, among others. Humboldt 
was looking for some retribution -
the Tritons had their way with 
Humboldt at San Diego's Crew 
Classic held earlier this month. 

"You don't think of them [fort 
rowing, but they actually have a 
really strong lighrweight program: 
Pinkerton said. 

Humboldt did get its revenge-
it. placed first in the lightweight 
eight race with a time of 7:48.4. 

The Tritons placed hard-fought 
third with a time of 8:04.3. 

"We beat [Humboldt] two times 
in the crew classic and we beat them 
pretty handily; Pinkerton said. "I do 
think that we all went into that 
thinking that we would handle them

again. The girls had been racing very 
very well and they had a bad start -
a very bad start. They don't have a lot 
of experience, and it JUSt shocked 
them. By the time they recovered, 
they couldn't catch them." 

A fourth-place finish was in 
store for UCSD in the lightweight 
four race as the team stroked to a 
time of 8:35.2. SDSU grabbed first 
place, finishing with a time of 
8:23.4. 

Participating in a championship 
event before their season is over 
has been odd for the Tritons. 

~There have been a lot of changes 
in rowing the last couple of years, 
with rowing being accepted as a 
NCAA women's sport." Pinkerton 
said. "It's kind of turned the whole 
thing topsy turvey. TIle WIRA cham-
pionships, which were part of the Pac 
Ten Championships. were separated 
out. The ?nly weeken~ we could g~t 
the organIZers to put It on was thIS 
past weekend. We had to have it this 
weekend or not at all. Next year it will 
be two weeks before the Pac Ten. It 
will be a good finish to the year." 

The women's team has a lot of 
youth in its boat. 

·We have more novices; 
Pinkerton said. uThis is the largest 
team UCSD has ever had. We have 
44 athletes and 40 of them are 
novices." 

Despite the team's lack of expe-
rience, Pinkerton is happy with the 
t am's results. 

"They were excited about that; 
Pinkerton said of the team's num-
ber of entries in the finals. "The 
crews that didn't make it only just 
missed it. For us it was a very suc-
cessful regatta. Across the board, 
our athletes did fabulous." 

Pinkerton is also thinking about 
what's to come. 

"I really am excited," Pinkerton 
said. "We have some great athlete , 
and they're on the upswing."

Fantasy' sports takes 
you away from reality 

The technological blessing 
that is the Internet has brought 
modern society many ben~fits . 
Information on any subject in the 
world is at a Netizen's fingertips. 
Instantaneous messages bounce 
across the globe, bringing people 
together and shrinking the world 
we live in. 

There is another important 
benefit of our Webbed society, 
however. That is the fantastic 
world of fantasy sports. 

Yes, fantasy sports, in a way 
comparable to how essential 
research is to a scientist, has 
opened even more fun opportuni-
ties to the sports fanatic. 

Fantasy sports encompass a 
number of leagues, but the major 
sports institutions of baseball, 
football and basketball are the 
most widely idolized. 

The idea of fantasy sports work 
like so: you and your buds get 
together and make teams with 
quirky names and you form a 
league. Many sites on the Internet 
have fantasy sport leagues, name-
ly Yahoo.com and Sandbox. com. 

Once the teams have been 
named and the league created, 
there is a draft of all the players in 
the sport. You and the other man-
agers, your pals, take turns choos-
ing real players. 

The way these players perform 
in real life dictates how well your 
team does. The stats the players 
accumulate in actual play trans-
late into points for your fantasy 
team. The squad with the best 
players gets the most points. The 
team with the most points once 
the season ends is the league 
champion. 

As you can probably guess, [ 
have a fantasy sports team. 

I'm currently in a baseball 
league and my team is named 
"The Bends" after a Radiohead 
album. Other teams include "The 
Ball Knockers" and "The Ballin' 
Babes." There are 13 teams in our 
league. 

I have found that having a fan-
tasy team can be consuming if 
you are not careful. I spend too 
much time thinking about my 
team, who to trade and when, and 
how I'm doing in the standings 
(so far a miserable 12 out of 13). 

The members of our league 
stay up all night, myself included, 
chatting on the Internet about 
trades and other baseball issues. [ 
spent two hours one night trying 
to trade for Pedro Martinez, 
which [ failed in doing. Another 
night I wasted over an hour get-
ting Trevor Hoffman . 

[t is kind of silly though. We 
really don't do anything. We just 
collect players and hope they do 
well. We don 't toss pitches or 
swing bats, but we say things like 
"My team's gonna kick your ass'" 
Plus, it's all a crapshoot. Injuries 
can easily make a person drop 
from the top to the bottom. 

Why do [ and other people 
waste so much time with fantasy 
leagues? Why do [ put so much 
effort in something that isn't real? 
Well, why do we do most any-
thing? 

It's fun . Fantasy is fun - and 
despite my dismal place, I'm hop-
ing to move up in the ranks any 
day now.

PORTS 
Wins Rain Down on UCSD 
The Triton baseball team has some games canceled due to rain but goes on to split four other contests 
By TAIl MIUlR 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's baseball team 
played four games last week when 
Chapman University and Point 
Loma Nazarene University traveled 
to the Tritons' home field and 
UCSD made its way to crosstown 
rival, the University of San Diego. 

With the schizophrenic w.:ath-
er of late, the fate of all four games 
were in doubt until the first pitch-
es. When the baseball gods shined 
and the sun finally prevatied, the 
Tritons splil, bealing Point Loma 
in both games of a double-header 
10-6 and 7-6 in a 12-inning 
thriller. UCSD then lost to 
Chapman 6-2 and USD 11-4. 

The Tritons came into the 
USD game looking to awaken its · 
recently quiet bats. The Tritons 
had a tough test ahead of them, 
however, as the Toreros are a 
Division [ team. 

Nonetheless, the Tritons played 
well as they held USD to two runs 
through the first five innings. [n 
the top of the sixth, the Tritons 
went up 3-2 when they took 
advantage of bad fielding by 
USD's first baseman. Timely' hit-
ting by Chad Addison and desig-
nated hitter Desi Loessburg also 
contributed to the lead change. 

The runs were not enough -
in the bottom half of the sixth 
inning the Toreros pounced on 
Triton starting pitcher Edward 
Ishak for three runs. Then the 
usually reliable Brian Hinson last-
ed only one-third of an inning, 
allowing three more runs, making 
the score 8-3. 

UN HIJI/au.diM 
.... UCSD's Chad Addison taItes a swing in a 6-2 loss against Chapman this past past Saturday. Addison is batting .380 with 29 
RBI's this season. 

That was all she wrote - the 
Tritons could manage only one 
more run while USD scored three. 
The final score was recorded as 
11-4 USD. The winning pitcher 
was Tim Isaacson and the losing 
pitcher was Ishak. 

The next day, the Tritons faced 

Point Loma in a double-header. 
"If we go out and play our 

game we should be able to win," 
said Head Coach Dan O'Brien. 

The teams' records seemed to 
contribute to this assumption as 
Point Loma was 20-18-1, while 
UCSD was 15-7. 

The first game of the double-
header was a continuation of a 
contest suspended earlier in the 
year because of rain. The Tritons 

Triton Track Tremendous at 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational 
UCSD has a great day in nonscoring event 

Staff Writer 

At the Pomona-Pitzer 
[nvitational this weekend many 
Tritons represented UCSD well. 
This meet was open only to invited 
athletes, bringing together only the 
cream of the track and field crop 
for some fierce head-ta-head com-
petition. The Triton competitors 
were fired up to have the chance to 
show the rest of the college track 
world that they mean business. 

In the field events, several 
Tritons made their presence felt. 

[n the men's javelin toss, 

UCSD's Matt Meskimen had a 
solid showing, placing eighth in a 
very crowded and competitive 
field. Triton Matt Deford took 
home the bronze in the hammer 
hurl with a third-place throw of 
152'7". This toss was a personal 
best for Deford, and cemented his 
eighth place in UCSD's AlI-TIme 
record books. 

In steeplechase combat, 
UCSD's David Dunbar mustered a 
9:56.50 to grab the 13th spot. 

Men's running also had 
impressive UCSD. performances.

picked up right were they left off in 
the top of the sixth with Addison 
on second and Chris Tallman at 
the plate, leading 8-5. 

Although they scored no more 
runs that inning, the Tritons got 
the win as their pitching was 
strong, holding Point Loma to one 
run. The Tritons added two more , 
making the score 10-6. 

The second game was a thriller 
- both teams came out swinging 

and put up runs in the first inning. 
Triton litcher Andy Holloway 

was tagge for four runs by Point 
Loma, but with men on and only 
one out, Holloway got Jesus 
Pimentel to ground Into a double 
play, ending the threat. 

The Tritons clawed back and 
scored five runs over the next two 
innings to retake the lead. At this

West Coast. 

UCSD's men's team did well, 
as it has for most of the year, 
grabbing two second-place fin-
ishes at the W1RA event. ! 

The women had a surprising 

day. 
After struggling off and on this 

season, the Triton women had a 
good showing by taking a second-
place, a fourth-place and two third-
place finishes in various races. 

The men finished second in 
the novice eight final in a time of 
6:26. t , and a time of 6:11 .8 gave 
the men second place in the var-
sity eight race. 

The second-place varsity eight 
race finish was a heartbreaker -
the Tritons finished just two sec-
onds behind winner Sacramento
