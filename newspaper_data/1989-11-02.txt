UCSD Engineering Researchers 
Return From Nimitz Collapse Site 
By SETH SLATER 
Editor In Chief 

UCSD researchers have re-
turned from the Bay Area with 
their structural analysis of the 
Nimitz Freeway collapse whit" 
occurred during lutm D ~ 
quake. 

111 

sign in Sacramento, 
researchers from UCSOÂ· 
quake laboratory "basically de-
scribed the failure modes" of the 
Nimitz, according to UCSD engi-
neering Professor Nigel Priestley. 

The researchers based their re-
port on recent visits and on ongo-
ing analyses of the collapsed 
double-decked freeway "bridge." 

Priestley said the Bay Area 
research was conducted by mem-
bers ofUCSO' s Charles Lee Powell 
Structural Systems Laboratory as 
part of its $700,000 research con-
tract with Caltrans for developing 
and testing experimental tech-
niques for retrofitting, or reinforc-
ing, bridge columns. 

According to Priestley, the 
bridge's structural flaw "was not 
so much in the columns as in the 
joints between the beams which 
support the bridge and the col-
umns." 

Priestly added that joint rein-
forcement presents engineers with 
"quite a difficult task" in terms of 
prioritizing which bridges are most 
in need of retrofitting. 

"Caltrans has something like 
200,000 bridges," he said, and as-

sessing their structural ability to 
withstand earthquakes involves 
often-complicated studies of re-
gional seismicity, traffic flow, and 
past performance under quake 
conditions. 

Priestley went on to say that 
CaltralS has been conducting such

the criticism. 

Engineer Frieder Seible, another 
memberofUCSD's earthquake lab 
involved in the inspection of the 
Nimitz, explained that joint prob-

lems in California bridges "are 
probably limited to that type of 
structure ... designed in the mid-
to late-fifties." 

Priestley added that the Nimitz 
was designed in 1954 "before our 
understanding of seismic design 
got to the limit that it is now.". 

Engineers today design bridges 
"C081pleRIJy differently" than In 
previous decades, he said. 

Although joint problems have 
been identified as contributing to 
the colJapse of the Nimitz, Pries-
tley and Seible said that bridge 
columns throughout California are

Affirmative Action 
Discussed at UCSD 
By DAVID BURKHART 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students and faculty discussed 
the effectiveness and morality of 
affirmative action policies at a fo-
rum held here last night, and de-
bated whether such policies should 
be continued. 

A panel of faculty and staff 
spoke briefly on the issue, then dis-
cussed it with the audience. 

Dennard Clendenin, coordina-
tor of affirmative action at UCSD, 
argued that the program, while 
flawed, was an important means of 
opening doors for qualified mem-
bers of underrepresented groups. 

"Opponents of affirmative ac-
tion never use the word 'quali-
fied,'" he said. 

Professor of physics Oscar 
Lumpkin, another member of the 
panel, said that affirmative action 's 
primary function is to give us a 
vantage point to see that the under-
representation of some minorities 
is due primarily to poor public 
education in grade schools and high 
schools. 

"If the public school system 
does not do what it is supposed to 
do, it will hurt all of us," but the 
effect will be felt first by minori-
ties, Lumpkin said. 

A first-year Revelle student 
was sexually assaulted last Friday 
morning by a male who entered 
her unlocked dorm room as she 
and her roommate slept, UCSO 
Police said. 

According to UCSD Police 
Detective Sgt. Bob Jones, in the 
early morning hours of Oct. 27 a 
woman "awakened to some male 
intruder in her donn room on cam-
pus." 

A.S. Approves TG Fund Increase 

Though Lumpkin supported 
affirmative action in the 1 960s, he 
now feels it has outlived its useful-
ness and causes a misallocation of 
resources away from solutions 
which would really help the disad-
vantaged, such as improving 
schools in the inner cities. 

"The university pretends this 
problem does not exist," and uses 
affirmative action as an excuse to 
avoid criticism, he said. 

The intruder put his hand under 
the victim's nightshirt, and told 
her not to be afraid, because his 
actions were "just a fraternity 
prank," a police bulletin said. 

According to police reports, the 
victim then screamed and kicked 
the intruder, who fled the scene. 

The suspect in the assault is a 
white male in his 20s, approxi-
mately six feet tall, with a medium 
build, dark hair and a receding 
hairline, according to the police. 

"There's no reason to believe" 
the assault was actually a frater-
nity prank, Jones said. He added 
that it seemed to be a random inci-
dent.

News Editor 

The A.S. Council voted last 
night to allocate an additional 
$4,800 to Programming Commis-
sioner Matthew Schnurer to main-
tain the quality of TGs. 

On two separate votes, the coun-
cil allocated $2,400 for band con-
tracts and another $2,400 for both 
technical services and meals for 
the performers at TGs from the 
General Unallocated Fund. 

When asking for the funds for 
band contracts, Schnurer said that 
a quality band demands around 
$1,000 for a performance. He said 
that $600 was budgeted for con-
tracts for each TG and that there 
are six TGs left to contract. The 
$2,400 would let him contract 
$1,000 for each TG. 

Of the second $2,400 parcel, 
Schnurer said he needed $1,950 

for tech services and $450 for the 
meals, because of an oversight. 
Schnurer said that, because he is 
new at his job, he didn't realize 
that technical crews are used for 
equipment set-up and take-down 
and that more than one crew is 
needed during the event. He said . 
he also underestimated the cost of 
meals for the bands. 

Academic Affairs Commis-
sioner Darin Malloy expressed the 
only opposition to the allocation, 
saying that, with Schnurer's lack 
of experience, there may be further 
oversights in the budget and that 
requesting more funds might be 
the start of a trend by Schnurer. 

"If someone is new at some-
thing, they will overspend," 
Malloy said. 

Other council members were 
verbally upportive of Schnurer 
during the meeting. 

Warren Senior Senator Lisa 
Aaig said that "we've been getting 
good reviews" on the TGs. 

"People under 21 are coming 
[to the TGs] again. It's a real stu-
dent event again," she said. 

"The better the band, the better 
the school spirit," added Fifth 
Sophomore Senator John Edson. 

During the announcements 
portion of the meeting, Graduate 
Student Association Representa-
tive Paul Eykamp asked senators 
to bring up the issue of sexual 
assault in their respective college 
councils in light of two recent 
incident involving the sexual 
harassment of UCSD students. 
Eykamp suggested that the coun-
cils discuss ways of countering 
sexual assault threats. 

"It appears as if it's going to be 
an unusually bad year for thi ," 
said Eykamp. 

Patrick Velazquez, coordinator 
of the OASIS summer bridge pro-
gram, disagreed. 

"Even if it were possible to 
eliminate discrimination overnight, 
the effects would linger," he said. 
Velazquez added that while af-
firmative action is not a panacea, it 
is an effective tool in breaking 
down the barriers he feels white 
society has constructed to bar 
minority progress, such as cultur-
ally biased standardized test . 

Velazquez also added that mi-
norities should not try to "sell" af-
firmative action to white society. 
Instead, they should solidify sup-
port within the minority commu-
nity, then demand programs which 
provide access. Velazquez believes 
that the best solution to institu-

UCB Sociology Prof Comes Under 
Fire For Testing On Jewish Holiday 

UC Berkeley sociology Professor Harry Edwards, 
known for his association with Major League Baseball 
and the San Francisco 4gers, has come under attack from 
Jewish students because he gave a midterm on a lewish 
holiday. 

The test, given to Edwards ' Sociology 3 class on Yom 
Kippur, was worth 25 percent of the course grade. 

"I'm going to temple and fasting, so I'm not going to 
take a midterm," said one UCB student who requested 
that her name not be made public. 

"I'm not going to sacrifice my religion forthatasshole," 
she said. 

Edwards, who represented Major League Baseball as 
an adviser promoting minority hi rings, has been featured 
in majornews magazines and on television talk shows as 
an advocate for civil rights and racial equality. 

Edwards defended his decision by commenting that 
"apparently someone wanted or needed an excuse [not to 
take the exam 1, so they picked this." 

"I don't know what the motivation is,and Idon'tcare, 
because I'm going to run my class as I have done ... for 
over a quarter century of college teaching," he said. 

Many Jews attend temple services, fast and pray for 
atonement on Yom Kippur. 

Edwards explained that ifhe had given the exam later 
than Oct 9, the grading process would have been squeezed 
too tightly with the next midterm. If he had given it 
earlier, people intending to drop the class would have had 
to take it.

Berkeley Students Protest UC's New 
'Fighting Words' Harassment Policy 

A group of UC Berkeley students opposed to UC 
President David P. Gardner's new 'fighting words" pol-
icy have vowed to continue their protest of the anti-
epithet rule. 

,*,SHOE 

"We believe [the policy] restricts freedom unneces-
sarily," said Marco Pulisci, a first-year student and co-
founder of First Amendment-Inalienable Rights. 

But senior history major Christopher West disagreed, 
saying that "calling someone a fag is not an exchange of 
ideas, it ' s an exchange of abuse. We're setting a context 
where people can work together in a basic environment. 

"It'sapersonalissue forme," said West. He explained 
that he was the victim of epithets in an incident as a first-
year student. 

In an intramural football game against a fraternity, a 
member of the opposing team yelled, "You fucking 
nigger, don't you fucking score again," West said. 

The University would not take action against the stu-
dent, he added. 

"I very much want to end discrimination," said 
Berkeley A.S. senator Ben Austin, but added that "we 
can cover most of the wrongdoing ... that is covered by 
the 'fighting words' policy" through legal means. 

Austin said he had experienced anti-Semitism, but he 
believed those people had the right to say what they did.

UCSB Library, Last UC With 5 Cent 
Photocopies, Moves To 10 Cents 

Following in the footsteps of such forsaken American 
traditions as the 10Â¢ phone call and the 25Â¢ candy bar, the 
nickel copy has disappeared from the UCSB library 
system. 

The UCSB copy service has doubled its price for one 
copy from five to 10 cents, but I ibrary personnel say there 
is a chance the price will be reduced in the future. 

The additional revenue will go toward increasing 
photocopy service cperation hours and expanding the 
copy staff, as well as offsetting the recent acquisition of 
17 new copiers, according to Santa Barbara's Assistant 
University Librarian 10hn Vasi. 

"The prices did not go up because the price of a copy 
increased," Vasi said, but because the photocopying 
service is increasing staff and operation hours "to make 
sure there are people around on weekends and evenings" 
and "to offer better service" for UCSB students. 

"When we were at a nickel, we were the lowest in the 
UC system," he continued, adding that the lean hours the 
photocopy service previously kept were indicative of the

Po/ice Officer. Teenager Hit 
Two Injured In Gilman Accidents 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

A l5-year-old bicyclist and a 
community service officer with the 
San Diego Police Department were 
hit by cars in separate accidents on 
Gilman Drive Tuesday evening. 

According to police reports, the 
bicyclist was hit by a car near the 
comer of Gilman Drive and Eve-
ning Way at about 5:28 p.m. Tues-
day. 

San Diego Police Sgt. Art 
Armstrong said the bicyclist was 
"going northbound on Gilman, 
riding on the southbound sidewalk. 
He got to the middle of the block, 
and for some unknown reason he 
just turned and crossed the road-
way." 

The bicyclist was then hit by a 
car going southbound at approxi-

mately 47 miles per hour, Arm-
strong said. There was "very slight 
damage to the car. The bicycle 
was destroyed and totalled," Arm-
strong continued. 

The driver, who was going 
unjier the speed limit of 50 miles 
per hour, was not arrested, Arm-
strong said. 

As a result of the accident, Gil-
man Drive was closed except for 
one lane each way, Armstrong said. 

The bicyclist was in "intensive 
care in serious condition" at Scripps 
Hospital in La 1011a on Wednes-
day, hospital spokesperson Lynn 
Morra said. She added that he had 
suffered a broken left leg, tom 
ligaments in his right leg, and a 
fractured skull . 

As of press time, the Police 
were unable to release the 
bicyclist's name. 

At about 8 p.m. Tuesday, San 
Diego Police Community Service 
Officer Dennis Nelson was hit by a 
car as he directed traffic around the 
previous accident, Police spokes-
person Bill Robinson said. 

"A motorist approached the area 
where he was directing traffic, and 
did not stop. The vehicle struck 
him, and he was thrown onto the 
hood of the car, and he rolled into 
the windshield," Robinson said. 

Nelson was transported by para-
medics to Scripps Hospital, Robin-
son said, and suffered "bumps and 
bruises, and no broken bones or 
internal injuries." 

"He's going to be off work a 
couple of days with a sore wrist. 
Fortunately, no one was seriously 
hurt," Robinson said. 

The motorist that hit Nelson 
was not arrested, Armstrong said. 

FORUM: Affirmative Action Debated 
Continued from page 1 
tional racism may be segregation, 
with minority members using their 
own tax money to build their own 
institutions, but added that such a 
solution would probably be politi-
cally impossible. 

Political science Professor 
Sanford Lakoff disagreed with af-
firmative action on moral grounds. 
He briefly discussed the history of 
affirmative action, and how it began 
as an mildexecutiveorderby Presi-
dent Ken.,!ledy, grew into a pro-

gram of racial quotas, and was 
scaled back by the Bakke v. Un i-
versityo/Californiadecision which 
banned quotas. 

He argued that early civil rights 
progress was consistent with the 
ideal of a "color blind" Society, but 
affirmative action made race a 
central criterion in public univer-
sity admissions and hiring. 

''The whole affirmative action 
program with regards to universi-
ties is a cop-out," Lakoff said. 

He argued that UC admissions 

should be based only on merit and 
agreed with Lumpkin that the real 
work needed to be earlier: improv-
ing schools in inner cities, and re-
moving the cultural bias towards 
failure which he feels exists in 
minority communities. 

"[The job of the UC] is to edu-
cate people who can benefit from 
what we have to offer," Lakoff 
said.

followed the forum, allowed

Bureacratic Mess 

Differing Regulations 
The discovery by fonner Student Advocate Bard-Alan Fin-

Ian of an inconsistency between the Revelle College regulations 
and the University ' s brings up an important issue: the complex 
bureaucratic web of inconsistent and confusing regulations 
through which students must navigate. 

The problem was that Revelle ' s academic regulations defme 
a major as 18 upper-division classes, while the various engi-
neering departments require more. Taken alone, it is a small 
problem, but this isn ' t the only example of inconsistent regula-
tions. 

The idea of the college system is a good one. Students are 
given the benefits of a mall college environment with the 
advantages of a larger university. Student are also given 
choices in the style of education they receive. 

At most other universities, colleges are like departments here 
- for example, a college of business, or a college of engineer-
ing. But here, students are attached to UCSD, a college, and a 
department. Students who have minors or programs of concen-
tration must also deal with one or more other departments. 

Transfer students have it particularly hard , since to have a 
class taken at another school fill a degree requirement often 
requires fi ling paperwork wi th both their college and the depart-
ment the class is in. Students a lso must face differing advice 
from departments and colleges. 

When Provost Bond was asked about the Revelle inconsis-
tency, he argued that " it's like having a state law that is incon-
sistent with a federal law. Clearly the federal law takes prece-
dence." 

But the case isn ' t nearly that clear-cut. In some cases, a 
college 's rules take precedence over a department's. For ex-
ample, in Muir' s interdepartment special projects major, or in 
Warren 's programs of concentration. Candidates for office in 
Associated Students must also deal with conflicting posting 
regulations among colleges, and organizing an event falls under 
different rules depending on where it's held. 

The college system should certainly be preserved, and de-
partments should maintain some autonomy. But administrators 
at colleges and departments should work together to form a set 
of consistent rules. The current bureaucratic mess is unneces-
$ary and intolerable. 

Apathy? 

Helping The Bay Area 
Today' s college students are frequently criticized by the 

" thirtysomething" crowd for being too apathetic, for not caring 
about their fellow human beings. It is true that the students of 
today don ' t stage protests against the U.S. war in Vietnam, but 
part of the reason for this is that the U.S . isn't fighting in 
Vietnam. The students ' response to the earthquake in Northern 
Californ ia proves the charges of apathy are unfair. 

The Assoc iate Students quickly organized a week-long fund 
raising campaign for the earthquake victims and set up tables in 
the Price Center and Revelle Plaza to collect money. They also 
held a Halloween dance last Sunday to raise more funds. 

Despite midtenns, students all around UCSD have donated 
time and money to help area~ devastated by the quake, and the 
many people le ft homeless. They deserve pral e for their effort, 
and deserve to never be called apathetic again. 

Incorrect and Misleading from the use of so-called "fighting 
words" must confonn 10 the defi-
nition of "harassment" as stared 
in the policy. 

Editor: 
The statement regarding the 

applicability of the UC Harass-
ment Policy in the October 26 
Guardian article entitled "UCSD 
Campus Papers Subject to 'Fight-
ing Words' Regulations," is in-
correct and misleading. 

instead, the focus of the policy is 
on conductthat promotes violence 
or a hostile and intimidating envi-
ronment. In closing, the focus of the UC 

Harassment Policy is not on the 
mere publication of words or 
expression of ideas. Instead, the 
interest of the University is to 
promote free expression and the 
achievement of one's potential by 
eliminating conduct that creates 
an intimidating environment or 
stifles a person's educational 
goals,orinterferes witha person's 
ability to participate fully in Uni-
versity programs or activities. 

As I explained 10 the Guardian 
reporter, while anyone could cer-
tainly file a complaint of a viola-
tion of the UCSD Harassment 
Policy, the mere publication of 
so-called "fighting words" would 
not, by itself, necessarily consti-
tute a violation of the policy. 

Stated another way, the mere 
publishing or so-called "fighting 
words" would not, in and of itself, 
constitute a violation of UC HÂ¥-
assment Policy. A violation of the 
Policy requires the following e\e-
ments: 

1. Use of "fi ghting words"by 
students to harass a person on 
University property or other prop-
erty covered under UC policies. 

That is, the Harassment Policy 
is not intended to regulate verbal 
or written expression per se, but 

2. The words at issue must

Burning Flags and Fighting Words. â¢ â¢ 
By hawn Butler 

George Bush wants a Constitutional amendment 
banning desecration of the flag because it is a symbol 
beyond reproach by mere citizen~. The UC Regents 
would probably agree. The UC Regents have, in fact, 
made their own little joust at the First Amendment 
rights of individual Americans - albeit mere stu-
dents - with their "fighting words" policy. This is, 
one may suppose, done for our own good. 

As mere citizens and students we can hardly be 
expected to handle the responsibility of deciding 
what to say, who to say it to, and how to express our 
frustration; the ever-competent and rarely impure 
politicians of ourtime are understanda-
bly worried about the haphazard course 
of our childish expression. 

Interesting. 
And yet, while we may not bum the 

flag or, it would seem, even talk about 
burning the flag without suspension or 
prison time, the Regents may perform 
their own fonn of desecration forciays, 
if not months, at a time ... charge us 
for it ... and rub it in our faces as we 
enter campus on each glorious new moming. 

I'm not talking about burning the flag; this some-
what misled fonn of protest could hardly affect 
anyone but the perpetrators if it were not a conven-
ient way to avoid less important issues like the 
national debt and homeless ness ... child abuse. 

And speaking of child abuse, is it any less a crime 
to let a child starve and die amidst plenty than it is to 
beat it to death? 

I would say not. 
What I'm talking about, then, is neglect Neglect 

that might be excusable in less trying times, but 
which is now wholly unacceptable. If every word 
and action or every American is subject to govern-
ment scrutiny, then is not the government of these 

BENSON 

people equally culpable? 
â¢ I would hope so . . . 

So on each day I pass by the American flag as it 
hangs on Gilman Drive, I look away, a little embar-
rassed, a little ashamed. Perhaps it would be more 
appropriate to say Ihat this flag was hanged, not 
hung. 

Whichever, this flag is hardly a proud symbol any 
longer. It is dew-drenched and dust-flecked, dirty 
and uncared-for. It has not been taken down at night, 
as is ils due, and neither has it been cleaned in aoy 
recent geological age. It may well be petrified, for the 
banner does not wave in any wind that I' ve yet seen. 

And this is the symbol the feder-
ally-subsidized and ever-patriotic 
Regents offers as an example to San 
Diego? It would be more an honor to 
bum itnow ... toput it out of its misery 
and replace it with an appropriately 
new one. 

But that's illegal. At least for you 
and me. 

I wonder if these are fighting words? 
I hope so, for there is little room for 

neutrality on such an issue. Nor, it would seem, is 
there any room for reason. I sincerely doubt that 
many members of the UC administration have no-
ticed the flag's sad state ... as I equally doubt that a 
few bored Texan malcontents with a match could 
have cause such a stir if they were not greatly aided 
by a media so desperate for ratings and III admini-
stration so desperate to latch onto a "problem" that it 
could actually solve; a 1000 points of light? Nah. 
How 'bout 50? 

Forget the oil spill. Forget the homeless. 
Forget the debt. Forget. abortion. 
Forget the Constitution. Just forget it all. 
But as long as you're going to amend it, don 't 

forget your rights. 

Thursday, November 2,1989 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

What is your most poignant Halloween memory? 

It's unprintable. Everybody thinks that I was 
probably an angel, but I really 
wasn't. I grew up in a small 
town in Iowa in the late '50s and 
early '60s, and got into a lot of 
trouble in high school. 

Oh Lord, I don 't have any-
thing. I've got four kids and 
years and years of trick or treat-
ing. Nothing really out of the 
ordinary. 

RlchsrrJ Atkinson 
ChBnce#Ior 

I'm rather tall (6 '4 ") - I 
reached full height around the 
time I was 10 years old. I al-
ways felt bad when I went trick 
or treating and towered over 
the otherkids, and people would 
say, "You're too old.' And so 
finally I just gave it up. That's 
one of the hazards of being tall, 
I guess. 

It was about two years ago, 
when my daughter and I went 
trick or treating together. I built 
Hershey's kisses around us out 
of chicken wire and foil. I guess 
I was so into it that I made them 
larger than normal, and they 
wouldn't fit into any doorway. 
Consequently, we couldn't get 
into any houses when people 
invited us in. 

It was traditional to mount 
an outhouse on top of the high 
school at Halloween, but by the 
time I reached 16, they were 
pretty scarce. 

We found one finally, and a 
new kid from New York wanted 
to push it over but he wasn't 
cognizant of what was under-
neath. He fell in, and we had to 
get a farmer with ropes to pull 
him out. 

But we got the outhouse any-
way and hoisted it to the top of 
the school.

L aw and Society is an interdisciplinary program that emphasizes the complexity and interrelationship of legal, social and ethical issues in 
their historical contexts. The Law and Society minor/program is avail-
able to all UCSD students with a general interest in law as a social 
institution as well as to students considering law-related careers. The 
purpose of the program is to enhance students' critical analysis of social 
and ethical issues related to law and of the legal implications and 
ramifications of policy and decision-making in their fields. To insure an 
interdisciplinary learning experience, students must include in their 
program at least one course from each of the following "core" academic 
depaJtrnents: History, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology.

UCSF Synapse 

Novel Cancer Treatment 
AgroupofphysiciansatHar-

vard Medical School are report-
ing promising results from a 
study that used a patient's own 
white blood cells to fight off 
cancer. 

White blood cells are among 
the key players of the immune 
response. When cells in the body 
undergo unregulated growth, 
cenain white blood cells can 
detect many of the changes and 
eliminate the inappropriatecells. 
In the Harvard study, reponed 
in Lancet, tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (a class of white 
blood cells) were removed from 
patients suffering from malig-
nant tumors of the skin and 
kidney. Large numbers of these 
cells were reproduced outside 
of the body; then the scientists 
activated them with a molecule 
called Interleukin-2, which 
promotes the growth of the white 
blood cells and enhances their 
ability to kill tumor cells. 

ASSAULT 
Continued from page 1 

"The case is under investiga-
tion, and we're making attempfs to 
identify the suspect in the case. 
[However,) there are very, very 
few leads for us to go on," Jones 
said. 

He added that he does not feel 
the case is connected with the Oct. 

The activated cells were then 
reintroduced into the cancer pa-
tients. Abo t a founh of the pa-
tients show d a subsequent tumor 
reduction. These encouraging re-
sults show thatlhe enhancement of 
the body's wn defenses may be 
another way for doctors to treat 
certain kindsof cancer. 

AZT May Reverse Dementia 
In Children with AIDS 

A new study confirms that mv 
does not necessarily cause irre-
versible brain damage, as many 
experts had previously believed. 
PhilJip A. Pizzo, chief of pediat-
rics at the National Cancer Insti-
tute, has reported in Science that 
the antiviral drug AZT may re-
verse neurological damage in chil-
dren infected with AIDS. 

The AlDS-causing virus mv 
has been implicated in loss of mem-
ory, thought disturbances and, in 
some instances, psychosis. In 
adUlts, dementia is usually a late 
stage complication of the illness; 
but in children it can show up very 
early, with devastating emotional 
consequences. Children can often 
lose the equivalent of28lQ points 
as the illness progre ses. 

15 sexual assault of a UCSD 
freshperson. who was assaulted in 
downtown San Diego after a threat-
ening male phone caller convinced 
her to meet him there. 

Jones said assaults similar to 
Friday's occur about once a year at 
UCSD. 

"This happens periodically here 
at UCSD, where doors are left 
unlocked and the opportunity pres-
ents itself, and a guy does what this 

The UCSD Guardian 

AZT works by blocking 
propagation of the virus in the 
body by knocking out a key 
enzyme involved in virus repro-
duction. Thus, the drug seems to 
keep the virus at bay to an ex-
tent, and taking it cuts down 
some of the symptoms, includ-
ing dementia. 

Doctors are not sure how mv 
injures the brain. Perhaps the 
virus can infect brain cells di-
rectly, or perhaps it stimulates 
production of factors that are 
toxic to brain cells. In any event, 
promising results have been 
obtained in children taking AZT 
on a regular basis. According to 
Pizzo, there are numerous in-
stances of it restoring nonnal 
function to children previously 
unable to formulate words or 
comprehend what their parents 
were saying. 

This reversal of dementia has 
prompted doctors to wonder if 
AZT might be effective in treat-
ing otherfonns of dementia, such 
as Alzheimer's disease, which 
affects more than two million 
elderly Americans. Oinical trials 
of AZT on Alzhei mer's patients 
are being considered. 

guy did ... It's real important to 
keep your suite and bedroom doors 
locked. It serves as a deterrence to 
keep these kinds of things from 
happening," Jones said. 

He added that, if students find 
themselves in a similar situation to 
that of the woman in this case, they 
should do "just what she did-
scream like hell. That was the best 
thing she could have done."

THROUGH 
Quarter System Leaves 
Little Time for Students, 

Especially Sick Ones 
-By Jeffrey Yamguchi 
Contributing Writer 

t UCSD, students live 
active lives. Between 
studying, sleeping and 
more studying, there isn't 
much time for anything 

else, especially getting sick. Unfortu-
nately, the inevitable occurs. Last year 
alone, an estimated 11,000 students .... 
made use of the Student Health 
Services. 

Many of the students who visit the 
health center, according to Z. Kripke, 
M. D. and associate physician of the 
Student Health Center, do so as an act 
of prevention. 

"There is no such thing as being 
hypochondriacal," she said. "[Student 
Health] is supposed to be preventing 
and trouble shooting in advance. This 
is not a casualty clinic or an emergency 
room. This is Student Health." 

Kripke attributes the high number of 
preventative student visits to UCSD's 
quarter system. 

" Quarter system people know that 
working not to get sick is worth it . .. 
Students cannot take any time out to be 
simply at home and away. You miss a 
couple of days of class and it's just a 
devastating loss," Kripke said. 

Student Health Educator Dalynn 
Proffitt said, "One of our main pur-
poses is to help students stay in class." 

Although preventative measures can 
lower the chances of getting sick (or 
becoming more ill), they are not 
always effective. Students suffering 
from all kinds of sicknesses and physi-
cal problems visit Student Health. 
According to Proffitt, viral infections 
are at the top of the list. "Viral infec-
tions include colds, flus and all those 
things you have to admit that you do 
get." 

Viral infections are so prevalent 
because they are "spread from person 
to person by coughing and often by 
hand contact," Kripke said. 

Kripke added that on college 
campuses, it is estimated that people 

will get an average of 4.8 viruses a 
year. 

"This is within the norm for the 
college age group to be passing viruses 
back and forth with that frequency," 
Kripke said 

Other problems that bring students 
to the health center include wans, 
family planning, sprains and fractures, 
acne and vaginitis. According to 
Proffitt, behind viral infections, these 
are the five main reasons students visit 
the health center. 

Kripke said that although headaches 
and stomach problems are not ranked, 
they are a problem for a great number 
of students. 

Kripke believes "most students have 
very good immune systems that will be 

IlIustratlou by Carla Lew 

able to pull them through an [illness]," 
but she said that students shouldn't be 
"shy about coming in." 

According to Kripke, some students 
need motherly advice or a push from 
their roommate before they will visit the 
health center, and once they finally 
come, they recite a "whole litany of 
embarrassment about their using the 
health care center even though they're 
not dying." 

Kripke tells these students "everyone 
who told you to come was right." 

However, Kripke admits most 
students realize that the Student Health 
Center is for them and is glad that they 
have this understanding. 

''They've paid for it, they might as 
well come in and use it," she said. 

Dr. Seuss Issues Prescription to People to 'Say No to Drugs' 
By DEBBIE ROSENTHAL 
Contributing Writer 

One could hardly imagine a situation in which a doctor 
who lacks a medical degree issues a highly unusual pre-
scription to thousands of people, but such a phenomenon 
occurred. The prescription was to not use drugs, and the 
gentleman was the one and only Dr. Seuss. 

Theodore Geisel, the man known as Dr. Seuss, latest 
contribution to the education of America's youth is an anti-
drug campaign that he is working on in conjunction with 
Neil Morgan, editor of the Sail Diego Tribune. The first 
cartoon was printed on Sept. 25, 1989 and, since that time, 

has been sent to Navy ships and stations as well as 20,000 
schools and 2,000 newspapers nationwide and in England. 

Morgan offered that the decision to become involved in 
the nation 's drug fight was Geisel ' s own, as is the extent to 
which his work will continue. He seemed enthusiastic about 
the project, although he added that there are no immediate 
plans for subsequent cartoons. The future of Geisel's in-
volvement in the campaign will depend primarily on his 
health which, at present, is relatively unstable. Morgan ac-
knowledged this, but sounded positive about the continu-
ation of the project. 

"I don't press him," Morgan said. "He's the genius." 
Combining his imagination with a sense of moral re-

sponsibility, Dr. Seuss has long since used his influential 
role as a writer to raise America youth's consciousness with 
regards to prominent and disturbing social issues of the 
times. The Lorax, written in 1971, deals with the need for 
environmental protection, especiall y thedesttuction of forests 
for industrial use. 

Recently, this book has been the root of much contro-
versy in Laytonville, northem California, a small logging 
town (population of 1 ,096) whose public school system has 
had TheLoraxon its required reading list for second graders 
for the past two years. The book, acccording to a San Diego 
Union report, provoked a family dispute between the father

SEUSS Book, published in 1984 on the author's eightieth birthday, de-
picts an enactment of the Soviet-

disagreement over which side the

At the time of its release, the book 
was widely criticized for vastly 
understating the root of the con-
flict between the United States 
and Russia in what is likely to be 
young people's first exposure to 
the issue.

The matter quickly escalated 
when mother Judith Bailey re-

optional on the grounds that "our

the end of September, however, 
theLaytonviUe School District

Women's Volleyball on a Roll 

Tritons Beat La Verne; 
Could Host Regionals 

G reg Bene$/(} uardian 
Diana Klintworth killed the Leopards with a sterling offensive per-
formance. She nailed 19 kills and collected 35 digs last night. 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Senior Staff Writer 

After one final dip on the Triton 
rollercoaster, UCSD reasserted 
itself as the number one team in 
Division ill with an impressive 7-
15, 15-8, 15-8, 15-11 win over 
second ranked University of La 
Verne (22-6) last night. 

Inconsistency has been the 
trademark of Triton women's vol-
leyball in 1989, as evidenced by its 
19-12 record. And, for the first 
game and a half, it seemed as 
though this season-long trend 
would continue. 

The Tritons dropped the first 
gamel5-7 and struggled to an 8-8 
deadlock in the second before es-
tablishing any consistency. 

With Diana Klintworth leading 
the way. UCSD won the next seven 
points to even the match at one 
game apiece. 

The Tritons carried that mo-
mentum into game three when they 

jumped to a 5-0 lead and never 
looked back. Dominating from start 
to finish, they took the lead in the 
match with another 15-8 win 

La Verne regrouped in the fourth 
game, however, jumping to an 11-
7 lead. But the Tritons played vir-
tually mistake-free volleyball and 
took the Leopards completely out 
of their offense. UCSD went on an 
eight point run to take final game 
and the match, 15-11. 

"Diana Klintworth was the dif-
ferenceinthematch ,"UCSD Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik said. "We 
ran our offen e great around her." 

The All-American left-side hit-
terpaced the Tritons with 19 kills 
and 35 digs. She was aided by 
senior setter Linda Ross, who 
played one of her best games of the 
season, collecting 52 assists. 

Klintworth felt that the key to 
the victory was the Tritons' ability 
to take advantage of LaVerne's 
weaknes es. 

"We served them really tough 

and got on their players who 
weren't receiving well. We 
blocked, served, and dug well," 
she explained. 

The victory set up UCSD as the 
team to beat going into the play-
offs. 

"We wanted to prove that we 
were the best team, and we played 
well enough to supportthe fact that 
we can do this game in and game 
out," Dannevik said. 

These two will not meet again 
until the regional finals, or the na-
tional championship, where Dan-
nevik expects to see them again. 

Leopard coach Jim Paschal 
looks forward to the possible re-
match. 

"UCSD is beatable, but they 
won't give it up. We will have to 
go out and beat them," he said. 

Klintworth claims they won't, 
"We proved we're the number one 
team in the nation. We might see 
La Verne one more time and if we 
do, we'll beat them again." 

Playoff Action This Weekend for UCSD Soccer 
Women Face 
Most Important 
Tests This Season 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

So the real question is ... which 
team is better? 

Is it last year's Triton women's 
soccerteam - a team that finished 
second in the nation with a 20-1-2 
record, while compiling 18 shut-
outs and outscoring its opponents 
76-7? Oris this year's team-one 
that currently holds a 15-1-1 rec-
ord with 16 shutouts, while 
outscoring its opponents 73-1? 

Either way you look at it, both 
versions of the UCSD women's 
soccer team have one thing in 
common: excellent defense. In the 
last two years alone, goalie Julie 
Freiss has collected 79 saves, 34 
shutouts, and has allowed only 
seven goals. This year, she has 
only let one by-and thanks to the 
Triton defense, has not had to save 
nearly as many. 

Saturday, the Tritons will face 
host Macalesler College (11-2-2) 
in the first round of the NCAA Di-
vision ill West Regional Champi-
onships in a 2 p.m. game in SI. 
Paul, Minnesota. A victory pits 
the Tritons against the winner of 
the SI. Mary 's (12-3) and St. Tho-
mas (8-3-2) contest in the regional 
champion hip game on Sunday at 
I p.m. 

A loss means elimination. 
Last year, the Tritons also trav-

eled to Minnesota for the region-
als, where they took care of host SI. 
Thomas 3-0 in the first round and 
beat Cortland State (NY) 2-0 in the

Uphill Climb for 
Men's Squad; Will 
Be Underdogs 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

The Tritons knew it wasn't 
going to be easy. They had to know. 

Last year, the men's soccer team 
went undefeated - the first UCSD 
athletic team to ever finish an en-
tire season without a loss - and 
wound up on top of the Di vision ill 
soccer world with a 23-0-2 record. 
The Tritons downed Rochester In-
stitute of Technology (RIT) 3-0 in 
the national title game. 

This year, with Craig Gross, 
Scott Hyver, Thien Nguyen (cur-
rently playing for the San Diego 
Sockers) and Eric Dingwall gone, 
the Tritons knew repeating would 
be a difficult task. 

Then, to make matters worse, 
once the season began, along came 

See M. SOCCER, page 15 

finals. UCSD then played in tbe 
national tournament, where it de-
feated Ithaca College (NY) 2-0 in 
overtime in the semifinals, but fell 
the following day to William Smith 
College 1-0 in sudden death over-
time.It was UCSD's first, and only, 
loss of the season. 

Weekend Intercollegiate Sports Attractions... . 

Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus, however, does not plan 
to do anything different if his team 
reaches the national tournament. 

"We should have won it last 
year," he said. "Maybe this year, 
that little bit of luck will be with 
us." 

The team departed to Minne-
sota on a late flight last night.

Men, Women Placed Second at Nationals Last Year 

Swimmers Ready to Test the Water 
By LINDA SPHARLER 
Contributing Writer 

With UCSD's swim season 
opening this weekend against Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, Triton 
swimmers hope to pool their tal-
ents and end up floating higher 
than second place, where both 
teams finished at last year's Divi-
son ill nationals. 

The team has been practicing 
for two months already and sev-
eral swimmers on both the men's 
and women's squads showed 
promise in Saturday's Intrasquad 
Pentathlon. 

Catherine Capri lies, Shannon 
Smith, and Sabrina Lum all broke 
UCSD individual pentathlon rec-
ords. 

Caprilles, a transfer from 
UCLA who was a finalist at the 
NCAA Division I Nationals last 
year, also placed seventh in the 
200 backstroke at the 1988 U.S. 
Olympic Trials. 

Smith, whose strengths lie in 
the 200 and 400 Individual Med-
ley events, broke the long-stand-
ing men's pentathlon record, pre-
viously held by Bill Kazmi-
erowicz. 

Sabrina Lum, another new-
comer to the women's team, 
be ted the pentathlon record for 
first-year swimmers. 

Another outstanding perform-
ance was tumed in by Tim Trap-

nell, who finished just three sec-
onds shy of the Triton intrasquad 
pentathlon record for first-year 
swimmers. 

UCSD Head Coach Bill Mor-
gan said that this year's teams are 
made up of "the most focused, and 
consistently hard-working set of 
people" he has ever coached. 

SWIMMING PREVIEW 

Among Morgan's goals for the 
season arc winning the men's 
conference, and doubling the 
women's pointtotal in the national 
meet. 

This year's women's squad 
includes several talented additions, 
as well as numerous returning All-
Americans. Leading the veterans 
are freestylers Katy Arnold,leona 
Banasazek, Caren Cutler and Julie 
Rankine, breaststrokers Erin Bakey 
and Alice Kirby, and Individual 
Medley and butterfly swimmer 
Cindy Miller. 

First-year hopefuls include 
breaststroker Melinda Hanley, 
sprint freestylers Jamee Couch and 
Jocelyn Rothbard. and Nicole 
Ressler, who placed fourth in the 
200 butterfly at last summer's]un-
ior National Championships. 

"The women's team is going to 
eam what they de erve," Morgan 
said. 

This year's men's squadretums 
the most senior swimmers ever. 

The experienced figures include 
distance freestylers Dave Sacco. a 
third place finisher at last year's 
Division ill Championships in the 
1650 freestyle (15:38), Chris Car-
illo and Brad Thomas, and sprint 
freestylers Rich Daniels, Steve De-
nyos, and Todd Sells. 

Backstroker Greg Goodrich, 
butterflier Don Robertson, and 
breaststrokers Gary Fortune and 
Luke Salerno round out the return-
ing men's powers. 

Newcomers to the men's team 
. include frecstylers Mark Fabien, 
John Rowers, and Jason Tipton, 
along with breaststrokers Hal Od-
den and Taylor Spangler. 

This year's training approach 
has been likened to that of a Divi-
sion I school, as the staff now in-
cludes four assistant coaches, each 
specializing in a different stroke. 

In addition to giving workouts 
and improving stroke technique, 
each assistant coach works c10sel y 
with 10-12 swimmers on goal-set-
ting, motivation, time manage-
ment, and meet preparation. 

"The swimmers have more 
people working one-on-one with 
them now. This breakdown in 
coaching is key to doing well," 
Morgan explained. 

"They have the tools to win," 
Morgan said of both squads, "and 
they're focusing hard on training 
smart right now, so we'll see," 
Morgan added.

T his course provides students with insight into a 
world of information that they 
clearly had no idea existed. 
Students are amazed at the 
amount and variety of sources 
and the specificity they can find 
by using the techniques 
introduced in the class. 

S tudents who have taken el/50 say: "I'd recommend 
this class to anyone (just about) 
- most people aren't aware of 
the 'wealth of resources' 
available in libraries. 

"Many have asked me about this 
class, and I don't hesitate to tell 
them what a fantastic and useful 
one it is." 

"The class is invaluable to anyone 
serious about developing 
research techniques and skills in 
squeezing the last drop of 
information out of the library. H

Irvine, UCSD End in Tie 
Women's Soccer Finishes Regular Season 15-1-1 

By DOUG SHADDLE 
Contributing Writer 

Cruising towards a top seed 
benh at the NCAA Division III 
West Regionals, the women's 
soccer team ran into a slight road-

block Tuesday afternoon when it 
faced the Anteaters of UC Irvine at 
the North Campus Stadium. 

Despite collecting their 16th 
shutout of the season, the Tritons 
could not pull off a victory when 
they were also unable to score, and 

Rhus UqlrIsIOoardian 
Heather Mauro has been taking shooting practice on the opposi-
tion all season. Her 23 goals set a new Triton single-season 
scoring record, breaking teammate Katy Dulock's record of 21. 

the game ended in a scoreless 
deadlock after two ovenime peri-
ods. UCSD, which beat the Divi-
sion II Anteaters 1-0 on the road in 
September, finishes the regular sea-
son with a 15-1- 1 record. 

The game was not as close as 
the score would make it seem. TIle 
Tritons dominated from the kick-
off, never really letting VCl into 
the game. 

The defense, led by seniors Jen-
nifer Kingsbury and Toni Krumme, 
held the Anteaters to only four 
shots on goal. The shutout was the 
team's 16th in 17 games, and ca-
reer number 47 for senior goalie 
Julie Friess who continues to add 
to her school record. 

Although it did not score for 
only the second time this year, the 
offense, which has outscored op-
ponents 73- 1 this year, was far 
from dormant. Strong outings from 
sophomore forward Katy Dulock 
and senior midfielder Sheila Taka-
hashi forced UCI goalie Alicia 
Miller to make 19 saves, as the 
Tritons fired 20 shots on goal. 

"We wanted to win too much," 
Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said, "but we've gotten 
it out of our systems and we're 
ready to play [in the regional]." 

The Tritons left last night for 
the West Regional in Minnesota.

help the situation, Craig Hyde -
who played for USIU last year

3-0n-3 Basketball Wraps up Regular Season on Sunday 
The regular season for 3 on 3 baskelball 
ends this Sunday. There are some inter-
esting matchups on the final day that will 
help bring the playoff picture into focus. 
For tlls off-season sport every team will 
makethepiayoHs. in either the above .500 
or the below .500 divisions. Here is a look 
at each division and who are the ikely 
contenders. 

AM. 
One team has dominated the field thus far. 
AndIyWagstaffs LETS JUST PLAY squad 
has had il\le trouble beating up everyone 
in this division. Despite losing their most 
talented player to a lootballinjury. Wags', 
Hutch. and Frantic have found a new 
chemistry that has them cruising on all 8 
cyfinders. The rest of the field is led by 
RAIN IN' 3's who was the only team to 

make LETS JUST PLAY break a sweat or 
lace up their sneakers. Also playing for 
second place will be PUBLIC ENEMY. 
TOO QUICK. and THIS IS MY HOUSE. 
On Sunday TOO QUICK will get a chance 
at LETS JUST PLAY in a game that prom-
ises to have plenty of fireworks as both 
these teams are very corrpetitive. DonÂ·t 
look lor any change in lorm though. 
Wagstaff and Co. have won just about 
every basketball event to be played here 
at UCSD over the past two years. and 
there is no reason to think that the streak 
will end. 

AI. 
This division is loaded with talented teams 
who win contend lor top honers. A late 
entrant has developed as the team to 
beat. DINNER has racked up an impres-

NO MAGIC rrust be considered a favorite, 
on experience alone. On Sunday they wiN 
clash with division co-leader YOU'RE

6ne. The contest proves to be a classic 
confrontation of 'speed' agaJnst size. 
MAGIC bener not miss any shots because 
at an average of 5'3' they won1 see many 
rebounds. 
IT'S ABITNIPPY got oH 10 a iate start. but 
has quickly risen to the top of the 6:00 
league. They have scored twice as many 
points as their opponents, and have es-
tablished an IHl record. They should be 
tested this Sunday by LONGANDSHORT 
and EARLY MORNING OSTIFFIES' and 
who are currently in second and third 
place respectively. 
One leamfrom the 5:00 league has waltzed 
through the regular season schedule. 
SKUNKS. MAGGOTS AND A DAIRY 
COW is undefeated and has outscored 
opponents by a total 01 over 100 points. 
This veteran squad at this point in the sea-
son may be the best team in this division. 
Some question their record as their com-
petition has generally been under-
whelming. Against the tougher teams in a 
playoff fonnat they may have get in over 
their heads, but thai remains to be seen. 
The bestoftl18 rest includes SPAZ (11-1), 
MYOLD'PE'LOCKER(I1-1). GAMESOX 
(7-1) and JUST DO IT (6-1). Any of these 
contenders could be there on champi0n-
ship Sunday. but in this division, where 
parody reigns, it is often a Iongshot who 
upsets a complacent front-runner and 
steals the title.

Donny Osmond Is Back! 
Trying to alter the public's view, 
he jumps back into the pop Imusic 
scene with a new image and sound" 
But does he still wear purple 
socks? 

'/4.1at would you think if, for your very first interview, 
your editor said to you the words, "Donny Osmond"? 
Tremendous excitement? Awe of the Osmond legend? 
Overwhelming gratitude for the chance at free concert 
passes? . 

Although these were not the precise feelings flowing 
through me at the time of this announcement, if you look 
at my title, located under my by-line, you will understand 
why I can be made to do these things. 

We all know Donny Osmond as the "purple caped icon 
of the Seventies"; the guy half of the "Donny and Marie 
Show"; the performer of such hits as "Puppy Love" and 
"A Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Rock and Roll." If con-
fronted with his name, we mightfleetingly wonder, "Does 
he still wear purple socks?" 

However, most of us would have a lot of trouble rec-
onciling that image with the picture of a performer with 
two top-ten hits and a nationwide tour that kicked off here 
in San Diego last Wednesday. So this intrepid reporter 
went deep behind enemy lines to talk to the source, 
Osmond himself. 

To start off our twenty-minute telephone bonding time, 
I jumped in and asked Osmond how he felt on tour after 
ten years and what we could expect in a Donny Osmond 
concert. I figured I had pressed a really wrong button, 
because he immediately began rambling on about plans 
involving purple capes, "Puppy Love," Hawaiian Punch 
and a duet with Marie. 

During this revelation of his concert plans I kept on 
thinking "Golly gee. How cool. Is my editor really going 
to make me go to this?" Then, with his incredibly good 
sense of humor, Osmond revealed the whole thing as a 
joke. Ha, ha,

Coffeehouse With 
Artistic Intentions 

The CCC restaurant. like the 
coffeehouse. is very comfortable. 
Currently. it isserving as an exten-
sion to a La Jolla art gallery by 
displaying a variety of paintings 
from the gallery's collection. 

Perhaps most exciting is what 
the future holds for the CCC: there 
are big plans for this little coffee-
house. Once co-owners John 
Thaxton and Luis Wong are 
through tying up the business end 
of the newly-opened establish-
ment. they intend to begin con-
centrating on the creative part. 
They want the CCC to become a 
forum for San Diego's arts and 
artists. The plan is to display the 
works of San Diego's writers in the 
bookshelves and its artists on the 
walls.

Hiatus Intern 

In September, a great thing 
happened to coffee lovers in San 
Diego. The Creative Cafe and 
Coffeehouse (CCC), a restaurant 
and adjoining coffeehouse, opened 
in University City and brought 
with it a little bit of the coffee 
culture to this area. 

The cafe itself is small and com-
fortable. Despite the somewhat 
mundane furniture, traditional jazz 
as well as classical music work to 
create a relaxing and almost bohe-
mian mood. Bookshelves contain-
ing newspapers and magazines 
along with French Impressionist 
paintings decorate the walls and 
throughout the room is the com-
forting aroma of gourmet coffee 
blends such as French Roast, Kona 
and Columbian. 

The quiet atmosphere is very 
conducive to studying as well as to 
sitting and solving the world's 
problems with a few friends. On 
warm days, you can bask in the 
sunlight on the patio while sip-
ping Espresso or cafe au lai t and 
choosing from a variety of pastries. 

cakes and muffins. The coffeehouse 
is suited to long visits and these are 
not discouraged. For those want-
ing to indulge, there is the won-
derful, and almost unheard of, 
bonus of free refills served right at 
your table. 

The CCC also features a res-
taurant which serves a variety of 
salads, sandwiches, pastas and 
entrees. Lunches are under $6 and 
dilUlers do not exceed $8. Entrees 
are served with a delicious bread. 
popular withCCC customers. All 
meals are freshly prepared by Chef 
Francisco Americo Maldonado, 
who formerly worked as a chef in 
La Jolla's renowned George's At 
the Cove restaurant. 

Future plans also include po-
etry readings and musical perform-
ances by those looking for a place 
to be heard. The ultimate goal for 
the CCC is to have it become a 
creative and intellectual center.

'Look Who's Talking': 
More Than Mere Baby Talk 
By James E. Ingman 

Contributing Hiatus Writer 

I am going to let you in on a 
little secretthatl discovered. Now, 
other. more famous film critics (like 
Rex Reed and Gary Franklin) may 
try to convi nee you tharthis film is 
a waste of time and should be 
avoided at all costs. But don't lis-
ten to them. listen to me. a college 
student like yourself who knows 
the type o f movies that we like. 

"Look Who's Talking,"starring 
Kirstie Alley and John Travolta 

and directed by Amy Heckerling 
("Fast Times at Ridgemont High"). 
is the type of movie that is not 
going to change the world, not 
going to change your morals. it's 
not even going to make you think. 

What this film will do is de-
liver two hours of pure entertain-
ment and unending laughter. From 
the opening cred its, which con-
tain the most hilarious beginning 
to a movie I've ever seen (00 
NOT MISS IT!), un til the cur-
tains close, this film is a sheer joy 
to watch. 

â¢ movies 

The plot is simple enough. 
Mollie (Kirstie Alley) is a single 
working mother who wants to fi nd 
a suitable father for her newborn 
son , Mickey. 

The ch ild's natural fa ther , 
Albert (George Segal), wants 
nothing to do with neither Mollie 
nor Mickey, for he is "going 
through a selfish phase." Yet, 
Albert does seem to always be 
trying to pry his way back into 
their lives. 

James (John Travolta) is the 
cabbie that drives Mollie ro the 
hospital as she is going in to labor 
with Mickey. J ames later befriends 
Mickey and then Mollie. From 
there you can basically guess the

put on vinyl a pitchfork-pop 
melange that is not to to be over-
looked. 

The Beat Farmers, who formed 
in 1983 and have released fou r LPs 
and one English EP entitled Glad 
'n' Greasy, are made up of "Coun-
try" Dick Montana on drums, 
vocals and occasional guitar and 
accordion; Jerry Raney on vocals, 
guitar and drums; Joey Harris on 
vocals, guitar and drums; and Rolle 
Love on bass. 

This LP, Poor and Famous, might 
just be the turnaround that these 
farmers need. It is quite possible 
that the cash starts rolling in to 
make up for all the hard work and 
touring they've done since '83, 
which has earned them fans bur 
not funds. 

On these ten tracks, there is a 
blend of hoe-down humor and 
well-polished western pop that is 
atthesametimegrittyandsmooth. 

"Socialite," the opening tunc, is a 
loser's lament about the girl who's 
so bu y and so cool that "she won't 
even look you in the eye," and the 
blend of horns and grungy guitar 
kicks off the record deliciously. 

The rest of the record pretty 
much sticks to this George Thoro-
good-meets-the-BoDeans brand of 
rock. 

But of course, there are also 
those moments when the Farmers 
allow good 01' Country Dick to 
ramble up to the microphone and 
bellow out tunes like "If I Can 
Hold Out," an ode to sexual will-
power disguised as a love song, and 
"King of Sleaze," Country Dick's 
auditory autobiography. 

Basically, it's safe to say that 
the Beat Farmers have cleaned up 
their act. Or at least their studio 
act. But for all their belching, law-
breaking, cussing, and brawling, 
the Beat Farmers have proven wi th 
Poor and Famous that they can lay 
down some mighry enjoyable and 
even sellable tunes.

Lenny Kravitz 
Let Looe Rule 
Virgin 

Lisa Bonet has a husband? In 
many cases, ignorance is bliss. But 
not in the case of Lenny Kravitz. 
The 25-year-old artist has success-
fully created a sixties sryle album, 
Let Love Rule , by meshing the 
sounds of the Bearles, Bob Dylan, 
Prince and John Lennon's solo 
works. 

Many groups have tried and 
failed to create a sixties sryle al-
bum. What distinguishes Kravitz's 
work from the pack is the simplic-
ity of his music and his honest, 
deep lyrics. Kravitz has complete

comrol over the album and is able 
to get the sound that he is looking 
for, which is a rich mix of soul, 
rock and folk. 

It is quite apparent on numer-
ous cuts that the Searles had a 
huge effect on many of the songs. 
TI1e title cut sounds as if Lennon 
sings the lead and McCartney sings 
the backup vocals. 

What marks the difference is 
Kravitz's heavy reliance on jazz 
and funk. Lee Love Rule combines 
these elements with an erratic sax 
solo to create a beautiful ballad. 

The best song of the album is 
"Rosemary," a tune about an aban-
doned child. Kravitz takes the 
Dylan approach of great acoustic 
guitar combined with an upbeat 
tempo at the end of the song. 

Like Dylan, Kravitz's lyrics are 
brilliant: "Eyes of brown, matted 
locks of gold I Her flowered dress is 
tattered and soiled / Tear-stained 
cheeks, her feet cold and bare I 
Who could have left a child so 
rare." 

What Kravitz is missing is the 
spontaneity and freedom which

sound like jams, whereas Kravitz 
goes for the stylized approach. This 
is mostly due to [he fact that Krav-
itz plays most of the instruments 
on [he album. 

Kravitz comes from a media 
background; his mother, Roxie 
Roker, played Mrs. Willis on "The 
Jeffersons," and his father is a for-
mer ABC producer. Kravitz has a 
multicultural heritage, and hecred-
its this for his wide understanding 
of the world and his ability to be 
truthful in his music. 

Lenny Kravitz has the possibil-
ity of giving a new generation a 
fresh view of hope and understand-
ing through Let Love Rule, in an 
age when synthesizers and giddy 
love songs dominate the airwaves. 
Kravitz risks not getting the popu-
larity he deserves because he is not 
MTV material, but he is destined 
to make waves in the music world.

States. It hasn't been an easy road 
for d I~ Soviet "super-group," who 
boast an all-star line-up of the best 
in Soviet rock music. 

All themembers, Alexei Belov 
(guitar), Nikolai Noskov (vocals), 
"Big" Sasha Minkov (bass),jan la-

nen~ov (gui tar) and "Li ttle" Sasha 
Lvov (drums) had played in sev-
eral other Soviet rock bands when 
it was quite difficult to do so be-
cause of government restrictions. 
Minkov explains, "Three or four 
years ago in RUSSia, rock music and 
long hairweren 't possible, but now 
there are many rock bands and 
things are changing. It is very good 
for us, very important for us." 

Gorky Park hopes to bring 
Soviet rock music to their whole 
country, as well as the United 
States. Thanks to a Soviet pro-
moter, named Stas Namin, and 
some timely breaks, it looks like 
Gorky Park's dream may come true. 

When Doc McGhee, the man-
agerofBonJovi, MotleyCrue, and 
The Scorpions, heard Gorky Park's 
demo tape, he invited them to put 
a track on the Make A Difference 
Foundation album. They headlined 
the Moscow Peace Festival with 
Bon Jovi, the first rock concert 
ever to played in Lenin Stadium. 

Unfortunately, the band's story 
is a bit more interesting than their 
album. Although it is not bad for 
fairly hard driving rock and roll, it 
fits neatly in the ranks of the for-
mula American rock band like 
Warrant and Winger. I will say 
that it has a better edge than most 
records in its class; I actually like it 
better than anything I've heard in 
that area for a long time. 

The album includes a song 
entitled "Peace In Our Time," 
which is produced by Jon BonJovi 
and Richie Sambora. This may 
give you an idea of the album's 
flavor. 

It also includes their contribu-
tion to the "Make A Difference 
Foundation" album, it is a cover 
version of The Who's "My Gen-
eration." I feel this is the worst 
song on the release. It is almost an 
embarassment. Call me purist, but 
I am quite a big Who fan and this 
is a travesty. 

The rest of the record contains 

songs that you would expect to be 
here, the kind of stuff you find 
holding six out of the ten spots on 
"Dial MTV." As-I said earlier, it is 
not bad. But, it still fails to be 
anything extremely creative or 
innovative.ltceratinlywon'tspark

If you are a fan of Bon Jovi and 
that sort of music, you will proba-
bly like [his album quite a bit. 
Don't expect to be knocked over, 
but for a music scene like that in 
the Soviet Union, which has not 
had the time or the roots to evolve 
like that in the States, the album is 
better than I expected. Give these 
bands and their country some ti me, 
and we could very well be seeing 
"red" in our top forty charts. 

Thompson Twins 
Big Trash 
Arista 

-Bryan Dias 
Music Editor 

While listening to the Thomp-
son Twins' recent Warner Bros. 
release entitled BigTrash, one can't 
help but wonder if maybe the band 
is running out of original material. 
Other than the hit single "Sugar 
Daddy," tnere are very few songs 
worth mentioning. 

"Sugar Daddy" is undoubtedly 
destined to join the list ofThomp-
son Twins classics, as it holds very 
well with their tradition of crisp, 
bouncy chords and overall exciting 
sounds.Another song worthy of 
mention would seem to be "This 
Girl's On Fire," which is an 
attention-grabbing groove with a 
truly dynamic structure. 

The last song which deserves 
any mention is "Rock This Boat," 
which is a catchy, mellow tune 

which helps give the album its 
respectability. The rest of the cuts 
on the album, to put it bluntly, 
seem to be monotonous fillers . A 
few of them, including the title 
tract and "Queen of the U.S.A.," 
don't even sound like something 
the band would normally produce. 

To be quite honest, it is diffi-
cult to concentrate on listening to 
most of the album. There just isn't 
much there to keep the listener's 
attention. It's one of those albums 
that could be played as background 
music without being distracting. 
For example, studying would be no 
problem with Big Trash playing on 
the stereo. 

Die-hard Thompson Twins fans 
will probably be moderately, 
pleased with Big Trash, while most 
people probably would be fairly 
disappointed. It's albums like this 
that make people start saying 
things like, "1 like their old stuff 
better." However, if a very good 
collection of that "old stuff' is 
sought, an album titled The Best of 
Thompson Twins: Greatest Mixes 
was released late in 1988 and is 
still available. It contains ten clas-
sic, sing-along mixes of the Th-
ompson Twins' best cuts, making 
it a much better bet for most lis-
teners than the disappointing Big 
Trash . 

Kate Bush 

-Scott Casmer 
Hiatus Intern 

The Sensual World 
CBS 

I was seduced. The first song on 
the new Kate Bush album, The 
Sensual World, sent me reeling as I 
entered the siren-haunted land-

scape inhabited by her sultry voice, 
enchanting music and evocative 
lyrics. 

As the title sugges tS, the album 
is about feelings, mostly dark ones. 
Unlike her last work, The Hounds 
of Love, a beautiful but somewhat 
abstract conceptual piece, Bush 
speaks personally and directly to 
us. Almost every song on the al-
bum deals with relationships, 
whether it's between lovers, par-
ents and children, or people and 
technology. 

Many of the songs have a tone 
suggesting that Bush is still feeling 
the pangs of a recent break-up: "It 
lay buried here, it lay deep inside 
me lit's so deep I don't think that 
Ican/Speakaboutit. .. Takeaway 
the love and anger I And a little 
piece of hope holdingus together." 
These potent emotions made her 
music all the more personal and 
powerful. 

There are a few noteworthy 
guest appearances on the album. 
David Gilmour, guitarist for Pink 
Floyd and the musician credited 
for having "discovered" Bush, 
brings his searing, soaring electri-
fied strings to two of the songs. 
Alan Stivell, world-renowned heir 
of the authentic Celtic harp and 
barding tradition, lends his an-
cient instrument on two songs. 

I can't think of any radio sta-
tion that accurately represents the 
sryle of music on this album. It's 
not dance music, hard rock, New 
Age or anything easi Iy classifiable. 
It's dominated by Bush's cooing-
screaming singing, her piano and 
Fairlight accompaniment, and 
Stuart Elliot's drums. It shows 
occasional Celtic influences, but 
is thoroughly modem. 

Bush has a very unusual and 
distinctive style. If you don't like 
her already, this album is not likely 
to make you a convert. If you do 
already hke her, or have leanings 
in the art-rock, Peter Gabriel, 
Laurie Anderson direction, you'll 
probably want to acquire her latest 
undertaking. 

Did I like this album? Mmmm, 
yes.

, - 'The Bear' Creates International Stir 
By Scott Casmer 

Hiatus Intern 

The most recent film released by T ri- tar Picture i truly a bold endeavor for the company. Thi film 
i simply titled "The Bear," which quite appropriately fit it content. The film wa originally produced 
by a French film team under the direction of Jean-Jacques Annaud and relea ed in several other parts of 
the world within the last year, where it did incredibly well, breaking box office record in many regions. 

Although it under tandably had to be adapted to an Engli ' h- peaking audience, the transition was 
very mooth with no annoying sound dubs or ub-titles. Instead, the rare parts which contained dialogue 
have been re-filmed with English- peaking actors. 

Thi i a rare quality for a foreign film, which makes the audience forget that it's not an American film. 
It eems that a major corporation like T ri-Star would have little need to take risks on adapted foreign films 
like "The Bear," but after watching the film, it i easy to believe that they've got a ure winner. 

The film appears at first to bea wIldlife documentary. However, itonly takes a couple minutes to realize 
that this i far from the case. The film is based on the 1916 novel The Grizzly King by James Oliver 
Curwood. 

One of the mo t amazing a pects of this film which strikes the audience early on is the exceptional 
talent with which the bears have been trained. It almost appears as though the bear are human actors. 
They are a couple of Kodiak bears from Utah, trained by the immensely talented Doug Seus. 

The main character which the film revolves around is a young cub who loses his mother in a rockslide. 
At first, the cub is totally disoriented and unsure of how to survive. His adventures eventually lead him 
to run into a huge (1,800 pound ) older bear who is being hunted by a couple of rugged big-game hunters. 
This creates a dual plot, where there is the story of the older bear being hunted and the relationship 
between the two bears. 

In effect, the two bears help keep each other alive against the many opposing forces which they must 
face. Finally, they create a new relationship with the hunters, tying up the universal theme of peaceful 
coexistence just as the film ends. Despite the fact that the dialogue is minimal throughout the movie and 
relatively unimportant to the movie's development, the film manages to remain entertaining and keep 
a very interesting plot. 

On an aesthetic level, "The Bear" is nothing short of breathtaking. Filmed in the Italian Dolomites 
and the Bavarian Alps, the movie has some of the most beautiful scenery ever filmed. The wide variety 
of wildlife used in the film also adds to the natural beauty, both in the visual sense and in the way the 
animals interact with each other. The sheer beauty of the entire film should easily win multiple Oscars 
in the visual and technical fields. Politics is the only fact r that could keep justice from coming to "The 
Bear" on award night. 

Without being able to place "The Bear" in a particular category of films, many people will be 
wondering if this film is something that would interest them. It will interest almost anybody to a certain 
extent; it i an excellent movie for children, although the violence which gave it the PG rating seemed 
to bother some of them a little bit. For the more mature audience, it is not the action thriller or the sex-
laced flick that many have become so accustomed to, but it will please nearly all of those who are open-
mmded enough to accept a different kind of film.

But what makes thi movie 

different i its portrayal of baby 
Mickey. Thr ugh the use of Bruce 
Willis' voiceovers, the audience 
hears what Mickey is thinking and 
aying to tho e around him. From 

Mickey's nine month stay inside 
Mollie (which is far too sh rt than 
nine months to be credible) 
through his birth, the sub equent 
year following his birth, up to his 
first audible word, Mickey's obser-
vations of the strange, new world 
around him prove to be the high-
light of "Look Who's Talking." 

Yet it is not only Mickey'S 
comments that make the film work, 
but also the realistic nature of the 
plot. Unlike other corned ies where 
something completely out of con-
text occurs (like Nazi punks crash-
ing a high school party), "Look 
Who's Talking" remains consis-
tently human and down-to-earth. 
It is because of this credibility that 
we develop a sense that we really 
know these characters and can 
laugh with them, not at them. 
When the film's climactic scene 
does occur, even though it does 
incorporate the world's most over-
used ending, a car chase, we do not 
feel cheated because of the feel-
ings we've developed for these very 
life-like characters. 

In addition to Mickey and the 
credibility of the plot, what made 
the film finally clickfor me was the 

interaction of the characters. 
James, which i one of Travolta's 
best performance , develops a 
loveable bond with Mickey, which 
results in orne very tender and 
warm moments. Mollie develop 
another type of relationship with 
Mickey, that special nd that can 
only exist between a mother and 
her on. Alley's performance works 
magically. There i also the bond 
between Mollie and her mother 
(portrayed by Olympia Dukakis), 
who is well tested in the course of 
child rearing. Finally, a bond de-
velops between James and Mollie 
as they witness Mickey's first 
human experiences. All of these 
relationships serve to ~chieve the 
goal of a real-life atmosphere 
throughout the movie. Needless 
to say, they succeed in their goal. 

So, what is the big secret? Well, 
"Look Who's Talking" probably 
won't make anywhere near the 
millions "Batman" did, and it 
probably won't get the critical 
acclaim of "Dead Poet's Society," 
but see it anyway. The movie has 
just the type of humor and creativ-
ity that we can appreciate. It is also 
a welcome surprise during a season 
in which more "serious" movies 
are usually released.
