By MA TIHEW LAIT, tuJJ Wnlcr 

The Academic enale of UC D and 
several secondary 'hoo1 districts of an 
Diego have approved a new Smgle ubject 
In'tern hip Credential program which will 
allow interns to earn up to ~18 ,OOO whil 
reeei vi ng thei r redentials. 

The program, which was designed by 
Associate Coordinator of the Tea her 
Education Program , Randall ouviney, is 
cheduled to begin thiS fall with the 

Intern raking full teachmg responsibilities 
of a high sc hool classroom after one 
!>ummer of training ourses. The unIfied 
school districts of Oceanside , VI ta and 
R.lmona have agreed to pay the interns 80 
percent of a starting teacher's salary which 
IS usua\!y between ';20.000 and S22,OOO.

Angela Davis, professor of women's studies at 

an Francisco State, delivered an emotional 
address to a predommantly female audience at 
Third College Saturday night. 

Davis, who gained fame in the early 1970's for 
her activitles at UCSD regarding the founding of 
Lumumba-Zapata College (now Third College), 
and later as a member of the Black Panthers and a 
vice-preSidential candidate of the American 
Communist Party, warned that lower cia s women 
may become a "breeding class" of surrogate 
mothers for the affluent. 

Davis ' appearance drew protest from 
approximately fifteen people. several of whom 
were allegedly affiliated with the conservative 
youth groups Young Americans for Freedom and 
the Young Republicans. The protestor at fir t

'The reason the districts arc upportlng

ones who decide which type of interns

and right now math and science teachers 
are in short supply," ouviney said. 

In addition to teaching five or six high

"Our program takes as long as other 
I unpaid] credential programs," Souviney 
said . He believes the quality of this 
program is comparable to other programs. 
"We, in fact, exceed the state's minimum 
requirements." he said. 

Unilateral disannament deemed feasible 
"We require all the students to learn 

techniques for working with students from 
a range of cultures because we feel that 
they should be aware of how to interact 
with students and families of different 
kinds of backgrounds," Souviney said . 

Although this is UCSD's first attempt at a 
secondary school credential program, 
there has been an elementary credential 
program at UCSD which was started in 
1972. The students of the elementary 
program, are not paid for their in-class 
experience. 

ouvlney hope to have 25 qualified 
intern by thebeginningofthe fall , and the 
deadline for applying for an internship IS 
May 15. He plan to increase the size of the 
program in the upcoming years and wants 
any undergraduate student Interested 10

the prerequisite cour es offered at this 
school In education. ~

Dr. Franklin Long, Professor Emeritus of 

Chemistry and of Science and Society at 
Cornell University. spoke last Wednesday 
about the difficulty the u.s.s.R. and the 
United States have in making bilateral 
agreements, and propo.sed unilateral 
initiatives as a viable alternative. 

"Unilateral initiatives," defined as the 
making of policy by one nation without 
formal negotiations with another, were the 
main topic of Dr. Long's lecture , which was 
entitled "Arms Control Begins at Home ." 

On the use of unIlatcral initiatives, Long 
said, "I would ltke to ce it used more and 
taken more eriously. A lot of unilateral 
teps have been takcn by nation; we've 

learned a lot about how to negotiate. This 
admmismltion IS mu h lcs motivated 
toward untiatcml mltlatlve than the 
previou ." 

AmericJ ' reluctJn e to movc towards 
unilatcral Initiative. manifested itself in 

the failure of the Uni ted tates to respond 
to the U.s.s.R's recent moratorium on 
anti-satellite weaponry testing. Long cited 
this example, stating, "It was done in the 
hope that the United States would respond 
similarly . .. . Even though the U.S. 
government took no action, the United 
States Congress responded by cutting the 
funds for testing. If Rus ia and the United 
States make unilateral initiatives, they will 
influence other nations. Politically, they 
are the mo t influential nations." 

In onc of his article, Long had written 
of the influcntial un ti.ne ra I initiative 
former Pre ident ixon made banning all 
methods of bIOlogical warfare . Other 
nation , follOWing the U .. example , also 
b.tnned biological weapons and toX1l1 , 
Long said .

UCSD receives $300,000 
cancer research grant 

The latest genetic bioengilleering 
techniques used to produce human 
monoclonal antibodies to fight cancer 
will be investigated at UCSD during the 
next three years under a universiry·wide 
't1.3 million Biotechnology Researc h and 
Education Program. 

UCSD, one of five cam puses rece lvmg 
fundi ng from t.his grant. has been 
awarded $300,000 for research and 
training programs which will focus on 
monoclonal antibody ca ncer research. 
Research under this grant Will be 
conducted at the UCSD Cancer Cente r 
and the UCSD School of Mcdicme 
departments of medicine and pathology 
and in the campus departments of 
biology and Applied Mechanical 
Engineering Sciences (AMES) through 
1990. 

The state-fund ed universiry·wide 
Biotec hnology Research and Education 
Program , established in 1985, awards 
grants to teams of faculry and scie ntists 
from the UC campuses and nat ional 
laboratories who have organized training 
programs for graduate students and 
postdoctoral sc holars involved in 
biotechnology research. 

Medical, biology and engmeering 
faculry at UCSD have developed a 
training program focused on novel 
methods of producing human 
monoclonal antibodies for use in cancer 
therapy. The goal of this research 
program is to produce human 
antibodies that selectively bind to and 
III hibit or destroy human tumor cells. 

Researchers also hope to produce 
monoclonal antibodies that structurally 
mimic features of tumor cells and 
activate the immune system. 

Monoclonal antibodies are highly 
se lective proteins that recognize and 
attach themse lves to specifi targets. 
such as cancer cell s. Some monoclonal 
antibodies, called imll1unoconjugates, . 
are linked to radioactive isotopes, drugs 
or toxins. They have been described as 
-guided missiles" that ca rry lethal 
substances directly to cancer cells 
without harm lllg normal cells. 

UCSD received its first grant from the 
UC Biotechnology Research and 
Education Program in 1985. Ri hard 
Finel PhD, professor of biology, received 
lunding through 1988 to investigate the 
cellular mcchanisms of cancer cells. 
including using x· ray technology to 
analyze rhe three dimensional structures 
of the molecules. In 1986. Donald 
Helinski, PhD, professor of biology. 
reCCIved funding through 1989 to 
combine molecular biology and botany 
in a ul1lque research and training 
program to uevelop Icchniqucs for

Aid to increase disabled

the g.lllle, ,tg,lInst C I,lI'Cmont-
Mudd, the>' knew that they had to 
play well to win both or the games, 
but th ey outdid even their coach es' 
ho pes. In the first game , the 
Tritons wo n by a convi ncing score 
of 11 ·2. T he winning pitc her for 
UC D was freshman standout 
Mike Morga n . Mo rg,m pitched five 
solid innings, giving up o nly o n e 
earned run, and fi nt s hing his 
rookie yea r with a 4-2 record. 

The s tar of the day, though , had 
to be Bob Natal , who could d o no 
wrong. Bob was three for three 
including a homerun that broke 
his own school record o f 15 
homeruns in a season . Bob's three 
hiLS were also responSible fo r seve n 
of UCSD's cleven runs in the game. 
Lyle Yates h o nors Bob alai "as 
probably o ur best all a round player, 
backed up by ome real quality." 

And onc n eed not look fa r to 
find thi s "real quality" in the UC D 
baseball squad. Derek Alkoni~ was 
6 for 8 one the day, wh ilc 
accumu lating 2 RBI 's . DaV id 
S tanovi c h , UCS f) ' s sentor 
s hortstop, weill 5 for 8 " and Gary 
f'essia, a soph o more in ccnterficld , 
was almost perlect, gem ng hits in 
five of hts six at-bats. Ya tes proudly 
s ums it up: "Everyone hit well , and 
o n the ~ay we go t 32 hits In 14 
inlllngs 

Confident from the first game, 
U SD ca me back ready to 
con tinue their wi nning streak , a nd 
that tS exactly what they dtd , by a 
scorn of 9-5 Pitching ace Rick 
Nowak, o nly a oph omore, chalked 
up hi s ninth Will of the season to 
b reak the foutth school record of 
the day. Rick's season record wasa 
s mas h Ing 9-3, provld ing the 
Tmon~ With good pitching for the 
future as well as th e a dded 
confldenee of having a nine game 
winner on the roster for another 
two years. Every pitcher knows, 
tho ugh . that you have to score runs 
to win the game, a nd that's when 
Bria n Rude answered the c all . Rude 
got three hits from five at-bats, a 
d o uble and two home runs. Brian's 
double was his six tee nth of the 
season, and broke the fifth a nd 
!'inal record of the day. Rude's two 
homeruns let him finish th e year 
With a doze n hOlllers. 

Coach Yates hopes that thiS 
team of expenem:rd ve terans <lnd 
young pitchers can COllllllue to be 
the willning co ml;JlIl,\tIon lor 
U D. The only other IIlgredlent 
to success tha t Coach Yates hopes
