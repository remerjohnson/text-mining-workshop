DRINKING FROM 

Senior Staff Writer 
Last week, the patrons of 

Porter ' Pub took thcir beer ou t 
onto the fence-enclosed patio for 
the first time in recent hi story, due 
to an expansion of the Pub's alco-
hol license. Previously, the con-
sumption of alcohol was restricted 
to the inside of the restaurant. 

"We've had pretty good 
crowds," pub owner Rob Parler 
said . "We also have [an outdoorl 
grill that is open until 2 p.m." 

Though the uni versi ty-
approved ex pansion more than 
doubles the area in which students 
may consume alcohol, the restric-
tions imposed by the California 

Department Alcoholic 
Beverage ontrol (ABC) remain 
the sam\.:. Among these re~tric ­
tions, Porter 's Pub may only serve 
beer by the glass, not in pitchers. 

The ABC regulates alcohol 
consumption at Porter's Pub and 
Round Table Pizza - the two 
locations on campus where stu-
dents can purchase beer - by 
sending undercover officials to 
cheek for minors with falsified dri -
ver's li (;cnses. 

"We've heard Ipub employees] 
arc pretty good about checki ng 
lO 's," Nancy Wahlig, dircctor of 
U SO Student Safety and 
Awareness, said.

Senior Staff Writer 

The first A.S. meeting for the 1998-
1999 academic year last night produced a 
moment of surprise when it was

"threefold: time, money and my future ." 

Butterick stated that hc did not want 
to con tinuc wi th hi !> position if he was 
not able to devote enough timc to the 
office. He stateu in the letter that he is 
currently holding an unspecified job that

"This leave~ mc wllh Icss lime than I 
need in order to do a good joh wi th 
Academic Affairs," Butterick ~ta ted. 
"Continui ng in the position would leave 
me di ssati sfi ed with myself and wou ld

Affairs." 

Additionally. Butterick indicated in 
his leller that he "wi ll need to lind ajob

UCSD Professor Vying for House of Representatives 
KRIPKE: Medical 
school faculty member 
graduated from Harvard 
By Jacob Schechter 
Guardian Reporter 

Dan Kripke: Not exactly a 
household name. Nevertheless, thi s 
UCSD School of Medicine profes-
sor is running for Congress in the 
November eleclions. 

" I' ve been a faculty member of 
the UCSD Medical Center for 27 
years," Kripke said. "And, I'm run-

ning for office be(;ause we need to 
speak up for what we believe in as 
a uni versi ty." 

The 56-year-old Kripke is not 
only a Medkal S(;hool professor, 
but also a practi cing physician, a 
Phi Beta Kappa graduate of 
Harvard college, and an M.D. from 
Columbia Medical School. He was 
a captain in the Air Force Medical 
Corps from 1966 to 1968, and has 
done research with the U.S. Air 
Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and 
NASA. Moreover, American 
Astronauts in 'pace used a medical 

instrument which he invented. 
. "I' ve also taught elective cours-

es for way over 20 years, even 
though I' ve never been paid out of 
tea(; hing funds, so I've been teach-
ing voluntarily," he said . 

Kripke said he has taught many 
types of students. 

"I've been teaching students, 
graduates, medical students and 
undergraduates and have employed 
students in my laboratory for many, 
many years," he said. "Some 
undergraduates have actually pub-
Ii hed scientific paper while work-

ing in my lahoratory." 
Politically, Kripke is running as 

a democrat in the 51 st di stri(;t , 
which indudes Northern San Diego 
County from Del Mar to Carlsbad 
and from Tierrasanta to Es(;ondido. 
Registration in this di ·trict is 50 
percent repUblican and only 30 per-
cent democratic. 

"My two main goals are to 
improve education and medical 
care, which I should have some 
experience to offer in Congress," 
Kripke said.

Medical School Issues Report 
NUMBERS: Underrepresented minority group increa e in thi year's cia s 
By Eleanor Kay 
GuardIan Reporter 

nderrepn.:sen teJ minority 
enrollment at the UCSD Schoo l of 
M edicine has both incn:ased and 
dec rCiised , accord ing to ncw ~ t a t is ­
til.:s releaseu by the sl,;hoo l last 
Thursday. 

The new stati,t ics indicate that 
the total numb.:r o f what the 
Arm:rican Association of Medi t.:al 
Colleges de line~ as underrepresent-
ed minoriti es Afri can 
American s, Mex ican Ameri cans, 
Nati ve Ameri cans and mainland 
Puerto Ri t.: ... ns - is up from two 
b st year to 10 for thi s fall. 

Additi onall y. the number of 
Caucasian studcnts dropped thi s 
ye ... r, from 68 students last year to 
65 students thi s year. The number 
of Asian American/Pacific Islander 
tudent s al so dropped from 48 stu -

dents last fall to 43 students thi s 
year. 

Linda Whitson, administrati ve 
anal yst for the Medical School, 
said that the number of appli t.:ants 
had dropped slightly but not signif-
icantly. 

"The statistical breakdown is 
better than last year." Whitson said. 
"However, we arc sti II trying to 
improve the diversity of the 
st.: hoo I. " 

Out of a pool of 4,627 appli-
t.:ants, UCSD accepted 295 applica-
tions, leading to a fin ... I class of 122 
students. The entering t.: lass con-
sists of 65 men and 57 women. 

The entering dass t.:ontains one 
Native Ameri can. three African 
Americans, six Mexican 
Americans, 43 A sian/Pac i fi c 
Islanders and 6S C ... ucasians (this 
category indudes nine East 
Indians). Four students chose not to 
identify their cthnicity. 

Forty- two undergraduate uni ver-
sities have students in the fall c lass. 
and numerous UC campuses arc 
repre!lented in that number. Ten stu-
dents in the cl ass attended UCSD. 

The GPA and the M CAT score 
of the arri v ing class also increased 
thi s year. 

"Our average G PA was 3.6!!." 
Whll!lon s ... rd, "and the average 
M CAT score was II ." 

Whitson said that applying for 

Mexico 
Australia 

"It is vital that the 
composition of a 
medical school class 
be diverse in all 
respects, in order to 
fulfill our commit-
ment to train physi· 
cians who will meet 
the widespread 
health needs of our 
community, and to 
ensure that the stu-
dents have an 
opportunity to learn 
and grow through 
interaction with 
their own peers." 

- John F. Alksne, M .D. 
Vice Chance llor of Health Sciences 

& Dean of School of Medicine 

any medical school is a stressful and 
competitive process. She said that in 
order l'or applicants to distinguish 
themsel ves from the countless others 
seeking spots in the incoming class, 
they must have activities and ex peri-
ent.:e on their resume that shows a 
multifaceted nature. 

"A common thread is that these 
student~ excel not only in their aca-
demics but also in other activities 
they are involved in sueh as sym-
phony orchestra, sports, etc .... 
Whitson said. " But an important 
aspect of the application is noting 
how much clinical experience such 
as vo lunteering in labs, hospitals, 
an applic ... nt has had." 

She s ... id that quantity is not the 
ill1port ... nt factor but the quality of 
t he ex periences ror the applicanb. 

A majority or thi s year's first-
yea r medical student s majored in 
bio logy or hiochemistry. hut there 
were a number of other ll1ajors rep-
resented such as environmental 
studies, physics. economics, 
Engli sh, international relati ons, 
music and history. Eleven students 
hold master, degrees and one holds 
a j uris doctoratc. 

John F. A lksne. UCSD vice 

chancellor of health scienccs and 
dean of the choo l of M edH: inc. 
said he wdL:omc, the acadcmit:

"This group of ~tlldc nt s i, we ll -

cine. and hnngs to the medica l 
o.c hoo l a hroad reprc,enra tion of 
hackgrollnd, and intae>I, ," Ite 
sa id. 

Alksne al so said that the diver,e 
hackgrounds of the students will 
contribute (0 their edlln lt ional 
experience. 

"It is vital thUi the composition 
of a medical school class be di verse 
in all respects, in order to fu lli ll our 
commitment to train phys icians 
who will meel the widespread 
heallh needs of our communit y. and 
to en ure that the students have an 
opportunity to learn and grow 
th rough interacti on with their own 
peers," Alksne said. 

The University o f Californi a 
also relcased statistics for all fi ve of 
its medical schools last Thursday. 
The report sl<lted that the number 
of Mexican -American/Chi cano.

Graduation Dissension 
Conducted with Respect 

As UCSO 's AII - ampus Commencement 
approached, protests and strong words swirled with 
the mention of the topic. The event appeared to be 
rife with potential for problems. Graduation sudden-
ly seemed to be no longer the day for UCSO and its 
students to shine; on the contrary, commencement 
looked like it was going to be the day UCSO was 
made into a national spectacle. 

Fortunately that scenario did not materiali ze. 
Those faculty, staff, students and graduates who 
marched out of the commencement ceremony did so 
in a fashion that drew attention to their objecti on to 
the choice or peaker of the U.S. Housc of 
Representatives Newt Gingrich at U SO as com-
mencement speaker. By refraining from any pro-
longed disruptive activities during the ceremony, thc 
protesters cnsured that other UCSO-commLlnity 
member ' attendi ng the event did not have their par-
ticipation in the ceremony and their memories or it 
marred . 

The Guardian would like to thank the demonstra-
tors for making their method of di ssension one that 
reflects the high quality or UCSO and it~ students. 
Thank you for making U SO's secund All -Campus 
Commencement an affair to remember - I'or good 
reasons. 

Financial Aid Recipients 
Targeted for Drug Use 

Next year 's higher education bill , which includes 
drug provisions, was recently passed by Congress and 
is currently awaiting President Clinton 's approval. 

If signed, the bill will suspend federal assistance 
for college students convicted of possessi ng or se lling 
illegal drugs. According to author U.S. Rep. Mark 
Souder (R-Ind.), the bill is meant to send a warning to 
America's young people that if they experiment with 
drugs, there will be calamitous consequences down 
the road. However, with just over 40 percent of pub-
lic university undergraduates and over 50 percent of 
private school undergraduates receiving some form of 
federal aid, the message isn' t intended for everyone. 

Under the higher education bill , only undergradu-
ates receiving financial aid are targeted for punish-
ment if convicted of possessing or selling illegal 
drugs, sending a message to n n-financial -aid recipi -
ents that this drug standard doesn't apply to them. As 
a result, not on ly is this bill inherentl y prejudiced, but 
it also duplicates un ex isting law denying federal 
benefits lO indi viduals convicted of a drug offense 
under federal or state law. 

If its goa l is to cut down on co llege-age drug LIse, 
Congress sh?uld use its resources to deter all col-
lege students from possess ing and selling illegal 
drugs, instead of si ngling out finan cial -aid n.:ci pi -
ents and th reatening to cut their ncce~sary educa-
tional fundin g.

The distance between

By Jessica Scheppmann 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students auending UC San Di.:go 
are hoth hlessed and cursed hy the 
aftluent neighhorhood of La Jolla that 
surrounds thi s academic paradis.:. 

Individuals looking forward to the 
relaxed, liberal atmosphere I' a college 
town are usually disappointed once they 
arrive in Ll Jolla. While communities 
such as Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Santa 
Cruz, Davis, Irvi ne and Ri verside drdw 
much of their atmosphere from the pres-
ence of the college and the students, La 
Jolla prefe rs 10 prevent anything that 
resembles typical college behavior. 

At other schools, students enjoy 
lu xuries like ample college housing, 
inexpensive dining, a fra ternity/sorori-
ty row. late-night fast food and a 
r'laxed soci al environlTIent. all 
plopped down in the middle of a W Ill -

Other schools proVide am pk proof 
that sm:ial deprivation is not net:essary 
for academk s u(;ce~~. and that a con-
~ervative environment docs not nece,-

wide spectrum or interests. Part of the 
reas n thi s is possihle is be(;ause of the 
liberal atmosphere that fosters free 
thought and ex pression . The other rea-
son is alumni support , which is proba-
bly ti ed to their Division 1 standing, 
but that's another ani l; le. 

UC Lo~ Angeles, situated in 
Westwood, also enjoys a neighborhood 
that is geared toward supporti ng its stu-
dents. Within walking distance arc cof-
fee houses, student-oriented shops and 
low-priced entertainment. Whi Ie 
UCSD docs enjoy the presence of 
plu(;es like the Grove Cale and Roma, 
we aren't fortunate enough to enjoy 
di versity in our seicctions. Most stu-
dents seeking a welcoming atmosphere. 
once again , have to look elsewhere. 

Our neighhor, San Diego State 
Uni vcrsity, is a hetter example of a uni -
versit y with a typica l college-town 
atmosphere. Although SDS docs not 
havc our academic standing, it is sti ll an 
excellent school that allows for a

ENDING SOCIAL PROMOTION r---------------------· I I 
COMMENTARY: 
Assembly Bill 1626 
will improve public 
education and UCSD's 
incoming ' tudents 
By Jeffrey Barker 
ASSOCiate Opinion Editor 

Watch for the ca ll her 01 CSD 
~tudents 10 ri sc. thanks 10 a move 
by Gov. Pete Wilson. 

He and local State 
Assemblyman Howard Wayne (D-
San Diego) ha ve put an end 10 
sot:ia l promotion in California puh-
li e schoob. We can thank hoth 
Wayne. who authored the 
Assembly Bill 1626, and Wilson, 
who signed it into law. I'or further 
expos ing the rock-bollom condi-
tion of our , tal!; school system. 

For 100 long. California schoo l 
teachers have feared givi ng "F' 
gradcs more than their students 
have feared rc(;civing them. ot 
wanting to shatter a l:hild's self-
esteem, educators have held hack 
on the red ink and promoted u nde-
servmg student s. This has created 
"so(; ial promotion" - a practice 
SiKri ficing education for a student 's 
place among hi s or her p.:ers. 

"AB 1626 gives teachers the 
authority to determine if a chi Id is 
ready to he promoted tn the nex t 
grade," Wi Ison said during a recent 
visi t 10 La Ballona Elementary 
chool in ul ver City. Calif. 

The authorit y is so mething 
schools and educators already 
have. The law will take that author-
it y and force teachers tn use it 
properly. 

It 's apparent that public educa-
ti on is at an absurd low when laws 
need to be madc forci ng educators 
not to promote students if they can-
not do the math. It 's olle prohlem 10 
have 70 percent of Los Angeles 
third-graders reading below grade 
level. and another to promote them 
and hand out fourth-grade course 
work after a SUlllilier vacation . 

"No longer wi II promoti on to 
the nex t grade he as automatic as a 
hlrt hday," Wilson ~aid . 

Being held hat:k in school is cer-
tainly tryi ng lor young :..tudents.

For too long, 
California school 
teachers have 
feared giving "F" 
grades •••• Not 
wanting to shatter a 
child's self-esteem, 
educators have held 
back on the red ink 
and promoted 
undeserving 
students. So we get 
"social promotion," 
a practice sacrificing 
education for a 
student's place 
among his or her 
peers. 
good job is mudl worse. 

Like the rest of Wil~on 's 
Education Renaissance, a long-
term plan for improving 
California 's publi c s(;hoois, AB 
1626 i ~ lIot a vision for the futu rc . 
It is com mon sense that SdlOOb 
should have heen using all along. 

The bill forces California school 
districts 10 adopt promotion and 
retention :..pe(;ifics. These spedlics 
wi II he used to te~t students regu-
larly and 10 ideillify children in 
danger of heing detained from the 
next grade level. The law also 
holds sl: hool di stricts and county 
boards of education responsihle for 
promot ion and retention . 

Other items In Wilson's 
Education Renaiso;ance ar~e nal arc 
a reduction in c1a~s size, a return to 
reading hasics and a Ciwner 
SChOll I program. 

More than a renais~anl:e, man y 

of the new la ws arc si mply a 
reminder of problem~ sl:hoois 
should have aln:ady been auack-
ing. 

AB 1626 also requires an expla-
nation from a teacher promoting a 
student whu ha, not performed 
well on a statewide exam or has not 
met the schuu l district\ require-
ment , for promotion. In writi ng, 
teachers mu>! justify the promotion 
of slUdents through grad's two 
th rough li vc and from grade sdlool 
to middle ~c ho() l , and middle 
srhoolto high school. 

The governor signcd the ami-
~ocial promot ion bi II at La Ballona 

lementary, supposedly a Model 
. chool for the state of California. 
Yet, even there, two-thirds of stu-
dents r.:ad helow the nationa l aver-
agl.! . In addition, on ly two to thrl!e 
La Ballona students are held back 
each yea r (La.l· AlIgeieI 7 illle.\· , 

ept. 24 , 1<)<)8, "Anti -' Sodal 
Promotion' Bilb Signed"). 

Signing AB 1626 into law is 
treading hetwel' n the few a~pects of 
puhlic lik where government regu-
iJtes ilml the va~t majority where 
government illlervention ~hou ldn ' t 
be nece~sary. 

By ranking las t, or close to lasl. 
on 100 many national survey:.. , 
California 's puhlic schools have 
sent a mcssage that intervention is 

ne~essary. The legislation can onl y 
improve the quality of the students 
produced by the state school sy~-
tem.

STUDENT GETS MARRIED AND GOES SHOPPING 
COMMENTARY: It 's 
hard to be picky when 
marriage and college 
empty your po kets 
By Megan Smith 
Sentor Staff Wflter 

sua lly ~ummcr comlsts 01 
endless days of pleasure, sitllng 
and relaxing under the warm sun Ul 
the beach, pool or your local body 
of water. They arc st rcss-free days 
with not hing to worry annul. 

Then there was my summer -
day after day of stressing and wor-
rying about the mi ll ion dctaib of 
my wedding. 

But my fami ly and I pu lled it 
off. The wedding came; it was a 
beauti ful day, it was a heautiful 
wedding and the planning or it was 
beautirullyover. 

A few days after the wedding, 
my new hushand, Mark , and I trav-
eled in a caravan down 1-5 to San 
Diego. We arri ved at our new apart-
ment with barely enough time to 
shove all of our hoxes in the comer 
and prepare for the stress of schoo l. 

The stress never ends. 
The funn y thing ahout mnv ing 

into a new apanment is that it usu-
ally docs not come with the refri g-
erator fully stocked. Since refri ger-
ated foods don ' t rea II y travel very 
well, that means our cuphoards 
werc hare, and the onl y food in the 
apartment was chocolate and 
champagne (leftovers from a pic nic 
my mom had packed for us). Add 
the stress of having no food! II was 
time to go grol:cry shopping. 

Let me explai n the significilnce 
thi s activity has for me. 

I have a great appreciation for 
fine food. I am very interested and 
exci ted about the preparat ion and 
presentation of a gourmct meal. So 
when I go gro<.:ery shoppi ng, I 
don't just throw a few apple. a box 
of macaroni and cheese and a 
frolen la.,agna in Illy cart and rush 
OUI. I take my ti me. 

Il ingcr over thc fi ne c hee~e sec-
tion, hrowsing hc tween the gouda, 
the hries and the mizithra . I try to 
select a lew chee~c~ to he paired 
with a hox of water crackcrs as an 
appetizer for that evening's meal. 

I am not a ~tranger in the 
seafood section of the local Vons. I 
might purcha~e a pound of shrimp 
to he used in a pasta dish later that 
week. A trou t steak may ti nd its 
way into my can, as well as a few 
fresh <.:rab legs. 

The fru its and vegetahles sec-
tion <.:an provide a number of dis-
coveries. I have hcen introduced to 
many unusual and del icious types 
of squash while browsing between 
the broccoli and the cauliflower. 
Speaking of those two vegetuhlcs, 
they arc less likely to make it into 
my can than are asparagus, avoca-
dos or portahcllo mushrooms. 

I enjoy trying new vari eties of 
lellUl:e (I decided I don't re.lIly like 
endi ve) and mayhe cho<)sing an 
exoti <.: fruit to take home with me. I 
also never forget to grah a hunch or 
fn.:sh hems to season that evening's 
dinner. 

I can he ve ry picky ahout 
hreads. I will never purchase whe;lt 

We cannot afford 
lunch meat. We have 
tuna and peanut 
butter and jelly 
instead. Our cereal 
came in a bag - no 
box. Our ground 
beef was in a long 
plastic tube, and we 
compared the Jam at 
price per ounce to 
figure out which 
was the cheapest. 
unless it is 100 percent whole 
wheat and has a heavy feel. I rarely 
pick up a loaf of white unless it is a 
good quality white, not the kind 
that squish down into a dough hall 
the second you touch it. 

Baguettes and other french 
hreads also have a spe<.: ia l sign ifi -
<.:ance for me. I prefer sourdough 
with ;\ ve ry hard crust. I have 
noticed that this has been especial-
ly difficult to find at grocl.:ry stores 

in San Diego. It i~ a rare occasion 
that I will find a nice frc h loaf to 
bring home. 

t3u\ically, I illn very picky about 
the foods I 'a t. I figure that if I 
have to cat. I Inlght a, wel l cat deli-
cious food. 

Thi s lat e~ t grocery store trip 
wa~ a turnll1g point for me. 

Put the <.:oncept of poor, l:o llege 
student in your head. Gal it'/ OK, 
now add the word married to that 
des<.:ription. See all that money 
fa ll ing out of the ~tuden t 's pockets'! 
There you go, that is a good image 
of ahout how much moncy we 
have. Yippie, added stress of hav-
ing no money. 

We an.: so poor that instead of 
driving, we wa lked to the grocery 
storc and haukd a huge, overflow-
ing grocery can bllCk to our apart-
ment to save money on gas. I am 
not sure it was even worth it, 
hecause people in ca rs were laugh-
ing at us as we tried to push the 
loaded can across the street. That 
isn' t even the worst pan . 

For th is shopping trip the objec-
ti ve wasn't to find the finest foods, 
it was to find the cheapest. 

So with greal sadness, we didn' t 
even glance at the i mporl ed 
cheeses, we grahbed a package of 
Alhertson's mild <.: heddar and a 
package of Monterey jad and 
moved on. We couldn 't even afford 
sharp du:ddar - which, for those 
of you who don' t know, is more 
expensive than mild . 

We bought the cheapest fruit , 
the cheapest lelluce and the 100-
pound bulk hag of potatoes that is 

$5 cheaper than the one-pound bag. 
Our bread wa~ a IouI' uf _qulshy 
white bread and wheat hread (not 
100 percent whole wheat) on ,pc-
clJ I at two for \19 cent,. 

We threw a hag of appb. four 
hoxes of macaroni and chee~c and 
twO frolen la\agna, in out can. 

We canno\ afford lunch meat. 
We have tuna and peanut hutler and 
jelly instead. We did nOi purchase 
any name hra nds. our cupboard, 
on ly contain Albertson 's branJ 
food . 

Our cereal came in a bag - no 
box . Our ground beef was in a long 
plastic tube, and we compared the 
jam at price per ounce to ligure out 
which was the cheapest. 

We did not buy any frozen hash 
browns or <.:u rly fries - rememher 
the bag of potatoes'! We are making 
those from scratch. 

It took twice as long to shop 
because with everything we bought 
we had to make absolute ly sure we 
had chosen the cheapest option. 

But we did il. We saved $25.64 
with "Bonus Buys" and probabl y 
about SO cents on gas, but it wasn' t 
a sati sfying trip. It was full o f 
stress. 

I wi II miss the days of baked 
hrie before a dinner of lell1on-aml-
hcrh encrusted salmon with key 
lime pie for dessert. Now my din-
ner consists of macaroni and 
cheese with salt ines. 

Oh, I will survive the stress of 
being poor and havin g to buy 
chcap-o food. hut if you ever want 
to take us )ut to dinner, pick us up 
at seven. You' re driv ing, right '!

BASEBALL NEEDS A HERO, NOT A SAVIOR 
COMMENTARY: 
McGwire shatters 
records, but baseball 
can hold its own 
By Alan E, Wirzbickl 
Harvard Cnmson (Harvard U.J 

AMBRIDGE, Ma~~. - Amid 
the hoopla surrou nding Mark 
McGwire\ new major ' league 
home run record, the ~age~ of tli l! 
national pa,ume arc unanimou~ nn 
one thing. McGwire, they say, ha~ 
saved ha,cball. 

Writing in Sport.1 flllI.I·(fllled, 
Tom Verducci declared th at 
McGwire "ha, rekindled the coun-
try's interest in haseha ll. " Peter 
Gammon" the normall y re,erved 
analyst for ES PN and The BU.1'11I11 
Globe, wrote that "in th is season ... 
hasehall regained one generation 
and ga ined ano ther that some fe ll 
never would turn It , 
MTVfNintendo eyc\ ." 

McGwire isn't the first man to 
save haseball in the la, t few year, . 
Sometime around 1995, the phra,e 
"good for the game" entered the 
vocahulary of spons commentators 
and has lingered ever si nce to 
honor those admirahle player, who 
have taken it upon themselves to 
save the sport. 

Ca l Ripken Jr. saved the game 
in 1995 , when he passed Lou 
Gehrig 's re(;ord for consecut i ve 
games played at 2, 130. The nex t 
year, the New Yurk Yankees again 
saved the game from imminent 
demise, pulling toget her a scrappy 
and inspiJational team of rookies.

ant ve teran, to e.: laim the World 
Series crown. The illness of Yankee 
manager Joe Torre'~ brother Frank 
provided a dramatic suhplot. I have 
no dnuht that the next underdog to 
win ,I World Serie~ , the next player 
to hreak MJme hallowed mark. will 
be duly hailed a~ the game\ newc,t 
... a VIOl'. 

But Irom what exact ly i~ hase· 
hall bei ng saved? What dire thn:at 
requires McGwire and Ripken to

anyone knows. The standard 
an,wcr is that the lingenng acrimo· 
ny from the IlJ94 player\ strike -
which caused the World Serie, to 
he call1:c1ed for the first time since 
IlJ04 - '>till plagues the game. and 
that more generally. as Gaml1lom. 
wrote, our genera t ion ha; ahan· 
doned the nati onal pastime for 
electroni c entertainment. or worse 
yet, other sport;. 

Thi , sce nano simpl y isn't the 
casco While the strike wa; a devas· 
tating hlow to many fans, its e ffects 
ha ve heen neit her as deep nor as 
dire as the media purported. 
Basehall is ill ·servcd hy having 
each new , tar anointed the game 's 
mess iah. 

To he sure, the national pastimc 
has ,een heller days. Greedy play· 
ers. the disparity betwcen small -
and large·market teams and com· 
peti tion from other sport s has erod· 
ed the supremacy of haseball in the 
nat ional consc iousness. Football. 
and sometimes hasketball. fini she; 
ahead of basehall in polls of spom 
popularity.

. . 

the next underdog 
to win a World 
Series, the next 
player to break 
some hallowed 
mark, will be duly 
hailed as the game's 
newest savior. 
But from what 
exactly is baseball 
being-saved? What 
dire threat requires 
MeGwlre and Ripken 
to stave it off? 

Sino: the '50s - the era Ken 
Burn; and Boh Costas would have

inroads int o the poo l of athletes 
where hasehall used to have first

Still . the game remai ns remark-
ably popular. Attendance rehound ·

strike. Average attendance" now

than el'er hefore. Player, from the 
Carlhhean . South America and 
Japan play in the maJor,. rai;ing

Among the much maligned 
MTVI intendo generati on (that \ 
us), the level of interest in baseball 
i; not w .. tepid as the haseha ll pun· 
ditocracy ,eelm to believe. The 
diamonds continue to till with little

Baseha ll can "always usc home

is w mething more w mplex than a

ultimately will survive on its own

Mark McGwin:'s significance 

to basehall should not be down-
played. He has broken - indeed. 
shattered - one of the most sacred 
and endu ring marks of baseha ll and 
has hrought excitement to a season 
bereft of pennant races . But he 
should not he elevated to so mc· 
thing greater than he is. He is a 
great ballpl ayer. a hero to millions, 
but not a savior. The game can take 
care of it se lf.

Speaking as someone whose little

seem that the money from the sur-

Without thi s diversi ty to 
counter the inherent conservati ve 
views that seem to go hand in hand

the co-op sclb books cheaper than the 
hookstore. But here's the kicker. 
'nlcre" also a place on the Internet 
called BigWordsxom that sell s its 
hooks cheaper than the bookstore, has 
more titles than the General Store. 

First of all , I would like to thank 
the General Store for it s tireless 
devoti on to the pocketbooks of the 
students of UCSD. However, even 
the Genera l Store will admit it 
unfortunatel y doesn' t ha ve the 
rc,ourccs tn bring in ( i tl e~ for every 
class. Nor C~1I1 it cont inually stock 
huge pi b of the h{)ok~ it se lb at 
the heginning of each quarter. 

So now wt: have an a lternative, 
which, as I ar ." I t:an te ll , is on par 
with the Genera l Store in terms of 
price an<l hcat~ it interim of ,,;: Iec-
tion. eedk,s to ~ay, this hlows the 
bookstore out of the water. 

For example: SE 105. ' 'Theory 
of Computation" by Michael 

ipser. (Pretty ohscure hook, sorry 
Dr. Sipser) 

has cxpres>ed con-
cems about the men-

tal healt h of its students. ACl:ording to 
thl.!se ,amc rum rs, n.:s idcnti al lire 
fears that its studenb may ~tudy too 
much and arc losing a healthy sense 
of individuality. 

I've heard thM n:sident ia l life 
suggests act iVit ies like huild ing , tuff 
on your balcony. But, I don't think 
they ' re talking ahout very heavy 
stu ff since that is explicitl y prohihit-
cd in the Warren Co llege Handbook. 
I' ve al so heard that there's a new 
rul e explicitly prohibiting the con-
stru t: ti on of spas on halconies. I 
wonder what that 's about. Anyway, I 
think they're also suggesting some-
thing to promote suite cohesivene,s 
- something eVl.!ryone in the , uite 
w uld pitch in and help with. 

A fcw suggestions havc I:ome 
Illy way. A modified ~lI r condition-

CHRISTIAN RIGHT PREACHES HETEROSEXUALITY 
COMMENTARY: 
Religious group runs 
ads looking to cure 
homosexual i ty 
By Doug Osoba 
Daily Targum (Rutgers U.) 

NEW BR 'SWICK. .1 . -
This pa,t summer. in full -page 
adven isemenh pl'l\;ed in wide ly 
read newspapers such as USA 
Tot/ay and The New York Tillles , the 
Chris tian Right initi aled its new 
campaign ad voca t i ng c()n ver~ion 
from homosexuality to hetero..;ex u-
ality. 

As proof of thi s regurgi tation of 
an old formul a, thi ad fea tured 
"ex"-holllosex ual indi vidual s and 
couples dec laring that th.:y had 
shed the error of their ways and 
found happiness in heterosexual 
marriage , with. of course, ~ hildren, 
.' dog called Spot, a lillIe house in 
the 'hurns, and a cute white pi l:kct 
fence. Eal:h underwent "conversion 
ther;lpy." a form of counseling 
where the therapist provides the 
"needed" figure of a strong role 
model th at the patient never had 
during child hood. 

Having apparently "cured" 
thousands of fonner homosexuals, 
thi s new therapy is being hailed as 
a means of becoming a fully initiat -

ed member of the Christi an com-
munity, capable of self-love and 
pe rsonal fu lfi llment. However, th is 
, upposedly LI n the fo refront coun-
,eling is nothi ng more than a last -
di tl:h effort hy the Christian Right 
to hrain\ ash those they view as 
unde, irahle and is a, pluusih le and 

rea l i>l l ~ as the pate nt of a pt:rpetual 
moti on machi ne. 

Tu , ta n. the succes, ratc \11' Ihis 
therapy is undouhtedl y fl awed. 
Whi Ie many proponents of the ther-
apy cla im it works. thl: pe rcent -
ages, given h actu al practitioners, 
clearly suggest otherwise. 

To pUI the success rate in per-
spective, you must imagi ne the 
mindset of the person who would 
willingly suhjcl:t thcmselves to th is 
kind of procedure: di spirited, 
depressed and seemingly helpless 
gay men and women who are ycarn-
ing for anything that will alleviate a 
sense of claustrophohia and sci 1'-
hatred: some are likely sui cidal. Th is 
treatment is clearly a last resort. 

However, even with these "will -
ing" parlicipants, the likelihood of 
a clear change of orientation is only 
30 percent. In the conditions given 
ahove. the same therapy, applied to 
heterosexuals (something never 
attempted), would likely produce 
the same results . 

Moreover, the value of conver-

In addition, hy impl ying that

Christian Right is returning to a 
notion shed in 1973 by Ihe American 
Psychiatric Association that being 
anything other than heterosexual is a 
mental illness. eed we sec a Salelll-

In its mission statement about 
conversion therapy, Focus on the 
Fami Iy, a far right-wing 
political/religious organizati on, 

Carlsbad 

states that it onl y wants to take the 
misery of promiscuity, drug abuse, 
sickness and poor menial health 
away from the homosexual commu-
ni ty. The,c arc. indeed, admi rablc.

di'L'!I~c whi le the Chri stian Ri ght 
and its ideological companions fai l 
to unuer>land that they have consis-
tently undermined each and every 
lj uality that we l!dve . 

From childhood th rough adu lt -
hood, gay men and women have 
had to li sten to the damning noise 
churning th rough the machine of 
propaganda and ignorance. They 
have heard that they arc going to 
he ll , going to berome twisted psy-
chos, child molesters or somc other 
form of assorted human crap am.! 
wonhlcss leeches of society. 

What else can result from such 
verbal ballery, vomiting rorth from 
the mouths of those they should 
supposedly respect '! Perhaps it 
could be the low se lf-esteem, self-
hatred and demoralization that lead 
to the same misery that the 
Christian Rig ht wishes 10 eradicate. 

The Christian Right should Ipok 
at the hand of conlentious l:ards it 's 
holding, gamble away its hypocrisy 
and then fold . It 's the only thing to 
do ror God's sake.

Editor: 

This leller is in response 10 Ms.

summer experi ence in England 
("Playful Summer." Gllardian .

I had hoped lhal some of her

reply. 

My experience abroad in 
England appears 10 have been radi-
cally differenl. I attribute thi s 10 an 
open mind and desire 10 learn about

uinely considerate to those whom 
lhey l:are abou!. You would not 
rind a British student shouting 
"Hi !" across a quad. si mply 
because lhey see someone they 
recognize. 

As for Ms. Senul y's observation 
thaI the word toi lel is ralher 10 lhe 
poinl . il is called as SUdl hecause 
lhere is nOlhing else in lhe room. 
There is no shower. bath or place to

at heart , I suggesl lhe lerm 100. 

Furthermore. who arc we 10 

make judgmenl aboul anOlher 
eounlry \ diet? Whilst I would not 
choose 10 ha ve a fry -up every 
morning. accompanied by a wrry 
and lage r in the evening. il i~ 'afc 
to say lhal America is lhe mo~l 
obese nalion in lhe world . 

We may he obse~sed wilh inane

intake and saturaled fat grams, bUl 
at leasl lhe British know how 10 
enjoy lheir meal. NOI once did I see 
a male or'mine examine lhe nUlri-
tional fal:l S on lhe ~ idc of some 
box . 

Once again , we need 1o look 
bey nd label ' and learn nol 10 
judge lhings hy lheir I:over. As a 
side poinl. if eholeslerol is such a 
l:oncem. then why did Ms. Senuly 
choose 10 go to McDonald 's? (By 
lhe way. the $4 hamburger is a 
resull of the exchange rale, nol 
some crazy Brils lrying to rip visil-
ing Americans of I) 

These poinls may seem lrivial, 
bUl looking al lhe bigger picture I 
really feel like Senuty missed lhe 
poinl of studying and living 
abroad. As we move into another 
counlry, we should not compare 
and weigh fal: 10 rs againsl one

learn lhal cu llure cannot be consid-
ered as heller or worse. bUl instead.

Professor: 'Misdemeanor' Clause Could Harm Clinton 
DUKE: Wording of Constitution may determine whether the president could be removed from office 
By Jason Wagner 
The Chronicle {Duke U.J 

DURHAM . N. . - In a pile of 
videotapes, photographs and 
papers. the evi dence presented by 
Independent Co unse l Kenneth 
Starr anout -President Bi II 
Clinton's alleged sexual impropri-
ety has come to overshadow a 
much smalle r doc ument whi ch 
may ultimately dec ide C; linton's 
fate. As discussion turns from the 
detail s of ClinlOn's alTa ir with for-
mer White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky to how he should be 
punished, politica l ex perts are 
once aga in poring over the 
Constitution, which outlines the 
process by which the Pres ident 
could he renioved from offi ce. 

'l'hc president , vice president 
and all dvil o rti cers of the United 
States , shall be removed from 
office on impeachment for, and 
conviction of. treason, bribery, or . 
other hi gh crimes and misde-
meanors," states Article I. Section 
IV. Impeachment articles are 
always presented in the House of 
Representati ves with convicti on 
and removal from olfice carried out 
hy the Senate. 

But this is almost all the 
Constitut ion says about the issue, 
leav ing spe<.: ifil: grounds for 
impeachment open to interpreta-

tion. Unsurpri singly. then, both 
sides of the current debate now 
<.:harge that the issue may be dis-
torted hy <.:ompeting politica l goals. 
Partisan votes allegedl y decided 
the re lease of much of the sensit ive 
Lewinsky-related ev idence. and 
Clinton 's harshes t critics come 
fro m the Republi can party. But 
Willi am Van Alstyne, William and 
Thomas Perkins professor of law. 
says that the prOl.:esses of impeach-
ment are not always governed hy 
polit ical motives. 

Instead, he said impeachment 
cases depend on speci fi e interpreta-
tions of the law. 

Although he said the wo rd 
"mi sdemeanor" - written in the 
18th century to mean an a<.: t that 
shames or embarrasses a public 
offi ce - could be applied to the 
C.iinton case, Van Alstyne cau-
tioned lawmakers against applying 
it without cardul consideration. 

"[ think it 's important that the 
Congress not too ex travagantly 
detl ne the noti on of a high misde-
meanor." he said. "because then it 
would be political." 

But Van Alstyne said he 
believes that "hi gh crimes" may 
prove a stronger basis for impeach-
ment hearings. "There is potential 
evidence that the Pres ident did 
[<.:o mmit] felony offenses such as

"With respect to the 
Starr report, I think 
It's hard to believe, 
for some people, 
that the President 
did not perjure him-
self. [But on the 
charges of obstruc-
tion of justice] 
there doesn't seem 
to be a whole lot of 
evidence and [there] 
appears to be con-

Although Van Alstyne thinks it 

likely that Clinton will prevail and 
keep his ofll ce. he says, "The coun-
try would be i II-se rved if' [Congress

whether or not articles of impea\:h-

ical science, said wranglings over 
the legal definiti ons are mirrored 
by the public's uncertainty about 
the prm;ess and its implications. 
This un\:~ rt ai nty may playa ro le in 
determ ining poll r~su lts . 

Based on the politi cal climate, 
Pall.: tl. speculated. "At thl.: moment 
it looks as if h' wi ll not resign, and 
even if he is impeached, he wi ll 
probably not be convicted." 

The meaning or the word 
"other" may be crit ica l to int l.: 'lJre· 
tat ions of the phrase "treason, 
hri hery. or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors," he noted. Does the 
word imply that "other" impeach-
able offenses include only those on 
a similar scale to treason and 
bribery? The question is a legal 
one, but th~ public may have 
already made its decision. 

"There's an assumption here 
that other means high crimes and 
misdemeanors like hi gh treason 
and bribery," Paletz says. 

Jefferson Powell, a professor in 
the law and di vinity schools, urged 
Congress to consider the decision· 
on both a moral and a legal level. 

"We all know that the president 
has tried to mislead us. Nothing 
that the Independent Counsel has 
done has added to thaI. It 's not by 
itself a crime," he said. Refusing to 
pass judgment , Powell maintained

"There 's no law against being a bad 
person." 

Legally, Clinton may also be on 
surer fOOl ing than hi ' crit ics claim. 
"With r~spect to the Starr report . I 
think it 's hard to hcli ev~, lor 'ome 
people, t hat the President did not 
perjure himself," Powell said. But 
on the charges of obstructi on of 
j usti<.:e. Powell said "there doesn't 
seem to be a who le lot of evidence 
and Ithere l appears to be contradi<.:-
lOry evidence that he got olher peo-
ple to lie." 

But most experts agree that the 
President would have little chance 
for a successful legal appeal if 
impeachment 'articles are presented 
and the Senate convicts, a move 
that wou Id be unprecedented in 
American history. 

Van Alstyne noted that if the 
court reviewed the case aft er 
Congress had voted to remove 

linlOn from offi ce, it could create 
a situation of politica l chaos 
because presidential succession 
would become unclear. "The 
Supreme Court would probably be 
relu<.: tant to second-guess the action 
by Congress" Van Alstyne said. 

Powell agreed. "There is a 
strong view that a decision by the 
House to impeach would be a final 
decision. It would 'urprise me if 
the couns would review it."

CONGRESS: 
Kri pke ran for 
Congres previously 
Continued from page 1 

Kri pke also said he has di fferent 
goa ls than hi s opponent Republican 
incumhent Randy Duke 
Cunningham. 

' 'I'm interested in im;reasing 
Pell g rants and increasing work 
study and othe r assistance for the 
student s," he said. "Mr. 
Cu nningham voted time and time 
again agai nst the educati on appro-
priation, and the health and human 
service, approrriation. He voted 

again~t increases in Pell granb, 
which go directly into the pockets 
of UCSD students. He also tried to 

di~continue the ,chool IUllch pro-
gram and most federa l programs 
for younger kids in school." 

Cunningham alsu introduced 
legis lation to reduce the funding of 
the National Institutes of Healih, 
Kripke sa id. 

" You have to understand what 
that means for UCSD, which gets 
maybe a quarter or a thi rd of its 
health budget from the ational 
Institutes of Hea lth," Kripke ~ai d . 
"Many students get their sa laries 

and uni ve rsi ty jobs from the 
ational Institutes of Health fund-

ing. 
"You have tu reali ze what it 

mean ' for graduate students, who 
get their tipends from ati onal 

In~t i tutes of Health funding , and 
what it means for the undergra lu-
ate who hopes to enter u career in 
medicine or biology and would sec 
their ~areers ~ut off if the in~ulll ­
hent had his way," he added. 

"So it's a li ght bet ween a doctor 
who's reall y been working for edu-
cation and medical care for many 
years and an incumbent who'~ try-
ing to cut back the very programs 
which support UCS D students now 
and which arc the hopes of their 
future." he continued . 

Kripke advocates c leaning and 
resanding our beaches, educating 
K-12 students more heavi ly in 
computers, easi ng traffic conges-
tion with computer technology, 
keeping the budget balanced. and 
promoting women's rights such as 
reprudut:ti ve choice and equal pay. 

He pub li dy criticized the U.S. 
avy aftcr a 1996 mercury spililhat 

cost morc than I million to clean 
up. At the time, Kripke hought TV 
ads to demand that the Navy clean

Kripke, a p isonous doud would 
sprcad over Ihe region. 

He won only 28 percent of the 
vote in the primary, whi le 
Cunningham won 67 percent. 

''The process or challengi ng an 
inwmbent is a matter of letting 
people know who I am and what I 
stand for, and then I can win," 
Kripke said. "So it's a Illaller of 
communicilting, which every day 
and every week we do more and 
Illore of." 

Kripke said that others can help 
hUll communicatc his message by 
c-mai ling their friends. 

"If every student would send an 
c-mail message to everybody on

PUB: Fake I.D,s U ed 
as deterrent for underaged 
drinking at UCSD 
Continued f rom page 1 

Porter 's Pub, in pUrlicular, is known for 
co nli~( ating phony dri ve r's licenses and dis-
playing Ihem on the wall ncxt 10 the heer taP~ . 

"We post the rake lO's as a deterrem," 
Porter said . 

Porter added Ihal in additi on to providing 
rood and beverages, having a pub on campus 
is an advamage 10 thc university because it 
allows studenl s to drink in a supervised, con -
trollcd environment. 

Yet Ihe issue of alcohol use - particularly 
the il legal consumption or alcohol in resi -
dence hall s - continues to tr ublc authori-
ties. For underage studenls who choose to 
drink, akohol consumption occurs illici tly 
and someti mes dangerously behind dosed 
doors . 

According to UCSD Police Ol'ficer Alan 
Jenkins, four students suffered from alcohol 

poi~oning during Ihe first week of classes 
alone. 

'That is as many as we usually see 
Ih ro ughout the en lire year," Jenkins said. 
"We' re ofT to a terrible start." 

In addi ti on to alcohol poisoning - which 
can be fatal - one studen t was transported to 
San Diego County 's DelOxilication Center. 
and anot her, was cited for public drunkenness. 

"You have 10 drink responsibly," Jenkins 
said . "And that's not what we're seeing." 

Wahlig , Jenkins and ot her camp us 
authoriti es sa id that college students 
demonSlrate -a hi gh incidence or binge 
drinking, deli ned as consuming rour or 
more drinks per si lting (five for men). In a 
1993 sludy done by Southern Ill inois 
UniversilY 's Cenler for Alcohol and Other 
Drug Stud ies (CORE), 44 percenl of the 
subjects surveyed had binged within the 
previous two week '. 

Accordi ng to Debbie Pi no-Saballett. 
UCSD's Student Health Outreach coordina-
tor, .excessive drinking is definitely a problem 
here at UCSD. 

"Some people look al intoxication as 
something to brag about," Pino-Saballett said . 

. "Is this sti II social drinking, or is it a prob-
lem'!" 

Wahlig said that binge drinking also puts 
students at risk for sexual assault, accidental 
injury and ballery. Of 567 U SO students 

John Barber I GuardIan 

wr\'cyed in 1997 for a ~ urvey on undcrgradu -
ale alcohol abuse and it s correlation to vio-
lence, 17 pen:ent rc~ponded Ihat they had 
been sexually assaulted aflcr partl cipaling in 
binge drinking. 

"People drink until they' re sick." Pino-
Saballelt said. "They don' t think it can get 
that bad ." 

Although uncertain about what drives col -
lege student s 10 cx ce~s. Pino-Sabellell ~aid 
that slress. depression or boredom Illay play a 
signilicant role . Friends al so have difficulty 
telling each other when to quit drinking 
because of peer pressure, Wahlig added . 

Wahlig and Pino-Saballell currently work 
with the Commillec for Alcohol and 
Substance Abuse (CASA), a campus group 
consisting of students, college deans, police 
officers and alcohol peer counse lors among 
others. 

In September 1997, CASA received a 
grant of $ 180,000 from the Federal 
Deparlment of Education to research and 
develop a prevention program on campus. 
Wahli g said there are seven UCSD students at 
work on the project. 

"Wc are taking an environmental manage-
ment approach," Wahlig said. "We look at 
what policies are already in place and ask if 
they are effective." 

In terms of law enforcement. Jenkins said 
that UCS D provides lighter security than 
many un iversi ties. In addition to the on-cam-
pus police department, each college is 
patrolled by a Residence Security Oflicer 
(RSO) . 

"RSOs are there to enforce the rules, as 
well as to prevent crime," Jenkins said . 
"Perhaps hecause of our RSOs, UCSD has 
always maintained a low cri me rate." 

However, studenls somclimcs complain 
that current policies on campus are unfair or 
100 striclly enforced . 

"RSOs go looking for problems," Aaron 
Rozenek, a third-year student at Warren col-
lege, said. "They almost create problems out 
of nothi ng." 

Alcohol "busts" are most frequent during 
the first week of school and at large evenl s 
such as the annual Sun God Festival, Jenkins 
said. During last year's festival, Rozenek was 
written up by an RSO for throwing a party in 
his on-campus apartment. . 

" It is an unrealistic expectation to stop 
students from drinking," Rozenek said . 
"Drinking is a fact uf lire on campus. It is [the 
students' l choice to do it responsibly."

SRAs Stage Protest 
CONTROVERSY: UPTE voice di content with lack of pay rai e 
in lighl of Chancellor Robert Dyne ' 18 percent salary increa e 

Oave Lub,tz/ GuardIan 
Plea: Maya Kalmijn (right). daughter of UPTE president Jelger Kalm ijn, watches an 
informational picket held by UPTE members on Tuesday morning. 

Xi-Min Sung 
Senior Staff Writer 

Members of Universi ty Professionals and 
Technical Employees (U fYfE) demonstrated 
last Tuesday to express dissatisfaction with 
their pay and thei r discontent with Chancellor 
Robert Dynes, who recei ved an I II percent 
pay raise last. month. 

UfYfE is currently seeking resolution with 
the University of Califomia in ongoing nego-
li ations regarding wages for full lime 
researchers, called staff research associates 
(S RA ). According to UfYfE, current proposa ls 
by the University of California would give 
employees a 2 percent increase in pay. 
However, an increase of 4 percent is being 
demanded by the union. 

SRAs assist faculty in addition to teaching 
research techniques to graduate and post-doc-
torate students. 

According to UfYfE's stati stics, workers 
employed in the samc fie ld in the private sec-
tor earn 20 percent more I han workers al the 
Uni ve rsi lY of California . 

Carolan Buckmaster, a SRA at the UCS D 
Cancer Center and UPTE local president, said 
the University of Califomia is consideri ng 
changing the status of employees from career 
to casual I to 3 year positions. 

Buckmaster said that thi s change of status 
would free the University of Califomia from 
obligation to provide benefits such as heahh 
care and rcti remen!. 

Buckmaster also said that employees could 
be laid off with as lillie as one day 's notice; 
these proposals undercul Dynes' desire for 
UCSD 10 be a top-level research institution. 

"These sorts of proposals and imposi tions 
that are being made right now afrects the 
quality of research of the university and 
[Dynes] wants us to be the university of the 
year 2000," Buckmaster said. "So do we, but 
we feel that the quality of research is endan-

gered with researchers leaving at thc rale of 
30 percent because of Ihe proposals Ihat have 
been made and are being made." 

Buckmaster said Ihat Dynes and the uni-
versi ty need 10 understand the gravity of the 
si tualion. 

"The chancellor and the universilY are 
shooting itself in the foot and we want 10 
make sure they realize this," she said . 

Dynes was out of lown nnd unavailable for 
comment during the protest. 

Rogers Davis, assistant vice-chancellor of 
Human Resources, spoke on Dynes ' behalf 
and said the protest is unlikely to lead to any 
immediale results. 

"It 's importanl to und!!rstand that the col-
lective bargaining process is hilateral process 
and the fact that the protest occurs docs not 
change that at all ," Davis said. 

Jerger Kalmjin. an SRA in neurosciences 
and state president of UfYfE, said that high 
lumover rates arc detrimental 10 the quality of 
research at Ihe UniversilY of Ca lifornia. 

"We want this to be people's rea l jobs -
we want thi s to be a place where good people 
stay so that the research we ' re doing can real-
ly prolit from quality people." Kalmj in said. 
"But that 's going 10 take some investment." 

With respect to current SRA discontent 
regarding wages, Kalmijn said that the un i-
versity is misappropriating its funds. 

"The university has the money but they'd 
rather spend it on cham:ellor's raises and 
other overhead projects than putting it where 
it belongs - in Ihe staff," he ·aid. 

Davis said that since the bargaining process 
involves the consent of both parties, an agree-
ment cannot be established if UfYfE does not 
agree to the provisions recommended. 

"Management is not empowered to do 
anything unilaterally that would amount to 
change condition of employment ," Davis 
said.

Lenny KraV1l1. h a~ a ncw look: the 
dreds are gonc and a pro mising "fro is 
beginn ing to grow. At the concert in 
UCSO's RIM AC on Fri ., Sept. 18, 
Kravitz's muscles looked biggcr and 
hi s shirt was even tig hter than usual. 
He started otT the set wilh one of his 
new songs, using a new style. Yel 
somehow, some things never change. 

Kravitz is still thc King of Love. 
He is not only a musician, but also a 
messenger of both fcc l-good Inusil: 
and posi ti ve vibcs. By thc end of hi s 
performance every person in Ihe audi-
ence was danci ng and fecling swccl 
tingles of brotherly lovc. I was so 
moved by Krav it z's intermiss ion 
speech/preach on the importance of 
positiv ity that I hugged a random fan 
standing nex l to me - he didn 't run 
away. 

This rCl:cnltour promotes Krav itl' 
new album, 5, which he rc l ca~cd in 

early Scptcmber. The albu m took a 
total of cight months 10 I:ompictc 
because he had to learn how to digi-
tally record. All of Krav itz's prcvious 
records relied on morc basic record -
ing tCl: hniques. 

"No lape thi s lime," Krav itz said. 
"And 'digilal ' used to be a dirty word 
fo r me. But by wo rking inslrument by 
instrument , building up the sound, I 
was able 10 conslruct thc record like a 
puzz lc. I was listening to a lot of New 
York hip-hop. I likc Ihat tcchniquc -
the sparseness, the groove, the 
rhythm." 

Thc new album has a diffcn.:nt 
sound than Kravilz's prcvious work. 
Such l!hanges arc cvidence to the 
arti st's recent musical ex ploration. 
While some of the songs do sound 
over-produced whcn compared to 
Kravitz's previous anti-Icl!hnology 
Icchn iques , there arc a few jc~cl s in 

growth and cxperimentation. 
"Black Velveteen," a song about 

cloning and finding a virtual mate, 
stands OUI as Kravitz's most daring 
departure from his old style. "Think-
ing of You" is a melodic tributc to hi s 
mother and "Lillie Girl 's Eyes" was 
the gift he gavc his daughter for her 
ninlh birthday. "You ' re My Flavor" 
and "II's Your Life" renect Kravilz 's 
thoughts on interracial couples. 

"That 's where I cO me from," 
Kravitz said . "Even these days, 
therc's sometimes a stigma about it. 
And I was saying to two people in 
love, 'Don't worry about the world. 
Be yoursc lves. '" 

Kravitz grew up half-Bahamian, 
half-Jewish in Manhallan and Brook-
lyn. Son of actress Roxie Rooker 
(Helcn on "Jefferson's") and TV pro-

event, which exhibits choreogra-
phy from Switzerland, Mexico and 
the United States. The production 
features many U.S. premiers, and 
will not continue after its stay at 
Sushi. This across-the-waters artis-
tic collaboration is a once in a life-
time experience. 

"The interesting part about the 
performance is that each of these 
artists are coming from different 
backgrounds," Rim;on said. 
" witzerland is very cold and has 
mountains - and their work tends 
to be very intellet:tual. The wealher 
cause them to go out less and 
therefore they internalize more. 
Marco Antonio Silva's piece, on 
the other hand. is very passionate, 
very symbolic and very I.!motional. 
It dea ls with the civil war that 's 
happening down in Chiapas. The 

In general, Amerit:an modern 
dance pieces tend to be shorter in 
length than their European counter-
parts. American performances usu-
ally consist of a series of dances 
about 20 minutes in length, each 
with a different theme or emotion. 
One of the Swiss pieces in Kultur 
Mix II runs 40 minutes. 

" In Europe they tend to do an 
evening of work - an evening solo 
or an evening duet. They usually 
have one piece where they take 
their time and develop it. With this 
process the audience has to go 
through all of it, experiencing a 
range of emotions on the way," 
Rincon said. 

Don 't be daunted by the idea of 
a night of high art . This production 
is beginner-safe; it strives to keep 
its viewers from being out in the 

conceptual cold . The program-
packet handed out before the show 
includes a small synopsis of each 
dance and the story or concept 
behind the choreography. This 
information is helpful because 
modem dance tends to be more 
abstract than other form s of enter-
tainment. 

"If the ~tory is easy, the audi-
ence doesn' t have to participate 
much . Boy meets girl - there it 
is," Rint:on says. "I think you have 
to reach higher when you come 
into a contemporary show. You can 
form your own decisions - your 
likes and di slikes." 

Sushi is definitely the home of 
this type of intelligent yet visceral 
entertai nment. Every season 
encompa ses a wide variety of eth-
nically. t: ulturally, sex ually and 
personally influenced perfor-
mances. Each year offers amazing 
evenings of dance, music , poetry, 
props, confessions ... every thing. 

Vicki Wolf, the Executive 
Director of Sushi , calls it, "the 
home of the brave. insane and truly 
remarkable." 

Pat Rincon agrees. 
"I think that Sushi is the most 

progressive, provocative, thought-
provoking, fabulous, necessary 
component of San Diego," she says 
with a smile. "Vicki Wolf is a trail -
blazing hot chick, and she's doing a 
very important job."

ROBIN'S DREAMS UNREALIZED 
This fall s fantasy of life and death falls short 

Courtesy of Polygram Films 
After Ufe: Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorr~ (Chris and Annie Nelson ) meet each other beyond 
the white light and discuss the complications of love and death. 

By Chris Edgett 
Guardian Reporter 

For tiny remJers who experience 
emotion simply by watching some-
one else laugh or cry, read no fur-
ther. Instead, go to your local the-
ater and see ·'What Dreams May 
Come." This latest special-effects 
spectacular, designed to tug the 
heartstrings, is in theaters now. 
Unfortunately, the movie lacks the 
dreamlike quality the name sug-
gests. 

Viewers follow Rohin 
Williams' character, Chris Nielsen, 
on his journey into the afterl i fe. 
Nielsen has little desire in life or 
death beyond his beloved Annie 
(Annabella Sciorra). Annie's good 
side-had side wnflkt comprises 
the film' s only shred of plot ; 
indeed, all the characters seem to 
revel in duality in order to escape 
dimension or depth . 

The advantage to the thin story 
line is that it giws the <ludience 
plenty of time for se lf-refl ecti on. 
But making <I film ahout love, 
death, heaven and hell that pro· 

vokes self-rellccti on is as easy as 
making a sad Ii 1m about the Holo-
caust. To its credit "What Dreams 
May Come" managed to be about 
as thought provoking as 
"Shindler's List" was sad, even if 
the thoughts provoked had lillie to 

do with the lilm or its two-dimen-
sional characters . 

The special effects are the most 
impressive element of the film; 
e,xtensive computer graphics 
merge seamlessly with a massive 
set to gener<lte the effect of a 
majesti c, intangihle world. Heaven 
is envisioned by Williams' charac-
ter as <I painted acid trip. Flow and 
movement are incorporated with 
all the glorious waterfalls, lakes 
<lnd mountains th<lt one might 
expec t in such a place. The i lIu -
sie)J1s arc perfect ill most cases, as 
animators co mbine fantasy with 

reality. 
The movie's version of hell IS 

more imposing and more pre-
dictable. A simple amalgamation of 
traditional hellish themes, hell con-
tains plenty of tormented suuls ren-
dered in wicked computer-
enhanced color. The resulting 
glossy sheen on the film is evi-
dence of director Vincent Ward's 
effort to distancc the audience 
from the movie. It is this perfect 
surface that makes the lilm so 
emotionally impenctrahlc. 

Manipulation permeates the 
film, as the writers and the actors 
try very hard to bring the audience 
along a magical journey. They tell 
you when to be sad and somber by 
weeping for you. They try to impart 
elation by giggling at the camera or 
jumping from cliffs, and they toss 
in token clever lines to relieve the 
vast tensions of the plol. 

It is a Ii 1m that babies yo u. 
cradling you in a fuzzy embrace 
that will ei ther make you sigh in 
emotional fulfillment or struggle to 
escape it's stifling grasp

Rumba baby Rumba! 

-**** 
If you are in the mood for dance 

music with a blend of Spanish 
lyrics, conga drums. piano. clar-
inet . trombones, cowbells. tim-
bales. saxophones and horns, this is 
(he album for you . BioRitma"s 
Rumba Baby RUlllba just might 
make you wish you had taken those 
Latin Dance classes. 

Picture this - ladies wearing 
elbow length gloves and gents in 
their zoot suits. all in a classy club. 
dancing the rumba. Odds are that 
when you listen to the first track., 
you will imagine this scene. Thc 
first song's piano chords and scales 
sound as if they ' re telling a story, 
while the horns have an authorita-
tive quality. 

The album alternates between 
Spanish and English lyrics. The 
song ··Ugly" is as ridiculous as it is 
cute. Ugly, I/gly - All rhe ladie.l· 
lhink /'111 uglyl Ugly, ugly - Even 
after drink.I· l'm IIgll'. 

This album will make every 
evening a rumba dancl! part y.

The San Francisco-based quartet 

Crumb is one of the few modern 
rock bands to successfully integrate 
the violin into its malerial. While 
Crumb's lales t release >.I·ec-
ol1ds>mil1l1res>"ours> tcnds to be 
straightforward and hard rocking, 
songs such as "Do You Rcmember" 
highlight the band's ability to incor-
porate more sensitive undertones. 

The album features a relatively 
standard combination of guitar. 
bass and percuss ion. as well as the 
pleasing addition of the violin on 
several tunes . 

The big picture: >s~C(}nds>lIIil1 -

pop/alternative amalgamation. 
Unfortunately, it fail s to stand out 
as exceptional in any single 
respect. While Crumb's sound may 
get the li stener to tap hi s or her foot 
along to the beat, thi · album falls 
short of inspirational. It is, 
nonetheless, a pleasant sounding 
album that proves honest pop-rock

-
**** 

The fourth release by <:racker, 
Gentlemen 's Blues, represents a 
unique effort to blend loud with 
quiet, and weird with normal. 
Crader pull s through in this 
attempt with a very supportive 
band of guitars . percussion, key · 
boards and vocals. 

Songs such as "Star" and the 
titl e track. "Gentleman's Blues," 
represent the group's vast musical 
abi Iity to combine great lyrics with 
harmonics that are both simple and 
unpredictable. 

However. Cracker's style is not 
terribly unique inside their genre of 
music. Many songs follow a stan-
dard recipe for music: Verse, c1lO-
rus, verse, chorus, chorus without 
strong instrument act:Oll1paniment. 
chorus, end. The beller songs on 
the album, such as "James River," 
arc the products of Cracker taking 
stylistic risks. These chances pay · 
off. Listening to the album a few 
times will make a fan out of any li s-
tener.

Chemical Brother. 
Brother's Gonna Work It Out 

A.tr .. w..u/c_ .... 

-****, 
After selling 700,000 copies of 
~ig Your Own Hole in the United 
States and winning a Grammy for 
Best Rock Instrumental , The 

hemical Brothers have introduced 
their newest mix: Bror!wr :v COllllU 
Work It 0111. True to form , their 
album carries the same intense 
energy found in Dig Your Own 

Ho/~. while the continuous mix dis-
plays the technical prowess they 
have gained after eight years on the 
turntables. 

The Chemical Brothers incorpo-
rated their familiar block-rockin 
beat with the strong hints of '70s 
soul and funk that we have come to 
expect from them and other UK 
artists. The splatter of horns and 
spoken word give a lighter and 
more playful Ilavor to the rapid 
breakbeats and heavy bass. Not to 
worry technophilcs, this D still 
retains a heft y dose of pure elec-
tronic tunes that don't shy away 
from their underground roots. The 
Micronauts mix of "Block Rockin 
Beats" is one track not to miss if 

HIATU 25 

you're looking for some dassic 
break beat. Freesty le'S ;<Oon' t Stop 
the Rock" takes you back. to an old-
school Detroit synthesized techno 
sound. 

What makes Brother's COliI/O 
Work II Out a worthy 0 to li sten 
to, though , isn' t the individual 
merit of the tracks, but the /low of 
the entire album. Although there 
are moments of stagnancy within 
some tracks. the plethora of cli -
maxes and the constant flow of 
absorbing beats kcep your adrena-
line and serotonin levels on a con-
stant high. 

Each track in Brother S Conna 
Work II Out can be enjoyed on its 
own. This is one album, however, 
that i-s meant to be listened to from 
beginning to end in order to best 
appreciate the mix masters at work. 
After eight years of mixing and 
molding the breakbeat scene, The 
Chemical Brothers are one of the 
premier groups introducing this 
vanguard form as legitimate music 
instead of just a video game sound-
track.

KRAVITZ: 
Lenny wants to 
Let Lo've RuLe 
ContInued from ..... 21 
ducer Sy Kravitz, Lenny Kravitz 
was destined for the spotlight from 
the stan. Music was an important 
factor in his upbringing - especial-
ly the jazz and R&B in New York 
City. Upon moving to L.A., he sang 
with the Califo rnia Boys C hoir and 
recorded with Zubin Mehta. 

Kravi tz tirst hit 'the big time 
with LeI Love Rule, and followed 

this release with Mallu} Said in 
1991 , Are YOII Gonna Go My Way 
in 1993, and Circus in 1995. 
Kravitz also performed with the 
H.O.R.D.E. tour two years ago. He 
says that he views this break from 
his recording and performance 
career as a blessing. 

"Even though I've been making 
records professionally for nine 
years, this time I'm making music 
again as if it's my lirst album," 
Kravitz sa id. "No preconceptions. 
No expectations. I'rn j ust flowing , 
and it's a blessing." 

Lenny Kravitz' concert on Fri-

The UCSO Guardian 

day didn ' t stan off on the best note. 
There was an hour and twenty 
minute wait after the opening band, 
Ozomatli , and the waiting crowd 
eventually began to boo the empty 
stage. Kravitz was feeling under 
the weather that night and so began 
the show with some tediously long 
jam sessions to allow himself to 
warm up. Many new songs were 
played during the lirst half 01 the 
show that the audience wasn ' t 
familiar with. 

The second half of the concert, 
however, took the cake. Usi ng the 
title track from his lirst album to 

raise the energy, Kravitz had every-
one from the audience repeatedly 
chant the choru s, "Let love ruuuu- . 
ule. You 've got to let love rule." As 
this hum from the crowd continued,

audience. 

At first everyone swarmed 
toward him, dying to touch a real, 
live rock star. Eventually, however, 
people realized that he needed 
space and gave him room to walk. 
Kra vitz then proceeded to make hi s 
way through the crowd, shaking 
hands and giving high-fives, across 
the floor. up to the top of the

The spotlight followed him 

through the gy m, as his band con-
tinued the tune on stage. It is not 
often that a celebri ty will walk 
shining among the masses, much 
less jump olT a concert stage into a 
pit full of kids. It is not often that a 
pit full of kids will chant "Let love 
rule" while swaying back and forth 
at a rock concert - at least not in 
thi s generation. 

Perhaps our generation can be 
made to smi le, dance like children. 
and hug one another - with a little 
help from a rock star.

Why do that? Because when that

when one of the Tritons 'pike '

that 's a joh well done.

cheering them on . UCSO took 
the third game and the crowd got

For all of you loyal readers, 
this is usuall y the part when I tell 
you that drinking a milk carton 
full of bathtuh gin could do noth-
ing hut enhance your perfor-
mance in the stands. Last year, I 
might ha ve sa id that, but ovcr the 
summer I had a change of heart. 
No longe r do I suhsc rihe to that 
theory .. . 

You sec. if we all went out to 
games, we could all have that 
much fun . As of now. there arc 
people coming out to games, and 
hel ieve me, we hit ve one hell of a 
time. I wouldn ' t mi ss those 
ga illes for the world. At the very

Hey, even if you sit around

long like I do. you still nl!ed those 
kind of breaks.

Continued from page 36 
shelled out $XO. and thanked the 
dri ve r fo r the ride. 

It was midday and the surf at 
Jat:o Beat: h looked good . The two 
dedded 10 surf first and find a 
pla t:e to stay later. (After all. they 
were in Costa Ri <..:'1. and "winging 
it" is the way to trave l, a<..:cord ing 
to Dederi ck .) Ho~ev.:r. wh en 
they pulled out thei r hoards fro m 
the bags, Brooks ' hoard was hro· 
ken . 

,.! didn't think anything hap· 
pened to the boards when they new 
olT thc t:ar." Brooks said. "We 
pa<..:ked the boards reall y well. hut I 
guess the fall snapped o lT the 
nose. " 

With their hoards were out of 
commission. they dedded to 
explore Jat:o in stead. Jaco, as 
Brooks described it. is a "one-road 
town about two miles long. It 's on 
the verge of ocing developed . hut 
was still low-key with only a few 
restaurants and touristy shops." 

In cruising around the town. the 
two stumbled across an ex-patriot 
surfer from Florida who said he 
would lix their boards in a day. 

When Brooks and Dederick gOI 
their boards back, the surf al Jaw 
beat:h, unfortunate ly, wasn ' t <..:oop· 
erating. With ten-foot tides and 
heavy currents, the surf at Jaw 
bea<..:h was "lick Ie" at best. 

So, the two decided to head 
south, to Quepos. 

A I wo·hour bu s ride 1,lIer. 
Brooks and Dederick were at the 
cntran <..:c of Parque Na<..:ional 

Manuel Antonio. ab ut 15 minutc~ 
outside Quepos. 

Manuel Antoni o was " Iikl: 
being on your own tropical island," 
Brooks said. " It was like what 
YOll 'd imagine if you had heen 
shipwret: ked - with no one ebe 
arollnd ." 

Surfwise. the two got "skunked 
again." but the poor surf conditions 
didn 't keep them dow n. In~ t ead of 
surling. the two spent their time 
hiking around Manuel Antonio 
ex ploring the vast and lIncrowded 
wuslline lined wi th palm tree~ llOd 
hacked hy Costa Rica 's tropical 

mountain~. 
After a couple days. Brooks and 

Dedl!rick decided to head back 
north . For $2 cach, they hopped un 
a bus that took them back to Jat:o 
Beat:h. Thi ~ time they got beller 
surf. 

After another t:ouple nights in 
the mellow heat:h town of Jat:o. 
Brooks and Dede ri t:k got on anoth · 
er hus that took them six hours 
northwest up winding hairpin dirt 
roads into the Costa Ri<..:an moun· 
tains. 

They di sembarked at Monte 
Verde, very mut:h relieved to be oil 
the wild hus. 

'The bus . ride was really 
gnarly," Brooks said. " I don' t think 
thc hus had any suspension. We 
humped and swayed the entire way. 
The driwr took the turns way too 
fast. Plus, I had given up my seattu 
an older lady with her grand<..:hild 
and had to stand the entire way. We 
were very happy to get off." 

Monte Verde is a cheese·mak-
ing w mmunity founded by 
American Quakers. It is in a rain 
forest. hut unlike the lower. lyi ng 
areas of Costa Rican rain forest, it

is not a tropi t:al area . MOllie Verde 
is <..:ooler, not as humid and sur· 
rounded by groves of pine tr.:es. 

In the laid -hack com munity, 
Brooks and Dederick entertained 
themselves with long hikes. horse· 
hat:k rides and ex ploring the sus-
pension bridges, called "sky-
walks," that hung in the <..:anopy 
ahove the forest Iloor. 

"I really liked the mellow alli· 
tudes of the people of Monte 
Verde." Brooks said . "They were a 
very receptive, welcoming and giv-
ing people." 

From Monte Verde, Brooks and 
Dederi t:k, tonk a hus hack down to 
the Pat:i li t: Coast. Instead of helld· 
ing hack down to Jaco, the two got 

a ride straight west to the lishing 
conllllunity of Tamarindo where 
they hoped to lind some heller surf. 

Tamarindo was more developed 
than Monte Verde. There were 
hotel s and restaurants, btH "you 
still felt separated from the main-
land," Brooks said. 

The surf in Tamarindo was kind 
of fun, hut again. "super fi<..:kle, " so 
the two decided to walk to Playa 
Grande and Playa Langosta. Under 
di vergenl tides, the surf "wasn't 
epit:." but there were still some 
good waves. 

The next day, the swell had 
picked uP. and Brooks and 
Dederick dec ided to slirf Playa 
Hermosa. It was higger th an 

expected. 
"We got barred from Playa 

Hermosa." Brooks said. "We tried 
to paddle out, but it was too big. 
The scts were coming in too fast 
and we <..:ouldn ' t get past the inside. 
A couple guys made it out bel ween 
sets, but just got dri lied.' h was 
bowling hard." 

After a few more nights in 
Tamarindo. Brooks and Dederkk 
caught a six-hour bus ride bal:k 
into San Jose and caught a J1ight 
back to the United States. 

Taking the bus around Costa 
Rica was an adventure. hut deli · 
nitely the way to go, a<..:cording to 
Dederick.

Fluke Goal Puts Tritons in the Doghouse 
LUCKY SHOT: )n a competitive match, University of Redlands Bulldogs beat Tritons on a botched cross-turned-goal 
By Travis Hili

For whatever reasons, the 
UCSD men 's soccer team has not

utive wi ns since the first two 
matches of the season. This Jek yll-
and-Hyde trend continued last 
night when the Tritons tra ve led to 
Redlands and lost, 1-0, on a fluke 
fr.:e kick from freshman Bulldog 
midfielder Andy O'Shay. 

UCSD, ranked 5th in the 
Western Region, came into the 
Redlands contest with considcrablc 
momentum. In Redlands, however, 
the Bulldogs took the wind out of 
the Tritons' sa ils. 

The Bulldogs, the underdogs in 
this con test, werc lired up for thei r 
chance to take down the Tritons. 
Redlands played aggressi vc soccer 
early on, but the Tritons easi ly 
weathered the storm. But in the 
36th minute. it happened. 

Fifth-year senior defender John 
Brandon committed a foul and the 
Bulldogs received a free kick just 
outside the I IS-yard box. 0' Shay 
lined up to take the kick and the 
Bulldogs set thei r play to be a cross 
into the box.

anticipation of the cross. Instead of 
pUlling the ball into the 18-yard 
box, O'Shay he miss-hit it. The 
miss-hit turned out to be a blessi ng 
in disguise for the Bulldogs. The 
ball confused urtolo, and it tipped 
off of hi s gloves into the net for a 
goal. It W<lS not prelly but the 
Bulldogs were on top, 1-0. 

urlolo, who has been sparkling 
for thc Tritons all season long, took 
hi s first mistake of the season 
rather hard. 

"There's no way around it," 
CUrlolo said. " It ' was one of the 

wor~ t mi stakes I've ever made ." 
Nevertheless, the Tritons 

entercd halftime with confidence. 

"Everybody thought the same 
thing at halftime," Curtolo said. 
"' We thought their goa l was a fluke 
and we'd go out and score five or 
six on these guys."

Another Tough Loss Teaches UCSD a Lesson 
EXPERIENCE: After losing 2-1 to N AlA power Azu a Pacific, Tritons gain valuable insights for the remainder of the season 
By Jacob Gordon 
Sports Editor 

There is onl y one thing tougher 
than winning a championship. 
Winning it again the next 
year. And the next year. 
And the next year after 
that. When you 
are the defending 
champions, 
everyone is gun-
ning for you. You never 
get an easy game because 
every single team wants to be the 
one to dethrone the champs . 

senior standing. 
Although UC D is a young 

team, it has sti ll been saddled with 
high expectations to keep on win-

ning. For the Tritons, anything 
less that another National 

Championship would not 
necessari ly con-
. stitute a disap-
pointing sea on, 
but it would, at 

the very least, be surpris-
ing. While last year's team 

could simply will itself to win 
tough games, thi s year 's young 
Tritons have been severely tested 
by somc of the tougher teams. 

player in the head and dropped on 
to (he foot of Payne, who poked it 
in as UCSD defenders stood hclp-
less nearby. 

The prospect of being behind 
fru trated the Tritons as they head-
ed to the locker room during half 
time. They ca rne out in the sewnd 
half tired up and ready to play . 

Less than 10 minutes later, they 
got their equali zer. Hurley headed 
up the sideline, cut back and 
threaded the I,eedl.: to fre hman 
Jes 'ica Cordova, who hla~ted it 
into the net. 

Such was the case last Monday 
when the Tritons tnweled north to 
play NAJA powerhouse Azusa 
Pacific. Games like this leave lillie 
room for erro r, and UCSD's 
momentary defensive lapses led to 
a 2-1 loss. 

UCSD women's soccer team 
has always defied the odds and 
made a habit of winning the 
National Championship, remini '-
cent of the Chicago Bulls' domina-
tion of the NBA. 

When the Tritons tra ve led north , 
Azusa was 7-0 and had AII -
Ameril:an Kendra Pay ne back in 
the lineup for the first time since 
she suffered an ankle injury last 
month. With UCSD's record at 4- 1-
I going in, the Tritons knew they 
were going to be tested. 

The wmbi nat ion of seasoned 
veteran 10 young newcomer was 
prclty to watch , yet UCSD would 
not be able to take advantage again. 
After the goa l, the young tcam 
secmingly lost the aggressiveness 
and intensity it had brought out 
after halftimc.

Battle: UCSD midfielder Angie Mann gets down and dirty as she 
tries to get the Tritons the equalizer they desperately need . 

The Tritons are also similar to 
the Bulls, who will like ly lose 
Michael Jordan. Scottie Pippen and 
Phil Jackson for nex t season, 
bel:ause they entered this season 
without many key players from 
their championship three-peat. 
While last year's team was loaded 
with nine seniors, this yea r's squad 
only has two players , Allison 
Hurley and Shelbi Thiele, with 

The Cougars had 10 t to the 
Tritons in nine meetings and they 
wanted a piece of the three-time 
champs. In a hard fought battle, the 
Tritons let in two soft goals despite 
the fact that they controlled most of 
the action. 

Azusa lirst got on the board 
with a fluke goa l in the 43rd 
minute. A Cougar player launched 
a corner ki ck into the box where 
Triton goalkeeper Jennifer Hetland 
punched it away. Instead of dear-
ing, though, the ball hit an Azusa 

In the 63 rd minute, Paync 
scored again and UCSD would not 
recover, try as they mi ght. 

"The worst thing ahollt the loss 
is we know we could have beat that 
tea m," sophomore midficlder 
Angie Mann said. 

Hurley echoed thc same senti -
ments. 

"We had ollr chances," Hurley 
said. "We just couldn 't put our 
shots away. It wasn't like we were 
kicking their ass or they werc ki ck-
ing ours. We just had a bad few 
minutes and they capita li zed." 

Coming back from behind is 

<II ways tough and UCSD has had to 
play with a delicit this year more 
often than in previous years. Against 
Azusa, although UCSD responded 
well the lirst t imc they C041d not 
muster a second equalizer. 

This loss is not the end of the 
seasun fur the Tritons. The game 
was a le<lrning experience for the 
team and hopefully will let them 
sec what needs to be worked on. 
Com;h Brian McManus said that 
tough games like this in the regu-
I<lr season can greatl y enhance 
their play later on in the postsea-
son.

Back~: 

"That 's why we don ' t schedule 
that m<lny Division III games," 
McManus said . "We schedule just 
enough so we can get into region-
als . [We like to play] NAJA, 
Division I and Division U schpols 
and try to get a hard prograln in and, 
play some good games." 

Though the loss drops the 
Tritons to 4-2- 1 on the year, UCSD 
is better prepared to compete 
bec<luse they played tougher com-
petition. This game just brought 
them one step closer to realizing 
their gO<l1 of an unprecedented 
fourth straight championship.

SKINNING: Despite heckling fans in a ho tile arena UCSD beat up on La Verne 15-2, 15-7, 15-6 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

If there is just one truism in c.:o l-
lege-sports, it is this; It is always nice 
to go into a division rival's home 
court and just BEAT THE LIVING 
TAR UT OF THEM! That's what 
the UCSD women 's volleyball team 
did last night to the La Verne 
Leopards, 15-2, 15-7, 15-6. 

sually th Leopard are 
UC D's chief competition in the 
We t Region, but if thi wa the 
toughestte t, than U SO i in good 

shape. Last year on their way to the 
National Championship, the 
Tritons defeated La Verne 17-
15, 6-15, 15-7, 15-8. This 
year. it was a 
clean sweep. 

Outside 
Hiller Leslie 
Punelli led the Tritons with 
10 kills while her partner ' in crime, 
junior Alii on Bender and 'enior 
Kathleen Brynje tad, weren't far 
behind, both pUlling away nine kills. 

The 'e big three weren't done, 

though, with Punelli also scoring 6 
digs and Brynjestad and Bender 

having and 4 services aces 
respectively. All in all 

D had 51 
kills and held 
La Verne to 
just 29. 

Christine Kueneman had 
25 assists to the big hillers, while 
Shannon Noonan led the learn in 
kill percentage, converting 6 of 8 
c.:hance for a .750 clip. Defensive 
specialist Jaime Hackleman and 

freshman sensation Kathleen Hentz 
added suppon in the dominating 
performance. 

This trip to La Verne is just a 
start for the Tritons who have three 
upcoming games in a five-day 
stretch. Next up is another division 
rival, Chapman University, here at 
RIMAC Arena on Friday at 7 p.m. 
If UCSD play ' anything like it did

spectacular. 

Come out, show your chool 
spirit and cheer for the champ.
