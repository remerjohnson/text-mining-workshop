'No Confidence' Voted 231-116 
Despite McElroy's Penitence 

Chancellor WIlliam McElroy 

AS Resists June Ballot 

Another Vote Ahead; 
Saltman Asked Back 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

The Academic Senate 
approved 231-116 last night a 
resolution of "no confidence" in 
Chancellor William McElroy 
despite an appearance by the 
Chancellor in which he backed 
down from all the positions 
which precipitated the current 
administrative crisis. 

Another resolution, passed 
with only a handful of 
dissenting votes, "strongly 
urges" Paul Saltman to return 
as Academic Affairs Vice 
Chancellor, the position from 
which he resigned last week. 

- . The Senate will take a vote by 
mail over the next two weeks 
which takes precedence over 
yesterday' vote, but the mail 
count is not expected to 
significantly alter the Senate's 
position. 

The resolution, approved by 
one of the be t attended Senate 
meetings in its history, carries 
no official weight with the 
university, but it is thought by 
most admini trators and 
faculty members that a no 
confidence vote by the whole 
faculty, the first time that has 
ever happened in UC history , 
will cause UC President David 
Saxon to ask for McElroy's 
resignation. 

In a statement released 
a few minutes after the vote, 
Saxon expressed " regret that 
those present.. . voted a lack of 
confidence in Chancellor 
McElroy 's leadership. 

"However, there'll be a mail 
ballot in the next few days. As I 
said last week, it is clear to me 
that this is not the time for 
precipitous action. Instead, it is 
time for thoughtful analysis

Saxon. 

McElroy addressed the 
Septate at the beginning of the 

was dependent on the 
circumstances under which the 
job was offered.) 

McElroy also recanted his 
intention to move the dean of 
graduate studies and research 
away from the jurisdiction of 
the vice chancellor, telling the 
Senate that he wanted a 
committee of faculty, students 
and staff to study such a 
change, but that in the 
meantime, the office would 
revert to reporting to the vice 
chancellor. 

" I have erred in disregarding 
the pleas of responsible and 
earnest faculty to withhold 
action pending a full review by 
an appropriate faculty body, " 
McElroy said.

Despite continued objections 
from the Associated Students 
Council, students will be asked 
to vote on funding for a 
proposed r.ecreation facilities 
project. in a referendum June 6 
and 7. 

Although the Graduate 
Student Council Thursday 
reiterated its suoport for 
conductio. the referendum and 
privately answered several 
questions raised by the 
undergraduates, AS President 
Carlos Montalvo said Tuesday 

his group will not change its no-
referendum stance until "we 
have all those answers in 
writing." 

Montalvo said Mike Elcan, 
GSC ree facilities representa-
tive, had met with several AS 
leaders Thursday night and 
"pretty much answered all our 
questions, but we haven't seen 
anything in writing ... 

Elcan said the AS had not 
earlier notified anyone 
involved that the referendum 
would be discussed at last 
week's meetJng. The under-
graduate council at the meetlq 

unanimously called for 
postponement of the refer-
endum until next fall. 

The referendum would ask 
students to approve a $5 per 
quarter fee to fund a proposed 
$1,006,000 recreation facility 
construction. 

It will consist of a swimming 
pool with Jacuzzi, raquetball 
courts, night lighting on the 
Muir Field and a jacuzzi at the 
Natatorium. 

The call for postponement 
cited concern that there had 
been little publicity, election 

(Please , ..... to pa.e IJ) 

would have allowed (him) to 
have been more sensitive to its 
concerns and desires." 

He offered to: let the 
chairman of the Senate, 
currently Chemistry Profess,,\" 
Russell Doolittle, sit in on the 
thrice weekly Vice Chancellor 
meeting; to start meeting 
regularly with department 
chairmen, and to reinstate Paul 
Saltman as vice chancellor of 
academic affairs.

and after the meeting, said he 
would have to "think over"

Letters to the Editor 

Third Needs N arne 
To Reverse Slide 
Students of "Tbird": 

It II beyond me to gather an 
understanding of our attempts 
to name "Third." We have 
voted in an attempt to do so for 
the past four years Isince my 
arrival to UCSD) and a year or 
two before my coming. These 
actions compile to. five to six 
years of effort - if not seven to 
eight years - for a college not 
much older than the years of 
effort; "Third" was approved 
by the Regents in January of 
1970 (the college, not the name) 
nine years ago. 

I am aware that we need a 
name which focuses on the very 
heart of our being. Yet, in doing 
the search we have jeapardized 
our academic and social 
awareness to ourselves , to 
VCSD and, more important, to 
the community which we intend 
to serve. We have ventured 
from our path and quest for 
academic and social stability 
(or people of mlor in order to 
satisfy our want of a "universal 
name." 

People ralUed for Lumumba-
Zapata College, but it was 
extremely doubtful if such a 
college would receive the 
needed financial support (rom 

We're So 
Lucky ... 

Editor: 
Gee whiz, lucky us! We 

actually get to vote on the name 
for our own school! Provost 
Watson , your generosity 
bubbles out with every word! I 
really think it's super of the 
administration to let us 
students select a name. Some 
people were just born under a 
lucky star! 

I only wish we were lucky 
enough to select our own name, 
not one that the administration 
feels is appropriate. I suppose, 
however, IIOmething Uke that 
wouldn't take luck, but actual 
student rights .... 

Mark S. Eseajeda 

the Regents or VCSD, who 
could not identify with such a 
name, We voted down Martin 
Luther King Jr. as the name for 
our college . I believe the reason 
is due to his being black, even 
though his efforts in life 
characterized the very heart 
and soul of " Third." As a result, 
we are left with Third College 
again. The Naming Committee 
with respect to colleges has 
shown disfavor with this name, 
yet we continue to push this 
name. We figbt. 

We fight ever downward. We 
fight at the cost of: a) class 
structure and direction, b) 
professor quality and retention, 
and c) student retention , 
student ethnic makeup, and 
social stability on "Third." We 
are no longer fighting for a 
name but practicing an 
obsession. We have fallen prey 
to a ritualistic meaningless 
action, serving and aiding no 
one. 

I do not believe in surrender, 
however, I do believe that the 
best general knows when to 
retreat in order to attack. We 
need foresake or simply choose 
a name that will pass in order to 
save the goals of the college. If 
we continue to practice our 
ritualism, we will foresake all, 
our very education and societal 
worth - the goals of our 
college. 

Whatever the college is 
named we should fight for the 
goals : Education in an 
academic and social sense, the 
social atmosphere reflecting 
the needs o( People of Color in 
order to promote student 
awareness, unders~nding and 
social worth. This is to begin at 
"Third" and gradually fill the 
campus in order that we as 
students may, in a more heart-
felt feeling, be educated. 
Provost Watson, WE are not 
lucky that WE have the chance 
to vote nor are WE asking for a 
chance, WE are demanding 
what is rightfully ours.

Chancellor Wins 

Nixon Award Bestowed 
Editor: 

Since the world's irreparable 
loss at the death of AdolfHiUer, 
a number of men and women 
have attempted to match that 
great man's dynamic leader-
ship style. On our own campus 
we have been privileged to 
witness one such man who, 
though his efforts have been 
relatively meagre, has 
nevertheless ruled with true 
power and authority . We have 
seen his confident commanding 
of our ship through the 
troublesome waters of a 

daycare center, vending 
machines , a coHee hut, and now 
- his greatest triumph - the 
Sattman issue. And all the while 
he has refused to be corrupted 
by listening to the frenzied 
voices of the masses, the 
babblings of democracy. He 
has had confidence in himself 
only, and therefore, my friends , 
we know that we can have 
confidence in bim. We know 
that he shall never be turned 
aside from the true path of 
power by others' concerns; we 
can always count on him to do 

what is in his own best 
interests. How, therefore , can 
anyone even consider giving 
him a vote of no-confidence, 
when he is such a confident 
man?! 

In recognition of superior 
leadership in the style of the 
great dictators of the world , we 
hereby of(jcially bestow upon 
him the consummate honor of 
being named the 1979 winner of 
the Richard Milhouse Nixon 
award . Long li~e our chan· 
cellor! 

UCSD Students for Facism 

Recreation Center Not Worthy 
Of 'Fll:nding; Other ' Goals First 

Editor: 
I would like to urge students 

to vote "NO" on the proposed 
new recreation center_ In the 
past, students have had a 
number of promises about 
future usage of facilities 
seriously compromised, e.g., 
the proposed conversion of the 
Coffee Hut, the "student-
affordable apartments" that 
were to be part of nearby 
development . Futhermore, 
given the reduced funding 
possible under Proposition 13, 
many areas of student life will 
need student funding. Given the 
proximity of the Pacific Ocean, 
it ' is hard to see why an 

participate in intramural 
activities) and announce that 
something must be done. 
Simply eliminating inner-tube 
water polo would take care of 
the crowding. Lest we are 
urged to shudder at the concept 
of eliminating anything. let us 
remember that we are already 
reducing library hours, and 
considering eliminating 

several entire academic 
programs due to budgeting 
restrictions. 'To continue to act 
as if UCSD is still planning to 
grow to twelve colleges after it 
has been decided to stop at four 
is expensive dreaming. If 
additional student money is 
taken, let it go to the highest 
priority,: housing .

• *aU "ri~ .. 
- It waj aILbeer, bikinis and 
Brolaski as UCD s ur fers 
finisbed one-two, and took third 
overall at the first annual 
Lowenbrau Spring Surfing 
Classic held at Black 's Beach 
last Saturday. 

Mark Brolaski saved his best 
for last as he ducked under a 
bursting lip in the final heat 
only to reappear seconds later 
for the tube ride of the contest 
and first place individual 
honor . 

Others were not so lucky. The 
waves ranged from two to four 
feet, often exploding in only one 
to two feet of water. More than 
once surfer and board were 
rudely pounded into the waiting 
sand by the nasty shorebreak. 

Second place finisher from 
UCSD, Geoff Biehl, was an 
early victim. In first round 
action his board dealt him a 
wicked whack on the head, sent 
courtesy of a thick shorebreak 
lip, causing blood to ooze from 
Biehl's scalp. That did not stop 
Biehl. He adva nced through the 
preliminaries and repeatedly 
rocketed 360s off the lip to the 
crowd 's amazement and the 
judges' approval. Bi e hl 
received three stitches after 
the contest. 

UCSD coordinator and 
co ntestant Bert Neilse n 
attributed the "super crunchy " 
conditions to a shallow sandbar 
that regularly forms at this 
time of year at Black's. 

UCSD finished with 33 .5 
points, right behind Sao Diego 
State (34.5) and team trophy 
winner Orange Coast College 
with 40 overall points. 

The team title was decided by 
eleve!! preliminary heats -

eight men's, twokneeboard and 
a women's heat. Five points 
were awarded first, four points 
to second and so on. 

In the men's division UCSD 
Surf Club president Alex Bravo 
added a tenth place fini h. Rich 

Mark Brolaski (center ) receives trophy from coach Berl Niel en

Glellves took third and Bruce 
Royer fourth in the kneeboard 
division . Denise Navarro 
placed third and Lorretta 
Neary fifth in the women's 
divisiori for UCSD. 

There were a few minor 
disappointments and major 
surprises for UCSD. 

-For the first time ever 
Gleaves failed to win a Black' 
Beach kneeboard competilion . 

-Neilsen, member of the 
National Scholastic Surfing 
As oeiation (NSSA) national 
team was knocked out in 
preliminaries. 

-Billy Stern , third place 
winner at last year's All 
American Huntington Beach 
contest , was only credited with 
riding two waves in his opening 
heat. Stern said he actually 
rode seven or eight waves 
commenting that his blue 
jersey over his blue wetsuit 
made it difficult for the judges 
to distinguish him from thenon-
contestant surfers in the water. 
He filed a protest bu t was 
unsuccessful , adding "that's 
the way contest go. There i a 
lot of luck in contests." 

-UC SD coac h Bolton 
Colburn was of( in J apan 
surfing on the IPS pro circuit, 
riding for Gordon and Smith 
surfboards . 

San Diego State was almost 
eliminated before they even 
had a chance to wet their feet. It 
was " high anxiety," according 
to entry fee table volunteer 

Eric Pinczower , a their entry 
fee funds did not show up until 
moments before the star t of the 
contest. 

Brolaski's repeated disap-
pearing act was not the only 
entertai nm e n t on h a nd 
Saturday. Lowenbrau helped 
sponsor theevent, providing six 
kegs of light and dark beer for 
the public. And " girls like 
UCSD has never seen before 
flooded Black ' Beach," 
according to surf team member 
and conte tant Eric Pinczower. 

Altogether about 75 students 
surfed from six different 
colleges , quite a change from . 
UCSD's first surfing contest 
held against USIU at Black's 
Beach in 1967. 

College surfing has grown 
si nce then and UCSD has 
a lways been near the top. In 
1970 the team was nationa l 
champion . At last year 's All 
American Huntington Beach 
contest they placed first and 
third . 

With the advent of the NSSA 
and surfing scholarships , 
collegiate competition is 
booming. Two Lowenbrau 
competitors OCC and Golden 
West College award varsity 
letters for surf team members. 

The proceeds from theSpring 
Classic went to the NSSA who 
sponsors a national team that 
recently returned rrom 
gigantic waves in Peru .

Two Sports is Too Man~ 

Hurler Abandons Hoop for Hardball 
Nicholson Will Focus 'on Pitching 
Skill, Let Last Basketball Year Go 

By Jon Halperin 
Staff Writer 

In a surprise move , junior 
Tom Nicholson has decided to 
forego his last year of 
basketball eligibility to 
concentrate on baseball . The 
Sanger, California native cited 
neither the departure of head 
bas ketball coach Barry 
Cunningham nor the rigorous 
training program of new head 
mentor Bob Kloppenberg as 
reasons. Instead, Nicholson has 
cho en to dedicate his final 
year at UCSD to developing 
what he feels is his best talent-
throwing a ba eball. 

Nicholson, a hard worker by 
na ture, has a lready begun a 
training program. He will 
continue it throughout the 
summer , in addition to 
throwing thrice weekly . In the 
fall he will attend Dartmouth 
College and hopes to work with 
the baseball team there . 
Another Triton pitcher, Tom 
Schwartz, will also be making 
the trip to the East Coast, and 
will most likely work closely 
with Nicholson. ' 

Upon his return to California , 
icholson will begin a six-week 

training progra m with his 
former high school coach in 
Sanger. By mid-January, the 
six-foot four-inch, one hundred 
and ninety pounder hopes to be 
in top form . 

Nicholson came to UC San 
Diego hoping to play both 
basketball and baseball. He 
was recruited by head coach 

Bar~y Cunningham, because of 

numerous team and league 
honors he had received. As a 
high school baseball pitcher, he 
did not pitch well until his 
senior year, due to an arm 
injury in his sophomore year 
that almost halted his pitching 
career. 

As a freshman , Nicholson 
was given a chance to play for 
the var ity basketball team at 
UCSD. This was quite a shock, 
Nicholson recalls, as he was 
ju t hoping to make the junior 
varsity sq uad. He finished the 
year as a spot starter for coach 
Lyle Olsen 's baseba ll . quad, 

As a ophomore, Nicholson 
faced a tougher academic load 
and his performances suffered 
on the basketball court as well 
as on the baseball diamond. 

This year again wa 
di appoi nting for Nichol on, 
but only in basketba ll. He was 
left behind on the team's major 
roadtrip during Christmas 
break, which turned out to be a 
blessing since the team came 
down with the Russian flu and 
generally did not perform up to 
its capabilities. 

Baseball was a different 
story. Under a new head coach, 
Vince Askey , Nicholson 
responded by pitc hing ex-
tremely well. He recorded a 
four and six record and was 
name d the team's most 
valuable hurler . His finest 
outing was a pressure packed 
one hitter agai nst powerful Cql 
Sta te Dominguez Hills. The 
contest was being cout.ed by a 
group of Canadian scouts who

were looking for players to 
participate in a summer 
league . Nicholson's oppor-
tunity to play in Canada, 
however, fell through. 

Next year Nicholson has 
decided to give baseball his full 
attention. The Tritons have 
only lost four players from this 
year's squad and some new 
recruits could make the 1980 
squad a formidable contingent. 

There is something else 
driving Tom Nicholson to put in 
nine months of hard work 
before the start of next year's 
season - the chance to play 
baseball as a profes ional. ··It 
i in the back of every college 
ballplayer's mind ," states 
Nicholson . " I would be foolish 
to ay that I don ' t have the 
same dream." 

A dream? Maybe. The last 
UC San Diego player to be 
drafted wa pitcher Randy 
Miller, now with the Montreal 
Expo. However, Nichol on has 
the ize , speed and deter-
mination that pro scouts look 
for . It will be a long, arduous 
off-season program for Tom 
Nicholson . 

Tom Nicholson has begun training already for next year' 
baseball ea on. This ea on's accompli hments as a pitcher, 
including a one-hitter against Cal State Dominguez Hills, helped 
him make up his mind to forego his other sport, basketball. 

Only. Triton at NAIA's 
Hein Out of Tennis Nat'ls 

Billy Hei n of the men's tenni 
team lost his first round si ngles 
match at the NA1A alional 
Championships in Kansas City, 
Missouri on Tuesday afternoon 
to Smith Anderson of Gilford 
College (North Carolina), 3-6,6-
0, J-6. 

The loss eliminates Hein 
from further competition in the 
prestigious NAJA tournament. 

The 21-year-Old junior from 

Eavtronmental Piau 

Tarzana, California was the 
only Triton netter to qualify for 
the NAIA Tourney. Hein won 
the District III s ingle title 
earlier this month, earning the 
trip east. Hein competl-) d 
agai nst 205 si ngles pl ayers 
representing 45 colleges from 
across the United States. 

Ending with an overall 
record of 29 wins a nd 14 losses , 
Hein compiled the econd be t 

showing on the squad this 
season . As a team , the Tritons 
compiled an 11-13 overall 
record , with nin of these losses 
coming against NCAA Division 
I schools in its own divisions 
(NA IA and NCAA DivisionIII) , 
the Tritons compiled a 6-3 
record. 

The top 10 players from this 
year's young squad will be 
eligible for competition next 
spring.

music. Many of today 's so-
called rock 'n' rollers are so 
into the steely technological 
"improvements" that it 
amounts to a type of musical 
artificial insemination . And if 
there 's one thing I'm tired of, 
it's test-tube rock. 

No one, however, can make 
such an accusation about the 
New Barbarians , featuring 
Keith Richards and Ron Wood 
of the Rolling Stones . Wood and 
Richards both have roots that 
go way back to the earlier days 
of rock; days when rock 'n' roll 
was shot straight from the hip 
and the word was improvising, 
not synthesizing. 

In antici pation , one thing that 
impressed me a bout th e 
!3arbarians tour was that they 
didn 't have to tour. Richards 
and Wood wanted to do it, 
representing the first time 
Keith had toured without the 
entire Stones lineup. The tour, 
initially at least, drew some 
similarity to Bob Dylan's 
Rolling Thunder Revue of a few 
years back, with big-nam e 
mu icians traveling under a 
different banner. Such names 
as Neil Young, David Bowie, 
Jimmy Page, Ringo Starr and 
Dylan himself ha d been 
mentioned specu latively as to 
who might have appeared with 
the band. in addition to the 
feverish Jagger rumor. 

When the band landed in San 
Diego , rumors of a Jagger 

appearance were still in the air. 
After all , promoter Larry 
Vall on (formerly with Wolf &I 
Rissmiller Concerts) had 
signed the Barbarians after 
they had already scheduled the 
Los Angeles date to end the 
tour, making San Diego the new 
end-of-the-line. The Rolling 
Stones always seemed to run 
out of blow before they could 
get to San Diego, so the 
prospect of a Stones happening 

was at least intriguing. 
But the Barbarians hadn't 

even time to get "into the 
groove" musically before the 
fireworks started at their 
Sports Arena concert. Over-
zealous fans met overzealous 
bouncers at stage right , 
triggering the first of numerous 
mini-battles and causing Keith 
to shed his guitar in disgust 
over the he avy- handed 
security. Indeed, the action in 

Ron Wood. who toured whh Keith Richards, 
Stones. In the New Barbarians. 

front of the stage lent the affair 
an excited energy ; the aura of a 
Stones event was still intact . 

After opening testily and 
rather drunkenly with Chuck 
Berry's "Sweet Little Rock 'n' 
Roller ," the band seemed to 
gain energy from the stage 
front activity and settled into a 
raunchy, blistering rock show 
featuring Richards' power 
guitar riffs . The concert also 
se rved the purpose of 
promoting Woody's solo 
Gimme Some Neck, performed 
in the grand 01' tradition of rock 
'n ' roll by a uperb band: 
Stanley Clarke on bas , Ziggy 
Modeliste on drum s, Jan 
McLagen on piano and Bobby 
Keyes on saxophone. The fact 
that J agger didn 't show was , of 
cou rse, a disappointment , but 
not an unexpected one. 

Veteran Stones fans knew 
what to expect, for , mu ically, 
the Barbarians lived true to 
their name with a set as raw 
and powerful as any seen on 
s tage . But their set was 
deficient in some notable areas, 
namely in material selection 
and, early in the set. in the 
guitar playing. 

Much of the material culled 
from Woody 's so lo Ips was no 
better than mediocre, de pite 
the fact that " living legends" 
were performing it. Other rock 
standard went over well, a 
did the Stones numbers ("Love 
in Vain , " " Honky Tonk 
Woman ," " Before They Make 
Me Run ," " JullJping Jack 
Flash") . even iI Mick wasn't

Characters 
Metaphysical 

T h e UCSD Theatre is presenting Orestes. Ores-
tes , an adaptation of 

Aeschylus' Orestia, as its last 
produ ctio n of the year . 
Performances will continue 
through this Sunday, June 2, at 
9 pm on the Central Library 
Plaza . 

The Orestia dates back to the 
6th Century before Christ. It 
tell the story of an ancient 
conflict between two royal 
brothers. This conflict becomes 
dark in the course of the play 's 
action, involvi ng intra-familial 
murder; a husband, a mother 
and two lovers are killed in a 
sort of inexorable chain-
reaction, which i stopped only 
by the intervention of "divine" 
justice. 

In discussing the production, 
director Dr. Michael Addison 
likened the task to that of 
translation, explaining that he 
was concerned with being 
faithful to the play and its 
culture, while at the same time 
ma king the play " available" to 
a modern audience. One of his 
most successful innovations in 
this direction is the intro-
duction of The Knower, a 
frowsy modern Greek played 
by Mark Browning . The 
Knower introduces the play, 
tells the story and comments on 
the ac'tion throughout, with a 
weary but probing befuddle-
ment which turns to amazed 
silence as the denouement is 
reached. This speaking witness 
goes a long way toward 
bringing the audience closer to 
the play 's concerns. 

Another innovation is the 
addition of modern dress, worn 
by all the mortal characters. 
This tends to confuse the 
viewers' signals a bit, as the 
actors ' speeches , while 
condensed from the original, 
are still long and fl atulent. Dan 
Osman, the actor playing 
Orestes, mentioned to me that 
he and the cast were "trying a 
little too hard" to fill their roles 
during the early shows, and Dr. 
Addison noted that this attempt 
to reconcile the mythic 
qualities of the characters 
with their humanness is a 
major concern. For me, the 
humanness of these main 
characters came through not 
at a ll ; I found myself 
continually thinking of the 
characters in terms of their 
metaphysical mec ha ni cal , 
rather than human, function. 
The most touching portrayals 
(in the modern sense) were Mr. 
Harding ' s Knower and , 
paradoxically, some of the 
chorus members, a ll of whom 
car ried small papier-mache 
masks, using them to great 
adva ntage in expressing fear, 
rage, sorrow and pity. 

The use of Central Library's 
plaza as a stage lend s 
magnificence to this produc-
tion , with the gray permanence 
and hulking angularity of the 
library towering above. The 
scene of action is moved twice, 
to suit the place repre ented. 
Thi has its trongest effect in 
Act II , when Oreste (and the 
audience) is queezed between 
the tomb of his father and the 
home of his father's murderer, 
agonizing over the neces ily 
of vengeance. Elizabeth Rouls

Wood 's incessant clowning that 
detracted most from the music.

'Hanover St.' Lines Trite, Acting True 

Harrison Ford and Lesley-Anne Down rail in love in wartime London. 

E ver since Rocky a-chieved critical and financial success , 
cliches have been in style. 
Directors no longer have to feel 
asha med of their sentimen· 
tality and some even go so far 
as to flaunt it in your face . The 
latest in this trend is the World 
War II romance, Hanover 
Street . Unlike Rocky, Hanover 
Street fail s to revitalize enough 
of the cliches to make it 
refreshingly successful ' 
instead, it offers innocuou~ 
ente rta inment , an attractive 
cast a nd a beautiful se tting. 

Hanover Street dea ls with a 
fam i ~i a r type of love tria ngle 
tha t Involves a British woman 
(Le ley-Anne Down ), he r 
husband (Chris topher Plum-
mer) and her American lover 
(Harrison Ford). Dowll a nd 
Ford meet by accident in 
London and then f, II quickly in 
love. Their roma nce, however. 
is interrupted when Ford is 
required to pilot a plane for a 
secret mission . On th is m ission 
Ford finds himself worki ng 
with a Br iti h intelligence 
agent who ha ppen to be 
PI ummer. Afte r the mission the 
plot shift back to London 
where the three characters 
re olve thei r re lationships. 

The perform ers ar Ha nover 
Stree t's most va lua ble asset. 
Down. on of the love liest 
actresses in film , is requi red to 
d e li ver th e film 's m os t 
hackneyed line , yet her inna te 
elega nce still shines through. 
Her presence lends Ha nover 
Street a war m g low; I only wish 

he had been given m ore 

substantial material. Ford 
(who has now taken to flying a 
bomber instead of a Millenium 
Falcon) has a subdued 
cynicism which counteracts 
some of his characters' cliches. 
Unfortunately, his romantic 
scenes with Down are the film 's 
weakest points - only the 
performers' charms pull them 
through. Ford fares much 
better in the action scenes or in 
the scenes with his buddies. 

The dialogue by Peter Hyams 
fo r m s the film 's flim s ies t 
e le m e nt a nd prevents th e 
deve lopment of a ny depth . 
Hya m s tri es to crea te a 
roma nce like The White Cliffs 
of DO'ver , bulin tead he crea tes 
love scenes whi ch sound like a 
Ha rlequin romance. Hyam s, 
howevcr, w ri tes far m ore 
credible dialogue in th scene 
involving only the men. 

Hyams directs the film 
smoothly a nd give it a fortie 
look. David Watkin 's lush 
IJhotography a nd J ohn Barry '

co mplements to the film ' tone.

Rec Referendum Still On YesiNo Vote Over 
'Third' This Week (Continued from pale I) marshal personnel ambiguities 

and a marshals' charter which 
has not received any formal 
approval. 

Council members said they 
were uncomforta ble with the 
lack of provisions for 
relulation, enforcement , 
funding and participation 
quotas in the charter, 
according to Montalvo. 

Elcan said he believed part of 
the problem was a lack of 
communications caused by the 
recent change in AS Council 
membership (current mem-
bers took o(fice only a month 
ago). 

"They were provided with all 
the same written information 
with which the graduate 
council was provided," Elcan 
said. 

That information included 
student surveys, the proposed 
facilities charter and a cover 
letter noting that the Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage had agreed 
to • ' underwrite such a 
referendum. " 

The catch is, Elcan said, at 
the time that particular 
package was sent (April 17). it 
could have been received by the 
previous council. 

Other information whi ch 
apparently was only partially 
available to the AS Council 
were the second two pages of a

believed that his council would 
not endorse the referendum 
until that policy was handed 
down in writing from the 

Regents. He also said that, 
despite the two-hour meetiAI 
Thursday with Elcan, the 
council wanted to see all of the 
information in writing, " more 
publicity on the proposal" and a 
revised marshal's charter 
before it would give its consent 
to conducting the referendum. 

However, because the AS is 
only one-third of the elections 
marshal board , the referendum 
will be conducted regardless of 
that undergraduate body ' s 
vote, Elcan and Registration 
Fee Committee Chair Kenzie 
Nicoll said. Polls will be in the 
plazas near the Revelle, Muir 
and Third College cafeterias, at 
the university and medical 
school bookstores a nd at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanog-
raphy snack bar. 

'Orestes' is Magic, 
Not Entertainment 

(Continued from page 9) 
and the chorus of mourners 
send shivers up the spine with 
their ululating lament. 

A credibility problem arises 
in the third act, with the 
introduction of the gods Apollo 
and Athene (as Dr . Addison 
said, "how do you deal with 
gods? " ). Apollo is ensconced in 
a glittering box, brightly lit, 
and it's a credit to Kevin Bash 
(that's right, Kevin Bash) that 
he isn't overwhelmed by the 
gimmickry surrounding 
Apollo's portrayal. 

The et a nd lighting design is 
ingenious. In fact , I could 
recommend Orestes , Orestes 
on thi strength alone to anyone 
interested in the theatre itself, 
but it 's difficult to recomr:lend 
thi play to those seeking only 
e ntertai nme nt. In this age 

where murder occurs every 
minute o r so in the media and 
on the street , where dea th 
seems so trivialized, the 

. recreation of such a chain of 
death as the Orestia can appear 
insignificant. An appreciation 
of Orestes, Orestes demands 
the viewer's active partici-
pation, for this is not just the 
story of a family feud , but a 
ritual of inten iCication, an 
enactment of the formulation of 
the feeble synthesis which 
underlies every as pect of 
western law. 

If you look at Ores tes , 
Orestes the way you look at TV 
or movies it is a bore , but if you 
look at it as the recreation of a 
vital cultural event by Ul e 
bones Li nd blood of your fellow 
LUdents, it become a feLit of 

magic. 

Third students will have their 
final say on the name for the 
college this week. 

The final yes/no vote for 
"Third" will be considered 
valid only if 50 percent of the 
total college population votes. 

Students will be able to vote 
through Friday at the Third 
Dean's office, Third Resident 

Dean's office, Third College 
quad and in front of the Main 
Gym steps. 

Third students must show 
their·lDs to vote . 

Based on the results of the 
preference ballot, Third was 
the name selected by the Third 
College' Council to appear on 
the final ballot. 

Warren Dean's Leave 
Puts Asst. in Charge 

By Tobias Raymond 
Sl.aff Writer 

Julie Gordon, assi tant dean 
a t Warren College will replace 
Dean Gary Frost during his 
leave of ab ence in the 1979-80 
academic year. 

Gordon has been a member of 
the Warren admi nist ration 
since last July. Prior to her 
a ppointment as assistant dean 
she had been serving in a 
si mil ar capacity at the 
Univer ity of Kansas . 

Citing Gordon's past 
experience at a large 
university and her familiarity 
with the UCSD aca demic 
environment, Fro t a id he 
expects a " very mooth" 
transition between deans. 

In addition to her duties as 
dean, Gordon will head the 
Warren Academic Internship 
Program , which provides 
students with an opportunity to 
gain on-the-job experience in 
their field of study. 

Frost's departure marks the 
third time a UCSD d ean has 
withdrawn from ofCice in the 

past year. Last February, 
Beverly Varga, Third College 
de an, requested several 
months ' leave of absence due to 
health reasons . J im Beckley , 
Muir dean , voluntarily 
resigned last fall under 
pressure stemming from 
criminal charges. 

According to Paul Saltman, 
the departures appear to be 
coi nCidence . Due to their 
diversity, it is impossible to 
draw a parallel between them, 
he said. 

Saltman also said he does not 
a nticipate any "crippling 
efiects" to the university as a 
re:;ult of the dean withdrawals. 
although he added , " the 
'pn'gram is always hurt when 
yo\> lose ta lented people ." 

An Acting Assistant Dean 
will be hired after advertising 
the position on both a local and 
regi'lnal level , said Gordon. 

According to Gordon, the 
position should be filled by late 
June, allowing a replacement 
to begin work next fall. 

'No Confidence' Vote Goes to Mail 
(Continued from page 12) 
would not res ign hi s office noW. 
but tha t he would have to " think 
about it" if the mail ballot 
yields the same results as last 
night's meeting. 

He attributed the Senate's 
decision to that body being 
" over excited by a minor 
a dministrative change ... } 
didn 't do a good enough job in 
explaining the move to them," 

McElroy added. 
Faculty members expressed 

co nc em in the Senate meeting 
beca use e veral academic 
per onnel files are now before 
McElroy, who is acting vice 
chancellor of academic affairs. 
They want the files before 
someone "who knows the 
professors and who has been 
following th e case ." one 
Senate member a id in 

ex plai ning why th e Senate 
voted to ask Saltman to return 
to hi s former post. 

Several professo r s, who 
asked not to be identified, 
expressed co n cer n th a t 
McElroy might intervene in 
tenure cases now before the 
Academic Affairs office. 

Attention to considera tion of 
the no con fidence resolution 
was diverted at the beginning of

ca meras from channels 39 and

The Senate then voted to 
remove all press and observers 
from its session, but shortly 
thereafter a llowed all to return 
except the c::ameras .
