AS moves offices, endorses 
investigation of right wingers 

At their Tuesday meeting the AS voted to r eallocate $230 to the 
Ocean Beach day care center . The money was on gmally 
alloted to the center last summer but nobody came to cla im It 
until last week . after the AS council had voted to move the 
money back Into the general fund 

It was pointed out by George Murphy vice chancellor of 
student affairs. that AS finding of the day care cent r may not 
comply with the regents gUld lines for th expenditure of 
student funds because It provides li ttle beneCtt to students. A 
president Paul Kaufman endor ed th funding 01 the c nter on 
the grounds that UCSD students " are part of a larger 
community" Juan Lopez. commiSSIOn r of communll~ 
services also supported the day care center because as he put 
It. " We shouldn 't let George Murphy tell us how to spend our 
money " 

In oth r actIOn Kaufman revealed that the A. commissioners 
will surrender their offices to the National Black CI nce 
Organtza tlon The commiSSIOner Will share office, pace With 
a group call d Talent Search It Will cost the stud nt: 100 to

Action is the Difference 
By Paul ~aufman 

AS President 
Will it make anv difference 
now that the 18 to' 20 year olds 
have the vote? 

Possibly not many 
tudents are doubtful that the 

present electoral system can 
respond to the needs or wishe 
of the majortty of AmeTlcans , 
many have re Igned 
themselves to !'latlonai Parties 
whIch select their candidates 
by a process of back-room

I. X is a second year male graduate student teaching 
Humanities in Hevelle College, hired as a third-time T.A .. 
which means he must be responsible for forty to sixty students 
for two quarters and 20 to 30 students (or one quarter . For eacb 
quarter, books often new to him must be read and understood 
so he can explain them and induce directed dISCUSSIon about 
them, X is responsible for grading as many as 180 papers and 
up to two exams per quarter . And this is the minimal work 
expected from him . 

If his students need help with their writing, who will help 
lhem! X will . in conference with each student The professor 
has no such "responsibility", he has too man\' students. And 
for X, Ibis is nOI a formal responsibility; it is the work X mu t 
do In order to teach effectively. If he does not do thl work . the 
undergraduates suffer the con equences: as they are ~ow 
suffering when a T,A. cannot relegate all hIS lime to prepanng.

the problems of understanding the material and enJoymg the 
pleasures of understanding it. X. In order to do an even 
adequate job, musl work more than he I paid for. . 

Full-time is defined as tom' hours of work a week : half-lIme 
IS therefore deftned as twenty. To the sne nng faculty member 
who has pointed out that X spends less than 20 hours a week

teaching assistants are bired to do - and the problem is that 
the T,A .. as a worker or as a student, is in no way 
acknowledged as an important part of the working community. 
Work done is called " support" and T,A, or R.A , ships are given 
by some departments as a reward for "merit" instead of as a 
response to the graduate students ' economic needs. The 
assumption that defines a community of T,A. 's is then not that 
we are hired to do a job. to fill a necessary position, but that we 
are generously given the opportunity to give , allowed the 
opportunity to work. Some departments require T.A.'sto teac.h 
without being paid : some T.A. 's are not given academIC credIt 
for teaching. The University ('ould nol successfull~. exist 
without our work. imagine any of the Introductory wfltlng or 
literature clas es without individual tutoring from T,A.'s: 
imagine a physics class of two hundred students taught by one 
profe sor. Professors are already lecturing to overcrowded 
classes. classe too large for discu sian or questioning to take 
place. T.A.·s are. in many cases, the onlv contact a student can 
have with an inter-communicattve learning process. And to do 
the job well, the aVl;'rage T.A, must work more than he or she is 
paid [or. in a community that will not recognize the T,A. as a 
valuable and necessarv member, 

3. Becau eTA '5' are not Individually recognized as 
important member of the larger ntversity community,. we 
must our elves organize as a body so our n eds can be defined

Rugby Team SDl8shes SD State 
The UCSD number-one rugby team, coming to life in the 

Saturday sunshine, rolled on by a usually tough San Diego State 
rugby team, 36-7 , After a tough week of practices to remedy 
the problems that cost our ruggers a poor showing in a prior 
t?urnament , everyone on the team played good ball , as we saw 
SIX UCSD players cross the line to score, 

The g~me was actually closer than the score indicated , as 
the opentng seconds of the first half saw one State rugger lower 
hIS head and charge downfield, believing he was going to total 
at least one UCSD rugger. But unbeknownst to him , he 
rammed Into the "man of steel," John Ringwood, and lost the 
ball as well as hIS head , !n the e.arly going of the game, the play 
went up and down the fIeld , WIth both teams looking more at 
the sun than the ball, when suddenly the "mad scalpel" Paul 
Llebow carved hIS way through the opposition for a score, 
Minutes later KeIth " krunched" Kaplan followed the doctor in 
to make the score 8-0, But only to our dismay, "Golden Foot" 

Crew Warms Up 
Our intercollegiate crew 

team exhibited great potential 
In 111'0 preseason regattas at 
Lonl( Beach last quarter . The 
ftrst regatta at Thanksgiving 
saw the UCSD rowers finesse 
Ihelr way into two fir t place 
flntshes The fIrst victory was 
gamed when Morgan Johnson, 
Tom Evans. Mike Crov ltz , and 
Frank Sherlock powered theIr 
four man s hell to an 
overwhelming five boal-length 
Win These four then teamed up 
WIth John Reynolds, Mark 
Brosseau, David Gallina , and 
Tom Rhoades to Win the elght-
man race against ftve tough 
competttors.

Gates was now "Brown foot" Gates (must have been 
something he stepped in ) and could not ftnd the uprigh' , to 
score the converSIons, Our overconfident ruggers thought the 
party was going to begin now, and let San DIego State sneak 
back to WIthIn one for an 8-7 halftime score. 

After a brief break to regroup their forces, the UCSD ruggers 
came out for blood , John " Begonia" Hubert was the fIrst to 
show how easy it was to slide through their lines, as he 
unselftshly settled for assists (assists don 't make the stats, 
John) and he dished olf fir st to Dickie Duncan fis thIS how he 
gets all his scores?) and then to Doctor Paul Llebow for his 
second try . Not wishing to be left unnoticed, little plggie Doug 
Beanan ground his way single-handed through San Diego 's 
backfield for still another UCSD score. ow everybody wanted 
to be a hero, and so Scot Young and Jim Viglenzone broke theIr 
backs with two more CSD tnes. In order to replace Gates 
veteran reserve kickers John " Ringer" Wood and Scot Young 
scored conversIon to lead CSD off the field 36-7 vIctors over 
San Diego State. 

As the UCSD I team came out drinking. the CCSD II 's came 
out plaYing as they were matched up against another monster 
team, UDTfSeals I Fighting inexperience as well as 
the other team, the rookle-ruggers played hard, but found 
themselves down 12-3 at the half. 

After a brief intermIssion, we found our heroe , inspIred bv 
the halftime entertainment and the cheenng of the huge crowd 
that gathered to watch theIr gladiators fight the second team to 
the death, struggling behind the moves of "Gvro" Pnce and 
"Tom Jones" Bender, and trying to pull It o·ff. but WIthout 
Cuda out ther laYIng down interference In the mIddle of the 
fIeld , the only thing that came off was Bill Gate' trunks 
although they'd been down earlier when he tried to kIck for th~ 
extra points . The game ended with UDT /Seals on lOp 19-6. 

Th.en for those UCSD and SDSC ruggers drunk enough to keep 
playing. there was another game. The thIrd game of the 
Saturday triple-header pitted the Drunkards against CDT 
Seals' econd team By thIS time everyone was smashed and a 
slopp{ game wa the result with the Seals coming out on top 
7-4 NeIther team had enoul(h together to fil(ur out how to 
score, partly because everyone was plaving the po Ilion they 
always wanted to pla~' but could never fil(ure out whv the\' 
COUldn't, . . 

As the sunet In the we l, our rugger passed out on the 
honzon ending another thnlltng epl ode In the annals of IT D
