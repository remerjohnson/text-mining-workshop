California voters soundly rejected 
five of six ballot measures in the 
state’s special election Tuesday, bar-
ring the Legislature from relocating 
funds as a short-term fix to the cur-
rent budget crisis. 

The only measure that 
passed — by an over-
whelming 74 percent of 
voters — was Proposition 
1F, which will freeze 
salaries of state lawmak-
ers during deficit years. 
Because California will be 
$21.3 billion in the red 
beginning July 1, this will 
include 2009-10. 

“The message was loud 
and clear,” Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger said in 
a statement. “An over-
whelming majority of peo-
ple told Sacramento, ‘Go 
and do your work your-
self. Don’t come to us with 
your problems.’”

Propositions 1A-1E, 
which were rejected by more than 
60 percent of voters, sought to reach 
mandatory funding goals by redi-
recting roughly $5.9 billion toward 
the state’s general-revenue funds. 

Proposition 1A would have estab-
lished state spending caps and pro-
longed recent tax increases, while 
Proposition 1B attempted to cushion 
future cuts to education by requiring 
the state to pay $9.3 billion toward 
California K-12 schools and com-
munity colleges. Propositions 1C-1E 
would have borrowed money from 

California lottery profits, California 
Children and Families Commission 
reserves and mental-health program 
funds, respectively. 

Because of the failure of 
Propositions 1A and 1B, California’s 
public colleges and universities will 
be subject to additional cuts in state 
support of up to 10 percent. The 
University of California will be hit 
with a $765 million slash to top off 
the $115 million cut to the system 
that was announced three months 
ago. 

“Such severe budget reduction, 
following years of chronic under-

funding, would force 
the university to weigh a 
number of stark choices,” 
UC President Mark G. 
Yudof said in a state-
ment. “At this point, all 
options must be placed 
on the table for consid-
eration at some point in 
the future.”

According to Yudof, 
these options include 
slicing enrollment, aca-
demic programs and 
student services while 
boosting student fees 
and class sizes, in addi-
tion to pay reductions or 
furloughs for university 
employees. The failure of 
the ballot measures will 
also trim state support 

for student aid. 
Jack Pitney, a political-science pro-

fessor at Claremont McKenna College, 
said state lawmakers will have little 
choice but take funds from political-
ly sacred avenues such as education, 
since the public seems to want more

The A.S. Council’s annual bud-
get talks got off to an early start 
last night, when new President Utsav 
Gupta proposed a structural overhaul 
that would delay most financial allo-
cations until Fall Quarter and modify 
the council’s savings plan.

Traditionally, the council approves 
the president’s allocations to events, 
programs, enterprises and student 
organizations during ninth week of 
Spring Quarter. But Gupta said last 
night that these decisions are always 
based on estimations, since campus 
enrollment figures and the council’s 
financial carry-forward are not final-

ized until fall. 
Not to mention, he added, three 

weeks in office does not afford much 
time for deliberation.

“Oftentimes, we just copy and 
paste the old budget because that’s 

convenient and it’s all we have time 
to do,” Gupta said. “That’s not the 
smartest way to allocate.”

His solution is to limit spring allo-

DANIEL CADDELL/GUARDIAN
Under construction since October 2007, the North Campus Housing facility will cater specifically to 
transfer students, but may be opened to nontransfer undergraduates if space permits.

By Kelly Pleskot
Staff Writer

Construction began Monday on 
phase two of the North Campus 
Housing project, which cost over 
$97 million and is expected to pro-
vide housing for 807 transfer stu-
dents upon completion in fall 2011.

The second phase of the project 
consists of erecting seven build-
ings ranging from one to 13 sto-

ries in height. Once construction 
is complete, there will be 146 four-, 
five- and six-bedroom apartments 
for students and two three-bedroom 
apartments for staff. 

This phase of construction will 
also include a bistro — the Strand 
— and an adjacent market. Building 
plans also allot space for a cen-
tralized reception area, conference 
and meeting rooms, administrative 
offices and maintenance and custo-
dial spaces.

According to Housing and 
Dining Services Director Mark 
Cunningham, construction is five 
months ahead of schedule. 

Overall, this phase of construc-

tion will envelop over 266,000 square 
feet, encompassing parking lot P-357, 
located at Scholars Drive North and 
North Point Drive.

The first phase of construction is 
composed of eight buildings, taking 
up 370,000 square feet of space and 
includes a 14-story residential tower, 
a bookstore, cafe and space for 1,060 
incoming transfer students who will 
move in fall 2009. It cost $122 million 
to build.

Project Manager Mark Nelson said 
the goal is to house 2,000 transfer stu-
dents per year. 

“At this point, we don’t see any real 
obstacles,” he said. “We’re doing OK 
financially.”

However, Cunningham said the 
construction may affect vehicular 
traffic next fall.

“I expect the largest impact will 
be this fall, when we are completing 
phase one and moving in the resi-
dents while phase two is under con-
struction,” he said. “The site is fairly 
user friendly compared to some other 
projects on the campus, so I think the 
impact will be minimal.”

He added that the new buildings 

may also offer housing to nontransfer 
upper-division students, if space is 
available.

“The campus goal is to be able to 
provide a front-end, two-year guar-
antee to incoming transfer students 
like we do for our freshpersons, and 
within that goal, provide a commu-
nity that can meet as many of their 
needs as possible,” Cunningham said.

Community Coordinator Molly 
Hansen said that incoming transfer 
students would get priority housing in 
the new complex. 

“If there’s extra room, it’ll go to 
the continuing [transfer] students,” 
she said.

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Design and Construction Boone 
Hellmann said the buildings include 
features designed to enhance their 
sustainability.

To help naturally regulate temper-
ature, they will be primarily oriented 
in an east-west alignment. 

They will also be installed with 
plumbing fixtures that promote low 
water usage, an efficient roof-drain-
age system for landscape irrigation 
and porous paving along the Strand’s 
walkway. Low-emittance window 

coating will allow for reduced energy 
usage.

The U.S. Green Building Council 
— a certification system that mea-
sures the capacity for buildings to save 
energy, conserve water and reduce 
carbon-dioxide emissions while pre-
serving the quality of the indoor 
environment — has granted the 
project a Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design “silver” rat-
ing. Cunningham hopes to achieve a 
“gold” rating by the end of the project.

Cunningham said he hopes the 
new housing development will help 
create a welcoming community for 
transfer students.

“My hope [is] that when this is 
completed, we have a neighborhood 
that everyone feels comfortable, 
safe and happy living in,” he said. “I 
hope that every student living there 
has opportunities to be part of the 
neighborhood and takes advantage 
of those opportunities. Finally, I hope 
and believe we have brought a hous-
ing program that is very unique and 
relevant.”

Last night’s A.S. meeting got off to a sluggish start, due to tech-nical difficulties involving the 
microphones and projection screen. 
Members of the public waited to 
showcase their PowerPoint presenta-
tions while various councilmembers 
scrambled around, fiddling with wires 
and electronics throughout the forum.

John Muir College Council Chair 
Daisy Chavez greeted the entire coun-
cil and gifted members with green 
highlighters before rushing off to take 
a quiz.

M e m b e r s 
from the Student 
S u s t a i n a b i l i t y 
Collective pro-
moted their 
Resolution in 
Support of Water 
Conservation at 
UCSD, and also provided an update 
on the formation of the Sustainability 
Resource Center. They presented their 
charter, and also discussed the struc-
ture of the collective, so as to answer 
any questions before the council voted 
on the matter.

Following the presentations, 
President Utsav Gupta provided some 
“institutional memory” before pro-
posing that the council “only allocate 
what is necessary now to get to fall,” 
and utilize income from the various 
A.S. enterprises so as to be less depen-
dent on student fees.

His proposed changes sparked a 
lengthy question-and-answer session 
following the end of his slideshow.

“It needs to cover at least the 
big events that happen in the fall,” 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Frank Carroll pointed out.

Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Garrett Berg 
stepped up to the mic after Gupta 
for one last presentation at his final 
meeting. He brought the council mint-

condition baby Sun Gods and wel-
comed any and all questions regarding 
last Friday’s Sun God Festival, most 
of which concerned wristbands and 
water bottles.

“Fifteen thousand people pan-
icked, and you can’t process 15,000 
people at once,” Berg said as an expla-
nation for the frightfully long wrist-
band line on Friday morning. “But we 
never ran out of wristbands, so next 
year, people know not to panic.”

After addressing people’s ques-
tions, Berg shifted gears to discuss the 

delicate and com-
plicated matter of 
the reorganization 
of the Concerts 
and Events Office, 
which is neces-
sary due to the 
immense time 

commitment required of all office staff 
and affiliates.

Various amendments were made 
to the sustainability-related items on 
the agenda before they were approved, 
to the relief of the ever-patient mem-
bers of the Social and Environmental 
Sustainability Committee.

The appointment of associate 
vice president positions went fairly 
smoothly, but snagged when the 
appointment of Aries Yumul for the 
position of AVP local affairs was brief-
ly contested on the basis that there 
may not have been enough senators 
present for the interview process. His 
appointment was sealed with 10 ayes 
and 11 abstentions.

Toward the end of the meeting, the 
entire council sang “Happy Birthday” 
to Campuswide Senator Alex Vu, 
while Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena enthusiastically picked him up 
and spun him around.

“I just want to congratulate everyone 
for having a responsible Sun God and 
not winding up at detox,” Carroll said.

cations to only the most immediate 
budgetary needs — such as the creation 
of new staff positions and major pro-
grams — and save the remaining items 
until the beginning of Fall Quarter.

Though there is still no consensus 
regarding what the council’s imme-
diate funding priorities will be, A.S. 
Concerts and Events and A.S. Graphic 
Studio have already requested new 
staff members, and there is a list of 
programs and events that either take 
place over the summer or require 
funding guarantees in advance.

“If you’re going to do it this way, it 
needs to at least cover the big events 
of the fall, so that people know that 
money will be there,” Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy Frank 
Carroll said. “It takes months and 
months to plan these events.”

With a boost from this winter’s fee 
referendum, the council will not be 
short on cash next year. Gupta esti-
mated that the A.S. budget will total 
$3.1 million, up from $1.8 million last 
year, and he said he is determined to 
spend — and save — this money wisely. 

His plan includes two substantial 
changes to the A.S. reserves system. 
First, he wants to transfer next fall’s 
carry-forward — historically treated as 
a bonus to the annual budget — to A.S. 
Mandate Reserves to insure against less 
successful years. Alongside the 5 per-
cent of the total budget the council puts 
aside annually, these new savings would 
likely push Mandate Reserves above 
$1.2 million in 2009-10, Gupta said.

Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Garrett Berg sug-
gested reducing or eliminating the 5 
percent mandate to keep the account 
from swelling too much. Gupta said he 
is open to the idea of a reduction, but 
that it would require an amendment to 
the A.S. Standing Rules.

Gupta also recommended open-
ing a new Enterprise Stability Reserve 
account to regulate A.S. enterprise rev-
enue and prevent year-to-year fluc-
tuations from impacting the council’s 
annual budget. Under his plan, the 
council would determine an acceptable 
rate of revenue variance — most likely 
around 10 percent — for its enter-
prises. It would then feed money into 

and away from individual businesses 
depending on their annual profits.

Carroll criticized the plan, citing 
its lack of “failure mechanisms” for 
unsuccessful enterprises and empha-
sizing that current students’ money 
should be invested in current students.

“It seems like we’re going to be 
taking a lot of money away from cur-
rent students to pay for future debts,” 
he said. “At what point do we define 
failure? If we keep using this to sub-
sidize failures, we’re never going to 
make money. We shouldn’t just use 
this to cover our butts.”

Gupta said his primary goal is to 
relieve the council of its dependence 
on student activity fees and reinvest 
in A.S. enterprises.

“None of these details are fixed, but 
we need to create the process by which 
we can become more dependent on our 
[enterprise] income and less dependent 
on taxing our students,” he said.

The council will review Gupta’s 
spring budget proposal next week.

than they’re willing to pay for. 
“For a lot of people, the budget’s 

been an abstraction,” Pitney said. “But 
with the next round, there will prob-
ably be serious consequences, partic-
ularly in the schools. Democrats have 
taken heat for accepting spending 
cuts. Certain Republicans have taken 
heat for accepting tax increases, and 
the heat’s only going to get more 
intense this summer.”

After election results were 
announced Tuesday evening, 
Schwarzenegger flew to Washington, 
D.C., the next morning to request 
federal stimulus money for the state.

In a meeting with Health and 
Human Services Secretary Kathleen 
Sebelius, Schwarzenegger was informed 
that California remains eligible to 
receive another $8 billion in stimulus 
money for its Medicaid program.

“The rest of it we have to do our-
selves in California,” Schwarzenegger 
said. “We’ve made it clear that we’re not 
asking for a bailout. We’re not asking 
for any money we don’t deserve under 
the economic stimulus package.”

The governor began closed-door 
meetings with state leaders yesterday. 
Today, Senate and Assembly mem-
bers will hold the first of many daily 
public sessions planned to work out 

budget details.  
Last week, Schwarzenegger 

announced plans to lay off 5,000 
of the state’s 235,000 workers, slash 
education funding by up to $5 bil-
lion, sell state properties, borrow $2 
billion from local governments and 
reduce eligibility for health-care pro-
grams. 

Schwarzenegger also proposed 
the state release and deport 19,000 
illegal immigrants from prisons, as 
well as transfer nearly 23,000 other 
prisoners to county jails.

As part of the UC Office of the President’s plan to achieve a zero-waste uni-
versity by 2020, students have been 
separating their food scraps into 
dining-hall compost bins since Fall 
Quarter, thanks to Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality at UCSD.

But as of now, the scraps are then 
tossed in with the trash because 
there isn’t a place to compost the 
material yet.

“The composting program is 
a training program to get people 
used to the idea of separating their 
waste,” said Krista Francis, sustain-
ability manager for Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality.

Food scraps will be hauled to 
the Miramar landfill’s composting 
facility once proper permits are 
obtained.

I wanted to see how the well the 
“training” was going, so I stationed 
myself by the numerous compost 
bins adjacent to the cafeterias in 
John Muir College, Revelle College 
and Earl Warren College.

I noticed bright yellow signs that 
read “Compost” with a description 
below: “Food (no bones), dispos-
ables (cups, plates, napkins), check 
the Web site for the full list.” But the 
majority of students just ignored 
these instructions and tossed all 
their trash into the nearest bin. 

At first, it sounds silly that we’re 
being trained to compost, but this 
actually makes a lot of sense. Most 
of us don’t normally separate our 
waste, and composting requires a 
change in our habitual behavior.

But this change won’t happen if 
there isn’t some understanding of 
why we should be doing it.

I talked to a couple students at 
the dining hall, and most of them 
didn’t even know what compost is 
and why it makes a difference to 
throw a plastic wrapper in the trash-
can and toss leftover food into the 
compost bin.

Compost is comprised of organ-
ic matter broken down into nutri-
ents. As organic matter falls to the 
ground, it slowly decays and recy-
cles minerals and nutrients needed 
for plants, animals and other organ-
isms to thrive.

We can compost everyday items 
like paper napkins, apple cores, veg-
etable stalks and bread. But a good 
rule of thumb is that if it’s made of 
natural ingredients (read: not plas-
tic), it can be composted. 

Once the material is collected, 
we can speed up the process by 
using worms (vermicomposting) or 
making piles that attract microor-
ganisms that break down and return 
nutrients to the earth.

The plants and animals that we 
consume take nutrients from the 
soil, and compost is a way of replen-
ishing the land’s lost nutrients.

According to the Environmental 
Protection Agency, compost enrich-
es the soil, helps clean up con-
taminated soil and helps prevent 
pollution. Composting for fertilizer

Things are looking pretty dicey on the state budget front these days. Then again, everyone 
pretty much knew that already.

But that didn’t stop voters on 
Tuesday from decisively rejecting five 
ballot measures designed to absolve 
at least part of the massive bud-
get deficit that currently threatens to 
drag California’s ailing economy all 
the way to the floor. 

Proposition 1A, backed by high-
er-education leaders and most state 
officials, gained less than 40 percent 
approval. Propositions 1B, 1C, 1D 
and 1E fared no better. The only mea-
sure that did pass was Proposition 1F, 
which will implement a largely sym-
bolic and ultimately useless cap on 
legislative salaries during deficit years. 

Admittedly, these measures were 
a rather meek attempt at repairing 
California’s leaky fiscal plumbing. 
With a budget deficit of over $20 bil-
lion, the damage is much too deep for 
any such cosmetic financial maneu-
vering to have a meaningful impact. 

However, this somewhat ill-con-
ceived ballot package would have 
cleared up at least $5 billion from the 
state’s unsightly deficit and 1A would 
have steered California on a progres-
sive path to future savings.

Unfortunately, the resounding 
defeat witnessed in this not-so-spe-
cial election means that all we have 
to look forward to now is a new 
round of painful cuts, massive layoffs 
and the sinking feeling that results 
from being hurtled decisively back to 
square one.  

Worst of all, California’s seem-
ingly perpetual budget drama means 
even less state funding for our cash-
starved public universities next year. 
The University of California is fac-

ing at least $320 million in cuts for 
the 2009-10 fiscal year, cuts that UC 
President Mark G. Yudof said will 
lead to larger class sizes, the inevi-
table onset of additional student-fee 
increases and a significant reduction 
in student services. 

The problem lies deep within 
California’s budgetary underpinnings. 
Right now, our state depends on vol-
atile income taxes to provide over 
half of its annual revenue. There is 
little doubt that we need a more solid, 
more reliable, more consistent plan 
on which to base our economy. We 
need a regular source of income, one 
that doesn’t falter under hazardous 
national economic woes or depend on 
the shady wheelings and dealings of 
an unregulated financial sector. 

It may be time now to consider a 
more immediate solution, one that 
will generate cash for our state when 
we need it most. It may be time to 

consider marijuana. 
Before we get caught up in all 

kinds of stilted stereotypes, let’s do 
ourselves a favor and forget the goofy 
“legalize it” campaigns, the dread-
locked demonstrators and the age-old 
“it’s totally harmless” mantra. 

Instead, let’s think of it like corn. 
Or potatoes. Or tobacco. Or just 
about any other lucrative cash crop 
that generates millions of dollars each 
year for the states fortunate enough to 
harvest these valuable commodities. 

The undeniable fact is that mari-
juana has the potential to dramatical-
ly boost our state economy. It repre-
sents a market that consistently rakes 
in billions of dollars each year. The 
demand is there, and what’s more: 
The infrastructure is already largely 
in place. Expansive pot farms con-
sume vast tracts of land in California’s 
northern regions — farms that look 
ripe for government support and reg-

ulation — and the controversial can-
nabis clubs that continue to spring up 
statewide could easily be converted 
to dispensaries geared toward main-
stream consumption. 

With a national economy that has 
rapidly come to value services over 
production, it would be refreshing 
to see California foster a more tradi-
tional, agricultural-based approach to 
generating revenue. And with a bud-
get situation that seriously threatens 
to derail our state’s ability to provide 
for its citizens, it is necessary to con-
sider new approaches to resolving 
this fiscal conundrum.

After last year’s notorious let-down, the Sun God Festival of legend was back in almost full 
force last Friday in nearly every corner 
of campus. Classrooms were empty, 
topless girls were storming the water 
slide, fire was going down in hoops 
and swallows in the Midway Tent and 
rolls upon rolls of toilet paper were 
flying over a crowd of sweaty, moshing 
students in the Dance Tent worship-
ping the mighty Girl Talk. 

Although this year’s festival was 
— like last year — officially confined 
to RIMAC Field, the A.S. Concerts 
and Events Office deserves our sin-
cerest thanks for throwing the party 
of the year, even if it meant sucking 
up additional activity fees and adopt-
ing a fun-in-the-sun aesthetic danger-
ously identical to Coachella’s. But hey 
— Coachella is awesome. Especially 
when it’s free, two minutes from your 
dorm and you get to see the curve-
setter in your chemistry class dancing 
on stage in a headdress and loincloth.

Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Garrett Berg had 
an entire university’s worth of knives 
to his throat, under immense pressure 
from the student body to bring the 
all-out debauchery back while simul-
taneously ensuring administrators 
they wouldn’t be left with thousands of 
dollars in fountain repairs and angry 
parental lawsuits come morning after. 
But with a few key changes — includ-
ing unlimited in-and-out privileges 
and a lineup hot enough to motivate 
us over to RIMAC instead of passing 
out on the nearest grassy knoll — Berg 
and his office pumped out a festival 
that may not have been the uncaged 
T.I. landmark we’ll tell our grandchil-
dren about, but came damn close and 

kept the police report under a novel in 
the meantime.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta vows 
he’ll work with individual college 
councils to sponsor smaller events 
like barbecues on the day of the fes-
tival next year, and bring student-org 
booths back to Library Walk (though 
he’s mysteriously dropped all that big 
talk of a day-of A.S. Bear Garden).

Only time will tell if administra-
tors are capable of the miraculous 
change of heart Gupta will need to 
inspire in order to pull off such a 
large-scale plan. But in any case, 
it looks as if the days of various 
booths, stages and activities spread 
over Sun God Lawn and down to 
Price Center are probably not going 
to return in our day. That’s not to say 
that Concerts and Events shouldn’t 
build slowly and mischievously upon 

the suc-
c e s s f u l 
festival format 
Berg and his team drew 
up for 2009 to mold the festival back 
into a campuswide affair. Though 
Student Center shenanigans saw a 
satisfactorily low level of regulation 
and the Koala never got their hose 
kinked for more than a few minutes 
(and the editorial board got lucky 
and found an opportune hose ready 
for the spraying in Price Center 
Fountain), the UCSD campus as a 
whole was depressingly deserted — 
in no small part thanks to that ridic-
ulous wristband line.

Concerts and Events should 
streamline the wristband chore by 
employing multiple pickup locations 
and increasing the number of lanes at 
each station — and we should all do 

our sneaky part in ensur-
ing that Sun God only gets 

better from here.

can reduce the need for water and 
pesticides.

And compost has also been sci-
entifically proven to suppress plant 
diseases and pests, reduce or elimi-
nate the need for chemical fertil-
izers and produce higher yields of 
agricultural crops.

Since that half-eaten personal 
pizza you trash from Sierra Summit 
is relatively clean (you were the one 
eating it after all) and biodegrad-
able, throwing leftover food scraps 
in landfills is a waste of space. Not 
to mention, discarded grub tends to 
generate methane (a potent green-
house gas) while decomposing in 
a landfill, but doesn’t do so in a 
compost bin.

By diverting waste, we can ease the 
strain on the nearby Miramar landfill 
and return nutrients to the land. 

Even if you’re not using com-
posted soil, public agencies use it to 
landscape parks, recreational areas 
and public property, and to clean 
up contaminated or eroded areas. If 
you’re composting at home, you can 
use your waste to enrich your garden.

A student group named the 
Compost Team has heeded the call 
of environmental stewardship and 
created a model of onsite compost-
ing here at UCSD.

Every weekday evening, several 
students arrive at Sierra Summit and 
truck the leftover vegetable scraps 
from meal preparations over to their 
compost site, which is located in 
a bamboo-fenced area next to the 
UCSD Challenge Course.

The setup includes several shov-
els, a few tumblers (raised drums for 
composting) and piles of decompos-
ing matter. Students then unload 
the food scraps, combine them with 
mulch and cover the mixture with 
a tarp. Hungry microorganisms do 
the rest.

So why don’t Compost Team 
members pick up the scraps in all 
dining-hall bins?

Considering that they already 
have a daily haul of 100 pounds 
of vegetable and fruit scraps from 
Sierra Summit’s kitchen and 50 to 
60 pounds from the Faculty Club, 
there simply isn’t enough manpower 
to accommodate our waste.

It makes more sense to obtain a 
permit and haul the compost to an 
industrial off-campus site. It would 
be great to eventually have an on-
campus composting site that could 
accommodate all of our food waste, 
but until we have enough man-
power, the Compost Team will have 
to make an impact by educating 
students.

Because the best composter 
is an informed one, student-run 
grassroots movements are valu-
able. Simply providing bins without 
informing students as to why they’re 
composting will only get our uni-
versity so far.

Collaboration between the stu-
dents and the university will make 
campus composting a reality, but 
progress starts with us.

Dining halls are providing the 
tools, but the students are the ones 
who need to have the proper mind-
set for composting to work.

By understanding how to com-
post, we can get over the unsightly 
issue of solid waste and gain a sense 
of environmental stewardship.

Composting fits into the idea of 
recycling, but also takes a step fur-
ther because the product of this pro-
cess can be directly beneficial to us.

Contrary to the out-of-sight, 
out-of-mind philosophy, an under-
standing of composting promotes 
awareness of organic wastes as 
potential resources rather than just 
as something gross to be thrown 
away and forgotten. 

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
In response to Michelle Chin’s 

“Exit Fees Won’t Fly,” we, as stu-
dent co-chairs of the All-Campus 
Graduation Celebration, would like 
to address a few concerns. Chin left a 
few elements out of the story, includ-
ing the fact that a 7 percent par-
ticipation rate at last year’s event was 
largely due to a last-minute cancella-
tion by our keynote speaker, Robert 
F. Kennedy Jr. 

The organizing committee is sen-
sitive to event costs, making efforts to 
book a well-known alumni speaker 
who is not charging a fee and using 
money left over from last year to fund 
the event. 

The idea for ACGC was origi-
nated by students. Because of student 
input, it was recommended in the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction Committee (USES) 
report. 

This year, we expect nearly 3,000 
graduating seniors, their families 
and friends to enjoy the festivities 
at ACGC, including a wine and 
cheese pre-reception, a short pro-
gram featuring our keynote speak-
er and 1985 alumnus Mike Judge  
of “Office Space” and “King of the 
Hill” fame, and a post-reception with 
food, drinks, a performance by Lady 
Dottie and the Diamonds and fare-
well fireworks. None of these things 
were mentioned in the op-ed in last 
Monday’s issue of the Guardian. 

We hope that all seniors will take 
this opportunity to celebrate their 

achievements at the event. ACGC 
will take place on June 12, at RIMAC 
Field from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tickets are 
available at the box office, FREE for 
graduating seniors and $10 for guests.

M aybe there’s a reason why Em’s been looking more and more like a butch lesbian in the tabloids — he’s actually his mom. At least, that’s what he claims on 
“My Mom,” a tribute to painkiller addiction in standard 
Mathers sing-song: “Because my mom loved Valium and 
lots of drugs/ That’s why I’m on what I’m on ’cause I’m 
my mom.” Relapse, the celebrity-roasting rapper’s first 
album in nearly half a decade, is coated in similar pill-
popping cheekiness — an evaluation of his recent disap-
pearance into drugs, alcohol and cellulite. The result is a 
mashup of the expected (“Hannah Montana” masturba-
tion, chainsawing dicks off, Dre’s huger-than-life beats) 
and the unexpected: a sober, almost grown-up criticism 
of therapy and self-destruction.

E ven when he’s mouthing off at other emcees, Cam’ron’s inner poet is only mildly radical. Squeezed between subpar tracks and sloppy skits 
on brand-new album Crime Pays, “Get It in Ohio” 
features the Dipset don rapping at sloth speed about all 
things criminal and vaguely cryptic, behind an ama-
teur hook that serenades a batch of narcotics bought 
in Ohio (which he rhymes with a mispronounced 
“gyro”). Then Cam cuts to the rest of his 23-piece with 
a BB-gun beat rattling in the background every time. 
It’s been three years and four public beefs since Cam 
has won time on the airwaves (“Oh Boy,” “Hey Ma”). 
Seems baby’s teeth need more time to grow, ’cause not 
much has changed for rap’s resident sourpuss.

T he Guru’s back, kids, but you’ll hardly recognize him in his Lil Wayne costume. In 2009 the classic emcee returned on 
Jazzmatazz Vol. 5 — er, Guru 8.0: Lost & Found. 
And with the album’s first single “Fastlane” he’s 
throwing a blatant dart toward the pop charts, 
with hollow, trashy percussion, a humdrum 
synthesizer sample and (surprise!) an auto-
tuned chorus: “Sometimes you gotta take the 
fast lane/ Or else they gonna pass you in the fast 
lane/ See I be in the first and the last lane/ Be 
careful when you dippin’ in yo’ cash mayn.” This 
has got to be some kind of joke. Did you lose 
Primo’s number or something?

F ew comedians (besides maybe Jon Stewart) can really pull off that thing where they stare at you after saying something slightly outland-
ish, then shift a little and stare at you some more, 
unafraid, for too long — and that’s the entire punch 
line. But grumpy lesbo-next-door Tig Notaro pulls 
off the artfully awkward silence like a pro, equipped 
with a worried brow, hard jaw and hobbity shag 
(resembling, in her own words, “somewhere between 
Bruce Jenner and Baby Suri”), only breaking out the 
killer dimples when the second wave of laughter 
didn’t echo just right.

Take this gem:
“I was walking through my neighborhood, I was 

walking down the sidewalk, and I was passing this 
guy. And right when we passed each other, he said to 
me, ‘Ah. Them are little titties. I thought you was a 
man.’ And it’s like, OK. OK if you think that. And OK 
if you say that — to yourself. But that thought had to 
go through several layers of filters in his mind. And a 
checklist. And he still decided, ‘Yeah, I’m gonna need 
to say this.’ Like, think of all the things he decided 
not to say. Things like, ‘Good afternoon.’ Or, um, 
‘Oh — I was gonna say something, but I decided not 
to.’ Nope. He went with, ‘Ah. Them are little titties. I 
thought you was a man.’”

Believe me — it’ll be a lot better with the awk-
ward silence.

A t first handshake, he’s the ideal son-in-law: heartbreakingly polite, with a nice egg-like Euro noggin that’d look damn 
cute on the grandkids, a sharp whistle for emer-
gencies and a back-pocket ukulele to entertain 
the extended family after dinner. 

But Jens Lekman is the first to admit he’s a 
disaster in disguise. He graffittied dirty words 
on your old man’s Mercedes (“You Are the 
Light”) and got frisky in the guest bedroom 
(“The Cold Swedish Winter”) on 2004’s When 
I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog. He convinced 
you to run away from your frigid “mummy” of 
a mommy on between-album EP USA October 
2005, then faked being your boyfriend alto-
gether to protect your parents from finding out 
about your girlfriend (“A Postcard to Nina”) on 
2007’s Night Falls Over Kortedala.

Few pasty Swedes have the oomph in their 
twee to nudge me into leaving home for a pre-
mature old age of holding hands and listening to 
each other’s weird dreams on the seashore. But 
despite a pukeload of winter-wonderland acous-
tics and one heck of an unhealthy addiction to 
puppy love, Lekman’s got the teeth to sink his 
shameless pursuit. The pearly, shivering “Sweet 

Summer’s Night on Hammer Hill” — standout 
track on standout 2007 odds-and-ends LP Oh 
You’re So Silent Jens — skips out on the big game 
to make an evening of rolling down Poppy Hill, 
getting all dewy in Shangri La distressed-girl 
choruses and knocking down the drunk march-
ing band on its way home, landing in one giant 
heap of cymbals and giggly clarinet geeks. 

Lekman’s vocal harpsichords pluck them-
selves without relief, seldom evolving from 
puberty’s tremble or the verge of tears, and his 
never-ending flipbook of anecdotes is enough 
to put angry spirals in our eyes and exclamatory 
symbols in the thunderclouds overhead. Not 
to mention those fucking finger snaps, which 
could be a form of friendly Scandinavian torture 
if stripped of the rest of Lekman’s distracting 
tinks and jangles.

But for one small and amorous Tuesday 
night, his no-shame sermon will be just enough 
to bring your own gawky sweetheart to sleeve. 
Hey, he offered from the get-go: “If you ever 
need a stranger/ To sing at your wedding/ A 
last-minute choice/ Then I am your man.”

Jens Lekman will perform live with Tig 
Notaro May 26 at the Loft.

L ately, I’ve been interested in the notion of perceived real-ity: the idea that the world 
one person envisions is innately 
different from everyone else’s. As 
opposed to physical or social reali-
ties, perceived ones are unique to 
the individual — that is, despite 
our existence and presence in a 
collective, physical world, we’re 
also attached to personal fantasy 
in some way, fantasies that can dic-
tate the direction of our lives. It’s a 
testament to the mind’s power of 
conviction: If you believe long and 
hard enough that something is real, 
then it becomes real. 

Despite our interpretations of 
the world, though, we’re still per-
manently confined to our physical 
limitations; our physical and social 
worlds are just as important as our 
perceptive ones. In fact, the har-
mony among said realities is what 
keeps us balanced and stable. So 
what about virtual realities?

The notion of a virtual real-
ity is a contemporary phenom-
enon, and many great minds have 
since explored its equal poten-
tial for beauty and horror. If you 
could do anything or be anyone 
you wanted, why shouldn’t you? 
Certainly, if you’re allowed to do 
something you normally can’t, then 
you should do it. As technology 
rapidly progresses, virtual realities 
are increasingly a part of our actual 
reality, and the questions regarding 
their simulated similarities have all 
but subsided. 

I suppose I should clarify what 
I believe distinguishes virtual real-
ity from virtual space: The latter is 
an environment wherein the dis-
tinction between the virtual and 
physical is constantly, consciously 
known. 

Video games occupy virtual 
space. We, as players, are conscious 
that the character we’re control-
ling is fabricated and distinctive 
from our own beings. In fact, the 
difference between a good game 
and a great one is how well the 
game allows us to empathize with 
a specified character (a distinction 
not just limited to video games). 

Unlike video games, virtual 
realities blur the line between 
avatar and self; the characters we 
control become an extension of 
who we are. Essentially, everything 
we’d normally do on a day-to-day 
basis is instead carried out in a 
virtual environment. We’re sow-
ing the seeds of true virtual real-
ity in the massively popular multi-
player online games out today, the 
most recognizable being World of 
Warcraft.

While one could argue against 
the social ramifications of WoW 
— during in the game’s five years 
of existence, more than one person 
has certainly done so — I’d like to 
focus instead on its unique balanc-
ing act between virtual space and

AVANT-GARDE COMPOSER INSPIRES SILENT SONGBOOK FOR NEW MUSIC CENTER
By Allie Cuerdo
Associate Hiatus Editor

I s the sound a blessing?” John Cage asked in 1966. UCSD’s still kicking around the thought, courtesy of the Conrad Prebys Music Center and its (almost) unholy acoustics. Known also as God in the music department (and a comrade of Steven Schick), Cage 
made a name with uber-experimental music trips on jazz, noise and the quintessential 
“what if.” Zen-inspired chance composing fuels a radical cacophony of life’s ever-present 
blips, beeps and rushing distortion. On his controversial claim to fame, “4’33”,” the weird-
ness all clicks: The silence-shattering piece has been performed all over the world, and 
countless times at UCSD. On camera, it’s truly contemporary — a full orchestra and con-
ductor, armed with four minutes and 33 seconds of blank white pages. So how silent is 
silence? Guess we’ll hear it out. John Cage Songbook will be performed live at Conrad Prebys 
Music Center on May 21 at 2:57 p.m.

The Virgins

The Virgins’ debut album cover is painted in a rainbow of amorphous, 
gummy blobs — a metaphor, no doubt, for their raunchy instapop: sticky 
pleasure bombs that lose most of their flavor by the third play. Lead singer/
songwriter Donald Cumming grew up in a SoHo liquor store, and fast became a 
club kid snorting ’80s new wave; the same giddiness infects their punkish tribute 
to Velvet and Strokes, peaking prematurely on songs like “She’s Expensive” but 
providing a sweet sugar rush to drown out your pre-finals angst. (SM)

Jo Whaley: Theater of Insects

Layering Annie Leibovitz’s penchant for portrait backdrops with National 
Geographic’s love of arthropods, Jo Whaley’s exhibit is a mixture of insects and 
aesthetics. By interspacing 40 staged photos among a collection of the actual 
bugs entombed in glass cases, the Museum of Photographic Arts is bringing all 
of Balboa Park into one room — making natural history art with a tribute to the 
world’s most distinct and diverse creatures. (EG)

Manchester Orchestra

Though their name might suggest a Mandeville nooner, we’d be hard-
pressed if Manchester Orchestra knew Stravinsky from Scarlatti. That doesn’t 
mean the Atlanta-based indie kids are any less prodigious — last month’s 
sophomore opus Mean Everything to Nothing wielded existential loathing and 
quarter-life crisis, breaking into howls that could shatter the thickest stained 
glass: “I felt the Lord begin/ To peel off all my skin.” Hark the angels. (SM)

IT’S BACK, AND IT CAN’T BE REASONED WITH 

FRANCHISE FOURTH SPLITS ITS SEAMS IN A RAGE OF SUMMER ’ROIDS

By Michael Tang
Staff Writer

W ith a hefty $200 million budget, the fourth install-ment of the “Terminator” series gets a serious dose of testosterone-driven special effects, a vast ensemble 
of exotic planes and vehicles and, most importantly, a star-
studded cast. The only downside is that not even Christian 
Bale’s grease-combed hair and husky growl (borrowed from 
his “Dark Knight” days) could pull “Salvation” out of action-
junky excrement.

In the year 2018, Los Angeles lies in a smoky haze (appar-
ently, not much changes in nine years), where the only 
remains of human ingenuity are buried in the charred rub-
ble. Teenage resistance soldier Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) 
has just rescued a wandering stranger — Marcus Wright 
(Sam Worthington) — from a Skynet robot by severing a 
knot of steel drainage pipes and incapacitating the once-
menacing juggernaut.

John Connor (Bale), savior of the nearing Armageddon, 
heads humanity’s ongoing battle against the future’s totali-
tarian killing machines. In other words, director McG 
(“Charlie’s Angels,” “We Are Marshall”) is sprinkling a bit 
of spice on a two-decade-old franchise that audiences were 
led to believe would do for Warner Bros. what J.J. Abrams’ 
“Star Trek” did for Paramount.

Instead, we’re left with a predictable package of explo-

sive sequences — so explosive, in fact, that one of the 
film’s special-effects technicians actually lost a leg during 
production.

“I need to find who did this to me, and so do you,” barks 
Wright as Connor threateningly holds a 9mm pistol to his 
skull. Mockable one-liners are a bountiful commodity in 
“Terminator,” not to the disappointment of die-hard fans 
of the original trilogy. And to give credit where it’s due, 
Worthington delivers a stunning performance as Wright, 
Spartan-built with the heart of a teddy bear.

Number four simply wouldn’t be complete without a 
guest appearance from California’s very own governator — 
even if he looks 10 years younger and injected with Botox, 
thanks to a stunt double and some facial CGI.

What ensues under the auspices of McG and Bale — 
who was actively involved in pre- and postproduction — is 
two hours of eye candy for technophiles, and misdirected, 
oft-campy lines for connoisseurs of bad theater.

“The most important thing we can do right now is stay 
alive, both here [points to the head] and here [points to 
the heart],” Reese asserts when he finds himself trapped in 
the cage of a human transport bound for Skynet Central. 
Similarly, audiences will have to turn off this [points to 
the head] and get a transplant from a prepubescent fanboy 
here [points to the heart] to find “Salvation” anything 
beyond Warner Bros.’ attempt to cash in on the summer-
thriller trend.

Green Day
■ 21st Century Breakdown
REPRISE

A lien” and “Aliens.” “The Godfather” and “Part II.” American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown. In all these, the sequel was just as mind-blowing as the 
original. 

And that’s no small feat. Five years since Idiot 
spawned five singles and sold 14 million copies, 
Breakdown continues the rock-opera trend with an 
18-track masterwork broken into three separate acts 
that topped global sales on opening day. Narrating a 
young couple’s struggle with post-Bush chaos, Green 
Day throws a politicized punch straight at the Man — 
taking punk rock back to total sonic fury.

Act I: Heroes and Cons tiptoes over a few simple 
piano keys before Billie Joe Armstrong erupts into a 
full-on yell. Strap yourself in. The epic title track alter-
nates between grandiose misery and cymbal-crashing 
rants. 

“Before the Lobotomy” is supercharged with a 
pounding riff and even-handed vocals; stir in Green 
Day’s classic stew of self-belittlement and apathy — “I’m 
not stoned, I’m just fucked up/ I got so high I can’t stand 
up” — and “Lobotomy” rises into the album’s punk peak.

With “East Jesus Nowhere,” Green Day rolls out Act 

II: Charlatans and Saints. The single exchanges Idiot’s 
penchant for distortion, vicious condemnation and 
catchy pop choruses for ripened rage. Oddly enough, 
it works this time — Breakdown seethes with an eager 
rebellion that doesn’t feel as forced or commercial as 
previous efforts. 

Act III: Horseshoes and Handgrenades ends on 
“See the Light,” when a triumphant, major-key piano 
climaxes at present day: Obama’s just been elected, and 
the long night of rioting against the Bush administration 
is over. Mob violence settles into wary optimism, edging 
just short of petulant political whine.

It’s too bad the fire can only burn so long. Near the end 
of the 70-minute showstopper, rioters sink into the crowd 
and the last couple tracks grow repetitive, the same four 
chords beaten to shit in true punk tradition. 

Between Idiot and Breakdown, there’s enough hard-
edged anthems to satisfy both the anarchists and politi-
cos. Hey, Armstrong: Keep putting out albums like this, 
and we might even forgive the guyliner.

virtual reality. Is WoW a video game, or a gateway to 
blurring what’s real and important in our lives?

On paper, WoW has every characteristic of a video 
game: an environment to explore, a character to con-
trol, a story to follow and goals to 
accomplish. But WoW doesn’t allow 
for the same level of empathy that 
most games offer; it doesn’t stand 
out as a legitimate form of art. We 
can’t, for example, cry for our stock 
characters. 

But I suppose it’s unfair to judge 
WoW on those merits, since that’s 
not what it was designed to be. If 
anything, the game was designed as 
a cash cow. Activision Blizzard, the 
company behind the game, essen-
tially aimed to create an alternate 
world where we could say and do 
anything we wanted for a low monthly fee. 

Or, in other words, a virtual reality.
One of the most crucial distinctions between a 

regular game and virtual reality is all but lost in WoW: 
the conscious separation between avatar and self. Most 
players become so absorbed in role-playing that their 
avatars become an extension of their identities.

But a chosen few fall headfirst. I mean, we all know 
people who play WoW a little too 
much, right? From their perspec-
tive, they’re just having a grand 
ol’ time — in ours, it’s like WoW 
is steadily taking over their entire 
lives. Our physical relationship 
to these people convinces us that 
what they’re doing is abnormal. 
But to them, playing WoW is as 
every bit as normal as going to the 
bathroom. It’s a lot like substance 
addiction. 

But what happens if everyone 
becomes addicted to the same 
thing? If we all became hooked 

on the same virtual reality, would it come to constitute 
“normal” reality? If it does, then maybe video game isn’t 
as appropriate a term.

FRAYED PLOTLINES TANGLE BLOGGERS’ PARADISE 

By Jenna Brogan
Staff Writer

T hough the idea of an online lie that catches fire in “Adoration” is novel enough to spike interest, it doesn’t take long before the drama dissipates into 
an exhausting catalog of fragmented thoughts. Veteran 
writer/director/producer Atom Egoyan, who braided a 
seamless character weave in 1997’s “The Sweet Hereafter,” 
attempts to tie an artsy bow around his latest schizo-
phrenic mess. Unfortunately, it appears that at some point 
in the last decade, Egoyan broke his 
nimble fingers. 

In his newest take on coming 
of age in the information era, the 
filmmaker asks his audience to 
sit through a disorienting barrage 
of snapshot storylines, flashbacks 
and present-day narratives, blur-
ring the line between reality and 
his own imagination. 

The plotline is meaty enough: A French teacher 
(Arsinee Khanjian) instructs her class to translate a news 
article about a terrorist who plants explosives in the lug-
gage of his pregnant girlfriend. However, Egoyan’s eyes 
are bigger than his stomach, and the director bites off 
more than he can chew in a film just short of two hours. 

The assignment has an especially life-altering impact 
on one student, Simon (Devon Bostick), who was 
orphaned as a child when his father crashed the family 
car. Forever haunted by the mystery of whether the crash 
was intentional, Simon inserts his own history into the 
article, pretending his father was a terrorist behind the 
wheel.  

With the surprising encouragement of his teacher, 
the help of a nifty aluminum MacBook and a 36-person 
video chat, word of Simon’s (fabricated) life story spreads 

like H1N1. 
Within the sanctum of online forums — where teens 

spout stilted philosohies faster than “Dawson’s Creek”  — 
lies the film’s main theme: the impact of technology on 
human identity. 

But talking heads tend to be more obnoxious than 
enlightening, arguinig over the validity of Simon’s story, 
the meaning of life, martyrdom and post-9/11 terrorism, 
among other things. 

And the sermon doesn’t end there. 
Simon’s expanding alternate reality and digital path 

to self-discovery are juxtaposed 
with an unlikely relationship 
between his uncle/guardian (Scott 
Speedman) and a mysterious 
woman masked in medallions and 
draped in a burqa. 

Determined to pump spiritual-
ity into an already overinflated 
film, Egoyan depicts tension 
between the mismatched couple 

by sparking a caustic series of bite-sized religious debates.
That’s one of the film’s crucial missteps — its several 

disconnected plotlines occur all at once. In one blink, 
Simon is living within his terrorist fantasy. In another, 
he’s attempting to untangle his true family history. Still 
another revolves around his uncle, an introspective tow-
truck driver with a fixed squint. An eerie violin drifting 
in and out of the tri-narrative serves as the only harmo-
nizing backdrop to Egoyan’s characteristic surrealism. 

Though the audience is largely abandoned as Simon’s 
two-hour search for meaning unfolds, the arduous jour-
ney is half compensated by mesmerizing cinematogra-
phy that sustains Egoyan’s dreamlike virtual world. 

But instead of igniting thoughtful discussion, lack of 
focus and fluidity make “Adoration” into nothing more 
than a bizarre study in filmic microblogging.

accepted to UCSD, and tried out 
as a walk on for the team. Two-
hundred-and-seven goals and a 
UCSD single season scoring record 
later, Sanders said he is happy that 
he gave Gstettenbauer the opportu-
nity to try out and develop into the 
amazing athlete she proved to be.

When making the decision to try 
out, Gstettenbauer knew she would 
have to give up her beloved posi-
tion as two-meter defender, since 
her tall, skinny frame would not be 
suited as well to manning up against 
college-level opponents. She quick-
ly converted to driver, a position 
more akin to scoring, but never lost 
her defensive roots, becoming the 
team’s strongest perimeter defend-
er and leading the team in steals. 
Gstettenbauer said she has enjoyed 
her run to the top the Tritons’ scor-
ing books and the camaraderie that 
her team always provided, and does 
not look forward to leaving.

With graduation approaching, 
Gstettenbauer said she has no solid 
plans.

“I want to take a year off before I 
do anything and just try to get a job 
somewhere,” she said. “I’ll probably 
be working at the pool as a lifeguard 
until September.”

If nothing else, Gstettenbauer 
said she hopes to continue playing 
water polo through a club in San 
Diego, and maybe even become an 
assistant coach for her former team. 
Ultimately, she hopes to travel and 
play water polo abroad, but she has 
no definitive destination in mind 
and will accept anything the road 
before her presents.

full scholarship programs,” Salerno said. 
“Th e probability of getting one or two 
athletes here [to nationals] isn’t great, so 
we’re defi nitely ahead of the curve.”

Reigning national champion — 
and school-record holder  — senior 
Linda Rainwater will look to repeat as 
champion in the heptathlon and will 
also compete in the high jump for the 
Tritons. 

Th e Tritons’ other top seed is junior 
Danielle Th u, whose school-record 
mark of 57.76 meters in the hammer 
throw is best in the nation this year. 
Th u was named West Region Field 
Athlete of the Year earlier this week. 

Sophomore Bre Schofi eld will

seventh aft er running a school-record 
time of 4:29.6 in the 1,500 meter.

On the men’s side, CCAA Freshman

201’3” at the Occidental Invitational. 
Fellow school record holder junior

Th e trade of Iverson for Chauncey 
Billups gave Denver a leader, a more 
fl uid off ense and a guy who is almost 
as ugly as Sam Cassel, which can come 
in handy when you’re going out late at 
night in Colorado. Furthermore, the 
trade opened up more opportunities 
for J.R. Smith, Nene, Kenyon Martin 
and the incredible Chris “Birdman” 
Anderson, who have all made strong 
contributions in the paint following 
Marcus Camby’s dumping. Th e 
Lakers gave nearly everyone in L.A. 
an ulcer when their series with the 
Rockets went to seven games despite 
the loss of Yao Ming. However, just as 
quickly as everyone forgot about how 
Kobe used to get booed in Denver 
mercilessly because of his previous 
Rocky Mountain legal troubles, 

Lakers fans dismissed any concern 
and proclaimed they never worried 
about that series outcome. Aft er a 
clutch game-one win — including a 
Pippen-esque play by Trevor Ariza 
that cemented his status with Derek 
Fisher as the savviest players on the 
entire Lakers roster — the team and 
city are feeling overly confi dent. And 
that’s always a bad thing. Except that 
the Nuggets, the only team that even 
noted badasses like Chuck Norris, 
Jack Bauer, Vince from Sham-Wow 
and Pootie Tang would fear, feed off  
any sense of self-doubt. With focus, 
the Lakers should be able to beat the 
Nuggets like a red-headed stepchild, 
but as any ginger-killer can attest, 
those soulless bastards always have a 
way of sneaking up on you.

Joe goes with: Lakers in six.

The first two rounds of the NBA playoffs produced the most exciting first-round series of 
all time in the epic Bulls vs. Celtics 
clash, but two second-round series 
went to game seven before ending anti-
climactically. With the favorite squad 
from each conference still remaining, 
as well as two upstart squads that 
haven’t made it this far in the playoffs 
in recent memory, it might be hard 
to predict what will happen in the 
conference championships. Actually, 
it’s not, and everyone can see we’re 
destined for the Lakers vs. Cavaliers in 
the finals. But before the Kobe Bryant/
LeBron James hype-machines go into 
overdrive for that final clash, let’s take 
some time to talk about the two teams 
they’re going to beat on their way to the 
NBA Finals.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Orlando Magic
Dwight Howard is a dominant force 

that looks destined to reign as the NBA’s 
supreme center for the next decade. 
Still, he’s an offensive liability that 
the Magic have proven to play better 
without. That’s not to say that Howard 
should be pulled from the game or that 
the Magic have a better shot if he starts 
throwing elbows or jumping over little 
people and gets suspended. Any games 
the Magic are able to win in this series 
will be because of Howard. The most 
photogenic big man since Gheorghe 
Muresan in “My Giant” can will his 
team to victory, either by commanding 
the post and putting up a huge double-
double or drawing attention that allows 
Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis to 
hit some open threes. Any team with 
“Skip To My Lou” is a sentimental 
favorite for all And-1 fanatics, but 
James took the leap from being just 
the guy nobody could stop, to being 
the guy that nobody could stop and 
the guy that can stop anybody. The 
Magic have a puncher’s chance to make 
this a competitive series, particularly 
since the Cavaliers seemed better 
equipped for the Celtics due to the 
defending champions’ injuries and the 
bloodcurdling anger they bring out 
in anyone who doesn’t smell like feet. 
However, James knows that he is on 
the doorstep of not just a title, but also 
possible history with an undefeated 
playoff run still intact. If Jameer Nelson 
returns to form after injury next season 
and Howard is able to add some type 
of shot that doesn’t actually require his 
hand touching the rim, this team will 
be a contender for years. This just isn’t 
one of those years.

Joe goes with: Cavaliers in four.

Los Angeles Lakers vs. Denver Nuggets
The Nuggets posted the biggest 

victory of the entire postseason in their 
crippling first-round demolition of the 
New Orleans Hornets, delivering the 
entire franchise a giant setback. The fire 
they demonstrated against Dallas — as 
well as the momentum and feeling of 
destiny that still linger after a shot like 
Carmelo Anthony’s game-winning 
basket at the end of game three — 
makes this team far more interesting 
than anyone would have predicted. 
The Nuggets are no longer dealing with 
the unique chemistry issues that come 
with having Allen Iverson on the team.

TRACK & FIELD — With a confer-
ence championship under their belt, 
the Tritons now turn their attention to 
competing against the best athletes in 
the nation. 

Fresh off the California Collegiate 
Athletics Association Championships 
less than two weeks ago, where the 
women’s team won its fifth straight 
title, UCSD will compete at the 2009 
NCAA Division-II Track and Field 
Championships at Angelo State 
University in San Angelo, Texas. 
Nationwide, 620 athletes will participate 
in the event, including 15 Tritons. 
Twelve women and three men will 
represent UCSD, a large number that 
reflects the team’s successful season.

“Every once in a while, women’s  
head coach Darcy [Ahner] and I have 
to do a reality check,” men’s coach Tony 
Salerno said. “We have to appreciate 
how far we’ve come as getting this many 
athletes to nationals is impressive.”

Junior Christine Merrill, senior 
Laiah Blue and sophomore Kelly 
Fogarty will lead the Tritons, each 
qualifying for three events at nationals. 
Merrill, who garnered Athlete of 
the Meet honors at the CCAA 

Championships, will compete in the 
400-meter hurdles and participate 
on the 4x100- and 4x400-meter relay 
teams. Merrill’s time of 58.86 seconds 
in the 400-meter hurdles earned her 
the top seed by over a second. 

Blue will run the 100- and 400-meter 
hurdles, and is also a member of the 
4x100 relay team. Fogarty qualified 
for both the 100- and 200-meter dash 

and is also on the 4x100 team, which 
is seeded sixth in the nation and broke 
UCSD’s record earlier this year.

The Triton women have eight 
returning all-Americans, and will look 
to improve on their best-ever fourth-
place finish from last season.

After four hard-fought years as a Triton, Sydney Gstettenbauer, one of UCSD’s most prolific 
athletes, will receive her diploma and 
leave the team this spring. Following 
her successful career on the women’s 
water polo team, the Ventura, Calif., 
native will graduate with a degree in 
environmental systems. Her gradua-
tion forces the team to make up for 
her tremendous production over the 
past four years.

Gstettenbauer wasn’t always a 
swimmer. As a child, she refused to 
take swim lessons. Finally, she decided 
to hop into the water and start swim-
ming. Still, Gstettenbauer doesn’t clas-
sify herself as a swimmer — only a 
water polo player who is forced to 
swim. 

Gstettenbauer ran track for four 
years before she even heard of water 
polo, and only left the track because 
of tendonitis she developed as a result 
of the high jump. Fortunately for the 
Tritons, a friend told her about water 
polo and she quickly fell in love despite 
her aversion to swimming. Her first 
experience with the sport came from a 
class she took at her local community 
college in eighth grade. She joined a 
club team soon afterward.

When Gstettenbauer played in 
high school, her primary position 
was two-meter defender. It was her 
responsibility to cover the biggest, 
strongest person in the pool and shut 
them out; a responsibility that typi-
cally gets assigned to taller players 
because of their great reach. She loved 
her role on defense, and never desired 
to be a superstar on offense. Through 
the course of her four years in high 
school, she grew more and more 
infatuated with the sport, but never 
developed the same love for swim-
ming, even after her coach instituted 

mandatory swim times for the team.
“I never could make any of those 

swimming times,” Gstettenbauer said 
with a chuckle. “They were instituted 
when I was already on the team, but if 
I hadn’t been on the team at the time, 
I never would have made the team.”

Toward the end of her high-
school career, Gstettenbauer realized 
she might not play water polo in 

college. During the application pro-
cess, Gstettenbauer did not consider 
water polo as a criterion for college, 
but when she heard about UCSD’s 
women’s water polo team, she con-
sidered playing. Even though she was 
never recruited, she contacted head 
coach Larry Sanders when she was
