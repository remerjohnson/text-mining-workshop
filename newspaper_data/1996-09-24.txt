SAN MARCOS, Texas-
Southwest Texas State 
University dormitory residents 
rallied September 18 in protest 
of a proposal passed by the 
University Counci l that would 
allow faculty and staff to park 
in residence hall spaces. More 
than 50 students attended the 
rally, voicing opposition to the 
proposal - which would 
introduce additional traffic to 
the already overcrowded 
student parking lots. One 
student said the proposal may 
endanger student safety by 
forcing dorm residents to hike 
from less-crowded. di stant 
parking lots at night. Students 
also complained about the lack 
of student involvement in the 
decision process.

Associated Students (A.S.) council , the Office 
of the Registrar will issue new tudent identifi-
cation cards with new per onal identification 
(PID) numbers in November. 

The Registrar will alter the student identifi-

"The new student identification system is a 
good idea." Vice hancellor for Enro llment and 
Management/Registrar Richard Backersaid. "I f 
there is any way that we can protect the privacy 
of students, we will do so. This is a major step." 

The new system is the result of an agreement

Officials Say 
Hospital's 
Closure Would 
Be 'Absurd' 
NEGOTIATIONS: UCSD is 
talking with the Scripp and 
Sharp-ColumbiaJHCA group 
By Terry Lew 
News Edi tor 

Despite rumors to the contrary . U SD 
spokeswoman Leslie Franz insists that neither 
the main UCSD medical center in Hillcrest or 
the Thornton Hospital on campus are going to 
close any time soon. 

"That ' s absurd." Franl 'aill last week. "Ru-
mor outnumber facts probably 20 to one." 

The Board of Regents initially autho-
rized U 0 to b gin louking for one or more 
strategic partners at it ' May meeting, after medi-
cal center administrators reported the hospital 
was projecting a $20.3 million loss for the 1996 
fisca l year. 

Discussions have since focused on two pro-
viders as pos ible merger candidates: the non-
profit . six-hospital Scripps group. and the for-
profit Sharp- olumbialHCA Healthcare - the 
largest such group in the nation . 

Neither Scripps nor Sharp officials would 
comment on the state of what Franz tenned 
"exploratory negotiations," but cripps spokes-
woman Sue Pond rom noted that "at thi s poi nt . 
the ball's in their courl." 

"We all agr..:ed ... that it would not be in 
anyone's best interests to discuss anything about 
what we all proposed until UC D has made a 
decision el ther way." added Sharp spokeswoman 
Stephallle Ca 'cnla. 

A 'semblywoman Denise Moreno Ducheny 
(D-National Ci ty) protested the negotiations in 
a letter of protest to Board of Regents Chai rman 
Tirso de l Junco before last week 's meeting. 

Ducheny wrote that the university should 
attempt to find a sys temwide . o lution, "before 
each campus is allowed to give away or se ll off 
these cheri shed public assets ." 

"At the heart of the issue i ' control of a UC 
teaching hospital and community mai nstay by a 
non-academic institution, a precedent-setting 
move that I find deeply troubling," she tated. 

Ducheny also ex pressed her concern wllh 
the lack of both public input and oversight into 
the partnership proce~s. 

"She was concerned becau 'e things were

Governor's Budget Holds No Student Fee Increases 
SURPLUS: UC system 
will receive an addition 
$130 million 
By John Murphy 
Senior Staff Writer 

Governor Pete Wilson signcd the 
1996-97 state budget July IS, assur-
ing California residents aHcnding 
the University of California that 
mandatory student fees will remain 
at $3,700 - not including campus-
specific fees - for the second con-
secutive year and allocating an ad-
ditional $ 130 million in statc gen-
eral funds to the UC ystem. 

The budget also contains provi-
sions to narrow the pay gap between 
UC faculty and the faculty at com-
parable instituti ons, increase the 
amount of financial aid available to 
students from the Cal Grant pro-

gram and prepare the UC for the 
additional enrollment of 1,500 stu-
dents. 

UC President Richard Atkinson 
had high praise for the parlicipants 
in the budget process. 

"This budget i good news for 
th e University of Californi a," 
Atkinson said. ''The governor and 
the legislature have demonstrated a 
who le-hearted eommilm ent to 
higher education and the need to 
safeguard UC quality and access. 
This budget clearly recognizes the 
important role UC plays in a healthy 
Californi a economy." 

The freeze on student fees can be 
allributed to both greater- than -ex-
pected tax revenues caused by the 
improving economy, and an agree-
ment reached last year between the 
governor, the regents and the state 
legislature. The agreement was an

commitment to

and the need to

and access."

University of California 

altemptto maintain current fee lev-
els for the following four years, bar-
ring any signiticant drop in rev-
enues. 

Out of a total Slate hudget of 
$62.8 billion, the UC system will 

receive a total of $2.06 billion, a 6.7 
percent increase over last year, and 
the largesl increase in state spend-
ing on the university during Ihis 
decade. However, total general fund 
expenditures on Ihe uni versity arc 
still less than they were in 1989-90. 

In addition to freezing student 
fees, funds will be used to restore 
faculty pay to leve ls competili ve 
with other top-tier uni versities . All 
university employees will receive a 
2 percent cost-or-li ving wage in-
crease. In addi tion, UC faculty wi II 
recei ve a 3-percent parity adj ust-
ment as part o f a three-year plan 10 
restore faculty pay to competi tive 
leve ls. According to the UC Ofli ce 
or the Presidcnt, this raise wi ll hring 
faculty salal ;;;:s to within .5 percent 
of the average pay found at uni vt;r-
si ties included in a recem UC study. 

The budget also provides $1-2

million in additional funding for UC 
academic outreach programs, as well 
as $ 1 milli on to stren gthen 
California 's bid for one of the two

In addition, the UC will receive

WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT 

THE GOP CONVENTION? 
COMMENTARY: The GOP's bonanza offered little real excitement, 
but its tone signaled a new and woeful t~end in American politics 

Nat e 
PIETILA 

Resident 
Gadfly 

The Republican Party turned 
both San Diego and political hi s-
tory upside down last month 
when it held its quadrennial 
national convention. Thousands 
of delegates, 
journalists 
and support 
personnel 
jammed the 
downtown 
area to par-
ticipate in the 
gigantic 

media event, staged primarily to 
bolster support for the candidacy of

COMMENTARY: Although UCSD does have some drawbacks, by and large it is a pretty good 
place to go to school, at least if students are willing to take advantage of what it has to offer 

COME ON, STUDENTS, HAVE SOME PRIDE 
ByIrMlt .......... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Once again it's time for the 
obligatory "Freshmen, Welcome to 
the University of California, San 
Diego" commentary, lhat will give 
you the in ide scoop on the univer-
sity, detailing the living hell new 
students will experience for the 
next four years . 

Just kidding. Although we at the 
Guardian have in years past pre· 
sented UCSD in Ihis way to every 
fresh new face to grace the campus, 
this year ('II take a different 
approach. "Be true to your school," 
I always say. 

All in all, young scholars, the 
next four years will not be a never-
ending death. Consider: 

• While this campus will never 
be a "happening" place, enough 
student organizations, sporting 
events and TG concerts are avail-
able to help pass the time - when 
you're not studying, that is. 

• Although La Jolla is the

ships that modern families face: 
"For many people my age, our 
dreams and our hopes are no differ-
ent than those of our parents, bUI 
people today are under real pres-
sures, and they are worried ... At the 
end of the day while I'm rocking 
[my daughter] Susan Ruby to sleep, 
I look down and wonder what her 
life will be like. I want the best for 
her." 

Molinari's speech made one of 
the most blatant appeals to emolion. 
She just oozed compassion, care 
and concern. This might have won 
the votes of some parents, but 
should Ihis be the basis of our polit-
ical rhetoric? 

Rep. J.C. Wall S, former 
Oklahoma Sooners quarterback, 
also delivered an impassioned 
address: "I never thought I would 
have the privilege of addressing 
the American people, but this is 
America where dreams still come 
true." Lest anyone think thai char-
acter isn 't an issue in this election: 
"You see, character does count. 
For too long we have gollen by in 
a society that says the only thing 
right is to get by, and the only 
thing wrong i to get \:a ughl. 
Character is doing what 's right 
when nobody is looking." This i 
supposed to help us distinguish 
Republicans from Democrals? 
This is the key 10 the politica l 
issues of our time'! 

Even so remarkable a rhetori -
cian as Jack Kemp had this to olTer 
in his acceptance speech: "Our goal 
is not just a more prosperous 
America but a better Amcri(;a. An 
America thaI reL:ogni zes the infi · 
nite worth of every individual and, 
like the Good hepherd, leaves the

• You'll never experience the 
horror that was Anchorview -
then again, campus food in general 
has never tasted, sounded, smelled, 
appeared or felt good. If you like a 
loo-percent carbohydrate diet, this 
is the place to be. 

• Uh, you can cut class without 
the principal calling your parents. 

OK, so maybe UCSD is a living 
hell - probably because there isn' t 
a lot of pride or passion among stu-
dents at this university. 

But the administration, your 
counselors and your parents will 
still point to everything the campus 
has accomplished over the years 
and ask you to take pride in such 
and such and so and so. 

"Like what?" you ask. 
Well, uh, you know ... 
How about the Stuart 

We have a marble 
drinking fountain 
wHh a hidden 
butlon - and when 
you bend down to 
drink, you're 
actually bowing to 
the administration. 
Collection, the world's grealest 
endeavor to integrate art with the 
environment? We have a marble 
table with willy one-liners carved 

into it, stuck in an abandoned cor-
ner of Muir College where 90 per· 
cent of the student body will never 
ee it. Wc have a marble drinking 

fountain with a hidden button -
and when you bend down to drink, 
you're actually bowing to Ihe 
adminislration. Finally, we have 
one heck of a red shoe running 
around in the woods. 

Neat-O. 
If you're nOl into art for art 's 

sake, then check out the architec· 
ture of Geisel Library or Center 
Hall. Of course, the one thing all 
campus buildings have in common 
is the total dreariness Ihat falls over 
you upon entering one. UCSD 
architecture looks good from the 
outside, but much like the educa-
tion you' ll receive here, the inside 
is completely forgettable. 

Ah, education - did I mention 
that learning is a useless endeavor 
at this campus'! Now. I know 
you've all seen u.s. News and 
World Report informing us Ihat 

UCSD is on it "up and coming" 
list. In any given year, we ' re 
ranked the 22nd-best school in the 
nation, or the 481h, or Ihe 89th or 
whatever that number is. 

The problem is Ihis: If you came 
to this school looking to learn 
something, you're in for a hell of a 
time. Most of your professors 
attended undergraduate and gradu-
ate schools that utilized a semester 
system. Despite knowing that a 10-
week quarter is not enough time to 
do anything but warm up your 
short-term memory, professors try 
to squeeze in as much material as 
they can. 

Furthermore, very few profes-
sors - whom the university hired 
to do research, not teach - have 
what it takes to lead a class. 

But I digress. I'm supposed to 
tell you why you should lake pride 
in this educational institution, why 
you should be true to your school. 

How about sports'! We have

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Tuesd·ay, September 24, 1996 

COMMENTARY: While some forms of political correctness are just too silly to be taken 
seriously, others threaten free thinking and intellectual progress 

"CORRECTNESS" STIFLES FREE EXPRESSION 
By CIwte ScInIber 
Editor In Chief 

College is commonly visualized 
as an environment of academic free-
dom that fosters the open expression 
of ideas and intelieclUal growth. 
However, there are people among us 
who would sacrifice this freedom of 
expression on the altar of the god of 
political correctness. 

Before delving into the problems 
of political correctness, one should 
first look at the term it elf. The best 
definition comes from Webster's 
Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. 
The word "political" means: "adept 
at, sensi tive to, or engrossed in poli-
tics." Hmmm. Not too clear. What 
about the word "politics"'! The best 
definition for that is "the art or sci-
ence of government." 

OK. now what is the definition 
of "correct(-ncss)"? According to 
Mr. Webster, correct means "con-
forming to or agreeing with fa!;t, 
logic, or known truth ." Some syn-
onyms listed are: accurate, exact, 
precise and right. 

Whoa! Hold on a second here. 
When thinking of government or 
JXllitics, the last things that come to 
mind are "logic," "truth" or "cor-
reetnes ." The fact that this contra-
diction 'is so apparent in the 
moniker of this movement shou ld 
be a red nag from the very begin-
ning. 

What exactly are those touting 
"political correctness" hoping to 

accomplish? When talking with 
them, one learns about the goals of 
advancing the cause of diversity and 
de-legitimizing oppressive expres-
sion so that people can feel good 
about themselves. These sound like 
good things - at least until one 
moves out of the group hug long 
enough to actually think about their 
implications. 

At Gcorgetown Law School a 
few years ago, a student wrote an 
article in the school paper that 
decried Georgetown Law's affirma-
tive-action policy, claiming that 
those admiLled under the policy 
might not be intellectually capable 
of competing against those who 
were admi tted without the benefit 
of special consideration. 

He used admissions data from 
Georgetown's records to calculate 
that the average black student at 
Georgetown had a lower LSAT 
score and lower GPA than the aver-
age white student , and then noted 
that there were proportionately 
fewer blacks than whites graduating 
with honors or earning spots on the 
law review. 

In response to this article, there 
was much outrage and gnashing of 
teeth . There was even an attempl lo 
expel the author, a third-year stu-
dent with one semester left Most 
opponents of Ihe article claimed 
that it shouldn't have been wrinen 
or published at all. Those critical of 
the article did nol atlempt to debate 

"f 
,; 

The word 
"antlhistallline" 
needs to become 
"antl-hl./h ...... 
tallllne," lest women 
looking for allergy 
relief feel 
discriminated 
against. 
ils merits, but merely bullied the 
author and terrorized anyone daring 
10 share his point of view. 

The point of this example is not 
to take a stand on what the con-
tentious article claimed, but to 
defend the right of the author to 
express his ideas. If one disagrees 
with an idea. the fight should 
revolve around the content of the 
statement, not whether it was 
expressed in the first place. Trying 
10 suppress an idea with force 
demonstrates a lack of confidence

cessors. 

in any counter-argument. 
Totalitarian regimes resort to force 
to suppress free expression because 
they cannot justify their idea on an 
intellectual level. 

Then , of course, there is the 
Orwellian allemptLO program "cor-
rectness" into our thinking by 
restricting and redefining the very 
words used to express ideas. Ever 
hear Ihe word "herstory"? It is half 
of the supposedly "non-sexist" term 
"history/herstory." The logic behind 
Ihis is that using just the lerm "hi -
tory" institutionalizes discrimina-
tion against women in the field, dS it 
is the composile of the words his 
and story. That seems like a good 
thing, doesn' t it? 

Once again, just a little bit of 
thought and knowledge shows the 
tragedy (or comedy, depending on 
one's view) of this position. In the 
English language, the word history 
come from the Latin histaria, 
which means inquiry. The Latin 
actually carne from the Greek itisror 

.(also iSlOr), which means knowing 
or learned. 

Those cunning, crafly Greeks. 
Those ancient , white males who 
came up with the Greek language 
knew that in 3000 years English 
would be the dominant language on 
the planet, and that by creating the 
word iJislOr they could keep all 
those .pesky females under Ihe 
thumbs of their male brethren. And 
lhose white, male Romans, also in 

on the plot, helped them out by 
keeping the word alive as his/aria. 

What a perfect scheme. Lucky 
all those politically correct types 
outsmarted them and figured it all 
out. 

Actually, the plot probably per-
vades our enlire language structure. 
Knowing the depth to which those 
dead-white-males would stoop to 
ensure future oppression. it 
becomes necessary to re-evaluate 
the whole language. The word 
"antihistamine" needs to become 
"anti-hislhers-tamine," lest women 
looking for allergy relief feel dis-
criminated against. 

And don't forgel the Etruscans. 
The word "histrionics" needs to 
become "hislherstrionics" if those 
nasty Etruseans are to be headed off 
in the pursuit of oppressing women 
in thealrics with their evil male 
word "isler. 

Some forms-of political correct-
ness are a bit scary, and some are 
just plain silly, but in all its forms it 
works against the principle of free 
expression of ideas. Anyone who 
believes that college is lruly a place 
of inlellectual freedom where one 
can benefit and grow due to expo-
sure to di verse ideas and opinions 
should fighl the restrictions on 
ideas wherever they pop up. Ideas 
should be subject to rigorous 
debate, not merely pigeonholed 
away by intimidation, even intimi-
dation wilh good intentions.

manifest itself more than in 
Elizabelh Dole's Oprah Winfrey-
style slroll among the delegates on 
the third night of the convention. 

There she was, interviewing -
not delegates - but members of 
the audience aboul their per~onal 
experiences with Bob Dole and his 
character. Although the whole seg-
ment was scripted. Liddy absolute-
ly wowed the crowd with her con-
fidence. In terms of sheer stage 
presence and personality, Liddy's 
was the best "speech" of the con-
vention. But quiz anyone who saw 
her speech about whal she said, and 
they will draw a blank. 

And that was just the problem 
with the convention: little was said. 
But it would be too quick to say that 
nothing newsworthy happened this 
year at the Republican Convention. 
ABC Nightline anchor Ted Koppel, 
who packed up his show and left 
town alier the second day, realJy 
missed the biggest story of the con-
vention. Gone are the days when 
conventions were bold, brash and 
politically (and publicly) useful 
exercises. Capilulating to popular 
culture, the Republicans have 
ensured that the I-feel-your-pain 
convention is here to stay. 

SCHOOL: 
Continued from page 5 
several champion-caliber Division 
III and club-sport teams here. 
UCSD has dominated certain 
sports for several years, especially 
women's teams in soccer, water 
polo and lennis. Any sporting event 
here is worthy of our attenlion, as il 
is more likely than nOI to be exci t-
ing. 

I can't explain why. people don' t 
go to games. At a school starving 
for something 10 do, you'd think a 
few studenlS would take in a bas-
ketball game. Perhaps Di vision JII 
can't draw a crowd. Perhaps SLU-
dent attending UCSD aren't intei-
ested in watching sports. 

But take my advice - check 
out a game. Any game. Just tear 
yourself away from your precious 
short-term-memory studies and 
give yourself a break. 

If you can't take pride in any of 
the above, perhaps you can get inlo 
sludent organizations. Some are 
pretty worthless - like the 
Associated Students, which likes to 
pass resolutions stating its opposi-
tion to racism (just in case some 
studenls weren't clear on that )nat-
ter). Olhers, like Ihe studenl co-
ops, are more interesting political-
ly, sexually, environmentally, etc. 

Or you can check out the stu-
dent media. Most schools have one, 
maybe two, stude", publications. 
Here, you've got The Koala - a 
humor rag which has seen better 
days. Voz Fronreriza - a quasi-
revolutionary, racist, homophobic 
political mag. and the Last 
Indicator, or New Indicator, or 
whatever they ' re calling it this 
year. 

Then there is the Guardian. 
which swept the Ca lifornia 
Intercollegiate Pres Association'S 
awards for non-daily papers last 
year. De~pite the rumors , snide 
comments and outright lies one 
will read throughout the year, 
despite some inevitable mistakes 
which will Ix: made. Ihe Guardian 
is as close as you' re goi ng 10 gel to 
professional on this campus. 
Perhaps you freshmen can take 
pride in that. 

But you won't. 
This is UCSD, after all.

failed. (Ibe on-target advice I got at 
the time was "quit partying and start 
studying.") 

My advice to incoming freshmen 
is this: You all excelled in high 
school, so it will be scary the first 
time you fail a quiz - especially if 
you have never failed before. Stay 
with it, talk to your colleagues and 
your teachers, and take advantage of 
the tutorials and other aids that are 
here for just thi s purpose. You can 
succeed here, just as you have in the 
past. UCSD can provide you with 
the most exciting leaming opportu-
nity of your life. It can also be great

fun. 

'Illis year I have the good fortune 
to worle: with two experienced stu-
dent leaders, Coleen Sabatini and 
Vicki Mayer. Together, we hope to 
find ways to ensure that the culture 
of UCSD is broadly inclusi ve of stu-
dents and re ponsive to their needs. 
We hope to create a university com-
munity in which students have many 

opportunities to be acti vely engaged 
in the intellectual, social, and athICt-
ic life of the campus. 

We also want UCSD to be an 
environment in which a diversity of 
cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities 
and viewpoints thrive together. A 
university epitomizes the strength 
that comes from such differences. 
UCSD recruits the finest students in 
the country, and by respecting and 
learning from each other we maxi-
mize the potential of each student 
here. 

We believe that the strength of 
the faculty will continue to be the 
single most important determinant 
of UCSD's future. Our ability to 
attract and retain brilliant faculty is 
due in part to the stimulating intel-
lectual environment present at 
UCSD. Students help create this 

environment by getting involved in 
classroom discussions, participating 
in research with faulty, and pursuing 
academic internships. 

We also request your help in rec-
ognizing the valuable contributions 
of our staff. Despite shrinking bud-
gets and growing workloads, our 
staff has demonstrated a generosity 
of spirit and commitment that I thinlc 
is unmatched in the UC system. 
Many of our staff are UCSD alumni, 
and their advice can be extraordinar-
ily beneficial to students. 

Finally, I hope you will help 
build UCSD's "community spirit" 
- that intangible sense that each of 
us is a va lued member of the UCSD 
community and essential to its suc-
cess. Together we can find ways to 
captu re the sense of fami Iy so criti-
cal to the quality of life at UCSD.

UC Berkeley's Tien to Resign 
Mter Six Years as Chancellor 
DEPARTURE: Chang-Lin 
Tien says he wants more time 
for teaching and research 
By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

UC Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien 
announced in July that he will be resigning as 
chancellor, a post he has held since 1990. 

ChancellorTien, the first Asian-American in 
the nation to head a major re-
search university, was 
publically opposed to the sys-
tem-wide repeal of affinnative 
action instiluted by the Board 
of Regents last summer. 

Tien's resignation. 
"The regents never fully appreciated Tien' s 

leadership skills," Davis said. "On some occa-
sions [Tienl was treated downright shabbily . 
Many of my fellow regents need to look in the 
mirror and shoulder some blame for the loss of 
this cherished educator." 

A selection committee composed of five 
members of the Board of Regenls and five 
members of the Berkeley faculty will be advis-
ing President Atkinson on the choice 9f a 

replacement for Chancellor 
Tien. 

The regents who will com-
prise the advisory committee 
are Ward Connerly, John 
Davies, Meredith Khachigian, 
Howard Leach and David Lee. 
Board Chairman Tirso del 
Junco will also serve on the 
committee. 

SlUdent and alumni repre-
sentatives may attend com-
mittee discussions, but will 
not be able to vote. 

During his tenure, Chan-
cellor Tien raised $780 mil-
lion in private donations for 
Berkeley and also instituted 
the Berkeley Pledge program, 
a $1 million outreach program 
that sought to maintain diver-
sity by preparing 
underrepresented minority 
high school students to meet 
UC admission standards. 

Courtesy UC Berkeley 
Resigning: Chang-Lin Tien 

Atkinson will give the 
committee a list of up to 15 
candidates, and the commit-

tee will evaluate each name and then advise 
Atkinson before he submits his top choice to 
the Board of Regents for their approval. 

"We owe Chancellor Tien a tremendous 
debt of gratitude for his many accomplish-
ments which have benefited the Berkeley cam-
pus, the entire university, the state and higher 
education as a whole," said UC President and 
fonner UCSD Chancellor Dick Atkinson. 

Tien indicated that he was resigning the 
chancellorship in order to spend more time 
teaching and doing resean;h in UC Berkeley's 
department of mechanical enginecri ng, as well 
as spending more time with his family . 

However, California Ll. Gov. Gray Davis 

This fall, UC Berkeley and UCLA will both 
be searching for new chancellors. 

UCLA Chancellor Charles Young previ-
ously announced his resignation and set the 
date at June 30, 1997. Chancellor Charles 
Pi ester of UC Santa Cruz stepped down at the 
beginning of the summer. 

• ______________________________ • - said there may have been other motivations for 

All three departing chancellors were critics 
of the Board of Regents' decision last summer 
to repeal affinnative action .

Republican yoice: The message of the Christian Coalition could not be suppressed at a rally 
in Balboa Park. A large turnout of demonstrators came to hear speakers Elizabeth Dole, Dan 
Quayle, Newt Gingrich, and Pat Robertson support the issues at the forefront of the Christian 
Coalition's agenda: abortion, prayer in school, and family values (left) . At the conclusion of the 
convention, the mood was all fun and games. MTV may have been one of the only news stations 
amused, however, and also one of the only news stations present. NBC's Dan Rather and ABC's 
Ted Koppel both packed up and left early, frustrated at what they considered to be tedipus and 
scripted proceedings (top). A departing convention-goer thumbs his nose at protestors as San 
Diego police keep close watch on the crowd (below) . .

MERGER: UCSD demic medical center, it offers some of the most advanced care available. 
wants to save its teaching 
and patient-care missions 

According to Vice Chancellor for Health 
Sciences John Alksne, UCSD would not allow 
a pannership to compromise its teaching and 
patient-care mission. Continued from pac_ 1 

Rotto said. 'There needs to be open discussion 
about the future of the UCSD Medical Center." 

"We will not enter into any agreement that 
does not advance our mission, and both Scripps 
and Sharp have accepted these terms for dis-
cussion," he told the regents at last week's 

According to Franz, 'the amount and level 
of care UCSD provides to indigent patients is 
the main reason the hos-
pital can no longer afford 
to continue with business 
as usual. 

"We have the largest 
percentage of patients in 
our system who are non-
paying, uninsured pa· 
tients," she said. "That 
burden is growing, and we 
can no longer look into 
the future and say we can 
balance our bottom line 
with this." 

"I believe a sound 
case .... been made 
that UCSD should 
seek a strategic 
partner. We received 
a good overview of 
the challenges facing 
UCSD,oftha 
discussions with 
Scripps and Sharp, 
and of the pros and 
cons 0' partnership 
with each 

meeting. 
Regent John Davies, 

chair of the Committee 
on Health Services, said 
he supported the partner-
ship efforts. 

'" believe a sound case

"We received a good 
overview of the chal-
lenges facing UCSD, of 
th e di sc uss ions with

of the pros and cons of

Franz added that the 
di scussions are an attempt 
to "explore whether a part-
nership through Scripps 
or Sharp would providc 
resources and the oppor-
tunity for UCSD to 
strengthen its ability to

UCSD Submits Proposal For New 
National Supercomputing Program 
RESEARCH: Officials 
will visit possible sites 
in October 
By Mary Hlalns 
Associate News Edllor 

The UCSD Center for Advanced 
Computational Science Engineer-
ing (CACSE) ubmitted a proposal 
earlier thi s month to the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) in hopes 
of participating in a new, nation-
wide program. 

In October f 1997, Partnerships 
of Ad vanced Computational Infra-
structure (PACt) will repla(;e the 
current NSF program that funds the 
UCSD-based San Diego 
Supercomputer Center (SDSC) as 
well as other national research inst i-
tutes . 
. PACI is designed to combine 

high-performance computing with 
a broad range of scientilic efforts. 

Under the terms of the UCSD 
proposa l, manage ment o f the 
Supercomputer Center wil l shift 
from General Atomi(;s to UCSD. 

CACSE direc tor Sid Karin, 
iounding director of SDSC and ad-
junct professor of computer science 
and engineering, said Thursday that 
CACSE will "serve as the campus 
home for SDSC" ifUCSD is (;hosen 
to participate in the new program. 

Karin also said he believed 
UCSD was one of on ly six entities 
across the nation to submit a pro-
posal. Thecompetition includes the 

nation 's three other supercomputer 
centers and two un](nown parties. 

Of the groups that submiued pro-
posals, two or three competitors wi II 
be selected to participate in the PAC I 
program. 

If UCSD is one of the sites cho-
sen for the PACI 

According to Dynes, CACSE will 
function in the future as a resource 
for UCSD faculty and students, aim-
ing "at fostering, promoting and de-
veloping computational science and 
engi neering research and education, 
as well as providing advanced com-

program, it will 
be involved in a 
network of part -
nerships with the

occur sometime in March.

Karin says he hopes that CACSE

and the Center for Wireless Com-

all interested faculty members and

Backer, the personal access codes

However, Backersaid that the 
university will continue to use 
the SSN as a "transparent num-
ber" - the university will con-
tinue to use SSNs for financial 
aid and records systems, but it 
wi II not appear on campus docu-
ments. 

Erin Holve, A.S . Commis-

a good idea. •

students more than the [SSN sys-
tcm does]."

UCSD GRAD STUDENT PLAYS BIG ROLE AT CON.VENTION 
By et.t. SchrelHr 
Editor in Chief 

For one week in August , the city of San 
Diego was inundated with celebrities and 
political bigwigs who converged on the ci ty 
for the Republican National Convention. 
While most of these folks left with Dole and 
Kemp, at least one of those well-known 
allendees is still here. In fact, one might even 
be lucky enough to get her as a TA for a lit-
erature class at UCSD. 

Whcn not doing TA work, Rachel 
Campos can be found taking courses in the 
graduate school of International Relations 
and Pacitic Studies. Most people would more 
easily identify the 24-year old Campos as the 
girl from MTV's the "Real World 3" who 
kissed Puck, but she manages to keep a sense 
of humor about events connected with her 
MTVexperience. 

At this summer's Republican National 
Convention Campos had an important role 
within the Young Voter's Program, a series of 
special programs tailored to the 1000 youth 
delegates aged 16-25. Campos was gracious 
enough to discuss her role at the convention 
and a few other topics with the GLlardian this 
past week. 
......... : What w •• your role with

Rachel Campos: I was a national you th 
spoke person with the Young VOler's 
Program. At the '92 convention in Houston, 
the youth were integrated into the main con-
vention. This time, however, there was a 
seperate youth pavillion on the side of the 
convention center with a whole seperate 
"Youth Convention." They brought the 
young people out onto the main Ooor for rul-
lie and support, and for photo ops. 

I was involved with the "Conversations 
With Young America" program. There was an 
MTV-type selling with funky furniture and

lots of colors, and they brought in famous 
senators, congressmen and radio talk-show 
hosts. I interviewed them and then took ques-
tions as a mediator from the Young Voters.

I got to meet Bob Dole in the Green 
Room Ithe convention center dressing area]. 
He randomly came by wh.ile I was in there, 
and I was really slOked to meet him. 

Generally, being on the Ooor was really 
cool, and then there were those really cute 
secret-service guys.

[Young peoplej have the power, but it's 
unlikely that they ' ll get out or the apathetic 
state they seem 10 be in. Senior citizens are 
really active politically, and thai 's why a lot 
of their issues become important. We have

effectively. 
What do you think I. the r ..... that 
lIIIOI'e younc peopI ..... ·t Involved 
In the political process? 

The problem is really two- fold. First , 
young people tend to be a lillie lazy when it 
comes to politics and keeping up with the 
issues. Also, politicians don't seem to take 
youths seriously. 

At the convention, [the Republicansl 
mis cd a golden opportunity as 1000 youths 
were there ready to be involved. Instead, they 
had a pavillion off to the side, away from the 
real convention. An inlelligent person picks 
up on that very quickly. 

[The whole cycle) k.ind of feeds on itself. 
Young people don't care, so politicians don't 
pay attention. Young people pick up on that, 
and then they are even more apathetic. 
WIIat do you think Mould be .... to 
CM "e YOUltC voters Involved? 

I like what MlV i doing. The whole 
"Choose or Lose" campaign is really good. 
But it's really about what parents teach their 
kids at home. Politics was always discussed 
around the dinner table at my house. Really 
thoug.h, I don' t have a brilliant answer for 
that one.

What do you think of the Dole/KeMp 
ticket? 

After the "Real World," an article I wrote 
was published in Minority Politics that was 
about Jack Kemp, Bill Bennet and Jeanne 
Kirkpatrick, and how they were herocs to 
me. [Kemp) read the art ide, and sent me this 
note (picks up framed note). It was so cool of 
him to do that. 

I might like the ticket more if it was 
Kemp/Dole, but it 's a lillie bit late for that. 
You've had • c"-ce to ..... k with •

"Real World" and at the convention.

Based on the conver ations that I had at 
' the convention with other young people, they 
really care about the Federal student-loan 
programs. 

An issue which is really important to me is 
school choice. It's about being able to take the 
money that the government would spend on a 
chi ld for primary and secondary education at 
a public school and spend it on the private 
school of It he parent's] choice. I think Clinton 
is a really big hypocrite on this issue-just 
look at Chelsea's super-rad private school. 

As a minority, I don' t think that I would 
have ended up in graduate school without my 
Catholic school education. 
With .... benefit of hlndslCht, would

I'd do it again. This time I think I would 
try to kick Judd out instead of Puck, but I'd 
definitely do it again. Judd was so annoying.

A day hasn't gone by since the "Real

the "Real World." I ' ve moved to San Diego 
and I'm attending graduate school, but J can't 
go to PB very often. They 're pretty MTV-lit -
erate down there. But I get to meet cool peo-
ple, go to the video music awards and get to 
hang around with people I generally would-
n't even get to meet.

I'd really like to thank everyone who has 
been so supportive of me since my accident. 
I ' ve received so many lellers, Oowers and 
phone calls. Even some of the classes that I 
TA for got together to show their support. 
The IRIPS and literature departments were 
great in their support, and I really appreciate 
Ihat.

Continued from p ... 1 
said. "We need to make sure people 
are aware of the safety precautions 
they can take while on campus." 

The UCSD Student Safety 
Awareness Program, located 
downstairs in building B of the 
Old Student Center, provides rape 
education and personal -safety 
workshops - as well as counsel-
ing to victims of sexual assaults. 

"Last year we did about 80 pro-
grams for students in the residence 
hall ," SSAP Director Nancy 
Wahlig said. "We will definitely 
make sure students know the inci-
dent happened." 

Wahlig also emphasized the im-
portance of calling for a CSO es-
cort or using the buddy system. 

"On a regular basis, we're out 
there talking about how students 
can take care of themselves," she 
said. 

CSOs are available by ca lling 
534-WALK between 5 p.m. and I 
a.m., and residential securi ty of-
ficers will escort students even

wa reported to the UCSD police 
occurred in May, 1994. In that 
incident, a 19-year-old non-affili-
ate reported being raped by a 
UCSD graduate student at his Mesa 
apartment. 

UCSD police received reports 
of one on·campus rape in both 
1992 and 1993, and two attempted 
rapes in 1993. 

According to the system-wide 
Universi/y o/California Po/ice De-
par/ment Annual Repan and Crime 
Statis/ics - 1995, there were thir-
teen reported rapes last year (four 
more than in 1994) and three at-
tempted rapes (one more than 1994). 

"I think it's wi se to revisit the 
fact that crime does occur here at 
UCSD - wc're not immune," 
Jones sa id. 

Anyone with information about 
theJuly 31 incident should contact 
Jones at 534-4359.

H2 HIATUS The UCSO Guardian. 

A Student's Search for 
,Peace, Quiet and Coffee 

Several on-campus libraries and coffee shops 
enhance UCSD's study environment 

By OrK_ J.nl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The school year has com-
menced. UCSD students have 
rushed back from mind-numbingly 
boring summer vacations to joyful-
ly embrace a fun -lilled s..:hool year 
of midtenns, papers, projects, lab 
repons, final exams and, of course, 
UCSO's most popular hangout -
the library. 

Ah, yes. The library - that lit-
lte building with flickering lights 
illuminating the pale countenances 
of students who had not seen the 
sun since their last summer vaca-
tion. The libnlry - second home to 
any college student, and especially 
to the UCSD studenl. 

The Guardian has compiled a 
narrative review of some of the 
best and worst libr.uies to study in. 
as well as a critique of the coffee 
and food on campus. 

The Undergraduate Library 
(a.k.a. the "pick-up" place) is more 
of a meat market than a place to 
study. 

UGL's open, two-tiered lay-
out facilitates a broad viewing 
of the entire library's occu -

pants, which make s study -
ing nearly imposs ible : either 
someone is checking you out 
or you arc checking him oul. 

If both of you like what you sec, 
then a very cheesy conversation 
ensues. This disturbs the guy three 
desks down who is not checking 
anyone out but is actually there to 
study. 

The guy huffs and puffs and 
clears his throat, but Harry and 
Sally are deeply engaged in a dis-
eussion of who will pick up whom 
where this Friday night. 

Frustrated because he has an 
Organic Chemistry midterm the 
next day, the guy sighs and 
packs up to try the Geisel 
Library. 

He tries the sixth tloor - the 
largest in the Social Science's and 
Humanities library. It is crowded 
with frantic students from his 0 -
'Chem class, but he manages to lind 
a table. 

The flickering lights over-
head are bothersome, but to 
exacerbate the nuisance are 
loud whispers and unsuccess-
fully smothered giggles

- the table of what seems to 
be the entire Greek Council, 
clad in paraphernalia embla-
zoned with puffy Greek lellers. 

Our O-Chem man tries the sev-
enth noor next. He passes a remote · 
comer where a couple is swearing 
oaths of undying affection. Experi-
ence tells him not to take the table 
next to them. 

He passes several tables where 
high lighters are squeaking and stu-
dents are frantically pulling their 
hair oul. They must be biology 
majors. 

After circling the noor once, he 
finally finds a lone table facing a 
view of the Library Walk. 

As he begins to sit down, a 
cold rush of air suddenly hits 
his head and he feels the hair 
on the back of his neck stand on 
end. He looks up to see that the 
air conditioning vents are 
directly above his table. 

The thermostat for the entire 
library must be permanently set 
at below zero. Fortunately, Mr. 
a-Chern - the well-prepared 
biology major Ihat he is - has

Continued from INtI- 2 
he has to leave the only place 
where he had actually accom-
plished something. 

He gathers his boOks and leaves 
at 10:52 p.m. - barely in time to 
catch the elevator before it shuts 
off - and then reviews the last 
pages of his chapter despite a noisy 
group discussion at the Science 
and Engineering Library until 
11 :50 p.m. 

With several more chapters to 
review, O-Chem man rush.:s to 
Espresso Roma for some caffei ne 
to keep him going. He sips the cor-
fee and instantly regrets it ; Roma 
has awful coffee. 

He should have bought one 
from Grove Caffe while it was still 
open. Grove coffee is less expen-
sive than Roma's and tastes much 
beller. 

He checks hi s watch - perhaps 
he can grab a burrito and coffee at 
the Rathskellar before it closes. He 
rushes over to the Muir campus in 
time. He buys a lava Coast coffee 
- the rich taste is definitely worth 
the price. 

Rejuvenated and determined, he 
heads for the 24-hour Li brary 
Lounge. 

StUdying is unproductive thcre: 
the seats are uncomfonable, the 
room is crowded and the bad light-
ing is making his eyes water. Mr. 
O-Chem finally decides to go 
home. 

He tries to study in his room, 
but his roommates in the next room 

are cheering and yelling over a 
taped game. 

He cranks up a new-age CO, 
plugs his ears with foam and 
allempcs to review. His efforts are 
fruitless . 

Exhausted, he collapses into bed 
and abandons his original plan to 
pull an all-nighter; he needs some 
REM before the test.

more difficult than trying to study 
at UGL. TRPS graduate students are 
oblivious to those around them try-
ing to study - they burp out loud, 
laugh heanily and passionately dis-
cuss the economic crises of third-
world countries. 

Mr. a -Chern is beginning to 
seriously regret not buying ear 
plugs. His various library experi-
ences would most likely have 
proved more productive if he had 
used them. 

He takes a break to buy lunch.

had better not : The rood may be 
cheap, but he needs to take beller 
care of his health. 

A deep-fri ed chicken sandwich 
wou ld only exacerbatc the condi-
tion of hi s sleep-deprived, caffeine-
ridden body. 

Mr. a -Chern decides to buy a 
veggie burger at the Food Co-op. 
It is a bi t expen ive, but h~decides 
that hi s health i ' priceless. Co-op 
food is excellent. He decides lhat 
almost everything in the Old Stu-
dent Center is tasty and/or incx -

Hc buys several bluc books at

midterms; blue books are least 
expensive here_ 

Onc hour before his midterm, 
Mr. O-Chem goes to the periodical 
section of the library to relax 
before the Ie I. 

He reads People magazine 
and is glad that he did not study 
here : one study group is heat -
edly debating the fate of the 
iguana and another is giggling 
over magazine ads. 

After the midterm, he drives to 
the Scripps library - not to study,

No longer Mr. O-Chem, he 
heads for the beach to surf the ten-
sion away until the final cxam, 
when the library migration process 
will begin yet again. 

He makes a mental note to try 
the Biomedical and Medical 
libraries. Perhaps he can give the 
UGl another shot; it is open until 3 
a.m. during finals week. Hopefully, 
Harry and Sally will be studying by 
then.

Discount Bookstores 
Local bookstores cater to student market 

with low prices and wide selections 
By Grace Jane 
Senior Staff Writer 

A new quarter brings new classes that 
require new books. This means a drop in stu-
dents' meager savings accounts - and so the 
Guardian has philanthropically 
complied a list of which bookstores 
offer prices best su ited to a college 
student'S budget. 

The UCSD Price Center Book-
store is the most expensive place to 
buy anything - be it textbooks, blue 
books or an envelope. Unfortunate-
ly, many UCSD students must buy 
their books there. Science majors are 
almost required to buy their supplies at the 
Price Center Bookstore, because other stores 
do not carry the necessary items. 

Revelle Bargain Books (located near the 
Revelle dorms), offers the best prices for 
books for all majors. Books are priced at least 
30 percent below the publisher's price. 

This bookstore grants students shelf space 

to sell their books for one year. If the books 
are not sold within a year. they then become 
the bookstore's property. These unclaimed 
books are usually re-priced for quick sale, 
which means that students can usually pur-

chase books for as low as $0.25 to 
$2.00. 

Super Crown Bookstore (locat-
ed in La 10lla Village Square) also 
offers great deals, especially for 
students with literature classes. 
Paperback books are discounted at 
10 percent otT the cover's price. 
Hardbacks sell for 20 percent off 
the publisher's price, while paper-

back and hardback bcstse llers are respecti ve-
Iy 25 percent and 40 percent below the pub-
lisher's price. 

The General Store Co-op (in the Old Stu-

The Bar Review Costa Verde shopping cenler over the summer after taking over the spot previously occupied by the Soup Exchange across the way 
from Subway. 

(which it will be if you show up 
less than a half-hour before game 
time), head across the treet to Car-
los Murphy 's at Ute. Carlos Mur-
phy 's has the game on many televi-
sions, and a nifty little electronic 
game where you can try to predict 
Ihe plays that your team will run. 
They even give out prizes to the 
winner. They also have a rafne 10 
give away Chargers tickets. 

U CSD students escape study doldrums and 
drink their sorrows away on weekdays 

With a myriad of TV screens, 
great food and a full bar, Trophy's 
offers an excellent vantage point 
for the game from every seal. Add 
a crowd that is composed mostly of 
young adults and almost middle-
aged profeSSIOnals, and you' re in 
for a good time. 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Summer is over, and your mom 
and pop sent you back to school 
with that timeless gem of parental 
wisdom: "Study hard , and don't 
party too much." Unfortunately, 
this is the antithesis of what most 
UCSD students need to be told. 

Students at UCSD are far too 
often found in front of the compUl-
er terminal checking lines of code 
or pondering the theoreti ca l impli-
cations of the Heisenberg Uncer-
tainty Principle and not engaged 

nearly enough in socializing with 
real f1esh-and-blood people. 
Remember, it 's nol what you know, 
but who you know that is impor-
tant , and you aren't going to be 
meeting anyone between the lines 
of your Bio I flash cards. 

But fear 1101, ye social outcasts 
of Geisel Library. I shall attempt to 
enli ghten your deprived minds, 
shining social sunlight into your lit-
tle study holes by letting you in on 
which bars and clubs go off during 
the week.

On Monday nights Carlos Mur-

its full regular menu, and if you go

order and has a lot less fa t Ihan

PB on Gamel Avenue, and hit up 
Moose 's or MoomJoggles. Ir you 
don' t like PB , go to the other 
Moondoggies on Prospect Street in 
La Jolla. 

At Moose's you avoid the $3 
co ver with your college ID, and it 
orfers drink specials and a large 
dance noor. The DJ there plays an 
interesting mix or music. I heard 
him play "Macarcna" and Nine 
Inch Nail 's "C loser" back-to-back 
last Thursday. 

Also, at Moose's look for thi s 
cool old dude - at least 60 years 
old - CUlling a rug with party girls 
on the dance Ooor. And, contrary to 
general impressions, I didn ' t see a 
single Marine there last Thursday 
night. 

Moondoggies has $2 "U-ca ll-
it"'s all night long, which means 
that all beers and well drinks are 
only two bucks. It 's usually a pret-
ty so lid co llege crowd at the La 
10lla Moondoggi es, with a few 
'more or the PB freak types and a bit 
of an older crowd at Moondoggies 
on Garnet. Both places are general-
ly packed on Thursdays. 

After tiring of any of those 
establi shments on Thursdays, head 
down to the Shack on La 10lla 
Boulevard across the street from 
Los Dos Pedros Mexican eatery. 

The Shack has a young crowd 
and a 101 of surfer types, generall y 
a lot or La Jolla locals and some 
college kids. They have good drink 
specials and a casual. kick-back 
atmosphere. Be f~rewarned , how-
ever, that i r you show up around 10 
p.m. you ' ll probably have to wai l 
in lines that don' t move very quick-
ly. 

And there you have it. Now 
there is no excuse for UCSD stu-
dents to spend week nights in their 

. mole-holes going over calculu ' 
equations and lab write-ups. 

Go ahead . Go out and be social. 
Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomor-
row you may have graduated and 
be looking at job opportunities in

Streisand and Shakespeare among 
the numerous contenders for this fall 

and winter's box office successes 
he fall and winter movie season tradi -
tionally leaves the action, lust and 
muscle-packed gloss of the summer 
blockbusters behind to focu s on 
smaller budget productions and criti -

cal success. Among other things, upcoming 
releases take on Shakespeare and a variety of 
soul-searching issues, material making them 
appear likely for Oscar contention. A preview 
of what 's to come ... 

In "Extreme Measures" - a 
thriller starring Hugh Grant, Gene 
Hackman and Sarah Jessica Parker -
Grant plays Dr. .Guy Luthan, a doctor 
who uncovers a secret medical 
research program. Luthan's career is 
jeopardiz.ed by the moral dilemma 
and the questions he faces in reveal-
ing the details of the terrifying program. The 
film also marks the debut of Grant 's gi rl -
fri end Elizabeth Hurley as a producer. 
"Extreme Measures" opens on Friday. 

"2 Days in the Valley," a comedy thriller 
starring Danny Aiello, Greg Cruttwell, Jeff 
Daniels and Teri Hatcher, follows the lives of 
10 people over the course of 48 hours. "2 
Days in the Valley" opens on Friday. 

Tom Hanks makes his directori al debut in 
"That Thing You Do!," a fi 1m set in 1964 
that follows the success of a hometown rock 
band called The Wonders. "That Thing You 
Do!" is the title of the song which takes The 
Wonders to the top. "That Thing You Do!" 
opens Oct. 4. 

A restored edition of Alfred Hitchcock's 
e1as ie, ''Vertigo,'' will be shown in theaters 

on limited release. The restored ver-
sion of "Vertigo" opens in October. 

William Shakespeare's classic love 
story "Romeo and Juliet" features 
two extremely talented young actors, 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, 
in the title roles. The film also stars 
Brian Dennehy, John LeglJizamo and 
Paul Sorvi no. "Romeo and Juliet" 

opens Oct. 18. 
Peter Gallagher and Claire Danes playa 

father and daughter who must conquer loss 
and grief in "To Gillian on Her 37th Birth-
day." The two attend a family reunion on the 
second anniversary of the mother 's death, and 
spend time re-examining their own relation-
ship. "To Gilli an on Her 37th Birthday"

sion group which fuses varied

of energy from its audiences, 010-
dum has recently gained some 
recognition through its appearance 
in Michael Jackson 's video "They 
Don't Care About Us," from his 
"HisStory" album. 

"Olodum is somewhat of an 
eliciting cult phenomenon in parts 
of Brazil. where there are huge 
rhythm collective groups who per-
form in parades and try to outdo 
each other," Baily said. 

For those seeking an element of 
comic relief during the heated elec-
tion season, "The Capitol Steps," a 
troupe of current and former Con-
gressional staffers, will serve up a 
timely dish of political satire on 
Oct. 27. The group - which actu-
ally originated from a few staffers 
asked to provide entertainment for 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee Christmas party - makes 
light of serious political issues, and 
has a fan club which extends to a 
few former U.S. Presidents and 
First Ladies. The troupe has also 
performed on programs such as 
"The Late Show," "Good Morning, 
America" and "Entertainment 
Tonight." 

The office also runs the San 
Diego Film Festival, which kicks 
olT in February and will premiere 

appro~imately 25 films at UCSD. 
The films are selected under a sim-
ilar criteria as UEO's other pro-
grammed events, according to 
Baily. 

"We try to do the same thing 
with the film festival. One of the 
things we try to do is screen films 
which American di tributors 
haven' t picked up, but are great 
films ," Baily ~aid . 

Past premiere at the film festi -
val include ''The Madness of King 
George," "Rumble in the Bronx," 
"Like Water for Chocolate" and "EI

An Introduction to San Diego 

ArA 

DOWNTOWN 
When asked where people in San 

Diego go to pany, many people used to 
automatically respond "PB" or "Mis-
sion." In the last few years, however, the 
destination of choice for many San Die-
gans has been the downtown Gaslamp 
Quarter. 

With a seemingly endless array of 
restaurants, clubs, bars, eclectic shops, 
as well as two theaters and the mam-
moth Horton Plaza, Gaslamp has much 
to offer the leisure-seeking college stu-
dent. 

The Gaslamp is definitely the place 
for L.A.-style clubs. Establishments 
such as Ole Madrid, the Blue Tattoo, 
Johnny Love's, Club 66 and the E Street 
Alley cater to those looking to get down 
and dance. The bass, thumping from 
inside the clubs, can be heard from the 
street. Most of these clubs have a cover 

charge on the weekend of about $10. 
Most have dress codes, and there are 
usually lines to get inside. 

On the opposite end of anything 
resembling a dress code is Dick's Last 
Resort, a bar which prides itself on rude 
service and letting the customers toss 
napkins all over the floor. Bars in the 
Gaslamp Quarter generally offer a more 
relaxed atmosphere and cheaper drinks 
than do the club . Other bars include 
Croce's, a jazz bar, and Buffalo Joe's, 
which serves buffalo burritos, ostrich 
steak. and fried alligator tail. 

The Gaslamp is also home to many 
unique shops and attractions. The 
macabre Museum of Death is a favorite 
among the morbid and students who 
have just finished finals. At the Cuban 
Cigar Factory, one can see cigars being 
hand-rolled by Cuban expatriates. 

For an old-fashioned night on the 
town , couples can eat dinner at one of 
many fine restaurants, and then catch a 
show at either the Civic Theater, which 
runs a lot of famous Broadway musi-
cals, or the Lyceum Theater in Horton 
Plaza. 

Different types of cuisine abound in 
the Gaslamp, although Italian food 
seems to predominate. If spicy food is a 
favorite, check out the Bayou Bar and 
Grill , which specializes in Cajun fare . 
Hooters has a restaurant in the Gaslamp, 
as well, for those looking for a little 
more than just the food. Hooters sells 
hats and I-shirts a well. 

With all of this to offer, it 's easy 
to see why the Gaslamp has 
become such a popular des-
tination for those seek-
ing a good time .

If you are a student new to the area, three places will soon 
become familiar: the campus, La Jolla and Pacific Beach, La 
Jolla's little bastard sister to the south. 

Campus - which is quieter than a morgue at night - gets 
boring within a week. La Jolla, with its young yuppie day pop-
ulation and old-guard night population, loses its allure in two 
weeks . 

With La Jolla 's monopoly on high-priced wares and ser-
vice, Pacific Beach's business district, Gamet Avenue, has to 
cater to those people who don 't have a lot of money to spend 
- namely, students. 

Like coffee? Within a three-block radius of Garnet Avenue 
and Cass treet, there are at least seven coffee shops. Cafe 976 
pos ess a homey atmosphere, whilc sideshow freaks frequent 
Zanzibar. Cafe Crema is more expensive, but stays open latc. 
All three cafes have good coffee but can' t do espres o. As an 
added bonus, all three have a llege Club deal s. 

Restaurants abound in PB, and many are cheap. Thai hada 
II on Garnet serves up fair! good, inexpensive Thai food . 
Ichibahn on Garnet offers a go d amount of sushi for under 5. 
You ' ll pay a litlle more ror good pasta di shes at Pasta Expresso 
on Haines and Garnet and Lotsa Pasta in Pacific Plaza. Taco 
shops pop up every block or so and Taco Motion on Garnet and 
Taco urf on Mi ion Avenue are as good as any. IF spicy food 
is pleasing to your palette, then check alit World 0 Curry on 
Garnet. f:or about $6 you get a pyramid of jasmine rice and 
either a vegetarian, chicken or beef curry. Be sure to specify 
"extra-hot." 

With La Jolla'. 
monopoly on hi .... 
priced w ...... d 
services, Pacific 
".ell'. busln ... 

district, a_net 
Av .. ue, has to 
cater to tho .. 

peopI. who don't 
have a lot of 

money to .pend 
- namely, 
students. 

Pacific Beach is also home to the used 
- furniture , books, cars, and so on . Buy 
and sell used clothes at Buffalo Exchange 
or any number of such shops up and down 
Garnet. The same goes for compact discs 
- Music Trader on Gamet offers good 
deals, but don't sell your discs at the 
Wherehouse if you want more than a cou-
ple bucks . Blockbuster Music has a good 
selection of new stuff, but not many used 
titles. 

And, if you're into the dance scene, 
there 's Club Tremors and Emerald City, 
where College Club will reduce the cover. 
Both places are ugly and smell of cheap 
perfume, cologne and alcohol. Muscle 
heads, hair bears and marines frequent 
these cheesy establishments.

hang out , and I never found myself comfort-
able chilling at Chillers. My appetite for 
entertainment drove me south, far south . If 
you ever want to find me, don't call me at 
home - you' ll only get my answering 
machine - go to Tijuana. 

Preparing to go down to Tijuana is a week-
end ritual. On Friday, I watch "X-Files", take 
a shower, pick something dark out of my pile 
of marginally-clean , wrinkled-as-anything 
clothes, ann the answeri ng machine and then 
head out the door. 

Occasionally my mother - who must be 
psychic - will call and bellow that going to 
Tijuana is not going to do anything for me. 
"Mall , if you lose the ' car down there, then 

that's it! You can ride the bus or trolley for all 
I care! And if you get in trouble with the 
police, don ' t call me. I don't want to know." 
Once she begins, a five minute phone call 
becomes a thrity minute tirade. 

When everything is ready, I'm out the 
door, in my car and on the freeway cruising at 
a comfortable 80 mph. Roughly 17 minutes 
later, I whiz past the joke of a checkpoint sta-
tion at the U.S.-Mexican border. Mexican 
customs agents stop cars loaded with pretty 
girls while letting ugly guys like myse lf fl y 
through. 

I leave my car nestled between two taxi s 
on Third Avenue, concealed in layers of dirt 
and grime. In a minute, I'm on Revolucion, 
with no clear agenda. something I've done-
hundreds of times before.

the fat, Ihe skinny, the drunk andthe stupid are 
all in line, doing the Macarena. 

Only in Tijuana can you go to 10 clubs in 
10 minutes and hear the same song being 
played. The club names are about as lame as 
the musical selections - Club A, Safari Club, 
The Caves. Peanuts and Beer, Tequila Sunrise 
- but people don't seem to care. They only 
want to go out, have fun, get blouo and regret 
it all the next morning - " where did 1 gel this 
hickey?" . 

I arrive at the front door of the Vi be, cur-
rently the hottest club on Revolucion. Its neon 
sign looms ovcrhead, vi ' ible from a good four 
blocks away. Ravers, muscle boys, scantily-
clad girls and styling people Form a line that 
curves around Ihe building. The occasional 
passing of a Iranssexual prostitute and her 
oblivious date provide a modicum of enter-
tainmentto Ihe waiting people. 

Inside the vibe, it is wall -to-wall Ilesh. 
Few, if any, Marines or sailors lurk in this 
club. This is where Ihe snazzy folk of South 
Bay and Tijuana go. I'm out of place, clad in 
black with long straight hair. I belong at a 
Metallica or Queenryche I:Oncert rather than 
with these beautiful peoplc. I bump inlo one 
of the owners. He has this gorgeous blonde

his face.

much it looks like a Klingon warship, wilh Ihe 
red lighting, smoke, and surly drunkards scat-

outside. Lingering near a hOI <.log stand, I ask 
the owner whether the bacon is cal or dog. He 
lells me that it is rat. Then the police pull up 
in their patrol car, rush inlo the Bambi Club, 
come out with a six-foot talilranssex ual wC<lr-

One of thc police eyeballs me (I always look

The cop pats mc down, grahs my wrist as

Jazz Scene in Downtown 
San Diego's Gaslamp District 

Local jazz clubs offer outdated variety of 
new wave sounds and entertainment 

By Nathan Pietila 
Senior taff Writer 

For those of you who arc either 
new to San Diego or unfa miliar

scene, a word of caution: 
Don' t get your hopes up 
becau~1! the jazz cene 
here h as ~I!en bell e r 
days. 

Whilc there arc still a 
few gOlld places you can 
go to hear quality, swing-
ing, stralght -aheau jazz, a 
lot of what's termed "J:lZl.:" around 
~ Icre i~ Il!ally of a di fferent breed: 
It 's that cheesy "contemporary" 
stuff th at you hear in doctors' 
offi ces, elevators and whi Ie on hold 
with Pacific Bell. It 's the kind of 
music that Kenny G so unfortu-
nately makes millions of dollars 
producing. 

There is no shortage of opportu-
nity to hear tbi s musical junk food. 
One local radip station, FM 98, has 
a fomlat made up entirely of this 
outdated stuff. 

Thc tragic thi~g is that the "con-
temporary jaa" market is growing 
by phenomenal leaps and bounds; 

it's one of the fastest-growing seg-
ments of the recorded-music indus-
try. 

Be that as it may, seri ous ja? ~ 
art ist manage to surviv 
(i f not thri vc) in Sal 
Diego. Onc of the best 
(i f nol t hc best) grou p~ IS 
led by trumpeler Gi lbert 
Caslellanos. 

If you havc a pul se 
(and even if you aren' t 
that mueh of a jazz fa n), 
you can' t help bUI be 

compelled to respect thi s talented 
quintet's energy and lake-no-pris-
oners approach to serious be-bop. 

Whi Ie the group 's repertoire 
includes many classic jazz stano, 
dards, Gi lbert and his bandmates 
always manage cutting-edge fresh-
sound ing performances Ihrough 
their creati ve interpretations and 
always- interesting ori ginal compo-
sitions. 

Gilbert 's group pl ays down-
town every Thursday night at 
Croce's laa Bar (802 5th Ave., 
232-4338) and every Sunday night 
at Ole Madrid (75 1 5th Ave., 557-
0 146). Bring an rD . 

UCSD alumnus Hollis Gentry 
also leads a res pectable stra ig ht-
ahead jazz group. Although his 
band Neon p l ay~ contemporary 
jazz, Holl is also leads a traditional 
Jazz quartet at Elario's in La l olla 
(7955 La Joll a S h o re~ Dr., 459-
0541). Elano's u~ u a lly has a wide 
mi x of perfo rmer, III any gi ven 
111omh, from bluc~ 10 contempo-
I1ry to traditional acousti c. It 's 
not rea lly a hOlhed for traditional 
jaZl, hut you can occasionally 
ca tch ~ome good performances 
there. 

Rohusto, also in La lolla (5660 
La lolla Blvd., 459- 1972), offers 
three nights of tradit io nal jazz dur-
ing the week. otable among its 
featured artists arc Gilhert Castel-
lanos and the tasteful and talented 
guitarist loey Carano. 

There used to be a great jazz 
policy at the Horton Grand Hotel in 
the Gaslamp District. Fluti st Holly

SMOG: Tritons 
took home title with 
12-8 win over CMS 
Continued from pace 32 

In the title game, the Tritons 
found themselves up against pe-
rennial nemesis Claremont, but 
showed no remorse in pulling 
away late to claim the tight game 
and the Smog-Belt title by a 12-
8 count. 

"At one poim in the game 
they could not seem to stop us 
and we cou Id not seem to stop 
them," Harper said. "And with 
Kudirka hurt in the third period, 
we needed someone to step up; 
and Douglas Cole did that for 
US," 

Cole, nicknamed "Kahaku" 
after the high school he attended 
in Hawaii, notched three goals 
and controlled the game in the 
fourt h quarter. 

Losing All-American Mike 
Nalu to graduation seemed like a 
big blow to the team before the 
season began, but as the 1996 
campaign has progressed, the 
young squad has come together. 

"[Assista nt Coach Larry 
Sanders] and I are really pleased 
with our depth and balance this 
year," Harper said. "The lineup 
is not carved in stone and there 
are many quality guys that we 
ha ve to leave at home when we 
go on a road trip , so we are very 
pleased with our depth." 

On October 3, the women's 
water polo team wi II hold its firs t 
meeting at Canyon view pool. All 
women imerested in trying out 
for the squad are welcome

we were ready to avenge our loss," 
Pearson said, "We still have a ways 
to go because we' re in the middle of 
restructuring since we lost so many 
people from last year. But its start-

The offense, which scored 21 
goals in the first six games, is led by 
Lauren, who leads the team with 
seven goals. The Point Lorna High 
alumna tied an eight year old UCSD 
record earlier in the season, scoring 
five goals in a 7-0 demolishing of 
Pomona-Pitzer.

,Tritons Run Around Hapless Sagehens 
PWCKED: After losing their first two contests to Azusa Pacific and Cal State San Bernardino, UCSD redeemed itself by 
winning its next five games, including an 8-0 drubbing of Point Lorna on their home turf to avenge last year's bitter loss, 
By Nicole Va"'l 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Thrce years ago the UCSD men's 
soccer team celebrated an NCAA 
National Championship. The fol -
lowing year, the Tritons came within 
inches of a repeat, only to suffer a 
heartbreaking, quadruple over-time 
loss in a sudden death shoot-oul. 

Last year, the Chapman Panthers 
were not about to let UCSD get too 
close to the national title, sending the 
Tritons horne without even a regional 
championship 10 call their own. 

So what about thi s year? Despi te 
a slow start with two losses, UCSD

has managed to tum its fortunes 
around and win its last five games. 
According to junior forward Shayne 
Ferber, the best is yet to come. 

Senior forward Chris Fong 
scored twice against Pomona-Pitzer 
last Sunday when the Tritons de-
.feated the Sage hens, 2-1 . 

Senior forward Nate Hetherington 
made an incredible save to keep the 
ball in bounds on (he right before he 
passed into Ferber. Ferberthen 
assisted Fong, who put the ball 
in on a rebound off the disap-
pointed Sagehen goalie and 
scored the team's first goal. 

Fong followed up th at 
point with a near impossible 
goal that was so good that it 
even surprised him. 

Despite the scorching heat 
and numerous squandered scoring 
opportunities, the Triton managed 
to keep mo t of the game on their 
opponent 's half or the field, thanks 
to the defensive skill s of senior 
sweeper Joel Kasakoff and his fel-
low defensemen. 

"We started off slow because we 
had a whole week off," Fong said. 
"We were j ust rusty corni ng back, 
but we got lucky on a couple goals." 

The Tritons took on the Crusad-
ers of Point Lorna last Monday, 
avenging last year's loss with an 

incredible 8-0 win. Ferber, side-
lined due to illness. came off the 
bench in the second half and scored 
three times in the last twenty min-
utes. 

' 'The win was a major payback for 
last year because it was (Point Lorna's) 
first win over us in eighteen games," 
senior midfielder Brian Tumer said. 

UCS D also traveled to Biola 's 
home turf September 13, where 

they defeated the Eag les, 
4-1. Hetherington scored 
two goals and assisted on a 
third that wa scored by 
Fong, and senior forward 
Jose Ocampo contributed 
to the win with the final 
goa l of the game. 

The Tritons also shut out 
Redlands on September I I, 

overpoweri ng the Bulldogs, 2-0, 
after they outfoxed George Fox Uni-
versity on September 7, 2-3 . 

Despi te the domination di s· 
played in the las t five games, 
UCSD was defeated in its first 
two ga mes. Azuza· Pacific put a 
damper on the Tritons first ga me, 
shutting outthe team from La Jolla, 
4-0. Ca l State San Bernardino also 
contributed to the earl y season 
woes, taking the game in over-
time, 3-2 . 

"We usually start slow and we

weren' t prepared fo rthe first game," 
Tumersaid. "In the second game we 
came close. but now we have won 
fi ve games." 

After the two losses, the UCSD 
team picked itse lf up and prepared 
to take on the rest of its opponents in 
the hope of seei ng another champi-
onship. 

"If there 's one thing we got, it is 
just a lotof hearton the team that we 
have been missing over the last 

co upl e of years," Fong sa id . 
"Everyone's playing tough, every-
one wants to win and everyone's 
got the feeling that we can win and 
we can bellt people, That' s the big 
difference." I

giv ing you dirty looks. 

3. Cheering i good. Despite 
what you may have heard, it is 
good to cheer for athletes. It 's a 
moti vational thing. Just like a 
Hallmark ca rd , cheering is a nice 
way of showi ng you care. So don' t 
be afraid to jump to your feet and 
give a strong yell. Who knows, it 
might even do you some good. 
And if you want to paint your 
body blue and gold (our school 
colors forthose who didn ' t know) 
and act like a crazed lunatic at the 
games, more power to you. 

4. Go watch a sport you've 
never seen before. We have fen c-
ing, crew and many other teams 
which could use the same support 
that some of the bigger sports 
receive. You might find yourself 
a new hobby. If you've never 
been to a cross country meet, I 
couldn't even begin to describe 
the excitement and exhilaration 
generated by the competition. But 
don ' t take my word for it. Come 
out and see for yourself. 

5. Get to know some of the 
at hletes around campus. You 
might be surprised at how many 
there are out there. They 're in 
your classes and you might even 
live with one of them. Try talking 
to them. If you mention that 
you' re interested in their sport, 
they will probably talk your car 
off. You may even find yourself a 
new fri end . Don' t be shy. 

If you follow these si mple 
guidelines, I guarantee that your 
UCSD expetience will be greatly 
enh anced. Sure, we're not a 
UCLA or a USC, but come out to 
a game - you won' t have to pay 
scalpers' prices to get in. 

Who needs football anyway?

Welcome, Now 
Go See a Game 

Thanks for coming Oul. 
The 1996-97 school year is 

f • upon u , and with it comes 
another exciting year of Triton 
athletics. Let me be the first to 
extend a hearty welcome to the 
incoming freshmen class. 

To those of you who were 
denied by Berkeley and wait-
listed at UCLA, I regret to 
inform you that your Saturday 
mornings in La Jolla will not 
be filled with marching bands, 
cheerleader and the smell of 
pigskin. Alas, we do not have a 
fQOtball team. 

But before you bcwme 
discouraged and scurry off to 
the comforting sheller of 
Geisel Lihrary, you should 
know thaI we do have some 
damn fine sports learns. 

In the pa I, fan supporl for 
all sports has been poor- and 
that 's putting it nicely. 1 don ' t 
undersland what the problem 
is. We have successful teams, 
SOme of the ni cesl faci lities 
aroupd and something like 
20,000 students. There is no 
way that nly 100 people 
should attend a home hasket-
ball game. Whatever happened 
to school spirit?

PORTS 
Tritons Roll to 
Perfect Start 
DOMINATING: UCSD women's soccer has yet to 
surrender a goal in their six wins this season. 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

It 's the same old song and dance. 
Another soccer season has started, 
and the UCSD women 's team is 
back to its dominating ways. 
TlJrough the first six games 
of the 1996 campaign, the 
Tritons have outscored their 
opponents 22-0. The defend-
ing NCAA Division III Na-
tional Champions ha ve sky-
rocketed to a 6-0 tart, show-
ing no ill effects of loosing 
four of last year's star players. 

Capping the impre sive start of 
the 1996 season, the Tritons edged 
out Westmont College 1-0 in over-
time at Triton Soccer Stadium last 
Friday night. The Warriors were 
one of only two teams to defeat the 
Tritons during the 1995 season. 

"'t's always a battle against 
Westmont," Triton Head Coach 
Brian McManus said. "We' re about 
where 1 felt we would be. Obviously 

up until tonight the other games 
have been too easy. Thankfully, we 
got tested tonight and it was good 
for us." 

UCSD's efforts to avenge lasi 
year's loss. however. almost 
went for naught. when the 
sprinkler system decided to 
get into the act - soaking 
the field with only 3:39 left 
to go in the ex tra period with 
UCSD ahead, 1-0. 

The Tritons were two 
minutes away from being 

forced 10 forfeit, but Sports Facili-
ties Supervisor Josh Lawrencecame 
to the rescue - miraculously shut-
ting off the rambunctious sprinkler 
heads. 

As for the game, it followed the 
torylineof similarTriton conquests 

this season. The defensive wall of 
junior sweeper Beth Freeburg, jun-
ior right-backer Marcella Oceguera, 
and junior left -backer Lisa 
Wilkinson controlled the game from

Trust me, in my one year 
here 1 can tell you that there is 
nothing more exciting on

social life and do something 
productive.

the shutout with a diving save inside 
the penalty box.

In~tead of cramming your nose

have fun .

'Before attending your first 

UCSD sporting event, how-
ever, there arc certain guide-
lines that must be followed as a

Sports Editor 

You could say it was a big win. 
UCSD men's water polo Head 
Coach Denny Harper thinks so, and 

with good rea on. 
The Tritons posted a 
14-8 victory against 
the highly-rated UC 
Davis team on Sep-
tember 13. 

The young Triton 
squad has jumped out 
to an impressive 6-1 

record to open up the 1996 cam-
paign, with the only loss coming at 
the hands of Division I powerhouse 
USC. The impressive 6-1 start in-
cludes a perfect 4-0 record at the 

On the first day of competition, 
UCSD took care of business, 
trouncing Occidental College by a 
score of 19-5. Six Tritons scored 
two or more goals, including fresh-

man Jason Boettner (3), Amir 
Montass ir (2), Tim Wells (2), 
Adam Bollenbach (2), Douglass 
Cole (2), Ross Mecham (2) and 
Gordon Beh (2).

"They had one kid who could

Harper said. "We' re a hard-swim-

we played well the first day .".

Bollenbach and Mecham, who 
scored three goals apiece to blow 
the Poets away.
