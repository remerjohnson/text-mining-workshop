Warren junior's suicide

Economists blast Bush policies 
Republican calls Kerry 'easy choice' in election 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN

Earl Warren College junior 
Kunal Patel ended his own life with 
a self-inflicted shotgun wound in 
the early afternoon on Oct. 4, 
friends said. 

Patel's housemates and a friend 
ruscovered rus body in the garage 
of their shared Mira Mesa home 
shortly after 10 p.m. of the same 
day, nearly 10 hours after police 
believe he committed suicide, 
according to housemare and 
Warren junior Scott James. 

"All members of the Warren 
College administration are terribly 
saddened by the death of Kunal 
Patel," Warren Provost Steven 
Adler said. "We extend our heart-
felt condolences to rus family and 
friends." 

Warren junior Jessica Wu, 
Patel's close friend, said the two 
spoke at least once a day and 
spent the summer together. She 

said she became concerned after 
she did not hear from Patel 
despite his promise the day 
before to call her. 

. Patel appeared happy to others 
prior to his death and was known 
at the college as an outgoing per-
son who often sat at a table in 
Warren and . attempted to 
befriend anyone who passed by, 
Wu said. 

"To the rest of the world, every-
orie just thought he was this big, 
happy person," Wu said. "He was 
just the person who planned the 
parties. He wasn't as happy as he 
seemed. No one took a second and 
just wondered, 'Hey, how could 
someone be trus happy and giving 
[all the time)?'" 

Though they knew that Patel 
was upset over family problems, rus 
roommates did not know the 
degree of rus despair, James said. 
He appeared emotionally stable

With less than a month to go 
before election day, two leading 
economists offered their analyses 
of competing economic plans 
proposed by presidential candi-
dates President George W Bush 
and Sen. John Kerry CD-Mass.} 
during an OCt. 7 visit to the 
Faculty Club. . 

In a 90-minute discussion 
before audience members that 
paid $50 each to attend the UCSD 
Economics Roundtable, UC 
Berkeley professor of economics 
Brad DeLong and MIT Sloan 
School of Management Dean 
Richard Schmalensee agreed in 
calling the Bush administration's 
economic policies unsatisfactory 
for both liberals and conservatives. 

Sponsored by the campus eco-

Publishers probe leReserves' policy 
Association fears system violates copyright 'fair use clause' 

If MARGRO GONZALES 
Senior Staff Writer 

After reviewing UC electronic 
reserves program policies, the 
Association of American 
Publishers said that it believes that 
the university may be in violation 
of a federal copyright law. 

The AAP sent a letter to 
UCSD officials in June question-
ing the use of certain postings 

made on the campus libraries' 
Web site, according to UC coun-
sel Mary MacDonald. The organi-
zation has been in correspondence 
with the campus for six months 
and has scheduled a November 
meeting with UC officials to dis-
cuss system-wide policies for use 
of copyrighted materials. 

"The AAP was concerned with 
the lawful use of the material in 
the electronic reserves," 

MacDonald said. "They wanted to 
know whether we had permission 
to use the material or if its use fol-
lowed the 'fair use clause' under 
the copyright law. Their aUegation 
was that UCSD 'eReserves' didn't 
fit into either of these two criteria 
and trus then transcended into 
questioning the policies of all

UCSA endorses Huerta 
for regent board seat 

By ALESSANDRA RADICAn 
Contributing Writer 

Following the controversial res-
ignation of Regent Haim Saban last 
month, the UC Students 
Association has called on Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger to appoint 
Dolores Huerta to the 'UC Board 
of Regents as rus replacement. 

"[She] isn't afraid to go into the 
Capitol and say 'this is what we 
want,'" UCSA University Affairs 
Committee Chair Steven Alvarez 
said. , 

Saban left the board in 
September after the San Diego 
Union-Tribune published his atten-
dance record at meetings and state 
legislators called for his resigna-
tion. Saban cited personal reasons 
for his decision to quit. 

Huerta served as a regent in 
2003, after former Gov. Gray Davi 

appointed her to fiJI a board spot 
left open for a period of six months. 
After Davis' recall in 2003, 
Schwarzenegger did not reappoint 
her to a full 12-year term. 

Huerta gained the support of 
the UCSA after demonstrating that 
she shared the priorities of the 
organization during her brief stay 
on the board, especially during SnJ -
dent prote ts over higher fees in 
November 2003, according to 
UCSA President Jennifer Lilla. 

"I think that she would see the 
benefit in building tudent electoral 
power," Lilla said. 

Huerta is known mainly for her 
work alongside Cesar · Chavez in 
organizing farm workers and co-
founding the United Farm 
Workers Union. 

"It would be inspirational for

I BRIEFLY 
Triton Taxi stickers set to 
expire at end of month 

Students with current Triton Taxi stickers will 
need to pick up new stickers to continue using 
the service after Oct. 30. 

Though current stickers do not include an 
expiration date and were not intended to expire 
when originally given out to students, AS. 
Commissioner of Student Services Kian Maleki 
said the move is an attempt to cut costs for the 
program that provides safe rides home to stu-
dents. This year, it has been renamed AS. Safe 
Rides. 

Because the stickers have remained the 
same for many years, former students who do 
not pay current fees have continued to use the 
service, contributing to its rising costs, Maleki 
said. 

To pick up new stickers, students must sign 
a waiver at the AS. offices on the third floor of 
Price Center. The new stickers will also expire in 
June and rpust be renewed every year. 

Students who do not update their stickers 
will not be able to use the shuttle service 
after the end of the month. Questions about 
the new service can be sent to 
kmaleki@ucsd.edu. 

High school students 
worried about college costs . 

Half of all college-bound students say that 
cost is their largest concem about university 
education, according to a new national survey 
published by. College Partnership, a private col-
lege preparatIOn company. 

Of the 1,750 students sampled, 50 percent 
said money was their biggest fear, more than 
twice the number who said they worried about 
having the grades to qualify for the best uni-
versity. 

Only 10 percent of parents in the same poll 
expressed concem about the cost of a college 
education. Almost one-third said their greatest 
concem was that their student would leave the 
home. 

In the survey, 60 percent of students said 
that career and major options offered by col-
leges represent the most important criteria in 
choosing where to attend, comrared to the 13 
percent who said the college s reputation is 
most important. 

Agency: Marijuana hurts 
learning, academics 

The federal government's Office of 
National Drug Control Policy has launched a 
national outreach campaign to warn parents 
and students that marijuana use may have a 

negative impact on teen leaming and acade-
mic success. 

It plans to publish an "Open letter to 
Parents" in major papers, including the New 
York Times and USA Today. Experts in the fields 
of education, health and youth drug prevention 
will sign the letter. 

Deterring student use of drugs and alco-
hol is essential "to safeguard not only the fab-
ric of our society but also, ultimately, our 
economic security: U.S. Secretary of 
Education Rod Paige stated. 

Research shows that students who aver-
age 0 grades or below are more than four 
times as likely to have used marijuana in the 
past year as students who report A averages, 
according to Richard Wong. executive director 
of the American School Counselor 
Association. 

Almost four million youth aged 12 to 17, or 
16 percen~ have used marijuana at least once 
in the past year, the lates! National Survey on 
Drug Use and Health found. 

Preuss School requests 
funding for student buses 

UCSD's Preuss School, the campus-run 
charter middle and high school, is facing a 
shortage of school buses for its more than 
700 students. 

Because of state budget cuts, the local 
school district has eliminated bus service to 
the school, which instructs low-income stu-
dents who want to be the first in their families 
to attend college. 

As in the 2003-04 school year, the school 
will need to lease the 15 buses it n~s to 
provide transportation for the students. It has 
asked community members for donations to 
raise the $375,000 needed to fund the pro-
gram. 

So far, the Jack in the Box Foundation has 
provided a S25,OOO gift to help pay the costs. 

Climate change contributed 
to large extinction 

While humans played the largest role in 
the extinction of two-thirds of all large mam-
mals on the planet. climate change was "a key 
part of the recipe: UC Berkeley researchers 
said. 

Their analysis of the large wave of deaths 
that occurred between 50,000 and 10,000 
years ago was published in the October issue 
of the journal Science 

Because climate change is occurring more 
rapidly t~day, the pl~net faces inevitable 
mass extinctions and unpredictable ecosys-
tem changes' in the future, the researchers 
stated.

Death: Housernates discovered friend's body 
canrinutd from page I 

during conversations the night 
before his death and spent the 
evening playing a game of poker 
with friends. 

"We knew he had some family 
issues, but everyone does," James 
said. "We didn't know it was weigh-
ing down on him. We knew he had 
some problems, but nothing that 
we would suspect he would do any-
thing like this." 

Patel's other housemate, 
Warren junior Daniel Sandor, 
originally returned to the house 
around 5 p.m. When he did not 
find Patel home, he proceeded to 
watch television and study, 
according to James. Another 
friend came over later in the 
evening. The three became wor-
ried after noticing Patel's car 
parked outside and began to look 

around the house, eventually 
coming to the garage, which nor-
mally remains unused. 

Police believe that Patd pur-
chased the shotgun one or two 
weeks prior to his death, James 
said. 

"We had no idea," he said. "We 
wouldn't allow a firearm in the 
house." 

San Diego Police Depanment 
spokesman Dave Cohen was not 
available to provide further 
details. 

For close friends and for the 
entire Warren community, Patel's 
death has left a large void, Wu 
said. 

"I think almost everyone in 
Warren knew him," she said. "He 
was a very big people person. He 
was just a very selfless person who 
spent a lot of his time taking care of 

other people. He cheered a lot of 
people up and he meant a lot to a 
lot of people. He really liked bring-
ing people together." 

During the summer, Wu said, 
Patel came to the campus even 
though he had no classes to 
attend so he could interact with 
new students enrolled at the uni-
versity. 

Wu and James accompanied 
more than 20 other friends to 
attend Patd's funeral on Oct. 9 in 
Glendale, Calif. 

Warren administrators are also 
planning a campus memorial, Adler 
said. The university's Psychological 
and Counseling Services will pro-
vide free emotional counseling for 
students.

Regents: Huerta worked with Cesar Chavez 
conrinued from page I 

students to see someone who has 
had a long career in grassroots to 
come to this position," Lilla said. 

Huerta would also serve as a 
positive role model for students, 
according to A1varel.. 

"She's always been one to advo-
cate that we need to educate our-
selves," Alvarez said. "She makes up 
some of the curriculum we learn in 
our classrooms ... , I thi!!k that~ very 
inspirational for underrepresented, 
marginalized communities." 

It normally takes two or three 
years to become fulJy comfortable 
with the way the board works, 
according to student Regent Jodi 
L. Andersen. Huerta, however, 
showed early promise during her 
brief time on the board, she said. 

A total of 26 members serve on 
the UC Board of Regents. The 

governor appoints 17 of the mem-
bers to 12 -year terms seven serve as 
pan of their political offices, one is 
a student representative, and two 
are non-voting faculty members. 

"Traditionally, regent appoint-
ments are plum positions," Lilla 
said. "It is a tremendol1$ honor to 
be appointed regent. ... One regent 
voice really can make a difference." 

Regents make decisions that have 
a major impact on students, accord-
ing to A.S. PresidentJenn Pae. 

"If there is an ally on the Board 
of Regents, that ensures support 
for issues such as financial aid, 
tuition, • outreach, eligibility 
requirements and overall access 
into higher education in ~e 
University of California system," 
Pae stated in an e-mail. 

Many of the current regents who 
serve on the board are business~ 

pIe by profession, which further 
prompted the UCSA to support 
Huerta in hopes of promoting 
diversity, Lilla and Alvarez said. 

"[Huerta's appointment) would 
bring a very good new and much-
needed perspective to the UC 
regents," Alvarez said. "It's not just 
about making sure the bills get paid." 

Schwarz.enegger~ office declined 
to comment on the UCSAi; endorse-
ment, calling the appointment 
process a private matter until the 
governor reaches his final decision. 

"Traditionally, the regent 
appointment process is closed and 
that is something we'd like to see 
changed," Lilla said. "[With a) 
more balanced process .. , it could be 
a very different Board of Regents."

Future of YouCSD.com hangs in balance 
School justified in protecting rights Administration should back off 

By KEUY GILBERT 
Staff Writer 

Granted, the name is clever. YouCSD.com (or, if you rearrange the capitals, YoUCSD) is witty: this 
site is about YOU, put YOUrself in the uni-
versity, put the YOU in UCSD, ha ha. Very 
punny. 

Too bad the University of California's 
administration, didn't find the address quite so 
cute. Since the California Education Code 
grants the, University of California full rights 
to its name and bars using the school's name in 
a hyperlink without permission, UCSD offi-
cials have ordered YouCSD.com to change its 
address, claiming copyright infringement. 

The Web sites anon}'Tnous creators, of 
course, are assuming the role of martyrs. "This 
threat from the university has no merit," they 
stated. "From the beginning we expected cam-
pus administration to try and use such strong-
arm tacti cs to censor 
us." 

It's pretty easy for 
the UC administration PRO to come off, once 
again, as the bad guys: 
Big Brother Is 
Watching; Down with 
Free Speech; Do Not 
Resist the University of 
California. After all, they're taking legal 
action against a Web site run by a group of 
students trying to form an online "communi-
ty" and innocently expressing their opinions. 

Catch the key clause there? "Expressing 
their opinions." The University of 
California, thankfully, allows more diversity 
of thought than is reflected by 
YouCSD.com; it is fitting, therefore, that the 
site should not represent the university, and 
all its constituents, in the public eye. Both 
precedent and prudence demand that UC 
officials require YouCSD.com to find a new 
forum immediately. 

The University of California should not 
allow full representation of the trademarked 
UC moniker to the latest revolutionaries, for 
doing so would be unfair to the other, 
arguably more legitimate, groups already 
shut down or relocated for similar reasons. 

In September 2002, for example, UCSD 
took minor action against the UCSD Che 
Cafe Collective. When the collective's Web 
site, BURN!, published a link to an alleged 
terrorist association, the Webmasters were 
ordered to remove the link. And in the fall of 
2003, the site formerly known as 
UCSDuncensored.com, a message board on 
which students could post thoughts or ques-
tions about the campus - but which had 
failed to obtain permission to use the trade-
marked "UCSD" name in its hyperlink -
was also ordered to remove the name from 
the link to comply with the University of 
California's code. The site has remained 
active, but is now simply known as 
SDuncensored.com - mildly disappointing, 
since it's a good Web site - but, really, little 
harm done. 

In both instances, the university was 
entirely justified in protecting its image and 
intellectual property. 

YouCSD.com shouiJ be asked to change 
its address and be denied its official-sound-
ing ties with UCSD, because carefully 
screening, and even removing Web sites that 
use UCSD in their hyperlinks is not only the 
University of California's right but also its 
responsibility. Not all ofUCSD's 24,000 stu-
dents and countless alumni want to be asso-
ciated with the pretentious content of 
YouCSD.com, even if the site's creators have 
a disclaimer on their site. 

In one instance, for example, a 
YouCSD.com poster attacked the musical 

preferences one individual noted on his 
Xanga site. YouCSD.com 's posters have 
called George W. Bush "awful," have harsh-
ly criticized the new chancellor and have, in 
general, forfeited any sort of critical or liter-
ary merit, instead opting for personal attacks 
and unsubstantiated, uneducated rants fatu-
ously directed at any sort of differing opin-
ions. 

The students, of course, have every right 
to express these views. But there are more 
appropriate ways to do it. Sure, rant all you 
want about the cameras preventing theft in 
on-campus dining halls. Don't hold back-
keep telling us how you "had no idea 
Brigham Young University rejected lI1Iyont, 
much less some girl from Laguna Beach." 
Give us your little blurbs on Fall Fest, other 
campus events and the A.S. CounciJ's newest 
scandal. 

But respect the codes enforced by the 
state of California, and keep such comments 
to forums unaffiliated with the university-
say, your own Xangas, or maybe a Facebook 
common-interest group. (Or, if you're feel-
ing ambitious, get adventurous and create a 
real community instead of an online one.) 

Meanwhile, the rest of us will be thankful 
that the university doesn't force such opin-
ionated content on all of UCSD.

T he Empire has struck back.. The uni-versity has asked the creators of the month-old Web site YouCSD.com 
to change its name due to copyright 
infdngement. After all, YouCSD.com 
includes "UCSD" in the web address, and 
"UCSD" is university intellectual property. 
However, its hard to see how the universi-
ty is harmed by the existence of a blog with 
the name "YouCSD.com." It's highly 

Riley Salant.f>elrte/Ciuoldion 

unlikely that anyone who visits the blog 
thinks, "Hey, I didn't know the university 
had a news blog!" And just in case anyone 
does think that, the blog includes a dis-
claimer disavowing any official link with 
the university. 

Nonetheless, the university has ordered 
the nascent blog to "cease and desist" while 
turning a blind eye to such sites as 
MeetUCSD.com, UCSDcycling.org or 
UCSDkasa.com. According to campus 
counsel Ann Parode, the university initiat-
ed its process - well-honed after forcing 
UCSDuncenSQred.com to change its name 
- in response to specific complaints about 
the site. In its short histoty, the blog has 
definitely rubbed some students and 
administrators the wrong way with its con-
tent, but as disagreeable it may be at times, 
the content does . not warrant such an 
extreme response. Requesting a formal 
apology or retraction would probably be an 
acceptable thing for the university to do. 
Attempt to shut the blog down? Much less 
appropriate. 

Despite its statements to the contrary, 
the university appears to be singling out 
YouCSD.com because of its occasional 
anti-administration posts. The GlUlrdiil1J 
Web site, http://7UUTW.ucsdgruzrdiil1J.org, has 

undoubtedly received complaints in the 
past. And non-Christian groups might 
easily take exception to the UCSD 
Campus Crusade for Christ Web site, 

bttp:llw1J!W.sllnditgoccc.org/~,sd, which 
prominently features UCSD in its banner 
and i~ infinitely more likely to be confused 
with an official UCSD Web site. Neither, 
however, has likely been as outright criti-
cal of the adrninsittation as YouCSD.com. 

And what exactly does the administra-
tion hope to accomplish by attacking a blog 
run by a handful of students? It's surprising 
that Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who until 
now has demonstrated a deft touch and a 
savvy public relations mind, would approve 
of such a quixotic attempt to quell what Iit-
de cri ticism she has recei ved to date, espe-
cially after UCSDuncensored.com, a highly 
useful service for students, was shut down 
for a year last year on the same grounds. 
Such overkill can only serve to legitimize 

(ON 
the site and, by exten-
sion, some of its more 
extreme views, and 
help it reach a wider 
audience thanks to a 
front-page, above-
the-fold story in the 
last issue of the 
GUllrdill1l. Whether 
true or not, there's 

also the idea - implicitly espoused by 
YouCSD.com, among others - that the 
administration on campus cares more about 
research than students and that students are 
apathetic. While those concerns are 
overblown and cliche, a highly publicized 
attempt by the university to silence dis-
senters cannot help its case. 

In fact, a significant number of students 
probably agree in large part with some or 
most of the views advocated at 
YouCSD.com. If Fox really is interested in 
student views - and not just the student 
views identical to hers - then she would be 
wise to act to preserve the blog and read it 
regularly as a means of gauging student sen-
timent. Of aU the things that disgrunded 
students could do, starting a well-designed 
and informative news blog that happens to 
have "UCSD" in the hyperlink should rate 
pretty low on the scale of things the univer-
sity should be actively trying to squash. 

Despite all this, there is one positive 
thing this blog uproar has brought about: 
I(s an early test for our new chancellor. Last 
year, the university shut down a Web site 
that provided forums for students to talk 
about school and swap textbooks, two things 
the school should be actively encouraging. 
While the Y..,uCSD.com case is much less 
clear-cut due to the Web sites nature, Foxs 
handling of the case will show srudents 
much about her character. Fox will hopeful-
ly show strong leadership and not hide 
behind the decisions of her subordinates. 

In a letter to the editor in the Sept. 27 
issue of the GrumJiil1J, Fox stated that she 
had made "enhancing student life" a "top 
priority," and that "an open dialogue with 
UCSD students is essential to reaching 
our goals for the campus." 

The balls in your court, Chancellor Fox.

Younger Japanese won't use the

students I've met are international-
ly minded citizens, enthusiastic 
about visiting other countries and 
curious about foreign cultures; 
adults seem less interested in the

Then there's Governor Shintaro

for foreigner-led riots in the event 
of a ' major earthquake - never

persuade people like Ishihara, a pop 
novelist before his rise to power. 
Nor does he need to concern him-

was last reelected with more than 
70 percent support. 

Ishihara plays upon people's 
worst fears. Since 98 percent of the

disparate ethnicities are a source of 
national pride - and any deviation

failure - Japan's racial homogene-
ity is the source of its national iden-
tity, according to people like 
Ishihara, whose brand of outspoken 
nationalism has made him one of 
the country's most popular leaden. 

Despite the shared pride over its 
common heritage, this nation is 

just like any other major industrial-

its culture from abroad - primari-

R IUnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Editorial left out 

co-op complexities 
Editor: 

Your Oct. 7 editorial entided 
"Many are blameworthy in co-op 
controversy" contains a number of 
factual errors. 

The Memorandum of 
Understanding is not a sublease. 
Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association do 
have separate subspace agreements 
with each of the four co-ops; but 
the Memorandum of 
Understanding is the overarching 
contract between UCSD, 
Associated Students, Graduate 
Student Association and the co-ops 
that imposes numerous obligations 
on the parties, including the obliga-
tion (in paragraph IX) to enter into 
the Master Space Agreement and 
subspace agreements. 

The subspace agreements are 
renewed annually when the 
Associated Students and Graduate 
Student Association vote to contin-
ue oversight of the co-ops, which 
was done earlier last year, routine-
ly, as in previous years. It is ludi-
crous to call this action premature; 
failing to take it would have meant 
termination of all the agreements, 
which would certainly have been 
even worse for the co-ops. 

In addition, the Association 
Students and Graduate Student 
Association never "found them-
selves leasing space that they no 
longer controlled." Both councils 
expressed clearly their intention to 
renew the Master SpIce Agreement, 
which is their right under paragraph 
IX of the Memorandum of 
Understanding: "The A.S. and GSA 
may grant two-year renewal options 
for the Master Space Agreement." 

What campus administrators 

have asserted is that the Associated 
Students and the Graduate Student 
Associations renewal of the Master 
Space Agreement is invalid without 
administratorS' approval, and that 
the Master Space Agreement 
entered a month-to-month hold-
over status as of April 29, 2004, 
which is subject to termination upon 
30 days' notice. 11Iat 30-day notice 
was given to Associated Students and 
the Graduate Student Association by 
Director of Student Policies and 
Judicial Affain Nick S. Aguilar in a 
letter dated Aug. 23, 2004. 

Let us be clear: A.S. and GSA 
have taken every reasonable step to 
reach a mutual agreement for the 
co-op spaces, including anending 
numerous meetings over the sum-
mer. They can hardly be blamed 
for the current state of affairs.

English words are used as dec-

oration, regardless of their mean-
ing. "Slack Power" advertises a 
tanning salon. T-shirts proclaim 
"Erection Delight!" A construc-
tion company asks passersby, 
"What kind of polygon does your 
dream look like according to your 
idea?" And because bikes are 
everywhere, the subway stations 
warn, "No Thanks, Bicycles." 

Not that America has done 
much better. America's incom-
plete understanding of Japanese 
culture is showcased through kanji 
tattoos that their owners can't 
read, Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles and movies like "The 
Karate Kid." IncidentaIly, thanks 
to that movie, I was "Daniel-san" 
for 6ve years. Not until junior 
high did kids finally stop using the 
suffix. Every time the "Karate 
Kid" mania would fade, another 
sequel would come out, and I'd 
enjoy another eight months of Mr. 
Miyagi imitators chanting, "wax 
on, wax off," and "Daniel-san." 
Nine years later, I am again 
Daniel-san. 

Despite their knowledge of 
American pop culture - WiIl 
Smith is on 1V all the time and 
Brad Pin sings in Japanese in a 
Gap commercial- Japanese stu-
dents seem only vaguely aware of 
the U.S. presidential election, and 
only slighdy more conscious of 
their own country's politics. They 
have hazy recollections of a porn 
star and the Terminator doing 
something in California last year, 
but every time I try to teU them 
that 1 ran for governor, they just 
don't get it. Only two Japanese 
students have easily understood 
the "I ran against Arnold" con-
cept, and one of them was the 

daughter of a city councilman, 
already familiar with words like 
"ran" and "governor." 

This is an endless source of 
frustration for me. 

To hurt an egotist, ignore him. 
Those who think highly of them-
selves - "attention whores," as 
my friend likes to put it - like 
people to know who they are. I did 
not prepare for this newfound 
anonymity when I bid farewell to 
UCSD's comforting familiarity,

Politically, most know Bush is the

nent, but not much beyond that. 

This is not so of UC students 
in Japan. While most are wholJy

of these Californians packed into 
the university'S audiolvisuallab to 
watch the 6rst U.S. presidential 
debate - broadcast live in Japan

Reserves: Academic Senate 
'unhelpful', publishers say 

continued from page t 
system." 

The eReserves is a free service 
for students and faculty that pro-
vides online access to the material 
professors use in course readers. 

Allan Adler, the vice president 
for legal and government affairs for 
the AAP, said professors made large 
numbers of postings in violation of 
authors' and publishers' copyrights. 

"We wanted UCSD to review 
wi th us the process it uses to 
maintain the accountability and 
management that ensured [that] 
the copyright policy was complied 
with," Adler said. "[The Academic 
Senate] responded ro the chal-
lenge in a fairly vague and unhelp-
ful manner. All they told us was 
that they made changes in the 
management and overseeing of 
the accountability of the material 
used . "They didn't inform us of the 
clear copyright policy they were 
enforcing." 

Current university practices 
may violate the federal fair use 
clause. a principle that allows use of 
portions of copyrighted text for 
commentary or criticism. 

According to Marlayna 
Christensen, the direcror of access 
services with UCSD Libraries, 
the material posted on eReserves 
do meet the criteria of fair use 
under the law. 

"[The university] is well within 
[its fair use rights], which allow 
for the educational use of copy-
righted material." Christensen 
said. "The use of the material is 
determined to be of fair use so 
long as it follows the guidelines 
stated in the clause." 

Adler said he disagreed with the 
legitimacy of the postings on the 
service and with the assumption 

that educational purposes will qual-
ify for royalty-free use of printed 
materials. 

"Not every educational use is 
within guidelines of the [appropri-
ate legal clause] ," Adler said. 
"Some starutory criteria under the 
federal law determine whether the 
us.: complies with the clause." 

The AAP has not asked the uni-
versity to pay back royalties, and 
possible legal action is yet to be 
determined, according to Adler. 

"We still have legal options, but 
because we view this as a universi-
rywide problem, we want to com-
municate with the Office of the 
General Council and with the UC 
Board of Regents concerning the 
infringement of copyright laws in 
the eReserves service." he said. 

The AAP has also requested 
that the materials placed on 
eReserves be available to the gen-
eral public in order to qualify for 
fair use. 

No plans have been made ro 
shut down the service. according ro 
MacDonald. 

"We don't know if there is any 
illegal situation at all." MacDonald 
said. "We are going to check all the 
policies to see if some, or if any, 
revisions are needed." 

If changes are needed, they will 
be made in such a way that takes 
into account the needs of students. 
according to MacDonald. 

"If anything, we will only be 
looking into revisions here and 
there," MacDonald said. "The uni-
versity would not act in any rash 
manner . ... It is very important to us 
that our students and faculty have 
access to the libraries' resources."

Lease: Tacone to offer student meal discount 
cantinued from page I 

Centers Director Gary Ratcliff said. 
"We wanted to try something new." 

Tacone, the wraps vendor 
UCAB selected to replace Star 
Wraps. operates an establishment 
at the University Towne Center 
food court and will open for busi-
ness by mid-December. Like Star 
Wraps, Tacone is a restaurant that 
features wraps in international 
styles. The restaurant's menu con-
tains items that include a 
"Samurai" teriyaki wrap and a 
"Chinatown" chicken salad. 

"When you get Tacone stuff. 
the quality and freshness is really 
better. and that's what I think sold 
people,» Ratcliff said. 

The decision to recommend 
replacing Star Wraps was not 
unanimous. however. 

"I like [Taconel, but I really do 
like Star Wraps," said junior 
Carrie Du, the Revelle College 
representative on the board. 
"From what I've seen from 
Tacone's menu, they don't have 
the same offerings." 

Board members initially "split 
half and half' on' the decision to 
remove Star Wraps. according to 
Du. 

Some patrons of the establish-
ment also said they were disap-
pointed with the decision. 

"Star Wraps is the only place 
to go to get a unique Ic:ind of 
food," Revelle College freshman 
Aria Jafari said. 

Despite a loyal fan base, 

Ratcliff said that "four threads 
convinced us that we needed to 
open it up and take proposals for 
new restaurants." 

These threads included Star 
Wraps' low sales, a review by 
UCAB's food committee, evalua-
tions created through a secret 
shopper program and poor health 
inspection reports. 

" When you get Tacone 
stuff, the quality and 

freshness is really better, 
and that's what I think 

sold people. " 
- c.v RIIdII, cIrec:ID(, ~CenIm 

According to a UCAB state-
ment, criteria for seeking a new 
vendor included "food quality, 
menu diversity. prices, cleanliness 
standards, restaurant experience, 
management style and financial 
performance. " 

The three restaurants original-
ly considered for a new lease 
included Star Wraps, Tacone and 
World Wrapps. Tacone's low-cost 
srudent menu. vegetarian options 
and experienced management 
team were important factors in its 

selection, according to the com-
mittee's statement. 

"We looked for a global. 
healthy alternative," Du said. 

Tacone's proposed UCSD 
menu includes discounted student 
combination meals, which come 
with half of a wrap. a soup or 
salad, chips and a drink for 54.95. 

"They had to have something 
where a student on a tight bud-
get can get a meal and a drink for 
less than five dollars," Ratcliff 
said. 

In discussions last spring, 
UCAB had originally indicated a 
desire for a mom-and-pop busi-
ness, but it selected the Tacone 
franchise over the privately oper-
ated Star Wraps. 

"We decided that we want the 
best vendor, whether it's indepen-
dent or whether it's a franchise," 
Du said. 

Star Wraps manager Damon 
Woo declined to comment on the 
decision, but he expressed con-
cerns last year over the accuracy of 
the secret shopper program. 

"I have enjoyed serving the 
students here at ·UCSD." Woo 
said. 

Future UCAB plans include 
selecting seven new restaurants to 

' occupy the Price Center expan-
sion by 2007 and selecting a Thai 
restaurant for the renovated 
Student Center.

Calling himself a moderate 
Republican and conservative on 
economic policy, Schmalensee said 
that, while he worked on the 2000 
campaign to elect Bush, he no 
longer agrees with the way the 
president is running the COlDltry. 

"What I find shocking is in the 
Republican rhetoric," Schmalensee 
said. "Nobody can live with long-
term structural deficits, so you cut 
taxes and that forces a cut in spend-
ing ... This administration has 
absolutely not restrained spend-
ing." 

Of the roughly S125 billion 
increase in spending between the 
2000 and 2004 fiscal years. about 
S20 billion went to homeland secu-
rity, according to Schrnilensee. 

Meet with representatives from over 80 companies in an informal setting. 
"I found the first Bush adminis-

tration congenial on economic pol-
icy. and at the start, I found this 
president, when he was campaign-
ing. congenial," Schmalensee said. 
"[It was a] class of sman people, but 
I'm not backing it now." 

He said he was .measy with. the 
size of the tax cuts signed by Bush 
and pointed out that, while Ronald 
Reagan cut taxes in 1981 and 
brought down the tOP tax rates, 
taxes were raised several times later 
on. Schmalensee said there is no 
such Bezibility now in ·America. 

"We are in a situation where our 
deficits are being financed by the 
Japanese and Chinese central banb. 
This is not a terribly comfortable 
position. " Sdunalensee said. 

DeLong closed his prepared 
remarks with a message to 
Republicans. 

"In the short run, I think what is 
to be done is to vote for John 
Kerry," DeLong said. "John Kerry 
not only has all the natunl advan-
tages of being a Democrat over a 
Republican, but Bush has the nat-
ural disadvantage of being an 

"What a good conserva.tive 
Republican does is cut spending 
under these conditions, and what 
this administration has done is to 
spend more and more, .. 
Schmalensee said. "I think the 
answer has to be higher taxes." 

Like DeLong, Schmalensee 
concluded by endorsing Kerry. 

"On balance, 1 think the choice 
is between a liberal Democrat ... 
who at least tries to think through 
issues, and a conservative 
Republican who governs not from 
the center, but from the right, who 
has made disaster after disaster in 
policy area after policy area and 
doesn't seem capable, on the evi-
dence we have, of running a 
thoughtful policy," Schmalensee 
said. "I think this is a reasonably 
easy choice, if not necessarily a 
pleasant one."

UC!!iD: TUNNELINIi 

Through the abyss: UCSD's vast tunnel network runs around Revelle College and meets underneath Jqhn Muir College and 
UCSD Medical School, making a full loop down Library Walk and up toward Thurgood Marshall College. 

CLASSIFIED 
The idea of underground tunnels naturally leads to fantastic specu-

lations. Some believe the tunnels under the UCSD campus were con-
structed during the Vietnam War so police coul~ trav~I'quickly from 
one end of campus to the other in the case of a protest. Others 
assume that the tunnels were built as a safe refuge for teachers if a 
student strike ever exploded out of control. Then there are those who 
are confident the tunnel:; don't exist,. that they are merely a myth. 

The tunnels do In fact eXIst, and along with information 
provided by' Central Plant Services, former students' accounts of late-
night exploring provide entertaining proof. Top: One of the many entrances to the underground tunnels. Bottom: Along the tunnels run massive pipes carrying water at 350 

degrees Fahrenheit. 

If anything, there is confusion as to what 
the tunnels are used for. UCSD lecturer John 
Granger encountered a Story frol11 a graduate 
student about the use of the tUnllcls. 

"1'111 not sure how they got in, but in the 
late 60's, a lot of people went down there," he 
said. " I just heard people had parties down 
there ... there were windowless rooms where 
people would party." 

'¥hile this account may very well be true, 
the intended purpose of the runnels is to 
transport hot liquid through pipes. In the 
early 1960s, engineers began constructing a 
scries of tunnels, coinciding with the devel-
vpmem of Revelle College. The tunnels con-
tain hot-water pipes, which provide the cam-
pus with its central heating. Since these tubu-
lar piping wonders arc so narrow, they do not 
allow much room along the main passages 
for a person to walk through. One must crawl 
through some sections, while other parts are 
more navigablc. 

The mnnels in Revelle are round and 
connect underneath John Muir College and 
UCSD Medical School, completing a loop 
down Library Walk and up to Thurgood 
Marsllall College. There are also side runnels 
that run under dle Physical Plant Services 
building and through to Galbraith Hall. 
\Vith the completion of the tunnels under 
these first three colleges in 1975, the con-
struction of more extensive passageways was 
considered. However, because the cost was 
too great, administrators decided to wait 
until 2004 to resul11e the expansion. Now 
contractors are developing passages that run 
under RIMAC and Out to Voigt Drive. 

According to Krista Henkels, environ-

mental resource manager at Plant Resource 
Facilities, "the tunnels are the cheapest' way 
right now to cool and heat t.he building. And 
it minimizes the use of overhead power over 
the campus." 

"The mystery [of the tunnels) is far more 
interesting than the tunnels themselves," 
Henkels sa id. 

So what is it about this "mystery" that 
lures people to the tunnels? For Bill Hines, a 
UCSD alumnus, it appears to be the thrill of 
adventure. Hines proudly reveals his delin-
quent days of tunnel exploring on a Web site, 
http://t1l1mels.,,-ipod.comlursdNmn.html. He 
provides tools that have perhaps proved to be 
useful to other student explorers. A detailed 
account of each passage takes the reader step-
by-step through the passages. There is also a 
hand-drawn map indicating the main route 
and side mnnels, as well as a photograph fea-
turing "anonymous" tunnelers. 

Though his tunneling escapades sound 
exciting, Hines is careful to include a dis-
claimer on the Web site, assuring readers 
that "This page is meant to quell the mystery 
1)f the runnels, thereby negating the need for 
UCSD students to explore the tunnels them-
selves." 

Despite his efforts to deter them, many 
students have infiltrated these runnels in the 
past. Another UCSD student, who chooses 
to remain anonymous, has explored the 
depths of the tunnels a total of eight times, 
both on his own and with friends. They 
describe the tunnels as seven feet high by five 
feet wide. Inside, electrical wires and water 
pipes run throughout, and the heavy fluores-
cent lights are on 24 hours a day. There is 

. 

also colorful 
graffiti sca'ttered 

across the walls frOI11 past students marking 
their territory. 

Although the student and his friends were 
able to enter the tunnels, the consequences 
of trespassing inevitably caught up with 
them. 

"It was the epitome of underground tun· 
nels," the student said. "An alarm went off 
once when J was down there. It made me feel 
like a little boy ... until I got artested. After 
the ordeal was over, one of my friends had to 
write a letter of apology to the chancellor." 

Students should be advised that the police 
will investigate if the alarm is triggered. 
Central Plant Services takes its security pre-
cautions seriously. Still, some students are 
willing to take the risk. 

The tunnels can be dangerous and are 
therefore off-limits to both students and die-
hard spelunkers. The reason? The hot water 
that runs at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and 350 
pounds per square-inch through a network of 
pipes remains liquid only because of the high 
pressure. If the pipes were suddenly to burst 
or leak, the liquid would rurn to steam and a 
person in the tunnels could be scalded or suf-
focate due to the confined space. 

Central Plant Services is now taking extra 
precautions to keep unwanted visitors out. 
Director of Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs NiCk Aguilar said that security mea-
sures have tightened since Sept. 11. 

"From what I am aware of, from time to 
time students explore the tunnels out of 
curiosity, a dare or drinking," Aguilar said. 
"However, this will no longer be treated as a 
prank. It is a threat to security on campus." 

Aguilar said that breaking into the tunnels 
is a serious offense. There remains the possi-
bility of expulsion and police involvement if 
an unauthorized student is caught in the tun--
nels. 

"The punishment depends on the person~ 
prior history of misconduct," he said. 
"However, I wouldn't be surprised if students 
were held in custody for security screening. 
They will be detained for a longer period of 
time, to ensure there is no connection io ter-
rorist attacks. " 

Aguilar said he recalls only one or two inci-
dents a year of people breaking into the tun-
nels since Sept. 11. 

"I don't want to sound alarming, but I don't 
want to minimize the situation," he said. 
"Under the circumstances [a student's actions) 
may result in consequences never expected." 

Despi te the increased security since 
Sept. 11 and the physical dangers of 
entering the runnels, it is still possible to 
take a tour of them, by contacting 
Central Plant Services. This is a safe 
alternative to a self-guided expedition, 
and it gives students a chance to finally 
bare wimess to the mysterious 
underground tunnels first-
hand.

Haln, a traditional Persian dessert, is served with tea 
at funeral ceremonies. The sweet taste of halva is believed 
to alleviate the pain and shoek of the loss of a loved one. 
During these ceremonies, a spoon is passed from one 
guest to the next, each taking a spoonful of the pudding 
while sending out a silent prayer for the deceased. This 
ceremony is often repeated on the anniversary of the loved 
one's death. If a guest does not take a bite of haln or at 
least drink a glass of tea, the family believes that the spirit 
of the deceased will be offended. 

= 

The focal ingredient in Persian haIva is saffron, which 
gives the dish its distinct flavor. Saffron is commercialized 
in powder and thread fortnS. The- only part of the saffron 
flower that chefs use in their cuisine is the vibrant red stig-
ma, which despite its potent red color, produces yellow 
dye. Saffron is ubiquitous in the Middle East and has a 
great influence on Persian cuisine mainly because Iran is 
the largest producer of saffron in the world.

The Sex 
Guardian 

Lillian Nedwick 
Welcome back, horny college 

srudents, to the Sex Guardian, 
keeper of most secrets sexual and 
sensual. This week's topic will not 
be the orgasm. It is actually far 
from it, simply because, contrary 
to a few opinions, sex isn't always 
about the quest for the Big 0 
(though I could never claim to 
diminish its importance as the 
eventual glorious outcomer 
Instead, I will discuss the things 
often neglected when leading up 
ro that screaming moment, what I 
term the "spaces between." 

Now, I wish I could relate a 
specific story on .thjs idea, but 
honestly, sueh experiences are so 
boring that they tend to blur in a 
mishmash of fun but unfulfilling 
romps in the bed (or car, or on 
campus, or whatever). But at least 
I'm not alone: In relating sexual 
experiences, my friends and I 
have often noticed that some men 
have made us feel like those con-
nect-the-dot coloring booles that 
we used in kindergarten. They 
trace a line: mouth is dot one, 

neck/ears are dots two and three, 
nipples are dot four (with a slight 
spiraling around the breast), then 
a line down the stomach to num-
ber five, the genitalia they believe 
are calling their name and need to 
be touched ASAP! (This is not to 
say that heterosexual men are the 
only culprits. The fault is proba-
bly equally shared by all genders 
and sexualities, though I can only 
vouch for one at this moment.) 

I'm not saying this formula 
doesn't work; it obviously docs, if 
people continue to do it over, and 
over, and over again. But that 
only covers 15 percent of the 
body. There's much more to be 
explored, played with, teased and

Sex: Search for pressure 
points and ticklish spots 
continued from page 9 

pleased. 
The back, for example. Sure, 

you've kissed the shoulders and 
caressed the back while your part-
ner is bouncing away on top, but 
what about giving it all the anen-
rion it starves for? 

Give it love in the form of 
small, teasing kisses all the way 
around the back, across the shoul-
ders and neck, and then down one 
side, to the butt, back up and 
around, alternating light kisses, 
bites and licks as you go. And it 
has to be light at first, as a sort of 
wake-up call, and then increase in 
pressure. 

Use your hands. the very tips 
of your fingers, to scratch and 
pull up on the skin. using the 
front of your nails as well as the 
backs to give your partner new 
sensations. And when you lick, 
don't just slurp as if the lucky per-
son is a human lollipop; keep it 
reasonably wet, but stay away 
from the saliva showers. Girls, 
use those breasts to your advan-
tage; let them fall on your part-
ner's back, and while you're lick-
ing up the spinal cord, trace two 
lines up his back with your nip-
ples. 

A few other neglected spots to 
play with are: the side of the rib 
cage and the underside of the arm 
that lies next to it. You'lI have to 
usc trial and error, though; there 
is a fine linc between moans and 
giggles, and these arc ticklish 
spots. Once you figure out the 
right pressurc, it'll send shivers 
vibrating up and down your part-
ner's body. 

Therc's also a pressure point 
right next to the hipbone on the 

abdomen that one can lick and 
fondle. and most likely get some 
interesting form of thrashing as a 
response you may have to hold 
your partner down. 

And if you're really feeling 
experimental, go ahead, take a 
shower together and play with the 
"exit door." With the help of lube 
or saliva, slide your fingers 
between the cheeks, tease the area 
between the anus and the vagi-
na/testicles, lick the ass and inner 
thigh. I know it seems icky, but 
soap and the shower are well 
worth the waves of naughty plea-
sure that could run throughout 
your body if you're willing to 
explore a bit. 

Unfortunately, space forbids 
me to cover every single sexually 
ignored part of the body, but with 
a litde common sense and a sense 
of adventure, I'm sure you can 
imagine endless places to include 
on your sexual map, especially if 
you don't actually have sex. 

Loole for pressure points (back 
of the knee), nerve endings (toes), 
and places you KNOWhave never 
seen the light of loving (the anus). 
Of course, this is easier for the 
couple who have the time and 
interest to explore, but even for 

. the one-night stands, where all 
you are thinking about is the 
ecstasy of completion, you might 
as well make it something worth 
the walle of shame the next morn-
ing. 

The more you do it, the fur-
ther away from the heaten-down 
path of mouth-neck-ears-nipples-
sex you go, and the longer the 
foreplay, the better the sex, for 
both the penis and the vagina. So 
get moving! Make new dots!

concinW!d {ram page r6 

softball team in attendance 
with banners to cheer on fel-
low athletes. 

"[The softball team) all 
had signs for all of our play-
ers," Ohta said. "It's really 
neat to see the other teams 
supporting [us), and [ thinlc 
it's really good and it helps 
everybody. " 

UCSD next faced off 
against Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Oct. 8 at RIMAC 
Arena in the first-ever 
match between the two 
teams. Cal State Monterey 
Bay just entered the CCAA 
conference this season after 
being in the National 
Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics. 

The Otters are at the bot-
tom of the CCAA standings 
with a 2-15 overall record 
and 0-9 CCAA record. Cal 
State Monterey Bay will 
have to look elsewhere for its 
first conference win, because 
UCSD beat the team deci-

si~ely in tluee games, outhit-
ring the Otters .348 to .083 . 

In game two, Cal State 
Monterey Bay had a .000 
percentage compared to the 
Tritons' .372. 

This time, senior outside 
hitter Stacy Dunsmore 
dominated the match offen-
sively and defensively with 
17 kills and 18 digs. The 
Otters did not come close 
to Dunsmore; with their 
top two players registering 
only five kills apiece in the 
losing effort. Ohta con-
tributed 39 assists and nine 
digs while Canape also 
added six kills. 

The Tritons were also 
solid defensively, netting 
eight blocks and 52 digs 
while the Otters recorded 
three blocks and 38 digs. 

So far, UCSD has only 
lost one game or less in all its 
match victories, and 14 of its 
19 wins were sweeps. 
Although winning has come 
relatively easy for the 
Tritons, they are cautious 
about becoming too compla-
cent and are always looking 
to keep an edge to their 

game. 
"I think our team is so 

good that we should win a 
lot of matches fairly easily," 
McFarland said. "[We) run 
the risk of just going out 
there and kind of going 
through the motions. It's 
our best practice when we 
play matches. We need to 
keep improving and work 
on things that are difficult 
for us, so we are getting 
stronger as the season pro-
gresses." 

To keep from getting too 
comfonable with winning, 
the players remind them-
selves not to look too far 
ahead and instead take it one 
game at a time. 

"We try to take each 
game as its own challenge,» 
Hogan said. "You never 
know what some of these 
teams are going to bring. 
We're one of the best con-
ferences. A lot of times, 
we're considered the team to 
beat, and because of that 
we're ready to take anyone 
on."

UCSD also holds the third 
spot in the Far West 
Region . Meanwhile, the 
loss dropped the Coyotes to 
4-5-2 and 2-3-2 in the 
CCAA. 

The Tritons were forced 
to play without sophomore 
forward Alise Malley, who 
was injured at the Tritons '

3. McManus expects the 
starter to miss another 
week before returning to 
the lineup.

Oct. 10 in Seaside, Calif. 
Results from the match 
were unavailable at press 
time. 

----------------------------- .. last home match against 

Cochran's goal is her 
team-leading fifth goal of 
the season; she leads UCSD 
in scoring, with 12 points, 
followed by sophomore mid-
fielder Megan Dickey, who 
has four goals and two 
assists, giving her 10 points 

Although the Tritons are 
not undefeated, the team 
does boast the highest win-
ning percentage of all pro-
grams in the CCAA.

upcoming season, -'0 it seelned 
only fitting to change the scenery 
as well. 

"This is a great facility," head 
coach Mike Montgomery said. 
"There are three practice courts, and 
easy in-and-out access is a bonus." 

The Warriors' roster is loaded 
with a wide range of new talent. 
Small forward Mike Dunleavy was 
a Duke superstar and is predicted 
to have a breakout season. Fourth-
year shooting guard Jason 
Richardson is an NBA Slam Dunk 
Contest champion and is noted as 
having improved his all-around 
performance with each season. 

Leading the new players will be 
former Lakers point guard Derek 
Fisher. Fisher, whose memorable 
clutch shot in game five of the 2004 
Western Conference Semifinals 
thrust Los Angeles past the San 
Antonio Spurs, hopes to help end 
the Warriors' 10-year playoff 
drought. 

"We definitely have a shot at it, .. 

of the team's 2004-05 season. 
Veteran center Dale Davis was 
obtained in a trade from the 
Portland Trailblazers, while rookie 
Luis Aores was part of an eight-
player trade between the Warriors 
and the Dallas Mavericks. Davis 
has been in the league for 13 years 
and has more than 100 games of 
playoff experience, while Aores 
was ranked No. 5 in NCAA scoring 
last season. 

The front court will also benefit 
from the No. 10 pick in the 2004 
NBA Draft, Andris Biedrins. 
Biedrins is an 18-year-oM Latvian 
who has been labeled as a future star 
by scouts from all over the world. 

Along with new players and a 
new coach, the team is running a 
different style of training. 

"The camp is more fun, and 
everything seems to be a lot more 
positive," Dunleavy said. 

Coaches and players had advice 
for student athletes interested in 
pursuing careers in professional 
athletics. 

and in order to make up for lack of 
size, taking full advantage of their 
individual qualities is key." 

Assistant Vice President of 
Operations and future Hall of Fame 
player Chris Mullin stressed the 
importance of time management. 

"An athlete must realize that 
being able to organize time for 
socializing, studying and practice is 
part of college athletics," Mullin 
said. "Studying is most important of 
all." 

The Warriors seem to be on the 
right track, as they attempt to build 
a playoff team by establishing their 
foundation at UCSD. 

"Twenty-three thousand top 
students and athletes are here try-
ing to learn the steps to having a 
successful career. It only seems 
fitting that the Warriors will 
begin their success here at 
RIMAC," Sixth College student 
Scott Weisberg said while waiting 
outside RIMAe Arena for auto-
graphs.

"Students need to realize that

Volleyball gains more momentum RIMAe plays host 
to Warriors camp 

Golden State team puts new 
bench to work at UCSD 

Team extends win streak against Sonoma, Monterey 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

The e days, it seems like 
nothing can stop the second-
ranked UCSD women's volley-
ball team. Opposing teams have 
simply been unable to surpass the 
Tritons in any category except, 
perhaps, errors. Even when 
Sonoma State head coach Ed 
Grassl interrupted the Oct. 7 
match several times, complaining 
to the referees about the taunts 
the l,JCSD fans were aiming at 
the Seawolves, it did not stop the 
Tritons' rhythm. UCSD swept 
Sonoma State at RIMAC Arena 

Anna MacMurdo/Guonion 
Put away: Senior Stacy Dunsmore 
and the Tritons dominated Sonoma 
State and Monterey Bay. 

(30-17, 30-16, 30-22) and also 
swept California - Collegiate 
Athletic Association newcomer 
Cal State Monterey Bay (30-17, 
30-15, 30-IS) the following night 
on Oct. S. 

"[Grassl] was complaining 
about our fans and that makes us 
upset because we appreciate our 
fans so much," senior setter 
Teresa Ohta said. "We don't want 
them to be told by the other 
coach that they can't cheer for us. 
Heckling is a part of sports, a 
part of athletics; it's just what 
happens. I think it fired us up 
even a little bit more." 

The Tritons refused to let 
Sonoma State come close to win-
ning the match, attacking, serving 
and defending solidly throughout 
the match. Ohta guided the Triton 
offense by distributing 3S assists, 
20 more than her Sonoma State 
counterpart, Tina Mesquita. 
Freshman Natalie Facchini con-
tinued to assert her role as a staple 
on the Tritons' defense, contribut-
ing a match-high IS digs. Senior 
middle blocker Katie Hogan led 
the team with 15 kills and com-
mitted only one error for a high 
.636 attack percentage, followed 
by junior outside hitter Lindsay 
Crandell, who registered 10 kills 
and eight digs. Senior outside hit-
ter Bonnie Wilson and senior 
middle blocker Kendra Canape 
had seven kills apiece, and Wilson 
also added eight digs for the 
match. 

The omy roadblock for the 
Tritons was their slow start in 
game one, trailing 4-0, but 
Canape led the comeback with 
three kiUs accompanied by an 
attacking error by the Sea wolves, 
which quickly tied them up at 4-4. 
The teams rea mined deadlocked 
for the next several points, but 
after UCSD took an 11-10 lead, it 
never relinquished the advantage,

San Bernardino defeat 

Tritons record 10 season wIns with 
comeback victory over Coyotes 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Associate Sports Editor 

The No. 19 UCSD women's 
soccer team continues to fire on all 
cylinders, stretching its winning 
streak to five games as sophomore 
All-American forward Kelly 
Cochran scored with nine minute 
remaining to lift the Tritons over 
Cal Sa1te San Bernardino, 2-1, on 
Oct. 6. 

"It was another typical game," 
UCSD head coach Brian McManus 
said. "There's no easy game against 
Cal tate San Bernardino, but the 
girls kept battling away. It was a 
hundred-mile-per-hour game, with 
lots of end-to-end stuff." 

The Tritons struggled in the 
fir t few minutes, giving up an 
unassisted goal to the Coyotes' 
senior defender Amy Raymond in 
the 10th minute. Raymond capi-
talized on her free kick opportuni-
ty, getting the ball in the upper 
net from 25 yards out. The 
Tritons had five corner kick 
opportunities in the first half, but 
were unable to capitalize. They 
were also outshot, 5-2, by the 
Coyote in the first half. 
However, Raymond's goal proved 
to be the only goal that would get 

past UCSD senior goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger, who registered 
three saves in the game. 

In the econd half, UCSD 
countered with a goal off of a cor-
ner kick in the 54th minute. 
Freshman mid fielder Caitlin Ryan 
came off the bench and found the 
back of the net in the midst of a 
scramble to tie the game at I-I. 
Kristina De La Rosa picked up an 
assist on Ryan's goal. Cal State San 
Bernardino freshman goalie Leslie 
Rhodes was injured in the play and 
was replaced by sophomore 
Melody Spoelstra. 

With less than nine minutes left 
in the match, McManus put 
Cochran back in the game after 
resting her and she scored thc 
game-winning goal with a shot 
from 18 yards out, assisted by 
freshman forward Ali Lai. 

"Kelly Cochran was making a 
run toward the goal and stude her 
foot [out] to send the baLI up over 
the goalie'S head," McManus said, 
describing Cochran's goal. 

With the win against Cal State 
San Bernardino, UCSD improves 
its record to 10-1 overall and 6-1 
in the California Collegiate

finishing the Seawolves off, 30-17, 
in game one. 

"It took us a while to get into 
it, to get fired up," Ohta said. "We 
did have kind of a long break since 
we last played; we had a week of 
practice with school and every-
thing so we weren't on top of our 
game. I'm just glad we picked it 
up, and 1 think we played a lot bet-
ter in the second and third game." 

On a roll, the Tritons contin-
ued their dominance, getting out 
to a 10-6 lead before Grassl began 
complaining about the home fans' 
heckling. Play was halted for sev-
eral moments, but it did not break 
UCSD's concentration. The team 
held on to its lead to win game 
two, 30-16. 

"1 think [Grassl) was so frus-
trated with his team at that point 
that he thought he had to try any-
thing," Triton head coach Duncan 
McFarland said. "He thought he 
would staU the game by bringing 
[the heckling) up and get the offi-
cials to do something about it. I 
think it had a bad effect on 
[Sonoma State]. They played 
worse after that." 

Game three was not any better 
for the Seawolves, although they 
kept close to the Tritons, tying 
them up at 8-S. Sonoma State ran 
into Hogan, who exploited the 
Sea wolves' defense, bombarding 
them with nine kills with no 
errors. While Crandell also got 
her licks in, scoring seven of her 
10 kills with no errors. UCSD 
completed its sweep, 30-2Z. 

"I was just really connecting 
better tonight," Hogan said. "We 
had a pretty big crowd - I love 
that. It's so much fun to play for 
them." 

Indeed, the home crowd was an 
advantage for the Tritons, espe-
cially with the UCSD women's

Swimming anticipates strong season 
Blue and Gold Meet offers optimistic outlook for 2004-05 

By AMBER MAmN 
Staff Writer 

The Triton swimming and 
diving team kicked off its season 
on Oct. 9 with its own UCSD 
Blue and Gold Meet. 

Unlike past seasons, when the 
team has not had its first dual 
meet until November, this year 
the Tritons must be prepared to 
match up against UC Santa 
Barbara on Oct. 22. The Blue 
and Gold Meet, a time trial event 
in which UCSD swimmers race 
exclusively against one another, 
was designed to prepare the 2004 
team for its upcoming meets. 

Both the men's and women's 
teams had a great 2003-04 sea-
son. The women's team placed 
third at the NCAA Finals, while 
the men's team improved from 
years past, placing fifth after 
coming in 14th in 2002-03. 

The team has some strong 
returnees, such as senior breast-
stroker Rosanna Delurgio, who 
swept the breaststroke event, 
winning the 100-yard race for 
the second year in a row and the 
200-yard race the foHowing day. 
She had an impressive meet on 
Oct. 9, winning the 50-yard and 
ISO-yard breaststroke and swim-
ming the breaststroke leg of the 
winning 4OO-yard medley relay. 

The men's team also has a 
number of promising returnees. 

Senior Michael Baier won both 
the 300-yard individual medley 
and the 100-yard freestyle, 
demonstrating his versatility. 
Another senior, Kurt Boehm 
from Germany, also won two 
events, including the ISO-yard 
butterfly and the 400-yard 
freestyle. 

The men's team also boasts 
many promlsmg freshman 
recruits. One of the closest races 
of the meet was the 400 medley 
relay, in which the 'N team, after 
trailing on the first three legs of 
the race, pulled out a win by just 
0.68 seconds. The second-place 

'B' team included freshman 
breaststroker Evan Hsiao, who 
also won the ISO-yard breast-
~troke. Sophomore Mike Lahey, 
who dominated the ISO-yard 
backstroke and pulled off a nar-
row win in the 50-yard ind~vidual 
race, also took a lead in the back-
stroke leg of the relay. 

Another promising newcomer, 
Joel Tounellotte, had an impres-
sive meet. 10 the men's SOO-yard 
freestyle, a tight race in which 
TourteLlotte and junior Ben 
Falcioni were neck-and-neck
