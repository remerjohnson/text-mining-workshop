Budget Freeze Hits Humanities 
Sciences Hurt by Cuts Least 

Rose De Costa 
Staff Writer 

The humanities, social sciences, and arts will 
be especially hard-hit by the budget freeze 
announced last December by UC President 
Hitch. The sciences, which receive large 
amounts of their aid through research grants, 
will not be affected as much. 

Under President Hitch's guidelines limiting 
University spending, the freeze was put on 
employment of new personnel with state funds, 
purchase of equipment with state funds, and 
out-of-state traveling utilizing state funds . 

According to Dr. Harold Cohen, chairman of 
the Visual Arts Department, the budget freeze 
gives out a "general feeling of depression." 

Cohen relates, "We're not badly affected 
because we didn't have much to start with. The 
only real problem we've had as a result of this 
freeze deals with hiring visiting professors ior 
the third quarter. The chancellor, being able to 
make a 20 per cent exception, allowed, in this 
particular case, the hiring of an art historian to 
go through." 

Travel Hit Hard 
What was a real blow was the cutback on out-

of-state travel. Most departments felt that this 
was the area in which they were most affected. 
Cohen had anticipated recruiting new 
personnel , but with the cut back on hiring and 
out-of-state traveling, the chances for hirmg 
new professors seem dismal. The Visual Arts 

Department presently has only 10 full-time 
state-funded positions. 

Speaking for the APIS Department, Dr. 
Henry Booker sees no real effect that the budget . 
freeze has on his department. " We all have 
serious problems but it doesn't rise directly 
from the freeze . The problem we have is the 
computer ratio. There are far too many 
students per teacher , and if we don 't hire any 
more teachers, there might be serious 
problems." 

Booker felt that his department was in a 
fortunate position as far as purchasing 
equipment was concerned. APIS got most of 
their equipment with their new building. 

As of the present, funds for the building of the 
new theatre have been allocated. Tom McCorry 
of the Drama Department says the money for 
the new theatre had been allocated before the 
freeze went into effect, so it seems highly likely 
that UCSD will still be able to build a new 
theatre. 

Trips Cut Back 
McCorry says that the Drama Department 

will have to cut back on a few theatre trips. 

"Small departments are always affected by a 
budget cutback. What may be a small cut to 
another, larger department is like murder to 
us." 

Dr. Robert Elliot, head of the Literature 
Department, says, "We're hurting ! The Lit 
Department depends entirely on state funds and 
the freeze took away some positions for visiting 
professors. We got a few of these positions back 
but at a considerably lower level. Where we 
were asking for full professorships we had to 
settle for assistant professors." 

Elliot feels that this will reduce the academic 
level of his department and it will hurt. "The 
Literature Department needs three or four new 
people to fill key positions. Without them, the 
department will not be able to maintain itself at 
a distinguished level. " 

Forecasts for the future seem gloomy, as 
most heads of departments view this freeze as 
only the beginning of more budget cut-backs. 
Problems then would arise in finding ways to 
accommodate increasing enrollments and 
higher costs.

Protesters Halt Jensen Speech 

JIm sm, (center) apologizes to Dr. Arthur Jensen la the name 
of tbe UCSD student body after stucients refused to allow tbe 
controversial Berkeley psycbologlst to speak. Karl KeatlDg 
looks on at rigbt. 

Dr. Arthur R. Jensen was 
forced to .postpone a lecture at 
Salk Institute Thursday when a 
group of UCSD students clapped 
loudly and rhythmically so that 
the UCB professor of education 
was unable to speak. 

Leslie Orgul of Salk Institute 
introduced Jensen to the crowd 
of over 200 people, many of 
them UCSD students, attending 
the 4 p.m. lecture. Orgul ex-
plained that after Jensen had 
completed his lecture and a 
discussion of its scientific 
aspects was concluded, the 
session would be thrown open to 
a general discussion. 

When Jensen took the 
podium, however, the applause 
given him, instead of dying 
down, was replaced by a stri-
dent, rhythmic clapping from 
anywhere between two and 20 
students in the audience. An 
average of six or eight people 
were clapping at anyone time. 

After about two minutes, 
Orgul took the podium again to 
ask the clappers to refrain, 
warning that the lecture would 
be postponed. When the clap-
ping continued another five 
minutes, the meeting was ad-
journed and Jensen met briefly 
with reporters, saying, "It is a 
disgrace. It is impinging npt 
only on my rights but on the 

Childrens Camp Planned by AS 
Robert Miller 
Stoff Writer 

A camp for disadvantaged San Diego area 
children to be sponsored by AS is presently in 
the planning stage. revealed Bruce Morden, AS 
commissioner of community services. The site 
for the proposed camp is at Camp Elliott. which 
isdue east of the Miramar Naval Air Base. 

The motivating desire behind the 
development and the eventual operation of the 
camp is to provide poverty - area children with 
a chance to see more than their own 
neighborhoods. noted Morden. 

Students to Serve as Labor, CouDselors 

Students will be utilized both as volunteer 
labor to get the camp buildings in usable 
condition and as counselors once the camp 
begins operation. The plans pre ntly call for 
the camp to be used as a summer day camp 
beginning thi coming summer. said Morden. It 
i al 0 hoped that week-long es ion during the 
ummer and weekend s ion during the 

quarter could be held . h add d. 

According to A Pre id nt Mike Palcic. who 
worked for the Unit d ommunity ervlc in 
an Diego la t umm r. th camp format would 

be uniqu in thi ar a. 

The Camp Elliott site is part of a large tract 
of land that was donated to the University 
through a federal grant in 1965. It is presently 
being used as an animal farm for lab specimens 
for the Medical School and as an ecology 
preserve. The Camp Elliott portion measures 
approximately 12 acres in size. 

DonatioDs Hoped For 
Morden hopes that in addition to the student 

labor force , he can acquire tax-deductible 
donations of building materials from San Diego 
area businessmen. He said that the phy ical 
plant at Camp Elliott, which consists of two 
dorms, a dining room and snack bar, an office 
building. a garage and a storage facility, needs 
refurbishing due to lack of use. 

He also said that the major area that may 
need funding from AS will be the proce of 
attaching nearby utility lines to the camp, 
which would probably r quire profe ional help. 
Mord n think that thi may call for money 
from r gi tralion fee . 

Mord n plan to contact veral poverty -

In the meanwhile, arguments

had tried to quiet them to

On USS Providence 

Students Dine With Admiral 
Juliana Cinque 

Staff Writer 
One 's impression of military men, especially 

of those in the top positions, leads to images of 
men whose chauvinism is obvious, and whose 
tolerance of an opposing viewpoint is almost 
negligible. It is certainly not in keeping with 
this image for a three star admiral to invite 
univer!.'ity students to have dinner with him. 
Yet, this is precisely what happened last 
Thursday, when members of Diddo Clark 's 
Contemporary Issues Class were treated to 
dinner aboard Admiral Raymond Peet's 
flagship the U. S. S. Providence in San Diego 
Harbor. Aware of the military's bad press, the 
admiral is trying to improve the military's 
image by talking with members of the 
community and the university. 

Boarding the ship, the twelve students 
somewhat unexpectedly received a military 
salute. On entering the admiral's dining room 
and seeing the formally laid out table, the 
students were just beginning to become aware 
of the culinary delights ahead. 

Over soup and scallop quoquilles, the admiral 
admitted that, "The worst thing we could do 
militarily is go into a place like Vietnam. We 
can't fight a jungle war because the other side 
can get replacements all the time." 

Open as he was to some of th defects of th 
military. th admiral 's loyalty to the 
government could not be contested, as A 
Presid nt Mike Placic was to find out. 

have erv d 

The admiral's aide , Bob Woodrum, carried on 
a separate conversion with those at the opposite 
opposite end of the table. As the green goddess 
salad was being eaten at the end of the meal , in 
the European style, he revealed some of the 
admiral's personal history. "The admiral has 
been to school most of his life. He received his 
masters degree from M. I. T." The admiral has 
a standing bet with his son. who is now a junior 
at Duke University, that if his son can give a 
math problem he can 't solve, the admiral will 
give a hundred dollars. The son has yet to 
collect. 

After a dessert of lime chiffon pie and 
demitasse coffee, the students were given a tour 
of the flagship . 

After leaving the admiral , the discussion of 
the meal reached th uperlatives. "Thi is 
probably the best meal I'll ever have in my 
life," said one of the students. Of the admiral 
himself, Diddo said, " Perhaps he got to be 
where he is through being an expert, and not as 
a combat hero, " He's probably as liberal as he 
could be and still be an admiral. "

Nixon's " Justice 
Fania Davi Jordan and 
Franklin Alexand er-

' otion.1 Coordinator, lor 
'\ationsl l n itcd Commi tt ee 

To Free \ n"elEi Da\ i .. 

Lest President ixon feel that the world is 
ready to pat him on the back for his 
"generosity" in inviting 14 Soviet scientists to 
Angela Davis' trial , the UCFAD would like to 
point out a cruel paradox : Soviet citizens will be 
given VIP treatment in a small San Raphael 
courtroom while thousands of worried and 
concerned Americans, especially black 
Americans, will be prevented by a tight security 
net from witnessing the prosecution of a 
militant black professor who has fought for 
their rights. 

Where is Nixon's fair-minded concern for 
justice? 

Where was he when Reagan and his Regents 
fired Prof. Davis. an act clearly violating the 
Regents' own " no political te t .. policy? 

Where was Nixon when a Marin County judge 
handed down an unconstitutIOnal order illegally 
preventing both Prof. Davis and her attorneys 
from seeing the transcript of the testimony 
resulting in a Grand Jury indictment? 

Where was Nixon when Angela was beaten by 
police at the time of her extradition in the 
Women's House of Detention In NYC~ 

Where was I'>ixon ? He was warmlv 
congratulating Hoover for having captured 
Prof. DaVIS "and other terrort t " while 
igning the new Anti-Crime Bill. What fairne s. 

what a sense of justice : here is the President of 

the U.S.A. condemning Prof. Davis in front of 
200 million Americans before 12 Americans 
have even been chosen to judge her inno<;ence. 

When Nixon attacked Charles Manson, 
making front-page news across the country. his 
arbitrary tactics created a national furor- but 
where are our courageous journalists and 
politicians now? Surely it's no coincidence that 
when a resolution was recently put before the 
United ations to make 1971 the year to fight 
racism. The U.S. delegate abstained. 

We' re amazed by Nixon's offer to 14 Soviet 
cientiSi3, amazed by his willingness to play on 

an image of Prof Davi he him elf created: so 
that. he might look like a more benevolent kind 
of dictator before world opinion. 

Finally. we doubt that the presence of 14 
Soviet scientists in San Raphael will accomplish 
what the Declaration of Independence. the Bill 
of Rights. many tate law and hundreds of 
organizations have faIled to accompli h. 
namely to protect the rights of poor and 
oppressed Amertcans. and especially the large 
black and brown minoritie 

If ~ixon has the power to open up the 
courtroom to 14 Soviet citizen . th n he 
certainly has the power to open the courtroom 
to the massive number of Americans who want 
to tand behind their brave sister. Angela

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
No choice 
on Jensen 

Dear Editor : 
Much as I hate to contribute 

to the vast wasteland 
surrounding the Jensen 
controversy. I mu t write this 
letter. one which would have 
been unnecessary had the man 
himself been allowed to speak 
at the Salk Institute. Instead. 
demonstrators disrupted the 
meeting. silencing not only 
Profes or Jensen. but also 
thCJse who might have 
disagreed with him . It wa 
useless. of course . for the 
demonstrators to try to justify 
their action by telling me the 
flaws in Jen en 's publIshed 
work. How much better to have 
suc h flaws exposed 
publi c ly- the audience 
contained cholars sufficli!n to 
do the ta k- or better. to 
disc over that pel haps 

Professor Jensen himself ha 
begun to alter his views. There 
have been many publi hed 
critiques of hiS work . 
some-not all-of them have 
been penetra ting. rigourous 
and effective. For Professor 
Jensen not to modify hi s 
conclusions would consign him 
to a well-deserved oblivion of 
mediocre scholarship. But we 
were not permitted to hear 
what he had to say. 

Student demonstration s . 
where they have a roused and 
informed public opinion. are 
part of an honorable 
democratic heritage But the 
muffling of Professor Jensen 
wa quite the oppo ite. The 
audience wa filled with people 
who knew wha t the i sues 
were . Presumably. they 
wanted to know what to make 
of them. What was so dreary 
about the stunt at the alk was 
that It wa so mindle sly 
Imitative. so void of meaning . 
so crass. like a Hollywood 

sequel. Son of Sit-In. A few 
Ii ttle league posta I clerks were 
there to keep our minds from 
being exposed to bad 
influences. 

One of the demonstra tors I 
poke to later seemed at least 

persuadable that they might 
have blown it. Another one 
seemed to have hi s head 
located somewhere on his hip 
and just kept shooting cliches 
at me. I hope he doesn 't end up 
running the post office where I 
live. 

Last year at Stanford I 
taught a course entitled 
" Genes and ociety" and 
invited Professor William 
Shockley. a spiritual confrere 
of Jensen. to join us at one 
session. Professor Shockley 
arrived . complete with tape 
recorders and his band of 
myrmidons. some of whom 
seemed to become a bit 
un ettled . perhaps even 
co nverted during the 
discu slon. when they aw their

The D raft 

A merican Roulette 
Lan ce B e izer 

The draft allects almost all students on 
this campus, whether male or female . 'n 
this column , shall attempt to answer 
questions you may have about the in-
tricacies of the selective service system 
and the mechanics of lottery, deferment, 
conscientious objection, etc. Send your 
inquiries to me in Bldg. 250 Matthews 
campus or call extension 1945. 

Q. EXACTLY WHAT IS A CONSCIENTIOUS 
OBJECTOR AND HOW CAN I BECOME ONE? 
A_ There are two classifications of C.O. They are 

1~ and I·A.o. U you fall into the first you object 
to serving in the army. U you are 1-A-O you 
object only to bearing arms and are therefore 
draftable into the army, though you would serve 
normally in a capacity like that of medic. If your 
draft board grants you a 1.0, you will be required 
to serve two years of alternative service in a 
civilian capacity for a non-profit organization 
whose work is deemed to be in the interest of 
humanity. The work may range from driving a 
truck for Goodwill to working with a missionary 
group in a foreign country. 

The recent Supreme Court ruling in Welsh v. 
United States expanded the possible grounds 
which can qualify a registrant for classification 
as a conscientious objector. You must be op-
posed to participation in all wars, not merely one 
or some. You must be so opposed as a result of 
deeply-held moral or spiritual convictions. 
Previously, you must have been willing at least 
to call yourself religious. Now, however, even if 
you say you are a confirmed atheist you may still 
qualify. 

Four Questions Require Answers 
The form which you must fill out (SS Form 

150) contains four questions. Essentially these 
are: 1) What do you believe ; 2) Where does this 
belief come from; 3) Do you object to serving as 
a medic; and 4) Have you ever expressed your 
belief? If so, how and where? The form also asks 
for the names of five references . Answers to the 
four questions may vary tremendously in length 
from a few lines to several pages. The quality, 
not the quantity, is the important criterion. You 
should try as best as possible to give gut-level 
answers to the questions, instead of academic 
rhetoric . 

Although you may enter the names of 
references on the form, the board won't contact 
the people listed. You must procure these letters 
yourself. It is best not to limit yourself to five . 
Again, however. Quality is more important than 
quantity. The best letter would be from an older 
member of the establishment who has Imown 
,both your parents and you for a number of years 
and who can say that although he disagrees with 
your position, he is convinced of your sincerity 
and integrity. 

Parental Letters Help 
Be sure to include letters from parents. Their 

presence may not do much for you; their ab-
sence, though, may be disastrous since it may 
lead board members to whether your parents 
believe you. If you file a Form 150 and submit 
letters of recommendation, but all you receive 
for your efforts is a l·A classification card don 't 
be dismayed_ It is almost always necessa'ry for 
you to request a personal appearance and 
convince the board of your sincerity in person in 
order to win"the 1.0. 
Q. I HAD A 208 STUDENT CLASSIFICATION 
LAST SCHOOL YEAR BUT IT EXPIRED IN 
OCTOBER, 1970. HOWEVER, I HAVEN'T 
RECEIVED ANY RECLASSIFICATION THIS 
YEAR. F WAS BORN IN 1950, AND MY RAN-
DOM SEQUENCE NUMBER IS 150. NOW THAT 
IT IS 1971, HAS MY YEAR OF PRIME 
LIABILITY PASSED SINCE I WAS NOT AP· 
PARENTL Y DEFERRED O~ DECEMBER 31? 
A. No. You are still liable. Your question raises 
two points. First, you are not in fact in the 
draftable pool until your board actually classi-
fies you I-A (or I·A-O) at one of its monthly 
meetings. 'ThUS, although your 2-S has expired, 
you are not yet eligible for induction until you 
have received a l·A classification and have 
passed your appeal period. If that happens in 
1971 , you will have to wait to see how far the 
lottery goes this year, and 150 will probably be 
near this year's limit. 

Second, if you had received a I-A on, let us say, 
December 10, you would be in the extended 
priori ty group rather than the secondary grouJ: 
since your number had been passed in 1970, and 
unless you get another deferment or fail your 
physical you will undoubtedly be drafted when 
your appeals have been exhausted.

Dear Editor : 

In a lelter in last Tuesday's 
T'I' Chuck Rose offered a 
critic ism of my article on 
Marcuse. The latter half of his 
letter dealt with hi s view of 
Jesus. a belief which is beyond 
my power to shake through 
writing so I will not try. 

His first para grap h, 
however, ( can deal with on a 
rational level. H makes the 
statement. in critizism of my 
logiC. that -"The eparation of 
secular ideology and action is 
not defined ." The answer to 
this accusatIOn is that there is 
no eparation between theory 
and practice. A theory is an 
expres ion of an ideal , an 
outline of right action leading 
to an expressed goal. Once you 
set up an ideal system of action 
you should never deviate from 
it ince. according to your 
Ideal . any other action wou ld 
be less than the best. If your 
results do not come out as you 
would like them to . you should

The Tritons easily defeated the University of Hawaii at Hilo in 
an exceptionally hlgh-scoring contest last Friday night. The 
home team scored 107 points to the visitors' 68 for their second 
victory over the HawaUan team this year. 

UCSD started the game with a full-court press defense and a 
run-and-gun offense that built up a l0-p0int lead five minutes 
into the game. The University of Hawaii Vulcans cut the lead 
down to seven points, but were unable to get any closer and by 
halftime had fallen back by 24 points. Mercifully, the UCSD 
coach, Barry Cunningham, called off the full court press for the 
second half, but the Vulcans were still plagued by poor shooting 
and frequent turnovers. At the same time the Tritons had a hot 
hand in shooting, hitting 48 per cent from the floor , and were 
able to take advantage of the opponent's many mistakes for 
easy baskets. 

Sophomore guard Jon Lelevier and senior Brian Todd shared 
high point honors for the game, each hitting for 22 points . Steve 
Hoch, Dave Gregory, Scott Wright, and Jeff Carlisle also scored 
in double figures for the Tritons. Jim Evans, the Vulcan center, 
was high scorer for the Hawaiians. In between numerous 
traveling violations he managed to drop in 15 points. Both Todd 
and Evans were high scorers for their respective teams in their 
first meeting, over Christmas vacation. In that game, held 
during the Tritons' Hawaiian road trip, UCSD also won by a 
score of 97 to 67. 

Despite their team's poor showing, the Hawaiian cheerleaders 
provided the spectators with an entertaining half time show of 
native Hawaiian dances and musIc. The crowd reacted with 
greater applause at this time than they did at any time during 
the game. 

In a rather lackluster contest the following night, the junior 
varsity team defeated the varsity of Life College 75 to 44. The 
game was notable only for the amount of physical contact that 
occurred during play. Although a great number of violations 
were missed, the referees still managed to call 42 personal fouls 
during the course of the game. Though the Tritons were not 
playing one of their better games of the season, they managed to 
dominate most of the game. Forward Tom Bruce of UCSD led 
all scorers with 18 points and was followed by Rich Long and 
Steve Tolle of Life College who scored 16 and 15 points respec-
tively. Triton guard Malcolm King also tallied for 13 points .

OPERATION SURVIVAL 

THE SELL-OUT OF THE AGES 

After enumera ting the assets of the North American 
Continent and the unprecedented HIGH STA DARD OF 
LIVING FOR ALL AMERICA S we could accomplish by 
intelligent SCIE TIFIC DISTRIBUTION of what we were 
even then able to SCIENTIFICALLY PRODUCE (back in 
1933 ) - Howard Scott. Technocracy's top man invited 
America 's Financial, Industrial and Political leadership to 
VOLUNTARILY and INTELLIGENTLY convert 
America 's out-dated. antiquated Political Prace System 10 
a TECHNOLOGICAL GOVERNANCE OF FUNCTION. 

The blue-prints were ready . trained scientists and 
Tpchnicians were available. The transition could have 
been made in a short time 

An abundance of all vital Goods and Services would not 
only be available to every man. woman and child in orth 
America- but this Continent would be immune to military 
attack by CONTI ENTAL DEFENSE SYSTEM and an 
INTERNAL UNITY far ahead of Its time! 

Scott also warned America 's Leadership that. even then 
137 years ago) we were fast approaching zero in our use of 
HUMAN ENERGY. and that as Human Energy was 
replaced by Machine Energy. our PURCHASING POWER 
would likewise decline (under the obsolete Price System ): 
unemployment. relief and welfare would increase until the 
System self-destructed under the impact of the 
consumption of 200,000 k c per capita per day. 

What happened? Did America 's Financial , Industrial 
and Political Leadership listen carefully, investigate and 
verify the fi ndings and recommendations of America 's top 
men of Science (who toad just accurately predicted the 
Market Crash of 1929 30 nearly ten years ahead of its 
occurrence I' 

They did not! After discovering that Technocracy and its 
Leadership "were not for sale" and could neither be 
bought nor intimidated. America 's Polilical. Industrial 
and Financial Leadership did their level best to "outlaw 
Technocracy"-and laid the groundwork for World War II. 
and another fast buck! 

That. Boys and Girls. is the Heritage left you by your 
parents and grandparents. back in 1933. You have been 
living on the "benefits" of this ever since. wh ich have 
been :-

Three more Wars I World War II. Korea &< Viet 
Naml-
A National Debt of $350 Billion with 69 percent of this 
principal due in 3 years and an annual Interest

4106 million unemployed at all times-
12' J million people on welfare at present-
50.000 Americans killed EVERY YEAR on our 
highways-
Crime at an ali-lime high. and increasing each year-
Dope now 10 our High Schools and grade schools-
Air. Water and Soil Pollution momentarily threaten 
our survlval-
A rendezvous w,th our self-destructing Price System 
10 th Immediate future , when our use of Machine-
