AIDS Walk Demonstrates Popularity of HIV-Awareness 
CONTROVERSY: 
Needle exchange 
sparks political debate 
By Mary Hlalns 
Associate News Editor 

Unlike the 19805, when many 
considered "AIDS" a dirty word, 
events promoting HIV/AIDS-
awareness have become politically 
correct in the nineties - or so ~ 
seemed Sunday morning at the sixth 
annual San Diego AIDS Walk in

Representatives of the Catholic 

HIV I AIDS Ministry were presentto

accept dona-
tions for those 
infected with AIDS Walk 

raised between $550,000 and 
$600,000 to support local AIDS 
foundations and other service pro-
viders. 

Between 13,000 and 14,000 
people of different genders, races, 
re~gions, political affiliations, ages 
and sexual orientations registered to 

the virus. 
Members ofthe mainstream me-

dia were also on hand, including a 
KGTV voter-registration desk and 
music by QI06-FM. 

The Girl Scouts were at the walk 
for the second year in a row, passing 
ouCgift bags to those participants 

who crossed the finish line. 
According to Nielan Barnes, 

AIDS Walk Media and Communi-
cations Relations Coordinator, the 
walk grows in popularity every year. 

"People ... have been opening 
their minds, opening their hearts," 
Barnes said. 

Barnes said the AIDS Walk isn't 
as likely these-days to attract oppo-
sition, because HIV is increasingly 
infecting a more diverse sector of 
the population.

WHAT KIND OF BIRD ARE yOU? 



the 

Proposed Bill 
Failed To 
Protect 
Women's Health 
By Patrie'. Ch_. 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Of all the attacks that pro-life supporters 
have launched against abortion, none have 
been as insupportable and unwarranted as the 
recent wave of propaganda issued to rebut 
President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act. 

The issue of partial-birth abortion re-
emerged in September after the House voted 
to override President Clinton's veto of the 
act. About a week ago, the Senate, by a 
vote of 57-41, fell short of the two-thirds 
majority needed to override the veto. 

rntroduced by Charles T. Canady, R-
Fla., the act was the first in 
Congressional history to bar a specific 
abortion procedure. Pro-lifers claim that 
the practice in question, technically 
knQwn as intact dilation and extraction, 
is mostly used for women in their third 
trimester of pregnancy, even though 
most take place during the second 
trimester (before 26 weeks into the 
pregnancy). 

The abortion is performed by grab-
bing the baby's feet with forceps and 
pulling the baby out through the birth 
canal except for its head. The skull is 
then collapsed with scissors and the brain 
suctioned for easier extraction. 

Under the bill, physicians would face 
up to $200,000 in fines or two years in 
prison for performing a partial-birth abor-
tion, unless the procedure were "necessary 
to save the life of a mother whose life [was] 
endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or 
injury." 

Since the House voted to override 
Clinton's veto, associations such as the 
National Right to Life Corrtmillee and 
Catholics United for Life have set out to gar-
ner upport for the bill. They have used stories 
such as "What the Nurse Saw" to describe the 
emotions nurses supposedly experience when 
they witness abortions. They Jlave posted pic-
tures of fetuses piled in garbage bags to reveal 
the "consequences" of abortion. They have 
declared that "the difference between partial-
abortion and homicide is three inches." 

Such false claims and emotional appeals

PINION 
President 
Clinton's 
Veto Played 
Only to 
Pro-Choice 
Extremists 
By Nat. PIetIla 
Opinion Editor 

If the debate over partial-birth abortions 
shows anything, it is that extremism is not limit-

ed to the pro-life side of the abortion issue. 
Consider and visualize, for a moment, the 

reality of the procedure known as intact 
dilation and ex!raction. A baby · is partially 
delivered feet first until only its head 

remains inside the birth canal. Then a sharp 
instrument, typically surgical scissors, are 

forced into the baby's head at the base of the 
skull. An opening is created, and then the baby's 
brain is suetioned out. 

This is a terribly brutal, utterly horrifying 
procedure. Even Sen. Daniel Patrick 

Moynihan, a pro-choice Democrat from 
New York, called it "as close to infanticide 
as anything I've come upon." 

Incredibly, President Clinton vetoed a 
recent bill that would have banned this

percentage of the 15,000

formed each year are per-
formed using intact dila-
tion and extraction, we 
have to remember that we 
are talking about human 
lives here. No matter what 
the exact number of par-
tial-birth abortions actual-
ly perfonned, we should 
all recognize that this is a 
gruesome procedure. 

Even if the bill Clinton vetoed were, as is 
commonly claimed, to save only 600 late-term 
fe tuses from being slaughtered each year, 
shouldn't we nevertheles insist that we should 
stop any such shocking activity from occurring? 

An overwhelming majority of Americans, [ 
think, find partial-birth abortion to be horrific 
and wrong. Nevertheless, there seems to be a 
general reluctance (particularly on the part of the 
mainstream media) to publicly express horror at 
the brutality of the procedure. Enthralled by the 
lypically abstract arguments employed by pro-
choicers, we no longer allow ourselves to see 
ncts of brutality as they are. 

And it definitely seems curious to base our 
social policy (especially policy concerning the 
most contentious social issue of our time -
abortion) on abstruse and abstract arguments 
about human rights and the status of the fetus as 
a person, when anyone who sees the procedure

TAX FORUM WAS A FARCE 
Editor: 

I was disappointed by your cov-
erage of the Republican townhall 
meeting ('The Ultjmate Outsider," 
Sept. 30, 1996). According to the 
article, the purpose of the meeting 
was to discuss Bob Dole's proposed 
15 percent federal lax cut. It would 
be more accurate to say that the 
meeting, as well as the article, were 
intended to promote Bob Dole's 
platfonn. If the proposed tax cut 
were really discussed and if the arti-
cle were objective, there should 
have been some discussion of the 
reasons why not everyone is so 
enthusiastic about this platform. 

The final sentence of the anicle 
was the following quote from 
Howard Kaloogian: "Tax cuts help 
everybody." Pretty powerful state-
ment. But is this really true? 
According to the article, this trans-
lates into a tax cut of $1,684 for the 
average California family. Bob Dole 
claims that it will enable mothers 
who would rather not work to stay 
home with their children. On what 
planet is $1 ,684 a year enough to 
allow a parent to choose not to 
work? 

Who does this tax cut really ben-
efit? People who make hundreds of 
thousands of dollars a year (or even 
millions) are in the highest tax 
bracket. A 15 percent tax cut for 
such a person who pays $100,000 a 
year in federal taxes translates into a 
return of about $15,000 a year! That 
is more than millions of hard-work-
ing Americans have to live on in a

year. So in fact, Ihis proposed tax 
cut gives the average California 
family about $140 a month, but 
gives the more fortunate an addi-
tional $1 ,250 or more (much much 
more in some ca~es) a month. 
Equitable? 

J just graduated from UCSD in 
August and am now working 40 
hours per week. This enables me to 
see more of my hard-earned money 
taken out in taxes than ever before. 
If I had no social conscience, this 
might bother me a great deal. But 
the fact is, I am aware that taxes 

aren 't all bad. 
We need roads. We need health 

care for our elderly. We want our 
chi ldren to receive a quality educa-
tion. We want higher education to be 
accessible to all those who are qual-
ified (not just those whose parents 
can afford it). Without taxes there 
would be no military, no federally 
sponsored research and no federal 
tudent aid (among many other 

things). 
Of course if you are rich, you can 

afford private schools and private 
health insurance, and your children 
won't need financial aid and will be 
much less likely to join the military. 
The extremes of wealth and poverty 
in America today are disgusting. 
And the Republican agenda will 
only widen this gap. rr you think we 
all have "equal opportunity," you 
should read Savage Inequalities by 
Jonathan Kozol for starters. 

Bob Dole's 15 percent federal 
tax cut will essentially take money 
away from the services that benefit 
the least fortunate and put it back in 
the hands of the most fortunate (and 
powerful). I urge anyone who thinks 
Bob Dole's ideas will "help every-
body" to do some research. When 
Bill Clinton says we "can't afford a 
15 percent federal tax cut," it is 
because the ramifications of such a 
tax cut would be unacceptable to 
anyone who has an ounce of social 
conscienc .

RIGHTS: 
Continued from pace 4 
for what it is considers it horrific 
and wrong. 

Perhaps more importantly, we 
need to remember that the 
Constitution, the basis of our polit-
ical sy tem, was not predicated 
upon protecting and enshrining 
personal choice at all co ts. To say 
thai we should respect another 
per on's choice regardless of 
whether it 's right or wrong is to 
abandon the cause of protecting a 
vast array of human rights. 

We, as a society, are for the 
most part eager to protect individ-
uals from coercion resulting from 
other people's choices. For exam-
ple, we do not think that a parent 
has the right to raise his Jr her 
children in such a way that entails 
regular phrsical abuse. Tl.erc are 
legal limits - limits backoo up by 
the power of the stale - on what 
constitutes proper behavior by a 
parent toward his or her chi Idren. 

The truth be told, I will readily 
admit that I don't have a non-reli-
gious argument to bolster my 
claim that abortion at any point 
during pregnancy is wrong. At the 
same time, however, I think we 
can all at least agree that there is 
little or no di fference between 
killing a baby a week before it is 
born - whether it is defonned or 
not - and killing a baby two days 
after its birth. So at what point 
does the abortion issue become 
contentious? We need to deter-
mine when a fetus becomes a 
right-possessing human being. 

Since babies in the third 
trimester are typically able to sur-
vive outside of the womb, it seems 

OPINION 5 

natural to conclude that third-
tri mester fetuses have a right 10 
life. Thus it seems that any - not 
just partial-birth - abortions per-
formed during this late stage are 
unjustified. Thus is the partial-
birth abortion ban justified. 

So~e would assert that partial-
birth abortions may be necessary 
to save the mother's life. 
However, just as pro-lifers have 
failed to produce a single Instance 
of a late-tenn abortion where Ihe 
mOlher 's life or health was not 
threatened and the Ictus was not 
deformed, so too have pro·choice 
forces failed to produce a case in 
which a late·term, partial-birth 
abortion procedure was medically 
necessary. 

But even if it were necessary, 
what right do we human have to 
play God? Suppose someone were 
in immanent danger of drowning 
and that the only way to save him 
would be to throw an innocent 
bystander, who would ultimately 
drown because he couldn't swim, 
into the water 10 save his life. I 
think we would all agree that 10 
sacrifice this person for someone 
else would be morally wrong. 

Such is the case with abortion. 
Given that a Ictus in the third 
trimester has righls (thi shouldn 't 
be too controversialY, the mother 
has no right 10 kill the fetus even if 
her own life is in danger. She like-
wise has no right to kill the fetus if 
only her health is in danger. 

It is truly amazing that there is 
any controversy surrounding the 
proposed ban on partial-birth 
abortions. It shows just how far we 
have come since Roe v. Wade 
along the road thai leads to "infan-
ticide."

CLAIMS: 
Pro-lifers play loose 
with statistics 
Continued from pea. 4 
are hardly reason for anyone to 
support an anti -abortion measure. 
Apparently pro-lifers aren't doing 
their research when they claim 
that half of the 1.5 million abor-
tions performed per year in the 
United States use intact dilation. 

The ",Ian Guttmacher Institute, 
reports that only 15,000 abortions 
per year occur after 20 weeks of 
pregnancy. Of this number, only 
600 of these take place after 26 
weeks, and only a small percent-
age of these 600 are performed 
using intact dilation . 

So why isn' t Congress outlaw-
ing more commonly used forms of 
abortion? The answer is, simply, 
that they just haven ' t had time yel. 
As one abortion activist so aptly 
put it in a leiter to the New York 
Times, the Canady bill is. in effect, 
"the first shot in a campai,gn by 
anti -abortion forces to erode 
access to abortion by banning one 
procedure after another." 

In other words, anti -abortion-
ists are hoping to out law all form 
of abortion in the future by ban-
ning one form of abortion now. 
Had Clinton 's veto been overrid-
den. the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act would have been used as 
a precedent to ban all abortion 
procedures. 

However, if anti -abortioni ts 
want to ban abortion altogether. 
they need to develop stron ger 
arguments to support their posi-
tion. Many of them cry that the 
lives of babies are at stake. and 

that women who need abortions 
are selfishly obtaining them only 
for economic or other practical 
reasons. 

It is true that many women 
obtain abortions for personal , not 
medical, reasons. Yet. who can 
deny that we all have the right to 
choose what we want to do for 
ourselves? 

Pro-lifers who declare that God 
could not forgive the act of abor-
tion, forget that God gave Adam a 
choice whether or not to eat from 
the Tree of Life. Although Adam 
chose a rouen lifestyle, God did 
not interfere with his choice. We 
likewise should not interfere with 
the right of a woman to choose 
whether or not to end her pregnan-
cy. 

The National Right to Life 
Commillee claims that "docu-
ments obtained by the 
Congressional committees show 
that the overwhelming majority of 
partial-birth abortions are not done 
for any medical reasons [sic] at 
aIL" 

They insist that most partial-
bi rth abortions are purely electi ve. 
In reality, however, most partial 
abortions are performed only on 
severely deformed fet uses. 
Allowing the baby to remain with-
in the womb would endanger the 
mother's hea lth. With this in mind, 
what wou ld constitute elective? 
What choice does the mother 
have? None at all. 

The director of the National 
Abortion Federation, Vi cki 
Sapona, has' found that. " ei ther 
the pro-choice nor anti -choice 
organizations tloing bailie over the 
issue have found any evidence that 
elective abortions are being per-

Monday, October 7, 1996 

formed on viable fetuses." 
Seen in- a different light, the 

controversy surrounding the 
Partial-Birth Abortion San Act is 
an election-year attempt to attack 
President Clinton. Many pro-lifers 
have accused him of "infanticide." 
The fact of the mailer is that 
Clinton agreed to adopt the mea-
ure if the bill would not only pro-

tect the life, but also the health of 
the mother. 

Pro-Ii fers argue that the term 
"health" is too ambiguous a term. 
After the president's speech 
defending the veto, several Roman 
Catholic cardinals wrote to the 
president asking him to explain 
what he meant by the difference 
between a "health exception" and 
"serious adverse effects." 

By raising this issue in their 
leIter the cardinals revealed anoth-
er weakness in the Canady mea· 
sure: It leaves too much interpreta-
tion to the courts. It would clearly 
be impossible for the courts to 
avoid conflicts over interpretation 
if they were called upon to draw 
the fi ne line between risk to health 
and risk to life endangered by a 
physical disorder, illness, or 
injury. 

What the issue of part ial abor-
tion boils down to is the same 
question present in all other dis-
cussions of abortion : the conflict 
between the li fe of a new child and 
the right of a woman to choose the 
direction of her li fe . 

We will never really reach a 
consensus on this issue. and the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act 
does not furt her the debate 
because it fails to address the real 
issues facing women in our coun-
try.

INITIATIVE: 
Program would push 
distance-learning 
Continued from pace 1 
mulated plans aboul certain aspects 
of the Internet University. 

The program \\-ill ~ multifac-
eted and available to studen.s·across 
the globe. Different campuses 
within the UC, CSU and Commu-
nity College systems, as well as 
private schools, can participate and 
offer courses on-line. 

Each campus will decide which 
courses to offer and how the on-line 
courses will be incorporated into 
students ' regular coursework. This 
arrangement allows campuses to 
customize the program to fit both 
students ' needs and the institution's 
educational phi losophy. Courses 
will alsobeavailableto professional 
students in other countries. 

Regardless of how the design 
team decides the program should 
operate, Rodota said that the pro-
gram will not offer students "a four-
year degree through a computer." 
Individual campuses will still grant 
degrees, to control quality in a way 
that computers cannot. 

According to Wilson, the CSU 
system enrolls more than 14,500 
students in distance-education 
courses, while ~tanford University 
provides televised engineering in-
struction and grants degrees to stu-
dents as far away as Connecticut. 

UC Presidenl Richard Atkinson 
released a sialement supporting 
Wilson's decision. 

"At the University of Cali fomi a, 
one of our top priorities is to c0n-
tinue our world leadership in the 
use of technology to enrich aod 
improve the leamingellperience that 
we provide to students," said 
Atkinson. 

CSU Chancellor Barry ~unitz 
also praised the Governor's deci-
sion. 

'The California State Univer-
sity is delighted that the governor 
has assumed leadership in bringing 
together our hig.her education seg-
ments to design California's ver-
sion of a virtual university," said 
Munitz. "We appreciate particularly 
the governor's confidence in 
California's established, accredited 

. institutions, which have well recog-
nized, worldwide reputations for 
quality." 

~unitz added that such .a pro-
gram could also bring financial ben-
efits to the state. 

"We welcome the opportunity to 
work with our colleagues in imple-
menting a model of cooperation that 
would serve the needs of Cali fomia 
and its rising student enrollments, 
while demonstrating that we can do 
business differently. Such an effort 
would ... permit us to expand the 
reach o f all of our institutions out-
side Ihe slate and nation and thereby 
generate revenues for education in 
Californ ia," he; said. 

Rodota was unable 10 provide a 
speci ll c timetable for the project, 
but he said the design team plans to 
" move aggressive ly" to get the pro-
gram underway.

WALK

needle exchanges would be condon-
ing drug use. 

"I don ' t condone ... or promote 
drug use," said Whilteker, who is 
also an employee of the UCSD psy-
chiatry department. "[When we go 
out into the neighborhoods] we ask: 
What ean we do to help you get off 
of drugs? But if you're not going to 
get off of drugs, then be educated 
about using clean needles." 

Despite reports showing that dis-
tributing clean needles may indeed 
slow the spread of H1V, Exchange 
workers arc not always popular -
even among HIVactivists. 

One volunteer was concerned 
that Exchange proponents were 
allempting to capitalize off the AIDS 
Walk 's popularity LO promote their 
program. 

Whilteker disagreed. 
"To say that we're piggybacking 

off of the AIDS Walk is bull hit," he 
said. 'We're part of it. We're fifty-
percent of the issue." 

Some people feel that because of 
the new "P.c." altitude towards 
AIDS awarene s, the level of 
activism has declined in recem 
years. 

" It seems like S.D. is bum-ed out 
in terms of enthusiasm," Warren 
senior Marcus Fong said. " I've 
done these walks in San Francisco 
and Los Angeles, and there is defi-
nitely a community feeling [in 
those cities]." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Fong, who has panicipated in the 
AIDS Walk ~ r the last five years. is 
a Leaching assistant for Professor Ian 
Trowbridgc 's SILO 36 (AIDS for 
Non-Biologists) class. 

Fong added that while dozens of 
UCSD students turned out to the 
event, they didn ' t march together as 
a team. 

"UCSD definitcly was lacking in 
unity," he said. 'There were a ton or 
them there but they weren't walking 
as a group." 

Controversial or "P.C.," young or 
old, individual or team erfon, there 
was one factor that brought all Lhe 
contributors to the AIDS walk 
together - promotion of HIV-
awarenes . 

"At every one of these booths, 
these people are dealing with 
AIDS," said Whilleker.

The UCSD Guardian 

While CUC$c;{) might appear 
relatively safe, it is important for 
students to take safety precautions 
_ .. "'-

alking alone at night is 
increasingly taxing on 
the consciousness of 
many UCSD students. 

Upon hearing the reports of 
recent violent crimes 
committed on campus, both 
students and faculty are 
beginning to question campus 
safety. 

However, according to 
crime prevention officer Alan 
Jenkins, the issue is not a 
matter of whether UCSD is a 
generally safe campus since 
"no one is immune to crime. II 
Rather, campus safety is as 
much an individual's 
responsibility as it is the duty 
of the police dep3rtment and 
other law enforcement 
agencies. 

Jenkins warned against 
students "falling into the trap 
of either obsessing with crime 
or ignoring it." 

'-n.ere are two ends of the 
spectrum," he said. 
"One end says 
'Why worry 

about using common sense or 
crime prevention since nothing 
happens at UCSD?' The other 
end says that crime is rampant. 
Neither end is true." 

UC crime statistics show 
that the rate of crime at UCSD 
is not as high as those of other 
UC campuses. Jenkins said 
that com pari ng rates is not an 
efficient way of measuring 
safety on campus because each 
campus carries different 
"variables. II 

"At Davis, for example, 
there are two bikes per person 
and so the rate of bicycle theft 
is going to be greater than 
those of other campuses," he 
said. 

Jenkins said UCSD is a 
"relatively safe" campus, and 
its location in the heart of La 
JQlla has probably helped to 
keep the level of Clime down. 

"But if you 
placed UCSD in 

downtown San 
Diego, the 
crime rate is 
most. likely 

going to go up," 
Jenkins said. "But 

just because it is in 
La Jolla does not 
mean that there is 
absolutely no crime 
at all. At any given 

day, there are 
approximatel y 

30,000 people 

on campus." 
Car Theft 

Jenkins stressed the 
importance of arming cars with 
security devices. 

"Nine out of 10 car thefts 
occur when the car owner has 
not taken security measures," 
Jenkins said. "We all need to 
take responsibility on 
ourselves. The security devices 
can range from $39 to $200." 

However, having an 
elaborate security system does 
not guarantee that your car will 
not be stolen. 

"If the thief is motivated and 
detennined to steal the car, he's 
going to steal it," Jenkins said. ' 
"But that does not mean that 
you should not take measures 
to protect your car. The devices 
can possibly serve as a 
psychological deterrent to the 
thief." 

Contrary to popular belief, 
Jenkins warned that the 
chances that older cars get 
stolen are not necessarily 
lower. 

"The majority of cars stolen 
are cars that no one thinks 
would be stolen,'" Jenk i'1s said. 
"Old cars have valuable pll rt~ 
that thieves can strip an d 
[resell] . "

J(nowledge, 
application of 
martial arts

to be usgLll 
for those il1 
threatening· situatio/1s 

C D student , alone and 
walking to the car late on 
a foggy night after an 
evenin g of hitting the 

books, hears footsteps 
following behind her in the 
mist. Given the recent attacks 
on students and property here at 
UCSD, she has every right to 
be apprehensive as to who 
could be approaching her and 
what he might want. If 
unprepared, the only option 
available to her is to quicken 
her pace and hope that either 
the person is harmless or that 
help is nearby. . 

If, however, she has taken 
the time to prepare for this kind 
of situation, she can be 
confident in her abi lity to 
handle the problem and her 
knowledge of what to do to 
avoid trouble altogether. From 
training with and carrying 
pepper spray to studying one of 
the various hands-on self-
defense methods available, 
there are a plethora of ways for 
a student to take control of her 
own personal safety. 

Most self-defense methods 
are rooted in martial-art.

marti al-arts systems are deri ved

to East Asia by way of India. 
Methods range from those 
based in spiritual energy and 
forms such as aikido to those 
based purel y upon street 
fighting and reacting to attack 
situations such as krav maga. 

There are two school s of 
fighting that, although not 
mutually exclusive, do tend to 
focu s on two different and 
distinct strategies of combat. 
First, there are the striking arts. 
Striking strategies involve 
keeping an attacker at a 
distance from one's body by 
utilizing various strikes such as 
punches, kicks, elbows, knees 
and head-butts. Fighting 
systems classified as "arts" 
tend to employ striking 
strategies and practice highly-
stylized forms to imbed 
reactions '" practitioners' 
reflexes. 

Striking systems generate 
from two schools: karate and 
boxing/kick-boxing. Arts such 
as kung fu , shoto khan and 

taekw ndo are similar to karate 
in fo rm . Thai-boxing, muy thai, , 
and vari ous types of Filipino 
kick-boxing belong to the kick-
boxing school. Krav maga -
the fi ghting method developed 
for Israeli special forces and 
taught to U.S. law enforcement 
personnel - is based on street 
fighting skills and maneuvers 
that quickl y switch from 
defensive reactions to offensive 
strikes. 

The second major school of 
fighting is comprised of 
techniques broadly classified as 
grappling arts. In contrast to 
striking, the goal of a grappler 
is to keep the attacker close to 
his body. The grappler can then 
utilize various choke or 
submission holds to neutralize 
the attacker's threat. The choke 
holds render the attacker 
unconscious within seconds 
and the submission holds 
utilize leverage to break bones 
and/or to tear ligaments and 
tendons.

Championships" or any of its

Do You THINK UCSD Is A SAFE CAMPUS? 
Interviews by Dan Sweeney • Photography by Alii Macisaac 

I think the area we live 
in [La Jolla] is a lot more 
secure than where most 
campuses are. Since I 
haven 't seen a lot of [crim-
inal] stuff going on, securi-
ty must be doing some-
thing right. 

Rich Brown 
Muir Senior 

J think the campus is 
pretty safe because people 
have access to CSO's. It's 
something everyone is 
aware of. There were a 
couple of instances last 
year with the attempted 
rapes, so people are aware 
that they can be a problem. 
People are aware they 
have access to that num-
ber, and I think people 
make use of it.

Yeah, though in some 
places the lights aren't 
working sometimes at 
night, and it's pretty dark 
around there - like 
around the walk towards 
Peterson, in front of the 
library. I ee CSO's walk-
ing around a lot at night, 
so I think it's pretty secure 
in that way. 

Sunlt H._. 
Warren Senior 

I think it's fairly secure. 
I work for shuttle services 
and we' re always out there 
looking around and report-
ing things [that appear sus-
picious]. When I work 
night shifts J always see 
cops around.

ATTACK: 
. Techniques provide 
victims agency 
Continued from paCe 13 
derivati ves is aware of the 
grappling strategy. Royce Gracie 
popularized the Brazilian jiu-jitsu 
grappling ty le in the V .S. while 
earning mult iple Uhimate-Fighting 
crowns. 

In addition to Brazilian jiu-j itsu, 
there are many other fig hting 
sy tem based on grappling 
principles. Judo, Japanese jiu-ji tsu, 
sambo (simi lar to greco-roman 
wre tling, but utilizes more 
submissions and chokes) and 
hopkido are among the grappling 
styles available 10 students learning 
self-defense techn iques. 

The legendary Bruce Lee 
developed a system which 
inco rporated some of the be t 
moves of both thc grappling and 
stri king styles called jeet koon do. 
Unfortunately, it is ex tremely 
difficult to fi nd an instructor to 
teach this fo rm . 

However, this is not the case 
with the OIher aforement ioned 
techniques. In fact, there arc many 
places on ca mpu s and in the 
immediale vicinity where a studen t 
can receive training in se lf-defense 
techniques. 

Mu ltiple Iighting·style options 
are within easy reach of anyone 
who pi cks up a UCSD Recreation 
Magazine. Just a small sampling of 
the classes offered by UCSD 
RecClasses includes: aik ido, 
hopkido, Brazilian jiu·jitsu, judo, 
karate and taekwondo. For a small 
fee, students can avail themselves 
of the services of one of the many 
fi ne instructors offering classes at 
RIMAC. 

Off campus, the Lawrence 
Family Jewish Community Centers 
of San Diego are offering courses 
in krav maga that emphasize 
fighting ski lls and rape prevention. 
The class costs $89, plus an 
additional $9 registration fee for 
non·members. 

At Monteiro liu-jilsu Schoo l on 
Ji mmy Durante Boulevard in Del 
Mar, Professor Nelson Monteiro, a 
former Brazili an nali onal 
champion in Brazilian jiu·jitsu who 
stud ied under the Gracies, offers 
both group and pri vate classes in 
lighting and self·defense. Monteiro 
also offers an all-female class that 
addresses wo men's self-defense 
needs. Rales vary with the type of 
class that student may choose 10 
take .. 

The instructors from Monteiro 
Jiu-j itsu wi ll be offering a free sclf-
defense seminar and demonstration 
of Brazi li an jiu·jit u on campus 
later in the quaner. The seminar, to 
be sponsored by the Guardiall , will 
address the issues of rape and 
assaul t prevenlion. The Guardiall 
will carry more information about 
the date, time and location in future 
issues. 

Students can feel secure when 
walki ng by themselves late at night 
if they take the time to prepare 
themselves for as potentially 
dangerous situation. 

In the worst case scenario that a 
student suffers an attack - the 
student trained in immobi lizing an 
attacker and maki ng a quick escape 
will be far better off than the 
tudent that has not prepared 

herself for a dangerou situation. 
Do not be taken off·guard. Take the 
time to learn some self·defense 
techniques and prepare yourslef for 
a po sibly threatening situation, 
and you will be safer and fcel more 
secure and confident here at 
UCSD.

'TIPS: 
'Experts offer advice 
on crime prevention 
Continued from p.,. 12 
UCSD police. Jenkins said rape is 
the "most under-reported crime," 

According to Patty Choi, rape 
crisis counselor and legal advocate 
at the Center for Community 
Solutions, although 15 percent of 
college tudents are raped and one 
out of three college women are 
raped, 84 percent of rapes are not 
reported. Choi attributes this to 
society's problem of "double-
victimizing" the victim. 

"Society blames the victim," 
Choi said. "It asks, 'Why was she 
out at 3 a.m., why was she dressed 
that way.' But it does not mailer 
whether the woman was dressed 
provocatively, or that there was 
alcohol or that she invited you over. 
It doesn't even mailer that you are 
in her bedroom. If she says no, she 
means no. It's as simple as that." 

Choi stressed that rape is never 
about sex. 

"Rape is about power, control 
and domination," she said. " It is 
never the victim's fault. No one 
asks for rape and no one ha the 

"Trust your 
Instlnct .... 1f you , .. 1 
afraid ... there Is • 
reason you feel that 
way. Do not be 
afraid to hurt 
anyone's t .. llngs. If 
you feel 
uncomfortable, then 
yell at them to stop , 
following you. " 

-Patty Chol 
Rape Crisis Counselor 

right to humiliate a woman or to 
dominate her body." 

Choi added that rape is not 
merely an issue that concerns 
co llege women. 

"Rape happens in various 
communities," she said . "It 

h~ppens in the gay and lesbian 
communities, it happens to men, 
women, the elderly, children. It 
also occurs in every socioeconomic 
e1as , ethnic group, culture group 
and age group." 

According to Choi, 88 percent 
of rape victims know their 

" . 

The'UcSD CluMdian 

assai lants. She said the majority of 
rapes occur either within the home 
or when the victim is walking to his 
or her car. 

Choi also said that rapes are 
more likely to occur at ocial 
gatherings where alcohol 
consumption is prevalent. She 
warns students to be aware of 
Rohypnol (also known a "Ruffie" 
- the date-rape drug), a tastele , 
odorless drug that can render users 
unconscious. 

Shannon Chamberlain at the 
Student Safety Awareness Office 
said that although there is no "sure-
fire" way to prevent rape, students' 
best defense is to be aware. 
When Walking Alone at Night 

Chamberlain recommends that 
students who must walk alone at 
night should call a Campus Safety 
Officer (CSO) or police officer or 
meet up with a friend. 

Jenkins said students should 
walk in groups and avoid poorly-lit 
areas and shortcut paths that are not 
"well-beaten." 

Choi also offered several tips 
for students who must walk alone 
at night. 

"Although you cannot stop a 
rape and rape is never the victim's 
fault. you can prevent it," Choi 

said. "If you carry yourself in a 
certain way and walk with 
confidence, purpose and direction 
as opposed to meandering about, 
you can deter a crisis." 

"Let your feelings be your-
guide," she added. "Be aware of 
the time and distance from one 
destination to another. Know your 
options. If you are walking from 
the library to the ATM and you feel 
uncomfortable, for example, go to 
Espresso Roma." 

Choi advised that students 
should "trust their instincts." 

"If you fee l afraid, the chances 
are that there is a· reason you feel 
that way," Choi said. "Do not be 
afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If 
you fec i uncomfortable, then yell at 
them to stop following you."

FEATURES 11 

Chamberlain advises students to 
sleep with doors and windows 
locked, especially if they live on 
the ground tloors. She also 
recommend that students take 
self-defense workshops. 

Jenkins said that the UCSD 
Police Department sponsors 
workshops on the proper use of 
pepper spray. 
A Final Not. of Caution 

Jenkins advised students to be 
aware that they hav.e the potential 
to be victims. 

"Don't fall into the two 
misbe liefs," he said. "Although 
you should not ob ess over crime, 
you do have to be aware and take 
the necessary steps to take care of 
yourself. No one is immune to 
crime."

Seven is Magic, Again 
ROAD WARRIORS: Coach McManus' squad showed no mercy in dis-
pensing the Chapman University Panthers on their home field, 7-0 
By S •• n R.hlml 
Sports Editor 

For some unknown reason, the 
UCSD women's soccer leam likes 
the number seven. It could be that 
•• ~. seven is regarded as 

a lucky numberorbe-
cause it has a nice 
ring to it , but for 
whatever reason it 
has become a sym-
"'W!iW~ bol of the Tritons' 

domination over the ~~;,:;:- competition . 
For the third time this season, 

the Tritons notched se ven goals in 
a game en route to a 7-0 panking 
of Chapman University in Orange 
Count y last Friday ni ght. UCSD 
improved its record to 8- 1, record-
ing its eight shutout of the sea on. 

1-0 before the Chapman faithful 
could read their programs. 

"Playing on Iheir field is really 
tough," senior Kate Larsen said. 
"It ' s a 101 smaller and iI's a foot-
ball stadium - so the fans are 
loud . The difference this year is 
that we are finishing much better 
this year. Last year we had the 
same scoring chances, but we 
wouldn ' t finish ." 

Having quieled the crowd, the 
Tritons were smelling blood and 
went for the kill. Midfie'ld wonder 

Lauren Johnson, who did a little 
of everything, notched the next 
goal allhe 27:00 mark, swerving a 
Corner kick right into the back of 
the net. 

It was a busy night for Johnson, 
who also assisted on two corner 
kicks, scored on her own corner 
kick and scored two additional 
goals in the second half with low, 
booming kicks from about 25 
yards out. 

"Lauren is executing very well 
righl now," Larsen said. "She is 
hilling the corner ki cks well and 
the two goals she scored in the 
second half were awesome. She 
dri bbled past two people and 
blas ted it low past the keeper. " 

,-' ' 

Dominating the game 'at both 
ends of the fi eld, the Tritons scored 
four goals in the first half and 
three more in the econd, upping 
their season total to 34. Triton Head 
Coach Brian McManus' bunch 
outshot the Panthers 18-5 and took 
s ix more corner kicks than their 
cou nterparts. 

Ali son Hurley scored twice 
more to give UCSD a 4-0 lead 
go ing into halftime, heading one 
pas I the defenseless Chapman 
goali e in the 37th minute and 
notching the second on a one-
on-one breakaway in the 45th 
mi nute. AlTINT.ON All

Alomar spit in Hirshbeck's lace. 

That's right - Alomar 
hocked a big loogie right in an 
umpire's face. What was MLB 's 
response? To suspend him for 
five games, tarting NEXT 
SEASON. 

He hould have been 
suspended immediately, and his 
team should have heen without 
his services in the playoffs. 
Instead, he was allowed to play, 
and was a huge factor in the 
decidll1g game of the playoff 
series against the leveland 
Indians. He tied the game with a 
two-out, two-strike RBI single in 
the 9th inning, tying the contest 
at 3-3. Then, he hit a game-
winning home run in the 12th 
inning to send the Orioles to the 
American League Championship 
Series. 

Now he gets to be the hero, 
instead of sitting on the sidelines 
absorbing much-deserved blame 
for the Orioles being short-
Iwlded. His suspension will be
