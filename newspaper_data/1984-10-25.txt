UCSD prof. receives MacArthur Award 
By LORI MOORE 

PROFESSOR Michael H. Freedman has been awarded a $ I 76,000 MacArthur pnze for his work in 
the field of fou r-dimenSional space. 

According to the John D and 
Catherine 1. MacArthur Foundation , the 
tax-free prize IS awarded co "a small 
number 01 exceptionally talented 
individuals, who by their previous 
achievements have give n evidence o f 
Originality, dedIcation to creative . ., 
PUrsUitS , and capacity lor selr direCtion, 

The purpose of the award is to aU ow 
recipients the freedom to pursue the ir 
work, which could in turn lead to 
significant discoveries and contributions 
to society. 

Michael Freedman after rece iving S176.000. 

Freedman, who is only 33 years old , 
!>ald he wi ll definite ly use the money to 
further hiS reseJreh. 

"Exactly how is not so clear. I'm in no 
need of an experimental apparatus ," 
Freedman said . "One possibili ty is a 
supplemental salary if I go on le,IYe to 
stud y cenaln areas." 

Freedman's main Interest lies in 
gauge field theories , whi<.:h became 
popular In the 1950s, to understand 
particle phYSICS and cosmology. 

"1 took a direct route in math , not 
looking tOO closely at particle phYSICS," 
said Freedman. 'But the work I did had 
a connection with pan icle physics." 

Pamcle physiCS emerged earty thiS 
ce ntury when it became clear that 
minute speci mens are enigmatiC and 
have at least a dual f'eature . They do not 
reaUy behave in a mechanical sense. 

Among the several fields Freedman 
has researched is four-dime nsional 
space. Such researc h led to his winning 
the MacAnhur Award. 

"Dime nSions actuaUy aren't anyrhing 
in panicular, JUSt a tool for describing 
problems," Freedman said . "You 
understand little pieces of the universe 
when you do sc ience." 

Freedman's wife Leslie "Sam" 
Howland , a graduate student in 
pharmacology, is pleased with her 
husband's accomplishment. 

Howland, who is busy with her theSiS, 
says that she and her husband "talk 
about doing joint projects, but neve r get 
around to it." 

Freedman said Lhal he reads about 
lOO pages of his wife's selence

Regents OK budget 
The University of Californta Board of 

Regents has approved a $3.98 billion 
operaung budget for 1985·86 that is 
designed to "move us one step further 
along In the restordtion process," one 
Universiry official said. 

In accepting the proposal, whICh 
represents a 6.6% increase over this 
year's budget , the Regents requested 
from the state $97.5 million in new 
general funds, plus $ 148 million for 
capital needs. 

The budget was conSidered in detail 
by Regents' committees at a speCial 
meeting on September 28, and approved 
by the full board at its October meeting 
at UCLA on October 19. 

University Vice President for Budget 
and University Relations William B. 
Baker tOld the Regents that two-thirds of 
the budget request, covcnng fixed costS 
and workload , is "essentlal In order to 

maintain program funding at its present" 
level and keep us from slipping behind , 

The olher one- third, he nored , 
involves program improvements. -We 
havc known all along that one good 
budget, by itse lf. cannot repair the " 
damage of many years of budget cuts, 
Baker said . He pOinted to several 
initiatives "where the University can 
make important contributions toward 
solving some of society's urgent 
problems." 

Among the new proposals are a $2 
million program for research on ways to 
prevent damage to the envtronment 
from toxic wastes , $2 million for 
research in biotechnology, and S 1 
million for research on presef\'l ng 
genetic dlverslry for future plant and 
ammal breeding.

Acceptance goes both ways 
Editor: 

I am wrltl ng III response to "Accept 
~Ie For What I Am .. . Don't Reject Me 
For What I Am ;\Ot" (Perspectives. Ol:t. 
12) Although the account was highly 
fkllonahzed . It IS obVIOUS that the 
character "Meg" III the story, the lesbian, 
IS really me. My name IS not Meg, It IS 
haron Moxon , former LAGO co-chalr. 

"Stephanie" IS not the Author's real 
name. 

Naturally, I am upset. Anyone 
portrayed In such a man ner would be. It 
hurts to know that someone thlllks of 
me as a molester 01 non-gay wome n. 

I really did have a class wi th the 
author. and I really did give her an 
1I1vitatlon to a LAGO dance, but the rest 
of It IS simply not true. 

It takes a lOt of courage to "come out" 
to someone. The author of the art icle 
was an acquaintance in a III class 1 dtd 
have hopes for her ... ol'jricnds hlp. I 
thought it would be Illee to have some 
fr iends in the li t department. I knew she 
wasn't gay. So I gathered my strength 
and gavc her an Invita tion to a U\GO 
dance, only because I t.:ouldn·t put It

-You're my Inend and I want you to 
know that I'm gay, and that's okay." he

did n't think she'd give n me a second 
though t (I wasn't asking you, "Steph," 
for a date. Sorry to crush your 
fa ntasy. 

I acce pted thiS woman as she was. 
and wanted her as a frie nd . She didn't 
accept me-she jumped to stereotypical 
conclusIOns. 

When gay people first "come out 01 
the close t." we have a need to te ll 
people because It IS so tm portant to us . 
Findtng out I was gay changed ilround 
everythtng 111 my life . 

It was hard lor me to come out to 
"Stephanie." It hurts even now, two 
years lalcr, to fllld out [h,J[ she laughed 
about my U\GO dance Invltallon. (By

Small price for peace 
Editor: 

Soviet President Konstantlll U. 
Chernenko ret.:e ntly sa id 111 an Interview 
with the Washi ngton Post that relations 
between the US and the Soviet Union 
could be be[te r If the US moves e\'en an 
inch on anyone of lour arms cont rol 
Issues. The Reagan admministration 
"agrees Wi th President Chemenko that 
there [S no sound alternative to 
constructi ve development 111 relations 
be[Wee n our two countries:' a cord lllg 
to White House spokesman Larry 
Speakes. However. thi s Administration 
says that the US will not "pay a price" to 
achieve these ends. 

But IS thi s really such a great price to 
pay? All we need to do. fo r exam ple, is 
to rall fy the rhreshold Test Ban Treaty 
which limits underground testi ng to a 
maximum 01 150 kilotOns. But the 
ReJgiln adm 1l11strauon contends th .1I 
vC Tlfica tion 01 Soviet compliance with 
these measu res IS difficult. Howeve r, if 
our mtst rust prevents u from complying 
with this Issue then wh), not agree With 
another one. numely, a li mit on 
mlitu.ri zullon of space. The LIS IS far 
ahead of the Soviets In thiS ft eld and 
our co ntinu ing eflorts 111 the "Star Wars" 
progrdm can onl), prompt the Sov iets to 
be e"en more nervous and to want to 
I ncreasc their e1fon~ 111 t h l~ macahre 
competition . 

A third Issue with which the 
Adm llllstratllln has re lused [0 comply IS

It would "pre erve an unstable balan e 
and seriously handicap effolls to 
achieve real reductions of nuclear 
weapons." 0 lllstead of freezing, we 
contin ue to build up our nuclear arsenal 
which clearly handicaps efforts 111 
reduci ng nucleur weapons. 

The failure to achieve thIs mutual 
freeze is due to deception by the 
Reagan Administration, which has 
conVinced the American people that the 
Soviets are so powerful that we must 
keep building up our arsenals. An 
analys is of the unratified SALT II treaty 
of 1979 is instructive. 

The Adminsitration would cite as 
eVidence of our inferiority the 
requirements of SALT \I that we would 
be left with far fewer ICBM's and SLBM's 
(Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles) 
than th e Soviets. However, the fact is 
that our fewer strategiC missiles carry 
more warheads than those of the Soviets 
so that even assuming the ratification of 
SALT II we would outnumber them in 
tenns of warheads by 10,000 to 6.900. 
Moreove r, the index of lethahty, or 
effeCtIve ness, for our missiles is greater 
than th ose of the Soviets and with so 
many more efl ective warheads, one can 
only wonder wh y President Chernenko 
would suggest a freeze . ould It be that 
thiS IS really an ovenure lor peace 
whi ch we are rejecting' 

Fina lly, an Issue 10 which the Reagan

How indeed? 
Editor: 

What thi s "academ[cally onented and 
midtermed-out student" would like to 
know is how the hell Alicia Ago's trashy 
anicle wound up in last Thursday's 
edition of The Guardian. Her article 
"Dannevik's troops invade Sin City" 
doesn't belong in the spons section of 
UCSD's Guardian; if it deserves to be 
printed at all , The National Enquirer 
would be much more appropriate. 

Agos fills an entire page of our 
newspaper with garbage that suggestsd 
that the women's volleyball team wasted 
their time and our money on some wild 
excursion in !.as Vegas while the rest of 
-harrased people ... are slaving over 
those wicked physics tests ." Now I've 
heard it aU! 

Apparently, Ms Agos has never been 
involved with a team SpOrt - much less 
a competitive one that is played at the 
intercollegiate level. Sh~ diplays a IOtal 
lack of respect for the' tremendous 
dedication of these rrilOn women, and , 
evidently, she has absolutely no concept 
of an essential aspect of a successful 
team - namely, unity. 

The road-trip to !.as Vegas was more 
than an excellent opportunity lor the 
team to compete with a tough DiVISion 1 
school. it gave the athletes a chance 10 
interact with one another on a social 
level. For Ms. Agos to undermine the 
va lue of this experience only shows her 
ignorance, but for her to Imply that our 
volleyball team reeks of decadent 
Iloozies IS inexcusable. In case you 
missed the unplication and think that's 
tOo harsh an accusa[lon . you need only 
look at the debasing graphic that 
accompanies her article. John Ashlee

Mondale p~ovides the leadership we need 
By AMY BRESLA W 

"San Diego welcomes Ronald Reagan. 
Leadership that's working." These were 
the words that confronted me and some 
100 Democrats in the midst of some 
10,000 (of 20.000 expected) Republican 
supporters at the Republican rally 
downtown on Monday, October 22. 

Those words hung on the banner; 
they stared us in the face. We were 
Joncd 10 question the verity of that 
statement, and I, for one, as a 
concerned , aware Democrat at UCSD, 
have consequently joined (he increaSing 
number of mvolved students who 
fervently (at a "fever pitch," to quote 
Mark Hoffman) protest that no, Reagan 's 
leadership Iws nor been "working," and 
wi th four more years , not only would it 
not work any more ei'fieiently, but It 
would IIlcreasingly weaken US security , 
both from the inside , with regard 10 
domestic policy, and outside its borders, 
111 reference to Reagan 's attitude toward 
imperialism and the nuclear arms race. 
In this article, I will focus on domestlc 
questions, with foreign policy to be 
examined at a later date. 

A thought-provoking topic of 
domestic concern, the polluting of our 
environment , is an issue of which few 
people are aware. Quite simply, if we do 
not clean up our water and our air, we 
will not be able to continue existing as a 
truly health-conscious nation, nor 
maintain the-resources to build one for 
"our children." The reality is Reagan has 
never cared enough (0 devote the time 
or precious dollars to Ihe environmental 
problems this nation faces . The facts: 
First. in 1981, the Reagan 
administra tion proposed a two-thirds 
slash back in the Environmental 
Protection Agency's operating budget. A 
reduction?! JUSI when we needed 
desperately to learn more about toxic 
chemicals to protect pubUc health! And 
how many people knew that the budget 
for Clean Drinking Water was cut by 
30%, even when a government study 
found discharge measures of hazardous 
WaSil' , toxic substances and pesticides 
in our waters practically unenforced? 

Fun hermore , in 1980, the 
Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) issued 

comprehenSive health standards to 
protect workers against 18 knowll 
carcinogens. ince then, however, under 
Reagan, an alarming -+5% of those 
workers arc no longer covered by 
inspections, and Ill> final new health 
standard has been issued during 
Reagan's term. The result (along With the 
EPA's closing of JUSt six of the 546 toxic 
dumps in the US during the laSi four 
years): a "record that Idoesl speak for 
itself' ( to quote Lauri Shirck); a general 
disregard for public health in wake of 
escalating contamination of our natural 
and vital resources. Must Reagan 's 
dnnking water become aCcidentally 
contaminated and in tum threaten hiS 
life before he will walle up and start 
doing something about this urgent 
problem? 

Briefly , in contrast, Mondale co-
sponsored the Clean-Air Act of 1970, 
signed I nto law the Water Pol\unon 
Control Act of 1972 and supported 
federal funding for research and 
development of alternative energy 
sources, as well as energy conservation 
programs. Achieved during his years as 
a US Senator, these measures indicate 
Mondale's continuing commitment to 
the health and safety of our ci tizens. He 
even established the EPA Superfund to 
clean up hazardous waste sites, which 
Reagan has failed to use for its 
mandated purpose . 

To sta te that Reagan's leadership has 
failed solely in this area, however, would 
be an understatement of his lack of 
concern as regards domestic issues. 
Take a minute and question Reagan's 
attitude toward higher education. During 
his administration, dollars for student 
programs were cut by 21%, while those 
funds for over one miUion college 
students receiving Pell Grants (low and 
moderate-income students) threatened 
to be eliminated altogether. Guaranteed 
Student Loans (GSL) and funds for 
international education programs were 
slashed , as well . 

It seems that Reagan JUSt doesn 't 
regard our education as crucial enough 
to the buildup of "intellectual" arms in 
this country to give it a share in his 
budget aUocation, even though it has

been claimed that he IS "the clear 
cho ice for students." Which students? 
Think twice , you guys. Those increases 
in the defense budget were extracted 
from somewhere .... 

Instead , it is Mondale who has fought 
for and with Title I , to supply aid for 
disadvantaged students, handicapped 
education and bilingual education. I ask 
you: Must you be financially or otherwise 
di sadvantaged , handicapped or foreign 
in order to appreciate the contmued 
dedication of a man who perseveres III 
the struggle toward I'd ucatlonal parity 
for all citizens? No! 

Another issue that does not affect us 
yet, directly, is Medicare , whose 
expenses will rise to $112 billion by 
1988 unless we cut health care costs 
llOW. Onl y Mondale has ininated a plan 
to do so, in which all states would be 
free to adopt their own strategies withtn 
an overall spending limit. We simply 
cannot leave the burden of mounting 
health care costs to the next genemuon. 
Yes, taxes have been cut by $750 bill ion 
th roughout, but who is profiting from 
thiS reduCtion , and who is suffering? As

Reagan admini tration has prop ed a 
further 40')0 slash back in funding to 
voc.llional education, somethi ng which 
is so essential to the growth of career 
advancemem in our country. 

In fact, many events have occurred , 
under the Reagan admin istration that 
cause us to seriously question the terms 
"fiscal stabtlrty" and "economic 
prosperity" t:Urrently being applied to 
the facade of securiry tor all. ThiS just 
Isn't true , and a prime example is 
eVidenced b)' the fact that during this 
presidenc)I, 521 bi llion for agricultural 
programs was mismanaged so that fann

Paralleled b), hiS foreSight In other

propose a full program of recovery, 
amounting to an estimated savings of 
nearly 510 billion by the fiscal yea r 
1989. 

There seems to be some discrepany, 
as well, about just how many "new Jobs" 
Reagan "created" during his 
adminsitration, Let's not exaggerate, 
guys: -In Defense of Presidem Reagan," 
(October 22) states, "The coumry is well 
on its \Va)' to the President's goal of six 
million Jobs by the end of 1984." 
However, "Reagan is the Clear Choice 
for Students" (in the same issue) claims 
thar "SIX million ncw jobs have been 
created in the last year lalonel ." Get the 
f.lets straight. cw Jobs havc been 
created , but eight percent 01 the work 
force I~ ,tdl unemplo)'ed, and the 
current admll1lstrJtion has without

Cover story 

The new neon sculpture: sin or virtue? 
By EDWARD ISRAEL 

U CSD HAS UNEXPECTEDLY BECOME the ce nter of a neon art controversy in which the 
reaction of the La Jolla comillunity is 
bei ng descnbed as "hystencal" by UCSD 
art curator Maty Beebe, 

"For some reason, people tend to get 
hystencal over contemporary art:' said 
Beebe, The), thll1k 1[', a I1Ightclub or a 
bar." 

The sculpture, proposed by artlst 
Bruce Nauman, would conSist of a nng 
of five foot high leiters encircling the 
roof of the Mandell-Weiss Center for the 
Performing Arts, The sculpture would 
Bash into the La Jolla sky a list of the 
seven vices and a seven virtues. 

The neon would become lhe late t 
addition to the lUart Colle~tion which 
Includes the purple fence, the Sun God 
and the granite sculpture on Rcvelle 
Lawn . 

At the same rime, rhc ~culpture Illight 
display the word ANGER on one side of 
the Weiss building and the word 
TEMPERANCE on lhe other Side, The 
ItSt o[ vices and vtrlue, would nash 
around the bUlldll1g III oppOSite 
citrectlons, said Beebe, who directs the 
·wan Collection at UCSD. 

The seven vlrlUes from Ihe middle 
ageS-PRUDENCE, TEMPERANCE, 
FORTITUDE, FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY 
and J USTIC E, would go clockwise. The 
seven vices- PRIDE, AVARICE , 
GLUTIONY, ENVY, SLOTH, ANGER 
and LUST, would circulate In the 
opposi te direction , 

Beebe, in a letter to Mandell Weiss, 
said, "It 's neve r a good time for these 
projects: they are always subJe t 10 
reactionary h)lsteria .. .. The bUllding(the 
Mandell Weiss Center) is calling out for 
something on it. It's Just a plain , pretty 
ugly, big block out there ," said Beebe. 

La Jollans, already angered at UC D 
for sponsoring Blackhorse Farms, a large 
residential , commerCial, research and 
conference complex proposed for the 
land leased from UCSD, are not reacting 
favorably to the neon art. 

"It's 100 amllt gardr i'or the qUiet La 
Jolla reSidential community," said La 
Jolla resident Nanc)1 Ward . "I don't 
mind if it's further inside the campus, I 
would hope that it's more for the 
UniverSity." 

Mandell Weiss, 93, sa id he "IS 100% 
for it I thll1k it's Just nght but people 
are treating It as if it were a road stgn ," 
said Weiss who donated 1.2 million 
lllwards the Performing An~ Center. 

'I hose who oppose the sculpture are 
dJlmll1g II IS a sign, clllng a zoning 
code. A highly restrictive code for the La 
Jolla 'hores Planned District prohibits 

Bruce Nauman's neon sculpture may become the 
newest addition to the Stuart Collection, but the work 
has been labeled an eyesore by La Jollans. 

(Pictured are five examples of Nauman's previous neon artwork.) 

the use of all signs that "rotate, move , 
nash, renect, blink or effect changes in 
hue or intensity . . , . Neon signs are 
prohibited ," states the 1974 ordinance. 

Nevertheless, UCSD does not have to 
adhere to ZOI1l ng rules, because it is a 
state institution and tS exempt from 
local prohibirions. Moreover, zoning 
laws penatn to signs, not an. 

"It 's nOl a sign, It'S art. A sign IS to sell 
.I produCl, it's a commercial thing. We're 
not advertlstng all),thing," said Beebe, 

"It looks like a sign so there IS that 
type of Interpretation , but liS function IS 
dd{erent from a sign:' said Bruce 
Nauman, who hds been working In 
neon lor 18 years, 

Beebe does nor know exactly why 
there IS such opposition to the 
proposed an sll1ce "this is not some 
sign maker In Tijuana , Thls IS one of the 
foremost antstlc sensibilities of ou r 
time . .. . They're putting up atrOCities all 
over the place. Jack :-,Jayman put up that 
great big phallus; you can see It from 
the freeway," said Beebe , 

In Europe people have been delighted 
by neon for decades, where II I> a 
tremendous an entity. I'\auman feels that 

orth Amencans are "ready for It as 
much a' they're read)' for any art." 

con IS alive and well III other parts 
01 -,1I1 Diego, most notably 111 Hill rest, 
whIch recently relighted ItS bright ptnk 
neon stgn over Universtty and Fifth 
Avenue. Hillcrest's shops and restaurants 
also have recently started to glow II1slde 
111 solt greens, blues and pinks. 

eon also adorns the Mission Valley 
tower clock. which, like the Mandell 
Weiss Center, is another highly visible 
landmark. 

"One thtng the community forge ts in 
their pani ilnd h),stena is that It 
doesn't have to be on all of the lime ," 
said Beebe. The sculpture could be 
displayed on weekdays or holidays, or 
since there are only )0 student 
productions, on these ntghts, noted 
Beebe. 

Beebe expects frnal .Ipproval by 
UCSD Ch.1I1ce\lor Richard Atkl'1son 
some ume after February of 1935 , after 
thJt lime, it could take up to SIX months 
to COnStuCl, because some 01 the glass 
has to be Imported from Europe, That 
allows the urroundtng communllY to 
become more acquatnted with and 
accustomed to the sculpture, said a 
hopeful Mary Beebe. 

"Like the un God , you give it to 
them and let them lil'e Wi th II lor a

FOR THE 
Finding a good place [Q eat 

between classes can bc difficult, 
especiaUy if you're not familiar wilh 
the various eateries on campus. 
Each coUege, except for Warren. has 
a place to eat and socialize. The 
Munch Box at Third's dining 
commons is small, but has a good 
selection of food . At Muir, there is 
the RathskeUar which is a cafe(eriJ-
style restauram. The atmosphere is 
quite relaxing and there's even a 
piano in the dining area which 
occasionally gets played by the more 
courageous students. Located in the 
Student Center. across from the 
Main Gym , is the Triton Pub , If 
you're under 21 years of age you 
can't order drinks , but they do have 
a grill and make delicious 
hamburgers. Perhaps the best place 
[Q eat is at the Revelle Deli . The Deli, 
which is temporarily located al Why 
Not Here? next [Q the cafe teria, does 
nO! accept meal cards; so many 
commuters go there to avoid the 
lines. It has a variety of sandwiches 
on all rypes of bread, soups and 
sa lads. All the rood is very 
nutri(ional. Of course , if you're in a 
hurry you can always grab a snack at 
(he Revelle Sundry store. The candy 
worms are very tasty and great for 
pranical jokes!

Budget 
< CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3 J: 

The budget also requests $5 ,6 million 
for programs to help improve the 
preparation of students for University-
level work and to increase the number 
of students transferring from the 
community colleges to the University, 

"While these effons are intended to 
benefit all studt'nts, our expectation is 
that they will be especially helpful to 
slUdents from underrepresented 
minority groups," Baker said , 

A one-time $15 million allocation is 
requested to help reduce lhe 
University's backlog of obsolete 
instructional equipment and to begin 
purchaSing new computer equipment for 
faculty and staff. 

The capital budget includes proposals 
for new construction , for rehabihtiltion 
and conversion of eXisting faCilities to 
new uses, for health and safety 
corrections, for renewal of utility and 
building systems , and to provide access 
for th e handicapped . 

Baker noted that the highest-priority 
facilities requirements have been 
identified to accommodate continued 
enrollment growth-at least 2,000 more 
undergraduates and 243 graduate 
students are expected for the 1985-86 
school year-and to preserve the quality 
of existing instmction and research 
programs. 

Two specihc areas-salaries and 
student fees-are not included in the 
approved budget. 

The University Will forward to the 
Regents its recommendation for salary 
Increases at a later meeting, although 
Baker noted, "The University'S object ive 
is to maintain laculty and staff salaries 
at their present relative competitive 
levels ." 

Any recommendation on student fees 
will be deferred until a long-term fee 
policy, requesled last year by the 
legislature , IS developed , Discussions 
between UC and Cali fornia State 
Univesrity officials, Icglslative and 
Depallment of Ftnance staff, and 
slUdent representatives will culminate in 
a fee policy and calculation standard by 
January I, I Y85, 

When the 1985-86 budget was 
presented to Regents' committees on

Students react to presidential debate 
By JULIE PRESS 

Historian Rus el Hvolbck said that 
Dcmocratic candldatc Walter Mondale 
won the Presidential dehatc on fureign 
p licy issues, 

"I think Mr. Mondale won, He did 
what he set out to do ... , He gunned up 
diplomacy." 

Amid thc clatter 01 clanking dishes 
and silverware , and the dill of 
conversation, students at the Muir 
College cafetena Sunday night had 
"Dmncr with Fmz and Ron ," The 
spe ial Wide-sc reen showing of the 
second Presidential debate was 
co-sponsored by UCSD's chapter 01 
CaIPI RG (California Public Interest 
Research Group), the AsSOCiated 
Students and the Muir College Council 
as pall of a nationwide voter education 
program. 

Following the de~ate, students were 
encouraged to stay for a discussion 
session mediated by Dr, Hvolbek. 

"We didn't want faculty talking at 
students," said Karen Weinstein , 
Campus Organtzer for CaIPIRG, "we 
wanted an open fomm where students 
could express their views and clarify 

their questions." 
Intcnt faces watched the enure twO-

1984, Said Weinstein , ·Sixteen hundred 
student leaders got together m February 
and se t the goal at one million new 
rcglstercd voters, I thmk we've come 
pretty close to our goal." 

Phase one of the SCVR mvolved 
J.lUally registcnng students to vote, and 
phase twO Involves helping them lea m 
ahout the Issues, so they can make an 
educated chOice for either party o n 
November 6, 

As the dmner hour drew to a close 
and the giant 1\' was Ilenced , only a 
handful of Interested students remamed 
out of thc hundreds who watched the 
debate . IntroducecN,y Kim Paulus, 
CalPIRG's state chalT\vomJ,n, Dr. 
Hvolbck began listing what he called 
"ke y issues" of the election and opened 
the floor for opinions or questlons. "I 
don 't want this to be a political 
argument," he announced and 
proceeded to raise key issue number 
one: Which is better, militilry strenglh 
first , then diplomacy, or vice ve rsa? 

Student George Gerace said , "Reagan 
has shown us through media slips that 
he wants to blow up Russia "" We need 
better dtplomacy than that." 

US involvement in foreign affims, 
however, aroused heated discussion , 
with all but one student on the side of 
the Democrats (an unexpected turnout 
considering the appearance of a highly 
pro-Reagan audience during the actual 
debate), 

On our involvement In Central 
America, another member of CalP1RG 
declared , "I feel that I'm not being 
presented with the truth at all by thiS 
Administration." AddesJ Catherine 
Mathews, "We're playing bully , '" We 
don't have a right to support people 
who would destroy our nation." 

The criticisms began to deViate from 
the issue at hand as students exclaimed 
with displeasure about a wide range of 
Reagan's policies and then focused on 
his leadership abilities. CalPIRG member 
Gregory WiJpen said , "The importilnt 
part of leadership is being able to make 
split second decisions .. .. You don't 
have time to meet with committees," IiJ 

MacArthur 
Award 

UC D Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
called the award "a high honor for one 
of our outstandtng young fawlty 
members." 

"I am dehghted for him and lor the 
Depallment 01 Mathematics ," Atkmson 
said . "UCSD is very fortunate to h,IVe a 
scholar of the caliber of Dr. Freedman 
on its faculty," 

The award was the latest In a string 
of honors which Freedman has accrued 
during the past few months. 

LaSt Apnl Freedman was named 
"Cahfornia S(:lentist of the Year" by the 
Californta Museum 01 Science and 
Industry, and the following month was 
selened lor membership in the National 
Academy of SCiences, one of the highest 
honors lor any American scientist. 

In 1982 he achteved International 
notoriety by solving the POincare 
Conjecture , a mathematical puzzle 
which had stumped mathematicians for 
82 years , 

Freedman becomes the third member 
of the UC D faculty to win a MacArthur 
Award . Ramon Guuerrcz, an assistant

first such a\\"Jrd in 1983, and Arnold

By SHELLEY AANERUD 

LIGHT REPRE E TS THE illununanon that comes from insight. Frequently, comiC strips 
display a light bulb above a character's 
head when an Idea "nashes" in his 
mind. The hght bulb represents an idea 
that appears from nowhere, and 
presumably offers the thinker a choice. 
Choice can ultimately lead to greater 
freedom to c hoose what we reaDy want 
for ourselves. And this is what I like best 
about the light bulb-next to extending 
my evenings-the light bulb gave me 
greater insight into my own dependent, 
helpless nature. I could then choose to 
be otherwise . Let me explain. 

I married at 20. It was a ' sweep-me-
off-my-feet" romance. He was a dashing 
dentist and I was a medical receptionist. 
What could be more ideal? I could work 
for him and make his practice grow. He 
would be proud to have me work in his 
office. In all the sweeping, the dust 
clouded my mind and I completely 
forgot that I had taken this job as a 
temporary measure until I knew what 
career I wanted to pursue In college. (A 
wise 85 year old woman recently said to 
me, "Women do weD until they fall in 
love . Then they forget everything.") I 
forgot everything: aD my plans for a 
career and especially my promise to 
myself that I would not marry until I was 
at least 25 . Two months after meeting 
the dentist, we married . 

When I was a child , my mom used to 
tell me that God watched over me while 
I slept. DUring the long summer days 
she lUcked me In bed before sundown 
In fresh sheets. in a room painted light 
blue . She said. ·Saint Anthony si ts at the 
foot of your bed with his flaming sword 
to protect you. and God , too, watches 
over you all night." With her hands, she 
made gestures of God 's greatness-His 
enormous size-and pointed out the 
window, as if He were somewhere 
outside , too large for my bedroom. She'd 
lean down and kiss me goodnight. I 
gave her a bear hug. I slept secure. I 
believed God was some kind of light 
and sometimes after sunset I would 
wake up and see a comforting light filter 
through t.he green cunalns into my 
room. The porch light next to my 
bedroom window became God to me , 
until of course, it dawned on me that it 
was only a porch light and nothing 
more. 

Then at SIX years old , after school 
each day, I would lean against the 
house, standing on the front porch, 
clutching my Casper the Ghost lunch 
pail and finger paintings against my 
chest, watching the ground, waiting for 
my father to leave for the night shift. I 
always arrived home toO early. Dad was 
still yelling at Mom. His terrible four 
leller words shot OUt through the walls 
and filled the neighborhood. I never 
understood what he was yelling about. I 
could only hear those foul words and so 
could the neighbors. rhey told me so in 
voices blending complaint and pity . I 
hated it. His yelltng frazzeled my nerves 
to frizzy Wires, so much so, that every 
mo rning before school after pulling on 
my white lace nylon socks and tieing 
the laces of my black and white saddle 
shoes, I threw up. Looking up at the 
porch light that wasn't on , I guessed 

Installing a new light 

God took days off so He could work the 
night shift, too. 

My home became man less when I was 
eleven. My parents divorced and my 
brother ran away. My dad came to my 
sixth grade promotion. After the 
ceremony was finished , he hugged me, 
squeezing me hard , and said , "I won't 
see you much any more , but you can 
write ." I saw his eyes redden and his 
lower lids pool. I had , at age II , a 
cenain understanding of m)' father, 
though. I never blamed him for 
throwing things through the living room 
window, yelling at all of us, occaslonaDy 
hitting my mother. Somehow I separated 
those acts from the man. It was hiS 
alcoholic disease that made him act that 
way So, when he left , I felt relieved that 
m)' mom would not have to put up With 

~im anymore and I would not lear or 
hear his relling. But I would miss hiS 
hugs. He rarely yelled at me and he 
never hit mc. I wa!> a good girl , daddy's 
Imle girl , Suzy-Q 

After my rather left, the porch light 
became a welcome home beacon at the 
end of long trips , or cold rainy nights. 
But in high school, I wished the porch 
light would bum out, or that my mother 
would (orget to tum it on. That light 
became a glaring nuisance. After all, I 
wanted my goodnight kisses hidden in 
the dark. Those years, my mom and I 
did JUSt fine without men. I weeded , 
mowed, trimmed hedges, tightened 
loose screws, painted , and also mopped 
the floors and washed the clothes aD 
through my junior high and high school 
years. And my mother and I never let 
light bulbs remain unchanged once the), 
burned out. But something happened 
when I marned . 

Over m)' acqUired Independence, cob 
webs grew and dust settled . I could no 
longer do for myself. This helpless 
behavior wa5 encoumged by my 
husband. He would do the gardening, 
fix leak)' laucct!>. lighten lonse sc rews, 
and e h'lIlgt: lighl bulb!> It was ~b II lOy 

long, white , lacy wedding gown stuck to 
my skin permanently, never allowing 
independence to soil it or growth to 
bust its seams. To the relationship, I 
could contribute only smiles, clean 
sheets, and fresh toilets. 

One and a half years after I married , 
a light went out in the entty of our new 
home. I stared up at the blackness, but I 
could not bring myself to change the 
bulb . I did not know why. The starch 
from the wedding gown was too much; I 
was paralyzed. I sat down on the sofa 
and looked up at the black space. It 
seemed to glare back at me. It was like a 
bat hanging upside down from the 
ceiling. What was happening to me? I 
told my husband about it when he came 
home. But he had other things to do 
and did not feel that was a top priority 
item. 

Weeks passed. The bulb haunted me . 
It loomed overhead and there was no 
way I could avoid its ugly blackness. It 
seemed to laugh at me every time I 
passed under it. That was impossible. 
But I thought I could hear it chanting, 
repeating as "The Raven": "Helpless 
imbecile, helpless imbecile, notions of 
wifery will keep )'ou stined evermore." 
That was it. I had to do something. I 
could feel myself becoming benign 
protoplasm, clear gelatin, melting into 
the orange Mediterranean sofa. Soon I 
knew I was doomed to complete 
absorption into the threads. The 
cushions would swaDow me up and the 
bat would swoop, laughing hideously at 
my remains. 

I slipped off the sofa and searched 
for the ladder. I dragged the six-foot 
wooden ladder into the entry. I found a 
replacement bulb, the screw driver, and 
then set up the ladder. I was ready. My 
stomach tightened . My knees shook. 
What if I broke the bulb or dropped it 
while climbing the ladder? What if the 
light wouldn't work after all this? Up the 
ladder I finally went, dropping the screw 
driver as I climbed . I could almost feel 
that damn bat laughing at me . Now 
powered by determination I climbed 
down qUickly , grabbed the screw driver, 
and ascended the ladder once again. I 
would not be humiliated by a dead bulb 
and I wanted to stop these crazy 
images. 

Without thinking, I tackled the 
screws, dropping twO on the floor. But I 
did not Stop to see where they landed. I 
did not dare disturb my concentration . I 
kept going. Finally the light cover was 
ofr. There hung the blackened bulb 
looking as if its neck had been choked 
by the socket, almost embarrassed by its 
earlier teaSing and tauntmg of me. I 
gmbbed its neck and twisted it out. It 
would not haunt me any mor~. 

I picked up the clean, fresh , white 
bulb and gently turned ItS shiney metal 
neck into its new home. I felt relieved. I 
knew this was going to work. I knew I 
had used the proper amount of pressure 
while tighlcmng the bulb in place. Then 
I replaced the cover With two screws. It 
hung securel),. I didn't care about the 
other twO scrcws I dtmbed down the 
ladder, reached for the light switch and 
llIrncd the new Itght on. Voila! Sucee s! 
"Lct there be light. And thcre wa

Remodeling 
By CHRISTO PER CANOLE. Pmp.:Cl I\'~' Ldllm 

I N HER 0 CE-A-MONTH LETTER, Elizabeth casually asked if I would be interested in 
motorcycling from San Diego to 
Columbus, Ohio, to remadel her back 
porch. During the SIX ),ears since we 
separated we had not been together 
more than one da)' a year. Was her 
request and my response intended as 
just a remodeling of a porch? 

My preliminaty anxiety about living 
ten days with someone who had been 
my life and love for four years was 
replaced with 2,400 "under new 
construction" miles of 100- to 130-
degree August asphault; flashing red 
lights whenever m)' speed exceeded 55 
mph; treacherous crosswinds that also 
paid little heed to posted speed limits; 
and thunderstorms that turned my 
motorcycle adventure into a sea saga. 
The four days of constant physical stress 
balanced by unending hours of wind 
whistling through my emptying mind 
erased many frustrations and fears about 
being with Elizabeth again. 

I pulled up in front of her house at 
midday, but before I dismounted , 
Elizabeth motioned me to corral my 
steel steed around back in the dirt alley. 
After I removed my face armor, 
Elizabeth catiously hugged me and 
quickly escorted me through the garage 
into the back ),ard . Once my eyes 
adjusted to vibrationless fOCUSSing, I saw 
the porch. 

Through our letters, I had developed an 
older and more distressed image of what 
needed remodeling. Though there were a 
few wrinkles, fading of the porcelain white 
outer skin, and pane damage, I sensed the 
original foundation was stiU strong enough 
to handle the strains of remodeling. 

After unloading my personal items in 
the gueSt room, Elizabeth and I sat on 
the porch to survey what was needed 
and what was possible. She explained 
that each wall had different patterns of 

panes, because the people who had 
lived there previously had not 
established a workable la),out or 
relationship. The band-aid repair over 
the years made the condition look 
worse than it was. There were too many 
panes covered with dust and raindrop 
streaks to see clearly the garden beyond. 

We decided that if the remodeling 
was going to be successful this time we 
needed to tear down past conceptions 
of what the porch had been while 
leaving intact the foundation, which we 
both recognized was unique. We 
designed a flexible plan that would fulfill 
her needs and retain a stable shelter in 
which she could sit and dream, while 
also giving me a chance to demonstrate 
that my abilities in building things that 
could last had matured over the past six 
years. 

At breakfast, we both talked about our 
restless sleep that had resulted from the 
previous night's thunderstorm. We both 
expected more during my-vislt. Titus, 
the roof needed to be retarred 
immediately; otherwise the entire 
remodeling might be washed out by a 
sudden storm. We could see the effects 
of previous stonns. The protective 
shingles were cracked and worn, unable 
to hold back even heavy mist or warm 
summer droplets running down in 
streaks. 

The roofing was a sticky situation. If I 
handled the patching glue poorly there 
would be stains on my hands even after 
I returned to San Diego, and everyone 
would know I had botched the 
remodeling. I tacked the roofing fabric 
down with more nails than usual, trying 
to ensure a strong bond that would not 
quickly loosen after I left. Unfonunately, 
my exuberance emptied the box of new 
roofing nails, leaving me one foot shon 
of what was needed. Not wanting to 
waste what ~ had budgeted for 
materials, I scrounged around the 
basement and found what must have 

."cod-.trio 
IICOf ino 

.1 - '0 6- ... 
conCh' · ' 1-:::1 

bcen Idt over from the origlllal 
construction . This was not the first time 
in the remodeling that I had understood 
the value of mixing a little of the old 
and new materials available. 

Feeling a little mischievious and 
proud of the potential of the 
remodeling, I climbed up and washed 
down the roof to test what we had 
accomplished so far. Evetything held 
tight and we rested that night not 
fearing occasional storms. 

Before the construction could 
continue, the old panes and corroded 
framework needed to be removed, and 
the foundation required minor 
adjustments to handle the added load of 
the new arrangement. Unsure of how 
strong or brittle her walls had become 
over the ),ears of weathering, I 
approached the dismantling phase with 
delicacy and determination. The walls 
resisted my effons at first , but came 
down easily as I discovered where to 
apply gentle pressure. As I was finishing. 
one panel of pane stubbornly refused to 
let go. I failed to notice it was firmly 
nailed into the base foundation . My 
frustration turned to anger, and as the 
pane broke free it cut my finger. 
Elizabeth came running to my angry 
scream and kissed the tiny wound as if 
I were a child. 

That night I lay alone in my bed 
worrying about how the soft inside of 
the porch, now without protection of 
the walls, might suffer from sudden 
exposure to the constantly changing 
weather. I rose and ~nt for a walk in 
the rain. Throughout the new family 
neighborhood I saw many slick, 
polished-aluminum porches awkwardly 
hanging OntO the side of old brick and 
wood houses. A few owners had taken 
care to maintain both parts of their 
homes as a strong visual and structural 
relationship. This is what I wanted to 
recreate at Elizabeth's. 

The next day I scraped away the 
main layers of paint from the 
foundation, exposing the original wood 
and finding it strong yet supple. We 
chose to match this mature wood with 
more costly weathered stock, which was 
already set in its ways. 

Our plans called for a Simpler and 
more open layout than what we had 
attempted before. The fragile panes of 
the past would be replaced by more

flexible screening so the people inSide 
could see, smell, hear and absorb more 
of the world around them . 

As the remodeling continued , thc 
mghtly storms ceased. Even my 
poundmg of nails no longer splintered 
the wood . Or was I payi ng more 
attention thiS time to the mlllor detaIls) 
The work was taking more time than I 
had expected as I lost myself III hours 
of sanding and stroking the older rough 
wood to its younger, smoother luster. My 
hands' memory sought out forgotten , 
familiar, deep-grain characteristics. 

After supper Elizabeth and I dCClded 
it was about time to consider a lude 
remodeling of the bed. We staned 
slowly, but soon our enthusiasm drove 
us into a frenzy of roughing off 
splintered and scarred surfaces that had 
lain open to easy damage over the years. 
Since Elizabeth 's sister would be 
returning home from ~ork soon , we 
were concerned that the sounds of our 
intense labors might disturb her sleep. 
So we lalded all evidence of our 
constructive improvements into the 
drop cloth and agreed to return to the 
bed later. 

Before the final screenlllg, the 
molding had to be CUt, prefitted and 
painted to avoid rips or splattered paint 
that would mar the view. CUlling the 
screen reminded me of the times I 
watched Liz cut fabnc for the clothes we 
wore. The screen blocked out biting 
mosquitos , but did not block out the 
romantic charm of watching fireflies at 
night. 

Everything fit well together during the 
final days. The gaps and nail holes that 
showed were caulked. With an anist' 
brush I carefully touched up the few 
remaining blemishes. 

Liz and I cuddled together in Ihe new 
setting, watching the white paint dry. 
She turned to me and said ,"The 
bedroom reaDy needs more extensive 
remodeling. Do you have any plans for 
your winter vacation?" ~

Volleyball, water polo and soccer make 

The Final]ump toward the playoffs 
By JEFF SAVAGE, pOth blum 

FOR 54 UC D STUDEi'\T , Ilnal exams have arrived hvc weeks early. 
Women's volleyball, men's socce r and 

men's water polo Will all lace Judgment 
Day thIS weekend when each battle a 
foe seemingly larger than life . And for 
these 54 players. a passmg grade will be 
rewarded with graduation IntO the 
playo ffs, A loss, and the diploma Just 
rnlght get lost III the mall. 

The soccer team welcomes Colorado' 
College to Warren Field tomorrow at 3 
pm. The visitors Will arrive on the scene 
undefeated m 1984, and if, some three 
hours later, they exit unscathed , UCSD's 
only mvolvement In the NCAA DIVision 
III Championships may be entail 
reading about it in Ihe newspaper. A 
Triton victory, on the other hand , will 
most cenainly result in a Triton berth in 
these championships. It's that Simple . 

Right about the lime the Hnal whistle 
blows at Warren. the volleyball team Will 
be stepping onto the coun for a typical 
pre-game warm-up. The game, however, 
won't be so typical. The Tritons will be 
dOing digs and dives and serves and 
spikes about 200 miles to the north. In 
Leopard Country. Across the net from 
UCSO will be the nation's second-
ranked Division III team-the La Verne 
Leopards. La Verne has beaten UCSO 
once already this year, and a second La 
Verne win assures the club of a playoff 
spot. But even with a win, UCSD can't 

be so sure ahout thlllgs. Howevcr, If the 
Truons can de-cia\\' th ese Leopard~ thiS 
time , and then periorm <1 spaymg on 
Nov. 9 when the teams meet III Triton 
Pt1Vlhon. UC '0 Will not ani}' make the 
playo lIs , bUI will probably host the West 
Reglonals as well . 

The water polo team caps this 
frenzied weekend of UCSD uthletic 
activity unday morning with u nice , 
friendly game of polo with UC Santa 
Barbara at the Canyonvlew pool. About 
the only thing UC D has ever been able 
to do as well as Santa Barbara is jump 
into the pool before the game, The 
Tritons are 0-) against these guys since 
1981 , when the twO teams started 
playing each other. Worse yet, the 
Gauchos packed with them a ton of 
dynamite in all three aflairs, blowing 
UCSO out of the water by at least eight 
goals each time. But if the Tritons can 
upset the COUntry's seventh-ranked 
squad-as they very much feel they 
can- then say hello to the NCAA 
Division 1 Championships for the fi rst 
time ever. UtheLWise, forget it. 

A big UCSD span s weekend? Yes, 
rather oversized indeed . 

oW, UC D has enjoyed a reasonable 
amount of athletic success in the past. A 
national championship here, a 
sprinkling of playoff berths there. No, 
success hasn 't come in heaping 
mounds. but we've had our fi ll. This 
year, however, things are getting a bit 

out of hand , Three teJms, each Just onc 
Will from the playoffs. What is Ihe 
Athletic Department trying to dn? Get 
UCSD <I reputation) 

UCSD may be no U C football or 
UCLA basketball , but as Division III 
athlellcs go, Ihis is big IIIne, baby. 
Athletic Director Judy weet knows 
where the credit should go. "Our 
coaches are doing whal needs to be 
done to Held competitive teams. Derek 
(Armstrong) has been instrumental in 
instilling a winning attitude on the 
soccer team. Denny (Harper) has built a 
very competitive water polo program." 

And with a national championship 
and two second-place finishes in the 
last three seasons, Doug Dannevik has 
done a pretty good job with his 
volleybaU teams. 
- Sweet recognizes the progress made 
in UCSD athletics in less than one 
quartcr, but isn't about to pat herself on 
the back. "The success will enhance 
UCSD's reputation, but I don't think 
anyone involved with spons can ever be 
sa tisfied with progress already made." 

Cmon judy, there might be just a bit 
of sallsfaction creeping in, huh? 

Back to the weekend at hand .... 
While the rest of us are busy 

celebrating this Saturday night lor being 
a Saturday night, we can be sure that 
one group is tucking itself in a bit early. 
Allowing lor eight hours sleep doesn't 
necessarily mean a good night'S rest for 

the waler polo team, though , and, In 
bet, a IlIghtlnare or t\\'O might be m 
store lor these gentlemen. Memones, 
pal. Bad memories. 

In 1981 , Harper's firsl year at tim 
school , the 'I ritons warn agaillst Santa 
Barbara in the UC Irvine Tournament. 
UCSD swam the wrong way a lew times 
and was drubbed 14-5 . The following 
year, the Gauchos came to Tmonland 
and splashed around at Miramar, 
UCSD's pre -Canyonview water polo 
home. The Triton offense improved by a 
goal but the delense was just as 
generous as the year before. 14-6, UCSB. 
Last year, UCSO opened its season in 
Santa Barbara, and it was more of the 
same. The Tritons lost 13-4. 

So why should things be any different 
in 1984? "Because Santa Barbara has a 
tendency to play down at times," says 
Harper. "They don't always get fired up, 
and I hope they just take this game for 
granted." Harper is going to have to 
hope long and hard for that one. After 
lOSing to sixth-ranked USC by a 
dangerously slim 11-8 margin last 
Sunday, lne Tritons have shown that 
they can swim with the nation's top 
teams. UCSO's # 14 rating in the 
Division I polls helps to confirm this . 
And being at home doesn't hurt, either, 

UCSD's goal, of course , is to qualify

- Margaret Andrew, fOLWard-injured 
knee, missed several games; 
-Adricne Clark, halfback-bruised toe. 

That's the lis!. And you thought NFL 
teams suffered a lot of injuries. Women's 
soccer is a tOugh sport. 

Only three of the 17 active players on 
the team - Aafedt, Clark and fullback 
Marcy Stolarow-have made it through 
every game this season. Aafedt has done 
so with an on-again , off-agam thigh 
strain , and Clark has played With a 
bruised toe (remember, the sport is 
soccer, so a bruised toe is not akin to a 
hangnail). This leaves Stoia row as the 
one and only Triton women's soccer 
player to make it through the modest 
total of 17 games unscathed . This leaves 
the team with a poor record ()- 11 -) . 
And this leaves the coach With a 
perplexed and lrustrated expression. 

"I JUSt can't understand it," said 
Leaney qUietly in his British accent after 
reviewing the list, -It's JUSt a shame that 
we've had so many injuries thiS year." 

Marred by yet another injury, 
Tuesday's match was nevertheless a 
reprieve of sorts lor a patchwork group 
starved for W s. 

Against Chapman, a team UCSD had 
tied in one previous meettng thi s 
season, the home club lound itse lf 
undcr constantJ'ressure early. However, 
the delense he! ttght through the lir t 
hOllf, denying several scoring 
opportulllties off corner kicks, At the 
mhcr end, Clark was also denied the 
g.lIne's hr t go~1 as the hOlpman 
go.llkceper came up With a fl ne save 
CI.lrk agJII1 c<lIne c1o~e hut not close 
l' nough Oil J free kick whICh ",\lIed JUSt 
ovcr the b,lr, and the hall ended a 

scoreless tie . 
II wasn't scoreless for much longer. 

Chapman caught the UCSO defense 
napping in the first minute 01 the 
second half to break the stalemate. 

However, the goal only seemed to 
awaken the hosts, as the Triton olTense 
finally showed real signs of life. UCSD 
began to pressure the visitors with 
attack after atrack. Chapman's good 
defense sttOed UCSD until the 65lh 
minute of the contest, when Stacy 
Simmon tied the game with a fine shot 
from 18 ya rds out. 

Once awakened, the Triton offense 
continued to control the pace of the 
game. Trish Dregnam, brought in at the 
Stall of the second half, made her 
presence known qUickly enough by 
scoring the game-winner with the same 
killd of shot hI[ by Simmon. That was 
the end of the sconng, as the Triton 
defense held tight to secure the victory 
that broke the team's six-game winless 
streak. 

-Chapman wasn 't a particularly strong 
side, but I was very pleased with our 
team's ellort. We played very well ," said 
Leaney, who added drily , "We played 
very well all season wllhout much luck." 

Mercifully, perhaps, UCLA IS the 
team's last opponent, with the final 
home game Tuesday at ) :30 on Warren 
Fie ld preceding the season finale in 
Westwood on Friday. What UC 'D 
would most likc to do is get through 
those (WO games without more IIlJuries.

Bob's Book Report 

In the comic W'orld 
one name shines 

By ARTHUR SALAZAR 
Among the best choices one can make when deciding which 

comic book to read, the one most college students turn to is Cerebw 
The Aardwrk, by Dave Sim. 

The black and white book is published 15 times a year by 
Aardvark-Vanaheim Inc., where Cerebus became one of the first 
independently owned and published titles. Its main character, the 
"eanh-born pig," is out to make a fortune and earn a life of ease in a 
semi-civilized, mythic past. It is a complex, on-going story about a 
barbarian turned politician turned saint. 

The humorous book has a style with many socio-political, dark 
undertones and satires containing double meanings. It is hilariously 
good reading. The cover price is $1.70, unusual for a comic, but 
worth the price. 

Sim, who writes and pencils the book. and Gerhard, his 
collaborator, are surpassed in their field only by their own 
upcoming issues. Otherwise, nobody does it better. 

"I had a feelinl[ that there was a need for a new kind of humor in 
comic books. A feeling that everyone was just a bit weary of the • Will 
Elder' style of comic book humor adorned with signs, visual puns 
and heavy-handed parody. There was nothing wrong with this kind 
of work, but comic fans had had not~ing else for almost 30 years. 
Mad Magatine and Little Annie Fanny are still limping along 
remnants of it. We couldn't fail," said Sim. 

This month, Cerebus #66 is available, as well as a ten-page Cerebw 
story in Epic lllustrated, a fantasy and science fiction magazine. 

In issue 66, "The thrill of agony and the victo~y of defeat," Tarim 
(Cerebus), alias "most holy one," teaches a valuable lesson. "You 
can get what you want and still not be very happy," he says. Later he 
is visited by a spectral light, a UFO, and he does not know what to 
make of it. 

The Epic story spotlights a moment in Cerebus' past, where he 
learns the "evil" joys of brandy. Entitled "His First Fifth," it is 
presented entirely without written dialogue and is the first 
adventure of his done in full color. a collector's item.

possible. 

Five minutes from UCSD in La 
Jolla is one of the original Comedy 
Stores, a cabaret-type nightclub 
where all of today's brightest stand-
up comics have performed, and 
tomorrow's hopefuls display their 
wares before a live, enthusiastic 
audience. 

The Comedy Store was opened in 
the early 1970's by Sammy Shore, a 
prominent comedian, and has 
enjoyed great success. Today, many 
similar clubs have sprung up all over 
the country. UCSD students who 
come to forget their worries and 
loosen up for a few hours do just 
that, and some have profited from 
performing there. 

Jon Buchwald, a Warren College 
Senior and computer science major 
has done several spots at the Store as 
a hobby. "Most people get into the 
busines for this reason," he said. "It 
can be the greatest feeling and it can 
be most embarrassing when you 
bomb." 

From 8:30 pm until closing on 
Mondays is "Pot Luck Night" or 
amateur night. Anyone is welcome 

BV ARTHUR SALAZAR 
to try a routine for five minutes. It's 
"sink or swim" time as many people 
find out. For some, it is the start of a 
brand new career. Famous comics 
like Richard Pryor and talent scouts 
are present, always looking for new 
material this night. 

"We all start out this way, " 
comedian Carl Labove explains. 
"You do it, and you do it, and one 
day things start coming to you." 

Labove, who is living proof that no 
comic starts at the top, has gone 
through many hardships, failure 
"and a roller coaster lifestyle that 
one succeeds in only through 
straight perseverance. If you can be 
stopped from doing something, then 
you never deserved it." He will be 
starring opposite Michael Jackson in 
an upcoming movie. "I'm happy 
being a success in what I like. We all 
are, once we know what that is." 

For Labove, the key to the success 
or failure of stand-up comic lies in 
his or her being able to read the 
audience every time. Ten minutes 
after explaining his theory he proved 
it. He went on stage before 250 
people in the small, dark crowded 
room, and drew exceptional 
applause for his work.

No one can predict exactly how 
each performance will be, whether 
bad or good. and it is magical to see 
the way comedians work on live 
audience reaction . They are masters 
of improvisation, and are among the 
most finely trained actors, 
distinguished by their flare of 
uncertain ty . 

The Comedy Store is rich in 
history and one of two starting 
poin ts, the o ther on Sunset 
Boulevard in Hollywood, for many 
comics. Some of the alumni include 
Gallagher, Cheech and Chong, Jay 
Lenno, Paul Rodriguez, the late 
Andy Kaufman, Wayland Flower, 
and Mort Sahl, who last week 
appeared in La Jolla. Sahl, a political 
satirist and former speech writer for 

President John F. Kennedy, has 
inspired many topical humorists. 
"We all borrow from each other in 
some way," he said. "We must laugh 
at helpless circumstances in our 
lives, or die." The comic and his 
audience are both drained when Sahl 
asks, .. Are there any groups I haven't 
offended?" 

The Store is one of a kind in San 
Diego. Soon students will enjoy 
discounts off the cover charge and 
two-drink minimum. However you 
must be 21 years old to enter. The 
drinks are not cheap but the popcorn 
is first class Jiffy. It is open Monday 
(no cover), Wednesdays and 
Sundays at 9 pm ($4 cover), Fridays 
and Saturdays (two shows-$6 
cover). 

Oct. 25, 1984 Hiatus 3 



Do you need a Fixx? 
By FRED BERGMAN 

It's hard to find a pia e for a band 
like the Fixx. The Fixx, like the 
Police and the Pretenders, are in a 
very interesting position, in that one 
is just as likely to hear one of thdr 
singles on "The Mighty Met"as on 
KROQ. The distinction of being a 
"crossover " act in the music 
industry is an important one. In the 
case f the Fixx, however, it may 
hurt . 

Statistics show that by all 
standards the Fixx is doing quite 
well. Its first album, 'hutrl"reJ Room , 
stayed on the U .. charts for nearly a 
year the second album, Reach the 
Beach, went platinum and the latest 
endeavor, Pha ntom 's, has yielded a 
hit single. All of this has been 
accomplished in just the past two 
years. 

Some locals to the San Diego area 
will recall the first rour that brought 
the Fixx to an Diego. They played 
an opening slot at SDSU's 
Amphitheater and were asked back 
to play two shows at the Rodeo the 
following week . Contracts were 
signed, promises were made but on 
the date of the show the band refused 
to perform, saying that the stage at 
the Rodeo was too small. 

Though this proble m was 
corrected, the Fixx would not 
concede to perform even though 
both shows had sold out and there 
were anxious concert-goers waiting 
ro check out a new band. The club 
lost out on drink revenues the 
promoter lost a $1500 deposit with 
the booking agency as well as 
advertising costs and the Fixx 
disappointed potential fans. This 

c uld be een a a very eriou career 
move for the band. Perhaps the Fixx, 
like most groups involved in the 
musi lIldustry, did not view San 
Diego as being a viable market. ales 
for Friday' upcoming show will give 
an indication of whether this is true 
or not . 

Are San Diegans ready to pay 
$13.50 to see the Fixx? The album 
may be doing well in other parts of 
the country and the Fixx may be able 
to sell lots and lots of expensive 
tickets in Los Angeles but that does 
not warrant the high artist fees that 
they are asking. Chiding the Fixx for 
having a success without developing 
a history or " paying the dues" may 
be a bit harsh . 

On its own, its music shows 
areful compos ition, clean, tight 

production and an empa th y for 
meaningful lyrics. O n the o ther 
hand, it might just as well be branded 
as formulated mainstream pop. In a 
recent interview that appeared in the 
an Diego Union, Cy Cumin (lead 

vocalist and lyricist) stated, "You're 
never too sure why you're being 
liked, so you can't hang your hopes 
just on what you're doing." He 
added, .. 'It's important that we [the 
ba n d] stay aware of th e 
competition .... W e' re pleased that 
we've come this far, but we figure we 
might as well use our strength to 
maintain this position now." 
cont inued to be touted. 

The Fixx will play along with 
special guests on Friday in the gym . 
Tickets are $13 .50 general 
admission. For further information

A tThief' is a thief 
By ETHAN FEERST 

Steven Bauer), a handsome young 
professional thief. 

Writer director !)ouglas Day 
Stewart's Thief of Hearts is a pathetic 
attempt to portray the frustrations 
and fantasies of Mickey Davis 
(Ca nadi an actress Barbar a 
Williams), a woman trapped in the 
confines of a "perfect" marriage. 
The set-up is insultingly simple. 
Mickey's husband is a self-absorbed 
author of children's books, 
constantly trapped behind tiny, 
round, studious spectacles. While 
they are on their sixth anniversary 
din ner date, their beautiful 
surburban designer home-and 
marriage-is disturbed by Scott 
Muller (portrayed by Scarface's 

Among the many valuables he 
takes, are Mickey 's diaries, her other 
self, her alter-ego, the pages where 
she calls herself " Michelle ." He 
learns she does not like men who 
smoke. He learns she likes men who 
let her pick up the check. He learns 

f many more earth-shaking secrets 
uch as these. And he plots to seduce 

her (he'll pose as a client for 
Mickey's new interior decorating 
service ). 

Sre\len &uer begiN his seduction of Rarbara Willianv in 'Thief of Hearu! 

Mysteriously, as the handsome 
young prince/ thief is reading her 
diaries, she knows they are being 

read. til can feel him turning the 
pages," she writes in her new entry. 
How does she know? Why does he 
card 

After a point, the whole thing 
seems ridiculously amoral. Mickey 

cheats on her nerdy husband. She is 
sorry. He is sorry for being a self-
absorbed nerd . They make up. There 
is something else that deals with the 
redemption of a guilty thief. For 
futher details, see the movie.

An evening 
with a 
tlandmark' 

By CATHY CHARLES 
The titles Oklahoma!, Carousel and 

Paint Your Wagon instantly bring to 
mind great Broadway musicals that 
have encapsulated the true essence of 
the heartland of America. On 
Friday, the renowned veteran of the 
dance world who choreographed 
these classic American works will be 
fea tured in the lectu re i fit m 
presentation tI An Evening with 
Agnes de Mille" at Mandeville 
Auditorium. De Mille will lecture on 
such topics as her contributions to 
American dance, the state of the art 
dance and will discuss her strong 
opposition to the "corporatization" 
of the performing arts. 

Throughout her career, which has 
encompassed nearly fifty years, her 
work has focused on "quintessen-
tially" American themes and 
choreography influenced by 
American folk dance. Her most 
famous works were considered 
milestones of their time and genre, 
Rodeo, of 1940, which was a 
"revol utionary" contemporary 
ballet, created for the American 
Ballet Theater, of which she was a 
founding member; and Oklahoma!, 
which was a "landmark of modern 
dance for the theater ." 

"An Evening with Agnes de 
Mille" will take place at 8 pm on 
Friday, October 26, in Mandeville 
Auditorium. Tickets can be 
purchased through the UCSD Box

For Bob Sullivan

By ROBIN SCOTT 

some though ts about my feelings, 
some feelings about my though ts, 
some thoughts about my suspicion, 
etc." Delivered in rapid-fire 
succession, Sulliva n succeeds with 
these lines to convey a sense of 
thwarted communication in the face 
of emotional uncertainty. 

Another effe tive use of repetition 
comes at the brink of a break-up, 
when Sullivan, t he distraught lover 
be oming neurotic in his need to 

mannequin (one of the few props) 
communi ates the revere nce toward 
his lover tha t occasionally overtakes 
him. When reci ting lines oncern ing 
his overwhelming despai r at a fi nal 
pa rting, Sul livan pos itions himself 
face down o n the floor . A 
pa rticu larly clever use of body 
movement comes when Sull ivan, 
attempting to entice his departing 
lover to reconsider by promising a 
return to past happiness, perfor ms a 

it appears that Matthew Arnold 
was not the only one who felt poetry 
is inconsistent with the modern age. 
Judging by the attendance at Sushi 
last Friday evening, this attitude still 
prevails. 

Less than ten people turned out to 
witness noted poet Bob Sullivan 
perform The Long Whire Dress of 
Looe, a solo dramatization of his own 
writings. The lack of attendance in 
no way represented the quality of the 
piece', nor did it interfere with the 
intensity with which Sullivan 
delivered it. The work is an extensive 
and chillingly revealing catalogue of 
romantic emotions. The subject 
matter was so completely exhausted 
that the viewer felt spent by the end 
of the performance. The key to the 
success of the work is in the use of 
repetition, beyond the point of 
absurdity, and the carefully executed 
body movements of the performer 
heightened by an apt use of props 
and an inventive soundtrack. 

consists of a dozen or so short pieces, 
each adopting a distinct angle on the 
"love" relationship. Sullivan takes 
the viewer on a journey into the 
psyche of the lover from the 
inhibition of a first date, through the 
helplessness of a final break up. 
Infatuation, security, insecurity, 
sexual bliss, wonder, disdain, and 
despair are all deftly examined. 
Sullivan accordingly transformed 
himself to accommodate the mood 
of each piece. The smaller pieces all 
shared similar elements that 
contribute to the work as a whole. 

HThat 's my chair, this is my place, you're going to have 
to vacate the premises . . . That's my chair." 

reaffir m himself by defining his 
i)OSsessions, addresses his lo ver with 
"That's my chair, this is my place, 
you're going to have to leave ... This 
is my place, you're going to have to 
vacate the prem ises ... This is my 
place, tha t 's my chair ... That's my 
chair!' The work was so completely 
infested with repetition that two 
examples can only hint as to the 
nature of its use. 

The Long White Dress of Love 

Repetition is one instrument upon 
which he strongly relies. It 
emphasizes how absurd the behavior 
patterns of a lover can be when 
entangled in an emotiona l web. 
When preparing to discuss a snag in 
the relationship, Sullivan declares, 
"These are just my thoughts ... 
These are just my feelings ... These 
are just my suspicions ... T hese are 
just my thoughts, just my feeli ngs, 
just my suspicions . .. These are just 

Combined with repetition is a 
keen use of body positions that 
corresponded to specific emotions .

initial inhibitio n. A position of 
kneeli ng before a sy m bolic

The Eatbeat affections. The props were more a 

backgro und fo r ull ivan than an· 
integral pa rt of the work itself. 

The wide range of em tions that 
Sull ivan worked o ut are matched by 
an equa l ly comprehensive 
sound track, performed by John 
Densmore, former drummer of the 
Doors . Densmore composed soft 
and subtle, as well as pensive and 
chaotic pieces, clearly more 
competent with the latter. At times 
the music seems to upstage Sullivan, 
but overall it is complementary to 
the work. Sulliva n never seems to 
rely on the music to evoke emotions 
that his words cannot. The 
sound track was more a compilat ion 
of unstruc tured sounds that 
fo llowed the tone he set forth . 

Eat at Ma's 
getting your daily dose. The egg rolls 
arc her specialty; deep fried with lots 
of grease, but hey, they have eggs, 
cabbage, and a lot of other good 
vegetab le-looking stuff too. The 
grease just helps improve the taste. 

The fr ied chicken is good. I do not 
know what part of the chicken it is, 
but it is shaped like a popsicle so you 
can hold onto the bone part like a 
stick and eat the chicken on the other 
end-like ice cream. It 's a lot of fun. 
The breading on the chicken has a 
dim orange tint to it , probably from 
MSG. 

Perhaps more has been written on 
the subject. of lo ve than o n any 
other. I am sure Sullivan will not 
have the final word o n love. 
However, judging by his vas t 
trea tment of the subject , this surely 
was his intent. The subject matter is 
complex, the treatment is complete . 
Sullivan, in a gripping del ivery, 
replayed for viewers their own past 
romantic interludes. The Long White 
Dress of Love is a journey into 
perhaps the most universal and least 
u n de r s tood o f a ll human 
experiences.

PEACE 
CORPS 

Special Work 
For Spedal People 

Peace Corps volunteers are 
peopk pretty much like you. P~o­
pie with commitment and skills who 
have assessed their lives and decided 
they want to be of service to others 
in a troubled world. 

The problems our volunteers 
deal with overseas aren't new. Such 
as the cycle of poverty that traps one 
generation after another because 
they're too busy holding on to get 
ahead. The debilitating effects of 
malnutrition, disease, and inade-
quale shelter. Education and skills 
that are lacking, and the means to 
get them too. 

Your college training qualifies 
you to handle more of these pro~ 
lems than you might think. Such as 
teaching nutrition and health prac-
tices; designing and building bridges 
and irrigation systems; working on 
reforestation and fisheries pro-

grams; introducing better agricul-
tural techniques; advising small 
businesses and establishing coopera-
tives; or teaching math and science 
at the secondary level. 

The number of jobs to do is 
nearly as great as the number of vol-
unteers who have served since 1961 : 
Nearly 90.000. More volunteers are 
being chosen now for two-year 
assignments beginning in Ihe next 
3-12 months in Africa, Asia, Latin 
America, and the Pacific. 

Our representatives will be 
pleased to discuss the opportunities 
with you.

ends up giving you mostly ice and 
just a swallow of water. Without 
water you cannot cool off a hot bite 
of food that you just put in your 
mouth, and ice just does not work 
fast enough. 

What is especially great about 
Ma's place is that the food is never 
too hot to begin with. It's constantly 
kept at a perfect temperature under 
heat lamps, so you never have to eat 
food that is too hot . 

I really hate it when restaurants 
dim the ligh ts, too. Everything is so 
dull and drab, and I always feel like I 
have to keep my voice down. Ma's is 
well lit with no secluded booths to 
keep people from being their own, 
loud selves. The tables are colored 
bright orange and are shaped like 
those in high school cafeterias. There 
are not many, but Ma's has friendly 
people who are always willing to 
share their tables with you. 

Ma's vegetable dishes are O K, but 
her fried food is the best, and since 
there are vegetables in her egg rolls, 
you don't have to worry about not 

Advertise in ... , 

To me, Ma's means freedom. Just 
the fact that you can make up your 
own plates shows an encouragement 
of creative talent. Some like to make 
their plates pretty by placing the rice 
in the middle and all the other 
dishes, such as red sweet and sour 
pork and gree n chop suey, 
symmetrically around it to create a 
sort of Chinese rai nbow. O ther like 
to just pile their food into a great 
heap of majestic proportion. For me, 
I just like to build a mound of fried 
food, creating a golden mountain 
that glimmers in the light. That along 
with a Coors beer and life just does 
not get much better than tha t. To get
