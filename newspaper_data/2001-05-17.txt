KSDT to Split From SRTV 
Decision will ensure more equitable split of resources for both 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

As of next year, KSDT will no 
longer share station 18 wi th 
SRTV, and it will only be broad-
cast through its Web site. 

The change will also result 
in separate budgets for each 
organization. Both groups are 
currently part of the umbrella 
organization Student Cable 
Works, which is funded by the 
A.S. Council Previously, both 
organizations shared one bud-
get for Student Cable Works. 

Student Cable Works 
General Manager Jeff Pease said 
it makes sense to split up the 
operations. 

"SRTV has such big plans, 
they thought it would be easier if 
we took their portion of the bud-
get from the radio station: Pease 
said. 

Pease commented that SRTV 
will be expanding its operations 
and acting as a service to student 
organizations. 

"SRTV will go ou! and film 
events on campus for free," Pease 
said, elaborating on SRTV's 
future plans. 

"Because of underhanded and 
overhanded cuts, [SRTV] will 
also not be on Cox Cable: said 
KSDT Operations Manager Peter 
Bejarano at Tuesday's SRTV gen-
eral staff meeting. 

He noted that SRTV focused 
more on consumer program-
ming, making it more pertinent 
to UCSD students. 

Bejarano said that the KSDT 
budget will decrease because of 
the split, but that the action will 
result in benefits for the radio 
station. 

"[The split] will offer us !\lore 
freedom, because before, we had 
to closely monitor the DJs: he 
said. 

Bejarano said that because 
the station is Internet-powered, 
KSDT will have "the freedom to 
reach people who want to lis-
ten." 

He said the KSDT Web site 

will archive sample shows, each 
show will have its own Web 
page, and listeners will be able 
to participate in live chats with 
the Djs. 

Bejarano added that the 
KSDT studio will revert to a 
recording studio. 

"Bands can come in to cut 
professional demos," Bejarano 
said. 

A.S. Commissioner of 
Services and Enterprises Colin 
Parent said that the move was 
meant to be fair to both parties. 

"There was a concern that 
KSDT was getting more than its 
fai r share of the resources," 
Parent said. He was referring to 
the organizations' shared budget, 
which totaled approximately 
$18,726 last year. 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge 
said the budget split would be 
benefi cial to both organiza tions. 
He explai ned that under the old , 
shared budget, Student Cable

Man Falls From 1-5 Overpass 
IyDANA WE.' 
Staff Writer 

UCSD police reported that a 
man fell from the Voigt Drive 
bridge crossing Interstate 5 early 
Tuesday morning. The police 
have not revealed the man's iden-
tity, but he has been described as 
38 yea~ old and unaffiliated with 
the university .• 

The victim suffered a broken 
leg and internal injuries. He was 
transported to Scnpps Memorial 

Hospital for treatment. • 
According to Detective 

Douglas O'Dell of the UCSD 
Police Department, the man was 
suffering from dizziness. 

"The injured party claimed 
he got dizzy and fell off the 
bridge into the center divide 
area .Df th e freeway," O'Dell 
said. "He did not indicate that 
he was suicidal. He sa id that he 
became dizzy and literally fell off 
the bridge as he was walking 
across, and there do not appear 

to be any witnesses who can say 
otherwise. " 

Because there is no evidence 
suggesting anything other than 
an accidental fall, police do not 
have"a crimi nal investigation 
underway. The UCSD police 
department wi ll take an injury 
report and send copies of it to 
Risk Management to assess any 
repairs that need to be made. No 
such report has been filed yet, 
although staff members stated 
that they plan to begin one soon.

"The rescinding has done away 
with admitting students based 
solely on academic criteria: 
Backer said. "The purpose of it 
was to let underrepresented stu-
dents know that UC is a friend ly 
place." 

According to Backer, SP- l and 
SP-2 discouraged minority appli-
ca nts from enrolling in UC 
schools. 

"When SP- l and SP-2 were 
passed in, [underrepresented stu-
dents[ got the impression that 
they were not welcome at the UC 
system." Backer said. "The regents 
are sending what they believe to 
be a clear message." 

To ensure that the university is 
a friendly place for under-repre-
sented students, RE-28 also stipu-
lates that " the university shall 
have programs available to assist 
in the retention of all students so 
as to assure that they successfully 
complete their education." 

The UC Academic Senate will 
be responsible for creating the 
new admissions criteria . Members 
have already been asked by UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson in 
a Feb. 15 letter to review admis-
sions cri teria. That review is

vague Measure 
Misleads Students 

The UC Regents repealed SP-1 and SP-2 
Wednesday, ending the University of Cali-
fornia's ban on race-based admissions and 
hiring processes with the implementation of 
a new measure called RE-28. State laws 
against affirmative action, however, ensure 
that the repeal of these measures wi ll not 
affect UC admissions and hiring practices. 

Although the Guardian supportS the 
rescindment of SP-1 and SP-2, we retain 
one concern with the regents' decision. 

The UC Regents passed SP-l and SP-2 
in 1995 of their own accord, before the state 
placed its ban on affirmative action with 
Proposition 209 in 1996. The Guardian feels 
that by repealing SP-1 and SP-2 now, when 
state law ensures that affi rmative action will 
have no place in university admissions and 
hiring, is a backhanded way to remove the 
regents from the center of California's affir-
mative action debate. 

It is widely known that the regents have 
been under attack since passing SP-1 and 
SP-2, and it is convenient that they repeal 
these policies at a time when state law 
makes any such repeal purely a symbolic 
geslure. 

In short, the regents arc simply passing 
the buck to California's voters, since Propo-
sition 209 can only be repealed or modifn::d 
through a voter initiative. Essentially, the 
rcpeal of SP-1 and SP-2 is almost meaning-
less without a repeal of Proposition 209. 

However, the Guardian recognizes that 
the rescindment has great symbolic weight, 
and for that reason we support the decision 
in light of all its political purposes. 

Since 1995, members of the University of 
California community have argued that SP-
1 and SP-2 were sending a clear message to 
under-represented groups: Minorities were 
unwelcome on the UC campuses not nec-
essarily due to state law, but due to the Uni-
versity of California's own stance against 
affirmative action. 

Ending those policies should very well 
end that negative message. 

The Guardian feels that the Wednesday 
reversal of SP-l and SP-2 was undoubtedly 
politically motivated, and perhaps was 
accomlished only because state law dictates 
that the move would bring no changes to

Breaking Out the Paddle: Corporal 
Punishment . Thrives in America 

In many states across the South, children face harsh phYSical punishments for 
small infractions that do not warrant such a cruel and primitive measure 

By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Every day, school children in Georgia, 
Texas, Louisiana and 20 other states 
across the South live with the threat of 
being physically assaulted, often with a 
wooden paddle, at the hands of school 
administrators and teachers. 

It completely shocks me that the gov-
ernment will not step in and stop corpo-
ral punishment in our schools. What also 
stuns me is that corporal punishment is 
legal in public schools in 23 states. It is 
committed with the full sanction of the 
law. 

Once the shock wore away, anger set 
in and I couldn't stop myself from dig-
ging until I exposed the whole, ugly 
truth. 

The reality in which these children 
live is scary. Whether it is elbowing 
another child, passing a note, getting up 
without permission or ignoring direc-
tions, small infractions can earn corporal 
punishment for a child. 

Take the example of a fourth grader, 
Megan Cahan in, who was paddled by the 
school principle for elbowing a friend in 
the cafeteria. She received the customary 
three whacks on her behind with a 3 inch 
by 15 inch wooden paddle. When her 
parents saw the purple, doughnut-
shaped bruises on her behind, they filed 
suit against the Georgia school district in 
which the altercation took place. 

The Cahanin lawsuit argues that cor-
poral punishment violates the guarantee 
of equal protection, since it is illegal to 
hit prisoners, nursing home re.~idents or 
children in foster care. 

So far, the courts have not agreed 
with extending die guarantee of equal 
protection to school children . 

In fac t, the Supreme Court ruled in 
1977's l71graham v. Wright, that the Eighth 
Amendment, which prohibits cruel and 
unusual punishment, applies to convict-
ed crimll1als but not to students. 

Robert Fathman, president of the 
National Coalition to Abolish Corporal 
Punishment in Schools said that almost 
every democracy in the world has 
banned corporal punishment but that 

the United States is going in the opposite 
directions. 

"You can't whack a prisoner, but you 
can whack a kindergarten child," Fath-
man said. 

Children need equal protection under 
law. Just as a prisoner is at the mercy of 
the guards or law for his well-being, the 
children in those 23 states are at the 
mercy of those in charge of the school. 
At any point during the day, for the 
smallest infraction , these children's 
rights are smashed to bits with the blows 
from that wooden paddle. 

There is plenty of evidence to con-
vince a reasonable person that school 
children are entitled protection from this 
primitive and unconscionable practice of 
corporal punishment. 

Yet the fact that the Supreme Court 

The purpose of government is 
to protect those who are weak 
and defenseless from being 
abused. It is the government's 
duty to protect the life and 
the rights of everyone in our 
nation ... Aren't children the 
most exploitable group in our 
society? 
has turned a blind eye to children's right 
to learn in an environment free from 
abuse makes the court a conspirator in 
the continued abuse of school children 
across our nation. 

The purpose of government is to pro-
tect those who are weak and defenseless 
from being abused. It is the govern-
ment's duty to protect the life and the 
rights of everyone in our nation. 

So why do those lofty principles of 
protecting the rights of all come to a full 
and complete stop when they are applied 
to children? Aren't children the most 
exploitabl group in our society? 

Why does our government continue 
to abuse our children under the guise of 

corporal punishment? How can the gov-
ernment justify its use· of abuse as an 
acceptable punishment on school chil-
dren? 

According to a recent Nt:W York Times 
article, some school districts and states 
insist that corporal punishment is neces-
sary to maintain order. As sickening as it 
seems, it was reported that corporal pun-
ishment is a treasured tradition in the 
South. 

Robert S urgenor, a detective from 
Berea, Ohio who investigates corporal 
punishment cases, claims that paddling 
works because, "pain is the most effective 
form of punishment." 

Pain is the most effective tool? Give 
me a break. 

Pain scars, Mr. Surgenor. It doesn't 
teach kids to be obedient; it just trains 
kids to temporarily outwit the pain or to 
shutdown so as to avoid it. 

Many experts argue that corporal 
punishment can cause depression or can 
worsen existing aggression. 

Corporal punishment is a dangerous 
lesson to teach in schools. Experts say 
that paddling perpetuates a cycle of vio-
lence, teaching children that violence is 
the appropriate tool for managing the 
behavior of others. 

Violence in the form of corporal pun-
ishment should not be promoted as the 
effective solution for student misbehav-
ior, especially in the view of the recent 
school shootings. 

Corporal punishment's devastating 
effects can be seen in Cahanin's life. She 
has started biting her nails and tries every 
morning to avoid going to school. 

In an interview with the N~ York 
Times, Cahanin said, "It's so painful see-
ing [the principall every day. Whenever I 
see a paddle, I just move away." 

Cahanin is only one example of a 
child forever scarred by corporal punish-
ment. There are hundreds of thousands 
of kids who have also been abused at 
school because of corporal punishment. 
According to Department of Education 
research from the 1996-1997 school year 
365,000 children faced corporal punish-

Ignorance Fuels Stereotypes 
Tom's 
Trials 

TOM VU 

I recently read a rather dis-turbing article in the Los Angeles Times. The April 25 
article, titled "To Be Chinese in 
America," written by Lisa 
Richardson and Hilary MacGre-
gor, is about a recent poll on how 
Americans view Chinese-Ameri-
cans. The poll was taken before 
the incident over the spy plane. 

In March, the poll, sponsored 
by the Committee of 100 (a Chi-
nese-American leadership orga-
nization) telephoned 1,216 peo-
ple nationwide and asked them 
various questions about their 
feelings regarding Chinese-
Americans. The answers are, to 
say the least, frightening because 
"it burst a long-simmering bub-
ble of frustration: as the writers 
pilt it. 

One-third of the respondents 
questioned Chinese-Americans' 
loyalty to the United States. Most 
Chinese people here in the Unit-
ed States are here for a reason: 
They don't want to live in China 
under communist oppression. 
One-quarter claim to have "very 
negative attitudes" toward Chi-
nese-Americans; all ! can do is 

shake my head and wonder 
where race relations have gone in 
the 50 years since the immigra-
tion laws against Asians were 
finally lifted. 

True, only 1,216 people were 
polled, and how accurately such 
a small sample can predict the 
true feelings of 281 million peo-
ple has to be questioned, but the 
poll does bring up interesting 
questions and has, as the old say-
ing goes, opened up a large can 
of worms. It brings into the Iime-

All I can do is shake 
my head and wonder 
where race relations 
have gone in the 50 
years since the 
immigration laws 
against Asians were 
finally lifted. 
light how Asians (not just Chi-
nese) are still regarded as the 
"enemy: how America continu-
ously upholds the view of Asians 
as "forever foreigners" and how 
the "yellow peril" hysteria has 
taken over this nation once 
again, when one considers the 
backlash Asian-Americans have 
received lately. 

If you're Asian, I'm sure 

you're nodding your head right 
now. If you're not Asian - well, 
white - you're probably scratch-
ing your head right now But 
that's the main issue here, isn 't 
it? 

But I'm not going to debate 
here. You can take an ethnic 
studies class next quarter or pro-
fessor Lisa Lowe's excellent Eng-
lish Literature 18 class. 

The point of this article is to 
ask: How the hell am I supposed 
to react? How am I supposed to 
feel? Angry? Threatened? pisap-
pointed that there has been no 
evolution in the last 50 years in 
the way Americans feel about 
Asians, as is evidenced by the 
recent racist backlash? 

The simplicity and blind 
ignorance of some people utterly 
amazes me. Last week, I was on 
the No. 34 bus, going from cam-
pus back to my apartment. At the 
stop closest to Roosevelt college, 
a white guy and his friend, both 
UCSD students, got on, 

From then until my stop at 
the corner of Nobel Drive and 
Lebon Drive, all I heard him say 
to his impish friend was, "Yeah 
those Charlie Chan fucks ... took 
our plane .. . (ucking Charlie 
Chan .. ." Whether he meant for 
me to hear his choice words, ! 
don't know, but it was hard for 
me not to notice. All his friend

DoMe

JACOB WASSERMAN 

A rc you hungry? I'm hungry. Sevcnth week always makes me hun-
gry. And not just for food, though 
a good vegan bean and rice burri-
to hits the spot. \'m hungry for the 
joyously neat things that on ly 
UCSD can offer. 

Maybe you're scratching your 
head in befuddlement. "Cool stuff 
at UCSD? Not under this sU!3-
pressivc administration." Maybe 
those aren't your exact words, but 
we all know the apathetic senti-
ments that threaten to drown any 
voice of fun around here. 

In a series of four columns 
over these last four weeks of the 
quarter, I'm going to call on all of 
you to hclp me resuscitate the life 
of this school. You may know me 
from previous columns, such as 
"The Top 10 Things You Have to 
Do While At UCSD," or from one 
of my various Get-Fun·Quick-

front of Center Hall: I'm perpetu-
ally hungry for excitement and 
entertainment.

sports, or you despise the Price 
Center, or you want Division II 
funds and a new mall on campus 
but none of that social services 
junk. Or maybe you voted for Joe 
Watson and Tommy Tucker's 
Price Center Expansion, pork bar-
rel and all , because you're in favor 

of all of the above. Get involved. 
Committees are conveni ng, 

groups are gathering, and if you 
don't show up to share your 
views, someone's going to claim to 
be speaking for you. Maybe me. 
You have no idea how exciting it is 
to stand up at one of these meet-
ings and pretend to be SlJeaking 
fo r hundreds. When I'm hungry 
for that special public speaking 
buzz, nothing else hits the spot. 

But I'm also hungry for justice, 
and for socially progressive view-

"We can change the world" opti-
mism that filled the Price Center 
when Ozomatli came by. There's 
only one place on campus offering 
that on a regular basis, and its the 
Che Cafe.

lightly, the injustice of it is still pre-
sent , as in all cases of discrimina-
tion. 

What happened that unfortu-
nate night to make me feel -so 
slighted? It had to do with alcohol. 
(Of course-what else could it be 
about?) 

Yes, I am underage (a minuscule 
20 years old.) But that is beside the 
point. 

The point is that I was merely 
the companion of someone legal-
ly able to purchase alcohol. And 
although he was over 21, he was 
not allowed to purchase the 
drinks at Sav-On because his 
underage friend didn 't feel like 
waiting in the car by herself so 
late at night. 

The manager claimed that the 
alcohol was a dual purchase, and 
therefore he would need to see 
both of our identification cards. 

Where does the law c1aiJTl that, 
in order to purchase alco~ol. you 
need to be of legal' drinking age and 
have no friends that are underage? 
Where in Sav-On does it say that 
all alcohol purchases made by 
more than one person require the 
identification cards of all persons

And how far does this rule 

extend? 
If I was purchasing some beer 

with my father, would they check 
my ID? What if my Dad sent my 
older brother and me to get some 
beer because we were running low 
at the barbecue? If my 8-year-old 
sister were to go to the store wi th 
me, would she have to show ID? 
Or should I leave her wandering 
alone all over the Sav-On play-
ground? Should I dump her in the 
car while I go get my drinks? 

Tell me, whl;re does this mad-
ness end? The manager claimed 
that he was technically selling it to 
a minor. 

He was selling it to the person 
who paid for it, not little me. I was 
just standing beside the legal pur-
chaser. Why must innocent peo-
ple be persecuted because they 
associate with others younger 
than theyare?_ 

The whole point of this letter-
to-the-editor rampage: Either boy-
cott the crappy, un refrigerated 
alcohol at Sav-On and purchase 
the nice, cold drinks at Albertson 's 
and Ralphs instead, or leave all 
underage friends in the gutter 
when purchasing alcohol there. 
Either way, it saves us all the 
anguish of discrimination .

Punishment:

punishment must stop

ment. 

That should make 365,000 
assault convictions against the 
school administrators, right? Nope 
- in those 23 states, assault on 
children is lega l. 

The number of children facing 
corporal punishment in these 
schools should be zero. We have no 
excuse for punishing children with 
violence in schools: If prisoners are 
afforded the right to be protected 
from cruel and unusual punish-
ment, so should children. Corporal 
punishment must be outlawed. We 
must protect our children .

states: Let us break the chain of 
abuse. Let us break those wooden 
paddles.

happy being blind. 

So how am I supposed to feel? Angry? 
Yes, at first. Annoyed? Yes. A little sorry for

What's the moral of these stories? This 
country is still far from being raci~lIy toler-
ant. There is a lot of pent-up anger and 
frustration on behalf of the dominant cul-
ture. 

From our fellow college students to jour-
nalists that say on television, "Chinese are 
not nice people," to our own leaders, there 
are a lot of people building up a stash of gun-
powder, ready to blow, behind a friendly 
smile. 

The sooner we acknowledge this, the. 
faster the fuse can be blown out. I would 
hate to see what the poll responses would be 
if it had been taken after the spy plane inci-
dent.

ORLD & NATION 
Senate Committee 
Approves Tax Cut 

WASHINGTON - Legislation 
that would lower the taxes of all 
Americans who owe income taxes 
cleared the Senate Finance 
Commlllee Tuesday night, moving it 
one more step toward enactment. 

The measure contains the 
e 'sence of the tax paokage 
PreSident Bush campaigned for last 
year and proposed to Congress this 
year as hiS top legislatiw priority. 

Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, 
the Republican leader, said he 
hoped the Senate would pass the 
bill this week, work out differe nces 

proposed. 
The Senate bi ll would give 

almost all income-tax payers a tax 
cut this year of at least $300 for 
single people and $600 for cou-
ples. That would be accompl ished 
by reducing the tax rate to 10 per-
cent from 15 percent on the first 
$6,000 of taxable income fo r indi-
viduals and $12,000 for couples. 
The lower taxes would be reflect-
ed in smaller amounts withheld 
from workers' paychecks. The 
House is expected to go along 
wi th this. 

with the House of 
Representatives 
next week and have 
the measure ready 
for the president'S 
signature before 
Memorial Day. 

Both houses of 
Congress approved 
budget resolutions 

In addition, the tax 
credit for each child 
would be raised to 
$600 from $500 
this year.. 

In addition, the 
tax credit for each 
child would be 
raised to $600 from 
$500 this year. 

Begi nning next 
year, tax rates 
would be reduced 
across the board, 
with the top rate 

last week that ensured that the 
biggest tax reduction in two 
decades would become law, giving 
the president a strong political vic-
tory. The only remaining questions 
involve deta ils. 

In the Finance Committee 
Tuesday, four of the 10 Democrats 
joined all 10 Republicans in favor 
of the measure. With the Senate 
divided SO to SO, the Democratic 
support in the committee essential-
ly guarantees the bill will be 
approved by the Senate without 
significant change. 

But because the House has 
already passed its tax cut mea-
sures, the final answer on impor-
tan t details like what the top tax 
ra te will be and how quickly some 
of th e cuts will come will be 
decided in th e Senate-House con-
fe rence committee. The tax cut 
measures approved by the House 
are even closer than the Senate 
measure to what the president

In addition to the rate reduc-

deduction for college tui tion pay-
ments, increase the amount of

tive minimum tax and give more 
favorable tax treatment to pensions

The measure would also offer 
important new assistance to low-
and moderate- income families with 
children.

Gadhafi Admitted Libyan Link 
to Berlin Bombing, Lawyer Says 

FRANKFURT, Germany -
Citing what he said was a confi-
dential telegram sent by German 
diplomats, a lawyer in Berl in said 
Tuesday that libya 'S leader, 
Moammar Gadhafi, admitted to a 
top German official that his gov-
ernment was involved in the 1986 
bombing of a Berlin discotheque 
that killed th ree people and 
wounded many others. 

The lawyer, Andreas Schulz, 
who represents victims and fami-
lies of victims in the bombing, 
said he had received a copy of a 
message that summarized a con-
versation that Gadhafi had earlier 
this year with Michael Steiner, a 
top foreign policy adviser to 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. 
Steiner, in turn, passed on the 
highlights of that conversation to 
President Bush when he and 
~chroeder visited the Whi te 
House on March 29. 

If the telegram is authentic, it 
could give advocates of the bomb-
ing victims a new opportunity to 
sue the Libyan government for 

compensation in Germ an or 
American courts. It could also put 
the German government in an 
awkward position, because it has 
long chafed at sanctions against 
Libya, and German companies 
have been eager to expand their 
dealings with the country. 

Five Libyans are on trial · for 
their role in bombing the La Belle 
discotheque, then a popular night 
spot for American soldiers. Three 
people were killed and hundreds 
were injured. The trial of the five 
men has been under way in Berlin 
since 1997, and it is expected to 
continue until some time this fa ll. 

But German prosecutors have 
little direct evidence that the 
Libyan government and Gadhafi 
actually ordered the bombings. 

Schulz quoted from a memo 
sent by the German ambassador 
in Washington, Juergen Chrobog, 
who was recounting the high-
lights of Schroeder's meeting 
with Bush on March 29. 
According to that memo, Steiner 
described a meeting he had with 

Gadhafi in the Libya n capital of 
Tripoli two weeks earlier. Steiner 
reportedly said that the Libyan 
leader admitted his government's 
complicity in both the dis-
cotheque bombing as well as the 
1988 bombing of Pan Am pas-
senger jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. 

A spokesman for Chancellor 
Schroeder, Uwe-Karsten Heye, 
confirmed Tuesday that Steiner 
held a confide ntial -meeting with 
Gadhafi and they discussed the 
topic of terrorism. But he said the 
two men had not discussed indi-
vidual cases. 

Schulz said the telegram told a 
different story. According to 
Schulz, the te legram reported 
back to the Foreign Ministry in 
Berlin that Steiner "reponed on 
his talks with Qaddafi in Libya. 
He acknowledged that Libya par-
ticipated in terrorist actions (La 
Belle, Lockerbie}."

Fed Lowers Interest Rates Again 
WASHINGTON - The Federal 

Reserve continued its campaign to 
reinvigorate the weakened econo-
my Tuesday, cutting its benchmark 
interest rate half a percentage point 
for the fifth time this year. 

Suggesting that the worst of 
the slowdown may still not be 
past, the Fed said its decision was 
primarily driven by the deteriorat-
ing outlook for businesses, which 
have been cutting investments in 
new plants and equipment in the 
face of declining profits. 

Tuesday's action reduced the 
federal funds rate on overnight 
loans among banks to 4 percent, 
from 4.5 percent. 

The decision brought the total 
reduction since the Fed began 
cutting rates in January to 2.5 per-
centage points. And the central 
bank, dismissing any concern that 
inflation might become a threat, 
hinted that it was likely to ease 
monetary policy further at itS next 
scheduled meeting in late June. 

Wall Street bid up stock prices 
after the announcement at 2: 1 5 
p.m. But prices then fell back and 

Fraud: 
The company's financial 
recovery was false 
ContInued from ,.,. 1 
the name of efficiency. Sunbeam's 
stock leaped nearly 50 percent the 
day he was hired to run the com-
pany in 1996. But the SEC suit, 
filed in federal co un in Miami, 
said the Sunbeam turnaround 
directed by Dunlap was a sham. 

The executives "orchestrated a 
fraudulent scheme to create the 
illusion of a successful restructur-
ing of Sunbeam and facilitate the 
sale of the company at an inflated 
price," the SEC said. 

Sunbeam , a maker of such 
products as Sunbeam electric 
blankets and Oster blenders, is 
now in bankruptcy reorganization. 

Dunlap, who was fired from 
Sunbeam in the summer of 1998, 
said he would figh t the accusa-
tions, as did four other former 
top officials of the company and 

finished flat. The Dow Jones 
industrial average slipped 4.36 
points, closing at 10,872.97; the 
Nasdaq composite index rose 3.66 
points, to 2,085.58. 

The Fed's action was intended 
to put downward pressure on bor-
rowing costs throughout the 
economy, making it more afford-
able for consumers to buy a car or 
a new refrigerator as well as pro-
viding them with some assurance 
that their own financial situation 
would not worsen. 

That process was under way 
within minutes. when banks began 
reducing their prime lending rates 
to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, a 
step that most directly affects small-
business borrowers but also helps 
consumers who have certain types 
of credit cards, auto loans and 
adjustable mongages. 

Ultimately, the cumulative 
reductions in the short-term rates 
controlled by the Fed should have 
some impact on a wide variety of 
loans. But they will have only an 
indirect effect on the biggest bor-
rowing expense for most people, 

Phillip E. Harlow, the Andersen 
partner who was in charge of 
auditing Sunbeam. 

The SEC is seeking to bar 
Dunlap and his colleagues from 
serving as officers and directors of 
pUblicly traded companies and fin-
ing them an unspecified amount. 

The company took a huge 
write-off in 1996 as it closed 
plants and fired employees, but its 
reported profits soared in 1997, 
persuading many analysts that 
Dunlap had turned the company 
around. 

But the recovery was a myth, 
the SEC said. 

The SEC said that Dunlap and 
Russell A. Kersh, then Sunbeam's 
chief financial officer and a long-
time close associate of Dunlap, 
used numerous techniques to 
inflate earnings. 

The SEC said that some of the 
suspect transactions were uncov-
ered by Harlow, the Andersen 
panner, who asked the company 
to change its fin ancial statements. 
But the company's management 

their mongages. 
Tuesday's decision came 

against the backdrop of an econo-
my that appeared to have dipped 
into a zone of tepid growth just 
short of a recession. 

Retail sales rose in April , and 
consumer confidence stabilized, . 
but the econo_my lost 223,000 
jobs in April, the biggest down-
turn in more than a decade, and 
the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 
percent from 4.3 percent. 
Industrial production fell again 
last month. 

And most worrying to many 
analysts, businesses continued to 
reduce their investment spend-
ing plans. In doing so, they 
dragged down a segment of the 
economy that had been a leading 
engine of growth. 

Some economists said the Fed 
had reached a point where it 
needed to let its interest rate med-
icine do its work before adminis-
tering another dose. 

- Richard W. Stevenson 
The Nw York TImes 

refused to make most of the 
requested changes, and the audi-
tors agreed to certify the financial 
statements anyway, the SEC said. 
A lawyer for Harlow, the Andersen 
partner, said his client had acted 
properly and expected to be 
cleared. 

Sunbeam's new chief execu-
tive, Jerry w. Levin, failed to turn 
the company around, and in 
February it filed_ for bankruptcy 
protection. 

Sunbeam's shares still trade, 
however, and closed Tuesday at 
7.3 cents, down a tenth of a cent, 
in over-the-counter trading. They 
will be worthless if the bankrupt-
cy plan is approved. 

After Dunlap was fired, Arthur 
Andersen, along with another 
accounting firm, audited the books 
again and concluded the 1997 
profits should have been far lower. 
The Andersen spokesman said the 
firm stands by that second audit.

San Diego S~ate University's Mascot Gets a New Title 
SDSU president decided Tuesday that the mascot wil l not change, but wi ll become more dignified 
By JESSICA ZlSKO 
Daily Aztec 

"Monty" Montezuma is no 
longer the San Diego State 
University mascot, President 
Stephen Weber announced 
Tuesday. Instead, he will take on a 
new role as campus "ambassador" 
- a more dignified portrayal of the 
Aztec leader. 

For now, there are no plans to 
find a new mascot. Rather, the uni-
versity will give Montezuma a new 
role as a figure Weber hopes will be 
used more for education and cul-
tural awareness and less for cheer-
leading at football games. He will 
still attend games, however. 

"This isn't going to look like the 
old one," he said. "It's not going to 
act like the old one. It's going to 
have different responsibilities than 
the old one had. This is not simply 
shifting the name - it's shifting 
what it is." 

All references to "Monty" will 
be ousted from the university and 

_only the full name Montezuma will 
be used, he said. In addition, uni-
versity logos that depict a red-faced 
Aztec will be removed, replaced by 
a new one designed with the guid-
ance of Aztec scholars. 

Weber's decision is the culmi-
nation of an eight-month local and 
national debate ignited by the 
Native American Student Alliance 
in November over the campus ' use 
of Aztec images. 

His decision also comes one 
month after the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights call,d for an end to 
the use of Native America n mas-

cots for spons teams and universi-
ties. 

Weber said Aztec culture is dif-
ferent than the cultures the com-
mission referred to because it 
ended 250 years before the United 
States was founded . The U.S. 
report, he said, mainly deals with 
more contemporary cultures. 

Members of the $tudent groups 
who protest the university'S usc of 
Aztec images say they are not satis-
fied with the final decision. 

"It's just a complete slap," said 
NASA's president Manny Lieras. 
"It's like them saying 'You guys put 
up a good fight, but you 're too 
small and too few to be given any 
consideration.''' 

NASA has about 20 members. 
At the press conference 

Tuesday, members of Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan held 
signs protesting the use of human 
mascots. • 

"We have nothing against the 
connection between the Aztec cul-
ture and the university, but when it 
is done in a way that disrespects 
our culture and silences our voice, 
it is something we are totally 
against ," said MEChA member 
Ron Gochez. • 

Weber said he does not expect 
everyone will be happy with .his 
decision, but asserted that the uni-
versity handled the matter appro-
priately. 

"I don't expect them to change 
their minds because I've made this 
decision," he said. "And I expect 
that they will continue to express 
thei r contrary view. But, I don't 
th ink anyone can argue that the 

university hasn't taken it seriously, 
studied it carefully." 

For the past five months, a task 
force analyzed the un iversi ty'S 
depiction of Montezuma. The 
group was comprised of 20 
appointed members and submitted 
its recommendations to Weber on 
May 2. The task force 's sub·.nission 
included a proposal to make 
Montezuma an ambassador instead 

"We have nothing 
against the connection 
between the Aztec 
culture and the 
university, but when it 
is done in a way that 
disrespects our culture 
and silences our voice, it 
is something we are 
totally against."

MEChA member 

The process of eradicating 
"Monty" references will affect 
Monty's Pub in Aztec Center and -
four Monty's Markets. This, along 
with the elimination of logos, is 
expected to cost the un iver~i ty 
thousands of dollars. 

Weber expects the changes to 
be completed by 2003. The univer-
sity and any auxil iary organization 

affected by his decision will be 
responsible for funding the 
changes. However, the campus is 
up against a $2.9 mill ion deficit 
next year brought on by high nat-
ural gas prices, and Weber said he 
antic ipates tight resources. 

"There's a lot of work to do and 
we don't have a lot of money to get 
it done, so it must be done in a fis-
ca lly responsible way over time," he 
said. "We're goin~ to do all of these 
things, but we're all faci ng a very 
tough budget." 

Louie Holton. . owner of 
Monty's Pub, said he has no idea 
what name he 's going to give his 
business now. 

"I haven't really thought about 
it," he said. "I'll probably change it 
to my own name. That way I won't 
make anybody mad." 

The bar on campus has been 
called Monty's Pu b since the early 
1990s. When Holton took over the 
establishment in 1999, he said he 
was asked to retain the name. 

The on ly "Mon ty" reference 
that wi ll stay on campus is the 
Alumni Associ:n ion's Monty 
Awards, given to outstanding 
alumni, faculty and staff each year. 
The Monty, which is based upon 
SDSU's 1936 DOhal Hord sculp-
ture, wi ll continue to be used by 
the association to represent the 
prestigious award, Weber said . 

Alumni Association Director 
Jim Herrick said the group supports 
Monty's promotion, even though 
most alumni hoped the figure 
would remain the campus mascot. 

"We don't have the mascot any-
more - that's very painful to most 

Get the Guardian online www.ucsdguardian.org 

alumni," Herrick sa id . 
"Nonetheless, we do still have 
Montezuma and we're going to 
give that role as an ambassador 
more dignity." 

For now, Aztec Shops will I:On-
til1lle tq,sell products and the foot-
ball team will continue wearing 
uniforms bearing the red-facl'd 
logo. New shipments with the 
image will not be ordered. 

Montezuma will also still make 
appearances at football games. but 
not in the spear-throwing manner 
he has assumed in the past. In stead 
he wi ll be depicted wi th morl' 
respect and historical accuracy. 

"We have cheerleaders on the 
field ," Weber said . "We're looklllg 
at the role of Montezuma and hc 's 
not going to be a cheerleader." 

Last fa ll , the A.S. Council voted 
to recommend dropping the m,IS-
cot and nickname "Aztecs." 
Students then voted in a nonbind-
ing ca mpus re ferendum that 
showed overwhelm ing Slipport for 
keeping the mascot and nickname. 
The Alumni Association and the 
University Senate also approwd 
similar resolutions. 

In November, Weber 
announced that the campus wou ld 
keep its affil iation with the Aztec. 
but formed the task force to look 
into how similar images are used. 

Despite Weber's fin al decision 
on the matter, an action is still 
pending with the U.S. Depa nnmlt 
of Education Office fo r Civil 
Rights. It was filed in February by .1 
NASA member, but other ml'lIl-
bers say th ~ group will not pursue 
any further action.

U. Chicago AppoInts 
Levmore as Dean 
of Law School 

CHICAGO - University pres-
ident Don Michael Randel has 
named Saul Levmore the new 
dean of the University of Chicago 
Law School. Levmore was recom-
mended to Randel by a committee 
headed by Karl . Llewellyn 
Distinguished Service Professor of 
Law, Cass Sunstein. 

''I'm exci ted and not apprehen-
sive, but energetic," Levmore said 
in rega rd to tak~g over for 
Interim Dean Richard Epstein , 
who has served since Daniel R. 
Fishel resigned. in February. 

"The exceptional academic 
standards of the University of 
Chicago Law School demand a 
dean of great academic distinc-
tion, as well as one who can work 
effectively with the School's 
many constituencies," Randel 
said in a statement. "[n Saul 
Levmore we are fortunate to 
have found just such a dean . [ 
look forward to working with 
him to ensure that the school 
continues to define the highest 
sta ndards in the study and teach-
ing of the law." 

Levmore himself sees Chicago 
Law's academic focus as an asset 
that can be applied and expanded. 
"['d like to try to apply some of 
our great theory and great stu-
dents and faculty to national and 
international problems: Levmore 
said. "The Law School is known 
for its great theory and great intel-
lectua l intensity. I'd like to bring in 
vi si ting scholars and apply the 
theory to issues like health care 
and voting reform." 

Levmore is the school's current 
William B. Graham Professor of 
Law after having served as a visiting 
professor at Yale, Harvard, Toronto, 
Michigan , and Northwestern 

The UCSD Guardian 

Universities. He was also the 
Brokaw Professor and the Albert 
Clark Tate Jr. Research Professor at 
the University of Virginia. 

"[ feel a bit like a newcomer 
and a little bit like an insider," 
Levmore said. "In a way, [ come 
with p.·rspectives about the Law 
School but also ideas about things 
we could tly." 

Sunstein's committee con-
ducted an international search for 
a new dean before deciding on 
Levmore, a member of the faculty 
since 1998. 

"We wanted someone who was 
intellectually outstanding, really 
first rate as an academic," 
Sunstein said. "We wanted some-
one who would be able to \ ork 
well with students, who had a 
good reputation as a teacher, who 
would be able to deal well with a 
wide range of people, and who 
had a good sense of humor." 

Levmore was a clear choice for 
Sunstein. 

"He's been widely thought of 
for many years as a terrific dean 
prospect," Sunstein said. "He's an 
unbelievably accomplished 
teacher, one of the best teachers in 
the country, and also a truly out-
standing mentor to students. He 
has such a tremendous amount of 
energy." 

[n making a final choice, 
Randel looked favorably upon 
Levmore's range of experience. 

"The president considers it an 
adva ntage that he's been on the 
faculty and knows the place well, 
but he has been at other institu-
tions so he has an outside per-
spective on us," Sunstein said. 
"He's someone who respects our 
traditions, but he's full of ideas." 

Levmore discussed his plans to 
. develop the Law School's current 
strengths while branching out to 
new areas.

Repeal: 
UC Academic Senate will 
make new criteria 
CcJnUnued from .... 3 
to move away from quantitative 
formulas: Davis said. "The 
changes to the admissions poli-
cies are to be implemented such 
that the fall 2002 class wou ld be 
reviewed subject to those poli-
cies." 

Locally, the pressure has been 
on the regents to repeal the two 
policies. Students protested their 
implementation last March in the 
Price Center Plaza with the " 52-
33-28" rally. Reaction to the 
repeal has been mostly positive. 

"This victory for students sets 
a pathway for concrete admis-
sions policy reforms of the 
future: said A.S. President Jeff 
Dodge. "Addressing issues rele-
vant to a lack of diversity at 
UCSD, the repeal of SP-1 and SP-
2 opens aven ues of discussion 
and ideas to actually create 
change ~n our campus." 

A.S. Vice President External 
Dylan deKervor noted that she 
felt 'the repeal would be effective 
despite California law outlawing 

- the consideration race or sex in 
hiring and adm issions. 

"Even though Prop. 209 is still 
in place, the act of rescinding SP-
1 and SP-2 is a huge act of good-
will toward the under-represented 
students on our campus, and it's 
paving the way for future 
progress," deKervor said. 

Vince Vasquez, chairman of 
the Conservative Union at UCSD, 
said the decision sends a mixed 
message si nce it goes agaill5t 
Proposition 209, which was 
passed by a majority of California 
vo ters. 

" It was obviously symbolic 
politics: he said . "[ was disap-
pointed but I know it means a lot 
to a lot of people. I respect the 
decision but [don't agree with it."

KDST: 
SRTV is more accessible to 
students than KSDT 
ContInued from INC- 1 
Works, which is in its last year of 
existence, received a budget of six 
stipends. He said the budget sepa-
ration is about clarifying who gets 
which stipends. 

According to Dodge, SRTV is 
the more accessible organization to 
students of the two, because KSDT 
is cable radio and does not have 
FM or AM bandwidth. 

"There has to be a time where 
KSDT has to pull it together: 
said Dodge, who believes that the 
split will make both services more 
accessible for students. "We're not 
go ing to increase funding for 
something that students can't 
use." 

KSDT DJs will be on Library 
Walk tomorrow as part of Sun 
God festivities. They will be hand-
ing out CDs, and there will be a 
sign-up sheet for students inter-
ested in getting involved wi th the 
station. 

On May 26 at 7 p.m. at the 
Hump, KSDT will present the 
band Estradasphere. The event will 
also highlight a vegan barbecue 
and wet T-shirt contest.

Alpha Epsilon Pi and Delta 
Gamma Win Chapter of the Year 

Alpha Epsilon PI and Delta 
Gamma were named Chapters 
of the Year recently when Inter-
fraternity Council and 
Panhellenic announced the 
Greek Award wi nners. Alpha 
Epsilon Pi came out ahead by 
pIcking up fou r awards. In ad-
di tion to winning chapter of the 
year the fraternity also won the 
awards for Scholarship and Risk 
Management. AEPi 's President 
Lance Miller also picked up an 
awa rd for Jun ior Emergin g 
Leader. 

Miller responded toAEPi 's 
success by saying that "We are 
very proud of the awards that 
AEPi received this year. There 
is a d ifference between an 
award and a reward however. 
The awards from this year ' 
Greek Awards might have been 
the trophie that our chapter 
took home, but the rewards 
came from the warm reception 
that the rest of the Greek Com-
mun ity showed us. I think that 
one of the reasons why we ap-
preciated the Chapter of the 
Year award above all was that 
it seemed we got there through 
respect and cooperation with all 
IFC/Panhellenic chapters at 
UCS D, an achievement to be 
recognized as one of combined 
effort by the entire community." 

Sigma Nu presented 
its fi rst annual Miss UCSD 
talent show and pageant on 
April 26'h in the Price Center 
Ballrooms. The event fea-
tured 12 contestants from 
various student organizations 
and raised over S 1,000 for 
our benefactor. Sigma Nu 
would like to thank all the 
contestant and everyone 
who helped make the show 
a success. 

Our benefactor is a 
wonderful non profit organi-
zallon known as Camp Kula. 
"Camp Kula" IS a summer 
camp that runs fo r one week 
each summer in Angeles

Associated Students 

Derby Days a Success 
This year, the J 2th annual 

Derby Days concluded it 's 
week-long philanthropic mis-
·sion by hosting a cohesive tu-
torial and sports day at the 
Pruess school. The event, which 
ran throughout Saturday, 
boasted representatives from 
every Greek sorority on cam-
pus, and served to breech the 
gap between UCSD and its 
revolutionary, new neighbor. 

Derby Days, which is co-
ordinated by the Sigma Chi Fra-
ternity, is, primarily, an en-
deavor to raise money for non-
profit organizations; it has also 
proved that it as much fun as it 
is gratifying. Derby Days can be 
broken down into a series of 
events which utilizes a forum of 
playful competition as a major 
rallying point for the UCSD so-
rority system. 

There are five major events 
which are used to determine the 
three most active sororities; 
these activities are distinctive 
and judged on a point system. 
The activities range from a lip-
synch/dance contest, featuring 
Sigma Chi "coaches" and their 
respective sororities performing 
dances and drama skits, to a 24 
hour fund-raising endeavor in-
volving swings on Li~rary 
Walk. 

This year 's Derby Days 
offered a vibrant representation 
of what's come to be considered 
one of the biggest philanthro-

pies on campus. The two major 
contribut ing sororities of the 
week , Alpha Chi Omega and 
Kappa Delta Phi, were followed 
closely by Chi Omega and Delta 
Gamma and helped lend an exu-
berant energy to the festivities . 
raising an astonishing 4,000 
dollars for The Children 's 
Miracle Network. 

This year, Sigma Chi took 
strides to expand the role of 
Derby Days by participating in 
an all-day philanthropy at the 
Pruess School. One of the most 
notable events , the lip-synch 
contest, was held in Price Cen-
ter on Thursday night. While 
every sorority was able to pro-
duce stimulating, entertaining 
skits , it was the ladies of Kappa 
Delta Phi who were able to win 
through an innovative, fresh in-
terpretation of the popular sci-
ence fiction film, "The Matrix." 
The event was also highl ighted 
by a special appearance of 
Sigma Chi alumnus Ben 
Glibberman, who-performed a ' 
stand-up act at one point in the 
night. In the midst of the lip-
synch contest, sororities, aided 
by four to six Sigma Chi 
coaches, took turns manning a 
pair of swings on Library walk. 
One of the most enduring quali-
ties of Derby Days is that it pro-
motes friendship and unity 
within the Greek system while 
also making significant head-
way for a very worthy cause.

It's easy to make a child smile. 
A few words of encouragement, 
maybe a special reward for a spec.ial 
performance. Parents do it all 
the time, and so do teachers . 

Good teachers are the difference 
between a child who succeeds and one 
who stumbles. They are the ones who 
make math fun and science seem like 
an adventure into another world . 

TeachilJg is the profession that allows 
you to see the most gratifying, 
immediate and instantaneous reward 
of a job well done-- a child's smile. 

Make a child smile. 
Take the next step - teach! 

Make the difference 
of a lifetime. .

solid set, and those goofy Aqua-

Although we only got one Root out 
of five, Rahzel stepped tip quite 
nicely - but the one-hi t wonder 
Dishwalla failed to carry the festi-

So-Cal punk band Face to Face

their most recent albums, which 
feature thei r rendi tions of "What

East Coast hip-hop group brings back 

O.P.P. after a 1 O-year hiatus 
By MIKE BARKER 
Staff Writer 

A Decade Later ... 

Can you believe that it's been 
10 years since Naughty By Nature 
released "O.P.P.?" Back in 1991, 
the virtually unknown New Jersey 
trio, composed of Treach, Vinnie 
and Kaygee, exploded onto the rap 
scene, capturing the Grammy for 
best rap performance with 
"O.P.P." That song and "Ghetto 
Bastard," the top two singles off 
their self-titled album, vaulted 
them into instant stardom. 

Their follow-up album "19 
Naughty 1II," featured the anthem 
"Hip-Hop Hooray: which 
enhanced their popularity to 
immeasurable proportions. The 
song was played on MTV eight to 
10 times a day and is stitJ consid-
ered tigh t today. 

Naughty By Nature's third 
release, "Poverty's Paradise," again 
topped the charts, and also won 
another Grammy, this time for 
best rap album in 1995. "Craziest" 
and "Feel Me Flow· headlined the 
album, while "Hang Out And

depth and quality.

Evet)' spring, the major ques-
tion on evet)'body's mind is "Who's 
headlining Sun God?" In recent 
years, there have been many com-
plaints about the quality and popu-
larity of the bands that have played 
at Sun God and UCS D. 

Scott Mantell, A.S. co-festivals 
coordinator with Priya Mohan , 
emphasized the increasing difficul-
ties in booking bands these days. 

Artists are no longer willing to 
do one-night events such as Sun 
God; rather, they prefer to be 
booked on long tours. Many per-
formers consider it a hassle to fly 
out, bring their crew and perform 
for one night. Their fees have also 
increased; a good artist used to cost 
anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 
per performance, they now go for 
between $50,000 to $75,000. 

Safety is also another issue taken 
into account when determining 
bands. Mantell stressed the necessi-
ty for safety as a key issue. Since 
RIMAC Field does not have walls, 
fencing has to be brought in, adding 
to the cost of the festival. "The goal 
is to have fun , but it also needs to be 
a safe event," Mantell said. 

Compounded by the fact that 
RIMAC Arena is a smaller venue 
compared to San Diego's Cox 
Arena. Coors Amphitheater and 
the Sports Arena, bands typically 

of the profits. . 
These factors place A.S. pro-

gram ming in an uphill battle to 
hire famous bands. This year's Sun 
God Festival budget, the largest in 
Sun God history, is approximately 
$140,000, with $85 ,000 coming 
from A.S. The remaining portion 
comes from corporate sponsorship, 
ticket sales and miscellaneous rev-
enues. 

Not all of the $140,000 allocat-
ed to the fes tival goes toward the 
performances. Approxi mately 
$15,000 goes to daytime program-
ming, $20,000 for the lights and 
stage, $5,000 for the inflatable 
games, and $10,000 is used to 
cover security, leaving about one-
third of the enure budget for the 
nighttime bands. In terms of cash, 
A.S. programming has little to work 
with in order to get extremely 
famous and popul<lr bands. 

One complaint about the 
band-hiring process attacks the 
timing of Sun God Festival plan-
ning. Historica lly, it takes th rec-
and-a-ha lf months to plan the 
festival. The planning canno t 
begin too early since bands can-
not plan far ahead. "Bands don't 
know what they're doing early,

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Staff Writer 

Hailing from Victorville, Calif. 
(the armpit of the world), these So-
Cal punk rockers are veterans of 
the road. For the last 10 years they 
have consistently put out some of 
the best power-pop punk, and are 
respected by fans and critics alike. 

Along with many other bands 
coming out of the early '90s, Face 
to Face brings an edgy, but pop 
sound to punk that is all their own 
amid so many bands that sound 
seem to JUSt imitate one another. 

Face to Face's seven full -length 
albums the past decade has seen 
have reflected some change to 
their sound, but they remain true 
to their roots. Still mainly a punk 
band, they turned away from the 
path of more mainstream, suc-
cess-minded groups. 

Forming in 1991, Face to Face 
began as a three-piece of guitar, 
bass and drums. The coming years 
saw a series of line-up changes, 
with the addition of a second gui-

Local band hopes to find

ContInued from page 18 

'Ping Pong Mafia.'" 
Musically, Satish , who is the 

ba nd 's primat)' songwriter and a 
UCSD student (he's working on 
his Ph .D. in Biology), draws upon 
evet)'thing from Bob Dylan to 
punk to influence hi s music. 
"IThe music isl kind of a 50150 
mix between classic rock, some 
folk stuff and also, I guess, a smat-
tering of '80s punk stuff," Satish 
said. 

Out of that wide spectrum 
emerges a sound that is both a 
throwback to classic rock and a 
new sound entirely. Satish 
describes the group as an "all-
original rock ' n' roll band ... 
there's kind of a slight folky edge, 
a lot of it is pretty blues-based ... 
somewhere between country 
rock, blues, folk and just original 
rock ' n' roll." 

In the short time that it has 
been together, the band became 
good enough to win UCSD's battle 
of the bands, a feat that even sur-
prised Satish. 

"Even when it came to battle of 
the bands, I was like, 'Oh, I'm sure 
we're going to get blown out of the 
water:" he said. "I'm just psyched 
that somebody liked us and gave us 
a chance." 

Although Ping Pong Mafi.a 
would not mind becoming as suc-
cessful as the: bands for which 
they will be opening at Sun God, 
they play music because they love 
it. 

"I'd like to get to the point 
where I could really just comfort-
ab ly support myself, and have a 
steady flow of gigs, and maybe get 
on the radio: Satish said. 

With his band's spot at Friday's 
Sun God Festival , it looks like 
Satish and his band are well on his 
way.

community is our job. 

tarist. Along with a number of 
label switches, they now reside 
with their own label, Lucky Lady. 
This offers them the freedom to 
record the way they want to. 

Their most recen t release, 
"Standards and Practices," is a disc 
of covers. The album is a tribute to 
both their punk influences and to 
other "great bands." It features the 
standout cover of Social Distor-
tion's "The KKK Took My Baby 
Away." 

Face to Face relies more on the 
D.I.Y. attitude of the hardcore. The 
previous album of new material, 
"Reactionat)': had its track listing 
chosen by fans ' votes on 
MP3.com. 

Notably less recognizable than 
similar sounding bands like Blink-
182 or NOFX, Face to Face has 
kept a closer tie with the under-
ground . With no memorable 
MTV play and short nationwide 
radio play for the 1996 self-titled 
album, the main support has been 
their touring. The past five years

Face to Face also kicked off one of

It really is unsurprising that

XZimif 
West Coast rapper represents as this 

year's Sun God headliner 
By MIKE BARKER 
Staff Writer 

Rap fans th roughout the coun-
tl)' are unfortunately overwhelmed 
by an abundance of ~sts who 
either go "Hollywood." or worse, 
are too afraid to be unique. 

Ma ny rappers today are faced 
with a dilem ma: main tai n thei r 
integrity and stay underground or 
sell out and compromise their style 
in exchange fo r fame and fo rtune. 
Vel)' few rappers can keep it real 
while at the same time enjoying 
commercial success. Xzibit , the 
Sun God headliner, is that rare 
artist who has accomplished this 
di ffic ult task. 

Born in Detroit, Xzibit lived 
there until his mother passed away 
when he was 9 years old. When his 
father remarried, he moved to Ari-
zona wit h him. He remained in the 
Southwest unt il age 17, when he 
moved to Los Angeles. 

In L.A., Xzibi t hooked up wi th 
producer Broadway, who intro-
duced him to Tha Al ka holi ks. His 
impress ive appearances on the Liks 
album "Coast Il Coast" grabbed the 
attention of Loud Records execu-
tive Steve Rifk in, who in turn 
offered "X" a record deal.

Nature: 
Old-school group 
changes rap formula 
Continued from page 17 
tra in ing ground. 

Kaygee, Naughty by Nature's 
OJ, has branched out as well. He 
founded and ru ns Divine Mill 
Records and signed artists Zhane 
and ext. He also collaborated 
with Queen Latifah, Run DMC 
and Shabba Ranks on this label. 

After their four-year hiatus, 
NBN released "19Naughty9: 
Nature's Ful)'." on their new label, 
Arista. T his album is different from 
any of thei r previo us releases 
because it features many guests, 
including appearances by Master P, 
Big Pun and Mystikal. With a cou-
ple of exceptions, the group's three 
previous albums have concentrated 
on Treach and Vinnie. The new 
album changes that formula . With 
all their experience in the rap game, 
Naughty by Nature are not afraid 
to adjust that formula, and their 
1999 release reflects that attitude. 

Naughty By Nature is probably 
the most we ll-known of all the Sun 
God performers. They've put in 10 
years of work, and there seems to 
be no reason why they can't be

Xzibit: 
Keeping it real, even 
with rising popularity 
Continued from page 20 
other in the industl)', and is h i~ 
most valuable asset. With an 
orchestra and a catchy drum beat 
mixed together, "Paparazzi." is one 
of the most creative rap songs ever 
released. He calls out the fakers in 
the chorus: "It's a shame, niggas in 
the game only for the money and 
the fame." 

"The Foundation." is a song 
written to his son, warning him of 
the hardships of growing up. Pro-
duced by Muggs, who has pro-
duced for Cypress Hill , it features a 
mesmerizing loop of ghostly wails 
and a rhythmic piano beat, making 
it a classic. He also works with 
Mobb Deep in "Eyes May- Shine." 
and shows off his versatil ity by 
blending in seamlessly with the 
dominant East Coast group. 

Everybody wanted a piece of X 
on his 1998 sophomore album "40 
Dayz & 40 Nightz." Method Man, 
Ras Kass and Jayo Felony make 
guest appearances. 

"Chamber Music" is a bangin' 
hardcore track that samples its 
background from Ice Cube's 1992 
song "When Will They Shoot?" 
"Recycled Assassins" and "Handle 
Your Business" are two other 
standouts from the album. 

While known by some under-
ground rap fans, Xzibit didn't really 
blow up until 1998, when he 
teamed up with Snoop Dogg in 
"Bitch Please." Produced by Dr. 
Ore, it has to be one of the 
smoothest songs ever made. Snoop 
and X complement each other per-
fectly, and Nate Dogg finishes off 
the song in his usual amazing form. 

With newly found fame from 
"Bitch Please" and the Up [n 
Smoke Tour, Xzibit's third album 
"Restless" received plenty of hype. 

Released in 2000, his first single, 
titled "X: got instant air play across 
the counti)'. "Front 2 Back" is my 
personal favorite, and [ know a lot of 
people bought this album because [ 
hear people quoting "Alkaholik" 
here at UCSD. Students chant: 
"Call it what you wanna call it, I'm a 
fuckin ' alcoholic." 

[n a 5-year span Xzibit has 
emerged as one of the most promi-
nent West Coast rappers around. He 
has stayed true to his fans who sup-
ported him from the word go, and at 
the same time attracted a new audi-
ence that has just discovered him. 

The future looks vel)' bright for 
the "X to the Z:

Blazing sun ... Women and men moving to the rhythms of

Is it Rio? 

No, it's Sun God! 
I searched through the celeb'rating throngs of people for 
my lost comrades. Crowds poured through UCSD ... dancing, 
purveying booths with locals goods on display, and sharing 
food and drink with new friends . 

Baked by the sun with many hours sti" to go, there was 
only one thing to do ... find a restaurant on campus to 
rejuvenate myself so I could return to the Sun God 
festivities. What better way to find a quiet, relaxing 
moment than to duck into Sierra Summit, Canyon Vista , 
or Plaza Cafe ... just to name a few. 
And who knows ... maybe I'd find my lost friends there 
seeking the same thing -

Don't wake up feeling

continued from ...,. 28 
look in their eyes and a bottle upon 
their lips. 

The Sun God Festival brings 
about a certain change in everyone. 
People ditch their usual apatheti-
cally bemused demeanors in favor 
of a care-free, "I just don't give a 
damn" outlook. 

I remember looking around at 
one of these Sun 
God celebrations 
and remarking to a 
group of friends 
that it would be 
great fun just to be 
in a completely 
drunken stupor at 
school every day. 
And it has been , 
and continues to 
be. Really, there is 
no better way to get 
through a com-
pletely stupefying 
day of boring lec-
tures than by 
drinking seven or 
eight shots of 
scotch before head-
ing off to class. 

bring with it a plethora of fine 
adventures and opportunities for 
drunken mischief. Now is the time 
to prepare thyself for it. The whole 
sordid mess will be rife with 
moments of imbibery, so that is 
what your first order of business 
should be: Get a bottle - a large 
bottle, a huge bottle, a bottle so big 
that finishing it off will only result 
in severe pain and agony. Then 
drink it; yes, drink it. Now! 

Why, you ask? Why would I 
want to wake up on the most 
important day of the school year 
with a horrible hangover and a 

mouth that feels 
like your room-
mate slept with 
his or her feet in 
it? Because, silly, 
at that point you 
will have no 
choice but to go 
hair of the dog 
and get right back 
to the sauce.

Why would I want 
to wake up on the 
most important day 
of the school year 
with a horrible 
hangover and a 
mouth that feels 
like your roommate 
slept with his or 
her feet in it? 
Because, silly, at 
that point y.ou will 
have no choice but 
to go hair of the 
dog and get right 
back to the sauce. 

Unless you go 
all night (which is 
a very viable 
option), you will 
wake up feeling 
bad on the big 
day, but only for 
the most fleeting 
of moments. Once 
that sweet alcohol 
begins to flow 
through your 
veins, your body 
will remember 
that you are its 
friend and it will 
go back to feeling 

like a million bucks. offices, for instance) than by drink-
ing eight or so beers before, during 
and after the grueling experience.

But without the proper instruc-
tion, this sort of thing can easily go 
awry, so it is best to start with a day 
that will not be want for drunken 
companions with whom to blend 
in. Sun God is the call in this arena. 

Getting drunk is much easier 
when the only thing in your system 
is liquor, so after a Bloody Mary or 
two, you will be ready to rock! 

So put this paper down and get 
after that bottle. I'll see you at the 
concert, or in detox, or in one of 
those wonderful, marvelous 
moments in between. Sun God 2001 promises to

Saying Goodbye to Two Men's Soccer Stars 
Tritons Brady Bernard and Tyler Korman leave behind stellar careers and RIMAe Field 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Semor Staff Wnter 

The 'BA and NHL playoffs 
are winding down. Baseball is in 
full swing, while Tiger Woods 
remains unstoppable on the green 
terrain. Tennis is beginning its 
second grJlld slam. and football is 
commenclIlg Its minicamps. New 
blockbuster movies are hitting the 
screens. ThiS could only mark one 
thing ... school's almost over. 

As the days of sun and relax-
.Ilion are nearing for UCS D stu-
dents, for some, this is a bitter-
sweet end. 

Se niors Brady Bernard and 
Tykr Korman will graduate with 
the class of 2001 in june, and 
wherever thei r lives may lead 
them, they can always say they 
were members of the UCSD 
men's soccer team. They were 
Tritons in the trenches. 

Bernard starred as a mid fielder 
while belllg second on the team in 
shots and goals this season. For 
good measure. he was also first on 
the team in assists with five. He 
was second 111 total points behind 
junior Bobby Saadati . Korman was 
also a midfiddcr and player eight

games for the Tritons this season, 
tallying seven shots and one assist 
to round out his career. 

"Brady has been outstanding in 
all four years and was captain for 
two of them. He was an outstand-
ing forward who scored many 
game-winning goals" said Derek 
Armstrong, who has seen players 
come and go after 19 years as head 
coach. 

"Tyler has been a good squad 
member who works very hard to 
maintain his status on the team. 

His character and enthusiasm was 
important to team morale." 

In the 1998 season, Bernard and 
Korman were among the top point-
leaders on the team. During the 
1 999 season, Brady led the team in 
every statistical category, induding 
games played and total points. Kor-
man continued his steady pace, 
competing in six games for the 
team. That season the Tritons were 
12-4-3, losing to Trinity University 
of Texas in the NCAA Regionals. 

The team will surely miss the 

presence of these great players, yet 
incoming freshmen, along with 
six new seniors. should keep the 
Tritons in the hunt for the Divi-
sion II title next year. 

"Both were positive influences 
on the team," Armstrong said. 
"Both players were influential in 
developing the incoming players 
over the past few seasons, as well 
as making sure everything off the 
field was intact." 

Bernard hails from Santa Fe, 
Calif., while Korman comes from 
San jose. Korman will be off to 
the East Coast to pursue a career 
in biochemistry. while Bernard 
will stay down in Southern Cali-
fornia to work full time for a bio-
engineering company. 

These individuals have achieved 
both academic and athletic prowess 
during their time at UCSD. 

"I am sure that they have 
learned to deal with adversity 
somewhere in the last four years," 
Armstrong said. "I think they are 
equipped to cope with most things 
that life can throw at them." 

Armstrong ended with a few 
words of advice for his departing 
seniors: "Do something you enjoy, 
and do it well."

class. Unless you have a midterm, 
you are prohibited from attending. 
Second, everybody is drunk and 
upbeat the entire day. I often hear 
complaints about how this campus 
is impersonal and unfriendly. Well. 
I guarantee that you won't say that 
during Sun God. It is as if people 
who have been locked up in their 
rooms all year come out and try to 
make up for lost time. It is truly 
amazing. 

Also. the way that girls from 
SDSU are seemingly imported def-
initely helps. 

My plans are still up in the air. 
I don't kno~ whether I will sleep

toward "no." My roomm ates. 
friends and I will probably drink 
all weekend - and that includes 
Thursday night, which is an hon-
orary weekend night during Sun 
God week, or any week, as far as I 
am concerned. We will have to 
find a ride to campus, and then 
we will probably hang out in the 
beer garden most of the day, fol -
lowed by the concert, then a keg 
back at our place. Basically, I plan 
on turning my body into a brew-
ery and I hope that you will join 
me. 

Before I go, it is important for 
you to know that there is nothing 
else like this at UCSD, and it is 
more than worth blowing off 
responsibility for one day to act like 
a normal college student.

comeback of her own. Had these 
matches both gone the Tritons' 
way and had UCSD been able to 
pull OUt one of the other matches, 
they would have won . 

Despite the 10 s, the Tritons 
have nothing to be ashamed of. 
They finish the year with an 
impressive 16-6 record and fin-
ished second in tfle conference 
with a 7-1 record. 

LaPlante thought this may be a 
tough year because her team was 
so young, but she was wrong. 

"This season the team did bet-
ter then I ever thought we would 
in the very beginning," LaPlante 
said. "With so many freshman and 
the unknown of Division II , my 
goal was to finish in the top two in 
the conference. Going to nationals 
was only a dream." 

LaPlante went on to praise the 
work ethic and dedication of her 
players. 

"This team is a group of scrap-
py players who fought hard to get 
where they are; LaPlante said. 
"This can only help us build for 
next year." 

The prospects for next season 
indeed look bright. LaPlante will 
lose only one player of this year's 
squad and won't lose any starters. 
The Tritons should again be near 
the top of the conference and may 
be able to compete for the nation-
al championship that eluded them 
this season. -

UCSD Women's Tennis Trips Up at Division II Nationals 
Tritons end 2001 season in Florida after falling to Abeline Christian University 5-2 in the round of 16 
By BIU BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Coming off of an upset win over 
Hawaii Pacific University, the 
UCSD women's tennis team flew 
out to FIQrida last Thursday with 
only one thing on its mind: bring-
ing home its first NCAA Division II 
National Championship. 

The team had grown accus-
tomed to being in this position in 
Division Ill, where they perennially 
challenged for the national title, 
but this was its first run in Division 
II. 

. Unfortunately, the Tritons were 
quickly shown that they are not 
quite yet ready to grab the Division 
II title. They were el iminated in the 
first round of the tournament by 
Abilene Christian University 
(Texas) by a score of 5-2. 

The low ranking of Abilene 
Christian that was reported in the 
Guardian last week waS' actually a 
result of Abilene's coach not hand-
ing in documents in time. 
_ The team actually was ranked 
somewhere in the middle of the top 
10, making it one of the toughest 
opponents the Tritons faced all 
year. . 

Abilene was strong in doubles, 
taking two of the three prosets 
from the Tri tons. 

johnson and Kristin Chumley, 8-3. 
No. 3 doubles was a barn-burn-

er in the truest sense of the word. 
Ashley O'Neil and Mary Hung 
were down big early in the match 
but put it together when they need-
ed to. 

"They were down 5-2, and with 
a slight change in strategy, came 
back and won in a very exciting tie 
breaker," head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. uThis gave us some added 
confidence going into the singles." 

The score of the tiebreaker was 
7-5 in favor of the Tritons. 

The singles competition, how-
ever, was not kind to the Tritons . 
O'Neil took the court as the Tri-
tons' No. 1 player, as she did for 
most of the year, and was very com-
petitive with the best player that 
Abilene had to offer. After losing 
the first set 6-4, O'Neil was up 4-1 
in the second but faltered under 
the extreme aggression of her 
opponent, who won the next five 
games to take the second set 6-4. 

Tadlock quickly lost the first set 
at No.2 singles 6-1 , but found her 
composure in the second and was 
able to compete more closely. 
Unfortunately, she eventually did 
fall 6-4 in that set to lose the 
match . 

Lyndsey Tadlock, who had been 
chronically injured throughout the 
late part of the season, and 
Stephanie Moriarty teamed up at 
No. 1 doubles, as they had for most 
of the season. Their opponents, 
Leah Treer and Andrea Wildner, 
were too tough and took the set 8-
5. 

julie Westerman was completely 
overpowered at No. 5, something 
that rarely happened to her during 
the season. Her opponent found 
her stride early and continued to 
keep the pressure on. Westerman 
was the firs t Triton off the court 
with a 1-6, 1-6 loss. 

Oavid Plizi GuardIan 
Ball ny: The Tritons look furward to next year with a large conh'ngent of playm returning from this year's playoff squad. 

The match at No.2 doubles was 
not that close. Me1isa Liao and Julie 
Westerman quickly lost to Lacy 

Mary Hung continued her stel-
lar play with a win at NO. 6 singles. 
Not only did Hung win , she did so 
in easy fashion, handing her oppo-
nent, Velvet Canada, a crushing 6-
2, 6-0 defeat. 

UMary deserves a lot of credit 
for winning against [Hawaii Pacific 
University] and Abilene Christian 
very easily," LaPlante said. "She is 
really playing well ." 

This victory came after Hung 
was forced to fly out to Florida sep-

arately because a professor would-
n't let her out of a midterm that 
was scheduled after the team 
planned to leave for nationals. 

Melisa Liao and Kristina Jansen 
played at No. 3 and NO. 4 for the 
1ritons but did not finish their 

matches because the overall match 
was over before they could do so. 

Liao was looking strong after 
winning the second set of her 
match 6-0 to send her match to a

Women finish fourth, Nielson and Ewanio 
lead the men at conferenc~ championships 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and 
women 's track and field teams 
headed to the California Colle-
giate Athletic Association Cham-
pionships last weekend. 

The women finished fourth 
out of 1 0 schools with 79.5 points. 
The top women 's team overall was 
UC Davis with 228 points. 

"I did not think we were going 
to do this well," said track head 
coach Tony Salerno. "We had 
almost everyone step up: 

The men's squad did not fare 
quite as well with a fifth-place fin-

ish out of eight schools, ea rning 
54.6 points. The top men's school 
was Davis, with 247.5 points. 

"It was a good showing," Saler-
110 said. "It 's a rough conference." 

The women had a number of 
highlights. 

The top competitor was Lynne 
Brinkman, who finished second in 
the javelin throw with a tuss of 
37.76 meters. 

Meghan Scon also made some 
waves with a time of 11 :24.14 in the 
3000-meter steeplechase for third. 

UCSD's Clara Wilson finished 
fourth in the 400-meter hurdles 
with 64.79. Triton star Audrey Sung 
also had a strong showing, running 

the 1500 meters in 4:40.41. 
The men's side saw its star, 

James Nielson, shine brightly. He 
ran the 5000 meters in 14:21.15 
for first place. 

Also strutti ng his stuff was 
John Wong, who placed second in 
the 1500 meters with a 3:50 .86. 

Next up for the Tritons are the 
NCAA Division 11 ationals next 
weekend at Edwardsville, III. 

Six Tritons have qualified for 
the trip. They are Ewanio in the

vault, Wong in the 1500 meters, 
Sung in the 3000 meters and 
Scott in the steeplechase.

Crew Picks up Six . 
Triton women medal in six of nine 
events at Pacific Coast Championships 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

In its last event of the regular 
season, the UCSD women 's rowing 
team came up big Sunday in the 
Pacific Coast Rowing Cha mpi-
onships, winning six medals in the 
nine-event competition. 

Plagued by difficult wind condi-
tions and bad luck, the Triton boats 
still managed to take three silvers 
and three bronzes home. 

The Triton lightweight boats, 
ranked seventh in the U.S. Rowing 
Collegiate Poll, started off poorly; the 
lightweight four was delayed off the 
stan line by equipment problems. 

Tritons Heath Beckman, Emily 
Gray, Cari Blemker, Julie Snyder 
and coxswain Liz Edmunson gave 
rival Humboldt State University a 
full boat-length lead. The Tritons 
then played ca tch-up the rest of the 
match and fell just short of beating 
the Lumbe~acks in a photo finish. 

"The crew showed tremendous 
poise to recover and row through 
the field to get to Humboldt," 
coach Pattie Pinkerton said. 

Following its teammates' exam-
ple, the lightweight eight team of 
coxswain Kiley Santana, Beckman, 
Gray, Blemker, Snyder, Jaime 
Cooper, Molly James, Claire Doyle 
and Rebe ca Rodriquez caught 
some bad wind and was two boat-
lengths behind its closest competi-
tor when it finally regained its bear-
ings. Despite the adversity, the crew 
rowed into third place, behind 
Humboldt State and UCLA. 

"It was disappointing, but the 
crew responded with courage and 
determination and felt they put 
everything they had into it," 
Pinkerton said. 
. The UCSD varsity boats had a 

bit of better luck, as the varsity four 

of coxswain Dylan deKervor, 
Tiffany Cady, Jillian Drewes, 
Sharon Bergquist and Nicole 
Matouk beat out Humboldt State 
for third place, .Iosing only to 
SDSU and Willamette University. 

However, the varsity eight with 
deKervor, Bergquist, Drewes, Cady, 
Matouk, Sara Patton, Jessica Jocius, 
Lindsay Hall and Morgan Dawirs 
could only come up with a fourth-
place finish after losing third place ill 
a close race to Willamette UnivrtSity. 

"We would have liked to medal 
in both races, but with a very young 
varsity, it was a spe'ctacular perfor-
mance," Pinkerton said. "We get 
better every race and it hurt us that 
we had three races canceled due to 
weather in our lead-up." 

The UCSD novice boats had an 
especially good day, winning two 
silver and one bronze medal. 

. The novice four won its qualifY-
ing heat, but came up short agai nst 
SDSU in the final after the Aztec 
boat came from behind to stun the 
Tritons. 

The novice eight used a latc 
charge to finish neck-and-neck with 
Saint Mary's and UCLA in ·a photo 
finish. UCSD received second place 
and Saint Mary's was judged to have 
finished third. The novice light-
weight eight brought home a bronze 
medal and the novice lightweight 
four and second novice eight both 
finished fourth in their races. 

Pinkerton was satisfied with the 
ove:'all results. 

"We have certainly made our 
presence fe lt, and look forward to 
next year," she said. 

While Sunday marked the end of 
the regular season, the Tritons aren't 
quite finished yet as they have their 
eyes on the NCAA Rowing Cham-
pionships on May 25 through May 
27 at Lake Lanier, Ga.

SCOTT BURROUGHS 

T here lies only a day between you, the dazed young Triton with the 
Guardian clutched greedily in 
your grimy little paws, and the 
single greatest day of the school 
year. 

For 32 weeks and six days a 
year, this campus is a desolate, 
withered, soul-sucking waste of 
landscape; a tepid zone of brain-
deadening tedium, bereft of any 
semblance of joy or smidgen of 
liveliness. But for one glorious 
afternoon each spring, this dor-
mant hole undergoes a fantasti-
cal transformation, as study 
lounge dorks emerge from 
Geisel, blinking their dilated 
pupils in the harsh glare ema-
nating from the foreign object 
high in the sky and, yes, breaking 
a smile. 

This process is not at all 
unlike the beautiful butterfly 
emerging from its boring 
cocoon, and much as the butter-
fly heads straight to the nearest 
flower to suckle on its sweet 
nectar, the bookworms heads 
straight to the nearest tap to 
guzzle its fine brews. 

Incidentally, it's not just the 
library locals that shed the 
shackles of shame that cause 
their encumbrance day in and 
day out, but everyone on the 
whole bloody campus. 

Hippies, grad students, Greek 
geeks, jocks, ' stoners, lobsters, 
student council kids, artists, dis-
illusioned hobos, slougers, 
newspaper nerds, ravers, goths, 
punk rockers, Neil Dennis, 
tweekers, skaters, that guy from 
your physics section, that girl 
that lived by you in the dorms, 
the chick from that one party at 
that one dude's house and all 
other assorted riffraff, all cheer-
fully gallivanting abou t the 
UCSD campus with a whimsical

used to love Christmas. I 
would not be able to 
sleep the night before 

due to anticipation, and when 
the day was over, I would be 
depressed for a week because it 
was gone for another year. 

As I got older, I thought that 
there was nothing that . would 
cause me to have that reaction 
again, nothing that I would look 
forward to so much that it would 
physically hurt when it was 
gone. 

Well boys and girls, Christ-

Sun God is tomorrow and, 
in case you couldn 't tell , I am

I will be up the 5 freeway at 
UCLA during the Friday of 
UCSD's seventh week of spring 

quarter, most likely with my 
nose buried in a law book, 
wondering how I became such 
a stiff in such a short period of 
time. 

But this year - this year is an 
entirely different story.
