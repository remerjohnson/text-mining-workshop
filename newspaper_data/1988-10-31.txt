date George Bush]." Reagan referred to the 
Democrats as "liberals" more than,a doz.en. times 
throughout the 20-minute speech. 

In hia last San Diego address as chief execu-
tive, President Reagan spoke scathingly of the 
Republican's "liberal" opposition at a rally held 
at the Sports Arena last Thursday. 

Reagan said that during the past eight years, 
the Republicans have turned around the wea-
kened economy left to them by the "malaise 
years" of the Carter administration. 

Seizing the "negative campaigning" issue that 
has been prevalent in the 1988 campaign, the 
President told his audience that he and "George 
Bush worked much too hard to cut your taxes to 
let our opponents come into office and raise 

The President, sharing the dais with Republi-
can congressional hopefuls, spoke briefly to 
thousands of cheering, flag waving supporters 
about the "Rcapn Revolution, to which he said 
baa broUJbt about a "thriving economy, a strong 
natioal dSente ' and the p(eSCrvation of the 
family."

"That revolution is going to continue come 
November ninth," President Reagan added. 

Reaga n also assessed his ad ministration's pol-
icy achievements and said that "none of our 
triumphs would have happened if the liberals 
had their way." Reagan cited the Grenada

Students Hear Town Council Complaints 
By KEN JENSEN 
GUlUdian Intern 

Complaints of a lack of com-
munication between the UCSD 
administration and surrounding 
communities were expressed at 
an informal meeting between the 
A.S. and representatives of San 
Diego community councils last 
Wednesday evening. 

The informal meeting, part of 
an on-going effort by A.S. Vice 
President of External Affairs 
Mordecai Potash to involve prom-
inent members of the San Diego 
community with UCSD students, 
included representatives from San 
Diego and La Jolla town councils 
as well as Del Mar Deputy Mayor 
Brooke Eisenberg and a represen-

tative from the San Diego Mayor's 
office. 

The purpose of the gathering 
was to give students a chance to 
"mingle with some of the coun-
cil," said Adam Torem, A .S. 
Municipal Lobby Director of Ex-
ternal Affairs. 

In an interview just prior to the 
meeting, Torem expressed the 
desire to see increased student 
involvement in surrounding com-
munities. 

Torem's interest is shared by 
Potash, who has shifted the orien-
tation of the V. P. External office 
to include a stronger emphasis on 
municipal relations with the A.S. 

La Jolla City Council member 
Robert Whilteman said he sees 
the relations between the campus 
and the community "improving."

State Propositions 

Despite improvements, though, 
Whitteman said the University 
forgets about the community it is 
in and needs to interact with it 
more. 

State and federal funding of the 
University of California, Whit-
ternan claimed, results in UCSD's 
lack of concern for local govern-
ing bodies. 

Whitteman said that heavy 
traffic and insufficient parking in 
La Jolla are problems to which 
UCSD contributes. 

Neighborhood parking, parti-
cularly on La Jolla Farms Road, 
is a problem La Jolla home owners 
attribute to UCSD, according to 
Whitlemen.

A .S. Battle Continues Over 
A Ileged Rights Violations 

8y LAURA PROCTOR 
Guardia" Inte", 

Perceived violations of student 
rights were the subject of an in-
tense debate at UCSD when two 
resolutions seeking to end the 
administration's alleged disregard 
for student input were proposed 
at last Wednesday's A.S. Council 
meeting. 

Neither measure passed, although 
the Council later approved a 
resolution expanding the rights of 
students who are accused of 
violating the Student Conduct 
Code. 

In addition, the Council dis-
cussed the denial of funds to the 
Koala based on recent complaints 
of racist humor in the campus 
paper. 

Announcements were also 
made regarding developments in 
the planning for this year's Sun 
God Festival, and the Grove 
Caffe's upcoming switch from 
styrofoam to paper cups. 

The two student rights resol-
utions, one by Student Advocate 
Bard-Alan Finlan, and one by 
Warren Sophomore Senator Tina 
Maher, were a result of the admin-
istration's recent amendment of a 
UCSD policy affecting students. 

Maher's resolution sought not 
to alter the administration's recent 
policy change which affected stud-
ent representation on a campus 
policymaking board , but to in-
crease future student represent-

ation. 
Finlan's proposal, which he first 

submitted at the Oct. 12 Council 
meeting (Guardian. Oct . 13) dem-
ands the retraction of the cont-
roversial amendment, as well as 
an increase in student represent-
ation. 

A.S. President Maynard Dim-
mesdale urged the Council to 
reject Maher's resolution in favor 
of Finlan's, saying that the prob-
lem had not been a lack of student 
input, but the administration 's 
disregard of it. 

"We have actual letters in-
dicating that our input was over-
looked. . . . Simply putting more 
people on the committe does not 
ensure that that will not happen 
again," Dimmesdale said. 

Maher argued that her resolu-
tion would effectively solve the 
problem by placing six people on 
the student advisory committee 
instead of the sin~le student rep-
resentative provided by the new 
administration policy. 

Finlan said this would be "put-
ting a bandaid on the problem," 
and said that failure to demand a 
retraction from the administration 
would be "allowing them to es-
sentially break the law." 

After f~i1ing to pass Maher's 
resolution by a vote of 5-1 r, the 
Council began consideration of 
Finlan's resolution. 

Not all council members were 
against Finlan's proposal to ask 
for a policy reversal. but several

I~ . UC NEWS 
UCSA Determines Top Issues 
that Concern Students this Year 

The top issues for students in the UC system this 
y.ear are health insurance, graduate student employee 

ngh~s , student control of student-funded build ings, 
quahty of undergraduate education, graduate student 
and faculty affirmative action, and the state's long 
term student fee policy. These issues were selected by 
the UCSA Board of Directors as the UCSA 1988-89 
Advocacy Program at its meet ing at UCLA Oct. 14-
16. UCSA also acted on the UC's proposed budget, 
employee benefits for student employees, and 
appointed a new· Executive Director. 

The actions of the UCSA Boa rd culminated a three 
month process of identifying student concerns and 
consulting with all nine campuses regarding priorities. 
The Advocacy program is a package of student initia-
tives on which UCSA will place high priority empha-
sis and which will receive the greatest allocation for 
the organization's resources. 

UCSA discussed the UC's difficult financial situa-
tion which arises from a reduction of state funding . 
While acknowledging the need for fiscal restraint , 
UCSA voted to ask the Regents, at their meet ing on 
Oct. 20 in San Francisco, to make clear to the state 
the need for improvements in T A training and affir-
mative action and to find funds to provide Research 
Assistant salary adjustments and student employee 
health insurance. 

The health insurance issue arises from the UC's 
pending implementation of a new employee benefit 
plan for pan time employees in order to comply with 
changes in the Federal Tax Code. The University of 
California is currently considering whether or not to 
include student employees. However, even if they do 
extend the coverage to student employees, current 
plans will provide no new fund ing and would require 
depanments to pay for these benefits themselves. The 
fear is that either student hours or wages will be cut to 
meet these costs. In addition, the proposed plan is 
extremely inadequate in terms of the coverage it 
would provide. UCSA has taken the position that

may fi!e ag~ins t student rapi t through their school' 
~dmlOlstratlOn separately to have their assailants pun-
Ished by the school. 

The California Assembly Co ncurrent Resolution 
Bill 46 was introduced by Asse mblyman Tom 
Hayden, D-Santa Monica, to give state universitites 
the power to have a rapist suspended or expelled from 
school if the crime occurred on campus or at a 
campus-related event. This law became effective last 
spring. 

Under s~ct ion 261 of the penal code, a person who 
has c~mmilted ~ape can be punished for up to eight 
years 10 state pnson, but a student does not necessar-
ily have to file criminal charges in order to file a com-
plaint with the campus office. 

There are no provisions that specify how severely 
an offender should be punished . For example, 
nothing in the law states how long a student would be 
suspended for raping another student.

U CSB Chancellor and Wife to Appeal 
Charges of Embezzlement 

SANTA BARBARA - Former UCSB Chancellor 
Robert H~tt~nback and his wife Freda will appeal 
their conVICllon of embezzlement of university funds 
~nd tax fra~d that w~re handed down in July, accord-
109 to a nOllce of appeal filed Monday, Oct. 17 in 
Santa Monica Supreme Coun. 

"That notice of appeal triggers the preparation of 
the transcripts of the trial," said appellate attorney 
Dennis Fischer of Santa Monica, who is handling the 
appeal for the Huttenbacks. He said that the office of 
the Attorney General is expected to represent the state 
in the proceedings. 

Fischer estimated that the case could take one or 
two years before its resolution. He also said that it is 
likely that the couple will still be required to observe 
Judge Zel Canter's Sept. 7 sentencing pronouncement 
that the two each serve five years probation and pay 
fines totaling $70,000 (both were spared jail terms). 
Dr. Huttenback must also perform 1,000 hours of 
community service by teaching functionally illiterate 
convicted criminals to read for a local literacy 
program. 

. The appeaJ nc:»tice is a document which indicates an 
mtent of appealing the case, but does not specify rea-
sons for its filing. Fischer stated that it could be 
months before he files documents outlining the 
defense's basis for the appeal. 

In the meanti'me, Huttenback will continue to draw 
his yearly $81,000 university salary.

as to students considering health care careers. By ~n.ngJng.to~e~her cours~- _

Democracy really brings out the best in us, don't 
you think? Look at all the good citizens who have 
dropped their usual business to hurl themselves head-
long and giddy into what the California Review calls 
our obligation to "stand up and be counted as an 
American. " 

The California ballot initiatives have brought out 
the lawyers, insurance and tobacco companies, doc-
tors, anti-gay moralists and other folks who have 
our best interests at heart in a real burst of patriotism. 
Kind of like a "thousand points of light," only less 
.. incere. 

ENDORSEMENTS 
We've broken the initiatives down into fourcatego-

ries: insurance acts, bond acts, legislative amend-
ments and citizen initiatives. Good luck. 
The Insurance Ads 

Here's your scorecard : 100 is for the lawyers. 101 is 
for the insurance companies. 103 is for Ralph Nader. 
104 is also for the insurance companies. 106 is insu-
rance companies against lawyers. 

All operate at cross-purposes. Noone knows which 
wiU do what in light of possible passage of other 
initiatives. The one that gets the most votes gets 
entirely enacted; the rest, if they pass, will be enacted 
in areas in which they do not conflict with the most 
popular initiative. 

We recommend supporting one of the five and 
voting "no" on all the others , It's the only way youU 
have any idea of the possible effect of your vote , 

We also recommend that you pick 103 for your 
"ycs"vote. 

It would cut auto insurance rates 20 percent across 
the board. The state insurance commission, which is 
in the pocket of the insurance industry, would be able 
to mitigate some of those . cuts - as many as SO 
percent, according to the committee chair. 

Think about that. What that is saying is that, at 
most, half of the insurance companies operating in 
the state would not have their profits badly affected 
by a 20 percent rate cut. That's probably erring on the 
side of caution, so the truth is that insurance compan-
ies can afford the rate cut. And even the companies 
will t~lI you that rates should come down. This initia-
tive would bring them down the most. 

The initiative also calls for statewide election of 
insurance commissioners. Some say that this will 
allbw the insurance companies to buy the positions, 
but they already do that through the gover-
nor's office. You can't exactly call Deukmejian's 
appointments friends of the s~all insuree. This at 
least gives consumers a shot at It. 
Citizen Initiatives 

The most visible of these initiatives is 99, the 
tobacco tax increase from 10 cents to ~5 cents per 
pack, placing California in the upper third or so of 
state tobacco taxes. The money would be used ~or 
health programs and to offset the eX'p~nse .of treatln~ 
cancer patients. We regret that the IDltlatlVe doesn t 
make the tax higher. 

96 and 102 are the AIDS initiatives. 96 allows for 

FEIFFER~ 

IF HICHA51- GWAkIS 
HAC? ~ A 
ffi1atOO" ? !itU ?' l \ 

forced testing of people who are suspected upon 
"probable cause" of a sex offense or assaulting a 
police, fire or medical official. The test results would 
not be confidential, because any parties involved 
would be notified of the results. 

Take the example of UCSD student Kristen Crab-
tree, who was accused of biting an FBI agent. She 
would have been given an AIDS test against her will 
and the results of the test released . She was later 
exonerated, but she wouldn't have been able to stop 
the test or keep the results from public dissemination. 

96 would also strain existing testing capacity. 
Facilities already have more than they can handle in 
completing voluntary tests. 

While the motivation for 96 is clear but misguided , 
102 is simply a sleazy attempt to capitalize on anti-
ga y sentiment. It would shatter the only proven 
method of gathering information about socially sen-
sitive, communicable diseases, i.e., confidential test-
ing. Anyone tested would have the positive results 
reported to the state . Like 96, it would require testing 
of those accused but not convicted of certain crimes. 

97 would restore OSHA, the Occupation Safety 
and Health Administration, to its proper place in 
Califonia protecting workers from unsafe and ha-
zardous working conditions. In this era of pain-
staking assembly-line work in Silicon Valley, pesti-
cide use in the growth offruits and vegetables and the 
unknown effect of new industries and types of work-
places, OSHA is essential. 

9S has a certain amount of poetic justice: it would 
increase inspection of building sites, at which people 

contained virtually nothing that would help under-
graduates), but 98 is really another way for state 
legislators and the governor to avoid building a legis-
lative and citizen consensus behind more funds for 
education. We have no recommendation. 

105, the disclosure initiative, will probably be 
legally invalidated because it covers more than one 
topic. 
Bond Acts 

We recommend a "yes" on 78, 79 and 85, which 
will help schools and libraries, and on 81, 82 and 83, 
which will help clean up and conserve the state's 
second most precious resource, water. We also 
recommend a "yes" on the Homeless Act. 

We recommend a ~no" on 80 and 86, which continue 
to emphasize discredited and useless punitive ap-
proaches to the criminal justice system. More prisons 
lead to more criminality because of hideously high 
rates of recidivism. 

Legislative Amendments 
These are mostly non-controversial, "good go-

vernment"-type housekeeping measures. We're in 
favor of all - 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93 and 94 - except 
one: 89, which would give the governor the right to 
cancel parole for certain offenders already approved 
by their parole board . More playing politics with 
people's lives is what will result. 

We've had that in the presidential campaign 
already - Bush playing politics with the furlough of 
Willie Horton. That kind of sleazy garbage has gone 
on more than long enough, thank you. 

will live and work, to help create a pool of money to ___________________ _ 
help those who have no place to live and work. 

98 is for education bucks, and it's backed big-time by 
the UC system. Ch~lDcellor Richard Atkinson pre-
pared a wish list - at the system-wide request - of 
all the neat things we could get if 98 passes (his list

Q and A: What are you going to be for Halloween and why? 

I'm going to be a senior 
desperately trying 10 leave 
this place. 

David WeDs 
Senior, Revelle 

Economics 

Look at the 
Real Issues 
Editor: 

It's time for people to stop 
complaining about the sexism and 
racism at UCSD and get on with 
their lives. I care too, but I have 
enough common sense to realize 
that it isn't going to change over-
night. The problem is a world-
wide one, and ~can'tturn UCSD 
into a utopia, free from sexism 
and racism, unless we plan to shut 
out the world. 

Consider my situation. I am a 
black, female , firs/-year student 
here at UCSD. I've been here for 
half of one quarter, and I am very 
confused. I don't know for sure 
what to call myself (I am a fresh-
somethingorother). I'm confused 
about whether or not to read the 
Koala (well, it was funny, but 
maybe I should feel offended). It's 
a miracle that I'm still sure about 
my own name. 

Well, here's what I think. If 
jreshman is sexist, and jreshper-
son is awkward, then call usfirst-

- year students, or new k ids, or gul-
lible idiots (that' one seems popular 
among those of you who have 
been here for a while), or any-
thing. It's not life threatening. 
Nobody is going to fall dead if we 
don't resolve this mess right now. 

As for the Koala, it's up to eve-
ryone to decide for themselves 
whether they want to read the 
Koala. If you know that each 
issue is going to upset you, then 
don't waste your time reading it. 
If you are curious about it, or if. 
you've never read it, then read it 
and decide for yourself whether 
or not you're offended. 

Someone is always going to 
find sexist or grammatical fault 
with any new term suggested for 
freshthings, and the Koala is 
always going to be rude and nasty 
to everyone (not just minorities). 
Therefore, I think that we should 
stop harping on these issues and 
focus our attentions on the more 
seriously important problems in 
the world today. 

Look around . Our planet is 
being threatened by acid rain, 
nuclear weapons, war. mass star-
va tion . and a fierce bailie for con-
Irol of a world thai we are des-
Iroying anyway. It's lime we sel 
our prioritie~ straight.

New Ways of Getting Sick 
By A.M . BEZZERIDES 
News Editor 

All Hallow's Eve. What a day. 
Do you remember when you were 
a kid how you looked forward for 
months to putting on that space 
suit or ballerina costume? 

And when the 31 st came. You 
went to school in your costume 
and marched around to all the 
other classrooms comparing out-
fits, stuffed yourself at the Hallo-
ween party. 

And then at home. after dinner. 
it seemed as though it would 
never get dark so you could grab 
your empty pillow case and cruise 
the neighborhood racing from 
door to door trying to see just 
how much sugar filled crap you 
could beg for by saying the old 
faithful "Trick-orTreat?" 

What a concept. Begging for 
the kind of sweet stuff that your 
parent s forbade all year long. Not 
a bad deal for kids. But then. inev-
itably. you ate most of a com-
pletely filled pillow case in the 
next three days and got vilely ill. 
Not too smart, huh? Well think 
about it. Halloween. Tonight. 
after dinner. we'l anticipate the 
dark - having looked forward to 

it for weeks . 
We've grown uP. however. 

Moved up in the world . Moved 
up from a spaceman and a baller-
ina to perhaps a pirate and a belly 
dancer. WC\/C turncd in the pil-
low case for a large mug. A large 
mug that we11 try to fill many 
times (at someone else's expense) 
at various paqies with all kinds of 
alcohol until inevitably, that 
same overindulging illness that 
we experienced so many years 
before gets us. Yes. from free 
candy to free booze come the 
same symptoms. 

Well , that's enough critiquing 
our cult ure. 

I guess there 's one more small 
thing I could mention. I'm no 
longer your dedicated News Edi-
tor. As of today I turn the tre-
mendous job over to three eager 
men (I always find it takes three 
men to do the work of one 
woman). Don't get me wrong. 
I've got great faith in these guys as 
News types . 

Why'd I quit? I am beginning 
to wonder that myself. I'm not 
too sure what 111 do without the 
Guardian taking up my every free 
and not-so-free moment. I don't 
know what 111 do without late 

The UCS D Guardian 

nights a nd deadlines. 
I'll miss living down in that old 

building buried in the eucalyptus 
grove and being so close for the 
Che Cafe a II-you-can-eats during 
frantic Wednesday Guardian pro-
duct ion nights. 

Maybe I 11 learn that life doesn't 
have to be stressed and left to th~t 
last minute and gosh . I'll have 
time to get organized . 

Perhaps it'll strike me that col-
lege is time to mess around and be 
carefree. Gee. on that note. you11 
just have to excuse me while I sew 
the tail on my black cat costume 
so I can overindulge in Halloween 
treats tonight and get myself a 
good hangover .. . 

A.S. 
Continued from pal~ 4 

Although the council failed to 
pass the resolution first week. it 
was clear to me they did so 
through ignorance. 

Unfortunately. after two weeks. 
the resolution still did not pass its 
second appearance before thecoun-
cit. Only one member. Charles 
Ostrofe. Warren Senior Senator, 
supponed the resolution both 
times. 

Alex Wong. Third Senior Sen-
ator, was concerned "the wording 
'retroactively reversing' is too 
harsh." After all. the Administra-
tion put considerable time and 
effon into revising the document. 
To call for a complete nullifica-
tion of all that work is certainly 
inconsiderate. 

Tina Maher. Warren Sopho-
more Senator. expressed yet a-
nother attitude. "I don't care." 
Her concern is restoring student 
representation and not to con-
front the adminstration. 

The Student Advocate and I 
have spent considerable time urg-
ing the administration to resist 
approval of the revision. We were 
totally disregarded on all front s. 

Now I find the A.S. Council 
doing the same ...

LAW AND SOCIETY 
Intenllsclpll.a" Minor/Program of Concentration/Area Study 

L aw and Society is an interdisciplinary program that emphasizes the co~pl~xity. and interrelat ionship of legal, social and ethical issues in 
their histOrical context. The Law and Society minor is available to all 

UCSD s: udents with a general interest in law as a soeial institution as well as to 
students considering law-related careers. The purpose of the program is to 
enhance students' critical analysis of social and ethical issues related to law and 
of the legal implications an'd ramifications of policy and decision-making in 
their fields. To insure an interdisciplinary learning experience. students must 
include in their program at least one course from each of the following "core" 
academic departments: History. Philosophy. Political Science and Sociology. 

B ecause each college has different general education requirements (rules for non-contiguous coursework and rules for overlapping 
upper division coursework). students should contact an academic 

advisor in their college to see how the Law and Society Program can best meet 
theircoUege's general education requirements. Students who complete the program 
but do not use it for a minor, program of concentration or area study as part of 
the general education requirements, may elect to have a speciaJ notation on their 
transcript certifying their completion of the coursework.

REJECTED: Bills Fail in Council IT PAYS TO 

SHOP FOR AUTO 
INSURANCE 

Continued from p8&e I 
individuals maintained that his 
resolution was too vague, and 
contained loopholes. 

Revell~ Senior Senator Layla 
Kashani said the resolution "lacks 
a lot," and urged the Council to 
"show strength, not weakness." 
by convening to draw up a more 
effective resolution, instead of 
simply passing Finlan's. 

Public Relations Commissioner 
Tom Rhee questioned whether 
proponents of Finlan's resolution 
were really concerned with the 
general principle, or were against 
the specific policy instituted. ~ It 
seems to me that this is a personal 
issue rather than a conflict of 
interest," Rhee said. 

The Council employed Par-
liamentary rules to postpone the 
resolution indefinitely (an action 
that is known as an indirec t 
rejection). 

Dimmesdale expressed concern 
that Council members either did 
_Jlot realize the implications of the 
policy change, or were too in-
timidated by the administration 
to seek a retraction. He main-
tained that the issue of student 
rights extended far beyond the 
UCSD campus. 

"The Chancellors of the ad-
ministrations of each campus are 
not considering student input 
... we need to send a message to 
the administration, system-wide as 

well as our own." he said . 
Referring specifically to Nick 

Aguilar. Director of St ud ent 
Support Se rvices. Dimmesdale 
said, " What I'm afraid of is that 
the Council is being pers uaded by 

5 ~ Ucltrt t :: 
R~ht5 

tVow~ 

an administrator who's known 
for having changed sent iments 
almost on a daily basis." Dim-
mesdale later noted that Maher had 
recently met with Aguilar. 

Another proposal by Finlan 
was decidedly less controversial. 
It sought to expand the rights of 
students accused of violating the 
Student Conduct Code, by limit-
ing the period allowed for filing of 
a complaint to within 60 days of 
any alleged violation. 

The measure a lso provides for 
a s tudent 's right to a publ ic 
hearing, which was previously 
subject to University approval. 

The propo al passed unan-
imously. 

The Council denied an under-
write of $375 (for the showing of 
the movie "Heavy Metal") to the 
Koala. ci ting recent complaints of 
racism against the paper.

Finlan pointed out that the 
Co uncil should only loan money 
to media that serve the students 
of UCSD, saying "When a ca m-
pus paper makes racial com-
ments ... it does not represent the

Maher also announced that this

Tom Rhee argued. however. 
that chargi ng admission would be 
unworkable si nce the performing 
bands would ask for a percentage. 

Maher responded that any ad-
mission profit would go stra ight 
to charity.

t;3ook Tells Collegiates How to Cash In 

Entrepreneur Capitalizes on Talents 
By ELEONOR CASTILLO 

'Staff Wriler 

I f you are under 30, low on cash and fulJ of great ideas, take note. 
Do you like the idea of making 

thousands of dollars a month? 
How about choosing the hours 
you work and being your own 
boss? 

If you can answer yes to any of 
th~ .questions, then you're ready 
to J Oin the three-quaner million 
student entrepreneurs across the 
nation who are running their own 
businesses. 
New Ale 

We are a "new age" governed 
by creativity, said student entre-
preneur and recent UCSD gradu-
aJe Van Hutchinson. 
, Student entrepreneurs are d rea-

mers whose ultimate goal is the 
satisfaction of transforming an 

idea into a viable product or ser-
vice. No , they are not your 
upcoming business tycoons. 

"We arc a special breed apart , 
we're more like mavericks. We 
want 10 sIan our own businesses, .. 
Hutchinson said. 

They are willing to risk it all. 
(The word entrepreneur is derived 
from the French root "entrepren-
dre," meaning '"to undertake; to 
take a great risk.") They are char-
acterized by enormous amounts 
of motivation and perseverance 
towards a personal goal they want 
to achieve. 
Ambition Inspires 

The attitudes of these entre-
preneurs do not fit in with today's 
capitalistic views. Money is no 
longer the sole driving force to 
begin a business . Instead, "ambi-
tion, challenge and the need to be 
independent" are the inspirations, 
Hutchinson explained . 

Hutchinson attributes the binh 
of the student entrepreneur move-
ment to four factors: 
• The present generation is more 

sophisticated and has more money 
than any other in recent Ameri-
can history. 
• Rising college costs are a strong 

incentive. 
• The communication revolution 

has opened the door for anyone 
to become an entrepreneur (i.e. 
computers). 
• Being an entrepreneur offers 

endless possibilities in today's 
competitive job market. 
Book Published 

In his recently published book, 
College Cash: How to Earn and 
Learn as a Student Entrepreneur. 
Hutchinson tells what it takes to 
transform an idea into a viable 
product of service. 

As of Oct. 20, 6800 copies of the 
book had been sold .

Cycling team coach Mike Robertson, right, poses at the driving competition Saturday with the 
third place winner, Tim Flannery. Students competed for an all expenses paid trip to Daytona 
BeaCh, Florida, for spring break where the finalists compete for $1 0,000 in scholarships and the 
use of a Dodge Daytona Shelby. Mark Matsumoto came in first with a time of 16,377 seconds. 

ThiS competition, the National Colleg iate Driving Championships, has been held nationwide for 
seven years and this year students from more than 80 major universities will part icipate. It is 
supported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Safety Council. 
The competition is open to full-time undergraduate students.

Included in the book are exam-

worked hard to transform it into 
a suCcessful operation. One inspir-

PEACE CORPS ,., 
STILLTHE TOUGHEST JOB YOU'LL EVER LOVE. ~ 

Not everyone is cut out to change 
the world. After aU, it takes educa-
tion, skills and a spare two years. 
Also a willingness to work. Hard. 
This year 3,750 Americans will join 
the Peace Corps to do just that. 
They'll do things like build roads, 
plant forests and crops, teach 
English, develop small businesses, 
train community health workers, 
or even coach basketball. However. 
what they'U be doing isn't half as 
important as the fact that they'll be 
changing a little piece of the world 
... for the better. 
And when they return, these 
3,750 Americans will find that 
experience doing hard work will 
have another benefit . It's exactly 
what their next employers are 
looking for. 
So, give the Peace Corps your next 
two years. And while you're out 
changing the world, you'll also be 
making a place in it for yourself .

"I believe in investing in educa-

Hutchinson explained. 

But what, do you ask, would be 
a money maker for aspiring 
entrepreneurs at UCSD? A stu-
dent run gas station or a student 
credit union at Price Center were 
two ideas thought up by H utchin-
son's friend Chris Moshe.

Continued from pale 20 

The Tritons 1988-89 swimming 
schedule contains a mix of Div-
ision I , II . and III schools. Al-
though the Tritons are Division 
III, they consistently outswim 
their counterparts and are forced 
to schedule meets against Div-
ision I and II schools in order to 
have strong competition. Coach 
Morgan pointed to the UNL V 
Rebel Classic (Jan. 27-29) as 
the big meet of the season, where 
the team will "try to make all our 
NCAA time standards. ft 

Unlike other spons such as 
basketball and football , the goal 
~spire~ t.o in collegiate swimming 
IS quaJifymg for the National Cham-
pionships. • 

Sharing the Canyonview pool 
on Saturday was UCSD's diving 
team.. Seven Triton divers held a 
team competition of their own to 
p~ch themselves up for the new 
season. Staning at the three meter 
board , eaeh diver performed six 
different dives and was scored by 
three judges. Later, the action 
shifted to the one meter board, 
where the divers were scored on 
six additional dives. Don Osgood 
and Cathi Wood finished on top, 
with respective scores of 198. 19 
and 183.41. 

UCSD's diving team and new 
head coach, Tom Scotty, are 
looking forward to a tremendous 
season . . 

The Triton swimmers and div-
ers will take to the water again on 
Saturday, Nov . 12 , at II

Cross Country 
Passes Competition 
in San Bernardino 

I n what could be called a record-
breaking meet , the UCSD men's 
and women's cross-country teams 
both finished atop the competi-
tion in Saturday 's Cal State San 
Bernardino Invitational. Both 
Merrell Hora and Den ise 
McFayden broke the course 
record as they led the Tritons to 
Vi ctory ove r C al Lutheran 
and CS(JSB. 

In the 5.2 mile race for the men, 
Hora (27:01) held off Cal Lulohe-
ran 's Pat Byrne by 22 seconds, 
breaking the old course record of 
28: 14. In fact, three other Tritons 
(Roger Webb, Tom Zois, and 
Steven Fenster) all either tied or 
broke the school record, as the 
UCSD team defeated Cal Luthe-
ran by 10 overall points and clob-
bered CSUSB by 47 points. 

On the women's side, sopho-
more McFayden smoked by the 
rest of the field in 18:29, destroy-
ing the course record of 19:.50. Iris 
Gonzales placed third in 20:0 I for 
the Sk run. The women's team 
defeated Cal State San Bernar-
dino 29 to 22. 

Soccer 
Continued froIIl pa.e 1. 
Tritons. Earlier this season, 
UCSD crept by Cal Poly-Pomona 
1-0 in a road game. 

Yesterday, it was announced 
that the Tritons will be travel ing 
to Western Regionals to face the 
College ofSt. TholRas in St. Paul, 
Minnesota on Saturday. Should 
they win, the Tritons will face 
either St. Mary's or Cortland 
State, the other two teams in the 
Regional, the following day. If 
tbey win the regional , UCSD will 
have a better chance to host the 
nationals than ever before. 

V-Ball 
Continued from pal' 1. 

..... -Diana Klintworth was named 
Most Valuable Player. 

After baving their winning 
streak over Division III teams 
Itopped at 41 , the Tritons have 
now won four straight matches in 
convincing fashion and are back 
on track as they prepare to enter 
the Regional Tournament and 
embark on their quest to put a 
fifth banner upon the raften.

Tritons Dominate UCSD / Mizuno Tournex. 

Women's Volleyball Still the Team to Beat Men '5 Soccer: Undefeated! 
Women's Soccer: 

By BRIAN ITOW 
SIGf! Writer 

After masquerading as a 
nm-of-the-miU Division III vol-
leyball squad for the past couple of 
weeks, the UCSD women's vol-
leyball team was unmasked as the 
power that it is last weekend at 
the Tritons' own little Halloween 
party. 

The invited guests were ob-
viously haunted by the four Cham-
pionship Banners that hung from 
the rafters of the gym as they 
watched the Tritons easily cap-
ture the UCSD/ Mizuno Volley-
ball Tournament crown. UCSD 
won all four of its matches over 
Grand Canyon, La Verne, al t . 
San Bernardino, and Menlo to 
improve its overall record to 28-8.

IeYeII in a row. In yeater-The Tritons opened tourna-

ment play against Grand Canyon 
College. They quickly rolled to a 

2~ lead as the Tritons won the 
games 15-4 and IS-8. After that, 
Doug Dannevik decided to try 
different combinations with his 
younger players. The team seemed 
to stumble for a minute, losing 
the next two games 14-16and 1~15 
before Jetting things back to-
sether and scoring a decisive 1.5-3 
victory in the final game of the 
match. 

Junior Diana Klintworth and senior Laurie Bertanyi were both selected to the AII -Tournament team this 
weekend. Klintworth was also selected as the tournament's MVP.

Thien NIUye11, Mike Lo-

and Chria HaDllCn. Resion-

The Tritons faced the Univer-
sity of La Verne in their second 
match Friday night. It was prob-
ably their most important match 
of the season. At one point this 
year, the Tritons had tallied 41 
straight victories over Division III 
opponents - datina back to 1986 
when they lost to Menlo College. 
However, the University of La 
Verne pulled an upset over the 
Tritons on Oct. I S, ending their 
streak and proving that they 

could be beat in Division Ill . 
A second loss to La Verne 

would have further deteriorated 
the confidence of a Triton squad 
that had been playing very medio-
cre volleyball for the past couple 
of weeks and, perhaps more im-
portantly, would have placed their 
number one Western Region 
ranking in jeopardy. 

The Tritons did not let that 
happen as they swept to an easy 
15-9, 15-4, 15-10 victory. 

"Against La Verne, we played 
as well as I expected us to ," Dan-
nevik said. "If we continue to play 
at that level we'l be right on sche-
dule to accomplish our goals and 
those are to win regionals and 
nationals." 

Dee Dee Bigelow agreed , "It 
really helped us - beating La 
Verne last night. We feel strong 
again as a team. We had this feel-
ing at the beginning of the year 
and seemed to have lost it. But 
now we have it back." 

Coming off its victory over La 
Verne, UCSD was able to clinch 
the championship by mowing over 
an outmatched CSU San Bernar-
dino squad I S-4, I S-8, 15-3 on 
Saturday morning. With the vic-
tory, the Tritons improved their 
tournament record to 3-0. Grand 
Canyon College and the Univer-
sity of La Verne followed with 
records of 2-2 and no chance to 
catch the tournament victors .

Swimming and Diving Teams Hit the Water 
By CARIN RESNICK 
Contributing Writ~r 

While most people have packed 
away their swimsuits, opting to 
wait for next summer's wanner 
weather, UCSD's swimmers and 
divers have just hit the water to 
begin their 1988-89 season. 

The Tritons' men's and wo-
men's swim teams got a taste of 
competition with an intrasquad 
pentathlon on Saturday. Each 
team member raced in five basic 
events which incorporated the 
four strokes: freestyle, backstroke, 
breaststroke, and fly. The object 
of the event was to accumulate 
the lowest possibk times. 

Shannon Smith. a first-year 
student from Canada, topped the 

men's competition with a cumula-
tive time of 4:44.07, setting a new 
UCSD freshperson pentathlon 
record . Taking charge of the 
women's field was Joan Macau-
lay, who turned in a cumulative 
time of 5:2S.31 . This included 
pentathlon record-breaking 
times in the 1000yard individual 
medley and the IOO-yard back-
stroke. 

Saturday'S event ignites what is 
sure to be an exciting season of 
swimming. Last year the teams 
had tremendous success. The men's 
team finished third at the NCAA 
Championships, just missing 
second place by one point. Mean-
while, the women's team grabbed 
the number two spot. Together, 
the men's and women's teams had 
a total of 36 swimmers qualifying 

for Nationals and 24 swimmers 
named as All-Americans. 

Head coach Bill Morgan has 
high expectations for both the 
men's and women's teams this 
year. "We've got a young squad, 
but both our teams are signifi-
cantly stronger than last year." 
The theme of the upcoming sea-
son, according to Morgan, is "in-
creased committment. .. This tran-
slates into a 25-30 percent increase 
in the time and effort spent by 
each team member. In layman's 
terms, swimmers are spending 
four hours a day in the pool, 
swimming 12,000 to 15,000 yards. 
This would roughly be an equi-
valent of running 8-10 miles a 
day.

championship of the tournament, 
the Tritons got off to a sluggish 
start in a virtually meaningless 
closing match. Then, they rolled 
to an easy 16-14, I S-8, I S-S vic-
tory over Menlo College to finish 
at W. In a mistake-filled first 
game, the Tritons fell behind 11-6 
before winning 10 of the next 13 
points to win 16-14. Playing with-
