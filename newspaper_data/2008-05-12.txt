With only days until the Sun 
God Festival debuts in its new form, 
the event’s programmers and their 
staff will be promoting it in full 
force to familiarize attendees with 
new entry procedures. Meanwhile, 
publicity teams are tasked with 
informing anxious students about 
the festival’s first-ever makeover, 
which this year saw its organiza-
tion and programming completely 
restructured.

The campus’ largest annual 
event will offer free entrance to 
UCSD undergraduates through 
a wristband admission system. 
Wristbands will be available for 
pickup May 12-15; none will be 
available May 16, the day of the

Free Speech Hits Policy Roadblock

By Serena Renner

While revision to the campus free 
speech and assembly policy is nearing 
completion, the University of California 
Office of the President recently released 
a new set of regulations that could 
impose administrative restrictions on 
the activities of nonaffiliates.

have been wrestling with the question 
of whether to allow nonaffiliates to 
convene without a reservation. 

Last November, the University 
Centers Advisory Board adopted the 
Price Center Plaza Limited Public 
Forum Policy, which shut out the public 
by only allowing UCSD students, fac-
ulty and staff with valid identification 
to engage in public speaking activities 
in Price Center.

Now, the issue has re-emerged sys-
temwide via a new UCOP proposal 
governing everything from nudity 
to demonstrations by nonaffiliates. 
Among other restrictions, no nonaf-

Since the start of Winter Quarter, 
a committee of administrators, fac-
ulty, department representatives and 
students has been busy redrafting the 
UCSD policy regulating free speech, 
assembly and distribution of literature.

Released last June, the original pro-
posal received harsh criticism from 
students, faculty and free-speech advo-
cates like the American Civil Liberties 
Union, prompting the creation of a 
revision committee to address these 
concerns.

While the students on the com-
mittee have been working to craft one 
overarching document to outline per-
mitted speech and assembly across the 
entire university, some areas of campus See SPEECH, page 7

QUESTIONING THE 
PRICE OF DONATION
In the growing egg 
donation industry, 
college-age women face 
issues of regulation and 
financial incentive.

By Alyssa Bereznak
Focus Editor

The ad is familiar: a fertility clinic 
or personal ad seeking a “healthy 
young female” for egg donation  
offers up to $20,000 in compensation. 
Whether a college student decides to 
donate her eggs for altruistic reasons 
or to pay off student loans, there’s 
a risk that isn’t included in the fine 
print.

“When you see giant numbers 
that say $50,000 and read an ad look-
ing for someone that sounds like you, 
something lights up in your mind, 
‘Oh, wait, an opportunity,’” said 
Lauren Berliner, a UCSD communi-
cation doctoral student. “But there’s 
nothing in there about what you’ll 
be doing to get that money. It sounds 
like the best deal in the world. Help a 
couple in need and earn $5,000 while 
you’re at it? Who wouldn’t want to do 
that? ‘Hey, sign me up.’”

Berliner, who produced and 
directed a documentary on the egg 
donation process titled “All in 
One Basket,” faced a similar sit-
uation when, after joking with 
her family that she could pay off 
her $30,000 in student loans by 

donating her eggs, decided to research 
the endeavor.

After searching through 20 Google 
pages of fertility clinic Web sites that 
failed to specify the process, she final-
ly found an article in which a bio-ethi-
cist not only described the process, 
but detailed a number of associated 
risks. Her research led her to make the 
documentary, which takes a critical 
look into the process of egg donation.

“I wondered how much the aver-
age donor was aware of the kind of 
speculation that was going on around 
these issues,” Berliner said.

While the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine provides a list 
of recommended regulations for egg 
donors, fertility clinics and recipients 
involved in the process, the only offi-
cial requirement currently enforced 
by the Food and Drug Administration 
is that prospective donors be screened 
for clinical evidence of communicable 
infections and diseases.

Cardiac Physician Receives 
Prestigious Award

A UCSD physician received 
the coveted Ellis Island Medal of 
Honor, an award designed to recog-
nize Americans of diverse origins for 
extraordinary contributions to their 
communities, last week in recogni-
tion of influential work in the field of 
heart and lung surgery. 

Stuart Jamieson, director of the 
Lung Transplant Center at UCSD 
and chief of the division of cardiotho-
racic surgery, was recognized for his 
achievements at a May 10 awards 
ceremony on Ellis Island. 

“I am honored to be added to 
this distinguished list of names,” 
Jamieson said. “Previous honorees 
have brought their expertise and 
influenced others in so many diverse 
areas of life; it’s really outstanding.” 

As a pioneer in his field, Jamieson 
has contributed extensively to 
research surrounding cardiac sur-
gery. His innovative therapies and 
leadership of the UCSD Pulmonary 
Thromboendarterectomy Program 
have gained him international renown 
among his colleagues.

“Dr. Jamieson represents the best 
America has to offer in medicine and 
in academia,” Dean of the UCSD 
School of Medicine David Brenner 
said. “At heart, he is a pioneer, with an 
entrepreneurial spirit. People like him 
are what make this country great.”

A native of Zimbabwe, Jamieson 
left his country in the midst of a civil 
war, traveling to London. There he 
attended the University of London, 
waiting tables to pay for his educa-
tion. Today, Jamieson is one of the 
most respected individuals in the 
field of heart and lung transplanta-

tion, boasting one of the highest sur-
gery success rates in the world. 

The Ellis Island Medal of Honor 
was established in 1986 by the 
National Coalition of Organizations 
with the intent of “[paying] tribute to 
the ancestry groups that make up 
America’s unique cultural mosaic.” 
The award annually honors the “the 
immigrant experience on Ellis Island, 
through which millions of immigrants 
passed on their way to a new life in 
America.”

Scott Named Head of 
Community College System

California state Sen. Jack Scott 
(D-Altadena) was named 14th chan-
cellor of the California Community 
Colleges system last week follow-
ing an 11-year career in the state 
Legislature. 

“The future of our state econo-
my and even the California dream 
are tied to increasing the number 
of Californians who both enter and 
complete their college education,” 
Scott said in a statement.”

Scott, who held an influential 
position as chairman of the Senate 
Education Committee, worked within 
the community college system for 
23 years prior to his time in the 
Legislature.

“Senator Scott is a terrific choice 
to lead the California Community 
Colleges,” University of California 
President Robert C. Dynes said in a 
statement. “He has provided distin-
guished leadership to public higher 
education in California, and he has 
demonstrated a lifelong commitment 
to young people and their educa-
tional opportunities.”

as well as other grants.
The new center will be the first 

in the nation to bring together 
four organizations that will share 
resources, staff and expertise.

Vice President  of 
Communications at the Burnham 
Institute Andrea Moser said the 
purpose of this unprecedented col-
laboration is to encourage expand-
ed research to speed the process of 
understanding the potential uses of 

stem cells.
“The idea is by having the four 

institutions come together, we can 
have a more robust program,” Moser 
said. “It’s really going to accelerate 
progress on how stem cells can cure 
disease.”

The 12 research centers are 
expected to derive more than $560 
million in additional funds from 
charitable donations and each insti-
tution’s own financial reserves. 

So far, the new San Diego facility 
has gathered enough independent-

total of $3 billion over the next 10 
years to fund such research and 
create new facilities aimed at under-
standing the potential uses of stem 
cells for medical purposes.

“This Prop. 71 stem-cell research 
facilities program is one of the larg-
est building programs ever dedicat-
ed for a new field of medical science 
and it will deliver an impact that 
will be felt worldwide,” chairman of 
the board overseeing the stem-cell 
program Robert N. Klein said in a 
statement.

UCSD, one of nine University of 
California campuses funded by the 
proposition, is expected to receive 
$43 million for a new research cen-
ter slated for construction on Torrey 
Pines Road. The amount is the sec-
ond-highest grant awarded to a 
research institution next to Stanford’s 
$43.5-million grant.

Research at UCSD will be conduct-
ed by the San Diego Consortium for 
Regenerative Medicine, which con-
sists of UCSD, the Scripps Research 
Institute, the Burnham Institute 
for Medical Research and the Salk 
Institute for Biological Studies. 

One of the conditions of receiv-
ing the grant is that recipients must 
raise additional funds equivalent 
to 20 percent of the amount given. 
UCSD is expected to raise an addi-
tional $72 million to complete 
funding for the new building, which 
is expected to cost $115 million, 
California Institute for Regenerative 
Medicine representatives said in a 
statement. This funding will come 
from philanthropic gifts and loans 

ly raised funding to install nearly 
800,000 square feet of additional 
research space and house 2,200 
more scientists over the course of 
the next two years.

“These facilities will house basic 
and clinical researchers working col-
laboratively, with stem cell-specific 
core labs literally ‘down the hall’ 
— an arrangement that is instru-
mental to our ability to accelerate 
the pace of research toward clinical 
application,” CIRM President Alan 
Trounson said.

When factoring in faculty 
recruitment and other costs, the 
investments statewide total more 
than $1.1 billion.

According to Moser, local recruit-
ment of faculty will not be an issue.

“There’s a tremendous wealth of 
talent in the area,” she said.

The $3-billion measure will not 
affect the state’s budget since the 
funds are raised by 30-year stem-
cell research bonds. 

Additionally, the bond will cre-
ate thousands of construction jobs 
that legislators are hoping will help 
ease California’s current economic 
problems.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
expressed optimism about the proj-
ects that will be created by the 
grant.

“This kind of public-private 
investment in a growing jobs sec-
tor is exactly the kind of good news 
our economy needs right now,” 
Schwarzenegger said in a statement.

filiate is permitted to gather or demon-
strate on university property without 
prior approval. Members of the public 
are also barred from distributing leaf-
lets or advertisements without authori-
zation, and violation of the policy could 
result in a misdemeanor offense.

According to Graduate Student 
Association committee representative 
Benjamin Balthaser, the policy crimi-
nalizes behavior otherwise protected 
under the U.S. Constitution.

Additionally, it means that any 
public gathering, from tabling to 
marching to praying, that has not 
obtained approval can be shut down, 
he said. Even student-sponsored pro-
tests could be stopped to check UC 
identification.

Balthaser added that the antiwar, 
civil rights and more recently, the 
student-labor movements, were all 
built on community involvement. By 
restricting activity, the public will no 
longer have access to an institution 
funded and operated in its name, 
he said.

“The university is becoming an 
intellectually and physically gated 
community that’s harder and harder 
for people to get to,” Balthaser said. 
“Part of having a democratic institu-
tion is having the doors open and 
mixing people together.”

If the UCOP policy is approved, 
the UCSD revision will change sub-
stantially, said Associated Students 
committee representative Carol-
Irene Southworth, because the limi-
tations on nonaffiliates do not cur-
rently fit within the UCSD policy. 
The new proposal may also pose 
a setback for the campus revision 
that has made significant strides, 
Balthaser said.

“We are trying to construct the uni-
versity as an open space for free speech, 
and the UCOP policy takes away any 
local control we might have,” he said. 

Price Center has been the main site 

where UCSD has faced problems with 
nonaffiliated community members.

According to University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino, the UCAB poli-
cy, which prohibits activity of the public 
without a reservation, was one attempt 
to strike a balance between the interests 
of students and campus organizations 
that want to engage in speech activi-
ties in Price Center and diners who 
want to eat and socialize without being 
disturbed. 

Communications professor and 
committee member Robert Horwitz 
said that although Price Center is a key 
free-speech area, it also serves other 
important functions.

“Personally, I don’t want to hear 
the Jesus freaks ranting all the time,” 
he said. “People want to sit out and 
eat lunch and not always have to be 
harangued, whether it might be from 
people that I might like or people that 
you might like.”

The committee agrees that there 
needs to be room for spontaneous 
protest from students and nonstu-
dents alike, Horwitz said. The chal-
lenge, however, is in not allowing this 
protest to disrupt university activity 
on a regular basis. 

“If Bush bombs Iran, there should 
be the freedom for spontaneous dem-

onstration that may get in the way of 
university function,” Horwitz said. “It’s 
not about the depth of disruption but 
about how much there is. Is this going 
to go on one day or every day?”

Another challenge has centered 
on  whether to write clearly defined 
rules or leave some areas vague to 
offer more protections, Horwitz said.

According to Balthaser, some  
want to make the policy more rigid to 
lift responsibilities of enforcement off 
the shoulders of the administration 
and police, because shutting down 
protests would produce bad publicity 
for them.

“If [administrators] pre-emptively 
stop demonstrations before they hap-
pen, it saves them from that ugly PR,” 
he said. 

On the other hand, Horwitz said, 
leaving the policy vague could give 
too much interpretive power to the 
police, allowing for inconsistent pun-
ishment, whereas a defined line could 
tell them exactly when an activity 
becomes illegal.

“The hard part is figuring out the 
balance between the bright lines and 
the gray areas of vagueness,” he said.

While debate has heated up, the 
policy revision is progressing because 
the group is expressing concerns 
about areas that need to be addressed, 
Southworth said.

“I still think we’re headed in the 
right direction,” Southworth said. “I 
feel good about getting the policy [the 
students] want out of this group.”

Students on the committee will 
host a town-hall meeting about the 
campus revision and the UCOP pol-
icy during the eighth week of the 
quarter. On May 28, there will be 
a public hearing about the UCOP 
policy at UCLA, during which UCSD 
students on the committee plan to 
make a presentation.

in-depth report released in Fall 
Quarter, which found that campus 
departments and administrators 
were irked by the event’s lack of 
community spirit and ineffective 
safety measures. 

In the remodeling process, 
programmers added a host of stu-
dent-related activities to the festi-
val including “Triton Avenue” and 
the “Midway,” the former hosting a 
number of spaces for student orga-
nizations along Hopkins Drive and 
the latter being a site for student 
artwork and films.

Securing funding for the broader 
festival has proven difficult. The 
programming department has 
solicited a number of campus enti-
ties for funds, including the Office 
of Student Affairs, the Graduate 
Student Association and Alumni 
Association. 

Berg said all three organizations 
declined support. Programmers 
also appeared before the A.S. 
Council twice this year asking for 
extra funds, and most recently were 
granted $30,000 in March to defray 
security costs, which have doubled 
this year. 

While A.S. Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Sarah 
Chang said that the council lacks 
the financial flexibility to allocate 
any more funds, Berg added that 
the event’s costs will likely rise in 
coming years.

As a result, programmers have 
enlisted a three-person team to 

seek sponsorships. So far, Berg said 
that they have utilized a number 
of small-business sponsorships to 
reduce production costs such as 
food for programming staff. 

The resulting discounts on the 
event’s final price tag, which sits 
above $400,000 this year, have 
allowed the programming depart-
ment to include most of the activi-
ties it planned for this year’s festival, 
Berg said. However, he said he was 
still wary of the event’s fiscal future, 
with programmers this year already 
forced to cut out some aspects of 
production — such as a planned 
Ferris wheel attraction — to meet 
budget deficits. 

Larger corporate partnerships with 
the programming department are in 
the works for the future, Berg said. 
Programmers are hoping to build rela-
tionships with several corporate liai-
sons that will be attending to survey 
this year’s festival. Programmers also 
recently added three acts to the festival 
lineup: hip-hop act Living Legends, 
indie rock band Say Anything and DJ 
Richard Vission. 

“There was disappointment 
when we initially released our line-
up,” Berg said. “But the feedback 
from students has been much more 
positive after we released the last 
three acts. With over 40 acts total, 
the whole lineup is much more 
extensive and eclectic  in nature 
than programmers have ever pro-
vided before.”

Festival Programmers Seek 
Stronger Student Engagement

Sponsored by Rep. George Miller 
(D-Calif.), the bill raced through 
the House of Representatives and 
the Senate after being introduced 
last month. The Senate passed the 
bill on April 30 in a unanimous 
vote. 

Bush devoted his entire final 
weekly radio address in April to 
higher-education issues in support 
of the bill, saying that giving the 
administration greater authority to 
buy federal student loans would 
help ensure that students have con-
tinued access to tuition assistance 
through the federal loan program. 

Although Bush spoke in favor 
of passing HR 5715, he also called 
it a measure that would be neither 
lasting nor used unless completely 
necessary. 

“The authority the bill grants 
is temporary and would be used 
only if it became apparent there 
was a shortage of loans available 
to students,” Bush said in the radio 
address.

President and CEO of the 
National Association of Student 
Financial Aid Administrators Philip 
R. Day Jr. called the bill a coup for 
students and parents seeking assis-
tance in financing college.

“We regard the bill as a great vic-
tory, as it pushes students to borrow 
from the federal program, rather 
than from the private sector, which 
is a riskier decision,” he said.

The bill increases the maximum 
annual unsubsidized Stafford Loan 
amounts that may be borrowed 
by undergraduate dependent stu-
dents through the Federal Family 
Education Loan program by $2,000. 
These unsubsidized loans are avail-
able to any student, regardless of 
financial need.

The maximum limit on these 
loans has been increased from 
$23,000 to $31,000 for dependent 
undergraduates, and from $46,000 
to $57,500 for independent under-
graduates. 

In addition, the law benefits par-
ents who choose to take out a PLUS 
Loan — a loan from the federal 

government covering the amount 
of their child’s education — by add-
ing a six-month grace period to pay 
back the loan after their student has 
ended his or her full-time college 
career. 

“Instead of making parents pay 
back this loan while their student 
is still in school, they now can wait 
until their child has finished their 
education to begin worrying about 
paying the PLUS Loan back,” Day 
said.

The bill also permits the 
Department of Education to desig-
nate an entire institution as eligible 
for “lender of last-resort loans” 
— loans that students previous-
ly qualified for only after having 
been denied by two loan agencies 
and supplying this documenta-
tion to their financial aid depart-
ment. Through this stipulation, if 
Secretary of Education Margaret 
Spellings determines the education-
al institution meets a “minimum 
threshold” of students that cannot 
obtain a conventional loan through 
the FFEL program, the institution 
can then qualify for LLR participa-
tion.

“HR 5715 makes it easier for 
students who are unable to get a 
loan because of circumstances such 
as a poor credit history by put-
ting the onus onto the educational 
institution to find a lender of last 
resort loan for their students that 
find themselves in this situation,” 
Day said.

The bill also gives Spellings the 
power to purchase loans from pri-
vate lenders, and urges collabora-
tion with Secretary of the Treasury 
Henry Paulson in this task. 

“The two must look at the pos-
sibility of doing whatever they can 
to encourage and advance the idea 
that it is important to maintain 
a strong market and make credit 
available to students and parents,” 
Day said.

The bill will take effect for loans 
first disbursed on or after July 1.

If there is one sector that can ride 
through California’s rocky economic 
times, it is stem-cell research. The 
field has been budding, and its poten-
tial cultivated, since voters passed 
Proposition 71 in 2004, creating the 
California Institute for Regenerative 
Medicine and opening up millions in 
funds for research. Now, the legisla-
tion has doled out its biggest funding 
package yet, distributing $271 mil-
lion for the construction of stem-cell 
facilities and buildings.

UCSD, receipient of the second 
highest amount of funds, is forg-
ing the research trail with its part 
in the San Diego Consortium for 
Regenerative Medicine, a mega-
partnership linking the university 
with the Scripps Research Institute, 
the Burnham Institute for Medical 
Research and the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies. The consortium 
combines its resources to produce 
an unrivaled pool of researchers and 
staff to advance stem-cell research.

The campus will receive $43 mil-
lion for a new research center that will 
be built on Torrey Pines Road. The 
center will undoubtedly become the 
epicenter for local stem-cell research, 
tying together four titans of scientific 
research in an unprecedented large-
scale effort.

Science pundits, researchers and 
several politicians are applauding the 
progress. It is a far cry from recent 
years, when CIRM was entangled in 
lawsuits and accusations of conflicts 
of interest. CIRM was unable to issue 
millions in research bonds because of 
a 2007 lawsuit that claimed the orga-
nization’s board members were play-
ing favorites when distributing funds. 
Piled upon that are CIRM’s countless 
opponents who morally object to the 
organization’s work. Considering the 
high hurdles CIRM has had to leap, it 
is a sweet wonder to see Proposition 
71 pay out such a large dividend.

The latest collection of building 
grants will, within two years, fund a 
total of 12 research centers, 800,000 
square feet of space for research 
and 2,200 scientists. Collaborative 
research will occur inside the facili-

I hope that Novick can serve 

as an example for all Americans 
and that it is not just some innate 
quality of enlightened Oregonians 
that has fostered the diminutive 
politician’s march on Washington. 
Instead of trying to make people 
ignore his obvious differences, 
Novick has embraced his individu-
ality and has used it to show how 

Oregonian Candidate Offers Political Hook, Literally
There is a longstanding ideal in our American system of democracy that any person 
can be a politician — that no mat-
ter who you are or where you’re 
from, you can rise up and be a 
leader of this nation. 

I never fully believed that prin-
ciple, choosing instead to think that 
only wealthy, marketable individu-
als with no obvious defects could 
become elected officials. But any 
preconceived notions I had about 
what it takes to become a successful 
American politician flew out the 
window when I heard about Steve 
Novick.

My roommate is from Corvallis, 
Ore., and just the other day was 
filling out his absentee ballot for 
the local and state elections that 

into Harvard Law School at the 
age of 18.

So what could be at all spe-

cial about Novick that would make 
me surprised to see him run for 
Senate? How about the fact that he 

will occur in November. It was in 
talking with him that I learned 
the awe-inspiring, if not seeming-
ly science-fiction laden story of 
Novick. Novick is running for the 
U.S. Senate as one of Oregon’s rep-
resentatives and it appears he actu-
ally stands a pretty decent chance 
of winning. 

Novick is a Democrat who 
worked for nearly 10 years 
fighting for reform within the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
and from the beginning was an 
outspoken critic of the war in Iraq. 
He even spearheaded a campaign 
against illegal lottery distribution 
that redirected millions of dollars 
to Oregon’s public schools. His fan-
tastic moral fiber aside, the man is 
a genius, having gained admission 

is a legal midget with a hook for a 
left hand?

That’s right, after being born 
without fibula bones in both legs, 
Novick stands at a proud four feet, 
nine inches tall. As for the hook, he 
was also born missing a left hand and 
in its place has a metal prosthesis. 
This man has been able to accom-
plish more with one hand and Mini-
Me-sized proportions than most 
Americans could ever dream of.

What shocks me is not Novick’s 
triumph over his disabilities — I 
try to never doubt the potential of 
the human spirit — it is the success 
he has been having in the political 
world. It is a very welcome surprise 
that Novick has had such a success-
ful campaign and that his physical 
characteristics have not seemed to See TASTE, page 5

Don’t Tread

STUDENT LIFE — Somehow, history always seems 
to repeat itself. Will people ever learn? The national 
government didn’t learn anything from Vietnam, pull-
ing the country into another needless war, only this 
time it’s the terrorists, not communists, we’re chasing. 
The federal government didn’t learn anything from 
the civil rights movement or those hot ’60s summers, 
still pushing around political minorities, but now 
discriminating against Latinos with border-long walls 
instead of prosecuting blacks with Jim Crow policies. 
And the University of California administration didn’t 
learn anything from the UC Berkeley Free Speech 
Movement, deciding to still introduce a new speech 
policy that would limit the rights of nonaffiliates on 
the public university’s 10 campuses.

The policy changes — which haven’t been final-
ized and will be discussed at UCLA in a May 28 
public hearing — come in the middle of a nearly 
yearlong debate over UCSD’s own free-speech poli-
cies. The discussion about UCSD-specific policies 
started last June when administrators ambushed 
students mid-finals week in an attempt to push 
through a draconian proposal. Since then, a commit-
tee formed to redraft the policy, with the University 
Centers Advisory Board throwing its hat in the ring 
with Price Center-specific legislation. But in light of 
Sun God and the Price Center expansion, the issue 
had been more or less placed on the back burner so 
the committee could work. Until now. These system-
wide changes would obviously deeply affect decisions 
made by the UCSD committee, even though the UC 
Office of the President proposal deals solely with 
nonaffiliate behavior.

UCSD free-speech policy committee members 
plan to make a presentation at the UCLA hearing, 
but it’s time for the common student to wake up and 
take a stand for the rights we’re being stripped of. 
Such complete disregard for First Amendment rights 
is unacceptable by any standard, but from one of the 
country’s best public universities it is disgusting. 

Supporters of this free-speech infringement 
— both from the UCSD and systemwide policies 
— argue that nonaffiliates tend to bother students 
and faculty, citing, for example, the religious zealots 
who frequent Price Center. But this logic is flawed 
at best. This is a public institution in a free country, 
and if someone is bothering you with their Library 
Walk demonstration at lunchtime you should han-
dle the situation like an adult and choose to utilize 
the other 98 percent of our vastly large campus. 
Student Center was just renovated to include very 
pleasant eating courtyards, Price Center has an 
entire new wing designed just for eating and loung-
ing or if you have to eat on one of those thick 
concrete Library Walk slabs you’re in luck — the 
pathway is so long you probably won’t even be able 
to hear the guy down at the other end. 

As students of this generation, we’ve lived almost 
all of our politically aware lives under the shadow of 
Sept. 11. We’ve become pretty used to surrendering 
our rights in the name of patriotism. We’ve learned 
that when it comes to authorities, you’re either with 
them or against them — and that’s a fight no one 
wants to take on these days, as the latter can mean 
making yourself a target for complete ostracization. 
But the careless dismissal of core freedoms, which 
we’re unfortunately becoming accustomed to, isn’t 
normal and it isn’t right. This country was founded 
by strong protestors who weren’t afraid to stand up 
for their beliefs and its rich history was nurtured by 
similar protest movements. 

The time to break free from our complacent 
shells is now — if the public university isn’t a safe 
space for free thought and discussion, perhaps such 
a space no longer exists. As students, it is our duty to 
stop these ludicrous limitations on freedom; it is our 
responsibility to act now and ensure complete liberty 
and equality for all on our college campuses. 

We need to remember the days of our UC 
Berkeley predecessors. Like them, we too have the 
power to make meaningful changes in our environ-
ment. And making your voice heard is simple; it 
often won’t take even an hour out of your day. 

Read up on the proposed policies and inform your 
peers. Write letters to Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue, Chancellor Marye Anne Fox or incoming 
UC President Mark G. Yudof and get three of your 
friends to do the same. Visit the A.S. Council to dis-
cuss your concerns with student leaders. Get in touch 
with the free-speech policy committee to give your 
input. Attend the various public hearings and town hall 
meetings. Participate in rallies and peaceful protests on 
Library Walk. And don’t ever compromise your rights.

he can deal with diversity. One of 
Novick’s campaign slogans is “The 
fighter with the 
hard left hook.” 
Genius. 

If only all 
politicians, and 
Americans in gen-
eral, could follow 
Novick’s lead and 
not be shy about 
from what makes 
them unique. 

I feel that 
far too often 
Americans try to 
conform to one 
ideal image, to 
become this one 
person that they 
think everyone around them wants 
them to be. Novick has spent his 
whole life proving to the world 
that nothing can stop him from 
being a strong, positive contributor 
to society, regardless of physical 
limitations. 

Even though I cannot person-
ally cast a vote for Novick, he has 

inspired me to look for the under-
lying qualities in politicians and 
to lean more toward electing a 

candidate who 
focuses more on 
making actual 
change than 
merely getting 
elected. Novick 
has promised to 
stand up to cor-
rupt Washington 
politicians and 
to hold them 
accountable to 
the American 
public once 
again. 

Considering 
the height at 
which Novick 

stands up to most men, and the 
menace of his left hook, what better 
way to keep dishonest politicians in 
line than by reaching straight out 
and grabbing the bull by the horns? 
I never would have thought it con-
ceivable, but as Novick’s campaign 
has proven, in American politics, 
anything is possible.

ties,  putting stem-cell core labs side-
by-side with core research staff. Such 
close partnerships will create ground-
level progress in the field between 
staffers and scientists. Meanwhile, the 
state is driving the field forward with 
top-down support from Sacramento.

Best of all, San Diego is a major 
beneficiary of the facilities program. 
The funds will encourage growth 
within the state’s already burgeoning 
stem-cell industry; as one of the few 
states that receives political fund-
ing for such research, California is 
able to utilize an industry generally 
unavailable elsewhere. In addition, 
thousands of jobs in construction 
and research will be made available, 
adding much needed revitalization to 
the state’s sluggish economy, a point 
that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
said was one of the program’s best 
byproducts.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

However, ASRM’s ethical and medi-
cal reccommendations are much more 
extensive.

According to the organization, 
once a prospective egg donor is chosen 
by a recipient, she should complete a 
medical questionnaire that describes 
both her personal and familial medi-
cal histories. In addition to describing 
the donor’s hobbies, personality and 
educational background, the question-

naire should assess 
her motivation for 

donating and explore her 
sexual, substance abuse and 

psychological histories. After 
completing the questionnaire, the 

donor should then review her history 
with a doctor and go through a com-
prehensive physical examination, which 
includes testing for sexually transmit-
ted diseases, evaluation of blood type 
and count and genetic screening for 
diseases common to her ethnicity.

In addition to assessing physi-
cal health, ASRM recommends that 
donors complete a written psychomet-
ric test and then meet with a mental 
health professional to further discuss 
ethical and psychosocial aspects of 
donation. Ultimately, according to the 

ASRM, these 
recommendations 

are in place to ensure that the 
donor makes her decision through 

“informed consent.”
“There’s a historical background 

against which principles of informed 
consent developed,” Director of 
Biomedical Ethics Seminars Mary 
Devereaux said. “And part of what the 
principle of informed consent is trying 
to do is make sure that people who are 
participating in these activities are not 
under coercion.” 

Despite ASRM’s efforts to regulate 
the egg-donation industry, many com-
panies only adhere to the FDA’s mini-
mum regulations.

“There’s absolutely a risk,” said 
Theresa Erickson, president and CEO 
of Conceptual Options, a surrogate 
and egg-donor agency based in Poway. 
“There’s no licensing required to have 
a donor agency. You need to make 
sure you find someone in business for 
at least five years. Just about anybody 
could open up an agency in their back-
yard or home as long as they follow the 
FDA regulations.”

Erickson, who wrote “Assisted 
Reproduction: The Complete Guide 
to Having a Baby with the Help of a 
Third Party,” said that because the egg-
donation process is relatively new, rec-
ommended regulations are still being 
changed as new information comes in.

“The process is still developing,” 
Erickson said. “For instance, I was an 
egg donor and I did it seven or eight 
times. After doing so I consulted my 
doctor and he said I should stop. Now 
in the past couple years, ASRM has 
guidelines that say a donor shouldn’t 
do it more than six times. But they are 
technically just guidelines and ethical 
considerations.”

According to Devereaux, because 
research on young egg donors is scarce, 
there may be unknown long-term risks 
or side effects.   

“The research cohorts we’ve been 
looking at are mainly women who are 
infertile already and older,” Devereaux 
said. “So extracting those assumptions 
about safety to a younger population 
who don’t have fertility problems, who 
are perfectly healthy and who many 
of whom are going to want to go on 
and have their own children … it’s a 
different outcome and it’s a different 

cost-benefit. You don’t have common 
standards so you don’t have a common 
database that you can go back to for 
looking at the risks to donors, to recipi-
ents, and to children born in this way.”

After a donor has completed the 
mental and physical health screen-
ings, she begins in vitro fertilization 
stimulation therapy that entails the 
injection of a series of fertility medica-
tions meant to stimulate and increase 
the production of eggs in her body. 
Some women have experienced ovar-
ian hyperstimulation syndrome, a side 
effect that occurs from the use of fer-
tility medication that inflicts abdomi-
nal pain, bloating and, in some cases, 
results in death. Serious side-effects are 
treated by draining accumulated fluid 
from the abdominal or pleural cavi-
ties. According to Berliner, the fertility 
medication greatly increases the eggs 
produced in the menstrual cycle.

“The women I talked to said it 
feels like having PMS, but to the nth 
degree,” Berliner said. “You feel bloat-
ed, you’re not allowed to drink or do 
drugs or have sex during this period, 
and depending on how things go with

S lightly obstructed by construc-tion on University Avenue in Hillcrest, Babette Schwartz is 
a deliciously eclectic gift emporium 
where you can find the perfect pres-

Owned by a fabulously glamorous drag 
queen with mile-high hair and a self-
proclaimed affinity for retail therapy, 
Babette Schwartz has an inescapable 
campy charm. This gift shop lures you 
in with its garland fringe and blaring 
salsa music, and keeps you there with its 
wide selection of offbeat gifts.

The store’s merchandise is the 
perfect blend of sugar and spice, and 
sweetness and smut. For pop-culture 
enthusiasts, there are gift sections for 
“I Love Lucy,” Elvis, “The Wizard of 
Oz,” DC Comics and “Peanuts” memo-
rabilia. The gifts range from magnets 

to lunch boxes and cookie jars. On 
the raunchier side, Babette Schwartz is 
the ultimate destination for 21st birth-
days and bachelorette parties. The shop 
goes beyond festive party hats. offer-
ing candy G-strings, boob pasta and 
a blow-job kit complete with gloves,

most impressive section of the store 
is the religious kitsch section, where 
Mexican idolatry takes the form of La 
Virgen de Guadalupe mouse pads, Jesus 
Band-Aids, stained-glass crucifixes and 
“Jesus Is Coming Breathe Easy” mints. 
Everything in this store has a “babu-
lous” twist to it — ordinary rubber 
duckies become zombie rubber duckies 
and regular Post-it notes become Jeez-it 
notes (the Jesus variation).

While you may want to take half 
of the novel items home, you’ll think 

twice after looking at the prices. A Elvis-
decorated devotional prayer candle will 
set you back $14.99 while a Frida Kahlo

There is a stigma surrounding photography in the digital era, often bordering on paranoia 
now that “Homeland Security” has 
long been a common phrase. Every 
photographer has a personal horror 
story and shares it on one of the many 
blogs and Internet forums dedicated 
to the craft. The standard plot of these 
cautionary anec-
dotes involves 
a hapless cam-
era enthusiast, 
minding his own 
business when he 
takes a picture of 
the wrong bird/
building/bridge 
and incurs the wrath of an overzealous 
security guard or police officer.

A recent high-profile case was that 
of Bilal Hussein, an Iraqi photojour-
nalist who was part of an Associated 
Press team that won the 2005 Pulitzer 
Prize for photography.  United States 
military investigators alleged that he 
had links to insurgents and was in 
possession of bomb-making materi-
als. Hussein spent two years in U.S. 
military custody in Iraq before being 
released in April. During his imprison-
ment he maintained that his activities 
were normal for his job as a war-zone 
photojournalist.

Locally, I have heard tales of UCSD 
photography students getting stopped 
in malls and on campus with demands 
by security staff that they delete their 
pictures or hand over their film — 
something not even a police officer  
would be expected to do unless they 
are taking you into custody. Even if 
you are trespassing, your images are 
your property and your rights to them 
still apply.

It all just makes me wonder why I 
am lacking such a story of infringed lib-
erties. Surely I’ve photographed enough 
to irk the right people, but perhaps the 
worst treatment I can recall receiving is 
just a curt reminder by a security guard 

that I couldn’t photograph at University 
Towne Center’s Westfield Mall — not 
even in its parking lot. It didn’t matter; 
I knew beforehand what the rules were, 
objectionable as they are, and made sure 
to get the shot I needed in the five min-
utes before a guard managed to show 
up. But, I’ve shot everywhere from dive 
bars to a doctor’s office without getting 

hassled.
I’ve noticed a 

few other places 
that are inhospi-
table to cameras. 
One of the most 
obvious is the 
airport, but I still 
didn’t expect an 

attendant working at a parking struc-
ture down the street from San Diego 
International to invoke Sept. 11 when 
telling me I couldn’t photograph land-
ing planes from the top level. The most 
ironic place that photography isn’t 
allowed is in photography museums.

It’s far more often the case that my 
camera has gotten me privileged access, 
like front-row views at concerts, seats 
on the first base line for Padres games 
and free admission to Birch Aquarium.

With the amount of free reign that I 
am used to exercising, it was interesting 
when I got stopped for photograph-
ing in a Whole Foods grocery store of 
all places. This got me pondering the 
fickle nature of photography regula-
tions on private property that is open to 
the public. Grocery stores are a prime 
example, so I figured I ought to assess 
the attitudes of various businesses in 
order to assert my rights as a camera-
carrying citizen.

Since getting camera-blocked at 
Whole Foods, I’ve shot in stores dis-
creetly on plenty of occasions, assum-
ing that if I were found out I wouldn’t 
be welcome. This was just skirting an 
important rights issue, so to press back 
against any real or imagined oppressive 
forces out there, my mode of operation 
recently has been to enter stores with  

camera raised and without shame. 
Even if I got stopped, at least I’d have 
some empathy for my repressed breth-
ren and a story to tell on the Internet 
somewhere.

Wal-Mart was the first store I tested. 
I was a bit timid, so I used my smallest 
camera and put it down when near any 
employees. My fears were unfounded, 
though, as I realized I was near the end 
of my roll. That was when I got bored 
with taking pictures of people picking 
out cheap socks and instead trained my 
lens on the Wal-Mart employees I had 
been avoiding. They didn’t object; their 
looks of confusion as they walked by 
mirrored mine as I wondered why they

10 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MAY 12, 2008

inFOCUS
Six years and more than $70 million later, the new Price Center expansion project launches its grand opening today where students can explore the additional 175,000 square feet of student and administrative offices, study lounges and restaurant dining areas. As the center hub for a burgeoning campus population, the Price Center expansion marks endeavors to create 
a more communal neighborhood for commuter and resident students alike. Most of the new venues will not open until Fall 2008.

PRICE CENTER EXPANSION

Addition to the Stuart Art Collection

In the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes.” This Andy Warhol quote, along with 32 others from contemporary 
thinkers like Malcolm X and Voltaire, is par t of  the wall-to-floor 
design of  the newest addition to the Stuar t Ar t Collection 
entitled, “Another” by ar tist Barbara Kruger. A large black-and-
white mural lines the upper wall featuring two adjacent clocks 
whose hour ly numbers are also punctuated by two-word phrases 
beginning with the word “another”: “another day,” “another 
love,” “another sweater.” The piece also contains two running 
tickers that display the latest news from Reuters, visible from all 
levels of  the interior atrium.

Green Design

The Price Center expansion’s architecs faced a dif ficult challenge: create a sustainable design that mimics a 
traditional unversity town center without creating a harsh impact 
on the environment. The new eco-friendly building features tiled 
flooring composed of  renewable materials, plumbing fixtures 
that incorporate water conser vation, flow controls and an air 
ventilation system that uses a low velocity air displacement 
strategy to lower heating and cooling costs. A new shuttle stop 
on Matthews Lane, along with an added 144 bicycle racks, 
encourages students to consider alternative transpor tation 
methods to cut down on carbon emissions. 

Community Space

The expansion’s flexibility allows students to experience the new site in their own way. The four-storied atrium contains 
more than 18 student organization offices with six indoor 
lounges, 24-hour group study rooms with a nearby computer 
lab and retail facilities including a full ser vice bank, post office, 
hair salon and grocery store. Six new food vendors, including 
Burger King, Tapioca Express, Santorini Island Grill, Bombay 
Coast, a creperie and a pasta restaurant, will be located on the 
first level of  the center with an added indoor and outdoor dining 
capacity of  450. The Loft, a performance lounge and nightclub, 
will also feature a tapas bar.

weren’t kicking me out.
Surely Costco, the wholesale giant, 

would be more hostile toward a rogue 
photographer betraying trade secrets. 
This time I sought out employees as 
subjects to declare my presence. I went 
to the free sample booths on each aisle, 
making sure to take the treat before 
taking a picture. They were nothing but 
friendly; they would have given me the 
food regardless.

I shot a sandwich maker at Henry’s 
grocery store. He was more upset that 
he had to make one last sandwich 
before his shift ended. I tried different 
tactics to attract attention, like raising 
my camera over one of the aisles and 
shooting whoever was on the other 
side. But my subjects were only slightly 
alarmed. There were only a few cus-
tomers in the store, so I was more or 
less left alone to wander the stocked 
aisles. As I contemplated the morals 
of a society in which a dozen different 
types of hummus coexist on one gro-
cery shelf, I decided I had spent enough 
time on my pet project.

I wasn’t sure if I should be grateful 
that my camera is accepted more open-
ly than I thought or be disappointed 
that I didn’t produce the confrontation 
I  had admittedly hoped for. Satisfied 
or not, I can see now that most places 
don’t seem to care that much. That may 
mean that I’ll shoot more now that I 
feel free to do so, but it may just mean 
that I can no longer count on the allure 
of taking forbidden photographs while 
buying my groceries.

your body acclimating to the drugs 
and to the birth control, it’s a least a 
month-long process during which time 
you feel really uncomfortable. You’re 
putting your body through a roller 
coaster.”

The final step for the donor is the 
actual egg retrieval, conducted through 
a transvaginal technique involving an 
ultrasound-guided needle piercing the 
vaginal wall to reach the ovaries.

While a donor is reimbursed for all 
medical, travel and legal expenses that 
come with the procedure, she is also 
given monetary compensation for her 
involvement. While the ASRM rec-
ommends that a donor be paid the 
minimum amount of $4,000, the actual 
amount someone can receive depends 
on both the cost of living in an area, 
a person’s physical attributes and per-
sonal accomplishments and whether 
her eggs have successfully resulted in a 
pregnancy in the past. 

Erickson’s agency selects about 100 
donors each year, half of which are col-
lege students. Although she acknowl-

edges the large financial incentive 
involved in the procedure, she also 
feels college-aged women choose to be 
donors for philanthropic reasons.   

“In college you’re going through 
individual self-reflection and you 
decide that you want to do something 
to change the world,” Erickson said. 
“Personally, dealing with egg donors, 
people think it’s all for the money, 
but I really don’t see that as the case. 
These donors are wonderful girls who 
put their heart into it, they get excited 
when the couples they donate to get 
pregnant. If it were just for the money 
they wouldn’t care.”

However, Berliner believes it is 
deceiving to make egg donation seem 
like a process that’s a relationship based 
solely on good will and altruism.

“They’re specifically targeting a 
population of women who, no matter 
what their family background is or 
their economic background, are at a 
time when they need or want money, 
and don’t have a lot of time to make 
it because of their studies,” Berliner 
said. “In that sense it is a vulnerable 

population.”
According to Devereaux, ethi-

cal concerns arise when large sums of 
money are the incentive for procedures 
like egg donation.

“The issue of commodification and 
paying people is: At what point does the 
payment become coercive?” Devereaux 
said. “If I asked if a group of female 
undergraduates would be willing to do 
this, probably very few would. But if I 
said, ‘Well, the going rate is seven but 
I’ll pay 10,’ a few more might e-mail me 
afterward.”

No matter what reasons college-age 
women are donating, it’s the proce-
dures’ representation of information 
that matters, according to Berliner.

“I think that there just needs to be 
more information,” she said. “There 
needs to be more transparency about 
what this system is. [It is] something 
they should have full information about 
before they make that kind of deci-
sion.”

5 singles, ending Sullens’ career with 
a 6-1, 6-2 win, making Sullens’ record 
for the year 12-11 in singles, includ-

“It’s tough to end your career in

wish it would have gone better than 
the way it turned out. All credit to

Tritons, who have suffered a second-
round exit in the last three national 
tournaments. 

LaPlante sets another conference 
championship and a better run at the

G-Team Wins Tourney

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE
UCSD’s first-round wins in doubles play on May 3 helped earn the team a bid to Hawaii for the Division 
II national quarterfinals, where the Tritons could not  repeat their magic, losing 5-0 to BYU-Hawaii.

Whenever I witness the crown-ing of a new champion in any of the infinite sporting 
events I watch, I hear the valiant athletes 
talk of the incomparable feeling that 
their team was destined for greatness. 
In my short and limited athletic career, 
I have been relegated to second place 
many times. From losing in the bottom 
of the ninth in San Francisco’s Park 
& Recreation Bronco League baseball 
championship to seeing my Giants get 
within six outs of a World Series title 
and blow it, my sporting memory is 
filled with pain and heartbreak.

But on May 10 at Doyle Elementary 
School’s beautiful ball field, I began to 
experience the confidence that I’ve only 
seen in the likes of Jordan, Montana, 
Rice, Bonds and Gretzky. When the 
ragtag group of G-Team editors, pho-
tographers, writers and friends showed 
up to play the notorious party planners 

of the Bro team, they walked with a 
swagger that translated onto the field, 
where the G-Team broke a 5-5 tie with 
six runs in the final inning to walk away 
as champions following an 11-5 upset.

After some sloppy games in the 
earlier rounds of the inaugural tourna-
ment, the championship game featured 
some impeccable defense, even after 
some full team-roster boat races got 
both squads into the spirit of the sport.

Over the first few innings, both 
defenses stayed stingy, and both offens-
es could only muster five runs each. 
Despite the defense dominating to start 
the match, the keg was rapidly emptying 
thanks to plenty of disputes that needed 
drinkoffs to be settled and was almost 
cashed with the game still tied at five.

Since ties belong only in wussy sports, 
and we were playing America’s pastime 
— with a refreshing twist — the G-Team 
members called a motivational meeting 
and rallied around their semi-conscious 
leader, Charles-in-Charge, in order to get 
the winning runs across the plate.

After having two baserunners get 
tackled and tagged out just inches from 
home plate, the G-Team began prepar-
ing to resort to rougher tactics to get 
the go-ahead runs across. The winning 
rally began with a double into the gap, 
which was anywhere the Bros’ center-
fielder or shortstop wasn’t playing, and 
the runner came across to score as this 
reporter, playing the part of a decoy 
runner, took out the Bro catcher with a 
headlock on his way to the dusty turf.

Even after going ahead 6-5, the G-
Team maintained its focus on finding 
the gap and chugging as fast as possible 
in order to extend the lead. Another 
run came in on the next batter’s hit and 
three more scored on a weak fly ball off 
my bat that the Bro team inexplicably 
couldn’t catch. As I reached down to 
grab my warm, dark drink at second, I 
realized that with a 10-5 lead and only 
five cups left, one run would clinch the 
game and the tournament title.

My associate editor followed me in 
the lineup; the man that played varsity 
baseball back in our high school days 
growing up in San Francisco lined a 
hit through the right side that had me 

running full speed toward the beast 
manning the backstop. With an inevi-
table play at the plate, G-Team members 
roared out of the dugout to put the 
blocks on the Bro catcher, who miracu-
lously tore through three G-Teamers 
but could only grab my shirt, which was 
ripped to shreds as I crossed home plate 
to score the tournament-clinching run.

While this column may seem to 
glorify my role in this historic upset, I 
am only recounting a reliable version 
of what went down. And more impor-
tantly, I couldn’t be more proud of my 
teammates, who came together to win 
three straight games after the rest of 
the tournament field had counted us 
out in our first-round matchup with 
the skilled Marsupial team. As a sports 
editor who reads athlete quotes daily, I 
know how cliche this is, but it was truly 
a team effort. Every participant found a 
way to contribute, from the man playing 
through a torn hamstring to the beauti-
ful G-Team women who came out and 
played toe-to-toe with some of the best 
sloshballers this campus has ever seen.

As a senior ready to move on to 
greener pastures and a G-Team mem-
ber that has been on the wrong side 
of some of the most lopsided losses 
in sloshball history, I just hope this 
inaugural tournament will not be the 
last and that campus organizations will 
continue to square off next spring using 
the great sport of sloshball.

75 in Round 1 and a 76 in Round 2. 
“I missed a lot of opportunities in 
the first two rounds that could have 
really made a difference. But I’m 
still proud that I managed to hit the 
ball really well in the third round, 
but even then, the last few holes still 
ended up getting me.”

After playing his first 13 holes at 
-2, Phan ended with bogeys on two 
of his final five holes to end at even 
par. Cumulatively, his 223 finished 
at seven over par, which was good 
for 19th overall. 
In 25 rounds for 
the season, the 
junior led the 
team with a 75.6 
scoring average 
improving on 
that mark for the 
second consecu-
tive year. His best 
round of the year 
was a team-best 
69 at the Sonoma 
State Invitational 
in October. 

Head coach Mike Wydra sees 
Phan’s return as a senior as one of 
the key reasons why his team could 
be a threat next year.

“The strides Nathan has made 
throughout the season have been 
exciting to watch,” he said. “His 
work ethic is something the rest of 
our team should emulate.” 

Wydra’s ultimate goal is for next 
year’s team to return to nationals, 
a place UCSD hasn’t been since 
2004. During his 29 years as head 
coach, Wydra has led the Tritons to 
five second-place finishes and two 
third-place results. That national 
championship at the Division-II 
level still remains elusive for the 
veteran head coach.

 In 2008, Olsen proved to be the 
team’s workhorse, leading the team 

of the fifth inning would spot the 
Lumberjacks a lead that they would 
not relinquish. UCSD was able to 
put two runners on in the sixth 
inning thanks in part to the blinding 
sun that allowed a May pop-up to 
fall for a double, but Prescott again 
wiggled out of trouble unscathed.

The Lumberjacks added an 
insurance run in the bottom of the 
sixth inning on a delayed double 
steal that gave their pitcher some 
breathing room for the final frame. 
Prescott proved that the two-run 
cushion was not necessary as she 
made for a drama-free last inning 
and ended UCSD’s season by setting 
the Tritons down 1-2-3. 

Despite the early exit from the   
2008 postseason, Gerckens stressed 
just how much her team was able 
to accomplish while going against 
some of the top teams in the entire 
country.

“[After games like that] I tell 
the girls that I’m proud of them,” 
Gerckens said. “They had a great 
season, they worked hard and they 
played well. We’re in an elite group 
of teams that made it to the region-
als and it was a great experience that 
nobody can take away from them.” 

The painfully close games were 
perhaps the Tritons’ best-played 
contests of the year and epitomized 
how much the team had united 
throughout the season to overcome 
some early inconsistencies.

“We hit the ball better than we 
had been, we had decent defense, 
we believed in ourselves, and we 
had confidence in each other,” Lukk 
said. “We just couldn’t finish the job 
when we needed to. We came close, 
but couldn’t go far enough.”

After the tough losses, UCSD 
kept its regional-play in context by 
understanding just how difficult the 
road to the national championship 
game truly is.

 “We’ve done well in tournaments 

all year and our goal was to make 
the national tournament,” Gerckens 
said. “Unfortunately there is only 
one team in the country that gets to 
end its season happy, and that’s the 
team that wins the national champi-
onship. Especially with the amazing 

group of five seniors on this we 
would have liked to go farther.”

Although the season ended short 
of a trip to Houston, Texas for the 
NCAA National Championships, 
the Tritons can look back on the 
2008 campaign with complete pride

after winning 32 games, the second 
best mark since 2002.

“I wouldn’t have traded anything 
that we have done this year for what 
we got; we definitely were able to 
come together as a team,” Habib 
said. “We had our ups and downs 
but it was all part of the ride.”

For the departing seniors — 
Lukk, Ward, Maze, pitcher Nicole 
Fullerton and outfielder Randie 
Bundy — their final season in a 
UCSD jersey proved to be unforget-
table.

“We set our goals high and 
although we didn’t reach all of 
them, our accomplishments are 
something to be proud of,” Lukk 
said. “The 2008 team was great both 
on the field and off. The family we 
created left no dull moment, no day 
without a laugh, and an incredible 
amount of passion for this game. 
There are no other 17 girls I would 
have rather finished my softball 
career with.”

“There are no other 17 girls that I would have rather finished my softball career with.”
— Danielle Lukk,

senior second baseman

with 11 events played for a total of 
30 rounds. His 76.5 scoring average 
was second on the team, improving 
on the 76.7 he had during his soph-
omore year. His low round for the 
2007-08 season came at the Grand 
Canyon University Thunderbirds 
Invitational in Arizona at the end 
of March where he shot a second 
round 71. 

During the West Regional, Olsen 
finished at 225 (+9), which put 
him at 25th overall. Throughout the 
three-day event, Olsen managed to 

start strong, but 
eventually, like 
his teammate 
Phan, was done 
in by the difficult 
holes at the end 
of the course. 

The junior 
made birdies on 
three of his first 
10 holes, then 
stumbled by play-
ing the final four 
holes at +4. Even 
with the tough 

finish, Olsen should be another 
strong returner for the Tritons next 
season.

Phan and Olsen are part of a 
squad that loses no seniors, another 
reason to keep an eye on the men’s 
golf team next year. Wydra expects 
his developing team to make the 
necessary adjustments and improve-
ments to put the Tritons in the hunt 
for a national tournament. 

“One of my main goals as coach 
here is to lead this team to champi-
onships, and the first step toward 
winning a title is making it to the 
tournament,” he said. 

That’s sound advice from some-
one who’s been there before.

a Lumberjack error. At the top of 
the third inning, the Tritons again 
mounted a threat against Prescott but 
were unable to scratch across another 
run as an infield pop-up and a strike-
out left runners on first and third. 
Humboldt State finally came through 
with a clutch hit in the bottom of 
the fourth inning off of Ward, who 
was still able to limit the damage by 
stranding two Lumberjack runners to 
keep the game tied, 1-1.

SOFTBALL — The sports gods 
must have a cruel sense of humor. 
After unexpectedly losing their 
opening-round game of the 2008 
NCAA Division-II West Regional 
Championships on May 7, the Tritons 
could at least be satisfied with enter-
ing the elimination bracket thinking 
that doing so would keep them from 
playing top-ranked Humboldt State 
University, the only team to sweep 
the Tritons all season. As fate would 
have it, the Lumberjacks were upset 
in their first game as well, setting 
the stage for a sudden-death con-
test between the two teams. UCSD 
battled hard for seven full innings but 
was unable to topple Humboldt State, 
losing 3-1 and abruptly ending a suc-
cessful 2008 season.

“The girls played two really good 
games, unfortunately everything 
didn’t come together the way it need-
ed to,” head coach Patti Gerckens 
said. “On one day the offense was 
there and our defense was good but 
the pitching wasn’t were it normal-
ly is and the next day the pitching 
was phenomenal but we fell short 
on offense. We just couldn’t get it to 
come together.”

Although UCSD did not par-
ticipate in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championship, 
the team’s stellar play throughout the 
season earned it a fourth seed for 
regionals and pit them against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills in the open-

Tritons drop a pair of tight 
games at NCAA West 
Regionals to conference 
rival Lumberjacks, bringing 
32-win season to a close.

Senior third baseman Jenny Maze,  a 2008 Daktronics/CoSIDA All-West Region First Team honoree, went 2-5 with an RBI in her final  games in a UCSD jersey. 

ing round of the double-elimination 
tournament. The Tritons had won 
four-of-five regular-season games 
against the Toros and continued their 
dominance in the first inning when 
senior third baseman Jenny Maze 
lined an RBI single to center to score 
junior third baseman Jenni Habib. 

After two shutout innings, the 
Toros finally broke through against 
junior starter Lauren Chastain with 
a two-out rally to take back a 3-1 
lead. Senior left hander Melissa Ward 
entered to relieve Chastain and was 
able to eventually stop the bleeding 
by catching a Toro batter looking at a 
called third strike.

UCSD inched back in the bot-
tom of the fourth when sophomore 
shortstop Mandi Eliades smashed a 
one-hopper off the outstretched glove 
of the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
second baseman to score junior cen-
ter fielder Allison May and cut the 
lead to 3-2. The one-run deficit was 
as close as UCSD would get, as Cal 
State Dominguez Hills would score 
three late-inning runs to push its lead 
to 6-2. 

Senior second baseman Danielle 
Lukk showed the courage that helped 
define this year’s resilient squad when 
she stepped up to the plate with two 
down in the bottom of the sixth and 
deposited an inside fastball over the 
leftfield fence for her third homerun 
of the season. UCSD was able to score 
one more run in the seventh inning 
off an Eliades sac fly but left the tying 
runs on base for a final score of 6-4. 

For a team filled with veteran 
leaders, UCSD had no trouble main-
taining its composure after the loss 
and keeping its sights set on round 
two.

“After the opening round loss we 
were, of course, disappointed because 
we had expected and hoped to win 
four and move on,” Lukk said. “But 

we didn’t dwell on the loss, instead 
we focused our attention on the next 
game. Throughout the entire tourna-
ment, coach just kept reiterating the 
importance of enjoying every minute 
and just having fun.”

The second-round game matched 
two of the region’s best pitchers 
against each other as UCSD’s Ward, 
who became the schools all-time wins 
leader on April 20, faced Humboldt 
State’s All-American pitcher, Lizzy 
Prescott. 

“[Going against Humboldt State 
again] was a flashback to last year’s 
regionals when they sent us home,”  
Habib said. “We wanted to face them; 

we wanted to play them to even the 
score.”

Earlier in the season, Prescott  
handcuffed the Triton offense over 
four victorious games, yielding only 
four runs in 28 consecutively pitched 
innings. While each staff ace was 
accustomed to dominating their 
opposition, this game saw the pitch-
ers survive more on their Houdini-
like ability to escape tough jams and 
leave runners stranded.

The hot-hitting Lukk got 
UCSD on the board when she took 
a Prescott pitch the other way for 
an opposite-field double and came 
around to score on a stolen base and 

Tritons Can’t Get Past Undefeated Seasiders

For the third consequitive year a team from Hawaii, this time the BYU-Hawaii Seasiders, knocked the

GOLF — Juniors Nathan Phan and 
Billy Olsen, the two UCSD men’s 
golfers that qualified for the West 
Regional, ended their season with 
top-25 finishes at the Adobe Creek 
Golf Club in Petaluma, Calif. Phan 
and Olsen qualified for the indi-
vidual tournament as elite perform-
ers from the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament 
because UCSD didn’t qualify for 
the West Regional as a team. The 
pair of juniors had to win the indi-
vidual portion of the tournament to 
extend their season to the National 
Tournament in Houston on May 
14-17. Sonoma State won the team 
competition of the West Regional, 
clearing the field by 12 shots with 
a -3 total score and Ryan Sperry of 
Grand Canyon walked away with 
the individual title, earning a trip 
to nationals by one shot with a -5 
score.

“I really played well in my final 
round,” Phan said, referring to his 
even par final round 72, his best 
showing of the three rounds after a

JUNIORS GIVE 
UCSD REASON 

TO EXPECT 
RUN AT TITLE By Neil JoshiStaff Writer

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The No. 23 
Tritons saw their season end on May 
7 after falling to the undefeated and 
top-ranked Brigham Young University 
Hawaii Seasiders by a 5-0 score. 

Despite the lopsided score, coach 
Liz LaPlante came away from the loss 
excited for next year. 

“It was a great season,” she said. 
“With so many freshmen contributing 
to the team coming together so well, we 
can use this experience next season.” 

UCSD finished the season 14-
11, while BYU-Hawaii improved to 
26-0 and continued its quest for a 
third straight Division-II women’s 
tennis championship. Two seniors, 
Molly Sullens and captain Justine 
Ang Fonte, played their final matches 
as UCSD women’s tennis members. 
Both women finished solid careers for 
LaPlante: Sullens finished her career 
with a 27-14 singles record and 10-6 
doubles record while Fonte was 40-17 
in singles and 33-29 in doubles.

The Seasiders started fast in dou-
bles, setting the tone for their 26th 
straight win of the season. At No. 1 
doubles, Elwen Li and Maggie Deng 
took out UCSD’s freshmen combo of 
Taskeen Bains and Natalie Varnay by 
an 8-3 score. 

However, Bains and Varnay proved 
to be a formidable duo at the doubles 

spot, finishing the year 12-9. The two 
freshmen played 21 of the 25 matches 
at the top doubles position over the 
course of the year, an impressive feat for 
a pair of newcomers. 

 In the second doubles spot, Ramona 
Husaru and Becky Lu of BYU-Hawaii 
beat Kimmi Dao and Valerie Tang, 
another freshmen combo going on 12-
8 for the year. The duo went 11-8 at the 
second doubles spot and won their only 
contest at No. 3 doubles. 

Fonte and junior Ina Dan played 
third doubles for UCSD, and lost 8-4 
to Jenny Chin and Ayako Ikeda. It was 
Dan and Fonte’s first loss at number 
three doubles in four matches. Fonte’s 
career ended with victories in her last 
five singles matches and a 12-11 dou-
bles record for the year.

“There’s a lot of mixed emotions 
on your last match,” Fonte said. “You 
love to look back on all the wonder-
ful moments and the camaraderie you 
experienced with the team. There were 
a lot of freshmen who brought excite-
ment to practice and the matches, and 
I’m going to miss seeing them compete 
each and every day in practice.” 

After doubles concluded, the Tritons 
were in a position where they had to 
win five of the six singles matches to 
advance to the Sweet 16. Things didn’t 
go according to plan — they lost two 
matches quickly and were eliminated. 

BYU-Hawaii’s Deng soon 
extended UCSD’s deficit to 4-0 with 
a 6-1, 6-0 at No. 2 singles over Dalya 
Perelman, another freshman. 

Perelman saw time at the top three 
singles spots, going 8-13 for the year. She 
spent most of her time at No. 2 singles, 
where she went 7-8. The Seasiders 

UCSD uses tough play to 
make it into second round 
of NCAA D-II Nationals 
but falls short against  
top-ranked BYU-Hawaii.

obtaining employment and even a 
license to work in your chosen pro-
fession. My law practice prepares 
students with a criminal history to 
obtain a professional license and 
enter the job force with their best 
foot forward. We help students 
demonstrate their rehabilitation
