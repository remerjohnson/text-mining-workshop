Martin Luther King, Jr. 
must be remembered 

Though the University refused to recognize it ,,last 
Friday, January 14, was scheduled ~s a state hohday 
in memory of the only black Amer~can Nobel P~ce 
Prize winner Dr. Martin Luther Kmg, Jr. In tYPical 
UC fashion, 'the day passed without even a small 
notice from the Administration, 

Fortunately, the Black Students Union, a campus 
organization, held a march and rally by themselves, 
declaring a holiday of their own to honor a leader we 
should not forget, should not ignore, should not 
banish. 

Holidays at the University are not a matter of honor 
or deserved rest. They are recognized when they fit 
into the schedule of classe , and if students have 
already been awarded one holiday .in a quarter, then 
another will have to go. The same IS true of t.he ~taff, 
who would have to be paid for too much nothmg If we 
had more holidays around here.

Letters to the Editor 

Our holiday quota thi qua.rter is filled by the ~ost 
efficient President's Day, which marks thecombmed 
birthday recognition of Washington a':1d Linco~n . 
They were born in the same month, so their memones 
must also suffer. 

We have grown used to President 's Day. ~hose .two 
men died long ago, and have forever been wntten mto 
the history books. But Kin~ did .not die .s~ long. ag?, 
and with the current preSidential admmistratlOn s 
disconcerting and alarming. attitude t~~ard 
minorities we are in bad need of smcere recognitIOn of 
King's achievements. King and the memory of his 
goals cannot become a victim of troublesome 
scheduling of the UC system. 

Quality of education should count 
Editor: _ 

The University wants to 
increase student fees again. 
(Thanks to our el ec ted 
Gov e rnor Deukmaj ian 's 
budget cuts.) It is very easy to 
raise student fees. It is not 
easy to find revenue from 
other sources. I suppose they'll 
want some more money next 

Rutter w as " not ove rly 
concerned." He suggested tha t 
students s imply "dig deeper." 
After all , everyone must ha ve 
some resources to tap. UCSD 
Chancellor Atkinson admitted 
"there was potentia l for 
reduced a ccess" to our 
Univers ity , but "he was 

unsure how damaging high 
(ees would be." 

To me, the quality of an 
education and the students 
should count. I thought the 
college existed for the benefit 
of the students, not for the 
benefit of the college.

A crime withoutJ!unishment 

Molesters of small children 
go free much too often 

Berkeley's fight 
to stay un-chic 

By ROGER SIMON 
Los Anlleles Times Syndicate 

Jenn y is a beautiful child, all 
any parent cou ld hope for . 

At age 6, she is not , her 
mother admits, the neatest kid 
in the world , but she is 
cheerful and affectionate. She 
has a cat and a new puppy and 
has been careful to divide her 
time equally so the cat will nol 
sulk. 

Jenny likes a rt and sports 
and Is entertaining thought sof 
becoming ei lher a ba lleri na or 
a gym nast. She reserves the 
right to change her mind. 

lenn .... 's ml)thcl lovcs lwr 
vcry much. Wh ieh i~ why she 
blame.., herse lf so ven much 
for what happened to jenn). 

'Tm a fool," Jenny's mot her 
said. "Jus t a fool. When J think 
of wha t that s li me did." Her 
voice broke \ .... it h tears and 
fury. " When I thi nk about it , J 
just wa nt to. well. I'm a foo l. ·' 

She IS not. She is i ust a 
pa rent tryingtodothebc..,t shl' 
can. he \\ orks And therefore, 
at va rious times, ..,he mu~t f lOd 
people to 'ita\-' with Jenny. 

Not long age, she found the 
wrong person. 

He \ .... a<; th e rC'lali\c of a 
neighbor, a young man well 
li ked a round the apartment 
buildi ng where th ey live. 

"He wa' alway~ helpi ng 
people out ," Jenny's mother 
said. "He was al ways asking if 
he cou ld do the dishes or the 
laundry or take the dog ou t for 
a walk. Ill' was continuall ) 
U)ll1l1lg around." 

The aftermxm It happeO('(1. 
./('nl1) '" mother \\as gone fur 
ju.,t a fe\\ Illinutes. "A ll I d id 
was go 10 the qOf'e." "he said 
")t Isonh about threeminutes 
a 'Xii \. And w('lI. he was 
;Jrllund the apartment 
any\\'a y. The jerk was alwa y!-' 
around" 

So Jenny was IeI'I \\'It h the 
ma n, the man evervone liked. 

Abuu t a week la ter, t he story 
came out. Jenn y told her 
mother the man had done 
things to her. A modern child , 
Jenny knew all the correct 
words for the parts of her body 
and the parts of hi s bod y.

"I felt sick to my s tomach 
while she was telling me," 
Jenny's mother said . "£! was 
hard for her. I kept teJlingherI 
wasn't mad at her and it 
wasn't her faulLI told her that 
I loved her. " 

Jenny was taken to the 
hospital, where no permanent 
physical injuries were found. 
The psychological injuries will 
be more difficult to determine. 

The police were called . And 
the hospital did a hard , but 
correct thing. They refu'ied to 
allow Jenn y to go home with 
her mother. 

T hat IS because in many 
sex ual abu se ca~es, someone 
m the home IS the abu er. 
Twenty·fo u r hou r s later , 
however, after the hospital 
and police had Imest iga ted , 
Jenny was a llowed to return 
home. 

Two police officer'i came out 
to tal k to Jenn y. They brough t 
anatomical dolb with them to 
hel p Jenny tell her story. 

"The policemen \\ ere very, 
H'r~' good." Jenn y's mother 
said " I want pcople to knoW' 
that. Jenny rea llv likes them 
very much no\\. Th(' police did 
a good job." 

Jenn) 's attacker was 
arrested and i'l currently in 
jail, unable to make bond . He 

ha~ been Indicted on three 
coun t s of aru,rravated mdecent 

libe rlle~ \\it h achild , unlawful 
res t ra Int. deviate se xual 
assaul t and rape. 

Rut that I" not the end of the 
"tory. It IS, unfortunately,jus t 
the begi nnIng. 

eh tid nlolest('rs go free all 
the tllTle. )'Iudllo()of\ell, it is a 
cnme \\i1hout pUlllshment. 

ThaI i" because (he only

A Judge Illusl determine 
wherher thev know a tru th 
from a lie a nd realit y from 
fantasy. Some prosecutors 
don't like to bother with such 
cases. And many parents will 
not allow their small children 
to take the stand and face the 
horror of a brutal cross 
f'xamination .

" I've ~een full grown women 
who can't take it ," Nancy 
Martin , the prosecutor in 
Jenny's case, said. "I've seen 
them crack. I've had women 
who don't even want to tell me 
what happened, let alone say it 
in open·court. And in thi s case, 
we are talking about a 6-yea r-
old ." 

Acc ording t o Ma rtin . 
Jenn y's a t tacker has con-

key to the rase.

Parking places at UCSD: rare and at a prentiutn 
By JOHN BRICE Students, as mentioned above. 

You make the turn into the have 4391 spots to serve 4639 
last row and there is a parking permits. These numbers are as 
space being vacated. Twenty of Jan. 1 and are actually 2 
minutes of searching has paid "Is" lower than the present 
off and you. will make it to figures. 
c1as on tIme, or 0 you - Berkeley is the worst case of 
thought. The driver tells you · over-sell, according to 
that he promised the spot to a Ulmstead. "Up there they sell 
girl that soon pulls up in her twenty-five thousand permits. 
new VW. You are out of luck while providing only six 
and time. thousand spots. "The 

This situation may seem 
familIar If you are one of the 
nearly fh'e thousand UCSD 
students holding an S permit 
which give you the right to 
claim one of the4391 SparkIng 
spaces on the campus. This 
search is commonly known as 
an exercise in frustration . 

You should never find 
yourself in this position , 
according to UCSD parking 
office, assistant manager 
Claudia Wilde. who claims 
"there is never an hour where 
there are not at least fifty to 
one hundred spaces open. but 
they are,~n the distant lots like 
Warren. 

The fact that there are more 
permits sold than spaces 
available is a common practice 
according to the UCSD 
parking manager Robert 
Ulmstead. "Nowhere in the 
US IS the number of permits 
for parking equal to the 
parking spaces provided. Not 
everyone is on the same 
sched ule," said Ulmstead. 

UCSD ells 977 A permIts to 
faculty and gl\es them 6·17 
spaces and 2376 B permits to 
b7() \vith the 1430 spaces for the 
s taff \'.Ith B permits. 

students refer to the 
permit ,which are more 
expensive than UC D's, as 
"hunting licences." 

UCSD charges $7.50 a 
month for the student permits 
while the staff pay $11 a 
month and the faculty is hit up 
for $14 a month. As might be 
expected. the more expensive 
the permit, the better the 
location of the spaces. 

Our neighbors out a San 
Diego State University pay 
only $22.50 a semester for 
their parking permits, but the 
more than thirty 'thousand 
students must fight over only 
7500 spaces, according to their 
parking office. 

Mesa Junior College charges 
their s tudent $7.00 a month 
and ha 2257 spaces. As of la st 
Thursday they had sold 5500 
day and 3500 night permits 
but acccording to Robert 
Taylor. Security Manager at 
Mesa, these figures will more 
than double before the end of 
the current semister. 

UCSD does not sell night 
and day permits but they do 
take Into cons ideration the 
Idea behind it. Wilde 
commented tha 1 "a lot of 

people are only here part of the 
time and they don 't want to be 
told they can't have a permit. 
Ulstead claims that on any 
given day" everal hundred ·of 
the 12.000 people at UCSD will 
be away from campus for 
different reasons." 

M . Wilde feels that 
st udent could avoid a lot of 
unnece sary frustration by 
making themselves aware of 
just wha t spaces are for 
students. She added that this 

"Tickets generated 
about two hundred 
thousand dollars in 
fines during the 
1981-82 school 

" year. 

can be done by coming into the 
parking office, located behind 
the cashier and picking up a 
color coded map of the campus 
lots. 

"The parking crunch on this 
campus is nothing compared 
to the situation down at 
university hospital" said 
Ulmstead, adding that " their 
problem is three times as bad 
as ou rs." But it is his problem 
because his office oversees the 
parking at the hospital and at' 
Scripp!:o as well as UCSD. 
Parkers at the hospital many 
face a three mile bus ride after 
they park. They have [1R~ 

spaces but employees need 
three thousand alone. 

A multi-level parking 
facility will oon be built at the 
hospital wit h a projected cost 
of nine million dollars. This 
will create about 1100 new 
places but in reality only about 
500 spots will be generated 
'from this nine million dollar 
outlay. This i because 651 
places will be lost when leases 
are canceled on the distant 
lots. 

Ho pital parking rates now 
stand at $20 for the staff and 
$30 for the faculty . This will 
not come close to meeting the 
cost of the new lot. the U C 
Regents have stated that 
student money will pay some 
of the costs. Ulmstead said "it 
'is too early to say how much 
money will leave the campus 
for the hospital." 

"Students will be involved 
in the discussion~ pertaining 
to what money will go to meet 
the expense of the hospital 
lot." said Ulmstead. Currently 
six students s it on the 
advisory board of the Parking 
and Alternative transit office. 
the group also includes staff 
and faculty. Each college 
sends a rep but the AS has 
failed to send a rep to fill their 
spot this year. Kory Lover of 
Revelle, Nicole Howard at 
Muir, and Robert Brownlie 
from Third along with Judith 
Riffle who is on the board for 
the second year as the Warren 
rep. make up the st udent reps. 

A fIve year plan is being 
drawn up to meet the parking 
needs of [ TCSD. Ulmslead 

explains that although the 
peripheral lots are not fully 
employed at present there will 
be another lot. built near the 
present Warren lot. He also 
pointed out that the planned 
Em!inl'l'rinl! school mav be 
built on the Mandeville al the 
expense of a large amount of 
spaces in a lot that ha s 
recent Iy lost 20 st udent places 
and 51 faculty. Last year a bout 
three hundred student spob 
were created. Ulmstead also 
explained that all furture lot s 
will be on the campu edge as 
the closer land is protected. 
"One day we may use shuttle 
buses from lots." he said. 

Finding a parking space is 
only half of the commuter 
trouble at UCSD. Tickets. the 
more costly side of the issue. 
generated about two hundred 
thousand dollars in fines 
during the 1981-82 school year. 
Only half of this money from 
40.000 ticket s stayed on 
campus while half went to the 
city as a fee for collecting the 
fines. that is no longer the case 
and as of the first of this year 
all the money will belong to 
UCSD due to a change in state 
laws. 

Ulmstead explained that all 
the money generated through 
parking tickets must be u ed 
to de\elop and operate 
alternative means of student 
transportation. This is done 
through the parking office 
Free bu" passes for inter 
cam pus travel is one example

organized.

A rally and protest march for a nuclear-free future 

will take place at noon at Revelle Plaza. This is part of 
a statewide action on other VC campuses including a 
blockade of University Hall at Berkeley to protest 
VC's involvement with the nuclear weapons 
industry. 
_ The rally will consist of speakers and music with 
the march to the chancellor's office beginning at 1 pm 
led by the Reverend Kizu with demands that: * UC 
convert the nuclear weapons labs, Livermore and Los 
Alamos to peaceful purposes! * That there be no fee 
hikes! * That UC sever its ties with the nuclear 
industry and drop its military research for research to 
promote a peaceful society and healthy economy and 
making education affordable to all. 
Picket signs will be available for the march during the 
rally along with materials for you to make up your

UC creates center to curb nuclear conflicts 

By CANOLE tional security and coopera· 
tion by st ressing the kinds of 
acti\ Ities which can best be 
carned out by a unl\ersity. i.e. 
stimulate new research, 
support ongoing research, 
encourage innovation in 
teaching, coordinate the 
int erest of faculty and 
st udent s. establish links with 
experts outside the university, 
publish findings of research· 
ers, a nd conduct public 
conferences and workshops. 

The first of these workshops 
wi ll be held here at UCSD on 

together the Wide range of 
views and Intellectual 
resources with1l1 the uni"er' 

~:iIlY that it emphasl/e a 
multidlsciplmary approach to 
the problems under stud)'. The 
areas of 1I1qUlry WIll be 
mIlitary, economic, political 
and socIal. 

The IGee will study 
various Quest ions. including 
the following: 
- What are the elements of an 
effective nonproli feration 
authority and what can 
control. a change in its profile. 

What I., the relationship 
betVo.een economIc growth /· 
stagnation, emplovment and 
Inflation and arms '(ont rol and 
arms budgets? Can the world 
continue to use arm'> 
production as an economic 
tool? 

- What is the relationship 
between conventIOnal warfare 
and escalatIOn to nuclear 
warfare, political as well as 
technical? At what pomt does 
the warfare 111 the Middle·East 
or Indochina threaten world 
peace? 

commt:rCl al agreements be 
offered to prevent or dela y 
nU l lear proliferatIOn? 

- What IS the Impact of 
tcrrori..,m on the c,afet\ of 
nuclear facilities, on the u's(' of 
nuclear deVices , and ()n 
tnggerlng nuclear wnfhct 
inadvertent I ~ ? 

The California public's 
awareness of and imolvement 
in nuclear arms control 
reached a peak last November 
with the passing of the 
Nuclear Freeze Initiative. The 
result of this initiative was 
that then·Governor Jerry 
Brow n, r e prese nti ng the 
citizens of California. sent a 
letter to President Ronald 
Reagan asking for a freeze on 
nu c lea r armament and 
proliferation . For many 
Californians, Brown's letter 
expre sed the need for sensible 
international nuclea r policy 
see med to be the peace 
movement's last hope. But 
there is another. 

Institute of Global 

Perhaps the recc's most 
Important contnbution to the 
global community could be 
programs developed to 
reorient thinking about global 
problem.., and the pursUIt of 
peace in a way that transcends 
the East·West challenge and 
the mternal Umted States 
party politics. 

Hi toneall), . it cannot be 
denied there is a conflict 
between the lTnited Sta tes and 
the SovIets. But thiS conflict 
cannot be resolved through the 
threat (or in some cases the 
denial) of a nuclear holocaust. 
Nor can the po~sible 
mntinUlty of negotiations be 
disturbed by bendmg to the 
dictates of part~ politics Both 
the Rus 'ians and l T allie:- are 
sceptical and cautlou,- a bout 
slgnmg agreement" when U8 
attitude changes e\'t~ry four 
vear \\'It h the change of 
preSidents. 

While the Nuclear Freeze 
Initiative supporters were 
educating the public on the 
need for a nuclea r freeze, 
Brown and the University of 
California President David 
Saxon were preparing fo r the 
establi s hm ent of a new 
institute to meet the needs of 
this increased public concern 
and involvement. 

During 1982, the potential 
for nuclear conflict became the 
most pressing issue of the 
times. generating more public 
awarene s and involvement 
t ha n any other time since the 
Cuban ' Missle Crisis. The 
proliferatIOn and distribution 
of world energy resources and 
expandmg populations with 
limited food supplies may 
mmbine to create flash points 
of confrontation around the 
globe, thereby increasing the 
risk of nuclear confrontation.

to be ilulOnomou..; to pre"enp 
continuity in nuclear poIiClc".

12 The UCSD Guardian _ Monday, January 17, 1983 

Strap it on, flip the sW"itch, and get happy 
By DOUG HANAU 

Jf you were to walk along the 
beache in Southern Califor-
nia or, for that matler, 
anywhere in Southern 
California , you'd be surprised 
by the number of people who 
are wired into a radio or tape 
player, which is usually 
attached to the person's hipor 
held in place by a strap. This 
epIdemic, called "Walkman 
Fe\' er" IS cau s ing the 
"beautiful" people of this area, 
or as outsiders call it, "the 
Oi neyland by the Sea" to 
become more and more like the 
once remote wandering tribe 
that used to inhabit the barren 
stretches of coldest Asia. 
These people are quickly 
losing all their communication 
skills due to a li ttle box and a 
set of pint·sized earphones. 

"Hi, how va doing?" 
"WHAT?,( 
That's the new slang word 

in Southern California. 
Because of the fact that 
Southern California leads the 
nation when it comes to new 
phrases, it's a safe bet that 
soon the rest of this country 
will be creaming "WHAT?" 
Walk down Wall Street and 
you'll hear such catchy terms 
as "gnarly" and the ever 
popular "fer sure" with a 
sprinkling of " radical" th row n 
in for good measure, 

This really Isn't so bad 
because if you're smart, you 
won't have to deal with this 
type of person anyway. You 
see them WIth wIres hanging 
all over them like some sort of 
mutated television set and you 

realize that they are just doing 
whatever needs to be done in 
order to get through the task of 
staying physically fit. You 
have 10 wonder, however, 
what thei r brains have to say 
about all this. "Incoming song! 
Hit the deck!" 

This disease, God forbid , is 
spreading, At school, trying to 
walk to my next class and also 
trying to get a date: 

"Hi, how va doing?" 
" WHAT?,( 

tilt's enough to give 
a person an upset 
stomach. " 

" I saw you from across the 
plaza and I must tell you that 
you are the most beautiful girl 
to ever grace this fair planet." 

"WHAT?" 
''I'm running a sweepstakes 

and for a million dollars 
answer this question. What 
famous English band just 

finished their last US tour? 
Hint, a beer spon ored them." 

"WHAT?" 
"Close." 
It's enough to give a person 

an upset stomach. 
The real disracting part 

oomes when in class, in a very 
important lecture, the teacher' 
is stressing a point about 
supply side ramifications in 
the US if Porsche raises their 
prices for spare parts and 
afterward from the back of the 
lecture hall , you hear that now 
famous call "WHAP" Well , 1 
feel like walking, man, right 
up there and stringing the 
wired person from the nearest 
flagpole. These radios should 
be outlawed all across the 
country before all that is left 
are millions of little orange ear 
pads dangling from whatever 
object is high enough to hang a 
person from. The Ixxiies being 
taken down , of course, and 
ceremoniously dropped up 
along the beach so the jogging 
"walk people" will have 
somelxxiy to talk to since their 
communication ski ll s have 

regressed to the point where 
they, all due to the Walkman, 
wouldn't be able to tell the 
difference between a living or 
dead person anyway. 

Of course, the concept of the 
Walkman is not a new one but 
because of today's technology, 
it is now possible to creale 
such monsters . Thoma s 
Edison had the original idea 
for s uch a contraption when he 
first placed his ear next to his 
newly invented grammo-

"] feel like stringing 
the wired person 
from the nearest 
flagpole. " 
phone. "Gee, I wonder if I can 
put st raps on this?" With the 
invention of the telephone, or 
prehistoric Walkman, things 
really began to take off. In fact, 
it was Mr. Bell who first 
coined the slogan of today's 
"walk people" when at dinner 
time he was head to yell 

RECREATION 

"WHAT?" The most credit for 
this creation, however, must 
go to Private II , Ed Fone who 
decided one night. whi le on 
patrol in the steamingjungles 
of the Philippines that he 
wanted to listen to a little of 
the Andrews Sisters, who 
happened to be on a USO tour. 
So while hi s company trudged 
through the jungle, Private H. 
Ed Fone called Pearl to get a 
radio hookup, sawed his ear 
and mouth receiver in half, 
hung the exposed wire over his 
head, replaced the transmitter 
with another ear piece and 
proceeded to dance through 
the jungle li stening to the 
reall y peachy sounds of the 
Andrews Sisters. Of course he 
couldn't hear the] apanese and 
was captured by the most 
dreaded of all Japanese combat 
troops. He was captured by the 
legendary Samuri of the New 
Year, or SONY for short. They 
took him back to Hiroshima for 
interrogation but all they 
could get from Private H. Ed 
Fone was "WHAT?" The rest, 
of course, is history. 

Even today, there are people 
who would benefit from the 
use of a Walkman, The 
Washi ngton Press Corps 
comes to mind , I mean if I had 
to listen to president after 
president ta lk about how hi 
policies are worki ng or how 
economic recovery is just 
around the corner (it must be a 
big corner) day in and day out, 
1 too would invest in a 
Walkman . Talk show hosts 
would not look so bored 
anymore because th ey

Super Bowl ring remains elusive 
By PHI L LAU DER 

Sports Edi lor 
The better team won , 
That' s not always true in 

NFL playoff games, but it was 
yesterday w hen Miami 
defeated San Diego, 34-13, The 
Dolphins dominated the game 
in every way imaginable, and 
have now earned the right to 
host the AFC Championship 
Game next Sunday against the 
New York Jets, up et winners 
over the LA Raiders on 
Saturday. 

All week long the game was 
anticipated as The Sequel, 
The Shootout-Part II, The 
Rematch of the Century, etc. 
At the outset, the game did 
seem to be a copy of last year's 
41 -38 Chargers triumph in the 
Orange Bowl - but it was a 
copy in reverse, This time the 
DolphInS built the 24-0 lead , 
largely by taking ad vantage, 
as San Diego did las t year, of 
special tea ms opportunities -
namel}, two fumbled kickoff 
returns. 

Meanwhile, the match·up of 
Miami 's offense against the 
Chargers ' defense was not 
even cl ose , San Di ego's 
defensive line was blown away 
by Miami 's offen sive line, and 
it s secondary and Iinebacking 
crews were s hredd ed by 
quarterback David Woodley 
and friends. 

Thus, after riding an 
emotional high for most of the 
last two months, the Chargers 
fell flat for only the "econd 
time in eight games, But this 

on e count s . Miamt wtll 
proceed ; an Diego will watch, 
A fitting end to a bIzarre 
sea <;on , afte r which th e home 
team will again try to find the 
defense that has been the 
diff e. ence bet ween seco nd 
round playufb and super bowl 
victory. 

For consolation, San DIego 
fans, think about thi s: who 
really wanted a champIOnship 
with an asterisk next to it , 
anyway? 

Most of the city, [ suppose.

The story will take up one half of the hour iongprogram, 
and is an excellent chance for the UCSD community to

Cop' er Bowl VII: police a.re 7 for 7 
By MIKE TALLENT 

Garcia fades back, looks, throws complete to completed ~ pa s good for fifty yards to SDPD 
#13, Skip Stephenson - TOUCHDOWN!! receiver Mike Hurley. Two plays later Hurley 
"WHO 'S SKIP STEPHENSON?" ca ught a 29 yard pass to score another Heat 

touchdown. When the third quarter ended, the 
score was Heat 18, Mounties 7. While most normal people were busy listening to the Jets beat the Raiders, a mob-

well, almost a mob - was jammed inside San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to watch the 
famous Cop' er Bowl. The "County Mounties," 
or sheriffs, took on the "Heat," known better 
as the San Diego Police Department. 

It was a close match from the start when the 
SDPD took a sma ll 12-0 lead in the first 
quarter. A five yard TD pass from Heat QB 
Manny Garcia was complete to Stephenson. 
Later, with ten seconds left in the first quarter, 
Garcia found Jordan for a 10-yard completion 
and another "Heat" touchdown. 

In the second quarter, the s heriffs fought 
back when Rick Hendrickson s hot his way into 
the end zone for a Mounty touchdown . As the 
first half drew to a close, the Mounties had 
gained exactly 0 yards passing compared tothe 
Heat's ]]0 ("Hey, these guy, are good!"). 

The second half started off when Garcia 

As the fourth quarter started I sure was 
happy that the police were winning. The 
speedi ng ticket that a fun-loving sheriff gave 
me for doing 80·plus on the freeway got the 
best of me: My mood changed rather quickly, 
however, when the sheriffs scored two TO's in 
the final quarter. With onl y six minutes left to 
play, the sheriffs were winning 21-18. 

As the last three minutes ticked away the 
tension grew throughout the Stadium. Were 
the Mounties going to win for the firs t time? 
This was the 'eventh Cop'er Bowl , and they 
hadn't won yet. Too bad guys, Charles Lewis, 
running back for the SDPD, plunged in from 
the one to secure a 24-21 victory. 

After thegame a friend asked me what I liked 
best about the game. 1 replied with total 
honesty , "The firework s." But not all was lost , 
for the proceeds went to the Boys' and Girls' 
Clu bs Foundation.

take it. 1 just had a lut of 
opportunities." The only 
discrepan cy in Krau se's 
statement i that she doesn 't 
" have a lot of opportunities," 
she creates them herself. 
Whether that translates to an 
offensive rebound and tip-in 
for two, or a feed off the fast 
break, Krause always seems to 
be at the spot where it is most 
appropriate for her to be, Her 
fluent and graceful motion on 
the floor is ideal for the Triton 
running game, yet s he is able 
to rebound and find t he open 
player with an uncann y 
ability. 

Another Lady Triton whose 
talent is causinga few heads to 
turn is freshman Shelley 
McKeone. Although a backup 
for starli ng center Teik 
Francis, the six footer from 
San Diego is not exhibiting 
any of the tentativeness that 
might be expected from a first 
year player. In fact, it wa 
McKeone' s aggressiveness 
that shone greatly Saturday 
night. Malone could not ha"e 
asked for a more ste1l3r 
performance after McKeone 
ripped down 11 rebounds, 
rejected eight shots, and

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

Stall Writers 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Did the college 
basketball heirarchy lose their marbles? By taking advantage of 
the three point rule in the Allan Lic Coast Conference this oast 
Saturday, Virginia was able tocut a 24-point North Carolina lead 
with 10 minutes remaining to three with a minute to go. College 
hoop has become so popular in the last five years -with increased 
attendance, record TV and cable contracts and quality perform-
er - it has even outdrawn the NBA. The three-point shot is a 
farce in the NBA, only being used in the final two minutes of 
play. College basketball is so successful. why spoil it? Different 
conferences e\'en have dilierent rules (some have s hot clocks, 
some don't) . How they can allow a team to play wit h a three point 
circle and 45 second clock one I11gh! and not the next is oeyond 
us. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. After Nick Giaquinto of 
the Wa shington Redskins caught a pass 111 Saturday's playoff 
game against Minnesota , CBS commentator Hank Stram told 
this story. "He was honored by a local school which proclaimed it 
'Num ber 35 Day' (Giaquinto's jersey number). All the classroom 
doors had the number 35 on them, ham burgers sold for 35 cents 
in the cafeteria, and they even had exams in math throughout 
the day where every correct answer was 35." What Stram didn't 
tell u s was t hat twelve people in the 6th grade class failed the 
exam. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. We almost "blacked out" when 
we turned on the Raiders-Jets playoff game (last Saturday at 1 
pm) on NBC. The NFL's blackout rule which prohibits any city 
with in a 3()()-mile radius from viewing a contest if it has not been 
sold out 72 hours in advance, is a travesty of the worst kind . 
Thanks to the rule book, we were forced to consume our hot dogs 
& beer while viewing "Horror at 37,000 Feet Deep." 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Everyone has seen the 
com mercial where Rodney Dangerfield tells the wor ld how he 
get s no respect. Neither do the Was hington Redskins, and even 
Coach Joe Gibbs realizes it. So he called Dangerfield to ask him to 
ta lk to the Red skins players about it. Dangerfield was n't in so 
Gibbs left a message to call the Redskins' office when he was 
available. Dangerfield called the next day asking for Redskin 
coach Joe Gibson. 
COULDITBEDEPT. Dueto the enormouspopularitythat 
the UCSD Guardian sports sect ion has enjoyed for the last few 
months, The Los Angeles Times will announce later thIS week 
that starting January 3], the Guardiall sports section will be 
added to the Times sports page as a daily supplement (except 
Sunday}. Running Thoughts will appear, replacing Scott 
Ostler's column. Ostler wi ll continueto \\ork for the Timl'~. but 
v. til be reslxmsible for covering high ~l'h()()1 sports only.

TRITON SPORTS SHORTS 
MEN'S BASKETBALL - see full story on page 15 

UCSD's 64-55 win over Azusa Pacific last Friday night brought their season record to 
7-7, 2-1 in the conference. The team next challenges Southern California College 
Tuesday evening in Los Angeles. 

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL - see full story on page 16 
The Tritons are riding a four game winning streak following another 2-0 weekend_ 

UCSD humiliated La Verne on the road by the score of 103-61, and similarly drubbed 
Whittier at home, 75-40. The 11-7 squad now awaits the arrival of Claremont this 
Friday at 5 pm . 

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL -
UCSD's season started off on a good note Saturday when the Tritons took third place 

in the 10 team AII·Cal Tournament. After open pool play (the gameh were to II only, so 
they don't count on the season record), UCSD earned the right to meet UCLA 111 the 
semis. Although the Tritons lost , they did beat Davis to fil11sh behind UCLA and UCSB. 
Only the last two games count on their record, which is now 1-1. 

UCSD five plays hard and 
smart to preserve home win 
continued from page 15 
playing smart hard. " The 
second half much resem bled 
the firs t half as Azusa's Jeff 
Robin on and Jeff Apana hit 
baskets from the outside time 
after time, while UCSD. 
although playing far hort of 
their capabi li ties, remained 111 
the contest with the inside 
play of McGuire and Mark 
Barecca and the shooting of 
Hicks and Goodman. " We had 
a few defensive breakdowns 
and 18 turnovers is v,. ay too 
high," said Marshall. Those 
mistakes ~eem far less costlv 
with the \'icton, however. 
"We needed this ' win badl\," 
said Block. "[t was \en 
important for us to \\ 111 a-t 
home If we had lost thlt; one It 
would have been ver\' difficult 
for us to come back." 

Hicks led the Tritons m 
scori ng with 18 points, 
followed by Goodman with 15. 
" My s hot is in Tanzania," said 
Goodman, who is shootmgjust 
under 50 percent from the 
field. McGuire had \0 points, 
including two electrifying 
slam dunks. "Dave's gotten so 
emotionally involved lately , ' 
said Marshall. "He's become 
buoyant instead of Just bemg a 
stick." Mark Barecca 
contributed eight pomts and 
some solid defense to the \\'m 
E\ en though It was a 
squeaker, It may have been 
exactly \\ hat Block wantL'<I to 
see. " ... Ve don ' t want to peak 
yet . Wp \\ (lnt to pla\ well 
enough to get into the playoffs 
and then peak. "

sion. which was created by 
voters' in 1974; and $10.3 
million or 40 percent s lash in 
the Energy Commi ss ion. 
which wa formed by former 
Governor Edmund G. Brown 
after the 1973 oil embargo. 

The budget drew mixed 
reaction and criticism from 
San Diego's representatives in 
the State Legislature. 

Steve Peace . Democrat 
As emblyperson for the 80th 
dis trict. and Muir College 
graduate. refered to the budget 
proposal as "a myth . pure 
my th ." Peace added t hat. 
"Th is budget is a totally 
unrealistic document . its 
nothing more than a starti ng 
point. " 

Larry tirling. Republican 
A~semblyperson for the 77th 
District staled that "1 don't 
think we should rai !o.f' taxes," 
He opposed Senate Bill (SB) 
1750, the oil ~everance tax, but 
st ated that. " I could support 
some kind of tax increa e only 
If there are substantial 
compromises. " 

Stirling explained that 
would Include: "dumping the 
su per agencies; improving 
state investments; combining 
the UC with CSt!, thus saving 
abo ut 300 employees; 
abolishing both the '>tate and 
count \' Boards of EducatIOn; 
getting nd of the Coastal 
Commission staff ... " 

Bill Craven. Rf'publican 
State enator for the :18th 
Dlstnct. expre~sing a st ronger 

opinion than his colleague. 
stated that. " The budget 
proposed by the governor i 
not one that I necessarily 
favored , .. We should have set 
out to try to balance the budget 
by June 30. the fiscal year's 
end ," 

Student concerns were 
echoed when Mike Johnson. 
AS Pres ident at San Diego 
State University. s tated that 
the governor's actions " seem 
somewhat contradictory ... 
There is no way the system 
can absorb these cuts," He 
added tha t "While upset over 
fee inc reases , we're more 
worried about ensuring that 
furt her classes aren't cut." 

Dav id Goodman. llCSD 
Lobby Annex Director 
explained that. "I've made 
appointments to see represen· 
tati\'es Sunny l\1ojonnler and 
Larry Stirling ... We're going 
to speak to them and try to get 
across to them ho\'. worned we 
are ... We'regoingto usee\'ery 
political tactic that we can." 

One such tactic i~ an 
Awareness Rally, sponsored 
by the A lfCSD, to be held 
Monday. January 17, at noon 
on Revelle Plaza. Goodman 
explained that t here will be 
speakers. postcard wnting, 
phone calling, and a huge 
butcher paper banner that "we 
hope everyone "III sIgn at the 
rally and then send It to 
Governor Deukmejlan." 

Henrv Chu , AS President 
concurs that "This rally is 
important to sho'W c,uppori for 

how important education i 
and how dissatisfi ed we are 
about fee increases," He added 
" We'd like to ha ve some 
impact at thi s weckend 's 
Regent meeting," 

Chu further s tated that 
"Monday's rally is a precursor 
to the Student Lobby 's 
Political Action WeekOanuary 
24·28). when we plan to take 
part in the 'UC Phone Dome' 
campaign ." 

Jim Lofgren . s pokesperson 
for the UC Student Lobby. 
sta ted t hat " the 'UC Phone 
Dome ' program will g ive 
st udent an opportuni ty to 
voice opposition to increas ing 
fees and tell their legislators 
t hat they support increased 
taxes specifically supporting 
higher education," Lofgren 
added that. "phones will be 
provided on every campus 
\\Ith the numbers to call their 
representative'i, .. 

Linda Sabo. llC Student 
Regent and according to Chu, 
po 's ible speaker at Mondav's 
rally. stated that lobby efforts 
will insure that this "is an 
ongOing i<;sue. It will keep this 
$100 fee from not being an 
ongoing charge," 

Sabo added that "Legisla-
tors better receive full files -
baskets full of letters. from 
theJr constltutents saying 'We 
don't like this; we're not going 
to riot in the streets, but we 
want rou to know wc don't like 
thi'>, and we're going to pay 
attentIOn to how you support 
education' ...

only 18 minutes (YIelding to
