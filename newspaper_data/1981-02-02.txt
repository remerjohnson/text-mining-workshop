BY WILLIAM HAMILTON 

StaaWriter 

Gore Vidal, the controversial American 
r~ovelist, playright and social commentator, 
delivered a lecture entitled, "The Rebirth of 
the American Republic" last Tuesday n~t 
before a· capacity crowd in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

A flamboyant media figure reknowned 
for his personal feuds with novelists 
Norman Mailer and Truman Capote, 

Vidal's lecture was frequently punctuated 
with caustic wit and cynical overtones. His 
thesis, that the ills plaguing the natiOn are 
inherent in the basic structure of the 
American political sr.stem, led to a vitriolic 
dia~ribe against 'a structure which 
inhibits participation and which could 
benefit the electorate only if drastically

Humbled by a sweeping Silly 
Students slate election victory 
last sprinf' the more serious 
AS Counci members admit they 
are painfully aware of UCSD 
students' opinion of the job 
student government has been 
doinB here. 

With three months left to serve 
as a<krocates of UCSD students at 
large, AS members are taking a 
moment to define and overcome 
the PrOblems keeping them from 
doing' an effective job. 

Three possible explanations for 
the troubles that are plaguing the 
AS th~s year deserve investiga· 
tion ' - the almost universal 
inexperience of the Council, the 
dismal morale of AS members 
and the actual structure of AS 
government. 
. UCSD students voted into 

office last spring perhaps the 
greenest of student rep'resent-
atives in the university s history. 
Of 11 executive positions, only 
two, vice president and 
commissioner'of external affairs, 
were filled by students with 

previous AS experience, Bill 
Topkis and Warren Wheeler. And 
the epitome of inexperience was 
the President-elect himself, 
"silly" Jeremy Charlton, who 
won student support by 
campaigning in a bathrobe and 
party hat and claiming he was 
"potty trained .at ~e three." 

Aside from Topkls and Wheeler 
most Council members lacked 
practical experience in college 
government, student organiza-
tions or related bodies and were 
politically naive compared to the . 
slick politicos who dominated the 
AS last year. 

"The low carry-over from last 
year really hurts," says Topkis, 
who served as activity fee 
chairman last year and Muir 
College representative to the AS 
the year before. 

"It takes a lot of Ume to learn 
how to work within the system, 
handle budgetary mat.ters, deal 
with the administration and use 
your time effectively. Without" a 
strong background in these areas, 
it's hard to make progress on 

. important issues," he says . . 
Charlton's "silly" approach to 

student government, however, 
had a refreshing effect and 
seemed to make the Council's 
inexperience less important. The 
AS was more visible - Charlton 
could often be seen selling 
political bribes in his bathrobe on 
Rev~lle Plaza ; he followed 
through on a campaign promise to 
provide milk and cookies as well 
as beer at TGIFs and his spirit 

News analysis 

. appeared to arouse new Interest 
in student government here. 

And then he resigned. 
Most Council members who 

served with Charlton during the 
short time hew3" 'president (May 
14 to Sept. 25) agree that his 
resignatIOn threw the AS 
drastically off-course. 

Suddenly stripped of the "silly"-
leader who students had voted 
into office as evidence of their 
dissatisfaction with more serious 
AS officers, Council members 
became confused. Unsure about 
continuing in the rather vague, 
silly mode set by Charlton, yet 
fearful of criticism by UCSD 
. students if they adopted the 
serious orientation of old, AS 
members drifted through . ' the 
early weeks of fall quarter, their 
inexperience becoming increas-
ingly noticeable. 

Things onlr worsened for the 
Council, as 'silly" commission-
ers Meg Honda and Cindi Biondi 
submitted their resignations, 
folowed by those of Elections 
Commissioner Lee Anderson and 
Academic Affairs Commissioner 
Ernie Grijalva. By the first of 
November, only four AS officers 
remained in the posts to which 
they were elected, and Topkis, 
who took the rein when 
Charlton resigned , was worried. 

"Once one (council member) 
does it, the rest let go and give 
up," said Topkis in October. 
"Resignation is an easy, often 
appealing solution that a lot of 
people seem to be choosing," he 
said, adding that several other 
council members have indicated a 

plea e tum to pal 8 

'I' policy case 
delayed a week 
CEP won't act with 
students, press around 

. BY KATHY HUFFER 
EdltDr 

. A final decision on UCSD's Incomplete 
grading policy was held up Monday after a 
group of students refused to leave a closed 
Committee on Educational Policy meeting. 

Nine students, from the Guardia", the new 
indicator, the Associated Students and the 
Student Advocate Pl'OfP'am ignored CEP 
orders to leave the meeting, arguing that by 
law all university meetings must be open to 
the public and the press. 

CEP members debated the students' 
presence for Dver an hour before voting to 
uphold their policy of excluding whomever 
they wish from their meetings. 

But rather than forcibly evicting the 
students, the CEP continued with other 
business and tabled discussion on the 
controversial Incomplete grading policy until 
next Monday's meeting, which Chairman Lu 
leu Sham threatened to block with campus 
police. . 

A week earlier, the committee had expelled 
reporters from the Guardilln and new 
indicator on the grounds that the University 
of California is not bound by state laws 
mandating that state agency meetings be 
open to the public and press. 

The two newspapers, however, claim that 
UC is a state agency and is governed by all 
applicable laws 

One such law is the State Nrency Open 
Meeting Law, known as the Sagley Act, 
which stipulates that all non-confidential 
matters discussed at California state agency 
meetings ·must be open. 

While the Bagley Act specifically identifies 
the California State College system as bound 
by the law, it does not mention the University 
of California. 

UC General Counsel Donald Reidhaar has 
ruled that the law does not apply to the 
University, and that UC is not legally 
obligated to conduct open meetings. 

UCSD's Academic Senate Handbook states 
that, on the basis of Reidhaar's opinion, "it 
seems clear that the Academic Senate has the 
authority to establish rules about who may 
attend such meetings and who may be 
excluded." 

Academic Senate committee regulations 
restrict meetings to committee members, 
appointing non,voting student repre enta-
tives and invited gue t . 

Student present at Monday' meeting 
charged that this policy violate tate agency 
acces law and their Fir t Am ndment 
Right . 

Despite Monday ' action, Guardian and 
new indicator representative say they will 

.continue to challenge the policy. 
The challenge ha been upported by the 

American Civil Libertie Umon which ha 
agreed to defend the Guardia,,'s attendance 
at CEP meetings and inve tigate the

Are 'the Iranians the real barbarians? 
BY JOEL SWARTZMIU.ER 

They're finally back 
home ... but no thanks to an 
article printed by the Los 
Afflltks Times Oan. 6) and 
written by James J. 
Kilpatrick. The article, 
rfgal'ding the hostage crisis, 
was titled. "Time To Tell 
Iran: Free Theni Or Face 
War." This article was not 
only a bunch of hot air, it 
contained incorrect informa· 
tion pertaining to Thomas 
Jefferson and the Barbary 
States. 

He based the majority of 
his article on the fact that 
Ronald Reapn had ~rded 
the Iranians as "barbarians." 
The term was used here to 
desciibe the IrJllings in the 
recent pasl, and the 
treatment received by the 
host ... that were taken 13 
months before. But let's' go 
back to the 19505. Who was it 
that supported the Shah of 
Iran and the countless 
murders he committed? It 
was the CIA and the whole 
United Stares government. 
Iran is not more barbaric 
today than it ever was, it is 
just that we don't support 
their new government! As for 
the treatment of the 
hostages, it- seems a trivial 
retaliation for the treatment 
the Iranians received in the 
19505 and 60s. 

KilJ)8trick further stated 
that Carter had done all he 
could do in n~iating for the 

S"'(lrlz",mer, (I Milir 
sopllomort, ",role Ihis 10 
exfJras his I-'i"gs amc""i"l[ 
1M rao/Illion 01 the hoslage 
sitwation i" 1m". 

release of the hostages. The 
truth is, Carter did not do all 
that was possible. The first 
chance he had to release the 
hostages there were only 
three demands that had 'to be 
met: do not allow the Shah to 
enter the US', publicly 
apologize to the Iranians for 
supporting the Shah, write a 
promise stating that the US 
would no longer interfere 
with Iran's internal affairs. 
This was quite a small 
request, compared to the 
demand for $24 billion dollars 
asked for later. 

Kilpatrick also stated that 
it was now time to give Iran 
an ultimatum: release the 
hostages, or face war against 
the United States. Wouldn't 
war make us as barbaric as 

they? What about the 
sacrifice of the 52 hostages? 
He stated that part of the 
nation believed we should 
have used force long ago. We 
did! We attempted a rescue 
mission that took six months 
to prepare. All we got out of 
that was eight dead soldiers. 
But that wasn't good enough 
- Kilpatrick felt we should 
have blown them, and the 
hostages, off the face of the 
map, and send our apologies 
to the families of the 

host~s. How great of a 
world power are we that we 
can't admit a mistake, but 
instead, kill our citizens 
knowingly in cold blood? We, 
then, are the barbarians . 

Kilpatrick then used 
Thomas Jefferson's actions 

against the Barbary States as 
a parallel. He failed to show 
how different the time and 
circumstances were. The 
Barbary States were pirates, 
stealing from all nations. No 
trade in the Mediterranean 
was safe from 1550 to 1816. 
This looting was done for 
pure . economic gain, and 
needed to be stopped. In 1795, 
the United States' began 
paying large sums of money 
to the Barbary States for 
protection against this 
piracy. This lasted for five 
years, not tiften as Kilpatrick 
mentioned, but the looting 
kept on. In lS01, when 
Thomas Jefferson took office 
he saw this double piracy and 
fought against them. This 
lasted until 1815, not ]S05 as 

Kilpatrick stated, when the 
Barbary rulers promised to 
stop the acts of piracy against 
the ships from the United 
States. Because the United 
States supported the Shah, 
the Iranians have a grievance 
against us, and are doing 
what they feel is fair to regain 
what belongs to them. ' 

As a syndicated writer, 
James Kilpatrick has an 
obligation to his readers, 
regardless of the freedom of 
the press. His article lacked 
in the spirit that the United 
States needed to hear, then. 
He should have shown more 
care toward those who have 
waited so long to . see the 
hostages freed, including the 
families of the hostages. 
Besides his heartlessness, his 
misinformation about 
Thomas Jefferson's war 
attempts ' showed a bit of 

thoughtles~ness, too. A man 
of his caliber should spend 
more time researching "'is 
facts, especially if he wants 
to use them to put us into 
war. 

Ultimatums are a sign of 
weakness, not in the sense of 
the military, but in the sense 
of peaceful, foreign relations. 
Although Carter was not as 
fast as pc!ople might .have 
hoped, he has finally gotten 
the release of the American 
hostages. If the ultimatum 
had been delivered, it would 
have resulted in the deaths of 
many humans - Americans 
and Iranians alike. Though 
possibly a disappoitment to 
Kilpatrick, no lives were 
taken, and peace may be 
re$tored between ' natIons.

Words of Third World are not 'rhetorical' 
Editor: 

"Racist," "labels," 
"phon y," "garbage," 
"segregationist" and 
"rhetoric" have all been 
terms used recently in two 
separate letters written to 
the Guardian. A phantom 
writer and Ralph Rainwater 
Jr. have totally distorted the 
focus of my letter (Guardian, 
Jan. 19). Both have illustrated 
that they are against using 
Third World Unity as a viable 
political strategy to combat 

the problem of declining 
numbers of people of color at 
UCSD. I can understand this 
- they have only demon· 
strated on a small scale the 
popular thoughts of domi-
nant society, thoughts which 
will manifest themselves if 
Brown, Black, Red, Filipino 
and Asian people unite in 
struggle to demand justice 
from this racist, sexist and 
capitalist society . which 
governs us. 

It has always fascinated

me that when we as people of 
color attempt to expose the 
injustices that affect our 
lives, so'meqne always comes 
to the defense of the status 
quo and distorts what we 
believe. It's time that people 
face 'facts and stop trying to 
assassinate our history, 
beliefs and slru~It:S. All the 
above term!; should be 
replaced by positive ones: 
racism with race conscious-
ness; labels with self -
determination; phony with 
reality; garbage with political 
strength; and rhetoric with 
historical documentation , of 
our respective people 's 
struggles in the United 
States . Only then will people 
grasp t he true meaning of our 
struggles to liberate 
ourselves from the oppres-
sive and unjust conditions in 
which we live. And before 
anyone says, "If you don't 
like it here, why don't you go 
back where you came from," 
let me say that our people 
(Chicanos and Mexicanos) 
have always been here and 
we mean to stay. 

Finaliy, for those who are 
interested about Third World 
alliances, the Teacher. Dr. 
Maulana Karenga, defined 
the Third World by three 
basic characteristic : color, 
condition, and self·conscious 
practice. 

-Color: people of color as 
opposed to the colorless; 
people denied and deformed 
In their history and 
humanity by racis t and 
capitalist exploitation and 
oppr-ession. 

- Condition: The " have-

nots" as opposed to the 
"haves." Europe and her 
descendants brutally 
appropriated the human and 
material resources of people 
'of color and thus placed them 
in the conditions of artificial 
"have·nots," i.e. people with 
wealth they cannot use for 
their own benefit. 

-Self-conscious practiCe: 
Self·conscious practice 
evolved from self·defensive 
and self-developmental 
action against racist/capital -
ist exploitation and oppres· 
sion . It is revolutionary in 
that it seeks ttl reverse the ' 
established order, to take 
back through struggle 
control of each people's 
destiny and daily lives and 
reshape their wotld in their 
own image and interest. 

The Teacher goes further 
to state that one of the bases 
for unity is situational 
similarity - people oppres-
sed on the basis of race and 
color. Karenga says that 
unity would accomplish the' 
following: 

1) increase strength and. 
possibilities for 'struggl~ and 
victory; • 

2) lessen the possibility of 
each groUp betng mantpu· 
lated lly the ruling groups 
against each other; 

3) lessen negative inter-
group rivalry and conflict; 

4) lay the beginning basis 
for a new society and world of 
mutual respect and coopera ~ 
tion among the majority of 
humankind. 

There is much more to this 
revolutionary and difficult 
theory , but the meaniflR 

behind it is what I direct 
myself toward_ If any of you 
are interested in it there are 
people here at UCSD that can 
assist you in further 
research. 

In conclusion, it's fair to 
say that Third World Unity 
~s a viable political strategy _ 
IS real and not a phony flag of 
unity. It is necessary to take 

. us seriously, given the 
current conditions which we 
face in the SO's_

Women's 
Rights 

We are in the middle of a 
period of social change in which 
the concept of the female role is 
changing radically. The increase in 
new alternatives also brings along 
with it much confusion for 
women students who have 
traditionally been socialized to 
consider marriage and family 
roles as being of primary 
importance. As a result, women's 
centers have been created on 
campuses across the country as 
an effort to deal with the speCial 
needs brought up by these 
changes. We of the Women's 
Center Collective are firmly 
convinced that UCSD needs our 
Women's Center to help deal with 
the special needs of women on 
this c~mpus. We are committed 
to changing the present 
conditions that are oppressive to 
women, and want to help women 
develop themselves in ways that 
society does not encourage or 
assist 

We urge you to take a stand on 
issues facing women in the 80's 
and support women's rights. Get 
involved in our programs aimed at 
educating women about their 
present condition in society and 
how to change it It's obvious 
though, that we can't keep the 
Women's Center going this year 
without all of your help. We want 
you to use the Center for your own 
needs, whatf!).ler they may be. If 
you need information for your 
personal use or for academic 
researCh, if you want to get 
iriv'olved in the workings of the 
Center and gain valuable work 
experience, or just (and 
especially) if you need a 
comfortable place to relax and 
talk with other women in a 
supportive environment, the 
Women's Center is here for you. 
We're next door to the Food Co-
op in the Student Center and our 
phone number is 452-2023. Drop 
in and share your ideas with us.

...... From left to right: CEP member Ronald Langaker shows his weariness 
during the debate Monday evening that lasted over an hour on whether to 
exclude the press from the meeting; center, Chairman Lu Jeu Sham, who 

wanted the meeting closed, leans back while running the show; at right, 
Michael Parrish, the only professor who voted to allow students and press 
to attend the meeting. 

'I' policy case delayed one week 
CEP won't act with students, pres~ watching them 

continued from page 1 
Academic Senate policy. 

The National Lawyer's 
Guild, too. is involved with 
the issue, and has agreed to 
defend the new indicator's 
right to attend the meetings, 
according to ni member Jon · 
Bekken. 

Both student newspapers 
plan to send reporters to next 
Monday's CEP meeting. If 
the reporters or any other 

. uninvited students refuse 
orders to leave the meeting. 
they could face university 
disciplinary action or even 
arrest. 

In a recent interview with 
the Guardian, Reidhaar 
supported CEP's right to 
expel uninvited observers 
from th~ir meetings. 

Reidhaar says there is "no 
question" that the Universi-
ty of California is not legally 
recognized as a state agency. 

And while UC is "an 
instrumentality of the state." 
it has "unique and special 
status" with the state which 
exempts it from state 
constitutional or legislative 
rules. he says. 

"The state college system 
doesn't have constitutional 
independence," and as a 
result is bound by such laws 
as the Bagley Act, he adds. 

However, ACLU attorney 
Martin McGuinn says UC is a 
public agency and is bound by 
any applicable laws. 

CEP members at Monday's 
meeting were unclear of their 
rights to exclude the press 

and public. but voted against 
opening their meeting based 
upon Reidhaar's interpreta-
tion of ' UC's status as non-
state agency. 

Members also argued that 
they feel restrained from 
speaking honestly and openly 
on policy matters in the 
gresence of reporters and 
photographers . 

"It's difficult to keep an 
even keel when cameras are 
c1icki~ and people are taking 
notes.' commented commit-
tEe member Ronald Lang-
acker. _ 

"We make sure notbing we 
do is tf0ing to screw a 
student, he argued. "We try 
our darndest to treat

or not to make UCSD's 
Incomplete grading policy 
more rigid by prohibiting

assigning grades to students 
whose Incompletes are not 
made up in one quarter. 

Because a tightening of the 
policy could affect hundreds 
of undergraduates who have 
allowed their Incompletes to 
lapse beyond one quarter. the 
matter has become a 
controversial student issue. 
\.The Associated Students 

aj}proved a resolution 
indicating their strong 
opposition to the proposed 
tightening of the Incomplete ' 
grading policy at tbeir 
Council meeting last week. 

Council members were 
almost unanimous in their 
wish to give students "at 
least 13 months to make up 
an Incomplete." At the end of 
that time. AS members 
believe students should be 

giv~n _ "no ~edit," not a

And AS Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs Lee 
Anderson. unanimously 
appointed to the post by the 
Council last night, plans to 
"make fighting the Incom-
plete issue (his) top priority."

consumer applications of 
energy conservation meas-
ures, as well as fostering 
significant educa~lonal and 
research efforts here. 

The energy program began 
operation in the 1972 
academic year with univer-
sity support for two research 
assistants . The Energy 
Center was established as a 
re earch unit in June 1974 to 
take advantage of the 
oportunitie that exist in San 
Diego to solve fundamental 
problems resulting from the 
interrelated physical, bio-
logical, economic, political 
and social consequences of 
the world's need for energy. 

The Energy. Center at 
UCSD has received a 
continuation grant of $82,000 
from the San Diego Gas and 
Electric Company for sLudies 
in energy conservation. 

Aa:ording to Stanford S. 
Penner, professor of 
engineering physics and 
director of the Center, the 
money, together 'with 
previously uncommitted 
resources, will be used for 

continuation or intitiation of 
studies dealing with energy 
conservation. 

The studies will include 
the use of wall and floor 
insulation in reducing 
residential energy consump-
tion in San Dieg County; air 
infiltration, its control and 
its. effects on residential 
energy requirements; and the 
use of passive and active 
solar energy technlogies in 

San Di~o County. 
Also IOcluded will be a 

study of chemical energy 
storage systems, especially 
those that may be used in 
conjunction with solar 
energy applications; and the 
development of improved 
underground electrical 
transmission lines. 

The work will be conduc-

AS in sluDlp \Vith Inorale,

continued from page 1 
desire to "jump off." 

AS college representatives 
Eddie Vijil, Marcia Vdovin, 
Laurie Allen and Diane 
Foster have all resigned since 
then. 

The large turnover in AS 
membership made it more 
and more difficult for the 
Council to defend itself in 
face of increasingly harsh 
criticism from students, 
faculty and administr!lt.io!l' 

With new students Jommg 
the AS frequently and old 
members moving up to fill 
vacated posts that were not 
ideally suited to them, the

down to work on projects and 

. issues at hand, 
"This Council has had to 

spend so much time and 
energy organizing and 
cleaning up our own house, 
we've had trouble doing 
anything constructive," says 
Topkis.

But Vice President Warren 
Wheeler, originally elected 
commissioner of external

a lack of time to do the job.

"Last spring, the students 
here made very clear their 
dissatisfaction with people 
taking student government 
seriously," says Wheeler, 

"The people in office now 
have to deal with that 
rejection. It's very inhibiting, 
and makes you very self· 
conscious about your 
perfonnance. "

GENERAL FOODS INTERNATIONAL COFFEES 

Along with AS Commis-
sioner of Student Welfare 
Reggie Williams, Wheeler 
believes the problems 
hampering the AS this year 
are due more to a structural 
defect in the government 
than to low morale or 
inexperience. 

"We need a big change in 
the selection of representa' 
tives to serve on the Council, 
because the AS just isn't 
doing the job I know it can," 
says Wheeler, 

Wheeler is designing a new 
AS constitution that, among 
other things, stipulates the 
selection of AS representa-
tives according to their major 
here, not by college as is the 
current procedure_ 

"It's clear that the most 
important thing to most 
UCSD students is their 
education" Wheeler says, 
adding that "people feel more 
of an affinity towards 
individuals in their own 
major than those in their 
college." 

Electing representatives 
by major, Wheeler believes, 
"would facilitate much 
greater interaction in student 
government here. Represent· 
atives would see students 
they are serving in their 
classes, ahd would have a 
reason for talking to them on 
!l basis separate from the 
'\S. " 

Although the figures are 
still tentative, Wheeler's 
constitution would call for 
two representatives for every 
100 students in a given 
major, the maximum number 
being six. BioloJY, for 
example, a major WIth 1,890 
students, would get six 
rep'resentatives, while 
phIlosophy majors, 51 in all, 
would Ret one. 

San Diego State operates 
its AS on a similar system, 
electing one representative 
for every 1,500 students in a 
given school of study. SDSU, 

plea. e tum to pale 9 

Thursday, Feb~ary 5, 1981 

continued from page 8 
however, has set no ceiling on 
the number of representa-
tives a school sends to the AS. 

Wheeler's constitution and 
one recently completed by 
Wi lliams are bicameral 
systems. 

One group, called the 
Council and consisting of the 
representative chosen by 
major under Wheeler's plan, 
handles the legislative 
branch of the AS, such as 
funding student organiza-
tions. 
, The second body is 
composed of the elected 
commissioners, who Wheeler 

. has "divorced from the 
weekly decision-making 
process so that they can 
spend more time working in 
their respective areas, such 
as academic or external 
affairs." 

Rounding out the AS under 
Wheeler's structure are four 
committees - Rules , 
Finance, Academic Review 
and Administrative Liason -
ro which four representatives 
from each college will be 
appointed, 

The Guardian 

AS staggers through 80-81 
Williams' constitUtion, 

Wr'itten because he feels the 
AS is currently "hierarchical 
and alienates students," 
divides the AS into a General 
Council and a Cabinet. The 
General Council membership 
consists of four college 
representatives, a women's 
representative, a Third 
World respresentative, a 
cooperative representative 

. and two students at large. 
Like Wheeler's Council, 

the General Council assumes 
full legislative responsibility 
for the AS. . 

The Cabinet, made up of 
six commissioners elected at 
large plus a non-voting 
representative from the 
General Council, "allows the 
commissioners to concentra-
te on issues, not the daily 
administrative taskS they 
must now perform," says 
Williams. 
. One unique feature of 
Williams' structural plan is a 
provision that ~ves voting 

priveleges to any student 
who provides proof of 
attendance at two previous 
General Council meetings. 
This liberty does not apply, 
however, on budget and 
appointment matters. 

This clause, reminiscent of 
the ill-fated Student 
Cooperative Union (the "Co-
op") which died in 1976, has 
drawn sharp criticism from 
other AS officials. 

"The ideal behind this is 
good, as it encourages a town· 
nail meet.ing type of 
structure," says Student 
Body Presidents Council 
ChaIrwoman Linda Sabo of 
UCSD. 

"But it assumes that a 
wide representation of people 
will show up at the meetings, 
study the issues and vote. 
That's too big an assump-
tion," she adds. 

Sabo, like Topkis and 
Wheeler, fears that sPecial 
interest groups would pack 
meetings and vote to allot 

funds or approve bills that 
would directly benefit them. 
A similar fate befell the Co-
op. 
. "That Jcind of small group 
control is even less 
representative than the 
structure we have now," 
Topkis says. 

Williams, however, 
believes "if students have the 
drive to mobilize for three 
meetings, their votes should 
be counted." 

Another structural change 
- the elimination of the vice

Topkis, who is graduating 
in June and would not bee 
affected by the new 
constitution, thinks it's more 
than the need for "a 
spokesperson. " 

"There are certain actions 
the AS makes that someone, 
the president, has to take-
responsibility for," he says. 

But AS Advisor Randy 
Woodard, while admitting 
"it's ~ to have a person 
recogniied by s~udents,

the president is "really just a

strong opposition.

~~~~~~~~~~~----------------------------

Gore Vidal on the State of the Union 
Author's talk is cynical, witty 

continued from page 1 
modified." 

Vidal hotly criticized the 
tw o- party sys tem a s 
ineffectual, suggesting the 
implementation of a coalition 
form of government as an 
alternative, and recommend-
ed that politica candidates be 
prohibited from buying "one 
llJinute of time on television 
or radio." 

"Politicians should provide 
to voters information which 
lias been held from them. In 
other countries, voters vote 
along party lines on the 
basics of proposed policies 
rather than for personali-
ties," he said. 

Indeed, Vidal 's plan for 
revising the American 
political system calls for a 
st udy of comparative 
government. He blamed 
America's low voter turnout 
on a failure to adopt a truly 
represen tat i ve form of 
democratic government, 
such as is found in West 
Gernmany or Sweden. "We 
should try participatory 
democracy for a change," he 
said. 

"The United States is not a 
democracy, but ratht:r an 
oligarchical Republic. The 
root of the problems facing us 
is the basic structure of the 
Constitution. Much of the 
wording of the Constitution 
is ambiguous, especially 
Jefferson's 'pursuit of 
happiness clause,' which is 
as loony a goal as has ever 
been stated on an important 
document. The Zodiac killer 
could have ' argued such a 
provision in his own' 
defense," Vidal argued. 

Vidal blames constitution-
al provisions for permitting 

the very dictatorship of the 
chief executive that it 
ostensibly exists to protect us 
from. 

"The President has the 
power to do anything he . 
wants, and an executive 
order is essentially equival-
ent to an act of Congress. In 
fact , netiher Congress nor 
the Supreme Court has never 
once overruled such an 

executive order." Vidal 
would rest ructure the 
current executive branch so 
that the presidency would be 
a ceremonial position. 

The Supreme Court, which 
Vidal claims has become "a 
legislative body," would have 
the scope of its authority and 
powers restricted substant-
ially, under his proposed 
revis ions . A popularly-
elected legislature. which 
currently cannot exercise 
"even sufficient power to 
invt:SLigate or control the 
CIA ," would formulate 
actual policy and, in effect. be 
the governing organ. 

One reason for internal 
societal problems is the 
historical track record of "the 
state as legislator of morality. 

"American policy has been 
formulated by lawyers , 
which is its biggest problem. 
The crime epidemic is a 
result of too many laws 
which lead to lawlessness," 
he said. 

Vidal sug~ests the 
reshaping of 'a grown-up

society" through the 
abolition of laws which 
penalize perpitrators of 
"victimless crimes such as 
drug use, gambling and 
prostitution, thereby freeing 
the police from 70 percent of 
their work, (enforcement of 
"victimless crime" laws) so 
that they can take care of us 
- and themselves_" 

He wryly noted that the 
saving accured from such 
decriminal ization measures 
could ease s6me of our 
domestic economic woes_ "It 
costs $4 billion annually to 
imprison three million 
people. This is roughly what 
it would cost to send them all 
to Harvard for a year, where 
at least they could learn how 
not to get caught." 

There were several points 
of audible audience disagree-
ment with Vidal's remarks 
during the lecture. Among 
these was a strong reaction to 
Vidal's statement that, 
" ... the basis of inflation .. .in 
one sentence, is armaments," 
and that the American 
economy "thrives on the 
preparation for. war while 
avoiding actual conflict." 

Vidal stated that the 
Vietnam War "wrecKed our 
economy by causing former 
Presidents Johnson and 
Nixon to authorize the 
printing of more money." He 
added that the conspiracy in 
government to spend one 
fourth of the federal budget 
on military expenditures, lor 
which "congressrntJl r~ve 
a commission from the 
military" contributes to the 
perpetuation of "a federal 
budget which can never be 
balanced as things are, with 
the government printing up

money to borrow it and 
buyint{ up the money to pay' 
for it. -

Vidal suggested that the 
restructuring of the 
American political system 
might be affected, using the 
British Parliamentary 
system as a possible 
archetype. Noting that "since 
World War II, not one newly-
Greated nation has emulated 
or adopted the political 
system of the United States." 
Vidal equated O\lr declining 
status to a growing 
international awareness that

Rollins and Coryell 
share go.od moments 

BY SID CORBETT 
Don't Ask-Sonny Rollins, with Larry 
Coryell (Milestone) 

The name of Sonny Rollins calls to mind 
many of the greatest modem jazz artists, 
such as Miles, Ornette Coleman, Monk, Cecil 
Taylor and many others who have a 
rebellious curiosity that is the spark and 
catalyst of brilliant improvisation. That is a 
trait that saxophonist Rollins has as well. 

Rollins' forte is tone that is full and 
senuous. Like the best jazz pioneers, Rollins 
has always felt the need to expand and 
explore different avenues. And so it was with 
great anticipation that I listened to his recent 
release, Don 't Ask, on which he teams with 
guitarist Larry Coryell. 

The idea of having Rollins team up with 
Coryell sounded like a great idea, an idea 
which anticipated Rollins' straight-ahead 
approach, steeped in the blues and be-bop 
tradition, meshing with Coryell's unique and 
pioneering blend of hard-rock galvin ism and 
the rapid-action technique of jazz. Don" Ask, 
however, falls short of its potential greatness, 
though there are some superb moments. 

"The File" and "My Ideal," a pair of duets 
for sax and acoustic guitar, highlight some 
beautiful work by Coryell, particularly on the 
latter track where he combines cascading 
.Jines and some near-classical chord voicings. 
Rollins himself blows some mean changes on 
tbese duets, as well as on the title track,

Film soundtrack fantasy 
strange though affecting 

BY BARRY ALFONSO 
Popeye (Original Soundtrack-Boardwalk 
Records) 

Robert Altman's film .:daptation of Pqpeye 
has received some decidedly mixed reviews, 
but even skimrier praise has been han¢ed out 
to the movie s music score, composed by 
Harry Nilsson . Reader critic Duncan 
Shepherd, for instance, commented nof long 
ago that the Popeye soundtrack album wOJlld 
make the ideal Christmas gift - for an 
enemy. In sum, reviewers have called the 
film's songs flimsy, annoying and out-of-
place. 

I must confess that I haven't seen Popeye 
yet (all those Moms and Dad~ and kids 
waiting in line at the UTC Slxplex, you 
know), and I understand that the songs in the 
movie aren't identical to the ones on the 
record. Still , I'd like to offer a defense -or at 
least some sympathetic remarks - about the 
Papejt suundtrack LP as a collection of songs 
to be appreciated on their own merits. 

The soundtrack marks the first album of 
new material by Harry Nilsson to appear in 
this country since 1977 (last year s Flash 
Harry LP was only released overseas). While 
cast members Robin Williams, SheJley DuvaJl 
and assorted others handle the singing on the 
record, Nilsson's peculiar sensibIlity 
dominates the disc. His world view as 
reflected in his songwriting is approximately 
one-half old ·fashioned whimsy, one·half

Good jams 
rare on 
'don't ask' 
continued from page 12 
"Don't Ask. " He follows an 
especially scorching solo by 
Coryell beautifully, playing 
in a bluesy manner, making a 
co ncise and eloquent 
statement in his own idiom. 

"Tai-Chi," easily the 
compositional high point of 
the record, is a haunting tune 
featuring Rollins playing an 
orientally-flavored melody on 
the Iyricon's upper register. 
Thts tune features Rollins' 
most expressive playing. 
Certainly it is his most 
daring and inquisitive 
playing on this album. 

But this is the exception for 
Rollins ' playing is inquisitive 
and daring only too rarely . 
The opening tune, "Harlem 
Boys,' is repetitive to the 
point of aggravation, and his 
playing is so relaxed that he 
seems detached . 

Compositionally, the 
album has very little to say. 
Most of the songs played by 
the entire group (which in 
addition to Rollins and 
Coryell includes Mark 
Soskin-piano, Jerome 
Harris-electric bass, AI 
Foster-drums and Bill 
Summers-percussion) are 
very uninspired grooves 
beneath equally, or more 
uninspired melodic themes. 
Particularly offensive were 
"Disco Monk," and "And 
Then I Found You_" "Monk" 
does feature a searing be-bop 
solo by Rollins, but the 
discoesque idiom is so 
repugnant that the piece is 
barely listenable. "Ant Then 
I Found You" is a miserable 
arrangement of a still more 
miserable tune. 

On the whole, despite some 
exceptional moments 
(particularly on side two), the 
album is disappointing. In his 
playing, Rollins betrays a 
complacency, a stilling of 

c~riosity quite incon&n:'ous 
With the nature of jazz. 
Unlike Coryell, an artist still 
exploring and expanding, 
Rollins' playing seemed 
noncommittal, as if he were 
uninterested in his own 
work. Perhaps the privilege 
of laid-back detachment is 
the mark of elevation to a 
higher level of musicality. 
But to the young mind this 
noncommittal and safe 
approach can only signify the 
lack of the searching spirit. 
There is no pleasure of 
discovery, and the music 
sounds like that of a man 
hiding behind his own legacy.

'I yatn 
what 1 
yaln' 
l'ontinucd from page 12 

Nilsson's Popeye songs are, 
apart from their arrange-
ments, rather minimal 
(Charles Champlin in the Los 
Angeles Times called them 
"wispy," a reasonably 
accurate adjective). The best 
of them, including "I Yam 
What I Yam," and "He's~ 
Large" and "Blow Me 
Down," set sparse, fragmen-
ted lyrics to moderate-
tempoed pop tunes. Their 
charm is admittedly elusive 
- if juxtaposing references 
to "somewhere over the 
rainbow" with "I'll show you 
mine if you show me yours" 
sounds funny to you, then 
you can appreciate the 
Nilsson wit. 

Greater claims can be 
made for the LP's arrange-
ments by Van Dyke Parks, 
former recording artiste and 
long- time sessionsman, 
about whom I could write 
several articles of critical 
praise. He embellishes the 
Popeye tracks with an 
enticing blend of maritime 
folk (suggested by accordions 
and banjos) and symphonic 
pop (his string writing is 
quite inventive). Parks' 
penchant for ironic musical 
touches is evident through-
out. In back of "Sweet-
haven's" lush orchestral 
veneer, for instance, is a 
rhythm machine percolating 
a disco beat. In fact, the 
Popeye soundtrack is as much 
Parks' project as it is 
Nilsson's. 

Would you enjoy this LP? 
Possibly - if vou're in the 
mood for what it offers_ A 
stylishly rendered exercise in 
creative camp, the Papeye 
record is indeed "wispy." But 
winning. 

Buck 
suffers 
continued from page 15 
are used ' sparingly yet 
spectacularly. The episode's 
main weakness is in the 
peripheral characters who 
remain accessories. On the 
whole though, it was a pretty 
satisfying piece of television 
science fiction and a promise 
of hope for future "Buck" 
shows. 

That promise was perhaps 
too great because the 
following two episodes, 
"Journey to Oasis" and "The 
Guardian" had fallen into a 
formula too quickly. The old 
contrived air has reprised in a 
mild form and the characters 
have lapsed into blandness. 
Particularly evident is the 
downfall of the Hawk, a new 
character who had been 
introduced as a prideful, 
stubborn being with a beef 
against humanity. 

With the exception of the 
universally acclaimed Star 
Trek, science fiction on 
television has almost always 
suffered from inferior 
writing and production. It 
has always seemed either too 
silly, too phony, or too 
pretentious. Wouldn't it be 
great if Buck Rogers, science 
fiction's favorite son, is able 
totran gre s thi byvirtueof 
his a yet unexplored 
qualities?

Buck Rogers TV 
show improves 

Show remains foolish though 
Mention the name "Buck 

Rogers," and you'll probably 
get a flash of recognition from 
whomever you are talking to. 
It is now practically common 
knowledge that Buck is a 
20th century Earth man who 
is ... hurled IOto the future, 
never to return to his own 
time again. Not that this 
worries him very much. The 
29th century, where he fi nds 
himself, is much too full of 
adventure for him to concern 
himself with such trifles . 

Born on January 7, 1929, 
Buck began life as an 
intrinsically cruddy comic 
strip and went on to become 
an intrinsically cruddy film 
serial. Regardless of this 
however, he became an 
American legend of sorts, 
inspiring such modern myths 

obvious that we are watching 
a production. Nothing 
happens naturally. Are we to 
believe that reality is all a 
contrivance? Such obvious 
bait as roller disco, futuri s tic 
Olympics and 25th century 
rock'n'roll is laid to ensnare 
hapless viewers . 

Any entertainment value 
contained herein is purely 
unintentional. Watching this 
boob junket through space is 
unroariously funny. The 
only thing missing is Sal U. 
Lloyd to supply the mi sing 
punch lines. Still, anyone 
in ulted by this mess should 
be ashamed of himself. True, 
it's proof of the producers' 
underestima t ion of the 
audience's IQ, but it' s also a 
good representation of their 
own. The best thing to do is

The Be t of Laserium is a tunning, 
swirling collage of vibrant colors and 
Krypton laser illusion. It's technology 
colliding with color, form and sound - a 
futuristic fantasy that the Los A~eles 
Times' described as "astral fireworks!' as Star Wars. The Space 

opera format of both has 
proven to be highly 
entertaining and surpri-
singly enduring. Today the 
legend of Buck lives on in the 
form of a television series on 
NBC. Needless to say, it to is 
intrinsically awful though 
fun in a strange kind of way. 

Coming from the Glen 
(Battlestar Ga/actica) Larson 
family of exploitation 
television series', Buck 
Rogers in the 25th Century 
has a complicated past. First 
planned as a television 
miniseries, the project was 
trimmed down to a feature 
length presentation which 
was unable to decide whether 
it should be on TV or in the 
theaters . Alas, Universal 
Studios, the site of Buck's 
reincarnation, chose to 
release it to theaters 
everywhere, inspired by a 
yen to 'cash in on Star Wars 
popularity (A touch of irony! 
A touch of irony!). The result 
was an instantly for~ettable 
mishmash of fantazold fluff. 
Anybody even remotely 
interested in the project 
would have thought that 
Buck would stop here. Ah, 
but Hollywood resourceful-
ness rides again! Not ones 
who would waste a good 
concept, Butk's producers set 
forth to conquer TV land. 

Predictably, Buck's boob 
tube debut was his jaunt 
across the silver screen 
edited for television. Ouring 
the; show's first-season run, 
the viewer was presented 
with the adventures of a 
wise-cracking, half-baked 
astronaut who is supposed to 
be a hero. As a'person, Buck 
was a pretty despicable 
character because of his 

smu~ness which diluted 
J)TactlcalIy every situation. 
For brainy-types, the 
character was to have been 
the focus for identification 
because he would use real 
20th century jargon. Why, 
this man listened to Three 
Dog Night tapes. Space 
princesses continually pawed 
at him. If that isn't a model 
man for today, I'm on the 
wrong planet! Of course, the 
25th century environment 
isn't all that redeeming 
either. It is too painfully 

sit back and laugh. 
Paintings, Paste· Ups, and Constructions by

reception tomorrow at 5 pm.

Fortunately, pressure from 
the show's star, Gil Gerard, 
as well as from other 
members of the production 
company forced the powers-
that·be to reevaluate their 
approach to their product . 
The results of this are now 
beginning to surface. The 
second season opened a few 
weeks ~o with an episode 
entitled' Hawk." This was a 
peak for Buck because all the 
excesses of the previous year 
were junked in favor of good 
television storytelling. It 
wasn 't perfect, mind you; but 
it was pretty well done. Buck 
was able to pull himself from 
the depths he had sunk into 
to become a pretty sympathe-

tic guy'. Tpe plot "(as m re 
complex and airtight than 
anything ever dope in the 
first season. Increased 
control and restraint were 
evident. 

Gunsmoke, Mantly saw 
potential in the show and 
instituted some very radical 
changes in an altempt to 
make a s ilk purse out of a 
sow's ear. The second 
season's format moves the 

allowing more scope to 
writers. That scope was 
greatly used in "Hawk" 
because it painted a very 
credible picture of life in 
Buck's established universe. 
The main characters are well 
developed and they mesh well 
with the story. Special effects 

All of these improvements 
are largely due to the show's 
new producer , John Mantly.

how's location from the 
Earth to a deep space vessel 
called the "Searcher," thus please turn to page 14

~I"P-S from the Budman 
IJespite rumors to the contrary, basketball is not the only gaol· 

oriented iJlOrt being played on campus this winter Quarter. In fact, 
purists of the "other two," soccer and floor hockey, insist that theirs is 
the most skilled sport. After all, in basketball you can touch the ball 
with your hands. 

Ah .... that explains it. No wonder all of those soccer and hockey 
scor-s are 1-0. Man-oh·man ... now there's some excitement! Don't ever 

the fact that low·scoring games are dull and boring. Soccer and 
,.ockey enthusiasts will hand you your head on a platter. They abso· 
lutely love those one·to·zipper thrillers .. . something about all of the 
synchronized energy and teamwork that goes into the achievementof 
each ,oal scored. Geez ... and all along we laymen thought that those 
things were just luck. Hmm ... one of these days we'll catch on . 

In the interim, soccer and hockey is off and flying in 1981. A Quick 
survey of the Budman's initial rankings in these two sports will give 
everyone a plie's-eye lIiew of what's happenin' between the lines.

UCSD B -bailers 
conte back too late 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
UCSD's men's basketball team fell to the Lancers of Cal 

Baptist here Tuesday night, 70-61, despite a strong comeback 
in the second half. 

The Tritons returned from intermission down 42-24, but 
scored eight of the first 10 second-half points to close the gap. 
UCSD rallied to within seven points, 48·41, with 13:44 still on 
the clock, but failed to narrow the Lancer's lead anx further. 
Triton coach John Dlock termed the Lancers, 'the be~l 
disciplined team I've seen this sea on." 

UCSD's offensive attack was held to outside shooting 
through most of the game, and managed to hit only 35 percent 
of its shots versus 67 percent by Cal Baptist. 

"We just didn't move the ball inside, and our outside 
shooting wasn't sharp at all," explained Block. 

Cal Baptist's Dave Fitzgerald, who led both teams with 23 
pionts , played a big part in the victory over San Diego. Kevin 
Douglas took top scoring honors for the Tritons with 15 

~nts , followed by Cameron Thomas with 13 points and 
Sherman Johnson with twelve points. Gary Haynes, who did 
not play in the second half, ended with eight points. 

UCSD will travel to Westmont College Saturday night and 
return home next Tuesday against L.A. Baptist College.

thletics: a look inside 
BY JIM AGRONICK 

AND SCOTT ALLISON 
Stalf Writers 

This is the/irst in a series of ar/icles about the Intercollegiate 
Athletics program at UCSD. 

Two years ago at this time, the Gtt-ardian published a short 
series of articles that presented an overview of sports here at 
UCSD. 

The series call d attention 
to th many problems that 
intercollegiate ports face at 
a university such as UCSD, 
where research and academ· 
ics are strongly emphasized 
over everything e1 e. 

At about the : ame time 
that t he Guardum report 

CHo rdioll Photo by Phillip Davies 

appeared, the new indicator printed an extensive series of 
articles which concluded that UCSD's Athletic Department 
suffered from weak management, stagnant thinking and 
apparent lack of concern for fielding embarrassingly weak 
UCSD teams.

The sudden burst of journalistic interest in UCSD sports 
two years ago didn 't prompt any significant action to change 
the system. Intercollegiate Athletics is run by the same people 
in the same way as in 1979. 

But if nothing else, seeds of unrest were planted by those 
articles. for this year players and coaches are more eager than 
ever to talk about what they consider to be the shortcomings 
of UCSD's Intercollegiate Athletics program. 

The complaints vary, but more often than not they follow a 
common theme and include the following; 

-The little money that the Intercollegiate Department has 
is spread too thinly over too many teams (31). 

-The athletic facilitie at UCSD don't measure up to those 
found at universitie of comparable size. 

-Coaches are paid .only part-time salaries w~en in many 
cases they work full-time hours_ 

-P.E. supervisors have more of a ~a in intercollegiate 
policy than the intercollegiate coaches themselves, 

-There is an overall lack of support for athletics from the 
intercollegiate office. 

Howard Hunt , chairman and one of the founders of the P.E. 
Department, will acknowledge the existance of a few of these 
problems, but he vehemently denies that there is a problem in 
general . 

"We have a very sound program here," Hunt said in his 
office last week. 

But others disagree, and they include ex-basketball coach 
Barry Cunningham, who has been an outspoken critic of

Can athletics thrive 
on slim resources? 
continued from page 17 
UCSD's athletic policy for years. 

In .Cunningham's opinion, Intercollegiate Athletics here is 
nothing more .t~an . "a gl~rified intramurals program" that 
promotes partlclpatton Without any regard to qUality . 

Criticism directed toward its policies is nothing new to the 
Athletic D~partment. Hunt recognizes that there are 

~oblems With the present system, but he claims that with so 
little money to work with , participation ha to come firM. 

Ju~t what is the status of intercollegiate sports at UCSD? 
And Just who are we to believe in order to get the true story? 

In the next few weeks the Guardian will take an in·depth 
look at several UCSD sports. Particular attention will be 
focused upon not only what the coaches think, but also on 
what the players the'!lselves have to say about all this, since 
the program was designed for them. 

Next: Track and Field.

PRe gives OASIS $35,000 
to fund Summer Bridge 
OASIS: (Gov't mistake almost stopped program'

News Editor 

our error. 

AS staggers in 
very tough year 

continued from page 9 
constitution. 

"But I think the students 
out there who we're 
representIng would rather 
see us spend time on crucial 
issues - housing, the 
in complete policy, the status 
of the communications 
program - than on adjusting 
to a totally new form of 
government. " 

Topkis, who is himself 
draftmg a constitution which 
would cause only minor 
changes in the AS, agrees. 

"It takes a pretty long time 
to institutionalize any 
government, " he says. "It's 
important to make periodical 
revisions of our constitution, 
a students' needs change, 
but we shouldn't just scrap 
it. That would just create 
more problems than we 
already have," says Top~is. 

"AS' members are simply 
afraid to give students a 
choice. They're not willing to 
place their Jobs on the line." 
Williams says. 

Vidal knocks. US 
coatiauecl from pale 11 

articulate pvances, and 
from economic opportunities" 
for upwn mobt1ity, Vidal 
blamed .. ~. two percent of 
the popuIMe who own the 
United StIt." for fostering 
an eoonomic system which 
has achieved "socialism for 
the rich and ·free enterprise 
for the poor. II 

Vidal welcomes the 
possibility of an upcoming 

constitutional convention, 
spearheaded by the National 
Taxpayer's Union, which has 
thus far persuaded 30 states 
to join. 

"We should take advan-
tage of such a convention," 
he said. "People at large who 
have never, in two renturies, 
been allowed to express their 
will would finally enjoy the 
Swiss equivalent · of -a 
national referendum." 

A temporary , one-year allocation of $50,000 
in opportunity funds has guaranteed the 
conti nuation of the OASIS Summer Bridge 
Program here, Acting Director of OASIS 
Carmel Myer announced ye terday. 

The Summer Bridge Program, designed to 
prepare fre hmen entering the university 
through the Educational Opportunity 
Program, faced possible extinction this year 
due to the withdrawal of a federal special 
services grant that has provided much of the 
financial upport for the program in the past. 

"We have always paid for this program from 
OASIS budgetary savings accured during the 
school year, but pro peets for this year were 
bleak because the loss of our grant (in 1980) 
made saving impossible," said Myers. 

The decision of the Policy Review 
Committee on lan. 30 to fund the program, 
confirmed by Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs and PRC Chairman John Miles 
Tuesday, has ensured that up to 50 entering 
EOP freshmen will go through the program 
this summer. 

The Summer Bridge Program, initiated in 
1978 because of EOP retention figures, provide. 
individual and small group assistance in 
math, science, writing and study skills. Most 
of the students, who are usually those EOP 
feels are least prepared for college level work, 
are housed on campus for the month long 
program, which takea.place in August. 

"We are very glad to be able to fund the 
program, which is ap'parentlr. very 
successful," said Miles, 'And whIle next 
year's budgets are very uncertain at this 
point, it is certainly our intent to fund 
Summer Bridge in the future." 

According to · retention rates gathered for 
Summer Bridge, 1978 participants and five 
comparison groups during fall quarter, 1980, 

the program is successful. EOP students who 
completed the Summer Bridge Program 
boasted a 64.3 percent retentIOn rate, while 
those who did not receive the special 

. preparation show 'a 55.6 percen~ rate. . 
The retention rate for non-EOP students 

was 53.3 percent, the figures show. 
The $50,000 in opportunity funds for tlle 

program comes from a $115,000 "package" the 
Academic Affairs Office requested for use on 
the Summer Bridge Program and other basic 
ski lls programs here. Opportunity funds are 
derived from monies gathered by the UC 
Regents from the University's various 
research contracts, and are used largely for 
overhead costs on campus.
