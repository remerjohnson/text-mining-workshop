sense to develop in these areas

The Race for Mayor--------

O'Connor, Hedgecock 
Answer to Education 

By P AT EDWARDS 
T he people of Sa n Diego 

were given a n opportul1Ity to 
l isten to the mayoral 
cand idates Monday, as Roger 
Hed gecock a nd Maureen 
O'Con nor fielded questions at 
a forum held in Ea t San 
Diego. Questions answered by 
the candidates ranged from 
student concerns to unemploy-
ment and road repairs. 

[n view of recent budget cuts 
to the University of Cali fornia 
and State UnI vers ity systems. 
both O'Connor and Hedgecock 
expressed intere t in aiding 
L'CSD and SDSU in lhe 
'itruggle to kecp tuition down . 

l~ent control and youth 
employment, both of interest 
to the student population , 
were abo discussed bi' th e 
ca ndidate~. . 

lI edgecock's sol ution to the 
severe budget cuts suffered by 
the universit ie~ is to lease 
excess or unused propertIes 
currentl} held by the 
universit ies to industry and 
trade. O'Connor looks toward 
privatc endowments and 
additional state funding as an 
aid to the crippled budgets. "I 
will actively work to lobby in 
Sacramento to keep luit ion 
down." ~aid O·Connor. a 
graduate of San Diego State. 

Rent control. an Issue of 
cOllcern to many apart ment· 
renting students i" not favored 
bi' either of thecandidates. but 
each propose construction of 
low- and Inodera te-cost 
housing de\'elopments as an 
alternative. O'Connor also 
stated long term leasing of 
public lands to private 

developers wil h F'nt stabi liza-
tion clauses to be contained 
within the leases as an opt ion. 

O·Connor. a member of the 
an Diego Port Commission. 

has been instrumental in the 
creation of both the summer 
youth employment and the _ 
City Council Internship 
programs. Hedgecock. a 
second-term county super· 
\' isor. stands firm on his belief 
that t he answer to a ll 
unemployme nt lies in the 
creation of a "business 
climate" in San Diego. an 
atmosphere attractive to the 
big business and High Tech 
indus tries currently being 
wooed from the San Diego area 
by cit ies such as Atlanta and 
liouston . 

"lL IS Important to have a 
promise of decem jobs. decent 
housing. and a decent 
em ironment for all of San 
Diego's citizens. II said 
Hedgecock. 

A possible change in parking 
regulations in the area 
"urrounding San Diego State 
l'I1l\'crstiy would prohibit 
"tudent parkrng in specified 
areas without a resident 
parking permit. Hedgecock 
and O'Connor both agreed that 
a study would have to be done 
un the problem before any 

C()nclU~lOns could be reached . 
Hedgecock added tha t. as 

was the case with a similar 
parking prob lem at University 
Hospital. a possible solution is 
a partial allocation of parking 
spaces to each interest group 
and also that San Diego State

The Road to Disarmament 
continued from page 5 
the citizens' role is -limited , 
they can help curb prolifera-
tion indirectly in certain 
countrie by choosing leaders 
who intend to limit world-wide 
nuclear weapon development. 

" If the citizens create the 
impre sion that they believe a 
nuclar freeze is in order, the 
people seeking authority will 
get the message," he said . 
Donald McQuade, Com-
muications Professor 
McQuade, a visiting professor 
from Queens College in New 
York City, . aid that he 
definitely feels nuclear 
proliferation can be stopped. 

" I think it's nece sary for 
people to articulate for 
themselves some sense of 
moral resolve, and have the 
voices in that moral resolve 
heard by as many people as 
posible,' he said, adding that 
the responsibi lity for ending 
proliferation lies in both world 
leaders and citizens. 

Concerntng current at-
tempts to end the nuclear 
dilemma, :\lcQuade said that 
"No effort is a futile effort, but 
the question is whether those 
people \vorking on thcse 
efforts are really hopeful of 
resolving the problem." 

However, he said. he doesn't 
feel that those who actively 
protest nuclear proliferation 
and development suffer from 
any hopelessness. 

"GI\'en the cultural context 
of the HO's , the I)('ople Involved 
in this mm ('ml'nt can '( be 
classified as hopeless." he 

said. "The people who are in 
these movements ha ve 
reached a personal moral 
re olve (to fight the nuclear 
problem), and once you reach 
such a resolution, hopeless-
nes isn't a problem ." 

The chief handicap of the 
anti-nuclear weapons move-
ment , according to McQuade, 
is lack of organization. 

"The wi llingness to be 
orga ni zed, amo ng the 
members of the nuclear 
movement, isn 't as apparent 
as it was in the 60's protest 
groups," he said. "What's 
missing is the \"'i llingness to 
work together, In the form of a 
lUI/lied moral resolve, at the 
level which is necessary in 
order to take political act ion." 
G. Allen Greb, Institute on 
Global Conflict and 
Cooperation (IGCC) 

Greb, who works for the 
IGCe while serving as 
research histonan for UCSD's 

cience, Technology. and 
Publtc Affairs department. 
said that nuclear proliferation 
can be stopped. The 
reslxmsibdtt) for this, he said . 
is divided among all world 
nations. 

"The re's no individual 
country or group of nation 
responsible for proliferation . 
It's the responsibility of both 
countnes that possess nuclear 
\\eaIXJt1s and those who do not 
to 'itop It." said Grebb. 

As for the current situatton 
concerning the arms raCl'. 
Grellh saicl , "Right no". the 
respunsibilit\ (for slowing 

down proliferation) lies more 
heavily on the US and the 
Soviet Union to get on with the 
things that they've promised 
in the past, as in the Non-
Proliferation Treatv, and the 
Limited Test Ban -Treaty of 
1963. " 

He also said that bringing 
such countries as France and 
China into negotiat ion s 
betwecn the US and the Soviet 
Union wou Id com pI ica te 
matters. 

" It 's almost easier to 
negotiate a treaty, with regard 
to test limitation and non-
proliferation, between the U ' 
and the oviets, and th n try 
to bnng in the other nuclea-r 
nations," he said. 

Grebil said that the nuclear 
threat is "a specialized threat 
to our existence," and 
compared the current protests 
against nuclear arms to the 
atmospheric-testing protests 
of the late 50's. The current 
m()\enll'nt. he added, "IS a 
product of our current 
Presidential administration 
and its rhetoric ahout nuclear 
\\ arfarc, \\ hat's happening In 
Europe, and the ine\ Itable 
modert1lZatlOn of weaponry 
that's occuring all over the 
world." 

As for the effect of public 
protesting on polttical 
ideolog), Grebb said. "The 
pu blIc movement for a f ree7e 
has a very defintte tmpact on 
the direction our government 
takes on thiS matter PubliC 
opinion certainl y ha.., an 
Impact on government policy "

The San Diego Symphony was 
born a couple of years ago. 
having been. to confuse a 
metaphor a little. in labor for 
many years before that. 
Occasionally. like a psychic. one 
gets glimpses of its former life 
without flair or originality -
anything that would distinguish 
it' from a symphonic player 
piano. 

Of black bottom pies, the S.D. 
Symphony, and Bernard Hands 

David Atherton is off somewhere 
else. (Of course there are pieces 
even Atherton cannot make 
interesting.) Matthew Garbutt. 
the assistant conductor. 
recently interpreted Haydn 's 
Symphony No. 1 and a 
Mendelssohn concerto for two 
pianos quite adequately. but 
lacked the energy and novelty, 
even clarity which Atherton 
brings to every work, Last week 
Uri Segal conducted aJewel-like 
concerto of Mozart. The 
orchestra progressed in a 
pedestrian manner. amicably 
accompanied by Rudolf 
Firkusny on the piano. who 
sounded like a gentleman and a 
scholar but. well. not like 
terribly much else. 

With a great boredom 
induced restlessness and Chart 
House black bottom pie caused 
ind igestion. I sit far into the 
night to describe a pitfall for the 
orchestra, one filled with a ' 
suffocating muddiness, and how 
the fall can be avoided. 

The original sin was the 
knowledge of thrill and 
boredom. People wanted to 
pursue thrill , but they were 
always about to slip back into 
boredom. The tune was 
employed and was for a few 
thousand years quite enough. 

In the 19th century. however. 
music went through a 
revolution, and the tune was 
abandoned in. unfortunately, 
not an embarrassed silence but 
an immodest noise. Some 
composers were influenced by 
folk music: Dvorak. for instance. 
used the pibroch of Scottish 
bagpipers. a group to whom 
W.S. Gilbert addressed the lines: 
" If you really must play on that 
cursed affair, / My goodnessl 
play something resembling an 
air." 

~~: ~ :~;v:.~: L .. ~.;-c;~-! 
American symphones fear 

public reaction, since they are 
not supported by the 
government. and every year in 
their programming they 
struggle with whether to 

sacrifice Art or the Box Office. 
That is why the repetoire usually 
is packed with the more florid 
Romantics. with a few classical 
composers and almost no 
modern ones. florid Romantics 
are all very well. but why should 
their most forgettable pieces. or 
rather their pieces one would 
most want to forget. be chosen? 
It is from Uszt. after all. that the 

"a massive piece of 
beige ice cream on 
a thin crust of. .. " 
.. ~lcDonald 's Breakfast" theme 
which swept commercial 
announcement breaks with such 
success only a few summers ago 
came, 

Speaking. extraordinary as it 
might seem. of food. the after 
theater supper is as much part 
of the cultural event as the 
music itself. The Chart House 
aspires to be one of the 
restaurants that provide this 
fare by having a reputation for 
black bottom pie, 

The reputation is spurious. 
Black bottom pie consists of a 
combination of chocolate 

.custard. rum custard and 
whipped cream which makes 
one feel like one of the later 
Roman emperors with only a 
very small slice. The Chart 
House serves under this name a 
massive lump of beige ice 

By JAl'It:S RALPH PAPP 
cream of an indeterminate 
flavor on a thin piece of frozen 
chocolate (not one of 
civilization's taste treats) with a 
little caramel and a glob of 
whipped cream. The work is as 
large, unvarying and wan as the 
Dante Symphony. and as the 
other produces a mental and 
spiritual indigestion, this 
produces a physical one. 

These kinds of symphonies 
and so-called pies or failed 
sundaes, give the pursuance of 
culture a bad name and 
perpetuate the reputation 
America has for caring only 
about size and not form. with 
which Oscar Wilde dealt when 
he said the Niagra falls were 
"simply a vast unnecessary 
amount of water going the 
wrong way and then falling over 
unnecessary rocks. " 

Far different from this is 
Bernard Rands (UCSD's own -
Rahl) and his Madrigali. which 
the San Diego Symphony played 
recently. Rands has no tunes, 
but unlike these 19th century 
composers he admits it. and 
SUbstitutes other kinds of 
emotional and intellectual 
form. 

The music expresses 
emotion. but it also seems to 
express the movement of the 
mind. Of course music is less 
concrete than. say, literature in 
expressing these things. or at 
least in doing it less easy to 
analyze and explain. The final 

movement. for instance. begins 
with a tune. the only one, which 
evokes heaven In a way no 
music has done since Bach·s. 
One part of the explanation is 
that it is played by high. thin 
strings. but this does not go far. 
One might search for the 
explanation among technical 
terms of keys and modes and so 
forth. but even if one were 

"The San Diego 
Symphony needs 
more of Rands ... " 
successful the success would 
ruin the beauty of the musical 
phrases. 

However. what makes the 
movement genius, or merely 
adds to the genius, is the 
underlying note (literally) of 
uncertainty. a pale but apparent 
clashing line. This qualifies the 
beauty and questions the 
heaven in a way that is as clear 
as anything on the written page. 
The San Diego Symphony needs 
more of Bernard Rands. but I 
suppose they will think that 
their audience. wh ich sleeps 
happily through Liszt. would be 
frightened away by him. 

The Symphony's fall into dull 
music is not as significant as its 
occasional fall into lacklustre 
rendition. because, interesting 
enough. these performances 
seem always to occur when 

When one presents a 
colorfully wrapped box of 
sweets labelled 'culture: and 
after consuming several of the 
delightful confections the 
recipient bites into a series of 
duds, one 's present is soon 
spurned. The same applies to 
symphonies and. if I may return 
to the black bottom pie theme. 
desserts. 

Instead of serving quite so 
many of what it imagines to be 
safe pieces under safe 
conductors. the San Diego 
Symphony should try new and 
uncommon pieces under the 
conductor who seems to have a 
golden touch of freshness, like a 
Midas in. if I may mention it. 
much better evening dress than 
most of the guest conductors. 
Of course in this last season 
dullness has been the exception. 
and there is yet no reason to shy 
from what appears to be 
generally delicious and, over 
time. pleasantly fattening.

UCSD to Get Fitness Projects 
By KAREN GARCIA 

What is new in fitness? Just 
ask John Cates, physical 
ed ucation supervi sor and 
innova tor of programs to 
en hance the physical fitness 
opportunities of the UCSD 
community. Cates is very 
tnterested in prom oting 
f·itn ess on campus for 
st udenl:-.. f acu Ity. and st aff 
al ike. and new facilities for 
exercise are in the planning. 

Cates' current project is a 
"fit ness cou rt " to be installed 
lx'h ind the tenni" rebound 
boards next to t he sand 
\olleyball courts. A compact 
.l2' x 32' sand area \>,.ill hold 16 
exercise sta tion s v.:hich, 
according to Cates. are 
"ue..,igned to work al l the 
com ponents of ph~~" ca l

flexibility, strength. cardia· 
rl'spmltory endurance. and 
coordination . A~ a total 
condi tioning routine, the 
fit ness court is ideal to 
.llIgment cyc ling, jogging, 
\\ alking, or swimming. The 
court will provide relief from 
an overcrowded weight room 
and its central location near

course in the woods bet\\een 
Central Librarv and Genesee

hundred people use that 

course daily . The new fitness 
stations will be like those on 
the fitness course but in a 
more compact and centralized 
area. 

Another project in theworks 
is a map of the running lraib 
around UCSD. The map will 
be mIJunted on a redwood and

:. ;: 

San Diego will get a rare cultural treat tonight with the prcmit~r~ of Abel GJncc', e:l 
ma~terpieee Napoleon. which screens tonight in the Spreckels Theater at i :30 pm. Be'iides the 1 
nostalgic quality of this 1927 silent film. Napoleon has been regarded <IS one of the greatest 
films of all time: and is in caliber with those few great movies by which all arc judged. 

In additon to the no holds barred maverick style Ganer usrd in creating this film. he dlso 
pioneered a wide-screen technique which he called ' Polyvision:" a visual man't'l that pre-
dated Cinerama by 30 years. but who e technical advancement was lost to the advent of 
" talkies" a few months later. 

Though it was virtually ignored for 50 years after its release. Francis Ford Coppola s 
Zoetrope Studios re cued dozens of reel of original footage fTOm archives around the world 
and edited them into its present four hour version. The 1981 rclea of Napoleon by Zoetrope 
resulted in near riotuous enthusiasm from ritics and audience alike. 

Napoleon is now in general release from Zoetrope in conjuction with Universal Picture . and 
the San Diego Film Society is bringing it here for an inaugural fundraising event in order to 
benefit future performances of similar great films. 

There will be a reception in the Speckel Theater lobby at 6:30 pm. preceeding the 
creening. Both the reception and the film are included in the $10 ticket price. for more 

information please call 222-9022.

la Jolla Stage Company tackles 
the outrageous 'Blithe Spirif 

8y JOAN fORS8ERG 
The scene: A successful 

novelist is happily married to 
his second wife when , 
suddenly. his beautiful. but 
jealous, first wife breezes back 
into his life to torment him. 
Sounds like a typical plot on an 
afternoon soap? Here's the 
twist". The first wife has been 
dead for seven years. 

Thus begin the outrageous 
complications of Noel Coward's 
witty comedy Blithe Spirit 
currently being presented by 
the la Jolla Stage Company. 

The setting of this unusual 
farce is the charming English 
country estate of writer Charles 
Condomine. Charles' current 
project is a novel examining a 
supernatural medium. To pick 
up some tricks of the trade. 
Charles and hi wife Ruth invite 
the eccentric Madame Arcati. a 
self-proclaimed spiritualist. to 
dine and perform a midnight 
seance at their home. The 
seance appears to be a failure to 

everyone involved except the 
bt!wildered Charles. 

With her wild (and 
questionable) ritual. Madame 
Arcati conjures up more than 
Charles desires. The temptress 
Elvira appears unexpectedly, in 
ghostly matter. visible and 
audible only to her former 
husband. While Charles' wife 
and friends, the Bradmans, arc 
convinced that Charies ha., gone 
mad, talking to ,>omeone who 
just h not there the astral 
bigamist" Charles i., torn 
between his earthly and otht'r 
worldly wives, To make matters 
worc;c f1vira will do anything to 
reclaim the afiections of her 
husband. 

The ~ Jolla Stage Company.., 
production is a gem. Smoothly 
directed by Walter Stewart, the 
play is highlighted with 
exceptional performances by 
Mimette Ehrenfreud as Madame 
Arcati ; Pamela Adams-Regan as 
t.lvira; and James Brown as 
Charles. Ehrenfreund is a 

hilarious Madame Arcati. flying 
around the room. waving a scarf. 
and chanting incomprehensible 
hocus-pocus. 

Jerry Dunn's skillfully 
designed set of the Condomine 
I iving room is complete with all 
the haunted house necessities: 
doors opening magically, books 
falling mysteriously, and at 
least one mischievous ghost. 

Many revivals of the clerer 
Noel Cm\ard's classic comedies 
ha\e beul produced recently 
including the Taylor-Burton 
teaming in Priuale J.IUP..~, Nm\ it 
is not necessary to go to New 
York to c;ce an eternally funny

performances of Blithe Spirit 
are this weekend at the I'arker

Concert Line 

X-fest set 
for Stadium 
Saturday 

Bv JOHN N[[ 
The concept behind the 

, festi \al" type concert gained a 
myst ique in the Woodstock 
generation that has never been 
repeated since people gathered 
on a pig fann for three days to 
be wet dnd muddy over a decade 
ago, In more recenl time~, 
( ntert promoters ha\e staged 
enormous outdoor concerts in 

hope~ of ca~hing in big vcry 
quickly. Such extra\'aganzas are 
often al~o billed (I'> po~sible 
groundbreaking events a~ 
Woodstock was, 

More often than not. those 
responsible for the organization 
of festivals play up some 
weighty social issue as nuclear 
weapons or the evolution of the 
mora II'S facing society's view of 
itself. This coming weekend San 
Diego will be privy to yet 
another outdoor monstrosity at 
the Stadium called X-Fest. 

The disturbing thing about 
this festival in particular is that 
it is mnsidered to be modern 
music. The idea behind modern 
music of this genre is that it is 
removing popular bands from 
the large venues and making 
them accessible in clubs and at 
a smaller ticket price. Now there 
are those in " the industry" that 
are trying to take the San Diego 
market and exploit it to the 
point where it existed five years 
ago. 

On the bill of this modern 
music are Tom Petty, Modem 
fnglish, Stray Cats, The flirts, 

Tom Petty and Ule Heartbrt>aker'1> \\' iII headl ine Saturday's X·t'esl. 

and Bow-Wow-Wow. On this 
lineup, the onl y va luable act has 
to be The Ramones, The mere 
thought that anyone who would 
release a single with Stevie 
Nicks (i.e. Thomas Petty and the 
Heartbreakers ) as modern 
music is ludicrous. Even though 
such major artists as David 
Bowie and The Who will play in a 
stadium, their concerts are 
successful due to an artistic 
draw as opposed to a 
synthesized event to deceive the 
public into thinking they are 
hip, 

The summer season at the 
SDSU Amphitheater has always 
offered a refreshing alternative 
to the typical concert fare in and 
about San Diego, Aside from 
offering acts that would not 
gain exposure elsewhere, the 
p~gramming is so varied that It 

Offers something for everyone. 
Chick Corea's infl uence as a 

jazz keyboardist has been 
unrivaled. His consistency as a 
performer and recording artist 
has never known a dry moment. 
In 1973, Corea formed, with 
colleagues Bill Conners, Stan 
Clarke, and Lenny White, 
Return to forever, 

Return to Forever developed 
a musical concept rarely found 
in jazz. The move into this band, 
for Corea. brought about a 
change from esoterica into a 
new yet accessible jazz. With 
this particular tour. AI OJ Meola, 
one of the great jazz guitarists of 
our age will be included, Return 
to Forever will play Wednesday 
at the SDSU Amphitheater, 

The flaming Hibachis will 
play tonight at the Che Cafe. 
Admission is only one dollar,

Never has th is idea been more

with quality ~ood time, even

which include "What'd Ya Oo?, ' 
"Somcbody uke Me " and Carter

accented, ~Icdgchammel 
vocals, All this combined with a 
return to a more primative 
production make5 Subterra-
nean Jungle the Ramoncs best 
since Road to Ruin. 

The band is even more 
convincing when stacked up 
against the vast number of 
outfits which attempt to play 
the same music or something 
derivable thereof. While the no-
frills. assaulting approach was 
not conceived by the Ramones, 
they certainly have carved it 
into their own unique vehicle 
which although simple in 
nature, is not readily duplicated 
by anyone. 

It is very difficult to argue 
with anything the Ramones do. 
f rom their "punk " beg inning in 
the mid 70s to the present. the 
band ha~ steadi Iy maintained its 
street-wi~ image throughout

have scI'n the death of many of

conviction. Throughout the 
band's career, ,some have tried 
to di')mi ,~s them as " human 
chainsaws" who hammer out 
three power chords in two-and-
a-half minutes and call it a song. 
Unfortunately, these people are 
missing the point. True enough. 
the Ramones will never be 
awarded for instrumental grace 
or commended for deeply 
thematic lyrics, but the band 
wouldn't have it any other way. 
They could care less how many 
times they repeat the same 
chord structure or sing "Yeah 
Yeah,"

'Bad Boys'-

---AT THE MOVIES 

By CLYDEN[ N[f 
Screenwriter Richard Dilello 

has openly admitted that he 
made up much of the fiI m script 
of Bad Boys without doing 
research on the issue of juvenile 
crime, This is painfully obvious 
from the plot of the film; it is so 
predictable that sometimes one 
wonders if Di leila graduated 
from a mail order school for 
script writing. 

The actors did a good job with 
what they had to work with. 
Sean Penn, known for his roles 
in Taps and fast Times at 
Ridgemont High. plays Mick 
O'Brien, a young man hustling 
out on the street. Through the 
circumstances of a drug deal 
that went down badly he is 
placed inside Rainford Juvenile 
Correctional Facility, and is 
assigned to 'Dorm C' where the 
critical offenders are placed. 

Esai Morales, portrayed Paco 
Moreno, a young chicano 
seeking to avenge the death of 
his brother, who was killed by 
Mick as he fled from the police. 

Violence overflows from this 
film ; murder, rape , armed 
robbery and drug trafficking 
become more than minor 
occurences in the film - they 
are the film. After a while the 
four-letter words and the 
violence become common-
place, and from the cheers of the 
audience it seemed that perhaps 
we are going back to the times 
of the Gladiators in Rome.

The San Diego Symphony was 
born a couple of years ago. 
having been. to confuse a 
metaphor a little. in labor for 
many years before that. 
Occasionally. like a psychic. one 
gets glimpses of its former life 
without flair or originality -
anything that would distinguish 
it' from a symphonic player 
piano. 

Of black bottom pies, the S.D. 
Symphony, and Bernard Hands 

David Atherton is off somewhere 
else. (Of course there are pieces 
even Atherton cannot make 
interesting.) Matthew Garbutt. 
the assistant conductor. 
recently interpreted Haydn 's 
Symphony No. 1 and a 
Mendelssohn concerto for two 
pianos quite adequately. but 
lacked the energy and novelty, 
even clarity which Atherton 
brings to every work, Last week 
Uri Segal conducted aJewel-like 
concerto of Mozart. The 
orchestra progressed in a 
pedestrian manner. amicably 
accompanied by Rudolf 
Firkusny on the piano. who 
sounded like a gentleman and a 
scholar but. well. not like 
terribly much else. 

With a great boredom 
induced restlessness and Chart 
House black bottom pie caused 
ind igestion. I sit far into the 
night to describe a pitfall for the 
orchestra, one filled with a ' 
suffocating muddiness, and how 
the fall can be avoided. 

The original sin was the 
knowledge of thrill and 
boredom. People wanted to 
pursue thrill , but they were 
always about to slip back into 
boredom. The tune was 
employed and was for a few 
thousand years quite enough. 

In the 19th century. however. 
music went through a 
revolution, and the tune was 
abandoned in. unfortunately, 
not an embarrassed silence but 
an immodest noise. Some 
composers were influenced by 
folk music: Dvorak. for instance. 
used the pibroch of Scottish 
bagpipers. a group to whom 
W.S. Gilbert addressed the lines: 
" If you really must play on that 
cursed affair, / My goodnessl 
play something resembling an 
air." 

~~: ~ :~;v:.~: L .. ~.;-c;~-! 
American symphones fear 

public reaction, since they are 
not supported by the 
government. and every year in 
their programming they 
struggle with whether to 

sacrifice Art or the Box Office. 
That is why the repetoire usually 
is packed with the more florid 
Romantics. with a few classical 
composers and almost no 
modern ones. florid Romantics 
are all very well. but why should 
their most forgettable pieces. or 
rather their pieces one would 
most want to forget. be chosen? 
It is from Uszt. after all. that the 

"a massive piece of 
beige ice cream on 
a thin crust of. .. " 
.. ~lcDonald 's Breakfast" theme 
which swept commercial 
announcement breaks with such 
success only a few summers ago 
came, 

Speaking. extraordinary as it 
might seem. of food. the after 
theater supper is as much part 
of the cultural event as the 
music itself. The Chart House 
aspires to be one of the 
restaurants that provide this 
fare by having a reputation for 
black bottom pie, 

The reputation is spurious. 
Black bottom pie consists of a 
combination of chocolate 

.custard. rum custard and 
whipped cream which makes 
one feel like one of the later 
Roman emperors with only a 
very small slice. The Chart 
House serves under this name a 
massive lump of beige ice 

By JAl'It:S RALPH PAPP 
cream of an indeterminate 
flavor on a thin piece of frozen 
chocolate (not one of 
civilization's taste treats) with a 
little caramel and a glob of 
whipped cream. The work is as 
large, unvarying and wan as the 
Dante Symphony. and as the 
other produces a mental and 
spiritual indigestion, this 
produces a physical one. 

These kinds of symphonies 
and so-called pies or failed 
sundaes, give the pursuance of 
culture a bad name and 
perpetuate the reputation 
America has for caring only 
about size and not form. with 
which Oscar Wilde dealt when 
he said the Niagra falls were 
"simply a vast unnecessary 
amount of water going the 
wrong way and then falling over 
unnecessary rocks. " 

Far different from this is 
Bernard Rands (UCSD's own -
Rahl) and his Madrigali. which 
the San Diego Symphony played 
recently. Rands has no tunes, 
but unlike these 19th century 
composers he admits it. and 
SUbstitutes other kinds of 
emotional and intellectual 
form. 

The music expresses 
emotion. but it also seems to 
express the movement of the 
mind. Of course music is less 
concrete than. say, literature in 
expressing these things. or at 
least in doing it less easy to 
analyze and explain. The final 

movement. for instance. begins 
with a tune. the only one, which 
evokes heaven In a way no 
music has done since Bach·s. 
One part of the explanation is 
that it is played by high. thin 
strings. but this does not go far. 
One might search for the 
explanation among technical 
terms of keys and modes and so 
forth. but even if one were 

"The San Diego 
Symphony needs 
more of Rands ... " 
successful the success would 
ruin the beauty of the musical 
phrases. 

However. what makes the 
movement genius, or merely 
adds to the genius, is the 
underlying note (literally) of 
uncertainty. a pale but apparent 
clashing line. This qualifies the 
beauty and questions the 
heaven in a way that is as clear 
as anything on the written page. 
The San Diego Symphony needs 
more of Bernard Rands. but I 
suppose they will think that 
their audience. wh ich sleeps 
happily through Liszt. would be 
frightened away by him. 

The Symphony's fall into dull 
music is not as significant as its 
occasional fall into lacklustre 
rendition. because, interesting 
enough. these performances 
seem always to occur when 

When one presents a 
colorfully wrapped box of 
sweets labelled 'culture: and 
after consuming several of the 
delightful confections the 
recipient bites into a series of 
duds, one 's present is soon 
spurned. The same applies to 
symphonies and. if I may return 
to the black bottom pie theme. 
desserts. 

Instead of serving quite so 
many of what it imagines to be 
safe pieces under safe 
conductors. the San Diego 
Symphony should try new and 
uncommon pieces under the 
conductor who seems to have a 
golden touch of freshness, like a 
Midas in. if I may mention it. 
much better evening dress than 
most of the guest conductors. 
Of course in this last season 
dullness has been the exception. 
and there is yet no reason to shy 
from what appears to be 
generally delicious and, over 
time. pleasantly fattening.

By KAREN GARCIA 

What is new in fitness? Just 
ask John Cates, physical

opportunities of the UCSD 
community. Cates is very

al ike. and new facilities for 
exercise are in the planning. 

Cates' current project is a 
"fit ness cou rt " to be installed 
lx'h ind the tenni" rebound 
boards next to t he sand 
\olleyball courts. A compact 
.l2' x 32' sand area \>,.ill hold 16 
exercise sta tion s v.:hich, 
according to Cates. are 
"ue..,igned to work al l the 
com ponents of ph~~" ca l 
fltne'>s." 1I1cludmg balance, 
flexibility, strength. cardia· 
rl'spmltory endurance. and 
coordination . A~ a total 
condi tioning routine, the 
fit ness court is ideal to 
.llIgment cyc ling, jogging, 
\\ alking, or swimming. The 
court will provide relief from 
an overcrowded weight room 
and its central location near 

, the locker room ts a further 
ddvantage.

thl' installatIon of the fitne"s 
course in the woods bet\\een 
Central Librarv and Genesee 
Ihenue. M ore than two 
hundred people use that 

course daily . The new fitness 
stations will be like those on 
the fitness course but in a 
more compact and centralized 
area. 

Another project in theworks 
is a map of the running lraib 
around UCSD. The map will 
be mIJunted on a redwood and
