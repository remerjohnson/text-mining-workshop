UC Irvine Fraternity 
Apologizes for Racist Incident

The Lambda Theta Delta fraternity was reprimanded after the 
release of a video depicting a member wearing blackface makeup.

NEWS EDITOR

UC Irvine’s Lambda Theta Delta frater-nity — the largest Asian-American fraternity at the university — apolo-
gized on Friday for a controversial music 
video depicting a member lip-syncing in 
blackface makeup to the Justin Timberlake 
song “Suit and Tie.” 

“We want to ensure everyone that this 
video does not represent the views of the col-
lective house,” LTD said in a Facebook post. 
“With that being said, it does acknowledge 
the fact that we have some ignorant indi-
viduals within our organization, with whom 
we have already dealt with ourselves.”

The video featured fraternity brothers 
Justin T. Nguyen, Tony D. Duong and Philip 
Lam dancing while dressed in formal suits, 

with brother Rainier Nanquil portraying 
rapper Jay-Z in blackface.

According to a statement from LTD pres-
ident Darius Obana, the action was not 
intended to be offensive; when released 
on YouTube on April 16, the music video 
included the description: “No racism intend-
ed. All fun and laughter.” 

Nevertheless, the fraternity received a 
great deal of backlash from several student 
organizations across the campus.

In a statement to NY Daily News, the 
UC Irvine Asian Pacific Student Association 
said that the LTD is not a constituent of the 
APSA, separating itself from the fraternity.

San Diego and Tijuana 
Bid to Co-Host Olympics
The cities’ joint proposal has reached a short list of 10 
cities currently under consideration to be hosts in 2024.

ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR

San Diego’s plans to host the 
2024 Summer Olympics in a joint 
bid with Tijuana made it to a list 
of 10 U.S. cities currently under 
consideration to be hosts, according 
to U.S. Olympic Committee Chief 
Executive Scott Blackmun and San 
Diego Mayor Bob Filner. 

Blackmun confirmed in a state-
ment last Friday that the San Diego-
Tijuana proposal is on a short list 
that also includes Los Angeles and 
Philadelphia.

Filner first announced his plans 
to create a binational proposal for the 
Olympics in February after the USOC 
invited San Diego and 32 other cities to 
bid for the opportunity to host.

Filner, a Democrat, hopes that for-
mer Republican presidential nominee 
Mitt Romney will lead the two cit-
ies’ campaign and believes that his 
presence would add validity to the 
proposal.

“I’d like [Romney] to be the honor-
ary chair of this whole effort,” Filner 
said, according to an April 27 story 
that appeared in the U-T San Diego.

In addition to owning a house 

in La Jolla, Romney served as presi-
dent of the Salt Lake City Organizing 
Committee for the Olympic and 
Paralympic Games that hosted the 
Winter Olympics in Utah in 2002.

Romney has yet to respond pub-
licly to Filner’s request.

A previous effort to hold a bina-
tional Olympic Games between San 
Diego and Tijuana was first considered 
by local real estate developer Malin 
Burnham in 2006. Burnham’s commit-
tee found the idea financially sound, 
but USOC ultimately shot down the 
proposal in the first round of consid-
eration.

Filner also said that the cities of 
San Diego and Tijuana would release 
a joint statement in the next 10 days as 
they prepare their Olympic commit-
tees. If Filner’s proposal succeeds, the 
event will become the first binational 
Olympic Games.

The International Olympic 
Committee will select a host city for 
the 2024 Olympic Games in 2017.

Researchers Use Algae to 
Create Edible Vaccines
Investigators at the Mayfield Laboratory are hoping to 
use algae in developing an edible vaccine for malaria.

UCSD researchers at the Mayfield 
Laboratory have been working on 
developing a malaria vaccine using 
algae. On April 19, they published 
their discoveries collected this past 
year from their most recent study.

This study’s primary researchers 
were principal investigator Stephen 
Mayfield, professor of biology; post-
doctoral fellow James Gregory; and 
undergraduate researchers Aaron 
Topol and David Doerner.

The researchers discovered that 
after feeding mice the dried algae, 
which retained functional vaccine 
proteins, the antibodies were seen 

in their gut but not in their blood. 
Because the antibodies must be in 
the blood for the malaria vaccine 
to work, the proteins used in this 
vaccine are not effective. However, 
this study does show that a different 
protein may be effective in getting 
the antibodies into the bloodstream.

“Since the feeding did induce 
antibodies we know the system 
works,” Mayfield said. “Now we just 
need to identify a protein that can 
move the protein from the gut into 
the blood system so we can get anti-
bodies there.”

▶ Two women assaulte near SDSU 
campus: Last week, two women 
in their 20s were grabbed while 
they were walking near San Diego 
State University. The first incident 
occurred on April 15 at 9 p.m. on 
Campanile Drive. A man described 
as wearing glasses and a hood drove 
up beside the victim in a four-door 
Toyota Tacoma and grabbed her arm. 
The following Sunday around 3 a.m. 
in an alley off of Montezuma Road, a 
tall Asian man with spiked hair and 
glasses tried to pull a woman by her 
arm and leg. Each woman managed 
to break free from the assailants.

▶ Man dies after being pinned on 
trailer by wife: Last Wednesday, 
police began investigating the death 
of a 64-year-old man who was 
pinned between a trailer and a car 

by his wife in La Mesa. The wife was 
backing her car up when the accident 
occurred around 1 p.m. on Tuesday. 
According to a police report, the 
man died on the scene on the 4400 
block of Dale Avenue.

▶ Horton Plaza Jewelry Thief: San 
Diego Police have released a photo 
in hopes of identifying a man sus-
pected of taking $20,000 worth of 
custom jewelry. The suspect stole 
the jewelry from a car parked in the 
Westfield Horton Plaza Mall down-
town on April 1. A man caught on 
a surveillance video was seen taking 
a red Lulu Lemon yoga bag filled 
with necklaces, earrings, rings and 
watches from the passenger seat of a 
car. The thief is described as between 
20 and 25 years old; of medium to 
normal muscular build; and wearing 

a silver and black watch, tan pants 
and a striped polo shirt. 

▶ Decreased Homelessness in the 
San Diego County: The Regional 
Task Force on the Homeless of San 
Diego County announced Thursday 
morning that there has been a 7.7 
percent decrease in homelessness 
from the previous year. The annual 
report on homelessness was account-
ed for by 900 volunteers who walked 
and drove around San Diego on Jan. 
25, counting the number of home-
less in temporary shelters and on 
the streets. Of the 8,900 people in 
shelters, on the street or sleeping in 
other means of shelter, 5,747 of them 
were in the city of San Diego. “It’s not 
an exact number,” said Dolores Diaz, 
the executive director of the Regional 
Task Force on the Homeless, “We 

will never know the exact number of 
homeless in San Diego.” 

▶ Teenagers light a car on fire: 
Two teenage boys were taken into 
custody after they had stolen a 
car on Sunday, April 21 after they 
were involved in a hit-and-run 
accident and lit a car on fire in 
the grounds of an Imperial Beach 
school. According to San Diego 
Police Officer Dan Lasher, the 16 
and 17-year-old boys were involved 
in the car accident near Mar Vista 
Middle School around 3:30 a.m.. 
They fled the scene, leaving behind 
a license plate. Later, witnesses said 
they saw the two boys light the 
car on fire at Thermal Avenue and 
Grove Avenue and then walk away. 
They have been taken to juvenile 
hall.

cines would be best expressed in 
algae for use in developing coun-
tries with lower levels of technology, 
malaria was a top choice because it 
could be developed on a large scale 
using low costs.

“It’s too costly to vaccinate two 
billion people using current technolo-
gies,” Mayfield said in an article from 
the UCSD News Center. “Realistically, 

the only way a malaria vaccine will 
ever be used in the developing world is 
if it can be produced at a fraction of the 
cost of current vaccines.”

Last year, the Mayfield Laboratory 
successfully made injectable vaccines, 
while this past year they researched an 
edible vaccine using dried algae.

“Malaria remains one of the worst 
diseases on the planet, and we still 
have no vaccine for it, so any step, 
even a small one like this, is encour-

aging,” Mayfield said.
In the future, the researchers will 

test other proteins to try to identify 
proteins that can transport antibod-
ies into the blood system. There are 
several proteins other researchers have 
successfully utilized to get antibodies 
into the blood system that the Mayfield 
Laboratory researchers may try next.

“We, the Black Student Union, 
will no longer stand for the continu-
ous disrespect of our community,” 
the university’s Black Student Union 
said in an official statement. “This 
is a UC system wide issue, and 
ultimately, a world-wide issue. Anti-
Blackness and racism is reproduced 
within each UC campus, whether 
in the form of nooses at UC San 
Diego or Ku Klux Klan hoods in 
UC Davis.”

UCSD Vice President of External 

Affairs Olamide Noah also released 
a statement in condemnation of 
UC-wide racist incidents including the 
UC Irvine music video.

“The UC is not doing enough 
to punish these acts,” Noah said. 
“Impunity is a dangerous thing, and 
this issue is not an isolated incident. 
When you have black students being 
called ‘ungrateful n*ggers’ on the stu-
dent tun television station at UCSD, 
cotton balls being scattered in front of 
an African American Resource Center, 
affirmative action bake sales at UC 
Berkeley … it becomes very apparent 

that the university as an institution has 
an anti-black environment.”

According to UC Irvine 
Chancellor Michael Drake, the uni-
versity is currently investigating the 
incident.

“We will use this regrettable inci-
dent to redouble campus education 
efforts about the toxic effects of 
insensitivity and will continue to 
work toward building a truly inclu-
sive community,” Drake said.

Thinking Caps

Given that humans are sup-posedly wise “sapiens” with highly attuned self-preserva-
tion instincts, it’s bewildering that we 
have such a love for the speedy death-
traps that are roller coasters. Looping 
upside down and rocketing forward 
fast enough to shove your eyes back-
ward through your head is blatantly 
contrary to the theory of natural 
selection. Yet we step off them dazed 
and confused while grinning from ear 
to ear. With rollercoasters, like many 
of the things we’re addicted to, the 
threat of calamity is what makes them 
endearing. We can’t stop doing exactly 
what we swear will kill us. 

Harvard University psychologist 
Robert Solomon’s 1974 “opponent-
process theory” attributes the bizarre 
allure of dangerous pursuits to how 
our body’s normal response, or 
“A-process,” to an external stimulus 
gets countered and eventually over-
whelmed by an opposite “B-process.” 
That initial euphoric A-process of 
nibbling some chocolate, for example,

Dutch organization 
Mars One is looking 

to televise their 
establishment of the 
first human colony 

on Mars in 2023, but 
their plans are too 

vague and idealistic to 
be realized.

TV Stars 
on Mars

BY   Lauren  koa   associate Opinion Editor   Illustration  by  jenny park

You could be one of the first to live on Mars in 2023. On April 22, 2013, Netherlands-based, non-profit organization Mars One opened online applications to anyone over age 18. The very next day, the 
company reported to U.S. News & World Report that they already had over 
40,000 interested contenders. But there’s a catch: Applicants must be willing to 
live — and die — on Mars. Executing this mission will also be unrealistic.

Reminiscent of a reality talent search show, Mars One intends to create a 
television series that will allow a worldwide audience to help select 40 appli-
cants. According to their website, Mars One will train the chosen individu-
als for eight years in a simulated Mars environment before choosing four to 
permanently move to the “Red Planet.” After the first crew arrives in 2023, 
groups of four and general supplies will arrive every two years. Everything 
from the astronaut selection to the day-to-day lives of the astronauts will 
be documented on television. The costs of the mission are projected to be 
adequately supported by the successful viewership of the program.

However, Mars One’s methods in carrying out their goals are idealistic, 
ill-executed and problematic — strongly resembling the premise of a sci-
ence-fiction movie about to go wrong. The organization’s media coverage 
focuses more on the reality television concept of humans living on Mars, 
rather than the mission as an actual scientific development. Mars One’s 
website compares the trip to those of historical explorers, but uses this 

“call to adventure” as a distraction for the flaws of their “road map” and 
wrongfully underestimated conditions on Mars. 

The founders of the mission report that the chosen team will be able 
to lead normal lives on Mars, but they did not reveal the exact specif-
ics as to how this will actually play out. The organization also fails to 
disclose concrete information about how the team will live under Mars’ 
harsh weather conditions, acquire necessary resources like water and 
food and deal with harmful exposure to radiation. Furthermore, the 
Mars One website and Mars One co-founder Bas Lansdorp only provide 
simplistic responses to many issues raised by skeptics.

Mars One claims that the technology for sustaining life on Mars has 
already been invented and validated. The organization states that solar 
panels will supply energy and that shielding on the spaceships along with 
specially developed “Mars suits” will prevent astronauts from extreme 
exposure to radiation. Water will be produced from heated ice. But even if 
their proposed technologies are functional on Earth, their efficacy on Mars 
remains unproven. Education, Technology and Change Journal Editor 
Harry Keller explains that even if the necessary technology is available, 
Mars still lacks the necessary fossil fuel energy and must rely on solar and 
wind energy to power stronger water heating and industrial processes.

See mars one, page 5

The trip also has financial prob-
lems that Mars One fails to address. 
Lansdorp told CNN that the expe-
dition will need $6 billion to fund 
the first crew but refused to clarify 
how that number breaks down. 
This suggests that this estimate may 
not even cover all of the mission’s 
costs. In comparison, NASA’s latest 
Mars rover, Curiosity, required a 
much less drastic expense of $2.5 
billion. These costs included the 
spacecraft development, salaries of 
scientists, engineers and other proj-
ect workers, as well as the launch 
and operations. 

Unlike the Curiosity mission, 
Mars One will need to make multi-

ple trips, transport several teams of 
humans and support human life on 
Mars. According to Space Industry 
News, industry sources estimate the 
mission’s realized costs would be 
closer to $15–20 billion. 

Lansdorp is quick to point 
to media coverage of the 2012 
Olympics, which made $4 billion 
from broadcasts and advertise-
ments, as a reference for money 
being accessible through televised 
content. But Mars One’s reliance 
on this revenue raises red flags. 
Although Mars One expects fund-
ing from investors, private dona-
tions and astronaut application fees, 
the organization will largely rely on 
the assumption that over four mil-
lion people will tune in every time 

the show airs. This also means that 
the bulk of money to fund the proj-
ect will be coming inconsistently, 
depending on the show’s success.

The ethics of a one-way trip to 
Mars already seems wrong — an 
expedition to Mars shouldn’t be 
shaped like a reality television 
show. But Mars One’s omission of 
key details and important issues 
makes the mission unlikely to suc-
ceed. As interesting as the Mars 
One mission seems, the world may 
just be latching onto a wave of 
media hype before witnessing the 
failure of another highly anticipated 
human space mission.

Solve For X By Philip Jia LeTTer  TO  The  edITOr

Dear Editor, 
“Fontana del Tritone,” by the 

sculptor Bernini, is a masterpiece 
of the Baroque era — a representa-
tion of Neptune’s orders that Triton 
blow on his shell and sound a 
retreat to the universal deluge. 

In ancient Greek mythology, 
Zeus’ daughter Athena had already 
discussed Odysseus’ fate with her 
royal father just at the time when 
Odysseus’ enemy, nautical god 
Poseidon, was absent from Mount 
Olympus. Undercover, Athena 
visits Telemachus (Odysseus’ son) 
in Ithaca, an island located in the 
Ionian Sea, to urge him to search 
for news of his father. 

Telemachus offers hospitality, 
but she can’t enjoy the company 
of rowdy suitors enjoying their 
cups of wine, anticipating bed-
ding Odysseus’ wife (Telemachus’ 
mother) Penelope. “Return from 
Troy” was the bardic entertain-
ment scheduled for that evening. 
Penelope remonstrates — because 
it reminds her of her missing hus-
band — but Telemachus overrules 
her. The next morning, Telemachus 
calls an assembly of citizens of 
Ithaca to discuss what should be 
done with Penelope’s suitors. 

This sets up Odysseus’ return 
from 20 years of absence to slay the 
suitors. Athena’s weapon is not a 
conch shell but her shield, “Aegis.” 
And that shield has a Gorgon’s head 
on it, so that anyone who attacks 
her is inviting “a galloping case of 
rigor mortis.”

In 1621, Marie de Medicis, 
widow of Henri IV of France 
and queen mother of King Louis 
XIII, invited Peter Paul Rubens 
to Paris. As a result, the galleries 
of the new Palais de Luxembourg 

have 24 monumental paintings 
commemorating episodes in the 
lives of herself and her former 
husband. Ruben’s encyclopedic 
knowledge of classical mythology 
was exploited to the full in trans-
forming the queen’s entire career 
into a series of operatic moments. 
Metamorphosing life into myth, 
Rubens freely mingled histori-
cal personages with the gods of 
Olympus. His international fame 
came to rest on his success with 
this formidable commission (which 
was completed in only three years). 
Ruben’s solution was to populate 
his compositions with nude god-
desses, pagan gods and mischievous 
tritons. In the huge canvas, “Maria 
de Medici Landing in Marseilles,” 
for example, Charonia tritonis sea-
shells are featured.

It also has Captain Robert 
Fitzroy of the HMS Beagle: “The 
disagreeable practice alluded to 
has been permitted in most ships, 
because sanctioned by time; and 
though many condemn it as an 
absurd and dangerous piece of folly, 
it has also many advocates. [The 
conch shell’s] effects on the minds 
of those engaged in preparing for 
its mummeries, who enjoy it at the 
time, and talk of it long after wards, 
cannot easily be judged of without 
being an eyewitness.”

Additionally, according to Otto 
von Kotzebue on Oct. 11,1823, “We 
crossed the Equator. Having saluted 
the Southern hemisphere by the 
firing of guns, our crew proceeded 
to enact the usual ceremonies. An 
old man appeared as Neptune. He 
and his consort were attired in an 
imposing manner … seated on a 
gun-carriage instead of a shell … 
drawn by our crew substituting for 
Tritons.”

Where  will  you  live?
A journey off campus

Pacific  Beach
T aking up residence in Pacific Beach (a two-bedroom apart-ment averages around $1850) 
may be worth the sacrificed conve-
nience of living closer to campus. 
The beach community has given 
way to a young crowd of 20-some-
things, leading some to instantly 
envision an epitomized scene of 
drunk college students upon men-
tion of the town. 

But PB has more to offer than its 
abundance of bars and nightclubs. 
Packed along its streets, which are 
laid out on a grid in aid of the direc-
tionally challenged, are even more 
restaurants and eateries, with mul-
tiple taco shops and Mexican grills. 
A three-mile boardwalk awaits just a 
little ways down for you to walk off 
all that food. Biking or hopping on a 
beach cruiser (they’re everywhere), 

will also do the trick. 
Given the town’s accessibility, 

those without a car won’t need to 
worry about missing out on the 
many things there are to do. But 
they’ll have to deal with the 40-min-
ute commute on the San Diego Bus 
Route 30 to and from campus.

Features Editor

S nuggled between Hillcrest and Balboa Park, North Park is rockin’ away to its own hippy vibe. North 
Park garners its unique flair from an 
emphasis on local art, entertainment and 
food. Every Thursday, locals flock to the 
farmer’s market, indulging in fresh pro-
duce and delicious prepared foods.

The local restaurants in North Park 
are known for dishin’ up fresh takes on 
food classics. After a hard night of party-
ing, head on over to dive bar URBN for 
a slice of mashed potato pizza or stop by 
Carnitas’ Snack Shack for a meaty fix.  
      Along with a vibrant nightlife, North 

Park’s art scene is also colorful. Slide 
into your best hipster outfit, and shuffle 
on down to the monthly art gallery, Ray 
at Night, which features the talents of 
local artists.

North Park’s only downfall is its cam-
pus accessibility. Although it’s only 20 
minutes away from campus by car, using 
city transportation takes over an hour. 
That, and rent is expensive — ranging 
anywhere from $700 to over $1000 for a 
one-to-two-bedroom apartment.

North  Park

For about the same price you’d pay to live in La Jolla, you can gather some friends and shack 
up in Hillcrest — the hipster bor-
ough of San Diego. It’s home to the 
annual San Diego Pride Festival — 
due to its large LGBT community 
— and CityFest, one of San Diego’s 
largest street fairs.

Let’s not forget Hillcrest’s 
bumpin’ nightlife. You can try Small 
Bar on Park Avenue or venture into 
one of the many gay bars. 

Places like North Park and 
Mission Valley are also close by, ripe 
with even more nighttime activities.

Hillcrest’s tasty cuisine is anoth-
er bonus. The bustling streets are 
lined with restaurants worthy of at 
least one or two Instagram photos 
with the hashtag #foodporn. 

Some dining highlights include 
Amarin Thai, The Deli Llama sand-
wich shop and, of course, Snooze, 
a delicious a.m. eatery serving up 
food that couldn’t be further from a 

snooze fest.
Though there’s currently a shut-

tle circulating every half hour at the 
UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center, it’s 
a shame that living in Hillcrest will 
no longer be a convenient option 
for students without cars due to the 
impending transportation cuts. But 
none of these cuts are set in stone 
yet — we won’t know for certain 
about any changes until July.

HILLCREST

L ining Genesee Avenue, Canyon Park Apartments are a per-
fect fit for those without 
a car. UTC mall is only 
a 15-minute walk away, 
and if you’re ever in need 
of a double espresso shot, 
Starbucks is also within 
walking distance.

Their location also 
makes getting onto campus 
easy. The heart of the UCSD 
campus is only 1.7 miles 
away from Canyon Park 
— easily conquered with a 
skateboard or a bike. For 
those who prefer shuttling 
onto campus, the Regents 

Shuttle stop is stationed 
right across the street. But, 
because Genesee is a busy 
street, you can often hear 
the sounds of whizzing cars 
and sirens through the thin 
apartment walls.

Rent is pretty expensive 
even though the apartments 
are furnished with old 
appliances and boast a less-
than-stellar workout facility. 
A one-bedroom apartment 
costs between $1070 and 
$1130, and a two-bedroom 
pad costs $1470 to $1585.

Canyon  Park Costa  Verde
I f you’re anxious about leaving the dorms to live off campus, then Costa 
Verde is the perfect transi-
tion apartment. It’s one of the 
larger apartment complexes 
in La Jolla, with more pools 
than necessary in addition to 
a spa and gym comparable 
to 24 Hour Fitness. It’s also 
a short walk to the Arriba 
Shuttle Stop and the 201/202 
Bus Stop.

But beware — it may feel 
like you never left campus 
when you realize that all your 
fellow UCSD peers also live 
in Costa Verde. This may 
be comforting for those of 
you seeking “your kind,” but 
others may grow tired of 
seeing the same faces from 
school while riding the eleva-
tor (which is always out of 

order at the worst times) 
up to their floor. You’ll have 
to sacrifice some peaceful 
quiet with so many students 
around, but at least this 
means you can throw a party 
every once in awhile without 
receiving noise complaints. 

The rent isn’t impossible 
for a group of four room-
mates or more, averaging at 
about $1950. Some rooms 
even have an added loft to fit 
that extra fifth roommate.

Overall, though, you’ll 
be grateful for the short 
walk to McDonald’s, 
Chipotle and Five Guys. 
It’ll also be nice to not have 
to drive to late night happy 
hour at Sushi Ki.

La Jolla  Vista  Townhouses
L a Jolla Vista Townhouses is the closest place you can live to campus without dealing with RSOs and dining food, 
with a six-minute shuttle ride to cam-
pus. The neighborhood of townhouses 
is dubbed “Regents” in reference to the 
quick jaywalk it takes to get to the Regents 
Shuttle. Regents has grown to house 
almost exclusively students in Greek chap-

ters (among randomly placed families). 
The townhouses all have the kitchen awk-
wardly placed at the entryway, a spacious 
living room and three to four bedrooms 
upstairs. Each townhouse comes with a 
backyard area, which varies from a small 
slab of concrete to a garden overlooking 
the canyon. 
      The rent is in the $700 range for a 

single and around $500 if you want 
to split a master. Students congregate 
there for events like Spirit Night and 
Sun God Festival, so it may not be the 
best choice for those who’d prefer some 
peace and quiet.

La  Scala
O n the corner of Lebon and Nobel Drive — less than a five-minute walk to the Nobel Shuttle Stop — resides the 
picturesque La Scala apartments. The rent 
includes the water bill, pool, gym amenities 
and two free parking spaces, justifying the 
$1600 to $1900 rent for a two-bedroom, 
two-bathroom apartment.

The ideal location will satisfy all your 
grocery shopping needs. A short walk can 
take you to Vons, Ralphs, Trader Joes or 
Whole Foods. And more often than not, 
you’re going to opt to walk, because maneu-
vering your car in La Scala’s tightly spaced 
parking garage can easily lead to accidents.

La Scala houses a variety of people — 
from the weird, yet friendly cat lady down 
the hall, to the 80-year old couple across the 
way, to the frat boys below whose raging dub 
beats and bass vibrations continually  rever-
berate through your floor.

Though some may detect a “funky” smell 
lingering in the hallways, the La Scala main-
tenance staff is fairly helpful and will remove 
that mold growing in your bathroom for 
free. They’ll also leave polite memos on your 
door to remind you of fire alarm checks or 
water shut offs. Don’t worry, though — they 
don’t occur too often.

The managers of La Scala also own the 
La Jolla International Gardens, which is 
right next door.

Trieste

W hen it comes to the convenience of loca-tion, Regents Court 
clearly delivers. The neatly 
arranged, coffee-and-cream-
colored apartment complex 
stands directly across the street 
from the Arriba Shuttle Stop 
and 201 Bus Stop. The com-
plex is also in close proximity 
to Ralphs, Vons and UTC, 
giving those without a car the 
luxury of reaching these cen-
ters with a leisurely stroll.

Each unit within the com-
plex is relatively new. The 
cheapest of units is $1480, but 
for a higher cost (tentatively 
between $1950 and $2200), 
you can get a particularly well-

arranged and spacious unit 
among the “Santa Barbara” 
units. These are well-lit and 
nicely ventilated with two siz-
able bedrooms, each with its 
own walk-in closet. 

Below the living units, the 
decorated common area is 
complete with a cozy home 
theater, a study area and a 
pool table. 

Additionally, parking 
spaces are copious. So don’t 
worry — you won’t need to 
fight for a parking spot if you 
take your car out for an eve-
ning spin.

I f surrealist artist M.C. Escher were to design an apartment complex, 
it would probably look like 
Trieste Apartment Villas. 
The complex is infamous 
among past UCSD residents 
for its confusing layout, poor 
management and small, 
oddly shaped bedrooms — 
hence its nickname, “Triste.” 
Located on Nobel Drive, 
Trieste is built on a steep 
hill, so its narrow hallways 
are broken by short flights of 
steps roughly every 15 feet. 

Within its rooms, you 
may find arranging your 
furniture in a sensible man-
ner to be nearly impossible, 
especially if you’ve decided 
to double up. But sharing 
is recommended to help 
save your wallet pain — a 
929-square-foot, two-bed-

room apartment at Trieste 
goes for $1700 to $2100, 
comparable to a two-bed-
room at Costa Verde, which 
has bigger rooms and better 
amenities included. 

On the positive side, 
Trieste is only a two-minute 
walk away from bus stops 
that service the San Diego 
Metropolitan Transit System 
201/202 SuperLoop route 
as well as both the Nobel 
and Arriba Shuttles. It’s also 
walking distance from both 
La Jolla Village Square and 
the Westfield UTC mall. The 
complex also welcomes ten-
ants with pets. So if you can’t 
bear leaving little Marley 
behind, Trieste may be the 
right place for you.

Preparing
for success and 
the CPA exam.
Pepperdine’s Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) 

is an intensive program that prepares you for a career 

in public accounting, industry, government, and the 

nonprofi t sector. The 30-unit curriculum can be completed 

in as few as nine months and is designed for those who 

seek the academic preparation and credits required for 

CPA licensure in California and most other states.

The Master of Science in Accounting

superseded by the choco-sadness 
B-process that comes about when 
the sweet taste is over. And with 
repeated use of the stimulus over 
time, whether it be chocolate, 
rollercoasters or even cocaine, the 
initial feeling lessens while the sec-
ondary response takes over. 

In Solomon’s particular study, 
skydivers’ emotions were studied 
during and after the jump from an 
airplane. While there was an initial 
feeling of complete terror for the 
more inexperienced divers, their 
emotions turned to ecstatic relief 
and pleasure upon landing safe and 
sound on terra firma. As the divers 
did more jumps, the more plea-
surable feelings of the B-process 
started to take precedence, and the 
addiction levels started to rise. 

While this doesn’t bode so well 
for incorrigible substance addicts 
who start experiencing debilitating 
withdrawals and less intoxication with 
repeated drug use, it explains many of 
our seemingly dimwitted behaviors. 
Take the need for speed, for example. 

The thrill of driving fast is in some 
ways a response to the terrifying feel-
ing of having no control. Some people 
rejoice in having shorter travel times 
between Point A and Point B, but for 
most freeway fanatics, the subcon-
scious sensation of crossing boundar-
ies without dying causes great elation. 

This mentality is the same that 
leads edgier individuals to push the 
limits of every boundary they can 
find, such as the law. Shoplifters and 
pickpockets in particular have been 
known to feel a powerful emotional 
“rush” when they get away with minor 
thefts. In many cases, this addictive 
reaction provides them greater satis-
faction than do the stolen items, lead-
ing to chronic stints of crime. 

So the next time you’re peering 
over the precipitous edge of a ridicu-
lous coaster at Six Flags with your 
life flashing before your eyes, decide 
whether that gut-wrenching drop 
and moment of sheer primal terror 
is worth that surge of post-traumatic 
exhilaration. There are nearly end-
less options of dumb things you can 
do to get your B-process fix. Just 
don’t try them at home.

Track Shines at Triton InvitationalTritons Win WWPA Tournamnet
Tritons finish regular season at Annual Triton Invitational, prepare for CCAAs.

Sophomore Sabrina Pimentel and 
freshman Kristin Sato both took first 
place in their respective events last 
week in the Triton Invitational, host-
ed by UCSD at the Triton Track & 
Field Stadium. Pimentel — last sea-
son’s California Collegiate Athletics 
Association Freshman of the Year — 
took first in the 800 meters, finishing 
with a time of 2:11.51, while Sato took 
first in the triple jump (39’4.5”). The 
Tritons came away with some good 
results in its last meet of the regular 
season before the CCAA conference 
championships. 

Currently, UCSD has 16 provision-
al qualifiers, nine women and seven 
men. In the 800 meters, Pimentel and 
junior Lorato Anderson both have 
provisional qualifiers, and in the triple 
jump, Sato and sophomore Chantia 
Justice have both made the cut. On the 
men’s side, UCSD keeps with its tradi-
tion of strong throwers. Sophomore 
Nash Howe and redshirt senior Kiley 
Libuit both have provisionals in the 
javelin and seniors Zach Nagengast 
and A.B. Shaheen both qualify for the 
hammer throw.

“The team did great,” Assistant 
Coach and Triton Invitational par-
ticipant Nick Howe said. “They were 
all getting pretty good marks. The 
Triton Invite is good for tuning up for 
the most important meet of the year, 
and we looked really good this past 
weekend.” All of the aforementioned 
performed well at their home track. 
Nagengast threw a career best 169’4”, 
to move into 16th in the nation in dis-
cus, while Nash Howe finished fourth 
with a throw of 208’. On the women’s 
side, Anderson recorded a personal 
best in the 800 meters.

But it was the Triton alumni who 
stole the show over the course of the 
three-day weekend. Kelly Fogarty — 
2011 alumna, representing Movin 
Shoes, a local athletic footwear compa-
ny — won first place in the 100-meter 
dash and 200-meter dash. Jacqueline 
Rose — ranked 51st in the world and 
also a UCSD alumna and Movin Shoes 
representative — won the 400-meter 
dash, two seconds in front of second 
place, and Stephanie LeFever — 2011 
alumnus — won the long jump. On 
the men’s side Nick Howe — 2012 
alumnus — and older brother to Nash 
Howe, took first in the javelin.

“[Movin Shoes] is a team where 
athletes can compete and train and 
try and make that jump from being a 
good college athlete and an elite ath-
lete,” Howe said.

The Tritons will now take part 
in the CCAA Championships in 
Turlock, Calif. at the Al Brenda Track 

at Warrior Stadium this Thursday 
through Saturday, May 2 to May 4. 
Chico State has won the conference 
on both the men’s and women’s sides 
for the past three seasons.  

“The men’s team is really strong 
this year,” Howe said. “I think we’re 
gonna be up there, and we’re gonna 
be looking to win. We’ll be happy with 
second place, but this year we have a 
lot more coverage in the throws and in 
the distance, so this could be the first 
year that we win.” 

Howe said the women also have 
a good shot at finishing strong at 
conference.

“The women are really young 
this year, but have a couple of out-
standing athletes, particularly 
in [Pimentel] and shotputter Eva 
Isaacs,” Howe said.

The No. 13 UCSD Women’s Water 
Polo team won the Western Water 
Polo Association Championships last 
weekend, April 26 to April 28. The 
Tritons, who won the regular season 
title, going 8–0 in conference play, 
took three straight wins to claim the 
title. On Friday, UCSD won 14–1 
over Cal State San Bernardino. The 

following day, the Tritons took a 14–6 
win over Colorado State and beat 
Loyola Marymount in the champion-
ship game 10–8.

With the win, UCSD earns 
the automatic bid to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Women’s Water Polo Championships, 
May 10 to May 12, hosted by 
Harvard. The eight-team field will be 
announced Monday, April 29.

The UCSD baseball team played 
its final two home games this past 
week against Cal State San Bernardino. 
The Tritons played a four-game series 
against their California Collegiate 
Athletic Association opponents in a 
home and away series. UCSD split the 
home games but finished strong with 
back-to-back victories in a Saturday 
doubleheader to take the series 3–1. 

In its last home game of the sea-
son, UCSD honored eight graduating 
seniors: Danny Susdorf, Scott Liske, 
Richard Seigel, Ryan Goodbrand, 
Richard Kilbury, Sam Michaels, James 
Mossholder and Jonah Northrop.

“It’s crazy — time flies really quick,” 
Susdorf said of his senior season. “It 
was kind of hard there playing at the 
end, realizing that the innings were 
ticking down, but I’ve had a great four 

years here; it’s been a blast. UCSD has 
offered so many opportunities, and 
I’m just thankful for everything that 
they’ve done.”

UCSD has one more regular season 
series before wrapping up conference 
play. The Tritons (25–21 overall, 19–17 
in the CCAA) will head up north to 
face No. 12 Cal State Monterey Bay on 
the road, Friday, May 3 to Sunday, May 
5. It has yet to be seen whether UCSD 
will qualify for the four-team CCAA 
tournament the following weekend, 
but what’s definite is that this last regu-
lar season series will be crucial.

Game 1: Thursday, April 25  UCSD 
7, Cal State San Bernardino 3

Cal State San Bernardino jumped 
ahead in the first inning, but UCSD 
evened the game in the fourth when 
junior transfer Dillon Moyer scored 
on a throwing error by the Coyote 
shortstop. 

Triton pitcher Ryan Goodbrand 
kept the Tritons close, only allow-
ing two more runs in the sixth on a 
pair of runs batted in singles to left 
field. Goodbrand pitched solid overall, 
going seven innings and giving up just 
three runs in the winning effort. 

The Tritons did most of their dam-
age in the seventh inning off four 
hits, including an RBI double for 
third baseman Garrett Tuck and a 
pair of RBI singles for juniors Justin 
Rahn and Liske to score four runs. 

UCSD added two more runs in 
the eighth. Catcher Nick La Face 
singled to score Tuck, and Rahn 
brought home La Face with a single. 
Rahn went 4-for-5 in the game, with 
a pair of RBI. 

Game 2: Friday, April 26 UCSD 
2, Cal State San Bernardino 4

In the second game of the series, 
both starting pitchers had stellar 
performances. 

Triton starter Blake Fassler went 
seven innings, only giving up three 
hits and two earned runs in the 
outing. Coyote starter Kerry Kelley 
went eight and gave up two. 

Neither team scored until the 
top of the third, when Cal State 
San Bernardino’s Christian Gomez 
doubled to lead off the inning and 

was brought home on a grounder to 
third. The Coyotes added another 
in the fifth off a home run by left-
fielder Remington Miller.

UCSD was held scoreless until 
the sixth inning but got on the 
board when Seigel singled to center 
field for an RBI. 

Both teams added runs in the 
eighth, with the Coyotes striking 
first by rallying to score two runs. 
UCSD appeared to be in line for a 
large inning, loading the bases with 
no one out, but were only able to 
score one run on a past ball thrown 
by the pitcher. 

Neither team mustered any runs 
in the final frame, and the score of 
4–2 held to tie the series at one game 
apiece.

Game 3: Saturday April 27 UCSD 
11, Cal State San Bernardino 4

UCSD brought its bats in their 
first game at Fiscalini Field, scoring 
11 runs in the campaign.

The Tritons got their offense 
going right away, scoring two in the 
first inning, and picked up two more 
in the third. UCSD added another 
run in the sixth when Susdorf sin-
gled to score Brett Levy, who was 
hit by a pitch to lead off the inning. 

Catcher La Face hit a home run 

in the seventh to score two runs, 
which contributed to a four-run 
Triton inning. Two more Tritons 
crossed the plate in the ninth, as 
sophomore Ho-Kyun Choi singled 
to drive in a run and Mossholder hit 
a sacrifice fly ball to record an RBI. 

UCSD capitalized on seven 
Coyote errors in the game, scoring 
six unearned runs. 

Game 4: Saturday, April 27 UCSD 
16, Cal State San Bernardino 5

The Tritons followed up an 
11-run effort by scoring 16 in the 
second game of the doubleheader. 

UCSD wasted no time putting 
runs on the board, dropping four 
on the Coyotes to begin the game. 
They repeatedly had large innings, 
scoring three in the third, four in 
the fourth, and five in the sixth. 

Right-fielder Scott Liske had a 
monster game for the Tritons, going 
4-for-5 and driving in six runs, 
highlighted by a three-run home 
run in the fourth. Rahn homered to 
right center field in the fifth, driv-
ing in three runs of his own. Danny 
Susdorf led off for the Tritons, going 
3-for-4 and scoring four runs.

UCSD Takes Series 3-1
UCSD Baseball takes down Cal State San Bernardino in 
home and away series, honor Tritons on senior night.

BY  MATT SM ITH  EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

The UCSD Softball team went 3–1 against Chico State last week to maintain its No. 2 seed going into the California Collegiate 
Athletics Association tournament.

“I think our team had a really strong weekend,” 
junior pitcher Jennifer Manuel said. “Our offensive 
game was strong, and our outfield was amazing 
against Chico.”

The Tritons end their regular season with a 
24–12 conference record, seven games behind first 
place Humboldt State and two games in front of 
third place Sonoma State. Cal State Dominguez 
(21–15) just edged out Chico State over the weekend 
to claim the last spot in the four-team tournament.   
With the second seed, UCSD will face No. 3 seed 
Sonoma State this Friday, May 3 at Arnaiz Stadium 
in Stockton, Calif. in the first round of the tourna-
ment. The last time the two teams met was back in 
February, when the Tritons split with the Seawolves. 

“We played them really early in the season when 
we were just getting used to each other,” Manuel 
said. “Now our team is closer than ever, and I think 
we’re expecting a really hard game, but we’re gonna 
come out strong. [Sonoma’s] always tough, but we’re 
excited to play them.”

Game 1: April 26 UCSD 5, Chico State 4: The 
Tritons took the lead at the top of the first inning on 
a triple from junior Kirsten Willmon, to score fresh-
man Callie Grant — hitting in the two-hole. The 

Wildcats equalized in the second inning and went 
up 2–1 in the third. In the fourth inning, Chico State 
extended their lead, capitalizing on two errors to 
pick up two more runs. The Tritons took two more 
back in the fifth inning when Grant and Willmon 
made their way to third and second, respectively. 
With two outs junior Mya Romero doubled to left 
field for two RBI.

Junior righthander Jennifer Manuel loaded the 
bases in the bottom of the fifth, but fought her way 
out of it, as the Wildcats stranded three men on base. 
Manuel kept Chico scoreless in the sixth, giving the 
Tritons room to take the lead in the seventh, when 
Sepulveda scored off an unearned run.

Game 2: April 26 UCSD 1, Chico State 
0: Sophomore Taylor Sepulveda singled through 
the right side, was moved to second on a sacrifice 
bunt and stole third. With one out, the redshirt 
sophomore was brought home on a popup from 
Willmon. The Tritons made the most of its one run. 
Sophomore Kayla Hensel (10–6) held Chico at bay, 
allowing just one hit in her seven innings on the 
mound. 

Game 3: April 27 Chico State 3, UCSD 0: Chico 
State used a three-run second inning to secure the 
win over the Tritons in the first game of the double-
header last Saturday. 

The Wildcats took advantage of two costly Triton 
fielding errors in the second inning, to score three 

runs off two hits off sophomore slinger Michelle 
Escamilla (3–11). Escamilla was brought off in favor 
of Manuel in the third inning, but the damage was 
already done, and the Tritons put up very little in the 
way of offense for the remainder of the game.  

Game 4: April 27 UCSD 8, Chico State 2: The 
Tritons brought their bats in the last game of the 
series. UCSD scored its first run in the top of the 
second off, as senior Nicole Spangler (3-for-2 in 
game four) doubled to left field to drive in freshman 
designated player Katie Saunders. 

Up 1–0 in the fourth inning, freshman McKenna 
Clewett struck a double to bring home Saunders 
and Spangler. Chico State looked to stem the bleed-
ing, replacing pitcher Alex Molina with a fresh arm 
in Kayla McConnell, but the Tritons didn’t let up. 
With Clewett on second and Sepulveda on first, the 
two made use of their pace, advancing to third and 
second respectively. McConnell then walked her 
next two batters to score Clewett. With bases loaded, 
Romero doubled to left center for three RBI. Chico 
replaced McConnell with Brooke Langeloh, who 
gave up one more run before ending the inning. 

Chico took back two runs — one in the fourth 
and one in the fifth — but was unable to cut the 
deficit further.

Scouting Sonoma State

The Tritons will face No. 3 seed Sonoma State this weekend in the first round of the California Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. UCSD has only faced 
Sonoma State once this season, splitting the four-game series with the Seawolves. Sonoma State has one of the most dangerous pitchers in the league in Samantha 
Lipperd. The Sonoma ace is fourth in the conference for ERA (1.96), wins (20) leads the conference in strikeouts (211). The Seawolves have also proven themselves 
offensively. Sonoma is second in the season in runs (235) and hits (437) and leads the CCAA in batting average (.314).
