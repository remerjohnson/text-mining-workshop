A campus attorney has warned 
YouCSD.com that it may face pos-
sible legal chalJengesfrom the uni-
versity for its name. The Web site, 
which features blog-format cover-
age of officials, students and cam-
pus events, is operated by an 
anonymous group of university 
undergraduates. 

The site, which contains the let-
ters "UCSD" in its hyperlink, is in 
violation of California's education 
code, which RServes the 
"University of California" name as 
the property of the stllte, campus 
counsel Ann Parode said. According 
to the regulation, the name may not 
be use6 without the pennission of 
the UC Board of Regents.

Though the site's creators 
agreed to remove the photo on 
Oct. 5 after tallcs with the univer-
sity, they said they were disap-
pointed with the state's copyright 
laws and the "bizarre enent to 
which they can be manipulated." 

"It seems pretty ridiculous that 
they can exert such control over a 
photograph of a public building 
that we took ourselves," the site's 
creators said in an anonymous e-
mail statement.

UCSD trails only UC Santa 
Cruz in the number of judicial 
referrals for alcohol violations 
issued to students on UC campus-
es, according to the most recent 
statistics compiled by the U .S. 
Department of Education. In 2002, 
the last year reponed, UCSD 
recorded 1,051 alcohol infractions, 
while UC Santa Cruz reported 
1,234. 

By comparison, UC Riverside 
reported the fewest violations, with 
98, just below the 101 disciplinary 
actions at UC Davis. 

However, while the records 
indicate that the campus has a con-
sUka,bU: vialation rate, this does

riences a much highe~qr of 

. ~ lUegal drinking, _ ac¢06ling,· to 
Director of Student Poficiesand 
Judicial Affairs Nicholas S. 
Aguilar. 

"It's not that we have more 
activity, bu~ our method of track-
ing and compiling incidents is 
much more detailed than other 
schools," Aguilar said. "[The sta-
tistics] make us look like we are 
experiencing a higher number of 
incidents, when in fact it's not 

true. UCSD reports all incidents 
in residence halls and elsewhere 
through the campus police 
department ... Other campuses 
separate their statistics into non-
student, ... criminal [and further] 
categories." 

Even after accounting for vari-
ations in population size, UCSD 
still posted a higher number of 
infractions per each 1,000 stu-
dents than San Diego State 
University, UC Santa Barbara and 
Chico State - known among stu-
dents for their social scenes -
according to the department fil-
ings. 

At UCSD, 43.6 students out of 
every 1,000 received referrals, 
compared to 13.2 at San Diego 
State, 37.8 at UC Santa Barbara 
and 43.1 at Chico State. The cam-
pus ratio is also nearly twice that of 
the State University of New York at 
Albany - recendy named by the 
Princeton Review as the "Top Party 
School of 2004." 

Excluding UC Santa Cruz and 
UC Santa Barbara, UCSD's rate is 
also greater than the total number 
of violations at all the other UC 
campuses combined.

The partnership between the 
A.S. Council and Housing and 
Dining Services to provide 
"Dining Dollar" access at Grove 
Caffe has come to an end, both 
parties said. 

In the spring of last year, the 
two groups decided to bring the 
service to the cafe as part of an 
experiment that allowed non-
Housing and Dining Service facil-
ities to process the type of curren-
cy created by the department. 
After talks between former A.S. 
Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan and 
Director of Housing and Dining 
Services Mark Cunningham, both 
sides decided to institute the pro-
gram on a trial basis, with die 
agreement set to expire at the end 
of the 2003~04 academic year. 

Now, the current A.S. Council 
and A.S. Commissioner of 
Enterprise Operations Angela 
F ornero must assess the success of 
the program and decide whether 
the agreement should be renewed. 
Among the items under considera-
tion is the effect of the program on

ing that while many cash cus-

tomers left loose change for the 
employees, customers paying with 
meal points rarely left a tip. 

Cogan, Fomero and Bellshaw 
said they have fears that the 
increased workload could hurt

I BRIEFLY 
Two UC science professors 

win Nobel Prizes 
The Royal Swedish Academy of Science 

awarded its prestigious Nobel Prize to two UC 
professors. The most recent announcements, 
made one day apart, bring the total number of 
Nobel Prizes awarded to UC researchers to 16 
since 1995. 

The academy recognized David Gross, a 
UC Santa Barbara phYSICS professor and direc-
tor of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, 
for his role in the discovery of a mathematical 
model for the atomic "strong force: one of 
four fundamental forces of nature. 

His work has brought scientists one step 
closer to formulating Na unified theory for 
everything." said the academy in a statement 
explaining that Gross is one of the founders of 
the current understanding of the "standard 
model" for a nucleus. 

Gross, who received his doctorate from 
UC Berke!ey, will share the prize with two 
other reseflrchers who studied the same the-
ory. The award is based on Gross' 1973 work 
performed while teaching at Princeton 
University. 

The academy also awarded its chemistry 
prize to UC Irvine researcher Irwin Rose for his 
cCHliscovery of the way cells destroy unwanted 
proteins. Rose will share the prize with two 
other scientists. 

Conducted in the late 19705 and early 
1980s, the research is credited with providing 
the basis leading to the creation of new thera-
pies to treat diseases like cervical cancer and 
cystic fibrosis. 

Rose's award marks the fifth time in the last 
decade that UC faculty have won the Nobel 
Prize in chemistry. 

The awards underscore "the major contri-
butions that research universities make to our 
understanding of the world: UC President 
Robert. C Dynes said in a statement 

Animal rights group to hold 
candlelight vigil 

Animal rights activists plan to gather at the 
Salk Institute for Biological Studies on Oct. 8 for 
a candleliRht vigil to commemorate National 
Primate Li6eration Week. 

The activists plan to showcase graphic 
photos depicting types of animal experi-
ments conducted at the institute in an 
attempt to draw public attention to the 
almost 100,000 primates that have been 
killed during the course of experiments at 
U.s. laboratories. 

They hope that the event will force the pub-
lic to demand better treatment of animals and

CongresS votes for HEA 
temporary funding measure 

In a temporary funding measure intended 
to support govemment operations through 
Nov. 20, Congress induded a provision to 
extend the terms of the 1998 Higher 
Education Pd. 

Because the law requires Congress to reau-
thorize the act every five years, the temporary 
move will keep it from expiring. 

The measure, known as a continuing res-
olution, authorizes federal a8encies to oper-
ate all programs and activities at the same 
levels as in the 2004 fiscal year, but general-
ly does not allow the launching of any new 
programs. 

Though the resolution was eKpected, 
American Council on Education Director of 
Govemment Relations Becky Timmons said 
the delay will allow for lesislators te wait until 
after the November election to avoid approv-
ing "the harsh provisions" of the 2005 bud-
get. 

Funding plans currently before lawmakers 
would keep the maKimum PelI Grant at S4,050 
for the third consecutive year.

Poll: Youth prefer Bush 
over Kerry for president 

I A.S. (O~CIL AT A GLANCE 
. A Harris Interactive poll has found that kids 

and teenagers aged eight to 18 would rather 
vote for President George W. Bush than for 
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) by a H)-point mar-
gin. 

In a similar poll in August respondents pre-
ferred Kerry (1.Jer Bush bY a six-point margin. 

Though the poll showed that both boys and 
girls picked Bush over Kerry by similar margins, 
older teenagers between 16 and 18 favor 
Kerry. 

Historically, the polls of children have had "a 
remarkable track record at predicting presiden-
tial elections outcomes: stated John Geraci, 
vice president of youth research at Harris 
Interactive. 

In addition, kids responding to the poll gave 
Bush a 54-percent job approval rating and said 
they believed he would do a better job than 
Kerry at making the world safer for children and 
improving education. They gave Kerry the edge 
for helping poor children and families.

AlCohol: UCSD ahead of top 
party school in violation referrals 

cONinutd from ". I 
UCSD feU by 25 in 2003, to a total 
of 1,026 recorded infractions. 
according to UCSD police depan-
ment records. 

Like Aguilar. Revelle College 
Resident Dean Kevin Jones said 
the numbers overstate the relative 
number of campus violations as 
compared to other schools. 

"I believe we have fewer overall 
incidents than other campuses but 
are better able to identify and doc-
ument the ones we do have 
because we see what is occurring 
on campus better than other 
schools." he said. 

Jones also said that the majority 
of srodents who have been cited 
generally do not commit another 
transgression. 

"At Revelle Residential Life. we 
have many 6m-time offenses, few 
second-time offenses. and very 
rarely does a student reach the 
third violation; he said. 

If university ' officials catcb 
underage students drinking on 
campus. regulations require them 
to attend a mandatory alcohol pre-
vention and educAtion workshop. 
Aguilar said. 

John Muir College Resident 
Dean Pat DanylyshYn-Adams said 
UCSD may monitor for potential 
violators more actively than other 
campuses. 

"It is my understanding that, on 

some campuses. there is a defini-
tion of 'private space' which deter-
mines where the policy is enforced. 
even if students are under 21 years 
(of agel," Danylyshyn-Adams said. 
"At UCSD. not only. do we have 
resident advisors who enforce poli-
cy, [but) housing [officials) hire res-
idential security officers who are 
there to provide service and pro-
tection [and] are also present to 
enforce policy." 

According to Jones. students 
found to be in violation of alcohol 
policy are referred to a university 
official. 
. The official either meets with 
the student informally to resolve 
the case or sends them to a formal 
hearing before a student board that 
detennines if the srodent is guilty. 
The board also decides on appro-
priate punitiw measures for guilty 
srodents. 

"UCSD has strong alcohol-
abuse ... prevention programs and 
strategies effective in educating 
students on the effects of alcohol 
and substance abuse," Aguilar said. 
"We want students to know there 
are many alternatives to the use of 
alcohol - we are assertive in pro-
viding activities on campus that can 
be fun and don't focus on or pro-
mote alcohol."

Many are blameworthy 
• In CO,op controversy 

A s complicated as the current co-op mess 
may seem, one thing 

is certain - there is plenty 
of blame to go around. At 
the center of the current 
con troversy, however, 
remain Associated Students 
and the Graduate Student 
Association. 

A decade ago, these 
groups agreed to develop a 
lease with the university 
and then craft subleases 
with the individual co-ops. 
When the original tease, 
known as the Master Space 
Agreement, and the sub-
lease, the Memorandwn of 
Understanding, expired in 
1998, the university agreed 
to two-year extensions. 

Last year, when their 
lease with the university 
expired, Associated Students 
and the Graduate Student 
Association prematurely 
approved a two-}'ear exten-
sion for their subleases with 
the co-ops before extending 
their agreement with the 

university. When university 
officials refused to renew the 
agreement, they found 
tliemselves leasing space that 
they no longer controlled. 

By acting prematurely, 
Associated Students and ilie 
Graduate Student 
Association have recklessly 
put the future of the cam-
pus co-ops in a legal limbo, 
as they face possible evic-
tion in a matter of weeks. 

But the culpability is not 
theirs alone. Campus 
administrators let down the 
very students whose own 
self-approved referendum 
dollars are paying for the 
expansion of the university 
centers. Through interac-
tion on the Co-op Oversight 
Committee, officials should 
have made clear their inten-
tion to renegotiate the uni-
versity's deal with the gov-
erning bodies in time to 
avoid the current fiasco. 

In the meantime, the co-
ops are the victims of this 
failure in communication. 

Students should realize 
election's importance 

With the first states reaching their voter 
registration dead-

lines this week, election offi-
cials are happily reporting 
vast increases In the number 
of potential voters, according 
to the Nw York TImes. Many 
credit the efforts of indepen-
dent and partisan voter regis-
tration drives; others cite a 
swing-state mentality that 
prompts more voters to reg-
Ister in crucial election states. 

Hopefully, this mentality 
will extend to nonswing 
Califc;>rnia, where voters 
have until ·Oct. 18 to regis-
ter. If it does, it will be a wel-
come harbinger of the 
importance of the upcoming 
election, with many impor-
tant issues on the national 
stage. Moreover, if the surge 
in voter registration branch-
es into that ever-aR3thetic, 
vote-rocking bloc of 18- to 
24-year-oldS this year, we 
will know that we have a spe-

cial election on our hands. 
Thankfully, there are 

already many indicators 
that it will, with sex-themed 
voter registration cam-
paigns and pop-culture 
!cons bringing young voters 
mto the fray. Even on our 
politically docile campus, 
activist groups and the likes 
of speakers and pundits AI 
Fraiiken and Peter Migl!el 
Camejo have brought the 
election to students and, 
with any luck, kindled some 
interest. 

And why not? With 
tuition levels, emplo~ent 
rates and the fate of the 
nation's troops in Iraq - 80 
percent of whom are under 
35 - all contested election 
territory, our generation's 
stake in this election is high 
indeed. College students, at 
UCSD and elsewhere, must 
recognize this and join the 
growing rolls of potential 
voters nationwide.

C liches are, by de6nition, aite and overused expressions or situations. If there was a guide to cliches, some qualifying entries might

which is most commonly heard &om the clueless

the idea of an Wlpredictable and sometimes ruthless

least defendiDr them, if not filhan, to mUe 
sure they stay OD c:ampua. Not alf studems 
seem to realiu that the co-ops are student-
run businases tblt aist for the sole purpose 
of serving lIS, the students, and we wiD be 
the ones to suffer if the co-ops are given the 
boot. 

The co-ops' reason for existence is to 
proride valuable services to studenlS, liIIe 
school supplies, textbooks and food - aU at 
cheaper prices than university-run stores. 
1iy squeezing into the Food 
Co-op at lunch time and it 

maD more money by sivinI co-op IpKe to 
I c:orporate outlet lib McDonald's. 

nc.e are the ermanic: realities; the by 
paint is that it's in the univenity'l best ec0-
nomic iDterat to kick the co-opt out. but it's 
ill the mxleDts' best interest to cootiDue 
eIIjoyinJ their coaveDieDce and low prices. 

Admittedly, some of UCSD's co-opt -
most DOCIIbIy Grouodwork Boob and the 
CW Cafe - alienate SODIC students by 
c:hampioning a radic:ll politic:al 1genda. The 
students who run these two co-ops are enti-
tled to their individual politic:s, of c:ourse, 
but they would set more business and build 
I better reputation IDmg their clientele by 
.. their manapments' political beliefs I r. promiDent role. Remember, though, 

that this c:hanc:teristic only 
.' Ippties to two indmdual cCHlpl 

should be obvious that it's suc-
ceeding pndIy in this regard. 
Furthermore, the co-ops pr0-
vide enterprising students with 
ezperience in nmning busi"ell-
es because they are ezdusMJy 
student-nm; the otinction of 

PRO and shouldn't be coostrued as an inherent flaw of the co-op sys-tem. Perhaps I better eumple is the Gcnen.l Store, whic:h is the 
only entity OD c:ampus that sells 
cigarettes and also sells tat-
boob to compete with UCSD the co-opt would sipaJ the 

demise of many student jobs and of a unique 
job opportunity. 

Until now, the university has offered the 
co-ops a sweetheart deal by renting them 
SJIICe It 20 times below market value, and 
this generosity indirectly benefits students; 
since the co-ops are enjoying such cheap 
rent, they can Ifford to sell their products at 
cheaper prices and still surviw: as businesses. 
It's no ac:c:ident thlt the General Store C0-
op sells books at cheaper prices than UCSD 
Bookstore and that lunch at the Food Co-op 
is massively cheaper than lunch at any uni-
versity-run eatery. The co-ops are less about 
making I profirlnd more about keeping siU~ 
dents happy, and their overhead is low. 

At the same time, the pampering that the 
co-ops have received thus far is their para-
mount weakness; the university c:ouJd easily

higher 

Boobtore. Monopolies are bad and compe-
tition is soocJ, and the General Store's tut-
book business is semng the purpoee of 
keeping UCSD Bookstore on its toes. 
Students can Ilways buy tutboob else-
where, but the ~neral Store offen many 
textbooks It a convenient location and It 
prices lower than UCSD Bookstore. 

In essenc:e, the only fault of the co-ops 
is that they tend to appear to put more 
stoc:k into promoting political agendas 
than serving students, a mistake thlt ends 
up alienating many students and c:Iouding 
the co-ops' student-run, student-friendly 
nature. StiD, in light of the current situa-
tion, it's necessary to look beyond the "hip-
pie" stereotype of our co-ops and appreci-
ate the fact that students stand to lose if 
they are evicted.

YOU are I UCSD student. You're paying hundreds of doIllJ'I in activity fees. Now, whic:h of the foUowinJ are you 
most Iibly to make use of: RIMAe, Slqun 
OIl the Chi Cafe? Which of the following are 
you more likely to buy groceries &om: 
Ralph's, Costco or the Food CcHJp? The 
truth is, if you're like the vast majority of 
UCSD students, you probably work out at 
RIMAC (if so indined), dine in Price Center 
when forc:ed to eat on c:ampus and buy your 
books &om UCSD Bookstore of Half.com. 
AI fashionable as it is to revile authority, the 
on-c:ampus facilities run or contracted out 
by the university provide 
many more useful services to 

Student Center It greatly reduced rent. Such 
bnsinesle5 c:ould euiIy be required to pass on 
their . to the students, would provide 
the sa~-cost 5Cn'ic:es to students and 
probably appeal to a greater cross section of 
the c:ampus c:ommunity. 

Granted, the co-ops are a soW'ce of inde-
pendent thought, spontaneous musical per-
fonnanc:es and invallllble work experience 
via the opportunity for students to run their 
own business. Learning outside the class-
room is as important - if not more so - as 
learning in the c:Ilssroom. 50 students 
should always have the opportunity to devel-
op the independent initiative that they'll 
need to suc:c:eed later in life. But is it really 
worth it to deprive the vast majority of stu-

dents of potentially valuable and 
desirable student services so that 

students than student-run c0-
ops. Given the imbroJlio they 
are currently mired in, the 
university, Associlted 
Studeots and the Graduate 
Student Assoc:iltion should 

(ON the few can reap the bene6ts of the co-op system? The favorable treabDent they've received &om the university seems especially 
disproportionate when compared 

seriously rec:onsider devotinJ 
significant campus resources 
to student-run organizations that serve only 
I minute portion of the student body. 

Certainly. the c:o-ops do provide some 
useful semc:es to students in the form of 
cheaper food, cheaper boob and entertain-
ment. But the reason they are able to do so is 
the sweet lease agreement they have with the 
university through Associated Students and 
the Graduate Student Asoc:iation: The c0-
ops pay only S pen:ent of the markn value of 
their rent. 1bis allows them to operate with a 
signi6cantly lower O\'eI'head than other cam-
pus enterprises and essentially c:onstitutes a 
subsidy from the university. However, there's 
no reason that more affordable goods and 
services have to be provided throush the co-
ops. H it so chose, UCSD could easily find 
loc:al restaurants or businesses willing to open 
stores in prime UCSD locations such as 

to the university's relltive indif-
ferenc:e to other student orpniu-
tions that also proride students 

with valuable real-world aperienc:es. For 
aample, Student-RWl Television provides 
students with the chance to produce, direct 
and star in their own television shows and 
movies. Yet SRTV im't given nearly the 
independenc:e the co-ops have and must rely 
on Associated Students for funding. 

To provide students with job opportuni-
ties, cheap food or music perfo~es, the 
university doesn't need to support the co-
ops, which ha~ shown themselves to be 
unable to provide services that. appeal to 
more than a minority of students. While 
students should admire the passion and ded-
iation of the many students whose tireless 
effons keep the co-ops running, the admin-
istration should also realize that most stu-
dents just don't care and would much prefer 
the comforts of a nice, traditional restaurant.

It's all enough to 
make you want to 
get up and shout, "I

However, I don't

The aforementioned Career 
Services Center conducted a survey 
of sample graduates of 2003 that 
revealed that 36 percent of post-
grad jobs were an extension of or 
related to previous internship expe-
rience. Which means going pro 
bono as a junior at the company 
right now might lead to a full-time 
position later on. Also, 8 percent of 
jobs - much more than I expected 
- were obtained through a job fair 
such as those held on campus. 

Students who have had minima1 
experience in applying and inter-
viewing for such positions may find 
it helpful to prepare by jotting

some companies 
value that kind of candor, so it helps 
to spend some time mulling over 
what you've learned from past work-
places and classes and how it has 
shaped YOU as a person, etc., etc. 

It is a jungle out there, and 
even being armed with a UCSD 
B.S. or B.A. might not fend off the 
fears and expectations that 
descend the moment you get that 
diploma. Sometimes, I'd really just 
rather read a magazine or play 
Texas Hold 'Em all day and forget 
about the imminent future that is 
at my doorstep. At some point, 
though, senior~ like myself just 
have to bid adieu to college, 
embrace their mix of skills and for-

"Even if it would mean more 
revenue for us, we want employees 
to be happy," Fomero said. 

The new agreement will also 
have to address the costs incurred 
by Housing and Dining Services, 
according to Cunningham. 

Although the trial program was 
partially subsidized by the depan-
ment, Cunningham said he will be 
unable to continue absorbing the 
incurred costs. Though the prob-
lems need to be addressed, 
Cunningham said he welcomes dis-
cussions with the A.S. Council. 

"I have no problem reopening 
discussions on this as a concept . .. . 
It's all part of the journey of nego-
tiating a deal that works for my res-
idents, the Grove and my opera-
tion," he said. 

During the trial, customers 
seemed to respond positively to the 

program, despite higher prices for 
those paying with meal points, 
Cogan said. 

Bellshaw said he was surprised 
by the increase in the number of

first- and second-year students who 
frequented Grove Caffe when meal 
points were accepted. Many of the 
cafe's established customers are 
older students, teaching assisunts 
and professors, but the acceptance 
of meal points appealed to students 

living on campus, according to 
Bellshaw. 

"We weren't quite ready for it, 
because we were a small coffee 
shop with a large influx [of cus-
tomers)," he said. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Eli Tirosh said she 
began to patronize Grove Cafre 
once she discovered it accepted 
meal points. 

"Now that they're not accepting 
dining dollars, I'm not really going 
to come here anymore," Trrosh said. 

According to Cogan, the A.S. 
Council, whic~ is partially respo~­
sible for runrung Grove Caffe, IS 
losing customers to private busi-
nesses like the Art of Espresso cart 
and needs to continue expanding 
its services to compete. 

"Associated Students absolutely 
needs to innovate the enterprises or 
we're going to lose them," he said.

Grant: Agency cuts 2004 maximum award

network up and down the West 
Coast [to send the information] 
over the Internet," Ramsey said. 

According to Ramsey, most of 
the work to be done on the 
UCSD campus has to do with the 
part of the network located on 
land, which will be high-speed 
and allow researchers to use the 
data . 

CAL (Inl, led by director 
Larry Smarr, will be involved with 
"hard technology," such as the net-
working of the research institu-
tions, while SIO will be more high-
ly involved with the "application 
side," Ramsey said. 

The NSF eliminated the 

award's "large," "medium" and 
"small" class sizes used in past 
years and has instead awarded 
midrange grants because of limit-
ed Information Technology 
Research funds this year, the 
agency's Web site said. It gave 
away most of the approximately 
SI billion dollars appropriated for 
the 6ve-yea~ project during its 
first four years, leaving little for 
2004. 

It imposed the new rules after 
' two years in which UCSD 
received the agency's largest 
grants. In 2002, the campus was 
awarded S12.5 million. The year 
after, the NSF gave a joint S I 2 
million grant to the university and 

UC Irvine. 
"There was S130 million left to 

hand out and rather than giving 
each project $12 [million] to $13 
million dollars, they decided to 
give everyone at least some money, 
so they lowered the maximum 
amount to $3 .9 million dollars," 
Ramsey said. 

The third consecutive year of 
awards from the agency highlights 
the campus' expertise in the subject 
area, according to Ramsey. 

"We are one of the top institu-
tions in the nation for information 
technology," he said.

Site: Students' 
identities still 

unknoWn, 
lawyer says 

continued from page r 
Though their names are 

unknown, Parode said she is cur-
rendy communicating with the 
students via e-mail. 

"As long as they comply I don't 
care [who they are)," she said. 

Parade is not currendy taking 
action against other Internet sites 
that use the university's acronym, 
such as MeetUCSD.com, which is 
advertised on the GJIIIJ"dilm Web 
site. The GrumiiIl1l hyperIink also 
includes the university's acronym. 
The decision to pursue 
YouCSD.com, Parode said, was not 
made because of its content but 
because of specific compIaints about 
the page made to her office. 

In their statement, the si te 's cre-
ators called the warning an intimi-
dation tactic aimed at filtering 
undesirable subject matter. 

"This threat from the university 
has no merit," they stated. "From 
the beginning we expected campus 
administration to try and use such 
strong-arm tactics to censor us." 

In past months, the Web site 
has featured articles critical of 
UCSD students and Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox. 

Because she is confident that 
the site's creators will cooperate 
with a request to change the name, 
Parode said no official legal 
charges have yet been filed. 

After informal talks with the 
university, the site's creators 
included a disclaimer stating that 
the site has no affiliation with 
UCSD, but they stated that they 
plan to keep their name despite 

. Parode's request to change it. 
"The name of our outlet is not 

intended to mimic or confuse the 
name of this university but rather 
highlights 0\7 commitment to our 
auilience and peers amongst the 
student body," they stated. "We 
deliberately refrained from using 
'UCSD' or 'UC in our name 
because we were already aware of 
the school's prior attempts to 
defend their trademarks." 

Patent lawyer and copyright law 
expert Andy Greenberg said that 
because legal precedent exists for 
the arguments made by both sides, 
detennining which party is legally 
correct depends on the specific 
content of the Web site. 

However, he said the name of the 
site would Iilcely not cause confusion 
with that of the university, especially 
with the presence of a disclaimer. 

"It's really vet}' hard to ar~e 
that there is coruusion with the 
affiliation," Greenberg said. . 

A3 for the use of the image of 
Geisel Library, case law involving 
pictures of Hearst Castle has estab-
lished that "there is no copyright in 
the shape of a building," ac:cording 
to Greenberg. 

While the university may make 
severallegaI arguments, its warning 
over the use of the picture seems to 
be "an unusual extension of intel-
lectual property law," he said. 

If tile students do not comply 
with warnings to ·cease an(l 
desist," they may face misde-
meanor criniinal charges and be 
subject to university ilisciplinary 
processes, according to Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar. 

"It is easy for a large insti rution

Ex-sNL _iter gets tra:at-IICSI) 
Political pundit AI Franken urges 
students to stay poli.tically active 

ayRlANUIGA 
Senior StIff Writer 

AI Franken knows how to pick a fight. Fresh off of a respectable stint on "Saturday Night 
Live," he published 1999's "Rush 
Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot," using 
the tone of his nemesis to lash out 
at all things conservative and/or 
factually inaccurate. 

This year finds Frankef\ tread-
ing on Limbaugh's home rurf with 
the Air America radio screed "The 
AI Franken Show," which kicked 
off a national tour at Mandeville 
Auditorium on Sept. 30. In 
between prepping Meg Ryan for a 
pan in his radio play about Deputy 
Secretary of Defense Paul 
Wolfowitt as a werewolf (in which 
Wolfowitt eats the face of Vice 
President Dick Cheney) and 
culling through news articles for 
"terrible lies," Franken had a few 
words for the Gurtlilm. 

GrumlitJ,,: Most UCSD stu-
dents know of your fame from the 
reruns of "Saturday Night Live" as 
the empowering Stuart Smalley. So 
how'd you make the decision to 
become a hard-core pundit, com: 
ing from the mainstream of 
"Saturday Night Live"? 

Franken: On "SNL" we did a 
lot of political satire. I did 15 sea-
sons on the show, .and I'm very 
proud of the body of work that we 
did. [Former SNL writer) Jim 
[Miller) particularly was quite con-
servative, and we didn't feel it was 
fair to the other people on the show 
to be writing our own political 
views. So, the ethic of that show 
w-. tg, \DI~ ~ of everybody, and 
to do so equally. 

When I left the show finally in 
'95, I had I full contract to write 
about politics and to write what I 
wanted to write, (and) my name 
would be on the book! So that's 
when I started seriously getting 
into political punditry, although it's 
always been sabre. 

G: In terms of political satire, it 
seems like the lcind of mockery that 
yOu've been promoting on your 
show ... 

F: Scorn and ridicule! 

G: Well, with you and Jon 
Stewan and Michael Moore, it 
seems like this scorn and ridicUle is 
what's getting through to voters. 
Why? 

F: Well, I think what i lot of the 
campaigns do these days - I think 
it's both sides, but more the 
Republican side - is that they treat 
people like idiots. I think it's like 
the lowest common denominator 
lcind of campaigning. And I think 
that Jon does a great job, and that 
Michael and I try to give people a 
little bit of credit. 

G: For your last book, "Lies and 
the Lying Liars Who Tell Them," 
you had a crack research team of 
college students from the Harvard 
political school. What are your 
impressions of college students as 
political activists? 

F: We had some extremely 
impressive people in our group. A 
lot of them are in (POlitical) cam-
paigns right nOW,40 I'm very lucky. 
It's very inspiring to work with 
these men and women. 

G: For a lot of college students, 
political activism seems to drop off 
when they get a "legitimate" job. 
Any advice to keep us in the fray? 

F: Well, there's a couple ways to 
,do it. One is to get a legitimate job 
in .activism, and those exist! I mean, 
one of the things the right wing has 
done is create a career path for the 
Right. You know, good, paying, 
emting jobs like rwming the recon-
struction effort in Iraq, without 
mowing anything about (recon-

Traveling without moving 
Pop culture now truly a global experience 

full 
stop. 

Sarah Mak 

Honestly, what was I thinking when I decided to leave Hong Kong and move to San Diego? 
You can't puJJ a city girl out of her 
city and put her in San Diego l Did 
I really know what I was getting 
myself into? Was I - a British-
Chinese girl from Hong Kong -
really going to experience this 
thing they described at interna-
tional orientation as "culrure 
shock"? 

I always thought that my sirua-
tion had somewhat jaded me to the 
idea of culture shock; I was brought 
up under post-colonial Hong 
Kong's British education system, 
which was, after all, a hodgepodge 
of different nationali-
ties. Entertainment-
wise, the ex-colony 

and "settle in." Conversations 
would strike up and, of course, I 
would have to explain my situation: 
a British-Chinese girl from Hong 
Kong, going to school in San 
Diego and living in London for the 
summer, an explanation which 
drew looks of confusion. To add to 
this confusion, one traveler could-
n't understand why my mp3 list 
was the way it was: "Wait, I don't 
get why you have Elliott Smith, 

. Suede and the Cure. How on earth 
did you get into this Stuff? 
Shouldn't you be listening to 
Canto-pop or something?" Canto-
pop ... please, I had never bought 
or listened to a Canto-pop album 
in my life. I'm sure, somewhere out 
there, therc's a middle-aged . white 
guy in Nebraslw who Irnows more 
about Canto-pop than me. 

Ignoring that somewhat ignorant 
question, it was then that it hit me-
music, movies and popular culture 
have no borders, and thats their 
beauty. Thats why I love them so 
much. No matter where you are in 

" 

the world, be it 

was very much the 
same as when the 
British were there: I 
watched the same 
American sitcoms and 
movies, Australian 
soap operas, British 
comedies and the 
BBe. And my taste in 
music was influenced 
by my parents' record 

By the end of the 
summer I had 
witnessed four 
Spanish guys 

San Diego, 
London or Hong 
Kong, you will 
always find some 
way of fitting in 
through popular 
culture. 

As much as 
I'm prepared to 
bitch and moan 
about pop cul-
ture, I do have a 
soft spot for it-
after all, it makes 
up the best of my 
summer memo-
ries. My first 

collection from 
1970's England, 

singing to 
Madonna's lUke a 
Prayer' and Britney 

England's Top of the 
Pops, Rolling Stone, 
NME, the Britpop

scene in the '90s, Hong Kong's 
fleeting punk-rock scene (made up 
mostly of expatriate kids) and 
whatever our local pub jukebox had 
in it. But I just assumed that waS all 
there for the international commu-
nity, and I didn't thinle anything 
special of it. 

Nevertheless, how much of a 
culture shock could I really experi-
ence? I was ready for this thing 
they called studying abroad. I was a 
cocky freshman ... what can I say? 
It wasn't so much of a shock as it 
was a slap across the face ... multi-
ple times. Things were different, 
very different. And so I turned to 
the one thing my new "yank" 
friends and I could relate to: enter-
tainment in the form of trashy Tv, 
mindless entertainment gossip, 
movies and music. 

Not content with staying put in 
one place for long, I decided to 
spend the past summer working 
and living in London. London's 
heavy tourist population gives you 
the opportunity to meet people 
from allover the world and once 
again I'd have to make new friends 

experience with 
this multi-cultural, border-crossing 
experience of pop culture involved 
movies with Thomas, a French guy 
who was in London taking English 
classes. Me, attempting to speak in 
my broken, nonexistent French and 
him talking in his broken, some-
what-existent English about 
Quentin Tarantino. 

By the end of the summer I had 
witnessed four Spanish guys singing 
to Madonna's "Like a Prayer" and 
Britney Spears' "Toxic" on 
Thursday karaoke nights. I had 
taught a Japanese girl how to pro-
nounce "Avril Lavigne" (harder than 
you thinle), seen a Turkish couple 
take their 5 -year-old child to a 
Simon and Garfunleel cencert in 
Hyde Park and seen two buskers 
singing a Bob Marley song to a 
group of Japanese schoolgirls on the 
streets of Sapporo, Japan. Pop cul-
ture, more specifically American pop 
culture, was everywhere I went. 

So perhaps my siruation wasn't 
all that unique. All the evils of pop 
culture can be alleviated, to some

album reviews 

Who among us self-admitted nerds can forget such seminal 
videogame music as the 
du,!geon theme from 
"Legend Of Zelda" or Dr. 
Wiley's fortress music from 
"Mega Man 2?" 

The old videogame 
music was always subtle 
enough to fade into the 
background, yet interesting 
enough to listen to for 
hours. This brings us to 
Ratatat, the purveyors of a 

In his debut album, The Hunger for Mart, Lloyd Banks emerges from the 
ranks of G-Unit to match 
the success of spotlight-hog-
ging guru 50 Cent. 

In the hip-hop of today, 
mainstream MCs seem to 
fall into a limited number of 
categories. In G-Unit's case, 
Banks and company seem to 
be trying desperately to cap-
ture the "gangsta" mentality 
that largely died with the fall 
of Death Row Records. 

I have this coat I wear, it keeps me warm," confess-es Julie Doiron in "The 
Songwriter" - explaining 
her own music perfectly, 
perhaps. Goodnight Nobody, 
the Canadian singer/song-
writer's latest release, is 
exactly the kind of record 
one curls up to after being 
out in the cold for too long 
- emotionally or otherwise. 

Like her most discernible 
influence, the erudite 

**** 
fine collection of instru-
mental songs, featuring 
beautifully intertwined gui-
tar harmonies, dynamic 
e1ectro-bea ts and surging 
synths reminiscent of the 8-
and 16-bit days. 

The New York duo is 
composed of Evan Mast, a 
multi-instrumentalist beat-
writer (not the Kerouac 
kind), and guitarist Mike 
Stroud, who does session 
and tour work with Ben 
Kweller and Dashboard

Interscope Records' 

Over beats orchestrated 
by such producers as 
Timbaland, Hi-Tek (from -
Reflection Eternal with 
Talib Kweli) and Eminem, 
Banles drops ·. quick-witted 
lyrics that lack any serious 
depth. 

With a thickly hypnotic 
voice that echoes his men-
tor's mellow style, Banks 
brings nothing new to the 
game with a repertoire 

restric~ed to the repetitive 
themes of gang-banging, 

***~ 
Leonard Cohen, Doiron's 
songs are simply poetry 
placed to music. Her somber 
verse varies between being 
tiresome and hauntingly 
effective on paper, but even 
the most bromidic refrain is 
brought to vivid relief by the 
singer's flushed and breathy 
voice. 

Thanlcfully, Doiron's del-
icate tone and simple poesy 
are supported by a capable 
band; most of the songs on 

Confessional. 
Like the old videogame 

music, Ratatat engage the 
listener with complexities, 
but use repetition to make 
everything subtle and low-
key. 

From the animated 
town-music of "EI Pico" to 
the dance-march of 
"Germany to Germany," 
Ratatat build and release 
tension, lay down some 
rocking guitar and remain 
simultaneously interesting 
and atmospheric. 

Recommended for fans

from "Street Fighter II,"

money and unflinching mas-
culinity. 

Yet Banks, at the tender 
age of 22, is gaining much 
fame and notoriety with his 
debut, which not only fea-
tures such club hits as his 
first single "On Fire" and 
"Warrior," but also appar-
ently enough potential for 
him to make a name for him-
self outside of G-Unit. 

In his head-banging track, 
"I'm So Fly," Banks murmurs, 
"Don't confuse me with these 
sucbs / 'Cause when I spit 
you hear more oohs than a 
skip to my Lou move at the 
ruCd." Modesty is IIOt his 
strong point. 

Lloyd Banks will play at

Goodnight Nobody feature full 
guitar-bass-drum arrange~ . 
ments, sometimes with 
extended, though sparse, 
instrumental solos that keep 
them well out of the "just 
guitar and vocals" rut. 

But the essence of 
Goodnigbi Nobody is in 
Doiron's voice and words, in 
her ability to plunge into the 
solemn indictments of emo-
tional maturity, then stand 
up to regard the world with a 
fresh, gleaming innocence. 
It's an intensely personal, 
intimate vision - but what 
other lcind would be so com-
forting?

TIiURSDAY. OCTOIIER 7. 2004 

Franken: Political radio talk host 
shoots the breeze with Meg Ryan 

continued from pap II 
strllctionJ. These kids are 
Republican operatives in their 20s 
who really ha~ no experience, and 
whose only thing in corrunon was 
having filed their rC!umes OIl the 
Heritage Foundation's Web site. 
They had a 21-year-old who was in 
charge of domestic spending for 
security in Iraq. When asked what 
his last favorite job was, he said dri-
ving an ice cream truck! 

(;: So what do you say to those 
who drop the ball and don't get 
involved while the conservatives 
already have their career path run-
ning' 

F: It's your country. It's going to 
be your kids' country. You have to 

take some responsibility. There's a 
job you have as a citizen. and that 
means being informed. 

G: What would you say to a 
voter who was planning on voting 
for Bush. who thinks he'!; a nice 
guy, that kind of thing? 

F: Well, I have a different mea-
sure of the man. I'm Jewish, bm 
from what I understand abom 
Jesus' message, a good part of it 
was . about how you should be 
judged by how you treat the least 
among us. 

The "0 'Frlmlun FIlCtOt' FIlCtOt', a 
collection of radio segments from 
"'The AI Frank.en Show," was 
released on Sept. 21.

continued from page 12 
extent. At the risk of sounding sick-
eningly cheesy, pop culture does 
bring people together: A 
Radiohead fan in Marrakesh is the 
same as a Radiohead fan in 
Mumbai. Pop culrure, I believe, can 
be seen as a worldwide phenome-
non, and too often I don't think 
those in the pop industry realize 
the effect they have. The people at 
Fox probably don't even realize 
that through "The O.c." they have 
single-handedly spread the myth of 
the "wonder" that is Orange 
County and probably boosted its 
tourism. Hollywood and its movies 
have dazzled people beyond belief, 
and they truly believe that Los 
Angeles is the epitome of all things 
glamorous. Boy, will they be in for 
a shock. 

Whether it's the new punk 
movement in Beijing, the Irish pub 
in)apan or reggae in France, popu-

lar culrure is everywhere, and peo-
ple learn to assimilate through it. 
So this is to all the new in terna-
tional students out there: Moving 
to a new country is always hard, 
yes; it's all very well to live in San. 
Diego with its postcard-perfect 
beaches and weather, but at the end 
of the day you'll probably feel a lit-
tle homesick. Put on your favorite 
band's album, and I'm sure some-
one out there will strike up a con-
versation with you about it. Call it 
globalization, I call it feeling at 
home. • 

See, pop culture is just that -
it's popular, and it's· a common 
ground for us travelers to come 
together, mingle and feel less like 
outsiders. For now, though, I'll do 
anything for a "cuppa" with some 
chocolate "biccies" and a copy of 
Heat magazine from the United 
Kingdom to catch up on some 
trashy English gossip.

Tennis: Hawaii sweeps men's, women's singles 
COIUinutd from ". 20 

sets, 6-1, 6-2, in the consolation 
finals. 

All three UCSO doubles pain 
advanced to the second round. 
However, Hilker and Roberts lost 
to the eventual doubles champions, 
Liu and Hegedus, by a score of 8· 
2. Oao and McKee defeated Nicole 
Warm and Katie Murphy of 
Sonoma State, 8-4, before losing to 
Oehlia Feliz and Katrina 
Holmberg of Cal Poly Pomona, 8-
4, in the quarterfinals. 

The last Triton doubles pair to 
advance further in the draw was 
Siddiqui and Bronowicki, but Feliz 
and Holmberg defeated this pair as 
well in the semifinals, 8-4. 

Liu and Hegedus, who already 
t<?Ok first and second in singles, 
respectively, also took home a first-
place finish in doubles over Feliz 
and Holmberg with a convincing 
8-1 win.

were taking more shots." 
On Oct. 3, the Tritons started 

the back half of the tournament 
with a narrow match against No.7 
Loyola Marymount. In recent 
years, the Western Water Polo 
Association Championship has 
been a hotly contested rivalry 
between UCSD and the Lions; 
however, in light of taking heavy 
losses from last setSOO's graduating 
seniors, Loyola Marymount is not 
expected to return to the champi-
onship bracket at this year's tourna-
ment. Somebody apparently 
neglected to infonn the Lions team 
of this. 

Loyola Marymount stnJck first, 
shutting out the Thtons 1-0 in the 
first period. The Tritons responded, 
playing in1m!e defmse and mount-
ing an unstoppeble scoring drive to 
win the secood quarter S-O. 

"We were calling the second 
quartu apinst LMU the best quae-

[ tel' of Wita' polo that we've ever 
played," Woodrinr said. "We were 
making crisp passes, clean shots, our 
counteratadt was working and our 
defense was stopping everything that 
[Loyola Marymountl could bring." 

The Lions would win every 
other period in the matrh, with a 
close 3 -2 third frame and a 3-1 score 
in the fourth, but they still came up 
short as the Tritons took the match, 
8-7. 

Eichholz led the charge for the 
UCSO with an impressive four 

goals. He was complemented by 
Budnick, Jerkovic, Casellini and 
freshman driver Curtis Williamson, 
each with one. Junior goalie Colin 
McFlroy neked up 13 saves in the 

~ for the Tritons, securing the 
win. 

UCSD's final game of the tour-
nament mirrored that of the 
Loyola Marymount game, but was 
serded out of UCSD's favor. The 
Gauchos nllied early in the first 
quarter for an early 3-2 lead. This 
margin turned out to be the decid-

. " 
We were calling the second 
quarter against LMU the 
best quarter of tmter polo 
that we'tIe ever played."

ing factor in the match, as the 
Tritoni went toe-to-toc with UC 
Santa Barbara for the next t1u,~ 
quarters, without either team gain-
ing significant advantage. After 
each team scored twice in the sec-
ond quarter, the Gauchos went into 
the half with a S-4 lead. UCSO 
wouldn't be able to stage the come-
back it needed for the fifth-place 
tournament finish as the Gauchos 
took the match. 8-7. 

Scoring for the Tritons were 
Cooper, Eichholz, Finegold, 
Williamson and freshman driver 
Nathan Weiner. 

"Apparently, Denny has only 
won [at UC Santa Barban) twice," 
Wooodring said. "And they are a 
team that has been playing really 
~tronJ this season. They beat 
Loyola Marymount and UC Irvine 
at the NorCaI Tournament - both 
of those teams were nnked higher 
than UC Santa Barbara last week, 
so with all of their wins, they 
should have moved up considerably 
in the national rankings. [The Oct. 
7 match at UC Santa Barbara) will 
be big for us ... 

The Tritons were downed by 
the Gauchos at the Triton 
Invitational on Sept. 5 in a S-4 
showdown, demonstrating that 
UC Santa Barbara had an early-
season advantage. On Sept. 19 at 
the University of Southern 
California Tournament, UCSD 
tumed the tables with a 7-6 victo-
ry to level the playing field. With 
the loss at the NorCal 
Tournament, it's easy to question 
the ability of the Tritons, but it 
would be better to wait for the 
final scheduled meeting between 
the teams on Oct. 8. 

UCSO returns to Canyonview 
Pool for a six-game home stand 
between Oct. 15 and Nov. S, includ-
ing games against Stanford, Loyola 
Marymount, No. S UC Irvine and 
No.9 Pepperdine.

Cross country participates 
at Wmamette Invitational 
Women's team places third out of 31 

teams, men's team takes 11 th out of 28 
By MATTHEW GIANT 

Sports Editor 
UCSD junior Mimi Hodgins 

flew across the finish line in sixth 
place at the Wtllamette Invitational 
in Salem, Ore., on Oct. 2, just 39 
seconds behind the 5K race's leader, 
elevating the Triton women's cross 
country team to a third-place finish 
in a 3 I-team field. The men's team, 
led by senior Robert Eap, took 11 th 
place out of 28 entered teams in the 
8K race. Chico State dominated 
both the men's and women's field, 
with first-place finishes in both. 

The top-five Triton finishers on 
the women's side, whose perfor-
mances are included in. the team's 
scoring, crossed the finish Jjne 
among the first 27 competitors in 
the field of 271, earning the team 
92 points, just 10 points off of the 
second-place Edinboro College 
team score of 82. 

Hodgins' time of 17 minutes, 54 
seconds was the second-fastest ever 
recorded by a member of the UCSD 
women's squad at the Willamette 
Invitational, and was the all-tilne 
fifth-fastest race for any Triton at the 
race on ei ther the men's or women's 
side. 

Freshman Diane Dunn took sec-
ond among the UCSD women, 
completing the course in a time of 
18:06, good enough for 14th place. 
Freshman Katie Olson ran in third 
position for the Thtons, placing 21st 
overall with a time of 18:20, fol-
lowed by freshman Emily 
McGregor in 24th place, who fin-
ished in 18:27. Rounding out the 

scoring for the Triton women was 
junior Erin O'Donnell, who finished 
27th with a time of 18:29. 

On the men's side, Eap finished 
top among the Triton men, crossing 
the line at 24:45 for a 15th place fin-
ish in the 261-competitor field. 

Sophomore Dan Holligan was 
the second-fastest UCSD runner, 
finishing the race in 26:09, merining 
65th place, followed by freshman 
Kevin Klein at 26:20 for 73rd place. 
Rounding out Triton scoring were 
sophomore Jad Mulgrew, crossing 
the line at 26:44, and freshman Ryan 
Becijos at 26:59, earning 92nd and 
l04th places, respectively. 

Chico State won the event in the 
men's division, as seven Wt.ldcat run-
ners completed the eight kilometer 
course in. the' top-fourteen places. 

The Tritons rerum to La JoUa on 
Oct. 9 for the UCSD Triton Classic,

Associate Sports Editor 

Think it's difficult to beat out 
the top doubles teams in your 
region? Try squeezing in a Law 
School Admissions Test in between 
matches, which is what senior 
Bryan Swatt endured en route to 
his doubles win with junior Brent 
Molden in the 
WilsonlIntercollegiate Tennis 
Association West Regional Men's 
Tennis Championships on Oct. 3. 

The duo defeated Thomas 
Morton arid Andy Muesse of 
Sonoma State, 8-3, at Northview 
Tennis Courts. The win advances 
Molden and Swatt to the' finals of 
the Intercollegiate Tennis 

- Association National Small College 
Championships in Fort Myers, 
Fla., held Oct. 14 to Oct. 17. 

The Small College 
Championships include the eight 
regional champions from NCAA 
Division II, III, the National 
Association of IntercoHegiate 
Athletics and community colleges. 

Last year, graduated seniors 
Sameer Chopra and Jeff Wilson 
also advanced to the doubles finals, 
taking second overall. UCSD men's 
tennis head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
knows Swatt and Molden must 
work hard to win the champi-
onships. 

"In Florida, Bryan and Brent 
have a good chance to do well if they 
do two things," Steidlmayer said. 
"The first is to serve well. That will 
be critical. Secondly, they will need 
to be a bit more consistent with their 

returns. H they do those two things, 
they may be able to improve upon 
Sameer and Jeff's final result from 
last season. " 

Six Tritons comprised the 16 
total players in the singles bracket 
while three pairs competed in dou-
bles. Molden and freshman John 
Caldwell were ' seeded third and 
fourth in singles, respectively, and 
Swatt and Molden were seeded sec-
ond. 

Sophomore Seth Spector and 
freshmen Eric Rubens, Blake 
Meister and Alex Whitmore also 
joined Molden and Caldwell in the 
singles bracket. 

Rubens and Molden advanced 
to the semifinals and lost to BYU-
Hawaii's Dillon Porter, 6-4, 6-2, 
and Dorian Porada, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 
respectively. In the finals, Porada 
won over teammate Porter in three 
sets, 7-6, 3-6,6-1. 

This tournament gave 
Steidlmayer the chance to see his 
freshmen in competition. 

"I like what I see," Steidlmayer 
said. "Eric Rubens stepped up to 
make it to the semifinals in singles 
and Blake Meister went far in the 
consolation draw after losing a 
tough first-round match. That is 
definitely a good sign." 

Spector and Meister both 
advanced to the semi6nals of the 
consolation draw but play was halt-
ed due to time constraints. 

Steidlmayer was pleased to 
have home-court advantage and 
was grateful for the help from the 
UCSD athletic department. 

al definitely think it was nice to 

play here," Steidlmayer said. "Our 
administration in the athletic 
department - Wendy May, Laurie 
Turner~d Dave Wahlstrom - aU 
do a tremendous job and all really 
helped to make it a great tourna-
ment." 

On the women's side, UCSD 
senior Jasmin Dao, juniors Marissa 
Hilker and Leigh Roberts, sopho-
mores Katie McKee, Ali Legakis 
and Marsha Malinow entered the 
singles draw. 

The three Thton doubles pairs 
were made up of Dao and McKee, 
Roberts and Hilker, and second-
seed junior Tara Siddiqui and 
sophomore Kristin Bronowicki. 

Hilker and Malinow both 
advanced to the quarterp.nals with 
Malinow falling to second-seed 
Jing Jing Liu of BYU-Hawaii in 
straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. 

Hilker also lost her semifinal 
matchup, 6-0, 6-1, to first-seed 
Adrienne Hegedus, of BYU-
Hawaii. The finals, much like the 
men's, pitted two BYU-Hawaii 
players against each other. Liu took 
the women's tide over teammate 
Hegedus, 7-6, 6-3. 

Although McKee and 
Bronowicki were knocked off in the 
singles draw, they bounced back 
and advanced far in the consolation 
draw. 

McKee advanced to the quarter-
6na1s ~d lost to Renee Paquillo of 
Cal Poly Pomona, 6-3, 6-4. UCSD 
got its revenge over Paquillo when 
Roberts defeated her in straight

Tritons place sixth at NorCal Tourney 
Stanford breaks UCSD's eight-game win streak 
By MATTHEW GIIAifr 

Sports Editor 
Head coach Denny Harper and 

his Triton men's water polo squad 
have discovered a fonnidable 
adversary and a potentia. rival in 
No. 10 UC Santa Barbara this sea-
son. Following the University of 
Pacific-hosted NorCal 
Tournament at Chris Kjeldsen 
Pool in Stockton, Calif., on Oct. 2 
and Oct. 3, No.6 UCSD played 
the Gauchos through three one-
point matches and earned a 1-2 
record against them, while still 
maintaining a higher ranking in 
the' Men's National Collegiate 
Top-20 Poll. 

The Tritons entered their final 
nonconference tournament of the 
2004 season with a 14-4 record as 
the team squared off against No. 7 
St. Francis on the morning of Oct. 
2. Though these teams have not 
yet met this season, UCSD dis-
missed the Terriers from New 
York handily, dishing out a 10-6 
victory and extending the Tritons' 
season-high winning streak to 
eight games. 

Freshman two-meter man 
Simon Schafer led the charge for 
UCSD, rounding up a hat trick, 
while junior two-mete.r man 
Matthew Budnick and freshman 
driver Adnan Jerkovic notched 
two apiece to help lead their team. 
Senior driver Nate Cooper, junior 
driver Chris Eichholz and junior 
two-meter man Chris Finegold 
completed the Triton scoring 
drive to secure the victory. 

The road stopped there for 
l,1CSD, however, who faced the 
No. I Stanford Cardinal in the 
second game of the day. Despite 

. 

an eight-ioal effort by the 
Tritons' offense and junior goalie 
Bryan Corbett's six saves, the 
Cardinal ran away with the game, 
14-8. 

The Tritons distributed their 
momentum across the tank, 
enabling 'sophomore utilities Joe 
Woodring and Jesse Casellini and 
Jerkovic to score twice apiece. 
Eichliolz and Schafer were held to 

one goal each in the contest. 
"Stanford went up on us early, II 

Woodring said. "They had a 6-0 
lead [after the first quarter], so 
Denny was trying some different 
combin:ltions with the bench. He 
took out Eichholz and Fmegold, 
which is where we usually direct 
the ball, so the rest of the guys
