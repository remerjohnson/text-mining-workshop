Letter to the Editor 

AS treated new activity 
fee proposal unfairly 
Editor: 

At the AS Council meeting 
held t he tent h week of last 
quarter. thc council was pres· 
ented \\.'ith a proposed referen· 
dum dealing with the 
mandatory student activity 
fee (cu rrently, 8). If put on the 
ballot this spring. the measure 
woulrl allow students to vote 
on two questions: (I) whether 
the fee s hould be mandatory or 
\'oluntary, and (2) if voluntary. 
who should decide where it is 
spent - theA council.orthe 
individual students. 

TOW we all know how the 
council likes to give away 
monev (if anyone is una\\, areof 
thi , ( sugg 5t going to a meet-
ing), and it was a pretty sure 
bet that many counci l 
members weren't going to like 
the idea. I don't think their 
reaction urprised anyone. 
Several members spoke out 
emphatically against the idea, 
and it was tabled, pending a 
review by the rules committee. 

Jim Cahill , the student who 
presented the proposal, had no 
chance to reply to any of the 
objections, due largely (I think) 
to the meeting formaL This is 
too bad , since any argument 
deserves a reply; feeble ones, 
especially, deserve a quick and 
painles death. 

As a s tudent with a social 
conscience, I feel it is my duty 
(to society) to address these 
arguments. In addition, other 
s tudents can see what kinds of 
arguments were (and wi ll be) 
used to support the retention 
of mandatory fees . 

One argument seemed to be 
that if the fee were made 
voluntary, the AS system 01 
representation would no 
longer be democratic. This all 
depends, of course, on what 
you mean by "democratic." 

What do AS counci l 
mem ber mean by democratic? 
Do they mean "of. by and for 
the student," performing for 
students the services s tudents 
want (and not performing 
those st udent don't want)? Or 
do they mean "for the stu· 
dents," regardles of what the 
students themselves think 
they want? 

[f it is the first. t here is no 
need for any debat on the mat-
ter in qu~t ion. ,tudents, I 
think, realize that things cost 
money; and if they want them 
- from t he AS coun il as from 
anywhere - they will pay for 
them. And if they don't want 
them, they won't pay . 

And what if nobody pays 
anything? This is possible; in 
fact. many council members 
seemed to take it for granted, 
whIch to me does not IOdicat e a 
lot of confidence in what t hev 
are doing with our money. [t 
..;eems to me that if nobody 
pays anyt htog, nobody wants 
anything; and conver"cly. if 
students clon't want anything. 
the council doesn't need any 
money with which to prm' ide 
it. 

tudents do expect things 
from the council, it could be 
argued - everyone wou Id just 
try to get a free nde, and no one 
would pay. Maybe. But ,tu-
dent would learn fast that, 
contrary to appearances. the 
AS council ca nnot create 
money. and that students 
them elves must provide it. 

It 's a bil extreme to think 
that if the activity fee were 
voluntary, not a s ingle student 
would pay it. Some would and 
some wouldn't. And s ure, 
th ere would be people who 
would benefit but did not pay. 

But this can ' t be eliminated 
by forcing a ll students to pay. 
Many never get or want any 
u se out of what their money is 
used for. The result is the 
same: some studen ts paying 
for what other use - only in 
one case it is voluntary, in the 
other they have no choice. 

All of thi s makes perfect 
sense, if you hold the view that 
the AS council exists to pro· 
vide services that students 
want. 

But from the impression I 
get, many counci l members 
believe quite the opposite. 
Their arguments against a 
volu ntary activity fee are 
based on the premise that 
what students want , they 
really don't want, they only 
think they do. 

Whether counci l members 
lack the guts to state and try to 
support their premise. or 
whether they aren ' t aware of 
what they are arguing, 1 don't 
know. (l will leave out of the 
discussion a third pos ibility: 
that they know full well what 
they are doing, and are using 
the arguments to get money 
for their own ends). 

Stud nts would not pay, the 
arguments went, and so the 
council would have no mon y 
to gTve to student organiza· 
tions and program, but s till, 
f>tudents want these things. 
Th, V simply aren't wi lling to 
say so with a willingness to 

pay for them. 
Thi~ unwillingnes~. pre-

sumably. does not mean that 
student's value their money 
morethan theyvalucwhal the 
council might do WIth it. but 
rather that students arc clue 
Ie"" a:-- to what they va lue . 

rr ~OIneonc came up to me 
and offen-'d to take a sum of my 
money to go buy me a ~p()rt ~ 
car, it's conceivable (as~um ing 
[ had t he money) t hat I wou Id 
accept. But I also might say no. 
Maybe I just dont want a 
ports car right now. I wou ld 

think it rather absurd if this 
person then started telling me 
that in fact I really did want a 
sports car, but just didn't 
know it, and that 1 had to give 
him the money to buy it forme. 

The f s ituation is the 
same, reagardless of what 
some might argue. The AS 
council exists to provide servi· 
ces tudents want. And 
although it' s always nice to get 
something free in life, if we 
really want something, we 
have to be willing to pay for it. 
Bu t if we don't want 'ome-
thing, we s houldn ' t be 
expected to pay for it: nor do 
we need anyone tel ling us that 
we are mistaken if we think we 
don't want it. 

As a further justification for 
the mandatory fee , I heard 
what is perhaps the lamest 
excuse of them all : s ince eve-
ryone else does it - the 
government collects taxes; it's 
simply a fact of life, the way 
our society works. 

This is true. But at one time, 
slavery was the way a large 
part of our society worked. 
Would council member have 
argued that this made it o. k. 
for anyone to go out and en-
s lave someone? 

Untortunately, the govern-
ment does take money from 
people - and then it proceeds 
to decide for them what they 
want done with it: thing like 
buying cheese to give people, 
buying grain to give to the 
Soviet Union, or buying wea· 
pons to g ive to EI Salvador. 

Now I realize that the AS 
council has no plans to end 
guns to EI Salvador - 1 hope 
not anyway. But any personal 
judgements on where the 
money goes tend to obscure the 
point: it is not fort he council to 
tell studen ts what they want 
or ought to want. And unl '5S 
council members think that 
t his is t heir job, their n('('d for

Stables 
approved 

UC Regents two weeks ago 
approved the ickles/O'13rien 
proposal for the development 
of the La Jolla Farms Stables 
property, leaving few people 
surpri ed . 

The Sickles/ O'Brien devel -
opers, who have been the cen-
ter of controversy ever s ince 
they propo ed to build on the 
land las t November, now have 
the go ahead to con tru ct 36 
town homes, a confe rence cen-
ter. a research complex, and a 
shopping center on the 24 
acres of university property . 

However. a further aspect to 
the development proposal has 
been added: Chancellor Atkin-
son recommended to the 
regents that the developers 
establis h a forum of di scuss ion

make a flllal recommendatIOn 
to the nte Finance Educa-

deliberating on the UC 1982-83 
budget. 

UC Vice President William 
Fretter told the subcommittee 
la s t week the University 
received 15 percent more appli-
cations than expected, Since 
the Univers ity must accept all 
qualified applicants - those in 
the top 12 percent of their high 

proposed development wi ll 
"disrupt the quality of life" 
and also conflict with present 
planning codes. 

UCSD doc 
a candidate 

Dr. Daniel Kripke, an A so-
ciate Profe or of Psychiatry at 
the Medi ca l School, an -
nounced recently that he plans 
to run for the State Senat eas a 
democrat. 

The district which Kripke is 
running in , the 38t h , includes 
UCSD. 

Kripke is basing his ca m-
paign on the idea that the Ca li -
fornia State Senate is "full of 
lawyers and bus ines men who 
can not seem to solve the 
sta te's many problems." 

The Senate "needs a doctor 
in the house," he stated at a 
press con ference earlier this 
month . 

''Two t lmds of our Califm· 
ilia budget goes for better edu-
cation and medical care." 
Kripke "aid. "I am a physlLian

DC changes admissions requirements 
A I1niversity of California 

faculty committee has acted to 
chang admissions require-
ments at UC effective for the 
fa ll of 1986. The chang s 
require final action by the UC 
Board of Regent'i. 

The primary changes are to 
require that student s take 
additional academic high 
. chool cours s and, in det er· 
mining a 5t ud nt 's admissibil· 
ity. to give extra weight to 
honors· level courses that 
t ud nts take in high choo!. 

tion and literature. 
(c) Three year of mathe· 

matics. one year each in ele· 
mentary algebra, geometry 
and intermediate algebra . 
. (d) A year· long cour in a 
laboratory science taken in lhe 
10th, 11th or 12th grade. 

(e) Two year·long courses in 
a single foreign language. 

that up to four units taken in 
lIth and 12th grades, if certi · 
fied by (he high school as 
offered at an honors· level, will 
be count don a sca le where an 
"A" receives five POInts, a "B' 
four and a ·'C· three In com· 
puting grade point average". 
These courses must be in hi ,,· 
tory. Engli sh, ad\' a nced 
mathemati cs. laboratory 
science or foreign languag . 

In making t he changes, the 
facult y committee pointed out 
(hat "all English cour es mU. t 

req uire frequent and regular 
pract ice in writing expository 
prose compoSitions of some 
length," and that most elective 
courses "should Inn)lve con· 
slderable readIng and "hould 
aim to de\' ' lop the ..,tudent ·"

and skill with \\ rIlten and oral 
exposi tion. "

from at least two of the follow· 
ing: hi s tor y. Engli s h . 
advanced mathematics, labor· 
atory sc ien ce. for eign 
language, social science or fine 
arts. 

-In calculating a student's 
grade point average, a grade of 
"A" in a course receives four 
points, a "B" three and a "C" 
two. Only grades for courses 
taken in 10th , lIth or 12th 
grade are u ed in the computa-
tion to determine admi sibi-

"Drilling is an expensive and
