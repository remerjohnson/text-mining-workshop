By GAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

The 2003 A.S. elections proces 
marked Its Start on March 10 after 
students filed for candIdacy by noon 
and ancnded a mandatory evening 
meeting ",Iuch finalized the roster of 
candidates running for each office. 

Of SIX pre idential candidates 
originally m the race, one, indepen-
dent candidate Cabe Grossman, 
was deemed ineligible by the elec-
tions committee for missing thc fil-
ing deadli ne, and while hi starus is 
undetermrned, he has not filed an 
appeal. Presidenual ca ndidates 
remaining include Bryan Barton, 
runmng as an independent; Jeremy 

allagher, running on the Unrty 
slate; Kevin Shawn IIsu, running 
on the Srudents First! slate; Kevin

and Brian Uiga, running on the 
officially termed "The ew 
Students FIrst of the Ul1Ity Action

With two candidates with first

name Kevin and last name IIsu , 
both parnes Involved expressed 
concern over possible voter confu-
sion. 

"I'm nOt ure what the II1tennon 
of the other KeVIn IIsu was 111 run-
ning, but ['m hoping that it's legiti-
mate and that it's going to be a clean 
campaign," said Kevll1 Shawn Hsu, 
who currently serve on the A. . 
Councd as vice president II1ternal. 

\Vhile the current vice president 
internal has been known to others 
during his term as simply Kevin 
H su, he said that he hoped that fil-
ing for the elections with his mid-
dle name, Shawn, would help dif-
ferentiate him from hIS opponent. 

'" t11ink people are goi ng to rec-
ogni ze a strong affiliation with 
Students First l, and hopefully that 
will be enough to distinguish the 
difference," he said. 

Adding to the possibility of con-
fusion, however, is the independent 
candidate Ilsu's affil iation with the

According to Elections 

Manager Robi n Shelton, the com-
mittee has noufied cach candidate 
that they may file a one-page expla-
nation if they wish to be reconsid-
ered for candidacy. helton could 
not specify the number of cases 
currently pending such revisions, 
but said that tardiness was "not the 
issue on all of them." 

Ilowever, Grossman, who cur-
rently serves on the A.S. Council as 
commissioner of programming, 
said that he would not file for an 
appeal, having had "no base" for his 
packet being late and that there was 
no precedent in dealing with a case 
like his that would exempt him 
from the elections bylaws. 
According to Grossman, he arrived 
at the A.S. Executive Assistant's 
office 25 minutes late because he 
was finishing gathering the 150 ml-
dent signarures required by candi-
dates before filing for the election. 

"It was a very la t-mlnute deci-
sion to run," said Grossman. who 
had been concentrating on coordi-
nating WinterFest and other 
events for the past few weeks. " 1y 
last-minute motivation came from 
seei ng that none of the candidates 
really were goi ng to focus on 
Improving srudent life." 

Grossman, a jUl1lor atJohn ,\IUlr 
College, was Involved Ifl .\1U1r orga-

niz.~tions and the A.S. programming 
committee for his first twO years 
hefore erving as . commi SlOner 
of programming. He aid that Ius 
campaign would have focused on 
improving rudenr life and allocat-
109 more funding ro A. . program-
mlflg. Accordlllg to Grossman. It 

would have been especially impor-
tant to work on weekly on-campus 
events in the event of a freshman 
parking ban next year. 

"I know I'm a qualified candI-
date," Grossman said. "I gues~ It 
was too late for thiS year and I'm 
sorry I won't he around for next 
year, but hopefully other candi-
dates will sec this and 11 will get 
them to pay more attention to 
these Important issues." 

Two Uniry slate candidates, 
Raul Perez and Todd Tolin, drc 
also, as of date, meliglble due to 
misslflg the noon deadllllc. 

"They were qualified candi-
dates, and I was more disappointed 
for them than for myself," 
Grossman said. 

Perez, a Thurgood Mar~hall 
College junior transfer runni ng for 
the office of vice president t1nance, 
said he would not file an appeal. 

According to Perez, he was 13 
mmute late because he had to col-
lect a portion of hiS 150 ~Ignatures 
from anOther srudcnt and travel 
across campus, blamll1g hl~ bte 
watch and the A.S. ofticlal's fast 
one for the tardmess. 

"I was devastated," Perez said. 
"I understand the laws. but perhaps 
they could be a little more consid-
era te at umes." 

Perez said that aftcr Jttcndlflg 
the candidates' mecung at 6 p.m. 
that evening and heanng the elec-
tions committee speak about how 
strictly they would be appl~1ng

Balanced war 
• presentation was 

appreciated 
\'\'ith the pro pect of a military conflict 

in Iraq looming, many members and orga-
OI z:J tio n of the UC b campu communi-
ty have taken the opportunity to present 
the requ isite forums and fanfare een on 
college campu es. Rallie , "teach-ins" and 
pand discussions have all contributed to a 
rising political climate on campu over the 
past year. 

On March ,a forum titled "\Var in 
Iraq· Contemplating th e Con eguences" 
\\ a~ held at Peter on Hall and In cl uded 
three DC erofessor and an offici al from 
the C. . l\av)'. Thi event proved to be 
very helpful In maintaining a dialogue 
about the Impending war in Iraq. 

CSD professor Michael Bernstein 
and Vali Tasr spoke on the economic 
repercussions of a war and the impact a 
war would have on the activism conducted 
by the Islamic society, respectively. Kiren 
Chaudry, a political SCIentist at C 
Berkeley, di cu ed the regional conse-
quences in the 1iddle East following an 
invasion of Iraq, and U. . Navy CajJtain 
Richard Ray spoke about the conflict from 
an American military viewpolllt. 

The event provided those in attendance 
with the opportunity to listen to speakers 
of varying perspectives and field of exper-
tise engage in a constructive dialogue 
about an issue that has been distorted too 
much by emotion and slog?neering on this 
campus. Students and staff had the oppor-
tunity to develop informed opinions on a 
subject that has become all too cluttered . 

Speakers at the March event delivered 
opinions that were substantiated by fact 
and thoup,htful insiRht. To call a university 
event a 'teach-in, the event should be 
designed to teach students about the facets 
of die issue from more than one viewpoint, 
while basing arguments on fact and edu-
cated speculation, and straying away from 
partisan agenda. 

The Guardian applauds the efforts put 
forth by the March 7 event's organizers to 
present a thoughtful and well-represented 
dialogue, regarding an issue where past 
presentations of a similar nature have 
often been about emotion and politics 
instead of information and balance. As a 
publication that strives to deliver obJectiv-
Ity and balance in its reporting, we believe 
that campus events of thi nature should 
be held to the same standard . 

Furthermore, the Guardian urge~ other 
campus groups that Intend to present 
"educational" or "informative" events 
about such Issues as the AmerIcan-Iraq or 
IsraelI-Palestinian conflicts to follow SUIt , 
and remember that the goal of any unIver-
sity community IS to eaucatc - and that 
intrinsically requires prOVIding more than 
one perspective.

Appointed commissioners are a bad idea 
Elections are best way to choose campus leaders 

By DANIEL WArn

The Grove Caffe and AS. Lecture 
• otes arc tudent-run entertrpi es, 
generating profitS that go directly to 
Ult dtudent governmem. These mini-
buslilesses are operated by the com-
miSSIOner of entrepnse operations, 
who is also reponsible for creating any 
new student-run operations. 

The A.S. Council came within seven 
votes of taking away our right to elect 
thJS commissioner, as wdl as to elect the 
student officers chuged with defending 
srudentS' fights, promoting diversity 
and representing the needs of under-
graduates to the Acaderruc Senate. The 
council narrowly f.ailed a constitutional 
amendment that, once passed by four of 
the SIK college councils, would have 
made these and all other commissioners 
appOinted rather than elected . 

Instead , they put it up to a vote of the 
srudent body - the same student body 
that half the counCil doesn't truSt to vore 
for Its comrrusslOners is no ..... being asked 
to vote on whether it should continue to 
ha\'e the nght to vote for itS comrrus-
slOners. Although It'S purely an adViSOry 
vote, the srudent body should send a 
mes age to the counCil by voting to keep 
the comrrussloner poslOons elected. 

A1lowlllg the AS. president and a 
handful o f commillee members to 
appoint commissioners gives IIlcredlbl e

reeell! ( lIltroverSlal appomUllent of the 

CAMPUS 
commissioner of Academic Affairs, 
about which there was little, if any, dIS-
cussion by the senate. 

A.S. President Jenn Brown rightly 
argued against the amendment, noting 
this possibility of cronyism. Indeed, 
Brown's appoincment of a faithful con-
stituent to the Academic Affairs post -
and the senate's subsequent rubber-
stamp - is the perfect example of the 
political cronyism she abhors. Having 
the outgoing commissIOner SIt in on the 
Interviews for the position, as is suggest-
ed by the amendment, wouldn't have 
done much good, slilce outgoing 
Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
I lalle Beiwllahl had been a omewhat 
lackluster commissioner herself. 
Imagine the pollOcal spoils system that 
would result from the president 
appomung not one, but tight Important 
posluons, each wah a subst:lnual week-
ly stipend and Price .enter office pa c. 

Supporters of the amendment con-
tend that apl>OlIHed po~llIom are acrual -

~lIlce It 'S ea ler to fire appOinted lacker~

However, the (OIlUIlI))lOnCI )hould Ix.:

senate. There are tenalll comml)\loner 
IXlSlOom where a candidate's qualifica-

tions on paper don't matter nearly as 
much as the candidate's ideology. 
Imagine a commis ioner of diverSity 
affairs who was in favor of Ward 
Connerly's initiatives, or a faculty-
friendly commissioner of academic 
affairs who thought all rotten cheaters 
ought to be strung up :Ind flogged . Both 
would stand a fair chance of coa ting 
through the senate confirmation vote, 
bur they wouldn't st:lnd a snowball!. 
chance in hell of wlllrting an election . 

The turmoil surrounding this year's 
commissioner of acadellllc affairs POSt IS 
a stunning example of both the need for 
the constirutional amendment and the 
best argument against it. The elected 
commissioner, Beitollahi, didn't do her 
job and failed to send srudent represen-
tatives to several important committees. 
Beitollahi resigned and was replaced by 
an appointed commissioner, Erne to 
Martinez. Martinez has thu far been an 
effective commissioner, doing a better 
job in the pan of a few weeks than 
Beitollahi did In the previou~ )IX 
months, which eems to justify the push 
to make all commissioners appointed. 

But effective as Martinez i , he was 
apP'limed without Ignificant debate 
or discussion by the senate. Any 
appoliltment to ~uch a prestigIOUS 
position reqUire at least some llIud -

THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 200) THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Appointed: 
Elections 

don't allow 
favoritism 

Phone calls can be a perplexing problem 

cOllunued from page4 
ment's supporters are trying to 
avoid. 

The idea of appointing cOlnmis-
sioners isn't a new one. Some A.S. 
council members had been thinking 
about turning commissioners into 
aplXlinred IXlsitions since last spring, 
when the Students First! political 
machine nearly swept the elections 
with a few candidates of questionable 
competence. Originally, tile push to 
change to appoinunents was based 
on the desire to break the proverbial 
back of the political machine by tak-
ing away most of its all-campus 
elected positions. This reasoning is 
flawed . Slates become even more 
influential when the power to 
appoint eight paid positions is given 
to 3 handful of officers, radler than 
to the electorate. A president could-
n't fill a slate with candidates from 
the narrow constituencies, but she 
could dangle the much more alluring 
promise of guaranteed positions for 
those same candidates. Its much eas-
ier to appoint people than it is to get 
them elected. 

We've managed to survive so far 
with elected commissioners; the 
occasional Beitollahi aside, they've 
been reasonably competent. Those 
pushing for the amendmcnt are, for 
thc most part, well-intentioned. 
But every appoinnllent confirma-
tion vote IS another example of the 
senate's unwillingness to override 
an executive 's appoliltment deCI-
sion, and the likelihood of a spoils 
system developlllg outweighs any 
benefits that may be derived from 
appointing commissioners. 

stop 
that! 
Bertrand Fan 

L ately, I've been getting these phone calls on my cell phone where it displays the number 
but doesn't register with any of the 
names in my phone hook. r find 
these calls to be the worst. They're 
even worse than "restricted caller," 
although "restricted caller" is usual-
ly an asshole, too. Restricted callers 
tend to live in LA and not San 
Diego - no one blocks their num-
ber in San Diego. I attribute this 
mainly to that huge campaign 
Pacific Bell had five years ago in 
L.A., telling people that they could 
block their phone numbers. I think 
it was probably due to some privacy 
lawsuit, but in the end it padded 
their pockets even more because a 
typical phone conversation with 
Pacific Bell is like this: "Thank YOll 
for calling Pacific Bell. To continue 
in English, press one. (Yadda yadda 
Espanol yadda yadda dos.) If you do 
not have a touch-tone phone, please 
stay on the line." 

Do they even make non-touch-
tone phones? I think the last time 
I had one was in 1985, and it was 
shaped like Pac-man and emitted 
pulses. It took like three minutes 
to dial a number. 

"Please enter your home tele-
phone number, followed by the 
pound key." 

You ' ll be put on hold for about 
20 minutes and then get : "For qual-
Ity assurance, your phone call Illay 
be recorded. Hi , thiS IS (60-year-old 
pissed-off lady's name), can I have 
your home telephone number'" 

I've often wondered why they 

make you type it in the first place. I 
also thought you needed both par-
ties' permission to record a tele-
phone call in the state of Califorrtia. 
Is this to imply that permission is 
just a matter of stating something, 
and then if the other person doesn't 
hang up then it is granted? Well, 
spank my ass and call me Charlie; I 
have a few phone calls to UCSD to 
make concerning permission to 
park in "A" spaces. 

Then, they'll ask you your name 
and the last four digitS of your social 
security number, and then you can 
talk about why you're calling and 
just when you think the conversa-
tion is over: "I see from our records 
that you have call waiting." 

"Yup, sure do." 
"Did you know that for the 

price of twO additional services, 
you can get five' It's called 'The 
Works' package." 

"Yeah, I know about that, I 
would like just to keep call waiting." 

"Or, for the price of three addi-
tional services, you can get 10. It's 
called 'The Super Works' package." 

u 0 shit." 
"You get caller 1.0., caller-I.D. 

waiting, call waiting, call forward-
ing, the message center, speed dial 
and special rings for your whole 
family." 

"I can ba ically say anything 
right now, and you wouldn 't stop 
talking, huh'" 

"In fact, this month, and this 
month only, if you order Pacific 
Bell DSL, you can Cllt your 
monthly phone rates in half!" 

"I primarily use my phone for 
gay midget porn seK lines and 
threatening the president's life." 

"Then this package is totally 
for you!" 

"I don't want It. " 
"But if you order it now, we'll 

give you $20, and you can cancel at 

the end of the month! That's like 
getting a $20 check for nothing!" 

"I'd have to talk to you again." 
I used to work retail, and I had 

to push extended warranties, and 
I'm very sympathetic toward com-
mission-based sales. This being 
said, I think all PacBell (sorry, 
SBC: different name, same crappy 
service) representatives can go 
suck a fuck. Maybe instead of 
advertising the fact that they've 
changed the name of the company, 
or that caller-I.D. blocking is 
available, they could take that 
money and hire people that have 
graduated from high school. 

But getting back to these phone 
calls I've been getong, they start out 
with, "Hi, may I speak with 
Bertrand Fan?" It reminds me of 
what you would say if you were call-
ing someones parents' house want-
ing to ask their daughter out in lugh 
school. Anythi ng that st:lrts wi th 
that nowadays sucks - it's either a 
collection agency, the police or a 
survey. Theoretically, I shouldn't be 
getting phone calls like that because 
I go out of my way to implement a 
campaign of misinformation. 

Whenever anybody asks for my 
cell phone number who isn 't a 
friend, I reverse the last twO digits 
of my phone number. It sounds 
more real when you do that. I was at 
Barona the other day, igrting up for 
a Players Plus card, and they real-
ized I already had an account. They 
asked me if my number was still the 
number I had fre hman year, and I 
realized that I had inverted the 
numbers back then, too. I con-
fif1l1.ed that it was the same number, 
since I didn't reaUy see a point in 
updatlllg it to another fake number. 

But these recent calls are appar-
emly from UCSD, some SOrt of 
graduating survey. I'm not actuaUy 
tOO sure because r SOrt of feel like a 

dick hanging up on them, so I just 
tell them to call back later, saying 
that I'm tOO busy right now. 0 far 
they've called at these extremely 
busy times : playing Monopoly, 
looking at w7JlWfotchiclmnporty-
holS.com and during a commercial 
break during "The Simpsons,'· 

I don't really think it applies to 
me anyway; they ask quescions like, 
"Are you graduating this year?" 
and really, only my professors can 
answer that. I'm really at a loss on 
how to deal with them. Two obvi-
ous options are aculally taking the 
damn surveyor waiting out the rest 
of the school year, but I'm really 
looking for an easier out. 

I usually respond to telemar-
keter calls with, "SorryI'm not-
in teres ted pleaseremoveme from -
yourlist." Sometimes I say, "click." 
But these guys eem really fnend-
Iy; definitely not your run-of-the-
mill telemarketers. They always 
ask if it's an inconvenient time for 
me. In other words, they'd be real-
ly bad in a boder room. When the 
hell is it ever a convenient time for 
people to talk to telemarketers? 
Well, last night might have been 
amusing, it would have been a IlIce 
mterlude between my seventh or 
eighth shot o f Jagermelster. AI 
that point, I really would have 
talked to anybody that called me. 

You ever wake up the next day 
wi th a hangover and go through 
your recent calls liM' It never fails to 
fascinate me; people r haven't talked 
to in months are usually at the top. 
Some of those people are even on 
my blacklist ringtone - the one 
that rings, telling me not to pick up 
the phone unless I want to endure a 
low, pamful auditory death .

TRPI says blacks, Latinos 

shut out by UC policy 
By NEIL SPEARS 
Contributing Writer 

The Toma Rivera Polley 
Instirute released a new srudy on UC 
acceptance rates of racial minoritie 
on March -, adding more fuel to the 
fiery debate surrounding affinnati,'c 
action and college admissions. 

The rudy reveals that since the 
Implementation of race-blind 
admissIons In 1998, acceptance 
rates for Laonos and blacks ha,'e 
fallen dramaocally. 

According t~ the study, the 
overall UC acceptance rate for 
Lanno dropped 16.5 percent Ince 
the end of admissions proces~e. 
that factor in race. Acceptance of 
blacks dropped 20.5 percent. 

The srudv also IIldlcates that If 
1997 accepta'nce rates had remamed 
constant, -,530 more Laonos and 
I, 29 more blacb \\ ould have been 
accept(;d to L'C

Allison pointed out that the

"It's hard for me to see research

people leaving these boxes and ay-

said.

Tolan said. 

Both candidate were running 
on the Unity slate headed by pres-
Idential candidate Jeremy 
Gallagher, 

"I'm really saddened that the 
bureaucracy IS keepmg people 
who really want a chance to be in 
A.S. Out of these elections," 
Gallagher said, "I understand that 
there are certain rules, but there 
are excepuons that need to be 
made." 

Gallagher also pomted out "a 
lack" of candidates thiS year With 

several pOSitiOnS runl1lng unop-

THURS[)AY, MARCH 13, lOO} THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Slates: Voluntary pending limits in effect 
cununuea [rom paRe 3 

Uiga said that hiS slates plat-
form. the TNSFUAPWSS, is 
based on the idea that anyone can 
run for president or vice president. 

One noticeable feature of this 
year's election, Shelton noted, was 
the various positions for which can-
didates were running unopposed. 
The e include Rigo Marquez of the 
Students First! slate for vice presi-
dent external, Perse Hooper of che 

nldcnts First! slate for commis-
sioner of academic affairs, indepen-
dent candidate Jordan Cross for 
commissioner of athletics, Frances 

,alvon of the Student First! slate 
for commissioner of communica-
tions, h:elly Vasant of the Unity sla te 
for commiSSioner of student ser-
"Ices, Jeremy Cogan of the nity 
slate for commissioner of enterprise 
operations ,md Vivlane Poura7ary of 
the Students First! slate for commiS-
sioner of snldent advocacy. 

Several senatc positions arc also 
runnll1g unoppo\cd, and there arc 
no candidates for the position of 

John MUir ' ollegc Jllnlor senator. 
"I think there's no 'luestlon that 

it makes It difficult when YOIl only 
have one chOice as a voter," Shelton 
said, 

Another difference in elections' 
bylaws this year is the recently 
approved voluntary spending lim-
its, which asked each candidate to 
sign a statement accepting or 
declining limits to thclr campaign 
spendi ng. The voluntary limits cap 
off at $200 for slate candidates run-
ning for executive and commission-
er posi tions, $75 for slate ca ndi-
dates running for sena te posi tions, 
$500 per person for independcl1l 
execulive and commissioner candi-
dates and $175 per person for inde-
pendent senate candidates, 

"I wouldn't say It's a benefit for 
Independent cal;dldates, but u's 
morc tryang to Icvcl the phlying 
field," Shelton said. 

' !lvo referendums ",Ii I also he 
appearing on thi\ }'ear'~ ballot, onc 
asking students whether or not they 
wOllld support comnllSSloner pml-

tions being appointed by the A.S. 
Council rather than elected. 

"If students VOle for thiS, it 
won't be taking thc student's vOice 
away, slIlce they vote for the Scnate 
that would appoint these commi~­
sioners," said Revelle Freshman 
Senator Carrie Du, one of 10 se na-
tors who proposed the change. 
"Commissioners SOrt of run like a 
business in that they provide er-
vice , so the Sena te should be able 
to Interview them and choose the 
best ones for the job." 

The second referendum will ask 
students to approve or disapprove 
of a $6.75 increase in fees aimed to 
go toward expansion projects . 

2003 elections Will take place 
from April 7 to April II wich votes 
cast via SrudentLlIlk. The carn-
p:tlgnll1g pef/od begin!, at the end of 
spring break at 8 p.m. on ,\Iarch 30. 
In contrast, campaigrung III 2002

According to Shelton, thiS change is 
intended to help bnng focus to the

'drastically 

underfunded' 
Beza says 

COlllllllled [rom Plll!.C 7 
organization national competition 
travel funding, according to Beza. 
As a result, the FOC recommended 
that "fund~ for tudent organiza-
tion, prognllnming, media and 
travel be significantly increased in 
order to effectively fund at least 60 
percent to 70 percenr of all 
requests, remove current spending 
caps ... and encourage more student 
orgartizations to hold programs." 

"Student organizadons are 
drastically underfunded," Beza 
said. "A.S. has grown a lot recently 
and we haven't addressed the 
financial need of that growth ." 

The FOC also conveyed the 
need to mallltain the Student 
Initiated Outreach and 
Recruitment Commission's ability 
to fund its programming requests 
at its current level, de pite cuts in 
state funding to SrORc. 

F members noted, however, 
that there is no guarantee that next 
year's council would allocate tudent 
activity funds in accordance with 
FOC recommendations, even if Stu-
dents approve the fcc referendum. 

During the FO presentatIOn, 
several A . . Council l1lelllb~rs 
que tioned whether (1 $7 increase 
might be more appea ling to stu-
dents because it is a more rounded 
figure . The FO representatives 
re ponded by saymg theIr goal was 
to keep the tudenr activity fee a~ 
low as possible. 

oon after, Revelle College 
Council ChaIr Alex chafgans 
asked the committee members if 
this was the best quarter to address 
an actl \~ty fee IIlcrease. Brown 
defended the referendum's timing 
by contendlllg that the issue should 
have been addressed last year, as 
last year's council left the current 
A.S. Council in "bad shape." 

The A.S. Council approved the 
referendum question by a vote of 
16- 1 with one abstenoon. A list 
presenting pros and cons of the 
$6.75 fee increa e will appear next 
to the referendum que tion.

Communication dept. 
passes resolution 

Faculty and staff oppose United 
States' pre-emptive strike of Iraq 

Costa Verde: Petition being circulated 
continued [rom page / 

first I've heard of it, and I've 
talked to over 70 reSIdents who 
ha ve gone down to the leasing 
office and complained." 

Givens has created a petition, 
which he says asks that Costa 
Verde reconsider changing their 
policy, due to the fact that many 
reSIdents have signed leases that 
explicitly state that there will be 
unassigned parlcing. The petition 
requests that one parking space be 
given to each resident, rather than 
one space per bedroom, or that 
residents be granted the right to 
back out on their lea e. 

By MEAGHAN FIELD 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD Department of 
Communication drafted a resolution 
opposing the war in [raq on Feb. 26. 
The resolution was accepted by the 
cndre department, department chair 
Geoffrey Bowker said. 

"We felt that we had a 'conununi-
cation' spin on the events currently 
unfolding," Bowker said. 

The resolution opposes the war 
based on the Bush administration's 
lack of convincing evidence of a 
mjlatary threat by Iraq. It says that 
such actions would be "completely 
unjustified and morally reprehen-
sible." 

The communication depart-
ment's resolution focuses on the 
lack of debate within the Bush 
administration. It cites the pres-
ence of debates within the public, 
in the media and public demonstra-
tions, and deplores what it says is a 
dismissal of dissent by the current 
administration. The White [Iou e, 
it says, partakes in one-sided com-
munication that asks the public to 
su ppOrt the wa r. 

It also discusses its oppo ition to 
the current tate of human rights in 
Iraq, which it says are deplorable. 
I Iowever, it says that this is not jus-
tification for the destructiveness 
that would occur during a conflict, 
and that there are better means to 
resolve the current Issues. The res-
olullon demands that the current 
malitary actions be Slopped Jnd 
that the admlllistratlon seek J 
peaceful solution, ay1llg It would

be "in the best interest of the world 
comnllllljty." 

According to Bowker, the initial 
resolution was drafted by a faculty 
member who then presented it to a 
group of faculty, staff and graduate 
students at a weekly department 
meeting. 

Bowker said that any member of 
the faculty or any grad student is 
welcome to bring business on any 
maner to these meetings. A subcom-
Imttee was then formed of faculty. 
staff and graduate srudents to draw 
up a linal draft of the resolution, 
based on comments made about the 
original resolution. 

Bowker said that the subcommit-
tee was drawn up because "it became 
clear at the meeti ng that there were 
some differences amongst us." 

After the final resolution was 
drawn up. there was an open cri-
tique. There was some dissent with 
the final resolution as stated. 
However, according to the resolu-
tion, the disagreement was in 
respect to certain arguments, and 
the main issue of opposition to a 
preemptive strike by the Uruted 
States was passed without dissent. 

Bowker says that he knows of no 
other department on campu 
authoring similar resolutions. 
However, other departments have 
had faculty, staff and tudents partic-
ipate individually III anti-war activi-
ties, such as the national Anti-war 
Poetry Luncheon last 1Il0nth. 

[n January, the Department of 
CommwlIty StudJes and Academic 

enate at UC anta Cruz drafted 
sllnilar re olutloll!> 0ppo 'ing the war. 

Cuevas said that Costa Verde 
has not yet officially informed res-
idents of the changes in parlcing 
policy because it is, by law, 
required to give residents 60 days 
notice of any changes. 

"We are at lea t 60 to 70 days 
away from actually assigning 
spaces," Cuevos said. 

So far, Givens' petition has 
generated some response among 
Costa Verde resi den ts. 

"1 think we've had 150 e-mails, 
100 or so people have petitions 
that they're taking around for 
people on their floors to sign," 
Givens said. "I'm impressed by 
me motivation of the residents 
here." 

Givens feels that unassigned 
parking ought to be a feature that 
Costa Verde would not want to 
lose, in terms of attracting student 
tenants. 

"A lot of srudents I've talked to 
need four or five spaces per apart-
ment," he said. "I think they 
should market the unassigned 
parking to students." 

Earl Warren College junIor 
Ayrielle Goins, a Costa Verde res-
Ident, saId that she doesn't feel 
that assiglllng tenant parlcing and 
regulating guest parking is going

to keep residents safe from poten-
tial terrorists . 

"1 heard [about the terrorist 
threat) too, but the fact of the 
matter is that if someone's going 
to pull in and blow up our build-
ing, they're not going to be able to 
stop it," she said. 

Thu rgood Marshall College 
sophomore Lauren Hopson, also a 
Costa Verde resident, said that she 
feels that the terrorist threa t could 
be a cover-up for other problems, 
which may be at the root of Costa 
Verde's parking changes. 

"They've put out notes on our 
doors about a terrorist threat to 
apartments but I thlnlc that's a lame 
excuse for all the parking changes," 
she said. "I wonder if it has more to 
do with car thefts and break-ins in 
Costa Verde garages and they don't 
want to adlm! it. That sounds like a 
more day-to-day threat man a ter-
roriSt bombing the building." 

Cuevos said that the addition 
of a signed pot and gates was 
not intended to be an increase m 
ecurity. 

GOIllS said that having to 
reserve guest parking IS an annoy-

ance for herself and her room-
mates. 

"For us, guest parlcing is a 
pain," she said. "You have to say 
the make, model, year, color and 
license plate number of the car, 
and you can only have two guests 
per apartment per day." 

Natalie Burke, a Revelle 
College junior and roommate of 
Goins, says haVIng to re-register 
guests every four days is a pain. 

" I asked [Costa Verde] If we 
had guests everyday if we could 
put them on some SOrt of perma-
nent list, but they saId they don't 
do that here," she saId. 

Hopson said that regIstering 
guests is not a problem for her. 

"It's open 24-hours-3-da)" 
seven days a week," she saId, "[t's 
not like you have to call before 10 
p.m. They just look you up In the

Overkill on a Movie 
"Red Dragon"/"Star Wars: 

Episode II" 
Hollywood has a tendency to 

take a successful idea and run it into 
the ground. "Silence of the Lambs" 
and "Star Wars" arc twO of the 
best-known and best-loved films of 
all time (i n different ways, of 
course). 

In order to bank on the succcss 
of the films, Hollywood studios 
have recently released the prequels, 
"Red Dragon" and "Attack of the 

lones," explaining the back Sto-
ries. While these two movies are 
entertaining, you walk out of the 
theater wondering why these even 
needed to be made. These two 
films are good, but the concepts are 
toO overdone. It's almost as if 
IIollywood has given up trying to 
come up with new ideas. and arc 
now JUSt reshaping the old Ideas. 

"Si lence of the Lamb " and 
"Star Wars" were good films. T hey 
still are good. But, for the sake of 
our sal1lty, someone take note: We 
don't need any more prequels or 
equeis or whatever you want to 

flaunt it as.

Cuba Gooding, Jr. 

Sometimes you look at an actor or an actress and wonder what happened. 
They used to have strong roles 
in good movies. Then their 
choices in roles and scripts start 
to take a rum for the worse. The 
best possible explanation is that, 
for whatever reason, they muse 
need some quick money. Well, 
this year, the award for the actor 
who must be the most hard up 
for cash goes to Cuba Gooding 
Jr. 

We aU remember when he 
had good roles, usuaUy as a sup-
porting actor. in some of 
Hollywood's more successfuJ 
movies. Gooding tint began to 
get the respect of Hollywood 

Machine." Laclung even the cheesy 
Iatsch of the 1960 verSion, let alone 
the techno-political commentary of 
II.G. Wells' actual book, this movie 
settles for special effecrs and good 
looks. 

'Neils wrote about a man whose 
invention hurls him across millen-
nia, only to witness the dimming of 
humanity into twO separate classes: 
the surface dwelling and child-like 
Eloi and the subterranean 
Morlocks. Along with further trav-
els all the way to the distant and dim 
end of the earth, Wells' accounrs of 
the time traveler constrUCt a criti-
cism about turn-of-the-century 
English society to both the past and 
the fumre, along with the Bntish 
connection to technology. 

All this is largely shelved, with -
out an attempt to update it for the 
American audience, mstead 
dwelling on a much happier and 
si mpl er romantic relationship . 
Commentary is gone, and in irs 
place is a trite and sa ppy Story that 
can't resist the temptation to throw 
in action- thriller elemenrs about 
getting back the girl.

Best Film To

"Swept Away"

Very few movies in your hfetime 
will make you cover your face with 
your hands and recoil in horror and

" wept Away" i one of those films. 
If there wa ever such a thing as 
cinematic pou .11 abuse, " wept

Best Career-Reviving 
Performance 

Charlton Heston in "Bowling for 
Columbine" 

II joklng J;ltle, Mi chael

gun control an America (or lack 
thereof) was probably the most 

expository and grou ndhrcakll1g 
Him of 2002. 

,\ 100re takes the audience on an 
informanve journcy with unlikely 
StopS along [he way; some of which 
mclude a hank where a customer 
gets a free gun for starling J nc\, 
account, Columbine IIlgh chool 
(the sight of the famous high school 
mass-shooting), the Lockheed 
Martin plant nearby and Charlton 
Heston 's residence (then president 
of the National Rille Association). 
Moore 's candid interview with 
HestOn, the star of such block-
busters as "Ben-Ilur." "The Ten 
Commandments" and "Planet of 
the Apes," IIlciudes a stunnll1g per-
formance by the old dinosaur -
enough to make anyone laugh and 
cry at the same t1tne 111 one hyster-
Ical confu ion. After que lions like, 
"\Vhy did you go II1to those towns 
where there had been school shoot-
lOgs only a day before and hold 
massive pro-NRA rallies'" 
lie ton's confused a1ences get 
longer and longer, as I f the poor 
old geezer doesn't know about the 
shooti ngs. or even the rallies for 
that matter. It' as If he thought the 
I RA preSidency was JUSt Jnother 
acti ng job - perhap a lequel to 
"Soylent Green" - and he was 
simply readlllg the SCript he was 
given. 

Heston's lack of coherency, 
alongside a damaging policy, ;~ 
reminiscent of Ronald Reagan in 
his role as pre idem of the United 
States. ThiS performance ought to 
revive Heston 's dormant career and 
bring h1m back into the limelight, 
since the impending war with Iraq 
should call for some mllldiess boob 
to yell meaningles slogans.

~ Most Overraled Film 
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" 

I t'$ great when an independent film is able to gain success and stand out amons big-budSet. mainstream 
Hollywood picturcl. "M, Big Fat Greek 
Wedding" certainly accomplished this 
goal by ranking as the fifth-highest 
grossing film of 2002. But is it really 
that great? 

The plot is a simplistic fusion of the 
ugly duckling and the problematic in-
laws (i.e. "Meet the Parents") with an 
ethnic twist. 11Us storyline has been 
done before in movies about ethnic fam-
ilies trying to accept grooms or brides 
from other countries, primarily from the 
United States. The comedy relies on 
eJtransant interactions within the 
Greek family, but even thoee seem over-
the-top at times (i.e. Wmdex 1$ a cure to 
all ailments). 

It is true that "My Big Fat Greek 
Wedding" gained most of ill spectaton 
through word-of-mouth, yet for the 

continued {rom page I I 
and a borderline inter- pecies homoerotic 
love triangle between Spirit, a mare, and a 
1 ative named Little Creek (don't ask). All of 
this amounts to ames, di playing none of

Best Movie Title Translation 
"Changing Lanes" as "Out of Control" in

Ladies and gentlemen, Il IS .1 great honor

\Vhcn these new titles are translated back

. In order to win this award, the translation 
of the English title must commul1lcate more

original title. Past winners have included 
"Babe," (1995) which was translated from a 
Chinese dialect to English as"r May Be a 
Pig, but I'm Not Stupid." Avid cinema-goers 
wi ll agree that this new title is a more appro-
pria te synopsis of the film's plot and charac· 
ters. 

But who can forget the 200 1 Winner, 
" ot Another Teen MOVIe," whose transla-
tion from pani~h," Another Stupid

award. This new title probably enhanced

Most Underrated Film 
"Insomnia" 

Corralling multiple Oscar-winners Into 
onc film isn 't always a good idea , hence 
stink-fests like "Pav it Forward" and "The 

hipping ews" (orry Mr. pacey). BIIt 
"Insomnia" manages to collect two monster 
egos, Robtn Williams and Al Pacino, and 
one promisin g newcomer, Acadcmy-anoll1t-
cd Iltllary Swank, and allow each of them to 
tlesh Ollt their characters subtly and sharply. 
Combtnc brilli .lnt actors With a brilltant 
director, hn~ Nobn of 2001 's "Memento," 
and thcy get the Job done I1tccly. 

The film begins with two L PO officers, 
Will (Pa 1110) and Ilap ( 1artln Donovan) 
traveling to an Alaskan town to aid in a mur-
der investigation. Hap IS threatening to 
reveal information, which would ruin Will's 
estimable career. A confrontation with the 
ki ller in a dense fog leads to an "accident." 
The ambiguity of the event and Will's subse-
quent guilt fuels the rest of the film . In the 
Alaskan summertime, the sun barely sets, 
and Will doe n't sleep for days. 

Giving away anything else would spoil 
the film's subtle twi ts. Swank nicely under-
plays her role a a do-gooder cop who part-
ners up with Will, naively I oking up to him. 
Williams' role as novelist and murderer 
Walter FUlch is miles away from Palch 
Adams, since his charm belies the character's 
underlying twisted nature. It's enthralling to 
wa tch William' and Pacino's interplay while 
Walter cuts into the sleepless Will. 

I ext time 1ll0VIC rcntal time comes 
along, pick up thiS tcmc, overlooked thnller.

"24 Hour Party People" 

"24-Ilour Party People," a film 
about the people and music that

the acrual scene a best he could 
and film "24-Hour Party People" 
as If it were a documentary. The 
result I a punk connoisseur's

"24-Hour P arty People" is 10 1976 
when TV reporter Tony Wilson 
(Steve Coogan) is one of 40 wit-
ne se to a concert by the then 
unknown ex PI tols. I~ thiS scene, 
It is pamfully clear that the mOVle is 
not a story about Tony 'v\'ilson, a 
hiStOry of ,\1anchester or a mani -
festo on how to be punk. ThiS is a 
film about the musIc and about the 
people who made the music possi -
ble. 

The subsequent musical revolu-
tion explosion results in a sound-
track treat. Music from the Sex 
Pistols, Joy Division, New Order 
and the Happy Mondays fill this 
movie to the musical brim. 

The film details the rise and 
abrupt end of Joy Division and its 
transforlTl2tion to New Order via 

lead singer Tan Curtis's suicide. It 
capture the llappy Mondays on 
stage for their first performance, 
and the e nergy and emotion the 
music evoked . It follows the transi -
tion of mu ic Into hou e music , and 
the music in the end cenes at the 
Hacienda grab your attention. 

"24-Hour Party People" wins 
thi year's best Music in a Movie 
Award because of the proper show-
case of the music. The beauty of 
"24-Hour Party People" is that the 
mu ic is not just a compliment to a 
scene; it is the subject for the scene. 
It is the reason that the fi lm was 
even made. The actors work with 
and around the music.

Best Cameo 
Appearances 

"Austin Powers: Gold Member " 

Courtesy of Ntw Line Clnima 

And for the Anti-Oscar Award 
for the best cameo in a fil m by an 
actor or actress being paid a ignif-
icant amount of money for a 10-
second face shot is ... May I have 
the envelope plea e ... But waitl 
First it 's time for an arbitrary flash-
back. 

Somewhere in Utah, the oblig-
atory babe in leather on a motor-

cycle i being chased by the imper-
ative-to-the-plot, gun - b lazing 
helicopter whose gunmen couldn't 
hit Texas if they were aiming at it 
with a bazooka . The secret agent, 
none other than th e man of mys-
tery himself, Austi n Powers, para-
chutes in to the driver's seat of his 
remote controlled "Shagua r." It 's 
Austin to the rescue. Austin 
Powers played by (he's so d reamy) 
Tom Cruise. T hat's right, C ruise 
in Steven Spielberg's new soon-to-
be-blockbuster hi t, "Austin 
Pussy," co-starring Gwyneth 
Palt row as the " Powers girl," 
Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil and 
Danny DeVito as M ini-Me. Any 
one of these appearances would 
have made an excellent recipient 
for the Best Cameo Award . These 
are , however, merely the runners-
up. 

Also noteworthy is the 
Osbournes' cameo. Ozzyespecia ll y 
provides some very insightful com-
mentary about the running ti ts gag. 
"They fucking did that one 
already." Apparently, this highly 
amusing ight gag is a repetition 
from the previous sequel. 

Alright, the audience has wait-
ed long enough . ThiS yea r' award 
for the Guardian Anti -Oscar 
Award for the best cameo appear-
ance in a film is the international -
ly acclaimed and beloved young 
pop s tar, Britney Spears. If eeing 
her nipples morph into gun bar-
rels whi le she tries to gu n down 
our very groovy hero isn't 
th ri ll ing enough , seeing her head 
explode in a blaze of fiery glory 
wi ll bri ng a tear to any theater-
goer's eye.

THE EFFECT OF 

Worst Performance by 
a Good Actor/Actress 
Winona Ryder in "Mr. Deeds" 

Courtesy of Columbia Pictures 

Throughout her career, 
Winona Ryder has shown that she 
is a credible actre s with notable 
performances in " Little Women" 
and "The Age of Innocence." Her 
performances demonstrated that 
he was able to perform a wide 

range of dramatic roles, and she 
delivered performances that were 
not only gripping, but also memo-
rable. So the question lhat comes 
to mind is why she chose to star in 
" Ir. Deeds." Hint: She wa prob-
ably too busy with her "extra-cur-
ricular" activltie to select a good 
role . 

Ryder plays Babe Bennett, a 
cynical reponer who will stop at 
nothing and IS willing to compro-
mi se everything to get a tory. 
Unfortunately, Ryder's character is 
nothing more than a typical, con -
fused and ethically torn he roine. 
T here is nothing memorable 
about her role and she plays It as if 
she was JUSt there for the pay-
check. 

Ben nett doesn't have much 
character development and Ryder

Best Performance by a

So what i it about Adam 
Sandler movies that brmg the 
wor t and best out of actors? Out 
frolll the usual tOilet humor of 
films such as ";\Ir. Deeds" and 
"Little ~tckv," come andler 
with an ennchmg, thoughtful yet 
dlsturbtng character in "Punch-
Drunk Love." Like Keanu Reeves 
would say: "\\ 11001 /" 

Under the dlrecrion of P.T 
Anderson, Sandler shows that 
there IS more than Just a " Bi lly 
,\1adlson" or a " llJppy Gilmore" 
to hiS acting ~hops; thel c', J per-
son beneath all the anger, yearn-

_ Best Anti-Date Movie 

"jackass: the movie" 
The self-stapling, pond-jumping, gag-pulling stunt aficionados of 
"jackass" thiJ grOll-ollt shock-
er, iJ the ultimate antithesis to 
the stereotypical date flick. 

A typical Friday night date 
film's checklist is full of 
romance, clandestine kisses 
and an overly mushy conclu-
sion. Theatergoers leave the 
movie a little teary-eyed and 
clingi ng to a date's hand, 
grateful they could partake in 
the date-movie experience. 

"jacbss: the movie," how-
ever, is devoid of romance, 
unless your idea of a really sen-
sual time is taking a bowling 
baD to the groin. In the open-
ing credits, the "jacbss" men 
ride an enormous shopping 
can (that some poor craftsman 
bad to construct j \1St for this 
purpose) iJlto an oversized 
fruit stand. Bodies and bananas 
go flying, and dramatic music 
ends the sequence nicely. 

10 another decidedly unro-
mantic scene, the lovable 
Steve-o decides the normal 
process of getting a tattoo 
lacks off-rOiding. A crew piles 
into a Jeep and bounces over 
uneven lands as a tlIttoo artist 
dnws a happy face on Steve-
o's bicep. In this exemplary 
scene, Stcve-o combines pain, 
idiocy and pennanence all in 
one messy little stunt. 

Ar. for an overly mushy con-
clusion to -jadcass; the movie," 
Bam Margcn could have used 
something a Ii ttle softer than a 
toy car to jam up an unmen-
tionable orifice, later to be 
passed through his bowels. 
Needless to say, the end of the 
cinematic achievement that is 

~jackass" pushes much of the 
audience to cover their eyes in 
horror and disgust. 

So, for all the pain, toilet 
humor and general havoc, 
kjackass" takes the proverbial 
caIce for Anti-D ate Movie of 
the Year.

story. A struggling actor moves 
home with his son. It's really about 
what I went through when I came 
home from college. After a year or 
so of being at home, my father took 
the phone jacks out of the house and 
put a pay phone In the hVlng room, 
he put a pay washer and dryer In the 
garage, he told me that I had to buy 
my own food . Once I did that, he 
SUrted putting padlocks on all the

good in concert. but that IS not the 
case with the Knoxville, Tenn., rock 
quartet Superdrlg. Although two 
of the founding members have 
left since the last time they played 
in San Diego, Superdrag can still 
rock like no other. Their melodic 
songs exude energy and exCite-
ment that is highly contagious.

Let's boogie! So it might 

sound lame: a disco-dance party. 
But it definitely is not lame if you 
are into good music and great

Cially if you pass by The casbah

like. And what's even better? 
There's no cover. Hot Club of

tindive rock flavor that cannot be 
missed. See them when they play

field line, plating Hernandez. 
"We are playing pretty good 

baseball right now," said UCSO 
head coach Dan O'Brien. "We def-
initely can get better, and we lare} 
looking to eliminate some mi takes 
and be more consistent. But we 
played pretty well in the end, and 
while we are not contelll with the 
outcome, we will takc the two wins 
and move on." 

In the game, Hernandez went 
3-for-5, including a pair of run-
scoring doubles, and Burron and 
Merrifield added four and three 
hit , respectively. 

The Tritons stole a total of nine 
bases in the game. Riddle, Hawk, 
Burton, I lernandez and Albrecht 
each stole one base whi le Fante 
stole three on the da y. 

"We always pride ourselves on 
being a great baserunning team," 
O'Brien said earlier thi yea r. U\Ve 
feel like if we can steal some free 
bags, we don 't have to sacrifice bunt, 
and we can star out of double plays. 
We have great baserunners in thl 
program." 

UCSD pitcher Andy Ilolloway 
(1-0) picked up his first win of the 
season, throwrng 4.2 rnnings of 
relref for starter TOlllmy Sereno. 

To play a game that was 
rescheduled for March II due to

Triton crushed Concordia 13-6. 

After four 1I11l1ngs of phlY, the

works very hard to ensure that teams 
are placed where they deserve to be. 
Although it may be trendy to pick

are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fixed percentage 
of future income for a fixed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

and hbin did an awesome Job. He has been extremely helpful, and IS 
always there (or you! We trusted him to find a p lace of our son dnd so 
should you." - Sh~ldon & ~ra Ann Sdtl!rwin 

Question: Can these Education Investments pay for all of my tuition? 

Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 
have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need without the 
debt burden. REEF will pay upto $7000 to UCSD on your behalf. 

Question: How does this affect my Financial Aid package? 

Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 
REEF works closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to ensure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you know 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
sensitive to your future ability to pay. 

Question: How are these percentage rates detemined? Will they change 
throughout the life of the obligation? 

Answer: Percentage rates begin: 
0.01·/. for graduate students (11100 of one percent) 
0.02·/. for undergraduate students (1150 of one percent) 

Rates are specific to each applicant. The more information a student 
gives REEF, the more accurately a rate is determined. tudents are 
encouraged to inform REEF about their goals, ca reer plan, intern hip , 
major, test scores, CPA and anything else they think is relevant 
regarding their future.

Tritons beat Redlands, VCI and fall to LMV, SJSU in weekend tournament 

By DANIEL DiAl 
Staff Writer 

Usmg the second half to rejuve-
nate Its game, the women's w3tcr 
polo team picked up rwo victorie in 
four pmes for a lOth-place finish at 
the UC ama Barbara Invitational 
on 1arch 8 and March 9 

The Tmons snuggled eJrlr 111

breaker to conference nval Loyola 
Marymount before rebounding later 
m the day to defeat Redlands. 
UCSD':. momentum proved to be 
cruCial m the next day's overtime \1C-
tory over U Irvine, but the Tritons 
failed to overcome an early five-goal 
deficit over San Jose tate, despite a 
strong second-half comeback. 

"We played some good games," 
said Triton head coach Larry 

anders about UC D's tournament 
performance. "\-\le played ILM 
and Sj U] to the Wire, but we spot-
ted them toO many goals carlyon." 

UC D's weekend began on a 
brighter note when the Tritons took 
conunand of the final rwo quarter 
to defeat UC Irvine -4 on March 6. 
The Anteaters held the lead for most 
ot the fir t half, com'crong on all 
four of their 6-on-5 man-up alh'an-
tage, The Tmom kept them,e!ve, 
m the galll~ With twO goals from 
Daruelle Boyle and one goal from

back With two goab uf their own to 
make the score 12 - 11 With 3-40 left 
III the final quarter. 

But no matter how hard UeSD 
fought , thiS game Just wasn't meant

the ' I r1tons had numcruus oppOrtu-

man-up wa~ unable to convert nn 

U 0 turned up the heat with an 
aggravanng press dcfense that frus-
trated the UCI players. ' Ine TrilOns 
controlled the game from that point, 
takmg the advantages given to them 
by UCl's flagrant fouJing and scor-
II1g five unanswered goals to caprure 
the \1 lOr)'. Ren,lc oulter, Meris 
Bamdan- 'rruth, Lesha Bounds and 
amara SlIvemlan each picked up a 

goal m the sconng flurry. 
" I clawed and scratched at 

us, but we kept our cool, turncd up 
the mtenslry and we took control," 

Ilverman ·ald. 
After UCSD opened up tourna-

ment play, the Tritons looked for-
ward to displa}~ng their capabilities 
in their March opening match 
agalllst LM ,which is widely con-
sidered to be the team to beat tillS 
year in the \\'estern INater Polo 

oclanon. After the Lions picked 
up three goals III the fir t half, 

C D answered back With goals 
from Tucker and Eli zabeth 
Kee e}~n, to stay only a goal behind 
at 3-2. The Tmons kept knocking 
on the door for most of the game, 
but couldn't punch 111 any more 
goal,. LMU managed three more 
scor" III the la~t six mInutes to end 
all hope of a UC D Will, endmg the 
game \\1th a score of 6-2. The loss 
was a tough one for UCSO, but the 
Tnton picked up grcat confidence 
III knowlI1g that they could run \\Ith 
some of the beSt 111 their pack. 

"We played LA1U tough, and 
they're definitely beatable," 

anders said. "They're not the 
machine that some think they are, 
anJ we can't wait to play them 
again." 

The Tntons moved on to their 
next game aga inst Redlands, get-
ting the after-effects of the loss out 
of their system en route to a 7-3 
victory. After a slow first quarter, 
UCSD took the lead and never 
looked back. The Tritons were 
fueled by two goals each from 

ilverman and Bantilan- mith. 
The victory propelled UCSD 

into a rematch with UC Irvine on 
March 9. This dme, however, 
things were a lot more competitive, 
with the Anteater and Tritons 
pushing each other to the limit. 

C D held a 6-5 lead goi ng into 
the fourth quarter, but UCI scored 
a goal to send the game into over-
ome. UCSD picked up the goal in 
sudden death, giving them a hard-
earned 7-6 triumph . Bantilan-

mith led the Triton with three 
goals 111 the conte t. 

Only rwo hours later, UCSD 
looked to defeat San Jose State and 
filllsh a strong 3-1 for the tourna-
ment, but fatigue caught up with 
the players, and the Tritons fell 111 
another shootOut 9-8. After spot-
ting the Spartans a 5- 1 lead at the 
end of the fir t quarter, the Tritons
