Severa! bills potentially 
detrimenta! to .tudents have 
been defeated in the 
Assembly amid the frantic 
scrambling of California 
lawmakers to get hundreds of 
bills out of committee before 
the 30·day deadlinf' that 
would kill them. 

The most discriminatory 
was AB 2031. sponsored by 
Assemblyman Dick Mount-
joy (R-L.A.). which specified 
that .tudents in public post-
secondary institutions who 
are convicted of certain 
crimes be manditorily 
expelled from school for 
three years. 

Conviction of rioting. 
incitement to riot. or 
participation in a riot. or 
felony or mi.demeanor 
involving assault on a police 
officer were the crimes 
singles out in the Mountjoy 
bill. 

There was little question 
that the bill was aimed at 
causing rabble-rousing 
foreign students to lose their 
student status. and 

con~uently. their student

Outvoted 
visas. 

The bill had been defeated 
last month in sub.committee. 
but in a rare procedural 
maneuver. Mounijoy asked 
for re·consideration of the bill 
before the full Education 
committee. in order to 
correct testimony given 
during the subcommittee 
hearing. 

Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos (D.San Jose). 
once chairman of the 
subcommittee that rejected 
the Mountjoy bill. once again 
voiced strong opposition to 
the bill. 

"It would impinge 
inequitably on those students 
attending public in.titution .... 
said Vasconcellos. "Students 
attending USC or Santa 
Clara. or any other private 
college could riot at will 
without being expelled from 

school. Secondly. it i. 
inappropriate to add on a 
.eparate and unrelated 
penalty . to 10m eone 
convicted of a crime in a 
court of law." 

Even during the second 
consideration. the bill. which 
needed seven votes to pass. 
c nly drew three affirmative 
votes. from Mounijoy and 
two co-authors. Roger 
Hayes (R-L.A.). and Don 
Rogers (R-Kern). 

Also defeated was AB 
2305 by Auemblyman 
Bruce Young (D-L.A.). a bill 
which would have lowered 

the minimum wage for 
workers under the age of 21 by 
20%. 

Instead of paying the 
current $3.1 O/hour. the 
Young bill would have 
permitted employer. to pay 
worker. under 21 an hourly 
wage of $2.48. Emling

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
There is one quiet issue at the heart 

of the Constructive Action slate's AS 
campaign at a predominantly white. 
middle class school. 

It isn't mentioned much by their 
opponents. but Robert Cunningham-
Tambuzi. who leads the slate as its 
presidential candidate. is delighted to 
take on the question. 

"We're not running as affirmative 
action candidates. or Third World 
candidates." Tambuzi says. 

"We're ruMing as students who can 
bring some respect to the AS. It· s been 
sadly lacking that over the past few 
years."

BY JOHN KLOCK 
A consistent theme of AS 

Presidential candidate Rusty Wright is 
the behavior of the present AS 
members. Although he doesn't claim to 
have any solution for the entire 
organization. he criticizes members as 
being irresponsible and immature and 
says he can do better. 

"If you want to know what I me..,.

Hyman - Who 
Wants An AS 
Conscience? 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
There was a consensus among AS 

Council members last year that Barry 
Hyman. who was running for AS 
President then as now. would not be a 
very good president. 

"He picks all those fights with Ann 
Carberry (then AS Vice President) . 
Who will he fight with if he gets 
elected? He11 be the authority." one 
council member said. 

Hyman. who served two years on 
the council as Student Welfare 
Commissioner. developed a reputation 
as someone whose heart was in the 
right place. but who often followed that 
heart down long and infuriatingly 
tangled parliamentary and personal 
paths. Hyman once sponsored a 
resolution accusing the council 
members of being racist. When they 
objected. he said the attack wasn't

Little - Larger Issues For AS:

Staff Writer 

John Little. a math major at 
Revelle College. is running for AS 
President because he is concerned 
about the environment. "the epidemic 
of cancer" and "insuring the free 
exchange of ideas. " 

Little does not see Proposition 9 as 
one of the major issues facing the 
Univer.ity. A.ked how he would 
approach the problem presented by 
Prop, 9. Little said he was "not really

and Regi.tration Fees. 

Little doe. ' not believe theae two 

goals are contradictory. "There 
appear to be many possibilities 
(besides raising tuition). With the 
University receiving over $100 
million in research every year. 
somehow or another academia 
should be able to procure part of these 
funds to make up for any loases 
resulting from Prop 9 ."

Thus. Collver's open espousal of Western 
separatism and union with the US cannot be 
dismissed as the ravings 01 a crank. Collver has 
taken Western separatism out of the closet. 
giving it a hitherto unknown respectabitity. He 
has managed, in one stroke. to crystalize anti· 
Central Canada sentiment, which haa 
influenced much of Western politics since 
World War II. 

"It'. time," Colver Mid at a recent news 
conference, "that people understood that we 
are not prepared to put up with. . . French 
power. Ontario power, or any other kind of 
power. We want to be able to control our own 
destinies and we don't want to be controled by 
the Toronto-Ottawa axis." 

That Collver should look beyond leparatiam 
to union with the United States is not surpriaing 
in the Ieaat. His critics charge he is more 
American than Canadian. In lact, CoOver owns

R t 1 AS doesn t make it sometimes, and that espec ,or makes him reluctant to go along with 

Continued from page 1 
While every member of the slate is 

from a minority group, Tambuzi 
dismisses that as irrelevant. 

"The important thing is that they're 
active and interested in politics," he 
says. 

H T ambuzi is trying to play down 
race, other candidates, subtly, are 
not. 

Tambuzi says the "S tudent 
Interests, Not Special Interests" slate is 
trying to paint his group as for "special 
interests" because of its connection 
with the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee. 

(Linda Sabo, who heads the SISI 
slate, denies the charge, saying they 
were considering the name long before 
they knew T ambuzi was a candidate.) 

"That doesn't bother us ," Tambuzi 
says, "We're going to win anyway." 

If he does win, he will be the first 
Black AS President. He is already the 
first Black candidate. 

Tambuzi is chairman of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee. 

the compromise, but he often can get 
what he is looking for just by arguin~ 
for a long time about what he wants, ' 
one SAAC member says. "He's 
awfully stubborn about some things." 

Tambuzi cites his SAAC experience 
as one of his most important 
qualifications for the post, but says 
what he has learned at SAAC -
dealing with administrators, student 
constituencies, etc. - will help him in 
working on non· minority related 
problems as well. 

"There are five different areas to 
affirmative action, and those apply to 
any student on this campus, no matter 
his nationality. They are recruitment, 
retention, education, getting professors 
of color, and tenure. What I learned on 
SAAC in working for those things 
helps all students," Tambuzi says. 

iambuzi's campaign platform is 
vague - he's against Proposition 9, 
and says the AS "will fight it," and he's 
against tuition - but he says the AS 
itself is a major issue.

Got A Plan

personal, but that he thought there 
should be some public discussion of 
their problem. Would they care to talk 
it out in the council? Had they ever had 
any dose friends who were poor? 
Hyman asked. 

They hadn't, and they didn't want to 
talk about it very much, either. 

"He's sort of the conscience of the 
council," the representative said. 
" What will he do if no one likes that , 
like this year?" 

Hyman's concern that "parliamen. 
tary bullshit" was enveloping the 
council often drove him outside the AS 
rules, alienating those who might 
otherwise agree with his usually "pure" 
motives. 

But Hyman had an answer for them 
last year. 

He didn't ~ant to be a president in 
the same senle Carlos Montalvo 
wanted to be president. Hyman said he 
wanted to be president so that he could 
preside over a substantial dismantling 
of AS projects. 

5 

for the second straight year, calls for 
one· third of AS revenue to go to 
campus media, one· third to student 
organizations and one· third to the AS 
bureaucracy, i.e ., its commissioners. 

That would about triple the amount 
of money allocated to media, and cut 
'substantially into the commiuioners' 
budgets , but Hyman thinks it will make 
the AS a better student organization. 

"What we have now is students 
working against other students," 
Hyman says. 

"They run against each other in 
elections and they're not working 
together on projects. We should make 
the AS an organization that helps bring 
other organizations together . 

"All that money doelm;t have to go 
to the AS bureaucracy. It can go to a 
dub or an organization that wants to 
fight Proposition 9, for example. They 
can get some of the money that Roes to 
the commissioners now, and the ,new 
indicator could help them publicize it 
because they'd be getting rnoremoney, 
too." 

Hyman, a Visual Arts and 
Communications double ~ajor, think. 
that he can win - he Only got 22 
percent last year, coming in third 01 
three candidates - but is more worried 
about hill idea for fund distribution. 

By most accounts, he has been an

This Time Rec Center 
May Get Needed Vote 
Last Year's Timing Held Turnout 
Down Too Low, But Price Up 

BY JON GOETZ 
!Italf Wri .... 

Though canlpua survey. 
have alway. .hown a desire 
for more recreation facilities, 
apecific propo.a1s have alway, 
run into problems at the poDs. 
Thi. week'. balloting on the 
latell plan, euentially the 
.ame as last spring'" has 
probably the beat chance of 
passage of any. 

scheduled for May 23-24, was 
delayed a week beeause of AS 
problem. with .taging the 
election, de.pite the AS', 
effort to postpone the 
balloting until fall. 

Thi. year rec center 
tupporlerl are banking on 
getting the nonnally higher 
turnout that a general election 
bring., generally in the 
neighborhood of the required 
25 percent. Facilities 
committee member Mike 
EIcan il also hopina for a high 
graduate and -SIO .tuclent 
turnout. 

The Daily Guardian T~y, ApriI22, 1980

Four·fifths of lut year'. 
voter. endoned the proposal 
to conabuct a complex with 
five racquetball courts, a pool, 
a jacuzzi, and a shower 1"0011, 
and also inataII IJricht night 
IiahtinI on Muir FJeld. But the 
turnout in the 10th week 
lpeCiai election - only 13 
percent - was far below the 
25 percent neceaaary to make 
the vote binding. 

Puaage of the referendum 
would start construction of the 
new facilitiea on a vacant ,trip 
of land on the north tide of 
Miramar Road, acroll from 
Warren west field. 

SITE PLAN - IECREATION FACILITES 

The 10th week 01 the 
quarter "is hiatorically avery 
bad week for elections," aayd 
Student Recreation F acilitie. 
Committee member Blake 
Waltrip. . 

Last .pring'. election had 
the disadvantage of not being 
affiliated with any other AS 
propo.al. or electiona, 
reducing the turnout. Some 
.tudents reported being 
confu.ed at the AS 
maneuvering of the referen· 
dum. 

The election, originally 

When the new courts and 
pools are ready, ltudents wiD 
be charged a mandatory 
$6.50 fee tacked on to the 
quarterly feel. The new center 
.hould be ready for .tudent use 
in fall, 1982. 

COlts for this year's plan 
have risen from the $5 figure 
in lut apring'. election due to 
inflation and a hike in state 
intere.t on loans. But at 11 
percent interest for 25 years, 
the rate i. will below the 
current prime lending rate of 

around 20 percent. Facility 
planner. have relied on a 20 

eer~nt inflation. rate in 
figuring conatrucbon coats, 
thus arriving at the $6.50 
figure. 

Even with increuing co.ts, 
the committee is very 
optimistic about passage this 
time around. Mo.t evet')'one, 
even traditional opponent Jon 
Bekken of the new indicator 
and Progressive Coalition, 
agrees that this is the best 
'written proposal to face the 
UCSD electorate, though 
Bekken .till opposes levying 

students for the construction. 
The only maior change from 
lut year'l proposed charter is 
the spelling out of the .tudent 
governintL committee's exact 
duties. The new proposal 
guaranteel that the students 
wiD have control over the 
facilitiea' budget. 

Bekken joined the 
Recreation Committee this 
year and helped impose these 
guidelines. As a result, this 
week's proposal hal no 
organized opposition this year. 
The new indica lor also have a 
conditional endorsement in its 

latest issue, saying in its 
"Charles Patterson-Funky La 
Job" column that "thi. time 
around the .tructure isn't too 
bad, and the facility could be 
uadul." Their only argument 
is with the COlt, which they 
term as excessive in an era of 
limited government and 
inadequate housing. 

Bekken is concerned that 
the passage 01 Proposition 9 
(Jarvis II) could leave the 
facilities lacking funds. If a 
tuition is imposed, he says, 
"You're going to suddenly 
have people dropping out."
