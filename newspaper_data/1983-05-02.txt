There Once Was a Man

The UCSD Studellt Cellter is 
a group 01 organizations tliat is 
entirely lunded, controlled, alld

This L'i the story 01 a powerful 
man who didll 't like illhis way. 

Once upon a time, at a large 
university situated among 
groves of eucalyptus trees 
there lived a man of great 
power and control. He was the 
university's chancellor of 
undergraduate affail s. HIS 
name was Joe Watson. 

He did n't act uallv hve. but 
rat her reigned t here. He wou Id 
\vork endle!'>sly. cancelling

e\ erything fell into place 
;\1any people kne\\ of thIS man . 
They knev,: of hi s goal: 
complete adminIstrative 
power. They knew of hIS 
miss ion In order to obtain that 
goal: shut down s tudent 
opinion. At this unJversit~ 
wa a tudent Center which 
had been controlled for some 
time by the administration. 
The student. . who paid for the 
construction and use of this 
Center, did not feel it was fair 
that they couldn't run it. They 
were upset with the way the 
adminis tration was handling 
the Center. One time the 
administration used the 
students' money for the 
Student Center to pay back a 
huge debt incurred by the Food 
Services Department. This 
money was never returned to 
the students. 

Finally, in' 1979. th e 
students \\ere allowed to 
control their Student Center. 

Within a year and a half of 
the change in control, the 
Student Center underwent 
enormous grc)\\ th o The Pub

the (Jeneral ' t ore Co·op \\ ere

faculty and staff to help "run " 
the facility. All decisions made 
by anyone would not be 
implemented, however, unless 
he accepted them . He wanted 
to provide an "assbtant vice 
chancellor of the university 
center" to control the new 
center. He would control the 
assistant VICe chancellor of the 
university center. 

He put together a group to 
examinl' the current Student 
Center and the future of the 
University Center. He called 
this group the Task Force. 
What was fascinating about 
this group was its very 
tructure. There were only 

t wn students among it s eight 
members. The rest were 
administrators and faculty. 
Considering that the ' tudent 
Center was constructed with

Inequality: Third World 
Working Class Students 
An Open Letter to Stu-
dents: 

Over the past period of time, 
attacks on our right to an 
education have increased. Fee 
hikes, cuts in financial aid , 
att acks on affi rmative action 
programs and ethnic studies 
have forced many Third World 
(minority) and working class 
students to the edge of and 
even out of higher education. 
We, as students, have sat by 
and accepted these onslaughts 
long enough. Our backs are 
against the wall and it is time 
to fight back. We, t he 
Educational Rights Commit-
tpe of the Asian/Pacific 
Student Alliance at UCSD, are 
angry. frustrated and 
prepared to demand and fight 
for our right to an education! 

In raising fees, the regents 
are ucceeding in their effort 
to reclaim the universities as 
an in titution for the affluent. 
Evidence of this can be seen in 
the median family income 
figures of UC ~tudents. For 
example. in 1981. the median 
famIly income at UC was 
estimated at above $30.000. In 
1982, the median family 
income for entering freshmen 
\\ as 0\ er SSO.OOO. 

While educational costs 
have risen. financIal aid has 
been cut back tremendously. 
Guaranteed Student Loans 
(GSL) for graduate students. 
National Direct Student Loans 
(NDSL) and upplemental 
Educational Opportunity 
Grants (SEOG) will be totally 
eliminated by next Fall. Pell 
Grants. GSL for undergrad-
uates and Work·Study 
programs have been drasti-
cally cut back. This puIs Third 
World and working class 
people at an even greater 
dIsadvantage. [n the past. 
financial aid allowed some of 
us to meet the already hIgh 
educational costs. Now, when 
\\ e need It more than e,er, It is 
being taken away. 

In this ~ituati on some 
student s ha\'e had to resort to 
getting more than one Job (if 
they can find one! ) while still 
carr\'lng a full academic load 
- and they are still having 
problems meeting theIr 
expenses. Others hare had to 
completel y drop out. The 
pressures are increaSIng just 
to sun. ive. 

In addItIOn to ", plraltng 
educal10n a l CO'i ts and 
dWIndlIng financial aId, 
attacks on ThIrd World and 
wurklllg class people have 
Increased in other areas. The 
state and the llC Hegents have 
again ~hown theIr lack of 
commitment by di ~mantling 
and eliminatmg Affirmative 
Action programs, such as the 
Educat IOnal Opportunity 
Program (EO P). These 

program~ grew out of the 
demands and struggles made 
by Third World and progres-
sive people in the 1960" and 
1970's. [n the educatIOnal 

system, these struggles won 
the right to a more affordable 
and relevant education for 
those who have historically 
been denied access to the 
educational system - i.e., 
Third World and working 
class people. Now, whi le the 
student movement has been 
relatively Ie s active, the 
regents think they can take 
these programs away. 

As a blatant example of the 
lac k of commitment to 
affirmative action. Filipinos 
face e limination as an 
affirmative action target 
group. This means that 
Filipino would no longer be 
actively included in affirma-
tive action programs. For 
example, at UCSD, Filipino 
have already been "de-
emphasized" as a target group 
for EOP recruitment. Filipinos 
have already been effectively 
eliminated from affirmative 
action at UCSD. 

The elimination of Filipinos 
from affirmative action was 
carried out without the input 
and involvement of the 
Filipino community. It was 
based solely on the regents' 
definition of "parity." 
According to the regents. 
panty IS reached when the 
percentage of high school 
graduates of a nationality 
equals the percentage of 
entering college freshmen. 
This method does not account 
for the historic denial of 
education for ThIrd World 
people. The elimination of 
Filipinos from affirmative 
action perpetuates the myth 
that Asians have "made it " in 
the US and have no obstacles 
in their path for "success." 
Filipinos now join Japanese 
and Chinese a~ the mythical 
"model minority ." This 
further s the continuing 
inequality all Third World 
people face in the U . 

The above is lit tie more than 
an identification uf the attacks 
facing Third World and 
wo rkIng c las;. people. 
Ho\\ eyer. If we stop here our 
"concern" will ultimately 
mean nothing. We must all 
move forward and take a stand 
- to organize and fight for our 
right to an education! 

Third World . working class 
and progres;'l vc ;,t udents - it 
is time to organize in your 
respecti\'(' communit ie., and 
demand your educatIonal 
right. The A:-.ian PaCIfi C

Letters to the Editor 

A Much Appreciated GuardianCritique 
Editor: 

I am writing this letter 
because I am disappointed 
with the Quality of our 
Guardian. Qua lity with 
re peet to the coverage or lack 
thereof, that you have shown 
in reporti ng events this 
academic year. And quality as 
defined by the reliabi lity of 
in formation printed and the 
apparent lack of jud iciali ty in 
appreciating the consequences 
that may result from this 
information. 

The Guardian has more 
than once shown an ineptness 
in reporting campus happen-
ings. The foremost example of 
this occurred in the April 25 
issue. when instead of printing 
the AS plection results in a 
coherent table on the front 
page. you relegated them to the 
middle of the paper. on page 
nine. You, chose, instead. to 
write a sensational article on 
the controversy surrounding 
the eit"ction. There was a run-
off for the president's seat on 
the AS; many people who rely 
on the Guardian for 
information on school politics 
were not aware of this. With 
thegreat apathy that pervades 
thIS campus. why did you not 
have a headltne below the 
Guardian masthead telling us 
this and when we could vote 
again to decide the winner? 
(An example of this could have 
been. RUN-OFF ELECTro , 
VOTE WEDNESDAY.) It 
seems to me that you only 
helped contribute to a low 
voter turn-out. Further, why 
did vou wait until the last 
iSHue before the election to 
present the candidates' views 
(some flf which, I've been told 
by on candidate, were taken 
out of context)? Why did you 
not present the candidates for 
the pr('<;idency like you did 
with the city mayoral 
candidates? The AS presiden-
cy affects us as studel/ts much 
more than San Diego"i mayor 
does. 

On t hat same note. why are 
there most always national or 
CIt y issues discussed on the 
fn;nt pages of the (;ual'dial1? 
The economics of our military 
defen .... e or our gO\ernment's 
presem'(' in E I Sa I vador a re not 
so ImlX)rtant to U'i as sludellls 
(though t hey are, or should be. 
as C1tilt' ns of the US) when 
compared to programming. 
plus/ minus gradingor campus 
politics. There i<; a news 
sect Ion tn the Guardian for 
city, state, and nat ional 
events. Thenameofourpaper 
is Tile UCSD Guardiflli. not 
US Nel(ls u/Ui W()rld Rep()ri. 

Intertwi ned with the issue 
of covcnngevents lX'rl lllent to 
us as studen ts is the not ion of 
the [('liab Il ity of vour 

reporting those events. The 
Reggie Williams incident was 
inc red ibly bungled by the 

Guardio~1 staff. Al though I do 
not agree with Mr. Will iams' 
poli tics and ways of worki ng, 
I, nevertheles ,believe that he 
was not given a fair shake in 
yo u r coverage of that 
"scandal." Indeed, he was not 
even approached for comment 
on h is dea lings. As it turned 
out, your story was found to be 
fa llacious by the AS boss that 
investigates such matters . 
Your unreliable reporting has 
led to a SUIt brought again -t 
you (and others) by Mr. 
Williams and prompted the 
resignation of Cuordiall l'<litor 
Scott Young. 

Instead of making sure 
sources are correct and 
information is solid, the 
Guardiul/ seems more 
interested in the practice of 
"yellow journalism ." The 
Williams incident is one case. 
The November 18. 1982. 
artIcle by Dr. Swee Chal Ang 
which had a machine gun on 
the front page is yet another. 

Last week the Guardian 
printed letters which at tacked 
the poli tical slate of the 
Tupperware Party. Did you 
realize the potent ial effect that 
printing those biased letters 
may have had on the outcome 
of the election? Perhaps, you 
should have printed them after 
the election or proposed to the 
accused part y that they, also, 
write a leller. You could have 
t hen printed both of the letters 
simultaneously. allowing the 
VOler to see both sides of the 
issue. 

J would like to finish by 
asking the Guardian to look a-t 

it~elf objectively and compare 
it's publicatIOn to the Daily 
Cali/omiall at Berkeley. the 
UCLA Daily Bruin, ur the 

/Jar/un Daily at SJSU. all of 
which are superior college 
publicati()n~ in their formal 
and approach to journalism. 
Plea s e do make some 
necessary changes. [ will look 
for the Guardian next fall.

"I Want to Keep My Identity": 
More From the UCSD Anti-Greeks 
Editor: 

In reference to the letter 
en ti t ied, "Fratern it ies, 
Sororities Not a Loss of 
Identity". by Marc Chasman 
(Guardiall, April 21). I believe 
the anti -Greek's point of view 
should be verbalized. 

the attitude uf "how friendly 
and social can I be to be able to 
get accepted into this 
organ iza t ion?" 

As for the person who 
doesn't make it into this 
almighty group, where does 
he/ she stand in human nature 
and the social atmosphere? 
The deciding factor denounces 
cha racter, personality and 
looks; who ha<; t he right to 
judge who is a better person 
than who? If he/ she or anyone 
should want to join this group 

to become perhap" more SOCIal 
and outgoing, why should 
he/she be discouraged? 

I've discussed this many 
times with myself (in the fear 
of offending anyone) and have 
decided that UC D, SUSLT , 
UCSB, USC and all schuob 
involved with this grO\\ th of 
gregarious Greeks do not need 
those superfiCIal social sets. 
Wha t ever happened to lett tn ' 
loose. being yourself. and 
feelin ' free? 

AGDI 

In the past, I never thought 
either way about the Greek 
system, either one is "into it" 
or they're not. But lately. the 
more my roommates and 
friends get "into it", I find the 
Quote in the last letter "I want 
to keep my identity" becoming 
more clear and obvious. As 
Chasman declares. "Within a 
sorority or fraternity each 
member adds to the organiza-
tion simply be being 
himself/herself.·· I not only 
clearlv see this as being 
untrue. hut find the 
behaviorisms and conversa-
tions of my friends changing 
and becoming overl} monoto-
nous to an "outsider." 

Hedgecock Succumbing 
to Developer's Wants? 

From the beginning of my 
friend's pledging rituals. I 
have been trapped into 
listening to such conversa-
tions as "I don't think (blank) 
will make it. do you?" . and "r 
don't have enough clot hes to 
last me the rest of this week of 
parties." I sensed that first 
impressions and looks were of

returned to the Counci l 
meeting this week after an 
unsuccessful attempt to gain 
funds on April 20. The Arts 
Students submitted a revised 
line-item budget for the art

Robert Resnik Appointed Chair of 
UCSD's Reproductive Medicine 

By GLENN IYEMURA 
Sta ff Writer 

Robert Resnik , MD, 
professor of reproductive 
medicine at the UC 0 School 
of Medicine , has been 
appointed chairman of the 
medical choot's department 
of reproductive medicine. His 
appointment. effective April 1. 
1983, follows a nationwide 
search for a chairman to head 
the department. 

Samuel S.C . Yen, MD, the 
chairman of the department 
from J 972 until January I , 
J 983, resigned to devote his 
time to research, teaching, and 
patient care. Resnik ha been 
acting chairman since Yen's 

resigna tion . 
Re nik is a nationally 

recognized expert of perinatol-
ogy, the study of pre·natal 
occurences. Before his 
appointment as chairman, 
Resnik was the head of the 
department 's division of 
peri na tology. 

Resnik stated that there will 
not be any major changes in 
the way the department is 
bei ng run because Yen left the 
department in excellent shape. 
He also stated that he did not 
feel that his recent appoint-
ment as chairman would 
interfere with his teaching.

said acting Student Center

Sixteen high school teams 
from around the San Diego 
area took part in the 
competition which was in its 
second year. The 16 teams had 
to answer que tions on 
variou subjects such as 
biology, economic., music, and 
mathematics, among others. 
The winner of this year's 
event was Castle Park High 
School. Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson presented the 
awards. 

Each of the four undergrad· 
uate colleges set up informa· 
tion booths designed to orient 
prospective students with the 
campu . Many of the 
programs and services on 
campus also had information 
boot hs that were helpful to 
undergrads as well . 

The UCSD Dance Ensem· 
ble, the Jazz Ensemble, the 
Gospel Choir, and the 
Symphonic Wind Ensemble all 
pre ented programs through· 
out the day on the steps of the 
gymna ium. These groups 
were a welcome attraction for 
the many people who passed

descri bed the presen t

Two working days after thi . 
report was made public, Joe 
Watson accepted it. He did not 
allow lime for students to read 
it, discuss it and voice t hei r 
opinions on it. This act 
outralred the students and so 
they organized a group to meet 
with him. This group called 
called themselves Students for 
Control of Student Fees. 

Not on ly did thi . group not 
agree with the contents of the 
Task Force Report, but they 
also did not feel it was fair for 
Joe Watson to try to quickly 
sneak it past them. They felt 
hehad madea "mockery of the 
democratic process." 

Joe Watson said he was 
concerned. He told the groups 
that he would postpone his 
decision on accepting the Task 
Force recommendations if the

instructed him to do so. He 
knew that it would take two 
weeks for the Student Center 
Board to do this. He also knew 
that even if the CB could 
manage an emergency 
meeting, it wouldn't matter 
because the SCB chairperson 
was Watson's puppet. EI'en 
the s tudents knew that. 

Marc y Jaffe, the A 
representa tive to the St udent 
Center Board, explained that, 
"It was clear from the timing 
of Wat on's maneuvering of 
releasing the Task Force 
Report calling for change on 
Thur day and making a 
decision the following Monday 
before fina ls week t hat he 
wasn't looking for student 
input. " 

Joe Watson knew that the 
students didn't want their 
Student Center changed , but 
as vice chance llor of 
undergraduate affairs he had 
to make it seem like he was 
doing what they wanted . He 
did this by saying, "Students 
have always expressed a 
desire to have greater 
interaction with the faculty 
and staff. I think this is an 
excellent approach to their 
req uest s." 

The student s were unhappy 
with Joe Watson over the 
rationalization of "i nterac·

KSDT General Manager 
Karyn King: "He set upaTask

Task Force went against him , 
he would then emphasize that 
it's just a recommendation. He

students, but for the entire 
community. " 

Student Affirmative Action 
Committee (SAAC) Chair· 
person Taiji Miyagawa: "The 
way Watson is handling it by 
ignoring student sentiment is 
a slap in the face. Students 
should have the ultimate say 
in where their money goes, but 
he is just going ahead and 
doing what he wants. There is 
no democratic process being 
followed by this administra· 
tion." 

Third College Council 
Chairperson Shirley Johnson: 
" Wh y should the alumni , 
faculty. and staff use the 
Center when the students are 
the only ones paying for it? If 
everyone does start using it, 
the students will st i 11 be the 
only ones to s uport it 
financially. I don 't think it 
should be done that v.:ay. It\;

Joe Watson immediaLely 
found himself in conflict with 
more than a thousand 
tudents who responded to a 

que tionaire issued by the 
College Review Committee in 
the Spring of 1982. To be 
precise , 1 ,183 students 
completed the survey, and it 
hawed among other things 

that 68 percent approved the 
Student Center "as is" with 
~nly 15 percent suggesting 
Improvement. 

But everyone knew they 
could count on Joe Watson to 
succeed in his mission of 
shutt ing down a student voice. 
They knew he had experience 
at it.

JAMES RALPH PAPP 
EuropeanTravel-------------------------------------- W inner of Andy Wright's 
Spain's Best Javelina Hunting Heroic Couplet Contest 

By NINA MANZI 
A few weeks ago, I wali 

called to the phone and greeted 
with, "Hi, this is lame ." It 
took me no short while to 
realize that such a dilettante 
as james Ralph Papp should 
introduce himself with a mere 
"hi," but the evening's 
surprises had just begun . The 
purpose of his call was to 
persuade me to write a travel 
column for The Guardian . 
Although he reminded me that 
I had been to Spain, I thought 
the request a bit absurd . As I 
hung up the phone, my initial 
reaction of "t his timePapp has 
rea lly tllpped out" was 
graduall y replaced with the 
rea lization that it was the 
word "travel" that bothered 
me. The word quickly lost its 
Innocent sou nd s as I 
remembered game s how 
posters of gleaming white 
highrise hotels on the snores of 
deep blue seas in Anywhere· 
Other· Than-Here, The World. 
I'll admit righL away that I've 
never been anywhere like that. 
and I can't say that I ever hupe 
to go. I suspect that the people 
III those ~tenle hotels are the 
same the world over, and sleep 
III rooms with the 'iame plush 
carpeting and mass·produced 
seascapes, occasionalh-
\ entunng fort h to the bar for a 
hamburger and overpriced 
exot ic rink created exclusively 
for the e njoyment and 
exploitation of tourists. or to 
the beach for a bout with 
tanning oi ls and shrimp 
cocktails, all with an 

UllVarylllg, empt) predlCtabi· 
lity. 

I hope that '!-. not what james 
had in mind, because my 
travels have always tn vol ved a 
certain risk that has made 
them memorable . To be 
worthwhile, travel must 
include something more, 
taste of the unknown or the 
rediscovery of something old 
and familiar in ourselves or 
our surrounding. 

But enough of the ManZI 
philosophy of travel, and on to 
Spain. For starters, contrary 
to popular belief. the rain does 
not fall exclusively on the 
plain. In the summer of 198], 
the rain fell on the mountains. 
More specifically, it fell on the 
little Riojana town of Ezcaray. 
Ezcaray, renowned for fine 
javelina hunting and its 
proximity to Haro, the wine 
capital of Spain, is about the 
size of the UCSD campus and 
was my home for five weeks . 

I first saw Ezcaray on a 
Saturday afternoon, .... ;hen we 
moved into our rooms of a 
'ilxteenth ce ntury house 
complete wit h storks 11\ 1ll,L{ on 
t he roof. The \\ tndo\\ sand 
baleon le~ of our t hI rd ,slor) 

room~ plOllded \ lev.. ~ of the 
to\\n and the surroundin!! 
countrysIde. The absence oj 
telephone and tele\'ision wa~ 
surprising, but I was plea!-.ed 
at the prospect of living 
without these too familiar 
devices.Then the rain came. 
At about ten o'clcx'k, we were 
in the middle of frying eggs for 
supper when suddenly the 

Conversation Pieces 
Macaulay is like a book in breeches ... He has occasional 

flashes of silence, that make his conversation delightful. 
Lady Holland's Memoir, Sydney Smith 

"1 am not going to stop talking to him merely because he 
pays no attention. I like hearing myself talk. It is.one of my 
greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by 
myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don t 
understand a sinf,e word of what I am saying." 

'The Remarkable Rocket," Oscar Wilde 
"Conversation. as I it. is like juagling; up ~ the 

balls and the balloons aDd over In and

when dear Set.llian 

~~U~A~fti.~ tI~j"~.~"t~~Jb. I~,w~lere 
full of rainbow 
vanished. with nnthi~,a 

lights went out. After "everal 
mlOutes of bumping around in 
the dark and worrying alxJUt 
the eggs, !>omeone found a Bic 
lighter and supper continued. 

That night, I lay in bed 
listening to the church bells 
sound the hours. Ring is not 
the correct verb here, for 
although church bells have a 
reputation for being melodi· 
ous, those of Ezcaray were 
definitely on the tinny side. 
Later, in the early hours of the 
morning, I heard remarkable 
four · part harm o ny from 
unidentified Spaniards 
singing as they stumbled home 
from the bars. 

H was the next day that we 
settled into what wou ld be our 
routine for the summer, 
spending the afternoon sitting 
outside Novelty C<tfe and 
Casino a nd let tlng the 
actlvites of Ihe outSide world 
go on without us. The scene at 
the cafe seemed to malch the 
tranquil atmosphere . At the 
far table sat two men takmg 
tIme to playa game of chess.

nearby. watching a child

through which passed men of

version of berets, which made 
them resemble walking 
mushrooms. From somewhere 
inside fl oated unIdentifiable 
music, and spelun k1l1g waiters 
re cued ice creams from the 
depths of the cafe . At the table 
on this side of the door sat an 
elderly couple, both dressed in 
black. My adopted fami ly and I 
ruled the next table, and 
s lowl y sipped coffees and 
munched ICe creams. 

The people were on ly people, 
and the Ice creams were

the afterncxm set the mood for 
a summer that wa~ to offer me 
a different way of lookll1g at 
life, a cha nce to live through 
being instead of through mv 
hurried need to consta ntlv "do 
things ." I bit my CamyCao in 
::juiet contemplation. and sat 
back to see what sort of life the 
rainy summer held in store.

UCSD Sticks Glove in Door of 
District III Baseball Playoffs 

By JEFF SAVAGE 
Siaff Writer 

You've got to feel for 
baseball Head Coach Lyle 
Yates. He has prided himself 
on being a winner but this year 
his team has been losing about 
as often as the Cubs do. After 
going on a nine·game los tng 
s treak. lJCSD finally reached 
the bottom of their league. At 
2·14, they were t ied for dead 
last with Biola . Lyle Yates had 
been ~ay lng it all throughou t 
the season, but he found 
himself saying it again, " I 
can't ..;tand losi ng. I'm not 
used to thi s and I hate it." 

Now. all of a sudden. the 
Tritons haYe turned it around 
and are playing winning 
baseball, which has forced 
Yates to change his mood. 
Somehow. I don't think he 
minds. 

By crus hing Pt. Loma 
Tuesday afternoon 9·4, UCSD 
climbed out of the cellar and 
moved into the seventh and 
final playoff spot. at least 
temporarily. On Saturday 
however, temporary may have 
become permanent as UCSD 
split a pair of games with Pt. 
Loma, losing the first 3·2. but 
Winning the nightcap 7·5. 

Even if the Tritons lose their 
lone remaining league game 
Tuesday agamst Cal Baptist, 
Biola must win three of Its 
remaining six games (not 
unless they believe in 
miracles) to deny the Tritons a 
spot in the playoffs. 

Yates feels so confident 
about making the playoffs, he 
talks as if his team is alread y 
Ill. "We have a good chance of 
betng a definite factor III the 
playoffs. We're through WIt h

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

Staff Writer8 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. The Chicago Cubs have 
not won a pennant since 1945 and for the last 38 years have been 
ridiculed for their failure to get to the top and stay there. Loyal 
Cub fans have also been the victims of many jokes for some time. 
But never before have Cubbie loyalists been berated like they 
were after Chicago lost to the Dodgers Friday. Chicago Manager 
Lee Ilia used a certain expletive more than once while screaming 
to the media about the fans . "They say Cub fans are supposed to 
be behind you and they're ripping everything we do. If they're 
the real Chicago Cub fans, they can kiss my bleeping ass right 
downtown . Those bleepers (the fans) don't even work. Eighty-
five percent of the world is working and the other 15 percent are 
here .. . That's why they're at the game. It 's a bleeping 
playground for them. Rip those bleepers. Rip tho e country 
bleepers. My kid are bu ting their bleeping asses and people are 
booing. All those bleeping editorials about Cey. There are 143 
bleeping games left." What do you think Elia was tryin~ to say? 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Kareen Abdul Jabaar has 
posse sed the mo t unstoppable shot in the history of the NBA. 
When the 7-2 Laker center spins and relea es his famous 
kyhook , it travels downward to get to the hoop. He has certainly 

been a good commodity to the Lakers for yea rs. But Kareem 
wants two million dollars next year. Kareem is (dare we say it) 
getting old. Yes, he can till play the game, and very well at that, 
but for how long? NBA centers are getting bigger and stronger 
every year. Ralph Sampson iscomingin this year. Pat Ewingwill 
be in by next year if not before. More are on the way. The big fella 
can't last much longer against these younger fellas. Owner Jerry 
Buss will tell Kareem to take his skyhook and take a sky hike. 
WAIT A MIN UTE DEPT. The New York Jets have had some 
difficulty keeping their offense out of the spotlight for the past 
couple of yea rs, especially last season when Freeman McNeil 
was busy running over all those defenders. The fact is the Jets 
have a high powered offense second only to you know who. Do 
our eyes deceive us, then, when we read the Jets 1983 draft 
report, which says that the club look a quarterback in the first 
round, a running back in the second, a receiver in the third, and a 
tight end in the fourth? The Jet" are building on their high· 
ca liber offense, but perhaps t hey ~hould shore up the part of 
their team that needs the most help. the secondary. Oh, it's too 
late now. 
QUOTES EXTRAORDINAIRE DEPT, l r ni\'er~ity of 
Wa shington defensive back Ra y Ilonon, who wa~ drafted by the 
Cincinnati Bengals. commented on discussions he had with the 
Los Angeles Express of the [1SFL: "They said they didn't have 
enough money for me. I don't know if that means I'm too 
expensive, or they're broke."

The Tritons defeated USIU in a shortened contest (two doubles matches were not 
completed), 5-2. 

B-ball Wins Twice 
continucd from pagc 13 
over Pt. Lorna. He opened with 
a loud bang, cracking a double 
to the wall todrive homea run . 
He ended up with three hits in 
four at bats un the day. 

In the first game of 
aturday's doubleheader. 

Wolf went hitles in two plate 
appearances, but it didn't 
seem to matter as Scott 
"Scooter" Melendrez went 
two for four and scored twice 
to give the Trit ons a 2-1 lead in 
the e<lrly going. Behind Dave 
Jankowski's superb defensive 
play at third. junior pitcher 
Chris Van Schaack carried the 
one run lead into the final 
inning. What 's more, he had a 
one hitter going. 

But Van Schaack s imply ran 
out of fuel and combined with 
:\1ike Petersen to issue the 
Crusaders three walks and 
t \VO singles to a llow the two 
runs thet ga\'e Pt. Lorna the 
WIn. 

Before the umpire had a 

chance to dust off home plate. 
Eric Reynold s had given up 
three quick runs to Pt. Loma in 
the second game and the 
Tritons were cast in their 
familiar role of having to play 
ca tch up. 

In the fifth, UCSD scored 
three times to tie it up. A walk 
to Melendrez, singles by Don 
Petersen and Brian Kummer, 
and Joe Wulf'» RBI double uff 
the wall at the :360 foot sign in 
left center did t he trick, and 
the game was tied. 

With two out in the eighth, 
the Tritons began a two run 
ra lly that wasclimaxed by REf 
singles by Joe Mireles and 
Jankowski, but the Crusaders 
came right back to tie in their 
half of the inning. 

In the ninth with the score 
knotted at five and the game 
on the line, Kummer s ingled 
and up stepped Mr. Wolf. A 
clutch hitter usuallv comes 
through here. woir came 
through . He hit a 2-1 pitch ·tOO 

feet and over the right 
centerfield wall for a two-run 
homerun. Keith Yokomoto 
managed to survive the bot tom 
of the ninth to pick up the win. 

After Tuesday's league 
game with Cal Baptist at horne 
at 2:30 pm and the televised 
San Diego Slate battle, the 
Tritons travel to Azusa Pacific 
for t he first rou nd of the 
playoffs. Unless, of course.

Watson: A Man of Power 
nmtinllcd from page 12 
But who would the University 
pay for const ruction.? 

According to ex-Student 
Center Director Marco 
LiMandri, "God will not build 
it." LiMandri is correcl. The 
plan calls for a raise in student 
center fees to provide $6.5 
million for the construction of 
step 3. Many students had 
voiced their concern over 
where the money generated 
from thi ' expansion facility 
would go. 

Some people even thought 
that Step 3 would not happen 
without student consent. 
ED A Manager Mitch osna 
said, " If Watson continues as 
he has ben, informed students 
from the tudent Center and 
others will canvas this campus 
and try to educate and 
convince st udents to vote 
against the tep 3 plan." joe 
Wat son replied: "{ have 
absolutely no concern how the 
vote comes out. The plan will 
be approved." 

chancellor himself?" "Because 
the chancellor controls the 
vice chancellors," explained 
joe Wat on. Okay, then, if it 
has to bf' a vice chancellor, 
why the vc of undergraduate 
affairs instead of the vice 
chancellor of management and 
facilities? I n't this person to 
be responsible for the 
management of a facility? 
"Hey, ot her vice chancellors 
handle things not directly in 
line with their job. For 
example, Payroll must report 
to the vice chaTlcellor of 
business and finance. " Joe 
Watson felt that because there 
were mix-ups already, one 
more cou ldn' t hurt. 

joe Watson pretended to 
assume that the students 
themselves wanted to change 
their Student Center into a 
University Center. He didn't 
want to hold a student vote. 
Maybe he didn't want to find 
out what they wanted.
