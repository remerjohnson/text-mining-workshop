SURF REPORT

VOLUME 45, ISSUE 4 MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2012 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

By Daniel Song
Staff Writer

This year’s A.S. Council starts the new academic year with a $268,000 deficit that it inher-
ited from last year’s council. Vice 
President of Finance Bryan Cassella 
delivered the news at the first A.S. 
Council meeting on Oct. 3. He plans 
to use this entire year to craft a 10-year 
finance plan that he will present at the 
end of the year. Cassella hopes future 
councils will use his plan when making 
long-term financial decisions.

Cassella said he will devote two 
positions in his office to this project 
alone. He hopes a greater part of coun-
cil will join as well.

Some of the provisions that Cassella 
wants to include in the plan include a 
future income plan for development 
of businesses, a stance on whether 
the A.S. Council should work toward 
becoming a 501c3 (a tax-exempt orga-
nization) and communications with 
other cabinet members for long-term 
development of their offices.

“I, at bare minimum, hope to be 
well underway so that my successor 
may pick up where my office has left 
off,” Cassella said. “If the Council wish-

es it to be put into any sort of resolu-
tion or legislation, then when the time 
comes we will have that discussion. But 
for now, it is just an office project.”

This year’s A.S. Council has already 
taken measures to try to reduce the 
deficit and gain back the money lost in 
budget shortfalls this year.

“I know it was difficult for me to 
sit in that cabinet meeting and cut 
my budget, but I know everyone else 
in that room was going through the 
same thing,” Associate Vice President 
Diversity Affairs Elizabeth Garcia said. 
“I think it shows great character for 
this council and the VP finance for 
dealing with it instead of letting future 
councils inherit a deficit.”

So far, A.S. Council has already 
made $154,000 in cuts that reduced 
the overall deficit to this current figure 
of $268,000. The cuts mainly affect the 
AVP and executive offices.

“From here, we need to make sure 
that we’re fiscally responsible and 
accurately tracking our expenses,” A.S. 
President Meggie Le said. “The next 
step now is working with Bryan in 
order to create a multi-year plan to pay 
back the deficit. We’ll also have each 
office responsible for turning in their 
expenses each quarter.”

This will be the first 10-year 
plan that council has made. Cassella 
believes the lack of previous long-term 
plans is part of the reason the current 
council is facing budget difficulties. He 
explained that the one-year terms that 
A.S. councilmembers serve tend to 

make the members near-sighted about 
their goals and projects.

Cassella explained that last year’s 
council did not foresee the under-
enrollment that occurred last year. 
Under-enrollment gave council less 
disposable funding than projected, 
leading them to over-allocate $110,000 
in funds and overspend by an addi-
tional $70,000.

“When it comes down to it, it was 
the responsibility of the entire previ-
ous council to oversee the office of 
finance and keep them accountable,” 
VP External Affairs Olamide Noah 
said. “Every week we have to approve 
each and every funding request so it 
isn’t just the [previous] VP Finance’s 
fault. Unfortunately, there were no 
structures of accountability.”

Cassella acknowledged that while 
he cannot force future councils to fol-
low the plan, he hopes that they will at 
least use it as a base.  

“My hope is that future years will 
want to use this as a template, but it is 
hard to mandate something for some-
one who hasn’t taken up the thought of 
being in office,” Cassella said. “Certain 
things I would like to put into legisla-
tive writing, but those will be in terms 
of preventative measures for a future 
deficit rather than future changes, 
because many things change based 
on the environment as so happened 
this year.”

The California State University 
Board of Trustees announced last 
week that the 23-campus system has 
selected a new chancellor.   Timothy 
P. White, currently the chancellor at 
UC Riverside, will take over for CSU 
Chancellor Charles B. Reed, who 
announced his retirement in May.

White, originally from Argentina, 
has been chancellor at UCR since 
2008. Previously, he served as the 
President of the University of Idaho 
from 2004-08.

In a letter to UC Riverside fac-
ulty, staff and students, White said 
that he and his wife Karen had very 
much enjoyed their experience in 
Riverside.

“Your friendship, advice, and 
encouragement have allowed us to 
be a special part of this wonderful

UCSD has installed its first 
on-campus public electric vehicle 
charging stations. The two new sta-
tions were publicly unveiled at the 
Structures and Materials Engineering 
building dedication on Sept. 21.

The electric vehicle charging sta-
tions allow drivers of electric cars to 
charge their vehicles using renew-
able energy. UCSD plans to install 21 
charging stations in total. 

They will be located on the main 
campus, although three charging 
stations have already been installed 
off-campus at the Bachman Parking 

Structure at Hillcrest Medical Center. 
Three more charging stations will be 
installed at the Arbor structure at the 
UCSD Medical Center. 

“These initiatives are all a part of 
the campus’ effort to ‘green’ the UC 
San Diego fleet, ” UCSD Director of 
Sustainable Operations Dave Weil 
said. “In fact, about 52 percent of 
UC San Diego’s vehicles use some 
form of alternative fuel.”

Users of the charging stations 
will be billed through a network 
interface, and it will cost $3 for 
an 80-percent charge. The charging 
station can be reserved for a maxi-
mum of four hours, and users are 
required to have a campus permit or 

pay for visitor parking. 
Sullivan Solar Power, a residen-

tial solar energy company, installed 
the new electric vehicle charging 
stations. Funds were provided by 
the electric transportation company 
ECOtality through its EV Project, a 
funded program that deploys elec-
tric vehicles and charge infrastruc-
tures across the United States. 

Sullivan Solar Power is work-
ing with ECOtality to install these 
electric vehicle charging stations at 
sites in San Diego, Los Angeles, and 
Orange County. 

As of June 2012, over 2,000 
charging stations were present in 
California, and a total of 8,000 in 

the United States.
All University of California cam-

puses have installed electric vehicle 
charging stations within the past 
few years — with the exception of 
UC Riverside, which is currently 
undergoing a two-year project to 
install these stations and other solar 
utilities on its campus. 

In conjunction with the elec-
tric vehicle charging stations, UCSD 
plans to install solar-powered panels 
on the rooftop of the new Structures 
and Materials Engineering building 
at the Jacobs School of Engineering.

UCR family and greater Riverside 
community,” White wrote. “While we 
will deeply miss working alongside 
you to achieve our aspirations for 
this campus, our hearts will remain 
forever connected to UCR.”

UC President Mark G. Yudof said 
that while White would be missed, he 
welcomed the prospect of having a 
familiar face as his CSU counterpart.

“Chancellor White has provided 
tremendous service to the University 
of California and its Riverside campus 
for the past four years, and he is an 
excellent choice to lead the California 
State University system,” Yudof said 
in an Oct. 4 statement. “While he will 

be missed, it is no small consolation 
knowing that, with Chancellor White 
at the helm of the CSU, the University 
of California will continue to have a 
well-placed partner and ally in the 
fight to preserve public higher educa-
tion in California.”

UC Riverside joins UC Berkeley 
in joining the market for a new 
Chancellor. UC Berkeley Chancellor 
Robert J. Birgeneau announced in 
March that he would be stepping 
down so that he could return to 
teaching physics and materials sci-
ence. UC Berkeley has not yet named 
a replacement for Birgeneau.

During his tenure, White oversaw 
the establishment of UCR’s medical 
school — the sixth in the UC system. 

CSU’s announcement that White 
would be taking over at the begin-
ning of 2013 came two days after 
the Liaison Committee on Medical 
Education — an accrediting board 
for medical programs — announced 
that UC Riverside was tentatively 
approved to begin recruiting students 
for a new medical school that will 
open for the 2013-14 academic year. 
In 2011, UC Riverside had applied 
for the LCME’s go-ahead to begin 
recruiting but was denied accredi-
tation because of uncertainty sur-
rounding the new school’s financial 
footing.

CAMPUS — The UCSD Women’s 
Center named Marnie Brookolo as 
their new director last June. Brookolo 
was promoted from assistant director 
following the departure of Emelyne 
dela Pena, who retired in June after 
eight years in the position.The Center 
is currently searching for a new assis-
tant director as part of its goal to 
have a full staff on board as soon as 
possible. Brookolo hopes to take a 
fresh look at the goals of the orga-
nization and to assess their plans for 
the future.

Twitter is the encapsulation of what the Internet has become, giving any person the ability to feed their need for instant gratification in 140-word characters or less. It has become a 
great way to enhance education by publicly generating intellectual 
dialoges and making that information readily accessible. In a way, 
live tweeting at acedemic conferences can emulate the enrichment 
that TED Talks give the public, and should be allowed during 
scholarly conferences. 

The debate rages on among tweeters regarding whether people 
who attend these scholarly conferences should be able to live-tweet 
as they listen. Audience members use hashtags to create trending 
topics which make the subject matter easily searched.  Fittingly, 
the argument over tweeting during conferences uses the hashtag 
#TwitterGate. 

The dilemma here lies in the presentation of scholarly work and 
whether it should be available to the normal person, using hashtags 
to cite the conference as the source.  Kathleen Fitzpatrick, director of 
the scholarly communication of the Modern Language Association 
believes that when an academic wants his or her work to not be 
publicly disclosed, they should have the option to restrict tweeting. 

The problem with live-tweeting scholarly conferences, according 
to Adeline Koh, an assistant professor at Richard Stockton College, 

is that while a lot of scholars want their research to be noticed, they 
do not want their original ideas taken and passed off as someone 
else’s. However, there are ways to go about Tweeting that keep 
focus on the speaker, constantly crediting back to the initial seed 
of the conversation, while still welcoming dialoge. For example, 
the Showing the Arts and Humanities Matter, a symposium done 
by University College London this past September, used the 
hashtag #4hum to promote the conference. This hashtag kept the 
conversation close to the roots of the conference, and can even be 
done for each speaker, so that the ideas discussed at the sympo-
sium were correctly credited. 

Keeping the academic ideas in these conferences easily acces-
sible is important to the public. In one example Koh writes about 
when she went into a school budget meeting and no one was 
there. She argues that if she had had some form of platform that 
could help her educate other people, something easy and wide-
spread like Twitter, she could have alerted people about the meet-
ing, thus making a statement to stop the budget cuts. 

Twitter has its drawbacks, as it can lead to oversimplified 
ideas. Because a tweet can only hold 140 characters, it forces the 

A Little Birdy 
Told Me I

f there’s one place on campus I 
hate, it’s Solis 107. No, it’s not 
because of some past dispute with 

a professor over getting a B+ instead 
of an A-, or because the clock there 
sometimes lies that class is over when 
there are still 10 minutes left — it’s 
because of the chairs. I cannot bring 
myself to sit on them.

The once-yellow plush seats 
appear faintly grayish-brown and are 
rife with unidentifiable stains. From 
the perspective of an obsessive-
compulsive germaphobe, these 
seats are as bad as those on public 
transportation. Without fail, I have 
a class there every quarter — the 

psychology department seems to 
really love Solis — but I have good 
reason to resent this lecture hall. 
Unlike plastic chairs, seats made 
out of cloth are difficult to clean 
and disinfect. A friend showed me a 
New York Times article published on 
March 5, 2011 that has given me solid 
reason to avoid soft, cloth chairs for 
all eternity. Once you know, there’s no 
going back.

According to “On BART Trains, 
the Seats Are Taken (by Bacteria),” 
at least nine different bacteria strains 
— including fecal and skin-borne 
bacteria resistant to antibiotics and 
a drug-resistant bacterium called 
MRSA — were discovered on a 
randomly selected BART seat. Even 
after the seat was cleaned with an 
alcohol wipe, the chair was still found 
to foster much harmful bacteria. 
Lecture halls experience far less traffic 
than public transit, but the underlying 
issue is still the same. Solis chairs are 
made of the exact same material as 
BART seats.

I am not worried about falling 
deathly ill immediately upon contact 
with these vile yellow chairs, but I 
cannot concentrate properly knowing 
that I am sitting on an entire jungle 
of bacteria and mold. To minimize 
contact with bus seats, Sheldon 
Cooper from “The Big Bang Theory” 
even wears a separate pair of trousers 
over his regular pants while riding 
public transportation. While I would 
never go so far as to wear “bus pants,” 
I do actively avoid sitting in the 
mainstream chairs of Solis Hall.

The very back, dimly-lit part 
of this lecture hall has a few reject 
chairs (the normal desks with plastic 
chairs attached) that people typically 
only sit in as a last resort. The peace 
of mind I get from sitting in a hard 
plastic chair over a plush one is worth 
scrawling my notes in the dark. In 
the same BART seat study, a random 
acrylic plastic Muni seat was tested 
and found to be far more sanitary 
— with only two benign bacteria 
colonies uncovered and no detectable 
bacteria after it was cleaned with 
an alcohol wipe. Yes, we do live in 
a world of bacteria — we’re alive 
because of these pests and there is no 
avoiding contact with them. And of 
course, I’m neurotic and no one else 
actually puts that much thought into 
the chairs they sit in. But despite this, 
I will still hold out hope that Solis 107 
will get chair replacements before I

The Healthy, Hunger-Free 
Kids Act of 2010 — the signature 
piece of Michelle Obama’s quest to 
combat childhood obesity — has 
received a myriad of complaints 
because of the lack of quantity in 
school lunches. 

While the First Lady’s effort to 
fight childhood obesity is laudable 
and a step in the right direction, it 
nonetheless negates the students’ 
need to feed their own appetite. 
The legislation’s negative effects 
must be addressed, especially when 
taking into account the students 
who require additional calories, 
such as student athletes.

For starters, the legislation 
requires high school lunches to 
have no more than 850 calories, 
with an emphasis on fruits and 
vegetable. The policy also does not 
take into measure children who 
require different caloric intakes, 
since the legislation inaccurately 
assumes universality: boys and girls 
are on the same meals, regardless of 
height, size and weight.

According to the National 
Federation of State High School 
Associations (NFHS), approximate-
ly 55 percent of students participate 
in sports or other calorie-burning 
activities such as dance and 
ROTC.  The Sept. 24 Daily Mail 
article “We’re Hungry!” reports 
that student athletes, can burn up 
to 5,000 calories a day — and with 
the new regulation will only be able 
to consume 20 percent of what they 
burn. 

Providing student athletes with 
larger portions would help them 
on the field, and in the classroom. 
It is understandable that the First 
Lady has taken measures to combat 
childhood obesity, but our student 
athletes — who roughly account 
for half of high school students — 
require additional nutrition. While 
on the quest to eliminate childhood 
obesity, one must not forget that all 
students are not built the same.

Legislation Ignores Fact That Students Differ in Caloric Needs New Lunch Program Will Help Curb Childhood Obesity
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids 

Act (HHFK) passed in December 
2010 improves the nutritional 
quality of school lunches by 
including more fruits, vegetables, 
whole grains and limiting calories. 
This lunch program will help curb 
the growth of childhood obesity 
and instill healthy eating habits in 
our youth.

In our nation, one in three chil-
dren — or 24 million — are obese 
or overweight, which is nearly tri-
ple the rate as of 1963,  according 
to the Centers of Disease Control 
and Prevention. 

According to the American 
Diabetes Association, diabetes is 
also prevalent among children, 
with a diagnosis rate of 1 in 400. 
Clearly, U.S. children are not as 
healthy as they could be, and this 
bill will help guide children toward 
healthier lifestyles.

Critics claim that the limits 
placed on school lunches of 850 
calories for high school students, 
700 calories for middle school 

students and 650 calories for 
elementary students is a draconian 
infringement of civil rights and 
that these smaller meals do not 
adequately fill students up. 

To be clear to these critics, this 
bill only affects lunches provided 
by the National School Lunch 
Program, i.e. subsidized school 
lunches for low-income families. 

Parents can opt to pack brown 
bag lunches for their kids to 
complement their school lunches if 
they feel that the portions are too 
small. 

As for the caloric limits, ABC 
News reports that those do not 
apply to servings of fruits and veg-
etables; students can always return 
for second servings. 

HHFK is a bill that needed 
to be passed. This bill addresses 
obesity in this country by working 
with the people that can benefit the 
most, the kids.

Solve FoR X By Philip Jia
the healthy, hunger-Free KiDs act,

Dear editor,
Regarding the “SDPD fiasco 

in Pacific Beach”: While I do not 
condone the white-glove treatment 
in regard to the San Diego Police 
Department captain’s son, the 
officers involved could have at 
least put this VIP on a private jet 
on way to The George V where he 
could have dined on catering from 
Fauchon. What a joke. Just don’t 
lecture the Arab World about our 
obsession with justice and equality. 
Where are the law and order folks 
when we really need them? Oh my, 
c’mon. Is this hypocrisy or what? 
If charity truly begins at home, we 
ought to correct this injustice and 
fast. 

My heartfelt condolences to all 
the good and decent military men 
and women who frequent these 
Pacific Beach watering holes and 
have been locked up for far less than 
the charges not brought forward 
against this pathetic privileged 
young man.

Troops Should Only 
Fight for Good Reason

 

Dear editor,
I am writing to express my anger 

and frustration about the brave U.S. 
troops who continue to be forced 
into harm’s way for absolutely no 
good reason!

I am 53 years old and I clearly 
remember the very many protests 
during the Vietnam War. There 
were literally millions of people 

who had grown to detest this 
slaughter of humans on both sides 
of this war.  I am not angry at the 
U.S. troops that fought in this war, 
but then, as now, I am angry and 
frustrated by the ignorance that 
pervades Washington, D.C. to con-
tinue, yet again, to put U.S. troops 
in harm’s way for absolutely noth-
ing!

The Vietnam War was fought 
to keep South Vietnam free from 
communism.  Here, again, U.S. 
troops were called upon to shoul-
der the overwhelming danger of 
doing the fighting and dying.  My 
memory is that the Vietnam troops 
may as well have not even exist-
ed!  After years and years of bloody 
loss, the communists took South 
Vietnam anyway.  Again, what good 
was accomplished by so much loss 
by U.S. troops and their families?

Now, we have the asinine quag-
mire of Iraq and Afghanistan.  The 
government of Afghanistan 
— if you can call it that — has 
even asked the United States to 
leave! Why in the name of human-
ity can’t our government see how 
insulting these ungrateful warring 
people are to U.S. troops and our 
country?  The “friendlys” killing 
U.S. troops answer this question!

tweeter to summarize the arguments 
in essentially two-sentences. This 
effectively simplifies the argument 
into a form that is several notches 
below that of scholarly conferences 
between academics. Live-tweeters 
at  Console-ing Passions, a confer-
ence on media and feminism at 
Suffolk University, were so busy 
Tweeting that they ended up simpli-
fying the material, and even wrongly 
presented the information. Such as 
speaker Tara McPherson’s ideas were 
misinterpreted via Twitter, which 

depicted that she thought studying 
media and television narratives are a 
waste of time. In reality, she was just 
emphasizing the importance of also 
examining the codes, systems and 
networks of media “texts.” This is 
misleading to people who are trying 
to follow the presentations virtually.

If used properly, there are ways 
that Twitter can further education 
through live-tweeting. Christine 
Becker, an associate professor in 
the Department of Theatre, Film 
and Television at the University of 
Notre Dame, uses Twitter as a tool 
to spark conversations amongst TV 

critics and her students. Because 
most of the material she teaches 
revolves around events happening 
in the present, Twitter helps her stay 
updated with her students, and other 
professors around the world. 

Live-tweeting conferences 
encourages conversations amongst 
academics, allowing graduate stu-
dents and teachers to engage in 
discussions during and after, and 
allow people who can’t attend to par-
ticipate virtually. Twitter is a place 
for information to gather and pros-

Crime and Punishment
New Report Reveals Odd Instances and Worrying Trends

Arpineh Bagramian woke up one morning know-ing that something had 
gone very wrong with her body. Her 
heart drummed at nearly twice its 
normal rate. She tried to breathe, but 
found her lungs suddenly incapable 
of extracting oxygen from the air. 
Her fingers went numb, and after a 
while, so did her arms. It was Aug. 
23, the morning of the first and only 
midterm for her endocrinology class. 
The test was worth 40 percent of her 
grade, but Arpineh knew there was 
no way she’d be able to take it. She 

called her doctor and told him what 
was wrong.

“I wasn’t too worried about 
missing the midterm at that point, 
because I’d always thought there was 
some university-wide policy protect-
ing me. That a professor had to listen 
to a doctor when he said I was inca-
pable of taking a test,” she said.

When she was taking metabol-
ic biochemistry the previous year, 
Bagramian had to miss a midterm 
due to a death in the family.  

“[The professor] let me take a 
makeup exam, no questions asked,” 

she said.
At the hospital, Arpineh found 

out that she had suffered a panic 
attack. She obtained a nurse’s note 
explaining that even though the con-
dition was not life-threatening, it cer-
tainly would have prevented her from 
functioning in any stressful situation, 
such as a midterm. In fact, the let-
ter explained, exposure to stressful 
situations could lead to more severe 
attacks. She felt calmed by the note, 
thinking the university’s academic 
regulations would guarantee her a 
second chance to demonstrate what 

she had learned.
She was wrong.
The densely worded Regulations 

and Policies Manual, penned by the 
UCSD Academic Senate in 1981,  
governs academic policy on every-
thing from dropping classes to grade 
appeals. It is a 6,500 word document 
that is often vague and somewhat dif-
ficult to understand. 

“No student may be excused from 
final examinations,” the Manual states 
at one point. But just a few paragraphs 
down, it adds that a request to excuse 
a student from a final exam must be 

filed by the end of Week Two.
When it comes to missed mid-

terms, the manual places the burden 
of judgment and administration on 
the professor.

“An instructor may administer an 
examination at an alternative time if 
a valid reason is given by the student 
for not taking the regularly scheduled 
examination. Valid reasons include 
serious illness and family disasters,” 
the regulations state. “Illness” is used 
a total of six times in the Academic

Staff Writer 

Due to the rapid response time to any suspicious on-campus activity by 
the Resident Security Officers, we’ve 
come to think of UCSD as the last 
place for any kind of serious crime. 
It is, after all, situated in the affluent 
community of La Jolla, where the only 
complaints seem to be of noise.

Don’t be fooled — on-campus 
crime created a demand for a fair 
share of yellow caution tape. In 2011 
alone, on-campus criminal reports 
totalled six accounts of forcible sexual 
offense, six accounts of aggravated 
assault, 29 accounts of burglary, 18 
motor vehicle thefts and 106 liquor 
law arrests. Campus police officers 
appear to be swarmed with work.

“I can say that we’re very busy right 
now,” said a UC Police Department 
officer, who asked to remain anony-
mous. “As the economy gets worse, we 
might expect more crime.” 

As indicated by the most recent 
and past UC San Diego Annual 
Security Reports, constant theft is the 

most common problem. And it makes 
sense; UCSD is a concentrated hub 
of unmonitored laptops and bikes — 
prime real estate for any grand theft 
scheme.

“People tend to leave their stuff 
out because it’s a nice area,” the officer 
said. “There’s more crime in La Jolla 
than people generally think because 
a lot is not made readily known to 
the public.”

According to a Dec. 20, 2010 
Crime Alert Bulletin, three accounts 
of grand theft, all of which took 
place at either Geisel Library or Price 
Center, were investigated by the 
UCSD Police Department. The sus-
pect targeted unattended backpacks 
and an unattended laptop. 

Even known criminals have fre-
quented the campus. In a Dec. 14, 
2011 Wanted Person Bulletin, it was 
brought to the public’s attention that 
“Timothy Jon Hasper is a known thief 
that frequents the UCSD campus to 
steal bicycles.”

But it’s not just petty theft that’s 
been making the crime briefs of the 
news page. Over the past couple of 
years, students have been receiving 

almost a consistent stream of emails 
from UCSD administration about 
more violent crimes — eerily, many 
of them fall on or around finals week. 

 Subject lines of emails from the 
UCSD Police Department have read: 
“Attempted Kidnapping on 5/20 @ 
8:00pm,” “Black’s Beach Sexual 
Assault,” or “Car Fire Homicide 
Update.”

All of the headlines spoke of sto-
ries that could send collective chills 
down the spines of the student popu-
lation.

The attempted kidnapping 
occurred at 8 p.m. on May 20, 2011, 
just west of Geisel. A male report-
edly placed a paper bag over a female 
victim’s head and attempted to lug 
her off the pathway. The victim was 
able to break free and flee from the 
scene. A similar incident occurred on 
1 Miramar Street nearly 10 months 
later on March 14, 2012, and likewise, 
the victim managed to escape. On 
Dec. 6, 2011, a sexual assault occurred 
midway between Black’s Beach and 
Gliderport, and according to the vic-

RUSSELL MALIPHANT COMPANY: AFTERLIGHT 
- MANDEVILLE AUDITORIUM
Russell Maliphant's work is characterized by his 
unique approach to flow and energy as well as an 
ongoing exploration between movement, light, and 
music. His long and close collaboration with 
pioneering lighting designer Michael Hulls creates 
spellbinding images that give 'visual shape to the 
transforming power of the dancing body and the 
dancing imagination' (The Guardian, UK). With 
Afterlight, Maliphant creates a gorgeously intimate 
reflection of the dark side of one of ballet's greatest 
superstars, Vaslav Nijinsky. Confined during his later 
years for schizophrenia, Nijinsky's drawings during 
that time are Maliphant's inspiration for his deeply 
touching choreography. Post-performance 
conversation with the artists. UCSD students: $11, 
Others: $24-$48

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 8,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Senate regulations. “Serious illness” 
is used a total of three times. But the 
manual never defines what a serious 
illness actually constitutes. It fails to 
clarify whether make-up examina-
tions are a professor’s obligation, or 
choice, to administer. And worst of 
all, it suggests but never defines what 
a “valid” reason is. These ambigui-
ties open the way for professors to 
act unfairly, even if they don’t mean 
to. For instance, it’s easy for a non-
psychiatrist to write off a panic attack 
as a minor inconvenience, or even 
worse, a ploy.

“When I went to [my endocri-
nology] professor with the medical 
papers, he said it wasn’t a valid excuse 
to miss the midterm. He told me I 
could’ve come to the test anyway, that 
he wasn’t accepting them, and that 
he recommended I drop the course. 
When I came back with a second 
note from the RN [the head nurse], 
it explained that even though [panic 
attacks] aren’t life threatening, I had a 
valid reason to miss the test.”

The current regulations don’t even 
require a professor to have a con-
sistent makeup policy. One of the 
professor’s TAs told Bagramian that 
a doctor’s note was all she needed: 
the professor had dropped mid-

terms for students with a note in 
previous years. A former student told 
Bagramian that he wrote make-ups 
for every midterm.

“He kept asking me for personal 
information, the nature of the panic 
attacks” Bagramian said. “I was will-
ing to tell him everything, but I did 
think, ‘Don’t I have a right to medical 

confidentiality?’ My physician later 
told me he had no right to ask me 
those things. He made his judgment 
based on the nature of the complaint, 
which he clearly had a set of precon-
ceived ideas about.”

 But in an email to Bagramian, the 
professor took a different approach 
altogether. He stated that the best 
she could hope for was a grade of 
Incomplete, if she brought a note.

“You may be eligible for a grade of 
‘I’ and finish the missing exam at the 
end of next quarter,” he wrote.

Others expressed their distaste 
for the inconsistencies the current 
academic policies allow. Gabrielle 
Weinhausen, the Associate Dean 
for Education in the Division of 
Biological Sciences, stated in an 
email to Bagramian that although 
she would talk to professor, there was 
nothing she could do to make him 
change her grade.

“I am as disappointed as you are,” 
she wrote. “The instructor has full 
authority over grades.”

After Weinhausen, Bagramian 
and a number of other administra-
tors had talked to professor, he agreed 
to let her take the final. Bagramian 
said he refused to give her details 
about how he would grade her, saying 
only that he would pass her if she did 
exceptionally well.

“I got about the average. It was a 
cumulative final, covering everything 
the midterm had, and yet he gave me 
a C- in the class. It was so arbitrary,” 
she said. “Even if I’d gotten an F—a 
50 percent—on the midterm, I would 
have ended up with a solid B in the 
class, because the way things were 
curved. To give me a zero on the mid-
term and just add 10 percent to my 
grade afterwards was a completely 

random and unfair way to deal with 
things.”

Bagramian said that although a 
C- is a passing grade, it is inadequate 
for most pharmacy school programs, 
which she intends to apply to this 
year. She said she was disturbed by 
the unfairness of the process, the lack 
of oversight and regulation and the 

inability of administrators to step in.
“That was my last class ever as 

an undergrad. I was getting ready to 
move back to LA. I was applying for 
jobs, and I had a solid GPA,” she said. 
“It ruined my last quarter, my final 
memories of San Diego.”

tim, alcohol was involved. 
Though reports of kidnappings 

and assaults are always unsettling, 
perhaps the most alarming case con-
cerns the first recorded murder on 
campus in UCSD’s recent history — 
on Oct. 29, 2010 at 9:20 p.m., the 
body of 38-year-old Carlsbad resident 

Lorena Gonzalez was found in a car 
consumed by flames in Lot 701 off 
Voigt Drive. An autopsy ruled the case 
to be a homicide, and police investiga-
tions led to the victim’s estranged hus-
band, Julio Angel Garcia-Puente who 
was eventually located by Mexican 
authorities in the Otay neighborhood 
of Tijuana. Garcia-Puente surren-
dered to U.S. authorities at the San 

Ysidro Port of Entry and was arrested 
and incarcerated.

Of course, murder and burning 
vehicles aren’t a common occurrence, 
but they’re still a reason for caution 
— it’s a reminder that despite our 
overwhelming population of party-
busting RSOs, our well-behaved cam-
pus isn’t immune to a crime scene that 
could be from an episode of “CSI”. 

And with the expansion of the student 
body, coupled by the downturn in our 
economy, there seems to be more to 
worry about these days.

“Protect your valuables, and be 
aware,” the officer said.

The police urge students to take 
simple precautions:. Never hesitate 
to use campus emergency telephones 
to report suspicious activity to UCSD 

police, and take advantage of the 
UCSD Safety Escort Program (the 
escorts are trained in small talk). And 
be extra careful during finals week 
— a midnight walk to Goody’s for a 
study break should be never be taken 
alone.

the other hand, plays the soccer 
mom, urging our players to just try 
really hard and we’ll be proud of 
them no matter what. Our fight song 
needs to demand that our teams 
crush the enemy, tapping into the 

primitive and brutal side of us that 
makes spectators lose control; simply 
urging our players to fight, but not 
necessarily win, does nothing for 
mob brutality.

If we somehow managed a com-
plete overhaul of our fight song — 

through a school-wide songwrit-
ing contest facilitated by YouTube 
or Facebook, perhaps — we could 
advance a step towards the kind of 
spectator enthusiasm that makes 
attending games a great way to spend 
a tipsy Friday night.

majority of the Triton kills in the set. 
The two teams battled through three 
tie scores, with UCSD eventually fall-
ing 25–27.

“We didn’t play our best match I 
think,” Luyties said. “We had a few 
players that were off against [San 
Francisco], yet we were still close in 
games one and three. We still aren’t 

as consistent as we want to be right 
now. ”

The second and third sets, UCSD 
had places where they took advan-
tage of SFSU’s errors and rally to 
take brief leads, but fell with scores 
of 18–25 and 22–25, respectively.

This Wednesday, Oct. 10, UCSD 
travels to San Bernardino to take on 
the 7–1 Coyotes. 

“I hope we learn from this that 

each match we play for the rest 
of the year is going to be a tough 
battle,” Luyties said.

In a constant struggle for first 
place in the CCAA, the Tritons will 
look for a win against CSU San 
Bernardino to remain near the top 
of the table.

third is a good indicator of the 
strength of this team.”

For the women, Chia Chang had 
a very strong individual perfor-
mance, finishing first for the Tritons 
and placing seventh overall for her 
10th consecutive race.

Freshman Carolina Guzman 
placed next for the Tritons at 17th 
with a time of 23:10.3. 

Sophomore Michelle LeRoux 
has continued to finish high for 
the Tritons, crossing the finish line 
22nd in 23:29.2.

The California Collegiate 
Athletic Association’s champion-
ships will be hosted by UCSD on 
Saturday, Oct. 20.

“CCAA competition is stronger 
this year, than any other since I’ve 
been here,” Garcia said. “It will be 
a really strong conference this year, 
and I’m glad that we get a chance to 

prepare for ourselves for the confer-
ence championships.”

The men will host Cal Poly 
Pomona, CSU East Bay, CSU 
Monterey Bay, CSU Stanislaus, 
Chico State, Humboldt State and 
San Francisco State. 

The women will host all the 
aforementioned schools, as well 

as CSU Los Angeles, CSU San 
Bernardino and Sonoma State for 
their 6k championship race.

The men’s 8k will begin at 9 a.m., 
followed by the women’s 6k race at 
10 a.m.

The UCSD Men’s Golf team will start competition in Chico today, Oct. 8, at the 
Wildcat Invitational.

Even before reaching the course 
for their first meet of the season, 
UCSD Assistant Coach Keith 
Okasaki says the Tritons look dan-
gerous in the 2012 season.

“I think this is the best team 
that we’ve been able to put together 
since [2007] at least. Or maybe even 
since we’ve entered Division II,” 
Okasaki said.

Last season, a young Triton 
squad without any upperclassmen 
made the program’s first appearance 
at the national level in five seasons. 
All five players appearing in the 

2011 Regional Final are back on the 
roster for UCSD.

According to Okasaki, sopho-
more Jay Lim will play in the No. 
1 spot, followed by junior Lewis 
Simon, sophomore Jacob Smith, 
freshman Clayton Yamaguchi and 
sophomore Marc Herman.

“We should do well at Chico,” 
Okasaki said. “There’s going to 
be a lot of good competition, but 
we’ve looked good during prac-
tice. And our freshman this year, 
[Yamaguchi] has played particularly 
well recently.”

The Tritons are scheduled 
to tee off today at the Corning 
Golf Course. Play will extend into 
tomorrow.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 8,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Last week, I attended the women’s 
volleyball game with several mem-
bers of the track team. We took up 
a pretty significant section of the 
stadium, determined to drown out 
the cheers of our rivals, Chico State. 
Hooting, hollering and being gener-
ally obnoxious, we died down when 
the pep band started the UCSD fight 
song. Quietly, we waited for the end 
of the song so we could do the fight 
chant. And waited. And waited.

 Finally, the last blare of the tuba 
fading, we managed a semi-enthusi-
astic “UCSD! Fight, fight, fight!” It 
became a little awkward — many did 
not even attempt the chant because 
they got bored of the song before 
it was our turn to participate, and 
several of us started the chant at 
different times, with the last utter-
ance half-hearted and uncomfortable 
as we glanced around at our silent 
peers.

This did not do much for the ener-
gy of the spectators. Unfortunately, 
this lack of enthusiasm is pervasive 
throughout a lot of UCSD’s sports 
events. Furthermore, weak spectator 
involvement at these events impacts 
the enjoyment of these same specta-
tors, which could explain, in part, the 
low attendance at our matches. 

We need an overhaul in how 
sports events are viewed and 
approached, and a new fight song 
could be a significant part of this 
renovation. Our pep band is fantas-
tic; it’s not their fault that our fight 
song is weak — but it couldn’t hurt to 
add some of the pizazz that’s typical 
of great fight songs.

Take the Chicago Bears. The 
Bears have possibly the greatest fight 
song of all time. I may be a bit 
biased, considering that half my fam-
ily hails from Chicago and, during 
Super Bowl XLI, no one was allowed 
to enter our house without belting an 
appropriately thunderous rendition 
of “Bear Down, Chicago Bears.” It is 
hard to deny that the tune really gets 
the crowd going.

“Bear Down,” with its easily rec-
ognizable lyrics and simple melody, 
allows almost anyone to master and 
sing it at the stadium, in front of the 
radio or huddled around the TV. The 
tune is unpresumptuous and unso-
phisticated, granting accessibility to 
even the most salt-of-the-earth fans.

UCSD’s fight song doesn’t give 
spectators a chance to sing. Besides 
the four-word chant at the end, all 
spectators do is sit and wait for the 
band to finish up their somewhat 
unexciting, albeit well-played, sec-
tion of the song. By making specta-
tors wait so long to participate, the 
energy droops and it’s difficult to pep 
back up.

“Bear Down” conveys a rambunc-
tious and intimidating sureness of 
victory. Boldly singing that the team 
will “make every play clear the way 
to victory,” fans revel in their team’s 
infallibility. UCSD’s fight song, on

Triton 
Fight Song 
Needs an
Overhaul

The Tritons ended their six-game winning streak at San Francisco 
State, after beating the nationally-
ranked Sonoma State last Friday, 
Oct. 5.

UCSD defeated No. 22 Sonoma in 
five sets on the road last Friday.

Freshmen Danielle Dahle and 
Sophie Rowe led the Tritons in the 
close game with 39 kills collective-
ly. Dahle — who is fourth overall 
in the CCAA in kills per set with 
3.68 — also had two blocking assists 
to Rowe’s three. Rowe also led the 
Tritons with 25 digs.

Sophomore Sara McCutchan had 
arguably the best individual perfor-
mance for UCSD, with balanced and 
dominant play on both the offense 
and defense. 

McCutchan has played at a con-
sistently high level with 13 kills, nine 
digs, and eight blocking assists per 
game. She has averaged the fifth 
most blocks per set in the CCAA 
with 1.03.

Sophomore Amber Hawthorne 
had 54 assists without an error, nine 
kills and 13 digs.

Sonoma took the first game from 
UCSD with eight tie scores and five 
lead changes, with a final score of 
25–21. 

The match tightened in the sec-
ond game, with 21 tie scores and 10 
lead changes. UCSD out hit Sonoma 
20–18 and had two less errors to help 
the team earn the 30–28 set win. 

Into the third game, UCSD began 
strong but Sonoma overcame the 
Tritons for the final time of the night 
25–22. In the fourth and fifth sets, 
UCSD simply outplayed Sonoma 
across the board.

With the victory, the Tritons 
improved to 6–1 in CCAA as they 
headed to San Francisco State to 
take on the unranked Gators, who 
just conceded a loss to CSU San 
Bernardino.

Last Saturday, Oct. 6 in San 
Francisco, UCSD suffered a wake-
up call, falling to the Gators in three 
sets.

The Tritons were outhit by more 
than five kills in all three sets.

 “We came out flat tonight against 
a good team,” UCSD Head Coach 
Ricci Luyties said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “San Francisco 
was ready to play and kept its energy 
throughout the entire match.”

Dahle had 15 kills and nine digs, 
and Rowe tallied eight kills with five 
errors and 17 digs.

But without Lauren Demos, who 
has been out for the past two games 
with a sprained ankle, there was a 
glaring hole on the Tritons’ side of 
the net.

“[Demos] brings a lot to the 
team,” Luyties said. “Personality-wise 
and in encouraging her teammates, 
it’s a hard thing to lose.”

McCutchan, too, wasn’t herself 
with only three kills on four errors. 
However, McCutchan still led UCSD 
with three blocks. 

In the first set, San Francisco 
took the first three points, while 
UCSD stayed stagnant until halfway 
through the set. But it was too little, 
too late. 

Rowe and Dahle tallied the 

SFSU Snaps UCSD Win Streak 
Tritons Split Weekend Games

Last Saturday, Oct. 6, UCSD hosted the 20th Annual Triton Invitational, where the Triton 
women took third and the Triton 
men finished first for the second 
consecutive year.

Serving as a warm-up for the 
conference championships, the 
Triton men had four runners fin-
ish in the top 10. At the front of 
the pack was UCSD sophomore 
Tanner Collins, who won the men’s 
8k race with a time of 26:15 to 
lead the Tritons to their first place 
finish. To put that time in perspec-
tive, on the CCAA conference level, 
Collins would have placed 10th at 
last year’s CCAA Championships. 
Furthermore, Collins would have 
finished 17 seconds faster than 
UCSD’s top finisher in 2011, red-
shirt Matt Lenehan, at last year’s 
conference meet.

Collins, a sophomore who has 
spent last year largely under the 
radar, finished four spots in front of 
junior captain Kellen Levy, UCSD’s 
strongest runner leading up to last 
weekend’s meet.

“Tanner has put an amazing 
amount of work in,” UCSD Head 

Coach Nate Garcia said. “He had 
a good summer, he’s been running 
really well in the past few weeks and 
has handled his business well.” 

Collins took the lead from the 
very beginning in his best showing 
ever at UCSD. 

In an interview with the UCSD 
Athletics Department, UCSD Head 
Coach Nate Garcia said the Tritons 
ran consistent throughout.

“The guys...controlled the race 
from the beginning...and in a field 
of this size it’s a really good indica-
tor of where their confidence and 
ability levels are,” Garcia said.

For the Triton Men, two fresh-
men, Tareq Alwafai and Scott Acton, 
continue to push the pace for the 
younger generation. Acton finished 
in eighth with a time of 26:36.9 
while Alwafai took sixth with 
26:35.3. The Tritons have been con-
sistently finishing at the top of the 
underclassmen in each race they’ve 
been in, and steadily improving as 
the days pass.

“I felt like we had a good day,” 
Garcia said. “There were some 
strong individual efforts, but I don’t 
think the whole team hit on all cyl-
inders. I think we missed by a little 
bit, but the fact that we still finished
