Prof Says Nukes· 'Industry Needs Competence 
By John Klock 

Senior Staff Writer 
The entire nuclear industry 

has "a considerable moral 
obligation to be more 
competent ," John Howe , 
adjunct professor of nuclear 
engineering, said Monday in 
response to the sequence of 
errors which caused last 
week's crisis at Pennsylvania 's 
Three Mile Island nuclear 
reactor. 

Earlier in the day, lfowe 
described the sequence to a 
noon crowd of 55 and answered 
technical questions when he 
could. 

Howe, who retired four yea rs 
a go from General Atomic, 

made clear from the outset that 
his sources of information were 
generally the same as the 
general public ' s~ but he is able 
to call the company ' s 
Wa hington office where 
friends are keeping touch from 
a closer perspective . 

Still , he was able to clarify 
the sequence of accidents that 
created the crisis , and with 
diagrams from reactors built 
by a different company, to 
illustrate in a general way what 
happened. 

The picture Howe brought 
forth wa that of a system 
designed to accommodate all 
sorts of unlikely problems 
(some of which ac tually 

occurred) , but sabotaged by 
human shortcoming on several 
level . 

" I think the engineering is at 
a higher level than other parts 
of the industry," Howe said 
after his talk. He included 
construction , manufacturing 
and utilities in the " obligation' 
to be more competent. " 

There were many simple 
mechanical failures , including 
the original problem, a double 
failure of " feedwater pumps" 
to keep water flowing through 
the steam generator which 
drains the heat from reactor 
cooling water. 

A serious error by the 
opera tors in charge of the plant 

was the hutdown of the 
Emergency Core Cooling 
System. 

. 'Operators should be trained 
and paid at least to the level of 
airline pilots, and they are 
not," Howe said . 

And the now famous 
hydrogen bubble which 
stymied and worried officials 
for days was not at all foreseen 
in extensive analysis of 
possible accidents which has 
been done over the years. 

. 'Some people have said there 
was too much consideration of 
unlikely possibilities to the 
detriment of looking into small 
accidents , " Howe said. 

Still , the accident was within 

the range of probabilities 
calculated (or a release of 
radioactivity of this severity by 
the officially commissioned 
Rasmussen report, given the 
400 reactor-years the U.S. has 
accumulated, according to 
Howe. 

The following account of tbe 
accident is compiled from 
Howe's account and the press: 

About 4 am last Wednesday, 
the Ceedwater pumps both went 
out. Auxiliaries failed to come 
on as . expected . Tbree

Med Library to 
Cramp Parking 
New Structure Might Solve 
Effects of Construction - In '81 

By John HondrOi 
. Assoclale News Edkor 

The already strained parking 
situation at University Hospital 
will be further hampered by the 
construction of a medical 
library, according to Larry 
Barrett, director ' of UCSD 
Auxiliary Services. 

Robert Umstead, supervisor 
of University Hospital Parking 
Services, said that construction 
of the medical library, to be 
situated on what is presently 
the out-patient parking lot, will 
begin in July. Umstead added 
that a cancer research center, 
now in its planning stages, will 
be built next to the library, 
"taking up the rest of the 
parking lot." 

The proposed library has 
been a part of the campus 
improveme.nt program for six 
years, said Vice Chancellor of 
Facilities Management Don 
Sites, adding that an en-
vironmental impact report for 
the site has been prepared. 

Sites said he realizes that 
"the parking space (at 
University Hospital) will be 
reduced .. . but the need for a 
library is greater than the need 
for parking." 

According to Barrett, there is 

presently not enopab parkil1l 
space at the medlcal facility to 
accommodate staff and faculty 
members. "There are 1208 to 
1500 people who can't find 
parking," he remarked. 

Parking space for the 
patients will have to be 
provided in the faculty-staff 
parking structure - "this will 
worsen the si tuation," 
explained BarreU. In addition, 
an "escort service" for the 
patients will be needed from the 
hospital to the parking 
structure, he said. 

According to Sites, a $5 
million parking structure has 
been proposed for the medical 
facility, the cost of which will 
come from student, faculty and 
staff parking fees. 

Said Sites, "We are currently 
negotiating over the land for 
the parking structure .. .if we 
don't get the land, I don't know 
what we will do." 

Barrett said the planned 
structure will not solve the 
immediate parking problem 
caused by the library, as "it 
won't open until 1981." 

Barrett does not foresee a 
parking fee increase at UCSD 
until 198!. 

Tebello Motapanyane of the 
African National Congress, 
which directs its efforts at the 
Republic of South Africa, and 
Andrew Chikuse of the 
Zimbabwe African People's 
Union told a noon crowd of 
about 50 on the gym steps 
that multi-national corpor-
ations, based mainly in the 
United States, were "proppil1l 
up" leparation ,of the races in 
southern Africa. 

Revelle Provost Choice Delayed 
Sites 'said the present 

medical library at University 
Hospital is "too small" and that 
the medical community as well 
as the University will benefit 
from the new facility. 

The selection of a 1{evelle 
College Provl'st has been 
delayed, as Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul 
Saltman left yesterday for 
Philadelphia without making 
his expected final decision on a 
Provost. 

"We would appreciate that Sallman, who is responsible 
the multinational corporation for choosil1l a Provost from

Motapanyane said, . 'our people had ori&inally hoped to make a

The - additional delay. said 

Brown, is due to Sallman's 
"wanting to make a good 
decision" and should not "go 
any longer than Thursday." 
Brown called the delay 
"circumstantial" and said no 
new circumstances have artsen 
to prevent an expedient 
decision. 

Saltman will return to 
campus late this afternoon and 
should select a Provost 
sometime tomorrow, ac-
cording to Brown. 

.. '- .. 

The final candidates for the 
position, which include Stanley 
Chodorow, UCSD's History 
Dept., Chia-Wei Woo, chair-
person of Physics at North-
western and Karl Lamb, acting 
provost of Cowell College at UC 
Santa Cruz, were recom-
mended to Saltman by the 
Revelle Provost Search 
C-ommittee. 

The . selected provost for 
Revelle will fill a post which has 
been vacant since June Tapp 
left at the end of last school 
year . 

Concerning the proposed 
cancer facility, Sites said the 
University sent in an 
application for federal fundi 111 
of the center. "We were not 
successful a year ago ... so we 
applied (to receive federal 
funding) again this year. We 
are supposed to find out if we 
get the fundil1l by this July," 
explained Site •. 

If the University receives the 
fund, construction of the cancer

Keep Quarters 
In 1966, as part of a grand experiment to make the 

UnJvenity of California a year round institution, 
systemwide administration changed the academic 
structure from semesters to quarters. 

The purpose of the change was to allow students to go to 
school three quarters Ii year. Students would, theoretically, 
take different quarters away from school every year. 

Obviously, that reason for the change has proved invalid. 
LIlt summer, ' 115 undergraduates attended summer 
8e88ion at UCSD, as opposed to approximately 8,000 during 
the fall, winter and spring quarters. 

ViewIN tbat failure, the administration is contemplating-
a .witeb back to the aemester system. Not only would a 
lwitcb anow professors to further launch themselves into 
tbeircounes, it is argued, but conducting registration twice 
_ad of three times a year could save money and 
frustration. 

Despite the disinclination of students to attend school in 
tile summer, the quarter system has provided dividends 
u8foreseen by administrations when it was first adopted, 
aad we favor its retention. 

It provides a diversity and flexibility simply not available 
III the semester system. A greater variety of classes are 
aYaiiable toltUdents, and there is greater flexibility offered 
ower a university career; a quarter off or a slack quarter for 
exira-curricular activities, travel or a job _has a less 
d8magiq effect than a semester away from school. 

Most UC schools, with the partial exception of Berkeley. 
wllich still relies on an antiquated system in which students 
must visit each department to get the classes they want, 
have computerized registration systems, making 
l'IIistration quick. if not painlesss. (Berkeley, not 
incidentally. is the school that started the push for the 
semester system, and is its strongest advocate). 

Finally. a study concluded at UC Irvine two weeks ago 
sllDwed that a switch to the semester system would not save 
subitantial amounts of money. 

The one aJ'lUlllent proponents of semesters push hardest, 
an abiHty to study subjects with greater depth. is true in 
some cases. In most, though, the problem can be remedied 
by using the flexibility of the quarter system to offer two 
and three quarter sequences. 

We urge Paul Saltman and the Vice Chancellors of 
Academic Affairs at each of the other UC campuses now 
considering a chaDle to semesters to reject the idea and 
maintain the quarter system. .

CaIPIRG: 'Stop San Onofre' 
Editor: 

What many have feared for 
so loog has happened: The 
worst nUclear accident in U S 
history at the Three Mile Island 
Nuclear Power Plant in 
Pennsylvania. Fortunately, no 
one has been killed -. yet. 

The utility companies .would 
have us believe that this is due 
to the safety oC the nuclear 
power plaDt itself; I submit that 
it is indeed a fluke that people 
have, so far, escaped without 
apparent and obvious harm 
from the disaster at Harris· 
burg. 

But will people, including 
those in San Diego, be so lucky 
next time? 

The time has come to put our 
collective feet down and simply 
say NO to nuclear power. Not 
since the Vietnam War has the 
need for citizens to speak up 
been so keenly felt. 

The safety factor of nuclear 
power can no longer be ignored 
or swept under the rug. In San 
Diego County, a t San Onofre , 
there exists the very real 
possibility of a similar accident 
like that in Pennsylvania . 

There are no a dequate 
evacuation plans for residents 
of the county in the event of a 
nuclear accident. Less than 
3,000 feet from San Onofre is the 
Christianitos Fault, where two 
earthquakes occured in 1975. A 
new fault, discovered in 1977, is 
less than 1.5 miles from San 
Onofre . No permanent. nuclear 
disposal. system has been 
developed at San Onofre. By 
1990, the San Onofre Nuclear 
Generating Station (SONGS 1) 
will be so radioactive it will be 
forced to be shut down. 

Bitt what can people do? 
Plenty. Licensing hearings for 
two new nuclear generating 

ta tions at S~n Onofre (SONGS 
2 and 3) will take place in the 
fall of 1979 before the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. In 
conjuction with other groups. 
specifically the Community 
Energy Action Network 
(CEAN), Ca lPIRG is dis · 
tributing a petition asking the 
Commi sion not to license these 
two new plants. 

And there are other things to 
do. This week and next . 
CalPIRG will be sta ffing tables 
on campus. We will have 
petitions and nuclear infor· 
mation available. On Friday at 
noon, there will be a rally -
with speakers and music - on 
the UCSD gym steps. And, on 
Saturday, there will be a 
community· wide rally and 
demonstration at 1 pm in 
Balboa Park at Sixth and 
Laurel Streets.

S ome people bave claimed for years that artificial Ugbt,.-especially fluorescent light, is a bealth bazard. Now, a growing number of scientists is finding support for 
such claims. 

"It seems clear that ligbt is the most important 
environmental input, after food, in controlling . bodily 
functfbns ," according to Dr. Richard Wurtman, 
neuroendocrinoiogist at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. "Our exposure to artificial light may have 
harmful effects of whiCh we are not aware." 

This is something Jobn Ott, a self-educated authority on light 
and health. has long argued. "Light is a nutrient like food, and 
like food , the wrong kind can make us ill and the right kind can 
help keep us well," he wrote in his book HeaJ&h and Light. 

As we spend more time indoors, the argument goes, our 
"llght diet" suffers. Our delicate system of biological responses 
to sunlight - developed over millions of years - is disrupted. 

Indoor lighting lacks many of the wavelengths found in the 
visible spectrum of sunlight. Windows, eye· glasses and 
windshields block out 90 percent of the sun's beneficial 
ultraviolet rays. But exposure to the full spectrum of light, 
including ultraviolet, may be necessary for proper bodily 
function. _ 

L ight helps to reeulate body chemistry, espeCially glandular activity. Dr. Wurtman has found that as light . waves strike the eye, they trigger a response in the 
hypothalamus, which affects pituitary function and hormone 
production. 

However, if a wavelenlth is missing from a light source, 
some receptors In the eye fail to respond, provoking a hormonal 
imbalance. 

In studies at Michigan State University, endocrinologist 
Josepb Meltes haa noted an a.sociation between bormonal 
imbalance and cancer growth, diabetes , infertility and thyroid 
disorders. 

Dr. Wurtman observed that rats living under conventional 
white fluorescent light showed silnificant changes In the 
weight of the spleen, heart and lonads. Other laboratory 

studies, with plants and animals, suggest that those kept under 
standard types of artificial light had a higher incidence of 
disease and chromosomal mutation than those raised in 
sunligbt or full spectrum artificial lighting. 

S ucb data, compiled by research,r Katbleen Bernier of Berkeley in a still unpublished report, "Electro-magnetic Radiation and You", supports earlier 
findings by Ott, developed at his Environmental Health and 
Ligbt Research Institute in Florida. . 

USing time-lapse photography, Ott found that removal of 
certain wavelensths, particularly ultraviolet, caused a 
profound disruption oC cellular activity in rabbits' pigment 
epithelial, a layer of retinal cells with no known visual function. 
Ott believes this layer is the photo receptor linked to the 
glandular system. 

In plants, he found, red wavelength incandescent light led to 
cell destruction. Observing rats raised in pink fluorescent light, 
Ott found .sores on tails, calcium deposits in heart tissue, and 
abnormal behavior. 

In another experiment, Ott installed full-spectrum radiation-
shielded fluorescent lighting in a classroom of hyperactive 
children in Sarasota Florida . He reported that after 60 days, the 
children's level of alitation had subsided considerably, and had 
been replaced by a marked improvement in classroom 
behavior and attentiveness. 

B ecause Ott is largely a self·taught scientist, his findings have been challenged by scientists, public utility firms and ligbting manufacturers. 
. Critics do not deny the importance of Jipt in treating ' 

diseases such as rickets, pSOriasis and jaundice in premature 
infants. The question is the Significance of Ott's findinp on 
wavelength deficiency. 

Dr. Kendrick Smith of Stanford University's School of 
Medicine, who Is the former head of the American Society of 
PhotobioloiY, cautions that prooC Is still lacking on the 
harmfulness of artificial light. But he adds that if Ott's findings 
should be corroborated by carefully controlled research, tbey 
"would have far-ranging Importance to all animal research 
a!1dl ultimately, to man. "

Nuke Gas Bubble Safe 

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - A troublesome gas bubble no longer 
,poses any significant danger of explosion at the disabled Three 
'Mile Island nuclear power plant, a federal official said yesterday. 

" I think the danger point is considerably down from where it was 
a few days ago," said Harold Denton of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. "We no longer consider a hydrogen explosion a 
significant problem. The site remains stable .... " 
Meanwhile, speculation arose that the crippled reactor might 
have to be junked, but one NRC official said he doubted that. 

While Denton, President Carter's special representative at the 
scene, held the briefing, tension was easing in the week-long crisis 
caused by the worst nuclear mishap in US history. Civil defense 
officials estimated that between 80,000 and 250,000 of the region's 
950,000 people had temporarily pulled out, but thousands were 
returning yesterday and some schools were reopened. 

Pill Dangers Exaggerated 
NEW YORK (AP) - New statistical studies reported yesterday 

"cast serious doubt" on the validity of British studies which said 
women who have used oral contraceptives are about four times 
more likely to die of cardiovascular diseases. 

One new study also challenged a British study that applied those 
findings to 21 other countries, including the United States, Japan . 
Australia , New Zealand and most of Europe. 

The authors of the new studies cautioned, however, that their 
findings do not mean there is no risk at all associated with use of 
oral contraceptives, but that the risk has been exaggerated and is 
affected by age, smoking and obesity, not " the pill " alone. 

In late 1977, the British medical journal The Lancet carried a 
report from the Royal College of Gene,ral Practitioners ' (RCGP) 
pill study conducted over eight years. It was based on 24 deaths 
from heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular diseases

Market Cafe Shooting 
Hospitalizes Employee 

By Steve Schneider 
An employee of the Market Cafe in Solana Beach was 

seriously injured in a shooting incident that occurred in front of 
the cafe last Saturday night. 

According to a Sheriff's Department spokesman, part-time 
bus boy Louis Alfonso Espinoza, age 22, received a facial gun 
wound and was transported to Scripps Memorial Hospital, 
where he was admitted and listed in critical condition. 

According to the spokesman, the suspect in the case is a male 
Mexican, one of four " undocumented" persons (illeg,al aliens) 
who were reportedly arguing with Espinoza, also an 

, " undocumented" person, before the shooting, which occurred 
at around 10: 30 Saturday night. 

The homicide division of the San Diego County Sheriffs 
Department is conducting an investigation oC the shooting, but 
there are currently no suspects in custody, a department 
spokesman said. 

Espinoza still -has the fragmented bullet in his head, 
according to the spokesman, but his condition has improved to 
the point that although still in intensive care, he is able to talk 
and sit up . A hospital spokesman listed Espinoza 's condition 
yesterday as guarded but stable.

Crew Coach's Enthusiasm Classic 
By Jon Goetz 

Sealor Slaff Wrtler 
Spring signals the thaw for 

many crew teams throughout 
the nation. Time to lower the 
boats into thewateronceagain. 

In San Diego, the crew season 
doesn 't begin so dramatically. 
The new season marks the end 
of six months of pre-season 
workouts in Mission Bay and 
the beginning of competition 
and mot;e workouts. So how can 
you tell when it's time to start in 
this city? 

Look for a very excited coach 
at the Aquatic Center, and 
chances are it's spring. Jack 
Vallerga, in his fifth year at the 
helm of the UCSD men's team 
and his fourth year heading the 
women's team. has retained 
that enthusiasm for his sport 
and his teams. . 

And the 7O-plus UCSD rowers 
are just as eager as Vallerga to 
begio competition this weekend 
at the San Diego Crew Classic 
at Mission Bay.

boats this season. They 
compete in open, lightweight 
(130 lb. maximum) , and novice 
categories in many of the same 
races as the men, then advance 
to the Nationals in Detroit 
during finals week. Heavyweight (160 lb . ' ''!nd . 

above), Lightweight (below. J60 
lb.), Novice, and Freshman 
boats, face a full schedule after 
this weekend. They start 
against Long Beach State, 
UCSB, and Davis , later row 
against USC and USD, then 
compete with Loyola and 81. 
Mary. 

They finish with the city meet 
against SDSU, USD , and the 
Mission Bay Club, then 
advance to the regional 
championships, the Western 
Sprints. 

The Heavyweight crew " is in 
the cliche of a ' rebuilding 
year '," said Vallerga , 
lamenting the loss of nine 
veteran heavyweights from the 
77-78 squad. The lightweight, 
novice, and freshman teams 
remain more of a mystery, but 

all are expected to finish 
strong. 

Two men rowers on the team. 
Art Sloate and Jim Holmes, will 
tryout for the national team 
later on. Sloate, a transfer from 
Orange Coast College, begins 
his first year at UCSD rowing 
thi season. Holmes has the 
physical potential to make that 
national team, but only one 
year of experience. 

The tea)11 will also be relying 
on Scottish coxswain Julian 
Halliday . and " journeymen 
rowers" John Kirchmeyer a nd 
Greg Baaji. " I am reluctant to 
say anyone is a star, however," 
said Vallerga, " rowing is 
different than other sports 
because you ' re literally 
physically connected. It's the 
ultimate in team sports." 

He will identify some of his 

women rowers with proven 
ability though. Susie Luft'ner. 
for instance, is a triple medalist 
in National competition. She 
took the gold Cor her winning 
lightweight eight team , a silver 
medal for her doubles boat, and 
a bronze for her lightweight 
four team. "She's the most 
intense athlete I've ever had," 
said the Triton coach. 

Another proven rower is 
Karen Butler, who is also an 
experienced sailor. She took 
second in the Nationals as a 
high school rower, and just 
missed another medal at last 
year ' s competition , taking 
fourth in the four oar race. 

Luftner and Butler, along 
with veterans Bonnie Sullivan, 
Astrid Holberg, Toria ~rad­
shaw and coxswain Anita 
Desai ; will anchorthe women's 

The lightweight team is fairly 
strong, yet few women of open 
category weight are rowing for 
the Tritons this year. So the 
open eight will be mostly 
lightweights, and that provides 
an interesting situation for the 
team .. 'It puts us in a David and 
Goliath role. " said Vallerga, 
" and I kind of like it. If they 
beat you , you can say that it 
would have turned out 
differently if they were the 
same size." 

"Some teams will under-
estimate us. If they give my 
crew five strokes I'll take it and 
beat them with it. Wecan'tpull 
it off against a solid school like 
Berkeley, but we can do it 
against a school like USC. 
That's the spirit our women 
have."

"The races were short, so if 
you had trouble at the start, it 
was hard to make up (or it ," he 
said. . 'UCSD had problems 
with starts, partly because 
there was too little room at the 
starting line," he added. 

"The starting line was so 
short you couldn' t get all the

element of luck, and we seemed 
to have bad luck," Folkman 
explained.

After a week spent waiting for &he clouds to clear, baseball coach Vince Askey was happy to get 
a dry field last Saturday but he was even happier to get away with a 4-3 victory against highly 
raDked Redlands College. 
, UCSD did all of its scoring in the third inning with catcher Jim Moffit leading off with a boomi 

solo home run. The Tritons continued to bat around in that inning, scoring an additional 
runs on three hits and two walks. In the fourth inning Redlands brought out their ace reliever wh 
shut down the Tritons allowing only one hit in the last six innings. 

In the meantime Triton pitcher Tom Schwartz allowed 11 hits and three runs struggling 
maintain the lead. In &he eighth inning Redlands scored one run and then with one out and men 
first and third attempted a squeeze play. Fortunately, Schwartz handled the bunt and 
into a double at first and home. . ,"".'0 ~ s,_

n the past the subject of the 
Vietna m War wa,s ta boo in 
Holly\,Vood a nd no one dared 

to se riously explore the topic. (J ohn 
Wayne's blindly pa triotic The Green 
Berets doesn 't count). Recently the 
silence has bee n broken, a nd a n 
a bundance of films have dea lt with the 
Vietna m War directly (Go Tell the 
Spartans), indirectly (Who'll Stop the 
Rain) a nd on the home front (Coming 
Home) . Mic hae l Cimino 's The Deer 
Hunter , the lates t of these wa r related 
films , proves to be the best acted and 
most eng rOSSing film o( the year. 

Actua lly, labeling The Deer Hunter 
a " Vietna m Wa r film" is a misnomer 
because a lthough the wa r deeply 
affects the cha r acte rs, it rema ins 
incidenta l to th e s tory (the wa r scenes 
make up the sm a llest portion of the 
film and the wa r could have a lmost . 
been any other wa r). In fa ct , what 
Cimino does not say about the war 
may be wha t angers people . He does 
not turn his film into a forum on the 
rightness or wrongness of the US 
involvement in Vietna m: no one in the 
film ever takes a political position on 
the war. Instead, war is a fact of life 
which Cimino presents as the filnis of 
the 40s presented World War II - men 
eager to go " where the bullets a re 
flying '.' . .!nd prou~ to fight for the US. 

But Cimino's r omanticism a bout war 
ends when his cha racters have to face 
the rea l war . By simply depict ing 
some of the tragic waste and agony of 

_ war, Th e Deer Hunter fina lly comes 
across as a strong sta tem ent a gains t 
wa r in general. 

The true focus of the film is the 
Hemingwayesque cama ra de rie of six 
s tee l workers whose li ves a re 
irre versibly changed when three of 
them go off to wa r . The Hemingway- . 
like s lant of the early part of the film 
revea ls a male-dominate d world 
where ma le bonds of friendship have a 
deeper a nd pure r mea ning than any 
m a le- fe m a le r e la tion ships. Addi -
tiona lly, courage and strength of will 
a re exa lted virtues and only Michael 
truly possesses them. Michael is the 
force tha t holds them together and 
tha t will pull th em through the horrors 
of war especia lly the gam e o f Russia n 
roulette that they a re forced to play. 

Cimino fills his film with a multitude 
of ri tua ls, the meanings of wh ich a re 
left forthe audience to decipher. In one 
insta nce he juxtaposes a ritual of life, 
the wedding, with a ritual of death , the 
wa r. Then he proceeds to uphold the 
wedding tr a dition beca u se it 
represents a positive source of 
sta bility and hope and te ar down the 
wa r because itis destructive . The deer

So you've got a few problems 
with your shape. Don't 
worry about it, do some-
thing about it. And a 
good way to get 
started is by read-
ing the next issue 
of "Insider" -the 
free supplement to 
your college newspaper 
from Ford. 

You'll find tips on exercise, 
training and sports. And you'll discover 
a few of the unusual ways some athletes 
stay in shape. It's not all running and 
weight lifting. And you'lI also find 
some very interesting infOrmation about 
how to shape up your ride with the 
great lineup of '79 Fords.

in ," he said. 

Folkman doesn ' t just blame 
the course. " We'll be working 
on our starts next week," he 
promised. 

During the minutes before a 
race begins, the boats can 
jockey for position and speed so 
that when the gun goes off and 
they a re allowed to cross the 
starting line, they may get a n 
edge. In order to simulate the 
crowded conditions of starting, 
Folkman said the team would 
practice with a very short 
starting line. 

The team's other major 
problem also showed up in the 
third and fourth series last 
month . " We're better in lighter 
wind conditions ," Folkman 
said. A large group will be 
going to Berkeley, to ofCer the 
team the choice of heavier 
skipper and crew, which would 
help in case of windy 
conditions. 

Another condition that will be 
different at Berkeley is that the 
teams have to switch boats for 
each of the fifteen races, so that 
any advantage UCSD may have 
gotten from their new boats. 
specially rigged for inter-
collegiate racing but also a bit 
lighter than average. will be

DeNiro 
Excels in 
'Hunter' 

(Continued from page 9) 
make The Deer Hunter worth 
viewing. At the top of the list 
stands DeNiro's portrayal of 
Michael , " the control freak." 
DeNiro 's Michael has a 
controlled intensity. powerfol 
strength of will and a fierce 
loyalty to his friends . DeNiro 
has that rare talent which 
a llows him to become his 
character a nd to give his 
character a rea lity outside of 
the film . He can also convey his 
character's deepest emotions 
with a mere silent close-up. 

The supporting cast also 
excels. Christopher Walken as 
the mentally scarred Nick. 
delivers a ha unting perfor· 
mance and John Savage a the 
fragile Steven gives a poigna nt 
portrayal. As the only female 
character of merit. Meryl 
Streep conveys a freshness and 
radiance which is welcome. 

The Deer Hunter thoroughly 
engrosses the audience in its 
story and , despite some 

I,structural flaws, remains 
powerfully moving. One should 
be forewarned, though. that the 
scenes dealing with the Russian 
roulette are graphic and 
emotionally painful , but they 
are essential to the story. 
Despite the pain and bloodshed 
of the film, itends hopefully and 
with a reaffirmation of life. The 
Deer Hunter does not try to 
answer questions about the 
Vietnam war but rather it 
offers a deeply affecting story 
of friendship and the will to 
survive. The Deer Hunter is 
now playing at the Cinema 
Grossmont.
