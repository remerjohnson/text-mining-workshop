Eleanor Roosevelt and to the college which now 
bears her name. 

"[Eleanor Roosevelt] is not only a model for 
me, but I hope that she will be a model for all 
generations of Americans, and indeed, this col-
lege helps assure this," Clinton said during her 
speech to a capacity crowd at the RIMAC arena. 

A "die-hard Eleanor Roosevelt fan," Clinton 
said that Mrs. Roosevelt should serve as a role 
model for everyone because of the "humanity 
and dignity with which she led her life."

Symposium 
Reviews 
Human 
Rights Policy 
UNITED NATIONS: Success 
of humanitarian aid missions 
assessed during Friday's forum 
By Marianne VIgil 
News Editor 
and Karen Cheng 
Senior Staff Writer 

In 1948, the United Nation penned the his-
toric Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Using this sweeping document as a foundation, 
the International Human Rights Symposium, 
sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt College, ad-
dressed the issues of citizenship, human rights 
and the role of the United Nations on Friday at 
the Price Center Ballroom. 

The day-long symposium featured experts 
from around the country. During the first ses-
sion, Susan Woodward, from the Brookings 
Institution, and Thomas Farer, from American 
University, discussed U.N. intervention in Yu-
goslavia and Somalia. 

According to Woodward and Farer, the fail-
ure of the U.N. Somalia relief mission, the 
continuing war in the former Yugoslavia and 
the genocide that took place in the central Afri-
can nation of Rwanda last year were all ex-
amples of the outcome of failed U.S. foreign 
policy. 

Woodward, who spent last year working as a 
senior staff advisor for the United Nations in 
Croatia, said that people in the United States 
have the mistaken impression that the Balkan 
war was inevitable because of pent-up ethnic 
and religious animosity. 

According to Woodward, while the U.N. 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a 
"momentous achievement," it has not been up-
held and, in fact, has led to a very difficult 
conflict. The fighting in the former Yugoslavia, 
said Woodwal~, is the conflict between indi-
vidual rights an~ collective, self-determination 
rights. Human rights are being violated brutally 
in the name of self-determination of peoples,

Lightning Fails to Strike in Miami for San Diego Chargers 
SUPER BOWL: 
Chargers' defeat causes 
elation and mourning 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

Weeks of Super Bowl hype ended 
in disappointment for San Diego 
Chargers fans Sunday as the home 
team was defeated 49-26 by the five-
time champion 4gers. 

At the Eleanor Roosevelt Col-
lege dedication, first lady Hillary 
Clinton aid, "after the earthquake 
and the floods and the other prob-
lems you've been faced with, Cali-
fornia de erves the Super Bowl." 

However, at UCSD, the middle 

of Bolt territory, roommate was pit-
ted against roommate and friend 
against friend as team loyalty came 
to the fore. 

In the aftermath of the Super 
Bowl, UCSD students from both 
sides had mixed reactions. 

Former Charger Girl Aimee Jef-
frey, a Roosevelt College seniorwho 
grew up in San Francisco, said she 
did not know who she would root 
for before the game. "I would have 
been happy either way," she said. 

Forty-niners fan and Revelle 
College junior Phillip Gaffin aid 
he thought all the Charger hoopla 
over the past weeks wa good for 
San Diego, and hoped it would not 
end with loss. 

Chargers fan Matt Matzkin, a 
Warren College sophomore, said 
that he will remain loyal to the 
Chargers. "I'm going to wear my 
Chargers hat tomorrow and I hope 
that everyone else does, too." 

Other Charger fans differed in 
their team spirit. Revelle Senior 
Kathy Caldwell called the Charg-
ers' performance" ad. " 

However, fellow fan Andre 
Conde, a Mar hall College senior, 
disagreed, aying that the 4gers are 
good, "but I'm not going to give 
them more credit than they deserve." 

A all the Thunderbolts are taken 
down acro San Diego in the next 
few days, UCSD tudents join be-
hind one team again - the Triton.

The loss of both her parents by 
the time she was IO-years-old and 
the infidelitiesofher husband served 
to give Mrs. Roosevelt a unique

Clinton said.

At the conclusion of her speech, 
Clinton said that we all have an 
obligation to assure that America's 
best days are still to come. 

"I hope for all of you that the 
values and ideals that this college 
represents will not merely be a way

but be a beacon for you to live by 
and for you to help guide others to

Harvard Professor Doris Keams 
Goodwin, who wrote No Ordinary 

tablish a separate 
general to deal with Mrs. Roosevelt's 
memos. 

After her husband died, Eleanor 
toured the country and according to 
Goodwin, saw the results of her and 
her husband's efforts for the first 
time. 

" She had fought her husband on 
so many issues ... she had lost sight 
of the larger picture. The country 
had indeed become more socially 
just," Goodwin said. 

However, it was Goodwin's ac-
knowledgment of Mrs. Clinton that 
received the loudest cheers.

Defense Grants UCSD $7.5 Million 
The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded a 

total of n.5 million in grants over the next five years 
to two UCSD high-speed communications research 
programs. 

The two projects, a wireless multimedia "digital 
battlefield" and fiber-<>ptic transmissions, were funded 
by the Defense Department's Focused Research Ini-
tiative. The initiative was created to support academic 
and industrial collaborative projects. It will fund up to 
16 projects worth a maximum of $100 million. 

The initiative gave $5 million to the "digital battle-
field" project which would allow the military to transmit 
information through wireless multimedia technology. 

"In this scenario, the Armed Forces would like to 
use this technology to have as much information as 
possible in as many places as possible and have it 
with complete flexibility in terms of motion," said 
Laurence Milstein, director of UCSD's Center for Wire-
less Communications. 

The second project, granted $2.5 million, will 
involve the high-speed transmission of complex im-
ages over fiber-optics networks. 

The goal is to transmit both medical and biomedi· 
cal research images long-<listances so that the sender 
and recipient could simultaneously use the same 
information. 

Shaya Fainman, UCSD associate professor of elec-
trical and computer engineering, said, "images could 
be transmitted from a ship's clinic to someone who 
has expertise in a certain area that the shipboard 
physician needs."

THE 
FIRST LADY 
.. SPEAKS 

The UCSD Guardian 

An Ex~lusive Interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton 
By Jonna Palmer 
News Editor 
and Marianne VIgil 
News Editor 

First lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton took time out after her key-
note address at the dedication of 
Eleanor Roosevelt College for an 
exclusive interview with the GU4rd-
ian Thursday. Clinton spoke about 
the difficulties of her position, her 
close identification with Eleanor 
Roosevelt and White House plans 
for helping students meet the rising 
costs of college. Below are excerpts 
from that interview. 

au.dI-= ElelnorllooMveIt 
redeftned tile role of not only 
tile first Iedy but of women In 
.......... You hu. recelyed 
criticism for your .ay. role 
In .... president'. potier ..... 
..... How nwcII _ye ........ 
.... 11y eunced ... 10 , ... , 

Clinton: Well, that's a good 
question, and I don't know that I'm 
the person to answer it, because I 
feel like I'm right in the middle of 
all that is going on. But I think that 
Mrs. Roosevelt was unique in sev-

eral respects because she truly was a 
woman ahead of her time, the way 
that she carved out her own position 
and served as her husband's partner 
in his work, often standing in for 
him when he could not himself do 
something. And every time anyone 
says to me that I've done somelhing 
perfect, [I say to them), "Well, you 
haven't read about Mrs. Roosevelt 
and what she has done." 

But I think today we still have 
lingering attitudes that were used 
against her and it's a continuing evo-
lution for women to be given the 
opportunity to make their own 
choices. But it is true that we've 
made a lot of progress and Mrs. 
Roosevelt,· I've been told, had said 
that she knew that she was consid-
ered kind of a person outside the 
mainstream of political and social 
life, and although she was criticized, 
she wasn't seen as threatening. And 
I think, if you look at what was said 
about, oh, Mrs. Ford or Mrs. Carter 
or some of Ihe other women who've 
been in this position, it's always a 
position that draws crilicism, almost 
no matter what you do. 

au.dIM: Two ,H'. ICo

Clinton: Well, a lot of things 
have happened that should have 
helped students with college costs, 
and I hope through your newspaper 
you can publicize that. The presi-
dent changed the way loans are given 
to students and the loans should be 
cheaper and more avai lab Ie now than 
they were two years ago. He's also 
begun his National Service Project 
which gives students, in return for 
community service, money toward 
payingforcollege. And in his middle 
class bill of rights, he has made it 
absolutely a priority that families be 
able to deduct the costs of a college 
education. So I think Ihat any stu-
denl who cares about the future and 
about the costs of college should 
strongly support the president be-
cause of what he's already done and 
what he's trying to do. 

COLLEGE: 
ContInued from pace 2 

Calling Hillary Clinton "the 
modem counterpart of the extraor-
dinary woman after whom this col-
lege is named," Goodwin said that 
like Mrs. Roosevelt, the current 
first lady "has steadfastly perse-
vered despite criticism in her ef-
forts to help all Americans live 
fuller lives .. . And, like Eleanor, 
she will be remembered with love 
and admiration long after the voices 
of her adversaries have been 
slilled. "

The ceremony formally dedi-

cated Fifth College as the first 
American college or universily to 
be named after Eleanor Roosevelt, 
although the final approval came 
during last May's UC Board of 
Regents meeting. 

At Thursday's dedication, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College Pro-
vost Ann Craig said that the re-
gents "concluded that she embod-
ied the highest standard of public 
service and responsible world citi-
zenship. A standard we proudly 
set for our students today."

that she serves as

DC Regents sit pretly whJe 
student fees increase so quiclJy 
that famJy incomes can't keep up 

Surprise! The UC regents are raising the costs of education again, which " isn't surprising since they 've been raising fees every year for the last 
eight years. Perhaps "raising" is not the ap-
propriate term. "Is it a bird, is it a plane?" 
is what comes to mind. 

For those of you who don't know, fees 

decided to spend more mOQey on prisons 
and less on higher education. As we all 
know, prisons are the wave of the future, 
especially after California passed the incon-
ceivab[y idiotic "three strikes" legislation. 

In 1995, more money will be spent on 
prisons than on CSUs and UCS combined 
for the first time ever. Ten years ago, the 

have increased since 1990 
at the ridiculous rate of 
roughly $500 dollars per 
year. Next year, under-
graduates will spend a 
minimum of $4,500 per 
year to attend a Uc. UCSD 
students must pay an extra 
$210 per year for RIMAC, 
a recreation facility we 
didn ' t order. 

If we had mountains of 
cash to spend on our edu-
cations, many of us would 
have gone to Stanford or 
University of San Diego. 
As was envi s ioned by 
California 's Master Plan, 
for years, the UC had been 
able to provide comparable, 
if not better, education at a 
low cost to any qualified 
student. Today, however, no

same schools received more 
than twice of what prisons 
received. 

Wilson also proposes to 
increase correctional em-
ployees by 7.5 percent 
(2,879) and decrease 
higher-education em-
ployees by 1.1 percent 
(968). Moreover, Cali-
fornia prison guards 
earn 58 percent 
more than the na-
tional average for 
prison guards , 
whereas UC profes-
sors earn 12.6 per-
cent less than pro-
fessors at compa-
rable universities 
outside of Cali-
fornia . Wilson is 
going for 
higher 

class family can afford to put children 
through the UC without ample financial aid 
or student loans. And fees are scheduled to 
keep increasing until the year 2000. 

According to UC President Jack 
Peltason, "Increases will be predictable, so 
students and their families can plan for 
them." That's awfully nice, except for the 
fact that we've been planning on fee hikes 
anyway. Many of us will begin our adult 
lives indebted to Educaid.

ETS CREATES MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVES 
Editor: 

Nancy Cole, president of Educa-
tional Testing Service (ETS), con-
tends that test preparation compa-
nies are attacking the computer-
adaptive Graduate Record Exami-
nation (GRE) because it "hurts our 
busine~. "_Wrong. We are attacking 
the test because there are serious 
problems with its formal. The test 
security issue has been brought to 
ETS's allention for over a year by 
several companies; ETS only re-
cently acknowledged that there are 
some problems. Its solution to of-
fer the test only one week per month 
starting in February, will do noth-
ing to resolve the current problems. 
Once again, ETS's actions have 
served no purpose except to hurt the 
students who need to take the test. 

The problem is that there are 
simply not enough questions in the 
computer. ETS claims that there will 
be a larger pool of questions soon. 
However, it took over three years 
to create the current pool, so how 
can it accurately create more ques-
tions in such a short time? Clearly, 
ETS needs to worry about improv-
ing the exam rather than attacking 
test preparation companies. 

Cole also assumes that test 
preparation companies do not have 
the resources or technology to pre-
pare students for a computerized 
exam. Wrong again. The subject 

material on the test has remained the 
same, but the structure of the test 
has not. In light of this development, 
we created a computer-adaptive 
GRE course in addition to the pa-
per-and-pencil course which we 
have been running for years. We are 
having a gr~t deal of success with 
our Computer Adaptive GRE 
course, and find its format very con-
ducive to large score increases. 

Why are we so concerned? Cur-
rently, the paper-and-pencil exam is 
only offered a few times per year, 
and it is expected that it will be of-
fered only three times per year in 
1995-96. ETS is planning to phase 
out this test by 1997, making the 
computer-adaptive GRE the only 
option for students. ETS will be 
making more money: The com-
puter-adaptive test is far more ex-
pensive ($96) than the paper-and-
pencil exam ($56). If this is the test 
of the future, then some serious 
changes need to be made now.

Us," Jan. 12). He states, "Like so 
many others who the U.S. Post Of-
fice forces to subsidize its socialist 
boondoggle, I also tried to pur-
chase ... three cent stamps to use up 
my leftover 29 cent antiques." To 
the contrary, nobody is forced to 
subsidize the U.S. Postal Service, as 
there are many private firms ready, 
willing and able to carry out 
Ludlow's postal needs (i.e. Fed Ex, 
UPS, etc.), and I can't help but won-
der if he has bothered to price the 

service costs of these companies. 
Rest assured, you won 't find any 
other service for 32 cents. 

Ludlow complains of the long 
lines at the post office. Has he been 
to a movie or restaurant lately? A[so, 
[ think he might be surprised at the 
low loss and mutilat ion figures 
(about three percent) when the total 
amount of material which the post 
office processes on a daily basis is 
taken into account. 

Finally, it is quite obvious that 
Lud[ow has never lived outside of 
the United States, for if he had, he 
would be well aware that for the low 
price of 32 cents, the U.S. Postal 
Service provides mail service which 
many other countries can only hope 
to emulate. 

I am now going to mail this letter 
to the GUlJrt&n. 1 am quite confident 
that it will get there safe and sound.

Is execution and the moments 

proceeding it not the utmost form 
of torture? In civilized societies, like 
the United States of America, tor-
ture is condemned. What about the 
death penalty? 

In Sweden, we have read reports 
which reveal that executions have

become more common and that the 
number of death sentences has in-
creased in your country. This in-
cludes California. We are deeply 
concerned by this development. 

By using the death penalty, the 
state approves of capital punishment 
as a way to solve problems. Instead 
of prevent ing violence, the state 
perpetuates its brutality. 

How can the state decide who 
has the right "to live? Death sen-
tences often discriminate against 
weaker minority groups in society, 
and the risk of sentencing innocent 
people to death can never be elimi-
nated. Execution is irrevocable. 
According to Bedau and Radelet 
("Miscarriages of Justice In Poten-
tially Capita[ Cases," Stanford Law 
Review, 1987), 349 people, whose 
innocence was later proved, were 
sentenced to death in the United 
States between 1900 and 1985. Of 
these, 23 were actually executed. 

It is our firm conviction that the 
use of capital punishment is inhu-
man. With the death penalty, the 
state commits the very crime it has 
decided to condemn. 

We know that many people share 
our views, but we still feel obliged 
to once again call attention to this 
matter.

MONEY: 
Administrative self-
rewarding is killing 
the UC system 
Continued from.,..e 4 
ously self-lavishing, a trait demon-
strated in 1992 when retiring UC 
Presidenl David Pierpont Gardner 
received a severance package of 
more than $800,000. 

This practice of rewarding them-
selves and other high-placed UC of-
ficials continues. Last year, the re-
gents voted 13-5 to give raises to 
13 top hospital officials, who were 
already among the highest-paid UC 
employees. Yet, other hospital em-
ployees were forced to accept pay 
cuts. 

Last March, regents attempted to 
give a UC official transferring from 
Berkeley to San Francisco a 
$34,000 pay increase, inflating his 
salary to a total of $150,000. The 
official was willing to accept 
$135,000, as he had already re-
ceived a raise earlier in the year. 
Apparently, the board decided to 
play hardball, and only gave the of-
ficial an increase of $9,500. 

The regents have tried to keep a 
lid on their expenditures by hold-
ing closed meetings. This prompted 
California Sen. Bill Lockyer to call 
the regents "grubby, self-interested 
individuals .... 

"They have been hammered for 
two years and they still conspire in 
ways that are disrespectful to the 
taxpayers and elected policy-mak-
ers," Lockyer said. 

But wait - there's more blame 
to pour on. 

There is, of course, that rascally 
old "California Apathy." First, vot-

ers have afforded the governor the 
power to give and take away 
money from the state's highercdu-
cation. We set ourselves up. Gov. 
Wilson is more concerned with in-
carcerating repeat offenders for life 
than educating the future of the 
state. Second, we allowed 25 re-
gents to have . absolute autonomy 
over the UC. The public has no say 
as to which direction the largest 
educational institution in the coun-
try - maybe even the world -
takes. california's higher educa-
tion system has fallen apart due to 
the bungling of a misguided gov-
ernor, and the excessive greed of 
the regents. 

We, as students, can do two 
things to ensure our educational sur-
vival: Finish lower division courses 
at a community college, and then 
return to the UC and spend more in 
two years than one would have 
spent in four during the 1980s; or 
move to another state, such as Texas 
or Nebraska, spend a year getting 

residency, and then attend an i n-
state university. 

The current climate has forced 
many students to drop out com-
pletely. Enrollment in California's 
public schools decreased eight per-
cent between 1992 and 1993, by far 
the largest drop in the country. If 
you are forced out of school be-
cause of financial hardship, you 
certainly would not be the first, nor 
the last. 

The reality of California public 
higher education is that it will never 
again be the way it was. The 
"golden age of education" has fol-
lowed the way of the 25 cent stamp 
and dollar-per-gallon gas. Even if 
the state were to completely re-
cover from its economic recession, 
it is unlikely, if not impossible, that 
California will return to its enlight-
ened principle of providing educa-
tion for everyone. California's re-
cent economic setback will inhibit 
its citizens long after the recession 
is gone.

FORUM: 
Continued from page 1 
according to Woodward. 

The rights established by the U.N. 
Declaration of Human Rights "have 
become weapons and reasons for 
war," she said. According to 
Woodward, these rights are a beign 
used by both sides as justification 
for th' atrocities currently being 
committed. 

Thomas Farer continued by dis-
cussing the implications of the mas-
sacre of tens of thousands of 
Rwandans last year and the humani-
tarian mission in Somalia. 

According to Farer, the killing in 
Rwanda was possibly the worst in 
history in terms of a percentage of a 
population destroyed. Perhaps most 
tragic, he said, is that it was allowed 
to happen. 

Although the killing was carried 
out by members of what Farer char· 
acterized as a disheveled and poorly 
equipped army which military in-
tervention could have "stopped in 
its tracks," no action was taken, he 
said. 

The 3,000 U.N. troops stationed 
in Rwanda were removed when the 
contlict erue!ed. 

"No country was more insistent 
that U.N. forces be withdrawn ... 
than the Uniled States," said Farer, 
adding that President Bill Clinton 
made that decision because he felt 
he needed to avoid "another Soma-
lia." 

However, Farer said he felt that 
the international community learned 
the wrong lesson from the Somalia 
intervention. According to Farer, the 
relief mission in Somalia began suc-
cessfully, People were provided with 
food and tens of thousands of lives 
were saved. 

It is especially disappointing that 
the U.N. mission ended in failure, 
Farer said, because "Somalia was 
the only genuinely humanitarian in-
tervention in the history of the 
world." •. _./ 

The keynote speaker, Doris 
Kearns Goodwin, is the author of an 
autobiography of Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt's life entitled, No 
Ordinary Time : Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt: the Home Front 
During World War II. 

Kearns gave personal insight into 
the life of Eleanor Roosevelt in her 
keynote address during the sympo-
sium. Mrs. Roosevelt was a driving 
force behind the Universal Declara-

The UCSD Guardian 

tion of Human Rights and spent 
much of her life defending civil 
rights both here and around the 
world. 

Kearns described Eleanor 
Roosevelt as the "ethical goad to the 
president" and stressed the impor-
tant effect that she had upon her 
husband 's presidency and on the 
nation."Eleanor and Franklin's part-
nership is unparalleled in American 
history, " she said. 

After her husband's death, Mrs. 
Roosevelt continued to push New 
Deal programs and became a key 
figure in drafting the United Na-
tions Universal Declaration of Hu-
man Rights in 1948. 

In the afternoon, the audience 
broke into smaller groups and at· 
tended one of four discussion ses-
sions: Rights for Women and Fami-
lies, the Rights of Criminals, Citi-
zenship and Voting Rights, and Citi-
zenship and Basic Human Needs. 

The forums were designed to in-
tegrate Eleanor Roosevelt College 
students, staff and faculty, and to 
find viable solutions to human rights 
and citizenship problems.

The Triton women's swim team was head and shoulders above the rest·ln a recent home meet. 

Women Crush Claremont 
SPLIT BILL: UCSD men's squad struggles against UC Davis and CMC, 
falling 73-61 and 95-32; the women crunch the visiting Athenas, 83-54 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

It was an up-and·down meet for 
the UCSD swimming and diving 
squads when UC Davis and 

Claremont Col· 
lege rolled into 
La Jolla this 
weekend. 

The men 
struggled to 
find their way 
against Davis 
and Claremont, 
falling to both 
teams. They 
suffered a nar· 
row defeat al 

the hands of the Aggies, 73·61, and 
were blown out of the water by a 
strong Stags team, 95·32. 

UCSD's Adam Burgasser carried 
the lone torch for the men in the div· 
ing events, as teammate Josh Curtiss 
paced the edges of the pool with an 
injured back. 

Burgasser did his share to score 
points for the team, tallying a first-
place finish in the three·meter 
springboard event, which was sup-
posed to be a heated duel between 

W.HOOPS: 
Tritons top Tigers 
Continued from pale 16 
it up another notch, pulling away 
from the Tigers as the first half drew 
to a close. 

Michelle Henricks nailed a pair 
of driving jumpers, while Stacy 
Patsko worked her magic in the 
paint, scoring four more points and 
raising the lead to 45·26. 

At the outset of the second half, 
Occidental ran off seven unan· 
swered points and was threatening 
to come back. UCSD never pan· 
icked, though. Led by the hot shoot· 
ing of Jeffries (16 points), the Tri· 
tons reestablished control. 

"[Jeffries] did an excellent job of 
running the offense," Malone said. 
"She basically took their point guard 
out of the game." 

It was an inside move by Patsko 
and a stop·and·pop jumper from 
Jeffries that began the Tritons' sec· 

Da ~is' Dave Ritchie and himself. As 
the meet progressed, Burgasser con-
tinued to score well, tallying a sec-
ond·place mark on the one-meter 
board. 

"[Burgasser] wasc\early the bet-
ter diver," Head Diving Coach Mike 
Fitchett said. 

Burgasser also tallied the "dive 
of the day" for UCSD when he cut 
into the water on a well·executed 
back one-and-a-half with two·and· 
a·half twists - a dive that earned 
him several seven·and·a·halves 
from the judges. 

Kaley Parkinson was one of the 
bright spots for the struggl ing Tri· 
ton swim team, making a strong im· 
pression in the 100- and 200·yard 
freestyle races. 

"Parkinson had three really good 
swims," Head Swimming Coach 
Doug Boyd said. 

UCSD's Ed Ruth stormed to vic· 
tory in the lOOO-yard freestyle race, 
but his win was the only triumph for 
the Tritons on the men's side. 

"I thought maybe we would step 
up, but we didn'tt Boyd said. "[The 
men] are still trying to find a way 
to consistently swim well as a 

ond-half run. 
A deep three·point bomb from 

Henricks gave UCSD a command· 
ing 57-41 edge, and after a Tiger 
free throw Bayda continued to ex· 
tend the margin by cruising in for 
the layup. She was fouled on the 
play, and after converting a point 
from the charity stripe, the Tritons 
were in full control, 60·42. 

UCSD extended its lead to 20 
when Patsko layed in a pretty pass 

. from Henricks late in the game. The 
Tritons (11-5) then cruised to the 
victory with a final tally of 82·65. 

UCSD dominated the boards, 
out.rebounding the Tigers 51·30 
and reaping the benefits. In addition, 
the Tritons finally pulled out of their 
shooting slump, posting a .478 
shooting percentage from the field 
and a .750 percentage from the free· 
throw line. 

"Our defense stepped up and our 
rebounding was much beller," 
Malone said. "We put together two 
good halves." 

team." 
On the women's side,the success 

was much more widespread. In their 
events, the Tritons only competed 
against Claremont, and UCSD took 
full advantage. The Tritons cruised 
away with an 83·54 triumph over 
the Athenas, thanks to a dominat· 
ing performance by the divers. 

Sheri Takeuchi paced the Tri-
tons' aerial attack by grabbing the 
top sQOt in the three·meter spring-
board. She was followed closely by 
Kristi Young and Brigitte Elfman, 
who teamed up to complete the 
UCSDsweep. 

. In the one·meter board, the 
women again took the top·three 
places to extend an already insur· 
mountable Triton lead in the meet. 

The lead in question had been 
amassed through the consistant ef-
forts of swimmers such as Shawna 
Caballero and Carrie Parker among 
others. Caballero dominated in the 
50· and tOO-yard freestyle races, 
while Parker shone in tbe 100- and 
2OO·yard backstrokes. 

"The women definitely swam 
well," Boyd said.

M.HOOPS: 
Slug UC Santa Cruz 
Continued from pac- 18 
more of the same, driving the lane 
for a left· handed layup to put UCSD 
up, 29-23. 

The Banana Slugs crawled back 
to within four at the 12:03 mark, but 
Barnes single handedly took over 
the game. fOJ a solid three-minute 
period, the hustling guard did ev· 
erything for the Tritons, from sti -
fling defense to pin-point shooting. 

"[Barnes] has worked extremely 
hard this year," Lanthier said. "He's 
a streaky shooter .. . and he's got a 
lot of heart." . 

It began when Barnes nailed a 
"sideways-spin" three-pointer, in· 
creasing the Triton lead to 34-25. He 
then drew an offensive foul , swished 
two free throws, stole the ball back 
and fed Aune for an easy two. 

A bullet pass from Mark Sebek 
(12 points, 2-5 on treys) to Mike 
Ensley closed out UCSD's scoring 
in the half, and the Tritons retired 
to the locker room with a 50-35 lead. 

Barnes got the ball rolling for the 
Tritons again in the second half, 
tossing in a short deuce and then 
racing down the court to draw a 
charge on the other end. 

UCSD guard Jason Jones traded 
hoops back and forth with Minehan 
to extend the Triton lead to 21 with 
9:05 left in the game. 

UCSC's offense, pressured and 
hassled, could never get into a 
rhythm throughout the second half. 
The Tritons harassed the Banana 
Slugs with vengeance, particularly 
6'8" center John "Opie" Wooley, to 
force 32 total turnovers. 

With 8:20 left, UCSD's flashy 
forward, Kahlil Allen (13 points), 
put the exclamation point on the 
impending victory with a monster, 
two-handed hanging jam to make 
the score 76-53. 

As early as the 7:00 mark, it was 
slop ball. The Banana Slugs limped 
to the finish, and UCSD took its first 
step towards the respectable _500 
plateau. 

"[A .500 record] is going to be 
close," Lanthier said. "We need an 
upset over Chapman to get it done." 

NINERS: The 
Bolt is finally dead 
Continued from pee_ 16 
determ ination. 

Their adversaries, the 4gers, 
were the Goliath of professional 
football: an unbeatable juggernaut 
that annihilated its opponents, 
laughing all the way. 

Possessed of a physical, impreg. 
nable defense and an unflapable 
scoring machine of an offense, it 
almost seemed unfair that a team 
could be that good. 

But Bolt fans never wavered . 
Having witnessed the way their 
team had beaten out seemingly im· 
possible odds time and time again, 
they were convinced of their team 's 
abilities to do it again against the 
cocky, complacent favorites_ 

After all, Rocky beat Apollo 
Creed; the tortoise outwitted the 
hare; Luke Skywalker out-dueled 
Darth Vader. 

However, with Steve Young's 
all-too-easy touchdown pass to 
Jerry Rice, fantasy faded into the 
reality of a 49-26 rout. 

In the real world, the Davids 
don'ulways win. The Chargers had 
been the Little Engine That Could. 
The Niners, however, were the mon-
strous freight engine that ran them 
off the track.

Tritons Gain Experience, LOse Two 
FAWNG: UCSD slips in two tough matches 
against UC Santa Barbara and CSU Northridge 
By Jeremy Mal.meet 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD volleyball team got 
a good look at where it stands early 
on in this new season, and it got a 

appointed. 

good idea of 
where it needs 
to be if it is to 
be taken seri-
ously o n the 
Divisio n I 
level. 

Looking to 
come out of the 
weekend 
games with at 
least one win, 
UCSD instead 
came away dis-

In their opening matches of 
league play, the Triton spikers were 
handily overpowered by Cal State 
Northridge and UC Santa Barbara. 
When it was all over, UCSD had 
been completely manhandled by its 
big-time Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation opponents. 

On Friday afternoon, the CSU 
Northridge Matadors (1-1) came to 
town and flexed their muscles for 
the RIMAC crowd - and the host 

Tritons. 
Dodging bullets by Northridge 

senior Jon Baer (20 kills) all night, 
UCSD (0-3) never really got going 
in the match, falling behind 6-0 
early on in game one. The Matadors 
then cruised, finishing off the open-
ing game, 15-4. 

Game two began on a better note 
for UCSD, as the two teams battled 
back and forth at one another. With 
the Tritons trailing 6-5, Sophomore 
setter Satao Minami went down 
with an ankle injury and was forced 
to leave the game. Following the 
injury, CSUN regained control of 
the match and took game two, 15-
7. 

Game three saw Northridge 
jump off to another quick edge. 
They led 5-1 - and eventually 9-4 
- before UCSD put together an ex-
citing run that was energized by the 
play of Junior reserve Ed 
McMahon. 

McMahon thoroughly impressed 
the RJMAC faithful by leading his 
team back with his 12 much-needed 
kills off the bench. His strong play 
got the Tritons back in the game, and 
they closed the gap to 12-10. 

The Tritons fought hard for the 
remainder of the 
game, but their 
late run came up 
short . 
Northridge fin-
ished off the 
sweep by secur-
ing game three, 
15-12. 

Saturday 
night, the 
RIMAC arena 
played host to 
UC Santa Bar-
bara (3-2). Right 
off the bat, it ap-
peared as if the 
Gauchos would 
make quick 
work of the un-
enthusiastic Tri-
ton team. 

TIm Chen/ Guard/an 
The Tritons struaJed ...... t fterce bIockJn, of Division I foes CSU Northrld,e and UCSB. 
fully motivate the tired Tritons. 

Santa Barbara proccded to run

his team 's assault with 11 kills and

full advantage of 29 glaring Triton 
errors en route to its second league

"We came out very unenthusias-

game, but we looked a lot better in 
games two and three," said UCSD 
Head Coach Doug Dannevik.

spot, however, chalking up another 
solid weekend with 12 ki lls against 
Northridge and 13 versus UCSB. 

" It has become apparent that we 
are physically overmatched by these 
bigger schools. We have to playa

DAN SWEENEY 

Goliath Beat 
David ... 

Bolt-Mania is over. 
Thank God. 

Tritons Salt Banana Slugs 
As a Niners fan, the last 

two weeks of Charger fever 
have been, to put it mildly, 
irritating. My senses have been 
endlessly bombarded with that 
accursed yellow lightning bolt 
that graces everything from 
sport-jackets to flannel 
underwear. 

In addition, I have been 
endlessly subjected to two 
weeks of overwrought Charger 
media coverage - a horrid 
punishment I would not will 
upon my worst enemy. 

I swear, if third-string 
quarterback Jeff Brohm had 
chipped a nail on his left pinky 
finger, the revelation would 
have commanded a space on 
the front page of the Union-
Tribune. 

But what could I do, other 
than humor those freaks 
wearing their "Believe in the 
Bolts" T-shirts and ridiculous 
Junior "Say-Ow!" baseball 
caps? What course of action 
could I take but to smile 
smugly while those same 
people sing that dreadful "San 
Diego - Super Chargers!" 
theme song out of tune? 

At least I could take solace 
in the fact that, come Super 
Bowl Sunday, my Niners . 
would kick the living crap out 
of San Diego's darling Bolts. 
Finally, 1 would be able to 
gloat, "I told ya so!" 

How fitting was it that, 
after this half-month of pure, 
unadulterated Charger hell, my 
4gers ended up mining gold in 
the Big Game?

BLOWOUT: UCSD men's 
hoopsters steamroll UCSC 
with pressure defense, 94-74 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

The only suspense left at the end of the 
UCSD men's basketball game last Friday was 
whether or not Triton third-string backup cen-

ter Sonny Bazbaz would 
score. 

He did. Twice. 
It was that kind of 

game for UCSD: a blow-
out win in front of the 
RIMAC rowdies, a con-
test in which all but two 
players left their mark in 
the "points scored" col-
umn, and a harsh lesson 
for a fellow UC school 
with a silly mascot. 

In fact, when the last second of the clock 
had expired, the Tritons not only thoroughly 
dismantled UC Santa Cruz, 94-74, but they 
also nearly auctioned off all the parts. 

"I thought we played well," Head Coach 
Greg Lanthier said. "But we can't afford to 
shoot like that and expect to win every time." 

The opening basket gave all 1,823 "Spirit 
Night" fans something to shout about. Fresh-
man Jason Barnes (11 points) left his man eat-
ing his sneaker dust en route to an easy layup. 

UCSD then immediately jumped out to a 
14-6 lead. This was mainly due to the work 
of center Matt Aune (22 points, six rebounds), 
who opened up his arsenal during the game, 
hitting baby hooks and drawing dozens of 
fouls. At one point, Aune set up and calml 
drained a trey from the front of the circle. 

Triton teammate Matt Minehan replaced 
Aune with 15: 11 left in the half and produced 

See M. HOOPS, Page 11 

And now that it's over-
now that the Charger fans have 
crawled back under their rocks 
from whence they came and 
real news has returned to the 
local newspapers - I can 
reflect on what might have 
caused this recent bout of Bolt 
fever. 

Tritons Tear Tigers for 11th Victory 
< 

If their season had been a 
Disney movie, undoubtedly the 
Chargers would be the ones 
brandishing their Super Bowl 
rings on their miserable, 
grubby fingers. In fact, until 
yesterday, every element of 
their sappy, Cinderella-like 
playoff run had remained 
intact. 

They were the classic 
underdog: the mythical David, 
if you will. They were a ragtag 
assembly of scrappy upstarts 
who compensate for their lack 
of ability with sheer will and

ROLUNG AGAIN: The UCSD women's hoopsters found its shoot-
ing stroke and inside game in a big win against Occidental on Friday

We're coming down to crunch time in the 
women 's hoops season, and the question that 
looms large is: Which Triton team will show up

on a given evening? 
For the first few weeks of 

the season, UCSD showed its 
opponents the doors of the 
Main Gym almost as soon as 
they arrived. Recently, how-
ever, the Tritons have 
struggled with their shooting 
and rebounding, and they have 
found themselves los'ing 
games they should have been 
winning. 

On Friday night, the Tritons returned to the 

form they had displayed earlier in the season. They 
got back on track in a big way, slapping Occiden-
tal College with an 82-65 defeat. 

"We played a good game," Triton Head Coach 
Judy Malone said. "[Occidental has] been playing 
tough against everybody, and I was pleased to beat 
them by that much." 

UCSD got ~ut to a fast start, launching itself to 
a 10-5 lead within the first five minutes of the 
game, when Janessa Bayda converted a layup off 
a nifty dish from Marcia Jeffries. 

Occidental clawed back to within a point at 18-
17, but UCSD didn't let up. The Triton pressure 
defense forced numerous turnovers to help build a 
to-point run that boosted UCSD to a 28-17 cush-
ion. 

After a brief respite, the Triton offense turned
