RE INDIE ROMCOMS AND FISTS

After tabling the 2010-11 executive budget last week, A.S. Council passed a new version that redi-rected $22,000 toward the Sun 
God Festival budget and funded $4,500 the 
Black Student Union’s Kwanzaa dinner. 

A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine first 
sent out a draft of the new executive budget 
to the council listserv on Tuesday, Oct. 19. 
The next morning, Oct. 20, Vice President 
of Student Life and Warren Senator Maclen 
Zilber debuted an alternative budget that 
they had created, together with Sixth College 
Senator Parminder Sandhu. 

In her official budget, Ben Hassine had 
asked each of the three offices — Office of the 
President, Student Life and External Affairs — 
to take an across-the-board 8-percent cut. The 
allocation of the cuts was to be decided by the 

vice president in charge of each section. 
According to Sandhu, major differences 

in the two budgets are that the alternative 
version does not cut equally from the differ-
ent sectors, but instead preserves the funding 
of the Office of Student Life —  specifically 

funding for student organiza-
tions and events such as Bear 
Garden and Sun God Festival 
—   and removes the senators’ 
$10 weekly stipend. 

Bear Gardens, Sandhu said 
have the highest turnout of 

any A.S.-sponsored event after Sun God, 
and are indicative of the types of events that 
most benefits students. 

In addition, the alternative budget asks 
for cuts to council development money and 
the complete removal of the speaker series.

According to Ben Hassine’s budget, 
approximately $22,000 was cut from the Sun 
God Festival budget, leading to an allocation 
of $508,000, compared to last year’s budget 
of $550,000.

“This [alternative budget] preserves the 
spirit of what the students want,” Zilber said. 
“Students who voted for an activity fee refer-
endum two years ago said they wanted more 
concerts and more events, and we want to 
try to allocate more to this department to 
reserve the intent of the referendum.”

Zilber, Sandhu and Pham had worked on 
this budget since Tuesday night, but had not 
consulted Ben Hassine. 

“We did not consult Wafa because we felt 
the differences were too irreconcilable and 

BUDGET, REVISITED

With leadership training taking a hit, but Sun God Festival funding intact, the 
third version of this year’s budget passes after only 5 hours. By Angela Chen

The UC campuses joined together this year 
to debut a system-wide student health insurance 
plan specifically for graduate students, called 
UC-GSHIP. According to Director of Health 
Services Regina Fleming, graduate students are 
more likely to need coverage for issues like giving 
birth, so the graduate student premium is sepa-
rate and twice the amount of the undergraduate 
Student Health Insurance Policy plan. Graduate 
student plans cost $548 per quarter, compared to 
$290 for undergraduates.

In the past, the graduate health insurance 
programs varied with each campus. In this new 
system, the University of California self-insures 
the graduate plan. This means that the univer-
sity holds the money collected from students to 
pay out claims and uses Anthem Blue Cross as a 
third-party health insurance provider.

Fleming said UC officials chose Anthem Blue 
Cross as a service provider because of its exten-
sive network of providers and hospitals, called 
Prudent Buyer Providers, who agreed to charge 
lower fees to Anthem Blue Cross patients.

She said this plan is designed to cut out the 
middleman — such as insurance brokers used 
in the original campus-specific system — and is 
expected to provide the UC campuses with more 
available money to directly spend. Brokers take 
a premium for their job of looking for insur-
ance companies and providing customer service. 
When a broker is not used and the entity — such 
as the UC system — funds its own insurance 
plan, this saves the money usually used to pay a 
broker’s commission. 

Currently, roughly 73 percent of UC graduate 
students are insured under the UC-GSHIP, com-
pared to 60 percent of undergraduate students 
who are enrolled in the undergraduate program

UC System Enrolls Record-Breaking 
Number of Low-Income Students
By Jerry To
Staff Writer

This year, the University of California 
has enrolled the largest number of low-
income students in its 142-year history. 

Throughout the 10 campuses system-
wide, an estimated 39 percent of newly 
enrolled undergraduates come from low-
income families, which is an 8-percent 
increase from the 2008-09 year, and the larg-
est percentage of low-income students since 
the university’s establishment. 

To be considered a low-income student, 
parental income must be below $32,800, 

while medium-low income ranges from 
$32,801 to $65,600. According to Admissions 
Director Mae Brown, the Fall 2010 freshman 
class makes up the largest percentage of low-
income students over the past 5 years. Out 
of a total of 3,947 new freshmen, 2,560 are 
low-income. Out of 6,507 new students, a 
total of 2,920 come from low and medium-
low income backgrounds. 

In addition, 1355 (or 34.3 percent) of 
new freshmen and 781 (or 30.5 percent) of 
new transfer students are first-generation 
college students.

StudyÊLinksÊAlcoholÊConsumptionÊToÊCauseÊof ÊSIDS

SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Miguel Guevara
Contributing Writer

Though Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome has long been perceived 
as the death of a child without any 
explainable cause of health, a study led 
by sociology professor David Phillips 
points to the caretakers’ alcohol con-
sumption as a possible cause. 

The cause of SIDS is officially 
unknown, though it has been linked 
to teen mothers, mothers who use 
drugs, premature babies, no prenatal 
care and situations of poverty. SIDS 
rates have dropped dramatically since 
1992 — when parents were told to 
put babies to sleep on their backs 
or sides to reduce the likelihood of 
SIDS — but remain as a significant 
cause of death among infants under 
one year old.

Phillips, along with a group of 
200 undergraduate students, ana-
lyzed cause of death data from the 
death certificates of children from 
1973 to 2006. They compared this 
information with the Fatality Analysis 

Reporting System. The FARS provides 
information on all U.S. motor vehicle 
accidents, and the information on 
alcohol-related accidents helped the 
researchers to discover when alcohol 
consumption spiked most dramati-
cally. They found that the most dan-
gerous time was from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
and weekends and holidays. 

By comparing this information to 
the death certificates, the team found 
the largest spike in the reported num-
ber of SIDS deaths — 33 percent — 
occurred during the same times as 
high alcohol consumption. 

Phillips said that the alcohol con-
sumption of an infant’s caretakers 
affects her home life. For example, 
during times when a caretaker is 
drunk, he or she is less likely to place 
the infant in a safe position or moni-
tor him/her sufficiently. 

Phillips said he hopes his find-
ings — the first large-scale study to 
test the correlation between SIDS 
and alcohol — will raise aware-
ness on the importance of respon-
sible caretakers. He said he believes 

more information about the disease 
should be given to everyone that will 
be taking care of an infant.

He said that still there is 
much more research to be done 
on SIDS, including looking at the 
police records, finding correlations 
between the income of fathers and 
the number of cases or the condi-
tions of the dead.

Phillips’s paper on SIDS will be 
published in the science journal 
Addiction.

showing results,” Brown said. “New 
enrollment is carefully managed 
to enable campuses to reach their 
enrollment targets with greater pre-
cision while still offering a space 
to as many deserving students as 
possible.”

There has also been a total 
779-person increase in underrep-
resented freshmen from last year. 
This includes 36-percent increase 
in African-American freshmen, 
4.3-percent increase in Mexican 
Americans, 7.7-percent increase in 
Latinos and 84.6-percent increase in 
Native Americans.  

Among transfers, there is an 
89.1-percent African-American 
increase, 43.1-increase in Mexican 
Americans, 52.3 increase in Latinos 
and 75-percent increase in Native 
Americans.

The time is upon us… again. You know that saying, third time’s the charm? Tonight, 
A.S. Council put that to the test.      
    But before the floodgates were 
opened, public input had to happen.  
This week, a very emotional Black 
Student Union dominated public 
input.  David Ritcherson, Director 
of Financial Affairs of S.P.A.C.E.S. 
and former chair of the Black Student 
Union, expressed 
disappointment 
and anger toward 
the council’s deci-
sion to not fund 
BSU’s annual 
Kwanzaa as a 
tradition event.  
BSU members were outraged by the 
absence of VP of Finance Andrew 
Ang due to a midterm, and criticized 
him for lack of communication. 

The BSU members argued that 
Kwanzaa is second only to Sun God 
as the biggest tradition that takes 
place at UCSD.  Various council-
members argued in favor of funding 
the event despite the lack of protocol 
followed. VP of Student Life Kristina 
Pham stated that not funding 
Kwanzaa would prove detrimental to 
the university as a whole and suggest-
ing revisiting the funding guidelines.

Council decided to fund Kwanzaa 
as a tradition event by pulling funds 
from their administration and overal-
location budgets. 

Budget talks finally arrived.  Even 
the projector appeared wary of what 
was coming, as it decided to not 
cooperate with projecting the dread-
ed document.  

And it began, with considering 
the nearly five-page budget line by 
line.  As councilmembers debated 
various items, A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine paused to point that 
she was noticing the gradual de-pri-

oritization of A.S. Council offices 
and the prioritization of the Student 
Life Office, which revolved around 
Concerts and Events.  A.S. Concerts 
and Events was criticized for ask-
ing for more money for its Senior 
Sendoff Bear Garden. Multiple coun-
cilmembers noted the issue of budget 
cuts as well as the financial problems 
that many students are facing at our 
university.    

With a heated 
argument and 
numerous coun-
cilmembers vis-
ibly upset, the Sun 
God line item bud-
get was increased 
from $508,340 to 

around $530,000.  
Council’s vote to fund BSU after 

repeatedly insisting that its violated 
protocol in the funding process only 
led to Finance Chief of Staff Lynne 
Swerhone to call for the funding of 
Muir Musical, which also lost tradi-
tion funding due to problems with 
protocol.  

This brought a backlash, with 
councilmembers insisting that there 
was no money left in the piggy bank 
that is the council budget to provide 
another exception.  

The repeated back and forth 
among members eventually led to 
an outburst by SAAC Representative 
Grant White, who took time to 
“point out the big white elephant in 
the room” and accuse A.S. Council 
with breeding racism, homophobia 
and misogyny from its council meet-
ings.  He ended his outburst by 
briefly leaving the Forum.  With 
the outburst, tensions rose so high 
that a 15-minute break was called 
for. Would the ice melt in those 15 
minutes?  I wouldn’t find out, as I 
took my leave from this exhausting 
journey.

NewÊHealthÊCareÊPolicyÊTreatsÊPre-ExistingÊConditions
SHIP.

“By joining the graduate students 
together as a larger group, we are 
able to negotiate for lower premi-
ums and better benefits,” Fleming 
said. “Health insurance companies 
prefer to have risk spread over a 
larger number of people, and are will-
ing to provide cheaper coverage for 
larger institutions like the University 
of California that make health insur-
ance mandatory for all students.” 

In addition, the Student Help 
Insurance Policy, influenced by new 
provisions from President Barack 
Obama’s health care reform bill, now 

covers pre-existing medical condi-
tions.

“Under our old policy, if a student 
previously uninsured with a pre-exist-
ing condition signed up for SHIP, he or 
she wouldn’t be able to get coverage for 
that condition for the first six months,” 
Fleming said. “Since the healthcare 
reform bill went into effect, though, we 
no longer deny coverage for any pre-
existing conditions.”

SHIP also now treats men-
tal health conditions and physical 
health conditions equally, meaning 
that there is no longer a limit on the 
number of visits students can get for 
psychological conditions; under the 

old policy, patients had a maximum 
of one visit per day, and only up to 
26 per plan year. Starting next year, 
SHIP will also put an end to limits on 
policy coverage.

Fleming is unsure how the new 
benefits will affect premium costs, 
though the current costs are the same 
as last year. 

“These provisions are going to 
take a lot of pressure off people who 
are in need of healthcare and can’t 
afford it,” Warren College junior 
Aaron Speer said.

would lead to unnecessary confronta-
tion,” Sandhu said. 

Ben Hassine said that the creation 
of the alternative budget was detri-
mental to the council’s effectiveness. 

“[A.S. Concerts and Events] is pre-
served more than anything, and every-
thing else is shafted,” Ben Hassine said. 
“Kristina thinks that student life is the 
most important, but A.S. isn’t just here 
to throw one big party.”

Ben Hassine said that the alterna-
tive budget contains incorrect infor-
mation, such as overallocating ben-
efits to the graphic artist salaries. 

 “The reason I chose across-the-
board 8-percent budget cuts was to 
ensure that we don’t take a giant 
amount from any one department 
or eradicate,” she said. “Student Life 
is least affected. Yes, Sun God had 
$20,000 taken away from it, but at 
most that would mean just one less 
tent. Not even.”

She added that she was disap-
pointed that an alternative budget 
had been drafted without her input. 

“This undermines the integrity 
of A.S. Council, and I’m telling you 

that as A.S. President,” she said. “It 
shouldn’t happen and if it continues 
nobody will need to take us seri-
ously.”

During the budget meeting, the 
council voted to take $1,000 out of 
leadership training to be put toward 
the Office of Student Life. 

“We are going to weaken a lot of 
the branches of the associates stu-
dents, and we’re only going to be 
here for concerts and that’s not the 
purpose of A.S.,” Ben Hassine said. 
“I love concerts, I love Sun God, but 
at the same time this is $1,000 out of 
leadership and development.”

Other changes included a request 
for an additional $12,000 for the Senior 
Sendoff Bear Garden, which failed. 

“I feel the situation we are in is like 
ancient Rome, where we are failing 
and we pour more money into enter-
tainment when there are more serious 
issues,” Associate Vice President of 
Local Affairs Matthew Vu said. “We’re 
allowing students to feel happy so that 
they have all this event, but $12,000 is 
a lot of money that could go toward 
student issues, like our right to educa-
tion, and yet these things are being 

deprioritized.”
The council decided to restore the 

$22,000 taken out of Sun God Festival 
budget through money from overal-
location. 

Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
argued that since the majority of Sun 
God costs are security costs – which 
cannot be changed —  the $22,000 
would be taken directly from artist 
fees and would impact the quality of 
the headlining artist For example, last 
year’s headliner, Drake, had an artist 
fee of $75,000, which Wong said the 
council wouldn’t have been able afford 
with the cut.

Black Student Union mem-
bers also came to request funding 
for their traditional Kwanzaa event. 
Although Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Andrew Ang argued 
that they had breached protocol, the 
council agreed to fund the $4,500 for 
the BSU event. Of this, $3,000 will 
come from administrative supplies, 
and $1,000 from overallocation.

For me, Sunday mornings are made for lounging. If I’m lucky, I’m able to scrounge up enough 
ingredients to make pancakes. If not, 
it’ll be another sad bowl of milk-less 

Honey Nut Cheerios. 
If I’m feeling particularly produc-

tive, I’ll catch up with “Castle.” If 
not, it’s back to bed for a few more 
hours. I like my Sunday mornings. 
Unfortunately, my mother doesn’t 
share the same sentiment. 

In an effort to make me find more 
meaning in my life (apparently Family 
Feud on Facebook doesn’t count), she 
made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. 
In exchange for spending precious 
Sunday morning hours on something 
other than myself, she offered to pay 
for my gas. As a college student, I’ll 
take any handout I can get. 

Turns out, those couple of hours 
wouldn’t be spent cleaning the beach, 
or any other humanitarian options 
that would fit on my resume. Instead, 
I would be driving an hour to Chula 
Vista for a church service. That’s right, 
you heard me: Church.

 Back in the day — when AOL was 
the Internet provider of choice — my 
family went to church. But then soccer 
practices and public speaking tourna-
ments happened. 

Since then, in one of my mother’s 
vain attempts to drag me back to 
church, I was lucky enough to witness 
a mother telling her 6-year-old son 
that he couldn’t be a Power Ranger 
for Halloween. Apparently, it was the 
devil’s holiday and if he celebrated it he 
would go to Hell. Absurd.

After pulling into the New Hope 
Church parking lot, once they dis-
covered I was new, they greeted me 
with pamphlets and brochures. The 
next person that stopped me thought I 
looked familiar, and I politely told him 
that was impossible. 

“Oh my gosh, you’re Laureen’s 
daughter!”

Guilty. 
Now I knew why my mother 

wanted me to drive to the border for 
church: She was BFFs with the pastor. 

Inside, I did a quick once-over in 
search of a strategic seat. Feeling like 
the delinquent student who sits in the 
back row and creeps on Facebook, tell-
ing everyone who’ll listen that “Damn, 
this class is dull,” I chose a seat close to 
the door for a quick exit. Just in case. 

As I looked around, I was aston-
ished at how diverse the attendees 
were. Young and old, dressed in their 
Sunday best and destroyed jeans, every 
possible demographic was represented. 

Call me cliché, or even a sellout, 
but as I sat there listening to Christian 
rock and how it’s okay to make mis-
takes, I felt good. I felt refreshed. I felt 
spiritual. I felt like there was some 
greater being looking out for me. Dare 
I say, I even enjoyed it. 

Instead of preaching why swear-
ing meant St. Peter wasn’t about to 
let me in anytime soon, Pastor Russ 
talked about money. In 45 minutes, he 
summed up why I’m always strapped 
for cash, and offered a God-infused 
lesson on how to fix my bank account.

Driving back to La Jolla, I thought, 
“Well, that wasn’t so bad.” The life 
lessons made sacrificing sleep more 
than worth it. And unlike my attempts 
at veganism, I think I’ll actually look 
forward to driving back to New Hope 
next Sunday. Just don’t tell my mom 
that she was right (this time).

A Change of 
Pace

By Wafa Ben Hassine
President, ASUCSD 

I want to take this opportunity 
that The Guardian has graciously 
given me to apologize to you, the 
student. Despite our best efforts, 
the Associated Students student 
government is failing to achieve its 
mission and purpose.

The UC San Diego Associated 
Students budget now deals with 
8-percent monetary cuts due to 
many reasons. One of these rea-
sons can be attributed to the UC 
Regents’ collective decision to 
decrease enrollment at all campus-
es, with the exception of “flagship” 
campuses UC Berkeley and UCLA. 
In light of the current situation, 
the A.S. Council has struggled to 
address the budget shortfalls in a 
serious and responsible way.

In deciding to increase funding 
for on-campus concerts this year by 

$22,000 (in addition to the already 
allocated $802,349), council mem-
bers have chosen to slash funding 
for key programs, such as college 
council mixers and leadership out-
reach programs on campus. The 
same council members though, had 
no idea where such an exorbitant 
sum of $22,000 would come from. 
Despite their good intentions, some 
councilmembers seem to have a 
severe and deleterious misplace-
ment of priorities — one that has 
lead to much emphasis on trivial, 
short-lived entertainment events 
rather than long-term programs 
that benefit all students. These 
members’ decisions — albeit seem-
ingly full of good intention — held 
just about as much water as the 
notion of UCSD funding a football 
team and reek of fiscal irresponsi-
bility in a time of financial hard-
ship.

While issues of diversity, access 

and affordability to our university 
may be a far-removed thought for 
a small minority of very privileged 
students on this campus, for the 
large majority of us, we confront 
these issues on a daily basis. 
Students like Albert Lin, a biochem 
major who works two part-time 
jobs and whose parents both work 
the graveyard shift as mail handlers 
at the Long Beach Processing & 
Distribution Center Postal Plant in 
order to support his college educa-
tion, face the very real prospect of 
not being able to afford next quar-
ter’s student fees.

The decisions of the UC 
Regents, the state legislature, and in 
particular California’s current gov-
ernor (remember to vote this Nov. 
2!) have been disastrous to our 
public education system and to our 
own financial futures. Fortunately, 
the Associated Students is a body 
that is composed of students that 

work for all students as elected 
representatives. We can affect these 
state budgetary issues in a very 
direct manner and raise aware-
ness about said issues among the 
student body — right here and 
right now. And for this reason, 
I have tremendous hope in A.S. 
Counciland continue to do so, 
despite the feelings of doubt at 
times. I do believe in all that we 
can achieve as a diverse, yet uni-
fied, student body.

We have failed you last night, 
fellow Tritons. I assure you, how-
ever, that I give it my all to re-
prioritize our collective focus. I 
know that my office will continue 
to work for students on these issues 
and continue to advocate on their 
behalf, prioritizing the very real 
and tangible issues of access and 
affordability that affect us through-
out our daily actions and lives.

Let’s keep moving forward.

Come on, A.S. Council, it’s too early for this. It’s midterms season, we know, and everyone’s stressed, but if yesterday’s political showdown is any indication 
you’re going to be shrieking battle cries come finals.

After last week’s budget S.N.A.F.U. was shelved the second 
it hit council floor, A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine has been 
working overtime to make something that stands up against 
your basic number crunching. But while she’s been tinkering 
with decimals and chatting to administrators, other council-
members had different ideas.

It’s not these ideas — which included cutting senatorial 
stipends in place of Sun God Festival funding — that cast an 
ominous shadow on the future of this council, but rather the 
way they were dealt with. Instead of taking these concerns 
straight to the president herself, these delegates cited “irrecon-
cilable differences” and made their own budget.

Though the alternative budget is only there as a showcase 
of how different things could be, its mere existence spells disas-
ter for a divided council further down the road — a council 
with clashing priorities and back-room deals.

Instead of Ben Hassine’s current brainchild — which 
spreads an 8-percent budget cut evenly across the Offices of 
the President, Student Life and External Affairs, giving the 
heads of those departments discretion to distribute as they 
see fit — this budget claims the superiority of being based on 
student surveys. These surveys, taken when students passed 
an activity fee increase in Spring 2009, indicated that students 
wanted to see more events like Sun God Festival or Bear 
Gardens.

Based on these results, the alternative budget preserves 
funding for the Office of Student Life (and therefore A.S. 
Concerts and Events), leaving our beloved Sun God Festival 
intact at the expense of staff development, travel expenses and 
senator stipends.

Don’t get us wrong, there’s parts of this that we love. Senators 
willing to take the money out of their own pockets in the name 
of preserving student life should not be taken lightly. For all A.S. 
Council’s talk of “gauging student opinion,” it’s rare that council-
members look at student surveys that can even pretend to be a 
halfway accurate gauge of what the student body wants. Doing 
that, and then trying to reflect those results in the council’s bud-
get, is itself a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

But the fact remains that A.S. Council isn’t here, as Ben 
Hassine herself said, to make UCSD “one big party.” If all of our 
students were here for a year-long rager, it would already be

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I am writing in regards to the 

article (regarding the A.S. budget) in 
the Oct. 18 issue of The Guardian.  
Upon reading the article, I was 
surprised to see that A.S. council 
members seem to be forgetting 
what their positions are and what 
responsibilities each one of them 
must own up to.  In the article, the 
A.S. President was bashed for the 
mistakes made in the budget for 
this year.  As far as any student is 
concerned, it seems that it should 
have been the VP of Finance’s job 
to make sure that the budget was in 
order.  The A.S. President should be 
advised by Andrew Ang, the VP of 
Finance on issues like this, not the 
other way around. So why wasn’t he 
owning up to the mistakes he made 
in the budget?  It seems that Andrew 
Ang is not capable of the position 
he fills and would rather shirk his 
duties when the going gets tough. It 
is alarming that another member of 
the Council, Warren College Senator 
Maclen Zilber, had to point out the 
budget discrepancies. As a student, I 
only see one solution here: impeach 
Andrew Ang for gross and deliber-
ate incompetence, and have none 
other than Mr. Zilber, who seems 
much more qualified and knowl-
edgeable, fill his position.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Editor,
I recently read the Oct. 18 issue 

of The Guardian, and while I am not 
completely informed on the inner 
workings of A.S., I consider myself 
to be a conscious student who tries 
to pay attention to what the leaders 
on this campus are doing — specifi-

cally the leaders I voted into office.
I have to say that I disagree with 

the way the A.S. President Wafa Ben 
Hassine was portrayed in regards to 
the miscalculation of the budget. It 
appeared that all of the blame was 
put on the President and not the VP 
of Finance and Resources, who, if 
I am not mistaken, is in charge of 
doing the calculations and advising 
the President about said calculations 
in order to formulate an accurate 
budget. How is it that the VP of 
Finance, whose duty it is to be work-
ing on the budget, was so mathemat-
ically inept that he miscalculated an 
error so large that the subsequent 
result was a tabled budget? I myself 
am concerned for our student body 
if a student in such a position cannot 
handle the responsibilities his fellow 
students elected him to execute. 

While the A.S. President is 
responsible for presenting the bud-
get and working with the VP of 
Finance to do so, it is important to 
point out that neither of the two 
caught the mistakes mentioned. 
Instead, another senator had to pick 
up the slack for Ang. The article 
printed seemed to be all about how 
the VP of Finance had nothing to 
do with the budget when “finance 
and “resources” is in his title! The 
fact that the VP of Finance blamed 
the President for the miscalculations 
and discrepancies within the budget 
is in indicator that Ang is a coward 
who fails to take fault for his poor 
judgement and poor mathematical 
abilities. If I recall correctly, this is 
not the first time that the press has 
addressed his faults publicly. My 
advice for our VP of Finance: if you 
can’t stand the heat and you can’t 
cook, get out of the kitchen. Or in 
this case: out of the Office of VP of 
Finance and Resources and back to 
Math 10A.

one big party with or without A.S. 
Council’s help.

There are kids who come to every 
Bear Garden and see Sun God Festival 
as the highlight of their year — the 
Final’s Week undie run is an almost 
religious occurrence for them. On the 
flip side, there are kids who still aren’t 
sure what a Bear Garden is, and who 
take the evening of Sun God as their 
cue to switch from Geisel Library to  
CLICS (less chance of your study ses-
sion being invaded by giddily intoxi-
cated festivalgoers). 

A.S. Council may be elected by 
only the vocal, party-loving students 
who want to see more money fun-
neled into snagging the best artists, 
but it needs to represent everyone — 
even those who put poli-sci papers 

first. Downplaying the importance of 
concerts and events does nothing for 
our student life, of course, but sending 
the message that the other stuff doesn’t 
matter is just as inaccurate.

Priorities aside, there’s the mat-
ter of a divided council to consider. 
Not being able to pull together on 
something like an A.S. budget indi-
cates trouble ahead — just as soon as 
another divestment resolution comes 
around, or when media guidelines 
revisit the spotlight. Last time an issue 
that controversial raised its ugly head, 
it gridlocked the council for days, 
where bitter arguments and “irrecon-
cilable differences” played their parts 
in making sure nothing got done. 
The fear isn’t so much that issues like 
those will now get worse (because it’s 
hard to get worse than three weeks 

of dragged-out bickering) but that 
the smallest issues will devolve into 
Palestine-worthy brawl.

It’s the fourth week and there are 
already “irreconcilable differences.” 
Problems this early in the quarter do 
not bode well for the future; if people 
get embroiled in inter-council politics, 
sooner or later the reason they wanted 
to be there in the first place is going to 
fall by the wayside.

Regardless of whether Ben Hassine 
is everyone’s favorite person, she’s the 
democratically elected leader. She is 
going to be sitting at the head of the 
table for the rest of the year. If council-
embers can’t figure out how to at least 
look her in the eyes when they’ve got a 
problem with how she’s doing things, 
this is going to get real uncomfortable 
real quickly. For all of us.

TONIGHT

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7

Please, Leave 
Yeezy Alone!
Damn you, Taylor Swift. Damn you for making effortlessly catchy pop that somehow appeals to 
my female sensibilities.  Damn you for 
being so pretty. And most importantly, 
damn you for making Kanye West look like 
such a jerk. 

Kanye has always been an arrogant bas-
tard, but for some unholy reason, it wasn’t 
beefs with 50 Cent that did him in. Instead, 
ruining the moment of a 19-year-old mil-
lionaire was the deal breaker, unloading a 
mountain of scorn onto the back of one sad, 
drunk fool. 

It’s been a year since the inception of 
those “Imma let you finish” jokes, and to 
mark the anniversary at the MTV Video 
Music Awards this September  — amidst 
spliced-up footage of the now infamous 
disaster — Swift decided to get patronizing, 
asserting via an out-of-tune shitfest that 
Kanye West is “still an innocent.” 

Well, duh. 
Innocent? You don’t need to remind 

me, Taylor — Kanye’s a saint in my eyes. 
He may be a jackass that our entire nation 
boos, but he’s also a jackass that our nation 
pays money to listen to. Despite garner-
ing disdain even from our own president, 
Kanye is the most influential rapper of our 
generation, and he better get his recognition 
for it. Sure, he may be prone to foot-in-
mouth syndrome, but Kanye’s talent always 
seems to outshine his idiocy. 

Like now: After hiding from the media 
for more than half a year since the Swift 
debacle, Kanye has finally stepped back into 
the spotlight — starting the world’s funniest 
Twitter, killing it on SNL and releasing a 
stream of free singles through his website’s 
G.O.O.D. Friday initiative. 

Throw in two impeccable singles — 
the piano-laced, douchebag sing-a-long 
“Runaway” and the King Crimson-
sampling “Power” — and it’s hard to deny 
Yeezy’s ear for innovative hip hop. I, for one, 
couldn’t be happier that the self-declared 
king of the game is back on his (likely 
Prada) throne. 

My love for Kanye goes way back. The 
first time I heard him was when I saw the 
“All Falls Down” music video on “TRL.” I 
was in middle school and had begun my 
affair with hip hop, convincing my parents 
to buy me unedited versions of Nellyville 
and The Eminem Show. 

There was also the premiere for “Jesus 
Walks.” The bombastic track, with its puls-
ing drums and gospel wails, blew my mind 
so much it almost made me want to go to 
church — a startling thought, considering 
I’m freakin’ Jewish. 

I didn’t realize it then, but Kanye was 
fascinating to me because he was so differ-
ent. He didn’t fit into the obvious niches. He 
wasn’t just West Coast or East Coast, black 
or white. He appealed to everyone. He was 
a dude who wrote personal songs — a rarity 
with rappers — with a flair for chipmunk 
R&B samples and designer fashion.  

Since then, Kanye has reinvented his 
sound with nearly every album. There’s the 
trifecta of university albums: The College 
Dropout showcased his soulful produc-
tion style, Late Registration was a boom-
ing hodgepodge of musical genres, and 
Graduation brought electronica to hip-hop 
(a trend that’s still going strong. “Like a G6,” 
anyone?). 

The thread that ties these three albums 
together is Kanye’s wordplay (“They say I 
was the abomination of Obama’s nation/ 
Well, that’s a pretty bad way to start the 
conversation,” he spits on “Power”). Unlike, 
say, Eminem, it isn’t a rapping marathon: 
Kanye’s style has an easy singsong flow.

“air doll”
saturday, oct. 23, 8:50 P.M. 
WedNesday oct. 27, 8:45 P.M. 
What would happen if Lars’ “real girl” had actu-
ally been a real girl? So asks the Japanese selec-
tion “Air Doll,” which follows the journey of a 
sex doll that “wakes up” one day with a heart. 
The film — originally a manga series — marks a 
return to director Hirokazu Koreeda’s signature 
style of magical realism. It plays out like a mod-
ern fairy tale: Once the eponymous doll comes to 
life, she leaves her master (still dressed in her sexy 
nurse costume) and explores the outside world, 
eventually meeting (and falling in love with) an 
employee at a video store. Absent is the quirky 
yet realistic humor of that other sex-doll dramedy 
(“Lars and the Real Girl”); “Air Doll” is instead an 
unexpectedly thought-provoking parable on the 
search for a soul. 

“leGeNd oF the Fist: the returN oF cheN ZheN”
thursday, oct. 21, 7 P.M. 
You can only expect so much from a movie titled “Legend of the Fist.” 
For this festival opener, prepare yourself for a flick that doesn’t even 
try to be an engrossing drama — instead, there’s fists, fists and more 
fists. The Hong Kong martial arts extravaganza stars Donnie Yen as 
the titular Chen Zhen, an iconic action character (think the Chinese 
James Bond) originally played by Bruce Lee in 1972. In this piece of the 
series, Chen Zhen is presumed dead and secretly living in a Japanese-
occupied Shanghai. Disguising himself as a caped fighter, Chen Zhen 
sets out to fight for Chinese resistance against the Japanese by infiltrat-
ing the mob. Yes, it sounds absolutely ridiculous, but with cutting-edge 
visual style brought to you by the film director Andrew Lau, it ain’t a 
bad way to start off the festival. Plus, this is the popcorn flick’s West 
Coast premiere.

Film Festival

N ow in its 11th year, the annual San Diego Asian Film Festival is back and bigger than ever, featuring numerous guests, educational 
workshops and over 140 features, shorts and docu-
mentaries. The festival begins today and runs until 
next Thursday, Oct. 28 at Mission Valley UltraStar

will be in attendance at the panels taking place over 
the course of the week, including Harry Shum Jr. (the 
“other Asian” on “Glee”), Ellen Wong (“Scott Pilgrim 
vs. the World”), C.S. Lee (“Dexter”), Daniel Dae Kim 
(“Lost”) and John Cho (the Harold of “Harold and 
Kumar”). But most importantly, the festival gives you 
the opportunity to check out diverse flicks by some of 
the best filmmakers from 20 countries. 



8ÊTHE UCSD GUARDIANÊ THURSDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2010Ê HIATUS

Then there’s 808s & Heartbreak; 
quite possibly the most important 
hip hop album in recent memory. 
It isn’t his most enjoyable album, 
but through it, Kanye West single-
handedly killed gangsta rap, aban-
doning samples and blazing rhymes 
for starkly empty tracks with noth-
ing but his voice, tribal drums and 
auto-tune — allowing for similarly 
emotional artists like Drake and Kid 
Cudi to blow up the charts. 

Yeezy was the right man at the 
right time. All of the ’90s gangsta 
greats were on the free-fall: Ice Cube 
was doing kid movies, Flavor Flav 
was finding love and Biggie and 
Tupac had died. What little remained 
of the genre was getting destroyed by 
the unoriginal rhymes of men like 
50 Cent.

Kanye didn’t take part in that. He 
just delivers instantly classic hip-hop. 
Sure, there are more legendary rap-
pers, like Jay-Z, but even Hova has 
to thank Kanye for the production 
of his most important album, The 
Blueprint. 

Yes, Kanye West can be a dick. 
But he’s a dick that has arguably 
more influence on the industry than 
anyone else. And when his new 
album My Beautiful Dark Twisted 
Fantasy drops on Nov. 22, be pre-
pared to witness another hip-hop 
revolution in the making.

Shakira
Sale el Sol
EPIC

S hakira may be lookin’ a little slim (what happened to those hips, baby girl?) but she’s border-hop-
ping better than ever. On her latest 
Sale el Sol, the seductress polishes her 
raw Latin sound — throwing elec-
tronica and indie-rock into the mix.

The bilingual Sale El Sol is more 
reserved than last year’s She Wolf. 
There’s less noise, fewer ragers and, 
despite signature track “Loca,” a more 
toned-down thread of crazy, creat-
ing fewer distractions from Shakira’s 
unique vocal aesthetic. The songstress 
reins in the top-40 sound peppered 
throughout She Wolf (which was 
rife with electro-disco beats and Lil 
Wayne verses) and replaces it with 
the emotional honesty and signature 
Latin flavor notably absent from the 
’09 release. It’s a refreshing step back 
to her Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 roots.  

Don’t fret about busting out 
the Spanish dictionary either. On 
rock-imbibed “Devocion” and guitar-
touting “Tu Boca,” Shakira’s crooning 
feels so culturally universal, actually 
understanding the lyrics falls by the 

wayside (“Waka Waka” is diced with 
Afrikaans, for Christ’s sake).

Speaking of “Waka Waka,” if you 
haven’t had your fill of the world cup 
smash, now is your chance to have 
the anthem two ways: in Spanish and 
English, both with a new rock-techno 
backbeat under Shakira’s warbling. 

“Loca” is also available in two 
languages, both featuring a breathy 
Shakira backed by tribal drums 
and joyous trumpets that celebrate 
the singer’s resignation to insan-
ity. Depending on the version, she’s 
joined by the lyric-spitting Dizzee 
Rascal or a smoky El Cata, adding 
some masculine sex appeal. 

But for an album that lauds the 
singer’s madness, the effect is surpris-
ingly muted.  Shakira’s soulful cover 
of indie darlings The xx’s “Islands” 
— while illustrating her sincerity and 
praise-worthy tendency to experi-
ment — is oddly tame. But with that 
killer voice and the dance moves to 
match, we certainly don’t mind.

A Sunny Day In Glasgow
Autumn, Again
SELF-RELEASED

O n paper, A Sunny Day In Glasgow doesn’t sound like a very enjoyable band. Their 
music tends to eschew conventional 
song structures and instead consists 
of barely audible, vaguely connected 
melodic lines set to hazy beds of 
buzzing guitar and synthesizers. 
Meanwhile, the words are basically 
incomprehensible, and instead of  
composing songs, the band releases 
interconnected musical vignettes. 
Exhausting, right?

But despite such obstacles, the 
band manages to consistently create 
music that is artistically engaging. 
Last year’s Ashes Grammar consists 
of 22 sound sketches that develop 
lush melodies that melt away almost 
as soon as they begin. Glasgow’s 
follow-up, Autumn, Again, alters 
that formula by cleaning up their 
signature haze to reveal a more pop-
friendly sound. 

While the album’s subtitle, “Pop 
Songs 2010,” still isn’t fitting, the 
songs on Autumn actually sound like, 
well, songs. The band indulges less in 

the dreamy jamming that made them 
so intimidating, choosing to play it 
straight instead. At times, the band’s 
new approach works wonderfully  — 
both “Violet Mary Haunts Me OR 
Loss of Forgetfulness on Renfrew 
Street,” a brooding dance-pop track, 
and “Drink Drank Drunk,” an ecstat-
ic shoegaze jam, represent some of 
the most accessible, pop-friendly 
music that A Sunny Day In Glasgow 
has ever released.

The amount of conventional 
songs on Autumn, Again will come 
as a surprise to listeners familiar with 
the band’s previous releases. Though 
the change is often pleasant, the 
band’s increasing preference towards 
pop structures comes at a definite 
cost. Part of what made the band so 
alluring in the past was the ephem-
eral, collage-like nature of their 
music. Though these new tracks are 
good — sometimes great — the band 
is sacrificing what made them so 
appealing in the first place.

ALBUMREVIEW

A fter a string of critically lauded albums, a couple of tunes on the “Juno” soundtrack and a 
4-year break, Belle and Sebastian 
have had a surprising transforma-
tion: What was once a hip band is 
now kind of … lame. 

Okay, lame is a strong word. But 
on their new EP Write About Love, 
the acclaimed Glasgow seven piece 
is certainly losing their cool.

The band is known for their 
brand of wistful indie-pop, epito-
mized on their definitive work, 
2003’s Dear Catastrophe Waitress. 
But now Belle and Sebastian don’t 
seem fully committed to the tunes 
that made them famous. 

It starts out promising: Opener 
“I Didn’t See It Coming” begins 
with a rollicking drum line hastily 
accompanied by Stevie Jackson’s soft 
croon — a surprising note, consid-
ering the band’s foundation is with 
lead singer Stuart Murdoch. The 
song then collapses into an unchar-
acteristically distorted breakdown, 
finally succumbing to some ener-
getic synthesizers. It’s only until that 
odd outburst that Murdoch’s voice 
finally breaks through, and by then, 
it’s practically over. 

The rest of the intro slowly 
reminds you of the sound you’ve 
missed. “Come On Sister” and 
highlight “I Want the World to 
Start” sound like old Belle cuts, 
bringing you back to bright, famil-
iar territory. 

All goes downhill after the 
supremely lame “Little Lou, Ugly 
Jack, Prophet John,” a track that 
supplies the ultimate evidence of the 
band’s fall from hipster grace. It’s a 
collaboration with none other than 
your mother’s favorite piano-playing 
songster, Norah Jones, whose voice 
doesn’t give the track the sophistica-
tion that was intended; it just makes 
it sound adult-alternative. Let the 
VH1 crowd rejoice. 

The album picks up again with 
the ‘60s pop throwback “Write 
About Love” and the jazzy “The 
Ghost of Rockschool” — a welcome 
memento of the nostalgic songwrit-
ing these wounded introverts are 
known for.

Despite such pleasant spots, 
Write About Love simply sounds too 
cold. With the album’s forays into 
more serious territory, the band has 
lost the fuzzy reverie that gave them 
so much charm in the first place.

Friday, oct. 22, 9:30 P.M. moNday, oct. 25, 9:30 P.M.
As Leonardo DiCaprio could tell you, the final heist — that one 
last job — is always a lot more difficult than you expect, and the 
heroine of “Clash” might have to agree. “Inception”-style (minus 
that whole “dreams” thing), the thriller follows thief and seductress 
Trinh (Ngo Thanh Van) as she goes through her final job in order 
to get her kidnapped daughter back. But with a brand new crew 
that can’t be trusted, the obstacles (read: explosions) are inevitable. 
Directed by Le Thanh Son from a screenplay by martial arts heavy-
weight Johnny Nguyen, one of the film’s stars, the movie sets itself 
up as a gritty and stylish martial arts thriller. Expect the fast paced 
editing, fight scenes and car chases of your standard Hollywood 
action flick; amidst the documentaries, short films and arty indie 
comedies that dominate the festival, it will be a welcome breather.

For the indie darlings: Sit up and pay attention, because 
“Colin Hearts Kay” is essentially “500 Days of Summer.” 
Okay, there are a few changes — it’s in Brooklyn instead of 
Los Angeles, Zooey Deschanel’s Summer has been replaced 
with Chinese food blogger Kay (Emily Chang) and there’s 
none of the ultra-fine Joseph Gordon-Levitt. But the rest of 
the ingredients are still present. There’s still the post-breakup 
turmoil courtesy of the film’s protagonist Colin (Noah Starr). 
There’s still the ultra-hip soundtrack (this one features 
up-and-coming Brooklyn bands). There’s still the chronic 
whimsy, as Colin rehashes his three-year relationship’s ups 
and downs through clever drawings that turn into animated 
backgrounds. Exceedingly quirky? Yes. Entertaining? Emmy-
winning director Sebastian Ho Conley sure hopes so.

For festival closer “Au Revoir Taipei,” first-time fea-
ture director Arvin Chen promises a smile-worthy 
crowd pleaser. Setting itself up as the Taiwanese 
“Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” the film takes 
place over one memorable night in Taipei. It begins 
with the lovelorn Kai (Jack Yao) dwelling over his 
girlfriend’s move to France (where she doesn’t seem 
interested in returning his calls). He spends his day 
pining in his local bookstore, trying to teach himself 
how to speak his lover’s new language. Kai eventu-
ally embarks on an adventure — mob recruitment, 
hoodlums and all — with cute bookstore stock-girl 
Susie (Amber Kuo) through the lovingly shot streets 
of Taipei. Sure, the “Nick and Norah” setup seems 
charming enough, but if they’ve got a Thai Michael 
Cera on their hands, count us out; Hollywood’s 
already got enough of charmingly awkward dorks.

Every year, UCSD graduates choose the PharmDProgram at the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy. In fact, nearly 20 percent of our
PharmD enrollment is comprised of alumni from

California universities. 

What accounts for Michigan’s popularity among

Golden Staters? First, we are consistently ranked among

America’s top pharmacy schools. Secondly, we consider 

a lot more than GPA and PCAT scores when evaluating

your application.

Earn your bachelor’s degree at UCSD, and then earn

your PharmD at U-M. That’s what many UCSD students

do every year.

To learn more about the PharmD Program at

Michigan, visit our Web site at www.umich.edu/~pharmacy.

Or contact the College of Pharmacy at 734-764-7312

(mich.pharm.admissions@umich.edu).

Your future never looked brighter.

Meet some alumni of
California universities
who recently enrolled
as University of
Michigan PharmD 
students.

Unimportant. 

I hated football. Baseball and bas-
ketball I loved, but for two years foot-
ball was almost unbearable. I did my 
duty — playing hard and fast, throwing 
the ball to X’s and Z’s, being the scout 
team offense for the next game — but 
I hated it with a passion. I didn’t have 
the mentality, or the drive, or the heart 
for what really makes a good athlete.

That is, until the basketball game it 
all finally clicked, and I got it. It wasn’t 
a slow, gradual process of becoming 
ready to give someone else a beating; 
it was a click, a pull, an explosion of 
chain of reactions that sent me into 
overdrive. 

Surprisingly, it wasn’t a football 
game that changed me, but instead a 
basketball game. It was late in the sec-
ond quarter and the game was close. 
The man guarding me was fouling me 
all game and I took it, as the second 
foul is usually the one that gets called. 
I was calm, composed and playing all 
right. And then it happened. 

As I brought the ball up the court, 
they pressed and trapped me in the 
corner. After fouling me the whole 
game, my man closed his fist and 
punched me in the face on his way to 
taking the ball. The ref didn’t call the 
foul, and I lost it. I ran after the guy 
who was breaking away for a lay up 

and just flat out tackled him, at which 
point both teams rushed the court and 
everything became a writhing mass of 
tangled appendages.

After that, I had the attitude. Still 
calm and collected during games, I 
could flip it on at any second and go 
get that bigger play, using that little 
something extra that only getting mad 
can give you.

That is football (and to some 
extent, basketball). Our favorite stars 
are all paid millions of dollars a year to 
develop this attitude. Especially in the 
NFL, players would not last a second 
without the ability to get mad and face 
their rivals with the mindset, “I will 
end your threat to my dominance.”

In the NFL, those players are on 
another level altogether. So how can 
we be surprised when they take their 
mentality off the field? We praise them 
over and over again for kicking others 
into the dirt, so how can we expect 
them to love us for loving them, and 
then be so hurt by them when they 
reveal their animal mindset off the 
field?

The NFL players we love so much 
— a linebacker coming across the 
middle and lighting up the quarter-
back, a rover taking the head off an 
unsuspecting wide receiver — are all 
out for blood on the field. It’s like 
the Colosseum, and I love it. There is 
nothing that comes close to that feeling 
when you’re on the field and give a big 

hit, except maybe watching someone 
else do the hitting.

The players that have come into 
scandal recently should not be held to 
some higher expectations as role mod-
els for society at large, because if they 
were we would all just be fighting each 
other tooth and nail. Our love and 
money go toward conditioning them 
to be as violent as we wish we could be. 
Rather than being role models, these 
men are simply people we live vicari-
ously through. They have an outlet for 
their rage, a way to take off someone’s 
head on Monday night through the 
pads of their home team.

No one should give themselves 
over to violent tendencies in real life, 
but for those few that we have con-
ditioned to be violent for us, there 
should be a little understanding. 
Sexual assault in college bars, domes-
tic violence and dog fighting will 
not and should not ever be accept-
able, but we shouldn’t be surprised at 
Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James 
Harrison’s comments after knocking 
two Cleveland Browns players out of 
the game with concussions last week.

“I don’t want to see anyone injured,” 
Harrison said, “but I’m not opposed to 
hurting anyone. There’s a difference. 
When you’re injured, you can’t play. 
But when you’re hurt, you can shake 
it off and come back, maybe a few 
plays later or next game. I try to hurt 
people.”

TRITONS CONTINUE UNBEATEN RUN WITH 2-0 WIN OVER STANISLAUS
By Rachel Uda
Staff Writer

MEN’S SOCCER — The men’s soccer 
team closed the weekend out with a win, 
beating Cal State Stanislaus 2-0. After a 
tremendous overtime victory against No. 
14 Chico State just two days earlier, the 
Tritons carried that momentum into the 
match against a very physical Warrior 
squad. 

The Tritons got off to a strong start, 
opening the scoring in the first 15 minutes. 
In the 11th minute, senior David Bakal 
worked the ball through midfield to find 
fellow senior Shane Micheil at the edge of 
the goal box. The midfielder struck a well-
hit left-footed shot toward the far post for 
a goal.  

The Tritons increased their lead in the 
33rd minute, when 6’5” freshman forward 
Tsuk Haroush won a header between two 
defenders. Haroush flicked the ball on to 
freshman midfielder Adam Zernik, who 
collected the ball and put a hard strike into 
the net from 25 yards out.  

“[Haroush] headed a great pass to me 

and when I took my first touch, I expected 
a defender to step to me,” Zernik said, 
regarding his second goal of the season. 
“Then I realized the ball was sitting per-
fectly for me to volley it, especially given 
the slick wet field, and fortunately I struck 
with enough pace to beat the keeper to the 
far post.” 

The Tritons were able to protect their 
early 2-0 lead, but were under constant 
pressure from an aggressive Warrior attack 
that outshot the Tritons 8-3 in the second 
period. The most dangerous attempt from 
the Warriors came off a free kick awarded 
early in the second half, when a hard shot 
beat freshman goalkeeper Josh Cohen but 
careened off the crossbar. Cohen, who was 
called up to replace injured starter and fel-
low freshman Jesse Brennan, recorded five 
saves on the game and recorded his first 
career shutout.

“Sunday’s game against Stanislaus start-
ed off really well for us,” captain and senior 
defender Jared Kukura said. “We played 
a good first half and were able to end the 
half 2-0. The second half definitely wasn’t 
our best soccer, but we were still able to 

preserve the shutout and close out another 
win.”

With the pair of home victories, the 
Tritons move up in conference rankings 
to the third spot in the CCAA South 
Division. They have now notched three 
consecutive wins, and are undefeated in 
the past eight matches.  

“We moved ahead of three teams this 
past weekend to get into playoff position, 
which is great just to see in terms of results 
from our play over the last month,” Kukura 
said. “But we know that doesn’t mean any-
thing unless we finish out this weekend the 
same as we did the last. That starts with 
our game against Pomona on Friday, which 
will be a huge step towards cementing our 
playoff position.”

Zernik said the team will need to better 
its play despite Sunday’s win.

“Throughout the game, there were 
moments when we got slightly lackadaisi-
cal in our defending, but on the ball we 
were smart and always dangerous,” Zernik 
said. “In the second half, I think we started JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN FILE

Senior midfielder Shane Micheil (5) scored the opening goal of the Tritons’ 2-0 
win over Cal State Stanislaus on Oct. 17.

Football is dirty, smelly and grimy. You doggedly work grueling hours throughout 
the week, pounding through drills 
and countless minor injuries until 
everything is a natural reaction spe-
cifically to defeat the opposing play-
ers. By the end of the week, you 
respect the man you will be lining 
up against, but you are ready to rip 
his head off and throw his bloody 
body off your turf. This is the men-
tality you have to have, or you will 
lose. Plain and simple. 

Growing up in California, I had 
no idea what this mentality meant. I 
was a soft kid — athletically gifted, 
yes, but I wasn’t a killer.

Then I moved to Texas, and 
everything changed.

If you’re skeptical of the way 
Texas football is portrayed in mov-
ies, you shouldn’t be. We started at 7 
a.m., with the sun low on the hori-
zon and the dew on the turf giving 
a little cushion to my first big hit of 
which, to be clear, I was not on the 
giving end.

Kyle Binki — a junior linebacker 
with a Southern-pride attitude and 
without all four of his front teeth 
— introduced me to football as it is 
meant to be played. He absolutely 
destroyed me; helmet flying, spittle 
over my jersey, my body sunk in 
the mud by what must have been a 
good 6 inches. I made a squelching 
sound as I got up, and, years later,  
I’m still not sure if it was the mud 
or my insides. 

I got up, and got hit again. And I

WOMEN’S SOCCER WINS SIXTH STRAIGHT
By Rachel Uda
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S SOCCER —  The women’s soc-
cer team took home its sixth straight win last 
Sunday, earning a 3-0 victory against the Cal 
State Stanislaus Warriors to send the squad to 
8-2-2 in conference play and 10-2-2 overall.

This season, UCSD has outscored its oppo-
nents 31-10, with 11 out of its 17 field players 
scoring at least one goal. Offensive team play has 
been characteristic of this Triton squad, as was 
on display in Sunday’s match when three differ-
ent Tritons netted goals to obtain a decisive win 
at home.

The first goal on Sunday came 18 minutes 
into the match, when Sarah McTigue got around 
her defender inside the goal box. The junior 
forward coolly slotted the ball near-post past the 
Warrior’s goalkeeper, giving McTigue her sixth 
goal of the season, and the 17th of her career.

The Triton defense — made up of sophomore 
Ellen Wilson, sophomore Hayley Johnson and 
junior Sara Spaventa — smothered the Warriors, 
allowing CCAA top scorer Karenee Demery only 
one shot on goal for the match. The trio, who 
have worked together in the back for two seasons, 
have played a major role in the Triton success as 
of late, letting through only two goals within the 
past four conference matches.  

“With a year under their belt, the defensive 
line have gotten continually better with each 

game, and they make my job a lot easier,” goal-
keeper Kristin Armstrong said. “They work on 
both sides of the field, helping our attack and 
feeding balls to the forwards.”

The teams went into the half with the score 
1-0 in favor of the Tritons. In the 50th minute, 
junior midfielder Shelby Wong made a run down 
the left flank, managing to cross the ball into 
Annette Ilg. The grad student forward received 
the ball six yards from goal and hit a hard strike 
to put the Tritons up 2-0.

Five minutes later, the Tritons secured the win 
with another combination from Ilg and Wong. In 
the 55th minute, junior midfielder Annie Wethe 

sent a free kick toward Ilg’s head, who managed 
to flick the ball into the penalty area. Wong found 
herself unmarked on the far post and finished a 
well-hit volley to put the Tritons up 3-0.   

The Tritons controlled possession for the 
remainder of the match, denying the Warriors 
any offensive chances as Armstrong recorded her 
eighth shutout of the season.  

“I was happy that we were finally able to play 
well from start to finish,” Armstrong said. “It was 
some of the best soccer we’ve played all season. 
The possession was good, and the finishing was 
excellent.”
