UClI Clllncellor

SANTA BARBARA-
Chancellor Barbara Uehling 
may leave UCSB without a 
promised salary for paid 
administrative leave. As a 
result, some officials believe 
that she won't be leaving 
without protest. During a 
March 2 meeting with six UC 
chancellors, UC President 
Jack Peltason agreed to 
provide Uehling with an 
estimated $179,000 when she 
steps down as UCSB chancel-
lor this summer. However, 
when Peltason met with the 
Board of Regents on April 6, 
he withdrew the offer, saying 
that he may not have had the 
authority to make such a 
decision.

DISTURBANCES: Campus 
police concerned with rising 
complaints against non-affiliates 

By Erik Johnson

y*", ZOIIotOfflll/~ 

Staff Writer 
Transients roaming the campus are pro-

voking an increasing number of student com-
plaints, according to Officer Alan Jenkins of 
the UCSD Police Department. Students are 
reporting confrontational panhandling, intimi-
dation and harassment said Jenkins, adding 
that it's important for students to report these 
incidents as soon as possible. 

"No police department can handle a prob-
lem like this by itself. We just don't have the 
resources," Jenkins said. "That's why we need 
students and staff to report these incidents as 
soon as they happen, so that we can take 
action." 

According to campus Detective Nate Floyd, 
ROR-affiliated members of the public have a 
right to use university facilities, and the de-
partment is not particularly concerned with 
transients who "mind their own business." 
But according to Floyd, some of the 
university's visitors are causing problems. 

"We're not going to arrest these people 
just for panhandling, we just want to move 
them on their way. Usually we contact them 
just once or twice and they leave," Floyd said. 
However,"some [transients] have adopted 
UCSD as their home, and refuse to leave. You 
shouldn't have to be bugged on your way to 
class," he added. 

According to Jenkins, the majority of ha-
rassment victims are female, and confronta-
tions occur at all times and locations on cam-
pus. 

"I just assumed he was a student," said a 
Marshall College senior who was approached 
by a transient. "You see all kinds of weird 
people on campus and so I just figured he was 
a graduate student, but then he just flipped out 
and became really abusive." 

"It can be scary to be approached," said 
Floyd, "but don't wait until after the fact to 
report it." Floyd advises students to avoid 
engaging in conversation and to immediately 
call the police using phones in call boxes or in

UCSD Students Power 
Submarine to Gold 
UNDERWATER: UCSD engineering students team 
up with SDSU to create human-powered vessel 
By Jenn ..... Nicoli 
Staff Writer 

A team of 13 UCSD engineer-
ing students and two SDSU stu-
dents received the gold medal in 
the first-annual human-powered 
submarine race in Escondido, 
which ran March 

When asked to describe the sub-
marine, Huang said, "Imagine a bi-
cycle under water with abig capsule 
around it It's an underwater bicycle 
with a life support system." 

"[The team] began construc-
tion last August and squeezed a 

two year project 
24-29. 

The race was 
sponsored by 
Lockheed Corp. 
and the Scripps 
Institution of 
Oceanography, 
where the winning 
submarine is cur-
rently stored. The 
race and its win-
ners were recog-
nized by the Inter-
national Human 
Powered Vehicles 
A sso ciation 
(IHPVA).

months so we 
could enter the sub 
in the race," 
Huang said. The 
team was inspired 
to take on the 
projectafterwatch-
inl the national 
submarine race in 
Florida last year. 

The submarine

''This was the 
first time the race was held in San 
Diego," said Steve Huang, a 
fourth-year Warren CoJlege me-
chanical engineering major and 
one of the project's primary de-
signers. "[Submarines] raced 
against a clock, one at a time, in a 
15-feet-deep, off-shore model ba-
sin that is about the size of a foot-
balI field," Wong added. 

Approximately 15 submarines, 
sponsored by various marine-
based companies and universities 
across the country, panicipated in 
the race. However, only UCSD 
and Cal Poly Pomona entered in 
the single-occupant category. 

The prize-winning 100foot-long 
submarine, constructed of a car-
bon fiber similar to the material 
tennis rackets are made of, is a 
one-of-a-kind, one person vessel. 
Most human-powered submarines 
require two people, one to propel 
and one to navigate. 

industry donated 
approximately $15.000 and con-
struction materials to the team. 

The team hopes to improve the 
submarine so that it will eventu-
ally reach a top speed, which has 
yet to be determined. 

According to Huang, the 
vessel's fastest time so far is 3.1 
knots, but the team believes it can 
go faster. The top speed reached 
by the two-person submarine en-
try from Florida Atlantic Univer-
sity was 5.9 knots. 

The team plans to reenter the 
submarine in the Escondido race 
again next year and hopes that the 
Scripps ~quarium will keep the 
submarine on display. 

Huang sees submarine design 
projects as onloing activities for 
UCSD engineering students. 
"School is all theory, but to apply 
it is a whole different thinl. It's 
something that would interest stu-
dents and get them involved."

Criticisms of 510 Ocean 
Test Are Questionable 

Recent bad publicity bas nearly killed a program which will help 
to track global warming. The $35 million, international Acoustic 
Thennometry of Ocean Climate (ATOe) project, based·out of the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) has been inundated with 
leners claiming the program will kill whales and other marine 
mammals. 

The project will track ocean wanning by sending pulses of 195-
decibel, low-frequency sound through the ocean. In a wanner0Cea!1, 
the sound will travel faster, so the method provides a way to follow 
ocean temperatures averaged over great distances. Currently, there 
is no other way of measuring an average temperature with such 
accuracy. 

Most of the claims of A TOe opponents are either misleading or 
outright false. For instance, some suggest that SIO scientists 
admitted that the project will kill thousands of whales. But the 
scientists were required to list the maximum "take" - the greatest 
possible number of animals that could conceivably be affected in 
any way by the project, no maner how slim the chance of harm. In 
this case, "take" does not mean the project will kill thousands of 
whales. 

In addition, opponents say the sound, which is one million times 
louder than a rock concert, will disorient whales and other animals 
which rely on their hearing to navigate, feed and survive. What 
opponents forget is that noise is muted about a million times by water. 
Try shouting at someone under water and see if they can even hear 
you. AdditionaJJy, many marine biologists believe that the low-
frequency sound is too low to be heard by marine mammals at a1J. 

The final safeguard of A TOe is that SIO has given biologists the 
option of stopping the project. Marine biologists will monitor marine 
life during the pulses, and if any ill effects are noticed, they can pull 
the plug. 

Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding the project has 
become an "environmentalist-versus-scientist" battle, when actu. 
ally the project could do a world of environmental good. If more 
knowledge about the project's effects is needed, opponents should 
try to delay it so further testing can be done. Cancelling the project 
outright would be a costly mistake. 

Marijuana Sales, Use 
Should Be Legalized 

Those in favor of legalizing marijuana are often portrayed as 
unkempt hippies, usually living out of their Volkswagon buses, who 
have nothing to offer society. This and other images contribute to a 
highly irrational distortion of the issues behind legalization. It 
becomes anti-America, no-good pot-heads versus meat-eating, God. 
fearing citizens of the U.S.A. 

The fact is, no good arguments can be offered against the 
legalization of marijuana. The drug is less dangerous than alcohol, 
and smokers are less violence·prone than their boozer countapaJ1s. 
The rationalization behind making a substance illegal is based on 
the fact that it somehow does too much bum to the public. 

Clearly, pot is less dangerous than alcohol, and it is also not as 
addictive as drinking or cigarette smoking. While the cigarette 
lobby continues to claim - beyond the evidence and experience of 
any cigarene smoker - that nicotine is not addictive, many 
Americans seem to falsely assume that pot will book you if you 
smoke it. 

The criminalization of drugs has brought a war back to the stJccts 
of American cities. The same gang·related warfare was present 
during the prohibition of alcohol. In the fighting of the drug war, 
people are killed and citizens' rights are '1Jbi1rVily removed. The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, can confiacate any 
property purchased with suspeeted drug money, even wilbout proof

co.ENTAIIY: Breast cancer is one of the least taIked-about diseases in America, although it affects nearly 200,000 women each year 

SILENT DISEASE 
By HMtMr Huo ......... 
St"" Write, 

Typically ,breast cancer is DOC one 
of the main coocems on the minds of 
UCSD 1lUdents.1n fad, !nut cancer 
is probIbly one of the least tbougM. 
about subjec1I-lIIIleIIa IeIatM or 
friend is one of the 183.000Americ:ao 
women diagrned this year with this 
diaeaae. However, the threat ofbrealt 
caacer is very real toeacbof III-one 
in eight Americ:ao women will get 
breast cancer in her lifetime. This 
means that a woman is diagnoecd 
with breast cancer every tIuee min· 
utes IUd every 12 minutes a woman 
dies from the diaeaIIe. Men. too, can 
get breast cancer. Nationally 1.000 
men were diagoosect with it lISt year. 

Breast cancer bas taken a heavy 
toD 011 the American public. Over 
950,(0) U.S. women have died from 
the disease since 1960. This is twice 
the number of Americans who died in 
World Wars I and n, the Korean War. 
the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf 
War corubined. There is no cure for 
this disease and doc:ters don't know 
bow to prevent it. 

The medical community bas, how-
ever, tried to bold bade the rising tide 
of breast cancervic:tims.1t bas identi-
fied risk groUps in an effort to help 
women detect breast cancer as early as 

~. "WbiIewomenbaYethehi&b-
est iacideace of breast cancer, foI· 
Iowedby Afric:an.Amerk:an, HiIpeic 
and AIian women, " .... a r.ca sheet 
pghtiIIIed by the CaIifonIia EJected 
Women's AIIociatiOD for Educatioa 
and Reaean:b (CEWAER). We know 
that certain risk fadors, such as age 
and family history, _y indicafe a 
prediapoIitioa to this type of cancer. 
Also, resean:b conduded between 
1988 and 1990 by the CaIifomia De· 
partment of HeaItb Servias Cancer 
SurveillaDce Brancb indicates that 
breast cancer rates vary noticeably 
from county to county in CalifomiL 
For women of aU races, the 10 highest. 
incidence rates are found in Marin, 
Contra Costa, Placer, San Mateo, Or· 
ange, Sacramento, NapI. Alameda, 
Shasta and Santa Cruz counties. 

The medical community bas de· 
veloped several ways to detect mast 
cancerearly, such as the nwnmogram 
and breast exam. Mootbly breast self· 
exams and annual dinicaI breast ex· 
ams are important for women ages 
2O-4Obecauaethey havedemerbreast 
tissue. M8IIIJIlO8fIIDI are especially 
important for women over SO because 
this is the age at which chances of 
contracting the disease increase sub-
stantially. In California, African-
J\mericanwomen report significandy 

higber rates of tWng lIIIIIIJIlO8lIPy 
as a screening tool than any of the 
other three nceletbnic groups stud· 
ied. "About 80 percent of 
asymptomatic (without breast can-
cer) women age 40 and older reported 
having at Ieastone mammogram, com-
pared to about 75 percent of DOII-
Hispanic white women and 60 per-
cent of Hispanics and women of other 
racesletbnicities, " the CEW AER fad 
sbeelcontinues. H~r, these meth-
ods only help for early detection of 
cancer that a woman aIrudy has. Al-
though a woman bas a greater chance 
of surival the earlier the detection, 
there are still few options for treat-

ment. "In general, approaches to treat· 
ment have DOC cbanged dramatically 
in the pat 20 years- radiation, che-
motherapy and bormonaI therapy reo 
main the primary options," the fact 
shee. concludes. 

The incidence of breast cancer is 
rising each year. Between the ages 30 
to 34, tboIe ctiapwed with the dis-
ease bas tripled in the last 20 years. 
The incidence has quadrupled for 
women ages 35 to 39 during the same 
period. Any of us could become part 
of the growing number of breast can-
cer patients - every woman is at risk 
for breast cancer, no matter her age, 
farnily history or currenl health. And 
over 70 percent of breast cancer 0c-
curs in women who have no identifi-
able risk factors. 

Only recendy has this society done 
anything to stop breast cancer before 
it sIarts. For example, one of the rea-
som why so many women, especially 
those who are not high risk, get this 
disease is because they have been 
exposed to certain toxins and poDul-
ants: Recent studies have offered evi-
dencr, linking breast cancer to 
xenoestrogens, which are coounon 
toxic chemicals that mimic or inter-
fere with the body's natural estrogen. 
The body mistakes them for natural 
hormones and reacts to them in ways

which cause deep and permanent 
harm, which could mean breast can-
cer. These chemicals are most com· 
monIy fouDd in pesticides. They di-
rectly invade our bodies through the 
air,grouDdwaler,fruitsandvegetables, 
and indirectly through the food chain 
in our dairy and meat products. 

Despite tbeIe asaociations,the gov-
ernment and its agencies (like the 
EPA and Department of HeaIth) have 
given no legulatory attention to the 
potential impact of these chemicals or 
the carcinogenic risk from such expo-
sures. 

Few other studies have tried to 
uncover how honnonaJ, dietary and 
environmental factors may contrib-
ute to breast cancer. And little legisla-
tion has been passed to facilitate re-
search opportunities. 

However, there is a bit of light at 
the end of the tuMe!. State Senator 
Tom Hayden has introduced a bill, 
SB 1937, which requires that the 
statedevelopsafe-exposurestandards . 
for the hundredsofenvironmentaDy-
based chemical compounds that have 
been linked with increased risk of 
breast cancer. The senate is hearing 
SB 1937 this week and will hope.

and society's attitude toward breast

Classic rock band shines on during Thursday night's 
sold-out performance at lack Murphy Stadium 
What can I say? It was really good? A 

pleasant night out on the whole? Perhaps 
I should try to squeeze in the words, "mas-
sive," "brilliant," "awesome" and "totally 
insane." Any or all of these adjectives 
would describe Pink Floyd's concert last 
Thursday night at Jack Murphy Stadium. 

«Astronomy Domine" opened the show, 
and the rest of the set came predominantly 
from the 1987 albumA Momentary Lapse 
o/Reason. Pink Floyd's performance was 
low-key, but it gave the audience a chance 
to ponder the enormity of the lighting 
setup. 

The stage was surrounded by a 130-
foot-long shell, which the show's lighting 
designers used in nearly every way imag-
inable. At one moment, it glowed with 
primary colors; the next, it was lit with 
images of the universe; later, it seemed to 
be floating. During one particular seg-
ment, it featured scrolls of cryptic, hiero-
glyphic text. The show's sophisticated 
combination of lights, props and pyro-
technics was so impressive that the band's 
presence was almost unnecessary. 

The highlight of Floyd's first set, "One 
of These Days," was delivered complete 

with wind sound effects, scary vocals, a 
guitar solo, plenty of screaming from the 
crowd and two nasty, inflatable hogs. 
These big plastic pigs swayed in turrets 
high above the audience, piercing the 
crowd with their incredibly evil-looking 
spotlight eyes. 

It took only one chord for Pink. Floyd 
fans to guess what was in store next, and 
they instantly resumed their crazed 
screaming. A circular screen had materi-
alized in the middle of the stage's shell, 
ready to project Pink Floyd's twisted 
imagery. The song, "Shine On You Crazy 
Diamond," was accompanied by some 
greaffootage of one of the band's found-
ingfathers,ex-Floyd member Syd Barrett, 
as the band played the anthem in his 
honor . . 

The enthusiasm of the 51,000 mem-
bers of the audience increased as the set 
rolled on. When the band played "Time," 
a song which appeared on the 1973 album 
Dark Side 0/ the Moon, Barrett was re-

Cheap Trick 
Band will play rare club show at Belly Up 

By_ ....... 
lilBtus Editor 

In the midst of a '701 revival, it 
only seems fitting that Cheap Trick 
should make acomebaclt.The baud 
became a veritable icon during the 
'70swith ilSpower~songsabout 
teen love. After it recorded a now 
legendary live album in Budow, 
Japan, the group went into a 
dQwnslide. Critics say that with 
198O'sAli Sh.ooIc Up, Cheap Trick 
opted for a slick:, bland sound, and 
fans agreed as the group's popular-
ity dwindled. Duting a recent phone 
interview, bassist Tom Petersson 
said he doesn't see the group's new 
album Woke Up With II Monster as 
part of a '70s revival. 

"That [revival] can't hurt us, 
but we've been around the whole 
time. We don't care what we're a 
part of," he said. "We do what we 
do. If there's a revival,'fine. But 
it's not like we're a grunge band 
and~enadiscoband. We're pretty 
consistent. .. 

With driving rock tracks such 
as "Ride the Pony" and "Girl-
friends," Woke Up With II Monster 
has the gritty edge that Cheap Trick 
captured on its self-titled debut in 
1976. Peterssonasserted it was just 
a matter of working with a pro-
ducer who would let the band have 
ilS freedom. 

"It [Woke Up] is not an attempt 
to return to an earlier sound - it's 
the way we IOUDd normally," he 
said. "The lut couple records were 
a little slicker but that wasn 't o~r 
choice. It was due to the producer." 

Cheap Trick cut ilS musical teeth 
on the Midwest club circuit in the 
early '70s. Petersson said he fint 
played guitar as a child, but then 
switched to bass to accommodate 
the band. He said that although he 
admires classic rock bass playen, 
Petersson, who plays an uncon-
ventional 12-string bass for live 
performances, also finds some of 
the younger bassists' styles appeal-
ing. 

"I normally like guitar playen. 
I'm a big fan of Jeff Beck, Jimi 
Hendrix and that whole crowd. 

"The new Crowded House al-
bum has some great bass. The new 
Elvis Costello has Nick Lowe play-
ing bass. I liJ(ed Tommy Stinson 
who played bass for the Replace-
menlS - he played great, off-the-
wall stuff. I also liJ(ed Captain 
Beefheart. It doesn't have to be 
complicated or difficult to play. 
McCartney did great stuff. Even 
on his wont material, like 'Silly 
Love Song' -I hate that song-
but it's got a great bassline. He was 
probably the greatest and highly 
underrated ... 

Petensondoesn'tworry about 
bis own rating as a bass player. 
He said he is suspicious of polls 
which decide the best rock bass-
ist of the year. 

"When we fint started out in 
Japan, people told me I was the 
number-two bass player. I said 
[sarcastically], 'Yeah, I'm num-
ber two and the guy from the Bay 
City Rollen is number one. '" 

Cheap Trick is one of the few 
bands that has survived the '70s. 
Although groups like the Eagles 
and Traffic have reunited, OIeap 
Trick has always kept its origi-
nal IilfeUp, which includes gui-
tarist Rick Nielson, singer Robin 
Zander and drummer Bun E. 
Carlos. Petenson said that, at 
this point, band memben have 
leamed to put up with each other. 

"Sure, we get tired of each 
other. We got real sick of each 
other fast and now we don't get 
any more sick of each other," he 
joJ(ed. "We can't hate each other 
any more than we do. It's like 
your apartment. If you don't 
clean it, it won't get any dirtier. 
It's the way we all live - like 
bums." 

Cheap Trick will perform 
Monday at 8:30 p.m. at the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. Info:

If you live in San Diego and the name Drive Lite 
Jehu doesn't riog a bell, you have neglected a huge 
portion of the little culture left in Southern Califor-
nia. In the past week. nothing has given me quite IS 
much joy as listening to my advance copy of the 
band's latest album Yank Crime. 

Fears that the band would compromise its sound 
after signing with Interscope Records, a subsidiary of 
Atlantic Records, can be laid 10 rest. The new album 
is more of the same great, artful, punt-inspired rock 
that characterized the quartet'. fint self-titled re-
lease on the Cargo/Headhunter label. 

On Yank Cr~, the band alternates between fast-
paced, punk-style songs like "Golden Brown" and 
moodier, apthemic songs such as "00 You Com-
pute" and "Sinews," a tracltalso featured on theHead 
Start to Purgatory compilation album. 

The fint two minutes of the new album's sixth 
track, entitled "New Intro," are beautiful, consisting 
of a gentle interplay of melodies which crescendos to 
a wall of John Reis' (of Rocket from the Crypt) 
signature guitar noise. 

The album, produced solely by the band (which 
also includes drummer and UCSD employee Mark 

E 
LJCSD 
BOOKSTORE 

Trombino, bassist Mike Kennedy and guitarisl/vo-
calist Rick Froberg), is every bit as good as fans could 
expect and a perfect introduction for outsiders 10 San

Yank Crime will be in stores on Tuesday.

where it boards up in the cramped

it plays. Although musical perfor-
mances are highlighted, the film

A young avant-garde photog-
rapher, Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl 
Lee), is introduced 10 the band 
through her boyfriend Klaus (Kai 
Wiesinger). Astrid and Stuart im-
mediately take a sensual liking for 
one another. This sets the stage for 
jealous struggles between differ-
ent loyalties and loves. 

Director Softley deals grace-
fuUy with the triangle between 
John, Stuart and Astrid. When 
Stuart meets Astrid, he falls in 
love and begins neglecting his 
commitments to the band. 'John 

The ....... dIspIIy enthuslall11 II they _I'form

begins to fear he will lose Stuart 10 
Astrid. The most intriguing aspect 
of this triangle is the unspoken 
attraction between Astrid and John. 
Softley captures the awkward and 
delicate relationship in the film's 
strongest scene. lohn and Astrid 
are atop a lighthouse as Stuart frol-
ics on the beach with John 's 
fiancee. The scene subtly shows 
the tensions that exist between 
John, Stuart ind Astrid. 

Backbeal captures the youthful 
creativity of its characten, leaving a 
memorable impression on the 
viewer. However, this impression 
can't quite save the film from the 
flat acting (with the exception of 
Hart as John leMon) and laclduster 
dialogue. These elements unfortu-
nately make Backbeat a film that 
rarely rises above mediocrity. 

Backbeal opens at theaters 
throughout San Diego tomorrow.

Backbeat 
Soundtrack 

YI,..nR ...... 

Unlike mos t soundtracks, 
BacJcbeal is not simply a collec-
tion of already-released songs. 
Rather, six alternative rock band 
members have worked with pro-
ducer Don Was to record some of 
the songs the Beatles played dur-
ing the early '60s. 

In the film, the actors, who 
mimic the Beatles' mannerisms 
with accuracy, bring the songs to 
life. The soundtrack does not stand 
up as well on its own. Part of the 
problem is that the musicians seem 
restrained. Vocalist Dave Pirner 
of Soul Asylum, guitarist Thunton 
Moore of Sonic Youth and bassist 
Mike Mills of R.E.M. stay within 
the musical boundaries of classic 
rock. 

With' the exception of "Road-
runner" and "Good Golly Miss 
Molly," the musicians don ' t gen-
erate the same energy for which 
their respective bands are known.

PINK: Visual

placed by 3-D images of clocks, 
robots and machinery. Drummer 
Nick Mason interrupted this mas-
sive lighting bonanza with his per-
cussion performance and light 
show: The large lights went out 
and his green, fluorescent drum-
sticks took centerstage. 

When Mason began to toll the 
bell for "High Hopes," a track on 

tential. The sounds of cash regis-
ters bounced from speaker to 
speaker. 

, The Division Bell, I realized why 
the concert was such an intense 
experience for so many people. 
Pink Floyd's music has captured 
the imagination of generations of 
music lovers. 

The whole group pulled to-
gether for "Comfonably Numb." 
An OVerpoWD dilc:o ball fOIO from 
what seemed to be the depths of 
the earth to tum the stadium into a 
mini-univeneofstars, then opened 
outward to shed strips ofJight over 
the entire audience. This suppos-
edly signified the end of the show. 
What it actually signified was the 
bit wbere the band disappears for 
a (ew minutes, lets the audienc:c 
work itself into a frenzy, and then 
comes back for almock-' em-dead 
encore of "Run Like .Hell" and 
"Hey You." 

To address the burning ques-
tions: Has Pink Floyd lost its 
touch? Are they all show and no 
musical credibility? Does Division 
Bell compare favorably to older 
material? Has the band lost con-
ceptual direction since the split 
with Roger Waters? My answer is 
this: who knows-and who cares? 
They put on a magnificeot spec-
tacle and thrilled many of their 
fans. 

The visual imagery then shifted 
toward the surreal with the song 
"Wish You Were Here." Every-
one knew the words and sang 
along. 

lust when it seemed there could 
be no higher peak to reach, the 
band began to play the enormously 
popular 1979 song "The Wall." 
The band's rendition of "Money"

12 SPORTS n.. UCSD c..Niu 

THE UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Water Skiing 

~t-,. T be -UCSDwater skiina team 
traveled to 

the Bay Area'. frigid waten lut 
weekend to compete in its fint 
tournament of the &prinl season at 
UC Berkeley. A1thoup tbe team 
bad to compete without All-Con-
fereoce skier Alison Walmsley, 
San Diego hit the water and skiied 
to I respec:table finisb in the 10 
team competition. 

Despite the solid effort, UCSD 
coaches were not fully satisfied 
with the team's performance. 

"It was disappointing. Overall 
we got poor performances from 
our skiiers," Head Coach Bill 
Schneiderwind said. 

Geoff Harris was the excep-
tion, turninl in an outstandin, per-
formance in the meet. Harris turned 
more than just a few heads by 
setting personal bests in the sla-
lom and trick competitions, and he 
did not stop there. 

The senior continued his ram-
page in tbe jumping competition, 
in whicb he soared over 90 feet,

The UCSD 
cycling team 
traveled north to 
Los Anleles 
over the week-

end for a two-day competition in 
which it solidified its second-place 
spot in the conference. On day 
one, UCSD provided a dominant 
performance on the T"mplin High-

and on Sunday, 
the peddlers 
ran laps around

The election should give a bil

The same trio teamed up to 
qualify in Sunday's race. This time, 
however, Tobin led the way in sec-

fifth-place finish with Davis on her 
heels in sixtb. 

Another notable ncer for the 
weekend was Erik Stauber of the

The Triton sailon sealed their 
fate lut weekend at the South VII 
nee at Cabrillo ~ Yacht Oub 
by overcomina rough conditions 
and conquering stron, Division I 
opponents. 

"We sailed tbroup some re-
ally strong winds," said co-captain 
Josb Feldman. "If you could just 
finish the race you bad a good 
cbaoce." 

Division A sailors Ed Own-
bers and Kelly Anderesled the way 
for the Tritons, skillfully steerina 
their boat through the roup wllers 
and carefully IimiDg the frequent 
wind shifts. 

Division B skippers Jasoo 
Pettit - a former JV team mem-
ber - and Eric Wilcox also gave 
command performances, leadiog 
tbe UCSD contiolent abead of 
numerous Division I sailing pow-
erbouses. 

The fierce weather caused mul-
tiple boats to capsize. Masts were 
IOIIedleft and right, and some boall 
even got shK:k on the bottom of the 
harbor. -. 

"It wu so roup out there that 
OCC [Oranae Coast College) broke

Women's Lacrosse 

., 

The UCSD women's 
lacrosse team, boasting 
an impressive 8-1 
record, continues to im-

prove on yet another solid regulu 

Comina into the race, UCSD 
needed to beat out UCLA andcross-
town nemesis San Di. State Uni-
versity or be ·within four spots of 
tboee achoola to capture the fifth 
and final spot in the Southern Divi-
sion. 

Instead of merely tryina to stay 
close to UCLA and SDSU, how-
ever, the Tritons rose to the occa-
sion by dodging a graveyud of 
capsized boats and cboppy waters 
to beat both Schools outright. 

Perbapseven more amazina than 
tbe team's exceptional finilb wu 
that UCSD sailed without Arpn-
tine Olympiccbamp GiselleCamet. 

With Camet absenl from the 
Soutb VII regatta, the San Diego 
sailing squad will most likely send 
its mOIl experienced seniora to the 
PeCs. 

"Guys like Ed Chambers will 
probably lOt the nod," Feldman 
said. "1be seniors deserve an op-
portunity to go [to the PCCs)." 

Witb the regulu season at a 
close, the Triton sailors can look 
ahead to April 29 wben they will 
face the top sailing schools in Cali-
fornia, including Stanford and UC 
Berkeley. 

In addition to the best schools of 
California, top-notcb sailing col-
lepsfrom WubingtonandOregon 
will compete. 

"Considerina that it's the first

LOOD 
Postmortem 
On Tonya Tritons Sweep Menlo in Bay Area Series 

I got this funny feeling 
while watching the news last 
weekend that something else 
might have been terribly wrong 
in the whole Nancy-Tonya 
conflagration. 

Dead issue, you say? I 
don't think so. I don 't know 
what set off this strange 
feeling, but it probably had 
something to do with that 
recent shark attack off our 
once-peaceful coastline. 

You see, the TV news was 
telling its viewers to stay calm 
- "nothing to worry about" 
seemed to be the quote of the 
day - but in the meantime, it 
was broadcasting clips from 
the movie Jaws. I guess I was 
supposed to feel calm while 
watching a young woman's leg 
being slowly digested by a 
giant, mechanical great white. 

I digress a bit, but stay with 
me. The point is that there was 
a lot of finger-pointing going 
on in that whole debacle. New 
"scoops" were discovered 
daily, allegations were raised 
and "exclusive" interviews 
were granted. 

"Tonya did this" and 
"Nancy said that" all the papers 
seemed to say. But as people "s 
attention spans shrunk like a 
dime-store t-shirt, the whole 
issue died before anyone could 
point the finger at the real 
culprit of the entire mess. 

The culprit - that dirty 
scoundrel that seemed to shape 
and corrupt everyone's 
thoughts throughout the 
lengthy ordeal - was the 
sports media. 

Ask yourself: Who wired 
Mickey Mouse to listen to 
Nanc:y's irrelevant comments 
that later became national 
news? 

ROWNG: UCSD pushes 
win streak to nine games 
with 7 -6 vict~ry over 
Chapman University 
By JeffPraucM 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team took 
the Bay Area by storm last week-
end, sweeping a three-game series 

from Menlo 
College and 
erasing 
memories of 
last year's 
fateful trip up 
north. Add to 
that a victory 
6 v e r 
Chapman 
University on 
Tuesday, and 
the team now 
sports a 

healthy 25-3 record, the school's 
best in team history. 

Last year, the trip to Menlo ended 
the Tritons' playoff hopes, but this 
season those hopes were victori-
ously cemented. Head Coach Lyle 
Yates threw his top-two guns at 
Menlo in Saturday's doubleheader, 
and both came away with easy vic-
tories. 

Ryan Flanagan (6-1, 2.04 ERA) 
pitched a complete game four-hit-
ter, while yielding only two unearned 
runs. Chris Miyake went 3-for-4 
with a home run and two RBI's in 
the 8-2 triumph. 

In the second game, Mark 
Hartmann (6-1) bold the Oaks in 
check by allowing only a pair of 
runs in seven innings. The story of 
the contest wu the Triton offense, 
which exploded for 15 runs on 17 
hits. Miyake (3-6, 7 RBI's) again 
provided the punch with a tremen-
dous grand slam. Eric Quandt, Dan 
O'Brien and Jason Aguilar each 

Shortstop Chris Mly8ke t.aed Menlo with 7.for-12 bitt .... 8IId 12 rune blltted In tine ,..... 
collected three hits in the 15-4 vic-
tory. 

On Sunday, UCSD was forced to 
play comeback baseball on its way 
to a 6-5 victory. Starting pitcher 
Marc Abrams was roughed up early , 
allowing four runs in the bottom of 
the first inning. 

In the top of the third, the Tritons 
pulled to within 4-3 when Miyake 
doubled with two outs, driving in 
Bobby Alban and Aguilar. 

Menlo added a run in the fifth, 
but the Tritons pulled even in the top 
of the seventh off Oak starter Ryan 
Carey (3-3). After Aguilar led off 
with a base hit. Quandt delivered a 
hit-and-run double down the fint-
bue line, putting numers at second 
and third. Craig Birk and Miyake 
followed with ucrifice Dies, tying 
the score at 5-5. 

UCSD won the game in the ninth 

in unusual fashion. Quandt deliv-
ered his first collegiate home run 
with one out, crusbing the ball over 
the left-field wall. Closer Kurt 
Luhrsen (5'() pitched two scorelell 
innings to pick up the 6-S win. 

UCSD's three-game sweep im-
proved its record to 7'() against Di-
vision III oppooeDlS and virtually 
clinched'the team a playoff spot in 
the upcoming West Regional .. 

Stars of the series included 
Miyake, who went 7-for-12 with 12 
RBI's, and Aguilu, who went 9-
for-13. 

On Tuesday, the Tritonsc:aptured 
yet another one:run victory at the 
banda of Chapman University. 
UCSD took a 2-1 lead in the top of 
the fifth when AI DelFavero singled 
home Apilar. 

The Panthers answered in their 
half of the fifth off of starter Steve 

Height. After Mark Rugprayoon bad 
reached on an infield bit, Height 
apparently picked him off first. But 
O'Brien's throw in the rundowb hit 
the runner and went into left field. 
Jason Smith drove him bome two 
outs later with a base hit, and an 
error by Miyake later allowed Smith 
to CI'OII the plate. 

The Tritons put four runs on the 
board in the sixth. After Birk's RBI-
single, Miyake belted a three-run 
home run to give UCSD a 6-3 lead. 

LeadingJ.-3 enterina the bottom 
oftbe eighth, Yates brought in Mike 
Bryant to relieve HeiJbt (5-0). 
Bryant wu touc:bed for three runs, 
but Lubnen came in to record a key 
double play. The TritoDl held on for 
a 7-6 victory u Lubnen tallied his 
sixth save of the year. 

UCSD bu DOW won Dine games 
in a row and 19 of its lilt 20. 

Who decided to show up in 
droves for a Tonya "press 
conference" at the same time 
that Dan Jansen was speed 
skating his way to one of the 
most memorable gold medal 
performances? 

UCSD Sets Silver Standard at Pt. LODla Invite 
ALL ACES: Defending National Champion Tritons continue to impress as regular season nears its conclusion 

More importantly, who 
wasted millions of trees on 
reports about Nancy and Tonya 
while numerous other athletes 
were much more deserving? 

I just hope that the 1994 
Winter Olympics won't be 
remembered as the "Nanc:y-
Tonya fest." But, sadly, these 
media images are stuck in my 
mind as vividly as those scenes 
from Jaws.

And then there was one. With 
Monday's second-place finish in the 
Point Loma Nazarene Invitational, 
the UCSD golf team has one more 
regular season tournament before 
the real season begins - the Divi-
sion III National Championships. 

Monday's 387 at the Rancho San

strokes behind Division I cross-town
