SURF REPORT

By ayan kusari
Senior Staff Writer

Gov. Jerry Brown approved 
a highly modified version of the 
Working Families Student Fee 
Transparency Act, or AB 970, on Sept. 
27. Proposed by State Assemblyman 
Paul Fong (D-Cupertino) in 2011 
and co-sponsored by the UC and 
Cal State Student Associations, the 
bill will force state university systems 
to give ample warning to students 
before enacting tuition hikes.

The bill was introduced as a 
response to the many mid-year tuition 
hikes that the two state university 
systems have faced in recent years.

“Between 1990 and 2009, costs 
for a University of California student 
living on-campus rose by 70 percent,” 

AB 970 reads. “Costs for a California 
State University student living with 
his or her family rose by over 80 
percent. In this period, median 
family income in California grew by 
only 16 percent.”

Under the original AB 970, drafted 
by Fong and the Student Associations, 
the UC Board of Regents would have 
to publicly propose a fee increase 
90 days before voting on it. They 
would also have to vote six months 
before the increase went into effect. 
Amendments to the bill have drained 
the required minimum period 
between the vote and the fee increase: 
It currently stands at 30 days.

UC spokesperson Steve Montiel, 
from the UC Office of the President, 
said short-notice fee increases during 
the school year were necessary given 

the difficult economic times.
“We can no longer rely upon the 

state of California as a consistent 
source of funding. A six-month 
window would be unreasonable,” he 
said.

The UCOP has consistently voiced 
its reservations about AB 970. In a 
letter to the State Assembly sent on 
June 23, 2011, UCOP criticized the 
measure for containing restrictions 
on the Regents, but no provisions for 
increasing state funding.

“Without a broader plan to 
develop a stable and predictable 
program of state support, [AB 970] 
is illusory.”

Under AB 970, the UC Regents’ 
fee increase proposals must

University Centers announced on Wednesday, Sept. 26, that the Craft Center will close 
during the 2012-13 academic year due 
to budget cuts. The center has been 
open for 40 years. Administration 
does not know whether the center will 
reopen in the near future.

The Craft Center staff were 
unaware that the center was closing 
until they were notified on Sept. 26. 
The announcement was unexpected; 
the fall brochure had already gone 
out and they were already taking class 
registration. 

The staff members were also in the 
process of planning their holiday sale, 
their annual faculty art show and a 
special fundraiser.

“People are devastated and 
heartbroken and there’s anger about 
it,” Craft Center Interim Director Joyce 
Rooks said. “I think we’re just going 
through the grieving process.”

Staff members will have until 
Nov. 11 to clean out the building, 
return artists’ work and allow artists 
to complete their works-in-progress. 

Many artists rely on the Craft  Center 
for their income. Some of these artists 
are teachers there as well.

“The Craft Center has always been 
under threat, partly because of the 
condition of the facility — and it’s the 
arts, and the arts are usually threatened 
in some kind of way,” Rooks said.

Rooks said that she expected the 
Craft Center to reopen next year, based 
on what the administration had told 
her. 

University Centers provides 
funding for the Craft Center. University 
Centers Interim Director Sharon 
Van Bruggen said the Craft Center’s 
primary income comes from its classes 
and activities, but that this income is 

not enough to cover all of its expenses, 
even with the funding from University 
Centers. It costs about $594,000 a year 
to operate the Craft Center. The two-
year average income is about $377,000, 
based on the last two fiscal years. 

The president of the University 
Centers Advisory Board (UCAB), 
Albert Trujillo, met with Van Bruggen 
over the summer to balance the 
University Centers’ budget. Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Gary Ratcliff, A.S. 
executives and Graduate Student 
Association executives joined them to 
discuss the budget situation. 

University Centers had the Craft 
Center’s facility conditions assessed by 
the ISES Corporation in April 2012. 

The ISES assessment found that the 
Craft Center needs at least $1.5 million 
in repairs, $1.27 million of which 
would need to be spent in the next 
year. The assessment does not include 
issues with the building foundation 
and construction. ISES also assessed 
Price Center, Student Center and Che 
Cafe, and concluded that, coupled with 
the Craft Center, renovations would 
cost $10.5 million over the next eight 
to 10 years. The number increased to 
$14 million when a third party did not 
review the projects. 

Trujillo said that University Centers 
was not capable of paying for the $1.27 

Marshall 
Senior Killed 
Monday in 
Shooting

New Law Will Alert Students to Fee Hikes

Marshall College senior Julio 
Manuel Alcantar, 23, was fatally shot 
in Los Angeles on Monday night. 
Alcantar was walking in the Hyde 
Park neighborhood with his brother 
and a friend at 9 p.m. when a lone 
suspect walked over and opened fire. 
The other two victims are in serious 
condition. The suspect is still at large.

A memorial was held at UCSD 
Oct. 3 in Center Hall. 

Alcantar, a senior ethnic studies 
major, was part of Oasis’s Summer 
Bridge program — a program 
designed to help incoming freshmen 
transition into campus life and 
university classes.

At the memorial, participants 
reflected on Alcantar’s constant 
positivity and goodwill. He went out 
of his way to say hello if he saw a 
friend walking around campus. The 
students at the memorial made plans 
to raise money for the family.

“I think something I’ll never forget 
about Julio is that he was positive,” 
Marshall senior Sashieana Scott said 
at the memorial. “He always turned 
a negative into a positive; he always 
had a smile on his face. 

Other friends remember Alcantar 
as a high achiever who wanted to help 
people in dangerous neighborhoods.

“He really believed he would go 
back and be that shining light for 
everybody,” Muir College alumnus 
Jorge Narvaez said.

In the first study of its kind, 
researchers at the UC San Diego 
School of Medicine discovered that 
patients who have had an entire 
kidney removed have a significantly 
higher risk of erectile dysfunction 
than those who undergo partial 
kidney removal. 

Program Director of the UCSD 
Cancer Center Urologic Oncology 
Fellowship, Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, 
co-authored and published an 
analytical paper in the British 
Journal of Urology on July 3, after 
concluding a retrospective study 
by comparing a 168-man group of 
patients who had partial kidney 
removal to a 264-man group who 
had complete kidney removal. 

Patients who had complete 
kidney removal were 3.5 times more 
likely to develop erectile dysfunction 
compared to those who had kidney 
reconstruction; this is a normalized 
value that takes factors like pre-

existing cardiovascular problems 
into consideration. After about six 
years, 29.5 percent of the men in 
the latter group developed erectile 
dysfunction. Only 9.5 percent 
of those who had partial kidney 
removal developed the dysfunction.  

Kidney removal, or 
“nephrectomy,” is usually performed 

on patients with seriously damaged 
or diseased kidneys. Urological 
experts agree that the partial 
procedure is optimal for those with 
small, single tumors. 

“We’ve been finding more and 
more patients with earlier stage 
disease and smaller tumors,” 
Derweesh said. “With that comes 

the recognition that removal of a 
significant amount of kidney tissue 
may actually be increasing the risk of 
kidney disease and other diseases.”

Prior research led by Dr. 
Derweesh has shown that partial 
nephrectomy also decreases the 
risk of osteoporosis and chronic 
kidney insufficiency in patients. In 
April, Dr. Derweesh published a 
paper citing findings that partial 
nephrectomy means a significantly 
higher likelihood of anemia onset. 

“Generally, even for tumors that 
are two centimeters and below, 
the rates for partial nephrectomies 
— even though it has gone up in 
recent years — is still about 40 to 
50 percent and I would say that 
is a gross underutilization of the 
procedure,” Derweesh said. 

Two-thirds to three-fourths of 
kidney removal surgeries performed 
at UCSD are partial nephrectomies, 
according to Lead Author of Study 
and Chief Resident, UCSD School 
of Medicine, Division of Urology, 
Dr. Ryan Kopp.

Researchers from the study 
include local experts, professionals 
from the University of Tennessee 
Health Science Center and other 
UCSD scientists.

“A question that is important 
to us is whether or not there is 
a threshold at which partial 
nephrectomy no longer infers a 
benefit, and we intend to look into 
that,” Kopp said.

Further research may take place 
soon, pending additional funding 
from the Sexual Medicine Society of 
North America.  

“We’re in the process of 
putting together grant proposals 
for prospective studies that will 
further analyze the interrelationship 
between kidney surgery and various 
metabolic and cardiovascular 
consequences and we will also see 
what measures we may be able to 
take to prevent these,” Derweesh 
said.

There was plenty of cheering and whooping and treats to usher in the first council 
meeting of this school year.

A.S. Graphic 
Studios handed 
out giant novelty 
to lollipops to 
members of 
council.

Triton 
Outfitters 
distributed T-shirts 
as prizes to council 
members who could answer trivia 
questions about Triton Outfitters.

AVP of Student Services John 
Weng  introduced council to the 
heads of TritonTV and KDST and 
announced prospective changes to 
programs under the student services 
umbrella.

Weng announced that he’s 
in negotiations to get TritonTV 
broadcast on UCSD-TV and UCTV, 
which would give it a statewide 
viewership. He also has plans to 
create an in-house studio for KDST.

“For the first time in five years, 
since my office was created, my 
office will have a structured staff,” 
he said.

Weng revealed the changes 
coming to A.S. Safe Rides, including 
an online sign-up system, an iPad to 
swipe when entering the Safe Ride 
bus and an email notification system 
for students when they’ve used all 
three of their safe ride passes.

He also told council that there 
will be new condom machines all 
around the six colleges in addition 
to the machines already stationed 
inside the price center.

Council then proceeded to debate 
the merits of changing the name of 
the Safe Ride program from “Safe 
Ride” to “Safe Rides.”

AVP Concert and Events Eric 

Babajanian pitched both Hullabaloo 
and the upcoming Bear Gardens 
which will feature Oktoberfest-style 
beers.

Campuswide 
Senator Summer 
Perez asked 
council if they 
would be willing 
to dress up for 
the meeting that 
will take place on 
Halloween.

VP External 
Olamide Noah told council that the 
student regents will be on campus 
next week to take questions from 
students and constituents.

Campuswide Senator Brad 
Segal’s Human Rights Board project 
has been tabled for eight weeks 
as he goes to different student 
organizations to receive feedback 
about implementation.

VP Finance & Resources Bryan 
Cassella briefed council on their 
deficit and his plan to combat it. 
He explained that there are three 
main reasons for the deficit, under 
enrollment, overallocation and 
overspending. Council currently has 
a deficit of $268,266.76.

“I’ve been really impressed by 
the way cabinet has been taking care 
of it, I’ve said here’s the number we 
have to meet, we have to make cuts, 
and they’ve been really professional 
about it,” Cassella said.

Cassella plans to come out with a 
10-year plan later this year.

“I just think it’s really important 
that every A.S. member knows these 
numbers and knows what’s going 
on, this is something that we’re all 
in together, AVP Diversity Affairs 
Elizabeth Garcia said.

The councilmembers of the week 
were Noah, Cassella and VP Student 
Life Cody Marshall.

Council Holds First Meeting; 
Recieve Triton Outfitters Gear million for the Craft Center within the 

next year. 
The decision to shut down the Craft 

Center was based on facility needs, 
student usage and student priorities. 

“Student usage is pretty low despite 
efforts to increase advertisements and 
get more of an appeal to the Craft 
Center,” Trujillo said.

In 2011-12, a of 1,928 people used 
the Craft Center, 524 of them students. 
That was 14 fewer students than in 
2010-11, 36 fewer students than in 
2009-2010 and 79 fewer students than 
2004-05. 

Van Bruggen wrote in an email to 
the Guardian that the staff had tried to 
increase prices, charge materials fees 
and increase income from special sales 
to help the Craft Center. 

But the course fees would need to 
be quadrupled for the Craft Center to 
become a self-supporting operation. 

“Unfortunately, while these efforts 
start to address the budget need, they 
do not address the looming facility 
costs,” Van Bruggen wrote. “The one-
year closure provides the opportunity 
to explore the feasibility of other ideas.”

Trujillo said efforts to save the 

Craft Center will continue. UCAB is 
discussing a student referendum with 
the A.S. Council and the GSA. 

“It’s something that we definitely 
value and appreciate and it’s something 
that I’m really sad to see go,” Trujillo 
said. “I personally really encourage the 
arts.”

University Centers has cut other 
services as well. Price Center hours 
have been reduced on Fridays, 
Saturdays and Sundays. University 
Centers programs, including concerts 
and events at PC Ballrooms, Pub Stage 
Room, The Loft and PC Theater also 
lost funding. The Commuter Student 
Services office will be closed, vacant 

staff positions will remain vacant 
and facility maintenance and repairs 
have been postponed unless they are 
linked to safety, revenue generation or 
accessibility. Off-campus users have to 
pay higher reservation fees.   

“I have a great love for the Craft 
Center, as does everybody who has 
taken classes here and people that teach 
here and great love for art,” Rooks said. 
“I feel like the university is shooting 
itself in the foot and I think that we are 
just as important as the research and 
science that goes on here.

AB 970 Sought to Increase Transparency for Students on Fees

DanIEl Song

Business

include three things: justification, 
thorough analysis of impact on 
underrepresented students and 
a statement specifying what the 
increased fees will be used for.

UCSA Board Member Raquel 
Morales, a senior at UCSD, said in 
a video on Gov. Brown’s website that 
AB 970 was something students and 
families of students have wanted for 
a long time.

“They simply want to have 
the opportunity to defend their 
education and engage themselves in 

the process,” Morales said. 
Promoting student engagement 

and increasing transparency from the 
Regents are the two major goals of 
AB 970, its supporters say.

“We need dialogue,” Morales 
stated in the video.

But Montiel said that even 
though students may express their 
perspectives under the modified 
provisions of AB 970, they don’t have 
veto power. He also said he thought 
there was already a great deal of 
transparency.

“We already have representation. 
We already consult with student 

leadership. It may be distasteful, but 
it’s very transparent, even without AB 
970. The truth is, no one gets excited 
about tuition hikes.”

According to 66028.7 (a) of AB 
970, a consultation is defined as a 
formal meeting in which fee hike 
information is given, not one in 
which students have the power to 
blunt any tuition increases. 

“Nothing in these sections shall 
be construed to exempt any increase 
in mandatory system-wide fees.”

This year, UCSD became the first university in the UC system to guarantee four-year housing to incoming freshmen. And 
with all the new residential buildings popping 
up on campus, from the Village West to Keeling 
apartments (completed August 2011), UCSD 
certainly has room for a few more tenants. This 
is due to a five-year building program, completed 
last year, that nearly doubled housing capacity 
on campus, according to Mark Cunningham, 
assistant vice chancellor of housing and dining. 
While providing four years of on-campus housing 
is a nice option to offer, the problem is that many 
students simply can’t afford it. 

An upside to living on campus is that your rent 
is all-inclusive: furniture, cable, Internet and gas 
and electric. This makes move in so much easier 
since students walk into a fully furnished home 
their first day, and only have to worry about a 
single rent bill. For a student with a comfortable 
financial situation, on campus is the place to be. 
But at $11,298 a year for a single room — that’s 
$1,225 per month — it is also some of the most 
expensive rent you’ll find, and considering we live 
in La Jolla, this is no small boast. When compared 
to the townhouses just off campus in La Jolla Vista 
Townhouses (nicknamed “Regents” for its close 
proximity to the Regents parking lot), the cost of a 

single room hovers around $730 a month, or $450 
if splitting a master bedroom. If you add gas and 
electric ($10 a month) and Internet ($8), the bill is 
still significantly lower than on-campus housing. 
The only major expense is buying furniture if 
needed. That one-time cost is often simply solved 
by Craigslist or graduating friends desperate to get 
rid of old furniture.

It is on-campus housing, combined with the 
required meal plan, that really leaves student 
bank accounts deflated. Even Yahoo! News did a 
story on us. A 2007 story, titled “The Freshman 
Minus-15: Students at UC San Diego Are Kept 
in a Perpetual State of Hunger by the School’s 
Draconian Dining Hall Policy,” reported that 
students were coming home from Winter Break as 
“shells of their former selves” because the dining 
hall prices were too high for students to afford 
full meals every day. Since then, UCSD has not 
lowered food prices, but instead increased the 
required amount of meal points a dorm resident 
must purchase. Meal plans have increased from 
$1,800 in 2007 to $2,950 in 2012, a $1,000 
increases over the past five years. Being required to 
spend nearly $3,000 on expensive dining hall food 
is enough to turn many students away from living 
on campus. 

So let’s do the math here. A frugal student who 

UCSD is offering freshmen guaranteed four-year housing for the first time ever — a privi-
lege that ultimately boasts an off-putting price.

As the 2012 election looms, we must deal yet again with the obnoxious naysayers who 
like to claim that voting is pointless 
and that both parties are in thrall to 
some nefarious corporate conspiracy. 
It is high time for the apathetic and 
young to face the fact that we have far 
more control of our destiny than it 
may seem, and that we are not merely 
victims of a political system but active 
participants.

To those who see no difference 
in presidential candidates, consider 
that there is no dispute that an Al 

Gore presidency would have been far 
different from the one led by George 
W. Bush. We would have likely made 
significant steps in reducing carbon 
emissions and kept Clinton era tax 
rates on the rich. Had a few thousand 
votes went the other way in Florida, 
our nation would be very different. 
The very purpose of voting is to 
create difference and change in public 
policy. In fact, this is why autocratic 
regimes like China’s or Syria’s do all 
in their power to prevent the masses 
from exercising this freedom.

In the current contest between 
President Barack Obama and Gov. 
Mitt Romney, we are presented with 
starkly different visions. Obama 
supports a strong safety net to 
support the worst-off, while Romney 
believes this same safety net breeds 
dependency. In Obama’s vision, 
programs like Medicaid that help 
the elderly, disabled and poor are 
strengthened, while in Romney’s, 
Medicaid will be cut. Maybe if one 
is a young member of the upper 
middle class, these choices may seem 
abstract. However, to the millions 
who need assistance, the choice is as 
clear as daylight.

Admittedly, one’s vote for the 
presidential candidate will matter less 
in partisan states like California or 
Texas. Nonetheless, in California, we 
are presented with important ballot 
measures and local candidates where, 
once again, every vote matters. The 
race for the 52nd Congressional 
District that covers most of La Jolla, 
for example, is one of the most closely 
disputed contests in the nation. Every 
vote will matter because the margin 
of victory will be so small.

For the youth, voting is even more 
important. Most of us in our 20s have 
another 60 years to go. We can shape 
how these 60 years turn out through 
our policy choices. Yet, election after 
election, it is the old who turn out 
the most despite them having fewer 
years to worry about. Voting is an 
investment for our future and like 
any investment, it is a poor decision

Most students would take any amount of temporary 
discomfort for a $30,000 check. So 
when the University of California 
announced Sept. 27 that it reached 
a $1-million settlement with the 
victims of the infamous UC Davis 
pepper spray incident, grumblings 
could be heard across the UC 
campuses on social media.

As a result of the settlement, 
each of the 21 victims will receive 
$30,000 and a handwritten apology 
letter from UCD Chancellor Linda 
Katehi, forcing many students to 
ask themselves, “Would you get 
pepper-sprayed for 30K?” And 
many wish they did.

But the fact of the matter is, 
this money is only going to go 
straight back into the UC system, 
with the students likely using it 

to cover the rising fees they were 
protesting. It is then crucial that 
we move the dialogue toward the 
preventative measures listed in UC 
President Mark G. Yudof ’s recently 
commissioned report, rather than 
the money given to the victims.

Sad irony aside, the settlement 
itself shows that the UC system 
acknowledges that what happened 
last November was wrong. 
(Reports indicate poorly timed 
efforts to evict the campers and 
a questionable legal basis for the 
operation.) 

It is precisely because of these 
gaffes that we should make sure 
there is not a structure that causes 
the pepper-spray incident to 
happen again — something the UC 
system has already done.

One such preventative measure 

is the report commissioned by 
Yudof seeking advice from UC 
General Counsel Charles F. 
Robinson and UC Berkeley Law 
School Dean Christopher F. Edley 
Jr. The report, released onSept. 13, 
includes 49 suggestions to prevent 
similar incidents. 

Possibilities include establishing 
a student advocate within the 
Administration responsible for 
listening to concerns, having 
the Chancellor attend student 
government meetings and 
instituting monthly “office hours” 
for top administrators.

The report also suggests 
campuses train mediators, who 
could facilitate discussion between 
protesters and the administration 
during civil disobedience events, 
although it did state that pepper 

spray might remain a necessary last 
resort. 

Thankfully, there’s a designated 
person we can watch to make 
sure these changes actually 
happen. Yudof announced that 
Associate Vice President of 
the UC Office of the President 
Communications Lynn Tierney 
will oversee the implementation of 
the recommendations, though how 
serious she’ll be about overseeing 
any real change will remain to be 
seen. Regardless, it’s the report, 
not the money, that’s really 
addressing what the students were 
fighting for, so it’s the report we 
should be scrutinizing. And more 
importantly, we need to make sure 
Tierney follows through with some 
kind of action.

Academy Award-winning filmmaker and playwright 
Martin McDonagh talks playing with genre, writing about writing 

and his new meta neckbreaker “seven Psychopaths.” 
By Ren eBel • A&e editoR / coveR illustRAtion By snighdhA pAul

I t wasn’t until the tenth time I listened to “Mercy” in a row that I finally said, “Enough.”
I was hearing “I’m in that two 

seat Lambo with your girl she tryna 
jerk me” on a loop in my head — 
and I was sick of the reminder of 
Kanye West’s penis. A lot of hip 
hop can desensitize a girl, but 
somewhere around Big Sean’s mil-
lionth ass pun, I had finally reached 
a breaking point.

I sat down and took a look at 
the culprits in my iTunes collec-
tion and there was only one logical 
conclusion. 

“I think we need some time 
apart.”

Handsome faces stared back at 
me, begging me to reconsider. 

“It’s not that I don’t love these 
guys,” I thought. “But for once, I 
need to hear a voice that sounds 
like my own.”

So I came up with a challenge 
and convinced some girlfriends 
to join me: For the entire month 
of October, we’re going to put all 
the men in our musical lives aside 
and listen only to music made by 
women. For a lack of better allitera-
tion, it’s Ovaries October.

There are a few rules to the 
challenge. For one, co-ed bands are 
acceptable so long as the women 
make an obvious contribution 
(i.e. sing or write). In essence, the 
women need to be noticeable, pres-
ent and in the foreground — that 
one band with that one hot chick 
bassist doesn’t qualify. In true bra-
waving, feminist fashion, if there’s 
only one girl, she needs an actual 
identity.  

Secondly, it’s totally acceptable 
to listen to men when you have no 
control over the music playing. So 
when you’re out in the club and sip-
ping that bub and they aren’t play-
ing Lady Gaga, but Usher — never 
fear. You haven’t lost yet. 

Rules aside, now that we’re 
already a few days into the month, 
it’s all smooth sailing from here. 
I have 960 tracks (and counting) 
lumped into one giant Spotify play-
list to share with the other chal-
lenge participants, and I’ve upped 
the estrogen on my iPod by remov-
ing the men and replacing them 
with my favorite ladies. 

What I’ve learned so far: 
Ovaries October is harder for some 
musical tastes than others. I have 
one friend who’s already annoyed 
that she can’t listen to Lil B, and 
another who can’t listen to any of 
her favorite composers. For me, it’s 
surprisingly easy. 

Almost immediately, Ovaries 
October made it apparent how 
many different female voices there 
are. The women on my playlist have 
different levels of power and con-
trol, different levels of sexuality and 
even different levels of talent. 

There are the girl groups — 
The Ronettes, The Crystals, The 
Shangri-Las, to name a few — who 
were so obviously interchange-
able puppets for the men, like 
Phil Spector, who produced their 
records. There are pop stars like 
Madonna and Britney Spears, who 
many would argue are just like the 
aforementioned girl groups, but 
who also use their sexuality as a

the Ladies

How to Write Insane

Y ou can’t let the animals die, just the women.” Martin McDonagh smirks as he takes a sip from his orange juice.  
It’s a windy day and the 40-year-old writer/director is lounging 

on the roof of the W Hotel in downtown San Diego. Tomorrow 
night, he’ll premiere his new film “Seven Psychopaths” at the 
San Diego Film Festival. Like much of McDonagh’s work, “Seven 
Psychopaths” is an air-tight bit of blood-splattered fiction — 
entangling humor, extreme brutality and an underlying love for his 
characters in a deceptively vast web of jubilant chaos. At the center 
of this maelstrom: one troublesome shih tzu. 

“That’s all you hear from the studio,” says McDonagh. “In an 
early version of the script, the dog didn’t necessarily make it out in 
the end. I got so many notes about that, but not a single note about 
how many women got killed. Not one [laughs]. But it’s good that 
we get those notes because that’s what the film is criticizing.”

McDonagh has been known, more than occasionally, to hide 
his transgressive and poignant undertones in the least likely of 
places. And whether he’s jabbing movie studios, pop culture 
or himself, McDonagh’s delivery is consistently as sharp as it is 
unpredictable. 

“It’s about trickery,” says McDonagh. “I like twists, and you can 
always hide a twist in a joke, because people laugh at a joke and 
then dismiss it.”

When he retired from theater to focus on film five years ago, 
McDonagh was already an established playwright with seven 
acclaimed plays and four Tony nominations under his belt. 
His first stab at film, the brilliant “Six Shooter,” took home an 
Academy Award for best live action short. His first feature length, 
“In Bruges,” gained a near-immediate cult following as well as an 
Oscar nomination for original screenplay. “Seven Psychopaths” 
is McDonagh’s third cinematic outing and undoubtedly his most 
ambitious.

“I think it took a while to get to a place where I enjoyed writing 
film, because I found films a lot harder to write than plays,” says 
McDonagh. “I’ve always found plays quite easy, especially if you’re 
good with dialogue and character — it’s kind of all you need in 
some ways. But with films you have to think in images, and you 
can jump around in time and space and geography, and things are 

much more subtle in many ways. So it took me awhile. But right 
now, I think I’d be more comfortable sitting down to write a film 
than a play.”

And “Seven Psychopaths” is first and foremost a film about 
writing. It follows protagonist Marty (Colin Farrell), a screenwriter 
whose latest project ‘Seven Psychopaths’ has come to a halt in the 
midst of severe writer’s block. Meanwhile, Marty’s friends Billy 
(Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) evade the ruth-
less crime boss Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson) after inadver-
tently stealing his beloved shih tzu. The product reads as a grittier, 
less recursive parallel to Charlie Kaufman’s meta masterpiece 
“Adaptation”: the plot weaves between the fictional screenplay and 
the life of the man writing it (who is, essentially, a fictionalized 
McDonagh).

“Well I wouldn’t say that it is me, but I liked the idea of 
throwing just enough red herrings in there,” says McDonagh. 
“Obviously, naming the main character with my name and making

T here’s an elephant in nearly every dorm room. It’s not your suitemate’s newfound sexual 
liberation. It’s not the few pounds 

you gained from too many late 
night trips to Goody’s. It’s not the 
cloud of smoke in your RA’s suite. 
It’s depression, and it’s often the 
one secret that doesn’t rear its head 
during those deep, 4 a.m post-party 
discussions.

Getting called a bitch, a slut or 
an asshole hurts but can be easily 
combatted with a Facebook friend 
deletion and cathartic shit-talking. 
But the worst thing you can be 
called is “crazy.” Then, it’s not about 
your choice of clothing or your lazy 
living habits. It’s about how you 
perceive things, and our thoughts 
and feelings are the most funda-
mental parts of who we are. To have 
someone invalidate how you feel is 
the most damning thing they could 
do.

Depression, which is disturb-
ingly common among college 
campuses these days, is crippling. 
No one wants to talk about it, 
lest be labeled as “crazy.”  College

Fighting the 
Freshman 15

wELLnEss

Your parents warned you about it. Your friends tried to stop you. But sometimes it happens 
— you hit the freshman 15. 

Whether it’s gaining or losing 
15 pounds, the freshman 15 can 
strongly affect your life. Freshman 
year is already so stressful for so 
many reasons, and the last thing 
anyone should worry about is those 

few extra pounds. Maintaining your 
personal wellbeing is the key to 
happiness, good health and overall 
success throughout college and in 
life. Fortunately, UCSD’s Health, 
Recreation and Well-Being services 
offer many free or cheap programs 
and opportunities, such as intra-
mural sports, recreational clubs and 
activities, to help students maintain a 

healthy lifestyle.
One of the few great resources 

that UCSD supplies is The Zone. 
Located in Price Center Plaza, The 
Zone opened in the fall of 2010 and 
promotes eight dimensions of well 
being: social, spiritual, occupational, 
financial, environmental, physical,

Take it from a high school introvert: “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” may be 
as close Hollywood will ever get to 
depicting the real thing.

Admittedly, 
teenage angst in 
cinema is nothing 
new. And the plot 
of “Wallflower ” 
— based on the 
massively popular 
1999 novel by 
Stephen Chbosky 
— has defi-
nitely been done 
before: Lonely boy feels lonely, 
lonely boy finally finds friends, 
lonely boy feels accepted, lonely 
boy falls in love. But the strength 
of “Wallflower” lies in its realistic 
flourishes, which transform what 
might have been a pulpy drama 
into something that often manages 
to feel genuine.

Take the fact that it’s an intel-
ligent, beautiful girl who bullies 
Charlie (Logan Lerman), the hero 
and titular wallflower of the film. 
A typical teen movie would have 
made her six feet tall and male. But 
as any recent high school grad will 
tell you, bullies take all shapes and 
sizes; they don’t have to be cheer-
leaders and jocks.

And then take Charlie himself: 

He manages to be tortured, shy 
and good-hearted without being 
defined by any one of the three 
traits — a testament to Lerman’s 
subtlety as an actor. He doesn’t 

stutter, wear coke-bottle lenses, 
act effeminate or display 
superhuman intelligence. He 
just talks less and keeps to the 
edges of rooms — that is, until 
he is discovered by established 
outcasts Sam (Emma Watson) 
and Patrick (Ezra Miller), who 
take Charlie under their wing.

“Wallflower”’s not perfect. 
Emma Watson’s occasional slip 

into British accent, while perhaps 
subjectively endearing, detracts 
from the charged hyper-realism 
that is “Wallflower”’s ultimate 
strength. The farcical, flamboyant 
kiss between Harvard-bound goth 
Mary-Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) 
and Charlie is a bit of stereotypical 
high school drama that the film 
could have done without.

But the other two kisses in the 
movie are understated and capture 
nicely the ambiguities of teenage 
love. Sam kisses Charlie because 
she loves him in a platonic sense, 
and wants his first kiss to be “from 
someone who truly loves him.” 
Similarly, Charlie — who is straight 
— lets Patrick kiss him because he’s 
concerned about his friend’s loneli-

ness. The emotions that surround 
these kisses are never developed or 
explained, but left the way they feel 
in high school: brief, volatile and 
indistinct.

As college students, it’s tempting 
for us to dismiss our teenage prob-
lems as small and mundane. But 
“Wallflower” does an incredible job 
at keeping its older viewers from 
doing just that, using every trick 
in the book to make the ordinary 
seem enormous. Hushed conversa-
tions about love are truncated half 
a sentence before a lover’s name is 
revealed. Kissing scenes are shot 

in muted tones, from a distance 
and off to the side. Lips are kept in 
shadows as cellos and horns play 
grand orchestral classics.

It’s in this capacity — elevating 
and immortalizing the experi-
ence of adolescence — that this 
movie shines. Though none of the 
lead actors are teenagers, they’re 
almost good enough to trick you 
into thinking they are. Farcical 
moments aside, they capture the 
subtler shades of teenage love and 
loneliness like few others before 
them. And that’s enough to make it 
worth a watch.

statement of independence. 
Then there are the straight-up 

rock ‘n’ roll heroes of the bunch: 
Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Patti 
Smith — true artists who’ve made 
timeless music that transcends their 
gender entirely. Take Mitchell. At 
first, she was the archetypal female 
folkie singer in the vein of Joan 
Baez, but she quickly picked up jazz 
influences which set her apart from 
other like-minded artists at the 
time. Bob Dylan is the only song-
writer who compares.

Admittedly, I don’t really know 
quite yet what I’m trying to discov-
er with this challenge, if anything. I 
guess I thought that if I only expe-
rienced music made by females, I 
might gain insight on femininity or 
life or whatever. 

For now, it’s just been a treat 
to listen to some of the best music 
of all time. I encourage everyone 
to join me in this challenge, male 
or female, whatever your musical 
preferences. It doesn’t matter if 
you’re a latecomer — you can start 
Oct. 4 or Oct. 25, it doesn’t mat-

life to appreciate performers who 
are often overlooked by their male 
counterparts. Just search “Ovaries 
October” on Spotify, subscribe to 
the playlist and add your favorites 
to the mix.

end of the month once I’m ready to 
hear some lower octaves already.

Tender Greens
g reat news: You no lon-ger need to feel guilty when trying on clothes at 
Westfield Shoppingtown UTC after 
a hearty meal. 

Just a bus ride away from cam-
pus, the new restaurant Tender 
Greens is a product of the mall’s 
ongoing renovations. Tender 
Greens, as its menu states, is a 
southern California “fast casual” 

dining chain 
that boasts 
locally 
grown 
and raised 
food, serv-
ing mainly 
salads and 
grilled pro-
teins.

Right 
when you 
walk into 
Tender 
Greens, the 
restaurant 

instantly embodies the southern 
California lifestyle. The atmosphere 
is reminiscent of an upscale version 
of UCSD’s own dining hall Pines — 
clean, simple and wooden.

Dining out is often limited for 
vegetarians, but Tender Greens 
caters to just that demographic 
while also offering plenty of other 
options for those that want some 
protein with their salads. They even 
have food for the adventurous diner 
(their Tuna Nicoise salad comes 
with quail eggs).

There really is something for 
everyone, including the Happy 
Vegan, a salad that consists of 
cranberry and hazelnuts, quinoa 
with cucumber and beats, green 
hummus, tabbouleh and lettuce. 
But for those who enjoy a good 

steak or BBQ every once in awhile, 
Tender Greens has options like 
the Backyard Marinated Steak and 
the Chipotle Barbecue Chicken. 
Most of the items on their menu 
are generously portioned and mod-
erately priced at $11. Patrons can 
choose from 12 Big Salads ($11), a 
simple salad ($6), grilled meat or 
vegetables with either a small salad 
or arguably the best garlic mashed 
potatoes of all time ($11). Their 
Mint Lemonade is a perfect com-
plement drink ($3). It’s unlike any 
other lemonade, because it has mint 
in it. The mint is a perfect balance 

to the tangy taste of the lemonade. 
For vegetarians, it is recom-

mended to order the Grilled 
Vegetables either on a ciabatta or 
on a hot plate ($11). All of the 
vegetables are grilled and seasoned 
perfectly with olive oil and chili, 
giving the mild flavored vegetables 
the kick they need. This meal 
comes with your choice of potatoes 
or a simple salad. Although there 
is a Tender Greens salad, it’s quite 
underwhelming. It’s merely lettuce 
and balsamic vinegar. In short, it’s 
not worthy to be named after the 
restaurant. A better side would be 

either the garlic mash potatoes or 
the Romaine Hearts salad. 

Although Tender Greens has no 
real waiters, its customer service 
is unparalleled to many other fast, 
casual restaurants. The employees 
provide patrons with friendly and 
attentive service. If you’re craving 
a little BBQ or steak with a “fast 
casual” setting, Tender Greens 
proves to be a healthier option 
than the go-to San Diego landmark 
Phil’s BBQ.

tations. For students with SHIP, her 
services are free, and for those without 
SHIP, a small price of $20 is neces-
sary. Call Central Scheduling in order 
to schedule an appointment and take 

one step closer to good, overall health.
UCSD Recreation organizes other 

great activities. This on-campus 
organization provides students with 
informal recreation classes and for-
mal classes to fight the flab and meet 
new people. All classes provided are 
located on campus and are typically 
around $100 for about 10 sessions 
during the quarter.

“With over 100 sports facilities 
here on campus,” Crowe-Lerma said, 
“There’s really no reason not to be 
active.”

Recreation also provides oppor-
tunities for students to be one 
with nature through its Outback 
Adventures, which includes backpack-
ing, white water rafting and horseback 
riding trips such as a camping trip to 
Joshua Tree. These trips are a little on 
the pricey side, but if you don’t mind 
dropping a couple hundred dollars for 
an amazing experience in the wilder-
ness, Outback Adventures would be 
your best choice.

Intramural sports such as beach 
volleyball and dodgeball offer  alter-
natives to working out at the gym. 
Another option is to join one of the 
various sports clubs and represent the 
Tritons. These clubs include not only 
your traditional sports, such as soccer, 
volleyball and water polo, but are also 
not-as-traditional sports such as danc-
esport, cycling and sailing.

There are also recreational dance 
clubs available for the less sporty. 
With beat-dropping hip hop groups, 
such as Ascension and 4n01, and 
cultural dance clubs, such as Chinese 
Dance Association and Da Real 
Punjabiz, UCSD remains diverse even 
within its physical activities.

Students can also sign up for 
dance classes (TDMV 1) like ballet, 
contemporary and jazz, ranging from 

beginner to advanced classes. Sign up 
through WebReg and shake what your 
mama gave you; working toward your 
GEs has never been more fun.

And finally, the simplest solution 
in three easy words: Hit the gym. 
With two, large, indoor facilities on 
opposite ends of the campus, UCSD 
has provided easy access for students 
to break a sweat for free. It’s easy to 
get bogged down with the stress of 
classes and extracurricular activities 
so sometimes working out will be the 
last thing on your to-do list, but mak-
ing simple, healthy changes is essential 
to fighting off the freshman 15. 

“Even just simply walking to class 
instead of taking the shuttle [or] tak-
ing the stairs,” The Zone’s marketing 
intern Natalie Wong said. “Just little 
things. They may not seem like much 
when you’re doing it, but it really does 
add up.”

In order to keep off the freshman 
15, many programs on campus sug-
gest not only exercising and watching 
what you eat, but also maintaining 
overall balance.

“It’s not about starving yourself, 
because a lot of students think ‘Oh, 
dieting’... but actually that’s worse,” 
Wong said. “It’s all about balance — 
balancing your diet, balancing your 
life, and making time for yourself 
and to exercise. Those are the things 
that also help with stress, and stress 
can affect your eating habits and your 
sleeping schedule too. Eating isn’t the 
only thing that affects the weight that 
you gain or lose.”

With so many different options, 
choosing an activity to ward away the 
freshman 15 can be a daunting task. 
But with programs ranging from rec-
reational class to free programs at The 
Zone, everyone is able to find what 
works best for them.

brochures rattle on about the fan-
tastic study abroad opportunities at 
UCSD. Your uncle gets starry-eyed 
as he reminisces about the night he 
managed to find himself at the top 
of the literature building wearing 
nothing but a horse mask. But what 
seemingly no one warns you about 
is what defines these “golden years” 
for many of us.

You’re away from home for the 
first time, starting from scratch with 
your social scene and under pres-
sure to figure out what you want to 
do with your life. You’re surrounded 
by some of the brightest and most 
competitive students in the nation 
and you can’t help but feel like 
you don’t measure up. Some of us, 
between the parties and the club 
meetings, get caught up in existen-
tial malaise. Who are we? What are 
we doing? What’s the point of it all?

The thing about depression, or 
any kind of mental illness, is that 
until you’ve experienced it, you 
don’t know what it’s like. My own 
freshman year was defined by my 
experience with depression and my 
inability to talk about it. Looking 
back, I can probably say that my 
unhappiness was attributed to a 
mix of a drastic change of environ-
ment, a discrepancy between what I 
thought college would be and what 
it ended up being and a genetic pre-
disposition to depression. If you’re 
going through anything similar to 
what I went through, you probably 
know why the “what is there to be 
sad about” line of questions is so 
unhelpful — not even scientists 
can exactly pinpoint the causes of 
depression.

We live in a culture that both 

glorifies depression and stigmatizes 
it. We talk about how brilliant Kurt 
Cobain was, and his suicide adds 
a mystique and implies a certain 
“truth” to the depressive outlook. 
Academia falsely insists that we’re 
depressed because we’re smart. 
Yet at the same time, we dismiss 
people’s existential qualms as “first 
world problems.”

What you feel is not you being 
crazy or selfish. If you’ve been feel-
ing disconnected for a while, get 
help. You’ll feel sheepish making 
that first CAPS appointment, but 
sometimes it takes only one ses-
sion with a professional to figure 
out what you need to do to get out 
of that funk. Sadness is a feeling, 
not a logical reasoning that comes 
from being smart. Keep up lines of 
communication; calling your friend 
and asking them to lunch can be 
enough to lift your spirits consider-
ably. Research shows that exercis-
ing can be a very effective way of 
treating depression, as can adopting 
a healthy diet. Don’t add another 
dimension to your emotional strug-
gle by worrying about your depres-
sion. Getting told time and time 
again that these are the best years of 
your life puts pressure on students 
to be happy all the time, when that 
simply isn’t the case. Life goes on 
for a while after college, and the 
best years are just ahead.

I’m thankful to say that by 
adopting healthy habits, taking up 
meditation and reaching out to 
friends and family, I overcame what 
was the hardest and loneliest year 
of my life. I rewarded myself by 
getting the letters “ttsp” tatted on 
my wrist. It’s reminder of the most 
important advice I’ve ever heard: 
“this too shall pass.”

him a writer who’s writing ‘Seven 
Psychopaths’ — it’s an easy conclu-
sion to make. But I also share Colin’s 
character’s view of violence in films 
and his desire to explore a way that 
films can be equally about love and 
peace, and still be cool.”

The story-within-a-story method 
has marked much of McDonagh’s 
work, including his beloved 2003 
play “The Pillowman,” which was 
also about a writer’s (decidedly more 
grisly) relationship with his stories.

“I kind of see this as a film 
equivalent to what I was trying to do 
in ‘Pillowman,’” says McDonagh. “But 
I’ll probably leave that style of story-
telling alone for now. I’d like to just 

concentrate on the stories in their 
own right, achieving something pure. 
Did you see ‘The Master’ yet? I loved 
that. It was something so pure — not 
tricksy — and meaty. That’s the kind 
of film I’d like to work on next.”

Aside from its labyrinthian twists 
and darkly comic take on the crime 
thriller, “Seven Psychopaths” is most 
notable for its incredible ensemble 
cast for which McDonagh cherry-
picked some of American indie 
cinema’s finest. In addition to Farrell 
and Rockwell, Woody Harrelson 
is brilliant as the film’s antagonist, 
Christopher Walken takes peyote and 
wanders a desert for the entire second 
half of the film, the great Tom Waits 
plays a serial killer-killer à la Dexter 
and “Precious”’ Gabourey Sidibe gets 

a handgun held to her head. 
Most exciting for McDonagh, 

however, was the prolific Harry Dean 
Stanton. 

“I couldn’t believe it — it was real-
ly just a matter of asking Harry,” says 
McDonagh. “I had dinner with him 
and he said ‘tell me what it’s about.’ 
So I did, and I got to the violence and 
he said, ‘ah I don’t really like violence,’ 
but when I told him what the twist 
was he said ‘oh well I’m really inter-
ested in all the eastern philosophies. 
I’ll do it.’ It was that simple [laughs]. 
Christ, this is just the dream for any 
kid who loves movies.”

While “Seven Psychopaths” 
will inevitably acquire McDonagh 
a wider mainstream fanbase, giv-
ing Tarantino a run for his money 

this awards season, those who’ve 
followed the writer’s past work will 
likely have one unresolved question. 
Last year, rumors began circulating 
that McDonagh and “Psychopaths” 
collaborator Tom Waits were work-
ing on a Broadway musical — a gin-
soaked folktale lover’s dream come 
true. 

“It kind of fell through,” admits 
McDonagh, “and it was pretty loose 
from the start. But I had so much 
fun working with Tom on this, and 
I’m in touch with him all the time. I 
might go ahead and write it and see 
if he wants to contribute. I certainly 
want to work with him again in some 
capacity anyway.”

Let’s hope the stars align for this 
one. 

  THe UCSD gUaRDIaN |   THURSDay, OCTObeR 4,  2012 |  www.UCSDgUaRDIaN.ORg  11Arts & EntErtAinmEnt

T he latest sonic foray from Flying Lotus, Until the Silence Comes, finds the preeminent 
sage of electronic hip-hop coping with 
a serious split personality. On the one 
hand, there is an ethereal presence in 
these songs. On “All In”, the very first 
cut off the album, harps gently trace 
vacillating curves. Electronically soft-
ened vocal samples from the likes of 
Thom Yorke and Erykah Badu shyly 
peer out of the psyched-out beats. 

Synth lines tentatively wander across 
entire tracks, like on “Dream to Me”, 
an entire song built on the synth’s 
gradual, gentle rise and fall. 

But FlyLo places this calm sensi-
bility at odds with drum loops that are 
both complex and breathless, lending 
a sense of urgency. Hi-hats, kicks and 
snares seem to be engaged in some 
kind of race, only loosely bound by 
the constraints of time signatures. The 
synth even morphs into a heavy, dub-
step womp on “Sultan’s Request.” 

The rest of Until the Quiet Comes 
is populated by FlyLo’s notori-
ously vast catalog of curious sampled 
noises. These sounds, whether from a 
maraca or a piece of sheet metal being 
vigorously shaken, are condensed 
and clipped, sounding rushed and 
incomplete as if fed through a vast 
and funky black hole. The coupling of 
what sounds like a chopped-up bird 
and Yorke’s ghostly voice on “Electric 

Candyman,” serves as the most dis-
tinctive (and rewarding) of this light-
vs.-dark approach.

Keep in mind that Steve Ellison, 
the man behind the (often literal) 
mask of Flying Lotus, is one of the 
leaders of the LA-based “beat music” 
movement, the protege of the late 
master J Dilla and the great-nephew 
of Alice Coltrane, the wife of jazz leg-
end John Coltrane. As in jazz, FlyLo 
makes busy, conversational songs that 
flirt with, but thankfully never cross, 
the threshold of chaos. True to his 
teacher, though, Ellison contains all of 
this sound within the familiar drum 
kit template of roots hip-hop. And it is 
in this very celebration of contradic-
tion that Ellison has left the landscape 
of hip-hop production more fertile 
than it has been in years.

opted to live in a triple will pay $9,698 
a year, plus $2,950 on dining dollars. 
That’s $1,405 a month, without 
factoring in fun expenses like the 
movies, going shopping or eating out 
at a restaurant. 

The final kicker is, you guessed it: 
Parking. When you live off campus, 
it is almost always guaranteed that 
your rent includes a couple reserved 
parking spots — after all, everyone 
needs access to a car in San Diego if 
they want to see farther than their 
front yard. But UCSD doesn’t see 
it that way — if you want your car 

on campus you will need to cough 
up $732 a year. Parking is not only 
expensive, it’s scarce. Of the 14,138 
parking spaces on campus, there are 
only 4,910 S spots. And UCSD isn’t 
working to increase this number 
— in fact, 133 S spots were actually 
eliminated in 2010. Parking is a huge 
deterrent to living on campus. If 
UCSD could lower the cost of student 
parking permits and increase the 
number of student parking spots, 
more students would be encouraged 
to return to on-campus living. 

In addition to lowering the cost of 
parking permits, Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality should re-evaluate many 

aspects of their budget with the sole 
purpose of making on-campus living 
more affordable. If dishwashing is a 
high expense, UCSD should look into 
getting rid of trays. Williams College 
in Massachusetts saved an estimated 
14,000 gallons of water annually 
since eliminating trays in one of their 
dining halls, according to Zilkha 
Center for Environmental Initiatives. 

UCSD is known for being an 
extremely innovative campus, so let’s 
find ways that we can channel that 
creativity into affordable student life. 
A four-year guarantee for housing 
won’t mean much until on-campus 
living becomes more desirable.

Halcyon Days By Christie Yi leTTeR TO THe ediTOR

Dear Editor, 
As the people who cook, clean and 

care for the students and the campus, 
the work we do is essential to the 
University of California’s ability to 
provide students with a world-class 
education.  Our work isn’t glamorous, 
but the purpose of our work is to 
support the students — our future — 
and we take real pride in that.  Today, 
we are engaged in a struggle with the 
UC administration over issues that 
affect us and our families deeply: 
retirement with dignity, wages and 
jobs that sustain us, and the ability 
to advocate for ourselves and the 
campus community that we serve.

At age 60, after 20-plus years 
of hard work, we will retire with 
permanent injuries, unaffordable 
healthcare and an average retirement 
income of $18,000 a year.  By 
contrast, UC President Mark Yudof 
can retire after just seven years of 
service to the UC system on more 
than $350,000 a year, with decreased 
health insurance costs.

We pay for our retirement benefits 
each month of our working lives so 
that we can afford to stop working 
when we are old, and we have 
foregone hefty raises for the promise 
of healthcare when our bodies are too 
broken to work.  The UC Regents, 
however, have proposed changes 
to these benefits that will leave us 
impoverished:  We would retire at 
age 65, well past the point of physical 
ability, and for some of us, the 
increased cost of our health insurance 
would exceed our monthly retirement 
income. Yet our risk of work-related 
injury is only increasing.

The UC system now hires fewer 
custodians, maintenance workers and 
gardeners to clean campus restrooms, 
fix the lights in classrooms, and 

make the campus clean and safe.  
The people who work for outside 
contractors, make poverty wages 
with no benefits and have no rights 
at work are increasingly doing these 
jobs.  This creates unsafe working 
conditions for us and poor conditions 
for UC students’ education. 

For this, students are paying higher 
fees, yet the training and research 
they do while at the UC system is 
the foundation for what is a highly 
profitable university system.  We 
think that the UC system can and 
should do better.

 The UC system is the third-largest 
employer in the state, impacts one out 
of 46 jobs in the state, and reported 
an increase of $414 million in net 
assets last year.  The University of 
California is an economic engine 
that can either help drive the state’s 
economy forward or help drag it 
down, but the administration is 
making further and deeper cuts 
to students’ education and our 
livelihoods. How will workers be able 
to retire if the UC system continues to 
cut our pensions?  How will students 
be able to earn their degrees if the UC 
continues to raise fees and cut classes?  
How will California recover and 
grow if the UC system’s workers and 
graduates are living in debt?

We ask that the campus community 
understand, as they see us on the 
picket line this year, that we are 
putting our greatest effort into 
reaching a fair agreement with the 
UC administration — one that 
honors our dignity, safety and 
livelihoods, and that can help to 
restore the excellence that students 
deserve and should expect from the 
University of California.

who’s unafraid to yell at his players, 
leaving hurt feelings to be dealt with 
by younger, more relatable assistant 
coaches.

It wasn’t until the start of the 
men’s soccer game that I saw the 
comical contrast in approach 
between McManus and UCSD 
Head Coach Jon Pascale. Flanked 
by assistants Eric Bucchere and 
Ryan Hernandez — two twenty-
somethings who wouldn’t look out 

of place in a UCSD uniform — the 
staff creates a much more mellow 
atmosphere during the pregame. 

In a voice that was never loud 
enough to be heard clearly from 
the scores booth, Pascale calmly 
outlined objectives before sending 
his players on the field. At the same 
time assistant coaches pulled play-
ers to the side, patting backs, giving 
individual advice to substitutes and 
defusing frustrated forwards.

Creating a climate of solidarity, 
where players aren’t intimidated by 

their coaches, seemed the superior 
strategy on Sunday. Pascale’s squad 
pulled strength from each other 
to extend their lead into the sec-
ond half, while the women seemed 
unable to gather the composure to 
pose an attack late in the game.

There will probably always be 
a place for “old-school” coaches, 
for as long as Vince Lombardi and 
John Madden are fixtures in the 
American consciousness. But for 
now it seems the new school is 
gaining groud.

We make the exam interesting while imparting 
the secrets to its mastery.

them to success,” Chang said. “This 
batch of underclassmen is composed 
and determined that nothing will get 
in our way.”

Chang placed third at last year’s 
Triton Invitational followed shortly 
after by sophomores Dani Brabender 
and Michelle LeRoux. Brabender 
placed third for the Tritons in 
Conference last year, just behind 
Michelle LeRoux who also garnered 
All-CCAA honors. Freshman Marie 
Diaz and Carolina Guzman have also 
posted top marks for UCSD. They 
took seventh and eighth respectively 
at the UCSD opener in August. This 
season, senior Elena Inouye returns 
to the roster after redshirting last year. 
Inouye is back into form, placing fifth 
overall at the Lancer Classic hosted by 
Cal Baptist last week.

The invite will be vital for Tritons to 
gain confidence against powerhouses 
Chico and San Francisco State, as well 
as Humboldt, CSU Los Angeles and 
Cal Poly Pomona.

16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Sitting in the stands at a UCSD Women’s Soccer game, you’re going to hear head coach Brian 
McManus before you see him.

When you finally catch sight of 
the man behind the Scottish bark, 
you’ll see the 26-year tenured coach 
alternately crowding the sideline to 
issue his marching orders, mulling 
over a bad pass or evaluating the 
referees...loudly.

Last Sunday, Sept. 30, if it wasn’t 
clear who won the matchup between 
CSU San Bernardino and UCSD, 
McManus made a point to clarify in 
his postgame interview.

“Teams are coming out and pres-
suring us, and we’re not handling 
the pressure. We’re too damn soft,” 
McManus said in UCSD’s official 
post game interview. 

In response to the followup — 
whether there is anything positive 
the team could take out of the loss 
— McManus replied, “Not really. 
Not really. At halftime I tried to be 
nice to them, I tried not to get into 
them. I thought they would play 
through it, but they needed their 
backsides kicked and they needed a 
wakeup call, and this was a big time 
wakeup call.” 

Granted, the loss was UCSD’s 
first of the season. But in the realm 
of college sports, the antics of a 
veteran coach — easily likened to a 
four-year old who lost his favorite 
toy — is not only acceptable, it’s 
celebrated.

However McManus is one of a 
dying breed, a so-called “old school 
coach” in the Vince Lombardi, Bob 
Knight, Mike Ditka fashion. A coach 

This weekend, UCSD will host the Annual Triton Cross Country Classic, Saturday Oct. 
6. 

The Annual Triton Cross Country 
Classic is a UCSD tradition 20 years 
in the running. The tournament 
plays host to strong Division I pro-
grams, including UC Irvine, Loyola 
Marymount and San Diego State. 

Traditionally, two weeks before the 
conference championships, the Triton 
Invitational serves as a gauge for who is 
healthy, who is ready to run and, more 
importantly, who has put in the neces-
sary work to step up big at the CCAA 
tournament. 

This year, the CCAA tournament 
will be held at UCSD. And the Triton 
Invitational is not simply a prepara-
tion for conference, but a legitimate 
measure of what, and whom, UCSD 
will deliver at the conference cham-

pionships on Oct. 20. The last time 
the Triton Invitational was hosted by 
UCSD was in 2006. The men fell third 
to distance powerhouse Chico State 
and Cal Poly Pomona. The women 
also finished third behind Chico and 
CSU Los Angeles.

This Saturday, the men will face 
competition in their 8k race against 
Cal Baptist, CSU Northridge, Christian 
Brothers, Concordia, Hawaii Pacific, 
Loyola Marymount, Marymount 
College, Orange Coast College, Point 
Loma, San Diego, San Diego Christian, 
Soka, Southwestern, UC Irvine and 
CCAA competitors in Cal Poly 
Pomona and CSU Monterey Bay.

Three juniors have taken up lead-
ership roles for UCSD. Junior Kellen 
Levy, who has been UCSD’s top runner 
in every meet he has competed in this 
season and was UCSD’s second-best 
runner last year at conference, leads 

the Tritons this season. Also clock-
ing strong times for the Tritons are 
juniors Mario Flores and Ben Rich. 
Flores, took the final scoring position 
for UCSD at conference, while Rich 
placed third of UCSD runners and 
18th overall last season.

Levy, Flores and Rich will be criti-
cal in pulling along underclassmen 
standouts freshmen Tareq Alwafai 
and Scott Acton. The two Tritons led 
UCSD at their last meet against Cal 
Baptist. The pair have been consistent 
all season. The men’s 8k will begin at 9 
a.m. this Saturday, Oct. 6.

The women begin their 6k at 9:45 
a.m., where UCSD hosts talent from 
Cal Baptist, Bakersfield, Northridge, 
Christian Brothers, Concordia, 
Hawaii Pacific, Loyola Marymount, 
Marymount College, Orange Coast 
College, Pacific, Point Loma, San 
Diego State, San Diego Christian, 

Soka, Southwestern, UC Irvine, UN 
Las Vegas and CCAA opponents from 
Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Los Angeles, 
CSU Monterey Bay and CSU San 
Bernardino. 

Last year, sophomore Chia Chang 
led the Tritons and finished seventh 
overall in the CCAA. She has con-
tinued to dominate the field, and still 
hasn’t fallen behind any UCSD runner 
in her past nine races. 

“I feel [the Triton Classic] is a great 
opportunity for us and me to get a 
glimpse of the competition of the actu-
al conference course,” Chang said. “It 
will be similar to a warm up, before 
the real deal.”

Chang said that the Tritons have a 
strong group of runners in 2012.

“We have a very young and talented 
team in which I am confident to lead

Tritons Prepare for CCAA Road Trip

Men’s soccer woMen’s soccer

After taking two shut-out wins last weekend, the UCSD Men’s Soccer 
team now sits at the top of the 
CCAA conference standings. The 
Tritons, at 5-1-2 overall, will be tak-
ing a trip up north to Sonoma State 
this Friday, Oct. 5.

With only one game this week-
end — the Humboldt State Men’s 
Soccer team was discharged from 
participation in the 2012 season —
UCSD Head Coach Jon Pascale will 
be able to exhaust his players. 

The Tritons will need to field 
their best 11 against the Seawolves, 
who are tied for the first position 
in the CCAA North. But Sonoma 
State—a perennial powerhouse in 

Division II Men’s Soccer— seems 
to be in the middle of a slump. The 
Seawolves’ last win was two weeks 
ago against Cal Poly Pomona, a 
1-0 victory at their home field. 
Since then, Sonoma State fell 
to Chico State before settling 
for two 1-1 ties against CCAA 
North Division opponents CSU 
Stanislaus and Chico State.

Conversely, the Tritons 
have yet to concede a loss in 
seven games.

A win this weekend would 
put UCSD solidly at the top of 
the standings, and would make 
UCSD a very serious contender 
in the postseason race.

Last weekend, the UCSD Women’s Soccer team saw its first set of blemishes 
on their formerly untarnished 6-0 

record. 
 Last Friday, Sept. 
28, the Tritons drew with 

CSU Dominguez 
Hills 1-1. The fol-

lowing Sunday, Sept. 
30, UCSD saw a 1-0 overtime loss 

to CSU San Bernardino.
 The Tritons remain at the 

top of the CCAA South Division 
standings, but have been overtak-
en by Sonoma State in the over-
all standings. Although the Tritons 

have secured a two-game lead over 
south division opponents CSU 

Los Angeles and CSU San 

Bernardino, this weekend’s matchup 
will likely serve as a precursor to the 
CCAA conference championships.

Along with No. 10 CSU Stanislaus 
and No. 17 UCSD, Sonoma State is 
currently the only other team in the 
CCAA to be ranked nationally. With 
a 9-1 record, the Seawolves are ranked 
No. 13, four spots above the Tritons, 
who fell in the rankings after last week-
end’s poor performances.

The Tritons are also slated to face 
Humboldt State. The Lumberjacks fell 
under a three-game suspension for 
the same infraction that cancelled the 
Humboldt Men’s Soccer team’s season.

Humboldt State has only won one 
of their six games in 2012, and are 
currently ranked at the bottom of the 
CCAA standings.
