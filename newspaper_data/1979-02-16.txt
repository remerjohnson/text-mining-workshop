balloonist. the Daycare campaign has " still 
failed to make it clear that Daycare parents did 
not write this referendum," Committee for 
Decent Daycare Publicity Director Victoria 
Brown says. 

" People are asking questions thatimply we' re 
trying to pull something off," Brown says, " or 
hide something." 

Brown blames the " confusing" nature of the 
referendum and the tactics of Daycare 
opponents (or the problems she says the 
Daycare supporters are having getting their 
message across. 

She believes that students are so confused by 
the referendum that they are not putting in the

n OpiniJ 
baycare is "Profitable to Society" 

Editor: 
Students at UCSD are about 

to vote on an important issue-
daycare. No doubt students to 
whom daycare is not a concern 
may find the issue tiresome, 
but it is of crucial importance to 
many students and to our own 
definition of ourselves as a 
community. It is . especially 
important, in view of the 
misleading and rancorous 
arguments being put forth 
against daycare parents, that 
students try to get a full and 
reasoned view of the issue. 

I would like to answer some of 
the attacks on daycare and to 
say, briefly, why it is of value 
and should be supported. 

students pay reg fees , and those 
fees go (or a variety of services . . 
Daycare took only .6 percent of 
the budget this year. For most 
parents, daycare is one of the 
few reg fee services they use -
they rarely get a chance to 
utilize the other services. As the 
Chancellor himself said last 
year, "The parents have a point 
- they pay their reg fees." 

Is UCSD's daycare center a 
"cadillac?" As the Chancellor 
acknowledged last year, it is at 
least as economical as other 
public centers. The only way to 
do it cheaper is to pay 
minimum wages and/or have 
such · a poor adult/child ratio 
th(lt the center loses its State 
Department subsidy (and low-
income parents lose their 
daycare) . 

something it has been hindered-
from doing till now because of 
the struggle to stay a live and to 
maintain day-to-day opera-
tions. 

Surveys show at least 600 
families on campus in need of 
childcare. Ninety percEmtofthe 
mothers on the Center's long 

waiting list are not in school 
because they cannot find or 
afford outside childcare. 

As U.C . ·s systemwide 
childcare consultant recently 
said, if one gets the full picture 
on daycare, one will see that it 
is a socially profitable 
enterprise. The more informa-

"Lack of 

tion one gets, the more likely 
one is to suppOrt childcare. 
Please consider the infor-
mation. Talk to parents at their 
information tables. Don't be 
misled by narrowminded, 
demagogic attacks that Simply 
ignore or distort the facts.

Is daycare welfare? It is no 
more welfare than public 
education itself. subsidized by 
taxpayers, many of ' whom 
never reap its benefits directly. 
Daycare is a form of financial 
aid, recognized as a means of 
broadening the representation 
of various societal groups 
within the university: It is well-
established that daycare is 
profitable to society - it keeps 
people off welfare, gives them 
educational tools to better 
themselves and contribute to 
society. At the university 
daycare helps set community 
standards a nd provides a 
resource center for early 
childhood education. 

Are Reg Fee funds ap-
propriate to subsidize the. 
center? Yes, for the simple 
reason that without them. at the' 
present time, the center's fate 
would rest solely with the 
administration . Although it 
c ould probably find the 
relatively small sum needed, it 
quite likely would not. In order 
to obtain the State Department 
of Education subsidy which 
allows low-income students to 
use the center, some UCSD 
subsidy is needed. At this point, 
it is up to students. If the Center 
is maintained. it (and students 
at large) will have a base from 
which to seek other funds.

Editor: 

When friends of mine learn

surprised that I did not attend

the following clipping that aptly 
expresses my sentiments: 

"One day, Leland Stanford 
Sr. and his family were given a 
tour of Washington by the 
President. Never one to be out-
done, Leland asked the three 
what each would most Ii ke in all 
the world. Mrs. Stanford 
requested diamonds, so Leland 
invested in So. Africa and thus 
provided her with a never 
ending parade of the glittering 
jewels. The President re-

quested a united country so 
Leland built him the trans·

Leland requested a Mickey

To the Student Body and

The dedsion by Howard Hunt 
to remove John Cates as

the best interests o{ the

have worked closely with John 
Cates through Intramural and 
Recreational Activities and 
know that he ha given every 
possible effort to improve the 
quality and efficiency of the 
administration of the pro-
grams. This action by Hunt 
seems to be one of complete 
lack oC understanding of how 
well Recreational Activities is 
{unctioning. 

This lack of understa nding, 
however, is not entirely the 
fault of Howard Hunt, (even 
though in our four years of 
working for Recrea tional 
Athletics we have not even once 
glimpsed Hunt in the recreation 
offices), but rather that of the 
administration of the P. E .

as well ' as lack of personal

This failure in communication 
reinforces the systematic gap 
,be~ween the two facilities and 
promotes a climate of 
administrative conflict. 

Hunt cites " administrative" 
differences between Cates and 
himself as the crux of the 
reason for th e dismis sa I. 
Inquiring into the definition of 
these "a dministrative " 
differences with HO'nt resulted 
in a rhetorical justification 
characte rized by personal 
conflict and disagreements 
over budget expenditures. We 

feel these difficulties are 
promoted through the dichotic 
system of the department. John 
Cates, in "causing " the e

McBride's Allegations 
"Smear" Daycare 
Editor: 

Scott McBride, oC the so-
ca lled I'Justice in Spending 
Committee." needs to be called 
to account. His manipulation of 
figures out of context to 
discredit the Daycare Center is 
typical of last-minute smear 
campaigns. Perhaps just as 
typical but more reprehensible 
are McBride ' s desperate 
efforts, through innuendo and 
s lander, to create an im-
pression that the Center's 
director and st~f are dishonest) 
and ripping off student funds . 
This is an insult to overworked, 
sacrificing people. 

As reported in 'the Guardian, 
last year's audit , a regular

Daycare staff often worked 
more hours than they reported 
to keep the Center going. 

But such factual matters oC

no use to McBride. He goes on to 
claim Center personnel are 
" fanatical about maintaining a 
shroud of secrecy" about 
budget figures. They must be 
crazy, too, since those figures 
are also matters of public 
record - the Daycare 
Information Board, the Reg 
Fee Committee, etc., have 
them. 

What MCBride doesn ' t 
mention is that he went to the 
Center "in a s hroud of 
secrecy," falsely claiming to

State Senate Wan.ts to 
Abolish 'Tahoe Commission 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The state Senate 
embarrassecl Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. in 
negotiations with Nevada by voting yesterday to 
abolish a regional .agency that regulates 
development on the California side of Lake 
Tahoe. 

The chief legislative opponent of the move 
called it an "unmitigated disaster" and 
predicted it would weaken CallCornia's position 
in negotiations over toUjlher environmental 
controls for the lake. 

"It obviously does not make my task in 
discussioDS with Nevada any easier," said Sen. 
John Garamendi, D-Walnut Grove. 

Yesterday's vote approved an amendment to 
a Geramendi bill that would ratify a tentative 
agreement between CaUfornia ~d Nevada 
strengthening environmental controls at the 
Sierra Nevada lake. 

A vote on the bill was put ocr until later, 
possibly today . 

The agreement, adopted last year by Brown 
and then-Nevada Gov. MikeO'Callaghan, would 
ban most new Tahoe casinos and weaken the 
power of local representatives on the Tahoe 
Reiional Planning Agency . 

The pact appeared to signal an end to years of 
disagreement between the two states over how 
to restructure the TRPA, a bistate board which 
rules on development on both sides of the lake. 

But the agreement, which must be ratified by 
Californ ia and Nevada legislators and 
Congress, ra'n into opposition in Nevada, 
prompting negotiations between the two 
legislatures. 

The amendment, adopted 20-17, would abolish 
the CTRP on Jan. I , 1980, if · California 
approves the Garamendi bill, SB 82. 

INTERNATIONAL 
US Readies 'Massive' Iranian Airlift 

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - The United States 
readied helicopters and big jets yesterday for a 
massive ai.rlift of thousands of Americans from 
Iran, where anti-Americanism is running high 
and the antishah revolutionary a lliance is 
splintering into hostile factions. . 

Bloody fighting raged for the third straight 
day in the northwest city of Tabriz, where. 
hundreds were reported killed. Unconfirmed 
reports said rebels seeking local automony were 

battling forces of the provisional government of 
Ayatolla h Ruhollah Khomeini. 

In Tehran, Marxist gunmen attacked a n 
apartment building where they said agents of 
SAVAK , the shah's secret service, were holding 
out. These " urban guerrillas" have rejected 
Khomeini 's call to turn in their arms, 
distributed or stolen during last weekend's 
'bloody climax to th.e year-long anti-shah 
campaign. 

Taiwan Diplomats to GO . Corporate 
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -Taiwan will go along 

with U,S. plans to handle relations between the 
countries through private corporations , 
officials announced Thursday. But they stressed 
their corporation will have close government 
ties. 

James Soong, director of Taiwan 's 
information office, announce that Taiwan was 
creating the Coordination Council for North

Blumenthal: Bad Economic Year Ahead 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Thenation's economy 

probably will sink into a mild recession this 
year, with rising unemployment and an inflation 
rate stuck at a high level through 1980, a group of 
the nation's top business leaders said Monday. 

Even as the Business Council issued its 
pessimistic economic forecast, the government 
reported that industrial ,output increased only 
0.1 percent in January, the smallest amount in a 

year. 
" I think the price of oil will go up for all kind 

of reasons aDd should go up so that we conserve 
more ," Blumenthal said in a television 
interview. 

In its economic forecast , the Bus iness Council 
did not use the word_ recession but ,'eferred 
instead to " a mild setback" for the economy 
that will last over several quarter of the year.

SACRAMENTO (AP).- Ed Clark, who made 

a strong showing as Libertarian candidate for

Some critical national problems are too important to be influenced by profit pr politics. 

This is the reason for the creation of The Aerospace 
Corporation, a not-for-profit company that is part of neither 
industry nor government. 

That detachment allows Aerospace to hold scientific and 
technical considerations foremost in applying technology and 
science to solve critical national problems. To preserve 
objectivity, no manufacturing is performed by Aerospace. 

Instead, The Aerospace Corporation is a unique science and 
research source, performing systems planning , systems 
engineering, technical direction and experimentation for several 
National Security agencies.

Unemployment, Recession Ahead Guthr"e Here 
Russell Says Teal11ster 'Dumbest, Most Patriotic' Janet Guthrie, the first 

woman to compete in and 
finish the Indianapolis 500, 
will discuss her racing career 
next week in a lecture being 
held in Mandeville Audi-
torium. 

By Randy Col 
A substantial rise in 

unemployment and a marked 
slow-down in economic growth 
await us by early 1980, 
according to Dr. Robert Russe U, 
Deputy Director of the Councll 
on Wage and Price Stability. 

Speaking to 70 students in the 
Mandeville Suite recently, the 
UCSD economics professor 
outlined some of the basic anti-
inflation · strategies and 
expected results of his work 
with the CWPS. 

Russell emphasized that the 
core of President Carter's 
program is "a marked slow, 
down of the economy through 
stringent fiscal and monetary 
restraint. .. The most publicized 
of the council's programs are 
the " Pay and Price" standards 
calling for voluntary restraint

from firms and workers in 
keeping wage and price 
increases below seven percent, 
he said. 

Russell noted that an 
economic slow-down inevitably 
mea'ns a 'n increase in 
unemployment, pointing out 
that the cost of diminishing 
inflation by 1 percent using 
monetary and fllCal policy 
alone is equivalent to 
"throwing two mllUon people 
out of work (or two years." 

Another concern of the -
Council is a massive re-
evaluation of social and 
economic regulations . Social 
regulation ' - enacted (or

keep costs down because it is 
private money being lost. 
Russell advocates regulatory 
reforrnr starting with massive

Citing self-fulfilling ex-
pectations on the part of both 
business and workers as a 
prime cause of inflation. 
Russell explained the difficulty 
in slowing inflation using only 
fiscal and monetary policy once 
inflation has gained mo-
mentum, as is currently the 
case. 

When asked the chances for 
the council 's success in 
reduci ng inflation , R usse l\ 

replied that assuming the 
Teamsters and autoworkers 
follow the petroleum workers' 
lead in accepting the 7 percent 
"Pay and Price" standards, 
"it's a 50-50 chance that the 
program will work." 

Russell said the autoworkers 
have already expressed their 
willingness to comply. The 
Teamsters will come in under 
seven percent he predicted, 
because competition from non-
union truckers is increasing 
and Teamster's Union Presi-
dent Frank Fitzi mmons is the 
" dumbest a nd most patriotic 
union leader in America ." 
Nothing like an inside view.

Black Belt Alden Numa throws unfortunate opponent. 

AII·-Cals Ahead for Judo 
A seldom heard about UCSD 

team of ten members is 
currently preparing for two big 
upcoming competitions. 

The judo team, under the 
direction of judo master 
(sensei) Ben Tsuji a seventh 
degree red and white belt, will 
travel north to Berkeley this 
weekend to compete in the 
Western Collegiate Judo 
Championships and the Judo 
All-Cal. 

"This year we have one of the

best teams ever," commented 
Ron Schaefer, a Warren 
College junior and black belt 
holder. " We may even be able 
to win the All-Cal." ·Last year 
the team placed third in the 
event. UC Irvine has 
dominated competition for the 
past thre years with a team 
boasting even black belts. 

The Triton squad has three 
black belt members: Schaefer.

Cagers 
Defeated 
In 4 Games 

By Joy Reardon 
The women 's basketball 

team played four games within 
five days last week, losing them 
all in score, but winning in 
experience a nd teamwork. 
Their grueling schedule pitted 
them against four of their 
previous challengers, playing 
each team lor the second and 
final time this year. 

Last Friday in a hard fought 
team effort against USJU, the 
Tritons lost, 74-49 . Never-
theless, Coach Judy Malone 
was encouraged. " We played 
thirty minutes of good offense 
and defense. If we had just held 
on for ten more minutes we 
could have had them." 

The next night the team 
traveled to UC Irvine for a 
demoralizing contest, losing 76-
37. 

Monday the Tritons hea,ded 
into a clo match-up against 
Pt. Loma after a day of rest on 
Sunday . 

The conte t w nt down to the 
wire with UCSD losing in the 
final five seconds. 62-55. 

The women are coming to the 
conclu sion of th ir " lea rning"

contests before the All -Cal 
tournament at Riverside

Recreation Director John 
Cates, a nine year veteran of 
the UCSD PE Department, was 
relieved of his position last 
week by PE Department'Chalr 
Howard Hunt and returned to a 
full-time teaching schedule. 

In the past year and a half as 
Recreation Athletics director, 
Cates created the Outdoor 
Recreation program , dras-
tically increased the amount of 
RA clubs and supervised the 
growing Intramural Sports 
program. 

Chuck Millenbah, a Physical 
Education supervisor and head 
of the Aquatics program here, 
was named as Cates' re-
placement. 

Cates learned of his dismissal 
Feb . 8 in a telephone 
conversation with Hunt. 
According to Cates, Hunt 
commended him for being a 
" very good teacher," con-
istently getting one of the 

highest student ratings in the 
department , amf for doing a 
good job as Recreation 
Di rector . He then told Cates he 
was b ei ng replaced an d 
dil'ected him to move out of his 
office by the end of the day. 

Hunt has announced that he 
will draft a directive withhin 
the next few days concerning 
exactly how the progra m 
should be run. Should Cates 
accept these provisions, the RA 
job will be his once more. The 
dire ctive will "s pell out 
everything so there will be no 
misunders tandings ," said 
Hunt. 

Basically, Hunt intends to 
work out the budget for the 
Recreation program, taking 
that power away from the RA 
director. 

Hunt said that budgetary 
conflicts between he and Cates 

were part of the reason for 
Cates' dismissal. Asked by 
Cates for specifics, Hunt 
related three to him. 

First, he cited Cates' delay in 
replying to a letter from a 
University of Illinois student 
about the - UCSD program, 
calling the response a "top 
priority." 

Second, Hunt reprimanded 
Cates for requesting a faculty 
meeting about some interna l 
department problems that 
disturbed Cates. Hunt said that 
calling meetings was his jop, 
not Cates '. 

Finally, Hunt said that Cates 
questioned too many 'adminis-
trative matters regarding PE 
'and RA . 

Cates, however, expressed 
little surprise about his 
dismissal. Alter Hunt sent a 
memo ordering him to expedite 
the Illinois letter, Cates " saw 
the handwriting on the wall . I 
mentioned to Mike Hipp (a n RA 
assistant supervisor) that I 
might not be around here long, " 
he sa id. 

Cates later sent Hunt a memo 
explaining that a response was 
in the making, but not top 
priority for his staff. Cates said 
this incident only exacerbated 
the growi ng chasm between PE 
and RA. 

The faculty meeting Cates 
wanted concerned the declining 
morale of junior PE super-
visors because they were not 
invited to three quarters of the 
departmental meetings . Also, 
he wa nted to discuss the 
problems of computer regis-
tration for classes. Hunt , 
howev e r , seve rely repri-
manded him for the memo. 
Supervisor Barry Cunningham 
later wrote a counter-
state men t, asking for a 
meeting of supervisors himself.

I rvine's Steve Scott 
Eyes World ·Record 
'Maln Goal Is Moscow Olympics 

By Henry DeVries 
Staff Wrl&er 

When what has been dubbed 
as " the best indoor mile field in 
track and field history " 
attempts to break the world 

, indoor record tonight at the 
Jack In The Box Invitational , 
the hope of America will be 
riding on the shoulders of a 1974 
graduate from UC Irvine. 

His name is Steve Scott a nd 
he is the best miler the U.S. has 
to orter. 

" It ma kes me feel good to be 
recognized as the American 
hope ," s aid Scot.t. " Any 
pressures put on me I feel in a 
posit ive way." 

Scott will square off tonight 
at the Sports Arena against 
Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland. 
Jotn Walker of New Zealand, 
Wilson Waigwa of Kenya .. and 
Filbert Bayi of Tanzania. The 
field eas ily has the credential 
to break th world indoor mile 
mark of 3: 54 .9. The world 
record of3: 49 is held by Walker. 

' 'I'd love to be in a race where 
everyone wants to lead," sa id 

Scott. He knows that the fans 
will be looking for the record. 
Although trac.k is an amateur 
sport, Scott believes that they 
should still aim to please. 

Scott gained natIOnal 
prominence at the 1977 Jack In 
The Box Invitational with his 
surprise second place finish 
and personal best indoor time 
of 3: 56.5. The winner that year 
was Waigwa with a 3:55 .7. 
Close behind Scott was 
Coghla n, who came back to win 
the event in 1978. 

Scott, who is the NCAA and 
AAU cham pion, still trains with 
the UCI track team. He is 
currently supporting himself 
with savings and a little help 
from his parents. His goal is the 
Moscow Olympics in 1980. 
Right now he is just having "a 
lot of fun " running . 

"In any other sport you're not 
going to get to travel 
internationally like you do in 
track ," stated Scott . Where 

lse, stated Scott, would 
someone pay for a trip to Tokyo 
or Moscow "just so you could 
run for four minutes."

Track' Men Drop Meet 
76-58, Coach S-till Pleased 

Las t Saturd ay ' S season Doug Cae ar and Keith Hill John Serrano shone for the 
opener for the men's track 
team was not as successful as 
the women's , non etheless 
Co ac h Andy Skief was 
" pleased " with the results. The 
Tritons dropped the meet to 
Claremont-Mudd. 76-58 . 

UCSD's first place wins were 
well distributed with the 
expected strength surfacing in

Triton spikes volleyball to Loyola-Marymount opponent in 
"best game of the season." 

Volleyballers Haven't 
A Prayer, Lose 3-1 

HY Stephen Nagler 
The Triton Men's Volleyball 

Team bowed to viSiting Loyola 
Marymont, 3-1 Wednesda i 
night. 

UCSD appeared to be in for a 
long evening after Loyol~ 
quickly opened a 13-3 lead in 
game one. The Tritons called 
time-out and then notched the 
next 6 points, before grudgingly 
gOing down in a 15-9 defeat. 

The Tritons continued to play 
well at the outset of game two, 
jumping out to an early 5-1 
advantage . At. this point , 
Loyola began to play up to their 
NCAA Division I status. They 
outscored UCSD 14 to 6 on 
their way to a 15-11 triumph. 

Loyola had taken 3 straight 
games from the Tritons earlier 
this season. With a 4-0 surge in 
the opening moments of the 
third game, a repeat sweep 
appea red imminent. 

But the Tritons, led by 
captain Steve Upp and the 
inspi red Hal J acobs, .fought 
back to tie the game at 4. a nd 
never trailed thereafter. The 
fina l read 15-11: UCSD. 

Triton Coach Doug Dannevik 
desc ribed the third game 
victory as " by- far our best 
ga me of the season. The 
co mbinatiol'\ of improved 
passing, timing and hu tie, • 
fina lly tarted to pay off," he 
a dded. 

With the momentum of a 
victory a nd the crowd of one 
hundred or 0 solidly behind 
them, the Tritons entered game 
four. 

Loyola opened the scoring. 
but UCSD moved ahead 2-1. It 
was the last time the Tritons 
would lead, as Loyola opened 
up marg ins of 7-2 and 16-4, 
coasting to a 15-8 decision . 

For UCSD it was another 
c hane to sharpen their game 
against top quality opposition. 

Coach Dannevik had pral e 
for his entire team. " Weplayed 
better to ni ght than any 
previous time this season. I'm 

n ouraged as well a 

optimistic. If we continue to 
improve at our current rate, I 
see no reason why we shouldn't 
Qe challenging for a division 
playoff s pot. " 

The Tri tons get a n op-
portunity to make Coach 
Dannevik's claims look good 
tonight when they host division 
rival UC Riverside in the Main 
Gym . Play-begins at 7: 35.

Programs Created 
To Reflect 
Third-'s Goals 

By Reed Alpert 
Editor 

One of the outcomes of the 
emergence of Third College was 
the creation of interdisciplinary 
programs designed to carry into 
action the goals and ideals 
embodied in the Lumumba-
Zapata movement. 

The Lumumba-Zapata doc-
ument , released in May, 1969, 
stated, "Third College (must) be 
devoted to relevant education for 
minority youth and to the study 
of the contemporary social 
problems of ~ II people." 

The four programs that will be 
looked at here- Commun-
ications , Urba n and Rural 
Studies, Third World Studies and 

. Science and Technology- all 

contribute in a certain way to 
that aim. 

Communications 
Herb Schiller , former 

coordi-nator of the Commun:-
ication Program , identifies 
Communications "as an area 
that looks at the whole process of , 
consciousness, what went into 
forming consciousness." 

Commun ications can be 
conside red a double-pronged 
endeavor, he said, with the first 
prong being domestic com-
munications. The program must 
look at the represenwtion of 
minority groups in the media and 
ahow the mass medb serves 
those groups, Schiller said.

Black faculty member at UCSD Dean'sOfficewhoisstudyingthe

decided against including the 
name for fear that the fate of the 
proposed college would be

"They decided it was more 
important to get a concept of the

. Angela Davis, a noted Black 
political militant and a graduate

played an extremely influential 
role in the protest, according to 
Blanco. "The students looked up 
to her. She was a natural leader. 
But she submitted to collective 
decision-making as we all did. In 
this we were all equals." 

In he r autobiography, Davis 
says "I had been designated by 
the brothers and sisters to read 
the statement collectively drawn 
up ... . Along with our demands for 
Lumumba-Zapa ta College, we 
issued a very serious warning: in 
the event that the Chancellor 
refused to negotiate we would not 

. guarantee that the university 
would continue to function 
undisturbed.' , 

To d emonstrate (h e ser-
iousness of their demands, the 
students staged a takeover of the 
registrar's office some weeks 
after the drafting of their 
demands . " The university 
decided, apparently, that it was 
best to make the concessions we 
were demanding rather than risk 
a prolonged disruption of 
campus activities," Davis 
wrote. " To tell the truth, we had 
not really expected them to 
agree so readily to our notion of 
the third college." 

Prof~ssor Rappaport resigned 
in July of 1969 and was replaced 
by Dr. William Frazier. Frazier 
served as acting Provost until 
the following summer when 
Joseph Watson was named 
Provost at the age of 31. The

Provost, says that "the

Dean Beverly Varga .

Minority Enrollment

taken a special in

It's true. 

R.EDIT 
N'ION 

Another student noted that the 
number of whites makes Third 
" less appealing" and said she 
"had assumed there would be 
more minority students here." 

Watson and several Third ' 
students suggested that minority 
recruitment procedures con-
tribute to the small per~entage of 
non-white students a t Third . 

The Equal Opportunit y 
Program (EOP) is responsible 
for recruiting minority students 
to UCSD. Approximately half of 
all minority students at UCSD 
are enrolled at Third, according 
to Watson. 

Watson charged tbat the 
administration here " has never 
considered minority enroll-
ment seriously." 

Altbough the administration is 
" not opposed " to minority 
student enrollment, Watson said, 
Third receives only " courteous 
listening and no action" from 
them. 

Still , some students find Third 
attractive for minority students. 
" If it wasn' t for Third," said 
Third student Shirley Scott_ 
"there probably wouldn't be that 
many- minorities here (at 
UCSD)''' 

Academics at Third 
While minority student 

e nrollment has not fulfilled 
Third ' s expectations, many 
members of the Third com-
munity indicated their pleasure 
with its academic progress. 

" Our commitment to give a 
quality education has been met ," 
said Susan Montrose, As l. Dean 
at Third . " I'd like to think that 
one COUldn ' t go through (Third) 
without having one 's con-

. sciousness sharpened." 
Third senior Leslie DeBerry 

commented that Third provides 
_ stu'dents with " politi cally 

progressive and active pro-
grams." 

Villanueva believes that many 
UCSD students think academics 
at Third are "easier" than at the 
other colleges. He said, though, 
that many courses "are a lot 
tOOgher" than those a t Muir, 
Revelle, or Warren colleges. 

According to Varga. a higher 
percentage of Third students are 
accepted into medical school 
than at the other colleges. She 
added that a large number of 
Third graduates enter pro-
fessional and graduate schools. 

The programs at Third , said 
Montrose, are geared "to get 

minorities into a reas no t 
tra dition ally e ntered (by 
minorities)" with their acquired 
skills. 

About 47 percent of Third 's 
faculty are non-white and 
compri e roughly two-thirds of 
the total number of minority 
faculty members at UCSD . 

Villanueva said he was 
dissa tis fied with the faculty a t 
Third because "some of the best 
professors have been denied 
tenure. " 

While a campus-wide average 
of 70 percent ladder-rank faculty 
receive tenure at UCSD, only 48 
percent of ladder-rank facu lty at 
Third are tenured. 

Watson spoke of a " certain 
attitude" at UCSD he termed as 
" tokenism," 

"I'm concerned with token 
representation at Third ," he 
said. " One minority professor 
for each department is not 
sufficient.' , 

The comparatively low tenure 
rate at Third has produced a 
" neg ative impact" a mong 
faculty, accordi ng to Watson. 

"The specia l efforts they 've 
(Third faculty) undertaken are 
not being recognized," he 
remarked, adding that many 

potential faculty members are 
" frightened off" by poor tenure 
prospects at Third . 

Third as a Community 
Shirley Quan, a stud imt at 

Third, said she has noticed a 
" unity" among students at 
Third. 

" It ·s not ' peaches and cream' 
here ," remarked Watson, "but 
we 're more harmonious racially 
than the other colleges." 

But another Third student, 
Shannon Blue , com mented that 
" it's not very unified" at Third. 
"Mi norities keep to them-
selves," she sa id , "and whites 
don 't rea lly care." 

Approximately 75 percent of 
Third students a re commuters. 
DeBerry suggested that stud ent 
unity at Third is strongest among 
lower division students who live 
on campus. 

Room for Improvement 
Third College has advanced to 

a point where it has " made a dent 
in the un iversity" and has 
received community attention , 
according to Varga. 

"Third 's whole commitment is 
to growth and change," s he 
remarked. " I hope we never get 
to a point of satisfaction ...

In terms of accomplishing 
the goals of the program, 
Schiller says, "We were never 
able to do what we wanted to 
do." He feels, however, that the 
program has the potential to 
attain those goals, especially 
with the strong student support 
it has received. 

Schiller cite problems with 
obtaining enough resources 
and joint faculty appointments 
as'major problems.

A shorlilge of resources has 

plagued the program. Thomas

that some of the UCSD social

Pushing Moliere to 
Present at the Globe 

By William GlIIMn 
The Old Globe Theatre's 

production of Moliere's Tbe 
Misan&llrope rinishes its three-
week run at the Carter Center 
Stage this weekend, with shows 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
evenings. Tickets are $7.00 
each. 

Back in France's seven-
teenth "Century of Gold," 
Moliere 's plays were avant-
garde, when the word truly 
meant something; for Moliere 
it meant excommunication 
from the Church. In spite of 
their great popularity, his 
comedies pricked so many 
important consciences that he 
and his " ilIustre theatre" were 
orten in hot water with the 
powers-that-be. 

Moliere holds no truck with 
the pretensions of human 
beings, whom he apparently 
sees as vain, hypocritica l, 
spiteful busybodies which seek 
cheap gratification, with no 
regard for either the truth or 

each otber. Into the midst of an 
'1'11- scratch- your- back- you-
scratch- mine' world comes 
Alceste , Moliere's dubious 
hero, ranting at length on the 
hypocrisies of society, at the 
same time caught up with a 
whory bitch who couldn't care 
less for his moral struggles. His 
anguish, well if a bit 
ovenealously played by Clark 
Miller, is played against Rosina 
Widdowson-Reynolds ' Celi-
mene, with admirable affect. 

The play is a character 
study; its plot is subsidiary, 
which as it is also extremely 
silly. As In any psycho-analysis 
(to use the new lingo) , the 
character is I)!vealed in a 
series of small clues, expressed 
orally. in this case in little 
bursts of profound and/or witty

UCSD Student Studies 
Vietnam With a Camera 

By Jeff Spaulding 
Revelations, a photo show 

that ends today at the East 
Room of the Mandeville Center, 
is a collection of moving 
portraits and street scenes 
taken in Asia by UCSD student 
Ross Meador. The photographs 
came as a result of Meador's 
work as part of the Friends of 
Ch ildren program in Vietnam, 
South Korea and Sri Lanka as a 
social worker, documenting the 
lives of the people he 

~ncountered in his trave ls. 
Meador's works reve al an 

eye for scenes of emotional 
impact - hi variou portraits 
of orphuns . the e ld rly . 
pea a nt laboring in the fields 
and urban residents ex press his 
sensitivity and concern for his 
subjects . Unlike the co ld -
blooded approach of Diane 
Arbus, Robert Frank, Richard 
Avedon and oth r prominent 
contemporary photographer , 
M ador brings a lou h of 
humanitarianism to hi s work. 
Yet his photo are not as overtly 
didactic in approach as that of 
Jacob Riis and simila r fa mous 
socia l worker photographers. 

While he doesn 't hide their 
situation, Meador is not purely 
interested in presenting an 
exposee of poverty in Asia. His 
portraits have a certain grace 
and aesthetic quality ; his 
subj ects retain their innate 
human dignity in spite of their 
physical aff liction s a nd 
deprivations~ 

This is presented most 
powerfully in a series of photos 
Meador took at a compound 
called Phu My, a center where 
children and cripples were 
herded by the South Viet-
namese government. The 
compound hou es a bout two 
t hou sa nd peop le , t\ 'e lve 
hundred of them old and 
handi ca pp d. One photograph 
shows an old man, suffering 
from incredible malnut rition, 
(anning him ' elf. Other 
pl:otograph portray group of 
crippled chi ldre n undre sing 
them Iv to go wimming 
and UUng on toilet eat , their 
thin bodies lumping into the 
hoi . Throughout these images 
run the unseen horrors of wor, 
of poor and s ick people being 
pushed to the side because of 

Ole war, an unstable economic 
system, a corrupt government. 
Meador's intention isn't to 
overtly lecture or moralize. As 
he himself commented, the 
photos are meant "to show 
images of people who 've been 
stricken with incredible 
hardship, but who go on with 
their lives anyway. The photos, 
I guess, are my way of showing 
people how my own attitudes 
about life and death were 
changed. I hope I can share a 
little of that experience with 
others who haven't been to 
Vietnam." 

The photographs in Reve-
lations were shot with black 
and white film and, despite th e 
occasiona lover-exposed print 
an d poor resolution of images, 
are of generally good guality. It 
is an experience that puts one a 
bit more in touch with what it 
means to be human. Indeed , 
humanitarian va lues are re-
affirm d by the exhibition and 
the show more or less forces us 
to shed a lot of the cheap 
cynic is m and nonplu ssed 
attitudes that are so in fashion 
these days.

New .Byrds LP Fails in Spirit, 
Energy of Earlier Efforts 

By Barry Alfonso 
Blame it on nostalgia (or 

their better days - when I heard 
that three of the original 
members 0( the Byrds were 
recording an album together, I 
had my hopes that the energy 
and charm of that seminal '60s 
band could be recaptured. No 
such luck. McGuinn. Clark anc1 
Hillman (Capitol) is not a bad 
album, just an innocuous and 
highly Corgettable one. Most or 
the songs here by these rock 
veterans are, to alter a Byrds Ip 

title , " older than yesterday ," 
indistinguisha ble from the 
music that Firefall, Loggins 
and Messina, Poco and similar 
country rock ouUits have been 
releasing for years . The 
album ' s production is 
restrained, pleasant, laid-back 
to the point of somnolence; a 
few Latin guitar and piano 
touches spice things up ·here 
and there, but MeH 's 
arrangements are on the whole 
profoundly mundane. Gene 
Clark and Chris Hillman 

demonstrate why their solo 
careers never amounted to 
much - they write and sing 
passable pop tunes , musings on 
love and life's changes devoid 
of originality or color. Roger 
McGuinn fares a little better. 
His "Bye Bye, Baby" has a 
si ncerely sentimental feel to it· 
"Don't You Write Her Of(" is ~ 
vague echo of his once-magical 
Byrds style . McGuinn's 
contributions, though, aren' t 
enough to make this album 
deserve special attention. 

Updated Moli'ere a Mixed Ba'g 
(Coadnued from pale 12) 
result is a script loaded with 
such modernisms as "keep 
yo ur cool ," "naked ape," 
" horny" and others which I 
found a bit distracting, as they 
pop up amidst the most 
flatulent tirades. The rhyme 
does , however, provide for 
SCintillating banter, speeches 
which play with expectations, 
titillating with insinuation the 
not entirely jaded sensibility. 

Though the rhythm has been 
changed by Harrison from the 
French Alexandrine to the (not 
muc h) more wieldy pen-
tameter , the speeches remain 
sententious and difficult to 
handle. It is a tribute to this cast 
that they don 't get mired in the 
long speeches, or become 
horribly sing-songy in their 
delive ries. The actor must in a 
sense free himself from his 
speeches in order to avoid being 
a mere mouthpiece Cor his 
lines . He must dramatize his 
character to the point of 
car icature, so as not to be

swallowed by Moliere 'S words. 
Lary Youngsteadt pulls this orf 
admirably, huffing through his 
part, the stuffy and officious 
Oronte, with the aplomb of one 
long familiar with such 
theatrical clods . Matthew 
Redding is also outstanding as 
the twittering, languid Acaste. 
I found Nancy Thorsnes' the 
best; her low-key way of 
'delivery modulated, tempered 
and slowed the pace, keeping 
Miller's too enthusiastic antics 
from making the action too 
frantic . 

While the sententiousness of 
the speeches threatens to make 
The Misanthrope seem like a 
reading of Bartlett's Quota-
lion, the play is nonetheless 
worthwhile. As a study of the 
Idealist in conflict with himself 
and the world, I don 't believe 
it 's a play which can lose its 
validity. even or especially in a 
country whose President goes 
off grinning and grovelling 
whenever a trickle of black 
sli me comes bubbling out of the 
earth .

AS Votes to 
Endorse Daycare 

The AS Council approved 
Wednesday night a resolution 
endorsing a "yes" vote on next 
week's Daycare referendum, 
citing a "social responsibility" 
to the student body and daycare 
parent. as its justification. 

The resolution calls for 
continued runding and 
expansion or Daycare Center 
facilities . It passed the Council 
9-4-Z, with those opposed 
arguing that the registration 
fee committee can not afford 
the Daycare allocation. 

In other action Wednesday 
night, the Council: 
-approved (9-2-2) a resolution 
calling for a cafeteria boycott 
of Nestle's products because of 

Nestle baby bottle marketing In 
underdeveloped countries; 
- postponed consideration of 
budgets ror the new indicalOr, 
PoUljoumai and Voz Fron-
leliza, the subjects of last 
Wednesday 's heated Council 
debates ; 
- approved a new policy 
requiring Council members to 
summarize their duties and 
accomplishments during their 
term of office in a written 
statement to be submitted no 
later than February 26; 
- passed a resolution which 
"votes to include students at all 
levels of California gover· 
nance, including the area of 
academic policymaking."

$400 Spent In 
'Yes' Effort 
(Ce.u.ed ...... Ne I) 
opponents with often just " not having the facts 
right. " 

Even the stand of Daycare supporters has 
been confused, she says. "The referendum is not 
about the Daycare budget...it's about what the 
maximum limit that should be spent on it is," 
Brown says. . 

"We made a conscious decision to tell people 
to vote the maximum, but we recognize that the 
idea that the present Daycare Center should 
need $84,000 is ridiculous ... we see this as 
primarily a symbolic campaign," Brown says, 

Jim Skelley, the campaign coordinator for the 
committee, an experienced activist, says 
another "big roncern" of the committee is that 
" women students seem to have a better 
understanding of the issue than men. A lot of 
people are concerned .about how that will 
translate when people vote." 

Both Skelley and Brown, though, say the 
mechanics of the campaign are going well. 

Both Daycare parents and the campus 
community, Brown says, have volunteered time 
toward the referendum's passage, and she 
estimates about 50 people are working for the 
Committee. 

Over $400 in contributions have been received, 
Brown says, and almost all that is going into 
pamphlets a nd the yellow " Yes on Daycare" 
buttons sold a round campus. 

In addition to the more traditional campaign 
accoutrements, Skelley says that Mike 
Caldwell, " one of the principle balloonists in San 
Diego," will be hovering over campus sporting a 
"Yes on Daycare" sign Wednesday morning 
and afternoon, the first day of the referendum. 

Brown is pleased with her committee's 
ca mpaign effort, but says that when the Day 
Care Information Board postponed the election 
twice, once last quarter and once this quarter, it 
was "terribly harmful in terms of campaigning 
energy and effectiveness. Our posters don't 
even have the date printed on them because 
when we printed them, we didn't know when it 
was. "

expensive for them. 

McBride says that he Is in "sympathy" with 
the parents, but does not feel a social service 
such as daycare is a fuoction of the University. 

Rejecting comparisons between daycare and 
other Reg Fee funded sei-vices such as the Craft 

- Center and the Health Center, McBride says, 
"these services are worthwhile because they 
serve 'a large number of students and everyone 
can use them. The Daycare Center only has a 
particular number of slots for men and women 
in a particular situation." 

Daycare,' acconting to McBride, il not a rillit. 
"It's not like ramps for the handicapped," 

says McBride . . 'Without accelS tbe 
handicapped students could never go to school; 
the parents have other options." 

McBride suggests that if the Daycare Center 
was to close and parents were unable to find or 
a fford other means of daycare, the parents 
could delay their education. "Going to the 
University immediately is not the only way they 
(the parents) can grow as people," says 
McBride. 

An AMES major and Revelle student, 
McBride says that he became active in the 
daycare issue after first hearing about next 
week's referendum. 

McBride says that he and the other members 
of his group are upperclassmen " who have been 
around long enough to remember other special 
interest groups and their plays for a large 
portion of the registration fees." 

When he and his group heard about the 
referendum, according to McBride, they saw a 
chance W " voice their opinion. " 

McBride says that he and his group have spent 
about $400npostersrorthe~ampaignsofar, The 
money, he says, comes from contributions from 
members of the commi~tee. 

Daycare Debate Tuesday 
A debate over the pros and 

cons of the Daycare refer-
endum will be held Tuesday at 
noon in the North Conference 
Room of the Student Center. 
Victoria Brown of the 
Committee for Decent Daycare 
will debate Scott McBride. 

The debate will oCfer 
students a chance to hear two 
sides of the issue before going to 
the poll s Wednesday and 
Thursday to give their opinion 
on Reg Fee funding of the 
Daycare Center. The refer-
endum, which is advisory to the 
Reg Fee Committee, was 
mandated by Chancellor 
William McElroy last year 

when the Reg Fee Committee 
voted to fund the Center $25,000 
after 21 students were arrested 
during a sit-in in McElroy's 
office. 

The rererendum asks 
students at what level they 
would like to have, Reg Fee 
Fund the Center, at what 'level 
they would like to see Reg Fee 
fund an expanded Center, and if 
staff and faculty should be 
allowed to utilize the Center. A 
more detailed explanation of 
the situation is available in the 
voter pamphlets, which can be 
obtained at EDNA or the AS 
offices

of the testimony given was

Student Lobby Co-directo/'

. would influence many Regents 
i.lnd that it might "all be for

Regent Yuri Wada, hOWeVel'. 
said th"lt after hem'ing the 
te limony he felt the Regents 
could no longer " keel) silent." 

W ad:1 guessed that the 
Regents could take a stand on 
the conversion of the 
laboratories by as early as the 
next Regents ' meeting in 
March. He told Tltt' (:uardian

Cates Dismissed 
(Continued from {lag!' 6) 

Cate indicated his dismis al 
may have been a result of the 
generally poor relations 
between RA a nd the rest of the 
PE Department. "Part of the 
problem," said Cates, " is that 
we're Iioused in different 
buildings . Also, our starr is 
treated as second-class citizens 
by the PE department. 
. "Chuck Gormley. a full-
salaried worker, was asked to 
set up a conference room for a 

meeting he wasn't even invited 
to," Cate aid. " Our a i tant 
director of programs has to go 
out at seven in the morning and 
mark the fields for intra-
murals. This is unhealthy for 
department morale. " 

Shortly after Cate di -
missal, Hunt promi ed to allow 
RA employee to come to 
departmental meetings and 
announced a program to rotate 
RA em ployees into the main PE 
offices.
