Regents Ruling Evokes 
Varied UC IReactions 

The controversial ruling by 
the Board of Regents limiting 
guest lecturers to no more than 
one lecture per quarter has e-
voked an angry response from 
students and faculty throughout 
the UC system. 

Both the A.A. Senate and the 
Academic Senate of UCSD have 
passed resolutions censuring the 
Regents for their action. The 
A.S.resolution cites both the Cal-
ifornia legislature and the Re-
gents as being -ignorant of the 
prinCiples of academic freedom 
and incompetent in the handling 
of academic affairs.-

The UCSD Academic Senate 
passed a set of four resolutions 
that have already touched off a 
controversy on this campus. The 
four resolutions are as follows: 

1. The appearance Qf spokes-
man for significant social and 

political points of view in a.n 
experimental course dealing wiffi' 
the social problems of society 
today appears to us appropriate. 

2. Cases such as the Cle-
var case have raised the ques-
tion of outside speakers in Uni-
versity courses. This question 
should be dealt with by regu-
lations of the Academic Senate. 
We believe that it cannot be 
adequate) y resolved by rigidly 
restricting the appearances of 

outside speakers. 
3. The Board of Regents, 

almost fifty years ago, delegated 
authority over educational mat-
ters to the faculty. It is gen-
erally recognized that the sub-
sequent development of the Uni-
versity of California to become 
one of the outstanding institutions 
of higher learning in the world 
was in large measure a conse-
quence of the adoption of this 
policy. We consider the Regen-
tal rule restricting the. appear-
ances of outside speakers in 
University courses as objection-
able because it threatens this 
important cornerstone of the Uni-
versity. 

4. In view of the deep feelings 
aroused in both the academic 
community and the California 
public, the Division reaffirms 
its complete committment to car-
ry out its educational duties in 
the highes t tradition of free and 
responsible education. It ur-
gently asks the Regents, in the 
fulfillment of their own re sponsi-
bilities, to protect the academic 
values of the University against 
political pressures from which-
ever quarters they may come. 

SDS (Students for a Democra-
tic Society) and TNC (Tuesday 
the Ninth Committee) have ob-
jected to the faculty resolution, 

claiming that it is lacking in 
conviction or strength. 

At Berkeley, 150 out of the 
total faculty population of appro x-
imately 1500 have demanded that 
Cleaver be allowed to deliver 
the 10 lectures originally sche-
duled. Cleaver, meanwhile, has 
stated that he will cooperate 
with CEP (Committee on Edu-
cational Policy) and deliver lec-
tures until he is arrested. 

The effect of the Regents' rul-
ing is definitely being felt at 
UCSD. It is not preventing guest 
lecturers from appearing as 
much as it is creating a lot of 
extra paper work for UCSD ad-
ministrators. Every guest lec-
turer must now be screened by 
the Budget committee of the Fa-
culty, and ultimately approved 
by the Chancellor. 

The aforementioned committee 
must consider, in each ca e, the 
applicant's credentials before 
granting him academic status. 
Three letters of recommendation 
from faculty members ar also 
required. Provost Saltman of 
Revelle said that this is creating 
a problem, in particular, in th 
Earth Sciences course to be pr -
sented later this year. 

get ••. " 
Shepard went on to call for 

greatly increased student par-
tiCipation in the university and 
community. "The original class 
at UCSD established a tradition, 
and that tradition can best be 
described as apathy. In an age 
of Columbias, Chicagos, and 
Cleavers, students can't sit by 
and let someb0dy else make up 
their minds for them." 

Referring specifically to UCSD, 
Shepard said, "At most univer-
sities students rely on demon-
strations, riots, and takeovers 
to exert power. With the pro-
gressive policies of this uni-
versity there is no reason why 
that has to be necessary, if we 
take a role like we haven't for 
the last four years. " 

At the Revelle convocation, 
Provost Saltman coined a new 
motto for Revelle College, "cut 
the crap," a paraphrasing of the 
Latin quote from Virgil: "des-
pues quod non est," literally 
translated as "spit out that which 
is not." He even unturled a ban-
ner which a couple of artist 
friends of his had designed. 

Following Shepard, "he provost 
endorsed the A.S. preSident's 
state ment with several rf'ser-
vations. He spoke of the bumper 
sticker morality th t has d vel-
oped today, and the talk of free-
dom amongst those who "don't 
even know th nature ot the 1st 
amendment." But, Saltman said, 
"I worry about th cries for 
student power without a cry for 
student responsibility and con-
cern." 

Finally, it is qistinguished by 
its "special sense of commun-
ity", in which there are no special 
elements of power that belong to 
various segments ofthe academic 
community. Murphy stressed this 
idea of cooperation and unity of 
interests among all parts of the 
academic community throughout 
his speech.

The

1 
uni~ersity com.mlJ~ity today faces a crisis graver than any 

faced .lY higher educahon In this country before. Today the prevalent 
political climate threatens to destroy the concept of a'cademic free-
dom, endanger the quality of education, and generally prevent the 
un! arsity from even functioning. 

In any time of great social crisis and change, the people must look 
towards certain institutions for leadership. Certainly the university, 
s.upposedly the haven of the greatest scholars and experts in various 
flPlds, must be such an institution. 

In r~cent years the university has begun to move in this direction. 
In(!reasmg pressure from students and faculty members who wish 
to see education assume some meaning and relevancy to the world 
around them has slowly forced changes in curriculum. Also, extra-

?urflCul~r groups have moved away from fraternit y-like activities 
mto soclal 1Ovolvement projects. 

As was to be expected, these actions of members of the university 
comm~nity .have created mu~h controversy. There are many who view 
th~ UnlVerslty as an educ4tLOn machine, whose sole function is to turn 
out " well-respecred citizens" - loyal supporters of the status QUo. 
The, fear any attempt to introduce change and reform, or perhaps 

are well satisfied with the way things are going now. 
Peor.!e with this mentality pose the great threat to the university 

and SOCiety. To them, anything not "100 per cent pro-American" 
(pro status quo) is communist. They even profess a hatred for the 
youth of the country, who today are questioning the values of the older 
generation and pointing out their hypocrisies. 

It is in this context that the university moves toward fulfilling 
its proper role of social critic and innovator. The circumstances 
ma. \;: ·' t 'le posit ion of the unive r sity very precariOUS, and there is no 
clear-cut answer as to what is the proper course to follow. 

The university must res ist political pressure from the community 
if it is to maintain the sacred concept of academic freedom. failure 
to do so would risk the wide- scale defection of faculty members and 
the e'lsuing decline in academic standards, as well as dramatiC stu-
de nt protest, would threaten the very functioning of the university. 

However, the university mus t keep in mind the harsh political 
realities of the current si tuation. Several more controversies such 
as the Cleaver matter might bring a legis lative inves tigation of the UC 
sY.5tem. This would virtually mean the end of academic freedom as 
we know it. 

The task that lie s before those in a poSition of authority in the univ-
er sity hierarchy can be compared to that ot walking a tightrope across 
t:1 ;! Grand Canyon. These men must follow their consciences and pur-

su~. t:-te course that is best for higher education and society, while 
t:utng IntO account the unfortunate po litical realities they must answer 
to. The university must r emain free to continue the pursuit of truth

An open letter to the students 01 
UCSD and SDSC 

Allow me to Introduce myself, 
D. G. Hadashi. 

I came to your country about a 
year ago, went to your J.C. and 
am now finally going to san Diego 
state. I have worked at the Uni-
versity of California library. I 
listened to both of you speak, now 
is the time for me to speak . 

There are two beautiful schools 
of thought in this city and in the 
local colleges. One Is love, the 
other !s hate. One is Black Pow-
er and the other is Flower Pow-
er. I love Americans black, white 
and Indians alike. But one thing 
I don't understand. Why don't 
you two schools of thought get 
together and stop your stupid 
bickering. There is a job to be 
done, and if you 're a student then 
why don't you "become" stu-
dents. 

There is a time for learning 
and there is a time for teaching. 
The T.N.C. has a beautiful slogan. 
It goes like this, "If you know it, 
teach it; if you don 't, learn it. 

I have been a spectator now 
I want to be a participator. I 
have only one more year in your 
country so maybe I can give a 
little of the Orient to you as you 
have given yourselves to me. 
The things that will be w rilte n 
in this column wiJI be printed 
simultaneously in the Daily Aztec 
and the Triton Times . 

If you want to get involved in 
each other's thoughts you can 
address it to me through your 
newspaper editor. If I don't know 
the answer I will find someone 
who does. So what do you say? 
Let's get together and come up 
with some good ideas . 

Personally I want to write 
nice things about both of the col-
leges and the individuals who 
make up campus life. But we still 
have to follow our conscience.

Do It Again 

The controversy over Eldridge Cleaver is essentially an outgrowth 
of the reactionary, racist atmosphere that exists today. It is just 
another manifestation of the Nbacklash- against the universit)'--
a desire to "keep them in their place" and stifle academic freedom. 
It is nauseating to hear the grand euphemisms in which the politicians 
attempt to camouflage their objections to having Cleaver lecture on 
a UC campus. 

Superfi?ially, their objections are that Cleaver Is not qualified to 
teach SoclOlogy 139 and that he is a criminal and racist-bigot. Certain-
ly, there is some truth to this, and there are those among the Regents 
and faculty whose objections to Cleaver teaching are based upon the 
des ire to maintain high academic standards. 

But how can one take such criticism seriously from men of Ronald 
Reagan and Max Rafferty's caHber? Didn't Reagan actively solicit the 
Wallace- raci~t vote during the Republican convention? Isn' t it Reagan 
who has d~astl.cal1Y cut money from education and special opportunity 
programs 10 thIS state? If he wants to cal! Cleaver a criminal and racist 
then it must be said that it takes one to know one. ' 

At the recent Regents meeting, Reagan clearly stated that he was 
merely expressing the wishes of the people of California in censuring 
Clea ver. They wouldn't stand for this, he said. Did he care one iota 
about the graver issues raised in the minds of some ot the more consci-
entious Regents--tor instance, the danger of destroying the confidence 
of the facutly, who have hitherto been allowed to manage their own 
affairs? The answer is unequivocally NO! 

Reag~n ~imply didn' t want any part of Clea ver, for Cleaver is a living 
contradlchon to everything Reagan and those like him stand for. 
Cleaver wouldn't lecture about the American dream or the Great 
Society; he would tell it like it is. This is just what Reagan Is afraid 
of having Nimpressionable" college students hear. 

Clea ver is not without his faults. he is not qualified to completely 
lead any course on the university level, and he is not the most un-
biased authority on racism. However, he certainly s hould be allowed 
to express his views, especially if the students and faculty invite him 
to do so. 

Those who designed the course as theydid were perhaps not too wise; 
they certainly have created a public relationsdisaterfor the university. 
However, Cleaver is certainly well qualified to speak on racism, as is 
nearly any black man who has spent most of his life on the streets of the 
ghetto. 

But this is not the major issue. If you want to find the real answer 
look at the lates~ Gallup poll, which shows George Wallace with 21 % 
of the Pre~idenhal vote nationally. Listen to some of the other "back-

~ash' . candidates for election this year. Listen to the subtle violence 
lfl their speeches . Listen to their hatred for all dissident elements--
you won't have to look too far or listen too hard • . 

" WELL. · · so MUCH FOR 
CRIME IN THE STREETS •••• II 

As a result of the decisions reached by 
the Legislature of the State of California 
and the Regents of the University of Calif-
ornia during the week of September 15-20, 
the Senate of ASUC5D hereby censures the 
aforementioned parties as ignorant of the 
principles of academiC freedom and in-
competent in the handling of academic 
affairs and expresses its solidarity with 
the demands of the Senate of the Associated 

Studenh~ University of C alifornia, Ber~ 
keleyo ' 
Furthermore the Senate of the ASUCSD is 
in agreement with Governor Reagan on the 
matter of an investigation of the Univer-
sity. However, we believe that such an 
investigation should be directed towards 
the interests, motivations, and activities 
of the Regents. With this in mind we ask: 

Should politically motivated persons such 
as the Governor and the Speaker of the 
Assembly be members of the Board; 

Should men with an academiC background 
no greater than average have so much 
control over the University (A similar 
a Jument was used against Eldridge · 
Cleaver); 

Should the public University be main-
tained as a teclmical school for private 
industry; 

Should the representatives of that in-
dustry have the overwhelming policy making 
power they have; 

Finally ) can academic freedom exist if 
the University is anything but autonomous I 

And if academic freedom does not exist 
under the present ordering of power can a 
freed University be created? 
We feel that an investigation of this nature 
will be of the greatest benefit to the 
University and the State of California as,o 
a wholp. September 27, 1960

Through a Glass 
Slide Rule Darkly By Just Plain Bill 

This issue marks the beginning 
ot the second year of publication 
tor the Triton Times. It is the 
one and only OFFICIAL school 
newspaper. As such it is sup-
posea to reuect me atutuaes and 
thoughts of the students in the 
school. The Triton Times did 
this last year. The attitude was 
apathy on aU levels. The students 
of this school were (and still 
are, for the most part) little 
more than computerized mechan-
Ical vegetable s. The paper was 
written to suit them. It was more 
or less a UCSD extension of the 
Copley New service (and/or San 
Diego Union). The most contro-
versial thing discussed was the 
decision to 10mate a new food 
plan, the fruits of which you are 
now reaping. 

thought, and then whir-click off 
to class. Or they may litter the 
lawns and let their hair grow (on 
their heads, on their faces and 
out their noses), wear grubby 
clothes, and s moke dope ( so 
groovy) so they can really im-
press Mom and Dad at Thanks-
giving. And if you're a girl, well 
it only takes about two days to 
realize that you really have it 
made. Just pop the pill real regu-
lar like, be seen with the right 
group (the one you picked out the 
first week you got here), and to 
hell with the world or anything 
else. Love? Who needs it? Just 
s mile those phony little smiles 
that only show up all the empti-
ness you're trying so hard to 
hide. 

Well people, you'd better wake 

of the old way. Jus t a s a dyin" 
person often makes one final 
rally before death (excluding 
General Eisenhower) so the 
fascist element in this country is 
making its final rally. U is drum-
ming up all itsremainingstrengih 
and reserves in one last great 
atte mpt to gain control of this 
country. And just a s a dying per-
son often seems to galO for a 
while, doom is s till inevitable. 
The ghettos and the poor through-
out this countr y will be silent no 
longer, the youth wiIl not blindly 
march to the tune of Yankee 
Doodle to die for absolutely noth-
ing. But, unless we use our 
minds and our hands now, we may 
yet see a realization of 1984. 
As an example look at the bla-
tant attempts to curtail freedom 
of the press in Chicago. Look at 
the gestapo which r uns this coun-
tr y unde r t he prete nse of pre-
se rving law and order. "Ah, the 
Justice of it !ago." Our Congress 
has been r educed to a debating 
society. We are fighting a war 
which is "to preserve" peace. 
The pres idential campaigns are 
nothing short of ludicrous. On the 
one hand is Humphrey who never 
says the same thing twice, and 
on the other hand is Richard 
Nixon who never says anything. 
And the most frightening visita-
tion of all is Geor ge Corley

with K and that stands for Klan. 
So open your eyes a.nd your 
minds . Forget about sex for 15 
minutes and see if you're human 
enough to do anything because 

However, things have changed. 
A new staft and another summer 
of hatred and disillusionment 
have given birth to what we feel 
is a revised Triton Times. The 
time has come for us to pull 
our heads out of the smoke and 
do something. 

Firstly, concerning the Uni-
versity. Up to now ithas managed 
to retain the semblance of being 
one. If Ronald Reagan, Max Raf-
ferty, and other neanderthals of 
the right wing continue to suc-
cessfully intimidate the regents 

/ and other officials even that sem-
blance will soon be gone . Their 
latest successful maneuver in 
"The Rape of UC" concerned the 
Eldridge Cleaver issue. It is our 
belief that a university, to be 
viable, must have complete free-
dom to discuss and investigate 
aU sides of any question on any 
subject in any particular field of 
endeavor in any way it wishes. 
The university is the students 
and professors firstly and the ad-
ministration secondly. These two 
groups are the ones who should 
decide how the university will 
act, not the governor or any of 
his flunkies, whom we seriously 
doubt know the meaning of the 
word university. 

The mindless attacks on Pro-
fessor Marcuse are a more per-
sonal example of what the uni-
versity is confronted with. Cer-
tain fascist elements in the city 
of San Diego (that big mass of 
plastic people and plastic houses, 
which boasts its own personal 
ghetto) first attempted to have 
Professor Marcuse fired and 
when that failed, offered (0 buy 
up the rest of his contract with 
the university. Fortunately this 
idiotic proposal was al so turned 
down. There have also been 
threats against his life. Why? 
Because he says what he thinks. 
And what he thinks does not hap-
pen to coincide with the "dream" 
(i.e. apple pie, multiple preg-
nancies, and the dollar). These 
are just two examples which show 
the danger the University is in 
from groups and individuals out-
side. If we do nothing, this school 
is doomed to become a replica 
of that other so-called institute 
of higher learning in San Diego, 
a plastic factory that turns out 
mental and emotional robots who 
care only about easy jobs, hot 
secretaries, and a fat salary. 

There is a second danger facing 
the school which may be worse 
than that of the first. It is from 
within. We come here stealing 
all we can from the University 
and our "friends" and yet give 
nothing of ourselves to anybody or 
anything. The few people that are 
really G.l1ve stand at table s in 
the plaza beating on a waH of 
apathy which cannot be broken 
down by conversation, dialogue or 
speechmaking. Those on the other 
side of the wall, the Silent Ma-
Jority, gape and gasp and mutter 
incantations like hippy, radical, 
communist, leftist, etc. in the 
hopes of warding of! a real 

up. The world is outside and it ' s 
breaking down the walls that sur-
round this monastery and if you 
don 't move you're going to get 
hit with the bricks. Every student 
on this campus should be an ac-
tivist. Get out and do something. 
Join the T.N.C. or the S.O.S. If 
you don't want to because you 
think they're wrong, then open 
your mouths and tell them so. 
Take a weekend of! to visit the

Take a real look at T.J., the 
gateway to our" good ne ighbor" 
Mexico. Talk to the people in 
your dorms , argue, put your be-
liefs on the line and defend them. 
Because if you don 't, in a few 
years you won't be able to. 

And this brings us to the third 
and most important danger tothe 
University, the danger from our 
so-called GREAT SOCIETY (to 
be read while visualizing fire-
workS, flags, and John Philip

of the death ' re needed.

of the Universe tuclen,s 
Conlront La Jollans Bonpane Criticizes US 

Last Tuesday, at the Luther-
an church on La Jolla Shores 
Drive, a dialogue took place in 
which two stockbroker'S from La 
Jolla and two students from UC 
SO shared their views on current 
issues. 

Mike Dillon and Ed DeCar 
represented the La Jolla com-
munity, while Tom Shepard and 
Tom Baer were the spokesmen 
for the students of UCSD. 

There was no main theme se-
lected for the discussion; its pur-
pose was merely to bring about 
a basis for inter-action between 
the community and the univer-
sity. The hostility with which the 
students fee !they are being treat-
ed in La Jolla, and the resent-
ment the people of La Jolla teel 
towards the actions of the stUd-
ents. have often been the re-
sults or misunderstandings, due 
to a lack of communication be-
tween these two groups. This 
discussion was intended as the'in-
itial step in breaking down this 
communications barrier. 

The major conflict that devel-
oped arose from the Question of 
whether economic value s orbas-
ic moral values shoud govern the 
decisions of society. Mr. DeCar 
s tated that he supported the Mes_ 
tablishment- because he believed 
in a continuation of the economic 
growth of the country. 

However, Mr. DeCar was very 
careful to quality his state me nt 
by making the stipulation that 
this economic growth must be 
correctly guided by moral values. 
Tom Baer, on the other hand 
felt that moral standards should 
transcend all economic stand-
ards, unquestioningly. 

Tom Shepard brought up the is-
sue that because stude nts are ar-
ticulate in their repugnance of 
t~e economic basis of this so-
clety, they are persecuted by the 
poli~e force---the most palpable 

ma~ifestation ot the morals of a 
SOCIety. 

The discussion ended witha re-
quest to hear what both students 
felt must be done to renovate the 
existing society. On this point 
the views of the two students 
diverged. Shepard thought the 

c~nge could be made with,ln the 
eXIsting structure, by increasing 
the education of both adults and 
youths, and by revamping the pre-
sent party system. 

Baer was of the very firm 
opinion that the existing structure 
would have to be torn down to its 
basic, good foundations, and that 
a rebuilding of the structure 
would have to start from this. 
Both agreed that the dangers of 
unmitigated capitalism will have 
to be checked.

Last Wednesday, September 25 
Father Blase Bonpane spoke t~ 
students in UCSD's gym concern-
ing United states foreign pollcy 
.in Latin America. In mid-Dec-
ember, 1962, Father Bonpane was 
accused ot "plotting an armed j 
revolution" in GJatemala and was 
forced to leave the country. 

Thus his experiences in and 
knowledge of Latin America are 
very up-tO-date. 

Father Bonpane claimed that 
the United states uses in Latin 
American countries the same 
foreign policy as she does all 
around the world - the policy 
of containment. 

He stated that the Alliance for 
Progress which was set up for 
Latin America had its real goals 
stifled after the death of the late 
President John F. Kennedy. Bon-
pane stated that leaders in the 
United States today flave no real 
conception of the problems in 
Latin America. He said that one 
Latin America. He said that 
one must look at Latin America 
through the eyes of Latin Amer-
ican intellectuals, not through the 
eyes of white Anglo-Saxon lead-

"Only one group in Latin Amer-
ica knows what's good for Latin 
America - Latin Americans " 
Bonpane said. ' 

Bonpane noted two key points 
as to the failure of the Alliance 
for Progress. First, 85 % ot 
the funds that Latin America 
receives are tied directly to U.S. 
products. 

Secondly, he said the aid that 
Latin America rece'ives is act-
ually a loan. He thus fee Is that 
we care little for the welfare of 
Latin America, but rather care 
only for the minerals and natural

On Monday, October 7, the 

student body of both Revelle and 
Muir colleges will have the op-
portunity to hear for the first 
time a regular campus radio 
station at 550 on the dial. 

station rna nager Dave Garen 
has set October 7 as the antic-
ipated openning date for the new 
campus staUin, which is not to 
be confused with the M ham-
radio. 

Program director steve Ciark 
says that the station will pre-
sent a wide range of music plus

some items Qr events of inter-
est to the students. Although the 
station uses the wiring of the 
dorms as antennae, any radio 
whether plugged into the dorms' 
electrical system or not will 
be able to pick up the ;ignal. 

The broadcastlng is tentative-
ly scheduled for twelve hours 
per day on the weekdays, the 
station w1ll begin broadcastinJt 
at 2pm and will run till two in 
the morning. On the weekends 
the station will be heard most 
of the day. All types at music 
claSSical, folk, jazz, both live 
and recorded will be aired. 

The music will be patterned · 
after stations such as KPRI in ' 
San Diego, KPPC in Los An-
geles. or KPSN in San Fran-
?isco; in addition, the special 
mterests coverage will be mod-
elled on KPFK in Los Angeles. 

The organizers of this club 
want as many people as pos-
sible to help and participate in 
this student service and sta-

tion manager Giren' believes 
that the station can only give 
to the students what the stu-
dents are willing to give to 
it. In other words, the sta-
tion cou ld use not only disc 
jockeys but also people for bus-
iness relations, engineering and 
reporting. ' 

No special knowledge of elec-
tronics Is necessary for oper-
ating most of the equipment 
but tor those who are interest~ 

~d, the station aids individuals 
~ obtaining third class, or 
higher. licenses in radio broad-
casting. The main personnel 
ot the new station include Garen 
as station manager, Clark as 
program director, and tempor-
arily, Don Bright as music ad-
viser. 

The radio station is the result 
of two years of hard work started 
by Bright and Jon Collins. The 
effort culminated in a basic grant 
from campus funds approved by 
the Regents of the University 01 
California tor $10,000 plus a 
quarterly stipend of$600.00. The 
club is one ot the very few on 
campus that is not running in 
the red; in fact, the club was 
actually able to give back to 
the A.S. $600.00 last year. The 
broadcasting Is done In a fairly 
common fashion for campus sta-
tions: a transmitter on each of 
the campuses adds the carrier 
wave to the amplified audio sig-
nal and pulses it throuch tbe 
general circuits of the dorms.

IA.S. Senate 
by Dn Waltz 

Notes 
As growth of the student population at UCSD continues, the Assoc-

iated Students' elected representatives will be insurinc that the in-
creased numbers are not mute. Chosen to speak on our behalf, they 
have every Intention of doing just that. The first Senate meeting of 
the new academic year came even before classes began. Present 
were President Tom Shepard, Vice President Trish Cunningham, 
Muir Senators Jon Collins, Steve Greenberg and Steve Ishmael, Re-
velle Senators Jeff Benjamin, BJll Eastman and Paul Ricks, Upper 
Division Senator Tom Baer and Lower Division Senator Tom Peifer. 

- -

Tom Shepard reported the Program Hoard's organization of lec-
ture series on American Foreign Policy (Fall) and the Urban Crisis 
(Winter). The following committee recommendations were unanim-
ously approved: Don Bright, steve Montgomery, Dave Wing and Larry 
Fagot (communications Board); Jon Collins, Don Bright (student Dir-
ectory); Herv Sweetwood and Steve Ishmael (Registration Fee); Nancy 
stobla, Dave Sacherman and Paul Hamburg (Arts and Lectures); 
Cliff Cooke, steve Ishmael, Jeff Benjamin and Tom Shepard (Stu-
dent-Faculty Liason); Jerry Hall and Paul Fogel (Coffee Hut); Paul 
Ricks, Trish Curmingham and Jon Collins (Food Services); Ralph 
Chandler and Jennie Schaub (Auxiliary Enterprises); Tom Shepard 
(Campus Planning Commission); Jon Collins (Diving Control); Suze 
Dascomb (Public Ceremonies); and Israel Chavez (Chief Justice), 

. Norman Black, Cliff Cooke, Reed Ohrbom, Andrea Lindberg, Mar-
garet Kassner aoo Tim McSweeney (A.S. Judicial Council). 

Budget estimations wen) provided by A.S. financial advisor Miss 
Wood with the prediction that A.S. would be comfortably in the black 
by the time the 69-70 officers are installed. The budget has to ab-
sorb an $1100 loss that arose primarily from operating expenses of 
the Indicator newspaper and the UCSD yearbook. The latter cannot 
be published again without pre-sales and advertising. A stage has 
been purchased which will be available to both on and off campus groups 
for a -rental fee. 

Concerning the A.S. Fee Referendum brought up at the close of 
the Spring Quarter which challenged the collection of mandatory A.S. 
tees, President Shepard reported that the refereooum was of quest-
ionable legality based on a student vote in 1964-65. A.S. will approach 
the Judicial Councll on the constitutionality of that petition. Should 
the Council concur with his report, the Senate may hold a prefer-
ential election. Presumably, if fees were opposed, no A.S. fees would

More Growing Pains for UCSD 

Both campuses at UCSD are 
now experiencing the inconven-
ience of over-crowded housing 
due to the growth of the number 
of students who have decided to 
live in the dorms this year. 

Muir campus was expected to 
have housing problems as a new 
class, and consequently more 
students, enrolled for the new 
school year. Revelle College was 
taken by surprise. 

Based on past experience, Re-
velle housing was expected to 
have vacanCies, as it did last 
year. No one was alarmed, there-
fore, when increasing numbers of 
freshmen tiled their first housing. 
installments during July. What 
surprised most people was the 
fact that more returning students 
than ever before signed contracts 
In August to return to the dormi-
tories. 

Consequently, at Revelle there 
are 63 rooms in the men's dorms 
and 10 rooms in the women's 
dorms where people are living 
three to a room. At least 40 
rooms are tripled up at Mulr. 
Further results are people doub-
ling on mailboxes and more 
people eating in the cateterlas. 

The Housing Office and the 
Resident Dean attempted to avoid 
this situation in a number of 
ways. They first looked for off-
campus housing that could be 
transformed into dormitories. 
They also asked San Diego state, 
Cal Western, and Miramar Air 
Station for additional housing fa-
cilities. 

Nothing was available. Two 
alternatives remained: to inform 
new students that on-campus 
housing was filled or to triple 

Students were notified in mid-
August about the situation. 

At the present time, there Is 
little that can be done to remedy 
the problem. Rooms are being 
refurnished with additional desks 
and shelve space. Students tripled 
up will pay approximate ly thrity 
dollars less per quarter. Some 
students will be transterring at 
the end of the quarter' others 
mav move off-ca'mpus. ' 

However, this will probably 
change nothing appreciably. 
Crowded housing facilities will 
remain at least this year. 

Perhaps the best advice is to be 
considerate of others in the 
dorms. It this is done, living 
on-campus this year will be as 
enjoyable as any time in the 
past.
