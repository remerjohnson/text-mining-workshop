The Great Give-Away 
Can they even give them awa)'1 That question will be answered beginning 

thIS week when the AS Calendars are offered free to any student who cares to 
take one of the 5,000 unsold plcwnal timepieces. 

Ongll1ally. back In November, the AS hoped to generate a handsome profit 
from [he sale of the first-ever UCSD Calendars. In all their optimism, 6,000 
calendars were primed: 4,000 of the men of UC D and 2,000 of the women's 
edition. (Someone must have figured that men were more of a salable 
commodity than women.) The total cost of the project was $8.848, according to 
an AS office source. 

Yet for all the ambitious work , at $3.50 a copy, only about 1,000 copies were 
sold between the campus bookswre, the General tore , Assorted Vmyl and TG 
sales. Some AS members vemured theIr opinions on the reason for the calendar 
flop. "It Just looks lousy," said Enc Roede, AS Presidem Craig Lee felt the 
problem was linked to the absence of a good marketll1g campatgn. Other 
council members agreed that the idea of a UCSD Calendar was a g od one but 

away at 

pointed out that the project may have been mismanaged, and that too many 
calendars were printed. . 

In addition , the process of selection came under fi re shortly after the 
calendars fi rst became ava ilable fo r sale. Some members of the AS, including the 
project director, Greg Ricks, were featured as "months" in the calendar. The 
possible inequities in the selection process may have also hindered sales. 

To somehow minimize the monetary loss. wh ich amounts to approXimately 
$5,000, the AS will aUow students to walk away with the remaming stock. 
"Because we can't sell them, we don't want to waste them all ," said 
Commissioner of Public Relations Lisa Wagner. The calendars will be stacked 
up around campus in locations such as EDNA and the student center. 

If the calendars cannot be gIven away, maybe the last seven months can be 
tom off. The p remature obsolescence may be welcomed.

CommentalY-
Common sense for liberals 
By RALPH RAINWATER, JR. 

I am glad Paul Lazerson wrote his anicle for the April 19 GuardlQn. 
It provoked me IntO writi ng a repl}', 10 take the time to write about 
the true nature of conservatism today, especially at UC D, as 
manifested In the Califorma Review. Student conse rvatives are not 
necessarily the pseudo-preppy, egotistical, greedy bunch that 
Lazerson wants them to be. At least he didn't bother prete nding to 
obJectivny, or judicIOusness, or anything one has the right to expect 
from the ednor of a college paper. If his hope was to capture the 
essence of campus conservatism, he failed to even portray the 
surface . Or, altemauvely, if the story was deSigned 10 be a hatchet 
job, then even that could have been done better. 0, the article was 
merely inept, reflecting the snide and snlckenng attitude of one who 
should know better, and IS proud that he does not. 

In fact, Lazerson's article neatly typified and illustrated the reversal 
In quahues usually associated with the terms libera/ and conselvatlve In 
recent years. ThiS reversal IS particularly eVident in our campus 
alternative media Conservatism used 10 denote narrow-minded, 
reactionary types who knew nothing and were not embarrassed b), 
their Ignorance. They beheved things Without questioning them, 
respecting tradmon uncritically. Liberals were the great questioners, 
the compaSSIOnate ones who would change society for the better 
through unceaSing challcnges 10 accepted dogma. And perhaps, on 
the average , that used to be true. 

No more. 
Our student lefusts seem frozen In time They have become an 

increasingly boonsh and bonng lot , whose published thoughts make 
one embarrassed for them They pnnt musty pubhcauons that are In 
dire need of a gale's worth of fresh air. In fact, most of the RCl1cw 
staff joined out of Irrltauon with the low level of thought and high 
level of rhelOnc that passed for student Intellectualism In th e 
altemau\'e media To JOin their pape rs, one must despise the United 
States, wTIle poorl)' and be as slmple-mIndedly devoted to Marxist 
slogans as pOSSible ",Oll e I said slogans, not Marxism Itself I d ubt 
that these staffs have truly read anyth ing except the C1tff ores (If 
those eXist ) to Caplla/, and perhaps the Commum t Man ifc5/O, because 
IS IS short and , above all , elementary These papers parody extreme 
lefust thought. though certaInI) thiS IS not Intended. 

The -conservative" paper the RCl1Clv, IS the unchallenged bnght 
Spot of UC -D student IntellectualIsm I pur co nservauve In quotes for 
a reason: Read an Issue , and you'll fInd that few of the articles 
express orthodox, Re publIcan-type conservaove Ideas Rather, the 
articles are conservauve In the older, Burkean sense The students 
who wnte for that paper call for presel"\,lng what IS In danger of 
being lost among college students - crltlcal thinking and reading, an 
open mind and a wl lhngness to know one's stu ff before wrl[lng on 
anything. 

Yes, thiS is <I student paper, but a thoughtful one despite that 
limitation. It has not attracted paid subscriptions across the COUntry, 
major Interviews from stars on the polItical scene and a readershIp 
second only to the Koala based on Its good looks. 

The majori ty of today's campus conservatives are of the Burkean 
variety. They have taken a look around at the practical results of 
student leftlsm and are repelled . On a college campus, where open 
minds are supposed to be standard equipment, they have seen 
Instead the substitution of clenched ft StS and flushed faces for 
Intellectualism 

And my gosh , how many times have I had the follOWing 
conversation with students who supposedly came here to leam "I

hate the Review and all it stands for ," says the student. "It is racist , 
homophobiC, militaristic and elitist." 

That is the standard litany of epithets hurled at the paper, a litany 
that one never hears split apart. It is as if they seek to vanquish the 
paper through the liberal use of adjectives, 

"Have you ever read an issue?" I will ask, 
"I looked at the headlines once , and that was more than enough ." 
"But did you ever actually read an article from it this past year?" 
The student becomes indignant , righteous - a preacher of 

outdated formulas who lacks only a Bible to render the evangelical 
fervor complete, "I don't read fascist papers! Besides, I'd JUSt get 
angry, so what's the point?" 

No joke is intended here, Leftist students really do protest that 
they aVOId the paper because It might upset them. 01 course it 
would. They would be fored to defend thei r assumptions with 
reasoned arguments. They might be required to reevaluate their faith 
to posltlons that are necessary if one is to belong to the pseudo-
radical f;lmil)!, More than anything eise, such students would have to 
think, and this is not an easy ability to acquire, 

After all, this theology has a list of slogans that justifies theIr 
resentment against the need to compete intellectua lly, their self-doubt 
about their abIlIty to comrete. ietzsche charactenzed soc ialIsm as 
"the logical conclUSion 0 the tyranny of the least and the dumbest , 
I.e., those \"ho are superficial. envious, and three-quarters actOrs ... " 
One might add that our student le/usts are poor actors, tOO. 

ThiS explainS these \\riters' humorlessness. At heart they reahze the 
absurdi ty of an)' phIlosoph)' promiSing Heaven on earth, If Heaven IS 
a huge featherbed . If they fall to be earnestly grave even for an 
Instam, their ablhty to be self-deceivers vanishes. A genuine laugh 
would leave these papers without a staff 

Thu these people thnve on indignation , on egotisti cal self-
sa nflce Continual anger allows them to feel virtUOUS and morally 
supenor. Give them what they deSire and they would fade, WISpS of 
nOlhIngness wllh their foundations swept away 

Which leads us to another reason wh)! campus conservatl m and 
the ReView are on the nse : Conservatives can laugh at themselves. 
How could th e)' be Intellectually honest and still claim to have the 
final word on anything? Look at the ReView's illustrations, or at 
pictures of E.nc Young and others posing In suits. Nobody would ever 
sa)" as the student radicals do, "Disagree with us and you're on the 
wrong Side of history" 

'peaklng of Eri , a word In hiS defense IS alied for after 
Laurson's malicIOUS little caricature. Incidentally, to those who know 
Eric, Laurson's portrait revealed more of himself than of the 
ostensible subject. Read the piece again - isn't it permeated with 
env), and snickenng spite? Eric IS faul ted for dressing nicely, for 
beIng well read , and for his ' Californla good looks" by Lazerson. I 
find it instructive , and characteristic, that such qualities are now 
things to be ashamed of. It shows how far we have come in learning 
to resent those who unabashedly succeed In life, who stand out of 
the crowd In any way based on indiVidual excellence at anything. If 
one has learning, hide it. And wearing anything except faded jeans is 
surely elitist. 

Given such ineffectual attacks on campus conservatism by student 
radicals , james Papp's editorial predicting the ebb of this new 
movement IS premature . Not until the opposing side is willing to 
engage Itself In the "war of Ideas" will other students begin reading 
their views once again . In the meantime, their piles of angry, 
bombastic papers will Sit untouched and unread.

Internationally, Mr. Reagan has 
not only incensed the Soviets 
with his hawkish amlS build up 
and hiS ridiculous East-West 
Evil-Good analogies, but has 
alienated our allies with his

long-term effects. Bur none of the 
above eiims my anger as does 
Mr. Re'lgan 's attack on the 
Constitution. The Constitution IS 
the heart and soul of American 
freedom , anu Mr. Reagan 's 
attempt to change It - by an 
amendment allowing prayer in 
school - is most presumptuous.

Editor. 
DUring the last few weeks our 

country's Administration has been 
moving us further down the penlous 
pathway of nuclear danger. Our chief 
executive has announced that he plans 
to put aSide the SALT II Treaty - one 
of the last vestiges of good that remains 
from past peace effons. This stunning 
blow to relations berween the major 
powers is but another blunder in the 
President's doomsday diplomacy. 

Add to this the startling revelation 
that the United States has been mining 
the waters of Nicaragua. Eighty-four 
United States Senators have declared 
their opposition to this outrage and 
even our allies have expressed disdain 
at this ovenly provocative act. Under 
the present Administration , our 
international image drops while nuclear 
tensions rise. 

Reason tells us we are living in a 
criti cal time as the threat of nuclear war 
escalates with each ticking of the clock. 
That clock must be stopped. 

As informed Americans, educated and 
aware of the danger nuclear war 
presents, we must learn all aspects of 
the problem and be prepared to act 
upon it. The tomorrows have run out. 

The presence of the species of life we 
identify as humankind appeared, until 
the creation of the atom bomb, to be 
here to stay indefinitely, Conve ntional 
war and disease , self-created 
malIgnancies of man himself, were 
destructive only in pan. SocieIY has 
always lived with the reassurance that 
the damage could be repaired 

With the spawning of nuclear wa r, 
however, the panorama of Ii fe on th is 
planet has changed. Within less than an 
hour nuclear weapons can inCinerate 
the world's surface and tum the planet 
over to the hardy insects who, brainless 
but durable , could become the soli tary

survivors, 
The bargaining may no longer be 

done around the conference table by the 
old diplomats who pla n so thai the 
young may uie. We are in the nuclea r 
age , the age of automation . Even a 
computer error could start a world 
co nflagrallon 

The steadying thought is that Since 
we have created nuclear weapons, we 
should and must be the masters who 
will cont rol them. Yet the poitcies of the 
present Administration erode each day 
the unsettled quiet between ourselves, 
the USSR, and the rest of the world . 

It is toward the goal of preventIng the 
evil of nuclear war Ihat a group of 
concerned organizations and alcned 
ci tizens Will present a half-day 
symposium April 28 in the outdoor 
amphitheater of San Diego State 
University. The event takes place 
appropriately during thiS spring when 
the world seems trapped in a winter of 
diplomatic despair. It comes with hope 
at an hour when its message cannot and 
dare not be ignored . 

The title 01 the Symposium is Nuclear 
Issues and the Election '84. The 
presenters include winner of two Nobel 
prizes, Dr. Linus Pauling; Rear Admiral 
Eugene Carroll, the first naval officer to 
serve as Director of military operations 
for US forces in Europe and the Middle 
East; Dr. Margaret Burbidge, President, 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science: University of 
California, San Diego faculry members 
including Professor of Medicine William 
Hollingsworth , Professor of Radiology 
joseph Bookstein (Chairman of the 
Symposium), Communuy and Family 
Medicine faculty member Ruth Heifetz: 
and other distingUished speakers from 
throughout [be United States. 

The Symposium IS sponsored by 
PhYSICians for Social Responsibility and 
the San Diego State Unive rsiry Cultural 
Arts Board. Tickets which are 53 general 
admission and $2 for San Diego tate

CandlelighLp-rotest 

Inhumane treatment of 
UCSD lab animals? 
By PHIL WILtON 

"Bashing antmals on the head with a hammer or 
selling them on fire is not going to benefit mankind ." 
o said one of the 70 protestors during Tuesday night 'S 

demonstration against the supposed inhumane 
treatment of laboratory antmals at UCSD and around 
the world. 

The candlelight Vigil , sponsored by rhe Animal 
Rights Coalition, rallied in from of the Basic Science 
BUilding (where many of the experiments on anrmals 
are conducred) arid mar hed peacefully to the animal 
researc h entrance and the VA Hospital. 

"We're not anti-research at aU," saId Coalition 
President Marie Savino. "We're just pushing for 
al tematlves." 

The prorest focused on researchers refusing to use 
viable alternatives in the place of animals, and also on 
the waste of animal hfe in repeating prevLOus 
experiments. 

Audry Trammell, a coord inator for the Coaliti on, 
gave some graphic examples of "unnecessary and 
Gruel" experimentari on that takes piace in the research 
communiry: forCing of ammals to chai n smoke to see If 
they'll grow back, and locking monkeys in rotating 
drums for sleep studies. 

There were also complaints on the excessive pain 
that some of the animals experience during the testing. 
'1u t because they I the anrmalsl are on a different level 
than we arc doesn't make what is happentng to rhem 
nght ," said prorestor lodd Alexander. "The}' have

UC Lobby unable to work with SBPC 
By JACKIE AFFONSO 
Sacrammro Correspondent 

The UC Student Lobby's effecriveness in 
representing the concems of over 13 1,000 students to 
the State Legislature depends on an incohesl\'c Jnd 
often timcs unsupportive rcl,monshlp With Its 
employers - thc Student Body Presidents' Council. 

Composed of one graduate Jnd undergraduate 
representative (not necessarily the president) from 
each of the nine ca mpuses, the SBPC hires the 
lobbYISts, approves their operating budget, dictates 
which legislative Issues the lobby will support or 
oppose and makes all policy deciSions. Council action 
is decided ~ocrarically at ItS monthly meetings. 

Members agree that while SBPC's working 
rela tionship wirh the lobby is functionally defined and 
the lobby IS effective in Sacramento, there are some 
problems. 

"One problem is SBPC as a group does nO! exercise 
its responsibilities a~ directors well ," SBPC Chairman 
Seot Spicer said . 

Spicer said connlct arises when the council does nO! 
clearly define the lobby's duties and the lobby then 
sets its own priorities, beco ming unaccountable to 
SBPC. Other rimes, polICies are determmed and 
followed through by the lobby hut nothing IS done at 

the rndlvldual campus level to SO"CIt student suppOrt 
or Interest in the lobby's erions, h.: said. Consequently, 
[he lobby is nOt as VISible 10 students, Spicer said . 

Lobby Director Ron Balestrieri , who replaced Miguel 
Ceballos 111 January, saId these conni ts ~re "typical" II' 
the lobby's history. A lortner SBI'C representative lrom 
UC Riverside, Balesmerl said he was aware of the 
different types 01 rel.monships on the council when he 
took over the job. 

"The lobby tends to get «Iught In the tmddle of the 
I counCil 's I political battles between the conservatives 
and the liberals," he saId . 

One thing Balestrieri understands is SBPC's 
responsibility to formula te polIcy. Two or three years 
ago, he said, the lobby was forced to set its own policy 
because no direction was wrn lng from the counc Il. "1 
am not gorng to work on anything that has not been 
SCt by policy," Balestrie ri sa id. 

The lobby is concerned ItS profeSSIOnal effon goes 
unnoticed by a majority 01 the students. Assochlte 
Lobby director JlIn Lofgren said the lobby'S reputa tion 
is unfairly represented by some SBPC members who 
disagree With issues the lobby has been direLled 10 

address by the maJOrity. In Other cases, he said , 
representatives don 't report the lobby's progress 10 
their ~tudent governments 

Members of the Leglslmure, however, are aware of 
th.: student lobby's presence 111 the capiral Jnd have 
both positive and negative reJerions to il. 

Celeste Rose, Special AsSistant to Assembly 'peaker 
Willie Brown (D-San FranCISCo), said , "They rndeed 
are very profeSSional and h,lVe become increasingly so 
over the past few years. They provide a student 
perspeCtIve that otherWise would not be conside red in 
the Legislature." 

One capital source , who wished to remain 
anonymous, Said the lobby IS not as effective as it 
could he because of the way it IS managed. "The SBPC 
IS not represe mauve of students and I think It shows 
in the lobby." 

While the lobby, now and in the past, has been 
successful In cultivating strong relationships with 
Democralle leglslJlOrS, It has not worked wtth many 
Republicans. At ItS legislative awards banquet, the lobby 
awarded 26 Democrats and only 2 Republicans for 
their work on sllldent issues.

I have spent a good portton 01 my

finally realized that I eXist or at least 
seem to extst aparr from mher . tl)'lng 
to understand it. I have used a 1m 01 
energy when it comes down to it. I have 
used almost all the ways 1 know trying 
to understand it. 

I have tried to be friends With it. I've 
been all 100 nice to it. I have tried to 
listen to all it has had to say. I have 
worshiped it. I have scraped knee. 
stripped mysell naked - of clothes. 01

I have tried to be fnends wllh it. I 
have attacked it I have beaten it up. I 
have cut it up. I have chained it up and 
torrured il. I have mal med il. I ha\'e 
tried to sh,lt[er it. I have napalmed it. I 
havc bombed it. I have even tried to 
deconstruct it.

It doesn't really care about what I

problem. for thc only realtty for me IS it. 
It often wants me to hear its problems. 
It always want me to know what it 
experiences of our world. It te lls me just 
enough about what it's doing so i can 
be acquainted with it but nor 
understand it. II sometimes tells me its 
secrets. It often givcs me frustrating 
clues as to its true nature . 

It hides behind a lot 01 fictions. and 
it accused me of making thlllgs up! It IS 
an expert at warping around reality so 
that nobody, sometimes not even it. IS 
sure wh.1I IS really gOlllg on. 1 have one 
theory why it acts this wa)'. I think it is 
hurr . badly hurt. I think thar it IS broken 
In some way that only it can see, in a 
way that it Jnd only it IS always aware 
of. When I told it what I thought was

Women's lacrosse 
comes into focus 
By ROBERT GEYER 

Hey have you heard "bout the 
women's lacrosse team? Well, the truth 
of the matter is that the whole Idea of a 
UCSD women's lacrosse team has been 
a rather hazy one and tS only now 
beginning to take a focus. 

In the beginning (last spring quarter) 
the Idea for a women's club team 
seemed to be just that. An idea III the 
head of one Marijana Danilovtc, a 
student at UCSD. She managed to get 
some other women together who got 
some other women together who. all 
combined, were able to make a team. 
But the team needed a coach , and this 
position was ongmally filled by Randy 
Kauffman He was a pla),er on UCSD's 
men 's team and was wllhng to help. 
Unfortunately. men's lacrosse and 
women's lacrosse are like oil and water 
- you can tir them together as much 
as you want but the), Just don 't mix well. 
The aggressive men's style just dtdn't fll 
III to the fmesse-oriented women's pia)'. 

The call wem out for a new cll<lch 
and It took the form of an ad in Th e 
Reader. Responding to thts ad was Jane 
Fitzgerald. a student from San Diego 
State who had played lacrosse m high 
school and for tWO years a[ the 
University of Virginia where she earned 
all-state honors. According to player 
Karen Bergan. the first thing Jane did 
was to "teach us how to playa women's 
game." Before FiLZgerald had arrived in 
February. UCSD had already played a 
couple of games. most of them turnlllg 
out to be less than positlve. But now 
things have definitely turned around. In 
their latest tournament play up north at 
UC Berkeley, improvement seemed to 
be a dally occurrence. On their first day 
of play they were unce remoniously 
dumped by both ut Berkeley and 
Stanford . but on the seco nd day of play 
they soundly defeated both teams. How 
is it possible to lose to twO teams one 
day and turn around and beat them the 

next. The answer lies m the growlllg 
coordination of the team and its 
recently deSignated goalie, Knss 
Blumuyer. As for team coordlllmion , 
what It seemed to help most was III 
bUilding a strong defense . As 
coach/ player FILZgerald says "We were 
intimidated and uncoordlllated at first. 
but on the second day. the defense 
improved lOO%." She comlllued. 
explaming that the first day of the 
tournament had also been the first game 
for new goalie Blumuyer. At the start 
Blumuyer was really shaky, but as the 
tournament progressed and the team 
could give her a little more suppOrt. 
Blumuyer was able to Improve rapldl)' 
and gam the confidcnce needed for her 
pos ition. 

As for what the team IS dOlllg now. it 
tS getting read y to scek revenge agalllst 
[he Long Beach club team. Long Beach 
was the first team that the newly created 
UC D squad fa ced back 111 November. 
and the Tntons took a poundlllg. ow 
with a new co"cb and a hJndful of 
expenence, rhe)' would like nothing 
bener than to ram a view!)' down Long 
Beach's throat. 

After the Long Beach game the season 
becomes hazy again. What they need IS 
that all elusive emiry called money. They 
need a sponsor who will fund them 
with enough money so that they can 
travel north to the UC Davis 
Championship Lacrosse Tournament. As 
coach FiLZgerald says, ·We are really in 
debt for funding our own team." Up 
until now, the fu nds have come mostly 
out of their own pockets. 

Finally, this is a club team that IS 01T 
to a great start and would like nothing 
better than to become an established 
pan of UCSD spons The team 
encourages any level of player who is 
willtng to make a commitment to a 
developing program that is only now 
getting 01T the ground.

Sturdivant's back 
in the action 
By CHRISTINA KAUS 

Sports InJunes are serious business. A 
back inJul)1 has kept tennis pro Tracy 
Austin out of competltton; an eye injury 
forced the early reurement of Sugar Ray 
Leonard (although he now claims he IS 
able ro fight again); and a recurnng 
back injUry has kept UCSD's number-
one women's tennts player, Cathy 
Sturdivant, out of senous match play for 
the last eight weeks. However, this week 
at the prestigious Ojat Invltauonal 
Tennis Tournament, Sturdivant WIll try . 
to regain her competillve edge. 

"[ feel like I'm not 10 very good shape ," 
says Sturdivant, "But my injUry i n't 
bothering me right now. It seems to 
have healed ." Actually, turdlVant did 
not have JUSt one lOJury - she hurt her 
back three times in three different 
places. The first time she pulled her 
back was during the final game of the 
thtrd set against Cal Poly Pomona. 

"We had split sets , and during the 
ten-minute rest penod, [ didn't PUt my 
jacket on ," said Sturdivant, shaking her 
head. As a result, the muscles 10 her 
back became cold and ugh! before the 
third set began. "It was the weirdest 
thing. [ was serving the last game, when 
[ heard it snap. [t hurt so bad ." 

turdivant kept on plaYing and won , 
pulling off a majOr upset as Cal Poly 
Pomona is a DIVISion 11 school. 

The second ume Sturdivant hun 
herself, she Simply reinjured the same 
back muscle by nm giVing herself 
enough ume to completely heal the first 
lOJUry . "Like a stupid Idiot, [ kept on 
playing on It Ithe tnjury]. 1 kept 

changing my serve around 110 an effort 
ro aVOid aggravaung her ba kJ. and 1 
developed a hacker's serve!" she said 
wah a little laugh. On tratner's orde rs, 
turdlvant finally stOpped playing and 

gave her back a rest. However, in an 
ironic twist, Sturdivant managed to 
Injure herself agatn - but not playing 
tennts. "[ was studying at the library one 
day, and stOod up tOO fast 1 felt a sharp 
palO and knew that something else was 
hun ," said Sturdivant. She managed to 
crack a couple of ribs along with a 
pulled back muscle. This ume, it was 
the nght side that was Injured; the first 
tWO times, the left Side was injured. "1 
guess 1 overcompensated my nght side 
by tryng not to use my left Side," said 
turdlvant. "Also, because [ wasn't 

playing, [ was super-tight." 
For five weeks, Sturdivant was forced 

to be a spectator while her team played . 
"[t was really frustrating. I have never 
been Injured like that before . And then 
to re-injure myself, [ thought [ would go 
crazy." The most frustrating pan, 
according to Sturdivant, was watching 
the team compete. "1 wanted to play so 
badly. I didn't want to go watch the 
team because 1 knew [ would want to 
get out there and play. Then I would've 
hun myself again! " 

In Just twO short weeks, II will be time 
to go to the Nationals. In preparation, 
Sturdivant has been Involved in a fitness 
program which involves datly aerobics 
and runmng. She has also played tn a 
few matches, although in the last match 
she competed in the number-three

At Nationals , in Kalamazoo, Michigan, 

j Sturdivant will occupy her normal 
posaion in the number-one slot. 

Before ationals , however, matches 
against USIU, CSU orthridge and the 
Ojal Tournament must be played. "I'm 
looktng forward to the Ojai ," said 
turdivant. "This will be my third year 

there , and it is a really good experience 
for me. One year, 1 played Alycia 
Moulten ." Moulten is now a tOP world-

ranked tennis professional (Sturdivant 
lost). 

The Triton men's team will also be 
competing at the Ojai Tournament. The 
players from the team are Eugene Jones,

Softball 

The first-ever Campus Recreallon 
Monopoly Tournament didn 't quite 
affect the Dow Jones average but there 
was a lot of wheeling and dealing at the 
Pub before empires started crumbling, 
bankruptCies staned unfolding and the 
real estate magnate came out on top. 

FollOWing the first round of 90-
minute shon.game play, John Houston, 
Dan Walters, John Dahlinger, Sandy 
Purcell, Rob Armstrong and Glen 
Hayashi were asset high at their 
respective tables and qualified for the 
championship round. 

The championship game lasted JUSt 
40 minutes due to Houston's qUick 
snatch of Park Place and Boardwalk and 
subsequent hotel building, making it 
impossible for tenants to comeup with 
the rent. In the shon-game style of 
tOurnament Monopoly, the game is over 
following 90 minutes or the second 
bankruptcy. whichever comes first. 

The top four finishers in the 
tOurnament were Houston with $5,929, 
Purcell with $1 ,225, Hayashi pulling 
$1,1 10 and Armstrong cashing in at 
$1.037. 

Sports Spots 

After splitting with Concordia College 
of Minnesota last week, the women 's 
softball team took a pair of games from 

Loyol~ Marymount as Venessa DaVIS led 
the Triton attack. DaVIS pitched the first 
game in UC D's 5-2 VictOry a nd came 
back to pound out a double and twO 
triples while gomg the distance on the 
mound in UCSO's 5-3 second game 
victory. Kim Allen had three hits on the 
day and Tanya Keedy stole four bases. 

Following the Marymount sweep , the 
Tritons swept LA Bapust 6-3 and 12-0. 
Pam Hardaway'S twO run homer keyed 
UCSO's first game win and everyone gOt 
in the act in the nightcap as the Tntons 
pounded out 15 hits. Davis had three 
hits including a homerun and newly-
arrived freshman Brenda Meskan went 
three for four with 2 RBI's. 

Tuesdav the streak was broken as 
Division II powerhouse Chapman 
College took a pair from the Tritons 4-3 
and 4-1. 

With the week's performance, UCSD's 
founh place ranking in the Western 
region should move up a notch when 
the rankings are released this afternoon. 
The top three reams In the Western 
region earn a spot in the playoffs, and 
with four games to go, UCSO's fate will 
be determined this weekend as they 
travel to Whittier for a doubleheader

from Sbindberg to Bergman to 
Lymberg: 'Julie' on stage at UCSD 

The UCSD Drama Department 
will present the Ingmar 
Bergman interpretation of 
August strlndberg's powerful 
drama, Miss Julie, entitled 
Julie, at the UCSD Theatre on 
May 2, .5, 0\ and 5 at 8 pm nightly. 

The original Miss Julie, 
written in 1888 during 
Strindberg's "Pre-Inferno" 
years, has been recorded in the 
annals as a masterpiece of 
naturalistic drama. In prefacing 
the play, strlndberg took great 
pains to emphasize that he had 
depicted a "case," that he had 
chosen a theme from a true 
story he had heard about a 
certain titled young lady who 
seduced a stableman. 

big, helpless animal who is done 
to death by smoothly 
functioning beasts of prey," 
says Hergman, "She is still 
bound by conventions. Defeated 
by her own kind, destroyed by 
the others." 

Directed by Hartholomeus J. 
Lymberg and featuring Dianna 
Herry as Julie, fric Grischkat as 
Jean and Marla Porter as 
Christine, Hergman's version is 
more openly erotic, coarse and 
brutal than Strlndberg's Miss 
Julie of the nineteenth century. 
While Strindberg saw the story 
as one of social climbing and 
falling, Bergman emphasizes 
the relationships of the men and 
women of the play. Hergman: 

as the Bergman project, he 
produced Ibsen's A Doll House. 
Strindberg's Miss Julie, and his 
own Scenes {rom a Marriage, in 
creative adaptations of works in 
which women come to grips 
with the possibilities of sexual 
and social emancipation. He 
saw the three principal female 
characters (/"lora In A Doll 
House, Julie In Miss Julie, and 
Marianne In Scenes from a 
Mllniage) as spiritually related. 
Bergman's perception is 
governed by a truly existential 
sense of human entrapment and 
isolation, of which bitter sexual 
warfare and woman's quest for 
emancipation are only 
illustrative metaphors. Hell, in 
Hergman's world picture, is not 
a place but a condition 
engendered by the deliberate 
malice that human beings are 
uniquely capable of Inflicting 
upon one anothe~ In no work 
does he more fully explore the 
general condition of existential 
suffering than in Julie, a 
poignant and passionate outcry 
of human frustration. 

Clara Von Lembke and bk: Gri5dlkat st.U' ill tile 19th cenbll), 
dMsic 'JuHe' whkb wUl be performed at tile UCSD Tbeab'e. 

In the play, Julie is the last 
representative of a noble house 
whose bloodline has run thin. 
She is doomed to be destroyed, 
whereas her valet Jean is a 
"species originator" with a fresh 
appetite for life and without any 
cumbersome feelings about 
honor, Julie is an aristocrat with 
high-strung emotions who has 
lost her way among the lower 
classes who do not understand 
her; they trample her ideals, are 
amused by her humiliation, and 
hound her to death. "She is a 

"There's a fantastically brutal. 
cruel eroticism that runs 
beneath the surface of this play. 
There is something incredibly 
primitive and barbaric that 
exists not only In relations 
between the sexes, but in our 
relations with all human beings. 
The important thing for me is 
the tension that arises when 
men and women are brought 
together. OUt of this tension 
something positive can arise-
but also something disastrous." 

Tickets are $2 and are 
available at the Mandell Weiss 
Center. for further information,

60nd In Your Heart," capture 
much of the essence of the new 
power Weller sees in the Human 
Spirit and the possibility of 
change through the recognition 
of this power. 

This record is hard to 
compare because of the use of 
such diverse musical styles. One 
track may be a white soul 
number or a funk/rap, while the 
very next cut on the album may 
be a solemn ballad. A common 
thread uniting all the music on 

Cite Bleu, however, is the 
sincere and driving force that 
Weller and Talbot are obsessed 
with communicating. The spirit 
of cafe Bleu is a "rqolceful" 
one, a celebration of life that we 
all can share. The political 
statements are still bared for all 
to recognize as well, but the 
appeal is through the heart of 
the listener. It is here that the 
record is successful, and is able 
to move the listener. f..ach 
groove is as soulful as the next, 

and you better move to the 
sound or let the sound move

The strength of cate Bleu and 
The Style Council is the 
universal message they carry. 
This is not Pop music or Mod 
music or the music of the guy 
that used to be in The Jam, but 
Soul Music From The Heart. 

"When you gonna find the 
strength of your nature/When 
you gonna let yourself take

Says Meadows. of his hiatus 
from live performance. 'The 
most difficult part of this 
personal growth - doing

singing career in San Diego. "No 
one knew who I was because I 
had just been transferred after 
graduating from Hiram College

third runner-up in the contest. 
they changed the rule to require 
contestants to be a resident of
