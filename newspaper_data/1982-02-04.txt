Would you be willing to fasl for one 
evening to help fight world hunger? 

A recent proposa l. originated by 
Warren College senior Man'in Lc , 
would allow students with meal cards 
to voluntarily skip a dinner CInd 
contribute the money to the fight 
against world hunger. 

"The fast would be voluntary," 
remarked Basem Harb, a Warr n 
representative to the A: , who is 
helping Lee with the project. "The 
main idea IS to raise student 
consciousness on I hl' su bjl'ct of world 
hunger ," 

Lee has been Il1lerl'slecl 111 the 
problem of \\ oriel hunger for st'\l'ra l

Ilarb, 

Problems with the proposal have 
ari"en, hm\ ever. One compltcat ion IS 
caused by the fact that the money for 
t he one skipped meal must tcchn ically 
be given back to the IIldividual 
st udents who volunteer to fast, and 
t he) must then gl\ e credil of the Illeal 
to t he coordinators of the pro)t'ct,

The Bottom Line 

West Point should be abolished 
By MARK SEECOF 

The officer.., \\' lin leaei the I'S mil itan are deri\ ed 
from three malll source~: t he sen ice ac·ademle.." the

men, and the so·called He..,en·e Officers Traininl!

Th s n 'ice academies, Illciuding the l'S ~hlitarv

often career personnel. but m \\ artlnw. \\ hen the 
need for officers becomes great, man) canable 
..,oldiers are offered a chance to attend "O.c. '. " 

The so·called Re..,ene Officer Trainmg Corp~ is 
t he last major source of officers. It con'ii..,h of people 
v.. ho take their military training at and v.. hill' 
attrnding a civilian coil 'ge or university. When the)

and indeed. Lhis i ... why many famous colleges and 
universit ie!-l were founded : to tram militarv officers. 
(That is one of the University of Cilrfornla's 
con"titutional duli s.) Both acadenw and IWTC 
officers possess such an education before they are 
commissioned. but officertraining·program 

waduat es are ofl en larklllg. The military permIts 
"uch officers to pursue their degree part ·time or 
\\ hill' on extended leave, and has program" to assist 
them ,

The monopolizatIon of high ranks by Academy 
men is bad for the Army. Aside from abstract 
considerations of fairness, it is bad b cause the 
system xcludes competent officers while helping

The best curc for the evils associatcd with 
Acadcmy officers is 10 alx)lish West Point. If thiS 
were done, the Academy·graduate clique would 
begi 11 to disaplx'ar, I he charaet er of t he officer corps 
\\'ou ld change as t he constant flow of Aca,'emy· 
indoctrinated lieutenants ceased. and the new 
leadership of the army would be more open and 
beller connected to its socie(\' . 

If West Point H'err abolished, then one of Lhe 
previously not 'd sources of officers would cease to 
exist. Somet hing would ha\'c to take up the load : 

I~OTC. P ople who would have attended West Point 
would attend <lcivrlian college insle<Jd. 

This would be good for everyone. A person's basic 
oplllions are oft en formed or hardened in hi s college 

~ears. Students in civilian coli ges are exposed to a 
vanety of opinions and thoughls. West Pointers arc 
cut off from t h real world- instead of .. ceing "free 
speech" on the Plaza, they o.;ec t he long gray lin e on

It would also I ' more d 'mocrat ic to train the 
IIffirers in ci\'i lian schlXlls. Nowac:ays, many people 
(right Iy) feci estranged from th ir country's 
military, It IS not supposed to be that way in 
Am 'r ica. The s tanding profe~sional army of the la~t 
thirty years, led by "alienated" West Pointers, has

Calli st r is a known elder of 
Ihe Morman Church, whicl' 
spends enormous sums of 
money to stop ERA: hemus! be 
basing his deci sion on the 
position of the church, not 
upon the law of the land . The 
truth is that Judge Callis ter 
did indeed follow the law as he 
perceives it. Yes, if the 
decision is o\'erruled , ERA will 
ha v a chance. But the odds 
are it won't be overruled. ERA

servants. 

It is popular wi th student 
act ivists to dislike ROTC. 
This is beca use it is the 
handies t , most immedi a te 
presence of the hated military 
- the closest you ca n get to 
General Westmoreland, the 
man w h o brought you 
Vi etnam. This ant ipath y is an 
error. If there is going to be a 
military at all (and there is), 
then the officers s hould 
certainl y go to school with 
everyone else. [t i_ theegotism 
or the siege mentality of the 
Academy man that is to be 
feared - not the "contamina-
tion" of university ca mpuses 
wit h officer candidat es. Wh at 
better way to teach future 
officers "good thought s" than 
to have them right next to you? 

One may cont end that non· 
academy office rs are not as 
competent as the academy· 
trained . This is not so. Firs t , 
all new lieutenant s, including 
West Pointers, are sent to the 
same army 'chools l}efore 
being assigned. Second , in 
wartime, when many officers 
must take the field and 
promotion ' are based on merit , 
West Poi nters do no better 
than the other s, and 
competent non ·Pointers gain 
rank rapidly, Besides, if West 
Point were shut down, its 
resources could be diverted to 
e n su ring good militar y 
training in ROTC c1as e . 

A number o f further 
a rgum e nts ca n be made 
aga in s t abo l ishing the 
Academ y. Among them are 
that there wou ld be a lack of 
ca reer military officers; this is 
unlikely. [t is probable that 
just as man y young peop le 
wou ld be interes ted in a 
military career - they 'd jus t 
be att end ing different schools. 

The leadership of the Arm y 
has for years been in the hands 
of men with attitudes born of 
soc ial deprivation a nd a 
s ingular course of indoctrin a-
tion . The effect s of this seem 
obvious. The Army is held in 
low es t 01 ; despite the largest 
spending in hi story, reports of 
mat rial inad equacies and 
unpreparedne ss app ea r 
constant Iy: and soldi ers are 
unhappy with their station s. 
West Point s h ould be 
aboli s h ed, a nd a n ew 
leaders hip should be prepared . 

I
II may be not ed that the 
acad ' my men already in I he 
sf'rvi ce wi ll co nt inu e the 
s tal us quo for years. This is 
unimportant. If a refort11 t ake~

A shift in computer time announced 
Students, administration to benefit from reorganization plan 

By RANDY HILL 
Sluff Writer 

A myriad of co mput e r 
probl em s on the UCSlJ 
campus, including large delays 
in admini strative processi ng 
and t he overcrowded condition 
of terminal s in the EECS labs, 
may be alleviated by a new 
system of a lloca ting computer 
tim e. it was annou nced at last 
week's Academ ic Sen ate 
meeting. 

According to Don Anderson, 
professor of mat hemat ics and 
chairman of the Compu ter 
Policy Commit tee, a number of 
changes wi ll be made in the 
current system of computer 
space all ocation. 

The primary change wi ll be 
a shift of all admin istrative 

co mputing work to til(' 
Burroughs 7800 machine in 
the AP&M building. curren· 
tl v, some adminis trative work 
is' performed on the m:1 chi ne, 
along with a num berof facult y 
and student resea rch projects 
requiring data processi ng. 
Much of the administrati\'e 
computing is run on mac hines 
at Berkeley and l rCLA . 

Chancellor Richard Atkin-
'ion commented that by doing 
all such computi ng here at 
lJCSD, nearly $400,000 \\'ill be 
saved each year. 

A shift in the operations of 
the Burroughs will necessitate 
mo ving a ll fac ult y and 
students currently us ing that 
machine. The plan sti pulates

Expedition reveals new bacterial growth 

Yellow-white-orange bacterial matting extensive off Mexican coa't 
Scientists from a National 

Science Foundat ion -funded 
exp'dition off M 'xico report 
finding extensi\'e yellow-
white · orange bacterial 
mat ting on nx:ks and on t h(> 

. sea floor and an abundance of 
large recl crabs near deep-
ocean hot ~prings. The 
bacteria ha\ e since been 
described by microbiologists 
as the "largest they have ever 
seen" 

The springs abo rontain 
patches of "young" petroleum. 
which have been formed in 
t hous(lnds. r(lt her than 
million.;. of years through I h(' 
pre"sure-(()I)ker-like condi-
t ion" of high temperat ure and 
hIgh pressure at t hese mile· 
deep (6,700 f et) site". 

Scien t i"ts say t he pet roleum 
is not commerciall\' valuable 
at this time but serves (IS a 
natural laboratorv for studies 
of how pet roleu rri forms. The 
conditions at the hot spots act 
much like a petroleum refinery 
in breaking down the 
chemical~ and arc of great 
interest to scientists studying 
the formation of th(' ocean's 
mineral resuurces. 

The expedition this month 
was Ihe first to involve a 
cOlllplement of scientists who 
specialize in a wide range of 
physical and biological 
phenomena associated with 
the hot springs. which have 
()ase~ of exot ic marine life and 
unusual geological s tructures.

UCSD grad student and compose r Carlo Alessandro Landini 

UCSD composer has 
piece played in Paris 

ewly arrived compo. er Carlo Ales andro Landini, who is 
pre ently enrolled as a graduate student in t he Music 
Department , had his "Mu ica da Camera per nove archi" 
(Chamber Mu ic for nine strings) performed at the Centre 
Georges Pompidou in Paris on Monday, Since the work realized 
It s completion. it had been previously performed on Iy one time at 

tudio 105 of Radio France, This work is dedicated tojean,Paul 
Rieunier, who suggested Landini write it. 

"Musica da Camera per no\'e archi" combines two different 
mu"ical approaches which at first glance would seem to be 
contradictory: an extremely avant -garde string technique and a 
more conventional usage of melody, The performance wa ' 
highly apprecia ted by t he Parisian audience and brought an 
e\'ident encouragement to the composer's a ttempt of creating a 
ne\\' trend in western mU~lCal tradition , 

When asked if his participation in the Uc. D Mu sic 
Depart men! is benefiCial to his formation as a composer, Landini 
replied that he is plea'ied ((I take ad\'antage of t he wide array of 
Illusical OPlX)rt unit irs which are a\'ailabl through t he excellent 
faculty instructors and outstanding electronic studio 
equipment.

By H EN RY C H LMAN 
Sacra mento Correspondent 
SAC RAME TO , A two-

year tudy on the root cause, 
of violence C{J .eludes people 
who commit violent acts are 
likely to be under t he in fluence 
of drug , or they were abu ed 
a chi ld ren. 

M inori t ies, t he report adds, 
commit t he largest proport ion 
(If criminal act because they 
are permanentl y delegated to 
the socia l underc lass. 

The report \\'as done by the 
Californ ia Com mi -sion on 
Crime Control and Violence 
Pr eventio n to provide 
ecommendat ions for allevlat · 

,ng t he causes of cri me, 
instead of si mpl y eliminat ing 
the criminal :. 

Th e commiss ion \\'a " 
formed in 1979 sp cifically for 
this stud y, which is sti ll in its 
preliminary ~tage. The 
commiss ioners, 23 political, 
educat io na l a n d med ical 

~tat ew ide representat 1 ves, 
completed the draft last week. 
It was pres en t d to Gov. 
Brown at a press conference 
yesterday. 

"Many crim inal offenders 
(adult and juvenile) eviden ce a 
hi tory of childhood physical 
abuse and neglect by their 
parents," the . tudy concludes. 
"Whi le no simple cause-and· 
effect relationship has been 
proven, numerous clinical 
studi . and at least one large 
scale survey indicate a strong 
association between being 
abused and neglected as a child 

and subsequent criminal and 
vio lent behavior. " 

The report cites a New York 
study of 4.465 families which 
had j u \' e nil e sse n t t 0 
correction c nters. Over 50 
p rcent of the chi ldren had 
parent who werealso taken to 
court as de linquents. 

" High crim e rates among 
so me min ori t y groups, 
particularly Bla ck a nd 
Hispanic, may be due to the 
relegation of a substan tial 
number of their lllember~ to a 
permanent u nderclas~ ," the 
report continues. 

"Members of the underclass 
are denied part 1('lpat ion In 

main~tream American life -
economically and polit ieally. 
This co nditi o n fosters 
alienation, deprivation and 
powerlessness, whieh In turn, 
may lead to a negati\'e form of 
adapt at ion \\-hereby members 
of these group-; react with 
\·iolence." 

The study also reiterate. 
\\'ldely·believed psychological 
theories linking violent crime 
wit h exposu re to \ iolence on 
television and in newpap r:, 
drug and alcohol use, genet ic 
factors and a lienation in 
school. 

Several remedies are 
~ugge · ted , including more job-
