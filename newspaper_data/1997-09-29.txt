Waiting 
to 

UCSD is no fun - especially for 
students from underrepresented minor-
ity groups. 

Nearl) 60 percent of 2,395 under-
graduates who filled out the Quality of 

Campu~ Life Survey last April com-
plained that their social lives at UCSD 
are "not as expected" or "far below 
what was expected." 

Over the summer, members of the 
Associated Students (A.S.), Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) and the 
administration met to try to figure out 
how to make UCSD students happier.

Enacting laws to restrict the actions of 
the paparazzi is unconstitutional 
8, Clint Rockwell 
Contributinl Opinion Writer 

The death of PrincC)S DiOlna has caused 
AI11t."fica to qut.."SIion the validity of the 
paparazzi. Were the paparazzi the CIUse of 
Princess Diana's dealh'! Ciln we allow them 
to continue lerrorizing famous people like 
Princess DianOl·! 

As lI\~h as we would like to lil'd an 
aiternilte cause, ac~·uSiltions like this only 
shift the blOlIllC away from ourselves and 
make the paparu1.i into ~OlpcgoatS. 

Although the public believes the 
paparu7.i should stop. they should not and 
cannot he stop~'<I by IOlWS that ban their 
profession. They can only be stoppod by the 
public that )uppol1s lhem. 

If the paparv.zi are guilty of murder, then 
the public who support the tabloids that buy 
their phoIos an: ICC .. 'SSOrics to the crime. 

Everyone looks II 11b1oid5. They iit on 
the shel,cs of newspaper stands and in die 
aisles of the grocery store. They fascinate us 
with flash)' Iadlines. famous names and 
pictwa .... abMd pmnUcs. 

TIIis is .... de .... f..Jllicl, wich die 

fascination - not with the paparazzi. 
It is easier to blame the paparazzi, and 

the tabloids they work for, than it is to blame 
ourselves. However. the paparaZ1.i .:an only 
work if lhe public continues to support them 
by buying tabloids. 

Those who claim they are not responsi-
ble, lhose who daim they hilve never 
bought one of those trash newspapers 
before. are deceiviAg themselves. 
Everyone is responsible. 

There are very fe,,' p.."'Op1e who ha\'e 
ncver glanced at a tabloid. As much as we 
dislike lhe yellow journllists of our time, we 
still look at their work while in line at the 
checkout stand. 

If we tNly wish to eliminate the 
paparazzi. and end thc:ir merciless allacks on 
public figum in AmcricL we must take the 
t..'Olumnist's in •. :entive aWIY from writing lhe 
anide and the phOloarapher's incentive 
Iway.from tiking the pK.1ure.

Creating new boundaries through 
legislation seems the next logical step 
By NIou MoItaft 
Conlributi/W Opinion Writer 

Since the sudden and tragic deaths of 
Princess Diana and Dodi AI Fayed, the spot-
lighc has been cast on a new villain. The 
media, the paparazzi in particular, arc being 
~Ntinized for the role they have played in 
haunting celebrities with their !lashing cam-
eras. 

Their primary purpose in life is to disgrace 
others with the production of lilth. They bad-
gen:d Princess Diana up until the last mome .. 
of her life, and could have very well been the 
cause of her death. 

With the tunnoil over the loss of Princess 
Diana. new questions regarding privacy in the 
public sphere have arisen. 

Should the paparv.zi be limited in taking 
':Nd.: pi,.-tureS and invading other peopIe'~ 
prhac) '! Do people. C\CII tho~ _-ho iNCn-

buck shot of Princess Di·! 
Imagine the kind of life thrust upon 

celebrities because of the career choice lhey 
have made. They cannot even walk out of 
their homes wilhout being mauled by . the 
paparazzi. 

It would be one thing if the paparazzi only 
took photos at movie premieres or I.:harity func-
lions. where celebrities are there for the sole 
purpose of publicily. Unfortunately, bomdari..-s 
are crossed when they intrude on holidays, 
family galherings and privare affairs. 

The guerrilla-llI.:k style employed by 
those Iess-lhan-admirable phorojoumaJisu is 
the ultimate usurpation of human rights. Thc 
I:onlinuation of the paparazzi's intCfbC and 
prolonged involvement with public figu~ is 
diSlWbing.

~ecming ly plausihk li e between 
Douglas Adams' theory and .:n.:-
ationism. 

Thc first known, orga!1l1eo reli -
gion on this planet is Judaism. One 
of the major tenets of the rcligion, 
as evidenced in the Torah (the lirM 
live books of the Bible), is that the 
Jews are the Chosen Pcop le. They 
were wandering sheep-herders out 
in the desen when one day God 
spokc to Moses and gave him the 
Ten Commandments and the Torah. 

Back in 1994 a paper was puh-
li shed in SllItistiC'lIl Science by 
Doron Willum, Eliyahu Rips and 
Yoav Rosenberg. It indi.:atcu that 
there cx ist~ mathematical proof 
that the Torah wa, cncoded with 
I.!vents oCl'urri ng from the era of its 
Inccpllon to the pre,ent and alm(ht

that encoded wi thin the Torah are 
predictions of the Oklahoma bOll1h-
ing, World War II, Watergate, the 
Holocaust. the Moon Landing and 
even thc comet that co llidcd with 
Jupiter. 

How is this possihle'! The Code 
more or less proves the exi~tencc of 
so me form of a God. Sort of throws 
a kink in the Evolutionary works, 
doesn 't it '! The encoding is so I.:Om-
plex, and so accurate, that it took 
computers to di~over it.

PRIORITIES: 
Free speech outweighs 
individual privacy 
Continued from .... ,. 4 

As we talk ahout what we persun-
ally should do to diminate the loul 
mUl.:kmkers ur our time. we must abo 
discuss what we must not do. We can-
nOl , and must not . usc I.:ensorshlp a~ a 
means to conll\Jlthe paparaJ/i . 

As dlsgusllng as the paparal/.I 
are, we cannot hanish their proll.!~­
sion lrom soclely. Any killd 01 su,-
pension of Ihe Firsl Amendment 
rights of a select group, no mailer 
what they do, is unthinkable. 

The freedoms of speech and 
assembly are specifically enacted in 
the Bill of Rights. Note thatthcre is 
no mention of a "right to privacy." 

The current t:Ourl system has 
formed what is called a "nexus 
right to privacy." The nexus is 
where all the specitic rights merge, 
forming a vcry intangible and 
unclear privilege to privacy. Public 
ligures, such a~ movie stars and 
politicians, have even less protec-
tion under the law. 

Enacting restrktive laws would 
violate a fundamental right. The 
rreedoms of speech and assembly 
cannot be loyed with. How, Ihen, 
can we protel.:t ourselves from thi s 
intrusive group'! 

There is an answer for those 
~talked by the paparaai, those who 
are unwilling to wait for society 'S 
hunger for go sip to subside. 

Today's muckrakers could be 
d~terred by placing a restraining 
order on each photographer and 
every peeping tom that invaded your 
privacy. One by one these lecher~ 
wou ld he dragged into court, where 
they would be held to for thw 
,rimes again~tlhe nexus rlghlto pri -
vacy. 

We must not resort to cen~or­
ship and the restrict ion of rights to 
solve the prohlem of the paparal.li . 
Publlt: figures whose privat:y is 
mvaded must allcmpt to sol ve the 
prohlell1 one photographer at a tlmc

HOPI 10 

MEDICARE: 
Government takes 
away freedoms 
CoIItInued frOlll ..... 6 

The m()~t in~idiou, feature 01 
the whole proces~ i~ that the only 
people who are heing depn ved of 
their freedom are in the middle 
das~. Tho~e who I:an afford to pay 
all their own medical hills without 
the Medicare supplement will be 
ahle tn continue to visit any doctor 
and rel:eive any prol:edurc they 

wi~h, and the brightest doctor~ , 
who value both Ireedom and the 
bottom line. Will .peciali/.e In .erv-
Ing their need,. 

Poople who l:annOI alford 10 pay 
any of their own medical cO\t, will be 
in the >arne position as before. going 
to fn.'C dinks and getting whatever 
Medicare will provide. Those in the 
middle da.~s, however, will no longer 
be able to make their own <h.:isions 
on how to spend what wa.~ originally 
their money before the tax man I:ame 
and took it away. That's big govern-
ment for you though - true friend of 
the little guy. 

Senator Jon Kyl, a R.:puhlll.:an 
from An/una. likened Section 4507 
to a hill thaI prohlhu\ ,elllor I:lti-
l en, from supplem.:nting their 
Social SecurilY Income with private 
funds from retirement account~ and 
pen \Ion •. However, it '!. even wor,c 
than that. It's like telhng Social 
Security recipienl!> who usc their 
money for rent that they can only 
use it to pay for a certain si7..e house 
in certain location., or else they 
cannot spend it at all . 

Apparently. if the government 
cannOI lake away all your money 
amJ spend II as they wish. as Ihey 
ba,ically did in old .ociali.t and 
I:ommuni,t I:ountne., they are 
gOing to try to do the next he>! Ihing 
and tell you how you have 10 pend 
it. Why bother wllh all the fuss of 
actually taking your money away if 
they can Mill control if! 

Of course, the quality of the 
everyone's healthcare wi II 
decline over the long haul a. 
fewer qualified and intelligent 
people feel that the return 
allowed them by the government 
on their investment of year. of 
Illne and effort I. no longer 

_The UCSD Guardian 

In spite of the 
drudge,y of the 
task, It would have 
behooved the 
medical community 
to take. bit more 
tim. to go over 
Section 4107, which 
does more to 
advance socialized 
medicine and 
government 
restriction of 
fre.dom of contract 
than anything since 

"Hlllary~r •• " 
worth the expenditure. Price con-
trols never work, and the more 
the government becomes 
involved with something the 
more its quality deteriorates.

THEORIES: 
Could the Earth be 
a giant computer? 
ContInued from ..... 5 

But II you con~ldered that It too(" 
a computer to decode the Torah. it 
could be suggested that a I.:omputer 
wrote it 3.000 years ago - or per-
haps that the Bible is actually a 
computer program. 

If Wilzum, Rips and Rosenberg 
believe the Torah is encoded, deci -
pherable only with the aid of a 
computer. and Adams professes 
that the Earth IS a computer, then 
perhaps the Torah is the computer 
program that runs the Eart hand 
every person. every thing. every 
event that occurs on thi s planet is 
planned. What does that indicate 
about the Universe and our minus-
cule place in it'! 

There is yet another theory 
worth noting. A theory e)(ist~ 
claiming that creationism and evo-
lution arc merciy unproved expla-
nation. for our exislence here . 
There is also a theory that main-
tains the Bible Code is convoluted 
and sketchy and that the creation of 
planets for pleasure and as comput -
er~ i~ it bit silly. 

Thl~ theory supports the notIOn 
that the peoplc hving on this planet 
ar.: mcrely desl.:endanh 01 rej~ch

I rom many different planet~ . On~ 
race wa\ dropped in what I. nn ... 
Africa. another in Asia. another in 
the Middle East. another m 
Northern Europe and a group in 
South America as well. 

This theory calls attention to a 
question that h3s ocl.:upied some 

mind~ for years . How exactly were 
the Jews just raising sheep OUI in 
the desert for 40 years when Ihere 
was no food for the sheep to eat. 
much less the- people, and no 
water'1 This theory provides an 
answer. 

The people were never really 
wandering. but were dropped here 
as rejel.:t, from another planet. Th..: 
wandering story was merely creat-
ed to confuse future generation~ 
into believing evolution or cre-
ationism.

Terry Lew 
Editor in Chief 
Weighty Decisions: 
Choosing a Future 

Some people have known for 
ncarly their entire li vc~ exactl y 
what their .:arcers wou ld be. ( wa~ 
never one of them, hu t I came 
clo~c. Ever ~im;e I started co llege. I 
knew - beyond the ~hadow of a 
doubt - that I would lind myself 
In a major newsroom, on dead line. 
the day after gradual ion . Un til 
abou t 48 hour~ ago, I still did . Now 
I'm not so sure. 

The nex t few paragraphs may 
come as a shock to the three or four 
of you Ihat actually read my 
columns, since ( usually prattle on 
and on about how ( eat, breathe, 
sleep and dream journalism. 

For the last few days, ('ve been 
thinking more and more about 
graduate school. This may surprise 
some of you who know me, 
because you know that I've never 
given grad school a serious thought 
before in my life. 

This might be just a passing 
phase for me, but for now I'm 
going to pursue it and see what 
happens. As one person reminded 
me, I don't want to be asking 
myself, "What if.. .. ?" for the rest of 
my life. 

I'm considering applying for a 
Master of Public Health program, 
focusing on healtll.policy - a field 
to which, while fascinating, I never 
gave much thought. 

Part of what 's driving me 
toward graduate school is the 
incredibly tight job market for jour-
nalists. Well-trained engineers are a 
valuable commodity, but good 
reporters are literally a dime a 
dozen, The trick is to have a spe-
cialty - and I figure that with what 
is essentially a professional degree, 
I should have a pretty good niche 
carved out for myself. 

As I said before, I had never 
given any serious thought to grad 
school unti I a couple of days ago. I 
was at the doctor's offi ce, having a 
routine eye exam, when the oph-
thalmologist and I began talking 
about my plans r or I hc future. 

The doctor tumed out to have 
been a guest ~peaker in one of my 
classes a couple of quarters ago, 
and we talked about my interest in 
hea lth policy and what I ~ould do 
with it. In case anyone cares where 
that inlerest carne from, here's a 
crash course on the San Diego 
heahhcare market: 

Unti I a year or so ago, I 
.wouldn ' t have known managed 
care if it came up and bit me in the 
intensive care unit. In April 1996, I 
was the Guardia,,'s associate news 
editor. ( breezed into my office one 
day, Checked the mailbox, and 
noticed a fl yer for some son of hos-
pital ~taff meeting. 

The UCSD Medical Center'~ 
two ho~pi tal s were in serious finan-
cial trouble at the time, as was just 
about every other hospital in San 
Diego. The bollom line was that 
while revenues were stagnant, costs 
were skyrocketing. 

Being the bright-eyed, bushy-
tailed reporter that ( was, I immedi· 
ately hopped on the first shuttle bus

UCSD Guardian Features 

Pat~ Choi was born on June 
7·, 1976, the only child in her 
family. Raised in Diamond Bar, 
California, she is now a senior at 
Thurgood Marshall College with 
a double major in women's stud-
ies and political science. She is 
minoring in law and society. 
Claim to Fame 

Choi served as a student rep-
resentative to the Chancellor's 
Advisory Commitlee on the 
Status of Women (CACSW). 
The committee released a report 
early in the summer detailing the 
status of a variety of women's 
issues on the UCSD campus in 
lighr of the passage of 
Proposition 209 and the end of 
affirmative action. 

She also served on two 
CACSW sub-committees. 

"I was on a domestic violence 
committee, which addressed the 
fact that there are absolutely no 
resources, information or publi -
cations on violence against 
women provided by UCSD. I 
was OQ a student sub-committee 
along with the former A.S. pres-
ident, Coleen Sabatini , and three 
other women, all students . 

"We're currently writing a 
recommendation to the 
Chancellor with our evaluation 
of the resources available to 
women students on campus, 
including the core-curriculum 
classes like Humanities and 
Dimensions of Culture (D_O.C.) 
and whether they incorporate 
women's studies, student-safety 
issues, student health" sexual 
harassment 'and mentorships 

available on campus."

18 SPOJUGfITS The UCSD Guardian FEATIJRES 

Studies show that, "The myth of equality in higher educatior is just that, a myth," as one researcher says. 

The underrepresentation of women on unil'ersit) faculty reflects a troubling 
isolation from gender issues 011 college campuses nationwide 

..I \t fall. the vote~ ora majority ofCalifornian~ 
cnded an era. Propo~ition 209, thc ~tatc\ 
Jffirmati\'e action program~ ended, leaving 

the ~oci JI. p rofe~~iona l , and educational communitie~ of 
the state on ~upposedly "even playing lield~. " 

From In educational perspective. this was partially 
ju~ti lied - 11l0~t of the undergraduate population at the 

state'~ lInl\e r~itie~ now contain approximately equal 
num ber~ of male and female students and. in some. 
wOlllen even outnumber men. 

Similar t rend~ of gender equality have also started to 
permeate California graduate s hool~ - also with an 
approximate 50-50 split between male and female stu -
dent,. In the universities' doctoral program~ , women 
havc I11JJe great strides - 35 percent and, in some 
department~. a~ much as 50 percent of tho. e who 
received Ph. D.s were women. 

The progression towards gender equalit y in 
Ca li fornia '~ univer~ities stops there. When studenb 
returned to the classrooms these past few days, they 
were greeted, on average, by a white male professor in

hi~ 50~. Though women nm\ reprc~ent one-half of 
alm o~t all university population~. at the nlvcr:-.ity of 
California they constitutc only 22 perccnt of the facult) . 

At UCSD. onl y 16 percent of the "ladder ran"" facul -
ty are women. according to the recentl released report 
from the Chancellor\ Ad\isory Committce on the 

tatus of Women (CAC W). 
"Womcn lat UCSDJ are ~ti II ~igni Ileantly underrcpn.;-

sented among ladder ran " faculty and e~pecia ll y in th~ 
a~socii:lte and full profe~~or ranh whi Ie on the ~tafr side 
women's share of position~ decrea!-.es proportionately a~ 
we ascend the job ladder," rcported the com rnis~ion . 

As the numbers show, the equality ac~ieved within 
the Univer~ity of California's undergraduate, graduatc 
and doctorate program~ has not yet reached the lOp le\ -
cis of the faculty - arguabl) . where the change~ ~hould 
have begun. 

In fact , according to a gcnder inequity ~tudy by 
researcher D. Alpert, if the addi tion of women facult ' 
members continues at it~ current pace, a 50-50 split of 
female and male professors will be achieved only in the 

year _149.

mcmbers before 2005 to cope both with retiring profes-
sors and overall expansion. 

"We will havc a unique 0pp0rlunity over the next ten 
years 10 hire a new generation of young faculty," says 
Martha S. West, a UC Davis professor of law, in her 

~tudy Ce"der BillS ill Academic Rohes. "This is our 
chance to diversify. If we do not substantially increase 
the percentage of women hired over the next few years, 

See WOMEN, Page 20 

The number of tenured faculty members of color is 
incommensurately representative of the general population, studies indicate 

imes have changed - gone are the days in 
which women and people of color were 
grossly underrepresented in academia. The 

Civil Rights Movement and the Second Wave of 
Feminism have helped to clear the path for females and 
ethnic minorities. We live in an enlightened era in which 
everyone, regardless of race, sexual orientation or gen-
der, is on equal footing on a very level playing field -
right? 

Well, not exactly. 
Although affirmative action has helped to increase the 

number of female professors and professors of color, 
demographic realities indicate that academia is far from 
close to commensurate representation. 

Of the 489,000 full-time instructional faculty teach-
ing in American universities in 1987, 89.5 percent were 
white, 3.2 percent were black, 2.3 percent were Latino, 
4.2 percent were Asian and 0.7 percent were Native 
American, according to the National Center for 
Education Statistics. 

Although this total of 10.4 percent minority faculty is 

StORY BY 
COLOR 

a slight increase over Ihe 7.2 percent reported in 1976, 
recent studies report that while the overall numbers of 
women and racial minorities have increased, their pres-
ence as a percentage of college faculty is significantly 
disproportionate with their growing numbers in the pop-
ulation as a whole and with their increased presence at 
the undergraduate level. 

Studies indicate that white men enjoy an advantaged 
career path into and through the university. At UCSD, 
the numbers of women and people of color as tenured 
faculty members are significantly smaller than those of 
their white male counterparts. 

According to a survey published by UCSD Academic 
Affirmative Action office, women comprise 13.9 percent 
of the tenured faculty. People of color comprise 14.5 
percent, with African-Americans representing just 1.8 
percent (neither t~e School of Engineering, the School 
of Medicine nor the Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
have tenured any black faculty members). Latinos repre-
sent 3.8 percent (there are no tenured Latinos at 
Scripps). Asians represent 8.8 percent and Native 

Americans represent just 0.1 percent of tenured faculty 
(UCSD has tenured only one Native American). 

"Representation of Chicanos/Latinos in the U.S. pro-
fessorate remains the absolute lowest of all racial and ;', 
ethnic groups when their proportion of the U.S. popula-
tion is considered," said Fresno State University profes-
sor Hisauro Garza. 

Why the disparagingly low numbers? Researchers 
cite several reasons: racial -minority faculty members 
experience severe marginalization and are thus deterred 
from pursuing tenure; the university's lack of persis-
tence in seeking to recruit people of color; lack of 
knowledge regarding the criteria for tenure and promo-
tion due to the lack of mentorial and collegial support as 
well as feelings of isolation; institntional factors such as 
early educational experiences; and psychological fac-
tors. 

"[Racial-minority faculty members] cite everyday 
interactions, both social and professional, as sources of 
their feeling unwelcome, unappreciated and unwanted,:'

we will lose the only opportunity 
our generation will have to alter the 
CUfrent gender imbalance among 
college and university professors." 

In terms of achieving a more 
favorable gender balance, this 
demand for profe~sors could not 
come at a beller time. More women 
than ever are completing their 
Ph.D.s, evening out a traditionally 
male-dominated applicant pool and 
making the goal of hiring addition-
al female facuby members a more 
feasible reality for all universities. 

"Under principles of equal 
opportunity, at least 40 percent of a 
college or university's current hires 
at the assistant professor rank 
should be women, reflel:ting 
women's availability in the national 
Ph.D. pool," wrote We~t. 

However the discrepancies 
between the number of male and 
female professors hired are only 
the tip of the iceberg. The universi-
ties face many problems in achiev-
ing gender equity throughout their 
faculties.

"What is happening is while 
they are hiring more women, the 
percentage of women who are 
being tenured is still low - 13.9 
percent. This means that the num-
her of women hired in universities 
is at the entry level," said Associate 
Chancellor Susan Kirkpatrick, a 
I:onsultant to CACSW who helped 
compile the report . 

Kirkpatrick was the first women 
professor in the UCSD Depanment 
of Literature to receive tenure in 
1971. 'That was a point at which 
universities were beginning 10 
become aware that they didn' t have 
any women professors." 

One of the few senior faculty at 
UCSD who is female i~ thc new 
Senior Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs, Marsha 
Chandler, who began in August. 
However, Chandler's appointment

cd al Ohio State Universi ty. Some

Pcople of color arc not largely 
aCl:cs~ible to rCl:ruit into fal:ulty, 
and, onl:e hired. arc deterred from

than the rule. 
The rarity of finding a female, 

,enior-Ievel faculty memher isn't 
unique to UCSD - at most uni-
ver,lIics, over 90 percent of profes-
sors with tenure are male. A study 
by the Temple Lmv Review show, 
an alarming discrepancy : on aver-
age, 46.3 percent of a university's 
male professors have received 
tenure, while only 7 percent of it~ 
female professors have done so. 

Instead of progressing up the 
career ladder like their male coun-
terparts, women seem to be ,tuck 
on the bottom rung, a problem with 
far-reaching consequences. 

The exclusion of women from 
desirable faculty positions has a 
more long-term implication -
si nce women arc predominately 
restricted to lowe r level positions, 
they possess virtually no depan-
mental or university-wide "cloul.'· 

According to a study by the 
National Association for Women 
Deans, Administrators and 
Counselors, a majority of women 
"believe that they are excluded 
from the 'networks' on I:ampu,." 

A survey by the Projecl on Ihe 
Status and Edul:atinn of Women 
wmpiled similar res uh~.

The UCSD Medical Center began 
to slowly emerge from the sea of 
red ink that surrounded it. 

Despite the hospitals improving 
financial pictures, merger talks 
wntinued and UCSD's choice soon 
bel:ame clear: join with the ix non-
profit Scripps hospitals, or shack 
up with the six-hospital Sharp 
chain - itself in merger disl:Us-
sions with the for-profit 
ColumbialHCA behemoth. 

The UCSD Guardian 

tie easier on the world's largest for-
profit hospital concern. With more 
than $20 billion in revenues annu-
ally, ColumbiaIHCA is a force to 
be reckoned with by anyone.

well - and since my only exposure 
to college-level science thus far has 
been five minutes of Chem 6A, I'm 
a somewhat-Iess-than-stellar candi-
date for admission. 

Let's not even mention my total 
lack of preparation for the GRE, or 
the fact that my grades - while not 
eX3l:tly patheti l: - aren't quite 
what admissions committees arc 
looking for. I keep asking myself 
why I'm even thinking of graduate

pital wa~ losing $1 million per 
month, and that admini,1rators 
were planning to oust a~ many as 
700 people in a last-ditch effort to 
balance thl.! hooks . 

Sharp agreed in November -1995 
to ,ell four of its six hospitab to 
Columbia, and the chain 's board 
voted to go ahead with the sale 111 
May 1996. The board was forced to

I may not be the 
most competitive 
candidate In the 
world, but I figure 
I've got a fairly 
decent chance of 
getting In • 
Somewhere. I may 
get turned down by 
Harvard, or aerkeley 
or even SDSU, but I 
can stili try - and If 
I get In, great! If I'm 
rejected, so what? 

Today, UCSD's hospitals are 
strong enough that administralors 
anticipate turning a slight profit at 
the end of this fisl:al year. The 
Scripps hospitals are seemingly off 
in thei r own IiUle world , whi Ie 
Sharp slruggl~s with the ramifica-
tions of its failed deal with 
ColumbialHCA. Meanwhile, 
Columbia anll its creative account-
ing rrlletil:es are under ever-

Increa~tng state and federal ~cru ti ­
ny.

I have some fir,t -hand experience i in my dlO~en field . I have the

office later that day and wrote a 

~I:reaming headline warning of 
mas~ layoffs, impending doom, 
plagues of locusts and other a~sort­
ed di~asters. The layofh I:amc to 
pass, just as Popyack warned they 
would, and the hospital ended the 
fiscal year $20 million III the hole . 
For ~ome reason, the locu~t~ nl.!\er 
~howed . 

In Jun l;! of Ihat year, the UC 
Regents sent Chanl:ellor Robert 
Dynes on a quest - not for a 
shrubbery - but for a ~trategic 
partner to leasc and operate 
UCSD's Hillcrest and Thornton 
hospitals. ThaI summer. rumors 
and allegations flew like bad 
toupees in a strong win9. Although 
UCSD spokesperson Leslie Franz 
dismissed the idea as "absurd ," 
rumors persisted Ihat the hospital s 
would soon shut their doors for 
good. 

Layoffs continued, and the hos-
pitals' fiscal hemorrhaging finally 
slowed to a trickle with the help of 
the Hunter Group - a I:adre of 
obscenely-well-paid I:risis-man -

ovemhcr 1996, when California 
Attorney General Dan Lungren 
began to queMion Ihe sale, and 
Sharp finally abandoned Ihe deal in 
February 1997. 

While joining forces with 
Columbia - the HOO-pound gorilla 
of the hcalthl:are industry - would 
havc given Sharp much-needed 
capital , the legal and ethical q\lc:,-
tions raised by abandoning non-
profit status and joining the for-
prolit ColumbialHCA ultimately 
sank the proposal. 
. Meanwhile, UCSD Chancellor 
Robert Dynes and other interesled 
observers were watching the fire-
works and quietly making up their 
minds to go il alone. In September 
1996, after twO hours of closed 
debate, the regents agreed that 
UCSD could stay afloat on its own 
for at least a few more months. 

By January 1997, Dynes had 
essentially ditched the idea of a 
broad lease in favor of tightly-
focused, strategic partnerships - a 
good idea, considering that three 

Six Flags' 

ColumbiafHCA executives would 
soon be indicted on a variety of 
federal fraud charges. 

In the wake of the July indict-
ments. and the resignalion of 
Columbia's top two executives, the 
company 's new CEO promised to 
overhau I the bi II i ng, referral and 
I:ompensation practice, at the heart 
of1he federal investigation . 

Many regarded it as a case of 
too lillie, 100 late, but it may indine 
govemment prosecutors to go a lit-

In a nut~hdl , that 's thc state of 
he.lltheare In San Diego today. I've 
been the Gllardiall"s n:~ident ho~­
pltal-watcher slilce that lirst union 
briefing a year and a half ago. and 
I've become more and more fa~ci ­
nated wi lh health policy as lime 
goes by. 

r rCl:ogniled Illy growing inter-
e" in puhlic health a few quarler~ 
ago, and 1 began signing up for 
classes left and right. My "real" 
introduction to the American 
hcahhcare sys tem came from 
Barbara Brody, as did my under-
standing of some of the health 
issues facing the poor and other 
underscrved populations. 

I learned far more than I cared 
to know about medical anthropolo-
gy (not necessari ly a had thing) 
from Lola Ross, and I'm discover-
ing the intricacies of medical soci-
ology this quarter with Mark Jones. 

Unfortunately, I've disl,;Overed 
that graduate schools want more 
than just a few quaners of relevant 
course work. 

In my case, they want science as 

Guardian anll a variety of other 
c \trac urri clllar~ behind me, and I 
have a wide net work of contact, 
ready, willing and 'abk (I hope!) to

graduate school. Not one told me I 
didn't have a snowball '~ chanl:c in

I may not be the most competi -

RACE: 
People of color 
underrepresented 
Contlnu.d from lNCe 20 

One sludy indicaled Ihal Ihe 
scarcity of racial-minority faculty 
members is the result of a cyclical 
pattern - because there are few 
facuhy of color. role models and 
menlOrs are rarely presenl for stu-
dents of color and Ihus no one 
encourages and guides Ihem loward 
academic career or eyen shows 
them how it is done. 

The study concludes. that a sig-
nificant numher of undergraduates 
of color will never get on a gradu-
ate school "track:' 

The presence of racial-minority 
faculty can have both negative and 
posillve effects, however. On the 
one hand, they can serve as role 
models, with Iheir prescnce attest-
ing that there is indeed a place for 
people of color in academia, 
according to a 1991 study. 

On the other hand, such faculty 
arc more likely to report feelings of 
under-appreciation. discriminalion 
and lack of support in their work, 
which they often feel is devalued 
and viewed as peripheral. 

Students who sec their role 
models being treated in such a 
manner arc likely to think twice 
before pursuing an academic 
carCfr, according to the ludy.

Although numbers seem to indi-

Asian-A mericans are not as under-
represented In the faculty ranks as 
African-Americans, Chicanos and 
Latino and Native Americans, 
CClA Associate Professor and 
Director of LClA's Asian-
American Studies Cenler Don 
Nakanishi said that Asian-
American are not exempt from 
experiencing disc rimination. 

There are three misconceptions 
aboul Asian-American fa~ulty and 
administrators, says Nakanishi , 
whose own three-year slruggle to 
gain tenure challenges the widely-
held belief that Asian-Americans 
- as the "model minority" -
don't face discriminatory practices 
in institutions."" higher educalion. 

The first misconceplion is that 
ASian-Americans are well-repre-
sented in college faculties and key 
administralive positions, Nakanishi 
said. In facl, Asians face declining 
representation in Ihe university. AI 
UCLA in 1987, Asians represented 
20 percent of undergraduate fresh-
men. but only 10 percent of all 
entering graduate students, six per-
cent of non-tenured faculty and 
four per~ent of lenured faculty.

WOMEN: 
Few universities are 
'family friendly' 
Continued from pace 22 
ing but, while male assistants have 
male professors for role models, 
female role models are much hard-
er to find . In her opinion, hiring 
more women will trigger much 
more long-Ierm positive growth 
towards gender equity. 

Achieving a " level playing 
lield" wi II take years, leaving some 
with more immediate and practical 
I.:onsiderations. Even in the "mod-
ern" nineties, some studies indicate 
that women university faculty take 
home only between 77 pen;ent 10 
86 percent of the salary of their 
equally-qualified male counter-
parts. 

'1'here is no disagreement that 
women are paid less than men," 
says Hensel. 

The discrepancy in salaries is 
most pronounced at the full profes-
sorship level. perhaps due to the 
fact thai men may historically 
receive tenure more frequently than 
women. 

"My husband and I started off 
equally with degrees from the 
same sl.:hool." said one female

"It's primarily difficult for the

to wort, have to be in a lab. You jusl 
can't do that when you have a baby," 
she said. Fields such as English and

claims. 

"Where it gets out of kilter is the 
level women are hired at," 
Kirkpatrick says. "That allows for 
some negoliation - whether you 
are hired on at level one or level 
two. Men are often more aggressive 
negotiators Ihan women, so they 
often are hired at the higher paid 
level. You can also get off-scale

Though it seems a clear-cut case

"After broad consu Itation and a 

great deal of retlection it is the con-
sidered opinion of the committee 
and its co-chairs, thaI... an advisory 
committee tracking the status of 
women at UCSD is valuable and 
necessary, now more than ever," the 
CACSW report states. "Any even 
cursory glance at the statistics on 
the representation of women in fal.: -

said Hensel . A recent UniversilY of 
Wisconsin study showed that 
women spend 2.5 times more lime 
on child care than men. 

According to Kirkpatrick , 

The UC system used similar 
ideas in a system-wide policy, 
which stops the tenure clock for 
one year after childbirth. However,

RACE: 
Asians not free from 
discrimination 
Continued from ..... 24 
per(;ent of the tenured facullY. 

Moreover. Nakanishi said, a sig-
niticam number of Asian profes-
sors on college facullies arc foreign 
nationals who received a substan-
tial portion or thei r higher-educa-
tional training in Asian countries 
and thus, the number of Asian -
American faculty members is con-
siderably lower than represented. 

The second mis(;onceptiun is 
that Asians do not face discrimina-
lOry or unfair employ ment prac-

t ice~ at the universi ty level, 
Nakanishi ~aid . 

"[The mlsoonceplionj i ~ an 
extension of the claim that Asians 
have been fully a(;cepted in 
American life and no longer 
encounter either overt or covert 
racial discriminatiun lhal might limit 
their opportunities for social and 

profe~s ional advancement," he said. 
"[ Anotherl onderlying assumption 
to It he second misconception] is lhat 
univers ities and colleges are onique 
places of employment and are some-
how more tolerant, morc enlight-
ened, more ohjective and more open 
to new idea~ and perspective~ than 
institutions in the 'real world,'·' 

Nakani~hi added that ethnic and 
gender research that frequentl y 
confronts and (;halienges prevai ling 
analytical perspectives and 
explores sensitive issue of racISm 
" has yet to be fully accepled and 
embraced as important, relevant or 
exciting subjects of study by many 
faculty members." 

The third misconception is that 
Asian-American professors who 
encounter problem~ in their 
employment or promotion are more 
IndmeJ than olher minority-group 
facull Y Illelllher~ to walk away and 
not conte~t an unfair denial of 
lenure or promotion, he says. 

"Asian-Pacific American~ in 
gcnera l and Asian-Pac ilic Ameri can 

prulcssor~ m partiwlar have been 
viewed stereolypically as passive 
and docile, and arc expected (evcn 
more than the average assistant pro-

fc~,or) to quietly fade away when it

Nakanishi said he himseli wa~

that with my love of foods and his uncanny knack for spotting a perfectly

Crushing Loss Ends 
UCSD's Winning Streak 
HEARTBREAKER: It took traveling to Compton and the 
No, 4 ranked team in Division II to finally stop the Tritons 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

Nobody said winning in Complon would 
be easy. especially siO\;e Ihe opposing side 
held Ihe top Division I( ranking in 
the Western Region and was recog-
nized as Ihe founh-besl women's 
soccer team in the land. 

To make mailers worse, il was a 
hOI , sticky, sunny day wilh the 
game starting at four in the after-
noon. 

Traveling to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills last Tuesday, the 
UCSD women's soccer team had its sights 
on the team's 21 st I:onsel:utive vil:tory, dat-
ing back to last year. Instead. the team 
endured its lirst loss of the season - a 1-0 
shutout in front of 227 fans at the hands of 
the pesky Toros. 

Still, the Tritons were not overwhelmed 
by the Division II powerhouse - a great 
indil:ator that the program can hold its own 
as the switch to Division II draws do~er. 
UCSD had just as many chanl:es to sI:ore 
agai nst the Toros, but could not I:onvert on 
this day. 

"It could have gune either way: ' ~enlOr 
~weepc r Beth Freeburg said. "We had .. ever-
al good chances to score. hUI il jU~1 (hdn 'l 
happen. IThis shows I thaI we I:an pl ay wllh 
any Division II team ." 

The two ~quads slared each other down 

in the first half, taking turns trying to feel 
each other ou\. Like a heavyweight boxing 
fight, the two soccer powerhouses went at 
each other. 

They expected a tough bailie, 
and they got one. The Tritons hung 
in the contest, but Cal State 
Dominguez Hills slruck first and 
only blood in the 68th minute of 
play when opposing forward 
Heather Rolland booted a shot 
from about 18 yards out past Triton 
junior goalkeeper Jennifer Hetland 
for the game-winner. 

The game's final statistics revealed a 
tight contest. UCSD was outshot9-7, but the 
Tritons garnered seven more comer kicks 
(9-7). Each squad was aggressive, with the 
Toros committing four more fouls than the 
Tritons ( I 1-7) - but at the final whistle, the 
lone goal stood up for the Toros and 
UCSD's.20-game winning streak had come 
to an end. 

"Thi~ wa~ a wake-up call for us," 
Freehurg said . "We thought we were good, 
hut Inow wei know we're not that good. 
[Coach Brian McManus I alway~ schedule~

Young Tritons Continue To 
Impress With Two Road Wins 
WARRIORS: UCSD comes home with solid 5-2 record 
By Travfs Hili 
Sports Editor 

Maybe it's the blue and gold. Maybe it '> 
having some of the best practice facilities in 
the country. Maybe it 's the nice weather. 
Whatever it is, ii's working. 

This was supposed to be the 
year that Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong would rebuild his 
UCSD men 's soccer team. Full of 
inexperienced freshmen and sopho-
mores, the Tritons were supposed 
to be vulnerable. 

So far, however, the Tritons 
have been quite solid as they racked 
up IwO road victories last week, The wins 
brought their season record up to 5-2. 

Last Wednesday, the Trilons traveled 10 
Southern California College to battle a 
strong Vanguard squad - and whal a bailie 
it was. It was a defensive struggle through-
out, but the Triton defense was up to thl.! 
challenge. Junior sweeper John Brandon 
and freshman Robert Bessler led the way, 
with freshman goa lkeeper Lucas Curtolo 
continuing his impressive play in the net. 

The game wa, scoreless until latc in th\! 
first half when non\! other than Cameron 
Adal11~ put the Trilons on the txlard. Th\! 
team's d\!l'e nse mad\! it ~ goal siand up. and

dcfen~\! ha~ been ,o lid all year, ~" the 
Tntons have now won three games hy a nar-

row 1-0 margin . 
"We played a great game againsl 

I oUlhern California College!." Brandon 
said. "It was a great win for us. It wa~ a hard 
game. They 're a good team, and they had a 

lot of pride on Ihe line." 
Last Friday. the Tritons traveled 

to Oc(;idental Co llege for an aller· 
noon tilt with the Tigers., 
Armslrong 's boys wer\! more than 
ready for the woeful Oxy squad. 

Adams led oIl the scori 'lg with 
his fi fth goal of the year, and the 
Tritons never looked back. They 
dominated the game from endline to 

endline, and when th\! dusl had settled, 
UCSD had a 7-0 victory. 

The game was highlighled by a pair of 
goals from freshman midficlder Dana Cariss 
and a penalty-kick goal by freshman for-
ward Tyler Thompson. 

UCSD now appears 10 be ready for a bru-
tal stretch of three tough gam\!s In live days 
Ihal will have a hug\! IInpal.! t on its playoff 
slluallon.

When the Tritons took the floor 

at RIMAC fo r the first game, they

any Iype of upset. Point Lorna 
stormed out of the gatcs, and it 
looked as if UCSD would be home 
hcfore "Seinfeld" afte r the 
Crusader~ took the first gamc 15-4. 

As the teams exchanged sides of 
Ihe court , Ihe Tritons transformed 
themselvcs into an entirely differ-
enl and much improvl!d squad. The 
Triton offcn~c, which had slum bled

Cross Country Rolls In Riverside 
WHEELS: Weekend meet at UC Riverside turns into Triton b1owout as the men's and women's squads rack up two wins

It'~ a good thing the cross I:oun-

from the West Coast, from 
Division 1. II and III, as

both men and women have

This weekend the Triton )quad

competitor, Claremont-

runner across the linish

As only the top five runners

Witne~~ to Ihls mass of 
spectators was unranked 
Loyola Marymounl 
University, who came 10 
town Friday night with the 
hopes of upselling the No. 
9 ranked UCSIJ Tritons. 

They ditln 't figure on a 
trl'mendolls fan turnout , 
however. which sparked a 

UCSO win gIving Ihe ~quaJ a 3-8 
record overall. De~rile their suh-
.500 recortl, Ihe Tntons are in the 
midsl of a two-gante winning 
!ltreak and are gaining momentum 
for more important games down Ihe 

road. 
The Tritons gol off 10 a l>fow 
~tart in the first quarter, although 
Ihey heltlthc lead for the duralton 
of the game. They slruggled early 
wilh their outside shooting, a prob-
lem that has plagued them through-
out the early season. In addition, 
the Tritons have been hesitanl to 
take the ball and pUI il away, opting 
instead 10 pass the ball around the

"We can't hel>itale," sophomore

because il I~ early in Ihe posses-

line between hes itation and 
palience, and I Ihink we have been 
hesitating too much." 

DefenSIvely, UCSD's scrappi-
ness was more than LMU could 
handle. 

With senior Adam Bollenbach 
and sophomore Ross Mecham 
splitting time at the hole scI 
defense position, LMU could hard-
ly get an entry pass into its big 
man, let alone score a goal. 
Consequently, LMU scored only 
four points in the game. 

By Ihe half, Coach Denny 
Harper's team had amassed a six-
poinl lead wilh a score of 8-2. 

In Ihe second quarter, the 
Tritons lit up the LMU goalie with
