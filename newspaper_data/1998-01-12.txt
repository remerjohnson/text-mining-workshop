UCSD Hosts Forum on Asian Economies 
PANEL: Professors 
explain reasons behind 
the recent crisis in Asia 
By Ryan Olson 
Co-News Editor 

The drastic and sudden down-
turn of several Asian economies 
has left many questions regarding 
its cau es. Several professor gath-
ered Thursday at the Robin on 
Auditorium to find the answers 

The di scussion entitled "What 
Happened to the A ian Economic 
Miracles?" consi . ted of four 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies (IRIPS) professors and one 

visiting professor from Thailand. 
Professor Andrew MacIntyre 

outlined the economic situation in 
Indonesia and several reasons why 
it declined so rapidly. MacIntyre 
cited several events that were piv-
otal in the economic troubles, 
including many Indonesians 
inability to pay back loans as well 
as concerns about the health of the 
nation's president. 

Last week the rupiah , 
Indonesi<l 's currency, was trading 
at 8,200 to the U.S. dollar after 
President Suharto 's budget pro-
posal was rejected. Six months 
ago, the rupiah was trading at 
2,500 to the U.S. dollar. 

MacIntyre pointed out that each 
nation has its own economic sys-
tem and therefore, the solutions for 
one nation are not necessarily the 
solutions for others. 

"There has never been one sin-
gle Asian miracle," MacIntyre 
said. 

Professor Euysung Kim dis-
cussed the economi troubles that 
befell South Korea. Kim said the 
troubles can be traced to the first 
econ mic quarter of 1995, when 
many Korean corporations bor-
rowed money to finance huge 
expansion which created a 
tremendous debt ratio.

RESEARCH: Veins & 
arteries are now made 
without synthetics 
By S. Javan Wygal 
Staff Writer 

Scientists from UCSD and the 
Laval University of Medicine in 
Quebec, Canada have engineered 
blood-vessel tissue entirely from 
cells that can withstand the rigors 
of transplantation into the human 
body. Previous attempts have 
relied on synthetic material as 
scaffolding. 

"The blood vessels display the 
function, look and feel of real tis-
sue," said Nicholas L'Heureux, a 
bioengineering post-doctoral fel-
low at the UCSD School of 
Engineering and the primary 
author of the study. 

L'Heureux, Lucie Germain, 
Raymond Labbe and Francois 
Auger conducted the research -
funded over the past three years by 
the Heart and Stroke Foundation of 
Quebec - at the Laboratoire 
d'Organogcnese Experimentale at 
Laval. They published their find-
ings in the January journal of the 
Federation of American Societies 
for Experimental Biology. 

L'Heureux, Auger and Germain 
hold a patent on the, invention, 
which has been issued to Laval 
University. 

Although the work was cen-
tered around the creation of viable

Sign Language 
Gains Popularity 

ETCE·I'EKA •• ~ 
UNGUISTICS: Number of students taking ASL 
courses to fulfill language requirements is on the rise 
By Jenny Nicholson tries. 
Senior SllIff Writer 

Many UCSD students are learn-
ing that there is more than one way 
to communicate. The American 
Sign Language (ASL) program, 
instituted last fall , is increasingly 
popular on campus. 

"People become fascinated with 
ASL as a result of exposure," 
Schane suggests. "They see inte{-
preters for the deaf and realize that 
ASL is a valid language." 

Furthermore, many students are 
interested in the ASL program 
because of career opportunities 
connected with the ability to com-
municate through sign language. 

Classes in ASL are the 
Linguistic Language Program's 
third most popular class, after 
Spanish and 
French. Compared 
to last fall's figures, 
the ASL courses 
experienced a 40-
percent rise in 
enrollment, com-
pared to a 25-per-
cent rise in students 
taking Spanish. 
French course 
enrollment 
increased 20 per-
cent.

Professor Sanford 
Schane, director of

requirements .

Director ing. 
Ungulstlcs Language Program The popularity 

"ASL enroll-
ments seem to be fairly robust in 
those colleges that otTer it," Schane 
said. 

Schane also attributes ASL's 
rise in popularity to increased 
recognition of and exposure to the 
deaf community. 

' 'There is an increased aware-
ness that there is a sizable deaf 
community in the U.S.," Schane 
said. "People are begiMing to real-
ize that ASL is a full-fledged lan-
guage that merits study the same as 
any other language." 

Schane said the lime has come 
for UCSD to include ASL as a rec-
ognized component of the linguis-
tics program. 

''The ASL program is something 
UCSD should have been doing 
much earlier," Schane said. "We're 
kind of behind the times." 

Schane suggests that students 
are further drawn to ASL because 
of its familiarity; students are 
exposed to the deaf community 
more frequently than to other coun-

of the ~SL pro-
gram can also be attributed to the 
instructors who strive to make the 
language more accessible to stu-
dents . Communications 
Professors Carol Padden and Tom 
Humphries - both deaf - are the 
faculty consultants for the ASL 
program. 

Schane said that students liking 
ASL can be confident of quality 
instruction. 

"ASL instructors and courses 
score the highest of all languages 
on student evaluations," Schane 
said. 

Students also have other options 
for leIming about !be deaf oonununi-
ty. Linpistics Professor David 
Perlmutter teaches UGN 7, "Sign 
Language and its Culture," which 

~plorcs the history and culture of 
the deaf community, its language and 
its litenlUre. There are also councs 
that focus on the deaf community 
offered in both the Communication 
Department and the Teacher 
Education Program. 

The Department of Theatre and Dance will host the 
opening of the Dance Studio Facility in the UCSD 
Theatre District tomorrow at 3 p.m. 

Completion of the building, designed by interna-

New state anti~smoking 

law blatantly violates 

the few existing rights of 

those individuals who 

choose to smoke 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Same e~cremcnt, different day. Thc New Year 
was not even a minute old when the meddlt:some 
politicians were oncc again enacting irksome legis-
lation 10 limit peoples' freedoms. 

The latest intrusion on hasic rights. as of January 
I , hans smoking in all public Oars ilnd restaurants 
in California. While disguised as a health concern. 
the real issue is the gov~rnment's trampling of pri -
vate property rights. 

Before you conspiracy theorists get going, I' ll 
start with this disdaimer: I do not smoke cigarettes, 
never have smoked cigarettcs and have accepted no 
money to speak on behalf of those evil tooacco 
companies. I do smoke an occasional cigar. and 
oncc in a while, cven a pipe (that's a tobacco pipe 
for thuse uf yuu who an: unsure - one is nut even 
supposed 10 inhale out of one of those). I personal-
ly lind cigarette smoke distasteful, and will proha-
bly cnjoy going out morc if thc han is successfully 
enforced. 

However, I am staunchly opposed to the ban 
hecause it deprives bar owners of the right to deter-
mine the activities they wish to allow on their prop-
erties. Regardless of what the politicians think, 
Ameril:an adults do not need governmental wet 
nurses micromanaging their lives to make sure they

If a bar ~l wner wants to allow smoking in his 
establishment, that should be his decision. If you, 
the patron, are offended by smoke, tough noogies. 
Don't go in. No om: is forcing you to go into the 
establishment. If you. as a patron, hatc smoking that 
hadly and do not wish to he cxposed to cigarette 
smoke, si mply do not patronize establishments 
whose owners allow or em:ourage smoking on the 
premises. 

As for employees, no one is forl:ing them to 
work in those smoke-friendly environs. They are 
not serfs nor indentured servants tied to I:crtain 
employers, and the skills required to do that type of 
work arc not sjX'l.:ialized. There are other jobs avai 1-
ahle to those who do not wish to be exposed to 
smoke. 

Pcople generally go to bars to engage in their 
favorite vkes - and many of them count smoking 
among their guilty pleasures. Thus, there is a 
demand for places in which they can indulge 
themselves. Business owners arc simply respond-
ing to that demand when they allow people to 
smoke their cigarettes in the dulls. bars and 
restaurants. 

Conversely. if there is a large demand for 
smoke-free bars, dubs will open up in which the 
owner chooses to han smoking to ,satisfy that 
demand. It is a very simple mailer of econumics. If

THERE'S 

Government has a responsibility to better the working 
environment of bars and clubs for patrons and employees 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sellior Staff Writer 

It's official. On January I, 1998, California became the 
first U.S. state to make all bars and clubs smoke-free. 
Heated conversations and furious debates have exploded 
onto the air waves and around the water cooler since the ban 
took elTect a couple of weeks ago. 

As an employee who has had to deal with the "blue 
haze" myself. I could not be happier. Every individual has 
the right to smoke if he chooses, the government cannot ban 
that right. W_hen smoking puts others in danger, however, 
th", government should take action to protect those employ-
ees who face hazardous effects from the toxic fumes every 
day. 

Many bar patrons throughout the state, however, say 
they intend to keep puffing while downing their beers, wine 
and spirits, and many bar owners - feeling a potential drop 
in business - say they intend to let them. 

" It is frustrating that the state is telling us how to con-
duct Ilusiness," said Mike Stange. manager of Mil:hael 's 
Loung(! at the Hyall Regency La Jolla. "But on the other 
hand, it will be nice to have a smoke-free environment. 
Fortunately. we have the luxury of an outside patio, where 
we can allow our guests who enjoy a tine cigar the oppor-
tunity to smoke at our establishment. Personally. I really do 
not care one way or the othcr, but since thc law has been 
passed, it is my responsibility to abide by it." 

If you arc a smoker and wish to break the law, don't plan 

to get away with it at my workplace. The law of the land 
should be followed and I will make every effort to enforce 
it. There's no reason why any member of society should 
feel compelled to break a law that promotes better health. 

This law is only a logical follow-up of the restaurant 
smoking ban of 1995. That law was created to protect both 
the patrons of restaurants and the employees. Why should 
bars be any different? Smoking is as toxic in a bar as it is in 
a restaurant, and the employees deserve the same healthy 
environment. 

Enforcing the law is obviously essential, and the fact 
that it is the bar owner, not the smoker, who can be penal-
ized will be effective. The fines start at $100 for the first 
offense, $200 for the second and $500 for the third, with 
subsequent violations at up to $7,000 each. With those 
kinds of fines. it is more likely that a great majority of bar 
owners and patrons will comply with the new law. 

Opponents of the ban argue that the ban is unconstitu-
tional and the government is trying to run their lives. They 
complain that it is their right to smoke and it will be impos-
sible to enforce the law. 

First of all, this law - which has become part of the 
state's labor code - is intended to protect employees in 
enclosed workplaces - not the customer. The average 
UCSD reader is fully aware of the dangers of second-hand 
smoke, so there is no need for me to bore you with an end-
less list of statistics. Both employees and customers arc

that prefers to not bc e~ posed to

Aside from encroaching on pri -

ban also deprives enterprising busi-

subjected to the harmful toxins sent 
forth by smokers and it is about 
time someone took action. 

Opponents complain that wait-
resses and bartenders were fully 
aware of the dangers of the job 
when they applied, so if they can't 
handle it, they should find another 
job. This abhorrently selfish alli-
tude only reflects the ignorance and 
greed displayed by those citizens 
who choose to smoke no mailer 

make money serving the smoking 
demographic. If smokers value the 
opportunity to smoke in bars and 
restaurants, they should be willing 
to pay a premium for the privilegc. 
Owners could charge a higher 
cover for smoking establi shments, 
or establi sh separate smoking 
rooms with eparate cover charges. 

Simply banning smoking in bars 
and restaurants removes the effi-
ciency of market forces and 
replaces it with bureaucratic bum-
bling - more government intru-
sion into mailers thm should be pri-
vate - and is mere patronizing 
from inept public officials.

rant -goers. 

Truthfully, I was aware of the 
fact that I would be subjected to 
second-hand smoke when I applied 
for the job. But it does not follow 
that my government is restrained 
from improving my work environ-
ment. 

California has always been a 
state surging ahead of others in its 
quest to make life for its inhabi -
tants a healthy one. Fitness and 
California go hand in hand. The 

'same complaints were heard in 
1995 when the aforementioned 
restaurant ban went into effect. I 
don't see too many restaurant own-

making legally binding contracts

As much as I despise cigarette

their actions cause haml to inno-

OPINION 5 

smoke, I despise intrusions on my 
freedom even more. One cannot 
simply decide that rights and free-
doms apply only to those things 
that are popular at the moment. We 
need to guard against being like the 
frog in the lukewarm water who is 
slowly boiled to death without real-
izing what is occurring - we need 
to vigorously defend all our free-
doms before we are left with none 
at all. 

To paraphrase Ben Franklin 
(another man who was never on the 
payroll of Big Tobacco): those who 
are willing to trade freedom for 
safety deserve neither. 

Suddenly, some jerk next to 
you lights up a cigarette. The 
stench is overwhelming and you 
notice your new friend is getting 
extremely agitated. You stare at 
the bartender with that look of, 
"Hey, tell this clown to get out. 
There 's no smoking allowed!" But 
the bartender just stares straight 
ahead. He doesn ' t want to lose the 
possible tip . 

So you look around for the 
owner. She's nowhere to be found , 
though. since she only comes in 
once a year. So what do you d9? 
Cause a scene and tell Mr. Jerk to 
buzz off, or wait for a California 
health official to rescue you?

The researchers hope to prove 
that this cell-created matrix can be 
recognized by the body as nonnal, 
thus eliminating the possibility of 
rejcction. The next stage will be 
tests in pigs, in which the cells will 
be taken from the same pigs into 
which the completed blood vessels 
wi II be transplanted. 

The UCSD team is working to 
make advances in the design of the 
bioreactor that will allow it to more 
closely simulate fluid flow and 
pressure inside the body. With it 
they hope to generate more com-
plex types of ti ssue. Frangos and 
L'Heureux are currently using the 
technique to allempt to enginecr 
bone ti ssue. 

"Blood vesse ls and bones are 
very si milar with the exception that 
the protei n matrix in bone mineral-
izes," Frangos said. ..to date we . 
have sucl:cssfully created a matri x 
that has the biochemical properties 
of bone, and we arc now attempting 
the harder challenge of achi eving 
mineralization." 

Researchers are also working 
toward improving on ex isting 
implants, such as skin grafts. 

The researchers technique is 
time consuming; it takes about 
four months for an entire blood 
vessel to be created. An organ as 
complex as the liver would take 
much longer. 

' The researchers are hoping to 
one day be able to work in conjune-
lion with the body, "suggesting" the 
basic arl:hiteclure for an organ and 
having the body send a signal for 
the organ to be regenerated. 

"We know that liver tissuc 
regenerates in the body, and iI 'S 
only a mailer of time before we 
find the component re ponsi ble for 
that." L'Heureux said. "Perhaps 
there will be a day when organs 
needed for transplant can be creat-
ed to order from the patient's own

"Herb taught us that we were 
more than a scienti fic organiza-
tion. we were a community ethi-
cally compelled to justly serve 
students, and to value and respect 
staff and temporary lecturers." 

Dr. Stern came from a poor 
Montreal family whose primary 
spoken language at home was 
Yiddish. Dr. Stem was not only flu-
ent in English, but in Hebrew as 
well. His family treasured educa-
tion and helped support their son's 
undergraduate years at McGill 
University, from which he graduat-
ed in 1940. 

Before graduate school, Dr. 
Stem served a term in the Royal 
Canadian Air Force in World War 
11. He continued on to earn his 
Ph.D. in plant genetics at McGill in 
1945. During the following four 
years, he worked at UC Berkeley 
and in Johannesberg, South Africa. 

After working at numerous 
institutions in the United States 
and Canada, Dr. Stern eventually 
came to UCSD where his studies 
of lilies led to a better understand-
ing of how meiosis works on the 
genetic level. He also served as 
the chair of the Academic Senate 
during the 1973-74 academic 
year. 

"He was considered by every-
one to be one of the premier pro-
fessors at UCSD," Hedrick said. 
"He gave freely of his time (0 
everyone and many people in the 
department feel they owe their 
career to him." 

Dr. Stern's numerous honors 
and achievements include being 
elected to the American Academy 
of Arts and Sciences and the Royal 
Danish Academy of Sciences. He 
also held honorary Doctor of 
Sciences degree from McGill 
University and authored or co-
authored 136 publications.

A UCSD student spends a year helping a golden retreiver puppy become 
a Canine Companion for people with disablities 

ince August 1996 Shannon Wickstrom, a Revelle 
senior, has acted as the "puppy raiser" or' 
Windman, a golden retriever, for the Canine 
Companions for Independence (CCI). Windman 
was placed in Wickstrom's care for over a year, 
during which he lived in her San Diego home and 
in the Revelle dormitories. 

Wickstrom and her family have been involved 
with CCI for a number of years. Founded in 1975, CCI is a ser· 
vice organization that trains dogs to assist people with physical 
disabilities other than blindness. There are three levels to pass for 
a puppy to become a CCI dog. 

In the first stage, at the age of eight weeks, each dog is placed 
with a puppy·raiser until it is I ~ to 1& months old. After the dog 
has been with the puppy·raiser, it is given a training course for 
six weeks with professional CCI trainers. When the dog has 
completed this course, it will go through three weeks of team 
training with an individual applying for a canine companion. 
The team training shows CCI workers whether the dog is com-
patible with the applicant. 

"Some dogs do not make it past the boot camp," Wickstrom 

said. ''They have to have a mellow disposition and work well with 
others." 

If a dog and an applicant work well together, they leave to 
start their working relationship and friendship. 

Wickstrom first became involved with CCI in second grade. 
As a member of the Bluebirds troop she had to participate in 
community service. The troop received information about CCI 
and soon grew to love the prospective Canine Companions. 

Since then Wickstrom has been actively involved with CCI. 
Her parents and younger sister also participate in the organiza· 
tion. Wickstrom's younger sister acted as a puppy raiser this past 
year . 

In August 1996, Wickstrom began training her first CCI puppy. 
Windman, a docile dog, obeys Wickstrom's every command fol · 
lowing her everywhere including to restaurants, classes and even 
grocery shopping. 

Windman wcars specific auire to distinguish him a a CCI dog. 
Windman has a gentle lead across his muzzle; it provides faster 
correction from Wickstrom but also allows Windman to have full 
acce/s to his mouth. On his back and around his body, Wind man

Who is more important-
the professor or the TA? 
Interviews by Marc Comer 
Photography by Dave Lubitz 

"The professor. Most of 
what I learn comes from 
the professor. J don't really 
interact too much with the 
TAs." 

Mike McFarlin 
Marshall Junior 

"I guess it depends on 
the class. For large lec-
tures, the TAs are a little bit 
more accessible in learn-
ing, but in smaller classes, 
the professor has a better 
grasp of the knowledge." 

Christine Kim 
Warren Senior 

"Definitely the profes-
sor. A lot of my TAs so far 
have just reiterated what 
the professor says. They 
haven ' t reall y done too 
much new. Half of the 
time, I felt like I was more 
on the ball than the T A." 

Robyn Kondrack 
Warren Freshman 

"I think the most impor-
tant part of a class is the 
lecture, and you need a 
professor that's going to 
keep you inspired and 
wanting to go to lecture. If 
you' re not going to lecture, 
you're probably not going 
to section, either." 

.ard.a .... rav .... 
Revelle Junior 

"I think the TAs are 
more important, just 
because I feel more com-
fortable with them, talking 
to ' them and having them 
explain things to me. 
Sometimes the professor 
seems so out of reach."

DOG: 
Dogs help break down 
barriers for disabled 
Continued from page 9 
wears a royal blue cape indicating that he 
helps those with physical disabilities. 

Wickstrom said that she would welcome 
strangers questions about Windman. 

"1 do wish people would ask more ques-
tions about Windman and CCI ," Wickstrom 
said. "I'd like to help out with information 
concerning cel. to show that it 's not a see-
ing-eye dog organization but more just for 
anyone with physical handicaps." 

CCl trains three types of dogs. Service 
dogs perform tasks for people with physical 
disabilitie • such as turn ing on and off light 
switches. pushing elevator bUllons, retriev-
ing items and pulling wheelchairs. Hearing 
dogs alert people who are deaf or hearing-
impaired to crucial sounds, such as a tele-
phones, alarm clock, smoke alarm or a 
baby's cry. Social dogs are provided for 
children with di sabilities. individuals with 
developmental di sabilities or for any situa-
tion where the supervision of a third party i 
required. 

CCl primarily uses go lden retrievers. 
Labrador retrievers. border collies and 
Pembroke Welsh dogs for their organi zation. 
Although most dogs come from CCI's selec-
tive breeding program. dogs donated to the 
program are accepted if they meet stri ct qual-
ification requirement . 

Windman was named in honor of a cou-
ple who dedicated a lengthy portion of their 
time to the CCI organization . Many dogs in 
CCI are named after sponsors and in honor 
of respected persons. Since CCl is a non-

. profit organi zation and receives no govern -
ment funding. this establishmen t relies on 
group and service club contributions. grants 
and fundraising events. 

Wi cks trom, along with all the othe r 
puppy raisers involved with CCI. volunteers 
not only her time hut also some of her finan -
cial resources. The average cos t of raising a 
Canine Companion for 15 to 18 months is at 
least $ 1,000. 

The puppy raisers receive no financial 
help. Wickstrom enjoys taking care of 
Wind man and sees the financial costs as an 
appropriate part of her responsibility of taking 
care of Windman . 

"Windman is my sidekick." Wickstrom 
said . "He goes everywhere with me and I 
like having a ca lm, willing partner to hang 
out with." 

According to Wickstrom. the most com-
mon way CC I dogs help is by breaking bar-
riers for the physically disabled . The 
increased ilJdependcnce that CCI dogs pro-
vide for handicapped people enable them to 
lead more socially fufi lling li ves . 

"People are more approachable with a 
dog. and it is hard to depend on people to 
help." Wickstrom said . " It is commonly eas-
ier for peoplc wilh disabilities to depend on 
dogs for assi stance with their daily necessi-
ties ." 

Monika Kobylecko/Guarclian 
On the go: Shannon Wickstrom leads 
her CCI trainee out of the Revelle dorms. 

CCI welcomes individuals with a desire 
to be puppy-raisers. "They do evaluate 
you." Wickstrom said . "They investigate 
your house and background to ensure that 
you will adequately take care of the dog. but 
you don ' t have to have any credentials to 
become a puppy-raiser." 

Windman finished the first stages of hi s 
training with Shannon during this past 
November. Next he wi ll go on to work with 
speciall y trained CCI trainers for a six-week 
crash course. 

"I am goi ng to miss him terribly." 
Wickstrom said. "I love dogs and thi s is such 
an awesome organization. CCI scrves the dis-
abled community and I enjoy being a partici-
pant." 

For those interes ted in a Canine 
Companion there is a minimal fee and appl i-
cation procedure. Contact the nati onal head-
quarters to request an applicati on.

Hot Tritons Burn Two More Foes 
TORCHING THE TWINE: UCSD hosted and won the La 10lla Classic, raising its win streak to 10 
By Kevin MclMlChlln 
CoAssociatB Sports Editor 

If you have won a couple of 
games in a row, you are getting 
wann. If you win four or five in a 
row, you are heating up. 
But if you win 10 games 
consecutively, you ·f.re 
positively on fire. 

Such is tlTe case with 
men's basketball, a squad 
bolstered by the addition 
of a true center and a 
team that has really found 
the range from outside. 

Following Saturday night's 98-
88 win over Robert Morris 
College (111.) , the men's team 
improved to 11,-4 on the season 
and won the 20th La lalla 
Basketball Classic. 

Playing in RIMAC Arena has 
helped the squad. Since losing 
four straight on the road, the team 
returned home and has not lost a 
game since. 

Friday night, the Tritons 
opened the four-team tournament 
against cross-town NAIA foe , 
Point Lorna Nazarene College. 
The Crusaders came into the game 
in trouble and they weren't going 
to get any help frum their hostile 
hosts. 

Point Lorna entered with a 1-15 
record and has lost five players to 
various problems during the sea-
son. Forced to suit up three players 
from the baseball team to have 
eight on its roster, Point Lorna 

never really had a chance. 
The game was actually tied at 

42 at the half, but the Tritons went 
on a tear in the early minutes of 
the second half, building a lead of 

65-50 behind some pres-
sure defense and a good 
dose of Triton medicine, 
the three-pointer. 

In a valiant effort for 
Point Lorna, Cornelius 
Thompson scored 36 
points and center Nathan 
Miller had 24 points and 
13 rebounds, but it was 

far from enough. As the clock ran 
down, UCSD continued to pull 
away, finally beating the 
Crusaders for the second time this 
season, 120-91. 

In Saturday night's final, the 
Tritons were pitted against NAIA 
member Robert Morris College of 
Chicago, which came into the 
game with a record of 9-8. Though . 
athletic, the Eagles lacked the 
height and the sweet shooting 
touch of the home team. 
Eventually, it showed. 

UCSD continued its recent run 
of good shooting, knocking down 
51 percent of its shots in the game. 
The team hit on 6 of 11 three-point 
attempts in the first half, whi Ie 
jumping out to a 52-42 halftime 
lead that it would not relinquish. 

The lead closed to as little as 
four late in the second half due to 
an effective zone defense 
employed by Morris, but the rein-

Associated Students, 534-4450 

sertion of the starting five resulted 
in a surge that kept the Tritons out 
of danger. 

Dan Almquist and Nick 
Maroutsos provided some pop off 
the bench, putting in a .:ombined 
six three-pointers. Tyler Garratt 
scored 15 points in both Friday 
and Saturday night's games, earn-
ing All-Tournament status.

the jump shot. 

"The reason why we're shoot-

and two, we're getting more quali-
ty shots," Triton Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier said. "I like our chances 
at home no matter who we're play-

well. the Steelers would be book.ing 
tickets to San Diego. If not. well, 
we all saw that part. The Steelers 
live and die by Stewart and yester-
day he sunk the playoff boat all by 
himself. 

You know, I love Stewart and I 
think he might be the most physi-
cally-gifted athlete in the game 
today, but where the hell is his 
brain? I mean really, how dumb is 
this kid? He made some of the 
worst decisions I've seen since the 
Neil O'Donnell Super Bowl snafu. 

As for the spectacle that was the 
Niner-Packer game, it was, well, I 
guess the nicest way to say it would 
be ugly. I hate both teams almost as 
much as Latrell Sprewell and fresh 
necks to choke. 

So for me, the game held no 
value - much like the newly 
anointed Super Bowl matchup. The 
Broncos and the Packers - be still, 
my black-and-gold heart. Oh well, 
at least now I don't really have to 
pay attention to the game and can 
concentrate on drowning my bitter 
sorrows.

The

Travis Hili 
Let's Be Honest: 
Yesterday Sucked 

This is the kind of day yes-
terday was: I got up way too 
early and found myself not even 
hung over yet, because I was 
still in a dru nken haze. Here I 
must give a good fri end of mine 
props, because he drove me 
home in the morning. He is a 
trooper, a real superstar. 

Anyway, I oozed onlO my 
couch and tried to cheer for the 
Steelers without di sturbing my 
excrucia ting headache. Then. 
not only did my favorit e team 
lose, but after the game when I 
went to "the reading room" as I 
like to call it , I got trapped in 
there with no freaking toilet 
paper! 

What I'm not so tastefully 
trying to say is, YESTERDAY 
SUCKED. Not only for me, the 
Steeler fan, but for the large 
population of NoCals, who saw 
their beloved 4gers beaten as 
well . 

I can just hear some idiot 
now, "But Coach, they didn't 
suck if you arc a Broncos or a 
Packers fan" (this quote is to be 
said in the tone of, "But 
Ironhead, what's with this 
thingy?"). 

Screw that. The Sports 
Section as a whole is bitter, and 
you guys are going to hear about 
it. 

For those of you who don ' t 
know, I am a rabid Steeler fan . 
More than rabid - insane 
might be a better way to put it. 
How insane? When I was in 
kindergarten, I was watching a 
Steeler game. They got scored 
on, and I promptly reacted with 
a few choice words. Then my 
loving mother promptly reacted 
by taking me to the bathroom 
sink and shoving a bar of soap 
in my mouth - that 's right, she 
literally placed the bar of soap 
in my mouth. 

Of course, her tactics did not 
werk, because I soon developed 
one of the foulest mouths on the 
playground, but my wacky 
childhood is a different col-
umn ... 

Back to the games yesterday 
and the fact that they sucked. 
Looking at it objectively, both 
games were exciting and close, 
which is usually a positive 
thing. But when you're on the 
edge of your seat for three-and-
a-half hours only to have your 
team not go to a uper Bowl 
that's goi ng to be held in your 
own backyard is one of the 
deepe!)t wounds th at can be 
dea lt to an insane sport · fan . 

Thl' Stee ler-Bronco ga me 
hinged on one thing - not John 
Elway, not the Jerome "The 
Bu " Bettis, not the respective 
defen es. It cam down to 
Kordell Stewart . If he played

Pass It Around: Junior guard Amy McClure looks to pass over a befuddled defender. UCSD has shown no signs of slowing up despite 
the mid-season departure of stalwart Karli Jungwirth, as the team has won four straight, including a 59-50 win over Ottawa Thursday. 

STEP BY STEP: A new group 
of stars is continuing UCSD's 
annual run at the postseason 
By Jeff Bassett 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball tearn can 
see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's there, 
tantalizing, urging them forward by any means 
possible. The light? An invitation to 
the NCAA playoffs. 

The NCAA hasn 't made it easy for 
the Tritons this year, as only six teams 
from the West Coast will be asked to 
participate. Nevertheless, the Tritons 
are hoping to be a part of Marcfl 
Madness. 

Given their desire to bask in the 
light, Thursday's game against Ottawa 
University (Kan.) was a must-win. Not only did 
the Tritons need to add an II th victory to their 
resume, but a loss to the 0- 11 Braves would 
have seriously hindered the team\ postseason 
chances. 

The women's basketball team ( ok one step 
closer to the CAA playoffs on Thursday 
night , di '"rding the Braves 59-5 . On a night 
when the Tritons strugg led offcn~ive l y, shoot-
ing only I percent from the n or, it was th..: 
defcn ive effort of Head Coach Judy Malone' 
troops that secured the victory. The team forced 

Ottawa into committing 31 turnovers, resulting 
in 19 more shots on the offensive end. 

Amy Franzen led the defensive effort with a 
team high four steals, while Krista Poehler and 
Ashley Kokjohn each contributed three steals 
as well. 

The Tritons limited the Braves to only II 
offensive rebounds, as the trio of Summer 
Begley, Kate Turnbull and Genevieve Ruvald 
controlled the defensive boards. 

The women jumped out quickly, 
e tablishing an eight-point cushion 
with less than five minutes gone in the 
first hal f. 

The offensive surge was led by the 
usual suspects: Jenessa Bayda contin-
ued her torrid three-poi nt shooting, 
hitting two of her first three from 
downtown; Poehler broke down the 
Braves with her dribble, drivi ng for 

multiple lay-ups and short jumpers; Tristen 
Teasdale also pitched in, hitting two jumpers 
from ju t in ide the three-point arc. 

More importantly, the team's press limited 
the Braves to just 25 shots in the first half, 
resulting in a 35-27 Triton halftime lead. 

The start of the second half boiled down to 
a conlest between two players, the Tritons 
Franzen and the Braves' Melvetlu Mann ing. 
Manning opened the coring, drai ning a three-
pointer that cut the UCSD lead to 35-30. 
Franzen responded with a jumper, pushing the 

advantage to seven. Manning, not to be out-
done, split two Triton defenders and converted 
an open lay-up. Franzen once again countered, 
putting back her own offensive rebound. 

The next two baskets went to the Braves' 
Candie Linley, and the Tritons' cushion was 
down to a mere three points. 

As they have done all ' season, the Tritons 
responded. Poehler's bucket, sandwiched 
between two Kokjohn jumpers, pushed the lead 
back up to nine. 

The team continued to harass the Braves 
with its full -court press, and despite the noble 
efforts of both Manning and Lindley (30 com-
bined points), the Braves were unable to chip 
into the Triton lead. 

The final minutes of the game resembled 
more of a hack-a-thon than a basketball game. 
The Brave , realizing that an 0-12 start was in 
their near future, fouled the Triton guards at 
virtually every opportunity. Unaffec ted, 
Malone's troop. confidently converted from 
the charity stripe, ending any Braves' hope of a 
comeback. 

At 11 -3, the Tritons arc in position to make 
a run at the playoffs. Despile its strong slart, the 
women' team has many potential pitfalls 
ahead of it. 

The Tritons ' next home game, this Saturday 
against arch rival Chapman, hould prove to be 
an excellent indicator as to whether March will 
be the postseason or off-season.
