Absentee Regents no 
longer promanagement 

The University of Califomia 
Regents will have access to more 
information before voting on 
stockholder issues of social or 
moral concem under a new 
policy approved Friday. Jan. 17. 

In the past. Regents who did 
not vote on proxy issues were 
counted as voting for 
managemenr and against the 
stockholder issue. Under the 
new proxy voting policy, the 
Regents will receive advice from 
the University Advisory 
Committee for Investor 
Responsibility (UACIR) before 
voting on such issues. The 
UACIR is composed of staff, 
faculty and sTUdent 
representatives. It was formed 
last June to monitor the 
corporate citizenship of 
companies in which UC invests 
which do business in South 
Africa. 

The Regents, meeting at UC 
San Francisco-Laurel Heights. 
agreed to changes in the way 
they cast proxy votes. Under the 
new policy, only Regents actually 
submitting votes will be counted 
as voting on issues of social 
concem. The treasurer will vote 
the proxy on the basis of the 
majority of those voting. 

The review of proxy voting 
policy was prompted last June 
when the Regents exammed 
their investml'nt policy in liRht 
of conce ms abOUt investing In 

compani~.s which do some of 
their busi ness in South Africa. 
Th~ resolution which established 
the UACIR also directed the 
group to consider ways of 
Improving the University'S 
exercise of its shareholding 
VOting rights. 

As in the past, the treasurer is 
Instructed to vote for 

BLOOM COUNTY 

management on proxy issues of 
a business management nature. 

Thinking beyond war 
"A World Beyond War" will -be the 
topic of d iscussion Friday and Mr. 
&: Mrs . Donald Lundgren , 
coordinators for the Beyond War 
Foundation in San Diego will be 
the feaTUred speakers for the 
Forum. The forum is free and open 
to the public and is sponsored by 
the University Extension 's 
InstiTUte for Continued Learning. It 
will be Friday, Jan 24 at 10 am in 
classroom 122 of the UCSD 
Extension complex. The Beyond 
War Foundation has about 500 
full-time and 8,000 pan-time 
volunteers working on educational 
programs in the United States and 
several fortign coumries. 

The latest line 
on research 

The University of California 
Board of Regents formally 
established the lnstitue for 
Nonlinear Science at UCSD at its 
monthly meeting Friday in San 
Francisco. 

"I'm delighted the Regents 
have approved this organized 
research unit, which on an 
informal level has been active at 
UCSD for about twO yeal'S ," said 
Dr. Harold Ticho, UCSD vice 
chancellor for academic affairs. 
··It will be an interdisciplinary 
research unit with the fields of 
participating faculty and 
researchers ranging from 
psychiatry and cardiology 
through phYSICS. chemistry, 
engineering and oceanography 
all the way to the purest kind of 
mathematics," Ticho said . 

onlinear science is the study 
of processes in narure and the 
laboratory that at first glance 

appear to be chaotic . However, 
in the apparent chaos . scientists 
are now beginning to find 
discemible pa ttems, according to 
Henry Abarbanel , coordinator of 
the proJect. 

Some of the nonlinear 
processes under investigation by 
UCSD scientists are TUrbulence 
in the oceans and in nuclear 
fusion reactors , the motion of 
waves at sea, and complex 
biological systems with periodic 
behavior, such as a beating heart. 
This class of problems has been 
resistant to scientific analysis , 
but the advent of relatively 
inexpensive , high-speed 
computers has changed research 
methods, Abaranel said . 

UCSD's new institute is a 
branch of a systemwide network 
involving similar efforts at the 
UC campuses at Davis, Berkeley, 
Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara and 
Los Angeles and the Center for 
Nonlinear Srudies at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, 
which is operated by the 
university. The UCSD center is 
the second to receive the 
Regents' approval. 

Give more blood 
Muir College sponsors a blood 

drive affiliated with the San 
Diego blood bank on Friday Jan. 
24 from 11:30 to 4:30. All donors 
will receive a bloodmobile T-shirt 
for their donations which can be 
given at the Muir Quad 
Apartment lounge next to the 
Muir Bloodmobile. Adviser Blue 
Robbins hopes for panicipation 
by studenrs, faculty and staff. 

Facts to ponder 
Did you know that is costs 

$9000 to advertise for one 
second on the Cosby Show? 

Do you know the percentage 
of Americans who say they had a 
pizza delivered in the last three 
months? 40 percent. 

Do you know that the chances 
are that only one American in 
five has eaten a bagel?

Nobel laureate 
Tutu will speak 
By PHIL HAMPTON, Daily Nexus 
cSt ANNA SORENSEN. UCSD Guardian. 

Bishop Desmond Tutu will 
speak today at 3 pm in the main 
gymnasium. The Anglican bishop 
of Johannesburg is the recipient 
of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. 

He claims he is not a pacifist, 
bur a "peace lover." 

"I believe that the strategy of 
non-violence succeeds where 
there is a minimal moral 
standard," he says. His message 
is that non-violence is the best 
way to social order. He 
denounces the oppression of 
people of one color by those of 
anOther. 

In a talk Tuesdav at UCSB, 
Bishop Desmond Tutu said the 
most realistic option to dismancle 
the South African apartheid 
regime depends on the 
willingness of the "intemation::.l 
community," particularly the 
United States, to pressure the 
white minority government.

Tutu told an audience of about 
5,500 that other vehicles for 
abolishing apartheid are either 
impossible, undesirable or 
unrealistic. 

"I am at a loss to understand 
why, when the French, the 
Germans, and Dutch were 
resisting Nazism, they were 
lauded to the skies as great 
heroes and heroines, as 
understandably they were, Tutu 
said . 

He continued , "(But) when it 
comes to black liberation , quite 
extraordinarily. the West wakes 
up and finds it has suddenly 
gone all-pacifist" 

"Those who invest in South 
Africa ought to know quite 
clearly. whether they like it or 
nOt, that they are supporting 
one of the most vicious systems 
the world has ever known."

Students set new protocol 
By BARI SCHLESINGER 

A GROUP OF 30 students 'from Cali'fomia will tour Nicaragua this 
spring as part of a project 
intended to improve relations 
between Nicaragua and the 
United States. 

This trip is organized by the 
UC STUdents' Association 
(UCSA), formerly the Student 
Body Presidents' Council (SBPC), 
a systemwide committee of 
representatives from each 
campus' AS Council. 

to learn about Nicaragua . The six 
delegates and 24 observers will 
discuss what they leamed on the 
trip and will possibly be joined 
by knowledgeable profeSSionals 
from Califomia and Washington. 
D.C. 

sent to the Nicaraguan 
government, toO, "but it is up to 
the Nicaraguan students," Fado 
said. 

The goal, according to Fado, is 
for Congress, and the world . to 
recognize three points: that 
students do have an impact 
when working together, that 
peace needs to be defined, 
starting with the individual and 
working toward the communities; 
and that conflicts can be 
resolved through negotiation. 

The delegates and observers 
participating in this project will 
be chosen through arT 
application consisting of an 
essay, resume and information 
sheet. The delegates will be 
interviewed on Jan. 25 and 26. 
Those chosen will be "analytical. 
have well developed 
communication skiDs and be 
open-r,ninded," Pozzo said. 

The students will participate 
in the Protocol for Peace Project 
which consists of three phases: 

the Student Delegation to 
Nicaragua, March 12-22, 1986; 
the UC Systemwide Peace 
Conference, April 5. 1986 at UC 
Berkeley; and the UC/Nicaragua 
Negotiations, from April 7-May I, 
1986 at UC Davis. 

The students will attend a 
training seminar during the 
weekend of Feb. 26, 1986 and a 
press conference on the day of 
departure , according to Fado. 
During the layover in Mexico, 
the STUdents afso will meet with 

Plea!e tum to page 7 "Most of the support comes 
from UC Davis," said UCSD 
UCSA representative Greg 
Amold . 

The purpose of the project, 
Protocol for Peace, is to acquire 
information to bring back in 
order to educate the 
communities about Nicaragua, 
according to Colette Pozzo. 
Associated Student's vice-
president at UC Davis. 

The six delegates from 
Californ ia and the six from 
Nicaragua will then hold a 
"round table" discussion. 
supervised by UC faculty. and 
prod uce a Declaration of 
Negotiations. They wiu debate 
such issues as "economic trade, 
intemationallaw, international 
debt, sovereignty of nations, 
and/or national ideolOgies," said 
Patty Fado, UC Student Body 
Presidents' Council 
representative at UC Davis and 
organizer of the three-week 
negotiation proceedings. 

INS bus patrol stirs protest 

While in Nicaragua, the 
students will have the 
opportunity to meet with 
government officials and leaders 
of the opposition . The meetings 
will be coordinated through the 
U.S. State Department . . 

The pamphlet regarding the 
project stated the students will 
also be guided through different 
regions of Nicaragua. 

Following the trip, a 
systemwide peace conference 
will be held. The Peace 
Conference. according to Pozzo, 
is to allow the communities and 
students who are unable to 
partici pate in the. actual project 

For each of the topics, a 
knowledgeable speaker will 
provide information , Fado said . 
The main goal of the 
negotiations, however, is to 
"provide an academic arena to 
fac ilitate cross-cultural 
communication, to promote the 
utilization of the negotiation 
process and to document how a 
peaceful setclement may be 
obtained between two nations at 
war," the packet stated. 

The results will then be sent, 
in petition form, to all the 
universities of the United States 
to be signed accordingly. At the 
begi nning. of the 1986/ 1987 
school year, the statement will be 
sem to the United States 
Congress. It will hopefully be

T HE SAN DIEGO Transit Authority was notified twO months ago that 
Immigration and Naturalization 
Service agents would board buses 
in the La Jolla area to investigate 
resident complaints against 
alleged burglary attempts by 
illegal aliens , a spokesman for SD 
Transit said Friday. 

"(The INS) is responding to 
resident complaints of illegal 
aliens in the La Jolla area ," Mark 
Lowthian, of San Diego TranSit 
said. 

However, the boarding of 
buses and the questioning of 

. passengers is routine procedure, 
said an INS official. 

Spot checks on public 
transportation are "always 
successful ," said Ed Pyeatt, an 

INS supervisor. 
"We've had over 6,000 
apprehensions in the airport 
area alone ... (the checks) are 
very productive," he said. 

Increased activity in the La 
Jolla area could be due to limited 
staff at the INS, Pyean said . 

"We have to bounce around ... 
we can't become predictable (if 
we want to be successful): he 
said. 

Investigation procedures by 
the INS have raised 
discrimination complaints by 
Chicano STUdents, who claim 
border patrol agents targer 
"brown skinned" male youths for 
questioning, according to 
members of a Chicano student 
organization on campus. 

"The students of UCSD have a 

responsibility to educate citizens 
and cenain STUdents that they 
are discriminated against 
because of the color of their 
skins," said Richard Castellanos, 
a Revelle junior, "It's like a hit 
squad ... it's obvious they use 
phenotypes (to target 'people for 
questioning). " 

MEChA a Chicano student 
organization, has recently set up 
a committee to investigate 
discrimination complaints and to 
increase student awareness of 
the problem, 'Castellanos said. 
The committee, still in the 
planning stages, is a small 
student group aimed at getting 
the INS out of the campus area, 
said Juan Cavarrubias, a member 
of the organization.

But can Comm pay the rent? 
Does UC San Diego supply its students with a marketable education? If you're an 

engineer or computer scientist the answer would be yes, but if you're a 
communication major you may not be too sure. The idea of intrudllcing a 
journalism major to the university's curriculum or offering courses through the 
communication department has run head on into the state's Master Plan for Higher 
Education. The fight is between teaching theory, which is designated as the UCs 
role, and practical skills, handled by the state and community colleges and 
universities. 

own depanment has expensive video studiO$ and cameras, editing rooms and 
recording labs, all of which teach practical production techniques. But they have no 
labs or programs for practical writing. 

Helene Keyssar, the chairwoman of the communication department, says that 
journalism is a practical form of media study that has no place in her depanment, 
which stresses the historical evolution and social Critique of a wide variety of 
communication topics. She's right. If a student wants to learn journalism, he or she 
should go to San Diego State or to any other of the campuses of the state university 
system which offer that major. UCSD's communication major is strongly based in 
the liberal arts and teaches students not how to write , but what is written about and 
why. 

What Keyssar and the university fail to see is that students will have to find work 
after graduation and a communication degree is just not enough. Possessing 
practical skills is a must in today's impacted field of communic;ation, and having 
some experience (in journalism for an example) would only help students decide if 
they want to enter the field, while exposing them to the environment that awaits 
them. The communication depanment acts as if journalism is taboo. The only rwo 
courses offered on the subject are through literature/ writing. Keyssar says it's too cut 
and dry practical, and that's not what this university is about. That's a farce . The 
biology, physics, chemistry and EE&CS depanments all ofTer !lands-on experience 
for students m lab classes that courd get them a job tomorrow. Visual ans teaches 
photography, sculpture and drawing along with its an history and theory. Keyssar's 

The communication proglam lacks courses that focus and experiment with the 
printed word , which is the basis of almost all modem communication. Can you 
Imagine a film or television show without a written script? If classes teaching' the 
techniques of journalists were offered students would discover both the process and 

r~sult of something that is. now only analyzed. 11 would supply a view from both 
Sides of the spectrum. Wnnng labs would only enhance the theoretical . 
communication education. 

We are not advocating that journalism ovenake communication, only that it 
accompany it. You can spend four years teaching a student about the media - its 
function and impact on people, its problems and origins - but what good is 
knowing all that if you can't put it to use? 

There is a strong push within the department for students to get their ' practical" 
experience on the outside with internships; local television or radio stations, public 
relations firms and newspapers, trips to Washington, D.C. and others. It's a good 
idea, combining a strong theoretical educ.ation with experience in the field , but it's 
nOl realistic. Very few of these intemships are paid and students who need to work 
or can't afford the luxury of a six year college education miss out. Many of these 
slave labor internships have students do nothing more than answer phones, shuffie 
papers and do the basic crap work. But they have to do it , the competitive field 
which communication students want to enter requires a solid resuml! and proof that 
they did more in school than analyze The Graduate and Bt'in£ There. 

Teaching theory provides a strong base that makes students think about their 
field, but sooner or later the majority have to hit solid ground, and in today's job 
market, we better hit the ground running.

Sporting Divergence 
Editor: 

When we o~n the spons 
section of the Guardian, we don't 
want to read about nation-wide 
professional spons. We can read 
abolAt pro SPOrtS in the L.A. 
TImes or San Diego Union but 
what we want to know about is 
our fellow students and their 
intercollegiate teams, most of 
which are extremely competitive 
and nationally ranked in 
Division 111. To compare these 
athletes to Division I or 
professional athletes is like 
comparing the Malibu Grand 
Prix to the Indy 500. What is the 
point? Our athletes work very 
hard to do their best in a very 
non-spons oriented school and 
to have fun doing it; not to find 
themselves bemg put down by 
their own newspaper. 

The Guardian can be an 
incredibly driving positive force 
as was pointed out by the men's 
soccer team this year. The 
Guardian helped to encourage 
the entire school to come OUt 
and support the soccer team. 
ThiS increase in support and 
crowds helped immensely in 
their performance during their 
season as well as their regional 
playoffs This force can also act 
for all the other teams as well. 
They may not have undefeated 
seasons, but m most cases you 
will fj nd that this is caused by 
their stiff competition. Many 
sports on campus have far from 
undefeated records not because 
they can't compete in division 
lIl , but because they broaden 
their horizons to compete with 
Division 11 and even Division I 
schools. 

In order for the Guardian to 
have this positive force on the 
school and the athletic program, 
the Guardian must make more of 
an effort to participate and 
support the events. By "hanging 
out" with the athletes 
occasionally \lnd coming out to 
see their matches or games, you 
will get a bener overall picture 
and be able to form your own 
opinion and not subject to the 
coaches' or players' opinion. This 
will also help alleviate the 

frequent misspellings of names 
and lack of knowledge of game 
times. 

Too many times do we read 
under a captivating picture , "A 
UC player dribbles down court" 
or "Brad Kamansky hits a free 
throw against orre Dame." 
(Does Greg Kamansky have a 
twin brother we don't know 
about?) How much effort does it 
take to simply find OUt the name 
of that athlete that puts in 12-15 
hours a week of hard work to

her team number one? In the 
men's volleyball article in your 
Jan. 16 . issue, you spelled Scon 
Hurst - Scott Kirst, Eric 
Hallman - Mark Lehrer (whom 
we've never heard of) and 
informed the public of the 
alumni match on SatUrday, Jan. 
21 when it was Tuesday, Jan. 21. 
Earlier in the same issue we read 
about the "6-0 in '85 as Women 
Revenge Loss to Whittier," and 
here we thought it was 1986. 
Worst ofT all, how many times 
have these athletes come back 
from wmning tourneys or beating 
teams that they should have lost 
to and found no mention of this 
in their own school's newspaper 
whatsoever? The least that could 
be done IS to have the results 
printed, even if the writer didn 't 
attend the game. We aren 't 
saying that we never deserve bad 
write-ups, we just think they 
could point out the goals we 
have attained in our seasons and 
nOl what we've failed to do. 

With a little more time and 
panicipation m the spons 
program, we are certain that the 
Guardian's SpOrts section could 
become a very positive and 
supporting force in UCSD 
athletics.

Divided Resources 
Editor. 

I'd like to add to the debate 
berween Kathy Beckett and 
Karen McAlpine McGill over the 
proposed renaming of the 
Women's Resource Center. Ms. 
McGill argues that since 
·women's issues" are really global 

we should have a "Human 
Resources Center" instead. This 
is like saying that since 
chemistry is derived from the 
laws of physics, there is no need 
for chemistry to exist as a 
distinct branch of science. 

I am glad to see that Ms. 
McGill recognizes rape (and 
other women's issues) as the 
social problem it is. But to say 
that since men are also affected 
by rape, or that men may fear 
their loved ones being raped, 
does not mean that rape is the 
central issue to men that it is to 
women. Yes, every social issue is 
interconnected. Yet not every 
issue is equally important to 
those it affects. ConSider Ms. 
McGill's "rapist prevention 
classes for men." As beneficial as 
such classes could be, they 
would be subject to a strong 
selection bias - e.g., potential 
rapists are not likely to attend ! 

Given limited tcsources of 
time and money, the Women's 
Center must choose its focus. 
This does not imply we are 
claiming exclusive right to any 
issues, or that we think the 
social context in which problems 
occur is unimportant. (As a 
matter of interest, during last 
November's "Model to Militant" 
rally, men were specifically 
addressed on the issue of rape . 
Yet the forum in which this took 
place was a "women 's rally" -
sponsored, organized and led by 
people dedicated to "women's 
issues." Think about it.) 

The Women's Center does not 
exclude men. There are men 
regularly visiting the present 
center, panicipating in 
discussions and helping with the 
work. Those who want to be 
here are here; they are not 
scared away by gender 
indentification. Further, we do 
not feel downtrodden and 
oppressed because we have 
identified "our" issues. If 
anything, We feel empowered -
aware that among all the needs 
that exist in our society, we can 
address one or twO and make a 
difference. Renaming the 
Women's Center would only 
diffuse its focus , thereby leading 
to confusion and inertia. 

in nature , alTectin,g both sexes, 

Finally, 1 invite Ms. McGill to 
visit the Women's Center and to 
see that it is a "human resou~ 
center" in fact (if not in name). 
JUSt as IAGO and BSU exist as 
human resource centers, each 
retaining its individual focus and 
set of priorities, the Women's 
Center would like to maintain its 
identity as a place for women. 
Ms. McGill implies that 
acknowledging the problems that 
affect one's group is tantamount 
to becoming a victim of them, At 
the Women's Center, we've 
found the oppOSite is true!

The downside of Rambonomics 
By PETER QUERClA 

Millions of Americans still 
credit Ronald Reagan and the 
Republican Administration with 
"turning the country. around," 
economically. A cursory glance of 
the surface would seem to bare 
out this grossly simplified 
statement. But a more thorough, 
objective probe into the depths 
of this great economic recovery . 
Reagan gloats so much about, 
indicates that more accurately, 
"Rambonomics" has indeed 
tumed the country around by 
planting it firmly on its head. 

Unemployment in December 
dipped to 6.9 percent, dropping 
below 7 percent for the first time 
since April 1980. The Reagan 
Administration immediately 
flicked on the applause sign and 
the accolades have continued 
ever since. No one mentions 
anymore that this tremendous 
feat was achieved by adding to 
the workforce 1.7 million 
members of the armed force~. 
Nor has there been any mention 
of the fact that the Reagan 
Administration got Congress to 
repeal the Federal Supplemental 
Compensation Program last 
March. This step alone knocked 
from the benefit rolls hundreds 
of thousands of unemployed 
Americans. When Jimmy Carter 
was president, most Americans 
would nO! tolerate a 7 percent 
unemployment rate but Reagan 
has apparently succeeded in 
convincing us not only to lower 
our standards and expectations 

but even make us feel good 
about it. 

Because of more stringent 
eligibility rules imposed on those 
who apply for unemployment 
benefits today only 61'.4 percent, 
or 5.6 million of the nation's 8:3 
million jobless persons are now 
eligible to collect unemployment 
insurance, whereas a decade ago 
under the old rules three of every 
four unemployed workers were 
able to receive compensation. 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who 
founded this insurance program 
exactly 50 years ago , must be 
spinning in his grave over thiS 
injustice. 

If these statistics weren't 
dismal enough, today an 
unprecedented 5.5 million 
Americans have had their former 
full-time jobs converted to part-
time positions. Yet another 1.2 
million reported that they had 
given up all hopes of finding 
employment. The hardcore 
unemployed consisting of the 
most unskiUed and uneducated 
have long been ignored by the 
Reagan Administration and no 
doubt will continue to be, as 
Washington .begins to dismantle 
the few remaining job training 
programs still barely functioning. 

Meanwhile, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics disclosed in 
December that the average 
American worker's annual salary 
actually plummeted by 1.1 ' 
percent in 1985, while the wages 
given high-paid corporate

of 7.3 percent last year. In 
biblical language, to those who 
have, still more WclS given. To 
those who have not, even what 
little they had was taken a~y. 

Between June and September, 
better paying manufacturing jobs 
were being lost at the rate of 
40,000 a month , as massive 
numbers of workers were forced 

t~ shift employment to the 20th 

Century version of the 19th 
Century sweatshops - the so-
called service-oriented industries, 
such as retail shops, fast food 
stands and convenience stores. 

Since Reagan took office in 
1981 he has managed to keep 
the minimum wage stuck at a 
paltry $3.35 an hour, though the 
cost of living in this same period 
has risen over 25 percent. None 
of these households were helped 
by Reagan's four-year , 25 percent 
taJ( cut. Of 4 million Americans

paid by the hour some 6 million , 
or one worker in 20, receives 
only minimum wage . Worse , the 
centerpiece of "Rambonomics" is 
legislation establishing a 
nationwide minimum wage of 
jUst $2.50 an hour under the 
pretense it would boost 
employment among teenagers, 
who Reagan believes don't 
deserve even minimum wage. 

Personal income in the third 

quarter of 1985, after adjustment 
for inflation, declined at an 
annual rate of 4.5 percent. In 
response, the money Americans 
socked away shrunk from 6 
oercent of gross income at the 
end of 1984, down to 3.7 
percent in the last quarter of 1985. 
Meanwhile consumer debt, 
apparently paralleling Reagan's 
astronomical national debt, is 
increasing at a dramatic clip as 
Americans scramble to maintain 
unrealisticaUy high lifestyles by 

financing it with anificial capital. 
Food stamps, the most 

powerful weapon used in 
Lyndon johnson's War on 
Poverty, a program which fed 
millions of impoverished 
Americans, is also being targeted 
for even further cutbacks by the 
administration. Again, because of 
stricter eligibility rules, barely half 
of those families entitled to 
stamps are now receiving them, 
often because~there is no 
convenient place to apply for 
them or state regulations are 
prohibitive. The Physicians Task 
Force on Hunger of the Harvard 
School of Public Health has 
identified 150 hunger counties 
In the United States, place where 
less than 30 percent of those 
families eligible to receive 
benefits are. getting them. Jim 
Ithurralde, assessor of Eureka 
County, Nev. the location 
identified by the researchers as 
the nation's hungriest county 
dismisses the catastrophe by 
saying precisely what the well-
heeled "Hooverites." of the Great 
Depresssion Era were so fond of 
pointing out: "I haven't see any 
people starving around here ." 

Under the Reagan 
Administration's distorted way of 
thinking, these are the best of 
times. In reauty, nowever, with 
ever-increasing frequency for 
greater numbers of American 
families, these days are proving 
to be the worst of times. ~

Bouncing with the Chiefs but they did take a long time to answer each question, since 
about half of them spoke up, 
inte!jected their own reminisces, 
added an enlightening note, 
clarified a point or engaged in 
similar conduct with most of the 
questions, resluting in a response 
·time of about 10 minutes per 
question. Of course, some of the 
questioners, especially a UCSD 
history professor and another 
person who expressed five or six 
political agendas, didn't help any 
by taking a minute and a half to 
ask their questions. However, 
many of the answers, and often 
the type of answers, expressed 
by the panicipants created a 
broad view, an imponant view, 
of what happened in different 
administrations. But stiU, they 
took sooo long sometimes. Once 
John Chancellor stepped out of 
the role of moderator to intetject 
his own observations. The 
audience slept. 

Perhaps the most interesting 
experience was standing in one 
of the lines of questioners. I had 
noticed that, despite the focus of 
the questions on the nature of 
the White House staff and chief 
of staff, no one asked any 
questions about how other 
countries do things. So I stood in 
a line, which led down to the 
holy grail, the Almighty 
Microphone . And I stood in line . 
And I stood in line. During the 
(belated) intermission, I stood in 
line. I stood because I couldn't 
find a convenient place to sit 
down and still make it perfecdy 
obvious that I was in the line. A 
UCSD student stood ahead of 

By ROBERT LEONE, Staff Writtr 
"Twenty-five Years of the 

Presidency" the ticket said , 
Through a combination of luck 
and alenness (I saw a poster and 
staned telephoning all over 
campus to get tickets) I obtained 
one of the coveted passes to the . 
afternoon session' 01 the 
symposium, the question and 
answer period . It was an 
experience 111 not soon forget . 

The crowd outside Mandell 
Weiss was very unusual. It was 
both older and younger than the 
crowd you'd get at a chamber 
music concert, and the feeling of 
raw political power was nearly 
tangible. The woman behind me 
in line was wearing the Diane 
Feinstein look in dark blue wool, 
and the woman in from of me 

was weraring the Diane Feinstein 
look in red ultrasuede. We all 
were being gratUitously 
entertained by the UCSD leftist 
rhythm and rhythm band, which 
was banging drums and shouting 
slogans which would have been 
more appropriate if shouted at 
an anti-apartheid rally. I peered 
into the press room to see if I 
could recognize anybody, but no 
one was in . When I got inside, 
the first time I've ever been in 
Mandell Weiss, I found out that 
the guy sitting next to me (in a 
pinstriped suit) was a field 
representative for BiU Lowry, the 
congressman. He took the time 
to point out ex-Governor Pat 
Brown near the front row and 
mentioned that Tom Blair had 
been by, probably lookin.it for 

names to drop. 
More or less on time, the 

panicipants came on stage , the 
stage lights brightened. and John 
Chancellor spoke and gave the 
ground rules. If you had a 
question to ask, you walked up 
to one of the micropones at 
either side of the hall and waited 
until the Chancellor asked you to 
speak. He also wanted any 
questioners to identify 
themselves before they asked 
their questions. Then the 
proceeding really began. 

I had asked a political major 
what to look for. He answered 
that I should look for the greatest 
collection of egomaniacs I've ever 
seen on stage. Well, they didn't 
interrupt each other and they 
didn't vernally assault each other; 

me and a middle-aged woman 
dressed in ultra suede (blue) 
behind me, and I stood in line 
some more. After a litde more 
than an hour in the line, I had 
to leave the theater to catch a 
bus. So I never got a chance to 
ask my question . ~

New space for engineers 
An estimated $30 million bid 

was made at a public opening of 
bids held on Jan . 9, to build a 
new EECS and AMES 
Engineering building on Warren 
campus, according to Mark 
Nelson, a project manager of 
UCSD Facilities, Design and 
Construction Office. Comractors 
from Colorado, Hensel and 
Phelps were chosen and 
completion of the project is set 
for Sept. 1987, Nelson said. 

"To finance the project we will 
sell high-tech bonds to investors 
until UCSD can buy the bonds 
back," said Nelson . "It takes three 
months to sell the bonds , so the 
contraCtors won't be able to 
begin building until then ." 

The $30 million budget 
includes the building of the 
structure as well as the 
equipment budget that will

be used in research and in 
teaching to provide a more 
current learning experience for 
the students," said Dr. Lea 
Rudee, dean of the electrical 
engineering department. 

The engineering department, 
now located in Urey Hall, will, 
with the exception of chemical 
engineering, be housed in the 
new building, Rudee said. In 
addition , the spaces vacated by 
the AMES department are to be 
replaced by the chemistry 
department, and the EECS 
depanment spaces filled by 
computer science and 
mathematics. 

Buss, Silvers, Hughs and 
Assoc. is the architectural firm 
chosen to design and fumish the 
engineering structure. Allen 

,...-- ~ 

Tumer, spokesperson for the 
.firm , described the physical 
characteristics of the eight-story 
hUilding as "gradual." 

"The structure progressivley 
becomes narrower as you reach 
the top and this is done so that 
the building may fit in with the 
natural surroundings," Turner 
said . The same strategy was pan 
of the design of Central Library, 
he said . 

The bUilding is divided into 
three different pans, according 
to Turner: the offices of the

Communications vs. Journalism 

Exploring the major controversy 
By DAWN WATTS, St4 W'l1kr 

SHOUlD UCSD OFFER A joumaUsm program? This question may not be one 
that has been the center of 
heated debate or one that has 
even been considered at any 
length by UCSO's curriculum 
planners. 

Chairperson for the 
communication department, 
Helene Keyssar, repbes, "Why 
should it {UCSO) have a 
journalism 'departmem? There 
are many different kinds of 
departments the university could 
have that it does not have." She 
explains, "Journalism in this 
country has prtmarily been 
taught as a profeSSion, at 
professional graduate schools." 
Keyssar points OUt that UCSO 
has focused on research and on 
theory and not on the 
development· of professional 
schools. 

(student-run radio station on 
campus.) She stated , "It's very 
hard to tell what the person is 
learning and doing, so that the 
degree of control thal's there in 
having something like an 
internship, where people are 
reflecting and working with an 
adviser both on the job and WIth 
the department, seems 'the better 
way to go" 

It may be that many students 
who are now in the 
communication program would 
prefer to major or minor In 
Journalism if UCSO offered such 
a program. Alison Marosek a 
sentor majonng in 
communication, says that if 

. level," he says that is not the 
issue when it come to whether 
or not journalism is offered as an 
undergraduate program. "The 
mandate given to the University 
of California was to concern 
itself primarily with graduate and 
research educauon." 

Keyssar went on to explain 
that the type of education a 
student of communication will 
receive at UCSO is one that 
should make them more aware of 
the media and knowledgeable to 
how the systems of 
communication work and not 
provide training. "Our whole 
thrust has been to combine 
practice, theory and history, but . 
not with the primary aim being 
to train people for a particular 
skill or profession .. 

UCSD offered a journalism 
program she wold be intersted "if 
not in the major, definitely the 
minor." Though Alison is 
interested in journalism, she says 
"I don't feel like I have any 
training and that's why I'm not 
going into it (journalism)." Alison 
has taken the Comm/ Cul 
newswriting workshop which she 
felt was "really helpful," but adds, . 
"I Wish they would have more 
classes like that." She also says 
she would take a news writing 
production class if she could get 
credit for it. 

This mandate, the Master Plan 
for Higher Education in 
Cahfornia. has set lirnltations 
upon the California State 
University, the University of 
Cahfornia, as well as the 
community coUeges. Within this 
plan It is stated: "The Cahfornia 
State University and Colleges are 
to offer undergraduate education 
and a variety of advanced 
training through the master's 
degree. The University of 
California also provides 
undergraduate instruction and 
has exclusive jurisdiction over 
the doctorate, certain types of 
professional training and most 
researc h." The Master Plan states 
that the reason for assigning 
specific roles to each system was 
to "regulate competition among 
institutions trying to achieve 
comprehensive collegiate or 
university status. Such 
competiiion ... would have 
resulted in duplication of effort." 

Robert Dorn,freelance writer and correspondent for the SanJose Mercury and 
the New York Times: "there is not even the beginning of a commilment to fund 
a jounalism department (a t UCSD)." 

However, Keyssar says that the 
department does ofTer some 
courses that combmC' theory and 
practice Courses that fo us on 
news analYSIS and the news 
wmlng workshop course are 
deSigned "to provide the 
pOSSIbility of students 
understanding a medIum 
through the process of engaging 
In tt. . through practice ." 
Students get thls expenence or 
practice when they do projects 
In the communJcauon classes 
that may Involve working WIth 
computers, video or theater 
producllon. 

Though Keyssar says that the 
department has encouraged 
students to put out a newspaper, 
hke a communication 
newspaper, she does not beheve 
that students should recetve 
credit for workmg on one of the 
campus newspapers or for KSOT 

Though some communication 
students may be interested in 
Journalism, it does not appear 
that any number of them transfer 

Griffin differentiates between 
UCSO's instruction and SDSU 's: 
"Those programs (at SDSU) are 
deSIgned to give applied 

we're mostly interested in and 
not job preparation." 

A VIsit to SOSU's.departmem 
of journalism in the College of 
Professioal studies revealed to me 
a highly populated shcool with a 
vast amount of resources for 
students interested not only in 

* 

"Our (the communication department) whole thrust has 
been to combine practice, theory and history, b~t not wi~h the 
primary aim being to train people for a partrcular skrll 
or profeSSion. " -Keyssar 

to another university, such as 
San Olego State University, 
which offers a degree In . 
Journahsm Program 
representative and student 
adviser of communication, Greg 
Gnffln, comments, "I don't know 
of a speCIfic Sllua!lon where a 
student left UCSO to go to San 
Olego State UniversIty to pursue 
Journalism." 

Although Griffin feels that 
Journa1tsm IS "worthy of being 
taught at the undergraduate 

educatlon in the particular 
field they approach the 
subject matter In a way that does 
nO! question the why's and 
wherefore's of the media, which 
IS what our communication 
program does." Griffin explall1s 
that UCSO's approach IS 
different because it deals \Vlth 
theoretical approaches to 
communication. "We expect our 
students to analyze , cnttque, and 
CritiCize the media ," says Gnffin 
He adds, "BaSically a's educatIon 

journahsm, but also 
photojournalism, 
telecommunications, speech 
communicatlon and public 
relaIJons. 

An aSSOCiate professor of 
Journalism as 50S , Barbara 
Hartung explained theIr program 
while she took me on a tour of 
the College of Profess tonal 
Studies. "There are three 
departments whIch are closely 
related with the college; . 
telecommmumcattons and film, 
speech communi canon and 
journalism." 

As a result o( hundreds of 
students flooding Into SDSU 's 
Journalism program and the 
comparatively small faculty, 
many studentS are not aote to get 
into lasses. "Last semeste r 250 
students did not get into classes 
that they wanted .. 120 students 
who pre-registered for the 
begmnmg newswriting class 
didn 't get It ," saId Hartung. 

In addition , Hartung said that 
the Journalism program "hands 
out the lowest grades." B- is the 
average GPA for journalism 
students at SDSU. "We're playing 
tough ... holding aga inst grade 
inflatiol"!. very well," Hartung. 
remarked . "We want students to 
succeed but we have high 
standards ." 

Although SDSU does not offer 
a maste rs degree tn JOU rna Ii sm 
they do have" program for a

Hartund also spoke of the 

Educational Plan for the state of 
California. She mentioned the 
journalism programs at UCLA 
and UC Berkeley, which have 
both diminished. 'Journalism has 
not fared well in the UC system. 
It's not considered a legitimate 
study," she said. 

When 1 walked into the 
producnon room of The Dally 
Aztec I encountered at least 20 
people bUZZing around a room 
full of tables. desks and paper. A 
cIrcular table whIch held about a 
dozen computers, all of which 
were occupIed by wraers, was at 
the center of the room. A few 
typewriters could be found on . 
smaU desks around the room. 

Ann SWIft, one of {WO city 
editors, works an average of six 
hours a day at The Dally Aztec 
"It's more work than 1 ever 
dreamed of ... it's hke a second 
Job," Ann said. She told me that 
she transferred to SDSU from 
UCLA because they didn't have a 
major tn Journalism. She had 
been a writer at The DCllly Aztec 
Jor one semester before moving 
up to the city editor position . 
''I've learned m'ore here (at the 
Aztec) than In one semester of 
class," she said. 

Ann plans to go to New York 
as she has connections there 
from professors at SOSU . "We've 
got some reaUy good faculty 
here ," she said, but added. 
"professors hate it.. . students 

. working on The Aztec, because it 
takes up 50 much of our time." 

AccounJ execunve for Thr 
Dally Aztec . Tracy Daly, came to 
work for their newspaper after 
working full ume as a sports 
wmer for Coast Dispatch . At 
SDSU Tracy is working on 
getting his teaching credentials 
In English/Journali sm. "I worked 
as a reponer for one year and as 
dty edItor for a year. and then 
decided 1 wanted to do

really Impressed by The Dwly

newspaper. He commented on 
the journalism classes being 
taught as "enjoyable" and "good 
leaming experience," but said he 
would never major in journalism. 
He feels that a degree in 
journalism will only help those 
who want to break into the 
major dailies. "Then you have to 
have the degree ... they like to 
sec it," he said. Tracy said that 
TfIt Daily Aztec is "not too

freelance writer and stringer 

for Tht Ntw Yom Timts and the 
San Jose Mercury Ntws, Robert 
Oorn talks about job possibilities 
for students graduating from 
SDSU and srudents graduating 
from UCSO: "If you wanted to 
stay in San Diego and be a print 
journalist, SOSU might be the 
better place to be. If you wanted 
to leave San Diego to be a pnnt 
journalist, SDSU's reputation, 
generally, as a university, 
wouldn't be as prestigious as 
UCSD's." Dorn adds, "Neither 
school "really has a rigorous, news 
oriented, journalism oriented 
program." 

Dorn who has been teaching 
basic jo~rnalism classes through 
the literature/ writing department 
at UCSO, feels that courses in 
newspaper production focused 

on publishing a sludent 
newspaper would be. the most 
life-like way o~ runnmg a 
program. "It's really rtecessary 
among beginning or aspinng 
journalists to test theory, to test 
instruction," says Oorn. 

Last february Oorn made a 
proposal to the InstruCtional 
Improvement Advisoty 
Committee for funds to set up a 
production lab for the journalism 
class he teaches. His idea was to 
get a big room with lots of 
typewriters, a few phones and 
desks, and "try to cover hard 
news." And then, to publish in 
the Guardian. Dorn asks, "Can 
you imagine if you had a real 
campus newspaper that was 
involved with the decisions that 
affect students' Lives? It would be 

great'" 
This proposal was for funding 

in the 1985/ 1986 school year. 
Dorn never received a reply from 
the committee. "It fell like a 
piece of lead. It got nowhere .. . 
there is not even the beginning 
of a commitment to fund a 
journalism department." 

Dorn feels that he is limited to 
teaching just fundamental, basic 
expression under the conditions 
of a small classroom and no 
equipment. Dom explains, "If the 
school is going to do it, they 
have to devote a lot more money 
to a humanities/ professional 
curriculum, than it's willing to." 

Dorn also thinks a hybrid 
program, established within the 
writing program or with the 
communications department, is 

FEATURES 
something that could be done to 
promote a practical writing 
program. 

His idea is to have a multi-
diSCiplinary program which 
would involve subjects like 
political science, economics, 
history and English. "Maybe we 
wouldn't be preparing people to 
run out and be correspondents 
right away, but you might 
prepare them for employment .. . 
might give them a broad 
education, also a direction. a 
general direction towards being a 
newsperson," he explains. "It's 
altogether possible if the school 
is interested. Certainly the 
students are interested. So far as 
I can tell, there is no interest in 
the communications department 
in print journalism." ~

·Men drop to 8-10 in 
front" of nearly no one 
By MA IT IAlT Staff Wnter 

I NA GAME WHERE there were about as many UCSD fans as KSDT listeners, 
the Tritons, added another 
defeat to their now 8-10 record 
by losing to the Cal Baptist 
Lancers 84-67 Monday night. 

In the first half, UCSD was 
"taken out of the game early," 
according to Lancers coach Jerry 
King, "Our defense, especiaUy 
our zone hurt them." 

Marshall agreed with King's 
assessment. "He's right. They 
came out with a 1-3-1 zone. We 
didn't practice for it and we 
couldn't adjust for it until 
halftime." 

The TrilOns were down by as 
many as 14 points in the firs~ 
half. "We came out and were flat 
tonight," said junior guard Jim 
Smith. At half, UCSD went into 
the locker room 11 points 
behind , 38-27, 

"They adjusted weU 10 our 
defenses in the second haIL" 
said coach King. Marshall felt 

• that the changes they made 
during halftime "accounted for 
their comeback attempt in the 
second half" 

The T rilOns .... 'Cre able 10 cut 
the Lancer lead to four pOintS 
with 15:44 left in the game. The 
run for the lead was sparked by 
Brian Backens who had 14 
points for the niEht, Thor Dekker 
who came off the bench to chip 
in 12 points and Greg 
Kamansky who led the Tritons 

with 16 points. 
Kamansky, this week's Player 

of the Week, has caught fire as 
of late . In last week's loss 10 
Christ College, the 6'Y junior 
guard set a school record scoring 
40 pOintS. 

The comeback that UCSD 
made was short-lived, for in a 
matter of minutes they were back 
down by 9. Marshall substituted 
all but one player from the 
bench. Tritons came in and out 

01 the game constantly. He tried 
many combinations but none of 
the groupings seemed to 
perform. The lancers won easily, 
84-67. 

One player who did come off 
the bench to perform well was 
senior transfer Thor Dekker. 
"Thor will be seeing more 
playing time," said Marshal after 
Dekker's Monday night 
performance. 

Another palyer who received 
some respect, at least form 
Lancer's center Anthony Davis, 
was Mark Sutherlin. "He is just a 
freshman now, but he is going to 
be real lOugh in the future. He's 
a ballplayer," said Davis, "He's 
just like the rest of their team, 
young. They're not a bad team, 
JUSt inexperienced. On any given 
night aybody can beat anybody; 
this was our given night. But I 
knew we were going to beat 
them, we have the better club." 

"Their weakness lies in the 
fact that they're a young team," 
coach King also said, 'They're a 
good team but it takes time to 
play at the college leveL" 

"It's true ," said Marshall, "the 
botlOm line is that we're a young 
team, and we still make crucial 
mistakes. I brought seven 
freshmen into the program this 
year and have no regrets about 
It. I'm glad I did it this way. I 
consider four of the seven 'blue-
chip players: unfortunately two 
of the four are gone; one, Alfie 
Basile, with an injury, and the 
other, Crai~ Allen, left schooL 

"Now all we can do is go 
back to the fundamentals. We'll 
learn, but in the meantime the 
losses are lOugh to take. It gets 
old real fast" 

The Tritons go on the road 
next to play laVerne and CSU 
San Bernardino. The next home 
game is against Westmont on 
Feb. 1 at 8:00. ~ 

Linksters prepared to 
better '85 finish 
By DAVID TEDROW, Staff Wnter 

T HIS YEAR'S version of the UCSD men's inter-collegiate golf team 
begins its season this week on 
the Eisenhower course at 
Industry Hills. They will be 
among the 14 schools playing in 
the 54-hole BiD Bryant 
Invitational Tournament against 
teams from such schools as San 
Diego State, Cal State Long 
Beach, Texas EI Paso, 
Washington and defending 
champion UCLA This is the first 
SlOp on the road which may take 
them to the national 
championships this spring in 
Wilks-Barre, Pennsylvania. They 
were able to successfully follow 
this road last year, finishing 
second in the Division 1\1 
national tournament to conclude 
a very successful season. 

Leading this year's team wiD 
be junior Pat. Weishan who 1S 
coming off a very good 1985 
campaign. In addition 10 
finishing second in the 
individual competition of last 
year's championships, this All· 
American is also the defending 
City Amateur Champion of San 
Diego. This tournament is open 
to all amateur golfers, not simply 

those playing for college teams. 
Another returning starter for 

the TrilOn's is Kevin "Buddy" 
Lea. This senior EECS major is 
the tanest member of the team, 
and was an honorable mention 
All-American last year. The 
remaining returner from last 
year's squad is Mike O'Laughlin. 
Another senior EECS major, 
O'laughlin is the team captain 
again this year. 

The rest of this year's team 
will be made up of newcomers 
including freshmen Brad Sterling 
and JOOSt Steenkamer, a 
Dutchman at San Diego by way 
of Hong Kong. Others expecting 
to compete for starting positions 
include Barry Bariteau and 
William "Fritz" Reber, a transfer 
student from USC 

Mike Wydra feels that the 
team could do better than last . 
year and that the team has · 
improved, "Pat and Kevin have 
improved from last year in which 
they were both already good , but 
we may not be as deep as we 
were last year." With a season's 
expenence under their belts 
however, thiS team should be 
one of the favorites when 
nationals come around. 1m

Racquetball 
Tournament 
Starts Jan. 31 

T HE FIRST ANNUAL UCSD Racquetball Club A11-Campus Tournament will 
take place Jan. 31 at 6 pm and 
Feb. 1 at 9 am. The event, the 
first of its kind on thiS large of a 
scale, is sponsored by the 
Racquetball Club. 

Inspired by gaining interest in 
the SpOrt, contributable to the 
building of the Canyonview 
Recreation Center, the club has 
been very active this year. Laurel 
Dean, Recreation Club adviser, 
believes this is the best year ever 
for the club. ·Since the courts 

were built, membership has hit 
an all·time high. It think the 
added facility has made · a lot of 
people happy." 

With the five new courts, the 
Racquetball Club has been able 
to hold weekly meetings. Held 
Mondays, 8-11 pm at 
Canyonview, the meetings give 
members a chance to work out 
on a regular basis. All levels of 
players work together to improve 
their games. 

'They get pretty competitive ," 
~ys Dean, "especially when it 
comes to challenge matches." 

The tournament will be a good 
chance for all of UCSD to 
become involved in this growing

Continued from page 10 
the waist up, sabre fencing can 
get preny adventurous. "Sabre 
fencers rely on reflex more than 
foil fencers," according to Greg 
Chow, sabre captain. which 
makes sabre fencing resemble 
the swashbuckling seen in the 
movies. 

Despite shallow rivalries over 
weapons, the UCSD team has a 
sense of camaraderie. Jones feels 
she has "16 older brothers" 
adding that "they don't hold me 
back because I'm a girl ... \'.'C're 
a team but we joke around a lot 
too." The women's team feels 
especially close since three of the

Fencing has retained some 
aristocratic mannerisms, such as 
saluting one's opponent before 
and after a bout. Yet. wi th the 
advent of modern equipment,' 
mass-manufactured outfits and 
electronic scoring, fencing has 
truly become a 20th century 
sport. It is time that fencing was 

" much of fencing strategy used today 
has been the passed down advice of the 
sutvivo~ of fendng duels." 
the rate UCSD is going, they may 
get some top awards as well as a 
chance at the Nationals. 

Once an integral part of 
society and a form of defense, 
fencing is no longer a Iife-and-
death sport. However, much of 
fencing strategy used today has 
been passed down advice of the 

seen as a sport like other 
popular spons; its associations 
with a romantic past are 
interesting, but irrelevant today.

computer does with a quill

Eerie and Absurd 
The UCSD drama deparrment is producing two one~act plays by 

Edward Bond and Samuel Beckett. Red, Black and Ignorant, from Bond's 
War Plays, and Beckett's Theatre II are being staged in the Studio Theatre, 
building 409, Warren Campus (the Warren Cafeteria). The two plays 
opened last night and will continue through Saturday, runningJan. 22~25, 
at 8 pm each evening. Admission is $3, with tickets available at the 
Mandell Weiss center and at the university box office. Advance purchase 
is recommended. Seats will be available at the door, but the drama 
department advises that there shall be no seating after curtain time. 

Both works address the problem of life in a nuclear world. Following 
the performances of the two plays, a discussion is to be held involving the 
audience, actors, director and a guest speaker. 

Theatre 11, directed by graduate Student Beth Schachter, is billed as "a 
sparse and abstract drama that presents the eerie and absurd situation 
which can arise when the bureaucratic process gets out of control." Peter 
Brown and Shishir Kurup, Characters A and B, government employees, 
discuss Character C, Roger Nelson. They try to decide whether he should 
jump out the window. Samuel Beckett, well known for his modern 
classics Waiting for Gx10t and Endgame, here has created more of his 
"tantalizingly abstract yet recognizable characters." 

During intermission between the plays, theatre~oers move to the 
adjacent dance studio to view a short film while the seating and staging 
areas are rearranged for the evening's second presentation. 

Red, Bla.:k and Ignorant, part one of Edward Bond's War Pia,s trilogy, is 
directed by graduate student Ralph Janes, and features Carolyn Sweeney 
as Women, Giovanni Felicioni as Men and Deryl Caitlyn as Monster . 
Working as an ensemble, these three players present a variety of 
characters in Bond's frightening depiction of nuclear society. A political 
playwright in England, Edward Bond has had a number of his works 
produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre and 
Barbicon Center. 

The productions this week, and their post~performance discussions, 
are an opportunity for UCSD students to consider what it means to live 
under the threatening nuclear umbrella that has covered us since 1945 and 
to reflect on how this political and social reality has been instrumental in 
inspiring (if such a thing is possible - that the bomb could inspire) two 
modern writers. This Hiatus writer anticipates that the intimacy of the 
Studio Theatre may contribute to an understanding of how close our 
species is to self~annihilation, the destruction of our society, and the end, 
perhaps, of all life on Earth.

Cartoons have never really 
been made for children. Nor 
have they been made for 
adults. More than anything, 
cartoons, on a certain level, 
have been made strictly for 
the enjoyment of their 
creators. The Festival of 
Animation that is currently at 
the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art shows that 
in a world where production 
standards have declined and 
cartoons have become little 
more than vehicles for the 
marketing of sundry toy 
items, there remain artists 
dedicated to creating quality 
animated films. 

It would be presumptuous, 
erroneous and in some cases, 
even insulting, to refer to the 
films in this year's festival as 
cartoons. Clearly, by some 
standards they are. However, 
there are so many different 
types of animation being 
presented with so many 
different motives that it 
becomes obvious that no label 
may be applied. A quick 
glance at a festival program, 
available from two oddly 
dressed gentlemen on Revelle 
Plaza known only as Mike and 
Spike, will show the variety of 
these films. There are pieces 
from established animators 
such as Bob Clampett (Beanie 
and Cecil, Bugs Bunny et al), 
Paul . Driessen (The Yellow 
Submarine) and Will Vinton 
(his c1aymation for the video 
of John Foggerty's Van~ Kant 
Dant will be shown) as well as 
numerous foreign works , 
examples of computer 
animation and films created 
by students at Cal Arts. 

For adults only common variable in each of the successful films in mis year's festival. Of course, to every rule there is an 
exception, or two, or perhaps 
even three. Canadian 
animator Jacques DrOUin, 
uses a pointilist technique (he 
actually uses thousands of 
pins) to create each frame in 
his film Mindscape. Will 
Vinton's c1aymation on Van~ 
Kant Dant creates a surreal 
humanism in a greedy pig 
which must be seen to be 
appreciated. Broken Down 
Film from the Japanese 
animator Osamo Tezuka, is 
intentionally made very bad 
and because of this, it is 
extremely good. 

Charade by John Minnis is 
perhaps the best film in the 
entire series. Coincidentally, 
Charade is the cu rrent 
Academy Award Winner for 
-:I~~;:;:;;~a -animation. 
• The Festival of Animation 

More than simply cartoons, this Festival of Animation wants:you 

Oddly enough, the films animated films, High Fidelity 
that rely less on incredibly and The Adtlentures of Andre 
lavish animation and more on and Wall, B., produced by 
characters and story line are Roberty Abel and Lucasfilm 
the best. The computer respectively, show what 

incredible things computers 
can do for animation, but each

Beat crazy 
by sue peters 

Good news for the on 
campus crowd! Starting this 
quarter, there will also be 
Saturday night entertainment 
at the Pub. In addition to the 
regular Friday night Pub gigs 
there will be as many as six to 
eight shows on Saturdays. 
What kind of shows and 
music can be expected? 
According to Ray Chinn at 
the Student Center who is 
working in a combined effort 
with the University Events 
Office and Associated 
Students to improve the on~ 
campus entertainment, while 
Friday shows feature "good 
bar bands, tt Saturday nights 
will be more like concerts, 
featuring as many as three 
bands a night. 

Heading the bill will be a 
group which has at least .one 
album out (whatever that 
might amount to). Then the 
plan is for there to be two 
local support bands as well. 
This could be a great 
opportunity for bands that 
ha ven 't yet had much 
exposure, a service which up 
until now has been mostly 
provided by the Ch~Cafe and 
its regular nocturnal concerts. 

All of this will naturally 
require a more elaborate 
"stllett in the Pub . There are 
plans to elaborate on the 
lighting, to put in a P A system 
and to enlarge and poulbly 
relocate the stage to a more 
advantageous poIition. . 

And now for the bad news: 
this may necessarily lead to 

the charging of admission. 
Boo! Hiss! However, this may 
be as little as $4 for as many as 
four bands. 

And so what brought all 
this on? Apparently, there 
were numerous complaints 
from students that campus life 
was far too peaceful during 
the weekend and too 
conducive to studying. (Can't 
have that, now, can we?) And 
such claims aren't entirely 
unfounded . What's more, 
this new idea would put the 
Triton to better use. Who 
knows - even commuting 
students might be tempted to 
return to the campus on the 
weekend. (!) 

Meanwhile, UEO also has 
some interesting plans for 
concerts in the gym, at the Pub 
and rna ybe even in 
Mandeville. All proposals 
concerning student enter~ 
tainment are currently being 
deliberated at the committee 
board meetings. If approved, 
and if all goes well as far as 
booking bands is concerned, 
we will be able to look 
forward to performances 
from the likes of: 
. In February, The Bobs, an a 

cappella group from San 
Francisco; the Dynatones; 
The Dream Syndicate; in a 
psychedelia revival niKht, 
together on one bill, The 
Pandoras, The Thinp and 
possibly San Diego's own Tell 
Tale Hearts, as well as The 
Untold Fable; Preston Smith 

Saturda, in the Pub : the Fetchin Bones 

and the Crocodiles, from 
L.A.; on the gym steps, 
Fetchin Bones from North 
Carolina; and in the gym, 
Micle Jones' (ex-Clash) Big 
Audio Dvnamite. 

Plans for March include 
The Red Hot Chili Peppers 
and Fishbone (possibly aloDi 
with Tupelo Chain Sex) at the 
gym; and the Jesus and Mary 
Chain will be back out here on 
tour that month . 

From April to the end of 
the school year we could be 
seeing the Meat Pu~ts, and 
the Chameleons would like to 
tour the college circuit in the 
United States. Also, from 
England: ABC and The Art of 
Noise; Modem English will be 
touring; The Violent Femmes; 
Colour Field; the Cocteau 
Twins with special guest Dis 
Jud, hopefully in the 
Mandeville Center; allO 
touring will be Dead Can 

Dance and ColourBox; and 
maybe even Echo and the 
Bunnymen. 

So with Friday night Pub 
Kigs and T.G.s, along with 
Saturday concerts and the 
performances in the gym, it 
looks like the campus scene 
will be a bit more lively. Now, . 
what we really need is our own 
Backdoor, and then maybe a 
nice little outdoor, 5000-eeat 
amphitheatre ...

Run, man, run 
bV robert leone 

Akiru Kurosawa's Ran 
ranks as a very good film. It 
might even rank as a great 
film, if time, fate and the box 
office are kind. But don't eat 
before watching it. 

It's tough to decide who did 
a better job: the actors, the 
production crew or the 
scriptwriters (Kurosawa, 
Hideo Oguni and Masato 
Ido). Photographically, the 
film is excellent. Acting, even 
in the bit roles, is fine -
sornetimes outstanding. And 
both the production crew and 
the actors have an excellent 
script and plot to work from. 
The film is described as a 
Japanese "Lear," but this 
description does not do 
justice to the film or the play. 
The themes are the same, yet 
different. When something 
like "Lear" is presented in 
another culture, it changes -
subtly'and grossly. It would be 
more correct to say that 
Shakespeare's ttLear" forms a 
rnodel for the film, but not a 

l mold. l' The beginning of Ran is 
u sirnple . Hidetora, after 

~ spending most of his'70 years 
cs fighting, wants to retire in 
£peace. He divides his kingdom 

~ into three parts and offers it to 
if his three sons. Saburo, the 

youngest, says it's a crazy idea. 
Tango, a loyal adviser, agrees 
with Saburo publicly, and the 
two are banished. Hidetora is 
hurniliated by his older sons, 
and is sent to the castle where 
his third son once lived 
(incidently, the abandonment 
of that castle by Saburo's 
troups is a great insulting 
rendition of ttWe were just 
leaving.") The older sons 
storm the castle with their 
troops, intending to destroy 
their father. They manage to 
kill almost every other 

member of his retinue in a 
bloody assault, but the old 
man, rendered so impotent 
that he cannot find a sword to 
cornrnit suicide with, walks 
away. 

During the battle, Jiro, the 
second oldest son, has Taro, 
the oldest, killed. Jiro then 
takes over the rnain castle -
and Taro's wife, Lady Kaede. 
Jiro thinks that he can 
dorninate Kaede, but he soon 
discovers that he's mistaken. 
Kaede wants Jiro's wife, Su-e, 
killed, but the adviser 
appointed to the deed refuses. 

Meanwhile, a mad Hidetora 
is being taken care of by his 
court fool. Sab'uro returns 
with an army to recover his 
father, while Jiro tries to 
destroy Saburo's army in a 
battle that reminds one of old 
westerns. Just about 
everybody dies by the tirne the 
movie ends. 

The acting in the film is 
incredibly good. Tatsuya 
Nakadai as Hidetora (the aged 
Great Lord) presents a man 
simultaneously strong and 
feeble. His portrayal of 
madness is striking. Akira 
Tarao, Jinpachi Nezu and 
Daisuke R yu as the three 
brothers Taro, Jiro and 
Saburo rnake their roles 
believable; however, Nezu 
makes Jiro a more complete 
character. In part because he 
has rnore time on screen. 
Peter, a popular transvestite 
entertainer in Japan plays the 
role of the fool strongly. 
Mieko Harada plays Lady 
Kaede with the intensity of a 
Canyonview floodlight. 

Considering everything, 
Ran is a very good film, one 
that is worth seeing. However, 
it does have an ttR" rating for 
a reason. Don't see it after 
eating - please.
