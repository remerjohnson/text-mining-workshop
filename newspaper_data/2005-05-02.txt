Government awards 
Berkeley contract to UC 
University submitted only bid 
for management of civilian lab 

By LISA MAK 
Associate News Editor 

The U.S. Deparonent of Energy 
has awarded a new $2 .3 billion con-
tract to the University of California 
to manage Lawrence Berkeley 

ational Laboratory, extending the 
university's 70-year management of 
the lab. The contract was granted 
under the first competitive bidding 
process for management rights 
since the lab's founding in 193 I . 

"I am very pleased that the 
Department of Energy has chosen 
the University of California to con-
tinue our proud tradition of man-
aging Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory," UC President Robert 
C. Dynes stated in an April 19 
press release. "Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory is an excellent exam-
ple of the successful interaction 
between universities and the feder-
al government in managing a scien-
tific re earch facillty and producing 
results of national significance." 

The university has man-
aged the lab since its inception, 
and also manages Los Alamos 
National Laboratory and Lawrence 
Livermore Laboratory. Among the 

three labs, Berkeley is the only lab 
that does not conduct classified 
nuclea r resea rch . Congressional 
legislation passed in 2003 man-
dated that the management and 
operati ng contracts for the labs 
be put up for competitive bidding. 
The university was the only bidder 
for the Berkeley faci lity. 

"The niversity of California 
was the sole bidder for the 
Lawrence Berkeley' ational Lab, 
and so it wasn't a surprise that 
they won," said Marylia Kelley, 
executive director of the Tri-Valley 
Communities Against a Radioactive 
Environment, a nonprofit watch-
dog group for the labs. "The 
[Berkeley lab] does no classi fi ed 
weapons work, and therefore the 
University of California may well 
be the appropriate manager." 

The lab specializes in areas such 
as life sciences, computing technol-
ogie and cosmology. Researchers 
from the lab have won 10 Nobel 
Prize and 12 National Medals of 
Science. 

"From the start of the process, 
we have felt that, based on our

Frye announces mayoral run 
at assault awareness rally 

By KATE McELHINNEY 
Staff Writer 

Giving the keynote speech 
before more than 400 students 
and faculty gathered in Price 
Center for the annual "Take Back 
the Night" event, San Diego 
City Councilwoman Donna Frye 
announced her intentions to run 
in the probable special mayoral 
election later this year. 

' Speaking at the annuli I celebra-
tion designed to show support for 
victims of sexual assault, ra pe and 
domestic violence, Frye shared 
details of her own life, talking 
about a previous abusive marriage 
and her experience a a 16-yea r-
old rape victim. 

"If my coming out here can 
come through to one person, it 
give me t.he courage to talk to 
someone," Frye said . 

After announcing her intent 
to run to replace resigning San 
Diego Mayor Dick Murphy, Frye 
ended her talk by yelling, "Take 
back the rught, but help me take 
back the city!" 

Coordinated by the A.S. 
Women's Commission, the eve-
rung is designed to raise public 
awareness of the issues faced by 
victims of sexual assault, rape and 
domestic violence. In addition to 

Billy Wong/Cuardian 
Night vision: Sharing her sexual assault experience, San Diego City Councilwoman 
Donna Frye announced she win compete in the like~ special mayoral election. 
Frye, the night included other 
guest speakers, student testimoni -
als and a candlelight vigil , along 
with musical perfornlances. 

"I've never seen anything like 
this on this campus," commission 
president Nandini Pillai said. "This 
is one of the few events that brings 
all aspects of the campus together." 

Working with such organiza-
tions as the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual 
and Transgender Resource Centers 
and leaders of G reek organiza-

tions, the commis ion encouraged 
students from groups all over cam-
pus to attend , particularly men 
from the fraternity community. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Johnny Pierce heeded the commit-
tee's call, along with other members 
of the Sigma Nu fraternity. 

" I was impressed with how 
many people there were, espe-
cially guys," Pierce said. "[t's good

Sun God beer garden plan rejected 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

Staff Writer 

After receiving recommenda-
tions from the A.S. Counci l and 
other campus administrators in 
favor of the creation of a beer ga r-
den at this year's Sun God festival, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
J oseph W. Watson has decided 
against the idea, calling for more 
safety effor ts during the festival. 

Watson also rejected the 
University Events Office's rec-
ommendation to commit to the 
approva l of a beer ga rden for next 
year. 

"We were under the impression 
that if we applied ourselves toward 
safety concerns, we would be able 
to have a beer garden," said for-
mer A.S. PresidentJenn Pae, who 
lobbied Watson to approve the 
plan . "To have the idea be rejected 
was very sad." 

Watson, however, said he felt 
a beer garden would only worsen 
an already strong theme of alcohol 
during Sun God. . 

"I'm not opposed to a beer 
garden, and we have no objections 
to it," he said. "Sun God is a very 
di tinctive and special event. But 
everyone, even A .. member , has 
acknowledged that there is already 
a lot of drinking during Sun God. 

beer garden hould be done 
afely and only when it doesn't 

contribute to an atmo phere that 

emphasizes the drinking of alco-
hol and risky behavior." 

Pae said her plan would have 
curbed alcohol abuse during the 
festival by offering a controlled 
environment for consumption. 
The proposed garden esta blished 
a limit on drinks per person, an 
identification system, l 8 private 
security guards, two UC D police 
officers and a fenced area on 
RIMAC field . T he A.S. Council 's 
recommendation to operate the 
beer garden at night would have 
alleviated binge drinking during 
the day, according to Pae. 

"Because students don't have a 
venue during the evening for alco-
hol, they try to have as much alco-
hol as possible for a lasting effect 
during our night concert," she said. 
"If we had a beer garden at night, 
students could enjoy alcohol, but in 

a more responsible manner." 
Though it withheld its sup-

POrt from the plan, CSD Police 
Department expressed an under-
standing of "the desire of event 
ponsors or ven ues to serve alco-

hol to re ponsible adults," the 
department tated in its recom-
mendation to Watson . 

"Although we do not 'encour-
age' or 'endorse' beer gardens, we 
feel there would be events better 
suited to their successful ' piloting' 
than the Sun God fe tiva l," the 
statement said. . 

UEO also advised against a beer 
garden during this year's festival. 
Precautions for alcohol use need to 
be fully applled before operation of 
beer gardens, the office stated in its 
recommendation.

Lab: Final decision for Los 
Alamos expected in summer 

continued from page I 
distinguished history of partner-
ship and our impressive record of 
success, continuing management 
by the university was essential to 
maintaining the strength and qual-
ity of both institutions," Berkeley 
lab Director Steven Chu stated in 
a press release. "The announce-
ment to extend that partnership 
promises more mutual rewards, 
and further advances in scientific 
exploration in the future." 

The new contract will go into 
effect on June 1,2005, and will 
last until May 31,2010, with the 
possibility of a 15 -year extension 
if the university and the labora-
tory exhibit good performance. 
According to lab spokesman Ron 
Kold, performance standards will 
include the assessment of scientif-
ic programs, financial operations 
and safety \~ol ations. 

"It's hoped that we won't have 
to compete for another manage-
mcnt contract if we have outstand-
ing performance," Kold said. 

The new contract contains sev-
eral changes, including a different 
fee allocation structure, accord-
ing to Kold. It also establishes 
an external advisory board to 
assess busi ness practices, accord-
ing to UC spokesman Chris 
Harrington. 

However, the contract will 
include the same pensions and 
benefits for UC lab employees, 
Kold said . The employee pen-
sions and benefits system is a 
major sticking point in the request 
for the Los Alamos bids. 

"T here are a lot of initiatives 
we're pursuing in science and 
operations, but there aren't any 
dramatic changes to the employ-
ees' benefits," he said. 

Although Kelley feels that pro-
vi ion of the contract are general-
ly positive, shc said she would also 
like to see the local Berkeley com-
munity become more involved in 
the affairs of the lab. 

"I'd also like to see a citizens' 
advisory board on the programs at 
the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Lab and to hdve n eighbors be 
able to serve on that board," 

Kelley said . "The University of 
California has treated the neigh-
bors of the Berkeley lab with a 
certain amount of arrogance. I'd 
like to see the local community 
more involved in the decision-
making process." 

With the management contract 
for the Los Alamos lab expiring in 
September, the Department of 
Energy expects to award a new 
contract by July. The UC man-
agement of the Los Alamos lab 
came under scrutiny after 3 series 
of safety and security violations in 
recent years. The university has 
also faced legal challenges over its 
treatment of laboratory employ-
ees. 

Last month, the University of 
California also showed a strong 
possibility of bidding for the Los 
Alamos lab when it partnered with 
the New Mexico Consortium, a 
group of science institutions, to 
collaborate on research between 
the institutions and the lab. 

In January, Tri-Valley 
C.A.R.E.S. announced its part-
nership with Nuclear Watch of 
New Mexico to submit a competi-
tive bid for the Los Alamos lab. 
The purpose of the bid was to 
influence the bidding process and 
to exemplify how the lab could 
be modified into a more civilian-
based facility, Kelley said. 

Both the university and Tri-
Valley C.A.R.E.S., among other 
competitors, are still awaiting the 
release of the request for propos-
als for the Los Alamos lab from 
the Department of Energy. The 
contract for the Livermore lab 
has been extended, according to 
Kelley. 

"The Deparonent of Energy 
recognized the important role 
and the benefits of a university 
managing a premier national lab-
oratory [with the Berkeley lab] ," 
Harrington said. "We sincerely 
hope that they recognize this 
important role in the Los Alamos 
and Livermore request for pro-
posals."

I ETCETERA ... 

I BRIEFLY 
Lesislature rejects 

immigrant tuition bill 
A state Assembly bill requiring public 

universities to charge illegal immigrants 
out-of-state tuition failed to receive 
even one vote in the Assembly's 
Higher Education Subcomminee, with 
six members voting against it. A similar 
bill was defeated earlier this month in 
a state Senate committee. with eight 
senators in opposition and two backing 
the measure. 

Introduced by two Republican law-
makers, the legislation would have 
amended a 2001 statute that allowed 
universities to offer resident tuition to 
certain students. 

Current law allows students to 
pay the cheaper in-state fees if they 
attend a California high school for at 
least three years and meet several 
other criteria. 

Backers of the new proposal 
argued that California taxpayers were 
wrongly subsidizing the education of 
nationals from other countries at a 
time when the state faced a massive 
budget crisis. However, critics of the 
bill contended that, unlike out-of-state 
students, illegal immigrants continue 
to pay state income and sales taxes. 

A more omnibus constitutional 
amendment that would deny ille-
gal immigrants most state services, 
offered by Assemblyman Mark 
Wyland (R-Del Mar), is still being con-
sidered by the Assembly's Judiciary 
Committee. If approved and signed 
by the governor. it would go before a 
statewide vote. 

Two dozen UC scholars 
elected to academy 
Twenty-four scholars who work for 

the University of California - including 
five UCSD professors - have been 
elected to the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences. 

This years inductees, among 213 
new fellows from around the world, 
include UC Provost and Senior Vice 
President of Academic Affairs M.R.C 
Greenwood. 

The organization, created more 
than 200 years ago, honors individu-
als for influential contributions to their 
field of study and to society. 

UCSD tied UC Berkeley for the 
most elected schola rs in the univerSity 
system thiS year. 

The new UCSD fellows include 
electrical and computer engineer-
ing professor Jack Keil Wolf, cellular 
and molecular medicine professor 
Ajit P. Varki, mathematics profes-
sors Linda Preiss Rothschild and M. 
Salah Baouendi a nd physics professor

Restrictions to sex 
education defeated 
Members of the state Assembly's 

Education Committee voted 9-2 earli-
er this month to reject new restrictions 
on sexual instruction that state-funded 
schools can provide to their pupils. 

The bill forbid schools from speaking 
or counseling students in first through 
sixth grades about specific sexual 
practices and would have required all 
other students to receive written parent 
approval. ~ listed practices "relating to 
beastiality, bisexuality, cunnilingus, fella-
tio, homosexuality, lesbianism, masoch-
ism, masturbation, necrophiHa, orgies, 
pederasty, pedophilia, sadism, sodomy, 
transexuality, transgenderism Dr trans-
vestism: according to the committee's 
analysis. 

Its author, Assemblyman Dennis L. 
Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), said the mea-
sure was needed to protect young 
kids from exposure to inappropriate 
and controversial sexual practices. 

"Schools need to teach biolo~ 
and not behavior," he stated in a Writ-
ten document backing the bill. 

Opponents, including the American 
Civil Liberties Union, had argued that 
the proposal restricted the ability of 
teachers to provide students with com-
prehensive and unbiased information. 

Giant bear to be added 
to stuart Collection 
A giant bear, sculpted by artist Tim 

Hawkinson, will become the 16th 
addition to the university'S Stuart 
Collection. 

The bear will arrive on campus on 
M~ 10 and will sit in the new Jacobs 
School of Engineering courtyard . 

Measuring more than 20 feet in 
height, the bear will be assembled 
for permanent placement through the 
end of this month. It will be made 
of eight granite boulders. The largest 
rock, used for the torso, will be moved 
at night with police escort on a 16-
axle truck, the type of vehicle used to 
transport space shuttle parts. 

Study: Diet exercise 
helps overweight kids 

In a study presented at the 
American Heart Association's confer-
ence, UCLA researchers have report-
ed that diet and exercise can improve 
a wide range of biomarkers linked to 
heart disease. 

The study is the first to show such 
wide benefits and was based on 
observations of overweight kids, ages 
nine to 15.

to get insi ght into how women arc 
feeling. It 's moving. You don't get 
to see that every day." 

Part of the night included open-
microphone testimonia ls in which 
men and women in the audience 
shared their personal experiences 
or those of friends who had been 
victims of sexual crimes. 

"The night is about taking own-
ership over what happened to you 
or a friend," Pillai said. "Victims of 
rape, for example, feel something 
was ta](en from them. This experi-
ence is part of the healing process." 

ERC junior Shannon Soria, 
a member of the WOInen's 
Commission, shared her own testi-
monial in last year's event. 

"It was the first time I told 
strangers," Soria said. "It made me 
stronger and not ashamed of what 
happened to me. 1t made me more 

comfortable. " 
All week long and during the 

night, the commission organized 
a table on Library Walk with such 
activities as the "Ring of Truth" 
where victims or people who knew 
victims could pin a white ribbon on 
a symbolic ring. Overall, the com-
mission raised 5700 for the Center 
of Community Solutions, a San 
Diego nonprofit organization that 
works on the treatment and preven-
tion of sexual crimes. 

CCS, along with other organi-
zations, set up tables to help sup-
port the night and raise awareness. 

"It's amazing how safe a space 
this is to break the silence," CCS 
sexual-assault victims advocate 
Vanessa Bramsburg said. "It's such 
a taboo subject. But this opens up 
a dialogue for gender and race to 
all imerconnect. It's a good place to 
address all that." 

During the night, a clothesline 
displaying shirts made by UCSD 
students was strung out behind the 
speakers, each shirt symbolizing 
the voice of a woman in a sexual 
crime. The shirrs were designed 
as a chance for women to "air out 
their dirty laundry" and tell their 
story as part of the healing process. 
Each color represented a different 
form of abuse. 

Participants ended the night 
with a march around campus . 

"We end with the march on a 
high, positive note with the feeling 
that I can do something," Pillai 
said. "We are owning the night." 

The April 28 event boasted its 
best attendance since its inception, 
and the committee said it hopes for 
an even larger turnout next year.

Beer: Plan included precautionary measures 
continued from page I 

"In recognition of the 'grow-
ing' awareness of alcohol use dur-
ing the day - and sometimes prior 
- leading up to the concert, A.S. 
Programming and UEO staff have 
developed a number of proactive 
mC2sures that begin to address the 
culture of alcohol consumption at 
this event," the UEO recommenda-
tion stated. "It is the firm belief that 
the listed strategies must first be fully 
implemented, in order to seriously 
consider the possibility of a beer gar-
den during the evening concert." 

The office recommended that 
Watson approve a beer garden next 
year, when the measures were firm -
ly in place. 

Pae aid the precautions to high-
light safety and control alcohol con-
sumption justified a beer garden 

for this year's Sun God festival. 
Measures proposed by the council 
and UEO included the prohibi-
tion of alcohol and alcohol-related 
merchandise, a designated-driver 
program and increased staffing and 
security. Watson accepted all of the 
proposed "proactive measures." 

"J feel disheartened that all 
of these security measures were 
taken out of safety concerns, 
[but] a beer garden was sti ll not 
approved," Pae said. "If it's not 
going to happen this year with all 
of these proactive actions taking 
place, when will it?" 

With over 40 percent of stu-
dents of drinking age, the UCSD 
population would have been able 
to more fully enjoy the festival 
with a beer garden , accord ing to 
Pae. During previous meetings, 

although Watson was not enthusi-
astic about the prospect of serving 
alcohol at the event, he was not 
opposed to the idea, Pae said. 

"A.S. did everything in our 
power to make Sun God a safe event 
regarding a1cohol," she said. "We 
were under the impression that if 
we took these measures, a safe beer 
garden would be accepted." 

Watson maintained that while 
h e is not against a beer garden, Sun 
God is not yet safe enough for such 
an operation. 

"I'm not opposed to the princi-
ple of a beer garden," Watson said. 
"But safety comes first, and a beer 
garden does not contribute to that 
under the circumstances."

Catholics take a ste~ back to breathe 
By HANNA CAMP .ad ' 

CAROL FlEIIE , 
Staff Writers 

I f you're waiting for 2.. great schism in the Catholic church following the election of 
Cardinal Joseph Ral'%inger to the 
papacy, don't hold your breath:' 
The schism in political verdict has 
certainly been predictable. One 
camp views Ratt.inger's election as . 
a marked shift rightward, while 
the other is bdt exemplified by 
Gerard Baker's April 21 I.tmtJq" 
Times headline: "Shock'! New Pope 
a Catholic." But in the midst of all 
this, American Catholics themselves 
aren't 1$ polarized along political 
lines as people seem to thlnk. Many 
are reserving judgment and main-
taining hope for dialogue within 
the church under the new Pope 
Benedict XVI. 

It's a smart move, and not 
only because Catholics ought . to 
have faith that God MS guided 
the papal election process; it's 
simply the most prudent way to 
look at the situation. Although 
the former cardinal is considered 
conservative, assigning political 
labels to theology is overly sim-
plistic. Progressives remember 
that he was a driving force behind 
Vatican II and a voice in the anti-
fraq war movement, and tradi-
tionalists mow that he was a main 
backer of John Paul U's theologi-
cal positions on sexual mores and 
church orthodoxy. 

According to an April 25 
Washington Post/ABC Nnvs poll , 
more than eight in 10 Catholics 
broadly suppOrt the selection of 
Cardinal Ratzinger to replace Pope 
John Paul II. Pleased or not with 
the election, they arc willing to give 
the new pontiff a chance regard-

Ics~ of their own political affilia-

tion. LyDn Neu, pastoral associate 
from the Newman Center Catholic 
Community at VCSD, anittors this 
sentiment. "People have some con-
cerns, but let'. Mit and see," she 
said. 

In many circles, a deepei and 
perhaps more legitimate cause 
for COllcern is the possibility that 
he will promote strict and rigid 
orthodoxy. Before , his election, 
Benedict ,rathe! jnfamously wrote 
that Catholic politician. who 
are pro-c;hoice may be denied 

VCSD alumnus Oc:taVio Garcia 
i$ with the majority who are J1Qt 
yet- alarmed by the 
choice of Ratzinger. 

,. coinmunion. 
But rather tho 
wringiilg thei~ 
haJlds in fear, 
many Catholics 
simply hope that 

"I 2l1l c~tcnt with 
the election of this 
new pope," he said. 
". r.' There are other 
issues in the ."~ 
such as wl,lether 

~men , should be 
allowed to be priests, 
whether priest should 
marry, etc. These are 
dif6cult topics that I 
find no we and &ir 
answer to, INr I have 
faith that this next 
pontiff win guide the 
church in the correct: 
direction." 

Eleanor Roosevelt 
College fourth-year 
Uyen Doan is less 
optimistic. "1 person-
ally would rather have 
them elect a little bit 
younger -and less-
conservative pope," 
Doan said. MHis posi-
tions are very similar 
to John Paul II's, and 
I don't foresee a radi-
cal alteration in the 
church's decrees any 
time 5000." 

" There is a chance

communities, and 
the world itself, 
would be better

period as a 
breather. " 

whether or not the 
pope wiu listen is 
still up in the air, 
but it's not unrea-
sonable to suppose 
that he will. The 
elevation to pope 
must be a dizzy-
ing one, some-
what comparable 
to an appoilltment 
to the Supreme 

Those who had been hoping for 
such a radical alteration, or a Latin 
American or African pope, find 
comfort in Benedict XVI' predict-
ed transitory nature. At 78 years 
old, his papacy is not expected to 
last as long as John Paul U's, who 
was elected at 58. 

Court but on a far grander scale. 
He has the job for life, his 

authority is secure, and his dec -
larations on doctri ne and justice 
will be regarded as carrying the 
force of 13w. Such ~ job descrip-
tion must inevitably promote 
refl ecti on and has heen known 

to produc~ changes in methods, 
mentalities and even ideals in jus-
tices and popes alike. 

So far, indications are that he 
does feel a responsibility to promote 
dialogue., "At his official ins~lla­
tion. Pope Benedict XVI said that 
he was committed to listening,' 

, &ald :Father Dominic DeLay of 
, the Newman Center. "That's very 
encoUraging. I'm praj1ng to Pope 
John Paul n for our new pope 
and 'the church." Father Fone also 
hopes that Benedict XVI , utilizes 
his transitional reign proactively to 
define 11 unified . Catholic identity. 

There i$ a chance, of course, 
that Benedict will choose to focus 
more . on holding fast to doctrine 
and shoring up onhodozy on issues 
of sexual mores. Butevdl iibe does, 
the wOrld's Catholic communities, 
and the world itself, would be bet-
ter terftd by taking this period as 
a breather. it may De enjoyable, if 
se1f-aggrandUing, to imagine that 
a newly elected national or intema-
tionalleader will greatly impact our 
lives - but in a democratic state, 
this is rarely so. 

Everyday life has changed little, 
if at aU, for most Americans since 
George W. Bush's re-election, and 
the lives of Catholic Americans 
will likely remain unchanged 
due to Pope Benedict XVI. The 
notion that one may split from the 
Catholic Church and found or join 
another Christian religion is by 
definition a Protestant notion, and 
when Pope Benedict XVI is enjoy-
ing a honeymoon approval rating 
of over 80 percent, the time has 
not yet come to worry about any 
political schism. This is a chance to 
re-open debate on religious iden-
tities and perspectives, and that 
would serve everyone better than 
agonizing over who will support 
what political cause .

UCSD ID cards not 
totally useless 

Don't forget 
the joker I 

Cody Nabours 

I norted lmpanemty tor abou t seven minutes, paci ng down a 15 -o r- 0 meter stretch of 
sidewalk in front of Macy's. I was 
anxious because I had an appoint-
ment, the kind of appoinmlent 
where they keep you in a vinyl 
office chair, strap a shower cap 
filled with electrodes to your 
melon and ask you to click a but-
tOn whil e colorful lights blink on 
and off. ... Or something like that. 
Knowing that it takes the shuttles 
somewhere between 20 and 25 
minutes to take me from UTC, 
on the easternmost end of the 
route, to Mandeville, my time was 
slowly running ou:. 

The first indication of the 
shuttle is always the sound of 
the jakc brake as the bus makes 
the final turn into the southern 
driveway of the mall. At this 
sound, I instinctually whipped 
Ollt my wallet, flopped it open, 
and reached for my student ID 
card. In its place was nothing but 
empty leather. I thought back to 
Chipotle the day before, when I 
dropped it back into my jacket's 
lapel pocket, and replayed this 
scene about four times , each time 
ending with the image in my 
mind 's eye of the jacket slumped 
over the back of my kitchen 
chair, the ID burning a hole in 
the pocket of the jacket, along 
with the three dollars 1 probably 
left in there - approxi mately 

one quarter of my nct worth. 
"Big fucking deal," I thuught, 
absolutely sure that the combllla -
rion of sym path y, lily hOll~c Ihlrt 
from tirst year in the res. h,llls 
and a bag full of notes for UCSD 
classes could vouch for m)' id~n­
tity enough to gel me one rid c 
witholll 1l1y 10. I, of cuur~e, was 
mistaken. Somewhere in ,\ \cGlll 
hall , a researcher penalized some 
unconscionab le assholc for mak-
ing an experiment appointment 
and never showi ng up. 

The eyes of the shuttle driver 
to ld me thar she was afraid, afraid 
of the consequences for helping 
out a fellow studcnt again t her 
orders to enforce ID on the shur-
tle. If the dri ver had heen one of 
the aged "career drivers," I could 
have forgiven them; it is only 
from fellow students thar I expect 
the sympathy that I would afford 
any of them. So I drove home and 
fetched my 10 (and three dol-
lars) out of my limp jacket. What 
would you do? 

In . ord er to get onto a 
Cityshu![le these days (a nywhere 
except at the Mandeville stop), 
you must have a UC D 10. You 
must pull the 10 Out frolll behind

II hat are our motives to travel? Escapism is on the top of the list - we travel to withdraw from our books, to resign from our jobs, to 
exit our overextended relationships, to quit our free-
ways, our computers, our polite conversations and the 
habits that serve as accomplices to our daily routines. 
In short, we travel to break loose from our lives. 

Very seldom do we travel to "participate." In our 
mind, travel is a point of departure, not arrival. We 
envision the airport and the hotel, but we forget the 
middle intrigues that can fill an experience. Our famil· 
iarity with a place is often limited to cultural landmarks: 
food, architecture, sign language, particular routes 
we took, broken language lessons from the natives. 
Sometimes we climb into a rickshaw, ride a camel 
or devour escargot But in the end, at night, we retire 
back to our hotel rooms, climb into bed, tum off the 
fluorescent lamps and drift to sleep in the comfort of 
homogenous sterility. 

Somevvhere along the lines, we miss the very expe-
riences that capture the spirit of a locale. We let the 
worst of our routines get the best of our curiosity; we 
fall back to borin& to the everyday, even as we surren· 
der a thousand dollars in our escape to the exotic. 

Regardless of town or country, our motives to travel 
are driven by our insatiable appetite for the exotic. 
For us San Diegans, the word "exotic" rarely inspires 
images of a surfboard collection, thatched roofs, salm-
on pink walls or a deck overlooking the Pacific Ocean 
- these images have long slipped into our vocabulary 
of commons sights. But the Banana Bungalow Hostel 
settled in a cul-de-sac along the boardwalk of Pacific 
Beach offers visitors to San Diego just these sights, 
interesting in their excess. 

Under new management 
for over two years, Banana 
Bungalow is currently 
undergoing major restorations. 
Kiwi native Michelle Aftimos, 
the hostel's manager, attests 
to its reputation as a party 
place. Located directly on the 
beach, the hostel offers visitors 
a wealth of activities, from its 
evening masquerade balls to 
a school-themed disco night 
and the beloved safari tours 
in the Califomia desert. 

An outstretched table duttered 
with tourist brochures, beer 
bottles, magazines, postcards, 
a guest book and personal 
items serves as the watering 

I for visitors and guests, 
who gather to share banters 
and make friends.

Tom Wolfe studies the ways 
of college students in depth 
Book views sex, drugs and parties on campus 

through the eyes of an innocent freshman 
By FABIANNE FURMAN 

Staff Writer 

What does a 74-year-old man 
know about demanding profes-
sors, time-consuming homework 
and sleepless nights of studyi ng for 
future-threatening final s? Beuer 
yet, what does a 74-year-old man 
know about dorm life, alcohol, 
frat parties and sex? What could 
any man at this age know about 
the plight of the modern col-
lege student? If that Illan is Tom 
Wolfe, he is just as wise to the 
ways of college li fe as any college 
student, male or female , 

In his most recent novel, "I am 
Charlotte Simmon ," Tom Wolfe 
outlines the highs and lows of col-
lege life wi'th surprising accuracy. 
This fictional novel is an inti-
mate walk in the shoes of nerds, 
star athletes, malleable freshman 
gi rls, frat boys, indignant profes-
sors, clueless parents and nostalgic 
alumni. Wolfe's journalistic abi lity 
to include various viewpoints and 
motives projects these elements in 
an unbiased glimpse of the college 
experience. 

Despi te its thickness, this 
700-page book is a quick read. 
Although Wolfe outlines each 
scenario in great detajl, he is never 
excessive or boring. The writing is 
easy to read, mostly colloquial and 
casual, though sometimes loud 
and fra ntic, as college rends to 
be. 

T he majority of the book is 

a first-hand observation of col-
lege life, as seen through the vir-
gi nal eyes of Charlotte Simmons. 
C harlotte, the novel 's principal 
character, is a geeky academic 
prodigy from a small town in 
North Carolina. Before actually 
beginning her university educa-
tion, she envisions college as an 
answer to her prayers, an intellec-
tual foundation in whjch she will 
find students who share her hun-
ger for knowledge. She imagines 
that high school trivialities like 
"cliques, hookups, drinking [andl 
resentments" will become merely 
a thing of the past as she find s 
her place at the ficti onal Dupont 
University. 

Needless to say, Charlone's 

vision of college does not exactly 
come to life as she experiences 
her first taste of coed bathrooms, 
offensive rap lyrics and "serile" -
getting locked out of a dorm room 
while a roommate engages in ran-
dom, cas ual sex. The unpleasant 
surprises of coll ege life do not stop 
in the dormi tory for Charlotte. 
She is appalled by the shameless 
activities that occur at fraternity 
parties. She is incen cd over the 
anention and special treaonent 
"dummy" athletes receive. She is 
surprised to find that it is more 
difficult to be accepted to col-
lege than it is to actually stay in 
college. And she is baffled by tile 
fact that students who were smart 
enough to be accepted to such a 
prestigious unjversity arc capabl e 
of such poor behavior. 

Charlotte begins to assimilate 
to college life when her natural 
beauty and innocence provoke a 
great deal of exually tense situ-
ations. Despite Charlotte's con-
servative values about the way 
young men and women should 
behave in a setti ng of hormone-
crazed young adu lts and com-
petitive gi rls, it is difficult for her 
to resist the temptation of male 
attention, alcohol and sex. When 
Charlotte finds that she does not 
always understand the intentions 
of college boys or even girls and 
that the choices she makes are not 
always the best, she begins to dis-

Book 
. . 

review: 
Critics say book 

exaggera tes 
contin~d from page 10 

trust everyone, including herself. 
The principal conflict of the 

novel is Charlotte's struggle to 
maintain her values and identity 
without isolating herself from every-
one around her. She grapples with 
finding a middle ground between 
assimilation to college life and self-
preservation, Ironically, Charlotte's 
most valuable learning experiences 
happen outside the classroom. 

Many critics of "I am Charlotte 
Simmons" consider the novel over-
ly dramatic or exaggerated, but this 
re2ction is to be expected, Most of 
these critics are middle-aged and 
several years out of college. To 
them, the events of the novel may 
seem a bit outrageous, but it is fair 

" It is this imperfection that causes the reaJers to 
identify with the 

characters in the story -
and this is ooy the 000k

~ attentlon. 

to say that the average adult would 
react in the same way to the real-
life events of college. Important 
situations show up out of nowhere, 
often ca tching students off-guard 
and unprepared to respond caJml y 
and carefully. The novel depicts the 
rash decisions students are forced 
to make both in their socia l and 
academic lives. 

While Charlotte Simmons and 
Dupont University are fictional, the 
author's experien~es certainly are 
not. Through five years of research 
at prestigious universities, includ-
ing consultations with linguists and 
sociologists, interviews with stu-
dents and even visits to fratern ity 
parties, Wolfe observed authentic 
college experiences and applied 
them to hi s nove l. T he fact that 
the book is based on true eve nts 
makes it unpredictable; one docs 
not expect characters in a book 
to behave as imperfectly as actual 
peopl e. It is this imperfection that 
ca uses readers to identify with the 
characters and the story - and this 
is why tile book deserves attention.

Tritons beat 
fifth .. seeded 
UC Berkeley 

continued from page ,6 
home from Texas proud and excited 
about a table tennis team that could 
contend for a championship in the 
years to come. They are already 
recruiting for next year and hope to 
garner more interest in the sport. 

"We're always loolcing for new 
players, and we encourage any inter-
ested guys and girls to join us dur-
ing our Wednesday night practices 
in RIMAC," Plaisted said after the 
retuTn from Texas. 

The team was extremely proud 
of placing higher than USC and UC 
Berkeley, their main competition in 
California. The.ir fourth-place fin-
ish makes them the best team in 
California and the best team west 
of Texas, behind national champion 
Texas Wesleyan University. 

MONDAY, MAY 2, 2005 

Joe: Los Angeles Lakers fans 
forced to wonder, what if? 

continued from page ,6 
trade up for the Hornets' first-
round pick at 18. With the pick. 
Jackson selects NCAA Player of 
the Year Jameer Nelson, a high-
quality, smart player similar to 
Jason Kidd . 

Jackson assembles a team of 
winners. As. the GM, he looks 
over his own coaching style and is 
able to modify the triangle. 

The team is special. They 
are strong out of the gate, play-
ing smart and working well with 
one another. Nelson, Fisher and 
Johnson work perfectly together 
distributing the ball, and Jackson 
is able to get optimal defensive 
intensity out of each. Shaq is a 
monster on the boards, but begins 
to defer to Kobe when need be, 
and Kobe in rum becomes opti-
mistic and upbeat. Malone helps 
by soothing the egos of Shaq 
and Kobe, and at the same time 
amalgamates the new guys into 

the team annosphere. The Lakers 
lock up the number-one seed in 
the Western Conference playoffs. 

The Lakers storm through the 
playoffs, losing only twice. This 
team resembles the 200 I squad 
that suffered its on ly loss to the 
Sixers in game one of the Finals . 

The Lakers get their rematch: 
Detroit-Los Angeles. They are 
prepared this time. Detroit is 
not. The Lakers sweep the series. 
Shaq is again the MVP, and Kobe 
realizes that Shaq is on the wa y 
out and it is best to play the 
supporting role until he is ready 
to take over the shi p. The tea m 
is jubilant, ecstatic, encompassed 
by emotions this group had never 
experienced before . T hey are 
revived . They get their revenge . 
They get their redemption. 

And then the book is allowed 
to end, in the only way it could 
have been.

Table tennis places fourth 

Tritons compete at National Championships 
By RAn ENTEEN 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD table tennis team 
fini hed off irs first season as a 
competitive squad by finishing 
founh in the CoUegiate National 
Table Tennis Championships in 
Ft. Worth, Texas, April 1 through 
April 3. 

A table tennis club staned more 
than 10 years ago at UCSDj how-
ever, this year was the first that the 
members of the club organized and 
fonned a team. As a rookie squad, 
the Tritons were not expected to do 
as weU a they did in their maiden 
voyage, making it to the National 
Championships and becoming the 
founh-best table tennis team in the 
country. However, a tie with the 
University of Southern California 
for fir t place in the Southern 
California Division gave them a 
wild-card benh to the champion-
ship and a trip to Texas. 

Given the opponunity to play 
at a higher level, the Tritons did 
nothing but impress opponent after 
opponent with their incredible play. 
The team, made up of Derrick 
Poon, Tom Plaisted, WaUace Liu, 
Alan Nash and Ardi Banhiamad, 
who couldn't make it to Texas, 
played weU enough to get to the 
second round of play. They fin-
ished only behind the University of 
Maryland in their group, earning a 
spot alongside the Terrapins in the 
quanerfinals. 

The sixth-seeded Tritons faced 
UC Berkeley, the fifth seed, in the 
quanerfinals and won a very close 
match, 3-2. The win put them 
up against the second seed, the 
University of Southern Mississippi, 
in the semifinal match. The team 
jumped out to a 2-0 lead after 
Plaisted and Poon beat their two 
best players in the first two games. 
The Tritons were within one 
game of the finals, but Southern 

Mississippi's weaker players man-
aged to beat Liu and Nash in the 
third and founh games to tie the 
match up, 2-2. 

With the match on the line, 
Southern Mississippi won the deci-
sive doubles game to advance to 
the finals, leaving UCSD· to play 
Maryland in the third-place match. 
The Terrapins, led by top U.S. 
Olympic and U.S. World team 
contender Han Xiao, pulled off a 
3-1 win in the match, notching a 
third-place finish in the champi-
onship and dropping UCSD to 
fourth. However, a Final Four fin-
ish in a rookie season is nothing to 
be ashamed of. 

"As a rookie team this year, our 
fourth-place finish in the Nationals 
put UCSD on the map of strOl:g 
table tennis teams in U.S. collegiate 
table tennis," Plaisted said.

A Lakers fan's fin_al fantasy 
cup 0' 
. Joe 

Joe Tevelowitz 

T.he Lakers fell in five to the Pistolls, an upset that few 
would have imagined. It 

didn 't fit the story. It didn't make 
sense with everything else going 
on. This couldn't be the end. 
This couldn 't be the finale. Karl 
Malone still didn't have a ring. 
Phil Jackson had lost in the finals. 
Lakers lose. Lakers lose? 

This cou ldn 't be the final chap-
ter. That can 't be the back of the 
book. There has to be redemp-
tion. This chapter in Lakers his-
tory cannot be laid to rest like 
this. 

And so ... what if? 
Following the loss, Lakers 

coach Phil Jackson is unsure of 
how to addre s his team; he is 
un ure if he'd ever be able to 
go on. Shaqui lle 0' ea l didn't 
want to play with Kobe Bryant. 
Kobe wanted to be a star. Shaq 
wanted more - more respect, 
more prestige and more admira-
tion . Karl Malone still wanted 
a ring. Gary Payton wished he 
could have acted better, phyed 
better been better. 

To keep Jackson, owner Jerry 

Buss bestows upon him the gener-
al manager duties. It's something 
Jackson has always desired. He has 
watched San Antonio Spurs head 
coach Gregg Popovich handle the 
rigors of being both a coach and 
a GM and knows that he too 
could handle the dual tasks. His 
first action is to decide which 
players do and do not fit within 
his system. Immediately his deci-
sion is made to not pick up Gary 
Payton 's option, a mutual agree-
ment on both sides. Rick Fox 
is pressured into reti rement, and 
Jackson keeps Karl, and Karl stays 
because he believes in Jackson. 
Shaq is a given. With Phil on 
board, he is happy and secure in 
his position within the team, and 
likes the looks of players such as 
Malone, Derek Fisher and Luke 
Walton - men who will stand 
beside him, allow him to be the 
genera l. He is too stubborn to 
admit that this team is incom-
plete, that there are holes and that 
there needs to be more. And then, 
there is Kobe. 

The Los Angeles Clippers and 
the Phoenix Suns offer Bryant 
huge urns of money. Phoenix 
dreams of an Amare-Kobe con-
nection and see the pos ibilities 
a limitless, especia lly with young 
Leandro Barbo a maturing into 
his position as the point guard. 
The C lipper also enjoy the 
thought of a marquee player, but 

they are holding back a little. No 
matter how hard they seem to be 
pushing, owner Donald Sterling 
doesn't really want Kobe. Kobe, 
however, .is mentally weakened. 
He has always been insecure, and 
it becomes increasingly obvious 
to him that he would never be 
able to leave the Los Angeles 
Lakers at this point, after all their 
upport. Bryant signs. 

Shaq is now put at a cross-
roads. Jackson says nothing to 
him before Shaq and Kobe are 
to come face-to-face. He knows 
that Shaq will need to choose his 
course alone, and if he chooses 
the most beneficial course to the 
team, they will go far. 

The Lakers focus on person-
ality, position and need. Center 
Michael Doleac is a good pickup 
and former Indiana Pacers point 
guard Anthony Johnson seems 
like a step down from Payton. Jon 
Barry is a late signing, but pos-
sibly the most important. 

And it goes ... beautifully. 
Shaq rea lizes this is his chance to 
change things and wants to be the 
one to do that. Kobe aJso realizes 
that the re is a better course of 
action . . . for bim. Both will never 
be best friends, but they decide 
to be friends. Jackson smiles a 
he sees it all coming together. 
On draft day, Jackson is able to

Softball struggles, goes 
1-3 in last four games 

Tritons lose to Azusa, split 
against Cal State San Bernardino 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite a heroic Herculean 
effon led by sophomore outfielder 
Brittni Carino, UCSD lost a heart-
breaking doubleheader to Azusa 
Pacific on April 28. The Cougars 
wrestled the first game outright 
from the Tritons with a score of 
7-2, and then narrowly won the 
nightcap, 3-1. The team's luck ran 
out on April 29, however, as UCSD 
was winless in two games. 

In the April 29 nightcap, fresh-
man third baseman Jenny Maze 
put the Tritons (19-29 overall, 11-
16 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) up 1-0 with a solo 
homer in the second inning and 
added another run in the third . 

Freshman shortstop Danielle 
Lukk stole second and cored 
on sophomore second baseman 
Dallas H ernandez's single, and 
walked on a Coyote pitching 
error. 

The Tritons made it 3-0 for the 
right-handed sophomore ptcher 
Tina Rowe in the fifth as Lukk 
scored again on Hernandez' ground 
ball to second. 

However, the Coyotes reached 
Rowe for three runs to tie the 
game at 3-3. 

UCSD's attempt to regain the 
lead in the sixth failed when fresh-
man outfielder Randelle Bundy 
was thrown out at the plate to 
retire the side after Carino sin-
gled. . 

However, the Tritons scored 
three in the seventh on an RBI 
double by senior outfielder 
Breanne Cope and Maze's second 
homer of the game. 

Carino, Lukk, Cope and Maze 
each had two hits for the Tritons 
in game two. 

In the opener against Cal State 

San Bernardino that morning, the 
Tritons were hammered in the 
first game by a score of 9-1. 

UCSD took a 1-0 lead in the 
first inning of game one on junior 
outfielder Jenny Spencer's RBI 
infield single. 

However, the Coyotes tied it 
at 1-1 in the second inning on a 
massive home mn. The Coyotes 
later empted for five runs in the 
fourth on a series of doubles. 

With a lead of 6-1 , the Coyotes 
finished the game on an RBI dou-
ble along with a two-run home 
run for a 9-1 final score. 

The opener was shortened to 
five innings by the mercy rule. 

However, the Tritons held on 
for a 6-5 victory in the nightcap 
behind two home runs and three 
RBIs by Maze and the pitching 
of Rowe. 

The second ga me on April 28 
saw Carino leadi ng an attempt to 
split the serie . . 

Her one-out single scored 
Cope to put the Tritons up 1-0 in 
the ixth inning. 

However, the Cougars snapped 
out of their slump and managed 
to tie the game by the bottom 
half of the inning, thank to a few 
strong hits. 

In the day's opener, the Tritons 
surged ahead 1-0 when the third 
batter of the game, senior catcher 
Jamie Hurst, cranked her third 
home run of the season, a solo 
shot over the left- field fence . 

Nevertheless, the Cougars 
used a four-hit, four-run fourth 
inning to break open a close game 
and assume a 6- 1 lead. 

The Cougars did not relin-
quish their sizable margin of vic-
tory for the rest of the game. 

The Tritons will be back in 
action May 7 against Grand 
Canyon University.
