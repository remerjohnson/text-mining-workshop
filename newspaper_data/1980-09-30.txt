Students of various cultural backgrounds at 
UCSD will be represented in a Cultural Unity Day of 
Awareness on Oct. 3 from 11 am to 6 pm by the gym 
steps. 

The Black Student Union, Asian American

refreshments, food (for a price), theater and dancing. 

Lehman Brightman will speak for UAIS, Allan 
Nishio for AASA, Isreal Chavez for MEChA and 
Bernard Ashcraft for the Black Student Union. 

CUDA co-chair Meg Thornton aims to build 
"a solid base" for the cultu-ral awarenell groups on 
this campus. "I want to have people get involved, and 
to see what kinds of services are offered," Thornton 
says.

Spiess Leads Sea Operations in Search 
BY BLAKE SHAW 

Imagine the year 1912. The 
largest, most luxurious ship ever 
built embarks on her maiden 
voyage from Southampton, 
England, to New York City. On 
board are many European and 
American elites. Four days later 
she strikes an iceberg and sinks into 
the depths of the north Atlantic , 
taking with her 1,600 of the 2,200 
passengers aboard. 

Then imagine, in the summer of 
1980~ a crew of scientists on board 
a liS-foot research vessell 
attempting to locate film and salv~e the remains of this ship. 

The ship, of course, is the 
"unsinkable' Titanic The research 
vessel is the HWJ Fay, whose crew 
of scientists from Columbia 
University's Geological Observa· 
t~ was led by Dr. Fred Soiess of 
Scripps Institution of Oceano· 
graPily. 

'The man behind the search is 
Texas oil millionaire and 
adventurer Jack Grimm. His 
search for adventure has led him to 

seek Noah 's Ark the Loch Ness 
Monster and Big Foot. He has now 
turned his .ights to locating the 
Titanic, which has rested 13,000 
feet beneath the sea since its widely 
Q.ublicized di aster 68 years ago. 
Grimm hopes to benefit from bOok 
rights and television documentary 
coverage of the expedition. 

He chose Scripp s ' Dr. Spiess to 
head the research crew because of 
Spiess's . long involvement in 
oceanic investigation and 
eXQerience as a leader. 

Dr. Spiess, in addition to being a 
professor of oceanography at 
Scripps and the director of the UC 
Institute of Marine Resources, is an 
active seagoing scientist. He leads 
at least two ex~tions each rear, 
and is expert m both ocean floor 
geology and the design and 
operation of deep-towed instrument 
s'ystems used for charting the ocean 
floor. 

This technical knowJe4ge and 
his past leadership of ship location 
and salvage o~rations for the US 
Navy made him the likely, if not 

Women Take Back the 
San Diego Night Oct. 4 

On S~turday evening, 
Oct. 4, 1980, thousands 
of women and concerned men 
will participate in the first "San 
Dietro Women Take Back the 
Night" rally and march in 
downtown San Diego, to 
protest the increasing problem 
of violence against wornen. 

"San Diego Women Take 
Back the Night" will begin at 5 
pm, with a pre-march raOy at 
15th and C Streets (San Diego 
City College Student Center, 
free parking), led ~)' Danuta, 
co-host of KFMB TV's 
program Sun Up, and 
featurin, speaker:s Ashley 
Walker-Hooper and Adrian 
Berlin, YWCA'. Battered 
Women's SErvices; Carol 
Rowell, Center for Women'. 
Studies and Services; and 
Betty Brooks, insbudor of 
women's self defense at 

California State College at 
Long Beach. 

Facilities for the disabled 
and the hearing impaired will 
be J!rovided. 

The march will begin at 7 
pm, from 12th and C Streets, 
and candle· and sign-carrying 
participants will proceed west 
on E Street, through the San 
Diego ~graphy district 
surrounding Horton Plaza, 
and return to City College via 
Broadway. Candles, T-shirts 
and posters will be available at 
the rally and after the march. 

"San Diego Women Take

after similar protests in San

perfect choice to lead the sea 
o~rations of the search. 

The first stage of the search took 
Q.lace last July and August. 
Participating scientists had a 
straightforward plan: They would 
uae a deep. towed sonar device, 
similar to one developed at Scripps, 
to chart a 500·squart-mile area of 
ocean floor , centered around the 
distress position of the Titanic. 
This would identify any "Titanic· 
shaped" objects as candidates for 
closer study. 

More detailed sonar studies 
would be made of these sites, 
coupled with the use of a 
magnetometer, a sensitive 
magnetic field detector which can 
determine. if objects are metallic or 
sir¥ly geological formations. 

nle search was more difficult 
than anticipated. The 13,OOO.foot 
depth obVIously was a problem.

expected to find still, cold waters

Money Squeeze Gets 
Newsroom In Its Grasp 

Running a newspaper g costly, aa one might expect. We 
believe that students have the right to know how our budget 
operalel. With thia in mind, we would like to give you a 
better idea of just how we get our paper out every day. 

Three yeara ago, when the Triton Times went 
"independent," the Regiatralion Fee Committee set 81ide 
$25,000 as an "emergency fund" to cover the paper in the 
event that it ahould lose money. 

Since then, the newlp8per now - Th~ Daily quardian 
_ baa continued to forego direct funding by either the 
AlIOCiated Students Conununication Board or the Reg 
Fee Committee. Instead, we have financed our operations 
through the IOlicitation of advertiaemenll. 

We get our ca.h from three basic sources. Off.campus 
advertiaer., who provide the bulk of our income, spend 
upwards of $80,800 per year. Another important source is 
on-campua advertiser., both student ~ departJnenta!. 
They receive 16 percent to 62IJz percent dIscounts on their 
buainell, and provide us with approximately $43,000 
amually. F"Jnally, the Chancellor'. Office provides us with 
between $5,000 and $7,500 payment for our publishing of 
the weekly calendar of evenll. 

AU of our money i. depo.ited with the univer.ity, which 
operates a series 01 accounts to handle our transaction •. If 
our paper has a aurplua, the amount i. carried on the books 
for future use. When there ia a deficit, the univeraity covers 
the lhortfaD with ita operating funda until we can generate 
enouah revenue to balance our accounll. 

At the end of Ncb June, our paper - a. well a. all other 
atudent organizations - muat have all accounll balanced 
for the univeraity'. "fiscal clo.ing." 

Thi. put year, we faced the deadline with a $17,000 
deficit. 

AI a ahort-tenn solution, $15,000 W81 transferred from 
Campu. Activity Fees to bring our account into balance on 
June 30. On the foUowihgday, the money was returned to 
its proper acc~t. 

At this time, therefore, we continue to 81sume 
responsibility for paying our bill •. Thia haa meant cutting 
editorial .a1aries, reducing our staff and tightening up on 
expenses. In the meantime, the university continues to 
cover our expenses out of ill operating funds, and all our 
profits are fed back into that account. 

This year we will avoid some of last year's expenses, 
which included moving to our new offices and purchasing 
new equipinent. To continue providing the campus with 
daily newspaper coverage, we will need to exercise even 
more caution with our budget.

Student Unionism is a Great Idea, 
But CSEA IS not the Answer 
Editor: the least, a waste of time. 

It is gratifyin,,- although somewhat out of 
character, to see The Doily Guardian come out 
in support of student unionism (or unionism of 
any kind) - especially after the role played by 
your paper in the smashing of the Student 
Cooperative Union in 1977. Your sUjgestion, 
however . that Itudenta .hould join the California 
State Employeea Auociation (CSEA) - an 
organization founded some years 880 for the 

pu~ae of selling insurance - is unfortunate. 
CSEA il not a union, and has never been one. 

Your call is especially perplexing in view of the 
existance of a real union on campus -AFSCME 
(the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees). Not only is AFSCME a 
real union, it has long had a policy of adrnittting 
student workers as members, and many students 
have from time to time belonged. In fact, in 1976 
when the Graduate Student Union decided to 
affiliate with a union, they joined AFSCME. 

AFSCME has been working to organize the 
campus while CSEA has issued ill "ashy 
spectacles - getting media coverage for such 
"eventa" as the recruitment of one student 
member. And it is AFSCME which has called the 
coming elections, in which UC workers will 
finally become able to be officially represented by 

For studenta, or anyone for that matter, to place 
collective bargaining rights in the hands of an 
agency which has supported historically, and to 
this day, the most vile and outlandish calls for 
union busting (see, for example, the Grapeviner, 
CSEA newsletter, Augult issue) would be, to say . please turn to page 10

FDA Says Tampons 
Need Warning Labels 

WASHINGTON - The 
Food and Drug Administra-
tion said yesterday it has 
asked five major tampon 
manufacturers to put warning 
labels voluntarily on all boxes 
and brands of tampons. 

The agency reiterated it 
plans to propose a rule 
requiring a label warning 
women that tampons pose a 
risk of the rare but deadly 
disease called toxic shock 
syndrome. 

In the meantime, it has sent 
telegrams to the manufactur-
ers "strongly recommending" 
that they add the warning now~ 
as a responsible consumer 
protection step on their part. 

The agency suggested this 
wording: 
"Toxic shock syndrome TSS 
is a rare but serious di~p"se 
that can occur in menstruatinv, 
women. TSS can cause death. 
The disease has been 
associated with the use of 
tampons. You may therefore 
want to consider not using 
tampons or alternating 
tampons with napkins. If you 
develop high fever and 
vomiting or diarrhea during 
your menstrual period, you 
should remove your tampon 
immediatdy and talk to a 
ph .. " lSlClan. 

FDA spokesman Wayne 
Pine. said the telegrams went 
out over the weekend to the 
heads of International 
Playtex, maker of Playtex 
tampon; T ampax, maker of 
Tampax; Kimberly-Clark, 
Kotex; Johnson & Johnson, 
obi Campana, Purseltes. 

A sixth manufacturer, 
Procter & Gamble, recently 
recalled all of its Rely tampons 
and is preparing to launch a 
major advertising campaign to 
tdl women not to use them. 

Studies indicated Rely was 

used by an unusually hillh 
percentage of women who got 
the disease, But the syndrome 
has also been found in women 
who used other brands and in 
Some men. 

The FDA telegram asks the 
manufacturers to meet with 
the agency "to discuss actions 
your firm will undertake." 

It said the Center for 
Disease Control has learned of 
more than 300 of the cases 
since January, with 28 of them 
ending in death." Although the 
studies identified Rely as the 
tampon most associated with 
TSS, all brands of tampons 
seem also to be associated 
with TSS," it said. 

TV Stars May 
Return to Work 

HOLLYWOOD - Some 
television shows may return to 
production as early as next 
week as striking actors and 
producers moved closer to a 
settlement of the lO-week-old 
strike. 

It is possible that such 
shows as CBS - Archie 
Bunkers Place - WKRP in 
Cincinnati, NBC's Sanford 
and Different Stokes and 
ABC's Barney Miller could 
begin work by Monday. The 
producers, however, had not 
reached a decision on when to 
go back to work. 

West Coast leaders of the 
two performers' unions 
overwhelmingly approved a 
tentative agreement for a new 
three·year contract. The 
western boards of the Screen 
Actors' Guild and the 
American Federation of 
T elevi,;ion and Radio Artists

contract. Union officials were

who walked out soon after the

"We don 't know yet which

it with the union and they have 
to be shows the musicians are

The musicians strike is only 
against filmed programs. 
Taped shows which have an

affected. 

PSA Denies 
Leasing Story 

SAN DIEGO - Strike· 
bound Pacific Southwest 
Airlines denied a report 
yesterday that it may drop its 
commercial operation and 
become only a plane-leasing 
firm, calli g the report "just a 
rumor." 

As directors of the airline 
met during the weekend, a 
spokesman for striking pilots 
said such a move was "a 
distinct possibility," and an 
unidentified company 
spokesman was quoted in one 
published report as saying 
PSA "may become a different 
kind of airline." 

But PSA spokesman Bill 
Hastings, while saying that 
idled jetliners may be leased 
out, denied PSA would stop 
being a commercial airline. 
"No," he said, "it's just a 
rumor. I would doubt an airline 
as successful as this one has 

been and almost certainly will 
be in the future would become 
strictly a leasing operation." 

Anderson On 
Georgia Ballot 

ATLANTA - Indepen. 
dent candidate John 
Anderson's name has been 
placed on Geor~a's official 
ballot form, to be printed 
today, says Secretary of Slate 
Da.vid Poythress. 

But Poythress adds that 
President Carter's home state 
plans to appeal U.S. District 
Judge Newell Edenfield 's 
order that Anderson's name 
appear on the ballot. 

The judge issued an 
injunction against the state 
Friday , saying procedures 
used to disqualify Anderson 
from the ballot deprived him of 
his constitutional right to due 
process of law. Poythress 
disqualified the Illinois 
congressman after ruling that 
about 20 percent of the 
signatures submitted in his 
petihons for inclusion on the 
ballot were invalid. 

If the state wins its appeal to 
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals by Oct. 10 , 
Poythress said there will be 
time for Georgia's countie to 
print ballots without 
Anderson's name. 

Anderson's Georgia 
campaign manager, Kevin 
Zetena, said Edenfield's 
decision would give the local 
campaign a "king-size boos!." 
Carter's campaign director in 
Georgia, Betty Rainwater, 
said the ruling would enhance 
Anderson's position as a 
spoiler. And Lynn McCants, 
director of Republican Ronald 
Reagan ' s presidential 
campaign in Georgia , said, "I 
thought it was pretty fishy not 
to let him on the Georgia ballot 
when he was on all the others." 

The ruling assures that

Sioux Indians 
Stall Decision 

PIERRE,SD - Low 
attendance at a meeting of 
Sioux Indian leaders today 
stalled fo.ooation of a 
committee to study whether 
tribes should accept $105 
million in federal money for 
7.3 million acres of the Black 
Hills. 

The delay threw doubt on 
wheJher tribal councilmen and 
chairmen gathered for a three· 
day meeting will vote on the 
settlement as originally 
planned. 

"There are too few people 
represented at this time to go 
ahead" with formation of the 
committee, said Michael 
Jandreau, chairman of the 
Lower Brule Sioux . 

About 55 Indians showed 
up for the meeting today, not 
all of them tribal officials. 
Organizers had expected as 
many as 500 Sioux would 
attend, About 180 were on 
hand Sunday. 

Jandreau said tribes would 
decide in coming weeks if they 
want to be represented on the 
committee, and then sdect 
represen ta Ii ves. 

A vote on the settlement by 
tribal leaders would serve as a 
recommendation to each of 
the eight tribes involved in the

Dartmouth-UCSD Exchange 
Program Enters Tenth Year 

Many Enjoyed 3,000 Mile "Difference" 
BY JOSH COHEN 

How could anyone in his 
right mind leave the sun, sand 
and surt of San Diego to travel 
over 3,000 miles to a amall 
town in New Hampshire? 

Each quarter, 15 UCSD 
students do ju.t that, packing 
their cold weather gear and 
heading wt for the ivy-
covered hall. of Dartmouth 
College in Hanover, New 
Hampshire. In return, a 
handful of Dartmouth students 
come here, all through the 
UCSD/Dartrnouth academic 
exchange program. 

At firlt glance, thil may 
seem to be a cruel exchange 
for UCSD participantl , 
IOmewhat akin to tran.· 
planting palm trees in the 
Arctic Circle. 

But for the put 10 yea,., 
Iludenta have lUl'Vived thi. 
journey to the east, and the 
fWOgram has never IUHered 
from a lack of applicants. 

Be.ide. the obvioul 
adjustments a San Diegan 
mUit malce in order to IUrvive 
the cool winterl (temperatures 
often drop to a numbing 30 
cieareel below zero), ltudents 

al.o encounter other 
differences. 

Ellen Prahl , a UCSD 
stu~ent who returned to school 
after leaving her studies in 
1968, participated in the' 
exchange last quarter despite 
being discouraged from doing 
SO becaule of her age and sex. 

Prahl describes Dartmouth 
as a "small community where 
people are more personal and 
friendly." Prahl says she was 
very impressed with the 
quantity and the quality of the 
women's pr&grams at 
Dartmouth, a college which 
hal a reputation for 
chauvanism and fraternity· 
domination. 

The "small community" 
atmo.tphere applies not only 
in IOcial 'Iituations, but in the 
dallroom 81 well, UCSD 
participants say. "Clasles are 
conilderably Imaller and 
ltudents get to know their 
professors much better than at 
UCSD," say. Maxine Henry, 
a Muir College Academic 
Advi.or. 

The exchange program is 
open to students who have 
accumulated 60 units and 

have maintained a grade point 
average of 2.5 or better, 
although preference is given to 
students with GPAs above 
3.0. 

Preference is also given to 
Muir students, although 
applications are accepted from 
all colleges. Applications are 
available at the Muir 
Academic Advisor's Office, 
and are due the second week 
of the quarter preceding the 
term the student plans to spend 
at Dartmouth. 

The co.t of this trans-
continen~ trek .. is roughly 
$1,400; U1 addition, UCSD 
registration fees are also 
charged to cover Dartmouth's 
tuition. 

UCSD studentl applying for 
the Dartmouth exchange may 
feel some anxieties about 
lpending a quarter at a school 
that has IUch a high academic 
- and preppy - reputation. 
These fears can all by allayed 
by Nash Ogden, a Dartmouth 
junior, who asserts. "If you go 
back there (Dartmouth), you'll 
see some even wierder looking 
people than here in 
California. " 

Women Reclaim the Night 
continued from pale 1 
all form. of violence against 
women, including an end to 
rape, sexual assault, battery, 
child abuse, incest, porno· 
graphy, and violence on 
televilion, billboards and 
record album covers. 

According to Meliasa 
Bernstrom, spokesperson for 
San Diego Women Take 
Back the Night, "We want to 
make more people aware of 
the extent of violence against 
women and to help them take 
action to prevent it. The march 
and rally will symbolize our 

right to be a part of society, to 
be as free to go about our 
activities as men are, without 
the fear of violent assault. We 
hope all those concerned 
about the violence done to 
women in our society, 
including violence in the 
media, will join the rally." 

Groups endorsing San 
Diego Women Take Back the 
Night include: Big Sister 
League, Inc. , Black 
Federation of San Diego, 
California Campaign for 
Economic Democracy, 
California Feminist Federal 

Credit Union, Catholic

The Dollar was buoyed

Search For Titanic 
continued from pajle 1 

small canyons on either side. The 
area 's active geological activity 
and many formations could easay 
camouflage the Titanic. 

Storms. strong currents and high 
seas hampered the researchers' 
work. The strong currents, for 
example, made towing the sonar 
device at its required slow speed 
difficult. 

The first storm caused the loss of 
the magnetometer. But the quick 
and ingenious thinkin~ of Dr. 
Spiess provided a solution. With 
tile aid of scientists contacted by 
the ship-to-shore phone, Spiess 
fabricated a make· shift 
magnetometer from spare 
electrical parts and coils of wire 
wrapped around a shampoo bottle. 
It worked perfectly. 

More storms and high seas cut 
short the search. Nevertheless, 
important accomplishments were 
made. The wreckage location has 
been narrowed down to a few likely 
sites. Scientific documentation now 
exists for a fascinating area of the 
deep.sea-floor, plus additional 
knowledge of underwater erosion 
processes. 

Plans ha ve been made for 
another voyage in the summer of 

Fred N. Spieu 
1981, when the group of scientists 
hope to finish the task of locating, 
iaminii and salv~ing parts of tile 
Tit'antc. Actually raising the 
Titanic is perhaps technically 
possible but would only be 
financial{y feasible if the ship were 
made of gold.

Three movies are scheduled 

to play on campus this week. 
One is academy award winner 
Annie Hall, which plays at 8 
pm at Mandeville Auditorium 
Saturday, Oct. 4, the day 
after Allen's new movie 
Stardust Memories opens in 
San Diego. 

Another is Breaking Away, 
the cute (did we say that) story 
of a boy and his bicycle, and 
the evil students at the 
University of Indiana who 
oppress the "cutters," or 
residents of the college town in 
which they live. Breaking 
Away will be at Mandeville 
Auditorium, on Friday night, 
at 8 pm. The last is the 
perennially popular Deep 
Throat, whose presentation 
about this time every year nets 
the Rugby Club around 
$2,000. Times are 8, 9:30 
and II tomorrow night; and if 
the show runs true to form, a 
lot of dorm residents will pack 
the house to get a look at wide· 
screen sex, so tickets should be 
plIrchased early.

Bill Fontana 's "sound 
sculpture" continues through 
Oct. 17 on the plaza outside 
the Mandeville Art Gallery. 

Fontana has erected seven 
speakers on the plaza and they 
broadcast from microphones 
placed at Sunny California 
beaches 24 hours a day. 
Screaming voices and birds 
can occasionally be heard, 
and listening to waves move 
from one speaker to the other 
puts Pink Floyd to shame. 

••• 
The B.52s, orginators of 

"Rock Lobster," will play 
Golden Hall next Monday, 
Oct. 6 at 8 pm. 

The show is billed as a 
dance, so all 4 ,000 or so 
tickets are general admission . 
They went on sale yesterday 
morning. Golden Hall is 
downtown, and you ' ll 
probably mix with the opera 
crowd before the show. 

That has happened before.

We lied. There's another 

movie playing on campus this 
week - but it's different from 
the other thrPe, It's Hearts and 
Minds, an unnarrated 
documentary on US involve· 
ment in Vietnam. It won an 
Academy Award and its 
directors were damned 
because they read a telegram 
of congratulations from the 
Hanoi government on 
nationwide TV during their 
acceptance speech. It is 
arguably the best movie about 
Vietnam ever made, and i. 
occasionally quite graphic.

Intramural Football 
Draws Competition 

BY TIM LIOTTA 
Senior Staff Writer 

9 

The first week of any school 
year is always a bit chaotic for 
most students . It means 
standing in endless lines , 
shuffling and reshuffling 
classes and trying to establish 
some sense of order for the 
coming year . There is , 
however, one highlight for the 
student athlete at UCSD 
during this week of turmoil: the 
beginning of another season of 
intramural football. 

searched for that extra edge. 

Every fall football fans long 
for the shrill of an official's 
whistle which pierces the early 
morning sanctity of Muir Field 
each weekend. Since the final 
whistle of last year's Animal 
Bowl, which saw Raw Meat 
win an unprecedented third 
consecutive 1M title, students 
have plotted new tactics, 
recruited new players and 

Although 1M football is the 
third largest intramural aport 
behind basketball and softball, 
the game is played with an 
intensity that isn't found in any 
other 1M competition. Having 
fun, which is the real idea 
behind 1M sports, sometimes 
takes a backseat to winning. 
Vince Lombardi would 've 
been proud if he could ha ve 
seen the program. 

Registration for the fall 
football program took place 
Friday in the Recreation 
offices. As usual, there will be 
three divisions of men's 
leagues and two divisions for 
Coed (AA and A). The 
number of women's divilions 
is still undecided. 

Room has been alated for 
126 teams to compete this fall.

Role of PLO In 
Meetings Debated' 

WASHINGTON (AP) _ 
A compromise was worked 
out last night to prevent a 
disagreement over the denial 
of observer status for the 
Palestine Libertation 
Organization from disrupting 
the annual meeting of the 
International Monetary Fund 
and World Bank. 

President Carter is 
scheduled to address the 
opening of the annual meeting 
today. and an informed source 
said one factor leading to the 
compromise was a desire to 
avoid an acrimonious debate 
that could embarrass the 
president. 

Arab nations, backed by 
other Third World members of 
the organizations. are 
unhappy at successful efforts 
by the United States to deny a 
PLO app~cation for observer 
status at the meetings beret 
However. the source said the 
Arab countries have now 
agreed to voice their 
displeasure in a meeting of the 
organization. joint Procedures 
Committee, which met lut 
~ht. without reaching a 
deCieion, and which will meet 
again thie evening, 

"They have not given up 
their demands, but at the same 
time they will not allow the 
issue to affect the smooth 
operation of the annual 
meeting," said the source, who 
asked not to be quoted by 
name. 

The compromise does not 
foreclose the possibility that 
the Arab countries will 
demand observer status for the 
PLO at future annaul 
meetings, he added. But he 
said a suggestion that the PLO 
representative be seated as an 
observer from the Arab 

League would not be 
acc~table. 

"They are trying to prove 
most of all that the actions in 
keeping the PLO out were 
illegal according to the bl·laws 
of the bank and the IMF." he 
said. 

The United States took the 
lead in the effort to keep the 
PLO out, and .ome Arab 
nations. including Saudia 
Arabia. are underetood to 
have protested that IMF rule. 
were broken in the process. 

The IMF and the bank have 
agreed to investigate these 
alleged irregularities. The 
source said this has the 
purpose of "defusing the issue 
by focueing the argument on 
technical differences, rather 
than emotional ones." 

Book 
Return 

The Central University 
hal installed a new Drive· 
Up Book Depository in its 
east parking lot that will 
enable patrone to return 
books without leaving their 
cars. 

According to Tom 
Sharp, head of the CUL 
circulation department, the 
·depository· should aUeviate 
the problems ~xperienced in 
the past because of limited 
parking. 

Sharp assures library 
users that the depository is 
secure; books drop inside 
the building where they are 
stored until picked up for 
recirculation . .

Iran-Iraq War Update 
Western Bloc To Discuss Oil 
LONDON (AP) -

Britain, West Germany, Italy, 
France and Japan have 
agreed to a US proposal for 
urgent talks on protecting the 
shipment of vital oil IUpplies 
through the Persian Gulf, 
Western diplomats said 
vesterday. 

They said the five Western 
allies advised Washington that 
the security of navigation 
through ~ straits is in their 
vital national interests. 

About half the world 's oil 
supplies pass out of the Gulf 
through the Strait of Hormuz, 
under Iranian control. Japan is 
particularly dependent on oil 
shipped through the gulf. 

Carter last week sent 
personal messages to the 
heads 01 government of the 
five countries offering to 
preside over a meeting to 
examine ways of insuring the 
security of the waterway, 
endangered by the war 
between Iran and Iraq. 

No date has been set for the 
propo.ed meeting, but 
diplomatic sources said the 
United States is expected to 
pro.J)Ole a time next week. 

The United States and its 
allies emphasize nothing 
.hould be done to jeopardize 
attempts by the UN Security 
Council, the Islamic 
conference and others to help 
negotiate an end to the eight-
day border. 

Accordingly, there has been 
tittle public discussion of the 
Carter initiative. 

The major non-communist 
nations, all of which have 

declared neutrality in the 
conflict want to give the 
mediators time to talk to the 
warring oil giants, and they 
want to avoid interfering with 
UN peace efforts. 

Th~y also do not want to 
give the Soviet Union any 
excuse to intervene in the 
crisis. 

Nevertheless, the West has 
taken the first steps to insure a 
continued flow of oil if the war 
threatens guJr shipping. 

About two dozen US 
warships are known to be 
moving toward or into the gulf 
region. A British destroyer 

and a Royal Navy tanker also 
are heading that way. 

The West Germans are 
ready to plug any holes left in 
West European defenses if 
Carter is compelled to move 
America 's Rapid Redeploy-
ment Force into Egypt and 
other points in the area , 
diplomatic sources said. 

They said these precau-
tionary moves certainly are 
being matched by the Soviets , 
probably w i th troop 
concentrations in the Soviet 
republics adjoining Iran and 
Iraq.

From the Auoc:iated Preas 
The United States, while nations other than Iraq and 

reaffirming its neutrality in the Iran has been affected. 
Iraq-Iran war, is considering 
sending planes crammed with 
sensitve listening equipment to 
Saudia Arabia, apparently to 
keep closer track of the war 
between the two Persian Gulf 
enemies. 

President Carter and his top 
foreign policy advisers briefed 
congressional leaders late 

y~terday on what steps the 
US and its allies could take te 
safeguard oil supplies, but no 
decisions were announced. 

Later, however, admini-
stration sources who declined 
to be identified said the 
administration will decide 
whether to send the modified 
707 jets, known' as Airborne 
Warning and Control System 
AWACS planes to Saudi 
Arabia. 

The planes, which have 
sensitive radar and monitoring 
equipment, were last in the 
area in March 1979, when 
they were also in Saudia 
Arabia, officials said. 

Carter and other allied 
leaders have repeatedly said 
the Strait of Hormuz, the 29-
mile-wide passage at the 
bottom of the Persian Gulf, will 
be kept open despite the war. 
About two-thirds of the oil 
used br Western nations flows 
throUgh the strait. 

Thus far, there has been no 
indication that shipping ftom 

In other US developments 
yesterday: 

- Sen. Frank Church, D-
Idaho, the chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, has the United 
States should use its Navy, if 
necessary to keep the Strait 
open. 

Pakistan's prime 
minister, Agha Shahi, met 
with US Secretary of State 
Edmund S. Muskie at the 
United Nations and Shahi said 
later that his nation opposes 
intervention in the Gulf by 
outside powers, including the 
United States. 

Carter's meeting with top 
congressional leaders carne 
amid growing speculation that 
the United States might take 
part in a combined allied naval 
task force to keep open the 
Strait of Hormuz. 

Sens. Jacob K. Javits, R-
NY, and Claiborne Pell, D-RI, 
told reporters at the White 
House after the briefing that 
Carter did not outline what 
action he intends to take. 
America 's allies must take 
part in any such effort, 
however, Javits said. 

The senators did say Carter 
outlined to them the options he 
is considering using and 
sought their comments, but 
they refused to discuss those 
possible plan . 

Huuein Says Iraq Ready for 
Cease Fire 

Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein said in a letter to UN 
Secretary.General Kurt 
Waldheim that Iraq would 
heed a Security Council 
appeal for a cease-fire if Iran 
also would. Hussein urged the 
council to "take necessary 
measures to urge the Iranian 
side to abide" by the resolution 
approved Sunday. Iran did not 
respond immediately to 
Waldheim. 
State Deparbnent Opposes 
Land Seizure 

The State Department said 
yesterday it opposed the 
seizure of territory by force in 
the war between Iran and Iraq. 

At the same time, the 
department called for an 
immediate end to the fighting 
in the sensitive Persian Gulf 
region. 

"We seek, along with other 
nations a ceasefire now," said 
John Cannon, the spokesman. 
"The modalities and the terms 
of that ceasefire would have to 
be, obviously, a matter of 
discussion." 
Life Goes on in Baghdad 

The eight-day-old border 
war with Iran has substantially 
cut oil e»ports and blocked 
Iraq's only sea outlet, but it has 
had little impact on life in the 
Ira9i capital of Baghdad. 

Freshly baked bread is in 
bakeries and the private and 
government-owned stores are 
well stocked with rice and 
meat.
