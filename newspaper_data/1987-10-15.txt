'Mayor, councilmembers discuss issues 
By CINDY CHESY 

Mayor Maureen O'Connor. city council 
members and city officials met with civIC 
and business leaders last week. up for vote 
on the November 3 ballot. to discuss pro-
position (at the fir t-of-its-kind San Diego 
City Council Proposition Forum.) Two of 
the e propositions, if passed . would affect 
transportatlon and land use in the LaJolla-
UCSD area. 

Mayor O'Connor, counc ilper ons Mike 
Gotch . Ed Strulksma and Celia Ballesteros , 
and vanous community leaders spoke out 
on these and other is ues to be offered to 
the voters Nov. 3 In what one reporter 
described as a "pep rally." Each urged 
those present to spread the word on the 
council's position on each of the e mea-
sures. 

"This is the most important election 
since World War II." Mayor O'Connor 
aid , referring to the four new council seats 

to be filled and the measures to be voted 
on . 

"This city has problems and it's only 
going to get worse if we don't sacrifice for 
the next generation'S future," the mayor 

~id. 
Each speaker asked voters to vote for 

those propositions which would increase 
spending in public services in San Diego 
to help alleviate the problems associated 
with an Diego's fast-growing urban sprawl 
and transporation problems. 

Here i a run-down on some of the 
Issues: 

Proposition A: Transportation Sales Tax 
If pas ed. Proposition A will provide for 

a half-cent sales tax increase (raising the 
percent sales tax figure to six and a hall) to 
raise $2.25 billion in transportation im-
provements over the next 20 year . 

Thi money ha been earmarked for. 
among other things. constructing an ex-
tension of Highway 52, from Tierrasanta to 
Highway 67 in antee and for 35 mile of 
trolley tracks.with a line connecting north 
UniverSity City to EI Cajon. downtown an 
Diego. Mi sion Valley and orth Coa<;t. 

Ed Struiksma. in support of the counCII's 
position . said , "If you own a ar and drive. 
vote for this proposition ." 

Susan Taylor, director of Government 
Relations at UCSD. aid . "UCSD is very 
supportive of having trolley service near to 
campus. and if it goes through , the shuttle 
will interface with the trolley to get stu-
dent to various points on campus." 
Propositions Band C: Balboa and Mission 
Bay Park Bonds 

A yes vOt6 on either Proposition B or C 
would allow the city to issue bonds to pre-
serve San Diego landmarks in Balboa Park, 
as well as clean up the sewage on Mission 
Bay; plant grass and build restroom and 
picnic areas on Fiesta Island and portions 
of Mission Bay; and extend a bicycle path 
and walkway from the Catamaran Hotel in 
Pacific Beach to Crown Point Shore . 

These proposition . which are the same 
except that Proposition C calls for $20 
million less than the total bill of$93 million 
for Propo ition B, and therefore, less com-

prehensive . arc being touted by Coun i1-
person Gotch as a "permanent olution to 
the water quality problem and erosion 
problems on Mission Bay." 
Proposition E: Gann Waiver 

If thi propositlon pas e . it will allow 
the CIty to spend revenues collected over 
the next four years/ revenues In excess of 
the amount presently authOrized under 
the Gann Initiative appropriations limit. 
Those services which would benefit include 
police and ft re protection . refuse collec-
tions and disposal. and park and library 
servi es to keep up With an Dlego's popu-
lation growth . 

This excess revenue was attributed to 
the city's unsuccessful efforts to attract 
which resulted in an exees of tourism-
related revenues. Without a special waiver 
from the voters. the monies will be unavail-
able to the city to spend on these services. 
resulting in a decrease in the level of ser-
vice each year to stay within the Gann 
limit. 

If the proposition doe not pass, the 
revenue will be refunded to the voters. "No 
equitable method to return these monies 
has been identified at this time." John 
Lockwood , the city manager for San Diego. 
said. "In moS[ cases. the amount of money 
to be returned to each taxpayer is less than -
$20." 
Proposition f : Renaming Martin Luther 
KingJr. Way 

Passage of Prop. F will change the name 
Martin Luther King Jr. Way to Market 

treet. Business owners located along Mar-

tin Luther King Jr Way are behind the 
proposllion claiming a decrease in busi-
ness since the name was changed by a 
unanimous counCil vote In 1986. 

Mayor O'Connor spoke on behalf of the 
cound against passing the measure. "It's 
hke giVing someone a present and then 
takmg it away." she said . 
Proposition J: La Jolla Valley Project 

A no vote on this proposition would halt 
the urbanization of 5.100 acres of land in 
La Jolla until 1989 or bter. 

If this measure passes, it would mean 
that land in La Jolla deSignated as "urban 
reserve" would be given a "planned urban-
Izing" designation. 

It would "allow any property owner {Q 
develop now." Gotch said, "and creatt: 
helter-skelter. leapfrog development." 

Dave Kreitzer. spokesperson for San 
Diego for Managed Growth , a La Jolla-
based environmental group, supported the 
council's position and said . "This proposi-
tion is asking that raw land be shifted from 
agriculture to urban status. but there is no 
commmunity plan at this time submitted 
by the owners of the land. This would 
provide the owners with zoning and give 
them a free rein . regardless of what the 
general urban plan is for the city of San 
Diego." 

Mayor O·Connor. summing up the gen-
eral sentiments of the council regarding 
these measures. said . "I want to go down as 
being the mayor that wanted to keep the 
quality of an Diego life for the future of 
thiS communlt)'." 

The booming business of books at UCSD 
By ERIC L. VOLLMER 

The role oj a campus boohstnre IS defined III

and on-campus, primarily in the Jorm oj 
Groundwork Boons. Becau e oJthe upcoming 
move to the university center to be completed 
next Jall, both Groundworks and the book tore 
will be undergoing dra tic changes. At this time 
both stores are planningJor their Juture . 

The bookstore must generate the Junds 
needed to make thi.~ move - a move that will 
result m a space double the size oj the present 
operation. Meanwhile, Groundworks struggles 
to mamtain their present lease and questions 
whether the upcdming ccnter will allow Jar 
alternative businesses as theirs.

would like to see in a bookstore. "My ideal 
is the 'Harvard Coop' in Cambridge." he 
said . "Not only is there a mystifying number 
of books to choose from ," he added . "but 
when you use their shop you become a 
member and you belong to a community of

Nobel Prize winner former 
UCSD grad student 

MIT scientist Susumu Tonegawa, who 
won the 1987 Nobel Prite m medici ne, 
was a graduate student at UCSD. He was 
one of the first students in UCSD's twO 
year old graduate biology program when 
he arrived in 1963 from KyOto Univer· 
Slty. He was the eighth student on cam-
pus to recieve a doctorate in biology 

After he earned his doctorate m 1968, 
he went on as a postdoctoral fellow 1rI 
the laboratory of Dr. MasakI HayashI at 
UCSD, and from 1969·70 he was a fellow 
in the laboratory of Dr. Renato Dullbecco 
at the Salk Institute. Tonegawa studIed 
the molecular genetics of a small virus 
that infects bacteria. 

"He was the brightest graduate student 
we ever had ," Hayashi said. "I had great 
confidence he would do something great 
in any field he chose. He was very, very 
bright. He knew what were the most 
important questions to in any field ." 

When asked about his time spent at 
UCSD, Tonegawa said, "The school was 
still very small, and the graduates were 
well taken care of by the faculty. It was 
a great place [0 be." 

His work unlocked the puzzle of how 
genes can change and adapt themselves 
to produce as many as one billion differ-
ent antibodies, each one especially fitted 
to fight a specific infection, the Karo-
hnska Institute said. "This is a basic and 
extermely vital discovery in medIcal 
sCIence," added Prof. Goran Holm of the 
institute .

Smce the discovery more than ft ft), 
years ago that the life span of rats could 
be extended through dietary restriction . 
there has been renewed interests in 
funher exploration of dIetary manipula-
tion on the agi ng process. Yu began work 
in nutritional gerontology 15 years ago, 
using rats to study the aging process 
through dietary restrictions. 

According to Yu, of all the dietary 
manipulation tested so far, calorie restric-
tion is the most powerful intervention in 
extendinig life span and retarding the 
aging process in laboratory animals. 

"Recently, more evidence has accumu-
lated indicating that caloric restriction 
not only exte nds maximum life span but 
also retards many other aging processes, 
such 5 reduced immune system com-
petency," Yu saud. "Laboratory animals 
on a restricted diet show a decrease in 
the appearance of tumors, a reduction of 
kidney problems and an increase in 
phYSical, which is an indication of 
well-being. " 

The UCSD Institute for research on 
Aging promotes research on the detec· 
tion, treatment and prevention of age-
related disorders and on ways to help 
people remain healthy and vigorous into 
their later years. It also sponsors patient 
care programs and programs to educate 
the public about the latest findings in 
aging research .

Physicians get back 
to basics at UCSD 
Medical School 
By ROBERT LEONE 
SlajJWrilu 

UCSD's Institute for Research on 
Aging (IRA) has received nearly $2 
million for phYSician trai ning and 
research funding from the National 
Institute of Heallh's National lnsti-
tute on Aging. 

The IRA, 1 of 2 UC Organized 
Research Units based at the UCSD 
School of Medicine, was approved 
by the Regents in 1983 and is 
directed by Professor). Edwin Seeg-
miller of the School of Medicine. Its 
primary emphasis is biomedical 
research on aging. 

By far the larger of the 2 grants is 
a $1.8 million grant to establish a 
physician-SCientist progrllm, the 
second at UCSD. Two youngphysi-
cians eac h year will be selected 
from a pool of app licants to spend 
5 years in an intensive research 
program. 

According to Seegmiller, this pro-
gram will allow "a young physi-
cian ... back into basic science." 

"The 2 physician-scientists that 
are supported by this new program 
will be entering a laboratory setting 
for 2 years," said Seegmiller, and 
will then spend 3 years "applying 
the new tools they have learned in

Women 517 (reg. $25 ) 
Men 514 (reg. $19) 

clinical research settings." They 

will also learn how to write research 
grant proposals. 

The first 2 particIpants in the 
physician-scientist program have 
already been chosen from a pool of 
6 applicants. They are, Dr. Mark 
Adler, who earned his M.D. from 
Inc University of Pennsylvania, and 
Dr. Candece Gladson , who earned 
her M.D. at Loyola Stritch. 

Adler's field of specialization will 
be oncology (the study of tumors), 
while Gladson will study blood 
clotting, a cause of heart attacks 
and strokes. 

Adler said, "It's an unusual oppor-
tunity for a phYSician interest~d in 
science to get the kind of back-
ground usually afforded to ph. Ds." 
He added that he found his work 
"refreshing, because when you com-
bine it (basic science research) 
with clinical scie nce, you get some-
thing neither alone can provide." 

Gladson. who had a pathology 
residency at UCLA., regards her 
new position as "exciting," and is 
working on the use of molecular 
biology and biochemistry tech -
niques on the mechamsm of blood 
clotting.

grant is for 5 years. It isn 't a 
pennanent endowment because the 
National Institute of Health does 
not extend grants for more than 5 
years. The phYSIcian-scientist pro-
gram at IRA IS I of 2 at UCSD. The 
other, which sta rted in 1985, is for 
the department of medicine. 

The second grant is a Geriatric 
Leadership Academic of approxi-
mately $187,000. It will be the 
initial source of funding for many 
research projects. 

According to Seegmi ller, "One of 
the big needs fo r our whole de-
velopment of new projects is 'seed 
money' to get started on new ideas." 

By using this initial funding (0

Destroying UCSD's symbol: 
new design plans for Central 
Editor: 

The Central Library building has 
been the symbol of our campus for 
the last seventeen years. It is easily 
the most beautiful bUlldingwe have, 
and many think that in its daring 
and bnlliance the architect, Wil-
ham Pereira, created a landmark. 

The basic deSign of the Central 
Library is In danger. The new Cen-
tral Library addition would create 
an earthen wall about 34 feet high 
around the South and West sides 
of the bUilding, thereby destroYIng 
the essential design concept of a 
free floating cube on its corner. 
From the ground level , the pas-
serby would no longer see the 
space that creates that aesthetic 
illusion. 

Under the new design , all you 
would see is an earthen berm lead-
ing up to the middle of a glass 
tower. Moreover, the construction 
of the berm would destroy most of 
the surrounding Eucalyptus grove. 
The proposed new design is by a 
distingUished architect. Gunnar 
Birkerts, and one of his goals was 
to "soften" the Pereira design. Blr-
kens' deSign does create some 
usable space at the "forum" level 
and does have other deSIgn and 
functional merits. but In our OpIn-
ion the new concept is not as good 
as the original one, In part because 
it would obscure and confuse the 
bold design that is the campus' 
symbol. 

Chancellor Atkinson has asked 
Mr. Birkerts to present an alterna-
tive design that would not go above 
the forum level. Based in large part 
on campus opinion . he will have to 
make the deciSion as to which 
design concept Will be used . 

We urge all who are concerned 
about the architecture on campus 
to take a good mental look from the 
ground level at the plans of the 
proposed addition. The plans will 
be located inSide the Library. After-
wards walk around to the West of 
the Library and take a look at what 
would be 1051. Finally. come to an 

open me ..: ting In IliA Chancellor's 
Complex at 10 am on October 22 at 
which Blrkerts' original design and 
an alternative will be presented 
Come and express your views.

withIn a brief moment's time, done 
more damage to the womens' equal-
Ity movement than has Ronald 
Reagan in nearly seven years as 
president. 

Working separalely - though the 
damage tends to be compiled cum-
ulatively - this fiesty foursome has 
contributed much to the perpetu.r-
tion of the negative stereotypes 
that have dogged women since the 
Wicked Eve of Eden fame precipi-
tated the fall of mankind . 

In an interview with reporters , 
Jessica Hahn 's mother referred to 
her lOVing daughter as a real 
"bimbo." While mom is correct for 
chastiSIng sweetJesslca for attempt-
ing to justify her role as a modern-
day Jezebe1 by posing semi-nude 
in a popular "girlie magazine ," it 
appears Ms. Hahn was less pro-
miscuous (the general definition of 
the slang word "bimbo") than she 
was greedy. Reportedly. she earned 
in excess of $1 million for display-

An open letter to Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor: 

On behalf of the San Diego 
Young Americans for Freedom, I 
am quile disturbed by th.:- events of 
last Wednesday, Oct. 7, in which 
your office presented a symbolic 
"key (Q the CllY" to Soviet 'Journal -
ist" Vladimir Posner 

Although I do not deny Mr 
Posner's right of free speech , which 
he exen:lsed so eloquently before 
both the City crub and a UCSD 

rowd on that day, it should be 
noted that he represents a govern-
ment that most often times re -
pres es that same right ThiS should 
have been taken into account prior 

to your omce imposing upon the 
citizens of San Diego the responsi-
blhty for thi s "gesture of goodwill ," 
with which many of them are quite 
appalled . 

Lines ul communication between 
our government and the govern-
ment of the Soviet Union should 
remain open - that can not be 
denied -but I would urge one 
thing. Gestures of goodwill made to 
political propaga ndists like Posner 
should be conditional, such as at 
the time his government makes a 
Similar gesture (Q the thousand of

he has disagreed with the Soviets

questions remained regardi ng 
Posner's true colors prior w last

not be denied

UCSD gets latest in call boxes 
ByJOHN SHAW 
Trai"l"g Direcfor 

In an effort to increase campus 
security, UCSD police have invested 
ove r $3 1,000 in a new emergency call-
box system that has attracted atten-
tion from uni versi ties across the statc. 

According to UCSD Police Cri me 
Prevention Officer AI jenkins, UCSD 
IS the first ulllversity in California to 
have installed thc wireless Motorola 
two-way radio call -box system. 

"I've been gelling a lot of calls from 
other ca mpuses to see how we like it. 
San Diego State, UC DaVIS, and UC 
anta Barbara have called wanting 

information about the system. UC 
Rive rside Just purchased It and UC 
Irvmc is looking at it," jenkins said. 

Campuses are interested in the 
WIreless system because of ItS ad-
va ntages over older systems that re-
quire the d igglllg of trenches and wir-
IIlg ove r long distances . Seven of 
UCSD's 14 call-boxes are part of a 
hard-wired system. The other 7 a re 
part of the more economical Motorola 
system installed in ea rly September. 

"Trenchlllg and hard-wiring was 
cost prohibitive. With the uni ver ity 
growlllg so much, we had to pick a 
syslem that would expand along with 
the ca mpus. In the past , If the univer-
si ty decided to construct a new build-
mg or parking lot where there was a 
call -box , we had to relocate It and 
rewire it," Jenkins sa id 

Since the new system is wireless , 
the boxes ca n be relocated cheaply 
and easily. ExpanSIOn is as easy as 
mounting the ~3,300 box to a light 
pole. 

NO[ only are the new call boxes easy 
to II1stall , they are easy to use . The 
radio IS activa ted when the ca ll-box 
door is opened . A UCSD police dis-
patcher Will respond by a~king if you 
need assistance . To talk, simply press 
the red button. When through , close 
the door. You need not tell the dis-
patcher where you are because the 
system autOmatically inform~ the po-
lice of your location. 

The ca ll-boxes also have .1 fealUre 
that noones the poli e if the unit is 
be ing tampered wi th or if the batteries 
are going dead . One of the new call-

boxes has already malfunctioned. After 
several unsuccessful attempts to repair 
a unit in the new Third College park-
1I1g lots , UCSD police were forced to 
return the radio to MotOrola. 

According to jenkins, some stu-
dents and staff are unclear as to when 
rhey can use the call boxes. 

"BaSically we wa nt them used for 
eme rgenc ies, but if It'S late at night 
and you r car doesn't Start o r you need 
a CSO, by all means use it I JUSI don't 
want people using it like a telephone 
to ask things like , 'What time can I get 

~ bike registered}' ," jenk1l1s said . 
9["0 make thlllgs more c1ear,Jenkins 
replaced the Slickers on thc call boxes 
that read "For Emergency Use Only" 
With new ones that say "UC Police 
ASSistance '. 

"We have to make the policy I for 
ca ll -box u e I more liberal. because the 
university IS getting so big. I don 't 
want to make someone walk a mile to 
get to a telephone ," jenk1l1s ~ald 

JenklllS said he recently submitted 
a proposal to 1I1stallli more ca ll boxes 
on campu~ , 2 of which would be 
placed on and near the par course. ~

After the alcohol p-olicy_ 

Resident deans discuss effects of dry campus 
By lEESA LIGHT 

T HE alcohol polt )' has long been :l subJe t of lmtroversy at UCSD. Thl year. however, 
it IS less so. primarily due to changes 
in hOUSing, which have drastically 
affected the al ohol pohcy enforce-
ment 

Private space is de-
fined by the univer-
sity as a dorm room 
or an apartment with 
a closed door . 

This year, prlom)/ was given to 
first and second year students wi th 
upperclassmen filling any remair-
mgspaces Since the al ohol policy 
was changed in 1985 by the vice 
chancellor of undergraduate Affairs , 
Joseph Watson, the students now

administrative stance on alcohol 
onsumptlon and thus h.ld morc 

problems with the new cnforce-
ment of the pobcy. UCSD has 
adopted the state law as the gUlde-
hne for alcohol consumption on 
campus. ThiS means that no one 
under 21 can buy. possess or sell 
alcohol on or "rr campus. 

If anyone b'l11g on campus is 
over 21. they must consume alco-
hol beverages in their "p rivate 
space." 
Private space is defi ned hy the un i-
versllY as a dorm room or an 
apartment wllh a closed door. Alco-
hol on a private balcony. patio or 
sUlle is considered a violation of 
policy and students wtll be cited 
for drinking in these places. 

Pat Danylyshyn-Adams, Muir 
College resident dean, lakes what 
she refers to as an "educational ap-
proach" to alcohol in the dorms 
and apartments. If an HA notice,S 
that a tudent docs have a problem 
with alcohol thelt goes beyond dts-
ciplinary measures. Danylyshyn-
Adams helps the student receive

Book buying politics 
Continued from page J 

Dr. Leonard Newmark, profes-
sor of linguistics and chairman of 
UCSD's Bookstore Advisory Com-
mittee, casts a different light on the 
venture. ·Our bookstore's changed 
enormously si nce its humble begin-
nings, from amateur run to highly 
professional. It's one of the fastest 
growing stores in the country .. . 
probably the fastest with the new 
expanded quarters expected in 
1989. By and large , the present 
bookstore serves its public well. 
Sure, there are 'glitches' sometimes, 
but most people get most of thei r 
books most of the time. Some 
departments seem to have had a 
run of bad luck. The communica-
tions department. of course, has 
switched to Groundworks to fill 
their class orders. Our faculty 
should Stop in now. It's a different 
bookstore." 

Instead of 25,000 titles , the book-

store currently stocks about 40,000, 
and the new bookstore at [he Uni -
versity Center is expected to dou-
ble the prf>sent inventory. New-
mark added "Our bookstore has 
responded to its community in a 
way that some departments don't 
like. If you're in literature, you're 
qUick to observe that the bookslOre 
has not responded to a literary 
community. It features a wonderful 
selection of Technical Works and 
has the best medical section a-
round. One thing that has sur-
prised and delighted us all is that 
the new literature section has en-
joyed enormous success this past 
year. There is a readership here , 
after all . A great bookstore does 
respond ." 

As one of the origll1al professors 
at UCSD, Newmark has watched 
the university grow, and takes a 
ce rtain amount of pride in the 
impetus on campus to make this 

one of the greatest.academic insti-
tutions in the state, and perhaps . 
the country. His final comments 
about the design of the new book-
store makes such a plan assume an 
aura of destiny. Thts is no longer 
just a bookstore , nor JUSt another 
university. but something more akin 
to "promised land ." 

A visit with Vtce Chancellor Ste-
phen Relyea does nothing to dim-
inish this image. In fact , he enhan-
ces it. "UCSD is one of the premier 
teaching research institutes in the 
United States So what Paul Mares 
(manager of general books), Laura 
Long, and I did was to examine 
bookstores at UCLA, Berkeley. and 
Stanford , looking fora model of the 
kind of store we felt would be most 
appropriate here . We invited the 
Stanford BOOKstore management 
to UCSD where they made a tho-
rough re-appraisal of our main 
campus bookstore in Building 201 
anci presented their recommenda-
tions."

are often the last refuge for books 

nor dominated by co mmercial, 
chain bookstores, In this sense, the 
campus bookstore fills the role of 
something like a games reserve for 
endangered book titles which have 
been doomeu by a too- mall read-

I mproved bookstore will be a UI1l -
ve rslty howcase to the community 
at large and will also fos ter an 
Im pressive image of UCSD to cor-

In COntrOl5t to the high ambitions 
of the university bookstore IS the 
Groundwork Booksto re , one of 
UCSD's man}' co-ops, ThiS store 
se rves as an alte rnative to the 
mainstream and h,lS recently had a

Groundworks is reminisce nt of the 
small. independe nt bookstores that 
have vanished in the wake of the 
shopp ing mall chain sto res, like 
Crown and Walden Books, The 
customers at Grou ndworks seem 
like members of that rare breed of 
people who still read books fo r 
pleasure , rather than only for 
classes, 

S.R. , a Grou ndworks member, 
and as different from Paul M3res as

at an outdoor table , surrounded by 

~tac ks of boo k oders and receiptS , 
he recalled , "T he Groundwork

"Besides remaining a source for

to deve lop a theory and practice of

Tritons mug New York 
Volleyball 
beats Cortland 
State, 3-1 

By MATT STEUERWAL T 
Staff Wrlrrr 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team showed why they are the 
lass of Division 111 Wednesday 

night . After pounding some poor 
competition over the weekend , the 
Tnton's found Cortland (N.Y.) State 
a tougher challt>nge. 

San Diego got the first point of 
the first game, but neither team 
could find their passing, and the 
game stalled at 3-3. Then the Trit-
ons began to put it together as they 
ran off three straight points, gOt a 
side out, and three more quick 
points for a sudden 9~3 k .td. Cort-
land State took timeout to try and 
break the rhythm of the game. 
However, Diane Klintworth and 
Dee Dee Bigelow didn't seem to 
mind; they served the game for a 
surprising easy UCSD 15-3 win. Bryan Bilyeu/Guardian Ellen Chi (#2) goes up for the block. 

The crowd seemed reSigned to 
another Tnton blowo~t , but Cort -
land State wasn't, They spotted San 
DIego the first point of game two, 
then got the next four 

UCSD evened the score , taking 
four of t he next five poi nts for a 5- 5 
tie The Red Dragons won another 

four of five and had a 9-6 ·Iead. 
which they quickly extended to 
12-6. It was then the Trition's turn 
to take timeout. Ellen Chi finally 
got them some pOintS and the gap 
closed to 12-9. Cortland State coun-
tered with twO more before a bad 

serve gOt San Diego a sideout and a

Right-hand man 
By KAREN KUMM 
Staff Wrltrr 

Earl Edwards is the first person to hold the full-time position of 
assistant athletic director here at UCSD. Until epr. 1 of this year, 
the position was always held by at least one part-time individual. 

Apparently UCSD has chosen to expand in ways other than the 
construction of new buildings. New full-time positions have been 
filled at Canyonview athletics, including Bill Gannon, sPOrts infor-
mation director and Edwards as assistant athletic director. 

A newcomer to Southern California, Edwards has come to UCSD 
from Drexel University in Philadelphia. He worked at Drexel for six 
years as a professor of physical education and as assistant athletic 
director. 

Along with his work at Drexel, Edwards has worked at the 
University of Michigan as director of intramurals, at UC Davis as 
a~sociat(, directOr of intramurals, and at the University of Massa-
chusetts as assistant director of intramurals. Edwards received a 
Master uf Science and Sports Administration at U. Massi Amherst. 

Last spring, Edwards responded to an ad in the NCAA News 
Chror.iclr that described a new, full-time position avaIlable at 
UCSD Interviewed over the telephone, Edwards impressed the 
athletic department enough to receive an invitation for a second 
interview, this time in person. 

He is excited about his new position because of the increased 
responsibilities it entails and "because of the national reputation of 
the school, academically and athletically," he said. 

Edwards is also pleased to be working with Judy Sweet, our 
athletic· director. Sweet is nationally acclaimed in the NCAA and is 
involved in numerous committees for division III, he said. 

Edwards is pleased with UCSD's achievements. "I like the philo-
sophy in division III ," he said, "dealing with the student as a first, 
and as an athlete. second ." 

Edwards would be satisfied with any division of the NCAA, "as 
k)ng as it's quality work." he said. He added that a move up in 
dIvision would have to be instigated by the students and adminis-
tration , rather than the athletic department. 

Edwards' feelings arc similar concerning the possibility of a 
football team here. He would suppOrt it, but, again , feels that the 
process must start from the students and go to the adminstration. 
The suppOrt has to be financial as well as emotional.

"The money issue has to be 
addressed ," he said regarding a 
UCSD football team. "Money issues 
arc sensitive issues," he added . 

Edwards divides his posaion as 
assistant athletic director into four 
areas of responsibility: home game 
management , supervision of 6 in-
tercollegiate SpOrts (this fall) , fund -
raising coordinator for all the teams 
and overseeing of total progra~ 
operations. When Judy Sweet is 
away on conference, whi h is fre-
quent , Edwards will take over all 
her resp nsibilities. 

Edwards is also part of the plan-
ning comminee for the new athletic 
and recreation facility and playing 
fields that will be built near the 
Supercomputer. He finds it exciting 
to have arrived in the midst of 
many new developments. 

"I t is obvious that the University 
is making more of a commitment 
to the athletiC program," he said. 
"The University is ready to explode, 
you could say." 

He feels that the new University 
Center will help unify the students 
and thus increase support for ath-
letic programs. At present, the 
school is "still so uivisive, which 
explains the separation among stu-
dents and the lack of support: he 
said. 

Edwards has just arrived from 
the east coast with his fiancee'. He 

began his position as assistant 
athletic director Sepr. l. 

''I'm happy to be here; I love the 
area, the nature of the job and the 
attitude of the athletes, " he 
said. ~ 

Edwards divides his position as 
assistant athletic director into 
four different areas of responsi-
bility: home game management, 
supervision of 6 intercollegiale 
sports (this fall), fund-raising co-
ordinator for all of the teams, 
and overseeing of total program 
operations.

Yorkers. Cortland State then took 
the longest and most exciti ng game 
of the match on the next serve. The 
game ended 15-10, and the match 
was even 1- 1. 

The # 1 ranked Triton's hJ.d nOt 
lost a game in a long time (never 
mind how long since they lost a 
match) , so they were pretty fired 
up when the teams took the court 
for game three . They Jumped out 
for a 4-0 lead before Cortland State 
even got to serve. Then the teams 
traded points, with neither team 
making a big run, unlll the score 
was 9-5. 

Cortland got the next two POIntS, 
setting the stage for what was easily 
the most eXCiting pOint for the 
whole match and probably the 
most Important. 

The rally on the Single point 
seemed to last almost five minutes 
as both teams were hilling the floor 
and scrambling for the ball , like 
they realized this was the focal 
point of the match . If Cortland 
State had won ,. the score would 
have been only 9-5 (UCSD's favor) 
and they would have had a chance 
to tie. Instead , the rally died on a 
double-hit by Cortland serrer Kel-
lie Carey, and UCSD was in control 
of the serve and the game . The 
score was 10-7; then 11-5 before 
the first Cortland State timeout. 
After Carol Lipson served to 13-8, 
the Red Dragons took another time-
out. It took two more sideout's until 
UCSD served the winning point. 
They won the third game 15-5, and 
had a 2-1 lead in the match .

SPORTS 

Senior all -American Carol Lipson (116) and junior Dee Bigelow 
(1110) show what put UCSD in the number one spot. 

For the fourth time in four games, 
San Diego took the first point. Cort-
land State took the next two, but 
UCSD got two out of three as the 
game see-sawed to 4-3. 

Despite yelling on every play, 
the Cortland State fans could not 
help their team overcome Lipson's 
great play in this game. She served 
three points for a 7-4 San Diego 
lead, then made three digs in one 
rally to win back the serve. 

The score was 9-6 when Dee 

Dee-Bigelow found her serve again 
and pulled the Triton's to a 11-6 
lead . All Cortland State's timeout 
did was delay the inevitable as 
UCSD got a kill for point # 12, an 
ace for #13, another kill for #14, 
and blocked a hit to take a game for 
15-6, and the match 3-1. 

With the win , the top-ranked 
Triton's ran their record to 17-1. 
The 13th ranked Red Dragons have 
only a long plane ride to show for 
their trip out west. ~

Michelle, I love you. Your the most 
important person in my life. Nothing can 
come between us except perhaps my 
occasional stupidity. Not Jin's feelings, not 
Ray and not volleyball. I've made mistakes

average age of the team is 27 and his workout 
schedule Isn 't dOing anyth: ~g to get hiS troops In 
shape. Henry Chang and Robert Vacheron are 
fielding a team that has been knocking at the 
door recently, and figures to be the bridesma id 
one more time. The young upstarts are led by las t 
year 'S AA c hamps SQUELCH SKAZAM. Captatn 
Pregerson has been fine tuning his squad all

the AA to the AAA cham pionship. Pabto Navarro

No Scabs AUowed 
Unlike the NFL. at UCSD crowds are up. there 

are no picketers and the play IS tremendous on 
the fields t wonder If the union NFLers are play -
ing for any 1M football teams 

Take our AAA football for example. I've ne ve r 
seen such s ize. the average lineman wljl ghs In a t 
about 220 pounds That's a lot of beef One 
example IS firs t-year med student John Bergen 
wh o plays With STRYCHINE. John IS no little guy 
He weighs In at about 250 and IS 6'5" tall He also 
pla yed some football outS ide UCSD In the pas t . 
like with the Seattle Seahawks. Another awe-
some lineman IS Rob '1 WOUldn 't talk about my 
weird hair if I were you' Hlnke_ If you get past the 
eccentnc Brian Bosworthtess hairdo you Will lind 
the fastest. meanest dude who has ever lined up 
in the pits. 

But he has trouble keeping up with some of the 
top s peed merchants at the big ·U·. Take 'fa s l' 
Eddie Taell rom Phi Delta Theta. He 's a jewel to 
watch . The n there 's Mr. 1M himself Doug Roche 
who pta ys for perennially tough YORK HUNT 
CLUB. Probably the most dan gerous tr iple threa t 
in 1M footba ll. He can pass . run and catch with 
equal talent . Probably the sWiftest of the SWift is 
Parenthesis Devers of CHOCOLATE CITY. The 
only f 00 mete r man to break 10 flat In school 
history te lls you how fast he is. Oua rterback Is the 
glamour position and we sure have some glam-
ourous guys who can fling il. Take the prototype 
NFL QB and we have one. HIS name is Doug 
Stanley and he plays for the YOUNG THUNDER-
ING HERO. Tall. with a cannon for an arm this 
guy may end up in the NFl. Another great 
thrower is Frank Vernon from the EVIL EMPIRE. 
Frank is about as old as Mathousla but he's got a 
great arm and uses It we ll. 

It looks like It will be a great season all the way 
up to the Animal Bowl is November to deCide the 
cha mpion here at UCSD. Look for York Hunt 
Club vs . Chocolate City In the fi nal. lI 's too early 
for even myself to pick a winner fo r that game

Congratulations a re in o rder for t~ first Bud Light Team of the week for 

1987-19B8, Choco'" City. They earned the title Saturday when they 
defeated BEAKERS FEAKERS by a score of 20-14. 

Chocolate City has been a traditional powerhouse in AM Men's Football 
for J 5 years. This makes them the longest standing team in UCSO Intramural 
history. This year's team is led by Captain/Quarterback Marlon Fairweather 
and running back Parenthesis (PO) Devers, whose speed makes up for his 
lack of receiving skills. (Sorry, Remmell) 

This team has always been the best dressed, which was their only 
downfall in the game this week - their uniforms weren't quite in tactl Have 
no fear , though, Marlon plans to have that under control by next week 's 
game. 

Good luck throughout the Intramural year UCSO - This Bud Light's

PLA '{ING AROUND WITH PLA ,{GROUND SLAP 
by m ike e . d u ncan 

N e ver having b e en the type 
o f band to follow trends, the 
Playground Slap has developed 
a style that is e xtremely diffi-
cult to categorize . It's a fresh , 
funky sort of pop that has t he 
power to reach right down 
through your spinal cord and 
make you dance . The P lay-
ground Slap is playing at the 
Triton Pub tomor row a t 4:30. 
You definitely don't want to 
miss this one - t h ese guys are 
hot! 

Seasoned veter ans of the 
local m usic sce n e, the P lay-
ground Slap have become on 
of the most popular, and well-
respected bands in San Diego. 
All you have to do is see them 
once to understand why this is 
so. "Our real strength is in our 
live shows," Marc elo Radulo-

by john kearney 

hi. l U I Itaff writer 

Although his name is not 
yet a household word, Allan 
Holdsworth has been hailed 
by the likes of Eddie Van 
Halen, Carlos Santana, and 
Gary Moore, as the best gui-
tarist around. Holdsworth 
sometimes finds it difficult to 
live up to suc h expectations, 
but he reac ts to the praise o f 
his ability and s tyle with grace-
ful humility . 

"I'm just looking fo r a w ay

In the ea rly ' 70s, Holds-

moved to London where he

Addis said , " because they 
wanted to turn us into some-
thing we ' r e not. What' s the 
use in b e ing a musician if you 
can't fo ilow your muse? A lot 
o f the stuff on the radio is 
there because it sounds like 
last week 's hit . We ' re not like 
that ; we find our own direc-
tions. People like us because 
we' r e so differen t ." 

" We don't m ean to be dif-

guitarist added, "but signing 
with a record compa n y is like 
getting married . It's got to be 
right or you' r e really gonna 
regret it later. We don ' t mind 
waiting, we're patien t." 

These guys a r e an a m azing

the nicest guys you'll ever

AN EVENING WITH 

A seductive show 
by nigel Iindemann 

hiatus staff writer 

San Diego Opera opened its 
23rd season Saturday at the 
civic Theatre with a rousing 
performance of Verdi's pow-
erwerful tragedy "Rigoletto." 
Playing to a near-capacity 
crowd on the annive rsary of 
the composer's birth, English 
bari tone John Rawnsley and 
Korean soprano Hei-Kyung 
Hong delivered masterful per-
fo rmances in the lead roles of-
Rigoletto and Gilda, and Ar-
gentine tenor Diego d' Auria 
succes fully replace the ailing 
Taro Ichihara as the Duke of-
Mantua. 

Saturday's performance 
marked the San Diego Opera 
debut for Rawnsley , who 
launched his international 
ca reer in the role of Rigoletto 
hr the English National 
Opera. One bestselling re-
cording and several years later, 
Mr. Raw nsley's sonorous re-
pertoire has grown to include 
Marcello in "La Boheme," 
Tonio in "I Pagliacci," Enrico 

in " Lucia di Lammermoor" 
and Ezio in "Attila." 

Returning for the 1987-88 
season is Hei-Kyung Hong, 
who made her San Diego debut 
in 1985 as Mimi in "La 
Boheme." A 1982 graduate of 
the Julliard School , Hong ap-
pears regularly at the Metro-
politan Opera and has mas-
tered such diverse roles as a 
Russian-language production 
of "Eugene Onegin" and Sin-
opoli's "Lou Salome Suite." 

Also making his San Diego 
Opera debut is Argentinian-
born Diego d' Auria, who sings 
the role of the uke of Man-
tua . Mr. d'Auria, is now an 
Italian citizen, received his 
training at the Conservatorio 
de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires 
and later in Frankfurt. He has 
capta ined such roles as the 
leads of La Traviata, I Puritani 
and The Elixir of Love. 

The story of Rigollete has 
its origins in a play by Victor 
Hugo, "Le Roi s'amuse," 
about a hunchbacked court 
jester whose mockery pro-
vokes a noblemen's curse. As 

the opera opens, the noble-
men (Count Mo nterone) des-
cends upon the Court of Man-
tua to denounce the duke s 
Boss) for dishonor'ing his 
daughter. Rigoletto finds the 
situation funny at the time, 
but doesn't think it's very 
funny when the duke seduces 
his own daughter (Gilda), and 
Rigoletto with the help of the 
assassin Sparafucile conspires 
to kill the promiscuous mas-
ter. However, Gilda has fallen 
in love with the duke and sac-
rifices her own life to save his . 
Thus, the prophecy is fulfilled. 

"Rigoletto" is one of the 
world's greatest operas and 
has been delighting audiences 
since its premiere in 185'1. It 
contains some of opera's most 
memorable and enchanting 
music; including the tenor aria 
"La donna e mobile" and the 
sopra no loveso ng "Caro 
noem." The San Diego Opera 
will offer two other perfor-
mances of the work - Friday, 
October 16th at 8 p.m. and 
Sunday, October 18 at 2 p.m.

An adult fairy tale

hiarul ItaEE writer 

Rob Reiner is at it again . 
After his sleeper hit "Stand By 
Me" of 1986, Reiner has 
brought together an impres-
sive cast to help him with 
"The Princess Bride." Full of 
cameo appearances - from 
Billy Crystal and Carol Kane 
to the English comic, Mel 
Smith - "The Princess Bride" 
is an off-beat comedy adven-
ture which is full of surprises 
and laughs. 

Written by two-time Aca-

dance Kid" and" All the Presi-
dent's Men"), "The Princess

Moving parts, multi-tlimen-
sions, texture, and bright 
colors are all part of the 
paintings and contructions 
showing this week at th~ 
Mandeville Annex Gallery 
from 12-5 pm daily through 
Friday, 

The works exhibited are 
by UCSD undergraduate 
artists Chris "Bm" Jennings 
and Cynthia Moore. Jen-
nings described his work as 
"illusionistic two-dimen-
sional paintings dealing with 
the problems of painting on 
a two-dimensional surface 
th e t h ree -d i m e ns io nal 
world." 

Although Jennings does 
not focus on any exact sub-
ject, there is an undercur-
rent relating the pieces of 

beautiful woman in the 
world ," and W estley, in the 
fairy-tale kingdom of Florin. 
This tale is told to a grandson 
by his grandfather. Westley, 
intent on marrying Buttercup, 
strikes out to earn enough 
money for the couple to live 
comfortably . 

Five years later , Westley 
has still not returned and is 
presumed dead . Buttercup is 
then chosen to become the 
princess bride of Prince Hum-
perdinck. Matters are compli-
cated further still by the kid-
napping of Buttercup and the 
unexpected return of Westley. 

The casting in "The Prin-
cess Bride" is superb. Fred 
Savage plays the enthralled 
grandson and Peter Falk is the 
story-telling grandfather. Al-
though the two play minor 

this show. " l'w chosen to 
nail them directly to the 
wall without any frames 
surrounding them." 

Moor e portrays h e r 
words as " Human Spaces." 
She is working o n five 
paintings that have human 
qualities and address fami-
lies. " Members of a family 
usually take a space." A 
painting called " Family 
Joke" has spinners which 
are touched by the viewer, 
There is a resemblance to 
the child's 'Busy Box.' 

" Residue of Dreams" is 

roles, both are wonderful. 
The band of kid nappers is 
brillantly made up of the 
unlikely trio of actor / playw-
right Wallace Shawn ("Man-
hattan" and "My Dinner with 
Andre"). Tony Award-win-
ning Mandy Patinkin ("Rag-
time" and "Yentl") and 6 '5", 
525-pound professional wrest-
ler Andre the Giant. The mis-
adventures of this trio are the 
primary source of comedy in 
the movie and they are hilar-
ious. Billy Crystal is also funny 
as Miracle Max, a jaded wizard . 

It is screenwriter Goldman's 
dialogue that truly makes "The 
Princess Bride" work . His style 
of using modern language for 
such fanciful cha racters gives 
the movie an off-beat and often 
sarcastic flavor. The film is 
full of purposely awkward 

ano ther painting which 
Moore says takes a shape. 
" It is a headboard into 
which your dreams ar 
deposited. It takes a physi-
ca l aspect." 

Although the Annex Gal-
lery is usually used by 
graduate students, some-
times undergraduates are 
allowed to share the space. 
Moore explai ned that it is 
desirable for an undergrad-
uate to go through the pro-
cess of showing their work 
and receiving feedback from 
students and faculty.

Next are the Tar Babies. 
O ne of the freshest and most 
explo ive band to come out 
of the Madison hard ore scene 
alive. The Tar Babies promise 
nothi ng , b ut deliver a lot . 
Having been described as a 
crossbreed of the Butthole Sur-
fers, Die Kreuzen and Throb-
bing Gristle, the Tar Babies 
are not just another punk rock 
band. W ith songs like "Spir-
itual Forklift," the Tar Babies 
are ju t like their album over-

verwhelming.

Mythic Journey 
by kevin adam 

"The Imag of th proml ed 
land ha ab olutely nothing to 
do With real tate." 

Th se ar the rds f Jo-
seph Campbell, answenng the 
claim of fundamentali ts and 
other historical reali t that all 
the grand tale f the Bible are 
real and have a place in time. 
Little gems like this quote 
abound in the one-hour docu-
umentary, II A Hero'sJourney," 
which is a glimpse at the life 
and ideas of mythologist Jo-
seph Campbell. 

Joseph Campbell, now in 
his 80s, is one of the rare 
renaissance men of this cen-
tury. His interest in mythol-
ogy started as a teenager with 
an obsession for Indian lore . 
While other 17 -year-olds mar-
velled at the gun-slinging of 
Buffalo Bill, Campbell was 
nurturing a compassion for 
the plight of the native Amer-
ican. That compassion led him 
to the conclusion that their 
myths are an attempt to come 
to terms with the harshness of 
their lives. 

As a young man, Campbell 
traveled to Europe where a 
chance meeting with the philo-
opher Krishnamurti sparked 

his interest in the eastern reli-
gions. On the same trip, the 
mythologist was struck by the 
art of Picasso, Matisse, Bra-
cussi and other artists of that 
era in Paris . In them he aw 
common mytho logica l e1e~ 
ment which he later in or-
porated into his books. 

Perhap the be t equen e 
are tho e of Ca mpbell peak-
Ing ca ually with his students 
at Sarah Lawren e Colleg >, 
where he was on the faculty 
(rom 1934 to 1972. Her " 

ampb·1I the storyteller is 
brought out in a way that n 
a 'adcmic text on myth logy 
could achieve. His language is 
so beautifully simple, that 
these on the psy hological 
stat's of men o rne across like 
a bedtime story told by grand-
pa-full of mature incerity 
and wit. 

"In ancient times , the In-
dians would drive buffal 
herds off liff," Campbell 
ay , a he outli nes an Indian 

tale to a gatheri ng of student . 
Continuing , he say, "But one 
year, the buffalo will not run 
over the cliff, and so, in fear 
that her tribe will starve , a 
young quaw makes a desper-
ate promise to marry the buf-
falo that will lead the herd 
over the cliff. Well , next thing 
you know, down come the 
buffalo from the cliff above. 
And sure enough, one buffalo 
walks over and takes the squaw 
by the arm." 

Unobtrusive is the only way 
to describe the camera work 
of director David Kenard and 
others. In the story-telling 
scenes, like the one above, 
Kenard chooses to let the 
camera and the audience focus 
on Campbell's words rather 
than the reactions of his lis-
teners. 

Like good interviewers, 
good documentaries let their 
subjects do the talking, and 
this is what It A Hero's Jour-
ney" does best. Whenever 
Campbell speaks on screen, 
whether he is in his office, on a 
park bench or speaking at a 
dinner, he is clearly speaking 
to an audience rather than an 
interviewer. It is a rare docu-
mentary that edits footage so 
well that the speaker and his 
ideas are all that is showcased. 

When Campbell is not on 
s reen, the movie doe a hand-
o rne job of depicting the 

power and endurance the e 
my ths have v r o ur live . 
Ml 'helangelo's viSIOn of (' 
and man ar juxtapo ed WI 
dep i tions ot Buddha, ea<... 
tirring feelings ot ompHssion 

and hope. Hmpbell describe 
the common ground between 
eastern and western myths as 
"A transcendent energy among 
all beings." That energy seems 
refle ted In ampbell, and is 
thoughtfully captured in " A 
Hero's Journey."
