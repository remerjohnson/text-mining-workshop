Jenn Pae elected A.S. president 
Independent candidate wins by 644 votes 

By VLADlMII KOGAN 
Senior Staff \\\iter 

In a runoff election that exceed-
ed turnout expectations, voters 
picked independent candidate Jenn 
Pae over Students First! candidate 
Harish Nandagopal as the next A.S. 
president by a larger than three to 
two margin. 

With 58 voters absuining, Pae 
toole in 1,691 votes to Nandagopal's 
1,047. 

"I'm proud of the campaign I 
ran, I'm proud of my slate. and 
I'm proud of my values," 
Nandagopal said at Round Table 
Pizza, where elections officials 
announced the results on April 9. 

Students First! candidates won 
a11 other vice president and cabinet 
positions except for commissioner 
of athletic affairs. 

Nandagopal said that despite his 
own defeat, this year's election was 
a success for his progressive slate in 
what he called a campus dominated 
by conservative voters and "spine-
less liberals." 

Pae said that though she ran 
independently, she nevertheless 
received a lot of support in her 
campaign. 

"There is no way I could have 
done this by myself," Pae said. "It's 
just been a matter of people wanti-

and without them I wouldn't have

Steven Adler 
Appointed new 

Earl Warren 
College provost 

ment since 1987 and currently 
serves as the department's vice 
chair. During his tenure at UCSD, 
he has served on a variety of uni-
versity committees, including the 
advisory committee on undergrad-
uate education and the committee 
on educational policy. 

"Professor Adler's leadership 
and extraordinary committnent to 
undergraduate education will make 
a real difference at Warren 
College," said Acting Chancellor 
Marsha A. Chandler in an April 8 
statement. "I am enormously' 

\ 

pleased that someone with Steve's 
outstanding qualifications and aca-
demic record has accepted this 
important position." 

Adler will replace current 
Warren Provost David K. Jordan, 
a professor of anthropology who 
has served as provost for the past 
ten years. Jordan will retire from 
the position on June 30. 

"I think to have a provost from 
the theater department actually 
raises the visibility of the arts and 
that means it's raising the en e 
among expected tudent and con-
tinuing students of a range of 
majors and training and minors 
that they don't nece arily think 
about," Jordan said. "I think thar's a 
very positive thing." 

Warren provost search commit-
tee member Dan Wulbert, Revelle 
College'S provost, echoed the senti-
ment. 

"The university and Warren 
College have many engineering 
students, and I think there's ome-
thing very nice about having 
another discipline represented ," 
Wulbert said.

Earl Warren Colle~e election officials 

received a total of 19 gnevances that accused 
various candidates of misconduct, induding 12 
on the last day of the general election, Warren

The majority of the complaints accused 
candidates of improper campaigning tech-

the 12 submitted on April 7, were withdrawn or 
settled informally. No candidates were disqual-

Because the Warren V.O.I.CE. and United

Triton Taxi faced with budget deficit 
Problem arises from spike in student use of service 

By NEIL SPEAIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Triton Taxi, the A.S.-sponsored 
"safe ride home" service, is facing a 
budget deficit of 59,600, which 
may grow to over S13,OOO before 
the end of the quarter, according 
to AS. Commissioner of Student 
Services Kelly Vasant. Vasant said 
that the deficit is due to an unell-
peered increase in the number of 
srudents using Triton Taxi. 

The AS. Council approved the 
reallocation of $8,000 from the 
operations and services account to 
help cover the costs during its 
April 7 meeting. Income from 
senior memory book photo shoots 
is CIpeCted to cover the remaining 
51,600 in bills. 

"I think this is a good problem 
that we're facing right now, 
because it means students are 
actually using our services," AS. 
Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd said. 

Triton Taxi service is contracted 
to Ooud 9 Shuttle, a San Diego-
based taxi, shuttle and limousine 
service. Under the tenns of the 
current agreement, Cloud 9 will 
provide enough shuttles so that 
srudents will not wait more than 40 
minutes from the time they request 
a ride to when they are picked up. 

Increased ridership over the 
past few months caused Cloud 9 
to allocate more shuttles to Triton 
Taxi and charge the A.S. Council 
accordingly. 

"The way this service works is 
on an as-needed basis," Vasant 
said. "There is no feasible way to . 
estimate how many srodents will 
use the service." 

The 2003-04 AS. ElIecutive 

' Budget cut Triton Taxi funding 
53,000 from the previous year, 
leaving 512,000 allocated for the 
service even though about 520,000 
was spent on Triton Taxi during 
the 2002-03 academic year, 
according to Vasant. 

No one could remember why 
Triton Taxi funding was reduced 
during discussion in the A.S. 
Finance Committee meeting on 
April 7. 

"We just need to be able to esti-
mate better on what it is and bow 
much we're going to spend," AS. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher 
said. "That's something we failed 
at this year and that's something I 
take responsibility for, as well I 
think the council should." 

During fall quarter 2003, some 
council members discussed the 
possibility of obtaining sponsor-
ships from local alcohol distribu-
tors for Triton Taxi. Since then, 
the UCSD administration has 
resisted accepting money from 
alcohol providers, Vasant said. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Freshman Senator Alan 
Haimowitz objected to the $8,000 
allocation because, he said, Cloud 
9 made no effort to alert the coun-
cil to the sharp increase in rider-
ship. 

"I think the least they could 
have done was contact us, to make 
sure that this would be all right, 
especially when we're dealing with 
such a huge sum of money," 
Haimowitz said. "I think it's total-
ly Wlfair that we're accepting full 
responsi bit ity." 

Other cOWlcilmembers took 
issue with the idea of trying to 
negotiate a new price with Cloud 9. 

"We made a bill, we have to 

pay it," Vasant said. "I don't think 
we've messed up." 

Gallagher agreed, calling the 
idea of renegotiation "unrealistic." 

Triton Taxi was unanimously 
hailed by councilmembers as a ser-
vice that provides safe rides home 
for people who are intoxicated or 
in Wlcomfortable siruations on 
Friday and Saturday nights. 

"This could potentially be 
about people's lives," A.S. 
Panhellenic represenutive Rachel 
Corell said. ' 

John Muir College Sophomore 
Senator Nam Bui echoed the 
statements of a handful of coun-
cilmembers. 

"This isn't money that's gone 
to waste, it's money well spent," 
8ui said. 

While the current funding 
crunch for the service seems to be 
solved, more bills for Triton Taxi 
loom on the horizon. One solu-
tion discussed by the finance com-
mittee was taking money from the 
mandated reserves account. 

"From what I understand 
about mandate reserves, mandate 
reserves are there for emergen-
cies," Vasant said. "And, well, we 
have a little bit of an emergency." 

A proposal to limit the number 
of students who can use the ser-
vice or the number of shuttles that 
Cloud 9 can send out on a given 
night was met with strong resis-
tance on the cOWlcil floor. 

"Can you really put a price or 
limit on student safety?" Vasant 
said. "If people are deciding 
whether to take Triton Tui home 
or whether to drive home drunk, I 

'would rather pay SI million a year 
for Triton Taxi so that no one gets 
hurt."

A Fox in the Chancellor's office 
Will Marye Anne Fox bring change to 
UCSD, or simply furthe~ an obsession 

with scientific departments? 

//;,1)/ 

By Kelly Gilbert, 
Staff Writer 

While UCSD chancellor nominee Marye Anne Fox has an impressive resume, 
it is one marred by several contro-
versial moves, Her nomination for 
the position has been, in fact, onJy 
slightly less controversial. 

So far, it seems that fortune has 
not smiled too brightly on the 
process. Due to an information leak 
in North Carolina, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes was forced to 
announce Fox's status as the finalist 
in UCSD's search for a chancdlor 
on April 2, the same day Fox 
announced her candidacy to trustees 
and executives at North Carolina 
State University. Several people 
have criticized the appointment of a 
candidate with a history of question-
able administrative action. 
Consequently, Fox will likely have 
to work harder to prove herself -
which, as a motivational factor, may 
not be a negative. 

An acclaimed teacher, author 
and scientist, Fox will, if appointed, 
preside over UCSD's eight vice 
chancellors. In an April 2 statement, 
Dynes wrote, "In the end, my deci-
sion was guided by my belief that 
Dr. Fox brings the combination of 
skills needed to build on UCSD's 
reputation as one of the finest uni-
versities in the world." 

Fox was previously considered 
for the UCSD's chancellor position 
(a nd , for that matter, a White 
House advisory position under 
President George W Bush). She has 
her name the "Who's Who" listings 
of America, the World, Science and 

Engineering, American Education, 
Women, and Men 'and Women of 
Science. 

Indubitably, Fox has an obvious 
penchant for academia as well as 
athletics. Her five years at NCSU 
were a decided boon to the school's 
sports programs: For example, she 
defended men's baslcetball coach 
Herb Sendek, who was recently 
named ACC Coach of the Year, 
against calls for replacement. 
Despite protests, she fired football 
coach Mike O'Cain and hired 
Chuck Amato, who consid'erably 
improved the team's standings and 
reputation. 

If Fox has the same devotion to 
the collegiate sports programs at 
UCSD that she did at NCSU, 
UCSD would almost ceruinly bene-
fit from the presence and policies of 
such an athletics-minded chancellor. 

Fox's reputation in the scientific 
field holds promise for UCSD's 
strong program. She's received 
scores of science-based awards and 
fellowships and has published in 
American Scientist, ChemWorld 
and various other publications, and 
is a renowned physical organic 
chemist and researcher. 

However, this apparent bias 
toward scientific 6elds will likely do 
nothing to improve UCSD's other 
programs, which already receive less 
attention and maintenance than the 
school's science and engineering 
programs. Currently while UCSD 
offers a myriad of majors in the field 
of biology alone, yet there is no tra-
ditional English major. There are 

.. 

just over 40 visual arts classes 
offered this quarter, but more than 
double that in biology. 

Under former Chancellor Dynes 
- who was also an award-winning 
physicist - a laboratory was found-
ed in 1991 to study properties of 
semiconductors, superconductors 
and metals. AJso during Dynes' 
tenure, a new pharmaceutical school

was established and the existing 
research budget increased by 36 
percent. In February 2004, under 
the supervision of Acting 
Chancellor Marsha A. Chandler, 
UCSD recruited Nobel Prize-win-
ning chemist Mario J. Molina. He 
joined the ranks of UCSD's other 16 
Nobel Prize winners, the vast 
majority of whom had received 
merit for their science or economic 

achievements. If appointed, FOll 
should follow the Univenity of 
California's declared credo of diver-
sity in academic disciplines and con-
centrate on building the school's 
other neglected programs. 

To improve UCSD's overall 
quality, Fox should not follow 
Dynes' precedent too closely in 
focusing primarily on scientific 
research. At NCSU, Fox aimed to 
make the school. premier research 
institute. From a business stand-
point (which the UC Board of 
Regents will likely assume when 
deciding whether to appoint Fox), 
increasing research at UCSD would 
boost the school's reputation but it 
may ultimately pr0ge hannfuI for 
students who would benefit more 
from improved teac:binr and curric-
ula. To improve UCSD's quality 
overall, Fox should not tollow 
Dynes' precedent too closely in 
focusing primarily on scientific 
research. 

Fox brings with her. CODtr<M:r-
sial - albeit impressive - history. 
In 2001, she fired her two vice 
provosts against the wishes of 
Provost Stuart L . Cooper, who 
resigned in protest. NCSU's Faculty 
Senate voted overwhelmingly in 
favor of censuring Fox, whose moti-
vation behind the firings, according 
to Fox's own statements in response, 
was the vice provosts' failure to 
adhere to Fox's vision. The provost 
was, in fact, the second of his posi-
tion to have resigned since Fox's 
appointment in 1998. . 

Rox unapologetically told North 

Carolina's Tht Nnvs tr ObstnJtr, 
KWhat I was trying to do was say, 
'There had to be chmges that had 
to be made.' The fact that Cooper 
was unwilling to go along with that 
meant I probably would have had to 
make mother change if he hadn't 

'gned " res! . 
It comes as little surprise that Fox 

has been disparaged as diffic:ult to 
work with, and has even been called 
a "generalissimo" on par wid! a 
"third-world dictatorship" by a stu-
dent senator at NCSU, according to 
Tbt Nt'IDI tr ObsmJer. The same l'U-
do-what-l-want attitude at UCSD 
could easily prove hannfuI both for 
Fox (pInicuIarIy as a new and reIa-
tiYely uninitiated employee) and 
UCSD. H Fox appliell her similar 

5 as at NCSU for UCSD, it is . that she will encounter height-en opposition. H~, students 
who have met Fox contend that she 
is a -student-friendly" administrator. 
As the mother of a blended family of 
live college graduates md an award-
winning teacher, Fox has the kind of 
bacIcground that could lead her to 
prioritize srudenta' concerns. 

AS. President-elect Jenn Pac, 
who served as a student representa-
tivt: on the chancellor's search com-
mittee, said, "What impressed me 
most was that students responded to 
her. She had won past awards for 
[teaching), including an award that 
the students voted fOr." 

Fox's appointment has great 
potential - but potential that could 
be used either for UCSD or against 
it. 

MONDAY, Al'\UL 12. 2004 WE UCSD GUARDIAN 

I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
April Foors prank hurt 
Journalistic integrity 

The student paper at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh 
fired a cartoonist who ran a 
racially derogatory cartoon in the 
April Fool's Day edition. 

At UCSD, the April Fool's 
Day edition of our primary cam-
pus paper, Tht Gllllrdilln, allied 
with Tbt KINI14 - a student orga-
nization humor publication noto-
riously regarded for its liberal use 
of racist, sexist, and anti-gay epi-
thets - to produce a four-page 
humor section. Past publicity acts 
included the wide distribution of 
a Muslim-hate paper titled 
"Jizzlam," which included illus-
trations of Muslim women getting 
raped. I was recently bombarded 
by a member of the KiulIII staff 
repeatedly messaging me the ten 
"nigger" and wallowing in their 
manipulativp. use of student funds. 

The GlIIlrdill7l editors are not 
the most humorous, but at least 
smart enough to anticipate the 
reactionary progressive responses 
to the obviously very political, 

"not political" choice to piggy-
back KiNlIII publicity. 

Aside from the occasionally 
useful coupons our primary stu-
dent paper is understood heavily 
as an opinion paper with typically 
an entire third of its content as

editorials and oplDlons. The 
Gu"rdilln is the most powerful 
campus publication, and the /(011111 
is clearly a politically oppositional 

student organitation. So, don't be 
silly. Contrary to what was writ-
ten in your alleged Kapology," it is 
not a reader's "prerogative" to 
make the Grurdilln's choices a 
political issue - you already 
have. 

The Grurdill7l's promotion of 
the Koalll has disturbed those who 
the KOIIIII have pointed clear 
oppositions to - SAAC, student 
cultural organizations, anti-racist 
organizations and media, and 
anyone oPjosed to a small group 
of spoile children screaming 
racist and sexist epi thets for the 
sake of indulgent self-promotion. 

At first I thought the guys dug 
into their parents' pockets and 
forked out the dough for full page 
ads. We found out in the follow-
ing paper, where a few more pages 
were allocated to the Koalll, that it 
was complicity supported by the 
GlIIlrdilln. 

It's pretty shameful to see 
UCSD's primary publication fur-
ther its lack of responsible and 
credible journalism by resorting 
to affiliating with the shock tac-
tics of the Kiulill . 

I do not care "how funny" you 
guys think you are. Please do your 
job as to respect the diverse range 
of oppositions and sensibilities at 
this campus. Be accountable to 
those who you seek to exclude in 
promoting your divisive agendas 
- whether it be promoting for 
the KOlIlII's speech or saturating 
intellectual waste bins of the op-
eds.

6 OPINION THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Censuring A.S. president is unwise 
Senator's bill would unfairly punish Gallagher 

for campuswide e..-mail endorsement of Pae 
By DANIEL WArn 

Opinion Editor 

At least they're not tossing 
tables or screaming "racist bas-
tards" this year. 

In April 2003, Students First! 
candida tes screamed in agony 
after their disqualification, 
tossed tables and verbally 
assaulted all within earshot. 

After Jenn Pae's overwhelm-
ing victory - 1,691 votes to 
1,047 - on April 9 in the A.S. 
presidential runoff election over 
Harish Nandagopal, Students 
First! supporters responded with 
silence and downcast eyes. Two 
or tHree offered half-hearted 
congratulations to Pae, before 
shuffling out of Round Table 
Pizza. Noticeably, Nandagopal 
did not offer congratulations 
immediately after hearing the 
election results, and instead 
walked out of the courtyard with 
his cohorts. 

They have since regrouped and 
rediscovered their outrage. 
Thurgood Marshall College jw1ior 
senator Kate Maull, a staunch 
Students First! supporter, has 
called for the censure of A.S. 
President Jeremy Gallagher for an 
e-mail he sem out to hundreds of 
students during the runoff elec-
tion. The e-mail.whichread.in 
part, "I am voting Jenn Pae, but 
most importantly, spread the word 
to get the vote out!" was signed 
"J eremy Paul Gallagher, A.S. 
President, UCSD." The e-mail 
did not explicitly call on students 
to vote for Pae, but its intention-
conveying the A.S. president's 

endorsement of Pae - was clear. 
Maull's reasons for the censure 

are misleading. In e-rnails sent to 
the AS. Councillistserv, Maull said 
that Gallagher, by "virtue of his 
office,» had access to the e-mail 
accounts that received his message. 
The resolution itself refers to elec-
tion bylaws that forbid candidates 
and slates to use

Any student at UCSD can scan

from Academic Computing 
Services, and any Web user can 
type in combinations of letters on 

StudentLink to 
"ASUCSD offices, 
services, enterpris-
es or equipment" 
for campaign pur-
poses. It also men-
tions a rule govern-
ing the conduct of 
officeholders, 
requiring that they 
refrain from 
endorsing candi-

state and local pub-
lic office. Maull 
concludes that

speech at the 
John Kerry rally 
two weeks ago. 
Kerry is running 
for president, a 
"national public 
office" covered 
by the A.S. 
bylaws. Of course 

Nowhere in the A.S. bylaws or the 
election bylaws are A.S. officials 
banned from endorsing candidates 
for student government, and 
Maull's assertion that Gallagher 
gained "accessh to his address book 
through the AS. presidency is 

Maull wouldn't 
do that, since she herself - as 
president of the College 
Democrats - helped to organize

president Jeremy Gallagher" and 
delivers a speech in front of thou-
sands of students. 

Maull seems to be searching 
for reasons to justify the over-
whelming defeat of the Students 
First! presidential candidate. 
Gallagher is her scapegoat; he's 
an easy, high-profile target on 
which to pin the blame for their 
loss. He "abused" his high office 
- a supposed advantage that was 
either not available to 
Nandagopal, or that he chose 
not to use. 

Maull's censure resolution, co-
sponsored by Student Affirmative 
Action Committee representative 
Daniel Gonzales, reeks of politics 
as usual. If Nandagopal had won 
the election, would we be seeing a 
resolution calling for Gallagher'S 
censure? That would just be rub-
bing salt into the wound. But since 
Pae won, Students First! is free to 
throw blame on everyone except 
on whom it belongs: the candidate 
himself. 

Hopefully, we can expect more 
from the likes of Maull - who 
was just elected Marshall senior 
senator - over the course of the 
2004-2005 term. If this is a sign of 
things to come, it does not bode 
well for the new Srudents First'-
dominated council. 

The senators should shut 
down this censure in the internal 
committee and not let it reach 
the council floor. This A.S. 
Council should be doing more 
productive things with its 
remaining time. Maull's "Bill of 
Censure," as she calis it, doesn't 
deserve to see the light of day.

Letter: 
Kerry's 

platform did 
not differ 

from Bush's 
coruinued from page 5 

day. 
On to Kerry: John Kerry is sup-

posed to present an alternative to 
Bush. However, the platform he 
chose was centered on low gas 
prices, as loudly suted by the thirty 
foot sign, "Low gas prices fuel the 
economy." Now, how is that envi-
ronmental? How is that different 
from Bush? Despite some discus-
sion of alternative energy sources 
and a commitment to stay out of 
ANWR, clearly the take-home 
message is that we need oil, and lots 
of it. 

Let me make myself clear: I do 
not want Bush in power. ( would, 
however, hope that the one "liberal" 
option would be a bit more on the 
liberal side. 

If UCSD worked to bring Kerry 
here in an effort to promote voting 
and fight apathy, and had done it in 
a manner that neither violated fire 
laws, disrupted class nor endorsed 
him, then I would applaud their 
efforts. 

But as it is, Kerry wanted some-
thing to campaign around - the 
economy - and saw that San 
Diego has the highest gas prices in 
the counay. Most likely, a little 
over a week ago his campaign 
called UCSD to ask if they could 
hold a press conference here. The 
university more than willingly 
obliged and in their scramble to 
host him, they ignored everybody 
else. To make matters worse, Kerry 
chose a poor platform. How dis-
gusting. 

To anybody that cares about the 
world or your education, I encour-
age you to speak out. Contact the 
vice chancellor of student affairs. 
This November, vote Green. After 
all, California will go with the 
Democrat anyway. The only presi-
den tial vote wasted is either for a 
Democrat, or, especially, for a 
Republican.

Pae said she does not foresee

"We're going to be able to get

be able to work together for the 
interest of the students and do the 
best job we can." 

Cat Yapyuco, who successfully

accounted for 120 votes. 

Bugea will join Eric Guico, who 
secured Marshall's first at-large 
position in the general election. 

ing methods and a much shorter 
ballot than in the general election. 

Both candidates and supporters 
mobilized voters on Library Walle 
in two days of runoff voting. On 
April 9, Nandagopal handed out 
bottled warer, bought with sup-
porter donations and labeled with 
his name, to promote the election. 

The candidates said many voters 
told them they had alre:ady voted, 
WlIWVC that they needed to vote 
again a second time, in the runoff. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Valentina Martin, who 
cast her ballot at computers set up 
on Library Walk, said she did not 
know of the runoff election before 
one of the candidates told her. 

However, the two days of cam-
paigning were not without con-
tention. Several Students First! 
slate members became upset with 
an e-mail sent by current AS. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher to 
undisclosed recipients, in which he 
called on voters to participate and 
also announced his suppon for Pae. 

"I'm voting for Jenn Pae," 
Gallagher stated in the e-mail, urg-
ing students to ask him why and 
including his position, in addition 
to his name, in the e-mail signature. 

In a resolution submitted to the 
A.S. Counc.il five hours before the 
results of the runoff were 
announced, Revelle College senior 
Ted McCombs and Earl Warren

inappropriate for his office," 
McCombs said. WIt's inappropriate 
for any officer of A. S. to use his or 
her title to endorse a candidate. " 

By analyzing the time stamps 
and server redirections in the e-
mail's header, Hsu and McCombs 
say they believe the e-mail may 
have reached thousands of students, 
including those on the AS. limerv. 

According to McCombs, 

Ward defended the e-mail, argu-
ing that it represented a form of 
protected speech. 

"I don't thinlc this resolution is a 
smart idea," Ward said, explaining 
that AS. elections were not covered 
by the endorsement prohibition. "I 
did nOt think it was inappropriate at 
all. I think that, as the current pres-
ident, he is allowed to say, 'I know 
what the president has to do and 
think this person is a better fit.'" 

Marshall students turned Out in 
some of the largest numbers for the 
election, with IS.2 percent voting, 
second to only Sixth College, with 
IS.9 percent. Earl Warren College 
registered the lowest participation, 
with 11.4 percent voting. 

. College senior Kevin Shawn Hsu 
called for Gallagher'S censure. 

Gallagher came within a "hair's 
breath" of violating A.S. bylaws 
that prohibit council members 
from endorsing national, state and 
local candidates. McCombs said he 
did not believe Pae knew of 
Gallagher's plan to send the e-mail. 

Pae, who ran for vice president 
internal on the Unity slate last year, 
said she appreciated Gallagher'S 
support but also understood the 
position of the resolution's baclcers. Overall, the runoff election 

drew 14.3 percent of eligible vot-
ers, more than one and a half times 
the amount -in.i tially predicted by 
Chapman. In the general election, . 
17.8 percent of students voted. 

"I'm pleasandy surprised by the 
srudent turnout," Chapman said, 
crediting the large numbers to 
Pae's and Nandagopal's campaign-

McCombs successfully ran 
unopposed on Students First! to 
become Revelle senior senator-
elect and Hsu was the slate's pres-
idential nominee in 2003, garner-
ing the most votes in his race 
before being disqualified along 
with the rest of the Students First! 
candidates. 

"We thought that presicknt

Nandagopal called Gallagher's 
actions "unethical ~ and said he sup-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY. APRIL 12.2004 

Heritage: Groups fight for language classes 
continued from page I 

want to offer as many levels of the 
language as we can." 

Currenrly, there are three full 
sections in Viemamese, one full 
section each in Korean and 
Armenian, and two full sections 
each in Tagalog and Persian. 

The program is the first of its 
kind, !>ffering a single, coordinated 
program for heritage language stu-
dents. \Vith the state's budget cuts 
and the fact that heritage language 
dasses are fairly new in the depart-
ment, funding for the counes is 
especially vulnerable, according to 
K1eunder. 

Primary funding for the pro-
gram comes from the social sci-
ences department. However, 
because those teaching in the pro-
gram are not regular lilculty, the 
deparnnent uses a temporary 
instructor budget for instructor 
salaries. 

"Until [the deparnnent) has an 
established program that gets fund-
ed on a regular basis, because the 
programs are still in the process of 
growing, I have to take that out of 
my temporary instructor budget," 
Kleunder said. "Currently, the 
temporary allocations for next year 
are tight." 

The linguistics deparnnent is 
currently meeting with several stu-
dent organizations that are interest-
ed in raising funds for the dasses. 

According to Kleunder, it is of 
academic interest for the university 
to support the program. 

"Second-language acquisition is 
an interesting area of research," 
Kleunder said. "Heritage language 
speakers, the conversation strate-
gies that they use, and the compen-
sation strategies that they use ... are 
very similar across the languages." 

Students that are currently 
working on fundraising for heritage 
language courses stress the pro-
gram's importance to the commu-
nity. 

"For the students ... it's a chance 
to get in touch with their heritage 
and culture, and at the same time to 

get UC credits," said Frank Vuong, 
Viemamese Student Association 
vice president external. "If you 
want students to graduate and 
become effective leaders, we need 
to be able to communicate to the 
Vietnamese community." 

According to Vuong, the uni-
versity shoufd provide Vietnamese 
classes because there exists a high 
demand among students. Vuong 
and other students are currently 
working on approaching !=onununi-
ty business owners and applying for 
grants. 

"The number of students who 
sign up for the dasses is over-
whelming," Vuong said. "It's an 
obligation of the university to fulfill 
student demands and answer the 
general ethnographic demand of 
the community." 

Students taking Tagalog classes 
are also looking for ways 10 raise 
funds for the courses, and have 
formed the group Pilipino 
Students Saving Tagalog 2004 in 
order to find different ways to raise 
money. 

"It's important to learn about 
our culture," said Jorieth Jose, a 
coordinator of PSST 2004. "nne 
classes] are the best ourlet for us to 
learn about our language and our 
culture." 

Plans include asking conununity 
members for donations, car washes 
and a benefit banquet. 

"The university should support 
[the dasses) because they support 
languages such as Spanish, and why 
should this be any different'" Jose 
said. "There are a lot of Filipinos in 
San Diego, and the university 
shouldn't neglect that." 

The Persian Club is planning a 
black-tie dinner and conununity 
outreach to raise funds. 

"The dass is important in that 
many in this generation may know 
how to speale, but very few know 
how to read or write," said Soheil 
Auari, vice president of the 
Persian Club. "The ability to com-
municate is an inwluable asset. 
We need to realize there's more [0 

our education than math and sci-
ence - there) our own personal 
culture." 

Members of the Armenian 
Student Asaociation will also be 
holding mixers, dinner dances, 
concerts and adler events at the 
Armenian Church in San Diego to 
raise money for the classes. 

The Heritage Western 
Armenian class was the first class 
to be established within the pro-
gram. According to ASA president 
Mike Gedjeyan, students learn 
about Armenian culture and histo-
ry that might not be available else-
where. 

"A typical Armenian student 
who is a product of the American 
school system doesn't learn much 
about his or her own history, lan-
guage and culture," Gedjeyan said. 
"This class offers such an experi-
ence for students in that situation. 
Students are invited to take the 
course to learn more about 
Armenian culture, heritage and 
history. They also learn how to 
read, write and speak the lan-
guage." 

According to Kleunder, the lin-
guistics department is also planning 
to meet with all of the student 
organizations involved in fundrais-
ing, in order to exchange ideas and 
work together. 

"I think of it also as an educa-
tional exercise in political organiza-
tion," Kleunder said. "It's a really 
good opportunity to bring student 
organizations together, worKing 
together to achieve that common 
goal. It's also a good lesson in col-
lective action in order to achieve a 
political goal." 

Many of the students involved 
pointed to high demand for the 
classes. 

"We have wireless Internet on 
Library Walk, hands-free paper 
towel dispensers in the bathroom 
- yet we can't afford to save a class 
which students actually want?" 
Attari said. "How many math class-
es do you see students fighting to 
keep?" 

Provost: Adler to take office July 1 
continued from page I 

stand the way Warren College 
works and will not be coming in 
"with an agenda for change for the 
sake of change. " 

"My mission is to provide the 
best academic support for the col-
lege possible," Adler said. 

In his 17 years at the university, 
Adler has worked with both under-
graduate and graduate students. 
His enjoyment of worKing with 
undergraduates led to his interest 
in the provost position, he said. 

"A significant amount of plea-
sure came from working with the 
undergraduates, and I was looking 
for a bigger canvas to paint on . .. 

and I think the provost job afford-
ed me that opportunity," Adler 
said. . 

Adler's experiences in stage 
management include several 
national tours and Broadway pro-
ductions such as "Dance a Little 
Closer," "Camelot," and the Tony 
Award-winning "Big River." He 
has also served as production stage 
manager for several musicals at the 
La Jolla Playhouse. 

"[Adler's] just an incredibly 
bright and outgoing guy who's 
done wonderful things academical-
ly in the deparonent of theater and 
dance and in stage management,"

Given the recent conclusion of the March California primary elections and the onset of federal, state, and 
local political campaigns for the November elections, I would like to take the opportunity to share with 
you the University of California, San Diego's policy on use of campus resources for campaign-related 
activities. 

As you know, UCSD is a nonpartisan State institution whose primary missions are teaching, research, and 
public service. In accordance with the public service aspect of the University, UCSD resources, including 
its libraries, museums, performing arts spaces, gardens and science centers, are generally open to all 
Californians. 

As an instrumentality of the State, the University must remain neutral on all political campaign matters. 
It neither officially sponsors nor funds campaign activities. Candidates for elected office may, however, 
engage in campaign activities on University grounds, buildings, or properties as invited, sponsored speakers 
of University-affiliated organizations. Examples of UCSD-affiliated organizations are independent student 
organizations registered at UCSD in various categories, such as pllitical, cultural or social. 

Assigned space for conducting any such activity is charged at establish~d rates, which recover building 
depreciation, debt service, custodial services, and utilities, There is no charge for incidental use of space; 
for example, the use of classrooms for informational meetings. Repetitive or scheduled reservation of space 
is not considered incidental. 

I hope this helps to clarify UCSD's policy and regulations pertaining to on-campus campaign activities. 
If you have any questions, please do I;l0t hesitate to conta~t Associate Vice Chancellor for Government and 
Community Relations Ed Furtek at (858) 534-8400. 

Sincerely, 

Edward Furtek 
Associate Vice Chancellor

Meal Point 'Cuisine 

The best on-campus picks that meal points can buy 
The South Beach Diet 

ay DINA MMlrCAIiuNG 
Contributing Writer 

You've seen the boob on the 
shelves of Costco and Borders. 
You've heard people nnt and rave 
about another new weight loss 
plan; The South Beach diet boasts 
that it can make you want to wear 
a bathing suit in public. 

Dr. Arthur Agatston, a cardiol-
ogist from Miami, developed this 
new diet specifically for his over-
weight heart patients. The South 
Beach diet is split into three differ-
ent phases, each with its own spe-
ci1ic meal plans and recipes. Dr. 
Agatston recommends a healthy 
balance between "good" carns and 
tilts. "Bad" carbs include highly 
processed baked good , soda and 
anything with high sugar content 
such as ice creaJl1 and candy. A cor-
rect balance of food wiU allow your 
body to metabolize faster without 
excessive sugar and high-calorie 
food to slow it down. 

o what' the de<ll \\ ith the 
thr~e phases? Let\ take a look at 
the ba ic breakdown of the outh 
Beach diet and ho\\ you can make 
it worl.. \\ith the food at CS D's 
dining halls: 

P'- b-Rapid Weight Loss 
of 8 to 13 pounds. 

Duntioo: 2 weeks 
Difficulty: Strict 
What you can eat: 

Everything except fruit, bread, 
rice, polllt0e5, pasta, sugar, alco-
hol, baked goods and junk food 
during all meals and snacks. After 
t 4 days, you may begin to add 
these foods back into your rou-
tine. According to Dr. Agatston, 
"During the first week the crav-

. ings will virrually disappear." 
Sample dishes: Grilled runa 

steak with green beans at Cafe 
Ventanas; charbroiled sa lmon 
patty with a green salad at 
Canyon Vista; Mediterranean 
chicken salad u Ocean View 
Terrace; veggies with a 
Mediterranean steak at Plaza 
Cafe; a hearty came cnili at Sierra 
Summit; or Oriental sa lad with 
cold shrimp at Foodworx. 

After significant weight loss, 
your body wi ll be accustomed to 
eati ng good, healthy food. 1 his i~ 
not because you are eating bs, 
but because you are eating right 
.lnd staying awar from the high-
fat foods your body used to Cr:lve. 
The recipes for Phase 2 incorpo-

loll It .. : Though white rice isn't allowed in the South Beach Diet's stricter 
phases, you can order sashimi (riM fish) from the cafe Ventanas sushi bar. 

What not to eat 
By Kim GILaElr 

Staff Writer 
Even for a student who isn't 

under special dietary restrictions, 
the various selections at on-cam-
pus cafeterias should not be 
viewed as a free-for-all. For the 
sake of health, sanitation and one's 
appetite, there are several foods 
that are best to avoid. 

With foods that require lots of 
cooking time, make sure they are 
well-done before you pay up. 

"At the beginning of the year, 
the pizza at [Revelle'S] Plaza was 
always really doughy and under-
cooked," John Muir College 
freshmanJanice Lin said. 

Many students find the cuts of 
mea t at several cafeterias to be 
subswldard. 

uThe chicken at [Muir's] 
Sierra Summit that they put in 

the stir-fry, on pizza and in que-
sadillas is so nasty. It's mostly like 
bone, cartilage and fat in indistin-
guishable pieces," Muir freshman 
Kendra Kadas said. "[Summit 
needs] to change to the chicken 
pieces that [Oceanview Temce] 
has - chick.en chunks that actu-
a1Jy tlste and look like edible 
chicken." 

Speaking of chicken, Muir 
freshman Scott Hogan said his 
least favorite food on campus was 
Swnmit's Oriental orange chick-
en. Though some careterias do a 
decent job with various "ethnic" 
foods such as Cafe! Ventlnas' 
authentic sushi, most are a gam-
ble, according to Hogan. 

As a general rule, it's .!SO pru-
dent to avoid food that isn't made 
in froin of you - particularly with 
burritos, tacos or other dishes in 
which undesirable ingredients 

rates foods like bread, rice and 
even chocolate. Believe it or not, 
you can eat as much of the food 
in the meal plan as you want. 

Phase 2: Ongoing Weight 
Loss 

Duration: Until you reach 
your ideal wei~t (weigbt loss is 
usually one to two pounds per 
week). 

Difficulty: Moderate 
What you can eat: Eat chick-

en, turkey, fish , shellfish, vegeta-
bles, eggs, cheese, nuts and sal-
ads. The specific meal plan 
inel udes reci pes for three mea Is, a 
mid-morning snack. and after-
noon snack and a dessert after 
dinner. 

Sample dishes: Sa lmon or 
chicken Caesar sa lad at Cafe 
Ventanas; Beef Burgundy with 
baby ca rrots at Canyon Vi ta; 
Chinese tofu salad at OceanView 
' Ierrace; chicken parme.~an at Pla7.a 
C'lfc; Thai chicken salad at Sierra 
Summit; and a g:mlen salad \\~th 
~vocado and chicken at Food\\or... 

The purpose of thi~ rha~c is to 
form good eating rouon.:s that 
cause gradual weight los,. The diet 

i~ more flexible th.m Phase 1 sincc 
yOU ean incorptlr:lte C'Jrbs and 
sweets in healthy quantities while 
still losillg those love handles. 

Phase 3: ,"'1ai nrnin Weight 
Duration: The rest of your 

Li fe 
Difficulty: Easy 
What you can eat: Anything 

at the dining halls in nonnal-
sized portions. 

Now that your body has 
reached its ideal weighr, you sim-
ply need to follow a few basic rules 
while eating regular foods. By this 
phase, your body should be condi-
tioned to eating right because 
good habits have been fonned 
throughout Phases t and 2. 

Check out Dr. Agatston's new 
book, "The South Beach Diet: 
The Delicious, Doctor-
Designed, Foolproof Plan for 
Fast and Healthy Weight Loss," 
if you want to look even better in 
that bathing suit. 

could be hidden. 
"When I was eating at Canyon 

Vista, I got a soft tlco and bit into 
something hard," Stephanie Lin, a 
Revelle College freshman, said. 
"When I took it our, it wasn't 
meat or bone, but this question-
able, rod-like substance." 

But even foods made while you 
watch aren't always safe. 

"Avoid Summit brealcfast bur-
ritos," Muir freshman Jesse 
Rodriguez said. "They're a mess 
and a ripoff compared to OVT -
leSs food for your money, and less 
quality." 

According to Lui, the dining 
balls may be a little too imagina-
tive with their culinary creations. 

"Someone told me once that 
he saw a sign somewhere in the 
back of one of the cafeterias that's 
for workers, and it said 'Leftovers: 
use creatively!'" she said.

Often deemed "too good to 
be true," the Atkins diet has 
found its way into the lives of 
many weight-loss hopefuls. 
Adhering to such strict guide-
lines might be difficult at other 
colleges, but the unique meal 
points program from Housing 
and Dining Services provides 
srudents with alternatives and 
incentives to eat only as much 
or as little as they would like at 
one time, and not buffet style, 
which i conducive to overeat-
ing. 

The Atkins Diet i a low-
carbohydrate plan. While most 
would think of diets as ea ting 
fruits and vegctah les, the 
Atkins diet calls for lhe COIll-
plete opposite. In~tcad of eat-
ing curhohydrate~ ulHI ~ugar, 
people following the diet cat 
11leal\ "ith plcnt} of fat and 
protein, found mainl) in meat-
and chee~es. Fl'uit~ are entirch 
cut out from the diet ,inc~ 
they mainly contain sugars. 
Dr. Robert Atkin,' reasoning 
behind th e diet plan is to 
change meta boli~1l1 and came 
the body to switch from burn-
ing carbohydrates and glucose 
to burning stored fat in the 
body for energy, inducing 
weight loss. 

It may seem difficult to follow 
a diet limited to futty proteins 
and small amounts of vegernbles, 
but amongst the pasta bars and 
lasagna trays, there are many 
options for followers of the 
Atkins diet at the dining hall s. 

At all dining halls, meals and 
plates that often include a main 
course along with two side dish-
es can be bought separately. At 
Foodworx in Sixth College, cus-
tomers can order steak and fish 
a la carte on Wednesdays. 
Prices for the full entree range 
from $4 to $5.50, so prices for 
the main courses are even less. 
On other nights throughout the 
week, Foodworx serves roast 

beef and baked chicken. 
Canyon Vista in Earl 

Warren College also has many 
specialty dishes, such as Beef 
Burgundy on Tuesday nights. 
Although it can be served with 
noodles and vegetable , the dish 
a la carte is priced at only $3. 
With a full grill, customers can 
ea ily order beef or chicken pat-
ties wrapped in lettuce with 
cheese instead of getting it in a 
bun. Ocean View Terrace in 
Thurgood Marshall College, 
Sierra ummit in John Muir 

ollege, Plna Cafe in Revelle 
College and afe Venrnna, in 
Eleanor Roosevelt College all 
have grills that take personal-
iced orders, so cus toll1cr~ can 
specify 'th at they want their 
burger bllnlc~s. 

Sierm Summit fcaturc~ a 
Lan ing \tation I\ith turkey, 
Black Forest ham, pa~trJl1l i J lld 
pork loin that can be put in 
sandll ichc~ or cned h\ Ihdf. 
Thi ()pt1on~ work> OUt nil:cI~ 
for tho;c on the Alkin~ ' Dlct, 
incc you can get freshly caned 

deli me,lt without the additional 
carbohydrates present in bread. 

For those looking for a fine 
dining t!xperiencl:!, Cafe 
Ventanas has chefs that \\ ill 
charbroil, saute, or gri ll 
seafood, chicken, tofu and beef. 
On Tuesday nights, the featured 
dish i gri ll ed swordfish for 
$7.95, while on Thursday 
nights, they serve chicken 
breasts for $3.50. They 3rt' usu-
ally served with a side of veg-
:ries, which fits in nicely with 
the Atkins' Diet. 

A low-carbohydrate diet is 
not as difficult to follow with 
the dining halls on campus as 
one might imagine. With din-
ing dollars, it is possible to 
spend selectively in tead of 
binging on buffet-style meals. 
Though you might have to 
give up personal pizzas and 
made-to-order iCt! creams, 
there are a lot of low-carb and 
high-protein options available 
that will help you lose weight. 

Low-CIIb opIIoM: Since bread is not allowed in the Atkins Die~ an 
alternative to the sandwich is to get freshly carved deli meat with veggies.

The best on-campus picks that meal points can buy 
The South Beach Diet 

Iy DINA MAIII'~ 
Contributifll Writer 

You've seen the books on the 
shelves of Costro and Bonlers. 
You've beanf people rant and rave 
about another new weight loss 
plan: The South Beach diet boasts 
that it can make you want to wear 
a bathing suit in public. 

Dr. Arthur Agatston, a cardiol-
ogist from Miami, developed this 
new diet speci6cally for his over-
weight heart patients. The South 
Beach diet is split into three differ-
ent phases, each with its own spe-
cific meal plans and recipes. Dr. 
Agatston recommends a healthy 
balance between "good" carbs and 
fats. "Bad" carbs include highly 
processed baked goods, sodas and 
anything with high sugar content 
such as ice cream and candy. A cor-
rect ba lance of food will allow your

What not to eat 
By KELLY GILaEII' 

Staff Writer 

Even for a student who isn't 
under special dietary restrictions, 
the various selections at on-cam-
pus cafeterias should not be 
viewed as a free-for-all. For the 
sake of health, sanitation and one's 
appetite, there are several foods 
that are best to avoid. 

With foods that require lots of 
cooking time, make sure they are 
well-done before you pay up. 

"At the beginning of the year, 
the pizza at [Revelle's] PiKa was 
always really doughy and under-
cooked," John Muir College 
freslunanJanice Lin said. 

Many students find the cuts of 
meat at several cafeterias to be 
substandard. 

"The chicken at [Muir's] 
Sierra Summit that they put in 

the stir-fry, on pizza and in que-
sadillas is so nasty. It's mostly like 
bone, cartilage and fat in indistin-
guishable pieces," Muir freshman 
Kendra Kadas said. "[Summit 
needs] to change to the chicken 
pieces that [Oceanview Terrace] 
has - chicken chunks that acru-
ally taste and look like edible 
chicken." 

Speaking of chicken, Muir 
freshman Scott Hogan said his 
least favorite food on campus was 
Summit's Oriental orange chick-
en. Though some cafeterias do a 
decent job with various "ethnic" 
fOods such as Cafe Ventanas' 
authentic sushi, most are a gam-
ble, according to Hogan. 

As a genent rule, it's also pru-
dent to avoid food that isn't made 
in frOnt of you - particularly with 
burritos, tlICOS or other dishes in 
which undesirable ingredients 

rates foods like bread, rice and 
even chocolate. Believe it or not, 
you can eat as much of the food 
in the meal plan as you want. 

Phase 2: Ongoing Weight 
Loss 

Duration: Until you reach 
your ideal wei~t (weight loss is 
usually one to two pounds per 
week). 

Difficulty: Moderate 
What you can eat: Eat chick-

en, turkey, fish, shellfish, vegeta-
bles, eggs, cheese, nuts and sal-
ads. The specific meal plan 
includes recipes for three meals, a 
mid-morning snack, and after-
noon snack and a dessert after 
dinner. 

Sample dishes: Salmon or 
chicken Cae ar sa lad at Cafe 
Ventanas; Beef Burgundy with 
baby carrots at Canyon Vista ; 
Chinese tofu salad at Ocean View 
' Ierrace; chicken pannesan at Pla7.a 
Cafe; Thai chicken salad at icrra 
Summit; and a g'Jrden sabd with 
dvocado and chi2ken at Fo()dW(l~ . 

The purpose of thi~ phase IS to 
form good eating routines that 
cause gt':ldual 1\ eight lo~ . ' Ole dkt

Phase 3: ,'vlaintain Weight 
Duration: The re t of your 

li fe 
Difficulty: Easy 
What you can eat: Anything 

at the dining halls in normal-
sized portions. 

Now that your body has 
reached irs ideal weight, you sim-
ply need to follow a few basic rules 
while eating regular foods. By this 
phase, your body should be condi-
tioned to eating right because 
good habits have been fonned 
throughout Phases I and 2.

book, "The South · Beach Diet:

could be hidden. 
"When I was eating at Canyon 

VISta, I got a soft taco and bit into 
something hard," Stephanie Lin, a 
Revelle College freshman, said. 
"When I took it out, it wasn't 
meat or bone, but this question-
able, rock-like substance." 

But even foods made while you 
watch aren't always safe. 

"Avoid Swrunit breakfast bur-
ritos," Muir freshman Jesse 
Rodriguez said. "They're a mess 
an~ a ripoff compared to ovr -
less food for your money, and less 
quality." 

According to Lui, the dining 
halls may be a little too imagina-
tive with their culinal}' creations. 

"Someone told me once that 
he saw a sign somewhere in the 
baclc of one of the cafeterias thats 
for workers, and it said 'Leftovers: 
use creatively!'" she said. 

The low-carbohydrate, 
high-protein Atkins Diet 

IyIHUIWU 
Contributing Writer 

Often deemed "too good to 
be true, ~ the Atkins diet has 
found its way into the lives of 
many weight-loss hopefuls. 
Adhering to such strict guide-
lines might be difficult at other 
colleges, but the unique meal 
points program from Hous ing 
and Dining Services provides 
students with alternatives and 
incentives to eat only 3 much 
or a little as they would like at 
one time, and not buffet style, 
which i conducive to overeat-
ing.

Dr. Koben Atkim' reasoning 
behind the diel plan is to 
change metabolism and ca use 
the body to switch from burn-
ing carbohydrates and glucose 
to burning stored fat in the 
body for energy, inducing 
weight loss. 

It may seem difficult to follow 
a diet limited to fatty proteins 
and small amounts of vegetables, 
but amongst the pasta bars and 
lasagna ' trays, there are many 
options for followers of the 
Atkins diet at the dining halls. 

At aU dining halls, meals and 
plates that often include a main 
course along with two side dish-
es can be bought separately. At 
Foodworx in Sixth College, cus-
tomers can order steak and fish 
a la carte on Wednesdays. 
Prices for the full entree range 
from $4 to $5.50, so prices for 
the main courses are even less. 
On other nights throughout the 
week, Foodworx serves roast 

beef and baked chicken. 
Canyon Vista in Earl 

Warren College also has many 
specialty dishes, such as Beef 
Burgundy on 1uesday nights. 
Although it can be served with 
noodles and vegetables, the dish 
a la carte is priced at only $3. 
With a full gri ll , customers can 
easi ly order beef or chicken pat-
ties wrapped in lettuce with 
cheese instead of getting it in a

nights, they serve chicken 
breasts for $3.50. They arc usu-
ally served with a side of veg-
gies, which fits in nicely with 
the Atkins' Diet. 

A low -carbohydrate diet is 
not as difficult to foll ow with 
the dining halls on campus as 
one might imagine. With din-
ing dollars, it is possible to 
spend selectively instead of 
binging on buffet-style meals. 
Though you might have to 
give up personal pizzas and 
made-to-order ice creams, 
there are a lot of low-carb and 
high-protein options avai lable 
that will help you lose weight. 

Low-cIIb options: Since bread is not allowed in the Atkins Die~ an 
alternative to the sandwich is to get freshly carved deli meat with veggies.

Asayake Taiko drums 
their way to the top 

First performance to be held 
next week at culture show 

By USAMAK 
Sen ior Staff 'M'iter 

For the past two years, Asayalce 
Taileo has practiced their music in 
garages and in the rooms at 
RIMAe. They've used the most 
primitive instruments, from phone 
booles to car tires. They've self-
organized their entire team, and 
spent the long days of summer 
making their own drums from 
scratch. 

And now Asayake Taileo, 
UCSD s first and only student taiko 
performing group, is ready to malce 
an appearance on campus. 

Taileo refers to the modem art 
of Japanese drum ensembles. Both 
a musical and artistic endeavor, 
taiko was tradition-

" 

ing how to play. 
"I have a vast interest in the 

Japanese language and culture, and 
I figured that doing taileo was a 
good way of expanding that interest 
and knowledge," Melencio said. 

Asayake Taiko will perform for 
the first time on April 18 at the 
Nikkei Student Union culture 
show at Neurosciences Institute 
and on May 21 at the daytime 
events of the Sun God Festival. 
The team will also participate in an 
invitational at Stanford scheduled 
from May 28 to May 31. 

The group will perform two sets 
of pieces at their shows: "Matsuri," 
a well-Icnown traditional piece that 
most taileo players learn first, and 
"Arashi," a piece composed by one 

of the founders of 
ally used in Japan 
on the battlefields, 
in religious cere-
monies and in 
refined cultural 
settings. The tradi-
tion became well-
established in 
Japanese-American 
communities in 
North America 
after the second 
World War, and 
today there are 
over - 150 taiko 
groups in North 
America. 

I think the hardest 

the team. 
According to 
Melencio, the new 
obstacle for 
Asayake Taiko is to 
reach "perfor-
mance-level taileo 
playing."

Asayalee Taileo began in 2002 
with a small group of UCSD stu-
dents who were interested in this 
musical an form. Most members 
had no prior experience, and the 
team had no real taileo drums to 
worle with. Members learned taileo 
fundamentals by hitting phone 
booles and tires strapped to chairs. 

"I thinlc the hardest pan was 
getting people committed to taileo 
without drums," said Marissa 
Miyao, a Thurgood Marshall 
College junior. 

The team spent the past sum-
mer constructing their faiko 
drums from large· wine barrels. 
Individual staves from the barrels 
were glued together, sanded and 
varnished. Cowhide was stretched 
across the outside of the barrels to 
form the head of the drums. 
Although the team faced several 
difficulties in malcing the drums, 
they have recently been finished 
and the team has started practic-
ing on them. 

In addition to creating the 
drums, team members also had to 
continually motivate themselves 
and each other. 

"It's a newly developed group, 
so not only do you have to join, 
[but) you have to talce initiative to 
manage and create the club," 
Marshall junior Ronald Melencio 
said. 

Although a majority of the team 
is Japanese, the group is open to 
anyone who is interested in learn-

will be very proud 
of how far they've come,"Monte 
Kawahara, an Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior said. 

Kawahara, who has been play-
ing taileo since he was six, has also 
played in the well-Icnown San Jose 
Taileo group. In addition to playing 
in the background of Asayake 
Taiko, he serves as a technical advi-
sor to the group, drawing on his 
experiences to help members learn 
proper form, rhythm and perfor-
mance techniques. 

"It's fun and inspirational to 
see the beginning of the group, 
how motivated everyone is, and 
watching the growth and 
improvements along the way," 
Kawahara said. 

The group has received suppon 
from NSU and has also received 
performance requests from UCSD 
music classes. 

Now equipped with real drums 
and performance venues, the 
members of Asayalee Taileo are 
loolcing forward to the future of 
the team. 

"I have high aspirations for this 
group," Bobby Koga, a co-founder 
of the team who just graduated 
from UCSD said. "Each individual 
in this group has contributed 
immensely -... within the next year 
I really see taileo becoming a popu-
lar attraction throughout the stu-
dent body, as they are on many 
other UC campuses. I would defi-
nitely like to see its influence 
throughout San Diego."

Vegetarian 
By HANS FELLMANN 

Contributing Writer 

Being a vegeurian on campus 
presents the hassle of finding a 
good meadess meal on campus. All 
too often at UCSD restaurants, 
vegetarian dishes take a back seat 
in both quality and quantity to 
greasy meat-based meals, leaving 
vegetarians with limited options. 
Despite this fact, decent w.getarian 
meals can be found at some of the 
rest2urants that accept meal points 
on campus. If you're willing to sac-
rifice the convenience of your local 
college restaurant and explore 
some other options, you may be 
pleasantly surprised. 

At Eleanor Roosevelt CoUege, 
Cafe Ventanas serves a wide vari-
ety of vegetarian pastas at reason-
able prices. Among them are fet-
tuccini alfredo, ricotta stuffed 
shells in marinara sauce, three 
cheese ravioli, manicotti and veg-
etarian lasagna. These dishes are 
all rotated daily and can be 
accompanied with a fresh piece of 
garlic bread or a side salad. Other 
side items such as beans, rice, 
med rice, chow mein and soups 
are never prepared with beef or 
chicleen bases and could serve as 
meals on their own. Juices, such 
as Odwalla and Sobe, mae a 
meal complete and are also avail-
able at Ventanas. 

Grove Caffe in Student 
Center, which will soon accept 
meal points, serves not only veg-
etarian sandwiches such as the 
tomato, mozzarella, basil, and 
brie and pesto, but also a number 
of vegetarian and vegan soups. 
These include minestrone, curry 
lentil, potato squash, navy bean 
and seven-bean barley.

"I personally enjoy the pasta 
special - especially the lasagna 
and manicotti," Thurgood

an affordable option for those 
running low on meal points.

Can a designated driver 
drink even a little alcohol? ~ I CROSSWORD 
To y'our 
health 

Neha Singh 
Is it safe to drink a little at a 
pany and still be a designated 
driver? Also, how can you recog-
nize alcohol poisoning in I per-
son? 

- Anonymous, 
John Muir College 

Contrary to popular belief, it is 
not at aU safe to have a drinle or two 
and'stiU be the designated driver at a 
party. The California Blood Alcohol 
Concentration limit is 0.08 percent 
if you are over 21. If you are under 
21, you cannot go over the 0.01 per-
cent BAC level. Keep in mind that it 
takes about three hours to eliminate 
the alcohol content of two drinIcs, 
depending on your weight. Nothing 
can speed this process up - not even 
coffee or cold showers. 

"The best bet is to stick to the 
definition of a designated driver 
and not drink at all," Lupe 
Samaniego-Kraus, a health educa-
tor and an alcohol, tobacco and 
drugs prevention coordinator at 
Student Health Services said. "It is 
so difficult to Icnow how much you 
should drinle before you will be 
drunk. There is also the factor of 
someone changing their minds and 
wanti ng to leave the party earl ier." 

Even having a few beers before 
driving can be fatal, since a 12-ounce 
beer has the same amount of alcohol 
as a standard shot of SO-proof liquor 
(either straight or in a mixed drinlc) 
or five ounces of wine. Drinlc:ing and 
driving can have serious conse-

quences, including &ta1 accidents or 
losing your license. 

Even if you are not the desig-
nated driver, it is a good idea to 
space out your drinlcs. 

"The best bet is to have one drinle 
an hour," Samaniego-Kraus said. 
"Also, try to have food as well. 
Spacing the drinIcs out with water is 
good, especially since alcohol causes 
the body to become dehydrated." 

Excessive drinking can lead to 
alcohol poisoning. whic~ can result 
in death if not treated immediately. 
The Student Safety Awareness 
Program at SHS stresses that if 
your friend is not responsive, their 
skin tone is bluish or their breath-
ing is irregular or stopped, you 
must talee action and call 911 
immediately. If your friend is 
passed out, but can be woken up, 
you should put them on their side, 
give them water and stay with 
them. In any case, do not ever leave 
a friend alone when they are drunlc, 
and do not let them sleep it off. 

There are a number of services 
ready to answer any more alcohol-
related questions you might have on 
campus. Visit SHS at hrtp:llstu-
dmtbtlllth.ucsd.tdu or by calling them 
at (858) 534-3874. If you have gen-
eral questions about alcohol, visit the 
Student Safety Awareness Center at 
hrtp:/lucsd.tdulSSllP, or call them at 
(858) 534-5793 . If you had a bad 
experience under the influence of 
alcohol and need to spealc to some-
one, call Psychological and 
Counseling Services at (858) 534-
3755 for an appointment, or visit 
their Web site at

14 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Marriage: Benefits to be reviewed 
continued from page I 

domestic parmers. 
The charter was passed after a 

motion to pull the item from com-
mittee failed, forcing the council 
to adopt the internal committee's 
recommendation to pass item. 

Approval for· the charter comes 
weeks after the council approved a 
resolution that opposed amending 
the U.S. Constitution to ban gay 
marriage. 

"T here 's a lot of criticism any 
time A.S. passes a resolution," 
Gonzales said. "There's some 
arguments that a resolution' does-
n't amount to anything, but it 
means a policy change ." 

According to the charter, the 
task force would "promote the 
council's ability to effectively 

'operate and better serve" UCSD 
students . 

Task force members will 
research the various poLicies relat-
ed tQ marriage and domestic pan-
ners specific to the UCSD campus. 

"With the resolution as a foun-
dation, the task force was created 
as one of many ways to tackle this 
issue of serving an underserved 
communi ty on campus," Gonzales 
said. "It will review policies at 
UCSD that give benefits in the 
realm of m arriage." 

According to Gonzales, while 
policies granting benefits to mar-
ried couples and domestic part-
ners are governed by UC sys-
temwide standards, variance exists 
between different campuses, espe-
cially in the area of housing and 
financial aid. 

"The task force's duty will be, 
in a policy level, to quantify the 
inequa liti es between domestic 
partnership and marriage policies 
and how these policies affect the 
educational mission of the univer-
sity," Gonzales said. 

The task force will also evalu-

ate any impact that would result 
from changing these policies, par-
ticularly if a constitutional 
amendment that would define 
marriage as a union .between a 
man and a woman, were to pass. 
The task force is expected to give 
a report to the A.S. Council 
regarding their findings during 
seventh week. 

"The 6rst part of report win 
show that the inequalities in those 
bene6ts are bad," Gonzales said. 

" With the resolution as a foundation I the task farce 
was created as one of 

many ways to tackle this 
issue of serving an 

underserved community 
on campus." 

- Daniel Gonzales. 
AS. Student AfIinnative Action 

Committee Representative 

" [In the] second part, we want to 
show that if we were to remove the 
domestic pannership policies in 
the university, which the marriage 
amendment would do, that it 
would be a hindrance to the edu-
cational mission of the university." 

Members of the task force will 
be appointed by the A.S. president 
with confirmation from senators. 
According to A.S. President 
J eremy Paul Gallagher, the task 
force will also be able to find ways 
to improve current policies. 

"I think the imponance [of this 
task force) is to not only to protect 

The 
oos 

and maintain the current bene6ts, 
bur also evaluate them to see 
where it can be improved," 
Gallagher said. 

Gallagher said that he hoped 
to submit names of members to 
the council by April 14. 

According to some, the bene-
fits provided to married couples 
and domestic partners is an issue 
that pertains to many people on 
campus. 

"This issue is something that is 
currently affecting lives, the lives 
of our parents, aunts and uncles," 
Gallagher said. "This directly 
affects a huge percentage of our 
campus. We need to research this 
as much as we can." 

Others, however, said that 
researching the issue would be 
limited with the creation of the 
task force . Revelle Sophomore 
Senator Ashley Aluisi said that she 
feels research on the issue should 
have taken place before the A.S. 
Council passed a resolution sup-
porting same-sex marriages. 

"1 do not believe a task force is 
necessary at all ," Alui i said. "In 
fa ct, I feel that a task force of this 
nature limits the type and volume 
of research that needs to be con-
ducted." 

The marriage amendment 
endorsed by President George 
W. Bush would require a two-
thirds majority in each house of 
Congress and must be ratified by 
38 states. 

"We have queer students on 
campus, and marriage directly 
affects the livelihood and contin-
ued participa tion of students on 
campus," Gonzales said. "A.S. is 
in a position to put together this 
task force ... seeing that we have 
this A.S. policy resolution, we 
need to be proactive and tadele 
the issue."

Iraq: College Republicans 
advocate 'perseverance' 

\ 
contimled from page I 

according to CoUege Republican 
members. Each flag served as a 
memorial for 5,000 Iraqi deaths of 
an overall 400,000 to 500,000 
deaths, according to College 
Republican members. Members 
claimed that this statistic is "con-
servative and deflated" and that the 
actual number of deaths is closer to 
one million.

Members said that they were 
not supporting the war itself 
through the event, and that their 
main goal was to commemorate the 
Iraqis who have died and to 
encourage awareness of the signifi-
cance of the "fall of Baghdad." 

"We're not trying to represent 
the Iraqi people; we just want to

Others expressed that the 
College Republicans and all organi-

MONDAY, APRIL 12, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 15 

Water polo: Once distant CCAA playoff berth for UCSD becoming reality 
coruinued from po,e 20 

ond sudden-death period. 
The Tritons subdued UC Santa 

Barbara for three quarters, aided by 
a pair of goals from junior driver 
Jessica Wong that provided a safe, 
if only momentary, cushion, before 
the Gauchos finally wresded the 
lead away with two quick strikes at 
the beginning of the fourth . 

With the weekend split, the 
Tritons remain below .500 at 12-16 
with only five games left in the regu-
lar season. The twl)-week period of 
rest following a 2 -I performance at 
the Loyola Marymount tournament 
on March 26 and March 27 saw the 
Tritons drop 6ve spots in the nation-
al rankings despite some strong, yet 
down-to-the-wire, performances 
against unranIced Redlands and Cal 
State San Bernardino. 

Despite anomalies in the 
records, however, the Tritons are 
in position for a second seed in 
the upcoming Women's Western 
Water Polo Association champi-
onships. At 4-2 in conference play, 
UCSD holds a one-game advan-
tage over rival UC Davis, includ-
ing a Feb. 21 head-to-head win 
over the Aggies, who are 4-3 in 
the WWPA. Since UC Davis has 
concluded its regular season, it 
would take at least a UCSD loss to 
UC Santa Cruz, whom the 
Tritons easily dispatched 14-4 in a 
Feb. 21 match, at the Long Beach 
State Invitational on April 17 and 
a lot of finger crossing for the 
Aggies to get the nod. The bene-
fits of such as scenerio are an eas-
ier first-round opponent followed 
by a possible and highly probable 
rematch between tile two schools 
in the semifinals. Loyola 
Marymount will claim the top 
seed, with a 6-0 conference 
record. 

Strong defense has carried the 
Tritons so far in 2004, but, as dis-
played against UC Santa Barbara, 
UCSD can still have its armor 
pierced in certain situations. 
Struggling to penetrate a strong 
barrier at two-meters, led by 
senior two-meter defender Meris 
Bantilan-Smith, the Gauchos 
were forced to take to the air, fir-
ing shots from seven and eight 
meters out that found their way 
into the cage, and in two quick 
instances, demolished a lead 
steadily built up by four goals 
from Wong and junior utility Tobi 
Lyman. 

UC Santa Barbara's Sarah 
Kovach and A1aina Whitaker par-
layed their long shots into two 
goals at the start of the fourth quar-
ter, breaking a deadlock and giving 
the Gauchos their 6rst lead of the 
game, a decisive 6-4 advantage. 

"[UC Santa Barbara) had some 
good shooters that made some 
good shots that went in, bad 
angled shots. When you're play-
ing good teams, you can't make 
mistakes," said UCSD head coach 
Larry Sanders. 

The Tritons nearly saw their 
advantage depleted even sooner 
when UC Santa Barbara's Mica 
Bell, in response to Wong's sec-
ond goal tallied twice by the 2:32 
mark in the third quarter to equal-
ize. 

"There's nothing negative you 
can say about our defensive per-
formance," Sanders said. 
"Sometimes there's nothing you 
can do. We were running our 
defense and taking calculating 
risks." 

UCSD defense was its stalwart 
self against Cal State San 
Bernardino keeping the Coyotes 
within one goal throughout a

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Innocence of baseball still intad 
Pastime strong, despite controversies 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 
The news is filled with 

steroids, drug testi ng, revenue 
sharing, arbitration, greedy play-
ers and greedier owners, but 
despite all that, baseball will 
always be a game of innocence to 
me. 

I guess my naivete comes 
from my childhood. My best 
friend from elementary school 
was a kid from my tee ball team 
named Jojo who just showed up 
at my house one day with his 
glove and a ball and asked me if! 
wanted to play catch. For a six-
year-old who loved baseball, 
such a gesture was tantamount to 
instant friendship . It turned out 
that Jojo lived JUSt a block away 
from my house, and so the two of 
us - along with another neigh-
borhood kid named Josh -
would spend countless summer 
hours in the backyard playing 
three-way whiffle ball with invis-
ible base runners and without a 
neutral umpire, which led to 
more than a couple pretty heated 
arguments where somebody 
went home mad. But they always 
came back the next day because 
there was always another game to 
be played , and who better to play 

it than us? 
At some point we discovered 

the home run derby, which on 
really hot days was somewhat 
more appealing than all this 
running the bases stuff. Plus, it 
was a lot less work for the invis-
ible base runners to do. My 
backyard was never very big, 

and so even with whiffle balls 
and plastic bats we had to insti-
tute some ground rules so that 
we wouldn't lose too many balls. 
First of all, left field was off-lim-
its. The shape of the yard made 
it too easy to hit it out to left, and 
besides that, Clyde - the neigh-
bor on that side - didn't like 
kids climbing over his fence to 
retrieve balls. That's not to say 
that we didn't do it, but we tried 
to make sure he wasn't home 
before we did. 

My neighbor on the right field 
side was Keiko. After we knocked 
on her door a couple dozen times 
asking if we could go get our ball, 
she told us that we could come 
through her side gate whenever 
we wanted. She instantly became 
my favorite neighbor. On top of 
that, she had a daughter named 
Nancy who was a couple years 
older than my friends and I. 
Every once in a while, Nancy 
would do some sunbathing in her 
backyard. Needless to say, on 
those days there was less argu-
ment about who had to go 
retrieve the ball. 

There was, of course, the wall 
of bamboo to deal with in Keiko's 

yard if the ball made it over the 
fence, but even making ·it to the 
bamboo was no small task. There 
is a giant weeping willow that sits 
near the center of my backyard, so 
any ball hit too hard and tOO high 
would be knocked down by the 
branches and dropped harmlessly 
back onw the grass. I loved and 
hated that tree, depending on 
whose potential home run it 
ruined. 

Those were my summer days. 
Playing baseball, eating lunch 
and then playing more baseball . 
It wasn't just playing, though. 
My mom insists that I learned to 
read because I wanted to be able 
to read the sports page while eat-
ing breakfast. In the evenings, I'd 
often retreat to my room to lis-
ten to Hank Greenwald broad-
cast the Giants game as I fell 
asleep. My day was filled from 
morning until night with a game 
that filled my summen as a kid, 
so it's no wonder that I still love 
it to this day. 

Unfortunately, I don't have 
the space to tell you about the 
radio I saved up to buy so I could 
listen to Giants lames, how the 
Bay Area rule the b~seball 
world in '89, how the strike in 
'94 broke my heart, or how I 
nearly knocked myself uncon-
scious trying to be Kevin 
Mitchell. Baseball may not be 
what it was to me as a kid; but no 
matter how much the game 
changes, to me it is still a game of 
innocence. 

Softball: Powerful bats push Tritons in win 
continued from page 20 

Melanie Meurer was the lone 
Triton to cross the plate, going 1-
for-2 for the day, while senior sec-
ond baseman Kim Aggabao went 
l -for-3 to add the second hit. 

"T he highlight of [the Point 
Lorna doubleheader] was that 
both our pitchers pitched really 
great games, and that was some-
thing that was lacking in our tour-
nament last week," head coach 
Patti Gerckens said. "Our pitch-
ing staff definitely came back 
strong, so that was great to see. 
Our hitting, our bats, were nonex-
istent; we needed to get it all 
together." 

UCSD was finally able to get it 
all together as they started their 
doubleheader against Grand 
Canyon with a 5-3 victory at 
home on April 10. 

Starting pitcher Rowe went the 
distance, earning her eighth win of 
the season, and her first win since 
returning from a back injury. Her 
season record is now 8-5. 

The sleeping dragon that was 
the Triton's offense during the 
week finally awoke from its slum-
ber, as UCSD jumped to a quick 
three-run lead in the first inning. 
Mettee started the game off with 
a bunt single and then stole sec-
ond base. The next batter, sopho-
more shortstop Desiree 
Franciscus, hit a bomb to center 
field, her second home run of the 
season, making it 2-0. Bland then 
doubled in junior catcher Jamie 
Hurst for the third run. Hurst 
and Bland struck again in the 
third inning when they started 
the inning off with back-to-back 
homers, their fourth and second 
of the season, respectively. 

"Today was awesome in the 
fact that we had four home runs, 
which was what we were doing in 
the beginning of the season. We 
were just really back offensively, 
and our pitchers did a good job 
too," Gerckens said. 

The second game of the dou-
bleheader was a nail-biter, with 

the Tritons pulling off a 7 -6 victo-
ry, despite late home runs by the 
Antelopes. Bland threw a com-
plete game, giving up five earned 
runs, and improved her record to 
11-10. 

UCSD dropped to a quick 2-0 
deficit after the flfst inning, but 
exploded onto the scene in the 
third, scoring five runs. The 
inning started with back-to-back 
singles by Mettee and Franciscus. 
Aggabao then advanced them over 
with a sacrifice bunt, setting up 
sophomore leftfielder Jenny 
Spencer. Spencer came through 
with a hit to Grand Canyon's sec-
ond baseman, who failed to make 
the play, resulting in Mettee and 
Franciscus scoring. Hurst then 
singled, bringing up Bland, who 
blasted a three-run shot to right 
field, her third of the season and 
second of the day. 

The Tritons put two more on 
the board in the fourth inning, 
which began with' a Mettee single 
and a Franciscus double. 

Aggabao's sacrifice bunt, which 
was misplayed by Grand Canyon, 
scored Mettee. This set up 
Spencer for a deep sacrifice fiy, 
scoring F ranciscus. 

"It's been a tough couple 
weeks, and we've had to do a little 
bit of soul searching and focusing 
of our goals," Gerckens said. 
"We've been going bade to funda-
mentals in practice, and just let-
ting it all out and showing our 
emotions and showing our frus-
trations to a point where right 
now we're either going to sink or 
swim. We really had to go back to 
what we were doing right at the 
beginning of the year and know 
that the ability was there and we 
could make a comeback. This 
week we really searched hard." 

After the games, the Tritons 
record moved to 23 -19 on the sea-
son. UCSD will take the field 
again on April 16, when they play 
a doubleheader against CCAA 
opponent Cal State San 
Bernardino.

.Tritons: Young team sho'Ying 
postseason promise 

continued from ~ 15 
ened and eventually took the lead, 
UCSD continued to push for the 
equalizer. Lyman hit her second 
score with less than five minutes 
left to cut UC Santa Barbara's 
lead to 6-5, but couldn't come up 
with a tying goal or respond to 
Jennifer D'Anna's second goal of 
the match. 

With the regular season wind-
ing down, look for the nitons to 
begin making a final push toward 
consistency in their strong 
defense while shoring up ' on 
offense and strengthening their 
avenues of attaclt.. The Thtons 

round out their home schedule on 
April 16 at Canyonview Pool, 
hosting crosstown nemesis San 
Diego State at 6 p.m. in the sec-
ond annual Harper Cup. They 
will complete their regular season 
at the Long Beach . State 
Tournament, squaring off against 
UC Santa Cruz in a key WWPA 
match, which will decide whether 
the nitons will earn a 2004 
WWPA playoff seed. The 'Ilitons 
will then tab on Hawaii on April 
17, and will be bosting the Long 
Beach State 49'ers and the 
University of Pacific TIgers on 
April 18 in Long Beach, Calif. 

MONDAY, APIW. 12,2004 THEUCSDGUARDlAN . 

Volleyball:. UCSD can't hold onto CSUN 
condnutd from PDf' 20 

Gauchos defense brob down on a 
hitting error, which tied the match, 
I-I. 

UCSD wasted no time in the 
third game as the Tritons ucelled 
past the Gauchos to a 6-2 lead, a 
margin that would stand through-
out the match as UCSD buried its 
opponent, 30-22, giving the 
Tritons a 2-1 advantage . . 

The Gauchos retaliated with a 
fierce 7-2 lead in the fourth game 
before the Tritons called a time-
out to collect themselves. Upon 
returning to play, UCSD ripped 
into the UC Santa Barbara lead 
and shredded it to a 27 -point tie 
game. A hitting error against both 
teams elevated the score to 28-all, 
before a pair of critical kills by the 
Gauchos tied the contest, 2-2, and 
forced a deciding fifth game. 

In the final game, UC Santa 
Barbara scored fint, but the teams 
stayed within two points until the 
Tritons struck a 13-10 lead in the 
abbreviated, first-toolS-points 
game. The Gauchos tried to com-
pose themselves with a timeout, 
but UCSD immediately began to 
boil again by scoring and moving 
to a 14-10 game point. The 
Gauchos would not let the match 
fall so easily, and took back a pair 
of points, raising the stakes to 14-
12. 

UCSD head coach Ron Larsen 
called a timeout before sicking his 
Tritons on UC Santa Barbara. 
Jones set the ball to junior outside 
hitter Adam Toren for the kill. 

Toren rounded out the contest 
with a match-lligh 21 kills, nine 
digs and five blocks. Waller posted 
19 kills, leaving him 18 kills shy of 
the UCSD all-time record. 
Sophomore outside hitter Jeff 
Urton turned in 16 kills. 

The key elements that aided 
the Tritons to victory included 
outblocking the Gauchos 16.5-11, 
with a kill percentage of .303 ver-
sus the Gauchos .222. The win 
propelled the Tritons to the great-
est single-season conference 
record in school history, 4-16, rel-
ative to a previous best of two 
wins. 

On April 10, the Tritons were 
unable to muster the same intensi-
ty against Cal StJte Northridge. 
In games one and two, the 
Matadon started near-even with 
the Tritons, though they slowly 
crept away with wins, 30-25, and 
30-24, respectively. 

• Even Waller, who had been 
expected to top the all-time UCSD 
kills record at the game, was strug-
gling and looked as though be 
would not meet the task for the 
duration of the opening pair of 
games, having only been awarded 
only six kills. 

The Triton offense that came 
out for game three was virtually 
unrecognizable by comparison to 
the previous games. The score 
was tight throuKh 11 points per 
side, until UCSD exploded on the 
opposition for a 4-0 scoring drive 
to tala: a 15 -11 lead. A string of 
three 3-0 runs by the Triton 
offense dispelled any beliefs of a 
Matador sweep at RIMAC, as 
UCSD pulled away with a 30-23 
victory in the third game, still 
trailing 2 -I overall. 

While the Tritons as a whole 
faced difficulty playing with Cal 
State Northridge in the fourth 
game, Waller was supported by a 
strong offense, feeding him the 
assists be needed to breach his 
18th kill of the evening and secure 
his name in the UCSD men's vol-
leyball history books. He would 
go on to make two more kills in 

the 30-21 loss, (or a total o( 1,271, 
breaking the record set by Tom 
Black, who played at UCSD 
between 1993 and 1996 and is 
now the fint-year assistant coach 
at the University of Southern 
California. 

Urton contributed an additional 
13 kills, and senior middle Kevin 
Keyser put up nine kills on .467 
hitting, plus a match-high seven 
blocks. Freshman setter Brooks 
Dierdortf delivered 40 assists on 
the game. 

With the loss, the Tritons fall 
to 8-19 overall, 4-17 in the 
MPSF, and will not qualify for 
postseason play. UCSD returns to 
action at RIMAC Arena on April 
13 for a match against California 
Baptist University, which beat the 
Tritons Jan. 16 at California 
Baptist, 3-1. The Lancers are 19-
3 this season.

In fourth 
OT, water 

polo takes 
Coyotes 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Staff Writer 

The No. 19 UCSD women's 
water polo team logged in double 
duty in a weekend series at 
Canyon view Pool, pushing 
through four quarters of overtime 
before finishing off Cal State San 
Bernardino, 6-5, on April 10. 
However, on April II, the Tritons 
let an early 3-0 advantage slip 
away to No. 12 UC Santa Barbara 
in a 7-5 decision. 

It was a tug-of-war weekend 
for UCSD, which stood its ground 
firmly, save for the few missteps 
that made or broke each game. 
UCSD and Cal State San 
Bernardino pulled the momentum 
back and forth, trading the lead 
four times, including twice in the 
second period, before redshirt 
freshman two-meter Natalie 
Hockett ended the marathon with 
less than a minute left in the sec-

Cioinl yard: The UCSD women's softball team faced off against Point Lorna 
and Grand Canyon in a pair of doubleheaders between April 7 and April 10, 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD competed in cwo dou-
bleheaders this week, falling short 
in both games at Point Loma 
Nazarene, on April 7, and sweep-
ing a pair against California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
opponent Grand Canyon 
University at UCSD on'April 10. 

The Tritons started their set 
against Point Lorna by losing a 
heartbreaking pitchers' duel, 1-0. 
Freshman hurler Tina Rowe 
failed to receive any run support, 
suffering her fifth loss of the sea-
son and bringing her record to 7-
5 on the year. 

UCSD's offense only managed 
four hits in the game, with two 
coming from senior third base-

man Amy Mettee, who went 2-
for-3. Sophomore rightfielder 
Niki Anderson and junior first 
baseman Jamie Hurst were the 
only other Tritons to get base 
hits. 

The second game against 
Point Lorna felt like deja vu, 
with both pitchers again turning 
in noteworthy performances, 
ending in a 2-\ UCSD loss. 
Senior Jodie Bland hurled a 
complete game and suffered her 
10th loss of the season, despite 
giving up only cwo earned runs. 
The loss put her season record at 
10-10. 

The Tritons put up only two 
hits in game cwo. .

Men's baseball comes back to beat Point Lorna 
Tritons set sights on redemption of tarnished record 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

After a difficult weekend at 
UC Davis April 2 through April 
4, the UCSD baseball team 
bounced back with a non-confer-
ence victory on April 7 over 
fourth-ranked crosstown rival 
Point Lorna Nazarene. The 
Tritons came from behind to eam 
a 7-4 victory over the Sea Lions. 
UCSD improved to 26-26 overall 
and remain 15-13 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

"Our goal was to put a tough 
weekend at UC Davis behind us 
and focus on the next task at 
hand, and we did that," UCSD 
head coach Dan O'Brien said. 
"While I'm proud of the way the 
team bounced back, I'm certainly 
not surprised. nne team is) a 
committed and determined 
group." 

Triton sophomore pitcher 
Byron Grubman, who threw a 
complete game against Point 
Loma at Petco Park earlier in the 
season, started on the hill for 
UCSD. In this second meeting, 
Grubman faced 13 Sea Lion bat-
ters and I've up three runs 
through two and two-thirds 

mmngs. Fellow sophomore 
pitcher Jose Navarro came on in 
the third and threw five innings 
of solid baseball. With the win, 
Navarro improved to 4-2 on the 
season and sophomore closer 
Ryan Leake earned his third save. 

Down 3 -I through four and a 
half innings, the UCSD offense 
picked up and put up three runs 
in the bottom of the fifth. Junior 
rightfielder Ryan Langone dou-
bled to center field and advanced 
to third on a balk to open the 
inning. With one out, junior 
shortstop Keith Hernandez drew 
a walk and advanced to second on 
a wild pitch. Senior first baseman 
Jeff Riddle then doubled down 
the left field line and scored 
Langone and Hernandez. With 
two outs, freshman designated 
hitter Brian Trump singled to 
left-center field and scored 
Riddle, giving the Tritons a 4-3 
advantage. 

UCSD scored a single run in 
the sixth inning and two more in 
the bottom of the eighth to 
secure the victory. 

Though the Sea Lions 
attempted a comeback in the top 
of the eighth inning, they were
