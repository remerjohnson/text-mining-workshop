Professor Resigns 
LINCOLN, Neb. - A Uni-
versi ty of Nebraska-Lincoln 
professor resigned last 
Thursday, cla iming that pre-
vious sex ual harassment was 
forcing her 10 leave. Valerie 
Schwehach, an ass istant pro-
fessor of political science 
since 1994, fi led a formal 
sexual harassment complaint 
aga inst the university in June 
1997, a complaint whidl she 
believes was not handled 
properly hy the university. 
Schwehach 's resignation 
comes one week after the 
Daily Nebraskan uncovered 
a report by the univers ity's 
Academic Senate, which 
detailed sexual harassment 
within the department and 
described its environment as 
one that "tolcrates" harass-
ment. Schwebach and the 
committee 's claims contra-
dict the beliefs of many 
political sc ience professors, 
who say that the department 
has been active in handling 
sexual harassment com-
plaints.

Commencement Controversy 
By Julia Kull.Mader 
Co-News Editor 

Warren College Writing Program Senior 
Learning Skills Counselor Robert McDonell 
has spent the last week camping outside of the 
Chancellor's complex on strike. He serves as 
a visual symbol of the di scontent sparked by 
the choice of Newt Gingrich as this year 's all-
campus commencement speaker. 

McDonell has been at UCSD for 25 years. 
He received a B.A. in literature in 1976, was 
a graduate student in comparative literature 
until 1982, and has since worked for the War-
ren College Writing Program. 

"My initial reaction was a kind of compla-
cency we all experience when the administra-
tion does something unilaterally : 'Well , 
they've done it again,'" McDonell said. "But 

in the following days it came to grate on me. 
"No teaching I received and no professor 

who taught me would condone this," he con-
tinued. "Gingrich is an enemy of education as 
[ experienced it here at UCSD and as [ under-
stand it to be at its best." 

Chancellor Robert Dynes was on vacation 
and unavailable for comment this week. 

However, Associate Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs David Miller, who served 
as chair of the ad-hoc committee to decide 
whether to have an all-campus commence-
ment, said that Dynes chose Gingrich without 
consulting students because of time con-
straints. 

"The process for selecting commencement 
speakers is not one that 's easily dealt with in

MUSIC: Social Distortion, 
The Roots, D Frost fill bi II for 
evening concert at RIMAe 
By Ryan Olson 
Co·News Editor 

This year's Sun God evening concert will be 
headlined by punk-rock band So 'ia l Distortion. 
Hip-hop group The Roots and local band D 
Frost round out the rest of the concert lincup. 

"This is the single, biggest student event on 
campus," A.S. Festi vals Coordinator Steve 
Robert said. "Basically, it means getting out-
ide, getting a little sun and taking a break from 

the monotony of schooL" 
Both Social Distortion and The ROOfS were 

selected by the Sun God Comll1illee, which 
Roberts said tried to choose bands that repre-
sent students' diverse musical tastes. The com-
mittee narrowed its selections based on cost 
and avai lability before making offers to musi-
cal acts. 

D Frost was selected by the Sun God Com-
mittee in a "Battle of the Bands" contest at The 
Stage at The Pub on April 4. D Frost beat out 
the five other groups performing at that event. 

The evening concert will begin at 7 p.m. on 
the RIMAC Field. Gates will open at 6:30 p.m. 
The concert is free to UCSD students, staff and 
faculty with valid UCSD J.D. 

There are a limited number of non-student 
tickets available for people over the age of 18 
with valid l.D. UCSD students, staff and facul-
ty can purchase these tickets for $10 at the 
UCSD Box Office and at the event. Two non-
student tickets can be purchased with each 
UCSD l.D. 

During the day, there will be more than 90 
food, game and information booths in the Price 
Center Plaza, on the Library Walk and on the 
Sun God Lawn. There will be a five-hour con-
cert in the Price Center showcasing the talents 
of UCSD students. 

Other free activities during the day include a 
balloon artist, a caricaturist, face painting,

Hundreds of students crowded 
the Library Walk and the Price

games, a concert featuring the 
bands Greensboro Lane and 
Clyde's Ride, and a dance by night. 

Upon entering Library Walk, 
attendees were greeted by a ign 
announcing their enterance into Las 
Vegas city limits. A multitude of 
camival booths lined the Library 
Walk during the afternoon, includ-
ing student organizations, a mock-
wedding chapel and a karaoke 
booth. 

Roosevelt freshman Jennifer 
Grady aid the mo t attractive ele-
ment of E.L.V.I.S. wa that "it's 
free. " 

. Grady 's sentiment was echoed 
by other students who attended, 
though some attendees found other· 
aspects equally inviting. 

"A friend of mine is in the dunk 
booth, so [ had to give it a shot," 
graduate student Michael Kostura 
said. 

Some of the game booths had 
the names of famous Las Vegas 
attractions. One such booth was 
Luxor, with a ring tos . The prize 
was candy, "mostly melted choco-
late," the booth host admitted. 

The Chapel of Love had three

dings. The ceremonies, performed 
by Revelle freshman Joe Lake, fea-
tured wedding vows that included 
lines like .... .for richer, for poorer,

At dusk, the casino opened at 
the Price Center Cove. The South 
Market Street Jazz Band enter-
tained gamblers. Chips were 
redeemable for raffle tickets for a 
trip 10 Laughlin, Nev., or a tay at 
the Colonial Inn in San Diego. 

The last activity of the evening, 
the dance, ended in a balloon drop.

Volunteer Time 
DAY: Members of the campus community spend 
Saturday helping through Hands on San Diego 
By Vincent Or ........ 
Staff Writer 

Over 200 people attended the 
seventh annual Hands on San 
Diego on Saturday. The day of 
volunteerism started at the Price 
Center and extended over 19 sites 
throughout San Diego. 

Hands on San Diego is spon-
sored by UCSD's Volunteer Con-
nection, a service of the Associ-
ated Students that helps students 
find local volunteer opportuni-
ties. 

Volunteer Connection Director 
Kim Percival said that Hands on 
San Diego is a day that gives stu-
dents the opportunity to see what 
volunteer opportunities are avail-
able in San Diego. 

from building homes for Habitat 
for Humanity to helping children 
create art at the Children 's Muse-
um/Museo de los Ninos. 

According to Percival, all of 
the agencies with whom the vol-
unteers worked have a good rap-
port with the Volunteer Connec-
tion. Percival specifically looked 
for projects lasting from 10 a.m. 
until 2 p.m. so that the students 
could meet at UCSD al the begin-
ning and end of the day. 

For one volunteer activity, 
called " . want to go to College" 
day, students mentored junior 
high school students at UCSD. 

Third-year Marshall junior

sludent Sovanna Pech took part 

Calling il "an

dents who have 
never volunteered 
before," Percival 
said that 8S percent 
to 90 percent of 
people in atten-
dance were new to 
the Volunteer Con-
nection.

Environmentalist to Visit UCSD 
Noted British consultant Norman Myers is coming to 

UCSD on May 4 at 7 p.m. in the IR/PS Robinson Audi· 
torium to discuss "Environment, Population and Con-
sumption: Time of Breakdown or Breakthrough?" 

Myers is one of the planet's leading environmental 
analysts. His arguments for a major national and Inter· 
national effort to halt accelerating environmental dete-
rioration have innuenced corporations, foundations and 
government lead~rs around the world. 

In 1979, Myers wrote a book called The Sinking Ark 
which holds that species extinction is running rampant. 
Myers argued that extinction is one of the most damag· 
ing ecological impacts caused by people because it is 
irreversible. 

His significant contributions to public environmental 
awareness have been recognized through many awards, 
including a Pew Fellowship in Conservation and Envi· 
ronment and a Gold Medal from the World Wildlife Fund. 

Harvard Biologist Coming to 
Speak at UCSD on Wednesday 

J. Woodland Hastings, a professor of biology at 
Harvard University, will be speaking about biolumi· 
nescence and circadian rhythms on May 6 at 4:30 
p.m. in the Uebow Auditorium, located in the Basic 
Science Building at the School of Medicine. Hastings 
will give William D. McElroy Distinguished Lecture in 
Biology. 

Hastings has spent much of his life studying the 
ability of living organisms to emit light. His interests 

also involve the study of circadian rhythms, a very fun· 
damental but poorly understood system in higher 
organisms. For instance, jet lag is a symptom of dis· 
ruption in human circadian systems. Hastings ' 
research focuses on the basic molecular and cellular 
mechanisms responsible for these rhythms - the bio-
logical clock. 

The biennial William D. McElroy Distinguished Lec-
ture in Biology features a scientific speaker of interna-
tional stature. The program was established in 1980, 
following the retirement of Dr. McElroy as chancellor of 
UCSD. 

Hastings has won many honors and has been 
named a NIH Fellow, NATO Senior Fellow in Science, a 
Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation , and 
a Yamada Foundation Fellow, among other titles. He is 
eo-editor of three books and about 400 full·length pub-
lications in professional journals. 

Professor Mark Iiouka to Read 
Stortes at D.O. Wills Books 

UCSD Professor Mark Siouka will read from his new 
collection of stories, Lost Lake, on June 6 at D.G. Wills 
Books on Girard Avenue in La Jolla. Revolving around 
fishing among three generations of Czech immigrants 
on the shores of New York's Lost Lake, some say Slou· 
ka's style is reminiscent of Faulkner. Siouka 's story, 
"The Woodcarver's Tale " won a National Magazine 
Award in Rction from Harper 's in 1995. For more infor·

Professor David Noel Freedman Leads 
Leningrad Codex Reproduction Project 
REUGION: Scholars 
produce facsimile of the 
oldest Hebrew Bible 
By Annam Manthlram 
Staff Writer 

Rel igious studies Professo r 
David Noel Freedman recently led 
a team of scholars in producing a 
facsimile of the oldest complete 
manuscript of the Hebrew Bible, 
the Leningrad Codex. 

"There are a lot of manuscrip ts. 
but the Leningrad Codex is the old-
est complete r one]," Freedman 
said. 

The project took I 0 years to fi n-
ish. Freedman edited the project, 
and Uni versity of M ichigan Lectur-
er Astrid Beck served as managing 
editor. Photographers were directed 
by Universi ty of Southern Ca lifor-
nia Associate Pro fessor Bruce 
Zuckerman of the West Semitic 

Re~earc h Project, and Mari lyn 
Lundberg and Garth M oller of the 
Ancient Biblical M anuscript Cen-
ter, located in Claremont, also 
helped on the projec t. 

Producing the Leningrad Codex 
required the photographers to work 
long hours shooting the manuscript 
and then developing the fi lm on the 
spot to ensure high quali ty. 

The Leningrad Codex is housed 
in the Russian Library in SI. Peters-
burg (formerly Leningrad), and

seniors. 

"More than anything else, edu-
cation presumes that we have not

McDonell said. "The tendency of 
societies is to remain as they were 
is countereJ in part by the role that 

dates back to 1009 A.D. The fac-

Not only a source of research

According to Freedman, lhe 
Leningrad Codex is also imponant 
to scholars because it is the fines t

ic system developed by the Ben 
Asher family.

said. 

Religious scholars believe that 
the Leningrad Codex was written 
in Cairo, Egypt and then sold to 
someone in Damascus, Syria. In 
1862, Abraham Firkovich, a Jewish 
businessman and a collector of 
ancient manuscripts, donated the 
Leningrad Codex to the Odessa 
Society of History and Antiquities 
in Russia. 

The Leningrad Codex was then 
transferred to the Sl. Petersburg 
Imperial Library, and a few years 
later, to the Russian National 
Library. Little is known about how 
the Leningrad Codex came into

j ust learning facts: it consists large-
ly of learning how to creati vely 
inlerrogate received wisdom so lhal 
change can occur of a progressivc 
or better nature. 

"Newt Gingrich is a rear-guard 
politician of the worst stripe - in 
my view Ihe closest to a fascist in a 
long time," he added . " But that's 
illy opinion. I would grudgingly 
accept his speaking here if gradual-
ing seniors had chosen him." 

McDonell also said he believes 
Dynes invited Gingrich in part to 
raise money for the uni versity 
because UCSD, like other public 
universities. receives insufficient 
federal and state funding. 

"UCSD is now scrambling to 
find research dollars in the wake of 

spoken language. 
They also wanted to develop a way 
of marki ng punctuation. accents 
and lhe musical notes when Ihe text 
was chanted in a synagogue. 

The Ben A sher family devel-
oped the most popular system of 
signs - ca lled thc Masoretic sys-
tem, and it is the same system used 
in the Leningrad Codex. 

Freedman said he gotthc idea to 
produce a facsimile edition of the 
Leningrad Codex from the Makor 
edition, a facsimile of the 
Leningrad Codex done in 197 1. 
According to Freedman, the Makor 
edition was unreadable and difli-
cu It to decipher.

budget and the reduction of funds 
being allocated for all kinds of sci-
entifi c work ," McDonell saiJ. 
"UCSD is hurting for those dollars, 
and Dynes had only that in mind 
when he opened his arms to Gin-
grich." 

Muir sophomore Katie Lane, a 
core member of lhe studenl group 
Diversity in Action, became the 
unofficial spearhead of the ant i-
Gingri ch rnovemenl when she

Monday. May 4. 1998 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

A DIPLOMA MEANS NOTHING WITHOUT GOOD EXPERIENCE 
Editor: 

I was appalled at the ridiculous 
comments made in the article writ-
ten by Jeffrey M. Barker (,Tec hni-
cal Job Market is a Nightmare," 
Guardian, April 27). To suggest 
thai Qua/comm hires foreign 
nationals simply because Ihey are 
cheaper labor and not because they 
are more qualified is sheer bi gotry 
at most. These johs arc not bcing 
"stolen" by anyone, no more than 
admission to UCSD is being 
"stolen" by minorities . Si mply put , 
the most qualified wi ll prosper. 

QlI alcomm's stri~ 1 hiring stan-
dards arc just one of Qualcomm's 
screening lools to incorporate and 
im plement the right people wi th the 
right altitudes and drive to work in 
such a demanding and professional 
work environment. 

Being matric ulaled into a 
demanding fi eld of profession fro m 
a well -known s<.:hool doesn't grant 
that person uncondil ional job 
placement aftcr gradual ion. Not all 
scholars have the right alt itude to 
work as a team and not all sdlO lars 
have the drive il takes to get somc-
Ihing done. A sludenl may he well 
versed in his tex thook exams, hUI 
may be inappropriale in a work 
environment whi ch cn<.:ourages and 
requ ires not onl y learn work bUI 
also Ihe abi lilY 10 communicat e. 

One must ask why top schools ' 
, 1Ich as Harvard, Yale and MIT, 10 
name a few, have such strict screen-
ing proccdures; il is for the same 
reason that Qua/collllll does. Qua l-
comm is not just a work environ-
ment bu t it can also be vi ewed as a 
learning institute similar to that of a 

university. 
Why shouldn 't Qualcomm be 

strict in ils hiring procedures? It is, 
after all , a for-profit institution. The 
su<.:cess of the company is depen-
dent on the hiring of the best and 
brightest. Yet, si mply being lechni-
call y proficient is not the ticket to a 
position in Qualcomm. Qualcomm 
judges a pros pecti ve employee as 
an ind ividual, as an entire package, 
instead of just a technica l data bank. 
Hiring the right employees makes it 
a compelling place to work. 

If you owned a company, you'd 
want to create a work environment 
driven by a group of agg ressive 
individu als who take ownershi p 
and pride in their work. As an 
emplo ee of Qua/comm and a ~tu­
dent at UCSD for the last four 
years, I have found that QuuJcomm 
defin itely provides all of ils 
employees with the "perks" that 
they wa nl. Yet, it isn' l "easy" to get 
into one of the most competitive 
mmpanie~ in San Diego, and Qual-
COI11I11 never implies that it is easy. 

The job market is OUI Ihere for 
computer sciencc engineers, but a 
degree doesn' t gel you in tht! door 
unJcss you can demonslrate that 
you can back it up. 

/I sounds 10 me like someone is 
ve nling his frustration from being 
rcje<.:ted.

fo rmer General Dynamics (a

after graduating from UCSD, one is -
not likely to have a great deal of 
real-world experience. Most com-
panies are looking for employces 
who, in addition to having good 
lechnical abilities, are able to com-
municate well , work with others 
and have some sort of experience in 
management, marketing, etc. 

The most brillianl engineer may 
not be able to share his or her ideas 
with co-workers, and for all intents 
and purposes, thi s employee is far 
fro m being an assel to the company. 

UCSD provides an exceptional 
Iheoretical hackground for its engi-
neering students. However, gai ning 
practical experience is not part of the 
usual curriculum. There are, howev-
er, many opportunit ies for gaining 
expelience on and ofT campus.

Opponents of Proposition 227 say 
this new system is untested and has 
no structure, but these arguments 
are ungrounded. 

Immersion programs are the pri-
mary method of teaching language 
in foreign countries. Students arc 
placed in normal classes, and they,

language quickly and accurately.

especially in light of the untested

It is foolhardy to believe that 
students can master a new language 
in the brief 180 days that Unz and 
his supporters call for. Imagine 
moving to a new country and being 
forced to master a new language in

where the only language spoken 
wasn' t his own. The student will 
tell you that he learned the foreign 
language quickly because he had 
no other choice. 

Immersion programs are also 
used successfully in American high 
schools to teach Engli sh-speaking 
students other languages. I remem-
ber talking to other students at my 
high school who were taking a 
Spanish class in which the teacher 
would not allow any English in her 
classroom. All the students would 
agree the teaching method was dif-
fieu It, but it worked. 

The new immersion program 
that Proposition 227 would set up 
al so has a definite structure. It 
would creatc special immersion 
classes in which the focus would be 
teaching the students English.

We live in the United States of 
America, a counlry that is supposed 
to represent her citizens. 

Americans pride themselves on 
being self-relianl and providing 
freedom of opportunity to all. With 
the claims thai America is a repre-
sentative democracy which is sup-
posed to represent the people, isn't 
it ironic that certain groups contin-
uously wanl LO take the freedom of 
choice oul of others' hands? 

For beller or worse, we are a

These classes would not normally

dents would then be placed in 
mainstream classes. This shortened 
time in special English language 
classes could save school districts 
the money usually spent in exten-
sive years of instruction in bilin-
gual education. 

In contrast to the arguments 
posed by opponents of Proposition 
227, the new program would not 
take away parents' right to choose 
which method of instruction is best 
for their children. In fact, it encour-
ages parents to be involved in thei r 
students' education. 

Proposition 227 would allow 
parents who feel thei r child is not 
learning English well enough to 
transfer their child to a class where 
slhe could learn English more suc-

requires a two-thirds vote of both 
the Assembly and the Senate to 
change - a task that is all but 
impossible to accomplish. 

I am not naive enough to believe 
that the existing bilingual educa-
tion system is adequate. I welcome 
the debate that the Unz initiative 
brings to bilingual education, but 
eliminating existing programs is 
not the answer. Not only is the 
measure risky, but recent events 
have taken the wind out of the sails 
of the anti -bilingual educat ion 
movement. 

Two weeks ago, Ihe stale assem-
bly approved a measure Ihat would 
allow local school districls to estab-
lish Iheir own bilingual -education 
programs. Giving loca l school dis-
Iricts this power is a necessary step. 
The school di strict s hest know the 

waived out of the special immer-
sion classes if they already have 
good Engli sh language skills - or 
are over the age of 10 and a school 
principal and educational staff feel 
an alternate course of study would 
be beneficial to the child. 

Bilingual -education programs 
are the ones that restri ct parents' 
rights to choose. Students arc 
forced into the bilingual-education 
program, and their parents must 
fi ght with the school di stricts if 
they want to place them in other 
English-education programs. 

Opponent s also claim that 
teachers could be sued personally 
for teaching in the children's native 
language to help them learn Eng-
lish. This argument is completely 
false and is a misinterpretation of 
the proposed law. 

Anicle five allows parents to sue 

abilities of the students and can 
best represent the people that they 
are supposed to serve. The state can 
function as an overseer over the 
di strict programs and provide help 
and assistance when necessary. 

Instead of ducking the issue and 
brushing it under the carpet, people 
need to realize that it is not "Eng-
lish for the Chi Idren" that they are 
after. Rather, it is "Education for 
the Children" that Californians 
should be arguing for. 

California 's schools are bad and 
gelli ng worse. Instead of trying to 
lind ways to save the K-12 public 
school system, politicians are 
graspi ng at straws - sheltered

the new law by denying the child 
"the option of an English language

see this as a legal allack on school

Good English-language ski ll s 
are a necessi ty in this country. To 
deny our children the right to learn 
English in the way that is best for 
them is irresponsible. Proposition 
227 would provide not only the 
best possible method for English

parents the right to choose what is

threatening to hold back school

tricts jumping through hoops to

good unless it is followed up with 
action. 

If the people of California could 
be united in a common cause, we 
can tum back the tide of obsoles-
cence and make our schools a better 
environment for learning. The state 
of our education system is one prob-
lem that we cannot hide. 

Instead of looking for the easi-
est way out of the problem, we 
need to get down in the dirt and 
start rebuilding our education sys-

represented racial -minori ty stu-
dents admi tted 10 UCS D for fall 
1998. 

"In recent yea rs, UCSD has 
commilled ilse lf to a ce lebration 
of diversity at all levels of acti vi-
ty," Lane's leiter stated. "Classes, 
student acti vilies, residenti al life 
and campus faci lities have 
explored the breadth of culture 
this campus holds and have 
attempted to create an atmosphere 
that not only mirrors the hetero· 
geneily of American culture, but 
also leads the way in giving voice 
to new schools of thought in a 
variety of areas. 

"We feel that Speaker Gingrich 
and his political record are dia· 
metrically opposed to this endeav· 
or," the letter continues. "Inviting 
an individual who has never 
expressed support for this type of 
progressive education or interest 
in the generation he would be 
addressing is not only offensive 
but a gross disregard for the stu· 
dents this ceremony should be cel-
ebrating." 

Lane said that she is particular· 
Iy offended by the fact that the 
decision to invite Gingrich was 
made with little student input. 

"Everyone is taking this as a 
very political issue. To me it is 
not a political issue," Lane said. 
"Whether or not I agree or di s-
agree with Newt Gingrich's pol · 
icy or politics is beside the mat· 
ter. 

' 'This is an issue of the rights 
of students on thi s campus to have 
a say in what goes on," she con· 
tinued. "This was supposed to be 
an invitation from the student 

body 10 speak al the commence-
ment address and that 's not al all 
what ii 's been." 

Lane stressed Ihal she is not 
angered by the fact that Gingrich 
is coming to campus, hut inslead

VEGAS: Event 
capped off with 
evening dance 
ContInued from .... e 1 
Inside 25 of the balloons were gift 
certificates for various restaurants 
and stores. 

The all-campus event was the 
culmination of the year-long 
Emerging Leaders Program (ELP) 
at Revelle College. This was 'the 
fourth annual ELP event, and the 
fi fth year of the program. ELP stu-
dents organized all aspects of the 
event, including publicity and 
fundraising . 

According to event co-chair 
Shannon Castle, a Revelle fresh-
man, the idea for E.L.V.I.S. 
stemmed from the results of an 
informal student poll that ELP 
members had conducted earlier in 
the year. 

"The event is basically what 
you make it," Castle said. "We 
took some informal polls on cam· 
pus, and this is what students 
wanted." 

E.L.Y.I.S. cost about $13,500. 

according to ELP member Laura 
Tripp, a Revelle freshman. 

According to Castle, the bulk of 
the costs were covered by the Rev-
elle College Council and the Asso-
ciated Students. Castle noted the 
imponance of the A.S. support. 

"[E.L.V.I .S.] wouldn't have 
happened without support from the 
rest of the campus," Castle said. 

Revelle College Dean and ELP 
Director Renee Barnett-Terry said 
the purpose of ELP is to teach stu-
dents "important skills that leaderl 
should leam and develop." 

Barnett-Terry also commented 
on the value of ELP as a lea"ming 
experience. 

"ELP provides a fonnal leader-
ship program for these students," 
she said. 

Throughout the academic year, 
ELP students learn how to 
improve their skills in areas such 
as interpersonal communication, 
public speaking and meeting man-
agement. Students who finish the 
program of len lake on leadership 
positions on campus, such as in

The Editor's Soapbox 
Editor Advises: Forget About the Four-
Year Plan, Enjoy Life and Study Abroad 
By Jonah Nisenson, Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Well , my avid readcr~, the door 
has ope ned, and I must walk 
through. I speak of a new and 
exci ling ex peri ence Ihal looms on 
lhe hori/on. ca lling me, heckon-
ing lo m.: and whispering my 
name. 

I am helples~ againsl it , it 
draws me, pull s me in an 
unknown direction. It crashes over 
me wilh alt ernating waves or 
exc i lement and apprehension. I

forth coming yea r-long study pro-
gram in Pari s. 

I imagine Ihat hall' or you read-
ing thi s soapbox have by thi s time 
lost interest and are qui Ie ready to 
turn the page. You're thinking, 
France, who cares'} It 's all a bunch 
of stinky, ye llow- toothed, non-
shavi ng, I:hain-Mnoki ng Frenchies. 
Please, do me a favor and overlook 
the slereotypil:a l judgments for one 
moment and li sten to what I have to 
say. 

This year began, simi lar to my 
prev ious two years here, in a fren-
zied manner. School started with 
the token first week or slacking. 
Then the booze wore orf, and I real-
ized there were 15 little assign-
ments to eomplete and 500 pages 
of reading to catch up on. In addi-
ti on, I was working two jobs that 
added up to more than 25 hours a 
week. It was little wonder I wasn' t 
a happy camper.

Tent buried under 6 
feet of snow 
Continued from page 11 
lalking about the imminent !irst 
snow of Ihe season. This fir ·t trip 
took on new meaning for me as I 
now saw it as a test agai nst some-
thing indefinah le. 

That storm hrought 2 feet of 
snow in two ni ghts to my tentless 
campsite ancl ob literated any sign 
or a trail Ihat I had been following. 
My decision to forego a tent made 
both nights long, cold and sleep-
less. 

My cockiness and total di sre-
spect for the powers of Mother 
Nature had been compounded fur-
ther by my carelessness. I forgot to 
pack cookware (i .e. pots or pans) 
a~d was unable to cook any of the 
rood I had so carefully chosen to 
bring. 

I went three days trudging' 
through the snow, without sleep, 
with minimal nourishment and 
totally oil-trail. I headed jn the 
direction I thought the highway and 
Lake Tahoe lay. I ate only a few 
carrots and some peanut bulter, 
while my pasta, beans and other 
de lectablcs lay uncooked in my 
pack. 

My !irst lesson or the season 
was one I will not s(xm forget. 
Those two sleepless night s alone 
- under the closcst thing to a tent 
I could make wi th a 6 rlX)t hy 6 foot 
tarp. with snow piling increa ingly 
higher around me - were mentally 
ex hausting. The days ~pent plod-
ding through the snow with numh 
fect and empty stomach physicall y

Ever since I could 
sit on a toilet seat 
without slipping 
through, I have 
longed to travel 
and see the world. 
This Is It; this Is my 
chance. Never 
again will I be able 
to live I n a foreign 
country, learn the 
language, and do It 
for close to the 
same cost as going 
to school at UCSD. 
I speak to you, 
dear reader, who 
has not yet even 
considered the 
option of studying 
elsewhere. Why 
haven't you? 
2,000 pounds of dried mud, that it 
was time for a change. I had been 
taki ng Fren<.:h in anticipation of 
goi ng "broad for my super-senior 
year, but that all changed in a nash. 
Founh-year now sounded just as 
promising as any to throw my 

world into a blender of cultural 
diversily. 

Ever si nce I could si t on a toi let 
~eat without sl ipping through. I 
have longed to trave l and see the 
world. This is it ; thi s is my chance. 
Never again willi he able 10 li ve in 
a roreign country, learn the lan-
guage, and elo it for close 10 Ihe 
same <.:os t as attending UCSD. 

I speak 10 you, dear reader, who 
has not yet even considered the 
option of studying elsewhere. Why 
haven' t you'! Is it the money, is it 
the fact that it might set you back a 
quarler or two - or are you just 
afraid '! 

There are so many scholarships 
to he had that money shou ld not he 
an issuc, not to mention that stu -
dent loans arc adjusted depending 
on yo ur need while abroad. If you 
plan well enough and go to a place 
where you ca n stay on track with 
your four-years-and-oul plan. there 
is nothing to worry about in terms 
of graduating on time. Fear, howev-
er, I cannot tell you to di smiss 
mildly, because it is simply not that 
easy. 

I picture myself walking the 
streets or Paris, stopping at a fruit 
stand to squeeze a few peaches and 
getting my hand slapped by the 
vendor. You see, in France, it i the

look their loll on me. 

Humili ty hefore the powers of 
Mother ature is a lesson almost 
always learned the hard way. A 
friend of mine from high school 
lo. t his father last year on a rather-
son cross-<.:ountry ski trip into the 
Tahoe hack country when a snow 
storm caught them unprepared . 
Luckily for me, hUllli lity caIll~ with 
min im al consequences. 

My suhsequent trips were not as 
eventrul a~ that first trip, and my 
thoughts soon moved from hack-
packing amI climbing to Ihe !lying 
snow and the imminent arriva l of 
the sk i season. 

I got a job tca(; hing skiing to 
children at Squaw Valley. I 
informed Ill y parcnts that my return 
to school in January was look ing 
pretty unlikely, and that I was 
going to stay in Tahoe ror another 
quarler. Thei r response: " ot in our 
place you're not," - a response I 
had anticipated. 

So, I found a house in Tahoe 
City with six other people. Among

them were two Kiwi girls from 
Queenslown, ew Zealand, and a 
recovering crack addil: t/former ski 
racer, from the suburbs of Con-
necticut. 

Teaching kiing to kids blew me 
away. I could never have foresee n 
how mllch work it truly is. kiing 
wilh 12-year-olds who rip - and 
gelling paid for it - is the most 
amazing path to a monthl y pay-
check. Picking crying 4-year-o lds 
off the ground all day and trying to 
make them ~ki, while the rest of 
Taho.: is enjoying the 2 feet of fn.:,h 
,now that fe ll the nighl before, is 

alan's path to a monthly pay-
check. 

Working with kids, ,kii ng and 
gelling paid for it , despi te the occa-
sional days that make you wan I 10 

~ee children banished from this 
earth, proved to be my ideal winter 
job. 

The children gave me insight 
in to myselr, as well . As someone 
who has galien into his share or 
trouble. I had more patience wi th 
Ihose kids when other instructors 
complained: "He docsn' t listen to a 
Ihing" (you prohably weren ' t worth 
li steni ng to) and "He does every-
thing I te ll him not to do" (you 
don ' t let him do anything fun ).

Skiing with 12-year-
olds who rip and 
getting paid for It Is 
Just the most amaz-
Ing path to a month-
ly paycheck. Picking 
crying four year olds 
off the ground all 
day and trying to 
make them ski, 
while the rest of 
Tahoe Is enjoying 
the 2 feet of fresh 
snow that fell the 
night before, is 
Satan's path to a 
monthly paycheck. 

As I sympathized with th.:se 
troublemakers, they al so occasion-
ally prompted me 10 refl ect upon 
my own acti ons. I would think , 
"That really is obnoxious, did I 
used to do that when I W;IS a kid '!" 
Do I still do tha .. } As I helped the 
kids improve thei r skiing and enjoy 
thc mountain, they helped to give 

me insight into myselr. 
With the arrival of the ski sea-

son. Tahoe took on a whole new 
meaning to me. During Ihe months 
of January and Fehruary there were 
only 13 days duri ng which EI Niiio 
fai leelto bring snow. That leaves 46 
slorm days, whi <.: h mcans powder, 
powder. powder and more powder. 

Whi Ie long- time loca ls were

when an alarm clock is supertlu-

senses the powder like a built -in 
yard Slick stu ck in the snow. mea-
suring the falling snow until it too 
is buried beneath the growing snow 
pack. It snows all day, and that

good things. 
Those nights are like Christmas. 

All you want to do is go to sleep so 
you can wake up Ihe next morning. 
But you can't sleep; your heart is 
beating too fast wi th anticipation to 
ever settle down to a rate conducive 
to sleep. 

Bluebi rd powder days come 
after it has dumped and dumped

you wake lip to hlue kies and fre 'h

After scarfi ng down a cup of 
cofTee and a hasty breakfast, I 
wou ld huckle down my boots and 
head for the lift. I would wait impa-

anlicipalion of fresh tracks and big 
air until 9 a.m., when the lirst 
skiers load the chair lift and the 
race for the untouched and deepest 
powder begins.

TAHOE: 
EI Nino buries the 
mountain in powder 
Coi ........ d fr_ ...,. 13 
tracks. 

Everything is like a giant pillow 
just waiting to painlessly catch skiers 
and boarders alike, as they huck 
themselves off every conceivably 
huckable rock. You can do no wrong. 
The powder is so deep you choke on 
it as you ski . It was so deep some 
days that I saw skiers drop 01T large 
rocks and disappear into the snow 
when they landed, waiting for their 
f riend~ to dig them out. 

The best thing about powder 
days, however, is that every skier, 
except those unlucky few stuck 
working, has an car-to-ear grin 
across hi s face. Not a negative 
word or thought is heard all day. 
On Ihose days, any problems or 
troubles in your life disappear deep 
into the fresh powder, and you walk 
away from the mountain with that 
feeling that I like to call "stoked:' 

Your legs are so sore you' ll be 
waddling for the nellt 24 hours, 
your face is sunburned to' a cri sp 
because, in the rush to ge t fresh 

tracks, sunscreen is invariably 
left behind, your lips are chapped 
as chapsti ck, too, is an after-
thought , and your own mOlher 
won ' t lalk to you as you had 
promi sed 10 spend the day skiing 
with her on her lone vi sit to 
Tahoe. "Sorry, mom, no fri ends 
on a powder day." And still , the 
smile never fades. 

As the day winds to a close, sto-
ries told during apres-ski activities, 
usually at the Red Dog Saloon at 
Squaw Valley, keep all your va li ant 
exploits o f the day ali ve. 

While we sat and drank and 
boasted, the nat landers up for the 
weekend from whatever urban set-
ting they sprang, sat entrenched in 
the parking lot traffic (on bad days 
it could take an hour just to get out 
of the parking lot), fru strated 
because they had to return to their 
johs in Silicon Valley and down-
town San Francisco. 

Meanwhile, I look0d forward to 
tomorrow. Possihly another EI Niiio 
treat and more powder, or another 
sunny day (two in a row was rather 
rare) and a chance 10 ex plore the far-
thest reaches of the mountain and 
the hidden caches of untouched 
powder deep in the trees.

M, time off from 
school taught me 
more than school 
could have tauiht 
me In four , ...... I 
am not discounting 
the value of a 
coll.g. education. I 
slmpl, am 
advocating the 
value of educating 
yourself through 
other chann.ls as 
w.ll. To think that a 
compl.te education 
can be found totall, 
within books Is 
nalv. and Ignorant. 

But, all good things must come 
to an end, at least until next winter. 
J must get back to school to earn a 
degree so I can ski all winter, wi th 
no guilt , and then go to where I can 
ski all summer, wi th no guilt. For 
now, the surf and the sun of San 

Diego suits me just fine. I feel 
refreshed about school and am even 
excited to hit the books and look 
forward to my lectures - a rather 
unfamiliar sensation. 

It 's funn y how every cloud 
truly does have a silver lining. In 
Tahoe, the silver lining to the 
sto rm c louds that enve lop the 
mountains is easy to find . It 
comes in the form of snow that 
brings powder days, which bring 
endless smiles. 

The sil ver li ning to my suspen-
sion was more difficult to li nd, but 
even that eventually made its pres-
ence crystal clear. In hindsight, 
things could not have worked out 
beller - except maybe if I had 
done it by choice rather than force. 
That's the way life goes. The best 
things in life often come when you 
least expect them to. 

My ti me 01T from school taught 
me more than school could have 
taught me in four years. I am not 
discounting the value of a college 
education. I am simply advocating 
the va lue of educating yourse lf 
through other venues as we ll . To 
think that a complete edu ation can

I learned a lot over the past six 
months and had some amazing 
experiences. 

I learned what it is really like to 
live in a town where everybody 
knows everyone else. I met people 
from all over the world who were 
in Tahoe to ski - some just for a 
season, others had been there 20 
years and did not look 10 be leaving 
anytime oon_ 

I skied everyday with the hcst ski-
iers I have seen. I met a gi rl who blew 
my mind and heart. I got close to 100 
days of skiing in, and I am still count-
ing. I went bungee jumping for the 
first time (and then the second time) 
in the middle of the night off a 200-
foot train bridge, complete with a dip 
in the river below. I went to a monster 
truck rally. 

I snowshoed into a back country 
meadow somewhere and saw a 
mother black bear with two cubs. I 
climbed back country peaks that 
gave way to 3,000 vert ical feet of 
untracked powder. 

These experiences and lessons 
are deeply etched into my mind and 
won' t ever let me forget how Illany 
awesome th ing this planet has to 
offer those wi ll ing to do a little 
searching and take a few risks.

Don't Expect Vegas At Viejas 
By Marc Comer 
Senior Staff Writer 

If you're ready to gamble (no, 
not on who can keep down the 
grade-D beef from the donm.), then 
take a look at one of San Diego's 
three casi nos that allow anyone I g 
or older to gamble. 

Located j ust east of San Diego 
are tllfe0 La, Vegas-style casi nos, 
owned ancl operated by ative 
Americans. 

Although these casinos arc 
nowhere near the excitement of the 
true La~ Vega~ casin s, thcre aren't 
many other places where an I H-
year-old compulsive gamhler can 
playa good game of hlackjack with 
SOIllC ~enior citil.ens. 

Even for those who are old 
enough 10 gamble in the ci ty thaI 
never sleeps (that would he La, 
Vegas) , why drive six hours 
through thc desert jll~t to en~ountcr 
a scene from the Illovie 
'·Swingers' '', 

If you can tolerate the stench 01 
cigarette smok0 ancl a crowd con-
lined to mainly oldl'f people, San 
Diego's casinos are quite n:a,on-
able. 

T he three casinos, Barona, 
Sycuan and Viejas, o ffer only a 
limited amount of gaming, but it is 
typica lly enough to keep the begi n-
ning gamhler satis li ed. Each casino 
offers hundreds of slot-and-video 
poker machines, numerous gaming 
tab les that offer variations of hlack-
jack and poker and, of course, t hc 
ever-popu lar hingo. And if that 

doesn' t whet your appetite. they 
always have keno. 

Barona, which some of you may 
have seen Kenny Rogers vouch for, 
takes the theme of a eireus tent 
(ent irely original). This casino, the 
second largest of the thr0C, ofTers a 
few card tables with popular games 
such as Ol11aha Hi-La split , Texas 
Hold 'Em and seven-card stud Hi-La. 

1 f, howeve r, you 're the type thut 
likes to go one-on-one wi th your 
opponent , you might want to stick 
to the Jnker~ Wild 21 (like Bla(;k-
jack ), or test you r luck at the 
alwa y, -dangcrous video poker. 

Unlike Las Vegas casi nos, 
Sarona i. very bt:gi nner-f.-iendly; 
its dealers actu all y help you oul. 
This may not be policy, hut it surc 
beats Sam Ihe ace deakr taking you 
for your first -born. 

The ambiance at Barona i~ like 
cas ino nigh t at the Incal sa loon. 
With a majority of people who 
rememher the Korean War lirst-
hand . Barona docs nOl have much 
of a college almosphere. 

SyclIan, the smallest of the three 
casinos, could possibly double for 
an auto-parts warehouse. With too 
many video poker mac hines and a 
poor layout, Sycuan makes gelli ng 
around the ca~i no very diflicuh. 

Wi th many of the same ofTer-
ings as the other two casinos, 
Sycuan is not hing special. The 
casi no docs, however, boast of 
hosti ng such stars as Phylli s Diller, 
America, BJ Thomas, The Turt les, 
Mark Lindsay, the Shirelles and, 

no has the nicest layout, the most 
Vegas- like atmosphere and the 
fewest number of "upscale" clien-
tele when I went. It even had a few 
gamblers under the age of 40. 
Overall , Viejas draws a much nicer 
and less lethargic crowd. 

let in the car so you won 't be 
tempted to jump for the ATM just 
after you hit where you should have 
stayed. Don' t bring much more 
than $50, as you may get bored by 
the time you spend it. 

Although these 
casinos are nowhere 
near the excitement 
of the true Las 
Vegas casinos, there 
aren't many other 
places wh.re an 1& 
year-old compulsive 
gambler can play a 
good gam. of 
blackjack with some 
senior citizens. 

Viejas had the least conva les-
cent scent and the ni cesl envi ron-
ment; everyth ing looked reason-
ahly new. It has a wide variety of 
card tahles and many slo t-and-
video poker Imlchi nes. The restau-
rants at Viejas even looked decent. 
Viejas is, hy fa r, the best of the 
three casi nos. 

In general, the casinos arc worth 
the 30- to 45-mi nute drive for any-
one under 2 1. Like most Las Vegas 
casinos, they offer free drin ks to 
gamblers . The gambl ing is nut 
nearly as int imidating as in Las 
Vegas; they offer many low-range 
bets, even as low as $ 1. 

Though the casinos don't offer 
anything like rou lelle or craps, most 
of the games arc still fun . What's 
most im portant , though, is that the 
casinos are very low-key (i.e., no 
Joe Pesci-looking guy dragging you 
out back by your hair and bludgeon-
ing your face with a phone for 
touching your cards wrong). 

Wear something that you don ' t 
mind smelling smoky - not that 
fresh-smoke sme ll that you can 
handle, hut that dingy, been-linger-
ing-since-we-opened smoke smell . 
J recommend a biosuit. Also, go on 
a weekend . 0 there is no chance 
that you' ll be the only one stuck at 
a table wi th Sall y Jo showing you 
her herniated disk. 

If YOll do decide to go, you might 
want to go now. Governor Wilson is

SOAPBOX: 
A once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity 
ContInued from ..... 12 
sticking your dirty little fingers in 
it, you are not only insulting the 
vendor's judgment but are also 
bruising the fruit. 

I know about this little blunder 
and fortunately will avoid it, but 
how many other mistakes will I 
make as r rush headlong into a for-
eign culture wilh no inclination of 
whom I will pi ss off'? 

It can be a little scary, but it 's 
my opinion Ihat you di scover 
things about yourse lf you never 
knew before. 

If that 's nOl enough . all of you 
who won'l be 21 for a while. think 
of it this way : Most other countries 
set Ihe legal drinking age at 18 or 
below. Something to remember. but 
you didn ' t hear it here. 

What J'm gelling at is thi s - it 
makes me sad to know that so few 
people actually take advantage of 
the opportunity. Just 500 or so of 
the more than 15,000 undergradu-
ates at UCSD go abroad each 
year. 

That's about 3 percent, which is 
just downright pathetic - a piss-
poor turnout of students interested 
in studying abroad. 

The excuses J get range from, "I 
wouldn 't be able to graduate in 
four," to, ''I'm a wu s." The set:ond 
one I can respect . although there is 
no better way to break that wussy 
tendency than to experience t: razy 
pl aces. The in-and-out-in-four 
excuse I don 't buy. Why arc people 
in such a hurry to get OUI in four, to 
join the work force, to join the "real 
world?" 

Guess what, th.: "real world" 
might not he as stimulaling as you 
thi nk . All ow yourself to enjoy it 
here: get into that scuha club you 
always thought you might like, hut 
always had foo mu ch O-Chem 
homework to try it. 

Join that chess c1 uh you thought 
might relieve some stress. Stop 
worrying about money so damn 
much. You would be pained if I iold 
you the dehts I' m paying off right 
now_ 

On a different note, the rea lily 
of being gone for an entire yea r 
hits about midway through spring 
quarter. After all . it will he my 
fourt.h yea r, and th ose of my 
friends who have Iheir li ves more 
together th an I j ust mighl he 
graduat ing (J can only hope they 
decide 10 slack the rest of the 
way and sti ck around unt i I I 
return ). I am sure so me will. 

While I was sitting with one of 
my hest fr iends the other day, he 
brought lip the fact that we won' t 
see I!ach other for over a year. It 
was then that the lirst inkling of 
sadness crept into my soul . with the 
rea liLlltion that good-hyes arc just 
around the hend before Pari s, grand 
Pari s. 

I started thinking about all the 
timcs I've had hcre, good and bad. 
The trouble I've sought out -
unintent ionall y of course - and 
the Irips I' ve taken wi th fr i end~ _ All 
have left thei r marks on m.: - even 
the tillles with an unlikely group of 
guys Ihat somehow callle together 
to form the sport s staff at the 
Guardian . 

I wi ll leave a lot behind , hut I 
have an equal amount to look for-
ward to. So wi th that in mind. t:on-
sider going ahroad for a year. or

Minnesota is Calling Tritons 
CRUNCH-TIME: At the Steve Scott Invite at UC lrvine, UCSD continues to 
pile up natjonal qualification marks as the National meet gets closer 
By Saul Sheridan 
Staff Writer 

The clock is ticking. With the 
~eason winding down to a precious 
few meels, thi s weekend was one 
of the I"st opporlUnities 
for many of the Tri ton ath· 

l e t e~ to improve their incli-
vidual performance, and 
to ,et new per~onal 
rel:ords. This weekend, the 
UCSD track and fie ld 
tea lll traveled to UC Irvi ne 
to I:Olllpete in the Steve 
Scott Invitat ional. 

This w mpetilion wa, a time to 
take all the knowledge garnered 
this year and all the hard work put 
In and turn it int o a hig· time perfor-
mance. 

Many Tri tons did just that. a~ 
perso n,,1 reco rds am] Na ti onal -
qua li fying marks were turned in hy 
several clutch Tritons. 

Among those who put in hig-
time performances thi s weekend 
were women's I.:iOO-meter di,-
lance runncr~ ounney Gray. Liana 
Wright, Meghan 5wtt and Illy 
Yule. all of whom ,et new per'oonal 

I\:cord~ In the event. 
Vult! improved her time hy the 

most, cutt ing it hy over nine sec-
onds. 

"Amy really had a big day," 
Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale sa id. 
"She docsn't usually get as much 
attention as the other runners, but 
she has worked as hard as all the 
other runners. She ha rcally come 

along." 
The women 's runners we re not 

the only ones who enjoyed success . 
Men 's co-captain Dave Spector 
also had a hu ge day. Spector set a 

personal record in the pole 
vault with a mark of 
16 ' 1.75 , qualil Ylng him 
for Na lionals. 

Abo sett ing a per~onal 
record was Mike Wallace, 
who ran the 1. 500 in a 

ational -qualifying time 
of 3: 54.31. 

The men" 4x4()O relay 
team of Ju"n Magdaroag. Kirk 
Miller. Matt Amero and Tim Pru-
dence ran a team -best time of 
4:02.72, ea rning them a ational-
qualifying benh . 

"The relay team wa~ really 
imp ressive," Van Arsdnle said . 
,vrhey ran a good race ; their time 
was the besl at UCS D in two 
years." 

Perhap, the Triton that enjoyed 
the mo,t ~ucc<.:,s Satu rday was 
fw, hman thrower Malt Deford. 
Deford had a personal hest throw 
of 126'H" in th e di ,cus and a per-
,onal he, t thm", of 37'3.75 in the 
shot put. 

"Over the t:ourse of tlu: season, 
the ones who make a diffe rence arc 
the ones who are fOl:used," Van 
Arsdale said . "Matt is starting to 
feel comfortable with hi s territory 
- he is followi ng in the footsteps 
of INational -qualifier Matt] 
Seefe ld ." 

This weekend. however. was a 
mere prepara ti on for wha t lies 
ahead this coming weekend for the 
Triton tracksters. The team must 
now prepare for the most imponant 
meet of the year - the CCAA 

onference Cha mpi onships. 
"What I was mo~t impressed 

with thi s weekend was how very-
one stood up fo r ne another as 
tea mm"tes," Van Arsda le sa id . " In 
such an individuall y focused spon 

a~ track, it is key for the overa ll 
team's success that everyone corne 
together as a team." 

ertai nly the UCSD track and 
field team will have its hands fu ll at 
the CCAA meet. matching up 
aga inst such powerhouses as CSU 
Lo, Angeles and Ca l Poly Pomona. 
With the continued improvement of 
the Tritons. though, there arc high 
hopes that the team wi ll be a major 
force to reckon wi th Satu rday. 

The team is also helped by the 
return of women\ long jumper Lil-
lian Liu. who came back this week-
end after a bad ankle injury that 
kep t her out o f Jction. Abo, 
wome n's high jumper Heather 
Winherry i~ ~tUl1ing to return to 
form Jrter hcing hampered wi th a 
~ imilar inj ury. 

With th is good news, Van Ars-
dall.: is gaining confidence in hi s 
squad . 

"I expec t the team to make t:On-
tinucd progress ion and impro ve-
ment - we haven't peaked as a 
team yet." Van Arsdale said.

On behalf of the University Events Office, Associated

like to make a pubtc thank-you to Greg Snee, Director 
of Transp0rlation and Parking Services, for eliminating 
the parking fees on weekends. Eliminating these fees 
has had such a positive impact for both students and 
the public attending our many weekend events and 
activities. It is a wonderful experience to receive thank 
you's from our patrons instead of complaints about

Triton Crew Makes History With Big Win LOGIC: The move makes 
sense financially 
Continued from PIC. 23 

DANCING: The men's varsity eight boat wrote its name into history as it became the fU'St crew from 
any San Diego university in thirty years to capture the Nonnan Watson Cup at the Newport Invitational 
By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Remember that high school 
dance when things just went 
wrong? You had on your best gear 
and you were giving your 
favorile girl "the eye." 
But every time at the last 
moment she looked away, 
or one of the big, burly 
football players stepped 
in to take your dance. 

Even your neighbor 
got a dance with her, and 
you were getting upset 
bccause it was geuing late and thi s 
girl was really worth it. 

This Sunday, the men 's crew 
team finally got it s dance, with the 
varsity eight winning the Newport 
Invitational. Although the varsity 
program resumed only two years 
ago. it has been improving by 
leaps and bounds. 

Thi s season, the men were 
close to winning a regalla on a 
number of occasions. They 
showed ability but did not bring

home any trophies in close sec-
ond-place finishes to the Universi-
ty of Virginia and rival USD 
(though this was later overturned). 
The men also had a third-place 

showing at the California 
State Championships two 
weeks ago. 

This weekend. the Tri-
tons were determined to 
go for the gold - or, in 
the case of the Newport 
Invitational. bring home 
the Norman Watson Cup. 
Racing against most 

Southern California collegiate 
squads, as well as a very game 
squad from UC Davis, UCSD 's 
varsity eight won the regaUa in an 
extremely fast 5:59.6. 

"This race proves that we are 
the fastest boat in Southern Cali-
fornia," rower Wayne Liu said. 
"We had beaten all the teams in 
the race before, but we were still 
tested by Davis." 

Indeed, the confident bunch of 
Aggies got off to a fast start, build-

ing a lead as large as eight scats. 
Working with a slight tailwind, the 
Tritons had Davis well within their 
sites, and made their move at the 
I,OOO-meter mark. At 600 meters, 
UCSD pulled into the lead, never 
to look back en route to a five-sec-
ond margin of victory. 

The varsity eight win will be 
forever recorded in the annals of 
UCSD sports history, for it is the 
first time UCSD has ever won a 
major regatta. 

"The important thing is we 
were able to win a major regatta," 
men's Head Coach Mike Filip-
pone said. lO ll's something we 
were never ablc to do in the past, 
so it took this team to the next 
level. Wc're becoming a top-eche-
lon team." 

It was tougher going for the 
younger rowers. The junior varsity 
eight, which finished fourth , faced 
stiff competition. Much of it came 
from Orange Coast College, which 
sent its varsity team as there was-
n't enough room in the varsity race 

for it. The novice eight fini shed 
fifth, while the novice four placed 
fourth . 

"We did clean up our aets a bit 
and rowed competitively," JV 
third seat Mall Wegner said. 
"However, there is much improve-
ment to be made before Pacific 
Coast Regional Championships in 
two weeks." 

For the women, this weekend's 
regalia, which was slated to be 
held Saturday in Marina Del Rey, 
was canceled. Though this is a rare 
occurrence, storms off the coast 
sent swells which inundated the 
shallow waters and made racing 
impossible. 

"It'll require us to rearrange 
training a little bit ," women's Head 
Coach Jack Vallerga said, flirting 
with the idea of an intra-city faee-
off next weekend to keep the 
women sharp. 'The worst part is it 
means a month without racing. As 
long as the team doesn't get men-
tally stale." it will be an inconve-
nience more than anything else." 

can be overcome. 
It 's great to be a big-time 

research institution, but undergrad-
uates are at least of equal impor-
tance. There are 15,140 of us here. 
If we say we want D-II, we deserve 
it. And if it's obvious we should 
have it, which Athletic Director 
Judy Sweet will tell you. give it to 
us. Docs some professor know bet-
ter than the woman who has been 
A.D. for 23 years? That's insulting. 

I'm glad Chancellor Dynes has 
his ear near to the street. He under-
stands that a vibrant student body is 
the foundation for any university; 
UCSD can't successfully be a one-
dimensional bastion of academics. 

That's why we have this "great 
tradition for emphl\.~izing athletics 
for fun and health" in the first 
place. ' 

Are we concerned with our 
ranking according to U.S. News & 
World Report or our status accord-
ing to the ultimate representatives 
of UCSD - the people who gradu-
ate from here?

22 SPORTS 

IT'S ON! 
THE NHL POSTSEASON 

HAS ARRIVED, AND 
WITH I' USUAL THE 

FANS. FANATICAL BUT 
CAN IT FEMALE BE? A 
PERSPECTIVE? YOU'RE 

RIGH'! DAMN 

The UCSD Guardian Monday, May 4, 1998 

-ec H K 5 , H I G H • 5 T I c K 5 & 

am here for two reasons: the firsl one is to 
address the lack of sports coverage in this, the 
Guardian. Apparenlly the editor of this sec-
tion is nol only a lazy, beer-guzzling, smelly, 
bald couch potato, but he has also never had a 

female writer on his staff. So if there are any 
females in the house, take notice that I am break-

ing barriers, forging into the land where we have been 
silenced for too long. and it is time for a voice to be 
heard . ThaI voice hcing mine. of course, because I hap-
pen 10 be somewhat attached 10 the editor at hand. But 
leI's nol get into that... . 

The second is to encourage my fellow female sports 
followers, especially those of you who lovc hockey, to 
pay attention, because I am about to take center ice. 

If any of you haven' t noticed yel, we are the midst of 
the mOSl exciting sports playoffs this year, namely 
HOCKEY. No one can deny Ihat hockey is the rno t 
vi sually impressive and intensive sport with barbaric 
men slashing, checking and brawling 10 the bitter end 
for the chance of holding Lord Stanley 'S Cup. 

It all started on that fateful Wed., April 22. Any and 
all books or signs of midterms were tossed aside and, to 
quote the fervor of the moment , " It was ON." 

The set-up is simple, best of seven, with two rounds, 
then a conference final and then the sacred Stanley Cup 
Finals (June 9-23). Basically. for the next month-and-a-
half my life will be to eat, drink and sleep hockey. 

There on my velvet wallllowcr couch I made my 
haven, needing only my remote and a beer (yes, ) am a 
girl and I love beer), as I curse the re ferees and egg on 
the players from a di stance. I love this sport where tra-
dilion has allowed clean , fair and violent rage to unveil 
from the li sts of true men. 

To give a brief overview of where the playoffs stand 
currentl y, we are wrapping up the lirst round. The 
Kings, Fl yers, Penguins, Sharks, Coyoles. Bruins and 
Devils have all been eliminated from the running a~ of 
Sunday afternoon. Advancing are the Blues, Stars, 
Canadiens, Red Wings, Senators, Sabres and Capitals. 
Though I am prctty ticked with these early result s, the 
wound is even more painful wilh Ihe terrible calls that 
took place. specilically in lhe Western Conference's San 
Jose Sharks vs. Dallas Slars series. 

There is a fairly recent rule in hockey where a goal 
will not count if an opposing playcr has any part of his 
body in the crease when the puck crosses the goal line. 
The crease (for the hockey illiterate) is a small half-cir-
cle right in front of the goal. 

Unfortunalely. in lhat series lhe linesmen and referee 
forgot about this little rule and allowed two Stars' goals 
to count, one with an entire Stars' player in the crease , 
and one wilh the skate. Nevertheless, the poinl is Ihat 
the referee did not look at the replay and the Sharks 
ended up losing game five, 3-2. 

I have a theory thaI if the referees had made the cor-

rec t call , lhe Shark s would have won and led the series , 
3-2. BUI no, the referees had to sc rew up and now lhe 
Sharks arc out of lhe playoffs. I Ihi nk lhe referces may 
be paying a lillie too much alienI ion 10 lhe league ra nk-
ings with the Stars al /llllI/ e ro 11110 and the Shark s at 
TlIlIIlI' ro ocho, causing the Stars to face a big upset if the 
Sharks were 10 win the se ri es (even though recent Slar 
history has no thing hut disappoint ments in the IIrst 
rounds of the playo ffs). 

Another slr<tnge occurre nce in thc Sharh and Slars 
battle was lhc , uddenly- rn issing Tony Granato. replaced 
wilh the Sharks' coach's brother, who I must ac knowl-
edge did score a goal in the playoffs. l3ut where was lhe 
Most Improved Player of the 1996-97 season, not to 
mention the commi ssioner-picked All -Star player? 

As the rirst round comes to a close, my prediclions 
for the Cup are now clear. I wo uld like nothing more 
than to see Scolly Bowman 's Detroi t Red Wings lose. ) 
know this is possible because of one man, the Sabre,' 
savior, Dominik Hasek. More Ihan a goa ltender, he is a 
bric k wall who was able 10 keep even Eri c Lindros and 
hi s NO.2-ranked Philade lphia Flyers fro m coming 
inside. 

Just a reminder: a girl wrote thi s out of her undying 
love for hockey and her desi re to make nol only a 
female voice heard but to spread the virus of playo ff 
hockey. Don' t be afraid girl s. Sports aren' t just for boys, 
and it 's OK to skip go ing to the gym if the puck is on.

. If you have ever seen a listing of the var-

ious teams UCSD competes wilh in Divi-
sion III, you would be ashamed. Chapman, 
Cal Lutheran and Pomona-Pitzer are some 
of our most hated rivals. We play against 
tiny schools, virtually none of whom are 
public institutions. UCSD can'l even find 
opponents to play against half the time 
because they're scared of getting whooped 
by some upstart in Division m. 

We're like a wolf in sheep's clothing, and 
it's time we grew up to be a wolf. This is 
nothing against UCSD's athletes, who 
steadily win and represent UCSD with 
pride, but their coaches would probably tell 
you the same. 

People are always upset when UCSD 
spends money on things that don't directly 
benefit them. We have people like Newt 

CHAMPS: 
The Tritons finished the 
season with a bang 
Continued from Pale 24 

Through four innings, the Tritons were 
cruising with a 6-0 lead. Triton staner John 
Gherini was pitching as solid as the Tritons 
were hitting. 

However, the Panthers were not about to 
fold. They gradually chipped away at the 
Triton lead, capitalizing on a couple UCSD 
blunders, which led to a 7-6 Panther lead. 
But the Tritons weren't worried. 

Instead, the boys sucked it up and staged 
an impressive comeback, answering the 7

Gingrich and Jesse Jackson speak here and 
people are upset because they don't repre-
sent their personal agendas. But diversity 
requires a lot of give and a little take, and 
hopefully. when you look back, you realize 
how that giving benefited you. 

I'm happy when we have guest lecturers 
speak about physics or chemistry - not 
because it 's my subject but because these 
are important topics and it contributes to the 
pool of brains on this campus and may filter 
down to me. I don't complain that we spend 
money on Student Safety Awareness and the 
Office for Students with Disabilities; I don't 
use those services but I know other people 
benefit from them. 

So funds may have to be reallocated to 
bump us up to Division II. UCSD's enroll-
ment is expected to increase by 1,500 over 
the next three years, which would add well 
over $1 million in registration fees, close to 
the same amount as the move to Division II 
would cos!. 

I do find it sadly ironic that to improve 
student life and intercollegiate athletics we 
will have to divert funds from other student 
services, but it's an amount of money that

"Winning our own tournament was a 
good way to end the season," Gulati said. 
"Everyone fought so hard . I was happy that 
we could get a win for the seniors . It also 
felt good to win the season series [with

With its three wins this weekend, the Tri-

Though the Tritons will lose key seniors 
Mark Mason, George Escanuelas, Eric Pan-

others to fill in next year. Perhaps a playoff 
bid is only one season away.

Head Coach Brian Turner described his teams are all that is left to battle it out for the 
team's doubles play as "terrible," and 
seemed concerned that similar play might 
hurt UCSD in the Regional playoffs. 

The Tritons, however, put together a 
much better effort in singles as they won 
five out of the six match-ups. 

Shabel had a difficult time at No. I, but

A Voice of Reason 
on Division II 

Who is thi s rai sing a rut:kus 
against moving up to Di vision 
H? The topic has been addresscd 
timc and again , but I feci oblig-
ated to raise an opinionated 
voicc on behalf of thc sports 
staff now that the hour of crucial 
voting, pending a mail ballot 
pctition has arrived. 

"We have a grcat tradition 
for emphasizing athletics for 
fun and hcalth," Mathematics 
Professor David Fitzgerald said 
in Thursday's Guardian. "If you 
want that kind of cheering 
atmosphere, you can pick out 
professional teams or other 
school's teams," 

Biology Professor Douglas 
Smith said, "Division III has 
served UCSD wcll in the past 
and in thc present." 

These guys illustrate beauti -
fully how much of the academic 
faculty and students interact at 
UCSD, and why students are 
somctimes dissatisfied. Divi -
sion III doesn '. serve UCSD 
well , and really, I wouldn't 
mind having a "cheering atmos-
pherc" where more than a cou-
ple students on this divcrse 
campus share something in 
common. 

Has anyonc noticed that 
UCSD undergrads don ' t share a 
sensc of community? 

It 's unfortunatc that students 
can't live ncar the campus and 
that this is a young university 
with few traditions, but can we 
changc that? I believe that 
sports can possibly help. Even if 
the move to Division U is minor, 
at least it's a step in the right 
direction. 

Undergraduate students 
come here fresh from home-
town life with family and high 
school, where you have some-
thing in common with everyone, 
only to learn, often startlingly, 
how different we all arc. Would-
n't it be nice to have something 
in common, something to sup-
port whether you arc a Christian 
or a Filipino or an artist or a 
Greek, something you could 
share with any fellow Triton 
besides grumbling about the lat-
est fecs or midterms? 

Evidently a few kids think 
so, as evidenced by the respons-
es to the Campus Quality of Life 
Survey. Meanwhile, these acad-
emics could care less. 

Being a "primarily high-
standard academic in titution," 
as Smith has affirmed, does not 
necessarily produce satisfied, let 
alone well-rounded graduates. 
This should be of concern to 
profe sors who are a part of 
UCSD' community no mailer 
how out of touch they are. 

As it i now, UCSO has a 
token athletic program. I mean

UCSD is the Champion 
arnERSWEET: Although the Tritons won their own tournament 
this weekend, they couldn't manage to make it to the postseason 
By John Maynard 
Staff Writer 

To win 20 games and not make it to the play-
offs is a shame. This is the unfortunate fate of 
the Tritons. 

But that didn ' t keep the Tritons 
down, as they put together an outstand-
ing two days this weekend, hosting the 
annual uc San Diego Triton Classic. 

Despite suffering earlier losses to 
both the University of La Verne and 
Chapman University, the UC hard-_ 
bailers came out strong on Saturday 
and Sunday to conquer not only these 
two schools, but also Menlo College en 
route to winning their own tournament. 

To say "win" is, perhaps, an understatement. 
On Saturday, UCSO flat-out embarrassed its two 
opponents. 

In its earlier of two games, UCSO routed 
Menlo College, 15-2. It came out with even 
harder bats in the aftemoon with a 20-6 shel-
lacking of La Verne. 

Against Menlo, the Tritons fired largely in 
the first pair of innings, charging to a 7- 1 lead 
after twos. The definite highlight of these two 
innings was third baseman Ryan Hill, who bat-
led in 5 of the first 7runs. Hill went the yard 
twice in his first two at-bats. driving in 2 runs in 

the first and 3 in the second. 
While the Tritons were having thcir way at 

the plate, they also had it going defensively. Tri-
ton starter John Wi lIis stumped the Oaks 
through seven innings, giving up only 2 runs 

while striking out three. 
Just like in the morning, the Tritons 

started off early, scoring II times in the 
first three innings. But thi s time the 
love was spread out a bit more. Five 
Tritons had I or more RBis in these 
first threc innings, with de ignated hit-
ter Steve Pelletier racking up 3 to help 
the win. 

With the victory, the Triton 
advanced to the winner 's bracket where they 
met Division III nemesis Chapman for a pair of 
games on Sunday. The Tritons have had lheir 
troubles with Chapman this season, but the com-
petition has always been well met. 

"We really like the battle we get when we 
play Chapman," catcher Rampi Gulati said. 
"Sometimes it seems like we are too trong for 
schools like Menlo, but with Chapman there 's 
always a good fight. " 

Though the Tritons were defeated. I 0-6 in 
the morning, the boys remained confident as 
they put together a fearless afternoon win.

Young UCSD 
Continues 
to Learn 
1999: The Tritons firrished 
their season with a pair of 
tough losses to rival Chapman 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 
. With no regrets and bright eyes to the 

future, the UCSD softball team concluded it s 
1998 campaign. Last Saturday, on their own 

grass, thc Tritons played 
their final two games of the 
season against hapman, 
the No.2-ranked team in all 
of Division Ill . 

Although the Tritons fell 
by scores of 7-2 and 9-0, 
they were by no means 
pushovers. If it wasn't for 
two big innings, the out-

come could have been much different. 
As it was, the Panthers had a 4-run sixth 

in game one and a 7-run second in game two, 
and that was enough to post two more victo-
ri es . 

"We had a great week of practi ce," Head 
Coach Patti Gerckens said . "The first gamc 
showed that we were ready, but Chapman 
was just stronger. Nobody liked how it 
ended, but sometimes things don't fall how 
you'd like them to." 

Going into Saturday's doubleheader, the 
Tritons still had a slim chance at thc postsea-
son. They had to rout the Panthers in both 
games in ordcr to have a shot, so needless to 
say, they also hit the field fired up. 

Gerckens ent Erin Flanigan to the mound 
for the first game, and it was a great decision. 
Flanigan was solid throughout the game. She 
kept the Panthers at bay for three innings. 

Then in the fourth , Slephanie Carew, the 
much-ballyhooed daughter of Hall-of-Famer 
Rod Carew stepped into the box. Carew got a 
pitch that hung for just a little too long and 
drilled it out of the yard. The Panthers then 
tacked on another run to take a 2-0 lead. 

But some slick base-running by second 
baseman Alejandra Sotelo and third baseman 
Jeanine Cordero, with some errors by the 
Panthers, allowed the Tritons to knot the 
score at 2 going into the fifth. 

Things stayed calm in the fifth, then the 
noodgates opened in the top of the sixth. The 
Panthers, known for their hitting prowess at 
the top of the lineup, got some production out 
of the bottom of it as lhey strung together 
some hits and ended up with 4 runs. 

Try as they might, the Tritons could not 
put together a rally of their own and fell , 7-2. 

In the second game, the valiant Tritons 
battled, but again UCSO's bats were stymied 
as the Panther pitching proved too powerful 
in a 9-0 loss. 

As the Tritons conclude thi s season, they 
are disappointed in the results, but are hope-
ful for the future . Aside from Flanigan, this 
entire squad of gritty women will return for a 
run at the 1999 postseason.
