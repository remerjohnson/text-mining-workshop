Year of the Snake Hits UCSD 
Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations held in the Price 
Center and the Graduate School of International Relations 
., MAllYAM BAlllllAlllEMI 
Contributing News Writer 

Asian food, sports and arts had a field day 
at "The Year of the Snake" festival, held Friday 
afternoon at the Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific Studies 
courtyard. 

The annual event, presented by IRlPS, 
was a huge success in spite of some bad 
weather. 

"We've had a good turnout, despite the 
rain: said Christine Ha, co-president of 
South East Asian Link. 

The four-hour event celebrated Japanese, 
Korean, Vietnamese and Chinese cultures. 
Nearly 150 people were in attendance, includ-
ing those of Asian and non-Asian back-
grounds alike. 

"The campus here is very diverse: Ha 
said. "Lots of different backgrounds are here 
and it's a lot of fun, especially since Southeast 
Asia is often unrecognized." 

The linguistics department hosted the fes-

tival and helped to put it together with the 
[RIPS students. 

"We did the framework, and the students 
planned it: said Japanese language professor 
Kuniko Tada. "It's a great opportunity for stu-
dents to show what they've learned. We don't 
see this great hidden cultural learning in lan-
guage classes." 

Language classes do not usually discuss 
the social and political aspects of the coun-
tries they are covering, so the festival makes 
for a good experience of the cultural side of 
the languages students are learning. 

The program started with an elaborate 
Lion' Dance and a Bamboo Stick Dance. 
Students presented kung fu and karate per-
formances, along with presentations of origa-
mi (paper fo lding), shoduo Uapanese calligra-
phy) and ikebana Uapanese flower arrange-
ment) .

Vanilla Ice 
Performs at 
Club Ritmo 
Ice surprised those in 
attendance with his message 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

Rain was not enough to stop people from 
coming to see Vanilla Ice Friday night at Club 
Ritmo's second show. The club debuted earlier 
this month with Tone Loc headlining. 

Abollt 400 people packed the Stage at the 
Pub despite the wet weather outside. 

Before the show began , A.S. Assistant 
Programmer Eisha Christian was optimistic 
about the night's headliner. 

"I've heard really really good reports [about 
Vanilla Ice] because we do references on what-
ever act we bring to this campus: Christian 
said. "Everyone's pumped up and they love 
(Ice] and they definitely recommended him ... 
so I'm expecting it to be awesome." 

A.S. Assistant Programmer Anahita Ferasat 
explained why Vanilla Ice was chosen to per-
form. 

"He has a good name and everyone knows 
him: Ferasat said. "We wanted a little publici-
ty for our club because we didn't have a name 
yet." 

DJ Crazy and DJ Kurt Mueller of the DJs 
and Vinylphiles Club opened the show around 
9 p.m. According to DVC president Andy 
Livingston , the group is very appreciative 
toward the club for asking them to play on 
such a regular basis. 

"I kind of like these events ... because we get 
that other half of people who wouldn't nor-
mally hear this kind of music," Livingston said. 
"You know, if they hate it then they hate it ... 
but if they like it, then that's just more 
increased exposure." 

Ferasat praised DVC for its support of the 
club. 

"We absolutely love working with them: 
Ferasat said. "We're going to continuously 
work with them because they're helping us, 
we're helping them, it's a very good relation-
ship with them." 

Marshall sophomore Joanna Chang was 
curious to see the club for the first time. 

"I heard they turned the Pub into a club and 
so it sounded like a fun th ing to do," Chang 
said.

A.S. Council and Athletic Department Unveil New Mascot 
Revamped Triton debuted at UCSD men's basketball game last week 

Associllt. News Editor 

After years of student antici-
pation for the arrival of an identi-
fiable spirit leader, the A.S. 
Council and the Athletic 
Department finally revealed the 
new Thton Mascot Saturday, Jan. 
20 at halftime of the UCSD 
men's basketball game against 
California State University 
Dominguez Hills. 

Assistant Athletic Director Ken 
GI'OIIC said that the new costume 
stands about 6'S" with an over-
sized head, I toga-like outfit, ftow-

ing hair, a beard and long muscu-
lar legs. 

"Peop'~ will really be 
impressed," said A.S. President 
Doc Khaleghi. "I am proud to be at 
a school that has this mascot." 

The Thton has always been the 
school's nickname, although no 
mascot existed until recently. 

The first costume ideas were 
desiJned by previous A.S. 
PreSIdent Tesh Khullar, along with 
A.S. Marketing Director 'tracie 
Davie, Thton Tide leader Matt 
Deford and Grosse. 

The final two designs were 
finalized last summer after Khullar 

graduated and Khaleghi took over 
as A.S. President and member of 
the committee. 

The two remaining ideas were 
sent to the Utah-based company 
A1incoe Costume who made the 
final product after reviewing the 
committcc's two designs. The cos-
tume cost approximately $5,000 to 
make. 
. The faculty expressed excite-

ment over the new addition to the 
school, as it represents a rare joint 
project between the Associated 
Students and the athletic depart-
ment. 

"Overall, I think it's going to be 

a great addition to the campus and 
should benefit a lot of people: 
Grosse said. "The process of mak-
ing it a reality will hopefully be the 
first in a long line of collaborative 
efforts between athletics and the 
A.S., as well as other UCSD orga-
nizations." 

Currently the A.S. Council and 
the athletic department plan on 
the mascot perfonning at halftime 

sho~ at basketball games and 
during intermissions in volleyball. 
In his first appearance, the mascot 
drew a large crowd and kept the

Collegiate: 
No similar study has been

ContInued from ..... 1 
lege freshmen reporting regular use of 
computers in the previous year of high 
school. However, the gap in confi-
dence levels between men and women 
was the widest since computer-related 
questions were first included in the 
study in 1985. 

No similar study has been con-
ducted at Boston University as of yet. 
However, Mark Crovella, associa te 
professor in the computer science 
department at BU, claimed "this is def-
initely not the case with my students." 

Although Crovella admits his 
observations might be slanted because 
his students are self-selected for their 
interests in computers to begin with, 
he said he sees no difference in profi-
ciency or confidence levels between 
the twO sexes. 

According to researchers at 
UCLA, a popular explanation for the 
study's findings involves chi ldhood 
t<1ys. 

While a large majority of boys 
have grown up playing computer and 
video games, researchers said girls 
have traditionally played with Barbies 
and dolls. 

This theory is based on the fi nd-
ings that women are less likely to fre-
quently partake in Internet chat 
room discussions and spend much 
less time playing video games than 
do males. 

A number of organizations have 
been founded recently in attempts to 
encourage women to become better 
educated in computers and to prevent 
them from being disadvantaged in the 
future, something study organizers 
fear. 

The Association for Women in 
Computing, founded in 1978, is a 
nonprofit organization promoting the 
advancement of women in computing 
professions. 

Their work is in add ition to the 
work of companies li ke Mattei, 
which is also tryi ng to attract women 
to computers. They have begun to 
target young gi rls by creating com-
puter software that appeals to them, 
including a nu mber of games featur-
ing Barbie.

Mascot: 
Auditions will be held for 
someone to play the Triton 
ContInued from ..... 1 
fans energetic throughout the 
game. 

Khaleghi said the mascot's first 
appearance was a success. 

"I think the students loved 
him; Khaleghi said. "It was one of 
the most impressive turnouts I 
have seen fo r a home game." 

Khaleghi said that he thi nks 
the response will be even better 
once a full -time trained mascot is 
found. Student tryouts wi ll be 
held sometime in the near future 
and the wi nner will attend mascot 
ca mp. 

[n addition, Grosse said that 
once the mascot becomes more 
mai nstream on campus, it will 
begin to participate in other school 
activities. 

"Wf:7 anticipate and wan t to 
have the mascot do a variety of 
appearances on and off campus; 
he said. "The nonathletic and off-
ca mpus appearances wi ll probably 
be limited at firs t as we get the 
mascot comfortable in its role, 
learn what works and what does-
n't and see what opportunities are 
ava ilable." 

Athletic Director Earl Edwards 
said these appearances arc impor-
tant because they will boost school 
spirit and give the school some-
thing it has never had. 

"Most schools have a mascot 
and we didn't have one," he said. 
"We need to start making an iden-
tity that is reflected upon our 
school." 

It is hoped that the mascot wi ll 
provide the new energy and fan 
support that Khaleghi believes is 
needed to compete in Division [I. 

"Eighty-six percent of students 
wa nted to make the jump to 
Division II; he said. "Now we need 
to support our teams in every way 
possible and the mascot is one of 
those ways. We need to have the 
spirit and support that other 
Division II schools get."

" illing to the. Brim 
The growth of the campus should viewed positively as it will. 
bring better academics and sports to the school 
By VALERlIIIURNI 
Staff Writer 

UCSD always looks empty to me. [ don't 
know why. It's fa irly easy to appear empty 
when you have the second largest UC cam-
pus with one of the smaller student popula-
tions. Although it's easy to be afraid of 
change, especially such a big change as 
school expansion, [ 
view this change posi-
tively. ot only would 
more studen ts bring 
increased diversity, but 
the university would 
have to make a number 
of ad ministrative 
changes in order to 
deal with the influx of 
students. Some of these 
changes would include bigger academic 
departments, more professors, differerrt · 
classes offered and current classes offered 
more times a year. 

Let's be realistic: This campus could 
serve a lot more than 20,000 students. The 
only time the campus appears fully populat-
ed is during the day on Library Walk. Geisel 

Library fills up once a quarter, during finals 
week. On the weekends, campus is a ghost 
town. A lot of UCSD resources not only 
remain unused but also unnoticed. I'm a 
se'cond-year student here and still unaware 
of hundreds of things going on the campus 
where [live. 

A lot of people complain about student 
apathy here at UCSD. [ think the lack of 

school spirit could be 
explained by the separation 
into five different colleges 
and the absence of campus 
unity. With more students 
added and subsequently 
more colleges, school spirit 
will increase. [ found out 
firsthand that the lack of 
school spirit is more of a 
school tradition, in which 

older students inform younger students of 
the trend of apathy, and younger students 
play the nonchalant role to fit in. With more 
freshmen coming in every year, school spir-
it and campus unity are bound to increase. 
Less and less freshmen will be aware that

Christian CD Offers Great Laughs 
Stop 
Thaft 

BERTRAND FAN 

M y best friend called me up because he had received a CD burner 
and a DSL line for Christmas, 
which is a bad combination to 
begin with, and he wanted to 
know if [ had any albums to rec-
ommend for his newborn music-
stealing frenzy. ( immediately 
answered, "Kids' Rodin' Rap-
pin' Gospell" 

[ received the CD for my 
birthday and did not think much 
of it at the time. I'm not really 
one for joke presents, especially 
when there isn't a real present 
after the Joke present, which was 
exactly the scenario in this case. 
My friend had just started work-
ing at a record store, so [ expect 
he snagged it before anybody 
else could get to it. Either that or 
it was sitting in a box collecting 
dust and he invoked his 30 per-
cent employee discount to get it 
down to 70 cents. 

The cover is pretty enticing. 
At the top, it says "Kids' Rodin' 
Rappin' Gospell " with a dove. To 
the right it says, "Twenty Bible 
Songs!" because everyone wants 
a lot of Bible songs (a dozen real-
ly wouldn't be enough) . My 
favorite is at the bottom: "Today's 
Sound for Today's Kids!" [f 
"Rockin ' Rappin ' Gospel" is 
"Today's Sound for Today's 
Kids", I'm no longer embarrassed 
by anything [ listened to when [ 
was 10. I always thought 

"Today's Sound for Today's 
Kids" was just edited pop songs, 
like Christi!"a Aguilera's "Genie 
in a Bottle" without the sexual 
innuendos. 

[ remember [ was at Disney-
land and they were playing that 
Chumbawamba song, except 
they had changed all the lyrics so 
that it wasn't a drinking song any 
more - it was really just about 
pizza and soft drinks. It was pret-
ty disturbing, but now [ realize [ 

I always thought Cibo 
Matto was funny, 
because hey -
Japanese rap - but 
Christian rap? More 
specifically, Christian 
kids' rap? My friend 
and I put the CD in his 
CD player and laughed 
uncontrollably for 
about 10 minutes, 
didn't know what disturbing 
really was until [ saw the cover of 
"Kids' Rockin' Rapping Gospel." 
[n the middle, it has a drawing of 
a white girl, a black guy with his 
cap turned around with a pink 
boom box and the obligatory 
Asian kid, all rappin'. Or rather, 
rockin ' and rappin'. 

[ always thought Cibo Matto 
was funny, because hey - Japan-
ese rap - but Christian rap? 
More specifically, Chtistian kids' 
rap? My friend and [ put the CD 
in his CD player and laughed 

uncontrollably for about 10 min-
utes. Ever since that day, I've kept 
it in my car and whenever some-
one new gets in, [ say, "Want to 
listen to some Rockin' Rappin' 
Gospel?" and play my favorite 
tracks. The second track, "0, 
How [ Love Jesus", is a pretty 
solid song and a good introduc-
tion to the CD. Most people react 
by saying, "Umm. Hee hee. 
That's pretty funny. We're not 
really going to listen to this are 
we?" This is the point at which 
I switch to track five, "God [s So 
Good", turn the bass up, the 
windows down and the child 
safety lock on. 

"God [s So Good" is an 
innovative song because it only 
has four lines: "God is so good 
/ He's so good to me / He 
answers prayers, he answers 
prayers / He cares for me, He 
cares for me / [ love him so, [ 
love him so." As the chorus 
chants "God is so good, he's so 
good to me: the kids take 
turns "rappin'" the other three 
lines. 

This gets old pretty damn 
fast, which leads me to the 12th 
track, "jesus Loves the Little 

Children". My favorite part of the 
song is "Red and yellow, black and 
white. They are precious in His 
sight. jesus loves the little children 
of the world." It's mostly my 
favorite part of the song because 
that's the only part in the song. 
What [ think the Wonder Kids are 
trying to say here is that Jesus 
loves the little children of the 
world, even the Native American 
Asian mulatto ones, but not the

Editor: 
Have you noticed the flyers 

describing our student funding 
going toward the support of 
hatred and anti-Semetism? Or 
perhaps you have seen the Union 
of Jewish Students and the "Toler-
ance" table condemning the Mus-
lim Student Association and the 
Muslim Culture Club for its 
upcoming event, anti-Zionism 
week. As a member of these orga-
nizations, and as a Muslim, [ must 
express my disappointment at 
being misrepresented. ( am hurt 

that we can be labeled advocates 
of hatred before our event has 
even taken place, before our voic-
es have been heard. So now [ 
speak, and [ hope our message 
brings more understanding to 
what our cause truly is. 

Zionism is a political ideology 
founded in 1890 by an atheist, 
Theodore Herzl. According to the 
"American Heritage Dictionary: 
Zionism is "an organized move-
ment of world jewry that arose in 
Europe in the late 19th century 
with the aim of reconstituting a 
Jewish state in Palestine. Modern 
Zionism is concerned with the 
development and support of the 
state of Israel." 

This political movement led to 
the displacement of the Palestini-
ans from their land of 1,300 years 
and th us has prevented them 
from being in their Holy Land. 
Today, over 60 percent of the 
Palestinian people are refugees. 
Their homes were and are being 
bulldozed as new homes are being 
established in their place for jew-
ish settlers. 

Israel's military occupation is 
illegitimate and oppressive. For 52 
years, the Palestinians have faced 
tanks, machine guns, aerial bomb-
ings of mosques, bazaars and vil-
lages, house demolition, confisca-
tion of businesses, raiding of 
schools, physical abuse, rape, kid-
nappings, torture ... the list goes 
on. Unarmed men, women and 
children are killed every day by 
Israeli soldiers. 

Our program is meant to bring 
awareness to the Zionist state 9f

they are supposed to loathe 
UCSD and all its spirit nights. 

There is a lot of complaining 
on campus regarding the ability to 
get certain classes and the small 
rotation of professors in some 
departments. With student popu-
lation growth, the university will 
be fo rced to hire more faculty and 
increase the size of departments as 
well as the amount of classes 
being offe red. The university 
should be able to afford to offer 
more obscure classes for every 
department. The faculty hired 
here will ~ lso stay at the current 
level of academic superiority. 
There is no need to fear the 
decline of academic standards. [n 
expanding UCSD, the administra-
tion will have the examples of 
UCLA and UC Berkeley to look to 
in keeping academic standards 

Con:

c .................... . 

school is building the structures, 
the parking situation is only 
going to get worse, and expan-
sion is only going to add to the 
existing problem. One might 
argue that the construction of 
new parking structures would 
eventually solve all parking prob-
lems. The problem is trya t plans 
for future struc tures are not 
finalized and it is not likely that 
UCSD would have all the funds 
to build all those structures 
because the parking structures 
have to be self-funding. Unless 
the school actually builds these 
structures, limiting its expansion 
is still the best solution. Having 

high while having bigger student 
populations. Both Berkeley and 
UCLA have more students than 
UCSD (each by about 10,000) and 
are both comparably higher in the 
"U.S. News and World Report" 
annual college ranking. 

For those of you who are 
sports fa ns, the student popula-
tion boom will make it inevitable 
for UCSD to have a Division [ 
athletic department, which will 
ultimately lead to a football team. 
A school cannot be a Division [ 
school without a football team. So 
how, might you ask, will this hap-
pen? The administration will be 
unable to ignore the clamoring of 
even Qlore student sports fans for 
a football team. Additionally, UC 
schools have a history of moving 
to Division [ with the passage of 
time, as well as with student pop-
ulation booms. UC Riverside and 
UCSB are examples of campuses 
that have recently moved up to 
Division I. [t is inevitable that UC 
Davis will move up to Division [ 
with its success in Division II 
sports, along with its increasing 

more people on campus would 
only worsen the whole parking 
problem. 

UCSD plans to deal with the 
ever-increasing parking problem 
by restricting student parking. 
Several ideas have been proposed. 
One is to limit parking permit 
sales to students who live off cam-
pus. Another is to ban permit sales 
to all entering freshmen . A third is 
to sell permits only to those who 
live a certain distance from 
school. 

All these options are disadvan-
tageous to the students. Imagine 
trying to get a ride to go to the 
supermarket, mall , movies or 
clubs. Even if one were to use 
public transportation to get to 
those destinations, it would still 
be inconvenient, as buses often 
arrive late. Not ha~ing a car is also 
not practica l. Dining halls and 
campus restaurants charge stu-

student base. [t is easy to imagine 
UCSD hitting the 30,000 student 
mark, and it is nearly impossible 
to imagine a school with that 
many people without a Division [ 
athletic pr0$l'am. This will surely 
bring athletic scholarships to our 
nerdy UCSD, and subsequent 
success and notoriety in sports. 

This is all beside tlle point. 
How stupid would the regents be 
if they passed up the chance to 
expand UCSD? Here we are, 
already the third best academical-
ly ranked UC campus, in a mere 
40 years of existence, located in 
one of the premier vacation spots 
in the states, and feeding off a 
booming Californian population 
of young scholars eager for a rea-
sonably priced, great education. 
And to boot, we have tons of acres 
of land within UCSD lying 
unscathed, and calling out for 
thousands of students to keep it 
company. UCSD is essentially the 

• ultimate capitalist opportunity for 
the regents. Using public money

campus stores offer students an 
alternative to the expensive food 
on campus. Students need a way 
to get to these stores. Walking to 
the~ stores is not an entirely 
practical idea. Unless food ser-
vices on campus start to lower 
their prices, the only way the stu-
dents can save money is to shop 
off campus. Restricting trans-
portation would only create a 
monopoly for on-campus dining 
facilities and make matters worse. 
[f UCSD were not to expand, 
then there would not be a need to

Residential life on campus 

would be affected by the admis-
sion of more students. One of the

Zionism is a political agenda 
created about 110 years ago. 
Judaism is a religion going back 
thousands of years. And a Semite is 
a racial. and geographical identity. 
Arabs are also considered Semites. 
Thus anti-Zionism is not "anti-W

Anti-Zionism is "anti-W the 
political ideology and practices of 
the state of Israel. It is anti-oppres-

One thing I discovered with 
the CD is that after the 20th track, 
the songs start over in split-track, 
with the vocals on the left stereo

Con: 
Class sizes will be a large 
problem in the fu.ture 
cont .... ed from ,., •• 
spacious than either one of those 
schools and has better living 
arrangements. Should UCSD emu-
late UCLA and UC Berkeley's 
practices? I say no. 

The other issue concerns the 
quality of the residences on cam-
pus. Everyone knows that without 
remodeling, the residence halls and 
the apartments become quite shab-
by after a few years. Even when the 
school is not building any new res-
idence halls or apartments, it is 
having trouble financing the neces-
sary remodeling of all the housing 
on campus. Along with more stu-
dents come either more buildings 
or overcrowding in existing ones. 
Either way, maintenance and 
remodeling costs would skyrocket 
and the overall living quality for 
on-campus residents would deteri-
orate. Buildings would be remod-
eled less frequently and less thor-
oughly. The residents would suffer 
the ultimate loss. 

The final consideration con-
cerns the class size here. Lower-
division classes are held in lecture 
halls that hold a few hundred stu-

Pro: 
More growth would bring 
UCSD to praminence 
continued from page 8 
to expand a public good, and 
extract greater profit from it. If the 
UCSD population reaches a cer-
tain point, maybe it will be possible 
for the regents to bring down 
tuition because of the larger profit 
they are bringing in. 

We live in a democracy that 
survives on capitalism. We go to a 
public university. We at UCSD 
cannot say wc didn't see this com-
ing. It is only the American way to 
exhaust our resources to provide 

dents all at one time. Having more 
students translates to bigger class 
sizes, meaning less personal inter-
action between the professor and 
the students. Studies have already 
shown that smaller class sizes facil -
itate learning, a reason why I:le-
mentary schools, junior highs and 
high schools througnout California 
are trying to reduce their class 
sizes. But at UCSD, the class size 
continues to increase steadily. The 
increasing class size reduces the 
effectiveness of teaching. Having 
more students also means more 
competition and less research 
chances for students. 

Everyone knows how hard it is 
to get the classes they wanted to 
take when they first arrived at 
UCSD. The situation would get 
worse if more students were 
admitted in future entering classes. , 
The inabi~ity to get into lower-divi-
sion classes would increase the 
chance that students have to take 
longer to graduate. This could 
mean a disaster for students. 

All these are reasons why , 
UCSD should not have any more 
students, unless these issues can be 
resolved. Not having adequate 
preparations that are sufficient to 
meet the demands of an increasing 
future student populati0n would 
only exacerbate the current prob-
lems and create new ones. 

the most enjoyment and wealth for 
all hard-working citizens. By 
allowing more students into the 
university, the regents will increase 
their profits and satisfy the needs 
of a growing California middle 
class. 

UCSD itself will achieve all of 
the things outlined in this article. 
These include more school spirit, · 
Division I sports, bigger depart-
ments with a higher rotation of 
professors and classes offered, as 
well as the benefits that come with 
a more well known school name. 
Maybe UCSD will stop being the 
secret of San Diego. Maybe I will be 
able to reply "UCSD" instead of 
"UC San Diego" when people ask 
me where I go to school.

show tonight, so it was pretty fun," 
Ice said. 

Toward the end of the show, Ice 
invited students on stage to free-
style rap. Although only one person 
participated, the rest remained on 
stage to dance for the duration of 
the concert. 

"It was awesome, I had a great 
time," Ice said after his perfor-
mance. "I've been given like a sec-
ond chance so I'm very grateful." 

He went on to promote his new 
album, which will feature guests 
from Insane Clown Posse, Soul Fly, 

Wu Tang Clan, Public Enemy and 
many other musical groups. 

Ice said he wanted to clarify that 
his goal is not to make a comeback. 

"I let people know that I'm not 
trying to do what I did before, it's not 
like I'm a product of the industry or 
a puppet on a string, you know, 1 
kind of cut those strings and I'm off 
doing my own thing now," Ice said. 
"It's not so radio-friendly, it's not so 
commercial or mainstream, you 
know, it's just real." 

lee said he would like the public 
to focus more on his music. 

"I learned that music is about 
expression ... a lot of people pretty 
much want to know about my life 
and what I've been through ," Ice 
said. "It's been a heavy roller coast-
er, from suicide to loneliness 
through all kinds of drugs and 
crazy things. The VH-l special 
kind of showed a glimpse of that 
but the music is a much more per-
sonal part of myself ... so I'm using 
music sort of as my release to exor-
cise my demons." 

After the performance, 
Christian remarked how Ice was a 
little more extreme than the A.S. 
Council had anticipated'. She was 
referring to an incident late in the 
show in which the artist repeatedly 
encouraged female concert-goers 
to flash the rest of the audience. 

"I don't want [the club] to be 
trashy," Christian said. "But then, 
we also know that each performer 
brings his own flavor, and we 
learned from this experience." 

Ferasat shared a similar senti-
ment. 

"We were a little offended by 
what he did on stage, we just weren't 
expecting anything that kind of 
explicit," she said. "His performance 
was a little more than expected." 

As for the Club Ritmo's future, 
both Christian and Ferasat are very 
optimistic. The next show is sched-
uled for March 2. The off-time in 
between will allow the club to pub-
licize and better prepare, Christian

Christian and Ferasat both 
praised A.S. Co-Festivals 
Coordinator Scott Mantell for all 
the work he has done behind the 
scenes. Calling his efforts "amaz-
ing," Ferasat said Mantell contin-
ues to play a pivotal role in the 
development of Club Ritmo. 

Many non-UCSD students 
were in attendance Friday night for 
the concert as well . 

Mesa College junior Chris Kline 
has been a fan since the beginning. 

"I've been waiting 10 years to see 
this guy in concert ever since I was a 

little kid and 'now 111 finally get a 
chance," Kline said before the show. 

An San Diego State University 
freshman who gave his name as 
"Kipper" said he enjoyed the night 
immensely. 

"I origmally came out to see the 
DJs from the DVC spin because 

. those guys have maximum poten-
tial," Kipper said. "However, I had 
to see Vanilla Ice spin that good 01' 
'Ice Ice Baby' just for the sentimen-
ta l factor. It's a pretty big party ... 
some people may say he kind of 
strayed from the original message 
but it's all good, it's a lot of fun."

Sundance Finale Features Glam Rock 
and Mental Illness 

PARK CITY, Utah - It was an 
emotional night at the 2001 
Sundance Film Festival awards 
ceremony. Nearly all the winners 
were overcome and gracious in 
their acceptance speeches. Since 
several filmmakers received multi-
ple awards, this meant that they 
had to struggle with lumps il) 
thei r th roa ts on multiple occa-
sions. 

The vitality and spirit of rock 
was the big winner. John Cameron 
Mitchell , the star, writer and 
director of the glam-rock musical 
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch," 
picked up the directing award for 
dra ma and shared the audience 
awa rd for drama with the film 's 

p rod uc~rs, Christine Vachon , 
Ka tie Roumel and Pamela Koffl er. 

"Dogtown and Z-Boys," the 
hyperactive and magnetic skate-
board film tha t shows why its sub-
jects - the stars among the 1970s 
Los Angeles concrete daredevils 
- won the ki nd of cultural 
acclaim that they did, also double 
dipped . "Dogtown" was a co-win-
ncr of the audience award fo r doc-
umcnta ries, and its di rector, the 
formcr skateboard hero Stacy 
Peralta, won the di recting award 
for documentaries. 

"Scout's Honor," the docu-
mentary that examines the antigay 

stance of the Boy Scouts of 
America , shared the audience 
award for documentaries with 
"Dogtown ." The producer of 
"Dogtown," Agi Orsi, and the pro-
ducer and director of "Scout's

Expression Award. 

The director Henry Bean 's 
modesty was evident when he 
accepted the Grand Jury Prize for 
Drama for "The Bdiever," a tense 
and involving story of a volatile, 
bright and self-hating young Jew 
caught up in the pretzel logic of 
membership in a fascist move-
ment, when he mentioned what 
led him and his team to subm it 
thei r fi lm to Sundance. "The only 

reason I did it was I was sure we 
wouldn't get in," he said. 

The Jury Prize for 
Documentaries went to 
"Southern Comfort; in which its 
producer and director, Kate Davis, 
tackled one of the most unusual 
subjects of the festival: the fight of 
Robert Eads, a transsexual who 
underwent conversion from 
woman to man, to get treatment 
for ovarian cancer. . 

Christopher Nolan's intricately 
plotted film noir "Memento" won 
the Waldo Salt Screen writing 
Award. "Children Underground," 
Edet Belzberg's documentary 
about an ad hoc family of orphans 
living in a subway station in 
Bucharest, won the special jury 
prize. Giles Ngutten's luscious 
work on the entertaining crime 
melQdrama "The Deep End" was 
selected for the cinematography 
award in drama. 

Sissy Spacek and Tom 
Wilkinson were singled out for 
special jury prizes for their perfor-
mances in Todd Field's austere 
and touching "In the Bedroom," a 
melodrama about the emotional 
disintegration of a family after a 
murder shatters its stability.

In Earthquake Aftermath, Indians Cope 
SHUJ, India - Here, near thc 

epicenter of the earthquake that 
shook the subcontinent Friday, 
thousands are dead and hundreds 
of thousands arc sleeping under 
starry skies in the chi lly wi nter ai r, 
warmed by small campfi res that 
fli cker wherever there is open 
ground. 

The earthquake, the worst in 
India in 50 years, brought whole 
neighborhoods cras hing down on 
the people who were home for 
Republic Day, a national holiday, 
in this city of 150,000 and nearby 
towns in the western state 
Gujarat. 

In Anjar, a town of 35,000 that 
is about 25 miles fro m here, 
between 300 and 400 children 
were killed when bu ildings along 
the lane they were wal king in dur-
ing a Republic Day process ion 
tumbled down upon them, local 
officials sa id. 

The public hospital in Bhuj 
co llapsed, crushing the patients 
and depriving the city of its prima-
Iy medical facility at the moment 
when thousands suddenly needed 
surgery and emergency care.

homeless in his district alone,

a Hindu temple. Kusum Naresh 
Soni, mother of three, is still in the 
apricot colored nightgown she 
was wearing when she ran out of 
her crumbling home. 

"We're sitting here praying to 
God," she said. "We don 't know 

cardinals well above the limit of 
120 set by Pope Paul VI in 1975, 
ra ising it from 128 with last 
week's appointments to 135 now. 
The first time he exceeded that 
limit was in 1998, but only by a 
few. That could be a sign that at 
80, the ailing pope wants to ta ke 
every opportunity left to him to 
shape the College of Cardinals, 
th e institution that will one day 
elect his successor. 

Two Germans, a Bolivian and a 
South African, also named on 
Sunday, 'will be among the many 
who will receive a cardi nal's red 
hat during a consistory on Feb. 
21. Of th e other three, two are 
from Ukraine, a predominantly 
Orthodox country where the main 
Orthodox church, has asked the 

what to do." 
The only way into the ruined 

areas of Bhuj and the two other 
hardest hit towns, Anjar and 
Bachau, is to crawl over moun-
tains of precarious rubble that 
have fallen into the little dirt lanes 
that once ran between buildings. 
The stench of bodies rotting 
beneath the debris hangs heavy. 

Those who survived face 
many miseries. There's no elec-
tricity to give them light, no run-
ning water for bathing and cook-
ing, no working phones on 
which to ca ll loved ones or get 
out the word about the desperate 
conditions here. There are few 
tents so most people are staying : 
out in the open. 

"We are facing a grievous situ-
ation for housing," said Gadhvi, 
who sat beneath a neem tree in 
the courtyard of the district head-
quarters, which partially crumbled 
in the earthquake. "The damage is 
so bad people are living under the

Rumsfeld: 
Secretary must abide by 
strict rules of confidence 
ContI .... froIII ..... 1 
valued at $50 million to $210 mil-
lion, a financial disclosure form 
released last week indicated. 

Nearly half of Rumsfeld's assets 
- $22 million to $99 million - are 
tied up in limited partnerships, 
including venture capital funds 
that invest in the health care, ener-
gy, Internet and biotechnology 
fields, a review of the form showed. 

Like all federal public officials, 
Rumsfeld must abide by strict rules 
on conflicts of interest outlined by 
the Office of Government Ethics, 
but because so many companies do 
business with the Pentagon, he 
must dispose of a significant por-
tion of his portfolio, his financial 
adviser and Pentagon officials said. 

The partnerships could prove 
particularly difficult to walk away 
from without a loss. Such partner-
ships typically require investors to 
make five- to 10-year commit-
ments and often impose penalties 
for early withdrawal. 

During his confirmation hear-
ing on Jan . 11, Rumsfeld acknowl-
edged that he had "a large number 
of investments and activities that 
would have to be characterized as 

'conflicts' were they to be main-
tained during service as secretary of 
defense." 

He pledged to divest himself of 
them, and on the eve of his swear-
ing-in on Jan. 20, Rumsfeld com-
pleted what a 'Pentagon 
spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. 
Quigley, ca lled a "lengthy and com-
plicated agreement" involving the 
ethics office, the Pentagon's gener-
al counsel and the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. 

The agreement spells out the 
investments that Rumsfeld must 
sell and provides a timetable for 
doing so, Quigley said. 

The financial adviser, who 
spoke with the Pentagon's permis-
sion on the condition that he not 
be named, said Rumsfeld needed 
time to notify his investment part-
ners of his divestments and negoti-
ate the terms of his withdrawal. 

"The Rumsfelds have assets that 
are easy to dispose of and . assets 
tha t are not so easy to dispose of," 
the adviser said. 

Rumsfeld, 68, served as chief 
executive officer of G.D. Searle & 
Co., a pharmaceutical business, 
from 1977 to 1985. He1ater served 
as chief executive and chairman of 
General Instruments, the cable and 
television company.

Merrill Lynch Ad 
Campaign Targets Rich 

NEW YORK - A humorous 
book about Wall Street published 
60 years ago sarcastically asked, 
"Where Are the Customers' 
Yachts?" These days, the clients 
that brokerage firms covet have 
their own boats, or at least boat-
loads of money. 

Merrill Lynch & Co., the 
nation's biggest brokerage firm, is 
making no secret of its appetite for 
the upper crust in an advertising 
campaign that begins later this 
week. The advertisements, with the 
actor Steve Martin providing voice-
overs, are aimed at the wealthiest 
households in America, those with 
$1 million or more to invest. 

The advertisements are intend-
ed to fit within Merrill's current 
corporate campaign that carried 
the theme "Be Bullish." But they 
signal a clear departure from previ-
ous campaigns that positioned 
Merrill as a brokerage firm for the 
masses. 

Merrill went so far as to intro-
duce a competitively priced online 
stock-trading service in 1999 that 
was avai lable to anybody with an 
Internet connection and as little as 
$250 to invest. Then, it seemed, 

with both the Lutheran and 
Orthodox Churches. 

Marian Jaworski, 74, the 
Polish-born Roman Catholic 
archbishop in Lviv, Ukraine, near 
the Polish border, and Janis 
Pujats, 70, archbishop of Riga, in 
Latvia, were actually made cardi-
nals in 1998 but their names were 
kept secret, or " in pectore" (with-
in the breast), a practice used for 
prelates who serve in regions 
where their elevation to cardinal 
could prove harmful. 

As of Feb. 21. both men will be 
eligible to vote in a conclave. They 
were not included in the previous 
totals. 

TIle other new cardinal from 
Ukraine is Lubomyr Husar, 67, a 
Ukrainian native whose family fled 

most investors thought they could 
double their money just by logging 
onto the Internet'tlnd snapping up 
shares of the newest technology 
companies. 

Now that investors have been 
reminded that stocks can fall as fast 
as they can rise, Merrill is empha-
sizing the advice its 15.000 brokers 
can provide for "a simple fee." But 
Merrill executives know that the 
firm's services, including tax and 
estate planning and banking, are 
most appealing to people who are 
too rich and too busy to manage 
their own finances. 

That is why the new advertise-
ments are filled with images of 
yachts, seaplanes, rooftop putting 
greens and references to Henry 
David Thoreau. 

"ft 's fascinating to me because 
previously when you thought of 
the wealthy, it wasn't even a mar-
ket, it was a large handful of rich 
people," said Larry Cohen, a direc-
tor at SRI Consulting Business 
In telligence in Princeton, N.). 
"Now it definitely is a market."

in 1944 and has American citizen-
ship. He returned to Ukraine after 
Communism collapsed and was 
'appointed archbishop of the 
Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 
which follows Eastern rites but is 
loyal to Rome. 

"I intend to honor their 
respective churches, which, espe-
cially in the course of the 20th 
century, have been severely tried," 
the pope said of the three men, 
adding that Christians under · 
totalitarianism, "knew how to pay 
witness to' their faith amid suffer-
ing of every kind, not rarely cul-
minating in the sacrifice of their 
life."

Collegiate: 
The drop among Hispanic stu-
dents was the greatest 
ContInued fronI ..... Z 
of freshmen students in minority groups 
dropped. 

Since then, only African-Americans and 
Asian-Americans have experienced a bounce-
back in applicants. However, no grololp has 
reached its previous numbers. 

To help restore the levels of minority enroll-
ment from before Initiative 200, schools in 
Washington need to encourage more minority 
applicants. This is according to a study done by 
University of Washington sociology professor 
Charles Hirschman and sociology doctoral stu-
dent Susan Wierzbicki. On Wednesday, they 
presented and discussed their findings. 

The study, funded by the Andrew W Mellon 
- Foundation, showed that the bulk of the 

declines in minority enrollment statewide came 
from the UW - the state's largest educational 
institution. However, smaller declines were also 
noted in Washington State University, the 
state's other research institution. 

The drop among Hispanic students was 
the most significant, slipping from under 5 
percent of incoming freshmen in 1998 to 
less than 3 percent in 2000. Total underrep-
reSt'nted minorities enrolled in the UW 

- dropped from 9 percent in 1998 to 6 percent 
- in 2000. 

"It's too early to tell if 1-200 will be a long-
term setback in campus diversity," said UW 
President Richard McCormick wiJh regard to 
the study. "It certainly has been a short-term 
one, but we are working around this !n order 
to keep this campus as diverse as possible." 

Hirschman and Wierzbicki concluded in 
their lecture that at least part of the problem 
was in a lack of diverse applications. They 
explained that there were three steps for get-
ting into college - application, admission 
and enrollment. Without the first step, the 
next two are useless. The crucial key is to 
encourage underrepresented minorities to 
apply in ' the first place.

'laybo, Solicits BYU 
Students with Revealing 
Advertl18ments 

PROVO, Utah - Virtuous. Lovely. Of 
good report. We seek after these things. 
Playboy magazine falls into none of the above 
categories, and in living in accordance with 
the Honor Code, Brigham Young University 
students should not be seeking after it. 
However, "Playboy" is seeking after BYU stu-
dents. 

Advertisements offering a special student 
discount for a year's subscription to Playboy 
magazine have been mailed to BYU students, 
as well as Utah County teens, according to the 
Associated Press. 

Eric Lassen, a 22-year-old business major 
from Camarillo, Calif., received one of the 
advertisements, as did his roommates. He said 
that it featured a picture of scantily clad 
women. 

Lassen said he was surprised to receive 
such an advertisement and wondered how 
Playboy got his address. 

Lassen said the advertisement was specific 
in its address. 

The mail was not simply addressed to the 
resident living at Lassen's address, but includ-
ed his name and the names of each of his 
roommates. -

Ryan Cole, 25, a senior from Yorktown, 
Va., also received the mailer. 

"It's such a bad influence," Cole told the 
Associated Press. "It shouldn't be exposed to 
people who are trying to live their lives right." 

Cole's wife, Kimberly, who graduated last 
year in family science, was the one to receive 
the mail, although it was addressed to her 
husband. 

"I was disgusted. I think it's pretty sad that 
(the advertisements) were sent here because 
peopl~ can have a weakness," she said. "The 
Playboy advertisements can prey on people's 
weaknesses and lead to pornography addic-
tion." 

The Playboy advertisements were also 
received in the dormitories. Assistant Director 
of Residence Life Todd Fischio confirmed 
this.

IDDLE 
y now, every UCSD stu-
dent is aware of the com-
plaints. Upon arrival, most 
studcnts are almost imme-
diately disappointed to 

find that our campus is a little differ-
ent than others. The whole college-
town feel that characterizes colleges 
of myth just does not seem relevant 
within our cozy locale of La Jolla . 

Meaning "the jewel" in Spanish, 
La Jolla continues to dazzle newcom-
ers and studcnts alike with its natural 
beauty. It is not uncommon to hear it 
described as "the most beautiful place 
in the world." UCSD is lucky to have 
such a delightful place as its backyard'. 

Unfortunately, while many stu-
dents are very contcnt with the acad-
emic climate of UCSD, they still man-
age to be considerably discontent 
with our college's social cnvironment. 
The complaints about nothing to do 
on campus are rampant and indeed, 
unjustifiable. However, the communi-
ty surrounding UCSD is another 
issue altogether. 

Ask almost any student what they 
know about the "city" they attend 
school in nine months out of the year, 
and nearly everyone would give you 
limited information, at best. Or even 
worse, many students simply sub-
scribe to the most popular stereotypes 
about La Jollans. A group of rich, 
snobby, uncooperative people is 
probably what your average UCSD 
student would have to say about 
them. 

But exactly how true is this state-
ment? What are the residents really 
like and how has it affected the social 
dynamics of UCSD? Read further to 
find out ". 
A ConInIunity of .... DI ...... 

Officially, La Jolla is not even a 
city, although most students are prob-
ably una~are of this. According 
to Barry Benintende, an editor 
of The La jolla Light and 

unoffi-

cial expert on all things La Jollan, La 
Jolla is actually a township. 

"It's a community of San Diegans; 
very rich San Dicgans," Benintende 
said. 

Benintende added that La Jolla has 
representation in the San Diego city 
council and carries out its civic func-
tions in the form of multiple councils 
and committees. 

The history of UCSD is a good 
place to start when trying to under-
stand why the campus is set up the 
way it is. As for the complaints that 
there are not enough things that cater 
to college students, the origins of the 
university are an appropriate avenue 
to explore, also. 

Or even wor~e, many 
students simply subscribe 
to the most popular 
stereotypes about La 
Jollans. A group oj rich, 
snobby, uncooperative 
people is probably what 
your average UCSD 
student would have to say 
about them. 

La Jolla was a very well-established 
community before Roger Revelle first 
presented to uc regents in 1959, the 
idea for a university on land that pre-
viously belonged to the U.S. military. 
Residents initially feared the great 

change that the then proposed 
UC La Jolla could possibly 
inflict on their small com-
munity. Although over the 

decades, La Jollans have 
adapted to the change, and 

indeed in some cases, residents 
have embraced the university, 
some things have never 
changed. 

"There is a comfort 
level in [La JollansJ 
lives that they don't 
want a lot of change," 
Benintende said. "It's 
not that the people 
here are snobbish it's 
just that they may not 

reach out to 
UCSD students 
as a whole as 

much as they 
could." 
For him, however, it 

could be a two-

way street. Students should be just as 
involved with the community if they 
have complaints, he said. If the stu-
dents want to be more involved, he 
added, they should do more volunteer 
work and get in touch with the com-
munity. According to him, most stu-
dents might be surprised to find how 
responsive the La Jolla community 
would be. if they made an effort to 
reach out. 

"Most residents, I would figure. are 
very receptive to students because 
most of them have children," 
Benintende said. "The supposition 
that La Jolla is anti-college may be 
true in some cases, but I think most of 
the residents are reasonable to know 
that there's something to be gained 
from embracing the students. I'd say 
it's a 50-50 mix as far as people that 
really look at UCSD students as 
assets and who realize that the uni-
versity is here to stay." . 

The dot-com boom in recent years 
has caused a surge in the number of 
young millionaires moving into the 
area, according to Benintende. 
The Resident. 

"I would venture to say that [new-
comers] want to provide for their 
families," Benintende said. "A lot of La 
Jollans are family people, while a huge 
chunk is the senior citizen popula-
tion. If you factor in the senior citi-
zens and students, that's the high and 
low end of the age bracket. The more 
sympathetic crowd toward college 
students tend to be the small bracket 
of young adults who might be just out 
of college." 

La Jolla is no stranger to "new 
money" and newcomers from all over 
the country continually move into the 
area because of the allure La Jolla 
offers, particularly for new families 
raising cliildren. 

The Scarbroughs, who just arrived 
from Utah less than a year ago with 
their infant son, described how warm 
and friendly La Jollans have been to 
them. 

"I think they're pretty friendly, 
actually; quite outgoing and very laid 
back," said Nicole Scarbrough. 
"[They are] very helpful. usu-
ally quite thoughtful which 
is nice." 

Most students have the 
idea that a typical La Jollan 
would be 'almost impossi-
ble to approach . The 
wealth many of these resi-
dents possess is almost 

, enough of an intimidation

Associate Features Editor 

Chivalry is dead. 
Living in America, we are con-

stantly told about the historic 
importance of graciousness, and 
the defense of decency. What we 
often fail to understand, however, 
is that in many non-American 
cultures, chivalry cannot be dead, 
because it never existed in the 
first place. In many of these cul-
tures, including my own Indian 
culture, chivalry is virtua lly 
nonexistent. Chauvinism rims 
rampant among the p~opl e of 
these societies. 

Listen up, men and women of 
UCSD - reading this just may 
provide you with a different per-
spective on the way in which you 
live your life. Perhaps it will make 
you think twice about any pre-
conceived notions you hold 
regarding the opposite sex. If not, 
that's OK too. At least I would 
have made my point, and hope-
fully it will lead some of you to 
look more closely at your own 
experiences, to see if this applies 
to you. 

Some of you are probably 
wondering where exactly I am 
going with this whole spiel. Let 
me be a li ttle more specific. In 
our seemingly progressive soci-
ety, one would assume that both 
male and fe male individua ls 
would oppose such a gender-spe-
cific typology. Unfortunately, the 
notion of gender roles still exists 

The UCSD Guardian 

While Chivalry May be 
Dead in America, It Nev~r 
Existed in Other Cultures 

today. Forget chivalry, even 
equality among the sexes is con-
sidered nonexistent in many cul-
tures. 

This has become a source of 
argument between myself and a 
male friend of mine, who is also of 
Indian descent. 

In our seemingly 
progressive society, one 
would assume that both 
male and female 
individuals would oppose 
such a gender-specific 
typology. Unfortunately, 
the notion of gender roles 
still exists today. Forget 
chivalry, even equality 
among the sexes is 
considered nonexistent in 
many cultures. 

Upon seeing me and my 
roommate cooking dinner last 
year, my friend - who is also a 
self-proclaimed male chauvinist 
- uttered the four words that 
would make any woman's blood 
boil. "That's a woman's job: he 
said. 

He then proceeded to tell me 
his backward, ludicrous notions . 
that a woman's place was in the 
home, and that a woman's job was 

to serve her husband. 
Rather than abiding by our 

instincts and beating our friend 
over the head with a frying pan, 
my roommate and I instead rolled 
our eyes and told our friend that 
he needed to update his prehis-
toric views if he ever wanted to 
meet a respectable girl. 

He responded by saying that if 
he was not able to find a woman 
in America who possessed the 
willingness to go along with his 
definition of a "dutiful" wife, then 
he would simply find his future 
wife in India. I refuted his com-
ment by telling him that what he 
wanted was a maid/babysitter! 
chef, and not a wife. 

Later that day, however, I 
began to think about the state-
ments that my friend had made. I 
began to wonder if his views were 
representative of other males my 
age. 

All sorts of thoughts began to 
surface in my mind. "Did these 
men still possess such absurd 
views?" "Where did these views 
originate?" "Was I the only one 
bothered by his comments?" and 
"God ... I hope that I am not des-
tined to marry someone who pos-
sesses ideas as crazy as my 
friend 's." 

After talking with some 
friends of mine who are also of 
South-Asian descent, I realized 
that the typical Indian male men-
tality is alive and quite prevalent

La Jolla: 
Community does not

ContInued from .,... 13 
factor to stop even the bravest stu-
dents from striking up a sponta-
neous conversation with an aver-
age resident. 

Out-of-towners like Jared 
Scarbrough think the situation is 
not as black and white, however, 
especia lly in comparison to other 
parts of the country. 

"I think in Utah it's easier to get 
to know people and make a con-
nection: he said. "But I think here 
once you make the connection it's 
a stronger connection [becauseJ 
they're more friendly, helpful and 
more genuine. Once you break 
down that initial barrier they're 
very open and kind people but ( 
th ink on the outside, there's that 
barrier that you need to break 
through." 

Ralph Nedelkoff, a resident of 
La Jolla for only 6 months, original-
ly from New Jersey, has found the 
community very welcoming. 

"It's a wonderful community; 
he said. UEverybody I've met, 
whether they're students or not 
students." 

ewcomers from around the 
world are also common within the 
community of La Jolla. Fresh from 
St. Andrews, Scotland, is young 
couple Tom and Sharon Henley. 
According to the two, the social cli-
mate of La Jolla is not entirely 
unique. 

"Probably Scotland would be a 
wee bit more warm and people who 
moved in next door would have 
you come around or say hello," 
Torn Henley said. "I guess it's like 
any big city really; London would 
be the same - you wouldn't know 
your next-door neighbors." 
Why No College Town? 

An all-too-familiar complaint is 
that we lack a college town or any 
semblance of a college-town com-
munity. The most popular compar-
isons would have to be universities 
such as UCLA; UC Berkeley and 
SDSU. True as it may be that each 
of those colleges might have an 
edge over ours in terms of more 
college-friendly establishments 
surrounding their campuses, some 
would argue that UCSD and La 
Jolla needn't change at all. 

For instance, Naureen Nayyar, 
an ex-SDSU student who is now in 

FEATURES 1S 

her second year at Mesa College, is 
quick to point out the benefits of 
UCSD being situated in 3n area 
like La Jolla . For instance, she 
points out how she prefers the 
quiet and peacefulness only La 
Jolla can provide. (n addition, he is 
more optimistic about UCSD's 
social milieu . 

"I have a lot of friends who go to 
UCSD, and they have a lot of fun 
just partying in their dorms and 
stuff, too," she said. "( mean, you 
can make any place happen if you 
want it. College life is what you 
make of it. (t's not just about party-
ing - there are people who like to 
just chill." 

Nayyar went on to express how 
she fee ls UCS D students should 
take more time to appreciate what 
they already have. 

"I think a lot of times when peo-
ple go, 'Oh 1 want it more like a col-
lege town,' they're not thinking, 
'Oh I want more places for kids to 
just hang out after 10,''' she said. 
"They're talking about places to 
party and stuff, like PB. lIn PBJ, 
everybody's just drinking every-
where and it's so loud, I mean 1 live 
in PB right now and sometimes it's 
kind of annoying how every day is 
a party." 

Mandeville Special Collections 
Library Director Lynda Corey 
Claassen believes the reason to be 
mostly circumstantial. The area 
surrounding UCSD is predomi-
nantly residential instead of com-
mercial. It is important to note that 
UCSD is situated on a hill, conve-
niently tucked away from the rest 
of La Jolla. 

Unlike places like Westwood for 
UCLA or Berkeley for Cal, UCSD 
never developed in a student-
friendly area that was contiguous 
to the campus. On t p of that, our 

univers~ty is a far younger school 
and has not had as much time to 
develop and mature into a thriving 
college comm unity, in the tradi-
tional sense. 

The culture of La Jolla has man-
aged to remain intact, however. 
According to Claassen, it is a 
dynamic mix of art, culture, social 
events and social interaction . 
Dlstanc. From the Community 

Perhaps the biggest culprit, as 
far as UCSD's distance from the 
community, is the geography itself. 

The re lationship between 
UCSD and La Jolla was and is ten-
tative. As a university, it is primari-

Soapbox: 
Some men need to rethink 
their ideal woman 
c.an. ... froM ..... 14 

t~ay. Perh.lIps I had been naive to 
thmk that Just because in my own 
family "gender roles' did not 
apply, that these labels did not 
transcend into other minority 
households. 

Many of my peers have told me 
that gender roles are an accepted 
reality in their 0\\lJ1 families. One 
friend, whose parents both hold 
full time jobs, told me that each 
evening after returning home from 
work, her mother is expected to 
cook dinner fo r. She is also expect-
ed to clean up after the rest of the 
filmily while her father enjoys 
leisure time watching TV or read-
ing. 

I was shocked to fi nd out that 
her father had never before 
washed a single dish or done one 
load of laundry. While I found th is 
behavior very dis turbing, my 
friend had simply accepted it as a 
way of li fe. Her description 
remiQded me more of a business 
than of a fa mily. Author Li ll ian 
jlell put it best when she said, "It is 
rea lly .asking too much of a 
woma n to expect her to bring up 
her husband and her children 
too." 

Although I know of no woman 
my age who would tolerate this way 
of life, I also recognize that as long 
as societies continue to promote 
and tolerate the idea of gender 
roles, there wi ll always be men who 

abide by it, and women who put up 
with it. 

Here I was, thinking that the 
days in which women were consid-
ered subordinate to men were long 
~one. Little did I know that these 
Ideas are still 'alive and well among 
males of my own generation. Only 
by refusing to conform to or par-
take in these silly, stereotypical 
gender roles, can we put a stop to 
this inane way of thinking. 

The problem lies in the fact that 
the men who possess such silly 
notions, do so because of the way 
they were brought up. Most were 
the typical "mama's boys' who 
were never given any responsibili-
ties, and who, even at a young age, 
were treated like royalty. Welcome 
to reality, boys. If the only th ing 
you want is someone to clean your 
house, hire a maid. 

Well, as a sidenote to my poor, 
foolish friend who feels that he is 
going to find the "perfect woman' 
who will be willing to cook, clean 
and abide by her husband's every 
wish, good luck. Any woman that 
puts up with such dictatorship is 
badly in need of a crash .course in 
being independent. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I am 
not a vi ndictive person, and my 
purpose is not to las h out at all 
men - only those who are foolish 
enough to believe such silly ideas. 
And to all you males who still 
thi nk that a woman's place is in 
the home, you'd might as well see 
bachelorhood as a permanent way 
of life, because the only place you 
are going to get "service with a 
smi lc' is at your local Burger 
King.

Exceptions most definitely exist, 
but generally speaking, each entity 
has its own specific interests, and 
tends to not understand each

Nancy Groves, director of aca-
demic advising at Revelle and a 
resident of the area for 37 years, 
mentioned that La Jolla has tried 
to respond to the location difficul-
ties UCS D students may come 
across. For instance, La Jolla 
Village Square only became as 
student friendly as it is today in 
recent years becausc the local 
businesses realized that providing 
more services to the massive stu-
dent population was the only way 
to survive economically. 
UCSD Student Penpectlv ••

UCS D student Shiloh Talley 
believes La Jolla's natural splendor 
to be one of its greatest assets. 

"La Jolla is one of the most 
beautiful places in the United 
States with the most beautiful 
people around," Talley said. 

She, like many others, endorses 
a more proactive approach to alle-
viate the common complaint that 

there is nothing to do on campus. 
"I think you have to make your 

own fun, but as UCSD students 
we're all capable of doing that. 
Otherwise we wouldn't have come 
here," she said. "We came here for 
the beauty of it and there's so 
many beautiful things to do that 
we should be satisfied." 

Some students like Revelle 
sophomore Ben Mayes are hardly 
concerned with connecting with

La Jo llans outside the university . 
Being a student is of utmost prior-
ity for students like him. 

"Our problem isn't all that 
unique, really." Mayes said. "You 
can't expect the community to be 
involved with us. I mean there are 
variations, some colleges will 
interact more with the community 
than others but all in all you kind 
of don't expect it because [stu-
dents and La Jollansllive such dif-
ferent lifestyles." 

UCSD senior Bobby Potruch 
works at one of the many booths 
at UTe. Dealing with all sorts of 
people every day, Potruch attests 
to the claim that La Jollans are a 

FEATURES 17 

very diverse group, despite most 
stereotypical perceptions of them. 
Like many other students who 
deal with La Jollans on a regular 
basis, he remarked how labeling 
the entire community as one thing 
would be inaccurate. 

Potruch maintains that La 
Jolla, like any community near a 
big city, is a mix of all ages and 
types of people who surprisingly 
are a varied mix even from an eco-
nomic standpoint. In other words, 
not everyone is filthy rich, 
although most are. 

In response to claims that 
UCS D or La Jolla lacks a collegc-
town feel , Potruch recites a famil-
ia r sentiment shared by many stu-
dents. According to him, for any-
one who's ever been to a college-
town, UCSD is "definitely no col-
lege town." 

As examples, Potruch cited 
how the conservative nature of 
UCSD neighbors prevents there 
from being action such as parties 
on campus which are not almost 
immediately broken up. Much 
like students before him, Potruch 
remains far more optimistic 
about the opportunities UCSD 
has to offer socially. He poses the 
challenge that all students look 
within themselves to change their 
attitudes before whining about 
how UCSD lacks yet another 
thing. 

"If you've ever spoken to most-
ly anyone, they're always looking 
for something outside their town," 
Potruch said. "Their town is bor-

Horoscopes: 
See what the future holds 
for Vtrgo, Libra and more 
ness on Wednesday, because a 
strong reprimand from the boss 
awaits you on Thursday if you 
don't. Pay attention to what you're 
doing on Friday, too, because the 
person who signs your paycheck is 
definitely doing that. You're so 
popular this weekend, you may 
have ~rouble .keeping all your 
commitments. Save the end of 
Sunday for personal contempla-
tion. 

VI,.o (Aug. 23-Sept . 22) 
The better you keep somebody 

else's money in order on Monday 
and Tuesday, the better you look. 
Don't get too playfu[ Wednesday, 
or you'll forget to do something 
imponant. That could lead to trou-
ble on Thursday, when work inter-
feres with your playtime. Don't let 
your mate s remark upset you on 
Friday. Something your mate 
believes is too hard will actually be 
easy for you. Help an older person 
over the weekend. This won't bring 
money or even recognition, but it's 
good for you. 

u ..... (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 
Your mate is very directive on 

Monday and Tuesday. It'll be fun, 
provided you can go along with 
your partner's ~ suggestions. 
However, don't let your mate spend 
all of your money on Wednesday or 
Thursday. You might be enticed 
into making a commitment Friday 
around dinnertime. Travel and 
games both go well over the week-
end, but be careful. [f you hurry, 
the job may have to be done over 
again. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24·Nov. 21) 
A co-worker 's snide remark 

could get you agitated on Monday 
or Tuesday, but don 't despair - it's 
going to motivate you. Get a pan-
ner to help you solve a tough prob-
lem at homl;, on Wednesday or 
Thursday. This is too complicated 
for you to deal with all by yourself. 
If shopping is required, go Friday. 
With your partner's help, you can 
get the very thing you need. Do 
some of the work yourself this 
weekend, then go out to dinner to 
spend what you saved. 

........... (Nov. 22·Dec , 21) 
You'd rather stay home and play 

with your sweetheart on Monday 
and Thesday. Do that 'as much as 
you can. The work starts pouring 
In around Wednesday. There wiD 
be complications on Wednesday 
and Thursday. Misunderstandings 
and haste makes waste on Friday. 
Your panner may be in an argu-
mentative mood over the weekend. 
He or she is so cute, it won't be 
hard to acquiesce. And if you do, he 
or she will think you're pretty cute, 
too. 

C ... rIconI (Dec. 22·Jan. 19) 
A home-based enterprise could 

be quite profitable Monday and 
Thesday. Devote more time to your 
sweethean Wednesday and 

· Thursday. Playtime is important to 
· staying healthy, and it's also imP'?r-
· tant to keep your priorities straight.

has in store for you . 
ContInued from pep 18 
in late FridllY, and that assignment 
could last through the weekend. 
But it might be best not to work on 
Sunday, when a breakdown could 
make the job take even longer. 
..... (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 

Dig for the information you 
need on Monday and Tuesday -
you'll find it. Slow down Wednesday 
and Thursday, take the time to look 
for errors. The more you find then, 
the better off you'll be on Friday, 
when your work is put to the test. 
By Friday afternoon the worst is 
over, so set up a date for that night. 
'Spend time with your sweethean 
rather than with a colleague on 
Saturday. Chores may disrupt your 
play schedule on Sunday. 

PI_ (Feb, 19-March 20) 
You may be worried about 

money Monday and Thesday, but 
it's not that you don't have enough. 

M~re likely, you've found too many 
- ways to spend it. You'll make it go a 

_ lot funher by shopping wisely on 
Wed~esday and Thursday. An item 

La Jolla: 
Some students are happy 
with the communi~ 

never anything to do; it's always try-
ing to get out of your local environ-
ment. And it seems like the popular 
thing to say is that there's nothing 
to do." 

Instead of blaming the lack of 
parties, Potruch thinks in many 
cases, it is the students themselves 
who never really learned how to 
have fun because of the academic 
nature of UCSD. 

"[t's a very competitive school 
where people spent a great deal of 
time in their high schools worry-
ing about their grades to get into 
a prestigious school ," Potruch 

you've been seeking for your home 
becomes available Friday. Fixing up 
your home is the perfect project for 
this weekend. Don't wait for 
another to do for you. 

BlrtIIdIIy. TIll. Week 
Jan. 29: Your energy level is high 

this year, so use it. You're extremely 
smat:t. so don't hold back. . 

Jan. 30: Others marvel at your 
prowess this year. Strut your stuff 
and don't hold back. You didn't get 
this good by accident; you worked at 
it. . 

Jan. 31 : You're putting down 
roots, and it's about time. A goal ' 
you've ~n after for ages can finally 
be yours. 

Feb. 1: Something you've been 
putting up with at home could 
become intolerable. Make the 
changes you've been thinking about 
for so long. 

Feb. 2: There's a conflict between 
career and family, Look at other 
options in February, then make up 
your mind in March. 

Feb. 3: Your romantic fantasies 
can come true. It's not quite by acci-
dent, even though the way things 
turn out might be rather surprising. 

Feb. 4: You're looking good, and 
you attract very interesting people. 
An argument in March narrows the 
field. 

said. "Now that they're in college, 
they're looking to party and they 
don't know how to do it. They 
don't know what it is. They're par-
tying and they still don't know 
they're partying. They think you 
have to be at some rager with five 
kegs where you can't move and 
that's a party; that's technically a 
party but also partying is going 
out with a few of your buddies 
and hanging out. You don't have 
to stay out tm 3 a.m . to be classi-
fied as a coo[ person who had a 
good time." 

Potruch agrees. 
UYou can bring fun to almost 

any town," Potruch said. U[t's not 
that much to search for, you'll go 
your whole entire college life 
searching for it and it was sitting 
right in front of you the whole time 
and you never knew it was there."

XFL Offers 
More Than 
Just Football 

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

Anew television experience will be brought to life next week. It will be entertain-
ing. It will be ruthless. It will 
involve cutthroat tactics. 0 , I do 
not mean "Survivor II." I am talking 
about the Extreme Football 
League, or XFL. 

The XFL is being brought to us 
by those fine folks at BC and 
Vince McMahon, he of World 
Wrestling Federation fame. See, 

BC got outbid a couple of years 
ago to air the NFL. Now all the 
network has is NBA basketball, in 
addition to the occasional 
Olympics. So, without the NFL, 

BC decided to create a league of 
its own. 

McMahon was more than 
happy to get on this. He is, serious-
ly, a marketing and entertainment 
genius. I am not a wrestling fan by 
any means, but the industry makes 
millions of dollars a year, has scores 
of adoring fans, and even I know 
who The Rock is. 

The XFL promises to be foot-
ball at its best. It is supposed to be 
a purer form of the game. See, the 
NFL has become somewhat of a 
sissy league. I am not calling the 
likes of Junior Seau and Ray Lewis 
sissies (I'm not that stupid), but 
there are a number of things in the 
game that have taken away from its 
toughness. 

One example is the "in the 
grasp" rule. This means that if a 
quarterback's progress is impeded, 
if a defender has an arm on him 
and the guy can't move, then the 
play is over without the quarter-
back ever being tackled. Yes, for an 
"in the grasp," they remove tack-
ling. I think that is ridiculous. If the 
quarterback is too fragile to get 
thrown to the turf, then he should 
take up golf. 

Another rule in the FL is the 
fair catch. When a ball is punted, 
the guy receiving can ca ll a fair 
catch, meaning he can catch the 
ball without getting hit, but the 
play is over. Again, taking the vio-
lence out of football. Sorry guys, 
but football is violent. It isn 't 
checkers. 

The XFL promises to play real 
football. Hitting, tackling and some 
vio lence will return to a violent 
sport. 

Also, the XFL will allow cele-
brations. The NFL, or "No Fun 
League" does not allow touchdown 
celebrations. Good sportsmanship 
or something like that. Not in the 
XFL. If you're good, you can flaunt 
it. If you stink, get off the field. 

The XFL will be filled with a lot 
of gimmicks. Announcers in the 
stands. Cameras everywhere. God 
knows what else, we'll just have to 
wait and see. 

And the cheerleaders. Have you 
seen them? They look like strip-
pers. Not to say that's a bad thing. 

I don't know if the XFL will be 
more sports or entertainment. It 
can't be all football, or it will go 
away like the USFL or the World 
League (which is still around but 
not stateside). We have football 
already. We need football and

PORTS. 
Women Excel in .Overtime 
The women's basketball team digs down deep to bury Grand 
Canyon in double overtime and evens its record to 6-6 · 
By ARVIND VA.AN 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a thriller at home, the UCSD 
women's basketball team 
improved its overall record to 10-7 
and its league record to 6-6 by 
defeating Grand Canyon 
University 91-78. 

In the first half, the Tritons 
came out a bit off. They took 21 
shots, making only 8. Grand 
Canyon was also a mediocre 33 
percent shooting in the first half, 
and at that halfs close, the UCSD 
Tritons were up by only a single. 
P9 in t. 

The second half was a different 
story. Both teams were hot from 
the field, shooting over 40 percent. 
The three-point shooting kept 
Grand Canyon in the game, as it 
made three out of four in the sec-
ond half. 

When the second half came to 
a close, the game went into over-
time with the score 62-62. 

In the first overtime, it was 
obvious that both teams were a 
bit tired. The two teams had a 
combined point total of 16 (8 for 
each team) so another overtime 
session was needed to decide the 
game. 

In the secoQd overtime, UCSD 
kicked it into overdrive and took 
Grand Canyon right out of the 
game. It went on a 21-8 run to seal 
the deal and to defeat Grand 
Canyon University for the second 
time this season . 

"Everyone did their part in the 
victory: said senior Ashley 
Kokjohn. "When the game went 
into double OT, we were able to 
keep our momentum and escape 
with a victory. I am not sure why 

they couldn't hold up in the sec-
ond overtime, maybe because they 
haven 't traveled enough this sea-
son, but our team played great and 
came up big down the stretch: 

The fabulous three for the 
Thitons came up big in this game: 
Genevieve Ruvald had 19 points, 
and Maya Fok and Nicholle 
Bromley each had 17. Each is 
averaging in double figures for the 
season. 

Kokjohn, the rebounding 
leader for the team, was excellent 
on the glass, grabbing 10 
rebounds, including six offensive 
boards that gave UCSD second-

. chance opportunities. The assist 
leader on the team, Fok, dished 
out nine to aid the cause. 

"The rookies are doing a good 
job adjusting to the level of play 
this season," Kokjohn said. "With 
Kimberly Neal out for maybe the 
rest of the season, the rookies will 
need to pick up the slack, which 
they have done." 

When asked about how the 
Tritons prepare for their oppo-
nents, Kokjohn responded by say-
ing that they just take "each game 
at' a time" because no opponent is 
a pushover and the team looks to 
·surprise some teams that may 
underestimate them this season: 

The seniors have stepped up 
for the team, as Ruvald and 
Kokjohn have done their jobs 
both on offense and defense. 
Neal, the only other senior on the 
team, got injured and might be 
out of for the rest of the season. 
Yet for some of the new under-
classman, the seniors have truly 
helped their transition to colle-
giate basketball. 

"I can see the difference in the

Men's Volleyball Overcome by Pepperdine 
After overcoming the Waves in the first set, UCSD falters and drops the last three games 
By .eon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team hosted the Pepperdine Waves 
Friday at RJMAC Arena for a night 
of rock 'em, sock 'em VOlleyball 
action. However, the Pepperdine 
players were less than gracious 
guests, putting the hurt on the 
Tritons in their own house in front 
of the 298 spectators in atten-
dance. 

The men's volleyball team got a 
taste of a new game format, as it 
now uses rally scoring on every 
point, with the first four games 
played to 30 points, and the fifth 
game, if necessary, played to 15. It 
only took the Waves four games to 
down the Tritons, en route to 
rolling up a 3-1 victory over the 
home team. 

UCSD got out to an early lead, 
winning the first set 30-28. This 
marked the first winning set of the 

season for the Tritons, but this 'was 
all they could muster, dropping 
the next three by scores of 30-18, 
30-21 and 30-22. 

Matt Shawley led the Waves 
with 14 kills in the match. 
Teammate Fred ' Winters had 12 
kills, while Brad Keenan and Scott 
Wong had 10 kills each. Their 
attack was made possible by setter 
Keith Barnett, who compiled 50 
assists in the tilt. 

The Tritons were led by the 
exploits of 2000 MVP Donald 
Chen, who had 16 kills in the 
effort. Griffin Cogorno, in his first 
year playing for the Tritons, also 
exhibited inspired llay, knocking 
down 15 kills an notching 10

kills of his own, while Eric Perrine
