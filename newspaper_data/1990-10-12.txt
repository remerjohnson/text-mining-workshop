A.S. Postpones RIMAe Decision 
• Marathon meeting ends with open-roll vote on McKay's resolution 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Guardian Reporter 

A seven-and-a-half hour Associated Stu-
dents meeting Wednesday night ended with 
an open-roll vote on a controversial Recre-
ational/lntramural Athletic and Events Cen-
ter (RIMAC) resolution that will not be com-
pleted until 4:30 p.m. today. 

The resolution, authored by A.S. Vice 
President External Molly McKay, calls on the 
administration to allow greater student input 
intoRIMAC. 

McKay's resolution also asks administra-
tors to give a prompt, fair, and impartial 
hearing to outstanding student grievances that 
last spring's RIMAC referendum was tainted 
by biased brochures and other possible elec-
tion violations. 

In addition, the resolution recommends 
that a student-only committee be formed to 
investigate the impact of campus-based fees 
and the circumstances surrounding the insti-
tution of such fees. 

However, the resolution does recognize 
that a recreationallintramural facility is needed 
at UCSD. 

Wednesday night ' s vote showed ten 
council members in favor of the resolution 
and six members against, with four members 
absent from the meeting. Because the four 
members not present could have caused a tie 
vote on the resolution, it was moved to an 
open-roll vote. 

Under the terms of the vote, voting mem-
bers of the A.S. council who were not present 
Wednesday night have until this afternoon to 
cast their votes. In the event of a tie, Council 
Chairman Ruben Duran would cast the de-
ciding vote. 

Council members participated in a lengthy 
debate about the problems accompanying both 
RIMAC and McKay's resolution. 

During the meeting, McKay urged the 
council to speak up for students by passing the 
resolution, while A.S. President John Edson 
recommended using time as an agent for 
compromise between the needs of the students 
and the administration. 

McKay accused the administration of 
"screwing" the students by not representing 

them fairly in a flawed election, and not 
giving them enough control over the RIMAC 
'1 cility:-which is to be partially funded by a 
$70 raise in quarterly fees when the facility 
opens. 

"We have to take a stand," McKay de-
manded, "the students are being manipulated 

like puppets." 
University of California Student Associa-

tion (UCSA) member Jeremy Pasternak 
agreed.

Mini-Dorm Meeting Centers on Ordinance 
• Wolfsheimer's proposal would limit off-campus student housing 
By Kent Korzon 
Senior Staff Writer 

At Monday 's meeting of the San Diego 
Transportation and Land Use Committee, 
Deputy Mayor Abbe Wolfsheimer unveiled 
her proposal to create a new city ordinance 
designed to eliminate off-campus student mini-
dorms. 

In her memorandum to the committee, 
Wolfsheirner elaborated on her overall view 
of the problem, citing the "lack of affordable 
rental housing for San Diego' sstudcnts. Forced 
to share expenses by crowding into homes in 
low density neighborhoods, the students bring 
with them the impacts of high density. " 

According to John Nunes of UCSD's 
Community Relations Department, roughly 
62 percent of UCSD's students live off-
campus. 

Wolfsheimer's six-point solution would 
first define a "single residence" as a dwelling 
unit with a single kitchen, then substitute the 
term "single residence zoning" for "single 
family zoning." 

"Residential use" would be distinguished 
from "business or conunercial use," which 
requires a license. 

The definition of business or conunercial 
use would include the enterprise of a lessor 
collecting rent (directly or indirectly) from 
more than one lessee or sub-lessee living on 
"single resident" leased premises. 

The city would then "enforce prohibition 
of business or commercial uses in • single 
residence' zones," according to Wolfsheimer's 
proposal. 

Wolfsheimer's legislation, if approved, 
would also regulate business or commercial 
leaseholds in "multi-residence" zones to re-
quire "one bedroom of no less than 70 square 
fect for every adult, one bathroom for every 
two adults, and one off-street parking space 
for every car operated by an adult living on the 
premises." 

Civil fmes and penalties will be imposed 
on those individuals using "single residence" 
zones for conunercial purposes and on those 
who fail to meet the square footage, bathroom, 
kitchen and parking requirements in "multi-
residence" zones. 

San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner, 
who voted against Wolfsbeimer's proposal, 
said it "will lead to discrimination" and is 
"inappropriate. " 

"[Wolfsheimer'sproposal] won 't stand up 
to reality," Filner said. "You' ve got all klnds ... 
seniors who live together on a fixed income, 
urunarried couples ... [Wolfsheimer] thinks 
she's found a way that's legally okay [to 
legislate]. " 

Milton Phegley, UCSD campus commu-
nity planner, said, "Whether the university 
takes a position or not is going to be based on 
the reasonableness of the program." 

In her memorandum, Wolfsheimer out-
lined her legal strategy for enacting the leg-
islation. 

The legislation's language would seek to 
avoid a problem similar to legislation re ult-
ing from the Anderson case in Santa Barbara, 
which was overturned by the State Supreme 
Court. 

In the Anderson case, the court ruled that 
"regulation of the number of unrelated adults 
living in the same household, as a family, 
violates a right to privacy (under the criminal 
case of White vs. Davis). 

"Therefore, the government mu t prove a 
compelling interest for such regulation -
instead of enjoying the presumption on its

Researchers Make Breakthrough 
In Study of Neutrino 'Aavors' 

A team of researchers from Los Alamos National 
Laboratory, an institution managed by the University of 
Califomia,joined physicists and chemists from Louisiana 
State University, Princeton University, University of 
Pennsylvania, and from the Soviet Union in tests slated to 
explain why previous experiments done on neutrinos 
have con istently failed to result in predicted Quantities. 

The initial findings of the Soviet-American Gallium 
Experiment (S.A.G.E.] suggest that solar neutrinos oscil-
late between one of three known types, or "flavors," 
making it difficult for researchers to measure exact numbers 
of these subatomic partic1es, as they were only measuring 
one specific "flavor." 

With S.A.G.E., it is the absence of observable neutri-
nos that has physicists excited. 

"What we're seeing is probably the first indication of 
new particle physics - evidence of a new physical 
phenomenon previously theorized but never before 0b-
served," said Peter Rosen, fonner staff member of Los 
Alamos and internationally recognized neutrino e pert. 
Rosen believes that S AG.E. will eventually disprove the 
notion that neutrinos have precisely zero mass. 

"For a neutrino to change flavors, or oscillate, it has to 
have some mass, no mamer how small, according to the 
laws of Quantum mechanics," he said. 

The S.A.G.E. collaboration was formed in 1986 when 
the Soviets invited a number of American scientists, 
headed by a team at Los Alamos, to participate in agalIium 
solar neutrino experiment initiated 20 years ago by the 
lnstitute forNuc1earResearch of the Academy of Sciences 
of the USSR. 

S.A.G.E., unlike other solar neutrino experiments, is 
mostly sensitive to low-energy neutrinos which are more 
sensitive to the sun's primary energy source. 

The other neutrino experiments detect high-energy 
neutrinos, whosenumbersaremoresensitivetothedetails

University CitY murders, stating that Pamela Oarlc, 42, 
and her 18-year-old daughter Amber were stabbed to 
death with one of their own knives. 

While no mwder weapon was found in the January 
death of Tiffany Schultz, 20, the police did recover 
knives they believe were used for victims Janene 
Weinhold, 21, and Holly TarT,18. 

According to the polkle, tfle mwder weapon used 
against Weinhold was a knife from the butcher block in 
Weinhold's kitchen. The murderer left the knife in the 
kitchen sink with the water running. 

The police say that the knife used against TarT was 
believed to have been taken from a drying rack in the 
kitchen. The killer dropped the knife as he fled the 
scene. 

Investigators into the case have also noted other

Math Professor Michael Freedman 
Named 'Hot Scientist' by Fortune 
By Eric Schmidt 
Guardian Report8f' 

UCSD Math Professor Michael 
Freedman added to an already im-
pressive list ofhonors recently when 
Fortune magazine recently named 
him one of the 12 "hot young sci-
entists" in the United States in its 
Oct. 8 issue. 

Fortune selected Freedman for 
his breakthrough discovery in to-
pology, a branch of mathematics 
dealing with features that can not be 
lost if an object is deformed. 

Freedman said that he finds this 
area of mathematics particularly 
interesting because it deals with 
geometry and ideas which can be 
man.ipulated with fewer number 
values and strict calculations than 
other mathematical disciplines. 

"[Topology] is very close to the 
imagination," he said 

Freedman's ability to think in 
geometrical terms also earned him 
the National Medal of Science in 
1988 and a five-year "genius grant" 
from the MacArthur Foundation, 
according to Fortune. 

His interest in topology stemmed 
from his aversion to numbers in his 
high school mathematics courses. 

"I was not one that was absorbed 
by numbers," he said, adding that 
numbers often lead the student of 
mathematics away from the real is-
sues behind math. 

Michael Freedman 
dimensional surfaces, known in the 
discipline as manifolds. According 
to Fortune, topologists would see a 
doughnut and a coffee cup as the 
same object because they both have 
only one hole. 

Freedman's discovery has to do 
with the idea that three-dimensional 
manifolds are spheres, no matter 
how distorted they are if they satisfy 
certain tests. For many years, math-
ematicians could only prove this 
test for five dimensions or more, 
according to Fortune. 

Freedman is the first toprove the 
theory down to four-dimensional 
spheres, a major breakthrough in 
topology. His proof is 100 pages 
long, and reference work:; contrib-
uting to It stretch to about 1,000 
pages. 

proof. 
"Most of the aClual work is very 

solitary,"hesaid. "It involves weeks 
of thinking followed by a long-dis-
tance phone call to a colleague 
somewhere in the United States." 

According to Freedman, with-
out the help of his colleagues he 
would have needed more than seven 
years to complete the proof. 

"I particularly want to thank Bob 
Edwards at UCLA," he said. "His 
ideas and insights over the years 
were very helpful to the proof." 

Freedman believes undergradu-
ate students I 00 years from now 
may have to study his discovery in 
topology. 

"We're at a very fortunate time 
right now in rnadtand physics where 
we are laying the foundations that 
will always be used," he said. 

Just as the ancient Greeks set the 
groundwork for future students in 
geometry and math, scientists today 
are adding to the body ofknowledge 
that will be considered essential to 
future srudents, Freedman said. 

"'That's one of the fun things 
about being in the pure sciences," he 
said

favor that such an ordinance has 
a rational basis," the ruling con-
cluded. 

According to Wolfsheirner, 
the correct argument of the law 
states that "unrelated adults, who 
choose to live together, do not 
have fundamental status under 
the United States or California 
Constitutions. 

"Since they have no such fun-
damental right, government may 
control woes and dwelling types, 
in which they may choose to live, 
without demonstrating a com-
pelling interest," she said. 

'[The City of San Diego] 
needs to test the Anderson deci-

sion by enacting and enforcing a 
new ordinance that will both sol ve 
the problem and withstand judi-
cial scrutiny." Wol fsheimer con-
tinued. 

"[Cases lilce Anderson] rec-
ommend reslrictions on the 
number of people and vehicles 
per household as long as there is 
no discrimination against either 
the traditional or alternative 
'family.' 

"Uthe word ' family' is erased 
from the vocabulary of an ordi-
nance intended to preservesingle-
residence neighborhoods, that 
ordinance should pass constitu-
tional muster," Wolfsheimer 
wrote. 

ERRATUM 
In the story "Fourth Year of Drought Heightens UCSD 

Water Conservation Worries· (Guardian, Oct. 10), it was 
reported that UCSD campus irrigation takes place only 
between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. The story should have read 
"between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m."The Guardian regrets the error. 

In addition, offICials at Physical Plant Services wished to 
clarify that while non-recycling fountains will be shut down, 
the fountains in Revelle Plaza and the Price Center recycle 
their water and will not be affected.

COMMENTARIES 

A NITED 
ER ANY 

• A threat to western society 
or a golden age for Eu rope? 
By Greg Dixon, Associate Opinion Editor 

The Federal Republic of Gennany stands 
whole. The wrongs of nearly ~ half-century 
have been righted and the German question 

has finally been resolved. At the end of the 
Second World War, the Allies divided the 

Gennan state in two. Now, after 45 years of separation, the two 
have ~ one again. 

In the wake of this momentous occasion, there have been 
voices raised to deay this event as the beginning of a new era of 
destruction. 1bese voices wam of a Fourth Reich, a resurgence 
ofNaziisrn, and a Third World War. 

They also cry that Gennany will leave the West behind and 
form its own bJoclc with Eastern Europe. These, and adler fears, 
have been mentioned by iOOividuais who see danger in the 
reunification of Germany. 

Despite the appeal of these fears to some individuals, these 
fears are unrealistic and short sighted. The wood has nothing to 
fear from a united Germany, and a great deal to gain. 

For the ~ 40 years, West Germany has been an integral 
part of the wodd order. West Germany has demonstrated that it 
is a stable and reliable ally in Europe. West Germany has been a 
staunch supporter of the United States and its own westem allies 
time and again. 

West Germany has been a very productive member of the 
European Economic Cornnnnity (EEQ. 11K: WestGennars 

have dedicated themselves to the creation of a common 
European currency and a stable European monetary 

system. 
West Gennany has played a key ro\e -

along with Fraoce - in the formulation of 
the program to unify the European rnarl<et 
in 1992. Gennany shows no signs 
whatsoever of backing away from this 
program. 

West Germany has proven itself to be 
a nation dedicaled to democracy and the 

rule of law. Gennans vote in numbers which 
dwarfvotertumouts in the UnitedSwes. 
In addition, Germany has demonstrated that it has 

thrown off its past and is now looking to a furure of 
peaceful coexistence. Germany is a nation that realizes that 

its future lies with cooperation, and not conflict. What many 
forget is that the Gennans suffered more than any nation aside 
from the Soviet Union from WWIl in terms of mistrust, and the 
effects of social reorganization. The German people do not wish 
to pursue this course again. 

Somehave proposedthatanother Hitlercouldrisefrom the new 
Germany. This fear is unfounded. Hitler rose in a crushed Ger-

German Reunification Makes Some Parties Nervous 
• Country must remain 
separated to be reminded 
of its terrible past 
By Zachary Berman 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Most people look at the 
reunification of Germany as a 
joyful event. It symbolizes the fall 

of communism and the move toward 
world peace. Yet iI. this moment of 

optimism we should also look: at the other side . .. the 
side that has the Soviet Uni n, France, and world 
Jewry very nervous. 

The first problem deal with Germany 's past. 

1870, 1914, and 1939 all mark the beginnings of 
long, bloody wars stal1ed by the Germans. There is an 
inert fear involved with restori ng power to a nation 
that is responsible for three wars. Perhaps the people 
of Germany are in a peaceful country now, but what 
is to stop the same forces that drove their ancestors to 
war, from one day arising again? Would it be safe to 
assume that if the German people of today were born 
50 or 60 years ago. the events of the past would never 
have happened? Is there something in the culture or in 
the land it elf that dri ves the Gennan nation toward 
war when things get rough? 

When we tand 3,000 mile away from Germany it 
is easy for us to give a nod of approval towards 
reunification. None of us have felt the horror of 
having a war fought in our own back.yard. Some parts 

of Europe are still battle-scarred from war. Many bomb 
shelters still exist. It may seem ridiculous to us that 
France and the Soviets are scared of reunification , but we 
must remember they have lived through three wars fought 
in their own countries. To them, a fourth is not so 
unbelievable. 

The second issue concerns everyone, but most of all 
the Jews. It is terrifying to realize that the holocaust 
occurred only 45 years ago. Tragically, this is not a 
phenomenon isolated to the past. Right now, Israel is 
receiving 10 Lo 15 thousand immigrants a month. I can 
assure you this isn't because Israel is an appealing place 
to live. This is due to the pogroms and anti-semitism that 
are spreading throughout Eastem Europe. 

It may seem wrong to hold a generation responsible

ate peq>le hope. 

Modem Gennany is one of the

world In a wealthy nation there is far 
less chance of exploiting popular dis-
content and radically changing the 
political landscape. 

In addition Germany has a diverse 
system ofpo1itical parties whichcom-
pere for power. The odds ofone group 
defeating all othm is very unlikely, 
especially given the diverse political 
climare ofGennany. 

It is also important to recall that 
Gennany could have gone its own 
way, if it had chosen to. 

One of the plans for Germany's 
unification WlL'I for it torernain neutral 
and be a buffer between the Warsaw 
Pact and NATO. 

Gennany could have adopCed this 
program and left NATO and the west 
to foon its own block, but the Ger-
mans chose to stand by those who 
stood by thern. Germany stated that its 
future was with the West and that it 

would not abandon its allies, even at 
the cost of continued division. 

All told, Germany is now whole. It 
has begun to repair the damage of the 
past 45 years of division and is going 
ahead with its business. 

For the Gennans, uniticalion will 
not change their outlook towaros the

for its past, but to forget it is worse. 
Who should we hold responsible 
for the past? 

A divided Germany should not 
be looked at as a punishment, but 
more as a reminder. If the German 
people are so regretful of the past, 
and want to prevent it from ever 
occurring again, they should accept 
their division. This way it can stand 
as a symbol for all the world of an 
unwanted past. 

Reunification is a step towards 
erasing the past. Now what is left? 
Can we allow the attempted 
genocide or the wars of the past to 
be left to the pages of history? Acts 
such as these cannot be remem-
bered for 40 or 50 years and then be 
conveniently tucked away in the 
back of our minds or in a dusty 
book on a shelf. If this is done it is 
sure to repeat itself. Division is a 
powerful symbol, one that can stand 
to prevent the past from ever recur-
ring again. 

When I ask people what they 
think of the reunification of Ger-
many, I usually get a response such 

as, "They are different people 
now ... " It is as though the mere 
question of reunification calls for 
assurance that the crimes of the 
past will not happen again . There 
seems to be a cel1ain uneasiness 
with reunifying Germany. The kind 
of uneasiness that makes one 
wonder "could it happen again?" 
But this is also the kind of uneasi-
ness that can fade into the back-
groundofall the world'satrocities. 
The kind of problem that occurs 
only in the pages of text bo9ks, 
never in the real world. 

Now that Germany has been 
reunified we see the wiping away 
of a symbol. Not only a symbol of 
three wars, but of the killing of six 
million people. Germany should 
stand divided as a reminder of its 
past. Then, when a child asks his 
parents why it remains as such, 
they can say, "A reminder of a past 
that should never be repeated." And 
thus never forgotten.

Both McKay and Pasternak: 
warned that there has been talk 
among state legislators that if stu-
dents gi ve the impression that they 
caneasiJyaffordloaccepta$70per 
quarter fee increase fora recreationa/ 
facility , there may be less incentive 
to keep general student fees down. 

Edson, who vetoed an earlier 
version of the resolution after it was 
passed by the council on Oct. 1, 
asked counci1members to give him 
a chance to appear at the Academic 
Senate meeting in two weeks before 
passing such a resolution. 

Edson is concerned about pres-
sure from faculty members, who 
would like to see the $8 million the 
administration has promised toward 
RIMAC go to academic facilities 
instead. 

''The faculty is trying to inter-
vene in an unprecedented way," 
Edson noted. He said that in a worst-
case scenario, Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson could be pressured into 
withdrawing the $8 million com-
mitment and eliminating the events 
component of the facility. 

"Students may be asked to pay 
more for a smaller facility," Edson 
advised. "I can say that [the admin-

istration] is not going to Mickey 
Mouse around with the financial 
cornmitment-that$8 million isn' t 
going to stay there." 

Emotions ran high during the 
debate, as council members pre-
sented their views of various as-
pects of the RIMAe issue. 

Vice President Administrative 
Ruben Duran at one point stepped 
down from his impartial position as 
council chair to point out that what 
he tennedEdson 's "political game" 
maymean"we' reriskingRIMAC," 
if funding is pulled, or "risking very 
many students" who would not be 
able to afford a fee increase.

" Royal" 
Brothers 
Unite for 
Support 

Three years ago, The 
Royal Brotherhood of Ex-
cellence inspired afreshrnan 
named Darvin Jackson to 
Ufurther [his] wants to 
achieve more in college." 

This year. Jackson. as a 
senior, is the president of 
The Royal Brotherhood of 
Excellence (RBE), an orga-
nization serving as a suppon 
group for African-American 
males. 

Although membership is 
also open to females and 
students of otherethnicities, 
the group focuses on giving 
African-American males 
"some kind of center to go 
[tol and a type of network-
ing," said Jackson. 

"The club is a type of 
bond. A sister can give the 
same thing, but sometimes 
you just need to be away 
from the opposite sex, Fe-
males share some same ex-
periences; in the same es-
sence, males share some 
same experiences. If you 
have shared experiences, 
you can relate to what is 
going on. Since there are 
few African-Americans on 
campus. they can relate to 
each other. Then they can 
help each other," Jackson 
explained. 

The president claims that 
in "previous years. there 
weren't that many African-
American males on campus. 
They usually go to a lot of 
other UC schools if they 
even go to college. There 
are not many black males in 
college as a whole." 

To recruit future A frican-
American scholars to 
UCSD. RBE plans to have a 
Unity and Network: Orien-
tation on Nov. 3. to bring 
young African-American 
males on campus. 

" We focus on young 
males [from I the sevemh, 
eighth , and ninth grades 
because they have a chance 
of redirecting their lives as 
far a wanting to achieve 
more in life .... We bring 
them on campus and let them 
know that there are A frican-
American males in college 
striving to become what 
other people have achieved," 
said Jackson. 

He hopes that the youths 
will not want to "join a gaol

Associate Features Editor 

With over 250 tutors having 
assisted children in three 
different schools in such areas as 
reading, computers, and even 
tumbling, for the past two years, 
there's no doubt about Caroline 
AlJam's words, "A.S.K. is going 
strong." 

According to its flyer, 
A.S.K., or Active Students for 
Kids, "responds to ... challenges 
in the community." 

These "challenges" include 
the fact that, across America, 10 
percent of children have 
ilJiterate parents, and one in four 
students will drop out of school. 
Because of the present economy, 
both parents usuaHy work:. 
forcing children to face day-
care, or an empty house, after 
school. 

In response, "active" college 
students tutor local children 
once a week. 

"We are students helping 
students - as role models, as 
friends, as people," the flyer 
indicated. 

To date, A.S.K. is the largest 
on-going, student-run volunteer 
Morial program in the Univer-
sity of California and California 
State University Systems. 

Allam, often called the 
"founding mother" of A.S.K. , 
created the program in 1988 as 
chair of the Warren Apartment 
Government (W.A.G.) Commu-
nity Services Cornmittee, 

"We sent out surveys and 
many students wanted to be Big 
Brothers and Big Sisters but you 
had to be 2l. People wanted to 
volunteer with kids but were too 
young," she said. 

Allam explained that tutoring 
was the ideal way for students to 
get involved with kids. 

At first, Allam ran the 
program, which was initially 
named Warren College Tutorial 
Program, out of her Warren 
Apartment. But, "it just got so 
big," she said, 

Thus, Allam and her 
commitee moved A.S.K. to the 
Volunteer Connection of the 
Price Center last year " to 
centralize it," Allam explained, 
"so that it is open to students 
from all of the colleges." 

As a result of the move, the 
number of A.S.K. tutors grew 
"from 40 just from Warren to 
135 from all fi ve colleges," 
Allam said. 

Those who panicipate in 
A.S.K., which is in session 
Winter and Spring quaners, have 
several options in their tutoring 
mode: they may be involved 
with one-on-one tutorina. active 
assistance, enrichment pro-
grams, or spe 'ial projects.

Opportunities Knock at Volunteer Connection 
By Sangeeta Mehta 
Associate Features Ediitor 

Caroline Allam. director of the 
Volunteer Connection, named two 
reasons why volunteering is im-
ponant. 

"I) It's a way to get involved 
with the community, not only to be 
a part but [also] to have a role, to 
make a difference. 2) It can define 
career goals ... you talk to people 
who do what you want to do." 

Students who wish to lend a 
helping hand can obtain the infor-
mation they need at the Volunteer 
Connection. 

Started in 1986, the Volunteer 
Connection, located on the third 
floor of the Price Center, is a refer-
ral center to volunteer opportuni-
ties for students, faculty, and staff. 

"We act as the link," said Allam, 
"matching up people' s skills and 
talents to [volunteer programs and 
agencies]." 

Although the Volunteer Con-
nection started "at ground zero" as 
Allam said, it now has 250 agen-
cies on file. These agencies in-
clude animal centers, hospitals, 
boys' and girls' clubs, among oth-
ers. 

Allam explained that these vol-
unteer opportunities are organized 
according to issues. "We divide 
our binders in categories such as 
arts, recreation,legal agencies, the 
elderly, [and) the homeless." 

Elaine Kimura, director of 
Educational Resources, explained 

that when people come in for infor-
mation, they may look through the 
binders provided and fill out a re-
ferral sheet." 

Sue Parle, assistant director of 
the Volunteer Connection, is in 
charge of much of this referring. 

"The different colleges have 
their own [ volunteer] issues they 
deal with," explained Allam. "For 
example, Revelle has a public ser-
vice program, and Muir has a San 
Diego Center for Children. Sue di-
rects students to the different col-
leges' organizations." 

Parle also meets with represen-
tatives of campus organizations 
interested in volunteering to en-
courage student organizations to 
take on community service 
projects. 

Fifth College's volunteer pro-
gram, Community Outreach Effort 
(C.O.R.E.), is headed by Parle and 
Iulie Evertsen. 

"We're a group of about sixty 
and work with various types of 
groups in the community ,"Evertsen 
said. 

Evertsen mentioed that the 
group takes monthly trips to an 
orphanage in Tijuana, and in a few 
months will visit a teen shelter and 
an animal shelter. The group will 
also cook turkeys for Thanksgiv-
ing to be donated to the homeless. 

In the winter, Evertsen said that 
they will be "adopting an inner-
city junior high so that each mem-
ber of [our group) will have a stu-

dent." 
"We want to be big brothers, 

big sisters, role-models-mentors 
for the students. We also want to 
help them academically." she said. 

About C.O.R.E .• Evertsen said, 
"We hope to start a tradition at 
Fifth for years to come." 

Allam said that fraternities and 
sororities often want to dedicate 
their time to community service. " 

"Around Thanksgiving time 
they (or other people) may say, 
' we want to work in a kitchen.' So 
we find an agency and connect the 
two," she said. 

Yet many students volunteer as 
individuals. Sunil Bhopal and 
G1eM Waldman both volunteer at 
Scripps Memorial Hospital. 

Bhopal said. "They let you do 
menial stuff but they also let you 
learn a lot. You can watch what 
the doctor is doing on minor surgi-
cal procedures and sometimes 
question [them]. They're very re-
ceptive." 

Waldman explained one of his 
more memorable experiences vol-
unteering. "Once a patient came in 
and had an abnormal heart beat. 
They didn't think it was anything 
serious, but [it turned out that this 
case) was almost equivalent to a 
trauma case. and there was no 
trauma team. Someone had to 
document [what happened) so I 
did - what drugs were adminis-
tered. the times ..... 

Although students can seek 

outside volunteer opponunities at 
the Volunteer Connection, it does 
provide some of its own. 

Kimura handles a tutorial pro-
gram entitled A.S.K. in which stu-
dents work with San Diego school 
children in academic subjects as 
well as sports and arts. 

Besides the satisfaction of help-
ing others and the joy of working 
with children, Kimura mentioned 
other reasons why students join 
A.S.K.. "A lot just want to get 
away from [homework) and mid-
terms." 

She explained that sometimes 
tutors may be really upset about a 
'C' on a midterm. but when they 
are is tutoring. the poor grade is no 
longer a big deal to the tutors. 

Gaining experience in teaching 
teacher is another reason why stu-
dents tutor. according to Kimura. 

Kelly Fuchino. director of Spe-
cial and Community Relation for 
the Volunteer Connection. orga-
nizes one-day events each quarter. 

Fuchioo's current main project 
is an on-carnpus Special Olympics 
Sports-a-Thon. which will take 
place on Saturday, Oct 20 from 
8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Those in-
terested may chaperone. register,

A.S.K.: Students Give Time, Energy to Young 
Continued from page 7 
rector of educational resources and 
in charge of volunteer tutorial ser-
vices such as A.S.K .• explained 
her experiences in tutoring one 
child. 

"At first, we dido 't get along," 
she admitted. 

According to Kimura, her 
student's goals were limited in the 
beginning because all he wanted in 
life was to own a truck. But by the 
end of the school year, he had 
expanded his interests and asked 
Kimura to tutor him again. 

"Now we're really good friends. 
I know he grew, matured a lot," 
said Kimura, "and I think 1 did 
too." 

Chris Kim, who also tutored 
one-on-one, said. "There were two 
or three kids in the class who had 
problems [with English gram mer] 
so I gave them the indi vidual atten-
tion they needed." 

"We would go out to the lunch 
benches where it was more iso-
lated." he said, "and worked at the 
pace they needed. If they had spe-
cific questions, they couldjust ask 
me .tt 

Kim explained that teachers 
usually dido 't have the time to 
assist the students having trouble. 
"It was better that they could ask 
me instead of asking the teacher 
who would just say, 'I'll get back 
to you later.'" 

In active assistance, a student 
may act as a classroom aide, helping 
small groups of children in various 
subjects. 

Sarah Gabl was involved with 
active assistance tutoring junior 
high social studies. 

"{ talked about loan of Arc, a 
topic they were covering at that 
time." Gabl explained. 

''I'd take the kids outside and 
tell them about this l4-year-old 
girl talking to spirits '- it was fun 
for me. And I know they got more 
out of it [tutoring) than from read-
ing from textbooks." Gabl said. 

"Because I'm not quite at the 
level of the teacher - I'm more 
down to earth - I can take these 
kids who are targeted as drop-outs 
and motivate them," said Gahl, 
who also worked in a French lan-
guage class. said. "That's the pur-
pose ofthe program." 

Enrichment programs involve 
college students directing small 
groups in drama, music, art, sports, 
and computers; Allam hopes that 
dance will be added to this list. 
Tutors may design a school news-
letter. or present a "Say NO to 
drugs" program if they decide to 
work with special projects. 

Barbara Coates, the principal at 
Bay Park Elementary School where 
A.S.K. volunteers tutor, com-
mented on the drama production 
the tutors organized last year. "It 
was a fabulous play," she said. 

Coates explained that A.S.K. 
tutors had re-written the book 
Phantom Tollbooth into aplay, and 
spent 18 weeks with the children 
working on it. 

Coates spoke highly of the 
A.SK program itself. "The school 
is really thrilled by the program. 
Some tutors come during the day, 
helping in classrooms: some, after 
school. Others [work with stu-
dents on] art, or baseball, or in the 
computer lab." 

She added that each year Bay 
Park has a huge Halloween ar-
nival and many UCSD students 
come and help with the booths. 

"A lot of children don't have 

anyone in their lives who sees them 
as individual and special. [A.SK] 
really makes a difference." said 
Coates. 

.. [The students and tutors) form 
special friendships. Many of the 
tutors took the rstudenl~] outto ice 
cream. The kids [can have] a spe-
cial person in their lives also to 
assist themacadernically." she said. 

Raissa Marasigan, who has tu-
tored with A.S.K. for four quar-
ters. said, "I took [my student) to 
the movies once with some other 
tutors. It was fun. [The children 
aren't) used to going out." 

Coates emphasized again, "It's 
a terrific program." 

Kim agreed, "It's a great pro-
gram not just for the kids but for 
college students. too. After being 
surrounded by my peers all the 
time. it's nice to be surrounded by 
kids .. . and I really think [tutoring) 
makes a difference." 

Kimura atoibutes much of the 
uccessof A.S.K. toherstaffwhich 

she termed as "excellent ... " AS.K. 
wouldo't exist without this core 
grou p," she said, which includes 
Allam, Cheryl Haw. Lisa 
Mangiarelli, Maggie Murphy ,Lyra 
Ng, David Rinerband, Stacy Roth, 
and Dustin Skoboloff. 

But Kimura does plan to make 
some change in AS.K. She hopes 
to train the tutors more, hold one 
field trip a quarter (during which 
their tudentscantourUCSD),and 
urge tutors to become more in-
volved in the tUlees' school activi -
ties. 

But the big change, according 
to Allam, is that ASK will only 
send tutors to one school. Bay Park 
Elementary in Mission Bay. and 
will limit it number of tutors. 

"We have a quota. and after it is 
filled. there will be a wait list," said 
Allam. explaining that the quota 
will work on a first-comc. first-
serve basis right after telephone 
registration. 

"If Bay Park runs to the point 
that it's smooth, then we'll reorga-
nizeagainatBayview."saidAllam. 
She added. "We've gotten so much 
support from the faculty and staff 
at Challenger [Junior HighSchool] 
that we want to go back." 

The reason for this big change is 
because "we want it to be focused 
and make the program run effi-
ciently so that it continues. We 
owe it to the kids," said Kimura. 

Allam said that a goal of A .S.K. 
now is to be "a model program so 
that other students will be inspired 
to form their own A.S.K. pro-
grams." 

"It only takes one person to cre-
ate something," said Allam. 

Yet the underlying goals of 
A.S.K. remain the same. 

"We want tutors to be role-
models. mentors; we want to show 
them what college is like [because 
somedon 't want to go to college]," 
Kimura said. 

Although not as many students 
will be able to tutor now through 
A.S.K., Allam emphasized that they 
will make "every effort to place 
everyone and anyone who wants to 
work [in education)." 

John Dean will start tutoring 
next quarter. He said. "I'm really 
looking forward to it. Jjust want to 
help people ... it's a good thing." 

"It's so rewarding to have a 
teacher say. ' Oh thank you for 
sending me Karen and Josh, .. • said 
Allam. "It·s so good to know we're 
a link to the community." 

Fuchino said, "People pledge 
maybe five cents apoint [scored in 
the events]." 

Another one-day project 
Fuchino plans later in the quarter 
is .. Angeltree." 

"At Round Table there will be 
a tree with ornaments and a wish 
list [on which] kids say what they 
want. [People] can take off an or-
nament and buy [what the child 
wants)."

"We staned out as D.J.'s," Deadrick ex-

wesaw this band that was really terrible. Jokingly

"When I listen to music, I like something that 
I can dance to, but not only that, it's gona be 
something that will wear me out after three songs.

Coupled with Henthorn 's music are Deadrick's

"All the club owners are getting sick of hearing

have yet to solicit ourselves to get a gig. Every-
where we've played we've been asked to play." 

"Just watch," Deadrick retoned, "in a year the

I stole my sister's boyfriend. It 
was all a whirlwind. heatandflash. 
Within a week we killed my parents 
and hit the road. 

This can be read from the cover 
of Sonic Youth's new release Goo. 
What has it got to do with the 
album itself? Nothing really, except 
for the fact that it is something that 
is as contrary to the average ex pec. 
tations of society as you can get. 
That seems to be what Sonic Youth 
is all about. Their new album is a 
little shocking and a liule rebel· 
lious, and the group makes no 
apologies about it. 

Sonic Youth's sound is basically 
a strong rhythm supponed by hard 
distortion guitars that give the al· 
bum an almost psychedelic sound. 
About halfofthe songs are sung by 
a male voice and the rest are female, 
including the hot single from the 
album, "Cool Thing." No matter 
who sings, the songs are all intense 
and raucou£. This is not a band that 

EVIEWS 
you can count on for good roman-
tic songs. Rather, if you want to 
get a liule pumped up, this album 
will get your adrenaline flowing. 

Aside from "Cool Thing," other 
good songs include "Diny Boots" 
and "Disappearer." Sonic Youth is 
one of many bands bursting upon 
the scene, along with Jane's Ad-
diction and Social Distonion, that 
combine an intense sound with 
strong· spoken, thought provoking 
lyrics. This is a band that definitely 
has something to say, and they say 
it the way that they want. .AJthough 
a little too heavy to receive much 
radio air time, especially on the 
Top 40 stations afraid to play any-
thing different, Goo has much to 
offer for the music fan who wants 
a sound that will shake things up a 
little bit.

The UCSD Guardian 

Mould tries but can't quite get it 
right. Together with ex·bandmate 
Grant Han and Greg Norton, the 
grungy trio make some of the most 
passionate and intense garage rock 
ever. 

Mould's first solo work,1989' 
Workbook, was a meticulously· 
crafted LP that dealt with thedisin· 
tegration of Hiisker Oli, but lacked 
the passion. In Mould's new work, 
B/ack Sheels of Rain, he tries to 
change things up by blanketi ng the 
entire album in a wall of sonic 
guitars. The anger and self·pity of 
Mould's writing comes through 
loud and clear, though this time it's 
more annoying than appealing. 

There is one genuinely terrific 
song on Black Sheels, "It's Too 
Late." In this song, Mould cuts 
down on the thrash, kicks up a 
lighter, more enjoyable melody, 
and broods about the end of the 
world instead of himself. From here 
the album falls into a pattern, 
throbbing, wailing, and finally 
numbing guitars. 

Mould incessantly cries for an 
end to the pain of relationships. On 
"Out of Your Life" he sings, "If 
you want me out of your life now 
all you gotta do is tell me / I ain' t 
got a life of my own and the one I 
got with you could kill me." On 
"The Last Night" Mould declares, 
"There'll be no more excuses like 
I wasn't near a phone / You 
wouldn't call me even if you 
could." And on "Sacrifice - Let 
'There Be Peace" there is more of 
the same. "If} ride the rails I shall 
ride them alone / and ifI need all 
this pain I will find it alone."

HIATUS 3 

A Celebration of Cultural Diversity 
by Simon Hobbs 
Guardian Reporter 

Faith Ringgold has what she 
terms as "happy memories" of 
her childhood experience in 
1930' Harlem . These 
"memories" intermixed with 
parental influence, 1960s Af-
rican art , matriarchal 
storytelling, and cultural 
awareness combine to form Tar 
Beach #2 , a painted quilt, which 
is shown with other samples of 
her work at the Grove Gallery. 

Tar Beach #2 is, as the title 
may suggest, Ringgold's sec-
ond visualization of a warm 
dreamlike memory of her 
youth. The story is outlined to 
the observer in both written 
and painted forms and, not un· 
like a piece of literature, has a 
beginning, middle, and end. 
The characters are real and 
drawn from childhood remi· 
niscences and are consequently 
transferred to us through an 
imaginative medium. 

In the book, FairhRinggold, 
A 25 Year Survey, the anist 
explains the influences that led 
her to express herself in this 
specific way. 

In the 1960's she was in· 
spired by a combination of 
Indian and African an, espe· 
cially by the Kuban Africans 
who painted on cloth a means 
of recording and displaying 
cultural history. Ringgold also 
wanted to escape from the mu· 

seum an of the 1960s which 
she considers as. "pan of dead 
an and from dead times too." 

In 1967 the anist gave her 
first exhibition, showing the 
world the individual expression 
of her experiences. She "wanted 
people to feel like they were 
looking at themselves." When 
considering Tar Beach #2 
however, one wonders whether 
her message is truly univer· 
sally understandable or whether 
it is private and exclusive to 
those of a similar cultural up-
bringing. 

Alongside the quilt in the 
Grove Gallery are a sample of 
Ringgold 's dollmaking skills, 
the "people coming out of my 
painting." They show cultural 
diversity through dress and ex· 
pression, and add to what 
Ringgold calls her 
"superrealism." The dolls are, 
however, overshadowed by the 
vitality and optimism of Tar 
Beach #2 and fail to tell the 
casual observer a great deal. 

Faith Ringgold is continuo 
ing a cultural tradition of pass· 
ing information about black 
experiences, and it is a shame 
that there is not an opportunity 
to see a great deal more of her 
work at the Grove Gallery. 

If her images seem a little 
blatant and bland, the vitality 
and history of her underlying 
message make the work inter· 
esting and wonh a visit.

'Henry & June'-
A Write-Off 

Hugo. Although the character of 
Hugo was completely unrealistic, 
I couldn ' t putthe entire blame upon

crous and distorted manner. Guiler, 
who earned enough money as a

By Amy Knoke 
Staff Writer 

The executives at Universal 
Studios are probably secretly 
toasting the two idiots in a Boston 
suburb who banned "Henry & 
lune" from theaters without hav-
ing seen it. Had the two city offi-
cials seen the film, they might have 
realized that the supposed eroticism 
of Philip Kaufman's latest effort is 
at its best boring and at its worst 
hilariously unbelievable. 

It's depressing enough that this 
film will gross more than it should 
because it i the debut film of the 
alluring NC· 17 rating, designating 
certain films for adults only; what 
is worse is that people are once 
again taking it upon themselves to 
decide which films adults hould 
be allowed to see. 

Wake up Dedham, Massachu-
setts: by banning "Henry & June," 
you've probably increased ticket 
sales and besides, any episode of 
"Twin Peaks" i more titillating 
than Kaufman 's attempt at ensu-
aliry in the lives of authors Henry 
Miller and Anais Nin. 

Director Philip Kaufman , 
whose past works include "The 
Right Stuff' and " The Unbearable 
Lightnes of Being," is unable to 
provide any legitimacy to the char· 
acters in "Henry & June." The 
screenplay was adopted by 
Kaufman from Anais Nin 's 1986 
book Henry & June, an autobio· 
graphical work that finally exposed 
the facts of the tremulous sexual 
affairs that entangled renowned 
American author Miller, French· 
born Nin, and Miller's exception· 
ally beautiful wife June Miller, in 
1931-32 Paris. 

With this sort of background 
the film sounded great, but by the 
middle part of the movie I had 
grown restless with the one di-
mensional complacency of 
Henry (Fred Ward) and Anais Nin 
(Maria De Medeiros). The factthat 
other people were walking out of 
the special screening was probably 

another indication that this film 
was lacking in significant interest.

before. Dumb scene. 

What's worse is that the 
Kaufmans couldn't stop with one 
senseless sex scene; they had to 
put in two, and poor Hugo had to 
be in both. This particular scene 
was supposed to represent the un-
known limit of Nin's self-indul-
gent sexual exploration. The script 
had her walking through a street 
parade made up of magicians, 
musicians, and dancers wearing 
almost nothing more than blue body 
paint and full facial masks. As Nin 
made her way down the street, one 
of the dancers followed her to a 
more secluded area. 

There the dancer proceeded to 
attack her in the street and after a 
few minutes of struggle, Nin be· 
gan to have sex with hm. Nin par-
ticipated in the act, not knowing 
who the person was until the per-

to explore the edges of sexual and 
personal freedom, it only did so in 
aside show carnival way: you stand 
transfixed upon the bearded lady, 
but the whole time you're thinking 
to yourself, "Yeah, right." The 
Kaufmans wanted the characters 
to possess identities of their own, 
but managed to breathe life into 
only one, the apartment mate of 
Henry, known only as Osborn. 
Osborn (Kevin Spacy) took con-
trol of the very short three or four 
scenes that he appeared in and even 
though the character of Osborn 
was paranoid and also quite bi-
zarre, Spacy managed to convey a 
message to the audience: "Notice 
me, I am real." 

"Henry & June" attempted to 
reveal in an engrossing manner the 
sexual and mental ties that existed 
between two literary legends and 
their spouses. Although the film 
failed at producing 'believable, en-
gaging characters, one good thing 
came out of it: it seems as though I

Swamp Zombies 
Scratch and Sniff Csr Cra'" 
Dr, Dream Records 

SCREEEEEEEECH!! Brakes 
squeal. Cars collide. Bits of glass 
and metal fly allover the road. 

The experience of listening to 
the Swamp Zombies' third release 
on Dr. Dream Records is some-
thing like that. The album, entitled 
Scratch and Sniff Car Crash, brings 
listening to music into a new realm: 
the initial pressings of the album 
featured an actual car·crash· 
scented sticker. Although the 
sticker attracts attention to the al-
bum, it is in no way the only exciting 
aspect of the LP. 

Starting off fast and furious, the 
Swamp Zombies attack almost 
everything that can be humorous 
in some way, shape or form. With 
song titles such as "Rodentia," 
"Creeps," "Misfit Man" and 
"Speed Racer," these four guys 
might just displace the Dead 
Milkmen as America', premier 
humor band. But unlike their 
Philadelphia· based counterparts, 
the Swamp Zombies classify 
themselves as something more than 
just a punk rock band. One could 
venture to label them post-punk-
modern -alternative-folk-rock 
band. 

Scratch and Sniff Car Crash 
proves their superior talents by 
combining a wide range of instru-
ments into each song. From the 
banjo in the song "High Road" to 
the double bass in "Happy," all 
four band members show their 
musical versatility throughout the 
album. Josh Agle and Steve lacobs 
share the lead vocal duties while 
David Warren puts forth a lot of 
enelgy on the drums. Travis Agle 
adds the folksy sounds of slide 
guitar and harmonica. 

The only thing this album lacks 
is one song that really stands out. 
All of the album's cuts exude an 
energy that is very contagious and 
refreshing - just enough to let 
you forget about the awful smell of 
burning rubber and ozone that is 
settling around your stereo.

Friday and Saturday, rightl?! 

"I'm recording my first of four 
albums on CBS Records and the 
album's gonna be called T~ Fu· 
ture 0/ America. And the reason 
that I'm choosing San Diego is 
because I dig San Diego's style 
and I've been down at the Comedy 
Store a long time ... 

"1be important thing is to get 
the college kids down to the room, 
you know, and rock. it out, you 
know. 

"A lot of people have seen the 
show and a lot of people know who 
I am, if you just mention, you know,

3:00-4:30, Monday thru Fridays, 
and it's on also Saturday mornings

October 26 and 27." 
Pauly Shore on how be &CIt bis 

showonMTV: 
"Doing stand-up. You know, 

I've been doing stand· up for a 
while. I've guest veejayed a lot on 
MTV this last year. They offered 
me a show in the summer and then 
it continued on. It did well. I also 
recently hosted the new 'MTV Half 
Hour Comedy Hour.' So that will 
air next month too. And I've been 
touring around the colleges and 
stuff. Selling out and stuff."

came there to get away from. You 
know, and then when 1 open, you

'00 you guys like to party?' Then 
I go into some party stuff, you

" 'What's it gonna be like in like 30 years

- Pauly Shore, MTV vee-Jay 

Pauly Shore on what his show's 
about and where it's fUmed: 

"I shoot it allover America. I 
have on my show a contest. I go, 
'Write in ten reasons why you

Pauly Shore on his subject mat-
ter: 

"The stuff that I talk about is 
very college oriented. You know, 
I talk about what it's like, you 
know, in college. And what you 
do in college. I talk about back-
packing around Europe and I talk 
about rubbers, and masturbation, 
and stufflike that. Stuff, you know, 
we deal with." 
Pauly Shore OIl teIIiog a joke: 

"I say that I'm the future of 
America, that's the name of the 
album, and 1 say, 'What's it gonna 
be like in like 30 years from now?' 
You know, it will be like sure, you 
could take your drivers test in 
Spanish, Eoglish, or dude. And 
the guy's like, 'Well, I'll take it in

will be 'DUDES PARTYING.''' 
Pauly Shore on the "dude"-

ALBUMS 
ContInued from page H4 
Rhythms is the name of the album. 
and it is a strong indication of what 
you'll hear when listening to it. 
Band members Glenn Mercer and 
Bill Million have put together an 
album of songs featuring such 
rhythmical devices as sandpaper, 
pipes, cans, coat racks, and shoes 
- not to mention a variety of 
drums. Throw in a wide range of 
guitars and a punkish·style voice 
and the finished result is quite a 
unique sound. 

The rhythms used in the album 
range from upbeat punk to blues to 
funky Latin American maraca, 
ofien in one song. Guitar use, while 
including electric and treated gui· 
tars, is primarily limited to acous· 
tic, rhythm, and bass guitar. Al-
though the guitar playing is excel-
lent, it does tend to get a little 
repetitive. The album's uniqueness 
lies in the style of the drum beats 
and the slightly erratic voice of 
Glenn Mercer, which falls between 
melodic and shouting punk vocals. 

Songs featured on Crazy 
Rhythms includes a remake of the 
Beatles song "Everybody's Got 
Something to Hide (Except Me 
and My Monkey)" and of the 
Rolling Stones classic "Paint [t 
Black." Neither is as good as the 
original. The Feelies are a truly 
unique band, but it is doubtful that 
they will be propelled to 
superstardom by Crazy Rhythms. 
While this album may not be des-
tined to be called a "classic," its 
just right for something a little 
different.

• This Week's Don't Miss 
Event: Men's Soccer vs. 
Westminster College (UT) 

One week ago, UCSD men ' s soccer 
Head Coacb Derek Armstrong stated 
that the Tritons' season was riding on the 
ensuing seven days, and subsequent four 
games. 

One week lat.er, UCSD has gone 3-0 
against fellow west region playoff con-
tender CSU San Bernardino, powerful 
CSU Stanislaus, and Division n Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

The critical week comes to an end 
today as the Tritons face off against 
NAJA Westminster College, which beat 
Division III Colorado College 3-2. 

Colorado is currently the second-
ranked team in the west region - right 
behind the top-ranked Tritons, who are 
also ranked sixth in the nation. 

I A win would all but guarantee the Tritons an eightb consecutive trip to the 
western regional playoffs, and an op-
portunity to recaptu re tbe national 
championship they won in 1988.

I Year's Worth of Goals 
• McManus livid after 4-1 loss; women's soccer yields 
four goals in a game for first time since October 18, 1987 
By Robb Earnest 
Guardian Reporter 

Wednesday's women ' s soccer match 
between UCSD and the Cal Poly Pomona 
Broncos (6-6) djdn ' t start the way the Tri-
tons have become acc ustomed to in their last 
six matches. 

Heading into this matchup, UCSD had 
won six straight. the last three being 1-0 
wins over non-Division ill schools. 

From the opening minutes of this contest, 
however, it was apparent that the winning 
streak would be threatened. 

Just a mlDute and a half into the game, 
Bronco forward Shannon Payne, who had 
two goals and two assists on the afternoon, 
received the ball just outside the penalty 
box, turned, and lofted a shot over the out-
stretched arms of Triton goalkeeper Karin 
Carper. 

Payne' s goal broke a string of five con-
secutive shutouts by Carper and the Triton 
defense - but the worst was yet to come. 

"I kept telling them coming into this 
game that this would be a tough and physical

Tritons 
Shoot by 
Broncos 
• Men's soccer rocks 
Pomona with 20 first-half 
shots en route to 3-1 win 
By Robb Earnest 
Guardian Reporter 

Going into Wednesday's match against 
Division II Cal Poly Pomona (6-6), the UCSD 
men' s soccer team was confident - even 
cocky - that it was going to win. 

"We though we were going to steamroll 
them, but it turned out to be a bit tougher 
than we expected," UCSD Head Coach 
Derek Armstrong said. 

Indeed, this 3-1 victory for UCSD was 
anything but easy. 

The host Tritons (11-2-1) appeared to 
dominate the contest from the start , 
oulShooting the Broncos 20-2. They found 
themselves down early, however, when a 
Bronco midfielder rocketed a shot on a free 
kick from about 24 yards out. 

The shot just cleared the Triton wall, 
barely hitting inside the far post, and banked 
in past the reach of a sprawling Brian 
Siljandel\- who has yielded as many goals 
(three) in thelasttwo games as in the past 12. 

Cal Poly made that goal stand up until the 
half, leading 1-0 at the break. 

"You could really telllhllt we were a little 
overconfident when, in the locker room. we 
weren't really getting mentally prepared for 
the game," senior defender Sean West said. 
"We should have put them away in the first 
20 minutes, because they were playing flat. 

Armstrong noted that, "We've been 
playing good soccer, and it seemed like 
some of the players thought that would 
continue without them doing anything." 

If the first halfwas one of missed chances, 
the Tritons more than made up for it in the

with a thud in losing 4- 1 to Cal Poly Pomona on Wednesday. 

w. SOCCER 
Continued from page 9 
match," Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. 

"Cal Poly is always a strong, 
fast team." 

Indeed, the Tritons (8-2-1)came 
out flat, and never looked like they 
were really in the contest. 

After two goals within two 
minutes at 22:44 in the first half, 
the Tritons suddenly found them-
selves in a deep, deep hole. 

Coming into the contest, UCSD 
had allowed only two goals in 10 
games. 

Suddenly, the Tritons found 
themselves facing a deficit larger 
than a season's worth of goals. 

McManus was so incensed with 
the play of his team that he decided 
it was time to yank some of his 
starters and have a linle sitdown 
chat with them. 

"They were playing like little 
girls, just kicking the ball around, 
not making good passes and [not] 
controlling the ball," an irate 
McManus noted. 

"[Cal Poly] completely out-
played us. 

"The way we played today, 
we'll be lucky to win another match 
all year," he said. 

By the time the Divsion II 
Broncos had put in their fourth 
goal with just ten minutes re-
maining, the Tritons were looking 
at their worst defeat since a 4-0 
loss at Cal on October 18, 1987 -
a span covering 61 matches and 

nearly three years . 
There were a few bright spots in 

the otherwise dismal outing for 
UCSD,notablywhenjuniorKarin 
Lindsay broke the shutout with 
just under six minutes left in the 
game. 

It was her - and the team' s -
fourth goal in four games, and 
Lindsay's team-leading sixth 
o'/erall. 

Said McManus of the sole Tri-
ton tally, "It was pretty much a 
defensive lapse, with so little time 
remaining in the game, but Karin 
deserved the goal simply because 
she busted her ass all day. " 

According to McManus, other 
standout players were junior 
midfielder KaIyn Shea, junior 
sweeper Amy Wayte, and junior 
keeper Carper, who had a season-
high 10 saves - mostly because 
Cal Poly presented the most of-
fense of any opponent so far. 

Carper' s goals against per game 
ave.rage nearly tripled, jumping 
fromO.20toO.55inthespaceof90 
minutes. 

In fact, the intensity and team 
effort which had characterized the 
defending national champs for al-
most two years simply seemed to 
be missing. 

Added McManus, "If we don't 
raise our intensity level 110 per-
cent, we could be looking at an-
other defeat like this one against 
Westmont." 

NAlA Westmont is theTritons' 
next opponent, and McManus 
claims that it will be a difficult 
game.

Junior Jay Hagan and the Tritons shot past 13th-ranked Cal State Los Angeles Wednesday night.

Continued from page 9 

In the last 17 seconds of the first 
quarter, UCSD tied the game faster 
than the Eagles had run up a 2-0 
lead. 

Sophomore Kevin Vance nailed 
one from the hole position, cutting 
the deficit to 2-1 . Later, Dan Keller 
took advantage of a six-on-five 
opportunity, finding the net at the 
buzzer to bring the score to two all. 

This brief taste of scoring was 
not enough for the Tritons, as 
UCSD retained its momentum 
throughout the second quarter. 

Vance and Aaron Armstrong 
combined for two goals, and Keller 
added his second and third of the 
night for the Tritons. 

UCSD's defense kicked in as 
an important factor in the second 
stanza - with several key saves 
by freshman goalie Andy Bruce, 
who had a total of nine - and a 
crucial steal by sophomore Mike 
Bennett.

second half . 

They once more dominated the 
ball, winning more loose balls than 
the Broncos. This time, however, 
the Tritons turned the shots into 
goals. 

On a long throw-in from 
sophomore forward Chris Romey, 
defender Mike Gerhardt got his 
head on the ball and netted it for 
his team-leading eighth goal of 
the season. 

The Tritons took the lead soon 
afterthat when Gerhardt hit a cross 
that was trapped by sophomore 
midfielder ]arret Stevenson. 

The Broncos' defense thought 
that they had Stevenson off-sides, 
but there was no call. 

Stevenson was left alone to hit 
a shot off the outside of his foot, 
which angled past the Broncos' 
diving goalkeeper. 

West finished off the scoring 
with a penalty kick - his second 
in two games. 

The Tritons allowed only one 
Eagle goal in the second quarter, 
ending the first half with an im-
pressive 6-3 lead. 

Following a Gary Seelhorst goal 
two minutes into the second half 
that put UCSD up by four, the tide 
turned in favor of CSULA. 

It was an important test for the 
Tritons, who relinquished a twa-
goal lead in a loss to Long Beach 
State in UCSD's previous game. 

The Golden Eagles' surge was 
not halted until halfway into the 
fourth period, as their four-goal 
rampage knotted the score at seven 
apiece, turning the Tritons' lead 
into a distant memory. 

But who needs history when 
freshmen such as Sean Kinghorn 
are able to come off the bench and 
capitalize on a man-up opportunity 
to put UCSD on top once again? 

Kinghorn, an example of the 
promise of this young team, added 
an insurance goal with a minute 
left in the game, extending the 
Tritons' lead to a necessary two. 

The Golden Eagles, with a last 

gasp of hope, brought the score to 
a final 9-8 with a last-minute goal, 
but were victims of the clock in 
seeing their record drop to 9-9. 

The Tritons' record, with two 
wins in three outings, now stands 
at 4-17, but Head Coach Denny 
Harper feels it doesn't exemplify 
the team's true ability. 

"[The players] are victims of 
one of the toughest intercollegiate 
schedules of any of the UCSD 
teams," Harper commented. 

"We have not lost a single game 
to a team ranked lower than us." 

The poor reputation of this 
year's sq uad, after last season' s 
history-maker, is undeserved, ac-
cording to Harper, who said, "TIle 
last few weeks have been hard. 
They've been dealt with an unfair 
hand.TIley'renot bad,they'rejust 
young." 

TIle competition for the Tritons 
in the Open Division is mostly 
versus Division I and 11 teams, but 
by upsetting fellow Western Wa-
ter Polo Association contender 
CSULA, their hopes remain high.

A preview of this weekend's UCSD sporting events: 
• IIIN·. AND WOMIN·. CROSS COUNIRY: 
UCSD at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Saturday, 8:30 a.m. 

In the teams' next-ta-Iast meet of the regular season, Head 
Coach Mark: Stanforth is looking for two things to happen. He 
wants member& of both teams to make breakthroughs in their times 
and placings - especially the men who are bunched together as 
middJe-of-the-pack runners. In doing that, the people who will fill 
each team's seven regional spots will be decided. 

• WOM ... •• SOCCIII: Westmont at UCSD, Friday, 3 p.m. 
After getting rocked in their worst loss in three years Wednesday, 

the Tritons will attempt to make a quick turnaround in just two 
days. This shouldn't be a problem for the defending national 
champions, who are currently ranked second in the nation with an 
8-2-1 record. 

Two years ago, UCSDdowned Westmont at home by a sizeable 
4-1 margin. 

• WOMIN·. VOLLEYIIALL: 
Occidental at UCSD, Saturday, 7 p.m. 

The UCSD Guardian Friday, October 12, 1996 

Last year the Tritons rode a roller coaster throughout the season 
because of the way they played. This year they're doing the same 
as their schedule takes them from an easy match to a hard one and 
back again. 

Rima UzglrlsiGuardiaii 
Heather Holtzclaw and the Tritons dinked, spiked, and blocked their way to a four-game victory. 

Coming off a four-game win over white-hot Point Lorna 
Nazarene, UCSD should have little trouble with the Tigers, whom 
they blitzed 15-2, 15-6 at the Claremont/Pomona-Pitzer Invita-
tional earlier this season. 

• _N·. WA .... POLO: 
UCSD at UC Irvine, Friday, 7 p.m. 

Both of these teams participated in the national championship 
tournament last season. UCSD was the highest ranked non-
Division I school, and UCI emerged the wmner. 

Likewise, both teams are not enjoying the most successful of 
seasons, as the Tritons are 4-17, including Wednesday's edging of 
Cal State Los Angeles. 

CSULA defeated the defending champion Anteaters recently, 
which translates to a ~trong chance of a Triton victory by way of 
the transitive property of common opponents.

The first game saw the Tritons 
spot the Crusaders a 3-0 lead be-
fore roaring back by outscoring 
Point Lorna with a 10-2 run en 
route to a 15-7 win. 

Crusader mistakes and service 
rrrors aided UCSD's cause. 

Game two was hard-fought, as 
Point Lorna overcame an early 6-0

deficit before bowing 15-9 to the 
Tritons. Scrappy play by the Cru-
saders and poor execution by 
UCSD tightened the game until 
the Tritons emerged from their funk 
by scoring six points in a row to 
fend off Point Lorna. 

The toughest game of the match, 
however, came next, as the Tritons 
blew a 6-2 lead and allowed the 
Crusaders to outscore them 12-4, 
to take a 14-10 lead. The Tritons 
rallied to knot up the game at 14, 
but eventually lost 16-14. 

"We made some bonehead mis-
takes with our errors in serve and 
by hitting the ball into the net," 

Dannevik said. 
The fourth game saw UCSD 

put away a stubborn and pesky 
Point Lorna squad 15-11 as the 
Crusaders, down 14-6, fought off 
two match points and crept to 
within three points at 14-11. 

Overall, Dannevik was pleased 
with the team's effort against the 
red-hot Crusaders. 

With continued improvement 
and consistency, the Tri tons' quest 
for a sixth national championship 
may not be out of reach, something 
no one could have predicted for a 
team that lost eight players from 
last season's squad.

This looks to be the toughest AM 

season in UCSD history. There are six to 
seven very good teams who could win the 
coveted Animal Bow! championship. No 
team looks to be overly dominant, yet all 
teams could win the championship. 

This also will be known as the year of 
the funky-no block·spread offense. Talk 
about being trendy, last year the Fogcutters 
won the championship with the spread 
offense. So what happens now? Almost 
every team is using that quiche offense. 
No mowing them down like in years past.

offense. My goodnessl

former top caliber play. With the adOtion 
of top new recruit Malick White and the

Last year's Cha~ Captain Fogcutters

Criswell Set to Defend Two-Man VB Championships 
The 1990 Two Man Indoor Volleyball Championships kick off the UCSD Intramural Special Events calendar 

tomorrow morning and you can be sure a guy named Scott Criswell will be there. 
Why? Cuz, he always is! That's just the nature of the Scott Criswell beast. Not only will he be there ... you'd 

better make book nowl He should win this baby! Again! For the 70th straight year. 
I mean that may sound harsh and all that, but reality is reality. And dominance is dominance, and Scott Criswell 

is one dominant dude when it comes to indoor two-man volleyball. 
We'll recap it briefly for you. When Scott was an undergrad he won this tournament at least four straight times, 

many times with different partners. Then he becanne the assistant Men's Volleyball coach at UCSD and that 
allowed him to enter and playa few thousand more times. We can't really remember how many, but we think he 
won them all. With different partners. 

Now comes 1990 ... a new decade and guess what! He looks vulnerable this time around. Older, slower, 
heavier! But then, there's the matter of his partner. Yep ... you guessed it! None other than Nate Brown. Yah ... that 
Scott knows how to pick 'eml 

It should be curtains for the 14 other Men's Open teams, but let's just play it out and see what happens. The 
Spencer Boys ... OIson and Menlove and the team of Chad Hinkle-Matt Adams all think they can do some damage. 
And with a couple of sub-machine guns apiece they might be right. 

The Men's Open Division starts at 8:00am sharp Saturday morning wijh the Men's Intermediate to follow around 
11 :1 Sam. 
Tournament Director TIm Rapp will be orchestrating the affair from courtside in the Main Gymnasium and has 
rounded up a tremendous batch of prizes courtesy of the championships' two major sponsors: Volleyworid (in 
Mission Beach) .. .for great volleyball attirelfashionsland equipment and The Chart House restaurant of La Jolla
