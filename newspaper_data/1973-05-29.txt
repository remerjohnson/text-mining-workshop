Waldie Speaks at USD 
8 .... Hlelea 

In a discussion with a small gathering at USD last Friday Jerome Waldie, candidate for 
Governor of California, expressed his views on such critical issues as financial 
corruption in politics, environmental problems, and racial integration. " 

The Congressman called for a new attitudeJn government, similar to that of the Pat 
Brown administration. He stated that..he could not "think of ~ single program" of the 
Reagan administration which has tended to "help people in California who are 
disadvantaged or powerless". The Brown administration, on the other hand, was 
concerned with helping thore who were disadvantaged, imprisoned, and mentally ill. 

Waldie stated that he would "be running a populi"st campaign", attempting to e'nlist 
"broad and widespread support" among the people. A similarity has been noted 
between his campaign thus far and the McGovern predidential campaign last year. As 
was the case with McGovern he lacks the financial resources that other candidates 
are able to draw upon. His campaign relies largely on the activities of unpaid volunteers, 
rather than large expenditures of campaign money. He professes concern for the 
voiceless and powerless. 

The San Diego Union quoted him as stating (in remarks on the Office of Economic 
Opportunity) that ~My own view is that OEO did not fail... and it was not curtailed 
because it was a failure. It was curtailed because ... it was a success." 

Waldie expressed his sentiments on a number of specific issues. He expressed 
Concern for the preservation of the invironment. He said that mountains, deserts, etc. 
need to be protected by a state program such as that which was initiated in connection 
with the coastline. He stated that he is not persuaded that we are faced with an energy 
crisis of the proportions which some have described. He said that "every suggestion to 
alleviate the crisis in energy has _as_its focal point" opposition to a conservation 
movement (e.g. the Alaska pipelinel-He stated that energy industries' wants are being 
sought by utilizing the argument that there is an energy crisis; he said that the oil 
depletion allowance is defended in these terms. 

As far as education is concerned, Waldie stated that it should not be so dependent on 
property tax, because people will vote down property tax, and education suffers. He 
stated that he favors busing if it is the only method to achieve the "terribly important" 
objective of an integrated society. 

In connection with financial corruption In politics, Waldie stated that the electorate 
should demand full disclosure of candidates' sources of money for campaign activities. 
He said that a thread which runs throughout the Watergate affair is the gigantic sums of 

~oney which were contributed without disclosure, money which, it is now being 
discovered, was used for financing activities such as the Watergate break-in. He said 
that there is an "equal tendency toward corruption in this state.". He stated that a 
politician's sources of money reveal to what "extent the integrity of the candidate has 
b e n compromised". 

~aldie expressed support for the d criminalization of the us of marijuana. He 
VOiced opposition to the death penalty, which , he said, he has oppos d for a great 
many y~ars. As far as Reagan's tax program i concerned, he expres ed oppOSition to it. 

Waldie stated that he favors the Equal Rights Amendment . He said that he changed 
~an~ of his own attitudes to women when he realized how destructive th y were. A ~~nallssu which he discussed is theTtat of m dical care in California. H aid that the 
I syst m is abysmal", but that any mas ive change will have to come from the f dral 
ev I. Everybody, in hi view, is not entitled to exactly the same medi al care, but 
ev ryone is should receive at least adequate medical car .

Walk to Save Crest Canyon 
Tim O'Neil 

Last Saturday, a nature walk through 
Crest Canyon at 11 am at the intersection 
of Durango and Del Mar Heights Road , 
featured three scientists as guides. The 
walk was sponsored by the 'Citizens to 
ISave Crest Canyon'. 

According to Ann Williamson of the 
Citizens to Save Crest Canyon, "the pur-
pose of â€¢ the walk was primarily to 
stimulate interest and knowledge of the 
Canyon." The people in the tour walked 
through the canyon; while the 3 scientists 
explained the wildlife, fauna, and 
answered any questions that the par-
ticipators had. 

The three scientists were: Michael 
Soule, zoologist at UCSD; John Hawkins, 
geologist at the Scripps Institute 
and Helen Witham, botanist at the 
Natural History Museum of San 
Diego. 

The Ci~izens to Save Crest Canyon, are a 
group of landowners in the Crest Canyon 
and surrounding area, who are trying to 
make the Canyon into an open park. 

Currently, there is a plan for a con-
dominium developement in the canyon 
on file in the San Diego's city Planner's 
Office. The group wishes to buy the land 
and set it aside, before flits beauty is 
ruined by the developement." 

For the citiz ns to purchase the land, 
they must form an a ses ment district first. 
Th propo ed area of this di trict is : north 
from the Carmel Vall y Road to the river 
bed flats, about the site of the old airport 
road outh of the rac track; and we t 
from Inter tat 5 to old Highway 101 , 
known as Camino D I Mar. 

According to Bob Caine, community 
d velop r in the an Diego City Pla r,ner 
Office. "Th formation of thi asses m nt 
di tri t pos s om problems." The fir tis 
that ther are two judical dist rict in-
volved; D I Mar and an Di 0 Cit . 

ond, it will r quir th joint work nd 
ontrol of th e two di tricts to have th 

as m nt di tri t . 
A Mi ion Hill i the only oth ram-

pie of an assessment district purchasing 
land for an open park, there are many 
uncertain procedures left to be decided. 

Thus, on May 31 , the City of San Diego 
and Del Mar will meet to decide the joint 
powers and regulations by wh ich to form 
this assessment district. 

Once the assessment district is formed, 
the Citizens to Save Crest Canyon will 
then circulate a petition asking for an 
assessment of the the canyon. The peti-
tion must have 60% of the landowners', 
who live in the assessment district, 
signatures before it can be submitted to 
the City of San Diego. 

Once the city has the petition, they will 
order an assessment. The assessed value 
of the canyon, minus the financial support 
of the city, will then be distributed 
amongst the landowner . 

A public hearing will then be held for 
the landowners to voice whether or not 
they want to pay their share of the value 
of the canyon. If the consent is yes, then 
the City of San Diego will buy the canyon. 

The financial support of the City of San 
Diego, for this project, has yet to be 
determined. On May 30 a meeting will be 
held to set up the general guid lines of 
the city's support.

Career Worrys? 
Do you need information about career jobs, where 

and how to look for themr Carrer-Education Planning 
Services (CEPS) has a collection of directories of 
employers, including many of those in San Diego, to 
whom you can apply. Individual copies of the College 
Placement Annual, "Career Opportunity Index" and 
"The Job Market, Employer Research, and Job Hun-
ting" are available to any student who is looking for 
employment following graduation.

offers you might expect from various types of in-
dustries, CEPS has a number of recent salary surveys 
which may help. Projections about future employment 
trends from numerous sources are also available to 
help you in your career plannir,g.

Learning Faire II 
The second learning faire of this quarter will occur 

on Wednesday May 30 at Muir Commons from 12-3. 
Some of the scheduled activities have occured in the 
other learning faires that have taken place over the last 
two quarters, as juggling and tie- dying. However, 
some new events are planned, as bodee painting, 
ora gamy, and macrame. An organizational meeting for 
those interested in sharing their ideas and perhaps 
some time is scheduled for Tuesday, May 29 at 11 :00 in 
the Students Educational Change and Development 
Center, located at lower Muir Commons. The in-
iatiative behind this Conference for Creative Ignorance 
is the Center, which also brought to you CAPE (Course 
and Professor Evaluations). The purpose of this day is to 
show new ways to approaching learning beyond the 
traditional totalitarian classroom structure. Formal lear-
ning tends to deal primarily with content to the 
exclusion of any process. An alternative model is 
possible by replacing authority and 
punishment/rewards with a community wh ich 
"generates its own motivations". 

Chinal Film Forum 
"If you want knowledge, you must take part in the 

practices of changing reality. If you want to know the 
taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating It 
yourseH .. . lf you want to know the theory and methods 
of revolution, you must take part in revolution. All 
genuine knowledge originates Ih direct experience." 

Mao Tse-tung, ... and if you want to know about 
China, come to the Chinal film forum this Thursday 
evening at 8:00 in the 20-2250 Auditorium. Sponsored 
jointly by the Committe on Concerned Asian Scholars, 
the China Studies program, and the Student 
Educational Change Center, it will include Edgar 
Snow's One Quarter of Humanity and the first West 
Coast screening of Dr. Joshua Horn's "",way With All 
Pests. 

Chinal few Americans realize how American their 
worldview of China is. One knows the Chinese ex-
perience by direct knowledge and then by firsthand 
accounts. Edgar Snow, William Hinton, Jan Mydral, 
Noam Chomsky, and Han Suyin have all presented 
first-hand reports that have been generally ignored. 
The Chinese aura is subtly pervading the country's 
consciousness: Nixon's sudden visit and recognition of 
the People's Republic, James Reston receiving an 
appendectomy with. .. acupuncture7, the Pentagon 
Papers implicating the CIA for the Tibetan crisis ... 

Edgar Snow first covered the Chinese Communist 
experience in 1936 when he lived in Venan, covering 
the rising organization of cadres and village life, 
interviewing Mao and Chou En-Iai over bridge games 
and on the front lines. On his re-visit to China, Snow 
documented his journey in color film the fruits of that 
revolution, its people, its leaders and the continuing 
re-visioning of the Cultural Revolution. His film deals 
with much of the daily interaction in China, and with 
the out of the ordinary matters to us, such as a filmed 
acupuncture operation. 

Joshua Horn is an English surgeon who has spent 
nineteen years working with Chinese doctors on 
bringing medical care within reach of the Republic's 
800,000,000. His book, Away With "",II Pests, .covers 
monumental undertakings that include the eradication 
of venereal disease and the eradication of 
schistosomiasis. This last disease that once infected 
almost a hundred million Chinese, is caused by a tiny 
snail that bores into the skin and resides in the liver and 
intestinal tract, re-breeding within and eventually 
weakening and killing the hosts. His movie is an 
exciting documentary on perhaps the best coordinated 
medical effort in the world today. 

Come and see for yourself the vision of China : Edgar 
Snow's One Quarter of Humanity and Joshua Horn's 
Away With All Pests, this Thursday, May 31st, at 8:00 
PM, on the Muir Campus, in the 20-2250 audirorium. 
Admission is $.75.

International Education This Week in Sacramento 
The San Dieg.o campus of the University of California will take on an international air 

June 1 through June 4 when 56 foreign scholars gather at the International Center to 
take part in the Far Western Conference on Higher Education. 

The gathering is one of three regional conferences to be held this year for foreign 
senior scholars who are studying in this country under the Fulbright-Hays Program. The 
conf renee is sponsored by the Committee on International Exchange of Persons which 
has backed similar conferences throughout the United States for many years with the 
assistance of a grant from thp Department of State. 

This will be the first time that such a conference has been held at UCSD. Chairman for 
the fou rt-day meeting is Dr. Roy Harvey Pearce, Dean of Graduate Studies and 

Researc~ at UCSD. 
The foreign scholars, many of them traveling with their families, represent 22 nations 

rang irg from Afghanistan to Yugoslavia . The schola rs, most of them faculty members of 
college and universities in th ir home countries, are currently studying at universitites throu !~houl th United States. Two of the 56 have spent the past acad mic year on the 
UC D C8ff1fJU'. 

Th regional conferences were established several years ago to give the visting 
schol~r an opportunity 10 explore current problems of world-wide interest in th area 
of hiJ her education. Most of the scholars will return to educational and re earch 
activrtle in th ir home countries and have expressed a desire to meet with Americans 
and 01 r scholars from abroad to discuss issues of international concern. 

COri uls from the various countries represented by th scholars and who live in San 
Diegc. have b en invited to attend along with UCSD faculty members who will serve as 
hosts during the four -day conference.

Financial Aid 
The Nixon Administration is advocating expanding by $360 million the federal student 

Financial Aid Program, bringing the total financial support for the program to more 
than $1 .5 billion. While students leaders welcome the expansion of funds they are 
concerned because the proposal would end Economic Opportunity Grants and 
National Defense Student Loans. Education 

The Assembly Education Committee has passed three bills to increase state assistance 
to higher education. AB 950, authored by Assemblyman Fra nk Lanterman (R-Pasadena), 
would increase the number of sta te scholarships given by 3,500 to a total of 15,000 a 
year. AB 23 by Assemblyman Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) will provide $1 .2 million for a state 
funded work study program. 

The third bill, by Assemblyman Willie Brown, would provide $13 million to establish 
an Educational Opportunity Program to assist lower income students. The bills will next 
be heard in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 

Student Boast 
Students at the state universities and colleges will be able to take two-year leaves of 

absence and return without penalty under a resolution approved by the Board of 
Trustees' Committee on Education Policy. The measure, which is opposed by the 
student body presidents, will be taken up by the full board. 

Blackout Rationing . 
A new state commission that could ration electricity in case of brownouts and would 

control development of all existing and potential power energy sources has been 
proposed by Assemblyman Charles Warren (D-Los Angeles) With the support of 
Assembly Speak r Bob Moretti. 

Assemblyman Warren, chairman of th Ass mbly Subcommittee on Electrical Energy 
Policy, said California faces th prospe t of mass power brownouts within the next fou r 
to six years unless something is done to head off the problem. 

"This I gislCltive proposal is a major first st p to rationally manage energy resources, 
particularly electrical energy in California," Warren said. 

P.E. Cut 
The Assembly has voted to nd the physical education requirement for students at 

California's junior colleges. The measure, inHoduc d by Assemblyman Kenneth Cory 
(D-Gard n Grove), passed on a 42-23 vote.

Creation Perspective 
Robert Williams and Jeff Morgan 

Many Creationists have been cowered 
by evolutionls <; and thei r scientif ic 
~rgument~. Toda y, however, there is a 
new mov\eml ' by Creationists to give 
physical evid fl ce for thei r point of view 
that God cre<Jted the universe. This new 
,lpproach has Jone little to qu II the 
century long ,('bat. On th con trary, 
there has been qUite a polariza t ion of 
opi nion in recpnt times. We have to 
wonder whprt , all these arguments are 
I('ading. A, "r r al ist would concur , no 
, 11(, will ever 1... (' able to prove either view 
!)eyond a shadow of a doubt. For eVp'1 if 
â€¢ ve were to find new fossil evidence in 
,upport of e"olution. it would never be 
cenain that God did not start the whole 
process at the beginning o f time. By the 
Sd me token, the creative power of God 
will n ver be able to be proven to a finite 
man as long as God remains infinite. And 
when God becomes computabl and 
equatable doesn't He cease to become 
God? 

What would J full knowledge of the 
crea l ion process reveal to us? Would it 
disprove the Bible, or would it only bring 
to lighl new interpretations of the text? 
rven now Ihpre are many Bible b lieving 

Christians evolutionists who see no com-
primise to their Christian faith. Though 
we do not nece ssarily promote a 
Christian-evolutionist synthesis, it is im-
portant to see that the pOSi tion does exist. 
This is possible b cause the Christian life 
is not dependant upon crcation. It is 
dependant upon a living and resurrected 
ChriSI , but pr%of of the Resu rr ction 
and proof of th e creationist theory can 
hardly be equatable. 

What is the rpa l iss ue behind thi s cen-
tury old struggle? Let u not forsake what 
vu r intellect has to give us, but let us not 
hide behind it. Are we merely involved in 
a d iscussion over sc ientific techn ique and 
evidence, or are we also dealing with an 
emotional issue? To the Christian, the 
Crea tion issue can hardly be considered 
as of life or death consequence. His daily 
relationship with God is not effected by 
how God made the universe . 
Nevertheless, man has found in thi s 
difference of opinion a way to avoid 
facing the question of God's reality . We 
must keep thi s discussion on the origin of 
man and the world in perspective, and 
fa p the question of God's rei vance in 
our everyday lives.

Curriculum Revisions: 
Where Are The Students? 

Leelle Andereon and Murray Francy 

Where are the students of Revelle? 
Fundamental curriculum revisions are un-
der way within the college, and who is 
doing the revising? It's the Faculty and the 
Administration , unfettered by con-
siderations of the student's point of view. 
Ask a faculty member which way his vote 
w ill go on the Humanities Sequence revi-
sion ballot. The most likely response is the 
" Way of the Wastebasket." If we're lucky, 
that is, because those that do vote, 
generally have no way of knowing what 
the students think about the Humanities 
Sequence. The AS was t erminated 
because no representation is better than 
misrepresentation, but that means that 
each of us must keep our own eye on 
what's happening. 

Speci fically, a few members of the 
Humanities department s are tired of 
teaching out of their disciplines in a mish-
mash sequence that pleases no one, and 
teaches very few. Their solution is to at 
least partially cut out the the inter-
disciplinary sequence and let the students 
do a mish-mash sequence of their own 
design. But wait , what was the purpose of 
the original Humaniti s Sequence? For 
that matter, what is the pu rpose of all the 
sequences that make up the formidable 
lower division requirements of Revelle 

College? The idea was to produce the all-
round student, the Neo-Renaissance man. 
Not a bad idea, if it could be done. It 
certainly is not done by cramming all sorts 
of diverse information into the student's 
every orifice. Yet this is what the present 
revisions propose. By keeping the same 
number of course requirements but 
slightly diverSifying the options, the the 
student doesn't get training in the basic 
skills essential for further study in any 
discipline. The All-Round student for 
which Revelle is organized, is one who is 
able to teach himself in any field. The 
purpose of these lower division re-
quirements, then, is to teach the student 
how to read and write efficiQntly, how to 
analyse and criticize and finally to have an 
appreciation and awareness of disciplines 
outside the area of study he may evenÂ· 
tually pursue. 

The so lution to the present difficulties 
with the Revell e curriculum is not to 
abandon the Revelle idea and return to an 
unintegrated self-service curriculum, but 
to reorganize the courses with in the pre-
sent sequences. It is possible to have a 
wellorganized curriculum that produces 
well-trained as well as creat ive students. 
That should be our goal. 

The Good Americans 
Steve Nelnblatt 

In the aftermath of the My-Lai massacre 
one ca n only wonder how r eady 
Americans are to be "good Germans". In 
the june issue of 1972, Psychology Today 
printed the results of a survey relating to 
th events at My-Lai. The respondants 
listed in the survey 8989 in all-were selec-
tively chosen with the intention of 
questioning a representative sampling of 
the American populous. The answers 
offered by the respondants cause me 
much alarm and confusion. 

In 1945, General Tomoyuki Yamashita 
was tried and executed on charges that 
men under him had committed war 
crimes. His defense was that he did not 
ord r nor have any knowledge of the 
events ca rri ed out by inferior officers. In 
1972, 989 Ameri ca ns were asked if 
Yamashita should have been convicted 
for war crimes he did not order. The same 
989 Americans were asked if American 
generals should be convicted for war 
rimes they did not com mi t. 26 percen t of 

th e respo nd ants would convict the 
japanese officer whereas, only 22 percent 
would convict the American officer. 45 
percent would not convict th e japanese 
officer and 62 percent would definitely 
not convict the America n. The interesting 
and most revealing aspect of the question 
are the percentages who idd did not 
know whether these men should have 
been convicted. 30 percent did not know 
whether the japanese should be con-
victed and only 14 percent d id not know 
in the case of the American generals. The 
16 percent difference went from not 
knowing in the case of the Japanese to a 
def inite no in the case of the Ameri can. 

When asked if Germans should have 
been convicted at Nuremburg for war 
crimes ordered by superiors, 39 percen t 
said they should have been convicted. 
When asked the same question only sub-
situting American for German, only 29 
percent were willing to convict Americans 
who had committed war crimes ordered 
by sup riars. 

It i apparent that America ns are far 
more willing to convict Germans and 
Japanese for committ ing cri mes again t 
humanity, than to convict Am~ricans . I 
find this idea frightening . If a majority of 
Ameri cans think tha t America ns co mmit-
ting war crimes should b x Iud d from 
ob ying interna tional law stablished at 
Nuremburg in 1946, the on ly forc 
working to pr v nt such a tions is th 
p rsonal moral cod of an individual. 

Th .hope of personal morality preven-
ting such occu renc ar slim in vi w of 
th following statisti s. Only 17 p r nt of 
th r pondants maintained that Calleys' 

actions were a violation of morality. 17 
percent of all America, maintaining that 
killing unarmed men, woman and 
children is immoral is not a very im-
press ive or encouraging statis tic. Probably 
alma t 17 P rcent o f all American's 
felt that the ' Nazi indiscriminate 
killing of jews was immora l, what good 
did they do? 

When asked what most people would 
do if ordered to shoot all inhabitants of a 
Viet names village, 67 percent fel t that 
most Americans would follow orders. 
Onl y 19 percent felt that most would 
refuse to obey orders. When asked what 
they personally would do, 51 percent said 
th ey would follow orders and shoot, only 
33 percent said that they would refuse to 
shoot. I would argue that a large part of 
the 33 percent who stated they would not 
obey orders, would be right along side of 
Call ey shooting those I)abies. It is easy for 
an individual to say he would not shoot 
when he is speaking with a man in a suit 
wi th a pencil in hi s hand. If that man had a 
ma hine gun in his hand, you just 
watched him shoot fifty people, and he 
said he would fill you full of holes if you 

. did not obey, you would be more apt to 
obey than not. M any veterans of the 
events at M y-La i have sworn that Calley 
threatened to shoot them if they did not 
follow orders. Only one out of the hun-
dreds who were at My-Lai that day has 
said that he put down his gun and walked 
away wh en threatened by Calley. Calley 
did not $hoot. Th e other interesting con-
clusion that can be drawn from these 
statistics is the willingness of individuals to 
say other people would do immoral 
things, but they perso nally would not . 

In terms of rights and wrongs, 56 per-
cent of the respondants felt that Calley's 
act ions were si milar to the bombing raids 
on the North. Despite the fact that a 
majority of Americans-assuming that the 
respondants indeed are a representative 
sampling-feel that Calleys' actions and the 
bombings are similar, the bombings con-
tinue, they conti nue with popular sup-
port , they contin ue under the label 
" Peace With Honor ." From this on can 
on ly conclude that Americans feel that 
My-Lai was also honorabl . 

If less than one out of five felt that 
all y , actions w re immoral, if more 

than half of Ameri as' population admit 
they would have shot those civilians, if 
over half vi w our mombing raids as 
similar to th ev nts at My-Lai, one can 
only wond r how far Americans are from 
committing any violen e authorlti s say is 
nec ary.

Charges of Vandalism 
Ignoring the Issues 

To Editors, Triton TImes: 
In the United States laws 

are designed to protect the 
" freedoms" of the majority 
co mm unity . When the 
minorities try to express or 
use these freedoms they 
are violently suppressed 
When normal means of ex-
pression such as signs on 
Urey Hall are removed by 
reactionary students, ad-
ministration or staff, then 
expression through other 
means become necessary. 

The letters you have 
received are all perfect ex-
amples of the middle class 
bourgeoisie mentality that 
I mentioned in my first 
letter. 

'NOW YOU KNOW WHY I NEVIR WATCH TV-ALL THEY GIVE US IS CRIME PROGRAMSI' 

They are people who 
have never been op -
pressed or subjugated 
because of their race or 
origin . 

Can We 
Condone the 
Horrors of 
Vietnam? 

These standards are 
applicable to society as a 
who le . The actions of 
Ricardo Chavez Ortiz are 
easily justifiable when one 
looks at the acts of sup-
press ion and Neo-
Colonization used by so 
ca lled authori ties against 
minorities today. 

People who have no 
commitment except to 
their egotistical self. The 
only reason they took time 
out to answer my letters is 
because they feel their 
niche threatened. They are 
nothing more than a group 
of bleeding heart white 
liberals afraid of i nvolve-
ment or a deep commit-
ment. 

Editor: 
If the result of every 

Kev in Olson outburst of 
unsubstantiated diatribe 
were letters such as Le 
Cong Phung's in the May

him to write more. The

Sisters Share A Ride 
A UCSD Women'e Collective 

Between 1960 and 1970 in the U.S. the 
crime of rape increase 124% (F .B.1. 
Unifo rm Crime Report, 1970-1971). In 
light of that evidence the time has come 
for women to act against such brutality. As 
part of the many fronts now emerging in 
this battle, a group of women is 
organizing a ca mpaign to encourage 
women who must hitch-hike to ride only 
with other women . It is felt that this 
greatly lessens the chances of any kind of 
physical danger to women hitch -h ikers, 
and of course, eliminates the chances of 
them being raped. 

The aid of schools, churches, and other ' 
comm unity organizations has been 
enlisted to relay the message to all poten-
tial women hitch-hikers and, equally im-
portant , to inform women drivers of the 
importance of their role in alleviating the 
problem of rape. Bumper stickers which 
say, "Sisters Share a Ride" are being 
distributed to women around the county. 
One point of distribution is the Women's 
Store, 4157 Adams Avenue. 

The campaign was stimulated by recent 
~apes and murders of h itch-hiking women 
In the cou nty which point to the obvious 
necessity of taking measures to prevent 
these sorts of crimes in the future. A 
special urgency for the campaign rest of 

th ~ f~ct that summer is approaching and 
bnngtng an influx of people to the area 
who have no set means of transportation 

and are dependent of hitch -hiking to 
move around the city. Also students are 
not in school and many of them hitch-
hike. Such conditions make women 
among these groups vulnerable to assault. 

Women have traditionally responded to 
th fear of rape by denying themselves 
the freedom to move about. However, 
now that women are demanding the right 
to determine their own existence, alter-
native solutions to self protection are 
absolutely necess ry. 

In addition to sharing rides with 
women, other steps can be taken to lessen 
general transportat ion and hitch-hiking 
problems. Pressure for comprehensive 
bus systems can be directed toward city 
officials. Car pools can be organized and 
hitch-hiking in pairs can be initiated. This 
will also help problems of pollution and 
high gas costs. Skills in self-defense can be 
learned and are offered at low rates 
throughout the area. If women are raped, 
they should' contact a Rape Crisis Center 
which is being formed through the 
Women's Studies Dept. at San Diego State 
College. Contact with them will offer 
support and advice for a possible course 
of action . 

These steps are all necessary but at-
tainable only in the future. For now, 
sharing rides with sisters is an effective , 
simple, and immediate solution to a 
potential problem for women.

best pieces of writing I 
have read in the TT . 
Perhaps if more of us at 
UCSD were fa ced with the 
possibility of living in the 
devastation we condone by 
our passivity , we would 
find Vietnam worthy of 
more than occ asional 
thought, protest or letter to 
an editor. That is the horror 
of Mr. Olson's writing; as a 
Monday morning general 
he feels righteous in deter-
mining the lives and deaths 
of people he never has 
(and probably never will) 
seen, by means (bombing) 
he has obviously never ex-
perienced, and for an end 
that is refuted by anyone 
who has to live with it.

Activism Has 
Not Died ... 
Dear Triton Times, 

We read with some 
amusement in last Friday's 
issue the advertisement 
which began with "the ac-
tivism of the sixties has 
died." It made f urther 
statements which we 
would like to take the op-
portunity here to 
repudiate. 

The student movement is 
not dead by anymeans. 
This is true not only in the 
case of UCSD, but the rest 
of the country as well . If 
fact, student radicalism is 
on the increase. This is 
evidence by the growth in 
the number of student 
organizations on cam-
puses, and the parallel ex-
pansion of the alternative 
press. 

Earlier th is year, at the 
Southern University in 
louisiana , two Bl ack 
brothers were murdered 
by police during a student 
demonstration for needed 
changes on that campus. 
On this campus, UCSD 
Bla ck students held a 
moratorium in their 
memory. The incident, so 
recently occurred, makes 
us quest ion the validity of 
the statement found in the 
ad as to the decrease in 
violence in recent years 
due to the student move-
ment. We would also re-
mind the reader that the 
S.U. demonstration sur-
rounded student as well as 

, Black issues, and must be 
seen as an active move on 
the part of the student 
movement in this country 
as well as the continuing 
Black struggle . 

We r;an also find 

evidence on our own cam-
pus to negate the state-
ment of the death of ac-
t ivism. Since last May, 
radical activity has been 
growing . You ma y 
remember the hundreds of 
UCSD students who 
protested the Nixon 
ordered bomb ing of 
Haiphong harbo. , and the 
number of rallies and 
demonstrations that were 
held . A group of students 
even went so far as to walk , 
with a banner denouncing 
the move, from Muir cam-
pus to Horton Plaza in 
downtown San Diego . 
There , these students 
joined 8,000 people, a great 
majo ri ty students from sur-
rounding campuses, and 
went to the San Diego City 
Council chambers, where 
they demanded that the 
Council take an open posi -
t ion condemning the In-
do c hinese War . The 
resolut ion which wa sub-
mitted to accompl ish this 
move almost passed with a 
4 to 5 vote by Counci l 
members. 

At UCSD, from that poi r 
on , one issue after anothe, 
has been brought to stu-
dent atten tion 
throughrallies, teach-i ns,

Psycho Sources 
"PsychoSources is an access device for the field of 

psychology. It recognizes psychology and psy-
chotherapy as both arts and sciences, and it emphasizes 
that psychological analysis Is the joint province of 
philosphers, scientists, artists, mystics, poets, patients, 
film-makers, novelists, therapists and social critics. It 
examines the social, significance of psychological 
theory and practice, and the political significance of 
the individual's own consciousness. PssychoSources is 
not definitive; it is a montage of starting places and 
controversies. It is not intended to obviate the need to 
read the books themselves, to see the films, or to 
pursue the particular lines of thought. It is intended 
rather to . stimulate those needs." 

This definition introduces the latest product of the 
CRM corporation, responsible for numerous textbooks 
and such magazines as Psychology Today and Intellec-
tual Digest, and in brief but adequate terms it sets the 
limits and limitlessness of this catalogue for research. 
Based almost to the letter on the Whole Earth 
Calalogue in form, PsychoSources is a psychological 
yellow pages-with listings of hotlines, schools for 
humanistic psychology, growth centers, film sources 
and readings in the field. It analyses the several therapy 
styles, mattching readings with the styles, a.nd 
organizing the reading into' topics such as Identity, . 
learning, Roles, Culture and Commuf\ications . 
Whenever possible, the editors use direct quotes from ' 
the principals Spider Man speaks on adolescence, 
Freud on psychoanalysis (and women), R.D. laing on 
schizophrenic knots, Mental patients speak, paint of 
write for themselves in their own handwriting. 

Edited by Evelyn Shapiro and compiled by Barry 
Shapiro, the 224-page catalogue is an invaluable 
reference for study and writing in the field of psy-
chology, a must for the demands of final papers and 
exams. PsychoSources was designed by Tom Suzuki, 
Dugald Stermer and Barry Shapiro and is generously 
illustrated with line drawings, photographs, collages 
and other graph ics. It is available now for $5 at the 
campus bookstore and other outlets.

1 He was known as "EI Jefe" 

(the Chief) on the Mexican 
location for filming. Playboy 
Magazine dubbed him the 

I "Picasso of Violence;" critics have called him a genius. 
Dustin Hoffman said, "It's 
ironic that he's alive now ... a 
gunfighter in an age when 
we're flying to the moon." 
And Steve Mcqueen was so 
impressed he made two films 
with him in a row. 

"He" is Sam Pecklnpah, 
commercially and critically 
just about the most in-

troversial American filmmaker 
working today. And he has 
just finished doing what he 
likes best, shooting a western, 
his first In four years, "Pat 
Garrett and Billy the Kid," for 
Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer, 
starring James Coburn , Kris 
Kristofferson, and Bob Dylan. 

The film, which Gordon 
Carroll produced from an 
original screen play by Rudy 
Wurlitzer for MGM, is one 
that Peckinpah was particular-
ly pleased to direct. It is th l! 
actionfilled story of an ex-
outlaw, Pat Garrett, and his 
hunt for the escaped Billy the 
Kid across the American 
southwest at a time when the 
West as these men knew It was 
rapidly changing to make way 
for the Money Men from the

Rudy Wuriltzer, the novelist

the scripl, "but as my concep-
tion of the character changed 
I thought of Dylan more as 
Alias. Alias is an observer. He, 
more than anyone else in the 
film, is aware of Billy's

he liked what he saw. He 
wrote a song about Billy 
which will be included in the 
film and returned to Durango 
a few weeks later with his wife 
Sarah, five children and the 
family dog, ready to work. He 
enthUSiastically threw himself 
into his two new roles: that of 
an actor, and of Alias. He 
learned to ride, rope, helped 
assemble his wardrobe , 
learned his lines and began 
working some days later in a 
scene in which he and Billy, 
out 10 rustle steers, become 
diverted by wild turkeys only 
to return to the cows to dis-
cover that one of the ir gang 
had been killed . In the rushes 
he looked like a natural, as if 
he had been mak ing films 
forever. 

When the cameras were 
turning, Peckinpah's attention 
was completely directed to 
what was going on revealing 
not only a sure knowledge of 
his craft but also of his subject. 
Reaching a snag he thinks 
quietl y and qu ickly solves the 

problem of some cows who 
refuse to go in the right direc-
tion. 

"Feed 'em hay on that spot 
for a few minutes," he would 
instruct a wrangler . "Then 
chase 'em away. When the 
cameras roll they'll go back to 
it. " 

Th is intuitive understanding 
is a part of Peckinpah 's past. 
He was raised on a ranch in 
San Joaquin Valley, 
des ce nd ed from pioneer 
stock . 

"My earliesi memory is of 
being strapped in the saddle 

. when I was two for a ride up 
in the h igh cou ntry," he ex-
plained . "We were always 
close to the mounta ins. 
Always going back to them." 
He looks wistfully around at 
the Mexican landscape. "It's 
mostly all gone now. Fresno's 
like a little l.A., and the cou n-
try around it is chopped up 
with new roads and resort 
faci li ties ." 

And so rather than an ex-
plosive man of violence, Sam 
Pe ckinpah is a se rious 
craftsman and art ist whose 
success lies in his ability to 
recreate on film a time and 
place that are long gone. But 
he himself might disavow this. 

"When you're do ing a 
period p icture, the period 
matters less than what the 
thing is about . I don't mean 
one should be slack or 
anachro nistic but one should 
concentrate on the 
characters. I become all the 
characters in the films I do 
and so do the actors, like I 
said about Coburn and Kris. 
And when the characters 
you've got are Pat Garrett and 
Billy the Kid, well, it seems 
like you 've got it made." He 
smiles broadly. " like I say. 
This one smell s good ." 

Summer Shakespeare 
A repertory of three diverse dramas from the works 

created by William Shakespeare will be presented this 
summer at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre. 

R~creating the brilliance, excitement and splendor 
of sixteenth century England, the San Diego National 

Sha~edpeare Festi.v~1 is performed in a funct ioning 
replica of the orrglnal Globe Playhouse in London 
where Shakespeare's plays were originally performed. 

The trio of plays produced this season during the 
twenty-fourth Festival at the Old Globe Theatre will 
open June 5 and continue through September 16. 
Producing Director of the Old Globe Theatre is Craig 
Noel. 

Inaugurating the summer Festival on June 5 will be 
the romance and drama of "The Merchant of Venice." 
As conceived by director Eric Christmas, the popular 
play is being designed and staged "in a free interpreta-
tion influenced by the manners and mores of the early 
Italian Renaissance." The famed confrontation 
between the money lender Shylock opposed by the 
Venetian establishment creates some of the finest 
moments in all of world drama. During the past two 
summers, director Christmas has staged "Love's 
labour lost" and "A Midsummer Night 's Dream." 
Costumes have been designed by Douglas Russell with 
the setting designed by ART DIRECTOR Peggy 
Kellner. 

Utilizing the Shakespearean text , director Allen 
Fletcher and composer Conrad Susa have created a 
musical comedy of "Two Gentlemen of Verona." 
Costumed in the late seventeenth century in a fanciful 
commedia del arte style by Edguard Johnson, the plot 
revolved around the romantic complications involving 
two pairs of young lovers. To open on June 8, romantic 
rivalry, disguises, parental d isavowal and betrayed 
friend ships provide comedy elements in "Two 
Gentlemen of Verona." 

The repertory of productions will be completed this 
season with "Ki ng Lear." The great tragedy will open 
July 10 under the direction of Edward Payson Call. lear, 
the aging medieval English monarch, divided his 
kingdom between three daughter the size of each 
portion to be determined by proof of affection by each 
daughter for their father. Call directed the tragedy 
"King Richard III" last summer for the Old Globe 
Theatre. Miss Kellner will design the costumes for 
" King Lear."

Jerry Applebaum Speaks on Government and the Media 
TI.OÂ· ... I 

Jerry Applebaum, former writer for the 
L.A. FREE PRESS, was convicted for prin-
ting a list of undercover agents of the 
Federal Bureau Narcotics, in August of 
1969. He was sentenced 1 to 10 years in 
the State Prison and $5,000 in fines. 

Recently, the state supreme court un-
animously ruled to overturn Applebaum's 
conviction. Now released, Applebaum is 
currently the editor of Alternate Feature 
Service. 

The following is part of an interview 
that Applebaum held for KSDT radio 
station, on his visit here May 16. 

KSDT:Could you give a summary of 
what happened in regards to you r arrest? 

Applebaum: I was approached by a man 
from the Attorney General's Office. He 
waid that he had some papers that might 
be of interest to me. One was a report 
about corruption in the UCLA Police 
Force. The other was a roster of names, 
addresses, and phone numbers of the 
State Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement 
Officers. I printed one, the one on 
UCLA's corrupt police force. About a 
week later, I printed the other one to 
accompany an editorial on "Why the 
need of Secret Police~" Two weeks later 
we were charged to appear before the 
L.A. Judicial Court. 

KSDT: Wha t was your circulation 
numbers at that time? 

Applebaum: About 19 or 20 thousand. 
KSDT: What was the reaction to the 

articles? 
Applebaum: Attorney General O'Brian 

and most everyone was pretty upset with 
the printing of the first article. They said 
that it was true about the corruption, but 
that they were investigating it. They also 
said that they hadn't wanted it published 
so soon, as it would hurt the chances of 
the officers getting a fair trial. On the 
second article, there was a lot of heated 
criticism. Almost all the papers were run-
ning editorials against our actions, only 
the underground papers were supporting 
us. A good example was the L.A .TIMES. 
They refused ' to run a word of the facts, 
and they did everything they could to 

. ensure that we would not get a fair trial. 
They misrepresented the testimonies in 
their editorials, and they left ommissions 
out so as to make it sound by the 
omissions that we were wrong. This gave a 
lot of people a distorted viewpoint. Six 
weeks after the trial though, the TIMES 
realized that it had made a mistake. So it 
ran a full page editorial saying that our 
conviction was a great threat to the 
freedom of the press. 

KSDT:What exactly were you indicted 
for? 

Applebaum : One account was for 
receiving stolen property. The other was a 
junction saying that we could not publish 
anything that came from the Attorney 

General's Office, unless it was a handout. 
That meant that we cou ldn't publish a 
thing unless the Attorney General ap-
proved it. That was a violation of our 
freedom of the press. 

KSDT: Was there anything unusual 
about the trial? 

Applebaum: Yes, the Attorney General 
did the prosecuting as compared to the 
regular state prosecutor. 

KSDT: How many were indited? 
Applebaum: Three: Art Conklin, Jerry 

Resin, and myself. . 
KSDT : Why do you think that the State 

Supreme Court overturned your case and 
conviction? 

Applebaum: It was not for the con-
stitutional reasons of the case, but they 
overruled the case on this very technical 
grounds charge. The technicality was that 
the jury wasn's given proper testimony 
that I knew the documents were stolen. It 
is the same type of little technical charges 
they had to throw the Pentagon Papers 
out of the courts with . 

KSDT:What ever happened about the 
UCLA easel 

Applebaum : They fired some of them 
but most of the officers were reshuffled to 
other UC campuses. In fact, one of them 
was sent down here, but I don't know if 
he's still around. 

KSDT: About how many of the UCLA 

Police Officers were involved? 

Applebaum: Six or s ven, plus the 
chief, who never got fired, and is still 
there today. 

KSDT: Why is the government con-
c rned with leaks of evidence? 

Applebaum: The government do sn't 
want to be embarrassed . When you have a 
bunch of gangsters in the highest offices, 
and you expose them, they are going to 
go out and get you. They are wire-tapping 
themselves and the free presses, be ause 
the free press is a threat to them. 

kSDT: What do you see in store in the 
future for the free presses and the 
government? 

Applebaum: The government is not a 
people's government. There are a lot of 
problems in this country. The only way to 
deal with them is for the people to unite 
and recognize that we have certain basic 
interests, and that they are not syn-
onymous with the interests of the govern-
ment. The constructed role of the media 
in this country is to try and change the 
socia l structure. But it can't do it by itself; 
but it will playa role. A good example is 
the the WASHINGTON POST. They have 
done an excellent job with the Watergate 
Affair. They are getting a lot of muck out 
of there. 

End to Hitchhiking Sought by Assembly Fair Photos 
Hitchhikers and bicyclists have found friends in the 

sta te Capitol. Assemblymen John Dunlap and Dixon 
Arnett, and Senator James Mi"s have a" recently 
introduced bills which would promote smog free 
alternative modes of transportation. With gas prices 
soari ng and smog problems worsening, the trend has 
been toward nonmotorized forms of transportation, 
particularly among college students. 

Assemblyman Dunlap has two bills which could 
prove to be a boon for nonmotorized travel. The first 
bill, AB 1284, would require the Department of Parks 
and Recreation to establish overnight accomodations 
for non motorized travelers within a" existing and 
future units of the state park system, At present, state 
park campsights are designed with the family vacation 
in mind; AB 1284 recognizes that the needs of growing 
number of travelers are different from those of the 
traditional family unit. 

Assemblyman Dunlap also introduced AB 1457 which 
wou ld au thorize the Department of Motor Vehicles to 
issue hitchhiking cards. This idea grew out of a system 
in Poland which licenses hitchhikers and provides 
positi ve inducements for motori sts to pick up 
hitchhikers. By granting permits, Dunlap feels that 
Contrary to some fears, the bill does not require all 
hitchhikers to be licensed, and is in no manner in-
tended to restrict hitchhikir:g. 

A bill before the legislature, AB 2025, is designed to 
elim inate hitchhiking. Assemblyman Thurman's bill 

would make it i"egal to solicit rides on a highway or 
roadway. Students of transportation would be severely 
affected were this bill to become law. Unfortunately, 
few legislators are aware of the students' perspective. 
There is a need for students to students as they pertain 
to transportation . 

In addition to the hitchhiking legislation, two bills 
have been introduced to facilitate bicycle use in the 
state. Senator James Mills is sponsoring SCR 47 whic:, 
requests that a study be done to review the problems of 
bicycle travel in California. Senator Mills makes note in 
the bill of the ambiguous nature of the California 
Vihicle Code as it currently relates to Assemblyman 
Dixon Arnett has introduced another bill, AB 916 which 
would establish an Advisory Committee on Bicycle 
Transportation, Safety and Recreation . Adoption of 
these two bills would be a positive step toward up-
dati ng laws and sett;ng up bikeways and facilities 
statewide. 

Support of AB 916, AB 1284, AB 1457 and SCR 47 
would be in the best interests of all students. Students 
can play an active part in the process by writing open 
letters to the legislature expressi ng their support of 
these bills and their opposition to AB 2025 These 
letters should be sent to Mike Clough, UC Student 
Lobby, 926 "J" St. Room 216, Sacramento, California, 
95814. Persons interested in testifying before com-
mittees in Sacramento on the bills should ca ll Mike 
Clough in Sacramento, 916-442-3827.

Educational Policy and 
Courses - This is a faculty 
committee which could 
perhaps be described as 
one of the most important 
and influent ial of all 
Senate committees. CEP 
has the job of rev iewing 
and approving all matters 
of und er gradu a t e 
edu cational pol icy wh ich 
incl ud es, among other 
things, approvi ng new ma-
jors, departments, and 
gradi ng policy. CEP al so 
has a su bco mm ittee called 
t h e C omm i tt ee on 
Undergradu a te Course s 
whose task is to review and 
app rove all new courses. 
There is one st u d ent 
member of the com mittee, 
but this person does not 
have voting po w er. 
Whoever takes on this job 
should expect to be able to 
attend weekly meeti ngs 
(about 2 hours), and 
perhaps another hour or 
two should be spent in 
preparation. The student 
member should do his best 
to become involved closely 
in all issues coming before 
the committee which 
mea ns assumi ng an out-
spoken and active role . (2 
at la rge, 1 grad) . 

Activism Has Not Died

organized around have 
been the Indochina War, 
the farmworker's struggle, 
the anti- mi litary recruiter 
move, freedom of speech, 
daycare, in stitutional ized 
sexism and racism, to name 
a few. We can reme mber 
the Vietnam teach-in last 
Fall, the events around the 
coming of the milit ary 
recruiters, and the student 
organized Safeway

Executive and Policy 
Committee - This com-
mittee deals mainly with 
facu Ity/administrative 
problems. The students sit-
ting on this committee 
have no vote, are never 
asked for their opinions. 
Topics dealt with are facul-
ty conduct, agenda setting 
for the Senate, task force 
recommendations for 
University library policy. 
This committee has poten-
tial for keeping students 
informed as to what is 
going on in the Senate . 
Since students don 't have 
the right to the floor in the 
regular Senate, they can 
propose resolutions in this 
body (but they can' t se-
cond them) . If the 
Academic Senate changes 
its bylaws before the end of 
th is year, this committee 
could have enlarged 
responsibilities and poten-
tial. (1 consu Itant from 
each college and 2 grad 
stude nts or consultants). 

Library - The library 
comm itt e e advi ses the 
Chancellor on the opera-
tion of the library at UCSD. 
It pre pares budgets, looks 
over personnel and advises 
th e C han c ell o r o n a ll 
matters relating to library 
poli cy. (1 at large consul -
ta nt, 1 grad ). 

Specia l Scho larships -
This committee assists a nd 
advises the admin istratio n 
in carrying ou t the special 
job and scholars hi p oppor-
tunity program. (1 fro m 
each college). 

University Welfare -
This committee is respo nsi-
ble for keeping the division 
aware if events lor actions 
are being taken that affect 
the welfare of the Universi-
ty. (1 at large consultant). 

Chancel/or's Advi ory 
Committee on Student Life 
and Interests - This group 
replaced what was known 

the co n se rvati v e 
ne w spaper D ime nsio n 
which used to air pro-U .S. 
government propaganda. 
The La Jolla businessmen 
who supported (in part) 
the financial existence of 
this paper must have been 
disappointedthey probably 
were th e only ones. On the 
other hand , the North Star 
ha s grown into a more 
viable form of information, 
transforming from the 
Crazy Times format into its 
present o n e, This 
rep resents a marked step 
forward o n the newspa per 
with a radical perspective. 
Nine, althoug h it has on ly 
published one issue, is also 
a progressive Black voice 
wh ic h ma y b e 
publ ished _ in the future . 
N e x t year , the s e 
ne wspapers will al mos t 
certainly be expanding 
with the support of the 
UCSD student body. 

Pe rhaps it is nd longer 
necessary here to spend 
more time repudiating the 
nonsense which was found 
in the Vote ad. We would 

as the AS and concerns 
itself with all issues regar-
ding student life at UCSD. 
both social and academic. 
This new group has great 
potential and would be 
ideal for anyone wishing to 
have an impact on the 
course of UCSD's student 
government , It allocates 
approximately S100,OOO (3 
from each college, 1 from 
each recognized minority 
group) . 

Muir Colle ge 
Curriculum Revie w and 
Development Board -
This board is responsible 
for encouraging new

edu cation requirements, 
approval of courses for

moni toring and evaluating 
e xi sting classes which 
sat is fy the genera I 
educational requirements. 
The boards consists of five 
faculty and four students . 
(4 Mu ir students). 

Polilica l Science Search 
Committee - This com-
mittee is a special Ad Hoc 
committee set up to look 
for a Chairm a n of th e 
Politica l Science Depart -
ment. Basically it involves 
going to sem inars whe re 
prosepective ch ai rpersons
