Rethinking our nuclear strategy in Europe 
UY ;\-IATTHEW PAYNE 

and MARC WARBl'RTON 
One of Ihe man) items in the new" that r('Cluire.., 

some analysi., is t he Idea of makll1g Europe a 
"nuclear free zone." A.,., much as \\e \\'ou lei It ke to see 
Europe - and t he world - become such zones, there 
arc t w() object ions t hat must be raised: t he nature of 
treaties and the nature of the threat faCIng Europe 

A fundamental difference exists bet\\een treaties 
concern ing the production and deployment of arms 
and treati s limiting their use. Theoret Icall y, 
treaties Itmiting the production and deployment of 
nuclear weapons ca n be made \'erifiable, sll1ce in 
principle the ex istence of material objects can be 
detected . An agreement forswearing tbe usc of 
nuclear weapons i., only verifiable when a) thegiven 
conflict is over and said WCaIX)J1S h,l\'e not I en u. cd 
or, b) the wealxm is used. i.e. negati\e verificatHII1. 

Additionally when two coun tries go to war. the 
diplomatic and world opi l1lon foundations on whIch 
t reati s are built i" all but wiped out. The Idea of t\\'o 
cou ntries (or alliances) at war and s\\orn to one 
another's destruction not using a particular type of 
weapon simply because of a treat, is not reasonable, 
Certainly oth r gexxl reason" may ex ist for tht' 
nations to follow the treatv. but the 'xistenceof the 
treat y per "e or the fear -of being denounc d 3s a 
treat y \'iolator are not among them, 

So to base a na t ion's s curit von mere words i" to

('olllinued [rulll pa~e 2 
gan's Upper Penin su la ha\'e 
fought a long and ongoi ng 
battle agai nst th e Pen tagon's 
plan to place a massi\'e 
underground nuclear submar-
ine antenna in th ir pristi n , 
peaceful wilderness - making 
it a firs t 'strike nuclear target. 

Thi s is not to suggebt that 
onl\' immediate self ·in t rest 
wili compel people to resist the 
nuclear arms buildup; but self-
interest is certain ly a powerful 
motive. Many Europeans who 
have demonstrated against

\',:ould be perfectly wi lling to

\\' here . preferably on su bmar·

increasing l y they are 
demanding to be their own 
k1l1gs, After 37 years of 
postwar inferiority. they are 

beginning to recognize - as 
the fo'rench did 15 yea rs ago-
t hat Europe can and should 
mak its voice hard: that its 
own unique perspective on the 
ba t tIe of the nuclear titans 
may offertheonly escape route 
from unwinnable nuclear war. 
The recent decision to 
es tabli sh a Europ an military 
affairs committ ee within the 
European Economic Com -
munity - without .S. or 
Soviet input - represents a 
bold, perhaps hi sto ric, step in 
thi . direction. 

Thi s movement toward an 
unfettered Europe that is 
neither neutral nor a mere 
Americn pawn inspires the 
anti -nuclear activists with a 
kind of po s itivi s m and 
idea li sm that characterized 
the mass youth movement and 
anti-war movem nt in the 
Un it ed States in the I 960s . It

Meanwhile, the well·respected 
International Ins titute for 
Strategic Studies in London 
publi shed a paper last month 
stating, "Once it begins there 
can really be no possibility of 
controlling nuclear war." 

their teach·in including a 
speech by Governor Jerry 
Brown. Reggie had his reasons 

On most campuses, the 
national teach·in included a 
brief introductory course on 
the logistics, dimensions and 
the likely outcome of a nuclear 
war. There were slide shows of 
missile systems, diagrams 
about the effects of nuclear 
blast radiation, and plenty of 
questions from the audience. 

One les on many under· 
graduates may have learned is 
that neither the U.S. nor the 
Soviet Union can truly 
"contain " a nuclear war . 
Leonid Brezhne v even 
admitted this to a German 

For most schools , the teach· 
in was a one· peaker, one· 
night affair . On other 
campuses, however, favori tes 
such as scientist Carl Sagan, 
economist Paul Samuelson 
and Sen . Gary Hart are 
speaking, as well as a handful 
o f Nobe l Pri ze·w innin g 
phys icists. The University of

Veterans Da y events aren't

They know, moveover, that 
Ronald Reagan won 't be able to 
dismiss their efforts as easily 
as he has brushed aside the

held recentl y in Western

Editor: 
Tom Schlosser 's comments 

on a recent AS Council 
meeting - "Reggie didn't have 
to listen" (Guardian, Nov. 2) -
reveal only part of the picture. 

The CWO's Political Film 
Series is in its fifth year 
preci s ely becaus e the AS 
Cou nci l listen. It listens to 
students who fill TLH 107 
every Friday night. It listens to 
profes ors who laud the serie 
as a vital contribu tion to the 
free exchange of ideas within 
the Univers ity . It li ·tens to the 
San Diego press who prai e 

the series as "an impress ive 
selection of politically oriented 
cinema from around theworld, 
much of it new to San Diego 
screens. (Reader). " 

Reggie didn 't have to listen 
to the arguments being raised 
agains t CWO because he had 
already listened to that same 
s tudent, Wade Bickel. for the 
prev ious two hours. He didn 't 
have to li sten beca use CWO 
o pp o n e nt s are m er el y 
rehas hing th e same argu · 
ments they used in their 
unsuccessful bid to block the 
film series las t Spring. 

Reggie. in short, was not 
refu sing to listen. He was 
refu sing 10 be coerced by a 
mall bu t voca l band of 

"CIA·'ers. He simply saw Ihat 
th e line between listening and 
being browbeaten had been 
crossed, and he refused to go 
fu rl her. 

Following the vote·changing 
farce that led to passage of I he 
AWACS sale, It'S nice to see 
some elected officials whose 
principles don't succum b to 
th e loudesl lobby ist.

Trial for UCSD 34 arr est ed at 
Tolbert s it in s lated for today 

BY BILL FI H 
laff Wriler 

tudents arre ted last 
spring during a peaceful sit·in 
of Chance llor Atkinson's 
office, go on trial today at 3:00. 

Prompting the sit ·in was a 
li st of eight demands, one of 
which was tha t Hi story 
Profes or Emory Tolbert be 
granted tenure, 

The group of 34 students 
face charge of "trespassing" 
and "failure to disperse." 

Commissioner of Student 
Welfare Reggie Williams, the 
on ly AS member in the group. 
claims that " it is highly 
unlikely that the charges \\ill 
be dropped." 

T he charges, being pressed 
by the district attorney - not 
by the chancel lor - cou ld 
involve a maximum sentence 
of six mont hs injail plus a fine. 
" [ rea ll y doubt that will 
happen, though," says 
Williams. 

William is not sure if the 
protestors are required to 
enter a plea today , but claims 
that the group will probably 
plead "not guilty depending, of 
course. on how everyone 
feels. " 

The sit·in June 2 last spring 
involved almost 300 l'CSO 
!-.tud nts. But a group of :~-l 
refused to budge after threats 
made hv Atkin<;on that police 

would arrest anyone inside the 
office on his "order." The 
students were soon arrested in 
a non·violent fashion . 

"We had a lot of support 
from the tudents who were 
there," s ays Williams. " [ 
think, though , that now 
tudents have a tendency to 

put the issue In t he back of 
their minds." 

When asked if any progress 
ha been madeince the arrest 
on June 2 regarding the list of 
demands, the AS member 
replied, "that's a hard 
question to answer. An 
agreement IS still trying to be 
reached, "

Amidst these concerns for 
adequate nutrition. one

F(,~ti\ al. So. I looked forward to an intere'iting 
e\'('ning. And thal's exaclly what I got. 

But not before I became totallv confused as 
to what I was reall y watching. -(he firs t scene 
i", a documentation of the actual production: 
the actress s tanding patiently behind the 
slate. the director calling a tion. and so on. 
The next scene is t he fi lm ' . own plot: it's 1867 
in England's Lyme Regi . Anthropologist 
Charle ' mithson arrives at the home of his 
fiancee, Ernestina Freeman, to make a shah 
marriag prolXlsal. he readily accepts. -

The following scene looks I ike a con t inuat ion 
of t he plot : Charles is asleep when t he phone 
rings . Wait a minute, That's impossible. 
Alexander Graham Bell invented the 
telephone in 1876, nine years after this story's 
supposed to take place. Anot her incongruity: 
the camcra shows a woman in Charles' 
1x.>cI ... and it's not Ernest ina . But , e\'en if it was 
her. that wou Idn't be right. because this was 
Victorian England a nd the moral code was 
much stricter then. I/ it was Victorian 
England. 

That 's when the lightbulb lit up. The French 
UCllf£'IItIIlI's Woman is essentially a double 
feat url'. One ~ torv is about Charles; encounter 
\\ it h Sarah W()(idruff. a woman of dubious 
repute. rl' ;, ult ing from an affair wit h a married 
French lreutenanl. hence the title. The other

Cab driver stabbed 
BY RU 

A cab driver is in fair 
condition toda y after being 
stabbed by a pa senger who 
refused to pay his fare . 

Steve Wat son , a cab driver 
of the Radio Cab Compan y, 
wa stabbed shortly before 2 
a.m. in the vicinity of Third 
College by a suspect who 
campus police say wa a non· 
student but who had friends 
at tending UCSD. The su pect 
has not been a pprehended yet. 

Wat on allegedl y picked up 
the suspect at the Greyhound 
bu terminal in downtown an 
Diego. Upon a rriv ing a t 
UCSD , Ihe suspect told 
Watson that he could not 
produd the SUl.OO cabfare 
and tha t he would go and g t 
money from som fr iend: As 
collateral, Watson ask d for a 
picture ID. 

T h e 'uspect return d 
wi thou t the money and 
demanded that his ' lD be 
ret urned. A scuffle nsued and 
the cab dri ver was allegedly 
assau lt ed \ ith a "sharp 

EL LEWIS 

ins trument." The suspect 
rIed , bul Watson kept the ID 
a nd then called Campu s 
Police. 

Wa tso n wa s a pp a rentl y 
unaware t hat he had been 
injured until he felt 'ome pain 
in hi ' back and saw t he blood . 
When the police arri ved , they 
called paramedics and Wat son 
was taken to cripp ' Hospital 
where he underwent surgery. 
Currentl y, he is no grave 
danger but is s till suffering 
some pa m. 

T he police report they ha ve 
reason to believe tha t the 
suspec t later boarded a 
Grevound bus IXJUnd for the 
Los 'Angles area. They stopped

The Intramural Referee 
A look from the players J standpoint 

By LAnny GOLDMAN 
swrr \\ ' '';l l·r 

Thejobofintrwnural referee may be olleofthe 
mOST demauding)obs on c;ampus. On the field he 
has to deaf If ith the wrath of p lay el-s while trying 
to keep all interest ill a game that In igh I be boring 
or uhere he is actually IIOt wallted. He must be 
alert at all times and is rarely rell'ardedforajob 
If ell done. 

How do iutramural participants (players) feel 
about illlramural refs! What is tlte job of the ref 
like according 10 the refs themselz'es? What 
Iraiuing (10 the refs go through and whal do Ihe 
1M directors feel about 1M refereeing? These 
questions will be ansl{'ered ill Ihree successive 
articles begiJlllillg today with Ihe /)!ayers' l'ieU's. 

During a game, competition runs high with elllotion b.:cause 
intramurals are one of t he few release~ for studcnt~' 
fru"t rat ions. I f one asked a player w hat he felt a bou t t he ref" 
\\ hik' that player \\ as on a losing ..,ide, in most GI..,es the onl~' 
printable reslXlIlse would be. "they SLick!"

Three on three netters 
finalize fall quarter 

BY VALERI S. ANDERS 
Slaff Writer 

Intramural three on three 
men' s basketball playoffs take 
place this Sunday in the main 
gym beginning at 6:00 p.m. 
This weekend's tournament 
will be single elimination, the 
first team sconng 11 points 
winning the game. 

Although the hopes of many 
teams ended la t weekend in 
the first pha e of elimination, 
the top 20 teams are st ill in the 
running and competition is 
expected to be tough in all 4 
divisions . 

In triple A competition, 
defending champs "SWAMP" 
and defending AAA fiveon five 
champs "Spread, Penetratl' 
and Shoot" will no doubt be 
strong contenders. But a third 
team, "Magic" has aspirations 
of taking it all. 

This is the first year that the 
team " Magic" ha' played 
loget her, but captain Al 
Winters says his team "has a 
chance to win ." and if athletic 
abilit y is any indication he 
may be right. 

In AA action leam s 
"Physicians," and "On the 
Rebound " are among those 
with winning ideas. "Physi· 
cian, " were 13· L on the year, 
and captain orman Knight 

claims that if hi entire team 
show up there will be " no 
competition ." Compo ed of 
three staff members, one grad 
student and a freshman, the 
team chose their name because 
of their abi li ty to "operate" on 
the court. "At full strength I 
think we're the team to beat." 
said Knight. 

Craig Kreeger, captam of 
"On the Rebound" expects his 
team to do well too. Kreeger, 
along with teammate Greg 
Fuss , have played together for 
three years in five on fi ve 
basketball. G reg's brother Eric 
joined the group thi fall that 
has thus far proved to be a 
winning combination, 

The s ingle A team 
"Grogans" look to have the 
edge in their divis ion, but both 
"See Men Shoot," and "String 
of Pearl s" ha ve st rong 
possibilities as well. 

Captain of "Stri ng of 
Pearls" Lenard hulman 
hope. hi. team can "generate 
some heat early" citing the 
fact that three on three uses 
the "winners outs" ru le. 

This weekend's tournament 
will end three on three 
competition for this year and 
next quarter five on five will 
take its place.

UCSD runs in the Baja 
BY MIKE STEVENS 

For those of you who have 
never witnessed the Baja 
·1000, you probably won't 
understand what the 
whole event is about but 
that doesn't matter. If you 
enjoy lots of action. 
radically fast cars and 
motorcycles, then the Baja 
1000 is custom made for 
you, 

The entire town of 
Ensenada Mexico trans· 
forms into a mass celebra· 
tion and a giant pit area as 
teams are frantically 
making final adjustments 
on their machine and test 
running them through the 
city streets. 

This internationall y 
famous race draws partici· 
pants from as far away a 
Europe and East Africa , 
The 805 mile cour e winds 
its way through Baja 
California, where racing 
elevations vary from sea 
level to lO,()()() feet. 

Thi s year UCSD 's 
medical school conducted 
an experiment by connect· 
ing Glen Coss of San Diego 
up to a life sign recording 
device to record his body 
stress levels. Glen, a former 
heart attack victim. 
wondered what effect the 
racing would have on his 
heart. Being a fourteen year 
racing veteren , Glen knew 
that the course could take 
its toll on racers as well as 
machines. Riding with his 
cardiac therapist from 
University Hospital, Glenn 
finished the race 13th in his 
class. The data from this 
experiment will be used to 
better understa nd the 
relationship between stress 
and heart failure. 

For those of yo u 
interested in seeing a major 
motorcycle race, you still 
have one chance left this 
year. Saturday, San Diego

totally unique maneuver, he 
~eemed to thrust out his

and I hen bring them forward 
In an ersatz butterfly stroke

Heferees get paid $5.:~ an 
hour and pla~ rs felt that the 
refs who pul out in a game 
were worl hit bu I I h . ones \\' ho 
just "kicked back" were not. 
The main sugges t ion players 
have to improve the quality of 
refereei ng is to add more refs, 
for example have 3 r fs for 
each foot ball game. 

The general opinion was 
that mos t r fs don't dcser\'e 
t he abuse they r ceive 
(a lthough "ome d',,). On the 
whole, the players talked to 
realized that it takes a lot of 
experience to become a good 
ref and I hal cxpectal ions of 
them should nut be too high

What is it that 's so "pecial 
about Ihis horse? According to 
owners Bob and Vivian 
Farrringlon , who donate 10 
percent of Willie's earnings to 
th . Church of Chri'>t in W 'st
