Illegal alien tuition 
bill proposed 
UCSD administration sup-
ports AB-S40's changes 
By LARA MOSCRIP 
Senior Staff Writer 

The California Slate Assembly 
passed a measure Sept. 14 that, if 
approved by Gov. Gray Davis, will 
make going to college more afford-
able for illegal aliens living in 
California. 

Introduced in February 2001 by 
Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh 
(D-South Gate), Measure AB-540 
seeks to allow students wi thout 
legal California residency to pay in-
state tuition fees. 

Although a si milar measure 
was vetoed by Davis last year, the 
measure's proponents hope that 
the Texas legislature's deci ion to 
adopt the basic tenets of AB-540 
will lead to its success in 
Cali fornia. 

The measure would only affect 
tuition paid to community college 
systems and the California State 
University system, but UCSD Vice 

Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph Watson believes that the 
mea ure's approval could be a call 
for the University of California and 
its regents to follow suit. 

"If thi bill was adopted and 
signed by Davis, it would be a 
strong recommendation to the 
Regents of California to implement 
this program," Watson sa id . 

Wat on said that AB-540 
brings up a concern far greater 
than the money that s tudents, 
regardless of citizenship, would 
have to pay at California's public 
universities. 

He views the measure as a form 
of "public policy" and believes that 
it addresses the broader concern uf 
how inclusive California will be to 
its newest members. 

Watson said thal the measure 
could have a "great impact on how 
we view ourselves as a society in

IR/pS forum addresses attacks 

Former Mexican president over-
saw political, economic changes 
By LAUREN I. CGARTNEY 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Institute of the Americas 
honored Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de 
Leon, former president of Mexico, 
with its Award for Democracy and 
Peace on Sept. 21 at the Hotel del 
Coronado. 

The institute, the mission of 
which is to promote economic 
development and integration for 
the people in the Americas, selected 
ZedillqJor his role in the success of 
Mexico's democracy. 

"Ernesto Zedillo carried out an 
exemplary reform and moderniza-
tion of Mexico's electoral laws and 
process, and oversaw their full and 
faithful implementation," reads the 
resolution penned by the institute's 
board of directors. 

The directors also cited his work 
in protecting Mexico's economic sta-
bility during his administration and 
his orderly transfer of power at the 
end of his term as reasons for his 
selection. 

Zedillo, who served as Mexico's 
president from 1994 to 2000, reluc-
tantly accepted the award. 

"lb be honest, I don't like to be 
recognized," Zedillo said. "I don't 
like prizes. I don't like awards." 

Zedillo spoke about what he 
thought to be his insignificant incli-
vidua l influence in Mexico's political 
success and recent terrorist attacks 
on Mexico's sister country, the 
United States, as reasons why he ini-
tially tried to avoid being recognized.

Hundreds attend to gain perspective of local experts 
By GEOFF DlmlCH 
Associate News Editor 

On Sept 17., panel of local 
experts on international relations 
and American politics addressed 
a capacity audience on issues 
about the terrorist attacks on the 
World Trade Center and 
Pentagon. 

About 300 members of the 
UCSD community attended the 
town hall meeting, hosted by the 
Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies, 
looking for answers about past 
events and future action. 

"What we have to offer is how 
the United States positions itself 
in the world and how it moves 
forward," said interim IR/PS 
Dean Andrew MacIntyre, who 
mediated the meeting. "I think 
that is what people are increasing-
ly starting to wrestle with as we 
start to move beyond the first 
reactions of shock, disbelief,

anguish and grief." 
Many came to discuss concerns 

about the increasing likelihood of 
war. 

"I'm concerned that we will 
have an overly aggressive retalia-
tion on our part and end lip 
slaughtering millions of people," 

audience member Lance Rodgen 
said. "I came out here to educate 
myself about this global crisis. I 
feel like I am uninformed ." 

For some, the attacks on the 
East Coast hit close to home. The

Forum: 
Experts gave opinions 
on terrorist actions 
Continued from page 1 
meeting was intended to add per-
spective to the siruation. 

"I worked on the I07th floor of 
the World Trade Center and 1 lost 
some friends," audience member 
Peter Baravsi said. "Now we will 
hear a perspective from those who, 
while removed geographically, have 
an area of expertise that is at the 
center of the issue." 

Others just wanted reassurance 
that everything would work out. 

"I was hoping I would fee l bet-
ter after learning a little about the 
conflict from the experts," aui:li-
ence member Kirstin Mulvihill 
said . 

The panel consisted of profes-
sors from IRlPS, UCSD and 'San 
Diego tate University. 

Miles Kahler of IRIPS spoke of 
using military force witl1 discretion 
due to the fact that the impending 
battles will not be ones akin to 
other major wars. 

"Territory plays a very little role 
for Ithe terrorists I," Kahler said. 
"Their organizations are not hier-
archical. Their resources come 
from many difficult-lo-trace 
sources. 

"I would not say it is a new 
world ," Kahler said. "It's a world 
that has been in some being for a 
long time, but now we must recog-
nize it." 

Former deputy assistant secre-
tary in the Bureau of East Asian and 
Pacific Affairs for the State 
Department and current IRIPS 
professor Susan Shirk said that for 
the United States to successfully 
combat terrorist organizations, it 
must have unusual allies. 

"This is not a moment to only 
cooperate with countries that are 
democracies and that havS! a clean 
record and human rights," Shirk 
said . "Building this coalition is 
going to be very difficult. It can't 
just be a U.S.- ATO effort. It has 
to involve Russia and China." 

Using the U .N. Security 
Council as a forum for building 
suppOrt is essential, Shirk said, 
referring to the Sept. 12 resolution 
as an example of a swift and unani-
mous agreement. 

SDSU terrorism srudies expert 
Dipak Gupta said he recognizes 
that internal political strife in 
many Middle Eastern countries 
contributes to terrorism. He said 
that calming mose problems is the 
key to stopping terrorism in the 
furure. 

The current pro-U.S. govern-
ment in Pakistan, according to 
Gupta, could easily fall to Ta li ban 
sympathizers if the siruation is not 
handled carefully. 

" It is very difficult to find a 
common ground and a common 
will that will not upset Ithe govern-
ment o~ Pakistan," Gupta said. 
"Pakistan is already being wracked 
by a tremendous amount of ethnic 
conflict . We need to think what it 
will do to Pakistan. We have to 
pursue the perpetrators, but at the 
same time we have to give [citizens 
of the Middle East] a stake in the 
outcome." 

Kahler echoed Gupta's senti-
ments. 

"If we cannot align ourselves 
with those forces in the region that 
are seeking change of a democratic 
and peaceful sort, then we are 
going to make a big mistake," he 
said. 

The panel agreed that reducing 
America's involvement in the 
Middle East will do little to prevent 
terrorist attacks. 

"There is no way that 
Americans can live with them-
selves in terms of what they con-
sider to be their minimum 
involvement in the world and Dot 
be at risk of breeding terrorism,· 
said Peter Cowhey, director of the 
Instirute on Global Conflict and

USSA opposes provision of 
Bush's anti-terrorist bill 

The United States Student Association, a lobbying 
group that UCSO's undergraduate body passed a 
measure to join, has voiced its opposition to a clause 
of President George W. Bush's administration's anti-
terrorist legislation. 

This bin would, according to the USSA, allow the 
attomey general or the secretary of education to gain 
access - without judicial OIIersiR!1t - to all college 
records of students suspected of involvement in ter-
rorism. 

Julia Beatty, the USSA national president, consid-
ers this an opportunity for racial profiling of students 
of Middle Eastem and South Asian descent 

President Bush himself has asked the American 
public not to discriminate against anyone because of 
eth(licity or religion. The USSA algUeS that this bill

UCSD fraternity raises over 
thousands for N.Y. firefighters 

UCSD's Pi Kappa Alpha fratemity raised over 
$3,100 at its Backdraft event Sept. 22, held at Sports 
City to aid the New York City firefighters in the relief 
efforts in the wake of the Sept. 1 1 attacks on the 
World Trade Center. 

All of the event's proceeds will go to the Fire 
Department of New York's Widows and Children's 
Fund. 

This money will travel to New York City with memo 
bers of the Del Mar Fire Department when they go to 
help the relief efforts next week. The money raised by 
the fratemity goes with over $20,000 raised by the 
Del Mar Fire Oepartment. 

The Del MilT Fire Department sent three firefight-
ers to the event. Sports City offered donations, and 
Kinko's Copies offered a discount for their services to 
the fratemity. 

Alzheimer's research consortium 
receives $54 million grant 

The National Institute on Aging has awarded $54 
million to a consortium of 83 centers continentwide 
to find improved treatments and assessment tools for 
Alzheimer's disease, which affects about 4 million 
Americans. 

The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study was 
formed in 1991 as a cooperative agreement between 
the NIA and UCSD. 

The UCSD School of Medicine's chair of the 
Department of Neurosciences Dr. Leon Thai is the 
program's director. 

The ADCS previously had a five.year grant of $27 
million. 

The 83 ADCS sites in the United States and 
Canada host dinical trials of new approaches to tleat-
ing and preventing Alzheimer's. 

In the last 10 years, 13 research protocols have 
taken place, some with positive results now in prac-
tice. 

Five new studies are planned for f1e neIIt five 
years.

of life and we are going to have to 
live with it." 

Yet Shirk argued that the 
United States cannot achieve "so 
low of a profile that it will not be 
vulnerable to terrorist threats." 

UCSD political science profes-
sor Samuel Popkin discussed 
President Bush 's dil emma of the 
short-term appeal of going after 
Osama bin Laden and his long-
rerm goal of eliminating terrorist 
attacks. 

"At a time like this, Americans 
have a very high resolve for a clear 
goal, and they 're thinking that 
elimi nating a single person, Osama 
bin Laden, and stopping terr~r are 
one and the same," Popkin said. 
"Of course, they are very differ-
ent." 

In terms of AmeriC1ln politics, 
Popkin said that the winners are 
likely to be moderates, because a 
lack of sympathy will be shown to 
extremists. 

Popkin noted that Bush 's deci-
sion to delay his immediate return 
to Washington on the day of the 
attacks is a signal of Bush's desire to 
prevail in the long term and not 
worry about his short-term image. 

Americans will have to sacrifice 
some privacy and other civil liber-
ties if the war against terrorism is to 
be won, Cowhey said. 

"It will be very important in 
whatever type of oversight we cre-
ate that we maintain mechanisms 
of democratic accountability," he 
said. "That is going to be one of 
the biggest challenges we will 
have to watch for in the coming 
weeks." 

After the town hall meeting, 
some in attendance said they felt 
reassured and more knowledgeable. 

"I really liked what 1 heard ," 
audience member Tyler Allen said. 
"I thought a lot of their answers 
made a lot of sense. I was 
impressed with the quality of the 
discussion. " 

The meeting was informative,

Zedillo: 
Leader reluctantly 
accepted award 
Continued from page 1 
sentiments," Zedillo said. "On the 
one hand, gratirude for receiving 
such an honor. On the other hand, 
mere is my strong belief that no 
contemporary Mexican, including 
me, deserves to be singled out with 
any special merit in the building of 
Mexico's current democracy." 

Zedillo said Mexico's democrat-
ic government is where it is 
because of many factors . 

" I believe that Mexico has 
achieved its democracy over a long 
timespan and not by virtue of the 
decisions and virrues of just a few 
individuals," Zedillo said. 

"Democracy in Mexico is not to 
me credit of any single person, 
group or political party, n he said. 
"It is not even to the credi t of any 
single generation." 

After the Sept. II attacks on the 
United States, Zedillo tried to call 
off the event, feeling that it was not 
a time for celebration. 

However, Paul Boeker, who is 
on me institute's board of directors, 
quoted a speech by President 
George W. Bush to Zedillo in 
which the U.S . president advised 
that people, although profoundly 
affected by the attacks, were to 
keep moving ahead. 

NEW 3 

Zedillo opted to demote the 
event's dress code and to cancel the 
dance that would have followed the 
award ceremony. 

Other speakers talked about the 
attacks in relation to the accom-
plishments mat Zedillo was being 
honored for that evening. 

"I think we have a great deal to 
thank Zedillo for, and to honor," 
said Jeffrey Davidow, the U.S. 
ambassador to Mexico. "We are 
certainly going through the worst 
period of our national existence . . . 
and if we look at how President 
Zedi llo handled multiple crises, I 
minle we can learn a great deal. 
When many people around him 
were suggesting, when he faced 
insurrection, mat the way to handle 
the problem was through great 
military force, he said, 'No. Force 
is unnecessary. A nation must uti -
lize force, but often there are other 
ways to deal with problems, 
smarter ways to deal with prob-
lems.' And he was right." 

Davidow and the night's other 
speaker, the instirute 's chairman of 
me board of directors William L. 
Friend, noted that Zedillo often 
did his best work when he said 
"no,"inruitively managing to keep 
inflation down and use force effec-
tively. 

Zedillo is the sixth person to 
receive the instirute's Award for 
Democracy since its creation in 
1987.

ASSESSINGhe 
PRICE of LIBERTY 

The United States must protect itself from terrorist attacks, but 
infringing upon civil liberty is a dangerous way to achieve security 

By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

I n times of national CrasiS, especially 
war, 3 lot of trite platitudes about the 
nobility of sacrifice are bandied about, as if 
pundits and politicians just discovered a 
dusty copy of "Bartlett's Quotations" on 
their office shelves. 

When a country battles abroad or is 
besieged, the reasoning goes, certain luxu-
ries to which we are accustomed must be . 
given up. Food may be rationed; travel 
ma}, be restricted; laws may be tightened ; 
and the allowance we take for granted in 

our society may be curtai led. 
Reviewing such circumstances in U .S. 

history is a long and redundant 
process. Obviously, they run the gamut 
from harmless inconveniences - for 
e1Cample, the unavailability of ladies' stock-
ings during World War II due to the need 
for nylon for parachutes - to gross abuses 
of human rights, such as the internment of 
nearly 120,000 Japanese-Americans during 
the same war. r t is the myriad offenses that 
occur somewhere in between these 
extremes that Americans must now con-
cern ourselves with. 

President George W. Bush and his 

advisers have made it quite clear that mili -
tary action is on the immediate horizon, 
and , have from the outset used the word 
"war" to prepare us for a protracted 
engagement. This will be no hit-and-run , 
dine-and-dash spurt of air strikes from 
which America emerges unaffected, 
unscathed. Indeed, waging a "war on ter-
rorism" at all is arguably unwinnable in the 
first place - but that's for another debate. 

With no clearly defined long-term 
goals for the lofty campaign, it's safest to 
assume the worst: We're in for a long and 
bumpy ride. Eradicating terrorism? Who 
decides who's a terrorist? How will we ever 

know if they're all gone? 
National leaders have lately been 

encouraging us to return to our normal 
lives as much as is possible. They remiRd 
us that the nature of the terrorist attack is 
to inspire fear, t~ disrupt a community's 
sense of itself and to cause chaos. They say 
that if we cannot move on and show our 
strength, then the terrorists have won. 

They would do well to remember these 
words when considering how to balance 
the demands of national security and the 
liberties we all value as Americans.

that reporting President George

might be a viable position. 

All the e thoughts were going

it wasn't a presidential vehicle that

In the aftermath of last week's 
terrorist acts comes another attack: 
a nationwide backlash against 
Muslims and people of Middle 
Eastern descent. 

Amid the political leadership's 
cries for unity and justice, the chil-
dren of Middle Eastern immi -
grants are feeling foreign in their 
own land. It is as if these people 
are somehow less "American" than 
their peers simply because they 
adhere to the tenets of Islam and 
are brown-skinned. 

As the child of Indian immi-
grants, J spent most of my life fee.1-
ing "American" because r was born 
and raised here. 

While I respected and held 
onto certain facets of Indian cul-
ture, I al 0 assimilated into what I 
consider a diverse and tolerant 
society. 

That is the main reason I am so 
shocked by the insensitivity some 
Americans have shown toward 
Muslims, and particularly people 
whom they perceive to be from the 
Middle East. 

These bigots compose only a 
small minority, but they still have 
the potential to cause catastrophic 
harm . 

Several recent incidents around 
the United States, including the 
murders of two men who appeared 
Middle Eastern to their attackers, 
highlight this fact.

Afghani descent, but in the past 
few weeks I have experienced what 
it feels like to be regarded with 
suspicion and disgust. 

On a recent outing with a few 
of my Iranian friend s, during 
which we were discussing the col-
lapse of the World Trade Center, 
an older man 

New York. Her parents are from 
India, not the Middle East. 

This antagonizing senti ment 
has also exhibited itself to me in 
the encounters of friends who feel 
alienated by the hosti le glances of 
complete strangers. 

Even when I attended a memo-
rial vigil - which 

leaned over to say, 
"You guys should 
have been the 
ones to die in 
there ." 

Hindsight pro-
vided me with a 
few witty replies, 
but at the time I 
was too shocked 
and dismayed to 
say anything. 

I just stared at 
him, open-
mouthed. I was 
Aabbergasted by 
how anyone could 
say something so 
cruel. 

It was not just 
that incident that 
showed me that a 

On a recent

man leaned over 
to say, 'You guys

into expressions of 
anger aga inst 
"enemies of 
America" - I had 
to leave because of 
the quizzical 
glances from peo-
ple whose eyes all 
asked the same 
thing: "Why are 
you here?" 

As much as I 
try to blend in, my 
dark skin and my 
ethnic background 
prevent me froll1 
doing so. 

I feel strange 
being made to 
think I dOll't 
belong in the 

large, public anti-Muslim and anti-
Middle Eastern sentiment is grow-
ing. 

It is experiences such as that of 
my cousin, who works in a large 
New York law firm. A co-worker 
asked her, "What is wrong with 
your people?" 

My cousin, incidentally, was 
born in the United States and 
spent most of her chil dhood in 

country in which I have spent my 
enlire life. 

I could drape myself in an 
American flag, cover my car with 
red, white and blue, but none of 
this would erase tbe suspicious 
lnisconceptions others have of me. 
ironically, people would think I 
have more to hide.

liberties and opportunities the 
United States has to share. 

But what I have experienced 
recently has made me second -
guess the truth of our country's 
pride in having created a natiun 
with "liberty and justice for all." 

I don't want to bclieve that 
these words are hollow, espeCiall y 
at a time when national solidarity 
is most important. 

I certai nly don't want to think 
that Illy neighbors, my peers and 
even my landlord see me as less 
American than they arc . 

I believe that most Americans 
know the difference between a ter-
rorist and a law-abiding citizen. I 
hope it's just the ignorant few who 
want to get the Muslims and 
"Nabs" out of this country. 

Nevertheless, I believe that as 
the nited States prepares for the 
possibility of war with fghani , tan 
and any other nation aiding Osama 
bin Laden , there is a greater need 
for tolerance and unity. 

I don 't want the terrorists to 
have been successful in destroy-
ing both thousands of lives and 
our notion of securi ty, a well as 
fra cturing the United States fro ll1 
the inside. That will o nly create 
an e nvironment in ' which 
Americam are pitted against olle 
another. 

It may not be time for a m:lss

Government policies harm rave and club scene 
Law enforcement bends law to its whim and antagonizes dance event organizers 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Opinion Editor 

In 13)' 200 I, rwo events spaced 
10 days apart effectively framed the 
starus of the U.S. government' 
attitude toward the burgeoni ng

gal drug use, overdoses and the 
owners' operation of tbe club with-

On .\1a r 17, the U .. govern-
ment rcached a plea agreement 
WIth New Orleans rave promoters 
Robert and Brian Brunet, who h.ad 

been prosecuted under the obscure 
federal "crack house law." T his was 
the first instance in which the law 
was applied to a concert venue -
the State Palace Theater in New 
Orleans, where the defendants 
were promoting a rave. Its applica-
tion targeted the promoters of 
events where illegal drug use may 
have occurred, the determination 
for which was made from an assess -
ment of the presence of items such 
as pacifiers and glow sticks.

going strong for at least two years,

organizers at every

rurbing government trend: As the 
rave and club scene has grown 
more popular in the United States, 

the government has responded to 
what it perceives as a threat with 
the use of strong-armed and often 
questionable legal tactics. 

The government's insistence 
that it continue to fight its fruitless 
"War on Drugs" has had conse-
quences for activities in the dance 
music communi ty that would not 
otherwise have been a concern. 

Government officials, eager to 
thwart even the po sibi li ty of cre-
ation of zones where drug use 
might occur, have persisted in shut-
ting down dance festivals and clubs. 
To throw a party has become a 
criminal activity: The law thwarts

Mindless patriotism

Continued from page 5

I don't really have a problem 
with people cutting me off. I do 
have a newly formed irritation with 
pseudo-patriots, though. 

My girlfriend and I were driving 
to Los Angeles, playing out-of-
state license. It is a game in which a 
spotter, upon seeing a license plate 
that is indeed from another state, 
yells the name of the sta te and then 
slams his fi st into the arm of the 
person sitting next to him. We sim-
plified the game to use only 
American flags . 

Don't play this game if you are 
the driver, especially if you plan on 
driving down long city streets 
where there is a flag on evety street 
light. You are in for a world of pain. 

I noticed the posters that some 
nice people had made and placed 
on every freeway overpass for a 
good 50 miles. My favorite slogan 
on these posters was, "A nation in 
pain is a nation united." 

Just what are the authors imply-
ing? Perhaps we should have a 
national tragedy every week. If we 
could line up the Oklahoma City 
bombing, Columbine, Pearl Harbor 
and the World Trade Center bomb-
ing all in the same week, we'd be 
super-united. We'd be the Super-
United States of America. 

One might say that I don't like 
flags because I have come to that 
point through conditioning, having 
made a psychological connection 
berween pain and flags. 

One might also say that I don't 
like flags because there are so many 
posers who think that by fishing 
out their nappy, Old Navy Fourth 
of July flag T-shirts and putting 
them on in the morning, they're 
better people. 

These are the same people who 
eat up the "5 percent of your pur-

Libertv: 
Ashcroft -d~ires to pass 
legislation without debate 
Continued from .,-,. 4 

Lawmakers will face tough 
calls in the upcoming weeks, 
months and years, and it all begins 
now, when they set the tenor for 
the continuing conflict and its 
ramifications on the home front . 

Although America moves 
toward an open-ended war, our 
civil liberties must be preserved at 
all costs. If we allow our freedom -
loving society to be altered, our 
democracy denigrated, then we 
have given the haters of the West 
exactly what they want. 

U.S. AttOrney General John 
Ashcroft has proposed a wide-
ranging package of legislation 
aimed at making it easier to bring 
terrorists to justice. The measures 
are collectively called the 
"Mobilization Against Terrorism 
Act," and Ashcroft has repeatedly 
expressed his desire to push them 
through Congress with minimal 
debate and no public hearings . 

While Ashcroft's intent is 
undoubtedly honorable and the 
immediacy surrounding threats to 
American citizens is pressing and 
very real, in the words of a terribly 
wise forefather, haste makes waste. 

It is better to ensure that legis-
lators and the American public are 
aware of the full ramifications of 
such laws than to charge ahead 
blindly and later be sruck with 
more than we bargained for. 
Public debate of the propo als is 
especially crucial when they 
potentially threate n the most 
important underpinnings of our 
society and government. 

The measures to be debated ' 
vaty in their scope from expan-
sions of surveillance abi li ties for 
law enforcement to allowances for 
opening what were once matters 
of private record. 

Ashcroft argues that because of 
the nature of terrorism, and the 
essentially different means by 
which it is organized and execut-
ed, the government must keep up 
with the times and exploit all pos-
sible lines of investigation. Some 

of the provisions are a concern; 
some are not. 

One of the better aspects of the 
act is the revision of the nation's 
wiretap policy. Currently, investi-
gators must obtain a judge'S 
approval for a wiretap for a specif-
ic phone number, and the review 
process is not an easy one, involv-
ing a high degree of evidence and 
justification for the wiretap. 
Investigators must prove not only 
that the suspect is, indeed, likely 
involved ·in illegal acts, but that 
the suspect uses the phone line to 
be tapped to conduct the unto-
ward business. 

Fifty years ago, when a crimi-
nal might only use one phone 
number to telephone associates 

It is better to ensure 
that legislators and 

the American public 
are aware of the full 
ramifications of such 
laws than to charge 

ahead blindly and 
later be stuck with 

more than we 
bargained for. 

and accessories, such a review 
process was acceptable. ow, 
however, it is easy for a criminal to 
maintain several wireless accounts 
at once, and switch phones and 
phone numbers on a regular, 
unpredictable basis, foiling wire-
tap efforts . 

Ashcroft has proposed that 
wiretaps now be targeted at an 
individual , and not any specific 
phone line associated with that 
individual , allowing investigators 
to adapt to the suspect's changing 
means of communication. The 
review process for the wiretap OK 
would sti ll be rigorous, and the 
rights of Americans would be pre-
served. 

An eyebrow-raising aspect of 
the measure is the power to access 
previously private educational 
records of suspected terrorists -

act, a "terrorist" is not only the 
suicide bomber or deranged mur-
derer, but also anyone who knows 
or should know that an organiza-
tion he supports in any way is a 
terrorist organization. 

Currently, the only persons 
able to access one's transcripts and 
other elements of education files 
are the individual in question and 
his parents. Consent from one or 
the other is required for investiga-
tors to view any such records. 

Obviously, information con-
tained in these files could provide 
relevant evidence in pursuing and 
identifying terrorists, especially in 
establishing that they had the 
know-how to craft a certain type 
of biological weapon or, say, fl y a 
certain kind of commercial airlin-
er. 

However, such a power also 
subjects the sensitive academic 
histories of Americans to prying 
eyes. Privacy is a fundamental 
right in this country, and one we 
should prize and defend. 

If the idea of federal investiga-
tors being able to check out sru-
dents' embarrassing O -chem 
grades isn't thrilling, consider 
instead one of the more upsetting 
provisions under the act. 

Americans are fortunate in that 
we have a well-regulated set of 
checks and balances within our 
legal system. These checks and 
balances les en the number of 
abuses that can be committed 
(obviously abuses sti ll occur, and 
it's safe to assume that plenty go 
unpunished). 

However, many other coun-
tries in our global community 
afford no such consideration to 
their ci tizens, and are not restrict-
ed from violating people's rights in 
order to apprehend suspects or 
gain information. 

Out of some sense of moral 
duty or common decency, it has 
been AnleriCll's policy not to use 
electronic surveillance informa-
tion gathered by foreign govern-
ments with methods that violate 
our Fourth Amendment protec-
tion against unreasonable search 
and seizure.

Club has been subject to similar

cessful "Movement" event, the 
administration clamped down on 
the club, limiting the number of 
people at any event and all but 
restricting attendees to UCSD 
students. 

Of course, those who have the 
most to lose in this battle are those 
caught in the rug-of-war berween 
the government and event organiz-
ers - the clubbers and ravers who 
populate events . 

Before its shut-

evidence that the 
promoters were 
allowing drug use 
in defiance of the 
law. 

After 2000's

agement had con-
tracted a pri va te

emergencies at the

at that conclusion 
is staggering. Once

The government's zeal in perse-
cuting dance culture will only 
result in more dangerou , expen-
sive and lower-quality events for 
the majority of clubgoers who truly 
love the music. 

Events are frequently canceled 
before they can even get off the 
ground due to government 
stonewalling. 

The cancellation of British 
club Cream's massive 
"Creamfields" events - one in 

ew York, one in Las Vegas - are 
believed to have come about in 
part due to the organizers' inabil-
ity to secure permits from para-

inside. According to some reports, 
the officers then allowed a Nrw

access to the ambulance before it 
could depart for the hospital. 

It 's sti ll unclear how much the 
government is going to be able to 
get away with in the realm of dance 
culture crackdowns. It appears that 
prosecutors are willing to take the 
most liberal- and perhaps uncon-
stitutional - view of the law to 
achieve their ends. 

Without education and vigilant 
resistance to these actions, those

One of the advantages of paper 
flags, however, is that I don't see

However, to accept informa-

doubt our government is well-
acquainted with which countries 
engage in such practices) is tanta-
mount to condoning the very 
behavior we have. prohibited on 
our home soil. We can't have our

expiration date of sorts, upon 
which the legislation must be re-
evaluated. If Congress then 
decides it is no longer necessary as 
we are no longer at war, they can 
simply let it expire. However, as 
stated above, the very nature of 
this "war on terrorism" is indefi-
nite, with no clear end in sight, 
and so we must carefully consider 
what could effectively become 
permanent legislation. 

Throughout the mounting 
discussion surrounding the 
Mobilization Against Terrorism 
Act, the act's proponents have 
consistently said they are dedicat-
ed to protecting Americans' civil 
liberties while ·acknowledging the 
sacrifices necessary in striving for

The American Civil Liberties 
Union identifies perhaps the most 
threatening provision under 
Ashcrofts act, which would greatly 
expand the government's power to 
detain and deport suspected terror-
ists without a legal hearing, or 
indeed evidence. 

Also, the time limit on detain-
ing suspected criminals, now 24 
hours, would be eliminated for 
those suspected of terrorism. 

This is a total rejection of the 
judicial standards for which this 
country has fought and is held up 
as a model among democratic 
nations. The ACLU's executive 

Juliette Kayyem, the director 
of a counterterrorism project at 
Harvard University, explained to 
Tht Bostun Globt, "Based on suspi-
cion and innuendo, people are

that the terrorists who attacked

Porn leads to violence 
against women 
FBI tatistics show that the use of visual 
images of sex contribute to serial murders 

COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
- Pornography is as hard to find at 
Texa A&M University as beer and 
pizza. It is everywhere: in dorm 
rooms, at Barnes & Noble 
Booksellers, on computers and at 
Blockbuster. Many people maintain 
a "boys will be boys" attitude tOward 
pornography. l1ley t1link it is natur-
al for guys to look at "dirty maga-
zines" and that no one is hurt in the 
process. These people are wrong. 

Pornography devalues human 
life and it is a direct contributOr to 
violence against women. 

Of 36 serial murderer inter-
viewed by the FBI in 1985, 81 per-
cent admitted to extensively using 
pornography. 

Pornography plays a major role 
in many violent offenses, particu-
larly those that are sex-related. 

[n ~ laboratory study, sociologist 
Diana Russell showed the desensi-
tizing effect pornography had on 
Bundy is common. Rus ell found 
that male college students "were 
more prone to accept commonly 
held conceptions like 'a woman real-
ly wants to be raped,' and 'yes means 
no,'" after being exposed to pornog-
raphy in which women were depict-
ed as enjoying rape. After repeated 
exposure for only two weeks, the 
college males "found the violent 
pornography to be less and less vio-
lent," and some subjects became 
increasingly aroused by the images . . 

Pornography often leads to vio-
lence because it devalues human 
life. It strips women of their human 

characteristics and leaves only two-
dimensional objects whose sole 
purposes are gratifying their users. 
The fantasies in which users 
indulge center around themselves 
and their desires. Men who use 
pornography eventually stop seeing 
the women in pornographic images 
as human. In this way, pornography 
works as a catalyst in propelling 
sexual and violent fantasies into 
reality. As women become less 
human, they become easier to use, 
leading, m some cases, to murder. 

There is the danger that those 
who u e relatively mild porn, like 
Playboy, will move on to more 
explicit pornography. This pro-
gression is common because of 
pornography's addictive nature. 

The Internet has made it possi-
ble to view limitless numbers of 
sexually and violently explicit 
images at any time, in any place, at 
no cost and with total anonymity. 

The United States needs to rec-
ogniz.e the dangers that pornogra-
phy poses to our country. Drunk on 
our own freedoms, we are more 
concerned with our perceived right 
to look a1: what we choose t1lan wi th 
the men rotting in addiction and 
the women suffering violence 
because of porn. If we do not take 
steps to remove it from our com-
munities , we will all pay the price 
together.

10 NEWS THE UCSD G UARDIAN MONDAY, SEPTIMBER 24, 2001 

UC shelves dual admissions Gov't eases loan deadlines 
for those affected by attac~s Tight state budget halts program to attract minorities 

BERKELEY, Calif. - A tight 
sta te budget has forced the 
Unive rsity of California to post-
pone a new program that would 
have expanded UC enrollment 
by att racting underrepresented 
minorities. 

The state is unable to pay the 
millions of dollars needed for 
new services that would have 
provided the backbone for the 
new UC program. 

The Dual Admissions 
Program would have guaranteed 
admis!>lon to qualified transfer 
students who graduated in the 
tOP 12 .5 percent of their high 
school class. 

The program, which the UC 
Board of Regents approved in 
July with much fanfare, will 
require applicants to attend com-
munity colleges and take UC-
transfe rable courses while main-
taining at least a C-plus average . 

Upon passing the req uire-
ments, students would be 
all owed to transfer to a UC 
school. 

The $2.5 million it would 
have cost per year for the first 
three years of the program was 
more than the California legisla-
ture was able to pay. 

"The economy in California 
is slowing down, and that is hav-
ing a dramatic impact on the 
state treasury,OO said Max 
Espi noza, an ai de to 
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas 
(D-M ission Hills), who intro-
duced the proposal. 

The shelved admissions policy 
would have provided a Web-
based tracking system ca ll ed 
Gateway, which would clearly 
identify the required courses for 
each communi ty coll ege. 

UC spokesperson Michael 

Reese said the Web site would 
have assisted transfer students 
through the common confusion 
of transferable courses. 

In addition, more counselors 
would have been made avai lable 
to students at community col-
leges. 

Espinoza said the economic 
and fiscal downturn that led to 
the state's lack of funds was 
caused by the energy crisis. 

"The events of Sept. II won't

help the [economic) situation," 
Espinoza said. 

However, Reese said that the 
program could receive funding in 
the future, possibly by next year. 
Officials will renew a call to fund 
the program by January 2002 . 

Espinoza criticized the delay 
in the program's implementation, 
challenging the state to prioritize 
a project that could increase the 
number of underrepresented 
minorities in UC schools. 

"Tn th e grand scheme of 
things, $2.5 million is not a lot of 
money for the university to 
absorb, given the diversity crisis 
that the regents created," 
Espinoza said, referring to the 

current ban on affi rmative 
action. 

"If they really care about 
diversity, they should find some 
resources," he said. 

TQ. dea l wi th the diversity 
di lemma, the UC system already 
has a policy of guaranteei ng 
admission to high school stu-
dents who graduate in the top-4 
percent of their class. 

The Dual Admissions 
Program was expected to encour-
age more under represented 
minorities to enroll at UC cam-
puses, a major reason for which 
the regents passed it. 

The proposal can potentially 
assist students who have limited 
financial resources since com-
munity colleges cost less than 
UC schools, Reese said . 

"[They can] go the communi-
ty college route either because 
they didn 't have the fi nances or 
didn't receive the academic 
background needed in high 
school, and yet show hi gh poten-
tial," Reese said. 

The proposal would have 
made thousands more California 
high school students eligjble for 
UC admission, wh ich raised 
some concern with regents who 
feared that the university would 
be unable to handle the influx. 

Meanwhi le, the regents 
·announced that they wi ll con-
vene a special meeting on Oct. 17 
at UC San Francisco. 

The originally scheduled 
meeting for Sept. 12 through 
Sept. 13 was canceled in the 
afrermath of the Sept. 11 terror-
ist attacks and the shutdown of 
airports .

AUSTIN, Texas - A collabo-

Department of Education and 
student loan providers wi ll help 
people affec ted by the Sept. 11 
attacks to reduce or suspend pay-
ments on federa l college loans 
until J an. 31 , 2002. 

T he initiative wi ll provide 
"financial relief during these 
extraordinary circumstances," said 
U .S. Secretary of Education Rod 
Paige. 

Loan default payments wi ll be 
put on hold immediately for people 
living in any of the

Students nationwide should sti ll 

take note of the relief because the 
initiative could sti ll indi rectly bene-
fi t them, said Henry Uri~k, assis-
tant director of the University of 
Texas' Office of Student Financial 
Se.rvices. 

"It could have rami fications for 
some of their family ... who were 
impacted by the tragedy," Urick 
said. "Students need to be aware of 
what options their relative may 
have." .

of the initiative focuses ·on New 
York, it will also extend to students 
affected by the attack on the 
Pentagon in Washington, D.C. 
Borrowers outside the disaster 
areas impacted by the attack will 
also receive relief, according to the 
Department of Education. 

The Department of Education 
loosely defined the requirements 
for eligibility as "sensitive to all the 
victims who have been affected, 
and that could exten d to many peo-
ple," said Jane Glickman, a 
Department of Education spokes-

they are eligible for this relief. 
"[We are) trying to get the word 

out, "Gliclcman said. "This is one 
area [borrowers] don 't need to 
worry about in the near future." 

The Department of Education 
is developing more ways of provid-
ing financial relief .for the victims 
and is also working on more pro-
posals to give greater deadline flex-
ibi lity for colleges in the New York 
area, Urick said.

Bill: 
Illegal aliens would pay 
in-state tuition rates 
Continued from pale 1 
California." 

The measure would require that 
undocumen ted students attend 
school for at least three yea rs and 
graduate from a California high 
school to be eligible to pay in-state 
tuition fees . 

Whi le Watson said he does not 
believe that the measure wi ll cause 
an increase in the number of 
underrepresen ted students at 
UCS D, he stressed that the mea-
sure could encourage students who 
would be otherwise unable to pur-
sue higher education. 

"The bill could have a great 
ability to motivate. individuals to 
achieve their goals due to the 
decreased money barrier," Watson 
said. 

According to Watson, the mea-
sure sends the message that 
California wants all of its residents 
to be able to fully participate in 
society. 

Watson also believes that 
despite die ·number of individuals 
affected by reduced tuition, the 
measure's power lies in its ability to 
"impact broader public policy." 

Watson acknowledges the 
arguments made by the measure's 
opponents, that AB-540 would 
allow immigrants illegally living in 
California to pay the same amount 
of tuition as Californians with 
established residency stanis. 

Watson said that the concerns 
of AB-540's opponents, chiefly 
that passing the measure could 
mean increased illegal immigra--
tion to California and a decrease 
in the general quality of educa-
tion, are not "i rratio nal argu-
nlen[s." 

"[AB-HO) is a risk, and like 

Q1'I(1\ TIIRN \ROllt-;D 

most laws, nothing is perfect." 
Watson said. 

Watson said he does not believe 
that the measure will remedy the 
problem of underrepresentation of 
minorities at UCSD. 

"This is not an affirmative 
action or diversity bill ," Watson 
said. "That is a false argument." 

According to Watson, the mea-
sure addresses how society should 
operate in order to make sure that 
all California residents are positive 
contributors to society. 

"The bi ll is supported by the 
Cali fo rn ia Student Aid 
Commission, who believes this is a 
worthwhile bil l," Watson said. 

Elizabeth Snyder, a Muir 
sophomore, believes that applying 
in-state tuition fees to undocu-
mented residents proposed by AB-
540 would be equitable. 

"I think that would be fair, just 
as long as they are allowed to then 
become legal citizens and to 
receive the same taxes as regular 
citizens do," Snyder said. "As long 
as [these students] are contribut-
ing to the general economy in 
some way, I think it would be 
OK." 

Mike Davis, a Warren sopho-
more, agrees with the measure's 
principle of inclusiveness and 
opportunity. 

"This bi ll makes sense," Davis 
said. "If these students have already 
gone kindergarten to 12th grade 
and the state has funded [itl. then 
they shouldn't be prevented from 
going to college. These aren't 
wealthy people and they probably 
can't afford to pay the out-of-state 
tuition." 

According to Vincent De Anda, 
director of the Financial Aid 
Office, UCSD cannot choose to 
waive out-of-state fees in either 
need or merit-based situations. 

In addition, De Anda said that 
UCSD cannot award need-based 
financial aid to illegal aliens.

"'" Leun&i""'-EXperts offer insi,ghts into developin,g war 

The media have been relentless in 
their coverage of the Sept. I I terrorist 
attacks on two of our country's most 
famous cities. 

Last week's incidents are not 
unique; other countries have been tar-
gets of terrorism as well . The result of 
the attack on the World Trade Center 
and the Pentagon, however, will put 
the fight against terrorism at the top of 
America's list of priorities. Experts and 
pundits have been weighing in on the 
subsequent events, and we at UCSO 
are forrunate to have many faculty 
members knowledgable in the field of 
terrorism and international conflict. 

"We are now engaged in a coali-
tion, an effort to build an internation-
al fight against terrorism," said Susan 
Shirk, a professor of political science at 
UCSO's Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies. "It will help build a common 
ground between countries like China 
and Russia ." 

There have been solicitations for 
blood donations and funds (or relief . 
Shirk said she believes that it is now 
crucial to show tolerance and a sense 

of patriotism, one that does not target 
any specific group. In addition, she 
said, the United States should reach 
out internationally, particularly to 
countries such as Pakistan and China. 

However, UCSO political science 
professor Sanford Lakoff is skeptical 
about the effectiveness of an interna-
tional coalition and doubt~ the validity 
of U .S. Secretary of State Colin 
Powell's emphasis on diplomacy. 

Efforts to create an international 
coalition against terrorism are not 
new. They first began during the Gulf 
War, but dissolved soon afterward. 
Lakoff sees any attempts at creating a 
united force against terrorism as an 
illusion because many countries, such 
as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Syria, 
already support or are sympathetic to 
terrorists. Even France, with its histo-
ry of U.S. support, has assisted such 
individuals as Saddam Hussein, he 
said. 

"If we're concerned about getting 
terrorism, are we going to go after 
everybody?" Lakoff asked. 

He cited examples such as the 
Hamas Palestinian terrorist group in 

Saudi Arabia , which sponsors ac ts 
against 1sr3(, \. 

"I don't know what it means to 
declare war on terrorism .. . [or] 
whether it's practical," Lakoff said. 

Lakoff argued that descriptions of 
the terrorist attacks has been problem-
atic as well, particularly comparisons 
to the Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor. He acknowledges that in 
terms of casualties, last week's attack is 
unprecedented, but says that drawing 
analogies with the "date which will live 
in infamy" with what occurred on 
Sept. II is inaccurate. 

He explained that Pearl Harbor 
was a completely different situation 

. wherein one sovereign state attacked 
another, and that both sides were 
aware of who the enemy was and that 
future battles would result. Today, he 
continued, we do not know who the 
enemy is and it is not clear if this is, in 
fact, a war. 

Thus, Lakoff argues, President 
George w. Bush's description of the 
event as "the first war of the 21st cen-
tury" and similar rhetoric is deceptive. 
Lalc.off said that terrorism must be 

-",,. . L~t1\ T L~17 
L, : , ..J.. L-. j...Jj...J 

understood as a fOfm of low-i ntensity 
warfa re. 

"I think [politicians] are hoping 
that by talking this way, they'll bring a 
consciousness that this is a great cru-
sade and everyone should join in," 
Lakoff said . "In the absence of an 
operational plan, it is just feel-good 
propaganda." 

The government's response has 
been appropriate and Bush has shown 
good leadership and has a unified 
country supporting him, which makes 
the situation easier, Lakoff said . 

Lakoff claims that sustained retalia -
tion from the United States is also 
necessary, though the specific shape it 
will take is unclear . 

Yet the message should be clear. 
"We are not going to accept or sit 

passively by when there is terrorism 
against us Of our allies and friends," 
Lakoff said. "We've lost symbols of 
strength but not the strength itself." 

He also said that Muslims need to 
recognize that there are fanatics in 
their midst. The question, according

'THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 

Though distant, attacks rekindle desire to help 
'Enonnous mess' fosters sense of powerlessness in face of determination 

By CLAIRE ., VANNmE 
Features Editor 

I have struggled for the past 
two weeks with an overwhelming 
sense of uselessness. 

Oh sure, there have been other 
emotions in reaction to the events 
of Sept. I I. 

I'm tired of hearing those 
events called "tragedies." That 
word seems somehow inadequate, 
although I can't imagine a word 
that bener describes it all. 
- I could rattle them off, from 

disbelief to outrage and, narurally, 
grief. The last has been largely 
repressed, because I know that if I 
allow myself to sink into sadness, 
I'll be paraly-ted. 

Not that I can do anything to 
help anyway. 

I'm a in debt that I can't give 
money ~s freely as I'd like. Five 
dollars in a fireman's boot is a nice 
gcsrure, but such tokens do noth-
Ing to calm my restlessness or allay 
my feeling of impotence. 

My time is also severely limit-
ed. 1 have a full load of classes. I 
work 20 hours per week. I have 
commitments at the Guardia11 and 
at KSDT. 

Despite tllis, I have nirted with 
the idea of packing up my car, fill-
ing up my gas tank and driving 
east for three days. I can see myself 
knee-deep in pieces of what once 
were impressive skyscrapers. I am 
covered in ash. I don't miss school 
or work or my baby sister. 
Committed, purposeful, useflll, r 
am atisfied. 

I· know perfectly well that r 
can'r drop everything and charge 

blindly into the wreckage, asking 
to be put to use. There are oth-
ers, though, who can do exactly 
that. Libby, a friend who lives in 
Boston, told me about two of her 
classmates who went to New 
York. 

Both students only had one 
class that day, which they opted to 
skip. They took 3 bus to lower 
Manhattan and dedicated the 
entire day helping to clean up the 
"enormous mess." 

"What they told me gave me 
goose bumps," Libby said. ""J:hey 
were let in through a back door, 
so to speak, and rode through the 
streets in the back of an Army 
van . App~rently, thousands of 
people stood on the street side 
waiting to help as well. 
Thousands. A lot of them had to 
wait all day and after waiting all 
day, many were turned away 
because there was too much 
help. But they were all still cheer-
ing on the volunteers and hout-
ing out love for America, waving 
flags, singing, etcetera." 

uch a tory is inspiring. 
Maybe I should take a lesson from 
those people in New York who, 
unable to physically assist, offered 
instead their love and support and 
accepted that this is what they 
could do. 

But I've never been one to sit 
on the sidelines. In case you could-
n't guess from the schedule I 
recounted above, I'm high energy. 
I have to be busy. 

At some point - and here I'm 
sure I'm going to sound fatuous 
and self-important, if r haven't 
already - I realiz.ed that 1 have 

been blessed by circumstance. 
I come from a great family who 

has given me !,rifts of good genes 
and a healthy attitude. They were 
sufficiently well-off to live in 
neighborhoods with fine schools, 
to feed me good food and give me 
interesting books to read. I am 
intelligent and inquisitive; I learn 
things quickly. 

Obviously I have myriad weak-
nesses, and I'm well aware of 
them. Just ask me about my ex-
boyfriends. But it is much more 
important to be aware of our 
strengths, to know what we 're 
good at, so that we can do tllose 
things for the betterment of our-
selves and our loved ones. 

I don't know when this started. 
I don't know when I started feeling 
like a part of the Collective, oblig-
ated to give of myself to help my 
fellow man. It's entirely possible 
that all this high-toned rhetoric is 
nothing more than a bid at renown 
and respect. I like to think 1 have 
purer motivations, of course, but 
there are some who claim altruism 
is an illusion, and they may be 
right. 

Whatever the reason, I have 
known for some time that I want 
to do more than live placidly in 
my ivory tower. Once, I wanted 
to do exactly tha t: work in acade-
mia as a professor in literature. 
While I don't detract from the 
importance of the amazing teach-
ers and researchers we have here 
at UCSD, and indeed at universi-
ties all over the world, I know 
now that's not the path for me. I 
couldn't be satisfied in that role, I 
think. 

This led me to decide to join 
the Peace Corps after graduation. 
I guess I'll be sent to some devel-
oping country, providing whatever 
service I'm able. It will be scary. 
My mother, I think, hasn't realized 
yet that I'm serious. Neither of us 
will hahdle separation well. But it's 
worth it to be cut off for a time 
from everything that is comfort-
able and safe. 

And after that - who know' 
It's all well and good to look 

forward to graduation, but that 
doesn't help the way I feel now. 

All of this has come to a head 
lately because of acts that have 
little direct effect on my life 
other than to force me to restruc-
ture the page of a college news-
paper. But I am connected to it 
nonetheless, if only by my own 
reflections. 

But here I am at this particular-
ly illustrious ivory tower, with the 
chance to at least develop some-
tlling that could be put to use. And 
so I am enrolled in independent 
study of Arabic this quarter, 
prompted by the FBI's annOWlce-
ment that they are sorely under-
staffed in fluent peakers of that 
language. 

And I can write for the 
Guardian. The pen is mightier 
than the sword, right? I don't 
think I believe that yet. 

I do believe, however, in the 
power that those people in ew 
York had , encouraging those 
luckier than they; I'm doing my 

, best to smile and cheer whenever 
possible. It gives me something 
to do.

nizes it and deals with It , or Jmt 
rationalizes it and spon,ors it. 

Lakoff also said he is appalled by 
recent hate crimes toward people of 
Middle Eastern descent. 

"It 's despicable and , hould nor 
be tolerated," he says. " It demeans 
the nobility of our sacrifice and Oll r

Valuable insight also comes 
from local activists, who bring dif-
ferent points of view than can be 
found in the halls of a university. 

Marrin Eder, the directo~ of

he is disappointed by how the

responded to recent events.

Local efforts help victims of terrorist attack 
San Diego organizations lend a hand in times of need 
By ELIZABETH WEBB 
Contributing Writer 

This month 's devastating ter-
rorist attacks may have hit hardest 
thuusands of mile away from San 
Diego, but pain and suffering has 
reached people across the nation 
and sparked a zealous local 
response. 

Organizations and individuals 
have united to show their support 
for fellow Americans and to do 
what they can to ease the shock. 
Local chapters of national organi-
zations such as the American Red 
Cross, the Liberty Fund, the 
Salvation Army and the 
Firefighters Relief Fund have all 
been involved in the effort to 
rebuild and recuperate. 

Many organizations, including 
the American Red Cross, reported 
monetary donations reaching into 
the millions. In addition to mone-
tary and blood donations, the Red 
Cross is also providing mental 
health care crisis counseling for 
any who feel they need it. Specially 
trained mental health workers 
have also been sent to New York 
and \Vashingron, D.C. to provide 
services to the vast numbers of 
witnesses and families of victims. 

The San Diego Red Cross has 
sent several volunteers to the 
attack sites. On Sept. II , local 
members of the Spiritual Care 
Aviation Incident Response 
awaited a military transport to 
New York to provide spiritual 
care. 

tributed with a minimum dona-
tion of SI . Again, all proceeds go 
to the Red Cross fund . Pins are 
available at Westfield shopping 
centers. 

760 KFMB has also displayed 
its American pride and patriotism 

Local radio and 
television stations 
have also made 
immense contribu-
tions. 

O n Sept. 22, 
radio station Star 
100.7 FM orga-
nized the "Human 
Flag 200 1," which 
6,000 people 
attended, forming 
the American flag 
to represent and 
remember the vic-
tims of the attacks. 

Radio station Star 
100.7 FM organized 

the 'Human Flag 
2001,' which 6,000 

people attended, 
forming the 

American flag to 
represent and 
remember the 
victims of the 

attacks. 

by giving away 
flags since 
Tuesday and set-
ting up informa-
tion hotlines for 
the c ity of San 
Diego. 

K F M B 
Channel 8 was 
also involved in 
the nationwide 
effort to benefi t 
relief and recov-
ery efforts. 
Channel 8 was 
one of four major 
television stations 

The event was 
held at Qualcomm Stadium at 7:30 
a.m. Photos of the event will be 
made into posters that will be sold 
for S5 on the Star Web si te. All 
proceeds from poster ales will 
benefit the American Red Cross 
Disaster Relief Fund. 

Star also helped create 
"Together We Stand" pins, di -

and at least 20 
other affiliated channels that 
simultaneously broadcast Sept. 21 
the "America, A Tribute to 
Heroes" telethon. The event was a 
collaboration by the networks and 
featured notable celebri ties and 
entertainers such as Tom Hanks 
and Julia Roberts. 

The San Diego Blood Bank has 

asked all eligible San Diegans to 
donate blood or money to aid its 
efforts to remember and assist the 
victims. T he blood bank also 
teamed with the San Diego 
County Credit Union to create a 
San Diego Blood Bank Visa card. 
For every 'purchase made on the 
special credit card a contribution 
will be made to the San Diego 
Blood Bank. 

The local chapter of the 
Salvation Army has also been 
heavily involved in recovery 
efforts. Nationwide, the Salvation 
Army has already collected SJ.6 
million III donations. The 
Salvation Army National 
Commander, Commissioner John 
Busby spoke about the organiza-
tion's response. 

"The Salvation Army has a cen-
ter of operation in nearly every 
city in this country and each is 
fully mobilized and on alert to 
help all affected by this act of ter-
ror both physically and emotional-
ly, now and in the days to come," 
Busby said. 

The Salvation Army is sending 
canteens to the former George Air 
Force Base in Victorville, Calif.,

Adivists: 
Middle East experience 
gives new perspective 
Continued from paJe 15 

short run it seems terribly effective, 
but in the long run you'll create an 
uncontrollable monster. We cannot 
extinguish the fires of hatred by 
throwing gasoline on the perpetra-
tors." 

When a country declares war, 
he explained, it starts by presuming 
the guilt of others. Consequently, it 
accepts often massive "collateral 
damage," or the bombing of inno-
cent civilian areas, because those 
areas might harbor terrorists. A war 
allows free-fire zones within a 
country, yet with each unwarranted 
death comes a new generation of 
children who will dedicate their 
lives to becoming il!ture terrorists. 

"Among the most dangerous 
times are when people are blinded 
by grief and patriotism against an 
enemy that is foreign, misunder-
stood, and who we generally view 
as having a barbaric religion," said 
Eder of the U.S. reaction. "So we 
raise the flag and th~ Bible to blind 
us from the pursuit of rational solu-
tions." 

The erosion of civi l liberties, 
the increased surveillance on all 
foreigners and dissemers, as well as 
h~te crimes ignited by patriotic zeal 
are among Eder's concerns. He is 
also critical of the Bush administra-
tion. 

"I have absolutely no faith in an 
individual who had hardly et foot 
out of this country prior to becom-
ing president," Eder said. "His 
understanding of the world is 
minuscule. " 

Stephanie Jennings, the presi-
dent of Activist San Diego whose 
husband is a professor of pediatrics 
at UCSD, shares a similar senti-
ment. 

"The media says [Middle 
Easterners) hate freedom, but that's 
not true," she says. "The pain and 
suffering that the Middle Eastern 
people have experienced is so enor-
mous and immense the average 
American has n~idea." 

Reports of Arabs celebrating en 
masse i!! the streets are exaggerat-
ed, according to Jennings. During 
the Gulf War she saw what she 
called "some of the most inhuman, 
ugly behavior" by ~ericans. 

In recalling what she says is the 
hypocrisy of. the United States, 
Jennings described a story about 
the mothers she met during her 
1997 stay in Iraq. According to her, 
U.S. forces poisoned Iraq's water 
supply, forcing many chil4ren to 
choose between starving or dying a 
slow, agonizing death. She also is 
quick to dispel notions popularized 
by U.S. media that Iraq is an all-
Islamic, primitive and barbaric 
country. 

Jennings is adamant about the 
United States finally recognizing 
its role in the suffering of Middle 
Eastern countries. She points out 
that Osama bin Laden was trained 
by the CIA. 

In response to arguments that 
she may be naive and unrealistic, 
Jerminp de~nded her position. 

"People call us activists 'utopi-
an' but the fact is that if we don't 
have a goal to go for - a more fair 
and just world - then what's the 
point of li~ if we can't improve and 
grow?" Jennings said. "People 
should consider a.JleW approach for 
the purpose of self-preservation 
because we are creating a very dan-
gerous world and the choices we 
make are going to affect us 20, 30 
yean from now." 

Undoubtedly, the months to 
come will bring America's leaden 
challenges to cope with and new 
situations to address. The analysis 
of activists and scholan alike will 
become a focal point as tensions 
increase and military escalation 
continues.

Community organizations

Continued from Pille 16 
which has been reopened to planes 
transporting supplies. Planes will 
also be carrying evacuees from dan· 
gerous cities. The Salvation Army 
will be serving two or three meals 
per day in New York and 
Washington. 

San Diego firefighters have also 
been doing what they can to help. 
Near fire stations throughout the 
county, local firefighters could be 
seen standing outside and on 
neighboring streetcorners, accept· 
ing donations in their rubber boots. 
Their locations were broadcast on 
several local radio stations, letting 
San Diegans know where they 
could contribute. 

The community has also had a 
deeply personal response to the 
events of Sept. 11 . Vigils have been 
held throughout San Diego, 
including here on campus, and cars 
and houses can be seen decorated 
with American flags to demonstrate 
national support. 

The community effort is a vital 
and important one. We as a nation 
cannot hope to fully recover and 
unify if local communities cannot 
strive for solidarity and American 
pride. 

San Diego has had one of the 
most impassioned responses where 
individual efforts have contributed 
to the cause to rebuild, recover and 
prove America's strength to the rest 
of the world.

Muir freshman 

"I was at home eating bn:akfast. My mom came 
in ... and said to my dad that terrible things are 
happening in the world. The 1V was then on 
all day, which is unusual in our house." 

"Perhaps more self-control to make it easier 
to get up in the morning." 

"I'm not telling you." 

"I read a lot, and 1 e-mail my friends from 
back home." 

"I think that we should be going through all the 
evidence and making sure that before we move, 
we know everything there is to know about 
what happened." 

"That would be last summer. I went to a 
Barenaked Ladies concert with my dad." 

"Probably my family. I'm very close to them 
and 1 haven't seen them in a week or so, and I 
really miss my sisters a lot." 

"I'm enjoying it so far. It's nice to be in a bigger 
town and a bigger state." 

"It gives the impression that violence is OK 
because it happens all the time in the entertain-
ment industry. It's fiction, but it makes people 
think that violence is an acceptable thing, 
which I don't think is okay." 

"I hope to do graduate work in the British 
Isles. 1 want to focus on Celtic anthropology 
and do field work out there."

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2001 

Because: 
Stereotypical image of 
female athletes is changing 
Continued from page 32 
alone sports. Now picture a female 
athlete who is not only better than 
a guy at sports, but one who does-
n't whine about a broken nail and 
can play through pain just like her 
male counterparts. That equals one 
big chunk of an ordinary man's 
pride. 

How did men deal with this 
onslaught of female athletes who 
proved themselves time and time 
again in their respective sports? 
They lashed out with accusations of 
not being feminine, of being unfit 
for marriage, and even of being les-
bians. It 's a typical male response to 
!Omething that we don 't under-
stand. I'm not proud of it, but it 
happens. 

One would think that after the 
women 's movement swept through 
the nation and fought for equal 
rights that a woman who played 
sports could finally be viewed as a 
lady and an athlete, but that wasn't 
the case. 

Granted, it was becoming more 
and more acceptable for women to 
compete in athletics. Professional 
women's sports leagues began to 
spring up well into the I 990s, but 
female athletes were still not com-
pletely viewed as women. They 
were athletes first . 

One of the classic examples of 
this separation of "desirable" 
women and female athletes came 
from one of the leading voices in 
spons during the 20th century, 
"Sports Illustrated" .. 

In its annual swimsuit addition, 
the magazine featured scores of gor-
geous models running around on 
beaches in skimpy outfits. However, 
it was not until 1997 that someone at 
"Sports Blustrated" had a great idea : 
Include female athletes in the issue. 

Actually, it was a single female 
athlete. While she wasn 't on the 
cover of the issue, Steffi Graf 
slipped into a bathing suit and 
made history as the first female ath-
le te to model for the Sports 
Illustrated swimsuit issue. 

With her skin gracing the pages 
of the nation's most hallowed 
sporting guide, it was suddenly all 
right to think of female athletes as 
sexual icons. The national public 
began to take notice of the bea uti -
ful female professional athletes that 
had seemingly sprung out of 
nowhere in this country. 

Women like pro beach volley-
ba ll player Gabrielle Reece started 
getting endorsements for beauty 
products, and even . a 12 -page 
spread in the January 200 I issue of 
"Playboy". After the U.S. national 
women's soccer team won the 
World Cup in 1999 in dramatic, 
topless fashion, Brandi Chastain 's 
sports bra was the center of every 
male's fantasy. International female 
athletes such as tennis' Anna 
Kournikova and Martina Hingis 
even have gotten a solid following 
from young men. 

It is fi nally acceptable for 
women to play sports and to be 
seen as women at the same time. 
Personally, 1 think its about time. 

These ladies go out there and 
work hard day in and day out on 
the athletic field to try to earn 
respect. When their day is over 
and they've iced down their latest 
nagging injury, they deserve to be 
able to slip into a dress and be 
wined and dined like any other 
woman. 

For all of you female Triton ath-
letes out there who don't have any-
one to take you out on the week-
ends, you can always stop by the 
GUIlrdilln sports office and talk to 
either Isaac or myself. By the looks 
of it though, you shouldn't have 
any problems finding date on your 
own . 

Keep up the good work Out on 
the field, ladies. The guys will treat 
you right when you get home, I 

• promise.

their [Cal State L.A.'s) gym and 
pulled it out with their hostile 
crowd." 

Also contributing to the Triton 
attack was Laura Santerre and 
Ashley Peterson, who each had 11 
kills. Peterson added six blocks for 
UCSD. 

In the other match, the Tritons 
overpowered CCAA-rival Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, which 
entered the contest at 1-3 in the 
CCAA and 1-9 overall. 

It was the first match that ei ther 
school had played since the ept. 11 
terrorist attacks led to the cancella-
tion of CCAA action for a week. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

McFarland had worried that it 
might be tough to focus his play-
ers for the game. 

"I was actually really worried 
about how th e players would 
respond to all of this," he said. "It 
was on everyone's minds. We 
talked about it a lot as a team and 
JUSt tried to move on and focus on 
the game. I was very impressed 
with the way we responded in this 
difficult time." 

After shaking off some early 
rust from not competing in over 
a week-and-a-half. UCSD gelled 
as a team and took it to the 
Toros. 

"This was a tough game for 
us," said Cal State Dominguez 
H ills head coach Ali Wood . 
"UCSD is always a consistent 
team. They are tough to beat. We 
have had a lo t of injuries early, so 
we haven't really had the chance 

to come together as a team. We 
are still immature." 

The Tritons took the first two 
games with final scores of 30- 16 
and 30- 12, respectively. 

"We had a good start," Ohta 
said. "We knew that it was going 
to be tough beca use we hadn't 
played in a while, but we picked up 
the energy and never got down on 
each other." 

Cal State Dominguez Hills 
attempted to make a run at 
UCSD's second team in the third 
game, but even the Tritons' sec-
ond team proved to be toO much 
for the Toros and they closed out a 
30-23 win . 

"The whole team came out 
strong," said fres hman outside hit-
ter Stacy Dunsmore. "We gOt the 
job done." 

The Tritons were led by 
Ohta's match-high 28 a sis ts, 

SPORT 23 

Santerre's match-high 11 kills, 
Ashley Peterson 's seven kill s and 
six kills apiece from Hentz and 
Dunsmore. 

Dunsmore added six digs , two 
service aces and a block to gain the 
attention of McFarland. 

"[Dunsmore) had a very good 
night," he said. "Her ball control 
was great and she was solid in all 
phases of the game." 

UCSD now begins a tough 
road trip that includes games at 
Grand Canyon Universiry, Cal 
Po ly Pomona, top- ranked 
California tate San Bernardino, 
Chico State and UC Davis. 

The Tritons will be hitting the 
road for the next five ga Illes

and UC Davis, and will be back In

first game. 
As with the first game, the 

Tritons mounted a comeback. 
This time it was led by the strong 
play of Kathleen Hentz, who 
would end up with game-highs of 
20 kills and seven blocks, and 
Ohta, whose game-high 48 assists 
would be the key to UCSD's 
comeback. 

Ohta also had eight kills in the 

match, unusual for a setter, by 
unexpectedly dinking the ball over 
the net on several occasions to sur-
prise the Golden Eagles' defend-
ers. 

"[Ohtal has a really good sense 
on when to drop that little shot 
over," McFarland said. "It really 
keeps the opposing team llff bal-
ance and opens up the rest of our 
offense. She did a good job of that 
tonight." 

The Tritons pulled within three 
at 24-21 before the Golden Eagles 
pulled out to a 26-21 advantage and 
looked to have the second game in 
their pockets. 

UCSD would not go down

quietly, as the fans fueled a come-
back that knotted the score at 27. 
The teams then traded points 
until Cal State L.A. was finally 
able to str.ing two in a row and 
take the second game by a final 
score of 32-30. 

McFarland was worrit!d about 
how his team would respond to the 
letdown. 

"We had a few missed opportu-
nities there," McFarland said. 
"Something like that can really 
turn a team down, but we hung in 
there. This game was like a roller 
coaster for us. It had its ups and 
downs." 

In the third game, the Tritons 

In c;lairemont at Clairemont S~uare Shopping Center, 
Clalremont Boulevard and Clalremont Mesa Drive 

took a quick 12-5 lead and never 
looked back. 

The crowd was fired up as 
UCSD grabbed the third game 30-
20. 

Down bur not out, the Golden 
Eagles fought back and managed 
to take the fourth game 30-23, 
tying the match at two games 
apiece and setting up the decisive 
fifth game. 

The Tritons took an early 7-3 
lead in the final game and looked to 
have things sewn up, but Cal State 
L.A. called a time-out and poised 
itself for one final push. 

After surrendering three unan-
swered points and watching its lead

dwindle to two at 8-6, UCSD again 
looked to the crowd for support. 
Again, the crowd responded by 
supplying the emotiona l energy. 

The 1ritons would not allow 
another point in the match as they 
gelled perfectly and took the final 
game 15-6, winning the match 
three games to two. 

According to McFarland, the 
crowd made all the difference. 

"The fan s were huge tOday, " he 
said. "They decided this match. 
They really kept our spirits up out 
there. I don 't know if we could 
have gone intO the fifth game in

Men's soccer 
woes continue 
Tritons fall to 1-5 in league 
after losing two last week 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men 's occer team 
conti nued to struggle last week 
when it dropped two more 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association matches. The team fell 
1-0 in each of the contests. 

The Tritons, who are 1-5 in 
the CCAA and 1-7 overall this 
year, began the week on the road 
with a match against unbeaten 
Sonoma State on cpt. 17 at 
Cossack Field. 

Things went awry for UC D 
early when Cossacks ' freshman 
Brandon Boone took a feed from 
midfie lder Robert Juhler and 
~)ounded home the eventual game-
winner. 

The opportunity was created by 
a steal at the midfield stripe by 

onoma State mid fie lder Chris 
Daly, who passed it to Juhlcr to set 
up the goal. 

The Tritons had a chance to get 
back into the game when Juhler 
was assessed a questionable red 
card just minutes after the goal, 
giving UCSD a one-man advan-
tage. 

The gift woul d not last very 
long, however, because T.riton 
Derek OrcharJ was given a red 
card less than a minute later for 
pushing Cossack Brian Coyne in 
the back. 

"That card on him UuhlerJ 
could have cost us big today and 

now we don't have him for the 
Seattle Pacific game," stated 
Sonoma State head coach Marcus 
Ziemer. "But everybody tepped it 
up. especially [Thomas1 Corwin at 
midfield, and we got the win." 

UCSD had twO opportunities 
late in the second half with shots 
from Sean ummcrs and Ali 
Managhebi, but Cossacks goal-
keeper Matt Bernard nagged them 
both to preserve the one-goal vic-
tory. 

ick Tarantino had five saves 
for the Tri tons. 

UCSD returned to RIMAC 
field cpt. 21 to host top-ranked 
California State University 
Dominguez Hi lls, who handed the 
Tritons their second one-goal loss 
of the week. 

T he only goal of the game came 
at the 77: 16 mark when Toros 
senior midfie lder and leading scor-
er Sean Lockhart pounded home a 
medium-range goal off of a Gabriel 
Valencia assist. 

Triton goalie Ryan Wei rich was 
otherwise phenomenal in the net 
for UCSD , collecting seven saves 
in the loss. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills' 
goalie needed to make only two 
saves in the game to earn the 
shutout. 

T he Tritons will return to 
action Sept. 28 against CCAA rival 
UC Davis. T he match begins at 
4:30 p.m. at Triton Soccer 
Stadium.

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2001 THE UCSD O UARDIAN 

Water polo barely beats Cal Baptist 
Tritons jump ahead early then hold on for victory 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Th~ UCSD men's water polo team, 
national runner-up last year and undefeated 
this year, added to its perfect record with a 
13- 11 victory over California Baptist 
University last Friday at Canyonview Pool. 

Cal Baptist, ranked 16th in the National 
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, fell 
behind early as UCSD jumped out to a 5- 1 
lead in the first quarter. 

By halftime, UCSD led 8-3 after posting 
three goals in the second quarter to the 
Lancers' two . 

The second half belonged to the Lancers, 
however, as they outSCOred the Tritons 4-3 in 
the third quarter to pull within 11 -7. 

"We got off to a fine start, but just didn't 
play well at all," said UCSD head coach 
Dermy Harper. "[The playersl did not have 
respect for Cal Baptist." 

Cal Baptist owned the fourth quarter, 
putting up four goals to UCSD's two, but it 
was too little too late and the Tri tons held on 
for the victory. 

"It was a crappily played game aga.inst a 
highly motivated Cal Baptist team," Harper 
said. "They are just not maintai ning thei r 
focUs for one hour. But there are lessons to 
be learned from all of this. " 

According to Harper, the Tri ton's rela-
tively weak opponents this year have hun 
UCSD more than they have helped. 

"We've got to play teams that are 
stronger than \1S," he aid . "[Alsol it never 
helps when all we've done is play in San 
Diego: 

The Tritons' stellar season last year also 
has worked against them this year, along 
with the loss of some key players. 

"Everybody brings their best game when 
they play UCSD," Harper said. 

"We've gOt a lot of new faces," he con-
tinued. "It's going to take awhile to devel-
op." 

The Tritons, ranked ninth in the NCAA, 
were led by Brett Allan, who scored four of 
UCSDs 13 goals. Matt Ellis, Brandon Borso 
and Jonathan Hopkins each added two goals 
apiece. 

Cal Baptist was led by George Phiripes, 
Man Berry and Ante Kunac, who each con-
tributed two goals for the Lancers. Get out A UCSD water polo player stops a shot during their impressive season last year.

b\\( PI .\I{ I. \I\:"\ 

A few days ago, a friend of mine 
asked me, upon 
learning I was 
gomg to a UCSD 
women's soccer 
game, if we had a 
good team. 

I gave him my be t, "You must 
be stupid or kidding me" look, but 
he just responded with a hapless 
shrug of his shoulders. 

I told him that the team won the 
national championship last year, 
and that it is o. I in the nation 
this year. I wondered how he could 
not know this stuff. 

But then I thought, "Ilow 
would he know this stum" He, like 
most people at UCSD, doesn't 
attend UCSD sporting events. 

This apathetic trend tOward 
UCSD ports di turbs me. I hear al l 
the time how UCSD isn't a big 
sports school, and how rnu ·h better 
sporting events are at other schools. 

Here 's a heads up for all the 
people who want the same sporting 
experience as say U LA: Try ac tu-
ally going to athletic event . Thke a 
group of friends, grab some drinks 
and food, and spend an hour or two 
watching our women 's soccer team 
kick ass, or watchi ng our men's 
water polo team dominate. 

\¥hat else do you have to do? 
Sit in your room IMing your 
friends all night, complaining that 
UCSD has no night life ' 

Try leaving your precious COln-
puters and watching a UCSD sport-
ing event. They can be lots of fun . 
Yell at the referees, scream at the 
opposing players or ju t go nuts. 

For all those who went last year, 
remember Spiri t Night? 
Remember the stands jam-packed 
wi th students from every college, 
the excitement of the fans, the 
excessive partying that took place 
before, afte r and during the game? 

Every basketball game could be 
like thar. Every soccer game could 
be like that. Every baseball game 
could be like that. Every UCSD 
athletic event could be like that. It 's 
like that at other schools, but it 's up 
to the students . 

It cou ld be so easy, too. Our 
games arefru to attend. Don't have 
enough money to get into that frat 
party? Grab your friends and take 
them to the game instead. 

It 's also a great way to meet peo-
ple. Go with your whole floor, or 
your entire apartment building. 
For all those alcoholics out there, if 
you 're smart enough, it would be 
very easy to bring a little liquid 
courage and celebrate each goa l, 
basket, run, whatever. Just don't be 
stupid enough to get caught. 

A lot of people say that since our 
program isn't Division I, it 's hard to 
get excited about UCSD sports . 
That\; bull . There are many small -
er colleges that sti ll have great 
sporting event atmospheres. At 
Chico State, a smaller college than 
UCSD located up in northern 
California, people barbecue and' 
party just past the center field wall. 

So stop making excuses, take a 
break from the books, grab a group 
of friends, invite that cute girl or guy 
that lives on your floor and check out 
a UCSD sporting event. 

And I' ll tell you what: As more 
and more people start going to the 
games, as opposing schools begin 
to dread UCSD fans, II Triton 
teams begin to gain more supports 
from the fans and uniftftities, 
Division I might not be 10 far Iway. 
Imagine having games ...- top 
Division I sports schools. . 

There's one other relSOI1 you 
should go to athletic events: Not 
only can our sports teams be fun to 
watch - they're good too.

Volleyball stays on top of CCAA 
Tritons pick up two victories last week to improve to 4-0 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

UCS O 's women's volleyball 
team capped off a strong week of 
Ca lifornia Collegiate Athl etic 
Associa tion action with a draniatic 
3 -2 home victory over defending 
CCAA champi on Cali fo rni a State 
University Los Angeles. 

Ea rli er in the week, the Tri tons 
dismantl ed Ca li fo rnia State 
University Domi nguez Hills 3-0 at 
RIMAC Arena. 

T he latest victory was a big one 
for 23rd- ranked UCS D, which is 4-

o in the CCAA and 9-2 overall, and 
who had never beaten the Golden 
Eagles. 

" [Beating Cal State L.A.] was a 
first for us," said Duncan 
McFarland, head Triton volleyball 
coach. "It was nice to get that one. 
I thought we showed great charac-
ter out there to stick with it and win 
in five games." 

T he Golden Eagles, who are 3-
2 in the CCAA and 5-7 overall, 
built a quick 8-3 lead over UCSD . 
Cal State L.A. led early on thanks 
to junior setter Kristy Sain, who 
racked up a team-high 34 assists. 

and senior middle blocker Caryn 
Sale, who led the way for the 
Golden Eagles with 18 kills for the 
match. 

The Tritons trailed 20-13 
before picking up a big side out and 
forcing Cal State L.A. to call a time 
out as the large UCSO crowd 
began to get into the game. 

Feeding off the passionate 
crowd, the Tritons rallied behind 
the freshman sener Teresa Ohta's 
serve to pull within a point at 20-
19. 

UCSD finally pulled into a tie 
at 23 apiece before taking its first 

lead of the match at 24-23 . The 
Tritons would build a 26-24 lead, 
but the relentless Golden Eagles 
would not let the game go so eas-
ily. 

Cal State L.A. fought back to a 
28-28 tie and looked to have con-
trol of the next point, but UCSD 
scrapped its way though the 
exchange, diving for near-kills and 
keeping the ball alive before taking 
the point and the 29-28 lead . This 
brought the crowd roaring to life, 
giving the Tritons the energy nec-
essary to take the next point and 
the first game 30-28. 

Women's soccer beats Dominguez 
Tritons rough up 
the Taros in an 
extremely physi-
cal game 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

T he UCSD women's soccer team took on 
CalifornIa State University Dominguez H ills 
on Sept. 21 at Tri ton Soccer Stadium for its 
first home game of the season. 

On Sept. 22, 2000, the UCS O women 's 
soccer team played agai nst Dominguez Hills 
and lost 3- 1. T he loss was the Tritons' last of 
the season as they went on to win 22 straight 
games and the Division II national champi-
onshi p. 

Almost exactly a year later, the Tritons 
squared off against the Toros just a few days 
after their firs t loss of this season against San 
Francisco State and pulled off a convinci ng 3-
o victo ry against a strong Dominguez Hills 
team. 

"After getting beat last yea r at their place, 
it feels good to do it to them this year," said 
Triton head coach Brian McManus. 

Playing in their fi rst home game, the 
Tritons were forced to make do without senior 
defender Ju lia Cuder, who was ill and unable 
to play. 

Cuder's absence fo rced McManus to move 
several players out of their normal spots to fill 
her position. H owever, tlle Tri tons adjusted 
J1Icel y and played exccllent defense against the 
-Ioru ' . 

;\1clther team scorcd in the fi rst half, 
though they both had excel lent opportun i-
ties. 

AIded by their superior passing ski ll s, the 
Tritom controlled the ball for most of the first 
half and penetra ted deep into Toro terri tory 
but were IInable to take advantage. 

With 18: 15 left in the first ha lf, sopho-
more Kristin Jones made a beautiful pass to 
senior Erika Alfredson, who headed the ball 
toward the net. T he ba ll appeared to pass the 
goal li ne befo re Toro goa lie Heather 
Williams stopped it bu t the referees ruled it a 
save. 

Dominguez Hills had several o pportunities 
as well. Toro Tanya Wilson had a breakaway 
run on the outside but was unable to do any-
thing wi th it. About a minute later, Wilson 
had anothcr opportun ity to score off a cross 
pass but was stopped by Triton goalie Kami 
Poma. 

In the fi rst half, the Tritons appeared to 
have trouble wi th the very physical 
Dominguez Hills team.

because 
I said so 

T· This one goes out to all of the gorgeous females of UCSD athletics. You know 
what I'm talking about. 

I was watching our women 's 
vo lleyball team dismantle 
California State University 
Dominguez Hills last week when I 
noticed something that I hadn 't 
before . Our female athletes are 
very attractive. 

The more I thought about it, 
the more I realized that the phe-
nomenon was not limited to vol -
leyball, but included all of the 
women's sports at UCSD. Now, it 
wasn't that these girls were unat-
tractive before, but I just didn't 
think about it until last week. 

My complete overlooking of the 
hotness factor of our female ath-
letes led me to think' about the way 
that female athletes are viewed in 
society. It wasn't until very recently 
that a female playing sports could 
be considered a sexual icon. T hat 
role was traditionally left up to the 
glamour industry of models and 
actresses. It has only been in the 
past few years that a female ath lete 
could be viewed as both an athlete 
and a woman instead of simply a 
tomboy who plays sports. 

This had to do with the fact that 
it was JUSt not acceptable for 
women to play sports prior to 
1980. It was not considered lady-
like. Along with society'S condem-
nation of a woman 's role in sports 
came a stereotype about the 
women who played sports. 

This stereotype was that they 
were manly, rough, cmde and unfit 
for any "respectable" man. Some 
people went as far as to deem female 
athletes lesbians. That stereotype 
lives on today in the assumption 
that the majority of women on the 
pro golf tour are lesbians. 

Another reason that female ath-
letes were not- viewed as sexual 
icons in our society is that' men 
were simply afraid of them. 1 don't 
mean that they were cowering in 
the corner and sucking their 
thumbs, but they were intimidated 
by the existence of women who 
were actually athletes. 

Men hate to admit that a girl 
can beat them at anything, let
