Protesters Disrupt Regents Meeting 
CONTENnON: Board 

~pproves budget, 
hospital merger 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Protesters disrupted last week's 
UC Board of Regents meeting sev-
eraltimes, although the regents still 
managed to approve the university's 
$6.7 billion 1997-98 budget and the 
pending UCSF-Stanford hospital 
merger. 

The largest protest erupted Thurs-

day, when the board prepared to 
vote on the univcr ity 's proposed 
1997-98 operation and capital im-
provements budgets. 

Approximately 50 students, some 
from UCSD, stood clapping and 
chanti ng slogans i ncludi ng "No uni-
versity without diversity ," "Defy 
209" and "Whose university? Our 
univer ity ." 

UC police declared the protest 
an unlawful assembly after several 
minute and ordered the students to 
leave. The students filed out peace-
ably and there were no arrests . 

CONGRATULATIONS! 

The regent only approved the 
expenditure portion of the budget.

$330 general fee increase and $40 
technology fee until Gov. Pete Wil-
son announces the state budget in

rees may go up even if the legis la-
ture supplies the neces ary $33 mil -

According to UC President Ri-
chard Atkinson, raising faculty sala-
ries to the level of comparable insti -
tutions is the university 's top prior-
ity - higher than maintaining stu-
denl fees at their current levels. The 
raises alone would require $16.9 
million above the $136 million in-
crease guaranteed by the compact. 

According to UC Budget Direc-
tor Larry Hershman, the fee increase 
is required under the governor's 
Compact with Higher Education. For 
the last two years, the state legisla-
ture has provided additional funds 
to "buyout" the increase - al -

Sentencing 
Delayed For 
Another Week 
REVERSAL: Ernest Lee 
admits guilt to court after 
months of denial 
By Terry Lew 
News EdItor 

Former UCSD staff member Ernest Lee 's 
sentencing was delayed another week last Fri-
day, when San Diego Superior Court Judge 
William Kennedy said he wanted - in light of 
Lee's sudden admi ~ion or guilt - more time to 
consider Lee's psychological evaluation before 
making a dec ision. 

Lee, who had consistently maintained hi s 
innocence until now, wrote a letter to Kennedy 
on ov. 5 to admit hi s guilt and "accept full y my

Regents Approve Proposed UCSD Gene Therapy Center 
VECTORS: German 
pharmaceutical giant is 
partner in new center 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents last 
week gave its blessing to the cre-
ation of a new gene therapy research 
and manufacturing center, in part-
nership with the American subsid-
iary of a German pharmaceutical 
firm . 

Gene therapy involves targeting 
diseased cells with specially engi-

neered genes, carried by viral or 
non-viral agents called vectors -
"healing from within rather than 
cutting from without ," according 1O 
UCSD Chancellor Robert Dyne .... 

The idea of isolating particular 
genes and using them therapeuti -
cally was first introduced in 1972 by 
Dr. Theodore Friedmann, now di-
rector of UCSD's Human Gene 
Therapy Program. 

The UCSD School of Medicine 
currently operates a similar facility 
for UCSD researchers and selected 
third parties, but it is in danger of 
closing without increased capital and 

marketing ~upport. 
The new facility, to be known as 

the Molecular Diagno tics and 
Therapeullcs Center, will bejointly 
owned and operated by UCSD and 
the Boehringer Mannheim Corpo-
ration (BMC) - a S600-million 
company headquartered in Indiana. 

BMC's parent company, 
Boehringer Mannheim, is a pri -
vately-held, $4 billion German phar-
maceutical company. Boehringer 
Mannheim is currently establishing 
a similar molecular-medicine ser-
vice center at San Raffaele Hospital 
in Milan, Italy, and has proposed 

establishing additional centers 111 
other corners of the world. 

The new venture will allow BMC 
10 gain a foothold in the rapidly 
evolving field of molecular medi -
cine, as well a access to UCSD's 
scientists and clinical research pro-
grams. UCSD scientists would also 
have a significant advantage in 
bringing their invention to market. 

"Boehringer Mannheim shares 
the same vision as UCSD regarding 
molecular med 'cine, and gene 
therapy in pacticular," Dynes aid.

REGENTS: 
Some say merger is 
needed for survival 
ContInued from pace 1 
gent Jess Bravin opposed both the 
increase and the new fee. 

"We have a duty LO provide a 
tuition-free education to California 
residents," said Bravin, who also 
took issue with the significant pay 
raises granted this year to several 
high-ranking UC administrators. 

"To me, if we have the money 
it's unconscionable to ask students 
to bear the price of these pay raises." 
he said. 

Davis, who suggested linking fee 
increases to growth in ramily in-
comes. warned the regents not to 
" bleed every last dime out of stu-
dents." 

"The university. for all its great 
qualities, is not student- friendly ," 
he said. " We ought not look at stu-
dents as cash cows." 

However, Atkinson defended the 
instructional- technology fee -
which is expected to increase incre-
mentally over a four-year period to 
$200 per year. 

"This is the key to the future, and 
the UC has to be atthc leading edge 

of that future," he said. 
The university is expecting the 

state to provide $4 million in match-
ing funds for instructional technol-
ogy. which is also above the amount 
cal/ed for in the eompacl. 

The most contentious protests of 
the meeting concerned not fees but 
hospital services. The first demon-
stration took place on Wednesday. 
after the regents' Commillee on 
Health Services voted 9-0 to ap-
prove the UCSF-Stanford merger. 
A dozen protesters. many from the 
University Professional and Tech-
nical Employee (UPTE) union. then 
auempted to push their way to the 
regent ' table at the front of the 
auditorium. 

After being pushed baek by UC 
police officer, several of the pro-
testers sat in the aisle and rerused to 
get up. Others yelled "Shame" and 
"Arrest the regents," and at least 
two were carried out when police 
finally broke up the demon tration. 
Six people were arrested for failure 
to disperse, and all were cited and 
relea ed. 

" This is our medical center, not 
theirs," UPTE representative Libby 
Sayre shouted. "They can't give it 
away." 

The protesters passed out

for "derrauding the taxpaying citi -

The fliers accused the regents of 
transferring university medical cen-
ters and other public assets to pri-
vate entities. defrauding consum-
ers, endangering patient safety. mi s-
appropriat ing state funds and "aban-
doning the historic mission of aca-

Several union members. i nelud-
ing American Federation of State and 
County Municipal Employees repre-
sentative Linda Kahn, addressed the 
regents during the public comment 
period before the meeting. 

"You shouldn't be privatizing 
public health care." Kahn said. 
"We're watching ... [but) if you 
didn't listen the first time, [ doubt 
you're listening to me now." 

UCSD neurosurgery department 
chair Charles Wilson, who said he 
changed his opinion after examin-
ing venture -capitalist Warren 
Hellman's third-party review of the 
merger. was one of very few outside 
speakers to support the proposal.

" ] would not ask you to suppOrt

the best interests of UCSF and the

Atkinson rcaffirnled his support 
for the merger, and told the regents 
they must act now if they hope to 
save UCSF. 

''There comes a time in the lifeor 
every enterprise when itillust go out 
and actively meet it s future, instead 
of waiting for the future to happen. 
That is where UC San Francisco 
finds itself today." Atkinson said. 
"There are uncertainti es and ri ks in 
the decis ion to proceed. but a deci -
sion not 10 proceed involves far

William Kerr cautioned the regents 
that. "the decision you make today 
will determine the future of UCSF' s

the medical center could not survive 
much longer if the merger failed. 

" I firmly believe that this merger 
is the only way to'sustain our pre-

he said. 

The full board voted 14-2 on 
Friday to approve the merger. The

~IIIIIIIIIII~ thing about the rejection of 217 

Besides being in complete 
denial of exactly who benefits 
from government funding, the 
anti-tax attitude goes completely 
against the democratic ideals it 
claims to represent. If we truly 
believe in the ideal of representa· 
tive democracy, we must recognize 
our responsibility as citizens to 
participate in the process, not only 
by staying informed and voicing 
our opinions through voting, but 
also by doing our part (0 make sure 
our government has the financial 
strength to achieve society's goals. 
We all have a certain responsibility 
to make some kind of monetary 
sacrifice for the good of the whole. 

This minority is the rich. 
The idea that the rich need 

defending may seem surprising. 
They are, after all, doing quite well 
for themselves. But they arc the 
victims of a variety of negative 
stereotypes, many of which play 
well with the majority of the elcc-
torate and form the basis of much 
public policy. They arc constantly 
accused of not paying their fair 
share, of not dcserving the money 
thcy have and of not contributing 
to society. All these charges are 
groundless. 

Myth II: The rich don't pay 
their fair share. 

These words arc chanted like a 
mantra every time someone willis 
to increase taxes on the wealthy. It 
is, of course, difficult to argue with 
fairness, but a look at the numbell 

from defense and law 
enforcement, they get min-
imal benefit from welfare, 
public housing, public edu-
cation and the many other 
social programs that make 
up most of government 
expenditures. The people 
paying the vast majority of 
tues get very lillie in return 
for it. It's true that the rich do 
not pay their fair share -
they pay far more than their 
fair share. 

Myth 12: The rich do not 
deserve so much money. 

This idea is based on the 
image of the idle rich, living 

See WEALTH, Page 6 

EARN MORE. PAY MORE 

is that it is ba ed on a mentality 
of greed and class-alienation -
greed in the sense that rich peo-~~~, pie don't think that they have a ~ responsibility to help anyone but 

~d";l <it 
RIIldy Reynolds/Gu.m1I.tn <!> 

themselves; class-alienation in the 
idea that government spending 
benefits only the poor and the 
undeserving in our society. 

Everyone loves to blame every-
one else for where their tax money 
is going. "I\ 's not the government 
programs that I benefit from that 
are bankrupting the government. 
Someone else is benefiting from 
programs that waste tax dollars," 
we say to ourselves. But the truth 
of the matter is, all of us benefit 
from valuable social programs, 
and there's nothing wrong with 
thaI. We simply need to recognize 
that everyone must pay his or her 
fair share. 

Today's political climate is very 
much anri-tax, but how can we 
expec;tto benefit from government 
services without each of us paying 
our fair share? How can people 

expect their garbage to 

~ be collected, their . ncighborhood playground to be 
.. built or their Social 

Security benefits to be paid 
without adequate funding? 

This is the reasoning behind 
progressive taxation : sacri fice . 
According to the 1996 World 
Almanac, in 1995, a single person 
with an income level of $255,000 a 
year fell into the highest federal 
tax bracket - a bracket with a top 
rate of 36 percent. Now this extra-
ordinarily rich person did not pay a 
36 percent tall on all his earnings, 
but consider if he or she had. That 
person would have sacrificed 
$91,800 a year in order to support 
all the benefits of our government: 
Social Security, national defense, 
environmental protection 
everything. While this person may 
look like he or she is sacrificing a 
lot, he or she was still left with 
$163,200 - an amount most 
UCSD graduates will take a span 
of several years to earn. The point 
is that this person does not need all 
the $255,000 he or she earned. He 
or she can gel along just fine with 
$163,200. 

While there is a diversity of 
such scenarios, an individual in 
such a situation is really only sac·

PROPOSITION 209 PROTESTS ARE NOT 'LAWLESS' 
Editor: 

- I 
I 
I 
I 

Regarding your cditorial 
"Lawless Protests Are Poor 
Responses to Prop. 209" 
(Guardian, Nov. 14): By definition, 
"civi l di obedience" is ' the con-
sciou choice 10 violate civi l law in 
order to remai n true to a higher 
moral call. ['m curious - would 
you describe the sit-ins and protest 
marches that characterized the 
Civil Rights movement as a "sense-
less disruption of the public 
peace"? 

You may not find Propo ition 
209 to be morally objectionable, 
but those who do may consider it 
their moral responsibility 10 speak 
out in ways that others think are 
disruptive. Simply saying that they 
weren't engaging in civil disobedi -
ence doesn ' t make it so. 

The purpose of civil disobedi-
ence is to point out the immorality 
of an action or law. To belittle uch 
action as "mere lawlessness" belies 
not only mean-spiritedness, but a 
dangerous ignorance of history.

Campus Should 
Respect Strike 
Editor: 

Regarding your editorial 
"Graduate Student Union Should 
Vote No on Strike" (Guardian, Oct. 
31): TAs have taught me to read, 
wrile and think critically. TAs have 
taught me to speak a foreign lan-
guage. TAs continue to provide me 
with the basic skills that I need to 
complete my major. And for their 
dedication to my education, often 
going beyond the call of duty, 
spending hours with my papers, 
discussing my questions , and shar-
ing their resources, lowe them an 
incredible debt.

The ASElUAW is not simply 
asking for more money. The 
ASElUAW is not simply asking for 

more privileges. The ASElUAW is 
not simply trying 10 enrich them-
selves at the expense of the under-
graduates through this strike. 

However, whal the ASElUAW 
i aski ng for is simple: the recogni -
lion and the respect that they 
deserve as employees of Ihe uni-
versity. This request has been 
denied for too long, and unfortu-
nately must now be demanded. 

The disruption of classes this 
week will emphasize the important 
role that TAs, readers, in tructors 
and tutors play in making this uni-
versity a succes ful institulion of 
higher learni ng. 

I urge my fellow tudents 10 
honor the mike, for our education 
depends upon the. working condi-
tions of the student employees. I 
urge the faculty of UCSD to honor 
the strike, for the quality of the uni-
versity depend upon the qualily of 
the work of TAs, readers, instruc-
tors and tutors. Recognition of the 
graduate-student union is long 
overdue.

Graduate Strike 
Hurts Students 
Editor: 

It is oUlrageou~ that the gradu-
ate student TAs would choose 10 go 
on stri ke at such a critical puin! in 
the academic quarter. Due to I he 
timing of the strike and its conjunc-
tion with the Thanksgiving hrcak. 
they are effectively slriking fortwo 
week ' instead of just one. 

Unfortunately for undergradu-
ates, graduale siudents feel that a 
strike is the on ly way to improvc 
their working conditi ns. However. 
the si mple fact of the mailer is that 
graduate students arc sufferi ng 
from a surplus in the market for 
student labor. 

Graduate students should con-
sider alternate ways to see that their 
demands are met, such as withhold-
ing student grades at the end of the 
quarter. This week's strike will 
only jeopardize students' learning 
- a goal the graduate students 
claim is still their main obje~tivc.

6 OPINION 

WEALTH: 
Aff1uent people earn 
money the hard way 
Continued from page 4 
off the money they inherited from 
parents who wcrc thcm selves idle· 
rich inheritors. This model may 
work in some parts of the world, 
but it fail s mi erably in the United 
States. 

According to "-orbe.r maga· 
zinc's list of the richest people in 
the United States, the top six start· 
ed from scratch and made their 
own money, as did 18 of the top 25 
and 44 of the top 57. Of the 13 who 
inherited their wealth, all but two 
have taken an active role in main· 
taining and building on it. 

Inherited wealth docs not last. It 
is dispersed among an ever-grow· 
ing pool of heir's and attacked by 
steep estate taxes. Every member 
of the Forbes 50 who inherited his 
or her wealth is the spouse or child 
of thc person who originally made 
it,. with the sole exception of the 
heirs to the Levi-Strauss fortune. 

FAIRNESS: 
The rich should 
share their wealth 
Continued from pce 4 
rifking luxuries: one less new car, 
one less remodeled room, one less 
extended cruise. Whatever hap· 
pens, he or she has enough money 
nOI nnly to survive comfortably 
bUI to pay for a large amount of 
luxuries. 

A single person on an income of 
$10,000 a year, on the other hand, 
sacrifices, at the outside, $1,500 a 

Most of the great names of the 
recent past - Morgan, Chase, 
Huntington - are nowhere to be 
found among today 's wealthiest 
people. People generally become 
ri 'h by making their own money. 

Some argue that, even if the 
money has been earned, the quan· 
tities are out of proportion. But the 
imple fact is that the rich beeome 

rich because they are the most pro· 
ductive members of society. The 
free market rewards people 
according to their ability to pro· 
duce value, 

While some might question 
whether Bill Gates and Paul Allen 
deserve their $26 billion in com· 
bined wealth, the fact is that with· 
out them there would probably be 
no practical personal computers. If 
the market is not to decide the 
worth of a person's work, then who 
is? Who has the moral authority to 
override the free decisions of every 
buyer and seller in the world? The 
answer is no one, 

Myth #3: The rich contributc 
little to society, 

Wealthy individuals have 

year in federal taxes. Thai's a sub-
stantial amount for someone on 
such a limited income. and it does 
not even include state and local 
taxes. This may be a smaller dollar 
amount, but we can't ignore the 
fact that it is need'ed much more 
than the $91,000 or so another tax-
payer may sacrifice. ThaI money 
must pay for medical insurance, 
rent, transportation or any number 
of other necessary items that the 
poor may not be able to afford. 

It is only fair that those who 
make more money and can afford 
to help pay for the basic necessi·

a simple desire for fame or from a 
genuine desire to help, but either 
way society benefits. Many of our 
nation 's finest universities -
Duke, Stanford and Carnegie 
Mellon, for example - were 
founded by wealthy individuals. 
The same is true for many great

Ro s Perot has a copy of the 
Magna Carta. on loan to the 
National Archives. Wealthy people 
have endowed numerous fellow-
hips, pri zes and foundations that 

promote culture and learning: 
But philanthropy is not limited 

to promoting high culture. The 
UCSD library has been upported 
by Theodore and Audrey Geisel 
(also known as Dr. and Mr . 
Seuss). The new public library in 
Pacifi c Beach and UCSD's 
Institute of Geophysics and 
Planetary Phy ic were funded by 
Cecil and Ida Green. And you can 
hardly turn around in this city 
without bumping into something 
made possible by the Scripps fam-
ily's money. 

When it comes to the contribu -
tions of the rich to society, howev-
er, philanthropy is merely the 
gravy. It is their business activity 
that is the meat and potatoes. I 
wrote this article on a Hewlett-
Packard computer with an Intel 
processor, using Microsoft soft-
ware, wearing my Levi's and my 

who have less should be given 
what they need. 

While the marketplace may 
reward people with lots of money 
for services they provide or for 
products that they invent, rich 
people do not have an absolute 
right to keep everything that they 
earn. No one really deserves to 
earn milli9ns of dollars in one 
year. These people are where they 
are only because they got lucky. 
To paraphrase Rep. Richard 
Gephardt, the rich are rich only 
because they fared well in the lot-
tery of Ii f e.

Nikes. while munching a Snickers. 
I may not think about it all the 
time, but all of this was made pos-
sible by the members of the Forbes 
50. The rich are the rich because 
they are the most productive memo 
bers of society. They gain wealth 
as compensation for their upcrior 
abi lity to create value. 

Without Sam Walton Ihere 
would be no Wal-M art . Without 
the Mars family there would be no 
nougat. The rich take risks, build 
factorie , build stores and hire peo· 
pie. As columnist Bruce Madison 
asks, " When was the laSI time a 
poor person offered you ajob?" By 
making sound business decisions, 
the rich create wealth and increase 
the size of the economic pie. While 
their sli ce of this pie is large, there 
is more for everyone because of 
their actions. 

None of this is meant to imply 
that the rich are better than others 
in any way except for their ability 
to produce wealth. It is only meant 
10 make you think the next time 
you are tempted to blame the ills of 
society on the rich . 

While we bicker about how 
much ta>.es the rich pay, our gov· 
ernment gets further and' further 
into debt, our educational system 
lags further and further behind 
other countries' and our streets are 
more and more riddled with crime. 
Is the answer to our financial prob· 
lems to raise taxes on the poor? 
Certainly nol. Is it to lower every· 
one's taxes and hope thaI philan· 
thropic contributions from a few 
wealthy individuals will make 
everything better? Republican 
rhetoric not with landing, absolute· 
Iy not.

these glowing letters the truth, be-
cause to this point all he's told are 
lies," Koerber said. "I feel sorry 
for all the people he's dragged imo 
this." 

According to Kennedy, firsh 
degree burglary carries "presump-
tive prison time" of between two 
and six years per conviction. 

"The court has to be convinced 
there are unusual circum tance to 
allow you to be considered for 
probation," Kennedy said. "Some 
people don't ha ve much of a prob-
lem with that. but I do." 

Steigerwalt said he was con-
cerned Kennedy would reject the 
probation officer's recommenda-
tion , possi bly at Koerber's urging. 

"I think the judge is known for 
being a particu larly di fficult judge 
in terms of sentendng, in terms of 
criminal defendants," Steigerwalt 
said. "On the other hand. he' s a 
fair man, so I'm optimistic he' ll 
follow the recommendation of the 
probation officer." 

San Diego County Probation 
Officer Charlyne McKain recom-
mended that Lee serve one year in 
the county jail , pay a total of 
$1,281.95 in fines and restitution , 
and "be ordered into long-term 
psychological counseling" as a 
condition or hi probation.

The uni versity has no initial ca h 
obligation , but is supplying the 
center's facilities and a majority of 
the research behind it. The univer-
sity also has the option, at Atkinson 's 
discretion, to contribute up to 
$200,000 to the joint venture during 
its first three year . Largercontribu-
tions would require prior regental 
approval. 

Although its primary function is 
to support others' research, any new 
research creations will be owned by 
the new company. 

Boehringer Mannheim, BMC'$ 
parent company, will also give re-
search-support funds directly to the 
university . Anything developed by 
UC employees with such funds is 
the property of the regents, and 
Boehringer Mannheim will be al-
lowed to license the inventions from 
the university. 

However, Dynes said thecenter' s 
primary function is not to perform 
original re earch.

The new company will be gov-
erned by an eight-member board of 
directors - Dynes will sclectthree. 
BMC will select four, and the eighth 
will be a mutually agreed-upon 
presiden!. 

Six of the eight directors must 
approve decisions involving lines of 
business, additional capital contribu-
tions, personnel policy, possible con-
flicts ofintcrcsts, use ofthe university 
name and intercampus coordination. 

The initial length of the deal is 
expecieo to be 10 years, with either 
partner having the option to termi-
nate the relationship after five years 
or at any lime with just cause. The 
university will own 49-percent of 
the new company, and BMC will 
own the remaining 51 -percent. 

The plit was based on the con-
tributions each partner will make to 
the new venture, according to Uni -
versity Counsel representati ve Lloyd 
Lee. 

The accounting firm Ernst & 

EWS 9 

Young has appraised the uni versity 's 
contribution at approximately $3.8 
to $4.3 million. 

Although Regent Roy Brophy 
said he was com;erncd the 
university 'S non-majority share of 
the company could cause it to lose 
control of the venture. Lee sa id the 
split concerned only profits and that 
the required six-of-eight VOle would 
protect the university. 

"The 51 -percent does not give 
voting control ," Lee said. "It·s a 
partnership in which all the partners 
must agree." 

Dynes added that , "Busi ness de-
cisions have to be agreed upon by 
the supermajority. There is nothing 
in this that is not in accord with UC 
policy." 

Regen! Clair Burgener, who said 
he was very excited about the pro-
posal, gave it his full support. 

"I think the risk is very modest 
indeed," Burgener said. "It 's a ter-
rific combi nation of public and pri -
vatethat will benefit mankind, wom-
ankind, peoplekind in general."

ALTERNATE 

KSDT Challenges the 
N orlll by Airing an 
Eclectic Array of Music 

Turn on any of the popular "alternative" radio stations nowadays, and chances are slim that you will stumble upon any music 
you haven' t already heard a million times. 
That's because the big ones - like 91X, 
92.5 "The Flash" and Star 100.7 -
generally play the same three songs over 
and over again. othing against Garbage, 
No Doubt and the Smashing Pumpkins, 
but the song isn' t go ing to change 
whether its the fi rst time you hear it or the 
400th . Where do you tum the dial if you 
wan I some new music? 

KSDT, UCS D's student-run , non-
pro!il , volunteer radio station provides an 
alternati ve. Broadcasting from the murky 
depths of the Old Student Center, KSDT 
has been catering to San Diego's ears fo r 
nearly three decades, promoting local 
bands and playing an unmatched variety 
of music. It can be reach\.:d at 540 a.m. on 
most of the UCSD campus, and also is 
broadca t on 95.5 via outhwe~t Cable 

throughout San Diego . 
"There's a lot of music out there that 

isn 't available," Cable works General 
Manager Alex Thiesen said . "College 
radio gives a broad spectrum of music 10 
listen to, as opposed to 91 X, for 
example." 

While the big commercial networks 
tend to incessantly play only the 
designated singles from an album, KSDT 
strives for depth and variety. 

"Here we playa whole range of songs 
instead of just one song, so you can get a 
better idea of an album," said KSDT 
publicity director Cristyn Brown. 
"There's a lot more di versity of 
programming." 

Indeed, KSDT strive to accomplish 
something that no commercial radio giant 
would even dream of - they play a 
veritable grab-bag of music that appeals 
to the most eclectic tastes.

Are you all wearing significantly different things from last week?" With this, Marshall junior Chris Lightbody began taping an episode

Koala TV, a even-member comedy

of "locker room humor" and , according to 
Spencer Varas. became omewhat of a

when it began airing on UCSD's Student-
Run Television (SRTV). 

Contrary to popular belief, Koala TV 
is a separate entity from The Koala

WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF THE TA STRIKE? 
Interviews by Nandlnl Harlhar.eswara • Photography by Alii Macisaac 

Well , I think the TAs do 
a good job and are entitled 
to whatever money they 
can afford to be paid. I 
hope [the strike] doesn 't 

- cripple the teaching sys-
tem at this schooL if the 
strike is settled quickl y, 
then it will be fine, but if 
the strike isn't settled 
quickly, the TAs are out 
for more than a day or two, 
it will cripple the educa-
tional process here. 

Rick C •• ou 
Warren Junior 

I support it 10091, but I 
don 't have any Humanities 
classes, so it doesn't affect 
me but r still think it 's a 
good cause.

I Ihink the TAs do the 
brunt of the work at UCSD 
and they're nOI respecled . 
as a union. and consider-
ing the work that they do 
for the uni versity, and a lot 
of the teaching goes 
through them, they should 
be respected as a union. 
So, I support the strike.

Dieyo Charyers took I 
step back, losin! to 

the lowl, Tampa Ba, 
Buccaneers hy a score 

of 25-17 
. O K. so what if he was the fifth pick in the 1994 NFL draft, and so what if he set all kinds of passing 

record at Fresno State. Trent Dilfer has been ter-
rible as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback 
and is on the way oUI. .. ri ght? 

Not on Sunday. Just ask the San Diego Charg-
t:IS uefense. Bobby Ross' game plan seemed fool -
proof: run an eight-man front to stop Errict Rhett 
and Mike Alstott (the only real offensi ve threats). 
and let Di I fer pass the Bucs to another defeat. Thir-
ty completions and 327 yards later, Ross was .. 
scratching his head whileTony Dungy's team 
(which improved to 3-8) was celebrating a 25- 17 
come-from-behind victory. 

Early on. it looked like it was going to be 
another long, ugly day for the Bucs, as it only took 
the Chargers three plays to put their first touch-
down on the board. Wide receiver Charlie Jones 
caught a slant pass on third and three from Stan 
Humphries and turned it into a 63-yard touchdown 
romp. 

Tampa's kicker Matt Husted then added to the 
troubles when he missed a 33-yard field-goal 
attempt. The defense then forced San Diego to 
punt, but Marvin Marshall fumbled Darren Ben-
nett's offering and it was recovered on the Bucca-
neer's 12-yard line by the Chargers' Glen Young. 
On the next play, Leonard Russell rumbled in for 
the touchdown. 

Now up 14-0, the Chargers clearly had the 
momentum, and Jack Murphy Stadi um was rock-
ing. It looked as if the game was going to tum into 
a rout, but the Bucs didn't give up. Linebacker 
Derrick Brooks exemplified the Bucs attitude, 

"[when it was 14-0] ... we weren ' t thinking 
'Here we go again', we were just going to take it 
one play at a time," Brooks said. "And tight back 
one play at a time." 

That is exactly what Dilfer and the offense did 
in the next series. Behind Dilter 's accuracy, Tampa 
Bay again drove down the fie ld. This time, Husted 
convened a 33-yard tield-goal attempt. 

Later, Dungy cited this drive as the game's 
turning point . 

" ... The biggest thi 19 was being down by 14 and 
to get a drive and to get that confidence that we 
could move the ball ," Dungy said. 

In the second quarter, they finally cracked the 
end zone. Dilfer was the catalyst. demonstratirig

San Diego dropped a crucial 
game to lowly Tampa Bay 
Continued from paee 16 
why Sam Wyche drafted him, and why Dungy has 
kept him. He made great decisions, and threw the 
ball with surprising conlidence. Dilfer led Tampa 
on a long 6:20 drive that culminated with a 4-yard 
touchdown run by A·lstoll. By halftime, Tampa had 
added another Husted field goal, turning a possible 
rout into a 14- 13 ballgame. 

In the third quarter, Junior Seau and the Charg-
eraefense brought the Tampa Bay attack back to 
earth, shutting them oul. However, Hardy Nicker-
on and the Tampa Bay defense were up to the 

challenge, surrendering only a 42-yard John Car-
ney field goal. 

Then came a wild fourth quarter that saw the 
ball change hands eight times and two costly inter-
ceptions of passes by Humphries. The first change 
of possession came when Was Sunday one

Mitchell got one hand on of those quirky

game. After an incomplete 
pass by Humphries came the 
play that sank San Diego.

18-yard line. There, Dilfer made a clutcl! third-
down pass to wideout Connie Hawkins, who was 
taken down inside the one. Rhett rolled over the 
pile on the next play, pUlling the Bucs ahead 22-
17. 

The defense did stop the Bucs attempt at a two-
poin t conversion, leaving the door open for a 
comeback . With 6:02 left in the game, Humphries 
had plenty of time to redeem himse lf. This was 
clutch time for the Bolts. This was a test to see if 
thi s team has the heart that has lifted San Diego to 
big victories and the playoffs the last two years. 

They failed. The Bucs defense stopped Russell 
for a 3-yard gain, and forced a big third and seven. 
Humphries stepped up in the pocket, and for some 
reason threw 30 yards downfield for Tony Martin. 
It was broken up by Abraham and San Diego had 
to punl. At this point the boobirds of Jack Murphy 
came out and the tickle Chargers faithful flooded 
to the exi ts by the thousands. 

The timing could not have been worse for the 
Chargers, who came into Sunday's game with a 6-
4 record. A win would have put them at 7-4, and 
given them the inside track for one of the wild-
card pots. The loss drops them into a four-way ti c 
with Miami. Indianapolis and Houston for the last 
two spots, with Seatt le and Oakland sti ll not out of 
the race. Now at 6-5, the Chargers face a must-win 
game next week in Kansas City. and the Chiefs 
have only lost once thi s season in Arrowhead Sta-
dium. 

Was Sunday one of those quirky days when the 
usually abys mal Trent Dilfer comes through on 
countless third downs and Stan Humphries, one of 
the league 's bettcr signal ca llers, thrqws disastrous 
interceptions? Or was Sunday the beginning of a

No Joy in Mudville 
LAKES: After 36 straight hours of rain, the Tritons could not 
overcome the elements and Luther (]A), losing 1-0 in overtime 
By Nicole Varps 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

MinneSOla is known as the land of 10,(XX)Jakes. 
The UCSD men's soccer squad got a firSl-hand 
look at one of these lakes last Satwday. Unfortu-
nately, the lake at thetimc is usually used as a soccer 
field. You see, the Tritons were forced to play on a 
field soaked with twostraightdaysof rain. That was 
the situation the UCSD men's soccer team faced 
last Saturday in Minnesoca when they faced off 
against Luther(lA)in thefirSl round of the NCAA 
Division ill playoffs. 

The Tritons left San Diego earlier this week 
as the No. Iteam in the Western Region. Yes-
terday, they left SI. Paul with their final loss of 
the year, 1-0 in overtime. 

'The field was unplayable," said UCSD 
Assistant Coach Ted Przybylek. "No one trains 
for these types of conditions. Any ski lis the guys 
have are thrown out; no dribbling, no passing." 

MacalesterStadium resembledoneofthestate' s 
10,(0) lakes, after snow, rain and ice battered the 
field for over 36 hou~ straight. The Tritons, how-
ever,tried to overcome the adverse playing condi-
tions. UCSDtook 14shots,andlaunc~ I 4 comer 
kicks. Luther played much'the same. amassing 12 
shots on the goal but only five comer kicks. 

"We played awesome, but we couldn', put 
the ball in the net." Przybylek said. "I mean, 
scoring wasn't the easiest thing in the world to 
do, and the ball just wasn't going in." 

The Tritons were at top strength, with senior 
sweeper Joel Kosakoff and freshman mid fielder 
Cameron Adams returning to the starting line-
up after sustaining injuries in the team's last 
game against Division I UC Irvine,. 

Atthe end of regulation,the game was still 
scoreless and UCSD remained hopeful. Less 
than five minutes later, though, Todd Ancelet 
of Luther put a shot past freshman goalie 
Chrles levinson giving Luther the lead, 1-0. 
Despite having nearly 25 more minutes left in 
the overti me, the Tritons were unable to make 
up the deficit. 

UCSD finishe the season with a record of 
10-7-1 ,and looks to next year for anotherchance 
to make a tripto the nationals. That may be a feat 
in itself, with the Tritons losing eight senior 
players after this year. 

"We are losing a lot of seniors, but we have 
always been able to put up a competitive team, 
Przybylek said. "But we are losing a lot of 
players that are tough to replace. I cou ldn't be 
more proud of all of these guys." 

Ca" •• ,.' .,rll

Oh. to expound upon the virtues of 
La casal Bob and I celebrated his birthday 
with lunch at La Casa. and we made a 
fiesta of Itl We thouaht we were back in 
Acapulcol Bob had the quesadilla. a

Tritons Thrn Out the 
Lights on North Coast 
CWBBING: UCSD beat North Coast Aquatics, a local club 
team that includes some future Division [ swimmers 
By Adria McClain 
Staff Writer 

What began as a typical, temperate San 
Diego day quickly became a chi lly, No-
vember afternoon for the UCSD swim team 
this Saturday as they faced the North Coast 
Aquatics . 

The Triton swimmers donned their par-
kas and huddled together to cheer 
on their teammates as they swam 
against the contingent from up 
north . With the final race in the 
books and the points tabulated, 
both th e UCSD men's and 
women's teams emerged victori-
ous under the I ights at 
Canyon view Pool. 

"North Coas·t is a local age-
group team which has beaten us in the 
past. They have some future Division I 
swimmers and some very good one at 
that," Triton Head Coach Doug Boyd said. 

"Our team responded very well to the 
challenge," Boyd added. 

The women. who won with 67 points, 
had numerous impressive swims. 

"We had many good performances. It 
seems everyone swam fast today," de-
fending NCAA 200-yard breastroke cham-
pion Kelly Byrne said. 

Freshman Jamie Rubino took first place 
in the 200-yard fly with a blisteri ng time of 
2: 13.21, qualifying her for the NCAA 
Championship meet. Linda Monroe also 
ensured herse lf a spot in the Champion-

ship meet by placing second in the 400 
Indi vidua l Medley relay . Senior Shawna 
Caballero swam well, winning both the 50 
and I DO-yard freestyle events. 

The men, who scored 84 points to North 
Coast ' s 3S, also had a number of out- -~ 
standi ng performances. Scott Wiederhold 
won both the 200-yard and I OO-yard back-

strokes. Junior Tim McAteer also 
raced to multiple victories despite 
the chi lly conditions. He won the 
500-yard freestyle and the grueli ng 
1650-yard freestyle with a time of 
16:48.78 . 

Former Triton All-American Ed 
Ruth , who has returned to swim-
ming after a year off, won the 400-
yard Individual Medley with a time 

of 4: 19.2S. 
"[[ was a rough week of training, but 

days like today make it all worth it," Ruth 
said . 

The hard work doesn't stop there; the 
Tritons will conti nue to condition them-
selves in preparation for future meets and 
tougher tests. Many of the Triton swim-
mers wi II look to post NCA}\ quali fying 
marks. 

"We have a very hard week of training 
ahead of us and it will be interesting to see 
how [the team) respond: on Saturday," 
Head Coach Doug Boyd said. 

Cal State Uni versi ty Bakersfield will 
be in town this weekend to further test the 
Tritons.

;. ;Tlitons Stumble at NCAAs 
·DlSAPPOINTMENT: Windy conditions and lack of experi-
,ence played a part in a subpar perfonnance at the Nationa1s 

! • 

By KevIn McUuehlln 
Staff Writer 

In a season marlced with resplendent success, 
the men's cross country team encountered a 
tough situation this weekend at the National 
Championships in Illinois. 

Maybe it was the gusting wind, 
the frozen topsoil or a temperature 
of 45 degrees ai race time. Maybe 
it was the prospect of racing against 
the best of Division !fI - 184 of the 
nation' s top di stance runners. 
Maybe it was the jitters of racing in 
their first National Championships, 
experienced by four of the Triton's 
seven male contestants, character-
izing the lack of experience of the young squad. 
Whatever the cause, the resul t was a collective 
slap in the face to the men's cross country team. 

Though well rested and well prepared, the 
men si mply ran a poor race overall . Junior Steve 
Varnell tried to lind words for such adisappoint-
ing performance. 

" It was just a bad day. We felt pretty relaxed 
and pretty ready for it ; it was one of those days," 
he said. 

The team fini shed 21sl, while the other rep-
resentative of the Western Region, Colorado 
College, fi nished 19th. Three of the top four 
teams were from Wisconsin, indicating that the 
severity of the weather may have had sorne 
bearing on the performance of the c1imatically-
challenged Tritons. 

As tbe team got off to a slowstart,juniorNeal 
Harder took the reigns of leadership, finishing 
55th overall and running a tactically strong race. 
Following Harder were Varnell, fini shing 146th 
among all runners, and Franzwa Achie. 

Noticeably absent from the top ranks was 

overseas 
Automotive Repair. 
SEllVIIIS UCSD FOIl 16 YEARS! 

Gavin Klinger. "Consistently a rock," in the 
words ofHead Coach Ted Van ArsdaIe, Klinger 
''had his bad race of the year and it happened to 
be in Nationals." 

The team as a whole had a tlat race. Some-
times that happens, but it is certainly not what 

was hoped for in National Finals. 
Lack of experience undoubt-

edly factored into the team's sub-
par performance. With only three 
runner returning to Nationals 
competition, the team lacked im-
portant experience. 

Wi th such a young team, how-
ever, hopes for next season are 
high. The Tri ton men wi ll lose 

only Bryan Leek, a senior who struggled stub-
bornly against inj ury all season and fi nished 
fourth for the team thi s year in Nationals. The 
rest of the squad from what was truly an excel-
lent season remains intact. 

"When you look at conference and reg ional 
performances, it is indicative of how we' ve 
worked hard," said Van Arsdale. 

As for next year, Harder said, 'There' s no 
question in my mind we' ll return to Nationals." 

Representing the women, Maggie Dwire ran 
a quality race, placi ng III tho The' added expe-

-rience Dwire gained by running in Nationals 
will undoubtedly help the Triton women through-
out the next campaign, giving confidence to a 
young but talented women's team. 

Though a disappoi nting performance is not 
the desired way to wrap up a season, the team 
intends to rebound trongly. A philosophical 
Van Arsdale mused, " It 's disappointing that th is 
meet was the culmination of it all , but you learn 
from the bad times as well as the good. We will 
march back up. No doubt we' ll be back."

REVENGE: UCSD 
breaks jinx VS. Cal Lu 
ContInued from pace 24 
the Cal Lu attack and failed to capitalize on 
side-out opportunities_ The Regals kept the 
pressure on with tough serving, and used 
their setter as an attacker by sending the ball 
over on two hits. 

When the score had reached 11 -3 in favor 
orCal Lu, the Triton offense slowly came to 
life. Playing in their final match at home, the 
Triton seniors took it upon themselves to 
lead a comeback. 

"Our seniors really stepped up: Madelyn 
(Ripken), Christine (Chi ) and Micke 
(Biesheuvel)," McFarland sa id , "That was 
rea lly the difference. We al so got a great 
boost from Alli son (Bender) coming off the 
bench and doing such a great job as a fresh-
man. That was really a key." 

The Tritons slill found themselves on the 
brink of losing the game, after hack to back 
aces by Ebadi closed the gap to only 14-8. 
The Rega ls would never get the final point , 
as UCSD played its finest volleyball of the 
match. 

With Ebadi still serving, the Tritons 
continued to close the gap wi th two big 
blocks in the middle by Noonan. After a 
se ries of sideouts, with UCSD still fi ght-
ing off game poi nt , Biesheuvel served a 
clutch ace to close the gap to 13- 14. A kill 
by Ripken tied the score. With the crowd 
giving a standing ova ti on, the Tritons 
c linched the Western Region on two quick 
poinl s. 

As the fi nal ball touched down, ce lebra-
tion ensued and another step towards the 
goal of a national championship was taken. 
The Tritons had their revenge. 

"We fe lt that we had a rough time up in 
Cal Lu 's gym," McFarland said , "It was 
certainly a bitter defeat for thi s group las t 
year at this same spot. I think maybe less 

then revenge. it ~as a match that the team 
just really wanted to win. Having it at home 
and having it be the last shot for so many 
seniors, they felt it was a must-win match. 
rhey just couldn' t have accepted defeat at 
this point." 

UCSD travels to Minnesota to face St. 
Olaf in the Division III Quarterfinals on 
Saturday. The winner will move on to the 
Final Four. The Tritons have made II Final 
Four appearances in their history , the most 
of any Division 1lI school. During a road trip 
to Minnesota earlier this season, the Tritons 
defeated St. Olaf in four games.

.. ·Tritons Exact Revenge, Blast Regals from NCAAs 
COMEBACK: UCSD rallied from behind in game two and three en route to sweeping Cal Lu to win the Western Regionals 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports EdItor 

To la~le the spoils of victory In 
competition I~ the essence of all 
sporting events. To add the clement 
of revenge 10 that vic-
tor makes the celebra-
tion thai much sweeter. 

On aturday night. the 
UCSD women' s volley-
ball team got its revenge 
asitswcplarch-rivaICali-
fomia Lutheran. In doing 
so, the team captured the 
NCAA Division DI West-
ern Region championship and ad-
vanced to the quarterfinals of the na-
tional championship. 

Last year, in the very same match-
up. Cal Lu defeated the Tritons on 
the way to finishing as the national 
runner-up. This time around, UCSD. 

• ranked fourth in the nation, turned 
the tables and broke a three-match 
losing streak against the No. 3 
Regals. 

• Earlier this season, the Tritons 
traveled to Cal Lu and lost a heart-
breaking five-game match thai fea-
tured a miraculous comeback by 
Head COKh Duncan McFarland's" 
squad. Saturday's match included 
~.nother amazing rally by UCSD. 
only this time the Tritons came out 
on top. 

In ' front of a boi terous home 
crowd, complete with a face-painted 

men 's vo ll eyba ll team . CSD 
stormed out of the gales. Fo llowi ng 
a huge cross-court kill by senI or 
outSIde hitter Mi ke Bieshellvel, and 
a back-row winner from fellow se-

nior Madelyn Ripken. 
the Tritons took hold of 
a commanding 9-3 lead. 
Back-to-back so lo 
blocks by seller Sherine ' 
Ebadi and Shannon 
Noonan put the excla-
mation mark on the 
game, as UCSDcaptured 
the momentum and the 

Momentum has a funny way of 
shifting. Just when you think you 
have it, everything starts to fall apart. 
After a dominating first game, the 
Tritons suddenly found themselves 
deep in a hole at the tart of the 
second. Down6-3, McFarland called 
a time out to rally the team and to 

t>~cak up the tough serving of Cal 
Lli. 

The strategy worked for the Tri-
tons, who came out of the time out 
with new-found energy. A cross-
court smash by Allison Bender and 
a kill of an overpass by Ebadi forced 
the Regals to call a tnne out of their 
own. Even the stoppage of play 
couldn't stall the Tritons. as they 
closed out the game with a tough 
serve from Ripken and another kill 
by Bender.

P.tJ t .... : Sophomore back-row specialist Corrine Ritter (3) and the rest of the Tritons stormed the 
floor after coming from a 14-6 point deficit in the final game to oust Cal lutheran in straight sets. 

The second-game rally proved 
to be only a preview of things 10 
come. as the Trilons mounted their 
biggest comeback to finish off the 
match. 

Game three opened with the Tri-
tons once a,ain losing hold of Mr. 
Momentum. Before the UCSD 

women settled into their positions, 
the Regals jumped OUIto a 4-0 lead. 
Things quickly went from bad to 
worse, as the Tritons soon faced a 7-
I deficit, promptinl a time out call 
from McFarland. 

"I felt thal it was really critical 
that we gel going ... McFarland said, 

"Win or lose the third game, I felt 
thal it was such a pivotal poinl in the 
match. We jusl couldn't afford to 
give up as much momentum as we 
had." 

The rally would have to wail.
