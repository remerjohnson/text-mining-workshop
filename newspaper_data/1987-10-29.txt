Research on pound animals 
at UCSD comes under fire 
By NIKI NEWLANDS 
EJitor In CIUeI 

Animal rights activists are 
pressuring the San Diego &ard of 
Supervisorli to cancel UCSD's 
contract with county animal shelters 
to buy animals for research. The 
San Diego Coalition to End Pound 
Seizure, People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals (PET A) and 
various other local animal rights 
groups have redoubled their efforts 
to win public support. The Board of 
Supervisors is expected to hand 
down a decision in February, 1988. 

"We want the whole contract 
annulled," said Cris Waller, co-
ordinator of the San Diego Coali-
tion to End Pound Seizure. "It is 
rare to find animals used for 
research because they are the best 
[subject]. [In many studies,] there 
is no applicable use for humans." 

According to campus veterinar-
ian Dr. Jack Vanderlip, canceling 
UCSD's contract with the pound 
would have a "devastating effect 
on university research projects 

presently utilizing dogs from the 
pound." 

The controversy centers around 
four main issues: the type of animal 
available at the pound, the applic-
ability of animal research to 
humans, hlboratory care for the 
animals and practicality of alterna-
tive soul"£es of animals. 

Pets or strays? 
Waller defines a pet as any 

animal used to or that has exper-
ienced human contact. She con-
tends that the laboratory almos-
phere and research projects violate 
the human-animal bond formed by 
the original human contact outside 
the laboratory. 

"I think of a pet as an animal that 
is wanted and appropriately cared 
for by an owner," Vanderlip said. 
"My initial response is that this is a 
real black mark on society that 
those dogs are there in the first 
place. That's the real tragedy." 

"Why, if it is so terrible, why are 
we further exploiting these dogs?" 
Waller responded. "Why don't we 

punish the irresponsible and negli-
gent owners?" 

According to Hector Cazares, 
assitant director of the Central 
Animal Shelter, roughly 30,000 
animals a year are taken in by the 
pound. Of those 30,000 approxi-
mately 20,000 are put to sleep, 
9,150 are adopted, and &SO are 
sold to UCSD for research. 

Research capabilities 
Waller claims that much of the 

research conducted at UCSD could 
be carried out on animals other 
than pound dogs and even that 
some of the research is irrelevant. 

"Many researchers use dogs just 
because they are the standard 
model [or subject]," Waller said. 
[For instance,] in diabetes studies, 
metabolic acidosis can't be induced 
in dogs but they were used anyway. 
Artificially, it can be induced in 
pigs, which were also used. It seems 
redundant to use both dogs and 
pigs."

Hearings on 
teacher union's 
grievance end 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
New. EJitor 

Another battle in the war between 
the UCSD administration and the 
American Federation of Teachers 
was recently concluded, as hear-
ings before administrative judge 
Manuel Melgoza on possible con-
tract violations by the administra-
tion were wrapped up last Tuesday 
in downtown San Diego. 

Within a month or so the trans-
cripts for the hearings, which took 
five days to complete, will be 
made available to the lawyers for 
both sides, and they will then pre-
pare their briefs. Melgoza, who 

works for the Public Employee 
Relations Board (PERB), will re-
view both the transcripts and briefs, 
and make a decision by next spring. 
If the losing side wishes to appeal, 
they may do so to the full PERB, 
whose jurisdiction includes state-
run institutions of higher educat.ion 
in California. 

The contract in question was 
signed by the University of Califor-
nia (UC) and the University Coun-
cil, American Federation of Teach-
ers (UC-AFT) and went into effect 
July 1, 1986. The contract applies 
to the approximately 2,000 non-
senate faculty, mostly lecturers,

Minority groups protest discrimination 
By JAMES P. PINPIN 
Stall Writer 

A coalition of minority groups 
will be staging a statewide protest 
next week based on the theme that 
education is a right, not a privilege. 

Sponsored by the California 
Statewide Movimiento Estudiantl 
Chicano di Aztlan (MEChA), the 
African/Black Student Statewide 
Alliance (A/BSSA) and the Asian 
Pacific Student Alliance (APSA), 
the protest is a continuation of the 
march for education made by 5,000 
students and concerned commun· 
ity members on the state capitol in 
Sacramento last April 6. 

"The purpose of the protest is to 
continue the message that educa-
tion is a right and not a privilege," 
Dixie Diaz, (UCSD) Asian-Amer-
ican Studies Committee (AASC) 
representative, said. 

The issues to be dealt with by the 
protestors include the vetoes by 
Gov. Deukmejian of the Bilingual 
Education Bill and the CSU '88 
Moratorium Bill, other financial aid 
cuts, tuition fee hikes, and the dec-
lining enrollment of Thir~ World 
students in California universities. 

According to Diaz, the protest 
will consist of individual or local 
campus efforts with each campus 
raising their specific issues, as well 

as two statewide efforts - cen-
terpieces of the protest - in the 
form of rallies . A North California 
rally will be held at San Francisco 
State at Nov. 2, 12 noon, while a 
South California rally will be held at 
Cal State Los Angeles (time and 
date to be announced. 

At UCSD, local protest organiz-
ers will be sending out petitions 
demanding an Asian-American 
studies program. 

Samoa Koria, AASC represen-
tative and APSA coordinator, 
stressed that UCSD is the only uni-
versity in the UC system (aside 
from UCSF) without such a pro-

gram. Koria added that two good 
reasons why Asian -American 
Studies should be a permanent and 
equal part of the UCSD curriculum 
are the Pacific Rim School and the 
increase in research of Asian-Am-
erican people. 

As explained by members of 
AASC, their upcoming proposal to 
the Academic Senate include the 
recruitment and appointment of a 
tenured faculty to teach and develop 
the program, the development of 
an Asian-American Studies minor, 
funding to develop Asian-Amer-
ican courses and maintain their 
relevance, active student participa-
tion in the development of the pro-

grams, and the assigning of an 
actual office for the program. 

Koria concluded by inviting all 
student organizations to use the 
Week of Protest as a springboard 
to voice their concerns. "It is an 
opportunity for all organizations on 
campus to help build their found-
ations. I think the Week of Protest 
could bring out issues that may 
concern MEChA, ASU, Kaibiganll 
[Filipino], ASA, CSA, the A.S. 
Council. . . so everybody on this 
campus could use this event for 
their benefit in terms of helping to 
build more support [and] recruit 
more members into their 0!l.: 
anizations." ~

Volunteers needed for 
depression studies 

Individuals between 18 and 65 who 
suffer from depression are needed to 
participate in studies being conducted by 
UCSD School of Medicine psychiatrists. 

A variety of studies are under way to 
identify the underlying causes of 
depression. The research, based at the 
Veterans Administration Medical Center 
in La Jolla, includes sleep, hormone and 
drug studies, and research on the effects 
of depression on the immune system. 

Symptoms of depression include 
persistent feelings of sadness, 
hopelessness, anxiety and fatigue , an 
inability to concentrate and abnormal 
sleep patterns. The UCSD studies are 
helping researchers to better understand 
the causes of depression and to develop

More women in UC's 
management 

Women executives, administrators and 
managers at the University of California 
continue to increase in numbers 
making up 43.6 percent of the total 
workforce in this category, according to a 
new report on staff and management 
affirmative action. The number of women 
in UC's management ranks increased 
three percent between 1983 and 1986, 
the largest gain by women in any of the 
six standard federal occupational 
categories . The categories are 
executi ve/ administrative/ managerial , 
professional/ non.faculty, secretarial! cler. 
ical, technical/paraprofessional, skilled 
cralts, and service/maintenance. 

Minority representation within the UC 
non· academic workforce also increased 
in all malor occupational areas during the 
three·year period, according to the 
report, presented July 16 to the UC 
Board of Regents at its meeting at 
UCLA. 

As UC's non·academic workforce 
increased from 45,870 in t 983 to 
50,652 in 1986, minority representation 
increased from 15,199 (33.1 percent) to 
17,271 (34.1 percent) , the report found. 
The number of women in the non· 
academic workforce increased from 
30,259 (65.9 percent) to 33,432 (66 
percent). Their largest numerical gain 
was in the professional/non.faculty 
category, increasing by 1,831 over the 
three.year period, and representing 69.4 
percent of the total. 

According to the report, minority 
women increased in five of the six occu· 
pational categories, including a gain of 
0 .6 percent (45) among executives, 
administrators and managers. Minority 
women now comprise seven percent 
(165) of UC's workers in this category.

Tours of Old Scripps 
Pier offered 

Enjoy a leisurely afternoon stroll on the 
historic old Scripps Pier before it 
becomes a faded memory. The 
aquarium-museum at UCSD's Scripps 
Institue of Oceanography is offering free , 
guided tours of the old Scripps Pier Sun· 
days, November 1, 8, and 15 from 1 to 
4 pm. 

The historic pier , built in 1916, will be 
dismantled by the end of the year. It has 
been a prominent landmark on the La 
Jolla coastline and has been closed to the 
public since World War II. 

Construction on the new Ellen Brown-
ing Scripps Memorial Pier is currently 
underway and will be completed within 
the next few months. As with the old 
pier, the new pier will be used to supply 
fresh seawater to Scripps Aquarium , to 
launch small, research boats for local 
experiments, and to take daily tempera-
ture readings of the Pacific Ocean. It also 
serves as a platform for a variety of 
ocean projects. 

This will be the last opportunity for the 
public to walk on the old Scripps Pier. 
Bring your camera, stroll on a piece of 
San Diego history, and take home a 
memory that will last forever. For more 
information, call Scripps Aquarium.

research at UCSD, said that he and 
fellow researchers "went way out of 
our way not to use animals for as 
long as we could, and when we did, 
to assure that they were com· 
fortable ." 

Gough's studies involve the 
measurement of glucose. He is test· 
ing a device that measures glucose 
in diabetics. 

"For the first 10 years, we didn't 
use any animals," Gough said. "All 
studies were done in vitro because 
we were not ready to use animals.

Gough said. "They are beller fed 
and receive better medical aUen-
tion. " 

"Some concentration camps are 
better than others ," Waller 
responded. "The animal only suffers 
three days at the pound, whereas if 
they are sold for research, they 
spend six days at the pound and 
then suffer in the laboratory." 

The United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) conducts 
yearly inspections of all laborato-
ries at UCSD. A report from 1985 
listed such deficiencies as "an 
extremely fetid odor thruout [sic],

connected to a telemeter, a one· 
inch by one-half-inch thick device 
implanted under the skin. This 
allows the animal to be free rang-
ing, without any wires protruding 
from the skin," Gough explained. 

"It's extremely insignificant (to 
the dog). One dog was even 
adopted after the telemeter was 
taken out," Gough said .

"There is really no other source

Editor: 

I am writing in response to the

facts stra ight about the game 
against UC Sa nta Cruz. My side of

which the anta Cru ?Iayer was

my personal philosophy nor our 
team philosophy to deliberately 
hurt a n opponent dUring a game. A 
pa rt of our philosophy is , however, 
to be aggressive a nd to challenge 
for all loose kicks and passes , 
whether on the ground or in the air . 
I think any soccer player, including 
those 01 UC Santa Cruz, will agree 
that this is good soccer; aggression 
WinS games. 

The play which developed into 
the accident was just such a stray 
pa ss, a lofty free kick into a crowded 
a rea . The Santa Cruz player by no 
means had control of the ball ; 
rather, it was "up for grabs." Yes, I 
went in hard , but I went lor the ball, 
not the player. I still feel that the 
acc ident occurred not because I 
went in too aggressively, but be· 
cause the resulting contact was 
awkward a nd unusual. 

As " Name W ithheld" said , 
" Injuries happen in a thletics ." Col· 
lisions are not uncommon in soccer, 
a nd a ll soccer players take the risk 

of injury every time they step onto 
the field . The accident was in no 
way " outright violence," a view the 
referree sha red since he did not call 
a foul on the play. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not 
indiffe rent to the injured player. I 
am truly sorry that he was hu rt a nd 
hope that he is okay. The state· 
ment "the pla yer [me] made no 
attempts to make amends .. . " is 
false . Three or four minutes alter 
the collision I a pproached the 
player, asked him If he wa. okay, 
and told him I wa orry. He really 
made no response (he probably 
didn't remember it because of the 
partial a mnesia). but one of his 
teammate. . hook my hand and 
said "It's cooL" Apparently he, like 
the referee, understood that the 
challenge was lega l. 

Again, I attack "Name With· 
held"'s claim that UCSD soccer 
players " take out" opponents. We 
have won 10 other games in which 
none of our opponents were serious· 
ly injured. It was simply a freak 
accident. 

The members of our team a re 
proud to represent the UCSD stu· 
dent body. We put in untold hours 
of hard training with the hope that , 
in return , the team's aggressive 
style of play and winning tradition 
can be a source of pride to UCSD 
students . 

We have had a good season up 
to now, and we will conti nue to play 
as hard as we can until we either 
win or must be dragged off the field . 
We hope that "Na me Withheld"'s 
views are in the minority.

become tangled in a seven year.oId 
war between Iran and Iraq. Sure 
the U.S. is far too powerful to lose a 
war to Iran, but we are talking 
about risking the lives of many 
Americans. 

The only forseeable way out of 
this dilemma is for the United 
Nations to order a cease fire in the 
Persian Gulf, and an international 
arms embargo on Iran to enforce it. 
The United Nations should also 
declare that Iraq started the seven 
year war, which is what Iran has 
been trying to tell countries for 

years . Although there is only a 
small chance of deterring Iran, it is 
a chance the U.S . will have to take 
to avoid an outright war. If the Iran-
ians are unwilling to cooperate, 
then the United States could retal. 
iate mibtarily. 

In my opinion, the United States 
would achieve more recognition for 
giving the Iranians a chance to 
work things out, rather than reta. 
liating immediately. Since the Iran. 
ians have declared war against 
America, now would be the most 
beneficial time for the United 
Nations to step in . I think that the 
Iranians must give in to the U.N. 
demands or else succumb to another 
war.

Division III teams

Editor: 
Regarding Phil Gruen's article 

on intramural sports (the Guardian, 
10/22): 

Mr. Gruen rightfully advocates 
our excellent intramural program. 
However, he cites its specialty as 
"primarily due to the fact that the 
intercollegiate program here is Div· 
ision III of the NCAA, which is far 
less competitive than, say, intercol· 
legiate sports at the Division I 
level."

Division I athletics at UCSD and 
Division III athletics' here , I know

that the level of competition here is 
at least equal to Division J. Calling 
it less so is ludicrou~ . Because Div. 
ision III schools prohibit athletic 
scholarships, our athletes compete 
solely for the love of competition 
itself, often against so called 'more 
competitive' Division I schools 
(witness last week 's water polo vic· 
tory over Pepperdine). 1 don't have 
to cite our intercollegiate teams' 
past success records . 

Our intramural program is ex· 
ceptional , as is our intercollegiate 
program. For optimum success, 
they must work positively together . 
Mr. Gruen's view of intramurals as 
surrollate for our 'less competitive' 
intercollegiate athletics program is 
precisely th~ attitude which fosters

that work for the UC and will 
remain in effect until June 30, 
1988. Examples of faculty at 
UCSD that are covered by the 
agreement, which is formally known 
as the Memorandum of Under-
sta nding (MOU), include most of 
the instructors for Muir, Warren, 
and Third writing courses, and the 
Reve lle Humanities sequence. 

The dispute between the union 
and the administration centers on 
the issue of courscload equivalen. 
cies; ~peci fJcally , how much a par· 
IIcular course is va lued when calcu-
la ting the workload for a faculty 
member. According to Dr. Sta nley 
Chodorow , dean of Arts and Hu· 
ma nities , and under who~e aegi~ 
UCSD writing courses come, two 
main factors are considered when 
figuring the workload of a course 
-the level of preparation required 
for the class (by the professor), and 
the number of students in the class . 
" Writing courses [at UCSD] are 
the smallest in the UC system, 
[and] there is not a sufficient work . 
load [to merit them being worth an 
instructional workload course]. " 

An instructional workload course 
is defined in the MOU as "an 
instructional offering that is regu-
larly scheduled, requires significant 
academic preparation outside the 
class by the instructor, and meets a 
minimum of three (3) hours a 
week ." Most courses are worth 
1.0, some are worth more, and 
according to the MOU, courses only 
involving lab supervision, T.A. 
supervision, studio instruction or 
clinical instruction may be valued 
at less than 1.0. 

Nine instructional workload 
courses per year must be taught by 
instructors at UCSD who are 
covered by the MOU, equaling a 
yearly courseload of 9.0. UCSD is 
the only UC campus to require a 
nine-course load; at other campuses 
nine courses i5 the maximum. 
Because writing courses were given 
a value of .75 when course values 
were formulated for UCSD last 
January, writing instructors are 
forced to teach 12 courses a year to 
receive full pay for their position. A 
writing instructor who, for exam-
ple, taught 9 courses, would receive 
75 percent of full pay for that 
position. 

"Anyone using reasonable aca-
demic judgement who examined 
the [UCSD] writing programs would 
have to determine that these courses 
meet the definition of an instruc-
.tional workload course," said Dr. 
Thomas Dublin, UCSD history pro-
fessor and statewide president of 
the AFr. Dublin admitted that the 
MOU, formulated al the behest of 
the AFr, is vague as to what 
exactly an inltructional workload 
course is. AFT lawyer Lawrence 
Rosenzweig believes that the final 
decision will depend primarily on

the judge's interpretation of the 
MOU. 

According to Dublin, the Coun-
cil of Writing Courses, consisting of 

. writing program coordinators from 
all the UC campuses, has recom· 
mended that writing courses be 
given a value of somewhere· 
between 1.25 and 1.5. The Eng-
lish Counca, made up of regular 
profelllors in the UC, recommend. 
a value of 1.28. UCSD writing 
course. currently have the lowe.t 
value of any in the University of 
California . 

Chodorow explained this as being 
a product of the low number of stu-
dents, 12 to IS, in each UCSD 
writing course section, and the re -
petitiveness involved in teaching 
four writing sections a quarter. 
When asked if it was possible that 
an instructor who had fewer stu-
dents would spend more time with 
each one, thus equaling the work -
load of an instructor with a larger 
claSll, Chodorow replied, "In the-
ory that's possible, [but] there i. an 
amount of time that is useful to 
apend with ltudentl. MOlt people 
[instructorl] regulate their time 
(with each atudent.f' He feels that 
below a certain cia .. size, no more 
time i. lpent with each ltudent than 
would be above that cia .. size. 

Chodorow believes the focu s of 
the case is "whether the University 
[of California] has the right to exer· 
cise judgement. The union cannot. 
The union is not part of the univer-
sity." He said that while the univer-
sity is always concerned about 
"equity," and treating non-senate 
faculty fairly , " the MOU raises our 

. , 
consciousness - we re even more 
carefuL.we have a much more 
elaborate workload policy [with the 
MOU than before)." 

AFr attorney Rosenzweig de.· 
cribed the union's philolOphy of 
courseload determination as one in 
which the "administration may have 
veto power. Jt should be .. bottom 
up proce .. , not top down." ~

Grad school: Do ' 
you know where 
you're going to? 
By JEFF SCHLICT 

I f the question of what you're going to do alter graduation has been plaguing you, and graduate school has been one of your considered solutions, then the annual Professional and Graduate 
School Information Day is a day to pencil in on your calendar. 

On this upcoming Monday, November 2, the Career Services 
Center will host a record·breaking 90 schools on the Career Servi· 
ces plaza (across from the Student Health Center). From II am 
until 2 pm recruiters representing a wide range of professional and 
graduate proglams will be on campus to answer s tudent question 
about their schools. 

In an effort to make locating programs inyolving individual areas 
of interest as quick and easy as possible, the plaza will be divided by 
specialization into four "parks." One area will be designated for 
programs involved in the health professions - medical, dental, 
optometric, chiropractic, and pharmaceutical schools. 

Please see GRAD, page 9

final park will consist of colleges 
and universities recruiting for aca · 
demic degree (Master and Doclo ·

According to Cyndie Morozumi .

year ma rks the first time UCSD has 
had to turn schools away from 
attending the fair. There are three

reasons for this . One, Noyember 2 
is early enough that it avoids the 
rush of similar programs at other 
nationa l institutions and ensures 
that school reps will be ayailable to 
come to UCSD. 

Secondly , unlik e previous years, 
MBA programs will be included in 
the presenta tion. In the past the 
Career Services held a ~epa ra te 
day for schools providing MBA 
programs. 

Finally, the dramatic increase in 
a ttendance reflects the rise in sta · 
ture that UCSD has gained in 
recent years as a front .running 
national university . UCSD gradu . 
a tes are in demand in all fields of 
graduate and professional s.tudy. 

Last year 28 percent of 
UCSD graduates chose 
to continue their edu-
cation on a full time 
basis. 

Recru ite rs at the ta bles will be 
able to proYlde a variety of infor· 
mation for the inquiring student. 
Appli allon material~ , fellowship

Last year, 28 percent of UCSD

you a re o ne of this year's grads 
with simila r intentions, or even If 
you are an underclassman seeking 
direction, Graduate Day provides 
you with a chance to discover just

Big weekend for Triton athletics 
The falls sports season is quickly 

coming to a close and all five teams 
participating this year (men's and 
women's soccer, women's volley-
ball, men 's water polo and cross 
country) have all found themselves 
in the heat of the battle, fighting for 
the chance to represent UCSD in 
post-season, regional and national 
competition. This weekend repres-
ents final chances for some and 
seals the hopes of others. Either 
way, the men and women athletes 
have once again proven that UCSD 
is a force to be reckoned with, not 
only as an academic institution, but 
as an athletic power as well. 
Men', soccer 

This is it. It's do or die for the 
men's soccer team this weekend, 
especially if they ha ve any desire to 
make the playoff s this year_ They 
are currently ranked number 13 in 
Division III competition (their first 
ranking in the top twenty in over 
four weeks) a nd are ranked number 
two in the west, up four from 
number six last week. The jump is 
due primarily to key wins over La 
Verne and Claremont during the 
past week. 

The Tritons will have played a total 
of four Division I schools by the end 
of the regular season. 

The first game against USIU 
begins at 1 pm this Friday at USIU_ 
The second game is on Saturday, 
beginning at 1 pm on Warren Field 
East, located across from the 
Canyonview pool, in the northeast 
corner of campus. Last year, the 
men's soccer team lost in the Div-
ision III Championships to take 
second place. They are hoping to 
take it a ll this year. But their road to 
success begins with these two 
games_ .. 
Women',socce r 

The women's soccer team enters 
this weekend with a 13-3-1 record 
and, with a number two tanking, 
almost a definite spot in the upcom-
ing regionals. With most of the 
pressure off their minds, the women 
will be more relaxed to take on two 
tough teams on Frid ay and Sunday. 

On Friday, the women hosl rival 
Cal Poly Pomona at 3 pm on 
Warren Field East. The Tritons 
have a lready played a nd beaten 
Pomona last weekend at Pomona 
in what Coach Brian McManus 
could only only desc ribe as 
"intense" compe tition. Another 
good match is expected this time as 
well. 

GET B'f THESE TWO AND A PLA'fOFF BEIlTH IS 'fOUllS _ .. 

Invitation to the playoff depends 
on two major factors : the ability to 
beat schools in the division and 
geographical area and the appear-
ance of the win-loss columns. The 
men's soccer team successfully sat-
isfied the first requirement with the 
wins over La Verne and Clare-
mont. However, during the season, 
they have already posted four 
losses, a number head coach Derek 
Armstrong would rather forget. 

"We cannot alford to lose any-
more games," explained Armstrong 
in a telephone interview yesterday. 
"With only two games left, the 
selection committee is not likely to 
choose a team with six losses to go 
to the plavoffs." 

On Sunday, SI. Mary's College 
comes to town. SI. Mary's team 
has taken the last two NAJA 
championships and have been 
promoted to Division I competi-
tion. Their team includes a number 
of All-American players that are 
bound to give the Tritons a difficult 
challenge. The kickoff is at 12 
noon on Muir Field. 

Victories over both these teams 
will guarantee a playoff berth, but 
the team is looking for more than a 
chance to play post-season ball; 
they would like to play al home. 
The committee chooses the loca-
tion of the regionals by looking at 
records, location and even the 
enthusiasm of the schools. So large 
crowds are key .. . 

Weekend Spor 
So it comes down to this week: 

end, as the Tritons take on both 
USIU and USD in a USIU-hosted 
tournament for their last two games 
of the regularly scheduled season. 
What makes the task of defeating 
these two teams even more difficult 
is that they are both Division I 
schools. 

"Unfor tunately, that's the way 
we set up our schedule," explained 
Armstrong_ "We try to set up a 
program that gives our boys a chal-
lenge, a program that will give 
them some good games to play ." 

Women', volleyball 
The women's volleyball takes 

the title of "busiest team" this week-
end as thev host their annual 
UCSD Invitational Tournament. 
Participating schools are Cla re-
mont, La Verne a nd Cal State San 
Bernardino. The Tritons are carry-
ing a 23 game win streak against

This was the most exciting game of the season. ADIOS AMI GaS 
had been cleaning up the league, outscoring their opponents 2<r 
O. Led by Pam Saldana (8 goals on the season}, the Amigos took a 
qUick 2-0 lead, but the Cunning UngulllS responded with their 
own Wayne Gretzky, .Jen Willen. The game was fast and furious 
with action at both ends of the rink. 

It was tied well into the 3rd period when the Unguists' Amanda 
Rickett snuck in and put her team ahead. The Amigos again tied it 
with a goal from Saldana, but on that day nothing was going to 
keep the Unguists from winning. With 1:58 left in the game, Willen

Halloween is that time of 
the year fondly remembered 
for its school carnivals and 
parties. a time when bobbing 
for apples carving up pump 
kins and eating too much 
candy were looked forward to 
with breathless anticipation. 
Nowadays, we breathe quite 
normally around the end of 
October and the entertainment 
possibilities have changed as 
well. There are still plenty of 
sca res abounding , from 
haunted houses to a horror 
movie film festival. There are 
also plenty of Halloween balls 
and even a performance of 
"Dracula." The only thing

Repertory Theatre . 
This comedy is set in a 

video store, New Year's Eve 
1987, as the protagonist Vinny 
contemplates becoming the 
store manager. He doesn't 
want to, but he feels it's time 
to become "real" and stop 
dreaming. "First Night" takes 
off from this point, as we see 
the hilarious occurences which 
make this New Year's Eve a 
"first night" for Vinny. 

When the play begins, we 
see a strange looking set of a 
video store - everything is 
painted light blue with clouds 
on it, including the floor. 
Vinny, in the first of many 
monologues to the audience. 
explains that we are about to 
wi tness his memory, so he can 
make it look any way he wants. 
He then establishes the premise 
of his memory . 

It is New Year's Eve, and he 
is about to become the store 
manager, but he tells us that 
something will happen to make 
him question his choice. This 
"something" will take the form 
of Meredith O'Conner, a 
former classmate of Vinny's 
who had become a nun after 
the eighth grade. Vinny and 
Meredith are the only two 
characters in the play, and 
their two-hour interplay in 
which she challenges his accep-
tance of the mundane is the 
only "action." Butdon't think 
that this play is a deep analysis 
of how people choose their 
li(estyles, because it isn't. All 
it is, is entertaining. 

One might think that two 
hours of dialogue between two 
characters would become 
boring, but it doesn't. The 
writing in the play is terrific, 
and the jokes come at a furious 
pace. The audience seemed to 
be laughing every other minute 
- a phenomenon you don't 
encounter in most of today's 
popular entertainment, like 
TV or movies. Vinny, played 
by Vinny Ferrelli, had an

Dark clouds rolled across

and I had been waiting with 
several other reporters from 
San Diego colleges and high 
schools for over 45 minutes, 
when out of a crowd appeared 
a familiar face accompanied 
by two men in suits and ties . 

Jon Cryer, wearing a dress 
shirt, sport coat, and black 
denim jeans, looked pale and 
tired. He stood with his hands 
in his pockets while the pub-
licity crew organized the in-
formal press conference out-
side the student center at San

eral chairs were hastily ar-
ranged for the reporters to 
interview Cryer. Finally set-
tled, the press conference 
began.

Sitting in the middle of a

and facing a row of interview-

he was a self-proclaimed loner

"I am not Matthew Broder-

voice before the questions

endless supply of witty one-
liners that kept the audience at 
attention the entire time. 

Ferelli is an excellent de-
liveryman, and seems to com-
pletely embody his character. 
Carmen Beaubeaux, who plays 
Meredith, doesn't seem as 
comfortable with her charac-
ter . Many of her actions 
seemed overblown and false. 
However, after a while the 
overacting isn't very notice-
able. 

An interesting thing about 
this play is its timeliness. It 
definitely takes place in 1987. 
There were cbnstant reterences 

to current pt'oplt" and events, 
including Star Trek, Jane 
Pauley, Cheers, and L.A. Law. 
These references to the present 
were the basis for most of the 
humor in the play, drawing 
the audience into a world they 
could believe. Obviously, this 
play won't be around in SO 
years, since nobody will appre-
ciate all of the '80s humor, but 
it is ex ellent entertainment 
for the moment, and definitely 
worth a try if you are tired of 
dry "comedies" that leave you 
laughless. 

" First Night" will run 
through December 19 at the 
North Coast Repertory 
Theatre , in Solana Beach. 
Tickets are $9 on Thursdays 
and Sundays, and $11 on 
Fridays and Saturdays. For 
tickets or more information,

This week UCSD's Annex Gallery features works by 
:i Mike Weix. In a sneak preview Friday, Weix gave a sam-y 
:> pie of his work and techniques used for a particular piece. 
~ "I use a good amount of paint and a single smooth stroke 
2 with each color," Weix said as he painted before the 
o i. audience. 

Only three colors were used in a postcard.:size oil paint-
ing of a wave. "It's the same wave that you can see around 
town on the sides of buildings. I'm going to put them all 
together into a big long ocean series." he said. 

There will be approximately 35-40 pieces shown, with 
many different subjects of Weix's "representational" 
paintings which include wildlife and natural landscapes. 
He is also showing a "sculpture collection, a urine sample 
collection, and a first year review paper." 

The show will run through Friday, Oct. 30.

roles will lead toward more 
adult roles. Eventually, Cryer 
would like to direct films and 
said that he would particularly 
enjoy working with Monty 
Python'S Terry Gilliam. Cry-
er's next acting roles in the 
soon-to-be released film, 
"Dudes." As for future roles, 
Cryer said he would "like to 
playa villain - a real jerk." 
He jokingly added, "I'd like to 
play Matthew Broderick's evil 

twin brother." 
Despite a long grueling day 

of PR work, Cryer was perso-
nable and engaging during the 
45-minute press conference. 
When the publicity crew 
informed him it was time to 
go, Cryer had finally relaxed 
and was apprehensive to leave. 
He graciously shook the hands 
of his interviewers and, smil-
ing, waved goodbye to the 
crowd.
