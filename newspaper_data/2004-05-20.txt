Five UCSD students were 
arrested for civil disobedience after 
a rally on May 18 protesting the 
compact made by UC President 
Robert C. Dynes, Gov. Arnold 
chwarzenegger and CSU 

Chancellor Charles B. Reed, which 
includ increases in undergraduate 
and graduate fees and allocates 
long-term funding to the university. 

er 300 students and staff from 
UCSD, San Diego tate University 
and local community colleges par-
ticipated in the rally, according to 
Jessica Lopez, an organizer for the 
Stop the Cuts Coalition at UCSD, 
which organized the event. 

After a rally at Price Center 
Plaza, protesters marched through 
the intersection of Villa La Jolla 
and La Jolla Village Drive and 
topped traffic for 15 minutes. A 

select group of coalition members 
who were prepared to be arrested 
tood in the center of the intersec-

tion when police arrived, accord-
ing to Chris Sweeten, A.S. com-
missioner of diversity affairs, who 

al 0 participated in the rally . 
UCSD students Harish 

Nandagopal, Josh Wilson, Sarah 
John on, Irmary Reyes-Santos and 
Erica Kermani were arrested 
along with two other students, one 
from Southwestern College and 
one from San Diego State. 

"We wanted to show the state 
Legislature that students aren't 
going to sit down while they take 
our money," Sweeten said. "We're 
willing to go to extremes - and 
that means missing our classes and 
getting arrested - to how that 
we're a united front and we won't 
rop until the rights of student 

have been met." 
Nandagopal, who was charged 

with a misdemeanor, aid he felt 
this wa their last recourse . 

"We tried everything - we 
tried letter-writing, we tried lob-
bying," he said. "The governor 
turned his back on us, and Dynes 
and Reed turned their backs on us 
too. We wanted to send a message 
that we're not happy."

Star Wraps replacement 
to be considered 

UCAB cites 'secret shoppers' 
results as reason for move 
By eHllmNE ME 

Senior Staff Writer 

Star Wraps restaurant at Price 
Center may not return next year 
due to its failure to meet 
University Center Advisory 
Board standards, according to 
UCAB officials. UCAB is consid-
ering the possibility of replacing 
Star Wraps with an alternative 
restaurant that offers wraps, but 
in addition to other food options. 

According to Director of 
University Centers Gary Ratcliff, 
UCAB opted for a "secret shop-
per" system to test Star Wraps in 
terms of service and taste. 

UCAB Food Committee 
members posed as customers and 
rated quality of food and service. 

The reason for considering 
the replacement of Star Wraps is 
not due to failed health inspec-
tions, which are performed by the 
University quarterly, but is a 
result of the secret shopper 
results, which demonstrated low 
satisfaction with service and food 
quality, according to Ratcliff. 

"The feedback from students 
and from the secret shopper pro-
gram gave us some concerns 
about the food offerings of Star 
Wraps," Ratcliff said. "I thinlc it's a

restaurants that might be a better

Star Wraps, which has been on 
a month-to-month lease since 
August 2003, was notified in late 
April by University Centers that 
outside requests for a replace-
ment would be considered, 
according to Star Wraps manager 
Damon Woo. 

UCAB has decided to launch a 
"request for proposal" for restau-
rants interested in a lease at Price 
Center. The RFP consists of a

brought to the police station, cited 
and released. 

"We were lobbying the 
Legislature, not the police, and we 
would be blocking traffic, so we 
wanted to ensure everyone's safety," 

Lopez said. "The police helped us 
put on a peaceful and safe protest."

Technical glitches vexed a new 
online service used by more than 
2,700 students to select on-cam-
pus housing during the first three 
days of the room selection 
process. 

At John Muir College, which 
felt the brunt of the problems, 
the glitches kept residence hall 
spaces inaccessible for more than 
two hours after the stan of resi-
dential registration on May 18. 
The hitch led angered students to 
petition and ask the college's 
Residential Life officials to 
address the concerns of students 
dissatisfied with the process. 

"We're not placing blame, but 
we're taking responsibility [for 
some of the problems]. For a 
first-time system, we learned 

something, that's for sure," Muir 
Resident Dean Pat Danylyshyn-
Adams said. 

The college'S staff first learned 
of the error when a student, 
attempting to secure a room in a 
residence hall, came into the 
office at approximately 10 a.m., 
two hours after the room selec-
tion process began, Danylyshyn-
Adams said. Afterward, the staff 
contacted technical personnel at 
Housing and Dining Services, 
who fixed the problem within 30 
minutes. 

"Essen~ially, what had hap-
pened is that we didn't realize that 
our residence hall space wasn't up 
for selection," she said. "My goal 
at that point was to get it working 
as quickly as we could."

Regents 
deadlocked 

on fee 
• Increases 

Board to vote 
on fee levels on 

May 20 
By BIYAN TSAO 

Associate News Editor 

The finance committee of the 
Board of Regent deadlocked on a 
vote to ra ti fy fee increase pro-
po ed in the compact reached by 
UC President Robert C. Dynes 
CSU hancellor Charle B. Reed 
and Gov. Arnold Schwarzcnegger. 
The compact propose, a 14-pcr-
cent increase for 1I1 -~ta t( under-
graduates and a 20-percent 
increase for graduate students for 
the 2005-06 acadeffiJc year. 

After hearing remarks by Dynes 
and a presentation by UC Vice 
President for Budget Larry 
Ilirschman, the committee voted 
5-5 on the proposal. The full Board 
of Regents will consider the pro-
posal on May 20. 

The compact must be approved 
by the California Legislature a pan 
of the annual state budget. 
According to Hirschman, the com-
pact acts as the foundation for fumre 
state allocations to higher education. 
Historically, the Legi lature has aug-
mented compacts with additional 
funding. According to Hirschman, 
some Democrats in the state assem-
bly are discussing a $225-million 
increase in funding to the University 
of California in addition to the funds 
provided in the compact. 

"If you take a look at all of their 
actions, in our case they appear to 
be headed toward an augmentation 
of $225 million and a total augmen-
tation for higher education of $500 
million ... that's a very substantial 
amount of money," Hirschman 
said. "We don't know what the 
Senate wants to do yet, but they're 
likely to also be augmenting the 
budget, and we don't know what the 
governor is going to do. He is goi ng 
to end up negotiating the budget 
with the Legislature." 

Dynes, who negotiated the 
compact, believes that the proposal 
would help give the university 
funding stability in future year. 

"In my view, it stops the bleeding 
in future years and allows liS to do 
some recovery on important issues 
like student-to-faculty ratio, faculty 
and staff salaries and some infra-
structure issues and deferred mainte-
nance; places where we are seriously 
in trouble right now," Dynes said. "It 
does promise more for the future -
it does not give us everything we 
need for the future, and certaJnly 
this year will continue to be a painful 
year - but at least it is a baseline

UCAB considers plans for 

grocery store at Price Center 
In light of the Price Center Expansion agen-

da for 2007, the University Centers Advisory 
Board is considering various locations for a gro-
cery store as well as potential operators. Pfans 
for a grocery store operated by the UCSD 
Bookstore were discussed at the UCAB meet-
ing on May 17. 

The expansion calls for an approximately 
3,500 square feet grocery store, as promised in 
the student referendum passed last year. 
According to UCAB officials, two options are cur-
rently pending. UCAB can either rent out space 
for a pnvate~ owned grocery store, or allow the 
Bookstore to fully fund and operate the store. 
UCAB also discussed the possibility of adding a 
Sixth Pnce Center restaurant to cover additional 
rent space if tine Bookstore controls the grocery 
store. 

According to UCAB officials, if the 
Bookstore funds and operates the grocery 
st9re, monies from the student-funded expan-
sion would not be used. Because of this, sev-
eral agreements between University Centers 
and the Bookstore were discussed. UCAB sug-
gested the development of a student advisory 
boa rd, With UCAB representation, to monitor 
the actiVities of the grocery store; an agree-
ment of common-area custodial maintenance; 
and a mission statement of mutual agreement 
between the Bookstore and University Centers. 

UCA~ is only discussing the matter and no 
final deciSions have been made. UCAB Chair 
Justin Will iams will present the resolution 
agreement to the Building Advisory Committee 
on May 26, and UCAB will make a final deci-
sion before tine end of spring quarter.

UCSD takes part in large-
scale emergency drin 

UCSD researchers and students from the 
Jacobs School of Engineering and the 
California Institute for Telecommunications and 
Information Technology participated in the 
largest emergency response drill ever held in 
San Diego County on May 12. The test was 
called Operation Moonlight and involved the 
simulation of a bomb explOSion inSide a 
Carlsbad office building. The simulation tested 
preparedness of first responders and emer-
gency-relief agencies, including police, firefight-
ers, parameaics and hazardous matenals 
crews. The simulation involved more than 1 B 
federal, state and local agencies in addition to 
local hospitals, SWAT teams, Red Cross and 
county health and emergency systems. A sec-
ond explosion simulated the detonation of a 
radiological bomb in the building's parking lot 

The drill, organized by San Diego's 
Metropolitan Medical Strike Team, helped 
researchers study new technologies that 
would operate in real emergency-response sit-
uations. 

During the drill, technicians used a 
CyberShuWe, a mobile command center out-
fitted with a wireless and cellular network to 
collect wireless data transmission from the 
"disaster site~ The data included victim tracking 
information and vital signs monitoring. 
Technology and equipment tested during the 
drill were developed at UCSD and CaI-(1T)2 . 
engineering labs. UCSD students who partici-
pated played "victims," enabling them to get a 
close-up look at how first responders use wire-
less technology and how it can be used to 
monitor Vital Signs. 

Debriefings and discussions on how to 
improve wireless technologies used during the 
drill and how to create a first-responder com-
puter system took place after the drill.

A.S. Council appoints 
student advocate 

Position switched from elected 
to appointed for the first time 
By MAlNmE FEDERIS 

Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Council approved the 
appoinnnent of Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore 
Denis Shmidt as the new commis-
sioner of student advocacy on May 
19. This marked the first time the 
council has chosen a commissioner 
through an appointment process, 
witham an election. All other com-
missioner positions are elected dur-
ing the yearly A.S. elections. 

"(Shmidt] was the most quali-
fied person," said A.S . President 
Jenn Pae, who submitted the legis-
lation to appoint Shmidt. "He has a 
lot of understanding of the office 
and brought wonderful ideas and 
insight to the position." 

According (0 Pae, the appoint-
ment process, which involved input 
from current Commissioner of 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd and two college 
senators, allowed her to choose the 
most qualified person for the posi-
tion. She also said that the process 
allowed for a larger pool of appli-
cants. 

"We wanted (0 make sure that 
the tudent advocate represented 
students," Pae said . "When the 
position was elected, there were 
usually only one or two [candi-
dates] who ran, but in this posi-
tion, there was a larger pool of 
people who were' aware of the dif-
ferent issues on campus to select 
from." 

The commissioner of advocacy 
position became an appointed one 
only after winter quarter 2004. 

Boyd submitted legislation to the 
former A.S. Council to change its 
constitution and also lobbied for 
college councils to approve the 
change. He said that the appoint-
ment process worked well for the 
commissioner of advocacy position. 

"It worked out wonderfully and 
we were very pleased with the num-
ber of applicants," Boyd said. "It 
was a very good process. The rea-
son why this position was appoint-
ed was since only the student advo-
cate can represent students at hear-
ings, it's highly important that the 
most qualified person be in the 
position." 

According to Boyd, the com-
missioner would need to know the 
university's judicial system and stu-
dent code. 

"From (the commissioner of 
advocacy position), we can further 
learn about the possibility of mak-
ing other commissioners appointed 
as well," Boyd said. 

Some of Shmidt's qualifications 
include service on the Thurgood 
Marshall College Judicial Board, 
the A.S. Judicial Board and the 
Academic Misconduct Judicial 
Board. Shmidt also has experience 
working with the Student Policie 
and Judicial Affairs Office and as a 
mock trial lawyer.

GENDER., UCSD: PART 3 OF ] 

UCSD part of national trend with fewer 
women faculty hired in technical fields 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD and dozens of other top 
research universities were found 
to hire few female faculty mem-
bers to instruct technical subjects, 
according to recent smdies high-
lighting the extent of national 
underrepresentation of women in 
science and engineering fields. 

The nationwide "representa-
tion of women and minorities in 
science and engineering generally 
is far below that needed to ensure 
the national security, economic 
superiority and scientific leader-
ship of our country," a January 
report on 50 of the nation's top 
research instimtions stated, calling 
the issue a "grave concern." 

Women with the appropriate 
doctorate degrees and qualifica-
tions are are not being hired into 
teaching positions, the report said, 
estimating that the percentage of 
women professors in technical 
fields remains between 3 and 15 
percent. The report, ti tied "A 
National Analysis of Diversity in 
Science and Engineering Faculties 
at Research Universities," did not 
identify the causes for the disparity. 

The study used eight UC cam-
puses, including UCSD. It also 
quoted Marye Anne Fox, the 
newly appointed .:hancellor of 
UCSD, about her experience as 
one of only two women in her 
department at the University of 
Texas. 

"It was discouraging to know 
that when I went to Texas in 1976, 
I was the second woman in a fac-
ulty of about 50, and when 1 left in 
1998, they were again hiring a sec-

and woman," Fox stated. 
Donna J. Nelson, the study's 

primary author and an associate 
professor of chemistry at the 
University of Oklahoma at 
Norman, said that as the overall 
proportion of women in the coun-
try increases, their continued low 
percentages in these fields may 
mean that tho e most qualified to 
perform research will not be in 
positions to do so. 

"We can no longer rely on 
white males as the supply of scien-
tists and engineers," elson said. 

The report claims that the lack 
of female professors may also dis-
courage undergraduate students 
from entering the career fields, 
creating a self-perpetuating cycle. 

"Women have preferences and 
they make choices based upon 
their expectations of what will 
meet them in the labor market," 
said Maria Charles, an associate 
professor of sociology at UCSD. 

As a co-author of a soon-to-be-
published report on egregation of 
students in technical fields, 
Charles said she has found that the 
perception of discrimination or 
hostility toward women in specific 
fields may affect their choice in 
field of study. 

"There is much talk about 
'chilly climates' for women in 
these lcinds of firms - these so-
called male-dominated types of 
occupational cultures - which 
certainly affect preferences (i n 
choosing fields of study)," Charles 
said. 

The trend is present not only 
in the United States but all devel-
oped nations, she said. 

According to Charles, as tradi-

tionally female-dominated fields 
like nursing move beyontl the 
purview of profe sional and voca-
tional schools and gain acceptance 
in the upper echelons of presti -
gious higher education institu-
tions, a growing population of col-
lege-bound women choo e them 
for their degrees. 

Because women who are 
employed full time typically do 
the majority of housework and 
child nurturing, clements like 
time comminnent and parenting 
factor into their career choices, 
according to Mary Blair-Loy, 
UCSD associate professor of soci-
ology and author of "Competing 
Devotions: Career and Family 
Among Women Executives." 

At the same time, a new study 
by University of Pennsylva nia 
sociology professor Jerry A. 
Jacobs and graduate student Sarah 
E. Winslow concludes that 
putting in long hours is a key 
cause of dissatisfaction specific to 
academia. 

Jacobs' and Winslow's study 
aims to explain the relationship 
between gender equity in univer-
sity faculties and family compati-
biliry with an academic career. 
Since the average age of profes-
sors is just over 40, few can wait to 
tart a family until they reach the 

job security acquired through 
tenure, an issue that makes women 
more likely to work only in part-
time positions and be more dissat-
isfied with a job in university cir-
cles, according to the study. 

Nelson said such concerns 
about famil y and ca reer are an

Gender inequality in 
colleges unacceptable 

V arious studies, reports and data released 
recently On the issue 

of gender equity within 
hig-Iier education fields of 
sCIence and technology 
highlight cau es for con-
cern for academic commu-
nities that J?ride themselves 
on diversity and equal 
opportunity. 

The findings, based on 
data from the Office of the 
Registrar, the Office of 
Academic Affirmative 
Action and UCSD Health 

ciences Task Force, 
among others, show uneven 
gender distribution across 
academic departments. 
UCSD undergraduates and 
faculty are overwhelmingly 
male in the science and 
technology fields, and every 
academic dejJartment has a 
majority of male faculty, 
save one. 

UC D's newly appoint-
ed chancellor (the first 
female chancellor at 
UCSD), Marye Anne Fox, 
emphasized the lack of 
progress made in incorpo-
rating more women into 
the chemistry department 

at the University of Texas-
Austin. "It was discourag-
ing to know that when I was 
sent to Texas in 1976, I was 
the second woman in a fac-
ulty of about 50, and when 
I left in 1998, they were 
again hiring a second 
woman," Fox said. 

American universltles 
will not realize their full 
potential in science and 
technology if nothing is 
done to expand the pool of 
graduates in these disci-
plines to include more 
equal numbers of men and 
women. While some arg-ue 
underrepresentation is sIm-
ply the result of natural 
occupational choice, it is 
imperative thac women are 
provided with the tools and 
encouragement necessary 
to excel and compete in sci-
entific and technological 
fields with equal opportuni-
ty. 

Academic departments 
should act upon long-
standing inequality by com-
bating the problem through 
the recruitment and reten-
tion of women undergradu-
ates and faculty. 

Student input needed 
in CA budget deal 

Students who marched across the UCSD cam-
pus and on the State 

Capitol on May 18 had a 
good reason to be angry. As 
part of Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's May revi-
sion of the budget, UC 
undergraduate student fees 
will rise not just 10 percent, 
as expected, but up to 14 
percent. More importantly, 
this was part of the deal for 
higher education, called the 
"compact," that was struck 
between the governor, UC 
President RODert C. Dynes 
and CSU Chancellor 
Charles B. Reed. 

See anything missing 
from this picture? Try stu-
dents. 

This closed-door deal 
that didn't include a single 
member of the State 
Legislaure was made with 
no student representative 
present either. If including 
all campus student leaders 

was impractical, UC 
Student Regent Matt 
Murray would have been 
ideal to represent the stu-
dents' voices, as would have 
the UC Student 
Association, our own lobby-
ing group. UCSA and 
UCSD's Graduate Student 
Association both oppose the 
compact. A.S . President 
Jenn Pae, as well, has writ-
ten a letter to UC officials 
decrying the lack of student 
input. 

Students should have had 
a voice in a decision that 
impacts student fees, stu-
dent enrollment and finan-
cial aid. While it is too late 
for the university to fix this 
grievous error, it is not too 
late for students to make 
their voices heard to the 
Legislature, which will have 
the final say in ratifying a 
flawed budget proposal that 
left students out of the equa-
tion.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Watson should be 

proud of Triton Taxi 
Editor: 

I think it is sad that the UCSD 
administration does not want to 
align itself with a program such as 
Triton Taxi ("Watson opposes 
efforts to put Triton Taxi waiver 
online," May 13). Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson is quoted as 
saying "[Triton Taxi] is not a safe-
ty program. It is a program that 
encourages and facilitates stu-
dents getting into circumstances 
in which they are not safe." 
Watson sounds like those people 
who claim distributing condoms 
in schools encourages sex. Kids 
aren't having sex because con-
doms are distributed at school, 
condoms are distributed at school 
because kids are having sex. 
Similarly, UCSD students do not 
choose to drink because they 
know Triton Taxi can bail them 
Out. News flash for Watson: 
Triton Taxi exists because college 
kids drink, and it is better to have 
a viable option for getting home, 
because without it, people do stu-
pid things like get behind the 

wheel. More education is not 
going to help me learn how to be 
more "safe and secure." We all 
know the dangers of alcohol. 
Triton Taxi does not just help 
those who are being unsafe. Even 
if you are drinking responsibly, 
you still need a sober ride home. 
If your designated driver has 

" Triton Taxi exists 
because college kids 

d '11k " n ... 

ended up having a drink or your 
friend cannot come to pick you 
up, Triton Taxi is there. I think it 
is one of the best safety services 
offered. The UCSD administra-
tion should support this program 
and keep it running. They should 
be proud to support a program 
that provides safe alternatives for 
students.

Gender inequality 
chosen by students 

Editor: 
I am writing in regards to the 

article "Technical fields attract 
less female students" (May 13). 
As a simple statement of 
observed statistical fact, I took 
no issue with this report. As I 
read, however, I was perturbed 
by the ostensible insinuation that 
this disparity couldn't possibly 
be because some girls just hap-
pen to like nontechnical fields 
better. 

A5 a soon-to-be human devel-
opment graduate (listed as the 
worst offender in luring females 
toward the humanities), I would 
just like to take a moment to 
express my own views on the 
subject. Despite popular socio-
logical theory, my choice of 
major had little to do with a lack 
of scientific or mathematical 
encouragement dating back to 
my days in pigtails. On the con-
trary, I was awesome in these 
fields, if! do say so myself. I got 
a 5 on both the AP Chemistry

THURSDAY. MAY 20. 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Letters: Science programs not for every .. Sun God: the very 
best time of the year continutd from page 4 and AP Calculus tests. I was 

named Top Olympiad of the 
American Chemical Society in 
high school, and received a 
Student of the Year plaque for 
physics. I could go on, but I'm 
embarrassing myself, and I think 
you get the picture. 

The reason I chose not to 
enter an engineering program 
when I came to college was not 
due to lifelong discouragement 
or ingrained notions of what it 
means to be a woman; the reason 
I chose not to be an engineer was 
because I spent the summer after 
my senior year working at an 
engineering finn, and it was bor-
ing as all hell. Sitting at a com-
puter in my little gray cubicle 
surrounded by other little gray 
computer-filled cubicles made 
me want to poke my eyes out 
with my shiny new protractor. 

Don't get me wrong; I'm sure 
engineering can be interesting in 
its own way, and if that's what 
turns you on, hey, go for it. I just 
think it is a mistake to assume 
that all female Human 
Development Program majors 
would really rather be engineers, 
if this were a perfect world. 1 am 
HDP because I like HOP. 1 think 
if we're going to make a concert-
ed effort to up the number of 
female engineers in an attempt to 
solve this gender disparity crisis, 
as the article suggested, we 
should strive to up the number of 
male IIDP majors as well. And, 
for the record, we girls in human 
development do take the occa-
sional science 'class, as shocking 
as that may seem. A third of the 
HDP curriculum is biology-
based, ranging from genetics to 
neuroscience. J may not be blaz-
ing a revolutioary trail into th 
male-dominated workplace, but 

neither am I sitting at home knit-
ting booties and making pot roast 
for the menfolk. I am just a nor-
mal student, taking classes that 
interest me personally. 

I did not write with the intent 
to offend any engineers or femi-
nists or sociologists, or to brag 
about my nerdy high-school self. 
Nor did I intend to indicate that 
gender disparity in technical 
fields is not a genuine phenome-
non. I simply wanted to state that 
human development is just as 
legitimate and fulfilling a major 
as anything else, for members of 
either gender.

Fond memories of 
Children's Pool seals 
Editor: 

When I was a kid, one of my 
favorite places my mother would 
take me was to see the seals in La 
Jolla's Children's Pool ("Sealing 
their fates," May 10). It was a 
unique opportunity to see these 
creatures close up. Not once did I 
wish I could go swimminf there, 
as there are plenty 0 other 
beaches all over the county. 
Besides, that area was built for 
San Diego's 1931 population, and 
it would be unbearably crowded 
if it were reverted to human use 
today. 

So, my point remains, just 
beause kids ~re not swimming 
there does not mean they are not 
benefiting ftom it. Seeing the 
seals in the Children's Pool has 
Deen an integral part of growing 
up in San Diego and should 
remain as such.

Governor's cuts to 
UC not the answer 
Editor: 
This summer, a great debate is 

before us in Sacramento, a debate 
with serious implications for you 
as college students: Gov. Arnold 
Schwan.enegger has proposed 
more than $650 million in cuts to 
California's public colleges and 
universities, tuition hikes of 
greater than 30 percent for 
undergraduate students and 50 
percent for graduate students 
over the next three years, a 44 
percent hike in fees for commu-
nity college students, cuts to the 
Cal Grant program, and an $11.6 
million reduction in UC research 
funding. 

The Schwarzenegger adminis-
tration has also proposed to ask 
the UC and CSU systems to find 
"non-state resources" to fund 
most of its outreach efforts, 
which help disadvantaged stu-
dents compete for college - after 
slashing them by 50 percent ear-
lier this year. 

While there are many ques-
tions to be answered about how 
to solve the state's truly dire fiscal 
problems, I believe the choices 
before us are large.r than where to 
make cuts or raise revenues. The 
real question is whether the lead-
ers of this state will keep the 
commitment that our parents and 
grandparents made to invest in 
the next generation, or whether 
our dected leaders will shirk that 
commitment, to the detriment of 
your education and, I believe, to 
the future of our state. 

As treasurer, my first priority 
is to protect our economy today, 
and to build our economy for

Marianne Madden 

T he week of the Sun God festival is a tough time to write a column. My audi-
ence - an already surly student 
body - only cares to complain 
about the musical acts slated to 
perform, and to plan on the most 
efficient ways to procure, drink 
and then throw up as much alco-
hol as possible. Also, having just 
returned from a pre-pre-pre-Sun 
God party, I'm so wasted I can 
barely see. 

Sun God is exactly what this 
campus needs to help us survive 
the soul-sucking vortex that is the 
end of spring quarter - and to 
remind us that had we chosen to 
attend a school Iilce SDSU, we'd 
enjoy this sort of wild revelry any 
time we wanted, and even some 
times we didn't. 

The possibility of getting bust-
ed by the massive army of resident 
security officers, RAs, cattle-
prod-wielding administrators and 
the University of California's spe-
cially bred pack of rabid rottweil-
ers only adds to the fun. It 's the 
same thrill of getting caught that 
spurs us to speed 65 mph on 

streets teeming with children, 
newborn lc.ittens and snow-white 
unicorns, or to illegally download 
four million songs, or to have 
some "alone time" while staying at 
our parents' house. 

This we know. It 's a simple 
fight between good and evil, with 
alcohol as a fickle ally. 

But what I don 't know is why, 
year after year, no matter how 
careful and persistent the A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming is 
in booking musiql acts, we a/ways 
complain about how much they're 
going to suck. Whines of, "Awww, 
man, Busta Rhymes?" echo 
through UCSD's eucalyptus 
groves - nevermind the fact that 
we've been trying to book Busta 
Rhymes for years, and in previous 
years we whined, "Awwww, man, 
the concert's gonoa suck this year. 
If only they could actually get 
someone good, like Busta 
Rhymes

'
" 

This year there's the added cry 
of, "Goldfinger? God, they're so 
OVtT!" and, "The Moving Units?" 
OK, I have no idea what negative 
things people say about the 
Moving Units, but I 'm sure they 
find something to complain about. 
A typical pre-Sun God conversa-
tion goes like this: 

Student 1: "Awww, dude, I'm 
so excited about [musical act] ! 
They're gonna be so fuckin' 
weet!"

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Letters: State treasurer vows to fight governor's cuts to UC 
conrinlled from page 5 

tomorrow. I believe the gover-
nor's budget proposals for our 
public coll eges and universities 
take our state in rhe wrong direc-
tion - undermining our state's 
his tori c commitment to a first-
class higher educational system 
that provides opportuni ty to all 
Californians and that will be our 
ricket to economic progress in the 
decades ahead . What is truly 
troubling is that the governor has 
proposed sla shing state suPPOrt 
for higher education and hiking 
fees on students, while refusing to 
consider closing one corporare 
tax loophole or restoring the 
stare's income tax rates on the 
wea lth iest Cali fo rnians to where 
they were under Repu blican 
Gove rnors Ronald Reagan and 
Pete \Nilson. 

[n January of thi s yea r, I had 
the chance to tour some of our 
state's great UC, CSU and com-
munity college campuses. While I 
have always bel ieved that educa-
tion is an important investment in 
our sta te's economic strength, I 
came awa y from this tour more 
convi nced than ever of the impor-
tance of these great institutions, 
not only for the benefit they pro-
vi de our economy, but also for the 
opportuni ty and promise they 
offer the nex t generati on of 

Californians. In my opinion, we 
should be debating how we can 
invest more, not 

program. None of their parents 
had gone ra college, and all of the 

students III this 
program were 
working at jobs 

less, in our stu-
dents and III 
these institu-
tions, and in the 
future of our 
state. 

On my col -
lege tour, I met 
man y students 
who raid me 
that the ir 
dreams of 
attending our 
state's four-year 
universiti es 
simply would 
not be possi ble 
without the 
assistance, sup-
port and guid-
ance they 
received from 
the CSU and 
UC outreach 
programs the 
governor pr?-
posed 111 
January ra 
eliminate . At 
San Diego City 
College, I met 

" I believe the 
governor's budget 
proposals for our 

public colleges and 
universities take our 
state in the wrong 

direction-
undermining our 

state's historic 
commitment to a 
first,dass higher 

educational 
system ... II

Stale of California 

just to make ends 
meet. Because of 
the M.E.SA pro-
gram, Izzy Beth 
Rodriguez, Barry 
Cordero, Michelle 
Scott and Jovanni 
Sarria are poised 
ra go on to our 
great university 
system, to study 
biology, engineer-
ing and biomedical 
science, and to 
make their contri-
bution to 
California 's furure. 

Also in January, 
J visited 
McClyrnonds High 
School in Oakland, 
Cali f., a school 
where more stu-
dents drop out than 
graduate. There I 
met Antoine Davis, 
a . ttuly inspiring 
young man who 

with four students in the 
Mathem atics, Engineering and 

has defied the odds 
against him. Antoine not only will 
graduate this spring, but will do so 
as student body president, editor of Clence Ac hi evement outreach 

the school paper, and with a 3.7 
grade point average . Antoine says 
college outreach programs helped 
him to prepare for and apply to 
colleges. This fall, he will enroll in 
his first-choice school - UC 
Berkeley. 

We must ensure that our world-
renowned public college and uni-
versity system can continue to pro-
vide the opportunity for students 
like Izzy Beth, Barry, Michelle, 
Jovanni and Antoine - and tens of 
thousands more just like them 
across our state - to fulfill their 
dreams of mending college, where 
they can acquire the knowledge and 
slciJls they will need to excel in, and 
conoibute to a burgeoning 21st 
century economy. 

I plan to continue fighting to 
protect California's higher educa-
tion system and to maintain its 
legacy 3 $ an educational system 
that is worthy of your future . I 
urge you tdfo make your voices 
heard too, so that together, we 
can steer this debate in the right 
direction. E-mail or call the gov-
ernor and your legislators, and let 
them know that this fight is about 
more than dollars and cents - it 
is about your education and about 
the future of this great state .

Sometimes I think the people 
in charge of boo king Sun God 's

dollars and book a shitty local 
band - because students will bit· 
terl y compl ain no matter how 
much time and money is pent 
assembling a diverse playbill of 
reasonabl y popular and we ll-
known acts. 

And, best of all, we could put 
all the money we'd save by book-
ing Stevie's Garage Band toward 
more bouncy toys. Bouncy toys 
are , very simply, the soul of Sun 
God. The festival would be noth-

really no purer source of idiotic 
fun than tumbling down an inflat-

Now, to be responsible, I feel 
like I should put forth some Sun

don't get sellt to the hospital,

the students are organized and 
strong, sending the message that it 
is up to the Legislature and the 
administration to come through for 
their students and not allow public 
education to come to privatiza-
tion," Lopez said. 

The rally opened at Price 
Center Plaza with speeches made 
by representatives from each of the 
local colleges, after which the 
crowd began its march, carrying 
noise-makers and picket signs, 
through the Chancellor's Complex 
and on to the Villa La Jolla and La 
Jolla Village Drive intersection. 

"I was really disappointed that 
the administration didn't come out 
to voice any support for us," said 
Heather Flowe, vice president 
external of the Graduate Student 
Association. "[The budget cuts) 
will not only affect the cost of our 
education, but will impact the qual-
ity of our education as well." 

The "compact" will increase 
undergraduate student fees 14 per-
cent next year, instead of the 10-per-
cent increase proposed in January, 
totaling a 33 -percent increase in the 
next three years. Graduate student 

fees will increase 20 percent next 
year, with a IO-percent increase 
each of the following two years. 

"The way they're deciding to 
save higher education is through 
raising fees in order to gather funds 
for future years, so that we are the 
ones who are suffering," Lopez said. 
"The state is moving away from 
their promise of an affordable and 
accessible public education, and the 
lack of the governor's conuninnent 
to that promise is basically saying 
that it IS not their responsibility to 
raise these funds in the future." 

Eric Ferns, a member of the 
SDSU Stop the Cuts Coalition, 
said the cuts would hurt all students 
in higher education in the state. 

"This affects all levels of higher 
education - the UCs, CSUs and 
junior colleges," Ferns said. 
"Financial aid is going to be cut, 
which doesn't make sense because 
money is being taken from the stu-
dents, yet tuition fees are going to 
. " J!1Crea5e. 

According to Lopez. there are 
two plans that could serve as alter-
natives. One scheme. proposed by 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides, 
contains plans to close corporate tax 
loopholes, which will add S400 mil-
lion to California's income. Another 
bill, proposed by Assemblywoman 
Wilma Chan (D-Oakland), would 
increase higher education funds by 

~aising taxes for the wealthiest 2 
percent of the population. 

"There are two proposed plans, 
but the governor doesn't want to 
supp.on raisin, new revenue, which 

Billy Io'IonIIGuIInb 
TrIMc: ProtestelS marched from Price 
Center to the comer of La JoIa Village 
DriYe and Villa La Jolla on May 18. 
is funny because raising student 
fees can be seen as a way of raising 
student taxes," Lopez said. 

According to Flowe, the gover-
nor is not keeping to his campaign 
promise of balancing the budget 
without hurting education. 

"If you want economic prosper-
ity in the future, you have to invest 
in higher education now, at all lev-
els - UC, CSUs and junior col-
leges - because these are your 
future engineers and teachers and 
lawyers," Flowe said. 

Nandagopal said that the stu-
dents will be defended in court by 
the National Lawyers Guild to try 
to clear their records. 

Housing: Selection online for first time

reUirn calls seeking comment and 
Stacy Travis, a Hou ing and

In the paSt, studen ts signed up

times assigned by lottery. 

Under the new procedure, stu-

Despite these problems, Sze's 
current housemate, Muir sopho-
more John Perry, said he found the 
online selection method much eas-
ier in many respects. 

In spring 2003, Perry said his 
group came close to losing irs oppor-
runity to choose a place of residence 
because classes and bad driving con-
ditions kept several members of his 
group from attending their selection

would host two sessions during 
which those students would be given

Wraps: UCAB to accepr 
proposals for a replacement 

conlin~d from page r 
ested in soliciting their business at 
Price Center and a process of 
reviewing prices and menus. Star 
Wraps will nor be denied the RFP, 
and has the option of applying for a 
requesr to remain in business at 
Price Cenrer . 

"There's nothing that prevents 
Star Wraps from being considered 
in the process," Rarcliff said. 
"That's always been the case so far." 

Woo said he is considering the 
RFP to extend Star Wraps' renr, 
bur noted the difficulty in compet-
ing with other restaurants that will 
be applying for an RFP. 

"[Ratcliff] suggested we run for 
it, bur ir's kind of discouraging 
because, based on the secret shop-
pers, we're possibly being 
removed," Woo said. 

In a statement, Woo said Star 
Wraps experienced difficulties in 
upgrading kitchen facilities for 
their business. He also said that the 
secret-shopper results did not fully 
represent the entire UCSD student 
body, citing an average 20-percent 
increase in their yearly sales. 

"Seven out of 15 shoppers gave 
us fairly low scores," Woo said. "It's 
discouraging to think a small num-
ber of people are determining our 
fate. This is not a fair representa-
tion of over 20,000 students." 

Woo is considering alrering the 
current Scar \iVraps menu ro best 
accommodare students' needs. 

"r have worked here over six 
years and really enjoy serving the 
students and faculty at UCSD," 
Woo said. "We at Star Wraps care 
about what the students want." 

Food Commirree Chair and 
UCAB Chair-elect Jessica Kart 
suggesred keeping what Star Wraps 
already offers, bur adding addition-
al food alrernatives such as a wider 

---- ----- - - ~ -- ~- - - -~ 

yJ~~t~y-~6t~ 

vegetarian menu, freshly made sal-
ads, bowls and brown rice oprions. 

"We definirely want to keep rhe 
price down and keep it fresh and 
healthy," Korr said. "The people 
whom we got feedback from said 
they appreciate somedung that is 
eclectic and fresh." 

With the abundance of such 
franchise restaurants ar Price 
Center such as Subway, Wendy'S, 
Panda Express and Rubio's, UCAB 
members expressed the need for 
the presence of smaller, privately 
owned restaurants that provide 
diverse food alternatives for stu-
dents. 

The Food Committee is 
reviewing such "mom-and-pop" 
businesses, they said, as possible 
replacements. Tacone Wraps is one 
option being reviewed. 

"With something like Star 
Wraps or Tacone Wraps, you have 
a happy medium," Kart said. 
"They like students and they're 
always looking for contributions 
with ideas." 

Tacone Wraps, however, is a 
restaurant chain. 

Kart also noted that UCAB 
likes Tacone Wraps for its "bright 
and interesting menu" and versatil-
ity, citing the option of changing 
salads into wraps. 

"I think wraps would be nice," 
UCAB member Max Harrington 
said. "The big thing for me is [for 
students) to buy things for lunch 
under five bucks." 

The process of deciding on a 
possible replacement may extend 
into summer and a final decision 
into rhe end of fall quaner, accord-
ing to Kort. At present, t1r Wraps 
will continue to operate irs busi-
ness at least until the end of the 
quarter, according to UCAB offi· 
cials.

No joke, Busta Rhymes headlines festival 
'Woo hah!!' Hip-hop jester will bust out the party with crazy antics 

By DEENA AL SHAm 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

The whispered rumors are true: Busta Rhymes will be headlin-ing this year's Sun God festival. 
Arguably one of rap's most rec-

ognizable stars, Busta Rhymes got 
his S(3rt as part of Leaders of the 
New School, a hip-hop group he 
formed with three of his classmates 
(MCs Charlie Brown, Dinco D. and 
Cu t Monitor Milo) at Uniondale 
High School in Long Island, N .V. 
Right off the bat, the group grabbed 
a record deal with Elektra Records 

when Busta was only 17 years old. 
Their single "Teachers, Don't Teach 
Us Nonsense" brought tht:m popu-
larity in the underground hip-hop 
scene. The song helped Leaders of 
the New School gain respect, thanks 
to their Afrocentric philosophy and 
hard-hitting rap style. After releas-
ing rwo albums (FutTIre Withom Q 
Past in 1991 ; T.l.M.£. in 1993), the 
band broke up and Busta headed off 
to make it on his own. 

Following appearances on several 
projects with some of music's most 
well-known and respected artists 
(such as A Tribe Called Quest on 

"Scenario" and Craig Mack on 
"Flava in Ya Ear''), Busta appeared in 
the film "Higher Learning" in 1995, 
which helped him garner a solo con-
tract with Elektra Records. His first 
single, "Woo hah!! Got You All In 
Check," received mas ive airplay and 
made him a hO\l~ehold name. T he 
single also helped the success of his 
first album, Tbe Cunling, which went 
gold and hit the top 10. This success 
continued with 1997's When Disastn' 
Strikes, which debuted at number 
three. His early success has helped

If you're up for ska revival at un God, get your checkered shoes on and get ready to kank to the

'The Moving Units' dance-punk sizzles 
Band produces music you don't have to hate yourself for dancing to 

By BILLY GIL 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Another disco-punk band? Is that what we rea lly need, another throwback band with kitschy 
funk basslines and disco beats? 

Probably not, but don't hold that 
against the Moving UnitS. Fonning 
in late 200 I, the band quickly 

became a Los Angeles sensation, 
scoring big time with scenesters and 
critics looking for another Strokes. 
Their self-titled EP was released in 
2002 and became a college-rock 
smash. The dynamite "Berween Us 
& Them" was even played on L.A. 
rock-radio giant KROQ. It seemed 
a safe bet that the Moving UnitS 
would indeed be the next big thing.

Bronx brothers: New York transplants (lipse have had a turbulent rise to 
stardom. The rap duo will release their second full·length album this summer. 

BY nM SPULECKI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Brothers Malice and Pusha T together form the up-and-coming rap duo Clipse, who 
will be playing early at Sun God. 
Although they were born in the 
Bronx, the brothers relocated to 
Virginia in their early years and 
became heavily involved in the 
Virginia Beach, VA . area drug 
trade. Forrunately, they were also 
able to strike up a relationship 
with two relatively unknown pro-
ducers at the time, Pharrell 
Williams and Chad Hugo, also 
known as the Neptun·es. When the 
Neptunes hit it big, they took 
Clipse off the streets and into the 
studio to rap about the life and 
struggles that they had endured . 

Their first album was never 
released, mainly due to label trou-
bles, but the single, "The 
Funeral," which was released,

Staff Writer 

LOS Angeles quartet the Bronx will bring their hard-hitting brand of fiery punk rock to the 
Sun God festival with an early slot 
on the side stage. Like an angrier 
Rocket from the Crypt, the Bronx 
bring caffeinated tempos and brash, 
pol itical lyrics to. crunchy guitars for 
an energetic, intense and disti nctly 
Los Angeles take on modern punk. 

Mosh-pit lovers read: Show up 
for til is band to get your shove on, 
beca\lse they have fire. James 
'I\veedy, Joby ]. Ford, Matt 
Caughthran and J orma Vi k formed 
t.he Bronx in 2002 over an apparent 
lo\'e of fa t tempos and loud guitars. 
The band was Aooded with record

at a distance from the fast lane to

Limiting themselves to onl y 
three takes, the Bronx record all

friends' living rooms. They believe 
that this is the truest path to 
"music," shyi ng away from the mil-

lion-dollar srudi o environments 
other bands are supposedly record-

Tbe Bronx bristles wi th three

guitarist Gilby Clarke helped the 
band record parts of the album ,

he's bangi ng on a co lossal drum 
ki t, his kick/snare interchanges 
rising gloriously above the mix . 
Vocalist Matt Caughthran has a 
gripping scream, and we get to 
hear it a lot. His desperate vocal-
izations seem at the edge of mad-
ness, as if he were burning alive 
every moment you hear his voice. 

Most of the songs are just super-
fast three-chord numbers, but a few 
studio tricks elaborate the guitar 
and drum parts by providing con-
trary motion to particularly repeti-
tive parts. There's little variation 
between the songs, but we can let 
that slide - this is punk rock, after 
all , and no one in the pit cares 

about variation. But to their credit, 
the Bronx make attern ptS to keep 
things interesting with atonal 
detours up and down the fretboard 
to make us feel more strung out. 

While they certainly owe alle-
giance to the old world of hedonis-
tic L.A. rock 'n' roll, the Bronx 
thrash with a message. Many of 
their songs have political themes or 
purposes, and though their lyrics 
are of simple craft ("We 've got a 
cancer / Looking for the answer"), 
they're often very punk (like when, 
at th e e nd of "Heart Artack 
American ," Caughthran shouts 
"there is no revolution" repeatedly, 
as hard as his voice will let him) . 

The Bronx try to teal a bit of the 
Hollywood grime for themselves, 
and though It's not always clea r if 
they want to be Black Flag or G N' 
R, they do a good job of reca lling 
the sinful execs of the midnight 
boulevard and translating it into 
sound. TIle Bronx, like Los Angeles, 
are always in your face with some-
thing new for you to handle - and 
if you're up for it, as the denizens of 
that impassioned city will testify, the 
reward can be great. 

received mild success through 
radio airplay. Soon after, the 
N eptunes were able to start their 
own label, Star Trak 
Entertainment, and Clipse quickly 
went back into the studio to 
record a "brand new" debut 
album, instead of re-releasing 
their original debut. 

What emerged was 2002's Lord 
Willin', a catchy album about 
street life combined with commer-
cial beats courtesy of the 
Neptunes. Their lead single, 
"Grindin'," received heavy airplay 
on radio and the video was very 
popular on MTV and B.E.T. It 
was a throwback to the days of 
stripped-down beats to go along 
with a rapper's life story. The sec-
ond single was "When the Last 
Time," which also got heavy rota-
tion on radio along with TV and 
even became one of the biggest 
club songs of the year. 

Since then, Clipse have been 

relatively quiet, although they 
appeared on Baby's single "What 
Happened to that Boy" from the 
album Bird7Nl1l. During this time 
off, they have been actively record-
ing tracks for their new album, Htll 
Hath No Fury, which will also fea-
ture many Neprunes beats. The 
first single should be out in the 
near furure and will hopefully be 
previewed at Sun God. 

Clipse may not be as famous as 
Busta Rhymes in, but that's mainly 
on account of the relatively short 
time they have been working in 
the music industry. Give them a 
few more years and albums and 
they could very well receive top 
billing at similar concerts. They 
have had an interesting concep-
tion, and their style meshes partic-
ularly well with the beats that the 
Neptunes provide. Their music 
will get the party started right for 
those who show up in time to see 
them.

Bronx's Infemo: Los Angeles based punk band is sure to start the concert on 
an energetic note with political leanings, frantic beats and hard-charging guitars.

tapping your feet and head-

Busta: From pop to hip.,hop, 
artist is at home in all genres 

continued from p(lge I r 
cement his popularity: 2002's It Ain't 
Sofr No Mo' went to number ten on 
the Billboard R&BlHip-Hop Album 
Chart. 

But Busta isn't just musically tal-
ented: he's crossed over into acting. 
Playing in such films as "Finding 
Forrester,"" arc," and "Shaft," it's 
no wonder he's been called "hip-
hop's chameleon" by Rolling Stone. 

Musically, Busta's rapping style 
is qui.rky, aggressive and energetic. 
The tombination of his throaty, 
scratchy voice, fast raps, dancehall-
style beats (influenced by his 
Jamaican heritage) and raw hip-hop 
style have made him immensely 
popular. His award-winni ng videos 
match his musical approach -
edgy and striking. Along with his 
unique approach to hip-hop, Busta 
is con~idered to be one of rap's 
more groundbreaki ng artists, 
bringing both IOtelicct and excite-

ment to the genre. 
In addition to solo ventures, 

Busta has also joined forces with 
some of the top rap artists, working 
with Missy Elliot, Timbaland, P. 
Diddy, Dr. Dre, the Neprunes, 
Pete Rock and Snoop Dogg, 
among lIlany others. Aside from 
rap artists, he has also worked with 
other top artists that fall outside of 
the hip-hop genre; "1 Know What 
You Want" featured Mariah Carey, 
while "One" featured Erykah Badu. 
This versatility has helped him 
acquire a wide fan base. 

Don't expect to stand back and 
be bored this Sun God - watching 
Busta is an experience in itself. 
Whatever you've seen in his videos 
- color, energy, p eudo-insaniry 
- all comes to life on stage, mak-
ing him one lively entertainer. This 
exuberance helps bring a crowd to 
its feet - something that some 
would say is needed here at UCSD.

Dance: Promising band 
keeps post .. punk shaking 

continued from page I I 
appear to be yes. It's true that 
bands Ii ke the Rapture and Franz 
Ferdinand have claimed public 
affection in a way that the 
Moving Units could have, but 
this does not mean that there 
isn't room for more. The 
Rapture and Franz; Ferdinand 
have actually sold some records 
and have gotten on the radio. ' 
And the band who broke the 
mold for Gang of Four-style 
dancey post-punk, the Strokes, 
are more popular than ever, as 
are bands like the Yeah Yeah 
Yeahs and Modest Mouse. With 
a stop at Coachella and the fuJl-
length album fin'ally set for a 
summer release, the bands tim-
ing couldn't be better. 

Of course, the music itself is 
what should matter. In the case of 
the Moving Units, they deliver 
the goods. "Between Us & 

Them" begins the bands EP 
with a solitary guitar belting two 
alternating chords before a ham-
mering beat comes out of 
nowhere to keep the guitars in 
line. The effect is so potent that 
the rest of the song could suck 
and you'd be too busy dancing to 
notice. However, it doesn't suck; 
the song is a fine restructuring of 
minor-key post-punk into a hip-
shaking shuffle. 

The rest of the songs on the 
EP don't quite match the glory of 
its opener, but they have 
promise. "X and Y" sounds even 
more anxious with shrill vocals 
topping another loping bassline 
and slithery beat. It's nothing 
novel and the lyrics are inaudible 
or senseless, but these concerns 
are secondary to the "rock Ollt" 
factor. If the band doesn't rein-
vent the wheel, they at least keep 
it rolling with style.

rotation on the radio and televi-
sion waves. Goldfinger set off on 
whirlwind tours playing with the 
Sex Pistols, No Doubt and Reel 
Big Fish. They were also part of 
the Vans Warped Tour festival. 
However, the quartet didn't slow 
down in their musical production 
as they ground out their 1997 
Hllng Ups, which released to dis-
appointing record sales. The first 
single "This Lonely Place" didn't 
live up to the expectations and 
popularity set by "Here In Your 
Bedroom," but Goldfinger man-
aged to keep their heads above 
water by lending their cover of the 
Spiral Starecase song "More 
loday Than Yesterday" to Adam 
Sandler's "The Waterboy" sound-
track. 

In 1998, Williams left the band 
due to creative differences and 
Feldmann brought on fellow ex-
Electric Love Hogs' member 
Kelly Lemieux, who hawed up on 
Goldfinger'S next EP, a collection 
of live covers released in 1999. 
DOTTin's Coconut Ass: Live included 
punk, tongue-in-cheek remakes of 
the Cure's "Just Like Heaven" and 
the Who's "The Kids Are 
Alright." In the spring of 2000, 
Goldfinger relea ed their third 
full-length album, Stomping 
Ground. North America was intro-
duced to "Counting Days" while 
Europe was stormed by "99 Red 
Balloons" (another cover). That 
year, the band toured with Eve 6, 
Showoff, the Bloodhound Gang 
and Mest throughout Europe and 
the United Kingdom. Goldfinger 
liked the UK so much, they 
recorded a live record in Great 
Britain titled "Foot In Mouth" 
(only available at shows or 
through their Web site). 

In 2001, Goldfinger replaced 
recently departed guitarist 
Paulson with Unloco-alum Brian 
Author and record 1abel Mojo 
with JivelZoomba. Their fourth 
studio album, Open Your Eyes was 
released in 2002, followed by 
another grueling tour. Now let's 
recap the lineup: Brian Arthur 
(guitarist and ex-metal head), 
Pheiffer (drummer. and 
Canadian), Feldmann (bassist, 
vegan and original member) and 
Lemieux (guitarist and previously 
habitual band-hopper). The band 
recently went bade into the studio 
to prepare for their fifth release 
sometime in 2004. ]n the mean-
time, the band will rock Sun God 
with a nostalgic set of ska-punk 
originals and covers.

Candy: The 
way to Sun 

God is paved 
with fun 
continued /Tom /)ole 15 

dorms, typically reserved for more 
refined activities, house some of the 
best times during this day . 

All this strolling, meeting and 
greeting may work up an appetite, 
and candy isn't going to qudl that 
hunger so head to the Peanut 
Brittle House to get some grub and 
spirits. Poner's Pub, as it's known 
during the week, has all the beer on 
tap and food in flash·fryers one 
could need to re-energize. Take in a 
game of foosball then head on your 
merry way. 

On Sun God, look out for more 
than just hot spots. Be aware of 
who is walking around. The Evil 
Lord Licorice lurks in the form of 
Campus Security Officers who are 
on the prowl to thwart those that 
are having roo much fun. They, like 
the Evil Lord himself, have no 
souls and suffer from an ego trip, so 
no Gingerbread person is safe. 

Also meandering around cam-
pus are muddle-headed Grandma 
Nuns. While in the board game of 
Candyland, Grandma Nun is a lov-
able old coot, Nuns on Sun God 
are boisterous, obnoxious and slop-
py drunl.:. These Nutts, like the 
Grandma, aren't all there upstairs 
so try to kcep your distance. 

The Peppermint Stick Forest is 
near the end of the journey to 
Candy Castle. It is the glut of euca-
lyptus trees that stands just beyond 
RIMAC Field, but is a legendary 
gathering for those trying to 
squeeze in the last few moments 
before entering the gates of the Sun 
God concert. The Peppermint 
Stick Forest may be hazy at times, 
but if one forges through, Candy 
Castle is near. 

Once in Sun God concert, the 
journey is complete. The Imperial 
Bon Bon will take the stage, freak 
some people out, and then all will 
be well in Candyland. 

Daytime: 
Food, debates, 
religion are all 

at Sun God 
continwd /Tom PtIft 15 

stress-relieving big-glove boxing. 
Not into violent forms of stress 
release) Find the immaturity with· 
in you and grab your friends to get 
matching temporary tattoos at the 
Pep Band at UCSD table or go 
jump on the Astro Jump provided 
by Student Run Television. 
They're all located on Sun God 
Lawn - go and soak in your well-
deserved fun. 

Of course to top off the enter· 
tainment of Sun God festival there 
will also be many educational 
booths. Who needs to engage in 
big-glove boxing and eat lumpia 
when they can gain some very 
insightful infonnation on the Bush 
campaign? If you feci like you Just 
haven't had enough learning for the 
week, stop by the College 
Republicans at UCSD or Campus 
Greens booth to take pan in 
thought-provoking conversations 
and debateS. Or how about some 
religious cultivation? Check out the 
InterVanity Christian Fellowship, 
the Latter-Da,. Saints Student 
Association or the Campus 
Crusade for Christ tables to learn 
all about their reJjgions. 

It's May 21. Set your books 
aside, cnwl out of thOle black 
holes, enjoy a little bit of fun and 
sunlilht on this day, and go to the 
Sun God fativaI!

'Shrek 2' bursts with familiar humor 'Coffee and Cigarettes': 
a yummy, deadpan treat Likeable characters and can't-miss jokes make film a sure thing 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

After rescuing Princess Fiona and winning her away from a pint-sized Lord Farquaad in 
the origina l "Shrek," the surly 
green ogre marries the fair 
princess, but not after she trans-
forms into an ogre herself. Shrek 
(voice by Mike Myers) and Fiona 
(Cameron Diaz) may look like 
Garbage Pail Kid rejects, but 
they're madly in love and can't wait 
to retreat to Shrek's swamp to live 
happily ever after. Except that hap-
pily ever after must wait until 
Shrek meets his new in-laws, King 
Harold and Queen Lillian. 

Shrek didn't really think he was 
going to get away with getting 
hitched without meeting the in-
laws, did he? The honeymoon is 
over, and Shrek, Fiona and the 
motor-mouthed Donkey (Eddie 
Murphy) pile into a garlic-bulb 
coach for their trek to Far Far 

Away only to meet ridicule. 
The sequels plot doesn't live up 

to the exlla usting journey of the 
original, but Shrck must still prove 
his worth despite his beastly 
appearance and often-rude atti-
tude. The love affair audiences had 
with the main characters isn't pre-
sen t, nor is it as necessary, as the 
film relies heavily on visual gag 
humor to keep audiences more 
entertained with cheap thrills than 
character development. 

Plus, with sequels come new 
characrers. Prince Charming is 
himself a combination of Prince 
Valiant of "Spaceballs" and Gaston 
from "Beauty and the Beast," the 
good-looking hometown hero that 
is dreadfully arrogant and boring. 
His mother is Fairy Godmother, 
who is like Mary Poppins but with 
evil ulterior motives and a hanker-
ing for fast food. 

Fairy Godmother and King 
Harold plot against Shrek by hiring 
Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas),

REVIEW 

easily the most likable character in 
the film, to kill Shrek. Puss in 
Boots has a reputation as an ogre 
slayer, and appears an even match 
for Shrek upon their confrontation, 
but an unexpected hairball subdues 
the feline musketeer, and he imme-
diately becomes another sidekick, 
frustrating Donkey as the two 
compete for Shreks friendship. 
"The position of annoying talking 
animal," Donkey contends, "has 
already been taken." 

"Shrek 2" has more flash over-
all than the first film, but without 
being as refreshingly creative as 
the original animated fairy tale 
spoof was in 2001. Like the origi-
nal "Austin Powers" movie, 
"Shrek" fascinated the audience 
largely by satirizing its genre suc-
cessfully and making hilarious 
allusions to pop culture. And like 
"The Spy Who Shagged Me," 
"Shrek 2" forces the same SO" of 
jokes to the point of overkill. 

The moral to this fairy tale 
also appears more elementary 
than the first, but the filmmakers 
can rest happily ever after on piles 
of cash k.nowing the movie's 
humor will attract an ogre-sized 
box office draw.

Offbeat humor and star-studded cast 
abound in Jarmusch's latest film 

By CUFFOID HILO 
Staff Writer 

Director Jim Jarmusch's ("Dead Man," "Ghost Dog") latest film, "Coffee and 
Cigarettes," is full of household 
names, including Cate Blanchett, 
Bill Murray, Roberto Benigni, 
roclcers Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, 
and even the RZA and the GZA of 
rap troupe Wu-Tang Clan. By 
blending these famous personas 
into caricatures within a non-nar-
rative series of vignettes concern-
ing the titular coffee and ciga-
rettes, Jarmusch tempers an irre-
sistible pop appeal with his wacky, 
deadpan humor. 

There's a basic setup to the 
film: varying medium and close-
up shots of the foregrounded 
characters, an overhead shot of 
the usually checkerboard table-
cloth, a subtle baCkdrop of modest 
jukebox music, and, of course, 
coffee and cigarettes. 

Layered over this minimalist 
setting is the conversation. The 
characters quarrel, banter, discuss 
and theorize as if they don't really 
want to be talking in the first 
place. They pontificate on every-
thing from Elvis Presley's evil 
twin-brother to the mechanical 
nuance of Tesla coils . Keep in 
mind that though the actors are 
playing themselves, they really 
aren 't. When Bcnigni ("Life is 
Beautiful") introduces himself as a 
coffee-addicted Roberto, his spa -

Film 
REVIEW 

tic, jittery hands and dogged smile 
give way to a pure spoof of his 
public persona. 

Among these clever self-paro-
dies, a few of the conversations 
stand apart in their hilarity. One is 
when Blanchett meets up with an 
old cousin (also Cate Blanchett) at 
a press junket, where hostile jeal-
ousy can barely be contained . 
Another is when Waits suggests 
that Iggy Pop is more of a "Taco 
Bell kinda-guy." And finally, the 
last vignette, starring veteran 
actors Taylor Mead and Bill Rice, 
suggests an emotional poignancy 
in their talk of coffee as cham-
pagne and Mahler's aria, "I've 
Lost Track of the World." 

It's refreshing to know tha t 
Jarmusch is also letting down his hair 
and having fun with the film, instead 
of piling frustrated "deeper mean-
ing" atop the audience. So, sit down, 
talee a sip, have a drag, pur down the 
book, relax with Bill "Ghost-Bustin" 
Murray, and have a good time.

plan and at least it is a positive plan." 
However, some Regents believe 

that agreeing to a compact now 
would compromise support for 
increased funding for the universi-
ry in the state Legislature. 

"I think that ... the cenainry and 
stabiliry that this compact brings is 
deeply in question," said Regent 
Fabian Nunez, who is also the 
speaker of the California State 
Assembly. "I say that with no 
offense to President Dynes, 
because r think he has done the 
very best job that he possibly could 
to negotiate the best deal given the 
circumstances. Does it weaken our 
position? My view is that it takes 
the wind Out from under the sails of 
those in the Legislature who are 
looking to more adequately fund 
higher education." 

Student Regent Matt Murray, 
who also opposed the proposal, 

raised concerns that the agreement 
would also stifle lobbying effortS 
for better funding. 

"We've started a great advocacy 
campaign in this university," 

" , " the certainty and 
stabiUty that this compact 

brings is deeply 
. ." m queStlOn.

UCrepnt 

Murray said. "Our alumni, our stu-
dents, our administration have been 
... working together in Sacramento 
amazingly this year. I would hate to 
see that pulled back because of the 

delicacy of the negotiations." 
UC Student Association Chair 

Matt Kaczmarek, who addressed 
the Regents during the public com-
ment period, opposed the compact, 
saying that the agreement did not 
sufficiently address accessibility to 
the universiry, student fees or 
financial aid. 

"For the thousands of students 
who have worked hard for 12 or 
more years to become UC-eligible, 
but were not admitted this year, 
this compact was imply a public 
acknowledgment that the governor 
and the Universiry of California 
have together failed the people of 
California," Kaczmarek said.

Gender: Report claims women earning less

important reason why undergradu-
ateS need female role models to 
discuss their hesitations about pur-
suing academic jobs. 

"I hear from young women all 
the time that they want to see 
female professors and talk to 
them," she said. 

While the need for family time 
has affected both male and female 
faculry, compensation dispariry 
remain a problem for women, 
according to an annual report 
issued by the American 
Association of University 
Professors in Apri I. 

The report noted that, national-
ly, women received a salary of 88.4 
percent that of their .male counter-
parts at the full professor level in 
2003-04. It noted smaller gaps for 
associate and assistant professors, 
at 93 percent and 92.3 percent, 
respectively. 

"These percentages have been 
remarkably stable o'·er the past 15 
years," the report stated, noting 
that many factors were responsible 
and that the AAUP would take a 
closer look at the factots in next 
year's study. 

By comparison, a 2002 campus-
wide report found that female fac-
ulry at UCSD on average receive 
5.6 percent less in pay for a nine-
month academic year base salary 
and 12.5 percent less in overall 12-
month compensation than their 
male counterparts. 

Nelson's report did not address 
pay irregularities. 

Though underrepresentation of 
women in technical fields is a 
national phenomenon, Nelson 
said, she believes that each institu-
tion must design individual solu-
tions. 

"When it gets right down to it, 
it's going to be change within the 

department," she said, uggesting 
workshops targeted at individual 
department chairs that would 
increase sensitivity for the concerns 
of faculty and student and create 
"hospitable" environments. 

In addition, Charles believes 
that increasing mandatory general 
education requirements for under-
graduates would help move women 
into currently isolated fields of 
study. 

"Giving boys and girls more 
choices about what courses to take 
probably exacerbates segregation," 
she said. "If you require a certain 
amount of math or science of 
everyone in a beJief that this is a 
nece sary part of ones education, 
and at the same time you require 
humanities and supposedly ' female ' 
fields by exposing people to these 
things, there is a chance you'll find 
that they'll overcome some of these 
barriers and stereotypes."

solid ideas for improving the 
office of student advocacy. Shmidt 
sa id that he plans to increase the 
office's visibiliry, enend services 
to graduate students and work 
more closely with the Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs 
Office. 

"My goal is to increase visibility 
of the office because, accordi ng to 
the UCSD Student Conduct Code, 
the student advocate is the only one 
that can represent students in actu-
al hearings, so I want to make sure 
that all students have that opportu-
niry," Shmidt said.

He said that he is also in favor of 
appointing A.S. commissioners 
because of the duties that are 
required of them. 

"r truly believe that all commis-
sioners should be appointed 
because the commissioner has very 
specific duties," Shmidt said. "I 
don't go in there to make anybody 
happy, I go in there to defend the 
students that need to be defended ." 

Shmidt also said th.at making

Four run

"We were also really close to 
Brian," Goker said. 

In fact, they were close enough 
to bet their coach on two separate 
occasions that they would win a 
National Championship - and 
win both times. 

"He has a tattoo of a Triton on 
his arm now," Poma said. "And he 
had to rent a kilt and wear it to our 
banquet the other time." 

With the titles, awards and 
attendance records, no one can 
question the Tritons' abiliry and 
drive to win. The only question 
that seems to remain is: How can 
the team cope after losing so many 
great seniors? 

"The transition is tough," 
Wensel said. "I thinle they'll do just 
as well as we did." 

"My advice would be not to sec-
ond-guess the traditions," 
Mendoza said. "Those traditions 
could range from tattOOing your 
coach to winning championships. 
Either way, somehow there is a Iinle 
between the two that maybe only 
the team could understand." 

For now, the nine seniors will be 
content with the legacy they are 
leaving behind, one that would be 
di fficult to beat in any sport.

Water polo: Camaraderie aided strength of team 
continutd from page 24 

Samara Silverman's old mark of 
86. 

Lombardo completed her 
arduous comeback afrer taking a 
redshin year and reclaimed her 
spot in between the pipes. Her 
5.59 goals-against average was 
among the best in the Western 
Water Polo Association and her 
238 saves in 2004 was the fourth-
best single-season performance. 
As a backup, Corn ford didn't see 
much playing time, but managed 
to amass a 1.50 goals-per-game 
average. Her experience, however, 
was key to the effon. 

"Andrea [Cornfordl didn't get 
a lot of time, but she contributed 
outside of the pool... she had a 
strong role in being a team mem-
ber," Sanders said. 

Bounds saw a lot of action at 2-
meters while splitting the position 
with freshman Natalie Hockett. 
Bounds scored II goals in 2004 
and her 42 ejections drawn was 
the second highest on the ream. 
K1eidon, a utility, saw 84 quarters 
of action, racking up 20 steals as 
well as three goals in 14 attempts. 

Coming together as a team was 
a challenge for the squad, but their 
efforts culminated in another 
WWPA runner-up finish. Still, 
the experiences along the way will 
be dear to the Tritons. One, in 
particular, was a trip to Michigan 
to open the season. 

"We showed our experience in 
the cold by wearing flip-flops 
when we arrived," Bantilan-Smith 
said. "Larry was wearing shons. It 
was the first time a lot of us had 
seen falling snow, but we were 

" Each individual 
had something 
to contribute, 

and all of these 
contributions helped 

create team 
chemistry. " 

freez.ing ... it was negative 12 
degrees!" 

These seniors loved to tickle 
their funny bones with hijinks, 
especially at team retreats. 

"We'd play this game where 
the c~ches separated the players 
with blankets, and when they 
dropped them, you had to say the 
other person's name as fast as you 
can," K1eidon said. "The problem 
was we couldn't do it. You'd see 
them and know their name but 
your mind would stumble and 
we'd laugh at each other." 

It was all business in the pool, 
and the seniors reveled in beating 
rival UC Davis twice, especially 
after the Aggies cried foul in the 
WWPA seeding. 

"Davis thought that they were 
better than us to get second seed-
ing, even though we had beaten 
them, because of their higher 

record," Bantilan-Smith said. 
"Then we went out and kicked 
their butt by four ... they were in 
it for the first three minutes and 
part of the third quarter, but we 
were still up by five ... it was awe-
some." 

The hours and commitment 
were demanding for the seniors, 
who spent the better part of each 
week with each other, but they 
will miss some perks. 

"Being tan in winter was great 
.. . people would ask if we did 'fake 
and bake' - no, we're ali-natur-
al," K1eidon said. "I sure do hate 
the tan lines the Speedo suit gave 
us." 

Now that practices are over, 
players miss spending time with 
each other. Even seeing each 
other an hour or two out of the 
day isn't enough. 

"I miss seeing the girls every 
day ... we run into each other and 
I have some in my classes, but its 
not the same," Lombardo said, 
voicing a sentiment shared by the 
other seniors. 

"I'll even miss hell week!" 
Bounds ~aid, referring to the 
intense conditioning that takes 
place in the first week of the sea-
son. "As much as you hated it, 
we'll never have that experience 
again." 

As graduation approaches, 
each senior has plans. K1eidon will 
rum a love for animals into a 
career as a wildlife veterinarian, 
after a possible trip to study bono-
hos in Africa. Comford plans on 
obtaining her Ph.D. in a biologi-
cal science and doing research. 
Bounds will be married on July 31 
and will study either massage 
therapy or physical therapy. Her 
teammates boasted of her prowess 
in massage and took advantage of 
her back-cracking slcills anytime 
they could. Lombardo will pursue 
a graduate degree in healthcare 
administration with the ultimate 
goal of running a hospital. 
Bantilan-Smith plans on taking a 
year off.

ca": UCSD to recruit athletes 
'who fit the academic profile' 

conrinlUd from page ~4 
of players Carr and his staff will be 
looking to recruit. When asked 
about how he will address the lack 
of athletic scholarships being 
offered to potential recruits, Carr 
said he is confident that he and his 
staff will find the right players for 
UCSD. 

"[My staff and II are going to 
work hard and get out and find the 
right athletes who fit the academic 
profile of this university," he said. 
"I know they're out there, and r 
certainly know they're out in 
California. We'll find people who 
will want to compete at a high level 
- both academically and athleti-
cally - and I thinle that's how we'll

Carr also said that he would like 
to add more height to the lineup 
and intends to recruit taller players 
for the upcoming season. The bas-
ketball team will graduate one 
senior in June, guard Cameron 
Jacbon. Carr will have time this 
spring to get more acquainted with 

the players. 
"I cenainly want them to all 

come back," he said. "Hopefully 
through the end of the school year 
this year, they'll give me a chance 
to coach them ... find out if it's for 
them or not. And then, we' ll make 
a decision in the summer." 

At a March 10 press conference, 
Edwards announced that UC D 
would not rehire former men's bas-
ketball coach Greg La IIthier. 
Rather, he expressed a desi re to 
find a replacement that would 
enhance the existing program. 

"Basketball needs to be a high-
profile sport, and we'll be looking 
for someone, preferably with head 
coaching experience, who ca n 
build on the foundation that we 
have in place," Edwards said. 

UCSD men's basketball is the 
only nonscholarship program of its 
lcind in NCAA Division II and 
competes in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, 
one of the premier Division 11 con-
ferences in the nation .

Five women poloists conclude UCSD tenure 
Tritons make progress through season of rebuilding 

By DANIEL DiAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Hawaiian, the stalwart 
goalie, the comeback student and 
the transfers all came to UCSD 
for a similar opportunity: to be 
given a shot to play the highest 
level of women's water polo. 
They congregated at the begin-
ning of the 2004 season without 
much experience, but progressed 
to storm the upper echelons of 
collegiate water polo. 

UCSD women's water polo 
seniors Meris Bantilan-Smith, 
Andrea Corn ford, Rachael 
KJeidon, tephanie Lombardo and 
Lesha Bounds move on from the 
sport, they have no regrets about 
being defeated in the conference 
champIOnship title game, and will 
always remember how they came 
together to become good team-
mates and even better friend . 

"Thi group was one that had 
to come together," UCSD head 
coach Larry Sander said. "Each 
indiVIdual had something to con-
tribute, and all of these contribu-
tions helped create team chem-
istry. They all had the ability to 
work hard and left it all out in the 
pool ... there were no individuals." 

As a Division II school, U D 
boasts top-quality academic and 
athletics without the allure of 
cholarships. Despite paying for 

theIr own education, the non-
cholar hip opportunity afforded 

the five seniors a fair chance to 
play water polo without being 
overlooked because they didn't get 
full fides. 

'" realized that I would be able 
to play and be around people that 
were playing for the sport, not 
money," Bantil:t'n-Smith said. "We 
could have gone to scholarship 
schools, but we wanted that 
opportunity to show what we're

capable of." 
Bantilan- mith and Corn ford 

joined the team in 200 1 straight 
from high chool. A a native 
Hawaiian and the only non-
Californian on the quad, 
Bantilan- mith had to accustom 
her elf to the variable climate. 

"Meri [Bantilan-Smith] didn't 
own a pair of pants until she came 
to an Diego, and he was mad 
that she had to wear shoes all the 
time," Corn ford aid. 

Bantilan- mith aw extensive 
time from the start, averaging 
134.5 quarters in each of her first 
two years. Lombardo and Bounds 
transferred in the following sea-
sons from Golden West Junior 
College, a powerhouse among 
two-year schools. Right away, 
Lombardo claimed a starting spot 
in goal, amassing a 5.43 goals-per-
game average in 2002 before sus-

taining a torn houlder labrum and 
bicep that kept her out of the pool 
for a season and a half. 

"I couldn't move it much or 
throw forward, much less swim," 
Lombardo said in an earlier inter-
view. 

Corn ford took on the starting 
job for the re t of the season, play-
ing 64 quarters and allowing a 6.5 
goals-per-game average in the 
cage. . 

KJeidon, a water polo player in 
high school, had dropped the sport 
in favor of her studies, but after 
three years could no longer resist 
the urge to get back in the pool. 
Her strong swimming helped her 
land a place, but she was chal-
lenged in recapturing her game 
sense. 

"It was hard acclimating back 
into polo," K1eidon said. "I had no 
idea what I was doing when I was 

going for balls, but Larry took a 
risk in giving me time to get my 
skills. " 

By 2004, the five seniors took 
the reins. Besides perennial starter 
Bantilan-Smith, the team was low 
on experience because the core of 
the team from the previous four 
years graduated after the 2003 sea-
son. Whatever challenges lay 
ahead, however, the girls knew 
they were going to do it together. 

"They were like your instant 
frier;d ," Bounds aid of her team-
mates. 

As the most experienced player, 
Bantilan-Srnith anchored the team 
on both sides of the pool, racking 
51 goals for the season and 138 for 
her career. Her 87 steals in 2004 
constituted a new record, nudging 
past roommate and 2003 graduate

Women's soccer bids farewell to nine seniors 
Class of national champs represented majority of Triton starters 

By ALAN McBROOM 
Senior Staff Writer 

As the 2003-04 sports season 
winds down at UCSD, it's a proper 
time to look back at the athletes 
who have given four years to their 
respective programs and will not 
be able to don the Triton blue and 
gold for another go-around. Many 
senior student-athletes with great 
individual accomplishments will be 
sent off this year. Yet no group of 
seniors has been more decorated, 
victorious or vital to its team than 
the nine seniors from the women's 
soccer squad. 

They were nine of the regular 
starters anchoring the best starting 
lineup in the 2003 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
Over the past three years, these 
nine have combined for five A11-
CCAA First Team selections, six 
on the Second Team, two 
lIonorable Mentions and one 
CCAA MVP, while helping coach 
Brian McManus to two CC/\A 
Coach of the Year honors. They 
went 4-for-4 in CCAA 
Championships and brought home 
two Division n National titles. 

Molly Carlson and Christine 
Wensel secured the defense in 
front of goalkeeper Kami Poma. 
Kristin Jones, Shannon Harrelson 
and Kristen Conahan finished past 
overmatched opponents. Amy 

Goker, Sarah Schopbach and 
Megan Mendoza controlled play in 
the midfield. 

"I would like to give the seniors 
a big thank you for taking UCSD 
into Division n and bringing home 
two National Championships," 
McManus said. "The women's soc-
cer program is a better program for 
having you all play and represent 
the school. Yes, we should have 
won it this past season, but I guess 
it was in the stars not to be." 

They had the skills and a mag-
nificent coach, but one could hard-
ly doubt that their success was 
equally a result of these nine play-
ers sticking together for so long. 
With majors ranging from com-
munication to biochemistry, from 
management science to anthropol-
ogy, it was a diverse group. 

"It was difficult to connect as 
freshmen," Wensel said. "But by 
the time we were seniors, we knew 
each other so well and all nine girls 
had such skill, we could just place 
the ball at each other's feet." 

The previous accomplishments 
of the program were also factors in 
their success. 

"The tradition and legacy goes 
way beyond us," Mendoza said. "It 
helped us buy into the system we 
were playing, and believe in it." 

"You don't have to be friends 
with your teammates, but we were 
all friends - on and off the field -

and it definitely helped," Goleer 
said. 

The camaraderie extended off 
of the field. From polka dancing in 
the "Seniors" van on road trips, to 

partying in Miami Beach after 
their first NCAA title, the group 
clicked well together.

Head coach 
meets the 

press 
Carr discusses 

future ofUCSD 
basketball 

By CYNTHIA _LADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

UCSD Director of Athletics 
Earl W. Edwards announced Bill 
Carr as the new men's basketball 
head coach in a press conference at 
RIMAC Arena on May 17. 

Carr described his opportunity 
with the Tritons as a "gold mine." 
He emphasized focu ing on the 
advantages of the UCSD basket-
ball program and ensuring that his 
players make an influence on and 
off the court. 

"Everything is in place here to 
be successful, and that's exactly 
what I intend to do," Carr said. 
"We're always going to talk about 
what we do have, the plu es of 
being at UCSD. We're going to 
talk about the people that are in 
the program. I told the [playersl, I 
come here to win, and that' what 
we're going to do. We're [also] 
going to be representatives of the 
university off the court." 

Carr said that he had the 
opportunity to meet the team and 
tudy tapes from the past season, 

which the Tritons finished with a 
9-18 conference record . He felt 
positive about what he has seen 
and highlighted the style of play he 
wants to implement. 

"It was refreshing," Carr said. 
"[The players] got into the work-
outs, and they picked things up 
really quicldy. They're more ath-
letic than people thinle they are. 
We are going to pressure [the 
opposition]. And on the other side 
of the ball, we're going to make 
sure we pass it around. Everyone is 
going to get a chance to touch it 
and shoot it. There are certainly 
going to be roles for each of the 
guys on the team, and 'we'll make 
that perfectly clear." , 

Carr brings with him 14 years 
of coaching experience. He was the 
associate head coach at Long 
Beach State the past two years and 
from 1999 to 2002, he served as 
the head coach of Spring Hill 
College in Mobile, Ala. Carr 'went 
84-23 (.785) at Spring Hill and 
coached the Badgers to three 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics 
Tournament appearances. In addi-
tion, he garnered the Gulf Coast 
Athletic Conference Coach of the 
Year honor for his inaugural season 
at Spring Hill in 1999-2000. He 
began his coaching career at the 
University of San Francisco, where 
he spent nine years as assistant 
coach. He helped lead the univer-
sity to the 1998 NCAA 
Tournament after it won the West 
Coast Conference Tournament 
Title. 

His 14 years of coaching experi-
ence will be an asset to the basket-
ball program, . according to 
Edwards. 

"His strong interpersonal skills 
and contacts in northern and 
southern California for recruiting 
will help us tremendously and revi-
talize our basketball program," 
Edwards said. 

Athletes who excel on the court 
and in the classroom are the type
