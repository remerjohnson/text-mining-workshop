Game Time Favors 
Western Teams 
STA ORO. Calif. - Past 
research indicates that in many 
S\>Orts, an athlete 's peak 
perfonnance occurs in thl.: late 
aftemtxJn and early evening. 
Using this infonl1ation. Roger 
Smith 01 Stanford ni\ersity ' ~

a hypothesis that in M nday 

ight Foothall games hctween 
teams from the we!.t and ea~t 
coast. . the western teams have 
an advantage because tll'~y play 
closer to their peak athletic time. 
Smith discovered that by 
consistently betting on west 
coast teams over the past 25 
years, he correctly picked the 
winner 68 percent of the time.

SclenUst Hopes to 
Sell flying c.s 
LONG BEACH, Calif. - The 
first flying car to be seriou Iy 
considered for the consumer 
market is being developed by 
CSU Long Beach researcher 
Gunnar Clausen. Although the 
concept of an acrocar has 
existed since 1917, no such 
vehicle has ever made it to 
market. Clausen says he hopes 
to have his car finished and 
ready for sale by 2005. The 
aerocar will be 18 feet long, 
weigh about 3,000 pound, and 
have a top peed of about 200 
miles per hour. Both a pilot 's 
and driver's license will be 
necessary to operate it.

DC to Consider Race, Gender Criteria 
ADMISSIONS: Judge 
blocks Prop. 209's 
implementation 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

fleet federa l judge Thelton 
Henderson 's Dec. 23 ruling that sus-
pended enforcement of Proposition 
209 - the highly controversial 
measure that bans race- or gender-
based preferences in state govern-
ment and state-fu nded, higher edu-
cation. 

"We will endeavor to do every-
thing possible to avoid further 
changes during the admissions 
cycle," Atkinson wrote. noting the 
importance of processing the appli -
cations in "a timely and deliberate 
manner." 

Backer said he anticipates ad-
mitting 13.000 of' the 28.700 stu-
dents who have applied to UCSD, 
and that he expects 3,000 tudenis 
to ultimately enroll for classes in 
fall 1997. 

Based on summer 1995 projec-
tions, up to 1,261 students could be 
affected by the elimination or affir-
mative-action criteria from admis-
sion decisions, Backer said. 

UC President Richard Atkin on 
recently instructed campus chancel-
lors to continue using racial, ethnic 
and gender criteria in considering 
the 70,000 high school and transfer 
students who have applied for fall 
1997 admission to the universi ty . 

Atkinson's Dec. 26 orders re-

Atkinson directed the nine chan-
cellors to continue using pre-Propo-
sition 209 standards and policie to 
make undergraduate admissions and 
financial-aid decisions. barring an 
emergency stay of Henderson's in-
junction by a federal appeals court. 

Campus admissions offices have 
been receiving applications since 
the beginning of December, and 
UCSD Vice Chancellor for Enroll-
ment Management/Regi trar Rich-
ard Backer said the first admis ions 
decisions willlikcly be made by the 
third or fourth week of January.

UCSD Police Chase Errant Driver From 
Torrey Pines Gliderport to Point Lorna 
EVASION: Relatively low- peed 
pursuit winds through La Jolla, 
Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

AlmoM before he knew it. what was supposed 
to be just another routine traffic stop for UCSD 
Police Officer Michael Jone turned into a 21 -
mile- long car chase from the Torrey Pines 
Gliderport to Poi nt Lorna. 

Jones said he wa~ patrolling the Gliderport at 
about 9:55 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 20, when he 
spotted a car parked in the bu~hes. When he went 
to investigate, Joseph Monit - a 32-year-old 
unaffiliated with the university - started the car 
and drove off without turning on hiS headlights. 

Jones followed the car along Torrey Pines 
Scenic Drive - noting that Monit still hadn ' t 

turned on hi s lights afler about a quarter or a mile 
- and attempted unsucce1>~rully to stop the silver 
Mazda. 

Jones said he was suspiciolls because the 
Gliderport is rrequently a drug- and sex-re lated 
trouble spot at night. 

"Anybody in the Gliderport at that tllne of 
night , you kind of suspect they're doing some-
thing they probably shouldn't," he said. 

Jones sa id he saw Moniz reach out his window 
and rub his fingers together several times. 

"The guy was probahly doing something runny 
there, and that's why he didn't pull over," he said. 
"I thought he might be dumping dope out <?r the 
car." 

Monit turned onto North Torrey Pines Road 
and again onto La Jolla Shores Drive, which he 
followed into La Jolla. Moniz turned onto Pros-
pect Place and then onlO La Jolla Boulevard. He

Congress 
Bolsters 
Financial Aid 
INCREASE: I04th 
Congress' final actions help 
more students afford college 
By Naomi Falk 
Staff Wffter 

Shortly before adjourning for the year, 
the l04th U.S. ongress joint appropria-
tions committee approved a $3.5 billion 
increase for federal student-aid programs in 
fiscal 1997-98. The program will provide 
financial assistance to 8.2 million college 
students. almost 900,000 more than in 1996-
97. 

The Pell Grant and Work-Study pro-
grams received the greatest increases. The 
Pell Grant program, which provides assis-
tance to 3.6 million low-incortle college 
students. will receive $6.413 bi Il ion - a 
$676 million increase over 1996-97 leveb. 

President Bill linton has committed to 
obtaining an increase of thc$616.5 million 
earmarked for federal Work-Study programs 
by $2 13.5 million. 

Other federal aid programs also received 
substantial funding increases. However, the 
supplements were largely restorations of 
runds cut from the programs in the previous 
year. 

The Perkins Loan program received an 
increase of$64.7 million . The Direct Lend-
ing program was bolstered by $55 .3 mil -
lion, and the TRIO grants program grew 
by $37 million. The State Student Incen-
tive Grant program - which provide~ 
matching federal funds for Ca l Grant~ -
recei ved a $20 mi II ion increase above 
1996-97 levels . 

UC Office of the President (U OP) Stu-
dent Financial Support Director Kate Jefrery 
called the increase in funding "the largest 
increase in the higher education budget In a 
quite a few years, and certainly a tep in the 
right direction." 

"Every increase in federal funding helps 
to make the university arfordable," she 
added. 

Students and ·tudent organizations played 
a pivotal role in facilitating the increase in 
financial aId funds through their lobbying 
efforts.

the 

Society Has No Right to 
Prohibit Free Expression 

By Mar y Higgins 
Senior Staff Writer 

In front of a government 
hulldmg, a thmng of angry 
<lctlv"t, Mand, around a burn-
ing flag, chaming se lf-right -
eou~ly a~ t hc yard~ of red, 

whlt~ and hluc bunting arc 
annihilated by the d~~tructi vc 

t\lnglle~ of lire. Tomurmw, ,I 
Vldnam vcteran will pick lip a 
n~w~paper and look at photo> 
of thi s ~cene, perp lexed and 
angered by the ac t of rebel · 
lion. 

Against what arc these 
flag -burners possibly 
rehelling'l America' s unique 
justil.:e system, which provide~ 
the accused with a chance to 
defend themse l ve~? Our soci· 
ety in which women may 
appear 111 public wi thout wear-
II1g ~tit1ing rohe~ and vc il~ 
ovcr their heads? A country in 
which chi ldren arc born with 
the frecdom tu choose t hClr 
own religion '! 

Basic civi l rights that 
Americans possess - and 
often take for granted - are 
not typical of our world . 

Compared to our oppres~ed 
and impo vcmhed counter-
parts across thc globe, tho~c of 
u ~ who arc shehered in the 
arlm 01 the U nited Swte~ 
don ' t'have too much 10 com-
plain about. 

Americans enjoy an unusu -
al degree of freedom because 
we live in a democratic soci -
ety hased upon the 
Constillition. Our freedom is 
guaranteed because the Bill of 
Rights mandates that indi Vid-
ual liberty is to he respected. 

With freedom, however, 
comes responsibi lity. 
Freedom mean s that SUlY 
Greenbelt can hold a public 

as~e mbl y and lecture for 
hours on the merits of protect-
ing the humMing owl. On the 
other hand, ~he also ha~ the 

n:~p()n ~ ibIIIlY to accept that 
her opponent Sam 
Lumberjack may abo distrib-
ute pamphlet~ on the nece~ i-
ty of dear-cu tting forest s in 
the Northwest. 

Sometimes peopl e say 
things that we'd rather not 
hear. When I walk across cam-

pu~. /'m constantly has~ led by 
people wJving rctition ~ and 
religlOu , brochure~ in m)

messages offensive , bul. .. 

Last month a group of 
UCSD students hurned an 
American flag at a pro test 
again.t Proposition 209 and 
received front -page coverage 
from the Guardian . Whil e 
some st udents approved of 
thi s act. others ignored it. Still 
other individuals were out -
raged by II. At least one com-
munity member, who say~ he 
is a Vietnam veteran, has chal-
lenged those who participated 
in the protest to a debate in the 
Price Center. 

Personally, I was little si ck-
ened when I sa t in the 
Gllardian's producti on room 
and printed out a copy of the 
front page. The photo that ran 
on Dec . 2 showed tive stu -

Flag Desecration is an Attack on OUf Country's Ideals 
By Nate Pietila 
Opmion Editor 

"Fire: everal members of the 
MIII'illlil'nlll Eswdialllil Chil'll/lll dl' 
A:llall (MEChA) group watch as an 
AmeriClIO flag bums on the ground. 
The llrouP was protcsting the P,lS-

~age of Proposi tions 187 and 209, 
which they consider raci st attacks." 

Regulilr readers of the GlIlmiiall 
will have lillie trouble recognil.ing 
this a~ the caption attached to a 
front -page photograph in our Dec. 
2. 1996. is.ue. The picture depicted 
half-a-doLen or .0 . mirkmg stu-
denb protestmg alifornia'~ recent 
move to eliminate affirmative 
actIOn . 

Although there is some questi on 
whether the students In the photo 
were actually enrolled at UCSD, the 
message that these MEChA mem-

hc r~ were trying to wnvey was very 
clear: By approving Proposition 
209, Californians arc denyi ng equal 
rights 10 women, people o f color 
,lIld ot h~r minorities who need and 
dese rve prcferenlial treatment ; 
therefore , we denounce your non-
ex istent commitments to equality 
and ju.tice, ideals which arc sup-
po:.edly represented by your flag. 

ot having taken a poll amund 
campus, I'm not sure how many 
people had time to get upset by thi s 
photo, what with all the ~tress that 
10th week inevitabl y brings. 
However. after having had time to 
rdlcct on this incident over wmter 
break, I tind myself incensed at the 
audacious nonchalance of the Ilag 
hurners. 

The Supreme Court has ruled 
that burning the American nag is a 

consti tu\Jona ll y protected form of 
free speech. In 1989, the coun ruled 
in Texas II. Johnsoll that states can-
not prosecute people for burning 
the American nag. 

Similarly, in 1990 the court 
ruled unconstitutional a federal 
statute - the Flag Protection Act 
- that was s('Imewhat broader in 
scope than the one invol ved in the 
Texas case. In U.S. I ~ Eic/IIllUIl . 
Justice Brennan, writing for the 
majori ty, ·tated that "punishing des -
ecration of the flag dilute the very 
freedom that makes thi s emblem so 
revered. and worth revering." 

Justice Brennan notwithstand-
ing, you don't have to be a rocket 
cientistto reali ze that reverence for 

our nag - the symbol of our coun-
try - is at a low surpassed only 
during the era of Vietnam. 

Looking back at the photograph 
of the MEChA protest. one thing 
immediately jumps out at me: the 
scornful , yet pueril e, grins of the 
desecraters. At least for these par-
ticular MEChA protesters, burning 
the flag is 'ome kind of political 
joke made at the expense of the 
Constitution and the principles it 
embodies. The last thing these pro-
testers exuded was any kind of 
political ea rnestness. Flag-burning 
was merely their fashionable way 
of givi ng the government "the 
bird." 

For all the Supreme Court's 
rhetoric about it , duty to protect the 
First Amendment, the legacy of the 
court" flag -desecration decisions is 
manifested in the lack of gravilas 
on the part of the MEChA protest-
ers. Flag burning is not now, nor 

wi ll it probahly ever be. the ulti -
mate act of political defiance. 

As Justice John Paul Stevens 
wrote in hi s dissent in Eichmun, 
"what makes thi s case particularly 
difficult for me i what I regard as 
the damage to the symbol that has 
already occurred as a result of this 
Court's decision to place its stamp 
of approval on the act of flag burn-
ing. A formerly dramatic expression 
of protest is now rather common-
place ." And the price of this "com-
monplace"? The denigration of our 
mo t important national symbol. 

Flag burners could quite easily 
get thei r messages a(;ross in other 
ways, at a much lower cost to the 
prestige of "Old Glory." Whil; not 
all flag burner have the same agen-
da - some might be protesting our

OASIS ADDRESSES PROPOSITION 209 CONCERNS 
Editor: 

On ovcmber 5. 1996, the 
majorit y of California voters (54 
percent) approved Proposition 209. 
a misleading initiative de igned to 
eliminate affirm ati ve action and 
other effons that challenge white, 
male privilege in puhhc insti tutions 
such a~ UC D. 

A ~ wift response was disseminat-
ed from the 'niversity of 
Cali tiJrnia's Office of the President. 
headed by Rich rd Atk inson. 
Despite the UCOP\ unfortu nate 
necessity to implement Proposition 
209, President Atkin~on '~ directi ve 
also contai ned hopeful words for 
those of us who remain com mitted 
to equity in opportuni ty and out-
comes in hi gher education. 

Among President Atkinson 's 
more encouraging words was his 
assertion that. "diversity is an asset 
to California and can on ly be 
achieved by ex tending educational 
opportunity to disadvantaged young 
people." We interprct tlicse words as 
an institutional ad.nowlcdgment 
that the most critic<ll clements of 
campus diversity lie 111 the degree of 
access and bcnctit ~ available to 
tllO~e who have hl~lorically hcen, 
and who remain, di~advantaged by 
racism, classism. ,exi sm and other 
forms of oppression and domination 
in our society. 

Thu~. UCSD retains an impera-
tive to ensure eqult~ lor ~uch indi-
viduals and groups vho have occu-
pied subordinate JX'. 1I10n ~ in our 

institution. The UCSD Offiee of 
Academic Support and Instructional 
Services (OA IS) has as its mis ion 
to "help all UCSD students reach 
their full potential through develop-
ing their appreciation for learning 
and thei r abi lity to learn eO'cctively" 
Also embedded in the OAS IS 
Mission Statement is the acknowl-
edgment that "Although OAS IS 
se rves all students, promoting cdu-
cati onal equity is specifica lly part of 
it s mission. Recogni zi ng the com-
plex historica l, economic. and psy-
cho·socia l factors cn tering into 
under-representation and overall 
lower levels of acadcmic achieve-
ment of certain ethnic groups in 
higher education, OASIS giws pri-
ority for its services to students who 
are members of ethnic groups 
IlIlderrepresellled at CSD. By 
doing so. OASIS contributes 10 the 
university elTort to elimi nate acade-
mic performance differel1l.:c~ related 
to ethnicity, socIOeconomic back-
ground, or admi~si()n status" 
(empbasis added).

of implementing this priority with-
out u~ing cthnicity, race, or gender

Counsel James Holst stated in a 
OCI. 4 letter to the chancellors that 
such an action "essentially means 
moving up the timing of compli-

The American Civil Liberties

MONEY: PeJl 
Grants get largest 
increase since ] 970s 
Continued from page 1 

·Vice President Sarita Gupta 
''Through student lobbying and the 
building of a grass-roots campaign. 
USSA and coali tion members were 
able to win a $3 .5 billion increa C. " 

The increase in funding for the 
Work-Study program translates to a 
35 perccnt increase over la t year. 
According to Jeffery. the Clinton 
administration intends to back leg-
islation designating half of the in-
crease in Work-Study funds for fun-
neling college students into com-
munity-service jobs, with a particu-
laremphasison tutorial positions in 
elementary and secondary local 
schools. 

However, Jeffery said the cre-
ation of so many new work-study 
posi tions may be an issue. Com-
munity organizations wi ll be re-
quired to provide funds matching 
those they receive from the fed-
eral government to support these 
students. Many of the organiza-
tions lack the funds necessary to 
match the federa l monies. How-
ever, primary schools are not re-
quired to provide any fundi ng. 

The increase in funding for the 
Pell Grant program wi II mean an 
overall increase in each student's 
award. whether a part ial or fu ll grant. 
The Pell Grant a student can receive 
wi ll increase by $230 to $2.700, the 
largest increase ince the mid-
1970's. 

UCOP officials have indicated 
that students' ti nancial-aid packages 
will be larger in I 997-1}8 . However, 
individual chancellors will have the 
discretion to decide between increas-
ing t he number of students recei v-
ing grants and increasing the amount 
of money allocated 10 students al-
ready receiving grants. 

In 1994-95, 37,400 UC students 
received Pell Gmnts. That same year, 
3,800 UCSD students received par-
tial or fu ll Pell Grants - meaning 
that regardless of how it is spent, the 
increa e will affect a large propor-
tion of students on campus. 

Jeffery noted that even as late as 
last year, discussions of federal aid 
programs centered arounddefunding 
and dismantling them. 

oo A year ago they were talking 
about gUlling the programs, leffery 
said. "This is a dramatic turnaround, 
something to be very pleased about." 

Student leaders said that although 
thcy were enwuraged by the news. 
thcy were concerned thc money 
would not be sufficient to meet stu-
dCllls ' needs.

Atkinson Strikes Affirmative 
Action Deal, Effective 1998 
By Ivan Defy.nthal 

Bowing lo pressure from bOlh 
Gov. Pete Wilson and members of 
the UC Board of Regents, UC 
President Richard Atkinson 
announced Tuesday that 
affi rmati ve-act ion-endi ng measurcs 
will first take effect for students 
app lying to the Universi ty of 
California for Spring Quarter 1998. 

Atkinson unveiled a plan which 
sought to postpone Ihe affinl1ative-
action cut until Jan. I, 1997, so that 
slightly relooled admission ' policies 
would initially affect students 
seeking admission to Ihe University 
of Califomia for the fall of 1998. 

Atkin~on justified the delay by 
saying il would take longer than 

expected to notify community 
members, college counselors and 
tudents about the University of 

Califomia's new admission policie . 
While the new implemenlation 

date represenls a compromise 
bel ween Atkinson and the regents, 
UCSD admissions official s 
indicated that the most recent date 
scI by Atkinson is more of a 
symholic gesture because of the 
relalively few number of 
admissions for Spring Quarter. 

While implementalion of SP-I 
for undergraduate studenls wi II 
take effect beginning in spring 
1998, implementation for graduate 
and profe~s ional sludents will be 
effeClivc for the fall of 1997.

In response to a rcquest initialed 
by the 1993-94 Associated 
Sludcnts (A.S.) council, the Office 
of the Regislrar Issued new 
personal identificati on (PID) 
numlx:r, in Novemhcr. 

The Registrar altered lhe 
student-identification system from 
one based on Social Security 
numhers ( SN ) to random nine-
digit numhcrs. 

' 'The new studenl-idenlification 
system is a good idea," Vice 
Chance llor for Enrollment and 
Management/Regisl rar Ri c hard 
Backer said. "If there is any way 
that we can protect Ihe privacy of 

" \tudenl~, we will do so. This is a 
major step." 

The new ,y~ tem is the result of 
an agreement made In 1994 
bctween the A.S . and the reglslrar\ 
olTlce. Students had complained 
thal Ihe university ', use of SS , 
made them vulnerable to fraud and 
invas ions of privacy. 

Students can use either Ihelr 
PID or 5S to rcglstcr for classes 
over the telephone.

UCSD Women 's Center under the 
joint sponsor hip of the offices of 
the Senior Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs, the Vice

administration to fund [the 
Women's Center] in the face of 
the California Civil Rights 
Initiati ve and the regents' decision 

Ito repeal affirmative actionl," 
said Nancy Loevinger. lhe 
Center's director. 

Loevinger crediled former 
Inlerim Chancel lor Marjorie

gender issues affecting UCSD 
sludents, faculty, staff and the

The evenl entitled 
"Mohilil.c Against the Lies" -

wa~ organiLcd to rally opposition 
to RI and was spon:.ored by 
several students organil.ations. 

Jackson opposed the propo ition, 
attacking whal his opponents call a 
"wlorblind" policy. 

"We need a stale thaI is \.:o lor-
inclusi ve and color-caring, not 
color-blind," Jackson said. "No 
rational person wants to be hlind." 

In addition. Jackson called on 
the audience to become educated, 
united volers. 

"You musl educate yourselve ' on 
the lic~ of Propo ition 209, and not 
allow them to play on your fears," 
Jackson said. "Whenever Young

WHAT WAS YOUR WORST CHRISTMAS GIFT? 

I don 't think I've ever 
had a bad Christmas gift. 
You know, I don't mind 
fruit cakes, either, because 
it's the spirit of giving. If 
someone makes something 
and makes it in their own 
kitchen, and slaves over it, 
then I feel flattered to get it 
no matter what it is.

I got this box where you 
put coins in and if you 
push a certain thing, a 
plastic hand comes out and 
grabs the coin or some-
thing like that. J used it for 
a day or two and then 
tossed it into the closet. It 
wasn't very practical. I 
didn ' t have much use for 
it.

One time J had a case of

Charter to Open in 1997 
By Christina Rhudy 

Marshall College Provost and 
Charter School Steering 
Committee Chair Cecil Lytle 
hosted a forum to di cuss the 
planned UCSD Charter High 
School and ways students can get 
in vo lved in the project before the 
school's sched uled opening in fall 
1997. 

Initial planning for the schoo l 
began in July 191)2 when the 
CaliFornia State Senate passed 
S.B. 1448, the Charter School Act. 
UCSD began informal di scussion. 
with local offi ciab concerning the 
project in winter IY93 . 

According to the school's 
mi~sio n statement, a main goal of 
the projec t is to "provide an 
intensive college-preparatory 

environment for low-income and 
other hi stori cally under-
represe nted student populations 
at the University of California." 

The schoo l will be a public 
high sc hool on the UCSD 
campus, and students wi II use 
UC D classrooms and facilities . 

According to project 
coordi nators, the school's 
curriculum is based on three 
pril'ciplcs - excellent teachers, 
small classes and a strong 
curricu lum. 

Lytic also ~ t ressed the need to 
creatc an institution such as the 
charter high school in the "post-209 
environment," and that the UCSD 
community h3.'> a moral and soc ial 
responsibi lity to help the school 's 
~lUdents achieve their goals.

ACLU 
Sues UC 
By Meera Pal 

To halt the UC system 's 
implementation of Proposition 2(1), the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
(ACLU) filed a class-action suit against 
the UC Board of Regents on behalf of 
all current and future UC students. 

The lawsuit comes in the wake of 
San Francisco Federal Judge Thchon 
Henderson's ov. 27 decision to 
issue a temporary restraining order 
(fRO) that bars the enforcement of 
Proposition 209 at the state and local 
level. If Henderson had not issued the 
TRO, Proposition 209 would have 
taken effcct immediately.

However, th is i a team that has 

championship of their own tourna-

batt le with Clark University forthird 
place. Clark' sdefensive scheme wa 
similar to Lake Forest's, and the 
Tritons knew that they had to find a 
way to crack it in order to win. 

They passed the test. Yamasaki. 
Poehler and Bayda were ready for 
the pressure thi time, and played 
with great poise. Behind their ef-
forts , the Tritons ended 1996 by 
claiming third place with an 7-72 
victory. 

The fir t game of 1997 fo r 
UCSD was quite interesting. They 
traveled to La Verne, which is no- . 
toriously known for it s alm os t 
comicll i home-court advantage. 

"We ca ll it the c ircu tent ," 
Poehler sa id, "The roof is actually . 
made out of tarp and looks like a

because their noor isn' t made out

come together, looking much more 
confident and contro lled than the 
team that was taking so many 
punches earlier in the season. 

"We need to take it one game at 
a time; we have a shot at beating 
every team," Aune said, who, 
along with Sebek and Thimgen 
wa an All -Tournament election 
at the La l alla Classic. "It just 
depends on how we shoot and how 
the ba ll bounces." 

Maroutso echoed the optimism 
of this resi lient team of fighters. 

"I Reaching the tou rnament] is

ing." 

can jump higher on it, but if you 
fallon it hurt s so much wor e than 
a hard wood floor." 

II might sound fu nn y, but it is 
always di fficult to play in the 
'tent'; UCSD found that out in last 
year's loss. Earl y on, it looked as 
if they would 10 e again as La 
Verne started fast. 

The Leopard went into the 
locker room at halftime withaone-
poin! lead. By the second half, th~ 
Tritons were accustomed to the 
awk ward setting and began to play 
up to their potential. They rode a 
17-poi n t performa nce by 
Yamasaki to a 71-63 wi n. 

UCSD has a tough schedule 
coming up, but they are play ing 
well, and feel they're ready IOcon-
quer the worst part of their sched-
ule. If the Tntons do prove to be 
road warriors. it will be a great 
spri ngboard for the playoffs, be-
cause the Tritons wi ll have to wi n 
on the road during the tournament.

Walsh Awards 
for Excellence 

Now that the UCSD fall 
~ports sea on has come to an 
end , I think that it' s lime for 
the first annual Walsh Awards 

" . for Triton Athletic Excellence 
- Fall Edition. So here they 
are: 

Top Performance by a 
Team. 

Women's Soccer. 
If there was any such thing 

as a no-brainer, this was it. All 
that you have to say is back-to-
back. To be national champi-
ons just once is an enormous 
feat, but to repeat the title run 
with a revamped roster of new 
superstars is amazing. Triton 
Head Coach Brian McManu 
has built a dynasty that has 
placed fear in the eyes of 
Division 111 coaches acros the 
country. If UCSD ever does 
make the jump to Division II 
competition, I don ' t think that 
the women's soccer program 
will have too much of a 
problem adjusting. 

Top Coach.

Tritons Break 
Off Six Wins 
OCCUPIED: UCSD's men played nine games 
over the winter holidays, improving to 9-6 
By Kevin MclaUChlin

Last time anyone checked, the 
men 's basketball team was a team 
on the ropes. The Tritons had just 
suffered a huge blow, losing 
the services of veteran point 
guard Adam Libby for the 
season, and the team ap-
peared to be wobbling at the 
knees as they lost three 
straight heading into finals 
week. 

"We had time to readjust over 
the break - I don ' t think we can 
play any better than we are now," 
Triton Head Coach Greg Lanthier 
said. 

However, the men were -----

During the four-game 
winning streak, UCSD beat 
California Lutheran, ranked 
17th in the country in Divi-
sion III; Gustavus Adolphus

Thimgan, score 40 points each;

the finals of the La Jolla Classic 
last Saturday night at RIMAC 
Arena.

.. coaching in a tougher situation. 
Entering his first eason of 
coaching in a program with a 
tradition of excellence, 
McFarland took over a team 
that performed below expecta-
tions last ea on and led them 
to the NCAA Quarterfinals. 
Competing against probably . 
the toughest schedule in 
Division IJI, which included a 
number of long road trips, 
McFarland helped the squad 
overcome a number of injuries 
and put together a record of 
24-7. 

Boosted by the return of junior 
guard Mark Sebek, who has taken 
over many of the point guard re-
sponsibilities, the men have turned 
things around. Before a heart-
breaking los to NAIA school 
Southern California College last 
Saturday, the men had won four 
contests in a row against quality 
opponents. 

The Tritons battled SCC tooth 
and nail in a game that saw numer-

McFarland also re(;elves the 
award for the most athletic 
performance by a coach, after 
putting together a fine race in 
the Chancellor's SK. Buoyed 
by a late charge, McFarland 
fini hed just slightly behind

This one was very hard for 

me to decide because each 
team had a candidate worthy of 
winning. After carefully 
considering, however, I finally 
settled on the one-two 
combination of Ele Johnson 
and Lauren Johnson. These 
two unrelated forward 
anchored the offense for the

Let 's ge t ready to rumble! 
After a nlcc holiday break that 

i neluded an emotional victory over 
Poi nt Loma, a long 
hom stand and an 
adventure under a 
cirCUS-lent , the Tri -
ton Women's Bas-
ketball tea m now" 
faces a merciless 
sc hedule that will 
have them playing 

on the road for II out of their 14 
remaining regular 'eason games. 

This itinerary has them playing 
throughout California, butthe vic-
tories garnered during the break 
that Head Coach Judy Malone 's 
squad gave them momentum as 
they head into the fire . 

The stretch began on Friday 
December 6th (w hich in UCSD 
terms was the last day of (inals). 
with an emotional victory over 
cross-town rival' Point Loma. 

Th e Crusader came into 

RIMAC arena on a mission to beat 
the Tritons. Their last few meet -
ings have been extremely close, 0 
close in fact that buzzer-beaters 
have been the di fference an more 

than one occasion. 
This game continued that trend, 

and although the lead changed 
hands seemingly countless times 
down the stretch, the Tritons gut-

defense and clutch free -throw 
shooting. 

They couldn ' t ce lebrate for too 
long however. because they had 
Redlands the next night. Unfortu -
nately for the visi tors, the UCSD 
women were obviously in a great 
rhythm, and dispatched the nor-
mally stubborn Bulldogs. 

Then came the mixed blessi ng: 
a 21 day layoff for the Tritons. The 
players had to be ex hausted from 
final s and a harsh, extremely phy~i ­
cal and intensely emotional string 
of game, and definitely deserved 
a break. 

But they were playing great bas-
ketball , and despite the fact that 
they would continue to practice 
throughout the break, there was 
concern that a long drought of 
games would level out the waveof 
momentum. 

Tell that to Jersey City State, 
the Tritons' first round opponent 
in the UC San Diego Invitati onal.
