UCSD Alumnus Chosen as Regent 
• Fonner UCSD A.S. Vice President Alex Wong selected 
to represent student concerns as Board of Regents member 
By ...... SneI 
Senior Staff Writer 

After months of searching, the University 
of California Board of Regents announced 
Tuesday thai 1990 Third College alumnus and 
UC Berkeley graduate tudent Alex Wong 
will be the university's 1992-93 tudent re-
gent 

lbough officially a representative of UC 
Berkeley's BoaIt Law School, Wong i the 
first UCSD-related tudent regent ince a 
UCSD tudent was named to the position in 
1981. 

"1ltere are nine campuses, and they all have 
to be represented," UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson said. "But it's a great thing to have 
a student regent from UCSD. I'm very pleased." 

"I feel a sense of relief, excitement, and 
happiness," Wong said "But I also recognize 
that it's going to be a heck of a challenge- the 
UCsy tern is indirestraits right now. It won't 
be an easy job, but it's been something I've 
been hoping and training for ... for a long time." 

4I'm absolutely thrilled," UCSD Student 
Government Advisor Randy Woodard said. 
"Even though Alex i n't officially represent-
ing UCSD ... I count Alex as one of our own. 
He's our favorite son." 

Woodard cited Wong's experience as both 
a UC undergraduate and graduate student as

one reason why he is uniquely qualified for the 
po ition. 

"He went in with both perspectives, both 
from profes ional school and his [undergradu-
ate work]," Woodard said. 

"The student regent is upposed to be an 
expert on tudent experiences," Wong said. "I 
don't expect to have the answer to every prob-
lem. but one thing the student regent can 
contribute is ... to discus the student experi-
ence, and speak. as an expert on what students

UCB Considers 
Price Center 
Shuttle Stop 
• Proposal may cost $22,()()(); 
student fees would pay one-third 
By Richard Wachter 
Guardian Reporter 

A proposal that would alter campus shuttle 
routes to include a top behind the Price Center 
has once again been brought before the Univer-
sity Center Board (UCB), which has twice 
before voted it down, aCcording to University 
Center Director Jim Carruthers. 

The proposal calls for re-routing shuttles to 
tum off Voigt Drive onto Matthews Lane. 
which leads up to the campus police station and 
the east side of Espresso Roma. The shuttles 
would stop at the Price Center, tum around, 
return to Voigt Drive. and continue on the 
campus loop. 

According to Carruthers and UCB Chair 
Molly McKay, the problem with the proposal 
is that there i not enough room for the huttle 
to tum around at the end of Matthew Lane 
without backing up. Liability considerations 
do not allow shuttle drivers to drive in reverse, 
even for the purpose of turning around. 

In order to put a stop at the Price Cenler. the 
street would have to be widened, several small 
tree would have to be removed, and a fire 
hydrant would have to be relocated. all at a total

ParkingTask Force suggests Campus Improvements 
• Recommendations emphasize alternative transportation, suggest reducing the cost of student spaces 
By .,.. Gebler 
Staff Writer 

The temporary Task Force on 
UCSD Parking and Transportation 
Issues has made ten recommenda-
tions toCbanceUorRichard Atkinson 
for the improvement of the current 
UCSD parking and transportation 
planning policy. 

During this quarter, the repon 
wiu be discussed and reviewed by 
campus parking and transportation 
authorities, and the recommenda-
tions may become official UCSD 
policy as early as spring quarter, 
according to a letter on the subject 
from Task Force Chair Frieder 
Seible. 

The task force report, which was 
released on Jan. 10, is based upon 
the research conducted by the task 
force during the 
fall. 

In formulating 
their recommenda-
tions, the task force 
produced geneml 
policy tatements, 
ralherthan specific 
plans or proposals, 
because of time 
constraints and because the San Di-
ego Air Pollution Control District 
(APCD) delayed issuing new regu-
lations which could affect UCSD's 
potential parking policy. 

The task force emphasized the 
use of alternative transportation, and 
recommended the expansion of 

shuttle, carpool. 
vanpool and mass 
transit programs, 
and the expansion of 
paths, parking and 
locker/shower facili-
ties for bicyclists. 

The recommen-
dations are aimed at 
achieving an envi-

ronmentally responsible plan for 
parking and transportation by re-
ducing the number of single-occu-
pancy vehicles on campus. 

At the same time, they are a 

reminderthat expensive nearby off-
campus housing and in~~equate 
mass transit make it difficult for 
UCSD students to walk, bike or bus 
to campus. 

The current vehicle occupancy 
average i 1.3 peoplepercardriving 
to campu daily. 

The recommendations also call 
for reforming the Parking Advi 'ory 
Committee by reducing the size 
from 14 to nine voting members. 
which according to the report will 
make the comm ittee more efficient. 
At the same time, though, the com-
mittee must maintain a balanced 
representation of students. staff. fac-

Russian Historian Teaches UCSDSociologyClass 
• Students say Soviet studies class goes beyond historical theory 
By MeIndl! HamItan 
Senior Staff Writer 

"It's Russian thought explained first-hand." 
said MuirCoUege senior and History major Ian 
ComeD. Connell, like other students in Sociol-
ogy 188E, is learning about Russia through the 
life experiences of his instructor, Vladimir 
Kozlov. 

Kozlov, a historian from the Russian Min-
istryofEducalion'sInstituteofNationai Pr0b-
lems of Education, is te8ching the sociology 
class this quarter through an arrangementengi-
neered by Sociology Professor Tim McDaniel, 
who currently serves as the Education Abroad 
Propam's liaison in St Petersburg. 

Kozlov wiD teach the first five weeks of the 
course, and then Gennady Bordiugov will fin-
ish the coone. Kozlov heads the section of the 
Educadon Institute studying the history of na-
tional and ethnic conflicts in Russia, where he 

works with Bordiugov, who.has not yet arrived 
from Moscow. 

"It was a nightmare," McDaniel said, de-
scribing the arrangements required to get 
Kozlov and Bordiugov and citing problems 
with communication and transmitting docu-
ment~ . Tn addition to the political chaos in 
Rus. ia. the ituation was complicated by inef-
fici ent pnst office, telephone and telegraph 
systems. 

Despite the problems, Kozlov arrived in 
time to teach his first class of Winter Quarter. 
Although he speaks English well enough to 
conduct lectures, Kozlov said that the lan-
guage sometimes presents a barrier. 

"You use many words which we did not 
learn at the university," Kozlov said. "In some 
cases, I feel blind. to

PARKING 
ContInued from .,... 1 
ulty and administration. 

The use of alternative transportation is 
significant for more reasons than just the 
reduction of UCSD parking lot conges-
tion. 

For example. the San Diego APeD 
rnay choose to raise the requirement of the 
average numberof people percarcommut-
ing to UCSD. If UCSD commuters fail to 
meellhe e tandards,UCSDcouldbetaxed 
or fi ned tor every parking spot on campus. 

j\ <; representative to the task force 
Mar\... Rute nberg said that students on the 
task force lobbied to have the surtaxes paid 
by all parking permit holders and all fac-
ulty, staff and students, in addition to gift 
to UCSD of cash or equipment, fund the 
UCSD Alternative Transportation pro-
grams. The question will be decided over 
the course of this quaner. 

The recommendations also call for the 
construction nfl' <l r\"' illg ,t!'lIetllre oncarn-
pus, but not as many structures as the 
UCSD Master Plan recommends. 

"It would be simply too expensive to 
follow the Master Plan." said ROtenberg. 
11le cost of building a parking structure 
averages $14,000 per space. 

A report completed last Augu t by the 
consulting firm of Chance Management 
Associates (CMA), however. agrees with 
the C D MasterPlan's recommendation 
that UCSD should build underground park.-
ing lots that would not diminish the beauty 
of Central Campus. 

The task force opposes underground 
parking because the extremely high costs, 
approximately $2.5,000 per space. would 
force a harp rise in the price of a UCSD 

p~rkil1g pennit. 
Tile current UCSD parking facilities 

cost an average of $ 1.200 per space. 
Because state law mandates that cam-

pus parking and facilities must be finan-
cially self-supporting. it would be difficult 
for UCSD's parking and transportation 
sy tern to fulfill the Master Plan' propos-
als for expensive parking structures and 
underground lots without noticeable in-
creases in parking prices. 

"1lle Master Plan represents the worst 
case scenario [for parking policiesl." 
Rotenberg said. "The old policies are due 
for reconstruction." 

The task force also discussed a restruc-
turing of the "A." "B." and "S" pennit 
system. Currently. the "A" faculty spaces 
and the "S" taff and graduate student 
spaces are fairly centralized and conve-
nient, while the yellow student "S" spaces 
generally lie on the outsid~ periphery of 
Central Campus. 

Rotenberg said that some task force 
members suggested that pennits be priced 
according to their proximity to Central 
Campus. 1l1is would mean rdi ing the 
price of convenient "A" and "S" pennits 
while reducing the price of the "S" per-
mits. and making all pennits available to 
student, faculty and staff members. 

Others expressed concern about a park-
ing system that would benefit only those 
able to afford 'A' parking. pushing those 
who would not be able to afford conve-
nient parking to the exterior of campus. 

The task force report stressed the im-
portance of communication between the 
UCSD parking and transportation pro-
grams and students, staff and faculty. to 
avoid complaints. 1lle report stated that 
task force members feel that common com-
plaints against the UCSD parki ng and trans-
portation system could be avoided if the 
public understood the system's legal and 
financial limitations.

THE STATE OF THE DREAM 

VIolence Degrades King's Memory 
00 the day when the nation's anemion was focused on the 

accomplishments of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., procescors were 
throwing rocks in Denver. 

Those projectile weren't being thrown in Arizona, the stale that 
has been savagely attacked in recent years for its lack of a paid slate 
Ci vii Rights holiday. They were being thrown in Colorado by people 
who had taken the day off from work, supposedly to honor King. 

The greatest irony of all, though, i that the people throwing the 
stone were self-describedJollowtrs of King and hi teachings -
and their targets were members of the Ku KJux Klan. 

It 's sickening to think that on the binhday ofa man celebrated for 
hi philosophy of social progress through nonviolence, his "suppon-
ers" were violendy attacking others. It's an act roughly equivalent to 
denouncing democracy on the Fourth of July. 

But the incident in Denver wasn't the only instance of violence 
supposedly in King' name this year. The rap group Public Enemy's 
latest video, "Sy the Time I Get to Arizona." features a fictional 
Arizona politician who is attacked by both guns and explosives. 

Of course, Public Enemy' targets are those in Arizona and 
elsewhere who believe that there shouldn't be a holiday in King's 
name. And group members claim that thei r song and video are in the 
spirit of Dr. King. 

Violence in the name of Martin Luther King, Jr.? In the name of 
a Nobel Peace Prize winner? Nothing could be more disgusting. 

In his 1963 Iener from the Sinningham City Jail. King wrote 
about the "excellent way oflove and nonviolent protest," and warned 
orlhe horrors that racial violence would bring. But perbaps it was his 
peech in Washington, the "I have a dream" speech, that said it best: 

" In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty 
of wrongful deeds," King said. "Let us not seek to sari fy our thirst 
for freedom by drinking from the cup of binemess and hatred. We 
must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and 
discipline. We must not allow our creative protestto degenerate into 
physical violence." 

In its video, Public Enemy seems to have drunk deeply from that 
cup of hatred. Its advocacy of violence has nothing to do with what 
King stood for. and what his memory still stands for. 

But Public Enemy's video is just violent art. While it seems to 
condone violent acts, the video is not violence unto itself. What the 
marchers in Denver did was violence, pure and simple. 

If King had been in Denve~ on his 63rd birthday, he would have 
been filled with sadness. The racist rantings of the KKK members 
would be as horrible as al ways, of course - but the violent ways of 
the pro-Civil Rights protestors would have been just as distressing. 

King knew that the use of violence does nothing but reduce those 
struggling for ajust cause to a position as low as their unjust enemy. 
Perhaps it's even wprse than that - the KKK members did nothing 
but shout slogans and leave the area, while the Civil Rights activists 
auacked both KJansmen and pOlice. 

Violence, King warned. was against the ways of God and would 
do nothing but hun the struggle for civil rights. He knew that the path 
of violence leads only to racial separatism and growing hatred and 
fear between different people. 

"We cannot walk alone," King said. Peace between the different 
races of this country cannot be achieved by violence or separatism. 
People of all races must be involved if we are to achieve true racial 
equality and hannony. 

The actions last weekend in Denver and the images being spread 
throughout the nation by Public Enemy both fell under the shadow 
of Martin Luther King, Jr. But violence,like racism, was something 
that King despised. 

Perhaps this new wave of violence and violent imagery marks a 
changing in the way racism is addressed in America. Public Enemy's 
song "Fight the Power" appears in Spike Lee's Do Ihe Righi Thing 
along with a Malcolm X quotation. Lee's newest ftlm will be a 
biography of Malcolm X. 

Malcolm X's philosophy was that liberation for blacks must be 
achieved "by any means necessary" - including, of course. vio-
lence. If Public Enemy and the proteslors in Denver ope to use 
violence to fight racism, that's their choice. 

Sut if they do choose such a path, they shouldn't be allowed to 
hide behind Dr. ManinLutherKing,J~.-becauseKin& would have 
abhorra1 their actions. King was not hateful. Groups like Public 
Enemy and other advocates of racial violence are - and that hare 
degrades King's memory.

HowCcl1 Jim 
Carruthets 
Sleep at Night? 
Editor: 

I know this question mlBt gel asked 
quite oftat, but really, how does Jim 
Carruthers sleep at night? 

Over the past month, I have been 
following the whole co-op sIatuS di-
1emma and have watched the part thal 
die University Cederditectorhas played 
with great curiosity. 

I find it interesting that he: should 
recommend that Groundwork Books 
explore the possibilities of an indepen-
dent payroll. all the time knowing he 
would Ialer use the same action as am-
munition against the co-ops. 

I smeD a rat. It is hard to believe that 
the stench is not appalling to Canuthers' 
senses as well It seems obvious - and 
please correct me if I am wrong - that 
he does not have the sludents' best 
interest in mind. 

Instead, it appears he has hidden 
personal motives foracting out this ven-
detta.ls he trying to cuny favor with the 
administration. as he 100ks out and sees 
the Price Center in the red? The student-
run co-ops work. In fact, they wort. 
extremely well. 

Aren't universities set up for the 
students? And isn't Carruthers, as part 
of the administration of the university, 
supposed to facilitate our learning? 

Perhaps he thinks that he is _better 
preparing the youth of today by forcing 
us to deal with a corrupt bureaucracy, 
not unlike the one by which our present 
society is governed. 

Has he ever thought of running for 
president? He seems to have all the 
qualities that characterize our politi-
cians these days. 

Maybe he isthejealous typeormaybe 
his ego is too big to allow olher peoples , 
success on "his" campus. I do not un-
derstand his motives. 

How did heevercome to be a univer-
sity administtator when your actions 
seem to imply that you are waging war 
against the university students,the very 
ones who pay your salary. 

GnmtcdI might bebiased-mostof 
my information has come from the c~ 
opsandarticles written in the Guardian. 
Maybe there are some valid, ethical 
reasons for the mess that Carruthers has 
stirmJ up. 

He owes the student body Wl oppor-
tunity to hear a coherent explanation of 
his actions, and poSsibly decide that the 
whole situation smells so bad simply 
because we have not heard the enti~ 
story. 

All that I am asking is for some 
honesty. I do not propose to speak on 
behalf of the co-ops, nor the student 
body • Jarae, but maybe on behalf of 
some VCI)' basic: morals. 

I 1111 noI narve to the facllhat the 
university needs money and sees the

put through that kind of oppression. 

Now thal the FMLN and the Salva-
doran government have signed a peace 
accord to go into effect Feb. I, it is only 
natural to rerum to that night of the massa-
cre of Jesuits. Many believe it was the 

\11 LEFT FOOT ' ~ " , 

watershed event that marlccd the moment 
that the Salvadoran government realized 
its dirty ways with human life we~ begin-
ning to upset the American public and 
their ignorant monies. Remembering 
Ignacio EUacuria takes us on a journey 
that explains, if only partially, the horror 
of El Salvador's civil war, as well as the 
hard questions about the peace to corne. 

Inbis last publisbed anicle, the 59-year 
old EIlacuria wrote: "Liberation cannot 
consist of a progression from poverty to 
riches through the poverty of others, but 
with an overcoming of poverty through 
solidariry."ldeas such as these brought a 
man of peace into the gunsights of the 
Salvadoran far right. 

The rap on ElIacuria, as far as the 
vested interests were concerned, was that 
he was a front man for the FMLN. 
EIIacuria. however. was an advocate of 
diaIogueandpeace. He was willing to ta1k 
to both sides. II was not the fiction of him 
being an undercover " terrorist" that made 
him seem dangerous to many. but the fact 
that his was a critical stance - impatient 
with U.S. meddling in E1Sa1vador's inter-
nal problems. 

In 1988, while investigating a possible 
Salvadoran connection in the bombing of 
a Guatemalan university where Father 
Jon Sobrino was scheduled to speak on the 
"1beology of Liberation," Mexican re-
poner Enrique Onego met with Orlando 
de Sola, El Salvador's president of the 
Council of Free Trade, a wealthy land-

COMMENTARY 

owner and government official that had 
been educated in Guatemala's elite far 
rigbtFranciscoMarroquin University. De 
Sola laughed off Sobrino but turned seri-
ous when EUacuria was brought up. "'The 
dangerousoneisEllacuria,"hetoldOrtego, 
who quoted him in the Mexican newspa-
per EI Progress, "He is the one that sticks 
his face in the politics of my counll)'." 

Faced with a welklisciplinedand popu-
larly supponed insurgency, elements of 
the Salvadoran govemment and the mili-
tary become enthused with indiscriminate 
terror as a last-ditch weapon. Ellacuria 
was but one of the thousands of victims of 
this policy. 

Let us not forget the woman whose 
breasts were cut off in the name of 
"Counterterrorism," or the kidnappings 
and interrogation by torture carried out by 
the more fascistic elements of the estab-
lishment. Let us not forget the indiscrimi-
nate bombings (with U.S. bombs) of the 
provinces of Guazapo. Mornzan and 
OlaIatenangointhemid-eighties.Thebru-
tal massacre was in flagrant disregard to 
the stipulations of the Geneva Conven-
tion, and so noted by the United Nations. 

Let us not forget Archbishop Amulfo 
Romero, who also dared to speak out 
against injustice and was assassinated for 
it. We cannot forget the human rights 
activists who dared to protest the killing 
and torture, only to later fall in the hands of 
the murderers themselves. Heroes and mar-
tyrs. 

The challenge of reconstituting a soci-
ety as violated as El Salvador's darkens 
our relief regarding the peace accord. How 
will the wounds of prolonged terror begin 
to heal? Will the peace be sabotaged? Shall 
the tonurers be allowed to wander free in 
peace time, after the heinous crimes they 
have commined against humanity? 

Nonetheless, maybe Father Ellacuria 
would have been proud to know that his 
death had ultimately served peace: as I 
believe it did. 

Time Grows Short for the Last Bastion of the Left 
• The 'great Marxist experiment' in Cuba is on the brink of collapse - and it's about time 
By MatIhew RobInIon 
Associate Opinion Editor 

For many progressives Cuba and Castro 
have represented the future. He and his coun-
try, so they say, have stood as beacons to the 
West - shining example of COfllRIunism in 
action. Cuba has been seen as everything the 
United States and the West is not-compas-
sionate, egalitarian and progressive. 

Castro was a compassionate leader who in 
the face ofWestem imperialism led his coun-
try through a revolution and implemented the 
powers of the Stale to make people equal. 

Someone is now challenging this idea and 
it looks like the winds of freedom arcgoing to 
sweep over the island of Cuba. Curiously 
enough. this is not being done by an Ameri-
can or any Right-winger but by the Cuban 
peop1e prompted by Castro's failures. 

Writes one prominent dissident: "No. 
Sei'ior Fidel Castro, the Cuban opposition 
isn't from or in the United States. regardless 
oflhalCOUDtry's questionable positions. Your 
opposition is yourself and your own contra-
dictions . .. the economic, poIilical and social 
failure of the last 32 years. .. 

Castroinrecentmonthshasc:~down 
on many citizens with startIina ferocity for 
exprasing such sentiments. He is a man who 
has warched with hotror the death of his 

ideological big brother, :he mighty Soviet 
Union. And he knows he is next. 

The Cuba of the Leftist's imagination 
is very different from the Cuba of reality. 
Castro has jailed 24 democratic activists 
including Maria Elena Cruz Varela. a re-
nowned poeL He forced her to eat her 
political works in front of her daughter and 
a crowd that chanted and cursed at her. 

The man who was the hero of the 
American Left is now being revealed for 
what he is - a two-bit power-monger and 
tyrant. And his regime is finally receiving 
the criticism it so richly deserves. 

And with the spell of the Soviet Empire 
broken people are realizing the grim reali-
ties of communism. It took Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn. the Russian luminary, and 
his suffereings to alert the West to the true 
nature of the despotic regime that occu-
pied the Kremlin and operated the Gulag 
Archipelago. 

And it now looks as if Cuba and Castro 
are now facing the same truth. 

The bungling CIA tried 10 assassinate 
Castro by the use of poisonous wet-suits, 
exploding sea-shells, toxic cigars (that 
were supposed to make his beard fallout) 
and Cuban gangsters. 

Now the simple desi~ for freedom by 

his people may be his undoing. He has been 
taken off the $13 billion free ride given to him 
by the Soviet government and is now facing 
the consequences. 

1be Left's economic oasis was merely a 
mir.lge buoyed by the white haired old men of 
Moscow. In truth, he has done what every 
communistutopiahasdonesosucce sfully-
he has delivered total equality in poverty and 
servitude to the state. 

Since Castro' s ascent into power 32 years 
ago the annual growth-rate per capi/a has 
been minus 1.2 percent. The Cuban commu-
nist ideal. like many Leftist ideas, is that the 
state can be used to create equality and pros-
perity for all by directing everyone to do their 
part. Manage and redistribute was the idea-
and the consequences have been seen before 
in the Soviet Union and Central Europe. Equal-
ity of circumstance, like in other totalitarian 
regimes, has meant for Cuba the destruction 
of freedom. 

Three months ago I interviewed a woman 
who was selling books about communism. I 
asked her about the Soviet Union and she 
dido 't seem to think it fulfilled Marx's ideals. 
Then I asked her about Cuba. She said that it 
was Castro who was successfully enacting 
what Marx intended.

Leon Trotsky once said that if

that UCSD seniors will contribute 
the bulk of fundina in the form of

will also be requesting funds from

In future years, graduaIes return-

"Everybody knows he is a man 
of power, not ideas," he said, adding 
that Yeltsin has no solutions to the 
probl~ that plague his country. 
Kozlov said Yeltsin lost his largest 
group of supporters, elderly women, 
when he implemented price in-
creases on Jan. 2, something he had 
earlier promised would not happen. 

Kozlov has worked at the Insti-
tute of Marxism and Leninism for 
theCenttal Commineeofthe Com-
munist Party.1llere he had access to 
the newly released secret party ar-
chives while working on a rehabili-
tation of N.I. Bucharin, an early 
Bolshevik who was convicted in the 
Soviet show trials of 1936. 

Kozlov said his first priority in 
the United States is to understand 
the people and the country . His other 
main objectives are to work in 
American libraries, gaining access 
to rnalerials unavailable to him in 
Moscow, and to gain a bener future. 

"Russians prefer not to speak 
about it. but it is imponant," Kozlov 
said. "Here I will receive a lot of 
money by Russian standards. It will 
be a good support for me and my 
family when [return to Russia." 

Previously, Kozlov worked for 
15 years in the Academy of Science 
in the Institute of History of the 
USSR.

Men's Basketball Looks for Ninth Win in a Row 

UCSO will rely on Chris Moore to shut down Menlo's men in the middle. 

• UCSD looks for a 
crucial Division ill win 
tomorrow night against 
Menlo; the Oaks will be 
tougher than they look 
By Ken Perlman 
Sports Editor 

To look ahead at the UCSD men's 
basketball game against Menlo Col-
lege Friday night, you might think 
that predicting an outcome would 
be easy. 

On the one hand. there's UCSD 

The Oaks are one of UCSD's 
biggest Division ill rival . 

Despite its less than menacing 
overall record, UCSD Head Coach 
Tom Marshall asserts that Menlo is 
a definite threat. 

"They're now in the role of the 
spoiler," said Marshall. "[Menlo] 
always provides problems for us." 

The Oaks are one of the few 
tewns the Tritons have faced this 
season that can match up with them 
physically . 

Led by 6-6 Randy Newnan, 
Menlo is a definite threat in ide.

Lack of Size Proves to be Volleyball's DOWllfal1 
.1be Tritons drop to 
0-4 on the season after 
losing to USC in Los 
Angeles on Tuesday 
15-5, 15-6, 15-9 
ByKlrat.n ........ 
Guardian Reporter 

Size seems to be the only thing 
standing between the men's volley-
ball team and a win. 

"We're smaller than everyone 
else and you have to be twice as 
good to be smaller," said UCSD 
Head Coach Rod Wilde. 

Size was a big factor Tuesday as 
the Tritons fell to USC 15-5, 15-6, 

15-9. 
TIle loss dropped the Tritons to 

0-4 on the season. 
Despite the loss, Wilde was im-

pressed with the Tritons' perfor-
mance. 

"'The scores didn't indicate it 
but they didn't blow us out of the 
gym," he said. 

TIle entire three-game match 
lasted almost two hours. 

Both sides battled hard for each 
point. 

Lamson Lam hit quite well for 
the evening with only a few errors. 
Overall he had 18 kills in 38 at-
tempts. 

Lam also contributed three ser-

vice aces. 
Brent Couture had 21 attempts 

with \0 kills and four errors while 
Mati Brigham had four kills in nine 
attempts. Brighwn had only two 
errors on the evening. 

Bruce Williams and Gerry 
Goldstein came off the bench to 
make significant contributions. 

Overall, the Tritons played bet-
ter defense than in their previous 
games, scrambling forballsanddigs. 

UCSD limited the Trojans to a 
43.9 hitting percentage. 

TIle Tritons, however, couldn't 
fare any better as they managed a 
meager 11 .5 percent. 

For USC, John Mulholland had 

20 kills in 34 attempts. Mulholland 
committed six errors. 

The coaches feel the team needs 
to work on its consistency factor. 
Errors in hilling will be eliminated 
as the teams consistency improves. 

In the second game UCSD was 
down 14-2 but managed toside-out 
nine times before allowing USC 10 
take the game 15-6. 

"We won a lot of long rallies 
which are usually won by the bener 
team," said Wilde. " 

The team is looking forward to 
the Santa Barbara Invitational where 
they will play some lower ranked 
tewns and hopefully get some wins 
on the board. 

Men's Volleyball Looks Ahead to UCSB Invitational 
• Tritons continue 
playing on the road as 
they head north to 
compete in two-day 
tournament 
ByClNtlR ....... 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team has had some stiff competition 
in its young season. So far, it has 
played four teams in the top ten -
PeppmIine(4th), UCLA (2nd), ucr 
(8th), and USC (5th). And they've 
yet to play a game at horne. This 
weekend the Tritons will again hit 
the road 10 play more tough teams in 
the UC Santa Barbara Invitational 
toumamenL 

1be tournament is a two-day af-
fair on Friday and Saturday. 

UCSD's rlrst three matches are 
set, and they are all on Friday. The 
Tritons could pcxentialIy play five 
marches on that one day. 

Because of the numerous games 
that UCSD and all the teans in the 
tournamCIlt will play, the mau:bes 
are only the best two out of three 
gamca imIead of three our of five. 

In its tina mIlCh. UCSD will 
take 011 Cal Slate Lona Beach. The 
49as 8fti the top I'II1ked te8m in the 
JIllion Iftd 8fti just comina off a big 

win against UCLA. 
Next, the Tritons will clash with 

aclub team from Buffalo, New York. 
Although the squad from Buf-

falo is not NCAA-sanctiOned, the 
cOaching staff of the Tritons sti II 
expect a tough match. 

This is the first year the team 
from Buffalo has competed in the 
tournament 

TIle Tritons will then take on 
another club tewn, this one from 
Olico State. As with Buffalo, Head 
Coach Rod WildeexpeclS the squad 
from Olico 10 be competitive. 

''1l1ey've been one of the top 
club teams," Wilde said. 

Wilde explained that the Tritons 
major goal for the tournament will 
be-to qualify for the "Power Pool." 
The pool will be composed after the 
Tritons and the other teams com-
plete their firsl round of competi-
tion. 

Wilde believes thatifUCSD wins 
two of its three matches against 
Long Beach, Buffalo, and Olico, 
the Tritons will be placed in the 
"Power Pool." 

Qualifying forthe "Power Pool" 
will enable the Tritons to play 
tougher teams for the remainder of 
the tournament, and hopefully raise 
the collective level of their game. 

Because of the inIense playing

The Tritons will look to Lamson Lam to lead the team's offensive attack. 
schedule in the competition, Wilde 
sees the depth of a team as one of the 
keys for success. 

''The teams that traditionally win 
these tournaments are the ones that 
have the most depth," Wilde said. 

In the past, UCSD teams have 
had trouble in this type of competi-

tion because of the fatigue factor. 
"We try to field really strong 

teams to get into the Power Pool. 
Our starters get tired andexhausted," 
Assistant Coach Scott Criswell said. 

Other teams compeling in the 
tournamenl include UCLA, 
Pepperdine, Hawaii and BYU.

14 The UCSD Guardian Tbunday, January 13,1991 

An Open Letter to the Students of the University of California 

[ hope you ~1I take a few minutes to r ad this letter, which seeks to explain the basis 
for the 1992-93 student fee increase approved by The Regents last week. 

As you know, California is experiencing an economic and fiscal crisis. This carries 
special significance for the University of California and the California State University 
becau e these institutions are in the 15 percent of State-funded programs and services 
subject to budget reductions, the remaining 85 percent being mostly protected by law 
against budget reductions. 

The Governor, therefore, has proposed a budget increase of 1.5 percent in State 
General Funds for UCs nine campuses in 1992-93. While this falls well short of the 10 
percent needed to cover such things as increased costs resulting from inflation and 
enrollment growth, I believe the Governors budget proposal is the best we can hope for 
given the tates fiscal problems. 

This incr as in tat funds, however, annot sustain both the quality of your 
education and a cess to the University for all eligible undergraduate students. Accord-
ingly, The Regents acted last week to ensure student access and maintain the University's 
capability, and to do so in ways whi h distribute the burden as equitably as possible across 
th UC community. For example: 1) UC faculty and staff will receive no cost-of-living 
in rease for th second year in a row; 2) salaries will be frozen for the University's most 
senior executives for the second consecutive year; 3) State General Fund support for the 
ornc of the President's adminislrativ budget will be reduced by 25 percent through a 

mbination f harge t non-Stat funded activities and reductions in operations, and 
4) student fees will b incr ased by $183 per quarter ($275 per semester), or $550 a year, 
an in rease of 22 p rcent over th current year. 

L r alize that thi in reas r pres nts a Significant additional burden for large 
numb rs of students. Thus, financial aid-in the form of grant and/or loan assistance-
will b provided to ov r the fee increase for all needy students, including middle-income . 
students. For students who are not eligible for need-based financial aid but nonetheless 
have difficulty finan ing th ir education, v ry effort will be mad to info~m them about 
other financin option , p ially about underutilized loan programs. And finally, the fee 
in rae will b fully ov r d for t a hing and r search assistants. 

Even with this in reas in fees, UC students ne t year will be paying fees comparable 
l th at th 23 publi institutions UC uses for fee comparison purposes. And 
comparing fee lev Is adjusted for California per capita personal income, you will be paying 
about the same as UC students paid in 1971-72. 

I am keenly aware that the cost of attending UC has gone up dramatically, but as fe~s 
increase next year so too will the number of courses and sections offered so that you will 
be able to enroll in the cIas e you need to make timely progress toward your degree. 

As the budget is r vi wed by the Legislature in the coming months, we will be 
working with student leaders in what I hop will be a common commitment to prevent 
any further cuts in our budget, any further increases in student fees, and to preserve the 
quality of our UniverSity. J

Hockey Goes 1-0-3 in Toumament 
• Tritons beat up on host 
Fresno State 6-2 in final 
game on Monday 
.,..,.w.-
Assoc.e Spotts Editor 

TheUCSD ice hockey tcamtrav-
eled all the way to the Central Val-
ley for. few wins Ibis weekend, but 
ended up tying three games out of 
four. ~ 

The Tritons started out on Satur-
day morning in a game against Cal 
Stale Northridge. After three peri-
ods, the game ended in a deadlock at 
three apiece. 

Standouts for UCSO were Jim 
McLeod with a goal and an assist; 
OlrisJoMson also had a goal and an 
assist and John Stein slapped one 
into the net to finish out the team's 
scoring. 

Saturday night, the team took on 
St Mary's and again the gameended 
in a draw, this time 44. 

Tom Gould contributed a goal 
and two assists while Josh Parker 
also chipped in a score. 

Dan Meade led the team, push-
ing two shots past the befuddled 
Gael goalie.

Having snuggled throughout the 
game, the Tritons pulled their goalie 
in the closing moments. 

Down by one with only eleven 
seconds left, UCSD's Leigh Hsu 
was able to sink the tying shot. 

The Tritons finished out thetour-
nament strongly, bulldogging host 
Fresno State, 6-2 in the fmal. 

TIm Kranz led UCSD with two 
goals, while Josh Parlter, Chad 
Hinkle and Jim Mcleod each man-
aged a score.

The Asian-American theater troupe Here and Now is pictured here with eight of its members. 

DIe Wave of tile 
Future is Ilere and Now 
By Jenny GaIanC 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Performing thi Friday in cel-
ebrationof Asian Awareness Week, 
the theater troupe Here and Now 
breaks through cultural baniers to 
bring real-life experiences to multi-
cultural audjence . Striving to edu-
cate and entertain, the members of 
Here and Now bring their personal 
experience to lifeon the tage. The 
ll -membercastiscomprisedofboth 
tudents and professional actors, all 

of whom contribute to a how that 
combines poetry, drama and dance. 

According to Artistic Director 
John Miyasaki, the troupe was con-
ceived three years ago with the vi-
ion to entertajn and al 0 tell the 
tory of Asian-American life by 

Asian-American people. Their ma-
terial deals with social and political 
is ues, delving into understanding 
uffering, celebration and the true 

meaning of pride. 
This year' how i called "Pride 

of the People," and j comprised of 
a serie of vignette and scenes. 
Here and Now i proud of both the 
diversity in the strength of its mem-
bers, and al 0 in its material and

approach. 
The cast finds thatthi diversity 

pleases a wider audience. Addres -
ing self-discovery as well as the 
pain and joy of growing up as an 
A ian-American, the troupe trives 
to build an understanding between 
people as well as to entertain its 
audience. After every show, the cast 
holds a group discu sion, an open 
que tion-and-an wer period. The 
audience can learn about how the 
actors feel as well as investigate 
their own personal emotion . 

Although the cast i primarily 
Asian, Miyasakj stressed that the 
how is about awareness and further 

understanding for everyone. Here 
and Now has performed at the last 

two UC Student of Color Confer-
ence , and it was there that it real-
ized that its how could cros the 
cultural barriers to bring its message 
to people from all different back-
grounds. 

Miyasaki explained that before 
the first conference, the troupe was 
used to performing primarily for 
Asian groups and that it was wor-
ried about the audjence reaction 
since so many of the student were 
African-American and Latino. "We 
were scared and intimidated, but 
this show was the first time that we 
got a real, genuine standing ovation. 
It just hows that it doesn't mailer 
who you play [the tories] for, be-
cause the message is universal." 

Miyasaki explained that during 
the troupe's early days, it had a hard 
time drawing audiences. He said 
people weren't used to the idea of 
Asian-Americans in theater because 
there are so few in prominent roles 
in today's society. 

Neverthele s, Here and Now has 
become more popular and it audi-
ence has grown, not just in numbers, 
but also in it understanding of each 
other.
