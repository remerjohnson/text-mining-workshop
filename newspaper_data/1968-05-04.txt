.4 May 1968 

Undergrads Elect 
Shepard President 

Tom Shepard and Trish Cun-
ningham received more than two-
thirds of the votes in last week's 
run-off election to become the 
new officers of the Associated 
students for the year 1968-1969. 

In lighter turn-outs than in the 
previous Wednesday's General 
Election, Revelle students also 
elected Jeff Benjamin, William 
Eastman, and Paul Ricks as their 
representatives to the AS Senate. 

The election culminated two 
and a half weeks of intensive 
campaigning by 21 candidates for 
ten AS oCfices. The new AS gov-
ernment will take oCfice at the 
second annual Installation of New 
Officers banquet Monday. Chan-
cellor Galbraith, Dean Murphy 
and the College Provosts, among 
others will attend. 

A significant feature of the 
outcome of the two elections is 
the proportion of power that each 
college will now control in AS 
government. When President 
Shepard transfers to Muir Col-
lege, five senators will be at 
Revelle, 3 at Muir, and both 
officers at the Second College. 

A breakdown of class repr e-
sentation also s ignals the con-
tinuance of sophomore control 
in the Senate next year. Half 
the Senate will be sophomores 
next year, three will be junior s 
and one will be a senior. This 
year the Senate consisted of 4 
sophomores and 4 juniors. 

The election of Trish Cunning-
ham marks the second time a girl 
has been elected Vice-President. 
Senior Janet Albin served in the 
same capacity four years ago. 

UCSD has never had a junior 
as President. The first two years, 
senior Larry Baker was presi-
dent (Albin served to as well) and 
the last two years the PreSidents, 
Rick Moncreiff and Rich Alten-
hoff, were seniors,

President Dennis Michaud said 
he contacted Bennett about the 
matter four months ago. 

"Bennett will take it all the 
way to the state supreme court 
if he has to,· he said. Michaud 
is spokesman for the UC stu-
dent Body Presidents Council. 

According to Michaud, only $3 
million of the increased fees will 
be going towards scholarshIps. 

Governor Reagan has indicated 
that the fee increase is only 
-the first step in the Univer-
sity's acceptance of theIr own 
fiscal responsibility,· Michaud 
continued.

Revelle 

Announe 
Gov~t Plan 

Provost Saltman admitted that 
UCSD has not yet reached the 
goals set for it by those who 
first thought of creating a new 
university based on entirely new 
concepts. The Clrcle K sponsored 
the question and answer perirvi 
Monday night at 8 p.m. in USB 
2722. One of these goals is the 
creation of a true collegium 
where the unive rsityadministra-
tion, faculty and students would 
settle common difficulties in an 
atmosphere ot mutual trust and 
respect. However, it seems to 
Dr. Salt man that the student body 
accepts confrontation as the only 
way to solve problems. He would 
like to see the creation of a 
government which would unite 
the administration, faculty , and 
student body into one unit. 

Michaud said the constitution-
ality of the fee inc'rease was 
being questioned on the grounds 
of "taxation without representa-
tion, since the Regents are in-
sisting on using student fees for 
administrative expenses." He 

The constitutionality of the fee 
increase w!ll also be challenged 
by the fact that at present a

Two Faculty Members 
Receive Top Honors 

Two members olthe Univ~rs1ty 
of California, San Diego faculty 
have been elected to membership 
in the National Academy of Sci-
ences, one of the highest honors 
which can be accorded to an 
American scientist or engineer. 

They are Dr. Henry W. Menrad, 
Professor of Geology at UCSD's 
Scripps Institution of Oceano-
graphy, and Dr. William Prager, 
Professor of Applied Mechanics 
In the Department of Aerospace 
and Mechanical Engineering Sci-
ences. The annolJncement of their 
election was made Tuesday, AprU 
23, by the Academy at its 105th 
annual meeting in Washington, 
D.C. 

Drs. Menrad and Prager were 
elected for their "distinguished 

and continuous achievements in 
original research." Their elec-
tion brIngs to 21 the number of 
National Academy of Sciences 
members now on the UCSD cam-
pus. 

Dr. Menrad's chief field of 
study is the no or of the sea, 
particularly that of the Pacific 
Ocean and he has contributed 
greatly to the understanding of 
the ocean bottom. His reasearch 
findings have been the topic of 
numerous scientific papers. In 
June 1964, Dr. Menr d was in-
strumental in discovering where 
an ocean rise had existed in the 
mid-Pacific, 100 million years 
before. 

Continued on page 4 

Provost Salt man has announced 
that Revelle College will hold its 
first open meeting next Tuesday 
at noon. Classes will be cancelled 
for the duration of the meeting 
which undergraduates, gradu-
ates, faculty, and administration 
will partiCipate in. 

The topic will be he future 
government of Revelle College. 
After two quarters' work CGSA 
(Committee on Student Affairs) 
has come up with a proposal, 
which will be presented. In antici-
pation of a luge turnout Saltman 
said that USB 2622, USB 2722, 
and HL Aud will be used, with a 
closed-circuit TV linkup between 
the three rooms. 

The establishment of a Revelle 
College government has become 
crucial this year since UCSD's 
multi-college system has become 
a reality. Muir College already 
has set up a provisional govern-
ment, while Revelle, in operation 
since 1965 (for undergrads) as yet 
has d Oli!! II I) : illng. 

Ttl COSA plan will be distri-
buted to the Univer ltycommuni-
ty and the following w ek - May 
13, 14, and 15 - th re will be 
qu s tion and answer discussion 
sessions held. 

Repres ntatives will be elected 
to partiCipate in th R velIe gov-

ernment before the year is 
through. However, it was stress-
ed by the Provost that they will 
be the ones to actually wr ite 
the constitution; COSA's plan is 
only a suggestion. 

Petitions will be a vanable for 
students who are interested in 
running for th Revelle offic s. 
Saltman said that the governm nt 
would have repr s ntatives from 
all the grou~ s that compri the 
university commnnity. It would 
be an advisory body to th Prov0st 
and would 0 fully hav con-
structive id to off r him. 

To a question concerning the 
proposed seminar on the draft, 
Provost SaUman replied that the 
administ ration and faculty are 
very interested in the Selective 
Service problem. He said that the 
univer ity ha invited important 
national flgures to come to UCSD 
late in May for a ser ies of sym-
posiums and seminar , which 
would last for a week or so. The 
names were not revealed because 
they have not as yet given any 
reply to their invitations. 

Further dIscussion on draft

sity revealed that anywhere from

Hstor ically 
Enthusiasm Fails 
Now that Tom Shepard and his new Senate have taken over the AS, 

it is time to look to the future and the signUicance of a new government. 
For three weeks, AS affairs have been on the minds or students more 
than at any other time of the year. Historically the new officers 
enter office with great enthusiasm and determination to get things 
done. As months pass by, however, we hear less and less from our 
elected representatives. 

Next year, with almost 3700 students at UCSD (including about 
2800 undergrads) the Senate will have a greater responsibility to 
reflect student opinion. They must not faU back Into the traditional 
habit of forgetting the students. Next year, hopefully, more than just a 
handful of students will know their Senators. 

With representation by colleges now in effect, the Senators should 
be able to meet more often with their dIstricts . The College Senators-
at- Large should make It a point of visiting all the dorm suites at least 
once a month. These six Senators have the duty to be informed of the 
status of their college governments at all times so that close coopera-
tion with the AS is mal.ntalned. 

As for the president and vice-president, we feel that they should 
utilize the resources of student organizations to carry out Senate 
programs. They should create an effective network of communications 
between the colleges and the AS Office and a monthly newsletter to all 
the students should be instituted to keep all undergrads informed of 
the Senate's latest actions. 

Finally Senate meetings must be publicized to attract student 
participation and interest. Minutes should be circulated and Senatorial 
articles for the Triton Times should be encouraged. Only with such 
wide-ranging efforts can the ten AS officers be truly responsiVE 
and representative of the students. 

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE 

Ca n You Accept 
The Challenge ? 
I do not wish to thank you for electing me. I wish only to tell you 

what I expect from you in the coming year. Any student who wishes to 
ignor e his r esponsibilities as a member of the University community, 
any student who believes that his education Ues only in the class room, 
any student who is satisfied with his present role in the Associated 
Students, will find the next year a very uncomfortable one. 

We live in a world In which no thinking individual can isolate himself 
fr om the realities of his environment. U we are to assume our roles as 
responsible citizens when we leave the Uiliversity, we must begin 
by involving ourselves in the affairs or the society of which we must soon 
become the leaders. 

U we do not accept this responsibility, there may not be any society 
to become a part of. 

The A.S. must and will be an organizer, a director, and an inspirer. 
The A.S. can no longer wait for the students to come to it; the A.S. 
must go to the students. 

There will be a reason for participating in the A.S. because as a 
collective force it can wield the power and direct the enthusiasm of 
its members into channels which constructively affect the University 
and the San Diego communities. 

The A.S. must and will be the agentfor student action and express ion. 
It will be not only the catalyst but also the executor of new ideas, ideas 
which may startle even the most progressive. And still, the A.S. wi1l 
re main a responsible body which cultivates student opinion. 

Whether you like it or not you will be hearing from the A.S. In the 
coming year.

Letters to the Editor 
Editor, The Triton Times, 

student organizations should 
refuse to pay the "Profit" Com-
pany fee for use of Revelle Cafe-
teria until the use of this fee can 
be ascertained. 

When I signed for Revelle 
cafeteria for the S. F. Mime 
Troupe, I was told of the ladder 
of fees charged, ranging from 
$12 to $47. For $47, the Profit 
Company would remove all furni-
ture and then repiace it and mop 
up. They wouldn't set up the 
chairs. So I "chose" the $35 fee 
which meant we would remove 
all furniture and set it up and 
Prom would put it back and clean 
up. 

The justification for this fee 
is that it covers the costs of the 
janitor and any extra work he 
must do. 

This seems logical. But when 
one discovers that none of this 
fee ever reaches the pockets of 
said janitor, that he rece ives a 
fixed daily wage which doesn't 
alter even if extra work or hours 
are Involved, then one mu st re-
fuse to pay this fee. 

The Grad. Lit. Assoc. was as-
tounded to discover this gross 
deception practiced on us and all 
student groups by Profit. We hope 
that an investigation will take 
place and that no one will pay 
the fee until the matter is cleared 
up. 

Sincerely, 
Sandra Dijkstra 
Chairman Grad Lit Assoc 

Editor, the Triton Times, 
As you are aware, the UCSD 

undergraduate resident students 
have recently voted for a new 
type of cafeteria arrangement 
for next year. Although a signifi-
cant number of students were in-
volved in this action, there seems 
to be no student representation 
following up the vote. Aside from 
allY economic or other benefits 
that may result from the newap-
proach, one of the major advan-
tages (and responsibility) is that 
there is now something to nego-
tiate when the contracts are out 
for bid, That is, there is a great 
degree of fiexiblllty and control 
that can be built into the opera-
tion of the food service . U the 
operatlon is to be optimally run 
for the students, it will require 
their representatives to get this 
information to the buslness of-
fice. The exact group may not be 
crucial, but the timing is. It 
mu st be organized FAST. The 
preliminary screening bids have 
been received and in the next 
three weeks the final details and 
selection of the contractor will 
be essentially completed. As far 
as I know, there has been no ef-
fort on the part of the s tudents to 
supply any help In working out 
the contracts . (U the administra-
tion pushes for such help too 
hard, are they then "dominating" 
the students ?) 

One hears a lot about " student 
power," students should be run-
ning things, etc. Here is a very 
concrete case In point. How much 
power can the students exercise

over their food system? The Bus-
iness OUice has suggested and 
supports a procedure that I think 
puts the challenge directly to the 
students. It is that student repre-
sentatives meet with representa-
tives of the various food compan-
Ies who are bidding for the con-
tract and question them about 
the operation of the tood ser-
vices. Then the answers or final 
concensus are noted and appended 
to the actual final contract. (In-
cidentally, there is a misunder-
standing among most students I 
have talked to that the "low bid" 
automatically wins. This is not 
that type of contract, and other 
factors may be taken into ac-
count to determlne the best aid .) 

Let me make it clear that the 
job is not a trivial one, either in 
concept or In time. The cafeteria 
business is much bigger than 
most students realize and it will 
require getting into all the hard 
facts to make an intelligent in-
quiry. Representatives should be 
prepared to meet for 4-7 hours 
preparing their analysis and then 
allow approximately 3-4 hours/ 
company, with perhaps four com-
panies, say around a 20-hour 
minim un. This group should then 
continue as a followup group to 
see that the contract Is imple-
mented properly and to serve as 
a representative body to approve 
those changes which may be de-
Sirable, as experience dictates. 
Inasmuch as the cafeteria will 
also be open, a reasonable group 
might be: one student as a com-
muter, one graduate student, two 
Muir dorm representatives, two 
Revelle dorm representatives , 
one member Revelle Food Com-
mittee, and perhaps, an AS dele-
gate as well. 

At the moment, the question is 
not "how much power" the stu-
dents can have with respect to 
the food services, it's how much 
work and responsibility are they 
wllling to assume. I am aware 
that compared to the bIg prob-
lems In our society to which stu-
dents are rightfully devoting so 
much time, his problem is a 
trivial one; nonetheless, the job 
must be done. U there is no 
student repre sentation to ftll this 
need, the adminIstration will fill 
it by default. Are the students 
really up to It? I am writing this 
letter in the hope that it wlll 
stlmuiate a positive answer and 
a real response, LIKE NOWI

New Marijuana Laws 
Forseen In California 

UCSD freshmen 
Tops In Nation 

The Assembly voted yesterday 
to ease the penalty for marijuana 
possession, afte r hearing that 
judges and prosecutor s evade the 
cu rrent law because it is too 
harsh on young people. 

At the same time, the lower 
house approved a toughening of 
penalties for possession of dan-
gerous drugs such as LSD. 

Both provisions were in the 
same bill, sent to the Senate on 
a 50-25 vote. 

"It's just like picking up a per -
son for one offense and letting 
him plead guilty to spitting on 
the sidewalk, " he declared. 

Curr ent law. adopted in 1961, 
requires that the first conviction 
for possession of marijuana must 
carry a felony penalty--that is, a 
term in state prison ot from one 
to 10 years. The judge may sus-
pend actual imprisonment. 

Biddle's bill gives the judge a 
choice of imposing ~tough 

penalty, or handing down a mis-
demeanor sentence. This bas a 
maximum ot one year in the 
county jail. 

The current misdemeanor only 
penalty for first offense convic-
tion on possessing a dangerous 
drug would be altered to give 
the court the same choice as It 
would have on marlj).lana -- im-
posing the tougher felony sen-
tence, or the milder mlsde-' 
meanor one. 

According to a recent San Diego 
Union feature article about the 
calibre of entering UCSD stu-
dents , our student body repre-
sents a distinct departure from 
national norms as we 11 as the 
standards set for all of the UC 
campuses. 

One example sighted by Judith 
Morgan in her article entitled 
"UCSD Frosh Top National 
Norms" was that four out ot ten 
UCSD freshman plan to earn the 

-------

The bill's author, Republican 
Assemblyman W. Craig Biddle 
or Riverside, said he is uncer-
tain whether the measure can 
pass the Senate. Gov. Reagan was 
asked about the bill Tuesday 
and said: 

Hershey Has Last Say in Graduate Draft 
"It is true that there is an 

inelasticity in the penalty that 
has now a tendency to let some 
violators oU because the penalty 
is so severe. That's what it is 
seeking to correct. I'm sym-
pathetic to that approach • • • " 

Assemblyman John T. Knok 
(D-Richmond), said easing the 
law may result in more offenders 
being sent to jail for the milder 
misdemeanor term. 

Biddle. a Cormer public de-
fender and deputy district at-
torney. noted that many lawauth-
orities evade the current tough 
law by agreeing with the de-
fendant to drop the marijuana 
charge if a guilty plea is ente red 
to anoth<ar, less sprious offeni;e. 

Despite mounting pressures, 
there is little evidence so far 
that there will be any changes in 
Selective Service regulations that 
threaten to depopulate graduate 
schools o!their first-and second-
year male students next faU. 

Appearing before the House 
Special Education Subcommittee, 
Selective Service Director lewis 
B. Hershey said the draft pol1cy 
is under continuing review. Unde r 
questioning, however, he said it 
is unlikely that the policy wlll be 
changed soon. 

The subcommittee called Gen-
era l Hershey to help clarify the 
impact of the draft on graduate 
schools so that the committee 
could make a better judgment on 
Administration- proposed legis-
lation to strengthen graduate edu-

Renaissance Coming 
To UCSD 

The emergence oC the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego as a 
major American center for Ren-
aissance studies will take a giant 
step forward early next month, 
when the school includes the com-
munity in its first symposium on 
the Renaissance. 

The program, titled "Man and 
Nature in the Renaissance" , will 
be held at 7:30 p.m., Sunday, May 
lZ in Sherwood Hall, La Jolla. 
It will be sponosored jointly by 
UCSD and the Salk Institute of 
Biological studies and will fea-
ture two of the nation's foremost 
scholars in Renaissance s tudies: 
Dr. Jacob Bronowski, Senior Fel-
low at Salk, and Dr. Charles S. 
Singleton, Profe ssor Humanistic 
Studies and Director of the Hu-
manities Center at the Johns Hop-

kins University. 
Dr. BrODowski will speak on 

"Magic and SCience in Renais-
sance Humanism." Dr. Single-
ton's topic is "Natura sibi 
relicta: ANewHumanandNatural 
Order in the Renaissance." The 
USCD Madrigal Singers willper-
form during the s ymposium in-
termission in the Sculpture 
Courtyard at Sherwood Hall. 

According to Gian Roberto 
Sarolli, Professor of Romance 
Philology and Italian Literature 
at UCSD and cochairman with 
Dr. Jason L. Saunders , Profes-
sor of Philosophy. of the com-
mittee planning the symposium, 
this is the first of many ventures 
into the Renaissance with the 
community.

cation. 
The general provided little 

clarification. Most people in the 
committee room felt the same 
frustration as that of Rep. James 
A. Scheuer (D-N.Y.), who said 
that while he listened to General 
Hershey he went from "con-
fusion, to beWilderment, to per-
plexity." 

After trying unsuccessfully for 
five minutes to clarify Selective 
Service appeal procedures, Rep. 
Frank Thompson, Jr. (D-N .J.) 
sarcastically thanked General 
Hershey for his "enlightening 
testimony" and left the room. 

The general bathed questioners 
in a flow of words spiced with 
evasion, humility, and aphor-
isms. Mr. Scheue r said he had 
justly earned the title as "the 
Casey Stengel of the Administra-
tion. 

Last month, General Hershey 
informed local boards that there 
would be no more graduate defer-
ments (except for people well 

and , that the policy of calling the 
oldest draft- ellgible men first 
would continue. 

Since graduate students are 
the oldest draft eligible, it is 
expected that almost all such men 
will be inducted into the armed 
forces. The impact falls on next 
year's Cirst- and second-year 
graduate students, who automati-
cally lose their student deter-

than one out of ten plan to achieve 
this academic plateau. 

Turning to past expe r ience as 
a measure of ability, the sur vey, 
conducted by a University of 
Michigan psychology pr ofessor 
during the past fall and winter 
quarters , reports that 75% of the 
imcomIng freshman have high 
school grade point averages of 
B plus or higher. The national 
figure quotes a figure approxi-
mating 45%. 

Similar ly, UCSD freshman lead 
entering classes all over the 
ution in their interest in the 
sciences showing three times the 
national Interest in mathematics 
and four times that in the physi-
cal sciences. 

In other areas, the new UCSD 
college set shows less interest 
and ability in sports and a greater 
level of independence than their 
counterparts across the nation. 
As might be expected a similar 
lag exists In seeking business 
careers or the performing arts 
while if teaching is their chosen 
profession it will most definitely 
be in the college lecture hall.

The "Frank McGee R eport", BC News, January 7, 1968, featured a spe-
cial story on the extent of Soviet educa tional and scientific achievements since 
October 1957, when the firs t Sputnik was launched . During this new fea-
ture, Mr. McGee commented : "The hea rt of research ... is the computer. 
Here the Russians frankly admit thcy're behind the United States by 5, even 
10 years . But the Soviet seien tists have comc a long way from the days when 
Stalin dccreed that computers were a wicked capitalist invention. Without 
the computer there would be no Soviet space program." ugene Lyon , 
senior editor of the Reader's Digest, reports in his recent book " Workers' 
Paradise Lost": "It is easy to understand why thc Kremlin is so eager to im-

the Soviet Union has not yet learned to make dependablc electronic devices."

UCS. Hosts PCIYRA Soccer Has Arrived 
Soccer has finally come to 

UCSD on the undergraduate level. 
Through the efforts of Randy 
Kanl and Bill SarteUs, and the 
assistance of athletic director, 
Howard Hunt, UCSD will field an 
intercollegiate soccer team, un-
der the coaching of Dr. Gian 
Sarolli. The team presently has 
a roster of 18 players, tour of 
whom have has previous playing 
experience. Randy Kaul, Bm 
Bartells, and Fred Grunewa11 
hRVIl played together last year 
for the HUltoppers in the San 
Diego County Junior SoccE'r 

~ague. The other veteran onthe 
squad is Mike Mross, the team's 
left footed booter. However, Doc-
tor SaroIli's ~reat coaching is 
quickly shaping up the rest olthe 
squad. In his training program, 
much emphasis is placed oncon-
ditioning and development of 
well-rounded players. To attain 
this goal much of the work-out 
consists of vigorous calistheniCS, 
special soccdr drills, and run-
ning. Sarolli expects each team 
mllmber to exercise by himself 
and run at least two miles each 
day. 

by freshmen players, and per-
haps by some more foreign play-
ers who usually comprise a lagge 
part of intercollegiate soccer 
teams. At this time, Grunewald 
is the only foreign player on the 
squad, having played for a num-
ber of years in Ecuador. 

Crew 
Wins 

The Tritons won their first 
crew match of the year last 
Saturday by edging UC Santa 
Barbara in an excellent showing 
by the UCSD llght weights. 

UCSD's Sailing Team hosted 
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate 
Yacht Raclng Association's ellm-
inatlons for tbe National Leyman 
10 Championships last weekend. 
The national championships will 
be sailed at Yale University this 
summer. Only the top two con-
tenders will be sent to the na-
tionals and they are USC and San 
Diego State. other colleges and 
universities vying for the chance 
were VCSD, UCI, Cal State at 
Long Beach, Claire mont Men's, 
and UCLA. 

UCSD placed fourth in the fleet 
with skippers Ken Holmes and 
Rich Reineman outshining many 
of the other skippers. Crews 
Cathy Topping and Chris Pendle-
ton had quite a job holding the 
boats down, particularly on Sun-
day when the fleet was met with 
moderate winds and at least five 
other classes of boats racing 
causing rough water. 

On individual scorlng, UCSD's 
Rich Reineman was lead only by 
one man in points ' for racing 
victories . UCS's Argyle Camp-
bell led Rich by only three points 
(49-46) with San Diego State 's 
Tom McLaughlin and Cal state's 
Eric Conn close behind with 44 
polnts. 

Final results were: (1) USC, (2) 
SOS, (3) CSLB, (4) UCSD, (5) 
UCLA, (6) UCI, (7) CMC. 

Coming this weekend are the 
PCIYRA slngle-handed champ-
ionships to be sailed at Santa

Spikers Vie at 
Invitational 

21 men from the UCSD track 
squad will represent the Tritons 
this Saturday at the Annual 
Orange Invitational Track Meet. 

39 events are scheduled, so a. 
number of athletes will be doub-
ling up. Tom Wolf, the only Tri-
ton to qualify for the NAIA Nation-
als so far this year, will be pre-
sent in his specialties: the long 
jump, triple jump, the 100 yd. 
dash, and the 440 relay. 

The tbinclads hope to bring 
back more medals than last year 
and the posslblity is very good 
as shown in some events . Warren 
Kumley has come on strong in 
the distance events the last couple 
of meets, and will try to place 
high in the grueling mile run. 
Steve (Bullet) Garfolo and Roy 
Dimon will be in the lield with 
the discu s, shot and javelin. Tom 
Gatlin may improve his time even 
more in the 440 yd. hurdles, in 
which he broke his own record 
two weeks ago. The team hopeful 
of the year, Marc Rothman, will 
set his Sights on a medal and the 
school record in the 440 yd dash, 
which has so far eluded him this 
season. 

The Tritons have finished their 
dual meet schedule for the sea-
son, and will spend the next few 
weeks at invitationals in pre-
paration tor the NAIA District 
meet on May 18, and the All-Cal 
Meet the following week. 

Another major goal which 
Sarolli is trying to attain is to 
teach his players to use their 
beads, not only to think, but to 
propel the ball. According to 
coach Sarolli more than 50% 
of the scoring is done with the 
head. In order that his players 
attain maximum proficiency in 
the use of their heads , Saroll1 
conducts numerous heading drill 
at every practice. 

The team is quickly getting 
ready for its first practice game 
which will be held early in May. 
By that time, the 11 starting 
players will have undergone rig-
orous training in the basics of the 
sport. Hopefully, when the team 
starts league competition next 
·all. the squad will be bolstered 

Presently, the squad still needs 
added depth in the half-back and 
forward positions. If anyone Is 
interested in joining the team, 
come out to, the Matthews Cam-
pus football field any Monday, 
Wednesday, or Friday from 3:30 
to 5:00 and sign up. No prllvious 
playing experience Is necessary! 

Racquet Men 
Become 

City Champs 
The UCSD Tritons took the 

official city championship Tues-
day by beating powerful San Diego 
Mesa College in a scrimage 
matCh. 

Mesa had a season record of 
20 wins with 1 loss this year, 
and had just come from winning 
the JC Championship at Ojai 
this last weekend. 

The Tritons defeated Mesa 5-4, 
with the deciding match being the 
first doubles match. The team of 
Terre-Hoffman defeated Logan-
McLoughlin in a major upset 
10-8, 0-6, and 6-4. Logan and Mc-
Loughlin won the Ojai doubles. 

Wednesday the netters played 
Cal Western, which should have 
proved no problem, and wlU 
finish up their regular season 
next week on Tuesday and Wed-
nesday with matches against 
Chapman and San Diego State. 

May 11 will find the Tritons 
competing at Cal Luthern in 
Thousand Oaks in the NAlA Re-
gional Championships. 

Held last saturday, April 27 
on Lake Cachuma on the Santa 
Barbara campus, the meet was 
quite a morale booster for the 
first year team. This was the 
first win for the UCSD crew in 
this, their first year of rowing. 
In comparison, VCSB did not win 
its first race until this year, their 
thrid year of competition. 

UCSB opened with a 40-stroke 
per minute start and jumped to 
an early 3/ 4 boat length lead. 

UCSD, rowing at 32 strokes per 
minute closed the gap to 1/2 
boat length at the 500 meter mark 
of the 2000 meter race. By then, 
UCSB had dropped to 36 strokes 
perminute, and UCSD pulled even 
at the halfway mark. (1000 met-
ers), still stroking at a steady 
32. 

During the second half of the 
race, UCSD pulled ahead to a 
1/2 boat length lead at 1500 
meters and finished about 3/4 
lengths ahead. Both crews raised 
their strokes to 38/ minute in the 
final 100 meters. 

The freshman race saw UCSD 
pull ahead by 2 seats on the first 
sta.rt, but the race had to be 
stopped when a power launch 
inadvertantly pulled in Iront of 
the shells. The second start was 
even, with both crews stroking 
at 32. UCSB pulled ahead by 1/ 2 
length at 500 meters, 1 1/2 at 
1000, and finished 3 boat-lengths 
ahead of the Tritons. 

The Light-weight Varsity Race 
saw UCSD finish first in the 
time of 6:54, with UC Santa 
Barban caught in 6:57:3. The 
Heavy-weight Freshmen race had 
UCSB on 6:58, while the Tritons 
finished with a 7: 13 clocking.

university. A department of An-
thropology may also be created 
next year, however, the Revelle 
provost could give no answer as 
to sho will head this department. 
The professor in question has 
not as yet accepted the univer-
sity's offer. The Department of 
History is to suffer the loss of 
two professors, Mr. Barraclough 
and Mr. Peters. Salt man said that 
both were very fine professors 
lnd that their departure would be 
a considerable loss to that de-
partment and the university. 

Questions concerning the ef-

SD Gymnasium 
Opm By May 15 

Barring any unforeseen diffi-
culties, the UCSD gymnasium 
will be opened by May 15. 

The dates given to the Triton 
Times were between the 15th 
and the 1st of June, but P .E. 
Chairman Dr. Forbes is confident 
that the building will be usable 
for the Cal Tjade r concert the 
17th. 

lects of cuts into the budget of 
the UC system touched a very 
sensitive nerve. Provost Salt-
man is definitely bitter over the 
fact that although the university 
voluntarily cut its request for 
positions for new full-time pro-
fes sors from 78 to 56, the legis-
lature cut that number still fur-
ther to 15. According toSaltman, 
this severely limits the ability 
to continue its planned expansion 
and is also very unfair when it is 
considered that UCLA can at 
any time hire 120 full-time pro-
fessors because of absences 
which have not been refilled and 
new positions given to them. 

Provost Saltman added also 
that the number of T .A.s the 
university could hire next year 
had been cut from 77 to 70 in 
what he considered an act of re-
venge by the legislature because 
of the participation of T .A.s in the 
dis~i.1rbances on the Berke ley 
campus. Finally, Saltman c; tated 
that the UC administration is 
attempting to redirect students to 
the smaller branches of the UC 
syste m such as the San Diego 
campus. This is to be accompan-
ied by increased in the budgets 
of the r espective campuses.

MEMO FROM WARD BEECHER: 
A student committee is currently 
discussing a student center. Ei-
ther adjacent to it or connected 
with it w111 be the International 
student Center. Committee mem-
bers are trying to find out at this 
point what il~ms should be in-
cluded or what portions of the 
Center should be included which 
would be either exclusively for 
foreign students or where foreIgn 
students would ha ve priority of 
use. There Is some urgency in 
this, so your suggestions will 
be appreCiated. 

In 1969 this campus is going 
to participate in the International 
Week in connection with the 200th 
anniversary of San Diego. Any 
ideas as to how we may best do 
this on this campus will be wel-
comed. Also in connection with 
that same program, we are going 
to be asked to participate in an 
international parade. Any sug-
gestions for floats, costumes, 
etc. will be appreciated.
