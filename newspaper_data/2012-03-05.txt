Day of  Action

SPECIAL ELECTION

D-I Email 
Violated 
Election 
Guidelines

BY ANGELA CHEN
Editor in Chief

The pro-referendum email sent to an all-campus 
listserv by 2009-10 A.S. President Utsav Gupta violates 
election guidelines, the A.S. Elections Committee 

ruled on March 4. The Judicial 
Board will hear the case and 
rule on the sanctions, if any, on 
March 7. 

Gupta’s Feb. 29 email urged 
students to vote “yes” in the 
ongoing special election, citing 
the benefits of higher U.S. News 
& World rankings and national 
prestige if the referendum passes. 
On March 3, Public Education 
Coalition member Kevin Quirolo 
filed a grievance against Gupta to 
the Elections Committee, alleg-

ing that the email is a breach of neutrality and that 
Gupta may have accessed the listserv improperly. 
Gupta, who graduated in 2011, currently works as the 
UCSD Bay Area Alumni Outreach Officer. 

According to UCSD’s Policy and Records 
Administration, the “all-official-l” listserv includes 
all individuals —  including students — with UCSD 
emails, and is usually reserved for campus notices. The 
site states that prior approval is necessary and must be 
approved by a relevant vice chancellor.

Quirolo also said that many of Gupta’s claims were 
false. According to Quirolo, advancing to Division I 
will not automatically lead to a higher spot in the News 
& World Report, as the magazine does not take sports 
rankings into account.

“This [development] makes it difficult for me to 
accept election results as entirely neutral and valid,” 

MONDAY, MARCH 5, 2012 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORGVOLUME 45, ISSUE 37

Over 300 students, faculty and staff members pro-tested against continuing cuts to public education at the March 1 Day of Action. The events included a virtual sit-in that began at midnight before the 
protest, a rally and a march around campus. The national Day 
of Action campaign marked the first campus-wide mobiliza-
tion since the March 4 Day of Action in 2010, when as many 

as 800 people participated in the walkout at 
UCSD. 

“We need to keep up the struggle to 
demonstrate that public education is a social 
priority, a political priority and an economic 
priority,” Public Education Coalition member 
Kevin Quirolo said at Thursday’s rally. “Public 

education is not going to fight for itself. Last year we forgot 
that, and [the state] cut our funding by hundreds of millions 
of dollars.”

Organizers coordinate with faculty, student orgs to plan demonstrations in support of 
affordable public higher education. By nicole chan • Associate News Editor

“DO YOU 
SUPPORT THE 

DIVISION-I 
REFERENDUM?” 



About 150 protesters attended the 
11:30 a.m. rally organized by the PEC. 
Protesters at the Silent Tree carried 
signs with messages such as “I do not 
let A.S. speak for me” and “California: 
#1 prison funding, #48 education.” The 
crowd doubled in an hour, with up to 
400 people in attendance before the 
planned campus march. 

Literature professor Luis Cabrera 
spoke in support of the protest by 
directly addressing fellow faculty 
members.

“If we want change, we need to 
put our bodies on the line with the 
students and workers,” Cabrera said. 
“It is time to disobey. If students are 
arrested, we should be arrested.”

One uniformed university police 
officer was in attendance; protest-
ers later discovered a man in plain 
clothes to be a university police 
officer. According to the Daily 
Californian, UCSD spokesperson 
Jeff Gattas said that police officers 
dressed in plain clothes are always 
present at gatherings.

According to Quirolo, March 1 
began as a national call to action 
by Berkeley-based group Occupy 
Education, and included demonstra-

tions across New York and Ohio, as 
well as on the UC, Cal State and com-
munity college campuses. According 
to the Daily Californian, protesters at 
UC Santa Cruz shut down incoming 
and outgoing traffic to the campus 
from 4:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 

Quirolo said that the PEC began 
planning the Day of Action — which 
was mostly student-organized —after 
hosting Radical Rush Week at the 
beginning of Winter Quarter. 

PEC member Sean Estelle said 
that the organization formed com-
mittees to reach out to professors, 
publicize the event to students and 
discuss marching routes and reclama-
tion spaces. 

Estelle said that faculty involve-
ment in Thursday’s events was crucial 
to the strength of the movement. 
According to Estelle, members of the 
PEC used templates from teachthe-
budget.com to email professors and 
ask them hold class outside in con-
junction with the rally. 

“We’re in this position where 
more and more faculty are starting 
to side with the students — student 
debt is larger than credit card debt 
— they understand what we’re going 
through, they can feel for us,” Estelle 
said.  

The PEC also collaborated 
with visual arts professor Ricardo 
Dominguez to hold a virtual sit-in, 
an electronic form of civil disobedi-
ence. In 2010, Dominguez staged a 
virtual sit-in on the website of UC 
President Mark G. Yudof. The 2010 
sit-in disrupted the site’s operations, 
and Dominguez was later under uni-
versity investigations for suspicion of 
criminal activity.  

This year’s virtual sit-in, which 
ends on March 5 at 11:59 p.m., tar-
gets bankofamerica.com, jerrybrown.
org and universityofcalifornia.edu.

Around 30 to 60 members of the 
PEC “reclaimed” the Chancellor’s 
Complex around 3 p.m. Thursday 
afternoon. They submitted a list 
of six demands that the chan-
cellor must meet by March 8 in 
order for the protesters to vacate 
the building. According to the 
“Statement of Intentions from the 
Reclaimers’ Complex to the UCSD 
Administration,” drafted March 1, 
if campus administration does not 
meet the demands, the PEC will 
escalate actions against the admin-
istration.

“It’s a huge deal though, that 
the conference room is successfully 
reclaimed,” Estelle said. “We’re in the 

heart of the university, and we’re not 
going away.”

The demands call for the support 
of under-funded departments and 
continued free services provided by 
OASIS, as well as overall changes in 
the UC system. The organizers are 
waiting on a written statement from 
the administration.

According to Estelle, Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Gary Ratcliff was in attendance at 
the general assembly held at the 
Chancellor’s Complex on Thursday. 
PEC members are encouraging the 
administration to continue using the 
space as normal. 

“They’re still using their offices 
and seem to be ignoring us,” Estelle 
said. “Nothing has been done and 
there has been extremely minimal 
police involvement.”

Students from the PEC, SAAC, 
A.S. Council, Student Organized 
Voter Access Committee and others 
left for Sacramento on Saturday for 
the Student Lobbying Conference. 

According to Estelle, up to 10,000 
students will rally state legislators 
and occupy the capital today.

Quirolo said. “I’ve been campaigning 
and trying to get the word out and this 
is an example of information people 
are receiving that is problematic.” 

The Elections Committee reviewed 
the case on March 4. The committee 
consists of seven students: Advocate 
General Courtney Hill, who chairs the 
board and does not have a vote, and 
one representative from each of the six 
colleges. Hill said that the board does 
not have information on how Gupta 
accessed the listserv.

“We agreed that a violation had 
been committed, so we sent it to the 
J-Board, which is the next step,” Hill 
said. 

In his grievance,   Quirolo asked 
the Elections Committee to publicize 
the letter-writing campaign he 
began in response to the email, and 
to denounce Gupta’s email as an 
“improper effort by a UCSD employee 
to influence a student election.” Hill 
declined to comment on possible 
sanctions.

The hearing will be held March 7 
at 7 p.m. in the Student Leadership 
Chambers on the fourth floor of Price 
Center East. Hill said that Gupta has 
the opportunity to be present for his 
hearing and defend his case, which 
may present logistical problems as he 
is based in the Bay Area. 

Students can vote in the special 
election — which asks if they are will-
ing to pay an additional $495 annually 
to fund UCSD’s move to D-I athletics 
— on TritonLink until March 9. 

Gupta could not be reached for com-
ment.

LIGHTS & SIRENS

Several “Occupy UC Davis” protesters involved in last year’s pepper 
spray incident have filed a lawsuit against the administrators and police 
officers involved. Students vs. UC Davis Officials & Police — filed Feb. 
22 by 19 Davis students and alumni —  claims the university and its 
officers used excessive force and restricted free speech by not respect-
ing students’ right to protest.

Also named in the suit is UC Police Lt. John Pike, the officer who 
was recorded blasting pepper spray at over a dozen Davis Occupy pro-
testers on Nov. 18. Videos of the spraying went viral, and were iconic 
for many Occupy Movement supporters.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Feb. 23 that Pike, UCD 
Police Chief Annette Spicuzza and another officer involved have all 
been put on administrative leave with pay while the investigation con-
tinues. One of the plaintiffs is UC Davis student David Buscho, who 
was pepper sprayed during the protest.

“It was extremely painful and totally disorienting,” Buscho told the 
Los Angeles Times.

Meanwhile, the faculty at UC Davis voted 697 to 312 in favor of 
continued support for Katehi as chancellor last month. Only around 
50 percent of UCD faculty members participated in the Feb. 16 
No-Confidence vote, which was made available through email to the 
entire faculty.

During the same poll, UCD faculty also voted to condemn the pep-
per spray incident, the police and their use of excessive force in the 
protests.

UC President Mark G. Yudof released a statement on Feb. 16 sup-
porting Katehi and the UCD faculty.

“She has my full support,” Yudof wrote. “In response to recent 
protest-related controversies, the chancellor has demonstrated both 
her integrity as a leader and her personal empathy for all members of 
the UC Davis community.”

Last year, Yudof hired a task force to investigate the incident and 
provide feedback for future conflict prevention and management as 
well as suggested course of action on the pepper spray issue. On Feb. 
15, task force chair and former California Supreme Court Justice Cruz 
Reynoso sent Yudof a letter updating him on the force’s progress.

“The Task Force believes that it is imperative to have a complete 
understanding of the events that took place on that afternoon,” 
Reynoso wrote. 

Reynoso said that a full report would be released in early March. 
According to the UCD website, the report would be available for down-
load from the UC Davis website on March 6.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, MARCH 5,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Lately, the blogosphere has been abuzz with the news of “Taste the Lin-sanity” frozen yogurt, concocted in honor of rising NBA superstar Jeremy 
Lin, and demoed by the Harvard Square branch of Ben and Jerry’s earlier this 
month. The offending yogurt was excoriated for being a racist concoction — it 
contained chunks of fortune cookies and swirls of lychee honey.

The extreme commentators need to calm down. Many have a self-serving 
interest to fan the flames of controversy, to spin tales of juicy racially charged 
"scandals" when they don't really exist. Their allegations shouldn’t be taken at 
face value. 

Take the reaction to ESPN analyst Max Bretos’s on-air statement that 
Lin's nine turnovers during a game constituted a "chink in the armor" for his 
team, the New York Knicks. A number of sports news websites immediately 
published articles condemning Bretos as a crude bigot. Days later, Bretos’s 
side of the story came out: "chink in the armor" was a cliche he had used 
frequently to describe defensive weaknesses — a quick search of his transcripts 
revealed he had used it previously to describe players of a variety of races over 
a hundred times.

Incorrectly accusing people as bigots is a cheap but easy way to increase 
article views. What the commentators don't see — or rather, intentionally 
refuse to see — is that whoever did decide to add fortune cookies to the Lin-
sanity flavor mix was trying to make a not-so-subtle nod to the basketball 
superstar's Taiwanese and Chinese heritage, and nothing more.

It may not have been a celebration of his heritage, but it certainly wasn't an 
attempt to disparage it either. As the branch manager later explained, the chef 
in question was probably just "swept up in the nationwide Lin-sanity."

Public Should Not Take “Lin-sanity” Flavor Too Seriously Company Knows Better Than a Racially-Charged Flavor 

Ben & Jerry’s apologized last week for putting fortune cookies and lychee honey swirls in pints of its “Taste the Lin-Sanity” ice cream sold at its 
Harvard Square, Massachusetts, location. While some customers insisted 
that the new flavor was intended as a fun tribute to the heritage of basketball 
sensation Jeremy Lin, others were outraged by what they saw as political 
incorrectness. As the national media weighs in, it has become increasingly 
apparent that Ben & Jerry’s should have refrained from using stereotypical 
Asian ingredients to avoid the public relations setback.

This is not the first time Ben & Jerry's has faced controversy. Last year, 
the company introduced its “Schweddy Balls” ice cream, which served as 
homage to an old “Saturday Night Live” skit featuring Alec Baldwin as 
fictional bakery owner Pete Schweddy. Besides offending people with the 
same last name, the ice cream’s title sparked criticism over its vulgarity. 
Other controversial Ben & Jerry's flavors include “Hubby Hubby” — in 
support of gay marriage — and “Karmel Sutra.”

Lin is the first American-born NBA player of Taiwanese and Chinese 
descent, and Ben & Jerry's wanted to honor his recent rise to stardom. But 
it’s not surprising that some people took offense at the fact that fortune 
cookies — which are generally served in Chinese restaurants in the United 
States — were in the contents of “Taste the Lin-Sanity.” The fortune cookies 
in the new flavor have since been replaced by waffle cookies. 

Regardless of its intentions, the overwhelmingly negative public and 
media reaction to “Taste the Lin-Sanity” has caused public relations troubles 
for Ben & Jerry’s. Even the ice cream company’s wackiest flavors have to be 
marketable in order for the company to continue to make profits.

Week Nine is a strange time for me. Finals loom, so every minute spent rolling 
my eyes at Pinterest wedding photos 
is tainted with guilt. Yet �nals are 
just far enough away that a master 
of rationalization such as myself can 
claim that, “somehow,” War and Peace 
will “get read.”

�us is the story of my last eight 
quarters. But this week I combined 
my two hobbies (procrastination, 

and guilt over procrastination) into a 
more useful endeavor: While I’m not 
actually studying, I’m reading up on 
how I can study better (in the future). 

�e good news: �e most e�ective 
way to learn is to play a game of 
strategic procrastination. An entire 
industry of �ash card programs  has 
grown around the idea of “spaced 
repetition,” which states that the 
best way to remember anything is 
to relearn it just when you’ve almost 
forgotten the concept. 

�e theory comes from Hermann 
Ebbinghaus, who studied the time 
it took students to consistently 
remember nonsense syllables. 
�ere are two types of long-term 
memory involved here: retrieval and 
storage. Retrieval is how quickly 
we can remember the Russian 
word for “milk,” while storage 
denotes how long “молоко” will 
stay in our memories, even if we 
can’t pull up the word right away. 
Spaced repetition works on both: 
By reminding ourselves of concepts 
when we’re about to lose them, we 
simultaneously pull the idea up from 
the depths (recall) and root them 
more deeply (strength).

�e harder we struggle to 
understand the material, the longer 
the material will stick — this is why 
memory researchers recommend 
taking notes a�er class instead of 
during. �e latter turns the student 
into a scribe, while the former forces 
her to actively think about the lecture. 
Similarly, the best way to prepare is 
to stop studying and quiz yourself; 
this removes the danger of confusing 
familiarity with understanding. 

Other illuminations, from Robert 
Bjork of the UCLA Learning and 
Forgetting Lab: Studying in di�erent 
environments improves retention, 
and interweaving di�erent, but 
related, skills while practicing is 
more e�ective than learning skills in 
blocks. Practicing short division, then 
long division, then short division 
in a short span will “set” the skills 
in the brain more de�nitively than 
practicing them separately for longer 
periods. 

But at the end of the day, there 
was one major area in which science 
let me down. All the studies say that 
cramming, while e�ective in the short 
term, hurts retention in the long run. 
Reading about memory studies will 
not actually negate my upcoming 
cram session. Instead, I am more 
doomed than ever for the looming 
tests, but more prepared for Spring 
Quarter — when my newfound 
knowledge and discipline will kick in 
and save me.

QUICK TAKES LAST WEEK, THE HARVARD SQUARE BRANCH OF BEN & JERRY’S RELEASED A JEREMY LIN-INSPIRED “TASTE THE LIN-SANITY” FROZEN YOGURT FLAVOR THAT CONTAINED FORTUNE COOKIE CRUMBS AND LYCHEE SWIRLS.

EDITORIAL

There’s been a lot of talk about what’s “best” for UCSD and how athlet-ics play into the future of 
our institution. We can divide the 
controversy into two different camps: 
those who believe in a near future for 
Division I sports and the benefits it 
could bring, and those who believe 
we have more immediate priorities.

We’re just a week into the special 
election that will determine which 
path the campus will take, and the 
divide rages on. Many are sticking to 
their guns (turning Facebook into a 
virtual war zone), while others — like 
this Editorial Board — are open to 
considering new arguments. Though 
we initially expressed hesitant sup-
port of the referendum in our 
November editorial, “D-I Athletics: A 
Lasting Investment,” with the knowl-
edge gained through increased cover-
age of the issue, we’ve had a change 
of heart.

No one can deny the appeal 
of D-I athletics. With 29 national 
championships, UCSD has clearly 
outgrown its competitors in the 
D-II California College Athletic 
Association. Our men’s water polo 
and women’s soccer teams are some 
of the best in the division, and 
women’s basketball was ranked No. 
1 in the nation until a heartbreaking 
loss on Friday. 

We’ve also outgrown D-II 
academically. Since we moved to 
Division II in 2000, we’ve been the 
only UC school in the division (UC 
Santa Cruz competes in D-III, UC 
Merced competes in NAIA, UC San 
Francisco doesn’t have athletics at 
all and the rest compete in D-I), and 
our statistics don’t match with our 

competition, which consists mostly 
of Cal States. The average enrollment 
for CCAA colleges is 15,000 under-
graduates, while we have nearly dou-
ble that at 28,000. Academically, the 
average 75th percentile verbal SAT 
score for CCAA is 528 — UCSD’s is 
660. For math the average is 542 — 
UCSD is again higher at 710. 

We’ve made these arguments 
before. Comparisons to other D-II 
schools are borne out of a reasonable 
desire to compete with schools along 
the same level as UCSD, such as UC 
Davis. But in the wake of protests like 
those held on March 1, such com-
parisons seem irrelevant now. The 
connection between academics and 
athletics is tenuous at best — even 
if there are colleges with strong aca-
demics and strong athletics, the two 
aren’t required to correlate. Harvey 
Mudd and MIT, for example, com-
pete in D-III, and no one is knocking 
their prestige. Meanwhile, many D-I 
schools are athletics powerhouses 
with horrible academics, such as 
Oklahoma State University and 
University of Arizona — schools we 
consistently dominate on rankings. 

What’s worse, almost all D-I 
programs run at a deficit. In 2006, 
only 19 of 119 D-I programs in the 
country made money. Given the 
current budget crisis, now is clearly 

not the time to make such a giant 
financial gamble. Just this last fall, 
fees increased by 17.6 percent, and 
UCOP told the Regents that if the 
state didn’t provide more funding, 
fees would continue to rise by 16 
percent annually. So with our fees ris-
ing relentlessly as it is, the additional 
$495 each undergraduate would pay 
annually could be another $495 many 
have to take out in loans. 

D-I could bring great things to 
UCSD — but, for lack of a better 
punch line, not now. And many of 
the “great things” outlined by the pro 
campaign — increased school spirit 
and university recognition — are 
intangible; you can’t measure “spirit,” 
so it’d be impossible to quantify the 
differences the move could make 
to the daily life of the average, 
non-athlete on campus, especially 
since the move would not include 
a football team and would not have 
us competing against Cal or UCLA. 
And though D-I proponents often 
point to the “Flutie effect” (as we did 
in our November editorial) — the 
assumption that athletic success leads 
to name recognition, prestige and 
spending — a 2004 study of nine D-I 
conferences found that the Flutie 
effect might not be statistically viable. 

Keep the 
Change

Upon further reflection of  the arguments presented for and against the 
Division-I referendum, the Editorial Board has decided to retract our 

November 2011 editorial in support of  the referendum.

Memory’s the 
Test When 
Students Are 
Studying



THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, MARCH 5,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

UCSD has no need to reinvent itself at this point anyway. 
People still want to come here despite it being known as 
an “academic” school (a record 75,987 students applied to 
UCSD in Fall 2011 — an overall increase of nearly 8 percent 
from the previous year), and we have a very long future 
ahead of us to reinvent ourselves later. “Not now” doesn’t 
mean “never.” It means “not when we’re in a deep, crippling 
financial crisis.”

The notion that our degrees are meaningless without a 
kickass basketball team — an idea supported by many on 
the pro side, including former A.S. president Utsav Gupta — 
is completely ridiculous. Just last month, UCSD was ranked 
eighth for salary earning potential in the 2011-12 PayScale 
study measuring top state schools across the nation. 
Executive director of UC San Diego Alumni Affairs Armin 

Afsahi told UCSD news that it’s our “prominent academic 
programs” that are preparing students to fulfill their career 
goals. While school spirit and athletic prestige are impor-
tant, a guaranteed future without a hefty price tag during a 
recession is all most students really need. 

“One of the greatest measures of a university is the qual-
ity of its graduates,” Afsahi said. “Our alumni are not only 
going on to achieve great success, they are also advancing 
their communities, creating jobs and building our economy.”

If that’s not something to have spirit about, we don’t 
know what is. 

While this Editorial Board will be voting “No,” we 
encourage students to make up their own minds about 
where their priorities lie and vote in the special election on 
Triton Link. Tell your friends to vote. It’s crucial that this 
significant decision is made by the majority of the student 
body, and not just by the majority of the people who voted.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
A new law has dealt a grievous 

blow to nearly half of the for-profit 
college campuses in the state, 
barring them from offering students 
a coveted Cal Grant this year. And 
I am so glad that SB70 cracks down 
for the first time on schools with 
high student loan default rates. 
From now on, California is tying 
participation in the Cal Grant 
program to colleges’ three-year 
student loan default rates. No public 
campuses are affected by the law, 
but 40 percent of California’s for-
profits colleges are. Of 165 such 
campuses in this state, 67 have 
three-year default rates of at least 
24.6 percent, the legal cutoff. They 
include some or all campuses of 
Kaplan Higher Education.

Students at for-profit colleges get 
about $4,000 to $10,000 in state aid 
on average, depending on the type 
of grant. When SB70 took effect this 
fall, about 4,900 students applying 
to for-profit colleges became 
ineligible or were offered a partial 
grant if they were already enrolled. 
Healds in Fresno and Stockton had 
default rates high enough to cost 
them their Cal Grants. More than 
1,300 students at the two campuses 
were eligible to receive $6.2 million. 
But that was last year. Gov. Jerry 
Brown also wants to reduce Cal 
Grant awards for private education 
and make it harder for students to 
qualify for some awards by raising 
the grade-point average needed to 
qualify. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsome 
thinks the grade-point averages as 
stringent Brown wants will lead to 
grade inflation.

It would be perverse to allow 
the requirements for colleges 
to get weaker while proposing 
the requirements for students 

to become more stringent. 
Participation in the Cal Grant 
program and its costs has 
increased from 177,000 students 
and $688 million in 2004 to an 
estimated 256,000 students and 
$1.6 billion presently. Brown has 
proposed to lower the amount-in-
aid for students attending private 
California colleges through the Cal 
Grants program to about the Cal 
State level or $4,000 — preferably 
the lower figure. 

In order to collect federal Title 
IV aid — Pell grants, Stafford loans 
and Plus loans — for-profit colleges 
must obey the “90/10” rule:  They 
can’t derive more than 90 percent 
of their total income from Title IV 
programs. GI Bill funds don’t count 
toward that total. So every dollar 
from the Department of Veteran 
Affairs enables for-profit colleges 
to collect nine dollars from the 
U.S. Department of Education. In 
2009, the for-profits took in almost 
as much money as did all of the 
public colleges in the 50 states of 
the union — even though they 
enrolled about one-third as many 
veterans. Online learning appeals to 
for-profit college CEOs that see the 
combination of guaranteed funding 
from student aid and low-cost part-
time “professors” as a huge money-
making opportunity.

STATE OF THE 
UNIVERSITYUNIVERSITY

Among several speakers, Sean Estelle was an energetic force on the podium at the March 1 “Rally for Higher Education,” 
leading chants and marching in the frontlines 
of the protest. Estelle, a third year Sixth College 
Visual Arts and Theater major, has been a promi-
nent figure in recent student protests at UCSD 
geared at reversing fee hikes and encouraging 
more investment into public education. 

As a member of the Outreach Committee for 
the Public Education Coalition, a UCSD-based 
organization that started at the beginning of 
Fall Quarter 2011, Estelle has been leading ral-
lies, creating Facebook events and talking to the 
press on behalf of the PEC. On Dec. 5, when 
students staged a non-violent break-in of the 
recently closed Center for Library & Instructional 
Computing Services (CLICS), Estelle was a key 
player in the “reclamation,” claiming he probably 
slept there every night following the action.

As a student activist who calls for protest, 
and civil disobedience by fellow students as an 
agent of change, Estelle’s philosophy on what he 
and other activists call the recent “privatization” 
of education is similar to the “Occupy” rhetoric 
that has been emerging throughout the state of 
California and the nation as a whole.

“It really is starting to turn into a statewide 
and a nationwide and even global movement,” 
said Estelle.

Estelle and the rest of the PEC, which includes 
undergraduates, graduate and Ph.D students and 
members of faculty and staff, are part of a larger 
movement of activism at UC campuses, which 
has entailed clashes with protesters and campus 
police. The infamous pepper spray incident at 
UC Davis and the subsequent call for the res-
ignation of Chancellor Linda Katehi garnered 
extensive media attention, creating lingering ten-
sions between UC students and administration 

throughout the state.
Alfredo Mireles Jr., the current Student Regent 

on the UC Board of regents does not subscribe to 
exactly the same type of activism that Estelle and 
similar activists call for, but acknowledges many 
of the grievances brought forth by the PEC and 
organizations at the other UC campuses as legiti-
mate evidence of the need for change.

 In discussing privatization, Estelle cites fig-
ures from teachthebudget.com, a website that 
explains the UC-wide budget crisis and outlines 
the frustrations with UC administration that have 
driven students from across the state to partici-
pate in protests and sit-ins. The site lists figures, 
like the recent salary raises for 12 highly ranked 
UC administrators and attorneys in December 
of 2011, as indicative of a mishandling of the UC 
budget. He also mentions that, as defined by the 
California constitution, the current structuring of 
the Board of Regents is not representative of the 
students, staff and faculty.

 “[A majority of] the board of regents are 
appointed, they’re not democratically elected,” 
Estelle said. “Only four are democratically elected 
regents, and there’s one Student Regent.”

 A UCSF graduate student, Mireles echoes 
Estelle’s disapproval. As the Student Regent, his 
vote is equal to those of the other 25 regents, but 
he explained that his role is the only one among 
the regents that is designed to represent the UC 
student population of 220,000 as his specific con-
stituency. The Student Regent position, like the 
other regents, is an appointed position, though 
the selection process entails a greater deal of 
student involvement. He is reviewed by A.S. presi-
dents of various councils, as well as the University 
of California Student Association. 

Alongside him, Jonathan Stein, graduate stu-
dent at UC Berkeley, serves as a Student Regent-
Designate. He is currently a non-voting member 

of the Board of Regents, but will become a voting 
student regent once his term begins in July of  this 
year. Mireles said that he is often outvoted by the 
other regents, indicating a discrepancy between 
his agenda as a Student Regent and the agendas of 
the other regents. 

“We all support access, affordability and qual-
ity of the university,” Mireles said. “Every regent 
supports that. But each regent emphasizes dif-
ferent aspects of that system. Whereas I think 
affordability is the most important component of 
that three-idea system, many of the other regents 
prioritize quality over affordability.”

511% since 1999

$760 million was cut from

In 2011, 12 administrators 
received raises between 
6.4% and 23%

There is only 1 student 
regent out of 26 total 

In the mids t of an economic crisis, California universities have taken 
a big blow. Multiple parties have weighed in on possible solutions but 

even defining the problem can be a lofty task.

SPRING
BREAK?

UNCOMMON FOLK

BY STACEY CHIEN
Staff Writer

On terrain where colossal skyscrapers appear to spring up instantaneously and indoor ski slopes are preserved 
on desert sands, possibilities seem endless. 
For many years in Dubai, the only apparent 
direction was up. That is, until the economy 
— which is built on the oil industry — col-
lapsed. A wave of panic swept over its inhab-
itants, though masked by the glitz and glam 
of the city. Many onlookers were (and still 
are) unclear as to what lies behind the glisten-
ing veil of extravagance and wealth. Artist 
and Filmmaker Katy Chang, a UCSD alumna, 
might have some answers. Her feature-length 
documentary, “Glitter Dust: Finding Art in 
Dubai,” examines the underlying social issues 
of Dubai by following the lives of three strug-
gling artists.

“Art is the lens where we look at all these 
social issues of society there, like censorship, 
treatment of women, treatment of workers,” 
Chang said. “And it’s not just society there in 
Dubai; it’s about modern society — how we 
have all this monetary capital that’s driving 
all this growth and how cultural capital — 
the artists that are critically examining these 

changes in society — isn’t being supported 
except from the ground up by these artists.”

Chang began filming in Dubai in 2009 
and calls her film a “drawcumentary,” as it 
integrates hand-drawn images with live foot-
age.

“I’ve always been interested in making art 
that looks at art,” Chang said. “But also, I had 
to confront the limitations of filming without 
permits. It was completely unauthorized, so I 
thought, ‘Well, I need to tell this story, and I 
need to collaborate on it.’ So I drew on top of 
it, and it allowed me to put my voice onto the 
film because there’s no narrator in the film. I 
just wanted people to speak very honestly by 
themselves, so I expressed my point of view 
the best way I knew how by drawing and by 
animation.”

Chang’s interest in the arts began in her 
early childhood. At the age of two, she started 
doodling on the scrap paper that her mother 
would bring home from work. Her doodling 
escalated to studying art at the University of 
Maryland and in 2002, receiving an MFA in 
video and performance art at UCSD, where 
she met her husband, the producer and edi-
tor of the documentary. She then went on to 
study art law in her hometown of Washington 
D.C.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, MARCH 5,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

The March 1 list of demands drafted by the PEC 
calls for an investigation into the regents’ con-
flicts of interests. Estelle cites Monica Lozano 
as an example of said conflict. Lozano, who, 
in addition to her current role as a regent, also 
serves as a director for Bank of America — a 
corporation that profits from student loans. 
Because of these ties, he insists that the current 
regents should all resign from their positions. 
For the system to be truly representative, Estelle 
said, students, staff and faculty should have 
greater representation, holding at least 51 per-
cent of the votes in the board of regents.

Mireles agreed with Estelle and other stu-
dents that one student regent among a board of 
26 is a flawed system.

“It’s insane that there’s only one student 
regent,” Mireles said. “The board is too big, 
there’s too much influence from Sacramento 
and very little influence from students.”

 But while Mireles agrees with protesting 
students that there is room for change at the 
UC level, cuts by the state and the federal 
government have made it increasingly hard for 
regents to keep fees from rising. 

 “I’ve read some studies that say there’s 
been some growth in administration,” Mireles 
said. “That is a valid criticism — we have seen 
administration grow in both size and incomes, 
which are already way too high in my per-
spective. But that only scratches the surface 
of everything that’s been happening and why 
college is more unaffordable. We got cut $760 
million, over 30 percent, in one year. That is, 
in nobody’s mind, a sustainable way to run an 
organization. All of the chancellors can get paid 
nothing and the problems will still remain.”

California and national budget crises that 
limit university funding are forces to be reck-
oned with, and Estelle acknowledges that along 
with a change to the UC system, institutional 
change is necessary at the state level, espe-
cially in encouraging legislatures to funnel 
more money into the educational system. But 
both individuals agree to a dire need for local 
change, despite current economic challenges.

The question presented by students who 
don’t see how a rally or reclamation can imple-
ment that change remains: Do these protests 
actually work?

 “Lobbying to administrators and having 
call-ins is not a form of direct action,” Estelle 
said. “That’s politely coming to the structures 
and hierarchies in power. Instead, with rallies 
and marches and reclamations of buildings 
they’re constructing, we’re saying, ‘We’re not 
okay with this and we’re going to do something 
about this. You’ll have to listen to us.’”

 And for Estelle, breaking the law — in the 
case of breaking into CLICS or the Chancellor’s 
Complex — is a legitimate means to an end, 

as long as “it’s not doing harm to any human 
being,” Estelle said.

 “Civil disobedience is the breaking of 
unjust laws because you feel that there is a 
higher law, namely that of human rights and 
solitary and the willingness to give people a 
chance and fight back against these institu-
tional structures,” Estelle said.

 Mireles supports the non-violent protests 
of UC students as a legitimate tool of commu-
nication to those in power the need to imple-
ment necessary changes. But he also believes 
that such actions can sometimes inhibit the 
very change that students call for, and that 
strategies don’t hold the students’ interests.

For example, on Jan. 19 student protests 
interrupted a regents meeting, leading to a 
relocation of the meeting as well as students 
being barred from the meeting.

Mireles was condemned by an article in 
the Daily Californian, UC Berkeley’s official 
newspaper, for his silence during a regents 
meeting in September of 2011 that discussed 
possible fee increases of 16 percent. But 
Alfredo explained that as the Student Regent, 
he intends to work with the board on behalf of 
the students, avoiding a manner of communi-
cation that would inhibit dialogue.

“Be cautious that you don’t sabotage your 
ability to be successful in advocating [your 
cause],” Mireles said. “You might be alienating 
the people you’re trying to influence.”

Meanwhile, Student Regent-designate 
Jonathan Stein is working on developing 
another possible solution to the funding crisis 
for the UC system. Stein is in the process of 
developing a Political Action Committee (PAC) 
for the UC system. A PAC, an organization that 
campaigns and increases leverage for a specific 
institution, could theoretically provide the UC 
system the leverage it needs within the state 
government to promote state funding of the 
public universities. 

In terms of direct student action, Mireles 
advocates the power of student protest as 
a means to influence the regents in power, 
while Estelle’s philosophy is geared more 
toward changing the current power structure 
completely. Currently, the Public Education 
Coalition is engaging in what Estelle considers 
“coalitional” dynamics, while trying to move 
into being more of a “movement.”

  “The difference between a coalition and 
movement, which is what we’re really trying 
to start, is that a coalition is a cohesive but 
loosely affiliated group that comes together 
for a specific action, like the reclamation of 
CLICS or the March 1 rally, that sort of thing,” 
Estelle said. “It then drifts apart, and then 
comes back together for another action, and 
then drifts apart. A movement is when you are 
able to politicize a large group of people and get 

everyone super involved and have a continuous 
mobilization.”

 Estelle hopes that a more established and 
lasting student movement will effectively begin 
to approach the regents, and even state and 
national legislatures to implement change.

Mireles’ method of influencing regents rath-
er than alienating them, as well as acknowledg-
ing their limited power in the face of state and 
federal budget cuts, is no less critical of the 
UC administration. To Mireles, there exists a 
generational and economic, gap that limits the 
regents’ understanding of the significance of a 
fee hike.

 “I’m not going to say the regents are neces-
sarily evil people, but I am going to say that 
their current life experience as corporate law-
yers and real estate developers are dramatically 
different from almost every student who goes to 
the UC,” Mireles said.

Rather, the regents’ decisions are made based 

on differing perspectives and positions in life. 
“I think the regents cannot fathom what 

it’s like to be an undergraduate on one of 
our campuses,” Mireles said. “To them, rais-
ing tuition another thousand dollars would be 
pocket change, but to many of the students that 
would make or break whether than can go to 
school or not.”

Despite their differing perspectives on how 
exactly to address issues regarding the current 
state of public education, Mireles and Estelle 
both believe in the power of the student rally to 
solve problems that both agree exist.

“Student protesting over the years has 
brought about victory after victory for the 
movement of social justice,” Mireles said. 
“Anybody who tells you otherwise is not being 
truthful.”

“I sort of see art and law as related, both as 
a way of looking at interactions and relation-
ships,” Chang said. “And that’s how I kind of 
see filmmaking, too; it’s sort of a lens into 
human interactions and a way of relating to 
one another.”

With this idea in mind, Chang set out to 
make a fictional short film, “Nanjing Road,” in 
Shanghai, China about a year after graduating 
from law school in 2005. The film opened up a 
pathway to her current documentary, and after 
two years in China, she moved to Dubai with 
the intent to explore the art scene and film a 
documentary. 

“I’d never been in the Mideast before, so 
I totally jumped on it,” Chang said. “We were 
so excited that we were filming on our second 
day there.” But filming in Dubai came with 
its obstacles — first and foremost: the heavy 
censorship. “You need permits to film in 
Dubai, and we ended up just filming secretly,” 
Chang said. “If this film was officially spon-
sored, we wouldn’t have had the liberty to be 
so critical — and not just to be critical of the 
art there but also to be critical of the number 
of workers there and how they’re treated and 
compensated.” Chang can’t count the number 
of times when she and her film crew ran into 
trouble and were chased away or escorted out 
by the Dubai police. “We filmed a lot of things 
we weren’t allowed to,” Chang said. “You’re not 
allowed to film workers, and we filmed a lot of 
workers. So I’m very proud of that — to show 
that that actually exists; there are people who 
are doing these amazing architectural feats.”

Alongside having to sneak around the city, 
the intense heat and sand presented another 
obstacle. “It was about 120 degrees sometimes, 
and there’s just so much sand everywhere, 
blowing sand storms,” Chang said. “And just 

trying to take care of the equipment and mak-
ing sure we could get everything technically 
correct — I would definitely say making a 
film in San Diego was great practice for that. 
Filming at the beach and on the sand — I 
didn’t know it at the time that I would end up 
in Dubai, but I kept referencing back to when 
I would film in La Jolla.” Through the cinéma 
vérité style of the film — letting the story 
unfold organically — Chang hopes to portray 
the rich culture of Dubai and its two layers: 
the excessive and the realistic, focusing on the 
human labor behind the latter. 

Chang also emphasized that it’s a story of 
modern life now. “It’s a universal story about 
the huge dreams that people can have inside 
of a city and then falling short of those dreams 

and the reality behind that and then the value 
of works and workers,” Chang said. “I suppose 
that’s the socialist in me.” 

Using the art scene in Dubai to tap into this 
idea of dreaming, Chang revealed the role of 
Dubai as a platform for art around the world. 

Once filming was complete in 2010, and 
after mailing their tapes out separately to avoid 
running into even more trouble, Chang and 
her team returned to the U.S. to make edits. 
So far, they’ve shown only parts of the docu-
mentary in Ghana, Dubai (cultural edits must 
be made to have it shown in the U.A.E.) and 
Washington D.C.

“We just finished the film, so we’re showing 
it around and trying to get it into American 
International Festivals,” Chang said. “We really 

want to bring it to a bigger audience.”
While still waiting for the proper premiere 

of “Glitter Dust,” Chang is currently back in 
D.C. in pre-production of her upcoming film 
on Chinese labor camps.

She wants to return to Dubai in time for 
the Dubai Film Festival and hopes to be able to 
show her documentary there.

“I want to continue making films and con-
tinue making art and share it with as many 
people as possible,” Chang said. “There are so 
many stories to be told. It’s just so interesting. 
I can’t believe this is the first documentary I’ve 
made.”

from 40 feet out. The ball dropped 
to give the Golden Eagles the win 
with 0.1 seconds left on the clock.

“That’s something I practice 
every day after practice,” Hammer 
said. “After practice I stay in there 
just throwing up shots just hoping 
that one day if I get the chance it 
will go in. The funny thing is that 
when I went in, I told my teammate 
[Ramon], that if I get the shot I told 
her it’s going in.”

Cal State Los Angeles advanced 
to the CCAA Championship title 
game the following day, but fell to 
Cal State Monterey Bay 79-61.

Despite the loss, the Tritons 

remain with only two losses on the 
season and have already clinched 
a place in the NCAA Division II 
tournament. 

But without a conference 
title, UCSD may have lost the 
opportunity to host the first round 
of the West Regionals. 

“I think at times things have 
come too easy for us, and that’s 
unfortunate,” Elliott said. “The 
good news is we get to play again, 
and we’re just going to start over. It 
would have been amazing to win 
a conference tournament in our 
building. But it wasn’t meant to be. 
That kid hit a crazy shot. It wasn’t 
meant to be.”

The Tritons return to the court 
this Friday, March 9 at 7:30 pm, 
when they will host the first round 
of the NCAA Division II National 
Tournament. 

It was announced on Sunday, 
March 4 that UCSD qualified for 
the 64-team tournament along 
with CCAA members Cal Poly 
Pomona, CSU Los Angeles and 
CCAA Champions CSU Monterey 
Bay.

“We don’t get another do over, 
the next loss ends it all,” Elliott 
said.

“I was just looking for a 55 

(second time), like come on, just 
run your race and win, just make it. 
Then I came around the last corner 
and I saw the clock sitting at the 
finish line, and I was like, I could 
take this, I could get the 54.”

Rose finished first, setting a 
new meet record of 54.9 seconds, 
besting Ericka Nowell of UC Irvine 
by nearly two seconds. 

This mark improves her NCAA 
provisional mark and puts her 
just a tenth of a second off the 
automatic qualifying time.

“It was a solid performance 
against some good Division I 
teams,” women’s head coach Darcy 
Ahner said. “The highlight today 
was in the women’s 400m watching 
Jackie Rose find another level and 
race with confidence.”

In the women’s 4x400m relay, 
sophomore Lauren Irish started 

well, but on the exchange to junior 
Lorato Anderson, the Tritons had 
fallen to second place. 

Anderson lost another place on 
the way around, and handed the 
baton off to Rose in third trailing 
by 15 meters. 

Rose took the baton and ran 
down UCSB senior Amanda 
Rodriguez and senior Kelly Collins 
of UCI in the last 100m of the lap, 
managing a 53.6 second split, the 
fastest since Christine Merill split a 
53 two years ago. 

Merill is now running for the 
Sri Lankan National Team and will 
be in the 2012 London Olympic 
games.

Roberson was caught on the 
back stretch by Nowell and Jessica 
Johnson of Santa Barbara. 

Coming off the last turn, 
Roberson put her head down and 
caught back up to Nowell, leaning 
past her to take second place with 
an overall time of 3:49.02.

Roberson also won the 400m 
hurdles with a time of 1:03.82. The 
time is only .82 off of a NCAA 
provisional mark.

Other standouts in the meet 
included red-shirt junior Ryan 
Eckert, who threw a personal best 
51’4.5” to take third in the shot put, 
and red-shirt senior Erin Langford, 
who jumped 18’2.5” to take second 
in long jump. 

Sophomore Kellen Levy also 
stood out in the 3000m run, leading 
for much of the race and kicking 
with 600m left to take second at 
8:31 seconds. 

The men have not finished 
this high at the All-Cal meet since 
1999, the first year the meet was 
held. The strong performances 
from both squads display the depth 
the Tritons have going into the 
heart of their season.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL—After falling 
to No. 12 University of the Pacific 
on Saturday, March 3 and No. 2 
Stanford the day before, the UCSD 
Men’s Volleyball team has gone 
without a win for its eighth straight 
game.

Playing on the road, the Tritons 
managed to take one set from 
the Cardinal 25-22, but were 
overpowered offensively by 13-4 
overall Stanford. The Tritons 
dropped the other three sets 21-25, 
15-25 and 19-25.

UCSD managed to outblock the 
Cardinal 10 to 7.5, but fell on the 
offensive end.

Sophomore outside hitter Carl 
Eberts and Johl Awerkamp led the 
Tritons in scoring, both finishing 
with 14 kills apiece on five errors. 
Stanford’s Brad Lawson was 
outstanding on the night, leading 
all players with 18 kills on just four 
errors, for an attack percentage of 
0.452. 

On Saturday, UCSD was swept 

by No. 12 University of the Pacific 
— ninth in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation — for the second 
time this season. 

Awerkamp led in scoring for the 
Tritons again with 10 kills on four 
assists. But Pacific’s Taylor Hughes 
led all players with 17 kills on just 
three errors. 

The second set was close, as 
the Tritons pushed the match into 
overtime, but fell to Pacific 27-25. 
But UCSD was blown out in the 
first and third sets, falling 25-17 
and 25-16.

The Tritons now fall to 1-11 
in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, where they compete as 
the only Division II team. UCSD 
is ranked last in the 12-team 
conference. The Tritons will 
continue their road trip with four 
more away games.

UCSD will face No. 1 nationally 
ranked UCLA this Thursday, March 
8, followed by a game against UC 
Santa Barbara on Friday, March 9.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, MARCH 5,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

It’s in postseason play when collegiate athletes stop thinking about games in terms of wins or 
losses or records, and start talking 
about ‘ending seasons’ or playing 
another night.

Having already secured a spot 
in the NCAA Division II National 
Tournament, the No. 1 UCSD 
Women’s Basketball team fell last 
Friday, March 1 against a Cal State 
Los Angeles squad that found itself 
in a win or go home situation, and 
who was ultimately better on the 
night.

“[Cal State Los Angeles is] 
fighting for its season and we didn’t 
match them,” senior guard Chelsea 
Carlisle said. “They did the little 
things that they needed to, and they 
had a little extra something and I 
don’t think we had that tonight.”

In the second leg of the CCAA 
Conference tournament, the 
Tritons, having squandered an 
eight-point lead early in the second 
half, found themselves in their 
closest match of the season. Fatigue 
figured on both benches, forcing 
UCSD head coach Charity Elliott 
to pull from her reserves as neither 
team conceded to dropping tempo.

No one has questioned the 
strength of UCSD’s starting five 
— four of whom were named to 
the All-CCAA First Team — but it 
was the periods of time when All-
CCAA selections Carlisle, senior 
guard Daisy Feder and junior guard 
Emily Osga weren’t on the court 
that the Golden Eagles were able to 
cut the Triton lead.

Up 42-34, Cal State Los Angeles 
guard Tessondra Williams and 6’0” 
power forward Lacy Ramon teamed 
to cut the lead to one-point just four 
minutes into the second half. 

The rest of the game was a battle 
for the Tritons to find a way to 
stop Williams and Ramon — whose 
ability to alternatively post up or 
score off the dribble put her at 
an advantage over UCSD’s shorter 
guard Megan Perry and slower 
senior forward Lauren Freidenberg. 

The Golden Eagles shot out to a 
seven-point lead after Ramon drove 
to the bucket and turned around to 
pick off the Triton inbound pass for 
a quick field goal. 

Surprisingly, Elliott elected to 
field Perry in place of Freidenberg, 
still down with just three minutes 
left to play. But the Tritons went on 

a 7-1 run to take a narrow 71-69 
lead. Osga drove to the basket to 
put UCSD up by four points before 
Cal State Los Angeles head coach 
Janell Jones called a time out. 

The Golden Eagles put together 
five points before Osga took back 
the lead with a big layup.

Up 75-74, Cal State Los Angeles 
failed to convert on four consecutive 
rebounds, ending the possession 
with UCSD inbounding from the 
Golden Eagle baseline. 

Elliott drew up a risky 
but ultimately effective play, 
with sophomore forward Erin 
Dautremont lobbing the ball down 
court to Osga, who ate up the clock 
before she was fouled and sent to 
the line. Osga missed the first, but 
sunk her second attempt with 3.8 
seconds left on the clock.

Jones called another timeout to 
put senior guard Lorin Hammer 
on the court, who only played five 
minutes on the night. 

The Golden Eagles ran the 
baseline, finding Hammer up 
towards the half court line. Hammer 
put the ball down on the court twice 
before she chanced a three-pointer

TRACK & FIELD — The UCSD 
Track & Field team came out big on 
Saturday in the All-Cal Invitational. 
The Tritons posted a third place 
finish for the women and a second 
place finish for the men, who 
squeaked into second place by only 
three points on the very last event 
of the day.

UCSD did well amongst Division 
I opponents — UC Irvine, UC Santa 
Barbara and UC Riverside is more 
remarkable as the men’s side saw 
only one event winner. 

Senior team captain Nick Howe 
won the javelin throw with a toss 
of 201’8”, besting long-time rival 
Michael Guerrero of UCSB by over 
eight feet. 

The UCSD men did not win any 
other events at the Invitational, but 
they were just deeper than the other 

teams to capture second. UCSD 
had enough second and third place 
finishers to punch them ahead of 
most of their Division I rivals.

“We really competed well against 
our sister schools today,” said UCSD 
head Coach Tony Salerno. “The 
men’s second place team finish was 
a real surprise. We managed to pull 
it off with only one event winner out 
of 19 events on the men’s side. That’s 
a pretty remarkable accomplishment 
at this level.”

The men’s team was behind by 
three until the last event of the day, 
the discus throw. Junior Zachary 
Nagengast busted out a 159’1” 
throw to take third despite tough 
wind conditions. 

Senior Dane Sandifer came in to 
take three points for sixth place to 
put the Tritons ahead of UC Irvine 
with a throw of 150’2.5”. 

This is a remarkable feat as 
the Anteaters have the NCAA 

Champion in the 800 meters and 
World Championship finalist, 
Charles Jock, who ran far ahead of 
the field in long sprints. Jock ran 
the 1500 in 3:53.44, a good time for 
such an early season outing.

On the women’s side, senior 
sprints captain Jacqueline Rose 
again led the Triton squad. 

In the 4 x 100 meter relay, 
alongside freshman Laura 
Schellenberg, freshman Jessica 
Beerman, junior Kathleen Hitchens 
and Rose, the Tritons came in a 
close third. 

Rose then took second at the 
200m dash, missing a first place 
finish by less than a tenth of a 
second at 24.91. This mark moves 
her from tenth all time to eighth all 
time for UCSD. In her specialized 
event, the 400m dash, Rose was 
looking for a marginal time after 
recording a personal record last
