Police committee 
Dlay ignore scuffle 

AS insists issue be examined 
BY JEFF 

BERESFORD-HOWE 
New!! Editor 

The committee for.med to 
investigate and recommend 
new procedures to govern 

.police·student relations may 
be torpedoed before it get a 
chance to work. 

As created by the 
administration. the commit-
tee would ignore police 
activity at last November' 
reception for Chancellor 
Atkinson. during which 
police forcibly removed 
peaceful demonst rators from 
outside the Mandeville 
Annex. 

All appointments to the 
c ommittee have been 
completed. so nothing except 
coordinating sched\Jles 
stand in the way of a 
meeting. 

Beside Topkis and 
Williams, both AS officials, 
Revelle Dean Ernie Mort has 
been .selected as the student 
affair representative, Anton 
Witte will attend from the 
administration, the faculty 
chairwoman will be Joyce 
jusgus, and police represen· 
tat ives are Sgt. Steve Branen 
and officer BobJones. 

Can you find your car? Parking is at a premium in one of the Muir lots. This scene is from a 
typical morning or afternoon in the life of a UCSD driver. Students sometimes circle through 
the nume.rous UCSD lots several times before they can find a legal parking place for their 
vehicle. All the while, UCSD's Parking Enforcement officers make the same circuit, searching 
for parking rule infractions. 

The committee would 
simply discuss new ways 
students and police can 
interact with less likelihood 
of conflict. 

The AS, however. is 
insisting that the committee 
confront the issue of police 
behaviur al the November 
picket line. 

Topkis and chancellor's 
office representatives Pat 
Collum have promised that 
the meetings will be open to 
the public, regardless of their 
subject matter. . 

The impetus for the 
committee came from the 
police action at the 
chancellor's reception. US, Mexican 

agriculture 
are examined 

The UCSD Pt:Ogram in 
United States :Mexican 
Studies will hold a major 
binational consultation on 
US - Mexican agricultural 
relations, Thursday and 
Friday, Feb. 26·27. 

The consultation will be 
the first attempt to 
systematically examine the 
major changes occurring in 
the agricultural sector on 
both sides of the US-Mexico 
border, and to view th m a. 
interrela~ed processes. 

The conference, to be held 
at the Travelodge Tower at 
Harbor Is land in San Diego, 
will also deal with links 
between US and Mexican 
agriculture that empha ize 
trade and labor flow , 
especially in the period since 
the end of the "bracero 
program" in 1964.

The AS resolution 
reflecting that insi tence 
require student committee 
members Reggie William 
and Bill Topkis to leave the 
committee if the AS request 
is not upheld . 

Topki aid yesterday. 
however, that there i a way 
police conduct might not be 
inve tigated that would 
allow th tudents on the 
committee to continue their 
participation. 

"It really depends on their 
attitude. If there's a full 
recognition. or admi s ion of 
guilt on the part ·of the polic 
department. that's what 
we're looking for. " Topki ~ 
·aid. 

" But I think tha t 
accompanyi ng that (admls,

In estigat ion ," he add d. 

No dat has been set for the 
committee's first meet ing.

chancel lor ' ~ offic had said 
would be las t qu ar ter. T opkis 
expect s one soon. though. 
a nd says Atkin so n has 
promised him he wi ll attend 
the firs t meeting. 

The AS, angry that they 
had not had what they 
considered a ubstantive 
enough voice in the way 
Chancellor Atklnson was 
chosen, decided to picket a 
community and faculty 
reception for him in 
Mand ville Annex , which is 
acro 's the hall from the 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

About 25 protestor 
marched in a circle, 
occa.· ionally chant ing and 
carrying picket s igns. 

At an order from a till 
unidentified administrator 
in s ide the annex, police 
formed a line and removed 
the demonstrators. picking 
some up b the neck and

Whose 'world of one people?' 
Editor: 

If the anonymous writer of 
the letter Guardian, Jan .. 22 
concerning Third World 
students has to remind 
himself that these "students 
are people," then it's 
unders tandable why this 
perl'lon chose to keep his or 
her name a secret. 

A Third World stud~t 
does nut have to be reminded 
that the key success at the 
university level is personal 
ability and perserverance. 
The Guardian's front page 
articllf (Jan . 22) on the 
Vietnamese refu~ student 
taking 38 units in a SIngle 
quarter is a case. in point. 

We do not want to be 
thought of as mere statistics, 
but we do want those 
statistics. We need them to 
show to others, like banners 
proclaimng out awareness of 
the unfortunate socia l 
circu'mstances in the..United 
States that have prevented, 
and continue to prevent, the 
incorporation of non·white 
tudents into the ocial 

mainstream. 
Pass ing or failing classes is 

based on each stud en t's 
merit, but so what?! How on 
earth rs this relevant to the 
importance of maintaining 
and improving minority 
recruitment programs? 
Success for Third World 
st udents will not come if they 
are not given the opport unit y 
to be successful. Why should 
minority youth even try to 
increase their own merit if 
they find themselvC!l in such 
unnuturing iltlUospheres as 
ghellos, barrios and ·non· 
st imulat ing junior colleges? 

If the anonymous writer 
believes the flag that 
minority stUdents use to rillly 
behind is phony, then he or 
she sl}ould not have anyl hing 
to fear aoout tlJe unity it 

might ;.. trin~. But the flag has 
the PQtentlal of not being 
phonY-I for it is-rnadeup()f the 
cor.HdutY.discriminatory · 
experienCes. all · .,on-white 
people have had alKI continue 
to have. · ... 

. 

The reference Ihe annny-
mou~ writer made to a 
"world of one people" i~ 
hypocritical. The white 
people came and inst iIled 
upon us their segre~atJonal 
labels: Nigger. Spic. Kike and 
Gook. Then 'we tried to 
di~nj(y Ilur unfortunate 

circum ·tances by changing 
out label ' to our chosen 
names whether it be Black , 
Chicano, Jew or Asian. 

Thi s is not re verse 
di s rimination - it i ' not 
even reverse anything. It is 
an effort to reach more 
equitable circumstances. 
Whether certain people like it 
or not, further efforts toward 
equitable circumstances will 
be made. 

It i not racist to demand 
administrative change for a 
better affirmative act ion 

program. What was. and IS 
racist. is that which allowed 
the inequitable circumstan-
ces between whit e and non · 
white people of thi s nation to 
occur and continue to occur. 
All s tudents should avoid 
racism. for the world itself 
implies narrowl1l imledne. s, 
which has no place in modern 
education .

No_parking patience 
Editor: 

Six-thirty am. The familiar 
but unpleasant blare of your 
clock radio wakes you from a 
blissful sleep, You groggily go 
through the morning routine: 
shower, shave, Pop Tarts. 
You don't even have enough 
time to warm up your car. It 
may decrease the perfor· 
mance of your new K-car, but 
if it get · you out of the house 
fi ve minute earlier-, it's 
worth it! 

Going on a trip? Vi iting a 
girlfriend? tarting a job 
with the Reagan transition 
team? Hell no! You're merely 
ru shing to UCSD to find a 
... parking space! 

Sound familiar? Are rou 
tired of arriving at schoo 15 
minutes before class but 
taking your seat 10 minutes 
late? Tired of playing chicken 
with three other cars 
scrambling for. that lone 
parking space behind HL? 
Feel tipped off by having to 
pay $45 per year for a permit 

. and then being forced to 
continually shell out money 
for the metered spaces? 

The parking situation at 
UCSD is a very real and very 
frustrating problem .. Anyone 
who owns an "S" Permit 
must surely, at one time or 
~hOther, have felt the anger 

- that we have felt. and must 
now feel it is time for a 
chan~. 

With 15 percent more 
permits issued yearly I han 

. spaces available, it is no 
wonder t hat chaos .results. 

-The disproporlionate 
number of spaces to permits 
seems e,,'en more astounding 
wh n one considers that 
many of the parking spaces 
are located behind the 

Warren apartments. a good 
W-to·IS·minute walk from 
the Revelle quad . 

So what can be done? One 
suggestion would be to 
convert some of the "B" 
spaces into the more highly 
demanded "S" spaces. Is it 
fair that someone owning a 
"B" permit should be gi ven 
preferential treatment wit h 
parking and alway s be 
guaranteed a spac ? UC Dis 

," not a caste system and should 
not act as one. 

Another alternat ive would 
be to redesign the l>arking 
slots so t hat they are angled 
rather than perpendicular to 
the parking aisle. This would 
allow for maximum us('of the 
limited Sllace available. Sure. 
such a project WClU Id cost a 
small fee, but t hat is just a 
drop in the bucket when<>ne 
considers that the university. 
receives half of the revenue 
from the 30,000 tickets issued 
annually! 

These are only sugges-
tions, and to say thal one of 
{hem is the magic anllwer to 
the parkin~ ' problem .. would 
be simplistic and egotistical. 
All we are asking i~ that the 
problem be diS(.'usSfd and 
t ha t some so I u t ion be 
reached . The schoba can 
ignore the l>n)blem aric1 hopt' 
theattrilion raledoe:H~jl)b 
for ,it, M th4sludent l"ouncil 
can (ake malters into~s own 
hands . 

There is so much .nnre I'd 
like tl) sav but I'm reall,'

think my meter is about to

tephe n Cox. director of the 
HUl11anit ies Sequ n ee writ ing 
program at Revelle College. says the 
goal of the course is to enlwine a 

~u bstantial knowledge of Western 
culture and tradition with effective 
writing skills_ Of t he fi ve hours spend 
in class each week. three hours are 
devoted strictly to lect ures about a 
certain aspect of Western cu lture on 
which the paper topics are based . 

One might que tion if the existing 
el-up inclu des enough writing 

instruct ion. Margaret C lowry , a 
Revelle student, feels mos! of the help 
she received was due to her personal 
effort. 

"TA's were always avai lable and 
wi ll ing to help me with my papers," 
she said. " If someone were really 
interested on improving their wri ting, 
they could - if just took a lot of effort 
and t ime." 

David Ri tchie, a TA for the program 
echoed this sentiment. "Students 

esspnt iall\' I cach t hClllst:h t:S. Tho:-,e 
who pllt a-Illt into it. get a lot oul of it." 

Like mosl of the Reve ll e 
curriculum. th"e \\'riling program is 
ven- Slrlict ur d. While Muir st udenl s 
can- choose their o\\' n paper topics. 
H umanit ies s l udents must eit her 
write one ancient or modern Western 
culture. David Luft , chairman of Ihe 
H um anit ies writ ing program, f cIs 
t hi s is a favorable charaClerist ic. 

" It' s a wonderful and special 
experience which is exclusi ely 
Revelle. It establishes an old school 
seriousness about the humanities," 
he said. 

One Revelle sophomore sees the 
H umanit ies program as a good one for 
the mat h or science st udent. " It 's an 
excellent opport unity for a person to 
learn valuable philosophical theor ie~. 
If it weren' l requ ired, I probably 
wou ld have taken anot her class." 

Not everyone shares this opinion_ 
Some tudents fi nd the subject matter 
"too intense for freshmen ." An of ten-
heard complaint is that a s tudent just 
graduated from high school does not 
have the writingskills to deal wi th the

"makes studen ts aware of,what high

rccogni z s t his -problem. He feels the 
educat ional Syst em as a w hole now 
expect siess -from 5t udents_ T heir 
writ ing abilit~ and knowledge of

"St udents are smarter but know 
less," he says. 

In add it ion to su bject matter, 
grading policy poses I he biggest 
problem for bot h writ ing programs_ 
Many fres hmen who performed well 
in high school -English classes are 
shocked when their papers receive Bs 
and Cs. " It 's very humiliating for 
student s who think they can write," 
says Dr. Luft. 

While grading and discussing 
papers wit h students , Cox is careful 
not to destroy the confidence of the 
st udent. In fact. Rit chie says that 
because the s t udent is under a lot of 
stress, t he first two quarters of the

. 

W rit~ng progratns 
continued from pa.e 5 
option at Revelle, and Cox believes the 
PINP policy is too lax for the program 
and would hurt students' motivation 
to perform well if offered. 

The TAs and, the and the directors 
of the Humanities Sequence say there 
is "surprising uniformity" in the 
Vades handed out. Each paper is read 
by the student's TA, a second TAand 
in most cases by Cox or his assistant 
George Hanson. 

In contrast to the Muir writing 
program, the Humanities Sequence 
has not experienced any major 
overhauls since its beginnings . in 
1915. Most instructors in the program 
say there is little evidence a change is 
needed. . 

"1 wouldn't change any thin$.' What 
we're doing is correct," saysGIIJones, 
• Humanities TA. 

Instructors must be doing 
IOmething riflht, because according to 
Luft, Cox, Ritchie and Jones, there is 
ereat improvement in students' 
writing skills in almost all cases. Bui 
many students are skeptical. One 

Revelle junior summed up the 
sentiment best : . 

," If ther decreased either the 
amount 0 reading or writing, the 
quality of papers Oi th attention 
payed to the readin~ would increase:" 

Conversely, readmg plays a much 
smaller role in the Muir curriculum. 
Instead, the primary emphasis is 
placed upon critical thinking, clarity 
and a disciplined writing process 
which encourages paper revisions. 

Furthermore, Muir is more varied 
in its course topics than Revelle, 
"TA's introduce students to their own 
philosophies on su bjects such as art 
and music. That's different from any 
other college:' says Holland. 

And just as Dr. Luft categorized his 
program as "exclusively Revelle:' 
Holland believes his program has a 
distinct "Muir·like flavor." 

Along with that "flavor" follows the 
difference in,the two grading systems. 
Muir does offer the PINP option. In 
fact, up until 1978·1979, it .was the 
rule. But according to Holland, 
students were giving the class low 

priority. 
But Jim Anderson, a TA for the 

Muir program, tries to encourage his 
students to continue to take the class 
PINP. "The thing that stands in the 
way of learning is that tudents are 
preoccupied with grades rather than 
what they can take and learn from the 
program." he said . 

Recent graduate: of the program 
were interested in grades and many 
comments revolved around them . 
Robin Stambaugh. a Muir sophomore, 
felt that because t he individual papers 
were not graded, she was never aware 
of her status in the class. ") had no 
idea} wasn 't doing A work until the 
end. 

Another Muir student complained 
of the lack of uniformity among TA's 
and the grades they gave. "They boast 
about their uniform grading system, 
but even as a student, I saw a lot of 
disparities. " 

Both Holland and Anderson 
disagree. "Although there is a big 
difference in the way TA's operate, 
the grading is very consistent," says 
Anderson. As with the Revelle 
program, all papers thought to be 
borderline, as well as those up for "A" 
consideration, are read by the 
students own T A as well as by a panel 

of other TA's. 
Along with grading and the possible 

loss of undergraduate tutors, the high 
student/ TA ratio was also cited as a 
problem at Muir. According to 
Holland , " small seminar sty le 
lecture ' are very enjoyable and very 
productive." But. the ratio. now 17 to 
one. is con idered too large. 
, Anot her problem often voiced by 
student is the lack of constructi ve 
criticism given to overall writing 
style. "Tutors would pick out little 
things in my papers instead of helping 
with overall style," one sophomore 
commented. ' 

In contrast to the Revelle program 
Muir has undergone some major 
changes in the last few years. Muir 10, 
the first of the two part writing 
sequence, was changed this year by 
the program's new director, Barbara 
Tomlinson. Those chagnes involved 
the volume and diverseness of the 
writing exercises, explained Holland. 

Of the two programs, only the 
Humanities sequence was listed in the 
Course and Professor Evaluation 
(CAPE) report. On the whole, most 
students thought the lecture courses 
were well taught, and the course 
material was interesting.

archives in East Berlin. 
"I was engaged in a race 

against the clock," Lyon said. 
"Many of the people I 
interviewed were Brecht's 
contemporaries. I was able to 
speak with Brecht's widow 
nine months before she died. 
Nearly half the people I spoke 
with are no longer alive, 

During Hitler's reign in 
Germany, scores of intellec' 
tual and cultural leaders 
flocked to the United States 
to escape the oppression and 
persecution ot the Nazi 
regime. 

Al1lOng those emigres was 
the writer Bertolt Brecht, a 
man called "the strongest, 
most influential theater man 
of our time" by aitic Peter 
Brook. 

Brecht, cOllsidered by 
many to be the greatest 

dramatist of the 20th 
century, lived in Santa 
Monica froni 1941 to 1947. 
During that period of time, he 
wrote plays, poetry and 
Hollyw'ood scripts; he was 
politically and socially act ive, 
and he was the object of a 
long·running surveillance 
conducted by the Federal 
Bureau of Investi~ation. 

Brecht's years m America

book by James K. Lyon, 
professor and chairman of

California, San Diego. Lyon's In order to cut through the 
book, Bertoll Brecht in gossip and hearsay that has

Bills go 
before 
Assembly 
continued from page 1 
out with each other during 
particularly pa s sionate 
debates. 

Mo s t bill s directly 
affecting students or the 
University of California will 
be con s idered in the 
Assembly by the subcommit· 
tee on post s econdar y 
education, chaired by Teresa 
Hughes, D-Los Angeles, and 
in the fiscal su bcommittee on 
education, chaired by Gary 
Hart, D·Santa Barbara. . 

In tile Senate, the key_ 
bodies are the educational 
policy committee, chaired .by 
Alan Sieroty , D-Los Angeles 
and the fiscal education 
committee, headed by Walt 
Stiern, D-Bakersfield . . 

This year should prove 
more interesting than most, 
since new Assembly speaker 
Willie Brown - who presides 
over a Democratic majority 
- has assigned a Republican 
vice chairman to nearly all 
the Assembly committees 
after courting Republican 
support last month in his 
speakership fight . 

Some of the more 
intriguing bills introduced so 
far in the legislalure 
incll1de~: 

Testing 
San Francisco's Sen. 

Milton Marks has submitted 
a bill that would allow 
students taking standardized 
tests s'uch as SATs, MCATs 
and others the right to 
request copies of their exam 
along wi th correct answers. 

Tickets 
Ticket scalping at concerts 

would become prohibited 
under similar 'bills intro-
duced by two assembly 
members, Mel Levine, D·LOS' 
Angeles, and Bruce Young, D-
Norwalk. The bills are partly 
in response to complaints 
about the debacle surround-
ing the Bruce Springsteen 
concert last fall in Los 
Angeles, when blocks of 
tickets were scalped for up to 
$200 each. 

Mono Lake 
Sen. John Garamendi, D· 

Stockton, wants to make 
threatened Mono Lake a state 
part to prevent it from 
further draining. 

Gays 
Job d-iscriminations 

against · gays would be 
outlawed under A'S I, 
submitted by San Francisco's 
Art Agnos. This is expected 
.to be one of t he more 
controversial measures 
considered this year. 

Toxic wastes 
Assemblyman Young has 

intro<luced a bill making it a 
lelohY to willfully dispose of 
hazardous wastes at an 
unauthorized dump site. A 
second measure, by Marily 
Ryan, R-Redondo Beach, 
would encourage finding 
alternatives to present 
landfill storage and sewer 
discharges of toxic wastes. 

Bottles 
For the third year in a row, 

Sen. Omer Rains, D-Santa 
Barbara, has submitted his 
"bottle bill." that would ' 
require , a deposit to ' be 
charged for all beer and soft 
drink containers. The bill • 
stoutly opposed by bottlers 
and brewers, has been killed 
in the Natural Resources and 
Wildlife committee both

Swimmers stun SD State, 53-50

"Absolutely awesome!" 

were the word's of swim 
coach Bill Morgan after the 
men's swi m team upset 
cross,town rival San Diego 
State. "It took four long 
years, but we finally beat 
them." The final score was 
53,50. and the meet was every 
bit as close as the score 
indictes. The women's team 
lost to state 79·48 in an 
excellent meet. 

The meet was not without 
its controversial moments. 
UCSD was trailing in team 
points going into the 
breastroke and desperately 
needed a first and second 
place in this event. The 
Tritons got their wish as 
both Dave Reed and Steve 
Best finished ahead of an 
SDSU swimmer with times 

of 2:17.2 and 2:19 . 6 
respect ively. 

However. a moment of 
tension arose when Best 
jumped over several lane ' to 
congratulate Reed and wa' 
sub equently disqualified for 
his action. An argument 
ensued between both coaches 
and the official, and the 
matter was left up in the air, 
until after the meet. 

Despite the official's cal l, 
UCSD was determined to 
finish the meet on a high note 
and they did just that with a 
strong win in the 400 free 
relay. Hernandez, Doyas, 
Doug Lee and John Beckley 
.clocked a 3:16.3 as they 
qualified another UCSD ' 
relay for nationals. To 
highltght the evening, the 
offic;ial changed hi ruling on

team has realy come of age." 
said Coach Morgan . "E\'ery-
one \ as really pulling for

was awesome." 

The men's 400 medley 
relay of Tracy Strahl. Steve 
Best. Dave Reed and Joe 
Hernandez set the mood for 
the entire m~t as they 
touched·out the SDSU relay 
team with a time of 3:40.2. 
The roar of the crowd wa 
deafen i ng as Hernandez 
fini shed the freestyle leg with 
a school record and another 
broken nationals time 
standard. 

Freshman Greg Doyas 
followed suit as he gualified 
for the 200 free. fmishi ng 
within inches of the SDSU 
leader in a time of 1 :46.5. 
Lance Hal ted also decided to 
jump on the nationals ' 

bandwagon wi th a strong 
performance in the 1650 free . 
Despite a recent sickn ss. 
Halsted was clocked at 
16:50.4.

diver Derek Douglas taking 
second place. Dougla ·. who 
wa not entirely pleased with 
hi ' performance, nevert he· 
less picked up an important 
three points for his efforts. 

After the first events. the 
competi tive fever spread like 
a brushfire among the UCSD 
swimmer . The next to fall 
prey was Bob ConJin who 

clearly dominated the 500 
free with a 4:52.8. Rich 
Peter on wa not far behind 
Conlin a: he 'wam a 4:56.0 in 
the 'ame event. 

Dave Reed picked up a win 
in the 200 individual medley 
with a 2:02.6 and also placed 
first in the controversial 200 
breast event. 

The women' races were 
overshadowed by fierce 
competition in the men's 
divis ion. but their swims 
were equally strong. The top 
UCSD women's swimmer 
was Jackie van Egmond with 
wins in the 100 1M (1:05.7), 
200 1M (2:21.3) and a 25.9-

Atomic Cafe concert offers new music 

BY SID CORBETT 
The considerable success 

of the graduate student 
composers. and the formi-
dable reputations of the 
faculty have afforded UCSD 
international acclaim as a 
leading tenter of American 
contemporary music. 

Through the department's 
excellent forum, Atpmicafe. 
composers. performers and 
interested listeners are given 

- an opportunity to ex'plore 
alternatives in musical 
expression. These perfor-

• mances offer t he challen~ of 
applying one's prevIous 
musical experience to a very 
different sound world. Yet 
while highly praised and 
supported by both the local 
and international music 
community. the performan-
Ces receive little attention 
from a student body that 
prides itself on its awareness 
of the experimental and the 
JII"OII"essive. 

On Wednesday evening, 

Prqgram, faculty afford UCSD international acclaim 
Mandeville Auditorium 
(previously hallowed by uch 
diver e musical talents as 
lohn Cage. Anthony Braxton, 
and Count Basie, among 
others) was graced by a 
superb performance of new 
music presented by the 
Atomicafe. The Atomicafe is 
a (student) organization 
dedicated to the presentation 
of contemporary music, 
particularly the music of 
UCSD graduate composers. 

The program opened with 
Gerald Gabel's "SONGS 
AND EPITAPHS OF THE 
GOLDEN SUN," an ensem-
ble piece for soprano (Alicia 
Bruchez), flute (Nancy 
Turetzky). harp(Nancy Kay), 
celestel"Cecil Lytle) and two 
percussionists aoel Blue-
stone and Daryl Pratt) 
conducted by the composer. 
The piece was characterized 
by an extremely lyrical and 
expressive melodic style. 
complimented by the 
exceptional talents of the 

performers - in particular. 
the beautiful oprano work of 
undergraduate Alicia 
Bruchez - and by an 
extremely su btle and delicate 
t eatment of harmony, 
dynamic and timbre. 
Although at times a bit 
academic and somewhat 

inaccessible, the piece as a 
whole exhibited the richness 
of spirit and transcendent 
musIcality which seems to 
characterize the works that 
endure. 

Gerald Gabel is a doctoral 
candidate at UCSD. He 
currently directs both the La 
lolla Civic/University 
Chorus and the UCSD 
Concert Choir. 

Gabel's work was followed 
by an electronic p'iece for 
four-channel tape, . Nekyia," 
composed by Gareth Loy. 
Garet h Loy. manager of the 

In terested in a 

Computer Audio Re earch 
Laboratory at the CME. is a 
very distinguis hed electronic 
music composer who earned 
his reputation as a doctoral 

.recipient at Stanford 
University for his work in the 
field of computer music. The 
recent acquisition by UCSD 

of a highly sophisticated 
mus ic computer certainly 
figured in his decision to 
work at UCSD. 

Unlike manx electronic 
pieces. "Nekyia . was neither 
overly long nor technical to 
the point of alienation from 
audience involvement. 
Rather, the use of long, 
imploring tones (reminiscent 

' of a perfectly tuned string 
orchestra) and. again. very 
delicate and highly complex 
abstract sounds - amplified 
by the technique of shooting 
the sound around the rpom

ith the aid uf four 'peakers 
located in different section 
of the hall - gave a ublime 
and powerful et herea! 
feeling. 

The first half of the 
program concluded with 
anot her ensem ble piece. 
"Passage Ways." by David 
Felder. The piece is scored for 
flute (Margo Simmons). 
trombone .(Tom McColley). 
'cello (Mark Cupovic ). 
percussion aoel Bluestone), 
piano aohn McKay) and 
electronic piano (George 
Arasimoicz). It was conduc-
ted by UCSD graduate 
student Steed Cowart. 
Felder. a member of the 
undergraduate music 
technology faculty. wrote 
perhaps t he most accessible 
music of the evening. 
Through very careful use of 
tonality, the listener is given 
something familiar harmoni-
cally which he can cling to. 
Yet this familiarity is only by 
inference. and is abruptly 
taken from us just when our 
listening habits lead us to 
expect the familiar tonic 
cadence. Admittedly, the 
musicality eScaped me at 
times, especially during the 
more active. virtuostic 
passages. but some of this 
must he attributed to the 
newness of the sound and the 
uniqueness of each contem-
porary piece which makes a 
fair and valid interpretation 
of new music literally 
impossible upon the listener. 
There is simply too much 
adaptation and learning the 
ear must do to allow the 
listener to even approach 
comprehension without 
several listenings. 

Intermission followed the 
Felder piece. and due to a 
prior committment. I was 
unable to hear the second half 
of the program. However, the 
two pieces that rounded out 
the evening. had both been 
performed previously at 
UCSD. The first. "Okir," 
was composed by a visiting 
faculty member from the 

-' University of the Phillipines, 
Mr. Bayani de Leon. Mr. De 
Leon is currently completing 
his graduate stud~ under 
Professor Robert Erickson 
and Roger Reynolds. The 
piece is scored for flute, harp 
and contr.abass (Bert 
Turetzky), and was conduc-
ted by Gerald Gabel. The 
program finished with "3 for 
5." for percussion (Daryl -
Prat t) and tape, by a 
composer who has earned a 
growing reputation in new 
music composition -
Richard Zvonar. The piece 
was very well received at its 
premiere last year. and 
earned a mention at the 
Electroacoustic Music 
Awards a~ Bourges. France.

doing so, would turn up

Lyon says he feels his book 
is valuable not only as a 
chronicle of Brecht's 
American experience. but as 
a look at the profound impact

[nternal AID documents

"Land to the T iller" are not

has written of the "signifi·

At issue afterward was 
both the force with which 
police moved and the lack of 
warning before acting to 
clear the area. 

No witne ss e s could 
remem her any police order or 
request to disperse, and 
several P9licemen questioned 
at the scene said that the 
officer in charge was the ~nly 
one who could have gIven 
such an order. 

That officer said he never 
gave the order. 

No formal charges were 
filed on either side after the 
incident.

Saxon to respond 
to investigation 
continued from page 3 
20 from Duane Sewell, assistant secretary of energy for 
defense programs. Sewell's letter outlined the DOE's concern 
over possible changes in the oversight and management of the 
two laboratories - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
and Los Alamos National Scientific Laboratory. 

The current five-year contracts under which UC has been 
managing the two laboratories expire in ept., 1982. Last 
September, the UC Board of Regent voted to instruct 
President Saxon to renegotiate contracts for the laboratorie 
for the period Oct. I, 1982 through Sept . 30. 1987. 

In Novemer. the Board approved a plan for improved 
oversight of the scientific and technical quality of re earch 
and for the health, safety and environmental 1 ues at the 
laboratorie at Livermore. California, and Los Alamo , New 
Mexie,o. 

Sewell' letter indicated that th D partment of Energy 
expects to complete what it calls the "compete/extend review 
process" by March 1981. The outcom will determine if the 
Department of Energy will entertain" mpetition" for a new 
contra tor for management of the laboratorie or will
