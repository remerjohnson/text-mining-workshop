REC BOARD 
EXPLORES 
BUDGET 
OPTIONS

By Matthew L’Heureux
Senior Staff Writer

Following heated debate regarding 
student representation in the layout 
of the RIMAC Annex, the Athletic, 
Recreation and Sports Facilities 
Advisory Board has recommended the 
implementation of two ad-hoc com-
mittees that would oversee the use of 
the campus’ intercollegiate athletics and 
sports facilities and recreation fees.

ARSFAB Student co-Chair Dan 
Palay, who made the recommenda-
tion at the board’s last meeting, said  
the committees will help cultivate a 
motivated core group experienced with 
handling budgetary matters, a skill that 
has taken past members several quar-
ters to develop.

“Too often, ARSFAB takes a while 
to get moving because it doesn’t have 
people trained to look at budgets,” 
Palay said.

Palay said that while ARSFAB has 
a relatively high annual turnover rate 
among members, he hoped the commit-
tees’ membership would be “less fluid.”

While he said that the committees

Israeli, Palestinian Youths Promote Cooperation

By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer

A group of Israeli and Palestinian 
youth activists spoke at UCSD last 
week as part of an effort to spread 
a message of peace for their embat-
tled home region and advocate a 
two-state solution to the ongoing 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The OneVoice movement, an 
international nonpartisan grass-
roots organization, stopped in San 
Diego on April 24 for the final 
leg of its Southern California 
tour. Sponsored by the Americans 
for Informed Democracy and 
the Organization for Muslim 
and Jewish Awareness, the event 
allowed OneVoice to spread aware-
ness about ways to promote peace 
in the region. 

OneVoice representative Laurel 
Rapp said it is not always clear 
to people outside of Palestine and 
Israel that the region’s inhabitants 
want to arrive at an agreement 
through nonviolent means. 

In order to further their goal 
of spreading this sentiment, the 
organization seeks to acquire one 
million signatures by the end of 
the year from those sympathetic 
to the cause in order to demon-

strate to the leadership and people 
on both sides of the conflict that 
demand for peaceful resolution 
exists among those affected by the 
situation.  

“The majority [of Israelis and 
Palestinians] want to achieve res-
olution nonviolently,” Rapp said. 
“There are about 300,000 Israelis 
and 300,000 Palestinians who have 
signed the OneVoice mandate. Our 
goal isn’t to change people’s minds 
but to start a thinking process. It’s 
already what most people want and 
we’re just amplifying the voice of 
the Palestinian and Israeli people.”

Shani Gershon, a OneVoice repre-
sentative from Jerusalem, spoke about 
the challenges she faces in Israel while 
handing out pamphlets that publicize 
the organization’s mandate. 

“They would read it and say 
it’s great but wouldn’t want to sign 
because they thought the Palestinians 
would not sign it,” she said. “What 
motivated them was that I told them 
I had a Palestinian counterpart saying 
the exact same thing.” 

Co-president of OMJA and 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more Marina Triner, who lived in 
Israel, said that as an American 
student she has had the opportu-
nity to view the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict from a point of view to 
which she would not otherwise be 
exposed to.

“I believe it’s my duty to impact 
the situation in my home country 
because I am removed from the

UCSD Enters Stem-Cell 
Research Partnership

By Christina Homer
Senior Staff Writer

Four major research institutions 
are joining to form a cutting-edge San 
Diego Consortium on Regenerative 
Medicine, which will draw togeth-
er a number of major resources in 
the field in an attempt to further 
develop regenerative science. UCSD, 
the Scripps Research Institute, the 
Burnham Institute for Medical 
Research and the Salk Institute will 
be equal partners in the collabora-
tion. 

The SDCRM is working on a major 
facilities grant from the California 
Institute for Regenerative Medicine, 

which was created after voters passed 
Proposition 71 in 2004. The amount 
of the grant will be determined at a 
meeting of CIRM’s governing board  
early next month. If the funds are 
granted, the facility must be finished 
within two years.

The goal of the SDCRM is to 
promote collaboration between lead-
ing biologists, physicians, engineers, 
physicists, chemists, computer sci-
entists and bioethicists. It will pool 
resources to buy state-of-the-art tools 
and instruments. In addition, the 
consortium will recruit and train new 
researchers in stem-cell research.

“The consortium provides an addi-
tional catalyst for collaboration among 
the great research organizations here 
in San Diego,” John Reed, CEO of the 
Burnham Institute, said in an e-mail.

According to Reed, the Burnham 
Institute has a long-standing commit-
ment to stem-cell research dating back 

Consortium to lead 
increased research on 
regenerative medicine 
with help from state 
facilities grant.

Proposal Would Increase 
Union Strike Capabilities

The state Public Employee 
Relations Board has issued a pro-
posal that legalizes unfair-labor-
practice strikes by public employ-
ees throughout California. If final-
ized, the proposal will represent a 
victory for the California Nurses 
Association — among other labor 
unions — which is currently amid 
efforts to bargain over patient care 
issues.

PERB administrative law judge 
Donn Ginoza’s order found that 
the University of California violated 
the law by refusing to bargain over 
the union’s staffing proposal and 
by concealing information from 
nurses about patient classification 
systems used to determine staff-
ing decisions.

Unless it is appealed, the pro-
posed ruling will be finalized on 
May 8.

The proposed ruling would 
require the UC system to negoti-
ate patient-care issues raised by 
nurses in future talks and to pub-
licly post decisions in all of its 
medical facilities.

The case dates back to a 
one-day CNA strike in July 2005 
regarding the university’s alleged 
failure to bargain in good faith 
over nurse and other staffing prac-
tices. The UC system obtained a 
court injunction to block the strike 
just hours before it was scheduled 
to begin.

“This is a refreshing acknowl-
edgement of the fundamental, 
democratic right of California pub-
lic employees to strike — and a 
stunning rebuke for the university’s 

attempts to silence the collective 
voice of UC nurses,” Geri Jenkins, 
a member of the union council of 
presidents, said in a statement.

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said 
the university is reviewing the pro-
posed ruling and will likely appeal 
it.

“We are very disappointed in 
the decision as we think it fails to 
reinforce the joint duty that labor 
and management have to resolve 
disputes at the bargaining table 
and protect against conduct such 
as strikes that threaten public 
safety,” he said in a statement.

If the UC system does contest 
it, Schwartz said the ruling will not 
take effect until it is resolved by 
the full board.

would not have any immediate role in 
the annex project, which was criticized 
by several members of the A.S. Council 
for what they labeled as a lack of student 
input in its planning, Palay predicted 
that they would become involved when 
the annex’s budget is released.

“I’ve been tossing the idea around 
for a while, and with this new contro-
versy over the RIMAC Annex … the 
committees seem logical,” he said.

Palay’s commit-
tees will determine 
a student-to-staff 
member ratio based 
on ARSFAB’s cur-
rent makeup or, 
in the case of the 
sports facilities and 
recreation fee, pro-
portional to the 
percentage paid by 
students.

Sports Facilities 
Director Donald 
Chadwick said that 
while further communication regard-
ing the committees is necessary, he 
believes their implementation would 
have a positive impact on ARSFAB.

“I personally think that it’s a good 
idea and will provide an opportunity 
for board members to examine bud-
get and policy recommendations more 
closely,” he said. “I also wouldn’t be op-
posed to a recommendation that the 
committees be made into permanent 
standing committees of ARSFAB if 
that is what our board would like to 
do.”

However, ARSFAB member and 
Registration Fee Advisory Committee 
Chair Garo Bournoutian said he felt the 
board’s problems run deeper than the 
high turnover rate of members.

“I don’t think [Palay’s] proposal will 
make any real positive change,” he said. 
“It will just introduce additional meet-

Director: Committees Will Allow 
Closer Budgetary Discretion

▶ BUDGET, from page 1 ings in an already unenthused board. 
Most likely the subcommittees will be 
poorly attended.”

Bournoutian said he proposed an 
alternative division at the last ARSFAB 
meeting, which would have effectively 
split the board into two committees 
similar to those envisioned by Palay. 
Instead of serving as advisory com-
mittees to the greater ARSFAB board, 
however, Bournoutian’s committees 
would have replaced them. 

T h o u g h 
Bournoutian said 
student mem-
bers of ARSFAB 
raised few objec-
tions to his pro-
posal, he encoun-
tered “significant 
opposition” from 
Chadwick and 
Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue, who 
argued that the 
board’s three cen-

tral topics — facilities, athletics and 
recreation — work closely together and 
should remain a single entity.

“My current feeling is that [admin-
istrators] would not like to see the 
board split up,” Bournoutian said.

Regarding the annex, Chadwick 
said student opinion will be considered 
when naming rooms within the build-
ing, selecting a vendor to operate the 
planned cafe space and determining 
the facility’s hours of operation.

“Additional student input is impor-
tant and will continue to be necessary 
for the annex as well as other planned 
sports facilities,” he said.

Palay said he hopes to have the 
committees staffed and operational 
within the next few weeks.

11 years when it created a specific 
research division dedicated to the field 
and began recruiting scientists.

“Our expertise in stem-cell research, 
combined with the talents of our part-
ners, will ensure rapid progress toward 
innovative cell-based therapies for 
many debilitating and life-threatening 
diseases,” Reed said. “We have always 
believed that collaboration is the key 
to successfully tackling tough medi-
cal problems. Collaboration is at the 
core of the Burnham culture. We are 
proud and excited to be a member of 
the consortium that will lead the world 
in stem-cell biology and regenerative 
medicine.” 

Working with CIRM, the consor-
tium will also create new laborato-
ries that are safe harbors for stem-cell 
research  free from federal restrictions.

SDCRM will be performing medi-
cal research in the fields of neurology, 
cardiology, ophthalmology, hematol-
ogy, oncology and endocrinology. 

In coordination with the consor-
tium, the Scripps Research Institute has 
created a new Center for Regenerative 
Medicine, naming Jeanne F. Loring as 
its head.

Loring, who recently conducted 
research at the Burnham Institute, said 
she has a clear vision for the new lab.

“Since I have been at two of the 
institutes in the consortium, I think I 
have a pretty good feeling for how it 
will work,” Loring said.

Just as SDCRM will function as a 
forum to bring together leading scien-
tists from each of the institutions, the  
Center for Regenerative Medicine at 
Scripps will be an internal mechanism 
to unite scientists who are working on 
stem cells and create an interdisciplin-
ary environment.  

A 1,000-square-foot space has been 
allocated for running NIH-sponsored 
human embryonic stem-cell labora-
tory courses to train future scientists. 
However, Loring said most research 
will occur in individual scientists’ labo-
ratories.  

“The center is not so much a physi-
cal space but more of a group of people 
working together,” she said.

According to Loring, Scripps’ 
Center for Regenerative Medicine will 
be important because it brings  the 
institute’s strength in drug development 
to SDCRM. Using molecular biology 
and genomics, scientists can convert 
embryonic stem cells into a variety 
of different organ tissues on which to 
perform drug screening. 

In this way, scientists can determine

▶ RESEARCH, from page 1 drugs’ positive and negative side effects 

on different parts of the human body 
without actually performing tests on 
human beings.

Loring said she is excited about 
SDCRM’s potential. 

“The consortium gives us breadth 
in a lot of different areas of expertise,” 
she said.

Surprisingly, the construction of the 
new centers is not causing very much 
controversy over the use of embryonic 
stem cells, said Burnham Institute Vice 
President of Communications Andrea 
Moser. Instead, Moser said the main 
criticism involves SDCRM’s planned 
location, which lies adjacent to the 
Torrey Pines Gliderport.

A meeting took place last week 
where community members discussed 
their concerns about how the building 
will impact the local community.

The planned $115-million main 
facility, the “collaboratory,” will be built 
on 7.5 acres of UCSD land near the gli-
derport. Glider enthusiasts are worried 
that the center will be too close to their 
unpaved airstrip, which is located on 
UCSD-owned land, and used intermit-
tently by glider pilots to launch over the 
Pacific Ocean. The planned 60-foot-tall 
building is not expected to have any 
impact on hang gliders.

Supporters of the lab’s construc-
tion point out that the building would 
not be any taller than the surrounding 
eucalyptus trees, which do not seem 
to pose a problem to the pilots. In 
an editorial last week, the [San Diego 
Union-Tribune] said, “It would be a 
tragedy of enormous proportions if 
glider advocates succeeded in snuffing 
out this promising initiative.”

However, Rolf Schulze, president of 
the Associated Glider Clubs of Southern 
California, said lab planners should 
explore other construction sites.

“UCSD owns many other nearby 
sections of land that would be even 
more suitable for the stem-cell facility, 
while not resulting in the destruction 
of a world-renowned and historic avia-
tion facility used by Charles Lindbergh 
and many other aviation pioneers,” he 
said. 

The California Coastal Commission 
and Caltrans will both have to approve 
the lab’s construction.

The Historical Resources 
Commission in Napa, Calif. is con-
sidering expanding the borders of the 
gliderport in the National Register of 
Historic Places to protect it.

she said. 

Rapp said that OneVoice differs 
from other conflict-resolution groups 
in that it does not 
strive for imme-
diate peace, but 
rather works to 
mobilize people

leaders.

“When you 
hear ‘peace

line them in a box 
because some 
are unrealistic,

she said. 

Triner said that one of OneVoice’s 
primary goals is to influence mem-
bers of the youth demographic, who 
will eventually inherit the problems 
that exist in the region today.

“As young people, we have the

said that OneVoice’s efforts play a 
significant role in properly educat-

Nair said. “In

stay apathetic to the news, but these 
issues affect people worldwide and 
it’s important to think about their

plished, but the stark reality that 
the festival has been engraved in 
students’ minds as the day to gorge 
themselves on alcohol and partake 
in other illicit activities will become 
irrefutably evident.

Since early October, the plan-
ning committee, composed of stu-
dents, staff and UC security, has met 
periodically in an attempt to prevent 
some of the problems that plagued 
last year’s festival caused the event 
to be deemed a complete disaster. 
After receiving complaints ranging 
from a lack of sufficient food and 
water to student grievances against 
the use of undercover police, the 
committee gathered these criticisms 
to compile a Sun God Planning 
Report, which listed both com-
plaints and suggestions about how 
to amend the festival. 

Though the list of goals and rec-
ommendation seemed endless, most 
of the material revolved around one 
pressing issue: The campus should 
create a Sun God Festival more 
oriented around the UCSD com-
munity. For example, students have 
traditionally thought of Sun God 
as a day to play hooky in order to 
get so drunk that the concert por-
tion of the day becomes an obscure 
memory. However, in their attempt 
to make Sun God a euphoric expe-
rience through illicit means, stu-
dents are agitating the university by 
getting arrested and thus, tarnish-
ing the reputation of Sun God and 
UCSD. 

This cause and effect was illus-
trated by more than 355 arrests on 
campus throughout the day of the 
festival last year. How does the plan-
ning committee attempt to solve 
this? Uniformed officers from other 
universities will be pooled together 
in order to act as surrogates for 
undercover police and local vol-
unteers, who made up the major-
ity of the policing force last year. 
Uniformed police were requested 
this year because they make their 
presence clear. The utter audacity it 
takes to reform such a long-stand-
ing image is praiseworthy, but one 
can immediately understand how 
the individual responsible for this 
idea was oblivious to the foresee-
able blatant holes in this logic. By 
employing officers who will arrest 
a fewer number of students, which 
seems to be the only logical reason 
different police offers were hired, 
it only seems reasonable to assume 
there will be even more intoxicated 
people at the festival. 

Thus, the change will only be 
cosmetic because it simply evades 
the issue at hand. While statisti-
cally, this year will be called a suc-
cess since fewer people are expect-
ed to be arrested, future festivals 
may encourage more students to 
get drunk since the risk of getting 
caught will have diminished greatly 
with student-friendly cops. 

Another major reformation will 
be in the entrance setup, which also 
poses ways for students to sidestep 

the righteous goals the planning 
committee has set. Instead of using 
ID scanners, students will only need 
their ID cards and a wristband, 
which will be distributed a few days 
before the festival for both entry and 
re-entry (yes, the school decided to 
rescind the no re-entry rule). These 
changes may seem convenient, but 
as pessimistic as it may sound, giv-
ing students the right to come and 
go as they please throughout the day 
seems like a marvelous opportunity 
for students to go get drunk, sober 
up and then go get even more drunk 
in their dorms to repeat the intoxi-
cated cycle. Thus, like the new secu-
rity plans, the re-entry policy will be 
another superficial alteration to Sun 
God that may actually encourage 
a diametrically opposite outcome 
from what the planning commit-
tee originally hoped — there won’t 
be less drunkards, just less causing 
trouble or getting caught. 

Now, I would be willing to forgive 
these futile, yet virtuous, attempts to 
revamp Sun God, but after hearing 
about a festival budget that sur-
passes last year’s — totaling up to 
$400,000 — and the lineup (which 
is made up of artists who are seldom 
considered to be in vogue, except 
among middle schoolers), the likeli-
hood of redemption is slim to none. 
Not only could the school have 
made more substantial changes with 
a $400,000 budget, such as the artist 
selection, but also, the question of 
where the university’s priorities are 
comes to mind. Instead of spend-
ing money on one day, which, in all 
likelihood, will not be remembered 

I would like to take a moment to follow up on some previous ideas. Two weeks ago I wrote a column 
for the sports section talking about 
the lack of an intense baseball rivalry 
between SoCal and NorCal fans. I had 
gone to a Padres-Dodgers game wear-
ing San Francisco Giants’ gear and 
cheering my lungs out for my boys in 
orange and black, yet didn’t really get 
heckled or yelled at. In my column I 
called on SoCalers to take on a more 
active role in the north-south rivalry 
both for the fun of the game and to 
enhance the ballpark experience. 

Last Wednesday night I returned 
to Petco Park, this time to root for 
my hometown Giants, except instead 
of encountering the previously 
described “high levels of Southern 
California complacency,” my friends 
and I experienced the worst type of 
regionally motivated cheering, mak-
ing me realize that there is a very thin 
line between taking a sports rivalry 
seriously and being downright igno-
rant. 

I was born and raised in San 
Francisco; the city is as dear to me 
as any aspect of my personality, and I 
have as much pride in my roots as is 
humanly possible. I can rattle off the 
best restaurants in every neighbor-
hood, I know which parks are the best 
to go drinking at with your friends 
on a foggy Friday night and above 
all I brag about the fact that my city 
is the most diverse and accepting in 
the country. 

In my sports column I said that 
following a baseball team was about 
more than just casually knowing stats 
and cheering on a group of 25 grown 
men — it was about having pride in 
where you are from and not letting 
anybody take that away from you. I 
still believe that having a connection 
with your team is an important part 
of being a sports fan, but being called 
a faggot for 13 innings will make you 
realize that sports offer a very danger-
ous outlet for some people. 

I really try not to judge people 
based on where they’re from, so why 
did it seem like every Padres fan 
Wednesday night went out of their 
way to call me and my friends gay 
solely because we were rooting for 
the San Francisco Giants? For the first 
nine innings of the game, our group 
was sitting in the upper reserve and 
a group of Padres fans planted them-
selves behind us and proceeded to yell 
every antigay slur known to man. 

Forget about the fact that there 
was a family with four young kids 
sitting in the row immediately below 
us, forget that the hecklers were prob-
ably three or four deep into their 
nightly beer count — what makes 
me the most mad is the simple fact 
that people like that still think that 
what they do is completely accept-
able. It took every ounce of strength 
and integrity in my body to not turn 
around and yell back at them, or more 
temptingly, to punch the guy in his

by the students, many of whom will 
be inebriated, the university should 
spend the money on things that are 
beneficial to students, such as park-
ing spaces, smaller classes and more 
classes, to name a few.

While the planning committee’s 
efforts should be extolled, the fes-
tival, which has been embraced by 
students as a “binge-all-you-want” 
day, will continue to hold this 
reputation until one of two things 
occurs. First, the university could 
undergo a “Sun God culture cleans-
ing” by hiring the most authoritar-
ian police force it can find to arrest 
everyone who has even a whiff of 
alcohol on their breath in order 
to scare students from drinking, 
which will also subsequently have 
the effect of eliminating all hype 
and anticipation students have for 
the festival. Or two, (my personal 
favorite) the university could con-
duct more efforts to teach students 
how to approach the act of drinking 
and its relationship to the festival. 
In other words, UCSD should try 
to educate students about the harm-
ful effects of drinking and why it 
should only be done in moderation. 
Until one of these two things occurs, 
students will be impervious to the 
tweaks the planning committee may 
throw at them in order to force 
them into drinking less. Instead, the 
tweaks will be deflected as cosmetic 
changes, while the core of Sun God 
will revolve around taking shots and 
getting high.

Despite lengthy administrative and student debates, changes to this year’s festival look to be 
nothing more than a shopping spree: expensive, excessive and ultimately ineffective.

MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Spending Abroad Harms 
Domestic Innocents 

Dear Editor,
On Jan. 10, Gov. Arnold 

Schwarzenegger released his state 
budget proposal for 2008-09. His 
budget release included massive 
cuts of over $1 billion to high-
er education. Over 3.2 million 
University of California, California 
State University and California 
Community College students will 
be adversely affected by the pro-
posed budget cuts.

The state budget cannot con-
tinually be balanced on the backs of 
students. These budget cuts heavily 
impact the core educational institu-
tions of our state, proposing to take 
$483 million from community col-
leges, $312.9 million from the CSU 
system and $331.9 million from the 
UC system.

These cuts would directly trans-
late into thousands of students 
turned away at the doors of higher 
education institutions. In the com-
ing year as many as 50,000 students 
could be barred from California’s 
most accessible means of higher 
education, the community colleges; 
10,000 qualified students could be 
denied from the CSU system and 
UC students will struggle to afford 
the 94-percent tuition increase 
since 2001.

The 1960 California Master 
Plan promised to find a place in 
the California Higher Education 

System for every qualified student. 
Almost half a century later, this 
promise is on the verge of extinc-
tion. Together, we represent the 
nearly three million students who 
attend community colleges, CSUs 
and the UC system. Each of us 
believes that education is vital to 
the growth of California’s econo-
my and instrumental in improving 
the quality of life for everyone. We 
believe that a quality and afford-
able education should be available 
to every Californian who desires to 
pursue one. Education is a means to 
a better life, a more peaceful world 
and a better California.

It is time to end the days when 
legislative accountability is skirt-
ed, gubernatorial responsibility is 
ignored and California’s future is 
relegated to the sidelines. Students 
throughout California are realizing 
that the time for action is now. For 
too long, our state leaders have 
attempted to balance the budget on 
the backs of students.

The University of California 
Student Association, the California 
State Student Association and 
the Student Senate for California 
Community Colleges have joined 
together to form a coalition, 
Students for California’s Future. On 
April 21, we held actions all across 
the state to say “No more” to the 
attacks on our higher education 
system and reclaim the promise for 
California’s future.

Just as leaders in the 1960s built 
the California Master Plan, calling 

for a strong K-12 education system 
and a three-pronged approach to 
address the state’s diverse higher-
education needs, we are coming 
together to revive the California 
dream. It is time that we make clear 
what California’s priorities are, and, 
once again, take pride in our educa-
tion system.

homophobic little face. We didn’t sink 
to their level — instead we enjoyed 
the amazing pitching duel between 
Matt Cain and Greg Maddux, trying 
hard to ignore the rants emanating 
over our shoulders. 

For these types of people, a sports 
game has nothing 
to do with what 
they are yell-
ing. Yeah, they 
seemed to yell 
more loudly after 
the Padres got a 
hit or struck out 
a Giant, but the 
game was sim-
ply an excuse to 
be an asshole in 
public. 

Once extra innings got underway, 
we moved down to the lower box seats, 
and even there we couldn’t shake the 
anti-San Francisco homophobia that 
seemed to be as abundant as strikeouts 
that night. After seeing that a group 
of us, all wearing San Francisco gear, 
moved into his section, one particular 
man moved down 10 rows in order to 
sit right behind us. For three innings 
(right until Emmanuel Burris hit a 
double that sparked the Giants eventu-
al game-winning rally) this man yelled 
into our ears that we should return to 
where we belonged: “the gay bay.” 

I would really like to believe that 
our society is above this, but obvi-
ously there are way too many people 

who are not just content to simply 
be ignorant but also feel the need to 
express their ignorance out loud, and 
if their open forum happens to be at 
a sporting event, then that’s all the 
better for them. Even in the online 
comments from my sports column, 
one reader wrote: “Screw the Giants, 

I hate all you little 
Gay SAN FAGS.” 

It’s one thing 
if somebody is a 
homophobe, albeit 
unfortunate, but 
that just happens to 
be his or her per-
sonal opinion. But 
to make a point to 
use an innocent 
sporting event as 
a platform for gay 

bashing is unacceptable. 
An ignorant person calling me 

gay doesn’t bother me, but what if 
there had actually been a gay man or 
woman sitting within earshot? What 
about some young, impressionable 
kids who then think its OK to drop 
f-bombs? Saying those things repeat-
edly may desensitize some people, 
making them slowly forget the hor-
rible consequences that homophobia 
has had in American society. 

Don’t get me wrong, baseball 
is my passion, but sitting through 
Wednesday night’s San Francisco 
hate-fest made me realize that if this 
is what sports have become, then it’s 
not worth it.

L abs at UCSD and around San Diego are investigat-ing the medicinal value and 
addictive qualities of cannabis, 
the drug that, according to the 
United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime, is used by approxi-
mately 162 million people each 
year.

Like many other recreational 
drugs, marijuana binds to the 
brain’s receptors. Receptors 
are similar to keyholes, which 
release an effect throughout the 
body when the correct link is 
made. However, unlike many of 
the body’s other compounds, the 
brain has receptors that respond 
specifically to chemicals found 
in marijuana, called cannabinoid 
receptors. These receptors trig-
ger physical rewards in the body 
during exercise, in what UCSD 
School of Medicine professor of 
anesthesiology Dr. Mark Wallace 
likens to “the runner’s high.”

The most common cannabi-
noid in marijuana is tetrahydro-
cannabinol, or THC. According 
to Wallace, there are over 450 
compounds within the plant that 
contribute to marijuana’s effects.

Wallace’s most recent study on 
cannabinoids involved 15 healthy 
individuals who inhaled mari-
juana and endured pain from a 
forearm injection of capsaicin, 
the compound that produces the 
spicy sensation in chili peppers.

Wa l l a c e 
found that if 
capsaicin was injected 45 minutes 
after a subject smoked marijuana, 
there was a significant decrease 
in pain. However, if capsaicin was 
administered five minutes after 
the subject smoked, there was no 
significant decrease in pain. In 
addition, Wallace found that task 
performance and motor skills in 
his study were not significantly 
impaired with a dose of 4 percent 
THC marijuana.  

“This study was conducted to 
put the debated pain-relieving 
quality of cannabis to the test,” 
Wallace said. “We were shown 
that there is a potential benefit 
in using cannabis moderately to 
treat patients with chronic pain.”

Wallace’s study was funded 
by SB 847, a bill signed into 
effect by former Gov. Gray Davis 
in 1999. The legislation allowed 
the University of California to 
establish a California Medical 
Marijuana Research Program. 
With this bill, as well as the 1996 
State Proposition 215, the Center 
for Medical Cannabis Research 
was established. Based in San 
Diego and affiliated with UCSD, 
the center gathers researchers 
to answer the ultimate question 

involving marijuana — is it 
genuinely therapeutic 
and effective enough 
for medicinal use? 

“The ultimate goal 
for the CMCR is to test 
the safety and efficacy 
of using cannabis and 
its compounds in medical 
treatment,” CMCR repre-
sentative Heather Bentley 
said. “This goal holds par-
ticularly true in situations 
where there are no other 
solutions for patients who 
suffer from chronic pain 
and or illness.”

Bentley said cancer, 
AIDS, obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder, dia-
betes, multiple-sclerosis 
and depression have all 
been medically treated with the 
use of marijuana with some suc-
cess.  

While UCSD heads many 
cannabis experiments, it receives 
all research marijuana from 
one government-funded source 
— the University of Mississippi 
— which is governed by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
the sole American contractor that 
has been growing legal marijuana 
since 1974.

At the Scripps Research 
Institute, NIDA is supplying 
another project with drastically 
different goals. SRI Professor 

Barbara Mason is heading 
a study that will look at addic-
tion as a reason for constant mar-
ijuana relapses. 

Participants in Mason’s study 
are required to be regular mari-
juana users and are paid to not 
smoke. They are given a medica-
tion which abruptly blocks can-
nabinoid receptors, creating a 
full-scale withdrawal from mari-
juana for day. This allows Mason 
and her colleagues to study mari-
juana withdrawal within a short 
period of time, whereas natu-
ral withdrawal usually lasts for 

months.
“ O u r 

s t u d y

abuse and

it affects 
h i g h e r 
c o g n i -

tive func-
tioning, like 

reasoning, decision making and 
problem solving,” Mason said. 
“We are trying to characterize 
marijuana withdrawal.”

Mason said one of the most 
prevalent symptoms of marijuana 
withdrawal is sleep disturbances, 
characterized by strange dreams 
and interruptions that can last 
months after a user quits smok-
ing. Other symptoms include

LA JOLLA THE LOW DOWN ON LAVISH LA JOLLA HOUSING FROM STUDENT RESIDENTS.C lose to bus lines, shops and beaches, the La Jolla/UTC area is great for the quiet, car-less student. But much like living on the oh-so-nearby campus, restaurants and shops close early, and you definitely have to keep the noise down or beware of potentially expensive security visits. Guardian reporters give you a look inside to help weigh the good with the bad before settling on these affluent apartment digs because if you’re willing to pay, nothing beats the commute.

T he physical layout of the Verano condos is, for lack of a better term, ridiculously he physical layout of the Verano condos is, for lack of a better term, ridiculously pleasant. The sprawling, garden-style complex is characterized by long, tree-lined walkways and perfectly manicured lawns. Hummingbirds flit restlessly among 
long-stemmed tropical plants that rise serenely from countless oversized stone flow-
erpots, and the sparkling ivory spires of the Mormon temple tower majestically above 
Verano’s quaint, tile rooftops. The people who run the place, however, are a great deal 
less inviting. The management appears to be a group of cantankerous, youth-hating 
security enthusiasts who get a kick out of towing cars from the complex’s limited open 
parking areas, and as for maintenance — don’t count on getting that broken dryer fixed 
anytime soon.

Apartment ComplexLa Regencia
I f you’re going the La Jolla apartment route you should definitely consider La Regencia. With all the typical amenities — washer/dryer, community gym and pool — the complex is pretty standard. What makes it worth a second look is its proxim-
ity to a myriad of useful resources. It’s right beside Vons, the Arriba shuttle stop and 
Mexican, sushi and pizza joints. The residents, mostly students and families with rowdy Mexican, sushi and pizza joints. The residents, mostly students and families with rowdy 
little kids, are generally easy going, jimmying the complex doors to stay open so you 
don’t need to carry extra keys and ignoring some occasional noise. But like any La Jolla 
apartment, the places are on the smaller side and the price is on the bigger — conve-
nience doesn’t come for free.

D on’t go on vacation. Live it, at La Jolla Crossroads.” The slogan of this grandiose apartment complex magically floats through your ears as you enter through a driveway flanked by palm trees and whitewashed buildings. Then, your butt sud-
denly jolts off your seat as your car madly shakes from the newly installed, wretchedly denly jolts off your seat as your car madly shakes from the newly installed, wretchedly 
tall speed bumps. Crossroads offers beautiful facilities including an indoor theater with 
38 leather lounge chairs, an oasis spa, a racquetball court, free tanning beds and multiple 
pools, to say the least. Yet the facade of this heavenly resort fades with residents kicking 
in the security-locked doors instead of using their high-tech keys and elevators deciding 
to malfunction by skipping the third floor and going straight to the fifth instead. I haven’t 
used any of their facilities and I keep missing the free Monday-night yoga classes, but the 
defects make the fantastic paradise into home. 

Walk-Up Apartments

T here’s a good chance you’ve never noticed the second-floor apart-ments in the La Jolla Village 
Center shopping complex, or have 
even given serious consideration to 
living in a mall. Following the classic 
real-estate mantra, however, LJVC is 
a prime place to live for three rea-
sons: location, location, location.

Imagine waking up in the morn-

ing to the smell of Peet’s Coffee, or 
being able to walk to Rubio’s when 
you’re hungry or CVS Pharmacy 
when you need toilet paper. For a 
small complex, there’s pretty much 
nothing — including UCSD — that’s 
more than a short walk away.

To be fair, the amenities are kind 
of sparse — there’s no gym and only 
three washers/dryers for almost 40 

apartments — but at $1,475/month 
for a two-bedroom, it’s slightly 
cheaper than most of what you’ll 
find in La Jolla. Add that to the 
money you save on a parking pass, 
and you’ll probably have enough 
left over for a midweek celebration 
at TGI Friday’s, which you’ll hap-
pily discover is only a parking lot’s 
stumble away.

I f you’re looking for a quiet place to study that’s close to every-thing, the Genesee Vista Condos 
complex your best choice. Located 
right off of Genesee Avenue, it’s 
only a 15-minute walk to the 
Regents shuttle stop or a five-min-
ute drive to campus. Westfield 
Shoppingtown UTC, Costa Verde 
Center and Regents Plaza are in 
close walking or biking distance. 

The apartments are of a decent 
size with patio seating and indoor 
washers and dryers — big enough 
to house two to three roommates. 
The worst part is the parking. With 
few guest spots in the lot and limit-
ed street parking, it’s hard to throw 
a party. And if you plan on staying 
out late, it’s almost guaranteed that 
once you leave your street parking, 
you won’t get it back.

Condominums

I f you’re looking for more privacy with-out the commute, one of La Jolla’s two Playmor condo complexes is your best 
near-campus bet. Because of the condo 
setup you share fewer walls with neighbors 
and have a relatively roomy fenced-in patio 
perfect for summer barbecuing, without 
giving up the proximity to campus or com-

munity pool. Both complexes are within 
walking distance of a UCSD shuttle stop 
and local restaurants. Many of the condos 
are privately owned, so price, quality and 
service vary, but this can also work to your 
advantage — pets are generally allowed 
and some chill landlords even let you paint 
the place as you like.

A part from the always-present threat of complaining neighbors who abhor noise and fun, Costa Verde is an ideal 
living place for students looking to get off 
campus. With a hotel-like layout character-
ized by monotonous, white-walled hall-
ways, gaudy Vegas-inspired carpeting and 
floor upon floor of identical, bare-bones 
residences, the place isn’t a far cry from the 
dorms. The apartments are spacious, unas-

suming and altogether fairly conducive 
to partying. Feel free to spill beer on the 
carpet and break holes in the walls as you’re 
going to end up sacrificing a good-sized 
chunk of your $500 deposit anyway for 
a mandatory, post-move-out professional 
cleaning. Also, unless you’re lucky enough 
to get an assigned spot in the underground 
garage, get used to taking long walks home 
from remote parking locations.

RESIDENT Pacific Beach

U nhappy with your social experi-ence at UCSD? Move to Pacific Beach! With a brimming night-
life, marked diversity and a laidback 
beach vibe, PB has everything UCSD 
lacks, making it the perfect comple-
ment to college life in San Diego.

PB is the square grid sandwiched 
between downtown La Jolla and 
Mission Bay, stretching from I-5 
to the beach. Garnet Avenue is the 
gateway to this eclectic beach town 
and the quirky mix of thrift shops, 
yoga huts, tattoo parlors, bars, smoke 
shops and sushi restaurants hints at 
the diversity of residents. Everyone, 
from San Diego State frat boys to old 
surf rats, beachside vacationers to 
the coolest bums around, creates the 
stimulating atmosphere that is PB.

While traffic and parking can be 
an issue, living in PB solves all prob-
lems. There is always something to 
do just a short walk or bike ride 
away. The other vein of life perpen-
dicular to Garnet is the beach board-
walk, extending from Law Street to 
the Mission Beach jetty, where you 
will find a pulsing mass of skaters 
and bikers along with one particu-

lar rollerblader showing off his ice-
skating techniques to the classical 
music sounding from a speaker on 
his belt clip (you’ll know him when 
you see him.) The boardwalk is also 
home to one of the few youth hostels 
in San Diego, a Venice Beach-esque 
bazaar, a rollercoaster and a man-
made mechanical wave.

PB nightlife caters mostly to the 
21-plus crowd but young’uns can 
hang out at the 18-and-over hookah 
bar, Sinbad’s, or find a house party on 
every other block. While Garnet can 
succumb to a bro/ho scene at night, 
bars range from upscale to holes in 
the wall, many offering live music, so 
there is potential for everyone. Some 
fun options just around the corner 
from the main drag are Cass Street 
Bar and Grill, a nautically decorated 
sports bar complete with pool tables 
and shuffleboard, an Australian pub 
on the other side of Garnet and 
the PB Shoreclub, a favorite for its 
upstairs view of crashing waves. 

But more than partying is the life-
style that PB affords. Bike riding to the 
grocery store, happy hour and Taco 
Tuesday specials, sports bars each 

with their own favorite team, surfers 
crossing the street to the beach, board 
in hand, and a corner breakfast joint 
and coffee shop for every neighbor-
hood are just a few things that make 
San Diego feel like home, rather than 
just a place to go to school.

Where to live depends entirely 
on whether you want to be in the 
heart of downtown or in the more 
residential areas that surround it. 
Mission Beach is a unique strand 
that separates the beach from the bay 
with narrow alleyways connecting 
the two. But if you prefer a quieter 
community, life slows down a bit as 
you head north around Turquoise 
Street where longtime residents share 
the streets with students, waving 
friendly hellos as they walk by with 
their dogs. Housing gets more expen-
sive the closer you get to the beach, 
but you may find that the sound of 
waves and smell of salt is worth the 
extra buck. 

So all of you unsatisfied students 
have no excuse. Look no further 
than the crazy beach town off I-5 
to become that college town you’ve 
always dreamed of.

S tudents tired of La Jolla’s overtly expensive secluded blandness should consider moving to Mira 
Mesa, a quiet suburban hamlet com-
fortably nestled between I-15, Sorrento 
Valley and MCAS Miramar.

Located about 20 minutes away 
from UCSD and lined with cookie-
cutter housing tracks and numerous 
strategically placed shopping plazas, 
Mira Mesa is the perfect place for any 
college student on a tight budget. From 
a huge Asian market to Target to an 
IMAX movie theater to almost every 
fast-food joint imaginable (includ-
ing the down-home Cajun cookin’ of 
Popeyes), Mira Mesa has it all.

And if you get tired of grease-soaked 
takeout bags, never fear — Mira Mesa is 
loaded with delicious ethnic restaurants. 
Whether you choose to indulge in spicy, 
cheap, authentic Indian food at Punjabi 
Tandoor or the huge portions offered at 
Vietnamese eateries like Pho Hoa Cali, 
Mira Mesa’s diverse array of restaurants 
is sure to please any palate. Throw in 
a 24-hour Roberto’s smack dab in the 

middle of the neighborhood, and even 
the most finicky eaters are covered. 
(Seriously, who doesn’t like California doesn’t like California doesn’t
burritos at 3 a.m.?)

Instead of dealing with the hor-
rendous parking and paper-thin walls 
associated with almost every apart-
ment complex, in Mira Mesa you can 
easily find a spacious house (many 
have pools!) where you can have your 
own room for under $500, complete 
with a driveway, backyard and washer 
and dryer.

Although Mira Mesa lacks the bar 
scenes of Hillcrest and Pacific Beach 
and the commute to UCSD can at 
times be exasperating (get ready to 
leave at least 40 minutes before class), 
there are plenty of fun things to do 
in the area: Epicentre plays host to 
year-round concerts and the 44-alley 
Mira Mesa Lanes offers cheap bowling 
and beer. Try the Wacky Wednesday 
special for unlimited games for up to 
six people per lane from 9 p.m. to mid-
night for only $25, and you’re guaran-
teed to have a rollin’ good time.

UCSD Student Housing Poll 2008
Here’s what you had to say about life after dining halls and dreary dorms.



MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  15

pher just happened to stumble upon a 
basement full of fit, attractive young 
people wearing spandex or purple tri-
blend rompers (just $28).

The common thread that impress-
es me about these two bodies of work 
is the successful use of direct flash. 
Most photographers would agree that 
the use of direct flash — usually from 
a small strobe built into the camera 
itself — is one of the most common 
signs of an amateur and a stylistic 
faux pas to be avoided in almost all 
situations. It’s the type of lighting seen 
most often on Facebook, illuminating 
sweaty foreheads and giant pores, and 
responsible for the blown-out glow of 
dirty bathroom mirrors in so many 
self-portraits on Myspace.

I normally shun flash photogra-
phy as too intrusive and unnatural. 
For better or worse, it destroys the 
scene’s mood and replaces it with flat 
and uniform lighting. People change 
their behavior once they realize they’re 
being photographed, and what better 
way to announce that fact by a bright 
pulse of light emanating from your 
camera? After one discrete shot trig-
gers the flash, you can expect someone 
to pose in the next shot, likely with a 
stupid face or gang sign. More impor-
tantly, a powerful flash is annoying to 
most people and not something I’d 
prefer to do as a guest in someone’s 
home. But when my roommates and I 
hosted a party in our apartment a few 
months ago, I decided to take advan-
tage of being on my own turf by being 
an ass with a camera for the night and 
channel my inner Riis.

The result was similar to the hybrid 
I described earlier — halfway between 
concerned documentary photography 
and a fashion shoot. My photos had 
the antique look of early photography 
because of the black and white film I 
was using; I happened to develop the 

film in less than ideal conditions so 
that the emulsion warped and burned 
out in a few photos. The debauch-
ery provided enough illicit behavior 
for legitimate social concern, but the 
young crowd was having fun and was 
more worthy of an American Apparel 
catalog. I roamed the dark levels of my 
apartment, searching for unsuspecting 
subjects and blinding them with my 
flash, getting away before their retinas 
had time to recuperate. As the night 
drifted on, even that piercing torch 
struggled to arouse people’s attention 
away from the pounding dance music 
or finishing off the alcohol. One guest 
in particular was the star of the night, 
a petite partier who was even wearing 
an American Apparel dress. I checked 
in on her twice. The first time she was 
above the party, dancing on a chair. 
The second, she had changed elevation 
and was smiling serenely while lying 
on the floor.

I waited a few months to devel-
op my film from the night, and I 
was completely surprised by what I 
saw. The cloak of darkness had been 
lifted without anyone knowing, and 
even I saw things that I couldn’t see 
at the time. People were gyrating in 
plain sight for no obvious reason; 
bodies were heaped on each other 
in unabashed stupor and exhaustion. 
Instead of the calm, moody, selec-
tive-focus candid photos I am used to 
getting in such a setting, I got flailing 
arms and legs outlined by thin deep 
shadows as if someone had used a per-
manent marker. It was a society case 
worthy of Riis’ work, but the subject 
matter was decidedly more lightheart-
ed and attractive fare. It struck me that 
the choice of using flash had defined 
the story the pictures told.

“violent outbursts,” such as aggres-
sive behavior, anxiety attacks and 
difficulty concentrating. 

UCSD assistant professor of psy-
chiatry Dr. Susan Tapert will create 
magnetic resonance images of the 
brains of participants involved once 
the study moves past its initial stag-
es. The participants include some of 
UCSD’s own students. 

Tapert is particularly interested 
in how cannabis use affects long-
term development of the brain in 
adolescents and young adults.

“This matter is important to 
me because marijuana is so widely 
used,” Tapert said. “About 5 percent 
of high school seniors report using 
marijuana daily. It is import to 
understand its neurological effects, 
so that young adults are rightfully 
informed about the effects of mari-
juana use.” 

According to Mason, despite 
marijuana’s widespread use, its 
effects on the body and mind are 
hardly understood. Because mar-
ijuana’s long-term effects are still 
unknown, researchers like Tapert 
are focusing their attention on teens 
and young adults, like undergradu-
ates, whose learning abilities could 
be affected by the substance.

“Like with any substance, over-
use can bring undesired results,” 
Wallace said. “In the future, mar-
ijuana’s place in medicine will 
hopefully be understood, as well 
its adverse effects on the mind and 
body.”

inFOCUS Eco–conscious students sort through half a ton of trash in Price Center to reveal UCSD’s recycling habits.
This year UCSD celebrated going green during Earth Week by challenging students to “Choose to Change,” 
a theme that  highlighted the many ways 
affiliates can help sustain the environment. 
On April 22, students got down in the dumps 
— literally — by sorting through more than 
1,000 pounds of garbage collected from 
trash cans in Price Center to pick out the 
recyclable material that is normally thrown 
away. The sorting took under an hour, 
but participants uncovered more than 300 
pounds of recyclables, from cans and 
bottles to newspapers and cardboard. The 
trash sort aimed to combat student apathy 
for recycling and promote less waste. 

light, though, with options ranging 
from cheap fast food drive-thrus to 
five-star restaurants. Within a two-
block radius of my house, I can 
grab some Greek food or New York 
style pizza, choose from one of two 
24-hour Mexican food places, or 
go to my personal favorite, Sushi 
Deli One, where the dirt-cheap 
sushi combined with the sake and 
beer drink special make it worth the 
hour-long wait.

The nightlife in what locals call the 
“Gayborhood” is obviously oriented 

toward a specific crowd, but for the 
straight and single, there are a few 
bars in Hillcrest and a lot more in 
North Park, which is only a cheap cab 
ride away. In Hillcrest, a stretch on 
University Avenue in between Sixth 
and 10th Avenues has a great combina-
tion of different types of bars and clubs, 
like Alibi or the just-opened Universal.

Whether you prefer to base your 
housing choice on nightlife, food 
or convenient commuting options, 
Hillcrest is a great place to call home 
while you finish up your college 
career in San Diego.

MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  19

Allison May grounded a hard shot right 
back up the middle, but San Francisco 
State’s pitcher gloved it and threw to 
first to end the game. 

Game two saw similar theatrics 
with another seventh-inning rally, only 
this time it was done by San Francisco 
State, and the Gators succeeded in 
forcing extra innings; UCSD would 
eventually lose after nine innings. The 
Tritons scored first with the help of 
two Gator errors and junior right-
hander Lauren Chastain was breezing 
through her outing until a pair of San 
Francisco State runs in the final frame 
tied the score. The Tritons were held 
to one base runner over their two 
extra innings and, in the bottom of the 
ninth, a Gator infield single knocked 
in the winning run. 

The doubleheader on April 26 saw 
the Triton bats finally come alive, but 
an uncharacteristically sloppy UCSD 
defense led to the team splitting the 
final two games of the series. In the 
morning game, Woofter showed that 
the previous day’s anemic offense 
was no longer acceptable, and in the 

game’s first at-bat she clubbed her 
sixth leadoff bat of the year. Later 
in the inning, senior third baseman 
Jenny Maze doubled in May to put the 
Tritons ahead up 2-0. The RBI was the 
120th in Maze’s UCSD career, making 
her the school’s all-time leader. 

Over the next six innings, UCSD’s 
infield would commit four errors 
leading to four unearned Gator runs 
and a 4-2 deficit. At the top of the 
seventh inning, the Tritons again 
scored a run to cut the lead to one 
but were unable to get that final 
clutch hit to tie the game as Woofter, 
representing the tying run, was again 
stranded at third. 

Facing the prospect of their second 
four-game sweep in the past three 
weeks, the Tritons put together a solid 
game and held on for a 7-5 win in 
the series finale. A first-inning Maze 
homerun spotted UCSD an early 
lead, and although San Francisco 
State would retake the lead 4-2, a fifth 
inning rally capped by May’s grand 
slam put the Tritons back up for good, 
giving them their only win of the 
weekend. The winning pitcher was 

senior Nicole Fullerton, who arguably 
threw her best outing of the season 
with 5.2 innings of two-hit relief. 

“Picking up that last game was 
really important,” Saari said. “Getting 
swept is the worst feeling ever, espe-
cially when we felt like we were the 
better team.”

The Tritons must now play the 
waiting game as they continue prac-
ticing at home while the top four 
CCAA teams battle it out for the 
conference title. In the week prior to 
the start of the NCAA West Regional, 
the selection committee will makes 
its seeding decisions, and UCSD can 
only bank on its hard work, both in 
and out of conference play, to earn 
them a chance to compete for the 
national championship.

“We have the next couple of days 
off then we’re going to have four or 
five intense practices in a row,” Saari 
said. “We need to work on hitting and 
build up our confidence again; we 
know we can do it.”

miscue for their second goal of the 
quarter, as Gstettenbauer converted on 
a five-meter penalty shot with 3:32 left 
to cut LMU’s lead to 4-3.

“We became more aggressive at the 
end of the game,” head coach Larry 
Sanders said. “If we had done that 
throughout the game, we would have 
had a better chance at winning.” 

The Lions pressed hard to keep the 
Tritons from completing a comeback, 
as their defense helped hold on to the 
one-point lead to send the Lions to their 
eighth straight WWPA Championship. 

“We’ve proven that we can play 
with anyone defensively,” Sanders said. 
“Offensively in this game, we only shot 

the ball 16 times — about half of our 
normal amount. We need to be more 
aggressive of offense and that’s some-
thing that we’re going to work on in the 
offseason.”

The Tritons were able to play in the 
semifinal against LMU because of their 
victory over Sonoma State University 
one day earlier. Playing their second 
game of the day, the Seawolves opened 
up the scoring with a goal in the first 
period. Gstettenbauer answered for the 
Tritons, tying the game up at 1-1 with 
1:37 left in the first period.

UCSD had a strong second quarter, 
building a 4-1 lead, but the Seawolves 
rallied back for a goal at the end of the 
half and another to open up the third 

quarter, cutting the lead to 4-3. 
Senior two-meter Judy Emaus 

added a score for the Tritons early in 
the third quarter to extend their lead to 
5-3. After Sonoma State University cut 
the lead to 5-4, the Tritons took control 
of the game with back-to-back scores 
that sealed the victory.

Gstettenbauer led the Tritons offen-
sively with four scores and Hockett 
protected the goal with 11 saves. 

“Sonoma State got a lot better 
throughout the season and we were 
able to shut them down and get ready 
to play against LMU,” Hermann said.

“The women look pretty safe with 

how they’re going to do, so we just 
want them to go out, respect the com-
petition and do everything they can 
to get ready for Nationals,” Salerno 
said.

The CCAA championship will be 
a three-day event starting on May 
1 hosted by Cal State Los Angeles. 
While many Tritons have already 
received automatic bids to the nation-
al championships, other athletes still 
can punch their ticket to the NCAA 

finals with strong performances dur-
ing the first round of postseason 
competition.

“The goal is the top three on the 
men’s side, which I think we can 
achieve,” Salerno said. “Historically, 
ours is the top conference in the 
nation. The women are just going 
to lay it out there to get their fourth 
straight conference title and get as 
many athletes to nationals as pos-
sible.”

Sloshball Semifinals End With 
G-Team to Meet Bros in Finals

After an impossible upset in their opening-round match-up with the powerhouse 
Marsupials, the G-Team members 
rolled through the semifinals into 
the tournament finals with a domi-
nant shitshowing, rolling to a 32-15 
win over a group of failures that 
couldn’t get into UCSD and now 
have to commute everywhere.

While the G-Team/Marsupial mar-
athon match came down to the wire, 
this contest was really no contest at 
all. It took a couple of innings before 
the G-Team sluggers got loose enough 
to start raking all over the diamond. 
After a few drinkoffs and stints at 
second base, the G-Team’s offense got 
started and never stopped.

It was approximately 7-7 after 
roughly two innings about midway 
through the keg when details begin 
to escape this reporter/participant, 
outside of the fact that the G-Team 
was dominating every aspect of the 
game, from drinking to defense. But 

a reliable source has reported that 
the G-Team went on to win by a 32-
16 final and that a good time was 
had by all, except perhaps Grizzly 
Adams.

With its second straight win, 
the G-Team moves on to the tour-
nament finale to face the heavily 
favored Bros squad in what prom-
ises to be the belligerent battle of the 
millennium.

work and determination throughout

TRACK & FIELD — Despite resting 
many of its top athletes in prepa-
ration for the upcoming California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
championships, UCSD had a very 
strong showing at the annual Triton 
Invitational, setting two national 
qualifying marks along with several 
personal records. The meet hosted 
some of the nation’s best athletes, 
drawing from both Division I schools 
and the professional circuit, with a 
handful of Olympic medalists com-
peting. With the regular season now 
completed, the Tritons head into the 
CCAA championships riding a huge 
wave of momentum after a 2008 cam-
paign that saw school records falling 
at almost every meet.

“I think it was a real good spring 
board for where we want to go now 
in the postseason,” men’s head coach 
Tony Salerno said. “We got to put a 
lot of people where we wanted to at 
the meet and get them some really 
quality competition. It really was one 
of the top meets in the U.S., so it 
was great to have the world in our 
house.”

Sophomore distance runner 
Brianna Schofield led the Tritons with 
her third-place finish of 4:33.61 in the 
women’s 1,500-meter dash. Schofield’s 
time met the national qualifying mark, 
earning her an automatic trip to the 
NCAA National Championships in 
late May. Finishing two places behind 
Schofield was senior distance runner 

Dianne Dunn, who ran the event in a 
time of 4:37.15. 

The 100-meter hurdles was by 
far UCSD’s winningest event of the 
day, with numerous athletes turn-
ing in fantastic times as the Tritons 
grabbed five out of the top 10 finishes. 
Sophomore hurdler Christine Merrill 
took fifth place with her time of 
14.52 while senior Kayliegh Knudson 
placed seventh with 14.61, a season 
and career best. 

On the men’s side, sophomore 
jumper Casey Ryan became the first 
member of the UCSD men’s team to 
hit an automatic national qualifying 
mark when he took first place with 
his leap of 6’10.75”, another season 
and career best. 

“[Ryan’s mark] is the first one 
we’re certain to have go to Nationals,” 
Salerno said. “Automatics are very 
rare, normally only the top people 
in the nation get that mark so it feels 
great and we’re real happy for Casey.”

While both Triton teams rested 
many of their athletes during the 
Triton Invitational, the men’s team 
especially chose to let some of its best 
performers tend to minor injuries in 
hopes that the two weeks off before 
the CCAA championships will allow 
them to return to top shape. 

“On the men’s side we’re trying 
to overcome some injuries and mak-
ing headway trying to get back to 
full strength at conference,” Salerno 
said. “In sifting through the marks 
it’s always overwhelming when you 
look at the quality of the competition. 
When you see our people down 15th 
or 20th on the list it’s a bit shocking, 
but it’s more a testament to how good 
the athletes at the meet were.”

In the most recent power rankings 
put out by the United States Track 
& Field and Cross Country Coaches 
Association, the UCSD women’s 
team once again retained its perch

WATER POLO — Hopes of winning 
the Western Water Polo Association 
Championship were alive for the No. 
16 Tritons until the final seconds of 
their contest against No. 12 Loyola 
Marymount University in the WWPA 
Semifinal game on April 26. The 
Tritons fought from a 4-1 deficit in 
the fourth quarter only to fall one goal 
short in a 4-3 loss to the Lions after 
they advanced to the semifinals with an 
8-6 win over Sonoma State University 
on April 25. After the tough loss, the 
Tritons bounced back to take third 
place in the tournament by beating 
Santa Clara University 8-7 with a tie-
breaking goal in the game’s final second 
on April 27 to end their season.

UCSD’s defense was tough against 
LMU, as the Tritons played the Lions 
for the second time in the last two 
weeks. While the matchup on April 12 
resulted in a 9-7 win by the Tritons, this 
game featured fewer goals and many 
more defensive stops from both teams.

“We didn’t have the offense going 
for us this game that we had two weeks 
ago,” senior utility Nicole Hermann 
said. “We didn’t take as many shots 
so we didn’t have as many offensive 
opportunities.”

The Lions started off the scoring 
early on in the first period, slipping 
a shot past senior goalkeeper Kim 
Hockett for the first score of the game. 
The rest of the quarter went by scoreless 
as each team’s defense took control. 

UCSD got on the board with 5:35 
left in the second period when senior 
attacker Elizabeth Hahn scored for the 
Tritons to tie the game at one. The

SOFTBALL — In their final regular 
season series, the Tritons played four 
close games with the San Francisco 
State Gators, but ended up dropping 
three out of the four in the series. None 
of the games were decided by more 
than two runs, with UCSD losing the 
opening three games 2-1, 2-1 and 4-3 
before coming from behind to win 7-5 
in the series finale. The nail-biter losses 
give the Tritons a final regular season 
record of 32-22 but a losing conference 
record of 15-17.

“Playing in all those close games 
really puts the pressure on you and 
we’re going to have to step up more in 
those situations in the playoffs,” sopho-
more catcher Nicole Saari said. “It was 
definitely heartbreaking to go into extra 
innings in those games and come away 
with a loss. San Francisco is a scrappy, 
aggressive team and they found a way 
to get runs; we didn’t really string hits 
together and kind of just gave it away.”

The weekend pushed the Tritons 
out of contention for the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association cham-
pionship but not out of the NCAA 
tournament. The CCAA’s top four 
teams — Humboldt State, Cal State 
Stanislaus, Cal State San Bernardino 
and Cal State Monterey Bay — will 
now compete for the title and an auto-
matic bid into the NCAA Regionals. 
Although the Tritons’ sub-.500 confer-
ence record takes them out of the run-
ning for a conference title, their out-
standing overall record almost assures 
them an at-large bid from the NCAA 
selection committee. 

The Tritons, who are currently 
ranked second in the West Region, 
are confident that their absence from 
the CCAA tournament won’t impact 
their ability to regain some momentum 
and still do well in the regionals and 
beyond.

“We are still confident for the play-
offs; we know that no matter what 
team we face we can beat them,” Saari 
said. “All the teams that we might play 
at regionals, we have played before and 
have done well against throughout the 
season. It would have been nice to go 
into the postseason on a winning streak 
but now we just have to make some 
minor tweaks and go from there.”

In game one on April 25, senior 
lefthander Melissa Ward threw a two-
hitter but the Tritons ultimately fell 2-1. 
Ward struck out 10 Gators but gave up 
a two-run, fifth-inning homerun to 
San Francisco State’s Kelsey Wood that 
proved to be the deciding run. 

UCSD was unable to get much 
done on offense until the final inning, 
when a two-out rally nearly forced 
extra innings. With two down, senior 
outfielder Randelle Bundy reached on 
an error and freshman shortstop Sarah 
Woofter knocked a double to center-
field, putting runners on second and 
third. Junior outfielder Megan Grace’s 
infield single scored Bundy from third 
and moved Woofter within 60 feet 
of tying the game. Junior outfielder 

Lions added another goal before the 
break to take a 2-1 lead into halftime.

Down only one score, the Tritons 
had a good chance to tie up the 
game with their defense shutting out 
the Lions for the entire third period. 
Unfortunately, UCSD’s offense contin-

ued to struggle against LMU’s defense 
and the third period went by scoreless. 

The Tritons did not begin the final 
period well, quickly seeing their one-
goal deficit turn into a three-goal hole 
after the Lions scored twice in the first 
two minutes of the fourth quarter. With 

six minutes left, UCSD’s offense finally 
showed up as junior attacker Sydney 
Gstettenbauer scored a 6-on-5 goal 
with 5:55 left in regulation. The Tritons 
took advantage of another defensive
