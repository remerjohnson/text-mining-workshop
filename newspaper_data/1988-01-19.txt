Part of last Saturday's parade in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. ran down Market Street, whose 
name was changed from the name of the former civil rights leader to its present name in the last 
election.

ous Third College students. UCSD's entries 
were near the end of the parade route. 

UCSD was among the many community 
organization . high school band , busines es. 
and individuals to participate in last Saturday' 
parade through downtown San Diego held in 
honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Floats, bands, antique cars, notable person-
alities, and drill teams all converged on 21 st 
and J Streets awaiting the start of the parade. 

The day wa as perfect a day for a parade as 
could be expected in January. The sun was out 
and the air crisp; clouds rolled in a the parade 
wound down Market Street, which was the 
object of heated controversy last year when San 
Diego voters elected to rescind, the decision to 
change the thoroughfare's name from Martin 
Luther King Way back to Market Street. 

Some participants had to wait longer than 
other ; among them were Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Dr. Joseph Watson, 
Jan Sternbach, Assistant Resident Dean for

A few people along the parade route 
expressed their dissatisfaction with this action 
by wearing shirts that read "Shame on You, 
San Diego." 

The prevalent atmosphere of the parade, 
however, was festive. To many participants and 
onlookers, the parade was not only a celebra-
tion of Dr. King's birthday, but also a celebra-
tion of the victories won by civil rights activists

Medical Center begins study 
of early amniocentesis 
By CHRIS HAMSON 
Stll/f Writer 

An ongoing study at UCSD 
Medical Center which will in-
volve 1,000 women is testing the 
safety of early amniocentesis. 

Amniocentesis is a surgical 
procedure in which a hollow 
needle is inserted through the 
abdominal wall into the uterus 
of a pregnant woman. Amniotic 
fluid is then withdrawn through 
the needle and analyzed to deter-
mine the presence of disease or 
genetic defects. 

Cells in the amniotic fluid are 
cu ltured on a tissue culture 
medium to enable detailed 
chromosomal analysis. 

• Gary Hart 

The study, according to Tom . 
Key, Director of Perinatal Med-
icine, will also test the ability to 
extract amniotic fluid this early 
in pregnancy. Another subject of 
study is the ability of the labora-
tory to get cells for tissue culture 
medium and return results 
promptly. 

Early amniocentesis is being 
performed as early as the tenth 
week of pregnancy with results 
available in the twelfth or thir-
teenth week of pregnancy. Nor-
mally, amniocentesis is per-
formed in the second trimester of 
pregnancy around the sixteen to 
the eighteenth week with re ults 
available three weeks later. 

For the study, which began in 

early December, women are 
randomly assigned to either early 
or sta ndard amniocentesis 
groups. 

"Large numbers of women are 
needed to evaluate the risk of 
this procedure," Key said . "For 
second semester amniocentesis 
the miscarriage rate is only about 
I in 700 or 800. We wouldn't be 
able to determine the safety of 
this procedure with only 100 
women." Thus far there have 
been no adver e incidents . 

"Early amniocentesis gives as 
accurate chromosome informa-
tion as a later procedure," said 
Cathy Boyle, a genetic counselor 
with Medical Genetics.

UCSD ranked 
fifth in federal 
R&D funding 
By CHRIS HAMSON 
Staff Writer 

UCSD is ranked fifth in the 
nation in federal funding for 

' research and development , ac-
cording to the National Science 
Foundation. 

The latest figures how that 
UCSD received $133 .2 million 
for research and development 
from 15 agencies for fiscal year 
1985-86. 

The four school which re-
ceived more money than UCSD 
are: Johns Hopkin Uni ersity, 
$445.7 million; Mas achu ett In-
stitute of Technology, $188.1 mil-
lion; Stanford U niver ity, $180.2 
million; and the Univer ity of 
Wa hington, $146.7 million . 

In fiscal year 19 4-85 UCS D 
was ranked 13th in federal money 
received for research and 
development. 

"The increase in federal fund-
ing is due to faculty growth and 

our chool' great reputation for 
quality re earch," said Richard 
Attiyeh, dean of the Office of 
Graduate Studie and Research . 

UC Dial 0 ranked 10th in 
the nation , up from 12th, in total 
research and development ex-
penditure with $161 million 
being spent on research and de-
velopment in fiscal 1986. 

The nine schools which out-
pent UCSD are: Johns Hop-

kins, $440.8; M .LT, $257.7 mil-
lion; University of Wi consin . 
$231 million; Cornell , $225.4 
million; Stanford , $223 .1 million; 
University of Minnesota, $201.7 
million; University of Michigan, 
$187.8 million; University of 
Washington, $186.5 million ; and 

CLA, $/68. 1 million . 
UCSD was funded by 15 dif-

ferent federal agencies, from the 
National In titute of Health to 
the Department of Energy.

Welfare commission 
rejects subminimum 
wage proposal 
By ELAINE SMOLER 
Staff Writer 

The California Industrial 
Welfare Commis ion (IWC) 
unanimously voted over the win-
ter break to reject its original 
proposal to allow employers to 
pay full-time students under the 
age of twenty-one 85 percent of 
the newly set minimum wage of 
$4.25 an hour, 

The IWC's original proposal 
from last September included 
provisions to increase the min-
imum wage from $3.35 an hour 
to $4.00 an hour. Also, they 
recommended a lower minimum 
wage for full-time college stu-
dents and for employees, in 
general, who receive tips total-
ling more than $60 a month. 

Although the IWC voted to 
change the provision for students, 
they voted to keep the provision 
for tip-receivers as well as raise 
the recommended minimum 
wage to $4.25 an hour. 

The University of California 
Students Association (UCSA), 
in coordination with the Cali-

fornia State Student Organiza-
tion and other parties, responded 
to the proposal by expressing 
students' opinions during IWC 
hearings, submitting letters and 
petitions, and speaking with 
legislators. 

Groups which recommended 
the sub-minimum wage, like the 
California Hotel / Motel Associ-
ation, presented their case by 
explaining that it is beneficial to 
students. They believe that a 
lower wage for students would 
provide an incentive for employ-
ers to hire more students as the 
minimum wage rises. 

According to a press release 
from the UCSA, "The pTimary 
rationale for the proposal was 
that students do not need the 
money they earn for necessities, 
but use it instead for luxuries 
and frivolities." 

Also in the press release from 
the UCSA. "Employers who tes-
tified before the IWC attempted 
to perpetuate the image of the 
tudent as an inferior worker

Noted SIO researcher 
Abe Fleminger dies 

Dr. Abraham Fleminger, a research-
er in MLRG inee 1960, died Wed-
nesday, Jan . 13, of peritonitis . Flemin-
ger was one of the world's most highly 
regarded authorities on copepods, the 
abundant planktonic animals common-
ly know as "insects of the sea ." He 
pioneered in the use of ultrastructural 
characteristics of co pepods in order to 
establish evolutionary lineages. 

Hi publications include 
descriptions of many new species , 
emphasizing the zoogeography of 
species groups intertwined with 
analysis of ecological events relating to 
their evolution. His di covery that sex 
change can take place in certain 
copepods when the environment 
changes prompted rethinking by the 
population of biology of this field . 

There will be a memorial service at 
SIO at some future date. Joy 
Fleminger asks that donations be 
made to SIO or to the charity of one's 
choice in her husband 's name .

lfTTfHSlfTTfRSlfTTfRSlfTTfRSlfTTfRSlfTTfHSlfTTfRSlfTTH Gary Hart's return 
to the rat race 

Responsible recycling 
possible for everyone 
Editor: 

The UCSD Recycle Coopera-
tive would like to thank Matt 
Mac Arthur for his opinion ar-
ticle, "Toxics: waste not, want 
not" (11 / 23). The attention that 
he has given to these problems is 
valuable in raising the environ-
mental awareness of the UCSD 
student body. We would like to 
point out . however, that there 
are several critical hortcomings 
in his report that need to be 
addressed and corrected. 

Mr. Mac Arthur wrote that 
"things that the regular citizen 
can do now are severly limited ." 
We find that statement very frus-
trating because all of us in the 
co-op have worked very hard to 
do just the opposite. If he had 
looked more closely around this 
campus. he would find that for 
the "regular citizen," there are 
many opportunities to recycle 
the ir aluminum cans, glass bot-
tles , newspapers , and computer 
paper (everyone at one time has 
used them) . A campus map de-
tailing where these places are is 
located on a wall in the student 
center next to the ride board . 
For those people who are a bit 
more concerned and committed , 
there are student organizations, 
such as the Recycle Co-op, that 
deal everyday with the issues of 
waste management , toxics waste . 
urban growth , air poll utio n, and 
conservation . For example, our 
group has sponsored campus 
events, such as envi l J lllnental 
lectures, wildl ife displays , and 
petition signature drives. We a re 
al 0 actively involved in outside 
en viro nm e ntal o rgani zat io ns 
such as the San Diego Council 
for Envi ronmental Organiza-
tions (which includes the Sierra 
Club, Environmental Health Co-
alition, Audubon Society, etc.). 
In short . the opportunities are 
there, for both the mainstream 
student , and the dedicated en-
vironmentalist , to do something. 

Certainly we share M r. Mac 
Arthur's feelings that present re-
cycling efforts are "not good 

enough." But is it enough to stop 
right there? Our major problem 
is a shortage in human power, 
people that can help us to expand 
our collection services so that we 
can reach and educate more stu-
dents . By not mentioning our 
services and our needs, he has 
almost defeated the whole pur-
pose of his article, which was to 
educate , inform, and guide stu-
dents to the means . 

Can UCSD "breed" an en-
vironmentally aware citizen, a 
Mr. Mac Arthur had asked? 
From our experience, the poten-
tial is there. but this must be 
qualified . Future projects, such 
as a curbside recycling program 
for all campus dorms, would 
educate students tremendously. 
Students would carry this experi-
ence with them into their latter 
professional lives, making them 
more receptive to recycling pro-
grams that may be considered in 
their future cities . A great idea, 
but such a project would require 
tremendous student and univer-
sity involvement and cooperation 
- in short , a formidable task . 
We also live in a university 
campus that is highly decentral-
ized, making it very difficult for 
us to advertise and inform. So at 
best, the prospects are mixed , 
and we can only try to do more. 

By writing this letter, we are 
point ing out to other students 
that there are ways on this 
ca mpus of dealing with all the 
iss ues that M r. Mac Arthur ha s 
ra ised . We a re very pleased with 
the attenti o n a nd spir it that Mr. 
Mac Arthur has given to these 
issues, and we hope that in the 
fu ture. M r. Mac Arthur and the 
Guardian will cont inue to cover 
environmental issues.

hope you take it no more and no 
less seriously than any of the 
others . 

Plainly, I feel that your paper 
plays to a small audience and, in 
doing so, fails to seek-out news 
that interests all of your readers. 
Foregoing boring political angles 
crying out 'injustice' or 'parttal-

tisfaction with the thoroughness 
of your paper. There are a lot of 
people at UCSD, each with a 
story, and I think the Guardian 
should fill us in . 

Especially at such a big place , 
there is need and interest for this 
kind of journalism. The going -
on of a less considered 'organiza-
tion would be just as interesting 
as "The Adventures of the Cool 
and Savvy Political Adversary" 
or "Woes of the Student Go-

the valiant journalists who give 
kind press to the deserving? Per-
sonally, I'm tired of having to 
talk to people every time I feel 
like being nosey - I want a 
paper that does that for me.

after its public trouncing. 

Hart's reentry into the world of politics has greatly divided 
support for the Democratic party. Can the Democrats no-
minate a winning candidate with Hart back in the race? Before 
Hart's return, Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis were the 
front-runners for the Democratic nomination; now Hart has 
jumped to the top of the polls with Jackson and Dukakis not 
too far behind . 

At the Democratic national convention, the party represen-
tatives will have to decide which man can put his party back in 
the White House. Hart has made this decision difficult by 
splitting the peoples' support. 

How has Hart, from his fallen status. regained leadership in 
the race? Name recognition has been a big factor as have his 
many "new" ideas. Hart has taken a stand on all of the issues

that he might put into practice if

would greatly help his campaign

by debts for many years. For the 
most part , Hart has entered the 
race to boost his own ego. 

By returning to the presiden-

is only doing this for himself and 
not for the good of the party

A.S. Council suspends bylaw to vote funds 
By ELAINE SMOLER 
Staff W,it(!, 

The A.S. Council voted last 
Wednesday night to suspend a 
financial bylaw after an animated 
five-minute recess interrupting 
an otherwise routine meeting. 

The council debated the allo-
cation of$307.40 for T-shirts for 
the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee (SAAC) Outreach. 
Councilmembers go to high 
schools in the San Diego area to 
encourage students to consider 
college. 

Under the financial bylaws, 
money can't be allocated for

"Results for both early and 
sta ndard procedures are being 
returned in the same time frame," 
Boyle said . "We have a three-
week average." 

In testing for one indicator of 
fetal abnormality, alpha-fetal 
protein, the resea rchers lack a 
basis for comparison since 
alpha-fetal protein levels change 
throughout pregnancy, making 
comparison with the alpha-fetal 
prot,ein level determined later in 
pregnancy meaningless. 

Alpha-fetal protein is an indi-
cator of abnormalities in the 
spine and central nervous system. 

The practice of performing 
amniocentesis around the 

"uniforms or club apparel." The 
A.S. Council can vote, however, 
under another bylaw to suspend 
a financial bylaw. 

At first, the council voted down 
the motion because they didn't 
want to suspend the bylaw, even 
though there was a general con-
sens us that money for the T-
shirts was a worthy allotment. 
Brett Franklin, who motioned 
the vote, then called a recess. 
When the council reconvened, 
they took another vote, only this 
time they voted to suspend the 
bylaw, and voted to allocate the 
money.

sixteenth week of pregnancy 
began in the early 1970's because 
in the seco nd trimester of preg-
nancy there are enough cells in 
the amniotic fluid to culture. 
Now, according to Boyle, with 
new ultrasonic technology to 
locate the smaller volumc of 
amniotic fluid present earlier in 
pregnancy and a better medium 
to grow the fewer cells, early 
amniocentesis is feasible. 

Boyle envisions that the ear-
lier amniocentesi process will 
become standard . 

Amniocentesis usually is 
recommended for women who 
have a family history of genetic 
disease or for those over age 35. 
since at this age the risk of hav-
ing a baby with a genetic defect 
exceeds the ri k of pregnancy 
loss from the procedure. [QJ 

ca n now choose to either sign the 
bill or veto it. "I will probably 
sign it and attach a leiter explain-
ing my reservations," he said in . 
an interview. 

"If we could have passed it 
[the allocation] without sus-
pending the financial bylaws, 
then the council's actions could 
be challenged later in front of the 
judical board," explained Eric 
Chazankin, parliamentarian for 
the council.

Continued from pale 8 
protest. 

King, describing his own 
method of nonviolent resistance, 
said, "it does not seek to defeat 
or humiliate the opponent, but 
to win his friendship and under-
standing." For King, whether 
good friend or bitter opponent, 
every person has an element of 
God within him - or herself. 

Before his death, King had 
received one of the greatest 
awards of human accomplish-
ment - the Nobel Peace Prize. 
It is the words spoken by King as 
he accepted this prize that we 
should remember and from 
which learn, as today marks a 
time of honor for a man of peace.

the next four years, I wanted to

Maher said . 

The A.S . Council also voted 
to allocate $440 for Glo Lights 
for Assorted Vinyl and Soft 
Reserves. An original proposal 
was for two Alpha Electronic 
Message Centers, which would 
cost $730 more. The Alpha Elec-
tronic Message Centers are elec-
tronic signs with red lights that 
spell out sentences. The Glo 
Lights might be likened to 
chalkboards with f10urescent 
writing.

salads. no sour cream or mayonaise in our guacamole. no taco sauces or factory made 
taco shells. no fajitas. no black olives. cheddar cheese and other so called "Mexican 
food" in our recipes. 

Besides the usual tacos. burritos. enchiladas etc. that we make the truly Mexican 
way. our menu features among others. specialties such as (bkken in a spicy mole 
saute. tender breaded steaks. tasty came ilHda bllaplquenil. delicious beef 
tongue vera<:ruz style. potato and (beese paWe5. (beese-filled lu((hinls.

A SChOOI holiday makes for an extra day of skiing, surfing. tudying, or often 
j ust plain relaxation . It is impor-
ta nt . however, to look back at 
the purpo e of the holiday, Ie I 
we forget the significance and 
magnitude of a person's cont ri-
bution . Today marks the ob-
erved birlhday of Martin Luther 

King, Jr. (his real one is Jan. 15), 
and is a time to remember and 
learn from one of Ihe greatest 
civil rights activists of our time. 

In 1955, a seamstress named 
Rosa Parks got on a bus in 
Montgomery, Alabama . As she 
at down in the front of the bus, 

the driver told her to give up her 
seat for a white man . Instead of 

{ 

relinquising her seat, she ada-
mantly chose to remain seated 
and was then ta ken to jail by 
police, in accordance with Ala-
bama state law. 

It was this incident which 
brought attention of the ac-
cruing inju tice to blacks to the 
public a nd sparked King to lead 
the famous Montgomery bus 
boycott. For 382 days , blacks 
walked or shared rides to work, 
hoping to bring about social and 
legal changes through King's 
principle of nonviolence. Vio-
lence became evident in 1956, 
when the U.S. Supreme Court 
declared bus segregation, in 
Montgomery and el ewhere, il-
legal. 

Although the Court ruled 
egregated buses illegal, many 

southern states refused to 
comply with the new law. King 
then organized an integrated 
group of protestors, called Free-
dom Riders , to merely ride on 
buses throughout the South. 
After they left the Alabama bus 
stop, the first group of Freedom 
Riders was bombed and then left 
stranded with their bus et on 
fire . 

Many nonviolent protestors 
were violently beaten, often while 
waiting at the bus stops. The 
vic tims included both black and 
white protestors alike. Because 
the viole nce and hatred was so 
prevalent, King called for federal 

support . With the help of At-
torney General Robert F. Ken-
nedy the Freedom Riders had 
federal escorts of highway patrol 
cars. U.S. national guardsmen, 
and sometimes even Army re-
connai sance planes. 

Peaceful change was not an 
easy task . Confronted with fire-
bombs thrown a t his home, hate 
mail , and threatening phone 
calls , King learned to deflect 
personal hatred in order to strive 
toward racial equali tv. The self 
sacrifice required to achieve this 
was evident in King's more than 
20 jail terms, which were often 
based on such charges as "loiter-
ing," or "speeding . .. 

King's ultimate sacrifice was, 
of course, on April4, 1968 . As he 
stood on his Memphis hOlel's 
balcony, an assassin ' bullet 
entered the minister's head . 
Marlin Luther King, J r. was 
pronounced dead one hour later. 

It was the principle of change 
through nonviolent means which 
helped make the doctor of theo-
logy so famous . It is an idea 
which stemmed from one of 
King's great influence, Mohan-
das K. Gandhi . Gandhi, who 
helped end the oppressive" Pass 
Laws" of South Africa , is best 
known for his role in leading 
India to it independence from 
Britain . Gandhi only advocated 
peaceful, yet defiant. methods of

By KA TV SMITH 
Stuff Writt, 

One of America's favorite pet 
peeves is the fact that we can put 
a man on the moon bUI we can't 
cure the common cold . Mo t of 
us have not gone one academic 
year without getting a cold, and 
the season for the cold is upon us 
once again . Here are a few help-
ful hints on avoiding, or getting 
rid of. the common cold . 
What is a cold? 

A cold. besides being a nui-
sance, is an upper respiratory 
infection caused by a virus . There 
are at lea t 200 different cold 
viruses, and these viruses con-
stantly change, or mutate Due 
to the high mutation rate, science, 
and the human body, is always a 
few steps behind, making it 
impossible to find a cure for the 
common cold . 
What are the symptoms of the 
common cold? 

The cold viruses invade the 
throat and nasal passages. leav-
ing its victims feeling like they 
just got run over by a "semi." 
The usual symptoms include a 
congested head, stuffy or "runny" 
nose, slight sore throat, mild 
cough, sneezing, possibly a low 

fever. and a feeling of malaise. 
How do you get a cold? 

This time Mom was wrong, 
you can actually go frolicking 
naked in the rain on a wintery 
day and not catch a cold! Co ld s 
are spread most often by the 
hands and airborne viruses 
caused by coughing and sneez-
ing. Kissing someone with a cold 
is a good way to get one yourself. 
but, if you really want a cold, I 
suggest rubbing some of the virus 
into your eyes or nose. The nose 
passages and the cyes have 

proven to be much more ensi-
tive to the cold virus than the 
mouth, so keep your hands clean 
and out of your nose and eyes! 

Now that you'n lot a cold, how 
do you let rid of it? 

Because there is no cure for 
the common cold , it is, more or 
less, necessary to let your body 
fight it off on its own . Rest is 
very important because the body 
needs all the energy it can get to 
combat the cold ~ If you have a 

fever, drink at least eight glasses 
of water every day. To soothe a 
sore throat . or cough . drink 
plenty of warm liquids (like 
broth and teas) . Salt water gar-
gles are also very helpful for a 
sore throat (one teaspoon of salt 
to eight ounces of water). Eating 
and, more importantly, eating 
nutritiOUSly are al 0 important 
in combatting a cold. 

Over-the-counter drugs are 
wonderful ways to relieve your 
symptoms, but they do not cure 
it or decrease the duration of 

your cold. Many cold medica-
tions contain aspirin , caffeine 
and l or alcohol, all of which can 
speed up the heart rate and cause 
a temporary increase in blood 
pressure . Combination cold 
medications often contain many 
unnecessary ingred ients, some of 
which actually work against each 
other. 

Over-the-counter medications 
(OTCs) also have contra-
indications and / or side effects, 
making it very important to read 

How do you avoid a cold?

friend has a cold. the best thing 
to do is arm yourself with a large

Speaker critiques U.S.-Mexico relations 
By ADAM LEVY 
Sttl/J Writer 

While the coverage of Latin 
America in the last five years has 
been dominated by news de-
picting the continual struggle be-
tween Nicaragua and the Rea-
gan Administration, crisis has 
also been brewing in the neigh-
boring land of Mexico. 

Cathryn Thorup, a member of 
the Overseas Development Coun-
cil and visiting fellow at UCSD's 
Center of U.S.-Mexican Rela-
tions, addressed the proble m of 
U.S. weaknesse in dealing with 
Mexico in her seminar last Wed-
nesday. 

She claimed that the key pro-
blem in the U.S.'s dealings with 
Mexico is a lack of a coherent 
policy. According to Thoru p, 

the United States needs to set 
"clear policy guidelines." As of 
present , she said , the country's 
relationship is of an "erratic 
nature" in which governmental 
agencies pursue their own agen-
das, sometimes contradicting one 
another. This , then, creates con-
fusion for the Mexican govern-
ment. 

In discussing what the Mexico-
U.S. relationship should be like, 
she emphasized the need to view 
Mexico with a stronger urgency 
than the United States does other 
Latin American countries and 
not to do so for the sole reason 
that Mexico has oil. The U. S. 
economy, she aid, is strongly 
intermeshed with the Mexican 
economy. "No other country has 
the potential to affect the United 
States [so ] negatively or positively."

Thorup exemplified the point 
when she spoke of how economic 
troubles in Mexico cost the 
United States 200,000 jobs. 

Thorup suggested that the 
United States needs a permanent 
governmental position or office 
that deals specifically and soley 
with Mexico, possibly located in 
Congress or the White House. 
Such an office would be re-
sponsible for coordinating and 
articulating a consistent policy 
towards Mexico. She also point-
ed out the importance of strong 
presidential leadership with clear 
policy aims backing such an 
office. 

Professor Wayne Cornelius, 
head of the Center for U .S.-
Mexican Studies and specialist 
in Mexican politics, in a response 
to the seminar, further empha-

sized the need for strong leader-
ship. "It will be essential to have 
strong presidential leadership 
. . .. to insure that Mexico re-
ceives consistently high priority 
attention in the next administra-
tion. 

Another key problem, Thorup 
noted , is the lack of expertise by 
U.S. governmental officials in 
dealing with Mexico. She said 
that a lack of knowledge in 
Mexican politics and history 
greatly inhibits enlightened pol-
icy-making by Washington offi-
cials . It was pointed out that 
even the U.S. embassy in Mexico 
lacks the expertise that it should 
have. 

Thorup's seminar, adapted 
from her recent writings, were in 
response to a request from the 
Bilateral Commission on U.S./ 

Mexican relations to come up 
with ideas that would facilitate 
the U.S . government in enacting 
the commission's policy recom-
mendations. It is extremely im-
portant, said Professor Peter 
Smith. head of the commission, 
to find a relationship with 
Mexico that will "minimize un-
necessary conflict" and "manage 
necessary conflict." 

The Center for U.S.-Mexican 
Studies, located at the Institute 
of Americas, will be having 
seminars on Mexico every Wed-
nesday this quarter from 3-5 pm. 
Next week's seminar is entitled 
"The Second Wave: Develop-
mental Implications of New 
Forms of Maquiladora Invest -
ment in Mexico," by Richard 
Sinkinand Randolph R. Marks.

Tritons tops Menlo 
with free throws 

UCSD uses fouls and ejections 
against Menlo to win 110-85 

By BRIAN now 
taff Writer 

Attempts to revive the UCSD 
football program were boosted 

aturday night at the Triton 
Pavillion . Fans were treated to a 
glimp e of the future as a foot-
ball game broke out of the bas-
ketball contest between Menlo 
College and UCSD. And in 
between they were able to see the 
Tritons "escape" with a 110-85 
victory. 

the game, leading by nine points. 
They were dominating both end 
of the court. Offensivel , they 
could not be stopped as they 
con istently sank their hot . 
Defensively, they were able to 
keep the Tritons fro m ever pos-
ing a threat to their lead. At that 
poin t, it looked a though they 
would coast to an easy victory. 

With six minutes remaining in 
the first half, UCSD's Nick 
Capuano and Menlo's Ken Welsh 
became invo lved in an alterca-
tion that erupted into a bench-
clearing brawl. Everyone on the 
Menlo team and one player from 
UCSD left the bench . It then 
took the referees J 0 minutes to 
restore order ' and resume the 
game. 

However, after the techn icals 
were shot, UCSD held a 10-
point lead and the momentum 
had shifted . For the next three 
minutes, the Triton held their 
op ponent scoreless as they 
extended their lead to 17 points. 
At the half they led by 12 points, 
56-44. 

ral Risko/ Guardian 
Flat. to fr •• throwa: Because of th is brawl between UCSO's N ick Capuano and Menlo'S Ken 
Welsh (center), Rob Rittgers was g iven and sank 24 straight free throws on techn ical fouls , giving the 
Tritons a 40-30 lead. 

When order was finally res-
tored, 14 technical fouls had been 
assessed - 12 to Menlo College 
and two to UCS D. Capuano, 
Welsh and Menlo Coach Bob 
Williams were ejected. Under a 
new CAA rule, any player leav-
ing their bench during a fight i 
assessed a two-shot technical 
foul. Thus Menlo was awarded 
four free shots and UCSD 
twenty-four. After Menlo guard 
Bill Campanella made three of 
four technical shots to give his 
team a 30-16 lead , UCSD's Rob 
Rittgers proceeded to bury all 24 
of his free throws and suddenly 
gave his team a 10-point advan-
tage, 40-30 . 

Prior to the incident, Menlo 
College seemed well in control of 

Triton Coach Tom Marshall 
commented on the turnaround , 
" I don't think after the incident 
that they could have done any-
thing. And, to be frank, as a 
coach, I was hoping that we 
could take advantage of that 
because I knew that after half-
time they would be 0 emotion-
ally charged that they would 
have regained t heir composure 
and been fired up and ready to 
play. I didn't know if we could 
with tand that ... " 

As it turned out, the Tritons 
only need to play good basket-
ball for ten more minutes. After 
that , Menlo hdd completely lost 
its composure, They were as-
essed two more technical fouls 

and guard Sabre Bowden was 
thrown out of the game. UCSD 
was able to ca pitalize on the 
course of event and open up a 
28-point lead. From that point, 
they were able to coast to an easy

three NCAA Division 11\ free-
throw records. 

The records were set with the 
help of 12 technica l fouls called 
against Menlo when a brawl 
broke out between the two teams. 

Point-guard Rob Rittgers was 
called upon to shoot the free 
throws for the Tritons and sank 
all 24. Rittgers finished 30 of 30 
from the line, breaking the pre-
vious record of 19 in a row, set in 

I "IS' by K.evlO Brown of Emory 
& Henry College. The 30 free 
throws in the game also s urpassed 
the 26 shot by Joe Robe rts ofSt. 
Andrew's College in 1975. 

The Tritons set the third record 
as team, si nking 53 free throws 
out of 59 attempts for the game, 
breaking the previous record of 
45 free throw attem pts, set by 
Washington & Jefferson College 
in 1982 and tied by CCNY in 
1983. Records for the most con-
sec uti ve free throws by a team 
are not kept .

Athlete of the Month

••••••• 

Carol Lipson 
Women's Volleyball 
Setter 
Senior, Warren 
History Major 
Pacific Palisades. CA 

Carol Lipson's collegiate volleyball car~r came to an end in November. But the 
final match was one Carol and her teammates will never forget. as they defeated 
Elmhurst COllege for the Triton's second consecutive NCM Division III National 
Championship. 

Carol left quite a mark on the UCSD program during her four years as a Triton. 
She was a member of thr~ national championship teams. earning NCAA AII-
Tournament honors in each of the three years. She was selected to the AII-
American Team in both 1986 and 1987, and this year was selected the NCM 
DMson I II Player of the Year by VOlleyball Monthly magazine. She was also voted by 
her teammates as the UCSD Most Valuable Player. 

Coach Doug Dannevik says "Without question, Carol was the leader of our 
Championship team. Her contribution day in and day out, through every practice 
and every match. was unparalleled by any member of the team. Carol sacrificed a 
lot by moving from hitter to setter in her senior year. It might have even cost her an 
All-American nomination. But she made the switch because the team needed her 
to, and that's the very definition of being a 'team' player." 

Lipson enters the UC San Diego record books as one of the all-time leaders in 
hitting. attaCking, blocking and serving. She WIll long be remembered as one of the 
premier players who made UCSD the national power that it has become. 

Also nominated for November's Athlete of the Month were Peter Pak in Men's 
Fencing, and Kevin Stewart in Men's Basketball.

Fight 
Conlinued rrOin pale 12 
110-85 victory. 

After the incide nt, UCSD was 
a ble to play disciplined baske-
ball and take ad vantage of the 
lead that had been handed to 
them. " I feel good for our guys," 
said Marshall , " because they 
showed some savvy and they 
came out and played hard . I have 
real mixed feelings right now_ I 
feel really good for our players 
but I don't like to see fights 
influencing the ball game. I like 
to see a good game where both 
teams play hard and the better 
team comes out the winner. 
Tonight the incident had a great 
deal t o do with the outcome." 

Almost lost in the shuffle was 
Rob Rittgers' game-high 33 
points - 30 of which came from 
free throws. In the game, Rittgers 
set a new school record by hit-
ting 30 free throws in a row and 
tied another with 30 in one game. 

Marshall was happy about the 
accomplishment and said , "that 
was anamazingfeat. Just because 
you get 30 free throws doesn't 
mean you're going to make 30." 

Rittgers felt the free throws 
may have been the turning point 
in the game. "The free throws 
turned the game around . Their 
whole team came out onto the 
court to break up the fight and 
they paid for it. It may have cost 
them the game. As far as the 
record goes, I'mjust happy I had 
t he opportunity to break it. 
There are a couple other guys on 
the team who could have done it 
just as easily." 

Mars hall summari zed the 
game by sa ying, "Sometimes it's 
better to be lucky than good . 
And tonight we were lucky." rm
