Defense Attorney for the 
University of California 
Oavid Nye has filed a 
demurrer in a case involving 
a former UCSB Facilities 
Maintenance (PM) worker 
who sued the system over his 
dismissaJ. In the statement, 
Nye a1leaes insufficient 
evidence to warrant a trial 
and asserts that former UCSB 
PM worker Christopher 
Browne has not exhausted all 
administrative remedies 
within the university. Browne 
filed a lawsuit in November 
alleging he was fired in 
retaliation for efforts to bring 
the PM Department into

Staff, Administration Examine Racism 
DISCRIMINAnON: Brenda Roy, formerly an ad-ministrative nurse with the UCSD 

Medical Center, said discrimina-

initiated a personal investigation 
in 1992. What she claims to have 
found: over 200 people with simi-
lar tales of race discrimination.

Many members of minorities 
on the UCSD staff are still running 
into walls of racial discrimination, 
and when they do, complicated 
grievance procedures fail to resolve 
problems, some employees say. 

While administrators acknowl-
edge that there are some problems, 
they say the university is hacking 
away at discrimination and stream-
lining grievance procedures in re-
sponse to an affirmative action re-
pOrt released in April, 1993. 

According to Roy, the situation 
hasn't gotten much better since a 
Special Task Force on Affirma-
tive Action created by Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson reported the 
need for improvement in affirma-
tive action last April. A group 
founded in October to support 
minorities claiming discrimination

By AleX ..... TIIIeMn St." Writer 

Rekindling a debate that be,an Fall Quar-
ter, former C~ Caf~ member Jim Stephens 
spoke to the Associated Students' Council 
about his allegations that the co-operative 
violated univenity policies. 

Stephens, a non-affiliate, inquired about 
the propelS of the A.S:s quarterly audit of 
the ChI Caf'. 

Lut Fall, Stephens made public aDe,a-
tions that members of the ChI violated the 
Memorandum of Undentandin, (MOU), an

Top Brass 
To Receive 
Merit Pay 
Increases 
SALARY: Regents approve 
raises for UC administrators; 
employee union, student leaders 
criticize board's decision' 
By Dan Kr ..... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Salary increases for University of Calif or-
nia administrators were approved by the Board 
of Regents in closed session at last week's 
meeting in San Francisco. The raises, which 
averaged two percent, were part of the 
university's m~rit program for all UC em-
ployees earning under $12S,OOO a year. 

All employees are eligible for the increases, 
which are awarded only after a review pro-
cess. According to university spokesman Mike 
Alva, the merit raises are part of an incentive 
program intended "to reward outstanding per-
formance" of university staff. 

The salary increases approved by the re-
lents on Friday are for a select group of 
employees designated as "Officers of the 
Regents." For most UC employees, merit 
raises are approved by the chancellor of the 
individual campus or, in the case of central 
administrators, by the UC president. 

The regents also approved "equity adjust-
ment" raises for four adrninistratPrs who have 
taken on additional work in the wake of elimi-
nated posidons. Two employees, whose sala-
rica excee;d the $ 125,000 limit for merit elili-
bility, will receive equit adjustments of about 
seven percent. 

AccOrding to Alva, the equity adjustments 
are completely different from the merit raises.

sibili~ increased ... (tue to [employee] reor-

Candlelight Vi II Will 
Protest Fee Hikes 
RALLY: Tonight's event, sponsored by the A.S. 
External Office, comes in wake of regents' meeting 
By Karen Chene 
Senior Sta" Writer 

In an effon to protest the Uni-
versity of California undergradu-
ate and graduate fee hikes ap-
proved by the Board of Regents 
last week. the Associated Students 
will hold a candlelight vigil to-
night at 10:30 p.m. at the Price 
Center. 

The rally is 
scheduled to fall 
between the last 
two showings of 
Dal ed and Con-
fused at the Price 
Center theatre in 
hopes of boosting 
attendance. 

Headed by A.S. 

dents to address the fee increase. 
Other effons will include the 
launching of a statewide UC Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) cam-
paign and pushing for a one per-
cent augmentation in the federal 
budget for education, as well as 
asking for a $62 million al!ocation 
from Gov. Pete Wilson. The cam-

paign will empha-
size leHer writing 
and telephoning. 

According to 
. M c C los key, 
UCSD students 
have been very 
complacent about 
fee hikes in the 
past, which illus-
trates the general 
apathy of the cam-
pus as a whole. 

External and Cam-
pus Office Direc-
tor Jenner 
McCloskey. the 
purpose of the vigil 
is to mobilize stu-
dents and other 
members of the 
UCSD community 
and allow them to 
vent their frustra-
tions about the re-
cent fee hikes . 
McCloskey pre-
dicted a high turn-
out for the eveD!. 

" It should be a 
very well-auen&d 
vigil, especially af-
terthedireclassaulr 
of the regents at the 
face pf UC stu-
dents." McCloskey 
said. 

"I'v ..... n

apathy is the great-
est enemy of the 
people. It's a very 
important concept 
because one of the 
most ironic things 
is that the people I 
see give energy to 
the word are the 
very people who 
hate it the most," 
she said. 

McCloskey 
added that the 
people who need 
to be mobilized are 
the people who 
want to do some-
thina but can't. 
"It's not the people 
who don't care, 
but the people who 
care so much but

Campus Office Director thing. We have

$2,000 increase for ftrSt-year stu-
dents at UC professional schools. 
In addition, the regents adopted a 
long term fee policy which could 
mean fee hikes of $600 over the 
next several years, according to 
some projections. 

"I've been talking to people 
who are frustrated beyond belief. 
Thursday will be the final day of 

• mourning [for the students]. From 
that point, we will decide on what 
to act upon - students have been 
the silent majority forfar too long," 
McCloskey said. 

"We have no say in decisions, 
no say in how our money gets 
spent," she added. 

McCloskey said that the vigil 
itself is only the begining of a 
number of efforts planned by stu-

long as we take the 
initiative to do it." McCloskey 
said. 

Citing slogans such as "When 
the force of logic fails, then the 
logic of force is the only alter-
native," written on the ground 
at Revelle Plaza and then washed 
away by the rain. McCloskey 
believes that students are "actu-
ally starting to wake up a little 
bit. " 

According to McCloskey. the 
vigil is only the first step in a long 
series of effons to voice student 
rights. 

"How long do we have to take 
to persuade California to stan in-
vesting in our future? We have the 
potential to do anything. We just 
have to decide what we want and 
do it." McCloskey said.

Milk Does. Body Good, UCSD 
Medical I ........ Conclude 

Women between the .. of 20 and 50 who drink 
two or more cups of coffee per day are at hl&her risk 
for osteoporosis than female coffee drinkers who also 
drink milk dally, according to researchers at the UCSD 
School of Medicine. 

In a report published In the Jan. 26 Issue of the 
Joumal of the AmerIcan Medical AssocIation (JAMA), 
UCSD researchers studied the lifetime dietary habits 
of 980 post-menopausa/ white women aces 50 to 98 
years. 

The researchers found that those women who 
drank two or more cups of coffee per day and drank at 
least one &lass of milk dally had bone rntneral density 
6.5 percent hlCher than reau'- coffee drinkers who 
did not drink milk . 

Lower bone minerai density (osteoporosis) in-
creases a woman's risk for bone fractures. This Is the 
first study to look at the long-term effects of coffee 
drinking In relation to dietary calcium and bone mineral 
density. 

"I think the take-home messece for women Is that 
If you are &Dina to drink more thin two cups of coffee 
a day. you should also be sure to coneume enough 
calcium to restore your balance. " said ElIzabeth Barratt-
Connor. M.D., prlnclpallnvestlptor of the study 

"One way to do this Is to drink milk dally." Barrett-
Connor added.

UC Exposed Patients to Radiation 
EXPERIMENT: UC 
officials investigate 
charges that researchers

By PhIlp .-chillI

SAN FRANCISCO - Stung 
by media reports that some people 
were exposed to radioactive mate-
rial without their knowledge as 
pan of a World War n-eragovem-
mental research project at the Uni-
versity of California, UC officials 
have begun investigatinl the 
university's role in the experi-
ments. 

At last week' s meeting of the 
Board of Regents, UC San Fran-
cisco Chancellor Joseph B. Mar-
tin outlined the university's re-
view mechanisms for research 
experiments and discussed allega-
tions that university researchers 
participated in .-.diation experi-

Martin said. 

A review board has been set up 
at UCSF to investigate media re-

nine of the II records have been 
located by UCSF investigaton. 

Three of the patients received 
injections of plutonium while at 
the University of California hos-
pital in San Francisco. Seven other 
patients received dosea of stron-
tium. 

Martin called the research 
"egregious examples of ways that 
medical research should not be 
carried out. 

'1t was outrqeou& to have done 
these things to patients without 
their informed consent," hudded. 

According to Martin, the ex-
periments were prinwily con-

and fiscally irresponsible," said 
President of the University Pr0-
fessional and Technical Employ-
ees Union Libby Sayre, referrinl 
to the pay cuts and fee increases 
being impoecd by the university. 

However, Alva maintains that 
last year's 3.S percent pay cut af-
fected all UC employees, inchld-
ing those eligible for merit salary 
increases, and that criticisms of 
over--compcnsation for hiaher-
level executives are unfounded. 

several decides alo of leukemia. 
"If there are any thinlS we can 

learn from this that will protect 
human beings in the future, then 
certainly we ought to recognize 
that," Manin said. 

Martin also discussed the 
university'S guidelines for con-
ducting research with human sub-
jects. Each campus monitors its 
own research activities to ensure 
that UC regulations are followed. 

UC President Jack Peltason 
called on the nine UC chancellors 
and the three directors of the labo-
ratoriCi which the university man-
ages for the U.S. Department of 
Energy to determine if any such 
studies were conducted by UC 
personnel at the campuses or labo-
ratories . 

Since the experiments took 
place in the 1940sandearly 19505, 
it is believed that most informa-
tion relevant to the experiments 
will be related to UCSF, UC Ber-
keley, the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory and the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory. 

Nick Endres called the merit in-
creases absurd. "It shows a real 
disregard for students within the 
university. There seems to be 
this obsession that quality is 
linked with high salaries," Endres 
said. 

Vice Chancellor of Business 
Affairs Steven Relyea was the only 
UCSD administrator to receive a 
merit raise. His salary will increase 
S.S percent, from $118,500 to 
$125.000.

"The phrase 'we'd like to take 
over the 016 Caf6' is very insult-
ing," said A.S. President Carla 
Tesalt. "What you guys do or how 
nway you feed is interesting, it's 
an iDterestinl convenation piece, 
but it has nothinl to do with the 
A.S. 

"The space leased to the Ch6 
Caf6 is legally leased forthe lenJlh 
of one year ... [and] right DOW the 
space isn't theA.S.'s to do with." 
Tesalt added. 

A.S. Advisor Randy Woodard 
also reminded Stephens thai there 

is no guarantee that Food For 
Thought would be able to obtain 
the space if the Ch6 were to be 
evicted. 

But Food For Thought Secre-
tary Jan Engdahl said that the real 
issue she and Stephens came to 
address was overlooked by the 
council. 

''I1Ic issue is us as citizens of 
California wanting to know what 
is going on in a public instirution. 
Because this is a public university 
we should be able to know if laws 
are beinl broken," Engdahl said.

When Push C_. to Shove, 
The UC Rege.1ts Choked 

The evil that men do lives after them; the sood is oft interred with 
their bones. So it shall be for the University of California Board of 
Regents. At last week's monthly meeting of the regents jn San 
Francisco, the board approved a long-tenn fee policy remarkable only 
for its short-sightedness. 

Trumpeted by UC President Jack Peltason as the only surefire way 
to maintain the quality of the university, the long-term fee policy calls 
for students to pay an Educational Fee, which will be assessed to cover 
the costs of instruction. How much win this fee be from year to year? 
Nobody knows exactly. The fee rate will be detenninedby the amount 
the Board of Regents believes students should pony up to "maintain 
the quality of instruction." a rather nebulous aiteria at best In essence, 
the long-term fee policy allows the Office of the President and the 
Baud of Regents to raise fees without any sort of OOIL'Itraint - iees 
could be raised to pay for whatever harebrained scheme administra-
tors come up with. all in the name of preserving quality. 

1be plan makes some halfhearted attempts to keep the cost of the 
university affordable through financial aid - or at least it purports to. 
In reality, the Affordability Model approved by the Board of Regents 
offers no finn guuantee that students will be able to pay for their 
education without miring themselves inextricably in a quagmire of 
debt. If the money's there, then students will be able 10 pay their fees. 
And ifnot-well, that's not really the regents' problem. "If the price 
begins to look too high for the students, then they won't come," said 
UC Provost Walter Massey. "The students will go elsewhere." 

At the crux of the matter is the regents' goal of preserving the 
university's place as one of the nation's top institutions, certainly a 
noble aim. Last week. the regents also gave salary increases to 
compensate for last yeu's pay cuts to faculty and staff, approved merit 
increases for administrators and faculty and passed other measures 
designed to retain the UC's first-rate employees. What the regents fail 
to see, however, is that the University of California can have the best 
faculty, the most state-of-the-art facilities and the most qualified 
personnel in the world. But it won't matter if students keep dropping 
out of the university like soldiers in the Bataan death march. The 
University of California is nothing without its students, and right now, 
students seem to be running last on the regents' list of priorities. 

The truly sad thing aboutlast week's vote is that it didn't even have 
10 take place. Student Regent Darby Morrisroe had urged the board to 
postpone its vote because she thought the proposed fee policy was 
based on inaccurate financial aid data and that a better policy could be 
proposed. Just delay the vote a month. she asked, until the university 
can come up with something better. 

For reasons that defy logic, the regents ignored Morrisroe's 
arguments and decided that they had to pass a new feepolicy right then 
and there. Wby they did so is anybody's guess. No one was holding 
a gun to the regents' collective head. Whether the regents voted on the 
policy in January or whether they opted to wait a month wouldn't have 
mattered mIlCh - except for the possibility that a semi-decent fee 
policy could have been developed instead of the dreck that was 
approved. 

The regents had a cbance to adopt a policy that would have boldly 
addressed the challenges of the future. Instead. they muffed their 
opportunity. Years from now, when people look back on this vote, 
they won't remember the regents' admirable intention of preserving 
quality. They will remember that when push came to shove, the Board 
of Regents let the university doWn. 

Students Connect with 
Community School Children 

h the walls crwnble all uound us - war, drive-bys, drugs, fee 
hikes, AS. idiocy - it's always nice to find something, however 
small, on the positive side of thin~. At UCSD, Partners At Learning 
(PAL) is doing its share to make things a little' better in communities

IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE 
COMMENTARY: Government radiation experiments exposed many to unknown 
dangers. Documents should be declassified so these horrors can be investigated 
By DcMCIM Alex"'" 
Opinion Editor 

Throughout the post-World Wu II era, the U.S. gov-
ernment conducted a wide variety of "dlssified" radia-
tion experiments on American citizals. Prisoners, the 
elderly, mentally retarded individuals, soldicn, Native 
Americans, hospital patients, women and the general 
public were exposed to high levels of radiation during 
experiments often with lialc or no knowledge of the 
health risks. 

These experiments were conducted 
by several govcmmenl agencies, in-
cluding the Department of Energy 
(DOE), the Pentagon, the Central Intel-
ligenceAgency(CIA), NASA, the Pub-
lic Health Service, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the 
Veteran 's Adminilllation as put of the

In the late '50s, contaminated material from a Nevada 

test site was buried in Antan.:tica to determine the effect of 
nuclear fallout on the environment. The public was not 
warned of the contaminated area. Though denied by the 
pemmeot, these tests arc believed kJ be linked kJ abnor-

co. 'NTAIIY: As the world's ethnic and religious oonflicts continue, the African nation of Namibia proves racial coexistence is possible

REYnOLDS 
WORLD 

VIEW 

We often foc:us 
10 tighdyon thedh-
Ric CXIIIfticls of the 
world - in South

and the former S0-
viet Union - that

rican nation of 

Namibia. In the short time since independence, 
the people of Namibia have shown that forgi~ 
ness and a belief in democratic principles can 
overcome even the very worst racial divides 
within a society. 

Namibia, formerly known IS South West 
Africa, was colonizrd by Germany in the 18805 
and remained a German territory until it was 
seized by South Africa during World Wu I. In 
the 192(k, the occupation of Namibia was effec-
tively legitimized by the League of Nations, 
giving South Africa protectorate staIus over the 
country. 

In 1966, the South West African People's 
Orgariization (SWAP(}), a sister movemenI to 
the African National Congress (ANq in South 
Africa, launched a bloody guerrilla war, ulti-
mately leading 10 Namibia's libention. But it 
was not until 1971 that the International Court of 
Justice declaml South Africa's occupation ille-
gal and not until 1978 that the United Nations 
passed n:solution 435,ablueprint for Namibia's 
independenoe. However, South Africa did not

comes from the diamond mines - the largest 
sector of employment and contributor 10 the tax

recent awomplishments have 
gone unnoticed, overshad-
owed by conflicts and changes 
in South Mrica and the world. 
But for our people, the quest 
for peace, stability and a new 
order has persisted. Emerging 
from a legacy of war and in-
justice, Namibia's ability to 
avert major crises in these for-
mative months is perhaps one 

But how did Namibia manage to salvage 
peace and stability from the wreckage of such a 
bloody racial conflict? Namibia is a unique case. 
Only 1.5 million people live in a country twice 
the size of Texas, making it one of the most 
sparsely populated in the world. As Prime Min-
ister HageGeingod said, "We don 't have 10 fight 
overland because there is enough to go around." 
Further, whites make up only five percent ofthe 
population, while in South Mrica they comprise 
15 percent The rest of the populous is domi-
nated by one ethnic group, the Ovambo.

expected and it was later exposed that the South 
African regime had covertly given white oppo-
sition parties $35 million to aid their campaign 
against the bbcration movement. Despite the 
illegality of this action, the opposition's 30 
assembly seats pve it an effective role in draft-
ing a new oonstitution. 

Surprisingly, the rauiting constitution was 
quickly hailed as one of the most democratic in 
the world. It induded minority righIs, propor-
tional representation in parliament, Iiee speech 
and a bill ofrighls. Dick Mudgc(theopposition's 
leader) reassured conservatives that "there is 
white life after black liberation. .. the govern-
ment is abiding by the constitution and is dearly 
committed to multi-party democracy." 

Many have credited this surprising confi-
dence in thegovernment to the deft touch of Sam 
Nujoma, Namibian President and SWAPO 
lcader. On the first anniversary of his country's 
independence, Nujoma said, "Our new parlia-

of the most important achievements of our inde-
pendence." Nujoma, the former Marxist libera-
tion leader, surprised many by including whites 
in his first cabinet and of speaking of racial 
harmony and capitalist economic growth. 

MorefundamentaHy, blacks and whitesseem 
10 have made a "pact" of reconciliation. Some 
SWAPO leaders point to the dangers of the 
ANC coming to power in South Africa without 
having participated in a full-scale liberation 
war. Tijitendero, the speaker of the assembly, 
has said that South Mricans fighting for libera-
tion "never got it out of their system. We did, 
which is why we were ready to hand over our 
guns when we came back from exile. "However, 
much of the credit goes to Nujoma's govern-
ment. It has backed away from the usual path of 
the one-party African dictatorship and has in-
stead instigated and defended democratic prin-
ciples at every tum. 

Of course. there ~ still major obstacles for 
Namibia to surmount The country's unemploy-
ment rate is close to 40 percent and with the 
current decline in world copper, lead and zinc 
prices, its raw material exports have failed to 
alleviate the high levels of poverty. Over 70 
percent ofNamibians depend on agriculture in a 
land dominated by deserts. In 1992, a severe 
drought crushed subsistence farmers, pushing 
them from rural areas to the few towns and 
cities, where employment is already scarce. 

In August of last year, Geingob told 71re 
Washington Post, "if you are in an African 
country that isn't in the news, you must be doing 
something right." As true as this may be, it is 
only right that we applaud one of ihe few suc-
cesses in a world increasingly fragmented by 
racial distrust and hatred. 

The economy remains flat, but many 
Namibians are hopeful that a change in the 
South Mrian government and greater interna-
tional investment will provide the impetus to 
their floundering economy. One ray of hope

COMMENTARY MISREPRESENTS CHRIST 
EdItor: 

I have sympathy willi DuicI J. 
Hurst's attempt in his JIft. 2001 com-
mcntIIy, "DcooaIrudiIlg avist, .. to 
find meaning in the penon and tad!-
ing of Cluist. However, his observa-
tions about the Romlft Catholic 
Church's IppIOKh to biblical inter-
pretation IJId dogmItic development 
are errooeous at their wont IJId shal-
low and fanciful at their bat. A Roo 
sponse is in order 10 such 1ft irrespon-
sible (do not laid "offerBive'") piece. 

Some raderswill mnsider Hurst's 
opinions of Ouisaianity, partiarlarly 
Catholicism, Jcsitimate. But they are 
not even amateur. That is, they fail to 
oohere inlfty evident way and rely on 
misstated fads. For example, isn't the 
long life of McthuscIha almost 1ft 
idiom? Not here - he ooofusc:s the 
character with Mek:hizidck. Read the 
book, Dan. But 10 rebut his article 
point by point would elevate it be-
yond its merits. I nstcad, I take issue 
largcly with his method. 

Despite a heavy usage, explicidy 
and implicitly, of authorities, there 
are no supporting quotations, except 
one from alate David Wojnarowicz: 
"J'here weren't any tape recorders 
around and people misquoted Jesus 
wildly." I yield the first point, but in 
the context of his article, the quote 
makes no sense. Regarding the sec· 
ond point, Mr. Wojnarowicz, who-
ever he is, must know something we 
do not. 

Indeed, Mr, Hurst seems IS if he is 
not being quite forthright, regardless 
of the "tremendous amount of em0-
tional honesty" in his article. He would 
have us believe that his synthetic vi· 
sion ofOrisl's message is one culled 
from his straight lading of the fads. 
On the contrary, in this article <ltrist 
is simply a vehicle for Mr. Hurst's 
sentimentality. He invokes atheists in 
theabstract,politicaUycomctonesor 
otherwise, IJId either discredilS them 
or is at a loss with what 10 do with 
them. It certainly leaves a residue, a 
bitter aftertaste, in the reader's mind. 

Hurst's article is a collage of im-
pressions. It is guided by 1ft aesthetic 
or, it would be fair to say , hecomcsoff 
IS an aesthete. Dan would like thernca 
of stories 10 "malter" because they 
can be printed in italics. F..mphasis is 
enough. He "likes o.rist's unadulter-
ated message" perhaps in the same 
way he likes his favorite flavor of ice 
aeun. "If all of us loved our neigh-
bor ... this place might look a bit bet-
ter." We should love our neighbor, 
just because. 

I say, when people abandon Truth, 
they do not obtain a greater freedom, 
they simply shift aJJcsiancca. Living 
then devolvca into 1ft oconomy of 
appcuanccs. In this reapect, Daniel 
might be right in saying thinp mighl 
"look" bdter,forthat lalvatige is all 
one could hope for.

ChrlstlMIty 
EdItor: 

As a Catholic, I believe that Daniel 
J. Hurst has grossly rnisrqJresentcd 
my faith. I n spite of his insistence that 
themes and morals outweigh details, 
he himself combines ignorancc of the 
fundamental themes of Ouistianity 
with a hazy knowledge of a few es0-
teric details. This confusion is shown 
in miniature by his reawk that it 
doesn't matter whether MoseslJld the 
Israelites wandered in the Sahara 
Desert, when in fact he wandered in 
Ibe Sinai Desert, between Egypt and 
1srIeI. Mr. Hurstdocsn'tseern Iolmow 
where Moses came from or where he 
was going, only that he might not 
have wllldcm1 for 40 years. 

Much worse is his idea that it 
doesn't matter whether or not Jesus 
existed. This showa he ... misaed the

CustOlll.r Relations 
EdItor: 

A recent survey taken by Student 
Center Servica showed that pecip1e 
are very happy with the way they are 
treated when shopping at the Food 
0HJp, ranking us number one in the 
category of "arstomer relations. " 

I am the individual whom Mat-
thew Shugart claima treated him in a 
shockingly u-Jcnt manner (Jan. 24, 
"Readers' Forum"). We at the Food 
Co-op are relieved that Mr. Shugart 
wiD no Ionserbe a fellowcustomer at 
the Food Co-op collective. He has 
repeatedly treatcd members of the 
w-op in an impatient and disrespect-
ful manner. Members other than 
myself have experienced his bilter 
attitude. 

A basic tcoct of the philosophy 
behind the Food Co-op is to treat 
people with respect. Unlike a typical 
retail store that follows the Golden 
Rule of Customer Relations (i.e. "the 
customer is always right"), the Food 
Co-op runs on a more participatory 
basis where members and customers 
interact criticaUy with one another 10 
determine the workings of the store. 
Our commitment 10 the voice of cus-
tomers probably explains why cus-
tomers are so satisfied with our ser-
vices. But this aitical relationship 
demands mutual respcd and when 
Mr. Shugart treatcd me disrespect-
fully, I si"y returned the favor. 

Based on his past interactions, it 
seems IS though Mr. Shugart is look-
ing for a medium of social exchange 
in which he can get away with treating 
people poorly. The Food Co-op is not 
the pIacc. Does Mr. Shugart think that 
just bec:auIe he is a aIItomer he is

Thunday, January 27,1994 The UCSD Cuardian 

Riverside Junior Named Student Regent 
APPOINTMENT: 
UCSD student Guevara 

. passed over by regents 
ByJonn.P ....... 
Associate News Editor 

For the first time since the p0-
sition was created in 19,75, a stu-
dent from UC Riverside has been 
recommended by the selection 
committee for the position of 20th 
student regent. 
, Junior Terrence Wooten, a bi-
ology major at UCR, will replace 
this year's Student Regent. Darby 
Morrisoe, if the full board approves 
him at its Feb. 17 meeting in San 
Francisco. 

Wooten is currently the vice 
president of external affairs for 
the UC Student Association 
(UCSA), an organization that rep-
resents UC student interests to the 
Board of Regents. He has also 
served as campus coordinator for 
the UCSA and as director of state 
affairs for the Associated Students 
of UC Riverside.

has heard a number of complaints, 
said Roy. an informal organizer of 
the group. "Since we started on 
Oct. 10, it's been the same old 
story," said Roy, referring to the 
lack of progress. 

According to Delia Talamantez. 
director of Staff Affirmative Ac-
tion at UCSD, things have gotten 
better over the last year and will 
continue to improve. "I think 
people are more aware [of dis-
crimination] as a result of the 
Special Task Force.", she said. 

As an example of the 
university's increased interest in 
diversity. Talamantez pointed to 
work force figures released this 
month by the Staff Affirmative 
Action Office. In the Management 
and Professional category, the 
number of minorities increased 
from 12 percent of the total in 
1992 to 17 percent in 1993. 

Of 8,157 staff members (not 
including faculty) at UCSD, 2,814 
were African American. Hispanic, 
Asian or American Indian in 1993. 

held at UCR last March]," said 
UCSA field representative Donny 
Emerick. 

Emerick added that he has had 
the opportunity to work with 
Wooten and has only positive 
things to say about him, "He's a 
very strong student leader." 
Emerick said. 

Wooten was chosen from 
among 43 applicants representing 
each of the nine UC campuses 
after a long selection process that 
began last fall . The Associated 
Students of each campus inter-
viewed the applicants who made it 
through the first cut of the written 
applications. 

Four candidates apiece from 
northern and southern California 
were then sent to the UCSA meet-
ing held !it UCSD in early January, 
After interviewing prospecti ve stu-
dent regents and debating for 
hours, the UCSA selected three 
finalists to send to the Board of 
Regents selection committee. 

In addition to Wooten, the 
UCSA selected UC Davis student 
Patrick Mispagel and Warren Col-
lege senior Pancho Guevara as its 
finalists. 

The regent committee, chaired 

according to the' Affirmative Ac-
tion figures. The number of mi-
norities in upper-level positions 
has been gradually increasing since 
1987. but the largest percentage of 
minorities - 40 percent - re-
mains in the lowest-level positions. 

A large part of Talamantez's 
program to decrease discrimina-
tion involves the education of su-
pervisors and employees on 
multicultural issues. ''The fact is 
that the demographics [at UCSD] 
are changing, and unless everyone 

byRegentJacquesS. Yeager, con-
ducted a final interview with each 
of the students and recommended 
Wooten to the full board. 

Wooten is expected to receive 
complete approval from the full 
board next month, 

Emerick said the UCSA is very 
happy that Wooten will be able to 
represent his fellow students on a 
higher level. 

"We were looking for a student 
that would best convey 
'studentness;' someone who knew 
what it was like to be a student," 
Emerick said. 

In his application for Student 
Regent. Wooten said he hoped to 
bring such qualities to the Board 
of Regents, 

"During this time of rising fees 
and loan increases, rising hate 
crimes against students of color, I 
could bring to the board the in-
sight of an average college student 
struggljng financially to stay in 
the university and get a degree," 
Wooten said. 

"My experience as a very ac-
tive and diverse college student is 
a key aspect that should be con-
tributed to the Board of Regents," 
Wooten added. 

does understand each other, it's 
going to be very difficult working 
together." Talamantez said, 

While Talamantez said there 
were discrimination problems be-
fore the report was released last 
year, she added that support for 
affirmative action programs has 
increased dramatically since then. 
"Until [the report], we were not

Survey Analyzes Parking. Conditions, Safety at Warren 
By ROMtte FIemInI 
Guanl/an Reporter 

In an effort to shed light on 
where UCSD's Transportation 
Committee should focus its ef-
forts concerning parking at War-
ren College, the Associated Stu-
dents conducted a parking survey 
there last week. 

Through the surv~ the A.S. 
will assess whether a loading zone 
for students who park after mid-
night is needed, if students at War-
ren need more parking spaces and if 
the shuttle system should run after 
midnight for those students who use 
it to commute from Warren to the 
center of campus. 

The A.S. hopes to alleviate the 
immediate problem of overcrowd-
ing at the Warren lots, as well as 
improving safety conditions in the 
lot after dark. In the long run, the 
survey will help the A.S. and the 
Transportation Committee decide 
whether to introduce a nwket-
based approach to parking at 
UCSD. 

Of the 1,200 surveys placed in 
each of the Warren College mail-
boxes, I ~9 were returned. Seventy-
two percent of the respondents said 
that they went to their c.ars most 
ofton at night. When they couldn't 
find space in the parking lot by 
Warren College, 49 percent said 

that they parked in the East Pamng 
Lot across Interstate-~. The survey 
also found that S2 percent of the 
respondents felt safe walking to or 
from their cars after dark. 

When asked if a campus shuttle 
should run to the East Parking Lot 
after midnight, 60 percent said yes. 

According to A.S. President 
Carla Tesak, the survey confirmed 
the A.S.'s concern that many stu-
dents do not have convenient 
places to park between the hours 
of9 p.m. and midnight. 

The A.S. will take this data and 
present it to the Transportation 
Policy Committee to support a 
proposal for a shuttle that will run 

from the East Pamng Lot to War-
ren. This new shuttle will start 
after the campus loop shuttle stops 
running each night in order to en-
sure that no students will have to 
walk to Warren alone after mid-
night, Tesak said. 

In addition to safety concerns, 
the survey has helped to bring at-
tention to the lack of an adequate 
number of pamng spaces at War-
ren College. At present there are 
1,200 undergraduate students liv-
ing at Warren, but only 18~ park-
ing spaces. 

According to Warren College 
Resident Dean Claire L. Palmer, 
students need "to give the powers 

that be.the information they need. 
Students don't realize the power 
they have." 

With 61 percent of the students 
unable to park by the residence 
halls, theovercrowdcd pdina sibl-
ation has become a major concern 
for the A.S. "Students are defi-
nitely on the lowest rung of the 
hierarchy on Campus," Tesak said. 

Tesak intends to use the survey 
to promote the A.S.'s current ideas 
fora market-based pamng program 
which would give Sbidents the 0p-
tion of buying a parking spot closer 
to campus. A version of this option 
will appear as a referendum in this 
spring's A.S. elections.

• State and federal laws also 
strengthen the administration's de-
sire to confront racism. 

"Grievance procedures and 
oversight are so lax and poorly 
coordinated, it allows department 
personnel officers to do whatever 
they want," said an Asian-Ameri-

"The organization's willing-

there are statutory protections," 
said Rogers Davis, assistant vice 
chancellor of Human Resources.

Minority staff members and 
former staffers like Roy, however, 
s!id they have yet to see any sub-
stantial improvement. Roy, who 
was among the Med Center nurses 
initially prompting the Special 
Task Force's formation afterstrik-
ing in 1992, said some of the same 

The employee said that person-
nel officers at the departmental 
level make decisions and give ad-
vice to staff members without fully 
informing them of options. Many 
don't even know they have op-
tions beyond accepting the per-
sonnel officers' decisions, the 
employee added. 

A recurring complaint, voiced 

PoIItIoII 

again by the anonymous employee, 
involves the 30-day deadline to 
file a grievance. Many employees 
don't find out that they can file 
until the deadline has passed, the 
employee said. 

However, Davis said that em-
ployees have many options to deal 
with complaints. "I think UCSD 
has a sound infrastructure for em-
ployee relations. Employees have 
a number of avenues to take issues 
of concern," he said.

Talamantez said employees 
have a chance to resol ve problems 
on the informal level, that fonnal 
grievances can be filed within the 
university, and when all avenues 
are exhausted, grievances may be 
filed with external agencies. 

In addition, according to 
Talamantez, departments dealing 
with staff complaints are trying to 
better coordinate their efforts. A 
lack of coordination was a major 
complaint of some staff members.

Roy, though, said she is not con-

place. She said the same discrimi-
nation -lack of promotion, threats 
to switch employees to different 
departments, forced retirement -
that she faced while at UCSD still 
exists. "11us is the '90s, and we're 
not going to keep quiet and allow 
this. to go on," Roy said. "We 
shouldn't even have to wony about 
this. We're not asking for anything 
we're not qualified for."

H atus Editor 

ince his arrival at UCSD, Literature Pro-
fessor Quincy Troupe bas lured a number 
of nationally recognized artists to San 
Diego for readings and performances. 
Last year, he brought African-American 

writer Toni Morrison (who has won the Nobel Prize 
since her appearance here) and Jamaican poet Derek 
Walcott to UCSD. He also organized a series called 
.. Artists on the Cutting Edge: Cross Fertilizations" 
at the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown 
La Jolla that featured intriguing combinations of 
prominent poets, musicians and critics. 

This year, Troupe is again curating the program. 
.. Artists on the Cutting Edge II: Cross Fertiliza-
tions" will kick off its second season tonight with a 
reading by Margaret Atwood, Ishmael Reed and 
Lynn Luria-Sukenic:k. During a recent interview, 
Troupe talked about his aesthetics, the multicultural 

nature of the program and his role in the commu-
nity. Troupe said he didn't intend to make a sequel 
when he put "Cross Fertilizations" together last 
year. 

"What happened was that it was so successful 
and people liked it so much - the artists liked it, 
and it impacted the community in a way that 
nothing else in literature had impacted this com-
munity - that the museum wanted to do it again," 
Troupe said. 

The title "Cross Fertilizations" does n.ot only 
refer to the fact that diverse artists perform to-
gether. Troupe explained that it also describes the 
diverse audiences the readings draw . 

"For me, cross fertilizations has more to do with 
the audience than it does with the artists," he said.

For Troupe, an African-Ameri-
can poet who is the author of nine 
books and the co-author with Miles 
Davis of Miles: 1M A Ulobiogra-
pity, his efforts to provide multi-
cultural activities for the San Di-
ego community are part of what he 
considers a larger need forthecoun-
try to come to terms with its diver-
sity. Troupe sees art as a way of 
helping people understand differ-
ent cultures and alleviating the fear 
and misunderstanding that often 
mar relationships between differ-
ent races. 

"Ibe United States bas to come 
to the realization that this is a multi-
cultural country, and you have to 
have everyone participating and 
respecting one another," he said. 
"White people often don't under-
stand the fear African Americans 
have for whites because we were 
lynched and the police attack us, 
but what we want to do is try to 
alleviate that fear and that's what 
art can do. 

"Take a piece of art, a Picasso 
painting ... or a poetlikeJoy Harjo, 
who is a Native American poet or 
John Ashbery who is a white, male, 
American poet-.:. you get human-
ized by theeneounter.1 see the arts 

as a humaaizina beauty, and I think 
it's a wonderful mediu. throuah 
which we can commuaicate with 
one anolher. Sometimes it's COD-
frontational, but that's okay. Ute 
cannot be lived without confront-
ing thinp." 

The series is unique because 
Troupe often places artists who 
work in different mediums with 
one another. Some of the readinp 
will pair writers with musicians. 
Alto saxophonist Steve Coleman 
will perform with poet Jimmy 
Santiago 8aca and writer Jayne 
Cortez on Feb. 3; guitarist Phil 
Upchurch will perfonn with Troupe 
and beat poet Allen Ginsberg on 
Feb. 17; alto saxophonist Chuck 
McPherson will perfonn with poet 
Jessica Hagedorn and. novelist Os-
car Hijuelos on Feb. 24. Troupe 
said he tries to challenge artists 
with these unique pairings. 

"I like to put people together 
who are different. 1 like to come up 
with odd combinations," he said. 
"Last year, I put Toni Morrison 
together with Max Roach, a drum-
mer. When you put people together 
in odd combinations like that, it 
makes them go beyond themselves. 
It upa the ante a little bit. When you 
put an artist toptber with someone 
they don't know, it puts them on 
edp. You want tbat edge to it. 

"I put together an all-female 
night with Joy Harjo, Ntozake 
Shanp and Anne Waldman [on 
Feb. to]. They are all superb poets. 
One ia a Native American. one is a 
Jewish woman and one is Mrican 
American. All three are very fa-
mous and very dynamic. To put 
them together will cause some ten-
sion. They might be trying to outdo 
each other. I think in a multicultural 
way. I think, 'who can I put in this 
thing who will be fantastic?' I'm 
always looking for tbose combina-
tions that can enrich a life." 

Although he has read with 
Ginsberg before, Troupe said he 
doesn't know what will happen 
when they perfonn together in Feb-
ruary. 

"I read with Allen Ginsberg and 
Amy Tan in New York for freedom 
of speech in 1990. I don't know 
what to Cltpect. We have a guitar 
player with us, but we'll see when 

Tbunda" J .. ...., 27.1993 

we .. t there. I think that mak .. it 
intereatinaand mak.everyone feel 
a little telllion. Allen ia a greal 
reader thoup." 

Ginsberg's popularity has 
slowly increased over the years as 
spoken word perfonnances have 
gained exposure. Troupe said the 
renewed interest in poelry is a sign 
Ihat artists are beginning to break 
with tradition. 

"After 50 years we have 
wreatled poetry away from tradi-
tion. Poetry is oral, and we're try-
'ing to find a happy medium in 
which it is also oral and written. 
When I read in New York with 
Allen Ginsberg, there were 2,500 
to 3,000 people there. I think some 
of it had to do with Bill Moyers, 
who did that series 1 was involved 
in called 'The Power of Ihe Word.' 
It's played now in all the .high 
schools in the United States. It has 
helped poetry a lot, and now people 
want to make films." 

Though San Diego is often criti-
cized for its conservstive, subur-
ban attitudes, Troupe, who lived in 
Manhattan for 20 years, said he is 
content living here. He finds many 
multicultural aspects to the city 
despite the illueions of homogene-
ity. 

"People have that image [the 
idea that San Diego is white and 
suburban] in their heads, but it's 
not like that at all. I live in La Jolla, 
and people think it i5 a very white 
place, but you cannot live close to 
the border and not be affected by it. 
The reality is tbat this is a multi-
dimensional, mulli-ethnic, multi-
racial place. Multiculturalism 
doesn't exclude wbites. That's a 
problem people have. When we 
say 'multi,' we're not saying 'muhi, 
except for white people.' 'Multi' 
means everybody, and Ihat's what 
the United States is."

THEATRE 

Three Hotels 
San Diego Repertory production neglects human content 

By John Godfrey 
Staff Writer 
The San Diego Repertory The-

atre scored quite a coup in gain ing 
the rights to the first non-New 
York production of Jon Robin 
Baitz ' "Three Hotels." The two-
character drama arrives in San 
Diego wi th an armload of rave 
reviews, a se ries of proclamations 

rega~di ng the "i mportance" of the 
playwright and the son of Spartan 
budget requirements that make 
debt-ridden managi ng directors 
drool. 

The buzz is not undeserved: 

renowned for his skill at calmly 
firing fellow employees. As the 
speech unfolds, the shrewd Hoyle 
gradually reveals that his job -
marketing potentially harmful 
products to an unwilling clientele 
- is "morally indefensible." 
Hoyle admits to being indirectly 
responsible for a number of child 
deaths, and yet he cannot bring 
himself to renounce the lucrative 
career he has forged for himself. 

"T hree Hote ls" is a smart, highly 
lite rate play and a wonderful ve-
hicle fo r actors. It 's full of post-
1980s resonance, and it speaks 
cogently abo ut how individuals 
can lose sight of their priorities 
and ideals in the relentless pursuit 
of success. Politically, themati -
cally and dramatically , "Three 
Hotels" possesses all the neces-
sary ingredients for a superb night 
of theater. 

eye and a keen 
sense of narra-
tive detail, but 
his two actors 
a lways seem 
somehow de-
tached from the 
characters they 
depict. As a re-
sult, the play 
comes across as 

lillie more than 
an intellectual 
exercise in dra-
maticstructure. 
In concentrat-
ing on the un-
orthodox con-
struction of this 
play, Sa lovey

countries . 
Sandwiched 
between these 
monologues, 
Barbara Hoyle 
(Darla Cash) 
layers in addi-
tional informa-
tion about her 
husband Ken-
neth, offering 
details 
which further 
contextualize 
and complicate 
his moral 
struggle . The 
two characters 
cross paths dur-

From this point on, Hoyle is a 
desperate man laboring to justify 
his very existence, not to mention 
his career choi~. Baitz paints 
Hoyle into numerous moral and 
ethical comers, and it is both pain-
ful and fascinating to watch this 
character struggle to reconcile his 
idealist convictions with his cor-
porate obligations. 

The Rep's production of th is 
80-minute play, howeve r, is quite 
stilted and rather undramatic. 
UCSD lecturer Todd Salovey di -
rects the production with a subtle 

man content - the conflicting 
passions and overriding human-
ity - that drives this drama for-
ward. 

" In a hotel, nothing sticks, " 
Kenneth Hoyle (Douglas Jacobs) 
says during his first monologue. 
" It' s all transitional." Baitz wrote 
the line, but he is clearly in oppo-
sition with his central character 
here . In fact, thi s entire play is 

designed to show how individuals 
can get caught up in thinking that 
life is without substance, that our 
various choices and decisions are 
as amorphous as weekend stays in 
hotel rooms. 

"Three Hotels" comprises three 
monologues delivered in threedif-
ferent hotel rooms. The first and 
last speeches belong to Kenneth, 
an international businessman who

ing scene transitions, but they 
never speak directly to one an-
other on stage. 

Instead of transforming 
through interaction with one an-
other, Baitz' characters are trans-
formed through independent soul-
searching. As the play begins, 
Kenneth Hoyle speaks directly to 
the audience, describing hisoccu-
pation and illustrating why he is 

Barbara Hoyle's subsequent 
monologue serves primarily as a 
resonating device - she focuses 
virtually all of her attention on 
clarifying and complicating her 
husband's troubled state of being. 
In her speech, we learn about the 
Hoyles' son, Brandon, a teenager 
who died while the family was 
living in one of the Third World

Fishbone 
Ska band takes on racism 

By D .. McDowell 
Senior St.ff Writer 

The los Angeles-based band Fishbone 
has been a staple on college radio since its 
first EP Party at Ground Zero was re-
leased in 1985. Since then, the band, which 
will perform tomorrow night at 9 p.m. at 
Iguana's in Tijuana with the Mighty 
Mighty Bosstones, has matured, and its 
most recent album Give a MonJceyaBrain 
and He'll Swear He's the Center of the 
Universe addresses political and ethnic 
issues while retaining the band's distinc-
tive ska style. During a recent phone inter-
view, vocalist Angelo Moore discussed 
racism, MTV and censorship. . 
Guard"n: On. of the last ti ....

Moore: I think nothing has really 
changed. The system is still screwed up 
and there is still a lot of crime that is not 
reported. 
H •• your music been .ffected by 
the riots? 

We have always been affected by our 
surroundings and when the rebellio!l came · 
around it was a surprise but not really. It 
was more of an 'I told you so' thing after 
it. It didn't cause a great change.

.............., 
I got off the plane in New York for a 

promotional tour and a Channel lOre-
porter asked if I knew about the boy 
arrested at the Citadel Country Mall in 
Albany, New York for wearing a 
Fishbone shirt. The boy had bought the 
shirt in a store in the mall and wore it out 
into the mall . A security guard told him 
he had to leave. Once the kid started 
questioning why he couldn' t wear the 
shirt he bought in the mall a state trooper 
was called, who placed him under arrest 
for trespassing. Me and some guys from 
a local radio station went to the mall and 
taped pieces of paper that said " Fuck 
Racism " on our shirts, because we 
couldn't get any of the Fishbone shirts. 
We wanted to show freedom ofspeech. 
We talked to some people who liked it 
and others who didn't like it because we 
used the word "fuck." I want them to stop 
looking at the word "Cuck" and look at 
the context, it is d ifferent. "Fuck" gets 
their attention, shock value is important. 
It also shows that you are serious about 
racism. I deal with it in America, in the 
music business. I deal with it all the time. 
Fishbone is fed up with racism of all 
kinds. White people against black people, 
black people against white people, white 
against Japanese, Japanese against Ko-
rean and black against black. The shirt is 
a little protest. The store shouldn't sell

HOTELS: Final 
scene is a letdown 
Continued from pac. H4 
countries where Kenneth did 
business. Barbara points out 
that "When Brandon died, Ken 
turned to stone," a fact which 
made Kenneth even more ef-
fective in the corporate arena. 

In the final monologue, 
Kenneth is alone again in a 
hotel room, dictating a letter to 
his mother. His wife has left 
him, be has just been fired, and 
he is left to pick up the shat-
tered piccesofhissoulthatlay 
scattered about in sterile hotel 
rooms across the Third World. 
It's a horrible, wonderfu I scene 
full of dramatic tension and 
discov,ery, but the San Diego 
Rep production doesn't quite 
manage to capture the intense, 
despondent nature of this fi-
nale. 

Cash and Jacobs are both 
sol id, experienced, dependable 
performers, but neither man-
age to cut through Baitz' highly 
literate language and illustrate 
the emotional essence of their 
respective characters. 

Cash can be forgiven to 
some extent, since her (much 
smaller) role exists primarily 
to shed light on her husband's 
character. 

Jacobs' interpretation of 
Kenneth Hoyle is too buttoned-
up, too detached from his own 
cataclysmic descent, to carry 
the final scene. 

Certainly, Hoyle should 
come across as calm and un-
ruffled at the beginning of the 
play, but by the end of this 
searing drama the actor must 
transform his character into a 
desolate, defeated man. 

Jacobs did not show this 
evolution; instead, the .actor 
chose to keep a safe distance 
from Hoyle's tumultuous emo-
tional state. Jacobs continually 
maintained the refinement and 
the officiousness of his char-
acter even at the bitter end. As 
a res'!lt, the play ended on a 
somewhat bland note, and the 
audience was not allowed to 
witness the transformation in 
Hoyle that Baitz certainly in-
tended.

We have three videos out 
that no one has ever seen. For 
the first single MTV played it 
once, and they played it when 
the single wasn't being played 
on the radio. They basically 
fucked us over, if you don't 
have a single on the radio then 
the video won't do well, you 
have to coordinate them. We 
made a video for "Servitude" 
at the beginning of the 
Lollapalooza tour of which we 
were a part. MTV never played 
it. Then we made a third video 
whicb was never played again.

Sports is not my forti. I 
can't tell you what Rod 
Carew's batting average was in 
1978, or who the second· 
highest scorer in the NBA is, or 
who won the Stanley Cup in 
1989. The extent of my sports 
knowledge revolves around 

UCSD Can't Claw Princeton TIgers 
POISONED IVY: Tritons (0-3) left '~I'n.n 

bits of sports trivia and a few 
recognizable names and faces. 

But with the Super Bowl 
upon us yet again, fnotball has . 
become virtually impossible to 
ignore. And I must admit a 
certain affinity for the game. 

The thrill of the skirmish, 
and the underlying promise of 
witnessing great bodily injury 
from the comfort of my couch, 
has always attracted me to 
football. That, and the helmets. 

I am, however, profoundly 
superstitious, and lately it has 
occurred to me that there is 
more to the game than big men 
in pads running into each other 
and throwing an oblong ball 
around a field. 

After having watched these 
past few months, I am oon· 
vinced that Jhere is a great 
religious significance to the 
game. 

The mlsteries are much 
easier'iO'understand than, say, 
Roman Catholic confession or 
papal infallibility. In football, 
either God is on your side or 
He isn't. 

Until last Sunday, God was 
on the side of Joe Montana and 
the Kansas City Chiefs. My 
father, a staunch agnostic, 
made the mistake of betting 
against the Chiefs throughout 
the postseason, arguing lamely 
that "the Chiefs have been kind 
ofspotty lately." 

I knew better, of oourse, 
recalling that in his San 
Francisco days, Joe Montana 
was often seen healing the sick 
and walking u .... islcd across 
the Bay when he wan't 
making the 'Ninen a power to 
be feared and respected, much 
like God himself. 

"Neverbd .... the tam 
wiCh God on its Iide, "I sUd, but 
the old man wouldn't IiIfra 

Of COlIne, when the Chiefs 
were soundly trounced, 30-13, 
by Buffalo lut Sunday, I bad 
some explaining to do. Indeed, 
my own faith wu shaken. 

How could a just God allow 
his team to suffer such a 
humiliating defeat? How could 
a benevolent deity allow his

The l)CSD men '5 volleyball 
team played host to Princeton Uni· 
versity on Tuesday night and judg· 

ing from the fi-
nal outcome, 
the Tritons were 
a bit too hospi· 
table to the vis· 
iting East Coast 
"_~A..oO""'. powerhouse. 

In a three· 
game sweep, 
the Tigers dealt 
UCSD a disap-
pointing 15·11, 
15·1,15-12 de-
feat and pre· 

vented San Diego (0-3) from plac-
ing its initial notch in the win col· 
umn. 

The Tigers quickly pounced to 
an 8-1 lead in the first game, forcing 
UCSD Head Coach Doug Dannevik 
to call an early timeout to restore 
order to his team. Unfortunately, it 
didn't help. 

Princeton failed to lose even an 
ounce of its growing momentum, 
stretching the lead to a commanding 
13·3 margin. 

Undaunted, the Tritons went on 
a small kill spree, clawing back to 
within two points at 13·11, before 
Princeton Head Coach Glenn Nelson 
called a timeout of his own. 

This time, the brief respite 
worked wonders. Behind the heavy 
hitting of Tiger big men Chris 
Davidson and John Hutchison, 
Princeton finished off the Tritons to 
sieu the first game, 15·11. 

"[Hutchison and Davidson] were 
our main problems," Dannevik said. 
"We weren't able to stop them to· 
night." 

Davidson finished the contest 
with 10 kills, while Hutcbison tal· 
lied 19 on the evening. 

Involleyball'sall·important sec· 
ond set, the Jigbls came crashing 
downbcfore the T~couldblink. 

Emotionally distraught from its 
failed oomeback attempt only min· 
utes earlier, UCSDmanaged to score 
only one point in the second stanza, 
and Princeton easily marched to a 
IS· 1 COIIhing. 

The third game ofthe match mir· 
rored the first. Princeton sped out to 
a comfortable 12-6 advantage be· 
fore the Tritons made a run to make 
the waning minutes of the match a 
competitive affair. 

UCSD pulled to within a point at 
13·12, but the Tigers proved to be

too much for overmatched UCSD. 
Princeton snared the final two points 
10 complete the shutout. 

"We didn't show our true selves 
Ionight," Dannevik lAid. ·We're all 
disappointed. " 

·We proved we are a better team 
then this up in Santa Barbara," jun· 
ioroutside biUerSteve Kremsersaid. 
"They just out-hustled us." 

The Tritons now must travel to 
1..01 Angeles for a battle against the 
number-one ranked TrojansofUSC. 

"Wecan'tgo into our next match 
thinkingabout the last one," Kremser 
said. "We just have to put this match 
behind us." . 

Kremser led the Tritons with 14 
kills, while junior Tom Black 

pounded 11. 
Leading hitter Tyson Kerr was 

unable to get going in the match, 
which cost the Tritons dearly. 

"Wecouldn'tget[KerrJtheball," 
Black said. "He's our leading hitter. 
If we can't get him the ball, we can't 
win." 

Perhaps the greatest thrill for the 
fans that filled UCSD's Main Gym 
was the appearance of a few mem-
bers of the U.s. men's volleyball 
team. 

Bob Samuelson, known around 
the world for his finely shaved scalp 
and his powerful style of play ,caught 
the attention of all those in atten· 
dance. 

The Olympic star was gracious 

enough to speak with many of the 
intrigued fans. 

When asked about UCSD's pros· 
pects of becoming one of the top 
volleyball programs in Southern 
California, a region ricb in volley-
ball talent, Samuelson noted that the 
Tritons are packed with potential. 

"A school such as UCSD is ca-
pable of doing very well because of 
the atmosphere and the location. 
The team will inevitably improve 
with the higher caliber of competi· 
tion available in California," he said. 

"The school needs to establish 
itself as a Division I contender and 
then it will be able to attract athletes 
who are on the bubble at schools 
like USC and UCLA."

Tritons Steal Road Victory 
EASY PlCKlNI': Rodney Lusain swipes school-record 10 steals in 89-78 win 
BrANn-
Associate Sports Editor 

He's quick. He's feisty. He's a 
true point guard if ever there wu 
one. UCSD senior Rodney Lusain 

cause& any 0p-
posing ball-
lillili~illi1. ' handler to 

shake and 
quiver with 
fear. 

Entering 
San Diego's 
Tuesday night 
contest with 
Christian 
Heritage Col-
lege (5-17), 
Lusain aver-

aged 3.3 steals per game, placing 
him among the nation's leaders in 
Division III men's buketball. 

It is safe to say that he increased 
his average a bit against the host 
Hawks. Lusain's school-record 10 
- count 'em, 10 - steals helped 
the Tritons (1 5-4) escape with a win 
over its Southern California neigh-
bor, Christian Heritage, 89-78. 

The game wu a dogfight during 

much of the first half, with neither 
team able to extend a considerable 
lead. 

Both squads shot the ball ex-
treme�y well, with the Tritons con-
necting on a turgid 60 peR:Cnt of 
their tries and the Hawks shooting 
52 percent. 

In the waoing minutes ofthe first 
half, UCSD fUllUy converted a string' 
of unanswered buckets to give it a 
40-33 advantage heading to the 
locker room. 

The second half wu a carbon-
copy of the fint, with neither sqlWl 
willing to yield an inch. amstian 
Heritage shot the lights out from the 
field during the fmal 20 minutes, 
canning a remarkable 68 percent of 
its shots. 

Nevertheless, the Hawks failed 
to seize the lead. With Lusain swip-
ing passes and picking pockets like 
a gypsy street urchin, the Tritons 
comfortably finished off the Hawks 
by 11. 

"It wu a scrappy game," UCSD 
Head Coach Tom Marshall said. 
"[Christian Heritage] just keeps 'af-
ter you. They gave us all we could 

handle." 
The Hawks are coached by 

former NBA player Swen Nater, 
who wu renowned for patrolling 
the g1ua with authority. It showed 
in his coaching. Christian Heritage 
out-rebounded UCSD, 29-'1:1. 

"[Nater] hu his guys rebound-
ing the ball well," MarshaU said. 
"They keep working for second and 
third rebound cbanc:es." 

Senior Nate Hanlgin led a bal-
anced UCSD scoring attack with 17 
points, playing a team-high 38 min-
utes. 

Freshman Matt Auneconttibutcd 
16 points and nine rebounds, while 
senior Erik Johnson poured home 
IS points, making four out of seven 
shots from three-point range. 

Sophomore Matt Minehanscored 
15 points and sophomore Kahlil 
Allen tallied 13 points. 

In addition to his record-setting 
10 steals, Lusain abo collecled 10 
points and seven assists. 

The Tritons' next contest takes 
place on Spirit Night, Saturday, Jan. 
29 at UCSD's Main Gym against
