Police Attempt 
to Curb Noise at 
Local Parties 
Program will impose zero-
tolerance rules on houses 
found in violation 
Iy LAUREN COARTNEY 
Staff Writer 

A police program designed to curb noise 
disturbances and illegal activities associated 
with parties will soon be implemented In 
areas surrounding UCSD. 

In mid-May, the Community-Assisted 
Party Program, which has already been 
implemented In the College Area surround-
ing SDSU, will spread north to beach areas, 
and include UCSD. 

San Diego Police Department's CAPP 
provides I w enforcement and the commu-
IlIty with a way of dealing with party-related 
disturbances by "CAPPing" residences that 
habitually offend the peace of the neighbor-
hood. 

"[t is so we can bring attention to the 
[party hosts that they] are bothering their 
neighbors: said Officer Scott Morrison, 
who serves the northern beach areas includ-
ing La Jolla and UCSD. 

The CAPP creates what the SDPD calls a 
Mzero-tolerance" period of one year on des-
ignated residences. There are three ways to 
initiate the CAPP, and all three involve 
annoyed neigh bon. 

The first way is for memben of the com-
munity to gather as little as five signatures to 
voice a party-related complaint to their local 
police department. 

The second method is through the 
tracking of noise disturbance complaints. If 
a specific location receives two or three of 
these in a one-month period, it may auto-
matically be reported to the CAPPo 

Residences can also be "CAPPed" if 
police respond to a complaint and find a sit-
uation where there are belligerent partygo-
ers or illegal activities such as littering, 
underage drinking, parking violations and 
party admission charges. 

"If you're having a hundred people at a 
party, and you have people outside and loud

UCSD Receives $16.5 Million Cancer Grant 
Money will be used to study a form of chronic leukemia and may lead to other breakthroughs 
., JOIIPH LII 
Staff Writer 

UCSD was awarded a $16.5 
million grant by the National 
Cancer Institute to study chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, the most 
common form of adult leukemia. 

The grant is one of the largest 
n-cr received by the univenity. 

Thomas J. Kipps, director of the 
UCSD Cancer Center's 
lhmslational Oncology Program 
and professor at the School of 
Medicine, will lead the consortium 
responsible for conducting the 
study. 

MThe idea is to provide a forum 

in which investigations on the 
genetics and biochemistry and 
immunology can be done on the 
same specimen: Kipps said. MSO, 
for example, if we find a certain 
gene associated with CLL, we can 
now attempt to determine if that's 
related to an abnormality in a bio-
chemical pathway, an immunolog-
ical defect, or resistance to a cer-
tain drug. [n this way, we can more 
rapidly develop a comprehensive 
undentanding of the disease and 
then focus our efforts in the right 
direction." 

The grant will enable the con-
sortium to allow clinical trials to 
be available to patients much ear-

Iier after standard treatment has 
failed. Clinical trials are usually 
not available to patients until the 
final phases of testing. 

A rapid entrance into early 
phases of clinical trials will speed 
the process of bringing new ther-
apies to patients, which will in 
turn create new standards of 
care. 

"By cross-fertilizing ideas, we 
expect to generate new insights 
and novel ways of attacking this 
relentless disease: Kipps said. 

He added that the grant may 
also help with other cancer 
research projects as well . 

"While our ultimate goal is to 

cure CLL, we also believe that the 
insights we gain will shed benefi-
cial light on other types of can-
cers," Kipps said. 

David Tarin, director of the 
UCSD Cancer Center, said the 
cooperation of many people will 
lead to progress in CLL research . 

"Creating a multidiscipl inary 
consortium of distinguished peo-
ple and institutions represents an 
exceptional achievement: Tarin 
said. "This powerful convergence 
of skills will inevitably make a sig-
nificant contribution to the treat-
ment of patients with this disease."

plaints. [as long as] you have some 
people leave or come inside, you're

coordinator from the office of student 
affairs. " [CAPP officials are] reason-
able about it. The problem lies where 
they see illegal activity. and then your 
house may be 'CAPPed.'N 

If a house is put under the one-
year probation period. having a party 
in violation of the CAPP may result in 
the arrest of the resident throwing the 
party and seizure of the personal 
property responsible for the noise. 
such as a stereo. 

Additional consequences include 
extending the CAPP for another one-
year period or indefinitely. 

The CAPP report remains affiliat-
ed with the location of the incident, 
not the residents. If the offending res-
idents move, the: CAPP status stays 
with the home and with any unsus-
pecting new tenants. 

According to the SDPD, the most 
frequent problem areas for noise dis-
turbances due to parties are found 
around college campuses such as 
UCSD and SDSU. 

Although it seems the: program 
targets college students, it is designed 
to maintain the: happiness of the 
entire community. as the police are 
more than willing to work with both 
offenders and the: community. 

As well as tracking frequent com-
plaints, the police department can 
also track frequent complainers to 
ensure all further actions are justified 
and CAPP reports are not placed 
unnecessarily. 

"[CAPP] is not directly targeted 
toward college students,N Watts said. 
"We had a big discussion with (SDSU 
students] and students from USD 
who were asking if the police would 
be out looking for parties. The answer 
is no. It could be any household. ft 
could be people in their fifties throw-
ing a wine and cheese party.N 

There are few definite regulations 
pertaining to the CAPP because each 
response is tailored toward a specific 
incident. Respect for the community 
and the law should ensure against 
run-ins with the CAPP program. 
according to Watts. 

"Our real purpose is to have the 
owners be more responsible - [being 
aware of things such as] what time the 
party is going on. where people are 
parking, to make sure their guests are 
not urinating on someone else's yard 
or breaking glass.N Morrison said. " It's 
not to discourage parties.N

The consortium will be comprised 
of nine institutions, including six pro-
jects and three service centers. Five of 
the projects involve lab-based studies 
that will examine the biology of CLL. 
The sixth project is the actual clinical 
program, which will allow patients to 
enter into clinical trials using new 
developments from the first five pro-
jects. 

The consortium will also include 
renowned scientists from different 
disciplines such as genetics. cell biol-
ogy. biochemistry, immunology and 
pharmacology. 

Members will also be able to hold 
"virtual" meetings, in which they post 
slides and other information on the 
consortium's Web site. and will be 
able to discuss information by phone 
conferencing. 

The consortium will create a 
sophisticated national tissue bank 
that will collect blood samples from 
many different CLL patients, allowing 
the scientists to study the same tissue 
from different perspectives.

lecture titled 'Ireland: Will There Ever Be 
Peace?" at the Pepper Canyon Lodge Monday 
from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. 

Just as the International community joyously 
celebrated the final negotiations for peace talks 
regarding Northern Ireland after April of 1998. 
the process was suddenly halted in July of 1999 
when- Protestant unionists rejected a plan to 
implement last year's peace accord on the 
grounds that the plan required sharing power 
with the political wing of the still-armed Irish 
Republican Army.

A.5. Officers Must 
Admit Guilt, Resign 

The UCSD Guardian, concurring with and 
supporting the findings of the AS. Council's 
investigative committee, requests the fonnal, 
immediate resignation of A.S. President Tesh 
Khullar, Vice President Internal Jennifer Lee 
and Vice President Finance Eric Rovner for 
their blatant fraudulence.' 

Upon completion ' of its investigation of 
the A.S. executives - who admittedly 
forged receipts to be reimbursed with stu-
dent money - the investigative committee 
requested the immediate resignation of the 
executives at last Wednesday's AS. Council 
meeting. 

However, when the executives refused to 
comply with the committee's request, the 
A.S. senators motioned to impeach the 
councilmembers in a cowardly, secret ballot 
that violated the Brown Act. With only 12 
senators voting in favor of impeachment, 
the motion failed by two votes. Two sena-
tors voted against impeachment and four 
abstained. 

In their attempt to falsify public records, 
whether for personal gain or not, Khullar, Lee 
and Rovner have violated the delicate rela-
tionship they hold with their constituents -
whom they were elected to serve, not swindle 
- and eroded the faith we had in the AS. 
Council. 

The A.S. senators' failure to impeach 
KhuUar, Lee and Rovner is equally injuri-
ous. These senators have displayed a com-
plete lack of concern for the priorities, val-
ues and interests of all UCSD students and 
trivialized the future of student government 
at UCSD. 

By refusing to resign, the officers are fail-
ing to recognize their crime not only against 
the student population, but against the 
council as well. The executives' declination 
to leave office is an insulting demand of con-
tinued support from their co-workers, peers 
and constituents, who have been deeply 
wronged by this blatant abuse of authority. 

The four senators who abstained from 
the impeachment vote have done an espe-
cially profound disservice to their con-
stituents. The senators failed to vote deci-
sively on behalf of their electorate and 
hence failed to fulfill their duties as elected 
officials. This vote was the most influential 
the senators have faced in their terms. The 
fact that some senators withheld their votes 
is further proof of the apathy and indeci-
siveness that plagues some members of the 
A.S. Council. 

The Guardian commends Muir Senior 
Senator Guy Berger, Muir Sophomore 
Senator Shige Itoh and Warren Senior 
Senator Kevin McGinnis, who resigned in 
protest of the council's failure to impeach 
the executives. These officials at least have 
demonstrated that they have the moral 
integrity UCSD students expected of all 
their elected representatives. 

A formal apology on the part of the exec-
utives would not make amends for their 
actions and is insufficient. The executives 
should have the common dec'!I1CY - a trait 
that they certainly have not exhibited-recent-
ly - to acknowledge their guilt and resign. 

It is a shame that such a successful A.S. 
Council year is ending in persecution and 
not promise.

The Anniversary of the Vietnam War 
Offers a Chance For Reflection m America 
The Vretnam War forced America to give up its innocent view of its leaders and its 
government, but the scars of this bitter, decades-old conflict are finally healing 
IIyTOMVU 
Staff Writer 

The Vietnam War changed every-
thing. It changed the lives of my family 
members and the Vietnamese people as 
a whole. More importantly, the war, 
which ended for the United States in 
1975, revolutionized the way America 
perceived the world, America's position 
in the world and American society. The 
administratipns of Johnson and Nixon, 
and the lies and deception they embod-
ied, tarnished America's innocent view 
of itself. 

Henry Kissinger, in an article in 
NtwSlJ)tt~ called MThe Long Shadow of 
Vietnam; wrote, MVietnam broke the 
fusion of ideology and strategy that 
underlay American exceptional ism." In 
simpler words, Vietnam stole America's 
pompous perception of itself. People 
began to understand the government 
was not always right. They realized our 
leaders were not always looking out for 
the nation's best interests. The Vietnam 
War solidified this pessimistic view, and 
the effects of it are still felt today. 

April 30 marked the 25th anniversary 
of the United States' withdrawal from 
South Vietnam, finally ending 20 years of 
military intervention. A quarter of a cen-
tury later, the United States is slowly 
coming to terms with its actions in that 
tiny sliver of a jungle in Southeast Asia. 
Anger-filled movies that dealt with U.S. 
retribution and redemption in Vietnam 
have given way to films in which we, as 
Americans, can look back and reminisce 
lightheartedly, even laugh at our actions. 
With laughter comes healing, a process 
that must continue still. 

The action that our country chose, 
intervention, lasted 20 years. Twen!y 
years. An entire new generation of 
Americans was born in that time. The 
war itself and the events that led to war 
reach back into time nearly 90 years, to 
1917. To understand the scope of the 

Vietnam, the sliver of jungle, 
was a turning point in U.S. 
history and society. Not the 
Great War or D-Day, or the 
unspoken, covert, battles of 
the Cold War have had as 
great an impact as the 
Vtetnamese war. What makes 
Vtetnam so important was 
that it tore the United States 
apart at the seams. 
events, we should look back into the 
chain of events that led to the United 
States' intervention and withdrawal from 
Vietnam. 

The Great War, World War I, ended 
with a truce. At the meeting that led to 
the formation of the League of Nations, 
the president of the United States, 
Woodrow Wilson, was ap'proached by an 
Asian man of slight budd. This man, a 
Vietnamese, asked our president to help 
his country break free from the grips of 
French colonialism. Wilson turned a 
blind eye to this man and Asia in gener-
al, as the American policy focused on 
Europe in the aftermath of World War 1. 
As you have probably ascertained, the 
man's name was Ho Chi Minh. 

We can look back into our past and 
speculate about what would have hap-
pened if Wilson had actually taken the 
time to listen to what Ho Chi Minh had 
to say. However, to do so is pointless: 
what happened has happened, and noth-
ing can change the mistakes made. 

U.S. intervention in Vietnam covered 
20 years and five presidential administra-
tions. What stal1ed as a group of advisors 
sent by Eisenhower to South Vietnam 
soon turned into a small force of 

Marines under Kennedy. This group of 
Marines escalated to half a million sol-
diers under Johnson, despite his promise 
to withdraw trOOj Under Nixon the 
slow withdrawa of the 530,000 
American soldiers began. However, as 
Henry Kissinger wrote, MNixon, who 
inhented this impasse lofthe war, both at 
home and in Vietnaml, lacked the 
human qualities to transcend it.w 

While withdrawing troors. Nixon still 
bombed Hanoi with 8-52 s and fought 
an illegal war in Cambodia. When Nixon 
was forced out of office, Vice President 
Gerald Ford inherited the painful duty of 
withdrawal. Ford silently watched on 
television, with his head between his 
hands, tortured, as the last American 
helicopter lifted off from the American 
embassy in Saigon, full of Americans and 
Vietnamese refugees. 

Vietnam, the sliver of jungle, was a 
turning point in U.S. history and society. 
Not the Great War or D-Day, or the 
unspoken, covert, battles of the Cold 
War have had as great an impact as the 
Vietnamese war. What makes Vietnam so 
important was that it tore the United 
States apart at the seams. The intense 
opposition to the war on the home front 
reflected the fierce battles fought in the 
steamy jungles halfway across the world. 
Anti-war demonstrations became com-
,"onplace all over the nation, particular-
'1}' on college campuses, including UCSD. 
The battle was between the older gener-
ation, which believed the war served a 
higher purpose, and the younger genera-
tion, which believed war was not neces-
sary. 

For the first time, Americans at home 
were able to watch a war on television, 
thanks to the new gung-ho approach 
that news reporters took. Newscasters 
reported from the front lines of the bat-
tles. Families were able to watch a live 
broadcast of the fighting and witnessed

Make San Diego BiHngual 
California'S government denies Spanish heritage 
Columnist 

[ am a gringa. I was raised in a 
very white, English-speaking house-
hold. I was 13 before [ learned to 
count in Spanish, and my ability to 
communicate en espaiiol has pro-
gressed very slowly from there. [ 
have continued to work on my flu-
ency in Spanish because it interests 
me, but more importantly, because I 
live in San Diego. With the percent-
age of Spanish speakers in California 
going up every day, it makes sense to 
be able to communicate in both 
English and Spanish. It makes my 
life easier. 

I was very interested, then, when 
I noticed an snicle in this week's San 
Ditgo Reader titled MBattle of the 
Tongues.w Apparently, there is a 
movement in San Antonio, Texas 
toward bilingual, biliterote education 
from prekindergarten through high 
school. With strong sUPPOI1 from 
the community, the campaign aims 
to educate children in both lan-
guages so they can better function in 
their bilingual society. 

Lorena Gonzalez, the woman 
spearheading the campaign, points 
out that Memployers are paying more 
in San Antonio if you have a second 
language, preferably Spanish, 
because of our proximity to 
Mexico." 

This is true in almost any pan of 
the globe. Most children in Europe 
grow up learning several languages, 
not because it is fun and easy to do, 
but because it makes them more 
competitive in a global environment. 
Ditto for the kids in Japan. • 

Why, then, is San Diego so 
opposed to Spanish? 

California's Proposition 227, 
which prohibits any instruction in 

Spanish at the elementary level, 
shows the state's dominant MEnglish 
only" stance. Despite the regton's 
rich Hispanic heritage (we stole 
California from Mexico. remember?) 
and the fact that it borders Mexico, 
we continue to deny Spanish any 
place in our society. Because of this 
denial, children on both sides of the 
language barrier are suffering. 

Notice that I pointed out both 
sides. Just as there are a bunch of 
kids who do not speak Spanish, 
there are a bunch of kids in San 
Diego school disuicts who do not 
speak a lot of English. A concerted 
effort needs to be made to make all 
these children bilingual and biliter-
ate, so that th~ can function in 
southern Cahfornia. Pushing 
Spanish out of the classroom does 
not in any way accomplish this. 

For those of you trapped in La 
Jolla, ignorant of the multilin8ual 
nature of our city, I have a httle 
experiment. Get on the 805 free-
way and drive south. Get off in 
National City and try to read the 
billboards. Unless readers have 
passed their Spanish proficiency 
requirements, they might have a 
hard time. Some might even feel 
vaguely powerless. What if that 
billboard says something impor-
tant and many cannot read it? If 
everything in San Diego were in 
English, it would not be a prob-
lem to use it exclusively in the 
classroom. Unfonunately, that is 
not the case. 

San Diego, like San Antonio, is a 
multilingual city, dominated by both 
English and Spanish. San Antonio 
has recognized this and is working 
toward bilingualism, and even multi-
lingualism, in its educational system. 
Why can't San Diego?

Vietnam: 
For a long time, America 
was in denial over the war 

the fallacy of the war, all over din-
ner. No longer were we the invin-
r,ible nation that could do no 
wrong. Our victories in the two 
world wars and the Korean War 
paled in comparison to the hun-
dreds of bodies of American boys 
that came home in black bags 
each clay. 

Greater than the social unrest 
was the underlying notion of a 
government gone out of control. 
Vietnam laid out America's inno-
cence and naivete and crushed it, 
as Americans questioned the pur-
pose and morality of the war. The 
lies and the deception of Johnson 
and Nixon completely warped th is 
country's perception of the gov-
ernment and our leaders. 

MWe are not about to send 
American boys nine or 10 thou-
sand miles away from home to do 
what Asian boys ought to be 
doing for themselves; LBJ 
promised in 1964, just before 
escalating the war. Even as he 
withdrew troops from the war 
front, Nixon waged what amount-
ed to an illegal war in Cambodia. 
False reports on the progress of 
the war and of the death tolls fur-
ther eroded the people's faith in 
the government. Anger and disbe-
lief turned to pessimism and cyn-
icism, effects still felt today as evi-
dent by the amount of distrust we 
have for our leaders. 

The truth was painfully plain 
and simple - America had lost 
the war. For nearly 15 years, it did-
n't seem as if Americans were 
ready to accept this fact. America, 
the world's most powerful nation, 
could not have lost a war. Not to a

tiny country like Vietnam, whose 
soldiers were a Third World guer-
rilla force. For years afterward 
Americans revisited Vietnam to 
refight the war through films such 
as "Rambo" and "Missing in 
Action" in an effol1 to set things 
right. 

Just as a wound becomes a scar 
if it is not left alone to heal, the 
constant barrage of books and 
Hollywood movies during the 
1980s that refought the war 
turned Vietnam into a scar on 
American society. "Hamburger 
Hill" and "Platoon" portrayed 
America's lerception of the war: 
the mixe feelings about the 
Vietnamese people that ranged 
from hate to helplessness, the 
obliqueness and ignorance of our 
leaders and the immorality of the 
war itself. The inabi lity to speak of 
Vietnam without referring to the 
war stifled this country's ability to 
reconcile its actions and to begin 
the healing process. Now every 
military action that places United 
States soldiers on foreign soil , be 
it in Nicaragua, Kuwait, Somalia, 
Haiti, Bosnia or Kosovo, calls to 
mind images of Vietnam and ref-
erences to it. 

Twenty years since the fall of 
Saigon, America 's scars are start-
ing to heal. America has slowly 
been able to come to terms with 
its actions in Vietnam, both the 
positives events and, more often, 
the negative ones, the most hor-
rendous being the My Lai 
Massacre. Since the early 1990s, 
America has undergone a reversal 
of perceptions of the war and its 
effects. The anger and disbelief 
over the Uni ted States' loss of the 
war turned into an acceptance of 
the outcome. Yes, America had 
lost, but there was no embarrass-
ment or loss of face by admitting 
this. Yes, the United States made 
mistakes, but these same mistakes 

OPINION 5 

will not happen again: there will 
not be another Vietnam War. 

Hollywood movies reflect this 
change in moods. Current films 
such as "Forrest Gump" reflect 
our views of the war and our reac-
tion toward it. which have 
changed dramatically. Hollywood 
no longer revisits Vietnam in the 
form of the noble, savage hippie. 
or the rescue mission to save 
American soldiers left behind 
during the withdrawal. These 
stereotypical plots were a subcon-
scious attempt by Americans to 
revisit Vietnam and finish the war. 

America can look back at the 
Vietnam War not with frustration 
but humor. We can recognize our 
mistakes in the war and can actu-
ally laugh at them. Obviously, this 
is not to say that anything about 
the war is humorous. I am simply 
implying that by actually being 
able to laugh at the display of the 
war in "Forrest Gump" only 
shows how much progress we 
have made in the last decade to 
reconcile our past decisions with 
one another. Laughter is the 
beginning of a process of healing. 

The reconciliation with 
Vietnam has taken place not only 
in a social context but on a politi-
cal level as well. Relations between 
the United States and Vietnam 
have slowly been getting better 
since Clinton took office in 1992. 
The building of another American 
embassy in Hanoi shows the com-
mitment to reconciliation on both 
sides, perhaps leading to normal-
ized relations. 

The economic prospects in 
Vietnam are likewise highly 
attractive. Until the Asian eco-
nomic crises during the summer 
of 1997, Vietnam's economy was 
rising sharply as foreign invest-
ment poured into the country.

Active Student Participation in Politics Can Keep A.S. Council Accountable 
Editor: 
After reading the three-part 

series examining the A.S. executives' 
trip to ew York, we are extremely 
disappointed in the executives' lead-
ership decision but, at the same 
time, are trying to find some good in 
It TIle optimists in us want this to be 
one big learning experience for our 
campus as a community, because 
incidents like this happen in tht: 
"real world" all the time and go 
unmentioned. We are fortunate 
enough to have this event publicized 
for all to read. We see this experience 
as potentially creating a sizable shift 
in the way the A.S. Council is held 
accountable by the body it governs. 

Reality reveals. on the whole, the 
apathetic air that pervades thIS cam-
pus is still not disturbed or remotely 
bothered. We will not exclude our-
selves from this apathetic ene,rgy. 
We, too, are guilty of not continu-
ously con erning ourselves with stu-
dent issues. let alone current events 
around the world. However, we 
think thIS event can be a wake-up 
call. It should not be a shock to any-
one that people in power can and do 
abuse power, if given the opportuni-
ty. This is a notion to which we are 
all very accustomed and even com-
fortable with (a sorry concept in 
ItsdQ. The dIfference this time is that 
we - th' tudents - expenenced 
the abuse on a personal and micro-
cosmic level. 

Quite frequently, abuses of 
power occur on national and gov-
rrnment levels (e.g. frivolous trips to 
the Hamptons with taxpayers' 
money), but this particular incident 
was executed by members of our 
very own campus! 

Apathy is acceptance. This apa-
thy starts with our measly voting 
turnout. If we do not make it a per-
sonal responsibility to inform our-
selves about candidates and exercise 

our right to vote, we must be willing 
to accept the decisions that the 
elected make. Moreover, our 
involvement should include more 
than a vote - anend an A.S. Council 
meeting, visit the third floor of the 
Price Center to talk with council 
members, meet with your college 
senators to be sure that they repre-
sent your opinion in their voting 
practice ... at least keep yourself 
abreast of the issues with which the 
council is faced by reading Guardian 
blurbs, the posted finance reports or 
meeting minutes. We know that this 
is an idealistic approach. It's not like 
we are students without a million 
things to do aside from "checking 
up" on council members. 

So what should we do? Morality 
is a quality that we all look for in a 
leader but one very difficult to ascer-
tain quickly on meeting a candidate. 
These leaders were weak. They knew 
the cIlannels to work through to get 
what they personally wanted and 
lost sight of the purpose in their 
positions - to serve us students and 
work in our best interests with our 
money. Electing on a first impres-
sion can be just as harmful as elect-
ing on looks or drawing a name out 
of a hat Especially with a student 
population this large, how do we get 
to know candidates enough to trust 
them with our money and deci-
sions? The answer, apparently, is 
that we don't, and to think we can is 
foolish ... unless we are ready to get 
burned like each of us did by this 
foursome. [nstead, we must take it 
on as our personal responsibility to 
continuously question A.S. Council 
policy and action. 

H wever, we never concern our-
selves with these events. [n fact, we 
only concern ourselves with those 
events and experiences that occur in 
our personal lives. Essentially, we 
separate the personal frpm the polit-

On the night of Tuesday, Aprl118, 
485 UCSD students were subjected 
to verbal assault by employees of 
Price Center Theater. On this partic-
ular evet1ing. the theater was show-
ing the film "American Beauty; an 
immensely popular, Oscar-winnin~ 
production. As would be expected, 
every seat available was sold. In fact. 
so many tickets were sold that it 
became necessary to add folding 
cIlairs to the already great number of 
theater seats, thus overcrowding the 
theater and surpassing the legal max-
imum capacity of the room. 

The film was scheduled to begin 
at 10 p.m. The film began at 10:40 
p.m. During the 40 minutes through 
which most patl'Ons waited, a large 
number of insults were directed at 
them. The employees of the theater 
demanded that patrons move to 
inside seats to fill the theater faster, 
threatening them with such things 
as "cutting their balls off" and "never 
starting the movir" if they did not 
obey. The harassment and obsceni-
ties continued full force until the 
room finally tilled. 

The comments made by employ-
ees of the theater were incredibly 
offensive, and no individual paying 
money to a business should ever be 
forced to tolerate such treatment [ 
would like to advise all students not 
to mend films at Price Center 

Theater any longer. Price Center 
Theater is a business like any other, 
and every person who attended the 
showing of "American Beauty" 
deserves a formal apology.

of responding to Simone Santini's 
piece "Science Cannot Verify the

mix of truth and fiction . 

The Ianer half of the article dis-
cusses what the author calls "the 
epistemological" problem with veri-
fication of the Bible's theological 
claims through sciet1ce. The argu-
ment that much of the Bible's truth

it) cannot be established through the

often enough. 

However, when the author

gone too far. Those who believe that 
science can support the theological 
truth of scripture are ignoring a

Vietnam: 
The two nations are slowly 
reamciling their differences 
Despite floundering the last three 
years, Vietnam was recently 
named by the British 
Broadcasting Corporation as hav-
ing the potential to be counted 
among Asia's four tigers in the 
near future. 

The United States' interest in 
restoring relations with Vietnam 
extends beyond economic possi-
bilities, however. For the United 
States, restoration of relations 
equates to coming to terms with 
the Vietnam War. All the ghosts 
of guilt and frustration of 20 
years can finally be exorcised. 
Once that happens. the scar on 
the fabric of American history 
can be lifted and the healing and 
reconciliation can begin . 

"No 'healing.' no apologies. no 
memorials. nothing can possibly 
compensate for the damage done 
and the pain inflicted ... , The only 

thing we can possibly do, 20 years 
too late. is to try and tell the truth.: 
historian Eric Bergerud wrote In 
"Red Thunder, Tropic Lightning: 
[ would have to agree with 
Bergerud. What's done is done and 
cannot be ftxed. Nothing can com-
pensate for the pain, but some 
healing can still occur. It is integral 
that we, as a nation, understand 
that by approaching the war head-
on can we finally banish the 
demon that haunts American pol-
itics and society. 

Let the truth be told: 58,000 
soldiers - Americans - did not 
die a senseless death in a sense-
less war that never should have 
happened, despite what Robert 
McNamara claims. They died 
defending a nation, my country, 
and for that [ will always be 
grateful. They died in defense of 
their own country, revealing to 
the people, their fathers and 
mothers and siblings, the lies 
and deceit of the government. 
They died so that there could be 
peace in the world, 30, 50, 100 
years from now.

U.S.-Russian Talks Revive Old Debates 

American proposals to change a 
key arms control agreement have 
revived some of the more impor-
tant, if arcane, debates over nuclear 
strategy that not long ago seemed 
consigned to the dustbin of the 
Cold War. 

One of those strategies is called 
"launch on warning" and is widely 
viewed as raising the risk of acci-
dental nuclear war. 

It was mentioned recently in 
documents American negotiators 
gave Russian officials in an effort to 
persuade them to amend the 1972 
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and let 
the United States build a limited 
missile defense. 

The documents, presented to the 
Russians in januaty, were obtained 
by The New York Tunes, which 'Pub-
lished parts of them last week. 

Opponents of changes to the 
ABM treaty are now charging that 
the Clinton administration is 
encouraging Russia to engage in a 
high-risk nuclear strategy. But 
American officials strongly deny 

that charge, saying they are simply 
acknowledging the reality of what 
Moscow might do in time of war. 

The launch on warning strategy 
is essentially this: If a ddender 
detected a nuclear launch, it would 
send up its own missiles and war-
heads even bdore its enemy's could 
hit the ground. That way, a country 
would not be left ddenseless by 
having its missiles destroyed while 
they were still sining in their sub-
marines and silos. 

Launch on warning was once 
seen as a way to reinforce the idea 
that all sides would lose in a 
nuclear exchange - and thus deter 
one - as modem arms became 
increasingly accurate. 

The problem, most experts on 
strategy say, is that it also puts 
nuclear war on a hair trigger. And it 
increases the risks of an accidental 
nuclear exchange because early 
warning systems are notoriously 
faulty. In 1995, for instance, the 
Russians misread the launching of 
an American weather rocket from 

Norway as a surprise nuclear attack. 
If not caught by vigilant humans, 
such false alerts can start an acciden-
tal exchange of nuclear missiIes. 

Despite such dangers, the new 
American documents mention 
launch on warning in an approving 
context. They say it would help 
guarantee that the United States 
would not strike first in a disarm-
ing attack, even if it had a missile 
defense, which strategists. as well as 
the Russians, see as destabilizing 
because in theory it can give one 
side a protective advantage. 

A Russian policy of launch on 
warning would thus continue to 
insure that both sides would lose in 
any nuclear exchange. 

"It is ~ighly unlikely: the d~u­
ments said, that an enemy With a 
shield would ever attack Russia 
because Moscow could launch its 
missiles on warning of attack, 
"which would neutralize the effec-
tiveness of the assault."

people's suffering - instead of 
using their problems to support 
its bid to end sanctions - it 
would be easier for me to see 
sanctions as the primary culprit: 
Hall said in his report. 

He criticized Iraq for trying to 
import items that could have mil-
itary uses under cover of the pro-
gram that allows Iraq to sell 
unlimited quantities of its oil to 
meet civilian needs. 

That tactic has contributed to 
delays in the Security Council 
process of approving import 
contracts. 

Hall, who has been active in 
international relief and develop-
ment projects since he was a 
Peace Corps volunteer 30 years 
ago, has been sympathetic, he 
said, to calls from religious lead-
ers and aid workers who con-
tend that sanctions are causing 
suffering for civilians and who 
demand that the United Nations 
lift them. He saId, however, that 
he did not believe ending the 
embargo would provide much 
comfort to Iraqis.

National News Bioengineering Said to Produce Benefits 
ABC: 
Several large cities may 
block the network 

scheduled to be blocked from 
cable boxes in 3.5 million homes 
in seven key markets as of 12:01 
a.m. Monday. 

The other cable systems affect-
ed are Wilmington, N.C.; 
Columbus, Ohio; suburban 
Milwaukee, Wis.; some parts of 
lentral Philadelphia; and the 
Raleigh, .C., area. 

As of 6 p.m. Sunday neither 
side had blinked. 

The immediate concern has 
been how much Time Warner 
should pay Disney for the right to 
carry Disney and ABC channels 
on its cable systems. 

The talks have also highlighted 
some of the complex issues facing 
players in the emerging new 
media universe, which could be 
dominated by AOL Time Warner 

when that merger is completed. 
The dispute ~ late last year 

when Disney asked for several con-
cessions from Time Warner in 
return for allowing lime Warner to 
continue carrying seven of its ABC 
stations. Disney has demanded that 
Time Warner cable systems not 
only feature its new channels -
Toon Disney and the Soap 
Channel - but also make the 
Disney Channel part of the basic . 
service packages, and lime Warner 
says the company has asked for as 
much as $300 million 'for the right 
to carry the channels. Time Warner 
has agreed to Disney's demands 
regarding the channels, but it has 
balked at the amount of money it 
says Disney is seeking. 

As negotiations continued, 
executives said, Disney also raised 
concerns that a merged AOL 
Time Warner would have too 
much power in the coming age of 
interactive television.

The power of genetic en$ineer-
ing is providing scientists WIth the 
ability to create animals that con-
found the imagination. 

The most striking of the new 
creatures being concocted by 
plucking a gene from one organism 
and inserting it into the DNA of 
another are what are known as 
·pharm" animals. 

These domesticated beasts -
cows, pigs, goats, sheep and chick-
ens - have been given the ability 
to produce pharmaceuticals and 
other valuable substances in their 
JIlilk, eggs 9r semen. 

Endo~ by scientists with 
foreign genes, often taken from 
humans, these animals, or biore-
actors, as they are also known, 
earn their keep as living chemical 
factories. 

Two companies, Genzyme 
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., and 
PPL Therapeutics, a Scottish com-
pany, already have products from 
·pharm" animals being tested in 
clinical trials supervised by the 
Food and Drug Administration.

Many other animals are still in 
the development stage. For exam-
ple, Nexia Biotechnologies in 
Canada is working on a goat that 
carries a gene from spiders allow-
ing it to produce spider silk in its 
milk. When the spIder silk, which 
consists of extremely strong. light 
proteins, is extracted from the 
goat's milk. the substance, poten-
tially, can be used in applications 
like bulletproof vests. 

Scientific competition is fierce. 
Some compounds of interest, like 
the human blood protein erythro-
poietin, which has not yet been 
produced by a "pharm" animal, 
commands prices of more than 
$15 million an ounce. 

"There is no limit to what can 
be done: said Francois Pothier, 
reproductive biologist at the 
University of Laval in Canada, 
who is working on a pig that is 
genetically engineered to produce 
a drug. 

Pothier declined to name the 
substance, but because research 
required to create these animals 

can take years, the drugs they pro-
duce, he said, have to be ·very 
interesting and very expensive." 
Pothier said his pigs would pro-
duce a drug in their semen, which 
the pigs could be trained to 
donate regularly in voluminous 
quantities. 

Because they are domesticated 
and are so valuable, "phann" ani-
mals are extremely unlikely to 
escape or pose any environmental 
threat. However, they may still pose 
risks. Animal tissues and fluids can 
contain other disease-causing con-
taminants, like prions, a poorly 
undefstood class of molecules 
associated with maladies including 
mad cow disease. 

In addition, while animal 
rights groups have remained rela-
tively quiet on the issue of genet-
ically engineered animals, some 
say that the use of animals as liv-
ing .factories raises troubling ethi-
cal Issues.

Lockwood admitted to police 
that he had been posing .. Kdly in 
Internet chatrooms and in e-mail 
COf!!SPOndena with Kujawa. 

Kujawa told friends he would 
retum to CoIItie Station on April 
10. After days 1iad passed and he 
failed to return, Kujawa's parents 
received e-mail messages purpon-
edIy from him. 

The e-mails usually ended with: 
"111 be back in a few days, every-
thing is okay. Don't worry. I'm still 
taking care of Kelly." 

Authorities said the c-mails to 
Ku~'s parents were sent after he 
was killed. 

-Kelly's· e-mail address was 
used to send the c-mail messages 
to Kujawa's parents and friends, 
officials said. 

Authorities said tracing the e-
mails from Lockwood were key in 
cracking the case. 

Bob WIIU, director of the 
University Police Department, said 
Lockwood has used the e-mail

According to The AssocUzttd 

Prrss, Lockwood said he accidental-
ly shot Kujawa in the back of the 
head. and then hid the body in the 
trunk of Kujawa's car. 

'TWo days later, Lockwood drove 
Kujawa's vehicle to a ranch west of 
Austin and disposed of the body. 
lie then drove to College Station, 
where he left the car at Easterwood 
Airport in long-term parking. 

It is' unclear where the shooting 
took plac:e. 

Lockwood was arrested at a San 
Antonio hospital. where he was a 
patient, according to a statement 
from the Hays County Sheriffs 

Department. Lockwood was 
released from Methodist Specialty 
and ThmspIant Hospital and was 
taken to the Hays County jail short-
ly after his arrest. Hospital 
spokesperson Palmira Arellano 
declined to comment on the reasons 
for Lockwood's hospitalization. 

Wiatt could not comment on the 
possibility of sexual assault in the 
case. but said an autopsy could reveal 
that information. However, it is p0s-
sible that any information relating to 
the autopsy would not be released 
until the suspect goes to trial. 

Lockwood is being held on a 
$250,000 bond.

THE ABC's OF 
HEPATITIS 

According to the Center for Disease 
Control, hepatitis C will be the epidemic 
of the miUennium. 

Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the 
liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. 
According to WebMD, a health Web site. 
at www.wtbmd.com the HCV causes most 
cases of hepatitis after a blood transfu-
sion. Other risk factors include environ-
mental or occupational exposure to 

. blood, intravenous drug abuse and sexu-
al transmission. 

The rate of infection for hepatitis C is 
~pected to surpass that of AIDS. For 
every one person that is infected with 
AIDS. the~ are more than four infected 
with hepatitis C, according to Hepatitis 
Central, a hepatitis support group. The 
Center for Disease Control estimates 
that there are up to 230,000 new hepati -
tis C infections in the United States every 
year. 

Currently, there are about 200 million 
people worldwide who are infected with 
the HCy' more than four million of 
whom live in the United States, accord-
ing to Hepatitis Central. 

Symptoms of hepatitis C include 
jaundice, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, 
and vomiting. fever, pale or clay-colored 
stool, dark urine and generalized itching. 
These symptoms are most severe during 
acute hepatitis. and according to the 
CDC, the~ is no specific treatment for 
the acute infection.

foundation states that clean syringe 
exchanges help reduce unsafe injec-
tion practices, curtail transmission of 
infectious diseases such as hepatitis 
and Hrv; and increase the safe dispos-
al of used syringes. This important 
component puts injection drug users 
in frequent contact with professionals ' 
who can help users obtain treatment. 

Alliance estimates that a harm 
reduction progra.m might cost approx-
imately $200,000 per year in San 
Diego County. In comparison, it esti-
mates that if San Diego had estab-
lished this program in 1995, 30. per-
cent fewer children would be infected 
with Hrv; 1,000 fewer adults would be 
infected with either hepatitis B or 
hepatitis C, and $129 million would 
have been saved in medical costs. 

"Nearly everyone working in public 
health today supports a needle 
exchange program: said Stephanie 
Casenza, an Alliance spokeswoman, 
adding that such a program has been 
working in Europe for 20 years and 
has been proven to be effective in 
reducing disease. 

The National Academy of Sciences, 
American Medical Association, CDC, 
National Institutes of Health (NIH),

1\vo months ago, I had the 
chance to put this maxim to the 
test in my own fiR in the form of 
Lent, the time of personal change 
and reflection leading to Easter In 
the Christian calendar. 

I had never observed Lent 
before - I was baptized Easter 
weekend - and was uncenain 
about what would be an appropri-
ate aspect of my life to chanse. 

I watched my friends give up 
various things over the years such 
as meat, coffee, chocolate and 
dessert, all with varying degrees of 
success. None of these things, 
however, is a vital part of my life; I 
was raised in a household where 

meat was at the bonom of the 
menu. and I do not drink coffee in 
the morning. in fact, I have never 
even tried it (if you want to avoid a 
predestinate scratched face, stay 
away from me until I have been 
awake for at least lS minutes). 

I felt that if I was going to make 
a sacrifice, it had to be more of a 
test than merely abstaining from 
something I would indulge in peri-
odically or not at all. 

'The question of what to give up 
for 4() days was one I pondered for 
quite a while. I finally decided to 
make a variety of small, stringent 
changes in my life I would not only 
give up chocolate, but anything 
remotely junk-like or succulent:

changing my diet, I decided to wallt 
to school at least one way each day, 
as I live less than two miles from 
campus and figured that it certain-
ly would not hun to get a little 
exercise. 

Some of my friends were taken' 
aback at how nit-picky some of my 
self-regulations were. For example, 
I allowed myself to eat 81's pizza 
because it is served in a sit-down 
restaurant environment, while 
Domino's pizza was off limits 
because it is delivered (as if this fact 
somehow contributes to its insalu-

brio us nature). My mandates 
became a game, a way of testing 
myself to see if I could really 
accomplish what I had put myself 
up to. 

In the first week of my endeav-
or, I was shocked at how easy it was 

to remove something inherently 
UMccessary from my liR. I had 
usually gone after junk food and 
rides home out of apathy and 
lethargy. It took little effon to 
change that around. There were 
many times when it would have 
been more convenient to skip over 
to Wendy's for a bctween-cJasses

test to sec who could be the first to 
finish a Five-by-Five (a burger with 
five patties and five slices of cheese). 
I am not cenain whether I will want 

to face another fast food meal for a 
long while after having beheld that 
spa:tac:lc. 

My experiences since March are 
valuable to me for a number of rea-
sons. What I find most refreshing 
about them is the fact I was not try-
ing to better myself by stepping on 
anybody else. Although I am sure I 
must have negatively affected the 
sales of Frito-Lay and Ghirardclli 
in the past two months. I made 
myself more independent and 
healthier without having to take 
anybody eJse down in the process. My sell-~tion also proved to 
be bendicial beause it was not 
motivated by a desire to drop to a 
certain weight or clothing size. 
What I did not do was make myself 
a better competitor in society but I 
did affirm that I have the resolution 
to carry through with something I 
rcaIIy want to ao. 

Lent is over and I am free to cat 
as I like. All the same. I annot envi-
sion living as I used to and I am 
hcalthier as a result There is noth-
ing more empowmng than knowing 
your limits. how much you can ask 
of yourself and how much you can 
fulfill with your own drtcrmination. 

I recommend that all people 
make a change in their own lives, 
whether its motivation is religious 
or secular, and see the good that 
can come of it. Being superior to 
your fonner self is indeed a noble 
thing.

By UNDA C. lUCK 
Tribune Media Services 

..... (March 21-AprIl19) 
Money's a big theme this week 

- and maybe all year. On Monday, 
you'll be confident, and you'll make 
good financial decisions. Study 011 
Tuesday and gather pennies on 
Wednesday and Thursday. Study 
ways to peddle your talents on 
Friday and relax over the weekend. 
You may be surprised at how tiring 
wheeling and dealing is. 

T.,.. (April 20-May 20) 
You are large and in charge this 

week. You're settling in as a strong 
character, so they all better get 
used to it. Decide what you want 
on Monday. Do the homework all 

week and then take action on 
Friday. That's your best choice for 
success and financial abundance. 
Do the chores on Saturday so you 
can relax with friends on Sunday. 

...... 1 (May 21-June 21) 
Instead of worrying this week, 

finish old business. That's the 
quickest way to feel better. Friends 
are there for you on Monday and 
Thesday; just ask. Review your 
career plan on Wednesday and 
Thursday. On Friday, take steps in 
the right direction. This weekend 
should be good for shopping. 
You'll be in a thrifty mood. 

c.c.r (June 22-July 22) 
Being involved in a big project 

this week is good for you. Be 
patient on Monday and Thesday. 
With your friends' help, you can 
finish a tough job. A team you 
organize on Wednesday and 
Thursday could be quite success-
ful . Delegate as much as possible 
on Friday and Saturday; there's too 
much to do by yourself. You'll be in 
fine form on Sunday. Follow your 
instincts and find a real treasure. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
You might be somewhat frus-

trated this week. You want to 

The UCSD Guardian 

move forward on Monday and 
Thesday, but the path's littered 
with obstacles. Look out! There's 
liable to be an even bigger test on 
Wednesday or Thursday. Your 
friends come to your rescue 
around Friday or Saturday. Don't 
rely on them; they may be late. 
Recuperate on Sunday and pon-
der the lessons you've learned. 

~ (Aug. 2J.Sept. 22) 
Figure out how to get the 

money on Monday and Tuesday. 
You may have an opportunity 
involving travel or higher educa-
tion on Wednesday or Thursday. If 
you want either of those, or to 
publish a book, move quickly. 
You'll be busy on Friday and 
Saturday. Along with your regular 
chores, you have to care for an 
older person. It may be Sunday 
before you have time to play with 
friends. Make the arrangements 
earlier. 

un (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
You need to watch your 

investments this week and figure 
out how to make good deals. 
Confer with your partner on 
Monday and Tuesday. You might 

Exchange: 
Needle exdumge program is 
not without its opponents 
c .................... l1 
long as they were well-monitored 
and low profile. 

"The scientific literature shows 
that for those persons who comply 
with a clean needle exchange pro-
gram, showing up each week, turn-
ing in their old needles, that popu-
lation can reduce its HIV/AlDS 
transmission by 30 to 35 percent." 
said Robert Ross, director of the 
county's Health and Human 
Services Agency.· 

The problem is reaching users, 
according to Howard j. Worman, 
M.D. 

"In order to have a truly effec-
tive program you would want 10 
enroll the majority of the county's 
intravenous drug users in a pro-
gram, and I have difficulty grasping 
that in a relatively conservative 
environment like San Diego 
County: Ross said. 

Rossaddedthatheisconcemed 
by reports that needle exchange 
tends to bring needle users togeth-
er, enhancing the social aspect of 
drug use and subsequent needle-
sharing behavior. 

The problem exists on a philo-
sophicallevel, Casenza said. 

"Who could rightly support 

Monday, May 1, 2000 

drug addiction? The problem is 
they don't understand the psychol-
ogy of addiction." said Casenza. 

The San Diego Board of 
Supervisors and The San Diego 
Union-Tribune are the major oppo-
nents in San Diego. Currently, oppo-
nents of needle exchange programs 
are outnumbered by supporters 

The San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors feels that supporting a 
needle exchange program would be 
sending the wrong message, espe-
cially to children. 

According to John Weil, chief of 
staff for Supervisor Pam Slater, 
needle exchange programs are bad 
because they encourage drug use. 

"Needles take lives whether 
they are clean or -dirty, and that's 
the board's position," Wei! said. 
"Supervisor Slater thinks needle 
exchange is bad policy .... IShel 
does not believe that the govern-
ment should be in the business of 
providing needles to' addicts.· 

According to Supervisor 
Dianne Jacob, needle exchange 
programs legitimize the use of ille-
gal drugs. When asked, Jacob 
refused to support the program. 

"No, no, no. A thousand times, 
no." Jacob said. "It's wrong for gov-
ernments to say it's OK to use ille-
gal drugs as long as you use a clean 
needle:

Hepatitis: 
Risk is irureased with 
promiscuous sexual activity 

~froM"",l1 
"Major routes of transmission 

among adults in Western countries 
are intravenous drug use and sexu-
al contact," Worman said. 

According to Worman, HBV 
also caus s acute and chronic 
hepatitis. 

"The chances of becoming 
chronically infected depends upon 
age: Worman said. "About 90 per-
cent of infected neonates and 50 
percent of infected young children 
will become chronically infected. In 
contrast, only about 5 percent of 
adults infected with HBV develop 
chronic hepatitis B." 

College students are particularly 
at risk of contracting hepatitis B, 
according to Dr. William Schaffner, 
chairman of the depanment of pre-
ventive medicine at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center. 

"It is not uncommon for college 
students to engage in behavior that 
may put them at risk for contract-
ing hepatitis B,like having sex, get-
ting tattoos or sharing a tooth-
brush." Schaffner said. 

Hepatitis A is rare in the United 
States, with about 200,000 new 
infections each year. The CDC 
reports that 33 percent of Americans 
have evidence of past infection. HAV 
is more common in developing 
countries, where it is usually 
acquired during childhood. 

The National Center for 
Infectious Diseases states that 
transmission may occur during 
person-to-person contact; from 
contaminated water, ice or shellfish 
harvested from sewage-contami-
nated water; or from fruits, vegeta-
bles or other foods that are eaten 
uncooked but may become conta-
minated during handling. Unlike 
hepatitis Band C, blood-borne 
transmission is rare. 

A vaccine against hepatitis A and 
B is available and highly effective in 
preventing spread of the disease. 

The Student Health Center 
provides hepatitis A and B immu-
nizations Monday through Friday 
from 8 a.m. to 11 :30 p.m. except 
for Wednesday, when the Health 
Center opens at 9 a.m. Hepatitis A 
immunizations are a series of two 
shots that are $55 per injection. 
Hepatitis B immunizations are a 
series of three shots that are $33 
per injection.

Student Health at 534-3300.

risks. Travel looks good on Friday 
and Saturday. Ask your folks for 
advice on Sunday. They may sur-
prise you. 

....,.. (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Partnerships are important this 

week. On Monday and Thesday 
emphasis is on work-related part-
nerships, as in finding somebody 
to help you. Working a trade is 
best; hire only if necessary. On 
Wednesday or Thursday you could 
be invited to partner WIth some-
body else. Once technical difficul-
ties are cleared up, that could 
work. Wait until Friday to sign. 
Finances look better then and on 
Saturday. Save Sunday for your 
loved ones. Move slowly and care-
fully all week. 

........ (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Y9ur workload is intense again 

this week. You're feisty Monday 
and Thesday, but don't be distract-
ed by your playmates. Instead, fine-
tune your routine so it'll go like 
clockwork on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Focus on service then 
and do more than ever before. You 
may get help from a partner - or 
even an enemy - on Friday and 
Saturday. Pine-tune your proce-
dures on Sunday 10 preparation for 
next week. 

c ...... (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
You should be in a cuddly 

mood this week. Fix things up

those days off. You'll be in work 
mode on Friday and Saturday. A 
partnership agreement, the forever 
kind, could happen on purpose on 
Sunday. 

........ (Jan. 2O-Feb. 18) 
Home and family demand most 

of your attention this week. Study 
on Monday and Tuesday; you11 
learn most quickly then. You11 be 
busy at home on Wednesday and 
Thursday. You'll find more time to 
play on Friday and Saturday. 
Schedule the big party for then. 
Save the cleanup for Sunday. Even 
it could be fun .

Studying is your theme this 

week. On Monday and Tuesday

wealthy. It couldn't happen 10 a 
nicer ~rson, so go for it.

Drunk: 
Post volleyball party 
leads to run-in with cops 

miliar with their ways. Seeing the 
Long Beach address on my license. 
one of the officers asked me where 
I was "originally· from. 

"New Zealand, man: I replied. 
"I'm just up visiting friends at one 
of the fraternity houses and I seem 
to have taken a wrong tum." 

Baseball: 
Beaven's return to the 
mound shake)' at best 
hopes were high. 

The Tritons hopped out to a 1-
o lead in the top of the first as 
Tyler Sullivan added one to his 
team-leading RBI total. This con-
tinued until the second inning 
when the Stangs erupted like 
Vesuvius in an offensive 
surge of which the 27 
Yankees would have 
been jealous. 

Chapman scored 
22 runs and recorded 
21 hits. Every starter 
recorded at least one 
hit, and their bats were 
like magnets with an affin-
ity for 90 mph fastballs, 

The Mustangs chased Beaven 
from the mound after 2.5 innings, 
sending 19 batters to the plate and 
scoring nine runs. Tommy Sereno 
fared a little better as he held 
Chapman to two runs in the next 3 
1/3. 

The onslaught continued in the 
seventh when Thton Blaine Vernon 
came in to pitch. He faced eight 
batters and allowed eight runs and 
recorded no outs in his time on the 
mound. 

TIying to remedy the gushing 
wound. Brian Hinson replaced 
Vernon, but his tourniquet was too 
little, too late as the score was 
already 19-1. He allowed three 
more runs. 

The Mustangs that caused the 
most damage in the first game 
were third baseman Eric Albright 
and first baseman Scott 
Montgomery, who each had six 
RBis. 

The Tritons were misfiring on 
all cylinders in the first game. Not 
only was their pitching being 
destroyed, but their defense com-
mitted five errors, allowing 10 

Monday, May 1, 2000 

The officer gave me a look over. 
"Well, you're on the wrong side 

of town, and you really should be 
more careful,· one of the officers 
said. 

I. then, managed to convince 
them to help me out and give me a 
lift down to my destination. They 
eventually gave in, telling me to 
make sure to tell all my friends that 
not everyone is rotten in the LAPD. 

They dropped me off by the 
house, and we said our goodbyes. 
So, I am here to say that there are 
nice officers in the LAPD, or at least 

unearned runs. On the offensive 
side of the ball. UCSD could man-
age only one run on five hits. 

Between games, Head Coach 
Dan O'Brien was livid, going on a 
tirade the likes of which Billy 
Martin would appreciate. 

"!The speech! really fired up the 
~uys,· Cremidan said. "I was warm-
109 up so I didn't hear it, but every-
one played with a lot more intensi-
ty that second game." 

Cremidan was the pitcher in 
that second game and went seven 

strong innings, allowing only 
one run on four hits. His 
teammates helped him 
out in the third inning 

by giving him a two-
run lead that he 
would never relin-

quish. 
"I was just trying to do 

my job and pick up my 
team,· Cre:midan said. 

He certainly did an excellent 
job. 

The Triton bats were lively in 
this second game, recording 10 hits 
along with four doubles. Chad 
Addison had three RBis on 3-4 hit-
ting and also scored two runs. 
Chris Tallman added two more 
RBis on 2-4 hitting. 

The defense committed two 
errors and did not allow any earned 
runs as the Tritons cnded up on 
top 6-1. 

With the regular season nearing 
its end and the playoffs on the 
horizon, the Tritons are hoping for 
a playoff berth. 

Assistant Coach Brian Priebe 
had this to say about the Tritons' 
chances to make the playoffs: 
"They are a little bit shady because 
of our losses to Hayward and 
Claremont last week. If we sweep 
through the tournament next 
weekend. you never know what 
could happen.· 

This tournament is being held 
at UCSD next weekend, so go and 
support your team and watch their 
last home games of the year.

Softball Team Back on 
Track With Three Wins 
Cal Lutheran, Point Lorna cure Triton losing ills 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team 
rebounded from two losses to USD 
a few weeks ago with three: wins 
last week. 

The Thtons downed California 
Lutheran University in two games 
on Saturday and split a pair against 
Point Loma on Thesday. 

In the first game against Cal Lu, 
a 6-0 victory, Leta Harlan com-
manded the mound for the Thtons. 

Harlan pitched a one-hitter in 
the: complete victory. She also 
helped by ga~ering two hits at the 
plate and sconng three runs. 

·She had good pitch selection,· 
said Head Coach Patti Gerckens. 
·On the: mound, she was very 
much in control. Cal Lu is a good 
hitting team,· 

The game was not all Harlan, 
however - her teammates were 
essential in keeping Cal Lu off the 
board. 

Thtoll catcher Kristin H unstad 
played a big role behind the plate. 

·Kristin did a tremendous job,· 
Gerckens said. ·She's like a brick 
wall back thue. She doesn't let 
anything ge:t by: 

The 'ffitons scored four runs in 
the third inning to propel them-
selves to victory. 

The second game against Cal 
Lu was not as easily won as the 
first, but the Thtons were eventual-
ly victorious 4-3 after extra innings. 

Erin Aanigan started the game 
and allowed two runs on four hits 
in 4 113 innings. Harlan came on in 
relid and tossed 4 2/3 innings, 

allowing one hit and one run. She 
struck out six. 

Cal Lu jumped out to a 2-0 lead 
in the third inning. but UCSD 
scrapped bad with a run each in 
the fourth and fifth innings. tying 
the game. 

The contest then went to the 
international tie-breaker rule. The 
two teams exchanged runs in the 
eighth inning before the deciding 
ninth frame. 

Cynthia Sam was p1accd on sec-
ond for UCSD to swt the inning 
and was moved over to third on a 
saaifice bunt by Samantha Hayes. 
Erin Bridges doubled, scoring Sam 
and giving UCSD a one-run advan-
tage. Cal Lu was unable to score in its 
half of the: ninth inning and UCSD 
took home the doubleheader. 

·We came from behind and 
won,· Gcrclcens said. MWe fought 
back and never pvc up. It was a 
total team effort. 

In earlier action, UCSD faced-
off against Point Loma Nazarene 
University. 

The Tritons won the first game: 
2-1 but wert not as successful in 
the second, getting blasted 6-0. 

Min the second game, we didn't 
hit as well,· Gcrclcens said. "We 
were hitting. just not scoring. We 
weren't getting people into posi-
tion. We made some errors on the 
field that hurt us. We had our 
chances." 

UCSD finishes up the regular 
season at home. Biola University 
comes for a visit on Wednesday at 5 
p.m. and Claremont Univeristy 
comes to town on Saturday for a 
game at noon.

. Memorie-s of their playing days

these student athletes. 

MEvery sin$le year is a totally

said. "I think the way the play-
offs were this time, I'll never for-
get it. I think the championship 
and playoff time was the most 
amazing. Never before had we to 
go to shoot-outs. It was fantas-

This last national champi-

intrigue to satisfy a million title 
runs. has a finn prace in these four

kicks. a year before in a playoff 
game, it was the same situation,· 
Hetland said. "We didn't come 
back. We 1051. What was great 
about this year is that we came 
back with a goal and then won in 
penalty kicks.· 

Hetland grew over the years 
at the goal keeper position , 
eventually earning the starting 
spot outright in her sophomore 
year 

"[Hetland! played sparingly 
her first year and came in as a 
starter and did extremely well ,~ 
McManus said. "She got better 
over her four years. Without her 
in the final and semifinal we 
would have never won the 
championship. To win champi-
onships, you expect great 
saves." 

In addition to all of the success 
on the field, tht:se girls have 
enjoyed much success in the 

classroom, their primary reason 
for attending school. 

"The academics are first, first 
and foremost,~ McManus said . 
"We practice around that. We 
don't get some of the same 
breaks as other Division III 
schools. This school is purely 
academic.· 

It was not always smooth sail-
ing for these student athletes who 
must balance so many different 
things in their lives. 

"It was very hard at times,· 

"Every single year is a 
totally different year in 
soccer. I think the way 
the playoffs were this 
time, I'll never forget 
it. I think the 
championship and

fantastic. "

Hetland said. "Brian is very under-
standing if you couldn't go to 
practice if you had a big test. The 
professors were also understand-
ing." 

To go along with this year's 
title trophy, Harispe was named 
to the 1999-2000 GTE 
Academic All-American 
Women's FalllWinter At-Large 
Team. 

"One of the things that bene-
fited me was that I had to learn 
how to really manage my time,· 
Harispe said. : On top of soccer 
and school I had work. 

SPORTS 19 

Sometimes you have to make 
sacrifices, but I think winning 
three national championships is 
worth it. Coach was very under-
standing. He knew that acade-
mics were number one. That 
helped out a lot.n 

Harispe made an immediate 
impact. 

"Janine came in and played as 
a freshman,· McManus said. 
MShe's probably one of the 
steadiest players we have had 
here." 

As for Scheese. who is graduat-
ing despite still having a year of 
eligibility left, McManus sees 
something extra special not all of 
his players possess. 

"Emily Scheese. If I could put 
her attitude and frame of mind 
in the other 17 players on the 
squad, we would win every year,n 
McManus said . ·She never, ever 
gives you less than 100 percent. 
Emily didn't always get a lot of 
playing time, but when she went 
on the field she went 100 miles 
an hour. She's got one of the 
best attitudes I've had [on the 
team!." 

Their time and adventures at 
UCSD are something these young 
women will carry with them wher-
ever they go. 

"I had the time of my life,· 
Hetland said. "It's the best time I 
ever had. I made some great 
friends and ( had a wonderful 
coach." 

Fun on and off the field were 
what the years together was all 
about. 

"I don't think I've felt so 
proud and well -rewarded and 
just overwhelmed,· Schilling 
added . "It's sometl:1ing you just 
can't describe, and I hope that 
every athlete gets an opportunity 
to feel that way sometime in their 
life. It's the greatest reward you 
can have."

An Intersorority 
Volleyball Adventure 

The weather's heating up, the 
flowers are blooming and the 
beaches are packed. This can only 
mean one thing - spring is upon 
us, and with the advent of spring 
comes an event that is important to 
drunks all over California. 

T he Interso rority Volleyball 
Tournament brought thousands to 
the warm sands of my hometown 
of Long Beach. The event suppos-
edly centers around a competition 
that pits sororities in head-to-head 
volleyball action. However, the 
whole time I was there, I don't 
think that any actual games 
occurred, as the throng on the 
beach was more interested in 
drinking as many stiff cocktails as 
possible out of paper cups, myself 
included. 

Drinking all day in the sun 
eventually wears one down and 
since swimming in the toxic ocean 
was out of the question, I suggest-
ed heading back to the pool at my 
crib. 

My parents were a bit surprised 
to open the door to see 20 intoxi-
cated kids stumbling up the front 
walk, but good old mom took it all 
in stride. Seeing that we were obvi-
ously parched from all our spectat-
ing, she rummaged through the 
cabinets and produced a beautiful 
bo ttle of Smirnoffs Sil ver to 
quench our thirsts. 

The next few hours were spent 
lounging poolside, sipping vodka 
and washing it down with swigs 
from the ubiquitous L.B. staple, the 
St. Ides 40. 

When I came to, we were head-
ing up the 40S freeway, and I was at 
the wheel. The sun was setting and 
we were ready for the second pan 
of the festivities - the panies at 
UCLA. Parking the car, I wandered 
off and was soon by myself and 
totally lost. I took a few wrong 
turns and soon found myself high 
in the hills in one of Los Angeles' 
ritziest neighborhoods. 

I had been traveling for some 
time. removing my shin to cool off, 
and had also somehow acquired a 
pink balloon, which was tied to my 
belt and bobbed along behind me. 
My weird apparel surely had some-
thing to do with what happened 
next. 

I had stopped to gather my 
thoughts in the front yard of a 
huge Bel Air home, replete with six 
expensive cars in the driveway. I 
turned around to see a man emerge 
from the door, brandishing a gun 
and heading my way. [ muttered 
something and took off down the 
hill, fearing for my life. 

Soon after, while walking along 
the street at the bottom of the hill, 
a cop car blared its lights and 
pulled over beside me at the bot-
tom of the road. Apparently the 
police had gotten some calls from 
homeowners complaining about a 
shirtless drunk with a balloon wan-
dering haphazardly through traffic 
and harassing people. Since I fit the 
description [ was subjected to a 
frisking and had my license 
scanned for warrants. 

For some reason, I thought it 
would be a good idea to adopt a 
foreign accent when dealing with 
the police, as perhaps they would 
take it easy on someone so unfa-

UCSD Suffers Embarrassing Loss to Chapman 
Tritons fall to the kfustangs 22-1 in first game of doubleheader, rebound to win second game 6-1 
By TAIT •• LUII 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons ran the gamut of 
baseball emotion on Saturday as 
they traveled to Orange to face 
the Chapman Mustangs in a 
doubleheader. 

On what was a beautiful day 
for baseball, the Tritons looked 
like meek mice in the first game, 
going down 22-t. They might as 
well have been a scared-hitless 
single-A club playing the 
Yankees. 

The second game was a dif-
ferent story, however, as the 
solid pitching of Alex 
Cremidan helped UCSD take 
Chapman 6- t . 

The first game staned out 
innocuously as the grass was 
freshly cut and the players were 
out on the sort of day for which 
baseball was invented. 

_ . John Beaven, in what the 
Thtons hoped would be the 
beginning of a strong come-
back, was making his second 
start back from injury and
