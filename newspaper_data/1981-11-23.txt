Cheating: the easy way out ofUCSD 

Inside: • CIa hover Ragan • Roundup of A bu ine 

BY CARMELITA ROSAL 
Procrastination will take it· toll next week dunng 

finals . Lnfmished term paper' \\'ill cause anxIety, and 
those who cannot cope with the stre . may decide to 
cheat. 

What will happen to those who take this "easy" way 
out? Or rather, what should happen to them? 

"Any action which is completely punitive defeats its 
purpo. e," says Brook Neilson , Warren Colleg( Writmg 
Program DIrector. 

" It i not constru tive to expulse a ... tudent from 
college, especially a freshman , for an act of plagian m. 
On the oth r hand, it i. disappomting to ob. erve the 
cavalier attitude .ome tudents are takmg toward 
plagiari. m and cheating," Neil on add". 

When a student at C D is found guilty of cheating or 
plagiari. m, the fir t offen'e IS handled by mean. of 
di. ciplinary censure. 

A formal letter, whIch contam. detaIl.' of the 
administrative action again t the. tudellt, i . I. olated In 
a file from hi or her academic record . The ca. e remams 
in a ealed file which i not a part of the tudent sregular 
record. 

The second offense however, mvolves a critIcal course 
of action . Record of t he act becomes a permanenl part of 
Ihe student' record . 

"Any kind of dl ciplinary action \~ hlch il1\ ol\e an 
inItial offen'ie such a., cheating or plaglan ... m I not just a 
' lap on th . tudent's hand," sa) ErnIe ;\10r , Re\elle

Reagan has his 
first good idea 

One does not really know whether to trust his 
motives or not. But President Ronald Reagan 's 
proposal to withdraw all intermediate·range nuclear 
weapons from Western and Eastern Europe must be 
met with applause. 

In his first major foreign policy address, Reagan 
proposed last week to forego deployment of NATO 
mi ile in 1983 if the Soviets do not deploy their SS· 
20 mis ile , 

The prima~y and political reson for- this move is 
obviou . Reagan's policie toward NATO, Western 
Europe, and the Soviet Union have been received very 
poorly over in Europe. Anti·war demon tration ' in 
West Germany, Italy, Au tria and the Netherlands 
are increasing at a feveri 'h pace. Anti·US and anti· 
Reagan sentiment i strong. Reagan's di armament 
pro po al is, first and foremost. an attempt to dispel 
some of thi ' sentiment and re tore American 
cedibility among political leaders in Europe. 

The Soviet Union i well aware of this fact. Their 
re 'pon e to Reagan's speech wa , to say the least, 
cool. They appear to be u picious of Reagan's 

incerity, e pecially con idering the militant anti· 
Soviet attitude taken by the Reagan administration 
these past ten month. They did, however, 'ay that 
they would be willing to discus the pro po al at the 
US·Soviet arms talks in Geneva next month. 

As Americans, we s hould also question the true 
intent of this apparent s hift in Reagan foreign policy. 
But we should also be thankful that the Reagan 
administration is at least considering the value of a 
strong disarmament policy. We must let Reagan and 
the Congress know: the arms race must be halted and 
reversed. 

As this month's nuclear convocations taught us, all 
other problem of the world have no meaning if nuclear 
war becomes a reality. Reagan has taken the first 
positive tep of his Pre idency towards halting the 
madness. He must not be allowed to back away from 
this step forward .

For God's sake, Papa Joe Kennedy was a booze 
runner from way back. Notice how easy it is to 
forgive JFK? The affairs? The unhappiness? These 
arc the excesses of a brilliant, viri le man . Forgivable, 
in light of America's need for heroes . He was our boy. 
Ted Kenned y is not our boy . Bobby might have been. 
But. John was everything, Or was he? 

The Reagans learned well from the Ken nedy 
example of Whit e House protocol. Since Kennedy, no 
American president has ent hralled us wit h class and 
dignit y. A tuxedo, wit h a top hal. a man, not only to 
run the country, but who also represented America 
with first rate sty le and class. LBJ rode in on a cow, 
and showed us his scar. Ford fell down every chance 
he cou ld get, and made ridiculous sta tem ents in 
debate. Carter was peanuts, a sure loser once wegot 
to kno", him. And Nixon". 

Unfortunately, the Reagans haven't yet 
succeeded . Nancy has ordered new dishes. The 
White HclUsc isgett ing some interior decorat ing. But 
it 's not t he same. We're too aware that money is 
being wasted in hard times. It 's rather caustic to 
admit. but. Nancy Reagan hasn't the breeding of 
Jacquelrne Bouvier Kennedy. Reagan rides a horse, 
as we're too often reminded. but on ly sardonic, 
satirical cartoonists seem to care. Remember the 
picture of JFK on the beach. shirtless, suntan, slim 
and muscular, surrounded by adoring women and 
chi ldren? Reagan can't do that. His makeup would 
fall off. Hi s teeth would slip, They try so hard to

pre\'ented the legacy from contlllu1l1g. 

But, t hen again, ask any political scient i"t and 
I hey will tell you that JFK was not a model 
president. Bay of Pigs is the most readily available 
example. Some people have never forgiven Kennedy 
for risking nuclear w'ar in the Cuban missile crisis. 
A 50/ 50 chance of nuclear holocaust is not the time 
to assert pride, some helieve. We were yeball to 
eyeball with Ihe Russians, but what If Ihey didn't 
blink? we'd be living in a very different world, if at 
all. 

1)0 we really want a JFK? 
Some time ago I read a novel entitled "Joshua , Son 

of None". In it, a sampleofJFK'sskin is taken before 
he dies, and then cloned into another JFK. Scientist · 
and polit icians then recreated JFK 's I ife as closely as 
possible. They inflicted specific pains. They took 
away an older brot her. They gave him spinal/back 
trouble. They even staged PT· 109 type incident in 
space. in which the newJFK could become a national 
hero, The young man eventually discoverh what he 
is and reveals to the world that he isJFK's done. 
America elec[s him president. After his inaugural 
speech he is shot. and killed, again. The end. 

At the time, it was an emotionally c1i"appointing 
ending to a "good idea" Ix)()k. Fi ve years later, I've 

reali~ecl the IX)int. It wasn't done hCl'au"e we needed 
another JFK. It was done because we needed [0 lose 
another JFK. We needed to have, and then lose, 
anot her leader. That's the set 'up, as morbid a" it 
seems. 

Every twenty years since 1940, we've lost a 
pre~ident while in office - four. maybe five, by 
assassination. The most dramatic examples of this 
are Lincoln , FOR , and ]FK. It 's a tragic. worrying, 
and tiring fact. that hopefully will he broken and

Roundup of AS business 
BY LISA LLIVAN 
News Assignment Editor 

The fot/owillg article is a 
wrap·up of some AS business 
taken care of this quarter. 

CWD 
At last Wed nesday' AS 

meeting, co un ci l member 
David Tollner proposed that a 
task force of four counci l 
members be appoi nted to look 
into viable alternat ives and 
compromi es on CWO' · 
controver s ial budget of 
$12,500. 

The council rejected hi!> 
proposal however. and decided 
instead to urge interested 
members to contact CWO 

members informally, and 
di sc u ss their concerns 
regarding the frequency of 
films and budgeting. 

' 'I'm ick an d tired of 
wa ting time on this issue ," 
said one cou ncil member. 
Other member agreed that 
the CounCIl has pent too 
much time discussing CWO' 
budget, without resolving 
anything. However, Tollner 
and a few others felt that the 
great amount of student 
concern on the issue warrant 
more attention from the 
Council. 

Warning to Tollner 
AS Cou ncil member Reggie 

Williams is ued a warning to 
David Tollner that in the 
future he should not u e A 
fund ' to place advertisements 
of a controversial nature. 
Williams was referring to two 
114 page ads that Tollner 
recently placed in The 
Guardian to solicit ignatures 
for his campaign again t the 
funding of CWO, 

The Council con:"idered -
but vo ted again ' t 
sponsoring an "equal·time" ad 
for CWO. In stead. they 
decided to subtract Ihe $50 
cost of the ad from Tollner's 
commission budget of $100.

Carlos Valdivia, a member

Students, Cuban refugees 
disagree on Reagan politics 

An unidentified woman walked the picket line to protest 
American intervention in El Salvador. The protes t and the 
counter-protest - in which nearly 100 people participated -
was d escribed by the an Diego wliee as "raucous but 
peaceful." 

BY TARYN HIGASHI 
Two years ago the 

Committee on Educati onal 
Policy (CEP) established the 
"W" policy , a drop option 
which allows UCSD students 
to withdraw from a class from 
the fourth until the ninth 
week of the quarter. 

Some students fear that the 
"W" policy - which puts a 
"W" next to the dropped class 
on the student's transcript -
will effect their chances of 
getting into a graduate school. 

Moreover, President Jules 
Bagneris feels that strict 
enforcement of the "W" policy 
is unfair si nce some tudents 
don't receive a midterm grade 
until the fourth week - after 
the "W" policy takes effect. 
"These students should not be

Bagneris said . " It is 1I0t wrong 
for s tudents to base their 
decision on whether or not 
they want to remain in a cia s

Dr. Lea Rudee, Warren 
College Provost. believes that 
academic performance should 
not be a factor in a student's 
decision to drop a class. "r 
don 't think a drop policy 
should be a grade lottery," 
Rudee said. 

Furthermore, both Rudee 
and Tom Bond , a chemistry 
professor and the chairman of 
the CEP two year ago do noL 
believe that the "W" policy 
will effect a tudent's chances 
of getting enrolled in a 
graduate chool. " If a LudenL 

has an occa,;lOnal \'" you 
never even notICe It " Rudee 
said. refenng to hiS experience 
reviewing Graduatechool 
applications. 

Bond explained the CEP's 
reason for e tablishing the 
"W" policy. "Few, if any, 
school s with out tanding 
academic reputations require 
evaluation prior to their drop 
date. The purpose of the 
change was to protect the 
integrity of the tran cript and 
of UCSD's academic reputa-
tion," Bond said. 

In comparison to orne UC 
colleges, UC O' drop policies 
are omewhat lenient. At C 
Berkely and UC Lo ' Angele 
drops after the fourth week are 
not all owed under any 
circum ' tances.

AS Council 
roundup

Tollrll'r him~e lf \'oted in fm'or 
of t his action. 

K OT 
The AS Council may vote 

tonight on whet her to unfreez 
cam pus radio sta tion KSDT's 
orig inal budget of about 
$10,000. 

After investigating the 
sta t u: of KSDT, the AS 
Fin ance Committee ha s 
decided to recommend that the 
originally allocated budget be 
reins tated. 

KSDT's budget was frozen 
last summer when the station 
was found to be broadcasting 
on-campL!S with a transmitter 
atop Tioga Hall that violated 
FCC regulations. 

KSDT officials believe 
another rea so n the AS 
temporarily froze their budget 
wa ' becau e of an interview 
the tat ion broadcast in July 
with Ku Klux Klan grand 
dragon Tom Metzger_ 

Since the budget freeze. 
KSDT officials have looked 
into alternative methods of 
broa d casti ng legally on· 
cam pu . They al 0 ha ve 
asse 'sed the value of their 
equipment. as requested by 
the Council. 

KSDT Advi sor Linda Saba 
said. "At t his point KSDT has 
done everything that they 
were told to do. No·.v the 
burden of proof i on the AS 
Council as to why KSDT 
sho uld not receive their 
originally allocated budget." 

According to Saba, there 
sti ll are no easy solutions to 
actualizing on-campus 
transmission . The s tation can 

, contin ue to broadcast on AM 
carrier current 540. she said . 
but the system is in need of 
much improveme n t. Th e 
signal i. not clear and crisp, 
and wou ld requi re a high level 
of maintenance to mak it 
audible, she . aid. 

A frequency search was 
conducted to find out what 
bands were available in San 
Diego, but no free bands were 
found. "Therefore." said Saba, 
"it would be unreasonable for 
K DT to apply for a FCC 
license right now." 

One option that KSDTcould 
pursue, however. is extending 
their present cable system into 
the dorms on campus. This 
would be expens ive though. 
and would require assistance 
from the uni ve r si ty 's 
administration with financ-
ing. 

KSDT officials are al 0 
hoping to regain their budget 
so that they can purchase new 
eq uipment nece. sar y. The 
s tation needs $14.000 10 
$15,000 worth of n ew 
equipment to function more 
effi ciently. Most needed are 
amplifiers , a production board, 
and speakers on the hump in 
front of the gym so that 
broadcasts ca n be hea rd 
during the noon hour .

mainland China 

Louis Rosen, head of Los 
Alamos National Labora tory' · 
Medium Energy Ph ysics 
Division, spent two weeks 
touring China as a guest of 
The Chinese Academy of 
Science. 

Rosen . whoal 'ooverseeshi 
division 's giant, half-mile-long 
proton accelerator, Los 
Alam os Me son Physics 
Facility (LAMPF). says the 
Chinese state-of-the-art in 
nuclear- and particle-phy ic 
is obsolete and built mainly 
around three old Soviet-style 
cyclotrons, a few Van de 
Graaffs and Cockroft-Walton 
accelerators, and some low-
power nu c lear research 
reactors. Rosen says his trip is 
a good indicat ion of expanding 
international relations 
between China and the West , 
and may result in an exchange 
of scientists, with several 
Chinese physicists vis iting 
LAMPF in the future . 

After lecturing at the 
Institute of Atomic Energy, 
the Institute of High Energy 
Physics. the Instit ute of 
Modern Physics, and before 
the In ternational Clu b in 
Peking, Rosen concludes that 
the level of experimental 
sophi tication in Chine -e 
science i "not good. although 
the peopleareenthu ia tic and 
morale appears high. The 
facilities at the Institute of 
Atomic Energy in Peking are 
not very good ," Ro en says. 
" However, in theoretical 
understanding. the situation 

IS much better. In general, the 
quality of the people incience 
i very impres -ive. 

"They ha ve a quite good

They lack a computerized 
system for the cyclotron and 
for data acquisition . The low-
power reactor doe not seem to 
be much in demand , and their 
instruments for neutron 
spectroscopy need to be 
modernized ," Rosen reports. 

Rosen lectured for more 
than two hours at Peking's 
Institute for High Energy 
Physics. before a knowledge-
able audience that helped the 
official interpreter translate 
nuances of scie ntific 
terminology . This 1,000-
person Institute was charac-
terized by Ro en as "having 
hopes for thefuture that do not 
appear too bright - the lack of 
modern equipment is a -great 
drawback. Construction of a 
maj or accelerator at the 
Institute has been deferred . 
and what remains is very 
little, except for orne modern

Day Care Center

The UCSD Day Care Center 

may expand (h i year wit h the

says Josie Fou lkes, Director of 
the Center. 

Because of the recen t 
Reagan Ad ministration 
budget cu ts , government 
funding for univer s ity 
programs, such as the Day 
Care Center, are expected to be 
decreased . Through a United 
Way project set upon campus, 
the Day Care s taff hopes to 
expand its present operations 
to serve the 250 child ren who 
are currently on the waiting 
list. 

Along with the nited Way, 
students, p<tre'nts, and faculty 
members have helped fund the 
Center, 

In t he last few months,

"We want to expand wit hout

Bottle initiative 
support gro\Ving 

BY KEVIN BEST 
Californians spend , 100 

million on waste clean-up 
along the state's highways 
every year, says <In environ-
mental group, Californ ians 
Against Waste. Most of thi s 
waste is beverage bOllles and 
cans. 

But thi ~ might change if a 
can and bottle deposi t 
mitiati ve IS placed on thi s 
yea r' s referendum, says 
Stephen Haskins, a member of 
the Friends of t he Earl h. 
According to I (askin~ the can 
and bottle bill would save the 
state of California $88 million. 

However, some beverage 
corporations claim that the 
can and bottle initiati ve wi ll 
co,.'i t their compani s mon y to 
switch production toward 
r ecyc ling rather than 
manufact uring_ In ·tead of 
spending money on material s 
they ay, they would need to 
spend it on labor, which i 
more expensive. 

Nev e rthele ss, Has kin s 
belie\'es that it will cost 
alcoholic beverage companies 
less money to recycl e si nce 
companies - like Coors - go 
through a di st ribution service. 
Distribution serv ices cut the 
cost of recycling, and therefore 

make It profit able to have a 
bottle bill. 

But , non -a lcoholic com· 
panies, 'iuch as Pepsicola and 
Coca -Cola. do not have 
di stribution companies and 
must cover recycling expenses 
t hemselves_ 

So far there are 62,300 
pet it ion signatures for the 
referendum already. Approx-
Imatelv 3!)0,OOO - or 10 
perce'nt of the \ ot i ng 
populat ion - are needed to put 
the referendum on the ballot. 

Haskins be lieves that 
ge tting the rem a ining

si nce so fe\\ C D ~tudent s 
are registered voterfl in this 
cou nt y. Furthermore, Hask ins 
beli yes that 85 percent of 
Californian_ want a bot! Ie and 
can act. 

According to Haskins, his 
environmenta l organil'ation 
and the Recycling Coop - on a

UCPD tnakes suggestions 
on avoiding holiday thefts 

The followiug are h~/Pflll 
holiday sa/ely suggeslions from 
the UCPD. 

BY PETER ALBANE E 
The Uni ver it y Police 

Department wou ld like to 
extend holiday best wishes to 
all those involved in the 
University community. While 
the holiday season i a time of 
busy concerns, it is important 
that we are aware of our 
surroundin s at all times. The 

ni ve rsi ty Police Depart-
ment's Crime Prevention Unit 
suggests t hat your residence 
be extra secure during this 
holiday season. Use dead bolt 
locks to secure your exterior 
doors. If door hinges a re on the 
outside of a door, pin these 
hinges by simpl y removing 
middle !->crews from top and 
bottom hinges and hammer a 
concrete nail into the hinge 
hole on the door frame side. 
The nail should extend from 
t hi s hole no more than one-half 
inch . 

Window. ar not as difficult 
to secure as most would 
a ss ume. Sliding gla ss 
windows can be secured for 
little more than a dollar each 
by utilizing a thumb turn lock 
and a few screws_ Louvered 
wi ndow, though t to be 
Impossible to secur , can be

s e c u red again s t mo s t 
int ru,>ion by applying a t wo-
part epoxy cement to the 
sandpapered edges of each 
gla 's panel. Uouble ~ng 
windows can be secured by the 
utilization of two nail s. A 
num ber of securit y flush bolt 
devices a re avai lable for 
casement window security , 

During the holiday season, 
it is also necessa ry to 
objectively apprai se th e 
vulnerabi lit y of t he immediate 
area . urrounding yo ur 
resid ence . Ques tions you 
hou ld ask yourself include: 
-Does the hrubber y 

around my re idence com-
promise the vi ibility of any of 
my doors and wi ndows? Cou ld 
a bu rg lar hid e in thi 
shurbbery whi le attempting to 
commit a criminal act? 

- Have I sec ured m y 
exterior electric ci rcu it box 
wi th a quality padlock? Have I 
rem mbered to remove th key 
code numbers from the bottom 
of this pad lock and all security 
padlo ks, as the duplication of 
keys relies on the 'e num ber . 

-Are mi sce llaneou s 
openings such as kylights, 
venti lation screens, crawl 
spaces, pit doors, and trap 
doors wi t h locks, grill work or 
hea vy sc reening secured? 
Note: pet doors are security 
liabilities with a num ber of 
alternative solutions, 

hurting their value. The b st 
identifi ca tion is a s t ate 
Driver. ' License number. Th 
correct method is to engrave 
s tate ahbrevia tion , ac tu al 
number of li cense and place a 
strong line after the last 
number so no new numbers 
w ill be added. Wh ere 
engravi ng is impractica l, 
photograph each item. Put 
photographs and inventory 
li sts where they will be secure 
from burglary; i.e. outside of 
t he home in a sa fe-deposit box. 

Security closets are an 
excellent way to secure items 
of value in a home on a dail y 
basis_ Such a closet must have 
a solid core door , a s ingle 
cylinder deadbolt lock and the 
possible pinning of hinges. 
While thi structure is not fail 
safe, it will clearly provide a 
formidable det erent , In 
essence, this closet becomes a 
vault in the res idence. For 
proper applica tion, do not use 
closets with windows, 

Automobile safet y is of 
primary importance through-
out the yea r , but ext ra 
precaution should beexercised 
during all holiday periods. 
Make sure au tos are in good 
repair. Due to a high'e r 
concentration of night dri ving, 
au tos s hou ld alway have 
more gas than needed, battery 
cabl should be clean and one 
shou ld always make others 
aware of destinations and 
e ·timated time of arrival 
home.

.Acceleration of evolution 
continued from pale 9 
problem solving by anticipation . The Spunik 
was not one of ten thousand which worked, not 
did it 'learn ' the correct orbit once it came up. It 
was preplanned to work and had feed ·back 
control systems and informat ion programmed 
in advanced . 

The final major development is large scale 
planning, which involves large groups of people 
working with the s ame go~1 for extended 
periods. The space program is one example of 
thi development, says Plat t. and is comparable 
to the appearance of symbolic thought as a 
mechanism for creating new changes. 

These technological developmen ts ha,,:e taken 
place in t he las t forty years whIle the 
comparable evolut iona ry development · took 
about three billion. 

Dr. Platt went on to describe characterist ics of 
these evol ut io na ry c ha nges a nd t he i r 
technolgical counterparts. 

In these changes, there are elements. of 
surprise and inevitability . Developments w hIch 
occured several times mu s t ha ve been 
inevitable. Wings, for example, were invented 
four times, by different kinds of animals: 
reptiles, birds, mammals, a.nd insects. T~at 
these very diverse groups all mvente<;l th~ wlllg 
s uggests that this development was mevl table. 

These animals are also restricted by the 
phys ical requirements of flight to develop 
basically s imilar wings. Platt likened this 
development to a valley with several streams 
flowing into a river. Though the reptiles, birds, 
mammals, and insects start on the road to wings 
from different places, they all end up, like the 
s treams, at the same place, because only certain 
structures will work as wings. Tt)e element of 
s urprise is whether mammals, for ins tance, will 
develop wing or not. Once they have begun 
however, the shape of the wing is inevitable 
because of aerod ynamic laws. . 

The unspoken quest ion in discussions such as 
this is "Wh y?" Wh at is the cause of these 
evolutionary development ? Platt pointed out 
three traditional explanations. 

autupoesis. frum the (;rcek (/lIto- self. and 
poies- to make. Autopoct ic. or self made change 
refl ects the abilit y to respond to realit y. The 
modern technologica l advances a re examples of 
aut opoetic change in which men rcsponded to 
a nd changed a given realit y. 

• There is a requirement for changes to sca le 
up. Multicellular organi 'ms mu st exi s t before 
eyes are possible. A literate popula tion mus t 
exist before newspapers a re possi ble. Cha nges 
must build on previous cond it ions, tha t is they 
must scale up. 

Changes have a tend ncy to speed up. A . more 
changes are made. things change faster wh ich 
makes for even more and fas ter cha nges. Th ree 
ways th ey can speed up ar e (I) •. ub· 
exponent ia lly, (2) exponentia lly, and (3) super· 
exponentially. Sub'ex ponent ial changes start 
speeding up, get very fas t and then slow back 
down. Exponent ial changes occur fas ter and 
fas ter, speeding up as they go. Biological 
populat ion g rowth is an exponential change . 

S uper ·ex po ne nt ia l changes are l ike 
ex ponential changes onl y more so. When they 
·tart , they change even fas ter than exponential 

changes. 
Pregnancy, says Platt , is an example of a 

s uper·exponentia, change. The difference 
bet ween t he first and second days of pregnancy 
are very small . As the pregnancy advances, the 
change from day to day become greater. In the-
las t few hours of pr~nancy , the changes are 
tremendous. In the las t minutes there is more 
change in 60 seconds than in the firs t 60 days. 
Things happen fas ter and fas ter until finall y ... a 
bir th. 

The change in our world today is super· 
exponential says Platt. Changes that previously 
took eons ha ve been wrought in the las t fort y 
years. We are faced with incredibly fas t change, 
a nd our onl y met hod for dealing with th is 
problem is .ant icipation in which we apply 
previous experience to the future. 

Our situation, according to Plalt, is li ke 
floating down a river toward a waterfa ll. We 
can't stop the river, and we can't go again t t he 
current. We can, however. move between the 
banks and hope to find some way out of the fix .

Shades of Ian Hunter 
The life and times of a veteran rocker 

BY JOHN HOUSTON 
The Golden Age of Rock and Roll will never die, 
as loug as ch ildren feel the need to laugh and 
cry ... 

- Ian Hun ter, 1974 

Rock and roll vetera n Ian Hunter played here 
last month to a small but enthusia tic crowd of 
college fans. Twelve years ago Hunter began 
performing wi th the talented group, Matt the 
Hoople, and SIX years later began his solo 
career. Aft er the concert I spoke with Hunter 
about hi , tragic out look on being a rock and roll 
tar. 

In the late sixties, an English group !lamed 
Molt auditioned a charismatic lead singer 
named Ian Hunter who performed .a Dylan 
ba ll ad with a heavy British accent and a 
sandpaper voice. They hired Ian much to his 
surprise, renamed the group Mott the Hoople. 
and enjoyed a sporadically successful career 
until Hunter's split with the group In 1975. 

Hunter earned t he right to wear the 
sunglasse of a star and began writing 
bitler:weet songs and intense lyrical rock 

Live 

ballads. The band rarely provided Hunterwith 
accompanime nt that met the standards of his 
work. Even after the first few a lbums when 
Mott was mild ly succe sful, Hunter only 
received about fourteen dollars a week, so he 
nabbed albums from h is record company, 
Is land, and sold them to make enough to live 
on. 

Hott the Hoople released Mott in 1973, their 
best a lbum. and rose to stardom on both side 
of the water. They became the first rock and 
roll group to play Broadway, a how which 
~pened with a little known band called Queen. 

ext year the group released their la t original 
track on The Hoople and crossed the Stat es 
with a tour called "The Golder. Age of Rock and 
Roll. " 

San Diego 's concert was a short but sweet 90 
minute et made up of an array of ongs which 
spanned Hunter's career. Rumor has it that 
Hunter grew fru strated and fired his band, 

. including the legendary Mick Ronson, who 
achieved fame as David Bowie's g~itari. t, and

week. While it unearth some 
treasure, the Sprocketls 
approach tends to be hIt or 
miss - some of its forgotten 
films deserve to stay forgotten. 

More intere ting is Matinee 
at the Bijou (Fridays at noon), 
which set out to recreate a 
typical 1930s movie afternoon. 
Thus we are given a cartoon, 
reviews, assorted promotional 
nonsen e like "Personalities 
on Parade" (Hollywood tar 
being goofy on their spare 
time) and various specialized 
me age (a reward being 
offered to point out the theatre 
patron who is damaging the 
seats). Naturally, this doesn't 
leave much time for the 
feature film, but that's no 
problem. becau e these are 
what were called "program· 
mers" : poverty· row quickie 
which rarely exceeded 65 
minutes in length . 

The feature on a recent 
Matinee at the Bijou wa The 
Vampire Bat (1933). a very 
short (in both time - 45 
minute . and plot) Dracula! 
Frankenstein hybrid which 
starred Melvyn Douglas as the 
hero and Lionel At will as the 
villian . The film 's major virtue 
proved to be the performance 
of Dwight Frey, in one of hiS 
patented characterizations of 
a deranged, dimwitted , 
pat het ic man obsessed wi th 
some sort of sma ll animal life 
- in Dran!la it was flies. here 
it's (what else?) bats. Ice 
lady.givemeapple,"he aysto 

a benefactress. "Here. have 
nice. soft bat. " The Vampie Bat 
also starred Fay Wray as a 
lady in distress, another bit of 
typecastinl!. 

Preceding The Vampire Bat 
was Chapter 7 of The Phantom 
Empire (1935), an emertaining 
pace (well , innerspace) opera 

s imilar to the more famous 
Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers 
serial but s tarring inging 
cowboy Gene Autry (!). The 
action (and there's plenty of it) 
takes place in the kingdom of 
Muritania , located thousands 
of feet below the earth 's 
surface with an entrance not 
far from Autry's " Radi o 
Ranch ." een today, the erial 
eems at once hokey and 

clumsy - Muritania employs 
robots which make the Tin 
Woodsman look like Rudolph 
Nureyev - and remarkable 
prescient with its "radium 
bombs" and "atom· rna hing 
machine." Mostly, though, it's 
ju t plain fun. 

This paticular matinee wa 
al 0 highlighted by the 
appearance of the cartoon ' 
flapper extraordinalre. Betty 
Boop. Betty Boop 's Rise to Fame 
demonstrated her brilliant 
creator/ producer Max Flei · 
scher's "Out of the Inkwell "

promot IOn for an adventure

The past, the present and 
the future for Ian Hunter 
continue d from page 13 
hired a group of no·names a 
few weeks before an Diego, 
Unfortunat e ly th e new 
key boardi t had a cerebral 
hemorage in New Orleans, '0 
Hun ter asked Mick to ret urn 
to the tour and play keyboards, 

The show opened with 
Hunter's fi rst solo song, "Once 
Bitten T wice Shy" foll owed by 
h is la t e tong, "G un 
Con trol," a sarcastic number 
playing devit's advocate to the 
NRA. Hunter's abilit y. to sing 
Dylan mesmerized the crowd 
with his rendi tion of " I: Your 
Love in Vain" performed with 
Hunter playing harmonica. 
~()nson finally stood up from 
behind theelectricbabygrand, 
picked up a green st riped 
custom axe, and casua lly 
treated the aud ience with the 
slow leads that have given him 
[am as one of the truly great 
guitarists. 

Hunter began to look like a 
mirage through his inging 
and r wondered if all J wa 
seeing was a silhouet teo I 
looked at the two dimensional 
shadow left by the spotlight 
and remembered all the litt le 
bit s of ro c k and ro ll 
disill us ionment that Hunter 
tempered his ongs with. I 
realized th~t Hunter was just 
putt ing on a show. that maybe 
in the past he had poured out 
his tragic views to audiences 
with his ballad , but the San 
Diego concert was just a 
reflect ion of a rock star, that 
which the audience wa nted to 
see. 

Hunt er's writt en ~() man ~' 
songs about \'iolen e that '1 
figured he must have some 
experience. T he crowd went 
beserk wit h the unt amed rock 
cla s ' ic, "Viole nce," and 
emotion surged through the 
audience and back onto st'ftge. 
Hav ing a s us picion th at 
Hunt er migh t have belonged to 
the Englis h street ga ng scene 
in the post war fif t ies, l showed 
him a pict ure of a Teddy Boy, a 
worki ngclass youth who spent

Hunter \\ a~ surprised and :-.aid 
that he had bee n a "Teel" when 
he was t \\'elve, got ten in to a 
few brawls and the like. T he 
Teddy Boys were a trend in 
\'iolence in Engla nd before the 
Moos a nd Rockcr", work ing· 
class teenagers from the 
poorer dist ricts who banded 
together in violen t dema nd of 
social sl al us. 

As a little di\'ersion, 1 asked 
Hunter about the movie A li£'(' 
Ducsil', Lil'!' H ere AI/I'll/urI', 
which llpen ~ wit h a Ijrcteen 
putting on on of Hunter's . 
mu,t famous numbers, "All

turns out that tht' daughlcr of 
the produc r of the movi 'liked 
the song so much she asked 
her dad to use it In t he movie. 
Hunter hasn 't c\en seen the 
movie and says he doesn't need 
to, he's heard so much about it. 

This art ic le follows with a 
discography of Hunter's work, 
incl uding the boot leg ' that 
were illega ll y r ecorded at

Hunter mentioned that Mot t 
the Hoople ' founder and 
manager, Guy Stephens, had 
died a few weeks earlier. 
Hunter has been in contact 
with the other member of 
Mott the Hoople and said tha t 
they might perfarm once again 
in memory of Guy.

Ultimat e Bowl. 

Th e qu a rt e rfin a l s o f

On Sa turd ay th e fir s t 
quarterfi nal games ma tched 
Te nn esce Spi nners (a li as 
Victims of Gravity) aga inst 
Dilated Pupi ls and Delayed 
Reaction against Hernia ted

who was missing one of their

fell to Delayed 8·7. 

In the other two quarter·

Senior Sl:Iff Write r 
Ra rely in th is univer it y's history has a team enjoyed as much 

success and a t tracted a large a loyal following as has this year 's 
UCSD women 's volleyball team. 

Composed a lmo t ent irely of fres hmen a nd sophomores (t here 
are only two juniors and no seniors on th team) the T ritons 
soundly trounced every league opponent this ea on and finis hed 
with an overa ll record of 33-8. 

Th Tri ton '· major achievemen t of the year may have been 
their abil ity to hold the n umber on e ran king in the NCAA every 
week the polls came out. "We·had a grea t season," said head 
roach a nd prj nc ipal architect of lh squad , Doug Dannevik. 

And it was great. The spikers s howed character all season by 
beating many NCAA Div ision I and II schools. by often coming 
from behind to w in, and by always hust ling. 

But strange as it may seem, thing were not always this rosie . 
There was some question at the beginning of the season as to 
how competitive the Tritons would be. Returning from last 
year's team were only three players, Loui e (Lulu) Schwartz, 
Michele Whitmore and Vickie Pride. To make malleI'S worse. 
there wa: all that you/h . 

"We really didn ' t know how good we were until the La Verne 
Tournament (in late September)," said Dannevik. "Then, wh n 
we beat Azuza Pacific. t he defending AlA champs, in three 
straight games. we knew we were good ." 

rollo\\ 109 the victory o\'er Azusa. the ..;p ikers went on a 
\It'lory spree that saw them w in 23 of their next 26 games. 
During t he rampage UC D won the Occid ntal College 
Tournament championship, crushed Azuza again, and then 
finished a ~urpri~ing ~econd at th 'ir own UCSD Invitational 
meet. 

Leadi ng the team this season were last year's returning 
'\eterans" plus a host of talent ed newcomers, including Tammy 
Smil, who led the spikers with 251 kill s and a .320 s lugging 
percentage, Maril yn Horn, a paragon of consistency, a nd Kri s tin 
Kilbourn. who WilS second on th tea m with 192 kills. 

Although the Tritons finished theIr regular season w ith a loss 
10 San Diego State. they attracted more than 1.000 people into 
the main gym for the contest. a rema rkable feat for any team at 
\'CS D. 

The s piker' s season began in early eptembcr and it will end 
four weeks from now in Tenne 's e, when the Nationals will be 
held. UC D will be the number one seeded team at the 
tournament , and are the odds on favorit e 10 come away with the 
NCAA National Championship.

The ridge on the northeast 
corner of the reserve extension 
is not a formally designated 
part of the wildlife reserve. 
But in a formal letter to the 
California Coastal Commis-
s ion, Adrian Marine, Chair-
man of the Planning Group, 
stated that "it (the northeast 
corner of the extension) is 
obviously an inherent part of 
the Re erve and as the Park 
Rangers have controlled the 
area for several years, it has 
come as a profound shock to 

,ma ny citizens that the state 
has not yet acquired the land 
(as a reserve). "

member, will hear ca e that

One ground for automatic 
di mi al from clas i~ by 
being caught looking at 
another . tudent' , paper 
during ate, t. 

One student related an 
unfortunate experience in 
which he \'"a,' caught ch attng 
by a proctor during a math 
final. "I was dr..,parate to get a 
clue how to ~oh e one problem 
whIch \\a .... caustng me "orne 
trouhle . I had to retake Ihe 

cia ........ after the prole~. or failed 
me," h said, 

In som programming 
courses, professors stress that 

tudents must work inelc--
pendently in so lving th 
programming assignments . 
However. one student who 
take a computer programm-
ing course for a minor 
requirement say ' that he 
collaborates in writing the 
program with hi s friend 
de 'pite th profe sor' expliCIt 
in'truction. 

incl' the univer ity lack 
adequate computer faciliti s. 
it i. difficult for students to 
work independ ntly on 
programming assignments. 

The student di 'agrees that 
such an act falls under the 
category of cheating, but 
merely refer to it as a "t ime 
con ervation teChnique." 

"We do it as a result of a 
condition which my lab 
partner and I call time factor 
zero." he say . 

According the EEC 
Profe, sor Walter Burkhard, 
there are two stag in olving 
programming a signments. 
Fir t, the student mu t 
understand how to implement 
the design to the olution. 
'econdly, he creates a olution 

which mu t be accomplished 
by the student him elf. 

"5001 time. tudents 
continu collaboration even if 
they have di cussed the 
de 'ign." added Burkhard . 
• In a, elf-pac d programming 
c1a:s such as EECS Gl. the 
cour e material do not 
completely \'ary from quart('r 
to quarter. Professors who 

ha'l' taught I he ria .... " art' 
aware t hat ~()me :-.tudenh 
bornm ot her,, ' homework and 
t r~ to pass the chapt er wit hout 
I horough knowledge of t h 
material covered. 

" It is difficult to change the 
materials ev ry quarter. 
because the s tudents who 
have previously taken th 
course will be unable to help 
students curr ntly learning 
PASCAL," said EEC 
Professor Kennet h Bowie '. 

On multiple choice type 
tests, where the student are 
also allowed to use ca1cu lators 
to arrive at a final an , wer, one 
:tudent say.' that he and 
several others share calcu la-
tors to get the final an 'wer 
ba sed from t he number 
punched in . 

One junior complained that 
the set-up of the quiz sess ions 
in hi . foreIgn languag class 
encourage, cheating. He was 
involved with veral ot her in 
passing quizzes among each 
other and filling in an. wers 
left blank bytheoth rstudent. 

"The profe. sor·s back is 
usually turned behind us, and 
we take the ri 'k of pas:ing the 
quizzes around to get a good 
grade. The only way to get an 
A in the course is based on the 
highe t accumulation of 
points." he say' . 

He blames the profe sor for 
being lax in organizing the 
das: during quiz sess ions. 
because the professor neIther 
pay, attention to the students. 
nor does anylxxiv el 'e monitor 
the das~.

plagiarized material. 

The emergence of resear h 
rentals has threatened th 
acad mic environment. 

"Research I' ntals are an 
abomination . They are an 
att ack of t he v ry root of the 
educational pro 'es ' ." says 
History Professor tan ley 
Chodorow. 

"Ther is often a tremen-
dou: disparity bel we n a 
rented paper and the stud nt " 
own work," adds ChodorO\v. 

In some ca:es, th 
profe:sor's :uspi 'ion al ises 
when he notices that the 

.... tudent seems to beunfaml1iar 
\\'11 h t he examInation matenal 
but submits an unusually 
\\ell -written paper. Thus. the 

inc()nsi~tency of the student's 
writing style is unveiled . 

Professors have developed 
efficient methods to make 
cheating incidents le ss 
tempting for, tudents. 

This is achieved by giving 
s tudent s differ nt tests, by 
assigning alternate seats, and 
by proper monitoring of the 
lecture hall. 

Why do student ' cheat? 
" heat ing reflects on the 

atl i tucie of most students that 
they will do anything to 
s ucceed even if it is not 
morally acceptable," say,;
