~Elroy Advises $360 Annual Reg 
Fee for UCSD Next Year 

by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

Chancellor McElroy has 
reconunended to UC President 
Saxon that UCSD students pay a 
$360 annual Registration Fee in 
1977-78.' 

In a letter to Saxon, McElroy 
noted that in recommending the 
$360 level, he is accepting the 
advice of the Advisory Committee 
on Student Fee Programs, which 
suggested that reg fee figure for 
next year (Triton Times, Nov. 8). 

" to pennit more time for con-
sultation," according to Chuck 
Courey , Director of the UC 
Operating Budget. 

While the letter notifying UC 
campuses of the deadline extension 
was dated Nov. 5, UCSD did not 
receive official notification until 
Monday afternoon. 

Del Mar QxJncil Supports DNA Discl()SUre 
If McElroy's recommendation is 

accepted it will mean UCSD 
students who are California 
residents will pay $232 in fees next 
quarter, with $120 of that going for 
reg fee payments. Non-residents, 
with the special non-resident 
payment, will pay $867-per 
quarter. 

Four UC schools are taking 
advantage of the dealiline ex-
tension . The Berkeley, Los 
Angeles, Riverside and Santa Cruz 
campuses, when contacted by the 
Triton Times Monday, all reported 
that they have not yet made an 
official recommendation to Saxon.

Members of the newly fonned 
Citizens for Safe Research (CSR), 
a group of co~rned citizens in the 
community, solicited the support 
of the Del Mar City Council 
Monday night, and asked for 
greater corrununity participation 
in the evaluation of the potentials 
of recombinant DNA research. 

CSR member Kathy Frick said 
the citizens' group is made up of 
individuals who share a common 
interest in present and future 
recombinant research being 
conducted at UCSD. She noted that 
UCSD has applied for funding from 
the National Institutes of Health 
and the National Science Foun-
dation in support of the expansion 

of genetics engineering ex-
periments. . . 

Frick, in requesting support for 
CSR, asserted that a large per-
centage of people who live in Del 
Mar work at the University, and if 
there were a biological accident, 
"Del Mar would be the first 
community affected by it." 

In a prepared resolution later 
approved by the city council, CSR 
asked that the council request 
"UCSD to publicly disclose all 
information pertaining to grant 
proposals and on-going research on 
recombinant DNA," and further, 
"establish a mechanism that will 
insure substantial conununity 
participation in the review of sucb 
research proPosals and the im-

Controversial Town Center 
, . 

Construction U'nder Way' 
by Vera M.L Todorov 

Community Editor 
The University Town Center 

(UTC), a l05-acre shopping and 
residential complex which was the 
subject of much controversy at 
UCSD between 1973 and 1975, is 
now under construction southeast 
of the intersection of La Jolla 
Village Dr. and Genessee Ave. 

Th~ San Diego City Council 
approved a plan for the develo~ 
ment in May 1975, which stipulated 
that all design plans and con-
struction fol' the center would be 

Construction i getting under way 
for Ihe lOS·acre Uniuersity Town 
Cenler, [IT photo ; Bill Brooks) 

under Planning Commission' 
review. 

City Planner Ken Kline noted 
that the approved plan is 
aproximately one-third the size of 
the original three million square 
foot development proposed by 
developer ' Ernest Hahn in 1973. 
UTe; will be about the same size as 
Fashion Valley, which was allo 
designed by Ham. 

UTe will include three major 
departmert itores-Roblnson's, 
Sears .. d Broadway, 80 small 
shops, and 300,000 1qU81'e feet of 
housing. The houaq will consiat of 
35% lpartmeaa renUnc for fl.,.. 

$285 per month, 25% single.family 
units in the $5OJIOO to $70,000 range, 
with the remainder being multiple 
unit housing costing from $25,000 to 
$45,000. 

Kline said the project is different 
from the original which included 
650,000 square feet of shopping 
facilities, due to the elimination of 
high rise structures, an increase in 
residential units and a reduction of 
commercial space. Recently, the 
plans have been changetl to include 
a 125,000 square foot Robinson's 
department store which, along 
with the reduction of the total 
shopping area by approximately 
50,000 square feet, has increased 
the commercial space by 70,000 
square feet. 

The certer is ostensibly being 
buUt to serve the interests of the 
U~D conununity, however the 
Environmental Impact Report 
compiled by the city in 1975 defines 
the center as a regional, not local, 
soopping center. 

Effects on Campus Environment • 
The controverSf surrounding the 

center waS about the air pollution, 
congestion and traffic UTC might 
bring that would hamper the 
campus environment. 

Opponents cited the fact that the 
center is in the direct flight path of 
Miramar Naval Air Station, and 
would be subject to noise and a 
high crash probability. Kline 
stated, "noise studies indicated no 
problem ... the development is just 
OQ the other side of a line where it 
would be a problem." 

Kline also said there is no 
problem with the overcrowding of 
IChools becauae of this develo~ 
ment. "Scoool contracts are going. 

eo.bUN _ Pap' 

tions." 
DNA Researcb Being Investigated 

Frick also cited current in-
ve3tigations of the City of San 
Diego, which have included the 
formation of the DNA Study 

Commit~ out of the Quality of 
Life Board. She stated that the 
DNA Study Committee has heard 
from qualified opponents of 
recombinant DNA research and 
plans to meet with proponents of 
the research in their next meeting 
on Nov. 23. This public meeting is 
scheduled to be held at 4tOO pm in 
the 5th floor conference room of the 
City Administration Bldg. 

John H. Weare, Del Mar city 
councilman and UCSD Chemistry 
professor concurred with CSR's 
contention that recombinant 
~earch is being -done at UCSD 
aod state4 ION& j'.eAi8C(h is 
planned for the future . 

Weare . suggested the 
proliferation of recombinant DNA 
technology could be like atomic 
energy work : it can by 
'''progressive as well as 
dangerous." 

"There are many dangers we 
can't perceive," Weare said. For 
example, if an investigator cloned 
a can<;er-producing gene into 
bacteria and it was subsequently 
released, it could present a danger 
to the public. Therefore, "careful 
surveillance is a reasonable 
request to ask. " Weare concluded. 

Frick added that many of the 
questions, involved in the research 
are "ethical" and not necessarily 
biological or adentific. "The public 
has to decide whether they want to 
do this type of ~arch," Frick 
said.

Reg fees for UC students were 
originally raised this summer by 
the UC Board of Regents, which set 
an annual base fee of $348. The 
regents also offered a differential 
fee plan for the individual UC 
campuses, which could amount to 
an extra $45 in annual reg fee costs 
over the next three years. 

The regents dictated that 
maximum of $24 of the differential 
reg fee hike could be instituted in 
1977-78. 

Deadline Extended 
The original deadline for the 

chancellors' recorrunendations to 
be forwarded to Saxon was Mon-
day. However, UC Academic Vice-
president Chester McCorkle ex-
tended the deadline until Nov. 30 

Spokespersons for the latter two 
schools did indicate 1hey expect to 
recommend the $348 level to Saxon. 

Three schools, Davis, Santa 
Barbara and Irvine, told the Triton 
Times they have reconunended the 
$348 reg fee to Saxon. 

UC Expects State Support 
Several spokespersons said their 

schools recommended the $348 
level because they have been told 
by the UC Administration to 
assume the State Legislature will 
fund UC's $10 million budget 
transfer request. 

" For planning purposes in 
evaluating your (reg fee ) level," 
each .campus was told by

Looking Back at UCSD Government 
by tile RefeftDIIwD (AmmMtee .. 

tlleSCU 

With all the talk'in the air about a 
referendum on the Student 
Cooperative Union, the members 
of tbe Union'. Refer~DdDm 
Committee decided that It was 
importaJt to describe brieRy the 
history of student government at 
UCSD, tIua putting the Student 
Cooperative Union In an biatorical 
perspective. That Is the goal of tbls 
article. 

Student government at UCSD 
began with the Aaaocl.ated Studenta 
of UCSD (or ASUCSD, or the AS, 
for sbort). The AS was modeled 
after the governments on the other 
UC campuses, consisting of an 
executive and a legislative body. 
All officers were elected by the 
stud£!nt body;' the executive was 
elected campus-wide, and the 
legislators came from each coUege 
(there were three colleges in those 
days ). 

In 1972, the AS -was voted out of 
existence. in a very strange 
manner. During the academic year 
1971-72, the AS was constantly 
under fire for· charges of graft and 
corruption amonst the officerS. Its 
legitimacy declined fantastically, 
until finally, in the Winter of 1m, a 
right-wing group called the 

"Studen~ tor a Voluntary AS" 
began circulating a petition. What 
this petition asked was not bow the 
students felt about their govel'& 
ment or its officers, but focused 
instead on the mandatory nature of 
the AS Membership Fee. Tbis fee, 
six dollars per quarter per student, 
funded all activities of the AS, as 
well as all student organizations 
and other student services, such as 
the Coast Cniiser. The petition 
called for a referendwn on the 
mandatory nature of this fee. 

The results of the Winter 

triton times 
DaVid Elsen - executive editor 

referendum were overwhelDiing. 
With over '42 percem 01_ the ' 
population voting, some 72 percent 
voted to .end compuiaory mem-
berablp in the AS. T1Ius without a 
legitimate fuIIding bile, the AS 
WII destroyed. 

It is important to IDle at tIU 
point eudl1 .... t functions til! AS 
,perfenned. BaIlcaUy ,It performed 
three flIncUOIII; it allocated the AS 
Membership Fee upon request to 
student organization. and 
managed' Ita expenditure, it a~ 
pointed .udenbs to .positions on 
campus committees, and It 
represented U(S) at the Student 
Body Presidents ColUlcil and other 
statewide bocHes. 

As we have said, without a 
legitimate ftinding · base, the AS 
withered away . and disappeared 
At this point, however, the ad-
ministration, especiaUy VI~ 
chancellor George Murphy, was In 
a bind. The students voted out the 
AS, but in doing so they voted out a 
good many other programs, ser-
vices, and activities fWided by the 
AS Membership Fee. These el-
peOOitures, Murphy knew, would 
either have to disappear or be 
funded through another source. 
. That other source was the 

Registration Fee, .a source that has 
always been . overburdened, 
sometimes running large deficita. 
It simply could not handle some 
$100,000 of additional elpellSe. 

So Geol1e Murphy sent out a 
"survey fJf ~dent opinion" during 

the summer of ' 1972. In it, he 
outlined aU the uses of the AS 
Membershlp Fee, and uked the 
atudeuta whether they wan~ an 
increase, maintenance, decreue, 
or elimination of support for these 
pngams. Student reapo!lle 1& 
dlcated that aD tbettudenta wanted 
to dIIcominue funcllDg ~ wa the 
AS. All other eqendlturea were 
considered worthwhile to the 
«udenta. 

So . Murphy persuaded the 
Regents to change the .. me of the 
AS Membership Fee to the campus 
Activity Fee, the name that 
remains today. Simultaneously, 
Murphy reaUzed that some body ~ 
studera . would be needed to 
alloCate this fee, and so he per-
suaded ChanceUor McElroy to 
create a new governing body, 
called the Chancellor's Advisory 
Committee on Student Life and 
Interest (SLIC). 

SLlC, and its child TUSC (The 
Undergraduate Student ColUlcil) , 
took over the three functions of the 
AS. It was a corrunlttee composed 
of college and campus represen-
tatives. These groups carried on . 
the three functions of government 
for two years. In the Spring of 19'14, 

. rosc appointed a Model Building 
Committee to investigate new 
fonns of government for the 
students ~ Uo)D. It was this 
conunittee that came up with the 
plan for the UCSD Student 
Cooperative. .

Post Season Rewards 
For three UCSD teams, the 

. rewards are here. 
. Post-season play-offs ~nd 

tournaments are things that most 
teams shoot for, and for UCSD's

highly competitive crew team 
year. Many gold medals were 

"We feel that if all our players play to their capacity, we'll win it all," 
Millenbah says. " Our only loss was to USD, but it was the league opener 
and it was the worst game we've played in six years. If we keep our 
serves in and play good defense, I think we'll win." 

Millenbah says that his current team is the best, total talent-wise, that 
he has ever had, and that setters Holly Stewart and Aileen Horimoto are 
the league's best setters. 

Horimoto and Andrea Beylen are currently among those considered for 
UCSD's female Athletes of the Month for October and November. 

Gary Becker's waterpoloists are in a pair of season-ending tourneys 
this weekend. Friday and Saturday will be the Riverside Invitational, 
with opponents including the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the 
University of Redlands. Mter two games Saturday, the Tritons are 
scheduled to travel to Claremont College forlhe tougher NAIA Division 2 
and 3 Invitational. 

The Tritons go into the post-season after its most difficult regular 
season in history. Among the opponents were UCLA and the University of 
Arizona, to be seeded first and sevenU1 in the upcoming NCAA Nationals, 
yet UCSD finished with the top Southern California record among small 
college independents.

The unit of 35 football referees for intramural's winter quarter deserve 

some kind of commendation. ' 
Trained by Rick Crawford, Scot Harkness and Mike HipP1 the group 

was " The best we've ever had," according to assistant mtramural 
director Hipp. "Much of the success of the program depends on them, and 
they did a fine job." '-

What amazed me was not tremendous penalty-calling-no referees will 
ever get complimented for that. It was the control of the games that they

The Surfing club is holding its first annua I Amateur Sltateboard Contest 
Saturday from lOam to 3pm on Myers Dr., north of Central Library.

Playoff time. The days at the end of the quarter when the intramural 
athletes that we all know and love change their fDlIIlks and come out to 
win at all costs. No more Mister Nice Guy. If you lose there are no more 
games to play. "c" League playoff games resemble "A" league games in 
their intensity. Every team wants to win that coveted championship that 
only one team can win. 

W"ater Polo 
As in football, Coed Innertube Watel: Polo will have separate playoffs 

for the "A," " B" and "c" Leagues. Playoffs will begin the week after 
Thanksgiving and continue until there are three champions, instead of 
the one of past years. 

Most of the playoff pairings have been set as of this time, but could 
change as the result of th~ nasty eligibility checks. (Remember only 
students, faculty/staff with a Rec Card and Alumni and Friends with a 
Rec Card are eligible to compete.) 

Headed for the "A" League double elimination tournament are the 
peremlaldefending champions, the UNDERWATER CHEAPSHOTS. 
SUPPERY WHEN WET and TIlE UP AND COMINGS are expected to 
make things tougher for the CHEAPIiIfOTS this time around. 

CHUCKlE'S DUCKIES and HELL-IF-I-KNOWS appear to be the 
favorites in the "B" League playoffs with the GOLDEN SHOWERS and 
the HARPOONS being given an outside shot at winning it all. 

In the "C" League one of the favorite teams DOWN TIlE TUBES, has 
already been eliminated from playoff action because of an ineligible 
player. With DOWN THE TUBES down the tubes it leaves the 
FORKERS, STERN TUBES and GROOVE TUBERS in the role of 
favorites. 

Football 
Most of the first round action in all levels of the football playoffs have 

been completed. Most games went according to fonn with the exception 
of one major upset and a couple of close calls. 

In coed action, top rated FROTTAGE was upset by LAGNAF, 9~ in 
overtime. LAGNAF stopped FROTIAGE's Connie Parker on the last 
play of the game to win by a yard. 

In a close " A" League game SCRIPPS was saved by the dark and held 
on to register a 20-18 win over SHABBY-VEES. 

In "c" league play the top rated and unscored upon DEREUcrS 
survived a second half rally by 4th AND 40, and escaped with a 14-13 
overtime win. 

Floor Hockey 
The First Annual Kirsner Kup Men's Floor Hockey Tournament ended 

in a tie : In what proved to be the deCiding game (or non-deciding game), 
if you wish) of the round robin tourney , SAURIAN CRUNCH and LITTLE 
GREEN BAGS played to a 1-1 draw. The Heroism Award for the tourney 

-goes to the RAU DAUERS, an inexperienced, but enthusiastic team. They 
were outseored 40-1 through the course of the tournament, but provided 
the most emotional moment of the day when Don MacRae scored in their 
5-1 loss to MEN FROM MORDER.

(;ounty Transit will extend its coast nm south to l:;th 
St. 

The coast cruiser, which has ferried UCSD 
students from the campus to their homes in the 
north COlUlty for the past several years, will be 
phased out beginning Feb. 7. 

Nick Aguilar, directqr of Of(-(:ampus Housing, 
said in a recent interview that the cruiser is \H:ing 
phased out in favor of a combined San Transit

between the Central library and North Coumy at a

Initiany, the~ will als9 be an express ~ 
operated by the University to North County. It Will 
run twice in both the morning and the afternoon, 
due to the forty to fifty minutes the 41 takes to go 
from campus to 15th St. The express will take about 
20 minutes. Corp.-North County Transit run. • 

The new arrangement "would provide . better 
overall transportation for the UCSD community," 
Aguilar said. 

Eventually, San Diego Transit plans t9l'W) the 41 
line along the Coast H wy. 

All times are tentative for now, but finalized 
schedules should be available in two to four weeks. 
San Diego Transit plans to charge 35c, including a 

r~ee transfer, and Nortll County Transit plans a 2Sc 
fare and a 10e transfer. 

He added that, in spite of the linkup, UCSD will 
continue to act as an advocate for the university 
community in transit affairs. Aguilar said he hopes 
to keep the transit companies ~esponsive to the 
needs of UCSD. 

San DIego Transit plans to extend its 41 line from 
its current stopping point at Del ~ar Heights Rd. 
and Highway 5 to 15th St. in Del Mar a.nd the Coast 

Highwa~, via 4th St. and Coast Highway. No~ 

The Coast Cruiser has currently added an ex-
perimental 8 pm run, and its success will be 
dependent upon the number of passengers. 

Current Coast Cruiser schedules are available in 
the Student Center. 

Reg fees... 
McCorkle, "you shoul~ assume the 
current RegiStration Fee and 
Education Fee expenditures on 
your campus for Instruction and 
Research laboratory costs, health 
sciences tuition offset, financial 
aid administration and the im· 
mediate office of the Vice· 
chancellor of Student Affairs win 
be replaced with state or Regents' 
funds beginning in 1977-78." 

In its budget request for the next 
school year, the UC Administration 
is asking the state to assume ex· 
penses in a three·part, phase-in 
program, beginning with un-
dergraduate laboratory costs, and 
then proceeding to financial aids 
and student affairs expenses. 

Contacted Monday, Oscar 
Moreno, student co-chairman of 
UCSD's Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs, said the 
committee arrived at its recom-

mendation by working under the 
assumptions in McCorkle's lett·er. 

If the Legislature and Governor 
do not approve the fund' shift, 
Moreno said, " We'Uhave a $450r(!g 
fee next year. " 

Advisory committee student 
member Ann Carberry, also 
contacted Monday, said there is a 
good chance the phase-in plan will 
be accepted by the Legislature 
because it is more susceptible to 
pressure than Gov. Brown, who 
has indicated unwillingness in the 
past to increase UC funding. 

In his letter to Saxon, McElroy 
said the advisory committee " has 
concluded that a lee of $348 would 
lead to a severe curtailment of 
student affairs programs and 
services." 

Moreno disagreed with McElroy, 
saying the committee was 

"misquoted.'~ Drawing a distinc-

By the time UTe opens, the schools

The opponents of the center just 
see it as the first move to develop 
another 600 acres of land 
surrounding the center. The land is 
owned by Penasqui~, Inc., of 

tion betwe~n " severe cur· 
tailment" and restructuring, 
Moreno said a $348 reg fee would 
mean a restructuring of programs 
funded by reg fee monies. 

CarberrY said the adoption of a 
$360 reg fee will allow the advisory 
committee flexibility in attempting 
to preserve the current level of 
student services. 

" The $348 figure would be un-
workable unless the ad-
ministration is willing to commit 
itself to cutting out the fat, .. 
Carberry stated. A $348 reg fee 
would require "sound managerial 
practices," not wholesale budget 
cuts, she explained.' 

A $348 reg fee, Moreno said, 
would inevitably mean a $372 reg 
fee in 1978-79 and a $393 reg fee the 
following year. A $360 fee, on the -
other hand, means the fee may not 
rise to the maximum $393, he 
added.

American Jazz, as exhibited by the Gus Giordano dance company, 
borrows freely from ballet, modern dance, popular dances and the 

. Broadway stage. This fusion of qance forms proveq effective throughout 
most of their concert last Friday night in the Mandeville center 
auditorium. 

The most successful blend of these dance styles was exhibited in 'New 
York Export,' a series offour dances a bout the moods of New York Street 
Kids of the 195Os. Set to a jazz score by Robert Prince, the dance in-
corporated Broadway chorus line, the popular dances of the 50s, even the 
distinctive saunter of street toughs to' convey their clJulness, arrogance 
and frustration. 

In 'Entrances,' the first of the four passages, the dancers convincingly 
portrayed the tension that underlies the studied nonchalance of gang 
members. 'Statics' emphasized the bravura of gang rrl.;mbers with the 
dancers trying to outdo each other with difficult leaps and turns. 
'Passage for Two' was a duet about two teenagers in love, danced by 
Jeffrey Mildenstein and Meribeth Kisner. Their movement expressed the 
tenderness and violence of the affair. Mildenstein captured the 
frustration and anger of the youth with his powerful style. The finale was 
an exploration of movement to jazz music. The wrist and arm isolations 
of the dancers underscored the insistent beat of the music. 

The most exciting number on the show was 'Solar Wind,' a study of 
energy, controlled in sinuous hip and torso movement and released in 
percussive bursts. The dance included dazzling combinations of leaps and 
turns that showed the technical bdlliance of the dancers. Clarence 
Teeters demonstrated his exceptional style, moving with a rippling 
fluidity; you could see the energy flow from his arms and legs. 

The peak that the dancers hit with 'Solar Wind' and 'New York Export' 
unfortunately was not equalled with the closing dance, a tribute to Judy 
Garland. The main problem with 'Judy' was that the dancers imitated the 
cabaret steps and chorus line kicks of Garland's nightclub routine instead 
of using these movements in jazz dance. Though the troupe danced 
engagingly and energetically, it seemed as if they were squandering their 
talents on Carol Burnett show style dancing. 

Throughout the show the dancers: Walders, Teeters, Mildenstein, 
Kisner and Kim Kolb, performed ,at a consistently high leveL Walders 
and Teeters are the standouts, the former in terms of s~yle, the latter in 
technique. 

Giordano's brand of jazz is always exciting. At its best, it is also 
uniquely reflective of American culture because it borrows from popular 
dance forms as well as classical ones. 

long pauses between numbers, she 
recited her poetry. Her verse, 
sadly, is a .word salad of mangled 
reference points in which the 
spirits of ' Rimbaud, Kerouac, 
Hurroughs, and various EJlst 
Village beatnikisms are tom apart 
in her search for the perfect 
revelatory image. Bathed·in.a soft 
blue spot light, head lifted, eyes 
closed, and fists striking her chest 
in sequence to key phrases, she 
achieved a veneer of tran-
scendence, seeming like a tough 
angel so raptured by her good 
feelings that she's reduced to 
enthWied incoherency. 

The only original facet of Smith's 
act is Smith herself. Her idealism 
is admirable, but her reductionism 
is so fervid that it's-hard to believe 
that she actually means it. Her 
tough guy stance is as 'much pose 
as Bowie's synthetic electicism, a 
post that operates as an attention 
getting device. But Smith deserves 
attention, if only to see an 
anachronism in action. Where 
she'll go from there is anyone's 
guess. One is hard pressed to say 
that her loss will be felt.
