Ramirez, Robison In Runoff 
Election for A.S. Presidency 

By REBEKAH YOUNG 
Staff Writer 

A runoff election will be held 
this Wednesday to fill several key 
A.S. offices, including president. 
Candidates for those offices failed 
to receive a majority of votes in 
last week's election. 

The results of that election were 
announced on Thursday night at 
the Triton Pub, before a cheering 
crowd of students and candidates. 

A candidate must receive 50 
percent of the vote plus one to be 
elected. John Ramirez and John 
Robison, the two presidential 
candidates who received the larg-
est numbers of votes, will partici-
pate in a run-off election. 

Robison received 935 votes or 
37.2 percent of all votes cast for 
the position. Ramirez earned 825 
votes or 32.8 percent of all votes 
cast for the position. 

Roy "Turtle" Hobbs received 
324 votes or 12.8 percent of the 
votes. J. Anthony Waldichuk 
received 264 votes or 10.5 percent 
of the vote while Paul Zimmer 
and Ory Sandel pulled in 94 and 
75 votes or 3.7 and 3 percent of all 
votes, respectively. 

"I wasn't really looking at the 
outcome of the race," Ramirez 
said after the result announce-
ments. "I just wanted to make 
sure the issues I addressed were 
heard: that there is a need for a 

stronger student voice and that 
the A.S . council must work with 
the student body to accomplish 
this," he added. 

Robison said the results held 
"no surpri es" for him. 

"I expected a run-off with six 
candidates and I expected John 
Ramirez would be the one in the 
run-off with me," he said. " I just

RESULTS, page 3 

hope those people who supported 
me the first time, support me a 
second time, though there is usu-
ally a lower voter turnout in a 
run-off election," Robison said. 

Alex Wong won the Vice Pres-
ident Administrative seat with 59 
percent of the vote. 

Other offices to appear on 
Wednesday ' run-off ballot will 
include Vice President-External, 
Vice President-Financial, Com-
missioner of Academic Affairs , 
and Commissioner of Public 
Relation . 

Mishka Migacz and Craig 
Peters are in a run-off for the Vice 
Presidential-External seat. Migacz 
was not surprised by the outcome. 

"I was told by a variety of peo-
ple there might be a run-off," 
Migaczsaid . "I knew Craig Peters, 
a Sigma Nu member, would get 
the Greek vote because in the first 
election, the Greeks got points for 
voting. Whichever fraternity or 
sorority got the mo t voting stubs 
would get a reward," she added. 

"I knew I'd get the people's vote

an event attended by an estimated 
200 spectator . 

The recently circulated flyers 
described the event, and claimed 
that Robison "as a former Vice 
President of the fraternity . .. con-
doned the actions of his fellow 
members," and went on to ask, 
"What will he do as A.S. Presi-

County Supervisors Pass Ordinance 

Flyers have appeared on 
campus accusing A.S. presidential 
run-off candidate and Sigma 
Alpha Mu member John Robison 
of condoning a recent controver-
sial rush week event sponsored by 
his fraternity. 

In an interview with the 
Guardian, Robison denied respon-
sibility for the event, agreed with 
charges that the event was sexist, 
and expressed regret that the event 
was held on campus. 

Robison said that the flyers are 
"just bad news, that's all," and 
feels that they mar an otherwise 
"clean" campaign. Robison, cur-
rently A.S. vice president of 
administration, faces a run-off 
election for A.S. president Wed-
nesday against Muir Junior Sena-
tor John Ramirez. 

By MARY BETTY HEARD 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to prevent the rec-
urrence oflast November's medi-
cal waste Wash-ups, the San Diego 
County Board of Supervisors last 
month passed an ordinance regu-
lating storage and disposal of 
medical waste. 

The new ordinance which will 
take effect July 21 replaces the 
emergency ordinance on hazard-
ous waste drafted in November 
and will increase restrictions on 
producers for the disposal of medi-
cal waste in the county. 

According to County Supervi-
sor Susan Golding, the previous 
laws did not regulate facilities 
that produced less than 220 
pounds of medical waste. 

The new ordinance, Golding 
said, removes the 220 pound mar-
gin and stipulates that "each insti-
tution that does produce medical 
waste is required by the ordinance 
to [draft] their own [ management] 
plan, which is reviewed and ap-
proved by the County Depart-

ment of Environmental Health." 
Such a management plan would 

include listings of the types of 
waste produced and methods of 
disposal, and is to be submitted 
on a yearly basis, said a source in 
Golding's office. 

The ordinance also defines 
hazardous waste as belonging to 
one of three categories: infectious 
waste (capable of transmitting 
diseases), hazardous waste (includ-
ing "sharps" that could puncture 
skin), and aesthetically displeas-
ing waste (piles of gloves and 
bandages). 

Violators of the ordinance can 
be prosecuted in either criminal 
or civil proceedings, depending 
upon the circumstances of the 
violation, Golding said. 

According to a source in Gold-
ing's office, civil prosecutions can 
involve up to SIO,OOO in fines and 
criminal prosecutions can involve 
both fines and jail time. 

Facilities that produce medical 
waste will also be required to dis-
pose of waste in special red bags 
marked with the companies' 
names and addresses. 

The ordinance will take effect 
in July because "we wanted to 
leave enough time for producers 
of [medical waste disposal] bags 
to come up with a method of 
labeling," Golding explained.

UCLA Health Officials Act 
to A void Measles Outbreak 
By MICHAEL ASHCRAFT 
Science Writer. Daily Bruin 

LOS ANGELES - Moving swiftly to head off an outbreak of 
measles on the UCLA campus, health officials there launched an 
immunization program last Monday to give free vaccinations to 
students. 

After two recent cases of UCLA students with measles, cam-
pus health officials feared the viruli might spread rapidly as did 
the USC outbreak last fall. 

The disease afflicted Trojan quarterback Rodney Peete and 
almost kept him from playing against the Bruins. 

"Measles is not the disease to take lightly," said Dr. Deborah 
Shlian, who started the UCLA measles clinic. "You don't want to 
wait until you've been exposed to get the vaccine." 

See MEASLES, paCt 7 

Ramirez said that he had seen 
the flyers, but had no idea who 
was responsible for them. 

"I've been telling my friends to 
throw [the flyers] away," Ramirez 
said. 

Robison acknowledged that he 
attended the event, but added 
that Sigma Alpha Mu members 
were required to attend rush week 
events. He denied knowing of the 
evening's program beforehand. 

"Most of the fraternity was 
under the impression that it was 
going to be an oil wrestling event, 
which is an event we've had in the 
past, with bikini tops and bot-
toms, not nudity. I think the 
stripper was a urprise to just 
about everyone," including him-
self, Robison said. 

The show was not a fraternity-
only event and, Robison claimed, 
Sigma Alpha Mu members were 
on hand mainly for security

UC Santa Barbara Patrols Rugby 
Tournament on Police Mounts 
SA T A BARBARA - Last weekend UCS B held its 
annual international rugby tournament. Hundreds of 
athlete attended the event, which is u ually known as 
a weekend party. Last year during the rugby tourna-
ment police issued 154 alcohol-related citations and 
145 other for mi cellaneous offenses. 

This year however, police deployed law enforce-
ment officials on hor eback for the fi rst time. The 
mounted police force was called ucces ful as local 
police encountered a relatively "slow" weekend , des-
pite the hundreds of athletes attending the tournament. 

Friday and Saturday police patrolling Isla Vi ta 
arrested 31 persons for alcohol-related offense and 
issued 99 citations. ' 0 charges were filed against the 
majority of those arrested , most of whom were 
relea ed after sobering up, according to Santa Barbara

"Gods Must Be Crazy" Film Initiates 
Protests at U CSB 

ANTA BARBARA At UC B a group from 
the campus radio station unwittingly found itself in 
the spotlight of contrO\ersy as a result of its decision 
to sponsor showings of the film "The Gods Must Be 
Cra7Y" a a fundraiser. 

"Gods" is about a South African tnbemember who 
goes on a quest to rid hi tribe of a cola bottle which 
falls from an airplane and becomes an object of wor-
ship by the tribe. 

Member of KCSB did not find out until last week 
that the film has a controver ial hi tory, including 
charges that it portrays blacks in a negative light. 
After objections to its presentation were raised. organ-
izers arranged for discussions following each howing 
on apartheid and the repression of blacks. 

"When 1 heard the film would be shown as a KCSB 
fundraiser, I was very disturbed,~ said black studies 
librarian Sylvia Curtis, a KCSB disc jockey and one 
of the intiators of the prot est." ure, the lead charac-
ter is a charming man, but he is simple and childlike. 
The film is totally raci t in that the African people a~ 
a whole are portrayed as children who are unable to 
organize and care for themselves," she said.

that he and coordinator John Wasserbauer, the

event's organizers, simply were not aware of the film's 
content when they booked it.

UC Davis Student Appeals 
Disqualification in ASUCD Election 

DA VIS - ASUCD's Student Appeals Board 
(SAB) ruled April 5 that the ASUCD Student Judi-
cial Board (SJ B) erred in its recent decision to dis-
qualify Binnie Singh, an A UCD executive 
councilmember-elecl, for overexpenditure and failure 
to report a ca mpaign expense. The SAB also found a 
number of procedural error throughout the SJB's deal-
ings with the Singh case. 

Singh's troubles began in late February after the 
Election Co mmittee discovered an error in one of her 
two campaign expenditure form . Singh was initially 
penalized for failing to report a $6 expenditure for 
campaign pictures she had half-toned at The Califor-
nia Aggie. Since the half-toning receipt was disl;o-
vered after Singh had surpassed the $100 spending 
limit by 75 cents, SJ B as e sed her seven violation 
points, one point for every dollar she exceeded the 
limit. She was also penalized an additional three 
points for faili ng to report the expenditure. Having a 
total of 10 violation points agai nst her, Singh was 
disqualified according to the ASUCD codes. 

After four hours of testimony from numerous wit-
nesses, Singh, the candidate who received the greatest 
number of votes in the election, was awarded the seat 
to which she was elected more than a month ago.

Fraternity Incident 
The image of a woman stripping before 200 Sigma Alpha Mu 

fraternity members, pledges and other spectators in Peterson 
Hall has enraged a great number of people and has, sadly, 
amu ed others. Neither of these reactions, however, are condu-
cive to a rational evaluation of this event and its potential 
consequences. 

It is disturbing that the members of the Sigma Alpha Mu 
fraternity saw nothing wrong with paying a woman to disrobe as 
a legitimate way to attract new members to their organization. It 
is also disturbing that the fraternity chose a campus lecture hall 
as an appropriate site for this particular event. The fraternity has 
apologized for the incident (see Letters at right) , but it is unclear 
whether the members are sorry they hired a woman to strip for 
them or whether they are sorry they are the subjects of unwanted 
criticism. 

The Sigma Alpha M u frate rnity is not the first fraternity to 
hire a stripper for a rush event, though they are apparently the 
only one to hire a stripper to perform on campus. The dry rush 
policy has sent fraternities looking for non-alcoholic alternatives 
to attract pledges. U nfortunately, programming sexually explicit 
functions is the alternative fraternities are frequently choosing. 

This endangers the programming freedom of all students. 
Vice Chancellor of Unde rgraduate Affairs Joe Watson has 
requested a review of the administrative procedures that govern 
programming by student organizations. This is dangerous. It 
will be extremely difficult to draft a policy that prohibits sexu-
ally explicit events but which does not give the administration 
greater power to censor student programming. 

Sigma Alpha Mu members were clearly embarrassed by the 
pu blicity t his incident received . This embarrassment may not be 
a strong enough check against this type of event occurring again, 

b~t e~panding administration control over campus program-
mIng tS too high a price to pay. Any member of the Che Cafe 
co-op can attest to the difficulty of programming under the 
watchful eye of the administration. 

All we can do is hope that student organizations will demon-
strate more responsibility in programming than Sigma Alpha 
M u did in this case. Trusting the administration to impose that 
responsibility would be foolish . 

Disturbing Election Notes 
A few observations on the elections: 

• The campaign is much too short - a little over a week. This 
forces voters to make ill-informed decisions, and many don't 
vote at all. 

• Elections should take place in the third or fourth week of the 
quarter, not the second. 

• The usual petty political games took: place this year. Don't 
be su rprised by a wave of accusations of violations after the 
run-off.

Fraternity 
Apologizes 
·Editor: 

The brothers of Sigma Alpha 
Mu would like to take this oppor-
tunity to formally apologize for 
recently sponsoring an offensive 
ru h event on campu . We exer-
cised poor judgment in our deci-
sion and assure you that this type 
of event doe not represent the 
ideas and beliefs of our brother-
hood . 

We are sorry for any negative 
feelings this event may have fos-
tered and assure you that such an 
event will not be held by Sigma 
Alpha Mu in the future. Once 
again , we regret sponsoring this 
event and apologize to anyone 
who may have taken offense to it. 

Sigma Alpha Mu 

Stripper Show 
Draws Fire 
Editor: 

There are two reasons that I am 
outraged at the Sigma Alpha Mu 
fraternity. One is that they held 
such an event (Guardian. April 
13) on campus. (If they can't have 
alcohol, they'll have sex?) The 
other is that they considered it an 
appropriate event to hold . 

The second , I feel, is more fun-
damentally important tlian the 
first. It hows an incredible 
amount of insensitivity at the 
least , and downright contempt 
for women at the most. That 
event was tantamount to the slave 
auctions held by fraternities and 
so roundly denounced on several 
campuses across the country re-
cently. In the larger sense, it con-
dones the treatment of another 
human being as an object. 

The ramifications of this kind of 
treatment of women are substa n-
tial. It is not surprising that date 
rape is a growing issue on cam-
puses now. Those men are learn-
ing to expect to be entertained by 
a woman's sexuality; to not take 
women seriously as human beings. 
How would they feel if it were 
their mother, sister, daughter, 
girlfriend mingling among 200 
men having her breast suckled by 
whomever wants to? If it wouldn't 
be OK, then it's wrong. If it would 
be OK, I say there is something 
wrong with the guy. 

ot only did she "a ppear" as 
the headline states, but she was 
actively fondled by members of

article. That kind of behavior is· 
not even allowed in tople s bars. 
What they did i the arne as hir-
ing a prostitute .• She provided 
them with sexual stimulation and 
foreplay. It is wrong for a univer-
sity campus to condone that 
behavior by allowing it in a uni-
versity facility. The fraternity 
should be disciplined . The women 
on this campu hould be out-
raged .

Withdrawal 
From Race 
Editor: 

After careful consideration I 
have decided to withdraw from 
the rare for the A.S. Council. I 
ente;ed the competition to pro-
vide honest, upright leadership, 
to fight for causes that the entire 
student body could Su pPO": fight-
ing the fee increases, the r. ight-
time parking permit, and provid-
ing community-based sources of 
scholarship and financial aid . 

However, to my dismay, the 
close race between Darin Malloy 
and myself has become a compe-
tition of dissension, insu lts, back.-
biting, and tension. 

This i:lectioit has become a 
choice between my values and a 
small political office. 

It has been excruciating for me 
to see candidates whom I have 
considered my friends torn apart 
by politics. I intend to continue in 
politics, behind-the-scenes, as I 
always have, to fight for student 
interests. 

I wish Darin Malloy, the new 
commissioner of academic affairs, 
the best of luck in the year to 
come, and I hope that any further 
elections at UCSD will proceed in 
a spirit of good will and fairness, 
even between opponents. 

Thank you, UCSD , the 
Guardian, voters, friends, and my 
excellent running-mate Joshua 
Gross, for your support and 
encouragement.

AIDS Photos 
Don't Exploit 
Editor: 

In respon e to the letter written 
by Mr. Robert Kinney concern-
ing the Grove Gallery's "Portraits 
in the Time of AIDS" show,l feel 
Mr. Kinney has missed the entire 

point of the show. Its whole pur-
pose is not to exploit, but to edu-
cate. Rosalind Solomon'S pictures 
give us a new and different oppor-
tunity to increase the awareness 
of AIDS and show the diversity 
of people affected with the dis-
ease. rather than as "monsters" as 
M r. Kinney put it. 

The show is about living with 
AIDS, not dying with it , and how 
it can affect many people's lives. It 
seems to me that Mr. Kinney 
zeroed in on a select few of the 
portraits instead of visualizing 
and taking into account all of the 
portraits as a whole. Sure, there 
are some very ill-pictured, but in 
many cases the people appear 
healthy, when in fact they are not, 
and in many cases one cannot tell 
whether those pictured are af-
fected . 

Unfortunately, many people 
choose to ignore the diversity of 
this disease into all social classes, 
races, and geographic zones, but 
fortunately there are people like 
Rosalind Solomon, the Grey Art 
Gallery in New York and the 
Grove Gallery here at UCSD that 
are willing to help educate us on 
AIDS and how it can touch 
anyone's life.

Answer Isn't 
Legal Drugs 
Editor: 

In his letter to the editor 
(Guardian. April 13), William T. 
Holmes inanely tries to pin all of 
our country's problems on the 
illegality of drugs. It is true that a 
large percentage of crimes are 
drug-related . It is true that drugs 
in our school seriously damage 
our educational system. It is true 
that gun-wielding drug lords may 
cause "good citizens"to relinquish 
their right to bear assault wea-
pons. But would legalization of 
drugs solve these problems, as 
Mr. Holmes proposes? A quick 
survey of other countries of the 
world says "no." 

The life expectancy in Sweden 
is the highest in the world. Japan 
is on the brink of being the new 
leader of the free world (not sur-

. pass!ng the U.S., but by owning 
it). The murder rate is over 100 
times higher in the U.S. than in 
England , France or West Ger-
many. Switzerland is consistently 
rated as the best country in which 
to live. Are drugs legal in any of 
these countries? No.

Iguanas, Ducks, Dogs and Other Critters 
store. His brother still does and his sister 
manages the store. So Robbie got igua-
nas for Christmas. I got a fish aquarium 
for my birthday and frogs for Valentine's 
Day - how romantic. At least he wrote 
"I Love You" on the plastic bag they were 
jumping around in. 

The frogs are named Sarah and Bill, 
the first of my friends to be getting mar-
ried, and they are the most exciting 
things in the fish tank. Sure I have the fat 
pink fish , Purple Paradise, and some 
sunset fish , but the frogs with legs twice 
as long as their bodies and big old 
webbed feet are the be t to watch. But 
they are the worst to feed because they 
have terrible eyesight. You have to feed 
them brine shrimp on chopsticks to get it 
right next to their mouths. The hrimp 
are stored in the freezer, and once my 
mom mistook the glass of frozen shrimp 
for a glass of frozen Coke. 

National Society of Black 
Engineers 

presents a lecture by 

My mom drinking brine shrimp is 
nothing compared to the duck we used to 
have who would have rotelli pasta noo-
dles each night for dinner. Muck, our 
duck, had her own kiddie wading pool on 
the patio. I guess because she wasn't get-
ting the proper duck nutrition she would 
lay eggs withOUt" the shell . Then she 
would eat them. Yuk! But my mom kept 
giving her noodles instead of normal 
duck food because Muck liked the noo-
dles so much. She went crazy; she buried 
her face into the slimy cold pasta, scat-
tered the curls all over the patio and went 
after them like slugs. 

Sometimes when 1 got home from 
school I would find Muck in my room. 
She must have snuck into the house, 
waddled into my room, and stood in 
front of my full-length mirror gazing at 
herself all day long, only to have made a 
mess on my carpet. Muck lasted a long 

time, until my sister took her to Mission 
Bay and tried to make her swim with the 
other ducks. She threw her out in the 
water at least ten times and Muck always 
swam back to us quacking real soft like 
she did when we'd rub her beak until she 
fell asleep. Finally he swam to the mid-
dle of the Bay and refused to come back.. 
We waited for hours. She just kept 
swimming further and further away. We 
still go to Mission Bay looking for her. 

Muck , even with the tragic ending, was 
a much better pet than the baby chicken 
we had who got thirsty and jumped into 
the toilet and drowned . At least it was the 
easiest to bury. 

The worst pets were the hamsters and 
rabbits . All they did was reproduce, 
scra tch or bite you, escape. and have all 
the other animals chase them. There 
might still be a family of hamsters living

Drugs 
Continued from palte 4 

Can you therefore pin our 
co untry's problems on the "eco-
nomics" of drug supply and 
demand? Also, no . If these coun-
tries can solve their problems 
without legalizing drugs , then so 
ca n we. And what about those 
countrie of the world that are 
"soft" on drugs? I the political 
strife and corru ption of South 
and Central America what we 
want for the United States of 
America? 

than on desires to buy drugs more 
cheaply. Quite obviously, the 
matter of drug legalization does 
not belong in the hands of drug 
u ers. 

is nOf due to their illegality, for 
even if they were legalized. as M r. 
Holmes proposes, I would still 
not use them. My own choice? 
Yes . Your own choice'! Not if 
you're driving on the same high-
way on which I'm driving. And 
not if you're my wife and give 
birth to a malformed baby. 

It occurs to me that Mr. 
Holmes' reasoning for wanting to 
legali7e drugs is based less on bet-
teringeducation or reducing crime 

It is a known fact that drug u e 
not only impairs brain function, 
but can permanently damage it as 
well. So is there a correlation 
between the fact that I have never 
touched pot or coke and that I am 
graduating from Revelle College 
in four years on $10,000 in 
National Merit Scholarships? I 
am not any kind of stereotypical 
"Revelle bookworm." I am in-
volved in many extracurricular 
activities and you can find me at 
any TG or in the Pub on Friday. 

The simpleminded ness of Mr. 
Holmes'''solution'' will only serve 
to make an existing problem 
worse. Market economics is not 
the solution to all of society's 
woes. Eliminating the demand for 
these dangerous and addictive 
drugs is the only solution. It's just 
plain stupid to use them, and it 
infringe on my rights when you 
do.

in the couch. 

We had a few cats, but I always felt like the cats 
thought they were better than I was. They would 
come and go a they pleased, but at least they 
decreased the out of control hamster population. 

Then there is the bird. My friend had me take 
care of it for the summer, but Homer, alias Dodo 
to my boyfriend and Tanako to my sister study-
ing Japanese history, is so happy at our house 
that he doesn't want to leave. We don't make him 
stay in his cage. When people come over they 
have to duck because of the parakeet who circles 
the living room trying to land in my mom's hang-
ing plant. He is a mutant bird : his beal. doesn't fit 
together, it it crooked on his face, and the top 
part just keeps growing because he is so stupid , he 
doe n't know how to sand it down. 

The dogs are the best pets yet, at least in terms 
of exci tement. There is the midnight hockey 
tournament when they slide their metal water 
di h across the patio. On some nights a siren can 

get them singing for hours with the canyon 
coyote . During the day the dogs plan creative 
landscaping to please my mom. They gnaw on 
the fruit tree and yank out the hibiscus bush to 
play their own game of catch. Then there are the 
times when the newest addition to the family, 
Sydney, with his puppy energy, raids the garage 
and pulls out all of the paint rollers and brushes 
and drags them across the patio in an attempt to 
repaint it. 

Sydney was a "gift" from my boyfriend. The 
strange thing is that Sydney looks and acts just 
like my boyfriend - they are both stocky and 
brown-haired. Needless to say the other dog, a 
huskie, is my favorite. I found Sashka on the 
inter ection of Balboa and Clairemont Drive. He 
was crossing the road, weaving in and out of cars, 
and happened to jump inside my car window. 
Sa hka has these beautiful blue eyes, the clearest 
blue, they are almost white. He may be pretty, but 
he· has his peculiar habits too. He likes to steal 
Sydney's dinner by carrying the dish full offood 
around the backyard in his teeth until Sydney 
cries, then he empties the bowl and buries the 
food .

MEASLES: Students Threatened 
Continued from pace I 

Noting the rapid spread of 
measles at other universities, 
health officials say college cam-
puses are particularly vulnerable 
to contagion because large num-
bers of people interact there. 

"They're saying this is a well-
educated virus," quipped Laurel 
Eu, editor for Student Health 
Services. "One year it hit Loyola 
Marymount [University]. This 
year it hit USC." 

A highly contagious disease, 
the measles is erupting all over 
Southern California . In Los 
Angeles County, eight people have 
died since January, and 480 peo-
ple have developed symptoms, 
said Paul Frederick, epidemiolo-
gist at the county's immunization 
program. 

When 40 Trojans developed 
measles in mid-November, USC 
offered free immunization and 
eventually gave the vaccine, a 
weakened strain of the virus which 
builds antibodies, to 3,800. 

Preventive measures will be 
similar at UCLA. Dosages ofthe 
Rubeola-Rubella vaccine, which 
ordinarily costs 56.55 each, were 
offered free on a voluntary basis 
from St~ent Health Services. 

UCLA is reacting to two stu-
dents who apparently contracted 
the measles independently on 
March 21. 

A medical student was hospi-
talized in UCLA's medical center, 
and an unrelated undergraduate 

was diagnosed in West Los Ange-
les's Kaiser Medical Center, 
Frederick said. 

In another case April 5, a 
patient treated in the UCLA 
emergency medical room may 
have exposed other patients and 
physicians, Frederick said. 

The common strain of measles, 
known as the IO-day measles, 
starts feeling like a cold with a 
fever, congestion, cough, overly-
sensitive eyes. It develops into an 
itchy rash before disappearing, in 
most cases, after 10 days. Com-
plications involve diarrhea, vom-
iting, and dehydration, Frederick 
said. 

Typically, the virus mUltiplies 
inside a body for 14 days before 
any symptoms appear. 

Los Angeles's measles outbreak 
first appeared in South Los 
Angeles in August 1987 and has 
slowly spread north into the San 
Fernando Valley and the City of 
Glendale, at the same time mov-
ing south into Orange, Riverside, 
San Bernadino and San Diego 
Counties, Frederick said. 

USC's rash of cases attracted 
wide attention when health ex-
perts worried the disease might 
infect more people at the popular 
rivalry football game against 
UCLA. 

When USC quarterback Peete 
caught the measles, the Trojan 
football team, as well as the Bruins 
and two subsequent rivals, were 
immunized, Frederick said. 

WASTE: Ordinance Passed 
Continued from pale 1 

She went on to say that the task 
force involved allowed a 9O-day 
lag time so that the facilities gen-
erating waste can be educated on 
new procedures and regulations. 

Golding said that drawbacks to 
the ordinance will not be known 
"until it's been actually used for a 
while . .. it places more require-
ments on doctors .. , but people 
who represented the medical com-
munity on the task force were 
very' supportive." 

John Giebink, director of the 
UCSD Student Health Center, 
said he supports the ordinance. 
According to him, three years ago 
the Health Center responded to 
the problem of where to dispose 
of infectious waste by contracting 
with a firm, and said that the 

ordinance is "a precaution that 
good judgement would require." 

RALLY 
Continued from pale j 

"To be stabbed in the back by 
another candidate on election day, 
I think, is very unfair," Robison 
said. "I'm sure it's politically 
motivated. W 

"J wish I was allowed to speak," 
he said, explaining that, "I ... 
openly supported the [WRC] in 
Council this year." 

In previous interviews Robison, 
while admitting his presence at 
the fraternity event, has denied 
any role in its planning or appro-
val of its content.

No UCLA student reported 
measles after the game, and the 
USC outburst eventually died off. 

Even if immunized, a person 
can contract measles if the vacci-
nation was received before 1970 
when less reliable medicines were 
used, Frederick said. 

He urges a second dose. "It 
doesn't hurt to be re-immunized ." 

ROBISON 
Continued from page I 
reasons. 

"I was very nervous. [Frater-
nity members) were not there to 
enjoy the show. The reason that 
we were there was to make sure 
that things didn't get out of hand," 
he said . 

Robison said he agreed with 
charges that the event was sexist , 
and questioned its overall value. 

"When I was vice president of 
the fraternity we did not schedule 
oil wrestling for rush events. I 
don't think that's appropriate .... 
I think one-on-one events are 
much more valuable ... where 
you talk to people instead of 
entenain them," he said. 

Robison said that holding the 
event on campus, a move which 
disturbed the UCSD administra-
tion, was "probably our biggest 
mistake in our history," but said 
that he feels such incidents require 
fair examination . 

"Everyone is entitled to the fair 
procedures. It's unfair to form a 
lynch mob . . .. That attitude may 
have been taken for this. Every-
one has their rights to a free trial, 
regardless of how awful or great 
the event was," he said. 

In regard to the upcoming 
run-off elections, Robison said he 
hoped the event would not affect 
his campaign, and urged voters to 
"j udge a man by his character, not 
his affiliation." 

Ramirez said the event "brought 
up a women's issue," and com-
mented that"l don't see Robison 
as being insensitive to women's 
issues." 

Ramirez added that he hopes 
students would see that the event 
was "just one incident and. possi-
bly, just one fraternity and not 
blame the whole Greek system, 
especially now when they're try-
ing to change a lot of miscon- ' 
ceptions."

Chilean Writer Draws on Personal Life 

By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
COlllribur ing Fl'alurl'S Edilor 

" W hen I write, I feel the 
forces that I can not 
control. Stra nge 

things happen to me all the time, 
thing that I cannot,explain. 

"It is true that I write because 
for me it is unavoidable. It i a 
matter of urvival. If I don't write, 
I die." 

In a few sentences, Chilean 
writer Isabel Allende ha said a 
great deal about herself. Her 
works reveal profundity, passion, 
and a journey into the surreal. 

Speaking on campus Thursday 
night, Allende shared her per-
onal, political, and literary ex-

periences with an audience of 
~e\eral hundred San Diegans . 

"Tonight I would like to talk 
about the meaning of writing, a 
theme that has been in m mind 
for a short while. let's say 20 or 30 
years,fl aid Allende," hose humor-
ow, words were delivered without 
deviation from the thoughtful tone 
he maintained throughout most 

of the evening. 
"The opportunity to prepare this 

conversation with you ha been 
"ery important to me," Allende 
continued. ·'It has forced me to 
organi7e my confused emotions, 
and to put in words those concepts 
that have been \\ ith me for a long 
time." 

For Allende, there are no 

divi ions between concepts of 
rea lity and fantasy. T hey become 
one and the arne. Writing and 
the world beco me personal 
definitions. products of Allende's 
thought. 

" I ca n no longer distinguish 
reality from fantasy:' Allende 
said . ''The limit is a blurred line. 
Everything happens from fantastic 
event and, in turn, the atmo -

" The main character 
of my first novel writes 
as she would like the 
world to be. I feel that 
way tOO." 

- Isabel Allende 

phere of books is saturated with 
reality. Everything is possible." 

Expanding on her world view 
and the lack of boundaries in it, 
Allende draws similaritie between 
herself and literary characters. 

"Eva Luna, the main character 
of my first novel, says that she 
writes as she would like the world 
to be and that she lives her life like 
a novel. I feel that way too." 

In the 1982 novel, La coso de 
los espiritus, Allende indirectly 
incorporate many of the political 
event that deeply affected her 
life. Her second book, De all/or y 

Clownin' A round - The Hobo's Casuals gang hams it up.

"Fashion involves making

Allende received news that her 
grandfather was dying, and she

letter, never to be sent. developed 
into Allende's first book. The 
book has been compared to a 
novel by the well-known Colum-
bian writer Gabriel Garcia Mar-
quez. 

I n telling about her child hood , 
Allende again reveals her peculiar, 
shocking sense of humor . Through-
out her lecture. she continue to 
emphasize her love for her family . 

"I was brought up in the house 
of my grand parents," Allende 
explai ned . "I was broug ht up to

way. 

"The house was an old, large 
somber place inhabited by weird 
people and benevolent spirits. I

was very fortunate because with 
uch relative, I don't need to

The tone of her voice becomes 

playful, yet amidst roaring laugh-
ter, she hesitate to smile.

power in literature. She pointed

Student Recalls Dartmouth Days 
By DAVID WOLFSON 
COllIribUling Wriler 

I froze my butt offin Dartmouth, I'll admit it. When I walked 
off the airpla ne and it was 10 

degrees, I knew I was in trouble. 
Even with its cold weather, 

Dartmouth is con idered to be 
one of the top academic institu-
tions in the United States. It has a 
very incredible social life, with so 
many extracu rricular activitie 
and spectator sports, it is rea lly 
amaling that anyone gets a ny 
studying done at all. 

Winter quarter was spent in the 
s now at Hanover, ew Hamp-
shire. During my stay. I began to 
realize there is more to academic 
life than what UCSD has to offer. 

Tradition run deep at Dart-
mouth, including certain types of 
beer-drinking rituals that might 
sca re quite a few folks. Beer bel-
lies are rampant , and alcoholism 
is frequently seen. While partyi ng 
is a st rong Dartmouth tradition, I 
learned that there was certainly 
more to Dartmouth than j ust 
drinking. 

Everythi ng about Dartmouth 
College it c1asse , st udent 
body, faculty, and campus is 
mall. I really believe that my high 
~chool is bigger than Dartmouth 
overall. UCS D is an immense 
school, near a large city, with 
comfortable weather year around . 
Dartmouth ollege is in a tiny 
rinky-dink town in the middle of 
the forest with !.ea~onal weather 
ranging from -30 degrees in the 
winter to hot , humid days in the 
~ummer months. 

One big difference between the 
two chools . is the community 
atmosphere of the two schools. 
UCSD students live on campus 
usually at least their first year, 
and about 40 percent of all stu-
dents live on campu at one t ime. 
Almost all Dartmouth students, 
no matter what year, live on cam-
pus, and this create a tight com-
munity among the students. 
- Politically, the Dartmouth 
students seem to be more liberal 

Dartmouth has these 
secret societies where 
the only way to be-
come a member is to 
b e 'tapped~ ~ or asked 
to j o in. 

than UCSD tudents, and cer-
tainly more vocal. 

At Dartmouth a normal class 
load is three cla ses a quarter, and 
it's easy to drop to the minimum 
two classes a nd cruise by. While I 
feel UCSD is academically intense 
and the students are very se rious 
about their studies, it seems that 
at Dartmouth the object is to 
tudy hard , party hard. 

Dartmouth has everything that 
UCSD doesn't . and U SD has 
all that Da rtmouth lacks. What 
are the bad parts of Dartmouth? 
Dartmouth is a private sc hool, 
where eliti m can be seen every-

where. It is very male-oriented and 
dominated and the men are cer-
tainly sexist. 

Fraternities domi nate the social 
life in Dartmout h (you decide if 
that is good or bad), and they 
certainly do not here. The movie 
"Animal House" is supposedly 
based on Dartmouth frate rn ity 
life, they say t here. I have seen 
stuff done in frate rnities that 
wou ld not even make the movie. I 
objected to the hazing the frater-
nities practiced . 

I was not too hip o n all the 
Dartmouth trad itions, including 
the secret societies. Dartmouth 
has these secret societies where 
the on ly way to become a member 
is to be " ta pped ," or asked to join. 
Former me mbers secretly choose 
their succeed ing members, a nd 
their membership a nd purpose is 
completely unk nown. These so-
cieties have buildings on campus 
and t he administrat ion a llows them 
to exist . 

Many frien ds have asked me 
which of t he two schools I prefer. 
I wou ld choose UCSD. UCSD is 
a hell of a lot cheaper than Dart-
mouth (it costs up to $21,000 a 
year there now) , and the educa-
tion is better here anyway. 

There are a few things though 
that I did learn about Dartmouth, 
that can and should be applied at 
UCS D . Dartmouth was not per-
fect, but it did have its benefits, 
and not just in terms of social life. 

First of a ll , I have realized that 
the areer ervices enter here is 
laCking . The corporate recruiting

belong to a different culture, where 
these things would never happen." 

Allende, who spent her ad-
olescence in Bolivia, Europe, and 
the Middle East, believes that a 
users of powerful tools , words, 
writers must recognize certai n 
obligations. "The idea that there 
is some power in the written word 
can be a very heavy responsi-
bility," she noted . 

Allende questioned on a deeper, 
more existential level: "So, I have 
been asking myself why do I 
write? What is the meaning of 
writing'! And in order to explain 
t he meaning, I have to start by 
asking myself what is the meaning 
of life. 

"Ultimately, I am what I write. 
Therefore, I must define myself as 
a human being in order to discover 
why I write. " 

Offering her perception of 
reality, Allende incorpordtes her 
experiences into her work. " In the 
daily exercise of trying to interpret 
reality , not only in physical 
dimension but metaphysical for-
ces, I have learned something 
about t he passion and the idea 
that moves people. In my writing, 
I try to understand the world, to 
make in more tolerable, and , if 
possible, to change it." 

Allende endeavors to bring 
about social change through unity. 
"There is nothing to be afraid of. 
We can share and kiss each other. 
There are many more imilarities 

that bring us together than 
differences that separate us ." 

E pou ing socialist views, she 
is critical of many aspects of 
modern society, particularly cap-
italist values. 

"Our kids are offered a cynical 
view of ociety where to compete 
is better than to share. free 

((Ultimate/y~ I am 
what I write. I must 
define myself as a hu-
man being in order to 
discover why I write. n

enterprise is more important than 
free men, and money is the diet. 
Where being called a liberal , a 
humanist or a virgin are insults; 
where commitment and generosity 
are consid e red naive ; where 
kindness and sent iments are 
scorned; a nd where love is out of 
fashion." 

Allende, who is in her late 40 , 
feels strong ties to her native 
Latin America . She looks at the 
political unrest in terms of the 
damage to the citizens, speaking 
"of revolutions made with ma-
chetes, bullets, poems and kisses. 

" I co me from a land of great 
contrasts where people have to 
survive great violence to find the 
meaning for living," she co n-
tinued . "Although in a typical 
socie tal reality. life is often sus-
pended from a very fragile thread." 

Allende maintains a positive 
outlook, expressing her vision of 
a benevolent future in which peace 
and community prevai l. As she 
concluded her lecture, Allende 
began to a nswer the questions she 
had pondered as a writer, activist, 
and concerned human being. 

"I don't k now the meaning of 
my life apart from love, which 
seems to be the ult imate reason for 
my existence. But I am begin ning 
to discover the purpose of writing. 
It is true that the written word has 
some power. Writers can achieve 
it to change the world . 

" I have an ambition to improve 
the world and the use my writing 
in the achievement of my goals. 
Maybe I can contribute to create 
a more gentle way of living. We 
will ee that everyone of us 
together can make a real rev-
olution of the spirit. We should all 
join in an effort to relieve those 
facts that prevent a more benev-
olent world where love for each 
other and love for this planet and 
its creatures will prevail. 

"Once Gabriel Garcia Marquez 
aid that he writes so that his 

friend s will love him more. I write 
so that people will love each other 
more." 

S hirley C hisholm - Former Congresswoman Shirley Chi holm 
poke in the Price Center Ballroom Friday night. In her lecture, 

"Affirmative Action : Into the 90s," Chisholm denounced com-
mon beliefs surrounding affirmative action, explaining that it is 
not intended to be a quota system. She criticized modern society, 
which she sees as white male dominated , for not making full use 
of the talents of all its members. Chisholm, who in 1968 became 
the first black woman elected to Congress, is currently focusing 
her efforts on bringing cultural and gender di versit y to both the 
student and faculty levels of uni ve rsities, noting that the universi-
ties must increase efforts to recruit the underrepre ented . An 
activist in the most literal sense of the word, Chisholm has 
written several books dealing with racism and sexism.

Major fashion companie , such 
as Jimmy Z and Ocean Pacific, 
participate in these shows, which 
attract "buyer " or tore represen-
tative , who purchase masse of 
clothes or just look for new fashion 
trend~ . 

Beach attribute much of their 
success to these shows. He des-
cribed them as places where 
innovative idea can spread 
quickly, drawing the attention of 
buyers. 

Hobo's Casuals has already 
participated in several shows. The 
Long Beach Action ports, Re-
tailer Company and the Los Ang-
eles " Magic how," the world' 
largest fashion show, are just a 
few of the shows that enabled 
Hobo's Ca uals to expand nation-
ally and internationally. 

Buyers from West Germany, 
Italy, Japan and Tahiti as well as 
the United States fill their tores 
with the laid-back California 
surf style of Hobo's Casuals. 

Because Hobo's Casuals now 
sell to buyers from all over the 

But Sae determines the loose, 
comforta ble cuts . After drawing a 
certain pattern, Saeand company 
send it and the material to profe -
sional tailors who sew the thou-
sands of pant and T-shirt that 
are later stored in a warehou e 
and sent to the buyers. 

Though Hobo's Casuals defi-
nitely benefits from the shows, 
these same show ' are also a market 
for wide-spread plagiarism. 

"Fashion is all about copying. 
The minute you [present] some-
thing at a show, it becomes public 
and anyone ca~ use [the design). 
Copyright laws [allow] 10 percent 
variation, so if anyone were to 
copy, all they'd have to do is 
change the cut by just a touch or 
change the color of the stitching," 
Beach said. 

~ MANUFACTURERS 
~ HANOVER 

With plagiarism, contracts, and 
dishonest buyers, the fashion bus-
iness may sou nd cutthroat and 
strcssful. The partners of Hobo's 
Casua ls, however, do not fit the 
stereotype image of high-strung-
t pe businesspersons. 

Attitudes of California cool and 
the unstructured elegance of jaZL 
strongly influence their line of 
clothing. For example, their 
" bowling pants" have the very 
100 efit.anddraw tringwaistthat 
generally characterize Hobo's 
Casuals pants. This style also fea-
tures bright, bold, bowling pins 
and geometrical shapes scattered 
again t a dark blue background. 

"The [design] is cool but cas-
ual, stylish but very low-key. The 
bowling pants are relatively low-
key. Much of our stuff are really 
bright plaids and loud stuff, but 
it's all done in a low-key vein. 
When you put them on, you first 
think, 'whoa, they look pretty 
f UIIIIY,' but then they become your 
favorite pair of pants," Beach 
said . 

Like jazz, [the design] is really 
complex and loose, but at the 
same time it's structured."

iness game, these three UCSD

students have kept the good 
humorthat created Hobo's Casu-
als . Perhaps it's their relaxed, 
uninhibited attitude that attracts 
the buyers. At one show, for 
example, their booth consisted of 
a pool table rather than the usual 
fare of bikini-clad models. 

As Beach said: "We like to do 
unconventional things." 

Smart 

Help~ur parents 
get through 
college. 

Just thinking about college tuition is 
enough to make most pa rents break into 
a sweat. 

But can you blame them? When you 
consider the cost of tuition, books, 
dorms- not to mention pizza parties-
you're talking big bucks. . 

Which is why you should do some 
talking. Like telling your parents about 
the Education Loan Programs at 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust. 

At MHT, not only do we participate 
in all three Federally guaranteed loan 
programs, but we also work with state 
and nationa I agencies and can make 
guaranteed loans in all 50 states. 

In practically no time at all. 
In a matter of minutes, MHT Student 

Loan Processors can program your 
information into our computerized loan-
processing system. 

Within 24 hours, the Bank will get a 
decision from the Guarantee Agency. 
It's that simple. Better still , with MHT 
your parents will get all the money they 
need from one source. 

Example: If your folks need more 
money than government sources will 
give them, we can offer them tailor-made 
payment plans through The Education 
Loan Program, Educational Lines of 
Creditor Monthly Budget Program and 
Pre·Payment Programs that make it 
easy for your parents to fund themselves. 
(The Education Loa n Program, Monthly 
Budget and Pre·Payment Programs are 
offered through the Tuition Plan , a 
company of Manufacturers Hanover.) 

Once you get a loan from us, you can 
be su re it 'll s tay with us. Because we've 
never sold education loans to other 
ba n k!. (unless the horrower asked us to). 

So if you n ed money for school , call 
1-800-MHT-G RAD and get your!ielf 
an MHT Education Loan Applica tion . 

Then when your folks ask YOli about 
tuition, at ](>o:-.t you'll haw an answer.

The UCSD Guardian 

Life at Dartmouth' 
Continued from page 10 
that goes on at this school is 
absurd and we have minimal 
resources . The Career Center 
should be just as or more impor-
tant than any department or 
laboratory. At Dartmouth their 
career center has so many resour-
ces; it looks like a library. If the 
administration could only have 
funneled some of the money that 
went to the appearance of the Cen-
ter to acquire more resources and 
attract more recruiters, everyone 
would be better off. 

At Dartrpouth they say you do 

not just go there for four years, 
but for life. I realize that it takes a 
long time for loyalty to a univer-
sity to develop, but it has to start 
somewhere. Our University is divi-
ded into colleges, with nothing to 
unite the student body. But what 
could unite the students? A lack 
of school spirit is directly related 
to the lack of high profile sports 
teams (specifically football and 
basketball). 

Sports are big at Dartmouth , 
and I attended my first collegiate 
sporting event at Dartmouth, not 

FEATURES 
at UCSD. It's fun to get wild and 
cheer for a team. No sport, no 
piril. No caring about UCSD. 

When students do not care about 
UCSD, they will care even less as 
alumni . It is just that simple. 
Monetarily speaking, the alums _ !O'= ... 
of Dartmouth contribute an I 
incredible amount, and that helps 
the University immensely. 

On the whole, Dartmouth is a 
strong school and a hell of a lot 
of fun. I learned a lot about 
myself and about UCSD at 
Dartmouth. As UCSD moves into 
the '9Os. it must try to improve in 
all area in order to attract better 
students and faculty. Only then 
will we be considered a top aca-
demic insti tution.

thrilled with the women's surpris-

the critical role of team co-captain 
Julie Mattison. Mall ison, who 
has been suffering from injurie 
and most recently was pulled from 
the li neup because of the flu , has 
been a source of motivation for 
the team in past weeks. "Nine 
people got the ride, but ten made 
tha t boat go fast!" Vallarga re-
marked. 

The varsity win capped a day 
fi lled with triumphs for the 
women's team: the novice A boat 
edged out the competition at 6:05, 
novice lightweights cruised to vic-
tory at 6:08.2, and the novice B 
boat flew down the course with a 
6:16 finish . The single loss for the 
women came in the open 8 race, 
where UCSD went up against a 
club boat and lost. 

Conversely, the men's team had 
but one victory. Both the junior 
varsity and the novice A boats

after his 6-4, 6-4 singles victory. In 
fact, the Tritons did not lose a set 
to Stanislaus in the eight matches 
that were played. 

"Our goal was to get to Na-
tionals and be competitive against 
teams like U C Santa C ruz," 
sophomore John Park stated. 
"With some favora ble polling in 
the tournament, we have a good 
chance to win it all." 

On Thursday and Friday, the 
Tritons will travel to Claremont 
to face sixth-and sevent h-ranked 
Pomona- Pitzer University and

The UCSD Guardian 

W. W-Polo 
Continued from page 24 
in the first period , to take a quick 
3-0 lead over U CS B. It was a lead 
the Tritons would never relin-
quish. 

The Tritons, the nation's top 
seed in Division III , then pro-
ceeded to tire out the third-ranked 
Gauchos with their fast paced 
play, and cruised to a final 7-4 
margin. 

Harper, however, was quick to 
point out that even though some 
of the other teams at the tourna-
ment could not keep up with the 
Tritons, his team till has room 
for improvement. Frequently 
screaming at his players. Harper 
hopes that they wi ll learn one of 
the virtues paramount to their 
success in Nationals - patience. 

"We've been shooting with 30 
seconds left on the shot clock . 
We've got to make them play 
some defense," Harper said. 

A good test of how far the Trit-
ons have progressed towards their 
goal of a national championship 
will come this Saturday when 
they face two of the best women's 
waterpolo teams in the world, the 
USA National A team, and the 

Hungarian national squad at 
Canyonview pool. 

UCSD, who has five players on 
the National B team (Jefi Paulsen, 
Jamie Dailey, Brenda Reiton, 
Carin Crawford and Kristen Lar-
son), will meet the USA A team at 
II a.m. and the Hungarians at 6 
p.m., following a Hungary-USA 
exhibition game Friday at 7 p.m. 

SPORTS 
The Hungarian team, whose 

players receive nearly $30,000 a 
year and train year-round , prom-
ise to give the Tritons a tough 
game. 

"They're bigger, stronger, and 
more experienced than us, so it'll 
definitely be a learning experi-
ence," Harper pointed out. 

Peter M.~::~ ",uorruran 
Christy Cheney (right) and Robin Bellamy finished second and third, 
respectively, for the Tritons in the 1 DO-meter hurdles.

Giselle English (800 meters), Vicki

In addition to Lawler's national

Suffering from injuries to

Triton men could not manage any

Triton Sports Update ... 
Softball 

The Tritons, ranked third in 
the country and second in the 
West, swept a non-conference 
doubleheader at Occidental on 
Saturday, 13-12and8-1. Withthe 
victories, the Tritons improve to 
24-7 on the season. 

In the first game, Ka thy Fogg 
struck out six and Julie Stillman 
was two-for-three with three RBI 
and a triple to lead UCSD. In the 
second ga me, Pam Harnack's 
three-for-four, four RBI perfor-
mance led the Tritons. 

Michelle Mundy went five-for-
eight on the day for the Tritons, 
whose next game is a home dou-
bleheader on Friday against UC 
Riverside. 
Baseball

UCSD jumped out to an early 

6-0 lead in its game against 
Southern Ca lifornia College. 
However, the team could not keep

tion and fell apart on defens_e, 
committing five errors. Rick 
Rupkey (7-3) was an undeserving 
loser as five of the seven runs he 
allowed were unearned. 

Triton pitcher Mike Morgan 
(4-7) conti nues to struggle. In two 
and two-thi rds ineffective innings, 
the pitcher allowed seven of the 
Gulls' fifteen runs. Morgan was 
followed by J.J. Fisher, Chris 
Murphy, Gary Fessia, and Kevin 
Willett. Of those, only Fessia was 
effective, pitching one and two-
thirds innings of hitless relief. 

15-5 Whipping of Chapman Col-
lege on Friday. 

The match pitted two teams 
going in very different directions. 
Chapman is dropping its vol-
leyball program at the conclusion 
of the season due to lack of funds, 
and its players just seemed to be 
going through the motions . 
UCSD, on the other hand, is 
probably playing its best volley-
ball all year. The reuslts of the 
match reflected the directions the 
two programs are heading. 

The Tritons' middle attack of 
John Davey and John Lim re-
mained virtually unstoppable 
while Kenny Blackman added a 
team-leading nine kills as the team 
quickly rolled over its outmatched 
opponents.

Tritons Slam Cal St. San Bernardino 
Women's Tennis Now ]4-4 After Easy Victory 

By DAVID POTICHA 
Staff Writer 

On aturdayaftemoon the mem-
bersoftheUC Dwomen' tennis 
team were erving bagels for 
lunch. No, it wasn't a picnic, but 
rather a feast of a terribly poor 
Cal State San Bernardino squad. 

oming right on the heels of an 
easy victory over Colorado Col-
lege, the Tritons (14-4) were not 
even challenged, and barely broke 
a sweat in the 9-0 rout. 

How bad was this San Bernar· 
dino team? Firs t, the Tritons did 
not lose a si ngle set in the match . 

econd, the Tritons won, in total 
games, 10 -II. In fact , the reason 
that San Bernard ino won as many 
as II games is because the Tritons 
were having trouble staying focused 
against their inferior opponents. 

la ney Calhoun, playing num· 
ber two, pointed out that " It's 
hard to play against a weak team. 
When the ball is coming at you in 
slow motion it gives you too 
much time to think about what 
you are going to do ... it's easier 
to make mistakes." 

Sixth·seeded Amanda Lynch 
agreed that the Tritons are 
" tough," but also worried since 

the Tritons "next match is agai nst 
USD, who is good , so we didn't 
get much preparation ." 

When asked to comment on 
San Bernardino, number one 
player Chri tine Be hrens and 
number three player Julie Ber-
man, both of whom blanked their 
opponents, declined to comment. 

However, like the rest of the 
team, these players were quickly 
off the court. 

The Tritons play at USD on 
Monday, and will conclude their 
regular season up at Occidental 
on Saturday. The Nationals will 
take place from Ma y 8·13 in 
Claremont, CA. 

Men's Tennis Sweeps 
Weekend Matches 
By JONCARLO MARK 
Staff Writer 

The men' tennis team hand· 
ily defeated the visiting Uni· 
ver ity of Redlands and Cal 
State Stani laus this weekend 
with only two more matches 
left before the Division III 
Nationals. 

The Tri tons entered play 
with a fifth place ranking while 
Redlands had cracked the top 
15 during the year. Friday's 7-2 
victory over Redlands was 
clinched early as UCSD grab-
bed a 5-1 advantage after sin-
gles play, 

No. I singles player Sig 
Huber scored a 6-4, 6-1 victory 
while No.2 Francis Monnar 
breezed 6-0, 6-3 . Other straight 
set wins were delivered by Chris 
Belloli, John Park and J eff 
French. 

Doubles play saw the Huber-
Belloli combo di pose of Red-
land 's No. I team 6-3,6-3 while 
Randy Mark and Tim Ditzler 
teamed up for an impressive 
6-0, 6-0 win. 

The Stanislaus team fell to 
the Tritons even harder by an

Tritons Wash Out Competition at U CSD Invite 

Women's Water Polo Denies UCSB to Cap Off Undefeated Weekend Tournament 
By CH RI ZAHARIAS 
taff Writer 

The way the UC D women's 
waterpolo team ha been thra h-
ing it opponent lately, one beg-
in to wonder why an team even 
bother to schedule invitation to 
play them. 

Fortunately for the Triton, 
however, there were enough 
coache with a rna ochi tic de ire 
to ee their players uffer, 0 the 
UCSD Invitational took place at 
Canyon iew Pool on aturda 
and unday. And if you were a 
coach other than D' Denny 
Harper, uffering wa about all 
you aw. 

The Triton wept all five of the 
game, including a 7-4 deci ion 
over UC anta Barbara in the 

champion hip game, to win the 
tournament for the econd year in

Still No Banner for U CSD 
At City Championships 
By CARl ICK 
Staff Writer 

It wa not a banner day for 
UCSD crew. Despite an im-
pres ive performance by the 
Triton women at the an Diego 
City Rowing Championship 
yesterday morning, the defeat 
of the men's varsity boat was 
deci ive. The Triton blue and 
gold banner ha yet to reign 
atop the boathouse wall, as 
USD, for the second year in a 
row captured the main race. 

The San Diego Rowing 
Championship Regatta pit 
three area schools, SDSU, 
USD, and UCSD, against each 
other to determine the best 
among San Diego crew. Besides 
offering tremendous competi-
tion, the regatta is a "grudge 
match" of sorts. 

With the three rival schools 
rowing out of the same boat-
house, tensions have been know 
to flare. The City Champion-
ships event, therefore, serves as 
a release for both coaches and 
rower while giving the victors 
the bragging rights of the 
boathouse. 

The boathouse wall displays 
these rights. While banners 
from each school hang as dec-
oration, the school that wins 
the men's varsity event nails its 
banner on top. 

With school pride in mind, 
the UCSD men's team shuffled 
lineups last week. The Tritons 

combined the heavyweight and 
lightweight boat, resulting in 
new varsity and junior var ity 
boats. 

In the main event, UC D 
varsity shot off the line with 
USD and battled down the 
1700-meter cour e, a State fell 
to a distant third. At 1000-
meter , the Tritons had lost 
some ground, but were still 
close. 

USD then sprinted, taking 
even seats, and powered over 

the finish with the victory. 
UCSD crossed econd, five 
seconds behind at 5: 10.5, fol-
lowed by SDSU. 

Although the men lost the 
"banner" race, Triton women 
claimed the cup. Having gone 
through its own boat reorgani-
zation due to illness, the 
women's varsity was a bit ap-
prehensive before the race. 

It did not show. The Tritons 
tore down the bay and took an 
early lead on USDand SDSU. 
With 700 meters to go, UCSD 
had a bow to stern lead on the 
USD Toreros. 

The Toreros, however, were 
not out of it. They tarted 
sprinting, moving quickly on 
the Tritons. Although it ap-
peared USD would take com-
mand , UCSD powered the last 
250 meters and held on for a 
three-second win, with a time 
of 5:51 .2.

Women Flourish While Men Fall in Track Meet 

U CSD Splits at Point Loma 
By PHIL GRUEN 
sports Editor 

The UCSD women's track and 
field tea m won 10 of t he 16 events, 
including two each by Yvette 
Marzullo, Andrea Kouremetis, 
and Shannon Quigley, to defeat 
Point Lorna l'!azarene in a dual 
meet Saturday at Point Lorna, 
77-58. 

The men's team did not fare as 
well, winning only four of the 
events in a 97-52 loss to Point 
Lorna. There was a definite bright 
spot for the men's team, however: 
Marc Lawler qualified for the 
Division III National Champion-
ships and tied a sc hool 
record when he cleared 15' I" in 
the pole vault. 

According to Triton Head 
Coach Mark Stanforth, it was a 
good meet for UCSD, particu-
larly for the women, and both the 
men's and women's teams got all 
the points he though po sible. 

For the women, Marzullo won 
both the long jump (16'4 W') and 
the 400 meter (I :00.6), while fin-
ishing second in the 200 meters to 
pace the Tritons . Marzullo's 
second place finish in the 200 was 
to teammate Kouremetis, who 
won the event with a 25:83 time. 

Kouremetis also won the 100
