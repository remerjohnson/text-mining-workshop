A rider bill attached to — and somewhat 
overshadowed by — President Barack Obama’s 
landmark health-care reform will remodel the 
student loan system by cutting out private lend-
ers and setting aside billions more in federal 
dollars for financial aid.

Currently, the U.S. government provides 
money to banks or corporations which arrange 
loans for students, then collect interest at a 

profit. According to the 
Congressional Budget 
Office, bypassing private 
lenders and giving loan 
funds directly to students 
will save the federal gov-
ernment $1 billion over the 
next year alone, and $62 bil-
lion over the next 10 years.

The vast majority of 
that $62 billion will be 
reinvested in Pell Grants, 
$13 billion of which will be 
devoted to increasing stu-
dent eligibility and avoiding 
a cap on the money students 
can receive. 

The additional funds 
will push the maximum 

award for the 2010-11 academic year from 
$5,350 to $5,500. The federal government is 
covering this increase and allowing for more 
like it by 2010 with $36 billion in additional aid.

Of the remaining $13 billion in government 
savings, $10 billion will go toward reducing the 
federal deficit and about $2.55 billion will go to 
institutions that serve minorities.

The larger health-care bill also affects stu-
dents with a provision that allows all Americans 
to stay on their parents’ health-care policy until 
age 26, instead of the more typical 19.

The University of California 
will pay back $38 million in fees to 
students in professional programs, 
after a San Francisco Superior Court 
judge ruled on March 10 that the 
university had raised fees illegally 
from 2003 to 2007.

According to evidence present-
ed throughout the case, — Andrea 
Luquetta et. al v. Regents of the 
University of California — official 
university documents, including an 
online fee guide, stated that fees 
would not be increased for continu-
ing students at any point throughout 
their period of enrollment. 

The court ruled that these mate-
rials constituted a contract, which 
the university then violated.

“The contract between the plain-
tiff students and the university 
included a binding commitment not 
to raise the professional degree fees 
for continuing students,” Superior 
Court Judge John Munter said in a 
statement.

The ruling applies to nearly 
3,000 students who enrolled in UC 
professional schools — including 
law, business and medicine — before 
August 25, 2003.

Four students from schools such 
as the UCLA School of Law and 
UCSF School of Medicine contacted 
law firm Altshuler Berzon LLP in 
2007 to take up their case against the 
university.

Danielle Leonard, who works 
for the firm, said that while fee 
increases may be necessary, students 
must be informed of the possibility 
of such increases before they go into 
effect. In this case, students were not 
notified

“The court concluded that the 
university had breached its contracts 
with the students for the price 
of their education, because the 
university had promised to keep the 
amount of the professional degree 
fee constant for the period of their 
enrollment, and then violated that 
promise,” Leonard said.

Over the last several years, 
the university has raised fees for 
both undergraduate and graduate 
students systemwide to account for 
state budget cuts. 

Those affected by the case will 
receive up to $8,000, an amount 
that has sharply increased during

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee

that hit Chile Feb. 27, a quake so strong 
it moved the entire city of Concepción 
more than 10 feet to the west. 

According to Restrepo, Chile’s 
earthquake-proof construction codes 
— which he addressed while in Chile 
— helped the country avoid the total 
devastation that Haiti experienced 
several weeks earlier.

Restrepo worked 
with structural engineers 
and architects in Chile 
to advise a committee of 
city officials drafting new 
codes to make buildings 
earthquake-proof.

“We were deciding if 
the buildings had to be 
demolished or had to be 
repaired for people to be 
able to safely inhabit them,” 
he said. Following his recommenda-
tions, city officials had a better idea 
of how to draft strong building codes. 

City officials throughout the coun-
try enforce design codes, or standards 
that control how quickly buildings can 
respond to earthquakes. Restrepo said 
the latest earthquake — the fifth larg-
est ever recorded, according to the U.S. 
Geological Survey — caused remark-
ably little damage considering its scale. 

“I don’t recall any earthquakes of 

this magnitude causing such little dam-
age, actually,” he said. “Less than 1,000 
people died due to this earthquake of 
magnitude 8.8. If you look at the recent 
earthquake in Haiti and compare the 
catastrophe, you see the importance of 
the structures and codes.”

In the aftermath of the earthquake, 
architects and engineers observed the 

most substantial damage to 
older buildings that lacked 
load-bearing walls — a 
common fate for build-
ings constructed before 
seismic design codes were 
increased. 

“The overall perfor-
mance in Chile is very 
good,” Restrepo said. 
“They have very good 
engineering, good codes 
and good practices. The 

architects are well-trained, too. Their 
practice is very similar to the U.S.”

However, Chile’s second-largest 
city, Concepción, was still strongly 
affected by the earthquake due to 
its location near the coast. The city 
was also hit by a resulting tsunami — 
caused by a slip in tectonic plates dur-
ing the earthquake — that reportedly 
reached as far as Antarctica. 

“The city of Concepción was hit 
very hard. The whole city was on 

shaky ground,” Restrepo said. “They 
are addressing the damaged and fallen 
buildings, but Concepción may have 
significant problems with sewage — 
and the piping will need to be opened 
and inspected.” 

Following the disaster, scien-
tists from the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography explored the quake’s 
rupture site to investigate the theory 
that it had been caused by changes in 
sea floor movements. 

“Scripps decided to take on this 
expedition because of a series of oppor-
tune events,” graduate student in geo-
physics and geology Ashlee Henig said 
in a statement. “Such a rapid response 
to an event like the large earthquake 
allows scientists to get excellent data 
on the direct effects of the earthquake.”

According to Henig, the Scripps 
research vessel Melville was near the 
epicenter of the earthquake at the time 
it struck, allowing it to examine rup-
tures and landslides. 

Using a sea floor imaging system, 
the team of scientists worked with 
Chilean and German researchers to 
compare the images with those cap-
tured before the earthquake. In addi-
tion, four GPS receivers were deployed 
to measure any small sea floor changes 
that occur as the earthquake rupture 
settles.

“These receivers will be collected 
on a return cruise after several months 
of recording the sea floor,” said Henig. 
“The GPS receivers will provide insight 
into the post-seismic movements of 
the floor, so we can learn about the 
earthquake rupture and movement of 
the plates.”

Another part of the expedition will 
include searching for landslides that 
may have triggered the tsunamis fol-
lowing the earthquake. 

The expedition was completed last 
Thursday. They are now processing 
and analyzing the data they collected.

“The data will hopefully provide 
us with insight into subduction related 
earthquakes and related co-seismic and 
post-seismic deformation,” Henig said.

According to Restrepo, if an earth-
quake were to hit California, buildings 
would be expected to perform better 
than, or at the same level as, Chile. 

Restrepo said that most of 
California would be safe in the case of 
an earthquake.

“California is well-prepared. But 
if an earthquake hit the West Coast, I 
don’t think Oregon and Washington 
are nearly as ready as us, or, as a matter 
of fact, as Chile,” he said.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS

Future victims of achalasia — a 
rare disease that makes it difficult 
to eat and can cause drastic weight 
loss — may no longer have to wear 
scars after surgery. Surgeons at 
UCSD Medical Center have per-
formed the first successful incision-
free myotomy in the U.S.

A myotomy is a surgery 
designed to reverse the effects of 
achalasia, which directly impacts 
the esophagus — the muscles lin-
ing the inside of the throat — by 
inhibiting the ability to swallow 
and making it difficult for patients 
to carry food down their stomachs. 
In addition, the lower esophagus 
sphincter — the muscle that relaxes 
to let food through, then contracts 
to keep stomach acids from back-
ing into the esophagus — tightens, 

making it difficult for food to get 
to the stom-

ach. When this happens, achalasia 
patients can experience chest pains, 
and often regurgitate their food.

John Slepicka, a patient who 
offered himself up for the trial 
noninvasive surgery, lost 30 pounds 
over the two years that he suffered 
from achalasia, and found that 
other surgeries did not work for 
him.

“Over time, I could not eat the 
foods I love,” Slepicka said. “I could 
no longer go to restaurants. My 
friends said I looked unhealthy. 
When I tried to eat, the food would 
get stuck in my throat. I would 
swallow air or stand up to get the 
food down.”

According to Santiago Horgan, 
chief of minimally invasive surgery 
at UCSD and the doctor who per-
formed the myotomy, there are two 
ways achalasia can manifest. The 
first is through a parasitic infection 
— more common with patients in 
Latin America. In the U.S., however, 
achalasia is primarily a genetic 
disease.

Traditionally, to treat achalasia, 
surgeons made incisions in patients’ 
chests to gain access to the esopha-
gus and stomach. Then, using 
laparoscopic techniques — smaller 
incisions and the use of magnify-

ing lenses on probes inside 
the body — doctors cut 
long slits along the outer 
layer of the esophageal 
muscles.

These surgeries 
started from the lower 
esophagus sphincter 
and continued into 
the stomach, allowing 
food to pass through 
uninhibited. They 
required several 
days’ recovery time 
and often left scar-

ring.
When performing the minimally 

invasive surgery, Horgan and his 
team still made the incisions lapa-
roscopically — only this time, they 
went in through the mouth instead 
of a cut in the chest cavity.

 “With prior surgeries, my post-
operative pain was a 13 on a scale of 
one to 10,” Slepicka said. “Because 
this surgery was done without cuts, 
I don’t feel like I’ve even had a pro-
cedure.”

Horgan said he hopes the surgi-
cal innovation will mean shorter 
recovery time, less pain and smaller 
risk of infection for patients.  If so, 
according to Horgan, the procedure 
could become a standard treatment 
for achalasia. 

“The surgery is still in its trial 
stages,” Horgan said. “Only time 
will tell if it involves fewer risks.”

In 2008, alongside Dr. Gareth 
Jacobson (who also helped perform 
the recent myotomy) Horgan per-
formed California’s first minimally 
invasive gastric bypass through a 
patient’s mouth. Horgan then made 
headlines that same year when 
he performed an appendectomy 
by removing a patient’s appendix 
through her vagina and mouth. 

“With dramatic advancements in 
medical devices, we can now per-
form complex surgeries through the 
mouth with no external incisions,” 
Hogan said. “What we are seeing 
is the evolution of laparoscopic 
surgery into more specialized pro-
cedures that require no incisions at 
all. I believe that minimally invasive 
surgery is the future of surgeries. 
We can very well see incisionless 
heart or brain surgery in the com-
ing 20 to 30 years.”

If there’s one thing I’ve gathered from years of late-night “Girls Gone Wild” infomercials and 
annual MTV booze fests, it’s this: 
Spring break is not supposed to be a 
time for deep reflection. It is not a call 
to introspection nor an exploration 
of life’s great mysteries so much as an 
excuse to lose an inordinate number 
of brain cells/articles of clothing to 
tropical locales that host breakfast 
happy hours and outlaw T-shirts of 
the nonwhite variety. 

Except my spring break wasn’t 
anything like that. I didn’t lose any 
brain cells or pants, and I definitely 
didn’t enter any wet T-shirt contests. 
(But after a quarter-long grilled-cheese 
binge, I’d be in no shape for victory, 
anyway). No, I spent my week of 
leisure doing exactly what none of us 
should: freaking out about the future. 

After 11 weeks of last-minute essay 
writing and furious memorization, you 
might think we’d all be ready to throw 
caution and various articles of clothing 
to the wind and relax — but not me. 
See, in the brief absence of overdue 
papers and centuries of ancient his-
tory to learn, I found another object 
of grave concern, one common to 
those of us whose majors don’t end in 
“chemistry”: the creeping suspicion 
that in two years, with nothing but a 
literature degree from a school where 
fraternities throw racist parties and 
the admissions office accidentally tells 
every applicant they’re admitted, I’ll 
be forced to fashion a cozy cardboard 
abode from recycled Perks cups and 
Ted Baker shoe boxes. Or, even more 
appealing, move back home. 

When I informed my dad of 
these suspicions, he suggested that 
I make use of something called 
StrengthsFinder. It’s an online survey 
designed to identify natural talents 
through a comprehensive self-assess-
ment asking how much you identify

Dear Editor,
That was a very nice article you 

published on March 11, “The Melt 
is On — Don’t Stop the Heat.” 
Personally, I will take slightly cynical 
over super-serious news any day!

In regard to breaking free of the 
“free speech circle jerk”: as long the 
A.S. Council and other students 
on campus go after student media 
organizations based on their content, 
media organizations are going to keep 
using the First Amendment to defend 
themselves. I hope we can all accept 
that and move on. Instead, UCSD 
students should take our suggestions 
to heart and start their own publica-
tions against The Koala and whatever 
else they may find offensive. Seriously, 
UCSD would be a much better place 
if we all called each other out on our 
ignorance, bullshit and uptightness.

Also, you cannot judge us too 

harshly for having “wine garden(s)” 
instead of meetings because: 1) We 
had to listen to the VP of Finance 
and Resources explain his govern-
ment speech model and give horrible 
analogies, 2) He ignored us when we 
pointed out the obvious flaws to his 
plans and 3) We trusted our lawyers 
and First Amendment rights.

Dear Editor,
“To go to bed with satisfaction, 

one must wake up with 
determination” — Anonymous. 

I found this quote to be living true 
with the students of Compton High 
School. In light of the “Compton 
Cookout,” I felt it imperative to 
meet and understand the students 
who were the center of so much 

controversy. As a Black Student Union 
member at Westview High School, I 
knew there was more to the African-
American culture than the ignorance 
that was being portrayed.

On March 13, I was fortunate 
enough to travel to Compton High. 
I met some of Compton High’s best, 
those with a very bright future. As 
I spoke to the students, they told 
me of how Compton High has been 
stereotyped as only having gang 
members and drug dealers. They did 
acknowledge that the influence was 
there; however, it was a small minority 
of the students. Most of them want 
to get a good education to further 
themselves and the community. One 
of the students said he wanted to go to 
UCLA to study neurology to become 
a brain surgeon. His counselors 
helped him by arranging field trips for 
him to see the campus and showing 
him what he is working toward. 

These are some of the things that 
counselors have done at Compton 
High that go beyond the call of duty. 

They have pride and believe in their 
students.

All the students had big dreams, 
from becoming neurologists to 
engineers to pediatricians. The one 
thing that intrigued me was that 
all of them wanted to give back to 
their community in one shape or 
form. They felt very connected and 
committed to Compton. Although 
so many people stereotyped the 
Compton students and residents, 
these students work hard daily in 
the community and in school, giving 
back to the community by being role 
models for the younger generation. 
They are living daily to break through 
the labels and stereotypes while 
educating the real ignorance that 
exists. 

“We must try to help people to 
look beyond the smoke screen of 
ignorance to the essence of Compton 
[High] and the students attending 
it,” said Robert, the president of 
the Compton High Black Student 
Union. This statement was the most 

compelling of all to me. We are not  — 
nor will we ever be — the labels that 
we have been given. Though some 
of the students at UCSD, labeled a 
prestigious university, try to portray 
these students and the community in 
which they live as unintelligent, that 
could not be further from the truth. 
These students have a vision for a 
brighter tomorrow while working hard 
every day to better themselves and the 
community that has nurtured them.

STATE NEWS — California’s budget crisis is forc-
ing all sectors of our state to strap on their think-
ing caps and look for something — anything — 
to remedy the surmounting debt. 

One recent money-saving suggestion came 
from the University of California’s very own 
Senior Vice President for Health Sciences and 
Services, John Stobo. Stobo argued that contract-
ing state-prison health care to the UC system will 
save the state billions. But even if our university 
wasn’t already burdened with fewer staff and 
stretched resources, the proposal isn’t the surefire 
path to efficiency Stobo has made it out to be. 

After the 2001 court case Plata v. 
Schwarzenegger, a federal judge ruled that state 
inmates were entitled to better health care, then 
issued a federal receiver to oversee the progress. 
While the receiver is supposed to monitor the 
state’s progress, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 

feels that Kelso had overstepped his author-
ity. In March 2009, a federal judge denied 
Schwarzenegger’s request to terminate Kelso on 
the grounds that he overstepped his duties by 
demanding $8 billion to construct new prison 
hospitals — something the state obviously could 
not afford. Since then, prison health-care costs 
skyrocketed from $475 million to $2.4 billion 
annually. 

 Stobo’s plan would turn over all prison health-
care responsibilities to the UC system and the 
telemedical  company NuPhysicia, which sends a 
live stream from multiple examination rooms back 
to one doctor’s webcam headquarters. While it is 
certainly tempting to trained doctors without ever 
having to set foot in a hospital, the virtual network 
would eliminate hundreds of jobs in the pro-
cess. Instead of having real doctors take inmates’ 
heartbeats, UC physicians would diagnose them 

through a sort of advanced Skype for doctors. 
(YouTube “NuPhysicia” for a better idea of how it 
works. Pretty weird.) 

When NuPhysicia first took off in 2007, Strobo 
served as a founding chairman of its board of 
directors. After several allegations that Strobo is in 
it for personal gain, both the CEO and accountant 
of NuPhysicia have issued statements assuring the 
public that Strobo is “not a direct equity holder” of 
the company. But regardless of whether Strobo will 
benefit financially from employing NuPhysicia to 
streamline inmante care, it is undeniable that there 
is an enormous conflict of interest. NuPhysicia is 
Stobo’s brainchild — it’s only human to want one’s 
own brainchild to succeed at every possible turn.

When Schwarzenegger approached the regents 
about herding prisoners through the UC medical

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

with statements like “I relax easily” 
(“Strongly disagree”). 

Of course, the fact that the survey 
is only available after you’ve already 
paid $30 for a corporate self-help 
book (aptly titled “Now, Discover 
Your Strengths”) might have been 
cause for skepticism in some. But in 
a state of such certainty of my immi-
nent failure, I read on. 

The book’s chief message is a sim-
ple one: Rather than wasting a lifetime 
trying to improve our weaknesses, 
we all should focus on bettering our 
natural talents — the most prevalent 
of which, in my case, is apparently 
consistency. 

It’s true: Not only am I unfailingly 

late for everything, I also always order 
the same Subway foot-long. No mat-
ter how many sacrificed attendance 
points and undercooked chicken 
breasts it yields, this kind of predict-
able nature, StrengthsFinder asserts, 
is a virtue. I value “predictability and 
even-handedness,” and I should apply 
those to whatever profession in which 
I may find myself. 

Whether as a barista or burger-
flipper, applying my aptitude for 
consistency, the book insists, will be 
the key to affording higher rent than 
I’d pay for my shoebox — not try-
ing to improve my weaknesses in the 
hopeless pursuit of well-roundedness. 
This line of thinking might be a tough 
sell to the higher-ups responsible for 

making me take science, math and six 
quarters of world history, but it makes 
a whole lot of sense to me. Certain 
things I’ve never had much natural 
talent at — but stomaching the same 
sandwich thrice weekly while regular-
ly churning out halfway decent papers 
at the 11th hour? That, thank you very 
much, I’m more than capable of. 

I, like everyone else, now have 
another quarter’s worth of distracting 
schoolwork to be grateful for, lest I 
worry about a post-grad world that 
won’t let me charge everything to 
my student account. One thing both 
my dad and the survey are quick to 
remind me, though, is that if I play 
to my strengths, I just might shock 
myself by turning out okay.

Vice President Joe Biden’s recent unfiltered dialogue at the health-
care signing ceremony is nothing 
short of humiliating. Sure, this reform 
is indeed a “big fucking deal,” but as 
a leader of our nation, he could have 
chosen more euphemistic language to 
convey that message. 

Even though his words were 
intended for President Barack 
Obama’s ears only, it’s unsettling for 
the involuntary eavesdroppers (aka, all 
of America) to realize that one of the 
government’s top dogs is loosened up 
enough to behave like a Jerry Springer 
contestant. If our nation’s second-in-
command can’t come up with a 
response that wouldn’t make 
half the nation cringe, maybe 
he should have chosen to 
remain tight-lipped in such 
a professional setting.

It’s true that even the 
most eloquent speakers 
are still humans capable 
of dropping an F-bomb 
here or there, but at the 
same time, there’s a time 
and place for elevated, 
eloquent language 
and a time and place 
for uncensored locker-
room talk — and the public 
visibility of rooms in the 
White House should never 
start to feel like the latter. 
So for the sake of our nation and all 
who look up to government officials 
as emblems of professionalism, Biden 
should give his mouth the old soap-
and-water scrub-down. Maybe next 
time he’ll remember what shouldn’t 
come out — making everyone a little 
more proud to be an American. 

— Kelsey Marrujo
Senior Staff Writer

We can all agree that it was a bad judgment call for Biden to 
curse into Obama’s ear last Tuesday. 
But in front of a generation so desen-
sitized to overt sexuality and profan-
ity in the media, dropping a private 
F-bomb on air just isn’t a very big 
fucking deal.

Biden wasn’t exaggerating. Passing 
a health-insurance overhaul in a 
country where 45 million people don’t 
even have basic coverage is indeed a 
huge deal.

He didn’t say anything very offen-
sive, either. At one time or another, 

everyone’s dropped a good ol’ 
four-letter word — just not 

on national television.
Biden’s slip-up is 

less a cause for inter-
national concern 
than evidence that 
he’s only human — 
and therefore just 

as likely as anyone to 
take his enthusiasm a 

little too far in times of 
extreme awesomeness. 

As a response, the 
infamous 17-year-
old McKay Hatch, 

founder of his high 
school’s “No Cussing Club,” 
is demanding an apology 

from his vice president and 
sent him a “No Cussing” care 

package — including a jar for Biden to 
place a coin in every time he swears. 
While all that’s well and good for 
Hatchy and his crew of do-gooders, 
the overblown media coverage of 
Biden’s mistake takes the focus — once 
again — off this historic news to shine 
a spotlight on the trivial.

centers, his proposal claimed it could 
save the state approximately $12 bil-
lion over the next decade. But UC 
Board of Regents Chairman Russell S. 
Gould is hesitant about jumping into 
bed with the prison system: “We are 
going to have to spend a great deal of 
time to determine how and if the uni-
versity is going to get involved.” 

He’s right to have cold feet. Joining 
hands with the California prison sys-
tem will only do harm to the univer-
sity. Even though Texas’s joint univer-
sity-prison health-care system boasts 
one of the lowest costs for prison 
health care nationally, the University 
of Texas and Texas Tech University 
lost $122.1 million to prison health 
care from 2006 to 2007. Last time we 
checked (and saw our student fees 
rise 32 percent), the UC system didn’t 
have an extra $122.1 million laying 
around.

Aside from absorbing the costs of 
33 state prisons’ health-care needs, 
the UC system will also pick up the 
tab for the countless lawsuits filed 
by dissatisfied inmates, according to 
Andrew Kahn — an attorney rep-
resenting the Union of American 
Physicians and Dentists. 

According to California Citizens 
Against Lawsuit Abuse, a statewide 
grassroots movement, on average, 
state prisoners file more than two 
lawsuits every business day — an 
expense of over $191 million between 
2002 and 2008. It doesn’t take an 
economics degree to realize that now 
is not the time for the UC system to 
be taking on any additional respon-

sibilities. 
Stobo claims that “a portion of [the 

state’s] savings could be used for high-
er education in California” and unless 
the simple majority thing passes, 
that’s not likely. At this point, the UC 
can’t afford to gamble with “coulds” 
and “maybes.” If we are going to see 
this plan through, the UC system will 
need to see legislative affirmation that 
some of those “savings” will go to us. 

While California’s prison system 
costs $2.4 bil-
lion per year 
— exponen-
tially more 
than other 
states  — 
turning any 
duties over 
to an endan-
gered public 
education 
system and a 
gamble like 
NuPhysicia is 

a lose-lose situation. 
It’s important to remember that 

even if UC system does decide to 
work with NuPhysicia, the prison 
system would still be under federal 
receivership, and the receiver is the 
one who racked up California’s 
prisoner health-care bill in the first 
place. NuPhysicia even noted that the 
plan would only be effective if the 
courts amend the demands of Plata 
v. Schwarzenegger to permit virtual 
health care. Before tasking the UC 
system with additional responsibili-
ties, Schwarzenegger first needs to 
either work with the federal receiver 

or work with the courts to relieve the 
receiver of his duties. While there is 
a mandated receivership, the federal 
government will continue to make 
decisions that should be left up to 
the state — therefore  continuing to 
increase the cost of prisoner health 
care.

Second, increase the efficiency of 
the outdated pharmaceutical system 
to save money. According to U.S. 
Inspector General David R. Shaw, the 
current prescription tracking system 
employed by state prisons is so inef-
ficient that inmates’ prescriptions are 
sometimes still filled for the eight 
months after they’ve been discharged, 
pushing expenditures by $3.6 billion 
past the budget. Although updating 
the current system won’t be an end-
all solution to the prison health-care 
crisis, a snip here and a trim there will 
bring us one step closer to resolving 
our problem.

Health-care employees could also 
be given a cap for the onetime hours. 
It’s not uncommon for employees to 
log 12- to 18-hour shifts a day. While 
the additional time is great for under-
paid state employees, it’s dangerous 
for health-care workers to be manning 
shifts for so long, not to mention, and 
costs the state an additional $60 mil-
lion a year.

Seeing prison health care, the UC 
system and NuPhysicia together on 
a Macbook screen is definitely one 
virtual house call we don’t want the 
doctor to be making.

focus on banning both hate speech — 
such as [student newspaper] the Koala 
— and hate acts such as the hateful 
historical use of objects, like hanging a 
noose,” Sanchez said.

Sanchez has been working with 
A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West and BSU co-
chairs David Ritcherson and Fnann 
Keflezighi to draft the legislation lan-
guage. 

“We looked at the existing law 
and began writing the essential com-
ponents in a way that we hope won’t 
mess with the First Amendment,” 
Sanchez said.

According to West, the legislation 
would ensure hate speech or terroriz-
ing acts not be protected by the First 
Amendment, and be instead punish-
able under state law. 

San Diego American Civil 
Liberties Union David Blair-Loy said 
such a bill would be unconstitution-
al unless it dealt with true threats, 
or threats that a reasonable person 
would interpret as meant to inflict 
harm. 

For example, California Law AB 
412 classifies hanging a noose in a 
public area as a misdemeanor punish-
able up to a year in jail and a $5,000 
fine

However, Blair-Loy said hate 
speech is not a true threat, and is pro-
tected by the First Amendment. 

“Racial slurs and epithets and hate 
speech don’t qualify as true threats,” 
he said. “It’s offensive, it’s degrading, 
but it is unconstitutional to make it 
illegal.”

He added that the university can-
not define which speech is protected. 

“Every time the university estab-
lishes speech codes to try to end hate 
speech, it’s always been struck down 
by the courts,” he said. 

Alec Weisman, editor in chief of 
the student Republican newspaper 
the California Review said that such 
legislation would create a slippery 

slope for the definition of hate speech.
“One person’s hate speech is 

another person’s freedom of speech,” 
Weisman said. “I don’t want to see 
someone’s morals being used to 
define what is and what isn’t hate 
speech. If they want to speak against 
hate speech, they should, instead of 
shutting everyone down.”

Sanchez said he is confident 
the bill would not violate the First 
Amendment, and said he disagrees 
that it would create a slippery slope.

West, Sanchez, Keflezighi and 
Ritcherson met with UC President 
Mark G. Yudof and the UC Board 
of Regents for preliminary discus-
sion of the legislation following the 
UC Commission on the Future meet-
ing, which was held from March 23 
to March 25 at UC San Francisco 
Mission Bay. 

West said Yudof and the regents 
were supportive of the legislation, but 
stressed that the language needed to 
be revised to prevent it from breach-
ing the First Amendment.

“We’ve been told that the way it’s 
worded now, it’s not going to pass, 
and the way we worded it, it can’t 
be pushed through,” she said. “We’re 
working on editing and strengthening 
the legislation.”

Sanchez said he is hopeful the 
regents will pass the legislation on 
a statewide level — which would 
impact the University of California, 
California State Universities and the 
California Community College sys-
tems. 

“The regents are finally beginning 
to feel the heat to act on this,” he said. 
“We’re applying pressure, and we’re 
hopeful that it’ll go through.”

Sanchez said he wants to have a 
finalized draft ready in time for the 
next regents meeting in May, so the 
bill could go to vote in the state legis-
lature shortly thereafter.

West said she plans to arrange a 
conference call with Sanchez, the BSU 
leaders and UCOP Vice President and 

General Counsel for Legal Affairs 
Chris Robinson to strengthen the 
bill’s language. She said that if the 
legislation is passed in California, she 
will push for it to be implemented 

nationwide. 
During the 

Commission on the 
Future meeting — 
attended by West and 
members of the BSU 
— the regents were also 

scheduled to discuss Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s proposal that the 
university manage prison health care 
with a company called NuPhysicia. 
However, the regents cancelled the 
briefing and instead created a com-
mittee to research the matter further. 

“The committee hasn’t even been 
created yet,” UC spokesman Peter 
King said. “We’re acting as the inter-
mediaries, and there’s a lot of differ-
ent players and different things that 
need to be worked through.”

Sue Wilson, a spokeswoman for 
the Union of American Physicians 
and Dentists, said the system would 
create conflicts of interest. 

According to Wilson, senior vice 
president for health sciences John 
Stobo — a supporter of the prison 
health care idea — was affiliated with 
NuPhysicia in his previous post as 
president of the University of Texas 
medical branch, and could stand to 
gain if the system adopted the prison 
health-care proposal.

However, King said these allega-
tions were unfounded. 

“These are terribly phony con-
cerns,” said King. “It’s union reps 
making ill-advised innuendo about 
Dr. John Stobo, who has no financial 
stake and connection to the business 
now.”

King said  the regents will revisit 
all options at their next meeting from 
May 18 to May 20 at UCSF.

the time it took to obtain their 
professional degrees. For example, 
fees for the Berkeley and UCLA 
law schools were increased by 
$5,000 from the 2003-04 academic 
year to 2004-05. 

“The total damages are the 
overpayment of fees that all the 
student class members paid,” 
Leonard said. “If you add up what 
each student paid in what the court 
deemed unlawful 
increases, that adds up 
to the total amount for 
the entire class.” 

UC attorney 
Christopher Patti said 
the university plans 
to appeal the ruling. 
He said  he believes 
the online materials 
did not constitute a 
contract. 

“It’s our belief that 
the university never 
made any promise to 
the students in this 
group of plaintiffs 
that their fees would 
be held constant 
during their period of 
enrollment,” Patti said.

Patti said the 
university did not raise fees 
illegally.

“There is an annual fee guide 
that sets out what the fees are 
for each academic year, and the 
fee guide that applied to the year 
these students enrolled never 
had the language about the fee 
being maintained constant,” Patti 
said. “We think that there was no 
representation to these students 
that that would be the case.”

According to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, on Aug. 25, 2003, the 
university deleted a statement that 

promised no fee increases would 
occur. 

In his ruling, Munter followed 
a precedent set by the 2007 
case Kashmiri v. Regents of the 
University of California. That case 
was won by students who claimed 
the university had breached a 
similar contract by raising its fees. 

Following the Kashmiri ruling, 
the university failed to revise 
the contract's wording for new 

students.
“Students [in both 

cases] were concerned 
that the fee increases 
violated their rights,” 
Leonard said.

After the Kasmiri 
case, the UC system 
was required to pay $42 
million to students who 
had enrolled in profes-
sional degree programs 
in 2002. 

To pay off this 
expense, the university 
has been charging stu-
dents in these programs 
a fee of $60 per year, 
and may have to instate 
another fee depending 
on the March 10 appeal 
ruling, Patti said. 

Despite the precedent, Patti is 
confident the university will be 
able to reverse the ruling.

“There won't be any refunds 
that go out until the appeal has 
been decided and only if we do not 
prevail in the appeal,”  Patti said. 

UC professional degree 
students, both resident and 
nonresident, often pay over 
$40,000 a year in fees, depending 
on their program.

W ith the economy still in a slump and not looking up, many students — worried their UCSD diploma may 
not be the prestigious piece of parch-
ment it was cracked up to be — are 
pursuing an academic internship to iron 
neatly onto their resume.

As the job market becomes increas-
ingly competitive, being a GPA superstar 
isn’t enough to edge out the other can-
didates. Landing an internship while in 
college can be just as clutch as keeping 
up the Provost’s Honors we’ve guarded 
since freshman year.

Here at UCSD, the Academic 
Internship Program is seeing a spike 
in participants. During the 2008-09 
academic year, the AIP enrolled just 
over 550 students; however, program 
officials estimate that the numbers for 
the 2009-10 academic year will reach 
well over 600. And according to the 2006 
Graduating Student Survey, 44 percent of 
students who were involved in academic 
or co-curricular activities while attend-
ing UCSD participated in an internship, 
compared to 23 percent who participated 
in study-abroad programs or the 25 per-
cent who enrolled in honors or advanced 
courses. 

Of course, not every internship 
guarantees a stellar experience and 
post-graduate employment — they can 
also be a keen strategy for companies 
to extract cheap labor from wide-eyed, 
Xerox-savvy undergrads. 

The AIP was established in 1976 to 
give students an opportunity to bridge 
the gap between their studies and pro-
fessional career goals. Unlike intern-
ships discovered through independent 
research, academic internships also 
allow students to earn credit toward 
upper-division general electives with a 
‘Pass’/‘No Pass’ grade. And since many 
participating companies require that 
their unpaid interns receive verifi-
able credit that students must pay for 
to receive, enrollment in the AIP isn’t 
always optional.

According to AIP Assistant Director 
and Internship Counselor Tricia Taylor-
Oliveira, the AIP’s staff is available to 
provide referrals and advice during the 

SUIT ING UP

As the competition stiffens,
job seekers are using academic 

internships more than ever to gain 
work experience and rub some 
credibility into their resumes.

INFOCUS DE-STRESS FEST: THERAPY FLUFFIES

I t’s a well-established, indestructible law of nature that adorable things are the perfect panacea for finals. And every year at UCSD man’s best friend never fails to 
make an appearance when you least expect it — walking 
back from Center Hall, drugged up, pen down and brain 
drained of all comprehension.

As part of the De-Stress Fest — the University 
Centers’ annual week-long giveaway — PC Ballroom was 
transformed into a geriatrics ward on Tuesday, March 16 
from 10 a.m.  — 2 p.m., speckled with Irish Setters, Cocker 
Spaniels, Pomeranians and Dachshunds. All in the name 
of surviving the week-long tumult of scantrons, free 
responses, essays and short answers. 

Also included in the week’s festivities was “Massage 
Mania” (Monday), “Cupcakes and Cocoa”  (Tuesday), 
“Bagels and Bluebooks” (Wednesday) and “Kiss Winter 
Quarter Goodbye”  (Thursday) – at which students 
handed out Hershey’s kisses and tubes of chapstick as a 
final send off.

Needless to say, the string of de-stressers provided 
enough distraction to get students through one 
Tuesday’s worth of tests and a hearty lack of sleep.

CALI PARTY BUS

SITESEEN I t’s not hard to know a party bus when you spot one. Chances are, it’s tinted, oversized and emanating some shade 
of indigo. And while all the blacklighting 
and neon sparks can be a bit much for 
non-seasoned riders, chances are, you’re 
not enjoying yourself enough if you’re 
taking note of them, and not because the 
ambiance around you is lacking. 

As the party-bus and limo provider 
that’s been badged “Best in San Diego” by 
10News for a couple years now, Cali Party 
Bus lives up to its name.

Cushy, wrap-around limo seating and 
wooden floors are the basics. Add LCD 
screens, glow-in-the-dark upholstery, laser 
lights and a glass ceiling starred with tiny, 
changing Lite Brite pegs and you feel as 
though you’ve stepped inside a multicol-
ored screensaver. Spacey headroom and 
ample aisle room are more than you need 
to get up and dance for the entire ride. 
But if that’s not your cup of tea, you could 
always steal the show on the crystal-clear 
stripper pole that studs the middle of the 
bus like a glorious centerpiece. Selfish slut. 

But with busses wagoning anywhere 
from 15 to 45 passengers, your amenities 
depend on the kind of ride you choose. 
Sadly, the “dance” poles only come with 
the 45-passenger models. 

However, no matter their size, every 
beast in the Cali Party Bus fleet comes 
decked with some extra cup holders or 
a wet bar to chill whatever bottles you 
bring inside. Musical comforts include an 
iPod connect, if you’ve planned that far 
in advance — an FM radio, if you can’t 
even remember what you were doing two 
minutes ago. 

If you want to go big with a trip to 
Vegas there’s a service for that, and if 
you want to go wine tasting, Cali’s got 
you covered. But remember, to step out 

of a party bus 
at a vineyard 
without feeling 
embarrassed, 

you’re going to have to down a few 
beforehand.

 If you’re not feeling creative, the com-
pany offers plenty of ideas online such 
as wine tours to Callaway and Leonese 
Cellars or nightclubs like the Ivy and 
Stingaree as well as discounted rates for 
tailgate parties and Homecoming.

application process — helping students edit 
cover letters and resumes, discussing their 
career goals and even aiding in the selection 
process.

According to Taylor-Oliveira, the AIP office 
is not only a great resource for landing a job, but 
also expanding students’ awareness and knowl-
edge about any field they may plan on going into.

“I tell students to think actively and seek out 
every opportunity to get more out of the experi-
ence,” Taylor-Oliveira said. “You know if it’s a 
good time to talk, they might really sit down and 
chat with you about how they got there and what 
steps they needed to take.”

She said the intern’s experience is always valu-
able — even if it doesn’t guarantee you a job. 

“If the internship doesn’t lead to a job, you 
network and meet people, get contacts of people 
who can be useful to connect to other opportuni-
ties,” Taylor-Oliveira said. 

2009 Revelle College alumnus Craig Hill cur-
rently works at Doan Law Firm as a legal assis-
tant, where he first began as an academic intern. 
With the help of the AIP internship database, 
Hill said he was able to apply to a law firm that 
fit his learning expectations based on the com-
ments that previous interns had left in the AIP’s 
database. 

“While I could have applied on my own, I 
wouldn’t have known what to look for,” Hill said. 
“Just the fact that they gave me contacts to call 
and [told me] what to have prepared streamlined 
the whole process for me.”

Though some students have expressed com-
plaints about the expenses and workload required 
to earn academic credit through AIP, Hill 
remains a proponent of the program. 

“As an out-of-state student, I paid $40,000 to 
go school, and it is really nice to know that my 
tuition paid for programs like AIP that give you 
opportunities like this,” Hill said. “Having these 
resources are great, because you can’t find things 
like this once you are out of college.”

At Doan Law Firm, Hill learned about con-
sumer litigation by working alongside lawyers 
— assisting them in analyzing legal material, con-
ducting research and talking to clients. 

“I was actually in the field, and you kind of 
just have to go with the flow,” Hill said. “You pick 
up jargon and learn to apply the concepts you 
just read in books.”

Needless to say, Hill was a success story 
for the AIP. He said he was simply fortunate 
that Doan Law Firm was hiring legal assistants 
around the time his internship ended. 

For the majority of students, internships 
offer academic credit for the time they devote 
and their training. Some manage to score a paid 
internship, if they’re lucky. In many cases, stu-
dents devote 30 hours of work per week they’re 
not getting paid for, on top of jobs they may 
already have, as well as class work. While many 
students like Hill eagerly accept credits as pay, 
Warren College senior Dara Bu sees it as a loop-
hole for companies to extort free labor from a 
generation of potential employees struggling to 
secure an advantage in an evolving job market. 

Bu said it was a difficult decision to invest 
hefty hours into unpaid office work in lieu of an 
actual job. In addition, paying standard academic 
fees for the units seemed an unfair burden.

“At one point, I had two internships, both 
unpaid, while working a part-time job,” Bu said. 
“I knew it was a good experience, but it just 
sucked putting in so much time to something 
when I knew I could have been making money 
doing something else.”

Though some companies offer paid intern-
ships, others get away with hawking academic 
credit as long as their criteria meet the standards 
of the Fair Labor Standards Act. According to the 
U.S. Department of Labor, the FLSA states that 
students can be regarded as “trainees” as long as 
they meet criteria stipulating that both parties 
understand that the trainees are not entitled to 
wages for time spent in training. Students must 
work under close supervision, and the employer 
that provides the training must receive no imme-
diate advantage from the activities — the training 
must strictly benefit the student. 

To ensure that students are indeed apply-
ing for legitimate internships that meet UCSD’s 
specific educational standards, Taylor-Oliveira 
says that the AIP office acts as a kind of filter — 
screening out any potentially shady companies 
while maintaining a database for the ones that 
students have enjoyed.

However, Warren College senior Lisa Tat said 
she found it to be a disadvantage that students are 
forced to work a minimum number of hours in 
order to meet the academic-credit requirements,

late. Planned Parenthood now offers free or

significantly reduce their risk of getting 

HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer.

as opposed to adapting to a more natural work-
place schedule.

During Winter Quarter, Tat interned for San 
Diego County Speech Pathology as an office 
assistant and “Reading Stars” tutor. She taught 
preschool and kindergarten students about pho-
netics for roughly 65 minutes twice a week, and 
— for the remaining hours — made cutouts, 
pamphlets and games for the children’s activities.

“I struggled to find work to do after teach-
ing the children how to read,” Tat said. “Because 
the point of an internship is to gain experience 
and learn as much as you can in the field, there 
is no point of filling up the hours just to do so.”

The program requires at least 10 hours a 
week of labor, a 10-page research paper, an 
exit evaluation and three online workshops — 
which equate to a four-unit course. Tat said she 
felt she was putting in more hours than neces-
sary for an ideal experience. 

“It should be up to the discretion of the 
supervisor at the internship site to assign the 
kind of work and determine how many hours 
you work,” said Tat. 

According to Taylor-Oliveira, the AIP may 
not be a perfect fit for students who already 
have too much on their plate. 

“It’s a serious academic endeavor that 
shouldn’t be taken lightly,” Taylor-Oliveira said. 
“But for those who do commit, an academic 
internship helps [them] see the practical side of 
what they are studying in classrooms.”

As a double major in communications and 
international history, Bu said her first internship 
experience at MTV Tres — the popular music 
channel’s Latin-American sibling — did help her 
narrow her career scope. Despite the stress of 
having to intern while holding down a job and 
taking four classes, Bu said the academic intern-
ship helped put her studies into perspective.

“Even though I studied the history of Latin 
America, I realized I sucked at actually speak-
ing Spanish, and was not even that in-tune with 
the culture,” Bu said. “I also didn’t like how 
everything had to appeal to a streamlined audi-
ence.”

Following her internship at MTV Tres, 
Bu scored a higher-level internship at Elle 
Communications, where she explored fashion 
and design by selecting outfits for display man-
nequins and traveling to fashion shows in New 

York. She says that it was likely because of her 
experience at MTV Tres that she got the intern-
ship with Elle.

“I realized how much I loved working in this 
field, dealing with clients and doing things like 
designing window sets,” Bu said. “PR and mar-
keting is much more interactive and fun for me.” 

Experts at the Economic Policy Institute 
have even proposed legislation that would force 
the federal government to appropriate $500 
million annually to support up to 100,000 low-
income college students’ internships. According 
to co-author of the legislation Alexander Hertel-
Hernandez, most low-income college students 
are not full-time, so they can’t receive financial 
aid for the cost of an unpaid internship which 
includes transportation, food and temporary 
housing. By subsidizing unpaid internships for 
lower-income students, Hertel-Hernandez said, 
the federal government would be opening up 
opportunities for a more diverse array of stu-
dents to participate in internships that are usual-
ly given to middle- and upper-income students.

Incidentally, Hertel-Hernandez got his job 
at the Economic Policy Institute after interning 
there during his senior year of college.

According to the Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction Survey conducted 
by UCSD’s Office of Student Research and 
Information, students who engage in creative, 
non-classroom activities are considerably more 
satisfied with their overall college experience 
than those students who do not pursue experi-
ences that take the them beyond the lecture hall, 
lab and library experience. 

Accordingly, former Doan Law Firm intern 
Hill advocated the AIP wholeheartedly, and rec-
ommended that students get an internship while 
in school. Even if it means having to shoulder 
a little more than they’re used to, he said, it will 
make their prospects after graduation that much 
brighter. 

“Some people spend all that money for 
graduate school when they are unsure it is what 
they want to get into, and plenty of them are 
still unemployed,” Hill said. “Do an internship 
— take advantage of the fact that you are there 
to learn and can [do it] at your own pace. The 
experience is invaluable.”

to pull in front. The team did take 
a 12-point lead midway through the 
second half — after an 11-0 run dur-
ing which sophomore guard Chelsea 
Carlisle scored seven points — but 
the Lumberjacks soon countered 
with dominant post play.

Taylor scored 21 of her points in 
the second half, and the Lumberjacks 
finally regained the lead with just 
2:32 remaining.

When Taylor hit a three on 
Humboldt’s next possession, she 
secured their lead for the rest of the 
game.

The Tritons sank only two of 
seven shots in the final two minutes, 
allowing the Lumberjacks to hold 
strong to their lead to seal the win. 

While Humboldt stole the show 
with its accurate shooting, the 
Tritons only shot 34 percent during 
the game.

They were hurt by a lackluster 
night from the CCAA MVP Carlisle, 
shooting just 6-24 and 2-12 from 

beyond the arc.
Carlisle ended with 16 points and 

five assists, but shot only .25 percent 
from the field — well below her sea-
son average of .42 — while senior for-
ward Erin Noonan scored 10 points 
in her final game for UCSD.

Senior guard Annette Ilg tallied 
25 points and 8 rebounds, while 
junior forward Tiffany Hunter added 
seven points and 12 rebounds.

Humboldt moved on to play 
Chico State — a team they hammered 
only days before to win the CCAA 
tournament.

However, Chico State was up to 
the task and chalked an 86-76 victory.

Despite this year’s astounding 
start, the Tritons were knocked out 
in the first round of the NCAA tour-
nament for the first time since the 
2005-06 season.

They finished the season with an 
overall record of 25-5.

two days were not standout days.  But we all got 
together and finished outstandingly.”

The competition began on the morning of 
Wednesday, Mar. 10 with a gambit of prelimi-
nary races to determine racing seeds.

Cunningham said UCSD struggled through 
the first few days of the competition — and their 
seedings heading into the races reflected their 
troubles.

“It was pretty tough competition,” 
Cunningham said. “We were down the first two 
days, so we had to swim a lot harder in the next 
two days to place higher.”

On the women’s side, sophomore Alex Henley 
set a UCSD record in the 200-yard backstroke, 
posting a time of 1:58.79 for a second-place fin-
ish. She also posted a record time of 2:00.30 to 
win the 200-yard butterfly, then recorded the 
national championship winning time in the 400-
yard individual medley: 4:18.71.

Henley also took second place in the 200-
yard individual medley with a time of 2:02.04, 
just short of her personal best. 

On the men’s side, senior Daniel Perdew con-
tinued to elbow out the nation’s best D-II swim-
mers, winning the 50-yard freestyle for the third 
time as a Triton. He finished the finals heat with 
a time of 20.07 — barely edging out the second-
place finisher by .03 seconds.

On the last day of the tournament — and 
Perdew’s last night as a collegiate swimmer — 
he finished with a glistening performance in the 
100 freestyle, turning a time of 44.10 seconds. 
Perdew sealed his place among tournament 
greats by winning his fifth overall career NCAA 
championship.

“It’s gratifying to see them swim,” McGihon 
said. “It’s a great example of what happens when 
you put so much work and effort into train-
ing, and what you can get back from that much 
work.”

Henley and Perdew were not the only Triton  
winners. The meet ended with an inspired 
performance from the 400-yard freestyle relay 
teams on both the men’s and women’s sides.

The men’s team — Perdew, sophomore Sam 
Stromberg, sophomore Blake Langland and 
senior Todd Langland — capped off the meet 

with a second-place finish in the last race, fall-
ing behind first-place Wingate University by .22 
seconds.

The women then saw their 400-yard freestyle 
team — Henley, freshman Amber Tan, junior 
Anju Shimura and junior Jessica Ferguson — 
score just enough points to edge out West 
Chester for third place overall at the meet.

“It was exciting, but [we were] also anxious,” 
Cunningham said. “It was a really close race, and 
it really came down to the last lap. We were just 
trying to get our swimmers pumped up to swim 
and do their best.”

My predictions
Division champ: Colorado Rockies
In the hunt: San Francisco Giants
Fantasy sleeper: Carlos González, Colorado 
rightfielder
Story to follow: If/when the Padres trade 
first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.

2) National League Central
Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday in the 

same lineup for a whole season is a danger-
ous combination that makes the St. Louis 
Cardinals the odds-on favorites to win the 
Central. Surrounding the dynamic duo is a 
young offense headed by an emerging Ryan 
Ludwick and Brendan “I Have the Grossest 
Mustache on the Planet” Ryan. They’ll pro-
vide Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright 
with more than enough runs to top the table 
in the division all year. As the Chicago Cubs 
enter the 237th year of their World Series 
draught, the only serious competition the 
Cardinals will face all year will be from the 
Milwaukee Brewers. 

The Brew Crew boast Prince Fielder and 
Ryan Braun as a middle-of-the-order threat 
to match Pujols and Holliday, but even if 
they’ve got Randy Wolf from the Dodgers 
to help their pitching staff, the Brewers will 
struggle to keep pace in the six-team divi-
sion.

The Cincinnati Reds are still a few years 
away from making a legitimate run at the 
top, and we can expect plenty more banality 
from the Pirates and Astros.
My predictions 
Division champ: St. Louis Cardinals
In the hunt: Milwaukee Brewers
Fantasy sleeper: Wandy Rodríguez, Houston 
Astros starting pitcher
Story to follow: Will the Pirates have their 
18th straight losing season?

National League East 
After riding Cliff Lee’s coattails all the 

way to a second straight World Series 

appearance, the Philadelphia Phillies 
thanked their left-handed ace by shipping 
him off to the Seattle Mariners. Why on 
Earth would the Phil’s front office do such 
a thing? To make room for one of the few 
pitchers alive who might actually be bet-
ter than Lee: Roy Halladay, of course. The 
health and sustainability of lefty starter 
Cole Hamels and closer Brad Lidge are the 
Phillies’ only question marks.

Even after throwing a New York-sized 
fist of cash at free-agent outfielder Jason 
Bay, the Mets will still find a way to choke 
with their A-List roster, so let’s not even 
worry about them. 

And aside from the eventual promotion 
of rookie flame-thrower and San Diego 
State alum Stephen Strausburg from their 
AA affiliate this summer, the Washington 
Nationals will continue to be, well, the 
Washington Nationals.

That leaves the Atlanta Braves and the 
Florida Marlins as two young, intriguing 
teams in the bubble that just might have 
enough to make things interesting in the 
East. Rookie rightfielder Jason Heyward 
and new closer Billy Wagner will help keep 
manager Bobby Cox’s face flushed red with 
excitement throughout his final season in 
Atlanta. 
My predictions
Division champ: Philadelphia Phillies
In the hunt: Atlanta Braves
Fantasy sleeper: Chris Coghlan, Florida 
Marlins Outfielder
Story to follow: The battle for Rookie of the 
Year between Heyward and Strausbourg.

So there you have them: my foolproof 
picks for the upcoming 2010 MLB season. 
Go ahead, take your part-time coffee shop 
earnings to Vegas this weekend and bet it 
all on my predictions. And feel free to come 
talk to the Guardian if they don’t end up 
panning out.

Thursday with the Beerleague Softball

League).

HOTCORNERTHIS DAY IN HISTORY
In 1982, the University of North Carolina 
defeated Georgetown University 63-62 
in the 44th NCAA Men’s National 
Championship Basketball game. In the 
game, Michael Jordan hit the game    
winning shot with 15 seconds left.

The senior recorded a new record for UCSD in the men’s 
800-meter race on Saturday, Mar. 27 at the Cal/Nevada 
Championships. Anderson’s time of 1:51.12 topped the 
previous school best of 1:51.26, set in 1993.

DANIEL ANDERSON | TRACK

SWIMMING & DIVING — The UCSD men and women 
finished their seasons with a splash, competing admirably 
against top teams from across the nation at the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association championship meets from 
Mar. 10 through Mar. 13. The women claimed a third-place 
finish, while the men finished seventh in the final team 
standings.

The swimmers arrived in Canton, Ohio with little indi-
cation of how they’d fare in the most difficult field of com-
petition all season — and, of course the imposing set of final 
exams that awaited them after the tournament.

In preparation, the team dedicated the entirety of week 
10 to tackling potential challenges at the NCCA tourna-
ment. However, many members could not help but be dis-

tracted by their schoolwork.
“We knew we would miss a whole week, so we had a 

couple of days where we had to practice in the morning 
and then study when we got back to the hotel,” said senior 
captain Cari Cunningham. “When we were flying back, we 
were all studying pretty hard.”

Amid the added pressure of academic obligations, head 
coach Scott McGihon said he was proud of the swimmers’ 
strong season finish, though they had the potential to finish 
higher.

“We were somewhat happy with the results,” McGihon 
said. “We felt like we should have done better — the first 

The Opening Day of the 2010 Major League Baseball season is finally here. This Sunday signals 
the start of the most glorious, nerve-
wracking and exhausting six months of 
the year.

To help you prepare for the beautiful 
162-game streak of men in tights just 
around the corner, here are my annual 
preseason predictions for each division, 
with some accessory categories for the 
hell of it. 
1) National League West

With all apologies to local San 
Diegans, this is anybody’s division. 
Arguably the toughest group from 

which to choose a winner this season, 
the NL West is packing four differ-
ent teams that could easily take first 
place — even if they don’t necessarily 
have what it takes to make a run at 
the World Series this year. Last year’s 
champs — the LA Dodgers — had 
a flop of an offseason: Team owners  
Frank and Jamie McCourt got divorced, 
overshadowing a starting rotation 
deficiency evidenced by the fact that 
Vicente Padilla is their Opening Day 
starter.

Coming off a successful 2009 Wild 
Card run, the Colorado Rockies are 
a young, fast and defensively sound 
team that could run away with the divi-
sion if ace starting pitcher Jeff Francis 
rebounds well after missing all of last 
year due to Tommy John surgery.

The San Francisco Giants have 
the best pitching staff in the National 
League — and maybe even the majors 
— but will have to eek out enough 
offense from newly added hitters 
Aubrey Huff and Mark DeRosa. Still, 
with a rotation anchored by Tim 
Lincecum and Matt Cain — whose 
fourth starter threw a no-hitter last year 
— you can bet on the Giants to take the 
NL Wild Card.

Even the Arizona Diamondbacks 
have the firepower and youth to stay 
competitive. With a rotation anchored 
by Dan Haren and the unworldly ath-

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — At the NCAA 
Division-II Tournament on March 12, the 
Tritons were given another shot at redemp-
tion against age-old rivals Humboldt State 
— only to leave the tournament early in 
frustrated defeat.

No. 2 UCSD faced No. 7 Humboldt for 
a third straight week, quickly eliminated 
from the tournament after a tough 76-72 
opening-round loss.

Senior guard Annette Ilg scored 25 
points and eight rebounds in her outstand-
ing final game as a Triton, but it was not 
enough to overcome another night of on-

fire shooting from Humboldt.
In the end, Humboldt pulled off the 

upset win, carried by senior center Britteny 
Taylor’s 27 points and nine rebounds, along 
with a whopping total of 10 three-pointers.

Humboldt had knocked UCSD out of the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association 
tournament a week earlier, hitting eight 
second-half three-pointers to earn a 82-78 
semifinal victory on March 5. 

“We’re obviously very disappointed that 
we didn’t get it done and that our season’s 
over,” head coach Charity Elliott said. “We 
were playing very well early in the second 
half, but Humboldt just made the plays they 
needed to get back in it, and we didn’t do a 
very good job of responding.” 

The Tritons and the Lumberjacks have 
written a contentious history this sea-
son: Humboldt accounted for three of the 
Triton’s mere five season losses.

After a record-breaking 14-0 start to 
the Triton season, the Lumberjacks handed 
UCSD its first loss with an 84-80 game on 

Jan. 21 in Arcata.
When it was the Tritons’ turn to host, 

they demolished the Lumberjacks on Feb. 
26, winning an 86-51 game that was never 
even close.

However, the Lumberjacks somehow 
rebounded from that loss to knock the 
Tritons out of two different post-season 
tournaments twice in one week.

“This is the biggest win of the season 
and a tremendous victory for our pro-
gram,” Humboldt coach Joddie Gleason 
said. “Knocking off a ranked team like 
UCSD is huge.”

As the best team for three-pointers in 
the conference, Humboldt accuracy from 
beyond the arc posed problems for the 
Tritons.

The teams traded buckets throughout 
the first half, and the Tritons went into half-
time with a 34-33 lead.

UCSD returned from halftime hoping 

Women place third, men finish seventh at nationals in Canton, Ohio, where
senior Dan Perdew and sophomore Alex Henley turn in record times.

The Tritons were knocked out 
of a postseason competition by 
rival Humboldt State for the 
second time in as many weeks.
