Opening up 
tIie !}{usfi !}{usfi Cafe 
By ANTIGONE GANAKIS. Contributing News Editor 

A FTER MORE THAN a year of planning and constructing by both the Crafts Center and the Associated Students, the new "AS Grove 
Caffe," located behind the Craft Center, will open as 
scheduled today. 

The outdoor cafe will serve a variety of coffees 
and teas, but as of yet, no plans have been made to 
add food to the menu. 

The cafe was originaUy_ the brainchild of both 
Brad Silen, AS. presidential advisor on special 
projects, and Ron Carlson, Crafts Center Director. 

"We both had the idea for a while and then Brad 

(Silen) approached me and we thought it was a 
great idea," said Carlson and added "I got the idea 
when I used to go up to the cafes in Berkeley. I 
wanted to create a place with a cenain ambience , 
culture ... someplace contemplative and centrally 
located," said Carlson. 

When Carlson began planning the addition to 
the Craft Center, in cahoots with the AS., his 
intentions were to create "a new service for 
students," not to broach the controversy that has 
nicknamed the coffeehouse the "Hush Hush Cafe."

UACIR members asked 
to boycott meetings 

All members of a committee 
set up to review University of 
California's $24 billion of 
holdings in companies that do

Two UCSD 
profs honored 
By DIANE RIGDON, Slaj] Wnta 

Two UCSD professors, Susan Kirkpatrick, associate professor of 
Spanish and comparative literature , and James Posakon)" assistant 
professor of biology, have recently received prestigious awards. 

Kirkpatrick has been awarded the John Simon Guggenheim 
fellowship and Posakony has been named a Pew Scholar in the 
biomedical sciences. 

The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation , based in 
New York, selects fellows to conduct research for one year in the 
areas of ans and humanities, civic and public affairs, education and 
sclen e. The grant distribullon is both national and international , 
the average grant being $18,921. The foundation gave a total 
$5 ,411,500 last year in fellowship monies, according to the 1986 
Taft Foundation Repon. 

Kirkpatrick, nominated by UCSD professor of Spanish literature 
and former Guggenheim winner, Jaime Concha, will receive a 
stipend, less than her present salary, which will pennit her 10 leave . 
her teaching position for one year to work on her research project, 
"Gender and Subjectivity in Spanish Romanticism." 

Kirkpatrick's work examines the role of women in Spanish 
literature during the 1830s-1840s romantic period in Spain. 

Kirkpatrick often investigates obscure writers and brings their 
works to light. She labels her work "exciting" and has written one 
book entirely in Spanish titled. Larra: EllaberinlO inextricable de un 
romantico liberal, (Larra : The inextricable labyrinlh of a liberal 
romantic)' 

Her second book deals with 19th century Realism in Spanish 
literature. 

According to Kirkpatrick, studying Span ish Iitenure has given 
the opponunity to have access to another culture and 10 critically 
view her own. 

James Posakony was nominated by UCSD's biology depanment 
for the 1986 Pew Scholars in the Biomedical Sciences, for his work 
on Drosophila (fruir flies). 

The Pew Memonal Trust of Philadelphia awards "future leaders 
in the scientific world" a total sum of $200,000 in annual stipends 
of $50,000 for four years. 

The program is administered at Yale University School of 
Medicine . 

Working with a drosopila gene which encodes an enzyme 
necessary to detoxify alcohols, Posakony hopes to prove a theory 
about the mechanisms by which a gene may be expressed only in 
specific tissues and at specific times. 

Posakony's $200,000 may be used only for his salary and fringe 
·benefits and for the purchase of materials. He plans to work in his 
UCSD laboratory with one technician as an assistant, hoping to 
pool his knowledge wi th other UCSD professors conducti ng , 
genetiC and molecular biology research . 

He selected the fruit fly as the integral pan of his research 
because it has a shorr life span , allowing hIm the opportunity to 
study many generations at one time. Additionally, its genes are the 
same as those found in higher organisms. 

Posakony began at UCSD in August of 1985. 
"Basic research has almost always led to greater undersrandingof 

the medical and scientific problems we face today," Posakony said .

Riley to assume office 
next Wednesday 
By JOHN SHAW, Staff Wnter 

John Riley's campaign 
promises will have a chance to 
become fulfilled when he 
assumes the office of AS 
president on May 21. 

This year, the Associated 
Students have a budget of 
$500,000. It is Riley's job to see 
that this sum is spent in the 
student body's best Interest. 

According to Riley, his first 
prioriry is to program a variety of 
student activities, including five 
T.G.s per quaner. He pointed out 
that the T.G.s don't necessarily 
have to be centered around 
alcohol. "If we can't get alcohol , 
then we 'll give away free pizza or 
something." 

Riley stated thar hiS prime 
concem IS for the student body 
have a good time. In an effon to 
do this, he plans to book big 
name bands, comedians and a 
diversity of speakers. Riley 
contends that funding isn't a 
major concern , It's merely a 
question of proper organization. 

A cnticism RlIey h\ls about the 
outgoing AS administration is its 
inability to "reach the average 
student ," due to lack of 
communication. Riley see this as 
the key to a successful AS. 
Through speeches and "pie-
charts" in the AS Bulletin, Riley 
intends to inform the student 
body of exactly how their fees 
are spent. 

Lack of suppOrt for UCSD 
athletics is another problem at 
UCSD that Riley plans to 
remedy. He hopes to proVide 
incentives for fans by 
collaborating with establishments 
like the Pub . Riley suggesred that 
the Triton Pub could offer a free 
drink for those who attend a 
game. 

Another gimmick he plans to 
employ is the use of a double-
decker bus to shuttle fans from 
the campus to the athletic games. 

On academic issues, Riley said 

he intends to broaden and 
strengthen the AS lecture note 
service. He plans to spend 
$3,000 to subsidize what he feels 
is the "most valuable" service 
offerd by the AS. The subsidies 
will allow for more course lecture 
nores to be offe red to classes 
with smaller enrollments. 

Riley also plans to check into 
an AS bookstore that might be 
open the first twO weeks of each 
quaner to offer textbooks such as 
Professor Shenk's, at cost. [ill

Cleaning out the AS Cafe 

The logistical mess that shrouds the construction and opening of the Grove Cafe is 
evidence of further violation of student trust by the AS Council. The construction of the 
cafe, although ostenSibly undenaken in an effort to serve student interests, has been 
handled in an indiscreet and irresponsible fashion. It remains entirely possible that as 
a result of this mishandling of $17,000 of student fees will be the cost of the 
loquaciousness of cenain members of the AS Council. 

In order to substantially reduce the cost of construction, an independent contractor 
was hired by the AS While the effort to reduce the cost of the cafe appears to be noble , 
its valiance was lessened by the inability of those "in-the-know" to diminish the 
chances of a university prohibition of the opening, 

The A.S. was willing to gamble that once the cafe was open, action to close it would 
prove so time-consuming and, perhaps, exp~nsive, that it would b~ disinclined to take 
action. The risk, taken with student funds, IS a great one. A declslOn to take such a 
gamble knOwing that alternative media, student organizations and co-ops are in dire 
need , must be made on the basis of careful evaluation and planning. 

The behavior of the A.S. councilmembers showed instead carelessness and 
disregard for the consequences of their actions and words. Information regarding the 
construction of the cafe , with all of its policy violation, was hardly kept in confidence; 
even the La Jolla Light was informed. The inabiliry of our A.S. to handle this situation in 
a cohesive and mature manner and its disregard for the enormiry of the stakes 
reenforces the fears we have held about AS administration all year long. 

Despite our concerns with our student leaders, we must give credit where it is due, 
For once the AS. Council has shown itself to be more than merely a pawn of the 
university administration. It has taken its own initiative to provide a student service 
which was not p'reviously sanctified by university regulations. . 

And , despite their gamble, the A.S. is lucky enough to work with a ex~ellent partner 
in its entrpreneurial endeavor. Ron Carlson has long demonstrated hls c~nce~ for 
sound projects and fair business. He has shown himself to be level-headed, mtelligent 
and discreet. And, above all , he takes the needs of the students and the university 
community as a whole to heart.

Militant comminnent 

Editor: 
The Guardian , in its opinions 

section (Inheriting anger, looking 
for peace, May J), has committed 
a grave injustice. It has 
condemned Arnie Schoenberg's 
militant action on the Revelle 
Pbza with tittle thought and with 
confused reasoning. It is violence 
that begets violence. If Arnie 
Schoenberg's act is considered 
violent, it is a statement against 
the violence of the state, That 
thousands are murdered, either 
di rectly or by proxy is immoral. 

When Arnie spilt paint on the 
ROTC table, his act was 
symbolic; he made a profound 
statement. His action highlighted 
the ideological bankruptcy of 
national policy, the slaughter of 
innocent people in the name of 
some 1ustice' that truly flows 
from exploitation, and his 
polttical discontent With the 
apathy and collusion of a 
University community that does 
nor pause to protest or question 
a flouri!.hing cancer in their 
midst. 

It IS easy for armchair 
mtellectuals to theorize in 
editorials or by their opimons; 
true commitment calls for a 
balanc.e between theory and 
practice. If rallies and Civil 
disobedience are forms of action 
that are acceptable to the 
Guardian , may one pause to ask 
how much or how little IS the 
populace' willing to sacnnce for 

JU3t and meaningful causes? If an 
indIVIdual takes a further step 
than others, IS that truly cause to 
he upse t? The Guardian 's 

concern for the sanctity of 
property is perplexing. It is 
concerned that the clothes of 
'several students' (incidentally, an 
untruth) were soiled by Arnie's 
action . Those who seek 
hegemony do not soil with 
poster paint, they smear blood 
with vengeance and intent. 

Arnie's action achieved a 
focus. There is a debate over the 
issue of military recruitmem on 
this campus. It IS a time when 
people can be educated and . 
mobilized in the struggle agamst 
militarization. apartheid , racism 
and intervention. His action 
forced people to evaluate their 
positions on these questions. His 
tactic was not a mass tactic, 
inasmuch as there was no 
collective reasoning or consensus 
before the act. Yet , historically. in 
movements there has always 
been room for Individual protest. 

We must never stifle positive 
individual creatlviry In the name 
of social good . Analytical 
reasoning has not been clouded 
but enhanced by the discussion 
over Arnie's ac tion and Intent. 
The Guardian is confused in ItS 
stance about separatism. It wantS 
to achieve the transformation to 
a JUst society with a singular, 
collective ideology. It seems that 
there IS no room for dissent or 
alternative action in the scheme 
that It proposes. It would do well 
to remember that it is a domi-
nant Ideology that we attack 
as perverse; let us not then 
substitute another dominant 
Ideology in ItS place. Let there be 
room for debate and diSCUSSion. 

Arnie Schoenberg did nm kill , 
wound, maim or otherwise 
traumauze anyone The Guardian 

should be responsible enough to 
accept and sta te that By 
deliberatley overstating the 
gravity of the physical act it has 
deplorably committed a grave 
injustice to the symbolic and 
defiant act of civil disobedience 
that was committed. 

All movements succeed with 
unity and a rerception of the 
common evi . Allow me to appeal 
to you to nm be misled, to not 
spilt hairs , to not be armchair 
activists,; there is limited time. A 
grave situation must be 
confronted . Civil disobedience is 
civil defense.

Eating up profit 
Editor: 

A problem I recognize to be 
serious her at UCSO, IS the meal-
card system. The way it is set up 
now, it does not cater to the 
problems many studems 
encounter. Common problems 
Include miSSing meals and not 
being able to make them up; 
being forced to eat (when not 
hungry) for the satisfaction of 
getting one's money"s worth ; and 
the limIted hours students can 
eat their three meals. In other 
words, the system IS not effiCient 
enough for the studems 

My ~olution to the 
Inconveniences of the system IS 
to establish a credit YSlem 
where all those who want to be 
on th . meal plan depOSit around 
$ 1000 into their food credit . 
Then each time they cat. they

ACT III: 

Three members of the SOSU crew team are killed and ten others 
injured when their van spins out on 1-5 , rolls several times and then 
catches fire . First, we are told that their back tire blew out, sending 
them out of control. Then, we hear they were driving 85 mph. 
Finally, we are told that open alcohol containers found inside the 
van may have played a part in the accident. 

THE END 
* * * Remember in high school when you'd get wasted with your 

friends and then try to sneak back home so your parents wouldn't 
know you had been drinking? The consequences of being caught 
always far outweighed the risk of driving home. I remember. And 
the more I hear from the campaign against drunk driving the clearer 
those days of adolescence come to mind . 

Local radio stations, our own AS and even beer and liquor 
companies are spreading the word that drinking and driving don't 
mix.lt's a wonhy cause and not only Increases pubhc awareness of 
the problem but ultimately saves lives - maybe even ¥ours. 

But every time I hear another slogan those days of ~1.8h school 
come f1asning back to mind Wlm the hidden gratification of 
drinking and getting away with it. We seem to be saying, "it's okay 
to drink as long as you don't drive" instead of saying "it's okay to 
Idrive as long as you don't drink." Who are we kidding? It's the 
alcohol. nO( the car. that causes the accidents. But we don't want to 
give up our precious drink. 

Case-in-point: TGs. Free beer is given to all students 21-years-
old or over. How many of those students live on campus? Very few. 
How many stay on campus after the TG is over? Very few. How 
many get in their cars and drive somewhere off campus? Most of 
them. Alcohol is the key to the problem of drunk driving, yetour AS 
is giving it away for free and our radio stations are encouraging 
people to drive across town for dnnk speCIals (and then dnve back 
across town to get home.) 

We tried prohibition and that didn't work. We're trying CHP 
roadblocks, but they're expensive to keep going year 'rouna, and 
they make all of us fed like we're living in a police state. Stiff fines or 
jail sentences only work for those wbo get caught. So what's the 
answer? What will it take to StOP the drunken slaughter of 
thousands of innocent people) 

Ask the SDSU crew team. ~ 

the remaining credit which is 
done on the register. This plan 
enables sutudents to eat exactly 
what they want and when they 
want. Upon paying, a receipt will 
be given to the student to check 
his figures with . A register like 
those at the delis could be 
programmed to do this . When 
the student's account gets low. 
he depOSits more money.

Editor: 
Lyndon LaRouche is the 

Howard Beale of politicS. Beale, 
you may recall , was the lunatic 
nightly news anchorman for the 
ficticious television network 
"UBS" in the award winning 
movie Network . Beale's insaniry 
was displayed in his off-the-
teleprompter lectures about there 
being international conspiracies 
involving governments. mega-
banks and multi-national 
corporations. His lunacy 
culminated with a promise to 
blow his brains out after 
tomorrow's live newscast. 

Beale's spiels , seasoned with 
high-pitched emoti onal appeals, 
struck a responsive chord among 
viewers resulting in a 
tremendous ratmgs surge for the 
usua ll y last-place network. Beale 
was soon awarded hiS Own show

a loyal audience of mllhons.

Explosive motives 

Editor: 
The astronaUls are home, late Jo r 

their own Junerals. 
It wasn't long after the 

explosion in January that the 
nation rushed to memorialize the 
Challenger crew, deliver sad 
speeches of remembrance and 
farewell, call for still more glory 
with sacrifice and perform the 
Missing Man overflight. With the 
arrival of flag-drapped coffins to 
Dover Air Force Base, a new 
cycle of honors for the dead will 
begin, which is fitting. 

They are as heroes from a war, 
but what was the battle , who the 
enemy? Some would say that 
they died exploring the Space 
Frontier, that dangerously 

unpredictable realm inhabited by 
all the monsters of imagination. 
Others have pointed to 
"management decisions" and the 
fact that adding another item to 
a long list of things to fix would 
delay the Program and render 
Shuttle Operations uneconomical. 

In its relatively brief history. 
the U.S. Space Program has been 
an exercise in perfection with 
risk. A typical task for an 
aerospace engineer is to uncover 
all possible ways a spacecraft 
part can lead to major failure . 
The January 1967 Apollo I fire 
was not anticipated. The Shuttle 
conflagration of 19 years later 
was prophesied with uncanny 
accuracy. 

The shocking deaths of 
astronauts Grissom, White and 
Chaffee launched the drive to 
perfection that culminated in the 
firs t lunar landing in 1969. We 
must conclude that this attitude 
of perfection has lost favor with 
the forces of management in the 
present day. Witness the

NASA! This shouldn 't be 
happe ning!" was my reaction. I 
was as helpless, in my distant 
role as a taxpayer, as those 
engineers who wanted a delay to 
learn a little more about their 
spacecraft. 

Has the pront motive and the 
pressure to stick to a schedule 
submerged the spirit of 
excellence we once associated 
with NASA and its activities? 
With a shabby shuttle program. 
where can we go? Will the glory 
and per~ction of the lunar 
landings ever be seen again by 
this country? 

What affects me most today, 
months later, is the sense that 
the disaster was an omen for the 
rest of us. Perched on explosive 
powers. we are managed by 
human organizations that are 
driven by motives infmitely more 
complex and erratic than the 
simple curiOSity that drives us to 
explore space. The engineers 
with their prophesies are 
amongst us, and we are not

In response to a UC 

systemwide call for actions 
around South Africa this 
Thursday and Friday to coincide 
with the UC Regents meeting in 
Berkeley, the Anti-War Action 
Committee (AWAC) is setting up 
its first shanties in Reve lle Plaza. 
In taking this action, we are 
followi ng the example of our 
fellow students at Berkeley, 
UCLA, UCSB, UCSC, Riverside, 
Davis and Irvine. We hope that 
this is the beginning of our own 
symbolic shantytown. that others 
will join us, that together, we can 
create a community.

and a half. We came tOgether to 
lorce the UCSD Admtnlsmlt10n 
and the UC Regents to 
implement the four student 
refcrenda which were passed last 
year and again this year by 
overwhelming majorities. These 
referenda are: 

. No recruitment by the 
militalY. FBI. the CIA or the 
Immigration and 
Naturalization Servce (Mlgra) 
on our campus or through our 
Carcer Planning and 
Placement Centcr (built With 
our student fees) . 
• UC divestment from 
corporations and banks doing 
business in South Africa . 
. UC divestment from the Lo 
Alamos and Livermore nuclcar 
labs. 
. That UCSD be delared a 
sanctuary for refugees from 
Central America and that thc 
Migra not be allowed to 
operate on our campus. 
Our first series of actions, the 

sit-ins and teach-ins at our 
Career Center, focused on the 
referenda involving recruitment. 
Our second action, the 
construction of the shantytOwn, 
focuses on the referend um 
involving divestment from South 
Africa. We do not engage in this 
ac tion lightly. We sym pathize 
with the concern. expressed by 
some of our progressive friends. 
that it is somehow inappropriate 
for a group of largely white 
middle-class U.S. students. who 
have never experienced the 
poverry of a true shantytOwn in 
South Africa or Tijuana, to 
tonstruct a shantytown on a 
college campus in the middle of 
La Jolla. Yet we think that the 
beneft tS of creati ng the 
shantytown outweigh the COSts. 
We hope in this action , as we 
did in our first series of actions, 
to educate and organize not only 
the broader student population 
but also ourselves. Funhermore, 
we are inspired by the example 
set by our fellow students at all 
the other UC campuses as well 
as around the country. 
E\'e rywhere they have been 
constructed , shantytOwns have 
had a positive impact on both 
the activities involved and the 
broader'student population. 

FInally, we ask others to join 
us. Following the example set by 
the students at Berkeley and 
UCLA, we ask faculty , staff and 
student organizations. academic 
departments, groups of friend s. 
the co-ops. the SMC groups, th e 
Coaituon for a Free outh Afnca. 
community organizations. unions 
and others to build their own

Cafe opens after months of secrecy 
Cont i nlled trom page 1 

In May of 1985. the AS 
approved the cafe as a new 
service and allocated $10,000 to 
Carlson to begin construction . 
The use of Craft Center 
employees and volunteers kept 
the cost below $17,000 , said A.S . 
President Mary Ro e Alexander. 
"The extra $7 .000 was taken 
from the services unallocated 
account in the A.S .... Alexander 

replied . "The Cafe is pan of the 
craft center. We are not breaking 
University Policy. We are Simply 
reassigning this space to provide 
a different service." 

The space (a deck) was 
originall y used for pOttery 
displays , but the deck. according 
to Alexander. was built last 
summer specifically for the cafe. 

According to UCSD Cam pus 

gone through the campus 
architect and stated "All I know 
is that the A.S. approved the 
allocation of money. As far as 
poliCies on building, we didn't 
need to worry about those 
things." 

"If we went through the sc hool 
it would take years (to gain 
permission to build): he added . 

When asked if University 
policy was being breached by 
building the cafe. Carlson said. "I 
don 't know the twelve volumes of 
university policy ... actually we 
are following policy. We are 
going to open and invite an 
inspector from Health and Safety 
to come over and we'll see what 
their reaction will be." 

According to Bill Bernard of 
UCSD Environmental Health and 
Safety. the normal procedure for 
approving new food services is 
to have an insr ection prior to 

_ the opening 0 a food (and 
6 drink) service and to schedule 
~ routine inspectiOns periodically 
'" thereafter . 

by allOWing a sequence of four 
advenisements and anicles to be 
published in the Guardian, the La 
Jolla Light. a fraternity newspaper. 
and on the job board at the 
Career Services Center. 

"The menu is simple," said 
Silen. "We ofTer designer type 
coffees, meaning cappucino and 
espresso along with teas and 
regular cofTee." 

'''Coffee prices range from 45~ 
for a regular coffee to $1.45 for a 
double espresso," Silen said , and 
added "We will be using 
handmade ceramic mugs. made 

at the Craft Center that will also 
be on sale." 

The existing food services in 
the Student Center, including the 
Triton Pub and the Food Co-op, 
stated that they did not feel 
there would be an "excess of 
competition" between them and 
the new cafe. 

Carlson agreed, "None of these 
food services rely on coffee as a 
main source of income ... the co-
op doesn 't even serve it and the 
pub sure doesn't rely on it. They 
serve hot brown fluid," said 
Carlson. ~

The success of the UCSD 
International Center has spurred 
a $450,000 expansion project 
funded through private and 
university sources, according to 
Mary Dhooge. director of the 
International Cemer. 

The additions include new 
office space for the 
Opportunities Abroad program, 
conference rooms, a dining room 
for tutors and a women's group 
and an expand ed resale shop , 
Dhooge said. 

The center, begun 14 years 
ago primarily by the community, 
provides services for the entire 
UCSD communi ty, including a 
lutorial program for foreign 
students and scholars. an 
exchange/ malching program, a 
cafe, a cooperative nursety run 
by parents and an international 
club. 

said . "We made a deal with 
Carlson that if we gave him the 
money to build , he would do the 
work. So all profits and losses are 
shared 50/ 50 by the AS and the 
Craft Cemer," said Alexander. 

Planner Jeffrey Steindorf, 'To 
build on existing structures does 
not require my approval, but 
probably should go through the 
campus architect." 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
"had known all along about the 
cafe and were in favor of it." 

When asked about the 
controversy surrounding the 
legality of building additions on 
to existing structures, Carlson 

Steindorf claims that he was 
not aware of a cafe bei ng built 
on campus. 

Alexander did not know if the 
plans for building the cafe had 

E£fons were made by Carlson 
to keep the publiCity about the 
cafe "low key" to prevent any 
more delays. by making a verbal 
co ntract with Silen to' hold on all 
advenisi ng until th e opening 
today. 

"We hope to see more usage 
(of the cemer) because [he only 
thing limiting us now IS the 
space," Dhooge added. 

The offices will expand 
current center capacity. Dhooge 

"It 's not Just a place for a 
foreign student. There's lots of 
opponunities ior a UCSD 
studem to be involved and gain 
international experience without 
leaving the campus." Dhooge 

Silen breached the agreement said. IZ:J

Planting the SEEDs of education 
By EVA WONG, Contributing Editor 

Y OU'\!E probably seen the Bike-Aid '86 Pedalling for Progress flyers 
around the UCSD campus and 
in the community at large . After 
close scrutlny you notice that the 
sponsor is not a corporate 
organization, but the Overseas 
Development etwork (00 ), a 
coalition of stud ent groups 
seeking to educate other college 
students and the community 
about developments on the 
intemanonallevel. 

Students Encouragmg 
Education and Development 
(SEED), UCSD's 00 affiliate , 
has been m existence since the 
middle of last quarter. ays 
Mansa Saunders, a co-preSident 
of SEED, who learned of ODN 
abroad last year In Spain , "Little 
by little we got these weekly 
meetings gomg; the same people 
kept commg back and now 
the)' re members. We are a smaU 
group , but we're a quali ty group ." 

0 0 , which wa ' founded In 
1983, came out of the concern 
and need for indi Viduals to act 
upon the situations of the 
millions impoverished In the 
Third World countries. Says 
member Christine Tom , "There 

According to Saunders, ' We are 
planning two fund raisers, one 
being Bike-Aid onJune 14,and the 
other being a fast on May 22. Both 
of these fund raisers would allow us 
to sponsor our own proJect." The 
project that SEED has proposed to 
ODN would either be in Mexico or 
a Latin American country because 
of their proximity to San Diego. 
According to Jacob aeb, the other 
co-president of UC D's ODN 
chapter, another reaso n for 
starting a project in Latin America 
is that a lot of the work is already 
being done m Afnca and Asia. Says 

aeb "BaSically what each campus 
does is select a project that they 
want to sponsor; they ralse funds, 
and the fund s go into a big pool " 

aeb ontinues, "We can take 
money from those funds, and the 
nice thing about the pool is that, 
say a project needs 5000 and 
we have n't raises 5000 yet, we 
can take money from that pool. 
Large corporations and certain 
people have donated money to 
thiS pool , what we do then IS 
work fro m that." Saunders 
believes ODN to be a very 
distinct organl:ation because , as 

aeb says, "The programs are 
designed so that we can go in, -
do the programs, give them (the 

Mansa Saunders, co-preSident oj SEED at UCSD. 

are 40 chapters of (JON 
nanonally each of which 
oversees a project In a Third 
World country." According to the 

ew Yorll fimes , "rhe Overseas 
Development Network is the 
fastest growing organization of 
its type ." Says Saunders, "At the 
first meeting, Christine came up 
with the name SEED; until then 
we were Just called 'ODN chapter 
at UCSD.-

underdeveloped country being 
aided ) help and then they can 
conllnue Irom there. elf-
surn lency IS the primary goal, 
not JUSt feeding people." 

Saunders adds, "These projects 
that they (the people of the. 
country being aided ) have 
initiated , they have come up 
with the prop als, and they 
want to see it come about , but 

they don't have the means to 
actually begin the project, 
whether technical or financial." 
Says Tom, one of the things that 
really drew her to ODN was that , 
"you could ac tually make a 
diffe rence across the world, you 

thing about being a part of an 
affiliated network is that it gives 
us a background for information 
and the whole set-up of ODN 
gives us a basis to what we are 
doing. We're not starting out 
totally new; we have a support 

I / I 

organizaiom of Bike-Aid , the 
members of SEED "have gone 
through a huge learning 
experience, nm only in the 
organizational sense, but in fund 
raising and in putting on 

~mething like this. We're also 

SEED member Christine Tom and co-preSident Jacob Naeb 

could di rect your concern into 
direct action for helping other 
people help themselves." 

"Projects that are being 
executed in these other countries 
offer internships at the same 
time ," according to Saunders. 
"There's a project in Bangledesh, 
and there's one in Zimbabwe. 
Though most of these 
internships are voluntary, they 
offer students a chance to really 
see the development of the 
project to learn ." 

ODN's three goals are , 
Partnership in Development 
Program , which links its chapters 
to the Third World through the 
sponsorship of a program in a 
developmg country The 
Developm(: nt Education Program 
which educates ODN affilia tes of 
Third World concerns and the 
Development Opponunltes 
Program which provides an 
opportunity for a person to 
expenence hvmg In an overseas 
location for three to six months. 
Says Saunders, "Each chapter 
kind of takes It on its own on 
how It 'S run and sponsored . We 
take on these three objectives 
because they are 00 's goals, 
but we can go anywhere with 
them. Right now, JUSt because 
we're beginning, we could take a 
million roads." 

aeb adds, "Like Marisa says, 
baSica lly it's up to us; and 
though we have ge neral 
guidelines, It 'S totally up to the 
students, the people who are the 
members of the organization, as 
to what we do. They are people 
With specihc strengths and 
Interests, and we want to draw 
upon these becausc we are not 
already pre-determined " SEED 
give people a chance to do 
somethlOg they're interested 111 
and can actually pur uc . 

With 00 there i the 
individual/local organizati on, as 
well as the supportive/ national 
organization. ays Tom, "One 

system, yet we can deviate as we 
please ." 

Bike-Aid '86 exemplifies the 
combination of both local and 
national organizations. SEED will 
be handling the San Diego/ Los 
Angeles route of the 3300-mile 
journey across America . 
According to Naeb, through the 

learning a trememdous amount 
about how things work here on 
the UCSD campus and in the 
community." Saunders adds, 
"One of our major goals is to 
spread out beyond the campus, 
and reach the entire community 
on awareness of 
underdevelopment." ~ 

Discovering 
international trade 
By ROBERT OSBORN 

I entered the ominous building of the Insmure of the Americas, 
north of Third College, with a mission in mind: to attend a 
symposium on business in Latin America and East Asia. Thl' 
Institute had always seemed to be relatively aloof from the day-to-
day trivialities of undergraduate life at UCSD; but since I managed 
to get an invitation from the Institute on such short notice , the idea 
of attending a symposium there wasn 't as intimidating as before. 

I was soon to discover, however, why this symposium was nOt 
open to the general public . Members on th e panel for discussion 
included the former president of Panama, C.E.O.'s of various 
corporations from the Pacific Basin and several directors of 
mult inational banks. Unfortunately, despite the broad spectrum of 
internationl representation, there were no representatives from the 
People's Republic of China or Taiwan. 

They symposium was divided into three sessions: Government-
Business Relations, Foreign Investment and Transfer ofT ech nology 
and Trade Problems and Policies. From my understanding, the 
main goals of ·this sympOSium were to set a foundation for 
international business relations in the Pacific Basin and to discuss 
some of the issues concerning the future of trade relations in both 
public and private sectors. 

Many members of the panel expressed enthusia m and 
optimism conceming their own country's future in the PaCific Basi n 
market. However, the Korean, Japanese and Latin American 
businessmen aU expressed conce rn about the present u.S. policy 
on markct proteCtiOOlsm. One panel member referred ro this p licy 
as a "dark. cloud" which was severely limit ing the export capabilities 
of ounmes like Korea or BraZil who depend on exporting to the 
United SGites to pay their nanonal debts. 

Fro.m what I. observed , thi sympos ium seemed to successfully 
establish a baSIS for future bUSiness relations in the Pacific Basin 
while also allowing indiVidual countries to present lear pictures of 
their economic capabili tcs. I wouldn't be surprised if future 
conferences oflh is SOrt help pave the way tOward the establishment 
of the new Paci fic Rlln School of Intemarional Relati ons at U SD. 

Tritons hope to 
get world serious 
UCSD takes on 
Stanislaus in best of 5 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Spans Editor 

F INALL Y, THE two best teams in the western region of Division III ball 
will detennine who is going to 
represe nt the west in the College 
World Series, May 29-June I in 
Marrieta, Ohio. Cal State 
Stanislaus and UCSD's baseball 
team will square off this weekend 
in Turlock, Northern California 
in a beSt of five game series to 
determine the winner. 

After last year's fia;;Co (in 
which the twO best teams, 

Senior shortstop Dan Petersen 
hopes his last games with UCSD 
are his best. 

including UCSD, were excluded 
from playoffs while Redlands -
with a stacked schedule - made 
it by virtue of their first place 
finish in the SCIAC conference), 
~the two best teams," according 

to UCSD coach Lyle Yates, will 
play for the honor this year. 

"We're just glad to be in and 
playing again," said Yates, "and 
we feel that these teams are 
the twO best. It should make for 
a great series. n 

Sta nislaus' coach was in 
agreement. "We haven't seen the 
scouting repons yet," said Dave 
Cook, "but we know that UCSD 
has a tough offense . We have a 
good offense, too, so it should be 
a good series." 

Yates, who also had nOt 
received the scouting repons 
from the NCAA, did talk to both 
the Sonoma and USF coaches 
who had played Stanislaus. 
'They're a real scrappy club," 
said Yates, "and apparently are 
never out of a game. They've 
made a habit of coming back in 
the late innings." 

Both clubs are on a roll 
coming into the playoffs, 
although Stanislaus may have the 
edge because the Tritons haven't 
played for two weeks. Stanislaus 
(2 1-18) won five of its last six 
games to edge out Oaremont 
(22-18) and LaVerne (21-18), 
and was chosen due to their 
schedule difficulty; the toughest 
of aD Division UI teams in the 
West. The Tritons come in 
having won 13 of their last 
15. Their schedule was the 
second toughest in Division II 
western play. 

The series should feature a lot 
of offense, The Tritons batted an 
in4redible .329 as a team 
(eclipsing the old mark in 1984 
of ,289), and hi! more homeruns 
ana drove in more RBIs than any 
other Triton team in history. 
Their 22-16-1 record was the 

"fi best ever for UCSD, and marked 
'eo the filSt time they had ever 
It eclipsed the .500 mark at the 
:5 end of the season. Stanislaus, 

~ according to Cook, won most of ~their games this year by virtue of 
] their ability to "outscore people." 

~ "We've only got one good 
pitcher and our bullpen has been 
inconsistent all year. That's been 
our biggest problem - pitching 
inconsistency," Cook said. 

Stanislaus' ace, Pete 
Moidonado, has put up with 
some impressive numbers on the 
year. Moldonado was 12,,3 on 
the year, with a respectable 3.29 
ERA. Other than that , Stanislaus 
cannot match the depth of 

Bob Natal (.389, 15 HRs, 55 RBIs) is the big man in the Triton ' offense. 

Thursday, May 15, 1986 9 

Coach Lyle Yates tried to keep the Tritons Jresh during a two-week layoff. 

UCSD pitching. Cook said that 
he would use Moldonado twice , 
Friday and Sunday, but only if 
there is a need for Sunday'S 
double-header. 

The key to stopping Stanislaus, 
Yates said, "is to keep the 
bullpen consistency that has 
helped UCSD get to the 
playoffs." "If we can beat their 

ace, and keep their center-fielder 
Jeff Hintz off the bases, we'll be 
in good shape - we're vety 
confident." 

Cook seemed far more 
nervous than Yates. "I think the 
key to the series will be our 
defense - we need to play good 
defense. When we kick it around 
we're in trouble. We've also got 

AIR JORDAN: 2nd runner up_ 

to stop their catcher (Bob Natal) 
and their leadoff hitter (David 
Stanovich). What's happened in 
the past is irrelevant - it's a 
whole new season now." 

Both teams are hoping that 
the new season will last - at 
least until June I when the 
Division I1I National champions 
are crowned. ~ 

A Sunday on"the Champs-Elysees 
~~~,. By TOM SCANLON 

M OST 15-year-old boys in Southern California spend their summers 
going to the beach and chasing 
after Is-year-old girls. Not me. I 
spent the summer of 1982 in the 
fabulous city of Paris, France. 

While living in a remarkable 
18th-century townhouse in the 
heart of the city, I explored all of 
the extraordinary sights and 
monuments and admired the 
beautiful old bridges, elaborate 
architecture and lovely parks. But 
the most impressive Sight in 
Paris is the Champs-Elysees on 
the last Sunday of July. On this 
day, the famed avenue is the 
sight of the finish of France's 
most prestigious sporting event: 
the Tour de France. 

The Tour de France is 
undoubtedly one of the most 
grueling tests of athletic ability . 
One-hundred and forty of the 
world's finest cycliSts compete in 
the month-long, 2,sOO-mile race 
through all of France. The race is 
both physically and mentally 
demanding as it travels not only 
through the Pyrenees mountains 
in the south of France, but also 
the Alps on the eastern border, 
When the final stage is 
completed in Paris, only about 
ll5 riders rcmain; the rest are 
forced to withdraw due to injury 
or exhaustion. 

On most days, the Champs-
Elysees is not unlike other major 
streets in big cities. Its six-lane 
surface is jammed wih cars and 
its sidewalks are normally 
flooded by pedestrians, But on 
the day of the Tour, the 
Champs-Elysees takes on a new 
personality. Early in the day, the 
treet is cordoned off to traffic . 

The wom, red brick surface lays 
pea dully till, free from the 
constant pressure of cars and 
trucks. The Arc de Triomphe

FORA

Indoor Soccer Arrives at UCSD 
This past weekend UCSD got its first taste of real American soccer, 

indoor soccer. The Intramural Department hosted the first ever Sun God 
Indoor Soccer tournament. Nope, no more of those boring outdoor 1-0 
sleeper games. It was rock 'em, sock 'em and shoot 'em up excitement, 
indoor soccer style that is! 

There was some trepidation on the part of the intramural department. 
What would happen? Broken lights on the ceiling, broken heads, Friday 
night at the fights. Intramural czar Scott Berndes was heard ~o hav~ sai~, 
"From what I have heard, anything short of World War 1lI and I II conSider It 
a success." 

But Scott's fears never materialized . The tournament was a tremendous 
success. So much so that the Intramural Department is considering 
instituting a permanent Indoor Soccer intramural league in the future . You 
see, this indoor tournament was not JUS! a one-time indoor soccer 
tournament. It was a test tube, baby. The powers to be were watching very 
closely to see what happened. An out of hand bloodbath, and it was the first 
and last indoor soccer tournament; a fun time had by all, and it would be the 
beginning of UCSD's newest intramural sport. All of you aficionados should 
thank aU who played because they all partiCipated in the true intramural 
spirit, for fun . This will become the first of many more indoor soccer events 
played at UCSD. 

As far as the actual tournament itself, the competition was keen . In the 
open division a team made up of mostly intercollegiate soccer players 
cleaned up on the competition. Led by Greg'TU Shoot Anytime , Anywhere" 
Schwartz and Denis "Never Trust the Ref' Gunridge, they won the tide over 
UCSD's version of the Avis rent-a-car, Trier II, 11-3. Greg also tied for the 
most goals in the tournament averaging four goals per game. 

In the limited division the class of the division was the always tough Pars 
team. Pars usually plays in the AAA division in intramural soccer, so it 
seemed they might breeze through. But they met a scrappy Phi Delta Theta 
squad in the final. Pars won in the final 6-3 but had to work very hard to 
defeat the Phi Delts. The game came down to a batde between the 
tournament's leading scorer, Ross Kay, and the Pars' MVP, Hamed Eamai. 
Hamed got the better of a very old and tired Ross, three goals to two, setting 
the tone for the Pars victory.

forget that in the Coed A leagues the 
top two teams will all be put together to 
form a Coed AA playoff and the third 
and fourth place league finishers will 
compete for the Coed A crown. The 
current Coed AA leagues will add a 
letter and become the Coed AAA. 

Some big games were played this 
weekend" . Team Bozo vs. No. 1 
Combat II in Coed AA. This was a game 
between the defending champion 
Combat team and the team yours truly, 
the Budman, picked to win it aU this 
year, Team Bozo. As you all know, the 
Budman is never wrong. Led by the 
dudes from out of state, Bill "no gut" 
Dooley and Keith "I drink Bud" 
Cramer, Team Bozo easily defeated 
Combat 15-3, ... In another big Coed 
game, preseason favorite and No. 1 

Softball Notes 

rated McDonald's Farm Team was 
upset by Biddy's Batters 11-7 in a game 
of sandbaggers. These two teams have 
as much talent as any team in IMs. 
Biddy' Batters are led by one of the 
most talented twins on campus Robert 
Vacheron . (How many sets of twins are 
there anyway?) Look for it to be a 
familv affair in the Coed final with 
Robert's Biddy's Batters meeting 
Phillip's Swinging Single Club. 

Intramural oddity: Not one of the 
thirty-seven softball leagues has more 
than one undefeated team. Whatever 
happened to plurality?

For Robyn Hunt, theatre is 
truly a work of love, with the 
rewards and headaches that 
only love can work. Graduate 
of the UCSD theatre program 
(MFA), visiting lecturer with 
the communications depart-
ment, artistic director at the 
Bowery Theatre, she remains 
forever an actor. Speaking to a 
large lecture class this 
quarter, she confessed that 
she teaches not just to survive, 
but to support her theatre 
habit. 

To make live theatre is, for 
her, the only way to survive. 
Hunt has refused to throw 
herself into the search for 
T,V. and film roles, In recent 
years, she has worked with the 
San Diego Public Theatre 
(where she received a San 
Diego critics' best actress 
award in Hedda Gabler). Now, 
she and two other" survivors" 
from the Public Theatre, Espe 
Gallardos (who works design 
with UCSD drama) and Steve 
Pearson (on the drama faculty 
here), have taken on the work 
of the Bowery, a small 
intimate space at 5th and Elm. 

For Hunt and her partners, 
the journey through the S.D. 
Public Theatre to the Bowery, 
has been almost a circular 
pilgrimage, a returning to 
home. This became clear 
when she spoke of the 
evolution of the work that led 
them to the Bowery and back 
again. 

ROBYN HUNT: We formed 
the San Diego Public Theatre at 
&h and K, downtown, But 
before we had that space, we 
didn't have a home and the first 
,ear we started we went to Kim 
McGalum who just started the 
Bowery, and said, "Would:you 
let u.s be here on )lOur dark 
nights!' and he was very gracious 
and said surf, So we per{omedon 
Mondays, Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays - in 19~b, it was 
- at the Bowery, We would 
have to strike the set, the, would 
do a show, and then we would 
come in late Sunday night and set 
up - we were like gypsies, But 
Kim let us be there, and that's 
where we first met him,

by ken furie . 
What's this about? I'U tell )IOU. 
It's about corruption and 
injustice. 

This quote by Jack 
Moniker, played by Robin 
Williams in the film Club 
Paradise, isn't really true if It is 
meant to pertain to the film. 
What is Club Paradise about? 
It's about getting together a 
group of well-known zany 
actors to play zany characters, 
caught in a zany situation, 
which all in all makes a fairly 
silly movie. 

Club Paradise isn't awful. It 
just doesn't have any punch. It 
seems too manufactured. It 
pretends to have concern for 
issues of imperialism, but it 
seems more likely that the 
themes were coincidental 
discoveries, uncovered while 
the writers sought for some 
type of complication to their

Continued from page 1 
HIATUS: You folded your 
tents every week? 
R. HUNT: We did, it was 
grueling. So then we rented a 
place that was called the Wing 
Cafe, in Golden Hill. Whoopie 
(Goldberg) used to do 
monologues there. It was just a 
little, tiny garage that was sort of 
a feminist place. We rented it 
and did four shows there. It only 
sat maybe 29 to 3.5 peale - 40 
when it was really booked. So 
then we got the 8th and K space, 
and we had that a couple of 
years. It eventually became way 
too expensive and we just really 
couldn't afford to keep it. It was 
in prime property, you know, 
oowntown. So we gave it up and 
went to Japan again, last 
summer, to work with My. 
Suzuki. When we came back to 
San Diego, there were all these 
messages from the Bowery. 

It turned out that Kim 
McCallum had gotten a job with 
Mark Medoff, who wrote

Children of:1 Lesser God and 
When You Coming Back, Red 
Rider? Kim had been doing a lot 
of Medoff pLays ... Kim's a 
terrific actor as well as a good 
director, and Medoff brought 
him to New Mexico in a teaching 
position within the theatre 

department there at Los Cruces. 
So they (the Bowery & Kim) 
needed somebody to kind of run 
the ship . They asked us if we 
were interested in working there 
until Kim came back. W e 
needed places to perform so we 
said yes, of course. 

Next week , on the 22nd of 
May, the Bowery will be 
opening a play written from 
the letters of Sylvia Plath, the 
noted American poet who 
tragically succeeded in taking 
her own life. Letters Home was 
put together by Rose Leiman 
Goldemberg, who went to 
Sylvia Plath's mother to ask 
for help in writing a pLay. 

About Letters Home, Hunt 
said: 

Sylvia wrote 696 letters in a 
really short period of time, to her 
mother and her family and her 
brother. They were published 
and Rose went to the mother, 
Aurelia Plath, and said "1 
would really like to write a play 
because Sylvia Plath stood for so 
many things. She's so important 
to all of us that I really think 1 
could write a play that will 00 
justice to her life, and to you." 
Rose went up to Connecticut 
where Aurelia lives and after a 
long, intense weekend, Aurelia 
said yes, and gave her more 
thinRs. 

So every word is written by 
Sylvia Plath or by her mother, 
orchestrated by the play-
wright into something, but 
every ward, every sentence is 

something that she really 
wrote. 
HIATUS: There are letters 
also from her mother? 
R. HUNT: From her mother, or 
Aurelia has filled in narrative 
and explains to the audience, so 
that it's a story. Sometimes Rose 
(the playwright) made notes like, 
''They're like a cello and a violin 
here," or "They're in concert"; 
in this way, musically, 
rhythmicaLLy, it's brilliant. I 
oon't know that we'll be, you 
know - we have to live up to 
that; but the script itself is really 
i ncredib Ie . 
HIATUS: The playwright said 
things like, "These two people 
are working now like a cello 
and a violin?" 
R. HUNT: Yes, her stage 
directions, using these letters, 
suggest that the very close 
relationship of Sylvia and her 
mother. and the situation of the 
letters, feeds into a kind of 
musical way of performing. 
Voices, teLLing a story, in a fairl y 
literary form of letcers , make 
their own kind of music, which is 
somehow bigger than the sum of 
the parts, or certainly not in the 
traditional realistic kind of 1-
speak, you-speak mode. 

How much do you 
to go to college?

CLUB 
Continued from page 3 
unknown reason, do not 
resent the intrusion of 
Moniker. It is inconsistancies 
like this which detract from 
the overall success of Club 
Paradise. 

It is the acting, however, 
and the music which keeps 
this movie from being truly 
bad. 

Robin Williams is a 
talented man, and his role is 
enjoyable; he is so amiable 
and human, that he seems 
quite at home on the screen. 
Rick Moranis, of GhoscbusceTS 
fame (and more), plays a 
geeky, insecure and over-
compensating nerd, and this 
poor creature is so humorous to 
me, played meekly and 
stumblingly by Moranis, that I 
can't stop laughing at him. 

There are others who add 
greatly to the film: Brian 
Doyle-Murray plays Voit 
Zerbe, owner of the big money 
hotel on the island, and he is 
so natural as the brash, savvy 
businessman that his 
character becomes much 
more memorable than it 
would have been. Andrea 
Martin plays Linda White, a 
housewife vacationing with 
her husband in an attempt to 
save theit marriage. White 
discovers herself; she 
discovers her potential for 
adventure and enjoyment, 
and her escapades are wild and 
humorous. 

One question will lurk in 
the mind of viewers who are 
nostalgic fans. What is Peter 
O'Toole doing in this film? 
This is not to say that he 
detracts from the film; 
anything but. He is as 
charming and disarming as 
ever as Governor Hayes, 
who has run away from 
British society to hide on his 
t§land paradise. 

But O'Toole's talent 
seems wasted on zaniness. 
His is too charismatic for 
viewers not to take him 
seriously. Even in My 
Fatlorice Year his role was 
deep and also somewhat 
tragic, although comic. With 
his history, he cannot be 
made into a subordinate 
character; Hayes is certainly 
not crucial to the plot of the 
film. 

The camera occasionally 
lingers on O'Toole's face, 
and the viewer doesn't want 
it to leave. There is a 
moment at the climax of the 
film, where Hayes leads 
forth an army of natives to 
the scene of the final 
showdown, and he rides at 
the fore, bedazzled in official 
uniform. 

He progresses ahead of 
the swarming natives and is 
shown alone, galloping along 
the beach on a majestic 
stallion, with grim 
determination on his face. 
This scene is so reminiscent 
of the O'Toole's 
magnificent, charismatic, 
driven Lawrence of Arabia, 
that the viewer realizes he is 
as much out of his element 
in Club Paradise as Hayes is, 
riding in front of thousands 
of natives armed with sticks, 
clubs, and soup ladels. 

The La Jolla Civic 
University Symphony and 
Chorus will be appearing at 
UCSD's Mandeville 
Auditorium on May 24 and 
25. An all Stravinsky program 
will include the Firebird Suite. 
One of Stravinsky's most 
powerful works, the Firebird 
Suite was written for 
Diaghilev's ballet on Russian 
folk legends. Also included on 
the program is the Concerto 
in 0 for String Orchestra, the 
Symphony of Psalms for 
chorus and string orchestra, 
and a group of Russian 
peasant songs. The concerts 
are at 8 pm on Saturday the 
24th and at 3 pm on Sunday 
the 25th. General Admission 
is $5; students and senior 
citizens are $3. For 
reservation, call 452-4637. 

* * * Author Tom Wolfe, who 
wrote The Right Stuff, will 
speak on "The Novel in an 
Age of Nonfiction" 
Thursday, May 22, in 
UCSO's Main Gym. Wolfe is 
the author of a number of 
popular books, including The 
Kandy Kolored Tangerine Flake 
Streamline Bab" The Pump 
Howe Gang, and The Electric 
Kool-Aid Acid Test, which is 
about LSD and a group of 
people who drove around the 
country in a multicolored bus 
calling themselves the Merry 
Pranksters. An award winning 
journalist, Wolfe has even 

published his own drawings. 
Some of his written works put 
politics, social styles, and 
modern art in a creatively 
humorous light. Admission 
prices to this event are: 
general admission $8; seniors 
$7; students $5. Tickets are 
available through Ticket 
Master outlets and from the 
UCSD Box Office . For 
additional information, call 
452-4559. 

* * * Pat Oleszko, the " Living 
Sculpture," will be appearing 
in Sherwood Auditorium on 
May 17, as part of the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art's Viva Vaudeville! series. 
This unique performer 
models herself after the 
medieval court jester. Her 
body and costumes are her 
primary tool for communica-
ting with the audience. This 8 
pm performance, called 
"Where Fools Russian" is, 
according to OleSzko, "and 
assordid (sic) bag of tricks 
featuring elaborate costumes, 
special defects (sic), various 
media including films, 
governmental doubletalk, 
contemporary massages (sic) 
from Hiroshima and Berlin, 
the Trojan Rabbit and as a 
special detraction (sic), 
Armor-get-on." Student 
admission for all Viva 
Vaudeville! performances is 
$4. Tickets are available at the 
UCSD Box Office; call 454-

The UCSD Thea tre 

program co nrinues its 
"projects," or explorations of 
style and staging, with the 
production of Anton 
Chekhov's Three Sisters, 
Warren Theatre, May 16, 17 , 
18,22,23 & 24. 

The show is divided into 
two parts, each to be 
presented on different nights. 

Acts I and III (May 16, 18 
& 23) are directed by Beth 
Schachter, acts II and IV (May 
17,22 &24) by Ralph Janes. 

Four different designers 
work on the pLay. 

[n this structure of different 
stagings, the project explores a 
Russian vision of the turn of 
the 19th century. 

As UCSD Theatre bills it, "Three Sisters is Chekhov's moving comentary on the 
universality of human deception - that quality of blinding ourselves to the potential of 
the present as we lose ourselves in romantic dreams of the future." 

Separating the pLay into two nights' parts with different directors and designers (the 
same cast, however), students will "explore the text" and gain insight into each act. 

Special two-night tickets are available. 
Call 452-4574 for more information.
