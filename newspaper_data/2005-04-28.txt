Watson proposes athletic scholarships 
By SHANNON EUOT 

Senior Staff Writer 

UCSO student-athletes would 
be eligible to receive financial assis-
tance in two years under a new 
scholarship proposal being consid-
ered by university administrators. 
The grants-in-aid, mandated by 
the CM, would provide approxi-
mately $500 annually to each of tile 
university'S 600 athletes. 

After the university moved from 
NCAA Division III to Division II in 
2000, me CAA changed its regu-
lations, making previously optional 
ath letic scholarships a requirement. 
The new rules mandated that each 
institution must offer a minimum 
of $250,000 no later than fall 2005. 
While UCSO has received a waiver 
from such policies for this year, 
there is no guar:;ntee that it can 
obtain one in 2006-07. 

The proposal for scholar-
ships provides for a maximum of 
$300,000 in campus registration 
fee funds for athletes. Initially, me 
funds would be provided from sav-
ings and reserves, and permanent 
funding would gradually be pro-
vided by growth in student enroll-
ment. The plan states that the 

expenditure commitment will not 
impact annual allocations of per-
manent and temporary funding 
to the Registration Fee Advisory 
COIlllnittee. However, there is no 
guarantee at this point as to which 
student programs will be affected 
by the new plan. 

"The Registration Fee 
Committee annually reviews a large 
number of budget proposals and rec-
ommends those considered to be of 
highest priority and greatest benefit 
to students," said Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W . Watson, 
the primary author of the plan. "It 
is therefore not possible to state 
which particular programs would or 
would not be funded by the funds in 
question." 

AS leaders have backed the 
plan. 

"This is an investment into 
the future of our campus," A.S. 
Commissioner of Athletics Bryce 
Warwick stated in an e-mail. "I 
think this is a very well-designed 
and solid way for UCSO to appre-
ciate the efforts of its student-
athletes and to take another step 
toward bolstering an athletic pro-
gram that has shown tremendous 
results and has been a growing 

Atkinson withdraws 
naming consideration 

8y W1LUAM CHING 
Staff Writer 

Former UC President and 
UCSO Chancellor Richard C. 
Atkinson has withdrawn himself 
from naming considerations for 
Sixth College less than a week 
after A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten, joined by a group of stu-
dents wearing all black, held an 
April 22 rally in Price Center to 
protest the lack of student input 
in the naming process. 

In an e-mail sent to the Sixth 
College community, Provost 
Gabriele Wienhausen stated that 
Atkinson has requested to have 
his name withdrawn from further 
consideration. Administrators 
had previously chosen Atkinson's 
name for the college, a decision 
opposed by some students. 

"Should President Atkinson 
choose not to reconsider his deci-
sion, the process is suspended," 
Wienhausen stated. "As Provost, 
I will explore with memben of 
the Sixth College community 
how best to procccd." 

Sillth College studenu, as 
well as members of the Student 
Affirmative Action Comminee, 
had called on the coli. admin-
iSb'.tors to stop their decision to 
name the coli. after Atkinson 
prior to his request in favor of a 
more open renaming process. 

"There is a void in the commu-
nity," Sweeten said. "In this case, it 
is the mice of the students." 

Thur«ood Manhall College 

senior Victor Huynh, who 
attended the rally as the president 
of the Asian and Pacific-Islander 
Student Alliance and a member of 
SAAC, said the event was a means 
to get the attention of both stu-
dents and the administration. 

"We hope that the black-
out is a starting point where we 
can engage the administration," 
Huynh said. "We are trying to 
reach those certain few students 
who do care to become more 
involved in the school." 

Huynh also said that he is frus-
trated that students are unable to 
give their opinions on the future 
name of the college. 

"We have a strong opinion on 
how we like to see the campus 
develop," Sweeten said. 

After an April 24 meeting with 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, 
Sweeten said that the chancellor 
has agreed to attend a May 5 town 
hall forum on the subject at the 
Cross-Cultural Center. 

Earlier this month, the AS. 
Council passed a resolution endors-
ing the blackout and opposed 
the naminJ of the coIIqe after 
AdIinson. The resolution aIio aiti-
cizes the current name-seIcction 
process for not taking adequate 
student input into account. 

"The MUCSn understands 
that the nami. of Sixth CoIl. 
after Richard C. Atkinscn would 
be an insult to the strugles of 
underrepresented students on this

positive influence on the campus. 
The plan will help improve our 
teams, and better teams are easier 
to promote." 

The plan would be implement-
ed anywhere from 12 to 24 months 
after its approval, according to 
Watson. Authors and sponsors of 
the plan, including the department 
of athletics and student affair, are 
seeking endorsement by the faculty 
Academic Senate as a prerequi -
site for sublni sion to Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox for approval and 
adoption. 

"The proposal to use registra-
tion fee funds to provide the foun-
dation funding for the student-
athlete grants-in-aid is made in 
the belief that such an expenditure 
should be a high priority because 
of the major positive impacts it 
will have on student life and school 
spirit at UCSO," Watson stated in 
an e-mail. 

UCSO Athletics Director Earl 
W . Edwards said that the proposal 
is backed by his department as well 
as those who work with athletes 
because it is based on what he calls 
a "democratic distribution" model

Committee 
mulls change in 

retake policy 
8y NAYEU PAGAZA 

Contributing Writer 

In an effort to reduce grade 
inflation, an Academic Senate com-
mittee is considering denying stu-
dents who receive a grade of "0" 
or "F" me opportunity to retake 
courses. 

Over the past two months, the 
Committee on Education Policy 
has discussed ways to address ris-
ing average grades over the past 
decade, a phenomenon witnessed 
by universities across the nation. 

Committee co-chair and physics 
professor Kim Griest said students' 
grades have become insignificant 
as more students receive "As" and 
"Bs" than 10 years ago, when the 
average grade at UCSD was a "c." 

"If everybody gets an 'A,' grades 
don't mean anything," Griest said. 

Associate Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Education Mark 
I. Appelbaum, who serves as an 
informal nonvoting member on 
the committee, said he disagrees 
that the campus has experienced 
grade in~tion, pointin« to data 
generated by the faculty that show 
the mean grade point avera~ for 
undergraduates risin« from 3.01 to 
3.05 OYer the last five years.

Council approves new 
media grievance process 

8y CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

In the wake of Student-Run 
Television's February broadcast 
of pornography, the AS. Council 
approved a media services griev-
ance procedure last week, which 
allows students to voice com-
plaints about Associated Students-
run campus media. 

"The proposal addressed con-
cerns at each level , ensuring a 
process that would allow for stu-
dents to voice their concerns," 
former AS. President Jenn Pae 
said. "If students are dissatisfied 
wim an AS. media service, then 
they should be able to address 
these concerns and have them 
dealt with appropriately." 

The procedure includes three 
ways of dealing with complaints, 
to be followed successively: the 
media service level, an informal 
resolution and A.S.Judicial Board. 
Complaints may be against spe-
cific content or simply questions 
over general governance. 

At the media service level, the 
general manager of the specific 
station must receive me com-
plaint within 30 days of me inci-
dent. After mat, the manager has 
five academic days to meet with 
the service's heads to decide on a 
response to me complaint. Their 

response is due within the next 
five days. Both a copy of the com-
plaint and response are sent to me 
A.S. executive assistant. 

An informal resolution may 
also resolve the complaint, bur 
only after an informal grievance 
group - composed of the gen-
eral manager of the media service 
facing the complaint, A.S. com-
missioner of student services, A.S. 
commissioner of communications 
and the producer of the broadca t 
- meets and decides on an infor-
mal resolution. 

If the filer of the complaint 
is not satisfied with the informal 
decision, a formal grievance may 
be reported to the AS Judi cial 
Board, which makes the final deci -
sion on any complaint concerning 
A.S. media services. The board's 
assessment of the situation will be 
based on "me g'lIidelines for pro-
gramming in the media service's 
governing documents," according 
to the grievance procedure. After 
consideration, the board will sug-
gest appropriate sanctions to the 
"principle members of the media 
service." 

KOilill editor Steve York, who 
starred in me pornographic video, 
said he appreciates me need for 
me procedure, but is wary of any

NCAA: Athletes, council 
back 'democratic distribution' 

cominued from page I 
that awards the same amount of 
money to all athletes, male and 
female. 

"Our philosophy is to treat 
all athletes the same, not neces-
sarily based on ath letic ability," 
Edwards said. "The grants-in-aid 
are to enhance athletic participa-
tion." 

Warwick said the athletes like 
the idea as well, with members of 
the Triton Athletic Council voic-
ing their approval. 

"The 'democratic distribution' 
really fits with the tradition of ath-
letics at UCSD and the athletes 
appreciate the effort to alleviate 
some of their financial burden, 
since so many of their hours are 
being spent on representing their 
university," Warwick said. 

Former A.S. President and 
A.S. Council representative to 
RFAC Jenn Pae advocated the 
plan based on the academic suc-

cess of snldent-athletes. 
"T am a huge proponent of this 

plan," Pae said. "We, as a uni-
versity, need to support our stu-
dent-athletes. They have higher 
graduation rates and grade point 
averages than the average student, 
as well as represent our university 
in athletic competitions through-
out the conference." 

Athletes would need to maintain 
certain academic standards to be 
eligible for the award. To receive 
the scholarships, continuing stu-
dents would be required to have a 
cumulative GPA of 2.50 or higher, 
with successful completion of 12 
units per quaner and 36 units in the 
previous academic year. 

UCS D is the only school of 
285 in Division II that does not 
curren tly offer any athletic scho l-
arships.

Retake: Policy would target 
recent inflation in grades 

cominued from page I 
tion exists, according to Geist. 

He said because the i sue of 
not letting students retake classes 
was only discussed once, it is not a 
set proposal and is far from being 
enacted. 

"I think it's a bad idea all 
around," A.S. Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Harry Khanna 
said regarding the policy. "It dis-
courages students from taking 
other classes, especially if they 
get an 'F' the first quarter." 

Griest, however, said he wor-
ries students who retake classes 
might have an unfair advantage 
over others who are taking the 
class for the first time. 

"I don 't know if it's fair for 
students who get 'Bs' and 'Cs' to 
not be given the opportunity to 
retake the class like those who fail 
and have a better chance of get-
ting an 'A,'" Griest said. 

Appelbaum is concerned that 
students might be "developing 
strategies" to boost their grade. 
O ne example, he said, is that stu-
dents might rather get a "W' in a 
class they are fai ling so they can 
retake it later. 

Earl Warren College sopho-
more David Oh said he used a 
similar strategy of dropping a 
class before receiving an undesir-
able grade. 

"I just didn't take the final 
for my genetics class because ] 
was probably going to get a 'C,' 
and thought it would be easier to 
take it later," O h said. "] guess it 
wasn't fair because I knew what 
to expect." 

Appelbaum said that every 
year one out of every two stu-
dents gets a "W' after fourth 
week of the quarter. 

The committee is not sure 
about what causes grade inflation, 
but Griest thinks it may also be 
due to professors or depa rtments 
giving higher grades. 

"1 know some professors curve 
grades higher in their classes," 
Shellev said. 

ApPelbaum said this pattern 
might h ave started during the 
Viemam War, when professors 
were reluctant to have students 
drop out, because they would 
automatically be drafted to the 
army. 

Alternative ideas to prohibit-
ing students from re taking classes 
include collecting grade da ta b}' 
department and professor to dis-
cern possible trends. 

"Tradition gets going and 
becomes a norm," he said. "I t's 
just the way we do things."

Murphy announces 

resignation as mayor 
In a surprise announcement 

on April 25, San Diego Mayor Dick 
Murphy told members of the media 
that he would resign from office effec-
tive July 15. 

After a grueling re-election bid 
where Murphy received fewer 
votes than write-in candidate city 
Council member Donna Frye. but was 
announced the winner because sev-
eral thousand voters did not mark the 
fi ll-in bubble next to Frye's name, the 
mayor has faced controversy over the 
city's finances and pension system. 
Earlier this month, Time magazine 
named Murphy among the three 
worst big-city mayors in the nation. 

'When I ran for re-election, I had 
hoped that my second tenn would 
be as productive as the firs~" he said 
at the press conference announcing 
his resignation. 'But that now seems 
unlikely.' 

Alluding to the city's new 'strong-
mayor" structure, which was approved 
by voters in November, Murphy said 
the city needed a leader elected by 
a 'solid majority and with a clear 
mandate.' 

VA good leader knows when it is 
time to m()\le on," he said. "It is time 
for me to move and time for a fresh 
start of the city_" 

Murphy said he would stay in 
office to finish next year's budget. 
After he leaves, the position will be 
filled by the city's vice mayor. 

Instead of appointing his succes-
sor, Murphy called on the city council 
to hold a special election in November 
that can be consolidated with a state-
wide poll in order to reduce costs for 
the city. 

Senate kills 'Students' 
Bill of Rights' 

By a 6-4 vote, the state Senate 
Education Committee voted against 
approving a "Students' Bill of Rights" 
that would have required university cur-
ricula to include 'diverse viewpoints; 
effective~ killing the measure. 

In December, the bill's sponsor 
Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) said 
his proposal was a 'new front" in the 
·war for academic freedom." 

The proposal reflected criticism from 
largely conservative students who had 
argued that they were being punished 
academically for having views that dif-
fered from those of their professors. 

"There is a national movement to 
protect academic freedom on college 
and university campuses by promot-
ing intellectual diversity and the free 
exchange of ideas, especially as it 
relates to student exposure to mul-

Roy Pak/Cuordion 

tiple points of view," the committee's 
analysis stated. 

Faculty groups, including the 
American Association of University 
Professors, which said the plan would 
infringe on the ability of faculty to con-
trol its curricula, opposed the bill. 

Though it was rejected by the 
Legisla ture, the University of 
Cafifornia's Academic Senate has 
already recommended changes to 
university policy that address some of 
Morrow's concerns.

Campus' awarded S17.2 
million grant 

The National Institute of 
Environmental Health has renewed 
UCSD School of Medicine's grant to 
fund its environmental research and 
community outreach program. The 
fiVe-year award totals $17.2 million. 

First funded in 2000, the program 
has developed new tools for poten-
tial use in detecting toxic substances 
in waterbome hazardous waste. The 
new money will be used to refine 
the tools and fund outreach to local 
tribal communities and cross-border 
populations that are most at risk by 
hazardous waste sites. 

Study: Glucose may 
stop brain damage 
A natural, nontoxic byproduct 

of Rlucose may prevent the death 
of 'brain cells and other cognitive 
impainnents in diabetics who experi· 
ence severely low blood sugar levels, 
researchers at UC San Francisco and a 
nearby medical center have found. 

The new study based on data 
gathered from rats suggests that the 
administration of the byproduct along 
with glucose after 30 minutes of a dia-
betic coma can prevent serious brain 
damage better than glucose alone. 

Glucose is a fonn of sugar used as 
fuel by the body.

THliRSDAY. APRIL 26. 200S THE UCSD GliARDIAN 

Media: SRTV, KSDT support new procedures 
continued from page I 

infringement it migh t make on free 
speech. 

"1 feel that the procedure needs 
to be t here, but I don't want to see 
UCSD go the way of censoring 
content," he said. "Reactions from 
students are great, but J wouldn't 
want to see any student group, 
whether it's the Koala or anything 
else, be ostracized because it's not 
popular with the majority." 

Publications such as the Koala, 
which are funded t1lrough the A.S . 
communications office, are not 
subject to the new grievance pro-
cedure, according to Pae. Rather, 
ptlblications are subject to proce-
dures previously established under 
the media charter, which reimburs-
es dissatisfied students with the fees 
they were charged for A.S.-funded 
publications, she said. 

In March, the A.S. Council 
approved a resolution that both 
condemned the broadcast of por-
nography on SRTV and stated a 
need to establish procedures for 
respondi ng to future grievances. 

"It had come to our attention 
that a fo rmal procedure was not in 

place if a student had a complain t 
with an A.S. media service," Pae 
said. "Therefo re, we thought it was 
necessary to have this process in 
place so that we could avoid fu rther 
confusion." 

However, some councilmem-
bers said they believe that the 
grievance procedure would only 
add more confusion. Newly-elect-
ed A.S . Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Harry Khanna voiced his 
concerns during the A.S. Cou nci l 
meeting on April 20, saying tha.t 
the procedure would only add on 
"layers of bureaucracy." 

"1 felt that I wasn 't able to fu lly 
articulate my concerns," Khanna 
said. "There already is an avenue 
to be heard, and it is ca lled the 
A.S. Judic ial Board. lntroducing 
all of these levels of informal [and] 
formal grievances does nothi ng 
because it will ultimately end up at 
the A.S . J udicia l Board on appea l. " 

Khanna said that he would have 
preferred tha t A.S. senators cla ri fy 
the charters of the media organiza-
tions in order to explicitly defin e 
what the council considers accept-
able content. 

"We should have ... reite rated 
the fact that, if someone fe lt that 
there was a violation of their char-
ter, they should talee it to the A.S. 
Judicial Board," he said. "I fee l like 
there is this pattern of making peo-
ple feel good through bureaucracy. 
Let's keep it simple, and only add 
procedure when they need to be 
added." 

Pae and SRTV officials, howev-
er, said they were ful ly satisfied with 
their procedure. Duri ng the A.S. 
Council meeting, SRTV engineer 
Andrew Tess praised the council for 
its collaboration in drafting the plan. 
In addition, Pae said a proper pro-
cedure of complain ts should always 
exist for media services. 

"T here shou ld always be a deci-
sion-making process, rather than 
one avenue for complaints to be 
addressed and final decisions to 
be made," she said. "This wi ll effi-
ciently and appro priate ly address 
complai n ts with SRTV and KSDT 
because of the steps taken in this 
process."

campus and its rich history of snl-
dent activism," the resolution states. 

Some students said they feel that 
there are alternative candidates who 
better represent Sixth College. 

"Atkinson represen ts the status 
quo. [He] does not represent the 
ideologies of San Diego - only the 
elite know of him, not the middle 
or lower class," Sweeten said. "The 
best all y of people of color is a per-
son of color." 

Currently, three of the other five 
colleges are named after white males, 
and Huynh said he would welcome 

having Sixth College named after 
someone of color, a female or some-
one of different sexual orientation. 

"I fe lt that the name should be 
reflective of the college itself," he 
said, referring to the college'S focus 
on the exploration of culture, art 
and technology. 

Associ ate Chancellor and 
Chief Diversity O ffi cer Jorge A. 
Huerta stated in an e-mail prior to 
Atkinson's announcement that he 
was in support of sticking with the 
previous naming decision. 

"I [have I nothing but positive 
things to say about Dr. Atkinson," 

• 

Huerta stated. "I do believe that 
Dr. Atkinson has worked very hard 
for all of the themes that [Sixth] 
College encompasses." 

The Sixth College Executive 
Committee has allotted only one 
seat for a student representative in 
the naming process. T he A.S. reso-
lution alleged that the lone student 
was misinformed of the meeting 
time of the committee, and was 
thus unable to fully voice student 
opinion in the decision .

rhe UCSD GuardlOn IS published tWice a week at the University of California at San Diego. 
Contents c 2005 VIew.; expressed herem represent the majority vote of the editorial board 

and are not necessarllv those of the UC Board of Regent5. the ASUCSD or the members of the 
Guardian staff. 

Service workers should 
approve new contract 

I n the most important measures, the new 
conn'acr offered by the 

University of California 
to its service workers is a 
resounding victory for the 
unIon. 

Despite higher student 
fees next year and micro-
copi c wage increases for 

faCldty, the university has 
offered service workers a 
sizabl e raise - totaling 10 
percent over the next three 
yea rs. And if the governor 
fails to get the Legislature 
to pa s his compact, put-
ting the raises at risk, the 
deal specifically recog-
nizes the right of service 
workers to strike. 

But money aside, the 
contract includes sym-
bolic victories as well. In 
addition to guaranteed 
parking fees aI)d access 
- sure ly our student rep-
resentatives could learn 
a few things from union 
negotiators - the deal 
would provide retroactive 

pay for this year, raise the 
minimum wage for food 
workers and provide for 
paid education leave . 

Though it lacks the 
desired step system backed 
by the umon, the deal is 
surely as good as workers 
call ask for in light of the 
university's current budget 
mess. It IS certainly better 
than the deal the majority 
of the UC community has 
seen in recent years. 

Now, all service work-
ers have to do is vote "yes" 
on the deal, and they cer-
tainly should. Rejecting 
the offer in hope of more 
concessions down the line 
would be both nai've and 
greedy. 

Until 2008, the union's 
current contract with the 
university is as good as it 
can get. And perhaps by 
then we'll have a governor 
who is more amenable to 
providing the university 
with the funds it needs to 
pay truly livable wages. 

Students must decide 
fate of athletic grants 

W ith the recent doubts concerning UCSD's ability to 
secure another waiver from 
the CAA regarding the 
required athletic scholar-
ships for Division II schools 
and the administration's 
subsequent proposal to fund 
these scholarshIps with reg-
istJ'ation fees, the future of 
the UCSD athletics program 
remains uncertain. 

It has consistently been 
the stance of this page that 
expansion of campus-based 
fees - in both amount and 
scope - should be left up 
to the students so as to more 
accurately cater to their 
interests. The best policies 
are those proposed by ancl 
directly voted uron by stu-
dents, because it s ultimately 
the students who are affected 
the most. 

The present situation is 
no different. The university 
should not usc registration 

fee~ to pay for these new ath-
letic scholarships but should 
i l1~teaJ leave it up to the 
tudeJlts to decide, through 

a l>elf-a~~essed acti ity fee, 
whether the well -hel ng of the 

athletics programs is worthy 
of a fee increase. If students 
are willing to foot the bill 
for the scholarships, as the 
recent student satisfaction 
survey would suggest, then 
so be it. But me ~ssibil­
ity that students nught not 
care enough about athletics 
to wan'ant a fee increase is 
reason enough to put it to 
a vote. 

While the "democratic" 
nature of the university's 
proposal- that each student 
athlete will receive approxi-
mately $500 - is com-
mendable, it doesn't address 
the fundamental question of 
whether the plan is needed, 
which is precisely what a 
student self-a sessed activity 
fee is designed to answer. 

It is important that the 
university stay consistent 
in its funding policies. If it 
can't afford to fund ouo'each 
and is intent on letting stu-
dents make tile deci ion for 
themselves, as the student-
initiated outreach referen-
dum illustrated, certainly the 
university shouldn't reverse 
its \) licy on lesser priorities 
sue 1 a ' student athletics.

Expectations 
Carol Freire 

I am haunted by an alphabet soup of plans, and Ira Glass of "This American Life" is to 
blame. In program number 205 he 
opened with a quote from a story by 
the writer Ron Carlson, in which a 
guy loses his job after IO years. His 
boss tells him, "OK, go to Plan B," 
and the guy says, "Ths was Plan B." 
Glass said he thinks this is the way 
it goes for most of us. I am deathly 
afraid he might be right. 

Vocation is one of the most 
daunting decisions for anyone, 
because one's occupation is never 
just a job. Your profession is a core 
part of your identity. It's how you're 
introduced, it's how people remem-
ber you, it keeps you from starv-
ing, and it is looming just beyond 
[''Taduation. It's never "Meet Susan, 
she likes Almodovar movies." It's 
always, "Meet Susan, she's a profes-
sor at UCSD." Perhaps the for-
mer is how i ntroductiolls should be 
done, but they rarely are. In college, 
this pigconholing exists in its proto-
form, by way of major. 

Onc of the IllOSt sa lient charac-
terislics about an acquaintance is 
his or her proposed field of study. 
This si ngular piece of information 
buys you a 1:lL1ndry list of stereo-
typical characteristics, valid or not. 
If you're a chemistry major, we 
assume you are insufferably meticu-
lous, can do mental arithmetic at 
lightning speed and need help writ-
ing anything lengthier than a para -
graph. If you're a literature major, 
you're nOI fit to calcula tc the tip al .l 

restaurant. If, horror of all horrors, 
you're a science and nonscience 
double major, well, let's just say 
you ought to be congratulated for 
overcompensating and hiding your 
intellectual incompetence by sleep-
ing your way through two different 
campus deparonents. 

What if, when we can finally 
control a life-altering choice, we 
screw it up? We have to abandon a 
dream and settle for Plan B. Which 
might fail, and then we'U need Plan 
C, followed by 0, E and F. 

There are no waitresses in 
Hollywood, only struggling actress-
es, and telemarketers don't exist 
- only salesmen. I suppose settling 
doesn't automatically make you 
Willy Loman, but I'm not eager to 
find out firsthand. 

Aristotle said, "Where your tal-
ents and the needs of the world 
cross, there lies your vocation." I 
suppose it's easy to come up with 
pithy quotes when Alexander the 
Great is paying you to do what 
you love, but he may have been on 
to something. I've been thinlcing 
about that quote ever since Andy 
Ceperlcy, our well-spoken Career 
Services Center director, brought 
it to my attention. I've never had a 
clear idea of what I should be, only 
a foggy, hazy intuition. I know very 
clearly what I don't want to do. Like 
Lloyd Dobler, "I don't want to sell 
anything, buy anything or process 
anything as a career. I dOll't want ro 
sell anything bought or procc sed, 
or buy anything sold or processed, 
or proces anything sold, bought or 
processed, or repair anything sold, 
bought or processed." 

I hate selling thinb'S, asking for 
money and itting in fTont of a 
computer from nine to five. I hate 

~randing for eight hours straight, 
punching numbers into lhe ca;h 

register. I once fell asleep filing 
people's oprometry insurance 
paperwork. There usually isn 't a 
box labeled "things you hate" in 
the vocational lest questionnaire. 
I'm faintly aware that I'm probably 
better at biology than any other 
subject. 1 think I li ke challenges, 
fast-paced environments and keep-
ing track of multiple things at once. 
At the same time, I don't think 
a medical school essay explaining 
that I hate lab write-ups, but really 
like dicing things up and sewing 
them back together, would be well-
received. Defining yourself by what 
you don't want to be is approaching 
the problem backwards and has 
left with me the most incongruous 
alphabet soup of plans: B: journal-
ist; C: teacher; 0 : chef; E: failure. 

At least I'm not the only one 
wonderi ng where the crossroad 
between my talent and the world's 
need lies. I have a fi-iend who always 
thought he would be a mathemati-
cian, but saw a below-average math 
GRE score as a wrong-way sign. 
He is going to Boalt Law School 
instead. I have a feeling that vcry 
few of us actually know what their 
calli ng is. A portion of thpsc who ' 
claim to, I suspect, are faking it. 
1'm hoping that in the end, things 
will work out, and if they don 't, it's 
not the end. ''The world seems to 
have an unfortunate excess of bal-
lerinas, firemen and astrona uts, and 
a dearth of talented t ilet cleaners, 
but maybe i~'s all about fi-an-Iing. 
Idealism is for the rich, and mayllC 

,Plan B will evcntll3l1y lead to Plan 
'A. We rarely describe ri'lotl~ ll~ 
a tlItor to a 13-ycar-old brat, and 
often as a philosopher. I g1lcss he 
turned out all right.

THURSDAY. APRIL l8. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Sold-out show right on for nearly-mythical Wilco 
By CLAYTON WORfOLK 

Senior Staff Writer 

W ileo are a rock critic's wet dream: the type of band-in-a-thousand that epito-mizes for its apostles why rock 'n' roll 
is still exciting, why songwriting still matters 
and why the suilS will eventually lose the war 
for pop music. In short, lest you've been living 
in the absence of such characters, the type of 
band that made Yanktt Hotel Foxtrot. 

Yet for all the in)( spilled in support of this 
2002 watershed and its comparably praised 
follow-ups - including excellent side projects 
with Loose Fur and the Minus 5, a feature-
length docwnentary, free fan-friendly EPs, a 
coffee table book and 2004's climactic A Ghost 
Is Born,Wilco remain, to the great delight 
of their enthusiasts, the same hardworking 
travelin' band they were during frontman 
Jeff Tweedy's oft-referenced alt-country days. 
Such diligence-cum-derivativeness-cum-
respect for the art and its fans has, of course, 
only added to this unwitting band's legend 
quotient - which even those who bailed 
from the band's bandwagon long ago are hard 
pressed to argue Wileo don't deserve. 

Some might trace this sentiment baclc to 
1990, the year Tweedy's seminal a1t-country 
band Uncle Tupelo released the genre-refin-

story short) Wileo refused to dumb dOWll 
Yankee Hotel FOXTrot for Warner subsidiary 
label Reprise, bought the rights to the album 
from the label, streamed it free-of-charge on 
the Internet, sold it back to another Warner 
subsidiary - Nonesuch Records - and reaped 
the greatest critical and commercial success of 
their careers. 

Along the way, it should be noted, the 
band has come to represent for many no less 
than the furure of digital music, not in tenns 
of sound (although you11 definitely get that 
when listening to some of the laptop sessions 
on Y InIktt Houl Fortrot or A Ghost Is Born), but 
in tenns of new methodology for connecting 
the artist and the audience. In practice, this 
means releasing records online months before 
their commercial debut and entrusting fans to 
do the right thing (buy it if you like it - if not, 
no hann, no foul); in theory, it means winning 
the praises of cultural critics like Stanford 
law professor Lawrence Lessig, with whom 
Tweedy recendy sat on a panel to discuss 
"Who Owns Culture?" 

NaturalIy, such heroics might be construed 
as mere window dressing, were it not for the 
consistent inteUigence behind Wilco's music. 
Tweedy and his band have evolved in seem-
ingly every way since their casinos-and-DUIs 
1995 debut, A.M., yet Tweedy's stanuner-

ing lyrical chops and 
genre-bending song-
writing remain the 
thread holding Wileo 
together - malcing 
set-list transitions from 
Bting Thtrt screamer 
"Misunderstood" to 
the Woody Guthrie-
penned "California 
S~" to YHF fret-
board-rambler "I'm the 
Man Who Loves You" 
sound nothing short of 
organic. 

ing No fXprorirm. 
Others will ref-
erence Wi leo's 
track record of 
critical acclaim, 
giving the req-
uisite nods to 
1996's Being 
Thtrt and 1999's 
Summer Tttth . 
For most, how-
ever, the roup 
tit gr'flCt was the 
band's new-mil-
lennium tri-

'Hitchhiker's Guide' a screwy, deep-space romp 
that proves the family film is still hunky-dory 

8y CODY NABOURS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Hitchhike r's Guide to the Galaxy" (or "H2G2," as the nerds say) isn ' t just a series of books or radio shows, but 3 
whol e institution of dry British comedy 
that, in the minds of orne . ci-fi fans, is as 
high and mighry as "Monty Python's Flyi ng 
Circus." Douglas Adams, who bega n the 
H2G2 cult with a BBC radio broadcast in 
1978, died in 200 I of a heart attack after 
finishing the second draft of the screenplay, 
which was completed by Karey Kirkpatrick 
("Chicken Run"). The result was a more 
widely-palatable product for Walt Disney 
Pictures to distribute. Adams wholehearted-
ly supported the movie, though he described 
its preproduction as "trying to grill a steak 
by having a succession of people come into 
the room and breathe on it." 

The finished film, however, is untainted 
by the bureaucratic process of its produc-
tion. The result of Kirkpatrick's script-soft-
ening is a tal e thar keeps to rhe spirir of 
Adams' beloved books without fo ll owing the 
story too meticulously. It is enjoyable on 
the same scale of now-aged famil y favorites 
like "The Prince s Bride," "Spaceballs" and 
" Beerlejuice" - hardly ground breaking, but 
thoroughly and eternally sarisfying. 

Added to the original are a central love 
story, which can seem limp, bur is mer-
rily schmal tzy, and an over-the-top President 
of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam 
Rockwell), who is moronic enough for chil -
dren to love, and enough of a Bush mock-
ery to fe tch a chuckle from the rest of us. 
The protagonist, rhe introverted eve ryman 
Arthur Dent (Marrin Freeman, of BBC's 
"The Office"), is as hapless and sympathetic 
as always, while Mos Def lends his own 

Film 
REVI EW 

flair to the idiosyncratic Ford Prefect. Zooey 
Deschanel becomes the lovable - oh, so 
lovable - Disney romanric interest. Alan 
Rickma n lends his voice ro rhis film 's Eeyore, 
M arvin the Pa ra noid Android. and John 
Malkovich pla ys perhaps the film 's most 
restrained character, the created-by- Douglas-
for-the-movie Humma Kavu la. 

Much of rhe book's best humor remai ns 
in the movie, frolll rhe doomed-bur-phil oso-
phizi ng sperm whale (perhaps th e book's fin -
est moment) to the excerpts from the Guide 
itself (sort of the Wikipedi a of the universe). 
Addirionally, the presence of the Infinite 
Improbability Drive (where anything pos-
sible can and will occur) allows for extremely 
random happenings, si mil ar in style to the 
"Family Guy" shrick. 

Alter yea rs of rumors, rhere fin all y is a 
"Hitchhiker's Guide to rhe Galaxy" movie, 
and it stands alone not as a pal e shadow of 
the book, but as its own colorful story. It IS 
undoubtedly a Disney version of the famou~ 
tale, but still a fine exampl e of (usually-oor-

I avid DuchOVDy has an imponant story to tell. It's a story of turning 13 years 
old and becoming a man in the gritty 

New York City of 1973, of joy and heart-
break and life-long secrets. Duchovny 
wants his st~ to be life-mflirming, laugh-

to like aU of his chanc:ten. (As with most

D : Well, he knew firsthand what things

shot "Raging Bull." So I thought, you 
know, It the bare minimum my film 's 
going to look OK. 

G: Last night, at the public scree/ling, 
some crazy lady asked a question about 
your use of cigarettes in the film , and if 
you were getting money for the product 
placement. But in the film, the cigarettes 
spend most of the time in the toilet and 
Anton Yelchin pees on them .. . 

D : Oh, well there was no product place-
ment in this lDOYie. I'm not above taking 
money from a cigarette company to make 
my movie, but they didn't offer! But the ciga-
rette butt imagery was just something that I 
remembered from being a kid, and we lived 
in an apartment with one bathroom, ami my 
mom would toss her cigarette butts in the 
tDiIet. And then I'd go pee, and I'd try to 
brak them apart with my srream. And [ just 
thought, well r haven't seen thar in a movie, 
and it felt like it was his unt!~'Pressed hosti lity 
towvd his mother. You know, he's in this 
relationship with his mom and he can't push 
her away, but he can pee on her (.igarcttc

British Sea Power 
Open Season 
Rough Trade 

**** 

The laSt four times I've listened to this album, I've fallen asleep, and 
I can't explain why. The 
same thing happens with 
the band's last album, The 
Drdinr of 8,i/ish Sea Pawn', 
which rocks decidedly much 
harder - at least the part 
that [ remember hearing 
before the Sandman sets in. 

When Open Season 
begins with "It Ended on 
an Oily Stage," it's as if 
the band has just come out 
of the rai ny Brighton dusk 
(requisite milita ry uniforms 

covered in beads of collect-
ed precipitation), plugged in 
its instrumenrs and played 
the local pub as if it were 
Wembly Arena . Unlike 
most hands that have raken 
steps away from their post-
punk idol with their fol -
lowing al bums , British Sea 
Power continue to sound 
as real as if they were play-
ing a few feet from you, in 
a thatched roof tavern or 
a sour-smelling pWlk dive. 
They've not gonen our of 
their Joy Division stage 
and have taken some les-
sons in precious twee-pop 
from Belle & Sebastian. 
Singer Yan sounds like 
Springsteen channeling Ian 
Curtis in a crooning con-
test. While softer songs 
alternate with louder ones, 
the music is hypnotizing, 
like the embodiment of 
three generations of Bri t 
pop in a band that doesn' t 
care whether it rocks your 
fucking socks off or sends 
you to sleep. And, frankly, 
nei ther do I. 

British Sea Power will 
perform at the Casbah 
May 3.

Fat Possum 

Thir is what all you semi-teenage, garage-inhabiting, ex-punker, 
blues-discovering, shaggy, 
a t-h o me -or-i n -co ll ege, 
Zep-freaked , Nirvana-wor-
shipping, naive-and -slight-
Iy-dirty waiters/baristas 
and bookstore employees 
need to realize: If you 
want to play simple-ass 
garage/punk/stoner or oth-
erwise-mostly-three-chord 
rock - and you don 't want 
to suck - you need to 
make every single god-
dam n instrument count. 

Every singlr one. 
See: Heartless Bastards, 

St(/in l/1ul Eleva/on. 
Singer/guitarist Erika 
Wennerstrom commands 
a vocal tone equivalent to 
a l 2-gauge shotgun: Like 
the burly beauty of t he 
Les Paul that accompanies 
it, her thick crowing ever 
penetrates to the frOnt of 
the song, growing more 
nuanced as -it gets louder. 

Wennerstrom can 
also write a hell of a song 
- and she's got a band 
that can both throw down 
and disappear when it's 
time, which slife helps 
those bare three-chorders 
stand out from the pack 
of shit-mitators. Starting 
with her rambling, intro-
spective lyrics, and the 
drone-y growl of her 'Paul, 
drummer Kevin Vaughn 
and bassist Mike Lamping 
build up hard-hitting but 
crafty. muscle-car rhythms. 
So disarmingly mortal 
(all Converse-d whipper-
snapper- hipsters better 
recognize), the Heartless 
Bastards keep it simple way 
better than your band.

Gorilla! 
Demon Days 

Virgin 

**** G orillaz were supposed to be a joke: the ulti -mate contrived pop 
band and a private laugh 
for Blur frontman Damon 
AJbarn. So what happens 
when the little joke gets 
out of hand and sells more 
copies than his last "seri-
ous" Blur album? The 
answer is Demon Days, a 
surprisingly serious take 
on the typical zombie 
movie pop music that 
Gorillaz noodled around 
with on their previous 
self-titled rel ease . With 
a more stri pped-down, 

demo- like feci, Drmon 
Days allows Ibarn to let 
100 e with so me impres-
sive musical composition 
while si ngin g the s'llne 
nonsense lyrics abour 
monster movies and pol ~ 
lution. 

Building on the suc-
cess of the offbeat rap 
track "Clint Eastwood" 
from the self-titled disc, 
Demon Doys includes no 
less than five ste ll ar hip-
hop tracks, fea turing the 
likes of Pharcyde, D e 
La Soul and MF Doom 
(whose flow includes the 
hilarious line " Bzzzt! I'm 
a rapper bug zapper") . 
The end of Demon Days is 
something e lse altogether; 
after an incredible apoca-
lyptic spoken-word piece 
by Dennis Hopper enti-
tled " Fire Coming Out 
of the Monkey's Head," 
the album slides into what 
can only be described as 
a gospel-fueled take on 
the end of t he Beatles ' 
"Abbey Road." It 's a lit-
tle uneven for a theme 
record , bur every sing le 
track is excell ent.

·Duchovny: 
Saine chances 

have to be taken 
for impact 

continued from paRe 7 
- image at till! end, and make it very 

emotional. Ami I was asked last night, 
was that product placement and why 
was everybody smoki ng, and was I 
promoting moking, and I said that 
I don't think I would get money for 
product placement to then urinate on 
the product. You know, here's a can 
of Coke, and now I'm going to take a 
dump on it. 

G: A lot of people think they 
k.now the formula for h umor, bur 
entimentality in a film is much 

harder to pull off like you did in 
this film . What's your secret for 
pulling the heartstrings without 
making it look trite' 

0 : I don't know, it's like an 
instinct. I really wanted to make 
a movie ... [where] you sat in the 
theater and really went through an 
emotional journey with these char-
acters. And YOll can't do that unle s 
you take the chance of crossing the 
line, because you can't take it far 
without taking the chance of push-
ing it tOO far. And I'm sure for some 
people, you know, I fully e,xpect 
some people to say it's sc hm altz}' or 
something, but everybody's entItl ed 
to their opinion. You know, ['d be 
disappointed if some people didn't, 
because I think that different peo-
ple have di fferent levels of comfort 
with emotio n . It's like a litmus 
test of the person: "I don't like to 
sit there and feel that, and [ don't 
\,'ant to." But the way I thought to 
combat it [was], the more specific 
you make it the more real it seems 
and the less manipulative it seems. 
I t seems more like a tory and less 
like I'm just trying to get you ri ght 
now , you know, because ['m not 
trying to "get" anybody, I'm just 
trying to tell mis story for these 
characters. 

G: OK, being the college paper 
I've got to throw something odd at 
you. My g irlfriend used to listen 
to a lot of novelty reco rds, and [ 
wanted to know ... do you have an 
official response to Bree Sharp, for 
her song, "Why Don't You Love 
Me, David Duchovny'" that was 
made back when you we re on "x-
Files"? 

0 : 0aughing} I want to hear, you 
know, the next song from Bree. r 
thought it was pretty catchy. And 
Illy wife, she was jealollS that [ didn't 
write a song for her, nobody wrote a 
song for her, so I came up with the 
song "Why Don't You Blow Me, Tea 
Leoni?" I guess that's the sequel. But 
that's never been aired. 

G: Do you have any advice for 
up-and-i:orning filmmakers, how to 
get their first feature off the ground? 
I knew you went through a lot to get 
this going. 

D: Yeah, I think so, and you 
know r had certain advantages mat 
are built in, [but] I recognize that 
it's hard. But I think that, wim the 
state of technology the way it is 
now .. . you don't need Hollywood . 
You can make a movie for $10,000. 
It's all in the writing. You've got to 
write the stories, you've got to make 
the movie. So, you could try to go 
the .Hollywood route, where the 
odds are agai nst you hecatlse there 
aren 't mat m any movies made, and 
it's hard to do. But if you're dead-
set on making a film, a;ld that's not 
working for you, I don't see that 
there' any rea on to tOp . You call 
cast it, becau e there arc plellty of 
actors mat want to work. You can 
make film. That's why I say YOll 
h uld.

THE ANNUAL ROBERT C. ELLIOTI MEMORIAL LECTURE 

Amy Kaplan 
Graduate Chair, Department of English 
University of Pennsylvania 

"Where is 
Guantanamo?" 

Thursday, April 28, 2005, 7:30 pm 
UCSD - Pepper Canyon Hall 109 

"Guantanamo" evokes shocking images of shackled prisoners in orange 
jumpsuits, forced to their knees, their hooded heads held to the dirt, 
confined by barbed wired and hulking U.s. soldiers. But the place itself, 
the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is chillingly appropriate. 
Why Cuba, so close geographically but so far politically, a country the 
U.S. refuses to recognize? How did Guantanamo become a " legal back 
hole," a space for a brutal prison in a perpetual war against terror? Is 
Guant.1namo in Cu ba or the U.S.? Who is sovereign there? 
Amy Kaplan, who received her Ph.D. from The Johns Hopkins University, 
works in the interdisciplinary field of American studies. Guantanamo, 
she argues, lies at the heart of the U.S. Empire, and the legal status and 
treatment of the prisoners there must be understood in the light of the 
long imperial history of this place. Her most recent book is TIle AllarcllY 
of Empire in the Making of u.s. Culture.

having tried to move up a few picks 
to grab either wide receiver Mark 
Clayton of Oklahoma or Roddy 
White of Univer ity of Alabama 
Birmingham, either of whom seems 
more prepared ro contribute in an 
immediate fashion. In the end , the 
Chargers and their growing legion

success. This team seems headed on 
a path toward embodying their role 
not just as the Chargers, but the Sa n

SPORTS THURSDAY APRil 28, 2005 12 
Superior Triton student,athletes honored for academic excellence 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD athletes juggling the rig-
ors of academics and the demands of 
their sporr were rewarded on April 
21 when the UCSD Deparrment of 
lntercollegiate Athletics honored 11 
of irs athletes on National Student-
Athlete Day for their academic and 
athletic accomplishmenrs. 

"These student-athletes typify 
the standards that have been set 
here at UCSD," Athletic Director 
Earl W Edwards said. "Our proud 
tradition of academic and athletic 
excellence is only furthered by the 
accomplishmenrs of these selected 
few who are only a sampling of 
the extraordinary young men and 
women that represent this world-
class insti nltion on a daily basis." 

This is a yearly event honoring 

athletes from the six different colleg-
es. Among tho e in anendance were 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Warson, A.S. President 
Chris Sweeten and Edwards. 

Besides srudying for classes, 
athletes also study game film and 
corrurut plays to memory - a chal-
lenging task according to Associate 
Athletics Director and Compliance 
Officer Wendy Taylor May. 

"You study these things because 
you know you represent the univer-
sity, your teammates and coaches, 
as well as all those who have gone 
before and worn the uniform," 
Taylor May said. "And when the 
tesrs come, you face the public with 
your grades, for all to see, and you 
pass with flying colors or you go 
back and work harder the next time. 
You do this because you represent 
more than just the individual, you

are a college student-athlete and you 
represent UCSD." 

The ational Student-Athlete 
awards went to junior Michelle 
DiMeo from cross country and track 
and field, senior Shlomo Lip.etz from 
baseball, senior Jessica Wong from 
water polo, junior Niki Anderson 
from softball, sophomore Emily 
Harlan from swimming, senior 
Benjamin Wang from crew, seniors 
Bryan Swan and Jasmin Dao from 
tennis, sophomore Brett Maurer and 
junior Matthew Davey from soccer 
and junior Bret Martin from fenc-
ing. 

Following the awards ceremony, 
Swatt addressed the audience, shar-
ing his experiences as a student-ath-
lete at UCSD, which have allowed 
him and other athletes to contribute 
to the UCSD and local community. 

"As athletes, we are in the unique

position of being representative 
of the school ," Swan said. "From 
coundess volunteer projects to lead-
ership groups, many of us constandy 
work toward improving UCSD's 
reputation by giving back both to 
the university and to our neighbors 
in San Diego." 

Swatt also credited the coach-
es and the UCSD Department of 
Intercollegiate Athletics with empha-
sizing the importance of academics. 

"Sporrs teach many valuable les-
sons not learned in the classroom," 
he said. "Supporting an even stron-
ger and more dynamic athletic pro-
gram allows for a different kind of 
learning. Sporrsmanship, team play 
and discipline are all lile skills that 
can be learned on the field. The 
athletic department does a tremen-
dous job in instilling these qualities 
in its players and it is no coincidence

Excitement starts early 
for fans of NFL Draft 
cup 0' 

FL Draft 2005 has come 
and gone. For most, it's an 
event that is ... well, it's not 

really much of an event at all. But 
for sports fans, true sports fans, the 
NFL draft is a day of excitement, 
intrigue and ultimate possibility. 
Draft day is for the purists, the elit-
ists. It's for those fans who still 
cringe when they hear the name 
Tony Mandarich, the offensive 
tackle who the Packers selected sec-
ond overall in 1989 before the likes 
of legendary Lions running back 
Barry Sanders and "Primetime" 
Deion Sanders. It's for those fans 
who still have, who still look at and 
who still regret buying the jersey of 
- shudder - Ryan Leaf. 

Since the draft is far too exhaust-
ing to be covered fully within one 
article, I will instead place the focus 
upon the same team that selected 
Leaf second overall in 1998, hoping 
the quarterback from Washington 
State would be a franchise player, 
and not the freaking pissant he 
became. I turn away from mistakes 
of the past and look with hope 
toward the future of the San Diego 
Chargers. 

The Chargers made a miracu-
lous ascension last year, going from 
the number-one pick in the draft as 
a result of their league-worst 4-12 
record to making the playoffs and 
winning the Me West division with 
their startling 12 -4 record. Going 
into the draft this year, things were 
different in San Diego than they 
had been for many yean. No longer 
was there I tam faced with desper-
ate needs at numerous positions. 
Instead, the Chargers were a tam 
with the luxury of simply filling in 
a few holes and adding depth to an 
already-solid team. 

The Chargers sat calmly dur-
ing the fint round, not using the 
two picb they had - one IS a 
result of the past year's Draft Day 

trade of quarterback Eli Manning 
to the New York Giants - to try 
to trade up any further than their 
already-strong sta ndings with the 
12th and 28th picks. The team 
selected pass-rushing defensive end 
Shawn Merriman out of Maryland, 
acquiring a player who would fit 
well within the team's 3-4 defensive 
scheme and who could immedi-
ately improve one of the team's 
weaknesses in putting pressure on 
opposing quarterbacks. With the 
28th pick, the Chargers selected 
defensive tackle Luis Castillo from 
Northwestern. Some suspected that 
Castillo would fall our of the first 
round due to revelations that he had 
used an illegal substance in an effort 
to quicken his recovery from an 
elbow injury. However, there is no 
denying that Castillo's talent is wor-
thy of a first-round choice, and his 
addition brings further aggression 
to the Chargers' defensive line. 

In the second round, the 
Chargers were able to address their 
need at wide receiver. With the 29th 
pick in the round, the Chargers 
selected wide receiver Vincent 
Jackson out of Northern Colorado. 
Jackson, at 6 feet, 5 inches and 230 
pounds, will develop into a huge 
target for quarterback Drew Brees 
(or possibly last year's first-round 
pick quarterback Philip Rivers), and 
is blessed with exceptional speed for 
his size that should further help the 
Chargers in years to come. 

Without a pick in the third 
round, the Chargers sat idle until 
the fourth round, when they used 
the 130th overall selection on speedy 
Kansas State runningback Darren 
Sproules. Sproules was looked upon 
as lacking the size and build to be 
a future NFL runningback. The 
Chargers, however, already with 
superstar runningback LaDainian 
Tomlinson and strong hick-ups in 
Jesse Chatman and third-stringer 
Michael '11te Burner" Turner, will 
be able to utilize Sproules' speed 
and versatility, filling a need for 
I kick returner and also adding 
another pw-catching weapon from 
the runningbac:k slot.
