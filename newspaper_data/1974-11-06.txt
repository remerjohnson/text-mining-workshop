Massive Republican 

Defeats 
by J~mes G. Soto 

Edmund C . Brown, Jr. defeated 
Houston I. Flournoy yesterday in 
the California gubernatorial race, 
following a Democratic landslide 
throughout the nation. 

Brown was leading Flournoy 
last night at press time, though 
the margin of victory was not as 
great as expected . Flournoy, at 
one point in the evening, was 
lead i ng Brown, but the 
Democratic Secretary of State 
managed to maintain a steady 
flow of support through the entire 
state. 

In California, the Democratic 
lands I ide was not as strong as the 
rest of the nation , as Republ icans 
polled some mild surprises. 

Controller 
Republican William Bagley was 

leadi ng Democrat Ken Cory in the 
State Controller' s race . 
Republican John Kehoe was 
running surprisingly strong 
against former Speaker of the 
Assembly Jess Unruh in the 
Treasurer's race. However, the 

race did not indicate a winner at Local Races The change, in the form of an ammendment to the Coop's con-
stitution and operating procedures, will require that the BRG be 
composed of two students elected from each college, plus two at large 
representatives ana a coordinator elected by the Coop. The am-
mendment, proposed by David Cassidy as a compromise to a motion 
by Montgomery Reed, which would have imposed a quota system on 
the budget committee, was passed by a vote of 30 to 11 .

March K. Fong was elected ~ as Bob Wilson defeated Coleen 

Secretary of State over Brian Van O'Connor by ' a slim margin. 
Camp by a wide margin. Evelle Wilson told the Triton Times , 

Edmund G. Brown, Jr. 
Younger and Alan 6anston easily 
won reelection in their respective 
races for Attorney General and 
U.S. Senate. 

I n the closest race of the 
evening John Harmer and Mervyn 
Dymally traded the lead in the Lt . 
Governor's race. The results may 
not be known until this af-
ternool'l . 

" Although I was disappointed 
with the results of the national 
election, I feel that President Ford 
will be able to work with the new 
Congress ." Wilson was also 
surprised by the news that he is 
now the ranking Republican on 
the House Arms Services Com-
mittee. The two senior 
Republicans on the committee 
were defeated last night. 

Jim Bates easily defeated Jim 
Bear in the Fourth Supervisorial 
District in the only local race 
where an incumbant was 
defeated. Leslie Gehres, county 
Republican chairman, said he 
wasn't surprised by the results, 
though he expected Mike 
Bollman to defeat Bob Wilson in 
the 77th Assembly race. Wilson 

Reed's motion, which was defeated last week, was allowed 
reconsideration Monday because he submitted it to be considered 
point-by-point rather than as a whole. The intent of the motion, he 
said, was to eliminate the discrimination implicit in the Coop proposal 
as or/'ginally drafted. 

The present members of the BRG, whose recommendations for the 
funding of program budgets were approved last week, were not 
elected .

CALPIRG (California Public 

Interest Research Group) is 
starti ng work on two major 
projects in the areas of ad-
vertising fraud and open spaces . 

Steve Colman 
OpenSpues 

According to Steve Brault, 
UCSD graduate and CALPIRC 
aide, the Open Spaces project 
will be the most intensive, long-
range project that CALPIRG has 
attempted, extending over the 
entire school year. "This project is 
going to topple the Planning 
CommiSSion," he added . The 
intent of the project is to draw up 
a proposal that will determine 
whether open spaces are being 
preserved in the county, and 
restructure and redefine the tasks 
of the county's Planning Com-
mission . • 

-At present, the seven-member 
commission, which is responsible 
for zoning, reaulating growth and 
setting aside open spaces in the 
county is, said Brault, "made up 
of either developers or major land 
owners and is stAcked in favor of 
the development industry." 
CAlPIRC feels that open spaces is 
one of the most crucial issues for 

the coming two decades. Brault 
added, "Once you grade down 
and pave over the land, you'll 
never sprout anything ." 

CALPIRG plam to set up task 
forces in three major areas : to 
determine if the open spaces plan 
for the county complies with 
state laws, to investigate conflicts 
of interest on the Planning 
Commission and to draw up a 
plan to have property taxed at its 
current use. 

An "informant" on the com-
mission sympathetic to 
CALPIRC's cause has agreed to 
give CALPIRG information and 
advice on the project. The project 
wili be guided by Bob Fellmeth, 
aide to Ralph Nader and an expert 
on land use in California. 
CALPIRG needs students to do 
research and interviewing for the 
project, for which they will 
receive course credit in Political 
Science or URS. 

Consumer Protection 
I n the area of consumer 

protection, CALPIRG plans to 
tackle advertising fraud . The 
project was initiated in response 
to complaints that various local 
stores don't supply items which 
have been advertised " on 
special ." According to Steve 
Colman, CALPIRG co-ordinator at 
UCSO, the practice of advertising 
sale prices on items that have 
been deliberately under~rdered 
is illegal. The result of this project 
will be to publish the names of 
stores that violate the law on a 
regular basis. 

CALPIRC plans to use a t~ 
force of twenty to twenty-five 
students who would check the 
newspapers for ~ecials, then 

survey of quantity of sale items 
in the stores . Any student in-
terested in working on either of 
these projects should stop by the 
CALPIRG office in the Student 
Center. 

Coordinators for academic affairs will be Lincoln Cushing, an editor 
of CAPE, and Dayrl Fanberg, who is the local annex director of the UC 
Student Lobby. The coordinator for the Committee on Appointments 
and Evaluations is Steve Lopez. 

Tskubo from UCSD? 

For Better Education in Japan 
by Mark Woelber 

A few years ago, a group of Japanese educators 
toured the world examining the campuses of 
various universities, including UCSD. They 
collected ideas and information that they in-
tended to use in the implementation of a new 
form of university system in Japan. They took their 
ideas back to Japan and developed a plan for the 
'university of the future.' 

In the intervening years, the plan of this 
university, known as Tsukuba, has become one of 
the biggest political issues in Japan. 

Reversal 
The plan, as it exists, is a deliberate reversal of 

many of the sacred traditions of the Japanese 
educational structure. Reverance is a fundamental 
element of the old system, with such practices as 
unlimited, unqualified tenure, and a high degree 
of disciplinary parochialism. Coupled with the 
seemingly unresolvable and sometimes violent 
student unrest on Japanese campuses, the 
political implicatiom became significant. 
Planning for the new university continued, 
onstruction in the town of Tsukuba, was 

initiated, and the first class began ItS studies. 
Recently, Vice-chancellor for Academic Affairs, 

Paul Saltman was invited to speak at a conference 
of Japanese educators, during which he was 
shown the plan for Tsukuba. He found that the 
new university, conceptually, ideologically, and 
rhysically, was a near-replica of UCSD. 

EnthusUllm 

high in many sectors of industry and government. 
There has-n't been a new universi ty in Japan for 
over 150 years, and changes are overdue. 

Saltman's speech was titled "The Structure and 
Function of a University ... Reform at the 
University of California." Significant pOints, as 
they relate to Tsukuba U. cvncerned the role that 
the actual physical plan of the school has on the 
learning and social processes. For example, the 
problems the UC ystem faced follOWing the Free 
p ech Movement and tudent unrest In the 
ixties were essentially ameliorated on the UCSD 

Reverence is a fundamentsl 
element of the old system, 
with such practices as 
unlimited, unqualified tenure, 
and a high degree of 
disciplinary parochialism.

Ford's Trip To Mexico: An Incident 
f¥''''"",L''''_L''''' DE KINO, Mex.-For a number of 

the most memorable moment 
of Ford's rushed visit to Mexico was an 
incicietlt on a bus. 0., the surface, the incident, which involved 
sorn~: angry shouting at a Mexican by a White 
Hou-le official, may seem trivial. But it tells far 
more about the problems of relations between the 
l.Inited States and Mexico than all the abrazos, 
flowery speeches, cheering and platitudinous toasts 
that embellished the meetings of Presidepts Ford 
and Luis Echeverria of Mexico on the border. 

After the two preSidents met here in this antique 
and small Mexican town, they rushed to helicopters 
that would carry them to another meeting in 
Arizona. American and Mexican newsmen were 
assigned to helicopters for the trip as well. 

Because of a mixup in logistics, a White House 
official in charge of a small group of regular White 
House correspondents could not find the bus 
assigned to take them to their helicopter. So the 
official led the correspondents aboard a Mexican 
bus which wa.s to carry Mexican journalists to their 
helicopters . I was the only American journalist on 
the bus and was an pyewitness to what followed. 

It is hard for an outsider to imagine, but there is 
almost a mania in the White House press corps for 
reaching the President's destination about the same 
time that he does. ft is an essential part of their job . 
The White House offical reflected this near mania . 
He knew that the U.S. Army helicopters would not 
wait if the correspondents failed to show up on 
time. He panicked . 

The White House oHicial ordered the Mexican 
bus driver to proceed at once. But the bus was in 
the charge of a young woman from the office of the 
Mexican president. She was waiting for several 
more Mexican journalists. She also knew that the 
Mexican government helicopters, unlike the U.S. 
Army helicopters, would not take off until the 
Mexican journalists were aboard . So she told the 
White House official that the bus would have to 
wait for the rest of the Mexican journalists to show 
up . 

This drove the White House official into a rage. 
He screamed, waved his arms frantically, and 
shouted obscenities at the Mexican woman . He 
again ordered the Mexican bus driver to drive on . 
When the driver refused, the official turned on the 

\ woman . " I will report you to the President," he 
r promised-but did not say which president he had in 

mind. 

HIS shouting and cursina became so offensive 
that the incident almost turned even more ugly. 
Some Mexican jownalists got up from their seats-
not only was the American official insultina a 
Mexican but he was insulting a woman. A fistfight 
might have erupted. 

But the White House official finally gave up, 
jumped down from the bus and stopped an am-
bulance moving past. The driver of the Mexican 
amDulance agreed to take him and his White House 
correspondents to the airfield . They reached the 
helicopters just in time. 

The incident may have been an isolated one, but 
it probably was not . Instead, it seemed to reflect· 
how American officials and other Americans take 
Mexico and Mexicans for granted. The official was 
merely act1ng the way he might have if there were a 
logistics foulup in Arizona. It is hard to imagine, 
however, that the official would have behaved the 
same way if the incident had occurred on a 
presidential trip to France. The official would not 
have tried to commandeer a French bus and then 
shout at a French official, male or female, who tried 
to stop him . 

The episode also seemed to reflect a lack of 
awareness among American officialdom about the 
sensibility of Mexicans. Although the United States 
and Mexico do have generally good relations, most 
Mexicans know their history . It is a history filled 
with a series of humiliations at the hands of 
Americans, starting with the Mexican War that took 
so much of what is now the Southwestern United 
States, including California, from Mexico . The 
press, journals and books of Mexico continually 
dwell on the historical intrusions of the United 
States into their country and on the present ten-
tacles of the United States on the economy of 
Mexico . 

In a situation like this, American officials, 
especially on a goodwill visit, ought to be in-
structed to guard themselves very carefully against 
offending Mexicans. 

After the incident, the behavior of the American 
became a major topic of discussion among Mexican 
journalists, who have long looked on the young 
Mexican woman as an efficient , helpful and 
friendly official. Although only 20 Mexican jour-
nalists were on the bus, it was hard to find a 
journalist later who did not know the story and did 
not sound indignant. 

" I suppose," said a Mexican magazine writer, 
"that Insolence is a sign of development ." He did 
not mean his bitter joke to be funny.

San Diego Airport Plans 
I n recent months I have been 

reading about the wheres and 
whens of the relocation of Lind-
berg Field and the proposed 
takeover of Miramar Air Station 
by the City of San Diego. 

To begin with, why do we need 
a big super major airport in San 
Diego? We talk about rapid 
transit, and to the city's credit, 
now have mini-buses for outlying 
districts . Why don't San Diego 
and Los Angeles develop a joint 
major airport? Then, smaller jets 
can use Lindberg Field. 

I would like the Triton Times, 
when Mayor Pete Wilson and 
Chancellor McElroy meet 
Wednesday, to find out thf 

mayQf's point of view and how 
Mcelroy feels about a major 
airport east of UCSD and with a 
fl ight path directly over the 
school. 

What about the safety of this 
university? The jets at Miramar 
are much more manuverable than 
any big airliners that would be 
flying over UCSD if a commercial 
airport is built at Miramar. 

Now is the time for all here at 
UCSD to voice their opinions and 
not wait until after something 
happens . 

By the way, the City may ask 
Congress for control of Miramar. I 
hope this will not take place .

the dudes in charge came up to 
the guys sitting next to me and 
demanded they surrender their 
seats. You see, the traveling press, 
from the news magazines, was 
coming in with Jackson and 
needed a place to sit . Well, the 
guys next to me, who were fairly 
distinguished looking and seemed 

had cameras there . That night, of 
course, I missed seeing myself on 
39 news. 

Jackson's press secretary 
passed out press releases full of 
Scoop's deathless quotes and 
scathing denunciations of thE' 
Republican administration . 

Then Jackson came in, 

fI~atives of the MIA's confronted 
Jackson and demanded action for 
those left in Vietman . While this 
was happening a few reporters 
asked O'Connor about her 
alleg~d involvement with Jane 
Fonda . She blew her cool and told 
one of them off. 

That's one of the subtler dif-

Jackson and O 'Connor went on 
to their luncheon , that the San 
Diego Democratic party cheaply 
wouldn't let me into, and I took 

my authentic blue reporter's 
notebook and left to convince the 
city editor to reimburse me for 
parking and gas. 

I was all set for my first hQf)e.st 
press conference. I took my 
authentic blue reporter's 
notebook and piled off to the U.S. 
Crant Hotel to involve myself in 
this grand political tradition . 

Scoop Jackson was in town . 
Since he's "the leading contender 
for the Democratic presidential 
nomination", as Colleen 
O'Conner was to introduce him, 
he was hot news and all us 
working press came out for . the 
event . Of course the free lun-
cheon may have had something 
to do with it. 

Jackson and 0 'Conno, went on to the/, luncheons, that the 
San Diego Democ,atlc Party cheaply wouldn't let me Into, 
and I took my authentic blue I'fIporte,'s notebook and left to 
conv;nce the city edlto, to reimburse me fo, parking and gas. 

The only problem is that to get 
to the Grant Hotel you have to go 
through Horton Plaza. I scurried 
past the toughs and idled through 
the girl ie newspaper stands , 
arriving safely at the hotel. 

Once I made it to the Georgian 
Room I grabbed a seat with the 
other "pros" and thought my 
problems were over. Then one of 

to belong, didn't want to leave. 
I then expected this person to 

ask me to move . He didn 't . By 
then I was convinced it was the 
notebook and clutched it 
protectively. 

Cradually my heart stopped 
pounding and I started feeling 
involved in the general scheme of 
things. I looked around at the rest 
of the people. What amazed me 
were all the old folks . They must 
have been wealthy La Jolla 
contributors . I didn 't know there 
were any Democrats in La Jolla .

highlighted by the almost 
universal collapse of the 
Republican party . Though all the 
returns were not avai lable at press 
time, Democrats had managed to 
sweep the House races , the 
gubernatorial races , and made 
signifigant gains in the Senate, 
where they were held back only 
by the paucity of Republican 
seats up for grabs . 

When the final returns are in, it 
is expected the Democrats wi II 
control nearly 300 seats. Most 
Rf'publican losses appear to be in 
the Midwest and in New England . 

Javits Holds On 
In the Senate, Democrats 

picked up formerly Republican 
seats in Kentucky, Florida , and 
Colorddo. Republicans managed 
to hold on to their seat in New 
York where Jacob Javits easily 

turned away the chall enge of 
Democrat Ramse y Clark a nd

"growth of a mtJnity spirit' " 
J" a. awesome display of"uuDer,~ Coop meets every Monday nighl. In 

these meetl;,gs a "ew generation has emerged. The hales, tensions 
anti dislrtlsts of the olllside been thT'llst aside in a" aura of 
"awareness". Ellery ",ghtthere 01 goodwIll ge"tly wafti"g through . 
Ihe meeti"g room. E"eryo"e feels are reached: Nirvana is at 
hand. 

Last Monday "ight the Coop _"'.,., /V' to bn'ng concerned students 
together in an effort to promote ' community spin'/ -- a "ew sense 
ofUC5D student awareness and the Coop proposal], everyone was 
&ertainly aware of its IInif:yi"g 

YOII &ould se"se it in MO'nil:!'om'.... proposal to i"elude a member of 
e"ery special i"terest group Resources Group. to halt special 
i"terest group co"trol of the lunds. You could hear il in Tom 
Leanse 's questio"s 01 coordi"ate You could feel it in David Cassidy's 
IT'IIsl olthe BRG. The power was kee"ly aware of its stable, 
close rapport with all who were entire meeting was an exercise in 
getling along, i" gelh'ng close to in working together. 

50? T haven 'I made any real who didn't go 10 Ihe meeting lor 
maybe those who were there) . As clanjication, the draft of my in-
terpretation of the co"frontation , was that it [and the Coop in 
general] was a power structure, 01 white males [and a couple of ' 
females) who wrote up the . off against groups of people 
of color and van'ous assorted concerns who felt BRG was not 
rep'resentative, and thus didn't ' their budgets, and that il could 
never do so. 

There is mmitment 
Basically the whole group is o/Jou'. e as cats and dogs and just about as 

eloquent in thelT handling o[ community seems incapable (jf 
operation as a community . No o1le to Cooplerate) about anythi"g . 
A large number 01 the Coop themselves from any sense o[ 
community, from the spin't o[ the their strong associations with their 
own special interests. They come 10 as special interest group members, 
not as Coop members with specia 

The students who are into studen are just that. They are dealing with 
the Coop with an ASB mentality. a new form 01 student government 
in name only. As radical artd vvv,--.." power structure may [eel in. their 
souls, they [for the most part] are ' every part of Coop business as a 

-student government problem .. problem. There is no com· 
mitment to community. 

So? I am trying to say things in 
pretty ragged. Our expen'ment irl 
here ? 

Probably not. 

and in the Coop as a whole are 
is lading . Can I have any purpose 

I am asking the impossible. BII' Coop. 
- Can I reasonably expect Kirk to look at things from Montgomery 

Reed's position, and only then to m. ClSloinsfor the good of the Coop, and 
vice versa? Can any of the people 's note here -- it came up in a 
Coop meeting thai use of Ihe " was insensitive. J Tn a sincere 
personal effort not 10 offend use the term ' 'people of color ", 
which seems to be the "ague the Coop meetings. If I am in error, I 
would appreciate someone out on such things ever feel at ease 
with any group making which they are not physically 
represented? Can I expect a . less than 100 students to get 
together once a wed and have good in mind when deciding 
anything ? Can I expect this through at least 20 years of living 
in this consciousness lorming . understanding and trust? 

I suppose I could expect il. But be disappointed just as the Coop 
has been disappointed. No I expect too much. I'll just have to 
suffer with my dream of Coop just hasn 'I got ittogelher enough 
to pull it off 

Too bad.

European Hand .. ball • • Where -is it? 

Out of the Ordinary 
There were 55 seconds remaining in the game. The Chargers had just 

taken the lead, 36-35, on a forty yard field goal by Ray Wersching. I was 
already dreaming of how I was going to write up (he Chargers first 
home victory. 

Then I saw my dream begin to shatter before my eyes. 
Greg Pruitt, you remember him, he was the one who made the Wish-

bone famous at Oklahoma, then returned the kickoff some 61 yards to 
the Charger thirty yard line. I thought for sure that home town hero 
Brian Sipe (ex of San Diego State) had guided his Cleveland team to its 
third victory of the year. He had taken the Browns from the thirty down 
to the ten . All that remained was for Sipe to take the snap from center, 
lie down on the ball, let the clock run down to about 2 seconds, have 
Don Cockroft come in and kick a chip shot field goal to take the 
victory out of the Chargers grasp. 

It was not to be so. If you listen to Sipe, center Bob DeMarco, or 
Charger defensive tackle Bob Brown, you would think that each of 
them was solely responsible for the. fumble that occurred on the next 
play. Sipe, in taking the snap from center never found the handle . 
Charles Anthony of the Chargers did, preserving the win, the first this 
season at home for the Chargers 

Anyway, Brown thought he hit DeMarco hard enough .while 
D~Marco still had some control over the ball. DeMarco thought It was 
a bad snap. Sipe thought he was too anxious to get th ball. Oh well, 
what does it matter? Somewhere in there, someone fumbled and the 
Chargers came out with the ball and a victory . 

One had to. figur or feel that something was amiss last Sunday 
afternoon. Things just didn't go according to thei r normal plan 
Somewhere alon~ the line the Chargers did something different to alter 
the outcome of the game. 

First of all Don Woods failed to gain over 100 yards, always a 
prerequisite for a Charger loss at home. The Chargers also got the big 
play on offense, touchdown bombs of 70, 75, and 43 yards. Again it 
was something out of the ordinary. The Charger offense did rack up 
some 424 yards for the day, their usual effort, but the defense 5'tiffened, 
holding the Browns to under 300 yards offensively. So all in all it was 
an extraordinary day for the Chargers . They kicked some of their habits, 
and th Browns at the sam time. 

The locker room after the game, espeCially since the Chargers won 
was something e lse . The players want to tell the writers what a great 
game it was . There is a general feeling of Euphoria throughout the 
locker room and it doesn't wear off until the bumps and bruises begin 
to act up. 

Some examp les of dialogue found in the winners clubhouse : 
Writer : Did you feel all along that you would win the game, even 

after Pruitt returned that ki ckoff? 
Charger (Ray Wersching): There was never a doubt in my mind. 

... 

Write r: Dan (Fouts), you had a good day running the football (7 
times, 24 ya rds) . What turned you into such a good runner? 

Fouts : Fear. 

by PAul WAIf'er 
At the beginning of the quarter, 

the Intramural Dept. introduced 
to the student population a new 
fall sport, European Handball. 
The initial response to the game 
was good . The participants were 
those who were curious as to 
what this strange new game was 
like. 

• 

Now, nearly three fourths of 
the way into the quarter, the 
enthusiasm of the faithful who 
congregated in the Rec gym every 
Wednesda'y night has begun to 
noticeably dwindle . No one who 
still comes out to play can come 
up with a reason for the sudden 
loss of interest, but several in-
teresting hypotheses have arisen . 
One obvious reason was mid-
terms . The second theory being a 
bit more realistic : Perhaps the 

. European Handhall is not a 'game 
that a majority of the students 
can identify with, unlike football 
or softball. 

It would appear a's if the game 
needs much more time and 
schoolwld e expos ure to the 
students before people will come 
out to play or at least watch a 
game. For those people who hav 
played the game, they know what 
it IS and trat it is an enjoyabl~ 
sport It affords an excellent 
opportunity to those who prefer a 
strenuous sport, but without most 
of the body contact that ac-
companies most leam sports . 

The game is a blending of 
several well known games rolled 
up into one. It employs tactics of 
basketball, voll eyball and even 
some baseball , as the teams try to 
maneuver the ball down the court 
and into the opponent's goal. 

I have recently been ap-
proached by many people who 
have participated in another 
newly introduced 1M sport, Floor 
Hockey, who have asked when 
handball was goi ng to be 
scrapped, and ho key reinstated .

My answer has always been the 
same, that hockey would not be 
played until Spring quarter. It 
would seem as if hockey has 
proved popular with the students 
and they are anxious to get the 
program started again . Handball 
just needs more time to establish 
itself and if the students would 

give it a chance, the program 
millht prove successful . 

The 'IM Dept. is hopeful that 
most of the midterms are over 
with, and that the large number 
of people who origionally came 
out to play, will return and help 
establish the game as a regular in 
the 1M menagerie of sports 
available to students.

For instance, Tsukuba's north core, which in-
cludes the central library, auditoriums and other 
facilities, will . contain Basic SCiences, 
Culture/Biological Sciences, and Business Ad-
ministratiQn/Engineering Clusters. Other cores 
will be composed of Physical Education/Fine Arts, 
and Hospital/Med School Clusters . Ar-
chitecturally, particular attention is being paid to

the desired effects of the new university. 
Among these effects a~ a careful integration 

with the surrounding community, both spatially 

and functionally, so that a "sense of solidarity can 
be fostered between the university people and the 
citizens," accordinj to the university plan . T~!.s 
community, to be known as the Tsukuba New 
Town for Research and Education, is intended to 
both support and extend the values of the 
university itself. 

"Hi,h Efficiency" 
The overall effect is intended to be one in 

which the individual is encouraged to feel 
cO.!T1f~rtable with fclcilities' of "high efficiency." 
The planning handbook goes on to say, "a spatial 
structure of the campus must be of urbanity and 
high density and a higher standard of environment 
arrangements and maintenance be ensured (sic) ." 
This is in line with the university's avowed pur-

pose of serving the objectives of "advanced and 
widely varied research and educational ac-
tivities ." 

Saltman, in his speech, stated that "never 
before havewellad the opportunity to create with 
universities viable examples of model systems by 
which we would like society and cultures to 

function ." Tsukuba University, like UCSD, a 
university of the future, is indicative of the goals 
and 'interests our societies and administrators, 
pursue.

THERE's A NEW RULE OFTHUMB 
FOR WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. 

• 

AMTRAK. 
Instead of sranding on a highway, carching 

rhe breeze as rhe cars pass you by at 55 mph, 
you could be catching our cat Amtrak may nor 
be as cheap as hi rch i ng_ Bur for the little 
money you spend, you get a lor more in return. 

Nowhere else but on an Amtrak rrain do 
you get so much room along the way. 
We give you the biggest seat in travel. With 
more space around it, too. 

From our picture windows, we give you 
the kind of close-up view of America you 
can't get from highways and c1oudbanks_ 

You can get a different pbint of view, 
toO, from the people you meet 
on the train. Since there are no seat helts 
to hold you back on Amtmk, 
Yl;U can roam the train from car to car. 
Maybe grab something to drink 
at the snack bar or lounge car. And 
the prices are reasonable, too. 

On cross-country trips I you can stop off along 
the way anywhere you like. Then 

board anomer train later with 
me same ticket 

But for the time you're with LIS, 
you'll find me Amtrak rrain 
a whole different trip. Because 
we not only get you to where 

you're going, we take you away from 
the problems of air pollution, 

energy crisis and inflation. Maybe 
that's why on trains people acr more 

I ike friends than strangers. 
On yournext trip, come togerher with 

your friends on Amtrak. AAItrak.t-
