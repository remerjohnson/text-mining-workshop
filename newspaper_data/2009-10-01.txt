In late June, UCSD became 
the nation’s first public university 
to offer its students iPhone access 

to campus-related 
information. 

The first version 
of the application 
was downloaded by 
2,100 users in the 
first two days. 

An early glitch 
allowed public access 

to unauthorized personal informa-
tion through the directory feature, 
but was fixed within a few hours. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Administrative 
Computing Elazar Harel, student 
response has been overwhelmingly 
positive.

Over 8,000 people have down-
loaded the latest Version 1.1, 
released a few weeks ago and includ-
ing podcast capability, news sources, 
athletics updates, video links and a 
feature that allows users to monitor 
the exact location of campus shuttles 
in real time. 

The most popular facets of the 
application are the campus map, 
shuttle, directory and course fea-
tures, Harel said.

University spokesperson Rex 
Graham praised the thorough nature 
of the application, particularly the 
map feature. 

Harel emphasized the impor-
tance of student involvement in the 
development of the application.

Four months after a controversial A.S. Council vote nearly shut down the Student Center’s Grove Caffe, top councilmembers are moving 
forward with plans to renovate and restructure the 
student-run business over the next several weeks. 

A.S. President Utsav Gupta, along with several 
leading cabinet members, has worked closely with 
Grove student manager Thomas Frank over the 
last two weeks to generate a 
new business plan capable 
of pulling the cafe out of its 
nearly $130,000 debt. 

The Grove has suf-
fered financially since its 
conception, struggling to 
draw a profit amid grow-
ing competition from new 
campus coffee shops, heavy 
turnover among its student 
employees and diminished 
campus visibility. 

The cafe’s debt more than 
doubled last year, after coun-
cilmembers voted to hire 
former manager Cleveland 
Thomas as a full-time employ-
ee — breaking from the Grove’s 
student-run model and incur-
ring a cost of $45,000 over the 
course of a year to pay Thomas’ 
salary. 

Despite Grove’s longterm financial 
struggles, councilmembers remain 
optimistic about new business plans.

National concern about the spread 
of the H1N1 flu virus — common-
ly known as the “swine flu” — has 
prompted campus officials to prepare  
once again for a potential campus 
epidemic.

According to Student Health 
Services Director Gina Fleming, 
UCSD officials have spent the sum-
mer preparing for the threat of a 
renewed outbreak, primarily by 
spreading awareness about how to 
avoid catching the virus.

The Student Health Center 
is anticipating a shipment of the 
swine-flu vaccine from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
which should be available by early 
November.

“We are hoping to be able to have 
enough for everyone,” Fleming said.

Temporary vaccination clinics 
will be set up around campus to 
cope with the large influx of people 
expected to seek the vaccine.

Currently, the Health Center 
holds a limited amount of seasonal 
flu vaccinations available for students 
with pre-existing conditions — con-
ditions which may leave them more 
vulnerable to the swine flu virus, 
Fleming said.

Get-Well Kits — containing 
a thermometer, throat lozenges, 
Tylenol, hand sanitizer and tissues — 
are now available for $5 at the Student 
Health Center. 

“The most important item in the

Declaring solidarity with the students, faculty 
and staff who participated in the Sept. 24 system-
wide campus walkouts, the A.S. Council passed a 
resolution last night endorsing the protests and 
condemning the UC Board of Regents’ proposed 
fee increases. 

A virtually identical resolution, drafted by 
UCSD A.S. Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West, was passed by the UC Students 
Association on Sept. 13.  

“We really tried to make [the resolution] 
all-inclusive, both to students affected by priva-
tization and lack of public funding, but also to 
faculty and grad students,” West said. “The effects 
of these budget cuts are going to be widely felt by

“We tried to think about what 
students do when they’re mobile 
and walking around, and based the 
first feature ideas off that concept,” 
Harel said. 

The project began last May, when 
UCSD-app creators met with the 
iPhone Application Programming 
Club — an organization dedicated 
to sharing ideas, earning developers’ 
licences and creating applications. 

Given the growing popularity of 
the application, there is discussion of 
future developments and collabora-
tions with the club. 

Currently, programmers are 
working on Mobile UCSD, an ini-
tiative launched to develop web-
based applications with similar fea-
tures that can work with all types of 
phones. 

“Not everyone has an iPhone,” 
Harel said. “We wanted to come up 
with something for the common 
denominator.”

An application will be available 
for Blackberry phones by the end 
of the year, he said, and an updated 
iPhone application — which will 
include a calendar of campus events 

 — is slated for release in December 
or January.

Programmers are also consid-
ering adding increased news net-
working, alumni information, the 
capability to make purchases at 
the UCSD Bookstore or a tool that 

locates a user’s proximity to sculp-
tures from the Stuart Art Collection. 

Harel credits collaboration 
with the Palo Alto-based applica-
tion development company Terribly 
Clever for the success of the UCSD 
application; the company was 
responsible for designing the user 
interface, fed by live information 
provided by the university.

Stanford and Duke are the only 
other universities to offer similar 
phone applications.

“Other universities are just start-

ing to have their applications, but 
we’re definitely the first [public uni-
versity], and the others aren’t nearly 
as comprehensive and cool as the 
one UCSD has,” Graham said. 

With improvements constantly 
in development, Harel said that the 
applications design team always wel-
comes feedback and suggestions. 

“We’re very excited,” Harel said. 
“We hope people enjoy it.

NEWS� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

With Thomas gone, the cafe is 
again fully student-operated.

“We didn’t really change anything 
last year,” Gupta said. “What we did 
is we added a full-time manager, 
which is responsible for most of the 
additional debt.”

Gupta — who campaigned heav-
ily on plans to preserve and revamp 
the Grove during last year’s A.S. 
presidential election — has made 
the eatery a top priority for his first 
quarter in office. 

The Grove is currently operating 
at partial capacity — serving only 
coffee and pastries — in order to 
cope with the changes being imple-
mented. Within two weeks, the eat-
ery will shut down completely while 
major structural renovations take 
place, including a new deck and the 
installation of new interior flooring.

“In order to compete with all 
these new places that seem to be 
popping up every six minutes, we 
need to look good,” Frank said.

Frank and Gupta acknowledged 
that the cafe’s debt will increase before 
the renovations are complete. They 
estimated the deck alone will cost up 
to $10,000, while the installation of a 
new conveyor oven — similar to the 
ones seen at Quiznos restaurants — 
will cost approximately $4,000.

The cost of replacing the eat-
ery’s interior flooring has yet to be 

assessed.
“We’re going to have to build 

upon the debt to bring us out of 
debt,” Gupta said.

Frank also intends to reinvent the 
eatery’s menu, in an effort to simplify 
the customer experience and speed 
up service. They hope to strip the 
Grove’s daytime offerings down to 
sandwiches and pizzas while imple-
menting assembly-line food prepara-
tion.

“We’re going to simplify the way 
you order food at the Grove,” Gupta 
said. “We’re going to take concepts 
from Chipotle and from In-N-Out 
and really make it simple to see what 
we offer — and we’re going to reduce 
what we offer.”

Gupta has also discussed extend-
ing the Grove’s hours of operation 
past 9 p.m. — a move that would to 
capitalize on the lack of late-night 
eateries available on campus. 

“The idea is to appeal to stu-
dents coming back from parties or 
students who are up late studying 
who want somewhere to find good 
food,” Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh 
said. “There’s a void on campus right 
now for that kind of service.”

Gupta said one focus of the eat-
ery’s revamp will be a renewed pub-
licity campaign — an effort to attract 
new business to the Grove and move 
away from its reputation as strictly a 

coffee shop. 
The A.S. Graphic studio plans to 

design flyers and posters advertising 
the Grove, to be distributed through-
out campus. 

Ghosh said the council will 
absorb the cost of the campaign.

“We’re taking a realistic approach 
based on the market,” Gupta said. 
“There’s no dining hall in Muir. 
There’s no dining hall in the School 
of Medicine. Students want more 
choice in terms of where they spend 
their money. Students don’t really see 
the Grove as a food place — they see 
us more as a coffee place, which is 
accurate, but it’s not all we provide. 
We’re going to re-advertise ourselves 
as the Grove the restaurant, and not 
just the Grove the cafe”

Gupta, Frank, Ghosh and Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch hope to premier  the 
Grove in its new form by Five Week. 
They have discussed offering a full 
week of free food items in order to 
attract customers. 

“We’re going to make it so nobody 
can not know about the Grove,” 
Gupta said. “We’re going to be offer-
ing free food, free sandwiches. We 
definitely intend to see thousands of 
people try out the Grove in its first 
week of new operation.”

The A.S. Council kicked off the 2009-10 academic year with a four-hour meeting yesterday 
night. Highlights included a presenta-
tion on the current UC budget crisis 
and a debate over whether the council 
should continue funding the Koala 
campus newspaper.

Before things got heated, the A.S. 
Graphics Studio team welcomed the 
new council by taking a group shot of 
the members for their latest project: a 
“Who’s Who in A.S.” brochure.

With the 
photo op over, 
President Utsav 
Gupta introduced 
Akos Rona-Tas — 
a UCSD sociology 
professor — to 
present a lengthy, 
graph-heavy slide-
show on the state of the UC budget.

A key slide in the presentation 
evaluated the amount of money that 
the state of California spends on a UC 
student versus a prison inmate. Rona-
Tas pointed out that the state spends 
approximately $46,000 per year on 
one inmate, next to a mere $9,560 on 
the average UC student. 

Gupta called the presentation “one 
of the most useful so far,” and was 
echoed by a roomful of snaps (signi-
fying agreement).

Miscommunication between the 
council and the speech-policy com-
mittee caused the committee’s special 
presentation to be pushed to next 
week.

Campuswide Senator Katie Hall 
presented plans for UCSD’s 50th 
anniversary celebration. Three main 
events — Founder’s Day, Innovation 
UCSD and Green Open House — will 
commemorate the yearlong event 
throughout 2010-11.

Gupta then addressed a plan sug-
gesting that the Sun God Festival 

date be changed from the traditional 
Friday of Week 7 (during Spring 
Quarter) to Friday of Week 6, which 
precedes Mother’s Day weekend. The 
change was suggested to avoid con-
flict with a “potential softball game” at 
RIMAC Field.

However, Gupta disagreed. 
“I don’t want people having to 

choose between their mothers and 
a popular campus tradition,” Gupta 
said.

Marshall Senator Brian McEuen 
began the Koala 
funding debate by 
politely condemn-
ing the comedy 
newspaper’s most 
recent issue for 
poking fun at sec-
ond-year Revelle 
student-athlete 

Leon Roach, who was killed in a pole-
vaulting accident this September.

Councilmembers were split on 
whether they should continue fund-
ing such a controversial newspaper. 

“You guys say you’re support-
ive of free speech, but we have to 
take the blows that come with it,” 
said Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy.

After much discussion, the council 
voted to continue funding the Koala.

It took only a few seconds for 
the council to unanimously approve 
a resolution — authored by VP 
External Affairs Gracelynne West — 
in support of the systemwide walkout 
on Sept. 24. 

As the meeting drew to a close, 
dreary-eyed councilmembers perked 
up to sing “Happy Birthday” to 
Warren Senator Emily Law. 

In closing, Campuswide Senator 
Wafa Ben Hassine took a moment to 
let fellow councilmembers know she

There’s no doubt you’ve already heard: Our beloved univer-sity is in a dire financial cri-
sis. The state went broke, didn’t give 
the UC its $813.2 million when we 
thought it would — and then all hell 
broke loose. 

UC President Mark G. Yudof 
declared emergency powers in July 
— despite disapproval from the sys-
temwide Academic Senate and many 
other bystanders — and has since 
cut employee salaries by 10 percent, 

employed mandatory 
furloughs for UC pro-
fessors and staff and 
proposed to hike stu-
dent fees by 32 per-
cent for 2010-11. 

His actions are 
based on a simple 
premise that he 
explained in his June 

22 furlough proposal: “There are no 
perfect choices for how to achieve 
the needed cost-savings.” He said that 

value should be placed on a plan that 
“reflects an appropriate balance cen-
tered on fairness and sacrifice.” 

True — but Yudof seems to have a 
different definition of what’s fair. 

Hiking next year’s fees by 32 per-
cent is not fair to students who have 
struggled to afford an education since 
fees began steadily rising eight years 
ago. Neither is cutting 10 percent from 
already meager salaries.

A less-accessible and therefore 
more privatized public univer-
sity not only contradicts the UC’s 
founding principles, but it also hurts 
California’s chances of bouncing back 
from its current financial dilemma. 
An educated workforce has played a 
crucial role in California’s past suc-
cess: Both Silicon Valley and San 
Diego’s biotech industries have ben-
efitted from the talent, research funds 
and capital tied to the UC system. 

The regents must explore other 
options before cutting from essen-
tials. These include: reducing the 
salaries of the top 2 percent of UC 
earners, considering use of the UC 
medical centers’ profits to preserve 
basic academic essentials and utiliz-
ing funds from the UC’s short-term 
investment portfolio. 

Since the start of this budget cri-
sis, Yudof has defended high-paying 
executives and insisted that the uni-
versity maintain “competitive” mar-
ket prices to retain essential talent. 
But if we’re already so desperate as 
to cut most employee salaries while 
demanding more from struggling 
students, we can no longer offer the 
same high-end salaries as our peer 
universities.

We back the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees Local 3299’s recommen-
dation to reduce the top 2 percent of 
University of California earners. This 
cut would apply to roughly 3,600 
individuals earning over $200,000 
per year, and free $220 million for 
other critical priorities. 

This would, granted, apply dis-
proportionately higher cuts to those 
earning more. Employing different 
cuts for four income levels, AFSCME 

recommends cutting 18 percent from 
all wages ranging from $200,000 to 
$225,000, and 24 percent from all 
those above $300,000.

In other words salary cuts to a few 
thousand top executives 
would yield $20 million 
more than Yudof ’s pro-
posal to raise fees for all 
220,000 UC students.

More than anything, 
the UC leadership’s will-
ingness to sacrifice their 
luxuries for the greater 
good of our institution 
would unite them with 
workers and students in 
coping with the strained 
economy. 

Yudof has also 
ignored any possibility 
of temporarily utilizing 
the UC medical centers’ 
high profits to offset 
some of the academic 
slashing. According to 
AFSCME Local 3299, 
if the UC medical centers continue 
with the financial success reported 
in the first nine months of the fis-
cal year, they could potentially have 
earned over $200 million in profits 
for the most recent fiscal year.

Though medical centers’ net prof-
its are set aside to serve a specific 
function, Yudof should at least con-
sider using a small percentage of 
that cash to fill in gaping holes at the 
operational level. After all, the 1997-
98 Budget for Current Operations 
shows that UC execs used medi-
cal-center assets to meet emergency 
needs during the budget crises of 
1993 and 1995.

Though it’s unclear whether our 
medical center would be able to lend 
us a hand, we’ll never know without a 
push from Yudof himself.

Currently, the UC also holds an 
investment portfolio chock full of 
liquid assets.

Though much of the portfolio is 
restricted to fund different programs, 
$1.4 billion of its assets are allocated 
to the Mortgage Orientation Program 
— a system that allows UC executives 

and tenured faculty to take out low-
interest loans through the university.

Currently, $800 million dollars of 
the fund’s reserves are unused. We 
suggest using these reserves to fill the 

gaps in core operations. 
According to AFSCME, 
it could offset up to 98 
percent of the state’s 
reduction to our gener-
al-funds revenue.

Even if it means 
freezing complimen-
tary low-interest loans 
for UC hotshots, it 
would aid those at the 
bottom who don’t have 
the privilege to such 
monetary aid but des-
perately need it.

Not to mention, in 
1993, the University of 
California used $43 mil-
lion of short-term invest-
ment funds to alleviate 
budgetary problems. If 
it was a possibility then, 

Yudof should consider it now, too.
Though we do not expect the uni-

versity to rip apart its every last asset 
to save our education, we do expect 
Yudof to get much more creative 
before he raises student fees and cuts 
staff salaries. For those of us who can’t 
hold on much longer, it’s the only fair 
thing to do.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2007. Views expressed herein represent the majority 

vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 

the members of the Guardian staff. 

Last Thursday’s walkout was the largest protest I’ve ever witnessed at UCSD. 
But it’s one thing to miss a 

single day of syllabus handouts, and 
quite another to protest for days, 
weeks, months — however long it 
takes — to ensure our fees don’t 
skyrocket and our services don’t 
dwindle. 

While studying abroad in France 
last year, I witnessed a national 
uprise of students who saw a threat 
to public education and reacted 
with nine weeks of protests. 

My university, Sciences-Po Lyon, 
and other schools across the coun-
try boycotted the classroom for the 
same reasons that drove students to 
storm lecture halls on the first day 
of instruction here at UCSD: rising 
tuition costs, the demand for uni-
versal access to a quality education 
and uncertainty about the future of 
public education itself. 

The students at my French uni-
versity were upset because tuition 
had risen to just under 2,000 euros 
— a 10-percent increase. That’s 
chump change next to Yudof ’s pro-
posal to increase fees 32 percent.

Relative to our tuition, French 
students are charged peanuts. But 
that didn’t stop them from fight-
ing even harder. Seeing students 
march through the streets made me 
question whether my own country 
values education as much as France 
does. 

Understandably, some American 
students in my program weren’t 
thrilled to have such a large part 
of their year abroad disrupted by 
a movement in which they weren’t 
invested. But I saw it as cultural 
immersion at its finest: What’s 
more French than weeks of block-
ading university buildings and dis-
cussing the movement’s future over 
bottles of wine? 

Without a doubt, the most 
nerve-racking — and, in the end, 
rewarding — moment of my entire 
year abroad was when I stood 
before 700 French students at one 
of my university’s general assem-
blies and delivered an impromptu 
speech about the need to set an 
example for students worldwide. 
Clearly, the French aren’t the only 
ones facing threats to higher educa-
tion. My hands had long stopped 
trembling by the time I wrapped up 
my main point: Their movement’s 
success could inspire the courage 
in others to ignite movements of its 
kind globally.

I couldn’t have anticipated a bet-
ter lesson in linguistics: When you 
speak to hundreds of your foreign 
peers about their own country’s 
problems, you better be damn sure 
to use the right form of subjunctive.

As the movement progressed, 
I came to view the protests as a 
necessary part of my young-adult 
education. I was surrounded by 
a mass of students who were not 
only outspoken about their current 
grievances, but were also willing to 
take a stand for the future of public

universities, to which they believe 
every citizen should have equal 
access. 

Some UCSD students told me 
they didn’t walk out because they 
didn’t want to waste a moment of 
their already overpriced education, 
and it seemed others simply didn’t 
know what the hell was going on. 

Yet every day at Sciences Po, 
there were dozens of student orga-
nizers handing out pamphlets, lead-
ing informational discussions and 
planning demonstrations. Instead 
of ignoring fellow students shout-
ing and marching by — as so many 
of us did during the walkout — 
most French students would at least 

participate in the public debate, 
regardless of where their loyalties 
laid. Students couldn’t return from 
a single day of school without an 
armful of fliers outlining the pro-
testors’ demands. 

UCSD’s walkout, however, 
offered no literature to students 
who were intrigued by the mob’s 
action yet didn’t know what it was 
about. 

In France, general assemblies 
were held at specific times each 
week; every march through the 
city had a set route. This level of 
organization lent the movement a 
legitimacy ours lacked. Last week, 
all we managed to do (and I say 
this not to criticize, but to moti-

vate) was disrupt class. Shouting 
“WALK OUT PETERSON!” doesn’t 
begin to inform students about why 
they should walk out and what they 
can do personally to help the move-
ment. 

Until we exhibit the same level 
of dedication in our protest that my 
French peers did, the administra-
tion won’t take us seriously. The art 
of effective protest involves more 
than aimless shouting and blind 
rage; it requires both clear direction 
and widespread education. We’d 
be wise to take a few tips from the 
sauvignon blanc-sipping experts 
across the Atlantic — because no 
one knows how to riot like the 
French.

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Dear Editor,
I would like to take exception to 

the statement made in Trevor Cox’s 
article (“We Need an Education, Not 
a Podcast,” run on Sept. 24): “Or do 
we accept the fact that, for now, we 
can’t afford to keep the expensive 
professors and research that gave the 
university its esteemed reputation?”

As one of those you mention, I 
note the following:

I pay 100 percent of my sal-
ary from my research funds and 
teach at no cost to the University of 
California. 

The construction of the building 
I work in was paid for and is main-
tained by grant funds, even though it 
supports education.

When I hire an undergraduate 
part-time during the school year, I 
am personally providing financial aid 
using my grant funds.

And when an undergraduate does 
independent-study research in my 
lab, I am paying for costs associated 
with his or her education with my 
grant funds.

In fact, the UC system has never 
spent any money on me or my lab.

Thus, I’m not sure exactly how 
people like me make the UC system 
more costly.

More interestingly, because of 
people like me, the UC system has a 
very successful research and clinical 
program that accounts for more than 
75 percent of the UC budget — virtu-
ally all of which is financed by funds 
the faculty raise. If you calculate how 
much state and local taxes are paid 
due to the expenditure of the UC 
budget, it ranges from a low of $2.1 
billion to a high of $2.3 billion per 
year. Which is basically to say that 
because of its large research and clini-
cal enterprise, the UC system doesn’t, 
in net, cost the state anything.

Isn’t the solution to accurately 
explain the UC system’s financial situ-
ation, and thus, argue for a realistic 
level of state support that would result 
in lowering tuition to what it was in 
the ‘60s and ‘70s, when the UC mas-
ter plan was last in force?

everyone at university.”
While the council held its weekly 

meeting in Price Center East and 
discussed the new resolution, the 
group that organized the campus 
walkout — the UCSD Coalition to 
Save Our Futures — came togeth-
er two floors below at the Cross-
Cultural Center to discuss the 
Coalition’s next move. 

Though the group’s ultimate goal 
is a large-scale rally at the Nov. 17 
regents meeting at UCLA — where 
university officials will vote on the 
proposed 32-percent student-fee 
increase — there are several other 
projects the coalition plans to tackle 
in the meantime.

Until then, the group’s main pri-
ority is increasing public awareness 
about the university’s current budget 
crisis.

“We’ll be having further teach-
ins throughout the year, reaching 
out to organizations, trying to be 
on Library Walk as much as pos-
sible,” West said. “[We’ll] continue 
to talk to students, keeping them 

informed and letting them know 
about [things] like the resolution we 
just passed.”

The first of several planned 
teach-ins will take place on Oct. 
14. The Coalition also has other 
projects in motion: These include 
lobbying legislators at both local 
and state levels, passing out fly-
ers on Library Walk and demand-
ing a larger role for undergraduates 
in the university’s newly proposed 
Senate-Administration Task Force 
on Budget. 

A series of subcommittees has 
been created to handle the various 
aspects of the coalition’s efforts. 

“We didn’t educate as many stu-
dents as we’d have liked to [before 
the walkout],” Revelle College senior  
Sam Jung, who lead the discussion 
at the Coalition meeting, said. “We 
basically had five days to get this 
rally and this teach-in together, so 
we did bomb."

kit is the thermometer,” Fleming 
said. “Once you’re sick, you should 
stay away from others until your 
fever has been gone for 24 hours … 
Using the thermometer can help you 
monitor whether you are ready to 
come back into contact with other 
people.”

The center has maintained week-
ly communication with the county 
and the state, geared specifically 
toward emergency response and 
prevention.

“We never stop planning,” 
Fleming said.

UCSD has also begun accept-
ing  a number of additional health-
care providers, allowing the Student 
Health Center to see more students 
on a daily basis. 

Additionally, a separate waiting 
area for students with influenza-
like symptoms has been set up at 
the center to prevent contamina-
tion —though Fleming said students 
should not visit the center seeking  a 
swine-flu test, as it is only available 
to those patients admitted to the 
intensive-care unit.

 “Whether you have swine flu or 

not doesn’t affect treatment options 
or recommendations,” Fleming said.

According to Fleming, people 
under the age of 24 are particu-
larly at risk for contracting the virus, 
because of certain behaviors. 

For example,  she said, they tend 
to share food and drinks, often 
forget to cover their mouths when 
coughing or sneezing and neglect to 
wash their hands thoroughly.

In addition, a college setting puts 
young people in daily contact with 
thousands of other students and fac-
ulty members, making them par-
ticularly vulnerable to the swine-flu 
virus.

Campuses around the country 
have felt the effects of the virus this 
year.

For example, at UC Berkeley, 
there were a reported 40 to 50 cases 
of flu-like symptoms per week dur-
ing the summer alone.

Over 600 cases of swine flu have 
been reported at Cornell University 
since August. One 20-year-old stu-
dent reportedly died due to compli-
cations with the H1N1 virus. 

Emory University in Georgia, has 
seen over 200 reported cases of the 

swine flu, and has set aside a dorm 
area for H1N1 patients to recover.

In order to help prevent the 
spread of the virus, Flemings rec-
ommends that students wash their 
hands thoroughly with soap and 
water or an alcohol-based hand 
sanitizer, cover their mouth when 
coughing or sneezing and avoid 
sharing beverages. 

Additionally, at the CDC’s recom-
mendation, Student Heath Services 
has implemented a buddy system.

If a student is feeling ill and 
wants someone to check up on them 
or bring them food and fluids, they 
can email flubuddy@ucsd.edu, and a 
Student Health Advocate will come 
to his or her assistance.

Student Health representatives  
recommend that if a student has any 
general questions or is feeling ill, it is

HIATUS PICKS THE WEEK’S BEST BETS

THIS WEEK ON CAMPUS

Writer/director Cherien Dabis makes her feature-ﬁlm debut 
with a dramedy that puts a fresh spin on the immigrant 
experience. When single mother Muna (Nisreen Faour) and 
her teenage son Fadi (Melkar Muallem) decide to leave the 
West Bank in search of a new life in America, they’re faced 
with major culture shock: Instead of navigating through 
military checkpoints, Fadi has to ﬁnd a way to survive high 
school while his mother ﬂips burgers at the local White 
Castle. The two struggle to ﬁnd their niche in the midwest 
while staying true to their heritage. (JB)

Tour of  
Thizz: DIY 
Journey Goes 
Dumb, Dumb

T he following is a travelogue from a two-week West coast tour that my band, Nobody Wave, and my 
neighborhood friends’ band, Pretend, 
embarked on this summer. Last week, 
I left you in a sick binge of Indian cui-

sine on Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz. 
That night, the gang rolled over 

to my close friend Stephen’s place on 
Bay Street, where we’d planned a free 
impromptu show for whoever cared 
to come. Stephen was psyched to see 
us and quickly procured cardboard 
and Christmas lights for self-promo-
tion purposes. We strung the lights in 
a haphazard maze outside and inside 
the house, around the Econovan and 
along the “Free Show” signs we had 
Sharpeed with beaming stick-figure 
faces. A few of my friends showed up 
with a few of their friends, and soon 
we had a bona fied party. 

Tragically, the po-po were called 
after just one Pretend jam, but we had 
a bit of time before quiet hours, so we 
each finished a short set. Stephen was 
so impressed with his house-turned-
venue that he decided to christen it 
the Bay St. Music Box, hoping more 
bands would roll through someday. 
We partied the rest of the night at a 
lower volume, gathering kumbaya-
style on the hardwood floor.

Early the next morning, we col-
lected our gear and split up with 
Pretend, planning to meet up later 
on in San Francisco. We drove up to 
UC Santa Cruz for some authentic 
burritos and then went on a tide-pool 
beach walk before setting out for 
the Bay. When we got to Cal’s friend 
April’s apartment in Lower Haight, we 
decided to take our day off easy and 
hit up Dolores Park to lounge in the 
shade and sap on Slurpees. 

However, we soon got bored 
watching weirdos hula-hoop so we 
headed back to April’s and helped 
Pretend lug the gear up the three 
brutal flights of stairs to her place. 
After some local pizza and late-night 
deep conversations over High Life, we 
passed out in sleepy sardine rows.

The next day was epic. The whole 
crew wanted to see our buddy Mike’s 
art show downtown, so we trekked 
through Haight and Japantown until 
we got to a high-rise gallery by Union 
Square. We spent a good hour admir-
ing Mike’s meticulous tally-line draw-
ings (and other photo exhibits) before

I n the same change-the-world, DIY vein as 2004’s fast food expose “Super Size Me” comes this year’s token environmentary: 
“No Impact Man,” one guilty liberal’s experi-
mental attempt at turning his family into 
ecological guinea pigs.

Author Colin Beaven, his wife Michelle 
and their two-year-old daughter Isabella 
make the radical decision to phase out all 

environmentally unfriendly aspects of their 
Fifth Avenue New York lifestyle. No food that 
is not locally grown, no meat, no trash of any 
kind, no form of carbon-producing transpor-
tation, no television, no buying anything new 
for a year and no disposable diapers. 

Sound rough? Over time, the family learns 
to live without electricity — that’s right, no 
lights, no microwave, no refrigerator. 

Even the most extreme recycling-obsessed 
tree-huggers out there have to admit, this 
seems a tad extreme. But that was Beaven’s 

intention: to find out whether it’s physically

Despite the glaring expletive, Starfucker isn’t exactly edgy. In fact, they’re trying really hard not to be: The indie electro-
pop trio from Portland, Ore. recently announced 
a name-changing contest in which the fan who 
comes up with an FCC-friendly moniker to the 
band’s liking wins a free concert. 

While their current rather risque name has 
supposedly (according to the band) hindered 
Starfucker’s ability to reach a widespread audi-
ence through mainstream media outlets and 
booking agencies, Starfucker’s studio albums are 
painstakingly radio friendly. Aside from sam-
pling the late Buddhist philosopher Alan Watts, 
nothing separates the band from the plethora

Open-ended health-care reform may be eclipsing economic woes on the political frontier, but the La Jolla Playhouse is doting on debt — of the marital type. In the house’s latest production, Creditors, news pundit jargon of subprime mortgaging relents to the lexicon 
of bitter spouses. Adapted by Doug Wright from August Strindberg’s original play, Creditors 

centers on a quarreling menage a trois whose simplification of marriage into a creditor-
debtor relationship lands them in divorce and suspicions of adultery. With an unapolo-

getically acerbic script, the play disembowels marriage with little hesitation.

 Set in a Swedish sea resort, the 
three-act play opens with Adolf, a 
nonplussed artist, and his pseudo-
psychiatrist Gustav (who takes on 
the Freudian persona, complete 
with circular glasses and a tweed 
vest). Uncertain of his coquettish 
wife Tekla’s fidelity and haunted 
by thoughts of her first husband, 
Adolf mopes in the doldrums and 
resigns from painting altogether. 
Feeling stuck like “a frozen 
clock,” he looks to Gustav to 
wind him back up, but is met 
only by the shrink’s misogy-
nist sensibilities. 

Gustav warps Adolf ’s 
mentality, leading the 
troubled artist to believe 

that a “naked woman is an underdevel-
oped boy with tits, who hemorrhages 
every month.” But in the second act, 
Gustav’s oddly extensive knowledge of 
Tekla’s affairs slowly unravels, bringing 
to light connections between characters 
that weren’t immediately apparent. 

By the third act, these blurred rela-
tionships are solidified when Gustav 
reveals himself to be Tekla’s first hus-
band, a creditor in his own right, col-
lecting the dues of Tekla’s adulterous 
love for Adolf and her degradation of 
his honor.  

Loaded with dramatic irony, the 
play uses modern expletives and 
graphic one-liners to revamp it from

��THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2009� HIATUS

I the room. “Don’t go to The Econ Tutor, it is a waste of time. Last quarter, I had to fail thirty students” because they went to him. The students are looking away. Everyone is 
uncomfortable.

The Economics Department is attacking me again. Over time, I have learned that some 
instructors would say and do anything to discredit me, but I never thought they would go 
so low as to attack me by attacking my students. My students ask: 

“WHY DO THEY HATE YOU SO MUCH?”  DO THEY VIEW ME AS A THREAT ? DOES MY 
VERY  EXISTENCE  PUT A SPOTLIGHT  ON THEIR  DEFICIENCIES ?  ARE THEY EMBARRASSED  

THAT 10, 20 AND EVEN 50% OF THEIR  CLASS WILL ATTEND  MY REVIE W SESSIONS ? 

I think at some level, the University views me as threat. They tell the legislature that they  provide world class research and instruction. But in reality, the quality of teaching is very uneven. There are wonderful instructors at UCSD, but sometimes being a good 
researcher doesn’t translate into being a good instructor.  Sometimes they are too busy 
to care about teaching and their lectures are unclear, disorganized or no longer relevant.

In this environment of uneven quality and overworked teaching assistants, outside in-
structors provide a useful service. In a negative light, I serve as a safety net when the 
course instructor is lacking and the students are frustrated and lost.  But in a positive light, 

-
rial or by providing a convenient late night session for students who have to juggle their 
course load with outside jobs. Moreover, I provide a continuity of instruction to a system 

F or almost ten years, I have run a review service called TheEconTutor. It started with private one-on-one tutorials, but as I became more popular, we transitioned into 
twelve. The following quarter, I had thirty and so we grew until we currently have over a 
thousand students.

THIS SUMMER, OVER 20 OF MY STUDENTS  WERE CHARGED  WITH ACADEMIC  MIS-
CONDUCT FOR ATTENDING  ONE OF MY REVIE W SESSIONS .

Last spring, an inexperienced instructor, Dr. Bernotas, was teaching an upper level eco-
nomics (Econ 120B) class of 200 students. He assigned a take-home exam with very 
unusual instructions. Normally, on a take home exam, students are suppose to work by 
themselves; Dr. Bernotas told his students they could work in groups of three people. Fur-
thermore, those groups of three could consult with other groups. The day he handed out 
the exam, he even told the class that “ I don’t care if you work in groups as long as you don’t 
turn in a hundred of the same thing.” Given those instructions, the students and I felt that 
we could hold a review session for the take home exam.

Weeks later, the students were charged with academic misconduct. The formal charges 
said that even though they could work in groups, their work should not have been so simi-
lar to each other, and the similarities indicated that they copied from a common source. 
Faced with an unapproachable and inept instructor, these students turned to me for help. 
These students did not copy from a common source, they were taught by me.

T If they could not answer it, then they should look at it again to see if they could 
answer it. If the students could still not answer the question, then Dr. Bernotas said they 
should ask the TA for help. If they still did not understand, then and only then, should they 
ask him for help. As one senior explains:

I have never had a professor as bad as that. I have had professors who were 
worse teachers but at least they would talk to you. This guy was completely un-
approachable. He didn’t care. That is basically it. He didn’t care. I guess he is of-
fended or he has some ego problems with students getting outside help. Maybe 
he feels that he is the professor of the class so we are supposed to go to him, but 

with the quality of instruction but the major spikes in demand occur when you have an in-

were similar in size and had inexperienced instructors. In Dr. Wang’s class, 35 students at-
tended my review session. For Dr. Bernotas’ class, I had 56.

W with the Dean of Students for their college. Sometimes, for my students, the initial meeting was merely to discuss the situation, but often the Dean had a 
list of punishments that the students could accept to resolve the matter quickly or could 
reject to continue the matter through a hearing process. A student describes his meeting 
with the Dean:

She continuously stated: it has to be yes or no. Black or white. “Did you cheat or 
not?” I am a good student. I already had an A in the class and I did not need to 
cheat. I have never been accused on anything of this nature before. Going into 
the meeting, I was expecting that they would listen to me and we would quickly 
resolve this. Instead it was like talking to a brick wall. 

one who cheated on 120B.” It was like I was already judged. I was trying to explain 
my situation and I could tell she wasn’t listening. “Did you cheat or not? Yes or no!” 
I said no and she said that I would have to go to a hearing and that wouldn’t take 
place for several months. I was planning to graduate in the summer and I already 
had a job lined up for me in China. I cannot wait until the end of the year. She 
kept on pressuring me to say that I cheated and she told me that she could not 
wait any longer for my answer and that she had to go to another meeting. “Did 
you cheat or do you want to wait until the end of  the year to resolve this?” I was 
thinking that I cannot wait. I felt sick to my stomach, but I said, “I guess I cheated.”

I was just trying to be a good student. I go to TheEconTutor because it acts as a 
TA reviews, only better. We work through the problems and it really helps. I’m 
mad because I spend a lot of time on the questions before the sessions and work 

I went to TheEconTutor, then…I cheated.

E ven though the Dean presented cheating as a simple yes or no question, experts in academic misconduct know that it is often ambiguous. As Dr. Gallant, UCSD Coordi-nator of Academic Integrity points out in her blog, faculty and administrator often 
say that the rules are common sense but she readily admits “students are swimming in a 
sea of confusion surrounding over ‘what is academic misconduct’”.   

As I work and write in the area of academic integrity, I am continually amazed 
at the complexity of the issue for most everyone… When we talk about student 
academic (mis)conduct, we need to acknowledge up front with students how 
unclear the situation really is.

Even though the situation is often unclear, faculty and administrators want a simple pro-
cedure to process cases. As Dr. Gallant writes:

I have a confession to make---I just realized this morning that I have been focused 
(nay, obsessed) on the number of cases that come in my door and how quickly 
they are being resolved…. I am enamored with routinely crunching numbers--
-How many cases did we have reported at this time last year? How quickly did 
we get them resolved? How many pretty graphs can I create which pictorially 
represent the increase in the number of cases?

And people love it! Administrators and faculty love getting this information. They 
love to see that more faculty are reporting student cheating. They love to see the 
majority of cases are resolved without formal hearings….And I love to be loved.

T he penalties for academic misconduct are potentially quite harsh. Besides receiving a failing grade and having your academic record permanently crippled, you can be suspended or expelled from UCSD. Almost all of these students were Asian, and 
frightening; if they are suspended they lose their visa and they will be deported. Regard-
less of how slight the infraction or how dubious the charges, students are in a horrible 
life-altering situation. The students know that they are at the mercy of the administration 
and they have an enormous incentive to cooperate.  That is why,  Dr. Gallants’s observation 
that the faculty love to see that the majority of these cases are resolved without a formal 
hearing is so chilling.  Some students are not accepting their punishment and forgoing 
a hearing because they are guilty, they are forgoing a hearing because they are afraid of 
being deported.

T his is not a simple case of cheating. It is not a simple case in which a student copied the answer from another student during an in-class exam or when a student went -
tion that they were receiving from UCSD and went to an outside instructor for help. Fifty 
six students did not go to my review session to commit misconduct. They did not sponta-
neous decide to have a cheat party. They came to me to learn.

HIATUS� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN� 

THIS SUMMER, ONE OF MY STUDENTS TOLD ME A FUNNY STORY. HE WAS TALKING TO ONE 
OF HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FRIEND EXCLAIMED, “I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE TAKING SIX 

COURSES THIS SUMMER.” MY STUDENT REPLIED, “IT IS NOT SO HARD, AFTER ALL, I ONLY HAVE 
ONE PROFESSOR…MY PROFESSOR IS THEECONTUTOR, I SEE HIM FOR EVERYTHING!”

INSTRUCTION AT THEECONTUTOR

One of the misperception about TheEconTutor is that we are merely a place to get answers. It is true that if you come to my sessions, you will get answers but you will also leave with 10 to 20 pages worth of notes and a couple hours 
worth of instructions.

The majority of my reviews are spent working through practice problems. My answers 
tend to be long and meticulous. New students often have to pause and shake out their 
fingers because their hands are not used to writing so much and the older students 
knowingly smile at them. 

In fact, my answers will often last one or two pages when the solution in the answer 
key is only one or two sentences and this frustrates some students.  But it is through 
my answers that I give my lectures and introduce the key concepts that my students 
need to learn. So instead of giving one long lecture, I give several mini-lectures as I 
work through our problems. 

When we have homework sessions, we work on the              actual problems. This makes some professors anx-ious but I feel it is appropriate and it is what I did as a 
Teaching Assistant at UCSD. The point of homework is to motivate 
students to study the material before their exams. It introduces 
them to difficult material and it encourages them to seek help if 
they need it. While there is merit in solving difficult problems by 
yourself, there is also merit from having careful and experienced 
instruction which makes difficult problems seem less intimat-
ing. This provides context so that students can see the linkages 
to problems that they have already solved and which can turn a 
solitary grind into a supportive and interactive group experience. 

I take homework very seriously because I believe that students 
cannot succeed on their exams if they do not know the material 
on their homework. The bottom line for any review service is that students will not 
return to you unless they do well on their exams. The incentives to teach your students 
effectively and efficiently are very strong. If my students do not learn and do not suc-
ceed on their exams, then my business fails. 

I am fairly strict.  My students have to sit-up straight and pay attention. They are not 
allowed to eat meals, talk to their neighbors, use their cell phones, leave before the 
session ends, and laptop use is limited to specific computer intensive projects. I need 
these rules in order to be productive and it is a trade-off that my students are willing 
to make. 

The strictness is tempered by an atmosphere of familiarity. It starts with learning their names but it really results from our high retention rates. In a typical year, a thousand students will go to TheEconTutor.  Sometimes, they only attend one or 
two classes but there is a core of about 250 students who come to us for all their class-
es. These core students typically come to us during their junior year. By the time they 
graduate, they will have come to us for help in 10 to 15 classes, they will have attended 
60 to 90 review sessions and I will have spent 120 to 180 hours teaching them. This 
creates the strong bonds of trust and familiarity that are at the heart of my business.

WHAT AND WHO IS THEECONTUTOR
I have undergraduate degrees in Biology-Chemistry and Literature from Pitzer Col-
lege. My senior thesis was a joint project with Los Alamos National Laboratory and was 
one of the first applications of magnetic resonance to living systems. However I soon 
tired of laboratory work and became active in protest movement against the Reagan 
Administration’s policy toward Central America. I joined a Peace Brigade and then 
traveled through much of Central America. The region was suffering from extreme 
poverty, civil war and death squads. I walked through slums and visited prison camps. 

This made me interested in the economic aspect of repression and I started studying 
economics at University of New Mexico where I received a Masters Degree and worked 
as an instructor teaching intermediate micro and macro economics. 

I moved to San Diego and became a graduate student at UCSD. Although I withdrew from the program before I finished my doctorate, I passed all my qualifying exams and I was one or two classes short of completing all my course work for a PhD. My 
advisor was George Borjas who is the country’s leading scholar on Immigration and 
who subsequently left UCSD for an endowed chair at Harvard University. At UCSD, 
I was a Teaching Assistant for several courses and was a research assistant for Julian 
Betts (the current chairman of the economics department) and Hal White (perhaps 
the departments most distinguished scholar). I also studied econometrics under two 
Nobel Laureates: Professors Engel and Granger.

In retrospect, going to UCSD was mistake. The theoretical and technical slant of the 
department was not a good fit with my humanistic concerns. My father was math-
ematician and he made sure that I had the technical skill to survive and occasionally 
flourish, but I lacked any passion. Increasingly, I sought refuge in the Visual Arts and 
in particular painting.  This was especially true after my mother unexpectedly died 
of a brain aneurism.  However during my last year at UCSD, I rededicated myself to 
economics. Unfortunately, this was not because of a renewed love of the topic but 
because my father contracted an aggressive form of brain cancer; he requested that 
I complete my doctorate before he died. I worked on a project under Prof White to 
develop neural networks. Mainly I worked on software, but I hoped that this would be 
the foundation of my dissertation. In any case, the cancer worked faster than I did and 

I stopped working on the project when my father died.

THE TURNING POINT
This started a particularly dark period in my life. But it was from 
that darkness that TheEconTutor emerged. I was very close to my 
parents and now they were both dead. I felt very alone and angry.  
I felt like a failure for letting my father down. I was sick of econom-
ics and the drudgery of being a research assistant. Art has always 
been an escape for me, so I decided to be a painter.  Although I had 
a few shows, I was not able to sell any of my paintings. I became 
poorer and poorer and soon I was homeless. At this point, I should 
have turned to my relatives and friends for help but I felt cut-off 
from the world. 

WITH ONLY $200 LEFT, I WENT TO TARGET AND BOUGHT A TENT AND A SLEEPING BAG AND 
WENT TO LIVE IN THE NATURE RESERVE ACROSS FROM RIMAC. NOW I HAD $130 LEFT AND 
WHILE I COULD SHOWER AT THE GYM AND EAT RAMEN NOODLES FOR FEW DOLLARS A DAY, I 

NEEDED A WAY TO EARN SOME INCOME.
You can always earn some money by being a subject in medical experiments, but my 
big break came when I saw a flyer from a student needing help in econometrics.  I still 
remember when that student offered me $75 to tutor her for 10 hours a week. Since 
my living expenses were down to $15 a week, it truly felt like I hit the mother lode. Af-
ter a quarter or two, I became increasingly popular and my schedule would quickly fill-
up. Eventually, as it became harder to get an appointment, students would crash the 
appointments of their friends and that is how I started doing group tutorials. As the 
groups got bigger and bigger, we moved from one location to the next until now we 
have a classroom for fifty students in a shopping mall across from campus. There was 
never any business plan except to survive the latest attempt of the Econ Department 
to shut us down. I knew that we had made it when an instructor called TheEconTutor a 
parasite in his midterm exam. Imagine, five hundred students having to intensely read 
about TheEconTutor during their exam. You cannot buy publicity like that!

I stayed in that forest for a year and half. The freedom from fiscal constraints gave me 
time to learn the undergraduate curriculum but mainly it gave me time to rebuild my 
soul. Tutoring, especially private tutoring is a wonderful way to fill the loneliness in 
your life.  During the hours that you spend with your students, you help them with 
their classes but you also help them weather the turbulence in their lives. You get to 
learn about their friends and family and even the names of their pets, but more than 
anything, you get to feel needed again. I think that is why I try to keep our rates low 
and why I try to help my students in all their classes.  I have an almost compulsive need 
to be needed and helping theses students was the way I rebuilt my life.

ALBUMREVIEWS

E ven at their conception, Crown City Rockers never fit neatly into a 
hip-hop concept box. The 
band’s 2001 debut, Mission: 
One, spills over into jazz and 
even dabbles in classical as 
the Oakland, Calif. fivesome 
showcases its unique back-
ground as a former student 
clique at the elite Berkley 
College of Music. 

Eight years later, the 
group’s third full-length, The 
Day After Forever, breaks that 
music box wide open.

Since their popular 
sophomore Earthtones in 
2004, the Crown City mem-
bers have honed their craft 
on solo and side projects 
including emcee Rashaan 
Ahmad’s two solo efforts in 
as many years. Now, they 
come back smarter, slicker 
and more versatile. Forgoing 
interludes and instrumentals, 

Ahmad gets right on first 
track “Soul,” spitting over 
an upbeat rhythm heavy on 
the hats, laced with synth, 
saxiphone and a fluttering 
flute melody. 

Featured vocalists Silya 
and Solas B. Lalgee bring the 
Crown City jazz factor to the 
next level, pseudo-scatting 
on their respective tracks. 
Production takes a large leap 
as well; guitar dances around 
a melody laid by brassy 
synths and held by heavy bass 
on the intro to “Go On” — 
while “Break” could straight-
up pass as a party-rock track. 

Listening to Forever, it’s 
clear that the quintet had no 
rust to shake off after the five-
year vacation. Instead, they 
came back with new, fresh 
perspectives to think even 
further out of the box.

NorCal Music Nerds Spit Smart-Hop

T hree Days Grace is all grown up. Remember the days when Adam Gontier 
had the moptop and wore 
black coats during the One-X 
phase? All the songs about 
being misunderstood and 
losing control, bashing away 
at four-chord wonders in the 
garage? Face it — it doesn’t 
get more teenage than “I Hate 
Everything About You.”

With Life Starts Now, 
they’ve finally come off 
puberty, though the evi-
dence is subtle on lead single 
“Break.” Most of the track is 
just another humdrum hard-
rock anthem like “Riot” — 
but we’re banging our heads 
anyway, because Barry Stock 
has discovered the power of 
palm-muting. 

Once we get to “Lost In 
You,” though, we have to 
stop and rub our eyes — is 
this Oasis? It might not be 

expected, but 3DG is sur-
prisingly earnest on their 
first real grown-up love 
ballad. Its verses are unspec-
tacular, but its chorus is built 
for singing along (or for 
“Sleepless in Seattle 2”).

Of course, the newly 
minted adults occasionally 
regress with mopey cuts like 
the ranty “Someone Who 
Cares,” but mostly make up 
for it on the climax title track. 

Life’s a lot like One-X 
in that it ends on a hopeful 
note. The difference is that 
One-X reeked of predestined 
success — Life’s more about 
picking up the pieces. 

Wall o‘distortion and 
honest Oasis? If Grace can 
keep it fresh like this, hell — 
we won’t mind if this former 
high-school favorite keeps 
playing into middle age.

Nu-Rock Rioters Learn to Tone Shit Down

P earl Jam churned out yet another album this summer, Nirvana’s set 
to release live material in 
November and Alice in Chains 
just dropped its first studio 
album since 1995. Children of 
the ’90s: Grow your hair out 
and dust off that plaid button-
up, because grunge is back.

After vocalist Layne 
Stanley’s fatal heroin over-
dose in 2002, AIC makes an 
improbable comeback with 
Black Gives Way to Blue. From 
a sprinkling of acoustic tracks 
to the snarling electric guitars, 
Blue picks up right where the 
band left off. 

“Check My Brain” and “A 
Looking in View” slide us right 
in, evoking alt-rock Sabbath 
with crunchy, dissonant riffs. 
DuVall includes enough of 
AIC’s signature growl to keep 

the band’s cult following sat-
isfied on “Check My Brain” 
— and over a decade removed 
from grunge’s heyday, it still 
works. Just like Nirvana, AiC 
can’t help but trade electric 
acoustic — and damn it all if 
that doesn’t work, too. 

The title track (and the 
album’s coda) is AIC’s farewell 
to Stanley; the band sends him 
out bobbing gently down the 
river on a pillow-soft palan-
quin.

Apart from scattered bouts 
of formulaic grunge, Blue bal-
ances the old with the new 
almost flawlessly. And if you 
crank the album up loud 
enough and headbang from 
black to blue, you have the 
pleasure of forgetting what 
decade it is.

Wu-Tang’s 
Nastiest 
Saves the 
Clan from 
Obscurity. 
By Simone 
Wilson

W ith typically terrible Wu-Tang timing, Clan sta-ples Raekwon and Ghostface 
Killah have both decided to 
release new, all-original LPs this 
September. The former hits us with 
the long-anticipated follow-up 
to 1995 cult favorite Only Built 4 
Cuban Linx… — a landmark that 
bossy Wu beatmaker RZA has 
been wolf-crying for years — and 
Ghostface dives off the deep end 
for good, into a maple-syrup pud-
dle of pure R&B, hilariously named 

Ghostdini: The Wizard of Poetry in 
Emerald City.

Ghost’s theme (which doesn’t 
really hold up past cover art) is so 
awful to be almost endearing: Badly 
photoshopped ’90s babes sink into 
fields of poppies lining the yellow 
brick road, watched over by a float-
ing emerald-lit Ghostdini — a scene 
apparently wheeze-cackle brain-
stormed over a family-room grav-
ity bong with the kids. (Question: 
What does Houdini have to do with 
“The Wizard of Oz”?)

His R&B beats, appropriately, 
have never been cheesier, but they’re 
also deep and sticky. Poetry ain’t 
all perfume and petals: “Stapleton 
Sex” narrates the nastiest fuck since 
“Strawberry,” leaving out nary a hair 
on Mrs. Killah’s pussy. (But, ever the 
romantic, Ghost can only come after 
she tells him she loves him). Far from 
the outer-space weirdo on 2006’s 
Fishscale, the new Ghost is a shame-
less old fart with a pregnancy fetish

FILMREVIEW

The Truth Hurts — but ‘Lying’ Is Excruciating
By Jenna Brogan
Associate Hiatus Editor

W hether or not you proudly sport a “Team Jim and Pam” T-shirt, you have to admit that Ricky 
Gervais struck comedic gold when he 
created “The Office.” 

Sadly, even loyal Dunder 
Mifflinites will be disappointed by the 
Brit’s directing debut: “The Invention 
of Lying,” a comedy about what life 
would be like if everyone told the 
truth, and nothing but the truth. 

While it is an interesting idea, 
Gervais proves in a record five min-
utes that a world without omission 
is not a place you want to be  — nor 
does it make for a particularly inter-
esting trip to the movie theater. 

Immediately following the opening 
credits — in which we’re told exactly 
what is going to happen over the 
next 100 minutes — we meet Mark 
Bellison (Ricky Gervais), a sad excuse 
for a man. He’s broke, fat, single and 
about to be fired.

That description may seem a bit 
cruel. And it is. 

But “Lying” is all about exposing 
the harsh reality of how shallow, rac-
ist, sexist, horny and money-hungry 
we all apparently are.

See, since no one in this alternate 
reality has the ability to lie, interper-
sonal communication is no more 
than each individual’s stream of con-
sciousness, out loud. 

Allow the screenplay to speak for 
itself:

When Mark picks up Anna 
(Jennifer Garner) for their first date, 
she admits with a straight face, “I was 
just masturbating.” 

Mark then responds with a 
simple, “That makes me think of your 
vagina.” 

‘Nuff said.

Now, back 
to the plot.

One day, 
Mark the loser 
gets out of a bind by telling the world’s 
first lie. How he manages to do this 
remains a mystery, but one lie leads 
to another as Mark capitalizes on his 
newfound ability, quickly accruing 
fame and fortune.

Things soon get complicated, 
though, when tales concocted by 
Mark’s imagination are accepted by the 
world as gospel truth and he is treated 
more like Moses than Brad Pitt.

If you can stomach the fact that 
Garner, who would more likely pass 
for 13 than 30, plays a perverted 

prima donna, 
and Jonah 
Hill, who can 
typically be 

relied on for comic relief, portrays a 
suicidal Debbie downer, you might 
find the film to be a multi-layered 
satire about everything wrong with 
American society. 

Coincidence that it shares an 
opening day with “Capitalism: A Love 
Story”? I think not. Still, all the layers 
of social commentary about consum-
erism, capitalism and morality in the 
world can’t hide the fact that the film 
is not at all funny. 

You’d think an award-winning 
screenwriter would milk this uncanny 

scenario for all its side-splitting worth, 
but instead of “Office” wit, the audi-
ence is force-fed dry humor that sub-
stitutes punch lines for insults that are 
just plain mean.

Tina Fey’s character even goes so 
far as to call Mark a “fat faggot.” Heh.

As a result, the only thing even 
mildly brow-raising about the film is 
the sheer number of celebrities that 
Gervais evidently tricked into cameos. 
Really? Edward Norton? 

While standing behind that shiny 
35-millimeter camera may have made 
for a nice holiday from Scranton, a 
word from the wise to Ricky Gervais:

Don’t quit your day job.
… That’s what she said.

and shopping-addicted American 
family to go fully green. 

An official selection at the 2009 
Sundance Film Festival, this low-
budget eye-opener intends to force 
viewers into questioning their own 
personal consumption habits and 
individual global impacts.

But Beaven finds out early on that 
the journey to Gore-esque nirvana 
has its share of not-so-obvious chal-
lenges — like when he has to convince 
his wife of the value of trekking their 
daughter up 24 flights of stairs instead 
of taking the elevator.

The family’s compost bin quickly 
fills with rotting food, earthworms 
bring mating flies into their home and 
Colin gets bombarded with blogger 
criticism about whether his project 
will have a real impact. Fights between 
him and Michelle about having a sec-
ond child put emotional weight on the 
already strenuous endeavor.

Yet in the midst of conflict, the 
film has the power to convince even 
the most pessimistic viewers that — at 
the risk of sounding cheesy — all crea-
tures in the world are connected. Who 
knows? Maybe it is possible to reduce 
our negative impact, change world-
views and save the planet after all. 

Unlike most biased, agenda-fueled 
documentaries, “Man” gives face time 
to supporters as well as critics with-
out sugar-coating the motives which 
inspired the experiment, including 
Beaven’s writing career. 

But all good intentions and crafty 
camera techniques aside, the year long 
experiment feels more like a decade by 
the film’s conclusion. And let’s be hon-
est: It’s no “Inconvenient Truth.”

���THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2009� HIATUS

the musty, 19th-century original. Vivid 
imagery in the script compensates for 
a static, minimalist set that reflects the 
play’s Victorian-era backdrop. 

Creditors never takes itself too seri-
ously, however; just as the bombs of 
marital jihad are about to explode, 
the play invites us to hide and chuckle 
behind the fort of clever puns and 
quick wordplay it employs. 

The play’s intricate web of entwined 
love stories is cleverly muddied by 
confusion over the true identity of the 
creditor and the debtor in all three rela-
tionships. 

Adolf — epileptic and invalid by 
the end of the play  — is Tekla’s credi-
tor by virtue of having sacrificed both 
his physical and spiritual self to please 
her. At the same time, however, he 
finds himself in debt to Tekla because 
she nurtured him (implicit even in her 
nickname for Adolf: “little brother.”)

It is in the midst of this confusion 
that our sympathies for the characters 
waver, but raw performances from 
the three-person cast rarely falters in 

grounding us with its palpability. Omar 
Metwally offers a nuanced portrayal 
of the distressed Adolf  — fully in love 
and snared by his conflicting emotions 
of desperation, elation and jealousy. 
Kathryn Meisle, as the devilishly slut-
tish Tekla, somehow evokes pity for the 
vilified wife as T. Rider Smith effort-
lessly renders Gustav — the despicable 
misogynist who transforms into a 
prude sycophant.  

Reflecting playwright August 
Strindberg’s own marital strife, the 
improbable storyline manages an air of 
unabashed honesty. Creditors confronts 
us with a morbid and gloomy take on 
marriage, suggesting that the institution 
imprisons, emasculates and kills.

Whether we agree with Strindberg 
or not, one thing’s for certain; Creditors 
is no Taylor Swift fairytale. 

When Adolf reveals a nude sculp-
ture of Tekla as a manifestation of his 
obsession in the first act, Gustav taunts 
him by deriding the art of sculpting as 
a crude way of “conveying complexity 
without color and nuisance.” The play, 
ironically, does just that.

and a paisley-robed potbelly. Nothing 
is too ordinary — stretch marks, back 
pains, dirty boxers, toe-sucks nor dicks 
hard as calluses  — to earn a mention in 
this interlude-free stretch of bumpers 
to hump your old lady by.

Across the board, fans and critics 
agree that Cuban Linx… Pt. II is as 

masterly a sequel as we could have 
hoped from the Chef. Tight-wound 
beats are Wu-brand dungeon antique, 
Raekwon’s dragon flow is fire-tight 
— “Blood squirted, look like laundry 
detergent, the dread fell out/ Right 
from there, he gon’ need a surgeon”  
— as are top-form guest spots from 
Inspectah Deck to Beanie Sigel.

But Linx’ highlights are undeniably 
the eight whopping Ghostface cameos, 
stanking of the same whiney, finely aged 
perviness that makes Emerald City so 
hot. His raps are pillared by vintage Wu 
but made to soar with a sense of new-
age self-realization — single-handedly 
driving the Shaolin grandfathers into a 
the next century of greatness.

of groups that lace poppy dance 
music under lyrics of heartbreak. 
Similar to Ra Ra Riot, but with a 
flatter aesthetic, the trio ends up 
a less psychedelic, decidedly less 
inspired MGMT.

Serving as frontman to the mel-
low, lo-fi and all-around depress-
ing band Sexton Blake — which 
featured song titles to the tune of 
“Better off Dead” and “Want to 
Die” — songwriter Josh Hodges 
became dissatisfied by the band’s 
lifeless concerts and created 
Starfucker in 2007. Joined by Ryan 
Bjornstad and Shawn Glassford on 
stage, Hodges’ live performances 
couldn’t be further from his Sexton 
days.

The stage is where Starfucker 
shines, transforming weak record-
ings into robust hits. These skinny 
guys from Portland are weird in a 
great way — although you could 
never tell it from their albums 
— sometimes opting to show up 
wardrobed by an ’80s hip-hop show 
(think neon bomber jackets, over-
sized glasses, fresh hi-tops and fat 
gold chains). Band members jump 
rapidly between a variety of instru-
ments, with Bjornstad spending a 
significant amount of time on the 
ones and twos, and replace stale 
samples with superior live instru-
mentation.

Most importantly, the synth-
heavy tracks are known for spur-
ring the entire room into an all-
out, seething sweaty dance-party — 
appropriate for a group that got its 
start playing cramped house shows. 
The verbosely named, guitar-based 
“Rawnald Gregory Erickson the 
Second” of Target commercial 
semi-fame is enough to get the 
crowd moving, while the up-tem-
po, scratch-laden “Medicine” might 
even get it rowdy. Performing at 
the Loft should work to Starfucker’s 
advantage; the confined space was 
made for a crowded, sweaty (albeit 
snooty) experience.

hoofing it all the way back until we hit 
the buzz-heavy Ike’s Place for glorious 
sandwiches. We must’ve walked a good 
10 miles that morning. When we got 
back to April’s, a few of us took catnaps 
to prep for the madness to come. 

That night, at least 70 people were 
shuffling in and out of her place, peeing 
on her neighbor’s back door (because 
the bathrooms were occupied) and 
crowd-surfing in her living room to our 
friends Koalacaust. The cops rolled up 
multiple times to shine Maglites in our 
faces, but — thankfully — the party 
was never shut down. An even bigger 
miracle: We didn’t find a single broken 
item the next morning.

After gathering our thoughts and 
belongings amid the alcoholic debris, 
we took off across the Bay Bridge to 
Oakland and met up with our friends 
Sarah, Jordan and Bones, who were 
residing in an art space/crack den of 
a house. We had time to kill, so we 
unloaded and then cruised to the 

theater to catch “District 9” — a much-
needed break before the night’s festivi-
ties. The Oakland show was undoubt-
edly the wackiest of the tour: Sloppy 
kids slammed into each other, into 
walls, busting holes in said walls and 
then passing out on the carpet. Pretend 
roll-bounced when the madness set 
in, crashing back in SF at a motel. We 
were concerned there wouldn’t even 
be a clean spot for us to claim on the 
ground; random German friends of 
Sarah’s had already called the best 
bedroom. We even debated leaving for 
Portland at 2 a.m. that night and taking 
turns at the wheel until morning. 

In the end, we just manned up and 
got cozy with each other. When I woke 
up at 7 a.m. to go pee, there was a dude 
passed out on the linoleum kitchen 
floor and one in the hallway. Like so, 
we took off for Oregon. What would 
we find in Weed, California? Would 
we gang-fight local Portland band, the 
Hugs? What is Burgerville? Find out in 
next week’s thrilling conclusion.

only 25 shots during the game. 
Coyote junior forward Albert 

Cabrera scored the game’s only goal  
— his seventh of the season — to 
beat UCSD. 

Akman again played well as keep-
er, recording five saves — four of 
which came in the first half. The sec-
ond half saw virtually no offense, as 
each goalkeeper made only one save 
apiece. Senior midfielder Kyle Parton 
was the Tritons’ lone offensive stand-
out, finishing with three shots on goal. 

“Other than San Bernadino’s goal, 
the game was pretty even,” senior 
midfielder Jonathan Sawyer said. “A 
lot of our games tend to be low scor-
ing, so winning often comes down to 
whichever team can finish chances.”

Despite ending their weekend road 
trip with only one win, the Tritons 
improved their offense and now look 
to play strong as a team throughout 
the upcoming homestand.

“For the past few games our team 
motto has been ‘stick together,’ which 
basically means no matter what hap-
pens, we stay together as a team and 
work hard for each other and for the 
UCSD logo on our jerseys,” senior 
forward Tony Choi said. “With a bit of 
tuning up this week, I am confident we 
will be fully prepared to take on one of 
the best teams in the nation on Friday.”

UCSD will try to maintain their 
home winning streak on Friday, Oct. 
2, where it will host No. 7 Sonoma 
State st a scheduled start time of 4:30 
p.m. The Seawolves are undefeated 
this season, with a record of 7-0-2 
overall and 4-0-1 in the CCAA. The 
Tritons will then host Humboldt State 
on Sunday, Oct. 4

Enlow and unleashed a shot. 
Though the Cal Poly Pomona 

goalkeeper blocked her kick, 
Hernandez came up with the 
rebound and proceeded to rocket the 
ball into the back of the net. The goal 
was Hernandez’s third of the season.

“Her shot was perfect,” Armstrong 
said. “It was well-placed and [made] 
with perfect timing.”

Defense was critical in the Triton 
victory. With less than a minute left in 
the first period, the Broncos were down 
a goal but kept steady 
pressure on UCSD. Cal 
Poly made a strong push 
across the field, attempt-
ing to tie the match in 
the closing seconds. The 
Broncos took a shot but 
Armstrong made a criti-
cal save, maintaining the 
1-0 Triton lead with only 
nine seconds left in the 
half.

“If the ball comes 
down to my side of 
the field, I have to 
keep everything out,” 
Armstrong said. “One 
goal can really matter.”

Cal Poly Pomona applied most 
of its pressure during the first 
half, outshooting the Tritons 11-5. 
Armstrong’s save late in the first half 
appeared to have deflated the Broncos’ 
morale and halted their momentum: 
Not only did the Tritons hang on 
for a victory, but also controlled the 
tempo in the second half with an 8-2 
shot advantage. Armstrong tallied a 
career-high eight saves to earn her 
first shutout as a Triton.

Head coach Brian McManus said 
he was proud of his goalkeeper’s play 
in the key CCAA match.

“She’s playing tremendously well,” 
McManus said. ”She has great con-
centration and so much confidence.”

UCSD continued its winning 
ways with a 2-0 victory over Cal 

State San Bernardino two days later, 
on Sept. 27. Each team displayed 
solid defense in the first half, and no 
goals were made on either side. 

However, the ever-resourceful 
Tritons took advantage of two accu-
rate corner-kick restarts late in the 
second half to defeat the Coyotes.

“When it is 0-0, the most important 
thing is to keep a clean slate and not get 
scored on,” sophomore midfielder and 
team captain Anne Wethe said. “Our 
offense is strong enough to score, but 
the most important thing is to keep 

them out of our net.”
Freshman defend-

er Ellen Wilson gave 
UCSD the 1-0 lead in 
the 69th minute, when 
she knocked in the ball 
off of a corner kick from 
senior midfielder Alexia 
Zatarain. Less than six 
minutes later, Wethe 
headed a second goal off 
of a corner kick from 
sophomore Sara Bolton. 
For both Wilson and 
Wethe, the goals were 
their second of the sea-
son.

“It was a really great 
corner from Sarah Bolton in the 
right place,” Wethe said. “It was a 
pretty easy knock-in.”

The Tritons outshot the Coyotes 
14-10 during the match. Armstrong 
had another strong performance, post-
ing five saves and recording her second 
consecutive shutout of the season.

UCSD returns home to play 
Sonoma State on Oct. 2. The 
Seawolves are 4-4-2 overall and 
2-2-2 in CCAA.

“We have to keep playing like we 
have been playing,” Wethe said. “Our 
best is better than any other’s best. So 
if we can just keep our heads in the 
game and play hard, we will do well.”

MEN’S SOCCER — A cluster of tie games 
and low-scoring matches has plagued UCSD 
so far this season, due in large part to a domi-
nant defense and dormant attack. However, the 
Tritons stepped up their offensive performance 
on the road last week against Cal Poly Pomona, 
securing a 1-0 victory on Sept. 25.  

UCSD was unable to retain Friday’s 
momentum at Cal State San Bernardino on 
Sept. 27, losing 1-0 to the Coyotes.  The week-
end split leaves the Tritons with an overall 
record of 4-2-4 (1-2-3 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association).

The lone goal of Friday’s game at Cal Poly 
Pomona came in the 23rd minute, off the leg of 
junior midfielder Kasra Sarabakhsh, in his first 

season on the UCSD team. After receiving a pass 
from junior midfielder David Bakai, Sarabakhsh 
drove the ball up the left side and booted it past 
Cal Poly Pomona senior goalkeeper Thomas 
Ryan. The assist was Bakai’s third of the season;  
he continues to deliver outstanding plays in the 
midfield. 

Despite being outshot 20-11, the Tritons 
managed to use a more balanced attack to fend 
off the Broncos. 

Senior goalkeeper Peter Akman was out-
standing between the posts, collecting four 
saves for his 17th career shutout. The Broncos 
applied most of the pressure in the second 
half, during which Akman stopped three of 
four shots on goal. 

“We were a lot sharper defensively against 
Pomona, which made the difference,” senior 
forward Tony Choi said. “Our keeper, Peter 
Akman, made a few very difficult and crucial 
saves that kept us in the game to beat Pomona. 
Other than that, we have had problems offen-
sively. We seem to be lacking a bit of energy and 
creativity in the offensive third, and that has 
been keeping us from scoring goals.”

On Sept. 27, UCSD traveled to play Cal State 
San Bernadino in a match between the No. 3 
and No. 4 teams in the CCAA. Friday’s low-
scoring trend continued against Cal State San 
Bernardino: The Tritons and Coyotes totaled

WOMEN’S SOCCER — UCSD 
recently capped a stretch of five con-
secutive road matches, with a 1-0 
victory at Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 
25 and a 2-0 win at Cal State San 
Bernardino on Sept. 27. The two 
wins improved the Tritons’ record to 
7-2 and 5-2 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play. 

The Tritons finished the road trip 
by winning four of five matches. The 
only loss on the trip was a 2-0 defeat 
at the hands of Chico State on Sept. 
20. The loss against their CCAA 
rival also knocked the Tritons out 
of the National Soccer Coaches 
Association of America rankings for 
the first time this season.

“It’s always important to rebound 
after losses,” sophomore goalkeeper 
Kristin Armstrong said. “We had 
more than a bit of fire built up from 
that loss.”

The contest against Cal Poly 
Pomona was defined by a dominant 
Triton defense that — aside from 
shutting out the opposing Broncos 
— held Pomona to a mere eight 
shots on goal. UCSD’s one goal was 
enough to squeeze out a victory. 

The match was scoreless until 
the 32nd minute, when freshman 
forward Gabi Hernandez came 
through with a thrilling goal that 
would hold up to win the game. 
Hernandez skillfully fought her 
way through the Cal Poly defense 
and positioned herself in front of 
the net. She then received the ball 
from freshman midfielder Alexa

MEN’S GOLF — Heading into the 
Western Washington Invitational on 
Sept. 28,  head coach Mike Wydra  
was already comfortable with his top 
three golfers, but didn’t know who 
would fill the fourth and fifth spots 
on the roster. 

Sophomore Michael Tilghman 
may have just earned himself one 
of those spots with his play at the 
Invitational. Tilghman totaled seven-
over-par for the three rounds, earn-
ing him a tie for 35th. 

As a team, UCSD finished 10th 
overall.

Tilghman was an unlikely pick 
heading into the season-opening 
tournament, as he had competed in 
only one tournament last season. 

“I felt like I had a lot to prove this 
year,” Tilghman said. “I didn’t really 
play that well last year, but I put in a 
lot of practice and hard work during 
the offseason. I put a big emphasis 
on ball-striking, which was a big 
problem for me last year.”

His improvement became appar-
ent when Tilghman hit 16 of 18 
greens in the second round, en 
route to a one-over-par 73. Despite a 
career-best performance, Tilghman  
believed he could have gone even 
lower.

“I didn’t putt well all three 
rounds,” Tilghman said. “I figured 
if I could hit a lot of greens, I could 
make a lot of birdies and a few pars, 
but my putting kept me from going 
low. I had about three to seven more 
putts in each round than I usually 
do.”

Trouble on the greens aside, 
Tilghman’s perfor-
mance left an impres-
sion on Wydra. 

“We need to find the 
right players, and the 
right pieces at the right 
time,” he said. “Keith 
and Raj are playing 
well, Richard adds a lot 
and it looks promising 
with Tilghman step-
ping up.”

But the five-man 
roster isn’t set in stone. 
Before each event, play-
ers compete to earn a 
spot on the final roster 
for the upcoming tour-
nament. Wydra said 
the two golfers with the 
lowest stroke totals in 
practice earn an auto-
matic spot alongside his three top 
picks.

Though the 10th-place finish was 
a disappointing start to the season, 
the Tritons were competing with-

out junior college transfer Richard 
Morris, their No. 1 recruit. He had 
issues with the NCAA clearinghouse 
— a necessary step to becoming an 
eligible student athlete. 

“The NCAA clearinghouse wasn’t 
able to clear Richard to play in 
time,” team captain and junior Keith 
Okasaki said. “He should be ready to 

travel to Chico in two 
weeks.”

When Morris is 
able to join the lineup, 
he will do so behind 
current No. 1 and 
No. 2 players Okasaki 
and senior Raj Samra, 
respectively. Okasaki 
finished two strokes 
behind Tilghman, 
while Samra came 
in six strokes behind 
Tilghman. 

Neither player was 
happy about his tour-
nament play.

“I played about as 
bad as I could have 
through the first two 
rounds,” Okasaki said. 
“I just had to grind it 

out and salvage something.”
Samra, on the other hand, was 

admittedly rusty after not competing 
much throughout the summer, due 
to problems obtaining his Southern 

California playing card.
The team was off to a shaky-start 

in its first competition of the season. 
While many players had practiced 
in individual tournaments over the 
summer, they weren’t able to do so in 
a team format. 

For the Tritons, the challenge 
became adapting from an individual 
to a team-oriented mindset.

“No matter what the team’s doing, 
you have to keep battling through,” 
Tilghman said. “You have four other 
guys depending on you, and you 
have to grind it out if you are having 
a bad round. In individual tourna-
ments, you can get a few bogeys and 
get down on yourself, but you can’t 
do that in team golf. It’s not just you 
out there.”

With some early rust shaken off, 
players will get back on the course 
Sept. 30, Oct. 5 and Oct. 7 to try and 
qualify for the tournament roster 
that will travel to the Chico State 
Invitational. 

Wydra is confident that as the 
season progresses, scores will con-
tinue to improve.

“We’re in the early development 
of the year,” Wydra said. “I expect us 
to have under-par totals throughout 
the year. We have plenty of talent.”
