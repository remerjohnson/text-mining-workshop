Physicist 
Seaborg 

• praises 
LBJ 
By SUSAN E. HYLEN 
SIll/! Wrltn 

Glenn Sea borg, winner of the 
1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry 
and chairman of the Atomic 
Energy Commission (AEC) 
under three U.S. administra-
tions, praised ex-president Lyn-
don Johnson's efforts at arms-
control negotiations in a faculty 
seminar lecture last Monday. 

"I don't think it is generally 
understood how much was ac-
complished during Lyndon John-
son's presidency," Sea borg said, 
pointing out that Johnson is 
remembered mostly for the Viet-
nam War and the Great Society. 

Seaborg, who was retained by 
Johnson after President Ken-
nedy's death as the chairman of 
the AEC, detailed Johnson's 
efforts to adopt a treaty to 
prevent the spread of nuclear 
weapons. 

Sea borg said that after Ken-
nedy', death, Johuon', "main 
agenda WII the cutback of fIS-
sionable material ... a politically 
explo~ive issue" that Kennedy 
had been willing to postpone 
until after the coming elections. 

The policy was important for 
safety reasons, he continued, but 
controversial because of the 
expected unemployment caused 
by decreasing production of 
plutonium and enriched uranium-
235. Johnson decided that the 
pr-oblem "had nothing to do with 
the election," and dealt with it as 
one of his fint steps in office, 
according to Seabor •. 

Seaborg also related the ob-
stacles Johnson faced in seeking

the signing of the Non-Prolifera-
tion Treaty (NPT), including the 
alternative concept of a multi-
lateral (multi-nation) force 
(MLF) within NATO. A com-
bined force was advocated by 
many allies as a control over 
nuclear forces, but according to 
Sea borg, the Soviet Union was 
very opposed to the Germans 
having "a finger on the nuclear 
trigger ... 

Sea borg said the issue even-
tually came to a choice for 
Johnson between a multi-lateral 

force and a non-proliferation 
treaty. In 1966, Johnson an-
nounced that the NPT was to be 
given top priority. 

Further delay occurred be-
cause of the arguments that 
inspection of peaceful nuclear 
facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
could lead to leakage of commer-
cial secrets, Sea borg said. 

He explained that some Euro-
pean countries wanted to initiate

Radical reforms 
are contemplated 
by Bio department 
By J. BERESFORD-HOWE 

Spurred by a professor who 
was angry over troubles that his 
undergraduate T As had been 
getting credit for classes taken at 
other universities, the biology 
department is nearing a radical 
reform of its advising and transfer 
policies. 

Among the changes under 
consideration: 

• Elimination of the Biology 
One, Two and Three require-
ment; the classes would become 
"highly recommended," not man-
datory. 

• Full credit for basic biology, 
physics and math classes taken 
at other universities; currently, 
the department rarely gives stu-
dents credit for studies elsewhere. 

• A shift in the advising 
system which would assign all 
students to a faculty advisor but 
allow any faculty member to 
advise any student. Students now 
mostly see a staff advisor when 
tryina to transfer credits nom 
other univenities or departments. 

• Institution of orientation 
sessions for transfer students. 

• According to biology Pro-
fessor Milton Saier and Depart-
ment Chair Richard Dutton, a 
consensus for these changes 
emerged at an a\l-day biology 
department meeting Saturday, 
May 7. 

"The changes will be very much 
along the lines of what we talked 
about at the meeting," Dutton 
said. 

A final list of recommendations 
based on that meeting and subject 
to approval of the entire faculty 

was considered yesterday and 
today by the department's Under-
graduate Curriculum Committee. 

Saier is primarily responsible 
for bringing the debate to the 
department. 

"It came to my attention sitting 
aroun~ with my T As," Saier says. 

"Every single one of them had 
horror stories about problems 
with the advising system and 
getting credits. One excellent 
student who was a T A for Bio 
One was taking that class his last 
quarter here because he couldn't 
get credit from another school," 
Saier says. 

Saier says he talked with other 
Biology Department faculty and 
found similar stories. Irritated , 
he compiled a case history docu-
menting fifteen students' cases, 
each highly critical of the de-
partment's communications with 
its students. 

'1The staff advisor] seemed 
almost happy in informing me 
that I would have to take another 
ph, ... and math course ... I had 
already taktn a year sequence of 
both," one student told Saier. 
"They do not give a damn about 
me." 

Another student, attempting 
to transfer a Genetics class from 
Ohio State, reported that, "the 
advice to me seemed to suggest 
the lack of hope in even trying to 
'submit a petition to transfer 
credits ... [the advisor] told me 
that nobody has ever been able 
to transfer [their] class, not even 
from a UC system school." 

URI defense funding cap eliminated . 
"One of our real problems," 

Biology Department Chairman 
Richard Dutton acknowledges, 
"is a lack of communication 
between students and faculty." 

There are no students on 
biology department curriculum 
committees. Still, Dutton defends 
the informal gathering of student 
opinion as a legitimate method 
of student' input. 

Dr. Henry 0 .1. Abarbanel is 
optimistic about the future : "It 
will be business as usual. We 
are expecting 80 percent of [the 
funds that] we are requesting 
for 1989." Other researchers 
are worried, however, and do 
not feel that funds will be so 
forthcoming. 

But researchers 
feel money 
will be tight 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
SIll/! Wrltn 

Although the 14 percent geo-
graphical cap the University 
Research Initiative (URI) under 
the Department of Defense 
(DOD) was overturned by the 
House of Representatives for 
fiscal year 1989, UCSD research-
ers are skeptical about receiving 
sufficient funds next year. 

The recent legislation is a direct 
result of the congressional lobby-
ing efforts of UC and other 
university scientists, researchers 
and administrators. The earlier 
bill, passed in December of 1987, 
had placed a 14 percent limit on 
URI funds available to anyone 
state, will now only affect re-
search through this year. 

The cap was arbitrarily based 
on the state with the greatest 
number of scientific and engineer-
ing doctoral graduates - Calif-

ornia, which has 13.2 percent. 
The result was an 57.3 million 
cut in URI funding to UC 
campuses for fiscal year 1988. 
Because the DOD funding is the 
main source for basic science 
research at universities, this left 
many university research pro-
jects, especially in California, 
hanging in limbo. 

Now, next year's disbursement 
of DOD funding to UCSD and 
other universities will be admin-
istered solely by congress in the 
context of their efforts to try t 
balance the federal budget . 

Dr. Henry D.1. Abarbanel, a 
UCSD scientist and the principal 
investigator for one of the groups 
that received a URI grant, testi-
fies before a house subcommittee 
two months ago about the 
harmful effects of the cap. After 
hearing the news he is optimistic 
about the future: "Next year URI 
funds will be shared by all 
states. .. it will be business as 
usual. We are expecting 80 
percent of[the fund that] we are 
requesting for fiscal 1989." 

Other scientists, such as Geoff 
Vallis, a research meteorologist 

at Scripps, are still very pessi-
mistic about whether there will 
be enough funds to renew the 
projects tht were mothballed this 
year as a result of the cap. "We 
don't know where we are going 
' 0 get funds for next year because 
of the lack of stability of DOD 
funding." Vallis said. 

The idea behind the URI grants 
was to provide stable funding for 
five years. However, according 
to Abarbanel, even with the cap 
lifted there is still no guarantee 
that the research programs will 
get the amount of funds needed 
to pay the technicians and 
research scientists or buy the 
materials for the research pro-
jects. • 

To compound the problem, 
"the University takes off 40 to 45 
percent of the URI funds for 
overhead costs," Vallis said. "We 
are requesting that the overhead 
be waived, but that has not been 
approved . We don't know where 
we are going to get funds for next 
year." 

There were II UC research 
programs directly affected this 

See DEFENSE, pale 7 

"We have become aware in the 
last few weeks that the method 
for advising and transferring 
credits is not satisfactory and in 
some cases is quite unsatisfac-
tory," Dutton says. "Student

UCSD Neurobiologists awarded 53.3 
million to investigate nervous systems 

Six UCSD biologists were awarded a $3 .3 million 
National Institute of Health grant to investigate the 
molecular basis of nerve cell signaling that underlies 
all thought and behavior. 

The three-year award, called a Program Project 
grant, will support coordinated studies in each of six 
department of biology laboratories, and provide cen-
tralized facilities for computer analysis, instrumen-
tation and other services. 

Each study will focus on a different nervous sys-
tem, from those of leeches and lobsters to frogs and 
fruit flies. 

klnvertebrates have traditionally been studied 
because their nerve cells are very large and identifia-
ble, and the nerve circuits underlying their simple 
behaviors can provide models for more complex 
patterns of neural activity such as thought," ~ccord­
ing to Allen 1. Selverston, professor of biology and 
director of the Neurobiology Program Project. 
'This is very fundamental research aimed at reveal-
ing the way neurons process information at a cellu-
lar and molecular level." 

Dr. David Bailey named chair 
of U CSD Pathology Department 

David N. Bailey, M.D .. professor of pathology at 
the UCSD School of Medicine, was appointed chair 
of the department of pathology. Bailey has served as 
acting chair of the department since August 1986. 
He succeeds former chair Peter W. Lampert, M.D., 
who died in July 1986. 

In addition to his duties as chair, Bailey will con-
tinue to serve as head of the division of laboratory 
medicine, director of clinical laboratories and direc-
tor oft he toxicology la boratory at U CS 0 Medical Center. 

" We are delighted that after a national search, the 
best qualified individual was found in the UCSD 
department of pathology," said Gerard N. Burrow, 
M.D ., vice chancellor for health sciences and dean 
of the School of Medicine. "Dr. Bailey is an out-
standing example of the quality of the department. 
The recent advances in the 'new' biology are revolu-
tionizing diagnostic pathology, and Dr. Bailey is 
eminently suited to lead this revolution." 

Bailey says the field of pathology will continue to 
playa significant role in many areas of medicine. 

.. As a basic medical science, pathology continues 
to playa strong role in both research and clinical 
laboratory arenas, especially in light of advances 
being made in molecular biology," Bailey said . 

Bailey has appointed professor Charles Davis,

sored by California Western School of Law and the 
San Diego County Bar Association. The discussion 
is open to the public. Seating is limited. Fees are 515 
for the general public and 510 for students. 

Richard Armstrong to live 
lecture entitled "New Works" 

Richard Armstrong of New York City's Whitney 
Museum of American Art will deliver a public lec-
ture Monday, May 16 at the Lyceum Theatre in 
Horton Plaza, titled "New Works." 

In his role as co-curator of the Biennial, in the 
museum, Armstrong travels throughout the country 
seeking out the newest in American art and selecting 
the trends to be represented at the Biennial. 

While often controversial, not just for who is 
included, but also for who is omitted, the Biennial 
has come to be considered a showcase for emerging 
young artists. 

Armstrong's lecture is one in a continuing series of 
"Lectures at the Lyceum," presented by UCSD 
Extension. This particular lecture was made possible 
in part by a grant from the National Endowment for 
the Arts and is co-sponsored with The La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art and The La Jolla 
Museum Downtown. 

The lecture will take place at 7:30 p.m., Monday, 
May 16. Admission is S6 (54. SO for students and 
LJMCA members), and tickets may be purchased in 
advance by calling S34-3400 or at the door if space 
allows. 

The political film series to present 
file on America and the Cold War 

On Friday, May 13 at 7 p.m., the Committee for 
World Democracy will present "Are we Winning, 
Mommy? America and the Cold War." The film is 
an exploration of the roots of the cold war era and 
its effects on American life. . 

Using images and historical footage from the Uni-
ted States and Europe, the film supports the thesis 
that war is not inevitable, but is rather constructed 
by various people, ideologies, fear and actions. The 
film is free and will be presented in TLH 107.

The A.S. unanimously allo-
cated 5540 in transportation costs 
to send 18 U CS 0 st udents to the 
Educational Rights conference 
at Stanford next week.end at last 
night's council meeting. 

The budget allocation was 
given to third world student 
organizations and the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
to send their group representa-
tives to promote their state-wide 
agendas on educational rights 
and equity. 

In Items of Immediate Consi-
deration, Tina Maher was ap-
pointed as student at large to the 
Finance Committee; Gayatri 
Gunasekaran to the Rules Com-

mittee. and Tom Rhee as student 
at large to the Rules Committee. 

In announcements Mordecai 
Potash, vice president of External 
Affairs discussed issues that were 
covered at the latest University 
of California Student Association 
Conference in Santa Cruz. The 
UCSD conference representatives 
reported that the state legislature 
had reached an agreement over a 
17 percent increase in Cal Grant 
B awards and for more money 
for affirmative action programs. 

"[Passage of these proposals] 
is threatened by a billion dollar 
shortfall in the state budget," 
Potash said. 

In other announcements, there 
will be an all-campus tie-dye 
festival from noon to 4 pm this 
Monday at Revelle college with 
music and a barbecue.

which he thinks divide opinion 
on biology department policy, 
he asked that the department 
take the issue up at its spring 
quarter meeting. 

Saier's letter got some biology 
department members angry, but 
got an "about time" from others.

professor say. "Don't worry

Hunter S. Thompson 
Greedy Foxes 

W ell , folks, let me tell you a story about the red fox , and how I came to know him. It is a tale of treachery and violence and vengeance rarely encountered in a family newspaper - or 
even by me , in my own life, which has not been entirely free of these 
things. 

But even dumb brutes can learn, and 1 have long since quit even 
violence, which I used to enjoy as a sport (but that passed when I 
realized that not everybody feels that way, and some people want to 
hurt you.) 

Vengeance went the same way. It was fun to plot and to talk about, 
but tlle real thing required more time and energy than being saddled 
with a terminal disease, and not even best vengeance ever paid the 
rent. 

The English language is not crowded with words beginning with 
the letter "v" that suggest anything but trouble. After violence and 
vengeance, there is also vulgar, vicious, victim, vermin, vain, vacant, 
vile. vampire ... the list is long, with not a lot of smiles. 

Right. And never mind these arcane drifts of language. We will 
leave them to villains a nd vissmongers like Edwin Newman and 
Robin MacNeil. 

What are we talk ing a bout now is the hideous death in the life of a 
red fox, co ns idered by many experts to be one of the smartest beasts 
in nature. 

.. The fox has a distinct personality. His exceptional cunning. 
amounting sometimes almost to genius. has been responsible for 
many exaggerated stories of his extreme resouN;efulness . .. 

- New Hunters ' Encyclopedia, p. 14 

BUt not from me. T here is a whole nest of those vicious little red buggers about 200 yards across the field from my front porch , and I am now in the proces of killing them. I got the big one a 
few days ago and the others have gone into hiding. 

They went all to pieces when the old man finally returned from his 
last trip across the field . He was blind in both eyes and covered with a 
hard crust offeathers and peacock dung, and he was leavinga trail of 
blood from the stumps of his hind legs. 

h was midafternoon and the ca rrion birds were just beginning to 
think about feeding, but they were not in any hurry. There is no lack 
of food around here . The peacocks eat well - even at 20 below -
and so do all the scavengers. There is always pfenty of wheat-cracked 
corn and French fries . . . They will eat anything that bleeds. including 
their own kind, like sha rks in a feeding frenzy. If one of them gets 
wounded, he will be quickly devoured by the others. They eat the eyes 
and entrails first, and then they get into the meat. 

O n any market survey with a "chic scale"from one to 10, the red fox will run about eight. He is a very stylish little animal, with a neo-valuable pelt and a social cachet on the level of mean 
horses and fast dogs. 

On some farms they will settle for lesser prey, like the gray fox -
one of the lower and uglier strains in the Vulpes vulva family; it has 
eyes like warts and hair like the spines of a sea urchin, and a brain like 
a chicken on speed. 

There is also the coyote, which is hunted or at least chased now and 
then by gangs of nouveau riche huntsmen in places like Vail and 
Palm Springs ... But it is not quite the same, because the coyote 
always wins. 

He is not a vain little punk like the red rox, with its bitchy little 
temper and its pampered way of life. 

But I have never had a problem with coyotes, although the valley is 
full of them. In 15 years of relentless coexistence, not even a rabid 
coyote has ever come up on my front porch and killed one of my 
fa mily animals, or even chewed up one of the peacocks. 

The red fox has a different attitude . He was arrogant and greedy 
and rude, and somewhere along the line he developed a taste ~or 
Salisbury steak. He also killed the family cat and took to roammg 
brazenly in the yard and even up on my porch in broad daylight, 
sniffing around the peacock cage. 

The Hav-a-Hart trap is a heavy metal box about 4 feet long, with 
doors on both ends and a nice little food tray in the middle. When the 
animal gets far enough in to eat the Salisbury steak, both-doors clang 
shut ahd lock firmly. Escape is impossible. 

When Ifound the red fox in the cage I talked to him for a while as I 
prepared a mixture of feathers and peacock dung, which I then began 
shoveling through the bars and into the cage with him. The fox 
became hysterical as he thrashed around in the mess, trying to bite off 
the end of the shovel. Every once in a while I sprayed him with liquid 
glue and then a final shot of Mace in his eyes before I let him go . 

On his way across the field , the hideous , stinking half blind , 
brain-shattered animal had to pass between two yearling peacocks 
who were pecking around in the grass for bugs, payi ng no attention 
to this thing that they didn 't even recognize as a fox . 1 was stunned, 
however to see the fox veer off his course and make a kind of staggeri~g dumb-vicious pass at one of the birds. ~o I sho.t him from 
behind with a load of double-O buckshot to help him on hiS way. The 
last time I saw him he was cove red with blood and two huge red-
tailed hawks were circling overhead preparing to take him into the 
food chain. - By Hunter S. Thompson

Letters 

Jackson for 
President 
Editor: 

Jesse Jackson is a worthy 
ca ndidate for president and I will 
vote for him in the June primary. 

For the past 20 years, Jackson 
has demonstrated leadership and 
strength in his crusade for civil 
rights for. all people. Jackson's 
activities range from working 
with Martin Luther King in the 
1 960s through Operation PUSH 
in the 1970s, and through the 
1984 and 1988 presidential cam-
paigns. Through that time, Jesse 
Jackson has endured a lot of 
criticism, much of it unnecessary. 
But each time Jackson faces 
criticism, he overcomes his critics 
with flair and dignity. 

Jesse Jackson is a motivator. 
His oratory power leaves a strong 
impression on those who have 
heard him. He has the power to 
lift the spirits of old and young 
alike. His message of hope is 
especially encouraging to young 
people who have never really 
been able to relate to any presi-
dent since John F. Kennedy. 
Jackson realizes that the youth is 
our future. He wants to make 
sure they can grow up in a society 
that is free of drugs , and that has 
plenty of educational and oc-
cu pational opportunities for 
young people. 

Because Jackson realizes the 
im portance of the youth, he has 
effectively made them an issue in 
his campaign. Children need role 
models, and Jesse Jackson fits 
that personality. Jackson wants 
to make sure that all children 
have a positive attitude about 
themselves, especially when he 
encourages them to repeat the 
phrase: "I am somebody." 

Unfortunately, many people 
won't vote for somebody with 
little or no political experience. 
If that's the case, then why have

on target about some aspects of 
UCSD students' outlook on the 
sports program. 

But I think he expressed more 
disappointment that others 
don't see things his way than 
convinced the readers that they 
should behave differently, speci-
fically by attending UCSD inter-
collegiate athletic competitions. 

I think the UCSD Physical

OPINION 

Students, Bio Staff Aren't Tearing Down the Walls 
'How can the faculty, 
starr, or students support 
such a callous system? Is 
the bureaucratic machine 
going to subdue even the 
few remaining free 
thinkers?' 

By MILTON SAlEK 

UCSD was founded in an 
atmosphere of idealism, planned 
to maximize interaction between 
faculty and students. The Cam-
bridge College system was adopt-
ed; elitist facilities such as a 
faculty club were intentionally 
omitted from the master plan. h 
was felt that students and teach-
ers should live and learn together 
in an environment conducive to 
maximal intellectual exchange. 

During my early years at 
UCSD, the faculty assumed a 
variety of roles: those of research-
er, teacher, administrator, and 
adviser. Each of the three then 
existent colleges had its own 
theme, emphasis, courses, pro-
fessors, buildings, and student 
living quarters. A student inter-
ested in the natural sciences 
majored in biology, chemistry or 
physics. There were no formally 
designated subdisciplines. A 
student, together with his self-
chosen advising professor, would 
ponder his academic _ emphasis 
and select his curriculum. 

As the years passed, faculty 

members within the biology 
department decided that the stu-
dent would benefit from the exist-
ence of "concentration areas in 
biology" which would provide 
guidelines for students interested 
in particular disciplines. Gradu-
ally, college distinctions at UCSD 
began to fade, and the biology 
concentration areas evolved into 
major programs, each with its 
own emphasis, each with its own 
set of rigid graduation require-
ments. 

The administration of each 
major was handled by a group of 
professors with research inter-
ests in the particular subdisci-
pline. Somtimes a single profes-
sor assumed responsibility as the 
head while the others served as 
an advisory body. Eventually this 
"head" assumed the role of stu-
dent adviser for the group, al-
lowing the others to devote more 
time to their research, adminis-
tration, or other activities. 

One problem which arose from 
this new system was that the 
"head" was faced with far more 
advising responsibilities than any 
one professor had ever had 
before. In order to lighten his 
burden, a staff adviser was hired. 
That person was not required to 
be a professor, biologist, educa-
tor, psychologist, or college grad-
uate or have any knowledge of 
course content. 

A student could, of course, 
still consult a professor, but spe-
cial requests were increasingly 
handled by petition. The petition 
facilitated matters because when 

the Major professor-adviser was 
out of town or otherwise occu-
pied, another faculty member 
could substitute merely by si~n­
ing the petition. Eventually, the 
adviser saw very few students, 
and student matters were more 
often than not handled by peti-
tion. 

To facilitate the review pro-
cess, the staff adviser would fre-
quently place an "X" in the ap-
propriate place, indicating whe-
ther she felt the petition should 
be approved or disapproved. If 
the faculty adviser was in a hurry, 
his daily advising tasks could 
then be completed within a 10-
minute period. No one ever 
seemed to complain, so it was 
concluded that the new method 
was satisfact ory. 

After returning from my sab-
baticalleave last year and while 
teaching upper division Bio-
chemistry (Bio JO 1), 1 was sur-
prised to learn that one of my 
teaching assistants was taking 
lower division Biology (Bio 1) 
concurrently. Subsequently , I 
learned that three exceptional 
transfer students who were con-
ducting research in my laboratory 
3nd who had completed several 
of their upper division biology 
courses at UCSD were similarly 
being required to take Bio 1. 

Something seemed wrong. 
Wasn't Bio 1 supposed to be a 
prerequisite, rather than a post-
requisite for upper division bio-
logy? Careful examination of 
departmental policy revealed 
that an inflexible, hard-nosed 

Dr. Mil ton Saier 

approach, implemented by a few 
professors, was responsible. I sent 
a memorandum to the chairman 
of the departmental undergrad-
uate curriculum committee, to 
the departmental chairman, and 
to the staff adviser, objecting to 
this practice, but the memo was 
ignored. Inertia is hard to over-
come. 

At a student research meeting, 
one of my undergraduate trans-
fer students described his frus-
tration in trying to get his trans-
fer credits from Foothill College 
accepted by the biology depart-
ment. Although he had taken a 
year of math, a year of physics 
and a year of lower division 
biology at Foothill College and 
had gotten straight A's in his 
upper division biology courses at 
at UCSD, the staff adviser had 

NOW THRU SUNDAY 

unequivocally informed him that 
he must repeat the third quarter 
of math, the third quarter of 
physics, and Bio I to graduate. 
He was not informed of the 
existence of advising professors 
or an appeal process. 

Convinced of the rigor of his 
Foothill program, he decided to 
research the corresponding cour-
ses at UCSD. Books and chap-
ters were compared, and he dis-
covered that although the ma-
terials were not identical, overlap 
was extensive, equivalent 
amounts of material had been 
covered, and the degree of intel-
lectual challenge had been com-
parable . He was incensed, but he 
didn't know to whom he should 
turn. 

Incited by this example, the 
other transfer students in the 
Sunday research discussion 
group began airing their griev-
ances. As each one in turn told 
his or her story, my blood pres-
sure rose. , was appalled to learn 
that everyone had justifiable 
grievances but that most had 
accepted their plight without 
challenging the decision con-
veyed by the staff adviser. Not 
one of these seven students has 
seen a faculty adviser or even 
knew of the existence of such a 
person. None had been informed 
of their options.

ors criticize his meetings with 
Yasser Arafat and Louis rar-
rakahn, and accuse him of being 
anti-semitic. Critics also assail 
him for being a "maverick" or 
"macho" when he negotiated the 
release of Lt. Robert Goodman 
from Syria in 1984. 

I feel that t he incide nt s men-
tio ned above are irrelevant to 
this year's campaign, though. The 
murde r of King took place 20 
years ago, and it does not matter 
if Jackson was there or not . It 
does matter that Jackso n has 
said that King was "my father 
figure, my brother figure , and 
my teacher." 

Jackson's meetings with Arafat 
and Farrakhan were in 1979 and 
1984, respectively, not 1988. 
Jackson has effectively avoided 
mentioning those two figures this 
year. Furthermore, Jackson is 
not anti-semitic and he has since 
apologized for his off-the-record 
remark about the Jews and New 
York City. 

Finally, as for t he rescue of Lt. 
Goodman, this incident shows 

.~ ... 

that Jackson does not hesitate in 
taking action, and that he is not 
afraid to communicate with other 
parties concerning the welfare of 
fellow Americans and for peace 
in the Middle East. 

Undoubtedly, some people will 
tilljudge Jackson by his record, 

but if that's the case, so be it. 
Jesse Jackson has done much 
more good than harm (if any) in 
his past, and I fee l that that is 
something to be commended . 

Jesse Jackson has my vote for 
theJune primary. I firmly believe 
that the issues he stands for , such 
as doubling federal funding for 
education, building homes for 
the homeless, providing for a 
national healthcare system, and 
figh ting to keep jobs for Ameri-
cans, will help this country tre-
mendously. 

l OW, I will not criticize George 
Bush or Mike Dukakis for their 
views, but I highly praise Jessc 
Jackson. I feel it's time for a 
change, and that is why I want

Forces operate to maintain

American college students, have 
some sense of what is important 
to them and what is not. Some 
groups differ from the others; 
Harvard students are not UCSO 
students. So what? The schools 
are very different in their campus 
cultures. Cambridge is not like 
La Jolla. 

I think Gruen is right when he 
concludes that our school's stu-
dents wouldn't attend these 
events more if we had a football 
team. I think a large proportion 
of the student body doesn't find 
football interesting. Many even 
dislike it. Gruen would likely 
agree that only a minority of the 
students feel strongly enough to 
pay extra fees and attend the 
games if they were played. I 
think most of us do not object to 
having a football team, but 
many, including myself, don't 
find that not having one is really 
objectionable. 

I certainly object to having to 
pay more fees to start a team. I 
hope those students who enjoy 
football enough to play and 
watch it get som~ sponsors to 
pay for them to do so. But I think 
the student electorate has been 
consistent for years now, voting 
down support for a football 
tea m, confirming Gruen's sup-
posi tions and my claims. It i n't

An irresistable family saga and a rich social satire, The 
Holy Innocents is set in Franco's Spain of the 1960's. In a 
set of four flashbacks, a son's visits to his peasant parents 
on a remote mountain estate are used to dissect an anti-
quated feudal system that enabled the 'haves' to blindly 

patronize and oppress the 'have-nots.'

New technologies restore old art 

Counteracting the ravages of time 
By AUTUMN EHRMANN 
Staff Writer 

Back in the early seventies, 
UCSD physics professor John 
Asmus was working in a high-
tech industry for a company 
called 'Scien~ Applications' and 
was traveling to Europe several 
times a year . Then, he got in-
volved with a woman and things 
have never been the same. The 
woman is famous, recognized 
and admired by people all over 
the world , and she is worth 
millions. Her name is Mona Lisa 
and for Dr. Asmus, she became 
"a very serious hobby." 

layers of paint and varnish with-
out ever touching the actual 
painting. Asumus discovered 
that the "Mona Lisa" on display 
today at the Louvre has several 
differences from the original 
painting as it appeared in the 
early 1500s. 

"We found areas ofthe paint-
ing where there should be moun-
tains. One part of the mountain 
had been rubbed away by a past 
restorer. It appears to be trees 
now, but it was originally a part 
of a mountain. We also dis-
covered that the original ~Mona 
Lisa" was painted wearing a 
necklace. As he went on, he 
painted over the necklace, either 
to simplify the painting or to 
make it more religious. We aren't 
sure," Asmus said . 

Dr. Asmus had already had 
much experience using compu-
ters for the purpose of art restor-
ation when the late Sir Kenneth 
Clark asked him if he thought it 
would be possible to clean off the 
years and years of brown varnish 
that were slowly disfiguring Leo-
nardo da Vinci's masterpiece. 
After several years of unsuc-
cessful communication with the 
people at the Louvre, Clark and 
Asmus finally obtained a photo 
of the "Mona Lisa." Using his 
]BM Cores Data computer, 
Asmus "turned the clock back 
450 years and began reconstruct-
ing the " Mona Lisa." 

Mistakes such as inadvertently 
removing images on a painting 
while in the process of restoration 
are avoided with Asmus' tech-
nique of image processing. This 
process works only with com-
puter-generated images until 
every detail of the restoral can be 
meticulously planned. 

Ma,lo; R •• _a/ Guardian 
UCSD professor, John Asmus , uses computer imaging to reconstruct old works of art thai have been 
damaged over time. 

Through the image processing, 
Asmus was able to peel away 

"Image processing makes a 
prediction of what the final result 
will be like. The computer pre-
sents a cold simulation, it's true. 
I get much more excited when I 
see the real 'Mona Lisa, ... Asmus 
said. 

According to Asmus, the dif-
ficulties with ever actually restor-
ing the painting itself lie in the 
fact that the painting could be 
damaged and that it would be 
very difficult to remove the 
painting from the Louvre for any 
significant amount of time with-
out disappointing thousands of 
tourists. 

Asmus has many art restor-
ations to his credit. He has 
restored such masterpieces as 
Andrea Belsardi's "The Last 
Supper," The Donatella Statue 
in the Cathedral of Venice, and 
the Ducal Palace. ]n restoring 
one of Rembrandts's paintings, 
"Man With A Gorget," Asmus 
came across "something fuimy ." 
He took an X-Ray ofthe painting 
and, using image processing, 
'subtracted' the top picture then, 
inverted the entire painting, and 
discovered an entirely different 
picture. "When Rembrandt was 
broke," Asmus explained, "he 
would paint right over his other 
paintings because he couldn't 
afford to buy new canvasses." 

Through computer imaging, Dr. Asmus discovered thallhe original Asmus is currently utilizing 
Mona Lisa was painted wearing a necklace and thai Ihere were UCSO's Supercomputer to re-
mounlains painted in Ihe background. store Andrea Mantegna's fresco, 

"The Martyrdom of Christ," a 
project which Asmus refers to as 
"the world's greatest jigsaw 
puzzle." The fresco, which was 
destroyed by an Allied bomb in 
1944, now lies in approximately 
a half-million pieces in 34 large 
wooden crates. Fortunately, in 
January of 1944; just three 
months before the fresco was 
blown up, someone took the 
only color photo of it. Pro-
gramming this photo along with

mers in 1974. When the soldiers 
were first discovered, they still 
wore what is believed to be their 
original color, but, within a 
couple of weeks after their dis-
covery, oxidation began to fade 
them. Today, the soldiers look 
faded and dirty, but once again 
Dr. Asmus' talents will be put to 
use. He has taken photos of 
some of the soldiers and entered 
them into his computer. He is

information about shapes and 
color variations of each piece 
should enable the reconstruction 
of the fresco to slowly take place. 

Asmus is also working on 
restoring the color to more than 
6,000 Chinese terra-cotta soldiers 
dating back to 209 B.C. They

more than 200 colors to paint the 
soldiers the way he believes they

ation of the terra-cotta soldiers 
will involve the use of laser beams 
and inert gases.

Sun worshippers prepare 
for annual celebration 
By ARLEEN SAN MIGUEL 
Staff W,ite, 

T he Sun God is "a flaky piece of UCSD to build a tradition around," said 
John Steinhouse. chair of the 
Sun God Festival. 

Five years ago a few students 
got together to create a "big 
UCSD party" and to them the 
"Sun God seemed like a center-
piece for the campus," Stein-
house said. The yearly UCSD 
party has come to be known as 
the Sun God Festival and this 
year it promises to be bigger and 
better than before. 

The Sun God is "a 
flaky piece of UCSD 
to build a tradition 
around." 

-John Steinhouse 
Festival Chairperson 

In actuality, this year's Sun 
God festival is the sixth one that 
has been programmed at UCSD. 
the first one was rained out. The 
first two festivals were organized 
by Sue Lewis. who felt strongly 
about the project. She wanted to 
see it become a tradition. The 
project was later handed down 
to a group of students who also 
felt that it should become a tradi-
tion. 

With a "grass-roots effortfrom 
a few students," the festival 
became a traditional "big UCSD 
party" known as the Sun God 
Festival, Stein house said. 

As a result of the construction 
of the faculty building, this year's 
Sun God Festival will not be 
held near the Sun God. Because 
.Mile-High Field (north of 
UCSD's Super Computer off 
John Hopkins Road) is in the 
middle of nowhere, the number 
of noise complaints from the La 
Jolla community is expected to 
be minimal. Even the Super 
Computer's faculty gave students 
permission to disrupt their 24 
hour operation, so that the 

'PRICES INCLUDE: 
graphic cut, shampoo. 
conditioning and 
professional styling 

festival could be held on that 
field. If everything goes well, 
Mile-High Field may be the site 
for future Sun God Festivals. 

In effort to keep problem to a 
minimum, alcoholic beve rages 
will not be permitted in the 
festival , and security checks will 
be at the entrance. 

The UCSD Fifth Annual Sun 
God Festival is from 4 pm to 
II :30 pm on Friday, May 13. 
Food and game booths will be 
run by individual student organi-
zations who are budgeted by the 
Associated Students. Entertain-
ment beginning at 7:30 pm will 
include Preston Smith and the 
Crocodiles, comedienne Pauley 
Shore, and a special guest, The 
Mighty Lemon Drops. Profits 
from the fair go to the Abused 
Children's Foundation.

Women's tennis 
Continued from pale 16 
and all . 

To make it to the semi-finals, 
the Tritons beat Smith College 
5-2. The game was called after 
the Tritons assured themselves 
of the victory with their fifth 
match because the whole tour-
nament was running behind time. 

So the Tritons will have to 
wait until next year to regain the 
championship title. On a good 
note, most of the squad wi ll 

return. 
"We won't lose anyone to 

graduation. Susie [Mitchell] will 
lose her eligibility because she's 
played her fou~ years and Janet 
[Whalen] might be going to 
Japan, but other than that, 
everyone will be back," laPlante 
said . 

And if the game against 
Franklin and Marshall is any 
indication, they could be back 
with a vengeance. 

Men's 
Tennis 
Continued frOID pale 16 
right in there," Hammermeister 
said, Because of the similar level 
of play among the participating 
teams, "the winners will have to 
have a lot of things go right for 
them. " 

The Tritons will be bringing 
eight players to Lexington, three 
of which are returning veterans 
from last year's individual compe-
tition. In respective order of rank, 
thiS year's participants will be: 
Hunter Gallaway, Sig Huber, 
Francois Monnar, John Park, 
K.yle K.napp, Tim Ditzler, Jim 
Elliott, and Jeff French. The first 
six will play the singles matches. 
Gallaway and Huber will team 
up for the No. I doubles team, 
Monnar/ Elliotl the No . 2 team 
and French and Park will tak e 
the third spot. 

No. 5 seed Kyle Knapp repre-
sented the Tritons in the indi-
vidual singles competition at last 
year's Nationals. 

For the individual competi-
tions, Gallaway and Huber will 
represent the Tritons both in the 
singles competition and as a 
doubles team. Last year, UCSD 
qualified Monnar and Park as 
the doubles team and Knapp in 
singles, but the three did not do 
well enough this year to qualify 
for at-Iarle spots in the tourna-
ment. 

Surf team 
C __ e4I fro ..... 16 
Saturday's competition, UCSD 
moved up in the overall NSSA 
rankinp from fourth to third 
place. Should the system of 
choosinl teams for the national 
championships remains the same 
as in past years, UCSDis virtuaUy 
assured a spot amona the eight 
teams that will be invited. 

Nationall will be held in 
Huntington Beach IOmetimedur-
ina AUJUst. California schools 
have always dominated this event · 
which usually includes teams 
from Texas, Florida, and some-
times Hawaii. 

~use the checking of aca-
demiC records for Nationals 
usually disqualifies some of the 

~olden West teams, Glevy pre-
dicts the competition for this 
year's championships to be be-
tween UCSD and UCSB. 

The UCSD urfteam'sovera ll 
balance and strength in each 
div ision of co mpetition along 
with the expe ted return ofGlev

W. tennis takes third at Nationals 
Lose to Kenyon College, 5-4 in semifinals 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
S".,u Edit", 

yon's Grace Gardner, 7-5, 6-4 
and the Triton's no. 6 player 
Susan Carney took Cindy Smith 
three sets to win, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. 

No.2 Julie Berman of UCSD 
also went three sets against her 
opponent Clara Cambell, going 
a total of 32 games, but couldn't 

in two sets, 3-6, 6-7 (4-7 tie-
breaker). 

With the match tied after 
singles, it would be the doubles 
matches that would decide the 
fate of the Tritons. 

Behrens and Meier showed 
what put them into the national 

Schmeebeck a close match but 
couldn't pull out a win, 2-6, 6-7 
(7-9 tiebreaker). Usually, Whalen 
would have played instead of 
Berman but withdrew because of 
recurrinl trouble with her lei. 

So the match came down to 
the no. 3 doubles match between 

came out Wednesday morning 
for the competition for third 
place with a definite purpose. No 
match went longer than two sets 
as UCSD beat up Franklin and 
Marshall Collele, 8-1. 

Nostradamus' predictions 
didn't happen yesterday, but 
UCSD's women's tennis team 
suffer~d a tragedy of their own as 
they lost to Kenyon College, 5-4, 
in the semi-final round of the 
1988 NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championships, Tuesday, 
May 10. 

"It was a really close match all 
the way," was all a disappointed 
head coach Liz LaPlante could 
say in a telephone interview 
Wednesday. 

According to [head coach Liz] LaPlante, the team came out with 
vengeance in mind [after the loss to Kenyon] and Franklin and 
Marshall were the unfortunate ones to face their wrath. 

A quic:k run-down of the 
scores: Behren d. Amy Williams, 
6-3, 6-1; Berman d. Jennifer 
Galambos, 6-4, 6-2; Meier d. 
Shannon Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-S), 
Whalen d. Karin Hyman 6-4,6-
I; Elizabeth Kennedy d. Diels, 
6-3,6-2; Carney d. Atsuko Ueba, 
6-1,6-0. 

Disappointing, too, for the 
Tritons, who had been ranked 
no. I going into the tournament 
as defending champions. 

UCSD split the single matches 
with Kenyon, 3-3. No. I Triton 
seed Christine Behrens disposed 
of Julie Kipka 6-3, 6-2. No. 5 
Triton Kristen Diels beat Ken-

hold out for the win, 6-7 (4-7 in 
the tiebreaker), 7-5, 1-6. 

Triton team captain Rhonda 
Meier also ran into tough com-
petition against Kenyon's Lynne 
Schmeebeck, losing 4-6, 2-6. 

The Triton's no. 4 player, Janet 
Whalen, playing on a strained 
leg muscle, lost to Tia Tartaglioni 

Men's tennis 
ranked 6th for 
national tourney 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Spons Editor 

UC San Diego's men's tennis 
team made marked improvement 
over last year's season as they 
qualified for this year's NCAA 
National Tournament, ranked 
sixth in a field of ten. 

The tournament will be hosted 
by Washington and Lee Univer-
sity in Lexington, Virginia and 

State. Among the Banana Slug 
victories were UC Davis and 
CSU Hayward, both Division II 
schools. The Tritons faced Santa 
Cruz at Santa Cruz once this 
year, losing the April match, 5-4. 

"If we faced them again, we 
could beat them," Hammer-
meister said, assuredly. 

Behind UCSC in the rankings 
are hosts Washington and Lee,

Surf team finishes 
fourth at NSSA 
Championship 
By MIKE FOLEY 
st.n Writ. 

Despite some early setbacks in 
last weekend's NSSA Collegiate 
West Coast Championships at 
Bolsa Chica State Beach (just 
north of Huntington Beach), the 
UCSD surf team still finished a 
strong fourth behind Golden 
West, UCSB, and SDSU. 

Last Saturday's contest, ori-
ginally scheduled for two days, 
was held in very small surf which 
did affect the performances of 
some competitors who prefer 
biller waves. Three Triton surf-
ers were eliminated in their first 
heats, something that had never 
happened in earlier contests. How-
ever, UCSD was still able to 
finish among the leaders because 

of some outstanding performan-
ces by the other team members. 

Coach Mike Glevy, who was 
not able to compete because of 
reeent surgery, praised Steve Colt 
for helping pull the team along 
by picking up valuable points by 
winning most of his heats. Colt 
finished third overall in the men's 
division. The second-best perfor-
manee in the men's division was 
by team captain Allan Johnson 
who made it to the quarterfinals. 

The team also had great per-
formances in the other divisions 
with Jack Beresford finishing 
third in the knee board compe-
tition and Bob Crawford placing 
second in the bodyboard division. 
isabelle Tihanyi finished seventh 
in the women's division.

The house lights had gone 
out and the capacity crowd at 
San Diego State's Open Air 
Theatre was getting restless, 
awaiting the arrival of the 
reigning leaders of distortion 
pop, Love and Rockets. 
While most of the fortunate 
fans seated in the first section 
of the amphitheater pushed 
each other toward the stage, 
the remaining 4,OOO~plus au~ 
dience stood screaming and 
whistling in eager anticipation. 

In an instant, the crowd's 
noise·level went from a con~ 
strained roar to a near~riotous 
hysteria as a trite yet familiar 
tune btodcast over the sound~ 
system. It was the notorious 
Bubblemen 's theme song, ask~ 
ing the eternal question, "Do 
you believe in the Bubble· 
men?" that had evoked this 
anarchy. For most of the die· 
hard "Deathrock" rans, the 
corny melody meant that the 
Bubblemen (the alter egos of 
Love and Rockets) were about 
to be beamed onto the stage. 
As the three fairy·tale char~ 
acters dressed in black·and~ 
white bumblebee costumes 
danced, frolicked and rolled 

around onstage to the beat of 
the "Bubblemen Rap," the 
audience cheered and laughed 
uproariiously. But as quickly 
as they had appeared, the 
Bubblemen, pledging peace for 
the whole planet, were gone 
and the crowd was satisfied in 
knowing that they had just 
witnessed something that few 
others had seen before. 

The house lights were again 
restored, and order was once 
again retained. It would be 
nearly half~an·hour before the 
English trio would take the 
stage again, returning the out~ 
door venue to its unruly state. 

Soon, Love and Rockets, 
which includes three former 
members of England's pre~ 
miere doom~and~gloom band, 
Bauhaus, anonymously walked 
to their respective positions 
amidst a deafening hum. 

Opening with a collection 
of early and new unreleased 
material, it was evident that 
although the band consists of 
only three members, they're 
capable of producing enor~ 
mously loud music. As sin~ 
ger/axeman Daniel Ash twis· 
ted around the stage powering 

by larry weintraub 
hiafua writer 

thunderous riffs from his 
aluminum foil~wrapped guitar, 
David J. stood motionless eye· 
ing his abused fretless bass 
through darkened spectacles, 
and Kevin Haskins pummeled 
away on his drums. 

It wasn't until several son~s 
into their set that Love and 
Rockets were able to fully 
captivate their audience, when 
David J. teasingly plucked the 
bass~line to the immortal 
Bauhaus classic, "Bela Lugo. 
si's Dead." Not, however, 
completing the song, Daniel 
picked up the pace and flowed 
into the powerful, "Yin and 
Yang the Flower Pot Man" 
from their second album, 
"Express ... 

Daniel added the saxophone 
to his repertoire, bringing 
haunting charisma to the 
moody "It Could Be Sun· 
shine." as DavidJ. sang, "You 
can get from here to there/By 
leaps and bounds or mea.sured 
steps/Yau an make ask dark 
affair / Depending on your point 
of view." 

One of the show's high. 
lights came when Daniel 
picked up his 12·string acous· 

tic guitar and began strum· 
ming the chords to the force· 
ful "No New Tale To Tell," 
the first single off their cur· 
rent "Earth, Sun, Moon" 
album. Equally exhilarating 
was the transition to the band's 
current hit. "Mirror People." 

After about 70 minutes of 
ear.shattering music, hypno. 
tizing strobes and laser·like light 
beams, the band casually left 
the stage. Returning shortly 
after, the band began its encore 
with their first domestic hit 
song, "Kundalina Express." 
Ending the show, the Bub· 
blemen reappeared for the 
final number, the funky 
"Lazy." As both Daniel and 
David walked offstage still 
playing their respective 
instruments, Kevin continued 
to retain the beat, bringing the 
show to an end. 

In retrospect, Love and 
Rockets put on a tremen· 
dously powerful show, high. 
lighting material from all three 
of their albums, as well as new 
yet·to.be released material. 
While not noted for action· 
packed shows, Love and 
Rockets sounded and per· 

formed exceptionally well. 
Opening the show was 

another of Europe's bri~htest 
bands, The Mighty Lemon 
Drops. Dressed in leather 
jackets and blue~jeans, the 
clean·cut rockers churned out 
an impressive set. Having been 
heavily compared to England's 
Echo and the Bunnymen, The 
Mighty Lemon Drops pro· 
duce a similar type of early 
rock·influenced music. 

Having gained substantial 
success with European audi· 
ences, the band is currently 
touring the United States in 
support of their latest album, 
"World Without Ends," 
which contains the catchy hit 
"Inside Out." Playing exten· 
sively in Southern California, 
the band's stops include a 
headlining spot at the North 
Park Theatre, and top billing 
at UCSD's annual Sun God 
Festival. 

Based on their performance 
with Love and Rockets on 
Saturday ni~ht, UCSD can 
expect The Mighty Lemon 
Drops to put on a great show 
featuring solid rock 'n' roll 
with a powerful edge.

Long Viva Morrissey 
by larry weintraub 

hiarw writer 

Following the demise of one 
of music's most innovative 
and thought provoking bands, 
The Smiths, lead singer and 
lyricist Morrissey has re~ 
bounded with a dark and 
intense debut solo album 
entitled, "Viva Hate," As the 
album's tide implies, "Viva 
Hate" is not filled with very 
optimistic lyrics, however, 
both the simple and complex 
orchestration that surrounds 
each song beautifully com~ 
plements Morrissey's slightly 
demented prophecies. 

In an interview that ap~ 
peared in an English magazine, 
Morrissey claims that he was 
the last one to find out that 
The Smiths had broken up. 
Stating that he found out that 
guitarist Johnny Marr had left 
to work with the Talking 
Heads and the Pretenders by 
reading it in a music tabloid, 
Morrissey states that he hasn't 
spoken with ~arr or the rest 

of the band since the comple~ 
tion of their last album, 
"Srrangeways, Here We 
Come ." With remaining 
Smiths members Andy Rourke 
and Mike joyce currently 
touring with rising Irish star 
Sinead O'Connor, Morrissey 
enlisted the aid of producer / 
musician Stephen Street to 
begin work on "Viva Hate." 

Not wanting to sort through 
the legal mess that would ensue 
if Morrissey were to retain 
The Smiths moniker, the soft~ 
spoken Englishman opted to 
promote his own name. Al~ 
though the album is filled with 
depressing and gloomy satiri~ 
zation, Morrissey insists that 
he has no hard feelings 
towards his former band~ 
mates, just a disappointment 
that they hadn't gone further. 

"Viva Hate" opens with two 
somber songs, "Alastian Cou-
sin" and "Little Man, What 
Now?," which speak of broken 
love and broken dreams re~ 
spectively. It is the third and 

most powerful song. "Every~ 
day is Like Sundav" that 
should be considucd one o-f 

_the-besttunei Morriuey has 
ever been involved with. A 
forceful and movins melody 
about life after nuclear des-
truction, Morrissey moans, 
"Hide on the promenade/Scratch 
out a postcard/HOUI I dearly 
wish 1 was not here/In the sea· 
side town/. .. that they forgot to 
bomb/Come! Come! Come -
nuclear bombJ" 

Following are several 
dreamy and haunting songs 
similar to some of the earlier 
Smiths material. It is not until 
the catchy "Suede head' that 
the album really picks up 
tempo. The current single is a 
musical treat that sends a 
reminder of some of The 
Smiths' more proKr.sive 

material from their later 
albums. 

One of the most enjoyable 
songs is the witty, "Hairdresser 
on Fire." Unfortunately for 
record buyers, the song only 

appears on the cassette and 
compact disc version, which 
leaves many without the op~ 
portunity to hear Morrissey 
whine about his inability to 
get a haircut appointment. 

Reminiscing back to The 
Smiths' album, "The QJeen 
Is Dead," Morrissey ends 
"Viva Hate" with a political 
statement calling for the death 
of English Prime Minister 
Marsaret Thatcher, in "Mar-
garet On the Guillotine." 
Morr.iaaey tends out a very 
bleak message as he recites, 
"The kind people have a wond· 
erful dream/Margaret on the 
guillotine / Becawe like ,au make 
be {eel so tired/When will you 
die?" 

Though the gloom hangs 
high, if you are a Smiths fan, 
you'll no doubt see some 
prosperity in Morrissey's 
"Viva Hate." Most people who 
have followed the band since 
its inception have come to 
expect the pessimism and 
alternative outlook from 
Morrissey's lyricS, and "Viva 
Hate" is no exception. From a 
fan's standpoint, Morrissey 
has delivered the next best 
thing to a new Smiths album, 
which is mdre than most ever 
expected. 

Poetic Carroll performs 
by adam levy 

hiarul writer 

Jim Carroll grew up in the 
streets of New York during 
the turbulent '60s. It was there 
that he learned to despise the 
hypocrisy and lies that sur~ 
rounded him. 

Carroll uses these experien~ 
ces in his prose and poetry, 
and has become a well-known 
songwriter and poet. He will 
be appearing at the Spirit Club 
Sunday at 8 p.m. to perform 
his works. 

Carroll began writing at age 
13 with his first book entitled 
The BasketbaLL Diaries. In it, he 
revealed the daily struggles of 
his teenage years, and his bouts 
with heroin addiction. More 
importantly, however, the 
diaries were insightful and 
honest revelations of the insane 
world in which he found him-
self - the ftigid, asphalt streets 
of the metropolis. This theme 
would be found often in his 
later works. 

The book was considered 
ground~breaking for its style 
and punkish elements. It was 
published in the Paris Re\liew 
and inspired jack Kerouac to 
write, "At 13 years of age, jim 
Carroll writes better prose 
than 89 percent of the nove~ 
lists working today." 

In '74 Carroll moved to San 
Francisco where he published 
his first collection of Poetry 
called Living At The Movies. 

1 im Carroll will be performing at the 
Spirit on Sunday. 

Movies." It was enthusiastically 
received, and at age 22, he 
became the youngest to be 
nominated for a Puliner Prize. 
He has recently published two 
other works of prose and 
poetry: The Book of Nods, and 
Forced EntTies: The Downtown 
Diaries. 

By the late '70s, Carroll had 
formed a band and later re~ 
leased three albums, two of 
which are entitled "Catholic 
Boy" and "Dry Dreams." 

His songs, like much of his 
prose, view the world from an 
alienated perspective, often 
dealing with the. New York 
city subculture that he knew 
so well. Professor Larry 
McCaffery, who teaches New 

American Fiction at UCSD, 
and who relZards Carroll as an 
extremely influential personr 
in Post-modernist expression, 
said that although his music is 
alienated, Carroll's honesty 
shines through and makes the 
listener contend with realities 
that are "outside of regular 
societal norms." He further 
described Carroll's music as 
"surrealist, hard~edged with 
hallUcinatory vividness." 

Carroll has also collaborated 
with Patti Smith and Lou Reed, 
and was an important figure in 
the art rock scene that took 
place in New York in the 

mid~'70s. 
Most recently, he is work~ 

ing on an album in collabora~ 
tion with Ray Maruurek, organ 
player for the Doors and pro~ 
ducer of X's albums. Man~ 
zurek has compared Carroll to 
Jim Morrison for his similar 
verbal gifts.

Photos. A white room lined with photos. 84 photos inside plastic baggies with 
ziplock tops . All at eye level. The line of prints goes around the studio space at the 
Annex Gallery. They are neatly pinned to the wall with tacks. Instamatic. They are 
all Polaroid instamatic prints. You can tell by the white frames that are a part of 
each photo. "Keep it simple," says Roberto Salas. "No fingerprints, no frame . It's 
easy, casual, quick, humorous~practicality intent." 

Little vignette . Out of ontext. Objects are enclosed in the baggies. Above a 
gray ink spreckled with paint. A print. Roberto Salas himself is contained in the 
bag. So is blue water . The show is playful. TIlere is a photo of the title of the 
installation in one of the baggies. "Class~ Conecious Conefessions~ Final Cone~ 
tact." He even plays with words. Cones. Bright orange pylons. Traffic cones. He 
has been working 11 years with cones. "They are objects used over and over again . 
They have pyramid similarities, they are like volcanoes, full of power, the temple 
of the earth. They are experiments - I'm obsessed with how to use them; my new 
discoveries are very playful."

He told me about his plans for an eighteen~foot blue concrete palm tree for 

Harbor Island that is still awaiting approval from the San Diego Port Commission. 
As we talk , the dark~haired artist walked to the next studio, got out his Polaroid 
instamatic camera and waved for me to come along. Sitting on the desk, amongst 
art supplies, was an avocado sandwich from the Che Cafe. Salas took a picture of 
it and slipped the undeveloped print of the sandwich and the real sandwich into a 
plastic zip~lock baggie. 

The show runs until Mar 13.

Quick 
fall 

bV robert leone 
hiatul writer 

W.T. QUick's 1988 sci~ 
ence~fiction novel Dreams of 
Flesh and Sand has problems. 
To begin with, his use of char~ 
acterization is weak; when he 
wants to show that a character 
is tough, ~ick uncreatively 
laces that character's language 
with profanity. QUick's de~ 
scriptions are quirky and dis~ 
joined, and he overuses the 
technique by which objects 
are described by their brand 
names, instead of by their 
physical attributes. The narra~ 
tive is third person singular, 
although Quick changes char~ 
acters at the drop of a micro~ 
chip, which makes the plot 
hard to follow. 

And then there's the plot, 
which concerns the corporate 
conflict between a gigantic 

multi~national corporation 
and its computer system, with 
interference by such peripheral 
parties as other corporations 
(including The Moon, Inc.). 
It's a relief when Quick stops 
complicating the plot and 
writes in some senseless vio~ 
lence. Three people apparently 
die on page one, all in nasty 
ways, including a fall from the 
237th floor of an office build~ 

i ing. The pace slows down a 
little after that, but not much. 
Blood and guts appear to be 

~ick's forte. 
Reviewers should regard the 

fictional reality of a science~ 
fiction novel as a part of the 
author'S creation, worthy and 

I deserving of comment. With QUick's work, you can see 
~ where the serial numbers have 

been filed off his version of 
future reality. Quick has lifted 
out vast chunks of William 
Gibson's 1984 Hugo and 
Nebula award~winning novel 
Neuromancer to "create" a 
frame of reference. It's fairly 
obvious that Quick is trying 
to cash in on Gibson's suc~ 
cess, and his attempt is hopt'~ 
lessly botched.
