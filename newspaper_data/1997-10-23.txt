Mold Turns Library Into Study Area 
ASPERGILLUS: Hot 
and humid conditions 
caused growth 
By Annam Manthlram 
Guardian Reporter 

The Undergraduate Library is 
no longer proVIding students with 
books; however, there is plenty of 
sludy space. 

In early September, library staff 
began to notice an outbreak of the 
Aspergillus mold on the 
Undergraduale Library 's book col-
lection. 

Although the staff instituted 
cleaning procedures, the mold 

could not be contained. 
Aspergillus is prevalenl in lhe 

library because of recent hot and 
humid weather conditions. In addi -
tion to the mold, there was an 
infestation of book li ce. Mold acb 
as an initIal host for hook li ce. 

The 35-year-old library has 
never had m ventilation or CI rcula-
tion sy tems upgraded. As a result, 
the staff could not effectively reg-
ulate the temperature mside the 
library. 

Librarian Kari Lucas said it's 
difficult for her to not be able lo 
provide students with books. 

"We're a library and we can ' t 
let people borrow books," she said. 

"Many sludents have GREs and 
placement tests to study for and 
they can' l check out the books 
they need." 

Lucas said books will be avail-
ah le in mid-December for use in 
the first -fl oor we~t wing of the 
Geisel Library. 

According to Lucas, the mold 
and lice wi ll probably only affect 

~tudents with severe allergies so 
they might want to stay away from 
the library. 

Lucas said thal the cleaning 
process will lake about eight 
weeks. According to the library 
preservation depanment and the

Agenda 
ACTION: A.S. 
discusses points of 
UCSA's '97-'98 plan 
By Julia Kull~ad., 
Co-News Editor 

A.S. Pre ident Sou Icy Diallo 
told the Associated Students' 
Counci I last night thal he had 
vetoed the University of California 
Student Association (UCSA) 
advocacy agenda. 

The annual agenda, which is 
the hack bone of UCSA's educa-
tional campaigns for 1997-1998, 
consisls of six main poinls: lhe 
affordability of attending the UC 
syslem; admissions and educalion-
al outreach; instructional technolo-
gy; campus crime, safety, and 
police accountability; graduate 
student unions; and aid to immI-
grant students. 

Lasl week, the A.S . Counci l 
spent more than an hour debating 
the last lWO issues - graduate stu-
denl unions and sludent immi-
grants. 

Diallo said lhal although the 
measure passed 15 lO five with 
three abstenlions, he fell the vote 
was not representalive of the will 
of the council. Specifically, Diallo 
said he thinks the results of the 
vole would have been different If 
the counCI l had voted on each 
agenda Ilem indIVidually and not 
just on the agenda as a whole. 

"I got the sentiment from a lot 
of council members that it defi -
nilely would have been a lot more 
of a controversial issue if they did-
n't have to approve the item as a 
whole," Diallo said.

Freedom of the Pre .. 
Violated in Public Meeting 

The U.S. -Mexico Border Policy workshop held by 
the Center for U.s.-Mexican Studies and the Center 
for Iberian and Latin American Studies last Friday 
violated the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

Although the workshop it~elf was free and open to 
the general public, it was requested that some of the 
comments made be "off the record," thereby usurp-
ing the freedom of the press . 

As journali~ts, we at the GLiurdiull have the right and 
responsibility to record such an important public event. 
Although our code of professional ethics mandates that 
we re~pec t the privacy requests of our ~ources, we must 
indignantly protest the denial to repolt the proceedings 
of an allegedly "public" worhhop. 

U.S. Attorney Alan Bersin and Robert Bach of the 
INS - two federal omcials who participated in the 
workshop - should have objected in favor of the press. 
After all, a~ government authorities, they are obligated to 
uphold the Constitution. 

If one desires hi s or her comment to be "off the 
record," then one should not speak at a workshop 
open to the public . 

Nonresidents Lose, Faculty 
Gain in 1998-99 Budget 

UC President Dick Atkinson 's proposed 1998-99 
UC budget renects the $190 fee cut crammed down 
his throat by Gov. Pete Wilson and the state 
Legislature. It also raises nonre~ident students' 
already obscene tuition by $400. While we an; philo-
sophically opposed to fee increases , at leustthis time 
the extra money wi II go to a good cau~e - the UC 
system's $500 mi II ion maintenance backlog. 

The uni ver\ ity\ dekrred maintenance needs to be 
addressed, but it is not right to sock non resident stu-
dents with the bill. Atkinson could have taken the $6 
million the tuition increasl! is expected to raise rrom 
somewhere else, like the $70.8 milli on allocated to 
pay increases for faculty and stall. 

ure, the univers ity's tireless employees deserve 
raises - but money is not everything when it comes 
to attracting top-notch people. 

Next month, the regents will decide the fate of 
domestic-partnership benefits in the UC system. As 
UC Regent Ward Connerly said, "It really boils down 
to treating everyone the way you want to be treated. 
This should not be a hard decision for us." 

He's right - it shouldn't.

THREE YEARS LATER, PROP. 
184 IMPROVED NOTHING 

COMMENTARY: The emotionally-driven 1994 "Three Strikes Law" may 
actually have increased the rate of crime that it was intended to stop 
By Simone Santini 
Contflbutmg OpinIon Wnter 

Threl.! years ago, Cali rornm VOler, 
pa~scd Prorxlsltion 184 by an over-
wheirnll1g majority. PropOSItion 184 is 
the famou~ "Tllr.:e Slrlkes" law by 
which a criminal's Ihird felony convic -
tion carnt.:s a mandatory prison ~en ­
tcnce 01'25 years 10 life . 

The elecloral yl.!<lr of 1994 was 
marked by Proposi ti on 184 as Ihe 
cmolional legislation of the election . 
Many con~ervative candidate\ enlhu-
sHIslically cndor~ed the propo~ltl()n . 
tryi ng to prove I hcy were "Iough on 
cnme." Tim proposition has lurned 
out to he appealing on .I n emoti ona l 
level only; it IS not an effect lvc way Lo 
redu ce Ihe number 01 vlOlenl crimi -
nab. 

Now thilt thl.! proposition IS practi-
cally cast in stone in California law, it 
is timc for a stricter assessment of ils 
cffects. In spite of the claims stated in 
the 1994 campaign, Proposition 184 
was not cn;aled to punish Ihe most vio-
lenl offenders. If you arc a threl.!-time 
murderer or rapist , no court need~ Ihe 
three-slrikes law to sentence you to a 
long prison term. 

In the rhetoric excitation of "being 
tough on crime," voters seem to have 
forgotlen. Ihis fael. 

Proposition 184 docs make a differ-
enct.: for those convicled of non-vio-
knt fdonies . In California, you could 
theorelica lly be senlel1\;ed to serve 25 
years to life for stealing thn:e slices of 
pI/fa II you have a history of minor 
l'cIonie~ . Allhough morally reprehensi -
ble, tim resembles an actual ca,e thaI 
crossed Ihe California judiCial docket. 

Proponenls of 184 suggested that it 
would be a formidable delerrent for 
Violent cn minals. Forlunately, il is 
quite easy to compare the resulls of the 
proposed deterren~e. since California 

Imposing the same 
hard sanctions on 
non-violent and 
violent crimes Is 
tantamount to inviting 
criminals to be violent 
- they have nothing 
to lose. 
is the only Siale in the union (and the 
only legislative body in the world) to 
actively pursue such a law. 

Statistics show that the crime rate 
has indeed decreased in the last three 
years but no more in Califomia than in 
other Slates. There is no reason to 
believc that the three-strikes law 
proves as a special dl!terrent not 
already present in other laws. 

Analysis seem 10 agree that the 
causes of Ihe reduced cri me rate in the 
U.S. are es,entially dcmographic -
baby boomers are moving past the age 
group most likely 10 comlllit violent 
cri Illes. 

It is ironic thaI when voters passed 
Proposition 184, Violent crllne had 
already been declining acros, the U.S. 
for two years. Statistics do show a 
peak in 1992. but it preceded a slow, 

yet con ~la nl. decline . 
Some ana lysts predicted an 

unwanted side efrect of 184 - il 
cou ld actually instigate violent crimes. 
Th~ rallon ;d~ behind thi . i, that ir a 
criminal" colllmilling a third felon y, 
cven a non-violent onc (such as smok-
Ing pot ). he 1\ more lik.:ly to rcact VIO-
lently dunng JrrC,1 huch as assault or 
pOSSible even murder) 10 escape ralh~r 
than face 25 ,cars III prISon. 

Onl.! IlllSle<lding assumption 01 184 
IS Ihal a crimlilal will rationally a~,e;s 
the fJro~ and cons or commilling a 
crime when fating possi ble arrest. 
This is almo,t ne ver the case. 

Consider, for example, the punish-
mcnt for drive-by shooting - a mild 
Ii ve years in jai I. I I' you make a cold, 
dispassionate and rational assessment 
or the situation, you will conclude that 
il is not worth spending five years in 
jail for the thrill of driving around in a 
car, shooting aL random. However, 
people who commit Ihese aCls, though, 
do not act rationally and do not expect 
to be caughl. 

Blindingly drastic measures like 
the three-strikes laws can only 
increase the level of desperation in 
ordinarily non-violent criminals. Their 
urge noL to get caught, and their readi-
ness to resort to violence will 
supercede any rational thought of 
which they mighl be capable. To the 
be t of my knowledge, there is no data 
to determine whether violence induced 
by Proposition 184 is a statislically 
significant phenomenon, but Ihe very 
fact that it is even possible ought to 
make us reconsider our vote. 

Like too many other writs of legis-
lation, Proposition 184 was wrillen. 
endorsed and approved on a purely 
emotional campaign. Citizens arc 
scared by crime and feel that "somc-

"II I> evident that wi th the

feeling Ihe direct effects of 
Proposition 209." she continued. 
"The admls~ions of ~tudc nt s of

not only at the undergraduate level 
but also at the graduate level." 

Speaking for the Movimiento

Gabriella Juarez, a Roosevelt

about the lack of Latino students on 
campus. 

Accordi ng 10 Juaret, even 
though Latinos make up 25 percent 
of California's population. UCSD 
has only 315 Chicano unuergradu-
ates and three Chicano medical stu-

example of what people of color 
can achieve when given the oppor-
tunity to do so.

Despite A Few Scares, It's No 'Scream' 
Poor acting and slow plot cause '[ Kno.w What You Did Last Summer' to fall short 

By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Wriler 

Let 's be honcst. The lone pur-
puse of a horror flick is to sca re the 
li ving daylights out or the audi -
enl:e. lIS success rate should bc pro-
portionallo the screams, gasps and 
terrified looks lhat it evokes . With 

thi~ criteria in mind. Jim Gillespe's 
"I Know What You Did Last 
Summer" adequately serves the 
purpose of putting fear into the 
heart of the moviegoer. As long as 
the poor acting, slow-moving plot 
and predictahle scrip t don 't bother 
you, however, u's worth the 4.50. 

Written by Ke vin Williams (or 
"Scream" fame), the setting for " I 
Know What You Did Last 
Summer" is Southport, N.C. - an 
idyllic seaSide fishing vi llage. 11\ 
the perfect town wi lh the peri'cct

Where did the neme "Buck-O-

Way back when, there was this 
Eddic Murphy movie called "Raw," 
and one of the punchlines for a joke 
he says is "Your mama don't weigh 
more than a buck -0- fi ve." So some-
one was teasing our bass player 
about it, and instead of saying the 
joke correcdy he said it "buck-o-
nine," and somehow the name stuck. 
You *'IYI played on the w.ped

It was incredible. It was great, 
because we're playing with bands, 
you know. Back when I was in high

came around. To be able to go on 
tour wilh bands like that and The 
Mighty Mighty Bosstones and 
Blink-182, that was prelly cool. 
Vou're '01", out with PrImus 
next? 

Actually we just finished our 
last show with Primus. We were out 
with them for about three·and-a-
half weeks. 
How wet that tour? 

It was prelly cool. " was differ-
ent, because Primus crowds don't 
come prepared to see ska bands, I 
don't think. So the people who did-
n't know who we were, sometimes 
it went over good and sometimes it 
didn't, but there were still people 
there who came out to see us. There 
were still a lot of people who got 
stoked out on us every nighl. 

Whet w. It like pleyl", In front

Street Scene '971 

I was really happy. I mean, it 
was a great way to come home, 
because at that point we had been 
playing a lot of shows out of town 
and we'd been on tour all summer, 
and we hadn't really played any San 
Diego shows, so that was greal. 
How did you end up on TVT? 

It got to the point where we 
needed a label that was bigger, or 
more capable of supporting the 
band in the capacity we needed. So 
we just started gelling in touch with 
a ton of labels, and our manager set 
up a bunch of stuff, and it turned 
out that TVT was jusl Ihc best one.

Well as far as lhe songwriling, 
it's a growth. The songs we wrote 
for the record, we reached a point 
where our songwriling ability as a 
band is beller than ever before. As 
for lhe recording, Ihe actual sound 
quality, we just wanted to make the 
best sounding album possible, so 
we didn't shool for something that 
some people call "overproduced." 
Some people do say Ihat it sounds 
that way, but to us, we just tried to 
make the best record we could. 

Over the years we have gOlten a 
lot tighter, so the performances are 
prelly clean. We're really happy 
with the way it sounds, and we did-
n't write songs like "Tear Jerky" or 
"Peach Fish" on the older albums.

Wow, I didn't even know about 
that. We've been gone for so long; 
since March I've been home for 
maybe a total of a month-and-a-
half or two months, so I don't even 
know what's going on. I'm hon-
ored. J guess I'm aware that the San 
Diego Music Awards show is 
around this time of year, but I 
haven't really thought about it 
because vve've been so consunned 
with other things. 

Whatever we're nominated for, 
I'm honored. I'm glad that we still 
rub off on people that way. I'm just 
really stoked that people are sti II 
really supportive of the band. 
Are you surprised by the succe .. 
of MMy Town,· since It·s on MTV 
and the radio now? 

Yes and no. I'd say yes, mostly 
because when we were doing the 
record, we weren't thinking of 
releasing a single for awhile, we 
were thinking of jusl touring 
behind the record for about four or 
fi ve months. 

The record was released on 
April 15, and we were thinking of 
touring through September and 
then releasing a single, but all of a 
sudden radio stations started pick-
ing up on il. Once the momentum 
got going, I was really surprised 
because it gOl into the Billboard 
Top 40, and I was just tripping out. 
At the same time, we happen to be 
at a point in music where ska is 
being accepted, so from that stand-
point it made sense. Of course, we 
were kind of surprised and we were 
pretty stoked on it.

[ don't know, it's hard to say. 
There's always been so many ska 
bands and there always will be, so 
no matter what happens, ska music 
is always going to be huge because 
of the underground. 

As far as commercial, it's really 
hard to speculate, because I don't 
really underSland how comnnercial 
radio works. I understand how a 
label or a band gets their song on 
the radio, it's all about who you 
know and what program directors 
and certain key stations think, and 
this and thaI. As far as what they're 
thinking, I don't know. I heard 
rumors that KROQ doesn't want 
any more ska bands because 
they've heard all the ones they 
want to hear, but who knows? 
Ale the sones that you write 
autoblopaphlcal Incidents or ere 
they tlctlonel? 

Both, really. Like "Jennifer's 
Cold," that's nOl really about a girl 
named Jennifer. So that's kind of a 
fictional character that represents 
women or girls that complain about 
everything, or when they have a lit-
tle problem they blow it out of pro-
portion. 

But "Nineteen," that's a song 
that Jon wrote the lyrics to, and it 's 
kind of autobiographical in the 
sense that he was talking about 
how, when he wrote the song, it 
was based on a lot of thoughts that 
were in his mind when we were 
switching to a new label and writ-
ing a new record. 

"Albuquerque," which is a song 
that I wrOle the lyrics for, is autobi-
ographical in the sense that I was 
thinking about a lot of friends I had 
in the past and when I wrote the 
song, J was thinking about a state 
of mind that I sometimes get into, 

Thursday, October 23, 1997 

or that everyone gets into. It comes 
from everything. 

Jon used to work in a record 
store, so when the song "Record 
Store" came about, it was preny 
autobiographical. 

"Linle Pain Inside" is kind of 
our attempt at a joke, but at the 
same time it 's true because we're 
on the road so much and we eat so 
much crappy food , like Taco Bell 
and everything. 
What's the belt thing about 
being In Buck-O-Nlne? 

We just get to travel the country 
consistently, and also the world. A 
week from today, we'll be in Japan. 
The best part is definitely being 
able to travel on the road and play 
shows for people and see that your 
music is appreciated all over. 

One thing I always thought is 
once we started touring three years 
ago, ] always kind of thought that 
certain people in the San Diego 
music scene had an attitude that 
San Diego was the center of its 
own linle world. 

Once you travel outside of San 
Diego you realize that there's so 
much going on all over the world 
and all over the country, and you go 
to different music scenes in differ-
ent cities and kids are coming out 
to see you and going balls-oul and 
they love your music, that's the 
most incredible feeling. Like 
you're silting there playing in 
Providence, R.I.. and some kid in 
the front row is singing the words 
to all the songs, it's the greatest 
thrill. 
Are you excited to corne beck 
end pley In San DleJo? 

Oh, absolutely. It's our favorite 
place to play, and I'm really look-
ing forward to it.

Passing in the Night 
'Tall Ships ': A reflection of our minds 

By Walt DIckinson 
Senior Staff Writer 

In the course or an average day 
on the UCSD campus, everyone 
has the opportunity to noti ce hun-
dreds of fellow student s. 

We notice dirferences in each 
other. Some wear suits, some wear 
sandals. Some are old, some are 
young. Some look certain, some 
aren ' t quite sure . 

What we see and what we think 
about what we see varies greatly 
from person to person. How we 
perceive each other creates win-
dows through which we can see 
ourselves. 

This self-renection is the sub-
ject of artist Gary Hill's "Tall 
Ships." 

The installation is a completely 
dark , 6O-foot long corridor with 
one doorway through which visi -
lor may enler and exit at their 
leisure. 

Sensors in the noor activate 

video projections on the walls of 
the corridor. Depending on one\ 
position in the room, certain 
images will appear to move closer 
or further away. 

The i mages are of people. These 
people vary in age, gender and eth-
nic orig in. As they move towards 
the viewer, Iheir expressions 
change, their body language speah 
and they communicate wilh the 
viewer. 

The initial immersion of the 
viewer in darkness produces a 
sense or serenity. The si lence of the 
exhibit encourages the viewer to 
think introspectively. 

As the images or the people 
seem to be perceiving the viewer, 
the viewer becomes aware or their 
own perceptions or others. 

"Tall Ships" is on display in the 
University Art Gallery Tuesday 
through Saturday from II a.m. to 4 
p.m. in Mandeville Center through 
Dec. 13 .

LAUGHS: 
New policy allows 
underage patrons 
Continued frOM paC. 14 
they hadn 'l have been on thai 
stuff." 

Unlike most comedy club own-
ers, Shore has never thought about 
perronning on-stage. The last lime 
she performed was when she was 
three and a half years old in a 
Purim play. 

"I was so embarrassed because 
I forgot my lines," she said . I never 
went on the stage after that. Thai 's 
part of my personality because I 
sl ill won 't get on the stage. But 
that 's OK because nobody needs 
me on the stage. I think they enjoy 
me not being on stage. In the olher 
clubs the owners do get on the 
stage but that isn'l my thing. It's 
my joy to help them." 

Shore was never any onc 's 
agent or manager but she did pro-
vide the place for Pauly to get 
started. He was 16 when he made 
hi s debut on stage. 

"When he was growing up he 
was always independent ," she 
said . I was working and he always 
did what he wanled to do. I never 
stopped him rrom anything. When 
he went to camp he hated it. I had 
to go back there and pick him up 
and bring him back . 

"He was nol a good student. He 
was good in dance and art. But the 
rest of the suhjects he flunked. He 
is what he is. He does whal he 
wants to do . He makes mistakes. 
He appeals to the kids . He appeals 
to adults, too, but his mainstay is 
the kids . Now he's going through a 
transitional period but he is still 

hanging on 10 the weasel , the 
loner, the gU) who is alway~ 
pou nded on." 

Being a cluh owner and watch-
ing a co medi an perform is one 
thing. Being a mother and watch-
ing her son perform is anot her. 
"From a mother's point of view 
watching her son," she said, .. the 
only thing I object 10 is when he 
works dirty. Other than that his 
comedy is very runny. I enjoy 
walching him when he keeps it 
clean." 

Having been in the comic busi -
ne~s ror over 30 years Mit71 Shore 
sees the markel'S demise toward 
greediness which started in the 
early ·80s. 

" I would hope that it will sim-
mer down. II 's not much fun in Ihe 
busines to have that kind of 
greediness going on rather than 
seeing where the talent i, ." 

Shore allributes what she terms 
as "hcing grabby" to the different 
values I.:ulti vated by a generalion 
of baby boomers. "The prior gen-
eration of people thai ran the com-
edy business had more of a back-
ground on whal comedy was 
about. But the baby boomers are 
all graduates from college and 
they don 'l know from night clubs . 
They were born in a dirferenltime . 
Money is essential for their being, 
whereas the general ion from 
before were into it Icomedyl ror 
the love of the art . I don't see that 
anymore." 

The Comedy Store, which con-
tinues 10 focus on comedy as an art 
form that must be culti vated and a 
skill that must be honed, is proor 
that not all dubs conform to a 
standard dictated by economics. 

"To see the best in comedy you 

The UCSD GuarOlail 

have to wait a bi t and let the come-
dlan~ develop it." For Shore. 
paving the road for the hundreds 
of comedians who have walked 
away as stars is the reward. 

"We do develop the bc~t stand-
ups," said Shore as she recounted 
a story ahout Midlacl Ri chards 
(Kramer of "Seinfeld· '). "I sent 
him some flowers that sa id, 
'Thanks for givi,ng laughter to the 
whole country. It 's wonderrul. ' 
You can see how inspirational it is 
for a series of thai nalure to have a 
wmic like Michael Richards ." 

Gary Shandling wllrk~d for 
seven years before Shore made 
him a paid regular. " I alway_ said, 
'You ' re a writer, you ' re a writer. I 
just have a sixth sense ahoul 
that. .. ' When I sec a raw talent in a 
person who's got what the people 
want to see and then I develop 
them by booking them in the 
shows . I was there to pick them 
up from the lineups, pick them out. 
I was there al the beginning stages 
of their career. It was like molding 
somebody. It was a great deal of 
fun . I'm rea ll y proud of the 
amount of wmics form the slOre 
that arc so popular in the husiness. 

"Ir an extraordinari ly funny 
person doesn't have the talent to 
be a performer," said Shore, "they 
may have the talent to be a writer." 

For Iledglings in the bUSiness, 
she suggests they come in on the 
potluck night to try il out. "111at's 
what that night is ror," said Shore. 
"And if they get a wonderful feel -
ing within themselr that tells thcm 
that they found a place for their 
person. A lot or them, when Ihey 
arc just starting out, don't know 
who they are or what 's wrong with 
thei r lire. When they get out there, 

if they get that feeling within 
themselves that, 'Gosh, I need to 
have thi s kind of lire.' then they go 
on to develop. 

" It 's se lf-inspection so to 
speak. It 's what you're all about. 
You find out about yourself. It has 
to be indi vidual hecause what you 
do up there is be yourself. A lot of 
comics are impressionists in Ihe 
heginning, but as they mature, 
they begin to develop their own 
style. It 's training. like going to 
sc hool, like joining the army. You 
have to release your inner feelings , 
your inner problems and find the 
funny side of your desperation." 

The Comedy Store, with li S 
low cei ling and dark lighting, 
gives the Illusion or being on an 
elcgant cruise ship; the ride. com-
plete with a full bar menu and light 
fare , i a classy one. 

To make a good thing beller, 
people of all ages are welcome. 
Yes, that 's right. one need not be 
21 or older to get in. This is a big 
step in the right direction since La 
Jolla is nOlorious for alienating the 
under-2 1 crowd. 

For now, the onl y nighl The 
Comedy Store will be do~ed IS 
Tuesday. After the first of the year, 
Shore hope;, to put on comedy 
Iheme shows like "Guido Guido 
Guido" with all Italian stand-ups, 
or all Latino or all Jewish, etc. 

With proper identification stu-
dents can enter two-ror-one 
Wednesday. Thursday and Friday

thinks they have what it takes to 
make the audience laugh can per-

Tritons Not Ready For Jump To Division I 
TROUNCED: The stage was set for an upset last Tuesday night at RIMAe Field where the Tritons faced off against Division 
I cross-town rival usn. The Tritons battled valiantly, but the scholarshipped Toreros proved to be too much in a 5-1 defeat

it, Ihey hoth hap-
pen. A good 
exa mple or the 
dreaded dua l 
dumpin g 
occ urred la~t 
Tuesday night at 
RIMAC Field. 
The UCSD men '~ 

~oeee r team took 
the fi eld that cvening again ~ t the 
Toreros from the Univer~ lI y 01 San 
Diego and lo~ t 5- 1. 

building momentum and develop-
ing more chemistry with every 
match. 

From Ihe opening kickoff, 
th ough, il was apparent that the 
Tritons were overmatched. 

"They were just like lightening 
down the line~ ," As~i\tant Coach 
Ted Przyby lek said. 

For mo~t of the lir~t half, how-
ever. the Triton., played the Toreros 
to a .,ta lemate. Impre<"i ve defen-
\Ive play from .,weeper John 
Brandon, Rohert Be\\ler. Don 
Voogd and goalkl.:epl.:l Luca\ 
Curtolo kept the Tritom anoat. 

UCSD refused to give III to 
USD\ pre~sure. The Torero, kept 
"pn:ad,ng the field and they finally 
hrokt.: th rough in the 1lJth mlllute 
with an I.:xtremely lucky goal. 

back onlO the che,t of a USD strik-
er, who wa, inche~ from the goal. 

Now that they were down 1-0. 
the Tritons had to stiffen up. But 
less than a minute laler, the Toreros 
struck again with a chance goa l. 

Two lucky goa l ~ , but nevcrthe-
b~ the Triton~ were down 2-0 al 
the hair. In the second half, the 
Tntons fough t va liantly. 

The Torero,. howeve r, added 
three more goal, to their tally. It 
wa~ 5-0 m the 661h minute, and 
thing, lookcd like they were goi ng 
to get ugly. But to it, credit , CSD 
fought back and , hut the Torero, 
down for the rest of the way. 

They eve n added a nice hustle 
goal lrom lorward Brady Bernard, 
who harely beat an overconfident 
kceper to Caml.:ron Adam, ' loh. 

II wa\ a rough gilmc for the 
Tnton, m most re~pect~ - every

In short. I WANT THE DAMN

to he a household name. How 
do I attain such status'! The 
same way everyone else did: 
through greed. There's only one 
way to get the glory we alt 
deserve in life, by being greedy! 

One might want to argue that 
star athletes arc greedy because 
they have heen spoiled by the 
fast-paced culture of profess ion-
al sports and have Inflated opin-
ions of themselves . I think it's 
the other way around. Their 
greed is what makes them 
superstars and gelling spoiled 
with a great life is the reward. 

Someone passed the bait to 
guys like Grant Hill from grade 

~chool to college. Would he be 
in the NBA now if he had 
always passed it back'! Big lime 
players make big time plays and 
to make big time plays you have 
to have the ball and to get the 
ball you have to be greedy 
(whew). 

Who the hell wanls to be the 
wind beneath someone's wll1gs'! 
I want 10 be the damn eagle!

UCSD's Search For Chelsea 
STANFORD: The Tritons traveled to the NorCal tournament last weekend where they got no love 
from the first daughter, but moved up to a No.8 NCAA ranking with an 8-4 victory over UCSB 
By Jonah NIIenlon 
Co ASSOCIate Sports EdItor 

The UCSD men\ waler polo 
team traveled to Sian ford 

Uni ver~ lI y this weekend and, , ur-
pri!>lI1gly, no one 
on the leam 
hooked up with 
Chelsea Cllilton. 
She is Ihe slar 
attraction of 
Sianford now. IS 
she not '! Oh well. 
the Tritons didn'l 
have ti me for it 

anyway (not 10 mentIOn they would 
have heen shot by the Secret 
Service). Afler all . they had a big 
toumamenlto play in . 

The tournamer.l thai brought the 
Tritons and their six-game Winning 
streak to the Bay Area was the 
NorCal Tournament. hosted by 
Stanford. The tournament featured 
most of Ihe country 's top 15 te.llns, 
all vying for a spot in the champi-
onship game. For the Tritons a 1-3 
showing over the weekend dashed 
their hopes of reaching the champi-
onship w ntest. 

Even though their record was a 
disappointment , the Trilons 
retained their rank.ing because of 
their ~ole victory. 

The one Win came against UC 
• Santa Barhara. Ihe team the Tnlons 

had been itching to avenge Ihem-
selves upon for week.s. II was time 
to put up or shut up versus the team 
to whom they had blown a two-
point lead 111 the fourth quarter. 
This time, they played strongly the 
entire game and, in doing so, 

moved up to a No.8 ranking in the 
NCAA poll . 

Sophomore Ross Mecham 
scored three pOints In Ihe game to 
add 10 leammale Gordon Beh's 
two-point and one-point goa ls. 
Romas Kudirka got In on the action 

the second en roule 10 a 15-5 win. 
Highli ghts for the Tritons 

included senior Adam Bollenbach 's 
three points in the game. including 
a two-point ·hot. In additi on, 
Beemer had 15 saves. 

On Sunday. the Tritons were 
v,i lh two goab of 
hiS own. SenIOr "Gordon Beh 

strong in the first 
half against UC 
Irvine and man-
aged to get ahead 
with a 3-2 lead. 

goali e Pat Beemer 
made I I ~aves ; 
over Ihe weekend. 
he made a IOtal of 
45 ~aves . 

"Gordon Beh 
scored a bUl.zer 
beater 111 the third 
quarter to put us on 
top," Head oach 
Denny Harper 
said. "Give credit 
to Romas 
[Kudirka] for 
working hard 

scored a buzze,. 
beater In the 
third quarter to 
put us on top," 
Harper said. 
"Give credit to 
Romas for work-
Ing hard Inside 
and opening up 
the shot." 

From Ihere. 
things went down-
hill as UCI used its 
size advantage to 
throw UCSD 
around . Beh had 
another good game 
with two goals, of 
which one was a 
two - point e r . 
Irvine's second-
half dominance 

II1slde and opening up the shol for 
Gordon. His skip shot in the upper 
comer put us up 6-4 10 start the 
fourth quarter and from there we 
played awesome. Sanla Barhara 
had very few. if any. opportunities 
to score afler thaI." 

was unstoppable, however. as it 
dropped UCSD with an I 1-4 loss. 

"[The referee] treated us as if it 
were a hockey game," Harper said. 
"At one point Gordon and UCl's 
guy went under water and when 

they finally came up Gordon got 
punched. II was a typically physical 
game for Irvine. This is how they 
play the game. They make up for 
their shortcomings with thei r size 
and physicality." 

The second game on Sunday for 
the Tritons was also a disappoint-
ment. They suffered a 9-4 defeat at 
the hands of the University of the 
Pacific. They went one-for-nine on 
man-up opportunities, 14 percent 
on shooting and averaged just 
under 10 turnovers per quarter. 
With these numbers, UCSD didn 't 
have a shot at winning. 

"The games against UCI and 
UOP were definitely games we 
could have won," Bollenbach said. 
"But, we put together good halves 
instead of good entire games." 

While they didn ' t spot Chelsea 
or any Secret Service Agents lurk-
II1g in Bushes or Garbage 
Dumpsters, the Tritons hope to spot 
a win thi s Friday when they host 
Santa Clara University at 
Canyonview Pool at 6 p.m. With 
the postseason looming on the hori-
zon, every game is important. 

Following the uplifting win over 
the Gauchos, the Tritons suffered a 
harsh loss at the hands of 
Peppcrdine University. The Waves. 
the No. I ranked team in the 
NCAA, figured to munch the o. 9 
ranked UCSD squad. 

S.pt~ 18 at Stanford 

From the stan, it looked like a 
losing cause. The Tritons scored 
only one goal in the first half while 
Peppcrdine scored three limes in 
the first quarter and four more in
