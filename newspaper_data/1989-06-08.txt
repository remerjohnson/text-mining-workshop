A.S. Wins GPA Battle 
With Engineering Dept. 

By LAURA PROCTOR 
enior Staff Writer 

In a letter to the A.S. ouncil, 
the engineering department an-
nounced ye terday that admis ion 
procedures for engineering majors 
will now comply with sy temwide 
UC regulations concerning GPA 
calculations. 

Systemwide regulations state 
that for the first 16 units repeated, 
only the second course grade will 
be counted in a student's GPA. 
For pre-engineering students at 
UCSD, however, both grades are 
averaged together. 

Student Advocate Bard-Alan 
FinIan has argued that the differ-
ence between the engineering 
department's procedure and the 
systemwide policy is a direct vio-
lation of students' rights. 

A.S.Supports 
CSA Rally 

By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council passed 
two resolutions last night in 
support of the student lind 
protesters in China. 

One re olution specifically 
states that the "ASUCSD 
fuliy supports and endorses" 
a rally to be held today and 
tomorrow by the Chinese 
Student Association, the 
Chinese Scholars' Associa-
tion, and the Hong Kong 
Students' Association. 

Yesterday's letter follow the 
decision the Council made last 
week to allocate $360 to consult a 
lawyer about the legal rights and 
option pre-engineering st4dents 
have in the matter. 

According to A.S. Pre ident 
John Ramirezand Vice President 
Administrative Alex Wong, how-
ever, the policy change was not a 
direct result of the Council's deci-
sion to hire a lawyer. 
. '" don't think the lawyer had 
anything to do with it," Wong 
said. He said that in the past two 
weeks, he and Ramirez have met 
several times with administrators 
to discuss the issue. 

According to Wong, legal action 
was not necessary until all admin-
istrative solutions had been ex-
plored. He said that although the 
decision to hire a lawyer was not 
an unreasonable one, it was 
premature. 

"[Ramirez and I] pursued the 
administrative channel," he said. 
Wong added that neither he nor 
Ramirez applied pres ure to the 
administrators, but they did di -
cuss the issue with them. 

Ramirez sajd that he and Wong 
have met with both Chancellor 
Atkinson and engineering depart-
ment Dean Lea Rudee to inform 
them of student opinion on the 
issue. 

"They heard our concerns, and 
they agreed," Ramirez s' id. 

" It's exciting," Finlan said. "It's 
a victory for us. However, all 
skepticism considered, we don't 
know what it means." 

Finlan explained that because 
of the way the letter is worded, the 
outcome remains uncertain. 

The letter states that the engi-
neering department "will hence-
forth use the standard UC method-
ology to calculate grade point

averages whenever uch an aver-
age is used in their admi ion 
procedure." 

According to Finlan, the ys-
temwide policy might be changed 
in the fall . If the policy change is 
instated, he said, the engineering 
department could retain its cur-
rent procedures and still comply 
with the "standard UC method-
ology," as stated in the letter. 

"I hope it's not a ploy," Finlan 
said. 

Both Wong and Ramirez feel 
that the department intends to 
change its procedures, so that 
only the second grade is u ed in 
G PA calculations. Ramirez said 
he doubted that the administra-
tors are trying to "pull the wool 
over students' eyes." 

Students Urge Food 
Services Grape Boyco 
By JAMES MULLINER 
Guardian Intern 

A group of students is currently 
questioning UCSD Food Servi-
ces' decision not to honor the 
United Farm Workers' boycott of 
table grapes. 
. These students plan to hand a 

signed petition to Food Services 
and the A.S. Council this week, 
asking students and Food Servi-
ces to stop buying the boycotted 
grapes. 

COlt, Bordofsky also aid that 
euvironmental problems are 
caused when pesticides used on 
grapes enter the water table and 
food chain. 

Student Karen Kogel said that 
some of the pesticides are "oil 
based and they don't wash off 
with water." 

Kogel stated that "ignorance of 
the issues of the boycott i the 
main reason vhy some people do 
not support it." She stressed the 
importance of student awareness 
of the causes for the boycott . 

The other resolution dir-
ectly addresses the plight of 
the student and other pro-
testers in China, and con-
demns the Chinese govern-
ment. 

Calling the Chinese govern-
ment's killing of protesters a 
"cold blooded ma sacre," and 
the movement of the protes-
ters"'a brave and noble one," 
the resolution declares that 
"the ASUCSD vehemently 
condemns the atrocities com-
mitted by the Chinese gov-
ernment." 

. Controversial Surgeon to 
Head Transplant Program 

Team Will Arrive at UCSD in July 

According to Thaddeus Bor-
dofsky, one of the students 
re ponsible for the petition, the 
goal of the group is to "raise stu-
dent awareness about the grape 
boycott and to get the Food Ser-
vice to stop serving [grapes]." 

He characterized the group as 
"a bunch of tudents ... who iust 
want to help out"with the boycott. 

Director of Dining Services 
Brian Klippel said that it was a 
"policy of the Regent that we 
don't make policy deci ion for 
political reasons. 

"If students are concerned about 
the plight of farm worker ... then 
they should express that concern 
by not buying those particular 
products," he added. 

It further resolves that "the 
ASUCSD strongly urges the 
Chinese government to immed-
iately cease all violent action 
against the protesters and 
civilian of Beijing." 

The resolution expresses 
the ASUCSD' "support , 
olidarity, and sympathy"for 

the protesters in hina as 
well as "Chinese students at 
UCSD and around the 
world ."

U C Berkeley First to A ward 
Ph.D.s in Ethnic Studies 

; 

BERKELEY - Next month, UC Berkeley's ethnic 
studies department will award the nation's first Ph.D. 
degrees in that field . 

The ethnic studies doctoral program is the first and 
only such program in the nation. Since its creation in 
1984, the department has steadily gained stature and 
national significance, said Asian American studies 
Professor Ron Takaki. 

~Leading universities from all over the country -
Harvard , Yale, Brown and Wisconsin - are looking 
to Berkeley as a leader in ethnic studies curricula, and 
as a supplier of minority Ph.D.s trained in ethnic stu-
dies," Takaki said. 

The program's first Ph.D. graduates are Judy 
Antell and Ed Guerrero.

New UC Proposals Will Make 
Attaining Tenure More Dimcult 

BERKELEY - Being granted tenure at the Uni-
versity of California's nine campuses may become a 
little more difficult under proposed policy changes 
expected to take effect in July. 

Changes in the university' systemwide Academic 
Personnel Manual require that professors submit evi-
dence of teaching ability before becoming tenured or 
promoted. If approved, the manual will call for 
"clearly demonstrated evidence of high quality in 
teaching." 

The evidence would include comments and evalua-
tions from students from at least a majority of classes 
taught, and in the case of promotions to associate 
professor or full professor, commentary by other 
faculty . 

Circulated amonl( the nine campuses by the sys-
temwide Academic Senate's University Committee 
on Educational Policy, the proposed changes are not 
expected to meet much opposition, according to 
David Krogh, assistant chairperson of the senate.

conduct toward Gruber and his 
conduct toward others in her

Continued from page I 

The Council also debated sev-
eralappointments last night. Vice 
Prestdent External Mishka 
Migacz recommended seve ral 
people for positions, but the 
Council initially opposed her 
choices. 

Several council members claim-
ed that she had not advertised 
adquately for the openings, but 
after a special 10 minute recess 
and much debate, the appoint-
ments were approved. 

Joe Floren was appointed as 
the interim student advocate. 
Replacing Bard-Alan Finlan , 
Floren will hold the position dur-
ing the summer and will be up for 
re-appointment to the position in 
the fall quarter. 

According' to Jamieson's 
spokesperson Tom Forsythe, 
Jamieson denies having made any 
offensive remark, but said that he 
had complained in the past about 
Gruber's work. 

Jamieson is out of the country 
until July and the Guardian was 
unable to reach him for comment. 

Nolan said that "[Grubcr] tried 
to resolve her problems with 
Jamieson by telling him about the 
problems she and other nurses 
were having regarding his con-
duct ... He then took certain 
measures to create problems for 
her on the job. 

"I'd love to say all the things he 
did and said, but I can't give out 
the specifics because of restric-
tions . .. 1t11 all come out in court 
if we decide to sue pri vately or if 
any disciplinary action is taken by 
the University," Nolan said . 

Fruth stressed that "there i~ no 
lawsuit yet,just an allegation that 
hasn't been investigated, let alone 
proved. " 

Seven days after Gruber 's 
charges had been filed , three out-
side surgeons were brought in by 
the University of Minnesota "to 
find out if Dr. Jamieson was suit-
able to run his division or not ," 
according to John Najarian , the 
chief of surgery at the University 
of Minnesota's hospital. 

"When [the three doctors] talk-
ed to Dr. Jamieson they did not 
address tilt allegations, they only 
talked about them to the other 
people who had made the allega-
tions in the first place," Forsythe 
added. 

"It amounted to a trial without 
a n opportunity for Jamieson to 
present hi s side of the story," For-
sythe said . 

According to ajarian , he and 
Jamieson agreed that Jamieson 

NEWS 
should step down "until the air 
had cleared," due to the sexual 
harassment charge and other alle-
gations of following improper 
procedures. 

Due to the recommendations 
from the surgeons' report, how-
ever, the decision was made not to 
reinstate Jamieson. The surgeons ' 
report, according to Forsythe, 
found that Jamieson engaged in 
"disru ptive and rude behavior," 
did not follow hospital procedure, 
and devoted insufficient time to 
research and teaching. 

Forsythe commented, however, 
that "The rcport did not cite any 
specific circumstances of rude 
bchavior," and added that "Dr. 
Jamieson has disputed the hospi-
tal procedure charge. He explain-
ed the procedure he did and said it 
was more than appropriate. Dr. 
Jamieson did not follow a proce-
dure specific to the University of 
Minnesota only." 

Forsythe added that Jamieson 
was never asked about the amount 
of research that he had done even 
though he had produced 148 
research papers in a two-and-a-
half year period . 

Leslie Franz, of the UCSD 
School of Medicine public affairs 
office, said that Jamieson 's re-
cruitment has "involved honest 
di cuss ions regarding his tenure 
at th e Uni\<ersity of Minnesota 
and all of the incident that led up 
to his leaving. We feel ve ry com-
f()rt able offering him a po ition 
here. 

"The problem at Minnesota 
had to do with a disag reement 
regarding how the program hould 
be administered and d iffercnces 
of opinion," Fram said . 

Fra nL added that similar prob-
lems could arise a t UCSD but 
that it was doubtful because "Dr. 

Jamieson and [chairperson of 
surgery at the UCSD Medical 
Center] Dr. Mou sa have similar 
goals." 

UCSD's cardiothoracic surgery 
program, to be established at 
UC 0 by Jamieson , will include 
a heart and lung transplantation 
program. 

" Dr. Jamieson's duties will be 
similar to what he was doing in 
Minnesota ," Franz said . Jamie-
son will conduct cardiothoracic 
research and continue perform-
ing transplant surgeries, Franz 
said . 

Jamieson has performed some 
500 heart transplants and more 
than 50 heart transplants and 
more than 50 heart-lung trans-
plants. He is also one of the few 
surgeons in the world performing 
both single and double lung 
transplants, Franz said . 

"There aren't that many sur-
geons that perform these kinds of 
transplants, " Franz said . " Dr. 
Jamieson will be able to teach

young surgeons and residents 
things they could n't learn any-
where else, " she added . 

The School of Medicine has 
high hopes for its new transplant-
ation program. 

"With Dr. Jamieson's appoint-
ment, UCSD is cata pulting in to 
major clinical areas of excellence," 
UCSD Vice Chancellor for Health 
Services Gerard Burrow said. 

Franz said that throughout the 
controversy there was no doubt 
that Jamie on's program was very -
successful in terms of patient care. 

"H is kills as a surgeon and his 
complete dedication to his patients 
was never called into question,~ 
she said . 

"He has learned a lot from his 
experience at Minnesota and is 
anxious to leave that behind him 
and begin at a new setting where 
he can have a positive impact on 
patient care," Franz added.

Senseless Slaughter 

1 have a friend who works in the Revelle Cafeteria. She ~aw one 
student waiting in line for food who looked a little depressed, so in her 
typical perky way she said, "Be happy!" He answered, "I can't; I'm 
Chinese." 

This was typical of the hock and dismay around UCSD and around 
the world - and not just among Chine e - in the wake of the Beijing 
massacre. It wa ,as everal commentators have pointed out, Kent 

tate a thousand times over. We'd been watching these charismatic 
young kids, so committed to their cause, so far away - and so like 
ourselves. A leader of the students was very seriou about hi cause 
when he was interviewed on the network news, but at the end he 
couldn't resist asking if any of the girls in America had noticed him. 
Just a kid; he is probably dead now. 

So much hope destroyed . It wasn't entirely unexpected. When 
Chinese-American students had a march here at UC D recently, 1 
spoke with one of the organizers. I asked him what he thought would 
happen, and he said grimly, "The history of the Communist Party is 
violent repre sion ." But he added that he hoped this time it would be 
different, that real progre~s could be made. 

I once had a roommate from Vietnam named Vien . This was at 
Amona State Univer ity, before I transferred to UCSD. He was 
45 year old. 

" 
" 

--........... -

I 
- I 

As time pa sed, he told me more about Vietnam. He told me how 
when South Vietnam collapsed, he had a chance to come to the U.S. -
he was on a general's staff in the South Vietnamese Army - but he 
returned to Saigon to get his family . He was captured and , in the end, 
he had to leave his family behind. 

His family had saved for years to get enough money to bribe a guard 
at the "re-education" camp to allow Vien to escape; he weighed 90 
pounds when he left the camp and made his way to Indonesia 
and then the United States . Vien said that one reason he liked college 
was Jhat it helped him forget . 

1 don't think Vien was probably surprised by what happened. He had 
experienced tyranny first hand ; he had watched what had happened in 
neighboring Cambodia when the Chinese helped Pol Pot to come to 
power. He had een killing fields: he'd huddled in a boat with refugees 
desperately trying to escape. His son, who escaped several years after 
him, had walked to Thailand , across battlefields, seeing things no 
14-year-old hould have to witness. 

The thrilling promise of the Chinese students' protest is gone now. 
China is in danger of anarchy and total civil war - at the very least, violent 
repression will be necessary if the government is to maintain power. 
And certainly all the freedoms in the rest of the communist world, all 
the slow reforms and careful glasnost are in jeopardy now. Without a 
doubt, hardliners in the Kremlin are even now saying to Gorbachev, 
"Look at the road you are leading u~ down." 

In last week's Time Magazine, Charles Krauthammer wrote 
of the thrill of watching the protest , and the freedoms opening up 
around the world . But he also cautioned that the genie could be put 
back into the bottle, that Hungarians in 1956 and the Czechs in 1968 
had found this out the hard way. Now it has happened in C hina, and 
the "Beijing Spring" is over. And darkness is in danger of closing over 
the Chinese people again, just as it did over Vien 's people a decade and 
a half ago. All because the Chinese government decided to respond to 
non-violent protest with tanks and AK-47s.

The Massacre in Tian An Men Square 
Editor: 

June 3, 1989. Bloody aturd ay 
in Beijing, People' Republic of 
Chi na . S tudents in their quest for 
ba ic human rights were betrayed 
by their government when offi-
cials ordered the military to shoot 
the student protester in Tian An 
Men Square. 

The results were indescribable 
as thousands of students and 
innocent onlookers were merci-
lessly killed by their own People's 
Liberation Army. All over the 
world and in the United States, 
people have rallied against the 
Chinese government, while sup-
porting the students in Beijing. 

As a clu b representing the Chi-
nese students at UCSD, we, the 
Chinese Student Assoca tion, 
along with the Chinese Students 
and Scholars Association and the 
Hong Kong Student Association 
cannot help but feel for our 
brothers and sister in the P. R.C. 
and become involved in their 
cause. 

Since Tuesday, June 6, many 
of you may have noticed informa-
tion booths in Revelle Plaza, 

AP&M, and the Price Center, 
where you can obtain black arm-
bands in support of the students' 
cause. These booths will continue 
to be set up fo r the remainder of 
this week. 

In addit ion to these booths, ral-
lies will take place at the Price 
Center today and tomorrow at 11 
a.m., where various professors 
and students will speak. Furth-
ermore, today at 5:30 p.m. in 
Peterson H all 108, there will be a 
forum to discuss the demonstra-

tions in the P.R.C. 
The students in Beijing were 

massacred because they asked for 
basic human rights . As residents 
and ci ti zens of a country that 
repre ent the free world, we ca n-
not just sit back and watch a 
quarter of t he world's populatio n 
suffer. Please stop by one of our 
boot hs and show your concern . 
The students need all the support 
they can get. Thank you.

Endangered 'Wildlife' 
Editor: 

As many people know, the 
widely ad vertised "Wildlife Party" 
scheduled for last Friday night 
was cancelled at the last minute 
because of undue pressure from 
the U SO admini tration. It· a 
shame that it has gone so far 
as to extend the enforcement of 
the on-campus alcohol policy to 
off-campus events. 

Had administrators contacted 

us first , they would have learned 
that we had permission to use the 
land, and that all of the necessary 
permits were on file with the City 
of San Diego and the San Diego 
Police Department. Unfortunate-
ly, they decided to go over our 
heads and we oon found out 
from outside sources that our 
charter was in jeopardy. 

The Wrath of Grapes 

We regret that we were unable 
to fulfill your plans on Friday, 
and we hope that you realize what 
a dangerous precedent has been 
set. If the school can use its power 
to cancel a legitimate a nd legally 
planned off-campus event, what 
is the future of the already falter-
ing social life at UCSD? 

Editor: 
We are writing in response to 

the' fact that our money is being 
spent at the expense of people's 
lives. UCSD Dining Services 
continue to support California 
grape growers who are using over 
100 different pesticides, totalling 
8 million pounds, on the grapes. 
Additional dangerous chemicals 
can drift to grapes from their 
application in adjacent fields . 

Many pesticides sprayed on 
grape have an oil base and can-
not be washed off by co nsumers. 
Nationally, 300,000 farm workers 
are poisoned each year from pes-
ticide application . As concerned 
students and citizens, we are ask-
ing that the UCSD Dining Serv-
ices discontinue serving fresh Cali-
fornia grapes; pesticides are not 
used on raisins and most wine 
grapes. 

When asked if the DiningServ-
ices would be willing to join the 
boycott, Brian Klippel, director 
of Dining Services, explained that 
the Dining Services would not 
stop serving any food for political 
reasons. However, in the article 

titled "Campu -Wide Styrofoam 
Ban Sought," (Guardian, ov. 7) 
Klippel stated , "UCSD is a tech-
nologically progre sive university. 
We're in the forefront in that 
respect, and we should be in the 
forefront in ecological issues. We 
decided [eliminating styrofoam] 
is the righ t thing to do." He also 
expressed his hopes to see the 
"whole campus move in that 
direction. " 

In another interesting quote 
that we dug up from this article, 
Klippel commented that, "Like 
smoking, UCS D took a progres-
sive stand. We want to promote a 
styrofoam-free enviro nment like 
asmoke-freeenvironment .. . . Public 
universities have an obligation to 
do their part." Why can't UCS D 
be on the forefron t of the grape 
boycott and take a progressive 
stand? How ca n Klippel claim 
that this· "obligation" no longer 
applies? 

Please join us in a campus-wide 
ban on fresh California table 
grapes.

Troubles 
Editor: 

We, as members of the 1989 
Intercollegiate Softball Team, 
would like to clear up the allega-
tions addressed towards our pro-
gram and coaches by Julie War-
tell (Guardian, May 30). 

We feel a tremendous injustice 
has been committed by an indi-
vidual who was not even a member 
of this year 's squad . Ms. Wartell's 
speculative opinions of the coach-
ing staff and ongoing activities of 
the team are not shared by actual 
team members, and are unworthy 
of rebuttal. 

For the most part, we had a 
positive season both on and off 
the field, and not the negative 
experience Ms. Wartell blindly

The UCSD Guardian OPINION Thursday, June 8, 1989 5 

Q and A: What actions should the U.S. take against the Chinese government 
following last weekend's conflict? 

Bush s actions so far, 
stopping arm sales, have 
been pretty impressive. May-
be more diplomatic or eco-
nomic pressure would be 
appropriate. 

Dan Mulville 
Senior, Muir 

Urban Studies and Planning 

Nothing. Carter 's grain 
embargo didn 't work against 
the USSR; sanctions didn 't 
topple apartheid. Leave the 
Chinese alone; offer moral 
support. It is a Chinese mat-
ter. The will of a people 
cannot be repressed by guns 
and tanksforever. We learn-
ed this in Vietnam, Afghani-
stan (twice), and Nicaragua, 

Byron Gutierrez 
Senior, Revelle 

Mathematics 

Photos and interv~ews by Bryan Bilyeu 

The United States Con-
gress, in a combination with 
the President, should pass 
all-encompassing economic 
sanctions against China. All 
means necessary should be 
used to end the merciless 
slaughter and let freedom 
reign. 

Douglas Alden 
Senior, Revelle 

Mech. Engineering 

~~~~~----.------------~~~~~~~~- --

Since what is happening 
in China is strictly an inter-
nal affair of the Chinese 
people, the U.S . shouldn 't 
fully interfere. However, 
since what the central gov-
ernment is doing is inhu-
mane, a limited economic 
sanction and diplomatic 
pressure should be applied 
to the Chinese government 
to solve their problem with-
out more bloodshed. 

Paulos Hailemichael 
Junior, Third 
Biochemistry 

The U. S. must condemn 
any actions of this severity. 
Not just publica/ly or politi-
cally, but with recourse that 
will directly be felt inter-
nally al the highest level of 
Chinese government.

missed by all at UCSD. 

Bard-Alan Finlan, the A. .

working since the day he took 
office. Bard-Alan is responsible 
for bringing new life to the Stu-
dent Advocate's Office, and with 
the help of his many assistants, 
produced a strong direction for 
the A.S. Council to follow in 
regard to student rights. 

He ha helped, on an individual 
basis, a great number of students 
solve dispu tes / enta nglements wit h

Bard-Alan. He puts his best foot 
forward - and stands on it! 

The Women's Resource Center 
has had a great history here at 
UCSD, but the work, lectures 
and services that have come from 
the WRC office this year have been 
exceptional. K.nowing that this is 
an all-volunteer organization 
(service) and that funding is 
dependent upon the A.S. as well 
as a few other groups, I am just 
amazed with the service this year! 

I really hope the administra-
tion starts to kick in (money) and 
upport this service for the better-

ment of everyone, students, staff, 
faculty, men and women alike. To 
all the WRC supporters, hang in 
there!

Although it may appear that the

have the btst relationship, I'm 
here to tell you that it's true. We 
don't. And thank God for it!

UC Regents Seek New Campus Sites 
The University of California 

has announced it will enter into 
contract negotiations with a con-
sulting group to assist the Univer-
sity in identifying potential sites 
for possible new campuses . 

Over the next year, the consul-
tants will evaluate regions and 
sites throughout the state of Cali-
fornia in terms of how well they 
meet physical campus criteria. UC 
President David P. Gardner pres-
ented the Regents with a prelimi-
nary list of physical criteria, which 
will be forwarded to the Regents 
for formal action at a future Board 
of Regents meeting. 

These preliminary physical cri-
teria address issues in transporta-
tion, demographics, housing, geol-
ogy and topography, site appeal, 
public support, the environment, 
site availability, utilities and gen-
eral size. Other criteria, such as 
those affecting the academic pro-
grams or economic feasibility of 
constructior., will be presented 
and considered at a later date. 

No decision will be made on 
new campuses or their preferred 
sites until all long-range devel-
opment plans for the existing 
eight general UC campuses have 
been approved by the Regents . 

The consulting team will be 
asked to assist in the completion 
of the physical site evaluation 
criteria developed by the task 
force , then to collect data about 
and identify possible sites, and to 
refine the possibilities down to a 
short list through in-depth analy-
sis . Based upon this analysis, as

ofthe issues, regardless ofwhether 
they support the boycott or not. 

"I think once peop'le learn about 
the issues and learn about the 
hazards of pesticides . . . and the 
potential health hazards of the 
consumers that eat the grapes, 
they will ~nderstand and realize 
the importance of boycotting the 
grapes," Ramirez said. 

Bordofsky fee ls the Food Ser-
vices' ban on styrofoam cups lends 
support to his position, because 
pesticides and styrofoam both 
adversely affect the environment. ' 

According to the students cir-
culating the petition, they have 
collected over 900 signatures. They 
plan to present the petition to 
Food Services later this week. 

well as consideration of academic 
and fi.nancial factors , the task 
force will advise the President on 
potential sites. Gardner will then 
present his recommendation to 
the Regents. 

to the consultallts. 

Gardner told the Regents that 
in order to keep the expense and 
expectations of prospective site 
sponsors to a minimum, the eva-
luation process will proceed with-
out regard to formal proposals 
from interested parties. Informa-
tion which a community, organi-
zation or individual submits to 
the University will be forwarded 

It is estimated that up to 63,000 
additional students will have to be 
accommodated in the University 
of California between now and 
the year 2005. The President 's 
own projection , based upon pre-
liminary estimates of capacities at 
current campuses, suggest a need 
to place about 20,000 of those 
additional students on new cam-
puses - he has recommended 
that up to three be developed . The 
Regents are expected to consider 
action on new campus options in 
late 1990 or early 1991.

It seems unfair. The genius had all that time. While you have a few

Harly successful, resulting in an 
alliance with Elektra Records in 
the U.S. 

Perhaps the most intriguing as-
pect about the band is their origin . 
Altho ugh no one people or coun-
try holds a monopoly on great 
music, few could have predicted 
that one of 1988's most engaging 
bands would arise from the tiny, 
isolated nation of Iceland. 

Iceland is a society with deepl y. 
rooted beliefs in magic, spirits, 
and ghosts. This sense o f the 
supernatural attracted the interest 
of British avant-rock bands like 
the Fall, Psychic TV, and Killing 
Joke. 

"Geographically, you have to 
remem ber, Iceland is very you ng," 
Bjork , the Sugarcubes's vocalist , 
explained to New Musical Express. 
" !t 's right on the cracks that hold 
the Atlantic Ocean. And because 
it 's so new, it's erupting with lava 
all the time. It hasn ' t got any defi-
nite form, and that's why people 
are so into the m ystic and para· 
normaL "

"Somebody that doesn '[ threaten the status qoo In thIS business is guaranteed 
success, and thac's fine. Let them be happy wllh chat. Thac isn'c my rouee at 
all. " 

-Johnny Lydon 
Jo hnn y Lydon can never be accused of conforming to anyone's ideas 

of acceptability. In 1975, he donned the name Johnny Rotten and, with 
rhe help of the Sex Pistols, fo rced the world to nOtice the punk 's answer 
to bellbottoms and disco. Although the cu l~ura l eruptio!) was short 

Sugarcubes Melt The Ice 
The music rea lly does sound as 

if the band has tapped into some 
sort of spi ri tual energy. The wail· 
ing trumpet lines swirling around 
the chIldlike voice, laced with 
deep sexuality and pa~ lon, art' 
unusual and profound. The ~rllld· 
ingguitars and power rhythms are 
like a pulsating heart, loud and 
sensual. The lYriCS arc rich In 
imagery and emotion.

"Deus" - the Sugarcuhes 

uch poetl s are not unusual on 
the Sugarcuhe album, LIfe's Too

sense to nonsense, juggles WIth

Certainly the Sugarcuhes arc 
one of the most exciting and innova· 
tive bands to emerge on the musIc 
scene in the past five years. Their 
fi rst single, "Birthday," was re-
leased in 1987 on England's One 
Little Indian Records . 1t shot to 
the top of the U. K. independent

unequalled since the appearance

OPENS IN THEATRES JUNE 30TH 



Thursday. June 8. 1989 

T his is for all you 1M junkies, the infamous Empty Beer Can 
Awards. These awards are given 
to all of you who have done 
something worth honoring or 
something immensely embarass-
109 over the past year. So for all 
you dId, these EBC Awards are 
for YOU!! 
Best Male Athlete in IM's-
Gordon S hiring (all teams). Talk 
about an all-around guy. thIS 
guy played every sport here at 
UCSD except badminton. (I 
heard he was playing Ja i Alai 
that night down on the Tijuana 
Frontori.) He not only played 
them. he was most likely the 
best player on the field. And he 
finally won the thing he wanted 
most - not Barbara- but the 1M 
waterpolo championship. 
Best Female Athlete in 1M's -
Linda Ross. As has been the 
case in the past. the person who 
wins the I M Superstars contest ' 
is one of the top athletes on 
campus. Well , that is definitely 
the case this year. Linda not 
only won the Women's Super-
stars but shallered the record by 
a couple of hundred points. She 
also led her coed basket ball 
team to their championship and 
will in the Coed AAA V B title 
game. 

Dunlap-O~er-the-Belly Spare 
Tire of the Year - This is given 
yearly to the person who most 
enjoyed his meals. all eight of 
them a day. This year the award 
goes to Hudson Elliot . Hudson 
has actually had great training. 
H is brother weighed 165 when 
he came her and was at 265 
when he graduated eight years 
later. Hudson has always 
wanted to be like his BIG 
brother. 

Be~t Unies in IM's - Hands 
down for Swim Fals in thi 
category. They won it in their 
own inimitable style. This team 
usually had a theme for every 
night. TheIr normal outfits were 
Speedos (men's or women'~) . 
They have gone from a stylish 
bra and panty ensemble to a 
more racy one- complete nud-
ity! Guys, you're awesome. 
CSE (Community Ser~iu 
Officer) of the Year - Again 
another well-earned award to 
the CSO who watches the most 
I M games each year and tries to 
snake out of his job the most. 
The Yellow Jacket this year IS 
awarded to Cary Ihll, Wear II 
with pride and I can't believe 
you get paid for doing what you 
do. 
Sandbaggers of the Year - The 
team Hint of Musk in Coed A 
Hockey must have retired the 
award for being the worst sand-
baggers of all time. What did 
they do? They play Coed A 
hockey with mostly an AAA 

team. Worst of all, after a thrill-
ing win (yawn ... ) one of their 
players (Scott 'Sandbag' Plas-
r.lan) was heard to ay "this is 
the best win I've ever had in 
IM·s." Gee, I think that's the 
same thing Sitting Bull said . 
Best Individual A ttitude in 
IM's - This goe- to the person 
who goe out of his way to make 
1M 's a pleasant experience not 
only for himself but for eve-
r one around him. Winning and 
losing take a back sea t for t his 
person having a good time is 
what it's about. This year's 
reCIpient is or M r. Nice Guy 
Shin ~Puka Shells" Mirheshimi, 
What a guy! 
Best Team Attitude in IM's -
This i for the team that always 

plays with the true spirit of 
IM's- fun and enjoyment . This 
team never argues a call, always 
shakes hands after a game, never 
tau", an opposing player and 
never brags about their abilities. 
M ost of all, t hey never write a 
letter to the editor complaining 
about what yours truly says in 
the Bud Page. This goes to my 
friends from the lnd- Year Med 
Schoo/teams. I guess that can-
cels my free liver transplant , huh 
guys? 
Airheads of the Year - This one 
goes to those who have a ten-
dency to have their heads above 
the ground, as in WAY above 
the ground. It's shared by the 
lofty duo of Matt Rochinos and 
Greg Taylor. T hese two can 
always remember a phone 
number they get at a bar, but 
can never seem to remem ber 
when they were supposed to 
officiate their intramural games. 
Mr. Punctuality A ward - This 
goes to the guy who forfeits the 
most games in 1M's. De Mai is 
that guy. H e won't even make it 
to his own funeral on time! 

1M Hockey Players Worst 
Enemy - to Maynard Dummes-
dale for not allowing the stu-
dents to even have a chance t() 
vote on a new Rec facility. 
Because of that all indoor partic-
ipants are stuck playing at all 
hours of the night. 
I'm Superman A ward - This one 
goes to the on ly man on this 
campus that actually tried to run 
through a glass door, Matt 
" Kryptonite" Randolf. Mall, it 
was a good effort, but you for-
got your cape . I suggest you try 
opening the door first next time. 
It's better for the body. 
I Always Wanted to Work for .. 
the Physical Plant Award - to 
the guy who~e se(.ret desire wa~ 
to wear a tool belt and drive a 
Cushman. not study all day and 
night. Well dreams became real-
ity for Jason ~ Jailhouse Rock " 
Moran. He happened along an 
unattended Cl'shman after a 

couple of six-packs of courage 
one night- and the dream came 
true. A Cushman of his very 
own, until UCSD 's finest 
decided it was back to the 
library for Jason. 

The Eric Turner A ward -Named 
in honor of a past I M official. 
He had a horrible habit of j ust 
ripping into any official who 
would work his game. He was a 
nightmare to work for. This 
year the award goes to Matt 
~ I'm Finally an American" 
Zehner. He ripped into officials 
like The Fridge rips into a 
steak. 

Hairdressers of the Year - Goes 
to Andy Walslan and Brian 
Hutchens. two guys who really 
know how to fix a guy's doo. 
They were unhappy with their 
roomates hairdoo and were out 
of mousse, so they decided to 
use the next best thing. That's 
right folks, they p issed on his 
head while he lay passed out. 
Drunk of the Year - Scotty 
Morita. Talk about a guy who 

can't hold his booze. but he can 
sure hold his best friend 's boob. 
This guys headed right for 
Raleigh Hills Rehab. 

The Methuselah A ward - Goes 
to the 1M participa nt who has 
played in the I M program the 
longest. T his was an ea yaward. 
How many people do you know 
that haven't missed a game in 
sixteen years of play? Well, there 
is one. one other than Frank 
" Gramps" Vernon. He is an 
institution unto himself. 
Best 1M Referee - Ann HaUey 
for her outstanding work in 
Innertube Waterpolo . She has 
had to work some tough games, 
AAA and Fraternity Tourney, 
and has handled it all with ease. 
Amy got every vote of the poll-
sters except Sam Bloom's. 
1M Red Cross A ward - This 
goes annually to the individual 
who just can't stay out of the 
training room. T he guy. John 
"Sam Bowie" Fox, really wants 
to play, but sympathy is more 
important than winning for Big 
John. Hey, the ladies like to give 
ma.s ages to poor old John. Do 
you blame him? 
Best Fraternity in IM's - Three-
peat, the Phi Delta Thetas, Ca n 
you imagine? They were totally 
out of it. The Sigma Pi 's and the 
ZBT's had the banner won. All 
they had to do was win one little 
softball game and they would 
have been the first fraternity 
evet to win a banner other than 
the Phi Delts. But the old Linda 
Lovelace syndrome crept in and 
the Ph i Delts stole the banner 
with a great comeback. Great 
job, guys. How 'bout next year?

1M Dept Student Assistants 
Well, it has been an outstanding year, but like all 

good things. it must come to an end. I n this last edition 
of the Bud Team for '88-'89. I would like to thank the

SOFTBAll BudMan's 1989 1M All-Stars 
ThiS IS the long awaited 1M-All-Star softball team. ThIS IS the best 

of the best , the cream of the crop of the 250 softball teams here at 
UCSD 
Catch~,. Paul St~in. Nam~ H~,e. A v,.-.500. HR-5, RBI-80 
ThIS guy can play the pOSlllon He doesn 't have the great wheels 
so he has found himself a home al home. He blocks the plate belter 
than Scoscla, IS qUicker than Carter, and has a better arm than 
Santiago The best thing about Paul IS hiS ability to dIstract the 
hitters With hiS Henny Youngman jokes. 
I B-DanllY Cos"ov~. Tau Kappa Epsiloll. A v, .-.350. HR -l. RBI·l0 
Normally you like your flrsl sacker to be more offesnively oTlented 
(not that he Isn 't-off the field), but thIS guy can handle the glove at 
flTst He has saved many a game With hIS gleat Garvey-like scoops 
of errant throws 
lB-Brad Sti,/in,. Capt. Fo,cuturs. Av,.-. f75. IIR ·5. RBI40 
The key to a gOOd second baseman IS hiS ability to turn the deuce 
If you have a sweet second sacker who can turn the deuce your 
squad can get out 01 a lot of big Innings. Well. Brad can do It betler 
than most HIS sty le IS more like a baby elephant, but who cares 
when the lob gets done. Here 's some peanuts for a great lob, Brad. 
SS·Stacy Sasalt.i, Su,ars Sweet. A v,.-.490. HR-8. RBI44 
The best way to start a team IS to acqUIre a great shortstop The 
one I would take fIrst IS UCSD's Wizard 01 Oz, Stazle Sazakl ThIS 
gal can really play Great glove, great arm and best of all , great 
wheelsl You shOUld see her at Torrey's on Monday nlghtsl 
3B-Stev. Koch. I Don 't Wallt ~;rr With K~n Stttt~,

You gotta have balls to play the hOI corner Old Stev~ has got 'em, 
and he s so cockle that he doesn 't even wear a cup That's how 
gOOd the dude IS No one can handle the hOt corner like Steve 

LF-Phil TIIIt. P,o/oathldics. Av,.·.600. HR -15. RBI-lOS 
When you talk power you talk Babe Ruth When you talk great 
power at UCSD you have to talk to PhIl Tan. Phil is the all -time 
home run hitter here at UCSD Boy can he hit 'em. He hit the first 
home run at the NCRA fIelds, and he has peppered the Revelle 
Apartments on Warren North. No one hits the softball farther. 
CF-Danfl Simon,. Roundb/JII~", A v/I.-.515. HR-4. RBI-S5 
Dana comes from a long line of great ballplayers. Dana will actu-
ally be the third In her famIly to be so honored on thiS hallowed 
team. Rumor has It that there IS stili one more Simone on the way 
We'll reserve a spot for the next Simone 
RF-Kay Duloclc, F~/icill Flaked. A"g.-. ISO. HR-I. RBI-S 
ThIS gal IS more noted for her play In soccer as the women 's 
leading scorer, but boy can she playa mean right fIeld This year 
she even caught a ball. Look for her to quilihe ICA soccer team 
and go cut for the women's softball team. Hey Katy, our loss Will be 
thelT gain. 
P-Josh Silv.r. W~ Hatt Josh. W·L 7-1, ERA-O.50 
ThiS guy IS the only pitcher In 1M history to throw a perfect game 
Not bad In slow pitch softball It ObViOusly wasn't a ffuke as he has 
pItched well all year 
Coach 0/ the y.er-Jordon Cook, Goodby. M,. S pauldin, 
If there ever was a dead nnger for th e fat little italian up north It IS 
Jordan Cook Jordan fIres up hiS team to Immense levels. He hugs 
hiS players , kisses them after a hOme run and does all the little 
things a great manager needs lodo You know, come to think of II, 
Lasorda IS actually thinner than Jordan now that he's lost all the 
weight Maybe Jordan should take over the Dodgers - he couldn't 
do any worse.

would be the only mustache to have 
traver~ed the Swiss Alps, the Cana·

Conflicting With The Sea 
by eric gustafson 

hiatus intern 

The MandevIlle Gallery is currently exhibiting a collection of oil 
paintings by Richard Bosman entitled, Gifts of Ihe Sea. The show runs 
through June 25. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday, 12 to 5 
p.m. 

Described as a "distln tly gifted new painter" by Peter Schjeldahl, 
RIchard Bosman exhibits rwo very different collections of his work. 
Although all the paintings in the exhibit involve the sea, there is an 
obvious and quite effective contrast between the paintings in the far half 
of the ga llery and the half seen immediately upon entering. The contrast 
corresponds to two distinct periods in Bosman's oeuvre, the first being 
from 1980- 1986 and the second from 1986-1988. 

The far end of the galle ry IS filled with human drama. The dominant 
theme, as pointed out by the artist at the show's reception, is the 
struggle of human beings against the forces of the sea. The best example 
of this appears in Pinnacle (1984) where Bo man shows men swarming 
vIctoriously out of the clutches of the sea o nto the safe perch of a small 
earthen peak. The frenzied swirl of ocean and people creates the founda-
tion of a plnnacl~ ot human struggle. .

The tension of this struggle is reinforced by the vigor with which his 
brush and knife apply the thick paint to the canvas. The unfinished 
,quality of his expressionistic strokes also adds to a sense of turmoil. 
Floating Head (1980) brings the struggle of humans with the sea to a 
macabre and final climax. Here a man has lost to the sea as his bleeding 
blue head floats in the foreboding green swirls of the 0 ean , his eyes 
open in shock. 

If one walks clockwise through the far half of the gallery , cnding with 
the di turbing Floating Head, the effect upon entering the other part of 
the gallery in one of soothing calmness . Adistanced tho ugh humanistic 
respect for the sea replaces the tension and turmoil of human truggle 
as the sea itself becomes the primary foclls . Thi contrast can best be 
seen in Dawn (1988) where the lower half of the painting evokes a 
meditative peacefulness. 

Though most of Bosman's paintings in this section do nor depict the 
ocean in a calm state, rhe o verall effect is to rurn the viewer 's thoughts 
from the didactic truggle of the other half of the exhibit to that of 
admiration of the sea. In doing so Bosman allows the viewer to make his 
or her own emotional associations with the paintings. It is through this 
shift that the overall soothing quality i created. 

tylistica lly in this part of the how, Bosman gives the surfaces o f the 
canvases the dynamism o f the sea, as crashing waves attempt to break 
from the confines of the canvas in thick blotches of oil, and gentle swells 
of paint blend subtly into the surface. 

Probably more interesting from a formalist perspective is the way 
Bosman subdivides rhese works. In Setl Stales (1988) the work is 
divided into 10 separate canvases. In asking the painter about his 
inspiration for this work, Bosman explained that he was attempting to 
paint hiS conception of the different levels of the Beaufort Scale (a cale 
on which successive ranges of Il'ind velocities are measured). Bosman 
also mentioned that he was attempti ng to break his paintings down into 
a sequential order as 10 a comic book or a movie . 

As on~ who truly loves the 0 ean, it was somewhat disapPOinting to 
talk to Bosman about the way he as embled his paInting. It would seem 
that the artl~t would see the ocean as a deeply Inspinng (orce'ln his ltfe. 
Howcver, thl~ deep seated respect did not come across in dL ClISSlon, 
though he did mention hIS father was a sea .:aptam. 

In palnllngs ltke Sea Slatt's the artist dId not pamt from a tual 
observed exrerience, hut from his imagina tion In o rder to fi t his own 
styltstic Ideal. For the most part It did not seem that the actual interac-
tion with the sea was the pnme inspiration behind his work, but style 
ItSelf. On this Id~alistlc level, Bosman treats the sea too much as a means 
to his own artistic ends, and not as a subjet that should be treated as an 
end in It elf. 

This Criticism does not take away from the overall merit of the show. 
The tran formanon between the two parts of the show and the evoca-
tive paintlOgs themselves are well worth a visit to Mandeville Gallery.

individuality," Lydon explained 
in a recent Los Angeles Times inter-
view. "Society always has its fac -
tion of rebels and individuals but 
at the moment I don't see any col-
lective uprising of individuality 
the way there was in mUSIL in the 
mid '70s. And that suits me fine. 
We don't need unified fronts ." 

As for current pop culture, 
Lydon seems to feel that the move 
towards "seriou .. music is merely 
the public's need to feel good 
about itself. "Pop culture gives 
people fa Ise expectation of life," 
Lydon mused . "[It] c vers up the 
wrongs of society and lulls people 
into a false sense of se urity. A 
Mado nna record will not save you 
from anything. As long as you're 
aware of that then go ahead and 
enjoy it. " 

With the recent Virgin release 
o( 9, the band's witty , acidic per-
sonaltty , kno wn and loved by 
many, seems to be somewhat sof-
tened. The album has its moments, 
albeit Lydon's vocals tend to get 
bur ied Within the mix. Perhaps It 
IS due to the chOICe of produLcr. 
Recorded In London, the a lbum 
wa produced by PiL, Stephan 
Hague (notorious (or hiS work 
with Pet hop Boys, O MD, and 
Erasure), and EriL Thorngren , 
Although the funk rhythms and 
talented musIcianship of guitarist 
John McGeoch and baSSIst Allan 
Dias make 9 worth a liste n, one 
may be hesitant before dishing out 
$14 for the compact disc. 

Yet their live show is something 
that must be experienced. Lyd-
on's stage presence, a long with the 
band's raw musical ability, creates 
a bond berween the performers 
and the audience. Public Image 
Ltd . reaches out and turns the 
audience (fans and casual watchers 
alike) into a gyrating, screaming 
melee of energy. Opening for last 
year's INXS "Kick" tour , PiL is 
currently on tour with New Order 
and the Sugarcubes. Joined by 
multi -instrumentalist Ted Chau, 
the band will perform at various 
North American arenas for six 
weeks this summ~r before moving 
on to Australia , New Zealand, and 
Japan . With the upcoming X-Fest 
on June 17, what better way to 
celebrate the end of finals and 
experience Public Image Ltd. for 
yourself?

must even wear a muscle suit to 
fill out hiS non-heroic frame. The 
backlash was such that it was even 
written up in The Wall Slreet 
Journal. 

To appease fans, Warner's sent 
out a big gun-Bob Kane himself. 
He did some good old-fashioned 
cheerleading at comic onven-
tions and the like, ailing this new 
version a "serious" Batman, and 
exhorting fans to give Keaton a 
chance. 

A lot 's riding on Keaton 's 
padded shoulders, but ount on 
Batmania revisited to prevail. After 
all, he can't be as awful as Lewis 
Wilson . 

The UCSD Guardian 

Assisting Teaching 
Editor: 
As a graduate student and a 

TA, ) find myself in sympathy 
with recent letters des,ribing the 
heavy demands placell on T As 
which affect the quality of section 
teaching. On the other hand , ) am 
also concerned that the (in my 
experience) false impression not 
be given that all grad student see 
teaching as a terrible pain in the 
neck to be avoided if at all 
possible. 

Among the graduate students I 
know, some are here because ofa 
primary interest in teaching; oth-
ers mainly to pursue particular 
research agendas . The great 
mdjority, however, are glad to 
have teaching experience and are 
actively striving to do the best job 
possible. 

Unfortunately, as Mr. Blake 
points out, graduate students are 
caught between pressure for more 
and better work from the faculty, 
who, after all, stand between us 
and a lifetime of flipping burgers, 
and complaints from our students 
that T As are unprepared or unin-
teresting. It is a self-perpetuating 
cycle: students coming ;nto a class 
with no pre-existing enthusiasm 
about the subject matter, con-
fronted by a distracted or under-
prepared T A, will of course 
remain unenthusiastic . 

With smaller sections, T As 
could spend less time grading 
papers and exams and devote 
more time to preparation and 
individual attention. Departments 
have a certain amount of leeway 
regarding section size, but the 
boltom line is funding; the admin-
i tration makes these decisions. 

When professors and T As have 
the resources to actually work 
individually with students instead 
of slapping grades on papers , 
that's when you'l see the kind of 
progress, inspiration, and learn-
ing neces ary for a real educa-
tional process to begin. 

Jennifer Wooddell 
Department of Political Science 

Maynard 
Continued from pale 6 
writers . The best thing about the 
media and government is that 
they allow for all viewpoints to be 
heard and decisions to be based 
upon a wide variety of representa-
tion. For it is only through con-
flict that true resolution can be 
achieved. 

Finally, to all of those students 
and organizations that really care 
about UCSD and the students of 
UCSD - ) just want to say, 
thanks.

T As their jobs), faculty members 
who care about what is really

TAs to teach the subjects that

Greenpeace to Rally at IWC Meeting 

By CATHERINE DILLE 
Staff Writer 

"There are few things as beauti-
ful as a whale ... and there are 
fewer of them every day," read a 
Greenpeace flyer urging the public 
to "say yes for whales in San 
Diego." 

Members of Greenpeace are 
holding a rally and march at the 
ite of the International Whaling 

Commi ion's (JWC) annual con-
vention in San Diego on June 12 
to call for the end of whaling. 

The IWC, made up of delega-
tions of scientists and people in 
the whaling industry from over 25 
countries, passed an indefinite 
moratorium on commercial whal-
ing that went into effect several 
years ago. 

Under a loophole in the current 
IWC laws. nations can issue them-
selve permits to kill whales for 
scientific reasons, specifically to 
learn more about whale popula-
tions. The three countries which 
have implemented these program 
- Japan, Iceland and orway 
are required to submit their scien-
tific findings at the I we conven-
tion annually. 

According to Dr. Sidney Holt, 
scientific advisor to the IWC 
delegation from Seychelles, both 
Iceland's re earch program - now 
in it fourth year - and Japan's 
- in its third - are annually 
condemned by the IWC for their 
lack of scientific relevance. 

"What [these nations] are doing 
is perfectly legal, but whether it is 
ethical is somethi ng else; and 
whether it is scientific is some-
thing else. The scientists have 
practically all said that the work is 

making no contribution what-
soever." 

orway's program, in its first 
year, will be reviewed by the IWC 
this June. 

Holt explained that the IWC 

ColdFusionDebate Presents 
Scientific, Moral Questions 

By LARA WRIGHT 
Guardian Intern 

Much ink has been spilt since 
late March when University of 
Utah scientists B. Stanley Pons 
and Martin Fleishmann an-
nounced that they had discovered 
cold fusion . 

On May 22, the UCSD Pro-
gram in Science Studies held a 
panel discussion which examined 
thIS multi-dimensional issue. 

UCSD Dean of Engineering 
M. Lea Rudee, one ofthe panelists, 
commented on the scientists ' 
decision to publish their findings 
in the Wall Streel Journal. 

In defense of their choice to 
publtsh in the Wall Street Jour-
nal, Rudee pointed out that this is 
not normal science but revolu-
tionary science. If a science jour-
nal article had been published, he 
explained, other scientists might

report on a panel discussion of cold 
fusion. Part one appeared June 5. 

have scooped the experiment fhe 
artIcle clearly establtshed intellec-
tual property rights without giv-
ing away the whole story. 

With this approach, the peer 
review system was circumvented . 
SCIentists will have to wait untIl a 
detaIled findings repon comes out 
in the Brittsh journal Nature. In 
this day and age of advanced 
communication , more scientific 
discoveries may go around the 
normal route of technical pub-
lications . 

Rudee explained that because 

the United States competes so 
well in high technology industrial 
sectors, science news has become 
more important to society. The 
United States funds research at 
much h igher levels than any other 
nation in the world. In t.his respect, 
the commercial im plications 01 

"What we are see-
ing is the politics of 
science. " 

- Bruno Latour 

cold fusion warrant publication 
In the Wall Street Journal . 
Rudee 's statement reflect the 
business community'S desire for 
knowledge of leading technolgy 
announcements, as well as the 
communications technologies 
which allow rapid dissemination 
of new knowledge into the press. 
Philosophy I social sciences Profes-
sor PhIlip Kitcher added that 
there are important economic 
market forces in the background 
fueli ng this proce~s of ~cientific 
discovery. Theseforces distort the 
pressure to publish, he explained . 

Sociology sCIence studie~ 
Profe~sor Bruno Latour ~aid, 
"Wha t weare seeing i the polittcs 
of science. In this case the report-
109 of the Jow-nal was quite 
detailed about dIspute regarding 
the announcement. Scientists are 
usually quite an agreeable lot, 
wtth occaSIOnal dIsputes between 
physici t and chemists about the 
nature of an experiment . What 
has this taught us about the nature 
of science?" 

I here have been few succes es 

in the replicating of experiments, 
but this does not erode the valid-
ity of the cold fusion announce-
ment. 

Kitcher addressed controversy 
created by scientists such as Pons 
and Fleischmann when their fel-
low scie ntists cannot replicate 
their experiments. He reported 
that the scient ists requested to 
print an article in Nature, but they 
were asked for further documen-
tation and have not had enough 
time to resu bmit the article. 

Demands on the scientists' time 
have increased since publishing 
their findings. Pressure o n them 
has also increased since the Utah 
legislature approved funds based 
on confi rmat ion of the fusion 
reaction. There was fear of being 
scooped by other scientific insti-
tutions . If they had proceeded in 
the normal way (by presenting 
tech nical papers and a lecture cir-
cuit), they would have been foot-
notes in the history of cold fu sio n. 

Chemistry professor Johann 
Oesterreicher reported that the 
style of the discovery was "differ-
ent tha n most. The parallel with 
fission is that the discovery of fis-
sIon was revolutionary. The dif-
ference is that we are now in 
peacetime rather than wartime. It 
i~ impossible that science would 
be interpreted and developed si m-
~Iarly. With something of t)1lS 
commerciallmponance, o ne must 
go to the media ." 

Yet, certai n questions remain. 
What a re the implications of a 
peacetime d iscovery of an energy 
source th is powerful? What role 
will the government and private 
ector play? 

ca n take no punitive measure 
against these countries; however, 
they can apply "moral pres u re," 
he said. 

Accord ing to T raci Romine, a 
spokesper on for Gree npeace, the 
United States, in an effort to pun-
ish Japan for its con tinued prac-
tice of whaling despite t he mora-
torium, ha p rohibi ted Japan from 
fi hing in American waters. 

To punish Japan for 
whaling, the U. S. has 
prohibited Japan from 
f ishing in American 
waters. 

Romine explained that Japan 
and Iceland sell a high percentage 
of the whale meat acquired under 
the scientific research provi ion. 

"(These countries] sell the whale 
meat. It is a luxury item in sushi 
bars. Iceland, with a scientific 
permit, killed in three years 298 
Fin and Sei whales, amounting to 
$14,OOO,O<Rrin U. S. dollars ," she 
said. 

Another program which is up 
for reapproval at this year's lW 
convention is the Indian Ocean 
.Sanctuary, where whale have 
been protected si nce 1979. Ac-
cording to Holt, three quarters of 
the countries at the convention 
must vote in favor of the sanctu-
ary if it is to be renewed. _ 

Romine aid that members of 
environmental protection groups 
are concerned that Japan and 
other whaling countries will garner 
enough support at this year's IWC 
convention to overturn the mora -
torium when it comes up for 
review next year . 

In reference to Blue whales, 
Romine said that "from 1930 to 
1970, Blue whales were hunted to 
t he point where o nly 600 were 
left ," as o pposed to the 300,000 to 
400,000 Blue whales that popu-
lated the earth 's oceans before t he 
exploitation began . 

Rom ine said that ince the time 
the moratorium on Blue whales 
was implemented, the po pulation 
of the species has not recovered to 
any great extent. 

Greenpeace's main concern "is 
t hat [the whale] popula tion won't 
increase, and they wi ll die out," 
Romine said. 

Explaining why the morator-
ium should remain intact, Ho lt 
said that "recovery will be very 
slow [for the whales] . It has take n 
many, many decades to detect 
recovery in some species tha t have 
been protected for a ve ry long 
time. 

"With effective protection for 
one or two years [under the I WC 
moratorium], no one can expect 
to see an increase [in popula-
tion] ," Holt aid . According to 
another delegate to t he IWC con-
vention, the whaling na tions must 
have a three quarters majority in 
order to overturn the m oratorium 
next year. 

"It is quite clear," Holt aid, 
"that the whaling countries will 
want the moratorium lifted" at 
next year's convention, which will 
be held in the Hague, Net herlands. 

On June 12 at II a .m., Green-
peace member and o ther who 
wi h to join the rally will meet at 
Sunset Park on We t Mission 
Bay Drive, and will march to the 
Hyatt Islandia, where the IWC 
will be meeting.

Inadequate 
Agency 
Editor: 

I would like to recommend to 
UCSD students, faculty, and staff 
to use an agency other than 
Council Travel, the on-campus 
agency, when booking travel 
arrangements. Their limited set of 
travel packages may not provide 
you with the best available one to 
suit your needs, although they 
may say so. Both times I used 
Council Travel to book my 
arrangements, Council Travel was 
less than helpful. 
-- travel is a competitive indus-
try, and UCSD is obligated to 
provide reasonable service to stu-
dents. If Council Travel cannot 
provide adequate service, then 
another travel agency should be 
allowed to operate on campus. Or 
better yet, a student run travel 
agency should be formed.

Softball 
Continued from page 4 

portrayed. We realize that every 
team has problems, and acknowl-
edge that we are no exception, 

We feel, though, that these 
inner-team conflicts should re-
main amongst members of the 
team for discussion and resolu-
tion. They should not be on dis-
play for the general public, nor 
should they be voiced by a non-
team member. 

As for experience, nothing 
could be more negative for us 
than to have the best softball sea-
son in UCSD history clouded by 
an individual's misguided , vindic-
tive search for revenge. 

As the "team" part of the team, 
we learned that the most impor-
tant experience of all was work-
ing together ... NOT as a clique.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO 

New parking regulations 
on campus 
Permits now required on weekends, too 

By RANDY DOTINGA 
Slaff wriler 

The era of free night and weekend 
parking at UCSD ended July I, when new 
parking regulations took effect. 

Parking permits are now required from 
7 a.m. to II p.m. on weekdays and from 
10 a.m. to J I p.m. on weekends, except on 
University-designated holidays. 

According to Cleo Phillips, special 
events coordinator of the Parking and 
Transportation Department, free night 
and weekend parking , was abolished in 
order to make the parking situation at 
UCSD "more equitable," so daytime 
parkers would not be the only ones bearing 
the brunt of parking fees . 

However, Phillips said the new revenue 
from night and weekend parkers will not 
reduce the costs of parking permits. 

Instead, "It's going to keep them from 
going up any faster." 

Student permits for the 1989-90 school 
year will be S 19.00 per montll or $171.00 
for the school year, Phillips said, emphasiz-
ing that the new regulations will not affect 
owners of A, B, or S permits, which will 
still be valid at all times . 

The new regulations were approved by 
the Parking and Transportation Alter-
native Advisory Committee earlier this 
year, Phillips said . 

The costs of temporary night and 
weekend parking permits are as follows : 
S 1.00 for an evening (5 p.m . to II p.m.) on 
weekdays , 52.00 for a Saturday or Sunday 
if bought between 10 a .m. and 3 p.m., and 
51.00 for a Saturday or Sunday if bought 
between 3 p.m. and II p.m. 

Long-term permits allowing night and 
weekend parking are 5 10.00 for a month, 
S 15.00 for a quarter, and $40.00 for a year 
(July I-June 30). 

A "remote" permit is also available for 
53.00 a quarter, phillips said. It would 
allow night and weekend parking in lot 
355 only, which is one of the northern 
Third College lots . 

The "remote" permit was invented to 
give "another option for those who did 
not want to pay S 1.00 an evening," Phillips 
said , and is "a real good deal." 

However, only UCSD faculty, staff and 
full-time students with picture I Ds are 
eligible to buy "remote" permits, he said . 

......... w ...... vl.ttor. lilli' ... " ...... 
out .,...... lie tlcllllt." 

In addition, two parking attendants are 
being stationed at each of the nine 
entrances to UCSD from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
on weekdays and from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. on 
weekends , he said. 

The attendants sell parking permits, 
explain the new parking regulations, and 
offer directions, Phillips said . 

"They stop everyuone who does not 
have a current UCSD [parking] permit. 
They are giving the visitor an opportunity 
to purchase a permit," he said. 

The attendants are also "helping out as 
far as security- it's cut down on some of 
the flagrant thefts that could have taken 
place," he said. 

The attendants will be stationed at the 
entrances "indefinitely," he added. 

Also enforcement hours on parking 
meters are in the process of being changed, 
Phillips said. Meters will be enforced 
weekdays from 7 a.m. to II p.m., and 
weekends from 10 a .m. to II p.m. 

Meter rates 'Will remain at 50 cents per 
hour, Phillips said , and "we do not ee an 
increase coming." 

Parking permit can be bought at the 
Parking Office (400 MAAC) weekdays 
from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and at the 
Gilman Information Booth Monday thru 
Saturday from 8 a.m . to 9 p.m .. and 
Sunday from 8 a .m. to 5 p.m.

SUMMER EDITION, 1989 

The Chargers: New coach, 
new players, new hope 

By TOMI ARGO BAST 
Contributing wriler 

At this time every year since 1976, blue 
and white jerseys take over the north end 
of the UCSD campus. The San Diego 
Chargers officially opened their J 989 train-
ing camp on July 23, when rookie and 
free agents reported . This year they will 
have full use ofthejust completed Alex G . 
Spanos Training Facility, which houses a 
weight room, locker room, and offices. 
The 1989 ea o n IS one in wh ich the 
Chargers will have to adjust to many 
changes that have occurred since the end 
of '88. 

The biggest of these happened last 
December 10th, when Al Saunders was 
lired. After a 6-10 season marred by bad 
trades (e.g. the Lachey deal) and an end-
less string of injuries, the front office 
attemptrd to solve their problem by 
removing Saunders. Let us remember 
that Saunders took over as head coach in 
the middle of '86, after Don Coryell 
resigned. The next year Sa u nders was 
faced with the NFL Players strike and was 
forced to utilize the Re-Chargers. Then in 
1988 ... well, you get the picture. He 
wasn't really given a fair shot over time. 
An average NFL player's career is 3.2 
years - Saunders hardly got in 2.5. 

On February 9 of this year, the Chargers 
announced the signing of Dan Henning as 
their new head coach. Henning, who 
quarterbacked for the Chargers in the 
'60s, has fourteen years of NFL coaching 
experience including two Super Bowl 
titles as an a sistant with the Redskins 

• ........ __ Ell ........ lIa, •• wi .... 
willi I ................. CUrter. _ lie 
P'lICtiCIi flllIIlI.'1 

and four years as head coach of the 
Atlanta Falcons. He is very excited about 
the upcoming season , but with three new 
assistant coaches and several new players 
acquired through the draft and free 
agency, Henning's not big on early predic-
tion . "The object right now is to get this 
group working cohesively and for the 
coaches and the personnel people to try 
and pick out the best forty-seven ." 

Picking out those forty-seven is even 
more difficult this year since the NFL has 
imposed an 80-man roster rule. Thi for-
ces all 28 teams to have their rosters at 
eighty by June I. One Charger official 
stated that in the past they would have as 
many as 120 players in camp because the 
old rule allowed an unlimited roster until 
the lirst pre-season game. With the new 
rule, teams are limited to the maximum of 
80. 

If they sign a new player, an player on 
the roster of 80 must be waived. ~lt is an 
unfortunate and unusual circumstance," 
Henning says, "but they had to do it all 
the way around the league." Henning 
empathizes with guys that never made it 
to training camp to compete for a spot on 
the roster. "You don't like to do it. You 
like to give a guy a chance, especially after 
he's been with you and worked . But you 
can't do it . We don't have control." 

Henning goes on to explain "the 80-
man roster makes you have to make 
quicker decisions chronologically. Gen-
erally, we always get to 80 somewhere 
during training camp, but it is usually in 
August. We're in the middle of July now 
and they tell you you have to be at eighty,

On Old Glory and the 
politics of change 

The eighties have often been viewed as 
a time of complacency in the U.S., a time 
of national self-satisfaction and little 
self-examination. 

It isn't accurate to say this is changing, 
but we are entering a new era in world 
politics. It may not be a kinder, gentler 
era, but it is one in which some important 
issues,such as the environment, are finally 
being tackled. Unfortunately. however. 
some small issues- such as flag burn-
ing- are being blown out of proportion in 
an attempt to find a safe issue to yell 
about, since the war on drugs is getting 
old . 

Flag burning is a remarkable silly issue. 
All but three senators voted that the 
Supreme Court was wrong in their 5-4 
decision overturning laws against flag 
desecration. But the composition of the 
majority should have set off a few 
alarms- Justice Scalia is hardly liberal, 
and the newest Justice, Kennedy. almost 
always votes with the conservative major-
ity. This was a simple issue : flag burning 
is a form of expression, albeit a vulgar, 
disgusting one. 

Flag burning is hardly a real national 
problem. It isn't commonplace. And, more 
importantly. it obviously invokes a strong 
negative reaction. One of my friends 
joked that Congress should pass a law 
requiring mindless radicals to burn flags, 
so people would know what morons they 
really are. The case that started all this 
was the torching of the American flag by 
Gregory Johnson, a member of the Revo-
lutionary Communist Youth Brigade, in 
Dallas in 1984. A man watching this 
stepped forward after the flag had burned, 
carefully scraped up the ashes. and buried 

them in his yard. 

Johnson won the hearts and minds of 
no one there . The man who took the ashes 
did , however- and far more so than ifhe 
had used violence to stop Johnson. John-
son should have been arrested for burning 
the flag, of course- but only because the 
flag didn't belong to him. Allowing such 
expression endangers no one, and dimin-
ishes only the burner. This nation is 
strong enough to withstand many attacks, 
and, as Justice Brennen pointed out in his 
opinion, it is that very toleration which 
makes us strong. 

The environment, however, is not such 
a simple issue. It is one of remarkable 
complexity. At the recent summit in Paris 
of the seven most important economies in 
the free world, the issue was finally 
tackled . George Bush, like Margaret 
Thatcher before him, has apparently come 
around to a recognition of the importance 
of environmental issues. 

And not a moment too late. The rain 
forests are disappearing, oil spills are 
rampant, and damage to nature is accel-
erating rather than decelerating. Envir-
onmental issues, as the London Econo-
mist points out, will likely be the focus of 
our energies overthe next forty years, just 
as the cold war was over the last forty. It is 
tied in with Latin American debt prob-
lems, issues of national sovereignty, and 
difficult scientific problems. It is long past 
time for the governments of the world to 
work on these problems. 

In this new era, the news has taken on 
almosta surreal quality. A Bloom County 
cartoon a few years ago showed Opus

CHANGE 
Continued from pale 2 

Leaders in 
communist 
countries now 
speak of an 
"evil empire." 

watching the news, and the newscaster 
said something like ~The USSR has admit-
ted com.nunism is a failure." then added 
"Just kidding!" 

But something close to that is bappen-
ing, particularly in the Eastern Bloc coun-
tries. As many commentators have pointed 
out. it is leaders in communist countries 
who now speak of an "evil empire." The 
change is exhilerating, and we should be 
swept up in it, and be excited by it. But we 
should always keep one eye focused on 
Tiannanmen Square. 

Change is always fragile. and a new era 
can be dangerous.

THE JOB MARKET 

College Grad entry job could 
be as . . . secretary? 
so you're going to walk away from college next summer with a liberal 

arts, humanities or social sciences 
degree. Then what? 

Typically, yo u11 ha ve a bare bones 
resume, and your college placement office 
will help yo u line up interviews with the 
biggies- major banks, Pacific Bell, SDG 
& E. Chevron, Hewlett-Packard or Lock-
heed . The hiring process will be slow, and 
you 11 find yourself frustrated as the summer 
goes on. 

You're ti ring of endless interviews con-
ducted by human resources types. 

You've taken more psychological pattern 
tests than even the CIA administers. 

You've put a sheen on your clothes from 
sitting in vi nyl coveted chairs in corporate 
waiting rooms. 

Have you ever thought of applying for a 
secretarial job? 

Of course not, you'l answer. I didn't go 
to college to end up as a secretary. 

Several experts say that's the wrong atti-
tude. since a secreta ry's job in a smaller 
organization can provide the first step on a 
career path with fa tel' footing than a train-
ee's job in a large corporation. 

Accord ing to Walter Macauley. CEO of 
Menlo Park's ADIA Personnel Services, 
~College grads should explore nontradi-
tional opportunities when looking for their 
first job.-

Macauley's firm provides temporary and 
permanent personnel placement services 
from 500 offices in 39 states. Last year they 
filled 20,000 secretarial positions. 

~The growth of our economy is being 
fueled by new jobs at smaller companies, 
not expansions by large corporations," 
Macauley said yesterday. 

Secretaria l and administrative positions 

at these smaller, entrepreneurial companies 
canotfer tremendous opportunity for aggres-
sive, resourceful grads. 

When it comes to money, college grads 
with word processing skills and a good case 
of the smarts can start at about the same 
salary as their peers with bachelor's degrees 
who opt for jobs in communications, law 
enforcement, social work, commercial bank-
ing and technical research. 

The figure, says the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. is about $20,185 a yea r. 

Another authority, Victor Lindquist of 
Northwestern University who wrote the 
Lindquist-Endicott Report on college re-
cruiting, says that starting as a secretary is 
an excellent option. 

~Choose a company that is committed to 
promotion from within,ft Lindquist advises. 
~ A lot of managers fail to capitalize on the 
talent they have available. In that case, it is 
up to the individual to create his or her own 
program."

The "new look" Student Center 
A s you make your way around campus this summer, going from 

class to class, and from class to the 
beach, one of the many construction sites 
that may catch your eye is at the Student 
Center, across from the Main Gym. 

The Student Center was built at UCSD 
19 years ago, and is currently undergoing 
a major renovation. This rem;xieling was 
planned to occur after the Price Center 
was completed, allowing for the expan-
sion of all the services located in the build-
ing. A portion of the renovation is cur-
rently under way, and the first store to 
re-open is the General Store Co-op. Don' 
let ongoing construction stop you from 
visiting-these services are all open for 
business throuahout. 

Other services currently located in the 
building are: The Food Co-op, Ground-
work Books, the Computer Science Co-
op, Soft Reserves and Lecture Notes, the 
Bike Shop, Grove Catfeand 1M GUllfdum. 
The final stages of renovation are expected 
to be completed by the time students 
return in mid-September, at which time a 
Student Credit Union (affiliated with the 
University and State Employees Credit 
Union) should also be open. 

YOUNG 
: .... TT!TUr·ES 

The funding for the expansion of the 
Student Center is corning out ofthe con-
struction budget for the Price Center. 
When students voted a fee increase a few 
years ago, the Price Center construction 
was planned as money was being set aside 
for the Student Center renovation. On 
completion ofthe renovation, UCSD will 
have one of the largest student center 
operations in the country. 

The governing of the space in the Stu-
dent Center and Price Center is done by 
an advisory board known as the Univer-
sity Center Board . The UCBiscomprised 
of students, faculty, and staff who advise 
the Vice Chancellor of Underaraduate 
Affairs on how the student fee and the 
actual buildings are to be used . According 
to Jason Carbone, student chair of the 
UCB, ~I think that the Student Center 
Renovation is greatly needed . By making 
these changes, we are creating an envir-
onment in which student organizations, 
cooperatives, and the campus media can 
flourish. " 

The board is already planning a Grand 
"Re-opening" of the Student Center for 
this Fall, so watch for details.

Do The 1I1,lIt Thin, 
Powerful. Tbere's no other word to 

des ribe it, except disturbing. This one 
hocks, and it makes ya think. 

Do The Right Thing, a "joint" by Spike 
Lee, tells the story ofa race riot in broiling, 
mid-summer Brooklyn. What causes the 
riot is trivial (the immediate cause, any-
way) but the message is not . This film is 
Lee's answer to Howard Beach and Tamara 
Brawley. 

These two incidents arc a reSidue o( the 
taCIt, In muttonal racism creepi ng through 
this country-all over agaIn. The Impetus 
o( resurgingconservatt m that marked the 
Reagan years IS wiping out hard earned 
vIctories such as affirmative action. Did it 
only take twenty years to make up for the 
prevIous hundred? 

Conservatism should not be equated 
With a step back in time. What Spike Lee 
says is that you can't go backwards-and 
still have a happy ending. The fact that so 
compelling a vision should corne from 
Spike Lee is a revelation. He was hereto-
(ore known for the low budget, hilarious 
sexing of She's Gaeta Haw 1r and the black 
in-jokes of the musical School Date. 
For Lee to have produced Righr Thing is 
roughly akin to Fred De Cordova having 
lensed Dr. SlrangeiotJe as a followup to his 
" Bonzo" pictures . 

The final (rame lingers long after. It's a 
qUOte from Malcolm X: "Violence used in 
self defense is intelligence." 

You won't-better still, can't-leave 
this movie without feeling something. 
Outrage, uneasiness-it all depends on 
which end of the stick you're stuck with.

pessemistic). The script is excellent, the 
acting right on. When Harry Met Sallyisan

SUMMER ENTERTAIN MENT SECTION 

lICI.II To lUll 
Women, a lmle humor. and a lor of 

aClion-that's lhe way they all are." 
With those words, my little brother 

neatly summed up the substance and 
appeal of th" James Bond movie series, 
including the most recent installment, 
/.Jeense To Kill. 

Unfortunately, License has too little 
humor and too much Timothy Dalton . In 
an otherwise excellent production, Dalton 
again fails to live up to the legacy of his 
predecessors. He has neither the cool 
toughness of Sean Connery nor the smil-
ing suaveness of Roger Moore. 

In this go-around, Bond's seeks revenge 
on a Latin-American drug thug, who 
killed the bride of his friend. a CIA agent. 
On the way he conquers two women 
(Talisa Soto and Carey Lowell), both 
appealing yet with the combined IQ of a 
home appliance. No feminists sat in on 
this script conference. 

At lea t Bond is no longer monogamous 
as he was In Dalton's last Bond outing, The 
Living DaylighlS. A one-woman, safe-sex 
Bond is like taking your mother to a 
Metallica concert-it ca n be done, but It 
Just doesn't make much sense. 

The chase scenes, especially the gasoline 
truck sequence, are among the best In the 
Bond series-and are the best reason to 
see thiS vehicle. Inexplicably, little of the 
picturesque Carribean location appears In 
the final product. [thought exotic scenery 
was what made the globe-hopping Bond 
films so great. 

What're ya doin' this summer? Slaving on some 
internship? Flipping burgers? Summer school? Surfin '? 

Because of Dalton 's stiffness and lack of 
personality, his Bond is less appealing. I 
give this film a B- (shaken, not stirred.) 

R.D. 
Or just, simply and unabashedly, nothing? The 
Guardian summer staff cor.stantly scrutinizing both 
the hyped and the obscure, has been at work . W e've 
saved you the trouble of going through the old "I 
dunno, what do you wanna do" routine you do with 
your honey every week. W e've perused a few flicks, 
discs, places to eat and other upcoming events that 
you may want to check out before the summer ends 
and clases resume. So go have a little fun. 

Contributing to this section were Randy Dotinga, uesa Light, Mike Martinez, 
and John Shaw. 

Bltman 
No movie since Star Wars has been . 

given the advertising and commercial blitz 
of Barman. More like the original comic 
book figure than later pop versions, this 
Batman has a dark, evil side to him . The 
mysterious ways of this enigmatic cru-
sader will surprise more than a few movie-
goers. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson 
are both excellent, although you may 
sense that Keaton is a bit uncomfortab le is 
both his suit and this dark drama. The 
special effects and animation are first rate, 
but this film is more for the adults than the 
kid dies.

Dlld Poe", Society 
Advertisements declare it to be fearuring 

Robin Williams, yet Dead Poet's Society is a 
film that encompasses more than the 
talents of Williams. It depicts life in a 
boy's school in the '50's with an outlan-
dish English teacher. The narrative starts 
slowly but the beautiful scenery and cine-
matography keep your attention. This is 
well worth whatever you pay to see it, but 
don't expect the outrageous Robin of 
Good Morning Vietnam. He plays a much 
more real human being here. The rest o( 
the cast was also excellen t in a moving 
story. Definitely one of the summer's tOP 
five .

Don Hlnle, 
Thl E.d ot the Innocenci 

Don Henley 's third solo album since the 
break-up of the Eagles reflects the talent 
and sources that Henley has in the busi-
ness . The feel on these tracks is unlike 
anything from his last two LP's The &ys of 
Summer and Building the Perfect Beast. They 
do have the distinctive Eagles/ Don Hen-
ley sound-that is, his characteristic high 
pitched, melodious rasp of a voice. Greed 
as a theme is another Henley trademark. In 
"Little Tin God" he blows down the 
Swaggarts and theit fonts of religious 
commercialism. 

Perfect Beast spoke to the heart of Mid-
dle America, and The End of the Innocence

Henley's ballads tell a cohesive story, 
each with an imagi native use of rhythm 
that reflects his d rumming background. 
His collaborations here don't always clic:k, 
however, The title cut seems like a Bruce 
Hornsby song outright, even mid-way 
through the first vocal. Other than its tide 
and theme, it doesn't fit on • Don Henley 
album. Axl Rose's joins in on "I Will Not 
Go Quietly" and reveals his mastery of 
the subject of harmony. It is the most 
intriguing track on the album. Edie Brick-
ell and Melissa Ethridge lend backing 
vocals elsewhere , 

On The Heart of the MatleT, Henley 
bares his soul to the point that you feel 
you're intruding on some very private 
space. His collaborators here were the 
super-introspective) ,D. Souther and Mike 
Campbell. 

The richness of his solo work has 
shown that Don Henley can stand on his 
own, It has much overshadowed the rather 
formulaic offerings of the other main 
Eagle, Glenn Frey, He earned his way to 
an end of innocence long berfore this

These lyr ics from Petry's first solo 

album (sans Heartbreakers) aptly sum up 
his career . His star always seems to shine 
even on an all-star team like the Traveling 
W ilburys. 

This album of mostly Petty origina ls 

was recorded in a garage (it was originally 
titled "Songs from the Garage") and Pet-
ty's famous friends join in. George Harri-
son strums :'Ind sings on the single "I 
Won't Back Down", which reflects the 
serious-message Petry . The late Roy

show's Petty's grea t sense of musical

Never let it be said that Cher is one 
dimensional. Classic rock icon, TV star, 
Vegas act, award winning actress, MTV 
staple, exercise maven, bagel groupie-she 
has kept busy. One of the talents shown 
on her album Heart of Stone is her innate 
ability to select songs that showcase the 
unique quality of her voice . 

The LP itself has great production and is 
enjoyable listening, yet it has a repetitive 
nature , Every song is about love, mostly 
lovers that have been forsaken and are 
now weeping alone. This ever-repeating 
theme is reflected in titles like "If I Could 
Turn Bade Time," "Still in Love with 
You," and "Does Anybody Really Fall in 
Love Anymore?" Her duet with Pete

popular standard, 

I would like to see Cher write her own

a.tRla loundtrlcll 

I recall reading about a controversy over 
the release of Prince's Batman 
soundtrack in conjunction with the film's 
release in June . It seems that the actual 
score was done by Danny Elfman of Oingo 
Boingo, and his album won't be out until 
until Aueust. Prince only had two songs 
acruually heard in Barman, and one was 
during the closing credits as evevybody 
scrambled to the exits, 

Well, having finally seen the film, I say 
big deal. The lO odd-minutes of the P-
Man that I did hear were the best things in 
the whole flick , Once the spectacle and 
oddness of this film sank in, you were 
rendered in such a state of awe that you 
could scarcely sit back and just enjoy it, As 
for Elfman's music, it had almost no effect 
at all for me. 

That's why Prince 's "soundtrack" is 
such aJoy. Whereas Elfman's rather somber 
string sections were more in tune with the 
whole "dark knight" fantasy that comic 
buffs are into, Prince's splashy version of 
funk seems based on his childhood rem-
iniscence of the TV Batman. Could he 
have been thinking of )ulie Newmar when 
he wrote Scan~lous! This latest in his 
repertoire oL~duction ballads mines the 
same smolJering coyness as Slow Looe, 
Adore, and Anastcsia(from Sign 0 the Times 
and LoveseX)' respectivel,). 

Trust , which sets a scene in the film 
where the Joker destroys some works of 
art, is rather disturbing in its context, So 
slap it on the turntable in the privacy of 
your home, where you can wear just a robe 
and cigar if you like. It's great dance music, 
even if you're alone . 

Batdance may be o ne of P's nuttiest 
moments on record , The song nearly 
explodes with every theme and musical 
trademark in his bag of tricks. Even Pia, in 
the Sunshine plods next to this , The sound 
bites from the film, with various excerpts 
from the Joker and Batman dialogue, lends 
an eerie, surreal quality not usually found 
in MTV-influenced rock as film promo-
tion. It starts with some vintage Dooes Cry 
psychedelic guitar, and catch the "Batman" 
chorus that recurs, Sound familiar? 

A middle passage · consists entirely of 
the name "Vicki Vale" and some chunka-
chunka guitar riffs that are more danceable 
than whole albums by other stars. Finally, 
a reprise at the end that is so kinetic and 
fun that you wish it went on forever . 

If you see the movie first, take one of 
these rwice a day until you recover.

There's something to be said for a res-

some marketing manager's vision: South-

uphill from the beach.The pink brick 
building is simple, with glass block win-
dows. It even looks fun-it's part diner, 
part outdoor cafe. On any weekend morn-
ing you'll find the dozen-odd tables teem-
ing with aggressive brunchers. If the brunch 
is truly the art form of Southern Califor-
nia , Kirby's Cafe is one of it's hottest 
exhibits. 

Kirby's has been under new ownership 
since June, and on any given day the owner 
himself will probably seat you. Dapper, 
sockless Paul Frankel is one of the new 
breed of restaurateur. He's a businessman 
making a good investment-but he also 
knows wines and where and how to recruit 
good chefs. 

On a recent Saturday, my party of four 
stopped in for dinner. The new dinner 
menu has become a weekly event there. 
The chef, known only as John, worked 
behind the scenes. His mushroom appetiz-
ers in garlic sauce and spinach salad with 
honey mustard dressing were tasty warm-
ups . I sampled all four entrees; each one 
had a distinctive and imaginative touch. 
The fresh mahi, grilled in a tomato butter 
sauce, was tender, nearly dissolving. In 
contrast, the Calimari Leon (that'S squid) 
had snap and texture. The Fettucini Prov-
encal bathed in a rich tomato and meat 
sauce, and the Chicken Veracruz was 
topped by fresh chili that was better than ) 
what I've had in so-called authentic Mexi-
can restaurants. 

The college crowd of UCSD can go 
either way with Kirby's Cafe, located just 
up the coast. It 's a beach area joint with an 
open patio for brunching; it's also a 
(slightly pricey!) classy dinner spot for 
reali, hot dates, with elegant dishes pre-
pared by a knowing chef. 

You should really try something that 's 3 
full beat offstride from the California 
kiuhcTI1ciJters. M.M.

Chuck Faucette and guard-tackle Gary 
Kowalsk I 

Un igned veterans as of July 27 include 
runnIng bacl~ Gary Ander on. Lionel 
"Llttle Train" James and Napoleon Mc-
Callum (acquired from the Radiers in the 
Lachey dea\) , and linebacker Gary 
Plummer. Charger officials weren't con-
ce rned at that time. but they may be by the 
time you read this . 

They definitely are concerned with two 
colorful but unsigned draft picks. Hold-
ing out are first-rounder Burt Grossman. 
the defensive end from Pittsburgh, and 
second· round quarterback Billy Joe Tol-
liver from Texas Tech. All other rookies 
are signed and accounted for. 

Grossman was quite impressive in Spring 
mini-camp. Because of a recent change in 
agents , negotiations· with him have been 
difficult. Tolliver could be the answer to 
the offensive turmoil that the team expe-
rienced last year with the Laufenberg-
Malone duo, but it's not likely if Billy Joe 
misses the critical drills of training camp. 
By the end of July Steve Ortmayer, Direc-
tor of Football Operations, announced 
that negotiations with Tolliver and his 
agent were deadlocked. 

One rookie who has been decidely pres-
ent is second-round pick Courtney Hall 
from Rice. Henning says the center is Wthe 
number one rookie that is here right now 
to look for. We think he's an outstanding 
player. He'l be someone everyone will 
want to watch."' 

CHARGERS 

Despite the holdouts, Henning's main 
priority is to get the team ready to play. 
"That means installing the types of things 
that we are doing on offense atJd defense . 
Get the team in condition and try to make 
the best player selections we can for down 
the road, so we can get ready for Sept. 
IO- for the first game," Henning says. 

Continued from pale 1 
so we've had to make some early decisions. " 
As a result of the new rule, the Chargers 
had to release five players by the first day . 
Among those released were linebacker 

After early practices and conditioning 
sessions, the trainer has treated only a few 
pulled muscles, and the players present 
are in good condition. Nothing more can 
be said until veterans coming off injuries

have healed and can contribute. Key 
Chargers such as tight end Rod Bernstine 
are on the Physically Unable to Perform 
list and may not return to daily crim-
mages for some time. From the looks of 
things, the Charger can only hope to 
break even thi fall and establish a good, 
trong foundation in order to build a 

quality Super Bowl team of the future . ... , .... , .... ,., 

Chargers: Super Bowl bound? 
It's too soon to tell about the Chargers. Wouldn 't it be fun it they signed Grossman 

and Toll iver, got hot early, and scored a couple of upsets. Soon, the whole football 
following country, especially them gambling folks in Oregon, will be talking. Seems 
another lowly regarded team did that some three years ago, The Atlanta Falcons-
coached by one Dan Henning. 

Whoa . .. what? Damn! Overslept again. Now what was I supposed to do today? Oh 
yeah-make some NFL predictions. Every fall I crank out some manner of pigskin 
article in the GUARDIAN, but by the time I come out with my "Elway will rule" or "The 
Bears stink" lead, I've been proven wrong. This yeAr, I've got the lead time to really 
look foolish. 

IFC EAST - Well, it's too damn hot in Phoenix, I'm still not sold on the Eagles, and I've 
never liked Dallas. The Giants are fading. Til, Red.llln. here. Even with injuries to 
Doug Williams, this kid Rypien can do what Jay Schroeder did in '86. 
IFC CEITRAL - Til, '1IlIng •. It's a simple race here. Those pesky Bears are there 
every year, and they may score a wild card berth in a down year, But they haven't 
recovered from last year's championship game. 
IFC WEST - 48,r •. Look for them to get upset early in the playoffs, however. The 
Rams will get their usual wild card, and the Saints, who may not have the brilliant Jim 
Finks running the show, should falter. The Falcons are still in the division. 
AFC EAST - Til, Dolpilin • . I refuse to beheve Shula can go this long without winning 
again .. . of course, that's what I though about Landry. Buffalo, wild card. The rest-
who cares? 

AFC CENTRAL - Now here's a division that can play some football. The Oliers, 
Browns, and Bengals may be the top three teams in the AFC. Even the Steelers are 
brutal. The winner (I should say survivor-I,ngela.) 
AFC WEST - Chargers, right? Wrong. Unfortunately, nothing short of the miraculous 
conicidence of Tolliver and Grossman, Courtney Hall and Dan Henning suddenly 
becoming Hall of Fame caliber at the same time. This division goes to the Reld,r •.
