ACADEMICS

New Drop 
Policy in 
Cases of 
Cheating

BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Writer

A proposed change to the aca-
demic misconduct code would allow 
students accused of cheating to drop 
a class — and receive a ‘W’ — with-
out being forced by a professor to 
re-enroll. 

Originally, students who dropped 
a course after being accused of 
academic misconduct could be 
re-enrolled by the professor, who 
could then issue ‘F’ grades before 
the charges were proven, Committee 
on Educational Policy Chair Bill 
Griswold said. 

“The purpose of that is to per-
mit the administration to hold the 
student accountable for their per-
formance in the course,” Griswold 
said. “The problem with this is that 
the student may have dropped the 
course for reasons unrelated to the 
academic misconduct.” 

According to Griswold, students 
who dropped a class during Week 
3 could be re-enrolled if the profes-
sor discovered a problem (based on 
the student’s original performance) 
a few weeks later in the quarter, at 
which point the student would be 
unable to pass.

“[Under the old policy], if you 
had cheated in a class or been 
accused of it, if you tried to drop 
once charges were filed, you would 
be automatically re-enrolled,” 
Committee on Educational Policy 
undergraduate representative Mac 
Zilber said.

Under the proposed policy, stu-
dents cannot receive a grade until 
they have been found guilty of aca-
demic misconduct. 

“If a student doesn’t want to deal 
with academic consequences, they 
can drop the class and the professor 
wouldn’t be able to give them an ‘F’,” 
Zilber said. 

However, students can still 
receive administrative consequences 
that can be detrimental to their 
careers, Griswold said.

“Medical schools and law schools 
frequently request [dean] certifica-
tion [to ensure] there was no mis-
conduct on the student’s record,” 
Griswold said. “The conduct code 
includes both academic and nonaca-

A CLOSER LOOK    STUDENT PRIVACY     

By angela chen • Editor in Chief

Ihave, saved on my desktop, a beautifully organized spreadsheet with the personal information of over 25,000 UCSD students. 
The spreadsheet — which covers all undergraduates and graduates enrolled 

as of Winter Quarter 2012 —  includes names, emails, phone numbers and 
addresses, and could have covered more if I had so requested. The only people 
not included are those who have specifically restricted their information; 
according to University Registrar Bill Haid, less than 10 percent of students 
have done so, meaning that my document provides access to 90 percent of our 
campus population. 

There’s a short answer to the question of how I got the spreadsheet: I paid 
for the information in a completely legal transaction, one that any UCSD stu-
dent can go through. After that, it’s just a question of uploading the spreadsheet 
to the appropriate mail server and clicking “send.” But the transaction itself 
is part of a larger discussion about student privacy rights, access and online 
communication. 

For me, the process of obtaining the spreadsheet started with the all-
campus email Utsav Gupta —  former A.S. President and current Alumni 
Office employee — sent on Feb. 29 encouraging students to vote in favor of 
the Division I referendum. Since there was no anti-Division I email, members 
of the con campaign accused the administration of bias, assuming that they 
approved Gupta’s email. As I started interviewing, I heard allegations from pro-
fessors suggesting that Gupta had improperly accessed an all-campus listserv 
without the approval of the appropriate vice chancellor. But when I spoke to 
Gupta, he maintained that he had sent the email without accessing any listserv 
or using university resources. 

I set out to learn more about student privacy rights and how this was pos-
sible. As evidenced by the process I went through in late March and the email 
I sent out to a random sampling of  thousands last night, it is entirely possible

Study Shows People Who Regularly Eat Chocolate Weigh Less
BY AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

Eating chocolate regularly is 
linked to lower weight, a UCSD 
study has found. 

Beatrice Golomb, an associate 
professor at the UCSD School of 
Medicine, presented the counterin-
tuitive finding that more frequent 
chocolate consumption is linked to 
lower body mass index (BMI) in 
her most recent paper, published 
Mar 26 in the Archives of Internal 
Medicine. 

Predictably, such tantalizing 
results have attracted significant 
media attention over the last two 
weeks.

UCSD researchers interviewed 
1,017 otherwise healthy men and 
women for the study. 

They gathered data on diet, life-
style and physical activity. The team 
found that chocolate consumers’ 
average BMI was 1 kg/m2 less than 
that of that of those who do not eat 
chocolate. 

The finding is statistically signif-
icant: A difference of 1 kg/m2 is too 

large to reasonably have occurred 
due to chance. The data indicates 
that even though chocoalte eaters 
consume more calories and satu-
rated fat, they weigh less. 

“Chocolate is my favorite veg-
etable,” Dr. Golomb said. “And that’s 
not completely a joke. It’s a plant-
derived product that’s rich in anti-
oxidants and phytonutrients. And 
in moderation, it can even help you 
lose weight.”

The study did not take into 
account the amount, brand or type 
of chocolate. Only data on con-
sumption frequency was used for 
the study. 

“The findings don’t appear to 
represent a proxy for more healthful 
behavior overall,” Dr. Golomb said. 
That is, it is the consumption of 
chocolate itself, rather than healthy 
lifestyle choices that might be asso-
ciated with chocolate, that seems to 
be behind the lower BMIs of regular 
chocolate consumers.

This fact offers support for Dr. 
Golomb’s current hypothesis that 
chemicals in chocolate can stimu-
late metabolism.

But because the data published 
last month were gathered from a 
cross-sectional study rather than an 
experiment, Dr. Golomb said that 
no causal effect can be established 
yet. 

Without doubt, though, regu-
lar chocolate consumers have lower 
BMIs on average, despite higher 
overall caloric intake.

Dr. Golomb said the study’s 
outcome is good news for 
chocolate fans like herself.  
She came up with the idea for the 
experiment at a medical conference. 

The conference served generally 
healthy food for dinner. Dr. Golomb 
and a colleague were surprised by 
the arrival of a dessert cart contain-
ing slices of chocolate cake.

The juxtaposition of healthy 
and unhealthy caused Dr. Golomb 
to think about the health benefits 
of chocolate that had already been 
established. 

Chocolate, she knew, is known 
to lower blood pressure, increase 
sensitivity to insulin and improve 
blood lipid profile. Stearic acid — 
the predominant fatty acid in cocoa 

butter — is the only saturated fat 
known to lower one’s LDL (bad cho-
lesterol) levels. 

After seeing the chocolate cake 
served right after the healthy din-
ner, she began to wonder whether 
chocolate couldn’t help individuals 
manage their weight as well and 
then decided to conduct this study.

demic infractions. If you’re caught 
stealing or vandalizing, it all goes on 
your record.” 

Griswold said that “administra-
tive consequences” can range from 
educating people on academic 
integrity to dismissal. First-time 
offenses can result in suspension 
for a quarter, which can delay a 
student’s graduation, Griswold said. 

If the student drops the class 
before charges are filed, she cannot 
be given an ‘F.’ (though the student 
can still receive an ‘F’ if she drops 
the class after the charges are filed). 

According to Griswold, if a stu-
dent is found guilty of academic 
misconduct, his or her grade is sub-
ject to the professor’s guidelines.

“Usually [academic consequenc-
es] aren’t very severe,” Griswold 
said. “If you fail the class, you can 

retake it and it doesn’t count on 
your GPA.”

Under the proposal, there are 
two ways a professor can file charges 
if he thinks a student has cheated. 
Professors can meet with the stu-
dent before submitting a formal 
charge to the Office of the Academic 
Integrity Coordinator. They can also 
submit formal charges directly to 
the Academic Integrity Committee. 
Griswold said that the committee 
advises faculty members to file a 
complaint with the administration 
before meeting with the student. 

According to Zilber, the new 
policy developed after a two-year 
process during which the Academic 
Senate gathered input from other 
campus committees. 

The Committee on Educational 
Policy weighed in on the issue 
during its 2011 session, debat-
ing whether professors should 

give students a ‘W’ as academic 
punishment if they plan on drop-
ping instead of an ‘F,’ Zilber said.  
The CEP proposed the change to 
this academic misconduct policy 
after questioning the policy’s consis-
tency with other existing academic 
integrity guidelines.

CEP passed the proposal at 
its Feb. 13 meeting. According to 
Griswold, the proposal must go 
through the university Rules and 
Jurisdictions Committee and be 
voted on by the Academic Senate 
Representative Assembly before 
the current policy can be officially 
changed.   

According to Senior Senate 
Analyst for UCSD Academic Senate 
Miky Ramirez, the CEP last met on 
March 19.

This week, A.S. Council looked to the future as it discussed reforms that will be 
implemented in the 2012-13 school 
year.

Associate Vice President of 
College Affairs 
Leonard Bobbitt 
announced a 
competition 
between the 
colleges to tally 
the most voters 
in the A.S. 
elections, which 
are going on right now.

“This time pizza is not the object 
of our desire, it is cake,” he said.

Marshall Senator Bryan Cassella 
reported that About the Music, a 
foundation that provides grants to 
teachers in 42 districts in the San 
Diego area, will be sponsoring by Sun 
God for a Cause.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Brian McEuen explained 
that the council is running a Student 
Fee Survey to gauge student interest 
in Student Fee-funded programs. 
He also told the council about 
Triton Outfitter’s popularity with 
new families on Triton day, and the 
inclusion of Triton Outfitters for Tots 
in the Sun God merchandise.

Revelle Senator Meena Kaushik 
announced that the first renovation 
meeting for Plaza Café will be held 
next week. 

“One of your favorite dining halls, 
Plaza, is going under renovation,” she 
said. It’s definitely among the top six 
in terms of dining halls.

The council sang a rousing “happy 
birthday” song to Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy Bryce 
Farrington.

Farrington and former Associate 
Vice President of Student Advocacy 
Arohi Sharma proceeded to present 

council with the revisions being made 
to the Student Conduct Code. 

Sharma noted that the rewritten 
code is a step in the right direction, 
but voiced her concern with the 
lack of administrative accountability 

and the remaining 
vagueness in 
process, procedures 
and regulations.

“I can’t 
emphasize that point 
enough,” she said.

Farrington 
explained the 

mechanics of the Community 
Standards Board, which will replace 
the Campuswide Judicial Board 
in dealing with cases of possible 
suspension, dismissal, jurisdiction 
appeals and cases that involve multiple 
students from different college 
councils. 

Farrington stressed the inclusion 
of the line “other disruptive activity 
incompatible with the orderly 
operation of the campus,”

“This can seriously affect 
everyone—this could literally be 
anything,” he said.

Bobbitt, who was also named 
Councilmember of the Week, 
presented his plan for the future of 
the freshman council, including an 
expansion of the council without a 
limitation on membership. 

During the debate, Campuswide 
Senator Matthew Bradbury noted 
the lack of criteria available to judge 
applicants to the freshman council. 

After much debate, the council 
voted to expand the freshman 
council, passing the measure 22-1.  

Council passed a more 
lighthearted measure sponsored 
by A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
declaring the superiority of the 
ASUCSD LipDub over the ASUCI 
Lip Dub.

our campus population. And Gupta 
and I aren’t the only ones who can 
do so.

The names, emails, numbers and 
addresses I have fall under the cat-
egory of public directory informa-
tion, and were previously available 
through the online student directory 
on TritonLink. Before September 
2011 — when administration shut 
down the directory due to student 
privacy concerns — anyone could 
search for students and pull up any 
information not explicitly restrict-
ed. From September on, those who 
wanted the information would either 
need to ask the Registrar informally 

or go through the same process I did, 
which Registrar staff say has been in 
place for at least 19 years. 

According to David Loy of the 
American Civil Liberties Union, 
the Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 stipu-
lates that this official directory infor-
mation can be released without con-
sent — again, unless a student has 
explicitly restricted this information. 
(See our front-page infographic for 
information on how to do so.)

Directory information includes, 
in addition to the data mentioned 
above, most recent educational 
institution attended, major, units 
enrolled, dates of attendance, grade 
level, enrollment status, degrees and 
honors. 

Transcripts, personal identifica-
tion numbers, high school test scores 
and photos are deemed confidential 
and cannot be released without a 

student’s consent once she turns 18 
or attends university. Though this 
confidential information is available 
to all faculty due to “legitimate educa-
tional interest” — for instance, faculty 
would need access to full transcripts 
to write a recommendation letter — 
it cannot be released to third parties 
without explicit consent. 

***

I first tried to obtain the informa-
tion via the California Public Records 
Act, which generally mandates 
release of public information that 
should have included directory data. 
I sent an email requesting the names, 
emails, numbers and addresses of all 
graduates and undergraduates, but 
was denied access.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, APRIL 12,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Short on Proof

The University of California is giving its students an unbalanced liberal 
education, according to a study by 
the conservative group California 
Association of Scholars. The 
April 1 report, titled “A Crisis 
of Competence: The Corrupting 
Influence of Political Activism in 
the University of California” alleges 
that UC humanities departments 
are focusing core curriculum on 
the study of minority grievances 
rather than the study of classics — in 
line with a leftist bias. The group 
claims that this liberal tilt in college 
education compromises the quality 
of education by giving students a 
limited worldview and hurting their 
reading, writing and reasoning skills.

The problems with the study 
are several-fold. First, the study 
fails to acknowledge that while the 
Democrat-to-Republican faculty 
ratio seems skewed, this does 
not immediately correlate with 
professors teaching leftist ideologies. 
True objectivity is extremely 
difficult, if not impossible to achieve 
while teaching a class but as long as 
professors don’t aggressively push 
their ideologies in class, it is not that 
bad. After all, it is possible to be 
biased but balanced. Furthermore, 
the report’s link between lower 
quality education and left-leaning 
professors is ill-supported. The 
report relies on anecdotes, weak 
statistics and inflammatory, 
ideological rants.

The statistics declaring that the 
UC system is heavily populated with 
liberal educators are endless, and 
though the information may be true, 
the system is not based on any sort 
of biased hiring practice. The study 
drones on and on with statistics 
citing that in 1969, 45 percent of 

university faculty nationwide held 
liberal views, and that this number 
has 38 years later skyrocketed to 
“extreme” levels with an 8:1 ratio 
of Democrats to Republicans. But 
researchers have found qualitative 
explanations for this discrepancy 
in professor ideologies. According 

to a study by Harvard sociology 
professor Ethan Fosse and University 
of British Columbia sociology 
professor Neil Gross, most professors 
tend to lean to the left because they 
share advanced degrees, a non-
conservative religious theology, a 
tolerance for controversial ideas 
and a disparity between salary and 
schooling.

While UC faculty may be 
composed of more liberals than 
conservatives, California Association 
of Scholars fails to correctly link 

liberal educators to pushing their 
political agendas on students. One 
such example the report uses is 
that one in five professors in the 
social sciences is a self-declared 
“Marxist” — a dramatic proportion 
that leads the authors to believe 
there is an illegal political test 
in hiring that favors anyone to 
the left. Yet, never once does the 
report connect educator beliefs 
to a greater output of Marxist 
students. A before and after study 
of students’ political views to show 
any type of indoctrination of these 
ideas is absent. The report says that 
the public is “alarmed about the 
professoriate’s radical leftism,” but 
has no substantial evidence as to 
why these fears are founded. 

The authors grasp for evidence 
with their use of student anecdotes. 
One such example was a professor 
who asked the multiple choice 
question, “What system is based 
on the division and exploitation 
of classes?” and only gave credit 
to those students who answered 
“capitalism.” This is an example of a 
complete breach of a professor’s duty 
to her students. But this anecdotal 
evidence presents a problem that 
must be dealt on an individual 
basis by investigating and even 
eliminating biased professors based 
on student reports, and is not as a 
cry for a UC system-wide crisis. 

The California Association 
of Scholars makes some rather 
radical statements about a college 
graduate’s ability to write, read or 
even reason. One specific portion 
of the study cites “widespread” 
employer discontent with their 
new hires’ inability to draft simple 
memos. But their link between a lack 
of critical thinking in classes and

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at

© 2011. Views expressed herein represent the 
majority vote of the editorial board and are not 

necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents, the 
ASUCSD or the members of the Guardian staff. 

I      have been on the A.S. Council longer than most people would advise to stay sane and have, 
along with a few others, won and 
lost elections at all levels of the 
organization. The time I’ve spent 
on council has allowed me to offer 
insight into the elections process, 
going on right now. The processes 
in which slates are created usually 
runs something like this: Someone 
who is interested in running for A.S. 
President looks for others who want 
to run for executive positions. This 
group can either run under a slate 

that existed in prior elections or 
create a new one. They then look for 
other members to join the slate — the 
process for interested candidates to 
join a slate is more about who you 
know than what you know. There may 
be someone who is very involved in 
the campus community but, because 
few people in A.S. Council know 
about the existence of this person, 
they will not be included in any major 
slate. 

Campuswide senator candidates 
benefit tremendously from being on 
a slate, as proved in the past election 
cycle with the Board the Wing slate 
sweeping nearly all of the positions. 
This year the three main slates are 
BOLD, TIDE and Student Voice. 

TIDE is  the slate most similar 
to Board the Wing in composition 
and philosophy,  though it is more 
willing to take up external issues. 

BOLD is a slate that was created 
shortly before the filing period 
elapsed. In fact, there was an exodus 
of several members from TIDE 
leaving to be a part of the newly 
created BOLD slate. These reasons 
can be mainly attributed to internal 
tensions, with some members 
feeling more comfortable with the 
BOLD exec candidates. BOLD can 
be described as similar to Tritons 
First, with some veteran members 
of the first incarnation of the slate 
two years ago returning for another 
round of elections. Tritons First 
traditionally has been the slate 
supported by the Greek community 
and focused on issues centered 
towards student life, and BOLD 
continues this tradition. 

Student Voice is basically 
Students First with a different name 
and different slate color. This slate is 
the one that is most affiliated with 
protests and members of the slate 
are unapologetic activists. Some 
longtime members of the council 
have argued that their politics are 
too divisive and their methods create 
considerable tension. This Student 
Voice has little in common with 
the Student Voice of the 2009-10 
elections, a slate that consisted of 
both Student Affirmative Action 
coalition candidates and members 
from the Greek community.

This year the executive 
candidates lack experience in terms 
of years in council, so the best advice 
I can offer to those voting is to 
vote for individuals based on their 
qualifications, not entire slates. See 
you on the fourth floor.

Accusation of  Decline in Education Not Based in Facts

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor, 
In our three years on A.S. Council, 

we’ve learned three important 
truisms about effectiveness on A.S. 
One is that there’s a steep learning 
curve — it is near impossible to be 
a highly effective council member 
without spending a year muddling 
around first. The second is that some 
degree of ego, or proclivity toward 
self-promotion, is generally necessary 
to be viewed as effective among your 
council peers. And the third is that 
successful people on A.S. don’t easily 
give up power — anybody who can 
get elected will run. 

We write because we believe there 
was one important omission from last 
week’s article, “The A.S. Honor Roll”  
— AVP Student Advocacy Bryce 
Farrington, who is the exception 
to all of these truisms. Bryce first 
started being noticed as the masterful 
manager of Alyssa’s slate last year. 
Board the Wing ultimately won 
27 out of the 30 elections it ran in, 
leading to a year of peace, harmony 
and efficiency on council. Farrington 
could have had any appointed position 
he wanted, but instead he planned on 
serving in an informal role until he 
was asked to serve as AVP Student 
Advocacy, when he was told he was 
only person who could do it. 

The Advocacy Office has a 
high learning curve and workload 
— it generally promotes from the 
inside, choosing AVPs with years 
of experience to weather the highly 
technical work of managing a staff of 
quasi-lawyers. 

Bryce had never been an advocate 
before, and was immediately thrust 
into the middle of Conduct Code 
negotiations. We haven’t seen a single 
person come into council over the 
past three years that would have 

adapted so quickly and successfully 
to such a demanding position in his 
or her first year on council, but Bryce 
managed to make it work, and wrung 
concession after concession out of the 
administration on what was thought 
to be a completed conduct code. 

Indeed, he is perhaps the single 
most reliable and dependable council 
member we have had the pleasure of 
working with, out of all of the great 
choices out there. Bryce had a hand 
in virtually every major initiative this 
year, always behind the scenes. 

He felt no need to self-promote, 
no need to take credit, as he quietly 
advised virtually everybody on 
council at one point or another. 
Bryce never asked for praise and 
never sought attention, he simply 
did whatever was for the good of the 
school, and managed to often be the 
most influential member of council 
without saying a word.

In lieu of endorsing any 
candidates, we say to every reader 
and every candidate for A.S. office: 
Draft Bryce again! His humility is only 
outweighed by his sense of duty, and 
if he is constantly nagged by people 
that the school needs him, then 
maybe he’ll spend one more year in an 
appointed position. The school would 
be lucky to have him.

—Mac Zilber
Former A.S. AVP of Academic 

Affairs

SOLVE FOR X By Philip Jia

political ideologies is simply backed by 
a rant with no facts cited — not even a 
random anecdote. Instead, the section has 
statements such as “if students were asked 
to evaluate different political stances, 
they would have to think, but when they 
are only pressed to adopt one, they are 
being told to stop thinking.” The section 
continues with more broad statements 
with no credible facts to back it up. There 
are dozens of other examples of the 
study’s weak link between educational 
politicization and a supposed decline 
in the education of college students and graduates, 
all either weakly cited by irrelevant studies or sparse 

anecdotes. 
For the writers of the study, their main 

solution to remedy this ideological shift is to 
urge the UC Regents to reinstate balance to 
the faculty and promote a broader teaching 
view. This will be done through intrusive 
campus reports about whether the campus 
heading back to intellectual health — a 
failure to do so, the study suggests, would 
result in the replacement of an academic 
administration. But before the Regents 
decide to follow the advice laid out by the 
study, they should first question the validity 
of the study’s claims, while using critical 

thinking skills and logical reasoning that the study 
most clearly lacks.

T here are five episodes left of the first season of NBC’s musical drama “Smash,” and things are 
looking pretty grim. You’d think the 
writers of a show initially referred 

to as the anti-”Glee” would try to 
learn from the mistakes of their 
predecessors. 

But first, let’s go back in time 
a bit. When the pilot for “Smash” 
premiered in early February, critics 
showered it with adulation — and 
rightly so. The show started out 
strong, with all the necessary star 
power to drive the series: Steven 
Spielberg as one of the producers 
and an ensemble cast featuring 
experienced actors Debra Messing, 
Jack Davenport and Anjelica 
Huston. Many theater fanatics 
hoped that “Smash” would be 
the show that spread the cheer of 
Broadway to the masses.

And such optimism would be 
totally valid. In the initial epi-
sodes of this first season, “Smash” 
seamlessly combined the talent of 
Broadway singing with a compre-
hensive look at all the players in the 
Broadway world — the writers, the 
producers, the directors, etc. There 
was something fresh and unique 
about examining the personal rela-
tionships between these musical-
obsessives while also showcasing 
original musical compositions 
and the vocal talent of the actors 
(Katharine McPhee and Megan 
Hilty). 

Now back to the present: 
“Smash” sucks. Every new episode 
just pushes the show a step lower 
on the downward spiral that it ini-
tially tried so hard to avoid. 

As we near the end of the sea-
son, it’s apparent that the original 
premise of the show (two up-and-
coming Broadway singers compet-
ing for a part in a new musical 
based on Marilyn Monroe) has 
become completely bogged down 
with overly dramatic side plots, 
shallow, unlikeable characters and 
overproduced pop covers. 

By shifting the focus from the 
genuinely interesting interactions 
between all the characters as they 
produce the musical, to a focus on 
each individual character’s unre-
lated life, writers are able to bring 
more storylines into the show, 
resulting in the overly dramatic, 
tedious nature of the latter half of 
the season. What is particularly 
irritating, for example, is the affair 
that Debra Messing’s married 
character (the songwriter of the 
Marilyn musical) has with another 
one of the stars, complete with her 
husband finding out, getting upset 
and crying. 

The writers have also stretched 
the plot’s main dilemma too thin: 
The turmoil of the “who’s going to 
get the part of Marilyn dun dun 
dun” conflict between the two main 
characters — Ivy and Karen — has 
cycled through so many contrived

As its name implies, third-year MFA playwright David 
Myers’ “Gas House Baby” is a pressure-cooker family 
drama in the most electrifying sense. But like Myers’ past 
scripts, his latest promises to defy convention.

“My play is about a young man who goes from being a 
son to being a father,” Myers told the Guardian in an email 
Tuesday. “His mother refuses to let him go and the two get 
locked in a turf war over the leadership of the family and 
the house. Things are made more complicated as the family 
home is on top of a large and valuable natural gas reserve. The 
potential for enormous wealth and enormous poison filter 
throughout the play and transform the characters’ lives.”

Myers’ last play, “Small Prophecies,” premiered at last 
year’s Baldwin New Play Festival and 
was nominated for the San Diego 
Critics Circle Award for Outstanding 
New Play. 

“Recently, I’ve been writing about 
family a lot,” Myers said. “I hope that my 
play this year is a nice mix of a political 
hot button issue — fracking for natu-
ral gas — and the family drama. The 
Baldwin New Play Festival is one of my 
favorite things about UCSD, and I hope 
that lots of people come check it out.”

At the Mandell Weiss Forum Theater 
Wednesday April 18 through Thursday 
April 26. $10 for UCSD students. Doors

BALDWIN
NEW
PLAY

FESTIVAL
By Ren Ebel

Hiatus Editor

UCSD’s yearly showcase of plays written by our own talented MFA 
playwrights returns next week with four brand new productions from some 
of the most groundbreaking voices in contemporary theatre. This year, the 
Baldwin New Play Festival offers everything from searing family drama 
and historical fiction, to collegiate coming-of-age and one diabolical, hook-
handed son of a bitch.

Writer of last year’s delightfully oddball 
and sentimental “A Man, His Wife, and His 
Hat,” Lauren Yee returns to the Baldwin 
New Play Festival with “Hookman,” an 
existential comedy about surviving your 
first year of college (and a deranged, hook-
handed murderer).

““Hookman” explores the typically non-
dramatic: ambivalence, awkwardness — the 
intangible moments of life that fill so much 
of our days but are rarely closely exam-
ined,” Yee told the Guardian in an email 
Wednesday. “It is a slasher play where the 
title character may be more than just terrify-
ing, just as death is simultaneously terrify-

ing, mundane, awkward and awesome.”
Dually inspired by a childhood ghost story and 

Yee’s own emotional ambivalence after the death of 
an acquaintance, “Hookman” translates uncertainty 
and teenage turmoil into full-blown B-movie gore. As 
the mysterious Hookman begins his bloody rampage, 
Lexi (Sarah Halford) must navigate early adulthood’s 
proverbial crossroads without being literally hacked 
to pieces.

“Producing our work at the festival with the kind 
of production values and care that can be had at 
UCSD is amazing,” Yee said. “You ask for something 
impossible and, generally, they can make it happen. 
For instance, “Hookman” calls for a giant girl-killing 
hook that squirts blood all over the place.”

At the Theodore and Adele Shank Theater 
Thursday April 19 through Saturday April 28. $10 for 
UCSD students. Doors open at 8 p.m.

Winner of this year’s Lorraine Hansberry 
Playwriting Award, Jeff Augustin’s “Cry Old 
Kingdom” takes place in 1964 Haiti, amidst 
massive political unrest. As Francois “Papa Doc” 
Duvalier terrorizes citizens and Haitian rebels 
plot a violent overthrow, a young man (Maurice 
Williams) builds a boat with the hopes of escap-
ing to America. He is befriended by a painter in 
hiding (Gerard Joseph), while the painter’s wife 
(Jasmine St. Clair) joins the revolutionary front.

“In Haiti, at night, entire villages gather 
around fires and candlelight to listen to folk-
lore from a single storyteller,” Augustin said in 
a statement sent to the Guardian Wednesday. 
“This tradition has heavily influenced my writ-
ing. The other worldliness, the power of lan-

guage... but I’m also interested in our battle with 
history. How it defines us. How we embrace it 
or try to escape from it.”

With the help of director Kate Jopson, 
Augustin’s “Cry Old Kingdom” may be his most 
personal work to date.

“My mom was born a year before Duvalier 
came into reign, and left Haiti a few years after 
his son came into power,” Augustin said. “My 
mom would tell these stories about growing up 
during that time. I became fascinated with that 
era and what it did and has done to the people 
of Haiti.”

At the Arthur Wagner Theater Friday April 
20 through Saturday April 28. $5 for UCSD stu-
dents. Doors open at 8 p.m.

CRY OLD KINGDOM

SANTA BARBARIANS

Set amid the semi-nostalgic throes 
of 2005 — the economic downturn, the 
war in Iraq, the second half of the Bush 
administration — “Santa Barbarians” 
follows four recent college grads as they 
face the impossible task of figuring out 
what they’re going to do with the rest of 
their lives.

“As they play poker, wait tables, hook 
up and get high, the pressures of the 
world grow until one fateful night when 
all hell breaks loose,” says playwright 
Sharif Abu-Hamdeh on the Baldwin New 
Play Festival website. “Nothing will be 
the same afterwards.”

Abu-Hamdeh was introduced to the-

atre during his time at UC Santa Barbara, 
where he co-founded and edited the art 
and literary magazine Mused. His first 
play, “Habibi,” was an intimate portrait 
of a Palestinian immigrant family living 
in the United States, and was produced 
by the Campo Santo Theatre Company 
in Fall 2010. In “Santa Barbarians,” Abu-
Hamdeh brings his poignant and humor-
ous character studies to the forefront of 
our impending post-college anxiety. The 
play is directed by Joshua Kahan Brody.

twists and turns that it has become 
tiring to watch.

The main thing “Smash” had 
going for it was the wonder-
fully choreographed and composed 
original musical numbers. Why the 
writers have now decided to focus 
more on canned subplots and cov-
ering mainstream popular music is 
beyond me, but it’s safe to say that 
the higher quality musical aspects 
of “Smash” have all but disappeared. 
Now, most of any given episode is 
rife with wooden dialogue and a 
bad Rihanna or Adele cover.

Instead of offering a viable, 

mature alternative for disgruntled 
“Glee” fans, “Smash” has essen-
tially turned into a lesser version 
of “Glee.” Now there’s a huge prob-
lem with that: the whole premise 
of “Glee” is to caricature and 
deconstruct stereotypes, arguably 
justifying the contrived and irritat-
ing characters that complete the 
show. “Smash,” without this sort 
of anthropological endeavor, has 
no excuse for all of its aggravat-
ingly annoying and weak-willed 
characters. And no, the attempts to 
have famous guest stars like Uma 
Thurman and Nick Jonas guest star 
in every other episode do not help 

at all.
Regardless of what I have to 

say, the continual decline in rat-
ings for “Smash” speaks for itself. 
The only reason why “Smash” has 
managed to stay afloat is due to 
its strategic placement behind the 
popular musical reality show, “The 
Voice.” Sure, “Smash” was renewed 
for a second season, but in doing so 
producers also fired head honcho 
and show creator Theresa Rebeck, 
realizing that things need to change 
in order for this show to stay alive. 
Hopefully that will give “Smash” the 
time it needs to develop into some-
thing actually worth following.

CHAIRLIFT & NITE JEWEL
THE CASBAH / APRIL 12, 9 P.M. / $14

Something, the recently-released sophomore album of Brooklyn-via-
Colorado synth pop band Chairlift, is remarkable in its ability to evoke 
pop music’s past (see highlight “I Belong in Your Arms, which sounds 
like the entirety of ‘80s radio pop condensed into one three-and-a-half-
minute slice) while sounding undeniably fresh. This Thursday, Chairlift 
perform at San Diego’s Casbah. Delightfully dramatic LA synth-pop 
songstress Nite Jewel opens. (AW)

SBTRKT & MACHINEDRUM
HOUSE OF BLUES/ APRIL 13, 9 P.M. / $5

Though the last year has seen an onslaught of 
quirky, pop-flirtatious UK dance experimentalists, 
SBTRKT, with their classic R&B vocal melodies 
and sleek, radio-friendly house beats, represent 
one of the most promising young English 
producers currently making music. Check out 
tracks like the infectious “Heatwave” (featuring 
Yukimi Nagano from Little Dragon on vocals) 
or summer anthem “Pharaohs.” Featuring 
an opening set by gloomy, romantic 2-step 
producer Machinedrum. (AW) 

ALBUM REVIEW

I nga Copeland and Dean Blunt, formerly known as Hype Williams, are among the stranger 
artists signed to UK dance label 
Hyperdub. Unlike more dancefloor-
minded labelmates such as Burial 
and Ikonika, Copeland and Blunt 
craft spacious, minimal experimen-
tal rock reminiscent of artists like 
Sun Araw and Peaking Lights. Their 

third album, Black is Beautiful, rep-
resents a tightening of their sound.

Opening track “Venice 
Dreamway” (each of the album’s 
other fourteen tracks is titled “Dean 
Blunt & Inga Copeland”) sees the 
duo in familiar territory, exploring 
dusty synthesizer atmosphere and 
cluttered samples. The second track, 
a cover of Donnie & Joe Emerson’s 
smooth 1979 soul song “Baby,” is 
unusually conventional for Copeland 
and Blunt; its steady drums and 
clean vocals lending it a sense of 
straightforwardness that seems 
almost haunting when presented 
alongside the chaos of the rest of the 
album. 

Other tracks indulge in a more 
refined version of Hype Williams’ 
sound. Their usual cacophony of 
improvised percussion is slightly 

restrained and their samples bear 
less distortion than normal. This 
is still very experimental music 
though, and sometimes the band’s 
willingness to explore outweighs 
their ability to write cohesive songs, 
resulting in an album that often 
fails to engage with the listener after 
repeated listens.

That’s not to say that Black is 
Beautiful isn’t a rewarding listen: 
Inga Copeland and Dean Blunt are 
talented producers, and they often 
stumble upon fascinating artistic 
ground. However, there isn’t enough 
reward across Black is Beautiful’s 
fifteen disorienting tracks to warrant 
the moments of dull experimenta-
tion.

of the UCSD Policy and Records 
Administration, FERPA legally allows 
for the release of such information, 
but does not require the university 
to release said information to third 
parties. Though I had emailed my 
request using a UCSD email, I did 
not explicitly state my current status 
as a student. 

“The university withholds this 
information to protect student priva-
cy,” Johnson said. “We do not release 
this information to third parties.”

She explained that while students 
can access this information — and 
it was therefore possible for me to 
obtain the spreadsheet internally 
through the Registrar — the uni-
versity avoids releasing it to protect 
student privacy. Johnson cited spe-
cific provisions of the CPRA — Govt. 
Code § 6254(c) and 6255) and the 
California Information Practices Act 
(Civil Code § 1798 et seq; e.g., 1798.24 
and 1798.60) —  which showed that 
there was no legal ground for third 
parties to obtain this information. 
She referred me to the Registrar. 

***

Although denied by Johnson and 
the CPRA, I received a response from 
Melissa Ciandro at the Registrar. 

She first asked me if I had busi-
ness with the university, since the 
Registrar tries to confirm the reason 
for the data request to best tailor the 
information provided. 

I explained that my data request 
was out of personal curiosity, and 
identified myself as a member of the 
Guardian staff. The UCSD Policy and 
Procedure Manual provides a form 
that needs to be filled out for each 
request; I did this electronically, pro-
viding my name, address and phone 
number. I did not need to provide my 
PID, student ID card or photo identi-
fication. Throughout this exchange, I 
never saw Ciandro face to face. 

She then explained that the charge 
for the information is $75 per hour, 
with a one-hour minimum to set up 
the file I requested. I was required 
to provide my personal informa-
tion so the Registrar could set up an 
account to record the charge. Usually, 
Ciandro will create an invoice, send 
it to the requestor and the request 
sends back a check made out to the 
UC Regents — this ensures that she 

does not release the information 
without receiving payment. After the 
file is released and the check depos-
ited, Ciandro sends the receipt back 
to the requestor. In my particular 
case, I did not write a check and 
instead charged the document to the 
Guardian’s account. I also had the 
option of renewing the list each quar-
ter with new enrollments, for a recur-
ring charge. I declined. 

After 14 emails and a $75 charge, 
I had the document. 

Any student can access this infor-
mation, Haid said. 

“Students can walk up to the 
Registrar’s office and informally ask 
for information about another stu-
dent,” he said. “If we 
have it on file, and the 
student has not opted 
to restrict it, we will 
provide this public 
information. We don’t 
often get requests. The 
$75 fee is meant to be 
a deterrent, and it is 
a one-time fee, as we 
ask that the informa-
tion is provided solely 
to the person who paid 
for it and cannot be re-
released.” 

Ciandro also 
emphasized that tthe 
document she pro-
vided was for personal 
use and could not be 
re-released or shared. 
She specified that the 
information was for 
personal use, and the 
document should not 
be duplicated or shared. 

It’s been nearly a month since I 
first requested the information and, 
as far as I know, there is no way for 
the Registrar to keep me accountable 
to my promise of keeping the infor-
mation private. I can think of no way 
for them to know if I have forwarded 
the contact information to anyone, 
made copies for a different student 
organization, or sold it illegally to 
pesky credit card companies that live 
to prey on college students’ debt. 
Although I have not done any of the 
above, the release of this informa-
tion seems to operate on an honor 
system without a way to ensure that 
the information is not widely released 
once one person has a copy. 

I did not receive a briefing on the 
legal limitations of how this informa-

tion could be used — or the conse-
quences if I leaked the document or 
decided to use my new knowledge of 
personal addresses to harm someone.

There is a UC Policy on 
Safeguarding Resources and 
Investigating Misuse of Resources, 
last amended in 1981, but the version 
online does not specify consequences 
for said misuse.

***

There’s two pieces of good news. 
First, both Haid and Ciandro said 
that although any UCSD student can 
go through this process, the Registrar 
does not provide directory informa-

tion to third parties.
Second, relative-

ly few people have 
accessed this informa-
tion in the past three 
years. I requested a 
second spreadsheet 
detailing everyone 
who has requested 
data since 2009. The 
list included 60 names, 
mine included, all of 
them affiliated with 
an organization. The 
people included had 
requested various 
combinations of infor-
mation (seniors only, 
18+, all incoming male 
freshmen, all students 
with 3.0+ GPAs, etc). 

Those who request-
ed the information 
included the mili-
tary (as required by 

the Solomon Amendment, which 
allows the Secretary of Defense to 
deny funding to universities if they 
block recruitment activity), various 
UC campuses, the UCSD Bookstore, 
the Associated Students, UCSD 
Extension and the Phi Sigma Pi 
honor fraternity. 

“All of these customers agree to 
this data being used by them only 
and a one-time use,” Ciandro wrote 
in an email. “All students with FERPA 
holds are excluded from the data files. 
All data requests are routed to me and 
I investigate as I did with you to find 
out who you are and what you need 
the data for.”

But after all this, I still don’t 
have exact confirmation that Gupta 
requested information from the 
Registrar to send his all-campus 

email. He was not directly included in 
the list of students who had request-
ed access to such data,  although 
there is an October 2009 request 
for all student data from Associated 
Students under then-Director Lauren 
Weiner’s name. This request occurred 
during Gupta’s 2009-10 tenure as 
A.S. President, showing that the 
Associated Students then, at least, 
had access to the information dur-
ing that time. Weiner requested the 
same information in October 2010; 
in 2011, the Associated Students 
requested data for all seniors and 
transfer students. 

Personally, I restricted my infor-
mation as a freshman in Fall Quarter 
2009. I still received Gupta’s email, 
although this could easily be because 
we have been communicating via my 
UCSD email for years. 

***

With each week bringing another 
story about employers asking appli-
cants for their Facebook passwords or 
a trend piece on varied uses of email, 
online communication is clearly 
changing. 

Haid, of the University Registrar, 
sat on the Student Messaging 
Committee charged by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue to revise campus communica-
tion guidelines. The group, which 
concluded its work in February 2012, 
has made two main recommenda-
tions to Rue.

In September, the group success-
fully took down the aforementioned 
student online directory.

“Even though an online direc-
tory and its info is legal and public, 
students don’t realize that it is easily 
available and there’s a trend among 
UCs to have more restriction on this 
type of info,” Haid said.

Currently, the student directories 
of UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Irvine 
UC Davis and UCSC are open to 
the public, though most provide 
only the student’s email. UC Santa 
Barbara’s student directory can only 
be accessed by those who sign into 
the campus email server. 

Haid said that the change was 
spurred by occasional complaints 
from students concerned about their 
information and worried about iden-
tity theft and safety, especially in 
regard to ex-boyfriends or girlfriends. 
The group realized that since the 

university has no legal obligation to 
make the information publicly avail-
able, it would be in the best interest 
of student privacy to take down the 
directory. 

“The directory started as a paper 
book, back when technology was 
different and people needed more 
access,” he said. “Now, with tech-
nology changed, there are so many 
other avenues in which one can find 
this information. We provide class 
lists and rosters, and people can use 
Facebook.” 

Haid said that the group chose 
not to make directory information 
an opt-in process (in which stu-
dents would have their information 
restricted unless they acted to un-
restrict it) because there was not 
enough demand. 

“We rarely ever receive complaints 
about the directory, and we addressed 
the issue by taking down the direc-
tory,” he said. “Creating an opt-out 
system would require redesigning the 
entire system, which we felt wasn’t 
necessary.”

Student Messaging Committee 
Undergraduate Representative Alex 
Greco applauded the group’s efforts. 

“They pushed [the closing of the 
online directory] through in fall, and 
it really addressed a lot of issues,” he 
said. “The opt-out idea didn’t really 
come up; the purpose of the group 
was to analyze these issues and see 
what was lacking, not necessarily 
tackle anything as a problem.”

The second recommendation of 
the Student Messaging Committee 
was to divide university communica-
tion into mandatory and non-manda-
tory emails. If this recommendation 
is implemented, students will still 
be responsible for reading manda-
tory emails — about grades, admis-
sions, enrollment — which will be 
labeled with a special banner. Non-
mandatory emails — for instance, 
parking, construction and event 
notices — will be labeled differently 
and students will have the ability to 
opt out.

“I personally think that this is a 
very important process that will poten-
tially impact students for some time to 
come,” Greco said. 

The Student Messaging Committee 
presented its recommendations to Vice 
Chancellor Rue in April.

Sophomore catcher Caitlin Brown 
struck a big single to center field. 
With Willmon on second and 
Brown on first, Swanberg came up 
big again for the Tritons, singling to 
bring home Willmon. 

Gaito retired the next three 
batters in order to seal the win for 
the Tritons.

fourth season win in the last game 
of the series. 

UCSD struck first, when in the 
second inning, sophomore Mya 
Romero tripled down the right field 
line to score Swanberg. 

Manuel made quick work out of 
the next three batters in the bottom

TRACK & FIELD — This past 
weekend, April 6 to April 7, the 
Triton Track and Field team split itself 
between the Mangrum Invitational 
and the 33rd Annual Arizona State 
Sun Angel Invitational. 

At Mangrum, junior Ryan Eckert 
won the shot put with a toss of 51’1”, 
outdistancing a talented field coached 
by Olympian Jarred Rome. Senior 
Dane Sandifer also had a standout 
performance, taking second in the 
discus with a throw of 152’2” — 10 
feet off his personal record recorded a 
few weeks ago.

In the hammer throw, UCSD 
alumnus Fred Cook won the 
competition with an effort of 183’2”, 
barely edging out redshirt junior and 
Lebanese national record holder A.B. 
Shaheen, who threw 182’10”. On the 
women’s side, UCSD alumna Danielle 
Thu won the event with a great early 
season mark of 190’3.5”. Junior Shana 
Emile took fourth with her throw of 
147’4”.

Conditions at Mangrum were 
good for all events, with a slight 
wind helping the throws and the 
straight track sprints, as evidenced by 
freshman Keith Rose taking second 
and third place finishes in the 200m 
and 100m dash, respectively. His time 
of 21.94s in the 200m bumps him up 
the CCAA conference list to sixth. His 
sister, Jackie Rose, leads Division II 
for the 400m. At only 0.4 seconds off 
the top of the conference board, the 
younger Rose is trying to make as big 
of a splash as his sister has made in 
her career at UCSD.

Senior sprints captain Rose was 
at the meet in Arizona, where she 
ran well enough to take third place 
in the premier/elite level of the 400m 
dash. At 54.8 seconds — more than 
a second slower than her personal 

record from last week — Rose was 
barely behind Great Britain’s Margaret 
Adeoye, who ran a 53.4s.

UCSD graduate jumper Linda 
Rainwater took third in the high 
jump, clearing a mark of 5’9”. 

“The post-collegiate Tritons are 
really a testament to how far the Track 
and Field program has come,” head 
coach Tony Salerno said. “To have 
members challenging for positions on 
the Olympic Team is amazing.”

Alumni hurdler and Sri Lankan 
Olympic-hopeful Christine Merrill 
also finished third in her event, the 
400m hurdles, with a time of 57.62 
seconds. Graduated sprinter Kelly 
Fogarty finished fifth in the 200m and 
fourth in the 100m dash.

“Our athletes that are training post 
collegiate continue to add energy to 
Triton Track and Field,” UCSD coach 
Darcy Ahner said. “Their continued 
help with the program gives the team 
a great feeling of legacy, because 
having so many athletes close to the 
qualifying standards for USA Olympic 
Trials is just phenomenal. Its really 

spectacular for any team at any level.”
Senior Erin Langford finished 

sixth in the long jump with a leap of 
18’8.5”.

Nick Howe, senior throw captain, 
popped off a javelin hurl of 229’ 
to take second place in the javelin 
competition after U.S. Olympian Mike 
Hazle fouled his first three throws. His 
throw moves him up from third to 
first in all of Division II. This big of a 
throw early in the season is huge for 
Howe, who suffered dismally last year 
at the 32nd Sun Angel Invite, where 
he threw only 176’11”. Freshman Nash 
Howe also performed well in the 
javelin, throwing 178’8”, just a few feet 
off the top 10 UCSD all-time list. 

The only Triton to set a personal 
record at Sun Angel was Quentin 
McWhorter. 

The junior jumped 48’4.5” to 
annihilate his 46’9” personal record 
from earlier this season. This 
provisional qualifier is good for No. 17 
in Division II, but the perky transfer 
says he’s still got more in the tank 
despite a pulled hamstring earlier in 

the season and a torn up knee, both of 
which are healing properly.

Coach Salerno commented on the 
strength of McWhorter’s performance 
in the Sun Angel meet.

“Well it was about 90 degrees 
hotter than it was last year, so that 
was really nice, but also Quentin 
McWhorter’s triple jump moves him 
to number three on the [UCSD] 
All-Time list and puts him right on 
the bubble for [NCAA] nationals,” 
Salerno said.

Moving into the following few 
weeks, the Tritons are easing up their 
weight-lifting regimen to focus more 
on skill training in preparation for 
the coming CCAA meet, which is 
shaping up to be a great competition 
between perennial rivals Chico State 
and UCSD. 

The two schools have traded the 
conference title several times in the 
past few years. The Tritons travel to 
Pomona Pitzer this Saturday, April 14.

Tritons Go 3-1 at Sonoma State

On Thursday, April 5, every 
Triton in the starting lineup scored 
at least one run to take the first 
game of the series 11–6. 

UCSD won its second game by 
a closer 10–8 margin with the help 
of junior Richard Siegel’s two-run 
homerun. The Tritons took the 
second game of the day 4–1. 

On Saturday, April 7, the Tritons 
came from behind, recording three 
runs in the top of the eighth inning 
to take a 6–4 win.

Now, the Tritons have overtaken 
first place in the CCAA and 

continue to rise in the national 
rankings, receiving 18 points in the 
weekly NCAA Collegiate Baseball 
poll.

The Tritons have three home-
and-away CCAA series remaining, 
with a nonconference two game 
series against Grand Canyon to cap 
regular season play.

But with 12 games left to play 
and three games separating first 
place from third place, Avila says 
the coming CCAA series will be 
crucial for the Tritons.

“This weekend against [CSU] 
Dominguez Hills is the most 

important series of the year,” Avila 
said. “We constantly remind our 
guys to play the game one pitch at 
a time and take it one game at a 
time.”

UCSD continues its homestand 
with two games at Triton Ballpark 
this Thursday and Friday, April 12 
to April 13. 

The Tritons will then travel to 
Dominguez Hills where they will 
complete the series the following 
day, Saturday, April 14.

Baseball Preparing for Postseason Play

SOFTBALL — Coming off of 
a lackluster showing at the 
Tournament of Champions the 
weekend prior, the Tritons won 
three of the four-game series on 
the road against Sonoma State last 
weekend, April 6 to April 7. 

“We did not perform as we 
would have liked to,” sophomore 
catcher Caitlin Brown said in an 
email interview. “Our offense was 
struggling, but at the end of the 
weekend, even though we did not 
come out of the tournament with 
the record we would have wanted, 
it was good motivation to show 
people the team we really are in our 
series against Sonoma.”

With just one regular season 
series remaining, the Tritons are 
one of two CCAA teams to have 
clinched a tournament berth. The 
tournament — held at Arnaiz 
Stadium in Stockton, Calif. — will 
feature the top four seeded teams.

“It’s great knowing that we 
clinched a berth to the tournament 
but we are all still looking to the 
next series to try and improve 
our standings,” Brown said. “We 
aren’t going to change a thing 
from what we’ve been doing 
the whole year. We are going to 
continue to practice hard and make 
improvements until the very end.”   

GAME 1
3-0 UCSD 

The Tritons went up by two 
runs in the top of the first inning, 
as sophomore Charly Swanberg 
doubled to left center to score 
leadoff hitter senior Kris Lesovsky

After sweeping top of the conference Sonoma State, the Tritons overtook �rst place in the CCAA, 12 games out from the end 
of regular season play.

“We are going to stay hungry and focused 
and realize that we have not accomplished 

our goals yet.” — Eric Newman, Head CoachNo. 1

After an overhaul of the Triton coaching staff, which saw 14-year tenured head coach Dan O’Brien’s departure for a 
coaching position at Division I Santa Clara, 
UCSD logged a sluggish start to the 2012 
campaign. The Tritons quickly dropped out 
of the national rankings after suffering losses 
to West Region rivals Western Oregon and 
formerly No. 10 nationally ranked Chico State.

“We knew coming into the season we were 
inexperienced in virtually all facets of the 
game,” assistant coach Rob Avila said in an 
email interview. “Our schedule did not allow 
for us to ease into things as we faced off against 
four veteran teams filled with many junior 
college and Division-I transfers. When you play 
experienced teams they will take advantage of 
your mistakes and that is why we lost many 
close games during that first stretch of the 
season.”

At the start of conference play, the Tritons 
split their first three four-game series — good, 

but not great results for a squad that was used 
to sitting at the top of their conference.

“After going 4–4 to start out in the 
conference, we thought we would still have 
a very good chance to make a run at the 
conference championship,” Avila said. “The guys 
bought in to staying the course and continued 
to work hard every day. Things started to click 
offensively and a few guys and we haven’t 
looked back.”

UCSD seems to have turned the corner in 
their home series against CSU Monterey Bay, 
where the Tritons went 3–1 against the then-No. 
29 nationally ranked Otters. UCSD followed up 
by going 3–1 again at San Francisco State and at 
CSU Stanislaus the weekend after.

“The difference between the last five series 
and our first five is our resolve to practice well 
and play our style of baseball,” head coach Eric 
Newman said in an email interview. “Things 
have really clicked.”

Last weekend against top of the conference 

Sonoma State, who sat at the fringes of the 
national rankings, the Tritons recorded their 
first series sweep of 2012.

“Our mindset going into the Sonoma series 
was to play our style and not focus on what 
anybody else was doing,” Newman said. “We 
didn’t make a bigger deal about that series than 
the other teams we played just because they 
were in first place; we just stayed true to who 
we are and let that speak for itself.”

The Triton rotation was firing on all 
cylinders against the Seawolves. Junior starter 
Ryan Goodbrand pitched six innings, for his 
sixth straight win, in the first game of the series. 
While junior southpaw Richard Kilbury had a 
big weekend, picking up his first two wins of 
the season. 

Against Sonoma, UCSD was in no want of 
offense, as the Tritons recorded 31 runs in their 
four games.
