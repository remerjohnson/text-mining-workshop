A new campus policy autho-rizing the disclosure of stu-dents’ ACS email records 
without prior consent provoked 
outcry among student organiza-
tions concerned with the back-
ground and ethics of the policy. 

In an Oct. 22 e-mail, Senior 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake notified 

staff that the UCSD Electronic 
Communications Procedures and 
Practices Policy had been revised. 
The changes stipulate that, in the 
case of a legal subpoena involv-
ing an accountholder, e-mails sent 
from university ACS accounts can 
be viewed with-
out authorization 
from the account 
holder.

For example, 
in the event that 
the RIAA had 
subpoenaed a 
student for illegal 
file-sharing, the 
university would 

be required to hand over the stu-
dent’s e-mail records without his 
or her consent. 

Similarly, the policy applies to 
student e-mail records requested 
by law enforcement agencies to aid 
in investigations. 

A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta, 
who brought the 
matter to the 
attention of the 
A.S. Council at 
its meeting last 
Wednesday, said 
the issue endan-
gers students’ 
personal privacy, 

as many use their ACS e-mail for 
nonacademic correspondence. 

“A university e-mail is required 
to join the UCSD network on 
Facebook,” Gupta said. “If all your 
Facebook notifications are sent to 
that account, they can be used as 
records by the university for an 
investigation.”

The revised policy states that 
direct monitoring of student 
accounts will not occur, and that 
— except in emergency circum-
stances — the distribution of stu-
dent electronic communication 
must first be authorized in writing 

Newsom 
Drops Bid 
for State 
Governor

By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin

San Francisco Mayor Gavin 
Newsom announced his official 
withdrawal from the 2010 guberna-
torial race  on Oct. 30, leaving the 
Democratic Party without a candi-
date for next November’s election. 

The only other Democratic con-
tender — Attorney General and for-
mer governor Jerry Brown — has 
created an exploratory committee 
to determine 
whether or 
not he should 
run, but has 
not officially 
declared his 
candidacy. 

N e w s o m 
cited family 
reasons for his 
withdrawal.

“With a 
young family 
and responsi-
bilities at City Hall, I have found 
it impossible to commit the time 
required to complete this effort the 
way it needs to and should be done,” 
he said in a statement. 

UCSD College Democrat Vice 
President Andrew Wung said 
Newsom’s decision can likely be 
attributed to the high cost of running 
a gubernatorial campaign and the 
20-point lead Brown maintained in 
several recent polls. 

In 2003, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger spent $13.2 million 
on his campaign. Brown has so far 
raised $7.3 million, while Newsom 
raised only $1.6 million during his 
seven-month campaign. 

The Field Poll — a nonpartisan 
organization that asked 1,005 people 
about their voting preferences over 
a 20-day period — revealed that, 
between Brown and Newsom, 47 per-
cent of Californians said they would 
vote Brown, while only 27 percent 
said they would support Newsom.

“He couldn’t pick up the numbers 
… even though, at UCSD, he found 
a lot of support from the students,” 
Wong said. “I find that outside of 

Support from Bay Area, 
young voters not enough 
to beat Brown in 
preliminary polls.

Medical students around 
the world are thanking Michael 
Fujinaka, a student at the UCSD 
Medical School, for adding the iMur-
mur to the growing list of iPhone 
applications being used to facilitate 
quicker, easier student life. 

Launched in June 2009, the 
iMurmur is an iPhone and iTouch 
application that allows medical 
students to compare the sound of a 
normal heartbeat to the sounds of 21 
different types of heart murmurs or 
irregularities in a one’s heartbeat.

Each type of heart murmur has 
a distinct sound; iMurmur provides 

clips of the most common types. The 
ability to distinguish 
a normal heartbeat 
from an irregular 
one is a skill that 
most medical stu-
dents don’t learn 
until their third year 
of medical school.

Fujinaka, who 
said he believes that 
students should be 
able to practice lis-
tening to murmurs 
earlier, developed 
iMurmur in his first 
year at the UCSD 
School of Medicine.

“Almost every 
one of the 17,000 
new first-year 
medical students 
purchase a stetho-
scope, and most 
will not receive 
enough training with it before they 

begin their third and fourth years 
of medical school,” 
Fujinaka said. “This 
is when medical 
students are in the 
hospitals and clin-
ics full-time, learn-
ing by practicing on 
patients.”

Shortly after 
iMurmer was 
released, Thinklabs 
Medical — an 
electronic stetho-
scope company 
— purchased the 
rights to the appli-
cation. Thinklabs 
CEO Clive Smith 
said iMurmur is 
a convenient tool 
for students using 
stethoscopes. 

“The art of 
physical diagnosis 

is challenging for medical students,” 

Smith said. “[The iMurmur is] an 
educational tool that’s in a medium 
well understood by this generation of 
students.”

Fujinaka said he can recall a doc-
tor telling him that less than 20 years 
ago, medical students had to gather 
around one huge machine and use 
headphones to listen to heartbeats. 
The system has since been replaced 
by pocketsized machines — and, now, 
iMurmur.

The application is available 
for $2.99 in the Apple App Store 
under the “Skill Development” cat-
egory. Since its release, iMurmur has 
become the second most purchased 
medical application.

Fujinaka said he is developing a 
new application to be released within 
the month, but is keeping all informa-
tion about the latest release confiden-
tial because it is still being developed.

Critically acclaimed 
program is now Apple’s 
second most downloaded 
medical App.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS
by a vice chancellor. 

However, Gupta said the new pol-
icy still constitutes an invasion of pri-
vacy for those unaware of its effects. 

“Faculty are employed by the uni-
versity, so they expect their records to 
belong to the university, but students 
are not employees,” he said. “Students 
have a right to know what’s hap-
pening with their records, especially 
since there’s such a heavy use of elec-
tronic communication.”

The process by which the policy 
was drafted has also roused con-
cern among student leaders. The 
changes were implemented by the 
UCSD Electronic Communications 
Procedures and Practices Committee, 
an 11-member group consisting 
entirely of faculty and administration. 

Gupta and Graduate Student 
Association President Alex James said 
students should have been included 
in the policy’s revision process. 

“We’re just trying to figure out 
where this came from and why no 
students had any say in this,” James 
said. “Almost every group or com-
mittee includes some form of student 
representation, so this definitely feels 
like back-door negotiation.”

Gupta and James said they are 
currently working on further investi-
gating the policy.

“There was no student representa-
tion on the committee that created 
these changes,” Gupta said. “There 
were no minutes taken at the meetings 
where it was developed and discussed, 
and a lot of this was done in the dark.” 

James said he is more concerned 
with the issue of student notification.

“If someone requests the personal 
information of a student and some-
thing could happen to the student if 
the information is handed over, the 
student should be notified of what 
the university does,” he said. 

The policy specifies that the uni-
versity must eventually notify indi-
viduals if their records are distrib-
uted and must provide a reason for 
this distribution. However, notifica-
tion may come after the records have 
already been copied and used. 

According to committee chair 
Brian Schottlaender, the policy writ-
ing committee was established in 
2006 by then-Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Marsha Chandler 
for the purpose of revising the policy 
for UCSD. The committee has met 
three times since then: in November 
2006, April 2007 and March 2009. 

In 2005, the UC Office of the 
President revised the systemwide 
Electronic Communications Policy,  
which was first created in 2000. The 
new UCSD draft was established in 
response to orders from UCOP that 
all UCs must develop a clear campus-
specific version consistent with the 
systemwide policy. 

Schottlaender said UCSD’s policy 
adaptation clarifies the procedure in 
cases involving legal action. 

“Prior to the revised policy, many 
outcomes relating to e-mail commu-
nications and how such communica-
tions should be handled under vari-
ous circumstances were vague and 

ambiguous,” he said.
While Schottlaender acknowl-

edged the lack of student involve-
ment, he said the university provided 
ample time for student comment by 
holding a public review period from 
Nov. 6, 2008 to Jan. 16, 2009.

“The revised ECPP was the product 
of several years’ work,” Schottlaender 
said. “It reflects the extensive solicita-
tion and incorporation of comments 
from the campus community.” 

He said that, of the few student 
comments received during the public 
input period, most were concerned 
with advertising and disposition of 
electronic communication records in 
the event of student or faculty death 
— not student privacy or communi-
cation records. 

Gupta said the council is working 
to fight the policy, though council-
members have not yet established a 
definite plan of attack.

“It’s a policy already, so it’s hard 
to change,” he said. “But if policy can 
be reversed so that students’ e-mail 
accounts are not monitored, we will 
pursue that.”

Schottlaender said he is open to 
more student involvement. 

“I welcome student input,” he said. 
“I am certain that Vice Chancellor [of 
Academic Affairs] Paul Drake would 
be happy to have a student representa-
tive join the committee now, if either 
A.S. or G.S.A. — or both — would like 
to designate a representative.”

W ith a few culinary undertakings under my now much-tighter belt, 
I can tell you firsthand: Cooking 
is a humbling test of patience, 
organization and mental fortitude 
— hardly something you’d want to 
add to the nauseating schedule of a 
UCSD student.

There is perhaps no clearer 
depiction of the collegiate aver-
sion to cooking than a peak in 
my refrigerator. For someone who 
proudly touts himself as a self-
taught cook, my fridge is hypo-
critically sparse. A true bachelor’s 
box, it features two half-consumed 
Trumer Pilsner six-packs, a few 
sandwich fixings, cream cheese (no 
bagels), a solitary onion, a bulb of 
garlic and an array of condiments. 

My saving graces for this par-
ticular night in — two pink chicken 
breasts — sat forlornly in the meat 
drawer. Fresh produce was absent, 
and frankly, sort of unwelcome.

Jaded from the soggy memory 
of too many Dos Primos burritos 

in my stomach, too 
broke to afford any-
thing else outside 
fast food (despite 
my lucrative jour-
nalistic income) 
and sickened by 
thought of another 
greasy cheese ball 
between toast, I 

racked my brain for a recipe that 
could put my measly fixings to use. 

Objective: transform as many of 
my end-of-week riffraff remains as 
possible into something edible.

Wary that my taste buds would 
soon give in to a quick PB&J 
sandwich, I begged the Internet to 
solve my dilemma. With a mea-
sured degree of skepticism and low 
expectations, I Googled “student-
friendly recipes”. 

Soon, I stumbled upon an 
unsuspecting Web site by a British 
cooking entrepreneur named Tom 
Tuke-Hastings; and suddenly, I 
was in kitchen-noob Nirvana. His 
site, www.cookingbynumbers.com, 
offered me two locations by which 
I could evaluate the worth of my 
scanty food stash: my fridge and 
my spice cabinet. I was given a bal-
lot-style list of ingredient options 
that are typically found in fridges 
and cupboards. 

I went through each ballot, 
checking off my random kitchenfull 
— like “American Idol,” but juicier. 

Half of me expected the survey 
to declare my ingredients unusable, 
yet I couldn’t help but feel a creep-
ing sense of excitement as I clicked 
the “Find Recipes” button.

To my astonishment, the search 
yielded over ten pages of recipes. 
All of them were pretty easy, too. 
Apparently, I could utilize my cream 
cheese, solitary onion, garlic, ran-
dom spices and chicken breasts to 
make a “chicken and cheese parcel” 
dish in less than 20 minutes. What’s 
more, the preparation involved

STATE NEWS  — State Senate Majority 
Leader Alberto Torrico (D-Calif.) pitched 
a new bill in February that would pump 
almost 10 percent of California oil profits 
into higher education. But, as tempting as 
this modern Robin Hood system may be, we 
can’t lean the fate of an already dwindling 
higher education on a depleting natural 
resource.

The bill would eventually generate over 
$1.5 billion a year by placing a 9.9% tax on 
in-state oil drilling, and could theoretically 
put an end to professor furloughs, climbing 
student fees and swelling class sizes. Of that 
$1.5 billion, $270 million would be desig-
nated to the UC system, $540 million to the 
California State University system and $99 
million to community colleges (despite the 
fact that, with an enrollment of nearly 3 mil-
lion, they boast over ten times more students 
than the UC). 

The fact that both UC and CSU officials 
have taken a stand against the bill — despite 
the fact that it’s supposed to benefit them 
— is especially telling. Their major concern: 
If state government higher-ups believe oil 
companies are providing public colleges and 
universities with sufficient funding, they 
might cut state funding even more to free 
up money for California’s other myriad of 
problems — leaving us sucking from a dry-
ing industry. 

For the 2008-09 academic year, the state 
provided the UC with a total of $3.2 bil-
lion — and for this year, that figure’s already 
down by a massive $843 million. If assis-
tance from the big oil companies creates the 
illusion of financial stability, there’s no telling 
how much deeper state cuts might run. 

While the revenue generated by the bill 
might momentarily ease some of the symp-
toms of the budget crisis, we can’t afford to 
ride the coattails of our oil industry off into 
the sunset, especially if it means jeopardizing 
our rightful source of funding: the state.  

In theory, funneling cash from evil cor-
porate giants seems like the perfect solution, 
but it’s not nearly that simple. Oil, after all, 
is a nonrenewable resource. Once we’ve 
siphoned it all into our Escalades, we won’t 
be getting it back anytime soon. It would be 
far wiser to look into growing resources like 

renewable energy for funding, rather than 
one with a heaving finite limit .

In the past seven years alone, California 
reserves have run down 300 million barrels, 
and the state industry has been on a down-
ward slide ever since its peak of productivity 
back in 1985.

Some argue that — because California 
is the only major oil producer in the United 
States that doesn’t demand a severance tax 
on the industry — it’s time higher education 

jumped on the oil-
levying bandwagon. 
Granted, other states 
have used oil prof-
its to their benefit. 
Texas, for instance, 
sets about $400 bil-
lion aside every year 
from mineral and 
oil profits for higher 
education. But with a 
comparatively paltry 
1.4 million students 
(the Golden State 
boasts 3.6 million) 
and 40 percent great-
er oil production, 
an oil tycoon’s dollar 
won’t stretch nearly 
as far in California.

With such great 
differences in context, Texas’s solution may 
not be as one-size-fits-all as we’d hope.

Assembly Bill 656 is hardly the first of 
its kind. In 1981, 2006 and again this year, 
proposals to tax California’s oil industry 
have crashed and burned — primarily out 
of fear that such 
a tax would 
drastically affect 
consumers at the 
pump (a scare 
tactic employed 
by the oil giants 
funding the con 
campaigns). 

Instead of 
just looking at 
the short-term, 
we need to step 
back and con-

sider the possible outcomes of this quick 
fix. Majority Leader Torrico said his bill will 
help public universities systems raise more 
money to support the state’s ever-growing 
student population. But redirecting oil 
profits wouldn’t be the enduring systemic 
change we need — instead, it would slap a 
convenient band-aid onto a gaping slash in 
our budget.

Though the bill is an innovative effort 
to simultaneously provide revenue sources 
for our schools and put pressure on the big 
guys depleting Earth’s resources, the fund-
ing hunt can’t end here: AB 656 should be 
a mere jumping point to better-reasoned 
proposals. Though lobbying policymakers 
at the capital for instance (as UC President 
Mark G. Yudof has proposed) is far from 
a surefire launch out of our budget crisis, 
it would at least avoid making private 
companies responsible for bankrolling our 
education. 

Yudof ’s and Torrico’s proposals should 
both be commended for at least putting new 
solutions on the table — but for any kind of 
sustainable change, we need to get more cre-
ative than targeting a cash-strapped state and 
a few rich oil bandits. Taxing other lucrative 
industries with guaranteed business or loos-
ening state laws to make way for new ones 
(read: legalize it) could pull our universities 
out of the red. Policymakers must follow 
Torrico’s lead in proposing innovative solu-
tions to higher education’s problems — it’s 
our only hope for a furlough-free tomorrow.

revenue 
generated by 
the bill might

the symptoms 
of the budget 
crisis, we can’t

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
I attended the Sept. 16 UC Board 

of Regents meeting as a neutral 
bystander. As I said then in my public 
comments, and privately to anyone 
who would listen, blindly opposing 
fee hikes is irresponsible and counter-
productive. 

I am as opposed in principle to 
fee hikes as anyone. However, I fear 
that most students, the UC Student 
Association and perhaps the Graduate 
Student Association fail to grasp just 
how dire a financial crisis the univer-
sity faces. Money must come from 
somewhere, and without new rev-
enues to address the budget gap, our 
university will slowly crumble until it 
is unrecognizable. 

There are only two possible 
long-term answers: renewing the 
state funding that is consistent with 
the UC master plan, or drastically 
restructuring how the UC system is 
funded. In the short term, there are 
far too many funding shortfalls and 
far too few opportunities for savings 
for a freeze in fee hikes to be even 
remotely practical.

The protests and comments at the 
Sept. 16 UC Regents meeting were 
painful to watch; the regents were 
blamed at every turn for a crisis foist-
ed upon them by the legislature, the 
voters and California’s terribly broken 
political system. The protestors at the 
meeting drew attention away from 
the real causes of fee hikes at a time 

when it is more critical than ever that 
these issues be addressed deliberately 
and rationally. Emotional protests 
against the regents simply make the 
students look childish and hopelessly 
naive.

I imagine I’ll get a lot of flack 
for being a curmudgeon on these 
issues. I am a student, and thus I 
am not insensitive to student con-
cerns. However, I was a Californian 
long before I became a UC student. 
California has built the finest system 
of public higher education the world 
has ever seen. It is no small part of 
what makes California great, and it 
is being threatened with a slide into 
mediocrity that will come faster than 
most people realize.

I hope that any protests GSA 
involves itself in will be coherent, 
thought-out and have a goal of cre-
ating thoughtful discourse about 
the real issues rather than spouting 
the poisonous invective I heard in 
September.

to keep the breasts moist), which 
entailed an impressive presentation 
that would surely score me points 
for international flair.

As I laid out my ingredients, 
disbelief seeped into my head at 
the idea of this actually amounting 
to a solid meal. The preparation 
was minimal. I diced the onion and 
a half-clove of garlic, then mixed 
them into 125 grams of cream 
cheese along with two tablespoons 
of rosemary and thyme (though 
any spices would’ve worked). 
Using two sheets of foil, I created 
a double-layered square tray for 
each chicken breast and spread 

the mixture on. I then covered the 
chicken breasts, slid them into my 
oven — preheated to 400 degrees 
— and, twenty minutes later, they 
were ready.

The foil trays were incredibly 
hot from the oven, so I allowed 
them to sit on the counter for about 
10 minutes until they had cooled. 
As I was ravenously hungry at 
this point, I hastily removed the 
foil covering, grabbed my Trumer 
Pilsner (necessary to the recipe 
or not, the beer was mine for the 
gulping), hoisted the chicken breast 
onto my plate and cut into it. 

The first succulent bite was far 
tastier than my scant ingredients 

foretold. The onion, garlic and 
spices had seeped delicately into 
the chicken breast while in the foil 
wrapping, producing an unparal-
leled hot juiciness with each bite. 
To my astonishment, cooking by 
numbers was a success.

Better believe I turned my 
leftovers into a lunchtime chicken 
sandwich with some lettuce, tomato 
and some bread slapped on to go. 
Thanks to all that handy-dandy 
aluminum, cleanup was virtually 
nonexistent. With some help from 
Tuke-Hastings — and, of course, 
the Internet — I learned that it 
hardly takes any creativity to make 
something out of nothing.

San Francisco, he’s struggling to find 
more numbers — in terms of fund-
raising, in terms of support, etc.”

Brown gained the support of 
unions and a wider range of vot-
ers than Newsom, especially in the 
65-and-over age group. According to 
the Field Poll, Newsom has only 17 
percent of the vote in that demograph-
ic, compared to Brown’s 62 percent.

Analysts have also been speculat-
ing about the potential candidacy of 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D–Calif.), 
who has had stronger numbers than 
Newsom in the past. 

An additional survey taken by the 
Field Poll added Feinstein to the list 

of hypothetical candidates. Between 
Feinstein, Brown and Newsom, 
Feinstein led with 40 percent of the vote 
— coming in ahead of Brown, who had 
27 percent of the vote. Newsom came 
in last with only 16 percent. 

Feinstein, however, has not pub-
licly indicated interest in the 2010 
race.

Newsom had the strongest support 
among voters aged 18 to 39 — the only 
area where he edged out Brown with a 
41-percent approval rating. According 
to Wung, Newsom’s popularity among 
young voters is at least partially due to 
the attention he has placed on issues 
related to college students and, in par-
ticular, the University of California’s 

budget crisis. 
So far, Newsom has been the only 

candidate to directly address the UC 
fee increases and walkouts.

“I favor fully funding the UC sys-
tem,” Newsom said in a statement 
released Sept. 23. 

Wong said Newsom’s views on edu-
cation were critical in his own choice 
to back the San Francisco mayor. 

“Newsom has come out in sup-
port of repealing the tuition increase 
and having a tuition freeze, whereas 
Jerry Brown has not done anything at 
all,” Wung said.

PART 2 How often I hear, “Why 
should I believe in God?  Look at all the killing 

in the name of God, of Christ, of religion!”  It’s 
true that religious people have been guilty of 

atrocities throughout history.  However, the 
charge against religion or Christianity in particular, needs 
some examination.  While it is true that professing 
Christians have committed violence in Christ’s name, they 
have done so illegitimately.  What I mean is that no one 
can point to the teachings or example of Jesus Christ to 
justify such behavior.  Quite the contrary, Jesus taught us 
to love one another, to love our enemies, to turn the other 
cheek--and He modeled what He taught, to the point of 
giving his life for us on the cross.  True Christianity is not 
responsible for atrocities.

It is unfair to clump all religions together, charging that all 
belief in God, without distinction, is responsible for so 
many wars and so much violence.  While some religions 
may propagate violence, most do not.  There is a larger 
issue that has been almost totally ignored by attackers of 
religion.  What about the enormous atrocities committed 
by those who do not believe in God?  Take Hitler, for 
example, responsible for the killing of millions of Jews and 
others who did not fit in his eugenics agenda.  These words 
of Hitler hang on the walls of Nazi death camps in Poland:   
“I freed Germany from the stupid and degrading followers 
of conscience and morality.  We will train young people 
before whom the world will tremble.  I want young people 
capable of violence - imperious, relentless and cruel. “ 

Then there is Stalin, the antitheist mastermind and 
murderer of fifteen million of his own people.  And what 
about Mao, and Mussolini, atheists all.  I am not suggesting 
that all antitheists are guilty of atrocities or of supporting 
atrocities--certainly that is not the case.  But why don’t we 
hear the passionate cry on college campuses demanding to 
know why so much violence and so many atrocities have 
been committed by the antitheists and the irreligious?  
There are many morally upright and compassionate 
antitheists in the world today.  However, they do not derive 
their virtues from antitheism.  To deny the existence of God 
is to inescapably forfeit the right to any frame of reference 
supporting universal moral law.  Ravi Zacharias states, 
“Antitheism provides every reason to be immoral and is 
bereft of any objective point of reference with which to 
condemn any choice.  Any antitheist who lives a moral life 
merely lives better than his or her philosophy warrants” 
(Can Man Live Without God?  p.32).  

In closing, the words of Auschwitz/holocaust survivor 
Victor Frankl in his book, The Doctor and the Soul (p.XXI):  
“The gas chambers of Auschwitz were the ultimate 
consequence of the theory that man is nothing but the 
product of heredity and environment….I am absolutely 
convinced that the gas chambers of Auschwitz…were 
ultimately prepared not in some ministry or other in Berlin, 
but rather at the desks and in lecture hall of nihilistic 
scientists and philosophers.”

Weight of the world’s largest pumpkin, in pounds, 
when grower David Stelts of Leetonia, Ohio, broke the 
record in 2000. It had a circumference of 16 feet.

onsidering UCSD’s sunny 
SoCal allure, longboarding 
down a crowded hill from 
Peterson Hall to Price Center 
during peak hours is practi-

cally a rite of passage for new 
students. 

And, back in the good old days, students 
could even trek to Muir Surf and Sport — 

tucked in a dark alleyway behind El Mercado 
(may its smothered nachos rest in peace) — for 
a 10-minute lesson and a new board.

After Outback Adventures — a university-
sponsored, student-run organization that rents 
outdoor equipment, runs discounted wilder-

ness trips and offers classes — opened its own 
recreational sports shop in Price Center last 
winter, it seemed the UCSD campus wasn’t big 
enough for the both of them. In fear it would 
lose business to Outback, Muir Surf and Skate 

shop moved to Pacific Beach last March to take 
a stab at life outside of UCSD.

“Outback Adventures felt that Muir [Surf 
and Sport] was redundant,” said Assistant Vice 
Chancellor for Student Life, Gary Ratcliff, . “It 
was a duplication of what Outback provided as 

a service. We are not inclined to endorse off-
campus services when the campus is already 
running the similar services.”

According to owner Scott Lembach, Muir 
Surf and Sport had ties with the same brands 

who were looking to do business with 
Outback Adventures. Additionally, skate 
vendors have specific regulations about 
how many venues they sell to within 
a small vicinity. With university sup-
port, Outback Adventures could offer 

those vendors a better deal than what 
Lembach could afford.

Lembach said he was under the 
impression that the new Outback 
Adventures Surf Shop would focus 
more on the sale of equipment, 

which would threaten his own 
customer base — a primary 
reason for his departure. Thus, 
he said he was surprised 
and disappointed when he 

recently found out that the 
Outback store ended up

UNCOMMONfolk

BY MIKE STUDZINSKI CONTRIBUTING WRITER

M
uir College sophomore 
Perry Naughton wheeled up 
to UCSD on Sept. 19, 2009 
reeking of sweat, saltwater 

and the accumulated grime of several 
showerless nights. It was 10 a.m., and 
he had four hours to kill until he could 
move into his Muir dorm. Naturally, 
he headed to Black’s beach to catch a 
wave.

Unlike the rest of his classmates, 
Naughton didn’t drive to UCSD from 
his hometown with his family to help 
him move in. Instead, he opted for an 
epic bike tour with his longtime friend 
and fellow Muir College sophomore 
Casey Owen. They traveled the 280-
mile trip from Lompoc, California 
on borrowed G2 bikes, toting a small 
trailer packed with everything they 
would need for five nights of beach 
camping. Strapped on top of course, 
was Naughton’s six-foot-three-inch 
M10 epoxy surfboard.

The pair was inspired to embark 
on the six-day excursion after read-
ing articles in surf magazines about 
similar trips others had taken across 
the country. 

Naughton said he had recently 
begun biking and was looking for a 
challenge. 

Owen and Naughton left Lompoc 
on Monday and planned to be at 
UCSD, ready for the new school year,  
no less than six days later. However, it 
didn’t take them long to realize their 
trip would be a lot tougher than they 
ever expected.

“Our first day was miserable,” 
Naughton said. “We didn’t know how 

long 70 miles would be, and we almost 
didn’t make it. We thought we were 
going to have to turn around.”

That evening, they arrived at 
Carpinteria State Beach and spent the 
night nursing sore limbs. But instead 
of heading back home, they decided to 
keep chugging along the coast, pump-
ing through about 50 miles of riding 
per day. They spent their nights at 

state beaches 
in Carpinteria, 
Malibu, Dana 
Point, Cardiff 
by the Sea and 
one night at 
Owen’s broth-
er’s house in El 
Segundo.

According 
to Naughton, 
the toughest 
part of the trip 
wasn’t navigat-
ing the seaside 
side streets, but 
maneuvering 
urban laby-
rinths like Los 
Angeles and 
Long Beach. 
As  busses were 

often parked in bike lanes, the bikers 
were forced to veer into indifferent 
traffic on more than one occasion.

As could be expected, crotchety 
commuters stuck in rush-hour showed 
little sympathy — not even for two 
sun-burnt boys biking the California 
coast with surfboards and camping 
gear in tow. 

“We definitely got honked at,” 
Naughton said. 

The pair also had trouble building 
speed with the constant impediment 
of red lights. Their trailers — which, 
Naughton estimated, weighed about 
30 pounds — made it noticeably 
harder to peddle, especially after 
being at a standstill. There were times 
when both would fall back despite 
their best efforts to endure the rigor-
ous schedule.

Finally, after piloting their way 
out of the city, the two-man team 
happened upon the 2009 Hurley 
Pro surf contest in Trestles, where 
Naughton said they hit the beach 
with the professionals. 

After a lay day in Trestles, the 
boys decided to round out the last 
leg of their expedition by heading 
south to San Diego — and Fall 
Quarter.

When it was finally 2 p.m. 
on move-in day and Naughton 
picked up the keys to his dorm, 
he said his parents showed up 
with all the things he couldn’t fit 
in his trailer.

It was a trip Naughton says he 
would definitely repeat. Turning 
move-in day into a memo-
rable six-day journey along the 
California coast, Naughton and 
Owen conducted their own cus-
tom Wilderness Orientation and 
squeezed the most out of summer 
2009 — right up to the bitter end.

INFOCUS Muir Pumpkin Drop

When the yearly pumpkin order placed by Muir College Resident Dean Pat Danylyshyn-Adams fell through, the 
fate of a 35-year-old tradition was looking grim.

It seemed the annual Muir Pumpkin Drop 
was in cancellation crosshairs.

That is, until Danylyshyn-Adams decided 
to send out an e-mail to nearly 600 of her past 
House Advisors — pleading them to donate a 
pumpkin large enough to hurl over the top ﬂoor 
of Tioga Hall.

The next morning, former House Advisor 
and Muir College alum Joseph Denzinio sent 
out a request to KUSI, San Diego’s independent 
television news station.

One thing led to another, and weatherman 
Joe Lizura  came through with a pumpkin 
provider to keep the tradition alive, and even 
featured the Muir hopefuls in a televised 
segment.

Last Friday, Oct. 30, students dropped two 
candy-packed 200-pound pumpkins (dubbed 
“In” and “Out”) over an 11-story ledge. And 
although this year’s pumpkin failed to beat the 
college’s record for largest “splat” (currently held 
by 1995’s 398-pound pumpkin, which exploded 
its gourdy guts to over 100 feet from where it 
fell), the festival that followed compensated with 
games, prizes and pumpkin pie.

“Students do miss having a 

skate shop,” Dean of Student 
Affairs at Muir College Patty 
Mahaffey said. “We feel there is 
a niche for the skating culture on 
campus, and the shop was popular 
for people who needed their skate-
boards fixed or to learn safety tips.”

Like most recent graduates, 
Lembach’s shop has had a tough 
time getting used to things on the 
outside. It faces a difficult econo-
my, a new demographic of custom-
ers and a new beach town full of 
competition.

Since its reopening in March 
2009 in Pacific Beach, the store 
has changed quite a bit. According 
to Lembach, sales have been dif-
ficult to keep up. He attributes the 
retail slump to the poor economy 
and the loss of on-campus custom-
ers — who never failed to pour in 
at the beginning of Fall Quarter in 
search of speedier between-class 
transportation. 

Over the summer, Lembach 
scissored the store’s name to Muir 
Skate Shop and decided to drop its 
line of surfing gear.

“You got to have momentum to 
have a surf shop,” Lembach said. 
“We lost that momentum because 
we’re starting all over again.” 

Shoehorned between consign-
ment shops and frozen-yogurt 
joints on the lively Garnet Avenue, 
Muir Skate Shop is just as small 
and cramped as it was on campus, 
except now it boasts a back-room 
ramp on which local boarders can 
grind, carve and shred to their 
heart’s content.

Lembach recently revamped 
Muir Skate Shop’s Web site and 
moved most of his business online. 
Within two weeks of its launch, 
www.muirskate.com was bringing 
in nearly 80 percent of Lembach’s 
sales. 

If the shop doesn’t pull through 
its slump and see increased sales 
soon, Lembach said he might have 
to run the entire enterprise from 
his garage.

Of course, this is not the Muir 
Skate Shop that Lembach envi-
sioned back in 2005, when he took 
a chance on a vacant space in Muir 
College and opened up shop at a 
research university known pre-
dominately for science and engi-
neering. 

It didn’t take long for Lembach’s 
genial personality and the shop’s 
prime pick of Rainbow sandals, 
video games and longboards to 
keep business trafficking all day 
long.

According to Mahaffey, Muir 
conducted a student survey when 
it was trying to determine what 
business would best benefit college 
residents. 

“The survey results indicated 
that they wanted to see a surf shop 
in that space,” said Mahaffey.

According to Mahaffey, a com-
bination of forces drove Muir Skate 
Shop from its popular perch last 
March. Renovations to the Muir 

College quad over the summer 
would have temporarily driven the 
skate shop from its digs, and the 
impending arrival of the Outback 
Adventures Surf Shop further dis-
couraged Lembach from holding 
onto his spot.

In 2004, Outback Adventures 
started scoping out a location for a 
new retail branch in Price Center. 
With the expansion, Outback 
hoped for a more visible presence 
on campus, turning student atten-
tion to the outings and events they 
hold regularly.

The Student Life committee, a 
group of administrators in charge 
of green-lighting campuswide 
funding allocations, approved the 
Outback business venture. Once 
the space opened up in Spring 
Quarter 2009, Outback Adventures 
Surf Shop began preparing to open 
its doors in the central hub of 
campus.

The space where Muir Skate 
Surf and Sport once stood — along 
with the rest of Muir’s student-
life facilities — is currently under 
construction. There are no known 
plans for refilling the space at the 
moment, though Mahaffey said she 
plans to survey students again once 
construction of the Muir Student 
Center has wrapped.

Meanwhile, Lembach has kept 
on three UCSD alumni as part-
time employees. He said he’s main-
tained strong relationships with old 
student regulars who now venture 
out to PB for worn-down wheel 
replacements and other boarding 
needs. 

Now that his business is more 
centrally located within the San 
Diego community, Lembach 
also caters to students from the 
University of San Diego and San 
Diego State University — and any 
other Pacific Beach residents who 
happen to peek their heads in the 
door.

Lembach said he hopes he can 
get Muir Skate Shop back on the 
grind by promoting their curiously 
academic name around San Diego 
and settling into his Pacific Beach 
digs for the most homey feel pos-
sible.

4. Derek Jeter. Yeah, Derek 
Jeter. Why do we have to like Derek 
Jeter? Whenever people talk about 
not liking the Yankees, somebody 
always interjects, “What about 
Jeter?” 

We’ll tell you about Derek Jeter: 
He’s a below-average defensive player, 

his batting average is high because of 
all the guys hitting behind him and 
he has herpes. Don’t just let that go — 
it’s something we need to talk about 
more often. 

Don’t tell us that we can hate the 
Yankees, but we have to like Jeter. We 
don’t like Derek Jeter, and no matter 
how many times Joe Buck and Tim 

McCarver verbally fellate him, I will 
not like Derek Jeter. 

And again, he allegedly has 
herpes, and he allegedly gave those 
herpes to Jessica Alba — and she was 
hot, but now she allegedly has herpes 
too. Screw you, Derek Jeter. Screw 
you for allegedly giving Jessica Alba 
herpes.

With renewed energy, UCSD 
scored the first two goals of the fourth 
quarter to erase Cal State Long Beach’s 
advantage. The 49ers regained their 
lead with a long shot from 10 meters 
out, then added an insurance goal late 
in the period to bring the game to 7-5. 

“It was a good game for us because 
we mixed up our defense a lot,” Harper 
said. “Long Beach has one of the pre-
mier two-meter men in the nation, 
and we did a great job on him. Senior 
two-meter Peter Greshman absolutely 
outplayed him ... It’s too bad we lost, 
but I was pleased with the effort.”

The 49ers goalkeeper had an 
excellent game with 16 saves through-
out the match. Junior driver Bryce 
Madsen led the Tritons offensively 
with three goals. 

UCSD now returns home for its 
final homestand and its first and only 
game at Canyonview this year, due to 
untimely construction. The Tritons 
will honor six seniors before their 
match against Santa Clara University 
on Nov. 7 at 12 p.m. 

“It’s going to be our one and only 
big home game of the year,” Harper 
said. “Students have done a nice 
job and worked hard getting to the 
Coggan Complex, but this is different 
since it’s right on campus ... It’s going 
to be a close game and I’d love to give 
the win to the student body.”

CLASSIFIEDSMONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 200914 THE UCSD GUARDIAN



SPORTS� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

ebrated the season’s final game by 
hosting their annual Senior Day, 
where all eight graduating seniors 
were honored before the start of the 
match. However, family and friends 
was not enough to push the Tritons 
offense to scratch out a victory. 

The starring legacy left behind 
by the team’s 2009 senior class are 
the accomplishments of Akman and 
senior Tony Choi. 

Akman leaves the Triton soccer 
program with the most career saves 
in UCSD school history. Choi holds 
the distinction of graduating with 
more career assists at the Division-
II level than any other Triton soccer 
player.

The match against the CSUDH 
Toros was scoreless until the 73rd 
minute, when a Dominguez Hills 
attacker drove a ball past Akman 
from 18 yards out. A second Toro 
score eight minutes later was too 
much for UCSD to overcome, and 
the 2009 season came to a somber 
close.

Despite a disappointing outcome 
in box scores and standings, Jackson 
said he believes his team has much 
to be proud of at the close of their 
2009 season, including a solid core 
of young players and one of the best 
defenses in the CCAA.

“You can’t really point the finger 
at any aspect of our team for the 
results, and it’s really just a matter 
of so many things that just didn’t go 
our way,” Jackson said. “This year 
has been a great season to build 
upon for next.”

lead before a UCSD rally helped 
regain momentum. Soon after, 
Schmidt notched four consecutive 
kills, tying the set 14-14. 

After swapping leads for the 
remainder of the set, a devastating 
Triton kill propelled UCSD  four 
straight points ahead to close out 
the 25-22 set win.

In the match’s final set, Cal State 
Stanislaus again jumped to a quick 
7-3 lead. 

However, the Tritons soon recov-
ered, setting out on a 
short run to retake the 
lead 10-8. Schmidt’s 19th 
kill of the night opened 
up a Triton scoring spree, 
and the team cruised to 
victory from a 19-14 lead.

Black singled out 
Schmidt’s performance 
as one of the reasons for 
UCSD’s success, but also 
attributed the Tritons’ 
near-perfect record to 
outstanding team play.

“It’s great for Sylvia 
[Schmidt],” Black said. 
“She’s one of the best play-
ers in the country. But 
the entire team is play-
ing really well, and that’s 
helping pull the team together.”

Schmidt echoed her coach.
“Everyone was playing really well 

and really trying,” She said. “We 
were getting all our serves in and 
working together.”

On Halloween night at Chico 
State — where the Tritons hadn’t 
seen victory since 2006 — UCSD 
handled Chico State as Schmidt 
notched another 19 kills, 16 of 
which came in the first two sets. 
Condon added 14 kills for a Triton 
sweep of the Wildcats 25-21, 25-23, 
25-17. 

It was the first time since 2005 
that UCSD had swept a season 

series against Chico State.
Both teams played flawless 

offensive games in the first set, with 
neither team registering a hitting 
error. The Triton offense jumped 
to an 18-11 lead, but the Wildcats 
battled back and continued to chip 
away at the Tritons’ advantage, nar-
rowing the lead to 21-19. 

In the end, the Tritons held off 
the Wildcat charge, and used one 
of their 12 aces of the night to close 
the set 25-21.

“We were passing extremely well 
and working well togeth-
er,” Schmidt said of her 
team’s first-set perfor-
mance.

In the second set, the 
resilient Wildcats fought 
back, leading by as many 
as three points. But 
after an ace by senior 
captain setter Elaine 
Chen, UCSD recap-
tured the lead at 17-16. 
Chico came back to tie 
the game 22-22 before 
Schmidt got her final 
kill of the set to seal the 
25-23 Triton victory.

Condon registered 
eight of her 14 kills in 
the third set. With the 

score at 10-8, Condon nailed four 
consecutive kills as the Tritons went 
on a six-point run. The Wildcats 
could do little to stop the Tritons in 
the third set, and the UCSD assault 
dominated play for the remainder of 
the match as the Tritons breezed to a 
25-17 victory.

 “It feels great to get another 
win,” Schmidt said. “We just take it 
one game at a time and keep play-
ing.”

UCSD is back in action Nov. 4 
when they host Cal State East Bay.

Senior Staff Writer 

MEN’S SOCCER — After a 
promising but ultimatey frus-
trating season, UCSD closed 
out its 2009 campaign with 
a very fitting end: two close 
losses. 

UCSD dropped its match 
with Cal State Los Angeles on 
Oct. 30 1-0 before losing 2-0 
on the final game of the season 
two days later, against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills.

The defeats dropped UCSD 
to 7-9-4 overall and 4-9-3 in 
the California College Athletic 
Association.

“We’ve been real unlucky, 
coming out on the losing side 
of a lot of one-point games,” 
Junior defender Josh Jackson 
said. “[But] Coach Pascale has 
preached to keep working hard 
and playing our game no mat-
ter what.”

On Oct. 30, the Tritons fell 
to No. 7 Cal State Los Angeles 

— who outshot UCSD 12-3 — 
in a 1-0 defeat. 

To a crowd of home fans 
on a warm Friday night, the 
Tritons came out strong against 
CSULA when freshman for-
ward Evan Walker chased 
down a long pass to create a 
breakaway situation against the 
Golden Eagles’ keeper. Walker 
attempted to juke the keeper, 
but the Golden Eagles goalie 
jumped on the ball at Walker’s 
feet to stop the shot. 

The play ended badly for 
both teams: The players collid-
ed, resulting in a head injury to 
the Golden Eagles’ goalkeeper 
that forced him to leave the 
game. 

Carrying a 4-0 shot advan-
tage into the half, Cal State Los 
Angeles scored what would be 
the lone goal of the game in 
the 49th minute. A misplaced 
Triton header was picked up by 
a charging Golden Eagle, who 
booted a driving ball past senior 
UCSD keeper Peter Akman to 

put the Eagles on top.
Five minutes later, the Eagles 

almost doubled their lead 
when junior defender Anton 
Gunnarsson sent a weak shot 
through the box to senior for-
ward Derrek Horn, who waited 
near the front of the net. Horn’s 
drive seemed to be on goal, but 
Akman made a diving save to 
prevent the score. 

UCSD finally showed some 
sign of offensive life in the 
81st minute, when the ball was 
deflected at the top of the pen-
alty box. Bakal launched a solid 
shot on goal but the Cal State 
Los Angeles keeper came up 
with an impressive stop.

With just under a minute 
to play, the Tritons put in their 
final effort. Bakal took a Golden 
Eagle turnover and sent a hard 
shot — but it was stopped again 
by the LA keeper, sealing the 
Triton defeat. 

On Nov. 1, the Tritons cel-

First, an introduction. I, Joe, am a lifelong Angels fan who has watched the team since the 
days when Chili Davis was stealing 
bases, Chuck Finley wasn’t getting 
beat up by women and Jim Abbott 
was doing it all with one hand. My 
partner in crime, Cameron, is a 
lifelong Mariners fan, so he grew up 
having people steal from him and 
beat him up. 

There’s one thing in the world 

of baseball, however, we always can 
agree on. Actually, there are two. 
First, the “Real World/Road Rules 
Challenge” is more exciting than 
baseball. Second, the Yankees suck.

The latter is the issue to which 
this column will be dedicated. 

So here they are: the top four rea-
sons to hate the Yanks.

1. A-Rod. It’s simple: He’s prob-
ably the biggest douche in all of 
baseball. When Alex Rodriguez is not 
in a batter’s box, he’s looking in the 
mirror, flexing and oiling his muscles. 
He used to be an innocent kid ris-
ing to stardom in Seattle — now he 
has blossomed into the sport’s most 
supreme bag o’ asshole. 

When offered a monster contract 
with Seattle, Rodriguez showed his 
true colors by accepting a slightly big-
ger deal with a last-place Texas team. 
He’s a media whore, dating celebrities 
looser than an old sock — including 
Madonna and Kate Hudson  — and 
always on the downside of their 
careers. (Making an Alex Rodriguez-
Betty White pairing extremely pos-
sible, and kind of a sexy prospect.)

2. Johnny Damon. How do you 
go from being the face of the 2004 
World Series Champion “idiot” 
Boston Red Sox team to the New 
York Yankees? He pretty much 
crapped on the entire Red Sox Nation 
when he signed with New York. He 
went from a lovable caveman with 
the facial hair of a Rabbi to a stereo-
typical clean-shaven Yankee pretty 
boy. 

Basically, Damon sold his balls to 
the Steinbrenners, and now isn’t even 
good enough to play in the miniscule 
patch of turf the Yankees call an out-
field. Speaking on behalf of the Red 
Sox Nation: Screw You, Johnny. 

3. The fans/payroll. While the 
Yankees are the epitome of pure 
evil, Yankee fans are the epitome of 
bandwagoneering morons. Yankee 
fans are the most annoying, biased, 
lame, annoying, annoying, annoying 
and irrational of all fanatics — maybe 
even more so than Dodger fans. 

Must be nice to be able to pick up 
every single Type A free agent each 
off-season. It’s like playing MLB ’06, 
altering the management settings, 
giving your team unlimited funds 
and making incredibly uneven trades 
to stock your team with All-Stars. 

There are only three people on 
that team with true Yankee ties, and 
the fans don’t even care. They’re 
happy to root for whatever overpaid, 
overrated, over-the-hill player wan-
ders into town, and then equally as 
content to boo him at first chance.

MEN’S WATER POLO — Haunted by 
early deficits in both matches, the No. 
11 Tritons fell to two top-10 oppo-
nents in their final road trip of the 
regular season. UCSD was edged out 
by No. 8 Cal State Long Beach 7-6 
on Oct. 30 before falling 11-6 to No. 
6 Loyola Marymount University on 
Oct. 31. 

The two losses dropped UCSD’s 
record to 11-13 entering the team’s 
game this Saturday against Santa Clara 
University.

“It’s always a challenging road-
trip anytime you’re going to play an 
[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation] 
opponent on Friday night and then 
face our rivals the next day,” head 
coach Denny Harper said. “I’m pleased 
with our effort Friday. Saturday, not so 
much.”

UCSD entered its game against 
Western Water Polo Association rival 
Loyola Marymount University riding 
a nine-game losing streak against the 
rival Lions squad, which spans across 
three seasons. From the outset, there 
was little sign the Tritons would break 
their LMU slump this weekend.

“LMU has three skilled offensive 
players,” Harper said. “Not surpris-
ingly, two of them are foreigners who 
are tough for us. They are also really 
strong in the goal with [goalkeeper] 
Andy Stevens, who is very difficult to 
score on.”

The Lions shut down UCSD’s 
offense at the start of the game, hold-
ing the Tritons scoreless in the first 
quarter while taking a two-goal lead. 
Junior driver Sean Cruz got UCSD 
on the board in the second — cutting 
LMU’s lead to 2-1 — but the Lions 
answered back with two goals before 
halftime.

Playing from behind, the Tritons 
were able to keep pace with the Lions 
and pull within 7-5 after senior driver 
Sean Roberts’ goal, with 7:18 left in 
regulation. Still, the Tritons could not 
stand up against the relentless Lion 
attack, allowing four LMU goals in the 
final seven minutes.

The Tritons had more six-on-five 
opportunities than the Lions, but were 
less efficient in the conversion rate. 
UCSD went 4-for-9 in man-up situa-
tions, while LMU was 4-for-5. 

UCSD had suffered a one-goal loss 
to non-conference opponent Cal State 
Long Beach the night before. The team 
struggled at the start of the contest, 
falling behind 4-2 at halftime. After 
both squads added a score in the third 
period, they entered the final period 
with the 49ers nursing a 5-3 lead.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — 
Building on an already successful 
season, the No. 2 UCSD women’s 
volleyball team brought home two 

victories following a Halloween 
weekend road trip. 

The Tritons defeated Cal State 
Stanislaus on Oct. 30 and No. 25 
Chico State on Oct. 31, improving 
to 24-1 on the season and boost-
ing their current win streak to 15 
games. 

It was the first time in three 
years that the Tritons beat Chico 
State on the road.

“It’s great to get a victory there,” 
head coach Tom Black said. “We 
played really well. It’s a really tough 

stadium and the city rallies around 
the school, so it’s a really tough 
place to play in.”

On Friday night, senior cap-
tain outside hitter Sylvia Schmidt 
recorded 19 kills against Cal State 
Stanislaus, tying her second-high-
est season total as the Tritons swept 
the Warriors 25-16, 25-22, 25-21. 

In the first set of the night, the 
Tritons scored 12 of the game’s 
first 14 points. Throughout the 
match, Cal State Stanislaus could 
not muster itself within more than 

seven points of the Tritons, with 
UCSD holding a steady lead of as 
much as 11. The Tritons closed the 
match with a kill from sophomore 
outside hitter Katie Condon.

“We really focus on playing one 
point at a time,” Schmidt said. 
“We’re really supportive of each 
other. We are all playing together 
and have confidence in each other.”

In the second set, the Warriors 
took off running, seizing a 10-4 

UCSD swept both 
Stanislaus and Chico 
State to pick up two 
more conference wins.
