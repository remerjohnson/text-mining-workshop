Statistics 
AQMISSIONS: The number of 
racial minorities drops 13.7 
percent across all nine campuses 
By Erika SnIder 
Staff Writer 

Following the release of 1998 admiss ions 
data hy eac h C t:ampus. the U Office of 
Ihe President ( OP) gave an initial sys-
temwide overview of admissions result s last 
Thursday. 

The data rerresents "undurlicated data," 
which means that eat:h student who applied is 
counted onl y once regardless of the number of 

campuse~ applied to. 
The result s showed thai for thc cnlin: U 

system, 44, 93 sludents we re admil ted for 
fa ll 1998 - thc larges t group of high school 
seniors ever to be admilled to UC schools . 
The data also showcd a sys tcmwide det:line 
of underrepresented students , which the UC 
system defines as Afri can Americans, Native 
Americans, Mexican-Amcricans and 
Latinos. 

The data is not completely final. According 
to a statement released hy UCOP, "A full and 
act:Urate picture of Ihe fall 1998 freshman class, 
however, will emerge only after May I, the 
deadline fur students to notify the campus at 
which they plan to enroll." 

Overal l, the admission of African-
Americans declined 17.6 percent from 1,509 to 
1,243; Mexican-Americans dropped 4.7 per-
cent from 4, 165 to 3,969; Latinos det:rcased 
12.9 rercent from 1,520 to 1,325; and Native 
Amerit:ans declined 5.4 percent from 336 to 
3 18. 

The data also showed that the number of 
students who declined to state an ethnic identi -
ty int:reased from 2, 181 in 1997 to 6,346 thi s 
year. However, according to Terry Colvin, UC 
senior public information representative, the 
trend of students det:li ning to state their ethnit: 
identity is not new. 

''This trend has been going on since the 
regents enacted their decision in July 1995 and 
since Prop. 209 was passed," Colvin said.

Prospective Students Get a Taste of UCSD at Admit Day 
VISIT: Five colleges put 
on various activities to 
lure high school emors 
By Vincent Gragnanl 
Staff Writer 

Thousands of prospecti ve 
SO students and their parents 

came to campus Saturday a part of 
the annual UCSD Admit Day. 
There were programs and informa-
tion essions run by each college as 

well by the entire university. 
Muir Provost Pat Ledden said 

he expected about 5,000 people to 
attend the day-long event. Ledden 
also said that the chance of rain 
may have discouraged people from 
attending the event. 

Although it did nOI rain, many 
were prepared for it. Eleanor 
Rooseve lt College administrators 
ori gi nally planned an outdoor event 
on thei r campus but decided last 
Thursday to move their program 

indoors to the International Center. 
Roosevelt Coordinator of 

St udent Affairs Pablo Mendoza said 
event planners had originally intend-
ed to have a multi -cultural festi val 
of music. Building on the theme of 
being the college of international 
affairs. Mendo~~ said Roosevelt 

ollege originally planned on ho ·t-
ing Japanese Taiko drummers, Afro-

uban steel drummers and dancers 
from Holland, Mexico and Peru. 

In the end, because of the lack 

of space and the possibility of rain, 
onty a Scotti sh bagpiper was able 
to attend. However, Mendoza said 
turnout was up despite the last -
minute program changes. 

"We had 70 I reservations," 
Mendoza said. "tn the past, we've 
n ver had above 650."

coordinators also changed their 
plans because of possible rain .

nicated among scientists, policymakers and citizens.

awards ceremony and lunch with conference speaker 
Michael Soule, president of the Wildlands Project and

Leech Nervous System Akin to Humans' 
SCIENCE: Biology 
Professor Kri stan studied 
'leech local bend ' 
By Jeffrey Barker 
Guardian Reporter 

Working with the relali ve ly 
simple neurology of lIIedical leech-
es, UCSD bio logy Pro fessor 
William Kri stan has revealed facts 
about nervous systems that cou Id 
lead to discoveri es in more com-

leech's response to stimuli is that 
it was predicted from work on 
monkeys . 

"M onkeys are prohably as close 
to humans as we' re ever going 10

SAAC chair is 
dismayed by results 
ContInued from pace 1 
"What thi s means, we don't know. 
We haven' t done studies on it yet. " 

According to Colvin , UCLA 
researched the names of those 
who declined to state their ethnic-
it y through the Educational 
Testing Service (ETS), the organi -
zation responsible for administer-
ing the S.A.T. From the informa-
tion which the ETS co llects on 
S.A.T. registration forms, UCLA 
found that "upwards of 80 per-
cent" of those who declined to 
state were whit e or Asian 
American. 

Colvin also said the box on the 
UC application that asks students 
to state their ethnic identity is not 
as emphasized now as it was in the 
past. Prior to thi s year. the box was 
placed at the top of a page in 
Section 5; now it is located at the 
bottom of a page in Set:tion 14 with 
an advisory statement. 

"There's an advisory statelllern 
saying that the inlilrmation will nO! 
be used in admiss ions, and that it is 
optional." Colvin said . "Thi s may 

have led to students to think 'why 
bother. '" 

According to Co lvin , the UC 
applkation still im:ludes the box 
bet:ause the universit y is required 
to t:o llel:l dat a on the e thni c 
breakdown of student s who appl y 
and are admilled to the uni versity 
for report s to the federal govern-
ment. 

A UCOP press release 
expressed the hope that "the pro-
portion of underrepresented minor-
ity student s in the total pool of 
admit s to the UC system is not 
down as mut:h as earlier t:ampus 
estimates had suggested. 

"At this stage, it is possible that 
when the admiss ions prot:ess is 
completed in May, the number of 
underrepresented minority students 
in the systemwide entering class 
will not show a dramatic drop," the 
release continues. 

Despite this hope, the signifi-
cant drop in the number of under-
represe nted students has generated 
conce rn . 

"We are ex tremely proud of the 
student s admillcd for the UC class 
of 2002," UC President Richard 
Atkinson said Thursday, "hut we 
also view the dec rease in under-
represented student s as a sourt:e

of great com:ern for the univers i-

"We can address thi s in a num-
ber of ways," Atkinson continued. 
"The only rea l answers, however,

K- 12 sc.:hools, in vo lved parents and 
communities that refuse to sellie

Vice Chant:e ll or of Student 
Affa irs Joseph Watson agreed with 
Atkinson on the plan to bellcr K- 12 

education. 
"We need to work on improving 

the education of underrepresented 
students in K-12," Watson said. " It 
is the responsibility of the K- 12 
schools to provide its students with 
a good education." 

According to Students for 
Art'i rmative Ac ti on Committee 
(S AAC) Chair Kathi a Romo, K-
12 outreach isn' t the only so lu -
tio n to t:onfro nting thi s issue. 
Romo said she be li eves the pro b-
lem with K- 12 outreach is that 
many underre presented racial-
minorit y students end up going to 
community t:o lleges because 
they, or the schools that they 
allend , may not have access to 
resources such as S.A.T. prepara-
tion classes and honors classes 
that will prepare them for four-
year universities. 

"Just because these students are 
lacking in support shouldn ' t allow 
them not to go to UC schools," 
Romo said. 

Romo sa id she fee ls that the 
admini stration should imp ro ve 
its methods of outreac h and 
rec ruitment. One suggestion she 
offered was to increase the 
spending on ea(; h applicant for 
rec ruitment.

"UCSD spends $53 per student 
on recruitment. [UC Berkeley J and 
UCLA spend $250. How much 
money is UCSD willing to spend to 
get students here'!" Romo asked . 

Romo also sa id she recom-
mends that the uni versity take more 
responsibility on its own to acti ve-
ly rec ruit students . 

"They come to us and ask us, as 
students, to help them r with rec ruit-
ing!." Romo said, "but the uni ver-
sit y needs to make the effort . They 
say they' re aggressive ly recruiting, 
but they' re pushing it off on the 
students." 

Watson said he di sagreed wi th 
Romo's perception of the newest 
outreach effort s. 

" I personally asked her CO Ill -
millee and others to encourage 
students who apply to att end 
UCSD," Watson said. "I did this 
on the grounds that these students 
are working with the uni vers ity 
and working with faculty and 
administration to make UCSD an 
exce llent c.:ampus. I asked them to 
te ll thesc students to w mc join in

pus. 

" 1 have not asked anyone to take 
on any large or unnecessary 
responsibility," Watson added.

he skateboard has long been a San Diego lix-
ture, making it , first appearance in the area 
way hefore the creation of ' CSD. In recent 
years, skatehoarding has enjoyed a massive 
resurgence in popularity, appearing even hi g-
ger now than it was during (he mid- 19!lOs. 

One result of this popularity is the production of new 
types of skateboards. The most notable is the longboard, 
which is partly a produci of our area's dominant SUIi' cultu re. 

Longhoards arc designed for downhill skatehoarding 
and arc heavier and larger than the conventional , two-tail 
short hoard or 'J ib." designed for trick riding. At UCSD, 
Gravity boards and Sector 9s arc the most commonl y 
seen brands of longhoards - the latter uf which arc huilt 
here in La Jolla . 

"It 's exactly like snowboarding on the street, but even 
beller because you're not strapped in ," s<lid Muir sopho-
more Adam Leising allout carving a hill on a Gravit y. 

Although some peop le like to explore the possibilities 
of other styles, many skaters prefer to sti ck with the tra-
ditional shortboards. 

" I think Iiongboardsl are good if you're going to 
homh a long hill ," Muir sophomore Jon Fattahi said. 
"Otherwise they'n: a pain Occausc they're tuo he<lvy, 
they' re too hard to carry around , lind it's hard to tum 
them rcallJuick unl e~s you're going fast." 

Another result of skateboarlling's burgeoning popu-
larily is an increase in Ihe numher of women - hoth pro-

fcs~ionally and on campus - into the trad itiona lly male-
dominated sport , 

"I've seen some girls thi s year that ac tually looked 
natural anll comfortable and coordinated un a skateboard . 
And that 's cool," Leising said . 

However, the sport has a long way to go before gen-
der equality is achieved. 

" [f you look at the Iskate l magazines, all the advertis-
ing is gea red towards guys, so Igirl s l aren' t part of the 
skateboard industry or cu lture anyway," ohserved one 
female skater. "I'd like to meel more gi rls on campus that 
skate, though." 

Many students skat.e for practica l reasons. UCSD is a 
large campus, and wheeled tranSpurt mechanisms can 
case the commute. 

"If I have. to go to class, it 's a lot cooler to skatc there 
than to ... walk because I get there quicker and I can have 
fun on the way," Revelle junior Josh Susskind sa id. 

Susskind said he views skating as moti vation to attend 
class. He says that skateboards provide a more ponable 
alternative to hicyd es or rollerbladcs - there is no need to 
lock up a skateboard ur wear it into a crowded lecture hall . 

Many argue that hikes and rollerhlades arc "not as 
glamorous" as skateboards, Muir junior Lee Lemay ·aid. 

One reason that skateboarding is especia ll y popular at 
UCSD is the campus it se lf. 

" It 's ki nd of a landmark venu e," Revelle junior Teddy 
Friedri chs sa id. "People come from miles around to skate 
UCSD." 

The campus is a street skater's paradise, providing an 
ample supply of ledges, rails, gaps and staircases per-
fe.:tly suited for 'olli es,' 'g rinds,' 'no 'cslides' or any 
other conceivable skate trick, 

On weekends, camcorder-wielding proskateboarders 
frclJuent the campus, featured in countless skate maga-
lines and videos . It is nOl uncommon to see skaters being 
vidcotaped or photographed at spots by the Social Science 
Building (SSB), thc Price Center, McGill Hall ur the Engi -
nee ring Building, just to name a lew. 

"Therc arc two sides to it ," Napier said , "First of all , 
it 's perfect for skating a jib or longboard ," Napier noted 
the multitude of sloping hills that "were just made to be 
bombed .... But the uther side to it is the campu s police, 
who arc ju ~ t on your ass constantly." 
TIle Ru ... 

According 10 UCSD bicycle cnforcement onicer Mike 
Bradford, there is no skatehoarding allowed on streets, 
parking lots or areas with "no skatelloarding" signs. Th is 
relegates skaters to sume sidewalks and pedcst rian walk-

See SKATE, Page 7

Continued frOID ...... 
ways. Many of these signs were put 
up in response to faculty .:omplaints 
about noisy skatebo.trders. 

Bradford frequents busy walk-
ways, issuing warning~ and ti.:kets 
- starting at $80 - to violators on 
a daily basis. Generally, he said he 
hands out one warning bcflJ re writ-
ing the violator a ti.:ket. However. 
he docs consider the severity of 
each offense. 

"I take every situati on on a case-
by-case basis," Bradford said. "If 
they're doing something ex tremely 
dangerous with lack of regard for 
enforcemem, then the person might 
get a c it ation right off the hat." 

'Bradrord said he is following 
instructions from the San Diego 
Trafli c and Arraignment Court , the 
government agency which sets the 
penalties and ass umes all funds 
from the .: it ations. 

Another reason for all the 
threatening signs is that "skate-
bo,mJcrs havc been pretty notorious 
in de~t royi n g the lands.:ape in cc r-
tain areas with their tricks," Brad-
ford said. 

Bradford citcd the di stinctive 
black scuff marks on walls and 
ledges all over campus left by 
skateboards and street wax used to 
faci litate tricks on concrete, 

The admini stration tries to curb 
cam pus defat: ement by placing 
plastic or metal "speed bumps" on 
.:ert ain rails and ledges, such as the 
stairt:ase in front of Maye r Hall . 

These effort s arc criti cized by 

skateboarders, who see them as an 
unnecessary personal affront. 

"The beauty created by what 
they do on their skateboards more 
than makes up for the damage done 
to the concrete," Muir sophomore 
Adam Leising said. 

Many members of the UCSD 
community applaud the measures. 

" I don ' t think it 's just because 
they hate skateboarders," Marshall 
junior Brooke Lehrer said. "I think 
it's pretty cool watching them, but I 
:ee the point of pUlling Ispeed 
bumps I up , because the wax and 
dark marks don't look very nice." 

Those who work near popular 
skate spots voice particular di scon-
tent over the noise and destruction 
caused by skateboard tricks. 

" I think Ithe skateboarders] 
should patrol themse lves and be a 
little more consciou s of the fact 
that it 's very disturbing," said a 
starf member who works in SSB. 
"On a day like thi s we wouldn ' t be 
ahle to keep our windows open 
because of t he noise, and that's our 
only air co nditioning in here .. ,. 
There larel other places they can 
go." 
A Double Standard? 

Although most of the stated rules 
and posted signs apply to bikes as 
well, skateboarder!> at UCSD leel 
there is an overt llouble standard in 
the enforcement of regulations 
toward skateboarders and bi cyclists, 
accusing officers of being much 
more strict with the former. 

"The RSO's lresidential securi-
ty oflicersj don't want to have to 
worry about how fast they 're go ing, 
and they can cah.: h skateboarders ... 
a lot easier than they can catch bik-
ers, so I think it 's kind of a laz iness

significdllt contribution to UCSD or the community at large. 
The selection criteria for this scholarship include both a

ThiS scholarship has been establ ished through the

thing," Fallahi said about the possi. 
ble reasons behind the perceived 
double standard, 

A common idea is that bicycles 
are safer than skateboards to other 
pedestrians. 

"Some skaters just hau I ass 
down that hill I from Peterson Hall 
to the Geisel Library] - I would 
say that's a lot more dangerous 
than bikes because with bikes, you 
can brake a lot faster," sa id Mar-
shall sophomore Mark Chaisson, a 
member of the UCSD bike club. 

Skateboarders, however, view 
the situation differently. 

"Granted, you have handbrakes 
on bikes, but I sti ll see a lot of bik-
ers out of control," Leising said . "I 
think most skaters are under con-
tro l - if they 're not, they 're going 
to eat it and just hurt themselves." 

The perceived double standard 
may not be based on the dilrerenccs 
between bikes and skateboards, but 
rather, between the people who ride 
them and their respecti ve reputations. 

"They' re harder on skaters 
because of the stigma, although I 
don't know if therc's one on thi s 
campus," Napi l!r sa id . ''There is the 
saying 'skateboa rd ing is not a 
crime' - people who skate tend 10 
be more liberal, I guess you might 
say, than bike riders might he." 

Al:cording to skateboarders, the 
problem is how officers view them. 

''The first thing that goes through 
a \:Op's mind when they sec a skater 
is 'criminal,' 'juvenile: 'druggie: 
'drop-out,'" Leising said. 

Leising related that on one occa-
sion, a police car closely shadowed 
him while skating on the t:ampus 
loop sidewalk . "He was just looking 
for me to do anything wrong."

Police officer Bradlord docs not 
deny the appcaranl:e of a double 
standard. 

"I guess you could say that 
skateboarders are in their own lillie 
world ," Bradford said . "They can't 
see any danger and they do it for 
fun. They have an entirely ditlerent 
memality than that of bicyclists.

The issue of safety and skale-

ilies who palrol UCSD. The topic is 
especiall y relevanl si nce a student 
was killed two years ago while 
skating down the sleep hil l belween 
Peterson Hall and the Geise l 
Lihrary. The death came as a wake-

began my first morning with a 
long walk through Ihe hills and 
back-roads leading away from 
tow n. 

The scenery was, of course, 
beautiful. The grass in thi ' counll·y 
conlinues td amat:e me, ' as il is'11ot -

she knew me. (I say "Yank ," bUI 
evelyonc I spoke with seemed 10 
think I was Canadian - for what -
ever reason . On what basis they 
made thi s distinction, I am nOI 
sure.) This friendliness conlraSIS 
with both an Diego and Cork 
City, where drivers and pedestri -
ans do comparati ve ly more to 
ignore each other and keep Lo 
themse)ves. With tired legs and 
rain clouds overhead, I headed 
back into town in search of some-
thing else to do. After talking with 

a couple of residents, I learned of 
a concert happening that night in 
another little villa ca lled Leap 
(pronounced Lep). 

As bus se rvil,;e was prett y

However, unahle to conquer the

Continued fram ...... 
ulation of skating has become more 
visible bel,;ause of addilional signs

Skateboarders, however, I,;o m-
plain that law enforcement uses the 
tragedy as a weapon. , 

"Security officers always 
exploit [Ihe accident) by saying 
'Some guy died here last year, we 
don ' t want that to happen again ,'" 
Muir sophomore Lori Damiano 
said. "But that guy was going 
down a hill really fast, which is a 
totally different thing than just 
crui sing around and trying tricks 
on a curb." 

Damiano said thai male skate-
boarders are generally supportive 
of her, but campus police harass her 
more than other skateboarders 
because of her gender. 

"It 's a lot harder to be sneaky 
about it," Damiano said. "There 
aren' t that many gi rl s do ing Iricks 
at school, so they know who I am 
and they' re harder on me." 

However, many skateboarders 
complain Ihat orticers harass them 
lilr more frequentl y I han anyone else.

"We're nOI really hurting any-

In any case, there exists a defi -
nite tension between adminislrators 
and the culture surrounding the 
skatehoard . 

"It 's just kind of a si lenl , cold

Due to skalchoarding 's renai s-

ers of skatehoard equipment and 
clothing now make more money 
than ever, which wn lribules 10 the 
mainslrcaming of skaling. 

The ESPN X-Galllc~, held in San 
Diego last ~uml1l e r, featured skale-

boarding a.~ a main event. Several 
old-school skateboarders said they 
harbor a sense of fruslralion and 
resentment towards cel1ain skaters 
whom they feel have diluted what 
was once a ti ght-knit communily. 

"You would go into a skate 
shop, and they would hook you 
up," Fattahi reminisced no talgical-
Iy. "They'd have prices that were 
advertised, and Ihen prices for peo-
ple who came in all the time." 

Fattahi said thai nowadays a 
decenl new skateboard costs over 
$100, more than a 30-pen;ent 
increase from just a few years ago. 

"It's just getting out of hand," he 
said. 

Issues of new and old aside, it 
would be a mistake to group all 
skaters into one, homogeneous 
group. Differences exist between 
bicyc li sts and skaters, but also 
among skateboarders. 

'There 's a lot of people around 
here who don 't undersland, and 
skate for all the wrong reasons," 
said Fallahi , ci ting the "jocks-on-
wheels" who have cropped up in 
recent years. 'They don'l do it for 
an indi vi dual rush, Ihey do il just 
cause thcy think it looks cool or 
cause they think they can get to 
class faster so they ' ll have more 
time 10 st udy." 

Olhe r~ do not seem as con-
cerned wi lh the individual on Ihe 
deck. 

"As long as people arc having 
fun outside ,kaling and all. it \

simply not the case in Leap. The 
conversation paused as I walked 
in, and the live older men drink-
ing pints of Guinness turned to 
stare at me. Fortunately, a friend-
ly, younger man working behind 
the har chatted with me as I ate. 
When I later met up with him at 
the conl,;erl, he told me that, as I 
left, everyone at the pub turned 
around and watched me leave. 

"They pretend like they don' t 
care, but they're really nosy," he 
told me. Visitors, such as myself, 
stand out like a sore thumb and 
arc Ihe subject of mUI,;h curiosity. 

It is now a Sunday afternoon, 
and I write this from anolher put 
in Skibbereen. The Irish pub is not 
simply a bar, but a social cenler, 
with an enlire culture associated 
with it. Groups of young and o ld 
men si t around, lalking and drink-
ing their pints, bUI families also 
come into Ihe pub. The children 
entertain themselves, the older 
ones with darts and Ihe you.nger 
ones by allel11pting to climb the 
seemingly mountainous barstools, 
while Ihe adulls converse.

had seen in bigger cities ( uch as 
Dublin) and areas with more 
touri st attractions. Country life dif-
fers from city life, which, in tum, 
differs from student life. It 
requires a bit of exploring in seem-
ingly unlikely places to really get a 
sense of the different dimensions. 

Friends expressed surpri se 
upon my return when I told Ihem 
that I had gone by my self. 
"Weren' t you sl,;aredT' they

traveling alone inherently con-
tains more risks, lean 't let that 
quell my sense of adventure, nor 
can it hold me bal,;k from experi-
encing new aspects of Irish cul-
ture. In the case of my Skib-
bereen trip, trave ling solo proved 
to be a great adventure. Precisely 
because I was alone, I went oul 
of my way to meet new people.

OPINION II 



12 OPINION 

JoeLe\mthai 
Choosing a presidential candi-

date from a pool of three might 
ordinarily be a diftkuh task -
especia lly when all three candi-
dates exhibit strong qualifkations 
and ski lls indicating the ability to 
Icad the student hody well. 

In this case, however, one can-
didate embodies the spirit of lead-
ershi p necessary to earn ou r 
endorsement more than any other. 
Joc Leventhal is the candidate for 
A.S. president that UCSD has been 
waiting for. 

By running independent of a 
slate, Leventhal demonstrates a 
confidence in his ideas and a ten-
dency to be concerned with issues 

TeshKllullar 
Tesh Khullar, a member of the 

"Millennium" slate, has extensive 
A.S. experience. He served as the 
commissioner of student advocacy 
this year and as Warren freshman 
and sophomore senators. 

As president, he plans to start 
an A.S .-sponsored high school 
conference focusing on outreach 
to socioeconomically disadvan-
taged students. He would also 
advocate for increased funding for 
student services such as O.A.S.I.S. 
and the Women 's Center. 

Khullar ~ould also start a Safe 
Rides program, under which stu-
dents could call a cab and the first 

rather than allying himself with a 
slate and a platform full of compro-
mises. He feels that not being on a 
slate makes him more approach-
ahle because he is open to so many 
new ideas, and he feels that his 
independence generates a mutual 
respect among the slates. 

Leventhal has been involved in 
numerous activities throughout hi s 
UCSD career, from the cross coun-
try team to managing A.S. Lecture 
Notes. Most notable among his 
ac hievements are his positions as 
chair of the University Centers 
Advisory Board and executive 
advocate to former AS. President 
Coleen Sabatini. 

We were impressed by many 
things Leventhal told us in his inter-
view, some relating to new ideas, 
some actions that he has taken in 
anticipation of bei ng elected. 
Admirably, he believes that it would 
save enormous resources to combine 
the AS. Lecture Notes and AS. Soft 
Reserves services. He also believes 
that an agreement could be made 
between AS. Lecture Notes and the 
Office for Students with Disabilities 
(OSO) under which note subscrip-
tions would be complimentary to 
students registered with OSD. 

Another noble idea, which was 
mentioned by several other candi-
dates as well, is a Safe Rides pro-

live miles would be charged to the 
A.S. He also strongly supports the 
move to Division II, as he says it 
will increase sehool spirit - a pri-
ority of his. 

Khullar would also start a Presi-
dents Forum. a meeti ng between all 
the leaders of student organizations 
and the A.S. president. It would 
increase student input in the deci-
sions of the AS. Council. 

Khullar S4PportS the AS. activi-
ty-fee increase because it would 
provide greater funding to student 
organizations. Although he feels the 
Academic Success Program is an 
excellent idea. he is opposed to the 
referendum because of the organi7..a-
tion's lack of planning.

gram. This would enable students 
who have been drinking at parties to 
get home safely and cheaply. This 
program could be subsidized by the 
A.S., and students using the service 
would pay only a nominal fee. Lev-
enthal will endorse thi s pro-
gram no matter the fate of 
the A.S. activity fee 
because he believes 
this program is invalu-
ab le and, "that's

In order to maintain open lines 
of communications and to harvest 
input of student concerns, Leven-
thal would like to end out ali-cam-
pus e-mails to students to inform 
them of what he, and the rest of the 
A.S., are doing and what issues 
they are working on.

Leventhal seems to take on a lot 
of authority because he likes 10 do 
the work. However, the load of the 
A.S. president is a heavy one to bear, 
and we hope that in all of his eager-
ness he remembers to delegate tasks 
to people he feels can do the job, 
leaving him free to tackle new issues. be worth all 

the money." 
Leventhal's 

ideas for financial restructur-
ing the AS. are remarkable as well. 
After calculating two possible bud-
gets for next year - one for if the 
fee increase passes and one for if it 
doesn' t - he started looking at 
ways to save the A.S. money that 
may have previously been over-
looked. He is interested in pro-
gramming events that cater to 
groups other than undergraduates, 
so that funding can be pooled from 
multiple organizations, thus lifting 
the financial burden on the A.S. 
Also, Leventhal intends to research 
and assemble a resource guide for 
student organizations to help them 
ensure they get the besl deals on

has two previous years' experience 
with the council and she served on 
the K-12 Outreach Task Force that 
conceived C.R.E.AT.E. and the

Respectably, he was 

happy to candidly tell us 
lhat thi s is not his own idea, but that 
it is a likely recommendation of the 
Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges - a group at whose cam-
pus meeting he was the only student 
representative in attendance. 

The Guardian is concerned with 
candidates' experiences with and 
attitudes toward multicultural 
events. Leventhal is a Thurgood 
Marshall student who has worked 
on the Thurgood Marshall College 
Council , participated in diversity 
workshops, attended Affirmative 
Action Retention Committee meet-
ings and helped to program events 
that eller towards students of color. 

O.A.S.I.S., Ihe Women's Center 
and the Cross Cultural Center. 
However, she does not support the 
proposed $6.50 A.S. activity-fee 
increase and said she would rather 
reallocate money to needy pro-
grams and organizations. 

Mansury said she is concerned 
with the A.S. Council's lack of 
accountability, and lhat inereasing 
the council 's budget by nearly 
S300,()()() per year could be danger-
ous. 

Mansury supports the Academic 
Success Program referendum, 
which would fund a textbook-lend-
ing program and an exam archive, 
as well as peer mentoring and tutor-
ing programs. 

As an athlete, Leventhal is partic-
ularly concerned with school spirit 
and the gnawing apathy that plagues 
UCSD. One part of hi s solution to 
this problem is to establish a new 
position on council - a commis-
sioner of athletics. This would open 
up representation to a very large 
group of students, bring dillerent 
ideas to council and hopefully 
encourage more participation in ath-
letic events by the student body. 

The Guardiall overwhelmingly 
supports Joe Leventhal for AS. pres-
ident. He has a remarkable history of 
activity at UCSD, shows sincere 
concern for the state of affairs here 
and the climate of student lite. He 
would definitely be an asset, both to 
the council and to the student body.

Monday, April 6, 1998 

VicePresidentlnternal 
The candidates for vice pres-

ident internal are Penni Takade, 
a member of the "Millennium" 
slate. and Kim McKoon, a 
member of the "Students First I" 
slate. Both are well qualified to 
till the position. 

McKoon, who is serving as 
Marshall sophomore senator, 
has a lot of experience worki ng 
with several st udent organiza-

KimMcKoon tions and seems deJicated to 
assisting as many groups as pos-

sible. He is voca l, knowledgeable and has mallY great ideas 
such as promoting counci l accountability and st rengthen-
ing the relationship netween A.S. Counc il and the co llege 
counci ls. 

Takade has experi em:e working in current Vice 
President Internal Oavid Fill.gerald 's officc. She is current -
ly servi ng as parliamentarian to the A.S. Council - a job 
that requires attention to detail and knowledge of the A.S. 
rules and procedures. Takade is polished, well-prepared 
and has some new ideas. 

When all of the factors are considered, both candidates 
have the courage and conviction to serve. However, we 
have decided to endorse McKoon because he seems to be 
willing to give more of himself to the office. McKoon 
appears to he the type of candidate who will never stop 
thinking about how he can better serve UCSD students. He 
seems genuinely committed to finding solutions for any 
and all problems students might have. 

However, if McKoon is elected. we hope that he runs 
the AS. council with a fair and unbiased hand. We urge 
him not to yield his chair easily to hold a discussion -
rather that he holds discussions before and after meetings. 

In addition, McKoon advocates starting an AS. watch-
dog organization. We hope that. if elected, he turns over the 
project to someone who is not affiliated with the eouncil. 

In addition, the vice president internal needs to ensure 
that appointees to the multitude of campus committees 
report back to the A.S. Council. A revival of the senator 
tasks should be a high priority because of the potential 
good that may come out of these projects. 

Because we feel that contact with the students is impor-
tant, the Guardian endorses McKoon for the posi tion of 
vice president internal.

TheReferenda 
FeeReferendumOne I Yes 

If passed, the fi rst fee referen-
dum would augment the current 
$13.50 AS. activity fee by $6.50. 
This fee pays for the activities and 
services that the AS sponsors, such 
as student organization funding, Ihe 
Sun God Festival, TGs, campus 
alternative media and numerous 
other programs. 

Increasing the Campus ActivilY 
Fee is an action that is much need-
ed and long overdue. The last fee 
increase took place in 1985, and in 
the past 13 years, the value of the 
$13.50 has decreased to $7 due to 
inflation. Consequently, the 

resources available to the AS . to 
provide Ihe aforementioned ser-
vices have substanlially declined. 

Since the last increase, requests 
for money from the 275 student 
organizations on campus have great-
ly surpassed the finam:ial resoun:es 
available to the AS. As a result, not 
all sludent organizations are gelling 
the funding Ihey may need. 

Programming costs have 
increased significantly in recent 
years. The Sun God Festival is one 
of the mosl imponant events on the 
campus and, in the coming years, the 
A.S. must he able to have the

Most imponantly, if the A.S.

18 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, April 6, 1998 ~~~------------~------------------------------------------------~--------

SUN GOD FEsTIVAL MIGHT BE CUT WITHOUT fEE' INCREASE 
Editor: 

Sun God Festival. Student 
Organizations. Winterfesl. College 
Councils. ASIO. Nooners. 
Alternative Media. TG's. And the 
list goes on and on. 

Every quarter each UCSD stu-
dent pays $ 13.50 to provide ser-
vices and represent students at 
UCSD through the Associated 
Students. These events and services 
thai the A.S. provides arc an inte-
gral parl of student Ii fe on campus. 
However, students ri sk losing their 
services without an appropriale 
nominal increase in the campus 
activity fee to maintain and expand 
these services. 

The last time ASUCSD saw an 
increase in the activity fee was J 3 
years ago, in 1985. Si nce then the 
value of the current $ 13.50 activity 
fee has decreased a lotal of $7 as a 
result of increasing costs and infla-
tion. The proposed $6.50 illl:rease 
will hring AS. fundin g leve ls 
approximately to 19l!5 Icve ls. 
Without thi s increase. inflation will 
continue to Cal away at funding for 
student activities. programming and 
funding of student organizations. 

UCSD has the second-lowest 
campus ac.:livity fee in the UC sys-
tem. As a result . students are over-
whelmingly unhappy with the qual -
ity of life at UCSD as measured by 
the campus climate survey held last 
spring. 

The survey committee recom-
mendCd an im:rcasc in the 
ASUCSD activi ty fcc to enhance 
the out -or-classroom e~pe ricm;e 
for students. Student s e lected hy 
you wi II make all decisions regard-

ing allocation of these increased 
dollars. The A.S . Council, whose 
members are voted into office by 
students, will continue to allocate 
all campus activity funds per your 
needs. 

This increase in funding will 
support bigger, better, and more 
diversified programming. SlUdents 
deserve a better Winterfest and a 
higger Sun God Festival. In addi -
ti on, plans arc in the works to 
develop a fall fe~ ti val held on 
homecoming weekend in Oelober 
that would be equivalent to the Sun 
God Festival. 

II wi ll be impossihle to deve lop 
a new festi va l and augment the 
exis ting programs without the 
increase. In fact, without the 
increase it is possible that funding 
for the Su n God Festi va l will be cut 
and Winterfest wi ll be ~ance l ed . 

Let me emphasize that agai n: 
wilhout an increase to offset 
in~reased programming cost ~ it is 
en tirely poss ible that Sun God 
Funding will be cut and 
Winterrest will be canceled! 

This increase is necessary to 
provide ror the greater demand by 
students for programming on thi s 
campus. In addi tion, ASUCSD will 
no longer be able to provide quali-
ty TG 's like Third Eye Blind, 
Xzihit , Royal Crown Revue and 
Buck-O-Nine. In other words, ir 
you want higger. beller and more 
diversified programming, Ihi s fcc 
increase must pa~s .

de nt organil.ati ons fal t.:xceeded 
avai lahle funds. The 

ac ti vi ti es/event ~/progra lm. spon -
~o red hy student organizations 
wou ld he e nha n~ed by thi s $6.50 
Icc increase. 

As Illt.:ntioned hefore, wi thout 
thi s appropriate increase, funding 
may be cut to ~tudent organizations 
and services may be slashed. The 
student demand ror funding or stu-
dent organi zations has dramatica ll y 
increased since IlJl!5 and the A.S. 
Council has rt.:sponded. 

Increas ing the funding will pro-
vide more Illoney for studen t orga-
nil.ation prog ramming, thus 
improving th t.: qualit y of life on 

campus. Again , without the 
increase, student organizat ions risk 
losi ng funding from the A.S. 

College funding will also 
increase if the activity fee passes. 
The primary source of funding for 
all co llege counci Is arc funds allo-
ca ted from the Associated 
Students. If the fee increase passes, 
the AS. Council will allocate more 
funds 10 the co ll ege council s for 
co llege-specific programming, ser-
vices and events. Over the past 
year, co ll ege demands on A.S. 
funds have increased ancl the A.S. 
should respond with more money 
- this cannot happen wi thout a Ice 
im.:rease. 

Funding of recreation clubs on 
campus wou ld improve as well. 
Thi s past A.S. administration has 
taken a proacti ve stance on helping 
fund rec duhs at UCSD. These 
duhs arc severl y underfunded, but 
the A.S. will he able to support 
them more adequately with the 

increa~e. Just like all ~tudent urga-
nizati ons on campus, the rec cluhs 
der~erve fair and impartial funding. 
If thi s fcc passes, they, along wi th 
the ot her student urgs, will ret:ei ve 
huge increases in funding to help 
program and provide a beller qual-
ity of life at UCSD. 

Arguments aga inst the fee 
increase arc frequently hased on 
lies and misinformation. 

One argument claims that this 
increase is too large. Examining 
what this increase will fund and 
how slight the increase per student 
is inva lidates thi s poo rl y construct-
ed argument. 

Ot hers daim that the A.S. 

should betler manage the money it 
already has. I believe that this AS . 
has made dramatic improvements 
over previous years and will con-
tinue to protect student money. 
Those who argue about better man-
agement usually question why the 
A.S. funds particular event s or 
organ izations. 

With an increase in the fee , the 
Associated SlUdents wi II be ahle 10 
spread more funds to a variety of 
events and programs to make all 
students excited to be at UCSD. 

In li ght of the 5 percent fee roll-
back for the upcom ing academit: 
year, student s will have more money 
rrom their Ii nancial aid disburse-
ments to spend on books and 
extracurri cul ar activities. In addi -
ti on, because thi s is a mandatory fcc, 
it wi ll be covered by finan cial aid. 

This is a large campus with a 
small -campu s mentality. We need 
to move heyond th,\I and prepare 
for the growi ng cosl and increasing 
student demands on th e A.S. 
Simp ly put, the $6.50 increase is 
equi va lent to five cups of cuffee 
per quarter. I beli eve that it is a 
slll ali sacrifice to make for a helter 
student li fe. 

Without this int:reasc. program -
ming will eventuall y be cut , Sun 
God cance led , student organizati on 
funding dec reased, Student Cable 
Wo rks (KSDT & SRTV) shut 
down , no alternati ve media produc-
tion, and the AS . will no longer 
cxist to serve student s, to represe nt 
students and to make UCSD a bet-
ter place.

"I think it's something 10 be

UCSD's fini sh. " It 's a heart -break-

and it shows our potenti al." 

Fur the wOlllen. it was not quit e

18 OPINION The UCSO Guardian Monday, April 6, 1998 

SUN GOD FEsTIVAL MIGHT BE CUT WITHOUT fEE' INCREASE 
Editor: 

Sun God Festi val. Student 
Organizations. Winterfesl. College 
Councils. ASIO. Nooners. 
Alternative Media. TG's. And the 
li st goes on and on. 

Every quarter each UCSO stu-
dent pays $ I 3.50 to prov ide ser-
vices and represent student s at 
UCSD through the Assoc iated 
Students. These event s and services 
that the A.S. provides are an inte-
gral part of student Ii fe on campus. 
However, student s ri sk losing their 
services wi thout an appropriate 
nominal increase in the campus 
activity fee to maintai n and ex pand 
these services. 

The last time ASUCSD saw an 
increase in the acti vity fee was 13 
years ago, in 19R5. Si nce then the 
value of the current $ I 3.50 acti vity 
fee has decreased a total of $7 as a 
result of increasing costs and infla-
tion. The proposed $6.50 innease 
will bri ng A.S. funding leve ls 
approx imately to I Yll5 leve ls. 
Without th is increase, inflation wi ll 
continue to eat away at funding ~ r 
student activ ities, programming and 
funding of student orga ni zations. 

UCSD has the second-lowest 
campus acti vit y fee in the UC sys-
tem. As a result , students are over-
whelmingly unhappy with the qual -
ity of life at UCSD as measured by 
the campus cli mate survey held last 
spring. 

The survey commillee recom-
mended an increase in the 
ASUCSD activi ty fee to enhance 
the out-of-c lassroom ex perience 
for studenls. Student s e lected hy 
you will make all decis ions regard-

ing allocation of these increased 
dollars. The A.S. Council, whose 
members are voted into office hy 
students, will continue to allocate 
all campus activity funds per your 
needs. 

This increasc in funding will 
support bi gger, beller, and more 
diversified programming. Students 
deserve a beller Winterfest and a 
hi gger Sun God Festi val. In addi -
tion, plans are in the works to 
develop a fall fes tiva l held on 
homecoming weekend in October 
th at would be equi valent to the Sun 
God Festi va l. 

It will be imposs ihle to deve lop 
a new festi va l and augment the 
ex isting programs wi thout the 
increase. In fac t, without the 
increase it is possible that fund ing 
fo r the Sun God Festi val will be cut 
and Winterfest wi ll he cance led. 

Let me emphasize th at aga in: 
wi thout an increase to offse t 
increased programmi ng costs it is 
entirely possib le that Sun God 
Funding will be cut and 
Winterfcsl will be canceled l 

This increase is necessary to 
provide for the greater demand by 
students for progranuning on thi s 
ca mpus. In addition, ASUCS D will 
no longer be able to provide quali -
ty TG's li ke Third Eye Blind, 
Xz ihit , Royal Crown Revue and 
Buck-O-Nine. In other words, if 
you wa nt higger, beller and more 
dive rsified progra mming, this fee 
i ncre'lse lIIust 1'''''' 

The campu s aClJ vll y fec 
increase· will support all st udent 
organilati ons. The 1997-n

dent organi/ations fa l .:xc.:cded 
avai lahle funds. The 
aeli vi ties/e vents/program, spon -
sored hy , Iuuent organi za ti ons 
would he enhanced by th is $n.50 
fee increase. 

As mentioned hefore, without 
this appropriate increase, funding 
may be cut to student organizati ons 
and services may be slashed. The 
student demand for funding of stu-
dent organi zations has dramaticall y 
increased since 1985 and the AS. 
Counci l has rcsponded. 

Im;reasi ng the fund ing will pro-
vide more money for ,tuden t orga-
niza tion programrning, thus 
illiprovi ng Ih e quali ty of life on 

campus. Again, without the 
increase, student orga niza ti ons risk 
losing fundin g from the AS . 

College funding will a lso 
increase if the activity fee passes. 
The primary source of funding for 
all co llege counci Is are funds allo-
ca ted from the Assoc iated 
Students. If the fee increase passes, 
the A.S. Council will all ocate more 
funds to the co llege coum:il s for 
college-specifi c programming, ser-
vices and events. Over the past 
year, college dc mands on A.S. 
funds have im:reased and the A.S. 
shou ld respond with mo rc mo ney 
- this cannot happen without a Ice 
increase. 

Funding of recreati on dubs on 
campus would improve as well. 
T his pa ·t A.S. administration has 
taken a proacti ve stance on helping 
fund rec c lu bs at UCSD. These 
cluhs are severly underfunded, but 
the A.S. will be able to support 
them more adequatcly wit h the 
increase. Just like al l , tudem orga-
niLa tions on campus, the rec c lu hs 
derserve fair and impartia l fund ing. 
I f this fee passes, they, along with 
the other student orgs, wi ll receive 
huge increases in fun ding to help 
program and provide a beller qu al-
ity of life at UCSD. 

Arguments aga inst th e fee 
increase are frequently hased on 
lies and mis information. 

One argument d aims that thi s 
increase is too large. Exami ni ng 
what th is increase wi ll fund and 
how sli ght the increase per student 
is inva li dates this poo rl y construct-
ed argu rnent . 

Others da im that the A.S. 

should better manage the money it 
already has. I believe that thi s AS. 
has made dramati c improvements 
o ller prev ious years and will con-
tinue to protect student money. 
Those who argue about better man-
agement usuall y question why the 
A.S . funds particul ar event s or 
organizations. 

With an increase in the fee, the 
Associated Student s will be ahle to 
spread more funds to a varict y of 
events and programs to make all 
students exci ted to be at UCSO. 

In light of the 5 percent fee roll-
hack for the upcoming academic 
year, students will have more money 
from their financial aid di sburse-
ments to spend on books and 
extracurricular acti vities. In addi -
tion, hecause thi s is a mandatory fee, 
it will be covered by financial aid. 

T his is a large campus with a 
small -campus mentality. We neeu 
to move heyond that and prepare 
for the growing cost and increasing 
student demands on the A.S. 
Si mply put , the $6.50 increase is 
equi valent to Ii ve cups of coffee 
per quarter. I believe th at it is a 
small sacri fi ce to make for a hetter 
student life. 

Without this increase, program-
ming will e llentua lly be cut, Sun 
God canceled, student organi zation 
funding dec reased, Student Cable 
Work s (KSDT & SRTV) shut 
down, no alternati ve medi a produc-
tion, and the A.S. will no longer 
ex ist to serve students, to represen t 
student s and to make UCS D a het-
ICr place.

Cal Cup , the closest fini sh to date 
being a second-place three years

competiti on in the Cal Cup was 
prett y meager: today, a number of 
Divis ion I schools entered the Cal 
Cup with hopes of neXI year racing 
in the Copley. 

UCSD's hest e ight mcn would

bigger, stronger boal. The last cou-

power through them." 

"I think it 's something to be 
proud of," junior Wayne Liu said of 
UCSO's fini sh. " It 's a heart -break-
ing loss, but it shows where we are 
and it shows our potenti al." 

For the womcn, it was not quitc 
such a brcakthrough weekend. 

"We had really sti ff competi-
tion," varsi ty caplai n Adriane Wes-
se ls said. 'To look at who heal us , 
it's und,;rstandablc. Wc were morc 
here to race a good race than til

Amazing Ninth-Inning Heroics Save UCSD 
CLUTCH: The Tritons were down 9-2 in the seventh, but came back in remarkable fashion , including 2 runs in the ninth inning 
By John Maynard 
Staff Wmer 

Do not wake the ~ Ieeping giant, 
or you will suffer his wrath . 

While the UCSD haseball leam 
i\n ' t necessarily a behemotht it 
docs have major pOlenlial lhal has-
n' t quite been fu llilled th is season. 

When UCSO last faced Ca lifor-
nia Baplist College ba~k in Febru-
ary, the Tritons were defeated, 21-
8. 

By the way Saturday's game 
was going, Triton fans were fearing 
another slashing from the Lan~ers. 
Then the slumbering Tritons 
awoke. 

UCSD showed some of the 
character development thal Head 
Coach Dan O' Brien has been talk -
ing about all season, as it pulled ofr 
an incredib le 10-9 I.:ome-from-
behind win in the hottom of Ihe 
ninth. 

Down by 7 runs goi ng into the 
bottom of the seventh , the Tritons 
slaged a rally that chipped 6 run~ 
off the Lancers ' 9-2 lead. 

Dave In the hottom of the ninth, the 
Tritons fi nished off thei r remark-
able comeback, sque(lking by the 
Lancers, 10-9. It was UCSD 's sec-
ond late- inning comehack in a row, 
improving the hardballers '

record to 9-13. 
On Saturday, the Tri -
ton~ took a 2-2 ball game 
into the top of the fourth. 
All was going well. 

Un fortunatel y, things 
got a hit oul of hand. The 
Lancers loaded t he ha ~e~ , 
and wi th olle whack 10

The Tritolls wcre unab le to get 
hal:k on the board for thl! n 'x t three 

innin g~ , and during thi ~ drought, 
the Lanl: ~ r~ managed to bring 

another three men across 
the plate. By the hOllom of 
the sixth , the Tritons were 
faci ng a 7-rlIn deficit , 9-2. 

During the seventh-
inning stretch, O' Bricn 
huddled up hi s crew, and 
rcminded the Tritons of 
thl!ir ~.tratcgy : to take the 
game inning by inning. 

" Dan rellllndcd u ~ to focus on 
onc Innmg at a time." Ma~on said. 
" Our goal is to w in each inning and 
notll'orry about the defk it." 

This talk proveu to bc bcncfi l:ia l

Leopards Get Peppered 
STRAIGHT SETS: UCSD scored a big breakthrough with its second win 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

LA VERNE - On Friday ni ght , 
the UCSD men's volleyball team 
traveled to the unfriendly con lines 
of the University of La Verne to 
play its most important match of 
the season. 

The No. 4-ranked Tritons chose 
the perfect time to play their hest 
match of the year, as they swept the 
No. 3-ranked Leopards in three 
games. 

for as well as CSD played in 
the Barnum-and-Bai Icy tent that La 
Verne claims is a gym. the Tritons 
need to give an ass ist to the 
women's volleyhall team, which 
bauled heavy rains and traflic to 
provide a criti cal . emotional spark . 

Costumed as nerds and with the 
UCSD flag and thi s sport swriter in 
tow, the women 's team arri ved just 
in time, as the Tritons trailed the 
Loepards, 13-7, in game one and 
appeared to be slumping. 

/\s the women's ~quad hurst into 
CS D cheers, the Tritons suddenly 

came ali ve on the court. 
Riding the wave of emoti on, the 

squad began to score points in 
hunches while the Leopards 
remained locked at 13. Middle 
hlockers Guy Mount and Devon 
JeITcoat were suddenl y gelling a 
hand on every La Verne allack and 
the Triton hillers - led by Ryan 
Woods, Jon Yarri s and Zack Hite -
were nearly flawless. 

"The women's team showing up 
was huge." Yarri ' said. " It see med 
to stea l the horne-court advantage 
away from La Verne. I think that it 
rea lly broke their hack." 

Sensing the game sl ippi ng 
away, the La Verne hench called a 
timeou t in an allempt to stop the 
bleeding. The Trit()n~, however, 
were not ahoUl to be slowed, as 
they . knolled the ~core at 13- 13. 
Wi th the ~core tied , it wa~ 
clear who the con lident 
team on the 1100r was. and 

SD promptly fo ll owed 
by slamming the door shut 
on game one, 15-13. 

With the women's 
squad continu ing it s 
relentl ess chee ring, the 
Tritons held the momen-
tum as the teams switched sides. 
Emotions continued to run high as 
the referee issued a warning to the 
La Verne pl ayer~ for taunt ing. Th is 
onl y seemed to prov id more fu el 
to the UCSD lire. 

The Triton fro ntline cont inued 
to dominate in the second game. 
Woods and seller Kurt Seck ington 
joined Mount and Jeffcoat on the 
hlock hrigade and allowed the Tri-

t o n ~ to jum p out of the blocks to 
gain the ea rl y lead. 

A series of substitutions and 
timeouts hy the Leopards could not 
put a stop to the UCS D ex press that 
was barrelling towards a second-
game Win . 

Tough servi ng by the Tritons 
kept La Verne on its heels and 
allowed UCSD to get a number of 
eas point opportuniti es when the 
Leopards could not set up an offen-
sive allack. 

Hite: a freshman, continued to 
show enormous potential as a hit -
ter, as he pounded olT the La Verne 
hlock for a pair of crucial sideouts. 

"Zack stepped up for us and got 
some important kills," Yarris sa id. 
"For our middles, I think that thi s 
was their best game of the year and 
overall , I think that we served and 
passed better than they did. and that

is what it always <.:ames down to." 
Je ff<.:oat continued to loom large 

in the middle by converting a num-
ber of quick sets from Seckington. 
In add it ion to he ing a part of II 
blocks by the Tritons. Jeffcoat 
stepped up his ou tput on the offen-
sive end by ta ll ying I I kills .

ued to steamroll La Verne in the

second game. While 
UCSD excelled, nothing 
~eemed to be working for 
the Leopards, who record-
ed mo re errors than ki lls in 
the game. 

The Tritons d osed out 
game two, 15-9, wit h the 
women's team still cheer-
ing loudly from the side-

SD continued to apply the 
pressure at the start of game three 
with Woods and Yarris leading the 
offense. The two seniors both 
recorded 13 kills for the match to 
lead the Tri tons. ot wanting to be 
left out or the ac ti on. Seckington 
notched a pair of import ant ki lb 
and a ~e rvice ace in addit ion to hi~ 
43 ass ists. 

With the ci rcus tent gym echo-
ing to the chants of " CS D" from 
the raucous women's vo lleyball 
team , the Tritons easily clmed out 
the match in impressive fa~ hi () n . 
15-9. 

"These nex t three matches arc 
the last of my career and we talked 
about how we wanted to linish
