A.S. Council Votes to 
Close Assorted Vinyl 
LOSSES: Student-run music 
store to close in June after 
losing $56,000 over two years 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

The Assorted Vinyl record store will close 
its doors at the end of this school year due to 
significant financial losses. The Associated 
Students (A.S.) Council approved the clo-
sure last night by an overwhelming majority. 

A.S. President Naomi Falk said Assorted 
Vinyl lost $14,000 last year and $42,000 this 
year. 

"We're losing too much money to main-
tain [Assorted Vinyl)," Falk said. "We need 
to close it down and sell out the inventory to 
make up as much of the $42,000 as possible." 

Former Commissioner of Operations and 
Services Wally Lockwood said he was sorry 
to see the store close. 

"Assorted Vinyl was a last bastion of 
hope, as the last student run CD-store on a 
major university campus," Lockwood said. 
"It lost a great deal of money, but until it had, 
we felt the best thing to do was give ita shot." 

Other council members said they would 
not miss Assorted Vinyl's passing.

UC Provost 
Walter Massey 
Leaves for 
Morehouse Post 
RESIGNADON: Massey takes 
Morehouse presidency; search for 
new UC president begins 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Senior Staff Writer 

. Walter E. Massey, UC provost and senior vice-
president of academic affairs, has been appointed 
president of his alma mater, Morehouse College in 
Atlanta, GA. 

Massey 's decision to leave his post in the UC 
system comes just two years after he was appointed • 
provost. 

Outgoing UC President Jack Peltason will consult 
with the chairman of the UC Board of Regents about 
recruiting a replacement to fill the position opened by 
Massey 's departure. Peltason's successor will make 
the final decision regarding the new provost. 

According to Massey, the decision to leave the UC 
system was not an easy one. 

"My wife and I gave this matter a great deal of 
consideration," he said. "Based upon my personal 
commitment to Morehouse and the opportunity to 
playa significant role in its future, it is the right choice 
for us." 

Citing Massey's skill at leading the UC system 
through its "worst budget crisis since the Great 
Depression," Peltason called Massey a"dynamic 
leader" and a "forceful advocate for higher educa-
tion." 

Glenn Magpantay, executive director of the U ni-
versity of California Student Association (UCSA), 
agreed with Peltason. 

"I'm really excited about his new position at 
Morehouse," said Magpantay. "I am excited for the 
black community." 

Reflecting on Massey's time as provost, 
Magpantay had mixed sentiments. 

"We found an ally in him when we needed to 
develop campus housing - but he wasn't as great 
as we wanted when it came to fee hikes." 

Massey helped the University of California make 
the difficult decision to raise student fees several 
years ago in an effort to offset the lost revenue from 
the state-budget cuts. 

Before becoming UC provost in April of 1993, 
Massey served as the director of the National Sci-
ence Foundation, a post to which he was appointed 
in 1991 by former President George Bush.

Four members of the Associa-
tion of Student Employees/United 
Auto Workers (ASE/UAW) union 
presented a petition for union rcc-
ognition yesterday morning to Vice 
Chancellor of Research/Dean of 
Graduate Studies Richard Attiyeh. 

As many as nine union members 
arrived to tape up copies of the peti-

tion at the chancellor's complex. 
Chancellor Atkinson was off-cam-
pus for the day, so union members 
presented the petitions to Attiyeh. 

Writing slogans like, "ASE will 
never die" and "ASE never gives 
up," on the sidewalk, they drew at-
tention from numerous onlookers. 

Several staff members stopped 
to read the petitions, and at least one 
person signed a copy which was 
taped to the ground. 

"[Today's petition] is part of a 
much larger strategy," said union-
organizer Dan Johnston. 

"We're going to make it so they 

have to recognize us," he said. 
"We're going to make [administra-
tors'] lives so uncomfortable that 
they're not going to have a choice." 

Only professors and staff are 
currently represented under the

Solar Wind May Hold 
Clues to the Past 
CONNEcnGN: UCSD scientists have found a 
correlation between solar wind and lunar rocks 
ByRebeca .... 

St.ffW~r 
Researchen at UCSD believe 

they have found a unique way to 
study the last million years of his-
tory. The tool of their trade -the 
device which allows them to look 
back in time - is something com-
mon to laypersons 
and scientists alike: 
the sun. 

"There is no explanation for this 
change, which is consistent with 
what we k~w about the sun and its 
evolution and structure," said 
Kerridge. 

However, the correlation be-
tween the oscillating nitrogen-iso-
tope levels on the moon's surface 

and the composition 
of the solar wind is 
one which the sci-
entists believe can 
be used to help study 
the sun's history. 

Visiting Chern is-
try Researcher John 
Kerridge and Chem-
istry Professor Kurt 
Marti believe they 
can correlate the so-
lar wind to nitrogen 
levels in the moon's 
rocks, which could 
lead to a theory of 
how the sun's com-
position changed 
over time. Their 
findings were pub-
lished in the June 1 
issue of Nature. 

According to 
Kcrridge and Marti, 
cbaflges in the sun's 
composition result in 
~inthedlemi­
CII ~of the 
solai wind. The solar 
wind, in tum, influ-
e~ the oitrogce 
levels in the lunar ' 
rocks. 

"Since the sun Is 
so basic to the 
..mv.Iofthe 
........ race,1 
just think It Is a 
..tterol 

When they un-
covered the new in-
formation about 
fluctuating nitrogen 
levels, however, the 
scientists were 
stumped. 

"Now that we sc:e 
there was a decrease, 
followed by an in-
crease, followed by a 
decrease:, this can no 
longer be explained 
by a nuclear process 
because: you'd have 
to postulatethrecdit-
ferent proc:essc:s lIk-
ing place, one after 

prinelpla thai: we

Kerridge. .. And 
that's wildly impos-
sible."

sibilityofthemoon's 

gas per second. This mass contains 
ionized parlic:les of gas (creating the 
phenomena of auroras and geomag-
netic storms upon hitting the earth's 
magnetic field). The sheer force of 
the solar wind embeds nitrogen iso-
topes into the lunar rocks over time. 

Intercstingly,theresearchersfound 
that the levels of nitrogen-14 and ni-
trogen-IS present in the moon '5 rocks 
have not changed as linearly as was 
previously thought. Instead, the lev-
els show a pattern of oscillation start-
ing about 3.S billion years ago.

"He [Massey) is a rare mix of 
administrative talent and techni-
cal ability," said UC Spokesper-
son Terry Colvin. 

"One of the reasons he made 
this decision was really to get 
back into the college atmosphere, 
where he can have a daily give-
and-take [interaction] with fac-
ulty and students," added Colvin.

"Every theory that has come up 

so far has been shot down on the 
basis of this data," Kerridge said. 

The new data has indeed given 
scientists and theorists a reason to 
stop and ponder the factors causing 
such an phenomenal occurence. 

"Since the sun is so basic to the 
survival of the human race, I just 
think it is a matter of principle that 
we should have the best understand-
ing we can of how [it] functions, "

Colleg •• Conduct Survey Students Alerted to Suicide Risks 
SURVEY: Task Force 
questions undergrads 

By Ivan Delventlull 
Senior St.ff Writer 

In an effort to better determine 
students' academic-advising needs, 
the OvIncil of Provosts' Task Force 
on Academic Advising (CYfFAA) 
mailed out scantron-type question-
naires to all UCSD undergraduates 
two weeks ago. 

Task Forte members decided to 
conduct the study after seeing the 
results gathered in a general UCSD 
survey conducted last spring. 

"In the general survey, which is 
conducted every three years, the gen-
eral level of satisfaction for a lot of 
things had dropped," said Cook. "It 
prompted us to say, 'maybe it's time 
for us to learn more about how· stu-
dents perteive academic advising. '" 

The questionnaire is made up of 
approximately 150 questions asking 
students to rate factors such as the 
approachability of academic advi-
sors and their helpfulness. 

"We are trying to determine what 

kindsofadvisiDgncedlltude .... miaI' 
have, or what nUght be an ideal situ-
ation for students," said Mae Brown, 
Marshall Colle. dirccfOr of ICI: 

. demic advising. 
In the final section of the survey, 

students are asked to detail the 
strengths and weaknesses of the ICI-
dernic-advising services provided by 
their resjJcctive colleges and major 
departments. 

"It [the survey) will really be a 
bueline assessment of academic ad-
visingon the UCSDaunpus, "Brown 
said. 

In the fall, the CPTF AA bope5 to 
conduct a survey of all college, staff 
and faculty advisors to supplement 
the results garnered through the un-
dergraduate-student survey. 

"Our ultimate goal is to analyze 
the responses and do correlations," 
said Brown, who added that the Task 
Force hopes to publish survey results 
late next year. 

Although there is no deadline for 
the return of the surveys, both Brown 
and Cook urge all students to com-
plete the questionnaires and submit 
!hem as quickly as possible.

COUNIEUNCI: Help

By ....... M ... 
Senior St.ff Writer 

Pollowing the recent murder-
suicide of two pre-med students at 
Harvard Univenity and two at-
tempted suicides at UCSD in the 
Jut 10 days, staff members at Psy-

. chologiCaland Counseling Services 
(p&:CS) and resident life deans are 
asking students to be aware of 
round-the-c:lock services available 
for those who need help. 

From Jllnuary 1993 to the 
present, two UCSD students have 
committed suicide and six students 
have attempted to kill themselves. 

According to P&:CS Director 
John Giebink, counselors will 
acoomodate all students who need 
help during finals week. 

"We know that students are quite 
distressed and anxious at the end of 
the quarter, and though we do not 
extend our hours, we do manage to 
fit everyone into the schedule," he 
said.

Giebink added that students who 
notice strange behavior in a friend 
or who even feel suicidal them-
selves could also speak to a resi-
dent life dean, assistant dean or 
resident advisor, who are available 
24 houn per day. 

Pat Danylyshyn-Adams, the 
resident life dean at Muir College, 
said that the resident life staff of 
each college is trained to deal with 
suicide crises. 

"Students should know there is 
always someone in resident life they 
can talk to. We want to urge every-
one not to be'afraid to ask for help. 
Tbere is always something that can 
be done," she added. 

Giebink and Adams both said 
that students should look out for 
any possible warning signs, such as 
drastic mood swings or feelings of 
hopelessness which tend to surface 
during finals week. 

Last month's murder-suicide at 
Harvard, in which an undergradu-
ate stabbed her roommate to death 
and then hung herself, came just 
after the end of final exams. 

In a May 29 article which ap-

pcared in the Los Angeles Timu, 
those: who knew Sinedu Tadeue 
said she seemed unusually anxious 
and depressed the week before the 
killings. 

Aa:ording to Professor ofSocioI-
ogy David Phillips, who teac:hes a 
class on suicide at UCSD, "Giving 
away possessions, speaking fre-
quently about death, leaving [final] 
instructions arc all signals that a per-
son might be thinking about suicide." 

Phillips added, however, that he 
did not feel that students at UCSD 
were in a particularly high-risk 
group for suicide. 

"Although the suicide rate for 
college students may be somewhat 
high, most of these deaths oc:cur in 
universities which are highly com-
petitive, such as Oxford or Cam-
bridge," he said. 

He added that statistics indicate 
that UCSD's suicide rate is no 
higher than the national average. 

"Because: the numbers here are 
very sporadic:, it's hard to draw a 
definite conclusion, "he said. "How-
ever, UCSD is not a high-risk 
school."

Current Commissioner of Op-

there were several possibilities for 
the open space, but stressed that a 
final decision has not yet been made. 

Falk said it was too early to know 
what would fill the space, but she 
added that the University Centers 
Advisory Board would be more 
likely to letlhe A.S. retain use of the 
Assorted Vinyl space if the A.S. ran 
a service from the space. 

Falk added that the A.S. must 
submit a proposal by July in order to 
open a business in that location by 
September. 

A sale will be held next week to 
liquidate Assorted Vinyl 's remain-

purchase.

UA W as a legitimate labor union" 
or allow "the California Public Em-
ployee Relations Board to supervise 
democratic elections" among aca-
demic'student employees to give 
them union representation. The pe-
tition had nearly I,SOO signatures 
from students, academic student em· 
ployees and staff members. 
. According to Attiyeh, legal pro· 
ceedings are underway to determine 
whether or not academic·student 
employees are covered by the act. 

However, UCSD DirectorofEm-
ployee and Labor Relations Michael 
Melman stated in alCUerto the union: 
"It is the position of the university 
that unionization of student·aca· 
demic appointees would not be con-
sistent with the university's educa· 
tional mission and would interfere 
with the student/faculty relationship 
which is central to the educational 
process." 

ASE/UA W Executive Board 
Member Carol Christopher dis· 
agreed. "We're in an economic cli-
mate that's forcing the administra-
tion to try to find ways to cut cor-
ners, and [academic-student em-
ployees) are an easy target," she 
said.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 8, 1995 

OPEN LEITER To UCSD STUDENTS, STAFF AND FACULTY 
Editor: 

The national discussion about 
affirmative action has focused the 
interest of the public and the Uni-
versity of California on the types of 
programs we operate to diversify 
our student body, faculty and staff. 
Since its founding, the university 
has been an institution for aU Cali-
fornians. Daniel Coit Gilman, the 
first UC president, expressed this 
fundamental principle in his inau-
gural address of 1872: " ... This is the 
'University of California' ... the uni-
versity of this state. It must be 
adapted to this people: .. to their pe-
culiar geographical position, to the 
requirements of their new society 
and their undeveloped resources. It 
is 'of the people and for the 
people' .... It opens the door of su-
perior education to all .... " 

Over 30 years ago, the UC re-
gents established programs aimed at 
bringing to the university individu-
als who have historically faced un-
equal access to education. During 
the 1980s, the regents adopted the 
statement that it is the university'S 
mission to enroll students who are 
"geographically, culturally, racially, 
economically and .socially di-
verse .... " I enthusiastically support 
this policy. There is no question that 
diversity is essential to the strength 
and welfare of the university, the 
state of California and the nation. 

~ one ~f the nation's leading 
institutions of higher education, we, 
at UCSD have an obligation to com-
mUl1icate and clarify the policies 
ancrjuacti'ifS of ow affirmativejl<;-
tion programs. We have explained 
the content of our admissions and 

outreach programs to the commu-
nity and the media, and will con-
tinue to be actively involved in dis-
cussions on affirmative action. We 
must protect our accomplishments 
in the area of affirmative action and, 
where appropriate, improve upon 
our programs. ExceUence and diver-
sity are complimentary principles 
which guide UCSD. The student 
body and workforce of this campus 
exemplify these principles. 

A great public university must 
servo all of its citizens, and affirma-
tive action is critical to achieving 
this objective. lam committed to 
making UCSD a place of intellec-
tual excellence and moral well-be-
ing, rich in ethnic and cultural di-
versity.

UCSA Cuts Are • 
Must for Campus ute 
Editor: 

The contribution that UCSD has 
made to the University of Califor-
nia Students' Association (UCSA) 
has recently been a hot topic both in 
A.S. meetings and in the Guardian. 
However, representation of this is-
sue has been quite one-sided, to say 
the least. As a result, UCSD students 
have been left uninformed as to all 
of the facts regarding this topic. 

It is absurd for Brent Johnson 
to say that we were not thinking of 
our constituents when we passed the 
proposal to cut UCSA funding 
(" A.S. Shoots Itself in the Foot 
Again," June 1,1995). Many of us 
on the council spent a great deal of

time talking to our constituents, ask-
ing them what they thought should 
be done about the UCSA. The over-
whelming majority of people to 
whom I personally talked were in 
favor of cutting the UCSA contri-
bution at least partially, if not com-
pletely. The purpose of UCSA is to 
represent the individual campuses 
on UC systemwide issues. What has 
been forgotten is that UCSD is un-
like the other UC campuses. Ut's 
facc it - this must be one of the 
most boring and apathetic universi-
ties in this country, if not the world. 
Every weekend, students flock 
homeward, away from UCSD in 
search of some sort of social life 
which simply cannot be found here. 
• From reading Johnson's com-

mentary, it became quite obvious 
that he has never heard of the word 
"research." He mentioned that the 
UCSA is projecting a $4,952 short-
fall for this year. The proposed cut 
is for the 1995-96 school year and 
would therefore have absolutely no 
effect on this year's UCSA budget. 
The actual projected shortfall for 
next year is $5,824. However, this 
shortfall is a result of a $9,928 to-
tal increase in stipends, salaries, 
benefits and taxes caused by those 
increases. Anybody with common 
sense will tell you that you do not 
give your employees raises if it is 
going to cause you to lose money. 
The proposed cut to one dollar-per-
student-per-year would simply be 
a $6,900 decrease to proposed 
raises. 

It is unfathomable to say that this 
year's Sun God Festival did not live 
up to those of previous years. 
Johnson might not have liked the 
musical selection, but you cannot 
argue with the fact that 7,000 people 
!ihowed up, making it the most 
highly attended festival ever. If that 
is unsuccessful, I hope everything 
we do is unsuccessful. 

Where in the world did Johnson 
get the idea that the activity fee is 
$45 per quarter? Obviously, 
Mommy and Daddy pay his bills, 
or he would have definitely seen 
that the activity fee is clearly listed 
as $13.50 on the statements the uni-
versity sends out every quarter. 
When you've only got $13.50 to 
work with, that SO cents is a pretty 
good chunk. 

In response to Marshall Junior 
Senator Fernando Pacheco's letter to 

the editor (" A.S. Budget Fails to 
Meet Student Needs," June 5,1995), 
the cut to the UCSA contribution had 
absolutely IK)thing to do with the ad-
dition of the athletic tailgate events 
to the executive budget. If Pacheco 
had been paying attention during the 
last A.S. meeting, _e would have 
seen VP Finance Edmondo 
Robinson pull out the budget request 
for the tailgate events which had 
originally been submitted to the Stu-
dent Organization Finance Board 
(SOFB). The bolrd suggested that 
the item be brought to the finance 
committee to make it a part of the 
executive budget due to the size of 
the request. 

As far as the tailgate events be-
ing "crappy," as Johnson so elo-

,quently put it, he should ask Com-
missioner of Programming Kevin 
Moo just exactly how far that 
money will go. The purpose of the 
events is net simply to liven up a 
dead campus, it is to bring people 
out to support our athletes. I am in 
full support of our athletes and will 
not hesitate to do anything I can to 
help them, including tailgate events. 

Before you, the students of this 
campus, form an opinion regarding 
any issue, please consider all of the 
relevant facts.

THE [YJfI[ 
SEANRAHIMI 

I Had a Dream: 
Houston in Six 

Hakeem vs. Shaquille. The 
Dream vs. The Daddy. Greatest 
player in the NBA vs. Klank 
Fu. 

It 's a match-up made in 
heaven. Agility against raw 
power. Quickness against brute 
force. (Basically, I just did not 
want to see Rick "Smits 
Happens" get. wacked by 
Olajuwon in the Finals). 

In any case, we have come 
to the end of the road with only 
the NBA championship trophy 
remaining unclaimed. Al-
though no one picked the 
Houston Rockets to advance 
past the first round, they have 
made it all the way to the 
Finals, proving the old adage: 
"You can never underestimate 
the heart of a champion." On 
its way, Houston look care of 
the top three seeds in the 
Western Conference. 

Third-seeded Utah went 
down to Rudy T's bunch in 
five games. Next came the 
"Chuck Wagon" from Phoenix, 
and Houston's Mario Elie blew 
them a kiss on the way to the 
Rockets' deciding game-seven 
triumph. 

Dennis Rodman and friends 
came knocking at the door in 
the conference finals. Even 
though Rodman changed hair 
color five times and David 
Robinson picked up his MVP 
trophy, San Antonio was not 
able to overcome Hakeem 
Olajuwon's stellar perfor-
mance. Houston won three 
games in the Alamodome and 
finished off the Spurs in 
Houston. 

Hakeem has been a true 
"Dream" in these playoffs, 
averaging more than 30 points 
and 10 rebounds per game. He 
made a mess out of one of the 
best defensive centers in the 
game (David Robinson) and 
looks to put Shaq in the 
popcorn machine when they 
meet in Orlando. 

But, what is so exeptional 
about Hakeem is the way he 
has raised his teammates ' level 
of play. The sleepy-looking 
Robert Horry has proven big in 
recent games, and Sam 
Cassel's balding head has been 
found under the rim after many 
a lay-up. Both Cassel and 
Horry have indeed provided a 
spark for the Rockets. 

However, the key to 
Houston 's success so rar has 
been the presence of Clyde 
"The Glide" Drexler. He 
provides the defending 
champions with the desire, 
indicative of someone who has 
never won a litle. Drexler 
brings the on-court intensity 
and fire that Houston needs. 

I think Houston will prevail 
over Orlando with Drexler's 
help.There is no way that Klank 
Fu can hang with The Dream. 
But if I were you, I'd put 20 
dollars on Orlando since my last 
prediction (Spurs over Pacers) 
didn't exactly materialize.

Despite regularly competing

letes are still 

special? I often won-
der about such 
things. 

At. an athlete at 
UCSD, I have been

letes. ' wonder 
why such feats are 

When an indi-
vidual at UCSD 
thinksof collegiate

might be the UCLA

place on my .. lf. 

Four or maybe even the Nebraska 
football team winning the national 
championship. Such events are wit-
nessed by millions of people and 
come to be seen as the pinnacle of 
intercollegiate athletics. 

This makes the other two divi-
sions of NCAA athletics seem sec-

not considered IS 
spectacular IS when they are ac-
complished by Division • athletes. 
Is a National Championship not a 
national championship when pre-
ceded by "Division III"? 

Perhaps the popular perception 
is that Division 111 competition in-
volves athletes of much lower cali-

ond rate in comparison. Why is it ber than Division I. 
this way? What makes Division' so • would like to make a claim 

regarding this misconception. Many 
UCSD teams compete in confer-
ences where aU the other teams are 
Division' or II. 

In fact, many of our teams com-
pete against big-name schools like 
UCLA, Berkeley, and Stanford on a 
regular basis. We currently have, 
and have had, someoutstandingath-
letes at this school. 

A name some of you might rec-
ognize is Scott Sargeant, a two- . 
time National Champion in the 
hammer throw. He is currently 
training for the Atlanta Games in 
1996. Another potential Olympian 
is Travis Miller, a former AII-
American swimmerand a National 
Champion at UCSD. 

Currently attending UCSD is 
women's water polo player Julie 
Swail. Swail was a member of the 

. Triton water polo team which was 
c;rowned National Champion last 
year. During that summer, she went 
on to play for the USA Women's 
National Team in Rome. She will 
play for them again this summer as 
they make a run for future Olym-
pics. 

Unfortunately, our 
competitor is struggling 

with this simple test: 
o True 
o False 

Now we' re not saying anyone 's lying, you understand. 

It's just The Princeton Review can 't seem to figure out exactly what's 
true. Their advertised average LSAT score improvement dropped from 
"10+ poin~s " in 1993 to 7.5 last year. Now an arbitration panel has 
ruled that their "study" really only supported an average improvement 
of 6 .9 points. That same arbitration panel ruled similarly for their 
MCAT, GRE and GMAT studies . 

In fact , Princeton Review has been forced to abandon or lower every 
score claim that has ever been legally challenged and resolved . 

It's no' wonder more than twice as many students take K ..... , 
the acknowledged leader in LSAT, MeAT, GMAT and GRE preparation. 
Our expert instructors know the tests inside out, so they can help 
you get your highest possible score. And our score improvements are 
backed by rock·solid Price Waterhouse studies.

IhI Truth About Test PI,..."" «;=pr'll. 

J.J. Castner was on the U.S. 
junior national team that com-

peted at the World Cross Country 
Championships in Amorebieta, 
Spain. These athletic ac:bievements 

rank our athletes among the best 
in all three NCAA divisions. 
Yet, I wonder why Division I 
athletes are admired so much 
more. 

Part of the reason is that Division 
• schools can offer full scholanhips 
to attract the nation's top athletes. 
Since Division III schools cannot 
offer athletic scholarships, they at-
tract a different kind of student-
athlete. 

The philosophy of Division III 
"places the highest priority on the 
overall quality of the educational 
experience ... Thus, Division III en-
tices students who believe the pri-
mary reason for attending college is 
to further their education. 

"Division III member institutions 
place special importan<:e on the im-
pact of athletics on the participants, 
rather than on spectators. They place 
greater emphasis on the internal 
constituency, rather than on the gen-
eral public and its entertainment 
needs." (NCAA Manultl) 

This translates to: the Division 
III athlete competes primarily for 
his or her own reasons. I have found 
that Division III athletes compete 
simply for the love of the sport. 

This is not to say that Division I 
and II athletes do ~ love theirsports 
nor that we would necessarily mind 

- ' 

-

being compensated for doing some-
thing we love. It merely means that 
the perks that accompany a Divi-
sion I slanding arc not present to 
entice students to come out for Di-
vision III athletics. 

The Division IIi athlete is mel 
with the following roadblocks when 
participating in an intercollegiate 
sport: no priority acceptance to the 
institution, no priority enrollment in 
classes, and no big-time budgets for 
perks such as food.

SCORE IMPROVEMENT CLAIMS IN TEST PREP: 
. 

How ACCURATE? 
By Andrew S. Rosen-J.D., Yale University'" 

For a number of years, test preparation compa-nies have sought to persuade students with II average score improvement" claims_ In some 
recent cases, these claims have been supported by 
reliable, statistically valid studies_ But, unfortunately, 
many claims have been based on unreliable studies, 
or no studies at all. 

The relative approaches of the two leading competitors 
in the test preparation business are instructive. All of the 
score claims of Kaplan Educational Centers, the founder 
of the test prep, have been supported by comprehensive 
studies conducted by a large and highly-'respected ac-
counting firm. The industry's second-place firm, The 
Princeton Review, by contrast, has made a bewildering 
array of score claims in its short history -- and has been 
forced to withdraw claims they could not adequately sup-
port_ Other, smaller competitors in the business have 
made score claims, but rarely based on valid statistical 
studies. 

Unlike any other competitor, Kaplan did not merely 
make a claim based on purported /I internal studies." In-
stead, it commissioned Price Waterhouse, the huge inter-
national accounting firm, to design and conduct a com-
prehensive study of its students. 

The methodology of the Kaplan' study was upheld as 
reliable in an arbitration panel convened between Kaplan 
and Princeton Review to adjudicate advertising disputes. 
Kaplan has since released similar Price Waterhouse stud-
ies, conducted with similar methodology, for its LSAT (law 
school), GMAT (business school), GRE (graduate school) 
and MeAT (medical school) programs. 

The Princeton Review (TPR), founded in the early 
1980's, relied on score improvement claims for its mar-
keting nearly from the beginning. Unfortunately, while it 
was remarkably effective in marketing and advertising, 
TPR appears at times to have paid scant attention to va-
lidity or accuracy in its claims. 

Starting with the SAT, TPR began making claims that 
its program's average score was "110-160" points. Even 
more puzzling than the notion that an average could be a 
range was the fact that this claim was based on a series of 
self-selected, unreliable surveys by a fairly random as-
sortment of parties. (In each of the independent studies 
that matched TPR and Kaplan head-to-head, Kaplan 
outpointed TPR. Kaplan refused to promote the studies 
because they deened the studies too unreliable and un-
representative for advertising, and the differences were 
not statistically significant.) TPR's "110-160" ads were ul-
timately struck down as unreliable in legal proceedings. 

TPR's use of graduate score studies has been equally 
disconcerting. For several years in the early 1990's, TPR 
boldly asserted that its programs improved students' 
scores by remarka~le amounts. When those numbers were 
legally challenged, TPR acknowledged it might not have 
all the back up for its purported II studies," and under 

(Advertised with ' no 
study cited: withdrawn 

under legal threat) 

Princeton Review'S 
Declining Score 
Claims (LSAT) 

threat of legal proceedings agreed to cease advertising 
those figures. TPR soon unveiled new, lower figures it 
claimed had been "verified by a Big Six firm," but those 
numbers also were struck down by an arbitration panel. 

TPR's score claim history in one program, LSAT, has 
steadily been lowered when challenged. First is TPR's 
intitial claim that its course improves student's score by 
an average of 10.4 points--a figure TPR withdrew when 
challenged. That claim shrunk to 7.5 points when an in-
dependent party was asked to count .survey postcards. 
Even that figure was deemed overstated by an arbitra-
tion panel, which ruled in early 1995 that using corrected 
baseline figures the average score improvement was ac-
tually 6_9 points--but because the response rate on that 
study was so low, the panel ruled that TPR could not ad-
vertise even the reduced figure after March 1996. 

More recently, TPR abandoned any pretense of using a 
respected Big Six firm (or indeed any accounting firm) 
and released score improvement studies by the polling 
firm Roper Starch. Although TPR is currently advertis-
ing these studies, they too have been challenged as mis-
leading and inaccurately overstated. 

Competition in the test preparation industry is fierce, 
and many or the competitors have responded by making 
. claims about average score improvement that are not jus-
tified by solid, reliable studies. Indeed, only the industry's 
largest player, Kaplan, has offered statistically valid, reli-
able studies that have been judicially upheld.

YOUNG GUNS 
SENIOR SALUTE: The departure of Robert Ho leaves the 
young Tritons to fend for themselves in the West Region 

The UCSD men's tennis team season 
can be described with two words: com-
petitive and exhausting. It was a rough 
year fortht Tritons in the highly competi-
tive West Region. The West dominated all 
regions, as UC Santa Cruz went on to win 
the NCAA team championship. 

With a difficult schedule of matches, 
the Tritons finished out the year respec-
tively. They had a tiring season of con-
tinuous back-to-back matches. The sched-
ule seemed even more difficult due to the 
injuries which plagued the UCSD squad 
all year. 

The Tritons have already begun their 
preparations for next season by hitting the 
courts everyday to ready themselves for a 
strong comeback. UCSD has a solid return-
ing lineup for next year as it is only losing 
one player. How-
ever, that one player 
will be a big loss. 

pain. 
Although the Tritons didn't make it to 

the NCAA Tournament, Ho and returning 
standout Dan Brounstein 
successfuJly represented the 
team in the individual tour-
nament in Kalamazoo, 
Michigan. 

Although HO'sdeparture 
will greatly affect the team, 
the final match of the season 
gave an encouraging 
glimpse into the future. Dur-
ing this match against Point 
Lorna Nazarene, UCSD mounted a ster-
ling comeback in singles, after losing in 
doubles. 

"I was very proud of the way we came 
back after doubles [against PI. Loma)," 

Ho said. "This 
is something 
that the guys 
should remem-
ber for next 
year. The good 
teams don't 
panic when they 
are down, they 
just believe 
they'regoing to 
win, and they 
usually do." 

The shoes of 
Robert Ho, the 
team's number one 
player, will cer-
tainly be tough to 
fill. Who will wear 
that intimidating 
bandana and act the 
part of the team 
leader next season? 
A four-year lelter-
winner, Ho has 
demonstrated expe-
rience and leader-
ship throughout his 
tenure at UCSD. 

Luckily for 
the Tritons, 
they are return-
ing a strong 
nucleus of play-

Robert Ho: A four-year letterman and the 
number-one ranked player on the Triton 
squad, his leadership and experience on 
the court will undoubtedly be missed by 
the youthful UCSD team. 

ers next year, 
including five of the top six on their lad-
der. This depth of experience bodes well 
for the future of men's tennis at UCSD. 

This past season, despite playing with 
an injured leg, Ho always managed to pull 
out the necessary victories in spite of the 

LOOKING UP 
SENIOR sALInE: Tyson Kerr s graduation leaves some big 
shoes to fil~ but victory over SDSU holds promise for future 

The UCSD volleyball team endured a sea-
son that came painfully close to ending with-
out promise for the future. Then, it the lISt 

possible opportunity and under the 
least likely of circumstances, the 
Tritons came through with quite 

, possibly the biggest victory in UCSD 
volleyball history. No one blames 
the Tritons for their struggles. After 
all, they are competing in the Moun-
tain Pacific Sports Federation, argu-
ably the toughest league in colle-
giate volleyball. Night in 
and night out, the UCSD 

squad is up against seemingly in-
surmountable odds, playing 
against future members of the U.S. 
National Team and learning the 
"ins and outs" of Division I com-
petition the hard way. 

But, on the night when the Tri-
tons great~t star was making his 
final appearance, UCSD managed 
to turn the whole thing around. 
How, you ask, could one match 
change the entire outlook of Tri-
ton volleyball? Simple: UCSD 
toppled top-ranked, arch-rival San 
Diego State University witlwutthe 
services ofthe aforementioned all-
time great, Tyson Kerr. 

In acontest which will undoubt-
edly go down in the annals of 
UCSD sporting history, the Tri-
tons collected their first-ever vic-
tory over a Division I team in a 
five-set thriller at RIMAe. 

In one fell swoop, that win transformed the 
fortunes ofTriton volleyball. Despite the ab-
sence of Kerr, UCSD's youthful core has 
hope because - on the final night of this year 
- they conquered SDSU with Kerr watching 
from the bench for the better half of the match. 

"That tells you a lot about the kids," Dan-
nevi k said. "They could have packed it in, but 
they kept playing hard all season. The kids 
have a lot of pride in the program." 

They may have gone 2-21, but things have 
never looked rosier for the Tritons. 

"This validates that we're tak-
ing the right steps to building the 
program," Head Coach Doug Dan-
nevik said.

BALANCE: 
Division III athletes 
work just as hard 
ContInued fIom ..... 2.0 
want to compete on this level? I do 
not wlnt to sound like I resent the 
fact that such amenities are not 
offered to me. Far from it, I 1m 
glad thllt I run at an institution 
where such enticements are not 
present. 

I have been told that there is 
silent pressure from the university 
to be more of a thoroughbred than a 
runner. You feel as though you are 
running to keep the scholarship 
money -and million-dollar corpo-
rate sponsorships coming to your-
self and the school. 

I have also known athletes who 
grew to hate the sport they had once 
loved because it became more of a 
job than a sport. I'm sure that the 
majority of athletes mmpeting in 
Division I programs thoroughly en-
joy their collegiate athletic experi-
ence. 

But, a few have expressed to me 
their desire to run for the sport of it, 
rather than to ensure a renewal of 
their scholarship for the next semes· 
ter. 

I work at RIMAC to earn money 
for school and other things, like 
running shoes. I attend classes ev-
ery day, and I am accorded no spe-
cial treatment (though some gra· 
cious professors have granted me 
helpin times of conflict, like trips to 

Nati~nals ). 
J. then rush out to practice every 

day and run. I'm just your average 
UCSD student-athlete - not ath-

Iete-student. 
I came to this university for an 

educ:ation, and I wu lucky enough 
to find an institution that eaabled 
me to continue to do something I 
love - ruMing. 

I have the utmost respect and 
admiration for Division I athletes, 
for I can only hope and dream to 
someday reach that caliber of run-
ning. 

I feel, however, that I'm get-
ting more out of my athletic expe-
rience than my Division I counter-
parts. I compete at a high level for 
an outstanding team, and the only 
pressure is that which I place on 
myself. 

I don't believe any of us are 
seeking fame for our athletic 
achievements here at UCSD. We 
simply strive for the personal satis-
faction of knowing the effort and 
hours of practice we put in are all 
worthwhile. Is that not deserving of 
a little respect~ . 
, The time com'mittment and ef· 
fort put into each sport, regardless 
of the division of competition, is the 
same. I believe the heart and dedica-
tion of Division III far exceeds thai 
of the other two, more publicized, 
divisions. 

To mmpete on a level with ath· 
letes who receive compensation for 
their efforts, and to succeed as UCSD 
does, requires more than talent alone. 
Is that not to be admired? After all, 
a National Championship is still a 
National Championship, be it Divi-
sion I or Division III . . 

We may not have a Division I 
program like UCLA or Nebraska, 
but I'm still proud to be a UCSD 
Triton athlete.

CONGO 

Based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, Congo 
tells the story of two unlikely partners in search of the legendary 
lost city ofZinj and its fabled diamonds. In the uncharted regions 
of Africa, the explorers discover a place where everything they 
understand about nature has gone berserk, making them the 
endangered species. Crichton, who wrote Jurassic Parle, is a 
genius at turning the ordinary into the unexpected, which could 
make Congo the movie to see for the summer.

The film was well received in the 
1995 Cannes Film Festival for its 

jarringly reatistic portrayal of

screenplay {or Kids was 

written by 19-year-old Harmone Korine at the request of 
Clark who met him by taking photographs of teenagers in 
Washington Square Park. With Gus Van Sant among the

The Brtdges of 
Madison County 

Eastwood aims for the heart in film 
based on Robert James Wallers novel 

By Mike M8rtlnez 
Contributiflll Writer 

Robert James Waller's TheBridgesofModi-
son County is one of the most beloved love 
stories of our pop culture since, wel~ Love Story 
in 1969. Waller's literary valentine is just self-
absotbed enough to strike a chord with millions 
of like-minded audience members in this de-
cade of self-h~lp. Now the eagerly anticipated 
screen version is here - an undertak-
ing that is marked by peculiar contra-
dictions. 

Director Clint Eastwood attempts 
to translate Waller's descriptive, florid 
prose to film. He and screenwriter Ri-
chard LaGravenese dispense with most 
of Waller's verbose asides to concen-
trate on a. simple L11F. of romance be-
tween Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a 
free-spirited wanderer, and Francesca Johnson 
(Meryl Streep), a married but unfulfilled mother 
of two. 

The year is 1965 and Kincaid, a photogra-
pher for Nationol Geographic, has traveled to 
Madison County, fA, to take pictures of the 
county's covered bridges. He gets lost and hap-
pens onto the farmhouse of Francesca, who's 
alone for four days while the family is away. 
Kincaid is a creative artist; she's a bored house-
wife. Kincaid instantly taps into her soul, and 
they ' re both changed forever. 

Although Kincaid and Francesca's 
temperments clash, their attraction for each 
other is overwhelming. Naturally, they must 
separate at the end of the four days, but even 
after they part, they hold onto their memories. 
This metaphysical quality is what gives Bridges 
its hold on readers and viewers. 

The acting styles of Eastwood and Streep 
also contrast with each other. Eastwood usually 

puts such an everyman spin on his 
complex loner roles that they seem a 
part of himself, yet he's not quite in 
character playing Kincaid. 

Although Eastwood's rugged per-
sonality may seem to mirror Kincaid 's, 
this role is a stretch for him because of 
its romantic nature. He's awkward at 
times (particularly when he enters the 
film in a Waller-like wardrobe of 
s~nders and shaggy hairdo) but evetually, 
hi"'s easygoing likability emerge. 

Streep is likea chameleon, searnlessly meld-
ing right into Francesca and effortlessly con-
veying every detail, from her untapped well of 
emotions to her authentic Italian accent. 

EastwOOd is as economical behind the cam-
era as in front of it. He lets his ~ctors express 
themselves subtly with glances, e;,:pressions 
and gestures. The love ballet that Robert and 
Francesca dance in the kitchen is both light-
hearted and moving, capturing.the feeling one

"Primus 
Tales from the 

Punchbowl 
",.,.11, ......... 

Primus' fifth album, Tales from 
the Punchbowl, is either a drwn or a 
nightmare, depending on your musi-
cal preferenc:es.lf you prefer a strong 
......... rhythm section, you 

will probably like 
Tales, but if you like 
guitar-oriented mu-
sic, you might bedis-
appointed.

Tbunday, June 8, 1995 

urtesy I Halsband 

Les Claypool 's 
bass and Tim 
Alexander's drums 

dominate Tale~ while larry Lalonde 
can only manage to squeeze in a few 
guitar riffs admist the thumping mu-
sic. However, Claypool and Alexander 
are such accomplished musicians that 
the lack of guitar is not a detriment 

Primus Is lAs ~, TIm AleXMder ..... LMry ....... 

Songs such as "Southbound Pachy-
denn" start slowly and build to a 
cascading crescendo of drums and 
bass, while tracks like "Year of the 
Parrot" kickoflwith thunderingdrums 
that pound aU the way to the end. 
These numbers not only showc::ase the 

powerful rhythm section but aIsodem-
Onsllate the band's unique ability to 
stop, start and change pace several 
times during each song . 

Although Oaypool does an admi-
rable job in keeping his vocal hijinx to 
a minimum, he does let loose with his 
nasal twang in songs such as 

"Wynona's Big Brown Beaver" and 
"De Anza Jig," a hillbiUy porch song 
in which he reminisces about high 
school guys who sucked milkshakes 
up the'ir nose and an old love who 
"gave me her virginityl then she gave 
it to everyone/ in our vicinity."
