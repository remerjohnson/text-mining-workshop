Students Rally Against Citizens United

Rep. Scott Peters joined student leaders Tuesday to rally for the overturn of the 
2010 decision which allows large corporations to support political campaigns.

The California Public Interest Research Group 
and Rep. Scott Peters (D-San Diego.) held a 
rally at Warren Mall on Jan. 21, where they 
spoke in favor of overturning Citizens United. 
Representatives from Money out of Politics and 
Common Cause, two grassroots organizations, 
were also invited to speak.

The controversial Supreme Court decision 
— known officially as Citizens United v. Federal 
Election Committee (2010) — involved Citizens 
United, a conservative non-profit organization 
whose self-described goal is “restoring our gov-
ernment to citizens’ control.”

The Court decision struck down parts of 
the 2002 McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign 
Reform Act, which, among other things, pro-

hibited corporations and unions from funding 
broadcasts that mentioned political candidates by 
name within 30 days of a primary election. After 
Citizens United ran advertisements for its 2008 
film, “Hillary: the Movie,” within that timeframe 
of 30 days, the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Columbia found that the group violated the 
BCRA. In a 5–4 ruling, the Supreme Court later 
overturned the judgment, declaring that corpora-
tions could freely pay for direct advocacy — as 
long as it was independent from official cam-
paigns — under the First Amendment. 

While some groups welcomed the change, 
others, like CALPIRG, were less happy. 

UCSD CALPIRG organizer Alex Acuna 
believes that the decision is detrimental to citi-
zens’ rights.

Gov. Jerry Brown announced 
Friday that he will appoint four 
members — including two reap-
pointments — to the UC Board of 
Regents for the 2014 calendar year, 
following confirmation by the state 
senate. 

The chosen regents include mem-
bers Richard C. Blum and Norman 
Pattiz, both of whose terms were set 
to expire in March.

Blum — husband of Democratic 
California Senator Dianne Feinstein 
— is a philanthropist involved in the 
compensation and finance aspects of 
the UC Regents, while Pattiz, head 
of a radio and media company, over-
sees the UC Regents Department of 
Energy Laboratories.

Brown also named newcomer 
investment expert Richard Sherman 
and returning ex-regent Monica 
Lozano, a communications com-
pany executive who completed her 
12-year term last year. Lozano is 
also chief executive officer of the 
country’s largest Spanish newspa-
per publication and holds a position 
on the nation’s Economic Recovery 
Advisory Board.

Sherman will join the board while 
continuing his position as chief exec-
utive for The David Geffen Co.; he 
previously acted as the director of 
DreamWorks SKG Inc. 

UC Regents chair Bruce Varner 
released a statement on Jan. 17 fol-
lowing Brown’s announcement.

“I am very happy that Governor 
Brown has appointed three individu-
als with so much regental experience 
and another who will bring addi-
tional expertise to the University of 
California Board of Regents,” Varner 
said. “It will be great to have Monica 
Lozano back on the board and 
Richard Blum and Norman Pattiz 
continuing their service as regents. 
We look forward to welcoming 
Richard Sherman, whose financial 
and investment experience will be an 
invaluable asset.”

 Brown proposed the appoint-
ments as part of his duties as presi-
dent of the UC Regents in charge 
of selecting the 18 regent members, 
filling four out of seven vacancies on 
the board.

All four Democratic members 
will assume their positions in March 
2014, each beginning a 12-year term 
without compensation.

The current UC Regents is set to 
convene this week for a scheduled 
meeting in UCSF Mission Bay and will 
include a discussion of the governor’s 
recent proposed budget and its impact 
on the University of California.

UCSD researchers released new 
data last week showing that that 
even drivers with a blood alcohol 
concentration of 0.01 are 46 percent 
more likely than sober drivers to be 
blamed by accident investigators for 
traffic collisions. 

UCSD professor David P. Phillips 
and his co-authors, undergradu-
ate economics student Rebecca 
Moshfegh and USC Gould School 
of Law student Ana Luisa Sousa 
conducted the recent study. They 
analyzed 570,731 collisions between 
1994 and 2011 to reach the conclu-
sion that any combination of drink-
ing and driving poses an increased 
risk of traffic accidents.

The researchers drew their 
data from the official U.S. Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System data-
base, which provides national fig-
ures and BAC in percentages. They 

focused on “buzzed drivers” with 
BAC levels ranging from 0.01 to 
0.07, and within that group, they 
specifically looked at “minimally 
buzzed” drivers with a BAC of 0.01.

The study further reveals that 
the chances of drunk drivers receiv-
ing sole official blame for collisions 
grew in steady increments starting 
from around BAC levels of 0.02 
and ending at around 0.24. The 
researchers also discovered that the 
legal limit of 0.08 does not mark the 
level of inebriation that begins to 
severely affect driving ability, caus-
ing no sudden jump from when 
“buzzed drivers” go from blameless 
to blamed. 

From 1991 to 2010, the official 
data shows that traffic collisions are 
the leading cause of fatalities in the 
U.S. with 832, 062 deaths, followed 
by 643, 976 suicides, 393, 512 homi-
cides, and 345,529 unintentional 
poisonings.

Unlike the U.S., more than 100 
countries worldwide have set their 
BAC legal limits to 0.05 percent 
or below, such as Thailand, South 
Korea and Italy. Hoping that the 
study would urge U.S. legislators to 
lower the BAC legal limit to 0.05 
percent, professor Phillips high-
lighted the importance of address-
ing this issue as soon as possible 
to lower the rate of collisions and 
save lives.

“Police, judges and the pub-
lic at large treat BAC 0.08 percent 
as a ‘sharp, definitive, meaning-
ful boundary’ and do not impose 
severe penalties on those below 
the legal limit,” Philips said in a 
Jan. 16 UCSD News Center release. 
“[However], that needs to change. 
The law should reflect what official 
accident investigators are seeing.”

“This issue of Citizens United gets 
at the heart of every issue that we 
have ever worked on and will ever 
work on,” Acuna said. “[Corporations’] 
voices drown out the voices of every-
day people, and the fact that wealthy 
individuals have so much power now 
takes away from my right to have free 
speech and to contribute to the politi-
cal discourse.” 

Peters was elected to Congress in 
2013 and has been active in attempts to 
overturn the Supreme Court decision.

In an interview with the UCSD 
Guardian, Peters said that the deci-
sion “opened the floodgates for 
unlimited amounts of anonymous 
spending in campaigns.” 

“What we want to do is support a 
constitutional amendment to fix that 

problem,” Peters said. “We want to 
support better campaign finance laws, 
proper disclosure of who’s funding 
what and generally want to decrease 
the influence of money in campaigns.” 

He added that politicians spend too 
much time worrying about fundrais-
ing, rather than on important policy 
issues. CALPIRG shares this view and 
devotes itself to “developing student 
leaders and standing up to powerful 
special interests on behalf of the pub-
lic.” They now look to UCSD students 
for support.

“What we’re going to see in the 
issue of money in politics is that people 
and corporations will have their own 
private interests over the public inter-
ests,” Acuna said. “As students, the 
future, if we don’t act, is incredibly 
bleak. The fact that we had a congress-

man come to campus and that we had 
students there who heard and took 
something away from it is powerful.”

Peters agrees that students have the 
ability to influence the future.

“It’s students who really have to 
look ahead,” Peters said. “I think it’s 
important that we talk to young adults 
and make sure that they’re engaged 
and that [they’re] part of the fight to 
protect our democracy and make sure 
that it’s not dominated by special inter-
est money.”

Peters previously served on the San 
Diego City Council before becoming 
the representative for California’s 52nd 
congressional district — which covers 
much of East Campus — in 2013. 

last year, while transfer applications 
increased by 5.8 percent. The average 
high school GPA for freshman appli-
cants was 3.79, and the average SAT 
scores for Critical Reading, Math and 
Writing were 591, 644 and 607 — up 
from last year’s GPA of 3.77 and SAT 
scores of 583, 635 and 595. The average 
transfer applicant’s GPA rose from 3.35 
to 3.37 as well.

“UC San Diego’s global reputa-
tion as an academic powerhouse has 
attracted many talented and well-qual-
ified students,” Chancellor Pradeep 
Khosla said in a UCSD News Center 
release. “Our rankings as one of the 
top universities in the world are testa-
ment to why UC San Diego continues 
to enroll the best and the brightest 
students from all backgrounds.”

While the most popular majors 
selected by freshman applicants 
include engineering, biology, and 
social sciences, almost 50 percent of 
transfer applicants selected a social 

science. The newest UCSD major, 
public health — which has been 
offered since Fall Quarter 2013 — 
was selected by over 900 freshman 
and transfer applicants. 

Fall 2014 freshmen applications 
also displayed a 6.1-percent rise in 
historically underrepresented student 
applications. Native American fresh-
man applications increased by 19 per-
cent from last year. Underrepresented 
transfer applications also rose by 13.8 
percent — 4.3 percent more African 
American applicants, 20 percent more 
Mexican American, and 9.9 percent 
more Latino applicants.

First-generation transfer college 
applications also increased by 9 per-
cent, and the number of low-income 
transfer applicants increased by 
approximately the same amount.

UC campuses also continued to 
see more women than men among 
freshman and transfer applicants; 
UCSD applicants recorded 50.9 per-
cent females, 47.8 percent males and 
1.3 percent declined to state.

The overall volume of applications 
for Fall Quarter 2014 increased by 
4.9 percent from Fall Quarter 2013, 
with a new record high of 183,272 
applicants total. The entire UC system 
marked a 6.2-percent increase in fresh-
men applicants and a slight 0.5-percent 
decrease in transfer applicants.

The majority of transfer appli-
cants are from California community 
colleges. According to Interim Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Alan 
Houston in a UCSD News Center 
release, attracting more trans-
fer applicants is a top priority for 
UCSD. The UniversityLink pro-
gram, designed to allow low-income, 
high-achieving regional community 
college students guaranteed admis-
sion to UCSD, will be relaunched 
for Fall Quarter 2015 enrollment. 
Participating community colleges 
include those in San Diego County 
and Imperial County.

Kyle Heiskala began last night’s 
Council meeting with the same joke 
as last week.

“This week I am here as the 
SOVAC director; I’ve got my SOVAC 
hat on, if you hadn’t noticed,” Heiskala 
said. Unlike last week, however, he 
had an actual cap on. 

He introduced his successor as 
executive director 
of SOVAC, Avril 
Prakash. 

“I really want 
to strengthen 
the relationship 
between SOVAC and A.S.,” Prakash 
said. “I see a lot of great opportunities 
for voter registration, voter education 
and empowering students.”

AVP College Affairs Meena 
Kaushik then made a presentation 
explaining her office and changes 
she would like to see. Unsurprisingly, 
she expressed the need to expand 
her office and increase revenue by 
referenda. She also presented ideas for 
“instilling a sense of pride and spirit,” 
including class councils.

“It will allow us to create new 
traditions that are class-specific, like 
senior prank and senior ditch day,” 
Kaushik said. “It will address a lot of 
issues that unify a class.”

She also suggested that, at events 
like Spirit Night, classes compete the 
way that colleges currently compete, 
like at high school rallies. Although 
her ideas suggest a strong desire to go 
back to high school, her next point 
did accurately illuminate the current 
dreary state of campus pride:

“The thing with Spirit Night is 
everyone remembers which college 
won, not whether UCSD even won 
the basketball game.”

Her ideas were inspired by student 
governments at other schools with 
college systems, including Rice, Yale 
and UC Santa Cruz.

“Fun fact: three of the colleges at 
UCSC are called College 8, College 
9 and College 10,” Kaushik said. “So 
Sixth College, you guys have some 
homies over there.”

Later, President Andy Buselt 
admitted that he expected Kaushik to 
present actual language for how a new 
College Affairs office would be struc-

tured. He asked for 
volunteers inter-
ested in construct-
ing and writing the 
language for a new 
office, to no avail. 

Sorry Bylaws Committee; looks like 
this one’s on you.

Next, debate ensued over new 
bylaws and whether academic sena-
tors should be elected or appointed. 
The argument for appointing the posi-
tion is that an election could essen-
tially turn into a popularity contest.

“I take issue with the point that it’s 
a popularity contest, and it’s just about 
the best colors or the prettiest face,” 
Revelle Senator Soren Nelson said. 
“Because then what the fuck are we all 
doing here? That’s how we got here.”

After general counting confusion 
during voting — causing one vote to 
be carried out by each voter counting 
off aloud — the amendment failed. 
The positions will be elected by people 
from the majors within the division of 
each academic senator.

Before voting to pass the docu-
ment as a whole, the amendment was 
made to ensure that academic sena-
tors do not run associated with any 
slate. The amendment passed 20-7-0.

Finally, Freshman Senator Rushil 
Patel announced that Freshman 
Council will be holding a Cub 
Garden, an under-21-friendly spin-off 
on Bear Gardens.

“We’re first years; we don’t drink 
at all,” Patel said. Ensue nervous 
chuckles.

While I concur with my editorial board colleagues that there are alterna-
tives to shortening this year’s winter 
break by a full week, I felt the need to 
recuse myself from this week’s edito-
rial to give a more personal take on 
the change. As an observant Jewish 
student, whom this change most 
intends to accommodate, I can’t help 
but feel lost in the reasoning behind 
the switch.

The UC administrators who 
instituted the change are kidding 
themselves if they think this change 
will provide blanket accommoda-
tion to Jewish students with holiday 
conflicts at the beginning of the 
academic year. While no classes 
or move-in dates will conflict with 
either of the first two Jewish holidays 
Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) 
and Yom Kippur, many observant 
Jewish students will still miss class 
for significant portions of Week 1 
and Week 2 in the fall for the lesser-
known Sukkot holiday.

This change sets a dangerous 
precedent — namely, that the UC 
system will need to accommodate 
the needs of all faiths moving 

forward. With the immense diver-
sity of backgrounds and beliefs at 
UCSD and across the state, it would 
seem that we would need to close 
the university at least once a week 
between September and August to 
accommodate every person’s per-
sonal practice.

The policy is well intentioned, 
but it creates more problems for 
Jewish students than it solves. I 
worry that Jewish students here 
and around the system will be seen 
as the “cause” of everyone’s loss of 
break, which is particularly unfair 
seeing that no Jewish group on our 
campus was approached about the 
switch. Online comments on the 
UCSD Guardian’s coverage of the 
change, like “Can’t favor one minor-
ity,” or “it’s probably because the 
[UC] Board of Regents is full of 
Jewish people” are prime examples of 
the accusations I fear will mount as 
anger at the change. Sentiments that 
perpetuate old stereotypes of Jewish 
power and influences are sure to fol-
low the change with no other obvi-
ous scapegoat.

Balancing our observance with 
attending a secular university (which, 

until now, operated independent of 
the Jewish calendar) is a choice that 
all religious students make. We don’t 
expect to be “accommodated” more 
than any other group, and when con-
flicts arise, observant students know 
which channels to go through to get 
accommodations. Never has a profes-
sor told me or any of my observant 
friends that Jewish practices will get 
in the way of rescheduling a Saturday 
(read: Sabbath) exam, nor have I ever 
had trouble making up work for the 
days I take off for Passover.

The Los Angeles Unified School 
District routinely closes down for 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, 
which I don’t believe solves the entire 
problem of the UC system, but it is 
a much better option than ruining 
everyone else’s winter break. There are 
any number of solutions that could 
help observant Jewish students on UC 
campuses that don’t negatively impact 
the much larger number of UC stu-
dents who are not religious Jews.

Guardian website commenter 
“albert” summed it up perfectly: 
“I’m Jewish and I don’t even agree 
with this.”

Me neither, Albert. Me neither.

I t’s a pain for Jewish students and families to have to worry about the chaos of move-in and orienta-tion during a major religious holiday, but shorten-
ing everyone’s winter break is not the answer. There 
are other solutions that could have solved this issue, 
and it’s concerning that such a decision appears to 
have been made with virtually no student input.

The charter for the calendar shakeup is actually a 
2007 UC-wide policy change that mandates that the 
university change move-in dates that coincide with 
religious holidays. In response to concerns raised by 
Jewish advocacy groups about the issue in 2006, the 
UC system enacted the Policy for Addressing Religious 
Holiday Conflicts with Residence Hall Move-In Days. 
It was last put to use in 2009 when UC Berkeley and 
UC Merced’s move-in dates were shifted to accommo-
date Muslim students who celebrate Ramadan.

We think it’s great that the UC system wants to be 

considerate of religious observances, but they should 
offer these special accommodations for students on an 
individual basis, rather than make a multiple campus-
wide change that creates more problems. 

The simplest solution would be to grant exceptions 
allowing students to move into campus housing a 
day earlier or later than the holiday in question, free-
of-charge. The 2007 policy actually holds campuses 
responsible for making these special arrangements 
for students if a move-in or orientation date falls on a 
religious holiday. With other options available, it seems 
bizarre and extreme to take a stab at our already short 
winter break.

While the policy may be beneficial for a very select 
few of students, it is a considerable inconvenience for 
just about everyone else. International students from 
Europe or Asia, for example, will now only have two 
weeks to fly home, shake off their jetlag and spend

Last Sunday, as I clinked glasses of sparkling wine with my roommate over unpronounce-
able Italian delicacies, I came to a 
somber realization: The two of us 
would be going our separate ways 
after graduation in six months, and 
this dinner marked the end of our 
four-years-running Restaurant Week 
tradition. Next year, there would be 
no more pretending to know which 
utensil was the “appetizer fork,” 
no more toning down our colorful 
vocabulary in the presence of respect-
able La Jollans (and their horribly 
pretentious children) and certainly no 
more receiving harried texts from our 
mothers demanding an explanation 
of the not-so-Rigoberto’s charge on 
our cards.

Inevitably, as the email solicitations 
for graduate portraits become more 
frequent, I will encounter many more 
“lasts” with the friend I’ve shared 
laughs with since moving in freshman 
year. I’d like to believe that my best 
friend now will still be my best friend 
when I’m 50, but a psychology profes-
sor of mine once told my class that 
the average shelf life of a friendship 
is seven years. If I take this statistic at 
face value, that only allots me and my 
roommate three more years to build 
our Grand Canyon’s worth of inside 
jokes. Thank you, Dutch sociologist 
Gerald Mollenhorst, for this enlight-
ening tidbit of information.

I know I won’t let this become a 
reality, but I hope that other gradu-
ates won’t take their friendships for 
granted after their group has splin-
tered into pieces. The symptoms of 
a dying friendship are familiar to 
most of us: increasingly infrequent 
texts, the constant flaking on plans 
(only to have Facebook inform 
you that, no, they didn’t have food 
poisoning as was so claimed), only 
reaching out to you for favors — to 
the eventual silence.

Mollenhorst was dead-on when 
he said that personal relationships 
tend to disintegrate when it is no 
longer convenient for friends to be 
in the same context. Presently, the 
opportunity of seeing all of your 
closest friends only necessitates a 
maximum of 10 minutes’ advance 
notice. You eat, study, hang out and 
go on weekly Trader Joe’s scavenger 
hunts together. Next year, when some 
friends will be going overseas while 
others will be job-searching and 
attending graduate schools across 
several different states, you will 
have to set aside time for Skype as a 
replacement for in-person interac-
tion. Noncommittally “liking” an 
Instagram photo or sending a mass 
Snapchat doesn’t quite match up 
to a regular phone call or jump-
ing at every chance to make a visit. 
Behavior like the former may even-
tually bump you down from being 
practical soul mates to being “The 
Brunch Catch-Up Friend,” an insult 
of the highest kind.

It takes effort to upkeep a 
puzzle-piece group of friends after 
you move away, but it’s certainly 
possible. As Vitamin C hopes, after 
you’ve got the big jobs and made 
the big money, maybe you will still 
find the same jokes funny. And if 
you’re having doubts, just remem-
ber that the cripplingly awkward 
pair of Ross and Chandler seemed 
to have made it work.

Deceivingly 
DiCaprio:
Dress to 
Excess 

P eople don’t like bankers. The 2008 financial crisis and sub-sequent revelations of financial 
chicanery and outright fraud made 
them easy to hate. Martin Scorsese’s 
job in directing “The Wolf of Wall 
Street,” then, is pretty damn easy: 
Make a movie with financiers act-
ing depraved, entertain us with some 
lurid drug scenes, throw in a bunch 
of beautiful naked people, let Leo be 
Leo and we will lap it up. So far, his 
formula has worked. Some Golden 
Globe love and five Oscar nomina-
tions are respectable credentials.

To be clear: “Wolf” is a solid 
movie. I don’t think it’s a great movie, 
partly for purely aesthetic reasons, but 
mostly because I think it does a bad 
thing to us.

The main character of “Wolf,” 
Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), 
starts the film wanting to get rich, 
do drugs and fornicate. Then, for the 
rest of the film, Belfort gets rich, does 
drugs and fornicates. And to a certain 
extent, that’s all the character develop-
ment we get. He shows no remorse for 
swindling, working-class people out 
of their money to make his own; he 
shows no guilt for treating women like 
blow-up dolls; he’s impressive in how 
intensely immoral and inhuman he is.

But think about what that means 
for us, the viewers. We go into the 
movie with some pre-existing notions 
that financiers are a generally immor-
al, greedy bunch. In the movie, we 
see some spectacular immorality and 
greed orchestrated by a character so 
uninhibited by anything resembling a 
conscience that few, if any, of us can 
connect with him. We walk out of the 
movie with our suspicions confirmed: 
Financiers are absolute douches. More 
importantly, we walk out of the film 
with a reinforced separation between 
bankers and ourselves. They are them; 
we are us.

This sense of otherness created 
in “Wolf ” has two effects, neither 
of which I think is good for society. 
One is that normal people have an 
excuse to not understand the finan-
cial sector. If finance is the realm 
of the “other,” it doesn’t deserve the 
same attention as the world of “us.” 
That’s dangerous because the world 
of finance is inextricably linked to 
our economic, and thus general, well 
being, and what we don’t know can, 
and probably will, hurt us.

The second effect is the isolation 
of financiers themselves. The carica-
turization of them as greedy pricks 
with no conscience not only makes 
us think they are different from us 
but also makes them think they are 
different from us. And, at least par-
tially, that’s what caused the financial 
crash: people thinking that the rules 
governing the rest of us didn’t apply 
to them. “Wolf ” reinforces that same 
kind of thinking. 

You can argue that art’s job is not 
to solve society’s problems, but does 
it really have to exacerbate them? 
Couldn’t we ask of art that it confront 
those fault lines threatening society? 
Not to bridge those gaps, but, by 
humanizing the “other,” simply to nar-
row that gap a little bit.

LIFESTYLE@UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

E very year, when January comes around, people become suddenly inspired, sure that this is the year when they’ll finally turn their lives around. Often, the larger-than-life goals we set for ourselves fail almost imme-diately. The main cause of this failure is that we try to make changes before we’re ready, and we attempt to 
change our lives in implausible ways. Usually, the changes are no fun — they require an undesirable, seemingly 
insurmountable level of effort, and the payoff seems far away. As the end of January approaches, and as we start to 
second-guess our New Year’s ambitions, now’s the time to find a way to set small, reasonable, rewarding goals that 
suit our abilities and won’t give us sky-high expectations. Here’s the UCSD Guardian’s take on what you may have 
done wrong and, more importantly, what you can do differently.

THE PROBLEM: You set the bar too high.
THE SOLUTION: Lower the bar.
Resolutions that are made on a “go big or go home” 
basis are rarely successful, unless you have a crazy 
amount of discipline. Baby steps are the best way to 
achieve success. For example, rather than resolving 
to run six miles every day, when you can’t stand 
running, try running a mile and taking the stairs 
instead of the elevator. This doesn’t mean that you 
are weak or not challenging yourself enough; it 
is just adjusting your lifestyle to make your goals 
achievable. 

THE PROBLEM: Change is hard.
THE SOLUTION: To make change less brutal, reward 
yourself every once in a while.
Yes, change is hard. But, much like smoking, you 
don’t just quit things cold turkey. Change is gradual 
and requires perspective. Try to set goals that suit 
your personality and give you time to adjust to 
change. For example, instead of trying to give up 
fast food all together, allow yourself a treat one day 
a week.  

THE PROBLEM: Everything takes too long.
THE SOLUTION: Be patient.
Listen, change is not going to happen overnight. Accept 
the fact that in order to see results, things take time. 
Instead of freaking out that you haven’t found a job in 
your field yet, take that job at the coffee shop and keep 
looking for another job. Don’t sit around feeling sorry 
for yourself because no one is hiring recent graduates 
for your dream job. Be patient and keep applying for 
jobs and internships. These things take time, but be 
persistent and you’ll be sure to find an alternative way 
to get the experience you need for the future. 

THE PROBLEM: You change your mind too often.
THE SOLUTION: Accept that, sometimes, goals 
change.
You don’t need to choose one goal and stick with it. 
It’s OK to change your mind and try something else. 
Change is not limited to the month of January. It’s OK to 
decide you hate computer science and switch to theater, 
as long as you fully think it through. College is a good 
time to change your mind — just don’t develop chronic 
indecisiveness.

THE PROBLEM: You didn’t make any resolutions.
THE SOLUTION: Have a good year, anyway.
The practice of making New Year’s resolutions is meant to help us set quantifiable goals, but it often turns into 
an obligatory period in which we set hollow expectations that we won’t reasonably achieve. Don’t be mad at 
yourself for not setting out to make any drastic changes in your life. Instead of getting caught up in making 
resolutions, just try and live your life in a balanced way, and be open to new opportunities as they arise. And 
most importantly, have a happy 2014!

BEST NEW ARTIST

J ames Blake has carved a peculiar niche in the world of popular music. Beginning 
his career primarily as a producer, 

Blake evolved, seemingly overnight, 
into an impressive singer-songwrit-

er while still maintaining an ear for 
minimalist dubstep productions. In 

the past, Blake sampled R&B artists 
Aaliyah and Kelis, chopping and 
processing their vocals into airy, 
wordless fragments that !oat over 
his tracks. Now, his own vocals 
are sampled and reworked, o"en 
following alongside his singing. 
It’s both foreign and familiar, a 
wonderful mix of engrossing pop 
and challenging dubstep. #is 
combination has been seen before 
with electronic producer SBTRKT 
and his collaborations with singer 
Jessie Ware, but none have made 
music as emotive and arresting as 
Blake, whose music displays his 
concurrent in!uences from soul 
and R&B.

While he may have initially 
been written o$ as a passing fad, 
Blake has proven to be a multi-
faceted and in!uential force in 
music. Having released two, full-
length albums and %ve EPs since 
2011, he is certainly one of the 
most proli%c new artists. It’s pos-
sible that Blake will, as many have, 
burn out too quickly, but so far, 
each of his new works has added 
new dimensions to his music, 
constant evolution and progres-
sion. James Blake isn’t just one of 
the best new artists — he’s one of 
the best around.

E ntering into music at just 17, pop singer Lorde is now nominated 
for four Grammys, including 

Record of the Year, in which 
“Royals” is favored to win. If she 

receives the Grammy for this 
category, she will be the youngest 
ever to do so. #e song’s stripped 

down, hollow sound, carried by 
the smooth backbeat of snapping 
%ngers and the hushing buzz of the 
synthesizer, spotlights the singer’s 
crooning, throaty vocals.

Together, Lorde and producer 
Joel Little have produced a song 
that pops the bubble of the fantasy 
“life of luxury” so o"en detailed in 
mainstream music, dispelling the 
unrealities of “Cristal, Maybach, 
diamonds on your timepiece.” Au-
to-tune is not necessary to improve 
the simultaneous youthful naivete 
and old soul mourning apparent in 
Lorde’s voice.

Lorde is a newbie in a category 
with many high-pro%le nominees, 
including Da" Punk, Imagine 
Dragons, Bruno Mars and Robin 
#icke , which displays her incredi-
ble ability. But “Royals” has become 
such a popular youth anthem — it’s 
been certi%ed platinum four times 
and topped the “Billboard Hot 
100” for nine consecutive weeks      
— that its mass appeal, along with 
Lorde’s fresh sound, may earn it 
the win. It is Lorde’s minimalism 
amid the louder, busier sounds 
of her competitors that gives “Roy-
als” its more powerful edge in the 
Record of the Year race.

F or a song that deals with weighty themes like same-sex marriage 
and religious discrimination, 
“Same Love” treads lightly, adri" 
on so", choral hums and meander-
ing piano that settle atop a sway-
ing backbeat. #e simplicity of it all 
complements the message perfectly; 
such a controversial issue just boils down 
to plain, old love. #e lyrics themselves 
speak eloquently and unabashedly on behalf 
of same-sex relationships, with well-penned 
lines like, “#e right-wing conservatives think 
it’s a decision / And you can be cured with 
some treatment and religion / Man-made rewir-
ing of a predisposition,” hammering the point 
home easily. Mary Lambert — who’s performing 
at #e Lo" on Jan. 28 — contributes a heartbreak-
ing hook that croons, “I can’t change, even if I try.” 
Overall, “Same Love” deserves the win for being a 
complete package. #e cutting lyrics and layered 
production work seamlessly and without preten-
sion toward addressing a vital source of discrimi-
nation in our society. More than that, the song 
stands up against discrimination even within its 
own genre, pressing hard for a national mentality 
change.

H aving been crowned the “New King of the West Coast” by fel-low California rappers Snoopzilla, 
formally known as Snoop Dogg; Dr. Dre 

and #e Game, 26-year-old Kendrick Lamar 
acknowledges the title in the concept album 

“good kid, m.A.A.d. city” by evoking a time 
and a place: his adolescence in Compton. 

Although critics have continuously 
praised him, Lamar is no bragger. He’s a 

conscious rapper whose expertise lies in 
his captivating storytelling. #e %rst track 

transports the listener to a “house party 
on El Segundo and Central.” What fol-

lows is a 68-minute journey down Rose-
crans Avenue and Alondra Boulevard 

through the town that made him. 
Lamar has a complicated relation-

ship with his hometown. Plagued by 
existential vertigo, he tells his coming-
of-age story — a soliloquy on religion, 
drugs and alcohol, the violence of 
gang culture and the grounding 
power of family. Lamar expertly takes 
on the role of observer and reporter. 
He morphs his writing style, rhythm 
of delivery and even his voice to %t 
di$erent contexts, enforcing the 
cinematic aspect of the album (the 
cover refers to it as a short %lm). 
#e result is an incredibly cohesive 
album that never becomes !at or 
repetitious. With samples ranging 
from Janet Jackson to Beach House, 
it is a kaleidoscopic music experi-
ence, featuring producers like Just 
Blaze, Pharrell Williams, T-Minus, 
as well as Lamar’s mentor Dre.

O n the day of their lat-est album release concert, Elizabeth and the Catapult 
updated their Facebook page with 
the status, “To all who came out 
to my show on a snow day[,] ...[t]
hanks for giving a big ol’ middle 
finger to the weatherman.” Beyond 
social media, the Catapult is known 
for their sassy and delightfully 
irreverent attitude in their own 
music, established in their 2009 
debut “Taller Children,” which 
poked fun at everything from exes 
to the economy. Even after a move 
to a label-less, independent fron-
tier, the band is still going strong 
on both sonic and lyrical fronts, 
with their latest album, “Like It 
Never Happened,” exhibiting a 
solid, sophisticated — albeit playful 
— comeback.

The majority of this new album 
features much of the usual Catapult 
faire, filled with smart lyrics, quirky 
chamber pop and sprinkles of jazz. 
Take album opener “Happy Pop,” 
whose cheery name and upbeat 
sound masks an ironic lyrical cri-
tique of the pop industry: Elizabeth 
Ziman defiantly sings, “Here’s my 
happy pop song / …It’s got no pur-
pose, got no need / …[But it can] 
make my label for once content 
with me.” In broken-fourth-wall 
fashion, not unlike Sara Bareilles’s 
“Love Song,” Ziman repeatedly 
confronts record labels’ requests for 

generic pop anthems, asking “Are 
you proud?” Aside from the band’s 
break into truly “indie” territory, 
the tongue-in-cheek track hearkens 
back to the Catapult’s comically 
mischievous repertoire.

With this newly acquired cre-
ative freedom, however, the band 
has taken some more ambitious 
strides in their new album, to posi-
tive results. “Sugared Poison” turns 
Ziman into Fiona Apple’s snarkier 
cousin: Ziman bangs away at the 
piano keys in a similar, slightly dis-
cordant style and throws a snippy 
rhetorical question at the titular 
subject, asking her lover, “Are you 
heaven or hell?” The group takes 
another venture with lead single 
“Shoelaces,” this time into ‘60s 
rock, swapping out the usual key-
boards with an addictive guitar riff 
and an earworm-inducing melody 
— it’ll be difficult not to keep hear-
ing Ziman sing, “There is more to 
come / We’ve only just begun.” How 
fitting, considering that although 
the Catapult proves that they’re a 
group of veteran musicians still 
capable of composing one strong 
LP after another, they’re just begin-
ning to explore new ground. “But 
waiting’s everything,” and it’ll be 
worth that wait.

"Like  It  Never  Happened" 
by  Elizabeth  and  the  Catapult

Release Date Jan. 21

Brooklyn-based indie pop band shoots back onto 
the music scene with its third full-length offering.

ALBUM  REVIEW I t’s been a big week for the frontwoman of Elizabeth and the Catapult. Just a day before releasing her third album “Like It Never Happened,” Elizabeth Ziman made her 
cinematic debut at Sundance in “Song One,” starring her 
famous fan, Anne Hathaway. We asked Ziman about her 
big week, her role in last year’s Oscars and her artistic idol 
(hint: it’s not a musician!).

G: Anne Hathaway used 
your song “Thank You for 
Nothing” whilst filming 
her iconic, Oscar-winning 
hair-cutting scene in “Les 
Miserables.” What was 
your reaction when you 
first heard about this?
EZ: I thought it was very 
random! My first thought 
was, “That’s incredible. 
How on earth has she 
heard of my music?” It 
was definitely a surprise. 
… [After that,] I was 
called in for an audition 
that I didn’t know what 
it was for [except] that it 
had something to do with 
a movie about musicians. 
I went in and I played a 
song on my guitar that I 
had been busking with. 
And then I realized as 
the audition progressed 
that I was auditioning 
for Anne Hathaway’s 
husband [producer 
Adam Shulman]. Anne 
Hathaway’s starring in a 
film [called “Song One”] 
about New York City 
musicians. … I think that 
was her way of saying 
thank you. I had the last scene that they were shooting for 
the movie. It was in the middle of the night, and she gave 
me a big hug. It was very sweet.

G: Who are your greatest influences?
EZ: If I’m just going to be completely honest, I have to say 
[Woody Allen]. It’s funny because I saw him for the first 
time in person the other day at Carole King’s new musical 
that she just put out, … and Woody Allen was walking in 
right before me! … I grew up on Minetta Lane and right 

around the corner is Cafe Wha? where Joni Mitchell, Bob 
Dylan, Richard Dryer and Woody Allen all had their start. 
I was listening to a lot of comedy albums as I was growing 

up, and I was always really 
into Woody Allen’s mov-

ies and the scores for his 
films, so he’s number 
one. … [For musi-
cians,] I’m a really big 
of Nina Simone; I’ve 
been listening to her 
earlier recordings, a lot 
of her classical impro-
visations. … Maybe 

my biggest influence of 
contemporary musi-
cians would probably 
Rufus Wainwright or St. 
Vincent.

G: You have one of 
the most involved, per-
sonal and funniest social 
media presences out 
there. How do you think 
artists should use tech-
nology and social media 
to reach out to fans? 
How has it helped you as 
an artist?
EZ: It’s helped me a lot; 
I think the basis of my 
audience right now is a 
product of me sharing 
a lot on Facebook and 
on Twitter over the last 
few years. … I think 
people just have a really 
short attention span 
these days, and it’s really 
expensive to put records 
out, so if you can record 

as much as is humanly possible of things that you’re proud 
of, and maybe put out singles when you can, between 
records, and just make as much live content as possible 
and stay really open with your fans, I think it can only help 
you. I think it’s the one free way that you can have a leg-up 
today. Other than touring, you just create, write and share.

Q&A
ELIZABETH AND THE CATAPULT

?



Dear Editor,
I read your interesting wish list 

for the university. I as a physician, 
an employer of hundreds of people, 
a father of college kids, a husband 
and citizen would have said the fol-
lowing about your priority list.

It touches on none of the core 
issues of problems in education 
today. I have interviewed hundreds 
of young people just out of college 
and graduate school for work. Many 
are from the most elite institutions. 
In general I’m impressed by their 
deep ignorance in vast areas. They 
come to me highly unprepared in 
many ways to work and act as good 
American citizens. Rather than 
focus on campus lighting and the 
food court, here is a priority list you 
might consider.

Prioritize learning American val-
ues instead of leftist ones. In so doing, 
learn about what made this country 
great and brought more dignity and 
wealth to more people than any other 
value system in the world. Learn that 
our founders were incredibly wise 
despite their human faults and gave 
us the precious ideas of freedom over 
equality, small government and big 
people, a Constitution to be revered 
and followed as written and free mar-
ket capitalism. 

Learn that the value system of 
leftism with its focus on race, class 
and gender, wealth redistribution and 
socialism is very old school, gener-
ally immoral and very destructive 
to our freedoms, virtue and wealth. 
Prioritize reading clearly and thor-
oughly things like our Constitution, 
the Federalist Papers, the Anti-
Federalist Papers, the Bible, Milton 
[Friedman’s] “Free to Choose” and 
[Hayek’s] “Road to Serfdom.”  

Prioritize learning about how pro-

gressivism and leftism have radically 
undermined our American value sys-
tem, how it came from Europe from 
people like Karl Marx and has harmed 
every society it has touched. Prioritize 
learning the deep practicalities of life 
like basic economics and finance, 
where our money comes from and 
goes to, how businesses are built, 
why is the structure and meaning of 
our vast entitlement programs like 
Medicare and Social Security are in 
many ways unethical and unconstitu-
tional and why overreaching govern-
ment power harms our fundamental 
freedoms and wealth creation. 

Prioritize learning how the wool 
is being pulled over your eyes with 
leftism building up a vast entitle-
ment state that cannot survive and 
will harm you terribly economi-
cally and spiritually. That is what I 
would prioritize — not nicer selec-
tions on the food court line.

Check out things like Prager 
University on line: I pay my kids 
to watch these five-minute gems 
on American values. Each is worth 
exponentially more than the leftism 
you get at our schools for vast sums 
of hard earned money. Have people 
like him speak at your school to 
push against the narrowness and 
rigidity of thought now prevalent 
on our campuses.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

What the Guardian 
Should Have Wished for

time with their families. Given the 
costs and time associated with travel-
ing, two weeks is simply not enough. 
And it’s not like the extra week tacked 
on to an already lengthy summer is 
very useful; most summer jobs and 
internships are shaped toward semes-
ter system schools, leaving us to spend 
September lying around with nothing 
to do. If the administration is bent on 
a radical calendar change, starting the 
school year earlier, rather than later, 
could prevent cutting a week from our 
winter break.

This rather impulsive move is 
also indicative of the UC system’s 
tendency to keep students out of the 
loop on major changes in our schools. 

In 2011, for example, the Universities 
of California made a top-down deci-
sion to overhaul the health insurance 
system, taking no student voices into 
account. The third-party manage-
ment firm that the UC system hired 
to calculate the per-student cost of 
healthcare under-budgeted the cost, 
plunging the nine campuses into $57 
million of debt in a mere three years. 
UCSD alone carries $21 million of 
that amount. This indicates a clear 
pattern of administration making rash 
decisions with harsh consequences, 
and it’s becoming a pattern we’re wor-
ryingly familiar with seeing.

The academic calendar change 
is no different from the SHIP disas-
ter. Though the two-week break is 
an anomaly for Winter Break 2014 

(since the Jewish calendar is different 
every year) and will not necessarily be 
implemented in each year to follow, 
we wish that there could have been 
more student input before the deci-
sion was made. Even a representative 
of the Union of Jewish Students at 
UCSD told the UCSD Guardian that 
Jewish students were neither asked 
about nor informed of the change 
until the news was released. 

Although we appreciate admin-
istrators’ efforts to accommodate 
students with religious conflicts, 
there are better, less disruptive ways 
for the UC system to do so. Cutting 
short the precious days of winter 
break for thousands of students across 
the Universities of California never 
should have been an option.

Eventually, the Aggies would 
capitalize on such a rush, scoring 
at about eight minutes on a two-
on-one breakaway. Shortly after, the 
Tritons would respond twice with 
goals coming from Curdes off a wrist 
shot — his first in three games — 
and senior forward Benjamin Song.

Frustration set in as the Tritons 
piled up attempts on goal without 
any results. UC Davis goalkeeper 
Niklas Braun remained strong, 
keeping the game within one despite 
his team’s unimpressive defense. But 
with 2.9 seconds left, the Aggies 
scored off a rebound to tie the game 
at 6–6.

The Tritons forced contact right 
from the start, generating chances 
from the relatively undefended slot. 

Eight minutes into the period, 
offensive catalyst Curdes scored his 

second goal to beat Braun. 
The Aggies defense was unable 

to cope with the fast-moving Triton 
offense and would allow another goal 
during four-on-four play following 
an altercation behind UCSD’s goal.

As tensions rose, the hits became 
harder and the play faster, but Davis 
eventually succumbed to UCSD’s 
dominant neutral zone play and 
swift passing offense. Curdes netted 
the final goal of the game, marking 
his second hat trick of the year. 

UCSD will now play its final 
two games against Cal Lutheran 
and Chapman, both away games, 
before taking several weeks off 
to prepare for the Collegiate Ice 
Hockey Association conference 
championships which, Curde says, 
will require disciplined play to win.

Tritons its first run in the third 
inning, with freshman right-fielder 
Christian Leung managing the same 
in the fourth. Two errors by the 
Hawks gave UCSD the other two tal-
lies to close out the game.

Against No. 16 ranked Cal State 
San Marcos, UCSD managed three 
runs in the first two innings but 
pulled far ahead of the Cougars in the 
third by scoring nine runs on six hits. 
The Tritons racked up 13 hits against 
the Cougars with seniors Justin Rahn 
and Spencer Frazier, junior Erik 
Lewis and Leung each contributing 
two hits to Cruz’s four.

Against San Diego Christian, 
UCSD stranded 10 batters despite 

a great defensive performance, and 
Newman noted the Tritons’ improve-
ment against Cal State San Marcos.

“I definitely saw a team from our 
standpoint, where we took to heart 
the things that we saw in the first 
game, and we worked on it a lot,” 
Newman said after the game.

Pitching continues to be a focal 
point for the Tritons’ success, as 
sophomore Justin Donatella started 
on the mound against the Cougars 
and struck out six hitters across four 
full innings.

UCSD softball, one of the most 
successful teams in the university’s 
history, is set to start the 2014 season 
next Saturday, Feb. 1, kicking off an 
18-game homestand.

Coming off a 2013 season that was 
cut short at the NCAA West Regional 
finals, UCSD returns nine starters. 
Senior catcher Caitlin Brown, a NCAA 
West Regional selection, will be behind 
the plate again this season, along with 
2013 All-California Collegiate Athletic 
Association selections senior out-
fielders Kirsten Willmon and Taylor 
Sepulveda and senior shortstop Mya 
Romero. Seniors third-base Emily 
McQuaid and right-handed pitcher 
Jennifer Manuel will also be back on 
the diamond with sophomores short-

stop Mckenna Clewett, third-base 
Callie Grant and utility Amani Proctor.

“I think we’re going to do well this 
year,” Brown said. “We have a lot of 
returners and freshmen who are eager 
to do well.”

Though UCSD graduates All-
CCAA first team selection first base-
man Nicole Spangler, as well as out-
fielder Dyanna Imoto, the Tritons have 
brought on some exciting new addi-
tions. Five freshmen will join the team, 
and two former UCSD All-Americans, 
Camille Gaito and Kris Lesovsky, will 
serve on the coaching staff.

“All the freshmen are doing pretty 
well right now,” Brown said. “[Bianca 
Devoto] is an infielder who is great at 
bat; [Ashley Chestnut] is a power hit-
ter, which is something we need in the 
lineup right now. [Emma Schneider] 
was hurt last year, but she’s going to 

be one of our strongest hitters, and 
[Alayna Brenman] is a pitcher who 
will probably get a lot of innings.”

Last week, UCSD played its only 
exhibition game against Concordia 
University. The Tritons lost 4–3, but 
Brown said they feel ready to start the 
regular season.

“We’re confident in where we’re 
going right now,” Brown said. “We 
have two more weeks before we start 
conference, and I think we’re happy 
where we are and happy with the 
improvement we’ve made since last 
fall.”

The Tritons kick off the regular 
season with a four-game series against 
Western Oregon University from Feb. 
1 to Feb. 2. UCSD begins conference 
play Feb. 14 against Chico State.

UCSD Club Hockey 
Wins 10th Straight Game

HOCKEY

Club hockey defeated the Aggies 9–6 in its last home 
game of the season, as the Tritons prepare for playoffs.

The UCSD club hockey team faced 
UC Davis last Friday at the Westfield 
Shoppingtown UTC Ice Rink, beating 
the Aggies 9–6 to extend its streak to 
10 games.  

From the first drop of the puck, the 
Tritons came out swinging, eager to 
win its final home game of the regular 
season. 

Despite struggling initially in 
clearing their defensive zone, the 
Tritons scored two goals in the first 13 
seconds on Davis goalie Niklas Braun. 

The Aggies rebounded right back, 
settling in their attacking zone and 
putting up three quick goals on UCSD 
senior goaltender Ryan Corriveau, 
including a power play goal off of a 
UCSD tripping minor. 

UCSD put up a strong forecheck 

and won brutal loose-puck battles 
along the boards allowing UCSD 
to score two more goals in the first 
period. But Davis would once again 
answer back, scoring off a three-on-
two breakaway to tie the score at 4–4 
to end the first period.

As the second period started 
Davis was stagnant on the power play 
and was unable to capitalize before 
receiving its own penalty.

Neutral zone play continued as the 
focal point of the game in the second 
period with both teams going on odd-
man rushes, failing to keep possession 
on the forecheck and letting the puck 
meander to center ice. 

“The trick this game was to 
backcheck hard and make sure you’re 
picking up a guy. That helped us shut 
them down,” sophomore forward Zane 
Curdes said.

UCSD Dominates

The Tritons knocked in 23 total runs 
in wins over San Diego Christian 

and Cal State San Marcos.

The UCSD baseball team kicked off its slate of exhibition games with 
a 4–0 victory over San Diego Christian College last Friday night at Triton 
Ballpark. Following the shutout over SDCC, the Tritons trounced Cal 
State San Marcos Tuesday, Jan. 21, 19–0 with a standout 4-for-4 perfor-
mance with three runs, one run batted in and one walk by sophomore 
two-way player Troy Cruz.

On Jan. 17, against San Diego Christian, UCSD head coach Eric 
Newman rotated through four pitchers, who collectively allowed just two 
hits through nine frames.

Junior right-hander Dan Kolodin started on the mound for the 
Tritons and threw three no-hit innings including five strikeouts. Kolodin 
was followed by a two-inning performance from sophomore right-hander 
Adrian Orozco, junior southpaw Trevor Scott and senior right-hander 
Blake Fassler — who all recorded two strikeouts apiece. The Tritons’ 
pitching performance was highlighted by Fassler sending back all six bat-
ters he faced and making a quick grab off of San Diego Christian’s Luke 
Brando for the final out.

“Our pitching and defense performed really well,” Newman said. “Our 
pitchers attacked hitters with good pace. They controlled the game and 
kept our tempo.
