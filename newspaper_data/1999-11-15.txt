TOKYO - After Ana Bortz 
arrived from Brazil six years ago, 
she - like many foreigners who 
live here - grew used to the 
countless means employed by the 
Japanese to enforce distinctions 
between themselves and others. 

But what Ms. Bortz, 35, a 
reporter for a Brazilian satellite 
television network, said she had 
not been prepared for was being 
escorted out of a jewelry store in 
Hamamatsu City, where she lives, 
because the store's owners, as 
they stated adamantly, had a pol-

The decision, a mutual agree-

Marathon Raises Funds 
CHARITY: Wheelchair basketball played in Main Gym for 24 hours 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Guardian Reporter 

Twenty-four teams ~ompet­
ed in the First Annual 24-hour 
Wheelchair Basketball Mara-
thon Saturday and Sunday. The 
marathon featured San Diego's 
team XPress competing against 
the UCSD men's and women's 
basketball teams and other 
local teams to promote disabili-
ty awareness and help raise 
money for XPress and Sharp 
Rehabilitation. 

The event was organized by 
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity and 
the UCSD Disabled Students 
Union. 

Dan Altan, a member of the 
XPress team and event organiz-

er, said the marathon allows 
people to appreciate the diffi-
culties disabled students expe-
rience. 

Altan also said spinal cord 
injury is the most common dis-
ability among his teammates. 
Other players have had head 
injuries, polio and spina bifida. 

The XPress team, which 
competes against teams nation-
wide, is part of Sports Limited, 
a non-profit organization of San 
Diego County. 

All players competed in 
wheelchairs during the tourna-
ment. Standard basketball rules 
remained the same, except that 
players were allowed four sec-
onds in the key instead of three, 
and two pushes of their wheel-

chairs for every bounce of the 
ball. 

The Xpress team won each 
of the games it played in this 
weekend's 24-hour marathon. 

XPress player Pat Nellans 
said that playing against vari-
ous organizations is a good 
way to promote disability 
awareness. 

"The game shows we're not 
SO different than anybody else," 
he said. "We participate in the 
same events as anybody else."

Union Chair Randy Bimkrant 
agreed.

Parade 
Honors 
Veterans 
HOUDAY: Organizers 
said those who served 
deserve more recognition 
By PARISA JADE BAHARIAN 
Guardian Reporter 

The United Veterans Council 's 
Veterans Day parade brought vet-
erans, middle and high school 
students and the citizens of San 
Diego together for a day of 
remembrance in downtown San 
Diego last Thursday. 

Over 2,000 people lined the 
streets to honor and support San 
Diego veterans who sacrificed to 
protect the liberlles of a ll 
Americans. 

The United Veterans Council 
said the parade featured over 
2,000 veterans and 112 groups, 
including many local school 
bands. 

The parade began at 11 a.m. at 
the County Administration 
Building and ended at 1:30 p.m. 
in Seaport Village. The theme of 
this year's parade was "100 Years 
of U.s. Navy Submarine Service." 

U.S. Navy Retired Master 
Chief Joe W. Brunner, the parade 
chairman, said that at the tum of 
the 20th century, submarines 
were dangerous and untested, yet 
never lacked volunteers. Brunner 
said that although the U.S. Navy 
lost 52 submarines during World 
War II, the United States still 
dominated over the Japanese. 

Brunner also said that the 
Cold War never turned into a full-
fledged war because Russia did 
not know the locations of U.S. 
submarines loaded with nuclear 
weapons. 

Leading the parade was a 
national organization known as 
Submarine Veterans of World War 
II, and a local group called 
Submarine Veterans Incorporated. 

Brunner said the parade not

UCSD Scientists Melt Material Without Heat 
RESEARCH: For the fIrst time, an international team used light and X-rays to observe the transfonnation 
By PETE PRATO 
Guardian Reporter 

An international team of sci-
entists working in UCSD's chem-
istry and biochemistry depart-
ment used pulses of light and X-
rays to observe the melting of 
material, bypassing the tradi-
tional method of melting an 
object by heating it. 

Andrea Cavalieri, one of the 
study's authors said that the 
study could lead to develop-
ments in the electronic and 
telecommunication industries. 

The scientists altered the struc-

lure of a semi-conductive materi-
al in such a way that it passed 
from an ordered symmetrical 
crystal structure to a disordered 
liquid state and back again. 

The traditional process of 
thermal melting that the scien-
tists bypassed is an ordinary, 
everyday occurrence and can be 
demonstrated by a glass of water 
with an ice cube in it. 

The scientists used ultra-fast 
pulses of lasers to create intense 
forces on the crystal's atoms. 
These forces caused the crystal to 
pass directly from a cold solid to 
a hot liquid without ever going 

through the classic equilibrium 
stage of a hot solid. 

While the pulses of laser light 
pushed the electrons of the solid 
into an extremely excited state, 
the scientists used X-rays to 
observe the entire process, some-
thing that has not been achieved 
until now. 

The study is described in the 
Nov. 12 issue of the scientific 
journal Science. 

Cavalieri explained the 
process. 

"During classic melting, atoms 
become hotter, vibrate and pop 
out of their positions," Cavalieri 

stated. "In the case of non-ther-
mal melting, the short laser pulse 
neutralizes the glue that keeps 
atoms in a crystal and they are 
instantaneously freed, regardless 
of the vibrations. The initial and 
final [states) are the same as in 
traditional melting, but the path-
way is very different." 

This alternate pathway has 
been pursued for almost two 
decades now, mainly because of 
the desire to explore many fun-
damental processes in nature, 
including problems in physics,

A CASE FOR CAPITALISM 
Microsoft monopoly ruling hurts consumers, 
and it only helps competing companies 
By PAR/SA JADE BAHARIAN 
Staff Writer 

Federal Judge Thomas Jackson's ruling 
that Microsoft is a monopoly sets a danger-
ous precedent of governmental interference 
with business. Jackson's 207-page finding 
that Microsoft is a monopoly that uses "its 
prodigious market power and immense 
profits to harm" its competitors is flawed . 

Judge Jackson also concluded that 
Microsoft's business practices have 
"harmed consumers in ways that are imme-
diate and easily dis-
cernible." 

and equal chance? It is survival of the 
fittest, and right now, Microsoft is the 
fittest company in the software industry. 
In a free economy, a dominant poSition 
can only be maintained by providing 
products that are superior to other compa-
nys' products. Microsoft has maintained 
its superior position by continually inno-
vating its products in order to keep con-
sumer satisfaction high. 

Yet Microsoft's innovation, its contin-
ual product upgrades and the millions of 
dollars it spends on research and devel-

opment are what 

Wait a second. Has 
Microsoft actually 
harmed us, the con-
sumers? Does he mean to 
say that the Microsoft 
Word software I'm using 
right now isn't beneficial 
to me? Is it a crime to cre-

con 
Jackson pounced upon 
as evidence of a conspir-
acy to stifle its competi-
tors, and cited it as proof 
that the Sherman 
Antitrust Act was violat-
ed. GUAROIAN OPINION The Sherman Anti-
trust Act wasn't enacted 
to protect a company's ate better and more use-

ful software? The reason I 
bought Microsoft Word 
was because I wanted the 
best, most efficient soft-
ware. 

Yet jackson's claim 
that Microsoft harmed 
consumers by giving 
away its Web browser is 
ab olutely ridiculous. 
Who wouldn't want to 
receive a free product? 
And if for some reason

competitors. It was creat-
ed to protect the con-
sumers from monopo-
lies. And Microsoft does 
not fit the definition of a 
monopoly. 

As Bill Gates so elo-
quently explained before 
the Senate, "Microsoft 
does not have monopoly 
power in the business of 
developing and licensing 

the consumers didn't want to use 
Microsoft Internet Explorer, they could 
jllst install the browser they preferred and 
SImply not lise their free gift. Microsoft's 
practice was consume r friendly, yet 
Jackson believes that this constitutes 
"monopoly power" used to "coerce" its 
cllstomers? I don't think so. 

The true intent of this antitrust suit 
stems from the fact that the government is 
prosecuting Microsoft jn the interests of 
the scorned computer and Internet com-
panies who ca n' t deal with being inferior 
to Microsoft. Attorney General Janet Reno 
saId MIcrosoft 's behavior has had the 
effect of "impairing the ability of 
Microsoft's competitors to obtain financ-
Ing fo r research and development." Who 
ever promIsed everyone in business a fair 

computer operating soft-
ware, [for) a monopoly by definition is a 
company that has the ability to restrict 
entry by new firms and unilaterally con-
trol price. Microsoft can do neither." 

All Microsoft has done is to make the 
best products possible at a price that con-
sumers are willing to pay. Consumers buy 
Microsoft's products because they are the 
best on the market and because they can 
get quality software with a free Internet 
browser all in one package. Microsoft's 
practice of "bundling" its Internet access 
with its software actually benefits the con-
sumer, contrary to the Justice 
Department's argument. 

All the benefits the consumer receives 
from Microsoft will be put on the chopping

Sponsorship'Desecrates Graduation Ladies Like Men 
Who Take Initiative COMMENTARY: Graduation is students' time to shine, not time for greed By KIM HOOPER 

Staff Writer 

Graduation. You have been 
awaiting the day for years: the 
cap and gown, flowers from 
mom and dad, the diploma, the 
promise of a successful future 
free of midterms and final 
exams. It is one of those sacred 
events in your life, steeped in 
tradition and dignity. So, when I 
recently heard that (JCSD is con-
sidering corporate sponsorship 
for its graduation ceremony, I 
was nothing less than horrified. 

My imagination went wild as 
I envisioned "Pomp and 
Circumstance" playing, only to 
be interrupted part way through 
by an announcer who, in the 
style of a radio personality, 
declares, "The Class of 2000! 
Brought to you by ... (you fill in 
the blank)." 

There is a sick feeling in my 
stomach, a sense of being cheat-
ed somehow, as I imagine a page 
in the graduation program dedi-
cated to a corporate sponsor. A 
page hopelessly out of place, a 
page that exemplifies this ' dis-
gusting invasion of the modern 
media. 

These days it's nearly impos-
sible to avoid advertising. Not 
long ago, there were yellow ban-
ners advertising ABC outside of 
Center Hall. Sporting events are 
tainted with advertisemel"'ts for 
soft drinks and cereal. 

While you're stuck in a traffic 
jam on the freeway, there is an 
endless string of conveniently 
placed billboards to keep you 
company. Waiting at the bus 
stop, companies place ads hop-

ing to take advantage of your 
immobility to promote their 
product. 

We have all grown up in this 
environment of media overkill, 
and have learned to overlook the 
advertisemf'nts that we deem 
unimportant. We throwaway 
"junk mail" because it is exactly 
that-junk. 

We are bombarded with so 
many' U messages from the spon-
sors' that we have accepted 
them as part of our world and 
learned to ignore them. We make 
trips to the refrigerator during 
television commercials or run to 
the bathroom during the pre-
preview ads in movie theaters. 

There are certain aspects of 
our society that are infested with 
sponsorship, certain forums that 
would appear naked without it. 
I can accept that, despite the 
annoyance it entails. But, gradu-
ation? 

The co",ept of a sponsored 
. graduation leaves the same bit-
ter taste in my mouth as the idea 
of a sponsored wedding or 
funeral. Just as I could not con-

Company X, I now pronounce 
you man and wife: I cannot 
condone the name of a company 
being linked to my degree, as if 
that company played any role in 
those all-nighters I pulled to in 
order to get to the graduation 
stage. 

Ceremonies are special 
events that represent a brief 
respite from our fast-paced soci-
ety. They should be free of all the 
distractions that clutter our 
minds daily in the outside 
world. They should allow us to 
revel in tradition as we perform 
age-old rites of passage. 

When I watch the home video 
of graduation that my parents 
will inevitably make, I do not 
want to see a banner with some 
corporation's name behind my 
head. I do not want to have to 
explain to my friends or even my 
own children why "Company 
X" is advertising its new services 
while we throw our caps into the 
air. There is something cheap 
and unnatural about that. 

A sponsored graduation may 
bring money into UCSD, which 
would help alleviate costs, but 
the university has been able to 
conduct traditional ceremonies 
in the past, so I see no reason to 
change this policy now. 

The opportunity to cash in by 
having a company pay the uni-
versity for advertising at this 
huge event is tempting, but 
something has to be said for the 
sacred nature of ceremonies and 
the legacy of graduation.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Grades Matter Too Much to UCSD Students 
COMMENTARY: Some waste an entire lecture arguing over grading policies with professors 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

While I was having dinner 
with my parents not too long 
ago, we found occasion to com-
pare their memories of college 
with my own experiences. It 
seems that many of the things 
that annoy college students 
today were commonplace dur-
ing their college years as well: 
couples who make out in lecture 
under the assumption that no 
one else will mind, professors 
that don 't understand what a 
microphone is or what it is sup-
posed to be used for and people 
who don't seem to have time to 
bathe during finals week. 

At one pOint, I was so 
engrossed with the similarities 
between our experiences that I 
forgot whom I was talking to 
and asked, "Oon't you hate it 
when people's pagers go off in 
the middle of lecture?" This 
drew some blank looks from my 
parents. Stupid generation gap. 

In retrospect it seems we held 
this conversation a little prema-
turely. I now have a new favorite 
pet peeve: people who decide to 
use lecture as a forum for dis-
CUSSIng their grades. 

I don't mean to imply tha t a 
short dl cussion of the logistics 
of il cou r e has no place in lec-
tu re. Certainly the professor 
should explain the grading sys-
tem the first week or so of class. 
Also, a discussion of paper and 
midterm grades is appropriate 
when it comes time for them. But 
there IS no reason to turn an 
entire lecture into a deba te where 

students argue with their profes-
sors and try to wheedle a few 
concessions out of them. 

I'm not going -to say that I 
don't care about my grades, 
because that just isn' t true. But 
after four years of college I've 
realized that there are some 
people who are absolutely 
obsessed with this aspect of 
their education, and that quite a 
lot of them go to UCSD. 

On several occasions I've 
watched in ' horror as a profes-
sor spent an entire class fielding 

On average I endure at least 
one such debate in each class 
every quarter, although during 
spring quarter people tend to 
become a little bit more con-
cerned with their grades and 
make a point to bring it up more 
often. 

I am continually amazed at 
the lengths to which students 
will go to try and coerce a few 
extra percentage points out of 
their professor. Apparently I 
have grossly misjudged the 
number of students at this 

But after four years of college I've realized that there 
are some people who are absolutely obsessed with 
this aspect of their education, and that quite a lot of 
them go to UCSD. On several occasions I've 
watched in horror as a professor spent an entire 
class fielding questions on grades. 

questions on grades: How is the 
curve set? Why won't you let us 
do extra credit projects? How 
can students appeal their 
grades? What happens if we're 
half a pOint away from the next 
higher grade? Isn' t it true that 
the entire institution of letter 
grades is a Masonic plot 
designed to brainwash and sub-
juga te the student population? 

I haven't seen anyone 
putting this much effort into 
asking questions about circuit 
analysis or the economic impact 
of overseas inflation. Since no 
one seems to ha ve any ques-
tions about the course material, 
why are these people so wor-
ried about their grades? 

school who plan to pursue legal 
careers. 

I've never had the heart to 
reproach my fellow students in 
the middle of a class for this kind 
of behavior, but I have no com-
punctions about doing so in a 
public forum. 

People; this kind of behavior 
is absolutely inappropriate. It's 
disrespectful to the professors 
who have (hopefully) prepared a 
lecture for the class period, and it 
is inconsiderate of the other 
members of the class who did 
not pay large sums of money to 
the UC Regents so that they 
could sit around and listen to 
you whine about your grades. 

Let's assume you are getting 

your moriey's worth at UCSD 
(that is to say, you are taking 16 
units a quarter). You have paid 
about $1250 for 10 weeks of 
class (or even more for you 
poor souls who are not resi-
dents of California) for four 
classes, which each have three 
hours of lecture a week. That 
works out to 120 hours of lec-
ture per quarter, so we are all 
paying about $10 for every 
hour of lecture, whether we 
attend it or not. 

I don't know about the rest of 
you, but I did not agree to pay 
$10 to listen to a bunch of 
uptight students nit-pick over 
the finer points of their grades 
for more than an entire hour. I 
appreciate a lively debate every 
now and then, but I'd prefer if it 
centered on the course material 
and not some mundane class 
policy. 

This approach is also counter-
productive for those of us who 
would like to earn higher grades 
the old fashioned way: by actual-
ly learning the class material. I 
realize that the competition 
within some majors is rather cut-
throat (although I don't approve 
of that aspect of UCSD either),_ 
but no one has the right to hijack 
an entire lecture for his/her own 
agenda . 

If you have concerns about 
your grades, please just go to 
office hours. That's the appropri-
ate time to broach the subject, 
and it'll keep the professors on 
their toes. Most of them -could 
probably use some company 
during those lonely stints in their 
offices anyway. .

versity would be using us. It is 
our attendance and the atten-
dance of our friends and relatives 
that makes such an event attrac-
tive to sponsors in the first place. 
Therefore, it seems logical to me 
that we should have a say in this 
sponsorship debate. 

Some students may not care if 
there is a company logo on their 
I.D. card, or if the name of a cor-
poration is on their gown, or if 
their diploma has a catchy a.dver-
tising tag-line in the right-hand 
corner. But, most of us hold the 
ceremony in high esteem as one 
of the pure, unsullied events of 
life that are timeless. 

Sponsorship by a corporation 
would destroy that timeless qual-
ity. Suddenly, the home video 
loses some of its nostalgia as it 
becomes a sort of commercial. 
Attention is detracted away from 
what really matters - the accom-
plishments of the students earn-
ing their degrees. 

Graduation day should nqt be 
a corporate advertising opportu-
nity, but rather a day for students 
to advertise themselves and to 
take pride in the completion of 
their college careers.

confused ond thei r Its counter-
parts wi thout the preViously 
understood milndate to make the 
first move. This results in a total 
deildlock due to both sides' fear 
of rejection. 

While there may be several 
ways to get out of this impasse, 
I'm going to advocate one in par-
ticular. Let's return to the era of 
dating before the demand for 
gender equality: Boy asks girl, 
girl gives answer. Boy and girl 
date. 

Yes, I realize this gives the 
women a little less liberty. 
However, if everyone follows this 
plan faithfully, it works. The guys 
ask out the girls they like. 
Therefore, the women don't need 
to ask anyone out; if the guys like 
them, they'll ask them. It saves 
the women from having to worry 
about rejection entirely. 

Yes, this is totally unfair to the 
men. But let's face it: Gender 
equality is a myth. In the vast 
majority of cases, women still get 

stuck having the kids, taking care 
of the kids, and doing more clean-
ing, cooking and laundry. The 
men might as well try to balance 
things out by dealing with the 
pressure in the beginning of the 
relationship. 

So guys, show a II ltle bravery 
and ask out the girls you're 
attracted to; don ' t make them 
have to ask you. If you don' t ask 
us out, we'll just have to assume 
you don' t welnt us. Your loss. 

In case it isn't already painful-
ly obvious, most of the frustra-
tion in this column is aimed at a 
particular individual. If he's 
reading this (which is highly 
doubtful) and if he knows that 
I'm talking about him (which is 
even more doubtful), I have one 
thing to say to him. Boys, read 
closely: 

If you are the least bit interest-
ed in me, tell me. I'll even 
promise not to make you pay for 
everything, although the door-
opening would be nice. Just make 
some sort of a move, because I'm 
not gOi!1g to. 

To the rest of you guys: Take 
my advice and change the face of 
dating at UCSD. And please, try 
not to laugh too hard at me right 
now, I'm only human.

Computer users, even critics 
of Microsoft, generally praise the 
company's Windows operating 
system as the industry standard 
that allows programmers to 
write a variety of different soft-
ware applications for one uni-

Gordon Eubanks, the soft-

commented on the potential 
ramifications in the event that

tice department under a new 
presidential administration will

Microsoft recently increased 
its campaign donations, con-
tributing $331,000 in soft money 
and $800,000 in contributions 
already this year. Microsoft 
hopes the appeal will meet a 
more sympathetic justice 
department, preferably under a 
Republican administration. 
Microsoft helped finance the 
inaugural celebration for 
George W. Bush's second term 

Microsoft is broken up into 
smaller compames. "When vou

rea lly upset if you couldn' t plug 
your DVD player into it,' he 
said . People won' t pu t up with 
tha t kind of stuff. They wan t

But the Justice Departm6l1t 
doesn't seem to understand this 
concept - that whatever is 
more efficient will attract con-
sumers, and is therefore better 
for business and the economy. 
Joel Klein, assistant attorney 
general for antitrust matters, 
says the government will seek 
"serious remed.ial redress" for 
"harm to innovation." 
Obviously, the Justice 
Department is putting the best 
interests of Microsoft's com-
petitors first. 

Microsoft doesn' t need to be 
regulated, for it is in its best 
interests to keep its practices 

as governor. Bob Herbold, 
Microsoft's chief operating offi-
cer, is also a major fundraiser 
for the Bush 2000 presidential 
campaign in the Northwest. In 
addition, Microsoft employs 
lobbyist Haley Harbour, the for-
mer chairman of the Republican 
National Committee, to advo-
cate its interests in Washington . 

Microsoft hopes that the 
speed of technology will vastly 
surpass the speed of litigation. 
The combination of a new justice 
department and new market 
focus may increase Microsoft's 
chance of evading the legal 
noose. Winning is critical 
because this case, by legally 
exposing' its monopoly, ppens 
the possibilities for further litiga-

If the monopoly judgment

Microsoft has already agreed

business practices after a lengthy 
legal battle in 1995, yet its prac-
tices have remained monopolis-
tic. In light of this fact, the courts 
should break up Microsoft into 
multiple companies, just as 
AT&T was divided into the Baby 
Bells. Only then will "fai r, legal

Border Backup Leaves Miles of Aid 
Waiting Idly Outside Kosovo 

BLACE, Macedonia - Trucks 
are backed up fo r miles on either 
side of this narrow border post, 
blocked in a chaotic jam that is 
choking the main gateway into 
Kosovo for vital supplies of aid. 
The s ituation is a growing con-
cern fo r U.N . officials and aid 
worke rs who want to feed and 
shelter thousands of homeless 
residents of the province this 
winte r. 

While aid workers blame the 
Macedonian government for 
slowing customs and other pro-
cedures, border officials and 
Western diplomats in the 
Macedonian capital, Skopje, said 
the sheer volume of traffic and 
the lack of facilities has over-
whelmed the local authorities. 

" It has created havoc Oath for 
the delivery of food aid and for 
the delivery of shelter supplies," 
Peter Kessler, the spokesman for 
the U.N. refugee agency, told 
reporters after the blockage built 
up this past week. 

Other aid officials say they 
have been concerned for weeks 
or months about the blockage of 
aid at Blace, where, during the 
Kosovo war, hundreds of thou-
sands of fleeing Kosovo 

N'ATO military trucks and 
jeeps jostle for a place in 
line with aid convoys 
bearing everything from 
flour and cooking oil to 
building timber and 
cement. Civilians are 
bringing in heaps of 
belongings, bedding and 
clothes, trying to replace 
their household goods 
lost in the war. 

Albanians were caught in a 
squalid camp in no man's land 
while Macedonia considered 
whether to let them in. 

Today, the largest line is for 
traffic trying to enter Kosovo. 
NATO military trucks and jeeps 
jostle for a place in line with aid 
convoys bearing everything 
from flour and cooking oil to 
building timber and cement. 
Civilians are bringing in heaps 
of belongings, bedding and 
clothes, trying to replace their 
household goods lost in the war. 

Behind them stand over 10 

miles of commercial trucks, car-
rying everything a ruined coun-
try needs: plastic buckets, furni-
ture, daily staples. 

On the oth~r side of the bor-
der, some 200 trucks leaving 
Kosovo were backed up for 2 
miles. Many were empty after 
delivering goods. The drivers 
blamed the Macedonian border 
controls, but said it was not 
unusual to wait two days at the 
border. 

Macedonian police officials 
denied holding up any traffic on 
purpose and laid the blame on 
U.N. customs and border con-
trols, which are now operating 
on the Kosovo side. 

U.N. customs officials in 
Kosovo have admitted they are 
having difficulty processing 
incoming traffic qUickly enough. 
They have complained of fric-
tions between Macedonian bor-
der guards and the Greek con-
tingent of the NATO force in 
charge of the Kosovo side of the 
border - apparently a reflectioll 
of longstanding Greek-
Macedonian suspicion and 
enmity . .

JAPAN: 
Bortz denied service 
because of nationality 
Cuwtlt •• d froM PIIP 1 
nationality. 

So, setting off what may one 
day be looked back . upon as the 
Japanese equivalent of Rosa Parks' 
defiance of bus segregation in 
Montgomery, Ala., Ms. Bortz took 
on the discrimination against for-
eigners in Japan's courts, and to 
the surprise of many, including 
herself, she won. 

Monday, November 15, 1999 

"This was an illegal act 
against an individual," ruled 
Tetsuro So, a Shizuoka district 
court judge, who cited Japan's 
treaty obligation last month in 
awarding Ms. Bortz 547,000 in 
damages. "Ejecting the plaintiff 
from the store merely because she 
was a Brazilian was unfair." 

Because. the judgment waS 
based on international law, it can-
not be appealed under Japanese 
law. 

The store owner, Takahisa 
Suzuki, has not been giving inter-
views. In court he said that he 

had asked Ms. 
"This sort of 

thing is a very big 
problem in Japan, 
but its discussion 
has remained 
taboo," Ms. Bortz 
said. 

More than the 
victory of an indi-
vidual, the Bortz 
case is already

being seen by many foreigners 
grappling with the legal system 
here as an invaluable precedent 
in their antidiscrimination strug-
gl . 

In the absence of Japanese 
laws covering the treatment of 
foreigners, the judge in the Bortz 
case said that the country must 
abide by its international treaties 
benning discrimination. 

If the Bortz case 
stands out as the lone break-
through for now, it comes as a 
wave of challenges is being 
brought by foreigners who feel 
that if they can do nothing about 
the famous Japanese standoffish-
ness toward outsiders, they can 
at least insist on equal treatment 
before the law.

Bill Clinton Named 
Most -Traveled President 

Jobs Improve for the Disabled 
ANKARA, Turkey - As a can-

didate in 1992, Bill Clinton criti-
cized President George Bush for 
excessive globe-trotting. But in 
his nearly seven years in office, 
Clinton has taken more foreign 
trips, spent more time overseas 
and assembled larger and costlier 
entourages than any previous 
president. 

He has been to summit meet-
ings, and seen big game in 
Botswana. He has held tete-a-
tetes with heads of state and 
strolled the Great Wall of China . 
He has visited troops in Bosnia, 
and viewed Michelangelo's mas-
terpieces in the Sistine Chapel. 

When Air Force One touched 
down late Sunday night in 
Ankara, Clinton began a trip 
throu gh southern Europe that 

. will eclipse Bush's last remaining 
travel distinction, the record for 
number of nations visited by an 
American president. 

By the trip's end just before 
Thanksgiving, Clinton will have 
stopped in 63 nations over the 

NAVY: 
Officials have not 
publicly responded 
ContInued from PIIP 1 
and traditional fratemities. 

The recommendation provoked 
a flurry of protests from those who 
believe that putting women with 
men in the extraordinarily tight 
confines of a submarine would dis-
rupt the crew and compromise its 
war-fighting ability . . 

It has exposed a significant rift 
between the Navy's civilian lead-
ership, led by Richard Danzig, 
the. secretary of the 'Navy, and 
some of its senior officers. 

Danzig signaled support for 
integrating the submarine fleet in 
a speech to the Naval Submarine 
League last summer, but in the 
ensuing controversy over his 
remarks, he retreated. In the 
speech, he warned that the "sub-
marine community" - a tightly 
knit cadre of crewmen and offi-

course of his presidency, many of 
which have never before been 
host to an Ar:nerican president. 

The cost of the trips has riled 
some of Clinton's detractors on 
Capitol Hill. In the course of just 
over three months in 1998, the 
president's trips to Chile, China 
and six African countries cost an 
estimated $72 million, according 
to a recent study by the General 
Accounting Office, the investiga-
tive arm of Congress. 

The total number of officials 
and others who traveled at gov-
ernment expense in connection 
with the three trips exceeded 
2,400 ppnple, excluding Secret 
Service agents, the accounting 
office report said. Although the 
report did not directly compare 
Clinton's entourage with those 
of past presidents, administra-
tion officials say that presiden-
tial travel has grown more elab-
orate and complicated over the 
years.

cers - risked becoming danger-
ously out of touch with SOCiety if 
it did not adapt to include 
women, as well as an increased 
number of minority submariners. 

But in Norfolk, home port for 
the Navy's Atlantic Fleet and 12 
of its 57 nuclear-powered attack 
submarines, the "white male pre-
serve" has been largely unmoved 
by Danzig's concerns and the 
committee's recommendations. 
To them, the singular experience 
of spending wee.ks submerged in 
tense, claustrophobic conditions 
- with little space and no priva-
cy - makes the introduction of 
women virtually unthinkable. 

Navy officials have not publicly 
responded to the committee's rec-
ommendation, saying they must 
first provide additional informa-
tion that the committee requested. 

The advisory committee, how-
ever, said the issue cannot wait -
because of questions of sexual 
equdlity and for practical reasons.

MADISON, Wis. - A bit fret-
ful about joining the work force, 
Virginia Andrajewski, 56, tumed 
to a fellow employee on her new 
job at the Crowne Plaza Hotel 
and whispered, "Am I doing all 
right?" 

Told she was doing splendid-
ly, Ms. Andrajewski, who has 
mental retardation, broke into a 
broad smile as she stood behind 
a laundry table, neatly folding 
pillowcases in a tall pile. 

As a flourishing economy 
exhausts the nation's labor sup-
ply, more employers are court-
ing disabled workers like Ms. 
Andrajewski, whose talents 
were long overlooked . 

"I'd fike to say we hired 
Virginia because we' re just a 
good corporate citizen," said 
Bob King, the general manager 
at the hotel in the Wisconsin cap-
ital, where the unemployment 
rate is less than 2 percent. "But 
the truth is, we hired her because 
she's a good, loyal and depend-
able worker, and our business 
needs her." 

On the job less than a month, 

As a flourishing economy 
exhausts the nation's 
'Iabor supply, more 
employers are courting 
disabled workers like Ms. 
Andrajewski, whose 
talents were long 
overlooked. 

Ms. Andrajewski recently 
earned a wage increase to $6.65 
an hour, which surprised and 
delighted her when she opened 
her check. 

"This is all new to me, but I 
sure do like it," said Ms. 
Andrajewski, whose warm 
manner and dry wit have made 
her popular with colleagues in 
the hotel laundry room. "For a 
long time, I was just floating 
along." 

The changing employment 
fortunes of people with mental 
disabilities are part of a trend, 
experts say, reflecting a broader 
change in society's views of the 

mentally retarded, especially 
among younger people who 
have been taught that diversity 
means more than different races 
or religiOns. 

Between 1988 and 1996, 
employment increased more than 
300 percent among people served 
by state mental-retardation agen-
cies, said Charles Lakin, the direc-
tor of the Research and Training 
Center on Community Living in 
MiMeapolis. . 

Some 337,000 adults with 
mental retardation now hold 
jobs. Of those working, nearly 
half have jobs in competitive 
employment, while the others 
worl< in jobs subsidized for peo-
ple with disabilities. 

The level of employment is 
highest among young adults 
with mental retardation who 
have left school in the last five 
years, with about 23 percent 
holding "competitive," or 
unsubsidized, jobs, according to 
Arc, an advocacy group for pe0-
ple with mental retardation.

Old Timers Meet Bradley for Fund Raising 
NEW YORK - Twenty-six 

years after he helped the New 
York Knicks win their last NBA 
title, former Sen. Bill Bradley 
returned to Madison Square 
Garden on Sunday to stage one 
of the largest, slickest and most 
unusual political fund-raisers in 
memory, taking in' $1.5 million 
for his insurgent presidential 
campaign. 

Featuring a cast of movie 
stars, musicians and 20 Hall of 
Fame basketball players, the 
event drew more than 7,000 pe0-
ple, many of whom said they 
had shelfed out $100 to $1,000 
per ticket for the chance to relive 
a glittering moment in Knick 
history as much as to assist 
Bradley's underdog struggle for 
the Democratic preSIdential 
nomination. 

With flashing lights and 
.pounding music, the Bradley 
campaign even recreated a scene 
still etched in the memories of 

many middle-aged Knicks fans: 
the dramatic entrance of Willis 
Reed, the team's injured captain, 
onto the Garden · floor for the 
seventh and deciding game of 
the 1970 league finals against the 
Los Angeles Lakers. The Knicks 
won that game, despite Reed's 
limp, to gain their first NBA title. 

As the crowd cheered on 
Sunday, Reed, wearing orange-
and-white Knicks warm-ups 
over his business suit, ~nacted 
his gimpy walk from the locker 
room onto the hardwood floor, 
where he lined up near the bas-
ket with his former Knick team-
mates, took a pass from Bradley 
and laid the ball into the hoop. 

"The game was beautiful to 
watch during that time," Julius 
Erving, a Hall of Fame player 
with the Philadelphia 76ers, told 
the crowd in one of several testi-
monials to Bradley. "Some of 
what Bill's campaign is about is 
bringing back the good old days, 

bringing back unity, solidarity, 
bringing back team play, team-
work." 

Joining Erving for the event 
were some of the league's great-
est players, ·including Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Cousy, Moses 
Malone, Oscar Robertson, Bob 
Pettit, Nate Archibald and Dave 
Bing. And all the starters from 
the Knicks 1970 and 1973 teams 
were there: Walt Frazier, Dave 
DeBusschere, Earl Monroe, Dick 
Barnett, Jerry Lucas and Reed. 

The day offered a contrast in 
the campaign strategies of 
Bradley and his lone rival for the 
Democratic nomination, Vice 
President AI Gore. While 
Bradley continues to run heavily 
on his biography, Gore has 
focnsed on attacking Bradley' s 
record, party loyalty and plan to 
make health care available to 
almost all Americans.

Craig Siders, lead author of 

the study, said that scientists

"This is the first time that we

therefore creating a very hot and

Michael McMillan, a player 
from the UCSD men's basketball 
team, said he enjoyed the game. 

"It's fun to get out here even 
though we are going to get 
killed," he said. 

Teammate Nick Christensen 
agreed, adding that the game 
aOowed him to appreciate the 
difficulties of using a wheelchair. 

"The event is a good cause 
because it shows how hard the 
game is," he said. "It's the first

SOUTH BEND, Ind . - A 
tense, 130-minute meeting of the 
student senate yielded a resolu-
tion and an open letter respond-

ing the University of Notre 
Dame's relationship with Tire 
Observer. 

Michelle Krupa, editor in chief 
of Tire Observer, addressed the 
senate in order to provide back-

NEWS 9 

ground on the issue. . . 
According to Krupa, the uni-

versity functions as Tile Observer's 
accountant, rather than publish-
er. Recently, this arrangement has 
caused problems as the universi-
ty has tried to. use its oversight to 
dictate Ti,e Observer's advertising 
policy. In particular, the universi-
ty has set forth a policy d ictating 
to Tire Observer that it may no t 
accept advertisements from 
GALA ND/ SMC (Gay and 
Lesbian Alumni of Notre 
Dame/ Saint Mary's College). 

Krupa maintains that as an 
independent publication, Tire 
Observer has created and abides 
by its own policies, not those pre-
sented by the university. 

"The bottom line of this issue 
is the independence of Tire 
Obstrvtr and the academic free-
dom that underlies it," said Matt 
Mamak, chief of staff for the 
office of the student body presi-
dent. 

Krupa welcomes a meeting 
with University President 
Father Edward Malloy, but said 
that his office had refused to 
schedule a time for him to meet 
with representatives from the 
newspaper. 

"We have twice requested a 
meeting with Father Malloy," she 
said. "We were told it would be 
impossible to meet with Father 
Malloy due to his busy sched-
ule." 

Representatives from Tire 
Obst:rver have met with Malloy's 
liaison to the newspaper, 
Chandra Johnson. 

"She UohnsonJ said, on one 
occasion, that nothing in writing 
exists to describe such a relation-
ship and that Notre Dame is not 
willing to crea te such a sta te-
ment," Krupa said. 

The senate drafted a resolu-
tion to create an administrative 
committee that would arrive at a 
concrete university policy 
regarding the administration's 
relationship to The Observer. 

The resolution eventually 
passed with 27 members of the 
senate voting in favor and one 
voting against.

Community Service May 
Be Required to Graduate 
DECISION: Governor hopes to pass law this month 
By ANNE BENJAMINSON 
Dally Californtan 

(U-WIR E) BERKELEY, alif. 
tate and University of 

California-Berkeley officials met 
on campus Thursday to consider 
a mandatory community service 
requirement for UC students that 
cou ld be implemented as soon as 
the year 2000. 

Davis sent a letter to UC 
President Richard Atkinson in 
July 1998 asking him to develop a 
proposal for the UC system that 
would make community service 
a graduation requirement. A sim-
ilar letter was sent to the presi-
dents of the California State 
University and California com-
munity college systems. 

A representa tive from the gov-
ernor 's office said that while 
Dav is strongly desires a commu-
nity service requirement, he is 
flexible abou t the way it could be 
implemented. 

"The governor is not commit-
ted to one particular approach," 
said Diana Fuentes-Michele, the 
assistant secretary for higher 
education in the governor 's office 
of education. " We should not 
mandate and dictate the details 
[of community service require-
ments) . The options might not be 
uniform throughout the system." 

Fuentes-Michele said she was 
aware of students' financial hard-
ships, which could limit the 
amount of time they have ava il-
able to perform community ser-
vice. Despite concerns about the 
implementation of the requ ire-

ment, including how it would be 
funded and administered, the 
governor is determined to make 
UC students participate in com-
munity service before they grad-
uate. 

"There is a great deal of con-
cern about money, capacity and 
liability," she said. "[But) the gov-
ernor feels strongly we really 
have to be doing something more 
for others." 

Andy Furco, the director of 
UC Berkeley's Service Learning 
Research and Development 
Center, expressed concern over 
some issues surrounding . the 
requirement. 

Furco noted the rising popu-
larity of service learning, which 
occurs when community service 
parallels a student's academic 
curriculum. 

He also questioned the 
motives behind requiring service 
of students. . 

Davis, however, has said he 
hopes to pass legislation this year 
that would imflement the 
requirement for fal 2000, accord-
ing to the California Commission 
on Improving Life Through 
Service. 

After the meet ing, Student 
Regent Michelle Pannor said she 
would support a proposal that 
instituted a systemwide commu-
nity service requirement only if 
low-income students were some-
how financially compensated.

Joelle Wolstein, a senior at

Newport Beach. 

An information fair held at

academic departments.

Veterans, but all of the veterans 
of America's Allies. He said that 
Mexico's 2001 airborne 
squadron was in attendance as 
well as survivors of the Polish 
army, which fought against 
Germany in 1939. He also said 
that 51 Russian World War II 
combatants marched in the 
parade. 

The parade also included 
local pofiticians. Several super-
visors · and mayoral candidates 
were in attendance: State 
Senator Bill Morrow and 
Congressman Bob Filner both 
participated in the parade. 
Congressman Brian Bilbray, 
known in the community as a 
supporter of veterans, could not 
attend at last minute because he 
was in Tijuana helping to free 
imprisoned Marine Sergeant 
Brian Johnston. 

Presidential candidate Steve 
Forbes was expected to ride a 

who was working at a booth for 
the Muslim Student Association, 
said that it was important for 
student organizations to be pre-
sent at the event. 

"When students come to the 
university, they are so concerned 
with academics; they don't 
know that these organizations 
exist until their junior or senior 
year," she said. "However, 
Preview Day provides an oppor-
tunity to let them know ahead of 
time." 

Saint John said she was 
pleased with the event. 

car in the parade, but his office 
said he could not attend due to 
scheduling conflicts. San Diego 
Mayor Susan Golding did not 
attend but sent an aide in her 
place. 

Brunner said that community 
support for veterans in San 
Diego is very low. He said that 
the veterans organized the 
parade to honor themselves 
when it should be the other way 
around - the citizens of the city 
should organize a parade to 
honor the veterans. 

Fed up with being forgotten, 
Brunner said veterans in the 
San Diego area formed the 
United Veterans Council. 
Composed of 54 veteran 
groups that include the 
American Legion and the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the 
group plans, pays for and orga-
nizes a parade every Nov. 11 for 
the community. 

Brunner quoted George 
Washington to explain the 
importance of honoring the vet-
erans:· "The willingness with 
which our young people are 
likely to serv~ in any war, no 
matter how justified, shall be

"It's a wonderful day. People 
are having a wonderful time. I 
am delighted to have them 
here," she said. 

Saint John added that -plans 
are already being made for 
April's Admit Day, a similar 
event for students already 
admitted to the university. 

"We normally have an.atten-
dance of 8,000 to 10,000 - more 
than double the size of Pre~iew 
Day," Saint John said. 

All five undergraduate col-
leges will participate in Admit 
Day. 

they perceive the veterans of 
earlier wars were appreciated by 
their nation." 

Veterans Day, proclaimed a 
holiday in 1938, honors all men 
and women who have served in 
the armed forces. The dar. 
marks the end of World War , 
when at the 11th hour of the 
11 th day in ihe 11th month of 
1918, an armistice was signed 
and the "war to end all wars" 
was over. 

Although Veterans Day is a 
national holiday, UC students 
do not have the day off because 
the UC Regents do not observe it 
as a holiday. 

A bill was introduced by 
State Senator Bill Morrow in 
the California State Senate 
requesting the UC Regents to 
deSignate Nov. 11 as a Veterans 
Day holiday for both sta ff and 
students. The necessary hear-
ing to pass this bill into law 
was canceled at the request of 
Morrow. 

Morrow could not be 
reached to comment on 
whether he intends to reintro-
duce the bill to the state senate 
and for what reasons he can-
celed the bill.

HORIZONS: 
You and Your Dollar 

Considering the cost of travel, from 
Amsterdam to Zimbabwe 

Story by Jenna Barclay 
Senior Staff Writer 

Deciding on how and where you want to travel is a voyage in itself. For college students, traveling is a 
rite of passage into adulthood. 

Exploration of far-off countries immerses 
young people into cultures and languages 
outside their own. 

But before the trip even begins, explo-
ration of where, when and how much 
travel can be a driving force behind the 
itinerary. Often it is the difference 
between diving in the reefs of Australia 
and camping in Rosari to. 

Guides brimming out of bookstore 
shelves, with their affable, user-friendly 
lists of " to-see"s, "to-stay"s and "to-eat"s, 
are specifically geared to help those work-
ing on a limited budget find the cheapest 
ways to travel for adventurous students. 

Airfares 
The greatest and often most discourag-

ing cost of travel is the plane ticket. That 
enormous lump sum wrenched out of 
your bank account long before your 
departure may be a deterrent. 

Airfares range from country to coun-
try. Destinations further away will cost 
more. However, the ground costs, such as 
taxis and hotels, are often cheaper in more 

di~tant places. You can either go online 
and explore the va rious sources of air 
travel or go to a travel agency and let the 
agents do the work for you . 

Thankfully, there are many options 
today via the Internet and through travel 
agencies providing cheaper air fares. Air-
line prices fluctuate from day to day and 
from hour to hour in response to a myriad 
of conditions; the number of sales, cancel-
lations, the weather, planes schedules, 
competition between airlines and local 
and world events. 

Agencies hone in on these fluctuations 
and spot tickets when their prices are low. 
Some agencies project certain J'eriods 
when air travel will be light an prices 
will be cheaper. Advertisements for these 
agencies can be easily found in newspa-
pers and magazines. Many magazines are 
dedicated solely to travel, and newspa-
pers such as the San Diego U"io" ,Triblllle 
carry a travel section at least once a week. 

Council Travel is available on campus 
in Price Center. Council Travel agents are 
used to working within student budgets 
and often advertise lowered fares. The 
agency also offers a card that discounts 
future f1ishts. Council Travel also offers 
membership cards to Hostelling Interna-
tionill, which is particularly advanta-
geous in Europe, where the card is neces-

. sary for people staying in hostels. 
APEX (Advanced Purchase Tickets) 

offers 25 to 40 percent lower fares. The 
only contingency is that the tickets are 
purchased far in advance. 

Standby Fares, though not as cheap as 
APEX, also offers discounted economic 
fares with tickets from from last-minute 
cancellations. 

Buckets Shops are only a recent phe-
nomenon in the United States. Here, air-
lines provide a portion of their tickets to 
these shops to sell at lower fares. Compe-
tition for these tickets is huge, so it is best 
to ca II fi rst. 

The important thing to remember is 
that the competition between airlines and

blind Nurture Your Dark Side Self-help for those suffering from Chronic Complacency Syndrome 
OBSERVATIONS 

BEN GLEIBERMAN 
Contributing Staff Writer 

not immediately advancing their 
success, have great long-term 
impact on how they will see the 
world, and their a~ility to enjoy 
their place in life. 

Our program generally results 
in this very valuable asset called 
life experience. This would be the 
product of our corporation, if you 
must think of it in a business 
sense. I know what you are all 
thinking out there. 

"This sounds fine and good, 
but how much willi have to pay 

sort of prison record, which we, 
and our parent company Crazy 
Ass Incorporated, assume no lia-
bility for. 

Of course I'm only kidding. 
You see, the secret is that the pro-
gram is absolutely free. No 
charge! This Institute already 
exists inside of you. To put it in 
terms a Revene student can 
understand, it's like software that 
has been preloaded into your 
lOmputer's hard drive. that com-
puter being that great big melon 

gious networks. Checks can be 
made out to "The Institute of 
.Dark Side Development," which 
is spelled B-e-n G-l-e-i-b-e-r-m-
a-no . 

Maybe you're not yet sold as 
to why it is important to do more 
at college than just study. Perhaps 
you don't see the purpose in get-
ting a little crazy or having a few 
wild experiences while you still 
can. Well, allow me to try to con-
vince you. 

First, we have the idea of "set-

Are you a little bored with 
your college experience? Do you 
fee l adventurous when you find 
yourself parking in a 20 minute 
zone for a 50 minute class? Is 
your idea of spontaneity an 
unplanned study session, or 
maybe a double shot of espresso 
when you know that you can 
only handle a single? If so, then 
the "Institute for Dark Side 
Development" is the place for 
you. 

Here at Dark Side we take 
those people who suffer from 
Chronic Complacency Syndrome. 
It is our job to bring out their 
latent wild tendencIes. These are 
people who feel content in doing 
what they usually do, and what 
that is is "unexciting stuff." They 
exhibit a marked lack of interest 
in the notion, "trying something 
new." We try to activa te this 
desi re to take "risks," take 
"chances." 

We have the idea of "settling down." Most of you will get married 
one day, buy a house, buy a dog, consider accompanying that 
dog with a few kids, and in other words, "settle down." Implicit in 
this term is the fact that you have refrained from doing something 
that you used to do in the past. Some noticeable change has to 
take place. I don't think that going from responsible-and-cautious, 
to responsible-and-cautious-plus-wife-house-and-kids ... and-dog 
qualifies as a "noticeable change." 

We have a course on "doing 
something just for the sake of 
havi ng done it." This is a concept 
fore ign to many of our new 
members who are used to doing 
things tha t "fit in the big piC-
ture," that "make logical sense." 
It is th is sort of " practical" 
thought pa ttern that we discour-
age. We teach our followers that 
these random excursions, while 

to join such an Institute? Probably 
$5 million, right?" 

Well you 're absolutely correct! 
For the low, low price of just 5 
million American dollars, (that's 
$7 million Canadian,) you may 
increase your enjoyment of life! 
How about that? And, if you 're 
really looking to stir things up, 
you can act now and we will 
throw in our reckless abandon 
package at no additional charge! 
Although completion of the reck-
less package may result in some 

on the top of your neck. 
All you have to do to access it 

is to click on the icon. Of course, 
the use of the word "icon" here is 
only a metaphor. There is no need 
for any Revelle students to panic 
because you do not see this icon 
on your desktop. 

Donations, however, to the 
Institute are gladly accepted . In 
fact, some research shows that 
the more you donate, the greater 
your chance of success. I borrow 
this logic from television reli-

tling down." Most of you will get 
married one day, buy a house, 
have a few kids and finally settle 
down. Implicit in the term "set-
tling down" is the "from what?". 
In other words, in order to really 
settle down, there has to be some 
noticeable change. I don't think 
that going from responsible-and-
cautious, to responsible-and-cau-
tious-plus-wife-house-and-kids .. . 
and-dog qualifies as a "noticeable 
change."

lege affords to you to do the 
things that you will find the luxu-
ry to do later in life. As long as 
you' re passing your classes, the 
only.person you're responsible to 
is yourself. And it's your respon-
sibility to have fun and to do 
things that you will one day try to 
prevent your own kids from 
doing. 

Our motto is, "You only live 
once." If you haven't experienced 
everything, you may not even 
know the possibilities that you 
are missing. It is stupid to just 
assume that you've made the 
right decision, when you have no 
experience to base that decision 
on. College provides you the 
chance to do have these experi-
ences. Experience outside of 
studying is an extension of your 
education. 

Still not convinced? Well, for 
those of you who are business 
minded I will explain one more 
time. One day in the future you 
may be in a desperate financial 
situation and the only thing you 
can do to make money is to write 
a book. If you didn't take my 
advice, the book will be boring 
and it won' t sell. Thus, a crazy, 
hedonistic youth clearly makes 
economic sense. 

Not enough? How about the 
fact that the economy depends on 
young people's adventures? 
There are many industries that 
would be suffering if it weren't 
for college students who had 
done random things. A few exam-

TRAVEL: 
Traveling light 
makes trip easier 

travel agencies is fierce, which 
lends much to student advantage. 
Generally, if you hold to your 
budget, you will find an afford-
able price. 

Baggage 
For anyone who has kept half 

of an eye open this past decade, 
this one is a no-brainer: back-
packing. 

Stores will sell traveling back-
packs from $79 to $1,000. Travel-
ing the streets of Europe, Tokyo or 
Sidney, whether they are cobbled 
or paved, does not require more 
than a humble $100-$200 pack. 

For a good travel backpack, try 
Big Five Sporting Goods on Mira 
Mesa Boulevard or Sports Chalet 
at UTe. 

The most important thing is to 
travel light. And once you've 
determined the maximum that 
you can possibly carry, extract 
yourself from your shell and 
unpack about one-third of it. 
Really, you won't need it. 

Accommodations 
From hostels, cheap bed-and-

breakfasts and self-catering flats 

BLIND: 
Education goes 
beyond book smarts 
ContIMIed froIII ..... 14 
pies are the liquor manufacturers, 
bail bondsmen and local news 
reporters. There are many others, 
but these are the main three. Just 
look at the local news as a conve-
nient way to let friends and fami-
ly know what it is that you're up 
to. And hell, it's cheaper than 
using MCI. 

Our youthful experiments 
keep the economy strong. I don't 
know about you, but I sure don't 
want to ~ause the next recession 
because I was too selfish to go 
out and have a good time. It is 
our civic duty as citizens of the 
United States of America to 
spend lots of money on hedonist 
activities. 

I hope that I have convinced 
you of the importance of making 
the most of your college years. We 
have an unfettered ability to exer-
cise our free will and truly experi-
ence all that we desire. Take 
advantage of this opportunity. 

If, for no other reason, when 
you are 80 and talking to your 
grandkids, you'll have more 
interesting stories to tell them 
than, "yeah kids, I studied once, 
al! night long. I studied so much 
that people thought I was from 

Revelle.~ 
Go to parties, go skydiving, 

take a random trip to Mexico, get 
drunk, have a sexual encounter in 
the library, steal something small, 
go in the ocean at midnight, go to 
Vegas, toilet paper. a friend 's 
house, make up a fake I.D. and go 
out to a bar, or just stay out all 
night. If you can't stay up, just 
have a double shot of espresso. 
No one will ever know. 

If this seems like it's not part 
of your personality, then join the 
Institute of Dark Side Develop-
ment and let us do our magiC. If 
you don' t get help at the Insti-
tute, please. get help some-
where. Before it's too late and 
you end up settling down, so to 
speak.

in Europe and parts of Asia and 
Australia, to missions. rest houses 
and bottomed-out hotels in 
Africa, South America and Russia, 
you should have few problems 
finding a chear place to sleep. 

The hoste is definitely the 
most prevalent mode of cheap 
accommodation around the 
world. There are 4,500 hostels 
worldwide, varying from reno-
vated castles to tepees to railroad 
cabooses. They cost from $10 to 
$20 a night, not including dis-
counts for memberships. 

Some homes offer cheap 
rooms to sleep in at low costs. 
South America has been particu-
larly noted for its hospitality; 
where some families simply offer 
to feed and house foreigners for 
the evening. 

There are also self-cateri!lg 
flats and guest houses, which 
range in price from $15 to $30 and 
can be found in most travel 
guides. 

Looking up distant relatives is 
also a great way to re-establish 
old family ties and have a more 
inside taste of foreign culture. 

Camping and hiking are by far 
the cheapest and most inVigorat-
ing ways to go. Travelers who feel 
propelled beyond the borders of 
the urban jungles or the coziness 
of the provincial hollow may fru-
gally accommodate themselves 
within the breadth of nature. • 

The UCSD Guardian 

There are national parks all 
over the world and increasingly 
efficient infrastructure to carry 
tourists safely to more remote 
regions. 

Ground Transportation 
The most common modes of 

transportation in almost every 
country are bus and train. Eurail, 
covers 17 countries within its net-
work and is huge in Western 
Europe, while some Southern and 
Eastern European rail lines 
require you to purchase your tick-
ets as you go. 

Packaged train travel is gener-
ally unique to Europe. However, 
one will find that train prices else-
where are relatively inexpensive 
and that buses are also an alterna-
tive option. 

There is also the matter of time 
efficiency. While trains are cer-
tainly faster than buses in more 
developeCl countries, like those of 
Western Europe, buses may be a 
much better alternative in less-
developed countries in Latin 
America and Africa, where infra-
structure is ineffkient and erratic. 

Hiking is the most invigorat-
ing and frugal way to get around. 
Your expenses consist of little 
more than the cost of your shoes. 

Food 
Perhaps one of the greatest 

symbols of American culture is 

THE 
PRINCETON 
REVIEW 

the sight of those beloved golden 
arches, which seem to have slow-
ly, insidiously sprinkled them-
selves all over the globe. Do not 
give in to that familiar glow! 
McDonalds and other such fast 
food chains are often twice as 
expensive, if not more, in foreign 
countries. 

Cheap open-food markets are 
a totally common phenomenon 
everywhere else in the world . 
Food is sold at stands, including 
meat, poultry, bread, fruits and 
vegetables. The difference in price 
between these open-air markets 
and Lucky's is unbelievable. 

It is a good idea to carry along 
with you a staple, like bread, 
fruit, rice or trail mix to munch on 
throughout the day. By doing so, 
you will not risk the possibility of 
driving yourself into such a state 
of hunger that the allure of an 
overpriced food item will become 
just too much to bear. 

Less-developed rural regions 
are known to be hospitable to for-
eigners. Partaking in authentic 
meals is a wonderful way to learn 
about a foreign culture. 

Bartering 
Living in the richest country in 

the world has its liabilities. The 
most common stereotype of the 
American tourist is that we have 
money to spend. In order to avoid 
this trap of over spending. it is 

FEATURES IS 

best to gather a few bargaining 
skills before going abroad. While 
it is obvious that one can not talk 
down the price of a coat in a 
French boutique, tourists have 
the power to negohate in smaller, 
open markets than you may 
believe: 

1) If an item is unmarked, 
determine how much you 'd actu-
ally be willing to pay -
unmarked items signal the clerk's 
fl exibility to negotiate. 

2) Refuse to pay more than the 
price you have chosen. 

3) Play dumb and use the lan-
guage barrier to your advantage. 

4) Do not be fooled by the 
clerk's look of discouragement 

. when you refuse to lower your 
price - owners generally make a 
killing off tourists. 

5) If the clerk does not submit, 
begin to retreat with a discour-
aged look of your own - almost 
always the clerks will hail you 
back. 

6) Always carry a stack of one-
dollar bills with you - because 
they are often the most coveted 
currency, they mar actually serve 
as the price's fina nudge in your 
direction.

Well, it was coming 
over here, because I'm 
from England, but now 
I would have to say 
Thailand. It seems like 
it is getting destroyed 
really quiCK and 
getting too touristy. It 
also seems really 
beautiful.

Ethiopia, because my 
family is there. [Or] 
the Dominican 
Republic because there 
are fine guys there and 
you can dance to good 
music. It would be 
good to be immersed 
in another culture.

Italy, because I've 
been to parts of Europe 
and I thmk that Italy 
has such a distinct 
culture that I would 
want to experience. It 
would be a chance of a

TRAVEL: 
Don't get suckered 
by tourist traps 
Continued from ..... 11 
al things can slip out of our minds 
once we've taken them from our 
sight, either by paying for them 
and putting them into our bags, 
or by yanking ourselves away 
from a tantalizing store window 
display. It is important to assess 
your true need or want for an 
item before you purchase it. A 
persuasive salesman and a seduc-
tive display may convince you 
that you need an item. 

Also, remember that souvenirs 
are not the ultimate memory 
keepsakes. Foregoing the pur-
chase of that Buddha key chain 
for yourself or for aunt Hilda will 
not lessen the genuineness of 
your trip, nor will it lessen the 
recounting of your tales abroad. 

Photos 
Photographs are wonderful 

memory keepsakes for capturing 
amazing moments. However, 
there is a big difference between 
preservation and carting home 12 
rolls of film to fill your 500-page 
photo album. 

Having so many pictures may 
actually detract from the singular-
ity of those valuable moments -
not to mention the fact that they 
are guaranteed to bore even your 
most devoted traveling friends. 

A side reminder: Always pur-
chase film and batteries before 
you leave. They cost two to four 
times as much abroad. 

Tourist Sites and Entertainment 
Before dashing off to the near-

est tourist attraction, it is impor-
tant to acknowledge your imme-
diate environment. The fact that 
you have come to a foreign place 
means that everything atound you 
holds the potential for adventure. 

Traveling is not something 
that has been encapsulated in 
some event or landmark that the 
country's tourism industry has 
deemed essential. There are many 
things to be seen that do not 

Monday, November 15, 1999 

require you to fo rk over all of 
your money to stand on some 
crowded terrace surrounded bv 
other American tourists. . 

In searching for things to do, 
remember your reasons for wanti-
ng to travel, which are hopefully 
not to spend the afternoon watch-
ing an American movie in Ger-
many or ea ting a McBLT in Tai-
wan. If your budget IS small , 
embrace the opportunity to savior 
some local sites that you will prob-
ably not see again for a long time. 

Itinerary _ 
While traveling should be 

fueled by whimsy, a rough out-
line of destinations and schedules 
is crucial for reducing the chance 
of getting into expensive messes. 
At the same time, flexibility is as 
equally vital when you do get in 
to these messes. Rigidly hooking 
your expectations on to a certain 
site or city will invariably cost 
you a great deal of time and 
aggravation. 

Rough Estimates 
Indeed there will be costs, 

such as airfare, food and enter-
tainment, that will be unavoid-
able. Still, they should in no way 
deter the tentative and the unin-
formed from finding and invent-
ing newer and more unique ways 
to budget.

POINTS: 
Offensi ve execution 
deserves a hand 
CoRtIII .... from ..... 23 
go deep, but the guy's cohort 
gobbled up an interception and 
displayed his usual excellence in 
leaping ability by knocking some 
passes to the turf. 

The defensive line assisted in 
the secondary's success by uti-
lizing the "swim" move and 
angry mentalities to penetrate 
into the Eagles' backfierd. Big AI, 
who reminds one of CBS football 
analyst Brent Jones, spearhead-
ed the Freeballer attack in this 
department, but he will be 
remembered for his offensive 
line abilities - he crushed an 
opposing lineman, opening a 
large hole through which the 
guy ran to daylight. 

A10ng~ith the memorable 
offensive d defensive line play 
of the F bailers was the high 
rate of execution by the backs, 
receivers, and the quarterback. 
The latter is worthy of further dis-
cussion. The Freeballer QB is 
quickly becoming one of the top-
rated passers in the UCSD intra-
mural football league. His leader-
ship on the field is developing 
despite the less-than-terrific per-
formance in week one in which 
readers were informed of the 
"lame ducks" he threw. 

But when he decided to aban-
don the deep passing attack in 
favor of championship-style short 
passes, his teammates felt 
relieved. The quick slant pattern 
is still in the developing phase, 
but the guy's cohort, who contin-
ues to knock down passes in the 
Freeballer secondary, will soon 

have his timing down with the 
quarterback. As long as the quar-
terback does not decide to go 
home for the weekend as he has 
been known to do during softball 
season, he will lead his team to 
the championship. 

Friday's game was a battle for 
first place between the Eagles and 
the Freeballers and the quarter-
back's accuracy in the contest 
helped the Freeballers win and 
guaranteed his team a top seed in 
the playoff along with first place 
in the league. 

The receivers for the 
Freeballers also were quite suc-
cessful in opening up the run-
ning attack. The two Freeballer 
backs, the guy and Len, had 
many holes and seams through 
which to run up the middle of the 
field because of the po~itioning 
of their receivers. The cohort, 
along with catching some passes, 
took his man deep, which 
widened the field for the running 
backs. The guy pretty much only 
needed to get passed the line-
man, and from there it was sim-
ply a foot race. 

Al and Kevin would hold the 
opposing defensive lineman up at 
the line of scrimmage, and oh, 
what a hole. The guy and others 
hanging around for the twilight 
intramural frat games discussed 
to death the possibility of using 
this sort of running attack in com-
bination with the receivers run-
ning deep fly patterns in the next 
week's match -- the first playoff 
game. You can bet that the guy 
will be ready to unleash fury next 
Friday. 

If you thought that Week Four 
was interesting, then just wait 
until you hear about Week Five. 
The post-season will be an excit-
ing event to read about.

SPIKES: 
Tritons adjusted 
strategically to win 
ContInued from ..... 22 
West Regional Champions of the 
NCAA. 

"We came in here knowing 
that we were going to get a bat-
tle, and that 's what they gave 
.us, " said Marion Champion of 
the Pioneers. "I think that they 
took advantage of the brOKen 
plays and kept their composure 

• during those situations. They 
also did a great job on attacking 
balls on brOken plays." 

4 

"We were struggling a little in 
the beginning, but we stuck 
around and played hard, and it 
was good teamwork by the whole 
group," Punelli said. 

Next up for the Tritons is a 
match against last year's foes, 
who they battled with and lost to 
for the National Championship 
last season: No. 1 Central 
UniverSity. The Tritons will face 
their opponent in the quarterfi-
nals in Iowa in what will be no 
walk in the park for UCSD. If the 
Tritons advance, they will have 
the opportunity to play for the 
National Championship at 
Rimae arena on Dec. 4. Go 
Tritons!

DEFENSE: 
Tritons refuse to 
give away free kicks 
CoRlI ••• d,..... ..... 23 

"When the foul came, we 
went down the line to create 
chances," Abizaid said. "It was a 
beautifully kicked balL" 

The bench played a big part 
in the game, with Bork entering 
part-way in the second half to 
set up the assist. 

"Some kids needed 
breathers," McManus said. 
"Erika [Alfredson) came in and 
did a great job on the right side. 
If you look at our stats, almost 
everyone has scored. That's 
what good tearns do." 

Late in the match, at the 83:30· 
mark, McManus was tossed for 
complaining about the officiat-
ing. 

"There was jersey pulling," 
McManus explained. "They 
were doing it since the begin-
ning of the game. In the end, we 
started doing it since everybody 
was doing it." 

With McManus out, assistant 
Mike Nicholson took the coach-
ing reins. 

Bein~ that the restriction was 
only a 'game management ejec-
tion," McManus will be avail-
able to coach the next match. 

After taking the 1-0 advan-
tage, UCSD was sure to hold the 
lead. 

"In the end, we didn' t want 
to give away any free kicks," 
McManus said, explaining how 
his team was finally able to 
score. "At some point, some-
thing was going to break down. 
We flooded the box with play-
ers.1I 

The defense was impenetra-
ble, only allowing a few chances 

"Some kids needed 
breathers. Erika 
[Alfredson] came in and 
did a great job on the 
right side. If you look at 
our stats, almost 
everyone has scored. 
That's what good teams 
do." 

~Mc_ .. , 
Head Coach 

while holding the Tigers to a 
score of zero. 

"Our defense is awesome," 
said Borst, who plays a number 
of positions. "We played well." 

The beginning of the first half 
and the end of the first half was 
all UCSD. 

Ten minutes into the match, 

SPORTS 19 

the momentum evened out and 
it was a back-and-forth game. 
The game could have very well 
been put away by the Tritons 
numerous times. 

Like punished children, 
UCSD spent a lot of time in the 
corner. Corner kick after corner 
kick was taken by the Tritons, 
but each attempt came up 
empty. 

In the second half, the Tigers 
placed Giampaolo in as goal-
keeper to replace the injured 
starter. At the 63-minute mark, 
Bork headed into the game to 
give Jessica Cordova a rest. 

. To get to this win, the Tritons 
had to get through two epic 
marathons last week. 

"We had a lot of recovery 
time," Abizaid said . "We didn 't 
start practicing hard until 
Wednesday. We had some extra 
time off." 

"We' re getting everybody 
healthy and getting our heads 
back into it," McManus added. 
"It was a difficult week after the 
emotional weekend. We didn 't 
practice too much." This week-
end, the Tritons will travel to 
Wilmington, Massachusetts to 
face the undefeated No.1-
ranked College of New Jersey. 

"You go through one game at 
a time," Abizaid said . " It 's 
always a goal away. We want to 
be the best."

22 SPORTS 

SPIKES: 
Tri tons show their 
front court skills 
Continued from pq. 23 
Kueneman, the Tritons appeared 
as though they could do no 
wrong in winning this match. 
These three were hallmarks in 
U SO's offensive and defensive 
play at the net, and the trio gar-
nered a total of 22 kills on Friday 
mght. Furthermore, in the first 
game, UCSD appeared to be 
flowing almost perfectly as a 
team. When balls were hit on the 
Triton side, reactions in terms of 
positioning and setting up fo r 
kills were simul taneous, with 
players practically mirroring 
each other. 

In the second game, however, 
the Lutes counteracted some of 
UCSD's attacks at the net. Most 
notable was the rally that 
ensued when the game was tied 
4-4. Both teams kept the ball 
alive for about one minute, with 
the dramatic moments ending in 
Pacific Lutheran's favor. This 
was the only point in the game 
where it appeared that the 
Tritons may not have had a firm 
grip on what they wanted to do 
with the ball or how to counter-
act Pacific Lutheran's burgeon-
ing attack. 

But in the end, Head Coach 
Duncan McFarland and his team 
had the Lutes celebrating over 
garbage points instead of game-
winning kills. Setter Kueneman 
provided the actual game-
clincher and the Tritons were on 
their way to face Cal-State 
Hayward Pioneers, who along 
with the Tritons, had a first-
round bye. 

Not only did superior volley-
ball skills and the home-court 
advantage enable the Tritons to 
prevail, but team support played 

a key role as well. When the 
Lutes made mistakes, team-
mates tended to ignore the per-
son who committed the error, as 
opposed to the Tritons, who 
showed team camaraderie 
through vocal support or a pat 
on the back after a blown oppor-
tunity. 

On Saturday night the Tritons 
faced the Pioneers of Cal State 
Hayward. UCSD had beaten the 
Pioneers earlier this year three 
ga mes to one and the Tritons 
handed them another disap-
pointing outcome on Saturday 
night. 

Ea rly on though, the 

"We were struggling a 
little in the beginning, but 
we stuck around and 
played hard, and it was 
good teamwork by the 
whole group." 

-UIIIt ....... 
junior, UCSD Tritons 

Pioneers, unlike the Lutes in the 
previous match, were able to cre-
ate rallies and kill opportunities 
off the Tritons' front-col,lrt 
attack. In addition, UCSO 
looked a little flat early on as 
there was an early miscommuni-
cation at the net when Wilson 
received a set and failed to jump 
up and spike the pass as the ball 
fell untouched to the floor. The 
Pioneers ran the score to 4-0 
early in the game until Jamie 
Woods smashed the ball for one 
of her 10 kills of the match. That 
shot awakened the Tritons and 
more action-packed play tran-
spired whel1 Kathleen Hentz 
later checked into the game and 
nailed UCSD's fifth and sixth 
pomt. 

The UCSO Guardian 

The blocking and spiking of 
the Pioneers' right-side attack at 
the net kept the first game com-
petitive and the Tritons fouf'd 
themselves tied with Hayward 
14-14, making thos~ who 
ordered Pay-Per-View wonder if 
they'd make it home in time to 
catch the Lewis-Holyfield fight. 

Meanwhile, Hayward also 
managed to slap-shot the ball 
into areas of the court that the 
Tritons weren't covering. With 
the game tied, a series of side-
outs ensued for both teams until 
Leslie Punelli hit it perfectly into 
the backcourt, just making it 
inside the line for a 16-14 win. 

The second game saw more 
tough competition as the 
Pioneers compiled a 7-6 advan-
tage over UCSD. The Pioneers 
looked as though they were 
primed for another stab at the 
Tritons, but disaster struck when 
the 4'11" senior for the Pioneers, 
Ruby Guevarra, went down 
with a knee injury and was 
unable to leave the court unas-
sisted. The injury to Guevarra 
might have deflated some of her 
teammates' enthusiasm, for the 
Pioneers only scored eight more 
points in the match. The 
Pioneers failed to continue to 
find the empty spots on the 
Triton side of the court, and 
Kearney Visser hit the finishing 
kill for ~ 15-10 victory in game 
two. 

By the third game, UCSD had 
the Pioneers guessing as the 
Tritons scoop-shot the ball into 
the opponent's backcourt. 
Whenever Hayward tried to 
block UCSD at the net, the 
Tritons would exploit the 
Pioneers' backcourt. 

Once again, Visser experi-
enced the thrill of the game-win-
ning shot that made the UCSD 
women's volleyball team the

Guy Chronicles, 
Book III - Yardag~ 

The guy was primed for 
some more Friday-afternoon, 
energy-releasing intramural 
football as the FreebaUers took 
on the Eagles in what the guy 
considered his team's best dis-
play of offense all year. 
Everything from the move-
ment of the linemen to the 
post-touchdown celebrations 
seemed to be firing on all pis-
tons as the Freeballers cruised 
to a 14-0 victory. 

It wasn't all a breeze for the 
guy and his linebackers, how-
ever, as heavy Eagles coverage 
forced the Freeballers to camp 
out underneath early in the 
first half. 

There was this speedster, 
for instance, who liked to lead 
with his head when running 
patterns. He would stretch the 
patterns for a lot longer than 
one would need to - as if he 
thought that every ball thrown 
to him would go for a 60- or 
7D-yard gain. Usually, only the 
Freeballers' running back Len 
triumphs in accomplishing 
such athletic feats at this level 
of competition. . 

In any case, the receiver, 
whose hair resembled a rock 
guitarist 's, didn't have a sin-
gle reception under the guy's 
jurisdiction. Maybe it was the 
board shorts that slowed him 
down - the guy didn't care. 
He only wanted to ensure 

. that the player on the other 
end finished the game with 
zip in the catch column and 
his shirt filthy with grass 
stains. 

Bruises and blood - those 
are positive signs. But then 
there's the "Phantom 
Napper," who plays corner-
back when he's not back at the 
guy's apartment sound asleep 
during the game. This behav-
ior was disturbing to Big AI 
and Kevin, who contribute so 
much braun and gutsy play at 
the offensive . line. Kevin 
learned some' upsetting infor-
mation about a significant 
other prior to Friday after-
noon's contest, so another 
would have resulted in uncon-
trollable cacophony from the 
mouth of this skilled lineman. 
Luckily the Napper, who 
learned how to play football in 
Malaysia, managed to wake 
up when his alarm sounded at 
3:30;>.m. 

He had a pretty solid game 
covering the Eagfes out of the 
backfield and manning the 
down cones. Bravo! 
Moreover, he sustained some 
flesh. wounds on his knee that 
the guy empathized with 
pridefuHy. 

But back to the game. The 
quarterback had a great 
throwing day once again, but 
it was Len who stuck in a tight 
spiral to the guy, who then ran 
for about 20 yards. 

Borst Helps Tritons Edge Trinity 
HEROICS: Emma Borst scores game-winning goal as her team advances to the final four next week 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team is now in the exclusive terri-
tory of the final four of the NCAA 
tournament. 

In the quarterfinals of the 
NCAA National Tournament on 
Sunday, the Tritons downed 
Trinity University of San Antonio 
1-0 to advance to the semifinals. 

"We have leadership," UCSD 
Head Coach Brian McManus 
said. "We want to win. The pre-
season is over. Now we're in a 
five-game season and are three 
for three." 

It took nearly 72 minutes of 
play, but UCSD finally pulled it 
out halfway through the second 
half. 

On a free kick, Triton ChriSty 
Abizaid kicked the ball to team-
mate Heidi Bork. Bork touch-
passed the ball to Emma Borst, 
who booted the ball to Tiger goal-
keeper Jill Di Giampaolo. 

Giampaolo, who entered the 
game to start the second half in 
place of the injured Courtney 
Petrie, tried to pounce on the ball, 
but she bobbled it. Borst immedi-
ately. took advantage of 
Giampaolo's error and knocked 
the ball into the net for the deci-
sive goal. 

"The ball came in and it hit 
Heidi and kept coming." Borst 
said. "I saw the goalie was bob-
bling it, so I went after it. Before 
that, everything was just boom, 
boom, boom. I just did what I had 
to do."
