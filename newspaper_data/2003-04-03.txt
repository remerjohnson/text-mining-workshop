A.S. approves 
instant runoff Switching signs on Sunday 

New voting system to be 
implemented in 2004 

By CLAYTON WOIFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council overwhelm-
ingly approved the implementa-
tion of instant runoff voting in 
A. . elections at its March 12 
meeting. The open role call vote, 
which was tallied at 17-3-2 on 
March 14, came after a special 
presentation by the Voting 
Systems Task Force, which unan-
imou Iy recommended adopting 
lRY. The task force, which was 
chartered by the A.S. Council in 

January, chose IRV over nine 
other potential voting systems, 
including approval, Condorcet 
and the current system of plurali-
ty voting. 

The council's decision will 
take effect fifth week of spring 
quarter and will first be applicable 
to the 2004 A.S. elections. 

Under lRV; voters have the 
option of ranlcing candidates by 
preference, and if a candidate 
receives over 50 percent of fITst-

Grievances accuse of 
threats, falsified info 

By CiAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

Within the first two days of 
the opening of the 2003 A. . elec-
tions campaigning season, two 
grievances have been filed with 
the elections committee; one 
against the majority of the mem-
bers of the tudents First! slate 
for allegedly making a threaten-
ing phone call to the ommittee 
to Elect Kevin H u's chairman 
Phil Palisoul, the other against 
independent presidential candi-
date Kevin Hsu for allegedly "fal-
sifying information on election 
candidacy forms or campaign 
materials." 

The fir t was filed by Palisoul 
on March 31 against every run-
ning member of the Students 
First! late, with the exception of 
vice pre idem of finance candi-
date Harish Nandagopal. 

The second grievance was 
filed on April 1 by Nandagopal. 

According to Pali oul, he 
received a phone call at his pri-
vate re idence on the evening of 
March 18 from an unidentified 
caller who, according to the 
grievance report, aid," ive u 
back our club name or we will 
fucking kill you." 

"I'm really hocked because 1 
know that no one on m slate 
would do anything like this," aid 
Kevin hawn (!su, who i run-
ning as presidential candidate on 
the tudents Fir t! slate. 

Though Palisoul tOok the 
issue to the UC 0 campus 
police, he said he was tOld he 
would have to take It to the San 
Diego police and felt it was 
unnecessary to do o. However, 
he aid that he nonetheless took 
the issue seriou I y. 

"Being my first death threat, I 
think you have to take it eriou -
Iy. 1 don't know what the caller's 
intentions were," Palisoul said. 

Elections Manager Robin 
Shelton informed Palisoul that 

nowhere in

mended to

The Muir College Musical ensemble will 
present the musical comedy "Hoo to Succeed 
in Business Without Real~ Trying" at Mandeville 
Auditorium on April 10, April 11 and April 12 at

in 1961, is set In the 19505 and tells the tale 
of J. Pierrepont Finch's ascension from a win-
dow-washer to a high-pooered executive, by 
the process of satirizing the world of business 
through numerous suDplots. 

The ensemble's yearly productions are 
UCSO's only complete~ student-produced

Tickets are available at the UCSD Box 
Office, the Muir College Center and at the 
door, priced at $6 for students, $7 for staff 
and $8 for general admission. 

Researchers link crystal 
meth to cardiac damage 

UCSO researchers have found that hospi-
talized methamphetamine users shoo a sig-
nificantly higher rate of cardiac dysfunction 
than non-users, according to Ori Ben-Yuhada, 
assistant professor of medione and director 
of UCSO's Coronary Care Unit at the UCSD 
Medical Center. 

Ben-Yuhada and colleagues Nader Banki .. 
Neil Siecke, and Thomas Walbman decided to 
examine the effects of crystal · methampheta-
mine due to the pervasive use of the drug in 
San Oiego County. They reviewed the records 
of 76 patients and found that 64 percent 
showed normal heart function, compared with 
85 percent in an age-matched control group. 
Twenty-eight percent of the users exhibited 
moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction, 
compared to 7 percent in the control group. 

The study was comprised of patients from 
the teens to 50 years old, but WIth an average 
age of 41 to 43 years old. According to Ben-
Yuhada, It is unusual for people to show such 
levels of ventncular dysfunction at this age. 

The study was conducted because there 
had preV1ous~ been on~ anecdotal evidence 
for a lin between crystal methamphetamine 
use and cardiac damage, and because Iarger-
scale studies needed to be done to further 
understand the public health Implications, 
according to Ben-Yuhada.

Supreme Court hears 
affirmative action cases 

By PAUL THORNTON 
Doily Californian (U. (alifomia-

Berkeley) 
(V-WIRE) WASHlNGTON, 

O.c. - The U.S. Supreme Court 
heard oral arguments April 1 in two 
cases that could settle once and for 
all the extent to which colleges can 
consider race in their admissions. 

Outside the court, thousands 
demonstrated in support of affir-
mative action. 

Both cases involved the 
University of Michigan - Gratz 
v. Bollinger in the university's 
undergraduate admissions system, 
and Gmlt" v. Bollinger in the uni -
versity's law school. 

Although the case were pro-
voked by college admissions sys-
tems, the court's decision could 
indirectly affect hiring and gov-
ernment contracting programs 
that consider race. 

The court is being asked to 
decide whether affirmative action 
serves a "compelling state inter-
est" or violates the U.S . 
Constitution's 14th Amendment, 
which provides equal protection 
under the law. 

Much of the legal confusion 
surrounding affirmative action 
stems from the court 's 1978 deci-
sion of Univmity of California 
Board of Rtgtflts v. BaHt, in 
which the court ruled that col-
leges could not use admis ions 
quotas. 

Colleges could still use minor-
ity status as a "plus factor," howev-
er, so long as diversity i in the 
compelling interest of the state, 
according to the decision.

plaintiffs Barbara Gruner and 
Jennifer Gratz, argued the 
University of Michigan and its law 
school violated his clients' "indi-
vidual right nor to be discriminat-
ed against." 

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 
the likely swing vote on the nine-
member court, firmly asserted 
that making deci~ions in which to 
admit students is inherent in the 
college admissions system, espe-
cially when a university receive 
many more applications than it 
has spots. 

" This is of enormous 
importance not just to 
higher education but to 

the country as a whole. " 
- John Payton. Univ. of Michipn 

attorney 

O'Connor said that Kolbo's 
argument amounted to the fact 
that race cannot be used as one of 
"many factors" in admissions. 

"You've got some precedents 
you've got to come to grips with 
out there," O'Connor said to 
Kolbo, referring to the court's 
Baltkt decision. 

Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist and Ju tice Antonio 
Scalia, both considered conserva-
tive, pressed the University of 
Michigan lawyers about how close 
the university'S affirmative action 
ystem came to racial quotas, 

banned under the Bakke decision. 
Michigan tries to enroll a "crit-

ical mass" of minority students 
that improves the education of all 
students, said university attorney 
Maureen Mahoney. 

Determining what percentage 
minority enrollment the school 
needs to create a critical mass 
could be tantamount to setting a 
quota, argued justices Scalia and 
Anthony Kennedy. 

"Is it 8 percent? 12?" Scalia 
asked . 

John Payton, the lawyer repre-
senting Michigan in Gratz v. 
Bolling", argued the universi ty's 
a ffirmarive action system serves 
the compelling interest of the 
state. 

"This is of enormous impor-
tance not just to higher education, 
but to the country as a whole," 
Payton said. 

U.S. Solicitor Ceneral Ted 
Olson argued on behalf of the 
United States that Michigan's 
affirmative action system failed 
every test of legality. 

Michigan'S admissions system 
creates a "separate path and sepa-
rate door for preferred minori-
ties," Olson said. 

Olson said Michigan admits all 
"preferred minorities" who meet 
its minimum criteria but denies 
admission to many white students 
who exceed the qualifications. 

Many who supported affirma-
tive action har hly criticized the 
Bush administration for involving 
the solicitor general. 

" I am so ashamed of my gov-
ernment .. . to have the solicitor

IRV: Task force says instant 
runoff voting is more efficient 

continued from page I 
place votes, he or she wins the elec-
tion, just as he or she would under 
the plurality voting system. 
However, if no candidate receives 
more than 50 percent of the first-
place votes, the candidate who 
received the least number of first-
place votes is eliminated, and each 
vote belonging to that candidate is 
transferred to his or her voters' sec-
ond choices. This process contin-
ues until a candidate has received 
over 50 percent of the votes. 

Supporters of IRV claim that 
the voting system is more democ-
ratic than the current system 
because it means that a candidate 
must garner a true majority of the 
votes to win the election. 

"The biggest outcome [of 
implementing IRV] will be ensur-
ing that the candidate elected has 
the broadest base of support," said 
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Freshman Senator Max 
Harrington, who chaired the Task 
Force. 

IRV also better represents vot-
ers' sentiments by eliminating 
vote-splitting and third party 
"spoilers," allowing voters to vote 
their conscience, according to IRV 
advocates. 

"We wanted a system where 
voters can vote sincerely and not 
Strategically," Harrington said. 

However, several members of 
council raised concerns regarding 
IRV implementation. 

"My main concern was that 
[TRY) was going to be'too confus-
ing a system," said John Muir 
College Senior Senator and 
Senate Chair Corinne Hart, who 
voted against adopting IRV. "We 
have such a low voter turnout, 
anyways. Making lthe voting sys-

tem) different would discourage 
voting" 

In its presentation to the A.S. 
Council, members of the task force 
contended that IRV would increase 
voter turnout because it better rep-
resents students. It would also lead 
to campaigns with more debate 
because more powerful candidates 
and slates will be more apt to 
address issues raised by smaller 
candidates and slates due to their 
increased prospect of winning elec-
tions. 

During its presentation, the 
task force reported findings from 
its Jan. 28 and Feb. 21 mock elec-
tions on Library Walk. The task 
force reported that out of over 
100 students polled , 81 percent 
felt that IRV represented them, 
and most people polled felt it was 
the best voting system out of 
approval, Condorcet and plurality 
voti ng. 

However, Hart questioned the 
actual representation provided in 
the task force 's poll. 

"The survey used was [of] less 
than I percent of the student 
body," Hart said. "That was not 
enough evidence for me to change 
the entire voting system at 
VCSD." 

The Voting Systems Task 
Force was composed of an A.S. 
senator from each UCSD college 
and four at-large members from 
the student body and was dis-
solved upon completion of its rec-
ommendations. However, mem-
bers of the task force are currently 
advocating the implementation of 
IRV in college councils and meet-
ing with tudentLinlc representa-
tives to discuss the logistics of 
online IRV voting, according to 
Harrington.

This is not intended to pass judgment on

Democracy without choice amonp candi-

Irony is also apparent here. In a year 
when the council's most heated debate was 
on the i ue of whether commissioners 
hould be elected by students or appointed 

by the A . . pre idem, even commi ioners 
have e sentially appoInted them elves. In a 
year when one of the council's most ambi-
tious projects was the exploration and 
installation of a new votin~ system for cam-
pus elections, the vote is Irrelevant in nine 
of the 12 races. 

The Guardian encourages student to 
pay attention to ti,'! competitive races for 
president, vice president internal, vice pres-
Ident finance, and the many college enator 
and college council positions across cam-
pus. And to everyone who may be consider-
mg running for office next year - please 
do.

War's economic impact a pressing issue 
Increased military spending spells financial fiasco 

By JESSICA LlNGEL 
AsSOCIate Opinion Editor 

It's easy to oppose Operation Iraqi 
Freedom because of 3 hatred for 
PreSIdent George Bush andlor any of 
the members of his cabinet. It's easy to 
oppose the war because of the 10 of 
human life, or a belief in pacifism or 
even becau e of the looming diplomat-
ic di asters that have resulted from the 
bungling of the UN resolutions. 

But there are other, more disturb-
Ing consequences lurlang behind pro-
testers ' sIgn and between the lines of 
angry s peeche~ of worned !tberal . 
Perhaps one of the mmt prc~clent and 
fn ghtem ng reasom for belllg against 
the " ar with Iraq IS nel ther per onal 
nor moral, but financial. 

DespIte the fact that no one In the 
government was able to gwc even a 
rough e tJmate of the EOSt of the war 
before Imlltary action W;lS taken, after 
the fir t bomb fell , Bush was able to 
come up WIth a $75 bIllion pnce tag. 
That )pells bad news not only for the 
IraqI people who WIll see theIr land 
pulverized, but also for the U.S. CIti-
zens who WIll be left payIng for a 
reconstructed Iraq. 

Although the UnHed States IS inar-
guably the greatest urulateral power m 
the history of the world, it IS also WIth-
out a doubt the greatest debtor. As a 
country, it is living beyond its means, 
heavJly dependent on foreign debtOrs 
and Importing more than it exports. 
The debt Amenca owe abroad ha 
now reached $2 trllhon. That's 20 per-
cent of the GOP. It's entirely possIble. 
that foreign debt could tOP 65 percent 
of the GOP by 2010. 

The SItu2DOn was grim before the 
war In Iraq, and now it's looking wor c. 
Conservanves estimate the cost of the 
war and of rebuilding Iraq, over a 10-
year penod, at anywhere from $156 
bIllion to $755 bdllon . The key word In 
that phrase IS 'conservative;' other esu -

" Despite the fact that no one 
in the government was able 

to give even a rough estimate 
of the cost of the war before 
military action was taken, 
after the first bombs feU, 

Bush was able to come up 
with a $75 billion price tag." 
mates have run as high as $3 trillion, 
and those are before economists have 
even had a month to gauge just what 
kind of damage is to be done to U .S. 
uoops - and the economy. 

In the 1991 Gulf war, most of the 
cost was paid by other coulluies -
many nations ubstituted money for 
troops in the Internanonal coahtion 
agamst Saddam. But that was in a ltu -
ation where do~en of nauons were 
wlllmg to lend theIr upport . Sierra 

Leone sent 20 (unarmed) police offi -
cers to join the cause. Even Syria was 
on the side of the United States, 

This time around, the United States 
will have to bear mo t of the burden. 
Unless new taxes arc instated, it would 
take $200 billion annually for the 
United State imply to finance the 
foreign debt. Dreary statistics, and they 
could perhaps become a great deal 
drearier. 

The Bush administration has gener-
ated enough international oppoSItIOn 
to effectively limit the amount of finan -
cial support that can be expected. And 
the fewer allies, bases and air Tlght~ 
that the United States ha" the higher 
the CO\ts will be 1/1 Amencan Ii\'es and 
the higher the pnce WIll be. The coun -
try will not only pay for the war, hut 
the postwar recon,tructlon as well. 
Within the first week of war, every 
major airfield In Iraq ha\ been bombed 
to destruction . Th.H WJ\ one week . 
The longer thIS war drag' on, the high -
er the cOSts will be, And there wdl be 
few partiC3 willmg to foot thc 0111. 

Perhaps the blgge,t ca;,ualty of 
peraoon Iraqi Freedom will be the 

economy. If Bush's $75 bdlton request 
IS granted, the dramatic II1crease 111 
debt could result 10 a fall of dIe dollar 
that would both reduce U.S. e onomlc 
standard and Significantly II1crcase the 
COSt of projecti ng U.S. power abroad . 
And plausible solutions to the impend-
ing cri is are Just a gloomy as the 
problem itself. 

Really, the only way to avoid this 
scenario is to raise taxes, which will 
also to some extent reduce living stan -
dards. Such an alternative is all but 
doomed to failure against a Republican 
congress, Senate and White House. 

h would be a humor of the darkest 
kind If the war that wa undertaken 
under the preten e of a police sta te'

Thoughts on war unconventional 
stop 
that! 

Bertrand Fan 

W ar has always been a touchy subject with my family. 
One of my earliest memories is 

an unfortuna te incident with my 
sister. I had shuffled the deck, eyed 
about half of it and given it to her, 
when she refused to take her ha lf. 

"Bullshit," she sai d, "your half's 
bigger." 

I explained to her that it didn't 
matter, that war itself was unfair, 
and after a few minutes one of us 
would have a bigger half anyways. 

"But, at least that person would 
have ea rned that half," 

"Earned ?!" I asked . 
You don't earn your bigger half 

in war; you just draw it. There's no 
slapping involved, no quick draw-
ing necessary, it's just a matter of 
having high cards at the time, and 
in the event of a war, having high 
cards in the future. But this logic 
did not carry over to her, and she 
forced me to redea l, painstakingly 
dealing out 26 cards each. It took 
away some precious moments of 
my life that I will never get back, 
moments that I could have spent 
thinking about other moments of 
my life that I will never get back, 
like when I rented "Maid in 
Manhattan" after a night of bloody 
marys on the premise that I'd find 
"the worst movie in Long's Drugs." 

I've told this story in response 
to friends' inquiries about my feel-
ings on war, but they insisted that 
this isn't what they meant, After 
careful consideration, I realized 
they were talking about another 
war altogether, which I like to 

ALEX AVERBUKH , 
ATHLETE , TEL-AVIV 

refer to as a thumb war. 
I remember my first thumb war 

with my girlfriend . We were sitting 
on her couch, discussing whether 
or not you can smell sneezes. My 
position was that sneezes have 
smells, and that everybody'S 
sneezes smelled the same, while she 
claimed that you couldn't smell 
sneezes. She is clearly wrong 
because I 've smel led many a 
sneeze, and I've even gone as far as 
to smell other people's snec~es, 
which, though disgusting as hell , 
smell the same 3S my sneezes. 

Trying to be 3 good sport about 
her being so obviously wrong, I 
suggested a thumb war. She 
ab'Teed, and assumed the thumbs-
up position with her right hand. I 
wrapped my fingers around hers, 
said the customary, "One, two, 
three, four, I declare a thumb war," 
while moving my thumb opposite 
hers, and then the minute the 
word "war" had left my mouth, she 
started twisting her arm like 3 Thai 
hooker on speed. I quickJy lost the 
first game o ut of pure shock. 

"What, in the fuck, was that?" I 
demanded. 

"It's not against the rules," she 
retorted. 

"Of cour e it's not in the rules! 
Why the hell would your arm and 
elbow be in the rules in a thumb 
war?! Everybody knows that you 
don 't move your god damn wrist 
in a thumb war." 

"Look, it's not against the 
rules, all right?" 

"All right." I conceded and put 
out my hand. We started the count 
and right when it was over I 
punched her in the boob with my 
left hand, and a she screamed some 
things ( can', print here, I covered 
her thumb with mine and won the 
second battle. Me getting punched 
in the balls was the tiebreaker. 

Let's face it, people do get hurt 

in wars, no matter wbat side you're 
on. Take the war on cavities I've 
been fighting most of my life. 
Sometimes, when it's really late and 
I want to pass Out, whether or not 
to brush my teeth is a difficult deci-
sion . The amount of wrist effort is 
considerable, and no matter how 
much masturbation I conduct 
purely to strengthen my wrist, the 
fact remains that I'm one lazy s.o.b. 

I even have an electric tooth-
brush; aliI would really have to do 
is stand there and hold the damn 
thing for two minutes, but I'm 
sure we 've all been there. 
Sometimes standing is just too dif-
ficult . A littl e while back, one of 
my friends had to have su rgery on 
his ass because he supported this 
idea too much, 

I remember once I was taking 
this survey in high school that 
helped you calculate when you 
were going to die. I think the pri-
mary purpose was to discourage 
smoking, but the part that really 
stuck in my mind was the one that 
asked if you sat in a chair more 
than eight hours a day. At fi rst I 
marked "no," but then I really 
thought about it and I can't recall 
the last day where I didn't sit in a 
chair less than eight hours. In 
between moving furniture and dis-
assembling IKEA lamps with allen 
wrenches, I would sit in the U-
Haul on my leather chair and think 
about what it would be like to sit in 
my new home. 

I have really been fighting a 
war against stand ing, and it is sort 
of a joint conflict with the war 
against the sun, in which I'm cur-
rently being supported by my 
good buddy, shade. He really kicks 
the sun's ass when they duke it out.

According to Palisoul, the 
tudents First! club had also been 

expecting a grievance filed 
against Kevin Hsu by the 
Students First! slate for using the 
title "Students First!" in his cam-

The grievance filed by

The purpose of the club, as 
outlined in 1998, wa "for stu-

with issues related to students 
and politics." Currently, the out-
line states that its purpose is: "to 
prevent extremists from abusing 
the A.S. Council; preserve 
integrity of democracy at UCSD; 
and to advocate for student 
issues, through publicity, satire, 
and public awareness campaigns." 

"Demonstrating the absurd by 
being absurd: That's to summa-
rize our club," Palisoul said . 
"Basically part of demonstrating 
the absurd by being absurd is 
you've got to do things that are 
going to get attention, and for the 

last couple of 
years people have 
known the name 
Students First!."

Palisoul has also 
alleged that 
members of the

to drop out of the

the only member 
that identified 
himself was

the outside. 

However, no 
official grievances have been filed 
on this ma tter. 

Neither Kevin Hsu nor 
Nandogopal were available for 
comment by press time. 

According to Palisoul, the 
tudents First! club is currently 

considering filing an additional 
grievance against the Students 
First! slate for using the ame 
name for the late as that of their 
organization. 

The u e of the name Students 
First! has been in u e over past 
year by late on college campus-
es acro the nation, and was used 
at UC D in last year's elections 
by current A.S. president Jenn 
Brown. 

The club named tudents

ludent Organizations & 

LeadershIp Opportunrties In 
1998, but was not re-registered 
until January 2003. S.O.L.O. 
clubs must be re-registered every 
year, but can be revived by any 

"We with aUf 
firm belief are trying to do what-
ever is possible to get new ideas 
into A.S., and the best way to do 
tha t was to take a name every-
body knew and use it as an orga-
nization and cause a commotion," 
Palisoul said. 

Palisoul is listed as a principle 
member of the rudcnts First! club 
alongside Ryan Darby, Everly 
Mariano and Bryan Barton. The 
latter is also running as an inde-
pendent presidential candidate in 
thiS year's elections. Kevin Hsu 
falls under general membership, 
which, according to Palisoul, 
includes about 30 other members. 

Kevin Hsu's candidate slate-
ment, which has been issued in this 
year's sample ballots, states that he 
has "held the following posltiClns

Many of the unopposed candi-

"I still want people to vote for

find time to

Projects include senior class reunions, council exchanges 
By LAUREN RAU 

Staff Writer 

Unbeknownst to many UCSD 
srudents, each of the six colleges 
requires their senators on A.S. 
Council to complete a project for 
each year they serve in office. The 
parameters are not very specific; it 
only needs to be a project intended 
for the betterment of the university. 

As Eleanor Roosevelt College'S 
senior senator, Wendy Ho partici-
pates in many projects. Among her 
favorites is a program she starred 
this fall to bring together the ERC 
seniors living off-campus. 

"You know once you move off 
campus, you just don't see a lot of 
the people anymore," Ho said. "I 
wanted to reconnect people, and 
just enjoy ourselves and have a 
good time." 

According to Ho, the happy 
hour social held at TGI Friday's in 
February was extremely well-
attended. About 60 or 70 ERC 
se niors attended the evening 
event. 

"Everyone who attended really 
loved it," Ho said. "So many people 
came up to me and said it was like a 
reunion of our freshman year." 

Ho also organized a finals 
break at EI Cerrito in March that 
was also successful, if not as well-
attended . Potential future plans 
include a trip to a Padres game and 
a night at Dave and Buster's. 

"The program is run by a com-
mittee of five random seniors, 
including myself," Ho said . 

"These people aren't senators, just 
seniors who decided they have an 
hour to spare in their week. 
Starting this quarter, we are trying 
to recruit more volunteers to help 
organize the upcoming events ." 

John Muir College Sophomore 
Senator Jeremy Cogan developed 
a project within the college coun-
cil systems, the Senator Exchange 
Program. 

"This was something 1 kind of 
invented because I 

" 

college they visited and wrote a 
hort, follow-up report. Cogan 

encouraged people not just to 
praise, but to offer constructive 
criticism as well. 

"I received a lot of comments 
to the effect of, ' this was terrific,' 
and 'thanks for setting thi up,''' 
Cogan said. "It was a big success." 

A concrete example of the pro-
gram's impact is the fact that the 
Thurgood Marshall College 

Student Council 
saw so much rivalry 
between the di ffer-
em colleges last fall 
quarter," Cogan 
said. "The college 
councils shouldn't 
compete with each 
other; they should 
help each other as 
the leaders of each 
college." 

The college councils 
shouldn't compete 

with each other; they 
should help each 

has since adopted 
a positive way of 
closing their 
meetings that they 
learned from a vis-
itor from Earl 
Warren College 
Student Council. 
In addition, 
according to 
Cogan, Warren 
council members 
learned how other 
colleges such as 
Muir handled 
their budget that 
in turn gave them 

The exchange 
program took place 
during the second 
and third weeks of 
winter quarter. 
Cogan coordinated 

~l_ " 
OUIeT ... 

with each of the councils to have 
twO members excused 10 exchange 
for two visitors during both of the 
meetings. 

"The goal was for all panici-
pants to experience aspects of a 
different college," Cogan said . 
"We all have the same basic inter-
ests, which are parking, student 
organizations and just general stu-
dent interests." 

Each partici pant analyzed the 

fresh ideas for their recen t 
restructuring. 

In a similar effort to Ho's senior 
program, Warren Junior Senator 
Jessica Kepford initiated a 
Commuter Outreach Program for 
Warren College. Kepford saw a lack 
of progranuning focused on the 
Warren commuters, as this is her 
second year commuting to school.

on the 'NO on CRENO' cam-

According to the minutes for a 
Students First! club meeting held 
on March 5, each of these positions 
was created on that same day, after 
Kevin Hsu publicly announced to 
the club his intention to run for 
A.S . presidency. Following Kevin 
Hsu' announcement, Palisoul 
announced that each of tI,ese posi-
tions needed to be created, and 
they were sub equently voted on 
and passed by the club's member 
in attendance, and accepted by 
Kevin Ilsu.

Kevin Shawn Hsu, who current-
ly erves a vice president mternal 
on the A.S. ouncil, pent two 
years serving as Earl \,yarren 
College freshman and sophomore 
enator to the A.S. Council, among 

other positions similar to the posi-
tions created by the tudents First! 
club. 

Palisoul said that while Kevin 
Ilsu is a Revelle student, they 
nominated him as the club's 
"Warren Freshman & ophomore 
Senator" for lack of Warren Stu-
dents in the club. 

"We come up with positions 
every day," Palisoul said. "Someone 
says, 'Phil, I've got th is great posi-
tion idea.' I say, 'What is it?' They 

say, 'I want to be rudents First! 
A. . Commissioner of Aviary 
Concerns on Campu .' \Ve put It to 
a vote, and it usually pa se unani-
mously." 

Other positions created on t>larch 
5 include a second po ition for 
"Director of linority Outreach" 
and a position for "Muir Freslurulll 

enator," both accepted by club 
member John A1tic,," who is rwming 
as independent candidate for Muir 
sophomore senator and who includ-
ed the position in his candidate state-

week," Kepford said. "We gave 
people free appetizers and about 
150 people showed up each time." 

Acco~JlOg to Kepford , a free 
commuter breakfast was also dis-
tributed on Library Walk. The 
event was successful, with about 
250 participants. H owever, 
Kepford speculated that everyone 
who took a breakfast burrito was 
potentially not from Warren. 

Kepford also leamed up with 
Warren Senior Senator Lauren Lee 
to rewrite the Warren College elec-
tion bylaws. The effort was part of 
a larger effort last quarter to change 
Warren College Student Council. 

"We put together a 
Constitutional Redraft 
Committee," Kepford said. "The 
constirution and bylaws have been 
completely restructured." 

According to Kepford, this was 
not a senator project, but was a 
good example of the overlap that 
frequently occurs between their 
duties as council members and 
their individual projects. 

Lee's favorite senator project 
was a last-minute affair that she 
arranged in September 200 I. With 
the help of the A.S. Council sup-
port staff, Lee organized a candle-
light vigil during the first week of 
school to commemorate the vic-
tims of 9/11 . 

"It was an awkward time for a 
lot of us," Lee said. "I felt like peo-
ple were in this bind of t1ealing 
with the tragedy and starting the 
school year, especially the incom-
ing freshmen ."

else in my slate," said unopposed 
candidate for Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs and member of 
the Students First l sla te Perse 
Hooper. "I believe in my slate and 
I'll do what I can to support them." 

Even for independent ca ndidate 
Jordan Cross , who is running 
unopposed for commissioner of 
athletics, having the prearranged 
assurance still means that cam-
paigning goes as planned. 

"My approach to the campaign 
will be just as serious as it were a 
contested election," Cross said. 

Candidates have also expressed 
concern about the widespread lack 
of opposition and what it means to 
the campus community. 

"I think that it says a lot about 
campus and a lack of community," 
Hooper said. "Srudents should be 
involved and know that they do 
have power." 

Similar to A.S. Council POSI-
tions, some college council offices 
are also uncontested. 

"I would have liked to see com-
petition as it aids in ensuring the 
right candidate is in office," said 
John Muir College Commissioner 
of Records candida te Amanda 
Hulsizer. "As far as how my cam-
paign is going to be run, it will be 
run as close as POSSI ble to a cam-

More than just a 'Porn Star' 
New DVD explores the life and times of Ron Je 

The hedgehog: fat, hairy, sweaty and, to be quite honest, hung. Ron Jeremy is a man who has 
the name and face recognition 
(amongst other things) that few 
other than conventional movies 
stars ever receive. Yet, this IS a man 
who exists on the fringes of the 
entertainment society in the poorly 
lit and increasingly poorly wrinen 
world of adult films . " Porn Star: 
The Legend of Ron Jeremy," is a 
documentary that delves into the 
life of man who's effigy ha become 
synonymous with sex , but who 
wants to be known for more than 
Ius exceptional endowment. 

G iven Jeremy's many main-
stream bit parts, such as in 
UOrgasmo," and cult status thanks 
to his thousands of adult films with 
ti tl es as classy and tasteful as " gt. 
Pecker 's Lonely Hearts Club Gang 
Bang," Jeremy's slow creep into the 
ma msn eam seems utterly 
Inevitable, and tills film comes off 
as one of hIS many endeavor Into 
the legttimized entertamment fiel d. 

The fi lm Itself is a surpriSingly 
emoaonal look In to a man who is 
Idolized by fans for Ius role In well 
over 1,600 adult fi lms (and an even 
greater number of ~e.\'uaJ parmer,) 
The pIcture that develops IS a com-
plex one, reveling many JOYs, 
deSIres, dreams, fa llurc~ and pains 
of a hu man being, one that happens 
to have sex In front 0 a massive 
audIence for a liVing. 

At ames, Jeremy seems compul-
sive and ob eSSlve, working con-
stantly on many di fferent fields 
adult films, Hollywood films, music 

\'Ideo~, trade shows and stand up 
acts amongst others. \ \ 'e catch 
glimpse 's of hiS ma sive Journal 0 
people, their phone numbers, and 
how they relate to each other, a 
taped together lllnder that Jeremy 
hJS been carrpng for almost twcn-
ty vear" Each name connect to 
oth~r name~ to give tlle porn star 3 
qUick reference as to where he 
know the per,on and what they 
can do for Ius career. The screen 
shots of tills tome IS mind boggli ng, 
covered In hundreds of name , sep-

arated by cities and states; this is a 
man who lets no one, ever, pas 
through his fingers . 

Jeremy travels constantly, and 
from what is revealed by the film, 
probably most days of the year he is 
coming or going for his many dif-
ferent gigs. He claims to travel so 
much that those who wish to book 
him have trouble paying for his air 
fare because he doesn't know where 
he will be coming from . "Porn 
Star" takes us to many diverse loca-
tions; the taping of a Kiss music 
video for "Detroit Rock City," a 
H o llywood party, hi honorary 
inducoon into a frat and even on 
stage with Kid Rock. 

All this is not simply a narcissis-
tic drive, but something else entire-
ly; perhaps it is Jeremy's desire to 
leave the adult business. He open-
ly conjectures that he might lead 
such a hectic life style to make up 
for Ius lack of romanoc connec-
oons. OftenJ eremy speaks to the 
camera like a child, faSCinated 
by hiS O\\TI stardom, gratefu l 
an d in awe of what he ha 
accomplished, but other 
omes, he shows that there IS 
more to who Ron Jeremy 
\\ anted ro be: he Jlwa~'S want-
ed to be a legtOmate actor. 

Formally, "Porn Star" is an ae -
thencally plea Ing presentation. the 
edltlng IS well crafted, sprinting 
back and fourth between narra tives 
of Ron's youth, h is entrance into 
porn, err .. . adult fil m and his life 
as he hves It now. The Juxtaposltlo n 
reveals much that you would not 
expec t about the erugm atic and 
exposed tar. There IS a sense of 
loneliness constructed by the sheer 
number of women Jeremy ha lept 
With and the few that he actually 
has maintained an emononal con-
necnon to, other nmes he seem 
enthusIastiC to be living hIS life the 
way he does, even if It IS hectic

the version ti tled "The Legend of

any actual pornography in "Porn 
Star." There are certainly many 
naked, or at least bare chested 
women, and a few men as well, but 
the film stops far from becoming 
steamy, maintaining an odd sense of 
decorum even as they follow Jeremy 
and try to capture his preparations 
for an on-screen encounter.

The next wave of the indie 
rocking 'Shoegaze' is born 
The Stratford 4 and Longwave breathe 
new life into an aging, early '90s genre 

By BillY GIL 
Staff Writer 

While a host of uberhyped rock bands enjoy the spotlight by digging up the graves of dated styles such as post-
punk and garage rock, a new batch of bands 
indebted to the early '90s style of "shoegaze" 
rock is emer ging. Along with the Black Rebel 
Motorcycle Club and the Raveonenes, two 
new bands, San Francisco's Stratford 4 and 
New York's Longwave, are enjoying growing 
popularity with their excellent second 
albums. 

Dubbed "shoegaze" by the press from the 
bands' icy stage presence, the movement 
took its cues from '80s noise-poppers the 
Jesus and Mary Chain and ethereal crooners 
Cocteau 1wins. It crystallized with the band 
My Bloody Valentine and its seminal 1991 
album "Loveless," which was widely regard-
ed as a modern masterpiece of swirling, 
crashing guitars and dreamy vocals. 
" Loveless" nearly sunk their label, Creation, 
after it failed to make a commercial break-
th rough. Still, the album and the band 
proved to be infinitely in fl uential, spawning a 
legion of followers such as Ride, Slowdive 
and Lush, who each displayed original takes 
on the sound and toole. it to new heights. 
Blockbuster rockers like Garbage and the 
Smashing Pumpkins also declared their love 
for the band and the movement they helped 
pawn. 

By the time irvana brought grunge into 
the United tates and Suede and Oasis 
brought Britpop to the Umted Kingdom, the 
two genres were essenoally dead. These two 
aibulll~, however, are breathing new life into 
the genres. While friends BRMC are thor-
oughly indebted to the squall of theJ esus and 
M ary Chain, the tratford 4 take on less 
noisy, more pop-Oriented Influences. "Love 
and Distoroon" IS a terrifically catchy batch 
of songs that are sure to plea e anyone with a 
jones for pop melodies drenched in sun-
baked distorted guitars. The opener "Where 
the Ocean Meets the Eye" bounces sleepily 
on a My Bloody Valentine bass line only to 

be demolished by the next song, the stomp-
ing "She Married the Birds." Vocalist Chris 
Streng si ngs "r went to confession, and I had 
nothing to confess" over Stones-inspired rif-
fery in a hook that latches on subtly and 
lingers for days. 

Whereas the band's debut, "The Revolt 
Against Tired Noises," was charming but 
meandering, "Love and Distortion" is pretty 
uniformly solid. The trak " 12 Months" gets 
surprisingly folksy, while "The Simple 
T hings are Taking Over" starts slow and 
builds to a thunderous chorus with Smashing 
Pumpkins-l ike guitar chords and passionate 
vocals. Other high points include the joyful 
pop tunc, "Kleptophilia," about, well, k1ep-
tophilia, and "Telephone," in which Streng 
confesses his insecurities to his mother, who 
tells him "when I was twenty-two, I was a lot 
lile.e you" in the spine-tingling chorus. She 
also tells him "there's more to life than the 
Stratford 4." Hopefully, Streng won't heed 
his mother's advice and keep writing delight-
fully insecure pop gems like this. 

The songs occasionally drone a bit tOO 
much, and bassist Shew Singh's lovely back-
up vocals are severely underused, but the 
booming guitars and lovesick melodies more 
than make up for such shortcomings. The 
Stratfotd 4 embark on tour with emo-popper 
Pedro the Lion and will likely hit Southern 
California in April or May. 

Longwave has the advantage of having 
more famous fri ends (the Strokes, whom 
they toured With) and a more commercial 
sound . The band still has Its share of guitar 
noise and dreamy vocals, but the songs are 
more conci e and pop- informed , draWing 
comparisons to early U2 and Radiohead. 
The opener, "Wake M e \\Then It's Over, " 
could be an ironiC reference to shoegaze's 
Criticism of bei ng too "sleepy," as it is cer-
ta inl y influenced by th e genre's sonic guitar 
landscapes. It also sounds a littl e too much 
like the o pening to the new album by like-
minded ew York band Interpol. But th e 
single, " Everywhere You Turn ," is pure

Is there really a 'liberal media' out there? Theater: 'Caberet' recreates decadence of 1930s Berlin 
Some Internet sites to expand your reading, and liven up your life COlllimjed from page B 

the show was the use of the sadly 
staring Kit Kat dancers listlessly 
watching the scenes of more direct 
importance to the plot roll by. By 
evoking the image of the city itself, 
namely the youth of Berlin, and 
watching and waiting with glazed-
over tares, the scene sent chills 
down the spine. UCSD students 
Victor Ha and Patrick 
McNaughton round out an out-
standing troupe of eight ensemble 
singers and dancers. Lizerre Kent 
also plays a hell of a trombone.

Q wre frankly, any news source that feel the need to claim "Fair, accurate, balanced" is a 
cause for question. Professional 
news journalism is supposed to be 
those tlungs; what they should be 
doing as a disseminator of Informa-
tion I making all attempts to pre-
sent the happenings on both sides 
of an argument. But few, if any, 
major news sources actually do this, 
and sa}'lng that a liberal media 
exists at aU is laughable after seeing 
the coverage Fox ews presents. 

We all know Fox' primary 
channel, the epicenter of sleaze for 
the networlt television; that's where 
we've been able to watch alarmist 
shows including, "Caught On 
Tape," "Cops," and "When Breast 
Implants Explode." Sure, we all 
have watched at least an episode of 
"American Idol," or perhaps even 
"Married By Amenca," but with the 
exception of a few other programs, 
the very reason the Fox name finds 
its way to our lips, is because of the 
inner rubber-necker in us. You see 
something gruesome; you flip the 
channel back, and watch. ow why 
would you go to thi same source 
for news) The fact is, you can't be 
balanced If you only present one 
side of the argument: case In point, 
Fox :-Jews IS 100 percent belund the

you go: In a ome of oghtly con-

criticizes the U.S. military policy oi 
bombing Iraqi TV as a violation of 
the Geneva Conventions, and that 
furthern10re it was a war crime to 
target a civi lian facility even if they 
are being used for propaganda 
(http://wv.rcJJjair:org/activimtliraqi-
tv.hrm/). 

Another Web site more than 
likely to . ncite frenzy is Memory 
H o I e , 
http://www.thtmrmoryholr.orglindt 
x.htm, which proclaims itself to be 
"rescuing knowl edge, freeing 
information." As such, they are a 
blending of news posting (gather-
ing and linJlung stories from a vari-
ety of sources), as well as links to 
information that might otherwise 
not be reached readily. 

Of the latter, there is the 
EO.l.A. logs, or the Freedom of 
Information Act request logs; 
which allow you to read what oth-
ers have requested from federal 
groups like the Department of 
Defense and their status, so if you 
have a claim you are going to malee, 
you can expedite the process. 

The musical is narrated, in a 
sense, by the master of ceremonies 
Oeremiah Lorenz). Through the 
epic songs, "Two Ladies," "Money" 
and "I Don't Care Much," the emcee 
evolves to represent the struggle and 
insanity that flooded Berlin in this 
time of evil-handed politics and civil 
unrest. Wonderfully perfonned on 
all counts, Lorenz captures the 
essence of each chapter of the onset 
of World War II - indifference, 
insane pleasure, acceptance and a 
most sincere, chilling fear. Lorenz 
achieves true theatrical perfection 
with his silent role during the child's 
(Michael Cullen) song "Tomorrow 
Belongs to Me." His physical pres-
ence and terrifying Gestapo boots 
shove the axe upon any remaining 
shred of hope that has lasted for 
peace and comfort for the world in 
1 930s. 

Noting the si ze of the North 
Coast Rep, how could they pull off 
a full -out musical - especially a 
show of such high repute? With 
the clever staging by director ean 
Murray, the general, yet crisp set

The art of beatboxlng. so 

much overlooked in good hip 
hop, is the art and skill of Rahzel 
from the Roots. Originally from 
the Bronx, Rahzel is the multi-tal-
ented man who sings, beats, 
bass. samples and throws in 
sound effects all at the same 
time. Maybe i~s in his blood, 
since hiS cousin Rahim performed 
with Grandmaster Flash and the 
Furious Five. To s e him, you 

won't be able to believe that I~S 
all coming out of one man, but it 
is and you'll have to see him live 
to comprehend how incredible it 
is. See him when he performs at 
the Belly Up Tavern at 9 p.m. 
Tickets are $15. For more infor-

give San Diego some of their 
good old-fasnioned jazz. The 
group's ImproVIsatIOnal funk has 
roots spanning from the funk of 
James Brown's '70s to the 
smooth jazz of Wes Montgomery. 
The group lhat consists of broth-
ers Alan and Neal Evans (drums 
and or~an, respectively) and gui-
tarist Enc Krasno. Their old school 
outfits and their great attitudes 
will leave the audience in an exot-
ed state, dancing to the Jazz 
instead of just listening to It; the 
way I~S supposed to be.

14 .PORTS 

Baseball: Tritons take three 
of four from Sonoma State 

coruinued from page ,6 
they put up three runs on four 
hits. 

Burton went 2-for-3 in the 
game with three stolen bases. 
Hernandez and Miller also con-
tributed two hit apiece in the 
nightcap. 

UCSD dropped the fourth 
game of the series to onoma 2-\' 

Triton freshman pitcher Justin 
Suarez got his first collegiate start 
in game four and gave up ju t two 
hits in six innings pitched. 

O'Brien was extremely pleased 
with the performances of his 
young pitchers. 

"It is great when you are suc-
cessful and three out of your four 
starters are freshman," he said. 
"Having young pitchers who 
throw well is important for this 
club right now and also for the 
future of the program." 

Tyler Smith (1-2) pitched 2.1 
innings, picking up the loss for 
UCSD. 

UCSD scored its first and 
only run of the game in the top of 
the fifth . 

Without a run through eight 
and a half innings, Sonoma State 
was able to score two runs in the 
final inning of the game to clinch 
their first victory of the series. 

In the four-game series, the 
TritOn scored 22 total runs and 
stole 20 bases. 

"We were successful because 
we excelled in the four aspects of 
the game that we emphasize: We 
pitched, played defense, swung 
the bat and ran the bases very 
well," O'Brien said. "We want to 
be better than the other team in 
tho e four areas and if we are, we 
are ucces ful." 

With the three victories 
against Sonoma, UCSD improves 
to 16- in the CCAA and 22-14 
overall, due to a win over 
Concordia 8-1 on March 26 and a 
loss to Vanguard 7-6 on April \. 

The conference victorie pro-
pel the Tritons into first place in 
the CCAA. The 24th-ranked 
Tritons are now a game ahead of 
the Seawolves in the league. 

"The wins were very impor-
tant," O'Brien aid. "But what 
was more important though was 
that our guys went up and played 
very well. They didn't focus on 
who they were playing. They just 
played solid baseball." 

UCSD squares off against San 
Francisco State at Triton Baseball 
Field in a four-game series begin-
ning at 2:30 pm on April 4 and 
concluding on April 6. 

Fencing: UCSD's Runyan 
takes 18th place at nationals 

conunued from page 16 
to defeat the fencer who eventu-
ally finished in second place. 

"J eremy IS very gifted and very 
fast, there is a strong chance of 
him bemg an AlJ-Amencan next 
vear," Lee said. 
. MUIr didn't fare as well, firush-
109 last among the women at 
nationals, but she still managed to 
fimsh " 'Ith multiple Vlctone~. 

"Lauren fenced above her level, 

and scored on everyone she faced . 
I think the experience was a very 
positive one for her," Lee said. 

The Tritons are a young team 
with II of their I starters being 
fre hman. Regardless, they till 
managed to place second in con-
ference. Lee views thIS as a 
rebUIlding year and IS loolung 
forward to more expenence next 
year, a well as some prOlnising 
recrUIts.

Triton track speeds by competition 
Both Triton teams take first in regional meet 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

By the time the dust cleared off 
the field, the UCSD men's and 
women's track and field teams had 
come to recognize their growth, 
with victories against several tough 
competitors in the San Diego State 
Aztec Invitational and the UCSD 
Spring Break Challenge. 

The San Diego State Aztec 
Invitational was highlighted by sev-
eral school record-breaking and 
NCAA provisional qualifying per-
formances for the Tritons, who 
dominated a number of Division I 
schools along the way. 

"There was a pretty broad range 
of competition, with over 1,000 
entries," said UCSD head coach 
Tony Salerno. 

This meet was underscored 
with potent performances by 
seniors Jackie Vu in the pole vault 
and Audrey Sung in the 1,500-
meter race, both of whom strove to 
make a lasting impact at UCSD, 
and delivered. 

An All-American, Sung's time in 
the 1,5OO-meter nee, a red-hot 
4:33 .50, wowed spectators; her 
time was not only NCAA provi-
sional qualifying, but also the No. 2 
all-time performance at UCSD. 

Sung surged ahead of Division I 
runners from SDSU and USD, 
among others, and finished only 
behind Genevieve Ermeling 
(4:33.44) of Puro Pro, a club team. 
Following her lead was Sung's 
sophomore teammate Lindsay 
Stalker, who took sixth (4:47.88). 

"Solid performances were made 
in the distance events, especially in 
the 1,5005," Salerno said. 

Vu is another athlete whose 
exhibition, though ranked seventh 
at the meet, captured the No. 2 all-
time performance at UCSD, and 
whose jump in the women's pole 
vault of II '5" was a NCAA qualify-
ing performance as well. 

The jumpers were also stand-
outs, with high jumper Briana 
Hinga's 5'2" jump talcing UCSD's 
No. 10 all-time ranking, and 
Kaylin Siever capturing the No. 8 

all-time posItion with her triple 
jump of 36'9.75". 

Consistently strong perfor-
mances were also made by thrower 
Sagrario Hernandez and jumper 
Kendra Canape, among others. 

The men's team also made 
progress, particularly in the sprints, 
long distance races and throws. 
This was despite the fact that the 
"team was a little tired from finals, 
and only three-fourths of the team 
was entered," Salerno said. 

Freshmen sprinting teammates 
C). Lawrence and Jon Patton ran 
side-by-side, securing the ninth 
and lOth positions in their 200-
meter dash heat, clocking in at 
22 .64 and 22 .67, respectively. 
Freshman Matt Horner finished 
ninth with a time of 50.62 in the 
4OO-meter race. 

Long distance races were tud-
ded with strong Triton perfor-
mances. The 1,5OO-meter race saw 
junior John Morrison and senior 
Dave Dunbar nab the sixth and

recover from four Aussie goals in the second period, 
and dropped a 7-4 decision. 

Against Long Beach State, the Tritons outplayed 
the 4gers during quarters one, two and four; but the 
four goals given up by UCSD in the third proved to 
be decisive in the 8-6 loss. The Tritons remained a 
goal behind in the fourth, but could not find the 
equalizer before LBSU put the game away with 32 
seconds lefr. Tucker led the UCSD coring drive with 
two goals. 

With big games against UC Davis and CSU 
Bakersfield on April 5, the Tritons hope to patch up 
some of the leaky quarters that have been plaguing 
some of their games. 

"These [conference] games are important," said 
UCSD head coach Larry Sanders. "It's time to fine-
rune our game and play up to the level we need to be 
3r." 

Before the day was up, the Tnton would have to 
play catch-up again; th is time falling behind to 
Hawaii 5- 1 at halftime and fini shing with a heart-
breaking 8-6 loss. De pite coming up with three goals 
to cut the Rainbow Wahine lead to one, the Tmons 
had deja vu when they were again unable to come up 
with the tying goal before the game was sealed by a 
late Hawaii goal. 

UCS D's high-octane game sprung back to life for 
the March 29 match against Santa Cruz. Aher the 
Banana Slugs took their only lead of the sea. on 
against the Tritons early in the second period, UCSD 
pm up eIght unanswered goals to take a big victory 
over UC C, 10-2 . 

The Tritons finished out the tournament with two

leader onoma tate last weekend. 
The Tritons took three out of four 
games from the eawolves, win-

"[Navarro] set the tone for us 
With a great outing in the first 
game,H UCSD head coach Dan 
O'Bnen said. 

UCSD scored early in the 
game, but it wasn't until the ev-
enth inning that the Tritons 
exploded and tacked on four runs 
in the inning to take control of the 
game. Hits from designated hitter 
Damian Fante and third baseman 
Matt Merrifield, combined with 
walks drawn by center fielder Matt 
Smith and catcher/first baseman 
Jeff Riddle, enabled the Tritons to 
pull ahead and secure the game-
one victory. 

Fante went 3-for-5 with two 
doubles, Merrifield went 2-for-5, 
and RJddle finished 2-for-4 in the 
game with a double. Right fielder 
Brett Bunon and shortstop Keith 
Hernandez also had doubles in 
game one. 

On March 29, 10 the first game 
of a double header, the second 
game of the senes, the Tmons put 
up five runs 10 the first two mrungs 
of the game. 

In the second ml1lng, UCSD 
center fielder DaVid Hawk and ec-
ond baseman Igel 1t1ler smgled, 
and then Burton doubled again to 
dnve 10 twO runs. 'The Tnton 
scored two addloonal runs 10 the 
top of the eighth IOrung to earn the 
Victory. 

UCSD put pressure on Sonoma 
State as the Tntons stole 10 ba es 
10 the game . DeSignated hitter 
John Bologna, Merrifield and 
Hawk each stole one base apiece 
while Bunon and Hernandez each 
stole two. Miller led the team With 
three steals in the game. 

Triton Juntor ptrcher Raf 
Bergstrom threw hJS second com-
plete game of the year, allowll1g 
just one run on two hns whIle strik-
ing out four and improving to a 
perfect 4-0 on the season.

seven-mning game and earned hiS 
fifth VictOry of the season, boosong 
hiS record to a perfect 6-0. 
Grubman allowed JUSt two runs on 
eight hits, while striking out four 
Sea wolf batters. 

UCSD scored a single run 10

Tritons play in Rainbow Challenge 
Women's water polo takes 3 out of 6 

National 
anthem gets

By DANIEL DIAl 

Staff Writer 

While the rest of UC D stu-
dents spent their spring break at 
home or in Mexico, the women's 
water polo team traveled to 
Honolulu for a little fun in the 
sun and to compete in the 
Rainbow Challenge, hosted by 
the University of Hawaii on 
March 28 and March 29. The 
Triton ladies returned with the 
obligatory Hawaiian tan and vic-
tories over Cal Baptist, UC Santa 
Cruz and Canada's national team 
in the competition, while falling 
short in losse to Long Beach 
State, Hawaii and Au tralia's 
national team. 

But before the Tritons could 
even take their finals, they played 
host to Indiana, UCLA and 
Princeton at Canyonview Pool 
on March 14 and March 15. 

In the March 14 contest 
against Indiana, UCSD came 
out as electric as lightning; 
striking the Hoosiers with the 
game's first six goals, en route to 
a 9-4 victory. The Tritons 
played fiery ball on both sides of 
the pool; scooping up great 
passes and slippmg defenders on 
one side, while attacking loose 
balls and forci ng bad shots on 
the other. 

"We have had our trouble, 
but today we came out focused 
and played some of the best ball 
of the season," said co-captain 

Dana Tucker. 
The Tritons, however, needed 

the momentum of the victory to 
defeat top-ranked UCLA on 
March IS . UCSD played valiant-
ly during the game, but could 
only manage a lone goal from 
Tucker, as the Tritons suffered an 
11-1 defeat, their worst of the 
season. 

Later under rainy kies, the 
UCSD-Princeton battle was 
decided in the third overtime by 
a shot into the tOp corner of the 
Triton cage that gave the TIgers 

a stunning 6-5 victory. In an 
exciting fourth quarter, the 
Tritons took a 5-4 lead with less 
than a minute to play, only to 
allow the Tiger equalizer on the 
last possession. 

T he Tritons had a slippery 
stan to their tournament on 
March 28 against Cal Baptist, 
falling behind 5-2 before com-
ing back to claim victory over 
the Lancers, 7-6. Meris

E ver since Sept. 11 ,2001, the impact and message of the Star-Spangled Banner ha 
grown to a new level. That day, 
which will live in infamy, as well as 
these current days, has renewed the 
meaning of the poem that became 
America's national anthem. 

It is a tradition that the singing 
of the Star-Spangled Banner pre-
cede the first pitch, jump ball , face-
off, or kickoff of any American 
sporting event, and with each per-
formance of the national anthem, 
spectators are reminded of the 
recent events that Americans have 
had to endure. 

Because the poem is the nation-
al anthem and represents a country 
at the same time, recently, it has 
indirectly given some people the 
opportunity to voice their political 
opinion at sporting events (not that 
the sporting world has much 
importance with the other happen-
ing around the world right now). 

Before her games, Toni Smith, a 
Division III women's college hoops 
player for Manhattanville, turns
