BELFAST, Northern Ireland -
A.showdown is shaping up within 
the dominant Protestant political 
party that could lead to the oust-
ing of its longtime leader, David 
Trimble, and an end to the power-
sharing government at the heart of 
Northern Ireland's peace accord. 

The failure of the IRA to begin 
disarming remains a principal 
complaint of disaffected members 
of the party, the Ulster ' Unionists, 
and a dispute over the new police 
force has now assumed equal 
sticking-point status.

Transfer 
Students Ask 
for Funding 
All-Campus Transfer 
Association request 
money to finance events 
By EDWU 
Contributing News Writer 

Laura Biery and Keri Savage of the newly 
created All-Campus Transfer Association 
went before the A.S. Council Wednesday 
requesting emergency financial funding for 
activities supporting UCSD transfer stu-
dents. 

A.S. Vice President Internal Jeff Dodge 
introduced legislation later in the meeting 
facilitating this request, which will be decid-
ed on at the Wednesday A.S. Council meet-
ing.

IIIapIIDa: The Wagner; celebrated the naming of the MoUi and Arthur Wagner Darwfacility. Twenty six)ltdrS ago, 
Arthur Wagner gave reasons why he thought UCSD rouJd rwt have a theater/dance MFA program. 

Biery, Muir transfer student advocate, 
and Savage, Transfer Student Organization 
chair for Roosevelt , were instrumental in 
creating the All-Campus Transfer 
Association. It was instituted two weeks ago 
to address the lack of activities and support 
for transfer students at Marshall , Warren 
and Revelle, due to the graduation of each of 
those college's transfer student support 
coordinators. Dance Facility Named Although the newly created organization 
registered with Student Organization and 
Leadership Opportunities last week, it is still 
ineligible to receive funding from the A.S. 
Council until winter quarter. 

Molli and Arthur Wagner Dance Facility will house 
MFA program once deemed improbable 
By .BECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

What was formally known as just uThe 
Dance Facility" was renamed The Molli and 
Arthur Wagner Dance Facility in an official 
dedication ceremony last Thursday. 

Arthur Wagner and his wife Molli have a 
history of involvement with UCSD. Arthur was 
the founding chairman of the Department of 
Theater and Dance 27 years ago and has con-
tinued to support ¢ e department and the con-
stru~tion of the n w dance facility. . 

During the ceremony Chancellor Dynes 
honored the Wagners and their commitment to 
the university. He read a memo written by 

Wagner dated from 1974 giving reasons why a 
theater Master of Fine Arts program at UCSD 
was "hard to justify." Ironically, today UCSD 
boasts the third best program in the nation, and 
the best program west of the Hudson River. 

, The MFA program in theater offers 'degrees in 
ll:cting, design, directing, play writing and stage 
management 

According to Walt Jones, chairman of the 
Theater and Dance Department, UCSD annu-
ally produces more plays than most regional 
theaters, giving as many as 30 performances a 
year. 

Arthur Wagner studied dance', theater and

However, since only Muir and Roosevelt 
currently provide funding for transfer stu-
dent activities, the new association quickly 
found itself in a bind. 

UWe held an event at Rock Bottom dur-
ing Welcome Week and drew 75 people," 
Biery said. uWe found that even though the . 
events were advertised for one college, stu-
dents from all five colleges showed up. But 
we cannot suppOrt activities for all five col-
leges with only the funding from ERC and 
Muir."

.Program Receives Grant to Study Assault 
UCSD's Student Safety and Awareness will look at men's role in sex crime prevention 
By MAII8AIID O'NIIU. 
Contributing News Writer 

UCSD's Student Safety and 
Awareness Program has been 
awarded one of nine Federal 
Depanment of Education grants 

_that were given this year for , ~he 
study of the effects of alcohol and 
violence awareness programs on 
college campuses. 

The 28-month, $188,000 grant 
began Oct. 1 and will be in effect 
through December of 2002, The 
specific purpose of the grant is to 
study wa)'$ to include men in the 
process of preventing sexual 
assault, 

"Most men say, ' I would never 
rape somebody, I would never vio-

late somebody, but what can I do 
to help?:" said SSAP Director 
Nancy Wahlig. "There are often 
assumptions that airmen are 
aggressive; that men wouldn't stop 
a rape. We know that's not true, 
but it's never been studied in an 
effective way." 

A licensed social worker, 
Wahlig works with police and 
campus officials to provide sup-
pon for victims of crimes. 

Of the nine federal grants 
awarded, UCSD's is the only one 
aimed at the study of violence. • 

"It's pretty exciting," said 
Shannon Chamberlin, SSAP's 
outreach coordinator. UEveryone's 
looking to us to see what hap-
pens." 

The grant was awarded to fund 
three main strategies of educating 
men on the topic of rape preven-
tion. 

The first strategy is to execute 
male-only workshops. Jerry Phelps 
of UCSD Psychological and 
Counseling Services will be devel-
oping the workshop and training 
other men to 'lead it. 

"I think it's an important pan 
of a larger strategy of the preven-
tion of sexual assault and other 
violence," he said. "Our goal is for 
this to be a positive approach to 
empowering men, including such 
things as improving communica-
tion and intimacy skills." 

Marshall junior Caitlin 
Halferty, who coordinates pro-

grams for SSAP, feels that includ-
ing male instructors will increase 
the effectiveness of the workshops. 

"In a lot of the programs I do, 
men will have a lot of questions 
and concerns," Halferty said . "It 
will be really gt;eat to have an envi-
ronment where they feel comfort-
able asking these questions. It has 
been difficult because I can sense 
they feel defensive because it is a 
female giving the informatio:1 and 
they may feel blamed." 

Students will participate in the 
workshops through student orga-
nizations and residential locations. 
Student organization leaders and 
residential advisors will be able to

funding it was unable to support the 
event financially. 

The organization aims 10 rebuild 
the currently defunct transfer student 
organizations at Warren and Marshall 
as part of an overall goal of supporting 
and acting as advocates for transfer 
student needs. 

"To succeed in college, you need 
both social and academic support. We 
are trying to fulfill that: Savage said. 

Biery pointed out that transfer stu-
dents' needs are significantly different 
from those of freshmen and continu-
ing UCSD students. 

"1ransfer students get no overnight 
orientation like the freshmen: she 
said. "In addition, almost as soon as 
transfer students arrive, they have to 
consider things like the GRE, graduate 
school or jobs, since they only spend 
two years at UCSD." 

In spite of these special needs, the 
current resources available to transfer 
students are considered by Biery and 
Savage to be woefully inadequate.

SSAP has also studied

sign up their groups for the work-
shop. 

The second program to be used is 
a "social norms marketing campaign." 
It involves surveying a sample of the 
campus population to find out what 
actually happens in contrast to the 
"social norm" assumptions about 
aspects of sexual assault. 

In conjunction with Student 
Health, SSAP was awarded this same 
grant three years ago for the study of 
alcohol consumption on campus. The 
results of that survey were published 
on posters that now appear around 
campus. 

"It's critical that we make this per-
fect at UCSD: Wahlig said. "The 
whole point is to make it relevant to 
our students so that it meets their 
needs. Then maybe it can be used at 
other universities, both in California 
and nationwide." 

The third strategy the grant is 
funding is a computer program called 
"Campus Factoids." The program will 
be piloted next fall at Muir college. 

The program, developed by David 
Craig and Wes Perkins of Hobart and 
Smith College in New York, is a type 
of interactive electronic bulletin 
board for students to access and 
respond to facts regarding sexual 
assault and violence. Students will 
have the opportunity to discuss with 
other students the sensitive topic of 
rape. 

The plan is to make it available at 
computer labs and residential halls so 
that first-year students can access it on 
their computers. 

"We've seen it and it really is excit-
ing. It creates a discussion that people 
really wouldn't have otherwise," 
Wahlig said. 

Brian Murray, UCSD's assistant 
vice chancellor for student develop-
ment, is the principal investigator for 
the grant. Professional evaluators 
began working with SSAP when the 
grant was awarded, developing surveys 
and evaluating methods for all three 
strategies. 

Wahlig is excited about the grant 
because she has been working with 
the topic of sexual assault and wants 
to develop this area. The goal of the 
program IS to determine what combi-
nation of strategies is most effective. 

"I think there are a lot of men who 
want}o help, but they j~st dO.n't know 
how, Chamberhn said. The Idea with 
this grant is to empower men and give 
them a role in rape prevention."

Gordon claimed the market was experiencing 
an upswing that would last for another eight to 
10 years. He also said he was seeing more and 
more signs of "job switch remorse: with 40 per· 
cent of people joining dot-<:om companies return-
ing to their employers. 

In addition, Miller cited several characteristics 
of "great" companies that are able to adapt to 
teday's marketplace. They include hiring people 
for their skills, not their experience; offering work 
balance as opposed to asking employees to work 
70 to 80 hours; mentoring employees Instead of 
managing them; encouraging people to take risks 
and make mistakes in order to create new ser· 
vices and products, and offering "fun time."

Transfer: 
Chancellor Dynes is 
sympathetic to their case . 

"(n-ansfer students) are thrown 
into a pool of water and it is easy to 
drown," Savage said. "Transfer stu-
dents are regular students with a 
ton of questions and no one to 
answer them." 

A spring. 1999 report by 
UCSD's Task Force to Consider 
Transfer Student Issues stated, "It 
is clear that during the initial peri-
od at UCSD, transfer students suf-
fer from not knowing where to find 
the various kinds of information, 
advice, help and counseling that is 
needed." 

The task force, which included 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph Watson, recommended the 
creation of a small center for 
transfer students. Although such a 
center has yet to be created, 
UCSD seems to be supportive of 
bids to support transfers more 
adequately. 

Biery said that Watson and 
Chancellor Robert Dynes.were very 
supportive of their cause, but 
"although (the] administration is 
very aware of th,is problem, they are 
not quite sure what to do." 

The new organization and the 
1999 task force agree that the 
problem has riscn out of UCSD's 
success in recruiting transfer stu-
dents from community colleges. 

In 1989, the 582 new transfer 
students represented 4 percent of 
the 14,324 undergraduates at 
UCSD. In 2000, 1,252 new trans-
fers represent 7.6 percent of. the 
16,498 undergraduates on cam-
pus. In the past two years alone, 
transfer applicants have risen 
from 4,654 in 1998 to 6,349 for 
fall 2000. 

The new organization states 
that the unofficial count of trans-
fers who attend UCSD is 3,339, 
making them comprise roughly 20 
percent of the school's undergrad-
uate population. 

"They are doing an awesome 
job getting students onto our 
campus," Sava$e said. "The num-
ber of applications has gone from 
2,000 to 4,000 to almost 6,000. 
(The number of applications is) 
growing exponentially, but so 
many people don't know what to 
do with them."

These chalkings and flyers 
attacking SU's homosexual com-

Coming Out Week, a solidarity

Several SU students and adminis-

Pride Union members said they

and left to do more work else-

PINION 
A DECISIVE 
POI N T 

A needle exchange program in San Diego would help halt the spread 
of diseases and eventually the use of drugs . 
By DlVYA HUNCRAL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Today the San Diego City Council will have 
the opportunity 10 embrace a potentially life-
changing referendum. It will vote on the Harm 
Reduction Program, a program that allows drug 
uSj:rs to exchange their contaminated needles for 
new ones. 

Although the program's costs - $200,000 to 
$300,000 a year - are rela-
tively trivial in comparision to 

published literature, scripture and preaching. 
Many are con.vmced that ~educing the availability 
of needles Will deter "crlmmals" from harming 
themselves and others . . 

This reasoning is faulty because drug users, 
desperate for a high, often lack the ability to 
restram themselves from using heroin or other 
drugs just because the needle they have has been 
used before. It i~ un~erstandable that many peo-
ple feel exchangmg dirty needles for clean ones is 

dangerous because there are 
no potential consequences 

the budget of the city, it is 
uncertain whether critics will 
be assuaged by the program's 
platform, which includes 
medical services and drug 
treatment programs. 

In fact, the proposed Harm 
Reduction Program will cost 
the city little, if anythin~ at all . 

P.I~ that deter users, new or old, from getting their next liigh . However, we are irrespon-sible if we fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the addicts' disease. Their inability to comprehend the stark mes-
sage in the media and in the 

The p.rog~m, as prescribed by 
a ~ahfomla law passed earlier this year, will be 
prIVately funded by the Alliance Health 
Foundation. With an endowment of over $100 
million, this foundation is well prepared to take 
up any cost overflow. 

Although critics deride the implementation of 
needle exchange programs as a contributor to 
drug use, it is in the best interest of the commu-
nity to safeguard drug users and other citizens 

~om the ris~ of acquiring HIV and other poten-
tially fatal dIseases. It is not an intelligent choice 
to turn .one's b.ack to the reality that many drug 
users Will continue to abuse drugs regardless of

gers associated with drug use, 

reveals. how ~ard it is to wean drug users fro.m a 
world In which they can escape emotional and 
physical suffering. . 

Many people feel that drug users are evil or 
deserve the ~egredation of living both a physical-
ly and emotionally unhealthy existence. In their 
eyes, drug users are disposable and therefore do 

n~>t need the taxpayer to protect them from lethal 
diseases. There are many consequences to this 
ideology that uldmatdy hurt taxpayers.

Though it does have ~ts merits, the Harm Reduction Program will 
not help solve the matn problem: the abuse of drugs in San Diego,

Senior Staff Writer 

. .Needle ~xchange programs provide clean 
syrlnge.s t~ Intravenous drug users in exchange 
for .thetr ~I~, used needles. NEPs are in place in 
major clttes around the country such as 

et.evel~nd, San Fra~ci~co and Chicago. Today San 
Diego s City counctl Will vote on whether to initi-
ate such a program. 

NEPs help stop the spread 
• of blood-borne infectious dis-

part for the supposed recipients of an NEP. As the . 
stateme~t dem<?":s~tes, Wear's thoughts lie with 
the .~II'~USlbdlty of the program and its cul-
pability to hiS voters, not its actual effect on intra-
venous. drug ~ who, by the way, also happen 
to be hiS constituents and part of his ~public" 

Until today, when the issue will be voted on 
the San Die.go ne~dle exchange program was only 
under conslderatton. It .was proposed earlier this 
year when California passed a law stating that if a 

medical state of emergency is 
declared at the city level, the 

eases such as HrY and hepati-
tis C among intravenous users. 
However, NEPs act as no more 
than a Band-Aid on a blight In 
society. Exchanging needles 
for intravenous drug users 
does nothing to curb IV drug 
use afld only inadvertently 
helps drug users. 

con 
city can implement an NEP. 
The city, however, will have to 
bear the brunt of the cost. 

Accordtng to Professor Ian 
1l'owbridge, a researcher at the 
Salk Institue, if the motion 
passes, San Diego's program 
wtll ~ funded by a private GUARDIAN OP1NION 

The emphasis of a needle 
exchange program is not on helping the people 
who are addicted, but instead on hindering them 
from spreading disease. 

Byron Wear, a San Diego city councilman who 
~eads the committee on needle exchange, believes 
m ~ needle exchange program in San Diego. 

P~b~l~ sa!ety has always been one of my high-
est prtontles, he stated. "Hepatitis C poses a seri-
ous threat to our public health .. . I believe a I'ri-
vately funded program offering these services to 
the city of San Diego makes good fiscal sense." 

Not once in his statement does Wear refer to 
.t~e people that a~ exchange program might 
directly help; there IS no show of concern on his 

organtzatlon called Alliance 
Health Foundation. The cost is 

estimated -to be $200,000 to $300,000 a year. The 
taxpaye.rs will bear ITO responsibility for the NEp, 
which In San Diego's market of conservatism is 
always the easiest way to get something to pass. 

Even the words used to describe the EP are 
loaded in favor of the populace at large and not 
the drug user: "harm reduction: "medical state of 
emergency." To whom .are the authors of the pro-
posal. aPJ'Cahng b~ uSing terms like these? The 
wor~lng IS an obVIOUS ploy making use of com-
passion a~d anempting to perpetrate hysteria.

Wearing the Mask of Tolerance Overzealous Christians 
are too Dominant Even though it is well hidden, racism is still alive and kicking 
Some Christian groups are too pushy in 
their zeal to spread their religion to others 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

Much has been said about the 
"tolerant" society we live in. 
However, if we take a closer look 
beneath the surface, we find that 
hate still thrives and divides. 

As I was growing up, I observed 
the people in my life conforming to 
our nation's so-called "tolerant 
society." Yet appearances are not 
always what they seem. lime and 
time again I witnessed people put 
on the mask of tolerance, one that 
only gives the appearance of toler-
ance of another's race or beliefs. 
But when the African American, 
Latino or Jewish person is no 
longer in the person's presence, the 
mask of tolerance vanishes and the 
person's face contorts with anger 
and 'hate. . 

These racists spit out hateful 
comments such as, "Soon the 
Hispanics will run California." Or 
they'll laugh and call all blacks 
apes. They call Hitler a great man 
and blindly reject as a lie the fact 
that millions of Jews were killed in 
the Holocaust. . 

Who are these people? They 
aren't horrible monsters from 
which children run in fear. These 
people do not belong to organized 
hate groups such as the Aryan 
Nation or the Ku KluxJ<lan. 

Racist people can be found as 
everyday contractors, managers, 
lawyers. secretaries, bankers. home-

school parents, stock brokers and 
small-business owners. The scary 
thing is that these: feelings of big-
otry and hate are masked within 
ordinary people, someone who may 
live next door and attend the same . 
religious center or school as you 
do. 

These people don the mask of 
civility and tolerance to avoid being 
shunned by society as a bigot. 
Tragically, these adults' hateful 
comments and actions ingrain in 
their children the notion that it is 
all right to hate people for having a 

[ know from personal 
experience that simply 
being tolerant of others' 
differences cannot destroy 
the underlying hatred 
that fills so many 
Americans today, 
different skin color or beliefs, and 
so the cycle of hate continues. 

The only way I see to stop this 
destructive cycle is through educa-
tion and with the interaction of 
people of different cultural back-
grounds. That is what saved me 
from becoming the hateful bigot I 
was taught by my family to be. 

I broke free from a world of hate 
with my own beliefs intact. My first 
day at UCSD was the happiest day 
of my life, for I was finally free of 
the terrifying, hate-filled environ-
ment I was born into. At UCSD, I 
was able to express what I believe 
without fear of repercussions. 

I know from personal experi-
ence that simply being tolerant of 
others' differences cannot destroy 
the underlying hatred that fills so 
many Americans today. Racism is 
still going strong because tolerance 
is not a strong-enough antidote to 
reverse the institutionalized raciSm 
that divides our nation. 

But what is the definition of to 1-
erance, our nation's most touted 
phrase? According to "Webster's 
College Dictionary; to be tolerant 
is to be "inclined or disposed to tol-
erate." 'The definition of tolerate is 
as follows: "to allow the existence, 
presence, practice or to endure 
without repuFnce; put up with." 

So if I'm In the presence of an 
African American or Jewish person 
and I follow the definition of toler-
ance. society doesn't require me to 
stop hating him, but just to "put up 
with" him while in his presence. 

Is this the message of tolerance 
our president and civil rights lead-
ers are advocating, one that allows 
hate and prejudice to continue? 

This approach only 'serves to 
reinforce the idea that it is accept-
able to wear the mask of tolerance, 
because it is politically correct to be 
tolerant. It is no wonder that we 
cannot completely stamp out hate 
when this is the message we are 
sending: Just tolerate people and 
their differences, and when they are 
not around, go ahead and continue 
to relish in your hatred! 

What I do not understand is 
why we, as a society, are not advo-
cating acceptance of one another's 
differences, as the means to end

Senior Sf aff Writer 

My fourth year as a UCSD 
student has started, and as 
expected, several religious cults 
or fanatics have relentlessly 
solicited me. In particular, 
Christians have welcomed me 
into their lives of God and broth-
erhood. I have been invited to 
Bible study. I soon expect to see 
campaigns for Christianity, such 
as a Campus Crusade. I expect to 
see several Asian guitar players 
playing a tune in the name of 
God and their happiness. 

At each occurrence of these 
events, I have and I know I will 
reject every one of their Christian 
invitations. I do not hate the 
cause. I just cannot stand the 
sheer dominance of Protestant 
Christian faith in our campus 
community. 

I know that the insisting efforts 
of these Protestant groups does 
not reflect the views of the entire 
Christian population; however, the 
mere audacity of their goals 
stereotypes the group as cults. 

During my first year, I was 
naive and did not expect to be 
constantly bombarded by 
Christians. I knew these cults 
existed, but now I know how will-
ing they are to insist their faith 
upon a stranger. My third year 
solidified my vantage point of 
Christian dominance, after wit-
nessing the pervading effects of 
~Do you agree with Michael?" and 
the many Harvest prayer gather-

ings in public outdoor senings. 
Several friends of mine th ink 

that by simply walking down 
Library Walk they will be con-
fronted by a Christian fanatic that 
falsely befriends them in order to 
lure them into their crusade. The 
false premise given by the 
Christian fanatics hinders their 
crusade even if they are truly sin-
cere about their cause. The auda-
cious invitations the Christians 
make is analogous to a fraternity 
brother annoying a victim to 
pledge. Perhaps, some individuals 
are pleased by their conspicuous 
goals. But, I am not. 

I must admit - it seems like 
Christian Protestants are domi-
nant in our multiracial and diverse 
campus. However, even though we 
take so much pride that UCSD is a 
diverse community, I plainly see 
that religious diversity is not dear-
ly evident. As yet another analogy, 
I think Christians are even more 
dominant than the general white 
population here at UCSD. In my 
eyes, I see the religious majority as 
a bunch of BYU students, with a 
large Asian following. 

I must give credit to these 
organizations of Chris tians. 
These groups are mobilized and 
have the capability of organizing 
huge events. They have a cause 
and are reaching out for us to be 
like them. They want us to join 
them. They even have a diverse 
racial background, and they are 
generally successful in extending

6 OPINION 

Pro: 
Program is the first step to 
rehabilitate drug abusers 
ContI ...... froM ..... 4 
fatal diseases is beneficial to every-
one. The risk of contracting AIDS 
is a serious possibility when one 
considers that drug users often do 
not have the resources to get clean 
needles. They may end up sharing 
needles already contaminated with 
someone else's blood. 

This behavior eventually causes 
a ripple effect. It no longer" affects 
one or two people but an entire 
community. Through sexual con-
tact, disease can be spread to 
unwitting participants who can, in 
turn, transmit the disease to oth-
ers. 

In the end, we have a snowball 
effect that eventually hurts us in 
the pocket. Many people cannot 
afford the cost of drug treatment 
for HIV, hepatitis C and other 
blood-borne diseases, eventually 
straining the budgets of clinics and 
the city itself. 

It is up to us to make the deci-
sion to prevent the transmission of 
diseases that destroy families and 

• severely impact each individual 
afflicted by them. It is our ethical 
and civic responsibility to protect 

citizen~, however denigrated they 
are by society and the media. 

Many of us have friends or even 
relatives who have addictions to 
drugs that are so strong that with-
drawl is often a dangerous and 
extreme ley painful process. Taking 
drugs away from drug users will 
not prevent them from finding 
other means of getting drugs. 

Why do opponents to the Harm 
Reduction Progam think denying 
drug users clean needles will pre-
vent them from acquiring contam-
inated ones from peers or in trash 
containers? It is illogical to think 
the city is helping drug users by 

denying them access to clean nee-
dles. 

Although some citizens may 
balk at the cost of implementing 
such programs, believing them a 
waste of money, treating patients 
down the line who have AIDS and 
other diseases is not cheap. 
According to professor Ian 
Trowbridge, a researcher at the 
Salk Institute and an advocate of 
San Diego's needle exchange pro-
gram, the cost of caring for an 
AIDS patient until his death can be 
up to $150,000. This is nearly the 
entire annual cost of the San Diego 
needle exchange program. 

It is hard for many people to 
acknowledge that drug abusers 
deserve our support. This writer 
also felt, at one time, that allowing 
drug users access to fresh needles 
was encouraging the spread of 
drugs. However, my opinion 
changed once I realized the drug 
war is still raging in the United 
States, even though the govern-
ment has spent millions, if not bil-
lions, trying to reform the "out-
casts" of society. 

AIDS is a serious reality in 
today's world . Although much 
attention has been paid to this dis-
ease, its debilitating effects are 
often not publicized. It is a horren-
dous disease that even the most evil 
person in the world does not 
deserve to endure. All of us have 
the moral responsibility to help 
stem the risk of acquring AIDS and 
other diseases. 

Perhaps this program is not the 
sole answer to our society's drug 
abuse problem. However, this may 
be the first step in solving it. By 
working.in conjuction with other 
drug programs San Diego already 
has in place, the spread of diseases 
and drugs can be stemmed consid-
erably. It is integral that support is 
given to the Harm Reduction 
Program and those with drug 
problems - and ultimately our-
selves as well. ' 

The UCSD Guardian 

Con: 
Program does not address 
the main issue 
........... froIII ..... 
that people can feel good about 
implementing the program. Who 
does not want to reduce the 
amount of "harm" around? The 
public feels good about the pro-
gram. It makes them feel like pro-
ductive citizens. These words are 
an easy way to cover up the real 
problem: the abuse of intravenous 
drugs. 

In his article, Wear makes one 
indirect comment about intra-
venous drug users: "... syringes 
found in public places [provide) a 
bridge to drug treatment." Wear 
attempts to state that the needle 
programs help push users into 
treatment. 

This may be true, but nowhere 
does Wear say how the two pro-
grams are to be integrated, nor 
outline any kind of plan . He 
merely adds that an NEP "is 
worth trying in light of the public 
benefit: 

Stephanie Casenza, a spokes-
woman for the foundation that is 
funding the NEP said, "The pro-
grams provide good bridges for 
treatment. For many people it is 
their one contact with anyone 
who knows anything about 
health." 

True, this is a positive note. 
Bridging the treatment and 
exchange programs would make 
the NEP an excellent program. 
But wait - there is no proposal 
for bridging the programs. The 
closest Casenza gets to proposing 
an actual program is when she 
states, "The exchanges would be 
tied to some sort of treatment or 
counseling for drug users." 

That is nice. Nice and vague, 
that is. The NEP will be tied to 
some program "to be named 

later." In my experience, anything 
"to be named later" amounts to 
zilch. 

In 1993, UC Berkeley and UC 
San Francisco published a study 
commissioned by the federal gov-
emtnent. It recommended needle 
exchange programs as a way to 
decrease HIV infection rates and 
those of other blood-borne dis-
eases among intravenous drug 
users. 

However, when it came to inte-
grating NEPs with treatment pro-
grams, the study stated, "Some 
programs have made significant

numbers of referrals to drug 
abuse treatment ... but referrals 
are limited by the paucity of drug 
treatment slots. Integrating NEPs 
into the existing public health sys-
tem is a likely future direction for 
these programs." 

The study reinforces the fact 
that the NEPs only attempt to 
stop the spread of disease but do 
little to stop drug use - the main 
problem. 

Wear and Casenza's quotes 
exemplify an NEP's ability to 
soothe the collective conscience 

. but do not suggest that it can do 
much else. An NEP allows people 
to ease their worried minds while 
doing nothing to eliminate the 
problem that is there in the first 
place. 

It looks like a win-win situa-
tion to some: Provide a helping

drug users, and help out the pub-
lic by slowing or stopping the 
spread of HIV and hepatitis C. In 
reality, an NEP helps no one but 
the drug abusers. There is no real 
helping hand extended, only the 
visage of one. 

The program effectively states. 
"Here is a dean needle - shoot up 
all you want, just do not spread 
HIV or leave dirty needles around 
where others could be pricked by 
them. Kill yourself overdosing, or 
starve to death because you spend 
all your money on drugs, but just 
don't let that HIV near me and 
mine." 

In a study of 415 intravenous 
users in Philadelphia conducted 
over four years, 28 of the users 
died: five from HIV related caus-
es, and 23 from other drug-relat-
ed causes. It was concluded that 
other causes presented a "more 
imminent" threat to death than 
HIY. Yet, NEPs s~ek not to help 
in these other causes of death, 
but actually allow them to con-
tinue, while at the same time only · 
eliminating the spread of H1V 
infection through intravenous 
drug use. 

An NEP relegates drug users 
to their lot. It does not try to pull 
them out of it, but instead locks 
them in. even if just as a by-
product of good intentions. 
NEPs turn drug users into the 
lepers of the 21st century. If they 
were paired with treatment pro-
grams, NEPs might be seen in a 
different light. However, only 
pairing them with existing pro-
grams will not be enough, as 
shown by the study of UCB and 
UCSF. 

There must be an investment 
of federal, state or private money 
that integrates both treatment 
and exchange. As it stands now, 
NEPs only provide a pseudo-
moralistic tourniquet for a 

'wound that will continue to 
bleed.

Editor: 
Enough is enough. 
When the violence started in 

Israel two weeks ago, I blamed 
Ariel Sharon. "He should be 
hanged", I said. I understood the 
anger of the Palestinians. 

.In th~ past week, the Israeli 
police have not sought out the 
Palestinians. The Palestinians 
have gone to Israeli police 
bunkers, picking fights, throwing 
firebombs during the day and 
shooting live ammunition at 
night. An American college stu-
dent was almost killed on the 
street in Israel last week because 
he was jewish. He' made no 
provocation, and he was nowhere 
near the fighting. 

Last week, jews were engaged 
in Sabbath prayers at the Wailing 
Wall when Palestinians threw 
rocks and large chunks of concrete 
at them from above. When the 
Israeli police evacuated Joseph's 
tomb, in an effort to remove con-
flict from that area, they entrusted 
Palestinian police with protecting 
the area. A hundred Palestinian 
thugs stormed the tomb and 
destroyed jewish prayer books and

Letter: 
Reporter did not try hard 
enough to get info 
._ ......... ,..., 
Campus Security Act. also referred 
to as the Clery Act. 

In fact. if you had abided by the 
standard of "truth" you cite in your 
Oct. 11 opinion piece, you would 
have informed the readers that the 
Clery Act only requires the collec-
tion and reporting of ·crimes." 

In the Oct. 9 article, you report 
that I was not available to confirm 
the assurana: given by Sergeant 
Jones that sex crimes would no 
longer be repprted unde~ the 
generic heading of abuse. An tnte~­
tiona I omission of an essential 
piece of information is not ~th­
telling. In this instance. you faIled 
to mention that the reporter called 
me after business hours on Friday, 
Oct. 6. 2000, and he left no mes-
sage on the phone message record-
ing system. The reporter also made 
no cft'ort to contact me at my home 
phone. unlike other Guardian 
reporters on .prior occasions. It 
would have taken minimal effort to 
dial 411 to obtain my home num-
ber. If your reporter had made t~t 
minimal effort I would have proVId-
ed him not only with the assurance 
he was seeking. but also with more 
complete and accurate informa-
tion, including but not limited to 
the fact that UCSD voluntarily 
includes noncriminal incidents of 
student misconduct involving 
"physical abuse" of all types. 

But the most glaring misrepre-
sentation in the Oct. 9 article and 
in the Oct. 11 opinion piece is that 
the number of reported crimes at 
UCSD is caused by inadequate 
collection and reporting by UCSD 
police officials and campus securi-
ty authorities of sex crimes and 
crimes of violence occurring at 
lJCSD. The truth is. the low num-
bers of these two types of crimes as 
contained in the UCSD Campus 
Crime Report is caused by the 
refusal of victims to report inci-
dents of possible crime or to coop-
erate with police officers or cam-
pus security authorities in the 
investigation of the incident. 

I am in complete agreement 
with the concluding remark in the 
Oct. 11 opinion stating, "Safety 
and truth matter to us." With 
respect to our concern for "safety." 
UCSD has been a leader in provid-
ing program~ that promo~e iI. safe 
and supportive campus envIron-
ment for the campus community 
in general and for students in par-
ticular. 

In addition to the security 
escorts you mention in the Oct. 11 
opinion piece, UCSD has pio-
neered student safety and victim 
support initiatives such as the 
Student Safety and Awareness 
Program, Psychological and 
Counseling Services. emergency 
call boxes located throughout 
campus and the annual "Take Back 
the ight" program. All deans of 
students and residence hall deans 
are in direct contact with students 
on a daily basis, and they take spe-
cial care to assist any student who 
has been identified as a victim of 
violence and to ensure that the 
stuqent is provided appropriate 
follow-up care, counseling and 
support. They also make it a point 
to immediately report such inci-
dents to the campus police depart-
ment for investigation and prose-
cution if warranted by the facts 
made known to the investigating 
officer. 

I regret that you failed to contact 
me prior to the print deadlines for 
these pieces. Should you need to 
contact me in the future after busi-
ness hours, please feel free to con-
tact me at my home number, which 
I will provide upon request, or 
which can be obtained by dialiilg

.......... D & NATION 
A Lull In Arab-I ..... I Violence Ailead of 
Summit, but Tensions Remain High 

JERUSALEM - Although 
there were few actual clashes 
Sunday, Israelis braced for 
Palestinian terror anacks, 
Palestinians were alarmed by 
Israeli warnings of fierce reprisals 
against any more mob violence. 
and neither side could muster 
much hope that Monday's sum-
mit meeting in Egypt could' yield 
more than a shaky truce. 

.. Barak and Arafat are just 
going there to sign a piece of 
paper, and that is all." said 
Ghassan Abdeen, a Palestinian 
merchant. as he commiserated 
with a Jewish friend, Sara 
HeckeIman, in his otherwise 
empty- Jerusalem souvenir shop. 
"But if they don't sign something. 
the whole region will be at war." 

Heckelman dispiritedly agreed. 
"This has got to stop: she said. 
As they spoke, the Israeli mili-

tary was digging trenches and 
installing barricades across once-
heavily traveled checkpoints 
between Israel and areas under 
Palestinian Authority control. 

With few exceptions, Palestinians 
were refused permission to enter 
Israel, while most Israelis who 
wished to enter Palestinian areas 
were turned back by Israeli securi-

ty. "To get into the Palestinian 
side from the Israeli side is diffi-

The appointment caused 
such uproar among the 
opposition leaders 
themselves that it was

cult, but possible: said Anton 
Mourah, a clerk at a Bethlehem 
hotel near a newly reinforced 
Israeli checkpoint. "To get into the 
Israeli side from the Palestinian 
side is a miracle." 

Throughout Israel, police were 
placed on high alert Sunday in 
anticipation of possible terrorist 
attacks, a warning Israeli officials 

said was prompted by the release 
from Palestinian jails in the past 
two weeks of scores of imrrisoned 
members of the radica funda-
mentalist Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad movements. 

Reports of the abduction in 
Europe by Hezbollah guerrillas of 
an Israeli reserve officer further 
heightened tension. 

In West Jerusalem, normally 
bustling during the first days of 
his Sukkot holiday week, malls 

and shopping districts were near-
ly deserted Sunday, and often-
perfunctory security checks at 
movie theaters and department 
stories were carried out with 
deadly seriousness. 

But by late evening there. ha.d 
been no reports of any terror inCI-
dents, and clashes between Israeli 
forces and Palestinian protesters 
were limited to brief exchanges of 
stones and rubber-coated steel 
bullets, with no critical injuries.

Chevron Corp. Agrees to Acquire 
Texaco Inc. for $36 Billion 

The 'Chevron Corp. agreed on 
Sunday to acquire Texaco Inc. 
for about $36 billion , creating 
the world's fourth-largest oil 
concern. 

The compantes boards 
approved the deal, which is 
expected to be announced on 
Monday, executives close to the 
transaction said . It comes during 
a period of high oil and gas 
prices. and much political 
jostling both in the United 
States and abroad to keep those 
prices in check. 

The acquisition will most like-
ly come under intense scrutiny by 
regulators, who could force the 
combined company to divest cer-
tain assets, especially in states like 
California where the company 
would dominate the retail gas sta-
tion business. 

At the same time, oil compa-
nies like Chevron and Texaco 
face enormous pressure to merge 
to remain competitive with the 
new breed of oil giants like 
Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco and 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the 
three largest oil companies in the 
world. While the combined com-
pany would operate nearly 

50,000 gas stations worldwide, it 
would still be less than half the 
size of Exxon Mobil based on 
annual revenue. 

The proposed giant, to be 
ca lled Chevron Texaco, would 
bring together two of the nation 's 
most storied companies, combin-
in~ the former Standard Oil 
Company of California, now 

It comes during a period 
of high oil and gas prices 
and much political 
jostling both in the 
United States and 
abroad to keep those 
prices in check 
known as Chevron, with Texaco, 
which was founded in 1902 by 
"Buckskin Joe" Cullinan and 
whose advertising tagline. "You 
can trust your car to the man who 
wears the star: became part of the 
country's consciousness in the 
194Os. 

The boards of both Chevron, 
based in San Francisco, and 

Texaco, based in White Plains, 
N.Y., met on Sunday afternoon 
and approved the deal after nego-
tiations that began in the spring, 
according to senior executives 
involved in the talks. 

According to the executives. 
Chevron will swap 0.77 share -
the equivalent of $64.87 based on 
Friday's closing price - for every 
share of Texaco. That represents a 
premium of about 18 percent over 
the $55.13 that Texaco's stock 
closed at on Friday. Chevron will 
also assume about $7 billion of 
Texaco's debt. 

The new company will be 
based in San Francisco, the exec-
utives said . It is unclear how 
deep job cuts will be at Texaco's 
headquarters, but the combined 
company plans to eliminate 
4,000 positions, mostly from 
overlapping management and 
back-office operations. to save 
$1 .2 billion a year, the executives 
said. 

Before job cuts, the combined 
company would employ 57,000 
people. _

Ireland: 
Trimble's support has 
waned in the last year 
ContI ..... from PICe 1 

In the past year, Trimble's sup-
port has been gradually ebbing. 
and now he faces a threat from a 
rival within his party, Jeffrey 
Donaldson. 

An opponent of the 1998 peace 

that has become increasingly palat-
able to the pro-British Protestan ts. 

Trimble's leadership test comes 
on Oct. 28 when the party's 800-
member cou ncil holds an emer-
gency meeting here to discuss its 
options. . 

"Trimble has come out fightmg, 
he's up for this: Bew said. "Even 
though support for the agreement 
is down to 40 percent among 
Protestants, nimble himself is vast-
ly more popular." 

"Donaldson's being 
able to play on the 
fear of electoral 
meltdown has given 
him the legs to make 
a challenge." 

In September 
1999, a pa nel 
chaired by Chris 
Patten, the former 
Hong Kong gover-
nor, proposed tha t 
the police force 
reduce its size, shed 
its politically 
charged emblems 
and recruit more

Donaldson con-
tends that his seat 
and others in 
Parliament are in 
danger of being lost 
unless the 
Unionists withdraw 
from the Northern 
Ireland Assembly, 
the centerpiece of 
the accord.

Irish hIstory at Queens Untverslty. 
Since the home rule legislature was 
structured to function on a 
Catholic-Protestant power-sharing 
mQdel, the departure of the largest 
Protestant party would bring it to 
an end. That in turn would most 
likely lead to a restoration of direct 
rule from London, an outcome

The only time the Senate

ContInued frGnp ~e 1 
Senate campaigns. 

Whichever party ends up in 
control, the prospects are that its 
majority in the Senate will be the 
narrowest in over 40 years. The 
small majority could make the pas-
sage of major legislation in areas 
like Social Security, taxes and 
health care even more problematic. 

It is conceivable, the experts 
agree, that there will be a 50-SO split, 
in which case the next vice president 
could cast the tie-breaking vote 
determining which party runs the 
committees and sets the agenda. 

The only time the Senate has 
been evenly divided was in 1881 and 
1882, and the consequence, wrote 
Richard A. Baker, the Senate histori-
an, was "organizational chaos." 

Sen. Joseph Lieberman has com-
plicated the Democrats' position 
this year by insisting on running for 
re-election in Connecticut, where he 
is almost certain to win , at the same 

. time that he is the Democratic can-
didate for vice president.

Isl and and Slade Gorton of 
Washington. The Democrat is 
Charles Robb of Virginia. 

Going into the election, 
Republicans hold a 54-to-46-seat 
advantage. That means that if the 
Democrats ga in four seats, there 
will be a 50-50 tie when the Senate 
convenes in January. 

But if Vice President.AI Gore is 
elected president and Lieberman 
becomes vice president, he will 
resign from the Senate, and Gov. 
John Rowland, a Republican, will 
doubtless appoint a Republican 
tohold the Connecticut Senate seat 
until the 2002 election. And if 
Lieberman does not become vice 
president and remains in the 
Senate, there will be a Republican 
vice president, Dick Cheney, to cast 
the tie-breaking vote if the Senate 
is evenly divided. 

In either case, D'emocrats would 
have to pick up five seats in the 
elections to have the majority.

lawyerS Call for Refonn of Death Penalty in Texas 
HOUSTON - In a sweeping 

critique of capital punishment in 
Texas, a new report concludes that 
the state's death penalty system is 
in dire need of reform because of 
problems like prosecutorial mis-
conduct, racial bias, phony experts 
and inadequate lawyers for indi-
gent defendants. 

The report was written by the 
Texas Defender Service, a non prof-

. it group that represents death. ~ow 
inmates. It follows another cntlcal 
study, commissioned by a commit-
tee of the State Bar of Texas. that 
described the state's system of pr0-
viding legal representation to the 
poor u "a national embamss-

ment." 
Under Gov. George W. Bush, 

the state leads the nation in execu-
tions. Bush has repeatedly defend-
ed the . state's system as fair and 
unbiased. 

Maurie Levin, a lawyer for the 
Texas Defender Service, said the 
group examined every published 
death penalty decision rendered by 
the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals. the state's highest crimi-
nal court. since 1976. 

·We did this because the 
administration of the death penalty 
in Texas is in crisis." said Levin. 
The report is scheduled to be 
released on Monday. 

The report also alleges 
that 121 Texas inmates 
have been sentences to 
death based on unreliable 
psychiatric testimony. 

The report examined 103 
appeals cases and found that in 79 
percent of them, the judge never 
held an actual hearing but instead 
relied on documents submitted to 
the court. In' addition, lawyers for 
death row inmates often failed to 
conduct searches for new cvi-

dence. The study also concluded 
that proseclltors are far more like-
ly to pursue the death penalty 
when the victim is white as 
opposed to ' black. 

Blacks and Hispanics often are 
likely to be excluded from capital 
juries. The result , the report said, 
is that black Texans are "least like-
ly to serve on capital juries, but 
the most likely to be cond~mned 
to die." 

The report also alleges that 
121 Texas inmates have been sen-
tenced to death based on unreli-
able psychiatric testimony. One 
example cited in the report 
involved Willie Williams and 

Joseph Nichols, two men convict-
ed of a murder in which a deli 
owner was shot to death by a si n-
gle bullet. In the punishment 
phase of Williams ' trial, the pros-
ecutor argued that he was the 
gunman. But in the punishment 
phase of Nichols ' subsequent 
trial, the same prosecutor argued 
that Nichols was the actual gun-
man, the report stated. 

Both men were sentenced to 
death. Williams was executed in 
January 1995, shortly after Bush 
took office. Nichols remains on 
death row.

/ocall!d in the tReater district. The facility was named on 71Iur3day.

architecture in New York at Smith 

~ollege. Earlier, ~e. founded profes-
sional actor trammg programs at 
Tulane. Ohio and Temple univ~rsi­
ties. 

The new Molli and Arthur 
Dance facility was built in January 
1998 and is located just east of the 
Mandell Weiss Forum. The state-,of 
the-art facility was designed by 
award winning and internationally 
recognized architect Antoine 
Predock. It has three naturally lit 
and temperature-controlled stu-
dios with superior acoustics and 
spacious shower and locker rooms ... 
Wagner said people will come from 
far and wide to perform in the 
beautiful facility. 

"The good surroundings 
enhance the creativity; Wagner 
said. "The floors and sense of space 

give back to the studios.· 
Before the facility was built, stu-

dents had to practice in the main 
gym. Georgios Anagnostopoulos. 
interim dean of Arts and 
Humanities, said the construction 
of the Molli and Arthut Wagner 
dance .facility is part of UCSD's 
vision to build an outstanding 
institution. He said the Wagners 
have had an "unwavering commit-
ment to [UCSD from) retirement 
and beyond." Anagnostopoulos 
also said that "when fortune smiled 
on the Wagners they shared their 
generosity with UCSD." 

Chancellor Dynes also spoke-
highly of Wagner in his speech. 

"Everything great about the the-
ater depanment finds its way back 
to Anhur; Dynes said. 

UCSD has a joint theater Ph.D. 
program with UC Irvine that is two 
years old, and in about four years 
UCSD will have an MFA program in 
dance, according to Jones. 

The dedication ceremony 
included modern ballet and jazz 
performances by students.

ContInued fro. ..... 1 

Potuck, spokesman for the 
Southern Poveny Law Center. a 
nonprofit organization in 
Montgomery. Ala.. that combats 
hate. intolerance and discrimina-
tion nationwide through education 
and litigation. 

Last month in Columbia. Mo .. a 
gay t"9-year-old University of 
Missouri student returned to his 
residence hall to find his gay pride 
posters and photos. ripped or crum-
bled. A swastika was drawn and "F-
ing fags. no more" was written on a 
WaShington State University stu-
dent's door in late September. 

Students sometimes do not 
understand the discr.imination and 
oppression homosexuals encounter 
daily and adapt the attitude that 
gays and lesbians are trying to 
"shove sex down their throats." 

"But it's more about standing 
up for one's self and not being 
ashamed of who I am; he said. 

The recent rise in white nation-
alism is another reason for the 
prevalence of hateful think.ing. 
Potuck said. This results from the 
projection that the majority of the 
country will no longer be white by 
2050. he added. 

According to students walking 
through the Quad on Thursday. 
the antigay messages included "Kill 
the fags" and "Be gay and pay." A 
chalked letter in front of the Hall of 
Languages said that SU and State_ 
University of ew York College of 
Environmental Science and 
Forestry students are "sick and 
tired" of homosexuals forcing their 
lifestyle Onto the straight commu-
nity. 

A flyer similar in tone to the 
chalked message in frOnt of the 
Hall of Languages greeted several 
Hendricks Chapel patrons as they 
grabbed The Dailv Orang!' on 
Thursday morning. 

But the paper's editor in chief 
Dave Levinthal said The Da 
Orange was not aware that the I 
ers were inserted into the par 
Levinthal said the publicr 
does not condone this mess~ _ or 
any other that is considered io be 
hate speech. 

"We plan to notity the universi-
ty that this has happened: said 
Levinthal . a senior newspaper and 
political philosophy major. "And we 
are going to keep a close watch on 
any copies dropped off on campus 
to make sure no one tampers with 
them." 

The Student Association is 
planning to address the Straight 
Pride Union actions at its Monday 
meeting. said Chris Ryan. chairman 
of the SA Board of Elections and 
Membership. 

A resolution will be proposed to 
condemn the hateful actions 
toward SU's gay and lesbian com-
munity. he said. SA will also throw 
its suppOrt behind groups of all 
back.grounds and foster a discus-
sion about the incident.

T he current debate regard-ing online music technol-ogy mirrors that of previ-ous generatons. when industry objected to the 
development of technology that 
increased access to entertainment. 
From the development of vinyl records 
to increased access through the 
Internet. reactions to innovations have 
always been mixed. 

Vinyl records. now considered obso-
lete in the mass-media world. were ini-
tially deemed a threat by the musicians' 
union . It viewed recording technology 
as a threat to the popularity of live per· 
formances. which provided musicians 
with the bulk of their income. accord-
ing to the Washington Post. 

When cassettes were introduced in 
the 1970s. record labels rallied in 
response to fears that home taping 
devices would decimate album sales. In 

actuality. increased access allowed 
record labels to make hundreds of mil-
lions selling re-recorded cassettes. 

Realistically. Internet access does 
pose a certain threat to existing prac-
tices within the recording and music 
industries. Because digital technology. 
unlike tapes. provides a near-perfect 
recording of the original music. there is 
less incentive to buy an original copy. 
Music is also easi ly sent to thousands 
of Internet users. The industry fears 
that without any built-in piracy protec-
tion. CDs that have already been sold 
will be vulnerable to decreases in sales 
due to the fact that they are easily avail-

The mere suggestion of voluntary, solitary confinement is unthinkable to many, but shou/dn t be 
Iy JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Copy Editor 

Exactly two months fr~m today, 
[ expect to be strolling through the 
galleries of Tate Modern, or listen-
ing to the latest and greatest music 
at London 's massive new club 
Home. If my thoughts stray back 
toward California, perhaps I will 
catch an American film at the 
Odeon Cinema in Leicester 
Square. I will not, however, be 

. clinging to ~ny nearby acquain-
tance. 

I'm leaving for London just 
after finals end, 10 days of repose 
and relaxation stretched before me. 
To my friends, the news comes as 
no surprise; I am known as a big 
Anglophile. The surprise crosses 
people's faces, however, when they 
ask and discover that I am gOUlg to 
Britain by myself. 

The answer should not seem 
that unbelievable. This marks the 
second time during my collegiate 
career that I have gone to Britain 
on my own. It's that "on my own" 
part that seems to get to most peo-
ple. 

I have become particularly con-
scious in my two years here that 
society deems it unacceptable -
indeed, bizarre - for a person to 
want to spend time by herself. 

Before coming to San Diego, I 
had never thought much of the fact 
that, as a child and a teen-ager, I 
tended to find ways to amuse 
myself most of the time without the 
aid of anybody else. I wasn't exact-
ly a loner when I was younger; [ 
was simply able to make do with · 
whatever social situation I had to 

settle for. 
The selective pool into which 

secondary school tosses all of us 
did not afford me much of a chance 
to discover a multitude of other 
people with the same interests as I 
had. I quickly grew accustomed to 
the fact that there were certain 
things I would have to do on my 
own, as it was not possible to find 
younger people who shared my 
tastes. I gave up on trying to locate 
other 15-year-olds who would vol-
untarily go to see a film about the 
life of Oscar Wilde or decide a 
museum exhibit about Celtic 
Europe was for them. I was, howev-
er, content to enjoy my own com-
pany when I endeavored to such 
activities. 

By the time I moved to San 
Diego, I was thoroughly accus-
tomed to doing things on my own, 
and happy with it. As my first-year 
roommates did not share any but 
the most mainstream of my inter-
ests, I went right along as I had 
always. 

[t was only after reporting my 
daily doings to others that [ would 
meet with their shock and disbe-
lief . • "You went to a movie by 
yourself?" people would echo. 
"Couldn't you find anybody to go 
with?" 

Well, truth be told, the thought 
to ask others along had never 
crossed my mind. I suppose I had 
been programmed not to e.xpect to 
find a kindred spirit anywhere. [ 
had grown content with everything 
that solitude brings. . 

It is hard to convince others 
that this solitude is something to 
be desired. People are a slave to the

sitting front and center.) 
For me, self-isolation has never 

necessarily $one hand in hand 
with antisoclability; rather, it has 
been the practical answer for a 
desire to be overly social. I have 
often wanted to go out with oth-
ers, but my attempts have been 
thwarted by incompatible sched-
ules, or the laziness of my invitees. 
In such cases, I always figured it 
was better to be content with my 
lot rather than to refuse to go out 
at all . 

I don't dispute that going out 
with people is enjoyable, but [ 
think it ought to be just as enjoy-
able as a silent stroll through· a 
park by oneself. If you cannot 
handle being by yourself volun-
tarily, then what are you going to 
do when you are truly alone? I 
smile every time I think of Blaise 
Pascal's maxim on the subject:

I'm probably the quiet, solitary one living situation drove me to seek 

solace in Britain two winters ago; I 
found that the week by myself 
calmed my nerves like nothing else. 
A trip alone to Las Vegas last spring 
had the same cathartic effect on 
me. 

Going off on one's own is also a 
nice way to assert independence. I 
think my parents knew that I was-
n't the most savvy character when 
it carne to directions and street 
smarts. I still don't even know the 
names of the main streets that run 
through my town. Maybe my next 
venture should be an exciting after-
noon in downtown Walnut Creek, 
Calif. 

However, I am certain that my 
parents' respect for my ability to 
take care of myself increased after I 
carne home intact from my initial 
trip alone. When I make an exten-
sive journey somewhere by myself, 
I have nobody to bail me out for my 
own mistakes. The challenge of 
such an endeavor can test nto only 
a person's patience, but also her 
resourcefulness and common 
sense. 

I have no doubts that my 
sojourn abroad this December will 
be as pleasing as my ventures of the 
previous months. Having people 
with whom to share it would be fun 
in its own way, but I know that 
being by myself will not detract 
from my enjoyment of the time 
spent. 

[n a hierarchy that is social by 
nature, it is difficult to convince 
people of the benefits of being 
alone, but I refuse to be daunted by 
puzzled looks when I account for

A step down on the pyramid are 
the vice chancellors. 

The vice chancellor of academic 
affairs is Marsha Chandler. She is a 
fellow of the Royal Society of 
Canada, which is the highest acad-
emic honor that can be bestoWild 
in that country. As the vice chan-
cellor of academic affairs at UCSD, 
Chandler is responsible for all poli-
cies and decisions that relate to 
academic programs and curricu-
lum. She also is in charge of facul-
ty appointments and performance. 
Chandler also acts as UCSD's chief 
operating officer and acts on behalf 
of the chancellor in his absense. 

The person in charge of busi-
ness at UCSD is Steven W. Relyea. 

extern.al relations is James Langley. 
The department's mission state-
ment, as printed on its Web site, 
http://www-er.ucsd.edu.is "managing 
UCSD's interactions with a diverse 
group of external constituents." 
UCSD's External Relations depart-
ment is in charge of dealing with 
such entities as contributors and 
press. The university'S communica-
tions department falls under the 
category of external relations. 

David N. Bailey is the interim 
vice chancellor of health sciences. 
He also serves as the dean for the 
UCSD School of Medicine. Bailey 
oversees all university decisions 

regarding the school of medicine 
and the ·other health science 
departments on campus. 

The vice chancellor of marine 
sciences is Charles Kennel. Kennel 
also serves as the director of the 
Scripps Institutioll of 
Oceanography. He oversees the 
everyday operations of the insti-
tute. He also oversees till' marine 
sciences for the university. 

John Woods is the vice chancel-
lor in charge of resource manage- . 
ment and planning. He handles 
such things as the UCSD Policy 
and Procedure Manual. The office 
of resource management and plan-
ning is also in charge of processing 
all of the chancellor's mail. 

The vice chancellor of student 
affairs is Joseph W. Watson. 
Watson takes care of contacting 
students to come to UCSD. He and 
his staff help promote intellectual 
learning, social growth, physical 
activity, psychological counseling 
and ethical values among students. 
They also cover areas of ollr school 
that include career services, cam~ 
pus recreation, intercollegiate ath-
letics and the sports facilities. 

For local college life, there is an 
entirely different system that mim-
ics our local city governments 
more than our national govern-
ment. The provost of a college is a 
tenured member of the faculty that 
makes sure the entire "college 
machine" runs smoothly and effec-
tively. The provost creates, provides 
and implements programs that are . 
designed to help students. 
Provosts also serve as chairmen of 
a faculty/st\ldent committee, the 
College Executive Committee, 
which has final authority for acad-
emic programs. The provosts for 
the five colleges, Revelle, Muir, 
Marshall, Warren, Roosevelt, are 
Thomas Bond, Patrick j. Ledden, 
Cecil Lytle, David K. Jordan and 
Ann L. Craig, respectively.

What did you think of the first two presidential debates? 

"Overall, they were a 
little bit intense and not 
quite on the sporting par 
of what would be a high 
school debate. There 
was a lot of 
argumentation. There 
was- a lot less discussion 
and more argument. I 
didn't think that anyone 
had a particular 
advantage, not from the 
debate forum itself. It 
was evenly matched in 
the way that the format 
was. How they did it wa~ 

~omething else."

exaggerate too much. I 
think that Bush had a 
clear vision and 
knowledge of the 
country."

"I think that Nader 
deserves more publicity. 
Just bec~use he doesn't 
get so many percentages 
of the votes and he 
doesn't have as many 
petiti()n signatures or 
whatever it is that gets 
you in~o debates, and just 
because he is a third-
party candidate doesn't 
mean that he shouldn't 
get aU the attention that 
the other ones do. He 
has interesting ~d 
different things to say, 
and the public should get 
to hear it."

"I think that the debates 
are further proving that 
while Bush may be 
trying to attack Gore's 
character, he realizes 
that he can't win on 
policy issues. Gore is 
just showing his 
strength in policy, and 
that is what is going to 
propel Gore to the 
presidency."

greater opportunity for expansion. 

"It's like VCRs, which the movie 
studios initially tried to sue off the 
market, figuring that it would ruin 
interest in first-run movies: said 
Ric Dube, an analyst with 
Webnoize, an online marketing 
research company, to the 
Washington Post. "The VCR quadru-
pled the size of the movie business 
by multiplying excitement about 
the movies. That's 

by Doug Camplejohn and David 
Pakman that was inspired by 
Camplejohn's frustration with 
online music technology. 

"I was just trying to copy a few 
songs onto my Rio [MP3 playerl 
for the first time," he recalls. "At 
one point I just sat back and 
laughed because there were five 
windows open in my computer and 
aliI was trying to do was create the 
digital equivalent of a short mix 
tape-" 

Instead of giving up, this rock-
star-wannabe de.cided to fix the 
problem himself, and he and 
Pakman created myplay. They have 
worked together with people like 

former CDNOW

do for music."

in which users are targeted based 
on the actual music they keep in 
their online music "locker," and on

Registering to use myplay is

to submit their e-mail address, first

user access to the service and a free 
digital locker where they can store 
music.

Arlee (March 21·Apri/19) 
Information you gather on 

Monday and Thesday could lead 
to a change in plans. Don't take 
off on a trip until you're sure 
where you'foe going. A shortage of 
money inspires creativity on 
Wednesday, and by Thursday you 
should have the problem solved. 
Make something you want for 
your home, instead of buying new. 
Finally, you get the green light for 
travel on Friday. Take off as soon 
as possible. You might as well 
sleep late over the weekend, how-
ever. There's confusion early on 
both Saturday and Sunday . . 

' .. ru. (Apri/20-May 20) 
If you get a windfall Monday, 

put it into your savings account. 
Your hard work brings in the 
bonus on Tuesday. On Wednesday 
you're going back and forth with 
your partner about a trivial detail. 
Just say you're sorry, and things 
will ·move along much faster. 
Study on Thursday to get ahead. 
You should stay close to home 
from Friday through Sunday, but 
not necessarily alone. Have dear 

I friends over on Sunday. Ignore a 

stupid remark a loved one makes 
on Sunday, by the way. It wasn't 
meant to hurt your feelings, so 
don't let it. 

8eIIIIni (May 21·June 21) 
You're strong on Monday and 

Tuesday ·cause the moon's in your 
sign. That doesn't mean you'll get 
everything you want, however. 
Well , go ahead and give it a try. 
The overall outcome is positive. 
On Wednesday and Thursday the 
focus is on money. By following 
an older person 's advice, you 
could pick up an extra job that 
will bring in a few more coins. On 
Friday and Saturday your key 
word is "study: Concentrate so 
you can sort fact from fantasy. 
Clean house on Sunday 'cause an 
inspection'S coming soon. 

c.c... (June 22-July 22) 
Your mind will be buzzing on 

Monday and Tuesday, especially if 
you get a new assignment. Focus 
on caring for others, and you'll do 
fine. On Wednesday the moon 
goes into your sign, which gives 
you the advantage. Romance goes 
well ' on both Wednesday and 
Thursday. Balance your budget on 
Friday and modify your outgo to 
match your income. More is com-
ing, but it's not here yet. Do more 
planning Saturday and Sunday. 
Figure out what's going to be hap-
pening next week so you'll be 
ready for it. 

Leo (July 23·Aug. 22) 
Your buddies want to talk you 

into all sorts of things on Monday 
and Tuesday. Some of their 
schemes will fall flat. You must 
decide which ones will . On 
Wednesday and Thursday your 
conscience may nag you. Pay back 
and return everything you've bor-

rowed. On Friday and Saturday 
the moon's in your sign . Romance 
looks nice on Friday night, so fol -
low through on that idea. Reality 
strikes on Sunday, as you realize 
you spent more than you should 
have. Shuffle things around so 
that everybody's happy. 

VI,.. (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
Monday you've got domestic 

chores. Don't upset the boss by 
being late, however. You 'll want to 
make a good impression on 
Tuesday 'cause you might be able 
to advance your career then. On 
Wednesday a group or committee 
meeting goes exceptionally well . 
You might even get a position of 
responsibility. Settle into a dull 
routine Friday and Saturday. 
Expect action on Sunday. (f you're 
thinking of inviting people over, 
check with your roommate first. 
He or she may have other plans. 

Un (Sept. 23·0ct. 23) 
If you're starting a trip on 

Monday, expect confusion 
Tuesday morning. If you ca n start 
on Tuesday afternoon instead. 
things will go more smoothly. A 
long-distance co nnection via 
phone or modem ca'n get through 
either day if you set it on auto-
send. On Wednesday watch your 
manners. An older person is 
watching you . Look good and 
busy, and all's well. Friday and 
Saturday your first inclination is 
to dump the job and run off with 
your friends. Luckily, you 're hav-

Myplay: 
Music lockers are not 
opposed by music industry 
ContInIIed froIII ...,. 21 
MP3.com. myplay has consumers 
store the music they select into a 
Ulocker" on the Web. 

These lockers make access to 
this digital musical collection easi-
er because members can access 
their music from anywhere in the 
world where they have access to 
the Internet. Each member's per-
sonalized lockers can be used to 
store tracks that can be organized 
into DJ mixes. Additionally. users 
can download mixes onto a 
portable player by designing their 
own tracks. or they can listen to 
other members' public DJ mixes. 

The private storage locker pro- . 
vides three Gigabyte of space on 
the Web. which is the equivalent of 
60 CDs at 128 kilobytes per secol1d 
(CD quality) or 300 CDs at 24kbps 
(AM radio quality). The company 
also offers_an "infinite locker" fea-
ture. where members can add an 
unlimited amount of music to their 
locker when they obtain it from 
partners that use myplay's "add to 
locker" button . These affiliates 
include emusic.com, 
rollingstone.com and America 
Online's Winamp. 

uThe 'add to locker' button 
takes the hassle out of download-
ing and makes acquiring music as 
easy as a single click." Pakman stat-

.ed. uThe overwhelming amount of 
our customers who are moving 
music into their lockers from the 
Web and our partners is stagger-
ing.w 

There are several ways to 
acquire music for your locker col-
lection, according to myplay's Web 
site, hrtp:llwww.myplay.com. 
Consumers can add music to their 
lockers by pulling music off the 
Web; they can "rip" music from 

their own CD collection so that it 
can be accessed off the Web site; 
and they can share music from 
myplay affi liates by using the

The UCSD Guardian 

Myplay boasts that it is the first 
legal and industry-supported online 
music service. According to compa-
ny founder and CEO Doug 
Camplejohn, staying within the 
limits of copyright laws is important 
to myplay. ~efore he even devel-
oped the business. Camplejohn sat 
down with co-founder Pakman and 
a copyright 1awyer to review their 
options. Currently there are a lot of 
fuzzy boundaries in terms of copy-
right boundaries. However. wherev-
er the boundaries exist. myplay 
aims to keep the company's activi-
ties on the legal side. 

"Two decisions we made when 
. we staned the company were, let's 
build a service that doesn't rely on 
us having to get licenses that aren't 
available today from record compa-
nies and rights holders in order to 
have a product. And second. let's 
make sure that everything we do 
stays within the bounds of the law 
so that we have a relationship with 
the people who own 99 percent of 
the world's music - the major 
record labels, and the artists and the 
publishers." Camplejohn stated. 

The philosophy of the company 
is that access to the site should 
remain free to users. However. 
myplay does work to compensate 
artists for their work. They pay roy-
alties for copyrighted works and 
abide by restrictions that were 
recently devised for Internet radio 
stations. 

Restrictions for users are fairly 
simple. Playlists cannot have more 
than three tracks from the same 
CD or four tracks from one artist. 
Playlists do not allow users to skip 
from track to track. Pakman stated. 
The site automatically modifies 
users' play lists to conform to these 
restrictions. 

The restriction agreement that 
consumers must abide by to access 
the site is lengthy, but wovides 
protection to the company and to 
artists so that myplay abides by the 
constraints of the law.

and Other Rebellions: and start-
ed such prominent feminist orga· 
nizations as the Ms. Foundation 
for Women, Women's Action 
Alliance, and Voters for Choice. 

Steinem was a 1998 inductee 
into the National Women's Hall 
of Fame as recognition for her 
many efforts as an activist for the 
rights of women nation-wide. 

On Sept. 6, Steinem, who 
claimed that she had really never 
considered marriage, married 
South African-born entrepreneur 
David Bale at the age of 66 in a 
move that both shocked and dis-
appointed many feminists. 

Despite the controversy, she 
continues to speak out for 
women's rights, as evident by her 
trip to UCSD to give a speech on 
abortion rights. 

Assembfywoman Davis, who is 
running against Congressman 
Brian Bilbray this November for 
California's 49th Congressional 
District, is another featured speak-
er. Davis has served as president of 
the League of Woman Voters in 
San Diego and president of the 
California Elected Women's 
Association for Education and 
Research, and she endorses legis· 
lation that would force HMOs to 
allow women to choose their own 
obstetricians and gynecologists. 

Filner is afso tentatively 
scheduled to speak. Filner is a 
congressman in California 's 50th 
district. He has served in 
Congress since winning by a two-
to-one margin in 1992. 

During his term in Congress, 
Filner has championed several 
women's issues. He sponsored a 
bill to establish a national muse-
um of women's history, and in 
general, has be.en a vocal sup-
porter of the elimination of dis-
crimination against women. 

Also tentatively scheduled to 
speak is Kennedy, a Democratic 
congressman from the first con · 
gress iona l dis trict in Rhode 
Island. Kennedy, the cousin of the 
late John F. Kennedy Jr., was 
elected to office in 1998 . While in 
office, Ken nedy has been a voca l 
supporter of women's r ights.

Duke Pays $2 million 
The Chronicle 

GREENSBORO, N.C. -In what 
could have been the end of a three· 
year legal battle between Duke 
University and Heather Sue Mercer, 
the verdict came Thursday in favor 
of the anguished ex-football player. 

Mercer was awarded a total of 
$2,000,001 in damages - $2 million 
of which was meant to punish and 
deter the university from ever again 
showing deliberate indifference to 
complaints of discrimination. 

The jury's compensatory award 
of $1 represents its belief that 
Mercer deserved to be compensat-
ed for the damages she incurred, 
but that those damages could not 
be measured. 

"I feel great; M ercer sa id. "I 
worked for years to be heard. [ was 
heard by a jury of my peers, they 
ruled in favor of me. I understand it 
as a complete victory: But John 
Burness, senior vice president for 
public affairs and government rela-
tions, said in a statement Thursday 
night that the case is not over yet. 

"We:re obviously disappointed 
with the jury's finding and are con-
fident the judgment will be recti-
fied on appeal." he said. 

And when other university offi --
cials, both past and 'present, were 
informed of the decision, they 
could only express disbelief. 

"You're kidding me, you got to 
be kidding: said former football

CD III I ed".. .... 12 
Thtons' fresh legs proved to be 
too much for Grand Canyon, as 
there was qUick action with a 
UCSD-attempted goal hitting the 
crossbar. The crowd let out a col-
lective groan because the Antelope 
goalie was nowhere near, and a 
goal had been imminent. 

As the clock ran to the 90-
minute mark, the Tritons had one 
last coup left. At 88:50 an unas-
sisted Kri sten Conahan slipped 
the ball past the Grand Canyon 
goalie and into the net. A scoreless 
minute later, the gam e ended with 
a final score of 4-1 . 

coach Fred Goldsmith. "I just basi-
cally .... The only thing I. can say is 
what I said about her kicking abili-
ty. She didn't have the ability. That 
was apparent to the people that had 
seen her kick. That's all I'll say: 

After hearing the verdict in 
favor of the plaintiff, both sides 
were given 15 minutes to speak to 
the jury concerning damages. 

Although both sides refused to 
specify an amount they thought 
was appropriate, the plaintiffs 
requested that Mercer receive at 
least the cost of four years of 
tuition as remuneration for her 
experiences at Duke. Less than an 
hour later, the jury emerged and 
announced its decision. 

"I'm very much surprised. Well , I 
was first surprised it ever went to . 
trial and now ['m surprised .... 1 
thought if we were guilty of anything 
it was letting her tome out in the 
first place; said assistant football 
coach Fred Chatham, who worked 
with ·Mercer and the team's other 
kickers. "The jury must have seen 
something [ must not be.aware of: 

Athletic Director Joe Alleva was 
also taken aback at the case's out-
come. 

"Of course I'fn disappointed. 
I'm just disappointed. I'm sur-
prised and I'm disappointed: 
Alleva, who became Duke's athlet-
ic director in 1998, said from his 
Durham home. "I think that's more 
than what she was even asking for, 
and I'm very surprised: 

McManus was pleased with the 
soccer his team played, and felt 
that the last goal was the cherry on 
top. 

"By that fourth goal , we felt 
pretty good . We deserved that 
fourth : McManus said . "[t was a 
fierce game, but it was able to be 
done." . 
. With three games left in league 

play, the Tritons need to manage at 
least two wins and a tie to cinch a 
playoff spot. Conahan feels th is is 
a defi n ite possibility. 

"Our philosophy is to take each 
game one at a time and stay 
tough," he said. "We don 't know 
what to expect, but we know that 
it is possible: 

The Tritons play next Monday 
in a nonconfe rence match against 
California Baptist Untversity at 7. 
p.m. at RIMAC fie ld.

30 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Volleyball is Victorious at Chico 
Delving deep into the boondocks of Northern California the Tritons get a W 
By ICon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

The school year is officially 
underway, a(ld the long, warm, 
carefree days of summer are now 
just a wistful memory. As the quar-
ter progresses and fall really begins 
to take hold, the students at UCSD 
have come to the realization that 
now is the time to buckle down and 
really take care of business. 

The members of the women's 
volleyball team are no different, as 
they went on the road to Chico last 
week and picked up a crucial victo-
ry in their bid for postseason dom-
ination. 

On Friday night, the Tritons 
headed up the coast to Chico State 
to do battle with their dreaded 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival. There was not 
much for the Tritons to fear on this 
spooky Friday the 13th, however, as 
fhey handily dispatched the Chico 
squad in a 3-1 bludgeoning. 

The Blue and Gold established 
themselves early, capturing the first 
game 15-9 to take the early lead. 
Again, in what has been a season-
long trend, the Tritons let their 
guard down in the second game, and 

their opponents took them to task 
for the lack of concentration, this 
time to the tune of a 7-15 score. 

The Thtons came out with teeth 
bared in the third set, though, and 
stayed mean over the duration of the 
next two games, letting the prover-
bial dogs out, winning with scores of 

The Tritons are 
tightening up their game 
as they head into the 
waning weeks of the 
2000 campaign and just 
now seem to be hitting 
their stride, 
15-6 and 15-7 to clinch the victory. 

The Chico State players just 
could not keep up with UCSD's 
relentless attack, and the Thtons 
moved one step closer to assuring 
themselves a spot in regional play. 

Outstanding performances were 
plentiful for the 1ritons in this win, 
as many key players once again 
stood out on the floor, while, at the 
same time, some new faces emerged 
to contribute heavily in the win. . 

Jennie Wilson once again had a 
solid day on the floor, compiling 11 
kills and seven digs, while team-
mate Kathleen Hentz also stood 
out with 10 kills for UCSD. 

The ever-impressive Leslie 
Punelli delivered another strong 
performance, chipping in 12 digs, 
while Kearney Visser and Laura 
Santerre had her back with 10 
apiece. 

Diana Camarilft> picked her 
game up a notch against Chico, 
throwing down a Triton-high 13 
kills and picking up eight digs in 
the match. 

Chico was led by Amber Crezee, 
who had a match-high 17 kills and 
11 digs in the losing effort. 

The Tritons are tightening up 
their game as they head into the 
waning weeks of the 2000 campaign, 
and just now seem to be hitting their 
stride. If they can ride this momen-
tum into the postseason, which is 
looming in the imminent future, the 
Triton side should find success. 

Next weekend the Tritons travel 
north in an all-important trip to 
Sonoma State and San Francisco 
State Universities, where they will 
face off in two decisive CCAA 
showdowns.

Fans of Iverson will show up to 
arenas to watch him score points 
on the court, and not to watch him 
rap on stage. The consensus 
among fans of Shaq, Kobe and the 
few out there who even know 
Iverson has a record out and who 
will actually pay money for it rather 
than download it off Napster is that 
these guys can't rap as well as those 
whose rap albums we normally 
buy. With the exception of Shaq 
when he rapped with Peter Gunz 
and Lord Tariq, I can't remember 
when an NBA player had a popular 
song on the radio. 

In my opinion; record stores 
should put rap by pro athletes with 
'80s music (sorry '80s fans) - the 
kind of sound that makes you say 

~Oh god, what are we listening to?" 
- or else, only release their rap on 

. cassette so people will have a hard 
time finding their names in the 
store. 

Remember when Deion 
rapped? Hear his music in your 
head if it somehow stuck with you 
and note your reaction. I give Shaq 
credit for his music, not just 
because of what he signifies to bas-
ketball and the Lakers, but because 
I believe he could compete with 
bigger heads in the industry if he 
wasn 't a b-ball player. The man 
actually has some talent. 

As for every other pro-sport 
M.e., at best they're ear candy with 
no other redeeming musical value; 
and at worst, they're on a CD you 
could resell to a store for two bucks 
- that is if you haven 't been care-
less with it and scratched it all up. If 
basketball players spent more time 
practicing their sport and less in 
the studio, the NBA would be even 
more exciting to watch .

By ISAAC PURUlAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
fortified its position atop the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association with a thrilling 1-0 
overtime victory against second-
ranked Grand Canyon Friday 
night at RlMAC field. The win 
pushed the Thtons' overall record 
to 10-2-1, 8-2-1 in league play, 
while Grand Canyon fell to 8-5-2, 
6-4 league. 

Head coach Derek Armstrong 
was very pleased with hiS'leam's 
standing. ~We're exactly where we 
want to be at the moment; he 
said. "Our position. is pretty 
good," 

The conquest was made pos-
sible by a swarfr\ing 'Triton 
defense that stifled Grand 
Canyon the entire game, and an 
~ggressive offense, which con-
trolled the ball the whole game 
and had several drives deep into 
Antelope territory. 

. "It was more a team perfor-
mance than anything else:· 
Armstrong said. "We had to playa 
bit more cautious than normal, 
due to their strong counterat-
tack." 

The game began with the 
Antelopes anacking right away, 
though the UCSD defense quick-
ly snuffed out the assault and 
reduced Grand Canyon's effor:£ to 
a weak shot on goal. 

The Tritons picked up 
momentum after Grand Canyon 
was whistled for offsides, with 
junior Bobby Saadati and senior 
Brady Bernard creating excellent 
scoring opportunities for them-

selves but coming up short. After 
Saadati was unable to capitalize 
on another opportunity, in which 
he breezed by two defenders but 
shot wide, the Antelopes: frustra-
tion was evident when a defender 
grabbed a Triton's leg and shoved 
him back off the ball. 

UCSD's best opportunity 
came about 20 minutes into the 
half, when the Grand Canyon 
goalie came out of the goal to 
deflect the ball and a headed shot 
by the Thtons was knocked out by 
a defender. 

"It was more a team 
performance than 
anything else, we had to 
play a bit more cautious 
than normal ,.,." 

- .,.. AMstroIC 
Men's Soccer Head Coach 

As the first half wound to a 
close, the play on both sides got 
more and more physical as each 
team tried to gain an advantage. 
Freshman Triton defender 
Jonathan Shum responded to the 
Antelopes' aggression with some 
physical play of his own, making 

. several nice tackles to knock the 
ball loose from Grand Canyon. 

The Antelopes' offense, sub-
dued by the Tritons' smothering 
defense, showed its exasperation 

~hen Giber Becera was warned by 
the referee after kicking the ball in 
frustratio.n when play had been 
stopped. 

At the end of the half, Saadati 

again had another scoring oppor-
tunity in front of the goal, but he 
tripped and got tangled up with 
the Antelope goalie. 

In the second half, the Triton 
offense again dominated time of 
possession, and Grand Canyon 
continued to show its frustration 
as Becera was given a yellow card 
in the 54th minute. However, 
UCSD couldn't capitali1.e, as 
freshman midfielder Sean 
Summers had his shot blocked 
in front of the goal and junior 
midfielder Robert Guido 
unleashed a wide shot that JUSt 
missed the goal. Sophomore 
Kristopher Chiles also had an 
opportunity from a corner kick 
but shot high. 

With about two minutes left, a 
breakaway by the 'Tritons was 
negated by a questionable off-
sides call. Bernard then unleashed 
another shot with time winding 
down and missed the goal. 

Two minutes and 16 seconds 
into overtime, freshman midfie1d-
er Ryan Mizumoto decided 
enough was enough as he drove 
straight through the middle and 
beat the Grand Canyon goalie to 
win the game. 

Although the 'Tritons need JUSt 
one more win to cinch a playoff 
spot, Armstrong is not thinking 
about the playoffs. 

"We'll get there when we get 
there: he said. "The gate isn't 
really open yet. We'll open it with 
three more points: 

The Tritons will have their 
chance to open the gate next 
Friday, when they meet Grand 
Canyon once again, this time in 
Phoenix. 

Due to illness and precaution, 
several runners were unable to par-
ticipate. They included David 
Dunbar and Julian Nahan, the top 
two men's runners;

He also said that he is happy

Despite what many people may

sport. Van Arsdale stresses the 
importance of team cohesion on 
and off the track. lie said one of his 
biggest goals is to get the team to 
think in terms of "us" and "we" 
rather than "I" and "me: This

· We race for the

explained that the cross country 
team at UCSD works hard to rep-

students. 

"The runners are seeking to 
bridge the gap between the athletic 
community at UCSD and the gen-
eral student body: Van Arsdale said. 

Every Friday before meets, all 
the cross country runners wear 
their jackets to class, not looking 
for personal recognition , but rather 
as an attempt to bridge this gap by 
showing' the rest of UCSD they are 
working hard to represent them on 
the cross country course." 

So, this Friday when you see 
someone pass you on Library Walk 
or in the Price Center wearing that 
UCSD cross country team jacket, 
wish them luck in their upcoming

I t is difficult at times being a sports fan in San Diego. The city's two major sports fran-
chises, tlfe Padres and the Chargers, 
wallow away in the doldrums and 
strive for mediocrity. 

The Padres just wrapped up yet 
another last-place campaign, and 
the future does not look any better 
for the squad. It is looking to cut 
salaries for the upcoming year, and 
that means more young, inexperi-
enced players, so it is a long way 
from being a serious contender 
again. 

Also, the Padres' ballpark plans 
are quickly going down the toilet 
and would take a miracle to revive. 
Ralph Nader will become president 
before that place gets built.

Allen Iverson 
Raps His Way 
Into Trouble 

BriR.n's 
BujJiJlo Chips 

BRIAN WELLES 

W hat makes Philadelphia 76er Allen Iverson differ-ent from his teammates? 
He has a higher scoring average for 
one, and he raps. 

After being sharply criticized 
for lyrics offensive toward gays and 
women on his debut album, 
Iverson had a chance to respond at 
a press conference in Philadelphia 
Tuesday. Mostly civil rights groups 
attacked his lyrics, but why is his 
case different from just about every 
hip-hop album released? 

Sure, we've seen attempts at a 
rap career by Shaq, Kobe Bryant, 
and even former Laker Cedric 
Ceballos. Until now, professional 
basketball players haven 't had the 
kind of derogatory lyrics that we by 
now expect from professional rap-
pers. 

Is Iverson being treated unfair-
ly? To me, he 's just another rap-
per with offensive lyrics, no dif-
ferent from Eminem or any of the 
other gangsta' rappers out there. 
But protesters shouldn't be 
standing outside the basketball 

. arena voicing their dissent direct-
ly at Iverson. 

I think that because he's a star, 
these civil rights activists are mak-
ing an example out of him in order 
to point to the larger institution of 
violence, racism and sexism in rap . 
music. 

Why don't these protesters 
leave Iverson alone and direct their 
opposition toward the American 
Civil L~berties Union or Congress, 
who will be more likely to hear 
them out and make a change?

other teams at the Triton Cross 
Country Invitational. 

Although the men's and

fourth in their respective fields, 
with one UCSD men's runner, 
Nathan Garcia, and two women's

The Tritons ~llow a goal for the first time in 
six games, but still pull out a win 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Staff Writer 

Demonstrating its skills as the 
newcomer to Division II action, 
the UCSD women's soccer team 
defeated Grand Canyon University 
4-1 at RlMAC Field Friday night. 

Grand Canyon, with a 3-9-1 
overall record, went into the 
match ranked fourth in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South Division. 

UCSD, which is currently the 
No. 1 seed, improved its record to 
10-2-0 overall and 9-2-0 in league 
play. Its record in the South 
Division has secured it the 14th 
spot in the NCAA national rank-
ings. 

As the end of the soccer season 
draws near, with playoffs just 
around the corner, every game is 
important, according to head 
coach Brian McManus. 

"We were a little nervous, but 
it's nothing that we can't handle: 
McManus said. 

In what was to be a very physi-
cal game, UCSD began scoring at 
the 23 :10 mark. Christy Abiziad 
assisted Cindy Dostalek for a goal 
that riled up the crowd and set the 
stage for a successful game. 

"Grand Canyon is always very 
physical: McManus said . ·We 
expected that going into the gap1e, 
but it doesn't bother us at all." 

The Tritons rolled past the 
Antelopes' goalie for their second 
goal, when Lauren Jacobs scored 
off a pass from Kristin Jones at 
34:04, bringing the score to 2-0. 

UCSD played tough defense 

the whole game and was not look-
ing to be scored upon by Grand 
Canyon, as it has remained 
unscored upon for the last six 
games. 

Forty-three minutes into the 
game, Abizaid attempted a goal, 
but it was blocked by Grand 
Canyon goalie Anna Fischer. The 
ball traveled quickly back and 
forth across the field as the teams 
rallied for a goal, but to no avail. 

Kristin Conahan, a Triton mid-
fielder, felt the confidence of the 
team rise following the early goals. 

"After the first couple of goals, 
it helped our game to know that 
we were ahead,· Conahan said. 
"Th is enabled us to stay strong for 
the entire game, and stay tough for 
what was a very physical match." 

Proving the physicality of the
