Under President Barack Obama’s 
proposed 2010-11 budget, the 
Department of Education would 
receive $46.7 billion toward fund-
ing various student-loan programs, 
aimed at increasing affordability and 
accessibility for college students.

The Senate and House of 
Representatives approved two similar 
versions of the $3.5 trillion federal bud-
get last week, which would both sup-
port an increase of the maximum Pell 
Grant award from $5,350 in 2009-10 to 
$5,500 for the 2010-11 academic year.

Congress will work to reach a com-
promise on the two versions of the 
budget beginning April 21.

The Department of Education 
was allotted $59.2 billion from the 
2009-10 budget, and Congress already 
approved an additional $81.1 billion 
from the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act earlier this year.

“While these budget resolutions 
are only guidelines for the final fed-
eral spending plan for 2010, early 
indications that we are pleased to see 
include a possible increase in funding 
for higher education — especially for 
Pell grants, which are so important to 
our students,” UC spokesman Chris 
Harrington said.

Lastly, the budget would eliminate 
the Federal Family Education Loan 
Program — issued through banks 
and other private lenders — mak-
ing the Federal Direct Loan Program, 
which is funded by the Department 
of Education, the single option for 
students seeking financial support. 
It would also increase funding for 
the Federal Perkins Loan Program 
from $1 billion to $5 billion, while 
doubling the 1,800 colleges that cur-
rently participate in the program. The 
plan would provide an estimated 2.7 
million additional students with the 
Perkins Loan — a five-fold increase 
over the existing 500,000 students 
receiving the loan now. 

The United States Student 
Association — a student-led organi-
zation whose members include sev-
eral UC students — is lobbying for 
the House of Representatives’ version 
of the bill, due to its higher non-
discretionary spending on programs 
that the government considers man-
datory, such as Social Security. It also 
includes “budget reconciliation,” a 
controversial partisan procedural tac-

Top: Independent candidate Utsav Gupta won the A.S. presidency by a sizeable margin, claiming 
over 2,800 votes. Above left: Adam Teitelbaum, presidential candidate for the newly formed

Tears and beer flowed in near-equal quantities at Round Table Pizza Friday night, when a crowd of anx-

Tension quickly dissolved into drunken 
excitement on the crowded restaurant patio 
when the candidates and their supporters 
spotted election manager Frank Carroll — 
sole bearer of the results — arriving after a 
four-hour elections-grievance hearing. 

Carroll’s eventual arrival was met with 
applause and scattered heckling, the most 
poignant of which came from outgoing A.S.

During the four hours 
before A.S. election results 
were announced last Friday, the 
Elections Review Committee 
found the Student Voice! slate 
guilty of campaign plagiarism 
and found two college senator 
candidates guilty of illicit “dorm 

storming” practices.
A.S. President-elect Utsav 

Gupta filed a violations report 
on April 9, accusing 
Student Voice! of pla-
giarizing the campaign 
phrase “Uncage Sun 
God” and several other 
elements of his Web 
site. 

Sixth college juniors 
Brian Ng and Mona 
Vakilifathi, who pre-
sented the case on 
Gupta’s behalf, argued 
that “uncaging” Sun God was an 
original idea, coined and used by 
Gupta throughout his campaign 
and on his Web site. The site was 

launched March 9, well before 
Student Voice! used the same 
term on a Web site launched 

April 1. 
Ng and Vakilifathi 

also argued that 
Student Voice! plagia-
rized the image slide-
show and pop-up text 
featured on Gupta’s 
Web site  — as well as 
two images comple-
menting his platforms 
to halt tuition increas-
es and protect free 

speech.
“The similarities on the Web 

sites are too common,” Vakilifathi 
said. 

Ng said Gupta was not look-
ing to disqualify Student Voice! 
from the election, but was merely 
seeking a public apology and 
removal of the Web site.

A.S. Elections Manager Frank 
Carroll mediated the discussion. 

Rishi Ghosh, creator of the 
Student Voice! Web site, defend-
ed the slate’s right to use the 
images by arguing that they were 
acquired through free, public-
domain sources. He said that the 
code and software used to layout 
the Web site were completely dif-
ferent than those used by Gupta.

Ghosh also argued that the

idea of an “uncaged” Sun God was 
first coined last year by writers at the 
Guardian, making Gupta’s claim of 
original ownership unfounded.  

After hearing both sides, the 
committee voted that the phrase 
“Uncage Sun God” was not Gupta’s 
original idea and therefore not pla-
giarized, but that the Student Voice! 
Web site as a whole was plagia-
rized. However, committee members 
then voted that the plagiarism was 
not a violation of the A.S. Election 
Code, and decided to take no action 
against the Student Voice! slate. 

In addition, Marshall Senator-
elect Brian McEuen accused 
Marshall Senator-elect Shervin 
Sarraf Anghoozeh of “dorm storm-
ing,” — the act of soliciting door 
to door in residence halls — while  
Warren College Council President-
elect Emily Law and Warren 
Senator-elect Josh Grossman made 
similar accusations against Warren 
senator candidate Tyler Nelson.

The committee found Nelson 
guilty of illegally posting campaign 
flyers on the doors of several Warren 
College apartments, but voted 
against disqualifying him. Instead, 
the committee decided that Nelson 
should apologize to Grossman. 

Similarly, Anghoozeh was found 
guilty of illegally contacting Marshall 
residents to encourage them to vote. 
The committee asked him to issue an 
apology to the three residents he had 
contacted who helped present the 
case against him.

President Donna Bean.
“Get to the part that matters, 

Frank!” Bean cried as Carroll explained 
the single transferable voting system, 
in which students rank candidates in 
order of preference.

Independent presidential candidate 
Utsav Gupta emerged victorious by a 
landslide, claiming leadership of the 
council and putting an end to three 
consecutive years of Student Voice! 
domination over the coveted top office. 

Though he celebrated excitedly, 
surrounded by a cheering entourage 
of friends and campaign staffers, the 
triumphant Gupta adopted a serious 
tone to acknowledge the challenges of 
his new position.

“The first thing I’m going to do is 
learn,” Gupta said. “There’s a lot I have 
to learn if I’m going to accomplish 
things for the student body and do 
everything I promised. It’s a sizeable 
responsibility and I understand that, 
but I think the students are willing to 
work with me. Students want to see 
an A.S. [Council] that does tangible 
things for them. The first step to doing 
that is to learn as much as I can before 
I take office.”

Trailing Gupta by just under 1,000 
votes was second-place candidate 
Adam Teitelbaum, face of the newly 
established Clean Slate. Student Voice! 
candidate Erin Brodwin followed 
Gupta and Teitelbaum, securing the 
fewest votes among the three presiden-
tial hopefuls.

“I think all three of us ran a very 
solid race,” Teitelbaum said after 
Gupta’s victory. “I think Utsav and 
Erin were phenomenal candidates, and 
I think any three of us in the position 
would have done great things. The 
students spoke, and they chose who 
they wanted.”

Gupta will be joined in his execu-
tive post by new Vice President of 

Finance and Resources Peter Benesch, 
Vice President of Student Life Ricsie 
Hernandez and Vice President of 
External Affairs Gracelynne West.

The newly elected councilmembers 
will take over seventh week. 

Benesch, who worked with outgo-
ing VP Finance Naasir Lakhani to 
develop a new system of allocating 
funds to student organizations, said he 
will devote his attention to ensuring 
the success of this revised process.

“I want to make it easier for stu-

dent orgs to go to A.S. so they’ll have 
funding for their events,” he said. 
“They’re so stressed because they want 
to do this and this and they don’t have 
money for it. There are always barriers 
to them doing what we want them to 
do. Now, it’s like: If you have an idea, 
come to us and we’ll help you do what 
you want to do.”

West will have the opportunity to 
demonstrate her effectiveness in office 
right away, when the UC Board of 
Regents arrives at UCSD next month 
for a meeting where it is expected to 
raise systemwide tuition by as much as 
10 percent. 

“I definitely want to mobilize 
everyone to go to the regents meeting 
… show my face, tell people about the 

regents meeting that’s coming up, defi-
nitely have students’ presence there,” 
West said. 

VP Student Life candidate 
Stephanie Usry, who ran with the 
Clean Slate, said she is still committed 
to fulfilling her campaign promises 
despite her defeat. 

“I’ll still work for student involve-
ment, and maybe being outside of 
A.S. bureaucracy will be a good thing,” 
Usry said.  

Usry, who aimed to increase stu-
dent participation in the council’s pro-
ceedings, said she hopes the newly 
elected Hernandez will expand and 
improve upon the Student Life office.

“Broaden the horizons of the office,” 
she said, addressing Hernandez. “Don’t 
just focus on appointing the [associate 
vice presidents]. Make it’s something 
different from what it has been.”

Student Voice! fared well in the 
hotly contested campuswide senator 
race, claiming six out of eight senate 
seats with candidates Katie Hall, Wafa 
Ben Hassine, Bryant Pena, Desiree 
Prevo, Carli Thomas and Alex Vu. 

Clean Slate snagged the remaining 
two senate positions, seating Tobias 
Haglund and Adam Kenworthy.  

A total of 5,397 students cast 
their votes on TritonLink last week.  
Eleanor Roosevelt College boasted the 
highest voter turnout rate, at 27 per-
cent of its student body; Earl Warren 
College saw the lowest turnout rate at 
22 percent.

The student-fee referendum on the 
Sixth College ballot was passed by a 
margin of 63 votes, increasing the col-
lege’s quarterly activity fee by $3 and 
filling out the Sixth College Council 
coffers. A similar referendum on the 
John Muir College ballot was shot 
down by a margin of 89 votes.

tic that would limit debate on pro-
posed policies by allowing the passage 
of a budget by a simple majority vote, 
rather than the usual 60 votes needed 
to prevent a filibuster. 

“U.S.S.A. is supporting the House 
version of the budget because the 
House version increases the discre-
tionary spending by 3.5 percent, 
which goes to helping programs like 
TRIO and G.E.A.R.-U.P. [Gaining 
Early Awareness and Readiness for 
Undergraduate Programs], and other 
federal funded academic prepara-
tion programs,” said Clais Daniels-
Edwards, legislative director for the 
UC Student Association, which is 
affiliated with the U.S.S.A.

The House’s version of the bud-
get includes reconciliation, while the 
Senate’s version does not. If recon-
ciliation were included in the final-
ized federal budget, this contentious 
measure — labeled by Republicans 
as a heavy-handed tool used by 
majority Democrats to silence the 
minority — would expedite the pro-
cess of enacting spending and taxa-
tion legislation by preventing a fili-
buster by Senate Republicans.

“[Reconciliation] would create a $1 
billion savings by removing some of the 
government subsidized money to sup-
port FFEL lenders,” Daniels-Edwards 
said. “These savings would go to the 
Pell Grant, thus being able to increase 
the maximum award if possible, and 
make it available to more students.” 

Apart from these particular 
higher-education funding changes, 
Harrington said the budget is still in 
its early stages, and does not spell out 
allocations for most programs.

Recently I’ve noticed something strange: Jobs are disappearing, student fees are increasing and 
Perks has cut back its hours of opera-
tion. After some diligent research I 
discovered that it has to do with a 
little something that Wall Street hot-
shots like to call “the economy.” 

It’s unclear whether this economy 
is to blame for the death of my child-
hood dog, but it’s definitely the rea-
son I can’t afford double-quilted toilet 
paper. According to experts, it’s out 
of control and it’s not going to stop 
anytime soon. 

But don’t panic: You might not have 
to sacrifice your $300 handbag fetish 
quite yet. I’ve developed some strate-
gies to help you cut down the cost of 
boring necessities and up your cash 
flow so that you can continue purchas-
ing luxury items. After all, where else 
would you get your self-worth?  

1) Consider relaxing your hygien-
ic efforts. Most toiletries are quite 
pricey, so avoiding their everyday use 
is a great way to save cash. You can 
cut your toothpaste use, for example, 
to twice a week and save up to buy 
that leather-bound Moleskine journal 
you’ve been eyeing. Some may argue 
that poor hygienic practices might 
actually increase costs by requiring 
more doctor visits, but research in this 
particular area is inconclusive at best. 

2) Reassess your definition of 
“necessity.” You might not realize this, 
but we have been brainwashed into 
thinking certain items are indispens-
able when they are actually useless. 
Take socks for instance, or underwear 
— they are simply excess layers of cloth 
on your body that lack any real func-
tion. Sell these items to your friends 
and family and don’t buy new ones. 
Use your earnings to buy an expensive 
bottle of champagne and save it for 
textbook-buying season. After you’ve 
purchased a $200 book about fos-
sils, you can run home and drink the 
champagne. As it trickles through your 
system, you won’t feel so poor after all.

3) Go into crime. They don’t 
teach you this in college because it 
would throw off the natural balance 
of the world, but crime is an extreme-
ly lucrative business. Drug dealers 
can choose from many different types 
of substances — ranging from study-
friendly to recreational — and tar-
get a particular group of students to 
whom they can market their product 
(i.e. Adderall is to Geisel what pot is 
to the Student Center). If drugs aren’t 
your thing, try kidnapping a local ele-
mentary school kid (I’d recommend a 
La Jolla Country Day School student 
over a Preuss School one) and asking 
for a reasonable ransom. Just imagine 
all the late-night Alberto’s runs you 
could fund with cash like that.

Remember, the way you earn your 
income is nowhere near as important 
as the awesome stuff you can buy 
with it. After all, getting good jobs so 
we can buy cool stuff is the reason we 
all went to college in the first place. 
And if the current system is failing 
us, we must fight back. So go on, 
start stalking that elementary school 
student. It just might be the only way 
you can keep up with your comfort-
able college lifestyle.

By Utsav Gupta
A.S. President-Elect

My name is Utsav Gupta, and I am 
your next A.S. president. I ran for this 
position because I want to create a stu-
dent government that works for every 
student here at UCSD. Over the past 
few years, I have witnessed our student 
government become complacent on 
some of our most important issues. 

Many students don’t know exactly 
what their student government does. 
Often, the only time you see your 
representatives is when they’re asking 
for your vote come Spring Quarter. 
As your president, I hope to create an 
A.S. Council that is visible, smart, and 
works for your needs.

To this end, I promise several tangi-
ble benefits to your college experience, 
which are as follows: uncage Sun God 
and bring it back to the rest of UCSD, 
lobby against the $800 increase in 
tuition next year, support and expand 

our athletics programs and fight for 
our free-speech rights on campus.

These goals are ambitious, and 
some may take more than just my 
term to accomplish. However, unlike 
what the Guardian would have you 
believe, these goals are entirely pos-
sible. I believe that your A.S. Council 
has to work harder on multiyear goals, 
building an institutional memory that 
we can use to serve you. 

A good example is intercollegiate 
football. The survey that I placed on the 
ballot proves that a majority — over 70 
percent of the over 5,000 students who 
voted — would like to see a football 
team. Almost 65 percent of those who 
voted even say they would pay for it. 
In endorsing me, the Guardian called 
my hope for a team “farfetched” and 
“nauseatingly expensive.”

I think we’ve proven with our vote 
that the idea isn’t so farfetched. I’ve 
spoken to administrators about the 
issue, and each one has told me, “If the 

students want it, they can get it.” We’ve 
definitely proven that students want it. 

Now, we need to act on it. To 
accomplish these goals, we first need 
to create an A.S. Council that can actu-
ally work. This year has been marked 
by internal bickering, most of which 
comes from legislation proposed that 
only affects the council internally.

Our internal problems stem from 
a change to the A.S. constitution that 
“reset” the council’s institutional mem-
ory. Working relationships are poorly 
defined in our standing rules, and 
there’s a disconnect between the execu-
tives, the cabinet and the senate. 

I will unify the A.S. Council by pro-
viding a presidential focus on each and 
every position. I will meet with every 
councilmember and senator to really 
get a feel of how she or he is doing. I 
will redefine the scope of senator proj-
ects to allow us to focus on these larger, 
common goals as groups or teams. 

We also need to work harder 

externally. I will work with our next 
Vice President of Student Life Ricsie 
Hernandez to ensure we have adequate 
and trained representation from all 
campuswide committees. I will work 
to reach out personally to the student 
body, with a monthly YouTube address 
and a quarterly newsletter.

I’ll institute a Fall Quarter annual 
opinion survey with the same mindset 
as that of the football survey — to use 
as a tool that both the A.S. Council and 
the administration can use in advocat-
ing for your interests. I want to prove 
to you that your opinion matters, and 
that your representatives can be out 
there on Library Walk not only for 
your vote, but for your opinion.

I’m confident that if we work 
together as a unified student body, 
we can and will achieve our goals and 
truly make UCSD our campus.

A.S. COUNCIL — Amid the bick-
ering and bubbly self-promotion of 
last week’s A.S. election, one promise 
from nearly every candidate was clear: 
A.S. councilmembers want to increase 
their communication with the general 
student body.

Of course, we’ve heard it all before. 
Year after year, candidates recognize 
the huge disconnect between the aver-
age UCSD student and his or her stu-
dent government; year after year, can-
didates have pledged greater visibility 
and more direct interaction — only to 
shove that goal to the side once mid-
terms and 14-hour council meetings 
start popping up. 

Take our current A.S. President 
Donna Bean, for example. When she 
ran for vice president of student life 
in 2007, she said she would reach out 
to student organizations by personally 
attending their meetings in order to 
strengthen their input to the council. 
The next year, in her unopposed bid 
for A.S. president, Bean underscored 
the fact that students still lack power 
over their programs, events and stu-
dent life. Yet as her presidency nears an 
end, little has been done to reach out to 
the greater student body. Efforts have 
been stagnant, stopping at Facebook 
pages, posters and student forums — 
all of which require students to come 
to councilmembers.

Many ideas from this year’s can-
didates were similarly flawed. If done 
right, regularly updating the A.S. Web 
site, releasing YouTube addresses, 
distributing student surveys, writing 
newsletters and updating Facebook 
accounts would all be helpful steps 
toward a more connected student body 
— but these ideas must only be supple-
mentary to face-to-face interactions. 
The reality is that most UCSD students 
are too distracted with academic and 
social concerns to actually pay atten-
tion to the A.S. Council’s activities. 

Despite the $477,000 in student 
fees allocated by the A.S. Council to 
programming this year alone, a scanty 
24.3 percent of students voted in the 
election. This apathy is exactly why 
A.S. representatives must spend more 

time seeking out students’ opinions  in 
the form of a Library Walk info table, 
weekly visits to student organizations 
and regular contact with college coun-
cils. Still, new electees’ promises to 
A.S. visibility are missing something: 
the assurance that, once the year starts 
rolling, this priority won’t be thrown 
to the curb.

That’s why next year’s coun-
cil should create a student volunteer 
group whose sole responsibility would 
be to gather student input. If they’re 
promising a stronger A.S. presence 
on Library Walk, they could create a 
weekly schedule and assign slots to 
ensure someone will always be outside 
tabling. Individual volunteers could be 
assigned to different locations around 
campus (like dining halls or Geisel) 
and establish a relationship with stu-
dents who hang out in their assigned 

areas. The students could be respon-
sible for writing feedback reports every 
two weeks so the entire council can 
stay informed on the undergraduate 
population’s concerns.

Councilmembers who want to 
move forward with other technology-
based ideas should assign specific indi-
viduals to keep tabs on those avenues 
of communication, too. Between Feb. 
23 and April 9, the only two posts on 
the A.S. Facebook page pertained to 
the elections. There was no mention of 
happenings in the university’s speech 
policy committee, the Literature 
Building cancer cluster or changes in 
the council’s standing rules, despite the 
significant council time spent on each. 
Even more alarming is how few stu-
dents check the page in the first place. 
If it were one person’s job to recruit 
fans, facilitate discussions or post 

weekly summaries of council meet-
ings, avenues like Facebook wouldn’t 
remain widely ignored. If online net-
working is something candidates are 
banking on for increased student com-
munication, it should be used right.

The average college student is sleep 
deprived and stressed out, and hardly 
wants to learn about his or her major, 
let alone campus politics. Nonetheless, 
next year’s councilmembers must aban-
don the comfortable “if you build it 
they will come” attitude and start seek-
ing out student input. Constructing a 
system of student outreach within the 
council infrastructure might not neces-
sarily mean every student’s voice will be 
heard, but it’s a sure step to widening 
the council’s listening range.

Dear Editor,
Just before leaving office, the 

Bush administration eviscerated the 
central consultation process of the 
Endangered Species Act — exempt-
ing greenhouse gas-emitting projects 
from regulation — and banned fed-
eral agencies from protecting the polar 
bear from greenhouse gas emissions, 
the primary threat to its continued 
existence. These rules gut our nation’s 
most important wildlife protection law, 
and we’ve failed to use this law to fight 

the greatest future threat to endan-
gered species — global warming.

On March 11, President Barack 
Obama signed into law an appro-
priations bill giving Secretary of the 
Interior Ken Salazar 60 days to rescind 
the Bush rules with the stroke of a pen 
and restore the Endangered Species 
Act to its former glory. As global citi-
zens, we must urge Salazar to do what 
is right and take the first steps in 
repairing the environmental damage 
of the Bush administration by imme-
diately rescinding the Endangered 
Species Act regulations by May 9. Call 
Salazar today at (202) 208-7351 and go 
to Savethepolarbear.org to send him 

a letter. The survival of endangered 
species across the planet depends on it.

I
t’s official: Cockroaches never die. 

On December 6, 2008, a team of under-
graduates launched 20 of the household pests 
into space. Upon returning to Earth, every one 
of them had survived the voyage, withstanding 

temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees, as well as 
the radiation and matter-less conditions in space.

The flight test was one of two hands-on design 
projects assigned last Fall Quarter in MAE 2 — an 
introductory course to aerospace engineering — by 
professors John Kosmatka and Keiko Nomura.

Every year, Kosmatka and Nomura include a 
technical design project on the course syllabus. 
Typically, it involves building small airplanes and 
flying them at campus locations such as RIMAC 
Field. But this year, Kosmatka and Nomura decided 
to include an additional project that would cater 
more to students’ interests.

“There are about 120 students in this course, 
and a third of them are more interested in space 
than aircraft,” Kosmatka said.

The class, a prerequisite for the aerospace engi-
neering major, is largely composed of freshmen. 
While a lot of work is required for the new assign-
ment, Kosmatka said the project was designed to 
press students into questioning their commitment 
to the field.

“It’s a hard major, and we really want them to 
become motivated as freshmen,” Kosmatka said. “If 
they are inspired, then they are on the right track.”

Kosmatka and Nomura said they gave students 
as much freedom as possible to design and study 
what they wanted within the project guidelines.

“I’m sure they were tired of me telling them 
what I thought was going on,” Kosmatka said. “I 
wanted them to figure out for themselves what was 
happening.”

Teaching assistants Andrew Cavendar and Zach 
Lovering also helped orchestrate the launch.

The faculty applied for sponsorship from the 
California Space Grant, which covered the total 
cost of the project — approximately $5,000. They 
also contacted the Federal Aviation Administration 
to make sure the project was within the FAA’s legal 
airspace limits.

The 40-foot balloon contraption was composed 
of a series of four payloads, or boxes, each with a 
different function. The compartment at the lowest 
level contained two cameras with software rewritten 
by students to take photographs every 30 seconds, 
from both horizontal and vertical perspectives. The 
boxes were tethered to a large atmospheric weather 
balloon, 10 feet in diameter, with a deflated para-
chute dangling just beneath it. 

As the balloon reached 85,000 feet — considered 
the edge of space — it expanded and eventually 
burst, at which point the parachute opened and 
gently brought the apparatus back down to the 
earth. The entire trip lasted two hours.

The 22 students selected for this project — cho-
sen from a class of 113 based on interest and past 
experience in ballooning, electronics fabrication,

GATHERING DATA
Sensors measured 
pressure, temperature, 
humidity, wind velocity, 
time, radiation, mag-
netic fi eld and solar-cell 
effi  ciency in relation to 
the balloon’s altitude.

VIEW FROM ABOVE
Horizontal and 
vertical digital cameras, 
set to continuously
shoot at 30-second inter-
vals, captured the balloon’s 
journey to space and
back.

THE SURVIVORS
Cockroaches, water bears and pla-
naria (small worms) were sent up 

in special environmental cham-
bers. All cockroaches survived the  
minus 40 degree temperature and 

environmental rigors of space.

METHOD ACTING
Above: Eleven min-
utes into the experi-
ment, an infected cell 
(green) has attached 
itself to an
uninfected cell.
Below: At 29 min-
utes, the infection 
has spread to the new 
cell, and has already 
begun to take over 
the cell’s functions.

SETTING THE STAGE
Infected and 
uninfected cells are 
loaded into a live cell 
imaging chamber 
(clear tubes), then 
transferred onto 
the microscope and 
imaged with rapid, 
spinning-disk confo-
cal microscopy.

T hough it looks more like a radioactive piece of Flubber slowly forcing itself into some unsuspecting globular struc-ture, a new 37-second film clip — captured by researchers 
at UC Davis and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine — shows 
an HIV-infected T-cell spreading the virus to an uninfected 
T-cell. 

The footage proves that the process occurs through a viro-
logical synapse: a cell-to-cell adhesion that allows the virus to 
transfer without leaving the safety of cell membranes. 

A March 6 article in Science magazine challenged academics, 
industry specialists, patient advocates and government officials 
to cooperate in the search for a vaccine for the global killer; the 
video footage’s resulting report ran in the same publication on 
March 27.

When screened at an HIV conference this summer, the 
transfer elicited “audible gasps” from the audience, said Thomas 
Huser, associate professor and chief scientist at the UC Davis 
Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology.

“The filming of live cells was important because it allowed 
us to make very specific physical measurements with regard to 
the rate of transfer of viral proteins in the already infected cell, 
as well as in the newly infected target cells,” Huser said. “This 
enables us to make more definitive conclusions about the nature 
of the virus transfer. It allows others to develop better models of 
the pathway of cell-cell transmission, and, of course, it created 
some stunning visual imagery, which should be eye opening to 
scientists and the wider public alike.”

Highly active antiretroviral therapy — the current go-to 
drug cocktail designed to halt HIV replication — still has 
significant drawbacks. It is an expensive, lifelong prescription 
with long-term side effects in older HIV-positive patients that 
can include certain types of cancer, heart disease, liver disease 
and diabetes. 

Like Huser, many researchers believe that HIV treatments 
have reached a point where it is necessary to put treatment 
research on the back burner in favor of discovering a vaccine.

“Clearly one of the highest priorities of AIDS research, in 
addition to finding a cure, is to find an effective preventive 
vaccine,” said Benjamin Chen, assistant professor at the Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine. Chen’s laboratory created the green 
fluorescent virus technology, like a food coloring for cells, used 
to illuminate the cell-to-cell transfer in the video.

Chen noted that the new evidence may assist researchers in 
creating an effective HIV vaccine, by emphasizing the need for 
antibodies that attack both modes of transmission — cell-to-
cell along with the previously accepted cell-free transmission 
through plasma. 

UCSD professor of pathology and medicine Douglas 
Richman — who also serves as director of the Center for 
AIDS Research at UCSD — said the goal of current HIV/AIDS 
research is to reduce the need for chronic suppressive therapy 
by eliminating the latent reservoir of HIV infection, the pool of 
infection that remains dormant. However, this would demand 
additional knowledge of possibly undiscovered HIV “reser-
voirs,” as well as a greater understanding of HIV activities in 
the bloodstream. 

According to Chen the next goal is discovering how to stop 
the virus from spreading by using synapses, as well as develop-
ment of a method to help the immune system produce signifi-
cant amounts of HIV-blocking antibodies.

“We hope that this work will trigger significantly more 
work on the importance of direct cell-cell transmission for 
HIV, because we believe that this could be one of the rea-
sons why current attempts at developing a vaccine have been 
unsuccessful because the virus in essence hides inside cells,” 
Huser said.

But shortages in research funding from the federal govern-
ment, coupled with a need for a full-time virologist — currently 
compensated for by Chen’s research group — might slow prog-
ress. Other problems include the skeptical response of the HIV 
research community and the pharmaceutical industry.

Huser also realizes the problems researchers are faced with in 
attempts to cure the disease. 

“There are still many mysteries surrounding HIV spread,” 
Huser said. “We don’t know if spread through direct cell-cell 
transfer is really the dominant mode for how the infection 
spreads in the body. At the current point, we can only hypoth-
esize that it is. There is also a big mystery surrounding the actual 
infection of target cells. We found that the virus in the target cell 
appears to be contained in a cellular compartment, similar to an 
endosome. We currently have no clue about how HIV is able to 
get out of this compartment.” 

Scientists are still not overly optimistic when it comes to 
the future of HIV/AIDS research and vaccine discovery; they 
acknowledge several problems that hinder progress. One is 
time. Some, like Richman, believe that given the length of time 
required to complete other treatments, the process will be a 
tedious and slow-moving one that may not produce results for 
years, if not decades. 

“This virus is different from almost any other virus,” Richman 
said. “There is so much antigenic variation that it will be difficult 
to create a vaccine for this. It’s going to be a long, hard struggle.”

and hands-on building — divided 
themselves into six teams, each 
focusing on a different task. 

One team focused entirely on 
sending the weather balloon astro-
nauts — cockroaches, planaria 
(small worms) and tardigrade, 
commonly known as water bears 
— into space. They wanted to test 
the creatures’ ability to cope with 
environmental stressors at extreme 
altitudes. 

The students tested the resistance 
of each species by placing them in a 
capsule with a variation of environ-
mental constraints: Some chambers 
included heaters or air-activated 
hand warmers to compensate for 
subzero temperatures, while others 
were equipped with oxygen.

Another task force measured 
wind speed, humidity, pressure and 
temperature with altitude. One of 
the goals of this task force was to 
see whether solar-powered airplanes 
flown at each altitude the balloon 
reached could be a viable option in 
the future, Kosmatka said.

This group was also in charge 
of predicting where the apparatus 
would be able to land — given wind 
speed, extreme weather and other 
environmental factors — while 
avoiding the Salton Sea, U.S. military 
territory and the Mexican desert. 

Fortunately, the balloon landed 

in the Imperial Sand Dunes — about 
65 miles east of the launch.

According to Thurgood Marshall 
College junior Casey Barrett, who 
was part of the team responsible for 
pre-testing the integrity of the con-
tainers for space flight and landing, 
most of the six-week project was 
completed outside of class. Much of 
her team’s work was crammed into 
the week preceding the launch. 

“[We] had to wait until all of the 
other teams figured out what they 
wanted to test and how they wanted 
to do it,” Barrett said. “Then we had 
to design the structure and build the 
boxes. We had to work with every-
one … It’s a lot of work, but it was a 
lot of fun as well. It was so rewarding 
to let go of the balloon.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
David Hernandez-Ibarra said the 
project was unlike any other he has 
been assigned. 

“This was a trial project, but I 
really hope [the professors] try it 
again in the future,” he said. 

The balloon apparatus will be 
reconstructed and exhibited in Price 
Center East for a month during 
Spring Quarter, with the parachute 
open above the payload boxes to 
symbolize the descent — and success 
— of the project.

Friendly Fires - In the vein of funky white guys 
like Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem, these British

track with peppy hooks, gushy New Romantic 
choruses and Talking Heads-style nerd funk. From 
the outside, they're buzzy, club-ready jams, but 
singer Ed MacFarlane sounds more like a softy than 
a player — he wants to cuddle you, not freak you.

to end the third. 
UCSD could not retain the momen-

tum from its third-quarter surge, giv-
ing up three unanswered goals to the 
Wolverines to start the final period. 
With the game well out of reach, 
Gstettenbauer scored the final UCSD 
goal, making the final score 10-6.

On Thursday night, the Tritons 
faced rival Loyola Marymount 
University; UCSD defeated the Lions 
decisively at their home pool on the 
Lions’ Senior Day last year.

“That’s my fondest memory of this 
team,” Gstettenbauer said. “They were 
so cocky going into that game and then 
we beat them pretty good.”

Despite the strong performance in 

last year’s match, the Tritons knew that 
this game would be a new fight.

UCSD came out blazing, tak-
ing a 4-1 lead after the first quarter. 
Gstettenbauer and junior two-meter 
Stephanie Heinrich scored back-to-
back goals in the opening minutes. 
The Lions scored three unanswered 
goals in the second quarter to tie the 
game. The lapse woke up the Tritons’ 
top performers — Gstettenbauer and 
Heinrich — who took over the come-
back attempt, quickly scoring twice. 
A controversial LMU buzzer beater 
cut UCSD’s lead to one at the end of 
the half.

To break out of the second half, 
both teams fought hard before LMU 
netted consecutive goals to take the 

8-7 lead. But Bloom scored her second 
goal of the quarter to tie the game. 
UCSD struck first in the final period; 
Heinrich scored her fourth goal of 
the game. But the Lions returned with 
three straight goals to take the lead and 
finish the game 11-9. 

“We have a really young team,” 
Sanders said. “They pass well, but they 
need to learn when to take the open 
shot ... and that’s just going to come 
with more experience.”

UCSD prepares to face Chapman 
University on April 17 before traveling 
to San Diego State University in hopes 
of avenging a previous 16-6 loss.

Featuring

pitcher Lauren Chastain’s first home 
run of the season — a three-run shot.

“I think we were just seeing the ball 
really well,” Habib said. “Obviously it 
showed in our hitting.”

The Coyotes responded with a 
three-run blast of their own in the 
second, making the score 4-3.

With UCSD up 6-3 in the fifth, the 
Coyotes scored twice, cutting the Triton 
lead to one. However, UCSD continued 
to hit the long ball, and Habib’s tower-
ing home run in the bottom of the fifth 
gave the Tritons a 7-5 lead.

Down by two, the Coyotes scored 
a run in the sixth, and threatened to 
take the lead with two runners on base. 
Granath came in from the bullpen to 
extinguish the fire, by striking out the 
next batter and inducing a groundout 
before pitching a flawless seventh.

“It’s where I want to be all the time 
— the crisis situations are always the 
best,” Granath said. “And when good 
things happen it’s even better.”

Unfortunately, UCSD came up 

short in the second game of the dou-
bleheader. The Coyotes took a 4-0 
lead through three-and-a-half innings 
before junior catcher Nicole Saari’s two-
run single helped cut the deficit to one.

UCSD rallied in the seventh as 
senior outfielder Megan Grace smashed 
an RBI triple, making it 7-5. Sophomore 
catcher Nicole Monroe hustled to first 
base for an RBI single, but UCSD was 
unable to finish the rally.

“We lost from poor defensive play,” 
Gerckens said. “Our infield just didn’t 
get some routine ground balls, didn’t 
communicate on some pop flies, did 
not take the bunt away from them.”

During the first game of the Senior 
Day doubleheader on April 11, the 
UCSD lineup left nine runners on 
base. The offensive struggles peaked in 
the fifth inning, with the team down 
5-1. The Tritons loaded the bases, but 
didn’t bring anyone home.

“We all want to be in those situa-
tions and we all want to come out big 
for our team,” assistant coach Bridget 
McKay said. “Sometimes the balls just 

don’t fall and you just don’t get the hits.”
The UCSD pitching gave up 11 hits 

in the 7-1 Coyote victory.
In the doubleheader’s back end, the 

Tritons mustered only three hits, fail-
ing to score and falling 2-0 to Cal State 
San Bernardino.

Chastain, who leads all Triton 
pitchers in wins and strikeouts, kept 
UCSD in the game, allowing only two 
runs through seven innings. With the 
Coyotes up 1-0 in the sixth, Chastain 
stranded two runners with a critical 
strikeout to escape the inning.

“I was hoping that we could use 
the momentum and take it into the 
seventh and score a couple of runs to 
win the game,” Chastain said.

After the disappointing series, 
UCSD is now fourth in the CCAA 
and must hold on to that fourth spot 
to make the playoffs. UCSD’s next 
series is against second-place Cal State 
Dominguez Hills April 17 and 18.

VOLLEYBALL — On the verge of playoff elimina-
tion, No. 10 UCSD (12-14, 8-13 Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation) had a rollercoaster weekend at 
RIMAC Arena against No. 3 Cal State Northridge 
and No. 13 UC Santa Barbara. The Tritons nearly 
forced a fifth set on April 10, before falling in four 
to the Matadors. UCSD then defeated UCSB on 
April 11 in five sets, keeping playoff hopes alive.

“With CSUN we stayed down for a little 
too long, but we came back against UCSB and 
finished strong,” senior middle blocker Gerald 
Houseman said.

After Friday’s loss to the Matadors, the Tritons 
found themselves in a must-win situation on 
Saturday against UCSB (8-18, 4-17 MPSF) with 
UCSD’s first-ever postseason berth on the line. 
Playing most of Saturday’s game from behind, 
the Tritons eventually overcame the early deficit, 
taking the five-set victory.

UCSD won the first set, hitting at a .423 clip 
compared to the Gauchos’ .148. Holding on to a 
slim lead, the Tritons widened their advantage 
margin to 24-20 on the backs of Fritsch and 
Houseman, leading to a 30-26 win.

After a kill from junior opposite hitter Jason 
Spangler opened the second set, the Gauchos 
went on a scoring spree, sending down 10 straight 
points and ultimately taking the set 30-21.

The third set wasn’t much of an improvement 
for the Tritons, as they were coming off a set in 
which they hit for a negative percentage. After 
trailing by five early on, UCSD rallied to come 
within two points. However, UCSB went on an 8-3 
run, putting the set out of reach for the Tritons.

UCSD finally showed life in set four, when a 
block from Houseman and sophomore setter Phil 
Bannan combined with two Fritsch kills broke a 
tie and gave the Tritons a 24-20 lead. UCSD forced 
a fifth set after redshirt sophomore outside hitter 
Will Ehrman sent down the match point.

The Tritons took an 8-6 lead in the fifth set 
after a service error before the Gauchos stormed 
back, tying the score at 11. A UCSD attack error 
gave the Gauchos a 12-11 lead, but the Tritons 
immediately answered on a Fritsch kill to tie it 
at 12 before a UCSB attack error put the Tritons 

back on top. UCSB tied it again at 13, but another 
Gaucho attack error and an Ehrman kill ended 
the game and match at a 15-13 UCSD advantage.

“The UCSB game was kind of up and down 
for us playing wise, but we were able to turn 
it around in the fourth and fifth game when it 
counted and came out with the win,” Bannan said.

Fritsch led the Tritons with 21 kills, while 
Ehrman added 16 kills and 10 digs. Sophomore 
middle blocker Calvin Ross and Houseman 
added nine kills each. Houseman and Ross had 
eight blocks apiece while Phil Bannan recorded 
seven blocks, six digs and 56 assists.

Friday night, the Tritons gave the Cal State 
Northridge Matadors (22-5, 15-5 MPSF) a battle 

to remember on their home court. In the game, 
the Tritons were barely outhit: .276 to .261. 
Fritsch sent down 26 kills and Spangler added 22 
kills as UCSD nearly forced a fifth set. The fourth 
set featured 21 ties and 10 lead changes. 

After taking the first set, Cal State Northridge 
carried an early 10-8 lead in the second.

UCSD then went on an 11-4 tear, making 
the score 19-14. With a tied score at 28, Cal 
State Northridge took the lead on a kill. Spangler 
answered back with a kill of his own and two Cal 
State Northridge errors gave UCSD the win.

Cal State Northridge dominated the third set 
early before the Tritons rallied to cut the deficit 
to two. The Matadors quickly fenced off UCSD, 

closing the door on the set with a 10-4 run.
In the seesaw grudge match that was the 

fourth set, both teams served for the win; it was a 
never-ending story, going back and forth multiple 
times. Following a UCSD service error, a Matador 
block finally ended the match at 38-36.

The Tritons will play again on Friday night at 
RIMAC against Cal State Long Beach.

“I think we might have a chance still to make 
playoffs depending on how other teams finish 
up their seasons,” Bannan said. “So we will have 
to wait and see how that turns out.”

WATER POLO — With the season 
winding down, the Tritons, who played 
their final home game and faced their 
archrival in back-to-back contests last 
week, would have preferred a hap-
pier finish. In an outstanding matchup 
against No. 11 Loyola Marymount 
University on April 9, the Tritons fell 
short of an upset by just four and a 
half minutes. UCSD then faced No. 13 
University of Michigan on Senior Day, 
aggressively attacking the Wolverines 
throughout the match before Michigan 
snagged the victory in the fourth quar-
ter.

Throughout the season, the Tritons 
have battled through inexperience at 
key positions, but on Saturday UCSD’s 
veteran players were faced with the 
task of dealing with strong emotions. 

“It feels weird,” senior captain 
Sydney Gstettenbauer said of her final 
home game. “It doesn’t really feel like 
I’m leaving. We still have some games 
left so it’s not like it’s really over yet.”

The Wolverines relentlessly shut 
down Gstettenbauer, who has been 
UCSD’s top performer this season. The 
attacker scored her only goal of the 
game in its closing seconds — long 
after the outcome had been decided.

Both teams played a tight game 
through much of the contest; a per-
formance lapse in the second quarter 
was the Tritons’ undoing. From the get 
go, the game looked to be a defensive 
matchup, with neither offense clicking 
in the first quarter. The University of 
Michigan finally scored with 1:51 left 
in the first on a shot that just barely 
crawled through the posts. Sophomore 
utility Nadine Shnayderman returned 
the favor, scoring a Triton goal with 40 

seconds left in the quarter. 
Both teams scored back-to-back 

goals to start the second period before 
Michigan went on a four-goal run, tak-
ing a 6-2 halftime lead.

“When they take out our best 
scorer, the other players need to find 
opportunities to make shots,” head 
coach Larry Sanders said. “The open-
ings are there because the defense 
is focusing on [Gstettenbauer] and 

someone needs to find that open shot.”
The Tritons took that advice to 

heart in the third quarter, netting the 
first two goals — by senior two-meter 
defender Rebecca Gearty and junior 
attacker Audra Bloom — and cutting 
the Michigan lead to 6-4. Michigan 
scored again, but sophomore attacker 
Hanalei Crowell answered with a goal

SOFTBALL — UCSD dropped four 
out of five games last week, in its last 
homestand of the season. Now, the 
Tritons must hold on to fourth place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association to make the playoffs.

Having won eight of their last 11 
games, the Tritons looked more than 
ready for their final five home games 
against University of San Diego on 
April 8, and doubleheaders against Cal 
State San Bernardino April 10 and 11. 

UCSD got off to a rough start, with 
USD taking a 5-0 lead during the top 
of the first inning. Freshman start-
ing pitcher Tess Granath gave up four 
hits and the Triton defense committed 

three errors in the first inning.
“We definitely changed a lot of peo-

ple around in the lineup,” head coach 
Patti Gerckens said. “Our catcher 
[against USD] usually plays first base.”

After sophomore outfielder Kristyn 
Lesovsky hit an RBI single in the fifth, 
USD struck back with a three-run 
home run, taking an 8-1 lead.

Down by seven, the Tritons rallied 
in the seventh inning, but were only 
able to put four runs on the score-
board, ultimately falling 8-5. 

After the loss, UCSD set its sights 
on its final home series of the season, a 
four-game set with the Coyotes.

UCSD struck first, producing four 
runs on three hits, including senior
