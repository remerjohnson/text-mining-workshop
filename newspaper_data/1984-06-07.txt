The AS has had a busy, if Controvers ial, year. Issues raised underthe Craig Lee 
administration have, in some cases, pursued the new AS president, Marc "Boris" 
Boroditsky into office. 

The battles began last summer when a special meeting was held to discuss the 
alloca tion of funds to KSDT Radio and The Birdcage Review. KSDT was allocated 
$12,500, an amount which was subsequently vetoed. A move to override the 
veto, on the grounds that Karyn King, the station's program director, said that 
$15 ,000 was needed to operate the station effectively. failed . Instead of the 
$15 ,000 requested, KSDT was granted $10,000. at a time when the station had 
its first chance in i5 years at getting an FCC radio band. King responded 
bitterly with a theme that was echoed several times during the year: "It's time 
that the student government stop usmg school organizations as political 
footballs." 

[n the same meetlng that raised KSDTs war banner, an $8,000 budget request 
by The Birdcage Review was met with a $6,000 budget that was also vetoed by Lee. 
The student body president proposed a $4,000 compromise. 

A boycott of Coors products, because of alleged sexual and racial policies of 
the company, was declared by the AS three years before the start of this school 
year. After much debate and an all-expenses-paid tour of the Colorado plant for 
three AS members, the Council voted to lift the boycott. The boycott was barely 
lifted, with one VOle prOViding the necessary two-thirds majority. Said Revelle 
Representative Audrey Thompson, "1 talked to more than 20 of my constituents, 
and more than three-quaners of them wanted Coors on campus and that's what 
I'm here for ." 

External Affairs Commissioner Lisa Stenmark commented on the anti-Coors 
position with a recollection of her trip to the Coors plant, "We were walking 
along and Greg Hemperly said, There's a black woman - we gOt to go talk to 
her.' The woman said , 'I knew this guy who was promoted to supervisor, 
demoted, promoted and demoted again. He was black and he is suing Coors 
now for discrimination.'" 

In November, Commissioner of Communications Tim Pickwell introduced a 
bill to combine the new indicator, La VOz FronteliZa, L'Chayirn, Sappho Speaks and 
The People's Voice into one publication , at a potential savings 0[$20,000. The bill 
caused an immedIate uproar from the alternative media who had already been 
insulted by a new typesetting policy introduced by Pickwell which resulted in 
workers who were hired by him, allegedly not trained over summer as promised. 
(In one dispute caused by the typesetting policy, editors of two of the 
publications ended up in a fist fight.) While the AS defended a need for "fiscal 
responsibility" the media claimed that the student government was only 
interested in "getting across their own extreme right ideas ... and insulating 
themselves from the rest of the student body," out of an interest in the Council's 
individual careers. 

The Council came up with a well-intentioned, but sadly unsuccessful 
fundraising project, in the fonn of "Men of UCSD" and "Women of UCSD" 
calendars. Six thousand of the calendars were produced (4,000 "Men of' and 
2,000 "Women of"), but ocly a thousand were sold ata loss of more than $5,000. 

The AS elections replaced the former Council, almost entirely with people 
running on the AS Express slate. Marc Boroditsky, the President-elect, was 
previously appointed to the Council in a position that was essentially created 
for him. 

The election referenda provided some hot debate, panicularly the alternative 
media cutS and the all-campus housing bills. All referenda were voted down by a 
small percentage. 

Two weeks after the issue was initially voted down, a "lame duck" session of 
the Council voted in stipends for the next administration. The bill was voted 
down several times in past years and failed once in a student referendum, but 
the Council, clad in togas, beer in hand, voted in the stipends nevenheless. "A 
vote against stipends is a vote for elitism and incompetence," said Lobby Annex 
Director Jeff Meyers. "We probably have a history of the most incompetent AS in 

, the UC system ... they lother UCs I all work on a stipend system, and they are all 
taken much more seriously." 

Not everything the AS did was surrounded by controversy. Two AS-directed 
projects came off as resounding success stories: the All Campus Semi-Formal 
and the Sun God Festival. 

With the attendance far exceeding the expected turnout of 1,500, the Sun 
God Festival provided games, food and entertainment, but more important to 
some was the sense of campus unity that it created. Perhaps the most popular 
feature of the Sun God Festival was the free beer.

UC sex segregation study 
called worthless by AFSCME 

com plicated - nOt only is the problem 
one of sex segregation , it is one of 
ranking all jobs, including ones with 
concentrations of specific groups of 
individuals. 

Wilson stated that the systemWide 
decision-making body "has been 
convinced to put this item on the 
highest priority. Work is presently 
underway and will continue." She also 
said she is "personally committed to 
correct problems wherever we find 
them." By KRISTIN DONNAN 

Once again there exists a difference 
of perspective between the union 
representing UC employees and UC 
policy makers. This time the subject is 
sex segregation. the so-called 
"comparable worth" of jobs which are 
either male- or female-dominated . 

In April , 1984, UC issued a study on 
the subject, which AFSCME (Amencan 
Federation of State , County and 
Municipal Employees) asserts is 
"worthless." To prove the pOint, 
AFSCME may be willing to sue to ensure 
that another study is completed . 

Stated simply, the UC has 
a knowledged problems in pay equity 

and says it wants to improve the 
situation by reviewing job classifications 
and revamping the existing system, 
according to Employment and 
Compensation of Women at the University 
of California , a recent report to the 
Legislature on comparable wonh . 
Instead of scrapping the whole present 
classification system and stani ng from 
s ratch . the report says that an 
improvement of the old one will be 
more reasonable. Quelda Wilson, 
assistant vice chancellor for personnel at 
UCSD. said that the approach to this 
begins with "attacking specific problem 
areas where there are concentrations of 

Date Rape: 
immoral, but illegal? 
By ETHAN FEERST 

Rape is forced sexual intercourse -
intercourse without mutual consent. 
According to FBI estimates, a rape 
occurs in this country every four 
min utes. Additional estimates indicate 
that at least half. and as many as 75% of 
rape victims are acquainted with their 
assailants. As young people between 
ages 15 and 24 constitute the majority 
of "date rape" victims, this is an issue of 
particular concern to college camruses. 

Yet this most prevalent form 0 rape 
is also the most difficult to define 
legally, morally and psychologically. 
According to Mary Weir of the UCSD 
Women's Resource Center, most women 
do not realize that they have been 
raped . "They just think they haven't said 
'no' loud enough," says Weir, who 
stressed that only 10%, at most, of all 
rapes are reported. 

The deeper problem, says the 
Women's Center's Lisa Stenmark, is that 
" ... date rape is rapped up in the roles 
that men and women play." Men think 
that they're supposed to want to; they 
think they can't take "no" for an answer. 
They fed that they've earned the right 
(or rite) of sexual intercourse after the 
woman has agreed to date . 

In its most subtle form, rape is a form 
of psychological pressure and 
dominance. Cliche tactics such as "You 
would if you loved me" or "I've heard 
you put out for other guys" act as a 
double-barreled assalut on the woman. 
What she hears, she hears from a 
[riend, an acquaintance, perhaps 
someone she is attracted to. [n addition, 

she hears social norms that still exist -
that are all too familiar - that ultimately 
confuse her sense of what she really 
wants to do. 

Ar its most extreme, a woman will 
date a Jekyll-and-Hyde, a gent who will 
undergo a sudden and violent 
transformation . These are the cases 
where actual physical force is used. The 
objective here is domination, not 
satisfaction. And because a date is the 
conventional medium through which 
men and women develop relationships, 
date rape is the most psychologically 
damaging beause it establishes a pattern 
for these relationships. 

Legally, date rape cases are the most 
wrought with problems. According to 
UCSD Legal Services' Mary Virga, "The 
woman doesn't want to come forward if 
she knows the man. She's afraid that 
people will think she asked for it." If the 
woman does come forward, she has 
lime chance of a conviction without 
supporting evidence, such as injuries to 
herself that indicate a struggle took 
place. Without such evidence, it 
becomes a case of the man's word 
against the woman's. 

Virga stresses, however, that the law 
enforcement agencies, particularly in 
San Diego, are becoming more 
sympathetic to the issue. As coordinator 
of the Rape Prevention and Education 
Program to be initiated on campus next 
year, Virga urges both men and women 
attend the program's various seminars 
and to educate themselves on the issues 
surrounding rape.

one sex." She feels, ·We can't very well 
do it all at one time." 

On the other hand , AFSCME asserts 
that a complete overhaul. including 
discontinuing the present system, is 
necessary for a legitimate Job evaluation. 
Tony Corbo, AFSCME's assistant area 
director for California, said that the job 
can be done in one fell swoop and that 
the method UC has taken is "a band-
aid approach." 

The siruation recoglllzed by both the 
UC report and AFSCME is that there 
exist job classifications in which 
concentrations of men or women 
appear. The controversy lies in the 
methods of deciding relative "worth," 
usually composed of hiring 
qualifications, responsibility , duties and 
supervision. 

Wilson explained that "each job must 
be evaluated and pegged into the system 
relative to the others." For the UC 
system's 830 job c1assiftcations, "This is 
not an easy job and it takes some time." 

Not only is the task a large one, but 
those who make the decisions must 
assume the responsibility of judging the 
relative job classifications and pay plans. 
According to the study, "There is no 
known method for measuring the 
objective 'worth' of jobs"; such concepts 
are "inherently subjective ." In this light, 
then, the topic seems to become very 

Corbo, conversely, feels that "internal 
as well as external equity is the only way 
to eliminate sex discrimination ." He 
said that perpetuating a "42-year-old, 
antiquated system is wrong and will not 
work." Corbo stated that in July of 1983 
the same commillee which sub milled 
the comparable worth study reported 
that it "ought to revamp the entire 
classification and pay plan." He 
Interprets that as starting from the 
beginning again, and he sees the 
statement as a contradiction to the 
report's most recent conclus ion that "no 
new policy is needed." 

Corbo said that this change of 
pOSition results from the committee's 
heing complised of "top level managers , 
no regular employees: which made for 
a "malleable committee." 

Though both groups recognize 
problems with the current job 
classification system, they obviously 
view the possible solutions differently. 
This originates from their respective 
views of the origins of the situation . 
Wilson believes that for various reasons, 
concentrations of women have been 
introduced into _speci fic job categories. 
She thinks that "encouraging women 
into higher job classifications" will aid 
in more even sex distribution. 

Indeed , the study states that "the 
long-term solution to such problems of

Physics award to 
commemorate Dr. Ma 

Professor Norman Kroll , chairman of 
the Physics Depanmem, has announced 
the selection of the first reCipient of the 
Shang-keng Ma Memorial Award. This 
award was established recently in 
memory of Professor Shang-keng Ma 
who passed away in November, 1983. 

Professor Ma became a member of the 
faculty of the Department of Physics in 
1967. He soon proceeded to establish 
himself as ~ leading figure in a wide 
spectrum of problems in condensed 
malter theory. His scientific 
accomplishments were truly outstanding 
and characterized by a unique style of 
blending numerical attacks on simple 
models with analytical techniques so as 
to get at and into these important 
problems. He was in the vanguard of 
the important rethinking of statisti al 
mechanics and completed a monograph 
on critical phenomena which has been 
invaluable to a generation of theorists in 

many fields. He was an active and 
dedicated panicipant in the teaching of 
upper division and graduate studies as 
well as in departmental affairs. 

While he was an undergraduate at 
UC Berkeley, Ma's prodigious talents 
were formally recognized by his being 
awarded the Berkeley Physics 
Department Citation as the most 
promising member of his senior class. 
In seeking to establish a fitting memorial 
for him at UCSD following his death in 
1983, the department founded the 
Shang-keng Ma Memorial Award to 
recognize an outstanding graduating 
UCSD physics senior who, in the 
judgment of the faculty, has exhibited 
high potential for pursuing a 
distinguished scientific career. 

The first award will be presented to a 
graduating PhYSics senior at 
commencement ceremonies on June 17 , 
1984.

arrangements don 't affect the

Sl k, vIolent attltudes whIch 
pervade our sOClet)' 

In basIC and cruelly honest 
language, although we dress 
ourselves up mcely as 
sophIsticated men and women 
and speak the pIOUS platitudes of 
CIvilized formali t)" underneath 
this thin veneer lurks a paek of 
savage beasts who hve by the law 
of the jungle. 

We march for peace. holding 
hands in human chai ns to 
symbolize the linking together of 
the human race. We sing wistful 
songs that express the dreamy 
Vlsion of a world united - a 
vision that would become reality 
if only a few selfISh politiCIans 
weren't maki ng [rouble for us 
WIth theIr terrible weapons. Yet, 
worldwide, we humans daily 
gorge ourselves on the carcasses 
of millions of slaughtered 
creatures - a feast of death that 
is not only savage, but also 
unnecessary, wasteful, unhealthy 
and irreligious. 

The human animal, whose 
teeth aren't designed to rip out 

t~oats, who has no claws for 
teanng flesh , whose dIgestive 
tract IS ill-suited for meat , is 
nonetheless the most 
bloodthirsty creature of all, and 
most proud of it. HIS crafty 
mtelligence can devise the most 
tOrtuous twists and turns of logic 
to JUStify his cruelty. 

And eating flesh isn't the end 
of our barbarity towards animals. 
In the name of medical science, 
researchers in vivisection 
laboratories deliberately torture, 
cripple , blind , pOison, 
dismember and kill thousands of 
helpless creatures every day. All 
thIS IS supposed to "advance" the 
cause of humanity . But what is 
so speCIal about the human 
animal that his cause should 
advance at the expense of so 
many other creatures? How IS it 
"moral" to kill a chimpanzee so 
that we can (perhaps) better 
understand how to save the hfe 
of a baby? How are a 
chImpanzee and a baby 
diffe rent? Both have TWO arms, 
tWO legs and a head. In many 
respects , a chimpanzee is more 
intelligent than a baby. 

The TWo-faced morahst will 
retOrt , 'This IS a specious 
argument. Everyone knows that 
the baby will grow up . The 
chimpanzee will neve r be 
anything more than a dumb 
animal, whereas the baby might 
become a scientIst or a world 
leader." 

And what, then , of the human 
fetus? Can't he also grow up to 
be a SCIentIst or a world leader? 
If we are so concerned about the 
extraordi nary worth of the 
human be 109, why are there 55 
million abontons every year 
worldwlde7 That IS more than 
the total number of deaths In 
World Wars I and II combined 
In the time It takes you to read 
thiS letter, some TWO hundred 
abortions will have taken place. 

No matter how one dresses up 
thIS slaughter WIth sanctimoniOUs 
phraseology, the fact remams: It 
IS slaughte r. Even the 
<;!aughterers themselves know It 
A recent study pubhshed in Time 
shows that of the unmarried 
Amencan men who arranged for 
theIr glrlfriend~ to have an

favor of the Center? The majority 
of students at UC D probably 
will not even see the Center, 
smce groundbreaking occurs in 
18 months, and God only knows 
how much time WIll be needed 
to complete the project. Perhaps 
UCSD students Wish to be 
considerate of fu ture UCSD . 
students by paying mtO the 
Cente r and recelvmg nothlOg in 
rerurn. But I am dIsturbed that sc 
many people wish to be 
considerate of furure students, 
while they are inconsiderate and 
rude to their own generation 

inety percent of students 
entering a lecture hall during a 
lecture allow the door to crash 
dosed , sendlOg a disruptive 
cacophony resonating throughout 
the room. Students deface the 
campus with intellectual phrases 
written on desks, waUs, seats, etc. 

2) Why has no one seemed 
concerned about the taxpayers' 
burden regarding the Center? All 
students receiving financial aid 
will have all or part of the fee 
Increase paid by the taxpayers. 
What if every state university 
passed a fee-affecting 
referendum? Certainly, with the 
present problems facing the 
educational system only now 
beginning to be resolved , we do 
not need a new set of problems. 

3) How can an obviously 
biased vice chancellor, who has 
been quoted as saying, "We're 
very enthUSiastic and pleased 
about It [th e Center!." (Th e 
Tribune, 5-31) be allowed to 
decide whether the vote on the 
referendum IS valid or not, 
espeCially since there is no clear 
legislation that validates the vote? 

Of course , there are other 
controve rsies over the Center, 
such as the whole communlst-
hke effort to push passage of and 
suppress oppOSi tion to the 
referendum, but certainly th ese 
are tOO numerous to be explored 
here.

[In his AS Forum, Steve 
Fnedman ] quoted John Trumpler 
tWice, wh o IS probably the most 
mlsmformed, Irrational, highly 
biased member of the Council. 
;'\JOt only did I he I waste TWO 
paragraphs on hlln , but I he I 
quoted tlllsmformation . The 
seven dollars an hour stipend 
was strictly for the summer 
adVisor Smce that person IS 
titled "AsSistant I," that was the 
pa)' scale we had to use 
econdly. when you recognize 

the hours we put tn, the re.ll 
figure i closer to mmlmum 
wage. 

How could [hel quote John 
companng us to a rape 
prevention progr,11ll when the AS 
polt )' has been to con Ider each 
budget proposal on It S own 

menrs7 I'm a woman , and I'm 
co ncerned about rape 
prevention. But after all, even if 
John wanted to, he couldn't strip 
the ASIG budget down to pad 
hIS own pet projects 

Funhennore , John ma)' sec All' 
.,~ a SImilar progr.Im But their 
arc very Important ddTeren es. 
We are a valuahle alternJtlve . Ask 
All' - \I'e send each other 
students all the time. There IS 
suppOrt tor ASIO. and il )'OU look 
at the Student Center Board 
un'e)' results , you can sec that 

ItS perceived need on campus IS 
astounding. Also , John compared 
us to UC S, but neglected to 
mention the nature of the UCSB 
program , or the people who a re 
involved with it, or their 
motivation for working for 
mInimal stipends, OR all the 
other UC internship programs 
which pay their student workers. 

As for the finance committee 
recommendation of $7,081, that 
decision was made by a mere 
three people who stuck around 
to vote, all of whose minds were 
changed once they actually 
fo und out more about ASIO at 
the hearing. We couldn't inform 
that com mittee earlier about the 
program because we were not 
told about the finance committee 
meeting. 

John Trumpler's bel ief that 
student orgs have no right to ask 
for stipends may be valid . But 
we're not a student org; we 're a 
student service, chartered by the 
AS, and all AS sen/ices are 
stipe nded by the AS. ASIO has 
had stlpended directors since its 
fou nding in 1979, and this is not 
the time to change that, We're 
paid for drudge work. Would 
you work for free as a secretary? 
There are many more reasons 
why we deserve stipends . The 
point is that you didn't bother to 
fi nd those OUl. 

Fortunately, ASIO received 
$13,720 in funding. Please get 
your facts straight before your 
reporting does any further 
damage to ASIO or other 
subjects.

It is unclear to me where the 
published figures were obtained , 
but It is clear that Mr. Friedman 
failed to do his work properly. 
The article's headfng, referring to 
TG allocations in the amount of 
$74,000, is simply incorrect, the 
proper amount being $JO,OOO. 
Not only is th is a flagrant error, 
it is also indicative of the type of 
journalism employed by Mr. 
Fnedman in writi ng the 
remainder of his article . 

The alternative media received 
$37,200, not £38,000, in fu nds; 
there are 11 , not ten , 
pubhca tions applying for 
funding; the new mdicator 
applied for over $15,000 worth 
of funds; and Voz Fronteriza's 
budget request IS nowhere near 
that number, commg in at under 
$7,000. 

Aside from these basic errors 
in the numbers on whIch the 
article rests, Mr. Friedman also 
shows poor journalistlc Judgment 
and expertise . Throughout hiS 
column h' presents on I)' part of 
the pomt at hand , thus m effect 
mlsleadmg the reader. l3y 
admittedly sta ting only part of 
CommI ss ioner of 
Com munica tion Ken Canffe's 
resolution , he falls to supply the 
total picture , wh ich determll1ed 
sllch a resol ution m the first 
place. Had Mr. f'nedman spent 
somc lime m obtalnmg the 
correct budgetary figures, he 
would have realtzed that the l1ew 
Itldlcl1tot was lunded to publish 
III cx,e~s oj tWICe a montll , WlthOUl 

consideration of any outside 
fundin!,;. 

tartll1g with the heading of 
" 74,000 to TG's," his efforts 
seem to be directed at 
misleadmg and mlstnterpretatlOg 
the issue at hand , rather than 
supplying the readership with 
the correct II1formation and his 
VIewpOintS on the subject. Given 
the innuential pos ition that Mr. 
Friedman finds hllnsclf in, this 
kind of shabb), Joum,lllstlc effort 
indIcated a total lack of 
responsibility and 
co nscientiousness on hIS part, as 
well as an apparent editorial 
polic y which fosters ontrove rsy 
rather than thoughtful, high-
prinCipled journalism.

Not only is KSDT not "ONLY 
on AM Cable ," KSDT is not even 
on AM Cable. KSDT is 95.7 FM 
Cable to the San Diego 
Community, and 540 AM Carrier 
Current to the UCSD community. 
And while the word only implies 
that KSDT's coverage is either 
small or incomplete, KSDT is in 
fact the largest land-based cable 
radio station in the United 
States , and is hooked up to 
almost every location 
technically possible , on the 
UCSD campus. In addition, 
KSDT is currently working with 
the administration to pursue a

Tuesday, May 29, 1984, 
proved to be a day of 
enlightenment. On that fateful 
day in academia, one noted 
journalist and appointed judge of 
all mankind was kind enough to 
grace the Koala with his 
unmitigated wisdom in the form 
of a commentary. This 
knowledgeable person , who goes 
by the initials Chnstopher 
Canole, wrote a strikingly 
pOignant article informing the 
students of UCSD what was, in 
his eyes of course, a life-
threatening campus publication. 
Dr. Canole, of course himself a 
noted animal-
physiologist/journalist, depicted 
an extremely interestlng, "factual " 
account of the Koala and ItS 
associated survival and 
behavioral patterns. I, in fact, 
voluntarily discarded my National 
Geographic issue in favor of Dr. 
Canole's well-researched article. 

However, I find it hard to 
discern beTWeen what arc the 
actual patterns of the koala and 
what Dr. Canole Wishes to 
fantasize . Actually, what I read 
was nOt a well-written account of 
the koala , but merely th e writings 
of (or, babbli ngs 01) someone 
who had some chIp on htS 
shoulder and deCid ed to slash 
Irresponsibly at the Koala . 

Interestingly enough, Mr. 
Canole wrote an equally 
informati ve article outhnmg the 
proper etiquette and reasons for 
challengll1g and accepti ng a duel. 
I lound 11 an Irritating portrayal 
of an irresponsible journaltst 
attem pti ng to over hiS own 
derriere. Equally irritating was 
the lact that he attempts to set 
himself up on a pedestal of 
knowledge and IntegTlty by 
merely wruing a eu phemism on 
responsible Journahsm. If this IS 
a proper account , then hiS

LaJ lIa,June 3, 1984 
Dear Graham: 

How are things in the UK the e da),s? 
rhe CTl ckct season must be getting 
under way now. Over here it's the 
baseball season , and we saw our first big 
game the oth er day. Our local lads, the 
San Diego Padres, were playing the LA 
Dodgers, and si nce both teams were 
fighting for first place in the standings 
we looked forward to seeing the fur fly . 

The warm-up exercises and 
exhibltiol\ contests looked promising, 
but that was all the real action we were 
to see. In the entire game which 
followed , one lone, solitary run was 
scored, and that by a Dodger in a Single 
swing. A couple of hours later the 
drizzle was falling and the groundsmen 
were rolling out the tarps, laying a 
shroud over the stiffening corpse of the 
game. Friends assured us that it had 
been a freak, but we decided that it had 
died in part of natural causes, victim of 
the rules of baseball. . 

The batter, for instance, is almost 
doomed to failure . Instead of the Oat-
faced , willow bat used in crkket, he has 
a round one, a dIrect descendant of the 
caveman's club . This means that mis-
hits are frequent, and apt to ny back up 
into the stands. where they cause a 
mi nor brawl as spectators scramble for 
the ouvenir. Anyway, the batter stands 
IVlth hiS club cocked over one shoulder, 
ready to swmg at balls thrown down at 
him by an opponent who stands a shon 
distance away on top of a small hill. If 
the batter fails to hit any of three on-
target balls, he 's out; but as soon as he 
does hit one, he's obliged to sprint for 
the first of three markers, or "bases." 

This mad dash seemed to be a futile 
gesture. Time and again we'd see some 
poor bauer manage to connect with a 
ball , Oing his bat aside and make a bid 
for first base, while the fielding side 
would retrive the ball in a leisurely 
manner, wait till the batter had almost 
reac hed the base , and then throw the 
ball to the fielder waiting there. Batter 
after bauer would bile the dust and walk 
back to the bench with nOthing to show 
for his efforts but a dusty uniform. The 
hfe expectancy of even the best batters 
could be measured in minutes, or even 
seconds, and by the time rain stopped 
pia y both sides had batted and fielded 
six or seven times. As you may imagine , 
playe_rs spent much of the time trotting 
between bench and field . So much 
frenetic actiVity and change, so little 
really accomplishedl 

We were surprised at how few 

held ers th ere were, but oon discovered 
that more would have been redundant. 
Instead uf co\'enng the whole held , as 
111 cncket , baseball fie lders have only a 
90" arc to guard , so we could depend 
on there nelng d fielder ready to catch 
the lew balls whic h batters managed to 
hit high and deep. Also, fielders have 
these giant, padded leather gloves, so it 
was almost a lorgone conclusion that 
they would hold the catches - too 
easyl 

SlI1 ce the dice seemed so loaded 
agai nst th e batting side, the real objec t , 
appeared not to be to score runs but to 
prevent the other side from doing so. 
Everyone was rushing about trying to 
make sure that nothing happened . 
Imagine our surprise, lhen , when we 
read a piece 111 the campus newspaper 
last week by a student columnist who 
drew similar conclusions about cricket. 
According to this gentleman, the 
batsman's role in cricket is to hit only 
the balls which threaten his wicket, and 
then not really to hit them but merely 
dcOect them harmlessly aside, using the 
bat as a kmd of shield . We wondered 
how Gary Sobers could have "deflected" 
those six consecutive sixes CU homeruns,' 
they'd be called over here), or how any 
batsman could reach a respectable score 
by merel), blocking balls. The gentleman 
must have been pulling our legs, we 
concluded. 

oboely would call cricket a fast 
gamc, even though balls can be bowled 
at over 100 mph . A good match needs a 
long, hOt day on a summer weekend to 
ripen. Less would be uncivilized - not 
proper cri cket. And where's the 
co ntinui ty if there 's a new face wielding 
the bat every other minute? The 
batsman needs tlme to settle in and Ind 
his form if he's to make a substantial 
contribution to the score. The results are 
usually worth waiting for. Think about 
the star player finally dismissed after an 
hour or two at the wicket. With 30, 40, 
50 or more runs to his credit -
perhaps even a century - he has the 
satisfaction of having delighted the 
crowd and confounded the bowlers and 
fielders with a masterly exhibmon of 
strokeplay. He's given us not just a 
handful of predictable swings but the 
full repertoire of strokes needed to 
dispatch balls north , south , east and 
west. We have witnessed a performance 
which has that heroic quality of 
etldurance. Having applauded the 
individual strokes and watched the 
player's score gradually climb, 
wondering how long he would survive 
("hang in there" is the tertn they'd use 
over here), we can applaud the 
performance as a whole when the hero 
finall), walks back to the clubhouse , 
removing his cap in acknowledgement 
of the crowd's standing ovation . 

Part of the appeal of cricket, perhaps, 

IS tha t we can sec the human 
experience renected 111 it. The batsman 
going out to the WICket knows the rules 
by which he must play, but he knows 
.11 0 that the rules .Illnw hlill to "hve 
long and prosper," limltcd only hy the 
length of the game and hiS ahlliry to 
lend off danger and seize opportUnitIes. 
With skIll and some luck he could be 
there all afternoon and sc ore a lentury; 
but every ball could also bn ng hiS 
innings to an end . (NOte to editor: 
"innings" is both Singular and plural 111 
cncket, although "mnlng" would he 
correct for baseball ) 

You'll understand all this. of course. 
Graham, but how could we explain It in 
a land where they rejected the Empire? 
Maybe we shouldn't try to explain the 
mystique of cricket - JUSt play the 
game.

After reading both the original article 
(5/ 31 / 84), and the reply in the Guardian 
on (6/1/ 84), I agree with Mr. Papp in 
hIS view that Messrs. Cronin , Radcliff, 
and Rocco were a little overbearing in 
their view of cricket. I do, however, feel 
that Mr. Papp was unjustified in 
reprimanding the above authors It 
seems that Mr.'s Cronm , Radcliff, and 
Rocco have a qualm with Brltam's 
Imperiahstic system, rather than With 
Cricket It does not appear as If they 
ever considered that people play It 
because it IS fun . UCLA ha a CrIcket 
team, but that hardly makes them 
oppressive. I, mysell , have played the 
spOrt, hence, according to the above 
three, I am an oppressor, so let the 
reader beware. 

It seems that Mr.'s Cronm, Radcliff, 
and Rocco are making the same mistake 
as ex-President Carter made , and 
numerous countries are making th is year 
by mixing sports with politics. If the 
above three authors wish to write an 
editorial on British imperialism, I would 
be more than happy to read the article. 
I do, howeve r, feel that Mr. Papp was 
partially resl1flnsible , going from the 
sport of cricket to Nazi pnsons in his 
comment to the reply. 

I do, however, sympathize wi th Mr. 
Papp. It appears as if he was only trying 
to enlighten the public a to the merits 
of cricket. I can just Imagine the shock 
he must have experienced upon readmg 
the reply. As far as I am concerned, 
cricket is cricket, and no more than a 
sport to be enjoyed as are all others. 
Playing "baseball" on a field with no foul 
territory, and a leather-wrapped lead ball 
can be just as phYSically demanding as 
baseball and most other sports. It seems 
that the main objection to cricket is the 
tea served when the sides change. If 

b, seball players an have their tobacco 
and bubble gum, why can 't cncket 
players have their tca7 I feci that a great 
to do has been made over a well-
Intentioned article concern 109 the 
second most popular SpOrt In the world , 
cncket. Mr. Papp and Mr.'s Cronm , 
Raddlff, and Rocco can argue until they 
are blue in the face , but let us hope that 
they do not rUin thc SpOrt for those of 
us who actually play It.

Who played with 
dangerous toys 
By AlAN COLLEY 
When Ronald's Generals were told 
That Ron had sent them lots of gold 
They promised next fmancial year 
To give hlln bombs whi ch all would fear. 

o sooner were they in hIS Sight 
Than Ron got in a dreadful fight 
And being of a hawkish SOrt 
Went nuclear as a first resort. 
The ci ties burned! The earth was gashed ! 
The air was filled with glOWing ash! 
And in the chaos, shrieks and yells 
Were mingled, in this worst of hells, 
With falling skyscrapers and quakes 
And lava as the earth's crust shakes -
Or shook - and worse, when from this rift 
The earth itse lf began to shift; 
The US shuddered to and fro 
As wa lls surrounding Jericho 
And plunged into the sea below, 
Then called the Gulf of Mexico. 
When dust clouds cleared , among lands 
gone 
Were France , Iberia, Ceylon, 
The Argentine, the Brmsh Isles. 
And most of Africa for miles , 
Koreas (both of them ), Peru, 
Plus Canada and Greenland, too. 
Australia, once so attractive , 
Is sadly now radioactive . 
In truSli ng those with little mind, 
Don 't be at all surprised to find 
That at the end of all this strife 
The earth's devoid of human life. 
The: moral is that little Boys 
Should nO[ be given dangerous Toys.

The freeze pro and con Decline and fall 
By KEVIN CLIFFORD 

In hiS commemary "The Dangers of 
the uclear Frenzy" (The Guardian, junc 
4) David Wolf claims that pcople who 
talk about a bila teral, mutually verifiable 
nuclear weapons freezc follow an 
emotionally distorted logic based on 
frcnzied terror. 

YCt the prospect of planctary 
destruction, though commonly 
acknowledgcd by phYSicians, 
meteorologists, physicists and biologists, 
IS often dcnied by high-ranking 
members of the currcm admlllistration . 
For lIlstan e, T.K. jones. Deputy 
UndersecrctalY of Defense lor Research 
and Engllleenng, trateglc and Theater 
,uclear Forces. has st:!ted that the 
L mtrd States could fully recover from 
an all-out nuclear war 1Il Jusr twO to four 
years 

\Ir. Wolf Imphes that thosc who fear 
rhe rmSrect~ of a nuclear war. or those 
who are angry that we are lIlvolved 1Il 
an escalattng arms race that may destroy 
humantl)', are incapable of rational 
thought. ThiS is false . Fear and anger 
may he mottvatlng for es, yet they do 
not determine one's thought processes 
or analytical abihty 

It IS not fear but rather denial of 
reali ty that is dangerous and leads !O 
Irrational deciSIOns. 

As for Mr Wolfs clatm that the 
Departmem of Defense IS nor convlllced 
that a freeze IS verifiable, thiS IS Simply 
not true . Harold Brown, whllc Secreta!) 
of Defense, testified that wtlh any 
nuclear arms comrol agreemem the nsks 
and consequences of discovery make 
VIOlations by the Soviets unlikely. Robert 
Buchhelm, former chamnan of the 
:tandlng Consultative Comm ISSIon, 
states, "We have had and have now 
proficiem I ndependem natIOnal means 
for ven~'lng compliance WIth 
,Igreemems Itmltlng or otherWIse 
controlhng nuclear weapons systems 
and .lctlvlt\es." The tanding 
Consultative CommiSSion IS rcsponslblc 
for determining SoVICt and US 
compliance with nuclear arms limitation

ideas we profess to believe always refer 
hack to our own egos. 

This was inevitable in a society where 
the spiritual aspects of life were pushed 
aSide by the entirely Western invention 
of strictly applied reason. Trying to 
understand the world 10gicaUy leads 
down an eventual infinitude of paths. 
for the world simply isn 't explainable in 
the sense that a computer Circuit, for 
example. can be explained. 

To be an expert on anything, as is 
widely noted. is to be confined to a 
specific field . Sociologists, political 
scientists, psychologists - all such 
people increaSingly expect others to stay 
OLlt of their business. Each field lays 
c1alln ro a specific rurf, even to the 
point of referring in footno tes only to 
lellow writers III the same co ncentration 
for proof of its assertions. 1 hus is 
intellectuali sm fragmented into useless 
specialties. none of which can 
adequately explalll the world or offer 
gU ideli nes on living 

It is thus not surprisi ng that nobody 
believes our experts and intellectuals 
anymore. We might respect them for 
be ing wmy and well-read , but not for 
being true. Reason and logic is coming 
to be accepted as a neatly done trick, 
ranking up there with juggling and 
solvi ng crosswords. The shift among 
educated people to neo-conservatism 
came about because Buckley and Wt!l 
are more entertaming Intellectual 
jugglers than their liberal counterparts, 
not because their ideas are conSidered 
to be tter reflect reality.

Not again, not again: 
the year as it was 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

UCSD has the reputation of being a think-tank 
center where nothing happens beyond books, 
computers and aD-nighters. If you consider lectures by 
Black activist alumni Angela Davis, independent 
Presidential candidate John Anderson, Vietnam war 
planner Roben McNamara, nuclear bomb deSigner 
Edward Teller and Star Tre~ creator Gene Roddenberry; 
Bernard Rands winning the Pulitzer Prize; fistfights in 
the alternative media typesetting room; a bohemian 
festival in homage to a fiberglass god; a lecture hall 
named after the creator of Jack-in-the-Box; and a 20-
year-old University finally planning a Student Center 
as uneventful, then read on. for even more happened 
here in this 1983-84 academic year. 
Se~~r 

New photo identification cards were required for all 
UCSD students, faculty and starr as a measure to save 
funds on campus systems that will eventually become 
automated. 

The long-feared increase in University housing 
rental rates hit UCSD. and the first victims were 
married and graduate students, some of whom are now 
paying 16.7% more than they did last year. 

In spite of deep cuts in the UC budget, UCSD is in 
the midst of one of the most ambitious building 
projects on any college campus, with over $23 million 
slated for development. 
October 

UCSD's Sun God was joined by another distinctive 
sculpture; a life-sized bronze statue of a mestizo 
woman, Francisco Zuniga's "Yucatec Sentada," will be 
installed on the lawn by the Third College Provost's 
()ffice. ' 

The US Starship Enterprise and her crew arrived at 
MandeVille Auditorium as Gene Roddenberry, creator 
and producer of Star rre~, came to UCSD. 

A time of change has dawned upon the UCSD 
Health Center. which appears te be in for more than it 
bargained for as the UC system budget CUtS threaten to 
lower the quality of services to students'. 

UCSD students can now make brief long distance 
phone calls for SO¢ on special "Express Call" pay 
phones. -

In the most frantic, controversial AS meetings to 
date, the votes have been tabulated. and the Coors 
Boycol[ issue was finaDy laid to rest after more than 
three years of debate. 

Dr. Joseph E. Mayer, one of the first faculty members 
appointed to the Depanment of Chemistry at UCSD, 
and one of the chief architects of the depattment. died 
at the age of 79. 

Roben Sheer, national correspondent for the Los 
Angeles Times, was the Regents Lecrurer this month, 
speaking on the nuclear arms race. 
November 

If a perSC!n in the '60s had said Robert McNamara. 
architect of the Vietnam War and the US nuclear 
buildup, would be lecru.ring at UCSD this week in 
opposition to the present US nuclear war strategies. 

Fanubr 
Pla.rutting: 
a choice, 

that person would-have been accused of living in a 
fairy tale . 

The State Senate Finance Committee heard the 
opinions of local educators and members of the San 
Diego legal community on the proposed merger of 
UCSD and the California Western School of Law. 

In three Guardian anicles on Nicaragua appearing on 
one page, "mosqUitoes" was spelled three different 
ways. 

The Student Center Board made the first step 
towards its decision to the process of whether or not 
we are going to invest $47,100 into the Coffee Hut 
facility which houses the Che Cafe and the UCSD 
Guardian. 

The proposal by the AS commissioner of 
communications [0 combine the Alternative Media into 
one publication was a measure that threatened the 
diversity. if not the very existence, of the media on 
campus. 

Champions was a good word for them, for in three 
days UCSD went undefeated to become the number-
one te-am in the nation in both Division II and III 
water polo. 

On the Hump. independent Presidential candidate 
John Anderson addressed several hundred UCSD 
students about the threat of nuclear war and the need 
for a new political force to offer an alternative to the 
"twO old patties."

A fist fight erupted over typesetting between Reggie 
Williams of the new indicator and Paul Lazerson of 
L'Chayim due to problems resulting from Tim Pickwell's 
new typesetting policies. 

The AS Council demonstrated excellent skill by 
saving the AS $260 as they funded the Summer Bridge 
Reunion Dance through lhe use of the KSDT "Mobile 
DJ Unit." 

The AS Council voted to fund the Committee 
Against Registration and the Draft's "Message from 
Europe" forum . 

Due to documents uncovered by UCSD Professor 
Peter Irons, a federal judge recently overtumed a 1944 
Supreme COUrt decision which upheld the legality of 
the internment of over 110,000 Japanese Americans for 
security reasons during WWIl . 
February 

"Computer literacy is highly stressed here at UCSD, 
but reading and writing skills are deemphasized to the 
point of being negligent." said Carol Rogers, newly 
appOinted AS commissioner of academic affairs. 

A doctor in the San Diego community refuted the 
"back-alley set of statistics" presented in the film 
Assignmenr: Life which was shown at UCSD by Campus 
Crusade for Christ. 

CaIP1RG's forum on nuclear war spawned a host of 
pertinent questions, but was ultimately unable to 
produce conclusive statements about possible solutions 
and data relevant to the current nuclear situation. 

Los Angeles is hosting the ()Iympics, but San Diego 
\vill bring home the gold because of one UCSD 
graduate who knows what it takes to be an Olympic 
athlete - Kerry Klosterman, class of 1970. 

"I challenge anybody here to say they are 
representing the interests of UCSD students if they 
vote in opposition to the expansion of the University 
Center." said Ted Herzog. 

UCSD professor Peter Irons appeared on 60 Minutes 
and told the nation about his role in the internment of 
Japanese-Americans during WWIl. 

"It's definitely a campus landmark," says Sue Lewis. a 
junior at Muir. Without a doubt, the Sun God sculpture 
has generated much conversation and mischief.

"Knowledge unfits a child to be a slave ," Angela 
Davis stressed during her lecture in the Mandeville

The UCSD men's golf team claimed its first

UCSD: the year in review 
COliCin ued from page 7 
April 

The 113 students surveyed by the 
ASUCSD Lobby Annex supponed issues 
traditionally opposed by students and 
indicated that they would vote for 
Ronald Reagan this year. 

In a move that was "surprising" to 
some campus officials. Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson publicly announced 
that the UCSD administration will 
provide three million dollars toward the 
construction of the University Center. 

For many Americans. the torment and 
bloodshed of wars in foreign lands does 
not become reality until a friend dies in 
battle. Such was the case when UC D 
alumnus John Hoagland was fatally shot 
while on photographiC assignment in EI 
Salvador. 

The pulsating rhythms and 
exhilarating spirit of Central American 
nighthght burned a UCSD audience as 
Tania Maria returned for an evening of 
music at the Mandeville. 

UCSD professor Bernard Rands won 
this year's Pulitzer Prize for music. 

This year. 2,564 students voted In the 
AS UCSD elections, which resulted in an 
even split between the AS Express and 
the SPUD panies with Marc Boroditsky 
becoming this year's presidenl. 

"Can they even give them away?" was 
the question when the AS Calendars 
were offered for free to students who 
cared to take one of the 5.000 unsold 
pictorial timepieces. 

Roger Revelle, director ememus of the 
Scri pps Institution of Oceanography and 
professor of science and public affairs, 
was elected as the 1984 Tyler Prize 

UlUreate of Ecology-Energy. 
May 

This year, MEChA dedicated Its 
annual Cinco de Mayo celebration to 
"the people from the 1960s who 
struggled to make higher education 
accessible to Raza ." 

With a lame-duc k president Craig Lee 
and three other AS Council members 
clad in rogas, eating fried spuds and 
drinking Coors beer. the Council passed 
controversial stipends for the incoming 
council. 

Thousands of bohemians flocked to 
worship the Sun God at this year's 
festival. 

For the lourth time in 12 years, the 
students on that northern campus tried 
to find an official name; a rose is a 
rose .... 

"What hath the Stuart Collection 
wrought this time?" asked one of this 
school's more classically-minded 
gentlemen when he first observed the 
Richard Fleischner installation just south 
of Cluster Library. 

The student body in the referendum 
voted 54.4% to 45 .6% in favor of adding 
$25 to their fees to finance a new 
University Center. 

Erratum 

Phil Lauder of "writer's i" fame was 
voted the UCSD Guardian 's new Editor-
in-Chief. taking over for Tim August, 
who has been responsible for the new 
Guardian format and quality of content. 
june 

In a time of political and economic 
confusion between the United States 
and its neighbor south of the border, 
the UCSD Center for US-Mexican 
Studies is leading the way to new 
understanding. evident in the new 
building under construction near 
Central Library. 

After nearly 12 hours of debate over 
the 1984-85 budget, the AS Council 
succeeded in finding ample money for 
most of the major programs and 
services. 

The final event of the year, a TGIO 
featuring the Bus Boys, drew the largest 
crowd in UCSD history to dance in 
ecstasy to music before the agony of 
finals week. 

New photo identifications are 
required for all UCSD students. faculty 
and staff to replace the inadequate new 
plastic IDs distributed at the first of the 
year. Maybe things are dull and 
repetitive here after all. 

The AS Forum in theJune 4 edition of the Guardian incorrecdy reponed the amount 
of money allocated to AS Programming for the 1984-85 year. The correct amount is 
$29,400, not the $78,000 reponed. Fifteen thousand dollars of this will go to the 
promotion of TGs. We apologize for the misunderstandings this has caused.

different types of jobs. Affirmative action 
efforts ... are essential in this regard." 

"Waiting for affirmative action will 
not do it," contradicted Corbo. He 
thinks that leaving the system as it is 
and working with it is not an active 
enough approach. His solution involves 
politics. 

AFSCME has "convinced the 
Legislature" that an overhaul is 
necessary. Indeed, Carbo assens that ihe 
Assembly has allocated $4.7 million and 
the Senate $10.8 million (subject to the 
Governor's approval) to "reconcile the 
differences" in pay plans. That is. the 
UC system would be obliged to direct 
another study by December 1. 1984 to 
be conducted by "an independent 
source," with the results showing that a 
new system must be implemented. 

Como said that this approach has 
been successful in Washington state, 
MinneSOla and Iowa, with positive 
results obvious within a couple of years 
after action was initiated. Minnesota 
conducted and reconstructed its 
programs on its own, while AFSCME 
had to sue Washington to achieve 
visible action. If the Governor does not 
approve AFSCME's and the Legislature's 
suggestions to cause UC to conduct 
anocher study, Corbo said it "is very 
likely" that AFSCME win sue again.

Budman's 1984 1M Softball All·Star Team 

A tradition at UCSO is now beginning 
with the 1st Annual [n tramural All· tar 

oft ball Team. The National League has 
an All· tar Team. The American League 
has an All· tar Team. The Podunk Class 
A Northwest League has an All· tar 
Team. Heck, even every little league has 
an All· tar Team. Now UCSD has one! 

These are the elite of the elite. The 
cream of the crop. The best at their 
po itions. 

The selection process wa a long and 
tedious one. We took a combination of all 
the different methods used by the 
different professional sports. We took 
votes from the media. The Guardian. The 
Koala and KSDT all ent in their ballots. 

• 

We let t he fan s voice their opinion ala 
baseball. Many votes poured in. Just last 
week four guys came in and voted. The 
month before t\\'o guys voted. We also 
allowed the umpires to vote. This is an 
unusua l precedence. But who sees the 
player day in and day our more than the 
umpire ? Of course, if you are a habitual 
complainer your name was left out by the 
Um ps. Last but most importantly was the 
vote of yours truly, the Budman. I took in 
all factors in determining my votes. 
HItting, defense, speed, arm, team play 
and how many beers a particular player 
bought me at the Pub. Enough of all of 
this . Let me introduce the Lst Annual 
UCSD Intramural oft ball All·Star 
Team: 

CATCHER Alexis Waadt • Still Dirt Cheap 
Batting Average: .650 / Home Runs: 6 / RBI's : 40 

This is the position in softball where you try to hide somebody. ot this gal. She takes 
pride in her duties a catcher. She's also one of the few females who doesn't allow those 
ball hogging chauvinist males to run in from another position and take the throw from 
outfield. Shes been known to kick these low life humans where it hurts. She runs well, 
whew, hits with a little power and can distract the hitter.

The original wheeze kid . Greg is in the twilight of his career. But he can still play some 
bal\. Year in and year out he hits a solid . 700. He has led 1M's in hitting six out of the last 
eight years. He would have more home runs except my mother runs faster than he does . 

SECOND BASE - Greg McCambridge· ZBT's 
Batting Average: .350 / Home Runs: 2 / RBI' s: 10 

The one thing that there are not a lot of in Intramural Softball at UCSD are second 
ba emen who can turn the double play. Well Greg is the best . He's as sweet as candy. He's 
Nureyev when it comes to the deuce. Greg doesn 't have the most feared bat in 1M's. But 
you can get out of a [ot of jams with that Quick dou ble play and he can turn It. 
SHORTSTOp· Lori Monette· D·Street Band 
Batting Average: .707 / Home Runs: 20 / RBI' : 100 

Lori led the highest scor ing team in 1M's in average, home runs, and RBI' s. She's got the 
stats. She leads all 1M's in home runs and RBI's. She's no slouch on the defense either. She 
can t hrow a ball through a brick wall. 

THIRD BASE· Laszlo Gyorffy • COX 
Batting Average: .575 / Home Runs : 14 / RBI' s: 60 

Boy can this guy control the hot corner. To play third base you haveto have the guts of a 
kamikaze pilot and an arm like a rifle. Laszlo has both Qualities. He is one of the few third 
sackers who stays in front of the ball on Pryatel Field. No one said that he was s mart. He 
has good power but has a tendency of getting hurt in the big games. 

LEFT FIELD· Eric Zimmer - Get·A·Grip 
Batting Average: .560 / Home Runs: 19 / RBI' s: 85 

This was an easy choice. If you have ever seen Eric play you would know why. He has 
the bes t arm 10 IM '~. He hit the ball a mIle. And he is a nice guy to boot. Remember me Eric 
when I need medical attention. Eric's a thIrd year Med tudent. 

CENTER FIELDER - Peter Remedios· Brutal Puppydogs 
Batting Average: .600 / Home Runs: 1 / RBI' s: 20 

Peter is your perfect speed guy. He leads off, gets on base and plays a tremendous 
centerfield. His team won it all last year so he's a winner. If you were only a little taller 
Pete. 

RIGHT FIELD - James Ty on· Return of the Bung Hole Bangers 
Batting Average: .684 / Home Runs: II / RBI's: 55 

James can wheel wah the best of them. Right field is another of those positions where 
captains have been know n to hide people. That 's not true in pro ball as the right fielder is 
always the best defenSIve outftelder. It's also not true on the Bangers. Now if the owner of 
the Bangers could only give James a bigger contract so hecouldgoout and buy orne shoes. 

PITCHER· Mike Delbick • The Harshers 
Wins: 8 / Losses: I / ERA: 0.87 

Pitcher was a tough position to pick. There are many excellent pItchers at USD. But 
none has done what Mike has done thi s year. That is to pitch a no· hitter. What an 
accomplishment that is. There have only been two in UCSD's hallowed 1M softball 
history. Not only did he throw a no·hitter but he was one batter away from the never 
before achieved 'perfect game.' 

MANAGER OF THE YEAR· Reed 'Bum' Martin· Comedy of Errors 
There's no coincidence Reed goes by the nickname Bum. This is in reference to Bum 

Phillips the tremendous down home coach of the New Orleans Saints. Reed not only has 
the coaching abilities of Bum Phillips but he even resembles him . Same amount of hair, 
same waistline. As far as motivating a team there is no one better. A soft word to a 
despondent player after an error. A team chant before gametime. Persuading play~rs ~o 
show for practice by furnishing cases of Bud, and of course hls game strategy whIch IS 
most crucial. I asked Bum what his strategy was. Bum's reply, "Let 'em fall where they 
lay." Yogi Berra couldn 't have said it better Bum. 

It's E~<;A Time Again! 
The Empty Beer Can Award are 

back ... bigger and juicier than ever. After 
a year· long fling at everyt hing frivolous 
that Intramural ports has to offer, we 
figured it on ly appropriate to relive some 
of the high· lites and low· lites of the past 
intramural year. It was a busy one for 
ure ... and as we say every year, " I{ead 

'em, but don't weep ... you earned every 
one of them! " 

Coolest Dude in IMs ... Brad Oriver 
(Blue Ludes} ... just ask him. Brad had 
everything a guy could want except a 
backhand. I mean, here's a guy who had 
gorgeous Egyptian girls chauffeuring him 
between the 1M fields and every bar in La 
Jolla. What a guy! Now if he just had a 
backhand. 

Airhead of the Year (awarded 
perpetually) .. . who else, but Laszlo 
Gyorffy (PWP) ... last year Laz got the 
award for failing to show up for work. 
Thi year, Laz, a little older but not 
necessarily wiser, managed to pull the 
arne stunt. Oh well, the third time is 

supposed to be the charming one 
Most Hilarious Sight of the 1M 

Year (awarded perpetually} ... to the guys 
from SWAMP as they returned their 
rented golf cart to the pro ship with two 
flat tires. The poor cart had no chance 
when Adams, Jones, Floyd, Pelletier and 
Co. tried to negotiate a 20·foot canyon on 
the fly at the 13th hold. 

1M Athlete of the Year .. Jayson 
Brugman (In 'N Out Urge, Homer's 
Boners} ... single·handedly carried his 
teams to play·off bert hs in -all sports 
despitejay Richards. Finished fifth in the 
best Superstars competition ever. Not too 
'shabby for a married guy. . 

Most Likely to be the Next Official 
tarter at the Indy SOO ... Gina Simone 

Cres t Tube Babies} ... "Gentlemen, start 
your engines" was destined to be uttered 
by Gina's sensuous lips. 

1M Athlete Most Affected by 
Drugs ... Howard Branstone (Bat boys for 
Arbitration) ... No Howard, the Giants will 
not win the pennant thi s year. 
Fantasyland, however, is just up the 
street. 

1M Milestone of the Year ... Sigma 
Kappa Sorority (Soft ball) ... became the 
first sorority team in the history of the 
university to play their entire regular 
season without forfeiting a game. 

Worst Case of Intramural 
Schizophrenia ... Nancy Anderson and 
her Come With Beer Bunch ... these gals 
waltzed through hockey like Sherman 
marched through Georgia, but when it 
came for oftball! Ugh! (Well , they did tie 
a game once). Hope y'all brought 
Budweiser to the game. 

Best Med School Team in 
Intramurals ... the Second Year 
Bunch ... despite Tom Barman, this team 
cranked in most of the big sports: football, 
basketball, and softball. 

Best Fraternity in IMs ... Delta 
Sigs ... Not even the Budman can be 
bought by the Bud Campus Rep. 

Muhammed Ali Memorial 
Award ... Dave Mueller (Butt State} ... 
when it came to playing a rough and 
tumble sport like 1M football, Dave 
always was the coolest guy on the field . 

Shortest Arms in IMs .. . Chris Ferrez 
(York Hunt Club) ... Chris stretched as far 
as he cou ld with his stubbies, but he fell 
an inch short of a touchdown in the Mens 
AAA Championship Football Game. 

1M Gameofthe Year ... PWPvs. York 
Hunt Club(Football) ... Another classic for 
the history books. Thank goodness. Now 
we can retire those midget footballs. 

1M Softball Player Most Likely to 
Strike Out Under Pres8ure ... Tom 
Barman (Aluminum I{ods} ... you can 
count on Tommy in the clutch , he' ll whiff 
every time. 

Monkey Off My Back A ward .. Jody 
Mai (Floaties) ... after a few decades of 
trying, Jady and the Floatles finally won 
their fir st 1M Waterpolo championship. 
And now that that has happened, the 
world will be a much safer 

It Really Was 
Smooth Sailing 

• • 

Intramural Sports at UCSD in 1983·84 
might best be described as a year in 
transition. In midyear. we picked up our 
belongings, forged our way to the other 
side of campu , and established our new 
home at Ca!1yonview. 

[t disrupted the flow of info for many of 
your, but in the long·run we' re hoping 
that it will help to improve our service of 
your recreational needs. 

[n addition toour exodus to the east, we 
also brought on board an entirely new 
crew (s tudent superv isors) to help you 
navigate the high seas of adventure that 
you've all come to know and love as 
intramural sports. 

1M Commanders Hipp and Berndes 
were a little apprehensive at fir st, 
especially when they surveyed their new 
recruits and found an eager, but 
relatively raw and untested grou p of 
abled· bodies. 

And in a hurry , we found out that this 
was going to be no la·di·da cruise to the 
South Pacific. There were a couple of ill· 
fated tacks to the starboard early on, and 
then one of the crew members decided to 
walk the plank for some unknown reason. 

But ev-entually things worked 
themselves out, the SS bliramltralis 
cleared the first two buoys, and it was 
clear sailing from then on in. And believe 
us when we tell you ... the crew of '84 did a 
magnificent job. Taking on more 
responsibility as each day passed , this 
group of hardy adventurers learned more 
and did more than any pre\iious crew in 
recent history. And they had more fun 
while doing it. 

Their sacrifices and dedication to the 
spirit of intramural sports did not go 
unnoticed and we're pleased to report 
that most of them have signed on again 
for another stint at sea next season. If 
you ' re going to be around, Intramural 
Sports will be really dynamite nex t year. 

Most of you know this group by 
sight...but you really don'thlOw them like 
we do. Here's just a brief tongue-in·cheek 
rundown on all of the personalities that 
kept 1M Sports afloat in 1984. 

Sandbagger Team of the 
Year ... Party Animals (Footbal l, 
Basketball} ... but not Softball, you front· 
runners. 

Punk/ Rock Star of the Year in 
IMs .. . Steve Remba .. . Stevie can two·tone 
with the best of them. 

Who Are You Kidding A ward? .. 
Flying Tigers (Coed Floor Hockey) .. . After 
going undf!feated during the regular 
season in Coed A the Tigers were moved 
up to Coed AA for the play·offs. Captain 
Bnan Mitchell bitched likecraz y, then led 
his team on a blitz to the champion hip. 

Most Studious 1M U mpire ... l:lob 
Armell ... Bob was the kind of buddy 
everybody should have. He was especi ally 
great at grabbing a roommale to take his 
umpiring assignments so that he could 
grab some extra study time. Then one 
inning into the first game, you'd see him 
holding hands with some babe beyond the 
right field fence. 

Best Concentration Under 
Pressure by an 1M Athlete .. John 
Burda (at Over·the-Line Tournament) ... 
John could barely s tand up, but he got his 
team into the final Eight. 

Most Impressive Athl etic 
Accomplishment by UCSD Students 
... Andrew Keeler & o ... after 9 long 
years, Andrew, a distant cousin to 
Baseball Hall·of·Famer, Wee Willie 
Keeler. and his teammates annexed the 
first ever Men 's Championship for a 
UCSt) team with a 35·34 win over San 
DIego State. Buddy that. 

1M Athlete Most Likely to Become 
President of the United States .. Julie 
Zianno (Hetter Luck / Ultimate 
Disc) .. Julie is plenty ambitious and 
usually gets her way, and she' ll probably 
make an excellent President. But she'll 
sti ll be short of her real goal...gelting to 
officially wear an 1M staff shirt. 

"Admiral" Danny Walters ... this 
portly junior was affectionately known as 
"Tubbs" by his TKE fraternity brothers. 
And for good reason. Walt rarely turned 
down a meal, especially if it was french· 
fried and free. He was also the kindof guy 
who liked to do it all. In basketball, he 
took all of the shots. In football (even 
though he played center), he called all of 
the plays, and for some reason that his 
teammatrs still can't figure out. all of the 
long bombs seemed to wind up going in 
his direction. 

For a guy who liked to have his hands 
on everything (his girlfriend, the mashed 
potatoes, and at least two cans of 
Budweiser, for example), Danny had just 
a terrible time holding on to a football 
thrown to him in crucial situations. 
That's OK; though ... anyone who's the 
Budweiser Campus Rep can't be all bad. 

"Lt. Commander" Hans Wiersma 
...the "Weese ..... a perfect complement to 
any crew. This low· key guy took the "art 
of cruising" to new levels of excellence. 
He also brought the staid, conservative 
1M Dept up to more contemporary "new 
wave" standards with his designer 
sunglasses and his mix 'n match madras 
shorts. Weese is also the guy who 
designed the "hot" OTL T ·Shirts that 
somehow in the end came out lookingjust 
like himself. But don't let his Quiet, good. 
natured facade fool you ... deep down 
inside, he's always wanted to be a 
bottomless breakdancer at Chippen· 
dale's. 

"Lieutenant" Larry AleLcame into 
the program with a surprising amount of 
"cruising" experience also .. . especially 
when you note that his entire childhood 
was spent in that wonderful water land of 
America ... New Mexico. Larry is decidedly 
left· handed which totally explains all of 
his behavior patterns which in short can 
be summed up in one word .. . WEIRD! 

Larry pitches softball for his team 
right·handed, but catches come-backers 
to the mound and throws out runners 
with his left (figure that one out). He's 
also the only known poker player alive 
who will raise five consecutive pots to the 
max while holding nothing better than an 
Ace-Hi. That's OK though, his generosity 
kept the entire Intramural Staff in the 
black for the entire school year. 

Larry 's most brilliant moment, 
however, occurred during Winter 
Quarter while he was supposed to be 
working. One minute after sneaking into 
a pick·up basketball while on university 
time, our friend Larry broke his ankle. 
And who say Governor Deukmejian 
doesn't 'have connections upstairs. Sorry 
Larry, no workman's comp for you. 

"First Mate" Matt Adams ... 
founder, president, and chief dis-
organizer of the legendary SWAMP ... 
Uncle Matt has squeezed more out of life 
at UCSD than any known mortal. During 
the day, Matt negotiates his way through 
UC like any other ambitious 
student .. . studies, plays varsity 
basketball, and every 1M sport invented, 
or not yet invented. However, when the 
su n goes down this guy can be dangerous. 

With Matt (at the Helm), the guys from 
SWAMP have given new definitions to 
the meaning of "midnight patrol," " road 
trips," and "keggers." 

Their penchant for " monkeying 
around" the perimeters of campus at 
night has caused the campus security 
budget to triple in the past year. 

Never impeccably dressed, Matt's swan 
song to 1M coaching ended in complete 
shambles last winter. In the Men's A 
Championship game before a packed 
house, Malt walked into the gym in a 12· 
piece suit that only your grandmother 
cou ld appreciate, blinding everyone 
within 20 feet of him (mostly his own 
players). SWAMP's 5-for·41 shooting in 
the first half destroyed any chance of 
finally winning an 1M Championship. 

"Bosun's Mate" Bob Patterson .. . 
this basketball junkie has the common 
sense of a raccoon. For some reason his 
favorite s ports activity is basketball, even 
though he suffers from one of the worst 
cases of "white man's disease'" in the 
storied annals of medical science. In his 
fir t attempt at innertube waterpolo, he 
tried to jump into the pool but somehow 
stubbed his toe on the lip of the indoor 
pool (what lip?)and didn't make it . During 
one 1M Men 's AAA game this year, 
referees Paul Rasmussen andMark 
Barreca blew their whistles, stopped the 
game, and gave Bob the game ball after 
they both noticed a small space of 
daylight between Bob's basketball shoes 
and the floor. 

Bob's real forte in life, however, is to be 
frugal. Too cheap to afford his own 
haircuts, Bob last was seen with a pair of 
scissors looking upside down into a bowl 
of water trying to figure if the right side of 
his hair matched the left side in length. 

"Stowaway" Jay Kuo ... this little 
guy came to UCSD on the original s low 
boat from China. And that's been UCSD's 
loss. This fella loves to work like no one 
else we've ever seen. Working three 
consecutive nights until 4 in the morning 
is a maller of routine for this dynamo. 
Jay's voca bulary is limited, however. 
"Give me more hours" is the only thingto 
come out of his mouth since he was hired 
in April. 

Jay loves to play all 1M s ports , but had a 
particularly frustrating time with one of 
them this past winter. During the soccer 
season, Jay set a newall-ti me record by 
missi ng 46 consecutive open-goal scoring 
chances in soccer. It got so bad at one 
point that goalies started to light up 
cigarettes when they saw Jay closing in 
on goal. 

1M Soccer Czar Scott Berndes is 
considering widening the goals to an even 
hundred feet next season to give our 
friend Jay a better chance . 

"Man Overboard" Jay Richards ... 
"JR Superstar," as he is so affectiona tel y 
known by all of Third College, was 
discovered missi ng at sea last winter and 
somehow vanis hed from the Purser' s 
payroll ledger. No big deal though. Before 
the disappearing act, JR contributed as 
much as anyone to the 1M staff's 
commitment to good times. Their 
commitment to hard work? Now that's 
another matter. Just kidding. ( mile) 

JR 's misfortunes began when he 
discovered gambling, women, and 
drinking all in the same breath. (Smile). 
But he learned quickly how to handle all 
three. Santa Anita took every paycheck, 
he hasn't had a date in weeks, and he's 
still looking for his 21st birthday. No 
problem here. (Smile). 

JR's real saving grace has been his 
devotion to the intramural spirit. Never 
one to miss an 1M contest (ahem!) or a 
good time (yahoo!), JR will always go 
down in 1M history as one of a kind. 
(Smile.)

Midnight Orange 
"By CHERYL SAWYER 

"Are you guys dOing anything 
tonight?" Malt asked us, opening the 
cupboard In hIS ru t-colored bathrobe 

"No, well, we haven't planned 
anything," Rand} answered . 

"Have you heard of Stanle) Kubnck1" 
asked Malt , spooning some Tang into a 
plastic glass 

"Isn t he a Jazz ... " 1 guessed. 
"Who IS hd" Randy interrupted 
"He dI rected the movIe A Clockwork 

Orange. It's plaYIng somewhere around." 
"Oh yes! It's a great movIe ," Randy 

exclaImed. "It s got great Irony, the 
irony's great! Find out when It 'S 
plaYIng." He looked at me as If to 
emphaSIze with hIS eyes how good the 
movie is. "But 1 don 't know, you mIght 
not like It," he said, although nOt to 
discourage me from going. 

"Isn't there supposed to be a lot of 
violence In Il?" I asked. 

'Well , yes ... uh, kind of," he 
answered . Matt was stirnng up the little 
bubbles of orange powder that had nOt 
dIssolved completely In the water. 

I wonder where It'S playing. Where 'd 
you put the Reader, man?" Matt asked 
Randy. "Old you throw It out?" 

"Yes," he s,lId , reaching around to the 
trash and digging out the newspaper. 
"['m ,Ilk of this place beIng a mess," he 
mumbled but Matt wasn't ltstentng. 

I moved OntO th e carpet closer to the 
TV to hear "Dallas" better JR, the evil 
tycoon, had hIred a woman 10 5edu«~ a 
young lav.'Yer so he could get to hiS 
father's will. 

"Jee:. what a whore - the,e 
women ... Randy said , "I can't believe 
thiS world IS filled WIth nothing but 
whores Isn t th at true, Matt] Aren tall 
women whores?" he asked loudly, 
knOWing I'd get upset. I gOt up from the 
arpet, pretending to be madder than I 

actually was. 
"I don't have 10 put up WIth thIs ,' I 

saId. and went Into hiS room to read

The dlT! 011 the WindshIeld and the

"I need to get some water in my car 
to SqUITl the window." Rand}' saId , 
dnvlng tOO fast We pulled IntO KWlk 
Gas before the freewa) and Randy drove 
O\'er to the "aIr and water" stand . 1 
thought he was gOing to open the hood 
and ftll the water CO nIalner, but Instead 
he began to wet down the front of his 
car, then his windshield , then the side 
wllldows. He pulled the hose around 
the back and continued hOSing It down. 

"We're gOing to be late ," Matt said. 1 
thought, Why is he dOing thIS now? I 
looked on the floor of the car and saw 
Randy's prescription glasses among 
crumpled papers and orange peelings. I 
put them on for fun and rolled down 
the window a crack. 

"Hey Randy, this Isn't a car wash ," I 
said . "Here ," 1 shouted, holding out the 
large hunks of orange peel, "throw these 
out." He leI (he wa ter hose snap back 
into the ground and yanked on the air 
hose. "Oh no! He wants to blow it dry," 
1 said , rolling up my eyes w1th 
impatience , bUI he gave up and got 
back into the car. 

Randy put on hIS emergency blinkers

Matt, who came out of his

I gave half of m)' beer to Randy, who 
guzzled the rest of his and most of mine 
down in the parkmg lot of the UA 
cinema. He se t my beer, sull about one-
fourth full , on hIS steenng wheel. i 
looked at the bottle res[I ng dangerously 
against the horn and watched his right 
leg rub agai nst the bottom o( the 
steeTlng wheel and spill rhe beer. 

"Oh well," he saId, palling the foam 
with his dITty whIte moccasins, whose 
backs are flattened from nOt sltpping lhe

now seem more like go-a head sandals 
needi ng to be kept on by a combined 
actIon of hIS toes and the balls of his 
feet. 

"]'11 tell you what, I'll pay for half your 
ticket," Randy said quietly to me while 
we stood III line. 1 noticed the blond 
guy with da rk eyebrows in front of us 
when he said, "Yeah, like they've got the 
killer stuff up In the Bay Area," to his 
friends. Randy must have interpreted 
the word "killer" for "kill her:' because 
he said quiet ly, "ktll who? They hIlled 
somebody?" Randy noticed how big the 
blond guy's feet were and told me to 
have a look 

"You thlllk they'd charge less at the

Randy the difference for my tlckel. A

disgust and looked down at my lap. 
"Ssst, God , it 's only a movie, don't be 

stupid !" Randy whispered loudly in my 
ear. "Don't be stupid, nothing happens'" 

"Leave me alone," I said , folding my 
arms. He shook his head and pulled his 
arm away from arou nd my shoulde rs. 
But fifteen mi nutes later he began to 
touch me agai n and I rubbed his 
forearm. 

"You know, it was weird how some of 
the women had that purple or orangish 
hair and others didn't," I said in the car 
on the way back, trytng to stan up a 
conversation about the film . "It didn't 
seem as though Kubrick followed 
th rough with his futuristic ideas." 

"Yeah, I don 't know, it was weird," 
said the first Matt. Randy was silent. 

1 started thinking about Randy telling 
me I was a baby for not watching the 
rape scenes. I couldn't understand why 
he got so mad about it. If I didn't want 
to watch lhem I didn't have 10, and who 
was he to leU me that I should? 

"You know, Randy," 1 said after a long 
period of li stening to the clack-clack of

The crowbar and the chrysanthemum 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

Monty took the summer job because 
of the hazardous bonus pay. 

Some crusading Park Avenue New 
York City councilman recently woke up 
to the fact that Harlem was a dangerous 
place at night, so he pushed through a 
bill to install reflector buttons down the 
streets' center divider. Maybe he thought 
standing beside a reflector as a car 
approached would help the driver see 
one's shoes. 

Ten thousand reflectors were 
purchased from the councilman's 
brother in the Bronx. 

Just enough money was left for a pick, 
bucket, pair of gloves and one work-
study college student. 

For ten hours a day in the battlezone 
of Harlem's traffic, Momy tightrope-
walked between cars coming anc;! going 
nowhere. Ten times an hour Monty dug 
a hole in the pockmarked asphalt, 
dropped the black lump in the bucket, 
then installed one of the councilman's 
"Stars for Safety," all the while dodging 
pimps' Caddies and cabbies' insults. 

To break the monotony he imagined 
himself as Paul Newman sweating it out 
on a prison road gang in Cool Hand 
Luke. Sometimes he escaped so 
thoroughly imo his fantasy that the 
flickering of the streetlights igniting 
Signaled he had actually worked 
ovenime. 

Placing the 2,457th reflector into its 
black hole , the star illuminated in his 
hand by the oncoming headlight, he 
thought to himself, ovenime again! 

"Hey Johnny Appleseed , whatcha 
doin' in the Crows' territory?" 

Looking up from the black surface, 
Monty's eyes couldn't see the body of 
the voice coming from the sidewalk, so 
he didn't respond to the question. 

"You deaf-n-dumb? When a Crow 
talks to you, you beuer answer or run." 

Still half immersed in his Cool Hand 
Luke fantasy, Monty said , "What we 
have here is a failure to communicate." 

"Maybe you'd like to communicate 
with this!" Out of the dark Hashed a 
chrome-plated crowbar. "We're the 
Crows." A dozen more bars bolted imo 
the night sky. 

The Crow chief stepped into the 
light. "What you got here is a failure to 
respect Crow country." The steel and 
power of his crowbar matched his 
fearsome build . "We're just public 
servants who make sure no stray nails 
stick themselves in our streets. It's our 
duty to hOQk our bars undrr your head 
and pry you out. Sometimes we do get 
carried away and pull a few fingernails." 

"But I'm unarmed ," Momy pleaded . -
"What's lhat in your hand? Aren't you 

a warrior for rhe Central Park Picks?" 
You must be mi staken. I've never 

fought in my life." 
"You're the one who's made the 

mistake comin' here. Tell you what, I'm 
feelin' REAL generous tonight." He 
tossed his crowbar to Monty. "Take my 

weapon and prepare for your first and 
last battle. Just you and me. You got 24 
hours. If you don 't show, we'll come 
after you and pry your limbs outta their 
sockets. Now beat it" The Crows 
banged their bars against parking meter 
poles as Monty turned and ran. 

Twenty-four hours ... to live . 
Riding the subway back to his 

apanment in Soho, another rider who 
looked like a dark aUy horror story saw 
the crowbar. ·Crow ... I hear your 
warriors snuff people JUS! for being in 
the wrong place at the wrong time." Just 
what Monty didn't want to hear, a 
confirmation of his death sentence. 

Back at his apanment Monty called 
his friend Ethan who was iOlO manial 
ans, and explained his 24-hour 
situation. "Wish I could help you Monty, 
but I have never studied zen and the an 
of miracles. There's a Japanese florist 
you might contact." 

"What... to order a funeral wreath, is it 
that hopeless?" Monry took down the 
address anyway. 

The next morning Monty ate his last 
breakfast of IOmalO juice and biscuits at 
Emmanuel's Deli. Since Musashi's 
Cherry Blossom Aorist was only 13 
blocks away, he decided to walk. Monty 
thought a night without much sleep 
must sharpen one's senses - everything 
and everyone seemed to be more alive 
today. 

Entering the nower shop, Monty 
heard a loud "Kote!" 

"Mr. Musashi?" Monte called out. "I've 
come here to make funeral 
arrangements." Now even he was 
realizing the futility oC this visit. 

"Whose?" 
"Mine." 
The cunain to the back room paned, 

and a bald downlike face appeared. 
"Sounds like you need a special 
arrangement. When do you want 
delivery?" 

Monty looked at his watch. "In ten 
hours ." 

"We do not have much time. Please 
explain why you are in such a hurry." 

It's not my decision. I'd like lO put it 
off for s.o years." Monty sat down and 
recounted the events of the last day. "So 
1 think a simple wreath is all I need." 

"Got a special just Cor you: one nower, 
a chrysanthemum. It comes with free 
delivery." 

"My friend told me you ' were a master 
in something called kendo and would 
help me. What good will one nower 
do?" 

·You already realize situation is 
hopeless, no time to train you. So why 
not die like true ancient warrior?" 

Musashi picked up a chrysanthemum, 
produced a flash of steellrom nowhere, 
and thundered, "KOle !" He returned the 
long knife to its sheath . "Kendo" the an 
of swordsmanshIp, exists -in aU daily 
actions , even cutting Hower stems. 
Kote!" Another stem fell. "Kote is the 
warning cry you make to your opponent

that you have cut off his hands and 
disanned him from bothering you. 

"Go to work now. Stand fearless 
berween the charging cars. Dig out each 
hole with one totally committed stroke. 
Once your bucket is overflowing with 
the old worn-out tar, empty it qUickly, 
withoul hesitation. Fill your empty holes 
with stars. And keep in mind kendo is 
picking holes and carrying buckets. 
Think of nothing else. . 

-Then tonight I will meet you for your 
final lesson." Musashi turned and left, 
leaving Mooty no opponuntty lO 
question his instructions. 

Nine-and-a-half hours later Monty 
stood, exhausted and yet exhilirated , on 
the fatal street comer. He felt someone 
behind him and quickly turned ... 
Musashi. "How long have you been 
standing here?" 

"long enough to see you learn well, 
but the outcome may still be the same." 
Musashi reached into his pocket and 
placed a delicate white chrysanthemum 

on the oily ground in the middle of a 
side alley. 

"Allow your opponent all the 
advantages. Stand under the light so he 
can clearly see you. Hold the crowbar in 
both hands over your head, exposing -
your entire body. Since you have already 
accepted the outcome, be fearless. If you 
step on the chrysanthemum as you 
attack, with no thought of life or death, 
you will feel no loss: 

Was Musashi creating magic? 
"You're a fool. " The Crow chief and 

his street warriors blocked off the alley 
from the outside world. Momy glanced 
away from the Crow - Ml!sashi was 
gone. 

Before Monty could worry about what 
would happen next, the Crow chief 
charged down the aDey. 

As the Crow drew back his bar 
preparing to strike, he saw a crushed 
white flower shining like a star against 
the black night.

Wind-filled Mind 
By J.P. PREIMESBERGER 

My attraction to the wind began in 
my youth when my brothers and I 
discovered how the fierce Santa Ana 
winds could whip us down our San 
Fernando Valley street on our bikes. 
From the north end of the block, we 
pedaled furiously five houses to our 
house , kicked up our feet , and the wind 
swept us a quarter of a mile down the 
street. The overwhelming power of the 
wind fiUing our Jackets like sails thrilled 
us , even more in the struggle to get back 
home. 

As a kid, the wildness of the wind 
across my face always compelled me to 
pause . It was the same exhilaration 
whether I was coasting on my bike, 
shouting on a roller-coaster or, to the 
dismay of my parents, sticking my face 
out of the car window on the freeway. 

Now as I review my first year at 
UCSD, I realize , as much as I am in love 
with the beach on a hot sunny day, the 
most poignant moments were wind-
blown ones. 

I first noticed the wind during the fall 

v _ ... '" ... 
/~ 

arrival of the Santa Anas. I swam laps 
that noon at the Canyon View pool. 
When I fimshed and climbed out of the 
water, I was instantly enveloped by the 
her wmd and was soon dry. 

From the pool I went to Central 
Library where I lingered outside eating 
an brange, while I watched the wind 
carry the sunlight through the 
eucalyptus trees and splash it on the 
ground . Even inside on the seventh 
floor , my attention was continually 
distracted by the incessant swoon of the 
trees and the silver flash of a thousand 
leaves in the sun. 

There were a few weekend dates in 
U! Jolla , where dinner, with a luxurious 
sunset view of the ocean , was always 
followed by a night promenade with 
other laughing couples on the sidewalk. 
After watching the youthful breakers 
dance , those strolls would invanably end 
above the cove, where the wind -driven 
waves would simultaneously continue 
their timeless formanon of the cliffs and 
send spray intimately in our faces . 

One fall night two pretty friends and I 
found o urselves lost in the wind and 
rain as we searched for a party 
somewhere in the web of streets that is 
Univers ity City or Clalremont. After a 
maddemng, but hilanous hour, we 
found the party, and were among the 
seven who stayed, talking late I ntO the 
mght, warmed by the lire , the feelIng 01 

friendship and the thought of the cold 
blOWing outside. 

The sky was clear one breezy winter 
aftp.rnoon when I went to my two 
o'clock class. When I emerged at four, 
tropical clouds had sudderuy appeared, 
and an urgent wind cracked the trees 
and sent incipient soft, warm raindrops 
to the frantic-moving campus. 

My next class lasted until six, but it 
afforded an anxious view of the gray 
curtain of rain advancing across the 
ocean. We were dismissed, finally, into 
a downpour, and I was initiated into a 
completely soaked but unexpectedly 
joyous bike ride home. At nine that 
night, I opened my door to the wind 
and a clear sky - the storm had 
passed. 

One spring morning I pedaled my 
bike up Mt. Soledad , our local mountain , 
sprawled ~ut on the grass, and cooled 
off in the mountain breeze. I realized 
that the mountain wind is a pure~ wind , 
a wind that never sweeps down to the 
ground or is filtered through the trees . 

One has to climb a mountain to feel it. 
The stillest ti me of the year was the 

windy hour my tennis class practiced 
lobs. With the wind flOm off the ocean , 
the whole practice was orchestrated 
with a Western movement as the high-
sailing tennis balls curved west along 
with our ballet-like Sidesteps to position 
ourselves for the returns. 

Each tennis ball rose slowly to its 
summit where the wind held it for a still 
moment high above us before sending it 
crashing, curvi ng back to the earth with 
its fate . I felt something with my 
partner. It was the hushed way she and 
I followed the delicate course of each 
lob , the gende way we both made our 
returns, as if grieving to end the 
ephemeral beauty and communion 
between us. 

My partner and I were on the 
easternmost court, so by the end of the 
hour, half the balls from the other five 
courts had blown into ours. 

Of all the classes, all the panies, all 
the sunny days and aU the late nights, 
when sometimes it w,ould take hours to 
chase the ideas from my mmd before I 
could fall asleep, the wind chaUenged 
me the most. When I faced one windy 
dusk , the cloud purpled with the last 
remnants of light and leaping with 
power across the sky , the wind 
challenged me to acknowledge 
somethmg coupled With my spint.

Athletes of the Year 

Bill Kazmierowicz 
If Bill Kazmierowicz wore a jersey, his 

uniform number would probably be 
retired next year. As it is , the junior OUt 
of Mission Viejo has rewrittel" the UC D 
record book for swimming in his first 
year in the spon. 

Reluctant to join the UCSD swim 
team, Kazmierowicz elected to devote all 
his energy to the water polo team for 
tne past three seasons, and it has paid 
off. Uist year. the Tritons finished 
second in the Division 1I and 1II 
unsanctioned National Championships, 
and this year UC D won the title. 
Kazmierowicz was selected as the team's 
Most Valuble Player and was awarded 
All -American honors for the 'second year 
in a row as the team finished l3th 
ranked in the nation . His blazing water 
speed was, without question, the mai n 
reason why. 

At the conclUSion of the water polo 
season, Kazmierowicz decided to join 
the U D swim team , and coach Bill

Kazmierowicz established an NCAA

200 freestyle and 500 freestlye events. 

Kazmierowicz swam co!,)tinuously for 
ten years from the age of five with 
varioLls clubs and tearns including, at 
one point, the famed Natadors. Although 
Water polo has always been his first 
love , Kazmicrowicz can no longer keep

Louise Schwartz 
On November L8. 1983, Louise (Lulu) 

Schwa rtz became the firs t UCSD student 
many spon in the 25 year history of 
the university to have their uniform 
number retired. It was a brilliant ending 
to an equaUy bnlliant career. 

As a freshman in 1980, Schwanz was 
selected to the All-League se ond team 
and voted the volleybaU team's Most 
Valuable Player. 

With a year of experience sewn on 
her jersey, Schwanz returned as team 
captain in 1981 to lead the Tritons to their 
finest season ever. Teammg with hitter 
Tammy Smit, Schwanz and the Tritons 
won the National Championship m 
Pennsylva1l1a (the effon earned Smit and 
Schwanz UCSO Co-Athlete of the Year 
honors). Sc hwartz was named to three 
all-tournament teams and was elected 
as an All-American. 

In 1982, the TrItons carrIed the 
number one hational ranking through 
the entire season, and Schwanz racked 
up three more all-tournament team 
selections with her sparkling setting and 
defense . After wmning the Western 
Regionals in Wisconsm , the team came 
home to host the Nationals a t UCSD. 

The Tritons made it to the 
championship game for the second year 
m a row but were upset by U! Verne III 
the final. Still, the Pacific Palisades 
graduate was selected to the CM 
Nationals All-Tourney Team and earned 
All-American honors for the second 
consecutive year. 

In her senIor year, Schwanz was 
named to twO all- tournament tearns, 
giving her a total of eight all-tournament 
selections during her four year career 
as the Tritons again held the number 
one national ranking throughout the 
season. She guided the team to the 
finals for the third straight year where 
they Lost for the second time in a row. 
Schwartz became an All-American 
nominee for the third straight year to 
close out an illustrious career. 

In her four year Sllnt at UCSD, 
Schwanz had a superb .300 hitllng 
percentage, had over 3,000 aSSistS, and 
broke every school record m setting. She 
did everything for the promotion of the 
women's volleyball program that any 
one athlete could possibly do. For 1984 
UCSD Athlete of the Year, there could n't 
be a finer choice than Louise Schwanz .

This Team of the Week is for all those deseIVing teams who thought 
they should have been the Team of the Week. but weren't. Ute Beer 
and the Miller Brewing Company want to thank you all tor an 
excellent year of Intramurals. Have an enjoyable summer; we'll see 
you in September, 

Freeze pro 
contltl ucd from page 6 
Disannament Agency has publicly stated 
that "although the possibility of some 
undetected cheating in certain areas 
exists, such cheating would not alter the 
strategic balance in view of US 
programs. However, any cheating on a 
scale large enough to affect the strategic 
balance would be discovered in time to 
make an appropriate re?ponse." 
FUrlhermore. all previous allegations by 
the US of Soviet treaty violations since 
1972 have been resolved to the 
satisfaction of the US, 

In his article, Mr. Wolf leads us to 
believe that the Soviets will not agree to 
on-site inspections, This also is not true . 
The Soviets have agreed to on-site 
inspections in the context of the 
proposed Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty, which by definition IS mcluded 
in a nuclear freeze . 

What will happen if we do not 
institute a freeze? The US will continue 
to deploy Pershing II and Cruise 
Missiles in Western Europe . This will 
have at least three important and 
dangerous consequences. 

First of all. because the Pershing II is 
SIX mInutes away from Moscow, the 
Soviets have threatened to "launch on 
warning" if we continue deployment of 
these missiles. This means that they will 
fire their missiles in response to satellite 
wamings if they feel that this wamlng 
might be valid , and that they Will only 
have six minutes to detennine the 
validity of a warning. 

Secondly, further deployment of 
missiles and the refusal to negotiate a 
freeze WIll result in further Soviet 
deployments and further advances in 
Soviet technical sophisticatio~ . 

Finally, if Mr. Wolf is concerned 
about verification now, it becomes 
almost impossible once the Cruise 
Missile is deployed. A Cruise Missile is 
only 20 feet long, and can easily be 
hidden and transported. With this in 
mind , it suddenly becomes obvious that 

Decline 
conrinued from page 6 
expressions whether or not you are an 
honest man ," 

The same can be said of our experts 
in different specialties. When political 
scie ntists read a colleague's latest book, 
they are asking, "Is he still a member of 
our family?" more than, "Is this true?" 
That vociferous unwillingness among 
members of certain political persuasions 
to change their minds, to admit error, 
does not arise from stupidity. Ardent 
Marxists and capitalists cling to the 
purity of their systems so tightly because 
they need someth ing definite to believe 
in . 

Another. more popular example, is 
the public's tum to mass cultural events 
for a focus of spiritual unity, Think of 
Lord of the Rings and the Dune series of 
books, the phenomenal success of TV's 
Dallas, the public absorption wi th 
Spielberg and Lucas films - all have in 
common the willingness to offer the 
public worlds where good and evil are 
clearly delineated, Again, sp iritual needs 
are being dealt with here , where 
followers can lay claim to being part of a 
familY , 

What of those caught in between the 
experts and the mass public: the 
students? They are frequently accused of 
being lazy, self-centered and apatheti 
towards Issues. None of thiS can be 
denied. But a more interesting question 
IS to a k why thiS has occurred , for 
again , labelling attitudes does not 
explam them. Quite clearly, students are 
shOWing a recognition of Intellectual 
limits. They do not palllcipate m 
marches, or advocate polim:al reform 

Reagan '~ "ann to disann" policy is a 
rather transparent fraud, and that if we 
want to reduce nuclear weapons, we 
had better do it now, 

and con 
conrlnued from page 6 

Miss Chappell also leaves out the 
imporlance of other countries in her 
"discussion" of the freeze . When a 
country like China or India has missiles 
pointed at you, they need to be taken 
seriously. Are they to be included in the 
freeze also? 

Miss Chappe ll 's "discussion" of the 
nuclear close call s is at the very least a 
gross exaggerallon and unrealistic 
interpretation. The launching of nuclear 
missiles is not as simple as "turning the 
key," as Miss Chappell would like" ) 
believe, but is a very Involved pre 
safeguarded against error by hund 'J s 
of failsafes and procedures. The 
"flashing red light and siren" that she 
refers to is really a small pinlight and 
bleep sound that tell the operator he has 
something on his screen, Within 60 
seconds he can verity the nature of the 
bleep by contacting any or all stations 
throughout the country, And if we use 
the L,800 close calls number she quotes, 
this comes out to a 99.999995% (and 
getting better) accuracy rate for the 
decisions of the nuclear command 
center. 

On the economic issues of defense, 
Miss Chappell is beyond remedy. The 
50% figure quoted as the percentage of 
GNP spent on defe nse IS false and 
misleading. The correct figure IS 29')0, 
and most of that IS in the form of 
mili ta ry pay, which would not disappear 
in th e event of a nuclear freeze. but 
would most likely increase due to the 
necessity of a larger standing army. 

Miss Chappell's heart was in the right 
place when she wrote her commentary, 
but her logic and technique were in left 
field . Her article was one-sided, 
speculative, and assumed many myths 
while highlighting half-truths. 

along some definite lines, because ·f a 
vague sense that few theoretical 
standards remain by which 10 judge the 
world . There is a feeling that replacing 
one logical system with another is not 
worth the costs of time and effort 
involved, for it would not be any better. 

Thus we see the rejection of politics 
and philosophy as frivolous pursuits 
among students. They instinctively tum 
inwards 10 concemrate on their own 
lives instead - not realizing that this 
itself says something important 
philosophically, 

Which leads us back to J.D. Salinger, 
who partially grasped exactly this sta te 
of affairs , He stands nearly alone among 
the post-wa r novelists in being willing 10 
offer us some spiritual advice by which 
to lead our lives. 

After all, the Carcher in the Rye is an 
attempt to deal precisely with living in 
an age of no definite values. Holden 
Caulfield is a rebel against phoniness of 
an all-pervasive nature , a society that 
demands we unify and simplify life into 
logical strictures. "Some things you JUSt 
can't do that to," he says, The book's 
inCidents are a series of inSights, wuh 
Holden watching people behave as one-
man acts. People are living on raIse 
premises, and thereby excluding love 
and a sense of community from their 
lives. 

Salinger's work alone eannOt proVide 
a remedy to this breakdown of 
traditional va lues, but it does show us a 
world that is better than th is one. 1 he 
task of IOday's dramatists and fi ction 
Wnlers IS to carry on where he le ft ort 
20 years ago. It is imply not enough to 
capture life - they should seek 10 
transform It 100. by their literary 
examples. Past ages were able 10 recreate 
themselves by Imitating Urlistic exumpl e~ 
(which we still do every day) , and, With 
a sense of chrec[lun , so can our society.

Bob's Book Report 

Tbe ABC's of summer 
reading for students 

By IlOBfRT lLMf 
It Is now the time when mOst of the UCSD undergraduate 

population (and for that matter, everyone else) Is preparing for 
another round of that searing mental lmanlty called finals Week. 
I'd like to say good luck to all of you. I would also advise you to keep 
on reading during the summer. 

The definition of an educated person includes literacy. the ability 
to read and write. The very fact that you are going through (or have 
gone through) higher education means that you should be able to 
read and write WELL. Your skills have been developed to a high 
degree, they must not be allowed to atrophy. Use it or lose it. 

Read complete works by some of the philosophers you only read 
extracts of. Read some fiction with a philosophical message. 
(James Branch Cabell has written some ofthe most gonzo books In 
American literature, and people who say they know the message of 
figures of ~rth are usually wrong. People who say they know the 
meaning of Jurgen are not of this earth.) Read the Bible. Read The 
Journal o/Genetic Research. Read the phone book. But just keep 
on reading. 

Reading is. unfortunately. a very expensive activity. It requires 
considerable investment. both in expensive education, time. a good 
dictionary and adequate eye care. However. It does not require 
expensive electronics. large supplies of quarters. bus-fare to Vegas 
or a passport. 

That Is because reading Is Its own passport. visa to the Interior of 
someone else's mind, one of the least expensive and most useful 
means of Information dispersal. It also requires IItUe expense to 
obtain the materials. Used bookstores. public libraries (always a 
favored locale for obtaining such aged, out of print works as those 
of Cabell or fddlson). library sales and estate sales are always good 
places to get Inexpensive or tree books In this era of four buck 
papebacks. 

frUoY your summer reading.

In break dancing. which first 

began close to a dozen years ago 
with street gangs as a way to 
confront each other In a non· 
violent manner, the country's 
youth spoke out about their 
trials universally. Judging from 
the attention and success three 
movies relating to the subject 
have shared. the breakform has 
gradually united the feelings of 
those who have and have not 
been exposed to this art. new 
and old. and in mass quantities. 
The Idea of these movies Is that 
goal-plus-soul-equals-gold. and 
the response has been 
supportive. 

The f1gures disclosed by 
Hollywood studios last week 
show the movie IJreak;n ' as the 
second highest grossing movie. 
pulling In $17.9 million gross 
over three weeks. It Is the first of 
three ~or motion pictures to 
screen In San Diego devoted to 
the street-dance scene. The film. 
cUrected by Joel Silberg. traces 
the lives of two prominent 
young breakers. Rodolpho and 
Turbo (their adopted break 
dance names), and of the 
beautiful wclnda Dickey, a 
waitress aspiring to be a 
professional dancer. 

Loosely related to I"lash-
dance. the story revolves 
around the meeting of this trio. 
the growing Interest In fonnlng 
a breaking crew. and 
auditioning for a meUor dance 
show. The low budgeted 
production excells In 
presenting an authentic 
representation of breaking. 
rather than fabricated, using 
popular, earthy songs like The 
Art of !'folse's "Beat Box." Chaka 
Khan's "Aln·t !'fobody" and the 
Bar-Kay's "l'reak5how." and WIS 
shot on location In the street50f 
Los Angeles. 

The pace 15 carried by the 
well-cast troupe. all of whom 
share similar lives to the ones 
portra)'td. and the director's 
abillty to work around their 
problem of little acting 
experience. Turbo (pla)'td by 
Boogal ~ Shrimp) turns In the 
best performance. utilizing his 
ability to Improvise. 

The breaking In the movie Is 
fantastic. complemented by the 
cinematography. and a tribute 
to the dance fonn's growth. The 
routines are varied and original. 

Evidence of IJreak/n's 
widespread popularity Is Its 
appeal to a variety of ages and 
races. felix Prince. a record 
buyer for Ucorlce Pizza and 
local disc jockey. says, "It 15 
phenomenal that not only Is the 
record being bought by the 
teenagers, but It sells great to 
older audiences too." Prince 
explains that breaking has 
caught the attention of both the 
black and white record buyers • 

and says that It Is a link of 
expression that unlnes both 
races'tastes. "You have to give 
credit to Malcolm Mclaren and 
the Sex Pistols first for bringing 
the traditional black market to 
the white man's ears. Breaking 
has blossomed all over the 
world ever since these two 
broke ground." 

Breaklng's relative infancy 
has already fascinated and 
graced the likes of the Kennedy 
Center Honors, In which a 
performance for the gala 
received a standing ovation. and 
the DIrK:e Theater of Harlem 
which begins each show with a 
break routine. Hoping to 
capitalize on this accepted 
craze are two other movies 
premiering locally this month. 
Bat Street. directed by stan 
Lathan. Is the better known of 
the two. Produced by Hany 
Belafonte. with a larger budget 
than Break;n', the Him takes 
place in !'few York City. and 
features an all-original 
soundtrack. with cuts by Afrika 
Blmbaataa and the Soulsonlc 
force. Jenny Burton. Grand-
master flash. Cindy Mitchell 
and The System. &"t Street 
opens tomorrow nationwide 
with appearances by the 
finalists of a m.,r breaking 
contest, The befttthlC1 title ofthe 

promotion Is "Ain't no stopping 
us now," and with a better plot 
than IJreaJcin ~ /Jeat Street might 
just achieve that state. 

Appearing on a limited 
engagement from July U-19.at 
the Ken Cinema Is Wild Style. 
which promises to be the most 

accurate documentary of the 
three. Directed by Charlie Ahem 
and with music by cttrls Stein of 
Blondle fame. the movie 
dramatizes the lives of New 
York's gangs who let out their 
agresslons by breaking, and of 
those people who make a living 

from hlp-hop music's Industry. 
I'Iow that It has generated -

enough interest to be 
recognized as a legitimate new 
type of dance. UCSD will no 
doubt soon be offering breaking 
courses. txposure to this form 
requires minimal effort. 

According to Mike l'Iepomu-
ceno. the man in charge of 
UCSO's own "Bogus Breakers," 
between 60-80% of the students 
here have demonstrated an 
Interest In breakdancing for Its 
health and fttness appeal. One 
develops a great shape. says 
Nepomuceno, through the 
movements of breaking. "It·s 
more like wrestling than dance 
- a lot of concentration and 
free-flowing like aerobics." 

UCSD 's Dance Program 
coordinator and department 
director Margaret Marshall says 
that breaking Is stili In Its fad 
stance. like ballroom dancing. 
needing a IItUe more time 
before It can be offered as a 
class like tap or jazz. But she 
says for the Immediate moment 
breaking has weaved its way 
Into the program around the 
bureaucracy of the school 
system. It (breaking) Is here and 
we are teaching It already In our 
jau and tumbling classes, to 
over one-third, or JO() of our 
stUdents. Our choreography 
class has. as have our 
professionals, begun learning 
it." 

Marshall says that hopefully 
beginning next fall a non-credlt 
course with complete emphasis 
on breaking will be taught by an 
expert. To all dance students 
who would like to partake In 
this Instruction. keep your eyes 
open, for registration dates, for 
this promises to be one of the 
hottest classes of next year.

Johnson explains, "If the Kid 
had to compete against others 
who had trained for years In the 
disciplines and philosophies 
that Mlyagl taught him, he 
would not have a chance. But he 
was competing against the 
Cobras who were taught strictly 
on the physical level. Since the 
Kid was trained also on the 
mental, he actually had the 
advantage. The audience usually 
relates to the physically 
advanced. But the Kid went far 
beyond that. He was in a 
different state of mind, a 
different state of being." 

Kid is a serious presentation of Although there were martial

Beyond the cinema, Johnson 
feels, "One of the main 
problems with the martial arts 
In this country is that the 
Americans cannot relate to 
them in the distinct way an 
Oriental can. In the Orient. to sit 
under a winter waterfall or take 
a longjoumey can have no other 
purpose than the development 
of self discipline. In America, 
when people want to do 
something, like stop smoking, 
they do not have the self 
discipline to do so. They may 
start, but as soon as the pressure 
builds, they return to their 
former undisciplined ways: '

Bruce Lee as a fighter in fnter

Johnson describes what he 
hopes will change the Image of 
martial arts portrayed In the 
cinema: " When the master 
Miyagl first rescues the Kid from 
the Cobras he says, 'Depend on 
reason: The Kid responds, 
'How's revenge?' The audience 
reacts strongly to this scene 
because they can all relate to 
revenge, but this is diametrical-

Iy opposed to the true 
philosophy of karate. Then the 
transformation from this 
attitude occurs In the boat 
scene when Mlyagi Is fishing and 
the Kid is practicing while 
standing on the rails on the bow 
ofthe boat. Miyagi asks the Kid, 
'Why learn karate? ' The kid 
answers, "So I won ·t have to 
fight:" 

The movie stresses the old 
methods of slow, methodic 
discipline in study, yet the Kid is 
able to confront his opponents 

Johnson explained how he 
relates to karate in his life and 
what he tried to communicate 
In the movie. "Karate Is a 
method of galning confidence 
in yourself and your abilities so 
that you can face everyday life 
with the idea you will be 
victorious In whatever endeavor 
you undertake. Karate gives you

'Alice Malice' at UCSD 
Because Lewis carroll isn't for little girls, 
little girls are for Lewis carroll 

By SnPIIArUf DAVIDSM 
Alice "'alice Is an exhibition 

by Carol Mavor, a UCSO visual 
arts graduate student. of IIve-
size sculptures of anthropo-
morphic characters, drawing 
accompanied by texts and an 
architectural piece containing 
photographs of what Mavor calls 
the "Vlctorlal secrets" of lewis 
Carroll, who manifested what 
was a characteristic obsession 
of that age - an obsession with 
little girls. 

Tomorrow at 7 pm, Mavor will 
present a performance art piece 
which analyzes Carroll's 
relationship, and fascination, 
with little girls. Immediately 
following the performance, a 
"Mad Tea Party" celebrating 
everyone's "unbirthday" will 
commence. 

Mavor's artistic inspiration 
draws from her reading about 
the cult of the little girl 
represented in "lolita" and 
reflected In the lives of men like 
Carroll. Her own penchant for 
drawing fantasy renditions of 
characters which display both 
human and bestial aspects has 

blossomed In her work where 
she has "tried to use the duality 
of his (Carroll's) characters. She 
says, "He used a mixture of 
saccharine sweetness with the 
horrific and the sensual," 
Although Mavor draws her 
imagery from a vivid 
imagination, she also attempts 
to present. through her work, a 

deeper understanding to convey 
the psychological Implications 
of Carroll 's Alice In Wonderland. 

To Mavor, there Is an 
underlying violence In the Alice 
books which she illustrates by 
portraying her characters with 
rifles, bared teeth and 
telescopes that hint at lewis 
carroll's voyeuristic tendencies. 

Alice In Alice in Wonderland Victorian women not so much as

Technology and science make 
for an interesting dance mix 

By CHRISTOPHfR CArlOU: 
Our society obsessively 

craves spec la I effects 
entertainment. from Michael 
Jackson's electrifying dance 
video "Thriller" to the latest 
episodes of Trek and Indy. It 
comes as no surprise then that a 
science and technology 
university such as UCSO would 
present a dance concert 
dominated by special effects. 
Though our dance department Is 
gaining credibility, one does 
not expect to see perfectly 
controlled form and choreo-
graphy from AMfS, ffCS, 
bioengineering, business and 
physics m~s.

delightful discoveries was a

"Tarantella" took us even 
further back Into pre-science 
with a pleasant peasant dance. 

Then to show the audience 
the power and energy that can 
be attained in dance without 
overpowering special effects, 
"Drums of Passion" pulsated 
tribal rhythms, vibrating 
throughout the audience which 
may have recognized move-

Bringing a 
little 'China' 
to the states 

ByJOH" "ff 

happening," When asked about 
the status of China Crisis on 
British radio. Daly responded 
enthusiastically, " I think that 
that's how we've manas..ed to 
survive as long as we have. 
although we haven't had that 
much success. We have been 
successful with the W's." 

There always seems to be 
something lacking In a sequel 
to a movie. 1"10 matter how good 
or bad the second generation of 
a piece Is. It very rarely has the 
Impact of the first. This. 
however. has nothing to do with 
the success that a pr*ct will 
achieve. Musically. the same 
holds true. While all music 
being produced today. save for 
the most avant-garde. has 
traceable roots to other bands. 
there are few prqjects which 
reflect a sense of originality. 
creativeness and intelligence In 
the work they are doing. The 
crime is very common. Simply. 
too many bands sound like very 
poor imltlatlons of other bands. 
What is missing is having a 
group sound like itself. With 
this in mind, it is hard to 
compare a group such as China 
Crisis with anything else as they 
do not really sound like 
anything else currently on the 
market. except perhaps 
themselves. 

Udle Lundon and Gary DIlly of Cblna CrIsis wbo wli be In town OIl JuDe 16 at lite rox n.e.tre. 

Tearing Otlna Crisis down to 
the bare minimum to the core of 
creativity, we nnd only fddle 
Lundon and Garry Daly 
remaining. The songs for the 
albums were co-<:omposed by 
Lundon and Daly, while the 
~Ity of the lyrics were 
written only by Daly. On the 
world of poetry and how It 
meshes with music, Daly added, 
'The processes of writing the 
music and the words for the 
songs are quite separate. I don't 
write words to spedftcally go 
with a song. 1 find myself writing 
lyrics all the time." WhIle this is 
definitely a creative process, 
Daly does not see this as 
necessarily being poetic: "It's 
not really being poetic. I 
wouldn't really know how to do 
that." 

Not much has been heard or 
seen of China Crisis in the 
United States. Sometime this 
past summer, Warner Records 
envelopes with the first China 

Crisis single, " Working with fire 
and Stee\''' began to trickle 
onto radio stations across the 
country. As with most first 
projects in the US. It was not an 
overwhelming success in terms 
of airplay except on college and 
progreslve stations. More 
recently, China Crisis has 
released a fuli album entitled 
Working With fire and Steel 
(Possible Pop Songs Volume 
Two) . This is the group's second 
project, except for a few 
independent releases, The first, 
DiffiCUlt Shapes and Passive 

Rhythms, Some People Think 
It's fun to lntertain, is 
available only on the British 
label Virgin, 

Last year China Crisis was on 
the Simple Minds' New Golden 
Dream tour as a support act In 
Europe, Currently, the band is 
being carried through both the 
European and North American 
tours, At the time of the 
interview for this piece. the 
band members had been In the 
Unltid States for a short while. 
and thus were uncertain about 
what type of reception they 

would get. While this renWns to 
be seen, one canjudge the level 
of success they will achieve 
from the strength that they have 
developed In Britain. According 
to Daly, China Crisis has gone 
over very well in fngland In a 
popular sense but not so far as 
with the British press. "In 
Britain we got really terrible 
press. The situation with the 
press Is really a lot like that of 
television. There are only three 
or four major papers In l'..ngland. 
It's a real hierarchy, and they 
control a lot of what's 

Though It is a band which 
relies heavily on the use of 
synthesizers, It Is quite 
surprising to note the 
Influences of the band, said 
Daly. "fddie is really into stevie 
Wonder and David Bowie. I'm 
into Brian fno and things like 
that." In this light. it Is possible 
to venture that China Crisis Is 
developing a new style as 
opposed to deriving an old one. 

The Psychedelic furs are on the 'Mirror Moves' 
8y RODDY BOOAWA 

What is the new mood in pop 
music today? I would say 
Optimism and Hope. in spite of 
all the depressing drab politics 
and fear of it all ending with the 
big Final Bang (I), With their 
new release on CBS, l'firror 
Moves, The Psychedelic Furs 
skip the groove and tum back 
the clock to a time when music 
was hopeful. The Furs. along 
with the Style Council. join a 
host of new music which looks 
forward to uniting people in 
optimism and strength to take 
hold of the Moment. This music 
seems to reflect society much 

more than music of the '70s, 
while also tryiug to move 
people again. Less naive than in 
the '60s. however, maybe the 
difference is the fear in 
everyone's mind that someone 
may decide to throw the final 
party, 

l'firror l'foves Is a more 
appealing record to mainstream 
audiences than the previous 
albums. but the power in 
Richard Butler's voice or the 
colors of the band is still here, 
One thing that has always 
amazed me about the Furs is 
that they put out records which 
you can never get tired of 

listening to. You may love or 
hate them, but they put out 
great records. Overcoming the 
shadows of Lou Reed and the 
Velvets scene they were first 
associated with, the Furs have 
come into their own. They sound 
simploy how The Psychedelic 
Furs should sound. Richard 
Butler's vocals are so droning 
and repetitive, but you can 
listen to him over and over and 
over again . Psychedelic 
hypnosis therapy for under ten 
dollars is a bargainl 

The singles from the LP. 'The 
Ghost In You" and "Heaven," 
along with the cuts "Uke a

Summer Concerts 
An outstanding line-up of concerts Is 

scheduled for San Diego this summer and 
UCSD will host the opening show this 
friday. The Bus Boys, who played to an 
enthusiastic crowd In the gym last year, 
will headline this year's TGiO. The 
festivities begin with the "New" four ~es 
at 4 pm on the hump, Do not miss this 
under any circumstance, this Is why we go 
to UCSO. 

Also tomorrow the eclectic King

Mangione, Spyro Gyra, B.B. King, 

From AUGUST 6 - AUGUST 24, the UCSD Libraries will reduce

the manual circulation systems.

controlled, It often lacks 
spontaneity. Such was the case 
with "Sentimental Rationale," 
This foursome obviously had 
talent beyond the music 
selection and choreography. 

Though I may be known as a 
lover of capes, too many can 
overshadow the dancers, as was 
evident In "Las Matadoras." 

The excellent choreography 
projected far better than the 
slide graphics of "Ron's 
Passage," 

Once again the ballerina 
demonstrated the blend of 
precision and art in "Spring 
Water," during which the 
audience had become aware of 
the complexity of movement so 
well executed. 

The next two dances, "Solid 
Colors" and "Shopping," stood 
out as the grand performances 
of the evening, coordinating 
excellent choreography, 
graphics, stage design and 
music. Dancer Julie Thompson 
radiated In both performances, 
sharing with the audience the 
thrill of the moment that comes 
after months of hard training. 

The final dance, "Riot in 
Lagos," had many fine 
performers. Unfortunately, they 
were all masked. But the 
anonymity of the masks added 
to the quality of presentation. 

Once again, the UCSD 
fvening of Dance was a sellout, 
and this year's performances 
will surely bring the audience 
back next year for another lively 
evening •
