Sacramento student Craig 
Rogers has filed a sexual 
harassment complaint with the 
State Board of Control seeking 
$2.5 million from the state for 
the mental anguish, pain,

claims he suffered in Joanne 
Marrow's guest lecture to his

advocated masturbation, 
showed pictures of young

Chancellor Supports Women's Center 
CENTER: Atkinson 
favors creation of 
university-funded center 
By Marianne Vigil 
News Editor 

After 20 years of lobbying by 
students and faculty, Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson declared his sup-
port for a proposal to establish a 
fully funded women's center on 
campus at an Academic Senate meet-
ing last week. UCSD is currently the 
only University of California cam-

pus that does not have a university-
funded and permanently staffed 
women's center. The existing 
Women's Resource Center (WRC) 
receives funding only from the A.S. 
and is run completely by volunteers. 

Atkinson's support came in re-
sponse to a recommendation sub-
mitted to him by Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affai rs Marjorie Caserio. 
Caserio made informal inquiries into 
the nature of other universities' 
women's centers and concluded that 
UCSD is not currently providing 
comparable services. 

In her report, Caserio recom-
mended "the development of a 
Women's Center be given every 
consideration with respect to mis-
sion, organization, staffing, loca-
tion and budgetary support." She 
suggested the center should, at a 
minimum, include a permanent di-
rector and two or more support staff. 
In addition, Caserio suggested 
Building 202 a a potential location 
for the new center. The dean of 
social sciences, the current occu-
pant of this office space, will be 
relocating to the new Social Science 

Building after its completion. 
The administration has not yet 

discussed the amount of funding it 
will allocate to this project, but 
Caserio wrote, "the typical funding 
level is around $200,000 in salaries 
and support" at other universities. 

Linde Negata from the 
Chancellor's office said Chance!-
lor Atkinson is supportive of the 
concept of a women 's center and 
that he concurs with all of Case rio's 
recommendations.

San Diego Beaches 
Closed by Pollution 

Crews Fill Cracks as the Ground 
Under RIMAe Continues to Sink 

HEALTH: Officials warn 
residents of high bacteria levels 
By DOUI Alexander 
Senior Staff Writer 

With recent storms washing millions of gal-
lons of sewage and urban pollution into the 
ocean, large chunks of San Diego coastline 
remain quarantined today, and authorities are 
warning residents to avoid swimming, surfing 
and other water recreation off San Diego shores. 

Heavy rains in the last week flooded storm 
drains and waterways, and pushed numerous 
sewage-treatment centers beyond capacity, re-
sulting in massive sewage runoff into the ocean. 

The San Diego County Department of Envi-
ronmental Health (SDCDEH) has posted warn-
ing signs on the shoreline stretching from the 
international border to the tip of North Island in 
Coronado. San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and a 
number of areas in North County areas have 
also been closed down.

EROSION: Fissures in steps 
prompt continuation of repairs 
begun last October 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

Problems continue to plague the new Recre-
ational/Intramural Activity Complex (RIMAC) 
as construction crews began repairs Tuesday to 
fill in gaps caused by soil erosion beneath the 
$32 million sports facility. Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor of Facilities, Design and Construction 
Boone Hellmann said the repairs are a continu-
ation of similar work which was completed last 
October when the contractor, Moran Construc-
tion, discovered that soil beneath the founda-
tion had sunk three to six inches. The present 
resealing work is an attempt to counter the 
damage caused by the erosion. 

Cracks in tlTe large steps outside the north-
west comer of RIMAC prompted officials to 
investigate for further erosion a few weeks ago.

Global Warming 
Threatens Plankton 
OCEAN: Numbers of zooplankton, the basis of the 
aquatic food chain, have been declining since the '70s 
By Ben EI"n isolated. " 
Senior Staff Writer 

. Global warming may be damag-
ing the base of the ocean's food 
chain, therefore posing a threat to 
all ocean life, according to a recent 
study by UCSD's Scripps Institu-
tion of Oceanography. 

This lack of oceanic circulation 
fortes vital nutrients to deeper lev-
els, making them inaccessible to the 
surface-dwelling zooplankton, ac-
cording to the researchers 

"Increased stratification means 
that wind-driven upwelling is be-

The number of 
zooplankton, tiny 
creatures that live 
near the surface of 
the ocean, have de-
clined by 80 percent 
off the Southern 
California coast 
over the last 42 
years. 

Zooplankton 
provide sustenance 
for many fish in-
cluding anchovies, 
sardines and mack-
erel. Tonnage of 
commercial fish 
landed in California 
has been declining 
since the 1970s. 

"The food web is 
very complicated," 
said study co-author 
John McGowan.

manifestation of 
chang. due to 
man, then there 
la every reason 
to believe that It 
will continue 

coming relatively 
less efficient in lift-
ing deep waters," 
said co-author Dean 
Roemmich. "In_ 
stead, shallower 
waters are being 
lifted to the sea sur-
face and those shal-
lower waters have 
less nutrients in 
them." 

"Almost all species and Intensify." 

Data from a 
SO,OOO-square-m i1e 
area between San 
Diego and Point 
Conception ruled 
out natural trends as 
the cause of the 
climbing sea tem-
peratures . While 
brief fluctuations in 
temperature have 
occurred in the past, 
scientists believe 
the magnitude and 
duration of this shift 

of fish are goi ng to 
be affected one way 
or another." 

-Dean Roemmich 
Scripps Researcher 

sets it apart. 
While Scripps researchers can-

not prove global warming is the 
cause of the diminishing population 
of zooplankton, they suspect that it 
is the culprit. . 

According to the California Co-
operative Oceanic Fisheries Inves-
tigations, ocean surface tempera-
tures have climbed by two to three 
degrees Fahrenheit in Southern Cali-
fornia since 1951. This temperature 
increase establishes a steep gradient 
between the ocean's surface tem-
perature and its colder depths, which 
contain many of the nutrients upon 
which zooplankton feed. 

"There is much more stratifica-

"If what we are seeing here is a 
manifestation of change due to man, 
then there is every reason to believe 
that it will continue and intensify," 
Roemmich said. 
. Whether or not global warming 
is the cause, the Scripps study pro-
vides a legitimate oceanic scenario 
forthe future of Southern California 
marine life should signs of the green-
house effect continue to manifest 
itself. 

"If there is a global temperature 
rise of one to two degrees Celsius 
[1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheitl in 
the next 40 years ... the biological 
impacts could be devastating," the 

tion," said McGowan. "The warm Scripps scientists stated in Science 
water becomes warmer and more Journal. 

POLLUTION: 
Continued from pa,. 1 

Last week, 9.5 million gallons of 
sewage spilled into Rose Canyon 
Creek, which outpours into Mission 
Bay. In North County, an estimated 
10 million gallons of sewage was 
discharged into Escondido Creek, 
which runs into the ocean at Cardiff 
State Beach; and an estimated 1.5 
million gallons of sewage was 
spilled into the San Luis Rey River, 
which outlets in Oceanside. 

George McCandless, program 

manager of field operations at 
SDCDEH, said testing indicates wa-
ter has improved in some area, but 
not others. "We did spot checking 
yesterday morning and some [pollu-
tion levels] are very, very high and 
some are moderate, " he said. 

But the pollution of San Diego 
waters may only worsen, as a large 
storm is likely hit San Diego this 
afternoon or early tomorrow. 

"With the upcoming storm, if it 
has the intensity that is reported, it is 
expected that things will only get 
worse," said McCandless.

UClA to Meet on Campus to 
Dlacu .. F ... , Affirmative Action 

The University of California Student Union (UCSA) 
will hold its monthly Board of Directors meeting at 
UCSD on March 11 and 12 to discuss fee increases, 
the Smith v. Regents decision, affirmative action and 
other issues. 

On Saturday from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m., UCSA's 
standing committees will meet and discuss future 
UCSA action. The Affirmative Action Committee will 
discuss UC affirmative action policies, hate crimes 
and the Civil Rights initiative. The Fees and Financial 
Aid Committee will discuss plans to solidify itspolicies 
on financial aid, graduate financial aid and mandatory 
health insurance. The Student Life and Concerns 
Committee will discuss domestic partnerships in stu-
dent housing, graduate student unionization and a 
chil<k:are update. 

The main topic for discussion on Sunday will be the 
Smith v. Regents decision beginning at 1 p.m. The 
Smith decision has been interpreted by the UC regents 
to mean student groups cannot directly lobby the State 
Legislature. UCSA's discussion will involve its inter· 
pretation of the decision and its challenge to the 
regents. 

ScrIpps Geophysics Profeuor 
Ru ..... Raitt DI .. at ~e 87 

Professor Emeritus of geophysics Russell W. Raitt 
died of heart failure Monday, March 6. Raitt, 87, was 
affiliated with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
for over 50 years. 

Raitt, a pioneer in geophysiCS, was among the first 
to successfully adapt seismic techniques used for oil 
exploration on land to shipboard measurements of the 
earth's crust beneath the seafloor. He made the first 
measurements of the thickQess of the crust beneath 
the PacifIC Ocean and discovered the unusual struc· 
ture of the East PacifIC Rise, the largest topographical 
feature in the oceans. 

Raitt's work helped define the structure and evolu-
tion of the deep ocean bottom. He was a key partici· 
pant in ocean surveys in the 19505 and 1960s, which 
were central to development of the theories of seaf-
loor spreading and plate tectonics. 

"Russell Raitt was a seagoing scientist in the finest 
sense: Innollatlve, tireless and able to improvise 
methods when equipment failure, weather or an un-
suitable ocean floor made work difficult," said Raitt's 
colleague Robert Fisher. 

Raitt was born Sept. 30, 1907, in Philadelphia and 
received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees in phys-
ics from the California Institute of Technology. He 
researched underwater acoustics for the University of 
California's Division of War Research in San Diego 
during World War II and joined Scripps after the war.

WOMEN: 
Continued from paee 1 
comments from various student, 
staff and faculty organizations. Ac-
cording to Negata, an advisory com-
mittee will be formed to draw up a 
proposal for the center after Atkinson 
receives responses. 

According to A.S. President 
Carla Tesak, the Associated Stu-
dents Co~ncil voted unanimously 
for the creation of a women 's cen-
ter. However, the A.S. stipulated 
that "undergraduate students pay. a 
proportional amount of the fund-
ing," Tesak added . 

In a letter to Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph Watson, 
Tesak stated that a major concern is 
fiscal burden of the center on under-
graduates. Tesakstated that she feels 
that the recommended center will 
benefit the graduate students , staff 
and faculty more than undergradu:' 
ates. 

Tesak also stated that she would 
li ke the issue put to a student vote. 
"If Student Affairs is going to be 
financially responsible for any part 
of the budget for a women 's center, 
it is imperative that the students 
vote on it ... students have the right 
to not only know, but also decide if 
that is where they want their money 
spent," she stated. • 

The WRC, which has lobbied the 
administration for years for fund-
ing, said it is very supportive of the 
administration's move toward cre-
ating a university-funded center. 
"We're very excited about this," 

RIMAe: 
Continued from pace 1 
"We had some evidence of soil sub-
sidence, so we're continuing with 
grouting in the voids," Hellmann 
said. 

The repairs include replacing a 
damaged water main and a process 
called "pressure grouting," in which 
a mixture of concrete and slate is 
injected into the cracks. 

According to Hellmann, the prob-
lems are most likely caused by mis-
takes made by the original contrac-
tor, Moran Construction. "We think 
that the ground wasn" compacted 
properly, combined with early 
rains," he said. 

He added that, while it is diffi-
cult to determ i ne the exact source of 

said WRC volunteer Tram Nguyen. 
"This center has been 19 years in the 
making. 

Nguyen said students and staff 
have made similar proposals in the 
past, but they have never received 
the support which was given to 
Caserio's recommendation. "There 
was a time when the administration 
wasn't willing to listen. But, now, 
the political climate is right and the 
proper pressure has been exerted," 
she said. 

According to Nguyen, the WRC 
was not notified about the 
administration's support for a cen-
ter until this week, but she said she 
hopes that the volunteers in the WRC 
will have a greater role in the forma-
tion of the advisory committee. 

"Our concern is about the level 
of commitment [of the administra-
tion] to the undergraduate students 
who have done a majority of the 
work. We' re looking forward to 
working with the administration on 
the vision." 

The WRCoffers both educational 
and cultural programs to students, 
faculty and staff as well as support 
and network opportunities. Recent 
programs have include rape-preven-
tion workshops, discussions on 
women's health and abuse victims 
support groups. 

Nguyen said she looks forward 
to having a permanent staff and a 
central location for women's ser-
vices. "As it is now, I'm referring 
people all over campus aQd it's just 
crazy." 

The creation of a university-

the problem, photos taken two years 
ago during the initial construction 
phase showed major water infiltra-
tion during periods of heavy rains. 

"We maintain that.it is the 
contractor's responsibility to make 
sure that the site and construction 
are protected from water infiltra-
tion," Hellman said. The contrac-
tors had to begin emergency repairs 
on large voids and broken water 
mains before RIMAC's opening in 
January. 

Hellmann said he believes the 
recent repairs, which are being done 
by a different contractor, 
Geotechnical Stabilization,lnc., will 
correct the problem. 

The total cost of repairs made to 
RIMAC is estimated between 
$250,000 and $500,000, according 

The UCSD Guardian 

funded center has been along-stand-
ing issue in the WRC. For the last 
five years, WRC volunteers have 
sent thousands of signed petitions to 
the administration titled, "Why 
Doesn ' t UCSD Have a Funded 
Women 's Center?" The fliers begin 
by stating, "I am appalled at the lack 
of attention to the needs of women 
on the UCSD campus." 

In addition, the Committee on 
the Status of Women, which was 
established by the Chancellor's Of-
fice several years ago, submitted a 
proposal for a women's center in 
1992, but it did not receive adminis-
tration support. 

According to Caserio, the ad-
ministration has previously objected 
to funding a women's center with 
reasons such as "budgetary re-
straints; all special interest groups 
will argue for a center; services such 
as oounseling ... are provided through 
other venues; and women faculty 
and staff would not utilize the cen-
ter." 

"The first two arguments have 
lost credibility as a result of the 
formation of the Cross-Cultural 
Center," Caserio stated in her rec-
ommendation. 

In response to the argument that 
the services of a women '5 center are 
already provided, Caserio wrote, 
"The criticism we hear is that the 
decentralized organization of cam-
pus services is a frustration and de-
terrent to women - that this frag-
mentation could be compensated for 
through a dedicated Women's Cen-
ter." 

to Hellmann. He added the current 
repairs are minor and won't be ex-
pensive. 

Hellmann said the administra-
tion is working on an agreement 
with Moran Construction to pay for 
the repairs. "We're doing the work 
against the contract that we already 
have [with Moran Construction]," 
he said. 

However, Moran Construction 
denied UCSD's claim of defective 
construction, in an Oct. 3 letter sent 
to the UCSD Director of Architec-
ture and Project Management Rob-
ert. 

Moran Co!lstruction must file a 
claim with the university if it wants 
to recoup repair costs. 

Moran Construction could not 
be reached for comment.

Women's Center May 
Finally Receive Funding 

If you have walked through the Old Student Center, you may 
have noticed the tiny room next to Soft Reserves which houses 
UCSD's understaffed, underrepresented and underfinanced 
Women 's Resource Center (WRC). Though virtually ignored by 
the university, WRC provides such vital services as rape educa-
tion and prevention, sexual harassment information, counseling 
and a variety of community outreach, volunteer and cultural 
programs. 

The women 's centers at all of the other UC campuses receive 
funding of approximately $200,000 per year, a permanent staff 
and office space, which includes libraries and conference rooms. 

However, the WRC has no permanent budget or staff. It 
survives only through the efforts of student volunteers. Last year, 
the WRC's total funding (all of which comes from the A.S.) was 
a lillie over $2,000, .which was supposed to cover all program-
ming and operating costs. Not surprisingly, the center constantly 
struggles to maintain its hours and services. 

Although the Commillee on the Status of Women had pro-
posed establishing a fully funded women 's center at UCSD over 
two years ago, Chancellor Richard Atkinson is only now, after 
years of controversy, supporting the idea - perhaps because he 
is vying for the position of UC president. But the point is the 
administration is finally recognizing UCSD's need for a univer-
sity-funded women's center. 

However, the question remains as to who would fund tbe 
WRC. Some of tbe centers at other UC campuses are funded 
solely by student fees. At UCSD, the WRC would most likely be 
funded by Academic Affairs, Student Affairs and Business 
Affairs. Nevertheless, the A.S. will press for a student vote on the 
mailer. And rigbtfully so. If the administration decides tbat 
students should pay for tbe entire development and operation of 
tbe center, students sbould certainly have the right to vote on it. 

A fully funded Women's Resource Center is long overdue. 
While gender inequalities are certainly less sharp today than they 
were in tbe past, sexism is still prevalent - even in "enlightened" 
communities sucb as UCSD. Providing support, outreach and 
education, a well-funded, centralized WRC is critical not only to 
women at UCSD, but to the community as a wbole. 

Campus ute Bill Is a Hefty 
PrIce to Pay for 'Unity' 

Overshadowed by its powerhouse sister campuses to tbe north, 
UC Berkeley and UCLA, UC San Diego is perennially tagged as 
California's "up and coming university," which is just about - but 
not quite - poised to join the coveted list of America's "best." 
Though the gap really appears to be narrowing, with murmurs here 
and there about UCSD overtaking Berkeley in some of the sciences, 
some contend the campus still lacks one major component of a 
great university: sports. In particular, football. 

Perbaps feeling so deprived, a consortium of student leaders, 
backed by the A.S. and the administration, has drafted the 
Campus Life Bill, which would, among other things, provide 
funding for a long-dreamed Triton footballtearn . Currently 
making its way around campus to win the 3,500 signatures it 

"!leas to be placed on the A.S. Spring Election ballot, the bill 
boldly promises to enliven UCSD and build community. 

''There is no allegiance to this university because basically, 
most alumni didn't enjoy coming here," said Interfraternity 
Council (IFC) President and bill co-author Greg Hearn. "This 
school needs some kind of unity - whether through athletic 
programs or other programs." 

While one might quibble with Hearn 's saccharine concept of 
unity, establishing a football team may seem like a swell idea. But 
here's the rub: Like UCSD's $32 million, 188,OOO-square-foot 
athletic center, RIMAC, the money would come directly out of 
students' already empty pockets. The Campus Life Bill would 
raise the Student Activity Fee, currently $13.50 per quarter, to $43 
per quarter. Tally the $70 per-quarter RIMAC cover charge, and 
students would pay over $350 per year in UCSD specialty fees. 

While student sports and entertainment are important to college 
life, in this era of austerity and skyrocketing tuition, this "nickel 
and diming" of students is nothing less than foul. The crisis in 
higher education is only going to intensify in the next decade, 
taking its toll on both access and quality. Yet, our student leaders, 
though surely well-meaning, are fighting to implement a fee to 
make our college experiences more "fun." The regents must be 
pleasantly amused. Ripping the shirts off our backs, indeed.

AMERICA NEEDS To PART 
WIlH ITS RACIST PAST 

COMMENTARY: Dismissing affirmative action as unfair ignores the 
historic oppression which people of color have endured

we should be proud of our progress, we should not be 
satisfied. We have not proven ourselves committed to 
racial equality and progress without incentive, which 
were the catalysts behind President Lyndon Johnson's 
Executive Order No. 10925 encouraging contempo-
rary affirmative-action policies. 

Now that affirmative-action policies are under at-
tack, we must examine their history before we can 
rightly discredit their value. The inheritance of power, 
privilege and position have been historically determined 
by the color of skin - namely white skin. Promoting 

and preferring whites over blacks for 
employment and education is our heri-
tage. It is only now that affirmative ac-
tion attempts to include underrepre-
sented persons that an uprising to abol-
ish its existence has arisen. 

A fire rages in the heart of every 
black child born in this land of back-
ward and savage social progression. 
America's darker child is less likely 
to survive the paradoxical progress of 
contemporary society than he or she 
was to endure slavery; that is, if one 
can successfully argue that slavery has 
ceased. nie line between shanties and 
ghettos, shackles and minimum wage, 
Mississippi and Simi Valley is thin. 
Advancement is synonymous with 
mutation in American society. The 
roots of racism have remained undis-
turbed; it is only the way racism is ex-
pressed which has changed. 

At the close of the Civil War, we 
passed the 14th ~nd 15th Amendments 
to protect the baSIC rights of black citi-
zens. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were 
necessary because the American people 
effectively dismantled the significance 
of the 14th and 151h Amendments 
through the sanctioned lerror of lynch 
mobs and criminal acts cointd as Jim 

Opponents of modem affirmative-ac-
tion policies claim that it encourages re-
verse discrimination. Modem affirma-
tive-action policies do not discriminate 
against white males, but rather, remind 
publicly funded institutions that our his-
tory of pel'llistently and illegally bestow-
ing preference upon white men will no 
longer be sanctioned. Under affirmative 
action, we must obey the law by accept-
ingand promoting blacJcs into their right-
ful and carned positions of power. Be-
cause affirmative action only serves to 
challenge our racist tendencies, claims of 
reverse discrimination are faulted. Al-
though white men may accurately feel a 
sense of loss because their monopoly on 
power is crumbling, the decay ofourrac-
ist traditions is fair and necessary. 

TIle Inheritance 
of power, 
privilege and 
position have 
been 
historically 
determined by 
the color of 
skin - namely 
white skin. We must be honest with ourselves 

before we can progress to a meritocracy-based socicty 
which is devoid of racial considerations. We arc a rac-
ist nation and have been si nce our inception. We must 
now decide whether we will part with our past or re-
peat it once again. Clearly, affirmative action is not 
the key to equality, but it kecps our viccs in check. To 
effectively reconstruct our society, we will need to 
complement affirmative-action policies with aggres-
sive education programs which honestly examine 
American history. Of course, white men are presently 
on the defensive. We have allowed them to believe that 
this count.ry belongs to them by manifest destiny. 

Crow laws. The American people were unwilling to 
abide the law and the American government failed to 
protect its citizens. For 100 years, public enemy No.1 
has been ourselves. The 14th and 15th Amendments 
have only been actively enforced since the passage of 
the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. Thus the 
legal sanction of the conditions of slavery dominated 
race relations in America until 1965. Without equal pro-
tection under the law, slavery ended only 30 yeai'll ago. 
We have just reached the time of reconstruction. 

We have only begun to confront our demons and 
we have come a long way in the last 30 years. Though

COMMENTARY: Forget the owners; the real culprits in the 'Great Strike of '94' are the greedy, 
insolent, arrogant, short-sighted Major League baseball players 

By Tetld Ledd 
Senior Staff Writer 

"BiII~ ~b, retired plumber and 
one-time Blue Star Ointment sales-
man, throws to the first baseman, 
George Blip, a free-lance construc-
tion worker ... and that'll be the fi-
nal out of the inning .... " 

Critics of Major League baseball 
owners' decision to field replace-
ment players fear that the above 
play-by-play could become a real-
ity by opening day, April 2. It would 
be the first season in over 70 years 
that America's pastime would be 
handed over to steel workers and 
45-year-old journeymen. 

While the politics swirling 
around the "Great Strike of '94" 
continue - while Bud Selig calls 
for "revenue sharing" or Donald 
Fehr complains about "free agency" 
or President Clinton threatens not to 
throw out the first pitch - the apa-
thetic every-fan denounces the info 
being fed to him by the press. 

But not I. 
I say, "Screw the players!" Ig-

nore the sports writers who poke fun 
at the poor scabs. Baseball is still a 
great game. The players are simply 
greedy, money-grubbing, idiotic 
ruffians who don ' t deserve to wear 
Ihe moniker of "Major League 
Baseball" on their sleeves. The play-
ers arc wrong - the scabs are right 
- and I'll tell you why.

agency - the crux of the players'

argument - would mangle the in-
tegrity of baseball beyond recogni-
tion. It's already bad enough as it 
is. Does anyone remember the Blue 
Jays ofa yearago? Toronto's lineup 
card read like an All-Star ballot. 
That's because the Blue Jays hap-
pen to have a shiny, new 90,000-
capacity stadium - and along with 
it, tons of alluring cash. 

With unadulterated free agency, 
players would flock to the "team of 
the moment" like flies to a rotten 
banana-and-birbecue-sauce sand-
wich. In most cases, this would be 
the team with the most money to 
throw around. This has already hap-
pened on a smaller scale. For ex-
ample, watching the Boston Red 
Sox used to mean watching Wade 
Boggs at third base. But now, Boggs 
is a Yankee. It's outrageous! The 
Red Sox couldn't afford to pay him 
a million more, so he jogged over 
to New York - Boston's biggest 
rival for over 60 years -to collect 
some extra dough. Loyalty is lost 
to the almighty dollar. 

But seeing teams fractured apart 
as players hop on the "Who's going 
to pay me the most?" carousel isn't 
the only reason I support the own-
ers in the strike of '94. I also be-
lieve that the players have lost sight 
of what baseball is really about. 

Baseball isn't about wearing gold 
jewelry and speeding in a mill ion-
dollar Mercedes. Baseball was ap-
pealing to America because one

could buy a cheap ticket and watch 
DiMaggio, bone spur and all, try to 
continue a hilling streak. It wasn't a 
hitting streak based on signing a big-
ger contract next year. No, it was a 
record in the books, plain and simple. 
Baseball was about blue-collar folks 
watching blue-collar athletes. Occa-
sionally, something great would hap-
pen out at Fenway Park, and it didn 't 
involve a retractable roof. 

Today's Major League baseball 
players ignore this tradition. Ask

Williams was and the likely answer 
will be, "I dunno. One of my law-
yers?" Players are ignorant of the 
storied past that put them in their 
glorified position. Most players are 
Division I athletes with bogus de-
grees who need their agents to tell 
them the difference between their 
asses and holes in the ground. 

Need another reason to side with 
the owners? Here's one: The play-
ers are · not entertainers, no matter 
what Donald Fehr would have us 
believe. They don't sing the Na-
tional Anthem and they don't do a 
little jig during the seventh-inning 
stretch. Baseball players play base-
ball. That 's it. And lately, they 're not 
even doing that very well. 

In 1993, a record number of er-
rors were committed in baseball. 
The union blamed it 'on the unfamil-
iarity of new players with new 
teams. While that's true, the reason 
why errors are up in Major League 
baseball is because the players have 
forgotten how to play. How many 
muffed pop flies do I have to wit-
ness before strong fundamentals are 
finally reinstated back into the 
game? Players complain about the 
"bright lights" obscuring their vi-
sion in the outfield, when what they 
really mean is that they have stars 
- and dollar signs - in their eyes. 

Perhaps the biggest reason I sup-
port the owners in the strike is that 
players' attitudes need 'a total over-
haul. In their place, conscientious 

athletes should play. Major leagu-
ers were never great role models -
Babe Ruth loved the bottle and Ty 
Cobb killed a man - but, in the 
modern era, athletes of the diamond 
have turned this arrogant behavior 
into an art form. 

Where do I begin? How about 
two San Diego Padres eliciting the 
services of a prostitute last year? Or 
Vince Coleman throwing a fire-
cracker into a crowd of people? Or 
Steve Howe and his multiple drug 
comebacks? Or Darryl Strawberry? 

Even players whom I used to re-
spect, like the Orioles' Cal Ripken, 
keep letting me down. Ripken, who 
is near the record for consecutive 
games played, said on the news that 
he wouldn't even consider breaking 
the lines 10 play. In a related story, 
Kenny Rogers, the first lefty to pitch 
a perfect game in the American 
League, refused to discuss the strike 
because he was "busy playing golf." 

So when you sit back on your 
Barco-Iounger and listen to the "re-
tired shoe salesman" grab a liner 
over short, remember the insolence 
of the striking players. Don't fault 
the scabs for playing. At least 
they're trying their hardest out there. 

Maybe in a few years, the league 
will be back up to par. In the mean-
time, root for the scabs, and root for 
the game itself. Oh, and be nice to 
that pizza-delivery man. He just 
might end up being your "hero" 
Cecil Fielder or Don Mattingly.

GUARDIAN NEWS ARTICLE 'COOKED UP' 
SALINAS All lEGATIONS 

Editor: 
This letter concerns an article 

which was recently published in 
the Guardian ("UCSD Scholar 
Suspect in Assassination," March 
2.1995). Raul Salinas de Gortari's 
affiliation with the Center for U.S.-
Mexican Studies was as a 
nonstipend guest scholar between 
approximately Oct. 1992 and Sept. 
1993. 

In its apparent desire to capital-
ize on the sensationalism of Sali-
nas' past research affiliation with 
the Center. the Guardian has done 
a distinct disservice both to the 
Center and to the university com-
munity. When one responds to que-
ries by a Guardian reporter, one 
does so in the expectation the re-
porter and the editorial staff of the 
Guardian will demonstrate high 
professional responsibility in their 
conduct as journalists. That expec-
tation was sorely disappointed in 
this instance. 

The most egregious mistake in 
this article is its wholly unsubstan-
tiated editorial conclusion that the 
assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu was plotted at UCSD 
("Plans for crime made at UCSD," 
page 3). In all the voluminous cov-
erage in the U.S. and international 
press of Salinas' arrest for his al-
leged participation in this crime, no 
other newspaper has made such a 
statement for the simple reason that 
no one has discovered any evidence 
to support it. 

The character of the Guardian's 
coverage of this story would have

claim that Salinas made the alleged

("Plans for crime made at UCSD ") 
appeared in a subheadline and was 
the result of an editing mistake. The

The recent editorial in the Guard-
ian ("The U.S. Embargo Against 
Cuba Is a Futile Obsession:: March 
2, 1995) made me vividly recall my 
junior semester at the University of 
Miami, during the Cuban Missile 
Crisis. I did not see much of my 
roommate, an officer in the U.S. 
Strategic Air Command, because he 
spent this time sleeping in his 8-52, 
with the engines running. So immi-
nent was the possibility of war. 

Fidel Castro had invited the 
USSR to place nuclear missiles on 
Cuban soil and this issue brought us 
to the brink of nuclear war. We know 
now that Castro did everything in his 
power to obtain tactical nuclear 
weapons and that he urged his So-
viet comrades to use them on us. 

We also know Castro has done 
everything in his power to damage 
the United States and foment com-
munist revol ution elsewhere. You 
may recall that his brother died try-
ing to start a revolution in Bolivia. 
Castro is a relentless enemy. It is only 
because his Soviet handlers failed 
that Castro is less of a threat today. 

Castro is a dictator who has im-
prisoned people for decades because 
of their religious and political beliefs. 
The embargo has not toppled Castro, 
but it has drained his energy and kept 
him from causing us further mischief. 
If tightening the embargo furthers 
that end, then I favor it.

Fraternity 'Slave Auction' Draws Controversy 
RESOLUTION: A.S. 
condemns the concept 
of 'auctioning ' people 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

Respo.ndjng to a Lamda Phi Ep-
silon fraternity flyer advertising a 
funding- rai sing "slave auctio n," 
A.S. Council passed a resolution 
last night condemning "slavery ... 
[and] the auctioning of persons in a 
'slave auction ' in any form." 

The fraternity 'S controversial 
event, which took place last night, 
raised money by auctioning off its 

members' services. 
African-American Student 

Union members Sharon Apple and 
Jill Logan brought the "slave auc-
tion" flyer to the attention of the 
A.S. and urged the council to take 
action, citing the flyer and the event 
as offensive. 

"The concept ofa 'slave auction ' 
exploits and takes advantage of 
people," said Apple. 

Lamda Phi Epsilon Historian Ray 
Chu apologized to the A.S. on be-
half of the fraternity. Lamda Phi 
Epsilon founding member David 
Lee said the event was service-ori-
ented and did not resemble a slave 

auction in any way . . 
"The nature of the event is not 

slavery". [and] is not racist . It's a 
service auction. We're selli ng ser-
vices," said Lee. 

Lee also said his fraternity is 
committed to furthering the rights 
of minorities and did not intend to 
offend anyone. 

Student Organizations and Lead-
ershipOpportunities(SOLO) Lead-
ership Coordinator Paul De Wine 
said he would meet with the 
fraternity's leadership this week to 
discuss why the use of the term 
"slave auction" was inappropriate 
and offensive.

THE [VnI[ 
SEANRAHIMI 

Ultimate 
What? 

I may be a simpleton, but I 
am a firm believer in a very 
fundamental theory that goes 
to the root of the definition of 
"sport." You wanna know what 
it is? Well. he{e goes: There is 
a distinct difference between a 
"sport" and a "recreation." Let 
me explain. 

Tritons Pluck Eagles,· 8·1 
CRUISING: The road to the championship seems 
clearer, as the Tritons pummel Emory College 

A "sport" is a contest of 
guts, heart and strength. It can 
also be a game of strategy, 
cunning and finesse. Soccer, 
football, hockey, tennis and 
basketball are true sports. 

I don't classify badminton, 
bowling, fishing, ping-pong, 
curling, croquet or billiards as 
"sports." These activities go 
l!nder the category of "recre-
ation." In other words, they are 
activities that the average Joe 
can do fairly well. 

For example, the other day 
I was passing by a game of 
ultimate disc. I saw two teams 
in pastel uniforms, spectators 
in lawn chairs and that 
wonderful wrist·action that 
moves the speeding plastic. 

Chuck Niuyen/ GuBtdian 

MIchele Melephensakul beat Emory In both doubles and .In"es. 

By lien Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

As the UCSD women's tennis 
team continues to add impressive 
victories to its undefeated record, 

Somers said. 

the inevitable 
question arises: 

Is this year's 
squad as strong as 
the 1994 team 
that won the na-
tional champion-
ship? 

"1 think we ' re 
better than last 
year," Triton stal-
wart Hilary 

It is still a I iule early to judge, 
but if Monday's 8-1 shellacking of 
visiting Emory College of Georgia 
is any indication, one could argue 
that Head Coach Liz LaPlante's 
1995 version is just as strong. if not 
stronger. 

"It was a great win," LaPlante 

said. 
Indeed. the match was a crucial 

guage for the team. Emory was 
ranked fifth in the nation and is a 
definite championship contender. 

As usual, the Tritons wasted no 
time in establishing their superior-
ity. The team came up big in their 
doubles matches, sweeping all 
three. The top-seeded twosome of 
Miki Kurokawa and Suzi Drage 
attoned for a tough loss at Pomona 
on Saturday, with a hard-fought 9-
7 victory over Amy Smith and 
Megan Bein. 

In a less competetive contest at 
the number-two spot, Michelle 
Malephansakul and Yumi Takemoto 
continued their torrid play, cutting 
Jessica Levy and and Dana Cohen 
down to size, 8-3. 

To anchor UCSD 's doubles ef-
fort, Somers and Morgan Gessford 
outlasted their adversaries by an 8-
6 tally. 

See W. TENNIS, Page 13 Being the cynic that I am, I 
breathed a smart remark about 
the game. Someone immedi-
ately responded, "Hey, frisbee 
is a sport just like football or 
hockey." Whoa, fella! 

UCSD Can't 
Collar 'Dogs 

Lewis Steals Triton Chance 
I will admit, some things do 

impress me about ultimate 
disc. Like the player who 
throws his body to the turf in 
order to catch the speeding, 
neon orb, and those checkered 
bandannas - a IA Andre 
Agassi - are really cool. 

BLOWN: UCSD lost a four-setter in a rare shot at a non-Diy. I foe 

Seriously though, frisbee 
looks like a bad idea brought 
back from the 70's. I could see 
the Brady Bunch family 
throwing the disc around. And 
Greg would be the star. 

But alas, I am digressing 
from my original point. 
Ultimate disc or frisbee or 
whatever you want to call it is 
not a "sport." \I works fine as a 
"recreation." But a "sport" 
needs rcquirements, which 
seemed to be lacking from the 

• game on Sunday at Muir Field. 
In hockey, the players must 

be able to skate and shoot a 
moving puck at the same time. 
In football, they must throw 
the ball in a tight spiral for 50 
yards. Maybe Miller Lite's . 
"Full Contact Frisbee" is an 
idea I could embrace. 

I'll accept ultimate disc as a 
"recreation" and group it along 
with bowling or golf, but don't 
tell me it's the same as hockey 
or basketball. Those are real 
sports. 

BlnEN: UCSD falls, 4-3, 
on late homer at Redlands 
By Seen Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

Sometimes in sports, things don't go 
your way. You seem to be the better team. 
you outpitch them, you even outhit them, 

but you still come out on 
the losing side. 

The UCSD baseball 
team felt this way last 
Tuesday, when it went to 
University of Redlands 
in search of a much· 
needed road victory 
against a rival Div. III 
opponent. The offense 
could only muster three 

runs in the one-run loss, 4-3. 
The Bulldogs' Dusty Brinley hit a 

pinch·hit solo homerun in the bottom of 
the seventh inning to break a 3-3 tie. It 
lifted the Redlands (8-5) to a win over the 
tumbling Tritons (7-5). Nathan Celusta 
took the loss in relief (0-1) for UCSD, and 
the Bulldogs' Scoll Sasser evened his 
record (3-3) with a complete game. 

"We are at a point in the season, whcre 
we know we need to play hard to win 
games," Chris Miyake said . "Without 
mental errors, we win against La Verne and 
Redlands. We' re just not gelling the key 

See BASEBAU, Page 13 

By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

For the UCSD men's vol-
leyball team - a team with 
young players not accustomed 

to losing, the 
1995 season 
has been a bad 
dream. 

"We have a 
lot of younger 
players who 
are not used to 
losing like 
this. Most of 
the playcrs on 

the team come from strong 
high school programs that 
never went through tough 
times. Thc vetcrans on the 
leam.like myself, need to step 
up and take charge," said se-
nior captain Tyson Kerr. 

Tuesday night, the dream 
was still a nightmare. UCSD 
(1-13) faced the Division \I 
Lewis University Flyers (10-7) 
in a non-league showdown at 
RIMAC. The Tritons knew 
they were in for a fight from 
the start, since the Flyers have 
already posted some impres-
sive victories against Division 
I opponents this season. 

Lewis came out and proved 
it, leaving town with a hard-
fought four-set victory over 
UCSD,lO-15, 15-7, 15-11, 15-
9. After taking the opening set, 
the Tritons were unable to put 
away the Flyers, who out-
blocked the Tritons in the 
match, 28-8. 

Lewis was led by big man 
Chris Borden, who tallied up an 
impressive .stat sheet for the 
match - 21 kills, 11 digs, and 
seven blocks, all team-highs. 

"Wc played a lot better than 
we have been, but it still was 
not as good as we should be 
playing. Nobody left the gym 
feeling good," said Kerr. 

Kerr led the Tritons' of-
fense, slamming down a game-
high 26 kills to go along with 
nine digs and three blocks. Out-
side hitter Ton. Black was solid 
once again, leading the team 
with II digs and throwing 
down 18 kills. Matt Minehan 
had his best match since return-
ing to the team full-time with 
13 kills and seven digs. 

The Tritons head up North 
tonight to the Malibu coast for 
a league showdown with Ihf 
Pepperdine Waves.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Women 's Lacrosse 

If not for a little intervention by 
mother nature, the UCSD women's 
lacrosse squad may well have been 
6-0 at this point in the season. In-
stead, the Tritons will have to settle 
for a stellar 5-0 mark as they stare 
down the barrel of their toughest 
contest of the season: a 
showdown with long-
time rival UC Santa Bar-
bara. 

second stanza. 
However, the Tritons took over 

in the clutch, doubling the Athena's 
offensive output in the second half 
en route to the victory. 

"We were better conditioned and 
we moved the ball better," Baker 

Mark Patters.;)nl Guard;an 
The Triton cyclists continued their winning ways, taking fourth and fifth at Claremont. 

UCSD reached this 
level of perfection with 
a narrow 16-15 triumph 
over the Warriors from 
Westmont College in a 
pouring rain. The Tritons 
played the entire contest 
with just one substitute 
player, but were still 
plenty capable of notch-
ing the victory. I n addi-
tion, four more UCSD 
players wcre in the game 
despite nagging injuries. Cycling 

For the UCSD cycling team, it's 
been a season of consistency -
consistent performances, consis-
tent improvement and, most im-
portantly, consistent winning. 

At the Claremont Team Race 
this weekend, for example, the Tri-
ton cyclists captured fifth place 
overall in Saturday's Hill Climb 
and fourth place overall in 
Sunday's Criterium. 

The 8.5-mile Hill Climb time-

Men's Lacrosse 

trial up Glendora mountain wasan 
arduous task, with a 2,OOO-foot el-
evation gain over the course of the 
event. UCSD's highlights included 
Erik Stauber (third in Men's' A'), 
Jeff Hernandez (first in Men's 
'D'), Eric Werner (fifth in Men's 
'C'), Kate'Esley (10th in Women's 
'A') and Bettina Wood (seventh in 
Women's 'B'). 

The Criterium was also a diffi-
cult test for the Tritons, since heavy 

8 triumph. 
"It 's a friendly ri-

valry," Coach Matt 
Holman said. "We 
know each other well." 

UCSD followed up 
that success with a 16-
2 throttling of Sonoma 
State which traveled 
from northern Califor-
nia only Jo be rudely 
greeted by the Tritons. 

San Diego's only 
defeat in conference 
came against Whittier 
on Feb. 25. The Poets 
eeked out an 8-7 win 

The Tritons have charled to a 4-1 mark. over the Tritons. 
UCSD has stormed out of the 

gates this year, systematically dis-
mantling its opponents to the tunre 
of a 4-1 record thus far in the con-
ference season. 

The Tritons raised their mark to 
2-0 when they clobbered cross-
town rival San Diego State back 
on Feb. 15. The Aztecs were no 
match for UCSD's offensive on-
slaught as the it spri nted to an 18-

Skiing 
Just how do you beat the UCSD 

alpine ski team? Not easily. 
I n fact, no one could do it at last 

weekend's Regional Champion-
ships in Incline, Nevada. Held on 
Diamond Peak, the highly com-
petitive meet featured teams from 
UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Stanford, 
USC and UCLA. 

The Triton skiiers proved their 
worth, rolling over the Division I 
stalwarts and grabbing first place 
overall. They also earned the cov-
eted "Best Team in California" tr0-
phy and an entry into the NCSA 
National Championships on March 
S-l1 in McCall, Idaho. 

Only two teams from Califor-
nia are given entry to Nationals. 

"It was really a good game," 
Holman said. "Whoever had the 
balliasl was going to win it." 

UCSD's most recent outing was 
in a trip to Arizona. The Wildcats 
from U of A went down under the 
Triton attack by a 15-11 tally. That 
victory secured for UCSD the 
number-two ranking in the West-
ern Collegiate Lacrosse League. 

- By Dan Kraft 

Aside from UCSD, the other team 
making the trip is Sierra Nevada 
College - a school that special-
izes in recruiting ex-World Cup ski 
racers from Europe. 

While Sierra Nevada can boast 
of high caliber talent from Norway, 
Sweden and Spain, UCSD can 
boast of an impressive men's squad 
that pummelled an incredibly 
tough racing field during the Re-
gional festivities. 

Tritons Jed Reitman, Ian Gini 
and Stephen Mueller dashed into 
several top scoring slots, while 
George Faas and Jon Forrester also 
added to the overall UCSD down-
hill attack. 

- By Tedd Ladd 

rain earlier in the day made for a 
slippery course. 

Nonetheless, Esley (fifth in 
Women 's 'A'), Esther Davis (sixth 
in Women's 'N), Wood (first in 
Women's 'B'), Brittany Gassert 
(second in Women's 'B'), Dan 
Sawada (third in Men's 'B'), John 
Groeling (fourth in Men's 'C') and 
Vic Weinstein (fourth in Men's 
'D'), performed well for UCSD.

Rugby 

Anytime UCSD and Loyola 
Marymount hook up in a rugby . 
match, the intensity is high. And the 
action was fast and furious when the 
two teams battled it out at Warren 
West Field last week. 

Needing a win to stay in a first-
place tie with UC Irvine, the Tri-
tons turned in a physical effort, tak-
ing a last-second 23-17 victory and 
running their league streak up to 
three straight victories. 

"This was a real emotional win 
for us. We played tough from the 
start, and were able to hang with 
them," said Coach Eric Takeuchi. 

With emotions running high at 
the beginning of the game, the hit-
ting was intense. The two teams 
banged away at one another end-
lessly, resuhing in a scuffle between 
the two sides - and ending with 

Ice Hockey 

Taking a trip over Spring 
Break is one thing, but a four-
game road swing through Cali-
fornia, facing hockey teams that 
want to smash your head in -
well, that's a cOmpletely differ-
ent story. 

After beating Long Beach 
State on Feb. 25 by a score of 8-
4, the Tritons traveled north for 
their toughest trip of'the year. 

The team went to Stockton on 
March 3 and came up short in the 
opener against Nevada, 4-2, but 
rebounded to defeat UC Davis, 
7-2, in the nightcap. 

"They are tough 
girls," UCSD Coach UCSD has earned a 5-0 record this year. 
Connie Baker said. "They just said. "We just outplayed them. We 
aren't letting [the injuries] stop work great together as a team."

player from Loyola being ejected. 

Between all the hitting, the Tri-
tons did find time for scoring. Team 
captain Devon Shea sparked the 
squad with a game-high 18 points. 
But even with Shea's heroics, the 

victory over their arch-rivals, 23-17. 
In their next match, however, the 

strains of a tough two weeks caught 
up to UCSD, as they tallied a 43-8 
loss to USC. The loss was the Tri-
tons ' first of the season.

The UCSD Equestrian team was 
looking for some respect last week-
end, and they gained it, finishing 
second overall in the Intercollegiate 
Horse Show at Albany, Oregon. 

Though Stanford, Oregon and 
USC came into the show with 17 
riders, they were still no match for 
the gritty five-member Triton squad. 

The individual stars for UCSD 
included Amanda Perry, who placed 
first in the Intermediate Equitation 
Over Fences and fourth place in 
Open Flat. Other contributors in-
cluded Adrienne Laksfoss (first in 
Intermediate Flat and sixth in Open 
Flat), Patrick Rost (third in Walk 
Trot) and Michele Avila (third in 
Novice Fences and Novice Flat). 

The star of the Davis game 
was K.C. Joy, who racked up a 
hat trick. Shawn McCoy (two 
goals, two assists) and Chris 
Donelly (one goal, two assists) 
also did well. 

The next team for UCSD was 
Pacific, and the Tritons went 
down in defeat 11-0. The gruel-

UCSD strualed to reach 5-11. 
ing trip finally came to a close, as 
UCSD lost to UCLA, 6-0. 

"Perry just joined us this quar-
ter," Avila said. "She has a lot of 
experience and team spirit. The 
whole year we've had good spirit, 
and we help each other out."

Tritons Rip By Washington U., 6-1 
By Hilary Somers 
Slaff Writer 

After being rained out on Sun-
day, the men's tennis team came out 
ready to play on Tuesday against 

Washington Uni-
versity. 

Head Coach 
Brian Turner 
wasn ' t disap-
pointed with the 
outcome - the 
Tritons were on 
the plus side of a 
6-1 pounding. 

The number-
one duo of Robert 

Ho and Dan Brounstein disposed of 
their opponents 8-4, after being 
down 4-1 in the pro-set. The num-

Upended Emory 
Continued from pale 9 

As the Tritons entered singles 
action, the team already had three 
wins under its belt, meaning they 
had to win only two of the remain-
ing six matches to clinch the over-
all victory. Not that winning singles 
matches is an Achilles ' heel for the 
team - UCSD came out on top in 
five of them. 

Malephansakul endured a tough 
challenge from Emory's number-
one player, Levy. After losing the 
first set, 6-4, she worked hard to 

~e the second 6-4. Then, she got a 

ber-two doubles combo of Frank 
Heeb and Mike Wilson had it even 
easier, tallying a 8-3 win. 

The Tritons' only doubles loss 
came at the number-three spot, 
where Ari Marken and Emil Mihet 
fell, 8-4. It liad no damaging effects 
on their team, as UCSD clinched by 
winning two of the three matches. 

Number-one singles player Ho 
led the singles assault with a me-
thodical, 6-4, 6-2 victory. 
Brounstein did his part at number-
two, notching a 6-1 , 7-5 triumph. 
Heeb had it even easier, acing the 
number three slot, 6-2, 6-2. 

The greatest singles match of the 
day came from Wilson. The match 
was a test of mental toughness, as 
he got off to a slow start in the first 

second wind and blew away 
Levy in the third, 6-1. 

Number-two Somers suffered 
a rare loss to Smith, falling 6-2, 
6-1. Third-seeded Drage also 
weathered a tenacious effort from 
her counterpart. Bein, but pulled 
out an eventual 6-4, 7-5 triumph. 

Number-four Kurokawa, even 
with a Ict-down in the second set, 
crushed Cohen, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. The 
fifth spot, meanwhile, belonged 
to Gessford, who pulled the car-
pet out from under Kristen 
Wesoloski, 7-5, 6-1. 

Yumi Takemoto closed out the 
Triton conquest with a convinc-
ing beating of Nadine Haseruch, 
6-1,6-2. 

set, down 3-1. He then started to get 
back into the flow, not allowing his 
opponent to get another game. Wil-
son went on to win the set, 6-3. 

Finding himself severely down 
in the second set, 5-1, Wilson turned 
it on, embarrassing his opponent in 
the second set, 7-6. Meanwhile, the 
sixth seed, Ping Yeh, mopped up his 
opponent, 6-2, 6-2. 

The only match that went 
Washington 's way was at the num-
ber five spot, where Mihet let his 
opponent back in the match after 
winning the first set. He eventually 
fell in the next two sets, 6-0, 6-2. 

"This match made us realize 
what we need to work on to get 
ready for our next matches," 
Brounstein said.

hits we need." 

The story of the game was the 
Tritons' inability to score with run-
ners on base. UCSD had 11 hits and 
left eight men on base. The lone 
bright star was third baseman David 
Yerman's three-run blast. Yerman's 
(2-4, 3 RBI, run scored) hitt.ing he-
roics were accompanied by Jason 
Aguilar (2-4) and Miyake (2-4). 

"The opposing teams are execut-
ing lh~ simple plays and we're not," 
Miyake said. "We can't waste the 
opportunities we have."

, BIAIIIrc:upI (3-0) 64 teamsl Three Mekends of play. What of tournament is the NCAA ofIering? Try over 100 teams playing every 

night !Of one week. This is a serious 
tournament. Hoop-a·hoIies w~1 get their fill 01 action 
as the 1M Basketbal Playoffs wiI consume RIMAC 
over the next 10 days and ~ all gets ooder way 
tonightl Men 's A, M , AM & 5"0' all begin tonight 
with every division in action on Sunday. 

The 1M Front Desk on ,he 4th Floor 01 RIMAC 
has all the info so come by or call 534-37'6 to find 
out when and where you play. Here Is a quick look 
at each division: 

MEN'SAMA 
This is the prime·time. The biggest and the 

best. It should be a great final 
featuring two 01 the best 
squads assembled in qUM 
some time. MEAN MACHINE 
is on a mission. They 
dispatched with league 
opponents and only broke a 
sweat on a ooupIe 0/ 
occasions. They like to use 
Ihelr speed to run and shoot 
M up. But when they bring it 
into the paint GOGGLES 
PAiZANO won't hesitate to 
lean on 'em and establish 
their~. This should 
be a great final wiIIlliUIe 
chance 0/ upsets along the 
way. 

MEN'S AM 
Courtside observers have all but handed the 

title to BOOT KNOCKERS. They are impressive, 
but have found playolliffe a lillie rough as fevorites 
the past couple 0/ campeigns. f.qe and nagging 
injuries could slow GRUMPY OLD MEN in a single 
etimination tournament like this, but some ice, a 

, little tape, bubble gum and a couple quarts 01 oil 
should get this squad to the final four. TH E 
SWOLLEN ASS didn' have much trouble in league 
and should be ready to expiode into title 
contention. CHEESE rolled through an easy league 
piling up big offensive numbers. The eXIra length 0/ 
the Arena courts could cause trouble though as 
conditioning is suspect. 

MEN'SAA 
This is a new division which is filled wiIIlthe 

best teams from the 'A'division. 22 teams will be 
working hard k) capture this title. The top seeds like 
BELOW THE RIM, THE BOMB IV, THE TALL AND 
SHORT and FL YIN' ELVIS' have had their way with 
easy league opponents up 'til now. With a level 
playing field look lor upsets all over the place. This 
one promises 10 be wide open with finalists coming 
from anywhere. 

MEN'S A 
What a grab bag this thing should bel We've 

finaly got the teams that belong in 'A' playing 
against each oCher. Unfortunately, like the 9th race, 

you never know what you'H get. The SPAM BOYS 
ike their namesake are a hybrid mix 0/ basketball 
players and artificial fillers (~ke sawdust) that could 
cook up a final four appearance. It can1 be their 
'game' that works 10( WE GET CHICKS, but don't 
be surprised ff they take home the blue ribbon. How 
'bout YOUR BUCKET and CHALK IT UP to round 
out the final four. The stretch run wi. be a cavalry 
chargel 

MEN'S "'0' 
The final IolX should be straightforward at this 

level. It will all boil down k) whose 5'8' post player I 
point guard can operate in the paint and h~ free 
throws. No doubt RICE AND BEANS will make an 
appearance. They have all the ingredients rolled up 

into a tight package. 
ELECTRIC YOUTHS have 
plenty 01 juice to give 
anyone a run. POWER 
.RANGERS can do it al 
and conquer any evil, 
right? We'll see. The 
¥eleran squad 01 MILZAC 
& CHILZEE knows how to 
get to the wire and should 
roIMld W this Ioresome. 

WOllEN'S 
This wiI be the best 

action 01 the week. Great 
teams that play haId will 
be lighting up RIMAC right 

up until Thursday's final. On top all year, LUCKY'S 
NIGHTMARE, gets top consideration in a crowded 
field. SHORT: BUT SWEET has played a stingy 
brand of defense that should keep them in any 
game. Looking to a return to the finals, AI·YAlI is not 
far behind. The fourth semi-finalis1 wiN ~kely be 
ASH OUT OF WATER who put together a solid 
statistical effort in league. 

COEDAA 
The mte hopes 0/ the defending champs, YEU 

CANT PlAY, rest squarely on the shooting arm 01 
Unco/n Combs. He is firing at a 68% ctip from 3-
point land lately and only Unco1n can slow that 
down. If he's off look lor CHRIS'S CREW or TRiPlE 
THREAT to pick up the slack. If LEFT VEGAS AT 
NOON could pulthe guys on the shelilld lei the 
gals run the show they would be much ~, 
but look lor an early exij lor this squad. 

COED A 
Aip a coin lor this one. BOY SHE'S GLADIA· 

TOR has to get the nod on name alone. They have 
championship tradition, but THROW IT UP has 
struggled wiIIllnjuries and inconsistent shooting. 
The WARRIORS finished strong and have 
momentum heading into the 1DImament. But, walch 
out !Of SEE US, HEYI who has been holding

Historical events and fantasies 
oollide in a fanciful journey laken by 
the monk responsible for bringing 
Buddhism from India to his native 
China in "Monkey King: TheJourney 
Begins."Theplay, which runs through 
March 17 at the Lyceum Theatre, is , 
the first of a trio of plays that The 
Asian Story Theater is presenting 
based upon Wu Cheng En's 17th-
century Chinese fantasy novel Jour-
ney to the West. 

"The Journey Begins" is the first 
part of the story of the faithful monk. 
Traveling between the two countries, 
he is aided by Friar Sand, Pig-Man 
and the mischievous and trouble-mak-
ing Monkey King. These three char-
acters, who all possess incredible 
martial arts skills, are charged with 
the duties of keeping the monk safe. 
Together, the Monkey 
King, the monk, Pig-Man 
and Friar Sand face 99 tri-
als and challenges. 

Since its inception in 
1990, the Asian Story The-

. ater has produced plays 
adapted from well-known 
Chinese stories such as Ihe 
"White Snake," "Monkey 
King and the Mountains of 
Fire!" and "The Candlewick Fairy."

"This goal of produc-

ingtheaterspecifically for 
children or for families, 
bringing them into this 
magical world, and not 
only that, but producing 
multi-cultural works with 
mulli-ethnic casts ... it's a 
mission that deserves to 
be served upon itself," 

said Gingerlily Lowe,theeducational 
director of the Asian Story Theater. 

"I learned a lot about Asian litera-
ture from listening to stories from my 
grandparents and my uncles and 
aunts," she added.

HIATUS 4 The UCSD Guardian Thursday, March 9, 1995 

Erotiqne 
Film intelligently combines political 
issues with explicit sexual material 

By Jeff NleHl 
Hiatus Editor 

Movies that bill themselves as erotic often 
tend to be letdowns. They either have reaction-
ary agendas (Disclosure), revolve around inane 
plOts (Color of Night) or center on masculine 
desire (any porn film). Erotique falls into none 
of these categories. The three short films in 
Erolique have their share of hokey sex scenes, 
yet the films ' wit and intelligence is seldom seen 
in most so-called erotic movies. 

Lizzie Borden (Working Girls, Love Crimes) 
directs the first of the short films, Let's Talk 
Aboul Sex. The film follows Rosie (Kamala 
Lopez-Dawson), an aspiring actress who lives 
in Los Angeles and works at a phone-scx busi-
ness while going through auditions. 

Customers generally hang up on 
Rosie because she refuses to pander 
to their tastes and describes herself 
as Latino, African-American or 
Asian instead of blonde and Cauca-
sian. When one caller (Bryan 
Cranston) does take interest in her 
fantasies (men lining up to perform 
cunnilingus to her), she becomes 
suspicious of his intentions. 

Mter some investigation Rosie discovers he 
is an author who writes about femalesexuality, 
andshefindsaway to get back at him. Although 
the dialogue in LeI's Talk is often stilted, the film 
succeeds because it accurately portrays not only 
the power dynamics of sexual relationships but 
also life in a lower-class LA. neighborhood. 

Claire (priscilla Barnes) and Julia (Camilla 
Soeberg) are lovers in the second short film, 

Monika Treut's Taboo Parlor, set in Hamburg, 
Germany. When the two wake up in each other's 
arms, they decide they will take a man home for 
the evening. They go to an S&M bar and pick up 
Victor (Michael Carr) and begin to seduce him 
on the bus ride to Claire's place. 

Once home, Victor's interest inJulia piques 
and as he begins to have sex with her, Claire 
attaches a strap-on to herself and begins to have 
anal sex with him. He is so upset that he stops 
screwing Julia and leaves. Although the film's 
point is somewhat muddled, the anal sex scene 
is funny and provocative. 

The final short film, Clara Law's Wonton 
Soup, is the best of the three because it presents 
sexual issues alongside cultural ones. After six 

months of separation, Chinese-born, 
Australian-raised Adrian (Tim 
Lounibos) meets his girlfriend Ann 
(Hayley Man) in Hong Kong. After 
several nights of heated sex, Ann 
decides they shou Id break up. 

Adrian thinks Ann wishes to end 
the relationship because he is not 
Chinese enough, and he reads a Chi-
nese book on sexual positions to · 
impress her. After trying all 30 posi-

tions in an amusing sex scene, Adrian collapses 
. as he pulls a muscle. As the two try to understand 

their relationship with each other, they come to 
realize that, because they don't belong to any 
one culture, it's not easy for them to find a 
comfortable place in the world. 

Erotique is playing at the University Town 
Center, Hazard Center, Rancho Bernardo and 
Plaza Bonita Theatres.

CROW: Singer 
plays new songs 
Continued from paaee Hi 
won last week (Best New Artist, 
Record of the Year and Best Pe-
male Pop Vocal Performance), 
Johnston finished his excellent, yet 
almosl unnoticed, set. 

Clad in an incongruous outfit 
of combat boot and red-gingham 
sundress, Crow delighted the 
crowd by simply taking the stage. 

A perfect primer for MTV Un-
plugged, the stage was sel with 
empty gilded frames suspended 
against a red velvet curtain, calico 
lampshades, couches and lava 
lamps, achievinga very trendy cof-
fee-house effect. 

HlAruS 5 

But, not to be confused with female 
singerswhochoosetobeprirnadonnas 
amid harems of male band members, 
Crow shared the stage graciously with 
a female bassistJbackground vocalist. 

After opening with a pumped-up 
rendition of "Leaving Las Vegas," 
she asked the usual c;rowd motivator, 
"How arc you guys doing?" Theil she 
responded, "We'redoinggood,thanks 
for asking ... it's been a good week," 
alluding to her new admission into 
Grammy heaven. 

The epitome of Crow cool washer 
debut of a brief, beatnik version of 
"Alii WannaDo," half-recited,half-
sung against accoustic guitars, a 
guagira and a conga drum, while 
lounging on a comfortably worn-out 
couch. 

Kerry Fox, Ewan McGre,or and Christopher Eccleston try to escape In 5h11Uow Gr.ve. 

Crow is growing 10 be an old 
hand at concert touring. She was 
perceivably calmer and more con-
fident performing onstage than 
when San Diego saw her at Street 
Scene last summer. 

Crow continued to amaze the pleas-
antly sober, yet ecstatic crowd by 
ostensibly showing her adeplness at 
the accordion during "Strong 
Enough," and then the keyboards dur-
ing the unreleased, "Miscreations." 

Shallow Grave Her band was right on the ball, executing flawless riffs and carry-ing the signature twangy melo-
dies. In particular, the drummer 
was thehighlightoftheband, keep-
ing the beat strong. Crow's live 
voice has a brassy rawness which 
is absent in the album. It is also 
higher pitched and more nasalthan 
on her album Tuesday Night Mu-
sic Club. 

The last song of the sct, a straight 
version of "All I Wanna Do," was 
evidently like pulling teeth for Crow. 
She sang, "Al l I wanna do/is have 
some fun," with an annoyed. semi-
stoic countenance and randomly al-
tered the melody to keep herself from 
snoring. 

Search for roommate goes bad in new black comedy 
By Chla-lln Simmons 
Staff Writer 

What would you do if your room-
mate turned up dead (and naked) in 
his room, leaving a huge suitcase of 
money? Would you call the police or 
would you chop up his body, bury him 
in a shallow grave and keep Ihe dough? 
After very little discussion, David 
(Christopher Eccleston), Alex (Ewan 
McGregor) and Juliet (Kerry Fox) 
decide to do the latter. The dismem-
berment takes place in justthe first 15 
minutes of this fast-paced indepen-

dent film from Scotland. 
Dizzying, twisted and very dis-

turbing, Shallow Grave is a great 
movie. The horrific decision to dis-
member the dead roommate is the 
beginning of a dark, scary and yet 
sometimes hilarious, series of events 
that consume the lives of David, Alex 
and Juliet. The tense, slightly nerdy 
accountant, David, is the unlucky one 
who drew the short straw to dismem-
ber the body, and he receives no sym-
pathy from his roommate Alex, an 
abrasive journalist who instigates the 

action. Juliet, a doctor, is also no help 
as she pits the two male roommates 
against one another. 

Although all the actors lurn in 
memorable performances, Eccleston 
is most noteworthy. Eccleston, who 
has had a solid career on stage and 
TV, is electrifying, playing David as 
more than a cookie-cutter accountant 
gone bad. He makes the character a 
strangely neuroticand vulnerable man. 

Shallow Grave is what many hor-
ror and suspense fi Ims prom ise, but 
never deliver. 

Her onstage presence is that of 
a true rocker. She belted out some 
amazing, raspy wails, while strok-
ing Ihe guitar with shameless con-
viction, bringing the crowd to riv-
eting madness. At one point she 
even did Axl Rose-like fancy foot-
work, strutting bac~ards to the 
beat while bending at the waist. 

But the oblivious crowd would 
have almost deemed the night incom-
plete had it not been sung. 

After one encore of two songs, she 
did an irreverently clumsy curtsy with 
the band. He[ appeal to both baby-
boomers and twentysomethings, the 
rcasonforherGrammy-winningpopu-
larily, was evident as UCSD Vice-
Chancellor of Undergraduate Affairs 
Joseph Watson and students alike 
made their way out of the arena, well 
satisfied with the concert.
