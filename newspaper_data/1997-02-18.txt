Students Collaborate to Write Editorial 
Criticizing Connerly for Political Actions 
REQUEST: Student leaders ask 
regent to step down, citing his 
anti-affirmative-action politics 
By Naomi Falk 
Staff Writer 

Fourteen undergraduate and graduate student 
body presidents ':>y temwide co-authored an edi-
torial last week 111 the L.A. Ti/lles and the Sail 
Francisco C/rrollicle. calling for C Regent Ward 
Connerly to voluntarily ~tep down. 

The move follows onnerly ' ~ recent \tatement 
10 the Sail Francisco Chronicle thaI he plans to 
wnduct a national campaign to end all aflirma-
tlve-acllon program~ . 

"[The edi torial I was neces':>ary because Regent 
Connerly ' s political ac ti Vity is a breach of hiS 

respon~lhilit as a regent to the ~tate and the 
unrver\lty ." said oleen ahatini. U 0 A.S. 

President and a co-signer of the edi torial. 
Connerly introduced mea~ures SP-I and SP-2, 

banning the usc of affirmative action in universi ty 
hiring and admissions processes. The measures 
were passed at the July 1995 Board of Regent 
meeting. 

Connerly also took over the leadership of the 
Proposi tion 209 campaign last year. 

The ~tudent hody presidents who signed the 
editorial allege that onnerly hroke hi s trust with 
the universi ty and the public when he used hi s 
position as a regenl to spearhead a campaign 
against affi rmati ve aClion . 

One student leader who did not sign the edito-
rial said that regardles:, of political helicr,. 

onnerly was "accessible" and concerned ahou t

Resolution 
AboutOSD 
MONEY: Students ay 
current allocations are not 
sufficient to meet need 
By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Staff Writer 

A. . passed a resolution last Wednesday 
expressing dissatisfaction with the adminis-
tration for not allol:ating more than mini-
mum funding to the Office for Student with 
Disabilities (OSD). 

Speci fically , the resolution states that 
"necessary services and funding lat CSDI 
have remained stagnant despite the increase 
in students with disabilities three folds in the 
last decade." 

The reso lution wa passed in response to 
recommendations made by tire Office of the 
Student Advocacy after reviewing OSD 
funding. statistics and services. 

The review also took into al:ount compli-
ance with the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA), passed in 1990, which man-
date that "all programs should be made 
acce sible upon request to students with 
di sabilities." 

A.S. Internal Vice President Alex ario 
said U SO is "meeting the minimum re-

quirement~ bu t Ihecausel the number of 
students with di sabi lities Ihasl been In\.:rea~ ­
ing over the years. those services have be-
come increasingly inadequate." 

Moshe Willlum, outreach assistant for 
the OSD. said that not only ha~ the numher 
of students increased, hut the characteri~tics 
of the stuuents' di abilities have changed. 

"We have more expensive disabilities ... 
we have more deaf and hearing impaired 
students ," Witwm said . .. ext year. with 
the start of the master's program. we're 
expecting six to 12 moredeaf~tuuent~ . " 

"This issue is not going to go away he-
cause the students don ' t believe that all of 
the accommodations that the university need~ 
to be giv rng them to ~ucceed acaue mica lly 
are 111 plal:e," he sa id . 

OSD stati stics tate that in 1990-9\. 411

increased to 432 students III 1995-96, and I .

teams arc competing to win , only 
to sec their efrort s diminished hy 
the la7.incss or apathy or the

For some of us, Intramurals 
represent the only chance to vent 
the frustrations and stress that build 
up as a result of UCSD' fast-paced 
academic life. Conscquently, we 
feel cheatcd when the ou lcomcs of

indi rfcrence of an official. Can you 
blame us? 

0, zebras, because you're 
gelling paid for the job - try

15" that 
notorious legacy of which 

we were informed in high schoo l -
is a trademark resu lt of the college 
student '~ ambi va lent rel ationship 
with rood. While the average student 
pantry ranges from bare to 
overstuffed with nutritiously sinful 
food, there is no denying that diet 
and nutrition remain important 
issues ror students well past the 
infamou first year. 

"Nutritional issues are a big 
concern on campus," Lupc 

amaniego-Kraus , the health 
education direc tor at Student Health 
Services, said. 
The Balanced Diet 

According 10 Samaniego-Kraus, 
student diets arc usually unbalanced 
as a result or neglect produced by 
hectic ~chedules. 

"Protein is a another downfall," 
Samaniego-Kraus said . " tudent s 
tend to go for fa t and easy, which IS 

u~ually carbohyd rate~." 
Roosevelt sophomore Elilubeth 

Richardson. who d~sc ribe her own 
dlel a~ "hurried," agreed. 

"It I~ a rant} to have a good meal 

that I ~ ~ca ted at a tahle with no 
hurry," Richardson said 'There is 
always a time constraint. M eat is 
expensive ... I cat lots or hread. Good 
vegetables with nutrients and green 
sa lads are harder to come by." 

Between the rations of bagel s, 
fast rood and so ft drinks that 
con tit ute the collegiate staple diet, 
many students simply are not aware 
of the consequences of consuming 
certain foods. 

") see students at the salad bar 
pUlling together a salad, talking 
abou t how healthy they are by eating 
a salad, pouri ng on croutons, salad 
dressing and bacon bits, until that 
healthy sa lad has more calories than 
a cheeseburger," Madhu Narayan, 
the health education outreach 
coordinator for Student Health 
Ser ices, said. 

In addition to the daily three-to-
four ervings of fruits and 
vegetables. per your mother's

said . " It 's easy to grah a Coke. Water 
i ' so natural, with no calories or 
preservatives. A lot of chemical 
reactions that take place [in our 
bodies] need water. College students 
aren' t gelling enough." 

According to UCSD biOlogy 
professor and author of UCSD 
Nutrition Book Paul Saltman, 
students do not drink enough milk. 
He recommends a minimum of 800 
- preferably 1,000 - mi lIigrams of 
calcium a day. While the concern 
over calcium is especially re levant 
ror women, everyone should be 
aware of herlhis intake. 

"Osteoporosis i a disea e in 
older women, but it is predicated on 
the bones going into menopause," 
Saltman said. "Soda and Bud Light 
don't do it. The only sources of real 
calc ium in our diet are dairy 
products and occasionally, corn 
IOni lla~." 

For the lactose-i ntolerant , 
Saltman also recommends dail y

"College ~tudents really need to 
reduce fasi -rood intake," Narayan 
said. "It is high in calories and high 
in fat - ridi culously SQ." 

In an effon to trim fat from

line Ihe aisle\ or gro 'cry stores. 
Their package~ herald "fat-free" 
and " n n-fat " ~logans. promising

commonly found in icc crea m. 

"They feel smooth, taste

"The first time away 
from home, 
students are 
overwhelmed by all 
of the choices ... 
parents use food to 
soothe or rewar .. 
children. If that Is [a

coping mechanism 
or a predominant 
one, then you run

We could use some 
of his courage today_ 
Dr, Martin Luther King Jr.'s 

personal account: "Almost immedi-
ately after the protest had been 
undertaken, we began to receive 
threatening telephone calls and 
letters in our home , At first I took 
them in stride ... but as the weeks 
passed, I realized that many of the 
threats were in earnest. I felt myself 
faltering and growing In fear. 

"After a particularly strenuous day, 
I settled in bed at a late hour. I was 
about to doze off when the telephone 
rang. An angry voIce said, 'Listen 
nigger, we 've taken all we want from 
you. Before next week you 'll be sorry 
you ever came to Montgomery. ' I 
hung up, but I could not s leep , It 
seemed that all of my fears had 
come down on me at once . I had 
reached the saturation point. 

"I got out of bed and 
began to walk the floor. 
Finally, I went to the 
kitchen and heated a 
pot of coffee. I was 
ready to g ive up. I 
tried to think of a 
way to move out of 
the picture without 
appearing to be a 
coward. In this state 
of exhaustion, when 
my courage had 
almost gone , I 
determined to take 
my proble.m to God. 

"My head In my hands , I bowed 
over the kitchen table and prayed 
aloud. The words I spoke to God that 
midnight are still vivid in my memory. 
'I am here taking a stand for what I 
believe is right. But now I am afraid. 
The people are looking to me for 
leadership, and if I stand before them 
without strength and courage, they 
too Will falter. I am at the end of my 
powers. I have nothing left. I've come 
to the POint where I can 't face It 
alone . 

"At that moment I experienced the 
presence of the Divine as I had never 
before experienced him. It seemed 
as though I could hear the quiet 

assurance of an inner 
voice, saying, 

'Stand up for 
righteous-

ness, 
stand 
up for 

truth . God will be at your side for-
ever. ' Almost at once my fears began 
to pass from me. My uncertainty 
disappeared. I was ready to face 
anything. The outer situation re-
mained the same, but God had given 
me inner calm . 

"Three nights later, our home was 
bombed. Strangely enough, lac· 
cepted the word of the bombing 
calmly. I knew now that God is able to 
give us the interior resources to face 
the storms and problems of life. 
Admitting the weighty problems and 
staggering disappointments, Chris-
tianity affirms that God is able to give 
us the power to meet them." *

How Do You DEAL WITH MIDTERMS? 
Interviews by Grace Jang • Photography by Ethan Schreiber 

I don'\. I put off studying 
until the very, very last 
minute, then I stay up all 
night. Being tired somehow 
helps my grade. The cram-
ming method IS usually 
effective. I say, let 's see -
read a stupid fashion maga-
zine or study? Okay, maga-
zine. Watch t.v. or do your 
work? Okay, t.V. Go to a 
party?, etc. And I eat a lot 
of cereal because I don 't 
want to leave the house 
during midterms, so I study 
and procrastinat at home. 

Rachel Fernandes 
Marshall Freshman 

. J ·top and think that I'm 
not the only person in the 
world with midterms. 
Everyone is going through 
the same thing and I don't 
feel alone. Loneliness is the 
problem that people have 
- that's what stresses them 
out. So if you can abandon 
that feeling of loneliness 
and you could feel that 
everyone is going though 
the same thing , then it's a 
lot easier to cope. it's all 
relative. Group work would 
alleviate that loneliness. 

Kuros Charney 
Muir Senior 

PROGRAM IN 

Just bear down and 
relax . It 's not the ultimate 
thing that's going to hap-
pen in life. Whether I fail 
this midterm or not, I'm 
still a good person. I realize 
that I'm not going to fail -
I got into this university. 
Usually, how you do on 
midterms doesn't signify 
whether you do well in the 
class, so if I study hard for 
a midterm, I learn from that 
studying. And I go homc 
and watch "The Simpsons" 
- that 's always important. 

Darren Xanthos 
Muir Senior 

I study. First, you've got 
to start early. You can't wait 
until the last minute, espe-
cially if it's a hiology class. 
Go over your lecture notes. 
Reading the book isn't 
helpful - it just confuses 
you and makes you think 
about too Illany things. 
Don't get much sleep. I 
drink Coke all night. A full 
bladder keeps me awake. 
Don 't eat as much, because 
you get full and sleepy and 
drowsy. What always helps 
me is praying. 

Steve Kim 
Muir Senior 

• 

There's a 101 of procrasti-
nati ng, stre sing, all-
nighters with coffee and diet 
Coke. Srudying at home is 
bad, because I'll balance my 
checkbook or something. 
Studying at the library i 
okay. but there are so many 
books that sometimes I'd 
rather be reading. So I 
study in a place where I 
could sit down, order coffee 
or tea and not have to talk to 
anyone, but still every now 
and then I can look up and 
watch people walk by.

Water Polo Hosts Nation's Top Teams 
SHOWCASE: Canyonview Pool was the host site for the UCSD Invitational last weekend, officially starting the] 997 season 
By Jonah Nlsenson 
Guardian Reporter 

Take a look at theChieago Bulls or 
the San Francisco 4gers. What has 
made them the championship teams 
that they are? One might answer this 
question with a simple response: raw 
talent. But in addition to raw talent, a 
team needs players who know how to 
win and know what it fee ls like to win. 
In other words. a tcam needs experi-
ence. 

With the loss of five eniors from 
last year's squad, the UCSD women 's 
water polo team i clearly lacking in 
leadership. Add 15 freshman to the 
mi x and you can't expect to see a team 
with the amcconlidence and skillsof 

past women's teams. This team has 
limited experience playing together, 
and there is no substitute for chemis-
try. 

Thursday evening at Canyonview 
pool , the UCSD women's water polo 
team opened the 1997 SC~ on again t 
the Golden Bears of UC Berkeley. 
The match showcased the Bears' ex-
cellent pa sing and unstoppable in-
side game as the Tritons were de-
fcated by a score of 18-3. 

In the first quarter, Cal took con-
trol of the tempo, forcing tumovers 
from a UCSD team that was missing 
senior Shawna Cahaiiero, junior Kelly 
Gilbreth and sophomore Jenny Irwin 
to swimming priorities. Tiffany 

Claire SChne lder/Guardl~n' 

Duncan had two of her fou r goals for 
the Bears in th~ period, helping her 
team to convert many of the UCSD 
turnovers. 

Throughout the game, the Triton 
struggled with their passing. 
They had trouble catching the 
ball cleanly and on too many 
occasions, the perimeter play-
ers tried to force the ball inside 
tofre hmanAnneCannon.who 
was having enough trounle of 
her own with Cal's swarming 
defense. 

"Onearea[wherell wanted 
to see us do well was 111 controlling the 
ball on the perimeter," Triton Hcad 
Coach Denny Harper aid. "Wedidn't 
do that tonlghl." 

While allowing six more goal. in 
the second period. the Triton, man-
aged to score two of their own. Anne 
Cannon scored the first, and fre~hman 
Angie Kondrat notched the second a,

said. "She will improve at a rapid 
rate." 

Following the match-up with Cal, 
the Tritons prepared for the UC San 

Diego Invitational that took 
place Friday through Sunday. 
Among the eight teams who 
competed were San Diego 
State. Stanford. UC Berkeley, 
tiC Davis, USC, UCLA. C 
Santa Barbara and UC D. 

Friday night. with Cabal-
lero back in the lineup, the 
Tritons faced San Diego State. 

CSO showed heller hall movement 
than in the previous game. but the 
multiple shots takcn from the outstde 
were either blocked or flew wide of 
the net. The game ended wtth the 
Aztecs lrouncing the Tritons, 16-4.

Triton~ hreathed a sigh of relicI'. They 
would not be shut out this galne. al-
though a 16-1 loss was not much to 

celebrate. 
Fighting hard defensively in their 

next game, the Tritons lost a 3-0 heart-
breaker to the Aggies of UC Davis. 
Triton goali e Alice Hu zez blocked a 
slough of Aggie hots, but Davis goalie 
Blake Simpson managed to blank the 
Triton in abrilliant effor1. The differ-
ence in the game was UCSD' s inabil-
ity to create good looks at the net. 

In the Tritons' next two games on 
Sunda , they continued to improve, 
yet still fell short of a victory. 

In an overtime loss to UC Santa 
Barbara. the UCSD women looked 
like a rejuvenated bunch. Still strug-
gling with perimeter passing, the Tri-
tons were able to convert on lhe six-

Biola Squeezes Tritons Out 
EXTRA INNINGS: UCSD let a 6- 1 lead slip, dropping the conte t 7-6.

win of the young season. They had 
heen down by four runs in Ihe 
sixth inning oflhal game, hullhey 
PUI togelher a huge rally and reg-
iSlered <In 8-6 viclory. 

After Ihe firsl inning in Biola, il 
was apparent thai Head Coach Rob-
erl Flelcher's squad was slill , shall 
we say, en Il/eRo. The offen e gOI 
starled immediately as it continued 
the assau lt on enemy pitching. Jun-
ior shorlstop Mark Mason's two-

run homer was Ihe cala lyst as Ihe 
Tritons hui It a rour-run lead. 

Leading 4-0 in the top of the 
second, the Trilons conlinued 10 
hammer away at the Eagle starter, 
swring anolher run. However, in 
the hOllom or the inning, the Tri -
IOns showed they weren't perfec t 
and ga ve up a run . 

BUI U SO was sti II up hy four 
and looked confiden t as slarler

20 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Volleyball Continues 
Top 10 Dominance 
AGAIN: Coming off an upset win against No. 10 USC, the Triton contin-
ued their historic run by defeating the No.9 ranked Long Beach State 4ger 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

A message has been sent \0 the 
Division I volleyba ll programs in 
the Mountain Pacific Sport~ Fed-

erati on: UCSD i~ no 
longer a squad to be 
taken lightly or to be 
seen as an automatic 
win on the schedule. 

Following their 
dramatic upset of No. 
lOS last Wednes-
day, Ihe Triton~ rolled 

out the red carpct for thc o. 9 
ranked 4ger~ of Long Beach State 
on Salurday night. After the smoke 
had cleared follOWing two hour 
and five game~ of Intense play, 
UCSD had somethi ng it had never 
had before: a winning streak in con-
ference play. 

The victory over the Trojans had 
beenUC D'sfirsteveragainstatop 
10 squad and the Tritons could Ihink 
of no beller wa" r celebrating the 
win then by repc. b the feat against 
Long Beach State. 

"This is just an unreal feeling," 
junioropposite hiller lon Yarris said. 
"Beating US gave this team the 
confidence that we needed and win-
ning back-to-back was just the next 
step." 

As was the case against the Tro-

jan~, Ihe Tril()n~ faced a 4l)er lineup 
thai lowered over Iheir own, but 
Ihey were able 10 overcome the 
height disadvanlage by u~ing a 
~crambll ng defense Ihat has become 
a Irademark for the learn. 

Despile hilling against a block 
Ihal had an average helghl of6· fool · 
6, U SO wa~ able 10 usc a crealive 
offen~ive allack thai featured quick 
set~ , off~reed kdb and allowed Ihe 
hillers 10 angle ,hot~ off Ihe block 
and oul of bounds. 

AI Ihe ~tart of Ihe fir~1 game, the 
Trilons did nOI look like a team Ihat 
was prerared 10 pull off its second 
improbable win In less Ihan a week. 
By the lIme SD Head Coach 
Duncan McFarland called a lime 
oul 10 sellie down his squad, Ihe 
4gers had jumped out 10 a seven-
poinl advanlage. 

A solo block by senior Matt 
Minehan and r ur con ecutive ~er­
vice poinls, including Iwo aces by 
senior ric Mai , allowed the1riton 
to claw back to wilhin IwO points. 
But Ihe Long Beach State frontline 
proved to be too slrong and clo ed 
out Ihe game, 15-9. 

"Ilhink wecameout a little over-
confident," seller Satao Minami said. 
"Bul we went back 10 our old style 
of play and sell led down." 

The old style of play seemed to 

~uil UCSD qUIte nicely , a~ Ihe leam 
found it~elf In a light bailie for the 
~ec()nd game. A~ they had in the 
fir!>t game, the 4ger~ again jumped 
out 10 an early lead. BUI thi~ lime, 
the Trilon~ were not aboul 10 go 
away a~ easily. 

After knolling Ihe ~core al 5-5, 
UCSD scored eighl unanswered 
POll1ts, including another Ihree-
waighl service poinls by Mai , who 
blasted Long Beach State wilh his 
powerful jump ~erve all night. 

With a comfortable lead, Ihe Tri r 
tons seemed to place Iheir game on 
crui econtrol and allowed the 4gers 
to fighl their way back inlo the game 
with five points or Iheir own. 01 
wanling to ee Ihe game slip away, 
McFarland called a time out to re-
mind the leam thai they had not won 
the game yet. UCSD responded by 
quickly closing out the game on 
kills by Yarri s and Mai. 

"I'm amazed by thi s team ," 
McFarland said. "There have been 
limes during Ihe season where a 
couple of things go wrong and we 
weren't able to recover, bUI lonight 
we were able to regain our compo-
sure and do the things thai we needed 
10 do." 

AI the start of Ihe third game, 
U SO was doing everything that it 
needed to do and more. The Tritons

Pressed into duty on the play, the 6-
