Quest For Statehouse:Brown Leads Flournoy " 

~ 
.. "", . 

:: . : 

by James G. Sofo 
Though some voters complain the candidates 

are, look and sound the same, the 1974 guber-
natorial ~ampaign has shown that the choice is 
clear cut in tomorrow's election . The electorate will 
choose between the dynamic and almost ascetic 

• Edmund G. Brown Jr. (lower left on page) and the 
efficient and deliberate Houston Flournoy (below) . 

For Jerry Brown the campaign has been just the 
latest episode in a meteoric rise to power. The 
former seminary student began his political career 
just six years ago when he ran for, and was the 
leading vote getter for, a seat on the Los Angeles 
Community College Board . In 1970 he became the 
only Democrat to win a state constitutional office 
when he was elected Secretary of State. Although 
Brown has managed to bruise the feelings of a few, 
his job as the Secretary of State has generally been 
regarded as one of the more dynamic and 
progressive performances in Sacramento for many 
years. From that point on, Brown became leading 
candidate for the Governor's mansion which was to 
be vacated at the end of Ronald Reagan's second 
term. 

When Brown entered the Spring primary last year 
he was considered to be the frontrunner only as 
long as the other candidates didn't campaign . Most 
polls figured that Brown didn't have the base to win 

. a statewide election . However most polls also 
figured that he didn't have the dynamic 
organization which managed~ to swamp the other 
candidates when the votes ~ere counted . 

Even before the primary was over Brown began to 
actively attack the Flournoy ~ampaign as just a 
continuation of the previous ~eagan years and to 
this day Houston Flournoy \ has had trouble 
separating himself from Reaga~ Nixon, Ford, and 
Watergate. MayDe because of thiS trouble Flournoy 
has had with people associating 'him with the evils 
of the Republican party he remains behind by a 
healthy margin in the polls. 

The latest Field Poll shows Brown leading 
Flournoy by 8% of the vote. Flournoy will have to 

ELECTION '74 

make an almost heraculan effort to erase this 
apparent Brown lead. 

Flournoy has had problems in his quest for the 
governors mansion since his campaign started. As 
late as a year ago Flournoy was the choice of only 
about 5 to 10% of Republican voters for Governor. 
Aided by Evelle Younger's decision not to run for 
governor and by the Indictment against Ed Reincke, 
Flournoy managed to win the primary h9ndily over 
Reinecke. However many Republicans didn't vote 
and still others will probably ignore party pleas of 
unity and won't vote tomorrow. Flournoy still must 
make gains in the ranks of Republican voters before 
he can hope to beat Brown . The latest F i Id Poll 
shows Flournoy only receiving 77% of the 
Republican vote. 

Still Flournoy is probably the best candidate the 
Republicans could put up against Brown. A sizable 
number of Democrats have been put off by Brown's 
brisk manner and have set up an organIzation of 
Democrats and Independents to assist Flournoy in 
his campaign . A great deal of that effort has been rn 
San DIego where hotel owner Larry Laurence, 
former big-man in the California Democratic party, 
has spent a lot of money and time setting up an 
organization . In Flournoy's San Diego headquar-
ters, half of the campaign workers are Democrats. 
Most of them presumably brought in by Larry 
Laurence. 

Flournoy has shown himself in the office of 
Controller to be an efficient and capable ad-
ministrator. He is generally considered to be the 
type of administrator who encourages a lot of 
input. On the other hand his campaign style and his 
own manner are quiet, pensive, and to some ob-
servers, plodding. 

Though there are issues of di~greement , spurting 
mainly from Flournoy's mild conservatism, the real 
issue in this campaign is who do the voters want as 
their next governor. An independent, dynamic, 
sometimes overbearing in his manner Jerry Brown 
or the deliberate, intellectual , careful to almost a 
point of indecision Houston Flournoy. 

GOP Faces National Defeat 

Photos by MMeol", A. S",;IIJ 

There is almost unanimous consent that the 
Republican party will suffer its greatest defeat since 
the the 1%4 Goldwater campaign . AI~hough in 
California the magnitude of that defeat may not be 
too overwhelming, the GOP is in serious danger of 
losing its already miniscule power on the national 
scene. 

The GOP has not had a good year in the overall 
national elections since 1966, when they greatly 
reduced the Democratic majority in President 

. Johnson's Great Society Congress. Although 
winning the last two presidential campaigns, 
Republicans have found it very difficult to elect 
local congressmen and governors This is not ex-
pected to improve in tomorrow's elections. 

The Republican collapse is expected to be 
especially obvious in gWernatorial races 
Democrats now control 32 of the 50 statehouses 
and even the most partisan Republican expect the 
Democrats to control at least 36 while Demo ratic 
hopes are high to control 40 or more of the 
governors seats. Republicans are expected to lose 
New York Massachusetts, and California and the 
race in Michigan is too close to call. It is possible 
that after tomorrow Democrats will control the .. 10 
largest states. Only in Alaska are Republicans 
expected to take a previously Democratic seat . 

Things are not eXp<'<'teo to improve tor 
Republicans In the Senate where Demo rat are 
expected to extend the number of controlled seats 
from 58 to 61 or 62. Though theoretically the 
Republicans hdve th~ l1Io)t 

seats with 20 Democrats up for re-electIon ' as 
opposed to only 14 Republ icans; Democrat have 
some of their strongest cagdidates running and 
Republicans have been haunted by the phantom of 
Watergate. Among the Republicans in trouble: 
Jacob Javits of New York, Robert Dole of Kansas, 
and Peter Dominick of Colorado. Republicans ha~ 
also been plagued by a number of retiring enators 
and in one case, the candal revolving around 
Edward Gurney. The mo t noteworthy D mocrat 
running scared is George McGovern of South 
Dakota, ampaigning again t former POW Leo 
Thor ness . The former pre id ntlal candidate has 
nild~rouble onvincing the folk back home that he 
has been working for South Dakota rather than 
running for pre ident. 

House races this year should prove to return an 
even heavier Democratic majorrty than now in 
Congress. Although Pr ~sident Ford has warned 
about veto-proof Hou e. most ob erver think the 
Democrat will pick up 25 to 35 seats leaving the 
Democrats about 10 sea_s shbrt of 268, the magic 
number. 

Republicans have been plagued by scandals, the 
poor tate of the economy, Watergate, the Nixon 
pardon, ann an unusually large numb~r of retirina 
representltive . Among the races wh .. re 
traditIonally .tfe Kepublican st'ats have come 
under attack I the 41st DIstrict here in San Dieao, 
where Colleen O'Conner has made national news In 
her trugglE' to unseat the highly popular Bob 
Wllon.

Yes on "0" 

In the March Del Mar City Council Election, the 
majority of our community voted for a controlled 
growth philosophy in the hope of saving the 
openness and beauty of our coastal environment. 
The City Council and the citizens of Del Mar are 
now faced with the challenge of making that ideal a 
reality. 

The Council has delayed, by the imposition of a 
construction moratorium , the destruction of our 
prime open spaces pending a decision by the 
citizens on which land shou ld be spared from 
development. That decision is almost made and the 
city must now develop a mechanism for acquirjng 
those critica l areas which can be protected only by 
outright purchase. 

The cost of acquiring even a modest amount of 
publ ic open space is staggering 'Ind under our 
present General Law structure of government, a 
disproportionate share of the cost will be paid by 
the property taxpayer, the homeowner and the 
rentor. 

Proposition "0" on tomorrow's ballot will expand 
the city government to full charter status, thus 
removing the constraints imposed by the state 
legislature on General Law cities. Proposition "0" 
will enable the city to more equitably distribute t~e 
tax burden. 

For example, a retailer pays his own way in Del 
Mar by contributing sales tax revenue. In the office 
next door, a business which does not sell goods 
profits equally from doing business in Del Mar. Yet 
the non-retail business pays on ly a sma ll business 
license tax and carries only a fraction of its fair 
share of the municipal fiscal burden . Proposition 
"0" would make it possible for the council to end 
this fiscal free-loading. 

A large scale developer profits from building in 
Del Mar. Yet he go s untaxed on his sales, even 
though the amenities of Del Mar contribute to 
make his project lucrative. Proposition "0" would 
make it possible to require development to con-
tribute to the maintenance of community 
amenities- to pay its own way. 

It IS not difficult to understand why the pro-
development interests in the city oppose 
Proposition "0". Similarly, it is understandable that 
the Chamber of Commerce is in opposition since 
the amendment aims at the pocket book of some of 
ItS constituency. 

The advantages of full charter status for the city 
extend well beyond the equitable distribution of tax 
burdens. The present limited General Law status Qf 
the city has resulted in our campaign spending 
limitations being pre-empted by the state 
legislature. thus eliminating our spending ceiling. 
Full charterstatus would allow us to reimpose these 
limitations VYhich have insured simple, low-key 
political campaigns in Del Mar. 

Finally, PropoSition "0" will not make it possible 
for the city to create taxes that will create long-term 
obligations . With or without a charter amendment, 
all lorg-,term obligations require a vote of the 
peopl . 

As t~e Del Mar Surfcomber editoriali zed 
Thursaay, " Del Mar residents made a choice when 
they ei cted a city counci l to limit development 
and til provide more property for public use 
through ac~u!,itinn of property, and development 
of par s instead of buildings." 

" PrepoSition "0" amounts to faith in government-
'-a faitl, ot shared in most cities in America these 

day~ . ,t doesn't give the city a blank check to do 
what if ~ishes, but It does provide the council with 
more Jdwer." 

"That power should be granted by Del Mar voters 
Tuesday." 

Councilm mbers John Weare, Nancy Hoov r, 
Richard Rypinski and myself encouragE' you to help 

triton times 

make our community goals a reality. Vote Yes on 
Proposition "0" on Tuesday . 

Tom Shepard 

Mayor, City of Del Mar

porting Proposition "0" from Del Mar Coun-
cilmembers Weare and Hoover.-Ed. Dir. 

Own Eyes 
I am concerned about the tactics of the Flournoy 

campaign, in particular a pamphlet published by 
FlournoyJhis pamphlet has a list of dates, and what 
each candidate was doing during that time period. 
(This ad was also in the San Diego Union, Oct. 23.) 

In 1955, while Flournoy was a legislative assistant 
to a senator, Brown began studies in a seminary. 
(You m an he believes in God?) In 1960, Flournoy 
was elected to the State Assembly, while Brown 
discontinued his priesthood studies. (Why did he 
stay 5 years?) In 1962, Flournoy was re-clected t(,> 
the Assembly while Brown participated in civ il 
rights marches In, the South . (Who needs rights?) 

In 1967, Flournoy initiated reforms of the con-
troller's office, while Brown protested the death 
penalty . (How cou ld he? 'yVe should shoot them all.) ' 
In 1969, while Flournoy was busy increasing trye 
efficiency of his office, Brown had the nerve and 
audacity to march with Cesar Chave£. (Why should 
he bother? He's not a Mexican farmworker .) To (op 
It off, in 1974 Flournoy won his nomination with 63 
rercent of the vote, while Brown could only muster· 
up 38 percent. (Shh! Let's not Jell them Flournoy's 
major opponent was under an indictment, then .) 

In conc lusion , as I near e lection day, it is fairly 
obVIOUS to me (or Flournoy makes it seem that way) 
that a man who has had the courag0 to try the 
seminary (he su rely didn't do it to make a name for 
himself), who cared enough for the problems of 
blacks to march in civil rights mar hes, who cared 

nough about the treatment of farm workers to 
march with Cesar Chavez, and has a definite feeling 
against killing a person, that this man could not be 
a good leader. 

Should we vote for a person who has seen with 
his own eyes the problems, talked to the people, 
and tried to do something about their probl ms, or 
should we vote for a man who sits behind hi s desk 
and reads the newspapers to see the problems? 

Drinking 
Dilemma 

G.l. Barnes 

Our two major-party gubernatorial candidates 
have demonstrated to m that they are nothing 
more than the politicians whom we all speak of 
today with a bad taste in our mouths. 

I refer you to the fact that they both are in favor 
of lowering the drinking age to 18 from the present 
21 . ThiS, as I see it, is a oiatant appeal to the young 
people for their vote, In lieu of their safety. 

I cannot believe that If the concern of the state 
(i .e., the people of the state) was the deClf;jing 
factor in their deCiSions, that either of the can-
didates would support this legislation. To think that 
this law, if passed, would not put more drunk 
driv rs on the road, drivers with less drivmg 'ex-
perience than most would be to d ny th obvious .

In the Eastern states, where the 18-year mi . 
nrinking age is the rule rather than the exception, 
the accident rate, and more significantly, the 
accident rate of 18-21 YPiIr- olds has risen 
clramatically. Not coincidentally, this rate increase 
for each state closely parallels the rhange in the 
minimum drinking agE' in timing. 

Cali fornia , with the nation's largest auto 
population, and highest miles of freeway per capita 
(ould only su ffer a simi lar fate . 

It either Brown or Flournoy cared for the safety of 
thC' pC'ople of the state more than they do about 
waYlng a voting block, they would oppose this 

hazardous proposal, as I do.

At stake tomorrow are four minor statewide office races : Lieutenant 

Governor, Secretary of State, Controller, and Treasurer; these are 
mainly administrative offices with quiet power in terms of shaping 
California for the next four years. Yet they are Significant for one 
reason glaringly apparent this year-they are full of politicians on the 
way up or trying to retrieve a rung on the political ladder. 

One fact points to the oesirabillty of serving a four-year or more 
apprenticeship In the wasteland of California politics. Both candidates 
for governor this year, Edmund G. Brown Jr., and Houston I. rlournoy, 
currently hold offices in this group. 

The two leaders for lieutenant Governor are uccessful veterans of 
the California legislature. Mervyn M. Dymally became the first black 
state senator in state history in 1967. John Harmf'r has been a state 
senator since 1966. Gov. Reagan appointt"d him LiE'utenant Governor 
after [d Reinicke wa's convicted of [lE'rjury. 

Dymally and Harmer find themselves opposed on most Issues. 
Dymally voted for, and Harmer against-the housing ('onstruction bill, 
additional property tax relief for seniors, early childhood education. 
expanding the school lunch program, the equal rights amendmE'nt, 
outlawing strikebreakers and lowering the voting age to 18. 

Harmer voted for, and Dymally against-rE'instating the death 
penalty, stricter punishment for rape and burglary, prohibiting 
mandatory bUSing for racial integration, limiting single campaign 
("ontributions to $25,000, a one-timE' incomt" tax cut and welfare 
reform . 

Seeking the Secretary of State's office are Democrat March Fong, 
Republican Brian Van Camp, Peace and Freedom Kay McGlachlin and 
AlP Charles C. Ripley. 

For Controller. AI P Kevin Scanlon, Democrat Kenneth Cory, P&F 
Corey D. Cassanova, and Republican William T. Bagley are vying for 
the position which includes collecting state income tax and ac-
('ounting and disburSing the state's money. 

And the Treasurer's race sees the omeback of one-time Assembly 
Sl)('aker. unsuccessful candidate for governor and California boss JE'sse 
Unruh, wh~ facE'S John Kehoe .

F our Props Affect University 
by Malcolm A. Smith 

Measures on tomorrow's ballot include 
propositions that could put a student on the Board 
of RE'gents, shorten Regents' terms and transfer 
the power to It"vy tuition to the Legislature. 

PropositIon 4 proposes shortening the Regents' 
terms from the present 16 years to 12 years, and 
would allow the Regents to appoint one student 
and one faculty member . The m asure requires 
that the Regents reflect the "economic, cu ltural 
and social diversity of the state, including ethnic 
minorities and women ." Included is the establish-
ment of a selection ('ommittee with which the 
Governor would have to consult before ap-
pointing Regents . 

This proposal, which is supported by the 
Regents, is designed to make the Board of 
Regents, and thus the UC system, more in touch 
with the needs and aspirations of the people of 
the state of California. Opponents object to the 
provision that removes the vote of the State's 
second largest economic interest (agricu lture) 
from the Board, to the provision adding a second 
alumni member, and to the possibility of adding a 
student to the board . It should be noted that the 
studE'nt is only appointed if the regents choose to 
do so. The Regents would control the process by

Proposition 16 transfE'rs the power to deCide the 

level of tuition for the U system from the Hoard 
of Regents to the statE' Le~islatllre . Th,s 
proPOSition is not opposed by Uc. but ItS op-
[lonents fear a tax increaS(', for they ar(' working 
on the assumption that the legislature will abolish 
tuition , thus forCing a tax Increase to gain 
alternative revenue Proponents of the measure 
feel that all power to raise revenue (lncl~dlng 
tuition) should be 10 the hands of one body, the 
legislature. 

Proposition 14 merely adds the PrE' sId nt Pro 
Tempore of the Senate to the Board of Trustees for 
the California ~tatl' UnlvE'rslty and College 

~yst('m, which Incrpasps Its memberhsip from 21 
to 22. This would provide a balance of nwmbers 
from the legislative and executive branches. since 
th President Pro Tempore would lOin the SpE'aker 
of the Assembly, as legislative representatIves, 
balanCing the Governor and the Lt Governor, as 
representatives of the xecut,ve branch . 

Proposition 3 exempts the chief adminIstratIve 
officer and three deputl s of the California 
Postsecondary Education Commission from Civil 
service regulation .

Two propo$itions on Tuesday's 
I>.IIot if pUsed will alter the 
make-up of t.he San Dieao County 
Board of SU))ef'Visors, while a city 
c~er question asks if the mayor 
arid city councilmembers be 
required to not hold outside jobs. 

County charter Prop . A 
stipulates increasing the number 
of supervisorial districts and the 
number of supervisors to 7 from 
the present 5. Proponents argue 
that Prop. A would result in 
greater opportunities for 
representation from minorities, 
would make it easier to have a 
quorum at board of supervisors' 
meetings, and better distribute 
the workload incurred by each 
supervisor. 

Opponents believe that Prop. 
A, if passed, would increase the 
cost of government and challenge 
the contention,that an increase in 
supervisors would increase 
minority representation on the 
board . ' 

County Prop. B would require 
that at least two supervisorial 
districts comprise areas outside of 
the City of San Diego. Its intent is 
to prevent the city of San Diego 
from dominating the board of 
supervisors. It is supported by all 
five supervisors. 

City charter changes include 
Prop. l , which would require the 
mayor and counci lmembers of 
the City of San Diego to not hold 
outside employment during their 
term of office. Proponents 
believe such a measure would 
prevent interference of business 
and professional interest, and 
allow councilmembers to devote 
more attention to the duties of 
their office. 

Opponents believe, however, 
that Prop. l, if enacted would be 
legally difficult to uphold and 
\\OlIld discourage working people 
from running for office. 

City Prop. M would limA the 
five-point credit given to veteran! 
on Civil Service tests to five years, 
thus allowing public jobs to be 
made more available to a wider 
spectrum of applicants. 

Opponents argue that WWII 
and Korea veterans would no 
longer receive the credit, which 
'MJuld be an erosion of traditional 
benefits for veterans.
