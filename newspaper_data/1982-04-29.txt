Editor: 

In an weringC.B. Crocker's 
at tack on Ground Zero it is 
n ce ary first to clarify one 
point he made rather muddy. 
The idea of nuclear freeze and 
uni lateral disarmament are 
quite different. Whi le there i~ 
certainly talk of u nilateral 
disarmament, the majority of 
serious discus 'ion and the 
proposals being voted on m 
various states deal with a 
freeze on new weapons 
followed by serious negot i· 
ation toward arms reduction. 
The tOPIC being examined i~ 
the overall logIC (not to 
ment ion t he morality) of our 
ruinously expensive arm~ 
buildup. The AdminIstration 
and Mr. Crocker express the 
fear that the oviet Unton 
might achIeve 1/llclear

news letter, "publishers have 
begun to hhi ft their attent IOn 
from coy 19·year·old girls to

As our reporter John 
RIccardi disco\ered, the 
heroine of the latest romances 
IS usuallv career-oriented. 
occaSIonally dl\ orced or 
WIdowed and not the type to 
get pushed around by a man. 
"None of us ever liked heroines

new hero's love for the new

to spend his or her own money, a right 
that was taken from the students, 
Surely you have a better claim to your 
money that the A Council does. right? 

But t he A Council doesn't think so. 
They voted to keep this measure off the 
ba llot. I guess t hat they didn't want to 

The issue is not how the 
money is spent, but where. 

bu rden us with the responsibility of 
spending our own money. If ·the fee 
were made voluntary then student 
organizations wou ld be responsible to 
the student body for support, not to 
their friends on th AS Council. It 
\ ... ·ould also mean that students would 
have the choice as to whether or not 
the} want to fu nd political boycotts 
(e.g. estle.) or the new indicator. 

Perhaps some students object to 
having their money spent on religIOUS 
organ izat ions like the Mos lem Student 
Society or the Campus Crusade for 
Chri st. Perhap~ some people in those 
organizations object to subsidizing 
L. A,G,O. There is no question that 
each of these organization ha ' the 
right to fun ct ion on campus, but why 
s hould your money go to political and 
religiou act iv itie with which you 
mayor may not agree? Why , hou ld 
atheists fund Christians, Chri tians 
fu nd homosexuals and liberals fund 
conservat ives? 

There is a controversy brewi"gamong 
the members of the AS UCSD regarding 
the referendum to make the student 
activity fee volu II tory , The $8 charge 
supports over 150 student organizations 
and making it voluntary, according to 

0, is it feasible? A fact often 
overlooked by t heopposition is that the 
fee was at one time voluntary (i.e. it has 
worked). Claiming to represent the 
interests of the tudents better than 
the students themselves. our fearless 
leaders made it mandatory . An A card 
is just one of the many methods that 
might be u. ed. The purchase of such a 
card, which could act as a "ticket" to 
A, activities, would eliminate the 
"free loader" problem. 0 what\, the 
problem? Why dId the A Council 
r fuse to even let the students vote on 
this issue? 

The fact is that they would justlo\e

Con 
The voluntary ActiVIty Fee 

Referendum. If pa~sed. will effectivel) 
destroy the A'osoclated Students' 
government and curtail any programs 
and orgalllzations it supports, Past 
experience with voluntary fees has 
proved t hat a large portIon of students 
do not pay them and yet expect to 
benefit from the services pro\ided by 
those who choose to contrIbute. 
Proposition 13 IS an example of thIS 
effect whereby the voters seek 
immediate monetar} relief yet are 
hocked at the los of servIces VItal to 

maintaining theIr quality of lIfe 

some, would cut the AS funds 
drastically . Others soy that stud,"ts 
have a right to decide what to do with 
their money. In an effort to beller inform 
the students in this maiter, Th e 
Guardia11 ;s presentillg both sides. 

It is also clear that t h~ current A. IS 
at l ea~t in part to blame for the loss of 
confidence in the mandated fee , as 
certalll individuals on the CouncIl 
have spent student funds to further 
their own politIcal ambItIon". ThIS 
careles"ness wit h our money mllst stop 
and t he best \\,'a~ to accomplIsh that IS 
to throw the rascals out! 
Disembodying the only source of 
student·directed social life and 
academic admcacy on campus is 
tantamount to throwing the baby out 
\\ith th bathwater, 

Another important and Illtle kncm n 
fact concerning the Issue IS who 
-;ponsored the referendum. Contrary 

coming soon to the 

to popular belIef. it was not a 1(J<lse 
coalItIOn of interested student .... but an

AS gives a forum, and only a few show up 

Lacking bot h candidates 
and pectators, th fir t day of 
the annu al AS Ca nd idate 
For um was a n apparent 
tes t ame n t t o !>tude n t 
ind ifference towa rd UCSD 
elect ions. At noon on Tuesday, 
Apr il 27, Deni se Long, the AS 
Comm issioner of Elections, 
welcomed a sparse lunchtime 
crowd at Revelle Plaza to the 
forum which featured four 
candidat s - L e Anderson 
(Academic Affairs ), Josh 
Harris (President), Lisa 

ten mark (Ext rnal Affairs), 
an d Henry Chu (PresidenL) , -

two "no shows" Marc Geiger 
(Pub lic Re latio n s) and 
Ama nda White ( tudent 
Welfare), and an appeal for the 
campus act ivity fee referen-
dum. 

A crowd of about sevent v 
witnessed the short. rather 
standard speeches and the 
absenteeism . Remarked Long, 
"We expected a bad turnout on 
a Tuesday. We're sad the 
candidates didn't come. didn 't 
commit themselves to the 
program. 

But Long's office i" 
committed, having already 

cited four violators of the 
elecllon codes. Programming 
candidate DaVid Parker was 
cited for not attending a 
mandatory candidat e's 
meeting last week. just like 
presidential candidC:lte Henry 
Chu, the ' tudent Action and 
new Deal slates campaigned 
ea r h - before t he offiCIal 
hour, and their expen... form" 
\\ere turned in . The Student 
Action late had Circulated a 
flter which outlined their 
platform, while callmg for 
intere!-oted per~ons to ..,ign up 
as candidates. In acklilion , the 

New $35,000 contract is in 
the \Vorks for UCSD's KSDT 

By DAN OTTO 
A new contract. prO\'iding 

up to $35,000 per year, is 
pendi ng for K DT, the 
student·run campus radio 
station. Final ratificat Ion of 
the contract rests on whet her 
or not an acceptable mode of 
tran"ml!:>Slon can be found for 
the station. joe Watson, vice 
chancellor of undergraduate 
affairs, has organized a 
committee to deCIde what new 
medium is most feasible in 
\'iew of budgetary and 
licensing restrict ions. If the 
proper broadcasting medium 
can beobtai ned, it is likelv (hat 
th contract will be signed. 
putting an end to over a year of 
financial disputes be(weeen 
KSDT and the ASUCSD. 

Currently, K 01' broad-
cas t through the ca ble 
networks of outhwestern 
and Cox cable companie • . 
neit her of which has cable run 
through the cam pus. Under 
t he pro po!:>e d co nt r a ct, 
stu dents at UC D must have 
easy access to KSOT's 
programs. T here are basically 
three so lutio n s to t h is 
problem: running cable 
through the UCSO campus, 

obt aming an F.\1 license or 
obtaining an AM !tcense. 

Initia l cst imatcs show the 
cable route to be extremelv 
expensive and an FM license i· ... 
all but unobtainable in San 
Diego at present. There IS a 
po;,slbtlity that ne\\ A;\.1 
carner current faCllttle" could 
be purchased as a replacement 
for the statIOn's pre ... ent 
equipment. However, acmr 
ding to Tricia I~u..,..,o, AS 
commissioner of communica 
tions, UC ' D IS about the onh 
UC campus wahout some kind 
of broadcasllng licen 'e. 

K 01' IS currently opera-
ting wjthout a contract and 
receives a monthly A 
allotment of, 500. For 1981-82, 
t he AS originally earmarked 
$10,000 for KSDT. Due to the 
unavai labi lt lY to students of 
K OT's programs, the 
absence of a contract and an 
incident i n vo l vi n g an 
interview With Tom Metzger, 
one of the Ku Klux Klan's 
Grand Dr agons, the $10,000 
was subsequent ly frozen b~ 
A President Jules Bagneris. 
Thus, KSDT was left with 
virtuallv no budget.

6 The UC~D Guardian Thursday, Apri l 29, 1982 

Presidential hopefuls are asked questions 
Henry 
Chu 

Chu, asidefrom beilllflhuurrelli 
AS Commisslmler of Academic 
Aj/airs, and from crealing Ihe 
Leclor ole Series, is also a member 
of the Muir Col/ege Revieu' alld 
De,'elopmelll &ard, He is runnillg 
independently. 

What should the political 
philosophy of the AS CSD 
be? For example, should it act 
as a watch dog of the 
administration? Should it 
focus its energies toward its 
own financial matters? Etc. 

Many student have expres, ed 
t he opinion that the A UC D 
Council has delved into too many 
issues where they realistically 
have little effect. My philosophy is 
that we should focus on issues 
which directly affect the students 
of UC O. Changes by the 
administration in academiC 
policies. educational fees , hou~ing 
costs and other things are areas 
that must be constantly 
mOOitored by the A UCSO to 
insure that the student body is 
benefited. As president I will 
make certain that the counCi l will 
spend time only on important 
Issues which affect the student s 
of UC O. 

Do you support the boycotts 
of off-campus organizations, 
such as Coors and / or Nestle's 
products? 

The AS Council voted to 
support a Coor's and Nestle's 
boycott , but the net effecl of this 
action has little Significance in the 
o\erall pIcture. I'm not say 109 the 
Issues were not Important , but the 

ASUCSD cannot alford to spend 
laborious hours on worldwide 
topics. The A UCSD can render 
a n opi ni on from limited 
information, but it cannot expect 
to receive immediate po itlve 
results. Issues and programs that 
penain directly to lJCSD students 
must have a higher priority than 
topics that apply to everyone. The 
AS should focus on helping 
students and not t he world, 

Do you support AS funding 
for the Lesbian and Gay 
Organization (LAGO)? 

The Lesbian and Gav 
Organization (LAGO) has bee'n 
funded for several years by the 
ASUCS.o. They have e\er)' right 
to receive an allocation as any 
other AS organIZation to have 
programs and activities . In fact. 
they have been one of the few 
organizations that has spent its 
money in an efflt' lent and 
beneficial fashion. 

Do you support having a 
voluntary $8 Activity Fee? 

A \oluntary R actlvlly fee 
would be detnmental to the 
ASl'C D as II i~structured today. 
TG's would become a thing of the 
past. Many organizatIOns would 
be smcken with a loss of funds 
(which would make question 3 a 
mool point) For the good of the 
O\erall student bodv I cannot see 
making the $8 mandatory actl\'itv 
fee a \'olunlary one. • 

Adam 
Forest 

Forl'sl has bee/I a /l/ember of Ihe 
[,op £,'e llis Col/cerl Commlt/eejor 
Ihrpe years. has bel'll ro'rhairoflhe 

Pop EI'enls Collcerl Commillee/or 
lu'o Quarlers. and is presently Ih e 
A ['rof,franmlinf,f COli/missioner. 
He is leat/inK Ihe Forest/Adams 
slale. 

What s hou ld the politica l 
philosoph y of the AS C 0 
be? For example. should it act 
as a watch dog of t he 
administ ration? hould it 
focus its energies toward its 
own financial matters? Etc. 

The political philosophy of the 
ASUC D should be to prima rily 
concern itself with issues that 
directlv affect ~tudents. In the 
coming year, thl~ wlllmclude the 
financial aid dilemma, the long 
neglected quality of food in the 
cafetenas, the increasmg problem 
of park lOgon campu5and the need 
for a student organizations, 
mone 'dance, etc. multipurpose 
room . 

The AS should always make an 
attempt to work With, rather than 
against, the administration. 
Obviously, this is not always 
poSSible, but the attempt shou ld 
always be made. An example of 
where cooperations must occur, is 
with the acqUisition of the 
muilipurpose room. This room 
will be very costly to const ruct 
and Without the admmlstrat IOn's 
aid. thiS multipurpose room plan 
cou ld fade away, just as the 
amphitheatre plan did ju, t two 
years ago. The A UCSD must be 
strong and cohe<,lve to attain lis 
goals. 

Do you supp ort the boycotts 
of off·campus organizat ion s. 
s uch as Coors a nd or Nestle's 
products? 

It IS trul' that boycotts of 
organizatIOns such as Coors and 
Ne tie may be beneficial. in that 
they raise the political 
consCiousness of the ~tudent 
body, I feel that the student body 

should be kept well informed and 
t hat the Associa ted SI udent s 
council should make a strong 
at t emp t to keep everyo n e 
informed as long as the fi nancia l 
burden doe n't reach an exce~s. 
Fl yers and factual information 
leaflets are relatively inexpensive 
and just serve to mform students, 
but new. paper adverti sing and 
the time spent on a boycott can 
become costly. In the specific 
example of Coors. a substitute 
beer is very easi ly obtained, thus 
making a boycott easy to 
implement . at no cost to the 
s tudents. Gett ing involved beyond 
just avoiding Coors can get co!>t l} 
and should nOI be pursued. In 
conclUSIOn. a boycott should only 
be undertaken in the best intere"t 
of the students. If the boycott 
doesn't affect the majority of 
student!> in the shorl or long 
run. then nomonevortime , hould 
be mvested. ' 

Do you support AS funding 
for the Lesbian and Gay 
Organization (LAGO)? 

Ye;o I see no reason why LAGO 
should be bingled out from the 
many other student organi7a' 
tions . LAGO is an orgaOlzatlOn 
just like any other and should be 
funded just like any other, I.e. 
through the appropriate activity 
fee commmission cha nnels. 

Do you s upport having a 
voluntary $8 Activity Fee? 

The campus Activity Fee makes 
up the financial element 
nece!>sary for the ASSOCiated 

tudents to function. I feel a 
voluntary activity fee rather than 
the present mandatory fee will 
lead to the deterioration of the 
Associated Students. From past 

~tatistics. only 30 percent of the 
tudent body pays the voluntary 

Calpirg fee . If the campus activity 
fee were to become voluntary I 

could easily visualize only 30 
percent of the student body paying 
the fee. Our activity fee is used to 
fund all student organizations. 
TGIF's, etc. It seems ridiculous to 
vote for the inst it ut Ion of a 
voluntary fee system when just 
la),t year st udents voted for a two 
dollar increase of their activity 
fees . Please understand that the 
students voted for thiS actl vity fee 
increase by exactly the same 
mean s now being used for the 
proposed voluntary activity fee. a 
referendum . In short, in this 
period of need for an expanded 
number of activities, to vote for a 
proposal that will curtail 
acti~ities is clearly agamst the 
intere:,ts of the majority of the 
students.

What should the political 
philosophy of the A UC D 
be? For example. should it act 
as a watch dog of the 
administration? Should it 
focu s its energies toward its 
own financial matters? Etc. 

It is of my opinion that the 
Associated Student Government 
at our University should conduct 
it. elf in a businesslike manner. 

In the real world. people invest 
their mOllles with expectations of 
making a profit. I believe that 
),tudents at UC D expect the 
same. The only difference is that

iii:; £millenU the Tai Situ Rillpocfze 
An unusual opportunity exists to experience the tuchings of one of Tibet's 

gre.Jtest lamas. The present Tai Situ Rinpoche is the twelfth in the line ofTai Situ 
Pas recognized by /1is /1oliness the 16th Karmapa. /1e is an emanation of the future 
Buddha !'faitreya. whose qualities of love and compassion are evident in all his 
words and acts. 

Tai Situ Rinpoche was born in Xham. Tibet. in 1954. !'fany extraordinary and 
wonderful events hera lded and accompanied this auspicious birth. At the age of 18 
months, Rinpoche was enthroned at Palpung !'fonastery. which is the head of IBO 
grand monasteries and over 1000 subsidiary monasteries, 

Particularly skilled in using visual art music and poetry to express the richness 
of his spiTtual inheritance. Rinpoche also speaks directly to the problems of 
Western students in a unique and creative way. His presence touches everyone and 
conveys wilh natural clarity and magnificence the universal teachings of the 
Dhanna.

For myself (CommiSSIOner of

We ha ve to care forthe student s

I he people of the \\'orld There are 
many severe problems e'\lsting 
here that must be addrt'~scd and I 
would use the malorit v of 1m 
energy to do so. With a defiClenc~ 
10 all lampu~ evcnt s thl' A~

Boycotts 'uch as Coors and 
Nestles are Important but thl' AS 
can only do ~o much. However. if

Do you s uppOrt AS fu nding

The Le~blan and Gar 
Organization offers many 
,en'lces, ~urh as psychologICal 
rou n"eling referrals , which 
benefll a number of p<"ople -at 
l'CSD. 

For mv"elf and the rest of thl' 
New Deal. funding for thl" 
organ l7atlOn would rest primarily 
on how efficient Iv these scrnccs 
are created and niallltamed , 

More specifically. iff wen.' to 

questioned 
analY7e allocat IOns for next year, I 
would examine LACO's track 
reeord (just as I would do wit h any 
other ~tudent organizatl(m). In 
LAGO's case 11 happen~ to be \Cry 
~()()d, their ad\crt ISlllg I S effect I ve.

don't want the s tudents to

made voluntary. then those 
activities that the students 
really supported would get 
funded anyway. The onl y 
possib le justification for 
having the fee mandatory is to 
do someth ing with the money 
that t he majority of students 
don 't want to see done with it. 

The major issue involved is 
not how the money is spent. 
but where it comes from . For, 
as longas the fee is mandatory, 
mi managemen t and waste 
are a ll but inevitable. When 
the coffers are automatically 
filled every quarter, what 
inspires the AS to really 
inform the students aoout 
what's going on? W hat

your money; what gi ves

Do you support AS fund in g 
fo r the Lesbia n a nd Gay 
Organ iza tion (LA GO)? 

My view on this Question is thai 
the organizatIOn mentioned In the 
<]uestion conSIders itself a 
minority organization. Funding is 
pro\ided other campu" minority 
organizations s uch as, BSA . 
MECIIA , and ASian Student 
Alliance. Therefore, Jt would he 
unfair to single out one minont} 
group. If, however, t he council 
decides that funds should not be 
allocated 10 any organizatlun. I 
would abide by the decision . 

Do you "upport having a

No. In order 10 have an effecll\'('

What bhould the political 
philosophy of the ASUCSD 
be? For example, !.hould it act 
as a walch dog of lhe 
admini.,tration? hould it 
focus its energies toward its 
own fina n cial matters? Etc. 

The polItical philosophy uf the 
A ~hould neither be as a 

watchdog of the admmlstration 
nor as an arm of radical politics. 
Rather. the AS s hould con 
centrate it power and energy 
on the financIal matter s of this 
campus. Above a nd beyond any 
other purJX)se or goal. the AS 
serve" a~ treasu rer and guardian 
of ~t udent funds . It s concern 
should lie with ~ervtng as many 
people as possible so that the

vacuum, so a certam amount ()f 
money must be spent on acquiring 
polilical information t hat could 
affecl each and ever} s tudent. 

As far as bemg a watchdug IS 
concerned. It IS ()U t of I he 
questIOn, Thl~ year's AS spent 
more time fIghting the 
admlnliotratlon than workmg 
wllh It and consequt'ntly ltttle

ourseh'es with certain faceh of

gam the support desperately 
needed for a <;uccessful AS. 

Do you support the boycott., 
of off·campu" organization", 
such as Coors and / or NebtIe'"

feat that hIghly influential art dealer 
Leo Castelli is celebrating the 25t h

Fu n Boy Three 
Fun Boy Three 
Chry<;alis 

By DOUG MITH 
Starf Wri •• 'r 

When punk rock died In 
England, few felt t hat this 
nihilist IC ty pe of musIc had not 
run its course. ka, or t\\'o-
tone music, oon came into 
vogue and made music fun 
again. ka's early leaders were 

The UCSD Guardian 

A Specials sound frODl Fun 
Boy Three; also a J aDl 'Gift' 
The Special ' , and their 
success made it po, sible for 
such band as The elector, 
Madness and the English Beat 
to gain fame. 

Perhaps The peciab' 
greatest hit was "Ghost 
Town," a commentary on 
England during last year's 
race riots . Relea oed on an EP 
with "Why" and " Friday, 
Night. aturday Morning,' 
two exccptionally strong 
statements on Brit ish ~',ocial 
life. the EP "Ghost Town" wa 
thought by many to be an 
Indication of the future 
greatness that lay ahead of 
The pecials. Unfortunately, 
the band ",oon disbanded 
because of "arti . tic differ-
ences." 

Three former pecials, 

Terry Hall, Neville Staples 
and Lynval Golding, have 
rejoined to form the band, Fun 
Boy Three. Though this trio 
still retains some of the same 
cleverness exhibited on past 

pecials a lbums, Fun Boy 
Three is not to be confused 
with the former band. 

While earlier Specials songs 
had thaI bouncy sound that 
can only be de cribed as sort of 
fu n k i fied reggae, FilII Hoy 
Three unfortunately emerges 
as t he collect he work of three 
guys who hm'e not really 
decided what to do \ovith their 
new found artistic indepen-
dence. This really det racts 
from any cohesi\cness that 
the alhum might ha\'e 
possessed. Maybe Fun Boy 
Three's Terry Ha II will get 
o\'er his preoccupat ion wit h 
jungle beats. aka 'Tarzan ' 
music. Don't gi\'e up on hiS 
band, though. They may be till' 
only emminently qualified 
new music proponent ...... till in 
England who ha\cn't left for 
Nt'w York.

previou efforts render The 
Gilt somewhat of a disap-
poin tment; it is errat ic and 
con tains more clinkers than 
any of it predeces ors, Sti ll , it 
is more su bstant ial. musically 
and lyrically , than most of the 
current rock productions. 

The album begins with a 
startling, echo-twisted 
scream, followed by the quick-
throb ba s lineintroto "Happy 
Together. " This is not a cover 
of the old Turtles hit , but an 
aggressive rocker, fairly 
typical of this band's earlv 
who - gone - punk - and - back 
again ver ' ion of the Big Beat. 
Next is "Ghosts," hand-clap 
and snare propelles, minus the 
high yol u me hooks of 
"Happy," but contamingsome 
of the most poignant vocals 
that singer/ songwriter/guI-
tarist Paul Wcller has ever 
recorded. 

So far, so good .,, ~.,'reat even! 
But the next song bombs -
"Precious" is a lame slab of 
white-boy disco complete with 
annoyingly wah-wahed 
rhythm guitar and the album 
nevcr com pletely recovers . 
The remaining eight songs 
range from typically loud-but-
melodic rockers to a pointless 
instrumental and a couple of 
gratll1g rhythm and nOIse 
experiments. 

The music is alwa\s 
competent - the band (Weller,

Korean folk Inusic, 
dances and rituals 

The colorful rituals of the 
ancient Korean court as well 
as folk mu ic and dance will be 
recreated as part of INTER-
CON '82 by AAK, Korean Folk 
Music and Dance Ensemble, 
Saturday, 8 p.m" Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

The mu ic and dances of the 
court were meticulousl y 
pre erved by means of a 
teacher-to-pupil tradition 
based on careful memoriza-
tion. The repertoire was kept 
alive over the centu ries by 
hereditary guilds of profes-
sional musicians and by the 
groups of court nobles whose 
pleasure it wa to maintain the 
tradition outside the court for 
their own entertainment. 

The Korean folk music 
tradition comprises various 
genres of vocal and solo or 
instrumental ensembles. The 
arti tic character of Korean 
folk music lies in a diversity of 
subt le melodic lines and 
sop hi ticated rhythmic 
configuratio ns. Popular 
dramatic folk talcs, called 
p 'ansori, are performed by a 
SI ngl e singer-narrator 
accompanied by a drummer, 
the soloi st often indicating 
dramatic actions with 
gestures and using a fan and 
handkerch ief as props . 

This trou pe of 25 performers 
is from the National Cia sical 
Mu ic In titute of Korea, the 
direct descendent of the court 
ensemble of the Yi household . 
The performers will prcsent 
court musIc and dance as they 
have been performed in Korea 
for almost 1,000 years, givlOg 
A merican audiences an 
exciting opportunity to 
experience the~e unique and 

elaborate court ceremonies. 
The Korean court music 

tradition is among the earliest 
in A ia, dating back to the 
establishment of formal 
diplomatic contacts bet ween 
Korea and China. 

The ritual court dancc of 
Korea is a solemn pagean t of 
stately grace and controlled 
emotion. Dancers dressed in 
s ilk costumes of brilliant hue 
appear to float form pattern to 
pattern in a serene flow of 
colorful movement.

A s \Vimtning superstar 
Freshman Lee Morrow has set a national record 

By THOMA CHMIDT 
Staff Wriler 

Last Thursday , had the 
opportuni ty to int erview my 
first "supers tar" at UCSD. 
With though ts and ill usions of 
David Brinkley, my cassette 
recorder in hand. I brayely 
made my way to the UCSD 
Natatorium. My fi rst problem 
was to blindly pick Lee 
Morrow, "swimmer extraor-
dinaire." out of the mass of 
athlet ic bodies. 

' scanned t heedgeofthepool 
for an Amazonian butterfly 
star from Houston. As I looked 
behin d me I noticed a pixey, 
brown·hai red woman with 
friendly brown eyes. "Are you 
Lee?" Yes. 

We sat outside on the grass 
to enjoy t he kind of weat her we 
all came to an Diego for. 

This year t he UCSD 
women's team finished ni nth 
at the nationals in Boston. 
Morrow observed, "T wo vears 
ago UC D tied for last place in 
NCAA Division III. last year 
we placed 35th, this year we 
came in ninth and next year 
we'll do better." 

Morrow was a big reason for 
the team fi ni hing ninth with 

a sixth in the 400'yard 
individual medley, fifth in the 
lOO·yard butterfl y, ninth in 
the 500·yard freestyle, a tenth 
and 12th in the 400 and 200-
yard med ley relays, respec-
tively. In case that is not 
Impressive enough Morrow 
broke the 200-yard butterfly 
nationa l record bv about 4.5 
seconds wit h a ti n-ie of 2:09.40. 
Strangely enough, Division III 
times were faster t ha n 
Division II . which shows 
many good swimmers like 
Morrow are goi ng to t he school 
of their choice - not just 
where the scholarships are. 

Morrow began swimming at 
the age of seven. She competed 
In an AA program and later on 
her high school team. Morrow 
worked out three times a day 
in high school for a total of 
'even hour" a day. "1 just ate, 
slept, went to school and 

warn." Understandably, 
Morrow "burned out on 
wimming" at the end of high 

school. 
f'" peaked as a swimmer at 

the age of 13 or 14, because 
when a woman's body starts to 
change, she is as light as she 
will be and proportionally 

stronger. There are st ill some 
marks that I have not 
improved on since' was 14." 

Was n't that frustrating? 
"Sure it's frustrating, but 

women peak young. Nobody 
can tell you you 've peaked. 
You have to figure it out for 
yourself. Now school come' 
fi rst and I sWim becau<;e , 
enjoy it. 

" I used toswim20,OOOyards 
a day but now With so much 
school work I only sWim 8.000 
yards per day ." 

But Morrow stIli swims 
year·round. 

he is now trying out for a 
job as a state beach Itfeguard 
at San Clemente 

"The training IS tough. 
Every Sat urday we do w hat is 
called a 'vitamin.' That is a 
half-mile beach run followed 
by a I,OOO-yard ocean swim 
arou nd a buo;: and then 
another hal f-mlle run .. 

Morrow feels that S\\ 1m 
ming has helped her in man\ 
ways. 

"Anyone who competes 
competitIvely has to become 
much more organt7ed and use 
their time more effectl\el~ I

The damaged Der by 
By LARRY GOLDMAN 

Sta ll Writer 
aturday marks the 107th running of the Kentucky 

Derby. This year's race has been called the most dramatic 
Derby m history e\'en though tt has yet to be run. Why' 
Becau e the top cont enders of the race are not in it. 

First, Timely Writer, the pre-race favonte. was stncken 
with colic and underwent , urgery. He won't race for at 
least three months. Nex t, Linkage, after win ning the Blue 
Grass Stakes, was determi ned to be the race favorite. The 
only problem is that Linkage's grainer IS not running him 
in the Derby. Instead, he is saving him for the Preakne s 
Stake. 

Finally, Ho tage, winner of theArkansas Derby, another 
prominent contender, fractured his right leg several days 
ago. Thi . leaves the Derby up in the air and gives The 
Guardian experts a chance to show what they'\,e got.

Disabled students 
continued from page 10 
of participating successfully 
with the non·di abled, and 
that they must be protected 
from the pain and humiliation 
as ociated with unsucce ful 
attempt to compete," the 
brochure s tate. 

"They also believe that even 
adults with di abilities are not 
capable of under tanding their 
ow n need a nd making 
rational decisions ba. ed on 
t hat under tanding. 

"Thi same paternalistic 
and elf· erving philosoph y is 
al 0 u ed to ju tify egregating 
thousand of college tudents 
with disabilitie in 'pecial 
clas es ' where they are taught 

subject which non·di abled 
s tudents do not need to take." 

Knowle concluded special 
education cia ses are ju tified 
in elementary and secondary 
school , but not in college, 
where a ba ic understanding 
of material and the abilit y to 
learn are a umed. 

Gra ley from Evergreen 
College disagreed, aying even 
students with the ability to 
learn who have the knowledge 
required of college students 
sometime need pecial help. 

For example, orne disabled 
tudent would not be able to 

parllClpate in a so lar 
technology clas offered to all 
tudent without specia l 

educators who h&lp transmit 
the co urse material to 
students who cannot under· 
stand the teacher. 

A di s abled tudent 
coordinator at a Bay Area 
co mmunit y co llege who 
reque ted anonymit y said 
mains treaming deaf students 
into regular classe co ts three 
times as much as conduct ing 
pecial classes ince note· 

takers, interpret ers and ot her 
pecial services are required. 
Under the finance depart· 

ment's plan, the funds taken 
from actual educat ion could be 
used for the e special services. 
The $6 million would be taken 
specifically from the extra 
co ts, from educat ing disabled 
students off campus and from 
transporting student to and 
from chool. 

Thursday, April 29, 1982 

Finan ce departm ent 
representat ive Fred Klas ' 
sa id, college wi II be allowed to 
use only per· pupil funding for 
actual teaching. The disabled 
students fund , which roug hly 
a mount s to $19 million 
annually for all community 
colleges, would be off limits for 
regular or special educat ion

There are no immediate 
plans to implement thefinance

dations, which were explained 
at an Assembly Way and 
Means education s ubcommit·

More than 300 peop le

BArtK SHOTS,TRKX 
AND OTHaTABU 

I'm gonna teach you 
coupla thin~s that'll 1) 
press your fnends, and 2) 
lose some friends. 

All you need is good eyesight, 
a little dexterity, and three essen· 
tials : a pool table, pool cue, and 
some Lite Beer from Miller. 

CIEA'SIOTS 
Here's a goodie. I call it the 

"Cheap Shot:' Place a ball on the 
edge of the corner pocket. Then, 
take a half· dollar and lean it 
against the side rail at the other 
end of the table . (If you don't have 
a half-dollar, you can always write 
home to your parents: they'd love 
to hear from you.) 

Tell your friends you're gonna 
Sink the ball in the corner, using 
the half-dollar as a cue ball. It·s not 
hard. Hit the coin solidly on the 
edge, Just above the center, and it 
will roll along the rail knocking the 
ball In the pocket. But don't forget 

to scoff up the half-dollar. Be· 
cause you're not supposed to 
lose money doing trick 

shots-just win Lite Beers. 
_ca.DICK 

This one drives people nuts. Place 
a ball on the head spot. With the chalk, 
make a circle around it, approximately 
8" in diameter. Then put a quarter or 
half-dollar on top of the ball . (Yes. you 
can use the same one from before, or 
you can write home to your parents 
again .) Place the cue ball behind the 
foot line and have your friends try to 

un BEll FROM -' •• MIYTIM YOU AL.s MmD 
.A .... _LESS. 

by Steve Mizerak 
knock the coin out of the circle. 
Chances are, they won't be able 
to (this is a good time to work on 
your Lite Beer and act smug). 

When you shoot, do one of two 
things: hit the object ball head-on 
with follow-through so the cue ball 
knocks the coin out, or hit the cue 
ball very, very slowly so the coin 
rolls off the object ball. 

lUUM ... EIS 
Now for Simple table etiquette. 

After you've "hustled" your 
friends. you go"a keep 'em. So do 
what I call "Clearing the Table:' 
Simply offer to buy the next round 
of Lite Beer. They'll all clear the 
table fast and head for the bar (or 
to your room or apartment). Then, 
once they all have Lite (just one 
apiece- you're not too rich, re-
member), tell them with Lite in 
hand and a smirk on your face that 
your shots were no big deal- you 
were just showin' off.
