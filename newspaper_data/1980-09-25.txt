Silly Charlton 
resigns from AS 

President leaves today 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Associate News Editor 
AS President Jeremy 

Charlton did an undeniably 
silly thing at la t night's AS 
Council meeting . He 
resigned. 

"As most of you have 
already heard, I intend to 
resign tomorrow morning," 
Charlton said to council 
members last night. 

"Basically, an academic 
change I made last month has 
made it impossible for me to 
handle both the presidency 
and my c1asse . 

"I feel greater responsi-
bility to myself than to UCSD 
students," explained 
Charlton, indicating his 
belief that academics "should 
in all cases come before 
student government." 

Bill Topkis, elected vice 
president in last April's AS 
election, will assume the 
presidency as per AS by-laws. 
His council position will be 
filled by president pro tem 
Ernie Grijalva until an 
appointment is made and 
approved by the Council. 

Charlton, whose silly 
campaign propelled him to 
victory over Student Body 
Presidents' Council chair-
woman Linda Sabo spring 
quarter, cited "an unexpect-
ed change in majors' as 
responsible for his resigna-
tion.

New Editor 
Rely tampons, distributed 

to many women on campus 
last week in "Good Stuff" 
promotional packages, have 
been linked to the rising 
number of "toxic shock 
syndrome" cases sweeping 
across the country, according 
to government medical 
experts. 

"I've decided to graduate as 
a dual major, in economics 
and math, and must take 
some heavy-d uty math 
sequences this year unless I 
want to stay here a sixth 
year," he explained, adding 
that two major commitments 
was more than he could 
handle. 

"The AS tends to consume 
people. Past presidents have 
let their classes slide and I 
feel schooling and personal 
life must come first, " said 
Charlton. "I have only one 
objective now - my studies. 
And I'm really excited about 
academics now. Before, I 
wasn't excited about the AS 
o~ my classes." 

Although academic pres-
sures were primarily 
responsible for his resigna-
tion, Charlton admits other 
factors are attributable. 

"When I launched my silly 
campaign last spring, I didn't 
intend, or want, to win," he 
said. "By electing me, the 
students said they weren't 
happy with student govern-
ment, so I became president. 
It was a challenge, but I won't

chairman Donald Helinski, Kennedy was allowed to 
who is part of a department speak before the committee 

and register his chronology of 
events, and that Kennedy 
was not invited to the final 
meeting of the committee 
only because he did not 
request attendance. Helinski 
said his confidential report 
would now go to Atkinson. 

Kennedy offered the 
speculation (italics his) that a 
vial of semliki flown to him 
from England along with a 
shipment of sindbad was 
damaged and contaminated 
the sindbad virus. Semliki 
breeds faster , he wrote, and 
therefore would have almost 
completely taken over the 
colony of sindbad by the time 
he began his research.

Fountain will rise again 
BY RANDY HILL 

The students of UCSD 
witnessed a minor miracle 
last spring. After nearly a 
year of not working, the 
Revelle fountain magically 
started up the last week of 
classes, just in time to float a 
bevy of watermelons in its 
bowl during the annual 
watermelon festival. 

But students returned to 
classes this week only to find 
the fountain dry and the 
water nozzles gon . Has the 
Revelle fountain faded once 
again into oblivion? 

The answer, of coure, is no. 

Aocording to Roger Smith, 
grounds maintenan ~e 
superintendent, the fountam 
should be working by Friday. 
In a meeting yesterday with 
Associate Vice-Chancellor 
Donald Sites, Smith wa !old 
to "crank it up as soon as 
possible," he says. 

Smith explained that the 
fountain was hut down after 
finals spring quarter to 
prevent damage during the 
summer months. He was 
merely waiting for ago-ahead 
to tart up the fountain. Now 
that Sites has given . he green 
light, Smith ha told his men 

to work on the fountain at the 
first available opportunity. 

"Assuming everything is 
working, I can get it to work 
in one day," Smith says. he

I was piqued by Bruce 

Macdonald's chauvinistic 
tract on coffee drinking. I 
happen to be an American tea 
drinker. something that Mr. 
Macdonald apparently 
considers anachronistic to 
the point of being ludicrous. 

So how come, if tea is so u n-
American. all the famous 
coffee drinkers listed by Mr. 
Macdonald are Europeans? It 
is obvious that he contradicts 

himself more frequently than 
on the occasions when he 
adulterates his coffee.

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Crossing the Golden Gate 

Bridge one morning last 
summer, I sincerely believed 
th€-e was no place I'd rather 
be. 

San Francisco. typically 
f9UY and teemin~ ~ith 
tounsts. was my destmatlon. 
The day of shopping and 
strolling the city streets I'd 
ptanned seemed flawlessly 
appealing. 

Yet something went 
wrong. My visions of the day 
were soon to be marred. 

After lunching with my 
father in the pleasant garden 
environment of MacArthur 
Park restaurant. I headed on 
foot towards Union SQuare. 
where Macy's White Flower 
Day Sale awaited me. Intent 
on absorbing all that the city 
offers - inhabitants of every 
race. faith and nationality. 
colorful street performers. 
remnants of a turbulent past,

a man. of sleazy appearance. 
was following me. 

Perhaps it was upon 
reaching Kearny Street that I 
discovered my unwanted 
companion; perhaps I'd 
reached Grant. No matter. 
My detection of him 

immediately provided me 
with a feeling of uneasiness 

unlik~ anything I'd ever 
expenenced. 

'It's not possible.' I assured 
myself, crossing the street 

and backtracking towards a 
different route to the 
department store. 

A quick glance over my 
right shoulder indicated that 
my fears were justified; I was 
being tailed. 

Quickening my pace for 
some thoroughly reflexive 
reason, I tried to rationally 
examine my situation. Rage 
and indignation . could not 
penetrate the fear that kept 
me from confronting my 
follower. A lack of SFPD 
officers in the area made 
seeking help from 'the law' a 
useless alternative. Sharing 
my fears with a camera-laden 
tourist from Indiana seemed 
a pointless waste of time. 

I continued on, uneasiness 
mounting. 

There is a better place for 

'a follower' to torment a 
victim than a city like San 
Francisco. Crowds of city 
dwellers and excited visitors, 
congested streets. endless 
shops. large buildings, parks 
and numerous alleys provide 
outstanding opportunities 
for concealment.

Senate oks sale of 
uraniuDl to India 

WASHINGTON - In a 
fore~ policy victory for 
PreSident Carter.' the Senate 
voted 48-46 yesterday to 
permit shipment of 38 tons of 
enriched uranium to India, 
which diverted· US . nuclear 
material in 1974 and used it 
to detonate an atomic bomb. 

The vote came after one of 
the most thorough and 
contes~ed Senate debates in 
years.' It was marked by 
personal and extensive 
telephone lobbying by 
refused to go along with the 
salw. 

A vote against the sale by 
. both houses was required to 
stop the transaction. 

The Senate roll call found 
both parties sharply divided 
on the issue. Twenty-four 
Democrats and 22 Republi-
cans voted in favor of 
blocking the sale. Thirty-two 
Democrats and 16 Republi-

for Info 

cans voted to allow the-sale. 
Leaders of the drive to 

block the sales said that 
permitting them would 
"eviscerate" US efforts 
world wide to stop the spread 
of nuclear weapons because 
India has refused to agree to 
safeguards aimed at blocking 
diversion of the fuel to 
weapons use. 

But backers of the sale 
argued that blocking the 
transaction would undercut 
Carter's attempts to 
persuade India to accept 
international safeguards for 
its nuclear program and 
would alienate the Indian 
people at a time of warfare 
and political and religious 
unrest in Southwest Asia . 

India wants the low-
enriched uranium to 
resupply the reactor .

Curb gets 
no bills 

SACRAMENTO - Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr.'s staff 
yesterday apparently 
thwarted an attempt by Lt. 
Gov. Mike Curb, the acting 
governor, to veto a bill that 
would make it harder for 
prosecu.tors to defeat judges 
In elections. 

A spokesman for Curb, 
Roger Gamst . said the 
Republican lieutenant 
governor is "very upset" that 
Brown's office did not comply 
with a request to deliver two 
bills to Curb Tuesday for his 
signature or veto. 

Curb has full authority as 
governor. including the 
power to sign or veto bills. 
while Brown is out of the 
state. The governor returned 
yesterday afternoon. 

The Democratic ~overnor 
has taken no position on 

either that bill or the Bannai 
bill. which would increase 
prison sentences for robbers 
who use a knife or certain 
other weapons to make 
threats or inflict minor 
injuries. Brown has until 
Sept. 30 to act.

after the federal government

to cases of toxic·s hock

Council 'rejects' nlove _ 
to ~,e~tructure Reg 'Fee 

BY DEAN J. HAAS 
The AS Council, amid confusion 

over the surprise resignation of 
President Jeremy Charlton, voted 
unanimously last night to reject the 
restructuring of the Reg Fee 
Committee as proposed by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard 
Armit . 

The Ts, of course, does not have the 
authority to force Armitage to change 
his decision. 

The resolution, proposed by Student 
Welfare Commissioner Re·ggie 
Williams, accused Armitage of making 
the proposal during the summer 
without student consultation. He also 
claimed it would impede student 
ability to allocate Reg Fee money 
according to student needs and 
priorities. 

In addition to the resolution, the 
Council demanded a meeting with 
Armitage to discuss the restructuring. 

Armitage plans to reduce the 
number of members on the committee 
but strengthen the student to faculty 
ratio in the student's favor. Armitage, 
however, is to take control of the 
appointment of the committee's ten 
student members. 

Williams believes the colleges will 
no lon~r be an important factor on the 
commIttee and that "this process will 
go on until his (Vice Chancellor 

Armit~) bureaucratic tendencies are 
served. 

Debbe Kelley, AS Commissioner of 
Appointments and Evaluations, 
argued that under the new committee 
structure Armitage would be able to 
control the entire 1981 Reg Fee budget. 
Kelley also said she had recently 
learned that the chairperson of the 
revamped committee would not be a 
student. 

AS Vice President Bill Topkis (who 
replaces Charlton as president today) 
told the Council , "It is our 
responsibility as the voice of the 
s tudents to let them (the 

administration) know what's wrong 
with the Reg Fee proposal." 

Following discussion of Armitage's 
proposal, the Countil voted to support 
a statement of endorsement prepared 
by the San Diego Committee to Defend 
NASSCO Workers. The endorsement , 
submitted by AS Muir representative 
Jon Bekken, accuses NASSCO of 
attempting to bust the workers unions 
at the San Diego shipbuilding plant. 
The Committee also charges that 
NASSCO collaborated with the FBI 
and San Diego Police to "frame union 
activists." 

The statement also urged 
indictment of NASSCO for criminal 
negligence the Committee says 
resulted in the "murders" of two 
workers at the plant earlier this 
month. The men, Michael Beebe and 
Kenneth King, died due to a lack of 
ventilation in the area in which they 
were working. 

Bekken saw the action as "an 
expression of widespread support for 
the NASSCO workers' fight for better 
working conditions." 

He did not express surprise, 
however, over the Council's 
endorsement of the statement. 

"I did not expect it to pass but I am 
happy to see that this AS Council has 
itself together," he said. 

Ernie Grijalva, Academic Affairs 
Commissioner voiced support of the 
workers ' postion but strongly opposed 
the Council's labeling of the plant 
deaths as "murders." 

"It is not our duty as the AS Council 
to accuse anyone of murder," Grijalva 
commented. 

Toby Raymond, Muir College 
representative, echoed Grijalva 's 
position. 

"Accusing someone of murder is too 
heavy a job for an AS Council."

stream of big green apples 
began dropping heavily to the 
floor . One of the grey suits 
and a striped apron moved in 
swiftly and restored the stray 
fruit, watched by the first 
customers sampli ng the 
treats of the International 
Appetite Shoppe over in the 
corner. 

Enjoying the novelty of it 
all, I dragged myself away to 
the checkouts and paid for 
my snapper and cheddar. 
Ralph himself was putting in 
an appearance , ba~gi ng

suggestion to come again. 

Clutching my bag of food

my violet in the other. I 
decided to enter the 
sweepstake some other time, 
and committed my empty 
cart to a herd of some dozen 
others that a man in a red 
waistcoat had rounded up 
and was driving toward open 
doors . Outside, a man 
strolled up to the Pepsi stand 
with the can towering over it 
like a grain silo. A smile came 
to his face. "What kind of 
drinks do you serve here?" he 
enquired.

from my temporary lapse of 
rationality. I hailed a yellow 
cab and urged the driver to 
speed toward a distant bus 
stop and welcome escape. 

Driving painfully slkow 
from where I'd last spotted 
my follower, I nearly 
succeeded in looking straight 
ahead, not behind me where I 
knew he stood. But acute 
curiosity now mingled with 
my fear; I had to look back. 

Peering through the taxi's 
back window. I scan:ened the 
crowd for a moment before 
spotting 'the follower.' Once 
my gaze found him glaring at 
me from the street corner, 
there was no escaping the 
haunting feeling this 
stranger instilled in me. 

'What was this man's 
motivation? Why me? Will it 
happen again?' 

These Questions disturb 
me still, weeks after the 
incident.

with divine beauty. In ORe

me to take the weapon, he 
softly said, "Do it for lC.,

Charlton resigns AS 
continued from palte 1 
bundle of fun ." 

Sabo, formerly AS 
commissioner of external 
affairs and Charlton's 
opponent last pring. believes 
hi resignation is a result of 
several factors . 

"I know academics and 
personal life have high 
priority in Jeremy's life," she 
said. "But I also think hejust 
doesn't enjoy the job very 
much. which is very 
understandable. He's had an 
additional problem fuUiJling 
the silly spirit of his 
campaign while doing the 
necessary serious things a 
president has to do." 

Sabo also believes, along 
with several other AS 
officials, that Charlton's 
opinion of theAS and student 
government has changed 
drastically since his 
campaign last spring. 

"Jeremy ran for fun, as a 

joke. Once he became more 
knowledgeable about the AS 
and what it does, he realized 
it wasn't as absurd a he 
thought," said Sabo. "I 

truly respect him for 
resigning and admitting he 
was unhappy. If he'd decided 
to stick around and do a half· 
ass job, he would have hurt 

himself and people working 
with him." 

Jon Bekken , Student 
Center Board member and 
former AS commissioner , 
believe Charlton's resigna· 
tion, which joins three other 
recent resignations by silly 
slate council member , is 
typical of the silly students. 

"All of the silly council 
mem bers elected except one 
(Activity Fee Commiss ioner 
Todd Thompson ) have 
resigned. Thi fact reinforces 
my opinion that the silly 
students didn't know what 
they were getting into when 
they ran for office," said ' 
Bekken. 

Most council members 
voiced disappointment when 
they heard of Charlton's 
resignation, although they 
seem confident that Topkis 
will be a competent 
president.

Kennedy attacks IBC 
continued from pale 1 
which Kennedy was working 
was a P3 lab, one level more 
secure than P2). 

However, Kennedy relates, 
there is no copy of the letter to 
the Finnish professor, Dr. 
Levi Kaariainen. 

Kennedy then wrote 
Barber and asked for 
confirmation, which he says 
he received. 

Kennedy said yesterdar. 
there is still a "technical' 
violation involved because all 
cloning work must be 
approved by the National 
Institutes of Health. 

Kennedy admits the 
accuracy of the mc report 
thilt he did use semliki virus 
in the lab, but contends that 
it was used intentionally in 
only non·Clonmg expenment. 
He concludes caustically, 
"Once again, if !BC had 
discussed this matter with 
me, it could readily have been 
c\ar!ried. However they did 
not. 

Kennedy also disputes the 
validity of the chronology 
that appeared under his 
name in the !BC report. 

"Dr. Gill and Dr. Abelson 

wrote this document. I did 
not. Since I presumed that I 
would be afforded an 
opportunity to discuss and 
expand on this document at a 
later time in front of the 
entire mC,1 merely corrected 
a few typographical errors in 
the document and handed it 
back to Dr. Gill. I was not 
afforded an opportunity at 
any future time to discuss or 
expand on this chronology ." 

Kennedy attacks other 
parts of the mc report 
several times during his 12 
page, single'spaced response. 

First, he writes off as "ill 
founded" an IBC contention 
that an early test should have 
yielded an indication that he 
was working with the wrong 
virus. 

"Clearly these fingerprints 
(identification marks) are 
very similar," Kennedy 
asserts. " Indeed this close 
similarity concerned !BC and 
they concluded that this 
similarity was too dose and 
rejected my assertion (pr. 
Abelson) cat~rically stated 
that such SImilarity from 
experiment to experiment 
would not exist."

Kennedy then cites everal 
differences in the two 
fingerprints. 

Kennedy also finds fault 
with an IBC contention that 
'sindbis' is not mentioned in ' 
in the first part of (a note 
lxlok of the experiment)." 

He responds: "This is 
simply because this experi· 
another notebook)." 

The implication of the 
report was that if sindbus 
was not mentioned, it might 
have been because semliki 
was involved. 

Kennedy also says that the 
mc did not deal properly 
with his notebooks. He says 
that the committee only 
looked at his completed 
notebook. one "intended for 
publication," and that they 
did not look at other 
notelxloks indicating that he 
was working closely with 
sindbus. 

He adds, however, that 
"mc had difficulty accepting 
this compilation, partly 
because it is a compilation 
and partly because no 
independent confirming 
evidence exists in the form of 
a record in the Muir P3 lab."

No nuclear license to UCLA? 
Crowded campus, reactor don't mix, committee says 

LOS ANGELES -
UCLA's application to renew 
its fecIeral license for a small 
nuclear reactor is being 
challenged by an environ-
mental group that contends 
the 20-year-old research 
reactor IS a threat to the 
crowded campus. 

Three US Atomic Safety 
and Licensing Board 
investiptora from Washing-
ton, DC are meeting here 
today to determine whether a 
relicensing hearing should be 
held to consider alleptions 
by the UCLA-baed Commit-
tee to Bridge the Gap. 

The pre}jearing conference 

will decide which, if any, of 
the allegations warrant a 
formal hearing. It will not 
ronsider the accuracy of the 
charJle5. 

"This reactor has far less 
radioactivity than a big 
commercial nuclear power 
plant," said Bridge the Gap 
spokesman Dan Hirsch, "but 
because it is sited in a 
crowded classroom buildi~ 
and is on a crowded campus 
in a highly populated area of 
the city, we believe as many 
people could be injured by an 
accident here" as at a larger 
facility in a less populous 
area. 

"We contend the benefits 
of this reactor are virtually 
nonexistent and the risks are 
major," he said. "Our desire 
is that the reactor as it 
presently exists be denied 
licensing. " 

Neill Ostrander, manager 
of UCLA's Nuclear Engineer-
ing Laboratory which 
operates the reactor, said he 
considered the facility safe 
"without qualification_" 

"We can't conceive of any 
accident, short of deliberate 
sabotage, that would cause a 
core meltdown or any 
startling release of radioact-
ivity to the atmosphere," he 

said. 
He said the reactor, which 

was rompleted in 1960 and 
relicensed in 1971 , is 
designed in such a way that 
the nuclear fuel in its core 
could not melt even if all 
rooling water were lost In 
fact, he said, the cooling 
water would be dumped in an 
emergency shutdown. 

The reactor's maximum 
output is about one-half of 
one megawatt of heat energy, 
compared to some 3,000 
megawatts in a typical 
modem nuclear power plant. 
The UCLA facility does not 
produce electricity. 

Friends wish you luck 
OR a bigex81D• GOoa Mends stick 

arOund to see how you did. 

They say they were just 
hangjng around killing time and 
by the way, MHow did yru do?" 
You teD them a celebration is in 
order and that you're buying the 
beer. MLook," one 0{ them says, 
MU yoo did that weD, buy us 
something speciaI." Toright, let 
it be LOwenbriiu. 

Ostrander said the eight-
sided reactor consists of a 
core about five feet across 
surrounded on all sides by a 
five-foot- thick concrete-and-
lead shield. It originally was 
in an isolated buildin, he said, 
"but. since that time 
buildings have grown up 
around us_" 

He said the reactor is used 
primarily as a teaching tool 
for nuclear engineering 
students and for research by 
other departments_ 

Hirsch repeated allega-
tions that radioactive argon 
gas released through an 
exhaust stack passes over 
rooftops used by students 
and drifts into the Math 
Science Building's ventila-
tion system. 

He also criticized the lack 
of a containment structure 
that would keep radiation 
from reaching the atmo-
sphere in event of an 
accident. Even if those and 

I other engineering complaints 
are resolved, he said, "they 
still need completely new 
management." 

Hirsch said Michael 
Douglas, a star of the movie 
"The China Syndrome," was 
invited in wtiting to visit 
"and even operate" the 
reactor, apparently to prove 
the safety of nuclear energy. 

Ostrander said the 
invitation was made by a 
laboratory staff member and 
"the management did not 
endorse that invitation and 
didn't even learn about it 
until after the facL" 

He said the invitation 
would not have been honored. 

Charlton 
Resigns 
continued from page 10 

''I'm really sad to see 
Jeremy go," said one council 
member. "it's been fun with 
him around; his silly attitude 
around the office has been 
good for council morale." 

AS Advisor Randy Wood-
ard agrees that Charlton's 
silliness had a positive effect 
on the AS. 

"Jeremy brought some real 
humanity to the council, 
which was really refreshing. 
He just isn't the type that 
survives in !!tudent govern-
ment, thoup. He doesn't 
have the politiro mentality, 
which is good," said 
Woodard. 

Bill Topkis, who officially 
takes over as president today, 
is "ready to get at it_ .. 

"I considered running last 
spring, but felt I could better 
serve the council as vice 
president, helpinJ the 
president," said Topkis. 

"But I'm enthusiastic and 
plan to put my energy 
towards fillinl{ council 
vacancies (election, com-
munication and pu blic 
relations commissioner 
positions are open) first." 

Will Topkis follow 
Charlton's silly approach to 
student government? 

''I'm not a silly individual. I 
don't want to wear a 
bathrobe and I don't think 
commissionerships should be 
raffled off on the Plaza," said 

T~kis. 
, But I do think milk and 

·cookies at council meetings is 
a good idea."
