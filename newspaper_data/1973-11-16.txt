Election Epilog: Why The Polls Were Off-Cal11pus 
Stud nt apathy and a lack of com-

munication betw en the R gistrar of Voters 
Office and the University ar to blame for 
the lack of on- ampu polls in the 
Novemb r 6 ele tion . 

According to the Assistant Registrar of 
Voters, Mr. D nny, lack of student interest 
in local elections, "problems getting polling 
places on-campus", and an unfortunate 
mixup in the recru itment of tudent 
volunteers to man th polls forced the 
Registrar of Voters to sh ift polling places for 
U.C.S .D. student voters to off-campus 
10 ations . Speaking for the Registrar of 
Voters, he insisted, "We want to see a high 
voter turnout; we-would love to have polls 
on campus." 

H categorically denied charges that 
there had been any politi ca l motivation 
behind th shift in polling lo cations, or any 
attempt to lower the voter tumout on the 
part of his office. 

Concerned U.C.S.D . students had made 
such charges following in itially confusing 
and contradictory statements from the 
Registrar of Voters Office concerning the 
shift . 

Denny berated students for their general 
apathy concerning elections, particuliarly 
local elections. He noted that in last June's 

(posted in Augu t) a kin g for students to 
help run th polls w r een only by umm r 
stud nts, who live off-campu and ar 
ineligibl to work in on-campus polls. The 
law r quires that work rs at a poll live in 
that poll'~ precin t , so student volunteers 
must b r gistered (on-campus) voters. 
B ause the law also require that the cycle 
of setting up polls begin 90 day before the 
election, they must be signed up to work 
three months prior to election day. 

What is needed, then, is a guaranteed 
polling location on-campus, and a list of 
tudents willing to work at the polls. The 

responsibility now rests on the students and 
on the University . 

Initially, many students saw the shift to 
off-campus polls as the resu It of manuvering 
by the Registrar of Voters of Voters Office to 
lower the student voting turnout, and as an 
infringement upon their legal rights . 
Confusing and contradictory statements 
from various bureaucrats, meant to clarify 
their position, managed only to distort and 
confuse it even more . 

Apparently, however, the confusion 
resulted from a lack of communication, 
both within the Registrar of Voters Office 
and between that office and the University, 
not from any attempts at deception.

All Time High 
at UC 

Enrollment at the Un iversity of California has reached 
118,909 students according to final Fall registration 
figures released today (Oct. 25) . The University-wide 
total represents an increase of 5,646 students over last 
year's enrollment of 113,263. 

The 118,909 student enrollment on the nine UC 
campuses exceeds the University' s anticipated 
enrollment of 115,972 by 2,937 students, of which 1,700 
are new undergraduates. According to University-wide 
Director of Admissions Lyle Cainsley, the increase of 
new undergraduates over the number exoected reflects 
the University's efforts to maximize the accommodation 
of new students at their campus of first choice. 

Presenting the 
Back Ache 

"Oh, My Aching Back" is the narne of a one-day 
program to be presented by UCSD Extension Saturday, 
Nov. 24. I n the course of a few hours any interested 
person can learn how physicians, psychologists and 
acupuncturists view origins and treatments of a variety 
of back troubles. 

Dr. F. Bruce Kimball , a UCSD School of Medicine 
associate clinical professor of surgery/orthopedics, will 
lead the short course, which meets from 9 a.m . to 3 :30 
p.m . in Room 2100 of the Basic Science Building at the 
medical school. 

He says the primary focus will be on the kind of 
backache a person has had for a long time, usually in 
the lower back region . 

Registration fee for the Extension program is $11 per 
person. For enrollment in formation, please telephone 
453-2000 extension 2061 .

'They Like 
Mint Juleps' 

It was out of Our 
Responsibility to Inform 
that the Triton Times went 
to the people last Wed-
nesday with one of the 
great questions of the 
decade: Why do flying 
saucers only go to the 
South? 

Indeed: 
The one confirmed, 

substantiated contact with 
real flying saucer guys was 
in Mississippi. 

Thirty-seven thousand 
people saw a blueish-green 
thing over a football 
stadium in Kentucky. 

And what about the La 
Jolla sightings? La Jolla is a 
respectable, wea It hy 
community. These people 
could not all be bonkers . 

Therefore , sensing an 
issue over which there 
would be great emotional 
outpourings, through which 
people could di~cuss all that 
mystified and terrified 
them, we contacted a large 
number of UCSD students, 
completely at random , and 
put to them The Questio n. 

And please do not te II us 
this is not an important 
issue. Do not tell us people 
don't care, or don't believe. 
Because in fact, one Revelle 
student was so terrified, so 
threatened even at the 
mention of flying saucers, 
that he hung up on our 
questioner as soon as he 
heard The Question. (Come 
in to the Triton Times 
office, poor soul. Lie 
you rself down on our lu mpy 
blue couch. We' ll help 
you .) 

Of course, the political 
implications of The 
Question are awesome . 
Why this blatant 
discrimination against The 
North? (It's true-When was 
the last time you heard 
about a UFO in Bangor, 
Maine? Or even Nome, 
Alaska? Huh? They just 
don't go to those places.) 
Or is it that they plan to 
take over the South, and kill 
all the people from there? 
Horrible thoughts, - these . 

So, the resu Its of the first 
Triton Times survey . 

.... 

Several people im-
mediately concluded that 
the answer to The Question 
was political in nature. A 
Reve lle student, who 
r e lu c tantly identified 
herself as Debbie, tied the 
flying saucers to the 
decaying Presi dency . 
"Nixon sent 'em, " she said . 
"The flying sau ers have a 
secret pact with him .-

But how can you know 
that for sure? we asked . 

By John Taylor 

"There're a lot of things 
we aren't sure of about 
Richard Nixon." 

Another girl felt they 
went south "to get as far 
away from Nixon as they 
can ." They must not know 
about Key Biscayne, then . 
Maybe the Washington Post 
doesn't deliver that far out. 
With the paper shortage 
and all . 

An Muir person said the 
flying saucers were either 
from another galaxy or the 
John Birch Society. The 
logic here, he felt, was 
inescapable. He added, " I 
never read your crummy 
paper." 

Or is it just pia in 
discrimination? Th is 
conversation, with a subject 
obviously in the pro per 
con dition to answer a 
question like The Question, 
leads us to believe so : 

"They like to pick on 
Californians." 

Californians? 
"And Oakies ." 
What's wrong with' 

Oakies? 
"They're pickers." 
Cotton pickers? 
" No ." Although this 

person quickly identified 
herself, we will allow her 
her privacy. 

The second mos 
common kind of answer 
Ciime from the scientific 
types. Kathy Hubert said 
flying saucers like swamp 
a ir. Karen Hackett com-
mented: 

"They go to the South 
because birds fly south ." 

Does that mean fly in g 
saucers are birds? 

"No. It means they're like 
birds." Birdlike qualities, 
then, are universal. 

Three subjects told us, 
"They go south because 
gr;lvity pulls them there :" 
Bill (he would n't tell us th e 
rest) said that flying saucer-
creatures, who are used to 
the cold, noxou s a t-
mosphere of 
Venus,naturally choose the 
warm South. Thanks, Bill . 

And of course, there was 
the obvious explanation of 
the iron deposits and 
magnetic fields they have in 
the South . 

Then, the Spiritualists : 
"The people in the south 

are receptive to those sorts 
of vibrations from other 
planets ." 

" It seems strange to me, 
too." 

The Humanists : 
"T hey don't like people ." 
The Degenerates : 
"T hat's where the action

Book Review 

Voss 
by Joan Carwood 

Through television it is possible to discover the 
coerc ive professor who exorts the peasants to come up 
and buy his wonder work in g pills and elixers. Whatever 
their disease, he has a name and a cure; and if one 
hangs back in disbelief he produces a few human 
testimonies and speaks so well and quickly that soon 
even the doubters rush forward to purchase the magic 
potion . 

Literary criticism in all its omniscent glory often 
appears to complement these gabbling boluses . Still , 
there have been occasions when I myself passed the 
jaundiced eye to the other sisters and pressed to receive 
with the rest, the virtu es of everlasting health (or 
knowledge). This time in itial expectations were paltry 
compared to the actual excellence of the medicine. 
Patrick White's Voss is a superb novel, so superb in fact, 
that I feel it my duty to in crease the world's aware ness 
of this ma~nificent product of human genius. 

The setting (yes, '1 must begin with the settin g) is 
. Australia, 1845. We Americans enchanted with our own 

growth and expansion, are unaware that the peoples of 
another continent experienced the same desire to study 
and map the unknown, to uncover strange and beautiful 
scenes, and to pave the way for future settlement at 
approximately the same moment in history. Australia 
was ignored because it did not threaten us in our quest 
to join hands with our manifest destiny, that charter br 
greatness. Nor was Australia pitiful. We could not nurse 
it I ike Cu ba. 

Fortunately explorers themselves seldom reflect the 
interests of the state of society and certainly the dangers 
for both Aussie and American were equivalent; 
Aborigone for Indian, desert for snowfall . One wonders 
though, if in all history there was ever such a man, an 
explorer, as Johann Ulrich Voss . He is awful. It is correct 
for civilized society to hate him , for this one is the self-
will incarnate. He has no use for us of our pantheon of 
gods. His existence destroys the meaning of " human 
bonds" and "friendship". Voss lives for Voss alone. 
"What does not kill me will make me strong,", says 
Nietzche, but it is Voss who speaks now; Voss, who 
becomes so strong through self-denial that he must die 
for us to survive and to preserve that balance in nature 
which we so admire. 

And Voss does die, violently. We are made to suspect 
as we read the passages describing his agony that th e 
fault is ours, that we are the savages who slice his veins 
to examine the texture of hisblood and who finally 
"stab and saw and cut and break his body" with the only 
possession that is usefu I to us, a present from the 
practical Voss,a knife . We find ourselves viewing Voss's 
decapitated head "again st a few stones, like any melon" 
and hiss, delighted with the blood absorbed im - , 
mediately by dry earth . Or so we imagine. 

But if we merely "rot by living" then we are excluded 
from a salvation attained only through the grace of 
death and the humbleness of profane misery. This Voss 
knows. So like a Creek tragedy, the significance of 
falling itself increases with the stature and importance 
of the hero. 

It is now we can moan for the great Voss, who "at last 
was truely humbled" .. . who is "a man bound by the 
threads of his fate . A whole knot of it" . When he 
screa ms "Oh Jesus, ratte mich nur! Du lieber! " it is a 
worthy exp,ession, for all suffering and all salvation . 
And somew~ere in the sky a voice whispers "Ah Lord . 
Let him bear it" . ' 

The moment Voss dies a girl awakes from a thick 
fever and murmers "Oh Cod . It is over. It is over." S he is 
Laura Trevelyan , our lady of the novel. She too is an 
explorer, who believes "most palpably, in wood, with 
the reflections in it, and in clear daylight, and in wa ter" . 
As a child "she wou Id work frantically at some 
mathematical problem, just for the excitement of it to 
s0ive and know" . ' 

Laura is beautiful, but not. There is less beauty in 
mature intelligence than in the impish child, society 
warns us, and White's passages comparing Laura to 
delicious Belle Bonner (her cousin) are delightfu I. 
Superior. However, if the intensity of Voss is too dif-
ficult to understand, then there is also Miss Trevelyan to 
observe and fear . We fluctuate with the upper echelons 
of Australian society (noveau riche) upon deciding if 
indeed it would not be better to finish her off as the 
savage~ have clone with the explorer Voss . 

Only tea tab les and lozengers and womanhood saves 
her. It is I ss nice to torture females (although hardly 
beyond th r aim of human achi vernent) and as long 
as she does not manifest her " suffocation by the fuzz of 
faith " which later evolves into heightened spirituality 
(although not as great as that of Voss) th n people only 
hate her and admire her for an abil ity to look well in 
brown dresses. We are not quite compelled to send her

because it takes about a 
week for a new driver to be 
able to stick to a bus 
chedu le . 

There are currently eight 
student drivers being paid 
$ 3.33 an hour. Each driver 
must obtain a Class II 
driver's lisence and must go 
through a special heakh 
examination. 

The bus's managers 
wanted to hire work - study 
students to cut the cost of 
runni ng the bus since the 
federal government pays 
half their salary . However, 
work study referrals came 
tothe managers too far into 
the quarter . 

The bus is currently bein g 
supported by monies from 
the Student Activities Fee, 
advertising and by fares . 
Some of the advertising has 
been cancelled by the 
businesses involved 
because of the bus's 
unreliability and the fact 
that their advertisements 
were not hung up in the 
bus. Elaine says that the 
advertisements were not 
hu ng up because they keep 
changing buses . 

The only other possib Ie 
source of revenue for the 
bus is Chancellor McU-oy's 
discretio nary funds . 
Students are urged by the 
Students Activity Fee 
Commitee to petition the 
Chancellor to use these 
fu nds for this purpose. 

The following schedule 
cha nges will be effective as 
on Monday November 19. 

ROUTE HANCES: 
1. On ly the 10 p .m . run 
have the optio n of 
detouring to the freeway in 
order to let off passengers 
on Carmel Valley Rd. The 8-
9 a.m. and 9-10 a.m . runs 
will no longer do so (they 
will remain on 101) because 
of a safety factor with 
heavier loads. 
2. All runs going into 
Leucadia will go north on 
Vulcan and south on 101 
(We hope this will cut down 
on time and confusion) . 
T his changes the route of 
the evening runs , 
3. The bus derour into 
CardiH (across from VC 
donu t shop) in the mor-
nings will be eliminated . 
Instead, passengers wishing 
to embark in Cardiff must 
wait at th lights on 101 and 
Chesterfield . (We expect 
that this will cut about 5 
minutes off the schedu Ie so 
no one will have to wake up 
any earlier.) 
4 . Only the 9-10 a.m . run 
(which returns to Third 
College) will go by Salk 
southbound in the morning. 
The 7~ a.m . & 8-9 a.m . runs 
will go in by the temporary 
parkin lot between Mui" & 
Third Colleges. 
5 . There will be no detour 
on the 9-10 a.m. run to 
Summit Ave. in Cardiff . It 
will remain on San Elijo-
Vulcan . 
6 . The 3:30 p.m., 5 p.m ., & 
10 p.m. runs will pick up 
passengers by the 
Bookstore on Myers Ave 
(These runs will all go down 
Myers Ave).

th facts, and not the other 
way around. In digging so 
hard and inaccurately to 
find facts to prove his 
conclusions, Mr. Horowitz 
only succeeds in defeating 
his own purpose. He has 
removed the brunt of his 
attack' away from the real 
source of his fears, the 
political demand of pure 
tolerance by Nixon, Chile, 
and I T.T . thugs, and 
d isplaces it onto 
misrepresented I iterature. If 
we are to solve problems we 
must approach them 
directly , carefully, 
roÂ·tionally, and with swift 
social force, otherwise one 
will only change and shift 
the problems around, but 
never really solve them . 

A new community proiect may be starting 
up , -his new year-Horsemanship for the 
Handicapped- to be ru n out of the La Jolla 
Farms Stables. This program is directed 
towards hand icapped children, specifically 
those affected by Cerebra I Palsy. 

I n the greater San Diego area there are 
4400 people affected by cerebral palsy, 
according to an estimate made in 1972. Of 
these, a very large sector are children still in 
their " formative years ." 

The goal of the program is to teach 
handicapped children tq ride, in the process 
building muscle strength, tone and general 
coordination. The secondary eHects-the 
pride and sense of accomplishment that 
anyone feels after learning something 
new- are just an added bonus from the 
program.

Announcing 

This is not a Cothic novel, a romance, or a narra tion 
of the "first weat-then humble-then great" syndrome. It 
is a novel about a land, the last frontier, perhaps, where 
man can once again find himself absorbed into the 
harshness of his environment and not mourn his own 
passing, but to take glory in it .. It is a land, so new and 

fantastic, White seems to say, that is worthy of another 
Christ; it is worthy of the Vosses and the Lauras. and 
when Laura says " Voss d (j not d ie. He is still, it is said , 
in the country and always will be. His legend will be 
wr itten down, eventually, by those who have been 
troubled by it" we know that two crucifixions, or twice 
crucified, is more, much more, than any of us deserve.

Mass Impeachment 
Petition Drive 

A massive national impeachment campaign against 
Richard Nixon is being conducted by the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) . 

On Sat. Nov. 12 the ACLU initiated the creation of a 
broad-based coalition of groups and individuals 
favoring impeachment. Specifically, Impeachment 
Centers are being et up in each Congressional District 
of Southern California . The AClU ha~ placed full-page 
ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times, 
doc.umenting the reasons for impeachment. A copy of 
this ad was, published in the Triton Times on Friday, 
Nov. 2. The ACLU impeachment petition represents a 
forceful tool for bringing massive public pressure to 
bear upon Congress to initiate the impeachment 
process . 

~opies of all signatures to the petition will be sent to 
every member of the United States House of 
RepresentatIves . 

Impeachment petitions may be signed and copies 
obtained and returned at the following locations :

Congratulations To Democracy 
by Doug 8lagdon 

Congratulations to the Triton Times. You beat 
Proposition 1. 

Of course that doesn't mean that you did it Single 
handed. You were a part of a statewide movement to 
make democracy work. The Governor picked his issue 
and picked a time when opponents were less likely to 
vote than supporters. He had an enormous bankroll and 
a well organized selective campaign . He had all this and 
you beat him. 

Congratulations are in order to organizations like ti .e 
Student lobby, the Waldie for Governor campaign, and 
the League of Women Voters who contributed 
organized efforts. Congratulations to individuals like 
Assemblyman Willie Brown, students Chris Rauber, 
Gary Cannon, Chris Klump, Denise Morin , and Janice 
Crooks, and Regent Bill Roth all of whom worked here 
at UCSD. 

Congratulations to Ronald Reagan . In a fit of ilnusual 
car dor he admitted that even he couldn 't understand 
Prcp.,sition 1. This underlined his position as an actor 
mcu thing the lines fed to him by the rich people who 
bankroll him . It could well have decided the election . 

Congratulations to Speaker of the Assembly Bob 
M(,retti who wa s the chief spok sman of the opposition . 
It 'IIa n to rt nf Dolitical courage to 5 em to oppose 
101/ 'er taxes whil ~unning for Governu, . It se ms almost 
lik'"! opposing mother of appl pie. H has promised a 

ref ~rendum for real tax reform which is a sp l ndid idea . 
Â·Â·h biggest congratulations go to the people of 

Ca :ifornia and th whole democratic sy t m . The recent 
results of r fernda have kept faith with our Idea ls. Even 
thE' marijuana and d ath penalty issu 5 reflect what 
might be a misguided b lief in old fashion d justice . 

It is good to s e that the hard work and acrifice of 
many individuals can overcome th thirty e and pots 
of paid actors. After the disappointments of the 
McGovern campaign, this victory should restore our 
hope that we can make the whol thing work . 

Congratulations to all of us.

suc h comical represen- belief in America, belief in

Horowitz hides his lack of Wherever it is, though, that 
argument and substance by this bitter inner struggle 
belittling his opponents and ends, it is clear from the 
trying to make them as majority of society that in 
obviously ridiculous as most cases rational is not

listens to the obviously Skinner merely realizes

gives a very rational and 
decisive status to the in-
dividual. One, then, is in a 
position to effectively 
determine his own 
behavior . It is not 
necessarily a passive 
character. It is, however, 
the direct antithesis of 
Skinner's individual who is 
shaped and molded from 
birth with essentially 
nothing of his own to say of 
his developement or 
behavior, except for tho e 
limitations and capabilities 
presented by his physical 
makeup. It is really quite 
incongruous to snap these 
two opposing theories into 
some literary thrust which 
somehow supports the 
establishment . The only 
thing they have in common 
is that both are critical of 
the established method of 
socialization, but certainly 
don't agree on how to 
rectify it. 

Mr . Horowitz , then, 
extracts Pure Tolerance as 
the enemy in this instance. 
But certain facts must be 
remembered : In calling 
tolerance a 'politi cal' 
demand it must be realized 
that it is also a 'social ' 
demand . In order for 
so iety to exist stabily at a II 

triton 

there must be a certain 
degree of tolerance, and 
Pure Toleran e must be 
politically demanded by the 
estabalishrnent wh en 
dissatisfaction threatens a 
change in that present 
political order . In t rms of 
Mr. Horow itz's fear s. 
neither B.F. Skinner or T.A 
Harris, or ven our fe bl!' 
constitution, advocate Pure 
Tolerance . But if a corrupt 
and decadent ad-
ministration is making uch 
a demand, it is just one 
more reason for persevering 
to get it ousted . 

What Mr. Horowitz has 
done in his misrepresen-
tations is this : Within the 
context of his value system. 
he has the valid fear of Pure 
Tolerance. But what his 
article shows , and what. 
unfortunately, happens all 
too often in movements of 
any sort, where distant 
ideals are struggled for in 
dogmatic and inflexible 
societies, that the ideas, the 
initially drawn conclusions 
about man . become the 
reality from which facts are 
forCibly drawn to reprove 
the conclusion . In rational 
problem olving. however, 
theÂ· conclusion must be 
continually derived from

Film 
Executive Action 

G. E . Knoll 

These are reasons for you to see Executive Act ion, the 
film that postulates that an extensive conspiracy in-
cluding agents of the U.S.' government plotted and 
carried out the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy: 

1. Your metabolism is so strung out on devastating 
headlines by now that you will probably require a 
maintenance jolt while you wait out the next one . 

2. Executive Action's list of high-echelon bad men has 
many similarities to the ever-growing list of confirmed 
Watergate operators (big money men from Texas, CIA 
and other espionage types, fanatical an!i-Castro Cuban 
exiles, etc .) even though this thesis was largely con-
structed years bâ¬fore Richard Nixon became President. 

3. Some people in high places don't want you to see 
this movie. Three NBC stations, including KNBC in L.A ., 
have refused to carry advertising for Executive Action, 
charging that the ads are excessively violent . Check 
them out for yourseÂ·'f. If these stations applied this strict 
a standard to the rest of their programming, they would 
even have to cancel their old Get Smart reruns. 

reporters, "No sir, I didn't kill anybody ... I'm a patsy ." 
According to Freed and Lane, Oswa ld was not involved 
in the attempt, but rather was set up with an elaborate 
frameup that utilized a look-alike. The film-makers have 
one-upped the skeptics here by finding a remarkable 
look-alike to Oswald, James MacCall, to play that role in 
the fi lm. 

So Executive Action is not a first-rate work of art. It is, 
however, a rapid-paced historical adventure that may 
very well contain large elements of a frightening truth . 
The scenario of Executive Action is admittedly a highly 
educated guess, but it is consistent with the available 
evidence, a claim that the Warren Commission would 
be hard pressed to make for its own Report . 

You should see Executive Action because President 
I yndon Johnson believed some sort of conspiracy was 
involved in the assassination (a fact that is stated in the 
film's opening moments) a nd because two-thirds of the 
American public (according to both Gallup and Harris) 
think so, too. 

You should know that "assassination buffs" did not 
have to read in their newspapers that Nixon-appointed 
Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski got rich defending 
big Texas money - they predicted that from their 
knowledge of the history of the last ten years, just like 
they predicted the presence of Cuban exiles and CIA 
vets from the Bay of Pigs era in the Watergate caper 
itself. 

You do know that Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby 
never went to trial and you should know that eighteen 
material witnesses died, many by violent means, with in 
about three years of the assassination. 

You should be curious.

4. This month marks the 10th anniversary of the 
assassination of President Kennedy. If you haven't yet 
gotten into th'e weirdness surrounding the Warren 
Commission and its Report, it's a good time to sta rt. ,..---------------------...1 

Don't let me fool you, Executive Action is not a great 
film . It is probably not as persuasive as its authors in -
tended although I walked in the theater long-since 
persuaded, so I was not a good judge of that. Dalton 
Trumbo's screenplay shares many of the faults of the 
novel, Executive Action, by Mark Lane and Donald 
Freed. The dialogue, i n its efforts to convey so much 
factual information, often lacks grace. The characters of 
the conspirators lack the depth even to worry about 
getting caught, and there is often an air of melodrama 
about the proceedings that detracts from the 
believability of the film . Of the performers, only Robert 
Ryan manages to flesh out the limitations of his role 
more than occasionally. Burt Lancaster is coldly 
professional as the cold professional and though Will 
Geer might make a cred l> Ie Col. Sanders (if there is a 
credible Col. San.ders), as an omnipotent Texas oilman 
he doesn't cut it. 

Nonetheless, Execut ive Action should be seen. The

Music Dept. Premiers 
Magnetic Garden 

A U .S. premier per -
formance of Alvin Curran's 
Magnetic Garden will be 
presented by Roberto 
Laneri and Susan Gormlie 
of the UCSD Music 
Department , Tuesday, 
November 20, at 8:15 pm, 
in Recital Hall 409, Mat-
thews Campus. 

Alvin Curran, born in 
Rhode Island 35 years ago, 
is an American composer 
presently residing in Rome. 
He is one of the original 
members of " Musica 
Electronica Viva", one of 
the most influential and 
provacative new music 
groups during the past 
decade. Most of his music 
has been produced in his 
private electronic studio 
and is intended for per-
formance by various in-
struments and/or voices, 
tapes and live electronics. 
His major works include 
"Music for All Occasions", 
published by the Ex-
perimental Music 
Catologue in London . "The 
Magnetic Garden", his most 
recent and extended (1 'I, 
hours) composition , is 
designed for a so los recital 
situation, and so far has 
only been performed in 
Rome by the composer 
himself . For the American 
premiere he realized a 
version especially for Susan 
Gormlie and Roberto 
Laneri, whom he joined last 

summer in their vocal 
improvisation group. 

The distinctive qualities 
of Mr. Curran's work, both 
as an i mprovi sor and 
composer, are melodic and 
peaceful , a refreshing and 
original trait in today's 
music scene. "The 
Magnetic G.uden" promises 
an evening of relaxing yet 
intense musical experience. 

Susan E. Gormlie is 
presently working towards 
an MA in music at UCSD. A 
student of Elizabeth 
Hamiltom, harpsichord, she 
is the organist of the 
Mission San Diego de 
Alcala . She is also a 
founding member with 
Laneri, of the vocal group 
" Inner Voices". 

Roberto Laneri was a 
member of the Center of 
the Creative and Performing 
Art in Buffalo as 
clarinetist-composer; also 
of SEM Ensemble, directed 
by Pete Kotik. Com-
missioned by the dance 
company "Company of 
Man", to write the music for 
the production " Black 
Ivory", for the 50th an-
niversary of the Albright-
Knox Art Gallery . As a 
performer of new music he 
has given many solo recitals 
both in this cou ntry and 
abroad . 
The concert is free and 
open to the public.

Theatre Theatre 
Theatre : 

Generally speaking, it's highly unjust 
to review a show prior to its official 
opening, and whi le "Previews" of shows 
do exist, the realm of valid criticism 
doesn't seem fair ~() inflict onto a show 
until opening night. Hence, when I went 
to see a dress rehearsal of Status Quo 
Vadls at the Off-Broadway Theatre in San 
Diego on Monday night prior to their 
Wednesday opening, I had no intention 
of reviewing it at that time. 

The play, written by Donald Driver (of 
YOUR OWN THING fame) is more or less 
an unknown, receiving its West Coast 
premiere here. Perhaps the anonymity of 
the play was why I was so taken by 
surprise,but despite my fear of that genre 
of plays billed as "a new sex comedy", I 
found I actually erioyed the show quite a 
bit , and being unable to see the play's 
actual opening, I feel obligated to speak 
of the play now as opposed to never. 

The play is another of a string of all too 
cleverly constructed satires, poking 
disconcerting looks at our society's class 
structure, sexual moralities, politics and 
religion . On a literary level , one must 
realize that plays of this sort are just not 
destined to b come classic's of theatre, 
yet despite this basic problem which 
interposes whenever a script of this ~ort 
is used, Status Quo manages to redeem 
itself on a number of levels . 

The characters in the play all wear 
c lothing marked with numbers 
representing their particular class. The 
action of the play centers around an 
apprentice hole puncher of the five class 
(lower) named Horace Elgin, who aspires 
to be a poet and to come out of the muck 
of his class . His efforts to do so are 
helped by a three secretary in the cor-
poration, and a " liberated" lady who is 
daughter of the chairman of the board.

to form a ., ... ,nr,,'. 'nn set for the 
variety of progresses 
through . develop in 
almost resto fashion as the 
plot sinks icker as the 
ironic web of develop. 

As complex as i nd on paper, 
the play succeeds is energized 
by an intention al in some way 
offend all types y and punch 
holes in the t"h, ri.'" society. 
Despite some s charac-
terization of of socia l 
attitudes : Ii patriots, hard-
hats , clergy, etc, remain sol id 
as the ironies the charac-
terizations show of mostly 
co llege stld!nts that 
evening laughed roughout the 
t:'vening, and h. the how 
several times for to affi rm the 
truth of th play broadly 
illustrate. 

The sc ri pt is >rP â¢ .,~rprial , all the

to delivering, wrong hands,

formances which lity of th 
piece in focus, served to 
sharpen the h than to 
disperse it.

Joel Stedman. as th grad student 
bartender also turned in a nice per-
formance, with a good sense of timing 
and clarity of inten t and thought. 
Geraldine Kay, as Horace's mother turns 
in the evenings biggest show stopper in a 
hilarious scene in which the American 
Veteran 's League comes to her home to 
stifle her son's pornographic book of 
poems. 

The show. of course, was not without 
its weak moments, and at the time still 
possessed a number of technical 
problems. The pace of the show needed a 
degree of tightening up in a number of 
places, but keeping in mind that the 
show was still two full nights away from 
opening, there seems to be no cause for 
alarm . 

I' ll readily admit this piece is no 
Moliere, but it is better than the general 
popular theatre fare that seems to plague 
San Diego, and despite what flaws can be 
found with the production , the co llege 
crowd who attended Monday nights 
performance seemed to be enjoying it 
quite a bit . 

I ncidently, if the Off-Broadways pro-
theatre ticket prices have scared you 
away from this theatre in the past , 
college students will be interested in 
knowing that the Off-Broadway has 
instituted a new, half-price t icket policy 
for remaining eats one hour before 
, urtain . That means you can attempt 
'Sunday's matinee, or Saturday night's 
b:oo performance for two bucks . 

Yes, I could be more critical of Status 
Quo Vad ls, but I have to admit I enjoyed 
it very much, and for my money, that's 
worth quite a bit.

The UCSD Drama department is currently producing 

Thomton Wilders' The Skin of Our Teeth, which is 
undoubtedly Wilders' best work . As opposed to the dull , 
non-action home-spun philosophising of Our Town, The 
Skin of Our T~th is a funny, fast paced, universal-
message-to-all-mankind . Although Wilder cannot quit 
preaching, Skin is well enough written so that, if staged 
correctly, it works . 

Director Arthur Wagner has done an excellent pb of a 
very difficult show; coordinating the many technical 
aspects so that it flowed smoothly, and bringingout th e 
humor, satire, and meaningin a pleasant manner for the 
audience. The brilliant se t and lighting design by Dan 
Dryden COntributed greatly to the success of the show. 

Lee DeVin, as Antrobus, had the physical size, the 
booming voice, and the inspiration power required by 
the part. With a few minor lap s in the econd act, his 
acting job was truly supurb . Devin gave Antrobus the 
energy, excitement, sense of adventure, and desire to 
succeed which ' has helped Mankind (whom he

Mrs. Antrobus is supposed to be of the same hardy, 
robust ilk . Although Mindy Scott gives a terrific per-
formance, she is neither large enough nor homely 
enough to c'lrry the part physically . Ms Scott uses her 
acting ability (and good make up) to supply much of the 
power, strength of character, and determination of the 
plain Mrs. Antrobus, who doggedly holds her home and 
fa mily together despite the catastrophes of life, and th e 
Lilly Sabina's of the world . 

Lilly Sabina is the maid in the Antrobus household , 
who strives to climb "out of the kitchen" by use of her 
beauty, cleverness, and sex appeal. Sabina is the centra I 
character of the play, representing the "ordinary girl" 
who is out to get ahead in the world by any mea ns 
available . She is also the narrator and primary bestower 
of wisdom and philosophy. If done well, Sabina is one 
of the funniest, most sympathetic and believable 
females roles in theatre . There is no higher compliment

Music 
Classics in Review 

Perhaps I should begin this review by saying next time 
be sure to buy your tickets well before concert date. The 
presence of cellist Gregor Piatigorsky at a public 
concert was enough to sell out the house fully six weeks 
before concert time, as well it should . He presented a 
beautifully played and inspired concert with cellist 
Nathaniel Rosen and pianist Doris Stephenson under 
the auspices of the La Jolla Chamber Orchestra Recital 
Series . Although in semi-retirement and past 70 
Piatigorsky continues to turn wood into gold with hi~ 
elegant cello playing. 

The concert centered around Gian Carlo Menotti's 
(1911- ) Suite for two Cellos and Piano. This was 
written in honor of Piatigorsky's seventieth birthday, 
and was premiered last May 19 in Washington , D.C. by 
tht! sa me artists . This, then, was the West coast premiere 
of a pleasing and occasionally beautiful piece . 
Menotti writes in a melodic style that has seemingly 
be n forgotten by many of his contemporaries . 

Opening the concert was the two-cello arrangement 
of the one-cello Suite Italienne, which is an 
arrangement of Igor Stravinsky's (1882-1971) Pulcinella, 
itself based on themes of Pergolesi . The outcome has 
not weathered all this musical wear well, and the result 
is a bellicose dual for two cellos barely perceptable 
through the shower of horsehair and rosin . Fortunately, 
any doubts of ensemble among the performers was 
quickly dispersed by a delightful cello duo by Friedrich 
Kummer (1797-1879) and a deeply moving and dramatic 
account of the Brahms (1833-1897) E Minor Sonata for

Cello and Piano, Op . 38. Brahms. wrote two sonatas for 
cello and piano, in 18&5 and 188&. They present an 
interesting compari son between the highly structured 
work of a man of 32 and his more rhapsodic cou nterpart 
of 53 . Piatigorsky played the earlier work with poetry 
and drive, and only a greater contribut ion from Brahm's 
f irst love, the piano, could have improved the per-
forman ce. 

The concert cont inued with the Fantasy Pieces by 
Robert Schumann (181(}-1856). I have heard this piece 
played on several instruments, but never as successfully 
as this. Mr. Piatigorsky played them with the refulgent 
tone and mus ical insight that has characterized hi 
performances for half a century.

" It will change you, rearrange you, 
Gonna make you hard to take. 

Leave you feeling, that you're dealing, 
I n a world that's full of hate." 

The rhyming within the first and third lines of a stanza 
characterizes a few of Mason 's songs, and this always 
seems to add zest to the message he wants to put across. 

This fine album seems to be also an effort on Dave 
Mason's part to push the HEADKEEPER album out of the 
public eye and out of his mind completely . He had his 
differences with Blue Thumb records when they 
reJeased that album without his consent. Now, with the 
release of a new and much fuller version of the song 
HEADKEEPER along with the well-balan ced remainder 
of the record , he seems to be saying, "Now THIS is what

The Energy Crisis 

Goodman. To Speak On Petroleum U e 

Model of underwater " test tube" to be used in con-
trolled pollution experiment is demonstrated by the 
three Scripps scientis ts taking part. From left to r igh , 
Drs . Osmund Holm-Han sen, John R. Beers , and William 
H. Thomas. Fu ll-size "test tubes" will be 33 feet in 
diameter and almost 100 feet deep, enclosing 2,350 to ns 
of seawater in which a lgae and plankton will be grown 
under controlled pollution conditions. 

by Bob Nau 

Current approaches to the so-called "energy risi " 
may have dire consequences in their effects on th 
synthetic chemical industries. according to Murray 
Coodman. Professor of Chemistry and Provost of 
Revelle College. Dr. Goodman. who speCializes in 
synthetic organic chemistry. will speak on th iS subject 
next Monday night at 8:00 in the Revelle Informal 
Lounge. His talk will be entitled "Are Synthetic 
Molecules Good For Us?" and is sponsored by the 
Guest-in-Residence Committee. 

Many people may be unaware of the role petroleum 
plays as the basis for the synthetic chemical products 
which have become so vital to both the industrial and 
domestic sectors of our economy. Synthetic fibers . 
plastics and elastomers, pharmaceuticals, and cou ntless 
oth er mainstays of ou r elevated material existence are 
created by performing chemical transformations on the 
long chains of carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) 
which are the molecules comprising "petrol eum." Such 
diverse products as nylon, aspirin, and phonograph 
records are all made from petroleum. (I n fact. the 
record industry has already begun rationing vinyl , and 
this has been reflected locally in the piecemeal 
production of the KGB "Homegrown" album .) 

However. in the United States and most other in -
dustrial nations of the world today only about five to 
ten percent of the total petroleum consumed is used for 
synthetic chemical purposes. The rest is Simply burned 
to provide energy in automobiles, electric power pia nts . 
jet airplanes, factories, and home furnaces . The 

Controlled Pollution Experiment 
Three ScripPS scienti ts 

are participating in studies 
at Saanich Inlet, off 
Vancouver Island. B.C., to 
help forecast lon g-term 
effects of pollutants on 
marine life should these 
continueto be added to the 
world oceans at the present 
rate . 

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography has received 
two National Science 
Foundation (NSF) gra nts 
through the Office of the 
International Decade of 
Ocean Exploration totalling 
$ 186.300 to take part in th e 
project. 

The three San Diego 
investigators are Drs . John 
R. Beers, 0 mund Holm -
Hansen. and William H. 
Thomas of the Scrip ps-
based, Univer ity of 
Ca lifornia Institute of 
Marine Resources' Food 
Chain Research Group. 

They are part of an in-
ternational team of 
researchers from seven 
oceanographic orga n-
Izations that will 
con duct a Con trolled 
Ecosystem Pollution Ex-
periment (CEPEX) as part of 
N SF's I nternational Decade 
of Ocean hploration 
program. 

NSF has awarded seven 
research grants totalling 
$1 .276,400 to four U.S. 
institutions for the first two 
years of CEPEX. The ex-
periment has a projected 
total cost of $6 mi ll ion over 
a six-year period . 

"C EPEX is designed 10 
help man leitrn the long-
term effects of po II u ta nts 
on marine life and to 
forecast what the world 
oceans would be like in the 
year 2000, if pollutants 
continue to be added at the 
present rate." the Scripps 
scientists said . 

"Since plankton are at 
the base of the marine food 
pyramid . CEPEX will in-
ve tigate the effect su b-
lethal doses of chemical 
pollutants have on plankton 
communities. 

" To do this scientists 
want to contain natural 
populations of plankton in 
an enclosure which will not 
disturb their normal growth 
and development" . they 
explained. 

Plankton are tiny. often 
microscopic, drifting plants 
(phytoplankton) and 
animals (zooplankton) n 
the oceans that are used as 
food by fish. 

Case Existological 

Laboratories, Victoria, B.C., 
responding to these needs. 
designed a large, flexib Ie . 
plastic, underwater "test 
tube" . The container, which 
is 10 meters (about 35 feet) 
wide and 30 meters .( about 
98 feet) deep, is called a 
Contro lled Experimental 
Ecosystem Enclosure . It is 
suspended from the su rface 
like an up-t!nded si lo-open 
to the atmosphere, but 
closed at the bottom . 

For the major studies. 
which are scheduled to 
begin in September. 1974. 
six enclosures will be linked 
together in a honeycomb 
pattern and moored in 
Saanich I nlet. Each en-
c lo sure will hold in 
isolation about 2,350 tons 
of water for the duration of 
experiments . 

One-quarter-scale models 
of the test tubes were in -
sta ll ed in the Inlet during 
the past summer. They were 
supported by a moored 
float and then filled with 
pumped water with its 
entrapped population of 
marine plant and animal 
life. 

Dr. Thomas recently 
returned from Vanc.ouver 
Isla nd, where he conducte d 
tests on the models. "These 

engineering and biologic al 
tests were quite successfu I." 
he said . 

Before the fu II-scale 
enclosures are used, Drs . 
Thomas and Holm-Hansen, 
co-i nvestigators . wi \I 
conduct b ioassays at 
Scripps to test the effects of 
pollutants on small-volu me 
algal cultures and natu ra I 
population s of 
phytoplankton . 

Algal cu Itures from th e 
Inlet and phytoplankton 
from the waters off Scripps 
Pier in La Jolla, will be 
u til ized for the bioassays. 
" The difference in com-
position of the samples 
from La Jolla and the Inlet 
should not affect . the ap-
plication of our findings for 
Saanich In1et studies ," said 
Dr. Holm-Hansen . 

After the bioassays are 
completed. the scientists 
will add controlled amou nts 
of pollutants, such as heavy 
meta Is , pesticides . and 
petroleum hydrocarbons to 
the trapped columns of 
water at the I nlet. and will 
stu dy thei r effect 0 n th e 
marine life in the en-
closures.

and move things around. but we do not have anothel 
plentiful chemical base for our equally important 
synthetic products If we continue to rely on 
petroleum as a primary en rgy source. it will run out in 
the not-too-distant future The energy industries will 
then simply turn over to nuclear or other means of 
generating power. perhaps even at a lower cost than 
today's oi l-fi red generators. but t he petrochemical 
industri es will be forced to u e tedious . energy-
consuming methods to synthesize hydrocarbons and 
other complex organic molecules from elemental 
carbon . 

The burgeoning oil industry has traditionally con-
sidered sou rces of mining. techniques of transportation . 
and complexities of refin in g for fue l production to be 
the principal ingredients of their industry . The fact that 
th e marve llously comple x petroleum molecul s could 
be more efficiently used as starting points fo r valuable 
chemical t ransformatio ns has been only a secondary 
consideratio n. 

Thus today's " oil industry " is almost synomymous 
with energy production. Petroleum is curren t ly our 
biggest Single source of energy. with the burning of oil 
accounting for fully forty percent of energy production 
in the United States. Current proposals for dealing with 
th e energy crisis ca ll for that proportion to be ma in -
tained as far into the future as world petroleum 
resources will bear, which means that the rate at wh ich 
we are burning petroleum w i ll continue to increase with 
total energy consumption. 

Dr. Goodman feels that the oil industry should be 
reorganized so as to separate petroleum development 
from energy production . Although for as long as it lasts 
petroleum may contin ue to be the most convenient 
available energy source. it VoOuld be far more sensib Ie if 
we begin immediately turnmg to other sources. 
Petroleum resources could thus be increasingly reserved 
for a " molecule industry" which would concentrate on 
performing the most socia lIy beneficial transformations 
on the hydrocarbon molecules. and the remaining 
reso Irces ofthe existing oil industry would become part 
of a broadly-based " energy industry" which would 
develop non-petroleum sources. -

Dr. Goodman is apprehensive that the attention being 
focused on immenent energy shortages is being used as 
a lever to hasten the incorporation into energy 
production of our remaining petroleum reserves. The 
Alaska pipeline measure , which was stalled for several 
years by environmentalist lobbying. has suddenly been 
passed by lopSided ma jo rities in both hGv:.es of 
Congress, now that the economic implications of energy 
shortages are being pointed out. Similarly, the ad-
min istration has just called for a renewal of offshore 
drilling. which had flagged in the wake of the Santa 
Barbara disaster. Although the recent controversy over 
developing these resources has centered on ecologica l 
issues, in the long run our bitterest regret may be that 
we prematurely squandered them on energy production 
when they might have been put to a better use. 

It is thus increasingly important that in our decisions 
concerning the allotment of our petroleum resources we 
consider the larger situation of our future, instead of 
exploiting a "crisis" situation to promote hasty 
legislation aimed at short- term economic relief. Such 
decisions made under the gun are prec isely what we 
don't need at a time when farsighted planning is more 
necessary than ever if we are to keep our powerfu I 
technology from working to our detriment . 

The production and consumption of energy is the 
very foundation of modern society. and in the years to 
come we will become still more rel iant on our energy 
sources to keep us moving forward . However. there are 
many ways to produce energy, and some make more 
sense than others in the context of the total societal 
picture. In the case of petroleum. it would appear that 
the greatest benefit to society per molecule will be 
obtained by taking advantage of the natural complexity 
of the e molecules and transforming them into other 
u ful compounds. rather than burning them uP. and 
looking el ewh re for ource of enerJ;:Y. 

In his talk thi coming Mondaynight Dr Goodman 
will elaborate on the e points and illustrate them with

An impressive basketball 

game, laden with cou 13 ge 
and talent, was played 
Wednesday night in the 
UCSD gym . 

Leagues Alive and Well 

It was the first basketball 
game of the new season for 
the Tritons and they looked 
great. They moved the ball 
well and executed their 
plays many times to per-
fection . Their defense was 
superb, although they were 
playing a very superior 
team which had many years 
of experience on the you ng 
Tritons. They appeared to 
be a bit nervous, or suf-
fering from first-game blues 
and missed a number of 
shots that they would 
normally make. However, 
the game was a good one, 
there was large crowd and 
the cheerleaders were there 
performing. All in all it 
looks like a better than ever 
year for the Tritons. 

1M Football Playoffs 
Through midterms, 

papers, "Dear John" letters 
and life, the Intramural 
Football juggernaut rolls 
on . During each daily 
Armageddon, killer in -
stincts are appeased , 
frustrations are vented and 
mayhem is rechanneled . 

Though some claim that 
God is alive and well and 
can be seen wearing black 
and white-striped shirts on 
the UCSD fieid, others have 
found it in their hearts to 
give a more malevole nt 
characterization for the 
poor arbiters . 

Nero would miss only the 
lions, as the UCSD Circus 
Maximus provides all types 
of entertainment; cam ivai, 
mortal , tragic, moral , and 
comical- usually in com-
bination . 

Where else but on the 1M 
grid iron cou let. one see 
chivalry, alive but on the 
endangered species list, 
Neo-Renaissance masks and 
Neo-Neanderthal charac-

teristics all combined in 
one big show? 

World War I or II, for one 
reason or another, will be 
able to get a taste of what it 
was like weekends from 10 
a.m . onwards on the field 
between Revelle and Mur 
colleges. 

The story of the game lies 
in UCSD's opponents, the 
Atletes in Action . One must 
tru Iv admire their mission, 

More importantly, the 
best of all of the above will 
soon be matched in a 
struggle to the death , 
usually called " The 
Playoffs." 

The league of Spiro looks 
tough, even though the 
Baboons went undefeated . 
Three Spiro teams will make 
it into the playoffs. 

F rom the other less hyper . 
leagues, one represen tative, 
hopefully the best team, 
from each league will sally 
forth to do battle for the 
hand of the fair maiden; (or 
whatever the grand prize 
will be this year) .

UCSD City inhabitants,

Today and tomorrow will 
find the LX:SD Women's 
Swim Team up at the UC 
Santa Barbera Invitational 
in a final tune-up for the 
SCWAIC Championships to 
be held here December 1. 

This year's team has fared 
. well against teams with 
. such well -known ex-
Olympians as Da n 
Schoenfield, Ann Simmons 
and Kathy Moe, and it is 
Coach Becker's feeling that 
his girls will be in the thick 
of things in the up-<:oming 
events . 

T he two ex-Na tio nal 
ranked swimmers (Terri 
Fowler and Sue Starcevic) 
have fared well in com-

petition, but the surprises 
have come from the 
unknown girls on the team. 

Leading this year's team 
with the most points scored 
in the meets is Sheryl Stack, 
a 5'3" sophomore from La 
Habra. 

SurpriSing times have 
also been turned in by 
Diane Harvey, laurie Sinon 
and Maury Bandurraga, but 
more important is the effort 
put in by all of the giris on

Lighting V andaliz~d 
With tennis courts at a veritable premium at UCSD, it 

seems a shame that some people find time to go out of 
their way to lessen the n umber of courts which can be 
used by everyone at night. 

Yet, this is exactly what has been happening . Some 
unknown person or persons are responsible for com-
pletely ripping off (litera Oy) a switch which turns on the 
lights for at least one court . The person or persons have 
also tampered with the power boxes for the lights on 
numerous occasions . 

If such actions are allowed to continue unchecked, 
the big losers will be everyone who enjoys playing 
tennis at night, and this probably inclucles most people 
on campus. . 

Therefore, If you experience diHiculty with the 
lighting on the court you are using, PLEASE, do not 
tinker with the switches or power boxes by the courts . 
Instead, notify a PE staH member, and an attempt will 
be made to reniedy th is situation . 

If you notice anyone tampering with the switches, 
power boxes or lights in any way, try to convince them 
to stop, and if this does not succeed, report it im-
mediately to the PE staH or campus authorities . 

The lights onc" went out in New York City-we hope 
they will not nave'lo go out here at UCSO.

Christian 
De-emphasis 
Editor: 

I am writing in objection 
to Christian Emphasis 
Week . My objection is 
twofold against (1) the 
promotion of, and (2) the 
emphasis of , Christian 
Emphasis Week. 

I can think of to pay Pamela Pascoe than to say that she 
was Lilly Sabina, and the audience loved every second 
of her performance . 

It is unfair to slight any of the fine actors and ac-
tresses who tumed in such enjoyable characterizations 
under the master guidance of Arthur Wagner, and you 
wou Id not be able to appreciate their skill nor the tru e 
genius of Thornton Wilder by reading of them in this 
column. 

UCSD possesses an excellent drama department, and 
they are presenting a masterpiece of theatre which will 
end its run this weekend at the UCSD Theatre. Curtain 
time is at 8:00 PM, and the pleasure you will receive 
from witnessing this odyssey of Man is well worth the 
slight price of admission. See it. 

Opening this weekend is another smash comedy, 
Happy Birthd4ly, Wanda June, the author of which, Kurt 
Vonnegut, Jr. , many of you will recognize from such 
great nove~ as Cat's Cradle, God Bless You, Mr. 
Rosewater, and Slaughterhouse No. S. Wanda June 
opens November 15 thru 18 and continues the 22 thru 
25 at the Puppet Theatre in Balboa Park, with an 8:30 
PM curtain . 

The group presenting Vonnegut's high ly acclaimed 
adu lt farce bills themselves as "The San Diego Living 
Theatre, a newly-formed C<Xlperative theatre en-
semble", which is a fancy name for a repertory com-
pany. Due to the noticable paucity of professional 
theatres (the only one is the Off Broadway, which uses 
the Star System, and does not rely heavily on San Diego 
acting talent) in San Diego, the Living Theatre will be a 
welcome addition to the entertainment facilities of the 
city . 

If the Living Theatre can supply the normally high 
caliber of theatre we have come to expect from such 
theatres as The Old Globe, The Mission Playhouse, and 
The Off Broadway, it will deserve the support of the 
citizens. of San Diego, a nd wi II be a decided blessin,g t? 
the actors of San Diego in terms of being paid for their 
work . The play is, under the direction of Michael Kelly. 

Tickets for Wanda June are available by calling 284-
8483, and run $3.00 for adults, $2.50 for students and 
military, and $1 .50 for children. However, Wanda June 
is not recommended for those under seventeen. 

Who has authoriz d this 
debacle? The title sounds 
official-- is it the University 
that has proclaimed this 
week? It seems unlikely, but 
if so, the University is out of ' 
order- it is a violation of 
regUlations to promote or 
sponsor religious or

political organizations. It is r-----------, 
more reasonable to assume 
that a group of self -
righteous Christians 
proclaimed CEW. If so, by 
making the title so of-
ficious, they are purposely . 
deceiving people with a 
false pretense of "oHicial" 
sanction- a very Christian 
thing to do. It smacks of the 
same good Christian zeal 
that has brought the White 
House its present notoriety. 

A more benevolent and 
toleranl (re member 
Tolerance?) attitude would 
have been to declare a 
" Religious Emphasis Week," 
but these people were so 
full of Christian love and 
brotherhood as to exclude 
Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, 
Agnostics, etc., from the 
name of their seven sacred 
days. But of course, those 
heathens and savages are 
full of the Devil , and just 
might have messed up the 
works . 

More signifigantly, I 
object to emphasizing 
Christianity . Are they 
emphasizing Christian 
history (the crusades and 
inquisition are marvelous 
examples)? Or do they 
emphasize Christian Values 
(love thy neighbor--only if 
he's of your faith)? Or 
perhaps Christian theology 
(which has given us the 
concept of original sin-a 
millstone for mankind as a 
collective gui It complex, 
and for the individual man 
an almost unbearable 
burden of being by nature 
wicked , depraved, and 
evi l)? Maybe they are 
emphasizing enlightened 
Christian moral and sexual 
standards. 

Emphasizing Christianity 
to the exclusion of equally 
valid and valuable religions 
and philosophies I find to 
be offensive and op-
probrious. With this in 
mind, I propose that the 
entire month of December 
be declared " Non-Christian 
Emphasis Month" .

Untitled 
coaching of Jimmy King, 
who just arrived on thE' 
scene in the last year, the 
team appears to be heading 
for even more success. 
Their game is very 
reminiscent of the Bulls, 
slow, patient and setting up 
their shot . Their biggest 
advantage is that they very 
rarely miss a shot - an 
advantage for any team .

IS what takes place at 
halftime . Some of th 
players get out on the court 
and reveal to the specta tors 
the ir te sta monies con-
ce rning their Christian 
beliefs. If you have even 
gotten in front of a crowd 
(not a very friendly one at 
that as many witnessed at 
the gam ) alone, with a 
microphone. and started 
tell ing the audience how 
you accepted a belief , no 
matter what kind of belief it 
is whether it be Chr i tianity 
or Buddha or whatever. it 
takes a lot of courage . 
Credit mu st be give n to
