Life in "Back 0' Town" New Orleans 

Storyville: Old Style Musical 
by Sara J. Lowen 

Staff Writer 
';Storyville," which premiered Wednesday night 

in the Mandeville Auditorium, is a musical in the old 
Hollywood tradition, where plot and character are 
of secondary importance to the singing and da~ 
cing. 'l'he action of Storyville centers around the 
seamy Back O'Town section of New Orleans where 
prostitution, the drug trade and jazZ flourished in 
the early 1900s. 

But the ploUine could take place in any musical 
comedy locale. Butch "Cobra" Brown is a cham-
pion boxer who comes to town with hopes of 
becoming a jazz musician. He is smitten with 
Tigre Savoy (pronounced Tee-gray in true New 
Orleans dialect,) a local cabaret singer who also 
has dreams of making it big in music. Tigre is 
initially frosty toward Butch's advances but soon 
falls for him. Their relationship is threatened when 
an opium-smuggling French baron tempts Tigre 
with an offer to make her a famous chanteuse, and 
by Butch's lapse of faithfulness with a local whore. 
But the two are eventually reconciled and form a 
band, with hopes of heading for stardom. 

The characters, as well as the plot, are easily 
recognizable standards from musical comedy. 
Despite the tough realities of their existence, they 
all display innocence and cheerfulness in their 
situation. Butch has a Mickey Rooney optimism 
that he can make it big if he only gets a break. 
Tigre, despite her aloofness and independence 
shares Butch's faith in the 'big break'. Eveh Mickey 
P. Mulligan, the huckster who runs the local night 
club and sidelines in pimping and drug trafficking is 

'harmless. And the predatory whores who populate 
the Back O'Town section are good-natured for all 
their bitchiness. 

This innocence and typicality of the characters, 
however, is part of Stocyville's chann. And the ' 

F:ve rybody's all smiles as the tale 0/ Storyuille draws to 
a close . 
show is at its best when it turns the unreality and 
silliness of the characters into the delightful, full-
blown absurdity of musical comedy. The numbers 
'Nobility,' 'Notorious' and 'Boulevardier' are the 
best examples of this, with the wonderfully ~ 
congruous Baron strolling in the Maurice Chevalier 
style with the raffish Back O'Town gang. The other 
high points of the show are the musical numbers 
which recreate the jazz spirit of the quarter, such' 
as, 'Feel that Jazz,' 'The Best is Yet to Be' and 
'Razzy Dazzy Jazzy Spasm Band.' 

Ernestine Jackson's singing provides some of the 
best dramatic moments in the ~w, conveying her 
anguish in 'Riffs and Breaks,' independence in 
'Prove It' and melancholy in 'Demi-Monde.' 
Jacksoo was also the stand out in her portrayal of 
the sultry, reserved Tigre, showing the spunk, 
frustration. Brian Mitchell was engaging as Butch 
"Cobra" Brown, showing the necessary innocence 
and optimism of a musical comedy star. Mitchell 
also had a fine voice and moved well on stage. 

Marcia Robinson's portrayal of Fifi Foxy, the 
~ regal whore of the Back O'Town quarter co~ 
8 tributed some of the best comedic moments of the 
~ play. Norval Rader was delightful as the Baron with 
~ his phony French accent. And James Avery as Hot 
8 Licks Sam best represented the reckless energy of 
o the Back O'Town jazz with his cortege of 
; musicians. The principals were ably supported by 

the competent singing and dancing of the rest of the 
Resident spiritualist Momma Stringbean [Evelyn cast, which showed particular energy and unity in 
Bo oker] and hope/ul boxer cum Jazz musician Butch such numbers as 'Nobility and the Best is Yet to Be.' 
"Cobra" Brown [Brian Mitchell] do a song and dance . Continued onPege 3 

And Now for The Good News ... 

Doctor Predicts Drought, Famine, Ice Age 
by Michael Slater 

What do earthquakes, birds 
flying down chimneys, 
malnutrition and the cold winters 
back east have in common? They 
are all symptoms of a rapidly 
cooling climate, Dr. Irwin E. 
Kaplan, a founding member of the 
International Institute for 
Integrative Technology, told the 
Fonun of the Institute of Continued 
Learning (ICL) last Friday. 

Kaplan said that a world famine, 
caused by drought, is currently in 
progress with the result being 
hundreds of millions of people 
dying. He also predicted the onset 
of a new Ice age, in as little as four 
or five years, if future winters are 
as severe as the last one. 

He attributed the cooling effect 
to the decay of radioactive 
materials and the fixation of 
cnrbon dioxide in carbonate rock 
by sea organisms. 

Kaplan said that a decrease in 
world temperature of eight to ten 
degrees would initiate a new ice 
age. He also noted that the rate of 
cooling has been increasing at an . 
exponential rate, especially since 
1940, despite the 20 percent ~ 
crease of carbon dioxide co~ 
centration caused by industrial 
production. 

Saying that a five percent i~ 
crease in carbon dioxide levels 
raises world temperature by one 
degree due to the greenhouse ef-
feet, Kaplan combined the one and 

a half degree observed drop with 
the four degree expected rise in 
C'Oncluding that the world is more 
than half way to a new ice age. 

A Global Ice Age? 
Kaplan said that the only way to 

prevent a global ice age would be 
to increase the temperature of the 
world by increasing the amount of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
He suggested a 300 to 400 percent 
increase In world industrial 
production and an increase in 
population, calling it the "hwnan 
ferment." He also maintained that 
as much fossil fuel as possible be 
burned, urging the audience to 
"disregard the president's idea of 
fuel conservation," saying It would

Leifer will ProPQse 
New Student Advocate 

by Reed Alpert 
Staff Writer 

Losing the battle against a seemingly insurmountable problem? Help 
might be on the way in the form of the new Student Advocate's Office. 

Jeff Leifer, the newly elected ASUCSD President, said in a Triton 
Times interview that he and Barry Hyman, Commissioner of student 
Welfare, " are considering requesting that new matters come under the 
purview of the Commissioner of8tudentWelfare. We are trying to develop 
a Student Advocate's Office to provide help for students who are lost in 
any academic or non-academic matters. It will deal with grievance 
concerns, from curriculum problems to personal conflicts. 

"Grade appeals would also be addressed by the Student Advocate," 
continued Leifer, "but we also have the Academic Senate Grade Appeals 
Corrunittee to deal with grade appeals formally. In addition, we want to 
centralize a grievance procedure to involve specific discriminatory 
situations. " 

The Student Advocate Office is being modeled after the Berkeley 
system and will consist of two student advocates and one ombudsman, 
both of whom will be under the Commissioner of Student Welfare. 

In discussing the n~w ASUCSD government, Leifer said the ASUCSD 
Council is currently assessing such student problems as the library 
proposal, getting voting priveleges on Academic Senate Committees, and 
improving the various fonns of communications at UCSD. . 

. Attendlug Convention 
Today Leifer is in Los Angeles attending the Federal Bar Association's 

annual Student Rights Convention. It is, according to Leifer, "a panel of 
the top 40 student rights experts, law professors and Ralph Nader types 
presenting cohesive and critical views of the pressing problems with 
student rights and responsibilities." 

The topics of discussion will include the consequences of the Bakke 
decision, how to increase Federal aid to higher education and how to 
insure that students are receiving procedural due process on the campus. 

In terms of statewide concerns, Leifer has currently designated Bob 
Drapeau, Commissioner of External Affairs, to be the ASUCSD 
representative to the Student Body President's Council (SPBC). 

"My time is much more needed on campus for student and local 
needs," said Leifer. " I will attend SPBC meetings whenever the ASUCSD 
Council deems it necessary or whenever I feel it is crucial. We are also 
finalizing the budget for our contribution to the UC Student Lobby. This 
way we have clout in local matters by going outside the University to the 
twelfth most powerful lobby in California as well as having crucial 
corrununication with the state on all Sacramento issues." 

New Avenues of Information 
Leifer would like to see more avenues of information open up between 

the students and the ASUCSD. He has a mailbox in Student Affairs above 
EDNA and urges all students to use it. He also plans to put a suggestion 
box on the EDNA desk and have a bi-weekly newsletter or column in the 
campus print medium. 

Leifer ended the interview by expressing his thanks on behalf of the 
ASUCSD government to the students for showing their concern with the 
issues in the past election, and urged continued support in helping form a 
workable team that is responsive to student needs. 

Committee ·Makes Request: 
FuU UC Public Disclosure 

by Hugh Macintosh 
SACRAMENTo-An Assembly 

subcommittee voted last week to 
ask the University of California to 
require members of its faculty and 
administration to make full public 
disclosure of their outside co~ 
sulting activities. 

The Ways and Means Sub-
committee on Education asked 
that the University require 
disclosure statements when ~ 
come from consulting activities is 
more than $250. Each statement 
would describe the activity, tell 
whom it was for, how long it lasted 
and where it took place. 

The disclosures would tell if the 
income from each source was 
between $250 and $1000, between 
$1000 and $10,000, or more than 
$10,000. The subcommittee also 
asked that positions on the ~rds 
of private profit and nonprofit 
organizations be disclosed. 

The subcommittee's action was 
prompted by testimony given 
before it over the past two months. 
In March the subcommittee had 
been surprised to learn that UC 
professors are allowed to spend up 
to one day per week in outside paid 
consulting activities. 

At that time Berkeley physics 
professor William Fretter, chair of 
the Academic Council, told the 
subcommittee that a recent survey 
showed about ten per cent of the 
faculty at Berkeley take advantage 
of this policy. • 

Outside Consulting 
At a subsequent hearing in April, 

Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post 
told the subcommittee that it is 
" desireable" for UC faculty to do 
outside consulting work. He said 
consulting is an " integral part" of 
the role of the nlversity. 

But other witnesses at the April 
hearing testified that the co~ 

sulting policy is abused by some 
professors. In a study presented to 
the subcommittee, Berkeley 
physics professor Charles 
Schwartz recommended annual 
public reports as a first step 
toward dealing with the abuses. 

As a state agency, the University 
of California is required by the 
Political Reform Act of 1974 to file 
a conflict-of-interest code with the 
Fair Political Practices Com-
mission. The university has been 
developing such a code since early 
1976. 

At the hearing on Monday, UC 
Vice President Chester McCorkle 
said the code had been completed 
and will be submitted to the FPPC. 
He added, however, that the 
faculty is not included in the code.

Open Letter to Howard Hunt 

Women Care Needed 
The Feminist Coalition is deeply concerned over the lack of adequate 

health care for women at UCSD. Specifically, the high cost of necessary 
gynecological examinations (pap smears, pelvic and breast exams) is a 
forcelul deterrent for many a woman when she considers having these 
cancer-testing examinations. 

At this time, a woman desiring the annual cancer tests is referred to the 
Birth Control ClInic, whether or not she desires birth control, and is 
charged $10.00 for the examination. As you probably know, the reason for 
this high cost is a result of the Birth Control ClInic being completely 
autonomous from the Health Center and as such, it does not receive any 
of the registration fee money stu4ents pay each quarter. 

Since women students are already paying $33 from reg fees every 
quarter for their health care, and since pap smears, pelvic and breast 
exams are necessary tests to Insure a woman's good health, the Feminist 
Coalition and many other students feel that this part of gynecological 
care. for women should be incorporated Into the current student health 
care plan. The excess cost of $10 should also be elimlnated. 

You have recently been receiving short notes from many students 
telling you of their support of this issue. The Feminist Coalition has been 
soliciting these letters, plus signatures -on a petition, In order to 
demonstrate the support on this campus for gynecological care for 
women at no extra cost. We feel there is a broad base of support among 
both men and women students, as evidenced by the recent referendum 
(over 2000 "yes" votes for this Issue) and by the personal contact ~e have 
had with students_ We are hoping that you will also give us your full 
support. 

The women students at UCSD deserve adequate health care. Only by 
providing these basic, life-savlng gynecolOgical services at no extra cost 
wiD health care needs of women students be mel 

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. A fact 
sheet about services at other UC campuses is provided for your in-
formation. -

[Editor's nole: The f"ct sheet the Feminist CoaUtion sent to Interim 
Vice-Chancenor HlDlt Includes the fonowlng Items: 

- While the price of an annual pap smear at tbe UCSD Healda Center 
is $10, the cost at tbe other eight UC campuses averages .$4, except at 
UCLA and UC San Francisco, where they are "free of excess cbarge" 

- Only at UC Davis and UC Berkeley do students pay more than the 
$33 UCSD cbarges from reg fees for student bealth services. But all eight 
ues provide cheaper gynecological service than UCSD.

against the university and the 
FPPC to block submission of the 
code. 

The professors claim the

because it was created by the state 
constitution as an independent 
corporation. It would therefore not

Technically, the show ,ran 
smoothly except for a few minor 
problems with noisy set changes 
and ill-fitting costumes. The spare 
set effectively suggested the at-
mosphere of the Back O'Town 
section. The vibrant colors of the 
costumes by Elan heightened the 
ta wdry glamour of the quarter . 

The play was written by Ed

be " suicide" to use less fuel. He 
also suggested spreading deserts 
and snowfields with coal dust to 
increase temperature. 

Urging members of the Forum to 
write govenunent leaders and 
demand an emergency bill, Kaplan 
said that we may have already lost 
a billion people. Additionally, he 
cited the increasing numbers of 
tornadoes and earthquakes as 
he log caused by the coollng trend. 

Kaplan predicted rapidly in-
creasing food costs during the next 

triton times 
years, citing masses of cold water 
in both oceans and high pressure 
cold air over the poles, and said " it 
seems almost impossible to have 
anything but droughts. " 

The pessimistic speech did have 
one optimistic note, in that Kaplan 
saw great possibilities in the future 
for the world from the use of fusion 
teclmology.
