SANTEE, Calif. - Investigators 
said on Tuesday that the shootings 
Monday at Santana High School 
were not a sudden emotional out-
burst, but a planned, calmly execut-
ed assault by a 15-year-old student 
carrying as many as 40 rounds of 
ammunition. 

Lt. Jerry Lewis, who is heading 
the investigation for the San Diego 
County Sheriffs Department, said 
the suspect, Charles Andrew

UCSD Medical School's 
Harold Simon Honored 
Anonymous donation creates new position 
while recognizing founding dean 

Staff Writer 

Dr. Harold). Simon, a found-
ing father of the UCSD School of 
Medicine and world leader in 
international medicine, has been 
honored with the recent estab-
lishment of an endowed chair in 
his name. 

An anonymous donor gave a 
large sum of money to see the 
creation of a new position in the 
medical school and ensure that 
the name of that position will 
honor the lifetime achievements 
of Simon. The chair is in recogni-
tion of Simon's role in the design 
of health care systems serving 
developing nations and his lead-
ership in developing cultural 
awareness among UCSD medical 
students. 

Simon said he was gracious to 
have the chair position named in 
his honor. 

"A lot of people who don't 
deserve thin.r. like this get it: 
Simon said. A lot of people who 
do deserve it get it. I don't know 

, 

if I have done anything extraordi-
nary, but I'm very grateful for the 
honor." 

The gift and honor are 
intended to serve two functions. 
Primarily, the chair is to honor 
Simon's work. It will also allow 
the Medical School to recruit 
new talent to the UCSD School 
of Medicine. 

"Simon has been an interna-
tional leader in Europe and most 
of the Western world: said 
Robert M. Kaplan, chairman of 
the Department of Family and 
Preventative Care. "He has been 
an important shaper in the 
UCSD School of Medicine and it 
is very nice that someone wants 
to honor him in this way." 

Kaplan also saw the open 
position as a chance for the med-
ical school to do something dif-
ferent. Simon has been at the 
school of medicine since before 
any students had arrived. He 
came to UCSD in 1966, after 
being recruited from Stanford

Dr. Drew and 
Adam Corolla 
CometoUCSD 
Sold out Loveline event draws 
students for relationship advice 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

Just under 500 people attended a sold-out 
"Loveline with Adam Corolla & Dr. Drew· Monday 
night at the Price Center Theater. 

Vicky Bender, A.S. commissioner of programming 
and one of the show's main coord inators, said the 
show was a success due to the hard work of the staff 
as well as the easygoing nature of both guest celebri-
ties. 

"Adam and Drew were really easy to get along 
with: Bender said. "They even said how they had a 
good time at UCSD later that night on 91 X." 

Bender was referring to how the two went straight 
from UCSD to San Diego radio station 91 X to record 
their nationally syndicated show "Loveline." 

Days before the event, the radio station promoted 
the event on the air and gave out complimentary tick-
ets. 

Corolla and Drew stepped on stage at approxi-
mately 7:20 p.m. to the applause of an at-capacity 
crowd of students, staff members and other members 
of the community. Corolla began the night by joking 
abou t how much he preferred UCSD to SDSU. 

"When I think of UCSD, I'll think of great 
drainage: said Corolla, rcferring to the campus' high 
elevation and how efficiently the drains redirect rain 
water. 

Corolla and Drew went on to answer questions 
from the audience the rest of the night. Topics dis-
cussed ranged from the origins of their current sllccess

Revelle Celebrates 
Founder's Birthday 
Students enjoy free food and Entertainment 
at annual event commemorating first dean 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

Gloomy skies and thc threat of 
rain did not deter hundreds of 
hungry students from a barbecue 
yesterday afternoon honOring the 
founder of UCSD, the late Roger 
Revelle, on what would have been 
his nnd birthday. 

The annual event, fittingly 
held at Revelle Plaza, lured stu-
dents, staff and faculty from all 
over campus with a free barbecue 
lunch complete with cake and an 
entertainment. 

"This is cool: said Revelle stu-
dent Celine Sanchez regarding 
the event. 

Although people came for the 
food, the true meaning of the 
event was not lost on those in 
attendance. 

"Happy birthday Roger 
Revelle; Jessica Slocomb said. 

Revelle Provost Thomas Bond 
remembered Revelle fondly. 

"This is fitting for a Roger 
Revelle birthday celebration; he 
loved things like this: Bond said. 

"He would wear the funny little 
hats." 

Roger Revelle attended the 
event regularly until his passing 
in 1991 . His widow ha~ attended 
past celebrations but was absent 
yesterday. 

The UCSD community has 
Revelle to thank for establishing 
the campus. He persisted throug~ 
many controversies to realize his 
dream of the opening of a world-
class institution here in 1960. 

The event was sponsored by 
the Revelle Programming Board 
in conjunction with the 
Commuter Activity Board. Lance 
Feller, co-chair of the RPB, was 
pleased with the turnout. 

"We will have people until we 
run out of food: Feller said. 

Aside from pleasing the mass-
es who came for the free barbe-
cue, Feller sees the celebration as 
a way for students to "remain 
aware of the history of Revelle."

invaluable contributions Revelle

52-33-28 Rally In Support of 
Affirmative Action Thursday 

Students from a statewide coalition have 
been working to pressure the UC Regents to 
repeal SP1 and SP2. policies that have eliminat-
ed affirmative action from the admissions and 
hiring practices of the University of California. 

A rally will be held Thursday at noon in the 
Price Center Plaza to promote the cause. 
Proponents of the repeal of the policies argue 
that the institution of SP1 and SP2 caused the 
population of blacks admitted to UCSD to drop 
significantly with each freshman class. Fifty·two 
were admitted three years ago when the policies 
went into effect and the number dropped to 28 
with the most recent freshmen class. In addl· 
tion. proponents of the repeals say that SP1 and 
SP2 have led to a drop in female faculty at UCSO 
to 32. 8 percent.

Williams might be imprisoned for 
the rest of his life if he is convicted or

There is concern here about the 
number of students. and at least one 
adult. who heard Williams make 
threats that he was prepared to 
shoot people at the school. Granger 
Ward. superintendent of the school 
district. said that three students who 
h'ave acknowledged they were aware 
of the threats would not attend

It also appears that one student

Will Hurt Students 
Pressed for Time 

The UCSD administration recently 
began to consider a proposal that would 
eliminate five minutes from the current 15-
minute interval between classes. The pro-
posal's supporters argue that adopting a 10-
minute passing period would eliminate 
ineffici ent use of classroom space, which 
would im prove the effects of the over~ 
crowding. trend that plagues UCSO: 

The Guardian believes the 10-minute 
passing period will be an overly burden-
some, quick-fix solution to a pressing prob-
lem that instead deserves less onerous, 
long-term solutions. 

Specifically, the administration failed to 
recognize and address the effects that cam-
pus overcrowding would undoubtedly have 
on classroom availability. Had campus offi-
cials begun planning classroom complexes 
fou r years ago, when overcrowding trends 
in on-campus housing and parking began 
to indicate that the university needed to 
prepare for an annually increasing number 
of enrollees, the classroom crunch would 
not have become su ch a dire situation. 

Ultimately, there is no reason the admin-
istration could not have foreseen a shortage 
in classroom space and begun preparing for 
it years ago by constructing new buildings 
- a move that may not be as feasible now, 
because it takes several years to move for-
ward with building proposals. 

Now the administration is attempting to 
find a solution at the expense of the quality 
of student life. 

Ju~t the impossibility of traveling between 
certain lecture haILs in only 10 minutes indi-
cates that this policy is too much for students 
to bear. Having suffered several losses 
through the implementation of high-profile, 
yet ultimately ineffective parking and hous-
ing growth plans, students should reject this 
plan, which is simply the administration's 
newest attempt to shift the costs of its poor 
planning onto the student population. 

Instead of adopting the 10-minute pass-
ing period , the administration should 
immediately plan for new classroom com-
plexes, which would provide long-term 
improvements to classroom crowding. 

In addition, more required courses should 
be offered during summer sessions. If stu-
dents can complete prerequisites and gener-
al education courses during summer, the 
need for these courses to be offered every 
quarter of the standard academic year will 
decline, thus freeing up classroom space. If 
this is chosen as a method of amel iorating 
classroom crowding, the administration 
would be wise to offer evening summer 
courses so that students are meanwhile able 
to maintain summer jobs or internships.

School Shooting Indicates A Need for 
Refonn in Our Competitive Society 
Society's pressure on individuals to be better than their peers fosters an 

environment in which anti-social behavior lurks below the surface 
., SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Once again, we woke up to the news 
that a hjh school student aimed a 
weapon at his classmates and started 
shooting. This time the episode left an 
even deeper mark, because it happened 
so close to home. Location should not 
make any difference but, understandably, 
it does. 

Once again, we are left with a knot of 
contrasting feelings. The pity for the vic-
tims and their families; the disconcert at 
how something like this could happen 
again; the blind, if humanly understand-
able, rage of those who call for more 
security and tougher sentences. To this 
we should add a dose of Christian pietas 
for the murderer, but this seems out of 
fashion these days. 

Yet this flurry of feelings, and the 
often draconian measures that it 
inspires, is always directed at the single 
episodes. failing to see the preoccupying 
pattern that lies behind these instances. 
A whole generation seems taken by a 
self-destructive fury, which can take sev-
eral forms: the lust for self-destruction 
of the drug user, or the willingness to 
in fl ict destruction on the part of the per-
son who picks up a gun . In any case, they 
are symptoms of a social malaise that we 
still do not recognize in all its serious-
ness. 

Our gore-hungry media give us 
news only of pa rti cu larly dramatic 
occu rrences like school shootings, but 
'these rest upon a substratum of teen 
violence in the inner ci ties, gang vio-
lence and so on . 

School shootings are not "normal" 
murders (even if such a thing as a normal 
murder exists). The kids who shoot do it 
wi th fu ll knowledge that they will be 
arrested and tried. They do not try to 
hide their identities and in some cases (as 
in the Columbine shooting), they start 
their rampage with a lucid sujcidal inten-
tion. 

These are not normal crimes, and 
calls to barbaric and useless measures 

like trying minors as adults will not help 
understanding. Understanding is what 
we need, now more than ever. 

It is true that adolescents have always 
been and always will be destructive and 
disruptive and have a conscious desire to 
break away from their parents and the 
society they represent. This is a healthy 
part of their growing process and an 
important component of raising social 
awareness. 

The intensity and frequency of mani-
festation such as murderous rages or sui-
cidal drug habits, which know no barri-
ers of,geography, race or economic sta-

One Of the most important 
components of an iuiolescent 
life .is the need to belong. But 
we indoctrinate adolescents 
with the idea that such a 
desire is a weakness, because 
it diminishes competitiveness, 

tus, however, make one wonder whether 
there is something more in the scream of 
desperation that a whole generation is 
sending us. 

How responsible are we, the adults, 
for this malaise? What do we know of 
this generation? Its members grow up 
alone in families too burdened by long 
working hours or hectic schedules to 
give them real support; they are sur-
rounded by the material wealth and the 
barren human contact of suburban life. 

They grow in an environment in 
which the only occasions to socialize are 
connected to the consumption of goods. 
A mall is not a place where a person 
learns to stay with people, but when was 
the last time you saw in your neighbor-
hood a community center, or even a piaz-
za? 

We are going to extraordinary 
lengths not to teach our children the 
basic ski lls of human interaction. 

Sometimes we do this to shield them, 
since human interaction is often 
painful. Sometimes we do it because we 
are too self-absorbed or because the 
pressure on us doesn't ev~n leave us 
any space for human interaction. The 
results are equally tragic. . 

One of the most important compo-
nents of an adolescent life is the need to 
belong. . 

But we indoctrinate adolescents with 
the idea that such a desire is a weakness, 
because it diminishes competitiveness. 
We show them that one must conform to 
the norms of the group (otherwise he will 
be a "weirdo") and, at the same time, not 
ask the group for help (otherwise he will 
be a "loser"). 

Very soon in his life a child is taught 
that he must be self-reliant, competitive 
and a leader. Very soon he is taught 
(either directly or through example) 
that winning is the only thing that mat-
ters and that a winner is necessarily 
alone. 

Are we pushing children too far with 
too many activities and commitments, 
mostly for the parents' own gratifica-
tion? Are we not letting them be chil-
dren, play with children, fight with chil-
dren, possibly beat each other up to learn 
those boundaries and confidences that 
constitute a social body? 

We are a society of vCJ:¥ lonely people, 
and children see that. We are a society in 
which males are taught to be afraid of 
intimacy and not to trust each other. Are 
we sure that the too-good children of 
today are not preparing the desperate, 
self-destructive adolescents of tomor-
row? . 

I wish I knew. I have, alas, only ques-
tions. 

A whole generation has been subject 
to a cruel experiment of social Darwin-
ism: Let them grow alone, in families too 
distracted to follow them adequately, and 
in an urban environment leading to 
loneliness. Let them be educated since 
childhood to cQmpete and to prevail over

Judge Deals Microsoft a Bad Hand College Community Service 
Should Be a Requirement Government unfairly forces software giant to break into two 

ByTOMVU 
Senior Staff Writer 

It has been three, almost four 
long years for Bill Gates. In 1997 his 
company, Microsoft, was charged 
by the U.S. Department of Justice 
for breaking antitrust laws and 
effectively acting as a monopoly. 

In a shocking May 2000 deci-
sion, Judge Thomas Penfield Jack-
son ordered the breakup of 
Microsoft into two companies. 

According to Jackson, one of the 
two companies would handle the 
operations of the Windows operat-
ing system while the other would 
focus on all other computer appli-
cations. ow, almost an entire year 
later, nothing has been settled as 
the case has reached the U.S. Court 
of Appeals and it may even reach 
the U.S. Supreme Court if there are 
more appeals to follow. 

The government's case against 
the software giant was erroneous 
from the beginning, and its solu-
tions would have had little effect. 
The only reason the ruling went the 
way it did was that the judge was 

..obviously biased against Gates. 
Jack~on, in breaching judicial 

conduct by extensively comment-
ing on the case afterward, com-
pared Gates to apoleon."1 think 
he has a Napoleonic concept of 
himself and his company," Jackson 
stated, "an arrogance that derives 

fro~ power and unalloyed success 

This animosity is evident and 
seems unfit for a person who is 
supposed to be unbiased. It almost 
looks as if the judge has some type 
of vendetta against Gates from the 
way Jackson is insulting him. This 
biased attitude is more than enough 
reason for the seven judges on the 
panel to throw out the case. 

The government's case ... 
was erroneous from the 
beginning, and its 
solutions would have 
had little effect .,. the 
judge was obviously 
biased against Gates. 

The solution offered _ by the 
government, and -accepted by the 
judge, is ineffective in curbing 
Microsoft's dominance or its 
monopolistic envelopment, if one 
even be lieves it to be a monopoly. 
The wisdom behind breaking up 
the company into the proposed 
fashion must be questioned. Right 
now, nearly 90 percent of the 
world 's computers use the Win-
dows operating system. 

Will dividing the company into 
two take Windows off half of that 
90 percent? Would it somehow 
promote people to use other oper-
ating systems? Perhaps yes, but 
definitely not enough to make any 
real difference. 

The government's take on this is 
reminiscent of how it dealt with 
AT&T. The government simply 
broke AT&T into five separate and 

competitive companies. The key 
here is that these companies com-
peted against one another and as 
any economics student knows, 
competition brings down prices; 
thus the monopoly is successfully 
defeated. 
. What makes the case of 
Microsoft different is that the two 
companies would not compete 
against one another. One side 
focuses on the operating system 
while the other handles the com-
puter applications that depend on 
Windows. How will this achieve any 
semblance of competition, especial-
ly in the market for operating sys-
tems in which Windows would still 
dominate? It must be wondered if 
the U.S. Department of Justice even 
knows. 

Another itch the government 
wants scratched is the bundling of 
Microsoft's Web browser, Internet 
Explorer, into Windows. The 
prosecutors' claim that by 
bundling Internet Explorer with 
Windows, deleting the browser 
would cause Windows to run inef-
ficiently, is simply preposterous. 
This may seem elementary, but are 
they not Microsoft's products? 
Shouldn't they be allowed to bun-
dle whatever programs they want? 

If this is the case, then having 
"Minesweeper" preinstalled in 
Windows would infringe on 
antitrust laws, as it prohibits people 
from playing "Counter Strike: By

Service: 
Volunteer work exposes 
people to diversity 
contiNi'" froID ...... 
those who give it. A major benefit is 
job experience. 

Volunteering is much like 
employment of any other sort: [t 
entails regular hours, answering to 
a supervisor, completing necessary 
tasks and cooperating with others. 
Volunteering at a women's shelter 
provides more useful work experi-
ence than flipping greasy burgers 
and soaking potato snips in animal 
fat. 

Revelle junior Nick Parziale is 
co-director of UCSD's Eyes on 
the Elderly program, in which stu-
dents make regular nips to the 
Torrey Pines Convalescent Home 
to interact with seniors who may 
have little contact with their fami-
ly. 

Parziale explained that his expe-
riences with Eyes on the Elderly 
have taught him "interpersonal and 
leadership skills" and have given 
him a satisfaction in his accom-
plishments that translates into con-
fidence. Clearly, community service 
opportunities offer students valu-
able tools for success in the work 
world. 

Perhaps less tangible yet infi-
nitely more significant than gaining 
a foothold in the job market is the 
exposure to other cultures that vol-
unteering provides. 

Racial diversity on college cam-
puses has been the source of much 
controversy in recent years; howev-
er, few question the value of being 
exposed to a diverse environment. 
This can be achieved through 
means other than the thorny issue 
of affirmative action. 

A middle-class volunteer who 
works in an inner city school will 
be immersed in an environment 
different from the one she was 

raised in, and will develop a more 
balanced perspective on impor-
tant issues such as discrimination 
and education. 

Parziale described a friendship 
he had with a woman through 
Eyes on the Elderly. 

"She was one of the nicest ladies 
I've ever met: he recalled. "Her life 
was different from my own in every 
aspect, and I learned so much from 
her." His relationship taught him 
about a different life experience. 

University of North Carolina 
graduate Ajay Ojha volunteered 
with Americorps, a national public 
service organization that boasts 
impressive enrollment. 

She said of her service, "Being 
a part of such a diverse team 

Perhaps less tangible

volunteering provides ...

two people are alike. and as obvi-
ous as that sounds, many people 
never realize ilJ'N wonderful this 
really is ... eventually, a little bit of 
everyone you meet begins to rub 
off on you: 

Experience with different social 
and ethnic groups therefore can 
improve volunteers' lives and bener 
prepare them for the diversity they 
will encounter later in life. 

Many balk at the idea of requir-
ing community service. They call 
this "involuntary volunterrism" 
and cite the eff0rts of wdl-inten-

The UCSD Guardian 

tioned officials who sign off on vol-
unteer hours not completed in 
order to allow students to meet 
their requirements. However, such 
violations of policy, while serious. 
should not deter such a beneficial 
plan from going forward. 

Also, many reason that if stu-
dents do not want to volunteer, 
they will "drag their feet: and do a 
shoddy job in order to simply get 
the service over and return to class 
as normal. If student unwillingness 
were a just deterrent, itJoUows that 
we'd have no general education 
requirements at universities. 

Literature majors hate being 
forced into math classes. and the 
engineering folks complain about 
the obligatory humanities courses. 
In these cases. however, it has been 
decided that the benefit of these 
requirements outweigh students' 
individual displeasure. It should be 
the same with community service. 

Marty also point out that some 
students must work a paying job 
in order to finance college and pay 
for living expenses. In cases of 
dramatic financial need, some vol-
unteer service could be reduced. 
In addition, college fees would be 
subsidized for volunteerism, 
much like in the Americorps pro-
gram, which offers almost $5,000 
in grants or loan forgiveness In 
exchange for a year of service. 

Volunteerism is a feasible way 
to .address the social problems 
facing us in America. College stu-
dents are graced with intelligence 
and understanding. They can 
benefit immensely from their 
experiences in community service 
and can strengthen society at 
large. 

[t is not enough to go out into 
the world armed only with a 
diploma and a head full of quota-
tions and equations; to succeed, 
students must feel confident and 
capable and feel satisfied. that they 
are connibuting to improving the 
community.

And what exactly is a "tempo-

argued that in the new economy, 
technology such as software 
requires huge fixed costs but trivial 
marginal costs. This allows a firm 
to monopolize a sector once it can 
get past the fixed costs. The trivial 
marginal costs allows for a unique

vous would you be speaking in front of the

qualities for a leader. 

One excellent demonstration of this fact

is able to, while monotonously, articulate 
himself bener than our president. Yet his poli-

govern. His energy pl~n created ~n energy cri-

the time to read the Constitution, you would 
realize that it is not there. (This idea of the 
separation of church and state actually came 
from an 1802 lener from Thomas jefferson to 
the Danbury Baptist Association, but is NOT 
in the Constitution). 

Do the conservatives on our campus need 
to write a letter to the editor every week citing 
Bush's many accomplishments? Being the 
first President with an MBA. graduating from 
Harvard and Yale. and servin$ as Governor of 
Texas are aU proof that he IS intelligent. A 
more warranted assault would be on our gov-
ernor and his failing power policies, but liber-
als have shown us in the past and continue to 
show us now that they stand by their "lead-
ers' no matter how immoral (Bill Clinton and 
Ted Kennedy) or incapable (Gray Davis).

AdYIce: Dr. Drew and Adam Corolla, from the popular radio and t£levision program, Love/ine, entertained 
students and others Tuesday night at the Prio: Center Theater.

ContInued from ..... 1 
and enjoying college life to their well-known 
advice on drugs and sex. In addition, the two 
responded to one student's question about 
the recent shootings at Santana High School. 
Corolla said he did not see how anyone could 
make sense out of such a senseless act. 

Drew offered advice to students on how 
to deal with the common questions that 
arise about finding a career. 

"You should follow your instincts and 
that the money will come if you w.ork hard," 
Drew said. 

Corolla added to this sentiment. saying 
how a person should love what he docs for 
a living. regardless of the money he makes. 

"I thought Adam was hilarious." said 
Revelle senior Jill Donofrio. ult was darn 
good fun ."

ContInued from ..... 1 
University. He was the medical school's first 
dean of admissions, education and student 
affairs. He established much of the curricu-
lum and criteria for admission . 

Simon created a class for the second-
year medical students called "Fundamentals 
of Medical Spanish." 

This class allows for future doctors to 
work side-by-side with Spanish speaking 
doctors. The studen ts learn basic Spanish 
to converse in the medical world . The class 
is extremely popular and is the first of its 
kind in the country. 

Simon is: currently co-teaching an 
undergraduate seminar titled "Elements of 
International Health ." 

Colleague and Associate Professor 
Richard Kronick said he was elated upon 
hearing of Simon's honor. 

"Simon has had a distinguished career," 
Kronick said. "We are very pleased that we 
received a contribution in his name. He 
helped grow the UCSD Medical School 
into the distinguished institution that it is 
today." 

Kronick is the chair of the search com-
mittee for the endowed chair. He and oth-
ers have been bringing in a team of experts 
to educate themselves on the field and to 
create a suitable job description . Kronick 
also evoked Simon's work in the faculty and 

the event, described how the A.S. Council 
booked Corolla and Drew for the event. 

"At first we were thinking of getting only 
Drew; Bajaj said. "Eventually though, we 
were able to get Adam and decided to sell it 
as "Loveline." 

According to Bajaj. talk began last quar-
ter of booking Drew. Bajaj said that Drew's 
agent mentioned that Corolla would also be 
available to make the short commute from 
Los Angeles to San Diego. 

"Loveline" was originally to take place at 
RIMAC Arena but was moved to the Price 
Center Theater after the latter venue 
became available. Bajaj said. He welcomed 
the change because the new location pro-
vided a more intimate setting than RIMAC 
Arena. 

"Honestly, I think it was better because it 
was more appropriate for the personal 
nature of the show." 

After leaving the show. Revelle senior Joe 
Lake said he enjoyed the show immensely. 

ult was dope like a muffin; Lake said. "I 
didn't know that Dr. Drew was so willing to 
bag on Adam, but their chemistry made it all 
the more entertaining." 

staff health care package. 
"He has worked to keep the benefits 

high and the costs low; Kronick said. 
Simon also expressed excitement at the 

election of a new chair. 
"I hope to work with the new chair; 

Simon said. 
The naming of the endowed chair 

comes as a change in the status quo. 
"Chairs are often named for the donor 

who gives the money." said Director of 
Health Sciences Communications Leslie 
Franz. "In this case, the honor goes to 
another individual. It shows the amount of 
esteem held for the work of Simon." 

Simon has worked on issues such as 
infectious diseases. physical and psycholog-
ical trauma experienced by refugees, popu-
lation growth, malnutrition and health care 
resources. 

Simon has written eight books and over 
130 articles in scientific journals. He is a 
fellow in many international societies, 
including the American College of 
Physicians, the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science, the Royal 
Society of Medicine, the American College 
of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. 
and the American Public Health 
Association . 

Simon was born in Karlsruhe, Germany 
and came to the United States in 1938. He 
got his premedical undergraduate degree at 
UC Berkeley and received his doctorate at 
Harvard Medical School. He joined the fac-
ulty of Stanford University School of 
Medicine in 1959 before coming to San 
Diego in 1966.

and surreal moment . 

As the photographer and L entered his

We sat on a small wooden bench, facing what 
appeared to be a shrine-It was decorated with

Lamas, a ceremonial Tengu mask and a brass

of his biography and remembered there was 
no such thing as a -quick" look into such a 
nefarious life, to use his own word. 

Phelps was orphaned at birth and spent 
his childhood bouncing from foster home to 
foster home. He eventually settled in Hawaii 
and was taken in as a ward by a village of 
aS~OIted Chinese, Japanese and native Hawai-
ians. They became his surrogate parents and 
helped him survive childhood polio at the age 
of4. 

"The Hawaiians would massage me with 
their Lomi Lomi massage: Phelps said. 
"Uncle David would show me some of his 
private arts, and the Japanese would massa~e 
me with their martial arts, and then the ChI-
nese taught me Tai Chi and Qi Gong prac-
tices."

Temple: 
Martial artist waits six 
days at temple's gate 
Continued from page 9 

It was here lhat Phelps began 
his Journey with the martial arts. 

"Back then, all the kids in the 
vtll<lgr wantcd 10 be American and 
cal French fnes, and ran away from 
their culture," Phelps said. "B ut I 
\\',IS ,I strange kid, and I was a cap-
!Ive audience. So I listened to the 
cIders. I didn't have any friends my 
own age. They began to teach me 
II hat they couldn't teach their own 
grandchildren." 

And by default, the orphaned 
Phelps had become a martial artist. 

Phelps was not treated to a warm 
i1umecoming. 

"They weren't very nice when 
we arrived: Phelps said, "calling us 
names while all we could think of 
was, 'Where were you while our 
buddies' heads were getting blown 
off?' So I said, 'The heck with that: 
and went back to where I was hap-
picr: in Asia. Specifically, I went to 
Hong Kong tJ find agung fu mas-
ter." 

While in Hong Kong, Phelps 
was introduced to Dr. Chin, who 
knew of a Buddhist monastery in 
the Northern territories of China 
that was open to teaching Western-
ers. !I. letter of recommendation 
was written and Phelps waited out-
side the monastery for six days. 
until he was invited in on the sev-

enth day. Not only did 
such training con-
dItion his body, he 
began to think in 
the traditio nal 
sense of his elders. 
This caused greater 
alienation between 
Phelps and the 
world at hand, as 
he bore the face of 
a "howa" (Cau-
casian) , but bran-
dished an Eastern 
soul. 

"I looked like 
them, but I didn 't 
thll1k like them." 
he said. 

While in Hong 
Kong, Master 
Phelps. was 
introduced to Dr. 
Chin, who knew of 
a Buddhist 
monastery in the 
northern territories 
of China that was 
open to teaching 
Westerners, 

"They took me 
in and lead me to 
this small altar: he 
said. "After some 
chatting [Phelps 
became fluent in 
Mandarin Chinese 
while in China[. 
they offered me a 
cup of tea. I was 
told earlier that I 
should offer the 
first cup to the 
altar. If they offered 
me a second cup, it 
would mean my 
acceptance into the 
monastery. 

Phelps devel-
oped his martial arts training in its 
most practical form in the Vietnam 
War as a special forces operative. 
He then spent the next seven years 
both as an enlisted soldier and an 
officer in the elite Navy SEALs. 
Phelps then became an officer for 
the U peacekeeping forces in the 
Golan Heights, Syria and Southern 
Lebanon, later working as a case 
officer for the CIA's counter- terror-
Ist task force Not only did his 
tr.llnll1g mcnt,llIy discipline him to 
h,lIldlt: the gcneral rigors of mili-
1,1i,' lite, It pr(,pared him for actual 
hfc-,lIld-death sccnanos. 

"There \\crt' tllnes when you'd 
be alunc ~nd all you knew was that 
you were surrounded by enemies," 
Phelps said. "My martial arts train-
ing gave me that edge - to feel my 
encmles without seeing them." 

Along with combat, thc arts had 
gll'en him the meditative resources 
to calm himself, or to be as calm as 
thc target of bullets and brimstone 
could possibly be. 

"If another cup 
wasn 't offered, the person was 
expected to make up an excuse and 
leave the monastery - that way, no 
face was lost: he said. 
. Phelps was offered a second cup 
and was allowed into the 
monastery as a student, where he 
became a pupil under Wen Shih, 
master of the "Dai Lao Hu Gung 
Fu: or "Grand Tiger System." The 
Grand Tiger is the symbol of the 
West in ancient Chinese cosmolo-
gy. Feared and revered by Bud-
dhists and Taoists alike, the Grand 
Tiger is a sentinel, protecting 111110-
cent beings from "Evil's winds." His 
time in the monastery not only 
taught him the physical forms of 
the art, but the intrinsic, esoteric 
value as well . something that has 
been lost with Western commer-
cialization. 

Phelps returned to the United 
States, where he decided to pursue 
his academic interests, receiving a 
bachelor's degree in Chinese phi-

Dave Matthews Band Shows Their New World 
The Guardian reviews the band's latest release 'Everyday' with a track by track listing 
IJJOUPHLD 
Hiatus Editor 

Four years have passed since the 
Dave Matthews Band released their 
last studio album. After filling in 
the time with two live albums, an 
interview album and a popular 
acoustic tour with Tim Reynolds, 
the Dave Matthews Band have 
finally released, ~Everyday." 

"Under The Table & Dreaming" 
was the first major release that intro-
duced Dave and his band to the rest 
of the world. "Crash" was released in 

_1996, and by then the entire world 
was familiar with the eclectic 
acoustic guitar sound, Matthews' 
smooth and ~ vocals and the live-
ly sounds of the: rest of the band. 

In 1998. with "Before These 
Crowded Streets: the Dave 
Matthews Band began to explore 
new ground with their sound by 
including a gospel choir and exper-
imenting more with their melodies 

- and their sound. But they remained 
distinctively Dave Matthews songs. 

Their recent release of "Every-
day" -continues to show the pro-
gression of the Dave Matthews 
Band and the evolution of their 
sound. The album may be difficult 
to listen to at first because it does-
n't have the obviously catchy tunes 
found in previous songs like "Ants 
Marching" and "Crash.N

The chord progressions are more 
complex and the mdodies are a bit 
more difficult to find. Much of the 
pop edge has been wiped away and it 
reveals a much broader sound that 
requires a little patience. 

Carter Beauford's drums have 
not changed much; they are one of 
the most varied and eclectic of any 
drummer in music today. Bass 
player Stefan Lessard is the 
youngest member of the band. but 
he has developed into quite a tal-
ented bass player. There is even a 
touch of keyboard in many of the 
tracks 

Saxophone: player Leroi Moore 
and violinist Boyd Tinsley have 
been pushed to new musical levels. 
Moore adds the flute and the con-
tra-bass clarinet to his usual duties 
on the baritone. alto and tenor sax. 
Tinsley actually used a wah-wah 
pedal-to push the tones on his vio-
lin to new heights. Tinsley even 
offers his vocal talents on various 
songs. especially on "[ Did It." 

The most obvious change in the 
latest evolution of the Dave 
Matthews Band sound is the use of 
electric guitars by Matthews. The 
lush acoustic sound has been slow-
ly replaced by the rough ed$e of 
electric guitars and even a ban tone 
guitar on several tracks. 

Here is a track-by-track listing 
of the new album by the Dave 

Matthews Band: 

Every song on "EVERYDAY" 

"I Did It" 
This song has been getting a lot 

of radio play and is heavily bass-
driven . "I Did It" sets the tone for 
the rest of the album with its th ick 
bass line and guitars. The chorus 
has a melody that is vaguely remi-
niscent of Aerosmith, and Tinsley 
drops a little spoken-word element 
into the middle of the track. 

"When the World Ends" 
This track also follows the pat-

tern of a thick bass line. There is def-
initely a smooth groove to the song, 
but it seems to follow the same for-
mula and flavor of "I Did It.N 

"The Space Between" 
The electric guitar is very appar-

ent in the first few seconds of this 
track. It is distinctly different from 
the acoustic ballads of previous 
Dave Matthews songs. The chorus 
has some Toto-esque elements 
with cascading and atmospheric 
guitar riffs. 

"Dreams of Our Fathers" 
With the first three notes you 

automatically think "Satellite: but 
with the pace of and vocal complex-
ity of "Too Much." There is also a

Police-like feel to the guitar part. 

"So Right" 
A funky guitar jam opens up 

this track and it can be the perfect 
song to cruise down the city streets 
with the top down. The vocals are 
strong and soaring, but the lyrics a 
bit too simplified. 

"If I Had It All" 
The acoustic guitar makes its 

first appearance in the early 
moments of the track, but then 
returns to the heavy bassline. 

"What You Are" 
Riverdance comes to mind with 

the string arrangements in this 
song. But the song offers a lot of 
beautiful harmonies and dark 
undertones in the chorus. 

"Angel" 
A soft saxophone drives this 

entire' song. "Angel" stands as one 
of the strongest tracks on the 
album, with a relaxing beat and 
vintage Dave Matthews singing; 
the kind that makes you swoon. 

"Fool To Think" 
There is a blatant "Message in a 

Bottle" vibe to this song. It seems 
as if the band took the first notes 
on the guitar riff of the famous 
Police song. Even the drum beats 

and the rim shots are straight from 
the Police school of thought. 

"Sleep to Dream Her" 
Dave Matthews' sultry vocals are 

prominent in this song, which is 
backed by weeping strings and a soft 
syncopated, almost ska-like guitar 
part. Then it gives way to a theatrical 
string arrangement and showcases 
the plaintive saxophone of Moore. 

"Mother Father" 
This song features Carlos San-

tana and percussionist Karl Perra-
zoo The lovely Spanish guitar softly 
picks in the background with San-
tana 's trademark electric guitar. 
There is a definitely a Latin flavor 
to this song that makes for a solid 
song and a future radio hit. 

"Everyday" 
The uplifting title track has the 

support of the gospel choir sound, 
which was introduced in "Before 
These Crowded Streets." This is 
much lighter than the rest of the 
album and it returns to the classic 
acoustic guitar sound. It's a song 
that makes you glad that you were 
patient enough to listen to the 
entire album. 

Once you're done, try the album 
again and you'll find that these 
tracks really grow on you.

'emple: 
Sensei Phelp enters the 
Episcopal priesthood 
ContInued front .... 10 
losophy from Stanford University. 
He received his master's degree in 
comparative religion from Harvard 
University, where his theological 
studies were under renowned pro-
fessors Richard Reinhold and John 
Carmen. Phelps also studied at the 
Harvard Yenching Institute of East 
Asian Studies with Chinese 
philosopher Tu Weiming. He con-
cluded his academic . endeavors 
with a master's of divinity from Yale 
Divinity School and was ordained 
as an Episcopal priest in 1993, 
serving in the Episcopal Diocese of 
San Diego. Yes - he's also a priest. 

"People have a hard time relat-
ing why someone devoted to mar-
tial ans would pursue religion in 
such a manner," Phelps said. "1 
have a hard time understanding 
why they can't see the simi larities." 

During his stay at Stanford , 
Phelps continued his martial arts 
training under Mark Saito. Shorin-
jin Ryu Saito Ninjitsll is a Japanese 
family martial art that emphasizes 
discipline a nd anonymity. He is one 
of only three people who hold the 
rank of 10th-degree black belt in 
Saito Ninjitsu. He is the only non-
Saito throughout the martial art's 
illustrious 1 ,OOO-year history to be 
granted the rank of Saito Ninjitsu 
Master. 

Along with his mastery of Saito 
Ninjitsu, Phelps became an autho-
rized instructor of the Fu family 
Wudang arts in China. Privately 
tutored under Bo Sim Mark, 
founder of the Chinese Wushu 
Research Center, Phelps is the only 
person authorized to teach the art 
in the United States. 

What resulted after a lifetime of 
training and searching for the mar-
tial way, whatever that may be, 
Phelps integrated his training into 
his own unique martial style. Wu 
Shan Fa, or "Five Mountains," is a 
system that utilizes elements from 
Dai Lao Hu Gung Fu, Wu Dang 
Ssu, Shorinjin Ryu Saito Ninjitsu 
and Hawaiian Lua. Each one of 
these arts is taught on its own in 
style and discipline, yet each is 
infused with one another in such a 
way as to make a greater compre-
hensive system. 

Master Phelps subsequently 
named his dojo the Temple of the 
Full Autumn Moon after the same 
monastery in which learned the 
Dai Lao Hu Gung Fu. After five 
years, his first crop of black belts is 
finally emerging. Of course, in the 
martial arts community, receiving a 
black belt is just the beginning. 

Part two of this feature will 
include the actual interview, as well 
as the master's personal thoughts 
on defining the martial arts and 
their role in the future . . 

For more information on the 
Temple of the Full Autumn Moon,

Polo Pounds Pathetic Peons 
Women down La Verne and Bakersfield by combined 31·4 

Associate Sports Editor 

The Thtons took to the pool Sunday morn-
ing with a long day ahead of them. At the end 
of the day, though, there were nothing but 
smiles gracing the faces of the women's water 
polo team. 

UCSD was slated to playa mixed double-
header, with a game against California State 
University Bakersfield in the morning, and one 
against University of La Verne for the night-
cap. The Tritons showed up ready to tackle the 
challenge and came away with a pair of victo-
ries. 

The CSU Bakersfield game was a thorough 
shellacking, as the Tritons roared out to a 9-0 
halftime lead. They then built on this domi-
nating lead, adding eight more in the second 
half while allowing only two to post the 17-2 
victory. 

The whipping was led by Samare Silver-
man, who found the back of the cage a whop-
ping five times in the match. Erin Welsh con-
tributed a hat trick, while Daniellc Boyle had a 
pair. Seven other Tritons had individual tallies. 

T1ie Thtons kept their offensive guns blaz-
ing in the second game, this time compiling a 

-'7-1 lead by the time the whistle sounded to 
signal the end of the first half. No mercy was 
shown in the second half ei ther, as the nitons 
continued to pour it on with a vengeance. 

Women:

Blemker steps it up for the Tritons 
ContInued from ...,. H 
sophomore Amber Hopkins leading the way. 
The varsity team kept the race close, but it was 
.evident that it had lost within the first quarter 
of the race. It never seemed to have enough gas 
to make a charge at the front. 

"They are further along in their speed-
work; said head coach Pattie Pinkerton. "We 
never really pra"iced tha t in our practices, but 
I was proud of the way my girls swam. Our 
hope is to catch them at the end of the season, 
and we have a good chance to do so as the sea-
son moves along as our speed increases." 

The Long Beach match provided the lift 
that women'~ crew needed to get back on track. 
The three teams swept the swims, dominating 
from the get-go. Last year the team from Long 
Beach swept all the races, so the Thtons must 
be proud to rebound from that loss. 

"It was great getting a victory against Long 
Beach and evening our record," Pinkerton 
said. "We are still in the early stages of prepa-
ration, and as we continue to progress in the 
season, we will develop a high stroke rate 

Gulls:

with the best of them 
ConIIIIHd from ...,. 1. 
sporting event. 

As if the exciting on-ice antics of the stick-
wielding playas were not enough, the Gulls 
management has tossed a bunch of other 
wacky ingredients into the mix, such as the 
cannon mobile, which circles the ice between 
periods, firing T-shirts and other souvenirs into 
the stands with an almost frightening velocity. 

Dana Thcker, Hillary Smith, Renae Coulter, 
Danielle Bourret, Elena Tellechea and Silver-
man all knocked down two goals apiece in the 
drubbing. 

When the smoke cleared, and the poor, 
beaten La Verne players were dragged from the 
pool, the scoreboard reflected the Tritons' polo 
prowess, glowing with the 14-2 final score. 

There are few more enjoyable ways to 
spend a blustery Sunday than by outscoring 
your opponents by a 31-4 margin. The Tritons' 
destruction of their opponents was made even 
more sweet by the fact that it pushed the 12th-
ranked club's record above the .SOO mark, at 
7-6. 

UCSD will look to keep this trend alive as 
it faces off against Villanova University here at 
Canyonview Pool at 6 p.m. On Friday the bat-
tle for San Diego supremacy goes down as the 
dreaded SDSU Aztecs invade our campus 
looking to upend our beloved Tritons. 

Bad blood is already boiling between the 
two teams following two particularly gritty 
prior meetings between the clubs. This battle 
will be another 6 p.m. start at Canyonview Pool. 

Following these two home matches the Th-
tons will be heading to the LBC to grapple 
with Long Beach State and Claremont College 
in a Saturday doubleheader. It looks to be 
another full weekend, but the Tritons are rid-
ing high and look to be ready to take on all 
challengers. 

against these teams, separating ourselves 
from the rest of the pack. We will meet all 
these teams again in the San Diego Crew 
Classic in early April, so that will show us 
how our development has grown." 

Pinkerton also commented on some star 
crew members in the lightweight division. 
Senior Heather Beckman is the senior of the 
varsity squad and the backbone of the niton 
arsenal. Senior Cari Blemker is also a key for 
the Tritons, as she brings experience and 
good lIthletic ability to the team. 

Senior Julie Snyder again is a force for 
UCSD, holding up the rear of the boat and 
providing sound leadership for the younger 
teammates. Finally, sensational sophomore 
Emily Gray is stepping into the spotlight and 
rowing to her potential. 

As for the goals in the 2001 season, it is evi-
dent from the demeanor of the athletes and 
their confidence in one another that they will 
continue to improve and perform well against 
their rivals at the championships in late April. 

"It is almost cenain that there will be a 
Division II championship next year, so our 
focus is on beating UC Davis to advance far-
ther in the rounds," Pinkerton said. "I don't 
think we are strong enough to defeat them 
this year, but who knows - the girls impress 
me every time." 

There is also the mascot, a feathered fanat-
ic who wanders the stands, bringing laughter 
and merriment to the young and old alike. The 
Gulls Girls also do their part to entertain the 
crowd, dancing and whirling about the arena in 
skimpy yet decorative garments. 

So the next time you and your roommate 
fee l like beating each other with a stick, resist 
at all costs, and instead go watch two highly 
trained professionals beat each other with 
their own sticks. Just pick up a ticket, which, 
starting at $5, is within even your budget, 
purchase a hot dog and a beer (or five) from 
the snack bar and buckle yourself in for some 
rock 'em, sock 'em hockey action .

New Camera, Pleasel 
The Buzz: The Men's AA division had a bulging 60 teams competing in 8 different leagues. The 
schedulers decided to break the division up into an Elite level (which included teams that 
finished t" or 2'" in their league) and a Power level. In this upper level there is nothing but solid

The Buzz: The winner of th is thing will be burned out! Team depth will be a key. In order to win, 
teams will need to cover players thai can't make a game time, injuries and cold shooting. Hope 
Dreams could play with most of the Men's AA teams and they should handle Ihis bunch. Gang 
Bang is the sleeper in the fl8ld, but they play like women. so gelling past the second round 
would be success for them.

Coed A First Round: Sunday 3111 • 5pm; Semis: Tuesday 3/13 @ 8pm; Final Four: Remember 
the Tritons, Cornerstone, Meeha & The Inmates 
The Buzz: No question here. Tt.3 Tritons held their own in a lough league and should have lillie 
trouble with this group. If'they do stumble, look for the Inmales to take over the house. 

Women's First Round: Sunday 3111 @ 2pm; Semis: Tuesday 3113 @ 10pm; Final Four: BBB, All· 
Stars, Oh Crapl & B-8all Queens 
The Buzz: BBB should have no problem with this field. They should keep their eye on the young 
guns of the B·Ball Queens who could wrestle away the top spot. This may be the last roundup 
for the old, slow, tired squads of Shirt Tales and Oh Crap. But. you never know how motivating 
the end of a career can be???

scon BURROUGHS 

I n the classic film "One Flew over the Cuckoo's est," a heady, bOisterous fellow 
(played with a volatile aplomb by a 
young Jack Nicholson) is let loose 
on a static mental ward in some 
nameless, leafy and serene countly 
neighborhood. Once ensconced in 
the tepid environment that is the 
hospital. Nicholson's character 
challenges the establishment's rules 
and structures and all types of bed-
lam ensue. The inmates, embold-
ened by this brash new character, 
make strides of their own, strides 
that probably could not have been 
accomplished without the influence 
of this wild, unrestrained new ele-
ment. 

While I'm fairly sure that there 
are not all that many mentally dis-
abled individuals populating 
UCSD's leafy, serene campus (with 
the exception of those stick-fighting 
ninjas on Library Walk and the bet-
ter part of the A.S. Council), there 
are definitely those among us who 
suffer trom a darker, more debilitat-
ing problem. 

They are the socially disabled 
types who scorn those other, more 
enlightened souls who choose to 
indulge in this or that, and in doing 
so, tend to push the proverbial enve-
lope beyond their discernible hori-
zon . 

A particularly memorable scene 
from "Cuckoo's ~est" is one in 
which ;\!icholson's character smug-
gles III a bunch of booze and a cou-
pIa babes for a debauched in-house 
rager. All the inmates start guzzling 
COpiOUS amounts of booze (includ-
ing the bedndden guy with the 
intravenous hookup) and a wild 
night of reckless abandon is enjoyed 
by all. The inmates who had previ-
ously displayed the cognitive ability 
of a cantaloupe are now laughing 
and carousing like the gin-soaked 
denizens of Hefs Playboy Mansion 
grono. 

Could this be the answer to the 
horrific mental defect that has 
descended upon our campus with 
all the fervor of a locust horde? 
Maybe, or maybe there is something 
more insidious lurking beneath the 
clear-eyed, apathetic veneer of your 
fellow student - something that 
ensures that his social life here at 
UCSD will be void of any semblance 
of enjoyment and will instead be a 
zany, book-fueled riot of the most 
geekish proportions. 

While those of you afflicted with 
this horriffic malady can do nothing 
to help yourselves - do the insane 
actua lly know that they are insane? 
It is up to the rest of us to lend a 
helping hand to these poor souls in 
need. It may not be easy, but the 
Geisel Library wasn't built in a day, 
and a beer here or a shot there will 
only help to spur them on their way 
to a more balanced sanity. 

This weekend offers the perfect 
opportunity to stage this act of 
unparalleled kindness. With the 
myriad of Triton home games hap-
pening this weekend and with fina ls 
in the imminent future. the inmates 
are looking more restless than 
usual. Oh, and if any of you medical 
students have an IV handy ... well, 
you know what to do.

Triton men have trouble against 
Irvine, sweep Long Beach

Last weekend at Mission Bay, UCSD men's 
crew endured a Jekyll-and-Hyde two days, losing 
its second dual meet in five years to UC Irvine, 
then rebounding to sweep Long Beach State Uni-
versity the next day. 

On Saturday the varsity team showed its inex-
perience as its boat came 10 a complete stop at 
one point in its eventual nine-second loss against 
the Anteaters. 

"I felt pretty confident we could go fast against 
Irvine, we just didn't execute fast for a number of 
reasons," said head coach Michael Filippone. 
"Our inexperience showed."

Tennis 
Splits up 
North 
Triton women down 
Sonoma State, have 
trouble against Davis 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team faced two schools to the north 
last weekend. The Tritons easily 
handled Sonoma State 8-1 but fell 
to top-ranked UC Davis, 7-2. 

Sonoma State was ranked third 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Associatic}I1 going into the match, 
while the Tritons were ranked sec-
ond. On paper this looked like a 
good match, but head coach Liz 
LaPlante wasn't fooled . 

"I wasn't surprised at our easy 
win against Sonoma," LaPlante 
said. "We probably lost a few more 
games than we should have, but it 
was very windy and that equalized 
things a linle." 

The match started out well for 
the Tritons, as two of the three dou-
bles teams won their pro sets. Both 
No. 1 and No. 3 doubles won 8-6 
while Melisa Liao and Julie Wester-
man lost 2-8 at No. 2 doubles. 
LaPlante was especially impressed 
with the play of her No. 1 doubles 
team, Lyndsey Tadlock and 
Stephanie Moriarty. 

"The best match was No. 1 dou-
bles with Tadlock and Moriarty," 
LaPlante saia. "They played the 
best they have played together." 

In singles the Tritons continued 
to roll, sweeping all six spots. The 
most interesting match was at NO. 5 
doubles, where Westennan won the 
first set in a tie-breaker but looked 
to have lost her edge in the second 
set, where she lost 1-6. Despite no 
longer having the momentum, 
Westerman fought on and quickly 
took control of the third set and 
went on to win 6-2. 

Riding that wave of emotion, the 
Tritons moved on to UC Davis. 

"We knew they were going to be 
tough," LaPlante said. "I was disap-
pointed with the overall 7-2 loss, 
because the match was actually a lot 
closer than it appears." 

The Tritons got off on the wrong 
foot by losing all three doubles pro 
sets by a score of 4-8. 

"We were out-played in dou-
bles," LaPlante said. "They were a 
lot more aggressive and served and 
returned better." 

Even though the Tritons won 
only two of the six singles matches, 
they had a chance to win three 
more. 

No. 1 singles was never in dou-
ble for the Aggies. Jill Howard 
quickly picked apart O'Neil 6-1, 6-
3. No. 2 singles, however, was a dif-
ferent story. - -

Tadlock had already won the 
first set and had a 5-2 lead. Just 
when she looked like she would 
serve out the match, her opponent 
got hot and reeled off 11 straight 
games to take the match in three 
sets. 

Liao won in straight sets at No. 
3 singles, while her doubles partner, 
Westerman, did 1M same at No. 5. 

Kristina Jansen split the first two 
sets with her opponent at No. 4 sin-
gles but lost in an extended tie-
breaker,losing the match . 

The same thing happened to 
Mary Hung at No. 6 singles. 

The Thtons next face Cal State 
Bakersfield on Saturday at 11 a.m.
