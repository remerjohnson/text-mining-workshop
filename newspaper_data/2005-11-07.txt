Executive 
caught in 

media fray 
By JACLYN SNOW 

Staff Writer 

MauriceJunious is a man tuck in 
the middle. 

On one hand, the A.S. commis-
sioner of student services has ulti-
mate oversight over Student-Run 
Television, a service recently thrust 
into the national spotlight because 
of a debate station managers say 
hinges on free speech rights. 

On the other hand, Junious' 
post requires an obligation to fel-
low councilmembers, most of whom 
have demanded student government 
control over the station. 

While the two issues have been 
far from compatible, Junious' final 
decision took the form of an October 
amendment to the station's charter 
that he drafted prohibiting graphic 
nudity. 

"This is an issue of legitimacy," 
Junious said. "I'm not trying to limit 
anybody. But at the same tUne, the 
[SRTV] charter was an issue and 
I wanted to find a way the charter 
works where things can run respon-
sibly." 

The proposal was a temporary 
fix to an unresolved mess left by last 
year's council,Junious said.

Top UC leader resigns 

amid investigation 
M.R.C. Greenwood resigned 

Nov. 4 as University of California 
provost and senior vice presi-
dent, the second-ranking position 
in the system, amidst investigation 
into potentially illegal hiring pro-
cedures and conflicts of interest, 
according to UC President Robert 
C. Dynes. 

Inquiries by the Son Francisco 
Chronicle spurred both the UC 
General Counsel and the university 
auditor's offices to investigate a 
hiring involving Greenwood, Dynes 
said. 

Greenwood hired Lynda Goff 
as a faculty associate and, more 
recently, as director of the uni-
versity system's Science & Math 
Initiative. However, officials found 
that Greenwood and Goff had 
owned rental property together 
until recently, according to Dynes. 

"It appears that Provost 
Greenwood may have been 
involved in Dr. Goff's hiring to a 
greater extent than was appro-
priate, given that her business 
Investment with Dr. Goff had not 
been properly and fully resolved 
in accordance with conflict of 
interest requirements," Drnes 
stated In a UC press release. This 
In no way reflects on Dr. Goff, her 
credentials, or the terms and con-
ditions of her appointment. This 
involves only the appropriateness 
of Provost Greenwood's role in 
her hiring." 

Also under investigation is the 
hiring of Greenwood's son, James 
Greenwood, who last August was 
employed by UC Merced as a 
paid senior intern. UC officials are 
questioning whether or not UC 
Vice PreSident for Student Affairs 
Winston Doby used improper prac-
tices to obtain the position of 
James Greenwood. 

Currently, Doby has been 
placed on paid investigatory leave 
until the inquiry's 'completion, 
Dynes stated. 

"Let me stress there is no pre-
sumption of wrongdoing, and that 
the university expects to complete 
its review of these matters shortly: 
he stated In the release. 

While Provost Greenwood, a 
former chancellor at UC Santa 
Cruz, has offered full cooperation 
with the investigation, she request-
ed that Dynes allow her to quit 
her position to 'return to her aca-
demic pursuits in the university: 
Dynes stated. In addition, Dynes 
temporarily appointed Executive 
Vice Provost and Vice President for 
Academic and Health Affairs Wyatt 
R. Hume to fill Greenwood's and 
Doby's respective positions. 

Theater program to 
innovate sound 

UCSD's top-ranked theater pro-
gram is moving toward another 
innovation, this time in sound 
design. 

Conventionally used as a sup-
porting tool, such as thunderclaps, 

sound design is the focus of a new 
program, Which concentrates on 
realms of both artistic and techno-
logical improvements, according to 
a university press release. 

Through the theater depart-
ment's lies with the California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology, grad-
uate sound design students will 
be allowed access to advanced 
computer and audio technology, 
according to department Chair 
Charlie Oates. 

In the approximately three-year 
program, students will work on 
four or five productions, including 
at least one guaranteed profes-
sional stint as an assistant sound 
designer at the La Jolla Playhouse, 
Oates said. 

The program, launching fall 
2006, will be headed by composer, 
sound designer and UCSD assis-
tant theater professor Shahrokh 
Yadegari. 

Technology currently in devel-
opment will herald a new age of 
theater sound, Yadegari stated in a 
press release. 

"Once you redefine sound 
design this way, it becomes an 
environment for the text to come 
alive in and be a vital part of a 
play,· Yadegari stated. 

Yadegan is cu rrently looking for 
students to be involved, and said 
the new sound design program is 
looking for candidates with eclectic 
backgrounds of theater, composi-
tion and electronic music. 

While cutting-edge technology 
will be a major toor. the program 
will emphasize creative progress, 
Yadegan stated. 

"Students will learn sophisti-
cated computing skills in this pro-
gram: he stated. "But the focus of 
their training will be towards their 
growth as artists." 

Researchers find 
malaria weakness 
UCSD researchers have found 

a unique difference between the 
single-celled parasite that causes 
malaria and more complex organ-
isms. 

Specifically, the malaria strain, 
which accounts for about 1 mil-
lion deaths each year, contains a 
different protein "wiring' that sets 
it apart from the cellular makeup 
of other organisms, according to a 
university press release. 

"The demonstration that the 
Plasmodium protein network dif-
fers significantly from those of 
several model organisms is an 
intriguing result that could lead 
to the identification of novel drug 
targets for fighting malaria: stated 
John Whitmarsh, acting director of 
UCSD's Center for Bioinformatics 
and Computational Biology, in a 
press release. 

The study was authored by Trey 
Ideker, a professor of bioengineer-
ing at UCSD's Jacobs School of 
Engineering. UCSD bioinformatics 
Ph.D. candidate Silpa Suthram and 
Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
medical student research fellow 
Taylor Sittler.

Legal: University attorney 
condones all council actions 

continued from page I 
the Student Press Law Center. 

" I would certainly argue that 
censorship of the show's content 
was not within the legal rights of 
the council," Goodman said. "A 
ban on nudity is clearly a viola-
tion of both statc law and the U.S. 
Constitution. " 

(;Qodman cited a 1973 Supreme 
Court ruling in Papish v. Board of 
Curators of the Univurity of Missullri 
as precedent for the censorship issue, 
which stllted that "state colleges 
and universities are not enclaves 
inunune from the sweep of the First 
Amendment." 

"The court ruled that conven-
tions of decency can never alone 
be justification to ccnsor stu-
dent expression," he said. "Lega l 
obscenity would not be pro-
tected by the First Amendment. 
However. this material was not 
legally obscene." 

According to Park, the council's 
oversight of subject matter is accept-
able because SR1V is a "nonpublic 
forum" to which the A.S. Council has 
always maintained content rights. 

However, the 1995 case of 
Rosenberger v. ReeffIT' and Visitor'S of 
the University of Virginia ruled that 
the use of public university srudent 
activity fees constituted a limited 
public forum, because student gov-
ernments relied on "the power of the 
state to compel a student to pay." As 
governmental bodies, student coun-
cils could regulate time, place and 
matter of distribution. but could not 
discriminate based on content, the 
Supreme Court ruled. 

Regarding York and "Koala 
T\T" being banned from the sta-
tion, Goodman maintains that the 
A.S. Council lacl~s the legal right 
to detennine who and what can be 
broadcast on the station.

"It's ludicrous," Goodman said. 
"There's nothing stopping the A.s. 
Council from banning everyone who 
criticizes them, if they feel they have 
that right." 

For Park, however. prohibiting 
York and his constituents is a more 
straightfolWard matter. 

"[A.S.) is entitled to create rules," 
Park said. "Steve York intentionally 
broL:.e those rules. There are conse-
quences, and those were the conse-
quences. It's highly appropriate for 
[the council] to impose them." 

Even though campus counsel is 
advising the A.S. Council and is 
affiliated with the university admin-
istration, there is no conflicr.of inter-
est, Park said. 

"1 have acted merely in an advi-
sory role," Park said. "All of the 
council's decisions have been there 
own, so there are no clashing inter-
ests there." 

Calling the consequences a fonn 
of censorship, Earl Warren College 
senior Daniel Watts has filed a griev-
ance with the campuswide judicial 
board after his program "Perfect 
Vision" was shut down Nov. 3. 

"1 think they shut it down because 
T was speaking out against [A.S. Vice 
President Finance] Greg Murphy 
and A.S.," Watts said. 

Both Watts and YorL:. have filed 
grievances against the council in the 
hopes of having the pornography 
ban declared a violation of the U.S. 
Constitution. 

"I'm asking for a remporny stay 
to L:.eep A.S. from interfering with 
the production of SRlV," WattS 
said. "They unilaterally made these 
decisions without meeting with 
SRTV to amend their charter. They 
can't do that."

was solved," he said. "We needed 
time to fix the charter. and my 
amendment gave us that time." 

Considering the situation. 
Junious is doing a good job deal-
ing with a problem that has been 
growing since last year, accord-
ing to A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten. 

"I think compared to last year 
... Maurice is doing an appropri-
ate job in how he's handling the 
matter," Sweeten said. "Last year, 
I think student services wanted to 
do things more appropriately and 
more quicldy in response, whereas 
Maurice wants to do thinb'S at more 
business pace ... allowing things to 
come up and be processed on and 
so forth." 

Junious' proposed ban on nudi-
ty was indefinitely tabled until John 
Muir College senior Steve York 
showed a second pornographic 
film on SRTV last month. Three 
days later, Junious' amendment 
was passed. The decision did not 
follow the media grievance pro-
cess, created by Maleki. which was 
designed to "allow students to have 
their grievances when they had a 
problem with the media," Maleki 
said. 

The council's decision not to 
address his broadcasts through the 
grievance process was illegitimate, 
according to York. 

"There was no meeting over the 
first [pornography), there was no 
agreement or anything or stuff filed 
against the first one," York said. 
"They should have gone through 
grievance procedure. You can't just 
jump to a conclusion liL:.e that [and) 
maKe a falc.e amendment." 

But for junious, the media 
grievance procedure is meant to be 
used as a "reactive process," which 
would not have solved problems 
with the flawed charter. 

la" UNIVERSITY CEl:JL~!~ 

"[The amendment] was front-
end protection so that we would 
not have to pull the plug on SRTV, 
and [so that we could] have time 
to worL:. with the charter," JWlious 
said. "It might have seemed really 
stupid at the tillle to just have that 
amendment out of nowhere, and I 
thinL:. that's why it got voted down 
at first, because councilmembcrs 
didn't really understand why it was 
there." 

York's ubsequent airing of por-
nography forced council members 
to realize the importance of buy-
ing time to fix the charter, Junious 
said. 

"I think people started realiz-
ing. 'Oh, that's why we needed the 
amendment there .... Junious said. 
"Pornography would happen in 
between the time that we're work-
ing with SRTV to fix the charter." 

However. there are problems 
with the wording of Junious' 
amendment, which bans "graphic 
depictions of sexual activity involv-
ing nudity," according to SRTV 
co-Manager Tiffany Rapp. 

"I think something more spe-
cific needs to be drafted ... Graphic 
sex [andl nudity are vague terms," 
Rapp said. "It might limit a lot of 
artistic freedom. " 

Junious is now acting as the 
enforcer of those limitations, 
after the council approved a bill 
that placed the power of keep-
ing "Koala TV' members away 
from SRTV into his hands. The 
bill, Junious said, goes a long way 
toward diminishing the power of 
SR1V student managers. but puts 
the commissioner position where it 
belongs: in the middle of the fray. 

"J need to be accountable," he 
said. "J understand how difficult it 
is for the SRTV managers. If our 
decisions as a council or as a service 
are wrong or right, [the blame] 
should be on me and not them." 

Billy Wong/Guardian 
Middle man: Commissioner of Student 
SelVices Maurice Junious tells his side. 

ButJunious' decisions have cre-
ated a gap between him and his 
own service, according to Rapp. 

" I don't know if he's been help-
ful. but I think he 's concerned 
about SRTV," Rapp sa id. " ll c's 
oying to make a olution to Illzke 
everyone happy." 

Because the station defied the 
council 's authority, Junious said 
he was forced into a last resort -
shutting down SRTV indefinitely. 

"I could be there all weekend 
or someone from A.S. could be 
there all weekend to enforce the

Popular ignorance of the First Amendment laid bare 
in dispute over racy photos of San Diego student 

By NATASHA NARAGH. 
Staff Writer 

S cmin ude photos, a lim it- test-ing high school literary maga-zi ne, an underage high-school 
model, angry paren ts and a $1.5 
million defamation claim again t 
the school district. It all sounds like 
the ingredients for Hollywood's 
next blockbuster. Ln reality, howev-
er, the claim is a frivolous attack on 
the freedom of the press that should 
never milke it to the courtroom. 

Monterey Sa lka, a student at 
Torrey Pines High School in Del 
Mar, originally appeared to be an 
advocate for srudents' right to free-
dom of speech when she appeared 
seminude with two other students 
in the school literary magazine, 
Free Flight, in June 2005. Now 
her suit against the dismct attacks 
the very freedom that allowed the 
magazine to be published in the 
first place. 

Salka's $1 .5 million claim 
($500,000 of which her parents are 
seeking) against the San Dieguito 
Union Iligh School District argues 
that she deserves compensation 
for "defamation , invasion of pri-
vacy, inadequate supervision , sexual 
harassment and rclatcd damages all 
slcmming from unauthorized nude 
photographs," as reported by the 

tudent Press Law Center. 
Sa lka's dechJration tbat the 

photos were enti rely unauthor-
ized make it seem as if she were 
held againsl her will and forced 
to pose in photo she did not 
approve. However, this i simply 
not true. Salka freely exerciscd her 
First Amendment right to take 
part in a publication encouraging 
student expression . According to 
the SIlII Diego UlIion-7hlnme, her 
parents knew of the photo shoot 
and a.ssumed the photos would be 
appropriate to their particular stan-
dards without ever questioning the 
school or the publication's adviser 
about the nature of the photo-

graphs. 
Furthermore, the photognlphs 

were not nude, nor intended as 
ob cm e. The IO-page spread , a 
commentary on the human form, 
features photos of the three models 
holding blank canvases and wood-
en frames in front of a 
white backdrop. No pri-
vate parts were shown, as 
the models were 

taken as a whole, appeals to the 
prurient interesl; the work [must 
depict or describe] in a patently 
offensive way, sexual conduct spe-
cifically defin ed by the applicable 
state law," and "the work, taken as 
a whole, [must lack] serious literary,

skin -col-
ored tank 
tops and 
underwear 
or covered 
by blank 
canvases. 
In Salka's 
photo, she 
i not fully 
clothed, but 
her hair covers 
her breasts. 

"These pho-
tos reveal 
no more of 
the models 
than one 
would see 
on the beach 
or in a fash-
ion magazine," 
sa id Executive 
Director of the 
Stud ent Press 
Law Cente r Mark 
G oorlman, a rguing 
that parental con em 
was not necessary in 
this situation. "When 
images are being used for a non-
commercial purpose as they were 
here, consent is only necessary 
when private information is being 
revealed." 

According to the 1973 U.S. 
Supreme Court decision in Miller 
v. California, for material to be 
obscene, "the average person, 
applying contemporary community 
standards [must] find that the work, 

artistic, political, 
or scientific value." 

The photographs do not illus-
trate such sexual acts or suggest 
them in a way that would be offen-
sive to the average person. When 
there is no obscenity, a high school 
does not have the jurisdiction to 
censor photographs, which renders 
the lawsuit completely invalid. 

The intent of th e photographs 
wa s clearly artisti c, not porno-
graphic or indecent: Beneath the 
photo spread, Free Flight ediror 
Matt Franks wrote: "The human 
form has been a subject of artists 
since the Creeks shaped Venus, 

Riley Salant·Pearce/Guardian 

Michaelangelo carved David, and 
Picasso reduced four women into 
smears of paint. Cia Battista, Ben 
Halstead and Monterey Salka step 
into frames to explore life as art and 
as artists." 

The validity ofSalka's complaint 
is even more questionable when 
considering her job as a model, for 
which she willingly takes risque 

photos. 
One photograph, fea tured in her 

profile on th e Pulse Management 
modeling agency Web site, depicts 
her wearing what appears to be a 
black bra and underwear - perhaps 
a bathing suit - and a pair of black 
boots, while another shows her in a 
lacy black bra and a skirt. Both of 
these pictures were taken with the 
consent of her parents, who filed no 
claim against the modeling agency. 

An aspiring model could use the 
publicity boo.st and the money this 
kind of claim provides. 

But even if the claim is in eamest 
and the parents are not out to cheat 
the system, one must still contend 

they have to take respon-
sibility for the care-
lessness with which 
they dealt with the 

matter. The par-
ents could have eas-
i I y req uested to see 
the photos before they 

went to print, yet they 
did not. 

Now thc claim could 
end up costing the dis-
triCt a significant amount 
of money at a time when, 

according to the Voiu of 
III! Diego, the San Dieguito 

Union lligh School Dismct 
is battling an estimated $6 million 
deficit for the current school year. 
Even if the courts rule in favor of 
the school district, the legal cost of 
the suit will take money from other 
students who could h3ve otherwise 
benefited from it. 

Costly lawsuits such as this pro-
vide incentive for schools to censor 
student publications in the future 
in a manner that would prove det-
rimental to free expression, going 
against one of the nation's most 
fundamental freedoms. So, before 
her "model behavior" causes any 
serious damage, Salka, along with 
her parents, need to drop this friv-
olous claim and its unwarranted 
attack on First Amendment rights. 

By shutting down SRTV, A.S. Council plays with fire 
Hats 
off @ 1: 

Vladimir Kogan 

I t's funny how far John Mujr College senior Steve York has fallen in just two years. Ln spring 
2004, he was a long-shot contender 
for UCSD's student presidency, 
armed with a fresh endorsement 
from the campus' official student 
paper. Last month, students saw 
him on Student-Run "Ielevision, 
ejaculating on the bare breasts of an 
adult movie actress. 

Though the transformation 
probably says more about the 
growth of the Guardilln's editorial 
board and quality of its endorse-
ments, the experience holds 
instructive lessons for the student 
body. This is especially true for 
those who dismiss York as a silly, 
destructive agitator. 

tn the run up to his presidential 
bid, York made a name for himself 
as an ardent critic of the University 
Centers fee referendum - the self-
imposed student tax that is paying 
for the curren t expansion of the 
Student Center. Though the ref-

erendum passed, many of his worst 
predictions have come true: The 
project is grossly over budget, with 
many of the promises made to stu-
dents likely to go unfulfilled . 

Few of us listened to him at the 
time. It's likely that York's current 
porn broadcasts have a similarly 
political message - perhaps about 
UCSD's lack of overall, um, fun 
- but even fewer are listening 
now. Members of the A.S. Council 
cerra inly aren't, as each does battle 
with the others in an effort to earn 
the title of the administration's big-
gest tool. 

The calls for council autonomy 
heard so often during last year's 
student elections have, for the most 
part, disappeared; those who spoke 
most passionately about it are now 
the ones who are most vehement 
in their condemnation of SRTV, 
essentially reading from the cam-
pus administrators ' script. . 

Their position creates an espe-
cially acute case of cognitive disso-
nance when compared to the same 
council's reaction in last year's co-
op debate. At the time, university 
administrators made a rather mild 
demand, requesting that the cam-
pus' student-run co-ops commit 
themselves to long-term leases. Yet 
rabid councilmembers went off the 
edge, threatening to retain their 

own lawyer and jumping into the 
fray, bogging the controversy in 
more than a year of apparently 
fruitless talles. 

But when sex hit the airwaves, 
the council was only too happy to 
disregard its own grievance proce-
dures adopted last spring, opting 
instead to take the words of the 
campus' counsel - not an inde-
pendent attorney - as gospel and 
rush to pass blanket regulations 
restricting televised content. Last 
week, they even took the station 
off the air. 

The reaction is particularly sur-
prising, given that SRTV is the 
A.S. Council's own service while 
the co-ops have largely tried to 
keep the student government at 
arm's length. 

In the case of the co-ops, though, 
the university actuaUy had a reason-
able point At least some of the 
co-ops, like the Che Cafe, appeared 
to use their previous, complicated 
space agreement to operate with dis-
regard for environmental laws, such 
as dumping waste into sewer drains. 
When university officials demanded 
that the problems be addressed, the 
co-ops used the complicated con-
flict adjudication process in their 
lease to tum the controversy into a 
bureaucratic nightmare. 

SRTY, though, violated no law. Its 

members simply broadcast a political 
message, one that may have hit too 
close to home for members of the 
AS. Council, who have done every-
thing they can to suppress it. After 
all, if students must tum to amateur 
porn for entertainment, what does 
that say about the so-called pro-
gramming and student opportunities 
the AS. Cowlcil spends student fees 
each year to fund? 

Most of the blame should be 
dumped at the feet of Kian Maleki, 
who served as A.S. commissioner of 
student services last spring, when 
porn was first broadcast on SRTV. 
When he first ran for the office, 
Maleki didn't even know what his 
office did. 

Last year, he went - in a single 
month - from being an ardent 
supporter of SRTV independence 
and its ability to broadcast any-
thing producers want, nude or 
not, to a zealot moralist opposed 
to porn. Maleki's bumbling han-
dling of the mess has only com-
plicated the options for current 
Commissioner of Student Services 
Maurice Junious. 

Another difference may be that 
fonner AS. President Jenn Pae was 
simply a stronger leader than her 
successor, Christopher Sweeten, 
whose panicky pleadings to council-
members leave much to be desired. 

With SRTV now off the air, 
students must pose some questions: 
Why should they continue paying 
for a so-called "service" that can 
broadcast only the political mes-
sages approved by their student 
government? Can they stiU trust 
their student government to spend 
$1.5 million in student fees when 
it has come to rely on unconstitu-
tional meetings and parliamentary 
procedures that stack the deck in 
favor of specific points of view? 

If students answer as I think they 
will, I predict some civil disobedi-
ence next month, when the univer-
sity comes to coUect a second-qllllr-
ter's worth of activity fees to give to 
the council. After aU, what better 
way is there to change behavior than 
through monetary incentives and 
fear of economic sanctions? 

Though the A.S. Council puUed 
the plug on SRTV last week, it 
won't be long before the student 
body pulls the plug on the council. 

York's pomomenrary is rife with 
meaningful messages, and members 
of the AS. Council best take good 
notes. After all, if they're not careful, 
York may not be the only one who 
finds himself with his pants down.

The lure of credit cards need not 
lead to college students' downfall 

By MEGAN DURHAM 
Contributing Writer 

W ho wants to be paying for a couple of pizzas you bought in college 
at age 30? Few students anticpate 
this scenario in their future, but 
many, due to aggressive market-
ing by credit card companjes, will 
graduate deep in debt. A recent 
report by Nellie Mae, a student 
loan provider that re earches credit 
cards on college campuses, notc.s 
that the average undergraduate 
finishes college more than $3,000 
in credit-card debt, along with an 
average of approximately $20,000 
in student loans for a four-year 
graduate. 

Even before students reach col-
lege, they are ovetwhelmed with 
preapproved credit card offers in 
the mail. 

The At/imtil Journal-Constitutirm 
reports that most young people 
get their first credit card either 
before or during their first year on 
Cdmpus. Young Americans Bank, 
for example, has issued more than 
300 credit cards to teens, some as 
young as 12. Many major credit 
card companies have cards designed 
specifically for college students, 
such as Discover, MasterCard and 
Citibank. At some colleges, accord-
ing to the Christian Scimce Monitur, 
promotional tables for credit cards 
abound on freshman regi tration 
and admit days. 

"Credit card companies are 
all over campuses," said Howell 
Edwards, the vice president of 
business development at the non-
profit credit counseling agency 
InCharge. And despite work on 
the pan of legislators and universi-
ties to restrict the access that credit 
card companies have to college 

students, the debt only increases. 
These days, three out of four 

college students have credit cards, 
and Nellie Mae reports that 43 
percent have four or more. The 
average balance that freshmen owe 
on their cards is reponedly $1,585, 
and that only grows with each year 
on campus. 

Credit cards are not all bad, 
as many students use them to 
build credit for future house or 
car loans. It's also common for 
parents to give them to students 
"for emergencies." Bur with credit 
cards, it is easy to get carried away. 
A card that starts out "just for 
emergencies" can easily turn into 

" [A]s credit card bills 
increase, GPAs faU and 
students are more Ukely 

to drop classes. " 
a card used for charging things 
like clothes, media, schoolbooks, 
or even food and alcohol. The 
results of such purchases can be 
devastating, especially if it's tough 
to find a job after graduation. It 
turns out that Americans between 
25 and 34 have the second highest 
rate of bankruptcy. 

Part of this is due to cardhold-
ers not paying off their bill com-
pletely each month, as companies 
make a fortune off of people only 
making the minimum payment. 
Look at it this way: If $1 ,000 is 
charged on a credit l"3rd with an 
annual rate of 17 percent, and a 
minimum monthly payment of$25 

is made, it will take five years to 
payoff the loan and $500 of that 
would just go for the interest. And 
that figure assumes that you are 
not using the credit card while you 
are paying it off. 

Such debt can be incred-
ibly stressful, as a University of 
Minnesota study found. The study 
found that as credit card bills 
increase, GPAs fall and students 
are more likely to drop classes. 
This problem is only exacerbated 
by the fact that many students 
don't even know the terms of their 
credit cards. MyVesta, a nonprofit 
consunler education organization, 
reports that 64 percent of credit 
card holders between the ages of 
18 and 24 don't know the interest 
rate they pay. 

Of course, that might not be 
entirely students' fault, because 
redit card terms are notoriously 
hard to decipher. According to 
the Nnu York Tmres, Harvard law 
professor Elizabeth Warren once 
asked a class of her third-year stu-
dents "to dissect the contract for 
a credit card that promised a 3 
percent cash-back bonus." By the 
end of the class period, they had 
only managed to decipher one of 
the terms - that there was really 
no cash-back bonus, only "a 3 per-
cent reduction on the card's 17.99 
percent A.P.R." 

But even if credit card con-
tracts were easier to deci pher, who 
wades through all of that paper-
work before they sign, anyway? 
All too often it's just easier to sign 
the fonn and struggle through the 
terms later. 

But why are credit card com-
panies targeting college students, 
especially freshmen, in the first

A Message to the Thurgood Marshall College & 
UCSD Community 
UCSD has recently been in the local and national news with regard to 

Student Run Television 's broadcasl of a show that included pornographic 
material. The broadcast on Thursday, October 27th included content 
directed towards a member of the Thurgood Marshall College community. 
These incidents have generated discussions about civility and freedom of 
speech, and have sparked a variety of emotions and opinions among 
studcnts, tafr, and faculty alike. 

The Thurgood Marshall College administration would like to take this 
opportunity to reaffinn our commitment to UCSD's Principles of 
Community. We hope that principles such as dignity, civi lity and respect 
will guide the Associated Students and campus community as we continue 
to address and respond to the myriad policy issues, intellectual concerns, 
and emotions that confront us. We al 0 hope that our philosophy of 
developing scholars and citizens will allow discourse that focuses on both 
the rights and thc responsibilities of each of us as a member of the UCSD 
and Thurgood Marshall College community, and that collectively we will 
be able to learn and grow from this experience in a po itive way.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7,2005 

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Student life needs 

more than SRTV refonn 
Dear Editor, 

While I don't personally care 
for hi s television show or his 
movie, I applaud Steve York for 
bringing some flair to this school. 
York's intentions may have been 
to ruffle a few feathers, but at 
least he 's trying to make some-
thing out of the bland campus life 
at UCSD. 

With that said, I think it's 
downright pathetic that York's 
movie is considered the most 
exciting thing going on here. 

l t seems that many of the 
Guardian's stories come back to a 
central theme: the lack of excite-
ment, spirit and community on 
campus. Maybe those problems 
could be rectified if the powers 
that be actually paid attention to 
the student satisfaction surveys 
and took some action instead of 
saying that "something needs to 
be done." 

Here are a few suggestions 
for making school bener, to any-
one that's willing to do some-
thing besides vote to resolve that 
they would rather not see naked 
breasts on SRTV: Be like any 
other Division II athletics pro-
gram and give prospective ath-

letes some monetary incentive to 
come here and win champion-
ships, thereby generating school 
pride and legacy. Let the students 
make some noise on campus after 
dark instead of stuffing write-ups 
down their throats . Finally, don't 
weigh my dining hall food on a 
scale before you serve it to me.

Students whine too 
much over parking 

Dear Editor, 
As soon as the new academic 

year starts, you can expect articles 
or letters to the editor complain-
ing about the parking situation at 
UCSD - it is as regular as the sea-
sons. I'd like to focus on one aspect 
of this year's letters: the complaints 
about the east campus (Regents) 
lots being too far from campus. 

If you visit most large universities 
in this country, you will find very 
few places where the majority of 
undergraduates are able to park any 
closer to the main campus than the 
distance between the east lots and 
Price Center. Many of those places 
have worse weather than here, less 
adequate (if any) shuttle systems, and 
(supposedly) a less fit student popu-
lation. Somehow the students at 
these places get by - why is it such 
an issue here? Do we have lazier stu-
dents, or louder complainers? 

it probably would make sense to 
improve andlor add sidewalks along 
Voigt Drive between the east lots and 
Gilman Drive. I suspect, however, 
that few students would use them.

place? Nellie Mae says that cred-
it card companies target students 
because research has shown that 
student borrowers tend to stay loyal 
to their first credi t card brand for 
many years in the future. 

If a credit card company can 
gain many first-time cardholders, 
then they have a huge advantage 
in the market. A report by Senator 
Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) also 
states that 18- to 24-ycar-olds often 
make small purchases that are likely 

to add up unnoticed, and are also 
the least likely to be able to payoff 
their entire monthly balance, giving 
the companies large profits. 

More than that, college students 
have one huge asset as far as cred-
it card companies are concerned: 
their parents. "1 t1Unk there is an 
asswnption that even if parents are 
not co-signing for cards, they are a 
fallback," said Marie T. O'Malley, 
Nellie Mae's marketing chief. "If 
little Joey doesn't cOllle through 
with his payment, he's likely to ask 

his parents for money. " 
Credit cards can be helpful, but 

only if the balances are paid off 
quickly and interest isn't allowed 
to accurnulate. Examine the terms 
before you sign, look for the best 
interest rate and try to find a card 
without a high penalty rate or an 
annual fec. If you find yourself 
unable to pay your bills on time, 
try to keep only one card, prefer-
ably one with a low credit line. In 
the end, remember that even small 
purchases can add up and affect you

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 200S THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 7 

SRTV: Watts moves show to Warren College Television after SR TV closure 
continued /ram page r 

the form of a taped interview broad-
cast by Earl Warren College senior 
Daniel Watts, the host of the politi-
cal show "Perfect Vision" on Warren 
College Television. Though SRTV 
co-Manager Andrew Tess had let 
Murphy and Chwn into the station 
earlier, they stepped outside shortly 
before Watts' show began and found 
themselves locked out. 

"That's when we knew sometlUng 
was up," Chum said later. 

Murphy pounded on the door as 
he saw the interview come on, dur-
ing wlUch York offered commentary 
on the council's ban. Later, Murphy 
recalled that he could not hear the 
video from outside of the door, mak-
ing the decision to take the signal 
down after seeing York's face on the 
screens inside. 

"It was not a scheduled show," 
Murphy said to an angry crowd that 
was helping Watts with the show, as 
the two sides met outside of the sta-
tion. "You guys violated the rules." 

Several students reacted angrily. 
"Is t1Us your guys' doing?" Sixth 

College junior Michael Toillion 
asked Churn. 

Noncommittal, Chum simply 
turned away. 

"Oh, pleading the Fifth 
[Amendment]," Toillion said, refer-
ring to the right of criminal suspects 
to refrain from self-incrimination. 
"God forbid you'd plead the First." 

After Watts' crew refused to stop 
taping the confrontation, Murphy 
and Chum walked away. 

"Maurice told us that if anything 
goes awry, to take the necessary 
action," Murphy said on his way 
from SRTV to his office. 

Tess said later tha t evening that hc 
saw no problems with Watts' show. 

"It was not something d13t was 
produccd by Steve York," the station 
co-manager said. "I do not sec any 
violation of the bilL" 

Tess also said he thought the pro-

ducers were correct to keep Murphy 
and Chwn out, explaining that sta-
tion policy placed responsibility on 
the SRTV member whose door code 
was last used to enter the facilities. 

Watts' crewmembers, who last 
used the code, said they werc afraid 
to let Murphy in, pointing to a 
recent physical assault thattook place 
on station premises by a dnmken 
VIewer. 

"I think it was very appropriate to 
not let [Murphy) in," Tess said. 

Later, Junious said he had specifi-
cally not given Murphy and Chum 
a door code because the two were 
not trained in the safety procedures 
necessary to be in the studio unsu-
pervised. 

"Regardless of what's going on 
with A.S., there are still rules that 
SRTV has and I wanted to respect 
them," he said. 

Junious said that his e-mail ask-
ing for only prerecorded shows to 
be aired was also not absolute, and 
was more a suggestion to station 
management. 

Exile to Warren 
By II p.m., Watts and his crew 

had relocated to Warren College 
Television, where his "Perfect 
Vision" was scheduled to air. The 
move was a poignant one: Less than 
two years earlier, Warren adminis-
trators shut down wcr after Watts 
aired a video depicting the behead-
ing of an American contractor in 
Iraq. On Nov. 3, \Vatts was using 
the station to air content banned 
from RIV. 

At the end of the show, York 
also made a live guest appearance to 
answcr questions. 

Murphy said the decision to tum 
off the SRTV signal was justified 
because Watts' staffinduded people 
who helped air "Koala TV," people 
that he aid were pecifically banned 
by last wcek's legislation. Ln p~r­
ticular, he singled out Sixth College 

sophomore Brian Holt, who had IUs 
own SRIV show scheduled to begin 
at II p.m. 

Holt said he admitted to speaking 
out during the public comment peri-
od at a recent AS Council meeting 
in support of York, but denied that 
he had worked on York's porn. 

"If the resolution had said me, 
1 would have happily complied," 
Holt said. . 

But another person present during 
Watts' show - a tlUrd-year graduate 
student who asked to not be identi-
fied for fear that he, as a univer-
sity cmployee, could face retaliation 
- sairl he had helped YorL: co-pro-
duce several of his shows. However, 
he said that the A.S. Council's ban 
on "Koala TV" only proved that 
council members misunderstood how 
SRTV functions. 

"I'm just an engineer, I do a lot 
of shows," he said. "Everyone helps 
everyone else at the station . .. . The 
problem is, that's the way SRTV 
works." 

Crossed Wtre5 
At midnight, Warren sopho-

more Elle Maglonzo had arrived 
at SRTV for the start of her own 
show, only to fin~ the station 
deserted and dark. 

"I think it's assy - it sucks," she 
said several minutes later. "I woke 
up to do my show and ('m here 20 
minutes after it was supposed to 
begin. And I could be asleep. " 

Juniousarrivedshortlyafter I a.m., 
and was soon engaged in an hour-
long, and at times confrontational, 
phone conversation with Tess. 

By 2 a.m., laglonzo had gone 
home, widl her show unaired and 
thc st'.ltion still off the air. 

The next afternoon, SRTV was 
3!,rain broadcasting, shuwing rccord-
ed reruns. At approxim:Hcly 3 p.m., 
the shows were replaced with a black 
screen readin g: "The Associatcd 
Students (A.s.) is now censoring

College, wait on Nov. 4 for AS. Commissioner of Student SelVices Maurice Junious. 
content on SRTV." 

But by the end of day, the station 
was again off the air. 

"I don't know the specifics of 
what happened," SRTV co-Manager 
Tiffany Rapp said, explaining that 
she believed the station wouJd be off 
air at least until Nov. 9, the date of 
the next scheduled meeting of the 
A.S. Council. 

A note posted on SRTV's win-
dow on Nov. 5 stated that the A.S. 
Council suspended the service until 
further noticc. 

Watts saidJunious decided to keep 
the station off because councilmem-
bers lacked the resources to monitor 
the broadcasts in person and round-
the-dock. Junious did not return sub-
sequent calls seeking comment. 

Donald R. McLaughlin, an 
Administrative Computing and 
Telecommunications director who c 
dcparunent ovcr<;ees Triton Cable, 
also did not respond to messages for 

comment. 
However, slwnped in a chair in 

the station at approximately 3 3.m. 
on ov. 4,Junious spoke freely and 
with regret about the controversy, 
blaming poorly written SRIV gov-
erning documents for the mess. 

"We're f.lced with a charter that 
isn't that great, and that has created 
problems for me, Alldy rre sJ and 
Tiffany [Rapp]," he said. 

The emergency content regula-
tions approved by the AS Council 
were necessary until a new char-
ter could be written , according to 
Junious. 

" I guess whcn it comes down 
co it, SRTV is an A.S. service and 
part of the university and subject 
to rules," he sa id. " If the unive rsity 
wants [0 pull the plug on SRTV, it"

a law that made parental consent necessary for minors. It 
was later found to be unconstirutional by the California 
Supreme Court and thus was never enacted. 

Each side of the proposition has questioned the other's 
motives. Critics of the proposition allege that California 
has historically been one of the most liberal states when 
it comes to abortion rights, and that Proposition 73 is 
being used to slowly chip away at those rights. They also 
point to the proposition's ten, which defines abortion as 
the killing of an "unborn child." 

"The proposition names the ferus as an unborn 
child," said Chelsea Cormier, president of UCSD's 
Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance. "This is the 
first step in saying abortion is murder and that [the) 
right [to an) abortion should be taken away." 

But proponents of the initiative reject the claims, say-
ing Proposition 73 will not affect rights to abortion. 

"[Opponents of th e proposition) should know bet-
ter," Fredenburg said. "It does not and cannot affect 
the availabili ty of abortion." 

Those claiming foul play have also pointed to the 
contributions of San Diego publisher James Holman, a 
well-known anti-abortion activist. Holman, who owns 
the Son Diego ReaM as well as some lay Catholic publica-
tions, has persona lIy contributed almost $800,000 in sup-
port of the proposition through Life on the Ballot, which 
banlcrolled efforts to place the initiative on the ballot. 

A1hin Rhomberg, a spokesperson for Life on the 
Ballot, said that the claim that Proposition 73 will lead to 
a lower availability of abortions is an attempt to distract 
voters from the issue. He says that Holman has a stalce in 
the proposition beCd use he is the futher of four girls.

Rohmberg said. "They get a lot of 
revenue for doing abortions and I 
believe that they have very strong 
financial interest in this issue." 

California voters seem to be 
just as split on the issue of parental 
notification. The latest polls show 
that 49 percent oppose the propo-
sition and 41 percent support it, a 
reverse from previous weeks. 

"J'm surprised that there's been 
a switch in opinions in the past few

Thad Kousser said. "This is one of

Housing or not, balanced life goes on for Greeks 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

News Editor 

Even without the luxury of university-sanctioned Greek housing, Sigma Chi 
Social Chair Alex Carstens spear-
headed a Halloween event that 
brought out about 2,000 party-
goers, 10 hired security guards 
and a whole lot of noise at the 
fraternity's Carmel Valley house 
far from ca mpus. 

Thc ncxt day, Carstens gOt an 
carly start on his finals , studying 
macroeconomics at an on-campus 
library. 

So goes the life of many 
UCSD so rority and fraternity 
members, whose behavior ill-fit-
ting the empty-headed stereo-
type has created a morc balanced 
Greek student life, according to 
Interfraternity Counci l President 
, am Sui . 

" \"'hen you combine the ocial 
goa ls of a fraternity and the high 
academic goals of UCSD, you get 
a stable splice of students ," he 
sa id . " I hate to use a cliche, but we 
work hard and we play hard." 

Sui's philosophy has inserted 
a term unique to Greek system 
stereotypes: education . 

"We're not representative of 
the entire nation, " Pan hellenic 
Council Pres ident Heather 
Doshay said. " \Ve don t have many 
problems like yo u see in the media 
with hazing and alco hol. \"'e're 
actually highly academic." 

Although I FC and Panhellenic 
Council require a minimum 2.5 
GPA, both rank higher than the 
UCSD average student population, 
Doshay sa id. [n addition, every 
single sorority chapter has an offi -
cer charged with enforcing chol-
arship requirements and distribut-
ing awards for students with high 
GPAs. 

The balance between work and 
play is exactly what is lacking at 
an academically sound, but socia l-
ly fractured (:ampus, a committee 
exploring undergraduate student 
satisfaction found earlier this year. 
But the committee also found that 
popular sentiment paints the Greek 
life in a different shade. 

"Students who join Greek stu-
dent orga ni zations scem to be 
exceedi ngly disenfranchised by 
the campus and view the cam-
pus attitude toward them as hos -
tile," the Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction com-
mittee stated in a report outlining 
its findings. 

However, within the Greek 
system, the committee found 
exactly the opposite, and report-
ed that join ing a fraternity or 
sorority provided more pride and 
satisfaction with the college expe-
rience . 

Estab lishing a stro nger Greek 
system may also be the medicine 
for an ailing alumni base. Colleges 
that receive the largest alumni 
donations arc usually composed 
of Greek graduates, who feel a

stronger relationship to the cam-
pus, Sui said. 

"There is a certain element of 
disconnect with UCSD," he aid. 
"Alumni don't feel as obligated 
to give, and as a result we have a 
huge lack of alumni donation. You 
look at campuses where you have 
the most giving, and those people 
are mostly from Greek organiza-
tions, and most have some sort of 
housing." 

Sui , a candidate la t year for 
A.S. Vice President External, [Out-
ed plans on his platform to estab-
lish Greek housing near campus. 

UCSD's Greek siblings at San 
Diego St.ate University have an 
award-winning, $16-million, 1.4-
:Icre Fraternity Row that houses 
264 students and eight fraternity 
chapters. 

A $27 million sorotity row is on 
the way, also paid for by the San 
Diego State Research Foundation. 

"We're all excited about the 
prospect of Greek housing," San 
Diego State Panhellenic Council 
Public Relations Officer Kelsey 
Knight said. " Living with 34 girls 
between 12 rooms is very different 
from living in the dorms." 

Mile the Greek housing would 
be an obvious step forward for 
UCSD, that movement won't be 
completed anytime soon, according 
to Doshay. 

"UCSD has always planned for 
it, but it just hasn 't been a focus," 
she said. "Ta lks have heightened a 
bit this year during the summer, 

Alexander Varond/Guardian 
Animal house: A report released this year found that members of UCSD Greek 
organizations are more satisfied with the college experience than expected. 
but it's a long-term plan . It will be 
here someday, but not in the next 
four years." 

A major hurdle for such plans 
is administrative priority, which 
currently lies elsewhere. 

"Until such time as UCSD can 
guarantee at least two years of 
on-campus housing for every new 
freshman and transfer student, the 
campus should not provide any 
theme housing that is not equally 
acce sible to every UCSD student 
with an on-campus housing guar-
antee," Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W Watson said. 

Across the city, San Diego 
State has had strong support from 

its administrators, who established 
the need for a Sorority Row when 
chapters began losing their houses 
to redevelopment, Knight said. 

But the comparison ofUCSD's 
upscale La Jolla with San Diego 
State's environment is unfair, 
according to Bui . 

"In the evolution of our cam-
pus, there has always been a vision 
for campus village and affordable 
housing," he sa id. "But areas like 
the UTC shopping mall deterred 
any simj lar campus village idea. 
We only house about one-fifth of 
our students, and you have people

Greeks: UCSD frat row still far down the road 
continllcd from /JagC I 0 

living in Mira Mesa, downtown 
and Hillcrest because of a lack of 
affordable convenience." 

Even with the expenses, Sui 
admitted that there is urgency for 
both general and Greek ho using 
sanctioned by the university. 

"When you bring in housing for 
the campus, you're going to bring 
more students into campus, and 
there's going to be more vibrancy 
in the university'S social image," he 
said. "As of now, the majority of 

students have no university pride 
and no one really has a connection 
to their college. The demand for 
housing is there, but there is no 
supply." 

The student environment would 
even change phy iedlly with Greek 
housing, Doshay said, transforming 
a barren camp us into an energetic 
community. 

"On weekend , there's nobody 
around here," she said. "Visiting 
friends at different schools, the 
campus is buzzing even on the 

weekends just like any other day. 
But creating Greek housing would 
require a huge amount of effort 
from entitie inside and outside of 
the university." 

With the days of "Anima l 
Ilouse" long gone, it looks like 
UCSD Greek organizations will 
have to wait for a "row" they can 
ca ll their own. 

"As a school, we arc definitely 
set academically," Carstens said. 
"But being a reek is a different 
kind of education ."

Tritons race toward national title 
Hodgins takes first place at NCAA West Regional 

By LAUIEN KAfO 
Staff Writer 

Coming off an impressive 
first-place finish at the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championship, the UCSD wom-
en's cross country team remained 
at the rop of its game, placing 
second at the NCAA Division II 
Cross Country West Regional 
Championship on Nov. 5 in Chino 
Hills, Calif. 

With the stellar finish, the 
women will move on to the NCAA 
National Championshjps on Nov. 
19. 

The Triton men's team, which 
also participated in the West 
Regional Championship, wrapped 
up its season with a seventh-place 
finish. 

The Triton women finished 
with 62 points, 20 less than Chico 
State, which also placed second to 
the Triton women at the league 
championship twa weeks agl? 

The women's team fin-
ished a sizable 67 points ahead 
of the third-place team, Alaska 
Anchorage University, thanks to 
the top-five Triton sprinters all 
finishing among the top 20 overall 
runners. 

Senior Mimi Hodgins fol-
lowed her CCAA Championship 
victories with the NCAA West 
Regional title. Hodgins finished 
first in a field of 146 runners 
with a time of 21 minutes, 59.80 
seconds, beating the second-place 
finisher from Chico Sta te by 2.1 
seconds.

ish in the West Regional race

from last year, moving up from

Senior Erin O'Donnell was 
the second-fastest Triton woman, 
finishing in seventh overall 
with a time of 22:30. Following 
O'Donnell for UCSD was sopho-
morc Emily McGregor, who fin-
ished in 15th overall with a time 
of 23:04.50. 

Senior Michelle DiMeo fin-
ished in 19th place overall with 
a time of 23:28. Rounding out 
the top-five Triton finishers was 
junior Nina Miller, who, hot on 
DiMeo's tail, finished only half 
a second later. The duo finished 
with times of23:28.1 and 23:28.6, 
respectively. 

The No. 25 Triton men posted 
a seventh-place finish to end their 
2005 season. Chico State won 
the men's NCAA West Regional 
title and Cal Poly Pomona placed 
second. Alaska Anchorage finished 
in third to win the final NCAA 
National Championship spot. 

Freshman Gabriel LaMothe 
was the fastest Triton for the men's 
team, finishing in 38th place. His 
time of 34:37.20 was only twO 
seconds faster than senior Carl 
Lostrom, who came in 39th, a dis-
appointment after his 26th-place 
finish last season. 

Freshman Jake LeVieux fin-
ished third for UCSD, and in 
40th overall, with a time of 34:39. 
Fellow freshman Matthew Noble 
followed in 43rd place, with a time 
of 34:42. Junior Dan Holligan was 
the last of the scoring Triton men, 
his time of 34:54 earning him 47th 
overall. 

Seniors Chris Beetley-Hagler 
and Luke Sigmon ended their 
UCSD cross-country careers with 
56th- and 59th-place finishes, 
respectively. Beetley-Ilagler fin-
ished in 35:07, 28 seconds faster 
than Sigmon's 35:35. 

This is the second year in a row 
that the men 's team has failed to 
qualify for the CAA Division IT 

. National Championship. Its last 
visit was in 2003, where it finished 
17th. 

The Triton's 197 -point score 
this year was down from last year's 
fourth-place finish, which was just 
shy of qualifying for a spot in the 
championship race. 

The women's team will travel 
back to the course at Chino Hills 
on Nov. 19 to participate in the 
NCAA National Championship, 
the fou.rth consecutive visit for the 
fifth-ranked team. It placed 17th 
in 2002, 16th in 2003 and came in 
17th place again last year.

'Soccer: Six Tritons earn All--CCAA honors 
continued from page 16 

ed the ball low to beat Ruhland at 
the 36-minute, 24-second mark to 
seize a 1-0 head start. 

The Sea wolves' second goal 
came off the foot of David Seidel 
after he made an open-field run 
and beat Ruhland on a one-on-
one breakaway opportunity in the 
86th minute to give Sonoma the 
2-0 lead. 

Determined not to concede the 
game easily, however, the lritons 
attempted a belated comeback. 

"[Sonoma State) did not have 
such a great defense," Ruhland 
said. 

Sophomore Pat Kelly took 
advantage of Sonoma State's weak 
defense and notched his third 
goal of the season, cutting the 
Seawolves' advantage to one goal 
after he beat Sonoma State junior 
goalkeeper Clark Rupp at the 
88:06 mark. 

Interestingly, and perhaps aided 
by Sonoma State's traditionally 
subpar defense, Kelly was previ-
ously responsible for the sole goal 
in UCSD's 1-0 victory at Sonoma 
State earlier in the year. 

At a crucial corner k.ick, UCSD 
head coach Derek Armstrong 

switched out the Tritons' goal-
keeper, and put in freshman Luis 
Salazar as an extra man on the 
attack. 

However, the substitution 
backfired. 

Larson nened his second goal 
of the game after he was able 
to clear the comer kick, scoring 
an empty-net goal with only 40 
seconds left in the game to clinch 
the decisive 3-1 triumph over the 
Tritons. 

"In the second half, we pushed 
our defenders forward to the 
midfield to try to create better 
offensive opportunities," Ruhland 
said. "[Sonoma State) made lots of 
threats to the goal in the second 
half." 

rn almost every statistical cat-
egory, the match was extremely 
close. 

While each team managed to 
make three saves in the contest, 
Sonoma State out-shot the Tritons 
by a 12-10 margin. 

The Sea wolves took the big-
gest margin over the TIitons in 
securing corner kicks. Sonoma 
State had seven free kicks from 
the corner compared to only one 
for the Tri tons. 

The Seawolves will now face 
the winner of the second semifinal 
match in Turlock, Calif., between 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
Cal State San Bernardino, with 
the winner taking home the CCAA 
Championship title. 

UCSD's NCAA postseason fate 
is still undetermined. The partici-
pants for the NCAA Tournament 
will be announced on Nov. 7. 

The 24-team rournament will 
feature three teams from each of 
the eight regions. 

Earlier last week, six players 
from the Tritons were selected for 
the A11-CCAA teams. 

Seniors Matt Davey and 
Edward Ruhland were awarded 
First-Team honors. 

On the Second Team were 
freshman Devon Cook and junior 
Matt Horne, who helped anchor 
a stingy Triton defensive unit 
this season, along with senior Jon 
Krupansky. 

Junior Chase Douglas earned 
his second-straight A11 -CCAA 
Honorable Mention. Joining 
Douglas on the Honorable 
Mention squad were junior Dustin 
Tannenhaus and senior Kevin 
Murray.

Shirley and past the far post. Iler 
sister, Rachel McDonald, assisted 
her on the first score and gave her 
a one-time pass for Britmy's second 
goal and Rachel's second a sist of 
the night. 

Despite the McDonald sis-
ters' valiant comeback efforts, the 
Tritons held on in the second half, 
tak.ing the title from the Toros and 
giving their seniors at least one 
more game to play together. 

The 'Triton seniors' season 
would have been over on Nov. 4, 
however, had they not pulled off a 
narrow I -0 victory over Chico State 
in the CCAA semifinals to advance 
to the title game. 

"We were a little sloppy in the 
first half, but after [sophomore] 
Caitlin Ryan's comer kick and the 
incredible header by Gunior] Megan 
Dicli.ey, we went after the Wildcats," 
head coach Brian McManus said. 

With the news of her CCAA 
Most Valuable Player award still 

fresh in her mind, Dickey showed 
why she deserved the honor, net-
ting her 13th goal of thc season. 

The offensive bonanza provided 
by the Tritons in the econd half 
contrasted to the lackluster efforts 
that the team showed during parts 
of the first half. 

"The Wildcats pounded on us 
all the time for about 15 minutes in 
the first half," junior Kelly Cochran 
said. 

Dickey's efforts produced aU tile 
offen c nccessary for the Tritons' 
win and was significant as it was her 
third game-winner of the eason 
and the eighth of her three-year 
career. 

The goal came at the 55-min-
ute, five-second mark of the second 
half, after Ryan provided the assist 
off a corner kick, sending a pass 
across the box. 

Dickey then headed it past 
Chico State's sophomore goalic 
Kari Gon7.ales to mark the sole 
goal of the game. 

"""" 

"Ln the second half, we were 
threatening all the time and we 
took advantage of the situation," 
Cochran said. 

Ln almo t every statistica l cat-
egory, UCSD edged out Chico 
State. 

UCSD our-shot the Wildcats by 
a 13-6 margin and took four more 
corner kicks in the match . 

Another noteworthy perfor-
mance came from Shirley, who 
recorded her seventh shutout of 
thc season. 

Shirley made three saves on the 
night, while Gom.ales was only able 
to make one save. 

"Everyone played excellent 
defense and we pulled it togethcr 
really well," Cochran said . 

Not only did the two wins 
give the Tritons the CCAA 
Championship and improve their 
final season record to 17-3-0, but 
it also improved UCSD's record in 
CCAA tournament play to 10-1 -0 
since joining the league in 2000.

Seniors depart as CCAA champs 
Women's soccer wins fifth title in six years

T he o. 17 UC Sa n Diego 
women 's soccer team extended 
its season by at least one game 
by winning their fi fth Cali fo rnia 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
ti tle in the las t six years over 
Cal ta te Domi nguez Ilills by a 
score of 4-3 on ov. 6 in Turlock, 
Ca lif. 

With the win, the Tritons 
earned themselves a spot in the 

CM Di vis ion II Far West

play on ov. II. The CCi\i\ cham-

Sophomore forward Kath y 
Sepu lveda wa the unlikely hero of 
the evening for the Tritons, notch-
ing her first goal of the yea r at the 
most opportune time. Sepulveda 
scored an unassisted goa l in the 
15th mi nute on the 101'0 ' fresh-
man goalkeeper Lisa gramonte 
to give the Tritons the slim lead. 

The Toros bounced back as 
Candace Ilea rn took advantage 
of the Tritons own fre hman net-
minder, Mia Shirley, with an unas-
sisted goal and knotted the cham-
pionship game up at the 19A3 
mark of the first half. 

The Tritons fought to avoid a 
halftime tie and succeeded with a 
go ahead goal in the 37 th minute 
off a penalty kick from freshman 
forward Natasha Belak-Berger. It 
was Belak- Berger's seventh goal

After its 3- 1 loss to Sonoma 
State on ov. 4 in the Ca liforn ia 
Co ll egiate Athl etic Association 
pl ayoffs, the No. 19 UCS D men's 
soccer tea m's season is now in the 
hands of the CAA. 

"W e had lo ts of scoring chanc-

[Sonoma State] had some lucky 
goals that forced us to come from 
behind," UCS D senior goalkeep-
er E dwa rd Ruhland sa id . 

T he loss dropped the T ri tons 
to 11 -5-2 on th e season and 8-5-

Seawolves adva nced to the Nov.

The rout was the first time 
in 2005 that UCSD had surren-
dered more than two goals in a

Sonoma State dominated the 
first half, with the Seawolves'
