IRVINE - The Reeve-levine 
Research Center, proposed and 
funded by philanthropist Joan 
Irvine Smith, could someday 
bring together neuroscientists 
from around the nation to 
study spinaJ.cord injurios and 
diseases. Smith said she was 
inspired by Reeve - who was 
injured in'a horseback-riding 
accident in May - and has 
agreed to donate $1 million to 
the center if UC Irvine raises 
another $2 million. Medical 
experts say that the cure for 
spinal cord injuries lies in the 
regeneration of nerve cells, a 
technology which they say is 
about seven years away.

ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. -
Archaeologists at the Univer-

hav~ uncovered the remains of 
a fort which protected the first 
European colony in America. 
The fort, which is near the 
Fountain of Youth park in 
Florida, is believed to have 
been established by the 
Spanish colonial settler 
Mendez de Avils in 1565, 
along with about 800 other 
Spanish settlers. The dig was 
led by Kathleen Deagan, who 
has worked at the site since 
1986 and has unearthed 
European-style building 
outlines, as well as Spanish 
beads and pollery.

advertisement was slanted in 
favor of white men. By asking 
for "dynamic" professors, 
Giraldo said the ad inferred 
VJat women and minorities 
were less qualified for the job, 
because they are generally less 
assertive than their white-male 
counterparts. The university 
changed the wording of the 
ads to "excellent" in response 
to Giraldo's concerns.

Regents Delay MrlfDlative-Action Vote 
MEETING: Action 
indefinitely postponed 
on Gomez's motions 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Associate News Editor 

SAN FRANCISCO - Before a 
packed auditorium and numerous 
members of the media, the UC Board 
of Regents Thursday overwhelm-
ingly reaffirmed its staunch support 
of abolishing race-and gender-based 
admissions and hiring practices in 
the UC system. 

The board voted by a 12-4 mar-
gin to indefinitely postpone action 
on motions SP-I 0 and SP-II, two 
measures introduced by Student 
Regent Edward Gomez which 
sought to rescind the regents' July 
20, 1995 vote to end affirmative-
action programs throughout the Uc. 

Gov. Pete Wilson, an ex-officio 
member of the board making only 
his fourth appearance to a regents 
meeting in the last six years, argued 
adamantly in defense of last 
summer's measures, SP-I and SP-
2, which made the UC system the 

nation's only major institution to 
operate without affirmative action. 

"Last July, this board decided ... 
that every high school graduate in 
California should have an equal 
opportunity to compete for admis-
sions to the University of California 
based on individual merit, regard-
less of race," Wilson said. "It was 
the right decision then, and it's the 
right decision now." 

In addition, Regent Judith Levin 
was to have proposed her own mo-
tions,SP-15andSP-16, which would 
have made SP-I and SP-2 non-bind-

ing and would have delayed their 
implementation for one year while 
UC Office of the President (UCOP) 
conducted more detailed studies of 
their effects. 

However, during one of the more 
emotional moments of the meeting, 
Levin postponed action on her mo-
tions, citing the "continuing and bla-
tant political interference into the 
proceedings of the board and our 
inability to conduct full, rea oned 
debate and meaningful consulta-
tion."

IN CONFIDENCE ••• Spirit Night 
Draws 1,425 
ToRIMAC 
COMPETITION: Muir wrests 
'most spirited' trophy away 
from two-year winner Marshall 
By Mary Higgins 
Staff Writer 

UCSD Spirit Night , which has tradition-
ally set itself apart by being an evening of 
aggressive competition in the stands rather 
than on the court, drew 1,425 fans to Friday's 
men 's basketball game. 

While the Tritons lost to Master's Col-
lege during the game, a wide-scale competi-
tion rumbled in the bleachers between the 
five UCSD colleges, which were divided in 
the stands by individual banners. 

Posters, balloons, flyers, free food and 
face-painting before the game lured the stu-
dent body to RIMAC. Shirtless students with 
blue-and-yellow body paint eg&:d on the 
crowd by leading cheers - and later dis-
tracted the Master's players during free-
throws by dancing on the sidelines. 

At times, the screams of the audience 
threatened to overwhelm even the UCSD pep 
band. 

Aside: Gov. Pete Wilson confers with Regent Ward Connerly at last week's UC Board of 
Regents meeting in San Francisco. 

Despite the game's outcome, many spec-
tators left feeling triumphant - as Muir Col-
lege boasted the largest attendance, snatch-
ing the Spirit Night trophy from the two-year 
grasp of Marshall College.

SAN FRANCISCO - For the first 
time in its I 27-year history, the Uni-

The UC system was the third largest 
recipient of private gifts during the

the Red Cross. 

UCSD, in particular, received nearly 
$53 million of last year's total, an in-
crease of approximately two percent

the idea of a wasted vote holds any wa-
ter, it is in regards to the two political 

• giants, rather than the alternative politi-
cal parties. It is hard to believe that the 
voting public shares enough ideas and 

values with Republicans and Democrats to 
feel as though its votes for their candidates 
were well cast. 

The voting-party format is one element of 
our political system which is still open to re-
form. If we were to eliminate this format al-
together, the system would inevitably col- . 
lapse. But if we work within the existing 
framework by voting for a party which is sepa-
rate from the inaction and corruption of the 
major parties, we could still salvage what 
works in American politics. . 

Capitalism - as embodied by Republi-
cans and, to a lesser extent, Democrats -
is1hot something we can just pull the plug 
on without devastating economic conse-
quences. So, assuming capitalism re-
mains, the electorate needs to realize 
that with capitalism, there comes an in-
evitable tie-in with big business. For a 
gBvernment designed for and by the 
people, this affiliation with 
corporations is rather suspect: 
for if a corporation would 
readily exploit the public for 
profit, why wouldn't its partner, 
the U.S. government, do the 
same? The misinformed public, 
however, fails to ask itself this 
probing question, therefore pre-
venting third parties from making 
any difference. 

This affiliation is also problematic 
in that the decisions made by members 
of two major parties are strongly influ-
enced by campaign contributions from 
none other than corporations. This in-
fluence puts a huge amoun~of voting 
power in the hands of a few people, rather 

• than in the hands of millions of American 
voters - a situation stranaely similar to the 
voting practices of a few hundred years 110, 
when only rich, white landownen voted. The 
two major parties constitute a regression into 
our nation's troubled put. They offer IWth-
;'" to the overwhelming majority of voters. 

In some ways, it docsn' lcem IS though

Slaying the Three-Headed Monster: 
Why Third Parties Are Not a Solution 

recent Wall Street Journal 
poll found that 70 percent 
of American voters think 
the two-party system does 
or can work well. With this 
information, it is difficult 
to make sense of the recent 

populist cries for the formation of new 
political parties. 

In the same poll, only 10 percent 
said they intended to vote for a third-
party presidential candidate in this 
year's election. Moreover, only 37 per-
cent admitted there is even a SO-SO 
chance they would vote for any third-
party candidate. 

However, if Ross Perot's significant 
showing in the 1992 election is taken into 
account, it is easier to see why. third-
party fever has gripped the country's po-

litical pundits. If the American 
electorate's considerable disdain for 
politics, politicians, pundits and the sta-
tus quo could be harnessed and incar-
nated into a new political party, Ameri-
can politics might be changed forever. 

It is no surprise that several people 
have stepped forward offering to lead 
this political revolt Perot announced in 
late September he would lead an effort 
to get his revolutionary Independence 
Party on the ballot in all SO states. Based 
on a platform calling for campaign-fi-
nance reform, term limits, lobbying re-
form, Congressional ethics reform and 
a balanced budget amendment, the In-
dependence Party seeks to nominate a 
presidential candidate and 
endorse congressional 
candidates.

OPINION S 

~ •• INI'ARY: San Diego's local politicians, fearing negative publicity, avoid the 
Issue of needle exchanges even though such programs reduce the spread of IDV 

AIDS AND THE BUREAUCRATIC CHARADE 
., .. TNwIItt .... 
SpecjIJI to the Guard .. 

The politks of IUV prevention 
in San Dieao County are stranpr 
than Lewis Canoll's Alict in Won-
tkrlluttL 

A little more than a year ago, 
Pam Slater, then chairwoman of the 
county Board of Supervisors, pr0-
posed her 8O-perccnt solution to the 
AIDS epidemic, suuesling that ef-
forts should be focused on reduc-
ing sexual transmission of IHV in 
homosexual men - 80 percent of 
AIDS cues at the time. 

At the same time, she emphati-
cally rejected implementing HIV 
prevention strategies known to re-
duce the incidence ofHIV infection 
among injection drug users, a pre-
dominantly heterosexual popula-
tion. 

As the issue is revisited in the 
next few months, the local politics 
of HIV prevention will get 

• "curiouser and curiouser." 
In response to current political 

pressure to return more responsibili-
ties to local authorities, the Centers 
for Disease Control (CDC) has es-
tablished a mechanism to allocate 
federal funds for HIV prevention to 
each of the SO states. State govern-
ments, in tum, distribute these re-
sources to local communities. 

As a requirement to qualify for 
CDC funds (San Diego County 
would get SI.I million for 1996-
1997), the county has to develop a 

comprehensive HIV educaIion and 
prevention plan in collaboration 
with the community. 

This process began lui summer 
with the establishment of an IHV 
Prevention Community Planning 
Board. consisting of public-health 
professionals and members of com-
munities most affected by the AIDS 
epidemic. The board's mandate wu 
to draft ID IHV education and pre-
vention plan to present to the Board 
of Supervisors. 

In order for federal funds to be 
allocated to the community, the 
CDC requires an agreement be-
tween the supervisors and the plan-
ning board on prevention and edu-
cation priorities. 

After working diligently for four 
months, the board presented its re-
port to the Board of Supervisors on 
Dec . 12. The supervisors then 
turned the report over to COUnty staff 
for comment. 

As expected, an integral part of 
the report was the recommendation 
to enact a comprehensive plan to re-
duce HIV transmission in injection 
drug uses, a political anathema to 
the current Board of Supervisors. 

So what happens now, because the 
two boards must agree on the c0m-
prehensive plan in order for San Di-
ego County to qualify for federal 
funds? The most likely scenario is 
that, after changing seats at the Mad 
Hatter's tea party, the co-chairman of 
the IDV Prevention Community PIan-

ning Board, now acting in his official 
capacity as a member of the San Di-
ego County Office AIDS Coordina-
tion in the county Depanment of Pub-
lic Health, will quietly delete the rec-
ommendations for reducing IDV in-
fections in injection drug users that 
he himself supported in his role as a 
member of the planning board. 

The emasculated document will 
be returned to the Board of Super-
visors who quickly approve it, 
breathing a collective sigh of relief 
that they have once again avoided 
public discussion of such a politi-
cally sensitive issue. 

The planning board will then 
back down from its original recom-

mendations and agree to accept the 
modified report. San Diego County 
would receive its SI.1 million in 
CDC funding and, consequently, 
four months of work to develop an 
effective HIV prevention policy in 
this community will have been 
wuted. 

Maybe no one should care about 
this bureaucratic charade because, 
after all, the AIDS epidemic only af-
fects marginalized segments of so-
ciety, homosexual men and injection 
drug users. 

Maybe I care because I recently 
attended a memorial celebration for 
David Tamayo, a leading figure in 
the Sa:; Diego arts community who 
died of AIDS on Dec. 14, and was 
deeply moved by the words of his 
friends, including former Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor. Listening to 
them reminded me that AIDS also 
claims the lives of the best and most 
productive members of society, 
even in San Diego. 

But there are other compelling 
.reasons to care: AIDS is now the 
leading cause of death among both 
men and women aged 25 to 44 in 
64 cities nationwide, including San 
Diego. By 1993, AIDS cases in 
women, infected indirectly or di-
rectly through injection drug use, 
had increased to about one-third of 
the number of AIDS cases in homo-
sexual men nationwide, and a simi-
lar trend exists in San Diego. Het-
erosexual transmission of HlV also 

continues to increase. 
Perhaps the most explosive rea-

son to care, however, lies buried in 
the draft report itself. The response 
of the county supervisors, if you can 
get them to talk about the issue II 
all, is that IDV transmission through 
injection drug use is not a major 
problem in San Diego. 

Yet among the plethora of data 
in the planning-board report are sta-
tistics which grimly show that the 
prevalence of IHV infection in blaclt 
male injection drug users entering 
drug treatment has increased from 
zero percent in 1989 to 15 percent 
in 1993 in San Diego . 

Given the composition of the 
Board of Supervisors, it is easy to 
understand why they may be uncon-
cerned about the dramatic increase 
in HlV prevalence in this popula-
tion, but for San Diego's African-
American leaders, these statistics 
should be an immediate call to ac-
tion. 

Of course, based on the leiters I 
received last time I wrote on this 
subject, I would not be surprised if 
some San Diegans seethe increased 
prevalence of HIV infection in in-
jection drug users as offering a Iong-
term solution to the drug problem. 

I hope, however, that the Board 
of Supervisors will adopt a more re-
sponsible position and enter into 
public debate about how to reduce 
the spread of AIDS through injec-
tion drug use.

CHANGE: 
Two parties don't 
represent country 
ContInued from INC. 4 
agendas would be able to secure 
enough congressional votes to get 
anything passed . But when the 
corporations team up under a com-
mon cause - securing profit -
they are able to pass a significant 
amount of bills. 

Essentially. those with enough 
money are able to control the gov-
ernment, while the middle and 
lower classes are silenced. How-
ever, a combination of numerous 
third party members in local. state 
and national positions will 
strengthen the people's voice, not 
the corporations'. 

Voters need to be wary. how-
ever, because the strong arm of big 
business extends far beyond our 
nation's capital. As the misin-
formed TV drone makes his politi-
cal decisions based on what he 
hears from the media. the barrage 
of commercials supporting certain 
candidates or initiatives makes an 
impact on the electorate. The 
funding for these commercials of-
ten comes directly from big busi-

nesses. 
Third-party candidates, on the 

other hand, do not advertise on 
television and circulate only a 
minimal amount of flyers, if any. 
This gives voters the confidence 
of knowing that the issues sup-
ported by a particular candidate 
are actually those of the candidate, 
not of some corporate giant. Al-
though this should not be a novel 
idea, it is one which is lacking in 
the major campaign party. 

Certain third-party groups do 
wield some power on Capitol Hill. 
such as the American Association 
of Retired Persons (AARP), re-
garded as one of the most power-
ful lobbies in Washington . Be-
cause this group is supported by 
so many retired voters nationwide, 
it has substantial clout in Con-
gress. The ideas championed by 
AARP are those of retired people, 
demonstrating the potential 
strength of third panies. This 
strength can only be tapped when 
people choose to vote for the al-
ternative choices, rather than 
wasting their vote on major can-
didates. 

Voting for one of the two ma-
jor parties leaves the public with 
no political leverage. The main

tion of church and state, environ-
mental protection, welfare and so-
cialized medicine - just to name 
a few. If a voter agrees with only 
a portion of one of the major par-
ties' platforms. he should not be 
forced into voting Republican or 
Democrat because, ·in effect, this 
lends his support to issues with 
which the voter doesn't agree. 
Third parties lack these diverse 
platforms, giving the voter an op-
portunity to choose a candidate 
from a party who represents the 
views and opinions of the voter. 

A few examples of third-party 
organizations are the Green Party, 
the Peace & Freedom Party and 
the Libertarian Party - groups 
with which everyone might not be 
familiar, but should be. 

These entities represent coali-
tions of people centered around 
single. unique ideologies. For in-
stance. the Green Party practices 
politics with a strictly environ-
mentalist agenda, while the Peace 
& Freedom Party works for a so-
cialized government. The liber-
tarian Party. on the other hand , 
works to eliminate virtually all 
government. The bOllom line is 
that third parties allow people to 
vote for their priorities. 

OPINION 7 

To put the current political cli-
mate in perspective, let's say that 
a given voter is primarily con-
cerned with the issues of social-
ized health care and environmen-
talism. In the two-party format , 
the best option is to vote Demo-
crat. However. if these two issues 
are secondary priorities to the 
Democrat who is voted into office. 
the voter will not have his needs 
mel. On the other hand. if the voter 
supported a third-party member 
who supported these issues as his 
sole priorities. then the vuter 
would be assured that his candi-
date would fight for his needs, if 
elected. 

The existence of third parties 
is no secret - they just do not ad-
vertise as heavily as the major par-
ties. The focus of third panies. 
unlike that of Republicans and 
Democrats, is not on the pocket-
book behind the candidates - it 
is concerned with concrete issues. 
Voters should have the power to 
support the issues they care about . 
not just for faces and big-name 
parties who are swayed by big 
numbers and muddled agendas. 
Third panics offer clear platforms, 
and cater to only one group: their 
voters.

However. these nucent politi-

pears to be merely a tool for

idea is hardly new: Perot's 
"gr&Uroots" olJanization "United 
We Stand America" has been ve-
hemently criticized from its incep-
tion for ill autOcratic charKter. By 
the same token, the Lamm ,rouP 
hu conducted its deliberations in 
ncar-absolute accrecy. Bill Brad-
ley, in announcin, his retirement 
from the Senate lut fall. seemed 
leu than forthri,ht about the po-
litical beliefs which prompted his 
departure. and was downrilht coy 
when il came to his presidential 
upirations. It is Ihis kind of po-

But why does the need for

that Republicans are just as bad as 
Democrats when Republicans 
have strong notion. of limited

wish to preserve the ltatus quo of 
the welfare state. These parties 
represent the two fundamentally 
opposed visions of sovemment at 
worlt in contemporary American 
politics. 

The supporten of a third party. 
nonetheless. will ,0 on to cite a 
litany of example. to support their 
claim of a two-party system which 
has such a stranslehold on our 
elected officials that no important

is some truth to the claim that "the

wield less clout relati ve to the par-
ties. 

It is inlerestins to nole that the 
FoundinS Fathen were quite du-
bious of political parties. James 
Madison considered these "fac-
tions" to be sisnificant threats to 
democracy. It is easy to agree with 
him. considerins the utter chaos

which would result if we bad 100 
or 10 panidI competiDl for votes. 
Por there to be JOY«IUIIOIll, there 
must be a DKICIicum of CODICIIIUS. 
and consensus would be impoI-
lible to achieve in such &II envi-
ronment. Even thoaP our lOvern-
ment would not face the paraJysis 
that parliamentary democracies 
would (end often do) face in such 
a situation. it is hard to see how 
we could accomplish even the 
most rudimentary tasks of sovem-
ins· 

Yet it is important to note that 
our ,ovemment hu expanded far 
beyond ils rudimenlary tilItS. 
Government now replates every-
thinl under the sun. even in the 
manner of decidinl who earns 
what. When liberty and property 
are so restricted. when the stakes 
are as hiSh as they are. politics 
becomes contentious. driven by 
special interests. As the adase 
socs. "When the lovemment sets 
into the business of buyins and 
sellin" the first thin,s to be 
bouSht and sold are lesislaton." 
Is the weakness of our political 
parties responsible for the weak-
ness of our public policy. or is the 
weakness of our public policy re-
sponsible for the weakness of odr 
parties? We would do well to con-
sider both questions. :

Plea: UCSA Chair Kris Kohler implores the UC Board of Regents to 
reinstate affirmative-action policies. Kohler was later arrested and 
charged with trespassing and disturbing a public meeting.

Continued from PIlI. 3 
ment of a political party," Conkey 
said. 

Some professors however. sup-
ported the regents' resolve. 

"The old preference system was 
the cheap. quick and easy way to 
get diversity. while improving edu-
cation and schools is a harder but 
infinitely better way." UC Berke-
ley Graduate School of Public 
Policy Professor Martin Trow said. 

Despite the vote to postpone SP-

10 and SP-II. Regent Ralph 
Cannona remained optimistic fol-
lowing the meeting. saying the mo-
tions will "absolutely" be back for 
discussion in the coming month or 
two. 

In the meantime, UC President 
Richard Atki nson has pledged that 
UCOP will make sure that the out-
reach task forces, created as an 
extension of SP- I and SP-2, will 
remain in full swing. 

"We are commillcd to expand-
i ng these outreach efforts and will 
look to the Outreach Task Force 
and our campuses to make recom-
mendations for immediate and 
long-term programs." Atkinson 
said .

Muir participants spent about 
a month preparing for the Spirit 
Night competition. said Muirath-
Ie tic liaison Ping Yeh . 

Cooperation among the 
Dean's Office, the Resident Life 
Office and t~e Muir Housing 
Advisors resulted in an assault of 
propaganda launched upon the 
Muirons in the weeks leading up 
to Spirit Night. 

An inter-college competition 
between the houses. apartments 
and commuters added incentive 
for Muir students. Yeh added. 

"A lot of hard work paid off," 
Muir senior SCOII Haner said. 

However, Muir wa not the 

GIFTS: UCSD 
sets $75 million goal 
for fiscal 1995 
Continued from pace 1 
and External Relations William 
Baker said. "Tt is a fundamental part 
of our whole operating budget." 

Private support to UCSD from 
foundations was even with the pre-
vious year(atSI9.7 million}. while 
gifts from corporations slipped by 
about four percent to $10.3 mil-
lion. Donations from alumni and 
other individuals declined by 35 
percent to about SIO million. De-
spite these setbacks, private fund-

only college to tum out in im-
pressive numbers. 

Yeh applauded the efforts of 
the other colleges. particularly 
Marshall. whose students fin-
ished the spirit competition in 
second place. 

"We had the 'Walk of Stars' 
with all the names of the basket-
ball players on them." Marshall 
athletic liaison Carin Andron 
said. "We also did face-painting 
and posters." 

Revelle College had a pre -
game tailgate party . junior Mayra 
Gutierrez said; and Warren Col-
lege feasted at a free barbecue in 
front of Earl's Place. 

Warren. Roosevelt and 
Revelle colleges finished third, 
fourth and fifth in the spirit com-
petition, respectively. 

Various campus organiza-
tions , including the UCSD Book-
store, donated raffle prizes such 

ing for UCSD is still on the up-
swing. 

") think [the donors) haver rec-
ognized the caliber of the educa-
tional, research and patient-care 
programs that the university pro-
vides. and they have shown a strong 
commitment to supporting them," 
said UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
University Relations Bruce Dar-
ling said. 

According to UC Office of the 
President officials. 95 percent of the 
giflS received in 1994-95 wercdes-
ignated for specific purposes by the 
donors. while a mere 5.4 percent 
constituted unrestricted gifts. 

Baker said that while all gifts

Muir sophomore Nicole Adams 
won the grand prize - a mountain 
bike donated by UCSD Transpor-
tation and Parking Service . 

After the game, several stu-
dents expressed the desire to see 
UCSD "more spirited" on a regu-
lar basis. 

"More people should break out 
of the mold of everyday life." 
Muir sophomore Jeremy Hughes 
said. 

Yeh added that although the 
competition between the colleges 
was exciti ng,the emphasis hould 
be placed on UCSD as a whole. 

" It was great that Muir.won , 
but [the most important] thing is 
that Spirit Night showed that 
UCSD can have spirit," he said . 
"We had a good taste of the po-
tential tonight." 

are extremely valuable to the uni -
versity, unrestricte9 gi fts are sought 
because they enable the university 
to fund specific areas in need. 

"As agoal , we 've indicated that 
we'd like to beat $75 million ayear 
as soon as possible," .UCSD Assis-
tant Vice Chancellor for Develop-
ment Richard Podgorsk;said. "The 
ways to do that are to increase the 
number of people who know about 
UCSD. and who would be willing 
to support it financi ally." 

Among the nine campuses of 
the UC system. UCSD ranked 
fourth in total gifts received, be-
hind Berkeley. Los Angeles and 
San Francisco. respectively.

Than~s to three fine sports restaurants in San Diego, you 
don't have"to go to Arizona to enjoy the Super Bowl 

11 right, here's the di-
lemma: Next Sunday 

isn't just any Sun-
day; it's Super 

Bowl Sunday . 
The Pittsburgh 

Steelers . The 
Dallas Cow-

boys. The biggest sporting event on 
the planet. You want to watch it, but 
you don't have tickets. 

There's always the tried· and-true 
method of watching the big game 
on your pitiful eight-inch black-and-
white TV. Of course, the screen is 
so minuscule that you can't tell 
whether you're witnessing a foot-
ball contest or a "Gilligan's Island" 
rerun. To make matters worse, your 
bum roommate munched all the 
Doritos and the fridge ins empty as 
Mike Tyson's brain. Football with-
out food is like a book without 
words. 

Outlook - grim. 
All is not lost, however. You see, 

San Diego is home-base to a plethora 
of fine eating establishments . Of 
these restaurants , an elite group 
exists which is not only renowned 
for their tasty food, but also for 

Ie 

their reputation as exciting places 
to watch a ballgame. 

Through keen investigative re-
porting and 'painstaking research, 
the Guardian staff has pinpointed 
some key Super Bowl "hot spots," 
- great venues where one can eat 
and witness Sunday's spectacle. The 
criteria: good food, a pleasant at-
mosphere, close proximity to UCSD 
and, most importantly, at least 10 
television monitors on which to 
watch Sunday's contest. 

Of course, no mere human could 
possibly hope to assimilate this 
myriad of information. Only with 
the help of Elvis, the Guardian 
supercomputer, were we able to sort 
out this extensive data. The names 
of dozens of local eateries and their 
respective info were pro· 
grammed into Elvis, 
which used

selves a sports bar," co-manaaer 
Andrew Marino said. "We're more 
or an eating establishment that has 
lVs." 

Thirteen TVs, specirically, 
enough even ror those who require a 
constant bombardment of nashing 
images depicting bone-jarring, 
mind-numbing gridiron mayhem 
from all angles. or course, the res-
taurant is fully outfitted with stereo 
sound and a satellite dish, as well. 

The Blue Collar also scored ma-
jor points with Elvis thanks 10 its 
two pool tables, which allow pa-
trons to shoot pool during the count-
less commercial timeouts and in-
jury breaks. 

Above all, though, the 
restaurant's fine reputation is built 
on its extensive entree menu which 
reatures more items then you can 

shake a slic:k at. Most popular are 
"Mom's Meatloar," the Cajun 
chicken sandwich and the award-
winning hamburgers. 

Marino'. eatery also found its 
way into Elvis's heart by offering 
12 beers on tap, including 10 
microbrews and two domestic. 

If weather permits, the starr is 
looking to extend their dining room 
outdoors, where even more moni-
tors and additional seating will be 
set up. 
Stuft Pizza 

If owning and managing a great 
place to watch a game and eat 
pizza is an art, then George Hadjis, 
owner of Del Mar's Stuft Pizza, is 
Pablo Picasso. 

"We're an interactive environ-
ment with microbrewed beer and 
award-wi nning pi ZZIS and pastas," 
Hadjis said. "It's a fun place." 

Indeed, this bright, modest res-
taurant features a menu chock-full 
of pizza and pasta 'dishes, all set in 
a heavy sports atmosphere. 

"We get a really big sports tum-

T'he UCSD au.rcun 

out," Hadjis said. 
A lot of that stems rrom its 

collection or 14 monitors - in-
cluding two monstrous 6O-incllers 
which blast stereo sound into ev-
ery nook and eranny of the restau-
rant. 

Also irresistible to the sports 
buff is QV I, the interactive sports 
game in which fans can score 
points by predicting the play-calls 
used in the actual game. 

Stuft leaves the QVI consoles 
out on the bar, and they are quickly 
picked up by patrons on a first-
come, first-serve basis. Monitors 
around the restaurant track each 
players scoring, and you can com-
pare your score with that of other 
football aficionados. 

Stuft Pizza definitely keeps 
UCSD students in mind, as evi-
denced by their "Economy Pizza," 
.a 15-inch, two-topping pizza for 
$6.99. 

"We've been catering to the 
general UCSD population for over 
five years," Hadjis said. "We love 
having them here." 

For the 21 -and-over set, Stufl's 
microbre.w adds another attractive 
element. Hadjis has seen his 
restaurant's beer sales triple since 
introducing the microbrews in late 
October. 

"Ninety-eight percent of our 
beer sold comes from those tanks," 
Hadjis said, referring to the brew 
containers. 

In fact. the beer has become so 
popular that Stuft doesn't carry 
any beer on tap, and stocks only 
boules of Bud and Bud Light. 
Elvis. a beer connoisseur in his 
own right. was especially appre-
ciative of the broad diversity of

"A lot of places that make their 

own beer make a heavier kind."

The result is a variety of ales

Moondoggies of La Jolla can 

be many things during the course 
of a week. Most UCSD students 
are familiar with its Thursday "$2

cited for serving alcohol to

14 FHA 1lJRES 

BOWL: Where 
to find great food for 
the big game 
Continued from ..... 12 
General Manager Michelle 
Higgenbotben said, eliminating 
any lingering doubt. 

That's not hard to believe, con-
sidering the various NFL banners 
and flags ,racing Moondoggies' 
walls and ceiling. Indeed, its sta-
tus as a sports-viewing establish-
ment is indisputable - all sports 
fans need do is take a gander at the 
restaurant's 2] monitors and three 
big screens, and they'll know they 
have found heaven on earth. 

In addition, the two free pool 
tables provide a diversion once 
the AFC invariably gets blown out 
early in the second half. 

Despite these undeniable sport-
bar qualities, though, 
Moondoggies' manager empha-
sizes otber elements. 

"Our theory is that this is a 
restaurant primarily, and we pride 
ourselves on service, (ood, the way 
we treat people, cleanliness and 
maintenance, and not all bars do 
that," Higgenbothen said. "They 
consider themselves a bar or beer 
garden and don't concentrate on 
what's really important, what 
people come back (or." 

The food is popular, partiCUlarly 
the Oriental Chicken salad, the MVP 
pasta and, of course, the burgers. 

Moondoggies also features 23 
beers on tap, which includes three 
domestic and 20 imported or 
microbrews. 

And finally, for those fans who 
want to pretend they are at the 
game, the outdoor patio can help 
provide the illusion, thanks to 
plenty of pleasant outdoor seating 
and even more televisions. 

Regardless of where you spend 
your Sunday, one thing is for sure: 
You don't have to be in Arizona to 
enjoy the Super Bowl festivities.

Tritons Mastered by Mustangs 
CORRALLED: UCSD couldn't overcome The Master's talent in a 110-96 defeat Friday night

Staff Writer 

The toughest competition the Tritons will 
sec this year came to RIMAC Friday for 
"Spirit Night," as UCSD hosted The Master's 

College Mustangs, a perennial 
NAIA powerhouse. 

The Triton's hopes of top-
pling the behemoth Mustangs, 
who are expected to make a 
strong run for the NAIA Na-
tional Championship, were de-
nied,astheMustangswon, I 10-

---- 96. Currently ranked 14th in 
the nation, the Mustangs utilized their tal-
ented shooters and enormous frontline (gar-
nered thanks to the luxury oftheir 13 full-ride 
scholarships). 

The two teams traded leads in the early 
going, while junior center Malt Aune reached 
a UCSD milestone by scoring his I,OOOth 
career point off a pick and roll midway Ihrough 
the first half. Aune, UCSO's leading scorer 
and rebounder, scored 18 points and pulled 
down eight boards.

the meet by a score of 14] -131. 

"I told the guys after the meet 
that I couldn't have been happier 
with the way they swam [Satur-
day]," Boyd said. "It was the best 
meet we've had all year from top to 
bottom." 

r 

s 

son to be encouraged by his team's perfor-
mance. 

"We played more pressure defense in this 
game than we have the rest of this year," he 
said. "We' vedecided that' s the direction we're 
going to head in. [The Master's] turned the 
ball over 25 limes, I'm going to guess that's 
a season high for them." 

The Tritons' swarming defense kept them 
in the game by forcing turnovers and creating 
numerous scoring opportunities. Personnel 
changes and constant pressure seemed to con-
fuse and frustrale the Mustangs. 

Just before the half-time buzzer, UCSO 
pulled to within four points, 5]-47, on a re-
bound and tip-in by sophomore guard Jason 
Jones, who came off the bench to spark a late, 
first-half Triton run. 

Jones and shooting guard Jason Barnes 
returned from injuries to record some impres-
sive offensive numbers against the Mustangs. 
Jones finished with 12 points, while Barnes 
scored] I. 

"More than anything, we had two more 
able bodies that allowed us to rest our other 
players," Lanthier said. "When your players 

• 

r e y 

get tired, they drop down in the level of play." 
UCSD was forced to play catch-up for 

most of the second half, tying the Mustangs 
several times, only to have The Master's shoot-
ers step up to reclaim the lead with perimeter 
jumpers. 

"The bollom line is that Mike Penberthy is 
the best player that we'll ever see on the 
floor," Lanthier said of the Mustangs' 6'3" 
junior guard. . 

Penberthy finished with 33 points, most of 
which came from his seven three-pointers. 

The Tritons kept pace with The Master's 
until the final five minutes of the contest, 
when a 13-3 Mllstang run - sparked by the 
three-point shooting of Penberthy and senior 
Mitt Kordik - closed the door on UCSD. 

"I think that we ran out of gas," Lanthier 
said. "You can step up your game and sustain 
it for a certain amount of time. We gave ' 
everything we had, it just wasn't good enough 
for 40 minutes." . 

UCSO was able to get a number of late 
looks at three-point shots, but they didn't fall . 

The Tritons look to improve their 7-10 
record as they entertain Menlo College Satur-

UCSO's women, inconlrast, had 
no trouble finishing off the opposi-
tion from CMS. Notable swims for 
the Tritons included freshmen Kristi 
Jordan's 1:03.99 in, the 100 back-
stroke, which complemented the 
first-place swim of senior Carrie 
Parker in the same event. 

Sarah Chu's 1:08.93 in the 100 
breaststroke earned first place, as 
did fellow freshmen Kelly Byrne's 
2:2B8 in the 200 breast. 

friday, january 26, 1 96 

The trio of Kristen Kemmer, 
Parker and Jordan stormed the field 
in the 200 backstroke, all tallying 
quick times paced by 'Parker's 
2:12.13. Byrne and Kemmer both 
reappeared later in the meet to post 
strong times of ] :02.94 and ] :02.57 
in the 100 butterfly, respecti vely. 
The final two-time speedster was 
Monroe, who made her second im-
pressive showing in the 400 indi-
vidual medley with a timeof4:45.45 . 

"The girls swam fantastic as 
usual," Boyd said. "Right now, eight 
of our 14 are qualified for NCAAs, 
but they all have a chance. Confer-
ence is where we'll try to qualify the 
rest of them."

Tritons Occi-cute the Tigers, 80-68 
PERFECT 10: UCSD captures its 10th victory (with only four defeats) by topping Occidental 
By Robin Kurian 
SUI" Writer 

Suddenly the pressure is now 
on the UCSO women's basket-
ball team. After decisively win-

ning their last two 
contests and ex-
tending their record 
to 9-4 last week, the 
Tritons have be-
come the team to 
beat. 

"Everyone'sjust 
waiting to reach up 

and snap us," Triton forward Karli 
Jungwirth said. 

Jungwirth and the UCSO 
women, however, seemed unat-
fected by front-runner jitters 
against Occidental College on Fri-
day night:t RIMAC Arena, notch-
ing victory number 10 by a score 
of 80-68. 

The Tigers, whose 2-12 record 
is not representative of their level 
of play, rallied behind the speed

Celaya proved no less impres-

points, including four of six from

The Tigers' one-woman team, 
however, was no match for UCSO' s 
commanding defense, solid offense 
and deep bench. The Triton tag-
team post players Sarah Schneider, 
Anne Westmoreland, Tianna Mi-
rage and Jungwirth proved stron-
ger and quicker than their Tiger 
counterparts. 

Westmoreland, who boasts the 
highest scoring average on the 
team, tallied 10 points and seven

CAP: How much 
cash can you spend? 
ContInued from pac. 20 

The salary cap needs some 
enforcement - not to mention ad-
justment - by league officials. 

What the salary caps have proved, 
so far, is that tearns can mortgage 
their futures in order to "Just win, 
baby." 

Look at the Los Angeles Lakers. 
They promised balloon payments to 
Magic Johnson and James Worthy 
in an effort to smooth contract nego-
tiations during the I 980s. The result 
is that long after both jerseys have 
been retired, the Lakers are still fi-
nancially burdened with huge re-
ward payments to the "showtime"-
era icons. 

The salary cap was initiated to 
help small-market franchises stay 
competiti ve with the mega-bucks of 
major metropolitan cities. But, aJas, 
i! seems to me that the learns in 
large-market areas are still wiMing. 
They are still blowing out the little 
guys while flaunting revenues which 
extend far beyond those reaped from 
ticket sales or TV. They bring in 
talent with large payouts that some-
how don't fall under the league-
imposed salary "ceiling." 

Now, you're probably asking 
what you, as a sports fan - and if 
you've followed me this far, you're 
a true diehard - can do to help. 
Well, let me offer a little bit of 
advice which aJ~ays seems to work 
forme: Root for the underdogs. They 
just might win.

Cowboys Take 
Cap Off to Deion 

The uJary cap is IUppos-
edly the maximum amount a 
profeuioaal team can pay its 
p1ayen over the coune of a 
season. It was designed to 
introcluc:e parity to leapes 
dominalod by media moguls 
and corporate conglomerates. 
Lately, it seems that big 
busineu baa found ways to 
circumvent these rules, 
discovering means to load their 
rosten with the fineat athletes 
in the world. 

Did the Dallas Cowboys 
purchase their way into the 
Super Bowl? 

'Fint, Cowboys owner Jerry 
Jones decided he wanted to be 
buddy-buddy with Nike, 
perhapl the most successful 
sports-merchandise company' 
ever, 1ater declaring a partner-
ship aimed at luring one of its 
hottest spokesmen to his half-
domed playing field. 

Yes, I'm talking about the 
flamboyant, egocentric and 
extremely talented Deion 
Sandtn. 

For the record (because this 
is my fint column), let me give 
you a little bit of insight into 
my own personal biases. I'm 
not a Dallas Cowboys fan. I'm 
from the Bay Area, but I like 
the Steelers. I also like the ... 
um ... Seahawks. 

Realizing now that my 
credibility is all but lost, let me 
add that I sympathize with all 
you sports fans who wanted to 
see the 4gers make it to the 
NFC Championship Game. 
They would have trounced 
Dallas in Cowboyland; the 
Packen did the Cowboys a 
hup Favre-or by beating the 
big boy. from Frisco. 

Regardless, football just 
seemed to lose some of its 
appeal when the 'Niners were 

u~remoniously ousted. 
lnat~ of rooting for, or 
against, the reigning world 
cham.,., we get to watch the 
rich VI. richer, the blue-collar 
work eIbic: vs. white-collar 
financial manipulation. 

So, if you propose that there 
was no underhandedness

Deion deal, anawer me this:

By Den KnIt 
Sports Editor 

With only three weeks remain-
ing until the conference champi-
onships, Saturday's dual meet with 

the united schools of 
Claremont-Mudd-

the "'rito05' last im-

While the men 
were not expected to 
challenge the Stals,

vored to control their h.1f of the 
meet. But everything turned up 
roses for UCSD, as the men nar-
rowly missed upsetting eMS and 
the women looked as good as ad-
vertised in their dominating vic-
tory.
