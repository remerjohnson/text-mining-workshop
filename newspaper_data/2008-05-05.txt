All classes will be taught in 
English, with some basic instruc-
tion in the native language pro-
vided to help students navigate 
through the community to travel 
and meet with locals during their 
spare time.

Galvin said that a distinct advan-

ing 1,139 national companies were 
estimating an 8-percent increase 
— a slight decline from the ear-
lier estimate, but still an overall 
expansion in job opportunities for 
upcoming graduates, according to 
Director of Communications for the 
National Association of Colleges 
and Employers Mimi Collins. 

The survey, compiled by NACE, 
includes larger businesses with 
established recruiting programs 
that have an interest in hiring recent 
graduates.

Special emphasis has been placed 
on the types of careers graduates are 
planning to pursue. The finance 
area will feel the burden of the eco-
nomic slump, so job opportunities 
within this sector may be harder 
to obtain. The economic crunch 
has already caused damage in the 
student lending division, taking a 
toll on the majority of financially 
dependent students.

An Inside Look: Photo Editor Will Parson takes his audio 
slideshow to the Earth Day Trash Sort Extravaganza.

By Serena Renner
Associate Focus Editor

Partnered with the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, UCSD 
has spent the last half-century as a 
front-runner in the world’s under-
standing of climate science. Today, 
the campus strives to continue this 
tradition by becoming a leader in 
renewable energy use and by serving 
as a testing ground for global-warm-
ing solutions.

SIO entered the climate-change 
game in 1957, when Roger Revelle 
and colleague Hans Suess discovered 
that oceans cannot absorb unlimited 
amounts of carbon dioxide.

This finding disproved the widely 
held belief that excess carbon dioxide 
would be consumed by the Earth’s 
expanse of oceans. Instead, it was

evidence that human gas emissions 
would enhance what would be later 
coined the “greenhouse effect,” lead-
ing to a warming climate over time. 

Charles David Keeling, who 
worked under Revelle, put this theory 
to the test. Keeling became the first 
person to ever measure the rising 
atmospheric carbon dioxide in what’s 
known as the “Keeling curve.” 

With Revelle and Keeling as fore-
fathers, UCSD was born into the cra-
dle of climate-change understanding. 
Now, 50 years later, the campus aims 
to put knowledge into practice by 
becoming the leading user of renew-
able energy at any college campus in 
the nation.

With graduation approaching, 
the UCSD class of 2008 and nation-
al employers are preparing for a 
flood of applications in a job mar-
ket that has begun to shrink due to 
the country’s economic crisis. This 
year, more than two million stu-
dents will graduate with a bachelor’s 
or master’s degree. 

In a study conducted at the 
beginning of this year, employers 
expected to hire 16 percent more 
college graduates than they did 
last year. However, the national 
Job Outlook 2008 Spring Update 
survey showed that the participat-

interact with both the faculty and 
each other. 

“It’s a great opportunity for 
students to have close one-on-one 
instruction with faculty,” Galvin 
said.

Each seminar is comprised 
of two classes for a total of eight 
UCSD units over the program’s five-
week period.

With a dismal $200 return, 
All-Campus Senator Amie Scott 
explained her efforts to raise money 
for San Diego County wildfire vic-
tims.

“What we raised was a lot lower 
than I expected,” Scott said. “What 
is good though is that we raised 
the awareness of a lot of students 
who did not realize that there are 
still individuals and families who 
are homeless or [have] lost every-
thing.”

This year’s restructured council 
added eight all-campus and five 
academic senatorial positions. The 
work accomplished by senators like 
Taylor and Scott is a litmus test of 
the magnitude of success that these 
changes had. 

Though microphones were set in 
front of the stage, poised for audi-
ence members to start discussion 
about individual senator projects,

Budget Deficit a Hot Topic at State Capitol 
See ADDRESS, page 3

By Smruti Aravind
Senior Staff Writer

Leaders from California’s three pub-
lic college systems met at the nation’s 
capitol last week to lobby policymak-
ers in a campaign against Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s proposed budget 
cuts to higher education and its threats 
to greater academic opportunities.

California Community Colleges 
Chancellor Diane Woodruff, 
California State University Chancellor 
Charles Reed, University of California 

accomplished has molded UCSD 
for the generations to come.”

Campus senators, some of whom 
served in new positions created by 
the 2006-07 A.S. Council, spoke 
enthusiastically about their respec-
tive senatorial projects, which were 
met with both success and failure. 

Engineering Senator Jordan 
Taylor, one of the council’s first 
academic senators, helped build 
camaraderie between engineering 
students by organizing barbecue 
events during the 10th week of each 
quarter.

“Two hundred people showed 
up for the first barbecue,” Taylor 
said. “I received positive comments 
from a lot of students, who felt that 
their major limited social interac-
tion.”

Over 500 people attended 
Taylor’s Winter Quarter barbecue 
and the event is expected to bring in 
an even greater number of students 
this quarter. 

President Robert C. Dynes and UC 
Provost Rory Hume are also appearing 
on radio shows and major editorial 
boards across the state — including 
the Sacramento Bee, San Francisco 
Chronicle, Los Angeles Times and, 
later this week, the San Diego Union-
Tribune.

The unprecedented meetings 
emphasize to policymakers and the 
public the magnitude of the pro-
posed cuts and the harm they will 
cause California, UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz said. 

Decreased funding will result in 
fewer Cal Grants for needy students. 
Additionally, Dynes sent UC students 
a notice last week informing them of 
a possible 7-percent increase in educa-
tional fees and a 10-percent increase in 
registration fees. 

Consequently, students relying on 
the state grants may not be able to 
attend the university, which could lead 
to a change in the composition of the 
nine-campus system, Schwartz said.

Biologists Join National 
Academy of Sciences
Two faculty members from the 

division of biological sciences 
were elected this week for mem-
bership in the National Academy 
of Sciences, which is considered 
one of the highest honors for U.S. 
scientists and engineers. 

Dean of the Division of 
Biological Sciences Steve A. Kay 
and Chair of the Section of Cell 
and Developmental Biology Martin 
F. Yanofsky were among the 72 
new members and 18 foreign asso-
ciates appointed to the academy, 
which was founded by Congress 
in 1863 to serve as an adviser to 
the federal government on issues 
of science and technology.

Kay and Yanofsky, both of 
whom are plant biologists, join 14 
other professors of biological sci-
ences in the National Academy’s 
membership. Five of the profes-
sors are members of the acade-
my’s plant biology section.

“Plant biology is gaining 
increased importance in the world 
today with our growing need to 
develop novel approaches to solv-
ing the world’s food crisis and to 
find ways to beat the high prices 
at the pump and meet our future 
energy needs through the devel-
opment of new biofuels,” Kay said 
in a statement. “Our leadership in 
this area and in many other fields 
of biological sciences make me 
confident that we have the scien-
tific talent here at UC San Diego to 
make great strides in addressing 
the nation’s and the world’s future 
needs in health, food produc-
tion and the development of new 

sources of renewable energy.”

Scripps to Send Life-
Detecting Robot to Mars

Researchers at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography have 
received approximately $2 million 
in NASA funding for the flight 
planning and design of a new life-
probing instrument in preparation 
for a mission to Mars.

The Urey: Mars Organic and 
Oxidant Detector was developed 
by a scientist at the institution 
and named after the late Nobel 
Laureate and UCSD scholar 
Harold C. Urey. The instrument, 
which is the first to have the abili-
ty to differentiate between Martian 
materials produced by biological 
and nonbiological processes, will 
search for key classes of organic 
molecules on the red planet using 
state-of-the-art analytical meth-
ods at part-per-million sensitivi-
ties.

Professor of marine chemistry 
at Scripps Jeffrey Bada, and a 
multinational research team have 
designed an investigation using 
the Urey instrument to detect signs 
of past or present life on Mars 
for the European Space Agency’s 
2013 ExoMars Rover Mission. The 
instrument will study Martian rock 
and soil samples provided by the 
ExoMars Rover for organic mol-
ecules and amino acids. 

“This next phase of funding 
assures that the Urey instrument’s 
design will be completed on 
schedule and we will be prepared 
to start building the actual instru-
ment next year,” Bada said in a 
statement.

no such debate took place. 
Instead, A.S. vice presidents took 

the stage to thank councilmem-
bers who helped in their efforts, 
and gave words of wisdom to the 
incoming officers, most of whom  
held positions on this year’s A.S. 
Council.

A.S. President-elect Donna Bean, 
who served as A.S. Vice President 
of Student Life this year, spoke con-
fidently about the council’s restruc-
turing.

In addition, Bean delivered a 
lengthy thank-you to officers and 
senators who supported her work. 
Bean’s administrative counterpart, 
UCSD Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Penny Rue, sat quietly in the 
audience throughout the event. 

The last vice presidential speech, 
delivered by VP of External Affairs 
Dorothy Young, moved the audience 
when she revealed the results of a 
voter registration campaign that she 
helped oversee. In total, 1,651 UCSD 
students registered to vote during 
the California primary, showing a 
spark in student political interest that 
Young said has been unseen on cam-
pus before. 

After the speakers exited the 
stage, Murillo closed the event with 
an inspirational speech centered on 
his belief in the importance of com-
munity at UCSD.

“The addition of new senatorial 
offices among other things are to 
improve this campus for its 20,000-
plus students,” Murillo said. “It has 
been my personal mission to enhance 
community at UCSD.”

The UC system is currently over-
enrolled by 4,000 students, and an esti-
mated 27,000 students will be denied 
entrance into the CSU and UC systems 
over the next two and half years.

“We have an obligation to take 
a certain percentage of eligible high 
school graduates,” Schwartz said. “If 
that number keeps growing, we need 
to accept more people. If we don’t 
receive public support we won’t be able 
to meet the obligation.” 

Gov. Schwarzenegger proposed 
a 10-percent cut 
in funding to 
public educa-
tion institutions 
earlier this year 
in response to a 
$14-billion state 
deficit, which has 
since increased 
to about $20 bil-
lion.

“A few years 
ago, we had our 
budget cut by 
half a billion,” 
CSU spokesman 
Paul Browning 
said. “We’re still rebounding from 
that. Now we’re facing another $386-
million cut. If the budget is passed, 
we will need to look at campuses on 
an individual basis.”

Browning added that shortfalls 
in funding would have wide-reach-
ing consequences, especially for future 
enrollment.

“We might need to cut part-time 
faculty,” he said. “That’s what usu-
ally happens: cut student employees, 
cut curriculums and courses offered 
and raise the number of students in 
each class. It will hurt us culturally as 
well, because CSU supplies the most 
degrees for minorities, who are our 

future.”
The CSU system is the largest four-

year institution in the country, enroll-
ing approximately 450,000 students 
and employing about 445,000 faculty 
members.

Almost 10,000 qualified students 
were rejected this year when the CSU 
system closed the application dead-
line immediately after the cuts were 
proposed. 

Browning identified a “trickle-
down effect” in which students who 
are unable to get into a UC school 

will turn to the 
CSU system, and 
those turned away 
will look to the 
California commu-
nity colleges, which 
are also facing a 
significant short-
fall in funds. He 
also acknowledged 
the University of 
California’s obli-
gation to expand 
so that the system 
can absorb future 
increases in enroll-
ment.

“Students will be left out in the 
cold,” Browning said. “Some will have 
to postpone their education, which 
could be disastrous.” 

According to Browning, cutting 
from California’s education system 
may hurt the economy as well. For 
every dollar the state invests in the 
CSU system, CSU puts $4.41 back 
into the state. For the UC system, that 
figure is about $6. 

While the CSU system would face a 
$386-million cut, the UC system is up 
against a $425-million shortfall.

tage the Global Seminars provide 
over other study abroad programs 
is that they do not require students 
to commit to a whole quarter away 
from home.

“It may be the case that students 
have a responsibility here,” he said, 
noting that students may not be able 
to leave their families for long periods 
of time due to special circumstances.

Some students may have a rigor-
ously structured major that doesn’t 
allow them to take extra classes they 
may like to take during the school year, 
Galvin explained. Global Seminars 
allow them to take such classes.

Cost can be another issue pre-
venting students from making a 
long-term study abroad commit-
ment. Since Global Seminars is only 
five weeks, it is less expensive than 
year- and semester-long programs.

Galvin also said the Global 
Seminars program will help build 
the confidence of apprehensive stu-
dents, and could inspire them to 
take a longer study abroad opportu-
nity in the future.

Director of Eleanor Roosevelt 
College’s Making of the Modern 
World Program Matthew Herbst, 
who will be a professor at the Paris 
seminar, said he feels that the Global 
Seminars program gives professors a 
distinct advantage in teaching.

“It’s something that we can’t do 
in La Jolla,” he said.

Herbst said he chose Paris 
because it provides a unique oppor-
tunity to teach his students about 
everything going on in the world 
during certain time periods.

“I had to think of a city that not 
only gave a history of one place but 

also the world,” he said, citing the 
East Asian and African art that can 
be found in Paris’ Louvre museum.

Although the program is orga-
nized by UCSD’s International 
Center, the faculty has a significant 
part in deciding the locales chosen 
for the program.

The process starts in the 
International Center, where a list of 
locations around the world are gath-

ered and forwarded to faculty mem-
bers. Faculty members then submit 
their proposals for places and class-
es, which are voted on by a commit-
tee at the International Center.

Global Seminars will cost stu-
dents $5,000 to $8,000, depending 
on the program. However, all forms 
of financial aid — including federal, 
state and UCSD aid — still apply, 
and the International Center also 
plans to award scholarships.

Plans for Global Seminars 2009 
are already underway, and some 
professors already have an idea of 
where they want to go even beyond 
next year.

“I’ll be proposing one for 
Istanbul,” Herbst said. “The goal 
for 2010’s MMW will be to have a 
program in either South America 
or Africa.”

Galvin said the list of seminars 
for summer 2009 should be avail-
able by Fall Quarter 2008,

“We have locations on six conti-
nents,” he said. “What we’re looking 
for is faculty members wanting to go 
places we haven’t been.”

Galvin said he is hoping profes-
sors will propose trips to new places 
such as Africa, Australia, Eastern 
Europe and Asia.

Rajakumar at nrajakum@ucsd.edu.

“The goal for 2010’s MMW will be to have a program in either South America or

“The important thing is to keep 
an open mind and be flexible — it’s 
your first job, but it’s not going to 
be your only job,” Collins said. “You 
probably won’t get your dream job 
at first, so look at it as a stepping 
stone.”

Especially in California, those 
interested in teaching at public 
schools will feel the negative impli-
cations of the state’s budget cuts to 
education. 

Technological areas like engi-
neering and computer science, on 
the other hand, will either remain 
stable or see an increase in demand 
for employees. 

Senior general biology major 
Zachary Shore has his apprehen-
sions about whether he’s prepared 
for his post-college job search, but 
his field of study falls conveniently 
with the ecological interests and 

research-based history of La Jolla. 
Although the number of employ-

ers who came to the campus’ job 
fairs decreased by roughly 10 per-
cent, Director of UCSD’s Career 
Services Center Andrew Ceperley 
remains optimistic about the health 
of the job market for upcoming col-
lege graduates. 

“We’re finding that opportuni-
ties are still plentiful and that stu-
dents who are very resourceful and 
establish important connections 
tend to do well,” Ceperley said. 
“And especially during a downturn 
of the economy, it really separates 
the resourceful seeker from the 
[average] seeker who’s just looking 
for a job from an online posting.”

Talk of economic recession, 
delayed employers’ reactions to the 
economic downturn and the unpre-
dictability of future market pros-
perity may give the class of 2009 a 

harder time landing a job than this 
spring’s alumni.  

Yet despite the economic slump 
and the minor decline in employ-
ment opportunities, both recruiters 
and students hold a positive out-
look on the future of the job mar-
ket. The majority of UCSD students 
can also find networking opportu-
nities and connections with people 
in their professions of interest. 

“The demand for biology grad-
uates seems high now, especially 
with all the research and develop-
ment going toward biotechnology 
[and] conservation issues,” Shore 
said. “San Diego is so rich with 
science-related companies — I may 
not be able to find my ideal career, 
but I do feel that at least … a job 
[is] out there for me.”

Online Shoppers Enter Dangerous Dreamland of  Random Kitsch
I’ve never been a big shopper— fashion just doesn’t interest me — but when I recently dis-
covered eBay.com it was like heroin 
in auction-Web site form. I was a late 
player of the Internet-shopping game:
I had known about eBay but it wasn’t 
until my roommate introduced me 
to all its kitschy wonder that I actu-
ally visited the site. With millions 
of objects conveniently categorized 
and subcategorized for super-easy 
browsing, eBay can be dangerous. It’s 
like Wikipedia.org — you get sucked 
in looking for something relatively 
harmless and when you finally resur-
face two hours later, all you have 
to show is a nuanced knowledge of 
Colin Meloy, the Fuhrerbunker and 
antique typewriters — except with 
eBay, you’re out $40 and are now 

excess stock up on the site, Half.com 
often has brand-new textbooks for a 
fraction of the UC Regents’ price.

In fact, with sites like Craigslist.
com, Overstock.com and even 
Facebook, you basically never need 

expecting a typewriter in the mail.
But once you’re able to recognize 

its dangerous potential, the bargains 
Internet shopping provides can be 
pretty glorious — after all, that’s what 
attracted me to it in the first place. 
Where, other than eBay, are you 
going to find biographies of Johnny 
Cash, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jackie 
O all starting for just a penny? 

And eBay isn’t the only place to 
find such awesome deals. Little-broth-
er site Half.com is another great place 
to find cheap books — particularly 
textbooks — as long as you can keep 
a focused, level head throughout the 
buying experience. Why waste money 
at the UCSD Bookstore, when you 
could get your books much cheaper 
on the Internet? Plus, because many 
smaller bookstores will put their 

to buy things at full price ever again. 
While eBay is like a cool vintage-

object mecca, Craigslist is more like 
a sneak peek into every garage sale 
in your neighborhood; it takes a little 
more searching, but sometimes you 
hit gold. And because the listings are 
in your area, you don’t have to pay 
shipping, which can often double the 
purchasing price, like on eBay. Plus, on 
Craigslist you can also adopt pets, look 
for jobs and laugh about the hilarious 
“missed connections” (listings from 
this weekend include “Agent Orange--
you got me water” and “Hot Guy at Mr. 
taco”). But because it has much more 
of a garage-sale vibe, Craigslist items 
are often obviously secondhand. I say, 
embrace this fact and check out the 
free section to furnish your pad in true 
college fashion — with mismatched See SHOES, page 5

Stealing
the Shoes

The $4 Question

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — Last week marked 
one of life’s important milestones. I skipped 
a short shift at work, figuring the cost of gas 
driving there wasn’t worth what I’d get back 
from my paycheck. Reaping three hours at 
$10-per-hour is made intensely distasteful 
when one of those hours alone is the price of 
admission — to your own job.

Now, employees at any clock-in-clock-out 
job have seen gas costs become an increas-
ingly large determining factor in something 
we should all want untouchable: lifestyle. 
College-age folk, being the U.S. economy’s 
most practiced nickel-and-dimers, are finding 
themselves nickel-and-dimed at the pump to 
the point of questioning: Do I want to pay the 
cost of what it takes to hang with friends? To 
get pizza? To go to class?

The paralyzing impact of the pump on 
today’s everyday choices is a commentary so 
sad that its become the latest hot topic of the 
elections season. At question is a proposal that 
would suspend the federal gas tax during for 
three months during summer. Presidential 
candidates and Sens. Hilary Clinton (D-N.Y.), 
Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and John McCain (R-

Ariz.) are using the pocketbook plan as the 
battleground over the proposal’s total effec-
tiveness and — predictably — what each can-
didate’s opinion of the plan means about their 
campaign.

For working students like me, the faster 
help can come, the better. That would put 
McCain and Clinton in my corner. But I also 
hope to continue driving for a long time. That 
would put me in the Obama camp, which is 
branding the plan as a short-term, ineffective 
way of attacking a problem that, at this rate, 
will put us all out of house and home, and 
onto bicycles.

So for wallet-wary students like me, inun-
dated by an elections season that has scruti-
nized candidate’s every nook from flag lapels 
to cried tears, the relation of gas costs to 
respective campaigns isn’t pressing — I just 
need to get the problem dealt with, and soon.

Major-chain stations are sucking even more 
life from the wallet by limiting the use of credit 
cards on regular unleaded gas. It forces driv-
ers to always have cash on hand, a thoroughly 
inconvenient and sometimes impossible skill 
to master for the working class. The economic 
caste, home to penny pinchers and coupon 
clippers, is losing out the most. 

Case in point for yours truly: The 40-cent 

upgrade originally meant for my super-sized 
meal is instead going toward the cost of gas. 
Forgot cash? That’s another 10-cent difference, 
so filling up my 11-gallon car means at least 
paying a dollar more. That’s a whole chicken 
sandwich, medium fries and the acclaimed 69-
cent XL drink funneled into my tank. 

Sure, it’s a rather narrow take on the impact 
of a complex, long-standing problem on the 
common citizen. But consider that the com-
mon driver fills up their tank at least once a 
week and is paying at least $10 more total; the 
problem compounds because not everyone has 
$40 to spare every month. 

So as a political move, it would be wise 
to ride this bandwagon. What better way 
to get to voters than through their wallets? 
Clinton has championed her plan to throw 
the produced shortfall on oil companies via 
specialized taxes. It’s a savory prospect (stick it 
to the man!), but moves us no closer to a long-
term solution. Political concentration on U.S. 
dependence on oil and research into sustain-
ability and environmentally friendly practices 
are the only big-picture approaches to getting 
gouged at the pump.

of the exact things you’re probably 
looking for: beds, bookshelves and 
desks, mainly from IKEA.

Yes, though Facebook Marketplace 
can provide possibly the best online 
shopping experi-
ence — a micro-
cosm of things 
you’re looking 
for, being sold 
cheaply and

is clearly season-
al. But this, too, 
you can use to 
your advantage. 

This brings 
me to my final 
discovery: Overstock.com. I know, 
I know, the commercials are ridic-
ulous, and like eBay I had never 
seriously considered visiting the site 
until someone showed me the error 
of my ways. It was Winter Quarter 

and I was freezing in the harsh La

to keep me warm. But alas, it was 
January, which means winter wear 
was out as stores made room for 
their new spring lines. This is when 

my mom men-
tioned Overstock.

was able to find a 
really nice, warm 
jacket.

Sure, I’m 
still awed by 
the diversity of 
eBay’s options 
— every time 
I visit it shows 
me something 
I never knew I 
needed — but all 

the auction stuff can get hazard-

of awesome Internet bargains out 
there waiting for you just as you

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

By Joanna Cardenas
Staff Writer

Every morning at 5 a.m., Cecilia Ubilla 
wakes up and prepares an authentic cup 
of Argentinean matte in silent meditation. 
Wearing a heavy overcoat and toting her signa-
ture African wicker basket, she walks a couple 
blocks to the bus stop and takes the Route 48 
bus to campus. When lecturing, Ubilla heads 
to her classroom to review and prepare. When 
she isn’t, she heads to her small office on the 
third floor of Center Hall — a room filled with 
books, files and the faint scent of fresh flowers. 
Whatever she does, she reinforces it with a life’s 
worth of insight.

Ubilla’s tumultuous past is masked well 
behind her quiet and modest daily routine. 
Today, Ubilla relishes her positions as guest 
lecturer for the latin american studies depart-
ment and language and writing program coor-
dinator for the Office of Academic Support 
and Instructional Services. But nearly 35 years 

ago, Ubilla was captured, imprisoned and sen-
tenced to death for her revolutionary involve-
ment prior to the military coup of the Salvador 
Allende regime in Chile.

Born into a working-class family in the 
hills of central Chile in 1934, Ubilla’s politi-
cal awareness developed early on. She began 
to understand the injustices present in Chile 
at age 14, when she accompanied her father 
to reluctantly ask his employer for money to 
send her and her sisters to school. Her father’s 
request was denied and Ubilla was, instead, 
offered a job as a maid. 

“I remember my father being silent, but 
extremely humiliated by that because of the 
response and also because he was in front of 
his eldest daughter,” Ubilla said. “Something 
became very clear to me … there was no rea-
son why my parents should work so very hard 
only to have nothing.”

Determined to attend college so that she 
could use her education the way her parents 
urged — to help those without opportunity 

— Ubilla attended the School of Letters and 
Philosophy at the University of Chile where 
she double majored in French and edu-
cation. As a college student, she was 
able to successfully marry her love of 
education with her love of politics, 
participating in anti-war protests 
as well as demonstrations about 
the welfare of the less fortu-
nate. 

“[Being a student in 
Chile] is the time when 
you are an idealist and 
you believe the world 
can be better,” Ubilla 
said. “Many people 
stay like that for the 
rest of their lives. 
As a woman from 
the third world, I 
would like to still

planting them in our own backyard 
to reap the benefits while also func-
tioning as stewards of the Earth,” 
said Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary 
Matthews in an e-mail.

To accomplish the goal, UCSD 
plans to generate 10 to 15 percent of 
its annual energy needs from renew-
able sources, including solar panels, 
hydrogen fuel cells and wind farms. 

The campus has already signed 
a contract to install one megawatt 
worth of photovoltaic solar panels, 
Matthews said. One megawatt could 
power 300 homes. The solar energy 
will come from 26 array systems that 
will start popping up on several cam-
pus roofs, including RIMAC, Price 
Center and Hopkins and Gilman 

p ark -
ing struc-

tures this May. The current project is 
scheduled for completion in January 
2009, and the university is looking 
to add an additional megawatt in 
subsequent years.

Two arrays are already installed 
atop the Powell Structures Lab and 
the Rady School of Management, 
campus Energy and Utilities Manager 
John Dilliott said.

However, these structures only 
provide 30 kilowatts of electricity, 
according to the Association for the 
Advancement of Sustainability in 
Higher Education Web site, com-
pared with a new 250-killowatt sys-
tem at UC San Francisco and a 2.6-
megawatt installation at the Contra 
Costa Community College District, 
which is the largest on any col-

lege campus in the United 
States.
“We have big plans but 

right now we only have two small 
systems,” Dilliott said.

UC Irvine signed a similar con-
tract shortly before UCSD, also dedi-
cated to producing one megawatt 
of energy from solar installations 
on rooftops, said Andrew Coghlan, 
a sustainability specialist for the 
University of California Office of the 
President. 

According to Dilliott, however, 
most new renewable energy will 
come from fuel cells, which will be 
powered by waste methane released 
at the Point Loma sewage treatment 
plant. UCSD plans to install two 
1.2-megawatt hydrogen fuel cells to 
power the east campus, while also 
utilizing recycled methane to help 
run the campus cogeneration plant, 
which currently burns natural gas to 
heat, cool and light the campus.

Additionally, the university plans 
to purchase up to three megawatts 
of wind power from Southern 

California wind farms, Matthews 
said.

If all plans are enacted, 7.4 mega-
watts of the university’s electrical 
load will be offset by renewable 
sources. This quantity is enough to 
power 2,100 homes annually while 
also reducing carbon dioxide emis-
sions by 10,000 to 15,000 tons — the 
equivalent of taking 1,500 cars off 
the road, according to Matthews. 

The UC system as a whole aims to 
produce 10 megawatts of renewable 
energy onsite by 2014. While not all 
of UCSD’s energy will be generated 
on campus, the initiative will break 
substantial ground in achieving the 
systemwide goal, Coghlan said.

UCSD may become the renew-
able-energy leader in the near future, 
with UCLA currently at the fore-
front for renewable energy produc-
tion in the UC system, according to 
Coghlan. UCLA also has a cogenera-
tion system to self-produce campus

As the sun rose slowly over the mountains, the snap and flash of more than 100 cameras 
filled the small peak. My camera was 
among them, capturing the progression 
of the sun in the trip it makes every day, 
documenting a moment that was not 
only captured a thousand times that 
morning but had been witnessed by 
millions of religious missionaries, pil-
grims and tourists 
for centuries. I usu-
ally mock tourism 
at every chance, 
but as I focus my 
camera on the top 
of Mount Sinai, I 
tread the same 
roads. 

A week later 
my camera was put to use on another 
mountain, or rather hill, right outside 
of downtown Cairo. There were far 
less tourists — none, in fact — but the 
connection between Mount Sinai and 
Mokattam Hills is not such a stretch. 
The story of Moses places him at the 
peak of Mount Sinai collecting God’s 
commandments and the story of Simon 
the Tanner describes him moving 
the mountain at Mokattam after the 
Christian community of Cairo prayed 
and fasted for three days in the year 972 
B.C. When I entertain guests in Cairo I 
like to take them there because it gar-
ners scarce coverage in guidebooks and 
is rarely visited. Tour buses never park 
at the bottom of Mokattam Mountain.

Religion’s power to motivate tour-
ism is apparent in Sinai, even among 
the secular. More and more attention 
has been given to Mokattam Hill’s 
Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner, 
cut into the mountainside a millenium 
after the legend of Simon’s feat and 
often presented as the largest church 
in the Middle East. The hills above the 
Coptic Christian community known 
to foreigners as Garbage City could, 
on any given day, be filled with flocks 
of religious missionaries, pilgrims and 

tourists.
Back in Sinai, as the sun made its full 

presence known, I turned my camera to 
the wave of people slowly descending 
Mount Sinai’s peak. The hundreds of 
sightseers who had begun their ascent 
three to four hours earlier had appeared 
like a constellation of bobbing flashlights 
and headlamps weaving up the moun-
tain where God informed Moses “covet-

ing thy neighbor’s 
wife,” among 
other things, was 
quite taboo. And 
now, after having 
arrived at the peak, 
watched the sun 
rise and snapped a 
few quick photos 
as evidence of their 

great journey, the mob of religious and 
profane alike headed down to the base. 
There they would wander through the 
monastery of St. Catherine and gaze 
upon the distant relative of a burning 
bush before hopping back in their buses 
to the nearby beach resort towns of 
Dahab and Sharm Al-Sheikh. 

On April 27, the Coptic Easter, I 
headed to the Monastery of St. Simon. 
The cab driver, a Muslim, knew the 
church and we entered Garbage City 
— named so because the Christian 
community living there collects, sorts 
and recycles a large part of Cairo’s refuse 
in the ground level space below their 
homes, next to their shops, near their 
schools and their churches. We slow-
ly progressed down the streets where 
crowds of children and families gath-
ered in festivity. When my friend  and 
I approached the hill I told him we 
could walk from there. We wouldn’t 
have made it far. There must have been 
at least 3,000 kids coming down the 
hill from church, all dressed colorfully 
and carrying small plastic bags full of 
candy and toys. They waved and smiled 
and shouted hello. I was sure we had 
missed the service, but the juxtaposi-
tion of elderly tourists marching down 

the towering Mount Sinai and the mob 
of children clamoring down Makattam 
was almost worth it.

I had planned on staying after the 
crowds in Sinai had gone. A fair amount 
of backpackers do this, some of the 
pious do as well. One man, likely in his 
70s, smashed his cane against a rock 
just over a small iron fence in what 
appeared to be an attempt at shatter-
ing off a portion to take home, a small 
prize for his pilgrimage. The rock didn’t 
give. The crowd, now dispersed and 
trekking back down the mountain, left 
behind piles of blankets and soda cans 
which the Bedouins, a local group that 
generally lives off tourism, casually col-

night or for an hour runs anywhere 
between five Egyptian pounds and five 
British pounds. Even in the small town 
of St. Catherine, where the area’s work-

inflated and almost everyone depends 
on tourism, working as a tour guides 
and bus drivers. Moreover, nearly 
everyone I encountered spoke not only 
impeccable English, but often German,

 After finding the cave churches of 
the monastery empty, we headed back 
into town and settled at a small coffee 
shop on Garbage City’s main street. 
We had been introduced to dozens of

and why I came here from the states. 

Descending Moses’ mountain, 
I headed down a path one of the 
Bedouins had pointed out which led 
across a small valley, through a garden 
where hikers and their guides camp 
overnight, and up the highest peak in 
Egypt to a small church. With very little 
water and a small box of dried dates, I 
set out to conquer the three-and-a-half 
hour climb. It was 6:30 a.m. when I left 
the peak of Mount Sinai, filled with 
over-priced candy bars, the remains of 
rushed tourists and plastic cups once 
filled with tea sold at five times the nor-
mal cost. I looked forward to reaching 

St. Catherine’s peak, and finding a simi-
lar setup, where I could maybe get some 
lunch and enjoy a view of the mountain 
made famous by the story of Moses 
from a vantage point far fewer see. 

Eventually, I left St. Catherine, 
exhausted and eager for Cairo. I had 
made it to the church on the highest 
peak, finding it closed and desolate. 
Without tourists, it rots away in the 
harsh desert sun. But I gathered some 
satisfaction that I had an experience of 
the mountain many don’t get. Leaving 
Garbage City less than a week later, I 
had the same satisfaction. This time I 
ran into some people who I remem-
bered meeting before and who remem-
bered meeting me. The thousands of 
kids parading down the mountain was 
a sight in itself and the hundreds playing 
in the streets on holiday, in the district 
of the garbage collectors of Cairo was 
a side of the city so few see. Without a 
full year to explore Egypt, I would never 
have visited; I would have probably gone 
to Mount Sinai to just snap a couple of 
photos. The big attractions are always 
a must-see when traveling, but it’s the 
obscure, the new and the truly local that 
come with living somewhere.

One day, Mokattam will be promi-
nent in guide books and a spot for 
tourists to pore over, but now it is quiet 
and the people, already isolated from 
greater Cairo on religious lines, seem 
to be much less tainted than many 
of the downtown residents who view 
tourists as either plague or opportu-
nity. St. Catherine’s has grown up on 
tourism, but outside of the guided 
path and the sunrise run which hun-
dreds see each morning, there is a 
vibrant and non-exploitative commu-
nity surrounded by a sparsely visited 
landscape of rocky peaks and garden 
filled valleys.

be an advocate for my people.”
The ability to protest, even in the face 

of severe consequences, as was often the 
case in Chile, is something Ubilla still 
cherishes today. Because of this, she 
finds the current sentiment toward pro-
test in the United States unsettling.

“Today, sometimes I feel that there 
are almost as many restrictions [on pro-
testing] as [those] I saw in Chile during 
the dictatorship, unfortunately,” Ubilla 
said. “There is fear among the young 
people. They understand the need to 
become involved, but they are afraid … 
of speaking.”

Ubilla’s completion of college hault-
ed her involvement in activist objec-
tives. After college, Ubilla split her time 
between teaching English and French 
at a local boys’ high school and volun-
teering for an unnamed Chilean com-
munications station as an anchorwom-
an. Ubilla interviewed countless local 
politicians as well as ordinary citizens 
for a humanitarian piece entitled “The 
People Speak.” For this segment, Ubilla 
traveled to severely dilapidated Chilean 
shantytowns to conduct interviews.

“Mainly my concern was to give 
the average individual, those who had 
never before had access to the media 
and whose voices were never articulated 
on the air, a voice,” Ubilla said.

Among her most prominent 
encounters as a reporter, however, 
was her brief interview with Chilean 
President Salvador Allende, a social-
ist politician concerned with issues of 
health care, after one of his national 
speeches. To Ubilla, Allende was a “very 
approachable man” as well as a “mag-
nificent figure and diplomat.” 

The interview took place a mere eight 
days before the military coup supported 
by President Richard Nixon overthrew 
the Allende administration on Sept. 
11, 1973. All tapes documenting this 
and other interviews were destroyed 
by militants of the coup. What Ubilla 
witnessed from this day forward was a 
wave of crime and destruction against 

Chile’s natural resources and its people, 
fueled by the “economic interests” of 
“transnational corporations.”

“It was a time of book burning and 
destruction of any kind of knowledge,” 
Ubilla said. “Any kind of creativity was 
annulled. It was a savage and barbaric 
structure that took power.”

Because Ubilla covered one of 
Allende’s last national addresses, her 
name appeared on a list of most-wanted 
revolutionaries by the new Chilean gov-
ernment, now run by military officer 
Augusto Pinochet. She went under-
ground for days and did not resurface 
until she learned that if she did not 
report to the local garrison within 24 
hours, she would be shot wherever offi-
cers found her. 

After two weeks of intense interro-
gation before a military tribunal, Ubilla 
was led to believe that she would receive 
the death penalty. While waiting to be 
called into one more day of interroga-
tion, Ubilla caught the gruesome sight 
of a bloodied body being dragged out 
of the room by soldiers. As the body 
came closer, she recognized the face as 
that of a colleague from the school she 
worked for.

“I knew I was next when I saw that,” 
Ubilla said. “All of the charges [against 
me] were complete and total inventions, 
though. I knew at all times they were 
only going against my ideas of support-
ing the poor and the government who 
were doing something for those who 
had never had anything.”

During the interrogation — perhaps 
as a trick, she suspected — Ubilla was 
taken to the school where she was for-
merly employed, where she witnessed 
the interrogation of her students. As 
a testament to her devotion to her 
students, Ubilla flung herself in front 
of them to shield them from physical 
harm. Today, she bears a scar across her 
back and shoulder after being hit with 
the butt of a rifle.

Ubilla was released, to her own 
bewilderment, under the condition that 
she could find someone to post bail 

within 24 hours. She was then placed 
under house arrest and mandated to 
report to the garrison daily at 6 p.m. for 
seven months. Her health deteriorated 
during this period and by the end of 
her imprisonment she weighed only 
105 pounds.

After corresponding with contacts 
she had in the United States, Ubilla 
left Chile on June 15 at 8:30 p.m. and 
landed in Los Angeles on June 16, 1974 
at 7 a.m. She has not been back to 
Chile since. Because of her support of 
Allende’s leftist policies, Ubilla’s family 
has since severed ties with her. She said 
she has not returned because there may 
still be some people harboring ill will 
toward her because of her past affili-
ations.  

Ubilla channels these experiences 
into her passion for teaching, providing 
her students with a historical context to 
which they can tether their studies.

Despite the devastation and trau-
ma she endured, Ubilla is seldom seen 
around campus without a smile. 

“I am an incurable optimist,” Ubilla 
said. “There is no remedy. I know that I 
will not see the changes that I would like 
to see in my lifetime, but I am not think-
ing of myself. I am thinking of genera-
tions of young people. I am an absolute 
believer in the dignity and nobility of 
the human being.”

Ubilla’s activism continues now 
in San Diego, after pursuing gradu-
ate studies at both the University of 
Texas and UCSD. She supports a num-
ber of local activist efforts including 
the Committee for World Democracy 
(CWD) at UCSD, the Association of 
Raza Educators in San Diego and mili-
tary counter-recruiting efforts through-
out San Diego.

Ubilla passionately clings to a hope-
ful idea.

“The future of the world is with the 
young people and I will never abandon 
them,” she said.

energy; however, it utilizes landfill 
gas in addition to natural gas. 

Whereas the UCSD plant gener-
ates 85 percent of campus electricity 
from the combustion of natural gas, 
8 percent of UCLA’s system runs 
on landfill gas, producing about 
3.5 megawatts of renewable power 
onsite.

UC Santa Cruz adopted a differ-
ent approach by buying renewable 
energy credits equal to 100 percent of 
the campus’ electricity consumption. 
These RECs are the tradable envi-
ronmental units of energy which, 
when purchased, subsidize the pro-
duction of renewable energy from 
companies further away, ultimately 
adding more renewable energy to the 
electric grid.

Funding for this initiative origi-
nated from a student fee of $3 per 
quarter, established by a student 
referendum in 2006, and the pro-
gram won an award through the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency’s 
Green Power Partnership. 

UCSD is already a leader in energy 
management, according to Coghlan, 
and is well known for energy effi-
cient building, smart methods for 
regulating energy consumption and 
for throttling down power produc-
tion when demand goes down.

One example of effective man-
agement was during the October 
wildfires when UCSD halted its own 
energy consumption to boost gener-
ation, adding 3 megawatts of electric-
ity to the San Diego Gas and Electric 
grid to help keep city lights on.

“During the height of the fire-
storm, when there was a crisis in the 
region, San Diego Gas and Electric 
called UCSD for help,” Coghlan said.

These efforts during the firestorm, 
along with UCSD’s efficient transpor-
tation system and the Green  Campus 
Intern Program won the university 
top honors in the fourth annual San 
Diego Excellence in Energy Awards, 
announced March 5.

For transportation, UCSD upped 
its biodiesel use this year to 20 per-
cent for all campus shuttles, and 100 
percent for the “Greenline” running 
from UCSD to the Hillcrest Medical 
Center. Additionally, UCSD utilizes 
electric and hybrid vehicles and is a 
leader in alternative transportation 
use. Forty-six percent of all com-
muters to UCSD used some form of 
alternative transportation in 2007.

Despite all of UCSD’s green 
efforts, the campus has one of the 
larger environmental footprints in 
the UC system, according to Dilliott.

The campus emitted roughly 
202,000 tons of carbon dioxide in 

2006, creating a greater environmen-
tal impact than all city-owned build-
ings in San Diego combined. 

However, UCSD’s emissions are 
comparable to other large research 
institutions, such as UC Davis, UC 
Berkeley and UCLA, which all rank 
higher, Dilliot said. Such research-
oriented universities have a higher 
energy output due to energy-intense 
laboratories and health care facilities. 
The obstacle is in striking a bal-
ance between expansion and reduced 
emissions, he said.

“We have a growing campus, and 
it’s going to be a challenge to offset 
the energy needs of that growth,” 
Dilliott said. “However, it’s important 
growth. [UCSD researchers] are the 
ones who are going to figure out how 
to solve the problems inside these 
labs.”

The Environment and 
Sustainability Initiative, which 
directs the university’s intellectual 
resources to the challenges of sustain-
ability, is one way UCSD is working 
toward addressing these issues. The 
initiative promotes inerdisciplinary 
research and collaboration across the 
UC system and with outside sources 
to apply the minds to the problem 
of climate change, ESI Sustainability 
Analyst Kristin Blackler said.

ESI Executive Director Lisa 
Shaffer stressed the cross-disciplin-
ary approach to a class of BILD 18 
students taking “Human Impact on 
the Environment” on April 9.

“We’re trying to change human 
behavior,” Shaffer said, “and that’s 
not just a science question; it’s a 
human question.”

However, bridging the divide 
between operations and academics 
is a strength of UCSD within the UC 
system, according to Coghlan.

“UCSD is a campus where fac-
ulty, students and researchers test 
ideas and experiment on campus,” 
Coghlan said. “UCSD is teaching 
the next generation of leaders how 
to address climate change. But not 
only are they teaching, they are also 
practicing what they teach, and that’s 
fantastic.”

While there are no easy answers 
to the challenges of global warm-
ing amid constant college expansion, 
Coghlan said, it sends an important 
message when campuses take steps 
toward reducing their own carbon 
footprints.

“It’s leading by example,” he said. 
“In taking concrete steps to become a 
greener university, UCSD is strength-
ening its educational mission.”

that improvement was like going from

Hornets vs. Spurs
Years ago, I made Wake Forest a 

Final Four team on the basis of one 
player who I felt could completely alter 
and dominate a game and tournament. 
That player was Chris Paul — and they 
lost in the Sweet 16. Nonetheless, I 
thought Paul was truly special. (I also 
thought Dallas McPherson was going 
to be special and felt Alex Smith could 
get the 49ers back to the playoffs, but 
at least I got one right.) Paul has been 
a game-changer since being selected 
fourth-overall in the 2005 draft. As the 
Bucks and Hawks repeatedly punch 
themselves in the balls for thinking 
Andrew Bogut and Marvin Williams 
would be better pros, Paul has taken 
a team from lottery to one of the top 
teams in one of the best conferences 
ever in just one season. With David 
West, the New Orleans Hornets have a 
reliable front-court presence, and with 
Peja Stojakovic they have the necessary 
annoying foreign guy who hits threes.

The defending-champion Spurs 
have their own Wake Forest product in 
Tim Duncan and have the market cor-
nered on annoying foreign players (you 
count too, Duncan, ya Virgin Islands 
bastard). The Spurs did two things dur-
ing their series with the Suns: 1) win an 
amazing game one that no other first-
round game had a chance of matching, 
and 2) show everyone that Shaq is an 
albatross on both ends of the court, 
especially when he can’t move toward a 
wide-open Duncan. Most importantly, 
San Antonio showed that it stills has its 
championship pedigree. The Hornets 
have become one of the most entertain-
ing teams and represent a city people 
should root for, as opposed to San 
Antonio, a city people should ignore 
completely. Hope for a long, dramatic 
series, but until the champ is dead, the 
champ will still be here.

JOE GOES WITH: Spurs in seven.

Lakers vs. Jazz
I hate the Utah Jazz. I hate their 

coach. I hate their city. I hate Malone 
and Stockton. I hate that they kept the 
name “Jazz” when moving to Utah to 
produce the most oxymoronic team 
name of all-time. I like the Lakers 
more than I hate the Jazz, but it’s 
close. Biases aside, the Jazz is none-
theless a team that, entering the play-
offs, should have been counted as a 
title contender. They’re not flashy, not 
dominant and have struggled against 
the Lakers this season. The strong 
point guard/power forward combina-
tion of Deron Williams and Carlos 
Boozer is the centerpiece of a team 
that also includes a potential great 
defensive player in Andrei Kirilenko. 
The trade for Kyle Korver also gave the 
team a three-point marksman to make 
Jeff Hornacek proud and a guy who 
can make those crucial free throws at 
the end of a close game.

Furthermore, the Jazz defense is 
top-notch — except when they’re play-
ing Kobe Bryant with something to 
prove. Kobe is part of a team that is a 
legitimate threat to every other squad. 
The trade for Pau Gasol is a huge part 
of that, as are the return of Derek 
Fisher and improved play of basi-
cally every member of that roster. If 
Andrew Bynum returned they would 
look scarier, but keeping him out 
allows them future safety and current 
chemistry. The Lakers will undergo 
a stretch of overconfidence and need 
to step up their defense on the road 
as the Jazz are extremely comfortable 
and effective in their high-altitude, 
white-bread arena. But Phil Jackson 
has two rings that show he knows how 
to win in Utah. It goes a little longer 
just because the Jazz want to fuck with 
my life.

JOE GOES WITH: Lakers in six.

adding that the team has been 
anticipating the showdown for a 
long time.

“We’ve been preparing since the 
beginning of the year in September,” 
she said. “It’s a crazy sport since we 
train for so hard for so long. It’s 
crazy because we don’t have that 
many regattas and it’s been a long 
build up them.” 

In 2006, head coach Pattie 
Pinkerton led the Tritons to their 
most successful year in school his-
tory, finishing in second place at 
the NCAA Division II National 
Championship. 

P i n k e r t o n 
said that she 
hopes to build 
on last year’s suc-
cess and they had 
their sights set on 
nationals.

“At the end, 
we have to be 
second in our 
region,” she 
said. “Western 
Washington is 
open water; if we 
can’t beat them 
we have to fin-
ish as close as we 

possibly can. While our goal is to 
win today it is also to be as fast as 
we can to show the national selec-
tors that we deserve that bid.”

Pinkerton said that the key to 
the Tritons’ success against the 
larger squads would be to row 
intelligently.

“The girls will really focus on 
using their legs to power the boat 
for the most speed we can get,” she 
said. “We’re not as big as the other 
crews so we have to row fast and 
smart.”

dence booster,” she said. “The 
first heat from yesterday was a lot 
tighter and today, we are doing 
the Grand Finals and it should be 
better battle for us.”

The second varsity eight 
also participated in the WIRA 
Championship Regatta finishing 
in sixth place of their heat. The 
novice eight, who finished in 10th 
out of the 33 schools competing, 
collected times of 7:41.4 and 7:49.5 
in their two races. For the women, 
the second day’s final consisted of 
the second novice eight, the varsity 
lightweight four, 
the second varsi-
ty eight and the 
varsity eight. 

The Triton 
varsity eight 
will again con-
tend with a 
six-team field 
that includes 
W i l l a m e t t e 
U n i v e r s i t y , 
Seattle Pacific 
U n i v e r s i t y , 
University of 
Colorado, Lewis 
and Clark and 
Humboldt State University.

According to Webb, the 
Tritons’ confidence and prepared-
ness against Seattle Pacific and 
Humboldt State stems not only 
from the first day of the regatta but 
also from seasoned experience as a 
result of last year.  

“We got up early and practiced 
this morning and basically we are 
really excited to race today,” Webb 
said. “These are two schools that 
are close to us competitively and 
we’re ready to fight, to show that 
we’re in it to win, and to show 
everybody what we’re all about.”

Myers shared Webb’s sentiment, 

a lot to win9 four years in a row,” 
Skorupa said. “Up until the 400 hur-
dles [the standings were] really close  
but we finally blew them away.”

The men’s team was able to ful-
fill their head coach’s expectation of 
a top-three finish. Junior sprinter 
Daniel Anderson’s second-place fin-
ish in the 800 meters paced the men, 
who improved upon last season’s fifth-
place finish. Junior jumper Scott Tsuda 
took home the men’s only event vic-
tory when he won the triple jump with 
his mark of 45 feet, 5.75 inches. The 
Tritons’ representative at nationals, 
sophomore jumper Casey Ryan, took 
second place in the high jump with his 
leap of 6 feet, 10.25 inches.

notch athletes to cruise to another title.

“We went to a lot of competitive 
meets and our marks were improv-
ing at each meet,” junior jumper Leah 
Murphy said. “And now we have a 
real chance to place in the top four at 
nationals, which is something UCSD 
has never done before.”

Skorupa said UCSD’s yearlong 
ascension was interesting.

“We go to meets throughout the 
year and the athletes there that we are 
competing with are ridiculously good,” 
Skorupa said. “By the time conference 
comes around we’re the top athletes 
at the meet instead of the other way 
around. It really helps prepare us.”

The Tritons can now start focus-

ing on turning in the school’s best 
ever finish at the NCAA National 
Championships.

“It really raises the level of compe-
tition to have the whole team behind 
you,” Ahner said. “When there is a 
team there you get more out of per-
formances because they’re not just 
competing for themselves, but they’re 
doing it for the team.”

Besides a few seniors who will get 
one last chance to qualify for nationals

HOT CORNER

For the first time since the 1998-99 lockout-shortened year, the NBA has seen actual parity. 
Most years, there are three or four 
teams that educated observers (not 
you, drunk guy who randomly yells 
“foul” every 15 seconds) feel could 
legitimately win the title. Now, seven 
teams could realistically be title con-
tenders, while three others look like 
they’re not far from reaching that 
level. Despite the spread of success 
that left a scary 48-win team like 

Golden State on the outside looking 
in, the first round of the playoffs saw 
no upsets, except for Detroit and 
Boston losing some games to sub-
.500 teams. With the top four seeds 
advancing in each conference, there 
might not be amazing upset poten-
tial, but we still have some amazing 
matchups that will continue to make 
people relove this game and forget 
about that Donaghy guy.

Celtics vs. Cavaliers
The Cavaliers’ reward for getting 

through the regular season, a strategy 
known as “Shaq-ing it,” is facing the 
best team in the league in the second 
round. This might look bad when you 
consider how many games the Celtics 
dominated and won, but if the Atlanta 
Hawks are able to push the Celtics 
and their Boston Three-Party (or, as 
I like to call them, the Can’t-Win-On-
Their-Own All-Stars) to seven games, 
shouldn’t King James and the name-
less four guys you throw out there be 
able to do just as much, if not more? 
Sure, a team with guys named Boobie 
and Wally Szczerbiak should at least 
be entertaining, and it’s really hard 
to pick against someone who has as 
much game as LeBron. But remember, 
Ray Allen was in “He Got Game” and 
it’s just as hard to pick against Jesus 
Shuttlesworth. Look for a battle, but 
even with Doc Rivers on the bench 
the Celtics can’t be so naive as to take 
another team lightly.

JOE GOES WITH: Celtics in six.

Pistons vs. Magic
This Pistons team is better than 

the squad that won a title against the 
Lakers, lost in seven to the Spurs and 
upset one of the greatest playoff perfor-
mances ever last year by the LeBrons. 
They still have the core of Rasheed 
Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, Chauncey 
Billups and Rip Hamilton, but more 
importantly have developed a strong 
bench with guys like Jason Maxiell, 
Arron Affalo and Rodney Stuckey. It 
looks like Theo Ratliff is getting actual 
playing time, which would be the first 
time since he was my starting center in 
NBA Live ’07 (he was overpaid on that 
team, too).

Orlando is an up-and-coming team 
with a great coach in Stan Van Gundy 
and an even better building block in 
Dwight Howard. Detroit has a ten-
dency to take teams a little lightly, and 
Howard has a chance to be a once-
in-a-generation player if he can avoid 
injuries and find a better point guard. 
Unfortunately for D-Ho, the Magic’s 
second-best player is Hedo Turkoglu, 
and while he might be most improved, 

Triton women’s varsity eight team 
charged triumphantly into first 
place of their own heat with a time 
of 7:03.7. 

Securing their victory by an 
ample 10 seconds, the Tritons left 
a trail of boats in their wake start-
ing with second place Colorado at 
7:13.8, Lewis and Clark at 7:14.6, 
UC Santa Barbara at 7:18.6, Pacific 
Lutheran University at 7:26.0 
and Arizona State University at 
7:31.0.

Senior co-captain Kali Webb 
said that her squad won the race by 
being determined and relentless. 

“We wanted to keep pushing 
the envelope and pushing the 
boundaries to see how far we 
could go,” she said.

Fellow senior and co-captain 
Jen Myers said that the team’s vic-
tory hinged on its teamwork.

“We had a really good focus 
and the team was working as 
one so that was a great confi-

The men’s track and field team, which placed fifth at last season’s conference championships, pulled ahead in the final round this year to earn a top-three finish.

Women’s track and field 
wins fourth straight 
conference champs 
while men grab a third-
place finish.

Tritons Dominate League Finals

By Jake Blanc
Associate Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — Already sport-
ing an outstanding team performance 
littered with record-setting individual 
marks, UCSD cemented its standing 
as the best Division-II program in 
the nation at the California Collegiate 
Athletics Association Championships 
last week. The Triton women took their 
fourth straight conference title while 
the men grabbed a third-place fin-
ish, two expectations that the coaching 
staff held for its athletes. The women 
claimed first place with a total of 248 
points to easily beat out second-place 
Chico State’s 199. On the men’s side, 
UCSD battled all weekend, turning in a 
handful of clutch performances on the 
final day of the meet that pushed their 
point total to 134, just enough to guar-
antee them a top-three finish.

“I am very excited for the seniors 
— it was such a special thing for them 
to go four in a row at the conference 
championships,” women’s head coach 
Darcy Ahner said. “It was really special 
and the number of conference cham-
pions was amazing; we matched our 
all-time number of nine champions.”

Although UCSD competed against 
tougher teams in previous nonconfer-
ence meets, the conference champion-
ships offered a new sense of excitement 
and energy that permeated the entire-
weekend meet.

“The atmosphere was awesome; 

there is nothing like competing at con-
ference,” junior hurdler Katie Skorupa 
said. “Even people who weren’t com-
peting drove up to support us.”

Aside from finishing the regular 
season as the conference’s best team, 
the Triton women took some top indi-
vidual awards, too. In her first year as 
the women’s head coach, Ahner was 
named the CCAA Women’s Coach of 
the Year for guiding the team to its 
perch atop the national rankings. Senior 
jumper Whitney Johnson turned in the 
best weekend of her career and was 
named the CCAA Female Athlete of 

the Year. Rounding out the women’s 
awards sweep was freshman sprint-
er Kelly Fogarty, who earned CCAA 
Freshman of the Year honors.

Johnson, who was participating in 
her final CCAA Championship, eas-
ily won the women’s long jump with 
her monstrous leap of 19 feet, 10.25 
inches, a mark that shattered her own 
previously held all-time UCSD record. 
Not content with her victory in the 
long jump, Johnson repeated last year’s 
CCAA domination by again sweeping 
the jumping competitions and win-
ning the triple jump with a mark of 42 

feet, 4.25 inches. 
UCSD went into the final day 

of the meet clinging to a very small 
lead over second-place Chico State, 
but the women’s 400-meter hurdles 
provided the opportunity for the 
Tritons to distance themselves from 
their competition. In the event, sopho-
more Christine Merrill took first place 
immediately followed by teammates 
Skorupa, senior Corey Sheredy and 
junior Jennifer Albertson. 

“Chico is a huge rival and it meant

CREW — The UCSD Triton 
men’s and women’s rowing teams 
performed explosively dur-
ing the first day of the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships held at Rancho 
Cordova on May 3, qualifying 
eight total boats for the final heats 
the following day.

The sophomore tandem of Ryan 
Armando and Dan Hallisy won the 
Pair Petite Final, racing into first 
place with a time of 8:06.4. Their 
finish topped University of Puget 
Sound (8:08.3), Orange Coast 
College (8:09.7) and University of 
the Pacific (8:10.9). 

“It felt good to finish the day 
off with the win,” Armando said. 
“At the same time, though, we were 
disappointed not to qualify for the 
grand finals but yes, the win was 
definitely nice.”

Armando credited his cohesion 
with Hallisy for the win.

“We row really well together,” 
he said. “Last year we were all in 
the same boats and this year we 
ended up rowing in all the same 
boats. We have really similar row-
ing styles and similar power so we 
match up really well. Basically it 
just works out really well.” 

The men’s varsity eight boat 
battled in a neck-and-neck pur-
suit for first, ultimately arriving 
in second and making it past the 

Eight Boats Advance to Western Finals

finish line with a time of 6:06.7, 
triumphing significantly ahead 
of Washington State University 
(6:12.9), University of Colorado 
(6:20.2), Western Washington 
University (6:21.7) and Lewis and 
Clark University (6:26.4). Leading 
in first with only a tiny edge over 
the Tritons was the University of 
San Diego, with a time of 6:05.5.

The men’s varsity eight final, 
which was to be held on May 
4 during day two of the WIRA 
Championships, put UCSD against 
OCC, Gonzaga University, USD, 
Santa Clara University, and UC 
Davis. Results were not finalized as 
of press time.

According to head coach Zach 
Johnson, the Tritons will have 
to step up their intensity if they 
expect to place high on day two.

“We’re just going to try and 
change our strategy a little bit, 
race harder in the 1,000 meters,” 
Johnson said. “This race — because 
everyone is so close, it’s going to be 
a dog fight.”

Notably, the novice eight also 
won second place in their heat, 
entering behind OCC with a time 
of 6:15.3, a time that also qualified 
them for Sunday’s final.

Overall, the men’s rowing team 
will have a total of four boats com-
peting in the Grand Finals of the 
second day: the second novice 
eight, the novice eight, the second 
varsity eight and the varsity eight.

Senior varsity eight member 
Gilbert Collins said team members 
would need just as much mental as 
physical preparation for the 1,000-
meter race. 

“We’re just going to go out there 
and lay it down as hard as we pos-
sibly can in the first half of the 
race,” he said. “With crew, half of 
it is physical, about endurance and 
strength, and the other half is psy-
chological. We’re going to lay down 
what we’ve got.” 

The women’s team paralleled 
the men’s solid heat performanc-
es, also qualifying four of their 
boats to compete in finals. The 

Strong opening
performances leave 
UCSD in good position 
to capture the title in 
Grand Final.

SERVICES
A criminal record may interfere 
with obtaining employment 
and even a license to work in 
your chosen profession. My law 

practice prepares students with 
a criminal history to obtain a 
professional license and enter 
the job force with their best 
foot forward. We help students 

demonstrate their rehabilita-
tion by offering many services 
at very affordable rates. Free 
consultation to any student
