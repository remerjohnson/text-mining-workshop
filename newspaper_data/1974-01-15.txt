Women on CaDlpus: Is Affirmative Action Working? 
One of the central issues connected 

with the UCSD campus is the existence 
and elimination of discrimination again t 
women . Whether or not any extant 
discrimination is eliminated depends on 
the effectiveness of the Affirmative 
Action Program on campus. In speaking 
to individuals most closely connected 

ith the program, different, and often, 
ametrically opposea, eVdlUdllU',) UI 

the university's efforts emerged. 
Ultimate authority in the Affirmative 

Action program rests with Chancellor 
McElroy. According to McElroy, the 
problem of discrimination against 
women at UCSD is being attacked ef-
fectively on a number of levels. McElroy 
appointed an Affirmative Action Ad-
visory Committee (with a subcommittee 
on women and minority affairs) which 
"evaluates both our policy document 
and projected annual goals." In addition, 
"we made it known that departments and 
earch committees had to make a 

genuine- effort on behalf of affirmative 
action and be able to prove it." 

In connection with faculty ap-
pointments McElroy cited a progression 
in the la t three years. He stated that in 
1971 there were six women on the 
fa 'ulty; by November of 1973 there w re 
31. 

The area which requires most at-
tention, he stated, i faculty tenure 
appointments. This is bein g attacked by 
means of effort to recruit women into 
graduate programs. To thi end a full -
time coordinator has been set up in the 
offi ce of the Dean of Graduate Studies . 

On the staff side, McElroy tated , 
"Although overall gains in the em-
ployment of women may appear nominal 
in terms of percentages, there is a 
significant trend toward representation 
in upper level positions, which have not-
previously been represented. It is noted 
that approximately 10 percent of our 
Management Program positions are 
currently occupied by women." 

A different estimate of the Affirmative 
A tion efforts on campus w~s voiced by 

by Greg Hicks 
jane Frazer, a member of the Affirmative 
Action Advisory ommittee, she tated . 
" Progress has been made in some areas, 
notably in non-tenure faculty hiring, but 
little or nothing has been accomplished 
toward the solution of other problems." 
She voiced a number of specific com-
plaints, stating that women are grouped 
in lower paying job categories, often 
doing work above their level of em-
ployment, but not receiving the. ap-
propriate title or wages. In addition, Ms. 
Frazer stated, women are placed in the 
lowest echelons of each job category 
(there are three to five levels within each 
category, e.g .. , the 'Specialist' category 
has four distinct levels) . She added that 
such grouping occurs in a great number 
of diverse categories. The explanation is 
that "men come into the jobs originally 
at higher levels and may be promoted 
faster, and that job and salary 
classifications are generally set to reflect 
sex stereotyping; that is, the hiring 
supervisor sees men as family bread-
winners who " need" more pay than 
women , and so reque.s t higher 
classifications for jobs they envi ion a 
filled by men." 

Ms. Fra zer asserted further that even 
with th ame job title, women rec iv 
lower pay than men. For xample, 
"About 10 percent of th positions in the 
Management Program are h Id by 
women, and the mo t highly paid woman 
in thi s ategory is paid Ie s than the 
average o f the men '~ sa lari 

The wor t problem, Ms. !-razer tatco, 
is at the manag ment level. One of th 
reasons he citet.: for the mall number of 
women at the management level i the 
practice of an entourage being brought 
along with a high-level official High 
level administrator can then bypass 
Affirmative Action and bring in people of 
their own choosing. 

Another problem area cited by M . 
Frazer has to do with the listing of job 
and the required 'holding period' for 
those job Sh(' tated that oftE'n the 

li~tin~ of iob~ With th(' Pt'r~nnel offi e 

and holding those jobs open so t hat 
women and minority recruitment ca n be 
implemented are not done. 

a much higher position 
Ms Poltese asserted al 0 that ap-

plicant files are often not canned 
sufficiently and that holding period 
requirements are violated ( he Cited two 
in tances of jobs being refu ed after 

Ms. Frazer also alleged exploitation of 
women faculty members . Often, she 
aid, women are kept off the regular 

faculty by excuses such as lack of money 
or absence of department chairmen. In 
her view~ "equal opportunity con-
siderations" must begi n to play a

the e jobs). Also, she stated, job are 
modified, i.e. redefined, after women 
have applied, so that the e wom n' 
qualifications are no longer adequate ignificant role in the allocation of 

faculty positions. Ruth Covell, a member of the Af-
firmative Action Advisory Committee 
stated that though "Advances have b n 
made, particularly in the area of facult ," 
there are a number of problem he aid 
that job cia sification mu t b reViewed 
and that there are not ufficient "op-
portunitie on the job for profe sional 

A similar attitude was expressed by 
Lilian Poltese, as a spokesperson for the 
Affirmative Action Committee of 
California NOW. She stated that often 
women end up i n lower job 
c lassifications because they will be 
offered a secretarial position even 
though their credentials qualify them for Continued on Page 7

Cynicism and Reason 

Last week, in his State of the State Address, Governor 
Reagan proclaimed : " There is a feeling among our 
people of distrust and cynicism toward public affairs 
and public officials, It matters little that some of the 
events which contribute to this cynicism are not of our 
making," 

However, when later detailing his ideas for the further 
progress of the State , of California in 1974, Reagan 
announced plans for an " Academy for Educational 
Management", to "help train and assist administrators 
in managing public schools efficiently and 
economically," 

At first glance, this proposal may seem rather am-
biguous to the inexperienced eye. but a further look at 
the Gbvernor's statements o n the sa me subject do 
indeed seem to contradict his thesis that " ",some of t he 
events wh ich contribute to this cynicism are not of our 
making," 

The Governor explains: " I do not believe California's 
parents accept. or will tolerate. the closing of sc hools 
because of strikes, Essential publ ic services must never 
be interrupted or compromi sed by labor disputes that 
can be resolved by reasonable people, acting with 
reason ,"

Commentary 

Third College Curriculum: 
A Realistic Program 

By Holly Hitzemann 

" Today, our society is in the 
process of a moral, social and 
tech nologi ca I evol ution . Youth 
feel s alienated from prevailing 
institutions and concepts , Ethnic 
minorities are separated from the 
mainstream of society by 
frightening social and economic 
barriers. The deterioration of our 
physical environment and the 
imput of an overwhelming 
technology are increasingly af-
fecting values and ways of our 
daily life.",These grave problems 
require the education of citizens 
who will be committed to their 
solutions, will learn to analyze 
them objectively and will acquire 
the technical competence to cope 
with them. This is the educational 
aim of Third College." 

fectiveness . A curriculum is 
designed to meet the needs of its 
students and transfer information 
and useful techniques and skills, 
not to mention interest, to them . 
Whether or not a curriculum can or 
does successfully accomplish these 
requ irements determines its 
quality. Therefore, I will not 
present Third College's Academ ic 
Plan on a comparative basis, but 
rather on a level which will reveal 
its distinct composition and 
ideology . 

So now we've reached a point 
where Third can be at least par-
tially understood, or in real fact 
discovered and seen realistically, 
not mythologically . Third 's 
curriculum is designed to give its 
students a flexibility in choosing 
what courses would best satisfy 
and acquaint them in their areas of 
interest. Undergraduate math for 
example is offered on four 
sequences; each sequence 
designed to meet the level a 
student is at when he or she enters 
the college, It should be noted that 
with certain majors , say in 
psychology or the social sciences, 
may not be interested in taking 
more than a basic sequence, and is 

not required to tackle more in-
volved courses such as in the two 
sequences, Overall the idea is to 
meet student's need and interests 
on an individual , not deper-
sonalized basis , 

Flexible yet structured : th is is 
how I see Third. Its breadth 
requirements are demanding; they 
are structured requirements, which 
must be met before graduation. 
Briefly, Third's requirements are 
such :' one course in composition, 
three courses in Third World 
Studies designed to also give 
students a background in the 
humanities and the social sciences; 
two courses of Math ; three courses 
in Scie'lce and Technology which 
encompass biology, chemistry and 
physics; two courses in com-
munications; and three courses in 
Urban and Rural Studies. Unique to 
Third is the field placement 
program it offers to its majors in 
Urban and Rural studies which 
allows juniors and seniors to intern 
in their individual area of em-
phasis. Some students for example 
are placed in the field working 
with The City Planning C.om-
m,ission , Model City, or various 
cont on p-7 

The preceeding is an excerpt 
from the Third College Academic 
Plan , published in October, 1969, I

"educational aim" in the last

portant to explore not only its

AA Program 
Shows Success 

The Division of Employee Development Programs 
(DEDP) was originally created in 1969 as an affirmative 
action arm of the University, designed to bring un-
skilled, unemployed adults from underprivileged areas 
into the UCSD system by training them to qualify for 
!1osi tions on campus and at Universi ty Hospital. The 
three main areas of DEDP training - Clerical. Health 
and Laboratory Sc ience - were purposely set up in fields 
for which there IS high demand. 

DEDP is a division of the campus Personnel Office; 
the DEDP administrative offices and classrooms are 
located in Rms, 220-236 of the Humanities library on 
Revelle campus . Although originally funded through 

. campL'S Urban Crisis monies, DEDP sought and received 
Model Citk s sponsorship in july, 1971, and has con-
tinued as an ongoing project under San Diego Model 
Cities since that time. 

How Does DEDP Function? - DEDP supervises the New 
Careers program (a 2-year work-study program) on 
campus and supervises individual training slots for 
trainees in Laboratory Science and other fields , DEDP 
has also administered Hed lth Entry Level training classes 
at University Hospital; this program is at present non-
operative due to federal funding cuts , However, DEDP's 
main function is a six-month Clerical Program which 
trains individuals to qualify for the positions of Clerk, 
Clerk/Typist, Sr, Clerk/Typist, Secretary 1 and Secretary 
lIShorthand. depending upon past education and 
experience, The Clerical Program maintains a constant 
class level of approximately 20 trainees ; as trainees

By Zvi Kam 
In these days when Egyptians and Israelis confer in 

Geneva to discuss peace, one would be tempted to 
presume that Egyptian authorities would encourage 
their people to view thei r neighbors with less emotion 
and more reason . However, readi ng Egyptian 
newspapers one gets the opposite impression 

In the November 28th 1973 issue of "Akher Sa'ah ," 
Egypt's most important and influential magazine, a 
dramatic play is published . Its title is "The Tragedy of 
the Good Father Tomma" and its author is Musttafa 
Sa'adani, an ex-<:liplomat in Egypt's foreign servi ce , 

The place: The Jewish ghetto of Damascus. Syria , 
The time : Wednesday night, February 4th 1840. 
The plot: What Jews would do for hold ing their cultic 

ceremonies. 
One scene of the play takes pl i.\ce at the house of 

David Harrari, a notable of the Jewish community of 
Damascus . Two Rabbis and a number of notables are 
present. 

They craftily tempt the Christian monk Tomma to 
come to the house , He has been told that one of the 
Jt!ws had called him over for curing his sick son, and 
Tomma has fallen into the trap, 

At a certain moment the conversation goes l ike this: 
Rabbi Abul 'a fie (to Tomma) : Don't you want to give any 
present to the synagogue? 

Tomma : I have nothing but my faith , 
Rabbi Abul'afie : Your benediction and prayers are 

worthless for us. 
Tomma: Hence I cannot donate anything. 
Rabbi Saloniki : Do not be so modest. One drop of 

your blood if properly bleeded will come to be the holy 
blood which is of a great use for us, 

Tomma (scared) : I do not understand anything . 
Rabbi Saloniki : You certainly do understand . The 

Jewish cultic ceremoni es have ceased , Jews are dying 
and being born without anybody spraying them with the 
holy blood . Passover is around the corner and we need 
blood in order to knead the matzot with. The Iraqi Jews 
are also asking us to get them some blood, since there 
too they ceased to hold ceremonies, 

Tomma (horrified): You must be joking. 
Abul 'afie : As this is connected to faith and religion. 

we can not be joking. 
Then Tomma tries to convince the jews to let him 

free . After iI coupl of futile attempts he tries to Win 
their sympathy by stating his bell f that th ChrIStian 
governments will help the Jews to settle in Palestll1e

Your limbs will be amputated one by one. 

The Jews rise and draw daggers. One of them brings a 
rope. Others tie Tomma's hands. and do the same With 
his Moslem servant Ibrahim . Afterwards they take off 
their clothes and remain stark naked Rabbi Salonlk I 
comes close to Tomma to make sure he IS un-

monk in his belly. The others do the same ac-
companying their actions by slnging and dancing.

Our original intention 
was to ~end this letter to 
TIME Magazine. but some 
of the recent letters in TIME 

~upportin g our Pres ident's 
act ions lead us to believe 
that through the TT we are 
reaching a much more 
intelligent const ituency. 

On our last (January 4) 
trip from Sa n Francisco to 
UCSD we were appalled at 
the number of violators of 
the recently imposed 55 
MPH speed limit , 

Recause of ample news 
media coverage. we feel 
certain that most all of the 
violators could not have 
been ignorant of the law 
.lnd mu t have been aware 
of th ir negligence. 

[specia lly irritating to u 
was the fact that all too 
many o f th e flagrant 
violator (65-75 MPH) were 
oriving large. gas-guzzling. 
over power d. " Executive 
Specials." often with on ly 
one person in the car. 

Of course. some sma ll 
rars were also violating the 

~p ed limit. but it i ~ dif-

Admittedly. we were also 
contributing to the gasoline 

~ hortage. but by im-
plementing gas conservi~g 
measures such as a tune-up. 

~ MPH speed. and "car 
pooling." we were able to 
minimiLe our effect upon it , 

It is our hope. then . that

Your Front-page artlCl of 

january 8. 1974. "Prop 1 
The way The Students 
Voted" was probably the 
most Irrespon Ible PIPCC of 
reportll1g that I've read In a 
student newspaper 

To Imply in your econd 
paragraph that it small 
turnout of student vot~rs 
had a " .. , po sibly deciSive 
role in deciding the fate of 
Proposition 1 . ". which 
was defeated by a margll1 of 
1.27 to 1 (340.000 votes) IS 

from my van to p ople' 
rooms and loading the 
vehicle for our exodus 
home. I noticed a man 
adjusting a sprinkler on 

~ome plants, I stopped 
nearby to rest and began 
admiring and really 
noticing the beauty of the 
~urrounding greenery . I 
asked the man . " Has 
anyone ever told you that 
you do one hell of a good 
job keeping this place 
looking nice?" I was sur-
prised to see a very sad-
dened expression on his 
face . He replied. "No, not po sibly the grossest form 
rea lly Thanks " . of conceit and rhap odIC 

I was hit with the apathy rol'ed into one 
realization that I was. as? paragraph that I've . Wlt-
U SO student. as guilty of ne.s ed .from ~he pmtlne

I, FrOl Level, N.C. 

I study Chinese . Not for a career, nor for 
pleasure, nor self-improvement. But once I walked 
into a bathroom in Frog Level, N .C. ... 

It's an isoltted little mountain town, Frog Level 
is, probably best known locally for a ballad 
composed by its favorite son (unfortunately 
anonymous, and almost universally unsung), 
whose lyrics have passed through generations of 
Frog Levelers. Wailed to a simple, plaintive tune, 
it goes: 

I keep my arms wide ope'n all the time 
1 keep my pants up with a piece of twine 
(I guess I'll take it as a sign) 
If you'll be mine, please pull the twine 

* â¢â¢ * *" 

II. The BathrooR) 
Simple though its tunes may be, Frog Level 

represenled complications the day I sat waiting 
for my car to be beaten, kicked and if need be 
sneered at until it shaped itself into something 
operable (I had encountered a mountain deer with 
several feet of my VW's hood) . I found myself, I 
say. in the bathroom of the CritsN'Cristle Dinett e, 
both puzzled and troubled by the strange in-
scription which had been lipsticked over both 
mirrors (the color was Deadly Nightshade, I 
believe, part of the Poisonous Pouts collection 
marketed that year . 'Belladonna' and 'Arsenic and 
Old Face' were also popular.) The writer had taken 
some care in conveying her message . First , a line 
of calligraphv had been drawn . The strokes were 
sharp and c lear and nicely thickE'ned in the right 
spots . Then , underneath, the characters had been 
romani;>:ed, lJsing the Pingyin system . This read : 

Shi da ge ren c hi tushuguan . 

Next the cryptic line had been rendered in a 
system quitp unknown to me, what looked to be a 
combinat'on of Caelic runes , cabalistic hexes and 
Japanese traffic signs. Finally a line of English had 
been prillted : Ten big men eat libraries. It 
sounded ominous. I washed m')4-teeth , brushed my 
face, and po,ldered Women 's bathroom's are 
general :y dull . (I had once played cards in a men's 
room in florida and found the atmosphere in-
finitely more refreshing) . I made my decision . I 
quickly copied all four lines on a handy two-ply, 
wadded it into my bottle of Excedrin and breathed 
a sigh of accomplishment . That phrase was 
saturated like a sponge with dark, ripe meaning, 
and I meant to determine it a:1. It could be 
significant. Ore never knows .

Rugby Team 

Split With NRC Danish Gym Team 
. Performs Tomorrow by John Staight 

A new asp"Ll of sports will be exhibited tomorrow 
night as the Danish Gymnastics Team will visit UCSD to 
show their world-famous performance . 

Only one performance will take place here, tomorrow 
at 8 p.m. in the Main Gym. Tickets are available in the 
recreation gym and at the door, with prices that all can 
afford . Ticket prices are 51 for students and 52 for the 
genera l public . 

Performances will include folk-dancing as well as the 
famed gymnastics, which are accompanied by 
background music . The rhythm, grace and startling 
physical gymnastics will inspire the viewer, as those 
who have seen this group before will testify. 

This appearance is part of a West Coast tour, from 
January 5 through February 17, that the team is making, 
and the tour will visit throughout California, Oregon, 
Washington and Arizona. 

It has been ten years since Ribe County, the home of 
the team, began to organize the groups. All of the 
gymnasts have been training in schools and local gyms 
since the age of seven or eight, and are se lected from 
Ribe County exclUSively. 

Three members of the present team have been to the 
U.S., and one to South America on previous tours . The 
whole team has given many brilliant performances in 
Denmark and other countries, and plan an excellent 
performance for this tour . 

For those who have viewed or participated in gym-
nastics, it has been and is a great satisfaction . For the 
Danes, it has a natural affinity, and thus an inspiration 
to all. -

It WlS a dark and stormy 
night, but as rugby luck 
woo kl have it, the day 
dawned with clear skies and 
a tI rly warm sun . The 
UCSD ru ggers traveled to 
Teawinkle Jr . High in 
Newport Beach last 
Satulday to take on the 
Newport Rugby Club . 

The Newport Weasels are 
a strong club with an ample 
su pply of experienced 
players . The first game 
certa illy was a humdinger 
with all kinds of exciting 
a nd neat stuff happeninR. 

The Weasels played 
rough brand of rugby , 
consta ntly attacki ng and 
takilgadvantage of UCSD's 
mistakes . The first half was 
a tough fight, very close all 
the way. 

Just before half-time, th 
Tritons were awarded a 
penaky kick. Bill (But-
terball) Gates set up around 
the 40 yard line and booted 
a beautiful spiral between 
the up-rights, to give the 
Tritons a 3-0 lead . 

The Weasels .fought back 
aggressively , so much so 
th at UCSD was awarded 
another kick. Sheepishly, 
Butterball chalked up 
anoth er three -pointer. 
Aga il, Gordon Acres and 
" Old-Man" Huber led the 
Triton backs with fine play 
a nd fa irly ungrim deter-
mination. 

Near the end of the 
game, Gordy assured 
vic to ry for UCSD by picking

the ball out of a tangled 
m ass of ruggers and 
sp rin tin g &5 yards for the 
try . Butterball kicked the 
conversion, making the 
final score UCSD 12, 
Weasels O. 

The second game 
continued the same style of 
aggressive play on the side 
of th e Newport club . 
Playing with many new 
ru III ers , the UCSD second 
team had a difficult go of it, 
try i1 g to establ ish a smooth 
balance of play . The backs 
were a b it ragged and the 
scrum was a little slow in 
pu rsu t. 

Fat Eric indeed was a 
bastion of fine play and 
rugby know-how. Eric lead 
th e sc I\J m and worked well 
around the ball . Peter 
' You 're-nuts- if-you-think-
I' m-going-to- tackle-him" 
Sertic found the range on a 
penalty kick and got three 
pain IS for the struggling 
UCSD seconds . The 
Weasels scored several 
times and the game ended 
with the Tritons losing. 

Next week is the home 
a pen er for the UCS D 
ru ggers and boy-o-boy is it a 
big gie . On Sa turday , 
begin ning at 10 a .m. UCSD 
is hosting four teams from 
UClA . A large crowd is 
expected. All are invited 
00 t to the rugby field for 
some good rugby and some 
excellent weather that has 
been arranged for through 
P.E. department. 

Last Saturday night was 
one of those typically

Well , not long ago the 

There seems to be a 
ra mpant case of apathy 
among the students at 
UCSD, even among those 
people who managed to 
find the gym . It is rather 
distressing to show up at a 
game where the visiting 
team somehow manages to 
have more rooters at the 
game than does the home 
team. Not only was that the '

graduate and are hired, new trainees enter the progr~m . 
DEDP clerical training consists of classroom instruction 
by qualified Adult Education teachers, combined with 
employment counseling .. supportive personal coun-
se ling and on-the-job work experience in various 
campus offices . DEDP is accredited to grant credits 
toward a high school diploma, and many individuals 
have earned their diplomas while in training at DEDP_ 

As DEDP trainees complete the program, they are 
sent through the campus Employment Office to in-
terview for regular clerical openings . The only dif-
ference between a DEDP graduate and any other 
potential employee is that the DEDP candidate may be 
hired immediately, Without the usual three-week 
waiting ~riod . 

DEDP aso provides services for UCSD employees and 
students - an employee who lacks a high school diploma 
may attend special classes at DEDP to earn it; em-
ployees or students who wish to improve their skills may 
attend special classes in Typing and Stenoscript. 

More than 90% of whose who complete DEDP 
training are hired, either at UCSD or in the community . 
Since the program's inception in 1969, 143 individuals 
have been placed in jobs on campus or at University 
Hospital. The retention rate for these employees 
continues steadily at over 70%. 

Even more important than the initial hiring of DEDP ' 
graduates is what happens to them afterwards - do they 
remain at entry level or do they progress? Perhaps a few 
examples can answer that question. One woman hired 
as a Clerk/Typist is now a Cou nselor II; another is an 
Administrative Asst. One man hired as a Watchman 
at University Hospital is now a Lab. Asst. III; one hired 
as a Messenger is a Lab . Ass\. II ; and yet another, hired 
as a Clerk, is presently a Photo Tec~nician . Another 
example is a young woman who began as a Lab. Asst. I 
at University Hospital ; she is now a licensed Pediatric 
Pulmonary Technician in a Northern California hospital . 

It appears that DEDP training does improve par-
ticipants' ski lls, helping them to become fully qualif~ed 
and also preparing them for upgrade. But most Im-
portantly, the DEDP program shows that supposedly 
"unemployable" adults can succeed and contribute 
greatly to the work force - if they are given the op-
portunity.

Affirmative Action

growth~ (e.g., challenging assignments). 

Also, she stated, many women are 
afraid to speak out against the University 
administration for fear of losing their 
jobs. 

According to Bernard Sisco, who is in 
charge of implementation of Affirmative 
Action policies on the staff side, there is 
a problem with women being shoved into 
lower job categories . He stated that there 
was an almost universal tendency 10 
years ago, that exists to a lesser extent 
today, to make stereotyped job offers to 
women . The view was that a woman 
could do with a secretarial job but a man 
needed 'the money, so he deserved a 
higher placement . This explains, Sisco 
said, why there is such a preponderance 
of women in secretarial positions at 
present. 

As far as the assertion that women 
receive less pay for doing the same job, 
Sisco said that of the cases which he has 
examined there has been no inequities as 
far as pay is concerned. Differences in 
pay are due to differences in personnel 
that justify such discrepancies. Chan-
cellor McElroy commented that where 
discrepancies appear, merit increases 
(which vary based on performance) must 
be taken into account. 

Jane Frazer stated that discrepancies in 
salary do exist, and should be looked in 
to. Perhaps, she said, these discrepancies 
do not reflect discrimination , but " no 
explanation has been given as yet." Jack 
Douglas, Affirmative Action monitor, 
claims that such research is being carried 
on but there are not suffic ient resources 
fo; it to progress very rapidly. 

In connection with the question of 
modification of jobs to exclude women, 
McElroy said that changes in job 
descriptions must have the approval of 
Mr. Sisco. He commented that such 
changes occur rarely . 

As far as the 'entourage' problem is 
concerned, Paul Salt man, who is in 
charge of Affirmative Action im -
plementF :1 on the faculty side, 
described the practice as a "defensible 
management practice." The smooth 
functioning of the un iversity requires, in 
his view, a ' team' that has worked 
together before and that can function 
harmoniously. Ms. Frazer has asserted 
that such a practice opens in the door to 
ignoring Affirmative Action altogether in 
this area (exceptions can be claimed 
without hindrance as necessary to the 
harmonious function of the university) . 
Ms . Covell expressed the opinion that a 
compromise must be reached ; persons 
should be allowed to come along in an 

~ntourage as exceptions, but not in great 
numbers . 

I n connection with the assertion of 
holding period violations, McElroy said, 
"that's absolutely not true." The only 
time a h(llding period does not apply" is 
when Mr. Sisco grants an_ exception, 

Third College 
school di stricts. 

The before mentioned flexibility 
enters into Third's curriculum for 
students, explicitly sophomores, 
who are able to branch directly 
into many upper division courses 
after or during completion of the 
breadth requirements Amongst the 
conversations I have had With 
students at Third this ability to go 
into their major as sophomores 
constituted a I ~ r ge part of thei r 
liking for Third's AcademiC Plan 

To return tothe Ituatlon at hand 
however, rather the situation at 
large at UCSD, namely the con-
fusion amongst many Revelle and 
Muir students as to just what Third 
College is about, I would again IlkI' 
to stress the importance of 
ideology --of goal s--o f pur -
pose . A curriculum is judged on its 
performance as well as a pianist is 
judged for his . Yet , I admit no 
curriculum is innocent of not 
possessing certain emphasees, or 
attempting to produce graduates in 
these areas of emphasis. 

"Produce" is perhaps too com-
puter of a word. Stimulate would 
no doubt better befit the stimulus 
all colleges attempt to create in 
order to educate and spurn 
students to go out and try to solve 
the world 's problem s. Third ' s 
application the Minority Bio-
Medical program entered to the 
National Board of Health last year , 
represents yet a nother result of the 
college's desire to get qualified 
minorities out into professional 
scientific fields . For those 
unacquainted with the program, or 
the need for such a program, I 
point to the statistics reported in 
last year ' s Triton Times' article on 

which McElroy said is rare. 

cont. from p-2 

the Program A((orciing to cl 
National Sc ien ce roundatlOn 
Survey takE'n across the country In 
1970, less than 1 % of graduate 
students In t he natural sci ences 
were native born minorities 

Third has accepted a specific 
respon sibili ty for tile education of 
m ino rit ies . As st at ed In t he 
Academ ic Plan of the co llege "we 
have plannE'd a college dedicated 
to the educa tion of large numbers 
of m inori ty you ths who possess thE' 
Will and the potent lal to be com 
leading citize ns within thei r own 
communi t ies, to alleviate (on-
temporary SOCial and economic 
probl m s and , In dOing so , to 
provide public benefit to our 
society at large." 

So what are or should we be 
discussing readers : the misjudged 
quality of Third, or what the 
college is I feel it should be un-
necessary to state that the 1A and 
2A Math sequences at Third are the 
same as at Revelle ; that all the 
math courses are offered on a 
campus-wide basis, or that any 
class at Third has to be approved 
through the individual departments 
at UCSD, or that last year Katja 
lindenburg, a chem istry teacher at 
Third was given the outstanding 
Teacher Award from Revell e. 

I have no intention of glor ifying 
Third or exaggerating its actual 
curriculum. Third, l ike any other 
college is not for everyone; no 
college is meant to be that way. 
But, for what a College is trying to 
do, and doing, makes it worthy of 
some respect Thi rd should not be 
excluded from this respect. To 
bang a drum at a different beat 
than others does not mean that 
beat is off. 

In the area of growth opportunities, 
Chancellor McElroy said that )everal on-
the-job training programs have been 
initiated. In addition, a number of classes 
are being offered, such as How to Stop 
Descriminating Against Yourself . Ac -
cording to Ms. Frazer, the present 
tra ining program is inadequate, and 
priorities must be adjusted to allocate 
more funds for Affirmative Action.

department has Inst ituted 
an informal unoffi ci al 
program in which members 
of the department go out in 
the campus commun ity to 
communicate with the 
students. To this effect 
police off icers have been 
seen in c afeterias anJ 
lounges meeting and 
talking with students . 

One of the major problems is 'subtle 
crimination ', those forms of 

descnmination which, because of their 
nature, cannot be handled by Affirmative 
Action . Sisco gave as a hypothetical 
example the supervisor who says, " I' ll 
play the game, but I' ll figure a way to get 
around it" and proceeds to offer a 
rationalization for h is discriminatory 
actions . The solution, according to Sisco, 
is a basic attitudinal change among the 
people who act in this manner . 

One of the reasons for 
this attitude has been Hugh 
French, the new pol ice 
chief. According to 
Detective Gene Miller, 
Chief French has instituted 
a new enthusiasm for the 
police department to work 
harder for student-pol ice 
relations.
