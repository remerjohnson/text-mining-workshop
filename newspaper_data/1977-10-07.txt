Extra budget money 
misused, cha'rges Lee 
Whitehill disagrees, says mQlley 

~olstered key services and programs 
By Alan Russell 

Editor 
A charge of "misappropriation of fWlds" has been leveled against the 

administ rative staff of Student Affairs by Bert Lee, a former member of 
the Advisory Committee on Student Fee Programs (Reg. Fee). 

"Blatant allocations occurred this swnmer which I see no reasons for," 
said Lee. "What happened in short is that the administration of Student 
Affairs overlooked the recommendations of last year's Reg. Fee com-
mittee." 

Lee's statement refers to last year 's Reg. Fee Committee's expectation 
for a state allocation of $486,000. The committee, composed of seven 
students and five administrators, recommended that if additional funds 
were given they be "banked"-or at least retained until the committee 
could do further allocation studies. 

" What happened was that Student Affairs received $600,000, instead of 
without the consultation of the committee. 

Revelle fountain : haven for Heond week burn·out •. TT Photo Guzza "This is just one more case showing the poor judgement of the ad-
ministrative staff of Student Affairs and their historical malignancy for 
ex-post facto allocations." ASUCSD Veep replies to charges; 

No usurption of power intended 
Sindler gives" temporary resignation" 

BetrayalofTrust 
Ann Carberry, another member of last year's Reg. Fee committee, 

said she felt "totally betrayed by the whole matter." She stated that long 
hours of work had been invested in "good faith' by the committee, with 
the end result being time wasted-and more. 

" What the new budget did was allocate some things we on the com-
mittee had never evaluated, discussed or eveg considered," said Car-

-rerry. To this day there hasn't even been any written justification made 
by Laura A. Richter

" It would be fallacious to deny 

that the discussion groups 
existed," said Mark Sindler, ad-
dressing charges that he surre~ 
titiously organized a series of 
exclusive meetings this summer at 
Mesa apartments in order to 
establish a core group of power 
within the ASUCSD (TT, Wed-
nesday , Oct. 5). 

Sindler, AS vice-president , 
claimed, however, that only one 

In a late development at last 
night ' s AS meeti.ng, Vice-
President Mark Sindler an-

. nounced his inability to perform 
his duties due to a variety of 
pressures. He will relinquish his 
duties indefinitely. 

Slndler's position as chair-
person ef the ASUCSD council 
will be filled by Commissioner 
of Communications David 
Eisen, who was elected 
President Pro Tempore in 
June by the council. 

Sindler explained to the 
council last night thai school 
and AS related pressures have 
made it impossible to continue 
as vice-president. He said that 
he " wasn't 8ure" of the duration 
of his semi-resignation. 

The Triton Times wlll..-ovide 
further coverage of last night's 
meeting on Monday, as well 88 
interviews with Slndler, Eisen 
and President Jeff LeUer. 

meeting was held and that the 
group met in an office in Student 
Organizations. 

" It was not a means for fonning 
a small elite within the govern-
ment, or for usurping the power of 
the president or that of the AS," 
stated Sindler. 

The purpose of the gatherings, 
refered to by student sources as 
"Wednesday Night Discussion 
Group Two," was to "fonnulate 
reports, to be circulated among 
members, about key issues coming 
up in the future," said Sindler. "It 
sounds siniater, .. he continued, 
" but there il nothing to be 
defensive about." 

SndIer refuted the accusation 
th. he recruited a aelect few AS 

commlsslOners and council 
representatives, saying that the 
persons who attended happened to 
be availab&e while- the remainder 
of the AS members were wOrking 
or traveling. Jeff Leifer, AS 
president , was attending a con-
ference ilt Gennany for which he 
had been granted UC fellowship 
money . 

" It was a group of people who 
had found in the past that they 
could work together well and who 
just decided to get the show on the 
road," remuked Sindler. He listed 
the newly reorganized Student 
Center Board , constitutional by-
law clarification and financial 
autonomy frpm Reg Fees as on the 
prioritized list of discussion topics. 

Finance committee met at Mesa 
The AS finance committee did 

meet at Mesa apartments, ad-
mitted Sindler, during an instance 
when the Student Organization 
offices were fOWld locked. 

Sindler responded to additional 
criticism leveled by Leifer, who 
said that as the chairperson of AS 
meetings , Sindler had allowed the 
situation to become chaotic. " I've 
been very, very wary about letting 
the council run at its own s~d. 
The new government may look 
hectic and unorganized, that's 
understandable. But people will 
begin to work together,". felt 
Sindler, adding that he does not 
wish to take on an authoritarian 
role . 

Experience which qualifies 
Sindler in his position as chair-
person of AS coWlcil meetings, he 
said, began with his participatioQ 
in his high school AS and continued 
when he became active in the 
Coop. 

" Everyone has his own per· 
spective of what the AS should be, " 
Sindler continued, saying that 
Coop members are used to stan-
ding up and shouting at meetings. 
"But in my mind ," he stated, 
"everything is carefully planned. II 

Sindler countered each of 
Leifer's accusations but was not 
vindictive when referring to the 
relatiOlllhlp between the president 
and himself. "We came from 
oppoeiJII caaq.w during the elec-
tions," he reflected, "1Mj we talked 

and were good acquaintances." He to the committee explaining the entire process." , 
said that both were surprised that Assistant Vice~hancellor of Student Affair s Richard Whitehill, 
each had won the election of their responding from his position as administrative co~hair of Reg. Fee, said 
respective offices, but that the two that Lee's claim of "misappropriation" is "inappropriate." 
were committed to working " My view is that it 's quite appropriate," said Whitehill. "Mr. Lee and I 
compatibly together. agree to disagree .':

Mark Sindler 
Sindler stated, he would like to 
make it known that Leifer was not 
his choice for president. " Now I 
fully support him because he was 
duly elected." Nor was Sindler a 
supporter of the AS previous to the 

[Continued on page 2] 

had been " reappropriated-not misappropriated." 
" Approximately $40,000 of the money went to obligations that neither 

the committee nor the Vic~hancellor's office was aware of," said 
Whitehill . "The other $60,000 went to bolster programs we thought 
required additional support." 

Whitehill said that the additional allocation will " not lead directly to a 
fee increase, nor will the end of the year reserve position be altered." 

More Benefit 
Taking the approach that the allocations would "yield greater social 

benefits" .and thus be more advantageous to students than off-setting 
fisca l costs, Whitehill said that the banking of the money would only have 
saved the students $6 per year. 

The Qlcnotom painted by the opposing sides is one of seeking either 
additional student services or smaller Reg. Fee payments. Lee's main 
concern , though , is that the rising fees "are just building on to the base 
bureaucracy," and the Student Affairs is "allocating indiscriminately, 
with the figures belying their rhetoric of an era of limited growth." 

Contradicting this, Whitehill stated, "We're actually spending very 
little on increases." He added, " There are a nwnber of programs we'd 
like to st rengthen, with many needing new resources, but we don't have 
the money. Our budget is very tight. " 

Whatever the case, Bert Lee remains angry . " Students are payin 
more than is necessary," said Lee. " $232 is not needed." 

Day Care Center funding sources remain unclear; 
Surveys used to assess demand 

by Andy Schneider 
Associate News Editor 

l This is the second article in a 
four part series on day care. 
The first article entitled " Kids 
Left Waitlng: Day Care Center 
May Be Force To Close Its 
Doors" was printed on Sept. 23. 
The next article wtU seek out 
major opponents and sup-
porters of day care and will ask 
"Is day care the responsibiUty 
of the University? To wbat 
extent .... uld tbe University 
commit resources to this ser-

vtc~?" ] 
" Our day care center is ex-

pensive. We have a learning 
program of quality for our 
children. It is obvious that we 
don't have the space or the 
funding to meet the demand.", 
explained MaryaM Herbenar, 
awr of the UC San Diego Day 

Care Steering Committee. 
How to find the fu nding to 

keep the center open remains 
Wlclear. The campus will need 
to find $40,000 to cover the 
operating dificit expected for 
1978-79. 

Herbenar stressed the team 
effort of taff, students, faculty 
and administrat ion in 
"bra instorming for solutions 
that will avert the long range 
financial question, so we don 't 
have to hassle from year to year 
wondering if day care will 
survive". 

The Day Care Committee 
recently dis tr ibuted 4,500 
surveys through the campus 
mail to fac ulty and staff, as well 
as another 10,000 printed for 
students in the campus media 
last Monday. This day care 
needs assesment is not a vote, 

but will be used by the com-
mittee to docwnent the demand 
for the service. It will also in-
dicate a campus feeling for who 
should be responsible for day 
care and by what means the 
fees paid by parents might be 
subsidized . 

In an attempt to provide not 
only for short term fund raising 
but also a long term fiscal 
management approach, the 
Day Care Committee has 
establi!:hed an ad hoc options

Bible alienating 

I'm sure you have had some exposure to the Bible, either In 8' church, in 
a classroom, or amongst your family and friends. I would also bet that 
much of this experience with the "Good Book" has been impersonal, and 
often rather alienating. 

You probably feel that as a Christian I have a special stake in this book, 
especially concerning its nature and relevance to us. 

I must admit you're right. 

It is God's "love-letter" to me which directs every facet of my life, and 
when pressed I would surely defend it. Yet I'm not interested in grinding 
some intellectual, theological axe , but rather in providing you with an 
opportunity to have a positive and personal encounter with the content

Towards this end, some of my friends and I will be offering Bible 
studies at various times and places on campus. Now, this isn 't a time for 
us to lecture or preach to you, but rather a time for us to come together 
and address ourselves to the task of understanding this book : to see what 
it means historically and what it can personally mean to us . 

Let's get together ! 
It won't be a horrible or threatening time, but should be most rewar-

ding and rather fun ! .

Childhood memories revived Allegro Non tropo: 
by Debbie Schwartz 
Contributing Editor 

The last time I played musical 
chairs was at Paula's birthday 
party when we were in fourth 
grade. Marcy . and Bobby 
scrambled for the last chair at the 
same time. The chair fell over and 
so did they. They both got a prize. I 
got a prize for pin-the-tail-oo-the-
donkey. 

If there's one thing we all have in 
eorrunon. it's mertories like these 

from childhood . And one thing that 
always brings that warm, " we're 
all only human , after aU" feeling to 
any situation is sharing those 
memories . But, reminiscence is 
only one aspect of the exhibit en-
titled "The Fonnative Year," 
which opened the new season at 
" The Other Gallery" and has been 
on display all this week. 

The exhibit displays the work of 
four second-year UCSD visual-art5

Dance .closses around town 
-by JlII Louis Bazeley 

Staff Writer 
If you tried but failed to get into one of UC San Diego's few dance 

classe s, don 't despair. There still may be hope for the adventurous 
student. 

At very little (lost, the San Diego parks and recreation department 
offer s a carnival of regularly scheduled adult dance classes from 
classical ballet to "strictly" Balkan. Prices per class run from 25 cents to 
$1, but most conventional classes such as ballet, jazz, modem, tap and 
belly dance are $5 for ten lessons. Some legwork is involved in getting 
down to Balboa Park, but for the price, it's worth the effort. 

other classes available are various International folk dance classes , 
competitive and social ballroom dancing, English country dancing, 
Scottish country dancing, highland dancing, Mexican folk dancing and 
round dancln~ which is, according to coordinator Pat Coe, American 
ballroom steps to popular music songs such as " Mexicali Rose. " More 
infonnation about all the classes can be obtained from Mary Culver, 
Cultural Events, 236-a05. . 

Known flatteringly as the San Diego Civic Youth Ballet, the ballet 
classes are held In by far the biggest ballet classroom in San Diego. 
Unfortunately, there can be as many as 40 people in ~ class, but the large 
room and many mlrrors more than compensate for the crowd. Live plano 
acCOlllpfniment, excellent teaching and interesting people characterize 
ballet in Balboa Park. 

Says Jeanette Stevelll, one of the more ' ezper;enced dancers In the 
Intermediate class, "it's a total experience - the caUber fA the teaching, 
the fadUty, the environme~ . " "The people here," aelda Edna Tulin, " are 
nice ." 

Other popular dance schools In Sen Diego are The San Diego Ballet, 
Stage 7, La Jolla Dance Center and The California Ballet, but these are 
not for dancers with tight budgeta or weak competitive spirits. For 
example, if instead of going up Into a magnificent cabriole from fifth you 
wind up on the noor In sixth (from the Gennan "sitz") you might feel a 
bit uncomfortable at some schools. But at the parks and recreation 
department, It's all In the fun. 

is of an autobiographical nature; 
captwing the cha rm, curiosity, 
turmoil and sensitivity of growing 
up. 

Heid i Hardin explores the 
duality of individual space vs. 
group portrait of her second grade 
class. The faces a nd clothing of 
herself and her fellow classmates 
are depicted with only enough 
detail to define the uniqueness of 
features and gesture of each in-
dividual. From afar , her 
predominantly soft and muted 
colors blend to form an intriguing 
collective ident'ity. A book con-
taining oil renderings of individ ual 
classmates and short descriptions 
or related incidents concerning 
each accompanies the painting. 
Hardin 's other paintings deal with 
fa mily s ituations. Each person is 
placed in a separate, defined plane 
within the space of the painting. 
Some of the paintings even go so 
far as to physically set apart the 
family members through the use of 
panels and intervening spaces. 
Hardin's style of painting lends 
another dimension to the idea of 
individual/group duality. Her 
brushstrokes are free and ex-
pressive, although confined within 
the forms they create , just as the 
people in her paintings retain their 
individuality despite the context of 
the group to which they belong. 

Laraine Mestman presents the 
story of her life in the fann of 
photographs, small pho~ books, 
and a family album. "2 or 3 Things 
I Know About her" la a "sad, but 
true" photographic narrative 
describing the surgery forced upon 
her by a mother detennlned to 
eradicate the smallest incidence of 
physical imperfection In her yOlDlg 
daughter. The poses and facial 
expressions of the photographs 
portray the sentiments of a child 
whose face " even a mother

Left.flanders also learn to adapt. 
I goUed right-lumded as a child - I 
didn't know that left-handed clubs 
existed. When I first picked up a 
guitar I was lnfonned that I was 
not holding it correctly. I turned it 
around and thought no more of it. 
Along the way I also came to bat 
right-handed and kick rlght-footed.

Back to last Friday night. UFO 
and Rush, two up-anckoming 
heavy metal bands from the third 
or fourth generation (years from 
the Yardbirds) played their stuff. 
UFO, the first group to play, 
supplied a utilitarian proficiency to 
the affair. Guitarist Mike Shenker 
was · the focal point, running his 
fingers up and doWn the frets in a 
mad scurry of notes . However, 
Shenker has no style whatsoever; 
his phrasing, patterns and 
dynamic emphasis have been 
ripped off from any num~r of 
known and unknown guitar 
slingers. Also, he has no feeling for 
the blues . That in itself'isn 't a high 
crime, but some dimension of 
humanity in this largely inhwnan 
terrain would have been welcome. 

There are many injustices we 
left-handers bear. Uvilization has 
evolved for the right-hander : 
symbols of greeting and salutation 
are usually carried out with the 
right hand ; appliances and 
equipment like wristwatches and 
turntable tone-anns are right-hand 
oriented; hand extensions such as 
ladles and dinnerware are 
designed and displayed for the 
convenience of the chauvinistic

Jonathan Richman: .Music of life Muir College Elections BY Mikel Toombs 
Rock 'n' RoD with tbe Modern 
wvera - Jonathan Richman at 
the Modem Lovers Cult figures 
as a rule are pretty odd, but 
Jonathan Richman has got to be 
one of the oddest. His vocals 
give evidence of a severe sinus 
condition, bnt alnce he baa only 
a 4 and one third-note range it 
probably doesn't matter. What 
doeS matter Is that Richman 
seems to have experienced a 
case of arrested development, 
leaving him unable (or un-
willin8) to CI'Oll8 the threshold 
into adulthood. On his first 
album RictmaD brilllantly (and 
at titnes painfully) explored his 
childlike persona; on his second 
he crudely tried to exploit it; 
and on his third he appears to 
have finaUy come to lenns with 
it. 

Rock'n'RolI With Ibe Modern 
Lovers Is not what you would 
call a chaUenging album: it 
plumbs no great emotional 
depths and being entirely 
acoustic it stretches the 
definition of rock'n'roU quite a 
bit. Simply staled, Rock'o'RoU 
is an effective expression of an 
innocent, cheerful view of life. 
Richman finds joy in the basic 
things around him, things that 

of us take for granted-

swnmer breezes, insects, city 
streets, shopping centers. 

At his most trivial, when he 
sings about toose things that are 
magical to children-such as 
leprechauns and ice cream 

men~ sonp are nice and 
neat and cute, but that's about 
it. When he goes all-out to be 
funny, as on "Dodge Veg-O-
Matic," he Is much more suc-
cessful. "Dodge Veg-O-Matic" 
is a very clever saga of a 
completely-worthless car that 
he Is trying to unload, although 
not too eagerly, beca\lle "I like 
thia car a lot. " 

But Richman Is at his best 
when he Is being most seriOUII, 
celebrating day-to-day life with 
reverence and simplicity · (for 
him nothing is complicated). 
"Summer Morning" and 
"Afternoon" find him reveling 
in a beauty of nature, coming 
dangerously close to the self-
indulgence that ruined his 
second album, but emerging 
with positive and valid 
statements of his peculiar 
obsession. , 

The standout here is " F1y Into 
. The Mystery ." As he conveys a 

magnificent f~eling for his 
native Boston, Richman 
wonders innocently about those 
who are flying " into life's 

mystery ," a journey he makes 
seem like a mystical e' -
perience- and of course for him 
it is . Call it naive , call it simple-
minded, call it anything you 
like-it's Jonathan Richman, it 's 
unique 'and it 's great.

Book" is an extensive family 
album of drawings, clippings. a nd 
snapshots accompanied by a text. 

Marge Dean and Brad Stensberg 
use video as the medium for their 
messages. Their skillfully shot and 
edited videotapes are viewable in a 
comfortable "sitting room" area in 
the gallery . 

"Personalized Checks by Dean" 
deals with the impact of money and 
finance on a child growing up in a 
capitalistic society. How many of 
us have learned the art of com· 
petition by financial reinforcement 
for good grades? The visual 
destruction of old personalized 
checks is an effective manner of 
describing the class oppression 
discussed in the narrative. Another 
of Dean's videotapes. " The 
Autobiography of My Sister Who Is 
Still in High School". gets un· 
derway as a letter to Marge from 
her sister Claire, who has "senior 
clump in her junior year." A dif· 
ferent kind of class oppression is 
portrayed here . classroom op-
pression. Claire talks about how 
little stimulation is provided by her 
classes and teachers as she 
repeatedly performs an almost 
mindless activity for the duration 
of the tape. Along with other 
autobiographical tapes, Dean also 
provides a book on "How to Make a 
Great Family." This magazine 
presents "do it yourself projects 
that will work anywhere in your 
house" and makes one realize what 
a chore living with other people 
can be. 

If you prefer " situation 
comedies," you can change the 
channel to a videotape by Brad 
Stensberg. Not that his work 
should, by any means. be com· 
pared to anything like " Rhoda" or 
" All's Fair", but his situations are 
quite fwmy . In "Hello California," 
an old friend from his home state of 
Wisconsin pays Stensberg a visit. 
The differences between California 
and Wisconsin are floundered with 
and Stensberg " elegantly" models 
various fashio"lsJ to the Beach Boy 
tune. " Califol"1ia Girls." " M&M" 
tells the tale 0: I10w his experience 
of eating M&:Ms was ruined by the

exactly what :.he title suggests· a

Olsen returns 
Guess who's baseball coach (again)? 

by Mark S&acDer 
While professional baseball 

turns its attention Lo the post· 
season playoffs this week, UCSO's 
baseball team Is already looking 
forward to next sealOll. with a new 
coach who looks very familiar. 

Lyle Olsen, a San Diego State 
University physical education 
professor who has led the Triton 
baseball team for the past five 
years, has returned to the 
managerial post for one more 
season. 

Olsen retired after last season, 
citing personal reason. but when 
Athletic Director Judy Sweet was 
unable to find a successor who met 
UCSD's specifications, she asked 
Olsen to be his own successor. 

Enjoys Coaeblng 
"When I left last year. I assured 

Judy that if she couldn't get anyone 
for the job I'd come back for one 
more year," Olsen said Wed-
nesday. I'm happy to do so. I enjoy 
coaching baseball. 

" I'd retired because I've got a lot 

of other commitments. But I knew 
I could delay my sabbatical to 
Europe one more year," Olsen 
said. 

Sweet said she had a hard time 
finding a qualified person whose 
schedule could fit into the part time 
nature of the UCSO baseball 
coaching position. 

"We feel very fortmate we could 
get Lyle back for another year." 
she added. 

Olsen returns to a team he feels 
will be very competitive next 
season, with a good player at every 
position. The Tritons have ten 
players returning from last year's 
12-24 team, and several good-
looking prospects appeared at the 
first practice last week, Olsen said. 

Whether the team does sub-
stantially better than last year 
remains up in the air. UCSD has 8 
low·key, low·budget athletic 
department that does no recruiting 
and gives no scholarships. It. 
however, competes against schools 
which do both. 
... 

, , 

Still, Olsen blamed last year's 
record on " mostly poor roaching, 
to tell the truth. I blew the pivotal 
six to ten games by playing people 
out of position and that turned the 
season around. because we had a 
good team. " 

Infielder Dave Youngdale, who 
has played on the team for the past 
three years, gave a different 
reason for the Tritons' poor 
showing. 

"We didn 't have any offense last 
year. We had good pitching but we 
needed a shutout or a One-run 
game from the pitchers to win," 
Youngdale said. " This year we'll 
have a good defense and some 
pitching. but you can only hope for 
a better offense." 

Youngdale also pointed to 
inexperience on last year's team. 
saying the 1977 Tritons started 
several freshmen who should be 
helped by a year's playing ex· 
perience. 

Coacblng Pbilosophy 
/ Olsen said he does not like the 

highly commercial and com-
, petitive nature of sports at places 

like San Diego State and so is glad 
to be roaching a team at UCSD. 

His coaching philosophy mat-
ches those feelings. He tries to let 

, his players make most of the 
decisions connected with the team 
and even lets his returning players 
figure out which 20 players receive 

, team uniforms. 
(Olsen explained that while no 

players are actually cut from the 
team, the school only owns 20 
baseball uniforms.)

children of the town. 
With this in mind. I humbly 

suggest that, during this, the 99th 
year before the American 
Tricentennial, the Muir Five and 
Dime Restaurant be renamed the 
Alfered E. Packer Memorial Grill, 

I further suggest a picture of 
Packer be placed above the grill.

"UCSD students are bright 
enough to know what's going on on 
the field and to make decisions fo r 
the team." Olsen said. 

Youngdale referred to Olsen's 
coaching style , saying last season 
the younger players didn't really 
understand the way Olsen operated 
with the team. 

"This ypar we 'll 1111 know what

he expects from us," Youngdale 
said. 

The team will continue to 
practice on an informal basis three 
times a week, until regular 
practices start in January. It will 
also play in a Winter League 
against other area colleges. The 
regular season starts in February .

UCSD opened the scoring at the five minute mark of the first half when 
an Aztec player miued his defensive assignment. On an out«J(.:oounds 
thrown-in, Doug Youngdale saw teamate Mike Schein all alone near the 
SDSU goal. Tbe wide open Schein took the throw in from YDllII8dale and 
rifled it into the net for the Triton'. first goal of the season. 

SDSU Ued the game seven minutes later on ita first shot-oo g~1 of the 
game. Aztec forward Rene Miramontes took a centering pass and kicked 
the ball over the outstretched arms of goali~Brian Healey . . 

Four minIltea later, stale took the lead when Miramontes took a shot 
that went wide to the right and fed it to Vidal Fernandez, who put the ball 
into an open net. On the play, goalie Healey was dr"wn out of position by 
the IniUal shot, leaving the left side of the goal open. 

State's All-American halfback Alan Kelley closed the scoring by 
knuckling in a free kick with seven minutes left in the half, Tbe goal was

The second half, although ~~oreless, contained some outstanding 
defense play by UCSD. State took seven shots on goal in the last 45 minute 
stanza, but goalie Tim MDrphy, who replaced Healey, stopped them all. 
Morphy, who toured England this swnmer playing goalie for the 
Southern California Condors, continually thwarted State's highpowered 
offense with thr~e dazzling saves. 

Even though SDSU scored three times, coach Steward Hayes was 
impressed with his team's defensive performance. "I think it just took a 
half to wann up and get over the jittery feeling that comes when you're 
playing a team like this," Hayes remarked. "At halftime, we talked more 
about positional play. The players covered better in the second half. We 
did something very different today. We were play~g very defensively." 

The Tritons were getting back on defense much more quickly in the 
second half. Backs Turken and Russell Crane stopped the Aztecs 
throughout the second half on scoring drives. However, UCSD managed 
only two shots on goal in the last 

SOCCER NOTES- UCSD left for Berkeley last night for today's first 
round game in the All-Cal tourney with fourth seeded UC Davis. UCLA, 
seeded first «s usual, is not in the Triton's bracket, making a second or 
third place finish in the tournament highly possible.
