Co-Op Refuses ' 
To Sell Cigarettes 
In Smokeout Day 
Nationally-recognized day 
prompts campus store to act 
IIJ PARISA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

:Ine Student Co-op General Store joined 
the nation in recognizing the Great American 
SmokeOut by not selling any tobacc products 
last Thursday. 

The Great American SmokeOut is a day 
when many stores do not sell cigarettes and 
numerous programs occur, aimed at educating 
smokers about the dangers of smoking and the 
benefits of quitting.

Roosevelt alumnus and member of the 
General Store, George Gonzalez, said the 
members of the co-op wanted to recognize 
National Great American SmokeOut to show 
their support for those quitting. 

"It is to show we do support nonsmoking 
programs, and at the same time that we sup-
port a smoker'~ right to smoke," Gonzalez said. 
"This was a way we could do both." Dynes Recognizes Volunteers 
â€¢ Currently, the General Store is the only 
store on campus where students can purchase 
cigarettes. According to Gonzalez, the store

UCSD's 40th anniversary ceremony commemorates 
decades of campus outreach and community involvement 
By JlUlCA KRUSKAMP 
Staff Writer 

A reception in the Price Center Ballroom 
Thursday recognized faculty, students and 
staff involved in community service as part of 
a year-long program to acknowledge UCSD's 
40th anniversary. 

The ceremony commemorated the Board 
of Regents' decision to establish a campus on 
the former San Diego army base on Nov. 18, 
1960. On display was a 40-year timeline, 
memory boards dedicated to each decade and 
a video presentation of UCSD in the 1960s. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes began the cere-
mony at 3 p.m. by welcoming 130 guests. 
Among the attendees were Herbert York, 
UCSD's first chancellor and current diversity 

council chairman, as well as Hugo Fisher, a 
former senator and co-author of the Master 
Plan for Higher Education, who was also 
responsible for securing governmental funds 
for the creation of UCSD. 

Dynes commented that although it is a rel-
atively young university, UCSD has done well 
in establishing itself as a fine institution. The 
2000 U.S. News and Wllrld Repllrt ranked 
UCSD seventh nationally among public uni-
versities. The Irwin and joan jacobs School of 
Engineering was ranked ninth among schools 
of its type. 

The 40-year observance's theme, "Giving 
Back to the Community: was inspired by all 
who volunteer, according to Dynes. 

See ANNIVERSARY, Page 2 

He also said that for the most part, people 
were understanding as to why the General 
Store would not allow cigarettes to be pur-
chased on that day. . 

The fact that it was not selling cigarettes did 
not deter many smokers from smoking. 

Warren sophomore David Lee laughed 
when he learned he could not buy cigarettes at 
the General Store. 

"Oh, my God, this is just wrong: Lee said, 
shaking his head in disbelief. 

Lee said he would now have to go off cam-
pus to get cigarettes. 

One customer ye.lled at the cashier when he 
was told he could ,not buy cigarettes. 

. "Are you going to tell me when to smoke?"

Festival Celebrates'Latin Culture 
Singers and dancers help create awareness at UCSD 
B, PATRICK UI 
Contributing News Writer 

UCSD's first LatinFest commenced at 11 a.m. 
Friday in the Price Center Pla7.3. 

The festival was a free, all-ages event that wel-
comed both students and nonstudents. 

The event began with a daytime festival in the 
Price Center Plaza, featuring cultural entertain-
ment and information. The Latin Fest shared a 
time slot with the university'S 40th birthday cele-
bration, and provided musical accompaniment 
for the cutting of UCSD's giant birthday cakes. 

The entertainment was comprised of Latin 
musicians and dance groups, including Salsa y 
Fuego, one of San Diego's professional dance 
companies. 

"They wen: awesome; said Revelle freshman 
Gina Tesconi. "I'd love to see them again." 

The festival ran until 4 p.m. The LatinFest 
went on hiatus befon: opening again in the Price 
Center Ballroom with a concert and dance, fea-

turing more Latin Djs and musicians. 
The festival featured musicians and perform-

ers of varying Latin backgrounds, and their per-
formances ranged from hip-hop to harpists. 

Michaela lzaguire, a Marshall junior, spoke 
highly of the day. 

"The idea behind today's event, I think, was to 
offer aspects of Latin culture to be soaked up by 
the UCSD community: she said" "What better 
way to share one's culture than to come out and 
celebrate it with an audience." 

The LatinFest will be back next year with more 
entertainment and the same community focus. 
Organizers of the event and audience members 
alike said they recommend that anyone interested 
should attend. 

Francesca Cabrillo, a senior who enjoyed a 
piece of UCSD's birthday cake during the Latin 
celebration, spoke out for the event. 

"Latin culture is colorful, and it's alive: 
Cabrillo said. "It's fun to learn about and this 
event is good proof of that fact ."

Senior Vice Chancellor Marsha 
Chandler spoke about the Extended 
Studies for Outreach Program, found-
ed in the 1960s as a way for volunteers 
to offer support in the community. 
According to Chandler, this program 
strengthens the university. 

"We can all take enormous pride as 
we look at the range and depth of the 
programs that we have here at UCSD: 
Chandler said. "The Straight Student 
Volunteers are students who are heal-
ing the community, but also helping 
themselves by going outside of their 
own interests and spending time with 
others, which is the time that maners 
the most." 

Clark Kerr, then-president of the 
University of California, said at 
UCSD's 25th anniversary that " the 
advance of [UCSDJ to a peak position 
among the 3,200 institutions of high-
er education in the United States is 
one of the few academic marvels in all 
history. No other major American uni-
versity has ever grown so remarkable 
both in quantity and in quality at the 
same time, and in so short a time." 

York agreed. 
He spoke about how UCSD was 

originally named UC La Jolla . The 
naming became so controversial, 
according to York, that newspapers 
coined the name "UC Here." 

According to Fisher, UCSD was 
officially named in 1960 when he was 
asked his opinion at a town meeting. 
The name UC San Diego was' chosen 
because La Jo\\a is a community of 
San Diego. 

According to Fisher, UCSD "went 
on to become one of the greatest uni-
versities in the nation. 

"/ am proud ofwhat it has become, 
and it is a wonderful idea to put the 
40th an niversary together with the 
community service aspect of the col-
lege: he said. "The volunteer work is 
instrumental in why UCSD is such a 
fine school." 

The program. represented by the 
motto "Celebrating 40 Years of 
Education, Service and Discovery," 
will encompass over 300 activities and 
40 events beginning ov. 21. 

UCSD TV will televise two half-
hour video segments about UCSD's 
40 years. The first will detail the past, 
and the second will include an inter-
view with Dynes about the future. 

"We care about the well-being of 
this community because we are a part 
of it: Dynes said. "The only way that 
that happens is the time you take to 
make it happen. 

"We are a great university and fare] 
becoming even greater because of you, 
and we can make the next 40 years 
even bener than the past 40 years."

ETCETERA 

BRIEFLY 
UCSD arid Children's Hospital to Unite 

The UC Regents have endorsed an agreement 
to Integrate a children's health program at 
Children 's Hospital to create a worlcklass cen-
ter for pediatric care, research and teaching in 
the final stage of discussions between physi-
cians and administrators from UCSD and 
Cbildren's Hospital. 

Combining UCSD's pediatnc services with 
those of Children's Hospital would enhance the 
repute of both parties and would allow both 
institutions to continue attracting the best pedi-
atricians and pediatric researchers. It would 
also allow extended community-based program-
ming and outreach. 

The agreement is an extension of collabora-
tions which are already taking place between 
the two institutions. Both have successfully 
established numerous joint patIent care, teach-
ing and research programs_ 

Plans for the integration include pr9visions to 
establish new research facilities at the 
Children's Hospital site in addition to continuing 
and extending collaborSltion among researchers 
and clinicians developing improved diagnostic 
and treatment approaches to childhood disease_ 

Regents Approve Plan to Admit 
More Graduate Students 

The University of California approved a bud-
get last Thursday that focuses on expanding 
UC's contributions to the California economy, 
improving student access to a UC education and 
preserving high quality teaching, research and 
public service_ 

UC's state-funded operating budget would 
rise 7.7 percent to 3.45 billion under the budget 
plan_ The university's total budget, which 
reflects funds from all sources, inc luding federal 
funds for the three national laboratories man-
aged by UC, would be approximately $15.7 bil-
lion_ Excluding the labs, the total budget would 
be approximately $12.5 billion. 

The university'S state budget request is built . 
on a Â· partnership agreement" reached this year 
with Gov. Gray Davis. The partnership provides 
for predictable annual increases in state General 
Fund support for UC, along with the university's 
commitment to meeting accountability goals in 
specific areas of performance, which the univer-

Regents Make Decilion to 
Admft More Graduate Students 

In an effort to maintain California's econom-
ic growth and the university's role in the state's 
economy, the University of California announced 
Thursday that it would meet the state's future 
workforce needs by enrolling an additional 
11,000 graduate students to the UC system in 
the next ten years_ 

The University of California will employ several 
tactics to facilitate its goal to spread the extra 
graduate students across its ten campuses. These 
include increased funding dedicated to research 
assistantships as research grants and contracts 
grow, including state-funded research initiatives 
proposed in the 2001-02 budget; more funding for 
teaching assistantships as undergraduate enrol~ 
ments grow; increased fee waivers for research 
assistants and teaching assistants, consistent 
with the university's contract with the union repre-
senting UC teaching assistants; and examination 
by UC of other opportunities to a~ment graduate 
student financial support from other university fund 
sources, such as student fees and private gifts. 

UC Regents Act to Improve 
Employee 5a.arles, BenefIts 

The UC Board of Regents approved a budget 
Thursday that would significantly improve wages 
and benefits for UC employees by increasing 
salaries that are not keeping up with the market-
place and by expanding UC's child care program. 

The UC Regents also announced the approval 
of a program that would expand eligibility for UC .. 
retirement benefits to "casual" employees. 

This is the second year that the Regents 
have made actions in an effort to attract and 
retain qualified and talented personnel. 

Among the specific improvements to help 
institute the changes are an average 2 percent 
employee salary increase, merit increases for eli-
gible employees and a 1 percent parity increase 
to keep faculty salaries market~ompetitlve . .' 

The University of California is also proposing 
a plan that would grant Â·casual" employees 
Â·career status after reachIng the 1,OOOhour 
threshold at which they would also be able to 
accumulate retirement benefits in accordance 
with the new budget.

4 OPINION 

E 

Drinkers and drinking in general are 
more annoying than cigarettes 

By ALEX J. LIE 
Senlor Staff Wrlter 

It's time for me to set ' the record straight. With 
any luck, the age-old debate will finally be put to 
rest. I've said it Defore, and I'll say it again: Drinkers 
are more annoying than smokers. 

To understand why I feel the way I do is to 
understand that while growing up, 1 have known 
many drinkers. Whether they have been close 
friends, or even family members who would get a lit-
tle tipsX now and then, drinkers have been a staple 
of my life. In fact, I recall a picture of myself as a tod-
dler proudly holding a Bud in my tiny hands. 

I have also shared the company of plenty a smok-
ers. most notably my father, who could not shake the 
habit until my family finally made him qUit after 
nearly 20 years. Being Korean, it's a wonder I did not 
pick up smoking the minute I hit puberty. AJas, 1 
can't say the same for some of my peers, many of 
whom light up as often as they eat a meal. 

Needless to say, I've had my share of alcohpl and 
cigarettes. Easy access is truly an understatement 
when it comes to finding the stuff on campus. While 
no clear-cut distinction exists between drinkers and 
smokers - and indeed many people do both - a 
smoker is still more tolerable than a drinker. 

No doubt, students are shaking their heads right 
now, either in disbelief or disgust. They are probably 
wondering how I could conclude that drinkers are 
the worse of the two groups. Before I continue my 
little diatribe, however,l must admit that.even smok-

Cigarettes' clouds of smoke prove to be 
too aggravating 

Contributing Opinion Writer 

Anyone remember tbe anti-cigarette advertise-
ment from a few years ago warning that kissing a 
chain smokc:r is like licking an aShtray? Well, that is 
not quite accurate. It is more like kissmg the exhaust 
pipe of a bus, or so [ hear. 

You do not need to spend intimate time with the 
rear end of a big, fat monster thundering down 
Genesee (and yes, rm talking about the bus) to 
understand what I mean. Whether it is while stand-
ing in a crowdtd line, wading through Ridge Wlilk at 
noon or eating outside at the Price Center, we have 
all had to gag on someonc's smoke. 

Come on guys. I know you think it's really cool and 
all, but can't you at least sneak off to some nice. iso-
lated little nook in the middle of nowhere for the sake 
of the 99.9 percent of us who disagree with you? 

My all-time favorite anti-smoking sentiment was 
during an '80s wrestling telecast when -ROwdy' 
Roddy Piper politely asked a gentleman to put OUt 
his cigarette and his request was promptly answered 
with a puff of smoke in his face. Well, Piper decided 
to put it out for him by spraying him with a fire 
extinguisher. 

Now, even though I said that Was one of the fun-
niest things I have ever seen, don't think I am 
~flcouraging such rash behavior; it is pretty harsh to 
spray someone with a fire extinguisher. That is why 
Il'tCOmmcnd using a gardtn hose instead. 

Thbacco is not the only thing smoked around 
here. Let's not forget the cigarette's wayward cousin,

A Mockery of America's Status The Revival of Alternative 
Media is on the Way Because of the confusion surrounding the presidential 

elections, the world mocks the United States' politics Once thought dea~, altemativ~ media 
on campus IS comIng to promInence 

Arnel 
SaUl 

ARNEl GUIANG 
Even though most Americans 

and students are reluctant about 
voting, I'm glad I voted. [ am espe-
cially content that I voted this time 
because I feel like I made a differ-
ence in the state of our powerful 
union. 

For all of you who did not 
vote, I hope you feel that next 
time you really should do it. You 
can make a significant difference. 
Voting is the way we do things. 
The process of voting has dis-
crepancies, but it is highly reli-
able in determining the will of 
the people. Voting is one of the 
only privileges a simple citizen 
has. We should be exercising that 
privilege at all times. 

The important issue at hand 
here is . the presidency of the 
United States. I voted for the next 
commander in chief of the Unit-
ed States armed forces. I give a lot 
of respect to the office of the 
president. I consider the United 
States to be a modern Roman 
Empire. Voting for the next pres-
ident is like voting for the next 
Caesar. 

For examrle, I voted for the 
guy who wil have the power to 
nuke any country he pleases. I 
voted for the single guy who can 
veto any legislative bill that hun-
dreds of Congressmen put togeth-
er. I had a say in the quality and 
standards of life for the next four 

y.ears. I voted for the guy who can 
use the Oval Office for sexual 
pleasure. I voted for the guy who 
gets to own Air Force One and 
whom Harrison Ford portrayed. I 
voted for the most powerful man 
in the world. 

Who ever expected this elec-
tion crap to happen? I thought 
we had a systematic, flawless 
process of electing a president. 
The election process that we have 
become accustomed to seems to 
have come to a standstill. None 
of us ever expected a close race to 

Credibiliry in political 
affairs is like the value 
of the dollar: We want

be determined by courts ot by 
overseas absentee ballots. Who 
ever thought that the people 
determining the next president 
would be the people who were 
fed up with the country and had 
moved away? 

We are all used to a race being 
determined by a huge sum of 
votes. But look what happened: 
We still do not know who the next 
president is. The presidential tran-
sition process needs to be credi-
ble, and at this moment it is not as 
credible as before. In the eyes of 
foreign nations, our election 
process is not as worthy as it was 
before. Credibility in political 
affairs is like the value of the dol-
lar. We want both to be considered 
the world standard.

During the last couple of 
days, oth'er nations such as Rus-
sia and Cuba have offered to 
bring diplomats over to our 
country to ensure the election 
process in the United States is 
fairly conducted. They have 
some nerve to dare to set foot 
into the American democratic 
process. 

The British have ostracized the 
American democratic process. 
British comedians suggest joking-
ly that the U.S. Declaration of 

. Independence be repealed and 
that the British should appoint a 
foreign minister of affairs in 
America. 

This is bad. These invitations 
and jokes have highlighted how 
the American democratic system 
is now less credible than before. 
We are supposed to be the advo-
cators of a fair democracy. In the 
eyes of the people of otber 
nations, however, our democracy 
is not as perfect as before because 
of this election. 

The good things: Other coun-
tries are not sanctioning America. 
Americans are not in a civil war 
over the issue. 

The bad things: Russia and 
Cuba think our democracy is less 
credible, and can use that in their 
favor in diplomatic relations. The 
British are also making a mockery 
of American politics. 

I hope the transition to the 
next president preserves American 
credibility. I hope Americans 
remain the incontested world 
power for many years to come. I 
am proud of the democratic 
process. lam proud of voting, but 
I am worried about our credibility. 

By JACOB WAHIIIMAN 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

To hell with Florida. We all 
know the real source of . chaos, 
confusion and other horrid games 
you should not play with politics: 
the mainstream media. Taking 
more wrong turns on Nov. 7 than 
a freshman looking for Roosevelt 
College (why build a new one 
when no one can find the last 
one?). the television, print and 
brand-spank-them-new Internet 
journalists successfully eradicated 
any semblance of clarity in our 
electoral process. 

All through that quadruple-take 
of a night and the weeks since, I 
stay glued not to CNN or ABC, but 
PBS and the wonder of real infor-
mation, http://www.indymedia.org. 
This site is dedicated to alternative 
reporting on mainstream and alter-
native events and uses a vast, grass-
roots network of informants to 
bring breaking news direct to me, 
always with the proper qualifica-
tions as to exactly who verified 
what and when, and never with 
Dan Rather cracking wise about 
motor homes. 

The UCSD Guardian last year 
has, in my opinion, made such an 
error. The assembled sages of the 
Guardian editorial staff last year 
panned our current A.S. Cpmmis-
sioner of Media, Rami Sharaawy, 
when he ran for the office he now 
holds by refusing to endorse him. 

Talk about electoral turn-
arounds. Shaarawy, one of several 
A.S. commissioners cute enough 
to be cast on a WB sitcom, holds 

the role within the A.S Council 
traditionally held by status quo 
hatchet men . Most of his prede-
cessors were used by the agminis-
tration, some times knowingly. 
sometimes not, to slash funds and 
support for various publications 
such as Voz Fronteriza, the New 
Indicator and the California Review. 

You have never heard of these 
publications? That is because 
their existence has been almost 
obliterated over the years, leaving 
us with only two prominent stu-
dent-funded and stud ent-run 
publications: the Koala and the 
Muir Quarterry. These two van-
guards of drunken hilari ty certain-
ly make for good reading on the 
crapper, and make for better toi let 
paper than the Center Hall onc-
ply, but do little else to enhance 
our student lives. 

Just because you 're handed 
issues while twiddling your 
th urnbs in the Price Center does 
not mean that they're free. You , 
me and every other student paid 
for them, at somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $20 apiece. This 
money is part of your student 
activity fees, and it goes to the 
A.S. Council, and then they give it 
out. 

In the case of alternative media, 
they used to give a lot more of it 
out, until along came one particu-
larly smarmy commissioner who 
slashed budgets every which way, 
but wisely. and then founded (wait 
for it) the Koala. 

Funny old world, innit?

Drinking: 
Alcohol brings out the 
worst in people

there, mentally at least. Not sur-
prisingly, they tend to be a more 
thoughtful , contemplative crowd, 
less inclined to act like morons and 
annoy somebody in the process. 

I can recall many times I've 
found my elf in a crowd of smo.k-
ers. I (emember the calmness of 
the mo d in the circle. The vibe 
was good . Sure, their frequent 
spitting and coughing got to me 
after a while, but that was a minor 
distraction. The point is that 
everyone was pretty real, which is 
more than I can say for Ulost peo-
ple who get wasted. We shared 
laughs and had a good time. 

I am not advocating smoking, 
you sec. Few would argu!! that it 
isn't a bad habit. I am simply say-
ing that compared to most obnox-
ious drinkers I have known in my 
day, smokers are a much more tol-
erable crowd. 

I feel it necessary to clarify my 
argument a bit, so as not t.o con-
fuse our I yal readers. When I say 
I find drinkers annoying, I am 
referring to a specific type of 
drinker. I'm not referring to the 
drinker who has a couple of drinks 
to unwind every now and then . 
That type tends to be mellow and 

cool, almost on par with the most 
bearable smokers. Instead, ['m 
talking about the kind who cannot 
hold their liquor and periodically 
end up vomiting chunks over a 
railing at the end of a party. 

What exactly makes these sorts 
of drinkers so very annoying? For 
starters, they have a tendency to get 
very loud. Losing all inhibitions is 
to be expected, but many take it to 
the extreme. Often, 

The ucsb Guardian 
incoherent and go<Jry drunks. 

Comedy, though, only goes so 
far. After a while, their wild ways 
are no longer as funny and soon 
become downright irritating. Par-
ticularly striking is when they are 
so smashed that they're whining 
about how bad they feel. Before 
you know it, they're hugging a toi-
let, wishing to God something 
would come up. 

That reminds 
sexual energy takes 
charge of a 
drinker's entire 
being, and before 
you know it, 
there's a greasy 
drunk hunched 
over your lap try-
ing to straddle you 
and lick your fore-
head. 

Drinking can 
provide the 
necessary fuel for a

ago. Alcohol was

mood was festive. 
I could barely

Drinking can 
be very fun, and [ 
realize this. Losing 
control isn't, how-
ever. Unfortunate-
ly, too many 
drinkers often do

fraught with fun 
and merriment.

didn 't mind the 
inebriated ones 
around me. No

them is chugging shot after shot of 
Bacardi 151 until they lose count. 

Maybe losing his mind occa-
sionally is fun for the person 
doing it, but it is rarely so for 
everyone else witnessing it. We 
laugh at drunken people because 
- let's face it - they're hilarious. 
Few things are as entertaining as . 

ed to I!njoy the 
ambiance of the party, however, 
than did their over-the-top behav-
ior start to really bug me. 

The drinkers started to get 
rowdy and idiotic. They became 
insincere up to the point where I 
wasn't sure if they were really that 
stupid or if it was just the alcohol 
talking. Comments were thrown 

IHI fifTH ANNUAL 

around, such as, "I am so wasted 
right now, let's see how many 
more shots 'til I pass out!" It was 
this sort of self-proclaiming, self-
aggrandizing behavior that I found 
particularly vexatious. It's about as 
annoying as a group of guys brag-
ging about who's got a bigger 
package or who's sfept with the 
most girls. 

Many drinkers become preten-
tious and feel the need to declare 
how cool they are by the number 
of shots they can down in one sit-
ting. Let's face it, some people are 
annoying enough sober. But if you 
give them a few drinks, forget it. 
They become unbearable. Smok-
ers smell and drinkers can be fake. 
Pick your complaint. As for 
myself, I have no trouble breathing 
a little smoke. 

The Roman philosopher 
Senl!ca once said, "Drunkenness 
is simply voluntary insanity." 
Show me one truly sane person, 
and I'll show you a completely 
honest world. From time to time, a 
little insanity is a marvelous thing. 
Drinking can provide the neces-
sary fuel for a perfectly mindless 
experience, one fraught with fun 
and merriment. Crossing the line 
by acting fake and brainless is 
when it becomes old. 

Some smokers may be fake, but 
at least it isn't the cigarette that's 
causing it. I've said it twice and ['II 
say it again: Drinkers are more 
annoying than smokers.

Smoking: 
There are a lot of adverse 
effects for smokers 
contI ..... ".... ..... 4 
changes, both mental and physical, 
are not just temporary. 

[ remember one guy on my high 
school track team. He was a decent 
400-meter runner as a freshman, 
but over the summer he started 
smoking weed. Next season, he 
just could not figure out why he-
was so slow all of a sudden. 

Then there are those who con-
tend that since marijuana is nat-
ural, it cannot be bad for you. 
Right. Would you like a side of all-
natural poisonous mushrooms to 
go wi th tha t? 

What really cracks me up is 
when people tell me marijuana can 
be used for medicinal purposes, so 
it must be healthy. Wrong again . 
This "medicinal purpose" is no dif-
ferent than that served by mor-
phine: it acts as a pain killer when 
a person is afflicted with a terminal 
disease. It does not aid in recovery, 
nor does it prolong life. If you want 
to argue that marijuana is good for 
you, you may as well include LSD 
and heroin in your argument. 

[f you get completely smashed 
one night, the alcohol is totally out 
of your system by the next morn-
ing. But that one joint you smoke 
will still be in your system for the 
next month or so. 

First of all, by no means am I a 
science major; [ have enough trou-
ble getting through chem 11. But [ 
do know that marijuana screws 
with parts of your anatomy that 
should not be screwed with, and, if 
the substance builds up in your 
system, the results cannot be good. 

And besides, joints are even 
more annoying than cigarettes. 
Whenever you go to a big concert, 
it is almost impossible to come 
home without smelling like pot, 
which was always rathÂ·er difficult to 
explain [0 my mom back when she 
did my laundry. 

So is smoking the first sign of 
the apocalypse? I wouldn't count 
on it. There are bigger problems 
out there, [ike theÂ· fact that the 
election of the leader of the free 
world may come down to people 
who are too stupid to vote for the 
candidate of their choice. 

[f you want to smoke, it is your 
choice. Just don't decide for the 
rest of us that we have to inhale it. 

[ will leave you with some pro-
found words on the topic from the 
ancient Chinese philosopher, Con-
fucius: 

"Do not walk in front of me, for 
[ may not follow. 

Do not walk behind me, for I 
may not lead. 

Don't walk beside me; just get 
the hell away:

Editor: 
I am responding to the article 

"Hille[ Seeks to Buy Vacant UCSD 
Lot." 

The circumstances surrounding 
the development ofthis city-owned 
space parcel (not a "UCSD lot") are 
far more complex than have been 
presented in your article. 

Media: 
Alternate magazines are -
em their W'!Y here 
....... ed rro.,... . 
calor, and The Disorientation manu-
al. Oh, and the Koala and Muir 

Residents of the La Jolla High-
lands neighborhood recognize and 
respect Hillel's desire to have its 
own facility to accommodate the 
social. religious, cultural and edu-
cational needs of its constituency. 
Opposition is based solely upon 
the proposed use of this site. 

This ite is zoned single-family 
residential (R-l) and has been desig-
nated "open space" or "Iandscaped 
park" in official planning documents 
over the past 25 years. Residents 
purchased their homl..s here with 
the expectations that zoning regula-
tions wo~ld be upheld: [n fact, there 
is a great deal of controversy con-
cerning the process by which this 
property is now suddenly avai[able 
for lease or sale, with priority given 
to nonprofit organizations. 

The Hillel organization pro-
poses to build a 10,000 square-
foot center on this site. The pro-
posed facility would accommo-
date hundreds of persons - not 
just UCSD students - for a vari-
ety of social activities and reli-
gious services, including'mea[ ser-
vice for 1 SO to 200 persons at a 
time, at [east weekly. The facility 
would be in use seven days a 
week, including evenings, week-
ends and holidays - suggesting a 
use more compatible within a 
commercial environment. 

The increased volume of pedes-
trian and vehicular traffic drawn 
into the neighborhood by partici-
pants accessing the facility would 

Quamrly still publish, too. 
[ could attempt a summary of 

these varied and va[uable projects, 
but it's better that they speak for 
themselves. If you are interested in 
these projects, or a similar one of 
your own, get in touch with 
Sharaawy by cruising to the third 
floor of the Price Center, where all 

significantly impact the quality of 
life of its residents due to addition-
al traffic congestion, parking prob-
lems, noise and safety issues. 

Similar Hillel facilities at UC 
Berkeley, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara 
and SOSU are not located in resi-
dential neighborhoods, but in 
densely populated student housing 
areas surrounded by fraternity 
houses, apartment buildings and 
commercial establishments. 

The proposed student center 
does not conform to zoning regula-
tions for this site and is not a com-
patible use within a single-family 
residential neighborhood. Further, 
institutional development of any 
kind on this site is not appropriate. 

There are several possible solu-
tions. First, Hillel could utilize 
existing facilities. Two synagogues 
are located in our neighborhood 
and withing walking distance of 
UCSD. The Jewish Community 
Center with its own Judaica library 
is also located neaer UCSD. 

Second, UCSD plans to 
increase student meeting space on 
campus - with the possibility of 
an ecumenical center for use by all 
student/religious groups. 

Third, other city-owned sites 
nearby may be avai[able. 

The full City Council will meet 
soon to discuss and vote up<,lI1 this 
issue.

~D & NATION 
Election Recount Battle Threatens 
Florida's Uneasy Political Truce 

BOCA RATON, Fla. - To 
understand the pragmatic culture 
of Florida politics - and how it is 
being threatened as never before 
by this extra-innings presidential 
election - it is useful to consider 
the example of Dempsey Barron, a 
man of humble Panhandle roots 
who emerged as one of the state's 
most powerful politicians in the 
1970s and 1980s. 

In 1974, at a time when 
Republicans were a distinct 
minority in Florida, Barron 
became president of the Florida 
Senate, a position from which he 
controlled key committee 
appointmen ts. A life-long 
Democrat who had fought to 
desegregate Florida's public 
schools, Barron promptly 
appointed a Republican to chair 
an important subcommittee. 

"There's not enough talent 
around to waste it; he said then. 

His example set a tone that has 
endured for decades. Despite 
sharp differences on many impor-
tant issues, Democrats and 
Republicans here more often than 
not have found ways to work 
together. There have been knock-
down fights for sure. especially in 
recent years as Republicans have 
solidified their control of the state 
house, but again and again con-
servative Democrats have struck 
pragmatic alliances with mode.rate 
Republicans to defeat those on 
the edges of the political spec-
trum. 

In the last 12 days, this get-
along, go-along tradition has been 
sorely tested, residents and politi-
cal leaders said in recent inter-
views this weekend. Florida's 
sprawling ballot fight - with all 
its bickering and name-calling 
and humiliating revelations of 
Election Day incompetence by 

officials from both parties - has 
put enormous strain on bipartisan 
relationships, leaving deep scars 
that may have long-term implica-
tions for the future of this state. 

"A lot of bridges are being 
burned; said Lance deHaven-
Smith, a political scientist at 
Florida State University in 
Tallahassee. "Anything that any-
one says, it's all being written 
down in the book of vendettas." 

Barron, who switched to the 
Republican party in the late 
1980s, was too ill to speak Sunday. 
But his wife, Terri Jo, said that 
were he well enough, he surely 
would be reaching out to his 
friends in both parties. 

"It's just so heartbreaking; she 
said from the couple's 2,OOO-acre 
ranch in North Florida.

Clinton Ends Emotional Trip to Vietnam, 
Encourages Economic Cooperation 

HO CHI MINH CITY, 
Vietnam - President Clinton 
ended an emotionalthrt:e-day visit 
to Vietnam on Sunday as he began 
it, pressing America's former foe 
- gently but insistently - to set 
aside its fears and join the global 
marketplace of trade and ideas. 

"Imagine how much more you 
will achieve as even more young 
people gain more freedom to 
shape the decisions that affect 
their lives," he said. The key to the 
future, he repeated, is "entrepre-
neurship, innovation and compe-
tition" as well as "an open 
exchange of ideas." 

Here, as in Hanoi where his 
visit started, Clinton was sur-
rounded by throngs of excited 
onlookers. Sunday they were resi-
dents of the former Saigon, many 
of whom had fought alongside 
Americans against the victorious 
Communist north 25 years ago. 

During his visit , he met with 
Vietnam's leaders, addressed the 
nation on te levision, honored 
America's missing soldiers and 
met with business leaders and 
young people. But the most strik-
ing element of his visit was the 
fervor of the crowds on the 
streets. 
. "I love him!" cried Tran Thi 

Thu Huong, 31, a saleswoman, 

who waited like thousands of 
other people Sunday for a glimpsl' 
of the American president. "He is 
so handsome." . 

It may have been this sponta-

CNnton risked the further 
irritation of his hosts 
Sunday when he 
demonstrated America's 
concern over religious 
freedom with a brief, 
unannounced visit to 
Pham Minh Man, the 
city's Roman Catholic 
archbishop. 
neous enthusiasm - something 
almost unheard-of here - that 
prompted the country's leader, Le 
Kha Phieu, the Communist Party:s 
general secretary, to issue a 
reminder that Vietnam had fought 
and sacrificed for its independence. 

"Where did the cause of our 
resistance war against invaders 
come from?" he said in remarks 
published Sunday. 
"Fundamentally it came because 
imperialists invaded to get 

colonies. Why did the United 
States bring its army to invade 
Vietnam when Vietnam did not 
bring an army to invade the 
United States?" 

The dueling statements of the 
two leaders amounted to a public 
debate over the future here. It 
came four months after the two 
nations signed a trade agreement 
that, if carried out, will break 
down many of the protective walls 
Vietnam has erected around its 
economy and society. 

The agreement, Clinton said, 
"will help to develop a more open, 
sophisticated free market, based 
on international rules of law." 
And, he said, "The changes it will 
bring should be embraced, not 
feared ." 

Clinton risked the further irri-
tation of his hosts Sunday when 
he demonstrated America's con-
cern over religious freedom with a 
brief, unannounced visit to Pham 
Minh Man, the city's Roman 
Catholic archbishop. About 10 
percent of the population is 
Catholic and while religious wor-
ship is permitted, churches of all 
faiths must submit to government 
regulation .

The privacy rules, the first com-

health care in the United States. 

The new Congress could alter

culty mustering a consensus for

federal privacy standards died this 
year because of profound disagree-

Under the new rules, con-
sumers will for the first time have a 
federa l right to inspect and copy 
information in their medical 
records. They will also have the 
right to request correction of infor-

The nationalist parties

mean. What is clear is that interna-
tional officials are disappointed and 
the country is not set for major 
change. 

The nationalist parties have 
remained strong, but moderates 
may have enough votes to form 
governments in the two entities 
that make up Bosnia, the Muslim-
Croat Federation and the Bosnian 
Serb Republic. 

The results are mixed and 
promise a future of power sharing 
and haggling that spell further inef-
fectual government and continued 
obstruction from nationalists of 
efforts at unifying the country, ana-
lysts said. 

"Had there been a clear man-
date in favor of the moderates, you 
could have hoped things would 
move faster; said Michael Balagus, 
director of the t-lational 
Democratic Institute's program in 
Bosnia."lt's going to be slow, and

On Sunday, with 97 percent of 

organizations and other health care 
providers, including doctors, nurs-
es, hospitals, nursing homes, phar-
macies and medical laboratories. 

Federal officials said they had 
recently decided to back away from 
a proposal to give patients the right 
to sue in state court for violation of 
contract if their medical records 
were improperly disclosed. 

The Health Insurance 
Association of America said the 
proposal could have led to "exces-
sive litigation, including class 
action lawsuits, that would drive up 
health care costs." 

Paul G. Sherwood, senior vice 
president of Halifax Regional 
Medical Center, a 206-bed hospital 
in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., said it 
was unrealistic to hold him respon-
sible for what his business partners 
might do. 

"I have very little control over 
my contractors; Sherwood said. 
"The proposed rule appeared to be 
inviting a plethora of litigation." 

Doctors, hospitals and their 
partners will still have to comply 
with the rules, officials said, but 
patients will not get any new right 
to sue.

the vote counted, the nationalist 
Serbian Democratic Party 
emerged the strongest party in all 
of the elections in the Bosnian 
Serb Republic - for the presiden-
cy aDd in the legislatures of the 
republic and of Bosnia -
although moderates retain con-
siderable power in the Bosnian 
Serb Parliament. 

In the Muslim-Croat Pedera-
tion the picture was more splin-
tered, with the multiethnic Social 
Democratic Party gaining 27 per-
cent of, votes, roughly equal to the 
Muslim nationalist party, the Party 
for Democratic Action, and ahead 
of the Croatian Democratic 
Union, which dominated the 
Bosnian Croat community and 
won 19 percent of the federation 's 
overall vote. 

Petritsch said the fear and 
threats that had marked nationalist 
politics here since the old Yugoslav 
federation began to break apart 
would further isolate Bosnia as 
neighboring Yugo'slavia and 
Croatia were abandoning such 
policies. 

"Yugoslavia is on the way to 
becoming a democratic, European, 
integrated country," he said. "I do 
not want Bosnia to fall behind."

Executives Try to Determine Direction of Digital Music's FUture 
LOS ANGELES - You would 

think that the recent peace offer-
ings in the war between online 
music upstarts and the recording 
industry would have music lovers 
breaking into song. Not only did 
the Universal Music Group settle 
its copyright infringement lawsuit 
against MP3.com last week for a 
cool $53 .4 million , but th e 
German media giant Bertels-
mann brokered a truce with 
Napster the week before, presum-
ably opening the door for the 
other four major recording com-
panies to do the same. 

But do not expect to hear "Ode 
to Joy" just yet. Even as the ink is 
drying on the Universal agreement 
and Bertelsmann executives are 
swapping hugs with their new best 
friend, Napster's founder, Shawn 

Fanning, many executives in the 
online music world remain wary of 
the recording establishment. 

Gerry Kearby, co-founder of 
Liquid Audio, an Internet music 
and software company, told a 
crowd at a music industry confer-
ence here last week that, with cer-
tain exceptions, there is "no ratio-
nal thought on the record indus-
try's side of actually helping peo-
ple create businesses." 

Still, with the major recording 
companies having delivered little 
yet to satisfy users - and some of 
them red-faced that Bertelsmann 
ha stolen the spotlight - it is 
al most certain that industry can 
dawdle no more. 

For even if the German media 
titan fails, as Andreas Schmidt, the 
Bertelsmann executive who negoti-

"There is no rational 
thought on the record 
industry's side of actually 
helping people create 
businesses, " 

-8errJ"-br 
Co-Founder of liquid Audio 

ated the deal, concedes could hap-
pen, the industry has witnessed the 
first signs of its own Berlin Wall 
being dismantled, a powerful sym-
bol that the Cold War between the 
recording companies and Internet 
renegades is thawing. 

The question now is, in which 
digital direction - or directions 
- will the recording industry 

move? 
For years, the five major record-

ing companies have made a lot of 
noise about distributing music 
online - worrying about the 
potential fo :' piracy or arguing 
among themselves about the best 
technology for selling music as 
downloadable software files. Nearly 
two years ago, the industry even 
formed a consortium that vowed to 
have such technology ready in time 
for Christmas - last Christmas. 
And it still has not happened. 

So far, their detractors say, 
what the big music companies 
have mainly managed to do best is 
keep their critics, competitors and 
consumers at arm 's length -
defending their turf in highly 
publicized courtroom battles or 
making digital downloads so 

expensive and cumbersome that 
customers have sh unned them. 

But the poi nt now, for 
Schmidt, is that recording compa-
nies have few options but to come 
up with an attractive format that 
offers music buyers more freedom 
and choice online. 

Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist 
at Acce1 Partners in Palo Alto, 
Calif., considers the Bertelsmann-
Napster agreement seminal. 

"There are few an noun ce-
ments that I view as concrete evi-
dence that the Internet has 
changed an industry; he said. 
"This is one. And you can bet 
everyone is scrambling to get 
together a strategy."

Collegiate: 
Affirmative action was 
last in pLace in 1997 
Contll ..... frOlll PICe 1 

"You guys are here for a good 
cause and you should never give 
up that cause," Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante told the chanting 
crowd that wound around Covel's 
s ta i rca ses. 

Student Regent Justin Fong also 
appeared before the students, and 
yelled, "Whose university? " to 
which the crowd replied, Â· Our uni-
versity!" 

The rally was organize~ by the 
Affirmative Action Coalition , 
which is comprised of such student 
groups as the African Student 
Union, Asian Pacific Coalition and 
MECM. It was the coalition that 
organized the 1998 takeover of 
Royce Hall in protest of 
Proposition 209, the California 
ballot initiative regarding bilingual 
education which voters passed in 
1996. 

The coalition is not affiliated 
with the UC Berkeley group By 
Any ~ea_ns Necessary, which gath-
ered a' smaller crowd to protest the 
ban on affirmative action 
Wednesday. 

Sincl: the 1998 implementa-
tion of SP-l, SP-2 and 
Proposition 209, the university 
has witnessed a drop in enroll-
ment by under-represented 
minority siudents. 

In 199/ , the last year affirma-
tive action was in place, 221 
African Americans and 572 
Chicano and Latino students 
enrolled at UCLA. Those num-
bers Â· dropped to 157 and 525> 
respectively this fall , even though 
total undergraduate enrollment 
has increased.

More International 
Students Study 
In U.S., Report Say. 

MINNEAPOLIS - According 
to an annual report by the Institute 
of International Education, there 
has been a steep increase in the 
number of students participating 
in international studies at universi-
ties across the nation. 

The report, Opendoors 2000, 
stated the foreign student popula-
tion in the United States is now 
514,723, a 4.8 percent increase 
from last year. The report also 
revealed that the University of 
Minnesota has one of the largest 
international student populations. 

According to the study, 3,061 
students from other countries 
attended U of M during the 1999-
2000 school year. 

When compared to all other 
research universities, U of M 
ranked 16th in number of enrolled 
international students. New York 
University was first on the list, with 
4,890 foreign students. 

Although the report did not 
address the number of students 
studying abroad, university officials 
said that number is growing as 
well. 
â€¢ "We're really happy to see this,w 
said Kay T homas, director of 
International Student and Scholar 
Services. She said that U of M is an 
attractive institution for foreign 
students. "We have good programs 
and services; she said. 

According to Thomas, 966 new 
international students joined the 
university this fall, approximately 
16 percent higher than the 806 
new students who joined the year 
before. 

People from other countries are 
realizing that an international edu-
cation is important but, she said, U 
of M has not done enough to 
recruit overseas undergraduates.

University officials have been 
increasing their efforts to attract 
students from other countries in 
hopes of raising the number of 
international students at the uni-
versity even more.

The Relationship 
Divide: Women Expect 
More from Men 

DAVIS - For years, relation-
ship researchers have been striving 
to understand why some couples 
become everlasting success stories 
while others deteriorate into hor-
ror tales. 

A study by UC Davis psycholo-
gist Richard Robins suggests at 
least part of the answer: men and 
women look for different things in 
their mates, so the personalities of 
both partners can predi<;t whether 
their expectations will match up 
and ultimately how successful the 
relationship will be. 

Robins' findings, published in a 
recent Journal of Personality and 
Social Psychology, show that a 
man's satisfaction with a relation-
ship can be predicted by whether 
his partner tends to be critical and 
anxious, whereas a woman's happi-
ness is influenced by a range of 
emotional traits displayed by her 
boyfriend or husband. 

The study, funded largely by the 
National Institute of Mental 
Health, examined 360 couples in 
established relationships to see 
how each partner's character 
shaped the quality of their relation-
ship. 

Robins looked at three broad 
personality traits: negative emo-
tionality, positive emotionality and 
constraint. Individuals who scored 
high in the first category easily 
exhibit emotions such as fear, anx-
iety and anger.

MANY STUDENTS ARE TURNING 

TO CAFFEINE TO KEEP THEM 
AWAKE AND ALERT WHEN 

DROWSINESS BEGINS TO SET IN 

hen Muir senior 
Roshani Patel 
wakes up every 
morning, she 
makes herself a cup 

of coffee before heading to cam-
pus. Patel, like millions of other 
people, has grown accustomed to 
daily caffeine consumption. Cof-
fee, soda and caffeine pills have 
become increasingly . popular 
among students, helping them to 
Â·stayalen. 

According to the Internation-
al Food Information Council, 
Qlffeine, which is part of a group 
of compounds known as 
methylxanthines, is a substance 
that is found in the leaves, seeds 
and fruits of at least 63 plant 
species throughout the world. 
Common sources of caffeine 
include coffee, cocoa beans, kola 
nuts and tea leaves. Depending 
on the amount consumed, caf-
feine can act as a mild stimulant 
to the central nervous system. 

According to the AmeriQln 
Medical Association, over 80 
percent of adults in the United 
States consume some form of 
caffeine. The AMA study also 
states that each day, the average 
adult ingests approximately 280 
milligrams of caffeine, the 
amount found in about two large 

cups of coffee. 
This "coffee craze" is com-

mon among people of all ages, 
and Patel is no exception. 

Â·On average, 1 drink about 
five to six cups of coffee per day; 
Patel said. "The caffeine helps 
me to wake up in the morning, 
and allows me to function 
throughout the day without get-
ting tired." 

While overall consumption of 
caffeinated beverages has 
increased over the years, studies 
have shown that the drug, if 
taken in small amounts, is not 
harmful. 

Roland Griffiths of Johns 
Hopkins School of Medicine 
confirmed that relatively small 
doses of caffeine might have pos-
itive effects. 

Â·People who take in small . 
amounts of caffeine say that they 
feel more awake and alen: Grif-
fiths said. "In higher doses, how-
ever, Qlffeine can produce nega-
tive effects, such as anxiety and 
nervousness. " 

So, how much Qlffeine is too 
much? 

The Food and DrugAdminis-
tration suggests that people who 
consume farge amounts of coffee

The Editor's Soapbox 
E-mails are leading to the degredation of language skills 
among people in modern society 
By JEFFREY WHm 
Copy Editor 

There is an old saying that 
goes something like this: "A soci-
ety can be judged on the basis of 
how it treats its prisoners." I hap-
pen to think this is true in many 
respects. 

However, since I have been at 
college I have come to my own 
alternate conclusion regarding 
cri\eria for judging our society: e-
mail. 

Before I go on, I feel it is only 
fair that I mention that I am a 
copy editor here at the Guardian, 
and in the media world, copy edi-
tors are notorious for being nit-
picking, unreasonably anal gram-
marmongers. That being said, I 
shall now continue. 

I am now in my fourth year at 
UCS D, and I began using e-mail 
on a regular basis my first year 
here. Since then, I have become 
thoroughly disgusted with what I 
encounter each time I wearily sit 
down at my computer and reluc-
tantly check my Microsoft Out-
look i.nbox. 

Now, I'm not one to brag, but I 
usua lly have somewhere in the 
range of 10 to 15 e-mails waiting 
for me when I check at the end of 
the day. Aside from the junk mail , 
there are invariably two or three 
messages that just make me 
cringe. 

For some reason, many young 
people seem to think that the 
rules of the English language 
don't apply when it comes to 
electronic mail. I say "young 
people," because when I get mes-
sages from my parents or older 
relatives, they are usually com-
posed of co mplete sentences, 
paragraphs, and even some capi-
tal letters appropriately placed 
here and there. 

I think I know a couple of 
people who have yet to touch the 
shift button on their keyboard 
while writing me an e-mail. 

UCSD is supposed to have 
pretty sharp individuals studying 
here, but I have gotten some e-
mail "messages" from these peo-
ple that should constitute basis 
for their demotion back to first 
grade. 

The next time I get an e-mail 
along the lines of "yo bring that cd 

r 
p.-.-'~." .. I . 

~ 
Before the Internet, when 
people actually sent 
letters to each other 
through the mail, I doubt 
they drew little emoticons 
after every sentence. 
They actually took some 
time to make sure their 
letter was worth reading. 
tomorrow you know the won i 
lent you this wknd alrite then 
thame ;-D." I'm going to lose it. 

There is one notable exception 
to my wrath: the drunken e-mail. I 
actually think those are pretty 
funny. 

I know what you're thinking, 
but I am not a total freak. I am just 
special and unique - at least 
that's what my mom told me. I 
don 't have any problems with the 
occasional typo in a quickly writ-
ten e-mail. I don't even really have 
a problem with the fact that not 
everyone knows the difference 
between "accept" and "except." 
These can get a little tricky in the 
middle of the night, which is 
when a good amount of the e-mail 
I get is created. 

What I do have a problem 
with is "emoticons: Emoticons 
are those short strings of punc-
tuation made to look like faces. 
Every time I see one of those lit-
tle pieces of crap, I get the gag 
reflex. 

First of all, every lame punctu-
ation face I have ever seen has to 
be looked at sideways. Second, 
they are so disgustingly cutesy, 
their use should be reserved for 
schoolgirls of junior-high age and 
younger. 

If you cannot express your 
thoughts and emotions in a typed 
message without resorting to 
gross punctuation misuse, you 
have some serious problems. 

I also take issue with "LOL; 
which apparently signifies "laugh-
ing out loud." If you actually had 
to type that, it probably wasn't 
that funny. 

Also ... I don't think any form 
of writing abuses the elipsis mark 
more than the e-mail. 

Now, I do realize that a lot of 
these bad e-mail habits come 
from using programs such as 
Instant Messenger and ICQ. 
Actually, besides their negative 
impact on e-mail style and social 
lives, I have no problem with these 
programs. 

Because of the instantaneous 
nature of this type of chatting, it is 
fine to try to go as fast as you can, 
and if you're a slow typist, using 
things like "LOL" and emoticons 
can help you get your point across 
quickly. 

However, this is not the 
nature of e-mail. E-mail to me is 
exactly like a letter,just sent elec-
tronically as opposed to via U.S. 
postal services. It is almost as if 
"e-mail" is short for "electronic 
mail." 

Before the Internet, when peo-
ple actually sent letters to each 
other through the mail, I doubt 
they drew little emoticons after 
every sentence, They actually took 
some time to make sure their let-
ters were worth reading. 

What I think many students 
don~ understand is that their e-
mails actually reflect on them. I 
can say that I have better impres-
sions of people who send me well-
written messages. 

I know not everyone judges 
others on' the basis of their 
grammar skills like I do, but I'm 
sure most people, if only subcon-
sciously, actually do consider 
horrible e-mailers with less 
esteem. 

It is hard, at least for me, to 
take someone seriously who sends 
me sideways, buck-toothed, wink-
ing smiley faces. I seriously doubt 
they were actually making those 
faces while they were writing. 

Then again, I'm also against 
those "Visualize Whirled Peas" 
bumper stickers.

ArIes (M.arcl! 21-AprIl19) 
The workload is heavy on Mon-

day, but the party flag is flying by 
Thesday. Your luck has just changed 
for the better, which should be obvi-
ous on Wednesday. Don't get too 
rowdy that night, however. The 
headache you'd have on Thursday 
morning would be just awful. Watch 
for bargains and profitable opportu-
nities late Thursday and Friday. 
Travel is forecast for this weekend. 
The only problem on Saturday is 
that you can't take everybody with 
you. Your reaction to an unexpected 
event on Sunday lets you know 
you're on the right path. 

T .... (April roMay 20) 
Get your lovin' in early on 

Monday. The work pace picks up, 
and on Tuesday you'll be racing at 
full speed with all the other rats. 
Avoid an attractive distraction on 
Wednesday. If you don't watch 

I where you're going, you could run 
into something. Avoid a person 
who's Â·all talk and no action on 
Thursday, to save valuable time. Be 
flexible on Friday; it's likely there'll 
be a change in your plans, The urge 
to splurge will be hard to fight this 
weekend. Get a high-quality item 
after which you've long lusted, and 
your buyer's remorse shou ld be 
minimal. 

GeIIIInl (May 21-June 21) 
Detailed work flows on Mon-

day, so push yourself to get it all 
done. There's a mess-up regarding 
a romantic appointment mid-Thes-
day, but you're In for a pleasant 
surprise later that evening. That 
would also be a good time for you 
to pop the question, if you have 
one to ask. Circumstances beyond 
your control could interfere with 
your love life on Wednesday. Just 
save up your money, and you'll get 
a chance to spend it on Thursday. 
Collaborate closely with a co-
worker Friday, and a difficult 
assignment will be fun . Do what 
your partner suggests on Saturday. 
That's the partner you can trust 
completely, of course. Visiting 
friends together on Sunday should 
prove interesting. You might even 
want to take notes. 

Monday, November 20, 2000 

c.cer (June 22-July 22) 
Remember to do the errands 

you promised on Monday, and 
you'll be nicely rewarded. You'd 
like to sleep in on Tuesday, but 
your partner and/or your boss 
have other plans. Something 
needs to be done at home on 
Tuesday and Wed nesday. If you 
don 't already know what it is, your 
roommate will be glad to tell you. 
By Thursday you're ready for an 
outing, but it may be late before 
you can get away. It'll be easier to 
get your chores Clone Friday, and 
then you can make a break for it. 
On Saturday the other person has 
the first serve, so take care. The 
more you aim to please on Sun-
day, the more likely you'll win the 
game, 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Shop for bargains on house-

hold items as much as you can on 
Monday. You might find the perfect 
thing at a great price on your lunch 
hour. If quality and style are more 
important to you than price, you 
can wait until Tuesday, If you and 
your mate can't agree on Wednes-
day, stall. Odds are good you'll find 
an alternative on Thursday that 
neither of you had considered. 
Don't get depressed if a scheme 
you try Friday simply doesn 't work. 
It's more complicated than that, so 
do more research and studying 
over the weekend. Save plenty of 
time for fun and games, too. Your 
favorite playmate has a few surpris-
es in store for you. 

v.,.. (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
You're apt to be the one who 

finds the answer on Monday. Keep 
digging, your chances are better 
than anyone else's. Financial 
rewards could be yours on Thesday 
or Wednesday. The money's a 
result of your willingness to get rid 
of something that's cluttering up 
your private space. Something you 
find on Thursday could change the 
way you do your work. It might 
even change where you work, if 
necessary. Frustrations on Friday 
could have you checking the want 
ads. Don't leave one paycheck 
before you have another one lined 
up. If you're thinking of relocating, 
this weekend will be perfect. Or, 
just have a party at your place. 
Looks like there's lots of chaos 
there anyway - might as well 
enjoy it. 
UIInI (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 

You could be faced with a load I)f 
overdue chores on Monday. Don't 
panic. just take them one at a time. 
Put them in order of importance. 
Your energy level's high through 
Tuesday and Wednesday, and you're 
getti,!g smarter. You'll find that a 
task that was daunting before is

regular basis often find that their 
bodies have adapted to the con-

increasing their tolerance to the

order to create a stimulating

Those who

percentage of this figure includes 
those who are between the ages 
of 18 "nd 24. Although caffeinat-
ed drinks are popular among I 
people of all ages, college stu-
dents have been shown to rely on 
stimulants such as caffeine pills 
in order to increase their alert-
ness. 

One such pill is Vivarin, a 
FDA-approved, over-the-counter

physical and psy-

to irritabHity.

consumption of 
caffeinated beverages

studies have 
determined that 
students tend to 
use caffeine pills

been known to 
use these stimu-

Griffiths warns that the sub-

lead to mild side effects. He refers 
to caffeine as the world's most 
widely used "mil1(~-altering drug." 

Patel has experienced some of 
the side effects of caffeine con-

"I have been drinking coffee 
since I was 14 years old, and over 
the years I have increased the 
amount of caffeine that I am able 
to consume; she said. "I am so 
used to having a certain amount 
of caffeine each day that if I go

Regular caffeine consumers

"Sometimes the caffeine in 
coffee and soda does not keep me

such as Vivarin often succeed in 
making me more alert, even when

College students contribute a

starting to become almost easy. 
Don't get cocky, though. Thursday 
and Friday are fraught with peril. 
You may even be too tired to go out 
on Friday night. Schedule your 
romantic interlude for Saturday 
instead. Choose a date who's stim-
ulating intellectually as well as oth-

write home about. 

Scorpio (Oct. 24Â·Nov. 21) 
A friend can help you make an 

important connection on Mon-
day. Go ahead and ask for the 
favor. Knowing which button to 
push helps you find the resources 
you need on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Pushing them' takes 
tact, and perfect timing, both of 
which you have in abundance. A 
mess at home could throw you off 
stride on Thursday - temporari-
ly. Stay alert; you'll get another 
opportunity to score. Things are 
not as they appear to be on Friday. 
Don't say much, you could find 
out later that you were talking to 
the wrong person . Saturday'S 
good for losing a wager, or spend-
ing too much at the stores. Ixnay 
on gambling, too. Sunday'S better 

for fixing up your place, but don't

Don't snap back at a critical 
older person on Monday. If you 
simply say, "Yes, SIR!" or ma'am, 
whichever the case may be, you'll 
increase your profits instead of 
losing your job. Tell the whole 
stoty to your friends on Tuesday, 
and they'll give you lots of sympa-
thy. Don 't let them solve your 
problem for you on Wednesday, 
though. That would be too expen-
sive. Let them inspire you, and 
maybe teach you how to do it 
yourself on Thursday. Keep a low 
profile on Friday. Listen instead of 
telling what you know, and you' ll 
discover an error before you make 
it. The ba ll 's in your court over the 
weekend. Partying with neighbors 
and siblings would be perfect. 
Don't spread gossip you've recent-
ly heard, ho~ever. Check it out 
carefully by asking a friend who 
would know on Sunday.

Monday if you want to try some-

your income, though, so don 't 
worry about it. 

Aqu.nu. (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 
If you have all the facts and fig-

ures, you could benefit quite nice-
lyon Monday. Don't leave any-
thing to chance. Travel's appealing 
on Tuesday and Wednesday, but 
not a good idea. Take care of 
obligations instead. You're likely 
to clash with an older person 
Wednesday night or Thursday. 
This person is saying your dreams 
are unrealistic. Don't let that stop 
you. Dreams don't have tooe real-
istic anyway. Don't hurt yourself 
by trying to push a square peg into 
a round hole on Friday. You 'd be 
wise to play with a team, or bet on 
one, over the weekend. PI_. (Feb. 19-March 20) 

Your partner's got all the angles 
figured out on Monday, so just go 
along with the program. A long-
distance contact on Tuesday could 
lead to a better job if you're inter-
ested. If money's tight on Tuesday, 
maybe it's time to go looking. 
Don't tell any work-related secrets 
on Wednesday, especially about 

the boss. He or she is apt to find 
out on Thursday or Friday, and 
would not be amused. Your prior-
ities are constantly shifting this 
weekend, so stay flexible. An older 
personÂ· wants to take control, but 
may nm have the route figured Out 
quite yet. Give hel pful hints. 

Blrthdeys 111 .. Weele: 
Nov. 20: Priorities are chang-

ing. You're growing from playing 
in the present to planning for the 
future. 

Nov. 21: Join friends in spiritu-
al inquiry and find the balance 
you've so ught. You 'll become 
more outspoken in the process. 

Nov. 22: Choose your friends 
carefully this year. They could lead 
you to great knowledge or into 
debt! 

Nov. 23: Old beliefs are chal-
lenged this yea r. Your studies lead 
to a deeper understanding and a 
stronger faith. 

Nov. 24: Can your dreams 
become reality? How about your 
fears? Through self-discipline, 
you'll be the architect. 

Nov. 25: You 're awesome this 
year, but don 't get cocky. Play by 
the rules, and the world will bene-
fit from your wisdom. 

Nov. 26: You're growing so fast 
your friends hardly recognize you. 
You were already cheerful and 
lucky. Now you're becoming prac-
tical, too.

Caffeine: 
Pills are being used 
to keep students awake 
C~lHIed from ,... 13 
most of its marketing plans toward 
young adults, since the market for 
the pills includes mostly college-
age people. 

Like Patel, Revelle junior Tan-
mai Saxena has used the Vivarin 
pill several times in order to 
increase his alertness. 

uThe amount of caffeine in a 
Vivarin pill is equivalent to about 
two cups of coffee," Saxena said . "I 
have taken Vivarin several times in 
the past in order to maximize my 
efficiency in terms of being able to 
stay up late to study: 

In 1997, The Center for Science 
in the Publ ic I nterest successfully 
urged the FDA to encourage man-
ufacturers of soft drinks, as we ll as 
other products containing caffeine, 
to properly label their products. 

I The CSPI claimed that consumers 
have a right to know the amount of 
caffeine in the products they pur-
chase. 

Recently, a number of studies 
on the potential dangers of 
increased caffeine use have been 
conuucted. In 1999, Consumer 
Reports on Health conducted a 
study of these dangers. 

The study found that an unusu-
al dose of caffeine can raise blood 
pressure levels temporarily, and if 
occurring during stressful periods, 
can be dangerous to people with 
hypertension. The study also con-
cluded that those who experience 
irregu lar heartbeats should elimi-
nate caffeine from their diets. Also, 
those who suffer from anxiety 
problems should avoid caffeine use 
since large doses of the substance 
can trigger panic attacks. Finally, it 
was concluded that insomnia and 
emotional distress were effects of 
long-term use of the drug. 

Despite the apparent side effects 
of . excess caffeine consumption, 
most students feel that the sub-
stance increases alertness and 
decreases drowsiness. Many claim 
that the increase in energy they 
experience is worth the few minor 
consequences of caffeine use. . 

Patel admits to her dependency 
on caffeine, but insists that if it 
were not for her daily cups of cof-
fee, she would bc unable to func-
tion with the same amount of ener-
gy. 

"Am I addicted? Of course," 
Patel said . "But old habits are hard 
to break."

18 SPORTS 

Soccer: 
Bronchos do not appear to be 
much of a challmge 
Continued from ...,. 20 

Kristin jones and Molly Carlson 
found the back of the net before the half 
ended to send UCSD into the break up 
3-1. 

The second half was more of the 
same. Cindy Dostalek booted a goal 
early in the second half, and Christy 
Abizaid added another off of a Alfredson 
pass. 

"I saw her in the corner with the ball, 
and 1 was kind offar back: Abizaid said. 
"Erika spotted it perfectly between twO 
players and I just did my job. Erika did a 
lot of work." 

Kristin Conahan added on the sixth 
goal for the Tritons. 

The Bronchos scored a second goal, 
but it was during garbage time and too 
little, too late. 

"A lot of it I think, was nerves: Cook 
said. "We're an extremely 'young team, 
only 3 years old. Our inexperience 
showed a little bit this game. They've got 
a good team and they came out strong. 
They caught us a little bit off guard. 
We're just an inexperienced team and we 
were here for the first time. I'm a little bit 
disappointed in that but chock it up to a 
good learning experience." 

The game was very physical, with 

The UCSD Gl:lardian 

bodies banging everywhere on the field . 
"We knew they were going to be 

physical: Alfredson said. "We were 
ready for it and luckily that didn't affect 
our ~ame too much." 

StX goals in a playoff game is uncom-
mon . It seems the Tritons are firing on 
all cylinders. 

"Right now we're all playing really 
well," Alfredson said. "Every single per-
son on the team - subs, starters, every-
one. Our level never drops. Hopefully we 
can continue that way." 

Alfredson finished with a goal and 
two assists. Dostalek had a pair of assists 
and goalkeeper Kami Poma made seven 
saves. 

"I think there's always room for 
improvement," Abizaid said. "That win 
was so amazing because we were ready 
to play. They were turning us a little too 
much. Those two goals could have been 
stopped. There is, of course, room for 
improvement, but how can you beat six 
goals?" 

UCSD will next face Franklin Pierce 
in the semifinals. Franklin Pierce is the 
defending Division 11 champion. 

The Final Four will take place Dec.1 
and Dec. 3, time and location to be 
announced. 

"We're just going to play like we know 
how to play." Abizaid said. "If we play our 
best, it's going to be really hard to beat us. 
We're just going to do what we always 
know how to do and see how far we can 
go with it. I think we can go far."

Bakersfield, notching 18 kills and 12 
digs in the win. Brooke jolley had a 
hand in the victory, contributing 15 
kills and 12 digs, as did Jessica Slay-
ton with 10 kills and 17 digs. 

The Tritons, despite the loss, 
should have few regrets about their 
first Division 1I season, as they put 
together an impressive inaugural 
record of 1 5-7 in conference play and 
21-20 overall. 

Laura Santerre led the team with 
346 kills for the season. 

jennie Wilson had more notches 
in the block category than any other 
Thton, compiling 104 over the dura-
tion of the season, and Leslie Pun-
nelli was the team's dig maestro, with â€¢ 
a whopping 397 on the season. 

These perform!lnces, as well as 
the team's overall season-long 
effort, should be applauded by all, 
as the team made the jump to Divi-
sion II with typical aplomb, and 
once there, established the UCSD 
women's volleyball team as a pow-
erhouse competitor and a force to 
be reckoned with in the coming 
years.

minutes into the second half 

Neither team was helped by the 
referees, who blew their whistles so 
frequently and enthusiastically tllat 
their faces started to turn blue due to 
lack of oxygen. 

Due to the frequency of the refs 
stopping the game, the teams were 
unable to establish a rhythm offen-
sively. All in all, they called a total of 
37 fouls and numerous traveling 
violations. 

"There were some questionable 
calls." Ruvald said .. "However ' we 
can't blame the game on the offi-
cials." she added. 

The crowd, which grew louder as 
the game progressed, also appeared 
to affect the young 1riton team . The 
UCSD women seemed to have trou-
ble at the free-throw line in the sec-
ond half, with the mucous Point 
Loma throng drowning out the few 
loyal UCSD fans. 

With the second half winding 
down, the Tritons' rawness was visi-
ble during one offensive series in 
which freshman Ali Ginn was passed 
the ball while she was attempting to 
tie her hair back, though no harm 
resuJted as she nonchalantly caught 
the ball and flipped it back with one 
hand. 

"We have a lot of young kids," 
Malone said. "We still have some 
growth to do." 

"I thought our young players 
really stepped up and kept their 
poise: Ruvald praised. 

With less than two minutes left 
in the game, Point Lorna pulled to 
within one when freshman Tammy 
McCoy scored on a break.1way to 
make the score 50-51. 

With 32 .7 seconds left and a 
one-point lead, Ruvald drew a foul 
and coolly sank both free throws 
to stretch UCSD's lead to three. 
However, in the next possession, 
Zimbelman ignited the Crusader 
crowd by burying a three-po in ter 
to tie the game with 23.2 seconds 
left. 

In the end, Zibelman's heroics 
were for naught, as Fok found her-
self wide open on the right wing and 
calmly stepped up and nailed the 
game winner. 

The UCSD women, seeking to 
improve upon last year's stellar 20-6 
record, will next square off against 
Christian Heritage on Thursday, 
Nov. 30.

Fok Brings UCSD Back From the Brink 
Last second shot by Triton leads team to thrilling victory over Point Lorna Nazarene 
â€¢ ISAAC PEAllLMAN 
Staff Writer 

Last Friday at the Golden Gym-
nasium in Point Loma, the 1liton 
women's basketball team outshined 
the Crusaders of Point Lorna 
Nazarene University with a thrilling 
last-second 58-56 victory. . 

The UCSD women capped off 
an exciting first game in NCAA 
Division II with a baseline jumper by 
junior Maya Fok with 0.8 seconds 
left. 

",The game] was a war." com-
mented head coach Judy Malone. "It 
was almost the same game as last 
year." 

With this victory, theÂ· Tritons 
added another chapter in their histo-
ry with Point Loma. UCSD has been 
closely matched against the Cru-
saders, including a 78-74 victory last 
year, until Friday's victory gave them 
the 4-3 edge in the overall series. 

The women's team began the 
game strong and cruised to a 35-24 
halftime lead, despite the height 
advantage the Crusaders possessed. 

"I think being as young as we are, 
we showed a lot of confidence and 
strength," said senior Genevieve 
Ruvald, the Tritons' leading scorer 
against Point Loma, with 17 points. 

The Tritons displayed their 
tenacity by battling for every 
rebot:nd and loose ball, which gave 
them a 32-22 shots-taken advantage 
in the first half. 

The second half was another 
story, however, as Point Lorna came 
out with all pistons firing. Corey 
Zimbelman, who led all scorers with 
18 points, opened the half with a 
three-pointer, and it was downhill 
for UCSD from there. 

After a few minutes of anemic 
offense, the Tritons called a timeout 
and proceeded to give the Crusaders 
an uncontested basket due to 
UCSD's tardiness in getting back 
onto the court after the timeout. 
However, the Tritons were kept in 
the game by their gritty defense and 
several big offensive plays, which 
included Ruvald scoring off a steal, 
Fok penetrating inside to get to the 
line, and a nice drive to the hoop by 
freshman Kimberly Hong. 

Despite its offensive efforts. Point 
Lorna crept to within 2 points eight

unquestionable mismatch

Bakersfield proves too much, beats UCSD in four games 
By seem IURROUGIII 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team knew it had its work cut out 
for it heading into the first round of 
the 2000 NCAA Division (( 
Women's Volleyball Pacific Region-
als. held at Cal State Los Angeles. 

The team had been mired in a 
rotten slump as the season slowly 
squeaked to a halt, dropping its 
final two regular season matches 
and looking uninspired on the 
floor. The two losses dropped the 
team from sole possession of sec-
ond place in its division to fourth-
behind Cal State Los Angeles, 
which finished in first, and Cal 
State San Bernardino and Cal State 
Bakersfield, which tied for second. 

. The Thtons were then given the 
sixth seed in the tournament and 
were slated to face their dreaded 
rival, Cal State Bakersfield, in their 
first-round game. The Bakersfield 
squad had taken home the first two 
meetings between the two teams in 
four sets apiece. so things were 
looking dark indeed for the Thton 
side. 

The team traveled to the tour-
nament site, the Eagles' Nest in Los 
Angeles. on Thursday night with 
hopes of changing the tide by 
breaking out of its late-season rut 

with a victory over Bakersfield and 
advancing to the next game. 

These hopes were dashed, how-
ever, by a pumped-up and impres-
sive Bakersfield performance. Cal 
State Bakersfield came out strong 
early, connivingly winning the first 
set 15-7 in front of the 400-person 
crowd at the Nest. 

The 1litons did fire back in the 
second set, showing a lot of heart 
and grit to overcome an early deficit 
and taking the set 15-13. It was all 
downhill from this point, though, 
as the Tritons would not win 
another set this night in November. 
In the end, they were ousted from 
the tournament after exhibiting 
feeble third and fourth-set perfor-
mances, and losing by scores of 15-
3 and 15-6, respectively 

The night was not without its 
highlights for the blue and gold, as 
many of its key players once again 

gave solid performances. The 
team's sole first-team AIl-CCM 
selection, Laura Santerre, once 
again excelled on the hardwood. 

She led the 1litons with 18 kills 
while picking up 9 digs. Leslie 
Pun nelli, a setond team AII-CCAA 
selection, along with teammate 
Christine Kueneman, had an 
impressive night defensively for 
UCSD, compiling a game-high 25 
digs while adding 9 kills. Kuene-
man also stood out with 17 digs. 
Jamie Woods stepped up with 15. 
jennie Wilson was another bright 
spot for the Thtons. with 15 kills 
and 7 digs. 

But these quality performances 
were just not enough to stop Cal 
State Bakersfield, which, led by 
Amy Wade's 22 kills and 22 digs, 
continuously kept the momentum

lot of young guys: said UCSD 
head coach Greg Lanthier. "The 
timing was a little off, and I think 
we shot a little quicker than we 
should have. We didn't shoot as 
well as we are capable of." 

In the last 10 minutes of the 
half, the Tritons missed 10 straight 
field goals before Swed assisted 
senior forward Sam Higgins, who 
sunk a three pointer with 2:22 left 
in the half. 

While UCSD was quiet in the 
field, SDSU made three turnovers, 
all by junior Randy Holcomb, and 
also made a few baskets. 

Higgins' score brought the 
score to a 33-18 Aztec lead, but 
SDSU added another lay-up less 
than two minutes before the 
buzzer, to etid the halfat 35-18. 

SDSU enjoyed a 48 percent 
field goal percentage in the first 
half, and it ended the game with 55 
percent overall . 

"I liked this game: Fisher said . 
"I was very happy to look. around 
and see a respectable crowd. I 
thought we played hard and 
defended efficiently." 

When asked why the season 
opener matched a Division I team 
with one of Division II, Fisher 
answered that all over the country 
this type of match up is occurring,

Diving Goes 
to USC 
Invitational 
8y TAIl MILLER 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD diving tcam made a 
sojourn to USC this weekend to 
compete in the three-day Trojan 
Diving Invitational. 

The invitational r~ n from 
ov.16 to Nov. 18 and showcased 

13 different teams. 
From California were UCLA, 

UC Irvine, UCSD, Redland s, San 
Diego St,1te, Fresno State, San Jose 
State, UC Berkeley and Stanford. 

From outside the state were Ari -
zona, BYU and Colorado Stare. 

The Tritons only had two people 
competing in the meet, Tare Van 
Arsdall and Emily Quon. Each com-
peted in the 1-meter springboard 
and faced stiff competition at this 
meet, as marry of the top divers in 
the nation were there. 

Diving in the meet were USC 
two-time All-American Kellie Bren-
nan, and Trojan standout freshmen 
Raymond Vincent and Nicci Fusaro. 

Additionally, UCSD was diving 
against Division I-level competition. 
Considering the fact that UCSD has 
only just moved up from Division 
III, this is a huge jump. 

UCSD's two divers competed 011 
the first day of the Invitational in the 
women's 1-meter springboard. 

Despite strong performances. 
neither one was able to advance 
past the preliminary rounds. 

Fusaro ended up taking the 1-
meter by a slim margin over Erin 
Sones of Stanford, 281.95 to 266.30. 

Omar Ojeda took the men's 3-
meter on the first day by demolish-
ing the rest of the field by over 100 
points. He finished with 609.90 
points to beat Justin Wilcock of 
BYU, whose final tally was 503 .95. 

Ojeda dominated not only the 
3-meter springboard but the rest of 
the Invitational as well. He took the 
1-meter on the second day of the 
competition by making the rest of 
the field look ridiculous, as not a 
single diver was within shouting 
distance of his 376.50 points. 

On the third day of competi-
tion, he did nOl win the lO-meter 
platform event but finished second 
to teammate Rubin Vaca. 

USC's Fusara also took the 3-
meter event. 

and the difference in rankings only 
serves to help both teams see what 
each needs to focus on . 

Lanthier agreed. "We were out-
matched phYSically, but this was 
the first time in a collegiate situa-
tion for a lot of our players. It 
shows them how things can be, and 
what needs work." 

Thirty seconds into the second 
half, SDSU scored a three pointer, 
which the Tritons answered with a 
trio of lay-ups, bringing the score 
to 43-24 SDSU. 

'The Aztecs almost doubled the 
score at 61-32 with 9 :08 left in the 
game. The Tritons, unable 10 pull 
ahead for the remainder of the 
game, threw in a basket and anoth-
er trio of threes against fOllr foul 
shots and five points off baskets for 
SDSU. 

"We really had nothing to lose by 
going into this game against a Divi-
sion I team." said freshman guard 
Roger Curtis. "Most of us were step-
ping out onto the college game court 
for the first time. You just have to 
take the experience and keep going." 

Overall, UCSD shot .321 from 
the field, with Higgins and senior 
forward Cole Miller leading in 
points, with 11 each . Higgins was 
also strong on the boards, with a 
game high seven rebounds. 
SDSU's top scorer, Randy Hol-
comb, poured in 15 points. 

UCSD will meet, Cal Poly San 
Louis Obispo ov. 20, and the next 
home game will be held after 
Thanksgiving on Nov. 29 against 
Christian Heritage at 7 p.m.

Does Anyone 
Else Smell Like 
Team Spirit? 

er 
ROBERT FULTON 

Yours truly ventured away from UCSD to watch a pair of our athletic teams com-
pete this weekend. 

OK, so I did not even get out of 
San Diego, but I did leave the con-
fines of La Jolla to watch our teams 
in action. 

I got to see the women's bas-
ketball team pull out a last-second 
win over Point Lorna Nazarene 
University on Friday, and I saw the 
men's basketball squad get 
crushed by the Division I San 
Diego State Aztecs. 

Both games showed me some-
thing that is not often seen by this 
gent - school spirit. 

Sure, there is some school spirit 
here. Thumbs up to all ofthose1h-
ton faithful who come out to 
games. Special props to those few 
whom I saw at the two road games 
I attended. But shame on those 
who never go and support the ath-
letes and just plain don't give a 
damn. 

At the State game, where our 
guys were severely outmatched but 
still tried thei r best, they played in 
the beautiful Cox Arena. This place 
is first class. There were over 4,000 
people in attendance. Can you 
imagine having that many here to 
see a game? 

At the Point Lorna game, there 
were over 500 students. Now, this 
is a small number of people. But 
further research makes this that 
much more impressive. The school 
has a little over 2,000 undergradu-
ates. That means roughly one-
fourth of the school's population 
attended the game. That is like 
5,000 people heading to the next 
UCSD men's basketball match . 
Amazing. 

This is a call for people to get 
out there and watch a Â·game. We 
have some excellent athletics teams 
- take a look at women's soccer. 
The games are fun , and they make 
you more of a part of the school. 

Another thing got me thinking: 
The Point Lorna azarene Univer-
sity gym is called the Golden Gym. 
It is nowhere near the size of our 
RlMAC Arena but it is really nice 
looking. It glows, it rocks and it has 
a nice name that gives the station 
some spice . 

That is what we need here. We 
need to rename RIMAC some-
thing that makes opponents 
shake in their boots, something 
that pertains to the Tritons. Other 
schools have names like "The 
Eagles' Nest" or "The Lions' 
Den ." How about calling RIMAC 
"Atlantis" or "The Watery 
Tomb?" 

OK, maybe not, but help me 
out. Send suggestions to me or to 
the athletic department. I'm sure 
the name can be better than "Intra-
mural Recreational Arena Auditori-
um with a Complex that is a Place 
to Play and Work Out Stadium 
Arena Thing; or whatever RlMAC 
is. 

This is just a call for everyone 
to get some school spirit into their 
systems and support the hard 
working UCSD athletic teams a 
little bit more.

What should have been a high-
pressure playoff game turned out 
to be a walk in the park as the 
UCSD women's soccer team 
downed Central Oklahoma Uni-
versity 6-2 in the quarterfinals of 
the CAA Division II playoffs. 

"I think they were a much bet-
ter team than 6-2," said Triton 
head coach Brian McManus. 
"They were young at the back, and 
that's where they made the most 
mistakes. I think that midfield, for-

than we've been turried by a lot' of

the match when Erika Alfredson

San Diego State proves too quick for a UCSD 
team that brings 10 freshmen to the table

Staff Writer 

In its first Division II game, the 
UCSD men's basketball team was 
unable to net a victory against 
cross-town rivals Division I San 
Diego State Un iversity Saturday 
night at Cox Arena. 

The 80-48 UCSD loss ended a 
17 -game losing streak . 'for the 
Aztecs, and it was the first time 
the teams had met since 1981, 
when the Tritons were also 
defeated. 

Ten of UCSD's 15 players are 
freshmen, and the Tritons are 
slated to finish 11 th out of 12 
teams in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, according to 
a recent pre-season CCAA 
Coaches' Poll. 

SDSU captured the tip-off 
and began the game with a lay-up 
at 18:44 by Aztec Karlo Koviac. 

UCSD was unable to halt a six-
poi nt, two-a nd-a- half-minute-
long streak, until freshman fo r-
ward Ryan Swed sank a three-
point shot from the corner at 
16:27, which set a pattern for the 
rest of the half. 

The Aztecs reta liated with an 
outside shot for themselves sec-
onds later, bringing the score to 
9-3. 

The ball rallied back and forth, 
with State adding several lay-ups, 
one free throw and a dunk. The 
Tritons' only scores in the first 
half came from three pointers. 
They made six of 23 attempts, 
shooting a .261 th ree-point field 
goal percentage. In the second 
half, wi th two more attempted 
baskets, the percentage was .214.
