STUDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 

AS Not Important, Shaw Says 
Carl N.iburger 

City Editor 
AS presidential candidate David Shaw 

accused his opponent Karl Keating of 
generating issues for the purpose of 
being elected. In accepting Keating's 
debate challenge in an exclusive 
TRITON TIMES interview Tuesday, he 
said Keating has "used the debate as his 
own political tool. " 

"In actuality what he (Keating) has 
done is create a certain number of 
issues," Shaw continued, "and these 
are, of course, the issues with respect to 
which he looks very good, and he puts us 
all at a tremendous disadvantage-we 
have to fight him on his ground." 

In his own campaign, Shaw states he 
wishes to "redefine the issues. First g,et 
the point across that there are no 
concrete issues and open up our horizons 
to the possibilities of admitting all sorts 
of new issues." 

Shaw says the most important issue to 
him is " the minds of the students here." 
Using the health food movement in 
analogy he says, " People are very 
concerned with what they put in their 
mouths, but no one on campus seems to 
be concerned yet with what they're 
putting into their brains, which, as I 
understand it, is the purpose of this 
educational institution. " 

AS i. Already NothiDg 
Claiming that none of the candidates 

running will "make things significantly 
different," Shaw states, "AS is already 

nothing. What I'm concerned with is 
shifting students' attention to something 
else. Under my aggressive leadership 
we could make this school the sort of 
school that wouldn 't care about its AS 
government. I think that apathy, when 
directed properly can be one of our most 
important tools." He adds, "One of the 
healthiest things I could see right now 
would be a 10 percent voter turnout in 
the coming election." 

A Voice for Dead Students 

Shaw notes, however, he definitely 
wants to be elected "to prevent some of 
these other people from being elected." 
He promises if elected he would start 
" interesting projects" such as turning 
the grass field adjacent to the Reve\1e 
Unit One dormitories into "a cemetery 
for deceased students and faculty ." 
Referring to Keating's criticisms of the 
AS budget, he points out, "After a\1, 
we're paying about $600 a day for being 
students here, and after a\1 the AS 
salaries are up to $4050 a year . I think 
we can certainly devote a bit of time and 
money to burying the people who have 
died here on campus. The dead students 
on campus rea\1y don't have a voice in 
politics. " 

He emphasizes that his campaign is 
not a jest. "I have some very serious 
things to say. There 's a more important 
ba\1park here than the Associated 

. Students, and that has to deal with the 
students themselves." The reason for 

his making such proposals as the 
cemetery, he says, is to stir up 
questions. "People have accepted 
definitions that are no longer helpful to 
them," he says. 

Shaw reveals one of his concerns is the 
students ' academic life. "Students," he 
declares " think that the right thing for a 
faculty member to do is to give them 
horrible, meaningless homework to 
make their lives miserable for them and 
then to give them grades at the end of 
the quarter, and they count themselves 
lucky if tht'ir professor is sick on some 
day or if they don 't have to turn in an 
assignment that they thought they did. 
They willingly accept the role of 
student-niggers, as Jerry Farber puts it. 
I think that 's a much more important 
consideration than 4000 of us paying 
$4050 out. " 

However , Shaw says he would not 
encourage faculty to change 
requirements or course material. 
Rather, he says, he would "encourage 
students to start thinking about 
alternatives to the point that they're so 
disgusted by an APIS class where they 
have to turn in homework by the 
fo\1owing Friday that they laugh and 
turn in crayon drawings instead, I'm 
interested in change from the bottom 
rather than change of the existing 
structures. " 

An important question, he notes, is 
" How can I go about

Regents Vote to Impliment 
Zinner Atom lob Report 

. Jonn Zoll.r 
Stoff Writer 

The Regents yesterday gave tentative approval to the main 
recommendations of a faculty report that calls for less secrecy 
and more student involvtment in the Livermore and Los 
Alamos Research Laboratories. 
The "Zinner" report, specially commissioned by the 

statewide Academic Senate to study the University's relations 
to the two controversial nuclear research facilities, made its 
findings public last June, and has since been ratified by 75 per 
cent of the UC faculty on a mail ba\1ot. On the same ballot 57 
per cent of the statewide faculty also voted to continue 
contractual agreements between the Regents and the Atomic 
Energy Commission which specify operation of the research 
centers. 

The approval took the form of a point-by-point response to 
each recommendation of the Zinner report by the Regents' 
standing committee on Special Research Projects, the 
Regental panel that normally monitors activity in the labs on 
behalf of the University. 

In response to the Zinner report recommendations, the 
Regents agreed to: 

(1 ) Set up a committee of "distinguished persons with 
experience relevant to the Laboratories' program" in order to 
review the programs of the two research centers. The Regents 
agreed that no member of this committee should come from 
outside the University , and that the committee should be 
"watchful" over the ratio of weapons to non-weapons work, 
and over the proportion of basic to applied science research. 

(2) Scde down areas of research that are secret or 
classified , although the Regents noted that this is already their 
policy contingent only on the requirements of national 
security. 

(3) Increase the graduate training functions of the 
laboratories as more projects are ruled open to students. The 

~egents stated, however, that the biggest limitation to 
IDcreased student training in the lab is funding and not 
security. 

(4) Grant the Lawrance Radiation Labs at Berkeley 
administrative independence from Livermore. It was felt that 
since the radiation labs, involved almost exclusively in top 
Secret research, and Livermore is much less classified, the 
separation would fac(litate opening up the latter to a wider 
range of projects. 

(5) Involve the top administrators of the two labs in regular 
University function., although the Regents contended that they 
are already doing so insofar as it is practical. The Regents also 
agreed to consult a broader spectrum of opinions, including the 
opinions of students working in the labs, in choosing new 
directors. The Re,ents stressed, al did the faculty report, that 
there should be no challles that milht jeopardize national 
security.

Report to Regents 

Watson Stresses Third College's Quality 
Jonn Zoller 
Stoff Writ.r 

"On the whole, Third College 
has come out as we hoped it 
would, Provost Joseph Watson 
told the Regents ' Committee 
on Educational· Policy 
yesterday at their regular 
monthly meeting in Los 
Angeles. In a six-month report 
back to the Regents on the 
progress of the fledgling 
minority-oriented college, 
Watson assured the Regents 
that although there were 
problems there were no more 
than should be expected in any 
new program." 

In other action affecting 
UCSD, the Committee on 
Grounds and Buildings gave 
preliminary approval for a 
$650,000 addition to the 
gymnasium to provide another 
full-size basketba\1 court and 
additional office and workshop 
space; while the Educational 
Policy Committee deferred a 
decision on whether to a\1ow 
the Pepper Canyon School to 
continue on campus next year. 

In his 10-minute report, 
Watson touched on the 
academic quality , faculty 
recruiting and anticipated 
growth rate of the new Third 
College. Discussing academic 
standards, Watson disclosed 
that 30 of 106 students in the 
college, or about 18 percent, 
were on academic probation 
with less than a 2.0 GPA. This 
compare with 8 per cent at 
Revelle and 7 per cent at Muir. 

To maintain the quality of 
education as high as possible, 
Watson said a premium has 
been placed on regular use of 
discussion sections. The 
student-faculty ratio for 
freshman courses was IS-I, he 

said. The University wide 
average is now over 28-1. 

Particularly in science 
classes, Watson said, where 
minority students often have 
poor high school training, an 
effort has been made to have 
regular faculty members 
taking discussion sections. The 
results have been "gratifying," 
he told the Regents. 

Watson related one lesson 
which Thitd College has 
learned this year. " In order for 
students to get involved with 
science, despite their poor 
backgrounds," he said, "we 
chose to present biology first , 
because that seems the most 
relevant to students. However, 
we want to link the different 
courses of the science sequence 
together, and we have found 
that it is difficult to use biology 
as a basis for chemistry. 
NormaUy ·it is the other way 
around." 

Watson, whose own training 
is in chemistry, said he hopes 
to find a solution to this 
problem. 

In terms of growth rate, 
Watson hopes to expand at a 
slower rate than either Muir or 
Revelle , although he is 
uncertain what enro\1ment 
pressures may develop to 
change those plans. Next year, 
the co\1ege will approximately 
double in size, to around 400 
students. 

"Our biggest problem," 
Watson said. "ha to do with 
the national press, which treats 
us a con trover ial new rather 
than as an educational 
institution. That problem, he 
said, "we haven 't handled very 
well ." 

Regarding the Pepper 
Canyon School, Chancellor 
York explained to the TRITON 

TIMES' that " In order to 
satisfy the Regents that it 

. should be a\1owed to continue 
on campus, we will have to 
make it clear that Pepper 

Canyon School is an activity of, 
by and for our students, and not 
a commercial activity."

the process of being a student? 
Why leave it 1,0 the faculty to 
decide how your class is going 
to be run? " " We are led to 
believe that we can't know 
what's going on in the subject 
unless we accept learning from 
the teacher in his teacher role. 
It 's perfectly possible to use a 
facuIty member in an advisory 
capacity or in a plenary 
capacity to decide what work 
you're goin~ to do." 

In explaining his role as a 
candidate, he says, "I have to 
use every chance I can get to 
act as a mouthpiece for those of 
us who feel that nothing is going

interesting is happening, that 
students are being relegated to 
poSitions of slaves. It's not a 
matter of an oppressive faculty 
or administration , it's simply 
that students are thinking of 
themselves as servile." • 

Shaw says he can use AS " by 
inserting myself as a sahot and 
letting myself interact with 
them (other candidates) in 
their normal procedures. I can 
throw myself in the middle of it 
and turn it into something more 
interesting. "

He is not, be says, acting as a 
political spoiler for another 
candidate. "Actually I was 
considering this at one time but 
I couldn't find a candidate to 
turn over my support to so I'll 
have to do the job myself." 

Asked about other candidates 
he said, " Diddo Clark turns my 
stomach and fascinates me at 
the same time." He said she 
was running a high school 
campaign. With regard to her 
platform in which she states, 
"I want to help the Associated 
Students become a body that 
can help other students make 
the changes they want to 
make," Shaw said , "I think 
everybody should be able to do 
everything. I support all her 
positions. " 

About Paul Kaufman, Shaw 
said "1 have the impression 
that he's deadly serious about 
this campaign and I think that's 
sort of a tragedy. I will really 
feel sorry for Paul Kaufman in 
this campaign. But I really feel 
we will have to take into 
consideration the needs and 
wants and feelings of the other 
97 percent of the people who 
aren 't internalized into the AS 
structu re before we consider 
people like Paul Kaufman who 
really would like to be prom 
queen."

Mass Rally Slated on EOP Fund Crisis 
Raoul Contr.ras 

StoHWrit., 

Budget tightening at the federal and state level has cr~ated a 
financial crisis for UCSD's EOP students, accordIng to 
Francisco Estrada, MECHA chairman. In an effort \0 deal 
with a looming shortage of funds, representatives from 
MECHA, BSU , UCSD Asian-Americans, and UCSD Native-
Americans have organized a mass meeting for Monday, 7 p.m. 
in Bldg. 201 Mathews Campus. 

Circulating leaflets and regular broadcasts from radio 
station KSDT are presently urging all EOP s~d~nts to at~nd 
the meeting. Representatives from the orgamzattons plannmg 
the meeting expressed hope it will produce a common strategy. 
supported by all EOP students, with which to deal with the 
crisis. 

At a MECHA meeting Wednesday night Lawrence Dryer, 
director of financial aids at UCSD, outlined the problem as he 
saw it. He said that expected funding from federal and state 
levels (including Regents ' funds) amounted \0 $502,152. When 
he subtracted the amount of grants for this year's EOP 
students (who will continue next year ) and the amount 91 
financial aid for non-EOP students, there remained 
approximately $130,000 for his estimate of 200 new freshman 
EOP students for next year. This broke down to just over half 
of the average EOP grant of $1l00. . . 

Dryer expressed confidence that they could deal With thIS 
discrepency by cutting the average EOP grant \0 not m~ch 
more than $100. He said this would mostly be done by cuttIng 
the aid of continuing sophmores, juniors. and seniors. He 
admitted there was an uncertainty to these figures howeve!:, as

there was no way of telling exactly how much federal funding 
(EOG) would be received. 

Dryer showed that nation-wide colleges and universities had 
requested $156 million in EOG funds . Congress has presently 
appropriated $64 million. If UCSD's request In ~OG ~und~ IS 
cut proportionately. then the $244,000 that the Fmanclal Aids 
Office is counting on would be reduced to $64,IlO. 

Dryer felt the relatively small congressional appropriation 
(which he thought might yet be increased) was due partly \0 
changing priorities in Washington, "The big push from 
Washington is community colleges," he stated. 

Finally Dryer felt the problem might be partly alleviated ~y 
the new state California Opportunity Grants (COG) . He saId 
the new four-year scholarship program was "geared to the 
EOP student'· with the first criterm being high need rather 
than academic record. He said optimistically that there might 
be ~ of next year 's freshman EOP students receiving such 
grants. 

In a discussion following his presentation MECHA students 
tended to see the financial squeeze as more severe than did 
Dryer. According to Francisco Estrada, MECHA chairman. 
while Dryer had calculated an average cut of "only '100" with 
an estimated 200 new freshmen students, recruitment 
programs by Chicanos, Blacks, Native-Americans and Asian-
Americans project as least 300 new EOP students. He said that 
this estimate was based on the 700 applications held by the 
student recruitment programs. During his talk Dryer was 
asked if Financial Aids could handle 300 new EOP students, 

- and he replied that at the moment he didn 't see how it could be 
done. 

Estrada also said a cut of $100 is also more serious than it 
sounds. He pointed out that this year's EOP students had 
already absorbed an average cut of between $1()()'200 from last 
year's average EOP grant. " If they keep cutting ,1()()'200 a 
year , pretty soon there won't be any EOP program at all." He 
concluded that Monday nights meeting has been called because 
"something has to be done now." And by getting all EOP 
students together "we will go in united."

Teacher Corps Seeking Student Interns 
On Monday, April 19, representatives of the Teadter Corpt 

WIll be on campus to describe their program to students who 
might be interested in becoming interns in the corps. The 
federally funded program assists colleges, universities, and 
school districts in training qualified college graduates in 
special skills required for teaching children from 
disadvantaged areas, according to Maxine Bailey of UCSD's 
Career Education Planning Center. 

Most Teacher Corps projects. according to Miss Bailey, 
serve poor children in urban areas, although the Corps also 
reaches rural areas from Appalachia to Indian Reservations. 
Further Information is available at Career Planning Services, 
sixth floor of Building 20. Appointments with Teacher Corps 
representatives can be made at ext. 2401. 

AS Candidates to Debate 
Ca ndidates hr AS office will "debate the issues" on 

Wednesday at 8: 30 in the Revelle Cafeteria, according to 
Program Board Chairman Dan Spellins. The meeting is open to 
everyone . Petitions for AS candidates are due today (Friday) 
at the AS office in MC 250. A meeting of all candidates to 
discuss election procedures will be held Monday, April 19 at 6 
p.m. in Conference Room A. 

Microcirculatory Society Honors Professor 
Dr. Benjamin W. Zweifach , professor of Bioengineering at 

the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine, will 
be honored Friday, April 16 by the Microcirculatory Society 
during their annual meeting in ~hicago. . . 

The society selected Dr. Zwelfach as the 1971 reCIpIent of the 

E. M. Landis Award for his outstanding scholarl)' chievement 
and contributions to the field of microcirculation, the study of 
circulation in the small blood vessels. The award will be 
presented at a banquet Friday evening during which Dr. 
Zweifach will deliver the keynote address. 

Dr. Zweifach has been studying microcirculation for 30 
years. Since joining the faculty at UCSD six years ago, he has 
pioneered the development of instruments and micro-
techniques for measuring the bJood flow and pressure in the 
small veins. Recent work has made it possible to analyze for 
the first time derangements of small vessel functions. 

Results of his research will be applicable to the study and 
treatment of diabetes, high and low blood pressure. shock and 
aging. Methods developed by Dr. Zweifach are also being used 
in the study of kidney function . 

Beach Policy Discussion Slated 
" The Beach - Ours? Yours? Theirs?" will be the topic of an 

open discussion on Saturday, April 17, at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, sponsored by the La Jolla Town Council, Parks 
and Beaches Committee. The meeting will start at noon with a 
bring-your-own-picnic and a sand-castle contest on the beach, 
south of the Scripps pier. At 1 p.m. the group will gather in 
Sumner Auditorium to hear Assemblyman Pete Wilson discuss 
his bill to govern the coastline and Eric Carruthers from Santa 
Clara. representing the Coastal Alliance, a citizens group 
concerned with coastal legislation, to provide background on 
the other bills that are pending before the legislature and how 
they relate to San Diego County. 

Authors Of all the bills affecting our coastline have been 
invited to attend or send a representative, as have city and 
county governmental agencies and citizens groups. 

Topics to be considered will include: What standards should 
be set by the state lind left to local or regional governments to 
enforce? How far inland from the high tide line should 
jurisdiction cover? What type of appeal system should land 
holders have when confronted with state authority, standards 
or decisions? Should a coastal zone plan provide for selective 
growth or no growth? 

Karl Zo bell will serve as the moderator of the meeting and 
Jeffrey Frautschy and F.N. Spie:;s and others of Scripps 
Institution will be in attendance. William Leisk of Claremont, 
Lawrence Lawver and John Mudie will be in charge of the 
sand-castle contest. The Park and Beach Committee is chaired 
by Claude Ford , and Mrs. F. N. Spiess and John C. Rose are 
helping with arrangements.

Coffee Hut Cancels T.GJ.F. 
Parties Because of Beer 

The Coffee Hut has cancelled any further "Thank God It 's 
Friday" (TGIF) parties " for the moment," in the hopes . of 
alleviating a potential alcohol and drug p~oblem , says ~Im 
McGill . a member of the Coffee Hut CommIttee. The parttes, 
held for the past few weeks on Friday afternoon at the Coff-:e 
Hut and sponsored by Alpha Sigma Phi, have dispensed beer In 
apparent contradiction of campus alchohol policies. .. 

Additionally, the Coffee Hut's regular weekend and vacatton 
operations have been plagued by " brown baggers .. " people 
bringing their own alcohol and drugs. Dunng the spring break, 
says McGill , many local high school students frequented the 
Coffee Hut and brought enough alcohol to fill up three to four 
trash cans a night with bottles. 

Vice-Chancellor George Murphy, as a result, has recently 
received many calls of complaint from UCSD students, and one 
from the San Diego Police Dept. asking if Murphy was aware 
of the problem. Subsequently, Murphy and the Coffee Hut 
Committee, in meetings held in the last few weeks, made the 
decision regarding the TGIF parties. With in the next few 
weeks they hope to formulate a policy regarding the so called 
"brown baggers," a policy which may mean revision of the 
campus-wide policies concerning alcohol. 

Local Group Plans Bus to 
April 24 SF Peace Rally 

Plans for organizing local 
anti-war acti vi ties were 
announced this week by the San 
Diego Peace Action Council. In 
announcing the opening of its 
local office at 5525 Campanile 
Dr .. a SDPAC spokesman said 
that one of the main goals of 
the organization is heavy 
representation by San Diego at 
an anti-war rally on April 24 . 

Among the local anti-war 
activities scheduled to precede 
the San Francisco march is a 
" Day of Alternative

a student strike at La Jolla 
High School April 23. The local 
activities are intended to 
generate support of the San 
Francisco march as well as one 
in Washington D.C. on the 
same day. 

Kitt said that bus tickets to 
San Francisco can be

Reagan Blows Our Mind 
While it has become obvious that 

Reagan is no friend of the University, 
we are yet to receive one of his most 
devastating blows. . 

The worst budget in four years of 
slim-pickings calls for a zero increase 
for next year . It appears that Reagan 
has wa ll ed himself off from the needs 
of the UC system. Using the most 
simplistic method available to soothe. 
overburdened taxpayers, Reagan 's 
naivete closes out real ity in favor of 
ma inta ining a highly detrimental 
status quo. 

Unfortunately for us, nothing stays 
constant from one year to the next, a 
fac t which Reagan totally and 
probably willfully ignores. Not only 
will his budget provide less facilities 
for an increasing amount of students, 
but it will also force serious reductions 
in the quality of education of which we 
are so justly proud in California . 

The approval of Reagan's budget 

would cut about 100 FTE faculty 
positions, raising the student-faculty 
ratio. It would halt needed 
construction, repairs, and' 
renovations. While we experience an 
annual six per cent inflation, no raises 
would be given to the UC faculty or 
staff. Organized research would lose 
about S3 million, threatening the jobs 
of nearly 200 valuable scientific and 
research personnel. 

Long range effects might include the 
possibil ity of faculty and staff 
members leaving for better positions 
elsewhere, leaving our present 
facilities not only overcrowded, but 
also deteriorated in quality as well . 

One thing is certain: it is the 
Legislature, and not Reagan, who can 
and must be convinced that a realistic 
UC budget is essential to any sort of 
future for the University of California. 
OtherWise, Reagan's budget will 
furnish ·the nails for UC 's coffin . 

Existential Elections 
The Associated Students has kindly 

condescended to fill the lull in activity 
this spring by scheduling an election. 
Six people, at last count, have 
volunteered to sacrifice themselves as 
candidates. 

Regretably, however, some people 
may be inclined to take the election 
seriously. We would liketo correct this 
notion by presenting our readers with 
the facts of the situation. . 

The Associated Students is not a 
government. II is an officially 
sanctioned organization with the basic 
function of spending the 56 a quarter 
collected in student activit ies fees. 
Despite Mr. Keating's utterances, this 
is really small potatoes when we 
consider that 5100 collected fr m 
every student each quarter goes to 
fund most student services such as the 
health service, counseling and 
psychological services, and even the 
campus-wide Program Board. The 
Reg istration Fee committee, an 
administration board having a few 
student members, is responsible for 
spending these funds . 

Then what are these candidates for 
AS off ice running for? They are 
running to be in a position to decide 
how our 56 is to be spent. On the side, 
they would be able to appoint a few 
token student representatives to 
admin istrative committees and attend 
Regents meetings as Official student 
spokesmen. 

Th is is the glory they will obtain 
after all the acrobatics and 
recriminations of an election 
campaign . 

Nevertheless, we can count the 
annual elections as an edUcational 
experience. They provide us with the 
opportunity to marvel at the 
philosophical and social attitudes 
expressed through the candidates 
ant ics. 

In sum, the election is a dialectic. 
After all is over, we will be back with 
the same old AS for another year, still 
spending our 56, although perhaps in a 
different manner or on a voluntary 
basis. The change we can reasonably 
hope for is to have grown from the 
experience.

Campaign Time 

For Your Informotion, Karl ••• 
Paul Kaufman . 

As a serious candidate for the office of A.S. 
PreSident, I accept Mr. Keating's challenge to a 
public debate. We have already reserved the 
Revelle cafeteria for Wednesday evening, April 
21 , begiMing at 8:30 p.m. However,I would lite 
to note tJtat my delay In answering is due only to 
the fact tJtat Karl issued the challenge in the 
Friday I April 9 edition of the Tritol! TImes, and 
then submitted a second article for publication 
on the following Tuesday re-issuing the 
challenge ; the second article was, in fact, 
submitted to the 'M' office the same day that the 
first article appeared in print--in short, before I 
could make a reply. 

ne PseHo-lsnel 
Far more important, however, are the rather 

serious mistakes which Keating asserts as fact : 
"of the $77,000 that the A.S. brought in last year, 
$30,000 went into the salaries of a few." In truth, 
on ly $4,350 is allocated for stipends out of the 
$77,000 income of the A.S.: $900 per year for the 
A.S. President, $450 for the V.P., $600 for the 
Program Board Chairman, and $300 for each of 
the other eight Council-members. Taking into 
considera tion that the President must spend 
time during the summer representing the 
interests of students to the administration, and 
given that he has a ~ hour work-week during 
the school year, it would not appear that a 
salary of $900 for 12 months hard work is 
excessive. Moreover. given the level of work, 
the elected official will be unable to carry more 
than 12 units a quarter if the job of president is 
to be done well , which necessitates his going a 
fifth year to graduate. Even applying the $900 
stipend toward the costs of that fifth year (and 
working during the summer), I know tJtat I, at 
leas!, could not make ends meet. The 
importance of the office, however, justifies the 
burden. 

If Mr. Keating then wants to cite the recent 
referendum as evidence tJtat students oppose 
stipends, let us not forget (1) that only about 10 
per cent of the student body voted (indicating 
the unimportance and general lack of interest in 
this " issue" ); (2) that a frequent comment 
among those casting ballots (and often the 
reason for those who abstained) was simply : " I 
don't have enough knowledge to judge" ; (3) that 
another frequent comment was "only if they 
deserve it" (if the person who holds an office is 
not doing his job, he does not deserve the 
stipend and it sIIoalcl be withheld); (4) that 
there was only a few votes difference between 
those favoring (187) and those opposing (186 ) 
(which justifies the election of representatives 
in the first place, viz., to use their best 
j udgment to decide issues which they are in the 
best position to assess and which ar.e Ht clear 
cut ). 

Another allegation that Kealing has made is 
that I refuse to ru~ an " issues-oriented 
campaign" but instead plan to " run on my 
record." This is not at all correct. I plan to run 
on my platform (to be published in the 'M' 
election issue) ; I wish merely to point out that 
experience in the A.S. (which neither Keating 
nor Diddo have ) is necessary if the A.S. 
President is gojng to be able to make the 
University bureaucracy work to the advantage 
of stu~ents and if he is ever to maximize the 
capabilities of the A.S. 

Oa to tbe Raillne. 
Keating argues that A.S. Fees should not be 

compulsory, but voluntarily paid. If that were 
the case, he further argues, " large amounts of 
student taxes could not be spent on projects that 
involved only a few." 

At this point in time and along the lines which 
Keating has in mind, voluntary fees would 
result in nothing less than the collapse of the 
A.S. as a viable and useful body. The Simple 
reality of the situation is tJtat no one pays fees 
voluntarily (the reasoning here goes something 
like this: "Why should I pay anything when 
everyone else's money can go to pay for A.S. 
services?"). And, as anyone who has taken 
Econ. lA can tell you, there is 110 way to charge 
people other tJtan by mandatory fees for 
services offered for the public good. and that is 
what the A.S. spends the greater part of its 
budget on. Programming is the only area in 
which students could be directly repaid for their 
membership by discounts at Program Board 
functions ; but even those who receive an 
economic advantage may decide not to pay fees 
every quarter. or, more likely, they might not 
want to pay the full amount. But it is obviously 
impossible to budget anything in advance when 
your income is unpredictable. Given voluntary 
fees, even supposing you knew how much money 
would be coming in ; it would still be insufficient 
to maintain the services the A .S. provides, and 
would still necessitate the A.S. having to borrow 
money to put up for concerts (and tJtat would 
multiply the cost of tickets for everyone by 
several fold ). Indeed, over half the A.S. budget 
goes to non-programming student services for 
which it woUld be impossible to collect 
payment. For example, the A.S. contributes 
about the same number of dollars to the 
(Chancellor:s) Communications Board (which 
is responsible for campus media ) as it does to 
programming. KSDT and the Trite. Times 
(both of which render valuable services to the 
student body) are funded bv that board ; yet 
without those dollars, the TT and the radio 
station would have to close down if left to pay 
for themselves. 

If taxes are not collected, other worthwhile 
projects would also have to be terminated ; the 
question boils down, in short, to a matter of 
priorities. An undertaking which is limited to, 
say, a small minority of students for whom the 
costs of supporting the undertaking themselves 
would be prohibitive, may nevertheless 
represent something worthwhile to fund in what 
I have termed the "public good" or "general 
interest." Hence, money oqbt to be spent on 
MECHA (whose membership is, of course, 
limited to a relatively small group), or BSU 
(participation being limited to Blacks), or a 
day-care center (limited to mothers ). Clearly, 
only tax .money is now available for such 
purposes. 

Finally, Keating proposes to decentralize the 
A.S. The obvious problem here, of course, is 
that the A.S. commissioners perform functions 
which are, by their v~ry nature, campus-wide 
rather than college-wide in scope : the student 
lobby, Del Mar bus service, campus 
programming, and so on, are not intended for 
the e,:clusive benefit of either Muir, Revelle, or 
Third College students, but for all students 
needing that service. (No one disagrees that 
college governments should take the leading 
role in affairs internal and limited to the 
college , as, for example , graduation 
requirements. ). 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Asian Brothers 
and Sisters . .. 

Dear A.1u brotben .ad 
slaten, 

We are concerned Asian 
students at U .C. Davis that 
need your help. We are 
convinced tJtat the spring 
offensive against the Indo-
China war must be coupled 
with significant Asian 
participation and a meaningful 
Asian perspective. To reach · 
these ends, we have organized 
on the Davis c.mpus Asians 
against the war. 

Please help us by responding 
to the (ollowilll questions: I ) 
what do your organizations 
have planned in the line of anti-
war activities? 2) would you be 
interested in organizing an 
Asian contigent for the anti· 
war march In San Francisco on 
April 24th? 3) have you any 

• 
current research on a) the 
effect of the war on Asians in 
Indo-China or b) the effect of 
the war on Asians in America? 

We are concerned with new 
approaches and new ideas. 
Could you send us any and all 
materials dealing with the war 
and names of people to contact 
for more support' and 
information to stop the war. 
Any help will be appreciated. 
Hope to be hearing from you as 
soon as possible.

Apologize! 
E4iter, 

In the TRITON TIMES on 
¥arch 30, Jim Sills acculed me 
oJ exp~eSling ".ppreval of 

many of the criticisms leveled 
at Third College" . That's a lie. 
I think Third College is a rare 
example of the state of 
California actually addressing 
a cbronic social need- the need 
for non-toke n minority 
education. The need has not 
been met but Third College is a 
step in the right direction. I'd 
like Sills to apologize and 
retract his slanderous 
Ilatement. 

Why Debate? 

Diddo, Diddo Here's Where You Are 
Diddo Clark 

Last week I was challenged to debate but my 
challenger didn't present any substantive issues 
to contend with. 

He wanted to "eliminate student government 
salaries." What a racist elitist idea! Most 
students are poor--IF THE A.S. DOESN'T PAY 
REAL MONEY, ONLY UPPER-MIDDLE 
CLASS KIDS WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE. 
Third College students would be eliminated and 
the A.S. would become a joke of an oligarchy. 

" If elected, be would refuse a stipend." Would 
that all of us could afford to do that! 

This year the Associated StUdents will be 
paying its eleven elected officers a total of 
$3,750.00 (according to Nora Aust, the StUdent 
Activities bookkeeper in Vice-Chancellor 
Murphy's office ) for guarding student interests; 
communicating with students, facul ty, 
administration, regents, legislators, and the 
community; and bringing us the north county 
bus, the Friday Night Flicks, concerts, dances, 
and other activities. That costs us each an 
average of 85 cents a quarter. 

The challenger informed the Triton Times 
that "of the $77,000 that the A.S. brought in last 
year, $30,000 went into the salaries of a few." 
That's not true. Again according to bookkeeper 
Nora Aust, the figures look lite this: 

1969-70 1970-71 

total A. S. $86,138.00 $83,842.34 income 

amount paid $21 ,137.94 $13,851.68 
for salaries 

per cent paid 
25 percent 16.5 percent for salaries 

recipients of secretaries. secretaries, 
salaries box office Coffee Hut and 

manager, social events 
bookkeeper, chairmen, 
some campus Friday Night 
media people, Flicks 
A.S. officers chairman and 

ticket taker, 
bookkeeper. 
A.S. officers 

He also claimed " that some KSDT salaries 
run as high as $1 ,800 to $2,400 annually." 
Actually, the total cost i which is paid by the 
Registration Fee Committee and not the 
Associated Students ) is $1 ,800.00 for a year-
round station manager , program director, 
engineer, and all other radio station personnel. 

He would like " to turn over one-half to two-
thirds of A.S. income to the college 
governments." That is certainly not in our 
interests. The A.S. is the otdy student 
government on campus. Revelle College 
government is composed of administrators and 
students; the Third College Board of Directors 
is half faculty and half student; the Muir 
College Council is mostly non-sludents. 

The Associated Students is not very exciting 
but it's really all we have. U's our labor union 
and social, cultural , and communications 
center. The atmosphere hete is much different 
from that on other U .C. campuses-owe get the 
best education and have the lowest attrition 
rate. The Associated Students could really 
contribute to our campus life. 

I just want to help ... bring more energy and 
good people into the A.S ., get Registration Fee 
money into student hands, set up a grocery store 
and quali ty food service on campus, and start 
building the Student Center (There is $151 ,301.40 
of our money in the Student Center Fund, not 
counting interest. Next fall , according to 
enrollment projections made by the Office of 
Analytical Studies. there will be about $189,755. 
We need arts and crafts facilities now. We need 
a theater now. Triton Times and KSDT need 
space now. What good will it do us to build a 
Student Center when we 're all gone? ). 

These are some of the real issues Mr. 
Keating- not shall we or shall we not destroy the 
Associated Students. I have no quarrel with you 
- and I have no desire to debate you - I want to 
spend my tIme getting things done.

Clayton Proposal 

What are the "Issues"? 
Philip Chandler Grad. History 

Elections to the AS Council 
have recently become an 
important source of articles in 
'IT and, less conceivably, a 
focus of thought in the UCSD 
community. I should like to 
make a few observations. 

First, we are asked to 
consider the relevance of a 
campaign oriented toward 
"issues," as deCined by one 
Karl Keating. His major points 
of contention include the 
dissolution of some $4000 in 
salaries given to the Council , a 
proposal of mind-boggling 
proportions. He wants the 
placement of payment of AS 
fees on an arbitrary basis, a 
suggestion of such marvellous 
naivete that one wonders 
whether this gentleman has 
ever encountered such exoteric 
documents as the Federalist 
papers or the U.S. Constitution 
(not to mention the works of 
Locke , Rou sseau , and 
Montesquieu). And, he calls for 
the decentralization of UCSD 
government; an " issue" for 
which he has advanced no 
arguments; and the institution 
of frequent referenda , a safety-
valve presumably designed 
with the presumption that the 
Council does not in fact know 
what students want or need. 

My criticism of all these 
proposals stems from the fact 
that these are " issues" 
defined, as it were, from on 
high, or rather (as we know 
from other articles attributed 
to Mr. Keating) from a defini te 
ideological bias. Ipso facto, 
they have questionable 
relevance to actua I concerns of 
students. Perllaps the question 
one should ask is: do I support 
a legislative program 
emana ling from and 
determined by Karl Keating 's 
predispositions? 

I assume the answer to this 
question is, for most of us, 
negative. Further. I suggest 
that the reason for our 
response is that we do not 
conceive of ourselves as 
constituting a coherent body of 
thought, need, and desire. 
Hence. no one with a set of

"issues" already established 
will be speaking for many of us. 
That is. we are at present a 
plarality of interests (more or 
less iII-{iefined l, yet having the 
potentiality of reaching some 
common understanding of a 
good common to all , some 
articulation of the res publica, 
the public thing. We find 
ourselves faCing the question of 
how best to actualize this 
potentiality. There are no easy 
answers here ; we must teach 
ourselves. 

Shall we, then , learn the 
common good by electing 
ordinary charismatic figures 
like Diddo Clark or Paul 
Kaufman? Certainly, they 
present more persuasive cases 
than does Karl Keating 
because they at least recognize 
the existence of real pluralities 
(a rather different idea than 
the artificial plurality Mr. 
Keating would recognize in the 
federated colleges ). However, 
I suggest that, in principle, the 
posit ions of Clark and Kaufman 
caMot advance beyond the 
satisfaction of this or that 
particular demand or request 
as they arise. This policy of 
mediated satisfaction is a 
useful but hardly ennobling 
goa\. It is a t once a means and 
a rationalization for letting the

As a first approxima tion to a 
workable system through 
which we can together learn 
what our common good is, what 
we ought to will , and what is of 
actual importance for us as 
citizens of a potentially just 
comml y, James Clayton 's 
proposal lor elections to the AS 
Council must be given serious 
consideration. I , too. " have 
faith that we as individuals are 
capable of making a rational 
decision." 

This letter will, I hope, not be 
taken as other than a tentative, 
first recollection of principles. 
At best, it may be both an 
adumbration of a rigourous 
argument for rational self-
government and , in particular, 
a partial theoreti c al 
justification for Mr. Clayton 's 
imaginative proposal. At least. 
it may suggest the need , so 
clearly descried by Robert 
Paul Wolff. for a political 
philosophy of community, 
beyond mere pluralism. I hope 
that this letter may provoke 
serious thought about our 
common life and not mere 
rejoinder from the notables 
Keating, Clark, and Kaufman, 
whose names have been useful 
in eliciting points in theory.

POSSIBILITIES 
THE COMMITTEE 

The Committee , San 
Francisco 's famous satirical 
review, will present a progra~ 
of skits, sketches and songs m 
the UCSD gymnasium 
Saturday, April 17, at 8 p.m. 

Material for the show is 
derived from wholly -
improvised performances 
based on suggestions from The 
Committee's San Francisco 
audiences. 

The cabaret - type theater 
opened its doors on April 10, 
1963, and was originated by 
producer - director Alan 
Myerson, formerly of " Second 
City" in Chicago. 

Now in its eighth 
uninterrupted year , The 
Committee has played a 
limited 100week engagement on 
Broadway in New York, and a 
second company has had an 
extended two-year stay in Los 
Angeles' Tiffany Theater.

students with ID. 

Chicago 
On Sunday. April 25, Chicago 

will appear in concert at 8 p.m.

Chicago, born in the city of 
the same name, was simply a 
bar and dance band, bu t is now 
a big band playing jazz, 
classics. rock and roll , brass 
and all that is the nature of 
their music. The group itself is 
experimental in that it is .not 
afraid to make any mUSICal 

. attempt tha t will yield further 
progress. 

In Chicago the group started 
under the name of " Big 
Thing." After they found 
Chicago was no longer 
receptive to their type of 
sounds, they moved to Los 
Angeles. changed their name to 
Chicago Transit Authority and 
began concentra l ing on 
creating and improving their 
style. Chicago, their present 
full name. is now the biggest

Tritons Triumph 7-0 
Last Wednesday Balboa Stadium was empty to capacity as 

the Tritons blitzed San Diego City College 1-0. It was the first 
victory of the spring JV season for UCSD. 

The Triton defense was magnificent, allowing only two shots 
on goal in the entire first half. Anchored by Robert Van Valin in 
goal and Ray Carrillo, Aaron Horton and Mark Schneider at the 
fullback positions, the defense held City College in check 
throughout the game, although the latter were aided by about 
15 offside penalties awarded to SDCC by the referee . 

Halfbacks Jorge Rivas, Tony, Stewart Hayes and Norm 
Shapiro, who arrived from Dartmouth just in time to 
contribute a superlative effort, helped on both ends of the field 
as they not only aided the defense but also carried the figjjt to 
City College. Led by forward Carlos Robles, who fired in the 
deciding score, David Riss, Oscar Vocal and Francisco Luna 
kept the heat on the SDCC defense constantly. Both Robles and 
Luna had great games, leading the offense and firing barrages 
of shots. 

The Tritons were the aggressor from the start, but the ball 
simply wouldn't find its way into the enemy goal. Shot after 
shot came close or was deflected away. Even when the SDCC 
goalie was caught out of position, another red-shirted player 
was in the way. During the first half, the SDCC goalie bobbled 
the ball into the goal but retracted it quickly; this should have 
been a UCSD score, but apparently the referee was not in a 
position to see the play, and thus the Tritons were denied a 
goal. 

SDCC used a fast break attack and several times Slipped 
through for what could have been easy goals. But Lady Luck 
and some good saves by the goalkeeper preserved the Triton 
victory. By just plain good work and playing the offside rule to 
perfection, Schneider, Carrillo and Horton shut off the SDCC 
attack. 

The Tritons have been undefeated so far this quarter. Last 
week UCSD was tied by Southwestern College, which up until 
that game had a perfect record and was leading the league. The 
Tritons fought back from a 3-0 deficit to tie the game at 3-3. 
Then UCSD blew a couple of gimme's late in the game, and the 
contest ended at 3-3. Riss, Vocal and Luna scored for the 
Tritons. 

The record for the 1971 JV soccer season is 1-3-1. Forget last 
quarter. The next Triton home game is April 16 on the MC 
field . Fool everyone and come. .
