University undergraduates 
have admitted that several 
fellow students fabricated the 
informatiou contained in a 
current Rolling Stone,maga-
zine expc*, which explores 
the university's active heroin 
subcdltiare. The students 
featured in the article, titled 
"The Hard Core Curriculum," 
are accused by 'Classmates of 
making up stories about 
widespread drug use on the 
campus, in order to create a 
national stir. According the 
article, the mythical "D-Party" 
sponsors bi-weekly heroin 
bashes, where the 40 to 60 
attendees smoke, snort or 
shoot up. University officials 
denied that the campus has a 
serious drug problem.

LEXINGTON, KY - An

Building laboratories forced 
the evacuation of hundreds of 
students and faculty for nearly 
an hour on Monday morning. 
Investigators believe an 
unexpected electrical charge 
caused a beaker, holding silyl 
hydride and trityl chloride, to 
explode. A professor heard the 
explosion at 10:50 a.m., and 
emergency crews entered the

aside from this explosion and 
a radiation spill last October,

'Teach-In' Provokes Varied Responses 
PROGRAM: Panels 
voice support for 
affirmative action 
ByM.ryH ...... ' 
Staff Writer 

Several hundred people attended 
a teach-in addressing the future of 
affirmative-action programs at the 
Price Center on Tuesday. Entitled 
"The Politics of Division," the pro-
gram featured guest speakers who 
voiced strong support for the pres-
ervation of affirmative-action pro-

grams in the UC system. 
The event was sparked by debate 

over the controvenial California 
Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), 
which proposes the ending of affir-
mative action in both public educa-
tion and employment. 

The nearly four-hour-Iong pro-
gram was led by a panel of five 
visiting university professors, and 
accompanied by several student 
speakers. The professors lectured 
not only on the future of affirmative 
action, but also on issues such as 
racism, college admissions, leader-

ship and community participation. ren sophomore Maggie Steffensen, 
disagreed. Throughout the program, CCRI 

opponenbattacked the idea thataf-
firmative action is no longer neces-
sary to create a multi-ethnic envi-
ronment. 

"CCRI states that there'll be no 
gender, racial orspecial preferences 
for anyone," she said. "I don't ICe 
how that could possibly be con-
strued as racist, because it's not 
looking at race." 

Associate Professor Winkfield 
Twyman of the California Western 
School of Law said the CCRI is 
"intellectually dishonest." He added 
that the initiative does not concern 
civil rights at all, and is merely a 
fearful, racist reaction to minority 
success. 

Speaken at the event asserted 
that, because racism and sexism per-
sist in society, minorities and women 
need affirmative action to achieve 
equal opportunities. 

"The attitude is that we don't

Cafe Audit 
MEmNCI: Council in limbo as 
representatives leave office and 
new students take over 
By Esther YOGA 
StIIfII Mtl'Iw 

After weeks of debate and indecision, sev-
eral A.S. members supported the 
administration's recommendation for an audit 
of the Che Cafe at last night's council meeting. 

According to A.S. Vice-President Adminis-
trative Jennifer Nicoll, it is within "the best 
financial and legal interest[s] of A.S." to en-
courage a S3,OOO audit, instead of proposals for 
a Icss-a>stly financial review of the Che. 

Several students protesting an audit of the 
Ch6 showed up at the A.S. meeting. The protest-
ors made a brief appearance and left after one 
representative expressed opposition to the audit 
for a few minutes . . 

The A.S. also discussed proposals for a re-
written Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
- the existing contract between A.S., the ad-
ministration and the Graduate Student ~ia­
tion (GSA) - and the inclusion ofthe Che Cafe 
as part of the Food Co-op, for liability purposes. 

Debate over the possibility of an audit is 
expected to reach closure with a final vote at 
next week's meeting.

Reclaimed Water Project Promises to Save UCSD $1 Million 
IRRI&AnON: 
Recycled water will be 
used for landscaping 
., ...... 
StIIfr Mer 

If a pending reclaimed-water 
project is approved by the summer 
of 19ln, UCSD would become the 
filii of numerous potential users to 
save It least $ 1 million on water 
allocated for irription. 

The Dew Iystem would cost 
UCSD 1_ than $2 for 748 plio .. 
of irriptio. water, compand with 

using regular city water, which cur-
rently costs $3 per 748 gallons. The 
reclaimed-water project - initiated 
by the San Diego Water Department 
- aims to decrease the cost of irri-
gation and reduce the amount of 
waste fIowina out to the ocean. 

The reclaimed water will be pro-
c:eaed It the North City Water Rec-
lamation Plant (NCWRP), a waste-
water treatment and reclamation fa-
cility DOW under c:onsaruc:tion east 
of 1-805. 

"Reclaimed water il water that

chemist for the City of San Diego 
Water Utilities Department. 

According to TM WtUer Loop 
- a newsletter on the co .. truction 
activities at NCWRP - the avenge

gallons of waste water each day. 
This waste water wiu be treated,

From July 1994 to JUDe 1995, the

approximately S2 million, ICCOId-

ing to Campus Utilities Coordinator 
Marty Vanryck of Physical Plant 
Services (pPS). Reclaimed water 
will reduce this cost tremendously.

According to Lucas, roughly .so

emphasized that the

however students 
are not allowed to 
get any books from

Lucas explained 
that any . student 
who wants to check 
out a book needs to 
inquire at the front

it for them.

According 10 Steve Kowalewsky, 
manager of the Oa:upational Health 
and Hygiene division of UCSD En-
vironmental Health cl Safety 
(EHclS), this shutdown is believed 
to be one of the major causes of the 

to restore the af-
fected books. 

Preservation Librarian Julie Page 
said that work has been performed 
on the library's air vents, ventila-
tion systems and ceiling tiles to pre-
vent the problem's recurrence. 

Page also Aid that most libraries 
face mold problems if the tempera-
ture is allowed to reach 70 degrees, 
and if the humidity rises to 70 per-
cent. For Ibis reason, all UCSD li-
braries are kept at 68 degrees. 

Low temperatures and good ven-
tilation will usually retard mold 
growth, Kowalewsky said. BHclS 
hopes the work done to the library 
will prevent future growths.

FORUM: 
Panelists defend 
affirmative action 
Continued from pac. l. 
need to give special preferences 
anymore," said panelist Maria 
Senour, a professor of education at 
San Diego State University (SDSU). 
"The m~ss!lge is that if you fail, it's 
because you're not trying hard 
enough." 

Other panelists agreed that affir-
mative action is necessary to protect 
minority representation. 

"We know that not all those who 
are opposed to affirmative action 
are racist, but some of them are," 
said George Mariscal , a UCSD pro-
fessor of Spanish literature. "We 
also know that our opponents' poli-
cies will have negative and racialized 
consequences in the future." 

Panelists, as well as audience 
members, frequently blamed racial 
strife on paranoid and misinformed 
affirmative-action dissenters, who 
are concerned that white men are 
being harmed by the preferences 
given to women and minorities. 

Shirley Weber, a professor of 
communications at SDSU, said the 
idea of reverse discrimination in the 
workplace and universities was 
"theoretically impossible," because 
white males still dominate manage-
rial positions in both areas. 

Weber also criticized a growing 
national movement to end affirma-
tive action. 

"If you have a pic, you cannot 
slice me off a piece of that pie, and 
then turn around and take it back 
saying, 'Oh no! I discriminated 
against myself,'" she said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Consideration: Professors Ling Chi Wang and Winkfield Twyman 
listen and respond to audience questions at Monday's teach-in. 

According to Weber, it is the 
responsibility of those claiming to 
be wronged by affirmative action to 
prove it. 

"Show meone white male who is 
wandering homeless in the street 
because of affirmative action," she 
said. "It is for those who are [seek-
ing to end affirmative action] to 
show us how we are hurting them." 

Senour alluded to the pressures 
felt by affirmative-action beneficia-
ries. "We are told that affirmative 
action lowers standards, and that we 
don 't belong here, .. she said. "When-
ever we make a mistake, we are 
afraid of reaffirming the stereotype." 

However, according to 
Steffensen, affirmative action in it-
self is racist, and it hurts the very 
people it was designed to help. 

"It's racist to divide people into 
groups and say they get special privi-
leges over others, just because of 

race," she said. "I think you should 
be judged on your merit, rather than 
by what group you're in, because 
that degrades a person." 

Students also sought to break 
down the misconception that only 
minorities support affirmative-ac-
tion programs, while all whites sup-
port CCRI. 

Many ofthe people behind CCRI 
are minorities, Steffensen said, "We 
aren't all white, as some people 
would suspect." 

Affirmative-action supporter 
Cassandra Johnson, a San Diego 
City College student, was asked if 
she felt she was being taken seri-
ously, because she was not part of a 
minority group. 

"I know what I believe in," said 
Johnson, the only Caucasian on the 
student panel. "I can '.I help what 
people think is going on in my head. 
All I can do is participate."

Atkinson Shows True Colors 
WIth Proposed Fee Hike 

uc President Richard Atkinson will begin his reign today 
by suggesting to the Board of Regents a.7.1 percent under-
graduate fee increase - which would raise undergraduate 
fees from $3,799 per year to $4,069: This will be Atkinson's 
first major policy recommendation since he took office Oct. 
2. While some people may have been shocked by this 
action, most UCSD students knew was only a matter of time 
before Atkinson showed his true colors. 

After all, Atkinson has never been known to take a stand 
on the behalf of students. His reputation lies in making 
money. When the regents selected Atkinson to. lead the UC 
systerfl, they were well aware of his past, and decided that 
money - not students - mattered. It is no surprise that 
Atkinson has cbosen to raise fees ratber than support or 
even address alternative ways to raise funds. 

The government bas determined tbat middle-class 
families do not need financial aid. However, the 
government's definition of whom is needy by no means 
reflects the middle-classes' bank. account. By supporting 
yet another fee increase, Atkinson threatens - as other UC 
presidents have in the past - the ability of money-strapped 
families to send their children to a UC school. 

Atkinson' s first action as president does not surprise us, 
for be has never taken our considerations to heart. However, 
we ask tbe Board of Regents to maintain the current fees, as 
they were able to this fall, for the first time in nine years. 
The price of a UC education is already unaffordable. Do not 
allow Atkinson to make it impossible to cover the cost. 

Million Man March Only 
Deepens the Racial Divide 

The last two weeks may have been the most racially 
tense period of the 19908. The Simpson verdict and the 
dismantling of affirmative-action policies have both pro-
voked reactions which clearly prove we are far from com-
bating racism in this country. This week, Louis Farrakahn, 
leader of the Nation of Islam, proposed his own solutions 
for ending black oppression in the United States. 

Calling upon African-American men to take more 
responsibility for their actions and for the country itself to 
atone for its sins against African Americans, Farrakhan led 
approximately 400,000 African-American men at the 
Million Man Marcb in Washington, D.C last Monday. 

Farrakhan's speech at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial 
did incite many to ponder the poor state of our race rela-
tions. However, the exclusive, segregated quality of tbe 
march proved that Farrakahn is hardly asking himself - or 
anyone else - to practice what he has preached. Such a 
separatist effort against racism only enlarges the divide 
between blacks and whites. 

In addition, we must ask ourselves why a man with such 
a racist past has become a major voice for the African-
American race. Farrakhan's old habit of calling Jews 
"bloodsuckers," and making other discriminatory remarks, 
is hardl.y conducive to acting responsibly. 

II cannot be denied that we need responsible leaders who 
can improve the race relations in our country. However, we 
should not look to men who have exhibited racist behavior 
to lead us in the fight against racism.

UCSD HIERARCHY LEAVES 
STUDENT PARKING IN COLD 

COMMENTARY: Despite spending $300 per year for a parking 
permit, students still can't park anywhere near their classes or abodes 
By Jonna Howden 
Contrlbutin, Opinion Writer 

I will spend approximately $6,000 this year on 
student fees. Such is the price of knowledge, and I 
accept that without much quibbling. In addition to 
the $6,000 for student fees, however, I will spend 
approximately $4,000 to live on campus. But since 
I must live somewhere, I accept that cost, as well. 

On top of the above-mentioned $10,000, I must 
buy a parking permit, which will cost $300 for the 
year - triple the cost of a parking permit at other 
UC schools. But since I must park, I grudgingly ac-
cept that fee. I will not accept, how-
ever, being told where I can park. 

I am a first-year student at 
:rhurgood Marshall College. I have 
paid my registration and housing 
fees, and have spent a thrifty $300 
for parking. I assumed, because I 
was paying to live and park on this 
campus, I could park where I lived 
- in the parking lot near the cenler 
of the Marshall apartments. 

only a student, I could not park there. I tried to ex-
plain to the man on the phone that he was mistaken. 
After all, I was the one paying $4000 to live in my 
apartment and an additional $300 to park next to it. 
Why shouldn't I be allowed to park in that lot? Of 
course, the friendly man on the phone could offer 
me no help. All he knew was that I could not to park 
there. 

According to the Residential Life Office, 550 
people live in the Marshall apartments. The lot where 
I parked is louted in the middle of the apartments 
and, if we were to follow common sense, would be 

designated for Thurgood Marshall 
apartment residents. Within this 
parking lot, however, there are only 
27 spaces for students, which means 
that less than two percent of the 
apartment po~ulation can park 
nearby. In thiJbme lot, there are 
over three times as many parking 
spaces for ~taff and faculty. 

So I did. 
Then one day, as I was casually 

walking to class, I noticed a slip of 
paper on my windshield. I proceeded 
toward my car, only to find a park-
ing ticket for an invalid permit. 

Now, I am not a complete idiot. I 
did notice the red and green squares 
on the corners of the parking spaces. 
That did signal some questions in my 
mind because I knew that student 
parking was yellow. 

But, you see, I did not even give 
those doubls a second thought. I 
knew this was the parking lot for my 
apartments, and I would not even let 
my mind consider the possibility that 
I was not allowed to park there. 
That's because such a possibility 
would crush all of my trust in the

The problem is not a physical lack 
of spaces; it is a lack of spaces des-
ignated for students. The staff and 
faculty spaces are located right next 
to housing facilities and lecture ~alls, 
while student spaces have been 
pushed to the outskirts of campus. 

All of this raises a question in my 
mind: If the whole purpose of our es-
teemed university - and higher edu-
cation in general - is to facilitate 
the learning ofstudents, why are their 
needs so overlooked in comparison 
to those of staff and faculty? The 
answer lies somewhere within the 
abatra«t terms of bureaucracy and 
IIristocracy. 

You see, this lillie parking di-
lemma is part of a much bigger prob-
lem. The official premise for the de-
velopment of the UC system was pre-
sumably education, and the system 

noble idea that society worked in a somewhat ratio-
nal manner. 

Infuriated, I decided to call the Parking and 
Transportation Department to discuss the rationale 
behind my ticket. What I discovered was frighten-
ing. I was told that the space in which I had parked 
is designated for staff and faculty and, because I was

There has emerged an aristocracy, a power class of 
the advantaged few, ruling the unfortunate many.

COMMENTARY: While rap music's lyrics may be offensive and crude, they are not 
responsible for the degradation, crime and poverty which amict this country's inner cities 

CENSORSHIP WON'T SOLVE SOCIETY'S WOES 
By K.vlta S.dan. . 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

A few years ago, I saw a movie 
called "The Godfather," ·ind I 
thought it was brilliant. Although 
I had the script practically memo-
rized, my parents weren't too wor-
ried because they Irusted that I 
wouldn't go around leaving dead 
fish on the doorsteps of my en-
emies. They knew that, despite my 
frequent and offensive recitation 
of some of my favorite scencs, it 
wasn't as if I were going to leav-
ing a horse's head on the bed of 
my most hated foe. That's be-
cause, as explicit as "The Godfa-
ther" was, it was just a movie, a 
harmless piece of entertainment· 
- and not a recipe for violCllce. 

Howeyer, the same cannot be 
said about another form of enter-
tainment : rap music. Amid the 
background of gangs, violence and 
abject poverty, inner-city youths 
are embracing this form of Menter-
tainment" and, in the process, in-
furiating others. Indeed, critics are 
growing increasingly upset over 
the surge of hard-core rap artists 
and their explicit music. And for 
good reasons. These days, rap 
music is littered with tales of vio-
lent beatings, insane shooting 
sprees and mass extermination of 

our police forccs. I n misogynistic 
fuhion, rappers also champion the 
degradation of women. Finally, 
and perhaps the saddeat of all, rap-
pers practice what they preach, 
setting a tragic example for inner-
city children to follow. 

Yet, as much as I may not like 
it, the use of "warning labels" -
a basic form of censorship - is 
not a legitimate solution. Rap mu-
sic is an art form; and censorship 
merely thwarts the Cllpreuion of 
a musician's anger and frustration, 
while ignoring the deeper issues 
involved. Bob Dole's recent tirade 
against the Hollywood establish-
ment is typical of overstepping 
artistic boundaries, of silencing 
alternative viewpoints and encour-
aging other Americans to join in. 
Censorship is only a patchwork 
solution - at best - to the more 
serious problems plaguing our so-
ciety. 

Americans are angered about 
the level of violence in rap music, 
feeling the only choice is to cen-
sor it altogether. This is not a sur-
prising reaction, considering the 
horrible depictions of violence 
against groups such as the police. 
If officers don't look like complete 
idiots in some songs - being out-
witted by "gangstas" - they are

simply, killed in others, ulually by 
the rap musician and his posse. 

Yet despite the method of de-
livery, these' are the emotional 
outcryingl of rap musicians, and 
- as legitimate forms of social 
expression - they should be pro-
tected. Cutting lyrics which co~-

tain references to violence against 
policemen still docs not solve the 
problem: Police officers are noto-
rious for unnecessary violence 
against African Americans, who 
mayor may not have committed 
any wrongdoings. Censorship, 
then, becomes a quick and ineffec-
tive "solution" to the problem. 

As for the degradation of 
women, rap musicians need to se-
riously step out of tbe dark ages 
and into 1995:.stepping into the 
year 1795 would even be an ad-

o vancement. I admit, I do get scared 
when I hear nine-year-old kids 
usert how women are just patches 
of dirt to walk over. Perhaps kids 
believe this because Dr. Ore and 
Ice Cube have repeatedly stressed 
how women only serve to please 
them sexually and to be kicked 
around. Snoop Doggy 0081, the 
ultimate role model, assesses that 
"Bitches ain't shit but hos and 
tricks, nibble on nuts and suck 
their dicks." 

Could these derogatory views 
possibly result from the family 
decay brought about in the ghet-
tOI, where masculine bravado is 
posed on to successive genera-
tions? Quite probably. But censor-
ship would only silence the ex-
pressed thoughts of musical enter-

taioers, without attempting to end 
the familial erosion. 

In spite of all this controversy, 
rap music is, sadly, very popular. 
Children of the ghettos (and of the 
suburbs) look up to rappers, em-
bracing their gun-toting, women-
hating dogma. It is time for artists 
to realize tbat a lack of commu-
nity involvement condemns the 
next generation in the ghettos to 
the same harsh re.lity tbey have 
faced. Rap musicians could use 
their power anj! influence to aid 
the community from which they 
originated, helping the disadvan-
taged youth of America reach their. 
full potential. Instead, more often 
than not, they practice what they 
preach. 

But, again, despite its violence, 
its attacks on women and its nega-
tive influence, rap music docs oot 
deserve to be censored. Strangely, 
my opinion on rap didn't truly 
evolve until Bob Dole made his 
now-famous Hollywood speecb. 
His opinions on rap music upset 
me, opening my eyes to my own 
ignorance. He blamed tbe big 
companies which backed these 
artists for deluging the country 
with "nightmares of depravity." 
After stating thaI this country's

PARK: Lots too 
far from classes to 
justify $300 permits 
ContInued from PICe 4 
Coupled with this power are spe-
cial perks and benefits. One of the 
perks had by the aristocracy here 
at UCSD - staff and faculty - is 
parking closer than students to 
classroom buildings and housing 
complexes. Our administration is 
more concerned with assuaging 
the professors than satisfying the 
legitimate needs of students. 

But the apparent aristocracy at 
. UCSD is not even as bad as the 

obvious bureaucracy. Bureaucracy 
is supposed to be about federal and 
state employees helping execute 
each other's policies. Unfortu-
nately, this system has turned into 
an overabundance of public ser-
vants, each lacking in the desire 
to serve the public. And sadly, the 
bureaucracy of the U.S. govern-
ment has found its way into the UC 
syite"", forcing students to wait in 
huge lines to pay $300 for a per-
mit which is only valid a mile from 
where they live. 

RAP: Censoring

Continued from PICe 5

There are obviously some dis-
tinct and tro'ubling problems with 
the parking situation at UCSD. 
Now, the question is what to do 
about it. The university should re-
allocate the parking spaces around 
housing facilities to those who live 
there. Another suggestion is to re-
move the meters, giving those 
parki ng spaces to students. I seri-
0us�y doubt the regents would go . 
broke without this revenue. 

If no change occurs in the lo-
cation and allocation of parking 

spac~s, then the cost of parking 
permits should be decreased to 
equal their worth. 

Something needs to be done 
and if the UCSD Parking and 
Transportation Department does 
not take action, then students 
should. If we allow this school to 
treat us in an unacceptable man-
ner, soon we will fail to recognize 
the injustice. 

When that happens, it will be-
come easier and easier for the 
school to take away our rights. 
And what may be even more 
frightening, is the apathy creeping 
into our hearts during the whole 
process.

However, after Dole's speech, 

a June 1995 Time magazine poll in-
dicated that Americans were very 
concerned about the violence on

on television shows and music.

SIMPSON TRIAL CONTINUES 
Editor: 

The OJ. Simpson trial exposed 
two major problems with our legal 
system. The first is the potential COlI· 
flict between justice and a lawyer's 
ethics. [)dense lawyenueobligaled 
to do their best to obcain an acquittal 
if the client WIllIs it, rather than to 
ensu~ that justice is mdIed. An at· 
torney may know his client is guilty, 
but if the attorney can damage the 
prosecution's argument, then the 
conflict between a lawyer's oath and 
justice becomes evident. 

Bastardizing facts, convoluting 
logic, shifting the trial's focus and 
enhancing racial divisions all be-
come commonplace. If the client 
is guilty, the ends cannot justify the 
means. But if the defendant is in-
nocent, the acquittal may justify 
the defense's strategy and tactics. 

The second problem exposed by 
the trial was the potential conflict 
between the pursuit of justice and 
police ethics. The Los Angeles Po-
lice Department may have planted 
evidence, not to frame Simpson, but 
rather to bolster the case against him. 

on television before he finishes el-
ementary school. Dole, while not 
directly advocating censorship, ne-
glects to address one of the true 
causes o.f modem violence: the de-
terioration of urban, socioeconomic 
stability. 

I am also disappointed to lcam that 
nearly 83 percent of Americans favor 
warning labels on records. While many 
musicians, movies and television shows 
arc explicit, art should be held to no 
other standard than the powerfulness of

Students Ganter Grants 
McNAIR: Federal 
program will aid 30 
juniors and seniors 
By Suunne Ph ... 
Guardian Reporter 

Thirty UCSD juniors and seniors 
will be given $2,400 each to pursue 
graduate studies, as a result of a four-
year, $775,529 grant recently awarded 
to UCSD by the U.S. Departmentbf 
Education. The grant is part of the 
Robert E. McNair Polil-baccalaureate 
Achievemenl Program_ 

To be selected for the program, 
students must be the first genewtion 
in their families to receive doctoral 
degrees, as weU as come from low-
income backgrounds. Two-thirds of 
the scholars pickedwiU havetheabove 
qualificatiolti, while the remainder 
will include groups underrepresented 
in graduate schools. 

"The McNair program ... encour-
ages those underrepresented to pur-
sue PhDs," said Tammy Parsons, an 
assistant with the UCSD Academic 
Enrichment Program. 

are working with groups who tradi-
tionally do not apply," said Parsons . 
"Many of them haven ' t even heard 
of graduate school." 

As part of the program, students 
will have the opportunity to do year-
long research with a faculty mentor, 
and full-time research for 8 weeks 
during the summer. 

"From the student's point of 
view, this would be a definite ben-
efit, given the full intensive year of 
academic preparation," said Sandra 
C. Kripalani, coordinator of the 
McNair Program. 

Students are getting twice the 
support, iccording to biology pro-
fessor Melvin H. Green, director of 
the Academic Enrichment Program, 
which administers the UCSD 
McNair program. 

"When you're dealing with low-
income students ... any assistance 
can 'help," Green said. "Our pro-
gram assists them in an educational 
and financial way."

The McNair program was named 
in honor of the African-American 
physicist and astronaut, Dr. Ronald 
E. McNair, who died in the '1986 
Challenger space-shuttle accidenl. 

This will be the third time UCSD 
has received the McNair grant since 
becoming one of the original 14 
schools to receive the award in 1989. 
Since the program has been renewed 
this year, the program has changed 
from a summer-long program to a 
year-round one. The four-year grant 
will be distribuled to UCSD at 
$190,000 a year.

The Addiction Takes on 
Philosophical Issues 

Director Abel Ferraras vampirefilm 
falls just shy of pretention 

By Dan Okada 
Guardian Reporter 

In the confrontational spirit of his previous 
projects, director Abel Ferrara challenges his 
audience once again with The Addiclion , a con-
founding tale of vampires and the human fasci-
nation with evil. 

Set on the streets of New York City, the 
black-and-white film instantly sets its tone and 
mood with footage from the trag-
edy of My Lai in Vietnam, shown 
during a philosophy class at NYU. 
Kathleen Conklin (Lili Taylor), a 
graduate student on the verge of 
receiving her diploma, contem-
plates a world which allows hor-
rorssuch as My Lai and Dachau to 
occur. On her way home from class 
one night, a mysterious woman 
(Annabella Sciorra) attacks 
Kathleen, demanding that she com-
mand her to leave. Kathleen's meek response 
fails to satisfy the woman, who proceeds to bite 
her on the neck, leaving Kathleen stunned and 
bleeding in a darkened, trash-strewn ally. I n the 
aftermath of the attack - and stricken by a 
strange infection - Kathleen is gradually com-
pelled by vampirical appetites to seek prey upon 
which to feed. With each victim, the hunger 
inside continues to grow at the expense of her 
humanity, consuming her with evil. 

Taylor produces a convincing portrayal of a 

grad student in the process of questioning her-
self and all she has learned throughout her life. 
She does a good job displayi~g Kathleen's 
graduaitransformation following heraltack. By 
the time she is completely consumed by her 
blood lust, Kathleen has abandoned her human-
ity and become a ruthless murderer. 

Christopller Walken turns in an excellent, 
although brief, performance as Peina, an elder 

vampire who has found an inner 
peace, all but conquering his urges 
to feed. Pei na tries to teach Kathleen 
ofapath toconquerthebeastwithin, 
almost killingher in the process. He 
underestimates her, eventually al-
lowing her to escape, after which 
she immediately reverts to her 
vampiric ways. 

Although The Addiction makes 
heavy use of vampirism within the 
story, it is not a typical vampire 

film. The heart of the movie lies in the philo-
sophical guegions and issues it raises. Many 
aspects of The Addiction are metaphorical rep-
resentationsofthe mclinationsofhumanity. 
Unfortunately, while an emphasis oli philuso-
phy places it apart from previous films in the 
vampire genre, it may also alienate many view-
ers. The issues come dangerously close to mak-
ing the film pretentious. 

TheAddiclion opens tomorrow at the Hillcrest 
Cinemas. .

John Travolta Shows 
His Comic Talent 

Get ~l)orty parodies film industry 
By Michelle Kessler 
Guardian Reporter 

With a well·written script, likable 
supporling perfor-
mances and John 
Travolla in a black 
leather jacket, GelShorty 
is an entertaining film, a 
successful parody of the 
motion-picture industry. 

Travolta stars as Chili 
Palmer, a smooth-talk-
ing loan shark and gang-
ster. The film opens with 
Palmer going to Las Ve-
gas in search of an elusive dry cleaner, 
who faked his own death in an airline 
crash to avoid paying his debts. 
Palmer's bosses expect payment of 
some sort, and they don't mind if he 
has to break a few limbs to get it After 

the dry-cleaner debacle, Palmer's 
bosses send him to Los Angeles to 
collect a debt from unsuccessful film 

producer Harry Zimm 
(Gene Hackman). Zimm 
borrowed money to make 
an Oscar-</ualily picture, 
but his previous films-
such as Swamp Thing III 
- suggest his chances of 
success are slim. 

In Hollywood, Palmer 
becomes swept-up in the 
mystique of the motion-
picture industry. Whcnhe 

actually meets up with Zimm,. rather 
than killing him, Palmer pitches an 
idea for a film. Palmer's script -
about a dry cleaner who fakes his own 
death - thrills Zimm, and the two 
form an uneasy alliance. They try to

AClDe 
Ballbreaker 

EastWeat Recorda 

In order to appeal to '90s hard-
rock fans, bands such as Van 
Halen and Guns 'n' Roses have 
sacrificed their raunchy roots for 
a more tame, overproduced 
sound. 

One band which 
has refused to give up 
its raw edge is ACI 
DC. The arrival of 
Rick Rubin - the pro-
ducer famous for re-
storing numerous 
bands' purity - along 
with the return of 
former drummer Phil 
"Left Hook" Rudd, re-
sults in Ballbrealcer, a 
record that is true to form at the 
expense of originality. 

The band 's classic riffs and 
sexually cbarged lyrics are best 
accompanied by a six-pack (or 
two) and a crowd. In fact, songs 
such as "Hard as a Rock, " " Love 
Bomb" and "Caught With Your 

Pants Down" not so subtly cap-
ture the essence of the record. In 
its press release; the group 
proudly states that a professional 
stripper once bragged that she 
"danced" only 10 the band's mu-

sic. 
Ballbrealcer might 

occasionally be mis-
taken for one of the 
group's late '70s tours 
de force, but it shows, 
for the most part, that 
the band's sound isn't 
nearly as exciting as it 
was originally. 

However, a true 
AC/DC fan can still 

expect the unvarnished bravado, 
selfless hooks and the chops of 
original guitarist Angus Youpg 
- all of which has become the 
Aussie's 'trademark. As far as 
AC/DC -is concerned, if it ain't 
broke, don't fix it.

311 Super-
suckers 311 

In many cases, a band can only 
achieve widespread success by en-
tering the mainstream. On its latest 
release, Nebras1ca's 311 sacriftceS 
most of the gritty edge first its a1-
bum,Music, which came out in 1993. 
Not only has the group 
mellowed its sound to 
reach a wider audience 
(the band proudly an-
nounces that its latest 
video is getting heavy 
rotation on M1V), but 
311 's new material is 
about as ongi nal as its 
self-titled record. 

Mixing riff-laden 
metal with a rap deliv-
ery, the band rants aboul drug use on 
"Misdirected Hostility," with lead-
singer Nicholas Hexum declaring 
that"ln 1989, I was cocaine and Jim 
Beam! But now its '95 and I'm Gin-
seng. " The group pJso tries to tackle 
handgun yiolenceon "Guns (Are for 
Pussies)," bul without much suc-

cess, as the message gets lost amid 
lyricsfocusingontheband'stroub1es 
adjusting to the "big city." 

The band takes pride on its up-
heat outlook on life, buttheresulting 
sound is almost devoid of the rage 

and pain which charac-
terize the music of 
today's most powerful 
rock or rap acts. The me-
chanical delivery of 
Hexum and OJ SA 
Martinez don't help 311 
either. 

When Hexum sings 
"I'm not from PhilIy, but 
somesay l'mblunt/1bat's 
just the way I am, and no 

I'm not going to front," it sounds like a 
forced rhyme. Maybe that'sjust what it 
lakes to get on MIV. 

311 will perform with the Phunk 
Junkeez, 1000 Mona Lisas, Mr. 
Mirainga and Incubus at 8 p.m. to-
day at SOMA Live.

Sacrilicious 
Sub Pop Recorda 

Drawing equally from Lynyrd 
Skynyrd, Cheap Trick and the 
Sex Pistols, the Supersuckers ir-
reverently combine musical 
styles on their latest album, 
Sacrilicious. The band's lone-
some bar ballad "Don't Go Blue" 
is pure country, while the flashy 
guitar solos in "My Victim" re-
veal the blatant influence of '70s 
rock. 

The absence of guitarist Ron 
Heathman doesn't hurt the Se-
attle-based band one bit, as new 
guitarist Rick Sims - formerly 
of the Didjits - provides fantas-
tic, Southern-fried licks. 

The Supersuckers wiU perform 
an all-ages show with Tenderloin 
and Swivelneck at 8 p.m. on Fri-
day at SOMA Live.

18 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Tritons Ride Stags, 3-0 
PLAYOFF BOUND?: UCSD improved its chances by beating Claremont 
By Ie.n R.hlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

A road game versus intense ri-
val, Claremont College. Traveling 
on the road in the middle of mid-

"We came out and dominated 
from the start," senior defender Ken 
Bumssaid. "We didn 't letthecrowd 
get into it the whole night. We scored 
early and kept the ball the rest of the 
night, so they didn ' t have chance to 
get going." . 

- assisted by Alex Glebov - giv-
ing the Tritons a 2-0 lead. Mike 
Hamilton rounded out the scoring at 
3-0, with only four minutes left. 
Hamilton's first goal of the season 
was assisted by Shane Ferber. 

Thursday: October 19, 1995 

Mark Pattersonl Guanlian 

terms week, with 
heckling fans and an 
unfriendly field. This 
should add up to ' a 
tough match for a vis-
iting UCSD men 's 
soccer team, right? 

Throughout the rest of the first 
half, UCSD kept possession of the 
ball, denying every attempt by the 
Stags to score. In fact, Claremont 
only mustered four shots during the 
entire game, while the Tritons fired 
14 attempts toward the Claremont 
goalkeeper. 

"In the past, we've gotten up one 
goal and haven't gotten that second 
goal," junior Nate Hetherington said. 
"Sooner or later, the other team will 
get a goal, so in the past few games 
we've worked on getting the second 
and third goals to put [the opposi-
tion] away." 

Scorln, frenzy: UCSO's Carrie Peer (17) watche~ along with a 
throng of Athena players, as yet another Triton goal sails in. 

Nope. All those 
external factors 

turned out to be insignificant for the 
Tritons, as they rolled over 
Oaremonton Wednesday ,3-0. With 
the win, UCSD improved to 8-4-2 
-and solidified its post-season hopes. 

UCSD roared out of the gate, 
hoping to quiet the crowd and take 
control of the game early. Jose' 
Ocampo came Ihrough in the clutch 
for Ihe Tritons, scoring an unas-
sisted goal at the 12: 15 mark in the 
first half. 

The second half mirrored the first, 
with UCSD controlling possession 
and forcing the Stags to chase the 

. ball all around the field. As the clock 
wound down, Claremont made its 
last attempt to tie the game by bring-
ing its defenders and midfielders 
up, but UCSD was not about to give 
the contest away. 

At the 82:00 mark, Joel Kosakoff 
scored the second goal of the game

UCSD will host Concordia Col-

Tritons will probably earn a playoff 
spot. 

"We played very well, and it's a 
great result," Triton Head Coach 
Derek Armstrong said. "We were 
always in charge of the game. Al-
ways in charge. Now we've got one 
game to win, and Ilhink we'll get in

Claremont], and we need to see if

The remainder of UCSD's 
schedule is filled with tough, 
"must-win" coniests. Division III 
rivals UCSC and Occidental com-
prise the next two obstacles, fol-
lowed by CSU-Dominguez Hills 
and CSU-San Bernardino. 

"We are looking forward to 
playing [CSUSB] again," junior 
Brandie Hayungs said. "We lost to 
them at San Bernardi no last time, 
and this is a chance to redeem 
ourselves."

Continued from pal. 20 

Game two was an equally domi-
nating performance by the UCSD 
team, which ransacked the Regal's 
defense to the tune of a 15-6 victory 
and a 2-0 lead. A key to the perfor-
mance of the Tritons was a player 
move which put freshman middle 
blocker Christine Prowd at the "op-
posite" position, usually filled by 
the injured Madelyn Ripken. That 
move left an imposing front line of 
junior Christine Chi, Noonan and 
Prowd to patrol the nets. 

The result: The Tritons 
outblocked Cal Lutheran, 19-9, and 
dominated the net play. Game three 
was further evidence, as UCSD held 
off a desperate Regal squad to take 
the match in straight sets, 15-13_ 

"This is the first time this year 
that we actually finished a team in 
three," Noonan said. "This whole 
year we've been taking a lot of teams 
to four or five when it was really 
unnecessary to drag it on that long. " 

"It's the first time all season that 
we've played like a championship 
team," Dannevik said. "We looked 
bigger, stronger and more athletic. 
We did all the things we needed to 
do. It was huge to prove to ourselves 
that we could play that well."

DANKRAFr 

How MuchIsa 
Streak Worth? 

IlSk you, bas there been 
anything more spectacular in 
the world of sports this past 
year than Cal Ripken, Jr. 's 
punuit of a record many felt 
would never fall? Despite the 
naysayers, Ripken doggedly 
cbued the mark for most 
consecutive games played. 

Athenas Bow To mgher God 
THEY'RE BAUCK: UCSD slammed Oaremont 
College, 8-0, on Monday to halt a two-game skid 

Ripken WIS rarely, if ever, 
slowed by the usual bumps and 
bruises of a pro athelete, and 
absolutely nothing confined 
him to the bench during the 
course of an amazing 2,131 
straight games. He set the 
RlCOrd in front of thousands of 
fans in his home park of 
Camden Yards. The Baltimore 
stadium - designed in the 
traditional style, with ivy 
covered brick walls and a 
manual scoreboard - was a 
fitting house in which to salute 
Ripken, whose longevity was a 
throwback to the days of yore. 

The 15-minute standing 
ovation, tfie multiple curtain 
calls and his trot around the 
stadium will forever be etched 
in the memories of baseball 
fans everywhere. It was the 
single biggest step toward 
restoring the old magic to the 
game, after the strike threat-
ened to destroy it. 

Just this past week, 
however, Ripken committed a 
sin so grievous that it made his 
Herculean feat pale in com-
parison to the glow of its 
absurdity. Yes, my hero and 
yours, Cal Ripken, Jr., allowed 
his accomplishment to be co-
opted to sell ... trucks! 

But not just any trucks, 
mind you. His famous 
demeanor has been plastered 
across America as part of an ad 
campaign for Chevrolet, set to 
the memorable theme song, 
"Like aRock." Admittedly, 
Ripken is the perfect symbol to 
represent this catchy tune. 
And, without a doubt, the man 
responsible for concocting this 
campaign - and getting Cal's 
autograph on the appropriate 
contracts - is presently 
adjusting to the feel of his new 
20th-floor office. 

My simple question is: 

By D_KnIII 
. sports Editor 

After an unprecedented two 
straight losses, the UCSD women's 
soc:cer team WIS primed for an ex-
plosion. On Monday night, 

Claremont College 
acted as the detona-
tor. UCSD slammed 
the Athenas, 8-0, 
leaving no doubt IS 
to its ability to put 
points on the board. 

The game was 
dominated by the 

speedy Triton team, and the scoring 
chances came early and often. A 
mere 4:51 into the game, UCSD 
notched its first goal. Amanda 
Johnson stole an errant Claremont 
pass and drove down the right side 
before launching a centering. P.'S5' 
Carrie Peer beat a defender" the 
ball on the receiving end and sent a 
careening shot into the top-right cor-
ner of the net. 

Less than two minutes later, the 

Tritons struck again, when a per-
fectly placed comerkick by Lauren 
Johnson was headed off the cross 
bar and in by Beth Freeburg. 

Amanda Johnson made it 3-0 nine 
minutes later. She collected a loose 
ball 10 yards above the goalie box, 
and bllSted a right-footed shot to-
ward the lower-left comer. Athena 
keeper Kathryn Gafney-whospent 
most of the night scrambling after 
UCSD shots-WIS unable to knock 
this one away. 

Head Coach Brian McManus at-
tributed UCSD's roaring start to an 
attitude adjustment, which took 
place after a loss to Westmont lISt 
weekend. 

"The girls sat in the locker room 
for about an hour after the Westmont 
game and had a meeting," McManus 
said. "And the attitude that they 
came out with here against 
Claremont showed." 

It took UCSD exactly 12 sec-
onds of the second half to drive 
down the heart of the defense, cap-
ping that effort with a looping shot 
into ' the top-right comer by junior 
Ele Johnson. 

Johnson waited 12 minutes be-
fore striking 
again, this time on 
a feed from fellow 
speed-demon, 
Carin Pugh. Pugh 
stole a weak goal-
kick and fed 
Johnson in the 
center of the 18-

yard box. Johnson quickly fired a 
ball through the mass of legs in front 
of the goal and into the left comer 
for UCSD's fifth score. 

Mark Plltteraon/Gulnllltl 

Speed Idl .. : UCSD's Carin Pugh (left) races to control a ball during 
the Tritons 8-0 thrashing of Claremont College on Monday night. 

With a firm grip on the game, the 
Tritons decided to take a break from 
scoring goals. Unfortunately for 
Claremont, UCSD quickly tired of 
the strategy and regained its offen-
sive furror at the 83-minute mark. 
Defender Diana Muchowski ven-
tured upfield and got her head on a 
Lauren Johnson free kick, which 
continued into the net for a goal. 

Pugh followed that tally with one 

of her own - a scant 2S seconds 
later - when she scooted down the 
right side and cranked a shot back 
across to the left corner. 

The crowning goal occurred one 
minute later, when Muchowski once 
again found her way into the 
Athenas' goalie box. This time, she 
got off a left-footed blast into the 
top of the net, before being tackled

Revenge is Sweet 
ON TOP AGAIN: UCSD returned to its customary position atop the 
West Region with a three set demolition of the West's #1, Cal Lu 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

You wouldn't know it by its record, but the 
UCSD women's volleyball team (11-9) is feeling 
primed and ready for the playoffs. 

After an up-and-down season where 
the Tritons were plagued by injuries, they 
got a sign that it may all come together 
when it counts most. That sign was a key 
road victory over arch rival - and the 
nation's number-four ranked team-Cali-
fornia Lutheran (16-2). 

The biggest difference in the contest 
maY'have been instilled in the UCSD team 
members before the match began. The Tritons 
underwent a change in their outlook, brought on 

"[DannevikJ told us to go out there like we 
were the better team," freshman Shannon Noonan 
said. "Last time, when they were at our home, we 
didn't have that mentality. We thought we were 
the better team. We just had to act like it." 

The Tritons did much more tban act 
like it; they played like it. The Regals' 
home court advantage was silenced before 
it could assert itself, as the UCSD squad 
came out fired up, reeling off 12 of the first 
13 points to take a commanding lead. Al-
though Cal Lu attempted a comeback, the 
Tritons did not relinquish their death-grip 
on the game, IS they won, IS-9. 

Why, C"i? Why reduce a feat 
so great to the level of a 
vehicle so ••• average. If he had 
signed with Rolls Royce or 
Ferrari, I would see the 
connection, but Chevrolet? If 
the incompanble Ripken 
would stoop so low, I can only 
shake my bead in wonderment 
at the levels to which other 
great men might sink. 

GIMt ..-: Mleke Blesheuvel led the way by their own displeasure with their play and by 
with 12 kills In UCSO's win over .4 Cal Lu. Head Coach Doug Danaevik. 

"That opening game set the tone for the whole 
match, .. Danaevik said. "We were very cntbusiu-
tic, we were louder and we really came to play."
