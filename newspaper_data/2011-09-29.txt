    Ten of the “Irvine 11” students were 
found guilty of two misdemeanor 
charges for disrupting Israeli Ambas-
sador Michael Oren’s speech at UC 
Irvine in February 2010. �e students 
will serve three years of probation 
and 56 hours of community service 
based on charges of  disrupting a law-
ful assembly and conspiring to com-
mit said crime. �e 11th student, Ha-
kim Kebir, accepted a plea bargain for 
40 hours of community service earlier 
this year. 
    �e Irvine 11 initially faced the 
possibility of a year in jail for their 
actions. During the scheduled speech 
on U.S.-Israeli relations, the eleven 
shouted various insults such as “Mi-
chael Oren, you are a war criminal” 
and “Murder is not free speech.” 
   �e Orange County jury reached 
their verdict last Friday a�er a 
couple of days of deliberation. 
    According to defense attorney Dan 
Stormer, his team is currently working 
on appealing the verdict to address 
the charge of “the disturbing of an as-

UC Regent David Crane — appointed by for-mer Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in December 2010 
 — is unlikely to continue his term 
as a regent after the end of this year.

In order to be a confirmed mem-
ber of the UC Regents Board — a 
member that is allowed to continue 
for the entirety of the three-year 
UC Regent term — the state Senate 
needs to vote for his confirmation 
before the end of this year. 

The state Senate is not scheduled 
to meet again until Jan. 4, eight days 
after Crane’s Dec. 27 deadline. This 
means that in order for the Senate 
to make a decision regarding Crane, 
they would need to be brought back 
into session in order to formally call 
a last-minute meeting with Crane’s 
status on the voting agenda.

“By not acting one way or the 
other on confirmation, the state 
Senate ensured that he could serve as 
a regent for the entire year,” UCOP 
Media Relations Director Steve 
Montiel said in an email. “Unless 
the state Senate comes back into ses-
sion and confirms his appointment, 
Regent Crane would continue to 
serve beyond December 2011 only 

if he were re-appointed by Governor 
Brown.”

Even though it is only through 
the Senate’s lack of action that Crane 
may lose his position, some student 
leaders see Crane’s lack of confirma-
tion as a benefit to the UC system.

“Californians are sick and tired 
of not being adequately represent-
ed by UC’s regents,” UC Students 
Association (UCSA) President 
Claudia Magana wrote in a Sept. 15 
statement. “We need leaders who 
will represent our interests and fight 
to keep our UC public and afford-
able, not out of touch millionaires 
and investment bankers who are 
beholden more to Wall Street than 
to everyday Californians.”

Crane, however, believes his 
position and voice as a UC Regent 
has been beneficial to students.

“What I bring is [the voice of] the 
boy who noticed that the emperor 
has no clothes,” he said. “Tuition has 
tripled in the last three years, and for 
middle-class families with dreams of 
getting their child a higher educa-
tion, it’s just brutal.”

Even in his likely absence, Crane

The Federal Transit Administration 
approved the proposal for the extension 
of the Old Town Trolley that will run 
through UCSD, making it officially eligible 
to receive federal funding. Completion is 
set for 2015.

The Mid-Coast Corridor Transit would 
run 11 miles from Old Town Transit 
Center to UCSD and Westfield University 
Town Center. There will be eight sta-
tions along the route, with stops planned 
at Tecolote Drive, Clairemont Drive and 
Balboa Avenue. The stops close to UCSD 
are at Gilman Drive, Nobel Drive, a stop 
on-campus around Price Center, Genesee 
Avenue and UTC.

The trolley extension costs $1.2 billion. 
Local officials hope for half of the funding 
to come from TransNet, a local half-cent 
sales tax for transportation passed in 2008. 
They hoped that they could receive federal 
funding for the remainder, something they 
are now eligible for.

UCSD athletics placed No. 6 
overall — up from last year’s No. 23 
ranking — by the National Collegiate 
Scouting Association (NCSA), fin-
ishing behind NCAA Division I No. 
5 University of Notre Dame and 
No. 4 Stanford University.  The uni-
versity was named the top NCAA 
Division II institution in the country 
by the NCSA, in its Collegiate Power 
Rankings released on Sept. 20. 

This marks the campus’ seventh 
year making NCSA’s top 100 cam-

puses. Every university is eligible 
for the top 100 — the Collegiate 
Power Rankings are calculated for 
each university. NCSA takes into 
account student-athlete graduation 
rates and academic rankings, pro-
vided by the U.S. News & World 
Report. Strength of athletic depart-
ments are taken from the Learfield 
Sports Directors’ Cup rankings. Last 
year, the Learfield Sports Directors’ 
Cup ranked UCSD as the fifth best 
overall athletic department out of 
300 schools. UCSD first made the 
top 100 list in 2005, placing No. 26 
overall. The university has earned 

the top position in Division II five 
years in a row. 

According to “Survey Ranks 
UCSD as Top NCAA Division II 
Program,” published Sept. 20 in the 
La Jolla Patch, less than six percent of 
colleges and universities make it to 
NCSA’s top 100 list. 

“We are very pleased to [be] 
ranked among the top universities 
in the country,” UCSD Director of 
Athletics Earl Edwards told La Jolla 
Patch. “We pride ourselves on excel-
ling both academically and athleti-
cally and it’s great to be recognized 
for our accomplishments in both of 

those areas. Being ranked as the No. 
1 institution in Division II is some-
thing we’re extremely proud of, but I 
feel our overall ranking is even more 
significant.”

NCSA’s annual study is designed 
to aid student-athletes in the process 
of selecting a college. UCSD athlet-
ics — which moved from Division 
III to Division II in 2000 — boasts 30 
National Championships, just a frac-
tion of 194 total national, regional 
and conference championships.

UCÊScientistsÊDiscoverÊYoungestÊTypeÊof ÊSupernova
By Rebecca Horwitz
Associate News Editor 

Ever woken up to a bright 
light? Imagine that multiplied by 
millions and you’ve got a super-
nova. In early September, UCSD 
researchers located a supernova — 
a dying star that unleashes a burst 
of light — just as it was exploding.

UC Berkeley Astronomer 
Joshua Bloom said that there has 
not been a supernova this close 
in over thirty years. He called it 
the “supernova of a generation” in 
an interview on Sept. 13 for NBC 
San Diego. 

UCSD’s High-Performance 
Wireless and Research Education 
Network used technology in the 
San Diego Supercomputer Center 
to transfer high-volume data in 
real time to facilities miles away. 
The technology helped research-
ers at the San Diego Palomar 
Observatory discover the super-
nova’s coordinates early, giving 
observation access to hundreds of 
amateur astronomers. They used a 
Palomar 48-inch Oschin Schmidt 

telescope from the observatory to 
digitally survey a large portion of 
the sky every night. 

HPWREN Director Hans-
Werner Braun said the HPWREN 
was a piece of cyberinfrastructure 
that was essential for the discovery 
of the supernova. Braun stressed 
that the discovery was a collabora-
tive process — astronomers from 
UC Berkeley were also involved. 

“The key were people, par-
ticularly researchers who make 
things happen,” Braun said in an 
email. “They are stronger and far 
more effective when they utilize 
key technologies.”

The scientist who first noted 
the supernova was Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory Staff Scientist 
Peter Nugent. Nugent runs a sub-
traction of the Palomar Transient 
Factory at the National Energy 
Research Scientific Computing 
Center at Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory. Part of his job is to 
search for potential supernova 
candidates in the laboratory’s 
database based on pictures from 
the telescope. His search for the 

best candidate in a known nearby 
galaxy yielded a supernova in the 
Pinwheel galaxy.

Nugent then asked Oxford 
Astrophysics Member Mark 
Sullivan for a spectrum – the dif-
ferent colors of light that come 
from a star – of the supernova’s 
components. The spectrum would 
allow them to scatter the light 
and determine the elements in 
the atmosphere of the supernova. 
That was when they realized they 
were dealing with a type 1a super-
nova — a white dwarf star’s ther-
monuclear explosion. Not only is 
it rare to find a supernova in this 
young stage — this is actually the 
youngest type 1a supernova ever 
seen.

The reality of Nugent’s discov-
ery has not yet hit him. 

“For now I think the very 
best part about it is how I have 
been able to show my family this 
discovery in our little telescope,” 
Nugent said in an email. “This has 
been very cool.”

Due to the technology used at 
the San Diego Computer Center, 

thousands of people have been 
able to look at the supernova.

“It’s well within the reach of 
ordinary [people] which makes it 
quite special,” Bloom said. “This is 
the kind of supernova that people 
who study supernovas on a regu-
lar basis are all they get basically 
once in a lifetime.”

Supernovas help scientists 
understand how some stars die. 
Scientists can use their brightness 
to measure distance in astrono-
my and discover more informa-
tion about the star, including the 
temperature and elements in the 
atmosphere. The supernova that 
is currently being studied is a 
rare opportunity in the world of 
astronomy. Bloom said that near-
by supernovas allow scientists to 
study their “exquisite details.”

“Observing the [supernova] 
unfold should be a wild ride,” 
Nugent said in a statement 
released to NBC San Diego Sept. 
13. “It is an instant cosmic classic.”

is covered under the �rst amendment. 
   “We intend to �ght this on the 
grounds that the penal code [§ 403] 
is unconstitutional,” Stormer said.  
    In addition to increasing political 
tension, the case sparked a national 
debate on the interpretation of free 
speech rights. Some agree with the 
jury’s decision, but there are also those 
who concur with the defense that 
the law against assembly disruption 
contradicts the right to free speech.  
    “It is not against the law to protest,” 
D.A. Chief of Sta� Susan Schroeder 
said. “It is against the law to shut down 
a legal meeting so that no one would 
be able to speak,” “We believe that this 
is a victory for the �rst amendment.” 
   When the same argument was made 
in an appeal about 40 years ago, a su-
preme court justice found the penal 

code particularly troublesome since 
“...section 403’s prohibition of ‘dis-
turbances’ potentially may collide 
with safeguarded First Amendment 
interests” (In re Kay [1 Cal. 3d 930]).
     �e Muslim Student Union at UCI, 
of which one defendant is president, 
was found to be deeply involved in 
the protest. �e organization was 
suspended for an academic quarter 
and remains under probation. Emails 
and message board postings a�liated 
with the organization were found to 
have been integral to the planning of 
the protest. According to Schroeder, 
prosecuting the group as a whole 
would not have been easy for the 
D.A., since the Muslim Student Union 
is a registered student organization. 
     “We nurture a campus climate that 
promotes robust debate and welcomes 
di�erent points of view,” UCI spokes-
man Rex Bossert said in a statement. 

    Of the 11, three are students at UC 
Riverside — the rest are from UC Ir-
vine. All are said to have been disci-
plined by their respective universities. 
It is rumored that the Irvine students 
have been suspended for a quar-
ter, however the university refuses 
to comment, according to UCI Law 
School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. 
    “My view is that this is a crimi-
nal prosecution which never should 
have been brought. �e 10 students 
acted wrongly in disturbing Ambas-
sador Oren’s speech...” Chemerinsky 
said. “�ey were then properly disci-
plined by the university. �at should 
have been the end of it. �e prosecu-
tion was unnecessary and harmful.”  
     UCSD’s Muslim Student Associa-
tion could not be reached for com-
ment.

During their very first meeting of 
the year, A.S. Council has already had 
a rough start.

Sixth College Senior and previous 
Sixth College Senator John Condello 
a p p r o a c h e d 
A.S. Council, 
disappointed in a 
recent A.S. event 
held at Target. He 
pointed out that 
Target is a company 
that does not allow 
labor unions and 
has a terrible environmental history.

“You all are a symbol of UCSD and 
you need to act that way,” Condello 
said.

However, A.S. Council has already 
had some success. A.S. Vice President 
of Student Life Meredith Madnick was 
excited to announce that over 200 
students have already been signed up 
for A.S. Safe Rides. 

A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
announced that the Save Our Libraries 
campaign has resulted in even more 
student workrooms and computers 
once Geisel renovations have 
completed than there were even before 
CLICS was closed.

The entire A.S. Council board is 
excited about their recent changes to 
the website, including a live feed of the 
A.S. meetings available to the public 
online, just in case anyone is interested 
enough to watch but not attend the 
meeting.

Council has also created an all-
important new policy of announcing 
Council Member of the Week, where 
one A.S. Council member will be 
donned with a bright blue, glittery 
sash to wear during the meeting to 
be passed on at the next. The first 
ever recipient of this prestigious title 
is Revelle College Senator Caesar Feng.

“Caesar, during all of Welcome 
Week, was such a rock star,” Madnick 

said.
Even though it’s only week one, 

A.S. Council is already foreseeing 
challenges they will face this year.

An insurance issue has arisen 
between the 
UCSD and student 
o r g a n i z a t i o n s . 
Now, UCSD is 
requiring that 
anyone involved 
in any on-campus 
event, even if 
they are buying 

Korean BBQ on Library Walk, will 
be required to sign a waiver. The A.S. 
Council is charged with making this 
somehow possible. A.S. Vice President 
of External Affairs Samer Naji has 
also informed the council that UC is 
planning on raising tuition yet again 
this year.

“Be prepared to fight that when it 
comes,” he said.

In an attempt to open up 
communication between students 
and A.S. Campus-wide Senator Carlos 
Molina has started an experiment 
project, in which a white board will be 
placed on Library Walk where students 
can write notes directly to A.S. Council 
regarding what they think about A.S. 
Council and what A.S. Council should 
do.

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Bryce Farrington 
put together a presentation about 
the revised student conduct code. 
Changes include certain definitions, 
jurisdictions and sanctions. 
Additionally, student advocates are not 
mentioned at all.

A.S. Council fiercely debated 
funding a Day of the Dead event 
for UCSD’s Latin American Student 
Organization discussing the role of 
skull candies and deciding if they were 
to be considered decoration or food. 
Tough call A.S., tough call.

hopes that the UC Regents will work 
towards goals of broad access to 
Californians in order to remain one 
of the top public universities in the 
world and to keep tuition affordable.

“It’s not about me,” he said. “It’s 
an extraordinary institution that pro-
vides a remarkable benefit and the 
state is effectively stepping away from 
support of it. People who want to see 
UC maintain the three goals have got 
to step up in support of UC and get 
the state legislature to start behaving 
differently.”

Crane has faced opposition due 
to his previous position as finan-

cial advisor to former Governor 
Schwarzenegger and statements he 
has made against collective bargain-
ing rights in an op-ed published in the 
San Francisco Chronicle.

“Collective bargaining is a good 
thing when it’s needed to equalize 
power, but when public employees 
already have that equality because 
of civil service protections, collective 
bargaining in the public sector serves 
to reduce benefits for citizens and 
to raise costs for taxpayers,” Crane 
wrote.

This op-ed was a source of the 
opposition to Crane, led by the UCSA 
and state Senator Leland Yee (D-San 
Francisco). According to a May 2011 

UCSA press release, they were not 
informed of Crane’s appointment.

According to Crane, he originally 
became interested in the position 
because he has an interest in improv-
ing California’s higher education.

Once his term as UC Regent ends, 
Crane will continue to be president of 
Govern For California and a lecturer 
at Stanford University. Crane is plan-
ning to attend the Regents meeting in 
November, the final Regents meeting 
for 2011. If action is not taken to con-
firm him, it will also be Crane’s final 
meeting.

Paul Jablonski said in “Mid-Coast 
Trolley gets key federal approval” 
in the Sept. 16 San Diego Union-
Tribune. “It means the federal gov-
ernment recognizes this as a needed 
and valuable piece of transportation 
infrastructure. It is a major step for-
ward toward federal funding.”

The trolley extension is only part 
of a larger transportation plan to 

reduce green house gases, a new 
California law that requires the dif-
ferent regions to show how they will 
reduce their green house gas emis-
sions with transit and freeways.

San Diego Association of 
Governments (Sandag) officials 
were confident that they were mak-
ing strides by working with the 
Metropolitan Transit System.

“We are advancing environmen-
tal and design efforts to deliver this 

project as fast as possible,” Sandag 
Executive Director Gary Gallegos 
said in the same Sept. 16 Tribune 
article.

The planners expect the Mid-
Coast Corridor Trolley to provide 
service to at least 20,000 riders a day.

The approval moves the project 
into preliminary engineering.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

As a result of Mothers Against Drunk Driving’s (MADD) unrelenting crusade against 
alcohol, a bill (Assembly Bill 183) that 
would ban the sale of alcohol at self-
checkout lanes is now on Gov. Jerry 
Brown’s desk. Despite MADD’s noble 
intentions, there is scant evidence to 
support their cause.

MADD cites only one survey and 
one scientific study to support their 
claim that minors abuse self-checkout 
lanes in order to buy alcohol. A 
2009 survey on the frequency of ID 
checks conducted by the Community 

Economic Development Clinic at 
UCLA used participants as old as 41. 
Therefore, any alcohol purchasers 
whose IDs remained in their pockets 
may not be due to the incompe-
tency of the clerks, but the number 
of wrinkles on customers’ faces. And 
the SDSU study from 2010 cited — 
though it is more comprehensive 
— doesn’t even compare the effective-
ness of self-checkout lanes to regular 
checkout lanes. However, it does 
conclude IDs were not checked 10 
percent of the time. On the flip side, 
one study in 1995 actually showed 
that regular checkout lanes had a 44 
percent failure rate to check IDs.

Yes, that’s right: self-checkout 
lanes may be even more effective at 
stopping alcohol sales to minors, yet 
Sacramento has pushed a bill that 
would ban it. According to the 2008 
National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health, nearly 80 percent of minors 
get their alcohol from providers over 
the age of 21.

The California Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control states 
there is no evidence to support 
MADD’s claim. Between 2008 and 
2011, of the 2,300 accusations of sell-
ing alcohol to minors, 90 percent were 
attributable to small liquor stores, and 
only four percent to large supermar-
kets with self-checkout lanes.

Part of the reason it has gotten 
to Brown’s desk is the United Food 
and Commercial Workers’ (UFCW) 
claim that self-checkout lanes are 
killing jobs. This is no different than 
the Luddites in 19th-century England 
who destroyed machines because they 
‘killed’ jobs. Anti-technological fervor 
is no reason to sign a bill into law.

What’s worse is that grocery chains 
that rely on self-checkout lanes like 
Fresh & Easy will now have to hire 
cashiers just for alcohol purchases. 
This bill would increase employment 
costs causing the store to raise prices 
on their products. Students and the 
unemployed will particularly suffer 
from these prices while only a few 
new employees will reap any gain 
from this bill.

Undoubtedly, Governor Brown 
should veto this bill if he wants to

Last Saturday, Orange County judge Peter Wilson put an end to a UC legal saga that had all the hallmarks of a court drama: police, free speech, protests and Middle 
Eastern politics. The bad news: As of approximately 
2 p.m. on Sept. 24, 10 UC students now have crimi-
nal records for disrupting a speech. The good news: 
It could have been worse. The students — charged 
with the misdemeanors of “conspiracy to disrupt a 
public meeting” and “disruption of a public meet-
ing” — faced jail time, and ended with sentences of 
community service and fines instead. But while 56 
hours of community service is a relief compared to a 
year behind bars, it’s a shame that District Attorney 
Tony Rackauckas saw the need to prosecute in the 
first place — after the university had already pun-

ished the students. 
Let’s rewind. In February 2010, 11 students at 

UC Irvine were arrested for disrupting a speech on 
U.S.-Israeli relations given by Israel’s ambassador to 
the United States, Michael Oren. The students — 
now labeled the “Irvine 11,” though charges against 
one were dropped — interrupted Oren’s speech and 
accused him of “propagating murder” and being “an 
accomplice to genocide” before being escorted out of 
the building by police. (Oren spoke at UCSD prior 
to the incident at Irvine; though he was met with 
protesters, they mostly stayed outside the building 
and there were no notable disruptions.)

After an investigation, the university discovered 
that the protest was planned by the UCI Muslim

Regent Confirmation Must Look Beyond Unpopular Political Beliefs 

UC Regent David Crane has quite the track record. He served as a special eco-
nomic advisor to former California 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. He 
donated large sums of money to 
aid Republican Tom Campbell’s 
attempt to snatch Barbara Boxer’s 
senate seat and even helped fund 
San Francisco’s Measure B — a bill 
that attempted to curb the pension 
and health benefits of city employ-
ees. Crane’s Feb. 27 op-ed in the San 
Francisco Chronicle sparked con-
troversy when he openly expressed 
his anti-union and pro-collective 
bargaining political stance. In short, 
he’s a liberal’s nightmare. 

Politics aside, Crane has con-
sistently expressed a concern for 
tuition hikes while keeping students 
in mind. His goals as a UC Regent 
parallel those of students — lower-
ing tuition is one of his main con-
cerns. So why won’t Crane be back 
this coming winter? The answer 
comes down to logistics. 

Crane is not a confirmed regent 
just yet, since he was appointed at 

the last minute by Schwarzenegger 
in December 2010. His appoint-
ment sparked controversy among 
those who disagree with his pro-
collective bargaining and anti-union 
stances. Because of the nature of his 
appointment, Crane has to be voted 
in by the California Senate by Dec. 
27 in order to become an officially 
confirmed regent who can serve a 
full term. But the state Senate will 
be in recess from Dec. 5 until Jan. 4. 
This means a mere eight days and a 
couple senators singing “Auld Lang 
Syne” is all that’s keeping Crane 
from being reinstated. 

Whether one supports Crane’s 
platforms or not, the reality of this 
obstacle is absurd and once again 
highlights the convoluted nature of 
our state’s bureaucracy. It’s apparent 
that many bureaucrats disagree with 
Crane’s anti-union stance (rightly 
so) but because of this, they are 
standing idly by while Crane loses 
his position due to a logistical error 
rather than a problem of qualifica-
tions. In essence, his right to a fair 
trial is being violated. 

Crane’s consideration for the 
position of a confirmed UC Regent 
should be based solely on his goals 
for the public university system and 
his actions thus far, despite heavy 
student and worker opposition 
based on Crane’s right-wing stances 
on unions and collective bargain-
ing. The state’s political apathy 
towards Crane is far from subtle 
and although he’s nothing but open 
with his political views, he is sadly 
becoming the butt of this bureau-
cratic joke.

Crane’s recent statements in the 
Guardian are far more democratic 
than expected. His concern for the 
perpetually undermined middle 
class is both surprising and com-
forting but do not reflect his overall 
political stance. 

We may not all agree with his 
less-than-empathetic view for 
union members (read: blue collar 
America) but like any fair govern-
ing board, the UC Board of Regents 
(which currently consists of 26 vot-
ing members) should have a diverse 
bevy of political viewpoints to be as 

effective as possible.
The ability to juggle mounds 

of bureaucratic nonsense may be a 
necessary trait for a UC Regent — 
but it shouldn’t be necessary to keep 
their jobs.

THE MENTAL FISHBOWL By Alex Nguyen 

 
Dear Editor,

As the Irvine 11 trial draws to 
a close and the students involved 
discuss the possibility of appealing 
the decision, I feel compelled to 
point out the double standard that 
condemns 10 Muslim students to 
criminal charges for behavior that 
has been customary procedure for 
college protests spanning a spec-
trum of issues and contexts. 

That Muslim students chose 
to speak out against the Israeli 
ambassador in favor of Palestine 
seems to be the deciding factor in 
this case; indeed, there have been 
several instances where protesters 
expressed dissent in a similar pat-
tern and were neither arrested nor 
prosecuted, their affiliated organi-
zations were not incriminated, and 
their entire community was not 
put on trial for their actions. 

In fact, on Sept. 8, 2011, Code 
Pink protesters interrupted former 
Vice President Dick Cheney dur-
ing his speech in Orange County, 
CA in much the same way as the 
Irvine 11 had done roughly a year 
earlier. During Justice in Palestine 
Week 2011, one of the evening 
events arranged by the Muslim 
Student Association on this cam-
pus was delayed for 45 minutes 
because an individual chose to 
disobey posted guidelines and 

attempted to videotape the speak-
ers against their will. 

While the individuals in both 
cases were simply escorted out of 
or allowed to leave the gathering, 
the Irvine Muslim students were 
arrested and slapped with criminal 
charges simply for speaking their 
mind. 

If the issue really was about 
shutting down the free speech 
of the speaker at the podium, as 
some opponents of the Irvine 
11 claim, then the punishment 
afforded to the Irvine 11 would 
be applied to all individuals who 
decide to disrupt speech, regard-
less of their religious or political 
convictions. 

Freedom of speech is not a 
selective right; it is ensured to all 
citizens of the United States—even 
ambassadors from foreign coun-
tries—and should not be used as 
an excuse to deliberately stifle spe-
cific opinions and identities.

Irvine 11 Punished 
Despite Free Speech

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Irvine 11 May Not be Protected by First Amendment
Student Union. The university suspended the MSU, 
disciplined the students in question and passed the case 
along to Rackauckas.

Here’s where the case gets caught up in legal nice-
ties, with, ironically, both sides claiming censorship. The 
Irvine 11 claimed they were merely exercising their con-
stitutional rights, while the prosecution, and free speech 
experts such as Dean of UCI Law Erwin Chemerinsky, 
said that the First Amendment does not protect behav-
ior that infringes on other people’s rights. According to 
Rackauckas, the person censored in the Irvine 11 case 
was not any of the students, but Oren himself. There 
are methods of protesting that don’t silence the person 
speaking, but the students interrupted Oren’s speech to 
the point where he was unable to continue. Given this, 
evidence of MSU emails planning the event and video of 
UCI officials pleading with the students, it’s not surpris-
ing that the jury decided on a guilty verdict. 

In the aftermath of the verdict, defense attorney Lisa 

Holder has announced plans to appeal, according to the 
Jewish Journal, but the heart of the issue is not neces-
sarily the inns and outs of the First Amendment but the, 
as Chemerinsky told the Los Angeles Times, “terrible 
mistake” of prosecuting the case. Yes, the students defi-
nitely broke university protocol and probably crossed a 
line. Yes, it may be debatable whether they are protected 
under free speech. But the decision to prosecute them 
is an example of inconsistency that hurts everyone. UCI 
administrators had already punished the students and 
their organization, so there was little need to escalate the 
consequences. Many college students continually take 
actions that would technically be labeled a misdemeanor 
in court, but because their cases don’t involve high-
profile politicians and highly controversial issues, they 
don’t become a lesson in not crossing important people. 
Ultimately, there’s little to be gained for anyone in the 
decision to pursue the case and the decision to burden a 
bunch of 20-somethings with criminal records for life.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

W
hile recording last fall’s Fires 
of Comparison EP, Brandon 
Welchez and Charles Rowell of 
noise-pop duo Crocodiles shared 

a pipe with a homeless man in San Diego’s 
Presidio Park. It didn’t end well.

“If you play with fire, you’re gonna get 
burned,” Welchez told the Guardian in an 
email interview. “Or in our case, strep throat.”

But rather than waiting for their singing 
voices to return, Crocodiles released Fires 
of Comparison as an entirely instrumental 
album to be enjoyed, according to their offi-
cial press release, “under the mind-altering 
influence of 2XB-27, a drug concocted in 
Charles’ toilet by their friend, Dr. Russel 
Cash.”

It’s this kind of unprovoked jackassery 
that gained the public approval of art-punk 
juggernauts No Age, doused their debut 
LP Summer of Hate in irresistible, fuck-you 
charm and landed Crocodiles on just about 
every notable “up-and-coming” list in the 
blogosphere. 

Longtime friends and San Diego natives 
Welchez and Rowell formed Crocodiles in 
2008 after the breakup of their former experi-
mental hardcore act The Plot to Blow Up 
the Eiffel Tower. In response to their vapid, 

sunburnt environment, the pair began craft-
ing punchy pop songs about love and death 
— buried under distorted drums, reverbed 
guitar hooks and layers of piercing feedback 
— that captured the pent-up angst and adren-
aline of bands like the Velvet Underground 
and the Jesus and Mary Chain. 

But as far as Welchez is concerned, the 
influences end there. Since their inception, 
Crocodiles have focused on evading criti-
cal pin-downs, following their own creative 
intuition.  

“That shit follows any new band,” Welchez 
said. “It doesn’t really bother us. I’d say it 
makes the journalist who’s writing those com-
parisons look stupider.”

On the heels of their well-received 2009 
debut, Summer of Hate, Crocodiles entered 
the studio last year with English producer 
and Simian Mobile Disco frontman James 
Ford (Arctic Monkeys’ Suck It and See, 
Klaxons’ Myths of the Near Future) for their 
sophomore release, Sleep Forever.

“Production was just as important on 
Summer of Hate, it’s just that we had far less 
tools to work with, and us and our friend 
[and producer] Jon Greene were learning 
a lot as we went,” Welchez said. “James was 
great, he was a lot of fun to work with.”

Tapping a wider array of influences, from 
krautrock to 1960s she-pop, and racking up 
more than a few album-of-the-year nods, 
Crocodiles have wasted little time preparing 
their next project. 

“We just spent the summer in Europe, 
playing festivals and recording our third 
album,” Welchez said. “We were in Berlin all 
September, living in a flat and recording the 
album. It was great.”

Now, with UCSD’s iconic Ché Café facing 
$12,000 in debt and threats of foreclosure, 
Crocodiles are returning to San Diego to rally 
support for the influential venue and local 
landmark.

“Crocodiles have only played [at] the Ché 
two or three times, but since we were teenag-
ers it was our stomping ground,” Welchez 
said. “I’ve seen so many of my favorite shows 
there and played there a million times with 
old bands. When I read that it was in finan-
cial trouble I contacted a friend who volun-
teers there and asked if we could organize a 
benefit. It’s important to me that we do our 
part because the Ché played such a big part 
in our own musical history.”

The benefit show takes place tonight at 7:30 
p.m., with fellow locals Heavy Hawaii and 
Plateaus opening. Tickets are $10.

I’ll Judge This 
Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Hall of  Lame
It may seem like an obvious state-ment, but I have to say it: I love rock ‘n’ roll. 

Yeah, everyone likes The Beatles. 
Everyone likes Led Zeppelin. But my 

obsession is much more serious than 
that. When I was little, and my friends 
were watching Disney Channel, I’d be 
flipping to VH1 — ogling “Pop Up 
Video” and learning about drug over-
doses on “Behind the Music.”

So, obviously, I was pretty excited 
to hear the announcement of the latest 
nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame earlier this week.

Like the years before it, this year’s 
crop includes an odd assortment of 
radio staples and more obscure pioneers: 
Guns N’ Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, 
the Beastie Boys, Joan Jett and the 
Blackhearts, the Cure, Heart, Eric B. and 
Rakim, the Small Faces/Faces, Donna 
Summer, Rufus with Chaka Khan, War, 
Laura Nyro, Donovan, Freddy King and, 
finally, the Spinners. 

Here’s my personal take on which five 
artists deserve to actually be inducted on 
April 14, 2012:

Beastie Boys: This one’s a no-brainer. 
The Beasties have been a major force in 
hip hop since their 1986 debut Licensed 
To Ill — the first rap album to hit No. 1 
on the Billboard 200. And, unlike most 
of the other nominees, they are still 
going strong. Last spring’s Hot Sauce 
Committee Part Two is, thus far, one of 
my favorite releases of the year — an 
album chock-full of freewheeling rhymes 
just as goofy and ambitious as the ones 
the Beasties spit when they were young.

The Cure: They’ve inspired some very 
unfortunate goth fashion, but the Cure’s 
contribution to pop music is indelible. 
From upbeat romps like “Close To Me” 
to rom-com mainstays like “Friday I’m 
In Love” to moody landmark albums like 
Pornography and Disintegration — which 
ultimately inspired countless shoegazers 
(for better or for worse) — the immor-
tally morose rockers have never wavered. 

Guns N’ Roses: I actually really 
despise Guns N’ Roses — their brand 
of slimy cock rock has always rubbed 
me the wrong way and Axel Rose is the 
biggest douchebag in rock music — but 
the influence of their 1987 instant-classic 
Appetite For Destruction can’t be denied. 
In a decade that had mainstream rock 
‘n’ roll mostly defined by embarrassing 
glam metal and Bret Michaels’ hair, GnR 
look like goddamn saviors. 

The Small Faces/Faces: It’s peculiar 
that these two very different bands are 
lumped together; Though members of 
the mod-pop outfit The Small Faces 
would eventually join Rod Stewart and 
Ronnie Wood and rename themselves 
Faces, the two bands sound noth-
ing alike. Either way, The Small Faces’ 
Ogden’s Nut Gone Flake and Faces’ wild 
rock ‘n’ roll legacy (immortalized in the 
image of a boozed-out Stewart), make 
the set perfect for the Hall of Fame.

Donna Summer: Yes, this is the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yes, Donna 
Summer is disco. Yes, disco and rock 
are immortal enemies. But, let’s be real, 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is really 
just the Pop Music Hall of Fame, and 
Donna Summer easily defined an entire 
generation of dance music. She deserves 
recognition for that, whether her genre is 
dead or not.

MOVIE REVIEW

Breaking the Rules 
of  the Game
‘Moneyball’ is a new breed of  sports movie. 
By Neda Salamat • Senior Staff  Writer

Sports flicks tend to fall into two (somewhat loosely defined) categories: emotionally charged heavy-hitters that 
come with moral and family baggage in-tow 
(“The Fighter,” “The Blindside”) or sappy, 
gutless films about a horse (“Seabiscuit,” 
“Black Beauty,” “Sex and the City 2”).

“Moneyball” is an entirely differ-
ent ball game. In a narrative where ballers are benched and the

Dodging the 
Horizon
Dodging the Dodging the 



managers are up to bat, the biopic explores 
the story of the unsung antihero of America’s 
favorite pastime, Billy Beane (Pitt), the 
thankless general manager of the Oakland 
A’s. 

After being hamstringed by the smallest 
salary constraint in baseball (and losing a siz-
able chunk of the team’s top-notch players as 
a result), Beane teams up with Yale graduate 
Peter Brand (Hill) to revolutionize the way 
the A’s acquires players, using America’s least 
favorite pastime — math (or as it is known 
in the biz, “Sabermetrics” — where players 
are chosen based on who gets on base most). 
The result is a mismatched collection of 
seemingly delinquent players: league under-
dogs who surprisingly (or predictably, from 
Beane and Brand’s view) begin to impress.

In terms of popular appeal, “Moneyball” 

is akin to “The Social Network” (screenwriter 
Aaron Sorkin penned both scripts) — a film 
that, with all of its technical lingo, could eas-
ily lose the average filmgoer mid-shuffle. But 
just like its predecessor, “Moneyball” makes 
the potentially tedious relatively smooth 
— and with a far more bouncy, accelerated 
pace.  

Though “Moneyball” lacks the acidic wit 
of “Social Network,” it makes up for it with 
characters that radiate far more warmth than 
the former’s oily protagonists. Pitt’s jovially 
staunch every-Joe and Hill’s fumbling and 
soft-spoken savant balance each other out, 
creating surprising moments of goofy, broth-
erly camaraderie. Jonah Hill, first introduced 
to audiences through his boisterous slacker-
dork in “Superbad,” sits mute and pensive, 
offering advice and perspective only when 
asked. 

Pitt’s transformation is almost more 

unsteadying. Long gone are the days of 
“Troy”-esque concern for on-camera pretty-
boy glam shots — director Bennett Miller 
(“Capote”) has made the ageless man finally 
live all his forty-something years. And Pitt 
delivers: Gruff, upbeat and unyielding, he 
radiates fatherly knowing and charm in his 
dealings with both Hill and daughter Casey 
(Kerris Dorsey).

Miller, to his enormous credit, shows 
remarkable restraint from the director’s chair, 
opting for delicate directorial flourishes (a 
snarky off-camera remark, a change in light-
ing, an awkward pause) rather than bloat the 
tense moments for overly dramatic effect and 
dice it with a melodramatic score.

“Moneyball” may not pack “The 
Fighter”’s wallop, but its ragtag mob comes 
out the gate swinging — with a lesson in 
unflinching belief and loyalty that hits home 
in these rough economic times.

THIS WEEK ON CAMPUS

Canadian synth-pop outfit Purity Ring is the 
collaboration of Corin Roddick and Megan 
James. Receiving early blog buzz from single 
“Ungirthed,” Purity Ring’s dreamy harmonies 
have been described as “future pop.” UCSD’s 
own Kisses combine the sugary vibes of 80s 
pop with modern indie rock to create infectious 
gems that are both beautiful and introspective.

ASCE PRESENTS: NIRVANA: LIVE AT 
PARAMOUNT
THE LOFT / SEPT. 30, 8 P.M. / FREE

Get your flannel ready: In celebration of the 
20th anniversary of Nirvana’s Nevermind, AS 
Concerts & Events is presenting a film screening 
of “Nirvana: Live at Paramount” —  the only Nir-
vana show recorded on a 16 mm film. The set 
includes favorites like “Lithium,” “Breed,” “About 
a Girl” and, of course, “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” 

W hen Nika Danilova was a girl, she wanted to be an 
opera singer. “I think my lit-
tle baby toddler mind-heard 
some opera song and became 
fixated on how powerful it 
sounded,” she told Pitchfork 
in 2009.

On Conatus, her third 
studio album as nu-goth rock 
persona Zola Jesus, Danilova 
delivers a haunting testament 

to just how powerful — and 
versatile — the human voice 
can be. 

Where it once struggled 
to surface a sea of layered 
reverb, Danilova’s icy croon 
glides atop the cleanly-pro-
duced synth stabs of opener 
“Swords,” quickly shifting the 
ominous mood of the song 
with breezy, uplifting har-
monies.

“Ixode,” with its subtle, 
arpeggiating keyboard and 
repetitive bass line, finds 
Danilova emulating a gothic 
Stevie Nicks — her aggres-
sive, almost southern-tinged 
melodies cascading out in 
multiple counter-rhythms.

On “Lick the Palms of 
the Burning Handshake,” 
easily the most powerful 
song on Conatus, Danilova’s 

sorrowful, full-on popstar 
wail weaves in and out of a 
minimal electronic drum-
beat, rising to a triumphant, 
orchestral coda. 

And as if Conatus wasn’t 
eerie enough, “Seekir” sweeps 
ghostly tribal chants into 
a disconcerting ’80s pop 
groove, amounting to a sort 
of Lynchian cover of Yaz’s 
“Situation (Move Out).” The 
song then shifts abruptly 
toward a frightening, vocals-
in-reverse outro. 

While Conatus doesn’t 
explore much more stylis-
tic ground than last year’s 
equally disturbing Stridulum 
II, Danilova’s vocal command 
will send chills down your 
spine as dreams turn into 
beautiful, sonic nightmares.

Y ou are now free to let out that sigh of relief you’ve been 
holding since junior high. 
After a prolonged hiatus, 
Blink-182 returns to reclaim 
the pop-punk throne with 
Neighborhoods, the band’s 
first studio release in over 
eight years.

From the tinny, excessive 
drumming and open-chord 
strums (not to mention, the 

title) of opener “Ghost on 
the Dance Floor,” it is clear 
that Blink has not matured 
a bit. 

Tom DeLonge, Mark 
Hoppus and Travis Barker 
are as they’ve always been: 
full of dorky teen angst and 
infectious pop hooks. 

And though 
Neighborhoods’ first single 
“Up All Night” half-assedly 
attempts to interject mean-
ingful lyrics about raising 
children and finding one’s 
place in the world, the 
intended theme, as is the 
case with any good Blink 
song, quickly gives way to 
fist-pumping verses and one 
relentlessly catchy chorus. 

Closer “Even If She Falls” 
employs all the schmaltzy 
winners in Blink’s bag of 

tricks: some ear-worm 
lyricism, Barker’s patented 
ADHD percussion and the 
kind of bubbly tween-age 
chord progression that 
seems scientifically calcu-
lated for radio play. The 
track easily stands alongside 
past Blink superhits such as 
“First Date” and “What’s My 
Age Again?”

It’s formulaic, sure. But 
it’s a formula that made the 
darkest days of junior high 
just a little bit brighter.

After almost a decade off 
the map and a slew of failed 
side projects, Blink-182 has 
nobly managed to cling des-
perately to that inner child, 
even though we’ve long since 
grown up.

grueling conditioning drills, but one of the worst — and 
a particular favorite at UCSD — is the "black widow.” 
Interestingly enough, the "black widow" drill is known by 
most players as the "figure eight drill,” but the McManus tag 
is a bit more indicative of it's effect on a player’s lungs and 
legs.

The team is split into two, with each group at opposite 
corners of the field. When McManus gives the OK, the 
groups sprint the full 120 yards along the length, cut back to 
sprint the diagonal, sprint the other length of the field, turn 
the corner and run the diagonal to get back to where they 
began. The task is repeated at least four or five more times.

Moans and groans can be expected, but like a general 
addressing his troops, McManus always tries to keep the 
ultimate goal in mind for his players: a national tournament 
berth.

This is a goal that's probably hard to forget when just last 
season the squad finished No. 2 in the nation, after a crush-
ing 4-0 loss to Grand Valley State in the NCAA title game.

In his thick Scottish accent, McManus can often be heard 
saying, "I don't care who finishes first or who finishes last, 
just do your best."

Oftentimes covered in sweat from the midday humidity, 
one of the 11 newcomers to the squad are tasked with col-
lecting the balls, jerseys, and cones and bringing them back 
into the storage room.

A second trip to the ATR is a must for most players, 
either to tend to bumps and bruises, or for an ice bath — a 
restorative technique used by a number of athletes to aid sore 
muscles. What it boils down to is sitting in a vat of ice and 
water up to your navel for 10 minutes. It seemed that when 
the athletic trainers figured this out, they also figured that 
if you filled a garbage can with ice and water it serves as a 
perfect ice bath for two, which is why you will see a number 
of soccer players standing in a row of garbage cans outside of 
RIMAC after practices.

Remarkably, most players still have a full day of classes 
ahead of them.

What’s even more remarkable is that the players are not 
only ready to repeat the routine five days out of the week, but 
are also ready to run themselves through the wringer in the 
hopes of a postseason berth.

Women’s Soccer “Puts the 
Work In” for a Shot at a 
Postseason Berth
▶ UDA, fromÊpageÊ11

Last season Johnson connected with 
Wilson four times on the attacking end, 
providing crucial goals in last year’s 
campaign.

"Our defense is pretty much like 
our first line of offense,” Armstrong 
said. “On corner kicks we usually put 
everyone into the goal box except for 
Spaventa and Danielle [Dixon]. We just 
keep making the runs to the posts, and 
they just keep going in." 

Up 1-0, the Triton defense took over, 
shutting out the Toros to cruise to the 
win.

Riding a seven game undefeated 
streak, the Tritons kicked off against 
CSU San Bernardino in their first home 
game of the season on Sunday. CSU San 
Bernardino — with a 0-4-1 record in 
the CCAA and last place in the South 
Division — is the only CCAA team to 
get a draw from the Tritons.

Just two weeks before, the then 

nationally ranked Coyotes 
forced a 1-1 double over-
time tie at their home field.

But the game between 
CCAA South Division 
teams was drastically dif-
ferent last Sunday, as the 
Tritons collected a resound-
ing 4-0 win. Within the 
first four minutes of play, 
UCSD fired off four shots. 
The Tritons' first goal 
came in the 13th minute, 
when junior forward Gabi 
Hernandez won the ball at 
the end line deep into the 
Coyotes' half. Seeing senior 
forward Sarah McTigue at 
the penalty spot, Hernandez 
made a perfect pass to 
McTigue who placed it into 
the back of the net.

The next goal came from 
senior midfielder Lindsay Mills, who  
beat San Bernardino goalkeeper Tiffany 

Mallick in the 38th min-
ute.

The Tritons put two 
more on the board in the 
second half. McTigue got 
on the end of another 
Johnson free kick to put the 
Tritons up 3-0. And with 
just 15 minutes remaining, 
junior transfer Taryn Bales 
scored her first goal as a 
Triton by touching the ball 
past Mallick.

Still without a loss, 
UCSD improves to 6-0-2 
overall.

Over the weekend, the 
Tritons will host CCAA 
North opposite CSU 
Monterey Bay this Friday 
at 4:30 p.m. and CSU East 
Bay at 12 p.m. on Sunday.

A Day In the 
Life: UCSD 
Womens Soccer
For an athlete on the women’s soccer team, practices are scheduled every weekday at 11 a.m., though players find themselves at 
the pitch around 10:45 a.m.  that is, unless they 
need to be in the ATR (athletic training room) to 
tape a bum ankle or rehab a busted knee, in which 
case players can be expected to hobble in anywhere 
from 15 minutes to an hour before they even reach 
the field.

By the time 11 a.m. rolls around, the players are 
laced up and head coach Brian McManus is headed 
to the practice grounds at RIMAC.

Practices vary in intensity. Before games, the 
25-man team (which looks more like an army, all 

clad in navy blue) might work on penalty kicks or 
play soccer-tennis (an aptly named game, which is 
a hybrid of soccer...and tennis).

Every other day, the tightknit and usually laid-
back squad puts aside the inside jokes and the gos-
sip, and focuses on what McManus calls, putting 
the work in.

Practices begin with the girls dividing them-
selves into lines to practice passing and then cir-
cling up for a stretch. Afterward, the squad usually 
divides themselves again, with starters donning 
jerseys for a scrimmage against the reserves.

Here, it would seem that things could get 
contentious. With 25 girls on the squad, and only 
11 players allowed on the pitch, tensions can run 
high, and practices are always competitions for 
playing time.

At the same time, all the players  from the 
starting eleven all the way down to the redshirts 
 appear to have a sort of consensus of collabora-
tion, a certain selflessness that allows every squad 
member to forget about themselves and do what’s 
right for the team.

This is clearly illustrated in the thick of the 
season, when as a way to save the starting elevens 
legs, the first string is, on some occasions, excused 
from the most grueling sprint and long distance 
training, while the reserves eagerly toe the line for 
sprints.

For a sport where a player can expect to run up 
to four or five miles in a match, a great deal of soc-
cer players does not enjoy the exercise.

Tritons Continue Undefeated Streak with Weekend Wins
No. 2 rank, but also sit on top of the South Division con-
ference standings.

On Friday, UCSD faced off against South Division 
rivals CSU Dominguez Hills, beating the Toros 1-0 under 
the lights of the Home Depot Center.

The Tritons found a quality side in Dominguez Hills 
 a squad that went unranked this year after they failed 
to make the CCAA playoffs last season. The game was 
tight, with the Tritons only outshooting the Toros 9-8 in 
the first half.

But just twelve minutes in, the Toros gave away a cor-
ner kick. Left-footed and right-footed defender Hayley 
Johnson sent a high curling ball into the goal box, which 
found the head of 5’9" junior defender Ellen Wilson.

The goal marks Johnson’s team-leading seventh assist 
of the season, as well as her fifth assist from a corner kick.

"[Johnson] can take the kicks with either foot, which 
means she is able to swing them into the box, forcing the 
keeper to make a decision at the top of the sixth [yard 
box], senior goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong said. She 
puts them in the perfect spot so that our forwards, or in 
this case our defenders, can run onto them."

UCSD Mens Soccer Gets1-0 Win in Home Opener
Sunday.

"I noticed that San Bernardino 
was very concerned about the cor-
ner kick, so I took advantage of 
their lack of awareness and headed 
toward the corner," Wolfrom said. "I 
looked up and wanted to put a cross 
to the back post and it ended up not 
hitting anyone and going right in."

� Although Wolfrom’s goal was 
the only of the game, there were a 
number of near misses. In the 32nd 
minute sophomore defender Gavin 
Lamming’s header just missed the 
mark. While on the other end, 20 
minutes into the second half Coyote 
forward Julio Ayala cracked a 
shot from 28 yards out that nearly 
beat sophomore goalkeeper Jesse 
Brennan.

� The win brought the Tritons 
back up to .500  3-3 in the CCAA 
and 4-4 overall after their 1-0 loss 
against CSU Dominguez Hills on 
Friday.

The Tritons were granted anoth-
er corner kick late into the second 
half, except this time Wolfrom’s cor-
ner resulted in a breakaway for the 
Toros.

Dominguez midfielder Ronald 
Ybarra looked upfield to find for-
ward Jordan Rover. Rover slotted 

a pass to freshman forward Henry 
Calistro who sent the ball into the 
back of the net to score the game 
winner.

The two squads battled up and 
down the pitch for the full 90 min-
utes, with 28 fouls called on the two 
teams collectively.

"I’m excited for the upcoming 
home games. I am excited to play in 
front of our fans who give us such 
great support," Wolfrom said. "We 
are starting to come together as a 
team and the goals will follow."

 With a 3-3 CCAA record  4-4 
overall  the Tritons are scheduled 
to return to the pitch for a pair 
of home games. This Friday, Sept. 
30, UCSD will face off against CSU 
Monterey Bay at 7 p.m., and on 
Sunday, Oct. 2, the Tritons will take 
on CSU East Bay at 2:30 p.m.

"The boys competed hard and 
played well last weekend, and we’re 
in position to win both games," 
assistant coach Eric Bucchere said. 
"This Friday against Monterey Bay 
will be another tough test for us, 
and hopefully we can provide some 
quality and entertaining soccer for 
our fans."

Both the UCSD men’s and women’s soccer teams collected wins in their first conference home games.

HOME FIELD FEATS

After defeating CSU Dominguez Hills on Friday and CSU San Bernardino on Sunday — their first home game of the season — 
the women’s soccer team has reclaimed the No. 2 
national ranking.

The Tritons struggled to find the net in their 
first match of the season, tying unranked, non-
conference opponent Western Washington 0-0, 
falling from the No. 2 ranking with which they 
began their campaign. Since then, UCSD has had 
no problem scoring goals, and with a 5-0-1 CCAA 
record, the Tritons have not only retaken their 

With the score still drawn after 74 min-utes of play last Sunday against CSU San Bernardino, UCSD midfielder Andisheh 
Bagheri lined up to take a corner kick. With all of the 
Triton attack and most of the Triton defense in the 
box, Bagheri played the short corner to sophomore 
midfielder Cory Wolfrom. Pulling a number of the 
CSU San Bernardino defense out of the box, Wolfrom 
launched a cross into the six-yard box, which bounced 
past the Coyote goalkeeper and into the far post.

 The goal proved to be the game winner, granting 
UCSD the 1-0 win against CSU San Bernardino on

Triton Golf  Finishes Seventh in Season Opener

Freshman Jay Lim was UCSD’s top finiser, placing 10th in the California State Intercollegiate Tournament.

PHOTO COURTESTY UCSD ATHLETHICS

The UCSD men’s golf team returned to the green in their first tournament of the 2011-
12 season on Monday, Sept. 26 to 
play in the inaugural California State 
Intercollegiate tournament.

The tournament, played at 
Diamond Valley Golf Club in Hemet, 
Calif., featured seven other collegiate 
golf teams, including NCAA Division 
II program Cal Baptist and NAIA 
programs Cal-State San Marcos, 
Point Loma Nazarene University, 
Arizona Christian University and 
Biola University.

The Tritons finished No. 7 out of 
the eight teams, after a rough second 
day on the par-72. Starting the day in 
sixth place, UCSD fell behind Biola 

by three strokes to seventh place by 
the end of the final day.

San Marcos won the tournament 
by three strokes, finishing with a score 
of 869 after passing up Cal Baptist in 
the final round. The Master's College 
and Point Loma tied for third with a 
score of 879.

After Triton ace Keith Okasaki 
graduated, the team leader in both 
rounds played and stroke average for 
the past three seasons, UCSD is look-
ing to fill in the gap.

The Tritons may look to freshman 
Jay Lim, who was the top finisher for

UCSD. Lim finished 10th overall, 
with a final score of 218.

Sophomores David Smith, Jacob 
Williams, and Lewis Simon finished 
with respective scores of 228, 231 
and 233.

"Jay Lim had a very good showing 

in his first college event," head coach 
Mike Wydra said. "Lewis Simon had 
a bad first round, but made a come-
back on the second day. David Smith 
has been steady his entire career, and 
Jacob Williams started strong but 
then had a very bad four hole stretch 
in the final round."

Next up for the Tritons is the 
Lindsay Olive Wildcat Classic hosted 
by

Chico State, scheduled for Oct. 
17-18.

"All the other teams have been in 
school for a few weeks, and so it's a 
bit of a disadvantage for us that we 
start so late," Wydra said. "We're very 
anxious to play in Corning — it's a 
very long and difficult course."
