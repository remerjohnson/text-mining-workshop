Chu over Jaffe in strong victory 
Independent candidate 
unchallenged in each round 

By PAUL FARWELL 
News Editor 

It took the AS Elections 
Commi ion and Judicial 
Board an extra week of 
hearings, appeals and 
invalidated voting to wrap up 
this year's AS elections. 

But with the late t 
campaigning charge again t 
the Student Action Slate 
dropped, results were finally 
released Thursday . The 
verdict: Henry M. Chu will be 
the next ASUCSD president. 

Expected to weigh hf'avily 
on t his year's results were 
both the invalidation of one 
day of vot ing, the David 
Tollner vs. tudent ActIOn 
Slate' cont rover~y, and the 
installation this year of a new 
preferential voting system. 

1 he preferential ~ystem, 
which eliminate~ the least 
popular candIdate in each 

round and transfers hi !her 
votes to t he voter's . econd 
choice, eem. to have had - in 
itself - a minimal effect on the 
outcome: hu defeated second 
place fini her Marcy Jaffe 
( tudent A tion late) rather 
decisively, from the first 
round, 412 to 397, until the 
final round, 804 to 564. 

Member of the tudent 
Action Slate contend, how-
ever, that the new voting y -
tern, combined with negative 
publicity stemming from libel 
charge made by "'W'" A *M*P 
candidate Tollner, diverted 
many vote."> away from both 
Jaffe and vice presidential can 
didate Alfred Kakishiba . 

Stephen Haskins, a slate 
member and a winner in the 
Muir College Rep race, com-
men ted thaI the two "most vis-
Ible" members of the late-
the president and vice 

SAS member upset over 
process of the election 

pre ident - were hurt by both 
a two day suspen ion follow-
ing a Judicial Board decision 
that a tudent Action flyer had 
libeled Tollner and a Guardian 
retraction apologizmg for the 
flyer.

tions) destroyed them politi-
cally and it kind of de 'troyed 
them personally," Ha<;kin

about it." 
Commented Jaffe," 0 many 

people (on tudent Action) 
won, and they were runntng 
on IS ues," adding that she, 
too, ran a campaign based on 
issues. 

"Unfortunately , we weren't 
allowed to go out and defend 
our campaign. And when we

again in violat IOn {'he 
a bsurdity of tho e fact~, a~ 
presented by t he Guardian and 

the JudiCIal Board, certainly 
destroyed my chance to get 
elected .. 

"I wa amazed I came in

Ironically, Jaffe ' bigge t 
urge of tran fered vote came 

after Tollner wa eliminated, 
(It is peculated that many of 
Tollner' 'econd, thIrd and 
fourth place voters placed 
Jaffe' name dIrectly after

glut tonous. These assert ions 
are at worst false and at best 
unproven.

Ignoring t he (act t hat being

but 11 was ineVItable that

consequence of sloth and 
gluttony .... It is s uggestive 
that weight reduction has 
rarelv been shown to be a 
useful treat ment for any of the 
chronic di ·eases. ,. 

rn a fourteen·year ~tudy of 
1233 people conducted by Dr. 
Andre ·, professor at John 
Hopkins Univer Ity and the 
Clinical Director of the 
National Inst itute on Aging, 
peopl e 24 to 38 percent 
overweight as defined by the 
statis tica l charts had the 
lowest mortality rate. After 
reviewing 40 studies covering 
over fi mIllion peopl, Dr. 
Andres concludes t hat "The 
desirable weight, if you want 
to li ve longer, has been 
underestI mated." 

Part, bu t certain ly not all , of 
the confUSIOn on thIS Issue is 

due to the fact that for about 40 
years American doctors as 
well as the general pu blic were 
us ing insurance company 
heigh t/weight charts that 
were based on erroneous 
information . Years ago, 
apparently, an insurance 
co mpany·co mmi ssio ned reo 
searcher conducted a tudv 
whose results sugge. ted tha't 
underweight people lived 
longer, and height /weIght 
guidelines were drawn up 
according to this data. Since 
recent evidence has disproved 
this st udy, the charts ha\'e

year For this reason, many 
researchers believe that the 
popular estimate that 43 
percent of Americans are

suh ... tantIated. (l don't know 
where "CUltIng It Off" - lIh. 
er [mean - "Keeping It L'p" 
get-. I he ."i!) percent est imate.) 

Al"o contradicting popular 
"wI ... dom" is the fact thatdiets 
do not work. Of course they 
don't work! If t hey worked, we 
wouldn't have to go on them 
hundreds of t lines in a lifetime. 
Ninety fiv percent of the 
people who lose weight gain it 
back and a majority of thei>e 
gain back more than they ever 
lost. One of the most recently 
proposed theories of fat, the 

llRenoir loved fat 
women to the point of 
marrying one ... " 

"Set·Point theory," explains 
very well why diets do not 
work. Basica ll y, the theory 
states that the human body 

ha ~ a certain set·point, a 
certain amount of fat that it 
wants to maintaIn. Depending 
upon whether a person is 
above or below the set·point 
the body wi ll either try to get 
rid of the fat hy allowing extra 
calories taken in to be burned 
off and by lowering the 
appet lle, or it WIll try to store 
more fat and thus drive the 
person to eat more. This 
th ory IS supported by a good 
deal of recent evi den ce. 
Includmg the fact that it is as 

difficult to make a (naturally, 
non·dieting) thin or "normal" 
person fat as it is to make a fat 
person thin , An experiment in 
which normal ·weight men 
tried to gain and to maintain a 
gain in weight by eating more 
illustrates t his fact. The men 
found they had to eat everal 
thou ands of ca lorie over 
what should theoretically 
have been enough to gain and 
maintain the extra weight. 
Over their set·poin ts, their 
bodies burned off the 
additIOna l ca lories. Thus , 
contrary to what what's·his· 
name said, the only viable 

,~ays for a human being to 10 'e 
weight permanently are to cut 
off a limb or to lower hi or her 
set,polnt. One of the best way,> 
to lower the set pomt IS to 
exerci" . 

Obviously , then, people are 
fat simply because they ar 
fat, and not because American 
society is particularly tolerant 
of fat people. In fact, we all 
know that this soclet\ is 
espeClall~' into/cYallt o( fat

o\enveighl people is, of all our 
prejudice", t he most potent lal· 
Iy damaging psychologicall y. 
Whereas if you are black and 
the world treats you bad ly 
because of it, at least your 
famIly accepts you, but if you 
are overweight you go home 
each night to loved ones who 
tell you that you are fat and 
should stop being such a pig. 
When 200 men were asked 
what they wou ld most like to 
change about their wives. a 
majority of them responded 
that they wou ld like their

The reasons why we are so

subj ect of another article, (and

Keeping it up 

And now a message concerning armadillos 
A column by 

BRUCE MACDONALD 
Don't think it doe n't 

matter that some people didn't 
like my past columns. We're 
after journalistic responsibil· 
ity here, and that includes a 
healthy respect for the 
sensitivity of our readers. 

enliven, are some facts about 
armadillos. 

An armadillo is fast. They 
can run as fa st as a man , even 
though they have a strange, 
awkward gait when they walk 
normally . 

It s sc ie ntifi c name is 
Da sy pu s no ve m cinc tu s. 
"Armadillo" comes from the 
Spanish diminuti ve of 
"armado, " or armored. Its 
covering, of course. is a series 
of armored, joi nted , bony 
plates. 

The quadruped can bury 
itself in hard oil in about two 
minutes. If hiding that way 

doesn't help, it can always 
cross a river - and here it has 
two choices: an armadi llo can 
either hold its breath (for up to 
ten minutes) and walk across 
the bottom of the riverbed, or it 
can dogpaddle across the 
sur face of the water. 

But wail. Armad illos do 
more. These relatively new 
arrivals to the Americas can 
jump vertically straIght into 
the air if their intense 
concentratIon is mterrupted 
while foragIng. 

And speaking of foragmg, 
farmers in Texas and 
LOUISIana fear crop damage b} 

the agile ammab. They arc 
sometIme" known to poach 
theIr poultry. too 

But armadIllos also help us. 
They are the only ammais 
besides man whIch contract 
the disease of lepro~y. 
Researchers thus need them 
for experimentatIon. 

The armadillo retreats to its 
burrow when it IS cold, which, 
for an armadIllo, is about 72 
degrees. 

Tt gets along well With other 
anImals, It seems. the 
armadIllo sometImes !>hares 
its hole WIth a rabbit. 

There I" a problem when 

you want to get an armadillo 
out of Its burrow. A.,ide fwm 
usmg a pickaxe, the only way 
you can do It I~ to tickle Its 
underSIde. 

A sad thing for the female 
armadIllo - but even more so 
for her kIds - IS that she 
cannot tell her young apart. 
Aft ern i n e m 0 nth s () f 
pregnancy, she gIves bIrth to 
four baby armadillos that all 
come from the ~ame egg. 

The armadillo eah insecb 
Well, that's all I can tell you 

about them, If you have more 
facts on armadillo~, we'd like 
to hear them. 

It seems the editors have 
found it ne cess ar y to 
apologize, so to speak, for the 
fact that this column hasn't 
been labeled " sati re" in 
boldfaced type. But then, 
neither were the Letters to the 
Editor concerning what we've 
been talking about here, but 
that's OK - I know you meant 
your letters as sat ire. as a sort 
of tongue·in·cheek addendum 
to go along with what was 
being said here. We agree on 
tenor and tone, at least. 

Being an obese person is really alright 
But maybe It 'S necessary, 

though, to respond even more 
directly to reader interests. 

When stopped the other day 
b) .omeone who politely 
expressed some encourage· 
ment, she had to reluctantly 
admit that I'm sti ll missing the 
boat. 

Education, she said, is the 
road to enlight enment; 
moreover, it would be socially 
remiss to di sociate ourselves 
from a phenomenon only by 
vIrtue of its scarcity, or 
because it had no immediate 
bearing on our lives The 
criteria of significance ought 
not to be tie toquantity,butto 
import and impact. 

Here, then, to enlighten and 

continued from page 2 
standards, wa. every man's 
dream girl. Renoir lovt..'<l fat 
women to the pOInt of 
marrying one and paintIng 
pictures of many others. 
Renoir 's women would be 
considered 0 bese by a societ y 
that is so disgusted by fat that 
it offers pre·pubescent (i.e. pre· 
fat) girls like Brooke hields as 
an ideal that adult women are 
supposed to emulate, but 
anyone who has seen Renoir 's 
paintings cannot help but see 
hIS women as beautiful and 
sen ual 

Thus. "Keeping It Up" 's 
contention that fat people 
"pollute the environment 
oblivious to thei r negative 

impact" is a moot one ([ am 
a~suming that b~' "negative 
impact" he means "dIS ' 
pleasing appearance." It could 
be, however, that he has heard 
reports of rovlOg bands of fat 
people sittIng on "mall

pun intended.) 

The Thin·ls·In trend could 
be considered a bentgn fad if it 
did not pose a seriou' health 
risk. Anorexia ervosa is a 
psychological conditIon that 
was relatively unknown 
before the 19605' and which is 
now widespread among 
AmerIcan women. Anorexic

Chu wins decisively; Jaffe upset 
continued from page 1 
flyer which he felt libelously 
connected him with the "Moo· 
nies," Tollner told the Guard· 
ian yesterday that the Student 
Action flyer may not have had 
as detrimental an effect as he 
had originally feared , 

"Actually I think it helped . 
If it hadn 't happened , r may 
have lost (by an even larger 
margin)," Tollner said. 

And he added, "Marcy may 
well have won if she had never 
printed the flyer in the first 
place. " 

The flyer which sparked the 
controversy read: "David 
Tollner, t he presidential can· 
didate for the SWAMP slate, 
describes himself as 'right 
wing' and has been endorsed 
by CAR.P" Rev, Moon 's col· 
lege organi zation (The 'Moo· 
nies.') Wh y didn't Tollner 
state these facts in the Guard· 
iatl or at the Candidates 
Forum?" 

The 'Moonies' did express 
their endorsement of Tollner. 
Tollner. however, objectd that 
the flyer implied he approved 
the endor, ement and had then 
attemptd to cover it up. 

A Judicial Baord ruling on 
the matter led 10 the im'alida-
tum of one day\' vOling. the 
suspension of some of Student 
Action's campaign privilege~. 
ami a let ter of apolos.,)'y from the 
SI udent Action slate printed in 
I h e Gila rdia II . 

Tollncr fini~hed in third 
place wit h ~6 votes. not far 
behind Jaffe's 4R I. The bulk of 
Tollner's transfered \'otes 
came from fourth place fin-
isher Joshua Harris 

* * * Even though only 18 percent 
of the student body (l6460ut of 
9302 voted) bothered to show 
up at the polls, Chu s tated that 
be was "pleased" about being 

electl.'<1, adding that "there is 
going to be a small percentage 
of people voti ng, and it's quite 
common at other univeL ities 
to have a mall turnout. I'm 
not surprised at all . It 's been 
happening throughout the his· 
tory (of UCSD). 

" It doesn 't bother me at all ," 
Chu added . 

Much credit to the success of 
Chu's campaign has been 
given to a highly visible and 
effective flyer drive. (One of 
Chu's slogans - 'Chu For 
You' - was a carryover from 
his successful campaign bid 
for the Commissioner of Aca-
demic Affairs last year.) 

Chu feels that his fl yer drive 
was successful, but, he adds, it 
was not the determining 
factor. 

"My posters definitely 
helped me in winning my cam· 
paign, but also, most students, 
I'm ure, read the Guardian 
and looked at what ] had done 
this year as AS Commissioner 
of Academic Affairs. and saw 
that l'vedone some pretty posi· 
tive things. That's why they 
voted for me. [ don' t thlOk ] 
won just on the basis of the 
flyers (alone). That '<; lu~t not 
possible," Chuaid. 

Chu also speculated that 
Tollner and Jaffe might have 
effectl\'ely elimlOated them· 
selves from the ran' "It (the 
\ tolatton chargmg bet \\een 
Tollner and Jaffe) could have 
helped Jaffe in so,ne way ... he· 
cause there wa,., mort publiC' 
ity for the slate. But In other 
ways it could ha\ c bt'en \ CI) 
detrimental becau e students 
read (t he newspaper and 
flyer). and ~aid 'All this poli: 
ticking going on' ... ," he said.

While the libel controversy 

may have proved to the disad-
vantage of Jaffe 's campaign. 

A new fee structure is

By HANK SCHULMAN

A recommendation t o

which cou ld cost UC students 
an additIOnal $300 for the next 
schoo l year drew mIxed

mem bers made an almost 
clean sweep of the remaining 
offices. Of the nine commis· 
sions, seven were filled by Stu· 
den tAction mem bers. 

Most notable in the Student 
Actions victory was the rein· 
stitution of Lee Anderson as 
the Commissioner of Aca· 
dem ic Affairs, an office which 
he held two years ago, and for 
which he was defeated for 
incumbency by Chu last year. 

And , with the exception of 
Jaffe and Kakishiba , most Stu· 
dent Action members were 
pleased with election 
outcomes. 

"[n spite of everything that 
happened, we have scored the 
biggest victory in this kind of 

group actIon here since the 
mld ·seve ntles," stated 
Haskind. 

"The whole idea that we did 
succeed to spite of the thlOgs 
against us. proved that we did 
have good Idea , and t hat we 
do have a strong base here at 
school, " he added. 

The other counCIl spots 
were taken (with one excep· 
tion) by members of Harn .· 
New Deal Slate. Among them 
were the victones of Kim 
Piontkowski as VIce PreSident 
and Marc Geiger as Commts· 
s ioner of Public Relations, 

The remaining office, the 
Commissioner of Student WeI· 
fare, was ftlled by Amanda 
White, an independent candt· 
date who ran unopposed for 

the office.

that is also tuition . 

"We'd be alarmed at such a

There i a basis that there is a 
higher cost of teaching

Frazer added the Uni\'er, ity 
would be reluctant to charge 
sl udents more than $1.350 per

Kyolic: natural panacea 
or just seasoning? 

As early as 3000 BC, the 
Babylonians used garlic to treat 
di ease, In Egypt. garlic was believed 
to give slaves the strength to endure 
hard labor, The Greeks used garlic as a 
laxative, diuretic and poi on antidote. 
During the Middle Ages, garlic was 
used to ward off the Black Plague. As 
recently as the early part of lhi 
century, American doctors had treated 
asthma, Whooping cough, typhus and 
cholera with garlic ,

Dr. Satosi Kilahara. profe-,sor of

However, Dr. George K. York.

By TOMMY LANNEVILLE 
A free concert of computer 

and other electro·acoustic 
music at the Center for Music 
Experiment will be given 
tonight at 8 p.m. at Warren 
408. The mu ic of five 
internat ionally recogn ized 
composers will be featured in a 
presentation employing a 
variety of playback systems 
tailored to the requirements of 
each work . The newl y 
refurbi. hed CME Tape Studio 
playback system will be able to 
accommodate the full dynamic 
and frequency range of these 
works. 

John Celona's Music in 
Circular Molions was 
produced using DfSTR, a real· 
time polyphon ic 4-channel 
spatial movement computer 
performance instrument 
created for a modified New 
England Digital Synthesizer. 
It includes varieties of spatial 
movement (e.g., clockwise, 
counter-clockwise, figure 8' s), 
multi -segment envelopes, FM-
ynthesized waveshapes , 

volume controls, filter e.ffects , 
and note velocities. Circularity 
of pitch sequence (eight 
possible sequences may run at 
any given time simultaneous· 
ly) allows for orchestrations of 
rhyth m, timbre, duration. and 
movement. 

Clollds by Lee Ray consists 
of masses of sine waves. Like 
so many sonic phenomena 
encountered the 'e days it te ts 
to destruction the idea of 
music . The piece creates 
streams, each of which has its 
own frequency and amplitude 
characteristics. 

Jean-Charles Francois Agate 
de Pales andes aux Frisolls 
d 'Alenois was realized at 
IRCAM using Musix 10 with 
an interactive program 
written in SAIL for the 
generation of smooth random 

waves. These waves OSCIllate 
s moothly between random 
amplitude levels placed at 
random time points. The piece 
presents these materials in 
several combinatjons. 

Richard C. Boulanger's Two 
Movements in C was created 
here at CARL. It is the fir st 
original composition produced 
at the facility and uses F. 
Richard Moore' s software 
synthesis language "cmusic," 
running on a VAX 111780 and 
the UNIX operating system. In 

Composers Boulanger and 
Ray will perform in concert. 

a way. It uses very modes t 
means: one instrument and a 
monophonic output. From this 
mono source a great deal of 
"spatial modulation" is 
perceived. The illusion is an 
interesting byproduct. 

The final piece, Joji Yuasa's 
Icon - On Ihe Source 0/ While 

'ois(' (1967). uses fi Itered 
band of noise in a quadra· 
phonIC presentatIOn. An 
extraordinary liveliness of

Crew success 
is team'Work 

By THOMA CHMIDT 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Women' s 
Lightweight Crew team is the 
defending national champion 
and barring some kind of 
disasler, will surely repeat the 
accom plis hment. What makes 
this group of eight assorted 
undergraduates so good? In a 
word, teamwork! 

Unlike other hports, there 
can be no "superstar" on a 
crew team, becau e if one 
member is much stronger than 
the others the whole boat gets 
thrown out of kilter. 

It sounds like a cliche, but a 
crew is only as good as its 
weakest mem ber. If one person 
gives up, or doesn 't give 100 
percent. the boat will probably 
lose. 

The lightweight team is 
comprised of eight strongly 
individual women and a tiny 
coxswain. But once st rapped 
into the foot s tretches that 
hold their feet in place all eight 
become one unit. In order, the 
mdividual parts of the UCSD 
un]t are: TIna Fleszar , 
Barbara Port, LIsa ox, ue 
DiSSInger, Lisa Benaron, Pam 
Lellis, Brenda Barry. Gail 
Walker, and coxswam Ann 
Schermer. 

In crew, the usual per onnel 
configuration is such that the 
lighter. "finesse" rowers are 
put in front positions one 
through three. Seats four 
through six make up the 
"engine room." These are the 
stronger members of the team. 
Seats seven and eight are 
usually occupied by the most 
experienced members of the 
team. The eighth position is' 
called the "stroke." It is this 
person's responsibility to 
establish the pace the rest of 
the boat will follow. 

In a race, for the firs t 20 
strokes the s hell will behave 
like "a bat out'a Hell, " 
stroking 39 per minute. Once 
at top speed , however, the 
st roke will slow it down to 35-
36 strokes per minute. The 

women race over a distance of 
1.000 yards, which is roughly 
5/8 of a mile. 

Gail Walker, when asked 
what was the most important 
quality in a crew member, 
res ponded, "ada ptabll it y ... 
Everv member of the cr w 
mus-t adapt. Especially 
important is that seat one 
mesh with seat two, and seat 
three mesh with seat four . The 
coach must carefully match 
each member of the boat, so 
that the shell glides smoothly 
and evenly through the water. 

The shell is propelled 
through the water in the 
"drive stroke." Eighty percent 
of the power in the drive stroke 
is derived form the legs 
pushing on the foot strechers 
driving the s liding seat back. 
Only at the end of the slide 
motion doe the crew me:l hor 
pull the oar to the chest. I 0 __ 
unison mOl ion of the seats 
slidin~ back to the drive 
POSIt ion also pushes the shell 
forward as much as t\\"o feet, 

Women's Crew Coach Jack 
Vallerga explains that "crew 
is a sport where the !iense of 
heanng i., more important 
than the sense of seeing. I try 
and teach the girls on my team 
to lis ten to the sound of the oar 
entering the water and leaving 
the water, You can tell if you 
are d~,ing it right by the 
sound. 

Coach Vallerga observes his 
crew teams from a small motor 
boat called a "yell boat." He 
pushes his team hard, but 
a lways with doses of humor 
interspersed with the pain. 
When upset about something 
the team has done, he quietly 
curses to himself, but he is 
always kind and gentle when 
yelling through his mega· 
phone to his crew. 

Coach Vallerga , a former 
coxswain at UCSB, joked , " It 
mus t be my Karma, but my 
crew teams are always small! "

Lightweight crew team 
continued from page 17 
Since the team is not as big and 
powerfu l as teams they 
compete agai nst, its members 
must wor k on tec hn ical 
superiority to beat their 
competition. 

In the lightweight competi-
tion, the team must average 
125 pound wit h no one 
weighing over 130. Coach 
Vallerga observed that "when 
they get close to weight, all 
crew people talk about is sex 
and food. As the sea on wears 
on, all they talk about is food.' 

Crew is not exactly an 
tnexpen ive sport. An eight-
man shell co ts between 
$6,000 and $12,000, a one-man 
boat costs between $] ,800 and 
$2,500, while a ingle oar cost 
$175. Crew members pay $]45 
per year for the use of crew 
equipment. All member of the 
UCSD community can avail 
themselves to the facilities 
provided by the Mission Bay 
Rowing AssociatIon for the 
arne $145 or $72 for six 

months. 
When asked what kind of 

people go out tor crew. Coach 
Vallerga responded "intelli-
gent, cooperative, goal -
oriented people. We had 110 
people turn out for crew at the 
beginning of the season, and 
there is an annual attrition 
rate of about 40 to 60 percent. 
T he people who are till on t he 
team t his late in the season are 
dedicated people, they really 
want to be here." 

On the East Coast, crew still 
has a preppy-snob appeal, but 
here on the West Coa t, and 
especially here at UCSD, 
people join the team for the 
"camaraderie" because they 
like being around "crew 
people." As Walker put it. 
"crew people are the best kind 
of people around." 

Coach Vallerga was once 
told by a rugby player that 
"rowing is going through life 
on your ass backwards, with 
no idea where you are going 
and scant rememberance of 
where you have been." To this 
Coach Vallerga replies, "And 
rugby is foot ball without a 
helmet!" 

Tay-Sachs testing 
continued from page 12 
pre-natal diagnosis (amnio-
centesis) is necessary early in 
the pregnancy. This te ·t will 
determine whether or not the 
fetus has Tay-Sachs Disease. 
If the child i affected, parents 
have the option of terminating 
the pregnancy and trying 
again to produce healthy 
ch ildren, or completing the 
pregnancy knowing what the 

outcome will be. With early 
diagnosis, couples can 
selectively produce children 
free of this tragic disease. 

One out of 150 persons is a 
carrier for t he Tay-Sachs traIt. 
The gene i more common iJ1

Sarcastic \Votnen are LAW 
By HANK SCH ULMAN 

Sacramento Correspondent 
Edith Banks and Virginia 

Cholesterol. members of an 
organization called Ladies 
Against Women , protested 
against t he Women in Action 
rally in front of the State 
Capitol recently. "Get this 
country on the right track, one 
step forward and three steps 
back," they chanted in unison, 
marching two steps in reverse 
each time they repeated the 
slogan. 

Banks said it is important 
that her organization expre s 
its anti-equality views. Her 
thru s t was to convince 
onlookers to help repeal the 
women's right to vote. 

Cholesterol (''I'd rather be 
called Mr '. Chester Chole ter-
01") stood nearby and added, 
"If God didn 't want us to be 
on a pedestal, he wouldn't 
have made u shorter than our 
hu ·bands." All the while, she 
was carrying a SIgn calling for 
"suffenng, not suffrage" for 
women. 

If not for the "Reagan for 
Shah" button on herpinkwool 
sweater, the 100 onlookers 
might never have known 
Cholesterol and Banks were 
pull mg on a sarcastic act as 
part of the Women in Action 
rail J, !> ponsored by the 
California Council on student 
Education and the UC Student 
Lobby. 

Ladies Again t Women is 
really part of the Plutonium 
Players, a Berkeley-based 
acting company renowned for 
its caustic political skits and 
parodies. 

Cholesterol and Bank s, 
whose real name are Gail 
Williams and Selma Vincent, 
were brought to Sacramento to 
express, through humor, the 
goal the rally's ponsors said 
they want to reach -
ma intaining women's educa-
tional rights. 

T h e ra ll y culminated 
"Women's Action Day," a 
gathering of women and men 
from all the University of 
California campuses. On 
Sunday, the group met with 
influential women working in 
Sacramento to di sc uss 
relevant educational issues. 

The most pressing topic 
mvolved attempts by the 
federal government to weaken 
anti-discrimination laws such 
as Title IX, a code which 
governs equality in education, 
according to UC Berkeley 
student Wanda Bandera. 

A bill pending in the U 
enate, sponsored by Sen. 

Orrin Hatch (R-lJ tah ), would 
"water down" the act by 
limiting Its provisions to 
students, leaving out faculty 
and administrators, and 
would reduce financial aid to 
women . 

Anot her measure ralliers 
were concerned about is a pilot 
program in an Diego which 
would require able-bodied 
women on welfare to accept 
work paying the minimum 
wage. Some legislators have 
talked about adopting that 
requirement statewide. 

Bandera said such a law 
would be unfair for single 
women with children since t he 
work requirement would 

make it difficult for them to 
attend school and further their 
education. 

Several UC students spoke 
in favor of a resolution, 
authored by Assemblymember 
Leo McCarthy (D-San 
Franci co), memorializing the 
Ca lifornia delegation in 
Congress to oppose any 
measures designed to weaken 
Title IX. 

McCarthy, speaking at the 
rally, said it "took a lot of years 
to get where we are now, 
rejecting di sc rimination 
against women in higher 
education. Sen. Hatch would 
decimate in his bill all the 
gains we've made in the last 
five years. 

"We've got to stop t hat right 
now," he warned. 

Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles) called on women to 
lobby hard for money and 
equality for women in 
education, admonishing 
ralbers to "write us, call us, 
visit us. Do this so you can 
direct u to the legislation you 
want us to approve." 

Watson and McCarthy were 
presented with blue and white 
"Women in Action" T-shirts 
for their addre. ses. 

The California Council on 
Student Education, which 
sponsored the two-day event, 
is made up of representatives 
from all segments of higher 
educatio n in Califor ni a . 
Among t heir other activitie is 
a voter registrat ion dri ve 
designed to net 250,000 new 
s tudent vo ter s for the 
November general election.

Philosophy 160: Philosophy of 

Religion 
course code #3976 

Dr. Avrum Stroll 
MWf 1-1:50 USB 4050A 

An issue now vigorously debated by phi losophers is 
whether religion forms a separate conceptual 
domain with its own criteria of meaning and under-
standing - and in particular whether efforts to 
understand or interpret religion by any form of 
scientific method, even when broadly construed, 
are misguided. The course will investigate the 
pros and cons of this issue. 
Philosophy 174: Philosophical 

Psychology 
course code #5035 
Dr. Dianne Romain 

l'IWf 12-12:50 TUI 110 
An examination of issues in the philosophy 
of mind and philosophy of action, such as the 
nature of beliefs, emotions and actions and the 
inter-relationships between them; the nature ofthe 
mental and conceptual issues arising in 
psychology.
