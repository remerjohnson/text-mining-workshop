RCG' Steps , 
Past COSA 

Near the end of the last aca-J 
demic year, students in Revelle 
College elected six students to 
a committee to formulate plans 
for a college government. 

Previously, the group was 
known as the Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs (COSA), but it is 
now called the Revelle College 
Government. Its composition 
remains the same--six students 
elected at large, three faculty 
members, and three administra-
tion representatives. 

The current members are stu-
dents: Tom Baer, chairman carl N~iburger, Miic~ Br':>'III:, ' SIll 

R~r, Sue Smith, and Sharon 
Wilson. The faculty includes 
Dr. Blanco, literature; Dr. 
Kroll, physics; and, Dr. Bur-
ton, AMES. The administrators 
are Ann Conklin, Resident Dean; 
James Kavanaugh, advisor; and 
Tom Hull, College Dean. 

What are the goals of the 
RCG? Mike Brown said that 
. ' Ideally, the government would 
extend so far as to rule on such 
things as the curriculum. -The 
real power," he said, ·should 
rest with the students and the 
faculty combined." Since the 
RCG is now in onlyan "advisory· 
Position and since student or-
ganizations rarely (never?) rise 
above this capacity, carl Nei-
burger was questioned about the 
"advisory" limitation. He said 
that it should be as advisory to 
the administration as ·the Par-
liment is to the crown. • 

Dean Hull was also questioned 
about the advisory capacity of 
RCG. He stated that it was the 
legal structure that regulated it 
to an advisory position, since the 
chancellor is legally in charge of 
the operation of the campus. 

As for the possibility of con-
trol of curriculum, Hull .said 
(reading from an Academic Se-
nate handbook) that the ' Aca-
aemiC ~nate Is solely in charge 
of the curriculum. Hull further 
stated that it was his feeling 

that if one is going to encourage 
organizations such as RCG, one 
should pay attention to them . 

He said that serious consid-
eration would be given their re-
commendations and, except for 
the most extreme cases, the 
recommendations would most 
likely be followed. He doubted, 
though, that such cases would 
arise because 01 the nature of 
the group. 

RCG's major job now is wri-
ting a constitution for the col-
lege government. They have been 
held up on this because of the need 
to take care of a backlog of old 
business they inherited from the 
old COSA. 

In the meantime, RCG func-
tions as the interim government. 
Money from the vending machine 
fund is presently their sole 
source of income. But Mike 
Brown said that they hoped to 
get funds from the ASUCSD.

Issues 
Black 

Call 
Identity 

Last Tuesday evening, in the 
Revelle cafeteria, Professor 
Harry Edwards guided his aud-
ience in a tour of racist Amer-
ca. 

Imploring the aUdience, and 
the whole country, to • begin 
to understand this stuff and look 
at it in perspective," Professor 
Edwards ripped the ·stuff- or 
stuffing out of American society 
and took a long, black look at 
what he found. Concluding that 
the role of the Negro in Amer-
ican society has been humiliating 
to his race, Edwards issued a 
call for a new community, a 
community with a Black identity. 

In this lecture, jointly spon-
sored by the Arts and Lectures 
Committee and the Black stu-
dent's Council, Professor Ed-
wards began by pointing out that 
the objective of politics is to 
control people, and that this 
makes the present crisis in 
America a political crisis. 

America, he says, has been 
trying to give non-whites their 
rights, while at the same time 
striving to keep these people 
under white control. Such ef-
forts as these have succeeded 
in creating a climate of white 
domination over non-whites in 
such areas as politics, education, 
and rel1(ion. 

It is on the topic of local p0-
litical leadership that Professor 
Edwards focuses his most sear-
in, attack. Charging that the 
stokes, Hatchers, and Whitney 
Youngs of this country have 
·prostituted" themselves before 
the white~stabl1shment, Edwards 
calls for new leadership. Lea-
dership that would recognize the 
need for Black identity, Black 
cultural roots, and would be pre-
pared to fight the white majority 
to gain these goals. 

The days of the nigger or 
Negro poUtician must come to 
an end, he declared, because most

working in the interests of the 
white man. Whites control the 

Negro -leaders ,· and it is this Following up on these examples

In the area of education, Pro- concept of justice is held by our 
fessor Edwards observed that society. He notes that the ques-
schools all across the country tion of civil rights for human 
are trying to create a white beings always becomes bogged

displayed the same hypocrytical On the other hand, this coun-
attitates as todays leaders. try sees no contradiction to the 

ideal of international justice when 
we move into such countries 
as the Dominican Republic and 
Vietnam. This double standard 
stands as damning evidence in 
support of Professor Edwards' 
charges. 

Black-oriented curriculums in 
either colleges or high schools 
are almost unknown, whlle such 
classes as music appreciation 
turn off the whites almost as fast 
as they do the Blacks. Edward~ 
contends that today's educatior 
denies that Blacks ever accom· 
plished anything, and gives then 
no role in today's society. 

Turning to what Blacks laugh-
ingly call the national political 
scene, Edwards concludes that 
this year's campaign offers nei-
ther the whites nor the Blacks a 
choice. Humphrey, he says, wa~ 
responsible for the biggest nigger 
law since the Emancipation Pro-
clamation, namely the Civil 
Rights B111 of 1964. Both laws, 
he points out, gave Blacks the 
rights that were supposedly guar-
anteed to all citizens under the 
Constitution. 

Edwards believes that if they 
were good enough for whites they 
are good enough for Blacks, aoo 
that if Humphrey really believed 
in their cause he would have en-
forced the Constitution. He goes 
on to point out that ther is 
really no difference between the 
candidates, and 11lustrates this 
point by recalling how the Mor-
mon Governor of Michigan, 
George Romney, had accused 
George Wallace of being a rac ist. 

After these comments on the 
American system were made, 
Professor Edwards proposed the 
creation of a new role for the 
Black in society. Rejecting the 
notion that what Blacks need is 
to be integrated into white com-
munities, Edwards points out that 
history has demonstrated that 
when different peoples cannot live 

togeth~r, they separate. So it 
was for the Jews in Egypt, and 
so it must be for the Blacks in 
America. 

Edwards makes it clear, how-
ever, that he is not calling for 
segregation, only separation. 
For while segregation implies 
control of that community from 
the outside, separation for Ed-
wards entails control ofth com-
munity by that community. Blacks 
must have control over their 
own communities , otherwise they 
will remain niggers under white 
control. 

In order to achieve thi , Pro-
fe ssor Edwards cites three goals 
the Black community must rive 
for: unity, audacity, and brains. 
Blacks must have unity if th Y

Students, 
Faculty 
Retaliate 

Reaction to the Regents ' ru-
ling limiting guest lecturers to 
one appearance continues to be 
t'ritical. At nearly everyone of 
the nine UC campuses AS gov-
ernments have censured the Re-
gents, and Academic Senate 
groups have generally protested 
the action in somewhat milder 
terms. At Berkeley, the center 
of the controversy concerning 
Eldridge Cleaver, the status of 
Social Analysis 139 X is' stitt 
in doubt. 

At VC Riverside, the Academic 
Senate met yeste rday to discuss 
the Regents' ruling, atter the 
student Legislature there vehe-
mently condemned that ruling. 
At UC Davis, the faculty passed a 
somewhat watered-down resolu-
tion Monday, urging the Regents 
to reconsider. 

student government at Davis 
passed a resolution supporting 
statements made by their ASB 
president in a letter to Charles 
Hitch. At Irvine and Santa Bar-
bara, the Academic Senates met 
ye sterday to consider the matter. 

Wednesday night at Berkeley 
more than 700 students gathered 
for a mass meeting concerning 
Cleaver and voted almost with-
out dissent to demand that fa-
culty members take ·concerted 
action" to defy the Regents by 
inviting outside lecturers to ad-
dress their classes more than 
once during the next week. 

Coupled with this demand 
which was also addressed to th~ 
teaching assistants, was apledge 
by the meeting to use ·any ap-
propriate means, including mass 
militant action" to back up fa-
culty members and TA's who 
find their jobs imperiled as a 
result of defying the Regents. 

The resolutions which were 
finally approved at the meeting 
were considerably weaker than 
those originally proposed by the 
coordinating council, which had 
adopted a more militant poSition. 
However, as the various propos-
als were introduced, it was an-
nounced that the council had with-
drawn its recommendation in the 
face of protest by more moderate 
members. 

students at the meeting a lso 
put themselves solidly behind the 
proposal to demand that faculty 
members give students enrolled 
in Social Analysis 139X credit 
for taking the course by means 
of giving 199 credit (Independent 
study) or by enrolling the stu-
dents in special sections of re-
gular credit cour es. 

However, the students at the 
me ting retus~d to attempt to se-
cond guess the Regents and de-
cided not to commit themselves 
to any specif~c action until the 
results of the Re t II xt meet-
ing at Santa Cruz were made 
known. 

As it stands now, Chanc Hor 
Heyns has reserved a clas for

he looked out acro s the black ea and up into the rain 
cloud lightning and horror and all sh e could ee wa de-

The night is upon her; the tide come in on huge black 
w aves knocking her down ; strangling her in the seaweed. 
She will die though life goes on . 

After the film on martyred Bobby Kennedy at the 
Democ.rat~c Convention, all the d efea ted liberal deJegates 
stood smgtng the Rattle Hymn of the Republic. They sang 
it over and over again-louder when they were gaveled 
d own. They sang as if as long as the music continued he 
would live, but when they stopped he would die. When 
they stopped, Mayor Daley was shouting "We want Daley" 
and then Hubert Humphrey gave his acceptance speech. 

Our hut hope rode on that song, a hope that they could 
go on singing forever, that the song could bring justice 
and prevent Humphrey's acceptance of what was not 
rightfully his. God damn, why d id they ever stop singing? 

We emerge from a summer in which Berkeley and Chi-
cago were both police states, and we find the Regents 
down on our necks. 

And today there is no McCarthy running to give us 
hope, to say there is a future, that we can turn this coun-
try around. We have no spokesman within the system 
whom the majority of people will believe when he speaks 
for our side. 

A s we stand in the wet sand on the edge of this sea and 
fight the tide of fascism, we are excited at fighting to-

They are shooting students in Mexico. They are shoot-
ing black people in America. And they are on the verge 
of shooting students. The Governor seems eager to send 
the national guard onto the campus. 

There are many of us who are hoping and trying to

The Regents resolution has wrapped u s in seaweed. We

write in golden curliques a royal pattern and the monsters

And the people on the beach will lament the death of 
Socrates and Jesus and Berkeley.

Editor, The Triton Times, 
The Indicator of September 25 

published a -report- on the 
Special Opportunity Program 
written by a staff member who 
taught in It. The document 
was one of a" number written 
to indicate critical evaluation 
of the University's efforts It 
was privileged and confidential · 
it was one man's opinion of ' 
the shortcomings of the pro-
gram; it was taken out of con-
text; and it reflects the judgment 
of neither the !acultycommittee 
nor the program staff. Indeed 
the overall evaluation of the 
program is positive. 

We are shocked by the Indi-
cator 's violation of an indiv-
idual's ri£ht not to have his 
confidential documents pubUsh- . 
ed without prior perrnlssion 
consultation or notice. We 
haDe that this viola tion will 

not inhibit others Cram inform-
ing the Commutee at their 
favorable or uilfavorabl anal-
yses of the program and sug-
gestions for improvement. 

The irresponsible publication 
of this document will not be 
allowed to damage the efforts 
of the faculty, administration 
and students to make UCSD 
available to all segments of the 
community. Students in the pro-
gram are not objects. We con-
demn the Indicator's m licious 
attempt to use every Black and 
Brown student on this campus 
as an involuntary instrument 
to further its own purposes.

It's the 

Editor, The Times: 
I have just read your article 

"Through a Glass Slide Rule 
Darkly," and there were some 
very good points in it. Unfortu-
nately it also contained some ri-
diculous exagerations and blatant 
fallacies . As an undergrad here, 
I feel it is my duty to defend 
myself and what I know as true. 

First, the gir Is that you de-
scribed as "popping the pm regu-
larly" and saying, "to hell with 

, the world" is a lie. I don't know 
what kind of women you have been 
going out with, but I know for 
myseIf that it just isn't true. Of 
course there are always going to 
be some that are like you de-
scribed, but to say that every 
gir 1 or even most girls are that 
way is ridiculous. 

Sure the women have it made 
around here, and everyone knows 
it. But that doesn't mean that 
just because every girl has it 
made that· she has been made. If 
you don't think that many of thE 
girls here are the way the~ 
should be, you ought to try goinl 
to a junior college in Los Angeles 

Secondly, when you say that we 
corne here to steal from the uni-
versity and our "friends" alike 
you are wrong again. Ihavefound 
few people like those you de-
scribed. Of course we all want 
an education from the university, 
but we also know that whatever 
we get will be through ou own 
effort and is not something which 
can be "stolen". 

As for stealing from our 
friends, I have found few people 
who are not willing to give more 
than they r~ceive. What makes 
them seem unfriendly is the fear 
that we all have, the fear that 
our friendship will be scorned. 
At any time each otuscanalways 
make ourselves happier by mak-
ing someone else happier. In the 
same edition of your paper a poem 
in a column by Hadashi (we all 
know him by another name) ap-
peared that goes like this: 

"Once someone noticed me 
above my tower walks; Someone 
saw the lonliness written there; 
Someone once scaled that castle 
wall, touched my hand and wa <; 
gone; It 's hard to live alone.' 

"Phillip Abbott luce-
The revolutionary 
who would rather 
switch and fight." 

Jack Newfield, 
Village Voice 

People 
I think most of us are like the 

author of the poem to a certain 
extent, alone in a castle but 
afraid to come down. It isn't 
that we don't want to make 
friends, it is just that we are 
afraid to reach out. Usually after 
contact is made we think not of 
what we can gain for ourselves, 
but what we can do to help our 
friends. 

Lastly, your comments about 
San Diego State were unwarrant-

. ed, vicious, and childish, and 
show that you, too, believe the 
myth that we at the university 
are far superior to the people at 
State, It's impossible to compare 
our schools because of the enor-
mous dIfference in size. Certain-
ly because of its size State is far ' 
more impersonal than we are. 
It is also not as highlyacademi-
cally accredited as we are. But 
to say that its purpose is to turn 
our "mental and e motional robots 
who care only about easy jobs, 
hot secretaries, and a fat sal-
ary. 

As Hadashi said in a speech 
at the coffee hut, "There are a 
lot of beautiful minds down 
there". Of this there is no ques-
tion. So let's stop this petty 
berating of our giant neighbor, 
and as Hadashi suggests: " .• . stop 
your stupid bicker ing. There is a 
job to be done, and if you're a 
student then why don 't you 'be-
come ' students." 

If you think I am one of those ' 
people who hangs around in the 
clique I picked out the first week 
and that ' biases all of my 
Viewpoints , you're wrong. I'm a 
commuter student from L.A. and I 
have attended Valley J. C. up 
there. Each day I spend about 
12 hours at the university. 

I am getting as good an educa-
tion away from class as in it. It 
isn't the buildings or the sj:enery 
that I love, it's the people. They 
are starting to come alive and 
your article is a perfect example 
of this life and vigor. Keep up 
the good work. 

Yours truly, 
Rick Heaton

Ship of Love 
Dear Friends; 

For centuries man has sought 
political, economic and religious 
solutions to his problems. These 
attempted solutions have been 
at times helpful and at times 
harmful. In any event they usually 
were directed toward symptoms 
of man's problems rather than 
to the real source and shape of 
his conscience. We propose todo 
something which is directed to 
the conscience of mankind. 

We are going to acquire a 
ship that can transport approxi-
mately 300 people and sail around 
the world as a gesture of peace 
and universal brotherhood. In 
order to do this we have rormed 
a non-profit corporation to or -
ganize this voyage. We have no 
affiliations with any political, 
social, or religious organiza-
tions. We will depend sole ly upon 
mankind for support. 

Perhaps you would like to join 
us. If you cannot come, you 
might like to help us. There is 
much to be ~one. 

We will try to get a govern-
ment ship--perhaps one of the 
mothballed liberty ships-and 
adapt her for our purposes. We 
will change a "ship of war" into 
a " ship of peace". The ship will 
be painted 1n beautiful colors by 
artists . On her sides she will 
carry messages of peace and 
goodwill from anyone who wishes 
to send them. In the course of 
preparing our ship we will pre-
pare ourselves for the journey. 
Before, as wei a<; during the 
voyage, it is panned that semi-
nars be held to ' explore and ex-
press the attitude of peace, non-
{iolence and love through dis-

~uss ion and meditation. 

None of the persons aboard our 
ship will be "passengers". 
Everyone will have some sort of 
duty, however small it mayseem 
to be. We shall all have an in-
teresting and enlightening ex-
perience. 

When our ship is ready we will 
christen her the "Mankind" . It 
is a good name-lor the whole 
purpose of our trip wlIl be to ex-
press the attitude that we are all 
one, a seemingly reluctant bro-
therhood, with only one world to 
live in. We are convinced that 
our one and only hope for mankind 

to survive is by love expressed 
through a gentle att itude and kind-
ness shown to our brothers. 

We intend to leave San Fran-
cisco in June 1969, and go to 
many ports. We will sail first to 
Hiroshima. There we will say 
that we are sorry for the terr ible 
bombing that happened. All of us, 
including the Japanese, are re-
sponsible for allowing it to hap-
pen. Our apology will be from 
mankind. not just from America. 

By going to Hiroshima, we 
will call attention to the specter 
of hydrogen bomb warfare, a 
specter we have all but forgotten 
except for a nagging fear in the 
back of our minds. 

Hiroshima will remind liS of the 
possibility of nuclear holocaust 
but it can also be a beginning 
place for a reaffirmation of the 
nature of God in man. There is 
much despair, bitterness and ~ynicism in people now, but'there 
IS also much reason for hope. We 
feel that our ship, "The Man-
kind " , can do much to symbolize 
this hope for all. 

The world now is fUll of vio-
lence and conflict. Forces of 
both concern and hatred appear 
to have become polarized into 
opposing camps . We feela closer 
look reveals that man is now 
more than ever before concerned 
with the treatment of his fellow 
man. There is more "life-force" 
manifest now than ever before. 
This force is expressed through 
love. n is everywhere and it will 
be aboard our ship. 

We will never reach a world 
of love through violence. Many 
who feel despair and bitterness 
now, may turn to violence. In 
one way this violence and hatred 
is a corruption of their desire to 
love and be loved. Because of 
feelings of futility and frustra -
tion in finding a venues for the 
expression of love, this love 
turns to hate. Our ship will be 
such an avenue . 

We are entering a "New Age " 
for mankind. It will not be anage 
of confllct in politics , economics , 
and religion, but an age of "Uni-
versality' in which we realize 
that all men are brothers , that 
the greatest joy in life is loving 
one another, and that we can 

never benefit at the expense Of 
another. In this age we will have 
no cause to fear or mistrust 
anyone. This will come about a~ 
we overcome our doubts , guilt . 
fears and selfishness. These bar-
riers separating man will be re-
moved aboard our ship. We hope 
this will be true for people all 
over the world. We want everyone 
to identify with our tr ip , and 
what we are trying to create, a 
pure gesture of love. 

Wherever in the world we stop, 
we will offer flowers , musiC, 
singing and dancing. We will have 
gifts for children made by other 
children. We will express our 
feelings as a group as we ll as 
personally. 

After our ship leaves Hiro-
shima, we will go where we 
think we can best express our 
theme of brotherhood. But we 
will consider the safety and well 
being of everyone on the ship 
as well as the people in the 
ports of call. We woula like to 
stop in China, Vietnam, Afr lca , 
India, and Europe. 

As we mentioned before we 
plan to leave in June , 1969. If 
you wish to go with us , or to 
contr ibute in any way please 
wr ite to MANKIND ... BIG SUR, 
CALlFORNIA ..... 93920. Those 
who wish to go with us will re-
ce ive a letter explaining aU of the 
details . Ifany school organization 
or interested group of individuals 
wishes to take on as a project 
helping us in this endeavor, we 
will be pleased to send a speaker 
fr om our group to talk with you. 

We will be supported entirely 
by donations from passengers 
and others who wish to contribute 
with their messages. We are 
welling to take passe ngers who 
cannot afford the ir own expenses . 
However since we are funded 
only by donations, we hope that 
eve ryone will make an effor t to

11 , 1968 

Fresh an Chancellor Reveals Philosophy 
Dr. William J . McGill, pro-

fessor of psychology and former 
cbairman of the Academic Senate 
at UCSD, was named chancellor 
of the San Diego campus by 
the Board of Regents last June. 
McGill succeeds Dr. John S. 
Galbraith, who resigned the post 
to accept the Smuts Visiting Fel· 
lowship at Cambridge Unlversit} 
in England, for the year 1968-69. 

McGill, who joined the UCSD 
faculty in 1965 as professor of 
psychology, has served as chair-
man of the Academic Senate and 
bad been named chairman-elect 
of the statewide Assembly of 
the Academic Senate. Due to 
his appointment as chancellor, 
he will not serve in either po-
sition this year. _ 

McGill has made outstanding 
contributions ina varietyotareas 
in experimental psychology, par-
ticularly in the fields of infor-
mation processing and mathema-
tical psychology. He is a Fel-
low of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science, 
and a member of the Society 
of Experimental Psychologists. 

Recently, the new Chancellor 
was interviewed by the Triton 
Times, at which time he com-
mented on some of the more 
important issues and problems 
he faces, such as the growth 
of UCSO, and the controversy 
surrounding Eldridge Cleaver. 

Triton Times: "Many students 
here feel that so much emphasl 
is being placed on research and 
attracting big name faculty mem-
bers that the quality of under-
graduate education is forfeited. 
How do you feel about this cri-
ticism?" 

McGill: " I think the problem 
is real, but I don't know how to 
answer it. I don't believe that 
we are actually at that point 
yet, but we may be in the fu-
ture. I think that the University 
has one prime purpose, namely, 
to stay on the frontier of know-
ledge. This can only be done 
through strong research pro-
grams. However, I think that 
the undergraduate education will 
suITer unless we do stay on tbe 
frontier of knowledge. Thus, 
I don't see how we can rectify 
tlie problem by curtailing ou r 
strong research programs. 

On the other hand, I don't 
see how we can continue to up-
grade undergraduate instruction 
in the face ol our exploding uni-
vers ity population. At some l 
time, we may have to lace the 
prospect of separating the re-
search facilities entirely from 
the teaching facilities. 

Our greatest problem is sim-
)Iy a reflection of the popula- , 
'on explosion. We find our-

"elves confronted with more 
freshman each year and we are 
not very well equipped to handle 
them. You'll find a great deal 
of talk about how small the class-
es are going to be at UCSO, 
but not much more. When we 
were confronted wit 'I an entering 
class of about 700 I 'eshmen, one 
of the lirst escape mechanisms 
is to increase the: ize of class-
es. And increasiJ .g class size 
is nly the first m !asure taken. 

As the problem ts "r)l'"jII. 
undjllrgraduates ar) liable to 
suffer even more. My big chal-
lenge is to insurE high quality 
education along wll h strong re-
search programs, despite the , 
tremendous growt!; pr ohlems we 
face. The univers Iy must grow 
at a pace equal to that of the 
outside society.' 
Triton Times: °00 you think it 
is PQssible lor a s tate college 
or university toaccompl1sh these 
things?" 

McGill: • That's the challenge 
of my job. What I think Is pos-
s ible is that we can avoid the 
worst eltects of prolllerating 

lower division unde rgraduate 
courses. At the present time, 
there are no re strictions on 
Third College to devise a course 
system or credits that Is in any 
way related to either Revelle 
or Muir curricula. There will 
be gross amounts of course de-
plication. I fee I that we must 
begin to match up lower divi-
sion requirements. 

Also, I think that we are going 
to have to make some use of 
modern educational technology. 
Maybe if one could listen to 
Harold Urey 00 videotape and 
have a sharp T.A. who could 
answer questions, for example, 
we would be able to stay on 
the frontier of knowledge and at 
the same time do a creditable 
job of teaching. " 

rriton Times: .. Do you think 
that the use of that sort of 
techno!~gy wi 11 turn people into 
mere technicians, more than any-
thing else? Students wlll be 
lectured at, and just wr ite down 
what the professor syas, without 
any real intellectual reflection.· 

McGill: "It's possible but I 
wouldn't Jump to conclusions 
without first seeing how the sy-
stem might be made to work. 
My helief is that there Is nothing 
worse than a rotten lecture de-
livered by a busy professor who 
has no time. Might it not be 
better to have a man devote a 
considerable amount ot time to 
preparing one lecture and then 
record It on taJje? 

Ther e is a certain loss in 
human contact whenever you in-
terpose technology, but I think 
you will have this loss of human 
contact no matter what we do, 
if for no other reason than the 
sheer numbers of stUdents.' 
Triton Times: "Getting away 
from the future development of 
UCSD, what was your feeling 
concerning the Regents' reduc-
tion of the number oC lectures 
to be given by Eldridge Cleaver 
at Berkeley?" 

McGill: "Previously, I have 
tried to refrain from injecting my 
own views, since I believe that 
this would tend to polarize the 
debate, but I do have rather 
strong views on the subject which 
I will now sta te. It's a ver y 
difficult problem. In my view, . 

Dr. 
the Social Analysis 139X was 
an unforeseen outcome of a very 
well intentioned program. It 
provided students and facult y 
members a means to devise 
courses which maybe more rele-
vant to our ever yday lives than the 
traditional academic diSCiplines. 
I believe Berkeley need that kind 
of flexibility due to the academic 
stumness which exists at such 
large universities. 

But the mechanism by w'lich 
such programs are provided 
broke down in this case. I I 
think that as I l1stened to the 
presentation of this course at 
the Regents' meeting last week, 
I was s truck by the impression 
that the argument was clever ' 

but not very convinc ing. To say 
that Cleaver is the s ubject of 
the course rather than the in-
structor of the course seems to 
me to be intellectually dishonest. 
I think the Board of Educational 
Development damaged itself by 
failing to come directly to the 
problem. 

The basic problem is whether 
Eldridge Cleaver is the teacher 
of this course. It seems to be 
obvious that he is. Then there 
is the secondary problem as to 
whether a course constructed in 
that way can be given for cre-
dit, and I think the Regents have 
every reason to be concerned. 

However, nhlnk the Regents 
acted hastily rather than wisely. 
They were under fierce public 
pressure. The atmosphere Is 

hostile and the Cleaver earth-
quake has shown how all of the 
good work that we do goes down 
the drain because we take a lick-
ing in the newspapers. It in-
dicates that the people in this 
country are terribly frightened 
by the transCormations that are 
going on in our SOCiety." 

Triton Times: -But that very fear 
which exists in the nation is in 
itself a good reason for a per-
son Uke Cleaver to be given a 
post where he can educate the 
public. " 

McG1!I: "I don't object to Clea-
ver being given a podium at all. 
I feel that a University must do 
this sort of thing. What irrl-

tates me is the issue of courb'l 
wor k for cr edit in the Univer-
sity. I believe that students 
ought to have to work ver y hard 
for the knowledge they get, and 
there should be no question as 
to its substantive value. I am 
not prepared to guarantee the 
value of Cleaver's lectures." 

Triton Times: "But don't you 
think that you cannot treat such 
a course in traditional ways. 
There is no such thing as an 
academic discipline on racism, 
or any other current problem. 
ThUS, to attack Cleaver's qual-
ifications on tlla basis of a lack 
of any accredited degree is to 
commit the fallacy of logical 
irrele·rance. " 

McGill: "Don't you see that 
when you start talking about ra-
cism you are dealing with ad-
vocacy, rather than the field of 
objective analysis. - I really be-
lieve that more useful approaches 
through history, literature, an-
thropology, sociology, and psy-
chology can be made. I pre-
sume that what is involved in 
Social Analysis 139X is some dis-
cussion of black experience, what 
it feels like to be balck. 

Triton Times: "But there is no 
such thing as an academic back-
ground in black experience.· 

McGill: "Then why does the 
Board of Educational Develop-
ment set up four other professors 
to teach the class? I think it 
would have been far better if 
they had presented It as you 
do--that Clea ver, despite his 
background, was really eligible 
to give that course. I think 
that I would vote against tbat, 
but that is at least an honest 
argument. • 

Triton Times: "You said ear-
lier that the Regents reacted 
to fierce public pressure. When 
Is it necessary to simply ignore 
that sort of thing, and do as 
the University deems best?" 

McGill: "This problem is one 
that cries out for the conditions 
of political stability. In a s ta-
ble society, the UniverSity car-
r ies out its actions within so-
ciety according to certain well 
defined rules. I am working 
toward that sort of mutual un-
derstanding between university 
and community. But we do not 
now have' a stable society. We 
do not have the basis of trust 
of leadership of the University 
necessary for us to conduct our 
affairs. 

We have a suspicious populace, 
enor mously influenced by news-
paper stories which are largely 
distortions. What is newsworthy 
is not very attractive. I am at-
tempting to fight this public pres-
sure brought on by the mass 
media. In the case of Dr. Mar-
cuse, I have refused the pres-
sure of the American Legion, 
and the San Diego newspapers. 
If I were to yield, I would not 
be able to guarantee that the 
University would be worthy of 
its name in the future. 

Recently, the ex-officio mem-
bers of the Board of Regents, 
such as Max Rafferty, have be-
gun to take a great interest In 
the internal affairs of the uni-
versity. As a result, we are 
now deeply involved with poli-
tics . ISOlation of the University 
from politics was the or iginal 
purpose of the Board of Regents, 
and it bas failed. 

I think it is time to consi-
der overhauling the entire Re-
gental system, although I am 
at a loss as to particular alter-
natives. I think that the insula-
tion of the Univer sity from poli-
tics is the most basic problem 
we face. Until we achIeve this, 
we w1l1 be In constant danger 
of gover nmental maraud ln(."

The return of the romance 
in film s is nTlw upon us in

"The Thomas Crown Affair", 
and now the bittersweet tale 
of love "Interlude" have all 
been refreshing and lushly 
beautiful escapes which, al-
though failing to provoke thought 
or develop any degree of com-
plex plot, have nonetheless pro-
vided us with very rewarding 
entertainment. 

"Interlude", a British pro-
duction which recently opened at 
Cinema 21 is perhaps the most 
definitely flawed of the three 
works of art.

Oskar Werner is the brilliant 
young symphony conductor who, 
although married, is caught up 
in a love affair with Barbara 
Ferris , a London society re-
porter. 

The script adeptly pursues 
the usual territory of the tri-
angle: the lighter -than-air be-
ginnings, the frustratlons,fears 
of discovery, guilts, and con-
frontations. But unfortunat~ ly 
we are not emotionally moved 
to care deeply about either lov-
er, and the conclusion oft he af-
fair seems very puzzling in-
deed. 

However, this criticism • 
in no way meant to imply that 
"Interlude" has failed as a wor k 
of romantic art. Its defect~ 
as drama can almost be over-
looked for its sheer beauty. 
Oskar Werner is a fascinating 
Austrian actor and Mis s Fer-
ris is a very lovely and wel-
come British newcomer. 

The photography of Werner's 
country estate istrulyexquisite 
and the film Is drenched in a

Cleaver may lecture. However, 
CPE, which designed Social An-
alysis l39X, is attempting to 
proceed with their original plans 
and attempt to gain credit for 
the students enrolled in the 
course. 

Cleaver lectured this Tuesday, 
and is scheduled to give his se-
cond lecture next week. If he 
does deliver that lecture, CPE 
will be defying a Regents' reso-
lution, and the Registrar at Berk-
eley will be instructed not to 
accept the study list packets of 
students listing 139X for credit. 

The one proposal for imme-
diate action which was adopted 
at the Wednesday night meeting 
was the call tor a march to the 

. registrar's office in Sproul Hall. 
This followed a noon rally on 
Friday in aIUl attempt to havetlle 
registrar accept study lists con-
taining 139X. 

This proposal, which was sub-
mitted by a spokesman for the 
students enrolled in the course, 
also calls for supporters of the 
Cleaver course to join in the 
march. 

Several student s taking the 
course are concerned about tbe 
fact that if the course is not 
accepted for credit they will 
no longer be carrying a minimum 
full-time load, and will be in 
trouble with the Selective Ser-
vice. However, the dean of 
students bas announced that stu-
dents enrolled in the course COUld. 
be granted a waiver by the Col-
lege of Letters and Science, and 
that the UC Selective Service 
office will certify these students 
as having a full academic load.

WATER 
POLO 

"I think we'll be a good team 
for a college our size," said 
Tom Crocker, water polo coacll, 
"and we have a pretty good chance 
of winning at least half of our 
games." 

The bigger colleges will prob-
ably be the major opposition in 
the water polo team 's 14-game 
schedule. 

Of the approximately twenty 
students out for the team, nine 
are returning players . "Besides 
these, we have some good fresh-
men out this year," stated Coach 
Crocker, "and some talented 

tran~er students.' 
As well as can be determined 

so early in the season, the fol-
lowing will be starters this year: 
Dough Cheshire, Andy Elliott, 
Glen Forsch, Hal Handley, Rob 
Kennelly, Byron King, Dave Lis-
cher , Keven McCoy, Pat Smith, 
Dave stillinger and goalie Dennis 
Revie. 

Water polo is a non-contact 
sport wltha seven man team (in-
cluding a goalie). The dimensions 
of the pool (at UCSD) are 25 yds. 
by 16 yds. and at each end is a 
goal 10 feet long by 3 feet high • 

The object is to score tile 
most goals, by throwing the ball 
into the opponents goal. One point 
is given for each goal. 

The game consis ts of four 
seven-minute quarters. Each 
quarter starts with each team at 
their respective end of the pool; 
the referee throwS the ball into 
the middle of the pool and each 
team tries to gain possession to 
start play. 

Tbe bin is moved in two ways: 
(1) dribbling, which consists of 
pushing the ball with your head 
while swimming towards the op-
ponents goal, or (2) passing to a 
teammate, for which only one 
arm may be used. 

The size of the goals at the 
UCSD borne pool (the Natatorium 
on campus) will differ in size, 
however, for the pool gets shal-
lower. To compensate for the 
advantage of the goalie at the 
shallow end, that goal is bigger. 

P.E. Goals 
Outlined 
For Year 

It is tbe function of the De-
partment of Physical Education 
working closely with the faculty 
and admlnlstralior, to bring 
the program of intercollegiate 
athletics into balance and har-
mony with the character of 
UCSD and in keeping with the 
educational values inherent In 
a sound program of competitive 
sports. 

Our staff members are vit-
ally concerned with tile physical 
well-being of all UCSD students 
and are anxious to teach the 
skills of competitive sport s so 
that a lifetime of enjoyment 
may ensue. 

To this end, thirty-seven 
Physical Education activity 
classes are o[[ered in the Fan 
Quarter for 5tudents enrolled in 
Muir and Revelle Colleges. In 
addition, intramural sport s , in-
tercollege competition and in-
tercollegiate athletics will have 
a prominent role In the total 
athletic year *

FOOTBALL 
UCSD elected to break into 

footbalJ on the, varsity level in-
stead of starting on the frosh 
level and working up. This is 
the exception rather than the 
rule nowadays, but it has one 
big advantage: The overly tough 
competition will mold our young 
team into a good team much 
sooner than otherwise. 

'First off, we must be real-
Istic and admit that this is our 
first year of competition,' head 
football coach Walt Hackett be-
gan, 'and we will be underdogs 
in every game we play this sea-
son.' 

Coach Hackel! hopes the team 
will learn something each time 
they play, and be a better team 
for their next game. As Coach 
Hackett says, 'Everything we do 
is new.' 

The team members worked 
hard during their pre- season 
workouts, and are well on their 
way to establis hing a good esprit 
de corps which Coach Hackel! 
desires on all his teams. 

Although UCSD may not win 
many football game s this year, 
fans can expect rapid progress 
In our young team (comprised 
mainly of fre shmen with no col-
lege football experience). 

'We must learn something new 
each game - -' Coach Hackett 
stated, 'setting certain obtain-
able goals and then realizing 
them.' 

The team lost their first game 
to the more experienced La Verne 
team (with 37 out of 40 return-
ing lettermen) 41-6. This was 
to be expected, for the team 
must have ti me to get used to 
each other and the coaches. 

The teams wl1l get tougher 
as the seven-game season pro-
gresses, but with determination 
and hard work, UCSD's fir st 
tootball team may grab some 
upset victories. 

CROSS 
COUN RY 
Cross Country is meant to 

be enjoyable for thEe runners , 
rather than a prolongl'd drudg-
ery of uninspired physical effort. 
To this end the daily practice 
sessions are varied m locale 
and the running pace tailored 
to meet specific goals. There 
is a unique character to cross 
country running which IS quite 
alien to track and fie ld , This 
quality can only be sensed during 
an hour's run over rock- ' rewn 
mesa, or through valley farm-
land, or perhaps along the des-
erted beach at sunset. 

Rather than constrained to an 
oval cinder track in a frenzied 
dash of a few minutes or I s, 
the runner is set loose nto 
the countryside lor a spontan-
eous interaction with his natural 
environment. 

Distance running must go be-
yond enjoyment to justify itself, 
Ilowever. At UC San Diego an 
aggressive competitive at~ itude 
"is encouraged as the pnmary 
driving force of a runner. The 
physical effort is made only by 
exercizing self-reliance and de-
termination. Endurance is the 
outcome,. not a prerequisite. 

Finally, college athletics are 
meant to compliment the acade-
mic development of the student. 
Cross country Is no exceptiun. 
The scholastic progress of the 
student clearly must take pre-
cedence over his running. 0 
meets are scheduled tor a two 
week period at examination time. 
Daily workouts are adapted to 
the student's time and energy. 
Several runners have obtaIned 
tutoring from upper-class It!am-
mates. 

At the same time it is hoped 
that the physical fitness and self 
discipline of a good cross country 
runner will indirectly contribute 
to his academic development.

Language mirrors reality, and 

it is perh11ps for this reason 
that people are very senistive 
a.bOut the way in which some 
words are used. Currently we 
hear the word ·plg" used more 
and more to refer to the po-
lice, and this seems to upset 
a lot of people. I should like, 
therefrore, to examine the mean· 
Ing of the word and the legitimacy 
of its use. 

Heavy Plans 
Light Music 

Shakespeare said that a rose 
by any otlier name would smell 
as sweet. Would it? Suppose we 
call roses stink weeds from now 
on? The fact is that the way in 
which a thing is defined strong-
ly colors the way in which we re-
gard it and respond to it. Cal-
ling Imerialism -fighting to make 
the world free- fools a lot of 
people. We may recall Bertrand 
Russell ' s conjugation of irregu-
lar verbs: I'm firm, you're stub-
bOrn and he's pigheaded, or the 
distinction between our surprise 
attack and their sneak attack. 
The question then is, do these 
men who prowl our streets and ' 
highways deserve to be called 
public servants and peace of-
ficers, or are thse just deceptive 
misnomers? 

An old Bing Crosb'y song goes: 
M A pig is an animal with dirt on 
his face, his shoes are a terrible 
disgrace. He has no manners 
when he eats his food; he 's just 
plain lazy and extremely rude, 
so if you don't care a feather or 
a fig, you may grow up to be a 
pig." What is a pig? What con-
ceptions are conjured up when we , 
hear the word? Apig is an ani- , 
mal that wallows in the mUCk, 
that corrups wht it touches, that 
is greedy and vulgar. U we would 
extend this to include the wUd 
pig, it is also dangerous, un-
predicatble and savage. Certain-
ly this can 't be the definition of 
a peace officer, a public ser-

Clarifies 
vant, one sworn to uphold law, 
order, and justice, sworn to serve 
the interests of the people. But 
does what we normally call .po-
lice" fit this description? 

A blue ribbOn commission in-
vestigating the Columbia affair 
concluded that the student had le -
gitimate demands and the police 
were excessively brutal in quel-
ling them. The commission cur-
rently investigating the Chicago 
riots has already recommended 
acttion be taken against a num-
ber of police. The Presidnet's 
Commission on Riots and Dis-
orders has pointed out that po-
lice brutality is the most ob-
vious manifestation of white ra-
cism. 

The President's Committee to 
investigate police-civilian rela-
tions in San Diego condemned the 
San Diego Police for excesses 
and alienation of the community. 
But do these distinguished voices 
of the establishment have a hear-
ing? No. The crimes and atroci-
ties of these gangsters goes on 
unpunished and unhindered. Tp 
call these pigs public servants 
is like calling skunk-scent per-
fume. Surely this is the double-
think of 1984. 

The commissions, committees 
and conferences of the establish-
ment have condemned the exces-
ses, atrocities and crimes of 
these gestapo. How long can the 
people tolerate this, how long will 
they endure the farce of calling 
these gangsters and hoodlums 
peace officers and public ser-
vants? Call them what theyare--
stop hiding behind the lies of 
flowery official language. U is 
not the criminality and brutality 
that is the exception, it is the 
rule. 

We are no longer surprised to 
see the police swinging clubs at 
the public--we're used to it be-
cause it's no exception: it is the 

"Pigs" 
rule. Why then go on saying that 
tbese gangsters are peace offi-
cers who are occasionally cruel 
and bruatl? Tell it like it is: 
tbese are pigs who occasionally 
display kindness, respect, ser-
vice and courtesy. 

Intimidation, coercion, fear 
and anxiety are the tools oUerror 
not of public servants. And you 
can't deny that we all fee I this 
when the police are around. 
The average up-standing citizen 
was protected from this image. 
Today he, too, Is the victim. 
Century Plaza and Chicago have 
mady many converts when, from 
out of the blue, a riotous horde 
of club-swinging brown shirts 
descended upon them. 

The pigs are not servants of the 
people, they are the servant s of 
the mobsters, the racists, tbe ex-
ploiters and oppressors. just 
as they serve organized crime, 
(when did you last read of a syn-
dicate mobster being arrested?) 
so too do they serve social crime: 
racism, exploitation, oppression. 

Yes, pig is a very appropriate 
word, and it should be used, and 
it will be used until there is a 
change, until the pigs become 
publis cervants. U there isn't 
a change, we had all better read 
Charles Lamb's -Dissertation on 
Roast Pig.'

are to exert any power. They 
must have the audacity to chal-
lange the power structure when-
ever the Black community is 
threatened or when they feel that 
injustices within the society must 
be corrected. And finally they 
must posses the brains to de-
ve lope programs that will lead 
to the creation of ·a Black com-
muntity. 

~wards further feels that any 
whIte hinderance to the creation 
of this communitity must be met 
with force, and that if a mer-
chant refuses to leave the area 
and return to the white section 
he should be burned out. Black 
money should stay in Black neigh-
borhoods Cor Black development. 
Any other way, says Edwards 
is just selling out your communi~ 
ty. While he was on the sub-
ject of the Black community, he 
made the point that while the 
s ymptons are manifested in the 
gbetto, the problem is in tbe white 
neighborhoods. 

By this he means that white 
racism is the driving force be-
hind the disturbances in the ghet-
tos, and that the violence of these 
riot areas is a renection of the 
violence that is sanctified in this 
society. He states that none of 
America's bad habits came from 
Alrica, and that it is American 
SOCiety that has taught its mem-
bers to take what they want. 

On the contrary, he said, 
Blacks must work within the pre-
sent system, but they must do 
so as a unified group. Such 
a group would have leaders re-
sponsive to their needs and would 
act in the same way as other 
special interests groups which 
are already at work within this 
country. 

After the end of his formal 
presentation, Professor Edwards 
hosted an abbreviated question 
and answer period, during which 
he denied that he was in favor 
of setting up a sepera.te national 
political government for Blacks. 

At the end of the questioning 
period, Professor Edwards, who 
is now working on his PhD. in 
SOCiology at Cornell University 
had to forgo the usual informai 
discussion following such lec-
tures because offurtber personal 
commitments.

1872, and All That 
by Angelo William Alaoglu 

During the War of 1812, the 
Army of the Ame r ica.n Republic 
invaded the English colony of 
Upper canada in an attempt to 
liberate the poor oppressed mas -
ses of Englishmen languishing 
under the tyrannous rule of the 
Crown. 

After some success, this grand 
Army was repulsed by regular 
and irregular force" oC Hie; Maj -
esty, at Chrystler ' s Farm, a 
a small town on the st. Law-
rence. 

This little site of little his- _ 
tory, commemorating the second 
and last invasion by the United 
of states, of our friend and fel-
low American democracy, Cana-
da, has been preserved as it 
existed in 1 B35 by the Canadian 
government as a memorial to 
its hardy, self-reliant pioneer 
illS!. 

The American visitor can learn 
that this was a settlement of ' 
United Empire Loyalists, Tories 
to the cas ual scholar of Amer-
icana, and the heavies of the 
American Revolution to John 
Wayne fans. He can discover 
that this town r epresents a par-
adox to the "glory' of Illtrio-
tic, textbook American history. 

One learns of a certain woman 
who was forceably ejected from 
her home and property, during 
the absence of her husband se r -
ving with the armies of His 
Majesty, George m. Without 
trial, or even definite knowledge 
of the eventual outcome of thi! 

l! .)'lm~t, her friendly, God fearing 
Patriot neighbors confiscated all 
of her possessions, e,(c'~i)t 401.1:1-
ket, pillow, sheet and set of 
silver for each memoel' or the 
family, and a single ax, and an 
empty gun. 

Having been prepared to face 
the harsh realities of the fron-
tier, this woman and her chil-
dren were sent off, with tears 
in tbe avaricious eyes of her 
fellow townspeople, to walk to 
canada, another great wilderness 
far to the North. 

And one learns of this town's 
namesake, a certa! n skinflint New 
England type, who owned the 
first farm, the first mill, and 
the nrs~ sltlnnW, me rcal,t\l~, 

capitalist General Store, and who 
eventually became the big man 
who lived in the big, beautiful 
mansion. 

Whatis shocking and intriguing 
.lbOut this collonaded , red brick 
house, is that it compares quite 
favorably with Boston or Wil-
liams:) lrg ,n 1760 or 1735. It 
appears that this man Chrystler 
needed almost fifty years to reach 
a stage that the United states 
had seen 50 years before he 
left. The ' entire town shows 
this 100 year lag, a c red it to 
the generol l~ citizens or thE: new 
Ameril.:ar ';'l1ublic·. fiill1lllLfQr 
freedom of belief and govern-
ment, against an oppressive auto-
cracy, and it explains the warm 
reception that the Canadians gave 
our glorious, liberating Army. 
This town stands as a basic 

~vidence to the birth olthe United 
states of blood. betrayal, hatred, 
fear, injustice, and war 

The American Revolution as 
any other war, forced men to 
kill each other, destroying the 
humanity within themselves. War 
taught the Patriots to disre');>~;i 
human life, and they came to 
accept a certain bestiality of 
action as commonplace, brutali-
zing themselves and their ideals. 

This brutality is part of our 
past, and we should come to ac-
cept and understand it if we are 
to understand bOth ou rselves and 
other men. It is hard for an 
American child to understand 
the Reign of Terror after the 
French Revolution, but he is not 
told that British prisioners were 
held in camps with death rates 
as high as 50 percent. War 
is always brutal, and always will 
be, and we will have to under -
stand tbat the American Rev-
olution was not less brutal than 
others . 

Perhaps this war aDd others 
were necessary, but none of us 
should be proud of having this 
a s part of our past. 

Because war and brutallty are 
all around us, we must come 
to understand it, but we must 
never be proud of U. But the 
basic question that remains is 
'Whether we are going to accept 
brutality and war as necessary 
in the future .

Patton Pleas 
for Peace 

lAst Wednesday, Oct.9,at8:00 
Revelle Commons was preparing 
a dish other than the usual punch-
card specialties. 

Tbe menus, Patton propangan-
da Illmphlets, were surruptit-
ously laid on the tables. in-
evitably the food for thought 
became a real peace meal. 

Within 10 minutes the chairman 
was addressing the audience and 
getting things underway. How-
ever, on a sadder note he had 
to apologize that the side-order, 
the box-office attraction, actress 
Jan Sterling could not be among 
the Illrtakers. The evening sen-
sualism was lost. 

The speaking panel was to con-
sist of Mr. Patton, guest speaker, 
and r epresentatives of Rafferty 
(Rep.) and Cranston (Dem.) for 
the Senatorial race. Unfortuna-
tely, Rafferty submitted no spe-
aker to the feast and to insure 
fair play and equal opportunity 
rights, a United World Federa-
lists' (U.W.F.) spokesman cried 
out for Rafferty's cause. 

Yet, the irony here lay in the 
Cact that Rafferty is against the 
U.W.F. The cry changed from 
non-partisianship to subtle criti-
cism of some of Rafferty' s own 
statements- --whose triviality 
found applause in the chu ckles 
of the crowd. 

U seemed that in every state-
ment, Rafferty was aligning peace 
with education in our grade 
schools. Superflous it was and 
as it turned out, the speaker 
undoubtedly left Rafferty's case 
rest in peace . 

The embellishments oC Raf-
ferty's grave were laid on even 
more harshly and relentlesslyby 
Cranston' s personal speaker. 
"His (Rafferty's) policies are 
assinine, incredible, unbeliev-
able. " 

Whither the particular state-
ments offered were so sever ely 
wretched from context or other-
wise, they seemed like story-
bOok solutions to worldly peace 
and made RafCerty look r idicu-
lous. 

Of course. Crans ton's policies 
which so parallel those of the 
U. W.F., were effectively pre-
sented and equally absorbed by 
the audience. 

An impromptu but interesting 
sidelight, was offered by a re-
presentative olthe Peace & Free-
dom Party who told of how he 
supported McCarthy for awhile, 
and how he is now obviously 
behind Eldrid~ Cleaver. 

James G. Patton, a romantic fig-
gure, a pitch-black patch cover-
ing his left eye, was introduced 
with an adm irable list of cre-
diets: He is: The present Nation-
al President of the WWF, Pre-
sident Emeritus of the National 
Farmer Union (of which he has 
a seniority of 25 years), Presi-
dent of the Inter-American Ag-
rarian Organization (lAO) (fr om 
which will stem the Human Rights 
Congress and an Inter - American 
World Federal Government As-
sociation. 

Patton address ed the audience 
with a father ly air and with the 
experience of his years. In his 
discourse, he was articulate, 
sage, and extremely cool. His 
overall subject matter was the 
humanity and the peace of man 
today and with a r espectable com-
mand of his audience, he was able 
to get his points across . However, 
he left the pamphlets to fill out 
the information on the UWF it-
self: 

·The goal of the United World 
Federalists is a lasting world 
peace v~ a war ld federal govern-
ment, with powe rs limited to 
those necessary for establishing 
and mainta ininglaw and justice on 
a world level. 

Issues to which UWF are par-
ticularly devoted: 

United Nations Charter Revis-
ion, Peaceful Settlement of Inter-
national Disputes, United Nations 
Peacekeeping Machinery, Arms 
Control and Dismarmament, Uni-
versal United Nations Member-
ship, Areas of United Nations 
Jurisdiction, Development of the 
Nurembe rg Principles, Human 
and Civil Rights, Economic and 
Social Development. 

In consummation, with the pow-
er of a half-blind Homer, Pat-
ton struck out a story of peace: 

- Peace today is hindered by 
fear, whose counterpart, hate, 
must be res loved in order to ob-
tain peace wit bout military state-
hood. If man is going to have 
peace, he must go through apsy-
chological change. Man must be 
a universal being in order to acb-
ieve universal peace!' 

Yes, Mr. Patton was far from 
abstract, a sharp contrast to the 
bll.ckdrop of Revelle Commons' 
famed mural, but he was not 
communistic or Utopist in the 
least. He was simple and down-
to-earth in his plea for a pat-
ent on peace.

You can say, Nixon, Nixon, save us, or Meathead Humphrey eat 
us ••• d'ya dig? 

The pollce have developed a caste consciousness. 
These (police) are public servants ••• how arrogant, how contempt-

uous of the people they have become. 
The law is out of order when it starts telling the peop Ie what to do. 
Cops ••• who will beat up young people who come out and say we don't 

like the war, cops who will beat up the politicians and their followers 
who say they want to support Eugene McCarthy ••• are the mercenary 
tools of. •• businessmen, and directed and selected by these avaricious, 
corrupt, demagogical politicians. 

I CHALLENGE RONALD REAGAN TO A DUEL 

The next battlefield after Vietnam is right here in Babylon. 

I wrote a little song today ••• at UCLA ••• it's entitled (censored). 
•.• I want you to repeat it nine times, if you will, if you can tolerate 
the profanity that long ... one, two, three, four: (audience, roaringly: 
-Fuck Ronald Reagan,' for 17 seconds). We dno't wanna talk about 
this too loud, for he might hear this. (NOTE: Inclusion of this passage 
is not to be construed as an assailment of the governor of this state by 

editoriai staff of the TRITON TIMES. It is printed solely for the 
rpose of accurate portrayal of a widely publicized, widely mis-
oted news event.---D.E.) . 

You io,ee a featherwight, teatherbrained, Ughtwelght punk like George 
Wallace 'omlng up from Alabama stutting around the nation talking 
about I'm ~nna solve the Negro Problem. Yeah, he definitely solved 
the Negro problem. We don't have a Negro problem no more, we got 
a Wallace problt!!D' 

MartlD 
him when be was blown away; be 
took nonviolence with him. He 
brought it here, and he tried it, 
to the deatb---andwe 'renotfree, 
so it's gone. 

And we ••• might be wrong ••• 
When I die I migbt find myself 
before the throne of God •• .and 
He may say, Eldridge Cleaver .•• 
you have to got to hell and burn, 
baby, burn ••• and I'll find all of 
you there, I'll find the members 
of the Black Panther Party there, 
and I'll say, let's get it together 
again brother and deal with the 
devil! 

We can't save the world. It 
looks to me like it's all over 
laready, 'cause Curtis LeMay 
had hydrogen bombs on his patrol, 
••. and Lyndon Johnson, that un-
stable motherfucker, has got all 
those buttons. He might wake up 
one morning, no longer thinking 
he's God, but that be's Liberace,

PHOTOGRAPHY, FORMAT AND 
TRANSCRIPTION BY DOUGLAS 
C. EASTON. 

Do you relate to your 'ft(!roes of the past, or are they villains to 
now? Are you cliogingto your dead heroes? ... You are gonna be you .• .. t 

the generation that crea,~es new heroes for the tu ure .. . 

Views expressed by Mr. Cleaver 
do not necessarily represent 
those of the TRITON TIMES. 

There 's going to be an end, a dismatling of the machinery of oppres-
sion or there 's gonna be barbeque in Babylon. We know that this funky, 
raggedy, broken down, corrups, avaricious capitalistic system cannot 
last much longer .. . and we're gonna dis matle this economic system ... 
If you stop to think about the pigs of the power structure ... you have 
the avaricious businessman, the capitalistic bloodsuckin' leech, parasite, 
who might be your mother or father. 

The board of regents has manifested itself to be . .. an instrument of 
oppression on the campuses ... Are you neutral on that? (6 second 
audience response.) 

Give Humphrey so me acid, Nixon some acid, Wallace some acid 
(appaluse). let 'em take a trip and then come back and make some 
speeches so we 'll see if they're still into that reactionary ..• (stuff) 
they're talkin' ~ow. 

There shouldn't be any guns brought on campus either by students .... 
or off-campus people, or by the po licemen •.. Let's take guns, and the 
mace, and those baseball bats off of the campus, and don't be crackin ' 
none of these egg -beads. 

When you tell (the police), man, you didn't h2.ve to shoot that man--
at least you could have shot him in the lelr--they 're gonna shoot 
you for sayin' that. 

The people have no need to stand in fear and trembling of public 
servabts ... If you shoot at us, we're gonna shoot back. 

I know there are many police here tonight because when 1 came 0". 
back tOnight [ heard so many oinks that I started to tell the driver hey 
turn around, I t' s get out 0 ' this pig pen. 

Who would vote not guilty to Lyndon Baines Johnson for the war 
crimies agains t the Vietnamese people? He Wouldn 't get no acquit-
tal ; but he might g6 a hung jury in La Jolla or Orange County. 

We got a big problem. The pigs of the power st ructure are or prob-
lem and .•. all it takes now is to recognize how do we move to the 
barbeque. 

The cryiDg need In America t y Is br Karl Marx to be taken 
out of mothballs and looked at and lI.'l.d ... He had a whole lot to say. ,..If"'...., ....... ALL pOWER TO THE PEOPLE, ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE ..• CAN YOU DIG IT? RIGHT ON!
