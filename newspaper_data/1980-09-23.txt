Moxley resigns 
med school post 
Will stay on UCSD faculty 

John H. Moxley, m, MD, has resigned from his duties as the 
Vice Chancellor for Health Services and Dean ofthe UCSD 
School of Medicine, following a one-year leave of absence from 
the university, to carry on his post as Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Health Affairs. Moxley will retain his UCSD 
faculty position. 

Moxley said that the decision to leave his administrative 
post at the university. was a difficult one. In view of an 

unstable world situation, 
which has required a greater 
demand of his efforts in the 
Department of Defense, he 
feels that he should remain in 
Washington, DC to complete 
his Pentagon tasks. 

Moxley, 45, came to UCSD 
in 1973, five years after the 
School of Medicine was 
founded. During his 
administration the school 
has more than doubled in 
size, student population, and 
medical affiliations. The 
school also attained national 
prominence during his 
administration, and now 
attracts one of the largest 
number of research funding 

John Moxley III awarded to a United States 
medical school. 

Moxley was instrumental in securing close to $30 million in 
federal, state, and local funds for expansion of the School of 
Medicine in La Jolla, and the UC San Diego Medical Center in 
HiUcrest. He oversaw the phased development for the school, 
opening two major teaching facilities, the Clinical Teaching 
Facility at the hospital and the Medical Teaching Facility on 
the La Jolla campus. Moxley also spearheaded the 
development of the Theodore Gildred Cancer Center and 
established a University of California Organized Research 
Unit, which is an umbre))a for all UCSD cancer programs. 

In 1979, Moxley helped obtain a ten-year accreditation for 
the School of Medicine, the maximum period of accreditation 
granted by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. 

Moxley has also been responsible for the establishment of a 
cooperative relationship between the School of Medicine and 
the San Diego medical community. 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson said, "Dr. Moxley's 
resignation as Dean of the Medical School is a real loss to the 
University. Dr. Moxley is one of the top medical deans in the 
country and has been instrumental in building the Medical 
School s international reputation. While I regret his decision, 
I understand the importance of his work to the nation and 
wish him continued success in Washington." 

A graduate of Williams College in Williamstown, 
Massachusetts, Moxley attended the University of Colorado 
School of Medicine graduating in 1961.

ouslng tlg. t t IS year 
but major crisis averted 

BY MARTI WARD 
Searching for housing 

around UCSD is no doubt a 
traumatic experience, and 
this year's scarcity of 
available units and in-
creased rents hasn't helped 

th~ situation. 
But the "crippling" 

housing shortage predicted 
for this year seems 
not to have materi-
alized; the hundreds 
of students who were 
not expected to find 
housing won't be left 
out in the cold. 

Looking around 
the Off Campus 
Housing Office, the 
mad rush to find a 
place to live has 
subsided, but accord- . 
ing to office director Gloria 
Spencer, many students had 
to literally "break the bank" 
to get a roof over their head. 

According to Spencer, a 
student sharing a two 
bedroom apartment with 
one other person can expect 
to pay $170-$200 a month 
plus utilities. The aver~e 
cost of the same housing last 
year was $150. 

In addition, communting 
costs have increased 
drastically. Regular bus far 
is 60 cents and 75 cents for 
the express bus, bringing 
commuting costs for bus 
riders to about $30 a month. 
Drivers can expect to spend 
even more unless they 
carpool. 

"What we lack is affordable 
housing," Spencer says. 

For those students still 
looking for houisng, the 
university operates a 
referral center in the 
Student Center. Office 
house are Monday·Friday 8 
am to 4:30 pm. There are still 
listings available, although 
most students are now 
housed. 

Spencer guesses the off 
campus housing office 
provides services to abou t 
4,000 students a year. As 
well as referrals, they 
provide information about 
leases, repairs and tenant-
landlord reJations. 

Listings are gathered by 
students who can\\ass the 

area, going up and 
down streets talking 
to apartment own-
ers. The office also 
uses the media and 
the Apartment Own-
ers Association to 
collect listings. 

. In addition to high 
...;;.~';:_ rents , students 

- . ' - . _ . sometimes face 
discrimination from 

landlords. This problem, 
however, seems to begetting 
better. "There's not much 
resistance as there was 
originally ," commented 
Spencer, "because the 
students have proven 
themselves to be good 
tenants. " 

Del Mar remains a good 
area for students.

attend the event. 
"He called me in Berkeley 

and first asked me to work for 
Carter's campaign actively, a 
proposal I still he itate to 
accept due to certain personal 
and political i sues," she 
ays. 

"Then I wa invited to the

considering attending the 
debates, was that his podium 
display the presidential seal 
- that mark of legitimacy 
and authority. 

However, Anderson's 
problem is that his speech 
seems permanently stuck in 
the "strident" mode. The 
man could not call room 
service without sounding 
self·rightous. Reagan, on the 
other hand, has mastered the 
craft of calm assurance, 

tion, with the end result that 
he seems rather pompous and 
overblown. 

Somewhere after the 
middle of the debate, 
somebody must have 
whispered in Anderson's ear 
when he was off-camera that 
he had better mellow out 
quickly or he will never 
become president. All of a 
sudden, Anderson started 
speaking in calm and 
measured tones, and 
outshining Reagan - the 
media candidate to beat all 
media candidates - at his 
own game . 

Therefore, any evaluation 
of debating skills is 
superfious. The debates are 
not so much an opportunity

years old shortly after 
maugaration, plays the role 
of the caJmly reassuring

the "difficult" questions 
presented by the panel of

would cut taxes), his 
intellectual shabbiness was 
highlighted. 

to mmpare the stands of the 
candidates as a chance to 
compare their images. In the 
Reagan/Anderson debate 
Sunday night, Anderson 
clearly was the winner in 
matters of substance. In a 
morning-after reading of the 
text of the debate, one can see 
that at least 50 percent of 
Anderson's sentences made 
grammatical sense, which

soundin~ much more 
"presidential," and frankly, 
much saner. 

In t he first half of the 
debate, I found myself 
impressed by what Anderson 
had to say, but was turned off 
by his belligerency. ] found 
myself thinking, over and 
over, that with a few valiums 
this man could become leader 
of the free world. Anderson is 
also enamored of over· 
complex sentence construe· 

regarding the oil shortage 
and the conservation of 
natural resources, he calmly 
responded that ther~ really 
was no problem. and that 
things would take care of 
themselves. Although this 
flies in the face of logic and 
intuition, when said with 
authority and the simplicity 
of wisdom, all doubt 
vanishes. Reagan takes us to 
his knee, and rocks us to a 
calm, unworried sleep. 

Reagan's concluding 
remarks consisted of a 
relentlessly maudlin pep-talk 
on the greatness of America 
that sounded more like a 
hyper'bolic parody of 
unthinking knee·jerk 
patriotism. It was so bald an 
attempt to ally himself with 
our nationalist stirrings, that 
I am sure that even Nancy 
Reagan must have grimaced. 
By the end of the debate, 
despite a hard·sell appeal for 
votes by Anderson that was 
more than a little grating, it 
was clear that Anderson had 
won by a nose.

Iran, Iraq escalate 
to full scale war 

Iraqi warplanes struck at 
more than a half·dozen 
Iranian air installations 
yesterday including Teh· 
ran's international airport, 
and Iran claimed success in 
retaliatory raids on two Iraqi 
air bases. Iraqi state radio 
said three of weeks of 
hostilities over a vital 
Persian Gulf water route had 
"escalated into a full·scale 
war." 

Iran and Iraq have sparred 
along their borders for 
months, but the fighting 
burgeoned last week after 
Iraq canceled a 1975 treaty. 

Iraq said its warplanes hit 
11 airstrips and it lost two 
Soviet·made MiG jets. A top 
Iranian military official said 
"several" air bases were 
attacked, and an Iranian 
revolutionary guard com· 
mander said six MiGs raided 
seven installations. 

Iran's American· made 
fighters struck back with 
bombing raids on Iraq's 
Waset Province 100 miles 

east of Baghdad and on 
Basra, Iraq'.s southernmos.t 
port, accordmg to communt· 
ques from Iran and Iraq. 

Thick smoke rose over 
Tehran's Mehrabad Airport 
yesterday and the thunder of 
the midday attack rocked the 
capital. Citizens were told to 
remain calm and ignore all 
but official reports of the 
fighting. The country was 
under blackout orders to 
guard against night air raids, 
according to Tehran Radio. 

Iran declared its coastal 
waters a war zone and said it 
would not allow any 
merchant ship to carry cargo 
to Iraqi ports, according to 
Tehran Radio. The report 
prescribed a shipping route 
and said it would not be 
responsible for those who 
violated it. 

Iraqi media carried 
unconfirmed reports that 
Iranian artillery fired on five 
foreign cargo ships.

Tuesday, September 23, 1980 The Daily Guardian 

New health plan for UCSD staff 
A unique health services 

plan for UCSD campus and 
Medical Center employees 
has passed the last of many 
hurdles and will get 
underway this fall . 

The new Health Services 
Program officially will begin 
Jan. I, 1981. on a yearlong 
pilot program basis. 

Participation durin~ that 
pilot period will be limIted to 
1,000 employees, selected at 
random by computer from all 
applicants. 

Basically, the program 
means UCSD career em· 
ployees and their dependents 
can receive the majority of 
their health care at little or no 
out-of· pocket costs. 

Under the program, 
payments by the employee 's 
insurance carrier will be 
supplemented by University 
funding of the deductible and 
co- insurance for which the 
employee would normally be 
responsible if: 

-the service is provided at 
the UCSD Medical Center 
facility by UCSD physicians. 

-The employee is enrolled 
in University s ponsored 
Prudential or Blue Cross 
insurance programs or have 
another comparable insur· 
ance plan. (Kaiser enrolees 
are not covered by the new 
plan since they must receive 
their care at a Kaiserfacility.) 

In an expansion of her role 
as employee health coordina· 
tor in the Family Medical 
Center, Donna Mills has been 
appointed coordinator of the 
Health Services Program. 

She said a detailed 
explanation and application 
forms will be sent to all 
employees from Sheldon S. 
King, director of University 
Hospital and Clinics, and Dr. 
Wigbert Weiderhold, chair· 
man of the Executive 
Committee, on Friday. 

Additional explanation 
will come in meetings 
scheduled on the general 
campus, the Medical Center 
and Kearny Annex between 
Oct. 1 and 15, when officials 
will further outline the 
program and answer 
questions. 

Oct. 24 is the deadline for 
employees to return the 
application forms indicating 
they wish to participate in 
the pilot group. The 
computer then will randomly 
select 1,000. 

Participants will receive 
notification by Oct. 31 of 
their selection for enrollment 
in the yearlong pilot program 
starting Jan. 1. 

"If participating in HSP 
would mean that you would 
have to, or want to, change 
your current insurance, 
please wait until you have 
received written verification 
that you have been selected 
as one of the 1,000 pilot 
participants," Mills says. 

director of University 
Hospital , headed by Vincent 
Wayne, deputy director, and 
included departmental 
chairpersons and key 
admini strative s taff . The 
result of their work was the 
first such program in the UC 
system, later approved by the 
Regents and UC President's 
office. 

Administrations of both 
the campus and Medical 
Center support the program. 

Among advantages of the 
program to employees and 
their dependents are: 

-The UCSD Medical 
Center provides a full range 
of health services repre· 
senting nearly all subspeci· 

alities of medicine. Primary 
care physicians, as well as 
many different subspecial· 
ists ., are available. 

- The Medical Center has 
at its disposal some of the 
most advanced medical 
technology available - a 
combination of highly 
trained and skilled staff and 
so phisticated medical 
equipment. 

-Medical services for the 
entire family are conven· 
iently obtained in one 
medical center complex. 

-And the bottom line, of 
course - the majority of an 
enrolled family's health care 
will be provided with little or 
no out·of·pocket expense. 

Linda sees Jimmy 
continued from pale J 
performed "very well" . in 
last night 's " town 
meeting," his 27th since 
the beginning of the 
campaign season. 

"After he was intro-
duced by (California 
Governor) Brown, Carter 
gave a short speech about 
the faith he has in the 
American people and the 
strength and spirit they 
would show in a crisis 
situation," Sabo says. She 
says she believes Carter's 
s in cerity is genuine, 
despite his faults. 

The President than 
fielded questions from the 

aUdience, 95 oercent of 
whom were Torrance 
residents who gained 
admission through a 
random selection process. 
Issues including defense 
spending, the draft and 
registration, education 
and the hostage situation 
were dealt with handily by 
Carter, Sabo says. 

"While I disagree with 
Carter on issues such as 
registration and how 
active he's been for women 
and minorities, I haven't 
found a candidate I 
completely agree with 
since George McGovern," 
Sabo says. 

Michael Stringer, associate 
director in charge of the 
program's administration, 
noted that the pilot year will 
allow the Medical Center to 
evaluate the impact that the 
additional demand for service 
will have on its operation and 
staffing levels . 

Now comes Millertime. 
The pilot phase also will 

provice the Center with 
sufficient experience to 
identify changes that need to 
be made in order to extend 
the program to all employees 
in 1982, he said. 

An ad hoc committee 
which developed the pI'OI1'IJIl 
was appointed by the dean 01

Coffee: 'Good to the last drop' 
~"'fIom.-.e2 
tea drinking, but its not, 
well, American, and tea just ~oesn't have the same 
psychological and tradi-
tional appeal. More on this 
later, maybe.) 

I've been accused of 
"adulterating" my coffee 
with cream and sugar. 
There is some truth to that, 
and it does disturb me. After 
a1I,1 consider myself a coffee 
purist. I usually reply that 
such "adulterants" mlIa1lC' 
the flavor of coffee for me, 
just as salt and pepper or 
mustard and ketchup 
contribute to the taste and 
enjoyment of different foods. 
Aesthetics is part m the 
scienc:le of sensory percep-
tion, eood taste is an ~ive oonception, I;nd ~he 
aealve act IS subjective 
execution. But the philOlC> 
phicaI demelne of Aesthetics 
_ heavy, polemical, 80 
let', stress here the 

psychology of appreciation 
and preference: Coffee tastes 
better to me with cream and 
a bit of sugar. 

But then I do, out of 
propriety and principle, 
drink Hennessey cognac 
straight and not mixed with, 
say, cola, for that would be a 
base and ignoble act. Fearing 
the perils of paradox and 
inconsistency, I take 
comfort in the fact that 
others', even men of 
greatness, have seen fit to 
adulterate their coffee. And 
their list goes on. 

The exacting stylist 
Gustave Flaubert, for 
example, was a happy 
addict . Immanuel Kant 
drank it all the time while he 
w. quietly revolutionizing 
philosophy. The decadent, 
satanic Baudelaire was a big 
fan, coffee ranking right up 
there with his alcohol and 
opium. And Bach even wrote 
a whimsical tribute to the 

beveral{e, the "Coffee 
Cantata. ' 

Balzac. probably the 
greatest coffeephile of all, 
used to drink 20 to 30 cups of 
his special strong brew 
every day which, I read 
somewhere, adds up to 
around 50,000 cups during 
his lifetime. He once wrote 
something about his favorite 
beverage which says it all: ' 
"Hardly have I drunk coffee 
when everything falls into 
place. Thoughts come 
flooding like battalions of a 
great army on the battle-
field." 

And that's how it is. In the 
meantime, I continue 
looking for the Perfect Cup, 
one that looks just right and 
feels good and warm in the 
hand - something, I 
imagine, like the 18th 
century porcelain vessel, 
popular in the French court, 
modeled after Marie 
Antoinette's bosom.

the lighting and stage 
fixture. 

The cost of completing the 
fixtures is estimated at 
$700,000, says Victoria 
Spencer, management 
service officer of the Drama 
Department. 

Funding for the theater is 
being provided in whole by 
the Theater and Arts 
Foundation of San Diego 
County, with the stipulation 
that they have use of the 
facility during the three 
months of summer break. 
Funds for the equipment, 
Spencer says, are being 
raised through a joint effort 
between the foundation and 
the Drama Department. 

Bob Thorburn, associate 
campus architect, says that 
the new theater will be "a full 
blown facility, just the right 
size for a professional 
theater."
