I F you're one of those srudents who manages to gain entrance to UCSD on 
the merit of a more or less 
respecrable SAT score or w!th a 
so-so high school GPA. you can 
thank your lucky srars - (or 
your parents) - that you weren't 
born a few years later. Had you 
been , you probably wouldn't have 
been admined to the University 
of California system. Because of 
an increase in the number of 
applicants to the UC system, as 
well as a change in the 
application processing policy, 
the UC system has become 
significantly more selective in 
screening freshmen application 
for admission . Thi mean that 
th usands of ehgible students are 
turned away each year from the 
UC system, while man of the 
campuse are becoming over-
enrolled . 

Under the new application 
filing system, which was initiat d 
in the fall of 1986, an applicant

equal consideration for 
admission . The campus choice

SDSU student 
newspaper protested 

Seven thousand San Diego 
State student newspapers were 
sealed shut Monday by women 
protesting the Aztec's acceptance 
of advertisements from Playboy 
magazine and erotic phone 
message services. 

Lori Saldana, a graduate 
student and volunteer for SDSU's 
Women Resource Center said 
that The Aztec's advertiSing policy 
is offenSive and insulting to 
women . According to Saldana, 
sex-oriented advertising 
contributes to violence against 
women on campus. 

The stickers were folded over 
the edge of the paper which 
forced reade rs to tear the seal 
open to view the inside pages. 

Some of the stickers read 
"SDSU Women Say No to 

Playboy." while thers read 
"PLayboy and This Aztec Insult 
Women ." 

Bd re placmg the sti kers on 
the newspapers, Saldana spoke 
wi th campus police to ensure the 
legality of the acti on . 

R. Andrcw Rathbone. editor of 
the paper, said he was irritated 
by the protest and perplexed 
wh y so muc h effort and time 
had been expended on the 
protest. 

Playboy magazine began its 
four day recruitment of SDSU 
women willing to pose for the 
magaz ine's photographers 
Monday. 

UC makes pact 
with NASA 

The Universlty of California 
and the ASA-Ames Research 
Ce nter have reached an 
agreement to share technical 
capabilities. facilities, and 
personnel for researc h and 
education in the increasingly 
Important field of nonlinear 
science. 

Representatives of the 
University and NASA-Ames will 
sign a "memorandum o f 
understandll1g" to formalize the 
agreement at an eremony at 
Ames on February 24. 

The pac t will estabh£h the

collaborative research , 
opportunities for doctoral and 
post-doctoral students to work 
on scientific projects at Ames.

series. conferences and summer 
schools. and the rapid exchange 
of information . In addition, UC 
researchers will have access to 
Ames' highly sophisticated 
supercomputers. 

According to Henry Abarbanel. 
a research physicist at the 

Unive~ity of California, San 
Diego and acting chair of UCs

Second bomb threat 
in three weeks 

A threat was received by the 
Dean's Office of the Basic 
Science Building (BSB) yesterday. 
claiming that a bomb would be 
detonated at 12 that afternoon , 
police said. 

No explosives were found after 
a searc h of the area and nobody 
was evacuated from the building. 

"This is the second bomb 
thr;eat in three weeks that BSB 
has had ," said Sergeant Robert 
Jones of the UCSD police. 

Neither threat was camed out. 
"It sounds like we have ' 

somebody who is disgruntled 
about someone at BSB: Jones 
said. 

Jones also said that although 
there have not been any other 
threats in the last couple of 
year~ . they used to be common 
occurences around l nals time by 
students trying to postpone their 
finals . 

.Despite "all the t' reats we've 
had over the years Ie have 
never had one go ." Jones

The university does not

"The purpose of the lab is to

other speakers at the forum . who 
said that lab officials had subtly 
lobbied against a proposed 
nuclear freeze and for the 
development of the neutron 
bomb and President Reagan's 
Strategic Defense Initiative. 

In addition, lab officials who 

say continued testing of nuclear

Critics also said that the lab

'The university performs a

Several critics used the forum 

to urge the passage of a 
comprehensive ban on nuclear 
testing. 

Richard Garwin . a physicst 
and adviser to the past six 
presidents, urged the adoption of 
a ban on testing, which would 
prevent the development and 
deployment of new weapons. 

"But the old weapons will still 
exist ," he said . "A test ban does 
not mean that our weapons will

may hasten the day when we

Subcommittee discusses plan 
for prepaying college tuition 
By SHERYL NELSON. UC Santa Barbara, SlaJJ Writer 

A state Assembly subcommittee 
discussed proposed legislation 
offering parents the opportunity 
to prepay college tuition for 
California's universities at a 
special hearing Feb.lO . 

The Educational Security 
Account Act . curremly in the 
planning stages, would aUow 
parents to prepay tuition by 
investing in a tax-free account to 
be managed by the state. Prepaid 
tuition guarantees future fees will 
be completely covered, regardless 
of fee increases. 

A provision in the bill will be 
added to ensure a refund of an 
fees, with interest , if the child 
does not attend one of the 
sc hools covered by the tuition 

payments. 
State Assemblyman Tom 

Hayden , D-Santa Monica, a 
University of Michigan graduate, 
initiated the legislation in the 
state Assembly. "Increasing 
educational COStS coupled with 
runaway student debt rates have 
necessitated creative alternatives 
to financing a college education ," 
said Hayden , chai r of the state 
Assembly Subcommittee on 
Higher Education. 

"Parents need to know that a 
college education is sull 
attainable , that they will be able 
to afford to send their kids to 
college In the yea r 2020 ," he 
co ntinued. "No matter how much 
the cost of an education rises, 

the student's tuition expenses 
will be picked up ." 

The state of Michigan enacted 
lhe Ba::calaureate Education 
System Trust earlier this year, 
creating the first state-sponsored 
prepaid college education fund 
in the nation and sparking the 
move for the program in the 
nation and sparking the move 
for the program in California. 
The architects of the Michigan 
bill. Gov. John Blanchard and 
Treasurer Robert Bowman, 
attended the hearing to help 
remodel the proposal for 
California.

4 Thursday, Februal) 19, 1987 

An occupational hazard named Duke 
Workers have a right to cX'jJect 

a safe environment at their 
places of employment. But 
apparently Gov. George 
Deukmejian doesn't thtnk o. 

After three years of weakening 
Califomia's worker safety 
program, the governor IS now 
proposing to dismantle altogether 
Cal-OSHA, the model State 
agency which operates tn place 
of the less effectlve federal 
Occupational afety and Health 
AdmtniSlration. 

In keeping with hIS skinflint 
Image, the "Duke" hopes to save 
a paltry $8 million of his $39 

billion budget by transferring the 
responSibility of worker safety to 
the federal government, which 
prese ntly lacks the resources and 
manpower to do even a 
marginally adequate job. 

An outraged Attorney General 

john Van de Kamp accuratd}' 
charges that "what the govemor 
IS propOStng IS nothing less than 
a lethal game of bu k-passing. It 
would send a message of 
IIldlfference bordering on 
contempt to CalifornIa's worktng 
men and women ." 

In former GOV. jerry Brown's 
last year tn oITtce, (fiscal year 
1981-82), Cal-OSHA completed 
1,214 preventive safety 
tnspections, By 1984-85, 
however, Cal-OSHA conducted 
only 321 such inspecttons, a 400 
percent decrease from 1981-82. 
And in the general building 
constmction tndustry, which 
employs over 140,000 
Californians among 15,600 firms, 
Cal-OSHA in 1985 did only eight 
safety inspections. That year 
10,418 persons employed in this 
industry suffered tnjuries, many 

were permanently maimed , and 
some were even killed. In 1983 
DeukmeJian fired 83 staff 
members of Cal-O HA, and the 
follo\ving year he ordered a 
hIring freeze . Overall, III 
Deukmejian's first term in office, 
work related Injurtes increased 
more than 20 percent as Cal-
o HA's on-site inspectlons 
decreased by 74 percent. The 
governor's anti-worker record is 
appalling, Coincidentally, 
DeukmCJian received $8 million 
in political contributions for his 
reelection campaign from big 
business, Consequently, it is 
hardly surprising that the 
governor now wants to shut Cal-
OSHA's doors for good, despite 
the overall inferiority of the 
federal government's worker 
safety program, 

While California, for example , 

regulates worker safety in oil 
drilling, logging and the 
onstruCtlon industry, the federal 

government offers "little or no 
protection ," repons Van de 
Kamp. Worse yet, federal 
authorities have prosecuted Just 
14 cases in 15 years compared 
to California's record of over 200 
prosecutions in 10 years. In 
addi tion, the federal OSHA can 
only inspect about one percent 

of the natlon 's 5.5 million work 
places each year. 

Unless Califomla's labor 
untons and elected 
represe ntatives can pressure the 
governor to reverse hi s positton , 
California Medical Associatton 
spokesmiln Tim Shannon 
expects 'There will be less 
regulation, less enforcement and 
probably a higher increase III 
worker injuries" in the future.

assan, a ThIrd College sentor, 
pointed out that "Peyer has not 
been found gUIlty yet, but 
everyone IS already condemntng 
him; it's tOO bad." 

Sassan admitted, however, 
'They'd have to have some good 
eVidence to arrest a cop." 

Regardless of whether Peyer is 
mnocent or guilty, the publiC has 
been painfully reminded that, as 
Muir senior Wayne said , "Cops 
a're people too. We can't truSt 
them blindly." 

Another Muir senior, Ben, 
saId , "It has made me reahze 
there are good reasons for not 
obeying a policeman in cemlll 
Situations. 1 wouldn 't dnve to a 
secluded area at night if [ 
couldn't see a good reason to." 

Karen, a Third College 
sophomore, remembered a 
bumper sticker she once saw 
that saId: "Question Authority," 
and she said that the Peyer case 
has made her take these words 
more seriously. 

Warren freshman Paul po lilted 
out, lrontcally, that when a JUry 
is being chosen for Peyer's trial , 
each prospective jury member 
wlll probably be asked If he or 
she belteves everything a 
policeman says. 

"What's really scary is that she 
I Cara Knott ! was so careful ," 
Karen said , "She had taken rape 
preventton and self-defense , and 
she called ahead to tell her 
parents she was leaVing Ifor theIr 
housel and it still wasn't enough. 
I'm scared . 

"]'m also angry. just because 

"Cops are people too. We can't trust 
them blindly." 

-Muir senior Wayne 
Peyer tndlctmentl happens, 
What am I.supposed to thlllk?" 

Eva, a Revelle sophomore, 
suggested that "An organization 
hke the CHP should have some 
kind of ongoing mental health 
program for ItS officers. I've 
known some guys who've wanted 
to become cops who were sorry 
they missed VIetnam. I know 
nobody's perfect, but if you carry 
a gun , you should be ." 

I'm a woman , I can't go out alone 
at mght It takes my freedom 
away from me , 

"I'm gomg to a cla!>s LOnight 
that WIll license me to use Mace . 
Can you believe It? I gotta carry 
Mace!" 

Mace IS the trademark of an 
aerosol weapon that temporanly 
blind!> and paralyzes anyone 
who e face is exposed to It. 1 he 
thought of uStng It agatnst ,;l law 

enforcement officer is a 
frightening irony, 

Still , as Sassan pOinted out, 
"You can't distrust the system, 
The system has a lot of 
problems, but you ca n't distrust 
it. ThIS ktnd of thing happens 
sometimes." 

If anarchy is the altemative to 
a law enforcement system, then 
we truly must truSt the system, 
and we must hope, as"graduate 
studem Nina did, that "ThiS is 
just an isolated case. 

"It makes you think twice, 
though ." 

Indeed it does. And it forces 
us to swallow the bitter truth 
that , as April put it, "Policemen 
aren't God" ~

Conscientious objection 
Editor: 

I \Va . n t greatly surpn~rd b} 
the GlIa,.dlllll 's February 17 cover 
story, The statements of I.:nL 
WeISS, our AS. Vice PreSIdent 01 
EXlemJI Affairs - "our 
representative" - IllumInate the 
growll1g tift tn twO perceptIons 
of the purpose of student 
govemment. Student wage , 
afflrmattve Jctton. lack of 
parktng, the Reagan 
Adml ntstratlons's ftnanclal aId 
cuts, and lots 0' beer are 
Important, and issues such as 
the u .S. supported (with our 
money) coven war in icaragua 
are not quite as important. 

According to Weiss, politics 
and government no longer exist 
in the same domain. WP.iss was 
quoted as saying, 'These are 
important issues, but it doesn't 
mean they directly affect 
students as students." Does this 
mean that when ['m a student 
['m not being a conscientious 
U.S. citizen or vice versa or 
what? 

Let's take a look at the 
decision by the University of 
California Student Association to 
support student opposition to 
U.s. involvement in Nicaragua. 
The fact that our ASUCSD voted, 
with the minority, against 
supporting student political 
panicipation isn't really 
representative of UCSD students 
at large. 

What is the purpose of a 
university? Is it to train young 
minds to perfectly memonze and 
then regurgitate past knowledge? 
I don't thtnk so. The university, 
in its purest conceptualization, is 
a meeting place for free thinkers. 
A place where ideas can be 
exchanged and new thoughts 
developed. Students at the 
university such as ourselves, are 
here to develop a foundation 
upon whieh to create the future . 

If we are going to leave thIS 
campus wIth an ability to be 
leaders out in the commUntty, we 
had better be aware that each of 
us as <In indIvIdual can actually 
make a dIfference out there One 
thing I absolutely III 1St that 
student government accomplish 
on thIS Cilmpus 1'; to foster that 
brhef III all students 

What arc the possibllittes of 
student government) tudent 
government can be a center of 
organizatton and resources for 
studertts to come tOgether on 
this campus and reahze the 
potential of themselves as a body 
of people capable of organizing 
large campuswide events, 
encouraging diverse ideas and 
communication through the 
medias, obtaining successful 
hands-on experience with 
cooperative student-run 
businesses, learning to effectively 
organize with other student 
bodies and developing the 
initiative to go OUt and be 
powerful leaders in the world . 

Another issue is: does U.S. 
coven military intervention in 
Nicaragua constitute a relevant 
student issue? Somehow, the 
view of the U.s. promoting its 
"righteous" democracy across a 
planet of "undesirables," 
"communists," and "terrorists" 
just doesn't have the same 
durablitity it used to - at least 
around a somewhat better 
informed public like ourselves. 
With a negative balance of trade, 
the spread of nuclear weaponry 
and the decline of u.s. 
hegemoniC power, people in the 
u.s. (that's you and me despite 
the fact that we are also 
students) are going to have to 
own up to the realities of what 
we've done in the past and what 
we continue to do today to 
maimain economic advamage on 
the planet.

Fences and flowers 

Editor: 
I admit It I hke the lead trees. 

I even have a cenain affection 
for the Sun God , in aU her 
brightly painted asymetrical 
splendor. Stili, the Stuan 
Collection seems not quite wonh 
its mIllions. From the monoliths 
in Revelle tc the TV Buddha at 
Third, we have a wonderful 
assonment of interesttng 
creations. They're little more than 
that, however. With all due 
respect to Mr. Desilva, I think 
we'd be hard pressed to call this 
one of the world's greatest an 
collections. 

In the Media Center, for 
example, [ always feel strongly 
compelled to shut off each of 

am June Paik's 24 television 
sets. Perhaps it's my own artistic 
immaturity, but this arrangement 
of sets strikes me as being only 
mildly more Impressive than the 
one I might see at Sears or 
Federated . I can pmpoint rwo 
reasons for this feeling. FIrSt, I'm 
confident that my little brother 
could have conceived of this 
structure; I find art more pleasant 
when I'm impressed with the 
skill required to make it. Second, 
in this institution of higher 
leammg, I can't help but 
recognize the great scientific 
achIevements that gave us what 
we have today. tanding ·in the 
shadows of men brilhant enough 
to create televisions. men 
bnlllant enough to stack 
televiSIOns pale in comparison. 

Two Running Violet V-forms, 

Itkewlse, IS among the least 
I m press Ive a rt I've eve r 
encountered. I'm eve n surpnsed 
that Ms McCleary refers to it as 
a sculpture. After only a qUIck 
layman 's mspectlon of the 
"artwork ," I concluded that Mr. 
lrWII1 dId not stngle handedly 
construct It, rather he probably 
conce Ived II and left the actual 
sculpti ng to an expenenced 
fenCIng company. At best, he 
might have planted the small 
purple flowers that trace under 
the net. Stili, though, the 
question remains: does this 
unique and contrasting unton of 
the diSCIplines, gardening and 
fencmg, qualify as an? Agam [ 
fi nd that the "anist" in no way 
demonstrated a special skill or 
creative ability. So although [ 
ha ve no true rancour for the 
fence , I do fail to see how it, or 
the trees or even the televiSIOn 
sets, could inspire enough zeal 
in Ms. Beebe to describe the 
project ove r and over again with 
adjectives like "challenging," 
"daring," and "eXCiting." There 
may. however, be more to these 
seemingly simple Structures than 
one would imagine. After all, 
Beebe does go on to say of the 
purple fence , "This structure 
serves as a focus of space, light 
and form." Since neither I nor 
any of the people I've asked 
know exactly what this means, I 
cannot fully discount the 
possibIlity that it somehow Justly 
warrants all the praise that this 
uncommonly ftne fence has 
received. But [ doubt it. I would 
even go so far as to say It was 
probably not trees being lead 
plated , violet screens being 
erected, and televisions being 
stacked that lured Ms. Beebe 
from Oregon. The millions of 
dollars to be spent on an at 
UCSD most likely played some 
part in her deCISIOn . 

We should strtve to keep our 
an and the prices of tndividual 
projects m perspective. With

Football farce 

Editor: 
Your excellent anicle on the 

possibilities of football at UC D 
should excite some student 
interest III the subject. Bur in 
addition to the cautions voiced 
by those intetviewed, I would 
add the possibilities of problems 
that football brings to any 
campus. I was III college in the 
1960s and consequently have a 
social bias against "rah-rah" 
activities: they have always been 
a reminder of the authoritarian 
personalities that ran my high 
sc hool and who carefully 
channeled adolescent energies 
into "school spirit" with its 
hierarchy of jocks, cheerleaders, 
etc, But this may be a generation 
interested 111 returning to the 
tranquil 1950s, that is, one that 
wams to reconstruct such 
hierarchies and patterns of 
conformity, Let me, for the sake 
of brevity, assume that IS true , 

Aside from worrying about the 
demands that football impose on 
university facilities and how that 
might cut into the already 

\ underfunded programs of 
intennural and intercollegIate 
athletics, students should also 
ask what they will get in 
addition to football , The campus 
is becoming increaSingly 
successful in drawing alumni 
into activities here , from actual 
involvement in programs to 
raising money for the school. But 
football tends to draw alumni 
who often have little interest in 
anything else: they want a 
winning team, and a good, boozy 
time; and they are loud with 
their demands on administrators 
to get both, And as more alumni 
get involved . they make theIr 
contributi ons to the campus 
ontingent upon getting their 

way: they introduce distortion 
in campus salarie~, student jobs, 
athletic f..lcihties. throughout the 
campus, There is currently a 
debate with1l1 the academiC 
communllY as to whether such 

dl ~tomOn~ are wonh the 
supposed benefns of football , I 
refer here not only to the 
recurrent <;eandals of r('cnlltment 
at major sc hools, but the less-
public Ized abu'>C of athlete,> who 
arc admitted as jocks, used for 
the duration ollhelr eligibility , 
and then kicked out without a 
degree, The more one looks at 
the abuses associated w!th thiS 
"spon," the more obvious it 
becomes that football renects a 
very peculiar value system, But if 
football IS thar Important to 
students. they hould pay their 
'1>5 and see what they get. But 
they should not delude 
themselves with the thought -
to pamphrase political 
consetvatives - that there is any 
such thlllg as a cheap 
"homecoming," 

The campus badly needs 
actlvltics that will draw students 
and other members of the 
university together - but it is a 
sad comment on the imagination 
and mtiuative of the entire 
uni versity when football seems 
the best remedy to an atomized 
society.

continued "The concept IS

there is a need for such a

continue supporting financial

Hayden said 

"We must mallltain our strong

The main theme of the

immigrant experience, 
educational rights and on

The eve nt, though 
concentrated on serious matters, 
is sc heduled to end with a light 
note as it will be blended with ' 
an ans and cultural program and 
capped ofT by a dance pany, 

According to Samoa Koria , a 
member of the APSU 
coordinating committee and a 
keynOte speaker, the conference 
will tackle the main theme by 
diViding it inro two pans -
Jiving in America and the 
question of it being "indeed the 
land oi opportunity." He stated 
that the discrepancy in 
opportunity could be shown by 
how the Asians are stereotyped 
as being academically successful 
or as the model minority creating 
resentment and discrimination , 
emphasized by the increase of 
75 percent in incidents of 
violence against them, 

Another sample issue would be 
the pressures upon Asian 
students coming both from home 

as well as from their studies, 
Koria CIted that thiS generally 
creates a situation where the 
student just wants to survive 
sehool. get a diploma and get a 
job to help his family, Through 
the conference, he hopes that 
such narrow dimensional 
eXistence In school life among 
Asian students will be brought to 
attention and that, pOSSibly, 
options and solutions wi)) be 
sought out 

The APSU , fonned in April of 
1978, is an organized body 
consisting of close to 35 campus 
organizations from universities 
and colleges such as UCSD, 
SDSU, UCLA, UC Berkley, 
Stanford U, and Cal State Long 
Beach, It was fonned as a 
network for ASian-American 
slUdents at a time when the 
educational system was not 
addressing their concerns, The 
union aimed at meeting the 
cultural. social, political and 

educational needs of Asian· 
Pacifie Islander students 
through the sharing of ideas 
resources and experiences, 

The conference has been held 
in Northern California for the 
last eight years. Last year's 
conference was held at San 
Fmncisco State, As Sev 
Magbuhat, a four-ume APSU 
conference attendee said, the 
Asians and Pacific [slanders in 
Southern California have been 
given the stigma of being laid 
back and umnvolved with the 
issues, By holding the conference 
in San Diego, APSU is hoping 
that the people here will begin to 
be more involved and more 
informed, 

Around 350 students stateWide 
are expected to participate this 
year, 150 more than the average 
attendance of the previous 
conferences, In the past 
conferences, the majority of the 
participants have been Chmese 

and Japanese students, This year 
however, the organizing 
commmee expects the majority 
to be Filipinos, 

Koria attributed this to the 
recent Philippine "People's 
Revolution ," He feels that the 
Filipino student community 
would like to discuss and share 
what IS happening in their 
country right now, Though there 
may be concentrations in the 
attendance of the conferences, 
Koria pOinted out that the 
purpose of APSU is to build a 
network among Asian-Pacific 
students and is urging Other 
Asian-Pacific student 
communities to join in , The 
conference, though dubbed as 
stateWlde, has also received past 
participation from the east coast 
as we)) as Hawaii.

copies 01 It 10 all the campuses 
Indicated on the applica!Jon. 
ThiS new policy has caused an 
In rease of over 10,000 freshman 
appltcanons to UCSD. According 
10 Reglstrar Ronald) Bowker, 
"last year [the number] went up 
from 5,800 freshman 
appltcallons 10 over 16,000 [for] 
thiS campus." 

The change In poltcy IS 
"intended 10 give the November 
application an equal shot at 
gettmg m at any and all 
campuses [of the UC systeml." 
Bowker said . Under the old 
system of applying, Bowker said 
that "3.8 and 3.9 GPA students 
were turned away from Berkeley 
and LA. .. By the time the 
apphcant was [notl fled of 
reJecllon], all the orher campuses 
had filled up , with the possible 
exception of RiverSIde and Santa 
Cruz. So here's a kid wuh a 3.8. 
or a 39 and he can't get Into 
Berkeley and he has no other 
opti ons. Meanwhlle , we were 
admllllng 3.1·s and 3.2'5. He was 
putting all hiS eggs m one basket 
[because of al poltcy that [UCI 
had et up." 

While the new policy can 
work to the stutlent's advantage , 
II also created greater 
competHlon for entrance to the 
UniversIty. For the fall of 1986, 
thr planned quota or Itmn wa~ 
3.350 new regIStered students, 
and 3.656 actua lly registered 
1 hese students were selected 
from a IOtal of 18,500 
appitcations. Of the 18,500 
appltcatlons recleved , 12,Soo 
were admitted and 3,350 of 
those we re expected 10 actually 
register. 

With th e new fil ing poltcy, the 
selection process has changed 
somewhat. Now, In order to 

weeke nd , one-week, and twO-
week tTl ps of TIJuana. 

These trips allow Ame ricans to 
enter desperately poor 
communities nO! as outsiders, 
but as fne nds. and 10 view the 
hfestyle of the poor through thetr 
own eyes. Poveny is a serious 
and endUring problem, Rev. Gray 
stressed, which needs 10 be 
understood nO( In terms of its 
effects on the Amencan middle 
class, but rather, on its effects on 
the Mexican and American poor. 

A typical one-day trip begins 
with an orientation Friday 
eve ning, in Sa n Diego, fo llowed 
by an early morning bord e r 
crossing the next day. Tours 
begin in a canyon area of 
Tijuana where most of th e 
pooresdamihes ltVI.' , and where 
Church groups d ispense food , 
clothing and medical sup ples. 

"W e are received surprisi ngly

In the fa ll of 1988, UCSD may 
receive close to 20,000 
applicatio ns. "And the quota 
d own the road doesn 't change 
that much ," Bowker said. "It was 
supposed to be 3,400 this year. 
T he most it could inc rease in the 
next five ye ars would be to 3,500 
total."

students who are elig ible Will be 
accomodated In the Unive rsity. 
And, In fa t . evety year 11 gets a 
llltle more selective." Because of 
the increases in th e nu mher at 

whic h is estimated to be close to 
2,000 total fewe r spaces a t San 
Diego, Irvine and Santa Barbara 
combined, is to compensate for 
over-enrollment in the fall of 
1986. Bowker says, "The re is still 
some dIscussio n labour dropping 
enrollmentl. Th e [UCj 
President's Office is putting some 
pressure on us to increase 
enrollment . But Santa Barbara 
and Irvine are c urting back even

UC D over-enro lled by 300 last

not prom ised sp iffy labs and a 
private offi ce. Because of a 
shortage of space, Chodo row 
said , "We hire more temporary 
faculty then we would like. They 
do n't get into research and 
labora tori es. We don't give them 
laboratOries. They can share 
o ffices. And 0 what you find is 
th at every thing - our growth -
is held up by lack of space." 

However, more space is under 
construction , and even more is 
in th e plans. "W e're building an 
engineering building." Chodorow 
said. 'That will raise our quotient 
because we're below SO percent 
of the space we need in 
engineering. We should have 
half the students we have in 
engineering. We've proposed to 
double the size of [Central! 
Library. We're proposing now a 
pew science building for 
chemistry and biology that will 
be huge--191 ,OOO square feet ." 
Chodorow estimated that if 
building continues at a rate of 80 
to 90,000 square feet every' year 
or two, we should stan to catc h 
up and acquire the space we 
need by 1993 or 1994. 

In addition, UCSD will open a 
fifth college, which will be 
referred 10 by the same name, in 
the fall of 1988. Its emphasis will 
be on international education . 
Students will take comparative 
culture cO\lrses, languages, world 
civilization courses, area studies 
and the like. The opening of 
Fifth College will not raise the 
admission quota , Bowker said. 
Rather enrollment at the existing 
colleges, whic h are currenrly 
overcrowded , will be cur back. 

However, plans are being 
made to increase the size of the 
campus Significantly. "Right 
about now, we' re thinking about 
whether we should ever set up a 
Sixth college, say, in the middle 
of the 1990'5, or enlarge the 
existing colleges," Chodorow 
said . "There's a plan to enlarge 

th c cam pus. [It I should continue 
to grow at least III the yca r 2009 
Maybe J bit beyond ." 

The need for more space is 
critical. Each year approXimately 
12.5 percent of th e graduating 
high school seniors a re qualified 
to e nter the UC systcm Last 
yea r, 7.8 percen! of h igh sc hool 
se niors. 2.8 percent more th an 
expected, a tte nded a UC 
campus. "Technically, we have 
a n obligation to accept the whole 
12.S pe rcent." Chodorow sa id. 
"Technically, anyone who is 
qualified for the UC system 
should have a right to co me 
here. That's a princi ple of th e 
organtza tlon of the syste m." 

Alth ough no one expects the 
entire 12.S percent to come to 
UC, many qualified students who 
wish to attehd , and should be 
able to , cannot "The pressure on 
us to accept them is enormous: 
said Chodorow, "absolutely 
enormous. The pressure comes 
from the legislature and, 
ultimately, from parents whose 
c hild ren have achieved a 3.6 
CPA and they are not getting in ." 

With this kind of competition , 
high school years can no longer 
be thought of as the days of 
carefree youth. California high 
school students must compe te 
with each Olher for a limited 
number of spaces in the UC and 
state university system. The 
competition is funher intensified 
by the sharp rises in the cost of 
private universities and cut backs 
in federal and state financial 
aids. Gone are the days from 
which grew the Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High fantasy of high 
school. IGI

enduring p ractical ass istance. In 
the progmm's second stage, 
Ame rica n volunteers Will make 
longer trips to MeXICO to assist 
in community charity projects. 
Stage three, the most important 
of the program, attempts to deal 
with the root causes of hunger 
and poverty through long-range 
development programs reaching 
beyond the charity level. 

Given the enomlity of the 
world-wide hunger program, Rev. 
Gray admitted , it is easy to 
becom!' discouraged about the 
real benefits of individual aid . 
While "it's not our job" to 
assume the responsibility for 
remedying poveny, he 
co ntended , it is necessary to "be 
honest about what's there ," to 
accept hunger and poverty as 
existing social realities, which 
must be dealt with In humane , 
non:political, and non-
paternalistiC w~ys. 

Ultimately, the real effect .that 
such an educational program can 
have in MeXICO is minimal, Rev. 
Gray stated , but experiencing 
poverty first-hand is an 
important step in effecting a 
change in attitude which can 
improve the American response 
to poverty. "Initially in San 
Diego," he recalled , "I 
encountered apathy and a lack 
of awareness that (suc h) a 
problem existed . (Afte r spending 
a day in Tijuana ,) I saw dramatic 
attitudinal changes on our end . 

"We emphaSize servlce-
projects. We try to immerse 
peo ple in poveny, and to remove 
the stereotypes of laziness and 
stupidity" which have 
traditionally characterized 
American conceptions o f poveny.

for February 20-21. For more

FEATURES 

With increasing migrarion to the sunbelt region and accessible 
opportunities to privately owned an collections, New York City is 
no longer the sole "center of the arts." Even though the artistic 
wealth has been spread , New York City will always be remembered 
for what she has hosted : specific anistic movements schools and 
lifestyles. ' 

II'l an exhibition titled 'Joe Brainard: Selections from the Butts 
Collection at UCSD" the work of Brainard, a "New York School" 
pOCt and anist will be on display at the Mandeville Gallery from Feb. 
19-March 22. 

The Bu~ts Collec tion contains nealy 300 examples of Brainard's 
art wO.rk , inc~uding drawings, paintings and collages as well as 
cover Illustrations, manuscripts and published works. 

The exhibi tion consists of a large gift of Brainard's work given to 
the UCSD hbraty by the Robert T. and Helen M. Butts Family Trust 
in 1984 and 1986. 

The "New Y~rk School" movement, characterized by abstract. 
artIstic experSSlOn , began in the 1940s and SOs and influenced 
circles of painters. sculptOrs and writers of various genres. The 
movement brought attention to a break from classicism which 
ultimately gave rise to American Modernism. 

In 1961 , Brainard worked closely with other prolific New York 
school wnrers and painters including Frank O'Hara,john Ashberry , 
Ron Padgett, Ted Berrigan and Dick Gallup. 

Brainard IS the author of several books, among them "I 
Remember," "More I Remember," "Nothing to Write Home About," 
and "Bolinas Journal." The "I Remember" books contain one-
sentence framents of such 19S0~ momentos as, "I remember when 
polio was the worst thing in the world ." His erotic serial take off, in 
t.he late 1960s, of Ernie Bushmiller's canoon strip, "Nancy," is a 
tamous, scandalous work of that era. Brainard's recent work tends 
to focus on painting, collage and assemblage . 

On Thursday. Feb. 19, a public reception from 5-7 pm will kick 
off a poetry reading by Brainard at 7:30 pm in the gallery. 
AccompanYing Brainard will bean critic and poet Bill Berkson who 
will also read. 

On Feb. 20 , New York poets Kenward Elmslie and Anne 
Waldma.n will give text. performances of their work at 8 pm in the 
MandeVille Center ReCItal Hall . There is no admission charge for 
these events, or for entry into the Mandeville Gallery. The gallery is 
open from noon to S pm , Tuesday through Sunday.

UCSD dominates LaVerne 
Spikers run over Leopards in 3-1 decision 
By MARK PRESSMAN 

A simply superior team, the Tritons of UCSD, spiked the University of La 
Verne Tuesday night. Although 
UCSD was denied a clean sweep, 
losing the third game 13-15, they

Tritons fIZzle in last game of the season 
By CHARLES TABESH, Contnbuting Sports Editor 

T HE UCSD "Top Guns" finished thei r Triton careers Tuesday night, not with a bang, but with a whimper. The three seniors, Brian Backens, Greg 
Kamansky and John Saintignon, along with the team's 
supporting cast, lost to USIU, 106-94, at Golden Hall. 

Inspired by the film , the theme of the men's basketball 
team this season has been "Top Gun." The oUlside 
bombing of Backens, Kamansky and Saintignon has led 
UCSD to an 18-8 record , it's second best finish ever. 

But even though they had beaten Division I USIU by 
11 earlier this year, the Tritons weren't able to end the 
season with a victory. The Gulls forged ahead to an early 
lead and had a 56-44 advantage by halftime. "We ope ned 
up kind of sluggish ." Coach Tom Marshall explained. 

He was still confident atthe intermission , however, 
because the Tri tons had started to show signs of 
Improvement. USIU, In the other hand , apparently wasn 't 
impressed as they stretched their lead to rwenty points 
near the start of the second half. 

Then Kevin Stewart started to take over for UCSO. His 
inside play coming off the bench brought the Tritons to 
within six with four minutes to play. Time started to run 
OUt, though, and UCSO was forced to try some 
desperation three pointers. They couldn't conven, and the 
Gulls won running away. 

"You never want to end on a loss," Marshall said, but 
he's still very pleased with the team's season. His biggest 
disappointment is the failure of the Tritons to make the 
playoffs. 

Thiny rwo teams are selected for the DIVISIOn III 

Al McGllire 
In hot pursuit of 
parity in the NCAA 

If you take your Webster's 
down off the shelf, you'll find 
that parity IS defined as "the 
state or condltlon of being the 
same in power, value , rank, etc. 
Equality." 

Equality. That's what panry 
should mean in college basketball 
tOday. Unfonunately, It doesn 't 

When they talk about parity In 
college hoops, it's a 
misdemeanor. It's hke General 
Patton talking about "Blood and 
Guts" - his gutS and your ' 
blood. Right now, parity means 
the top 20 DiVision I teams in 
the country. And then there's the 
other 263. 

I think It's time that we do 
something to truly bnng about 
panty In thiS sport, to bnng the 
elite back to the pack a little bit, 
to StOp it from being governed 
co mpletely by the traditional 
areas, from Boston to Ralelgh-
Durham and In a 250-mlle 
radiUS of SprIngfield , illInOIS 
Tho!>C are the twO areas that 
alwa ys seem to have 80% of the 
powerhouses and 90% of the 
publiCity, whether it be Boob 
Tube, radiO or newspapers. So I 
think I[ would be good for 
college basketball, if we tried to 
help make It a truly nationWide 
sport again , dn Atlantic-to-Paclfic 

ng scorer this 

championship tournament, and UCSD would seem to 
qualify. "We're definitely one of the top 32 teams in the 
country," claims Marshall. The problem is that only four 
teams from each region are invited, and the Tritons are 
in a very strong region this year. "There are four or five 
teams that are better than us," he saki. 

So now it's time to look to next season - a season 
without the ''Top Guns." On the surface, it looks like the 
Tritons could be in trouble without Backens, Kamansky, 
and Saintignon. After all, UCSD averaged about 85 fOints 
a game, and those three accounted for almost 58 '0 them. 

Backens was chosen as the team's MVP and finished 
with an average of 19.2 points a game. Kamansky led the 
team in scoring with a 19.8 average and Saintignon was 
third with 17.5. Also, all three were nominated to become 
all-Americans. 

But Marshall is convinced the .team will get even 
stronger in the years to come. "We're a very young team," 
he said . The "Top Guns" are the only seniors on the 
team, so everybody else will be back. 

And Marshall's search for new talent has been 
successful. "We're funher along in our recruiting process 
than ever before," he said. UCSD's academics and climate 
are certainly attrat:tive to new recruits, but the newly 
developed tradition of winning is what has helped the 
most. "At every position on the floor, we have quality." 

AU of this has led Marshall to an optimistic outlook, to 
say the least. "We should dominate Division 1II within the 
next three or four years," he said. &::::J

How? 
Well, I can think of three 

things that would help make th e 
game more representative in all 
areas, and not just a token 
invitation to 32 of the 64 teams 
in the NCAA tourney each year, 
where even the most amateur 
gambler can normally pick 30 of 
the 32 wi nners in the first 
round. AU we have to do is enact 
these three things, and college 
basketball will become a realisti 

. - and more popular - game, 
without people knowing who's 
going to win in most cases 
before the lights even go on in 

. the locker rooms.

Will Los Lobos survive 
tThe Light of the Moon?' 

The follow-up to a critjcally 
and somewhat commercially 

successful album is much like 
the sequel to a successful 
motion picture - in virtually 
all cases it can never be as 
good as the original. Many 
bands have fallen prey to this 
dilemma: The Go-Go's never 
quite recaptured the playful 
flair of "Beauty and the Beat," 
The Knack was knocked out 
from their rags to riches to 
rags fable after their follow~ 
up, and Peter "Frampton 
Comes Alive" pretty much 
died after the ballyhooed "J'm 
in You." 

This curse has, unfortun~ 
ately, bit Los Looos. The task 
of matching the brilliance of 
"How will the Wolf survive?" 
was an impossibility - the 
varied assortment ofTex-Mex 
c ajun blues, rockabilly, 
nonei'fo, the accordian-
infected polkas and ballads of 
Northern Mexico and Texas-
mixed with some hard-driving 

rock ~n-roll had critics 
howling praises for the band 

born in east L.A. The laudits 
included winning the ~.A. 
Times "Album of the Year" in 

198~, and critics and fans 
salivated in anticipation for an 
equally impressive follow~up. 

But the ethnic pizzaz that 
paced the first album, is 
missing in "By the Light of the 
Moon." Instead of serving up 
a classic dish with the spice 
and zest of "How Will the 
Wolf Survive," Los Loboslong 
awaited follow~up album 
seems like a homogenized 
blend, catering to the Taco 
Bell crowd. 

"By the Light of the Moon" 
is a much tamer album than 
"Wolf." Gone is the zippiness 
of Serenata Nortel\a, the 
rabble rousing of "Don't 
Worry Baby," and the stirring 
motion of "How the Wolf 
Will Survive." What one gets 
is the tinniness of "One Time, 
One Night" and "Is This All 
There Is," and the poppy 
"Set Me Free (Rosa~Lee)," 
which includes riffs that come 
dangerously close to the one's 

by IUltavo santoyo 
by wham in their song 
"Freedom." 

Although the album may be 
disappointing in its inevitable 
comparison to "Wolf," an 
average album by Los Lobos is 
still better than most by other 
bands. The most memorable 
song on the album may be the 
only one sung completely in 
Spanish - the accordian 
ballad "Prenda del Alma" - a 
reflective poem on lovers, 
who for some reason cannot 
be together . "To see this cruel 
destiny condemn us/ My love 
I'm afraid that you'll forget 
me l My heart keeps telling me 
1 can't take itl lean 't take this 
anguish anymore." 

But there are some dazzling 
cuts on the album. "One 
Time, One Night" essays the 
trials of a family in search of 
the American dream, 
highlighted by David 
Hidalgo's soulful croon . "The 
Hardest Time" is a devasting 
narrative about a woman's 
battle with loneliness in a new 
country. Songwriters Hidalgo 
and drummer Louie Perez 

bottle the melancholia simply, 
but effectively. 

MTV has given the 
"Lobitos" a commercial 
boost by making their 
Hitchcock laced video 
"Shakin' Shakin' Shakes," 
"Hip Clip of the week." The 
song, though, is just a 
roclcabilly diddy that could 
have been done by the Sera, 
Cats. 

Los Lobos is no stranger to 
the UCSD campus - at the 
1984 Sun GOd festival - Los 
Lobos seared a jammed~ 
packed Triton Pavillion with a 
set that not only included 
songs from their first LP . " 
... and a time to dance" and 
"Wolf," but also crowd 
pleasers like "La Samba" and 
"Volver, Volver" had the 
main gym shaking. 

Los Lobos has always been a 
favorite with the college 
crowd, but according to 
KSDT music director Mark 
Neiter, the new album is not 
getting the kind of response 
and airplay on campus that 

their previous album did. 
Neiter stated a few reasons 

for the lukewarm reception of 
the new album, "They should 
have done more ethnic things 
on the album, but this one's a 
lot more commercial it's kind 
of a sellout." 

The chartS show that the 
album is also not doing well at 
other campuses. Rockpoll, a 
college radio journal, has "By 
the Light of the Moon" at 
number nine, a mediocre 
showing considering the 
bands previous accomplish-
ments and popularity at the 
college level. A more 
mainstream chart - The Hard 
Report - which is based on 
airplay from album oriented 
rock stations has the group in 
the number eight slot. 

"By the Light of the Moon" 
is a good but not great album. 
"How Will the Wolf 
Survive" only helped to 
magnify its flaws, but by its 
own merits, Los Lobos give the 
album enough character to 
make it enjoyable.

A Case of talent 
by mark pinkus 

hiatus 's top five placed 
Peter Case's self-titled debut 
album at number three for 
1986. The New York Times 
went as far as to name Case's 
blend of folk rock as the best 
album of the year . But still the 
most often comment when 
Case's name is brought up is, 
"Who is this guy?" 

For starters, Peter Case will 
be performing at the Belly Up 
Tavern in Solana Beach this 
Wednesday, February 25 at 9 
pm. It would be wise to buy 
ti!=kets early because his 
previous club dates have sold 
out. 

To compensate for the fans 
that arrive at the club only to 
find out that there are no 

tickets left, Case has been 
known to take his guitar, walk 
outside, and just play on the 
streets. "There just were a lot 
of people out on the street and 
it seemed like a fun thing to 
do. Aside from L.A., I also did 
it in Madison and Denver," 
explains Case. 

Case's style of music places 
a lot of emphasis on the lyrics 
which are often very personal. 
"Some songs are autobiogra-
phical," stated Case, "while 
some are biographical and 
some are just songs." 

"Steel Strings," the second 
song on the album, is an 
autobiographical song which 
explains not only his distaste

With song titles like "Small 
Town Spree" and "Walk in

expect another Springsteen or

explains m the album liner 
notes, "I didn't know any 
songs about America - these 
songs are about sin and 
salvation. Have fun."

real picture. These songs are 
about people's souls, dealing 
with their dreams, with life, 
and dlsappomtment."

for some musicians but a way 
of explaining himself. "Do 
you want a man of steel or do 
you want a man that's real? 
Some of them hide when the 
doorbell rings. They're only 
made of steel when they're on 
steel strings," sings Case. 

Again in the interview, he 
denied any connection of

patriotism movement 
sweepmg the airwaves. "They 
(the songs) are not about 
America in the way those 
Pepsi commercials make 
everything look . The real 
truth to the matter is 
America's more mysterious 

Although this is Case's first 
solo album, he is not a rookie 
to the music scene. The early 
part of the eighties found Case 
heading one of Los Angeles's 
finest cl ub bands, The 
Plimsouls. Being a lead singer 
of a rock band only to leave It 
all behind for a drastic, much 
less commercial, musical 
change is a bit out of the 
ordinary, but it is what Case 
wanted. 

After being received 
warmly by crowds as an 
opening act on Jackson 
Browne's summer tour, Case 
embarked on a solo tour, in 
whICh he has been olaymg 
clubs throughout the country 
with a special performance at 
the Ann Harbor Folk Festival. 
"Right now' I'm playing alone 
and I really like It," explains 
Case. "It's a whole different 
kmd of show. It gives you the 
opportunity to be very free 
and go wherever you want to 

Although Case has been 
lauded by the press, any real 
commercia I success has 
eluded him, but this hasn't 
bothered him. In response to 
the lack of commercial 
success, Case states, "I'd 
rather have what I'm doing 
move people. If that involves 
playing for a limited audience 
and giving something to just 
them, then that's what I want. 
When I'm playing music, I try 
to inspire and move both 
myself and other people. It's a 
question of spirit." 

"I just felt it (playing with 
The Plimsouls) was bankrupt.

UCSO professor Chip 
Lord, of the Visual Arts 

-department, will examine a 
potpourri of prominent Video 
artists tonight at 'the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemproary 
Art. 

The lecture's deceptively 
dry title, Video Discourse: 

Mediated Narratives, belies 
what promises to be an 
enjoyably informative - as 
opposed to the more common 
informatively dull - slide 
lecture and video presen-
tation. 

Lord's meshing of an 
academically precise under-

standing of narrative video 
with an extensive personal 
background in making videos 
is the cause for optimism: he is 
in position to be both 
articulate and insightful while 
hiS interest in the subject may 
even, hopefully, make for a 
lively lecture. Lord will be 
presenting several videos and 
slides to accompany his 
lecture, a reassuring notion to 
anyone weaned on visual

UCSD's academic oriented life-style seems to leave little free-time for 
the full-time student. An evident problem for students is finding excuses 
not to study and avoid feeling guilty at the some time. Every student 
undoubtably needs relief from the unrelenting grind of chern-lobs, 
physics problem sets, and term papers due every other day of the week; 
the problem is in what form this rei ief should toke. The more popular extra-
curricular octivites fortunately, seem to include the student body os a 
whole. The TG's for example. have always been successful. Students from 
fiNery corner of UCSD, as well as off campus (including the usual 
scattered won no-bees from locol high schools) gather at the hump 
fiNery Friday afternoon, Ilsten to music, socialize, drink and be merry for 
absolutely .no charge. The merriment continues as students complete 
the giant migration from the hump to the Triton Pub as Friday night rages 
on, and on, and on. Other J:X)pular activites include weekly mo.ties for a 
buck. sponsored by the AS. Social Committee, and the extensive 
Intramural program, where students con participate in a wide array of 
sports at anyone of three degrees of competitiveness. What these events 
have in common is that any student can take advontoge of these 
programs anytime he or she wishes. One such event that has been 
overlooked by much of the student body is fan appreciation for the 
teams, athletes and overall spirit for UCSD. -

, 

It was John Riley (President of AS.) 'W'ho originally recognized the lock 
of concern the four colleges had in jointly producing school spirit. His solution was the creation of the first AS. Sports Activity Boord. 
who's sole concern is the generation of student awareness. support and enthusiasm of UCSD intercollegiate athletics. 

The AS. Sports Activity Boord, which has adopted the nome, "Triton Waves," consists of representatives from all four colleges. 
including Gino Frasca( 3rd). Lynn Bailey (Revelle), Mike Keegan (Warren) and Mike Okimoto (Muir). Other members Include David 
Friend (AS. Appt.) and Ex Officio Ira Rubenstein (V.P. Finance). The whole ball of wax is chaired by ReveileJunior Anita Del Bello. The 
nome Triton Waves, originates from Greek Mythology. Triton. son of Polseldon and Amphitrite. was a mole Sea God, who blew his 
conch shell to stir up the seas and rivers which he controlled. The Sports Activity Boord, with its own conch shell, hopes to create its 
ONn waves, in the form of school spirit. Unlike Triton however, who often befriended passing sailors. the Sports Committee hopes its 
Triton Waves will g ive our athletes the advantage to sink opposing teams in NCAA competition. 

AS. Triton Waves opened up winter quarter with its first special event Student Organization Night. Various student organizations 
shattered the sound barrier vying for most spirted prices, as they watched the men's basketball team defeat Claremont-Mudd. Next 
on the agenda was the Baseball Home Opener and Barbecue. Triton Waves supplied the Luau Dogs. sodas. and the works as the 
men's baseball team took on Hawaii Pacific for a double-header. These first two events received popular response. giving Tritons 
Waves a bright outlook for the future. 

The future is already here with a number of events planned for upcoming weeks. Friday the 13th, Triton Waves will be sponsoring 
Fan Appreciation Night: be one of the first 200 fans In attendence at the Triton Pavilion for men's basketball, on the 14th, Carnations

men's volleyball game. After the IG" be one of the first 200 fans to receive specially designed megaphones to help t he Tritons blast

on Friday. March 13th and watch the men's volleyball team spike Chapman in the Triton Pavilion. 

Triton Waves are also taking the action to classes starting today. and continuing every Tuesday and Thursday of winter quarter. 
Sports Committee Reps will be giving QY.Iay free pairs of Padre tickets to the first two students spotted with Triton Waves Buttons or any 
Triton paraphernalia. Free butons can be p icked up in the AS. office, compliments of Triton Waves. 

With winter quarter almost over, AS. Triton Waves are already making plans for on even more exciting spring. With so many special 
events planned for the future. Triton Waves are looking for willing students to help out. A few oft he positions available include media 
relations, secretary, photographer, community, orientation and distributor represen atlves. Don't miss out on all the fun. come and 
pick up on applicaton at the AS. office today. 

The Triton Waves hope that the popularity of UCSD Intercollegiate Athletics will continue to rise. The combined spirit of all four 
Jlleges at UCSD can only give our athletics the competitive edge in NCAA competition. AS. Triton W<:Nes Is positive that student 

awareness of UCSD athletics has not only begun, but will remain established for years to come.

A 
modern 
message 

by eva wong 
William Shakespea re's 

Hamlet, occurring in an 
unspecified time, set in an 
unidentified place, opens 
February 25 and runs through 
Match 1 at the Warren 
Theatre on the campus of 
UCSD. 

From the moment the 
curtain opens, it is apparent 
that this version of Hamlet is 
presented from a different 
perspective. There are no 
castle walls, no ornate 
thrones, no Elizabethan 
trappings. Instead, a multi-
level set of wood and steel is 
used. -

By removing such "distrac-
tions" as lush scenery and 
ornate costuming, the plaY"s 
English-born graduate 
student director Ralph Janes 
hopes to focus the audience's 
attention on the language, 
verse and structure of the

The lecture will take a 
historical perspective on 
experimental and narrative 
video. But Lord will mostly be 
showing videos, including 
some of his own work. This 
includes "Easy Living," a 
piece that examines suburban 
tranquility entirely through 
the use of miniature sets and 
toy care. With the simple 
addition of actual ambient 
sounds, Lord and cohort 
Mickey McGawen manage to 
c reate an entertainingly 
s urreal, yet realistic, 
environment. 

"This is the first time the La 
Jolla Museum has had a 
currated show, and has made a 
committment to showinlZ 
videos in a gallery contest," 
enthused the pleased curator 
Lord. And he's right; galleries 
definitely can't be accused of 
overexposing video art. 
Lord's presentation and the 
month-long exhibition that he 
is cur rating marks an overdue 
acceptance of videos by 
galleries. 

Lord's presentation is also a · 
good example of the double 
life that most UCSD 
professors lead. It is obvious 
that many professors aren't 
here for their nimbly vibrant 
and clear lectures -ve ry 
obvious to those students that 
need to bring translators to 
lecture-but mahy professors, 
including Lord, are able to 
teach with the same aptitude 
they lend to their personal 
work. Events such as tonight's 
exhibition emphasize the dual 
role. The La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art, located 
on 700 Prospect Street in La 
Jolla, is open Tuesday through 
Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm 
(and unti I 9 pm on 
Wednesday). Lord's lecture, 
toni~ht at 7:30 pm, is free to 
museum members, $1 for 
students/ seniors, and $2 for

play. He wants the rich, 
profound meaning of Hamlet 
- the implications of the 
play's action and ethos - to 
cross the centuries and 
"speak" to contemporary 
audiences. 

Janes explained, "Hamlet 
lived in volatile times. Society 
was changing. Paganism was 
giving way to Christianity, the 
oral tradition was giving way 
to the literal, and warlike 
behavior was being replaced 
by diplomacy. Change is the 
important element. The old 
world in our p~oduction is 

The time-honored play tells 
of "carnal, bloody and 
unnatural acts." It is the story 
of Prince Hamlet, his 
murdered father, his tainted 
mother, and his usurping' 
represented by wood and the 
new world by steel. 

"People will be familiar 
with some part of it - a line, a 
scene," Janes continued. 
"And the mental image most 
people have of the play is a guy 
in black tights and a black 
jaeket, saying, 'Alas, poor 
Yorick.' What we have to do 
is shatter that image and force 
people to re-examine this play 
in its totality. It's such a 
complex and human play. I 
think it has something to say 
to all of us'. " 

uncle. It is also a story of 
moral and ethical choices, 
chilling repercussions, and 
above all, revenge. 

Janes has directed a wide 
variety of plays in English 
regional and street theatres 
prior to enrolling in UCSD's 
graduate theatre program in 
the fall of 1985. He has been 
steeped in the world of 
Shakespeare since his eighth 
birthday, when he received 
the playwright's complete 
works from his parents. Over 
the years, he has collected 20 
different versions of Hamlet 
alone. He recently found a 
modern version of the play in 
street language for people who 
find verse, asJanessays. "hard 
to access."
