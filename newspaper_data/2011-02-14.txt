PANELISTS WEIGH IN ON EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION

By Chris McCoy
Staff Writer

Around 80 UCSD students and faculty 
attended a teach-in about Tunisia and Egypt’s 
recent uprisings held at Price Center West 
Ballroom on Feb. 10 — the day before former 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped 
down from his 29-year presidency.

The panel event discussed ongoing 
revolutions in the Arab world and was Hosted 
by the Arab Student Union, Students for Civil 
Rights in Iran, Students for Justice in Palestine 
and the Student Sustainability Collective.

Panelist Ahmed El Desouky, an Egyptian 
national who is finishing an engineering 
doctorate at San Diego State University, said he 
was in Egypt less than six months ago and did 
not expect anything of this magnitude to occur.

“I was honestly surprised by how people 
acted during the revolution,” he said. “There 
were two million people in Tahrir Square … 
[and] they’ve been managing to do all that 
[while] being very well-mannered.” 

Iranian-born UCSD literature professor 
and alumni Babak Rahimi, who specializes 
in Iranian and Islamic studies, compared 
the Egyptian movement to the 2009 Green 
Revolution in Iran.

“We’re talking about a global phenomenon 
here,” Rahimi said. 

Rahimi described the current movements 
as part of a worldwide demand for human 
rights and increased standards of living.

“What I felt in Iran was this aspect of 
daring, which we are seeing right now in the 
streets of Cairo, this aspect that ‘I am here to 
give my freedom and liberties, even if that 
would cost me my life,’” Rahimi said. 

He also warned attendees to be wary of 
Western news outlets’ misrepresentations of 
the situation.

“What is central to this movement is a 
demand for a particular kind of civil rights that 
is grassroots,” Rahimi said.

A.S. Council President Wafa Ben Hassine, 
a Tunisian-American who lived in Tunisia 
for four years as a child, said that prior to 
the revolution, citizens were afraid but the 
Tunisian revolution helped the momentum 
needed to end Egypt’s authoritarian regime 

“People there, my fellow Tunisians, would 
live in fear all the time,” Ben Hassine said. 
“You can’t have a meeting of three or four 
people. You can’t belong to any party that the 
government bans, whatever they believe in.”

The Tunisian revolution culminated in  the 
Tunisian President fleeing the country.

“There is a price to pay for everyone, 
and clearly Tunisians, a lot of them, 
believe in that,” Ben Hassine said.  
“They really believed in what they are doing, 

they had a passion that was stored in their 
souls for 23 years.”

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
Middle East studies professor Asef Bayat spoke 
via Skype about how Egyptians mobilized with 
social networking websites in recent weeks. 

“Things have changed, and now ... there is 
a new kind of politics [that combines] ideas 
of social justice and national dignity with the 
quest for democracy,” Bayat said. 

Bayat said the movement’s young activists 
were instrumental in leading protests in 
downtown Cairo. 

“This is a class with educational capital, 
with college degrees, who know about new 
social media, who have knowledge about the 
world,” Bayat said.

Bayat explained that massive protests were 
needed to create change in an autocracy.

“They must revert to street politics because 
they don’t have much of an institutional 
channel for which they can communicate their 
discontent,” Bayat said. 

Literature professor Fatima El-Tayeb said to 
consider the damaging ethnic notions on the 
Middle East, like how democracy and Islam 
cannot coexist and blanket statements about 
Muslims.

civilizations ... we must remember the

Two demonstrators demanded visiting speakers 
of the “Mexico Moving Forward” conference 
honor the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects 
of International Child Abductions. The treaty 
ensures prompt return of children abducted from 
their home country.

The Feb. 10 symposium — which included 
scientists, artists and philanthropists who 
discussed Mexico’s future in panels — was held 
at the Robinson Auditorium in the School of 
International Relations and Pacific Studies.

Trevor Richardson’s son, Andrew, was taken 
by his mother to Queretaro, Mexico in 2007. 
The couple divorced in 2006 and Richardson 
had court-ordered visitation rights, but he was 
no longer allowed to visit Andrew after his wife 
violated custody orders by taking him across the 
border. Since then, Richardson has been taking 
legal action to visit his son. 

“To this day, I’ve seen him for a total of five 
hours during court-granted visitations that take 
place in the gated playground of the courthouse 
in Queretaro under supervision of armed guards,” 
Richardson said.

San Diego residents Richardson and Marcy 
Beildeck held signs saying “Mexico moving 
backwards” and “Mexico return my son” to bring 
awareness to the lack of enforcement on the treaty. 

Richardson met with businessman and 
philanthropist Manuel Arango — who is 
considered one of Mexico’s wealthiest men.

“He took my information and recommended 
I speak with a civil rights [and] liberties group 
started in Mexico, who he knew, and said he was 
going to send me information,” Richardson said.

Richardson said most of the people who passed 
by between seminars did not want to engage.

“This wasn’t an aggressive protest,” Richardson 
said. “We stood out there, we held signs, we talked 
and we spread information. ”

Richardson said that, although Mexico signed 
the treaty, the government does not enforce it or 
apply custody orders from other countries.

“This is not about custody,” Richardson 
said. “It’s about the Hague treaty. In Mexico, the 
governments are not abiding by this treaty.”

Mexico is the worst violator of the treaty, 
according to a 2010 U.S. Department of State 
compliance report. 

“The Mexican elites are aware of their country’s 
deficiency in their country’s inability to follow this 
treaty,” Richardson said. “It’s also important to 
mention that our government is failing … by not 
holding Mexico accountable.”

Now, Richardson is waiting on a Mexican court

Prolonged exposure to 
environments with low oxygen levels, 
such as mountain ranges, can lead 
to permanent changes in your genes. 
Researchers discovered that flies 
under hypoxia (a shortage of oxygen) 
underwent permanent genomic 
changes.

In the study, UCSD researchers 
experimented on the fruit fly 
Drosophila melanogaster — a species 
with cellular mechanisms similar to 
humans’ — and tested the impact of 
hypoxia on their genes. They found 
that it causes permanent changes that 
were then passed down generations.

“The hypoxia-adapted flies passed 
the tolerance trait from generation 
to generation,” Division of Genome 
Information Sciences head Kelly 
Frazer said. “The trait persists even 
in the absence of hypoxic stress [such 
as] when they were exposed to normal 
oxygen levels. [This suggested] a 
genetic rather than physiological 

adaptation,” Frazer worked with 
School of Medicine professors 
Gabriel Haddad and Dan Zhou, who 
conducted the study. Haddad and 
Zhou began investigating the causes of 
flies’ ability to survive under constant 
hypoxia in 2005. The researchers split 
a population of fruit flies and bred 
them over 200 generations.

Frazer’s team bred the control 
population under normal oxygen 
levels, or about 21 percent. The other 
population was kept at a lethal oxygen 
level of 4 percent.

The gene expressions of the two sets 
of flies were compared to determine 
whether their ability to adapt was due 
to genetics or mere physiology. 

Using high through-put 
screening — a process which allowed 
researchers to identify any genome 
variations — the researchers were able 
to identify specific regions on the X 
and 3R chromosomes that contained 
mutations.

“If [these] mutations cause a fly 
to survive in low oxygen better, then 
flies who have this mutation would 

be more likely to have offspring than 
those who do not have the mutation,” 
biology graduate student Nitin Udpa, 
who analyzed the genome sequencing, 
said.  

“If you run the experiment 
over several generations, classical 
genetics suggests that this advantage 
would keep propagating until every 
individual in the population has the 
mutation,” Udpa said.

Analysis of the genes shows that 
the mutations were present in a cell 
signaling pathways, which are also 
present among many mammals, 
including humans. The findings 
strongly suggest that humans who 
can survive under decreased oxygen 
levels may also have similar genetic 
mutations.

“The next step is to perform 
similar types of genomic studies in 
humans.,” Frazer said. “The whole 
genome-sequencing costs have 
dropped significantly. We can start 
analyzing populations of individuals 
that live at high altitudes for evidence 
of adaptation to hypoxic conditions in 

the human genome.” 
Hypoxia doesn’t only affect those 

living at high altitudes. Strokes, heart 
attacks, neonatal diseases and cancer 
can also decrease oxygen flow to 
tissues.

“Since much of the [Notch] 
pathway is also present in humans, this 
could provide a lead in determining a 
mechanism for hypoxia responses in 
humans,” Udpa said.

Aside from the twice-quarterly LGBT dance and, of course, the annual day-long rager that is the Sun God Festival, there’s usually not much to do on campus. Unlike other UC schools 
— and nearly every other major university — there’s no Greek row for 
students to stumble to on a Friday night. 

So, in an attempt to solve this social quandary, A.S. Council’s 
Greek Housing Initiative Committee is looking to have a completely 
functional, up-and-running Greek row by 2016. And while it’s laud-
able that the committee wants to spice up the droll social life at UCSD 
with the best facilities possible, building a $60 million facility from the 
ground up isn’t the stuff of student government — especially when the 
UC system’s predicted to be facing a $1 billion budget gap next year.  

 A Greek row would, without a doubt, be a boon to campus life. 

UC Berkeley’s sororities and fraternities are the center of its social life 
and that can primarily be attributed to their Greek row that opens up 
Greek life to the rest of campus. Here, if you’re not a part of the Greek 
system, after being bombarded with flyers every Fall Quarter, you 
won’t likely notice much of them for the rest of the year — save those 
ubiquitous “Party With Pi Phi” tank tops, anyway.

But despite the benefits of a Greek row, with such fledgling plans in 
the pipeline, it’s impossible to wholeheartedly approve of the commit-
tee’s direction.

First, according to committee chair and Campuswide Senator 
Michael Raimondi, there’s no current estimate of the total cost. There’s 
also no estimate of how many houses, in total, a Greek row would 
require, since there may be new sororities in the works for next year.

Illegal immigration in Arizona has reached hair-raising proportions — 400,000 entered the 
state just last year. Though arguments on illegal 
immigration reform usually end up in a debate 
on equal rights, at least the proposal to deny 
birthright citizenship to children of non-citizens 
shows that state lawmakers are taking action to 
fix the problem.

Approximately 11.1 million illegal immi-
grants currently reside in the United States, with 
300,000 more crossing our borders each year. 
Most proposals to curb illegal immigration — 
like the infamous wall — in Arizona since 2007 
have gone nowhere, and immigration reform still 
remains on the back burner halfway into Obama’s 
presidency. 

The new bill, which reinterprets the 14th 
Amendment, demonstrates that lawmakers are 
getting creative with the immigration issue. It 
might be a drastic measure, but it’s also not final-
ized yet. There is a lot of room for argument and 
reinterpretation on the legislative floor.

The children of undocumented immigrants, 
pejoratively called “anchor babies,” complicate 
deportation issues, as many judges are unwilling 
to tear apart families. This measure will simplify 
the issue of judges having to go case-by-uncom-
fortable case, looking for a solution to each indi-
vidual immigration problem. 

Detractors may be quick to point fingers and 
deem the new proposal essentially “un-Ameri-
can,” but the bottom line is, any progress toward 
a resolution is more than welcome at this point. 
Although the bill may not be an end-all solution 
to illegal immigration, the proposition of new 
ideas still brings us one more option on how to 
end the issue.

ArizonaÊImmigrationÊCrackdown

Once again, Arizona has proven itself the state to avoid if you’re an illegal immigrant. The 
state’s legislature is looking to pass a bill that would 
eliminate birthright citizenship within its borders 
and prevent children of illegal immigrants from 
becoming citizens. The bill is misguided because it 
would leave some children without citizenship.

Under this proposed law, children of immigrants 
born on American soil would not qualify for jus 
soli citizenship, or citizenship by birthplace, in their 
various home countries. Instead, they have to hope 
for jus sanguinis citizenship, which is possible if one 
or both parents, depending on the country in ques-
tion, are already citizens.

Although the bill specifically targets illegal 
Mexican immigrants in Arizona, it would also apply 
to immigrants from any country. Unlike Mexico, 
where a child is automatically granted citizenship if 
a parent is a Mexican citizen, other countries have 
more stringent rules.

In countries like Argentina, both parents must 
be citizens for their child to gain citizenship. If only 
one parent is a citizen, their child is ineligible for 
Argentinean citizenship — and if the other parent 
is not an American citizen, under bill SB 1309, the 
child would also be ineligible for U.S. citizenship. 

In other cases, both parents may not have clear 
citizenship records, leaving their citizenship status 
ambiguous. There are many potential floodgates 
this bill can open. In situations where children lack 
any formal citizenship, the courts would have to 
determine the right form of action for each individ-
ual case, creating yet another burden to the system. 

In a country that celebrates its cultural melt-
ing pot, implementing such legislation would be 
a regressive step in the direction of the pre-Civil 
Rights era. 

— Revathy Sampath-Kumar

Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce introduced two illegal-immigration proposals on Feb. 7  
that, if passed, would repeal the 14th Amendment.

SB 1308 allows the governor to sign an agree-
ment with other states to make a distinction in birth 
records, creating a contract where a person can be 
a United States citizen only if she has at least one 
parent who is either a citizen or a legal permanent 
resident. More specifically, SB 1309 stipulates that 
a child born in Arizona will not attain citizenship 
unless one of the parents is a U.S. citizen. 

The proposals are a response to “anchor babies,”  
or the American-born children of illegal immigrants 
that allow their parents to stay in the country. 

It’s a sweeping measure that will open a can of 
worms. If this measure actually passes, it will allow 
other states — after necessary legal procedures — to 
join in Arizona’s new requirements for citizenship. 
These laws would be a direct challenge to the 14th 
Amendment, which stipulates that any person born 
in the United States is automatically a U.S. citizen. 

It makes sense that Arizona, a border state, 
wants to take action against illegal residents who use 
their children’s status to stay in the country. What 
makes no sense is that Pearce’s solution attacks a 
vital amendment. 

America has been anxious about immigration 
for a century. Before, the supposed threat was being 
funneled through Ellis Island and the Jews, Irish and 
Germans were the outsiders.

Today’s immigration problem requires reform, 
but redefining citizenship, the very basis of 
American rights, is not the answer. Whether the 
alternative is amnesty for those already living in the 
United States or a revised immigration process, the 
actions worth taking is doesn’t involve changing the 
Constitution.

I don’t care what the color of your bra is, where you put your purse or who your favorite cartoon character 
is. And for the love of God, please don’t 
invite me to your virtual Facebook sit-ins 
demanding world peace. Slacktivism has 
got to go.

“Awareness” is the favored term 
among slacktivists, though it offers 
no tangible goal. Taking five seconds 
to change a Facebook status that your 
700 closest friends may not see won’t 
stop genocide or prosecute Sudanese 
President Omar al-Bashir. Certainly, 
slacktivism garners awareness, but if 
everyone knows about a problem and no 
one does anything about it, we’re back at 
square one.

At best, some will join a listserv and 
receive e-mails they’ll never read. At 
worst, these actions breed complacency. 
The most quixotic will believe chang-
ing their profile picture to a cartoon 
character means they’ve done their duty 
in preventing child abuse. More realistic 
folks understand its limited effect but go 
along feeling better about themselves and 
believing it’s better than nothing.

Facebook and Twitter are tools to fur-
ther engage people, not genuine means 
of political activism. Having 100,000 
people across the world stand in virtual 
solidarity with the Egyptians, Yemenis, or 
Tunisians is worthless if they don’t active-
ly condemn these dictators. In Egypt 
itself, Tweets were mostly used to spread 
information on where protests were 
occurring. If the masses simply tweeted 
“Mubarak resign now #Jan25” instead of 
gathering in Tahrir Square, the people 
would be no closer to a democracy. 

Egyptians saw the tumult in Tunisia 
on television, and sought to bring justice 
to their own nation. Once the Internet 
was shut off in Egypt, the people still 
came out to protest and weren’t relying 
on online updates to encourage them. 
And despite the alleged power of Twitter 
in the 2009 Iran protests, the Tweeters 
were brutally put down by the govern-
ment. Had the army and police clamped 
down on the Egyptians as they did in 
Iran, Mubarak would still be in power. 
Online media is powerful, but it would 
be naïve to believe it alone could ignite 
revolutions. 

Admittedly, the new slacktivists aren’t 
likely to be people deeply invested in 
politics in the first place. If Facebook 
existed during MLK’s time, they might 
have changed their profile pictures to 
MLK, and then tuned into “The Beverly 
Hillbillies.” The Internet did not create 
political apathy, but the two fare well 
together.

Grassroots change isn’t impossible. 
The UCSD graduate Laren Poole who 
co-founded Invisible Children, an orga-
nization dedicated to preventing child 
abduction in Uganda, was able to further 
its goal by lobbying Congress. In 2009, 
as a result of Poole’s efforts, President 
Obama signed a bill to strategize the end 
of human rights violations and to fund 
peace. Though websites like Facebook 
were indeed helpful in promoting 
Poole’s cause — the activist today claims 
over 300,000 online fans — it was only 
through real-life action that progress was 
made.

Social networking devices can be 
used to mobilize populations, but they 
can’t be seen as the end solution when it 
comes to activism. Joining a Facebook 
group but not attending planning meet-
ings or protests has, in the end, the same 
effect as doing nothing at all.

1 in 4 adults experience mental health challenges such

Many don’t recognize the symptoms or think to seek

THE LITTLE RINTRAH By Eileen Shi

No Solid Plans, No Money, But at Least There’s Ambition

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I’ve noticed that there is a pretty 

expansive group of Muslims these 
days at UCSD. You might know one 
or two from your classes or have 
just seen them around. The girl 
with the headscarf who always is 
doodling during organic chemis-
try, or the guy on your intermural 
soccer team, who has a pretty long 
beard, even though he’s in his early 
20s. Or perhaps you have never 
actually talked to or known any-
body who is Muslim. 

Maybe the only words that 
come to your mind when the word 
“Islam” is mentioned are terror-
ism, fundamentalism or radicalism. 
I guess my real question to my 
classmates here on campus is: How 
much do you know about Islam?

This week the Muslim Student 
Association at UCSD is putting on 
“Islam Awareness Week: Straight 
from the Source.” And as somebody 
who has been a witness to the prep-
aration for it, I’m excited. Excited 
because all of us — Muslims, Jews, 
Christians, atheists and everything 
in between — are learning more 
about the faith I’ve found peace and 
hope in, my entire life. 

The MSA isn’t out to convert the 
masses; we’re not out there to con-
vert anybody. We are there to sim-

ply answer any questions that our 
community wants to know about 
Islam. Questions like “Why do you 
wear that scarf on your head?” or 
“What exactly IS jihad?”

Hijab Day, discussions about 
commonly misunderstood 
Quran verses, a “New Mosque 
on the Block,” talk regarding 
Islamophobia, free halal (the 
Muslim version of kosher) bar-
beque on Library Walk, spoken 
word performances, and a joint 
event-paying tribute to the Japanese 
internment during World War II 
with the Nikkei Student Union 
focusing on our common struggles, 
as well as an Islam exhibit on 
Library Walk with many real, live, 
friendly Muslims to talk to, makes 
for an event that is bound to raise 
up many interesting questions, as 
well as answers.

Without even knowing this basic 
fact, the budget will have to take into 
account the possibility of construct-
ing an extra two houses for potential 
new sororities — an addition that 
will have a big effect on the cost 
shouldn’t be taken lightly. (One thing 
Raimondi does know: He wants 
Mediterranean architecture.)

Raimondi is hoping the project’s 
total cost will be under $60 million. 
If so, Chancellor Fox will have the 
jurisdiction to sign off on the proj-
ect; if it’s not, the fate of a Greek row 
will be left to the mercy of the UC 
Board of Regents.

Another issue that seems unreal-
istic is Raimondi’s five-year timeline 
for completion. Few construction 
projects of this magnitude, from 
inception to completion, are realized 
in so little time; Raimondi himself 
admitted that the Muir and Revelle 
College apartments have been in the 
works for decades — and that’s with 
a much larger planning commit-
tee and much more concrete plans 
behind them.

In the mold of other UC campus-
es before it — and after it — UCSD 
would, ideally, have constructed a 
Greek row before its 50th anniver-
sary this year. Because it hasn’t, it’s 

up to campus leaders like Raimondi 
to get the ball rolling. 

It’s important to recognize 
Raimondi’s drive in tackling such an 
ambitious project; most campuswide 
senators  have smaller ambitions, 
like spearheading local environmen-
tal or diversity initiatives, to cement 
their legacy on council. But until his 
committee can provide some sem-
blance of a response to the myriad 
unanswered questions, it’s difficult to 
call the committee’s optimistic plans 
anything but naïve.

M uir College senior Jorge Narvaez has been cramming for midterms, clean-ing his apartment and making sure his 
daughters eat their vegetables. He also has to 
start preparing his set for next months South 
by Southwest music festival.

Narvaezs self-made YouTube video is one 
of the most popular viral hits of the year, and 
has granted him the fame he needs to land 
the gig at the music festival and jumpstart his 
career.

It took about 10 takes, but Narvaez and 
his six-year-old daughter Alexa finally got it 
right: an adorable father-daughter rendition of 
Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic 
Zeros, filmed on New Years Eve. After about 
a week, the video got a million hits. A month 
later, it has over six million.

These days, Narvaez, the father of Alexa 
and two-year-old Eliana, might get recognized 
around campus for his Internet fame, but 
music has always been a big part of his family 

life. 
Ive incorporated music in her life since 

she was born, Narvaez said of Alexa. I used to 
sing to her moms stomach. From the moment 
she was born, she could recognize my voice.

Even the fateful night that ignited their 
fame was just like any other for the family of 
three. 

We didnt stage anything, Narvaez said. 
We were just having fun. We played it a lot, 
just because we liked it. 

In addition to being a doting father, 
Narvaez is the historian for UCSD MEChA, 
a Chicano student movement organization, as 
well as a professional photographer, and has 
represented UCSD in the advertising cam-
paign for the campuss 50th anniversary.

Narvaez is also one of the founding mem-
bers of a nonprofit organization called Reality 
Changers, which also happens to be the name 
of his YouTube channel. The nonprofit pro-
vides tutoring services, SAT preparation and

UCSDS CALIT2 TAKES 3-D TO 
NEW HEIGHTS  WATERFALLS, 

ROBOTS AND ALL.
BY SARAH ROBINSON

STAFF WRITER

H ang on to those cheap 3-D glasses  if all goes as planned at UCSDs Calit2, they might be your ticket to a new kind of virtual reality. Calit2, or the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology,  is 
a UCSD-UC Irvine partnership that brings together researchers from 
multiple disciplines to create innovative new applications  in this 
case, amping up 3-D technologies for the home and the cinema.

3-D will definitely [be more prevalent in] video games  players 
will be able to see depth and feel more immersed in the game, Calit2s 
Director of Visualization Tom DeFanti said. Eventually, games will be 
in full [virtual reality], where you can walk through walls and change 
your perspective. Movies dont allow you to look at anything you want: 
Youre stuck with what the camera sees. 

Due to high demand for improved 3-D technology, Calit2 has 
partnered with CineGrid, a technological alliance made of dozens 
of companies from across the globe (including Disney), in order to 
improve the speed of 3-D technology and make the presentation more 
attractive to viewers. 

At CineGrids fifth annual conference, held Jan. 18 at UCSD, 
members from all over the globe displayed their technological break-
throughs and discussed the future of 3-D imaging, including ideas like 
broadcasting the 2014 World Cup in 3-D. So far, the loudest propo-
nent of 3-D advancement is the entertainment industry (and under-
standably so  according to Boxofficemojo.com, Avatar grossed 
$2.7 billion worldwide). The surge of interest has brought a slice of 
Hollywood to the Calit2 offices: Director Joseph Kosiniki (TRON: 
Legacy) visited the institute a few weeks ago to discuss 3-D technol-
ogy, and Disney has continued to work closely with the department 
on future projects. 

According to DeFanti, who was also one of the digital animators 
responsible for the Star Wars saga, TRON: Legacy relies on passive 
3-D technology, whereas 3-D televisions use active 3-D technology. 
Essentially, passive 3-D relies on film in the users glasses, while active 
makes use of an automated machine in a bulkier, more expensive pair. 

DeFantis pioneering work at Calit2 is done completely in passive 
3-D, the norm for movie theaters. In passive 3-D, two images are 
projected on the screen. The glasses filter the images so that each eye 
sees something different, though your brain sees them as a one multi-
dimensional image. The process of filtering, called polarization, allows

you to see in stereo. Passive 3-D is easier on the eyes and wal-
let, and creates a sharper image than its active counterpart.

The nouveau-popular 3-D TVs use active technology, 
due to copyright issues on passive projectors. The main 
differences: Active shades don’t filter the images, and have 
built-in blinders that cover your eyes 60 times a second, 
manually separating the images. It’s still visible in stereo, but 
the glasses batteries require constant charging. (They also 
have another downside: nausea.) 

Active 3-D is newer, and relatively cheap to mass pro-
duce. Manufacturers of 3-D TVs pass off the price to the 
consumer; the required glasses are more expensive due to 
the mechanics of the blinders. Passive glasses only cost $1.20. 
Active glasses run for about $130.

Eventually, there will be an alternative to expensive 3-D 
TVs with the advent of passive 3-D variants. With the help of 
breakthroughs at Calit2, moviegoers can one day expect to 
view films from perspectives other than the camera’s. 

Calit2’s NexCave and StarCave projects have created a 
breakthrough in the technology by offering moving perspec-
tives in 3-D stereographics (the on-screen images that create 
the illusion of 3-D). Both one-room virtual simulators use 
passive 3-D and produce images so startlingly realistic they 
will, according to DeFanti, “blow your pants off.”

The NexCave is a smaller simulator that allows users to 
explore anything from a cave in Vietnam to a floor plan of 
Atkinson Hall. It is constructed of multiple high-resolutions 
screens arranged in a concave shell. You can virtually view 
anything you want — even other galaxies. 

“Archaeological sites are often in countries experiencing 
political turmoil,” DeFanti said. “The NexCave allows them 
to study 3-D images of artifacts without being in harm’s way.”

Calit2’s real prize, however, is the StarCave. It focuses 
more on visual effects used in cinema and video games. 
According to DeFanti, the StarCave immerses viewers in a 
movable virtual reality. He said it could even revolutionize 
the video game and movie industries.

“People freak out when we make the floor beneath them 
disappear,” DeFanti said. “It’s definitely something you have 
to see.” 

He’s got a point. Those who enter the cave are surround-
ed by as many as 20 high-resolution screens, each spanning 
10 to 12 feet high. Viewers must wear a visor with four silver 

balls resting on the brim, which tell the computer and pro-
jectors exactly where you are. Remote control in hand, the 
journey begins. 

The five-stage virtual reality sequence begins with a digi-
tized waterfall of colors. In a few minutes, four more water-
falls spurt from the screens. StarCave can zoom in and out 
as the “water” collects at viewers’ feet. The cascading water 
ushers in the floating spirals that can be sliced through with 
a wave of the hand.

As the spirals disappear, the room is suddenly filled with 
beams of light moving so slowly that it’s possible to see the 
photons glide by. The remote allows viewers to draw any 
shape on the walls and watch it glide past — even through 
their own bodies. 

The piece de resistance might just be majestic enough to 
yield tears from James Cameron himself. StarCave projects a 
dock overlooking a beautiful lake. Beams of color spin over-
head like firecrackers at Chinese New Year. The waves gently 
roll along, and with a click of the remote, the sun will rise, 
turning the water into a pool of gold. Only thing missing? 
The smell of the sea. It’s enough to make anyone speechless.

The illusion, of course, isn’t as effortless as it appears. 
Because 3-D projects separate images to each eye, the third 
dimension requires twice the pixels, projectors and band-
width of traditional film. According to Laurin Herr, co-exec-
utive director of CineGrid, it’s hard to create a virtual world 
on the big screen that aligns with human depth perception. 
During the post-production phase of 3-D movies, film edi-
tors have to make sure the stereographics will properly align, 
or else the multi-dimensional illusion fails.

“When you are revealing a 3-D visual effect, the chal-
lenge is that the images projected to the left and right eyes 
must be in sync, otherwise you won’t see in stereo,” he  said. 

But the future of 3-D technology looks bright — and not 
just for Hollywood. According to DeFanti, the technology is 
also being used to help amputees learn how to use artificial 
limbs. He hopes to one day be able to move within a virtual 
world, turning simulated doorknobs and opening artificial 
doors. 

For now, looks like he’s stuck in an unbelievable pan-
orama. Could be worse.

college students like himself, and 
has recently gained the attention of 
U.S. Secretary of Education Arne 
Duncan, who sees the organization 
as a potential model for the govern-
ment in creating a similar program.  
On top of all this, Narvaez, an ethnic 
studies major with an emphasis on 
literature and international migra-
tion studies, also boasts a 3.6 GPA.

“If it goes the way I think it’s 
going to go … I’m going to con-
tinue my musical career, no doubt 
about it,” Narvaez said. “But I’m 
also applying for the MFA program 
at UCSD, and that’s my priority. If 
my family needs me to be a student, 
I’ll be a student.”

As a working, sin-
gle dad and student, 
Narvaez has had his 
fair share of challeng-
es in his path to suc-
cess, none of which he 
let hold him back.

“Jorge is unstop-
pable,” friend and 
Reality Changers col-
league Grace Chaidez 
said. “He’s the kind of 
man that makes things 
happen and doesn’t 
give excuses; he goes 
for what he wants.”

In the ensuing 
fame that followed his 
video, the San Diego 
native and his pint-sized co-star 
have been featured on “The Ellen 
DeGeneres Show,” Ryan Seacrest’s 
radio show and NYTimes.com. 

“I warned Ryan, I told him, ‘I 
feel sorry for you, dude,’” Narvaez 
said of the radio segment. “Alexa 
kept playing with the microphone, 
she just wouldn’t stay still. But 
I didn’t mind. I wasn’t going to 
be like, ‘You sit there and play!’ 
Not even Ryan Seacrest is going to 
make me do that.”

Now, the UCSD student has 
been offered everything from 
record deals to Honda commercials. 
And while the tornado of fame has 
been a boon to Narvaez in the past 
month, the father of two has man-
aged to stay grounded. 

“There’s been a lot of crazy 
offers, but I’m gonna be in control,” 
he said. “I don’t want my family to 
become a spectacle. I want this to go 
as far as possible, but as healthy as 
possible. I want to give my daughter 
an opportunity to grow.”

Narvaez said he also doesn’t plan 
on leaving UCSD for the glimmering 
draw of show business anytime soon. 

“The reason this is all happen-

ing is because of my family. I have 
no intentions of moving away from 
it — I have a really strong tie within 
the San Diego and UCSD com-
munity.”

But of course that connection 
doesn’t obligate him to reject every 
offer that comes his way. 

Narvaez has accepted offers 
to play at two upcoming music 
festivals: next month’s San Diego 
IndieFest, as well as South by 
Southwest, which runs March 
11-20 in Austin, Texas. Already a 
published writer, Narvaez has even 
been given a deal to write children’s 
books by Lowenstein Associates, a 
New York-based book agency. 

“I’m going to start writing a series 
of children’s books for 
fathers and daughters,” 
Narvaez said. “I’m real-
ly excited about that.”

Although the 
father of two is thank-
ful for his newfound 
opportunities, he also 
recognizes the fleet-
ing nature of Internet 
stardom. 

“If this is old news 
next week, that’s OK,” 
Narvaez said. He is 
determined to keep 
his head on his shoul-
ders, and with all the 
attention he and his 
family have been get-

ting, Narvaez is cautious to keep 
it on his terms. “I don’t want to 
become a Lindsay Lohan.”

For now, Narvaez is success-
fully landing solo gigs at venues 
like the House of Blues, and even 
has a self-filmed YouTube reality 
show in the works, to be produced 
by the infamous YouTube channel, 
“Shaytards.” And while his new-
found claim to fame is keeping him 
plenty busy these days, fatherhood 
is his top priority. 

“My life is funny,” Narvaez said. 
“These kids are funny. Eliana, she’s 
silent but deadly. She has a long-
term attention span and pays atten-
tion to details. But Alexa is the 
polar opposite; she’s all over the 
place. She says, ‘I wanna be a singer 
like you, Dad!’ or ‘I wanna be a 
photographer!’”

Narvaez says he won’t complete-
ly rule out musical stardom for his 
daughters, but it’s not quite the top 
priority. 

 “First, they have to learn how 
to read.”

INFOCUS WARREN COLLEGE COUNCIL’S “IT ’S A SMALL WORLD” 

Warren College Council brought a free multicultural cel-
ebration featuring dance, food and games to Canyon Vista and 
Warren Lawn on Friday, Feb. 9. This was the first cultural event 
Warren College has hosted this school year.

“It’s a Small World” ran from 6 to 9 p.m., with food from 
Asia, Europe and South America served inside the dining hall 
until its 8 p.m. closing. Dance performances started at 7:30 p.m. 
On the stage, UCSD’s Ballet Folklorico danced in traditional 
Mexican dress, an Irish student group performed a customary 
step dance and Wushu club members showed their skills in the 
Chinese martial art.

Upbeat music blared across the field and various booths 

representing different countries were set up on the sidewalk 
in front of Earl’s Place before the presentations, including an 
origami station and a booth selling traditional Chinese onion 
pancakes for $1 each.

The event started after dark and was plagued by sparse light-
ing, but the stage area was well-lit. Attendance increased as the 
night went on, rising to about 100 people, who came to celebrate 
a variety of world cultures in a single corner of campus.

within five points with just over a minute left to play. 
But the Tritons came up big on the boards, snatching 
three offensive rebounds in one possession to keep 
the ball out of Chico’s hands. In a last-ditch effort to 
extend the game, the Wildcats sent Carlisle and Feder 
to the line on four occasions before the end of the 
game. The juniors sank all eight attempts to finish the 
game with a comfortable 11-point lead.

“We’re in crunch time, our back is against the 
wall and every possession seems enormous,” Elliott 
said. “This team, for whatever reason, likes to make 
it interesting. Chico’s a great team, and I knew that 
if they hit a couple threes and got some momentum, 
things could change in a hurry. But what can I say 
about the fact that we just kept playing? This whole 
weekend was about just finding a way.” 

With this weekend’s results, the Tritons improve 
to 14-4 in the CCAA, moving past Chico State to take 
the third spot in conference standings with just four 
games left in the regular season. The top two teams 
in the conference host the first round of games in the 
CCAA tournament.

The Tritons will finish up their conference match-
es on the road, playing Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Friday, Feb. 18 and Cal State Los Angeles on Saturday, 
Feb. 19.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — After 
a first half characterized by all 
offense, stout second-half defense 
gave the No. 17 UCSD women’s 
water polo team the 8-6 victory 
over Cal State East Bay on Friday. 
The Tritons shut down the Pioneers 
after the break, holding them to just 
one goal.

“This was a huge win for us and 
we talked about it all week,” head 
coach Brad Kreutzkamp said. “It’s 
tough to stay focused when you have 
a big tournament coming up and 
you’re playing five games in three 
days and one of them is against a 
huge conference rival. East Bay is 
going to be there all year and when 
you play them in your pool, you’ve 
got to get that win.” 

The game came one day before 
the Triton Invitational, an annual 
tournament hosted by UCSD and 
featuring some of the best teams in 
the nation. With many of the tour-
nament’s teams in the stands, the 
Tritons did not disappoint, exhib-
iting their explosive, high-scoring 
offensive prowess and their shut-
down defense all in one game.

The game started with the 
Pioneers taking a quick lead by scor-
ing the first goal, but the Tritons 
responded with a goal of their own. 
Neither team took more than a one-
goal lead in the first quarter. 

In the second quarter, the Tritons 
broke out early and scored the first 
two goals of the quarter, setting the 
pace and taking their first lead of 
the night. 

After claiming a 5-3 lead, the 
Tritons slipped and let the Pioneers 
back in the game, giving up two con-
secutive goals. The half ended with 
the score tied at 5.

East Bay scored early in the 
third quarter, but UCSD was able 
to answer. With score tied at 6-6, 
the Triton defense clamped down. 
An ejection by CSU East Bay with 
45 seconds to play led to another 
goal for UCSD, and put them up 
for good.

In the last quarter, UCSD stopped 
everything CSU East Bay tried to 
run, and prevented their counterat-
tack opportunities and shots. Senior 
attacker Hanalei Crowell put the 
game away with an insurance goal. 

Kirsten Bates and Crowell each 
had two goals on the game, with 
Bates scoring both in the first half 
and Crowell’s scores coming after 
the break

With the Tritons playing four 
games at the Triton Invitational, the 
squad is employing a varying rota-
tion every game to get everyone 
some playing time.

“With the long weekend, I have 
them taxed, and then we’d come 
out Sunday in our second game and 
they’d be exhausted if I just went 
with the same six people over and 
over again,” Kreutzkamp said. “So 
I had to get some new people in so 
we’d stay fresh and win some games 
this weekend.”

After beating East Bay, the 
Tritons are 4-2 overall and 2-0 in 
Western Water Polo Association 
play. East Bay fell to 2-3 overall and 
1-1 in conference.

The Tritons fell 11-4 to No. 14 
Hartwick in the first match of the 
tournament before taking down 
Santa Clara 12-10 on Saturday. The 
Tritons then defeated Maryland 
9-5 on Sunday. A full recap of the 
tournament will be available in 
Thursday’s issue of The Guardian.

with 24 seconds remaining. Reserve forward Mike 
Meza was stripped of the ball as the Tritons held for 
the last shot, and Chico sealed the win.

Meza’s turnover was the most costly, but the 
Tritons struggled to keep the ball all game.

“We turned the ball over way too much in the 
second half,” Carlson said. “They had two points off 
turnovers in the first half and 15 in the second half. 
You just can’t do that in this league. You do that and 
you’re going to pay for it, and we did tonight.”

Hatch once again led the way for the Tritons, put-
ting up 16 points and 11 rebounds. Ryan — the team’s 
lone senior — was honored for his Triton career 
before the game, and tallied 16 points, seven boards 
and four assists.

“Casey has come so far as a player,” Carlson said. 
“He’s done a fantastic job leading us this year. Casey’s 

a quiet guy by nature, but when he speaks it’s very 
impactful. And that’s the way I think he’s led us this 
year.”

Carlson said the frustrations that have plagued his 
team comes down to small mistakes with bad timing.

“It’s just been unfortunate we haven’t been able 
to execute at key moments,” Carlson said. “That 
small margin of error that we’ve talked about many 
times has been coming to get us, and it got us again 
tonight.” 

With this weekend’s losses, UCSD drops to 10-14 
overall and 5-13 in conference play. The Tritons will 
look to end their three-game losing streak on the road 
this week, as they travel to Cal State Dominguez Hills 
and Cal State Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday, 
respectively.

said. Last night against Pacific, I dont know 
what our resolve was. Tonight we just were 
resolved to go win. We stepped on the gas and 
never let off. We had a great match start to 
finish. We resolved to be successful and we did 
really well defensively tonight.

Senior middle blocker Calvin Ross led the 
team with .600 hits, followed by sophomore 
outside hitter Carl Eberts, who showed .522, 
with 15 kills, four digs and a block. Junior 
opposite Shane Veiga added 11 kills and three 
blocks, and senior setter Phil Bannan tallied 
42 assists. 

Theyre ranked number four in the coun-

try; they had an 18-match win streak on their

has been very successful on their home court, 
and we defeated the defending national cham-
pion. There are a lot of little feathers in our cap 
that our guys can be very proud of.

This weekend the team returns to RIMAC 
Arena for two more conference games. The 
Tritons will take on No. 2 Long Beach State at

fielders choice.
But Northrop saved the win for the Tritons 

in the 11th, after Saul singled and pinch-
hitter Scott Liske was hit by a pitch. Northrop 
knocked in Saul to give the Tritons the victory.

Elias Tuma got the win after surrendering 
the unearned run in the ninth, and gave up one 
hit in four innings of relief. Guido Knudson was 
denied the win after allowing one run in seven 
innings of work.

In the second game of the day, Daniel 
Simmons pitched a complete game shutout in 
the seven-inning game. Simmons gave up two 
hits and struck out seven batters, and didnt 
allow a base runner until the fourth inning. 

Kehoe ripped a bases-loaded double in the 
fifth inning that scored all three of the Tritons 
runs.

On Sunday, Blake Tagmyer was a double 
short of the cycle and the Tritons held off a 
ninth-inning rally for the win.

The Tritons are now 7-1 on the season, and 
are showing signs of reproducing last seasons 
run to the College World Series.

The teams heard a lot about the guys we 
lost, Saul said. But we got a lot of guys that are 
really hard workers, and they know the level 
that they need to be at. They know the level 
that all the returners want to be at: the World 
Series.

The Tritons open up their conference sched-

ule next weekend, with a four-game series 
against CalState East Bay at home. The first 
game is on Friday at 6 p.m. at Triton Ballpark.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The chances and 
the effort are there, but the UCSD mens bas-
ketball team keeps finding ways to lose close 
games. With two tight losses to Cal State 
Stanislaus and Chico State over the weekend, 
the Tritons have now lost six games this sea-
son by five points or less.

Its unfortunate the way some of our 
games have turned out for us in the last 
month, head coach Chris Carlson said. Im 
really proud of our group, weve had great 
efforts. Its not like we havent played hard, 
and its not like we havent done things weve 
talked about doing.

On Thursday night, Christian Hatch had 
a career-high 28 points, but even that was 
not enough to keep the Tritons from falling 
71-66 to Cal State Stanislaus. The junior 
center scored eight straight Triton points to 
put UCSD up 64-63 with 1:26 remaining, but 
Stanislaus came back with an 8-2 run to fin-

ish the game and take the victory.
Hatch went 11-16 on the game and 

scored 19 points in the second half. His pro-
duction was needed to make up for a poor 
night from the rest of the Triton starters. An 
adjusted starting lineup scored just 21 points 
on an abysmal 5-18 shooting night, strug-
gling on the offensive end all night. Casey 
Ryan, the teams second leading scorer after 
Hatch, managed two points on 0-6 shooting. 

The Tritons lost another game in the final 
minute on Saturday night, as UCSD dropped 
a 60-56 decision to Chico State. 

The Tritons led by eight early in the 
second half, but an 11-0 Chico run erased 
the deficit. The Wildcats built a 56-48 lead 
with just under five minutes left to play, and 
although the Tritons came roaring back and 
closed the gap to one point with 29 seconds 
to play, it wasnt enough to take the game. 

The Tritons were forced to foul to stop 
the clock, and Chicos Sean Park made both 
free throws to give the Wildcats a 59-56 lead

Righty Tim Shibuya pitched six innings and struck out eight in

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 12 UCSD 
men’s volleyball team came back from a tough 
upset against Pacific to sweep No. 4 Stanford 
on the Cardinal’s home court.

On Thursday, the Tritons had their six-
match win streak against Pacific snapped 
when the Tigers won 3-1. Set scores were 
25-22, 25-19, 23-25 and 25-21, and despite a 
third set win the Tritons were unable to take 
the match to five sets.

“The fact that we did come back and win 
game three, that really shows something,” 
head coach Kevin Ring said. “That has been a 
goal of ours in years past: that in every match, 
even if you are losing, can you still go out and 
win at least one game? Even when we won 
that game we weren’t playing great volleyball, 
but we still found a way to win and I definitely 
liked that.”

For the match, UCSD hit .183 and Pacific 

hit .333 and the Tritons showed only 7.5 
blocks to the Tigers’ 17.5. With an additional 
22 service errors, the Tritons had a rough 
night both defensively and offensively.

“There were a couple of areas that were 
really costly for us,” Ring said. “Our 22 service 
errors, it doesn’t matter who you are playing, 
if you miss that many serves in four games 
you are just letting the other team off the 
hook; you’re being too easy on them. I’ve seen 
us play much better than tonight.”

The Tritons bounced back in a big way 
the next night against Stanford University at 
Maples Pavilion. The team had a season high 
.477 hits to take the Cardinal 25-18, 30-28 
and 25-16, and recorded its first win against 
Stanford since 2006.

“I had a quote we talked about for the 
match: ‘always bear in mind that your own 
resolution to succeed is more important than 
any one thing,’ from Abraham Lincoln,” Ring

BASEBALL — The UCSD baseball team picked 
up four more wins this weekend, with 6-1, 3-0, 
3-2, and 7-6 victories over No. 17 Mesa State.

“I thought it was a great weekend overall,” 
head coach Dan O’Brien said. “We played a 
great club. So for us to have a successful week-
end against them I think says a lot about our 
team.”

In the opening game, Tim Shibuya put in 
another solid start, as he gave up five hits and 
no runs in six innings. The senior right-hander 
struck out eight and only walked one, but did 
hit three batters. 

The Tritons scored three runs in the bot-
tom of the first inning, with RBI from Danny 
Susdorf and Evan Kehoe. Kyle Saul also scored 
a run off a double steal. 

“We’ve been working on that all week, get-
ting a good delay at first base and reading it a 
third,” Saul said. “The catcher just didn’t look 
at me, so it was pretty easy for me to walk in.”

The Tritons had 13 hits on the game, but 
left 10 men on base. Mesa tallied eight hits, 
also leaving 10 stranded, but didn’t score until 
a fielder’s choice at the top of the ninth.

In the first game of Saturday’s double-
header, redshirt freshman Jonah Northrop set 
off his Triton career with a bang, as he sent a 
walk-off single into center field in the bottom 
of the 11th inning to give the Tritons the win. 
It was Northrop’s second collegiate at bat, and 
his first hit as a Triton. 

UCSD held a 2-1 lead going into the bot-
tom of the ninth, but gifted Mesa State the 
tying run with two errors and a poorly played

The women’s basketball team picked up its sixth straight win with a 76-68 victory against Cal State Stanislaus and a 
71-60 win over Chico State this week-
end.

On Thursday, the Tritons faced 
CSU Stanislaus, a middle-of-the-pack 
squad currently sitting in seventh in the 
CCAA, four spots behind the Tritons. 
Despite their massive win last week on 
Spirit Night against nationally ranked 
CSU Monterey Bay, the Tritons got off to 
a slow start. Eight minutes into the first 
half, the Tritons had their six-point lead 
erased after three consecutive jump-
ers by Warrior guards Jeanette Rowe 
and Christin Gowan gave Stanislaus 
the lead.  

From there, the Warriors extended 
the lead to as many as eight points, as 
Gowan — who led all scorers with 20 
points off of 8-of-15 shooting — contin-
ued to finish her opportunities.  

The Warriors carried the lead into 
the second period, capitalizing on three 
consecutive Triton turnovers.  

“We came out in the second half and 
I’m thinking, ‘maybe we’re going to turn 
the corner,’” said coach Charity Elliott. 
“Well, we started the second half with 
three turnovers in a row. Timeout, and 
I just said, ‘Guys, sometimes you have 
to grind it out. Sometimes it’s not going 
to be pretty.’” 

The play wasn’t pretty, but the 
Tritons did manage to turn the corner, 
coming out of the timeout with back-to-

back three-pointers from junior guards 
Chelsea Carlisle and Daisy Feder to put 
UCSD back on top.  

The Tritons were able to hold onto 
the lead for the remainder of the game, 
ending the game 76-68, despite 48-per-
cent shooting from the Warriors in the 
second half. The Tritons also sank 12 
of 13 free throws in the final minute to 
keep the Warriors from coming back, 
with Feder hitting eight in a row.

On Saturday against Chico State, the 
Tritons outplayed the Wildcats to take 
their 12th victory out of the team’s last 
14 games.

The Tritons shot an outstanding 
15-of-25 from the field — while also 
sinking seven three-pointers in the first 
half — to amass a 12-point lead by the 

end of the first period.  
Sophomore guard Emily Osga led 

the Tritons in rebounds, collecting 11 
boards, while also putting away four 
three-pointers. Osga finished the game 
with 14 points to pick up her third 
double-double of the season. Carlisle 
finished the night with 17 points, and 
has led the Tritons in scoring for the 
past seven games.

The Triton offense cooled down in 
the second half, going 9-of-31 from 
the field, but were still able to push the 
lead to as many as 17 midway through 
the half.

The Wildcat offense made one last 
push down the final stretch, coming
