BERKELEY - Trying to 
attract more minority stu-

Associated Students of the 
University of California 
(ASUC) Senate has proposed 
offeri ng annual $1,000 schol-
arships to a minimum of 10 
minority students. The bill, 
accordi ng to the ASUC 
Senate, would not conflict 
with Proposition 209 hecause 
ASU is a separate en tity 
from the university. 
Moreover, the fu nds ror the 
scholarships would come 
on ly from profits generated 
by the ASUC store, not rrom 
student fees. cholarship 
winners would be allowed to 
renew their award each year 
provided that they maintain 
at leas t a 2.3 grade point 
average and volunteered at 
least five hours a week to 
recruit other minority stu -
dents to UC Berkeley. After 
graduation, recipients would 
be expected to contribute to 
the scholarship program.

College Plans to 
End Nude Soccer 
DECORAN, Iowa - Hoping 
to avoid the negative attention 
that six students brought to 
Luther College for participat-
ing in nude soccer games, 
Luther College administrators 
have issued a statement that 
they "will not condone nude 
soct:er on the Luther campus" 
thi s year. Last year, an 
unclothed male harassed 
women in a dorm following a 
naked soccer match. Naked 
soccer also sparked a media 
blitz at approximately 1,200 
newspapers across the country 
and world. While some felt 
that the attention was detri-
mental to Luther 's reputation, 
Jerry Johnson, director of 
public information, fe lt that 
the publicity helped dispel the 
unattractive image of Luther 
college as a conservative, 
Midwestern Christian school.

ASIAN AMERICANS AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

Claire Schneider/Guardian 
Caught In the middle?: Asian Americans playa complicated role in affirmative ~ction debates. 

Is Yellow Black or ~fiU@? 
Stereotyped as the 'model minority, ' Asian A mericans occupy a complex position 

By Grace Jang 
Senior Staff Writer 

The recent passage or Propos ition 
209, a.k.a. the "California Civil 
Rights Initiative" (CCRI ), has suc-
cessfully rendered illegal the use of 
affirmative action in employment 
practices and higher educati on admis-
sions policies. Many. including UC 
Berkeley proressor Ron Takaki , are 
currently making efforts to reverse the 
efrects of CCRl . 

Affirmative action proponents say 
that CCRI has detrimentally arrected 
enrollment numbers in higher educa-
tion. 

According to UC Regent Ward 
Connerly, such numbers indicate that 
"affirmative action has all along di s-
crim inated against Asians and 

whites ." Most opponents of affirma-
tive action would concur, including 
many Asian Americans themselves. 
Mixed reactions 

Shin Kim, a UCLA junior, is one 
among many Asian Americans who 
believe that arfirmative action in col-
lege admissions works against Asian 
Amerit:ans, unrairly penali zing them 
for their academic at:hievement at the 
expense of "lesser qualified" racial 
minorities. 

"Afrirmative action probably docs 
help racial diversity [on campusJ, but 
when academics is concerned, racial 
diversity should not be so important," 
Kim said. "Just wanting racial di ver-
si ty is discrimination it se lf. It 's 
racism . But academia should tran· 
scend above all that, right? It should 

be a competition more or the minds, 
not or the races." 

"Esther," a UCLA junior whose 
name has been withheld upon request, 
disagrees. 

"Ir higher education's sole purpose 
was ror academics and reciting racts, 
then we shouldn ' t have affirmative 
action," Esther said. "But, humans are 
made up of different facets - color, 
socioeconomic background - that 
can' t be ex trapolated from higher 
education. These things are very intri -
cately intertwined with academics. 
The reason that people go to school 
- be it for your own selr-interest, ror 
your own self-philosophy, ror a better 
job - in the end, you ' re going to 
have to deal with other people. If you

Diversity in Action Protests Commencement Speaker 
EVENT: Over 100 
students attend protest 
outside Dynes' office 
By Vincent ~ragnanl 
Staff Wnter 

Over 100 students and stafr 
gathered at the chancellor's com-
plex on Thursday to protest the 
selection of Newt Gingrich, speak-
er or the House of Representative, 
as this year's commencement 
speaker The group was also critical 

of the declining number of students 
of color at UCSD. 

The protest, sponsored by 
Diversity in Action, included a 
demonstration on the Library Walk 
and a press conference outside 
Chancellor Robert Dynes' office. 

Anna Eng, a UCSD graduate 
student and teaching assistant, told 
the crowd that the burgeoning 
protest movement at UCSD will 
not cease until Gingrich speaks. 

'This protest will escalate week 
after week," Eng said. "The protest 

'will continue until the moment 
Newt is on the stage." 

Protest organizers gathered out-
side the Price Center at lOa. m. 
with signs and niers, they heard 
from to Warren College Writing-
Series Learning Skills Counselor 
Robert McDonell , who has been on 
strike for 14 days in front of the 
chancellor's complex. 

McDonell said it is important 
that there be unity between memo 
bers of the United States' counter-
culture and members of the politi· 

cal lert. He then said Gingrich's 
views are "based in hatred, bigotry 
and political ideas that should have 
died long ago." 

Protesters chanted "Racist, sex-
ist, anti -gay, Newt Gingrich go 
away," while walking down the 
Library Walk before returning to 
the chancellor's complex by way of 
the Price Center. 

Upon finding Dynes' office

PROTEST: 
Watson addresses 
the large crowd 
Continued from page 1 

So n after th is incident, Vice 
Chance llor of Student Affairs 
Jose ph Watson spoke with the pro-
teslers . 

Allhough he agreed to meet 
wi th students ncxt Friday in the 
Cross Cu lt ural Center, Wat son said 
he did not th ink that Gingrich 
would be removed as commence-
ment speaker. 

When asked ahout such a possi-
bi lity, Wat on responded, "I don ' t 
think so, the campus has made a 
formal commitmenl." 

Associate literature Professor 
Jorge Mariscal told the crowd that 
he believes Dynes caved in to UC 
Regent Ward Connerly in inviting 
Gingrich. 

Watson told protesters that they 
were wrong in accusi ng the univer-
sity of taking money away from 
diversity programs. 

"Nothing could be further from 
the truth," he said. 

A member of the crowd 
responded to Watson's comment by 
ca lling him a "liar." 

"Newt Gingrich is a political 
figure," Watson said. "Some people 
support him very vigorously, some 
people oppose him very vigorously. 

"The invitation was made by the 
chancellor, as chief officer, on 
behalf of the university," Watson 
added. " I hope that no one in 
California would take [Gingrich's] 
being here as a representation of 
UCSD." 

UCSD police officers stood by 
in ca 'e the crowd grew unruly. 

After a press conference, pro-

testers returned to join McDonnell 
in hi s ongoing strike. McDonell 
once again addressed the crowd. 

Turning away fro lll photogra-
phers, McDonell said. "They are a 
corporate media who have ren-
dered themselves irrelevant in the 
strugg les of this country. 

"Gathering signatures wi II not 
accompli sh what you want them to 
accompli sh," McDonell continued. 
" I encourage you to go into [the 
chancellor 's] offi ce, sit down and 
ask him to make a phone ca ll and 
don't leave until he has." 

After the protest, Muir sopho-
more Katie Lane, a member of 
Diversity in Acti on, said she was 
angered by the process of 
Gingrich '5 selection. 

"I was most di sturbed by how 
the speaker was chosen," Lane 
said . "Newt Gingrich is someone I 
never would have asked. We want 
to ensure that there's not a prece-
dent set by thi s. We'd like to imple-
ment a means by which students 

can give their voice III selel.:t ing 
thei r speaker: ' 

Lane also said that she would be 
very i mprcssed i I' Dynes decided to 
a!lcnd the meeting between Watson 
and student s nex t week , 

Mall McDonald, chairman of 
the UCSD College RepUblicans, 
said that he think s that Diversity 
in Action and other groups are 
not really angry with how 
Gingrich was chosen but instead 
by the fact that he was chosen at 
all. 

"Clearly they want a speaker 
who will only reinforce their own 
politica l beliefs," McDonald said. 
"They say they 're protesting the 
way the speaker was chosen, when 
in realit y they're protesting the 
speaker. If it was a procedural 
problem, they would have spoken 
up last year." 

Dynes was on vacation last 
week and unavailable for comment 
on the protest. He is scheduled to 
return to campus today. 

Effort Underway for '98 and '99 Senior

"Right now people fee l indifTer-
cnt about the IUCSDJ campus," 
Whang said . ''The purpose of the 
gift is to unite and create an identi-
ty within the UCSD community." 

Adricn Kohn , campus develop-
ment officc as istant director for

gift becomes a sy mhol of SO's 
pride and schoo l spirit to show th at 
there is more to CSD than just 

demanding academics. 
"Bruins, Trojans, Aztecs - you 

know all of them," Kohn said. 
"But [peopleJ don ' t know what 
UCSD is. The UCSD what'l Sun

Whang said she hopes to 
increase student awarcncss of the

PINION

The nature of man may not be inherently evil, but through 
examining government we discover we are not inherently good 
8yTommy Vu 
Staff Writer 

"The stnle of men wi thout civil 
society (which state we may properly 
ca ll the state of nature) is nothing else 
but a mere war or all against all ," wrote 
Thomas Hohbes in his 1640 philo-
sophica l shocker, Tir e ElelllenlS of 
LlIIv. 

In thi s book, and others h..: penned, 
Hohhe~ tak..:s a long, hard look at 
hUlllan naturc and the laws that relle 't 
it. What J-I ohhcs di sc()v..:red is that we 
are, for thc IllOst pan , a hi ckl:ring and 
ho~t i Ie species. 

"For ev..:n at the time when men arc 
in a tumult .. . they ar<-"'amongst Ihem-
selves in the state of hostilit and ITot 
of peace," Hohhcs wrote. 

Thi s nalUre of human ~ Ihat Hobhes 
wri tes ahou t leads to the qucstion: "re 
we, as (>Cop le, naturally good or evil '! 
Were we born with these predi~posi ­
tions or have they hccn instilled in us 
since childhood'! 

From what I have witne~~l:d in my 
18 years, I am forced to say that I 
believe that humans arc naturally evi I. 

The seven deadly sins 
serve as a constant 
reminder of the 
negative aspects of 
life, while tha seven 
virtues are what we 
should all strive for. 
Yat, It's the sins that 
are more easily 
attainable. 
Well. perhaps evil is too harsh or a 
tcrm. When I think of "evil ," I rel:all 

n;Hlle~ )o, uch as Hitler and Stalin. There 
arc very few who would appreciate 
being associated wi th such monsters. 
Perhaps "natu ra lly bad" might be a 
better terrn. 

The rcason for my maintenance of 
such a pessimistic view of humanity is 
rooled in both hi story and current soci -
ety. onsider the current concept of 
laws and governmenl for a moment. 

Laws and governments arc repre-

sentati ons of what a society views as 
moral and ethical. If humans were nat-
ura lly good, there would be no need 
for restrictions. We would all respect 
each other and all live in peace and 
harmony. But. ohviously enough. we 
do not li ve in peace or harmony. 

The basic MruclUre of our govern -
ment is hased on human fears and 
paranoia. Th..: checks-and-balances 
system among the judicial. exec uti ve 
and legislative hranch..:s works by pit-
ting the hranl:hes against each other. In 
doi ng th is, the people from cach 
branch arc forced to keep an eye un 
those in the other branches for fear of 
losing their own power and inlluence. 

This stri ving for power alw points

Are people inherently good? 
Society's emphasis of the 
constant quest for the 
betterment of mankind 
certainly seems to suggest so 
By Jessica Scheppmann 
Associate Features Editor 

Asked and asked again, delinitively answered and then 
promptly reevaluated, has been the question of whether -
in our hean of hearts - man is essentially good or funda-
mentally ev il. 

To this day, phi losophers have not been able to resolve 
the issue. All conclusions have been a product of the 
answer-seekers' own experiences, but here I will try to 
establish general guidelines applicable to all types of people. 

Firsl, we must define what is good and evil. The only 
logical conclusion to thi s story is that the spelling out of 
what is good and what is bad is based on cultural ideologies. 
Each person is a product of his or her individual experiences 
and, although these experiences are processed similarly, the 
ideals lhat are produced can be quite different. 

Immanuel Kant wrote that the origins of the world were 
in the human mind itself. He said that the mind wasn't a 
blank slate, but instead had an Inherent structure that our 

Individuals are 
good. Group or 
mob mentality, 
such In the case 
of the Nazis, 
can motivate us 
to be bad, but 
even In these 
cases people 
feel like they 
are doing good 
and are working 
for the 
betterment of 
the group. 

individual experiences fil -
' tered through_ In olher 
words, we impose our indi-
vidual ideologies onto rea l-
world phenomena. 

Kant also argued that 
humans had an innate 
awareness of moral law in 
tbe form of an uncondition-
al, ethical bollom line. This 
consists of limitations that 
prevent us from innicting 
pain and sufferi ng on our 
fe llow man, as we ll as com-
milti ng cri mes against 
humanity. 

Outside influences such 
as family ideals, religion, 
governmental authorit y, 
sociocconomic background, 
culture and education all 
shape our perceptions of the 
world . However, man is 

essentially a social creature, and will generally seek accep-
tance. 

Thi s need for acceptance may he fulfill ed through other 
capac it ie~ , or mutated by outside influences, but it i, not a 
reflection of our nature - just of pervened experi ences. 
Usually when an indi vidual is motivated to do wrong, rather 
then h..:lp hi ~ fellow Illan . the person in queslion ha, wlTered 
psychological trauma and cannot he considered represerHa-
tive of the norm. Additionally, the bad qualities he possess-
cs arc frowned upon by ~ociety because we hold ourselves 
up to the expectation that each or us wi ll strive to do good. 

In the end, good and evil wi ll be defincd by cultur,,1 
expect3lions. The need to f'ulfillthese expectati ons, to acl in 
a positivc manner toward your fe llow man. is essentially 
what deline> goodness. It is in our hearts to help, not hun, 
our neighbors. Society has always rewarded positive 
acti ons, and in times of need the ability to work toward a 
utopia based on human kindness has been outl ined as good 
in all culture .

GINGRICH'S PRESENCE AN INCREASE IN INTELLEcruAL DIVERSfIY 
Editor: 

A handful of student radicals, 
aging Marxist professors and 
assorted cranks are upset that 
Speaker of the House Newt Gin-
grich has been invited to speak at 
UCSD's all -campus commence-
ment ("Commencement Controver-
sy," May 4, Gllardian). So what 
else is new? 

Students will protest anything. 
But what's irritating ahout the hul -
labaloo surrounding the Gingrich 
in vi tation is the hypoc risy of the 
student protesters. 

Divers ity in Action 's Katie Lane 
feels - because if she fcels it , it 
mu t be tme - that Gingrich's 
presence is "diametrically 
opposed" to UCSD's hold and 
noble commitment to "create an 
atmosphere that not only mirrors 
the heterogeneity of American cul-
ture, but also leads the way in giv-
ing voice to new schools of thought 
in a variety of areas." 

True enough. Gi ngri ch is surely 
no progressive. His ideas aren ' t 
new. But guess what'! Real diversi-
ty - that 's intellectual diversity, 
not the di singenuous, racist brand 
Lane and her comrades peddle so 
loudly and proudly - means mak-
ing room for the likes of Gingrich 
and hi s hated Republican ilk. 

Is thi s an issue of "student 
rights," as Lane says? Of course 
not. This is about rank and intoler-
ance. Lane and her sophomore 
friends arc a voca l minority of 
intellectual higots, pure and si mple. 

If Diversity in Action believes 
in diversity, a its mouthpiece 
claims, then Gingrich deserves a 

fai r heari ng - the same deferential 
treatment President Clinton was 
accorded last year. 

Ben Boychuk 

Glng,lch Protesters 
Are Hypocritical 
Editor: 

I find it hypocritical to have a 
campus squealing over the se lec-
tion of Newt Gingrich as cOln-
mencement speaker a year after 
President Climon was welcomed 
wi th open arms by this same uni-
vers ity community. 

One of the main reasons Gin-
grich's opponents ci te against hi s 
invitation is th at studcnts did not 
have any input in choosing Ihis 
year 's graduation speaker. Where 
were these people whcn President 
Clinton was invited withollt student 
input to speak at last year's com-
mencement? There were no howls 
of protest as there are today. 

The difference is in Clinton's 
lind Gingrich's politics. The multi-
tude of liberals on thi s campus 
were ti ckled pink to have their lib-
eral poster boy, Clint lln, corne and 
push his agenda at the all -campus 
commencement last year. This year 
a "right -winger" is comi ng and 
now they ' re screaming foul. 

When it 's someone whose poli-
tics they like, it 's line for thc 
administration to choose a com-
mencement speakcr without stu-
denl input. But choose a conserva-
tive, and these same people cry 
about how unfai r it is Ihat students 
didn 't have a say.

student input is imponant in choos-
ing a commencement speaker is 
bCl:ause they hope that student 
input wou ld prevent a conservative 
like Gingrich from speaki ng at thi s 
campus. People like Genoa Fergu-
son said it well : "I' m sure if the 
students had chosen the speaker it 
wou ld not have been Newt Gi n-
grich." What would Ihese people 
say if students did choose Newt 
Gingrich? Student input to them is 
j ust a tool to si lence conservat ives. 

The Ii beral left on t his campus 
doesn 't ha ve to agree with the 
selection of Newt Gingrich as com-
mencement speaker or with his 
political history. J-Iowever, they 

shou ld stop using the argument that 
there was no student input in 
choosing Gingrich when they did-
n't use the same argumelll when 
Clinton, a liheral they like, was 
invited. It is just an example of the 
hypocrisy or Gingrich ' opponents.

Facts Inaccurate In 
Division II Editorial 
Editor: 

Aftcr reading the edi torial on 
April 30, 1998, ["Thanks to (Most 
of) the Facult y for Div. 1/ Support" I 
which expounds the virtues of 
moving to Division 11 , I am grave-
ly concerned regarding the infor-
mati on the Associated Students 
have based their premise on. 

First. it stated that UCSD, with 
over Is.noo students, is too big to 
be a Division III school. Division 
affi li ati on is hased on the size and 
scope of the school's athletic pro-
gram and phi losophy, not the size 
of student enrollment. 

For exam pic, if the Assm:iatcd 
Students based it s theory on the 
size of studen t enro llrnent then 
University of' Pacific (Methodist) 
wi th 2.358 undcrgraduatc students, 
Loyal Marymollnt (Catholic) with 
3,70 1 undergraduate students, Pcp-
perdine (Chu rch of Christ) with 
2,523 undergraduate students, SI. 
Mary 's (Catholic) with 2,662 
undergraduate st udents, University 
or San Diego (Catho lic) wit h 4, 126 
undergraduate students, Univers ity 
of San Francisco (Catholic) with 
4,280 undergraduate students and 
Santa Clara (Calholic) with 4, 103 

undergraduate tudems, have no 
business competing in Division I. 

Let us not forget these small 
church schools are competing with 
the powerhouses or UCLA, 22,4611 
undergrJduate enrollment, and UC 
Berkeley, 19,539 undergrJduatc 
cnrollm..:nl. This is a David and 
Goliath scenario, except in Division I. 

Second, the article states: ''Tri-
ton teams will linally be put into 
conferences with the likes of UC 
Davis, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
Sacramento State and US D." The 
professors arc right in assuming 
that the students may not have thor-
oughly studied the facts before they 
voted because Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, Sacramcnto State and 
USD are all Division I schools. 

UC Davis is the only Division II 
school. Furthermore, UC Davis, 
with an undergraduatc enrollment 
of 16,697, beat Kentucky Wesleyan 
(Methodist), undergraduate enro ll -
ment of 653, in the linals to become 
th" NCAA Division II Basketball 
Champion. (Another David and 
Goliath scenario but in Division II .) 

Knowing the above fa ·ts, how 
can the students believe that the 
move to Division II would elimi -
nate Ihe David and Go liath sce-
nario? Let alone increase school 
spirit and improve the social scene 
by moving to Division II'? 

In my opinion, school spirit can-
nOl he measured by the attendance 
at a school's athletic events. In fact , 
it cannot he measured, for it is in 
the heart and mind of all of us -
students, professors, administrators 
and, of course, the chancellor.

Philosophers from Niccolo

they seem to think that great lead-

We have probably all been

One stand that is hard to 
argue against, though, is thi s: In

ate measures. people show their 
true colors. A doc tor goes 
around a neighborhood, torching 
houses along with their occu-
panl s in Bosnia-Herzegov in a.

In Behemoth, Hobbes di scov-

be naturally bad, but we're sure as 
hell not naturally good. 

work to inslillthese qualities in our 
children so that they will be good 
people. People generally wish for 
acceptance. Therefore, in order to 
gain this acceptance, they will 
respect the needs of their society. 

Survival dictates that we behave 
in a cenain way to maintain reason-
able conditions for living. There-
fore, our motivation to be good is 
inherent because it is linked to sur-
vival and quality of life. Govern-
ment establishes the guidelines for 
appropriate behavior. We respect 
governmental institutions because 
they are based on our need to fol-
low moral values, and to see others 
respect those values. 

So it would seem that, in the 
hean of man, there exists an inher-
ent need to work towards the bet-
terment of mankind. The answer 
that goodness is instinctual is obvi-
ous. We are not bad, because good-
ness is a necessary factor to our 
quality of life, and the standards 
we respect in society.

than any athletic event or NCAA 
Championship Title. 

It was only a few years ago UC 
Davis moved to Division D with-
out scholarships. Now, according 
to UC Davis 's website: "To sup-
port student scholars who are also 
talented athletes, the campus 
recently launched a grants-in-aid 
program, the first in its history." 
Can't we lcarn from UC Davis that 
moving to Division D is not the 
answer? This is proof that moving 
to Division D without scholarships 
is just a myth. In addition, UC 
Riverside, as of April 17, 1998, 
has moved to Division r. 

As students, we can not com-
prehend the ramification of thi s 
move on the future of UCSD. It 
should be the decision of our pro-
fessors, who have the knowledge 
and the experience to ascertain 
the best course for UCSD.

Monday, May II , 1998 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 7 

COMMENTARY: By breaking through the barrier of closed-minded pubJic policy, Hi11ary Clinton has brought us a message not 
just about the future of the Middle East but a reminder of the necessity for ubiquitous human compassion as well 

WHEN THE FiRST LADY SPEAKS, WE SHOULD LISTEN 
By Jessyca Wallace 
Associare Opinion Ediror 

On Thurs., May 7. I came horne 
rrom a grueling day, exhausted and 
hungry, and crashed on my couch 
to walch a few minutes of the news 
before foraging for food . One or 
the most appalling Ihings I've 
heard in a long time crossed over 
Ihe airwaves, ri ghl smack into my 
li ving room, of all places, and 
assaulted me in so many ways I'm 
not sure 1 can count that high. 

Earlier in the day, Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton, in speaking to young 
Israeli s and Palestinians via satel-
lite. claimed that, "The territory the 
Palestinians currently inhabit , and 
whatever additional territory they 
will obt ain through the peace nego-
tiations, should be considered and 
evolve into a functioning modern 
state .... " 

In response to thi s statemenl , 
White House spokesman Mike 
McCurry stood in front of a room 
chock-full of reporters claiming in 
no uncertai n terms that Ihe words 
that fall oUl of Rodham Clinton's 
mouth mean nothing to the policy 
makers of this country. 

Excuse me? Did he say what I 
Ihink he said? Did thi s man just gel

on nalional television, the 6 o'c lock 
news no less, and claim that the 
first lady is merely a windbag'! I 
believe he did . I suppose it really 
doesn' t matter if that was hi s inten-
tion or not - I. and probably 
countless others, interpreted hi s 
slatements to mean that. After all , 
perceptions are far more often whal 
define our world and our attitudes 
than are actual racts. 

I have never been a major sup-
porter of Rodham Clinton. I typi-
ca lly find her \0 be an over-intel-
lectuali zed mega lomaniac who, 
through care ful planning, has-
found her way into the White 
House in the mosl powerrul way a 
woman can in today's sociely. I 
find , however, that when the White 
House offi cially contradicts and 
belittles slatements made by Rod-
ham Clinton on national telev ision, 
thai a grave injuslice is being com-
mitted. This is the first lady, ideally 
the most importanl and influential 
woman in Ihis country and, more-
or- less, the world. 

When the wife, and undoubted-
ly more intelligent half, of the Pres-
idenl or the Uniled States speaks to 
an international audience, you can 
be damned sure what she says is 

Ironically, both .,de. 
are fighting for the 
same thing - each 
want. It. own land 
- however, both 
sides are too mired 
in self-appreclatlon 
to under.tand that 
the other group Is 
just as entitled to a 
homeland. 
eX lremely well thought -out , is 
important to many people who live 
in this country and is most likely 
more intelligentl y reasoned than 

anything that comes from one of 
those damned polil icians in Ihe 
White House. 

Publicly denying Rodham Clin-
ton's competence <l!1d her ri ghl 10 
express her opinions is not only 
ofrensive to Rodham Clinton, but it 
is denigrating to all women. II has 
been noled by ReUlers Ihat "U.S. 
first ladies are usually careful 
either to express the policy of the 
administration or keep their opin-
ions 10 themselves, especially on 
roreign arfairs." 

This is a hislorical reference and 
well, limes, Ihey arc a changin '. 
Women and wives are no longer 
subordinale to Iheir husbands. By 
indicating that Rodham Clinton is 
not capable of expressing a differing 
opinion than that of her husband, 
McCurry has indicaled Ihat women 
in general are still thought of as suh-
ordinale - isn ' tlhis the '90s? 

Another aspeci of thi s Ihat rea l-
ly sti cks in my craw is thai Presi-
dent Clinton has nOI come IO' Rod-
ham Clinton 's defense on thi s 
issue. While I am normall y an avid 
Sli ck-Willy supporter, I have to 
say I am ralher di sappoinled. This 
is a woman who publicly supports 
her somewhal-crooked, philander-

ing husband consistently and sto -
ically. She has publicly stood 
behind him on every accusation 
ever unleashed upon him - a bas-
tion of undying support . One of 
Ihe seldom times Rodham Clinton 
lakes a little heat comes around 
and we have not heard a word 
r rom I he big cheese! I feel t hat the 
very least he could do is make a 
stalemenl rcgarding her compe-
tence and good intent. 

Beyond all of Ihat, the biggest 
problem with what happened last 
Thursday is that Rodham Clinton is 
right. The Palestinians deserve 
their own state. The United States 
has taken a position to guide the 
peace talks, but not to be directly 
involved - by which I'm serious-
ly confused - yet its official posi -
tion says nothing of the establish-
ment of a Palestinian state. 

The bottom line is Ihi s: people 
are people, and if the Jews and the 
Israeli s dese rvc a homcland, so do 
the Palestinians. Basic human 
needs arc most regularly recog-
nized as food, shelter and love, but 
a highly neg lected one is the need 
ror security and sa rety. All human 
beings arc enlitled to a haven, a

PALESTINE: 
All people deserve 
their own homeland 
Continued from .... e 7 
safe-housc if you will. Palcstinians 
are people too. 

The biller confli ct between the 
Palestinians and the Jews erupted 
thousands of years ago when a 
Hebrew tribe seuled in the modem 
town of Nablus, claiming it as its 
holy land, the Land of Canaan. 
Many centuries of conquer and 
rebellion ensued, and in 70 A.D., 
Judea was invaded by the Romans. 
The Jews were exi led again, their 
Temple burned and their land 
renamed Palestine. 

After nearly two millennia of 
rule by Romans, Christians and 
Muslims, a Zionist movement was 
founded with a politica l agenda 
aimed at rec laiming the land and 
establishing a Jewish national tate 
in Palesti ne. Half a century later, 
the State of Israel emerged as a 
Jewish homcland. 

In 1949 a cease- fire was 
dedarcd between Israe l, Egypt, 
Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. 
Israel claimcd more land, Jordan 
took control of somc and Egypt 
gained somc land as well. The 
Palestinians now found themselvcs 
without a homeland. 

Thc 50 years of war following 
the state's emergence ha ve been 
plagued by bitler struggles and

continuing battl es between the 
Palestinians and the Israe li s. Ironi-
cally, bolh sides are fighting for the 
same thing - eacl1 wants its own 
land - howe ver, both sides arc too 

mired in self-appreciation to under-
stand that the other group is just as 
entitled to a homeland. Sadly, it 
really shouldn' t take guns and 
bombs to re(;ogni zc the incongru -
encies involved in the Jews having 
a homcland and the Pales tini ans ' 
lack thereof. 

It is di heartening to know that 
my people have had to fight for so 
long to get someth ing so essential. 
that so many Jews died in the wars 
to gain a homeland and that after 
all of our suffering we can not 
extend to the Palestinians the cour-
tesy of givi ng them their own land 
- both for their benefit and to end 
the senseless killing.

where we supposedly believe all 
human beings equal, yet our gov-
ernment docs not publicly support 
the establishment of a Palestinian 
state and that they feel it necessary 
to rid icule anyone who suppons 
sueh,an eventuality. 

Rodham Clinton ha broken the 
taboo. She has said aloud what so 
many of us have said in our hearts. 
She has made a statement not just 
about the sta te of affairs in the Mid-
dle East, bUl also about the human 
condition. The first lady has shown 
us that understanding and kindness 
wi II gel us further and help more 
people than binemess and se lfi sh-
ness. Now if only Netanyahu and 
Arafat can accept what she said and 
put the pa t behind them.

ASIAN AMERICANS ARE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE

ti me trying to learn it once yo u're in the real world." 

Some Asia n Americans believe Ihat because they 
are qualified, they do not need affirmati ve ac ti on. 
Affirmative-ac tion opponents assert that Asian 
Americans don' t need "set-asides," "do le-out s" or 

"Think abou l it , society is not going to evolve if 
everyone's caught up in se lf-interest," Dav id con-
tined. "A philosopher we're study ing in AP Euro-
pean history sa id that you have to look at the gen-
era l wi ll of society. not just the individual. 

"preferent ia l treatment" as they 
will "succeed on merits alone." 

"Meril is a misleading ideal," 
said one UCS D senior. who 
works for The Princeton Rev iew. 
"Test scores and grades aren' t 
the hest way to measure a per-
son's int elligence nor potential." 

Tae Chung, a UCLA junior, 
echoes the sent iments of many 
As ian American college students 
on the issue of affi rmati ve ac ti on 
in education. Chung fee ls that 
affirmative action does not great-
ly affect Asian Ameri cans either 
way. 

"I used to be aga insl it, then 
for it , now I don' t know," Chung 
sa id. "The reason J was opposed 
[0 it was because I wa nted every-
one who got in,lo get in on their 
merits, not because of color, but 
then after I someone J ex plained 
to me, I was for it. 

"People in the inner cit y have 
it hard and need affirmati ve 
acti pn to get out of there, go to 
college and go back 10 change 
things," Chung continued. "I like 
the J racialJ diversit y on campus, 
but I don' t know how I fcc I 
about it now." 

" 'ot to put down blacks and Latinos or any-
thing, but I' m probably goi ng to have more oppor-

"Yellow Is 
emphatically neither 
white nor black; but 
insofar as Asians and 
Africans share a 
subordinate position 
to the master class, 
yellow Is a shade of 
black, and black, a 
shade of yellow. We 
are a kindred people, 
African and Asian 
Americans •••• We

oppression In the 
United States,

as slave and cheap 
labor, as peoples 
excluded and 
absorbed, as victims 
of mob rule and Jim 

tunities than them," he said. ;'I' m 
doing okay academica ll y 
[because J J don' t have to work 
my ass off at some job to help 
out my family. I don' t have to 
worry about basic surviva l. 
Because of that, I'll give up my 
scat at a UC hecause I can proh-
ably get in other places." 
Affirmative action - a "black 
vs. white" Issue? 

Some believe th at Asian 
Americans should not be associ -
ated with aflir mati ve ac ti on 
because it is needed primaril y hy 
Afri can Americans or Latinos -
and for Asian Americans to he 
lumped into t hat same category 
is a stigma. 

In his essay, "Is Yellow Bl ack 
or White?" (from Margins and 
Maills/realll s: Asians ill AlI1eri-
can His/ory and Cui/li re), Cor-
nell pro fessor of hi sto ry Gary 
Okihi ro cites evidence from the 
past to argue that Asian Ameri-
cans share a "kinship of oppres-
sion" with black Americans. 

"Yellow is emphatica ll y nei-
ther white nor bl ack; but insofar 
as Asians and Afri cans share a 
subordinate position to the mas-

oppose affirmative ac tion 
because it hurt him individuall y. 

"It would piss me off knowing Ihat 1 could l os~ 
my spot at Berkeley hecause some Lati no or hlac k 
guy with a lower SAT and lower GPA got it, just 
because he's Latino or Bl ack and I'm Korean:: 
David said . "But you can' t j ust keep looki ng at it 
from an individual standpoint. I had an epiphany, a 
moment of cla rit y.

Asians and constitutes the essential site of 
Asian Ameri can oppression.

Is yellow black or white? 

"1 never rode the city buses 
when I allended the Univer-
sity of Louisvi li e in Ken-
tucky," wrote Chang-Lin 
Tien. former chancellor of 
UC Berkeley, in an arti cle 
for Comlllon Ground, a 
L.E.A.P. publ ication. 

"It was not simply the 
lack of money that forced 
me to walk ... Rather, J 
refused to ride the buses 
because I found it humili at-
ing. Today, I can still recall 
my shock when I !irst board-
ed a city bus and found that 
whites rode in the fro nt and 

"I never rode

"Model minority" - myth 
or reality? 

Okihiro said that the 
myth of Asian Americans 
as \lle "model minority" is 
one way in which whites 
have pi lled As ians agai nst 
blac ks and other people of 
color. 

A poster created during 
the 1990 L. A. riots of 
reads: "Crac k, the' housing 
cri sis ' and Korean mer-
chant s is [sicl a conspi racy 
to destabili ze our commu-
nit y.. . The Korea n mer-
chants are agents of the 
U.S. government in their 
conspiracy to destabi lize 
the economy of our com-
munity." 

In?" 

'coloreds' 
rode in the rear. Just where exactly did an 
Asian fit in '?" 

"Yellow is not white," Okihiro wrote. 
"But yellow is not black either. and the 
question posed is. in a rea l sense. a fal se 
and mystifying propos ition. 

"The questi on is onl y valid wi thin the 
meanings given to and played out in the 
American racia l forma tion. relations that 
have been posited as a black and white 
dyad. 

"There are other options. Whites con-
sidered Asians ' as blacks,' but whites 
imported Chinese prec isely becau se they 
were not blacks and were thus perpetual 
ali ens. 

"Similarly, whites upheld Asians as 
'near-whites' or ' whiter than whites ' in the 
model minority stereotype. and yet Asians 
continue to face white racism ' like blacks' 
in educational and occupational barriers 
and ceilings and in anti-Asian abuse." 

In a June2 1. 197 1,art i-
cle, Newsweek magazine 

- Chang-Un Tlen quoted social sc ientist 
Forrner chancellor Harry Kitano as saying, 

UC Berkeley "Scratch a Japanese Ameri -
can and you find a WASP." 

According to Newsweek, Asians have 
"outwhited the whites ." 

Tire Wall Slreet lou rnal edi tori ali zed 
on May 30. 1995, that " if the vas~ majori-
ty of American homes we re still employ-
ing the kinds of values that most Asian 
immigrants have brought with them and 
kept th rough one or more generations. we 
mi ght not be havi ng a quota debate in the 
United States." 

What both Newsweek and the Wall 
Street Journal fail to mention is that the 
success stories they highli ght are not 
indi cative of all Asian Americans by far. 

The "model minority" construct fails 
to account for the numerous Asians who 
do not enjoy middle-class status. 

Furthermore, the " model minorit y" 
myth is a stereotype based upon general -
izations made about speci fi c Asian groups 
(mainly Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean and 
South Asians) and fallaci ously applied to 
all Asian Ameri cans. 

The stereotype 
fail s to account for 
the Hmong, Thai, 
Cambodian , Samoan, 
Guamanian. Laotian 
and other Asian 
Paci fi c Islanders -
many of whom are 
severely underrepre-
sented demographi -
ca lly on UC campus-
es, vis-a-vis their 
total popul ation in the 
state. 

Some say th at 
bccause the "model 
minorit y" stereotype 
is a benefi cent one, 10 
refute it or attempt to 
debunk it would he 
foo li sh. 

"Wh at's so bad 
ahout everyone think-
ing that Asians are all 
smart , get good 
grades and succeed T' 
said Richard Lee, an 
exchange student 
from .South Korea. 
" \t. a good thing." 

Sou rces respond 
that Ihe stereotype, as 
with any stereotype, 
is harmful in that it 
homogeni zes a very 
di verse group, st ig-
mati zes as anomalies 
those who fail to pre-
scribe to the mold and 
renders obsolete the 
entrenched history of

Nguyen, a UC Berkeley alumnus. 

"Two people as different as a million-

namesc war orphan arc lumped together 
under the Asian American rubric," he said . 

Asian Ameri cans are both "helped" 
and "hindered" by anirmative action. says 
J.D. Hokoyama, president of Leadership 
Education for Asian Pacifics, Inc. (LEAP) 
Asian Pacific Ameri can Public Policy 
Institute. 

"While some Asian Pacific American 

groups are well-represented at Ivy League 
universi ties, others who are less fortunate 
struggle to overcome the model minority 
stigma and are enabled by affirmati ve 
e fforts to allend local colleges at minimal 
expense," Hokoyama said. 

Asian Americans have not always com-
prised a majority of student body popula-
tions in prestigious universities. 

In 1860, California barred Asian Amer-
icans from anending its public schools 
entirely. After this was ruled unconstitu-
tional , the State set up a system of "orien-

elcome to the Eleventh AnnuaL UCSD Undergraduate Research 
Conference. 

The purpose of UCSD's Annual Research Conference is to 
recognize the outstanding schoLarLy work produced by our 
undergraduates and to stimulate additional interaction between 
students and faculty at the research leveL. Another goal is to 
encourage more undergraduates to pursue doctoral degrees and 
careers in research and college teaching. 

A total of9O students will be presenting papers at the conference 
this year. All participants have been nominated by a member of the 
faculty who has judged their work to be outstanding. All students 
will be awarded a certificate as a research scholar. 

The conference is organized into J 5 small roundtable discussions. 
At each roundtable, five to seven students. will present their papers 
with one or more faculty members serving as moderators. Each 
student has 15 minutes to discuss his or her paper and 5 minutes to 
answer questions. After all presentations are completed, there will 
be additional time for group discussion. Students will present their 
papers at either a morning or afternoon roundtable. During the 
session when they are not presenting, students wiLL attend a 
roundtable of their choice as a member of the audience. 

This conference was made possible by generous support from the 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Joseph Watson, and the Senior 
Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs, Marsha Chandler. The 
annual UCSD Undergraduate Research Conference is planned and 
coordinated by Academic Enrichment Programs.

Sexual assault is one 
of the most common 
crimes committed against 
women in our country. In

percent of female slu-
dents on wllege campus-

rape, and I I percenl were

The problem of sexual 
assault is an importanl 
concem for ollicials on 
college campuses around 
the country. What can 
women do to protect 
themselves? For some, 
Ihe answer is to join a 
self-defense class. 

With such a large

Psycho Therapy 
Our Intrepid Writer Wonders if the General Craziness in the 
World Today Is a Sign of Something More Apocalyptic 
By Mary HIggins Senior Staff Writer 

I darted unhappily through the 
rain Ihis morning, wishing winler 
quarter would end already. Sudden-
ly, I realized it was spring quarter, 
and there was only a month left 
until summer vacation. 

At this time last year it was so 
hot you could fry an egg on the ten-
nis courts. I got "shvitzy" just 
walking from the Price Center to 
Warren Lecture Hall. I remember 
the only thing worse than sitting 
through lecture was unsticking the 
back of my legs from the seat after-
wards. 

This year I have to wonder. 
Summer is almost upon us, and I 
am sitting here bundled up in a ski 
jacket. The foul chill that damp-
ened my Cinco de Mayo spirit and 
'dropped an onslaught of hail onto 
my newly washed car is very 
inconvenient. I don't own a calen-
dar - I keep track of time by the 
weather cycle. If it's warm, then it's 
summer. If it's cold, it's winter. 

This unreasonah ly icky weather 
has me and the rest of the natural 
world run amok . The butterflies are 
huddled together in knit caps and 
slippers. The groundhog has gone 
hack into hibernation. 

My mom ca lled me to say that 
two tornadoes touched down in my 
homctown last wcek, ripping the 
tops off of several houses. That 

wou Idn 't be all that unusual, except 
I'm not from Kansas, I'm from just 
outside of San Jose, California. 

A tornado in California? 
I can just see it now - "Like, 

it's a twister, dude! Totally grab 
Toto!" 

1 find the whole state of affairs 
quite alarming. 

Tornadoes, earthquakes, Newt 
Gingrich - it definitely might be 
the end of the world. Famine? Got 
it. Pestilence? Check. Billion-ton 
comet hurtling towards Earth? Yep. 

I'm currently waiting for the sea 
to tum into blood. I'll keep you 
updated. 

So what should we be doing in 
preparation for the apocalypse? 
Praying? Studying harder? Cutting 
baek on our drug use? 

In case .some of you feel the 
need to save your souls, here are a 
few suggestions: 

( I ) Call your mom and apolo-
gize for forgetting about Mother's 
Day. She's your mom ... she ' ll for-
give you even if the man above 
doesn't. 

(2) Stop stealing stuff' Do you 
know what it 's like to unloek your 
car in the morning - ready to pop 
your TOlally '80s album into the 
stereo - only to find that there's a 
huge canyon in your dashboard 
where your stereo used to be'? 

Summer Is almost 
upon us, and I am 
sitting here bundled 
up In a ski Jacket. 
1IIe foul chili that 
dampened my Cinco 
de Mayo spirit and 
dropped an 
onslaught of hall 
onto my newly 
washed car Is very 
Inconvenient. I don't 
own a calendar - I 
keep track of time 
by the weather 
cycle. If It's warm, 
then It's summer. If 
It'. cold, It's winter. 
1111. unreasonably 
Icky weather has me 
and the re.t of the 
natural world run 
amok. 
Shame on you , car thieves. 

(3) SlOp being so bitchy. I want 
to enjoy my last days left on the 

planet. 
(4) Settle unfinished scores. You 

know how you've always wanted to 
tell your roommate off once and for 
all? Do it. Tell him to stop avoiding 
the dishes because he "has 
midterms." Big deal. We all have 
midterms. (This does not fall under 
the category of "Being Bitchy." It 
falls under the category of 
"Defending Your Rights"). 

(5) Live out your longtime, 
secret fantasy of becoming an exot-
ic dancer. Beller do it now, because 
you won't get a chance to do this in 
heaven. 

Whether or not the "en'd is 
near," I think these small affirma-
tions will improve the quality of 
life. Or at least my life. If we are 
ahout to be destroyed by an 
omnipotent force, I just hope that it 
happens either (a) before my final s 
or (b) after vacation (I want one last 
summer of reckless indulgence). 

On a differ'em note. bow down, 
because here comes the Sun God I 
Our annual festival is on ly days

psyched. I want to point out there 's

just drinking. Make it your goal 
this year to appreciate the Sun God 
Festival for what it is - a day of 
celebration, a day of unity, a day 
of.. .. OK fine, go get hammered. 

Just don't throw up on me, OK? 
I also have one more UCSD-

oriented plug - graduation day is 
approaching us soon, and some 
people are disappointed in the 
selection of this year's com-
mencement speaker (a certain 
Speaker of the House who shall 
go unnamed). 

Of my acquaintances whom are 
graduating, I have yet 10 hear any 
enthusiasm about the all-campus 
ceremony, and I'm sure thaI every-
one has nOliced the various strike-
and-rally-related activities. 

While I commend the protesters 
for standing up for their beliefs, I 
hope that there are no hard feelings 
caused by the dispute. Graduation 
is a well-deserved day of celebra-
tion for the class of 1998, and I 
truly hope that no one - neither 
the protesters nor the EO.N. 
(Friends Of Newt) - will interfere 
with that. 

Next year maybe the class of 
1999 will have a say in who speaks

women need to be particularly cau-
tious. 

The students are also taught 
how to protect themselves from 
attackers. They learn some relative-
ly simple moves and are pai red 
wi th a partner up to go over the 
motions. Merritt teaches reac-
tionary moves because often during 
attacks, there is not a lot of time to 
think. 

Surprisingly, 80 percent of all 
as~ailants do not attack with a 
weapon, so a lot of the moves deal 
with unarmed attacks. The key is to 
use the attacker' s strength and 
weight against him . The moves tar-

their ass." 

Siobhan Keney

"I don 't think it 's very 
effective in actually 
helping them fight or 
defend themselves, but it

of control." 

Philip Hau

"I don't believe self-. 
defense classes are helpful 
because in a situation like 
that, where you 're going to 
be so flustered, you don' t 
have the time to think."

The Editor's Soapbox 
Parking Lot Nirvana and Other Tales of 
Life, Death, Humility and Self-Realization 
By Tarry Law, Editor in Chief 

Sometimes you're just walking 
along, minding your own business, 
when life comes along and smacks 
you upside the head - usually 
when you' re icaSI expecling iI, bUI 
when you need il Ihe mosl. 

I was pushing my shopping can 
Ih rough Ihe COSICO parking lot the 
OIher day when [ had what alco-
holics ca ll a moment of clarity. II 
was just a fler that freak storm last 
week, Ihal lime in the afternoon 
when iI'S almos t but not quile 
evening, that magica l part of the 
day when iI's neither ni ght or day, 
when everything slips away in the 
face of nature's beaut y .. . yes, in a 
parking 101. 

[ was thinking to myse lf about 
how much my life stinks, aboul 
how nothing is going my way, 
when I had the sudden realization 
that I' ve got a lot to be thankful for. 
Sure, I' ve gOI prohlems - I failed 
a midterm a couple of days ago, I 
haven' t slept in a week and women 
tend to run away sc reaming when-
ever [ cross some invisible 50-yard 
line. Still , things could be worse. 
Much worse. 

I've got friends, I've got family 
and I' ve got a great job lined up for 
me after I graduate. I've managed 
to avoid the poorhouse, despite the 
UC Regents' best efforts, and I've 
ju t resolved a problem with a pro-
fessor that's been hangi ng over my 
head for these last few weeks. All 
in all, life is pretty damn good.

abo ut whal cou ld happen nex t

should be focusing on what we can 
do loday and tomorrow. 

Each of us should find somc-

it. Whether it 's nying ki tes, pro-
gramming computers, wri ting poet-

he replied that he had made a per-

work ing for Uncle Sam in Vietnam. 

When Jeff returned to San

By Kacle Jung 
Staff Writer 

In a three-part series concerning 
car maintenance and what to do in 
case of emergencies, our reporter 
discusses variol4s steps drivers call 
take to maimain their cars arul 
ensure tlrei r own safety. This week, 
we discuss carjacking and what lO 
do during a traffic stop. 
Carjacking 

There is always the fear of bei ng 
carjacked while stopped at a traffic 
signal or while walking to your car. 
There is no surefire way to prevent 
carjacking, but there are ways to 
ensure your own personal safety. 

When approaching your car, 
always have your keys in hand. 
According to UCSD police Officer 
Lamine Seck a, many carjackings 
occur because the victim takes too 
long to open hi s or her car door. 
Periodically check the tires and 
wheels, test the lights and gauges, 
and always li slen for weird noises 
while driving. 

Once you are in your car, safely 
fasten your seatbelt and keep your 
doors locked and your windows 
rolled up. While driving, check your 
mirrors frequently for suspicious 
vehicles or pedestrians around you. 
This becomes especially important 
whi Ie waiting at a traffic signal. 

If worst comes to worst and 
someone jumps in and demands 
your keys. give them up. It may 
sound terrible, especially if you arc 
emotionally attached to your car, 
but your Ii fe is more important than 
a hunk of metal. 
Being Pulled Over 

Have you ever heard that story 
where late at night a woman was 
pulled over by what she thought was 

-a police car, but it turned out that the 
other person was not actually a 
police officer? That scenario was a 
reality in San Diego in January 
1997, when a man posing as a police 
officer - complete with fake uni -
form and badge - used hi s black-
and-white-striped car with flashing 
red lights on the dash to pull over 
two people in separate incidents. 

Both times, the man pointed a 
gun at the drivers and demanded 
cash. The first driver gave up 
$280, but the second was ab le to 
fight him off and escape. The 
imposter was never caught. This 
sort of fraud is uncommon, but 
everyone does need to be aware of 
their surroundings. Here are some 
Ihings to be aware of and basic 
directions 10 follow when being 
pulled over: 

First, in California, any police 
car used for traffi c enforcement 
must have a fl ashing red light. The 
officer may use a siren as well . 
Most police cars have nashing red 
and blue lights mounted on top of 
the vehicle, but any car used to pull 
over motorists must have the red 
lig ht on during the stop. 

Second, if you are in a remote 
area and do not feel comfonable

roundings, you can continue dri-
ving until you reach a gas station, 
well-lit parking lot or other area 
where you feel safe. However, if 
you do not stop immediately and 
instead choose to keep dri ving, be 
prepared to face the consequences. 

Always follow instructions when 
stopped. You will likely be asked to 
tum otT your engine, but only do so 
when you are positive that the stop is 
legitimate - especially if you are by 
yourself late at night. Genuine police 
officers wear full uniforms with 
badges and identifying shoulder 
patches, and you can always ask to 
see an official [D. [n addition, every 
patrol car has its agency's seal on the 
front doors, 

If you ever have any problems 
that you fee l requires police atten-
tion, please call the UCSD police at 
(6 19) 534-HELP, or the San Diego 
police at (6 19) 531-2000. [n an 
emergency, always dial911. 
Car Clinics 

Hopefully, everyone who has 
followed thi s series knows more 
about car mai ntenance and basic 
safety issues than when Ihey start-
ed. Anyone interested in leaming 
more about automobiles might 
want to sign up for one of the 
Women's Center car clinics. 

Nancy Wahlig, director of Ihe 
Student Safely Awareness Pro-
gram, and Nancy Loevinger, direc-
lor of the Women's Center. said 
they have been very pleased with 
the attendance at the car clinics. 

The workshops are quarter! y, 
a~d the next one is scheduled for 
thi s fall. If you have any questions,

"Please, please, keep the article 
about me short and non-effusive," 
he said. "I've been lucky in life and 
don' t want to be a braggadocio." 

Jeff is one of the most down-
to-earth , low-key people I know. 
He's led an amazing life, shaping 
public policy in San Diego and 
working every day to make the 
world a better place. He's dedi-
cated hi s life to helping other peo-
ple however he can, and he has 
touched my life and thosc of 
many others without even realiz-
ing it. 

Some people would take the 
occas ion of thei r retirement to 
talk for hours about what they 've 
done and how much they've 
accomplished, but not Jeff. Sofl-
spoken by nature, you could call 
him modest to a fault - some-
thing the rest of us might want to 
emulate. He'd probably be morti -
fi ed if he knew I was wriling this 
piece about him, but [just thought 
that letting him slip quietly away 
into the sunset would be a shame. 

One of the things Jeff lold me 
struck a chord more than anything 
else - as a gay man, he's been 
interested in AIDS since the earli -
est day of the epidemic. He's 
worked on the front lines, carried 
picket signs and participated in 
protes!s, all the while working for 
the county. 

He said the mosl meaningful 
involvement for him, however, 
was the opportunity to spend time 
with seriously ill friends and sup-

reached three figures ." 

1 wonder, every now and 
again, just how [ became involved 
with AIDS. [ don' t k.now anyone 
who has died from the disease, 
and I hate office politics with a 
passion reserved for few other 
things. The Office of AIDS Coor-
dination itself is re[atively apolit-
ical, but the environment it oper-
ales in is one of the most political 
imaginable - we administer mil-
lions of dollars of federal funds 
for A[DS care and treatment pro-
grams, and just what do you 
expect when you're dealing with 
money and people's lives? 

Power struggles aside, I love 
my work. I sleep less, eat less and 
work harder than [ ever have 
before, but I'm having the time of 
my life. The work itself is reward-
ing, both personally and profes-
sionally, and the people [ meet are 
the best pan of the job. Everyone 
has a story to tell , whether they 
realize it or not, and I love to hear 
what makes other people tick. 

By volunteering wherever [ can 
and by working for the Office of 
AIDS Coordination, [ like to think 
that I'm doing some good. 1 may 
not find lhe cure for AIDS, and my 
actions may not amount to squat in 
the linaltally ofthings, but [do the 
best [ can. For better or worse, 
that's all anyone can ask - and in 
the end, it's all that matters.

Underdog Tritons Can't Pull Off Upset 
BANANA SLUGS: UC Santa Cruz, one of the most dominant teams on the West Coast, ended UCSD's successful season 
By Bill Burger 
Staff Writer 

Every David has hi s Goliath , 
every Holylield hi s Tyson, every 
America its England. The improba-
ble victories that these and 
other underdogs accom-
plished have been hailed 
as miracles and placed into 
historical lore , their stories 
used as proof that the 
impossible is in fact possi -
ble. 

Despite the emotions 
that these unlikely heroes 
evoke, we have to realiLe that they 
arc underdogs for a reason. More 
often than not such over- matched 
people or groups put up thei r best 
fight , only to eventually realize that 
it simply isn't enough. 

The Tritons came to thi s realiza-
tion after an emotional 1-6 season-
ending loss to UC Santa Cruz on 
Saturday. 

Despite the 7-0 loss they suf-
fered to the Banana Slugs earlier in 
the year, all talk leading up to the 
match was on strategies to upset 
the Western Regional juggernaut. 

Santa Cruz and its dominant 
doubles teams approached the dou-
bles sets confidently. UCSD 
showed them that they were not 
unbeatable, keeping all three sets 
close before falling. 

Steve Shabel and Emil Mihet 
had a tough assignment at No. I 
doubles, playing against the West 
Regional champions Brian Cum-

mings and Thomas Oeche!. The 
match ended in a tough -8 loss for 
Mihet and Shabe!. 

Ken Liu and Ant hony 
Melicharek fought hard at No. 2 

doubles before falling by a 
score of 5-8. 

Dan Albrecht and Mike 
Ro~e tl also turned in an 
excellent effort , hut due 10 
the depth of the Santa 
Cruz doubles, their effort 
wasn't quite enough as 
they too fell, 5-8. 

Shabel managed some 
revenge for his regular-season loss 
to Cummings as he went on to 
defeat hi s opponent, 6-2, 7-5, at 
No. I singles. The score does not 
do Shabers performance justice, as 
he dominated Cumming in every 
facet of the game except for serv-
mg. 

Mihet lost a tough match, 3-6, 
2-6 to Oechel, the Western 
Region's singles champion. 

Melicharek, who along with 
Mihet played his final match for 
UCSD on Saturday, was beaten 
soundly at No. 3 singles, 2-6, 2-6. 

Liu got off to a rough start and 
lost the first set at No. 4 singles, 1-
6. Liu turned it around in the sec-
ond and was leading late in the set 
before falling, 4-6. • 

Rosett, who was a late season 
addition to Head .Coach Brian 
Turner's six-man squad, was 
unable to pull off an upset at No. 5 
singles and lost by a score of 3-6, 

Monika Kobylecka/ Guardian 
One swlngln' fellow: Triton right-hander Mike Rosett (center) returns a serve in doubles action. 
Rosett and the rest of the team ran into a buzzsaw in UC Santa Cruz and lost, 1-6. 

2-6. 
Freshman sensation Albrecht, 

who is sure to be an integral pan of 
the UCSD tennis team for years to 
come, played hi s opponent tight the 
entire match but eventually fell in 
two tough sets, 4-6, 6-7. 

The Triton's up-and-down sea-
son has come to a close with an 
overall record of 8-9 against many 
of the toughest Division III schools 

in the country. 
"This season had some tough 

losses in the middle and then we 
came through in the end with a big 
win against Point Loma," Turner 
said about hi s team's performance 
thi s year. "We were pretty inexperi-
enced but we didn't fall apart under 
pressure." 

Mihet and Shabel leave next 
weekend for Nationals on the cam-

First-Round Departure 
POSTSEASON: Head Coach Liz LaPlante's crew traveled to VIrginia for a 
NCAA first-round battle with Amherst College and lost in a tough match 
By Sean RahIm! 
Senior Staff Writer 

There's two theories in Divi-
sion III women's tennis. One 
camp adheres to the 
"fluke" (heory. 
These philosophers 
believe that a splen-
did regular season 
does not necessarily 
equate to a success-
ful post-season per-
formance. 

Everything is up 
for grabs in the playoffs and any 
team can beat you on any given 
day. 

The "intimidation" camp coun-
ters that argument with two 
points. First , a great regular sea-
son gives the squad confidence 
going into the playoffs. 

Second, a great record scares 
the opposing squad into submis-
sion - allowing the team with the 
impressive record to breeze 
through the pos(season. So how 
would the Amherst College Jeffs 
(16- 1) fare in the playoffs? 

Well , after their first-round 
thumping of UCSD and a subse-
quent win over Emory University, 

the "intimidation" theorists have 
something to brag about. 

Their record in 1998 was no 
fluke, as they pounded the Tritons, 

9-0 last Tuesday 
morning on the 
campus of Wash-
ington and Lee Uni-
versity in Virginia. 
Amherst rolled over 
UCSD in what can 
only be described as 
pure domination. 

The young and 
inexperienced Triton squad was 
overwhelmed in the doubles por· 
tion of the day. 

The No. I duo of Pam Dia-
mond and Neely Steinberg defeat-
ed the No. I team of Maria 
Nguyen and"Kirsten Olsen, 8-0. 

Janie Cohen and Carolyn Pas-
tel - playing in the No.2 spot for 
the Jeffs - notched an 8- I victo-
ry over Becky Jones and Robyn 
Kondrack. 

UCSD's Jennifer Drimmer and 
Kelli Tsai put up the best competi-
tion at the No. 3 spot. Sally Childs 
and Sam Toerge were truly tested 
in (hi s duel, but they eventually 
won the battle - grabbing the pro 

(/ I""'; 11111. 11/\, III. III {II IIII 1/\ '(II I,ll," \11/1/, "" 

set, 8-6. 
Down 3-0 going into the sin-

gles portion, things didn ' t get any 
better for Liz LaPlante's young 
team. The 1998 squad spons no 
seniors and only two juniors. This 
year has been a learning year for 
the young squad and thi s trip will 
undoubtedly add to the learning 
process. 

Cohen had some trouble in the 
first set against Olsen - UCSD 's 
phenomenal freshman - but 
eventually prevailed, 6-3, 6-0. 
Diamond battled Nguyen at the 
No. 2 spot - earning a 7-5, 6-1 
win. 

Steinberg continued the 
Amherst domination at the No.3 
slot, defeating Tsai , 6-2, 6-0. 
Jones fared the best among the 
Triton players - winning a set 
but losing the match, 4-6, 6-2, 3-6. 
Childs defeated Kondrack, 6-1 
and 6-1, while Pastel earned a 6-2, 
6-1 victory over Jennifer Drim-
mer. 

The future looks bright for the 
Tritons though. Everyone will 
return next season and UCSD 
should sport a much more experi-
enced team in 1999. 

OBSESSION: 
The Lakers are 
going to win the title 
Continued from Pace 28 
loved watching Arvydas Sabonis 
literally cry, while the rest of the 
frustrated Jail -Blazers contemplat-
ed how to spell "contemplated," or 
"robbery" perhaps. 

Anyway, we (yes, I say "we" 
because I am a part of the extended 
family of the Los Angeles Lakers) 
didn't have the easiest time with 
Portland, but we were never really 
th reatened. 

But then came the big Seattle 
series. Most of the experts had the 
Lakers losing in five, maybe six if 
L.A. played really well at home. 

Then came the first -game di sas-
ter. Seattle played tough. The 
Supersonics looked, well , super. 

After the loss, Mighty 690 (our 
local AM sJX1rts radio station for 
the stupid people) had people all 
day calling for Del Hanris' scalp 
and questioning the non-acquisi-
tion of Mitch Richmond. 

In the interviews prior to game 
two, though, the Lake Sho,w 
seemed loose. Shaq was running 
his mouth, ailing Sonic coach 
George Karl a woman. And Del 
had this weird, laid-back confi-
dence about him. 

He must have known something 
we didn ' t, as his team absolutely 
destroyed Seattle, in Seattle, in the 
second game. Jones had a career-
high and the Lakers played unbe-
li evable defense. 

With the momentum clearly on 
the Los Angeles plane, the teams 
went back to the Southland. The 
Lukers were still loose. They final -

SPORTS 27 

Iy seemed like they were having 
fun . The pressure of winning had 
somehow been lifted. They were 
just playing ball and felt like no 
one - not even their greatest' rivals 
- could beat them. 

Game three personified that as 
the boys came out and scored over 
120 points on one of the best teams 
in the NBA. And continuing with a 
very nice (rend, Jones set another 
career-high. 

Going into game four, it was 
easy to tell that the Sonies were on 
the ropes. Make no mistake, this is 
a mentally tough team. It has faced 
elimination before, so it knew what 
had to be done in the founh game. 

But all of that mental toughness 
doesn't mean much when Nick Van 
Exel is hitting from the outside. 
Robert Horry is playing outstand-
ing defense and, oh yeah, Jones had 
yet another career-high. The Lakers 
posted another easy victory. 

To be honest, the Lakers are the 
best team in the playoffs right now. 
Chicago will be there when it 
counts, but New Jersey and Char-
lotte have exposed some chinks in 
the Bulls' armor. Whoever comes 
out of the Utah-San Antonio series 
will give the Lakers a stiff test, but , 
neither team has the guns to com-
pete with a Laker team that is firing 
on all cylinders. 

The only question right now is, 
can L.A. keep it up? The scary 
thing is, I den 't think they've com-
pletely hit their stride yet. I believe 
this team will continue to win . 

I believe that the Lakers will 
beat Chicago in six. 

I believe that I am the luckiest 
guy in the world. No woman could 
ever treat me as well as my beloved 
sports.

The UCSD Guardian Monday, May II, 1998 

Travis Hili THE MEET: In the biggest meet of the season, the Triton men and women each finished in third place 
Believe it or Don't, 
Coach is in Love 

Hello all , how are you? 
I am feeling very romantic. 

Yes, I know - that romance 
crap doesn't belong on the 
sports page. Believe me, I know 
the rules - I made them. 

But I just can't hold back. 
Just when 1 thought my love-
affair with the sporting world 
was at its peak, we continue to 
grow and share new things with 
each other. 

Like hockey. 
Honestly, I was never a big 

believer in the sport . It was OK, 
but it just didn ' t peak my inter-
est enough. I always passed off 
hockey as some weird Canadian 
thing I'd never understand. Like 
curling, or Labatt 's Blue heer. 

But early in the first round of 
the NHL playoffs thi s year, I 
was feeling very rat and was 
absolutely not going to get off 
the couch to get that damn 
remote. I mean, I could see it on 
the counter, but that was so very 
far away. So I resigned myse lf 
to watch the Philadelphia Flyers 
and the Buffalo Sabres balllc il 
out. 

Needless to say, I was a 
changed potato. 

I loved the hip checks, the 
slappers, the wristers, the occa-
sional bloodbath, the whole 
thing. It is great. You just 
haven't lived until you ' ve seen 
overtime in playoff hockey. It is 
easily one of the most intense 
phenomenons in all of sports. 

This is beautiful. There is a 
new perk in our relationship. 
Now, every day during the week 
there are at least two hockey 
games coupled with my usual 
slate of a few NBA playoff 
games and a baseball game or 
two. I have been to sports heav-
en! 

The only problem is that 
sometimes I feel like I'm cheat-
ing. Like when the Ottawa Sen-
ators are looking for yet another 
upset win, my Padres feel a lit-
tle left out. I mean, we already 
have two TVs in the house, but 
when there are six different 
games on, there is only so much 
you can do, short of going to a 
spoilS bar. 

But that would require mov-
ing, and again, that is a no-no. 

There is one team I will 
never cheat on, though - my 
beloved Los Angel Lakers. 
The Lake Show. Showtime, if 
you will. 

The boys are dominating. 
There is no answer for Shaq, or 
Eddie Jones or even Corie 
Blount. You know things are 
looking good when the big man 
snatches a board, pu hes it up 
the floor and goes coast-to-coast 
with a pretty layup. 

The first round was great . I

For the team, there was no big-
ger meet all season than thi s one. 
This was the time of year when 
everyone puts thei r personal goals 
aside and gives every ounce of 
energy for the sake of earning 
every precious point for the team. 
If the UCSD track and fi eld team 
was going to win the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 

onference Championship held at 
Cal State Los Angeles this week-
end, it was going to need to fi ght 

and earn every point it could . 
Although the conference cham-

pionship went to Cal Poly Pomona 
on both the men's and women's 
sides, the weekend was filled with 
exci tement and drama as it went 
down to the linaltwo events of the 
competition before a winner 
emerged. The Tritons finished a 
close third behind Pomona and 
CSULA in both the men's and 
women 's competition. 

" It was a very exciting week-
end," Assistant Coach Mick 
Gieskes said. "Everyone stepped

up and ran well across the board." 
Heading into the meet, the Tri -

tons knew that they needed strong 
performances, especially since di s-
tance runner Gavin Klinger and 
thrower Matt Seefeld were unable 
to compete due to injuries. 

Heather Winberry, who placed 
second in the high jump with a 
height of 5' 1/4", performed well 
for the women's team. Linda Bar-
tee placed fourth in the same event, 
giving the team some crucial 
points. 

Perhaps the most dominating 
performance by the women's team 
was turned in by 3,OOO-meter run-
ners Meghan Scott , Kri sti 
O'Grady and Meli ssa 
Duscha. The trio swept 
th rough the event wi th 
first-, second- and third-
place fini shes, respecti ve-
ly. Scott, who lead the trio, 
fini shed wi th a personal-
best time of 10:29.98. 

Senior ounney Gray, 
who look victc, ri es in the 800-meter 
and 1,500-meler races, and fresh -
man Lisa Klinger, who set a per-
sonal record in the 5,000-meter on 
her way to winning the event , both 
gave great performances for the 
women's team. Anne Moore al so 
had a tremendous meet with a per-
sonal best in the IOO-meter and a 
third-place finish in the triple jump. 

In the men's competition, Mike 
Wallace provided the team with 
some key points with a first-place 
fini sh in the 1,500s. Mall Amero 
also took a first in the 800 race. 
Additionally, Juan Magdaroag, 
Kirk Miller, Mall Amero and Tim 
Prudence earned the team second-
place points with their run in the 
4x4DO rclay. The 4x I DO relay team 
set a school record of 42:40 in fin -
ishing third .

Two Tritons Honored 
AWARDS: Tyler Field and Gordon Beh, following two stellar 
seasons, each recently received national recognition 
By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The 1997-98 year has been one of marked 
improvement for UCSD's sports teams. 
Women's soccer has again claim'ed the 
National Championship, women's volleyball 
ended a year of unprecedented feats with a 
National Championship and the rugby team 
won its first-ever National Championship. 
Most every other sports team has improved 
upon last years' records. 

Amidst all these team add, ,'111, nt\, a 
number of UCSD athlete» Ihlh" 'll' 1I ... ·led 
themselves as true superstal l>. hI Illy Iwo 
Tritons, freshman Tyler Field and sophomore 
Gordon Beh, were honored with awards rec-
ognizing their personal accomplishments. 

Player of the Year by Columbus Multimedia. 
Already a member of the All-West Region 
Team by the same publication , Field was a 
star for the Tritons. Field fini shed a shortened 
season averaging 22.9 points and a school 
record 12.6 rebounds while shooting 61.4 
percent from the noor. 

Beh, from Kailua, Hawaii , was named by 
the College Sports Information Directors of 
America to the Third Team of the GTE Acad-
emic All -American FallIWinter At-Large 
Team in the College Division. This ranking 
considers mo t fall and winter sports except 
for women's volleyball and both men's and 
women's basketball, and includes all levels of 
collegiate competition but NCAA Division I. 

dies, followed by Kurt Miller, who 
took second in the same event. 

Not to be overlooked were the 
events in which the Tritons did not 
necessarily win, but came away 
with some points for the team. 
Such was the case for the men 's 
fi eld team. In the absence of Matt 
Seefeld, the team was able to get a 
strong performance from Dave 
Spector, who placed third in the 
pole vault with a height of 14' 5 
1/4". 

Matt Tregidga earned points for 
the team with a third-place fini sh in 
the javelin, followed by Chri s 
Swartz with a fourth-place show-

ing. 
The men's squad also 

benefited from a great per-
formance from distance 
runner Steve Varnell. Var-
nell , a senior, ran a person-
al hest time of 31 :51.37 in 
the 10,ODO-meter race on 
his way to an overall sec-
ond-place fini sh. 

" It was a fu n race for me; 
th roughout the race the lead kert 
changing," Varnell said. "[ think 
overall we were sati sfi ed with our 
performance. If we had Klinger and 
Seefeld, we might have made it 
even closer." 

"Every are came up huge,' 
Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale said. 
"Scoring points, stealing points is 
what I told the team we were trying 
to do. Conference is about the 
team, not about individuals." 

Nevertheless, the Triton team 
really came together this weekend 
and it made for some exciting track 
and field competition. 

Nex t up for some of the team is 
a return to CSU Los Angeles to 
compete in the Last Chance Meet, 
where the Tritons will have one 
more opportunity to improve their 
times in hopes of qualifying for 
Nationals. Nationals will take place 
the following week. 

Field, academically a sophomore but in 
his first season of intercollegiate basketball, 
was named the NCAA Division UI Freshman 

Beh is a biochemistry major who has a 4.0 
GPA. During last season on the water polo 
team, Beh totaled 17 goals, 33 steal and 
dealt 6 assists_
