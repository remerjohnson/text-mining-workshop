Provost Search IsOn 
Revelle College All Tapped Out 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Editor 

The search for a new Revelle 
College Provost is on. 

The Search' Committee , 
formed in Nov. as an advisory 
group to Vice-chancellor of 
A cad e m i c -A ff air sPa u I 
Saltman, is currently re-
viewing more than 75 
applications for the Revelle 
Provost post. 

June Tapp, who was provost 
at Revelle for two years, left at 
the end of the last school year 
for personal reasons. 

The select committee 
consists of three Revelle 
faculty members : Jean 

Mandler, Alfred Manaster and 
Harry Suhl; Revelle Business 
Manager Stanley Schutt, 
Third College Provost Joseph 
Watson and two Revelle 
students: Ross Beveridge and 
Mary Anne Rodgers. 

The position has been -
nationally advertised and the 
deadline for applications is 
Jan. 15. 

The committee is taking 
three factors into considera-
tion : 1) To be qualified, a ' 
candidate mvst have cre-
dentials in a department that is 
offered at UCSD, and must 
have a strong record of 
scholarship in that area; 2) 

applicants who have extensive 
academic experience, rather 
than a career primarily in 
business , industry, the military 
or the government are 
preferred; and 3) applicants 
who have come from a major 
research univer ity are 
preferred. 

" We don 't want to exclude 
someone who hasn't had formal 
(provost or dean) training, .. 
according to committee 
member Rodgers. 

The student committee 
members are " looking for 
someone who will interact with 
the students," said Rodgers.

By Kathy Huffer 
taU Writer 

UCSD tudent may oon be 
faced with a temporary 
suspen ion of campu bu 
ervice if a threatened bu 

st rike takes place. 
The San Diego Tran it Corp. 

(SDTC). which provide four 
bus line in the campus area, 
faces the pos ibility of a trike 
by its union member . nion 
worker are unhappy with a 
propo ed contract which would 
reduce their alaries. 

The tran it company' latest 
contract expired on Jan. 1. But 
a recent court order prolonged 
the contract indefi nitely and 
required the company to enter 
into arbitration. Union worker 
have threatened to trike if they 
do not find the resultant 
contract acceptable. 

Kevin Eckery, A st. Tran it 
Coordinator of CSD' Parking 
Services, said that the 
implication of a pos ible bu 
strike " have started a lready ." 

Student bu pa es , which 
are offered on a monthly ba is 
through the Ca hier ' Office. 
are nat avai lable for the month 
of Janua ry , acco rding to 
Eckery. Because the threat of a 
strike is real, he explai ned, " it 
would not be fair (Cor the 
Ca hier' Office) to have to 
refund a ll of the pas e ." 

Eckerye timated that 15% of 
C D tudent u e the public 

transit y tem to get to and 
from school. 

On group of tudent which 
would b hard hit by a bus 
trike i tho e who live at the 

Mesa apartment. Eckery aid 
that many und rgraduate and 
even mor graduate tudent at 
Me a rely upon the transit 
y tem to get to campu . 

" They would find other form 
of tran portation," Eckery said 
in reference to tudent who 
depend upon bu ervice. 
"There would be a light ri e in 
bicycle and motor vehicle use." 
He added that some tudents 
" may be forced to hitchhike." 

Eckery stressed that any 
problem re ulting from a 
trike would only be tem-

porary . " It won' t be perma-
nent." he aid. " The longest 
(bus) strike in San Diego wa 60 
day ." 

The niversity ha di cus ed 
plan to aid students who would 
be affected by the bu trike, 
according to Eckery . He aid 
that the car pool ystem would 
be put into heavier u e and tbat 
" the ride-matching facility 
might be b efed up." 

Pre-meds, Problems:·A Stressful U'C'SD 
'Achievement Oriented' Students and 
Personal Problems Combine for Tension 

By Teresa Tokar 
Staff Wri&er 

Stress. As college students, 
many of us experience some 
degree of this harassing 
monster during at least part of 
our college careers. 

Many of the causes of stress 
of UCSD students stem from 
the pressures of earning a 
college degree. Dr . Rob 
Mashman, a counseling 
psychologist at the Warren 
College Provost Office, said 
that, "achievement oriented" 
students attend this university. 
" They're driven to excel," he 
said, "particularly ifthey want 
to get to medical school. " 
Mashman described this and 
other "stressers", such as 
parental pressure or a broken 
relationship as insignificant 
a lone. but burdensome when 
added together. 

A Sen of Powerl n 
Dr. Hugh Pates , a psy-

chologist who coun I in the 

Revelle Provost offi ce, 
ascribed a source of stress to "a 
sense of powerlessness" which 
students feel when they find 
themselves faced with " having 
more to do or get than time or 
money allows." Professors ilnd 
TAs are constantly imposing 
deadlines on their students. 
While channeling so much of 
their time. energy, and effort 
into college, students begin to 
question the practical value of a 
college degree and begin to 
wonder if, in fact. there is any 
life after college. 

Pates believes that students 
also generate stress through 
their own expectations. For 
some students, a "B" is not a 
satisfactory grade . Some 
minority students from low-
income families, who may be 
the first members of their 
families to attend college, are 
usually very anxious about 
grades. At the other end of the 

pe<.1.rum, some tudent · from 

wealthy famille , who have 
received a good education, 
become concerned when their 
grade point averages faJ.! after 
entering UCSD. ' 

Financially independent 
students have additional 
sources of worry. Although the 
costs of their basic needs 
continues to rise, they are only 
capable of securing part-time, 
minimum wage employment 
because of their po ition a 
college students. 

Stress from In ide 
Mashman added that, 

.. tress not alway come from 
the outside, but from the 
in ide"; thi involve the 
student' false or infl ated 
expectation of him elf a 
opposed to the reali tic 
a essment of hi abilitie and 
natural intere ts. 

Pate aid,' 'too much tres 
and anxiety i detrimental to 
one' phy iological w ll-being.

Is egal Aids Office Too 
Informa on in two articles 

which appeared in the Friday, 
Novembflr 10, 1978 UCSD 
Guardl8ll have prompted this 
letter about the expensive and 
conflict-of-interest ridden legal 
services office, lavishly funded 
with UCSD student Regis-
tration fees. 

The first article (p.l) stated a 
"100% certain" but adminis-
tratively unconfirmed rumour 
that a $25,000 administrator 
who had resigned as Dean of 
Muir College was to be 
transferred to legal services. 
There was no information that 
the former dean had any legal 
training or appropriate legal 
experience to be qualiried for 
such a position , even if there 
were any demonstrated need 
for its creation. Even assuming 
a real need, and the present job 
market for lawyers, a fully 
qualified attorney and member 
of the California Bar, with some 
years of experience could 
easily be engaged for $25,000 
and' accompanying UC 
employee benefits. 

The second article (p.5) 
involved attempts by 14 UCSD 
students (who pay for legal 
services) to obtain compen-
sation from UC for $4999 worth 
of their possessions stolen from 
their locked dorm rooms during 
the 1975 Christmas break. The 
UCSD student-funded legal 
services attorney, Raphael 
Levens, had started to aid the 
students, but pulled out at the 
behest of then Vice-chancellor 
of Student Affairs , George 
Murphy, due to the inherent 

conflict of interest in UCSD's 
costly student' 'legal services" . 
The lawyer father of one of the 
students had finally taken up 
the case (Brown vs. Regents) 
for the students at his own 

..expense. 
The lavishment of a large 

amount of student fees on this 
conflict-of-interest ridden legal 
services office was already 
apparent in an article in the 
UCSD Triton Times of Monday, 
Oct. 17, 1977, which described 
the legal services staff: a lull-
time attorney, an adminis-
trative assistant, and two 
interns, to handle about 1200 to 
1300 student consultees per 
academic year. With the 

addition of a $25,000 adminis-
trator, this looks like a payroll 
plus ' expenses cost of about 
$75,000 dollars per year, or 
around $60 per student 
consultee! 

Is this justified? Many 
students must work at 
minimum wages to pay the fees 
to cover these expenses, in 
order to have access to a 
University of California 
education. Society in general 
has certainly not seen fit to levy 
a uniform head tax on all 
citizens, rich or poor, in order to 
provide free legal services to 
whoever might want or need 
them! 

And remember, if the 

Unification Church Casts 
By David Osborne 
Pacific News Service 

GLOUCESTER, Mass. 
Two short years after shutting 
out foreign competition with 
the 200-mile limit, the 
American fishing industry is 
alive with tales of a new 
menace. This one, however, is 
an intruder of a different 
strU>e: Rev. SlIn MyungMoon's 
controversial Unification 
Church. 

From the day Rev. Moon 's

advertising agent announced in 
the summer of 1976 that Moon 
would "make fish a staple" in 
this country, the church has 
poured millions into the 
business. 

(David Osborne is an associate 
editor of PNS based in New 
York.) 

Under the corporate aegis of 
International Oceanic Enter-
prises, the church now has 

operations on virtually every 
American coast: processing 
plants in Virginia, California 
and soon Alaska, tuna fishing 
and lobster dealing in ' 
Massachusetts, a nd boat -
building in Alabama. 

"Rev. Moon is just very 
interested in the ocean," says 
Aidan Barry, head of the 
church in New England. " He 
feels it's the last frontier on this 
earth and one which is

Expensive? 
students' legal problems 
involve the University, as well 
they might, they can expect no 
help at all, as with the Brown 
case, or even worse, as in the 
case of the students whose 
enrollments were cancelled 
when they asserted a consti-
tutional right not to have to 
share in paying for hundreds of 
abortions each year, (Erzinger 
VS . Regents) they find that 
" their attorney" in legal 
services has even researched 
and advised the administration 
against them! This is of course 
the role of the UC Adminis-
trators' and Regents' " legal 
services": The Office of the 
General Counsel, which has 20 

full-time attorneys assigned to 
various campuses and 
functions, plus staff and an 
annual budget in the neiJhbor-
hood of a million dollars! 

How are legal services 
handled on other campuses 
which are not so lavish in 
collecting or spending ever-
rising student fees? At San 
Diego State University, legal 
services free from conflict-of-
interest are available to 
students either from volunteer 
lawyers through the HELP 
Center, or by services provided 
by a contract between the 
Associated Students and the 
Legal Clinic at University of 
San Diego Law School. This 
prov ides students with 
ine x pens ive , con flict -of-
interest free legal assistance 
'as well as providing law 
students, who would be 
expected to be sympathetic 
with students' legal problems 
themselves, with valuable, 
supervised legal experience) . 
A similar contract exists for 
Grossmont College. and 
members of the San Diego Bar 
Association provide free 
volunteer legal assistance at 
other colleges. The regis-
tration fee committee or 
associated students at UCSD 
could no doubt make similar 
arrangements and save a large 
sum of student fee monies. 

The UCSD legal services 
expense and conflict-of-interest 
was bad enough, but the "100% 
certain" rumour that yet

earth back into its orbil. " 

According to Bob Sullivan, 
assistant to the president of the 
U.S. church. " We're trying to 
encompass every aspect of the 
fishing industry. Our major 
need is to support the mission 
work of the church." 

The move into fishing comes 
at a time of rising criticism of 
the church's streetcorner fund-
raising operations, which bring 
in millions of dollars every year 
through the sale of nowers, 
candy and other items. 

But the Moonies ' arrival in 
fishing communities has been 
greeted with open hostility. 
They have unanimously been 
declared unwelcome declared 
unwelcome by the Bayoo La 
Batre, Alabama, city council; 
they have been warned publicly 
by the mayor of Gloucester, 
Massachusetts. that they would 
have "strap marks on your ass 
before you get a permit out of 
ine:" and they have been the 
subject of an industry-wide 
alert sent out by a rival fish 
dealer in Norfolk, Virginia . 

Inevitably, local residents 
get wind of the accusations 
made by ex-Moonies and 
parents against the church: 
that it lures recruits in under 
false pretenses. subtly 
brainwashes them, then sends 
them out on the streets for long 
hours and little pay to build 
Rev . Moon's fortune and 
political clout. 

But the real uproar starts 
when local businessmen find 
themselves in competition with 
the Moonies , who use church 
members for most of their 
labor and have access tQ ready 

• ' , J J ' 

cash from the church's various 
corporate branches. 

" Every dealer in the city is 
afraid of them," explains one 
Gloucester lobster dealer . 
" They' ve got personnel you 
can't match, they ' ve got money 
you can't match, they don't pay 
taxes like you. There's just no 
way you can compete with 
them:" 

Such warnings first spread 
through the industry after an 
International Oceanic Enter-
prises subsidiary , Interna-
tional Seafoods, bought an 8~ 
man fish processing plant in 
Norfolk. Virginia several years 
ago. 

Local dealers found them-
selves losing both fish and 
retail markets to the new-
comers, who were able to 
squeeze them from both ends, 
paying local boats more than 
they could aCCord and reselling 
the fish for less. 

Last spring and summer, the 
church made a splash in 
Gloucester - the heart of the 
New England fishing industry. 
Rev. Moon and his followers 
had been fishing out of 
Gloucester for several years. 
And Mayor Leo Alper had 
already made clear his wish 
that they "stay the hell out of 
Gloucester." 

When International Seafoods 
bought several acres of 
residential waterfront property 
last spring. Alper immediately 
banned mooring of boats in the 
adjacent cove and closed the 
only roild into the property, 
threatening to condemn it 
permanently .

Shah Gives Up 
Royal Fortune 

TEHRAN, Iran (AP)-
Shah Mohammad Reza 
Pahlavi yesterday turned 
over the Iranian royal 
family's multi-million 
dollar personal property to 
a crown-sponsored foun-
dation in an apparent bid to 
remove the taint of 
corruption from the 
dynasty. He also ordered 
the release of266 prisoners. 

The United States, in a 
policy s hitt, was reported 
in Washington to have 
informed the shah that 
only his temporary depar-
ture abroad would quell 

the violent protests haking 
the country. 

American officials, who 
asked not to be identified, 
said the U.S. view changed 
after it became apparent 
that the installation of a 
civilian government was 
not significantly easing the 
conflict. 

Tehran, blan keted by the 
first snow of the season, 
experienced one of its 
calmest days in months, but 
at least six persons , 
including an army officer, 
were killed in anti-shah 
violence in the provinces. 

Court OKs 'Viable 
Fetus' Abortions 

WASHINGTON (AP)- The 
Supreme Court struck 
down a Pennsylvania 
abortion law yesterday, 
saying it unfairly limited 

. the " broad discretion" that 
doctors need in deciding 
whether to try to save the 
life of a fetus . 

The law had required 
every physician to try to 
preserve the life of a fetus 
" if there is sufficient 
reason to believe that the 
fetus may be viable." 

But by a 6-3 vote, the 
justice ruled that the law 
was too vague because it 
exposed doctors to possible 
criminal charges for not 
trying to save the life of a 
fetus that "may be viable." 

"The present statute does 
not afford broad discretion 
to the physician. Instead, it 
conditiolls potential crim-
inal liability on confusing 
and ambiguous criteria," 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
wrote for the court. 

Tijuana 
Brass? 

TIJUANA, Mexico (AP)-
Four Tijuana police of-
ficers have been jailed on 
extortion charges after an 
Americjln tou rist com-
plained that he was 
kidnapped by police and 
forced to pay $2000 or be 
jailed. 

Medina said his car broke 
down Dec. 11 while he was 
driving his family to the 
interior of Mexico for a 
vaca lion. While trying to 
fix it, he said he was 
arrested and was told he 
was being ta ken to jail. 

But instead, Medina 
claimed, he was ta ken to a 
house in Tijuana and told to 
hand over his money. He 
said he was ta ken then to a 
hotel w here he had left his 
wife and family and was 
told to give the money to 
t he police or e Ille the cQ\lple 
would be jailed. 

" It therefore presents 
serious problems of 
notice , discriminatory 
application and chilling 
effect on the exercise of 
constitutional rights," he 
said. 

New GOy't 
Allows 
Return to 
Homes 

BANGKOK, Thallaud (AP)-
Cambodia's new Communist 
government reported yester-
day that thousands 'Of people 
were flocking back to their 
native villages north of Phnom 
Penh following the overthrow 
of the Communist regime 
which forced them into 
communal farms. 

Western analysts in neigh-
boring Thailand said there was 
still fighting in northwest 
Cambodia and Vietnamese air 
strikes had doubled to almost 
100 a day in mopping up 
operations in the east and west. 
The war spilled into Thailand 
briefly when an unidentified jet 
bombed a border area. 

The air strike in Thailand 
was seen by newsmen at the 
Thai border town of Ta Phraya 
220 miles east of Bangkok. 
Reporters said a jet swooped 
down and dropped three bombs ' 
into a field between two Thai 
military Installations. There 
were no injuries. 

Analysts in Bangkok said 
Cambodian leader Pol Pot and 
his associates who fled . from 
Phnom Penh before it fell were 
trying to set up a line of 
resistance near Siem Reap and 
Angkor, the ancient Cambod-
ian capital, in the northwestern 
part of the country. 

They later added some 
reports indicating that Pol Pot 
may have been killed and 
former Deputy Premier Ieng 
Sary may have fled the 
country.

Five & Ten Opening Delayed 
By Monet Payton 

The Five and Dime reno. 
vation is taking longer than 
expected, delaying the opening 
of the store until next Monday. 
"The Five & Dime has been 
under constant criticism for 
several years because it was 
unable to meet the demands of 
the Muir community - mostly 

because of the design," said 
Brian Klippel , Food Services 
Director. 

Problems such as the 
contractor having trouble 
getting building materials have 
plagued the redesigning . In 
addition, the designer did not 
take all the structural aspects 
into consideration, so there had 

to be some changes in the 
design to uccommodule these. 

According to Muir Hous 
Advi or Kim Haff. the Five & 
Dime will include new 
carpeting and fixtures , in 
addition to a dcli case, booths 
(instead of the former tables) , 
and a totally new menu.

Stress Ridden Sometimes Use Drugs 
(Continue d from pale 1) 
Stress is a very important 
component in the develop-
ment oC a card iovascular 
disease, headaches, and peptic 
ulcers." According to Mash-
man, people have difCerent 
"stress areas". Located in 
various parts of the body (e.g .• 
the neck, t he arm. the 
stomach), the muscle in that 
area becomes tense and begins 
to ache whenever that person 
undergoes a great amount of 
stress. He added that when one 
refuses to acknowledge stress, 
that stress can turn itself into 
physical symptoms, such as 
ulcers. 

An excess amount of stre s· 
can also hamper academic 
performance. One who feels 
that he must get an "A" in a 
certain class is less likely to 
succeed in achieving his goals 
than the person who attempts 
his goals with the attitude 'of 
"I'll try my best." Pates said, 
" that which he or she desires 
the most often alludes the 
student;.. thus. the student 
becomes overly anx iolJS. 

An excess of stress can cause 
the " freezing with lear" 

reaction, in which students are 
unable to accurately solve an 
equation or write down the 
correct answer because oftheir 
high anxiety level. Pates 
described this as, "a lapse. of 
ability to concentrate. Things 
become so muddled that there 
is no clarity of thinking." 

In addition, too much stress 
can produce a low level 
anxiety. Mashman said, "they 
feel kind of worried, bu~ they 
don ' t know what they ' re 
worried about." 

Dr ugs to Relax 
According to Pates , alcohol 

and pot are sometimes used by 
students in an attempt to relax, 
especially to get a good night's 
sleep the night before an exam. 
Pot and alcohol can a lso give 
students a feeling oC living life 
more comfortably, and are 
sometimes used after an 
academic failure to initiate 
relief. Some students also use 
these drugs to help them relax 
in social situations. 

Despite all the calamities 
which stress seems to be 
related to, Pates believes that 
suicide here is u ually not 
caused by st ress, a the suicide 

rate here is low compared to the 
suicide rates of other groups of 
young adults. He feels that this 
is because students here are 
"goa l oriented". They have 
something to live for, an inner 
motivation, a drive which 
keeps them going. However, a 
great deal of stress can cause 
one to have a total breakdown, 
which may end in suicide. 

Ways to Cope , 
There are ways for one to 

cope with stress . Th e 
suggestions below are the 
combined suggestions of Pates 
and Mashman. 

(1) Concentrate on the 
present moment. Exercise 
your power and control over the 
immediate time. For instance, 
if someone only has two days to 
read two long sociology books. 
more likcly than not that person 
will spend his timE: worrying 
about how he will ever 
complete both books by the two-
day deadline , instead of 
actua lly reading the books; 
therefore, he would pend all of 
his time worrying, but gelling 
nothing accomplished . By 
concentrating on the present 
moment, one would reason: " r 

Outback Cafe Struggles to Survive 
By Vidya Tolani 

The Outback CaCe. whiclt 
came into existence in 1977 as a 
refuge for Warren students. has 
not been doing as well as its 
counterparts at Revelle and 
Muir. 

The Cafe was to be open 
Monday through Thursday 
nights from eight to midnight, 
but only managed to do that for 
one week last quarter. Those 
who volunteered their time to

"There w ill be an open 
session held within the next 
couple weeks to get student 
input - this is a chance for

The committee has tentative

run the place during that week 
found out that the Outback had 
virtually no customers, and, as 
a result, it was forced to close 
down. 

David Lynch, who keeps the 
books fOr the Cafe, has been 
trying hard to revive-and fix up 
the place. He succeeded in 
a dding a new pool table to the 
Outback ' s scanty furniture. 
but does not have the student 
support that he needs. 

Lynch hopes to get the 
Outback a seat on the Student 
Cabinet and wants to get 
commuter students involved. 

He has been trying to get 
students to perform anything 
from guitar playing to reciting 
poetry and sent flyers around 
the Warren dorms requesting 
volunteers, but no one has come 
forward yet. 

" r know there is ta lent in the 
dorms," he said. He added that 
he felt tha t there is still hope for 
the Cafe with the help of 
motivated personnel. 

Until then. the Outback Cafe 
sits empty in a secluded spot 
behind Behring Hall on Warren 
campus.

therefore making the most use 
of my time to study." 

(2) Share the burden . 
"Students who study together, 
study better," said Pates . " It's 
a whole process of mutual 
learning." Pates believes that 
when a student studies with his 
classma tes , he learns that they 

are about as anxious and 
unsure about the subject 
matter as he. This creates a 
sense of relief within the 
student, which leads to better 
study. He also feels that time is 
used more productively during 
group study , as less time is 
spent worrying and day-
dreaming.

their inter-league rival FOLKS 'N 
STROKES 19-16 in an exciting, down-
to-the-wire finish . 

All meetings will be held in the Conference Room in the Recreation Gym. 

Coed Volleyball 
It was strictly Hollywood stuff all 

the way in the AAA Championship 
finals as the unrated and largely 
ign-ored NANSEN'S MESSENGERS 
capped a truly unbelievable play-off 
series by knocking off top-seeded 
HOLOCAUST 15-17, 16-14, 15-11. The 
MESSENGERS who finished a lowly 
fourth place in their league season 
with a mediocre 11-10 record swept 
past three of the top four-rated teams 
in their run to the title. 

The favored WALLBANGERS 
annexed the AA crown by trouncing 
interleague rival LINOMANIA 15-8, 
15-5. A rare oddity in 1M sports (ound

capped a perfect 9-0 season by 
drowning the REAR ADMIRALS 15-7 
in the AA Championship game. 

In Single-A action, the melodiously-
named WHITE PUNKS ON TUBES 
walked off with their first H20 
Water Polo champions hip by 
outquacking the RUBBER DUCKIES 
13-9.

Coach HOp-'ful 
First Place for Ruggers? 

By Jon Goe&z 
Senior Saall Writer 

Saying his men's and 
women's rugby teams are the 
best to compete ror the school in 
years, coach Dave Phillipson 
predicts top seasons for both 
squads this season. 

Phillipson, a native of rugby-
loving New Zealand , cites the 

teams' play against older, 
more experienced club teams. 
this winter, their superior 
speed, and the camaraderie 
among players as reasons for 
their potential success. 

The women, who knocked off 
a top club team in tournament 
play last weekend, "could pull 
'off some big upsets, " according 

to their coach . He picks them to 
beat UCLA and San Diego Sta te 
"quite easily ," but they may 
find thei r true challenge to be 
the University championship 
series. 

Led by Courth year player 
Francine Brown, the ro ter 
includes a number of top 
players in Chris Haubrich . Beth 
Kams, Julie Lineberger , 
Connie Parker, and fir t year 
player Alii Towle. 

The girls will travel to Santa 
Barbara a nd Arizona for 
games, and pick up additional 
experience against area teams. 

Ironically , Phillipson 's own 
country, the premier nation of 
rugby , has no women player . 
So while he is new to teaching 
women the sport, the women 
have little difficulty picking up 
the fundamentals of the game. 

" They are quick learners," 
said Phillipson . " They do the 
same exercises and training as 
the men do. And they benefit 
from training with the men." 

The men's team, also with 
several wins and losses behind 
them against club teams, will 
play to their speedy backs as 
much as possible. " Both teams 
have exceptionally fast backs,"

Ruggers Hopeful Men's Baseball All people interested in playing on the intercollegiate 
baseball team are asked to 
attend an important meeting 
tonight (Wednesday, January 
10) at 7 pm in the Rec Gym 
Conference Room. 

(Continued from page 7) 
said the Triton coach. 

"We are going to have to keep 
the game at a fast pace, and to 
run the forward pass," he 
continued. 

The team is aiming for a first 
place finish in the College 
Championships, where they 
finished third in 1978. That 
tournament pits UCSD against 
six of twelve smaller colleges in 
the southland in April. 

One aspect of the sport that 

makes UCSD play su~cessfully 
in these games and tourna-
ments is the fellowship between 
the two teams, and within each 
team. 

"In rugby you're playing a 
team game, and you have to 
rely on teammates a lot, " said 
Phillipson. "There is not the 
pressure buildup of a game like 
football, so there is a lot of 
comradeship. The players have 
good relationships with each 
other."

Street Poet Tom Waits: 
A Beatnik, Hybrid Star 

By Barry Alfonso 
Tom Waits picked his teeth 

with a matchbook cover and 
stared at the toe of his worn 
black boot, appearing fatigued 
and pensive at once. Curled up 
in fetal position in a velvet 
upholstered chair, the 
singer/songwriter definitely 
looked out of place in the self-
consciously genteel lobby of 
downtown San Diego's 
Westgate Plaza Hotel , where he 
received the press before 
appearing that evening, 
December 10, at the Roxy 
Theater in Pacific Beach. 
Waits ignored his surroundings 
as best he could. 

"Musically, I'm a combina-
tion of Moms Mabley and Rod 
SE?rling," he explained with as 
straight a face as he could 
muster. Tagged by the rock 
press as the Beatnik Poet of 70s 
music, Waits obviously wanted 
to have fun playing with media 
preconceptions. But while the 
influence of Jack Kerouac and ' 
other 50s writers on his work is 
hard to miss , I've never 
considered Waits merely an 
imitator of a dead literary 
school : The man is capable of 
writing funny, moving songs, 
told from the viewpoint of the 
dow n trodden st reet poet 
persona Waits has created over 
the years. 

1 found myself. interviewing 
this same gruff but sentimental 
character I'd come to know 
from Waits ' six albums . 
Cynical about the showbiz life 
after almost five years of 
continuous concert touring, he 
still spoke idealistically about 
writing songs. "I try to 
eavesdrop on other people's 
conversations .. .I write about 
things people can identify with. 
I don't do songs about cocaine 
and rich rock stars. There's no 
way n kid can relate to that ort 
of thing." Some years ago 
Waits stopped compos ing in the 
traditional pop/rock format 
and chose to work in a more 
extended jazz poetry mode -
" I went outside of the pop tune, 
r wanted to stretch thing oul. " 
Despite less than OVeI' -
whelming album sales, Waits ' 
music continues to be 
individual and uncompro-
mised. 

Now 29, Waits has spent most 
of his adult life developing his 
distinctive sound. As <l boy in 
San Diego he wa an avid fan of 
P_lfS'~~~Pdbl~~,-;- ~ .. 

: ;fIIIIY.,' , . 'Mult" ' \ioM tI 

James Brown 's " Poppa 'sGotA 
Brand New Bag" . His list of 
creative influences includes 
Ray Charles, Fats Domino 
jazz artists such as Miles Davi~ 
and George Shearing, poet! 
comedian Lord Buckley . 
Working as the doorman at 
Mission Beach's old Heritage 
folk music club led to Waits' 
first stage performance there 
("I did 'Hit The Road Jack' and 
'Are You Lonesome To-
night'?' ") Later he moved to 
Los Angeles, was signed to 
Asylum Records, began 
touring with such artists as 
Frank Zappa , "Frank was on 
the road - I opened the show 
for him," h~ remembers. "I 
was as popular as bone 
cancer." Waits has built his 
career the hard way, slowly 
building up a following rather 
than aaapting his music to the 
tastes of the moment. 

In conversation Waits is 
reserved, still a bit shy even 
after the countless interviews 
he's been through. The stage is 
much more his element. At the 
concert later that night Waits 
was always the center of 
attention, delivering at times 
hilarious, at limes touching 
performance with the skill of an 

expert characte r actor. He 
cakewalked, scat -sang , 
hovered and swa yed around the 
mike stand in a cloud of 
cigarette smoke as he brought 
to life the assorted hookers, 
washed-up playboys and

" Hell , Marysville ain't 
nothing but a wide spot in the 
road/

The song was Waits at his 
finest , dramatic and con-
vincing. He cared about the fate 
of his characters and, for a few 
minutes, so did I. 

After the show it's possible 
Waits flew up to Hollywood COl' 
a big rock star party with lots of 
record execs and groupies in 
attendance. I 'd rather imagine, 
though, Waits heading Cor Little 
Jo' s Pizza downtown or 
Rudford's 24-hour coffee shop

hunched over a cold plate of 
ham and eggs, talking to a

WeeL, JM. 10, 1171 

A oiding Stress: Realism, Humor Key 
(COD , from pale 5) 
and.one veniq away from 
intensive study. He urges 
students to "get involved in 
some 21ctivity which is 
pleasurable for them." He 
described recreational ac-
tivities as "all the better" when 
used for this purpose, and he 
also recommends walking. He 
added, "some of our students 
are involved in dancing and 
find it a very useful activity." 

Mashman also feels that 
students should take study 
breaks. He sa id, "you should do 
something nice on the 
weekends, or go out on the 
weeknights. If people don't 
engage in other activities, they 
become so anxious and 
depressed that they can' t study 
well ." Mashman recommends 
both micro breaks, which are 
short breaks during study 
hours , and macro breaks, 
which are vacations and day-
long activities. He suggested, 

"It's probably better to do some 
kind of physical activity 
relUlarly. That in itself will not 
solve the problem (of stress), 
but it will probably help." 

For students writing a term 
paper, Mashman suggests that 
students first absorb the 
information, and then go out 
somewhere for a while; this 
will allow the material to 
formulate in the back of your 
mind; then go back and write 
the paper. 

(4) Be flexible. If you are 
unsuccessful at something, 
such as a particular major, 
consider your alternatives. 
Mashman said , "there are 
always options. They (orne 
students) believe that they 
have to go to medical school. 
They refuse to see that they 
can't become physicians," but, 
" there are alway alterna-
tives ." He added that 
sometimes people become so 
anxious that they are unable to 

perceive other alternatives. 
(5) Be realistic about your 

interests, abilities, and needs. 
Mashman said, "people have to 
take into account their own 
needs. They have to decide 
what they'd like to do, what 
they need to do. We must accept 
what we can't do. We're all not 
good at everything." 

He added, "people think 
they're machines; (that they 
are able to) do work without 
taking into account their other 
needs (e.g. , eating, sleeping, 
friends, fun activities). People 
think they should be like 
machines, but they can't. Then 
they feel guilty, but I feel that 
people shouldn't feel guilty 
about it. " 

(6) Allow yourself to get 
involved in the non-academic 
areas of the university. By 
working together with other 
students in a cooperative spirit 
to accomplish a goal, said 
Pates, the student is able to 

UCSD .Fees Abused? 
.. 

Adminstrators Gobbl~ng Our Fees 
(Continued from page 2) 
is to be loaded on students' 
backs is outrageous! Yet, it is 
only one small new piece of the 
lavish waste and abuse of 
UCS :f) student fees . A 
California resident must now 
pay fees of $723 for under-
graduates and $765 for 
graduates/academic year, 
assuming waiver of the $6 
CALPIRG fee and no parking 
fee, to have access to a publicly-
funded education at UCSD. 
Even doubling these amounts is 
now being considered. The Los 
Angeles Times of June 10, 1978 
(p.C-l) reported that Chancel-
lor McEI roy said he is 
recommending a minimum 
increase of $500 for fall of 1979. 

No significant part of present 
UCSD fees goes to fund 
academic or' research ex-
penses. At San Diego State 
University, student fees are 
less than one third of those at 
UCSD - only $202/academic 
year for all students. Yet, the 
SDSU students have a wide 
range of services: a large 
" Aztec" student center 
(UCSD's has little space left 
beyond that used to provide 

offices to the various adminis-
trative and student bureauc-
racies), 'a large health center, 
athletics, etc. Yes, and legal 
services, too. 

To add a $25,000 salaried 
administrator, without legal 
qualifications to the student 
affairs legal services at this . 
time is not only outrageous, but 
fundamentally dishonest, when 
the administration is talking of 
large fee increases, and at the 
same time presenting to the 
Governor proposals to meet his 
budget cuts, by even cutting 
that most essential of academic 
services, library hours , in 
order to save paltry sums of 

TH 

money paid to student library 
as istants! 

An administration which 
would add uch outrages as this 
to its lush featherbedding, 
while proposing large student 
fee increases, and cutting even 
library hour , deserves the 
censure of the public and their 
elected representatives, 
displayed iIT the form of fiscal 
stringency; and of students, 
displayed in declining 
enrollments, dissatisfaction, 
high transfer rates (yes, often 
to SDSU) and perhaps even in 
such phenomena as the 
unjustifiable Revelle food fight.

share himself with others, and 
is able to experience a sense of 
accomplishment. 

Pates explained the impor-
tance of having outside 
interests during college by 
describing a frequent occur-
rence here: A student who 
devotes all of his time and 
energy solely towards studying 
throughout most of his college 
career one day realizes that he 
has no social life or true friends. 
This realization causes the 
student to feel a sense of 
meaninglessness towards his 
schoolwork. He is also troubled 
about his lack of social life. The 
combined effect 'of his 
newfound anxiety and sense of 
meaninglessness will often 
cause such a student's grades 
to plunge. 

(7) Have a better sense of 
humor. Dr. Pates feels that it is 
important to see " the humor of 
situations." He described this 
as , "being able to be saved by 
being able to laugh and smile, 
so that life does not seem so 
constantly desparate and 
anxiety producing." 

Counseling Availa ble 
Professional counseling is 

available for students at UCSD. 
UCSD ' !> Counseling & 

Psychological Services 

consists of 10 staff counselors 
and 10 pre-doctorial interns. 
One or two staff members are 
placed on each campus to 
maintain closer contact with 
the student body. The central 
office is located at Building 412, 
Reception room 5, Warren 
Campus. That office is open 
from 8-5, Monday-Friday, and 
its phone number is 452-3755. In 
addition to regular counseling, 
anxiety reduction seminars are 
open to students. These 
seminars are held from the fifth 
through the tenth week of each 
quarter, and trained counselors 
teach relaxation techniques to 
tudents. 
Mashman added, "feelings of 

stress are not commonly 
pathelogical , but very 
natural. "
