OPEN HOUSE - Thousands 
swarmed the campus yesterday for the 
annual Open House. Jazz bands, gospel 
choirs, science displays, social science 
lectures and one failed attempt to raise 
a hot air balloon in Revelle Plaza were 
part of the day, as well as a 
Renaissance Faire held at Revelle 
behind the HL library.

Another AS elections run-off 
Editor: 

The issue is plain and 
simple. TGIFs are the only 
campus social events that 
brillJ students together. One 
presidential candidate, Jules 
Bagneris, would like to turn 
TGIFs into cultural events, 
thus eliminating the beer. 
The other candidate, Josh 
Harris, will continue to 
spon-r TGIFs. 

We would not otherwise 
vote in the elections but this 
issut: is compelling. We 

Editor: 
The Women's Resource 

Center voted to endorse three 
candidates in the AS run·off 
election at its general 
meeti"B last Monday. We are 
endorsmg Jules Bagneris for 
president, Alma Key for vice 
president and Toby Raymond 
for publit relations. We feel 
that these three candidates 
are well-qualified for the 
offices they are seeking, and 
urge you to vote for them 
today. 

Jules BaJlneris has been 
suportive oT women's issues 
on the many committees he 
has served on. Alma Key has 
been active in black Women 
Achievers and has shown 

Editor: 
We wholeheartedly en-

dorse the candidacy of Josh 
Harris for AS president. Josh 
has demonstrated leadership 
qualities while promoting 
TGIF's and other campus 
programmi"B functions. Josh 
has been active and has made 
legitimate contributions to 
the student community. In 
sum, Harris is a man of 
substance, while little can be 
said for his opponent. 

Ha rris also possesses 
realistic goals that are in full 
accord with student needs. 
Once the AS gets its act 
together on campus, then and 
only then can it have an 
efficacious voice regarding 
greater issues. To state it 
simply, there are too many 

Editor: 
I beg to commend the 

sporting article buried on 
page 14 (Guardian, April 27) 
- I just hope it was dug 
deeper than my graduating 
committee shall surely bury 
me if they read it. Three 
cheers to the electric beers 
that never ~t me past second 
base (I can t even hit homers 
in my dreams!) and to the 
losing members of the fourth 
estete. 

1V"e called the game "The 
AS Takes On the Press." It 
wlL'i < great. However, I've 
noticed another game: The 
Press Takes On the AS. It's 
not very fun, the sportsone-
ship is questionable, and it's 
the students who may end up 
losintt. I'm addressing the 
election coverage ' of the 
presidential race. There are 
students who look to the 
GWlrdian for guidance, and 
I'm worried at the unobjec-
tive info being offered . 

I was shocked at the front-
page article (Guardian, April 
20), by Paul Farwell, wherein 
aside from the obvious 
candidate's name and picture 
in the box, an unidentified AS 
member was quoted for 
predictions of the pre iden-
tial outcome. Other "inside 
source " rould have ea ily 

endorse Harris and the 
continuation of social 
interaction that occurs at 
TGIGs. Vote today for Josh 
Harris!

strong leadership abilities in 
student organizations. Toby 
Raymond staffed at the WRC 
Winter quarter and has been 
active on the AS Rules 
Committee and the Muir 
College Council. 

All three candidates have 
had a great deal of experience 
in working on issues of 
concern to students on this 
campus. The WRC strongly 
endorses these three 
candidates based on their 
past performance in student 
government and on their 
sincere commitment to 
serving the needs of UCSD 
students.

the AS to run around 
attemrting to cure all of the 
ills 0 society. A vote for 
Harris will focus the few 
resources the AS controls on 
addressing campus prob-
lems. 

We urge all students to 
vote for Josh Harris. Harris' 
election will make a 
difference. As graduating 
seniors, even we feel that the 
difference between the 
candidates compels a large 
turnout. Vote for Josh Harris.

been quoted with conflicting 
results. These focused points 
can have a definite impact on 
votes, and it seems that they 
may very well have. 

Neither can I believe the 
headline on page five 
(Guardian, April 27) which 
implies the slate name of one 
of the presidential nominees. 
I remember the extra 
coverage given the Silly Slate 
last year and cringe at a 
similar electoral episode this 
year through media influence 
on voters. I realize both 
candidates have now hit the 
front page, but timing and 
focus make the difference. 
Please be more aware of this 
in the future. 

The AS has always been 
important to me - the 
students and its Council- so 
I'm compelled to also say that 
J vigorously support the 
hardworking, industrious 
Alma Key and the re pons-
ible, caring Toby Raymond. 
The politically opportunistic 
and presumptuous Jules 
Bagneris I can definitely do 
without. 

I urge students to vote and 
vote carefully . It's so 
important, and your vote 
make all the difference.

Editor: 
This is by no means the 

type of letter that I am used to 
writill$' I have always felt 
that it IS better to compliment 
someone and be constructive 
than to criticize and tear 
apart. 

I would have been quite 
easy for me to take no role in 
today's run-off election. The 
easy way out WlL'i to let the 
election occur without my 
input. Recent events have 
made that impossible. 

I am not going to bombard 
the Guardian reader wit h 
crescendos and superlatives 
tor Josh Harris and Erik 
Singer. I have found them 
both to be extremely capa ble, 
good-hearted candidates. 
They will both serve you well 
if you choose to elect them. 

Instead, in this letter, I feel 
an obligation to set the record 
stra!sht about presidential 
candIdate Jules Bagneris. I 
feel it is necessary for the 
student body to know some 
facts about a person they 
might elect as the next

Key for the position of vice

Our experience in working 
with Alma on different issues 
and projects has enlightened 
us to' her outstanding 
attributes that qualify her for 
this position. 

Alma has been actively 
involved with student 
government for three years. 
She is an influential member 
of the BSU and Black Women 
Achievers, as well as being an 
advocate of student rights at 
both the college and campus 
level.

extremely advanced ability to

C8l1egeCouncil, has staffed at

familiar with the dissemina· 
tion of information to 
students as he knows the 
media sources. 

Most importantly, stu · 

dent. 
Jules Bagneris is out for 

one person and one person 
only and that's himself. Jules 
has been courting the job of 
president for a year now. 
Every action Jules takes is to 
better align himself to be an 
ASUCSD president. 

Some will point to Jules' 
green ribbon campaign for 
the children of Atlanta as a 
significant contribution . 
While there is no doubt that 
the workers who helped this 
campaign and wore the 
ribbons were sincere and/'ust 
in their cause, those 0 us 
who have politically worked 
with Jules the closest know 
that it was just a mechanism 
to initiate his 1981 
presidential election cam-
paign. . 

Jules has already set his 
eyes on what he will do if he is 
elected. In fact, as he said in 
the Guardian, he is quite 
confident that he will win. I 
have no dou bt that he does 
not realize he has a capable 
candidate opposing him. 

He has already indicated 

work with all types of people. 
This is exemplified through 
her representation on various 
search committees, and the 
many types of programming 
that she has been involved 
with, including CUDA. 

In addition to Alma's 
extensive experience in 
dealing with relevent student 
concerns, there are aspects of 
Alma's personality that make 
her the most qualified 
candidate for this position. 
Alma has a charismatic and 
commanding personality 
that generates the respect of 
everyone she had contact 
with. Alma has the inner 
strength to run the council 
meetings very effectively. 

She also has the organiza-

dents like him because he's 
congenial, responsible and an 
all around great guy. Toby 
Raymond works well with 
people and he'll work well, 
and hard, with you and the 
new Council. Vote Toby 
Raymond for Commissioner 
of Public Relations. He's 
experienced with the AS 
Council, he's qualified for the 
job, and he deserves your 
vote.

that he would fire several 
staff members who work for 
you, the students. Not only 
does he not have the power to 
do this even if elected, it is 
unconscionable for Jules to 
handle workers in this 
manner. 

Power is what] ules thrives 
on. Power is not what the 
office of the president is 
about. Concern for others is 
what being president is 
about. 

In short, when you S"? to 
the polls to vote for PresIdent 
I ask that you keep this in 
mind: has Jules shown you 
that he has a preponderance 
of information on real 
substantative student issues, 
or has he shown you his 
ability to melodiously court 
votes? As a person who has 
worked with Jules for a year, 
I, and others who serve you, 
have found Jules to be an 
unworthy candidate of the 
trust you invest in a 
president.

tiona! skills that will lead to 
shorter meeting times, and 
open the doors to cooperation 
between student organiza-
tions and the AS. It is for 
these reasons that we the 
undersigned, wholeheartedly 
endorse Alma Key for the 
position of vice president and 
chair of the ASUCSD council. 
We would also like to urge 
everyone to get out and vote,

- SPECIAL TRIB UTE 

-Kent State: a fight for restitution 
BY DAVE WHEELER 

David Frost: "What is the 
word for that, Murder?" 

Spiro Agnew: "Yes, but not 
first degree." 
David Frost Program, 

May 7,1970 
Metromedia Television 

Thirteen students were 
shot by National Guardsmen 
on May 4, 1970, at Kent State 
University in Kent, Ohio. 
Four died. Investigations 
were made, grand juries 
convened and lawsuits were 
filed. Eleven years later, not 
one guardsman has served a 
day in jailor paid a cent to the 
loved ones of the slain 
students. This is the story of 
Kent State justice. 

Within an hour of the 
shootings, Potage county 
Prosecutor Ron Kane 
brought an application to his 
80·year old friend Judge 
Albert Caris. Judge Caris 
issued an injuction immedi-
ately closing the university, 
and 21,000 students were 
ordered to evacuate. The 
Kent State administration 
herded thousands of students 
into hastily comandeered 
buses to get them off the 
campus. Federal, state and 
local troops occupied the 
campus and town. 

The night of the shootings, 
Kent and' Ohio State Police 
prepared to raid what they 
described as a radical 
communications center. 
They were tipped off when 
they discovered that dead 
student Jeffrey Miller had the 
phone number of the center 
in his pocket when shot, as 
did several other arrested 
students. On that evidence, a 
search warrant was issued to 
seek "radio broadcasting 
equipment." Police surroun-
ded the apartment and burst 
in with guns drawn. After a 
fruitless search of the 
apartment , the officers 
directed the apartment 
occupants outside into the 
street and arrested them for 
violation of curfew. Prior to 
their trial, the occupants 
were able to prove that the 
arrests had taken place 25 
minutes before the curfew 
began. Charges were 
dropped. The mysterious 
radical communications 
center? Student legal aid. 

After closing the univer-
sity, Prosecutor Kane 
directed state, local and 
campus police in a six·day 
search of every dormitory 
room on campus. Lawyer 
Kane reasoned that no search

warrants were necessary 
because the student housing 
contracts with the university 
were suspended when he 
succeeded in closing the 
campus, and therefore, the 
students no longer had the 
right to possession of their 
rooms. Six days of searching 
by three police agencies had 
produced a shotgun, a .22 
caliber rifle , several BBguns, 
three slingshots, sixty 
knives, several hash pepes, 
six growing marijana plants 
and a yellow button which 
said "Dare to Struggle, Dare 
to Win." Although a campus 
policeman was subsequently 
fired for stealing $30 from a 
room during the search, it 
served its purpose when 
reports of the student arsenal 
rocked the surrounding 
community. A poll taken in 
the surrounding counties 
showed that 75 percent of the 
respondents thought that the 
dead students had gotten 
what they deserved. 

Meanwhile, according to 
US Senator Stephen M. 
Young, over 300 FBI agents 
descended on Kent. Charles 
G. Cusik, FBI special agent, 
told the press that they had 
linked a Kent State 
sophomore to the burnin/{ of 
the campus ROTC buildmg 
two days before the killings. 
Agents invaded the student's 
apartment seeking "clothing, 
explosive materials , devices

utilized in the use of such 
materials and other items 
which could be used for such 
purposes (?)." The student 
was taken to an undisclosed 
location, interrogated for 
hours and shown non· 
incrimiqating pictues of 
himself at a demonstration. 
No charges were filed and he 
was released. 

On July 23, 1970, The 
Akron Ohio Beacon.Journa/ 
reported that the FBI had 
concluded that at least six 
guardsmen could be crimi· 
nally prosecuted for their 
actions at Kent State. 
Thereafter, a summary of the 
FBI investigation was 
released. The FBI found that: 

1. The crowd was apparent· 
ly initially peaceful and 
relatively quiet; 

2 .Some guardsmen, 
including General Canter-
bury and Major Del Corso, 
stated that the Guard did run 
out of tear gas. However, in 
fact, it had not; 

3.Forty-seven guardsmen 
claim they did not fire their 
weapons. There are substan-
tial indications that at least 
two and possibly more 
guardsmen are lying about 
this fact; 

4.The guardsmen were not 
surrounded; 

5.No guardsman claims he 
was hit with rocks immedi· 
atey prior to the shO<?tings; 

6.There was no sntper; 
7. Some guardsmen, 

including some who claimed 
their lives were in danger and 
some who fired their 
weapons, had their backs to 
the students when the firing 
broke out; 

8. We have reason to believe 
that the claim by the 
National Guard that their 
lives were endangered by the 
students was fabricated 
subsequent to the event. 

The grand jury report was 
released in mid-October. As 
many predicted, no guards· 
men were indicted. Instead, 
the grand jury placed the 
blame on the Kent State 
students and administration: 
"The verbal abuse directed at 
guardsmen by the students 
during the period in question 

represented a level of 
obscenity and vulgarity 
which we have never before 
witnessed!...!t is hard to 
accept the fact that the 
language of the gutter has 
become the common vernacu-
lar of many persons posing as 
students in search of higher 
education .. .. Those who acted 
as participants and agitators 
are guilty of deliberate, 
criminal conduct." Tile 
guardsmen who shot the 
unarmed students, however, 
were "not su bject to criminal 
prosecution because they 
fired their weapons in the 
honest and sincere belief that 
they would suffer serious 
bodily injury had they not 
done so." At least for the 
grand jury, it appeared that 
the punishment for obscenity 
and vulgarity was death. 

Although the grand jury 
failed to indict any of the 
guardsmen, 24 students and 
a faculty member were not so 
lucky. The student body 
preSident and two students 
wounded by guard gunfire 
were among the indicted. The 
first criminal trial was that 
of student Jerry Rupe, who 
was char~ with three riot-
related crtmes. Although the 
prosecution refused to plea 
bargain with Rupe, he pled 
guilty to a charge resulting 
from his interference with 
firemen during the burning 
of the campus ROTC 
building two days before the 
shootings . Rupe then 
proceeded to trial on the 
remaining two charges. After 
eight hours of deliberation, 
the jury reported that they 
were hopelessly deadlocked 
in favor of aquitta\. 

A new jury was sworn for 
the second trial, that of Peter 
Bliek. After three prosecu· 
tion witnesses failed to place 
Bliek at the scene of the 
crime, the prosecutor 
announced that he had no 
further witnesses and did not 
wish to prosecute further. 
The charges were dropped. 
The next two defendan ts pled 
guilty to misdemeanor riot 
charges and all other charges 
were dropped. The fourth

AS Presidential candidate Jo hua Harri 
and Jule Bagneris had asia hing, bitter 
debate Friday afternoon, each candidate 
attacking the judgement, experience and 
s incerity of the other, 

Said Harris, about Bagneris' reportedly 
difficult relat ions with the AS staff . "it shows 
poor judgement to put any pressure like tha t 
on those taff peopl , Tho. e people depend on 
their job for their li\'lihood . and there's no 
rea on t draw til m into an election," 

Bagneri had earlier criticized " in-hou e 
fighting" in theA staff, and " ugg ted " that 
they "get on the ball and tartdoingthing for 
·(udents." He al 0 sa id the "re ,pect" hi. 

campaign demanded for th AS in his 
ca mpaign threatened the staff. 

Bagneris took Harri s to ta 'k for hi . stand on 
rape. Harri had :sugge ted that the A 
Bulletill was one method of keeping attention 
on rape problem on campus. 

He also said that he and incumbent AS 
Pre ident Bill Topkis had met with Chancellor 
Atkin n orne week. ago, and that Atkinson 
to ld them that he could not afford to spend 
m ney to combat rape. 

But , Harris reported, the chancellor did 
s ugge t that Joe ' Escort rvice take ca\l 
through the police department , thereby 
defraying the major portions of Joe's budget. 

But Bagneris said that " will not provide 
what is needed ," 

If a person will not provide what is needed , 
or a person is not willing to put pressure on the 
administration when they can ' t afford 
student safety , then there is a problem. We 
can't afford to have someone who is 
ineffective," he added.

The two tried to portray them elves a they 
have throughout the campaign . Harri aid in 
hi opening statement that he i " not running 
on programming alone." He made it clear that 
h e is al so running on his record , "Just a r do 
for programming. I can do for the AS," Heal 0 
s uggested that he ha run a better campaign 
than Ba~ne ri . " If you can't run a campaign, 
you can t run the pr idency ," he aid , "I 
question if the other candidate rea\ly wants 
it. " 

Bagneris emphasized his "i ue," lands. 
and made . orne campaign promise:. 

He pr mi ed to . el up a commi sion to 
invest igate and audit the book_ tore. and to do 
the arne for rising hou 'ing co. ts. 

He promi:sed to increase funding for K DT. 
the camplls radio ·tation (see tory p, 4). He 
promi 'ed to increase funding to "alternat ive 
med ia " like the 1leU' iudicato/' and Peopl(' 's 
Voice. and . though the AS ha: no control or 
even influence over til GlIardiml' financ s or 
operation. he said he ~ ould work to have the 
Guardian come out more than twice a week. 

The largest difference between the two 
cand idates ca me in their attitude toward the 
administration, 

Bagneris said he would not mind an 
antagonisti c relation hip with the 
admini tration. "You've got to wheel and deal 
with tho e guys. and they 're going to put a 
many roadblocks as they can."you have to be 
able to get what you want from them." 

Harris tried to play up his closeness to the 
campus administration. " I know where 

they'recomin~ from and they know where I'm 
'~Tl1ing from,' he said . "We get things done." 

"The whole program-
ming commission uses 
this table," apologizes1 
Harris, pointing to the 
many manila folders. old 
Gllardia"s and a sorted 
paper work which lie 
about the office. 

He open one of the 
folder and run his finger 
down a list of events 
sponsored by this year's 
programming co mmis· 
ion. " We had a hell of a 

time getting money (from 
the AS council ) for all the 
activitie we wanted," he 
comments. 

Most ly , Harris, a 
presidential candidate in 
today's run·off, hopes that 
all his paper work and the 
many event put on by his 
commission this year will 
leave the impression of a 
hard worker in the mind 
of student voters.

Bagneris has a plan 
for his candidacy 

continued from page 5 
many tuden t politicos have doubts 
about him as a representative of 
student interests. 

"It was hard to get Jules to be 
objective about a lot of issues that 
came before the Council," said Irene 
Flores, chairwoman of the Third 
College Counci l when Bagneris was a 
member. 

"He tend to get 0 wrapped up in an 
issue that it's impossible to cha nge his 
mind once it' made up." 

And Jon Bekken, who worked with 
Bagneris on the St udent Center Board 
this year, and wi ll vote for him in 
todav 's el ct ion, b Ii v s "some 
things Jule does are self-seeking. 

"Jule does appear to do things to 
promote himself, and he does ide 
with the administration more than I'd 
like ... But he does have a genuine 
concern about the univers ity," 
Bekken said . 

Ba~neris is well-aware of the 
criticism that surrounds his run-off 
campaign, and has a solid explanation 
for it. 

"Ne~ative forces have always tried 
to get In the way of positive change," 
he said. "That's just what 's 
hap,pening in this (run-off) campaign. 

'Those individuals who've had a 
stake in keeping the AS closed to 
students, you know, the traditional 
politicos, the old time ASers, are 

Clui ... tian Dinr 

opposing me. " 
Ken Overton, president of the Black 

Students Union and a supporter of the 
Res pect With Pers pective s late 
Ba?,neri head , agrees. 

I In the past the AS has not been an 
effective advocate of stu dent 
interests. It 's been a bureaucratic 
body," said Overton. "Jule and Alma 
(Key, vice presidential run -off 
contender) plan to organize students 
to fight for their interests. That 
should be the main function of a 
government. " 

Bagn eris believe s " totall y 
groundless rumors" that h ha_ 
threatened to fire everal taft 
members in the AS office if elected 
have been circulated by "negative 
forces" to "smear (his) campaign. " 

" It' s totally untrue (that he 
threatened to layoff s taff people)," 
Bagneris said . " I do think there is 
unnecessary friction existing between 
staff and the old·time politicos." 

Bagneris believes "the staff needs 
new leadership to come into the AS to 
get rid of this division." 

The AS president could legally fire 
only one staff member, the one whose 
salary is paid bytheAS_ Everyone else 
who works in the office is paid for by 
Reg fee.

Harris runs for office 
on his AS record 
continued from page 5 
are aware of what goes on in ide the 
AS council to bring about such event 
as TGIF's. Con equently, only a few 
students are in a position to access 
Harris' performance a commi sioner 
of programming. 

Most of the members of the AS 
council (who have worked with Harris 
this year) have positive things to say 
about him. 

" Amiable, apolitical and studen t-
orien ted," were three adjectives Muir 
Representative Pam Gerber used to 
describe Harri . 

Linda abo, chairwoman on the 
tudent Bod y Pr , ident' Council , 

called Harri s " the mo t organized 
per on on the AS council this year." 
And she added, "I don't think Josh is 
apolitical. He knows what he know 
and knows what he doesn ' t know." 
. But, says Academi c Affair s 
Commissioner Lee Anderson, "it was 
plentiful programming, but it wasn't 
diverse.' Specifically, Anderson 
pointed to the lack of funding for 
Cinco de Mayo festivities tomorrow. 
(The festivities will be funded , but 
through commissions other than 
programming.) 

And Anderson warned that "as an 
AS president, (Harris) will need to 
represent (more diverse student 
interests). He hasn't served as a 
representative on the programming 

commission this year." 
Like Anderson, Third Representa-

tive Mitch Sosna, an unsuccessful 
candidate for president , has mixed 
feelings abou t Harris' job on the 
council. 

'" feel that what he did , he did well . 
But he didn't provide programming in 
the interest of all students, as regards 
to Blacks, women and Chicanos_" He 
said , "They were the same old 
programs. They lacked imagination." 

But Sosna also mentioned that 
Harris ha "a lot of good qualitie . 

"It basically come down to a 
(positive) attitude_ If he doe n't 
alway have knowledg of the issue , 
he can at lea t work well with people," 
So na commented . 

And how doe J ule Bagneris, 
Harris' opponent , access Harris ' 
performance on the AS council this 
year? 

"Harris didn't promote as diverse 
programming as the \constitutional) 
byI2'.·!s call for,' Bagneris 
commented. "Most of the program-
ming was aimed at the student over 21 
(who can drink at the TGIF's). It's the 
emphasis on beer that forces a 
(younger) student to try to emulate 
someone that 's 21 ," Bagneris said. 

How does Harris rate himself as a 
commissioner of programming? 

"This is the first year in a lon~ time

The Yogonut tree, thought to be extinct, 
has bounced back. And it's full of those 
special gifts that once made it a legend: 
Apples, raspberries, raisins, sunflower 
seeds . _. even little cups of yogurt. 

Once found everywhere, the Yogonut 
tree dropped out of sight due largely to 0 
public preference for factory food in the 
1950's. This trend has reversed itself, 
however. A campus spokesperson announced 
that the trees have been brought on to 
campus for the good of all. 

Now it's easy to protect the Yogonut 
tree. And good tosting too. Becouse all the 
natural things from the Yogonut tree are 
packed into the Yogonut™ bor. Which is 
packed in stores everywhere. 

So enjoy the Yogonut bar. And protect 
a legend, please.

Triton crews tnake strong weekend showings 
Men row hard Women strokers triumphant 

BY NANCY LEE 
Staff Writer 

UCSD Men's Crew had an 
exciting Regatta at Loyola· 
Marymount University on 
Saturday, hitting the cold 
waters at 8 in the morning. 

The Tritons swept Loyola 
in all three categories: the 
Lightweight eight, the 
Novice eight and Open four . 
This is the first win over 
Loyola in the past two years 
of competition for UCSD. 

The Lightweight ei~ht 
took an early lead, finishlOg 
the race with a one second 
advantage. 

UCSD was rowing in a boat 
that they hadn't used before , 
which probably slowed them 
slightly in the race. 

In their 'race, the Novice 
eight sprinted out and took 
the lead, continuing strong 

throughout the race to win 
easily. 

The Open four boat had an 
even easier sweep over 
Loyola, extending their 
beginning lead throughout 
the race. Alexis Wieland, the 
the number two position, 
commented on the excellent 
job performed by Doug 
Mehaffey who stroked for the 
Open four. 

"The last two or three year 
Loyola has swept us 
consistently. We were . .. 
gunning for this race, and all 
of us were really happy with 
the results," remarked John 
Kirchmeier, assistant coach 
for the crews. 

The UCSD leightweights 
are in good position to win the 
Western Sprints.

Staff Writer 

On Saturday the 
Women's National Rowing 
Association Regional 
Regatta for the South 
West was held at the Long 
Beach Marine Station . 
The UCSDWomen's Crew 
competed against schools 
and clubs such as UCLA, 
Humboldt State, Cal State 
Long Beach, Mills College 
and Lake Merritt Rowing 
Club. All of UCSD's teams 
raced at the regionals, 
with the Novice and 
Lightweight four' s doing 
exceptionally well. 

The Lightweight four 
took first in their heat, 
running a close second to 
Loyola·Marymount in the 
finals. The times for the 

University 
Events 
presents: 

first and second places in 
the finals were 4:07.9 and 
4:11.0. 

The Novice four boat 
"medaled" their race in 
the finals with a winning 
time of 4:05.5. The four 
women who crewed the 
1,000 meter race wt'reJene 
Manset·coxswain, Martha 
Stack lin - stroke, Bonnis 
Clifford - number three 
position, Mary Egan -
two position and Carla 
Stewart - bow. 

The Lightweight eight 
came in second in their 
race but were disqualified 
for a lane violation. 

The Novice eight took a 
fourth in the heat, failing 
to qualify for the finals by 
a single placing. 

The UCSD Women 's 

Crew are looking towards 
the upcoming National 
Regattas in both the 
Intercollegiate and NWRA 
competition. 

The Intercollegiate 
Nationals, to be held on 
May 23 in Oakland this 
season, are by invitation 
only. T he UCSD Light· 
weight women have been 
invited to participate, 
based on their fall record, 
one half of their spring 
seas"n and their results at 
the San Diego Crew 
Classic. 

Coach Jack Vallarga, 
said that his lightweight 
women ..... had beaten all 
other California college 
crews, and in the las t three 
years they have won 80 
percent of their races."

Softball's humming 
BY VALERI S. ANDERS 

UCSD's intercollegiate 
women's softball team has 
come a long way from its 1·14 
record of last year. 

Thanks to the new Head 
Coach Don Monteverde and 
lots of 'hard work from the 
players, women's softball is 
now 9·7, and the team has its 
eyes on the regional 
championships (May 7·9). 

Team positions are played 
well, and the talent of the 
players shows in their 
individual records as well as 
the teams overall record . 

Kathy Clasby, who plays a 
strong right field, has been a 
real asset at bat also. "She 
always gets a piece of the ball 
when she's at bat," said 
Monteverde. 

Teammate Vanessa Davis 
is getting her share of hits as 
well. Davis had homeruns in 
three consecutive games last 
week. 

"These players know how 
to win. and th y don 't let 
themselves get down, " 
Monteverde stated, adding 
that the seriousne s of the 
players has been a major 

contributor to their winning 
season. 

Third base player Bonnie 
Betz had four straight games 
with no errors this past week. 
Betz is also a third string 
pitcher, taking the mound 
when Liz Burrill or Rita 
Uribe are out. 

Uribe has been a definite 
defensive plus to the team. 
"She's learned how to work 
the change up pitch into her 
pitching style. One girl 
actually swung twice at one 
of Rita's pitches, before the 
ball ever reached the plate," 
aid Coach Monteverde. 
Although most of the 15 

players are new to UCSD this 
year, daily practice sessions 
have created a strong team 
unit. The players encourage 
each other on and off the 
fie ld, a s does Coach 
Monteverde and Assistant 
Coach Scott Harkness. 

The effort Monteverde and 
Harkness have put in sho.ws, 
and as the team head 
towards regionals. the 
dedication of coaches and 
players has proven to payoff. 

Spikers vs. Rough 
BY VALERI S. ANDERS 

When the undefeated 
Highland Spikers played 
undefeated Rough and Ready 
in team volleyball doubles 
this weekend , the two teams 
could lay claim to being 
among the best in the world 
- most ly because their game 
is bizarre enough to be 
practiced almost nowhere 
else. 

The Highland Spikers won 
the match, five games to one, 
and what they had to do to 
win it would tax an EECS 
major. 

Each leam ha . four player 
- two men and two women. 
Each person on each team 
pair up with each teammate 
for one game, to 15 point . 
There are six combination 
to keep track of, thus a match 
of ix game . 

Keith Tat ukawa of Rough 
and Ready made everal 
diving pIa , which ended 

with him sliding on the floor, 
but it was not enough to 
overtake the all·staff member 
Highland Spikers. 

Having only two players to 
cover each side of the court 
makes for fast action, and 
much yelling of "I go." It 
takes competitive players, 
with the combined abi lity of 
team tenni s and beach 
volleyball. Scrambling tr 
cover all areas of the COUI l 
leave player exhausted by 
the end of ix game . 

"Our other matches have 
been nothing like thi . This 
was competitive volleyball ," 
said Arianne Neumark of 
Rough and Ready. 

Mick Laverofth Highland 
Spikers used his experience 
to overcome the team of Carol 
Beck and Andy Deneyer 15·2. 
The piker are now 3·0 in 
the sea on, looking forward 
to next week's battle with 
Nicky's Nets.

Women's 
tennis 
champs 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
sport. Editor 

The women's tennis squad 
posted back to back league 
victories over the weekend to 
earn top honors in t he 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Conference. 

On Friday, the women 
netters swept Cal Lutheran 
College 9·0, and Saturday the 
Tritons handed Westmont 
College a 7·2 drubbing. 

[n Saturday's match, 
number one seed Cecilia 

Kavanau~h , undefeated in 
NCAA DIvision III fJlay this 
year , dropped her opponent 6· 
4, 6·2. Also excellent in the 
singles bracket were Laura 
Saavedra (7·6, 6·2), Lisa 
Gilbert (6·2 , 6·3) and 
Elizabeth Saar (6·2, 6·0). 

The highlight of Sat· 
urday 's singles competition 
came in Karen Barr's three· 
et victory. Barr dropped the 

first et, 5·7, but overcame 
four match points to win the 
final sets 6·4, 7·5. 

In doubles, the Triton's 
Kavanaugh and Saavedra 
were upset 6·1, 6·7, 4·6. 

Gilbert and Saar coupled to 
win 7·5, 6·3, while Barbara 
O'day teamed with Barr to 
win in three sets, 4·6, 6-4,6-3. 

The Triton netters went 
undefeated in league play 
this year, 6·0, while 
maintaining an overall 
record of 14·8. 

The league regionals 
scheduled for May 16 will 
match the Tritons with 
strong competition from UC 
Davis and Occidental 
College, and Coach Liz 
Dudash is entertaining hopes 
of a good showing. 

"We should do fairly well 
in the regionals ," she says. 
"Li a (Kavanaugh) should do 
very well in her matches, but 
there are going to be a lot of 
good players." 

UCSD will compete in the 
league tournament this 
weekend, a primer for the 
upcoming regionals.

The GtuIrdI... 

007 as a cardboard incompetent 
New novel arrid and boring 

In 1953 a modestly 
successful ' blood and 
thunder' thriller called 
Casino Royale was published. 
written by a London Sunday 
Times newspaper columnist. 
It was followed a year later by 
Live And Lei Die, then a year 
later by Moonraker and so on, 
lIIntil 1964 when the 
columnist , now world 
famous be telling author 

, Ian Fleming, died. 
But his creation, a tough, 

sensuous, seemingly unde-
featable secret agent licensed 
to kill named J ames Bond 
lived on and ind eed 
flouri shed. In 1965, when 
Fleming 's final Bond 
adventure The Man With 
The Golden GUlI was 
publi s hed posth umou s ly 
(five months on the New York 
Times bestseller list), the 
nationwide 007 craze was at 
its height. The 14 Bond 
nQvels by Mr. Fleming 

(including two short story 
colectionsFor Your Eyes Only 
and Octopussy) sold by the 
millions every week and still 
the pu blic hungered for more. 

And , so it seems, they still 
do today . By 1978, the film 
serie had raked in an 
incredible one billion 

by John Gardner. 
The heirs of Ian Fleming 

had tried once before to 
continue the saga of james 
Bond when they had 
Kingsley Amis write Colo~/el 
Sun (1968). Actually, Sun

admissions and that was 
before Mool1raker 1979), the 
rna t successful of the 11 
movies, had been released. 
This summer a twelfth 007 
film will be released and good 
old Mr. Bond , still the 
ultimate symbol of fantasy 
fulfillm ent , seems to be 
reachin~ to new height in 
popularity. In the wake of all 
this hero worshin comes t.he

the book was a flop sa les·wise 
and as a lit erary property. 
Bond was laid to rest until 
this month.

ture, and it fails mi serably on 
both counts. The plot is a 
rehash of both Dr. No and 
Goldfitlger. The vi llian. one 
Laird of Murcaldy, is a mad 
scientist whom the world has 
scorned , so he plots revenge. 
Sound familiar? It' s only been 
done 8,000 times over the last 
100 year . The Laird. whose

asked for a getaway plane if 
he didn 't already have one. 
Bond, of course. stumbl es

much of the novel as Murik ' 
prisoner in a medieval castle 
wit h a beautiful blonde 
nam ed , of all thing. 
Lavender Peacock! Things 
become almost unbearable 

when Lavender reveals her 
nickname is 'Dilly.' 

Needless to say, Gardner i 
no Ian Fleming. He's not even 
a Kingsley Am is. The world 
of Fleming' james Bond is 
one of unbelievable exploits, 
biz zare villi ans, graphic 
battle s and amorou 
encounter . Fleming appeal s 
directly to the sen es with 
lucid description and a choice 
selec t ion of adject i ves . 
Gardner's writing is arrid , 
barren and boring, overly 
influenced by the film s and 
just plain wrong. H.is vi l1ian. 
are normal nobodies, his gi rl s 
are sexless wonder: and hi s 
007 i ' a cardboard incompe-

Gardner mentions five to 
seven brand name ' per

Renewed an authentic 007 
experience. The narrative is 
loaded to the gills with 
gadgets and gimmick s, 
including a Goldfinger movie-
type trick car, and thi s is 
completely unlike the real 
fictional Bond, who relied 
only on his wits , stamina and 
whatever odd weapon he 
found hand y 

, This Bond makes .stupid 
mistakes he would otherwise 
never make (driving hi s car 
into a ditch he knew about 
allowing him to be recap-
tured , etc) only to prolong and 
pad the book out to a 
respectable length . Then 007 
acrifices the lives of millions 

across the globe to attempt to 
save one girl whom he has not 
even properly bedded down! 
At one point in his captivity 
he blurts out , " I don't know 

how long I can stand it. " This 
is james bond? ' 

'Further irritations include 
an incredibly nieve villian 
who happily reveals to Bond 
every s ingle detail of hi 
doomsday plan from causes 
and effects to where, how and 
when ... a complete lack of sex (007 must be getting old , 
indeed) and a mere squib of a

Experience 
Sallladhi 

with Atmananda 

Atmananda-Dr. Frederick LenZisa 
spiritual Benefactor. Each month, in addition to guiding his own 
initiated students, he offers several free workshops to members of the 
San Diego community. During meditation, Atmananda enters into 
Samadhi and directly channels Peace, Light, Power and Ecstasy to 
you. Having this direct experience in Cosmic Consciousness will give 
you a psychic "boost" that will add to your own feeling of well being 
and will increase your spiritual awareness. It is in this manner-by 
sitting in meditation with an Illumined person while they are in 
Samadhi - that higher meditation is taught. No words or techniques 
can equal this experience in Self Discovery. After having had this 
experience you will find it easier to enter into the supraconscious states 
on your own. 

You are cordially invited to attend the following workshop. There 
is no charge for admission. It is sponsored by the San Diego 
Meditation Club of UCSD.

Song and story 

Garthwaite, Sorrels & Hawkins 
A. Eft .... 01 So ..... Stery is a mixture of music and 

poetry, of the familiar and the unfamiliar, of lhe IlPirit of urban and 
rural America, featuring aingen/.:>ngwrilers Terry Garthwaite and 

Roealie Sorrels. and poet/writer Bobbie LouiM Hawkins. 
Garthwaite transcends her Joy of Cooking days (Cooking was a 
female·led band in the late 60's and early 70's) - me is an 
accomplished guitarist and songwriter, and a stirring vocaliat. Sorrels 
is a walking tracitional songbook with a strong lIOic. and completely 
unpretentious manner. Hawkil1l is a poet and \/Ifil.r with familial 
roots in West Texas and proflSlionai rools in the art world. She gives 

stunni~ evocalive readings from her four books - work. deeply 
embedded in the place and personality of the rural American West. 

TIle subject of the firsl piece of the _ning is a spontaneous 
decision that sparks themes which detmnine the direction and 
character of the rest of the performance. Each woman establishes a 
penonatity and rhythm of performance that complements and 
enhances what her two fellololl periomMrrl do. Being with these Ihree 
women is like spending an evening..,;th strangers who rapidly break 
through the waD between artisl.nd audience and become friends. By 
the end of the _ning you are left with many magical momentnnd a 
wonderful p that only the most inIIoIving perfonne" can betOloll.

Kent State fight for restitution

trial ended when. once again. 
witnesses could not place the 
defendant at the scene of the 
aime, In a surprise move, the 
prosecutor announced that 
the state was dropping all 
remaining indictments_ 

After the killings of two 
students at Jackson State 
University in Mississippi on 
May 14, 1970, Richard Nixon 
appointed a commission to 
investigate campus unrest in 
general and the incidents at 

. Kent and Jackson State in 
particular, Nixon appointed 
William -Saanton. Republi-

- can governor of Pennsylvan-
ia. to chair the commission. 
When Joseph Rhodes. Jr" the 
sole student member of the 
commission. said he wanted 
to find out why the Guard 
w. sent to Kent State in the 
first place. Spiro Agnew 
demanded his resignation_ 
Rhodes -refused_ 

The Scranton commision. 
as it came to be known, held 
thirteen days of hearings and 
compiled a 537-page report_ 
Although the commission 

was granted subpeona power 
and its aut horization 
provided that no testimony 
could be used in subsequent 
crim inal troceedings. 
subpeone guardsmen 
invoked the fifth Amendment 
and refused to testify_ 
General Canterbury and 
Major Del Corso. however, 
did testify _ Canterbury swore 
that the situation was so 
critical just prior to the 
shootings that many 
members of the commission 
would also have fired on the 
students_ All photographs of 
the General at this critical 
time. however. show him 
with his back to the 
demonstrators, 

General Canterbury also 
told the Scranton Commis-
sion that at the time his 
troops opened fire. the 
attacking students were 
within five feet of the 
surrounded guardsmen_ 
Photographs. however. show 
that the guardsmen were not 
surrounded and that Joseph

der was killed by a bullet 
entering his back while he 
was lying prone facing away 
from the guardsmen _ He was 
382 feet from the Guard. 
Sandra Scheuer was 390 feet 
from the Guard when a bullet 
crashed throu~h her neck. 
severing her Jugalar vein, 
She bled to death as the 
guardsmen turned and 
marched away. 

In 1974, a Federal Grand 
Jury indicted eight guards-
men who had admitted firing 
at the students. They were 
charged with violating the 
students' civil rights by 
shooting them _ After a 

lengthy trial, the federal 
judge took the case away 
from the jury, ruling that 
there had been no evidence 
that any ~uardsmen 
specifically Intended to 
deprive the students of their 
civil rights.Attorney General 
Richard Kleindeist did not 
appeal from the decision_ The 
guardsmen went free_ 

Meanwhile. civil suits filed 
by injured students and the 
famihes and estates of those 
who were killed dragged on _ 
When the cases were 
originally filed in 1970. the 
judge had thrown them out of 
court citing the legal doctrine 
of sovereign immunity. 
which was the modem-day 
equivilant of the common law 
doctrine that the King could 
do no wrong, The plaintiffs 
appealed · all the way to the 
US Supreme court. which 
decided on April 17. 1974. 
that recovery against the 
state and its officers could be 
had if the plaintifs could 
prove that the government 
officials did not act in good 
faith and with reasonable 

grounds for their beliefs at 
the time they acted_ The case 
was remanded to be tried in a 
Federal District trial court. 

The trial dragged on for 
months. During the course of 
the trial, it was learned that 
at least one juror had been 
pushed against a courthouse 
wall and told that his hou e 
and family would be blown 
up if he did not vote 
"correctly_" He continued to 
sit on the jury. which 
deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of 
the defendants_ 

Once again. the plaintiffs 
appealed_ The United States 
Court of Appeals ordered a 
new trial because of the juror 
intimidation, The case was 
sent back to the onginal trial 
judge for a new trial. During 
pre-trial stages of the 
litigation. the judge made it 
clear to the attorneys for the 
wounded and dead that they 
wuld have a very difficult 
time prevailing in a second 
trial. With the judge's 
admonition in mind. the 
plaintiffs' attorneys recom-

24 The Guardian . Monday, May 4, 1981 

Harris' record Chicano communities: ' The BSU took the same tanc toward the campaign of Black presidential contender Robe rt 
Tambuzi last year. continued from page 7 

that a commissioner of programming 
has lasted a whole year. (Last year's 
council had two commissioners of 
programmi"¥). We've establised a 
very profeSSIOnal commission." 

As proof, he cites this year's Spirit 
Night at which beer trought from 
Administrations funds was served. 

(with the help of the Uni.versity 
Events Office) Tanks as one of the 
most important. 

When asked about his background 
as a programmer, Harris commented, 
"(if elected), I will definitely affect 
programming. I consider program· 
ming and public relations the most 
important commissions on the AS 
council." 

But now that Bagneris has made 
the run·off, "students will be able to 
look at the two candidates (Bagneris 
and Joshua Harris) and their positions 
on the issues more closely, and 
hopefully, this will cut down on the 
unjustified bias that exists," said 
Overton. 

While the BSU does back the 
Respect With Perspective slate, it has 
not endorsed the campaign officially. 

Overton noted that "people alway! 
associate the slate with the BSU 
indicating that it only supports BStJ 
interests. Respect With Perspective 
supports student interests, which are 
our interests too. It 

"U we weren't a professional 
organization, we could have never 
managed to get the administration to 
(fund a drinking event)," Harris said. 

Of all the events put on by his 
commission, Harris believes that 
brin¢ng the .Greg Kihn Band to UCSD 

Bagneris 
continued from page 7 
to the idea of a Black president) than 
people who come from Black or 

" There are people in our 
organization who are directly 
involved with the campaign," said 
Overton. "But since most of the 
individual (SSU) members support 
the candidacy of Jules and Alma, we 
saw no need to finalize it (by officially 
endorsing their effort)." 

Kent State 
was a 
massacre 
continued from pale 2 
mended settlem·ent. On 
January 4, 1979, the State of 
Ohio approved a settlement 
for the living plaintiffs and 
the estates oj the dead 
students. Student Deafl 
Kahler, permanently para: 
Iyzed by a guardsman's 
bullet, received $350,000, the 
lion's·share of the settle· 
ment. Each of the other 
plaintiffs, or their estates, 
received approximately 
$15,000. By paying the 
settlement, the state of Ohio 
may have legally washed its 
hands of the matter, but as 
the mother of a slain student 
said, "It doesn't matter to me 
one way or the other. Do you 
think I m going to touch that 
blood money? Would that pay 
for my child's life?" 

KSDT not nteeting 
AS bail-out tertns 
continued from pale 4 
sufficiency. Yet our 
advertising IS picking up 
substantially. We had more 
contracts in the last six 
months than in the last five 
years put together." 

It has been during the last 
six months that Larsen , 
KSDT 's onl y salaried 
employee, has worked at the 
station. KSDT hired him 
with a one·time grant of 
$3000 from the Chancellor's 
Discretionary Fund. His 
contract, however, expired 
on April 30. From now on, he 
witt be earning only 
commission on his sales 
which is "not enough to live 
off of," so he will be looking 
for another full·time job, 
while working at KSDT in 
the evenings. 

Larsen has organized a 
student sales staff which will 
perform many of his old 

duties. He is confident they 
will be successful. 

"One of our biggest 
problems, of course, has been 
lack of on·campus transmis-
sion. Once we are able to go 
into La Jolla and tell 
businesses that we have a 
subtstantial on-campus 
audience, our advertising 
sales should definitely pick 
up." 

The other problem facing 
KSDT when soliciting major 
advertisers is demographics. 
Because their music does not 
cater to the most popular, 
lowest common denommator 
taste, but is now only listened 
to by those who have cable 
FM radio (Cable FM 95.7), 
they cannot point to listener 
preference surveys, like 
Arbitron (radio's Nielsen 

ratin~s), to show the 
potentJal advertiser the size 
of their radio audience.
