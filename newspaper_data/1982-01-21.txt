New tax proposal A Different Angle 
Can American citizen still 

afford to scream, ''I'm mad as 
hell and 1'm nog goi ng to take it 
anymore" when they receive 
their tax forms in the mail? 

The "me first" battle cry 
that led to drastic property tax 
cut in uch tates as 
Ma sachusett and California 
may go down in history as the 
fiasco of the late 1970s. 

Spiraling federal deficits 
after deep budget cu t have led 
even the Reagan administra-
tion to consider levying excise 
taxes before the end of the 
calendar year. Budgetary 

hortfalls are simultaneously 
sapping state treasuries and 
leading some statehouses to 
break a cardinal rule: Don't 
raise taxe during a recession. 

Meanwhile, in Ma sachu-
sells itself, where tax revolt 
fever climaxed a year ago in 
Proposition 21h (and cau ed 
street demonstrat ions over 
Boston's fire protection) citie 
have been given the authority 

to exempt them elve ' from the 
law and keep public employees 
on the payroll. 

Here in California, however, 
where Propo ition 13 gave the 
tax revolt its start, a group of 
liberal political activists are 
trying to get what's left out of 
the "mad-a -hell" mania and 
put it to work for everyone, 

The Sacramento- based 
Californian' Tax Reform 
A sociation ' Split Role 
Property Tax Initiative would, 
if approved next November, 
extend property tax relief to 
thousands of new homeown-
er here who've bought' a 
house or moved since 1978 and 
aren't eligible for super-low 
tax breaks, 

Tired of high mortgages, 
inequitable assessments and 
ever-increasing local fees in 
the wake of Proposition 13's 
cutbacks (it's not uncommon 
here to pay $1,000 for a sewer 
hookup on new homes), Split

The preppies are coming!

AP&M building, new Stan

my jaw dropped off, my eyelids 
reces ed and my pupil dilated

was a look usually reserved for 
car accidents, very pretty 
girls, or big-wave wipeout. 

Thi was something 
different. This was horrible, It 
wa a preppie, 

I stared at him as he and his 
topsiders strolled down the 
corridor, He wore light blue, 
belted s lacks , I didn 't 
recognize the material, it 
wasn't denim or corduroy, His 
striped shirt was cuffed at the 
sleeves and a white sweater 
was tied around his neck, He 
was clean shaven despite the 
early hour - 11 :00 AM - and 
his hair was perfectly blow-
dried. 

type shorts cia 'hed with my 
Carta Blanca t -shirt. 1 v

didn't match, 

I shook myself, cleared my 
head , and kept walking, I 
growled at the startled preppie 
as I passed him. He made me 
mad and also a little worried. 

Preppie fashions are just the 
beginning, I hypothesized, 
Next , shoes will be required on 
campus, and we'll be wearing 
coats and ties to class, 
Probably an Administration 
plot. 

I felt a need to share my 
fears, and warn unsuspecting 
students, 

A group was tanding 
outside the building, I ran up 
to them, 

"To arms! To arms!" I cried. 
"T here 's a preppie on 
campus." 

They looked bored, 

preppies and the Reagan 
Administration, Many feel it is 
a backlash to au terity, a 
reI urn to materiali ' m and 
snobbery." 

I digested this information. 
;'But, but," I stuttered, waving 
my arms to encompass the 
campus, "they ' re here! In 
Southern California,at UCSD. 
Why i n't anybody doing 
anything? Where are the 
marches and protests? The 
riot and sit -ins?" 

The group started to break 
up. 

"Nobody cares," 
"Yeah, this isn 't the '60's, 

People aren't ready to get 
arrested for a cause anymore." 

One of them put a hand on 
my shoulder, "Relax," he told 
me, "it's just a fad . It'll die out 
someday." He raised his fi st in 
salu teo "Levi Power." He 
grinned and walked away. 

If you have an opinion, write it down and send 
it to us, All we ask is that letters to the editor be 
typed triple-spaced using a 72-space line, 

My first feelings were of 
revulsion and di sgust. I had 
long fearcd a fashion 
movement at UCSD, To me, 
the campus repre, ented one of 
the strongest bastions of 
scroungy apparel, a sanctuary 
in a jungle of designer labels. 
Still, I couldn't help but feel 
self-conscious next to this

asked me, "The place is filthy

"Yeah," agreed another,

Letting the nuclear industry off the hook 
By HOWARD KOHN 

Pacific Ne ws Service

nuclear company that is guilty 
of dozens of 'afety violations 
but never has been fined by the 
appropriate reulatory agen-

Not according to the recent 
decision by the 10th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Denver, 
The appellate court over-

verdict against the Kerr-
McGee Corp., awarded by a 
jury to the family of Karen 
Silkwood, the nuclear worker 
in Oklahoma who had been 
contaminated with plutonium 
in her apartment. 

Silkwood was working 
undercover for her union at

Californians plan 
new tax changes 
continued from page 2 
Role's supporters want to 
reduce' their own tax burden, 
In addition, the initiative 
would increase renters' credits 
to $100 for singles and $300 for 
couples, . 

Byas essing higher taxes on 
business and commercial 
property, the initiative 
sponsors hope to rai e up to 
$1.6 billion for depleted tate 
coffers to pay for parks, 
librari es. police ..and fire 
protection. Already, the 
busines -backed group 
Californians Against High 
Taxes has vowed to spend 
whatever it take to crush 
Split Role. 

With busine ses anxious to 
preserve their low tax base, 
politicians of all stripes have 
done their best to dis uade the 
tax reformers from placing 
Split Role on the ballot. Gov, 
Jerry Brown, who 'faces a 
Senate race next year (a well 
a budget hortfalls of $747 
million in 1982 and $3 billion 
in 1983), "just doesn't want to 
deal with it, " said one aide. 

Yet there's a lesson in the 
California initiative fif,ht for 
all Americans, Like the rest of 
Ameri ca (o nly more so) 
Californians have tasted a 
round of stiff budget cuts and 
realized their appreciation for 
sound government services. 
The question remains: Who's 
going to pay for them? Even 
initiative pollsters report that 

E • 

a majority of Californian are 
immensely dissatisfied with 
cuts in social services. 

Similar reaction is becoming 
vi ible at the national level. 
The Los Angele Times/ Cable 
News Network Poll reported 
last week that 64 percent of all 
Americans favor "consump-
tion taxe" on alcohol and 

' tobacco to help balance the 
budget. In addition, the poll 
indicated widespread support 
for closing loopholes in the tax 
code and impo ing a windfall 
profit , tax on deregulated 
nat ural gas, 

There was, however, a 
feeling among Americans that 
increased taxes on either 
gasoline, income or sales was 
not a good idea. 

One might wonder why the 
nation has moved so quickly 
from tax-cut fever a year ago to 
fits of "revenue enhancement" 
today. But this new attitude 
may have been born out of the 
harsh reality of a truncated 
government. 

For the record, the brain 
trust behind the California 
initiative has correct ly 
pinpointed an inequity of 
Proposition 13: The 1978 
measure did no lower taxes on 
subsequently-purchased pro-
perty, putting an unfair 
burden on new homeowners, 

Moreover, the initiative 
supporters are hopi ng to

Editor: 

Critic ism of t he country's 
government and /or pre ident 
hows not only a lack of 

ignorance, but the precise type 
of checks and awareness that 
i needed to "wake up" a nd 
keep t h is country free and not 
oppressed . The objection that 
UCSD radicals have been 
accu ing Reagan a nd savagi ng

is not. This argument was 
backe d by a barrage of 
percentage and dollar s ign 
compa ri ng soc ia l service 
spending then (1964) to now, 
without comparing military 
spend ing, then to now. Things 
are more expensive and there 
are mor e of us. 

The facts are that 
education , the art, ecology, 
conserv at ion, science re-
search . soc i a l be nefits, 
etcetera, have been or will be 
cut while the military remain 
alive and well. Cartoonists 
wit h captions such as "you've 

(Reagan) made it fu n to be rich 
a~a in " a r e getti ng t heir 
information from somewhere 
and [doubt that the source are 
UC D "radical " . T rue, petty 
backs tabs at t he man and hi 
ad ministration are useless and 
chi ld ish, however, a realistic 
awar eness of it working and 
their true significance are not 
what [ wou Id consider "a 
radical movement of ideologi -
ca I weakness". 

Think, for ju t one example, 
of the gag order that s wept 
Reagan's entire adminis tra-
tion ju t four days ago, 
prohibiting its members (down 
to the Department of 
Agriculture) from speaking to 
the pre without direct 
clearance · from the White 
House. "Don't be misled ,"

hear what they're not s aying.

concerned about balanced

need for adequate public

Yet, de pite evidence of 
tolerance for raising certain

folks are ell ing their package

renters to support s t icking

The st rategy of Split Role 
may indicate that tax 
initiative are no more 
immune than are legislators to 
the political pressures of the 
times. As long as legislators 
are unwilling to tell taxpayers 
to take the tough medicine, 
initiatives will continue to bea 
less- than-perfect alternative. 

The American public may

dismi ing its need for some 
government services and

SACRAMENTO - A bill 
whic h would allow UC 
students to withhold part of 
their mandatory regi tration 
fees w hich help fund abortions 
passed a major hurdle last 
week as it was approved 6-0 by 
the Senate Educati on 
Committee. 

T he bill , wh ich also applies 
to the CSU and community 
college systems actuall y 
proh ibits t he UC Regents from 
denying any s t udent admis-
s ion, readmission, and other 
s tudent privileges because he 
or she refuses to pay for 
abortions or abortion referral 
services. 

But legis lators removed a 
portion of the bill which would 
have placed abortion counsel-
ing among the list of ser vices 
s tudents will not be required 
to fund. 

The bill must now go to the 
full Senate, where passage i 
expected, and then on to the 
Assembly where UC and 

student officials predicted the 
measure will face a tougher 
ride. 

According to Daniel Grimm, 
administrative assistant to 
Senator John Doolittle, R-
Sacramento, the bill 's sponsor, 
2,000 abortions are performed 
each year u s ing mon ey 
California college s tudents pay 
for by insurance premiums 
bought with registration fees. 

Several proponents of the 
bill , some who brought their 
children. testified that they 
object to abortions and s hould 
not have to pay for them . 

UC Davis graduate Andy 
Mendoza said "the university 
should not have the option of 
penalizing students who in 
good conscience don 't want to 
pay for abortion ." 

Mendoza recount ed an 
experience four years ago 
when he withheld his tudent 
fees, for which he said the 
universi ty threatened him 
with expul ion. 

But in April 1980 a an 
Diego Superior Court judge 

ruled that there was no law 
preventing the UC Regents 
from requiring full payment of 
fees. The ruling came in the 
case of a pro-life student who 
sued the univer ity . 

Doolittle introduced this bill 
in res ponse to that decision. 
The senator was not present 
yeste rda y to push hi 
legislation, but called upon 
Grimm and several pro-life 
representatives to testify. 

They pre se n ted the 
committee a petition signed by 
2,500 UC Davis s tudents who 
support the bill , and reported 
that a s tudent referendum 
held there yielded 44 percent in 
favor of fee withholding, even 
though voter were informed 
on the ballot that such 
legi lation could violate 
federal law. 

Several opponents of the 
bill, including repre entatives 
of the UC, the UC student 
lobby and various pro-choice 
group , appeared to speak 
against it. 

Rally celebrates 
legalized abortion 

Nancy McFadden of the 
California State Students 
A ociation warned that an 
"administrative nightmare" 
would result from having to 
weed out the cost of abortion 
ervices from tudent health 

fees . 
She added the difficulty 

would be worse at state 
univer ities because abort ion 
is only one facet of many 
cou nselors' work , and 
univers ity administrators 
would have to figure out what 
proportion of each counselor's 
time is s pent on abortion . 

The California Abortion 
Rights Action League will 
sponsor a noon rally and picnic 
in celebratin of the 9th 
annivers ary of the 1973 
Supreme Court Decision to 
legalize abortion, at Balboa 
park Saturday. 

Sue Punjack, President of 
the San Diego Chapter of 
NOW, National Organization 
o f Women , and Mar y 
Ye lv ington , Pres ident o f 
CARAL·South San Diego will 
speak at noon. The singing 
group "Womenson~" and 
Planned Parenthood.s Teen 

Theater will also perform. 
In keeping with the 

statewide slogan "Choice - as 
American as Apple Pie," s lices 
of apple pie will be passed out 
after the program. 

Everyone att ending the 
picnic will be invi ted to s ign a 
letter to President Reagan 
supporting CHOICE. Endors-
ers of the event include: San 
Diego Coun ty Chapter of the 
Natio nal Organization of 
Women, San Diego Chapter of 
National Women's Political 
Caucus and Planned Parent-
hood of San Diego. 

But after some discussion, 
the committee voted to remove 
counseling as one target of the 
measure. 

Asi-ie from the administra-
tive chores t hi bill wou Id 
entail, some opponents also 
criticized it from moral and 
ethical standpoints. 

Nancy Casady, lobbyist for 
the pro ·choi ce California

Panel kills 'bottle bill' 
cOJlIinued from page 5 

Rains presented evidence 
that 90 percent of cans and 
bottles sold in Oregon, the first 
state to pas a bottle bill, are 
returned , leaving the state 
litter free . He also said the 
laws have created job in tho e 
states in the recycling, 
transportation and marketing 
industries. 

But labor representatives at 
the meeting disputed those 
figure . Manuel Sierras, of the 
United Steelworkers Union 
estimated that 4-5,000 jobs 
would be lost in the state. He 
said in one Oregon plant alone 
100 jobs were lost when a 

machine which became 
unnecessary because of the 
law was removed. 

California Labor Federati rm 
President Jack Hanning 
attacked the proposed bottle 
bill as a "hobby for s leepless 
people at night over dehris 
clearance." He said it woule 
not be ocially conscientious to 
approve the bill while so many 
Californians are unemployed . 

After hi committee loss, 
Rains said proponents of the 
measure now face electoral 
opposition from labor leaders 
and beverage industries who 
will outspend them "by at 
least 200 to l." 

DOOIISBDIY 

Californians against Waste 
began gathering signatures in 
November to pla ce the 
mea ure on the statewide 
ballot. Kuzins has prai ed the 
work done on college 
campuses for the petition drive 
where he said 5-7 percent of 
the signatures 0 far received 
have been obtained. 

Rains said small contribu-
tions and continued media 
support will be used in efforts 
to pass the initiative . 
Literature prepared by CAW 
states that it ha the editorial 
support of 47 newspapers 
statewide including, Rains 
said, all the maior dailie .

Two bills would help state'sfiscal situation 
By HENRY SCHULMAN 

Sat."ralllcnto Correspondent 
ACRAMENTO - Gover-

nor Brown 's efforts to avoid a 
new tax increa e were boosted 
las t week as the state enate 
approved two "revenue 
enhancement" mea s ures 
designed to alleviate the states 
fi sca l s hortfall. 

The A embly mus t till 
approve several minor 
amendments to the bills made 
by the Senate before they can 
be sent to Brown for hi 
signature. 

Both bills, sponsored by 
Assemblyman Richard 
Robinson, D-Santa Ana, were 
introduced in the s pecial 
legislative session called last 

ovember to deal with the 
state's fi sca l crisis. 

The first measure, AB 6X, 
would speed up the collection 
of personal income taxes from 
businesses that withhold more 
than $350 per month from 

employees' paychecks. The 
Senate approved the bill by the 
narrowe t margin po . ible,21-
16. 

The Senate voted 32- 1 to 
approve AB 8X, which would 
increase the amount of 
interest charged on delinquent 
tax payments from the curre~t 
6-12 percent to 18 percent In 
1982. The only vote against 
the measure was cast by 
Senator John Schmit z, R-
Newport Beach, who Monday 
will face a censure from his 
colleagues. 

The state' Finan ce 
Department estimates the two 
speedups will generate $325 
million this fi sca l year to hore 
up an unexpected shortfall. 
Along with other tax 
acceleration, they compose 
the governor's $645 million 
revenue en hancemen t pro-
gram for next year, which he 
warned are necessary to avoi.d 

new taxes. 
Moments after the meas-

ure: were approved they were 
sen t to the Assembly for 
approva l of the Senate's 
amendments, which include 
reducing th amount of a 
payroll for which the lax 
acceleration applie, and 
requiring that the state also 
raise the interest rate it will 
pay to citizen whose tax 
refunds are delayed. 

The e amendments are seen 
as compromises Robinson 
made to ensure support in the 
Senate. Their approval in the 
A f;embly i expected. 

But A embly Minority 
Leader Robert Naylor. R-
Redwood City, requested and 
received a postponement on 
the bills. until Monday to 
discuss them in Republican 
Caucus. Republican in the 
Senate, most of whom voted 
against the income lax 

speedup, have Criticized it as 
being a tax increase . 

Majority Floor Leader Mike 
Roos , D-Los Angeles, reminded 
the Assembly that the bills 
must be approved quickly to 
sati fv tate controller Ken 
Cory: who last week said he 
may withhold state checks 
unle s the re\'enue measure 
are enacted. 

But Speaker Willie Brown, 
D-San Franci co, responded 
that "if we get the matter to 
the governor with urgency by 
Monday we may not have hurt 
our elves substantIall y. 

In an interview y sterday 
afternoon, R said there was 
no reason t he votes should 
have been postponed, given all 
the attention the bills have 
received _ "They had a 
legitimate cause to caucus 
about it, but they could have 
done it Monday, Tuesday or 
Wednesday," Roos sald_ 

Senate dehate on the income 
tax measure was character-
i7.cd by a party-line phI. 
Republican Senator Jim Ellis 
from EI Cajon saId the speedup 
will create a cash flov.. problem 
for small businesses. 

AdditIonally, " ten s of 
thousands of mall busine se 
don't know about (the bill) and 
won't know about it unlJl 
they're handed notices telling 
them to pay their taxes early," 
Elli . contended. 

Respondmg to Repu hlican 
charge that the revenue 
acceleration amounts to a tax 
increase, enator Rose Ann 
Vuich. D-Dinuba, saId "I can't 
understand how you can call it 
a tax increase. It' - money that 
belongs to t he government 
which is deducted from 
paychecks .... It 's not a tax 
incre~~e in any <;hape or 
form.

Treatment available for sports injuries 
Students need not be 'jocks' to get good medical help for aches and pains of sports 

By KATHY FINE 
UCSD tudents need not be 

jocks to be treated for ports-
related injuries. All students 
are eligible for help in the 
training room, the sport 
medicine cl inic and the 
rehabi litation lab - in that 
order, on the basi of referral. 

"The field of spo rt s 
medicine today i involved 
with the care of high level 
athletes , but the need of the 
country is to learn about high 
school level and intramural 
athlete ,," said Dale Daniel 
M.D., head of the Monday 
sports medicine clinic at the 
student health center. 

He ~tres ed that exercise 
and sports should b looked 
upon as "a lifelong part of our 
life, important not only to high 
level athletes." 

The difference in treating 
the professional athlete , 
according to Daniel , is that 
there is "more thrust on how 
fast he return to play - with 
some risk on the management 
of hi care." 

The recreational athlete can 
take up another sport. 

"You can't tell a San Diego 
Charger thi s i 'n't good, whX 
don't you take up bicycling? ' 
Daniel said. 

Though the training room 
primarily hosts intercoll giate 
athlete, Rhys Danylyshyn-
Adams, athlet ic trainer, is 
available for emergency care of 
people who are not involved in 
intercollegiate athletics. If he 
can't help them himself, he 
can refer them to someone that 
can. 

Only Danylyshyn-Adams ' 
signature will put a once 
injured player back in the 
game. He uses ten years of 
experience to tell if they are 
ready . 

"The philosophy here is to 
rest. not to get in right away. [ 
am here to monitor the 
a thlete's condition. r try todeal

"This is nol ju"t an injury

said.

must decide wh ther it is 
necessary to seek profe~ , ional 
help.

Danylyshyn-Adams. 

"A dip in the ocean after a 
game is better than a jacuzzi 
because the temperat ure of th 
jacuzzi i high and may cause 
internal bleeding if there is an 
injury or it will make your 
muscles . tiff and sore the next 
day," Danyly hyn·Adams 
said, 

Proper conditioning for the 
particular sport is the best 
prevention of injury. Different 
activities. require various 
ranges of flexibility and 
strength. 

"Every runner knows the) 
must rlln a minimum of rift" 
mile a week to prepare for a 
marathon, but omeone mav

Danylyshyn·Adamc; sug-

sees many injuries due to

calling that their warm up.

Joint position is guided hy 
muscle control. Mu 'cle con trol 
weaken with fatigue. As th 
mu 'cle fatigues, more stress is 
pIa 'ed on the ligament. This 
may lead to ligament failure, 
according to Daniel. 

Symptoms of a torn 
ligament are a knee that 
wobble fromsideto ide, can't 
be st raightened out, or bear 
any weight. The bone may be 
broken if there is also bleeding 
or brui ing in the area. If the 
limb is cold, blue and numb, 
ncar-by nerves or arteries may 
ha \Ie b e n damaged, A 
phy:ician should be' seen in all 
such cases.

Salary scales for 
some profs hiked 

pecial salary scales for 
faculty in University of 
California choo l of 
engineering and management 
will he before UC Regents for 
approval at their meetings 
today and tomorrow. 

"The s pecial scales are 
necessitated by perva ive 
problems in recruiting and 
retaining outs tanding faculty 
in the e fields ." said Archie 
Kleingartner. UC vic e 
pres ident for academic and 
taff per onne!. Survey 

recently conducted show that 
UC facul t y salarie in 
management lag 14 percent or 
more behind leading schools of 
business admin istration and 
management, and that UC 
alarie in engineering lag by 

some 13 to 15 percent. The e 
survey findings are included in 
the material being presented 
to Regents for action. 

Kleingartner has said that 
adopt ion of these higher, 
special scales will make UC 
sa laries competitive with 
' alaries paid at other 
universitie , but that a seriou 
problem will s till remain with 
regard to industry . "Engineer-
ing graduates with a 
baccalaureate degree are being 
offered salaries in industry 
that are comparable to what 
the new scale will provide for 
assistant professors," he said . 
"Many of our best students, 

whom we encourage to pursue 
advanced degrees in order to 
become faculty members 
thems Ive ,are lured away by 
salary offers from indus try 
that are immediate. We 
encounter the ame problem in 
management at the master's 
level. .. 

Inten ifying the need to 
recruit and retain out tanding 
faculty is high s tudent and 
societa l demand for degrees in 
engineering and bus ines . "In 
engineering, the problem i 
particularly c ritical," 
Kleingartn r aid . "Many 
more students want to become 
engineers than our facilities 
can accommodate, and 

ociety' need for engineers i 
greater than all the colleges 
and univers ities in thi nation 
can supply. We mus t have a 
faculty of the very highest 
quality if we are to met our 
obligation in attempting to 
s ati sfy these needs_" 

The new scales. if approved, 
would pay $24,500 to an 
assistant professor at the first 

tep. On t he regular salary 
scale the comparable figure i 
$19.700. At the associate 
professor level , the figures are 
$32 ,500 and $24 ,500; and at 
professor, $37,00 and 30,100. 
The top tep for a profes or 
currently pay $51,500; on the 
new cale the top tep would 
pay $56,700.

Andrew Keeler, ruts Editor The Arts 
Concert offers to 
bury the Hatchet 
Molly Hatchet and friends offer very 
little musical creativeness in concert 

BY ANDREW KEELER 
Arts Ed'itor 

In the land of rock and roll, it 
is usually the ca e that morc i 
less. Tuesday night 's concert 
at t he Sports Arena featuring 
Molly Hatchet and two other 
band did nothing to dispel 
thi notion. More guitar, 
more whistles, more chords , 
more "how ya doin 's" and 
more bright lights. Anything 
but more entertainmen t. 

The Henry Paul Band 
performed before Molly 
Hatchet, and an unsuspecting 
concertgoer wou Id have 
trouble di s tinguishing one 
from the other. Both feature 
three guitarists, both are from 
Florida and both dress and 
ound alike. The only 

difference is Hatchet' s lead 
s inger. Jimmy Farrar , who 
resembles a healthy 747. 

Paul wa a prominent 
member of the Outlaw until 
his departure two years ago to 
form his own band . There are 
heavy traces of the Outlaws in 
his work which make it 
difficult for t he band to find an 
identity . much the same as 
when Joe Perry left Aerosmith 
to form hi s own group. 

In an otherwise dreary set . 
the Henry Paul Band managed 
to alvage two songs, a tribute 
to Lynyrd Skynyrd and their 
catch y new si ngle "Hollywood 

Paradise." 
Molly Hatchet appeared in 

San Diego twice before as the 
warm-up act for t he Outlaws. 
It appeared they had found 
their niche a a econd-billed 
outfit emu lating the outhern 
s uperstars , but 'omewhere 
along the line they decided 
they wanted to share the 
pede tal that was vacated by 
predecessors Lynyrd Skynyrd 
and the Allman Brothers . 

It Tue day night 's turnout 
was any indication , they're not 
quite ready for the big s tep. A 
. parsely filled arena watched 
a s Molly Hatchet appeared to 
the sound of man -made 
thunder and electri c al 
lightning . The crowd 
responded by standing and 
screaming throughout the 90 
minute et. As usual the arena 
wa a giant echo chamber, 
making it virtually impo ible 
to comprehend any of the 
lyrics or frequent guitar solos . 
They mixed up their song list 
well, drawing on number 
from all four of their album '. 
As expected they leaned 
toward material off their new 
record Take No Prisollers. but 
their best playing came on old 
favorite, "Flirtin' with 
Disaster," "Beating the Odd s"

Fans of predictable rock 
concerts were not disappoint-

ice pouring over the stage , the 
open -mou t h gui tar po e. 
aircraft lights at the base of 
the drum ki t. and a thousand 
times "We love you San

Overall Molly Hatchet is

these two hortcomings are 
not fully realized unt ilthe film

Worthy of particular note in 
this picture i Dreyfu ' 
brilliant delivery of Clark's

the humor needs to fit his 
tragic situation. 

The entire concept of a 
movie based on the confined 
life of a quadraplegic i a brave 
one. One could as ume that 
liberties could have been taken 
by the writers and editors of 
the film in constructing a story 
that would maximi ze 
emotional appeal and diyert 
attention from the painful 
reality of living as a 
quadraplegic. 

Though . as was mentioned. 
Drey fu ss' though t process 

leading to his decision to die is 
not sufficiently explored, the 
effects of his d i ion on the 
lives of those around him are 
chronicled nicely. There are no 
surpri 'es, here. however. 
Given each character's 
persona as established early in 
the film, it is not di fficu lt to 
anticipate who will have what 
reaction to Dreyfuss' deci ion. 

One humorous note: as the 
picture for Dreyfuss becomes

Tritons collapse in overtinte 
BY BOB MCSP A DDEN 

Senior toff Writer 
Tue day evening' varsity 

basketball showdown between 
the powerful Point Lorna 
College Cru ader and the 
unpredictable UCSD Triton 
looked more like three games 
I han one. The con test's final 
,core: Poin t Lorna 86, UCSD 
77. 

In part one of the scenario. 
host UC San Diego fought 
back from a six point deficit to 
take a halftime advantage of 
eight points, 40-32. Senior 
guard Tom Wight laid in 12 
points in the fi rst twenty 

minutes of play for the 
Triton . The aggressive play 
of teammate Bob Goodman 
helped UCS D control the ball. 

The Triton's fir t lead came 
on a three poi nt play by reserve 
guard Don McC ullough. A 
player who ha seen 
infrequent action thus far in 
the ea on but who showed 
coach John Block t hat "he can 
handle the ball. " 

In the second half, alia 
"game number two," UCSD 
'aw its eight point lead build to 
fourteen. and then vanish. 
With nearly ten minutes left in 
regulation play the Triton 

.' 

went into a four corner stall, 
which shaved three minutes 
off the clock and gave Wight 
and center Mike Daba inskas 
a breather. Then the trouble 
started. 

Point Lorna center Don 
Bicket put on a spectacular 82 
second show when he twice 
stole the ball. once driving the 
length of the court to tuff in 
two points and then feeding to 
teammate Chester Hood for an 
ea y lay in.

In the past few years, the University of 

California has moved toward greater 
assignment of responsibilities to campuses for 
the operation of University programs on the 
presumption that those closest to the programs 
are best able to resolve issuesarising from their 
operation. The President and Systemwide 
Administration are responsible for policy and for 
assuring The Regents and the public that a ll 
programs and activities are appropriately 
supported and reviewed 

To strengthen the foundations of the 
stewardship of campuses. the President in 1979 
appointed three advisory committees to visit 
the campuses and report to him regularly on 
the state of the campuses. 

On February 11-12, Campus Advisory 
Committee "C" will visit UCSD. If you would be

Crusaders crucify Women 
BY JIM SCHUTZ 

Staff Write r 
A typical scene: after 

jogging onto the court for the 
econd half and loos ning up a 

litlle, the team u ually gathers 
arou nd the coach and shows 
their intensity by a hand pile 
and an inspirational "rah!" 

ot the Poi nt Lorna 
Women 's ba ' ketball team. 
After the second half and after 
each time out, they wou Id 
gather around the coach and 
yell "ball control" or "total 

team effort" ur even 
"intense." This is really 
college ports at it s best. The 
pro's u, ually circle and say the 
eternal "0" standing for 
Defen. e, while most of the 
rookies say "Me," meaning 
" .. . give me t he vall. I want to 
make a million bucks a year." 
Maybe the Lady Tritons 
should convert to something 
intelligent like "winning is 
everything; losing, nothing."

Hood laid in the tying points to 

send the game into overtime. 
The final ection of 

Tuesday evening's match wa 
nothing les than one- ided. 
"We played bad," commented 
Block. Point Lorna played 
incredible. In the five minute 
o ertime the Crusaders 
ouLcored UCSD 24-15, hit 
seven of seven 'hots from the 
floor and dropped in another 
eight for eleven from the foul

Point Lorna Crusaders . UCSD 
is now 4-12 . Point Lorna was 
led by Brenda Samuelson who 
topped all scorer with 24 
points and ga th rd . ix

Tritons own knight in shining 
armor (wi t h her met al gloves

UCSD" Intramural Floor 
Hockey last Monday night saw 
Floor Waaacks defeat Ganja 
Warriors 5-0 in AAA action. 

The first period , and nearly 
all of the second, passed 
without a score byeither team. 
Then, Floor Waaack ' Mike 
.(Leggs) Fiszer got one past the 

were a di appointed that we 
went right out and practiced 
for an hour and a half," said 
Fiszer. 

Floor Waaacks al 0 play 
together in occer and 
basket ball, but the team is 
most successfu l in floor 
hockey . 

"We got it together towards 
the end," said Fiszer of the 
team' s victory over the 
Warrior, 

Ne. I week they will hope to 
do the 'a rne when they take on 
Nail 's Raider '. 

Other floor hockey action on 
Monda y night had Nail' s 
Raiders defeated by Manches-
ter Puck Unlimited 8- 1, Risc 
over the Frozen Pucks 8-1, and 
Puck Me in the Car over the

what would be the start of a 
long final period for the 
Warriors. 

With an aggres ive style of 
play resembling that of the 
Philadelphia Flyers, the 
Warriors made numerous 
shots on goal, but were unable 
to penetrate the outstanding 
defense of Floor Waaack s 
goalie Bob Darroch, 

Intercollegiate sports schedule 

This is Floor Waaacks' third 
straight season together, they 
won A divi. ion two years ago, 
and AA division last yea r. 
Their only loss ever carne last 
week when they were defeated 
by la t yea r 's AAA champs 
Sombre Reptiles, 3-0. 

"After last week' game we

Bill Morgan's swim teams 

have also upgraded their 
schedules. "We want to swim 
against the type of competition 
we'll face at the National 
Championships," and by 
cheduling teams like Div. 1 

SDSU and University of 
Nevada , Las Vegas, Div. II 
UCR and Chico (ranked 
second), and the better Div. JII 
schools such as Claremont and 
Pomona-Pitzer (ranked third 

and first, respectively), 
Morgan's teams have done 
just that. "In past years there 
was maybe one or two of those 
kind of schools on our 
schedule," the coach explain, 
"so we've seen quite a change 
in competition." 

Coach Dennis Harper of 
men's water polo says that the 
team "used to have trou ble in 
matches with schools like 
Claremont and Whittier; no 
longer are these competitive 

games . We've left them 
behind." Last ea on his team 
played Pepperdine, UCSB, No. 
3 UC Berkley, No. 2 Long 
Beach State, and No, 1 
Stanford. (Again t Stanford, 
UCSD came up only three 
goals short, the mallest 
victory margin for Stanford' 
until they beat Long Beach 
State by two goals.) 

Clearly , Harper ha s 
emphasized the upgradlllg of 
the chedu le. "In the UCI 

tourney this season, we played 
more top level teams in two 
and a half days than we had in 
the previous 14 year ." The 
national rankings showed 
this. Of the top 15 ranked 
team in the country, only one 
was not a Div, I school that 
offer athletic cholar hip .

team to crack the top 10. The

Is there a 'golden age' of sports 
developing in intercollegiates ?

student interest in the 
program." The hope i · that

Intercollegiate sports 
schedule is growing 

the very succes ful team 
bowling. 

The Rec club situation is 
even better than the 
Intramurals. Any group who 
ha an intere ·t in any type of 
recreational activity can 
become a rec club by filing a 
constitution and electing 
members. The facility 
situation for new clubs is 
u pect though, as Mark 

Gonzalez, the head of the Rec 
club said, "new club usually 
don't get the good fields until 
they have proved they will be 
around for awhile." 

When talking about future 
plans forthe expan ion of staff 
Kobayashi stated that the 
department is a lm ost 
com plete. " I have a Rec 

Kobayashi said that becau eof 
the tight economy, "we must 
program more creatively," 
This means cutting corner 
but hopefully the end result 
will not be affected. Other 
ways the department hopes to 
make money is by holding 
intercollegiate summer port 
camps and to spon or events in 
the summer like a giant cooed 
soft ball tournament. 

The 1M department can 
usually get sponsor like 
Budwei 'er and Miller Beer for 
their specia l events but for the 
regular 1M program it is tough . 
The 1M department ha -. 
however. received -upport 
from the Reg fee committee. 
Hipp said. "Reg fee has been 
good to the department. The 

upportive of 1M's. 

The question was put, "Js 
this a new era in sports at 
UC O?" In the Recreat ion 
department it is an continua-
tion of an era started a few 
year back when attitudes and 
philosophie towards athletics 
changed. Is it a golden age? No. 

ntil UC D gets the facilities, 
like the new pool and a new 
gym, and the money to support 
programs for the 'c facilities, a 
gold n age will not exist. Even 
in the current situation, if 
philosophies do not change. it 
will bequilesometimeforthis 
age to appear, 

continued from page 17 
NCAA tournament, which 
takes the top eight teams. 
That's Harper' goal next 
year. and since a team that 
plays top 10 tea'ms instead of 
lC' all the time has a better 
chance for recognition, his 
team has a . good shot at 
makirig that goal. 

upervi or po ition that is a 
top level job unfilled. I would 
like to :plit Ihat po ition into 
two lower position -. " If he did 
that Kobayashi fe Is he will 
have everyone he needs and 
the department will be able to 
handle expansion for the next 
15 year. The only future 
employee increase would be 
clerks and Kobaya hi hope 
that Reg fee would agree to 
have students u 'ed. 

Tritons set back 

Doug Dannevik, women's 
volleyball coach, has done an 
equally good job of upgrading 
his team's schedule. "This 
team used to play mostly]C's 
and local schools. They played 
no four-year univer hies, and 
played in no tournaments . 
Now the team plays nationally 
ranked team and plays in a lot 
')f tourneys. especially near 
.he beginning of the season . 
These tournaments give the 
athletes more playing time, 
and often provide very good 
competition. What 's more, 
they're fun (or the athletes to 
play in, and that gets them 
motivated. " 

The mo t recent addition to 
the staff ha been an arti t. 
The artist was hired to do 
graphic and handle the 
promotion for the Rec 
department. The department 
ha decided to become much 
more vi ible which explains 
the need for good promotion.

for Wight and Goodman and 
five assists for Flaig. UCSD 
also got good help from the 
bench, with reserves Beach 
and McCullough addinga total 
of ] 8 points to the cause. 

Thi Saturday's billing for

Triton with Fre -no Pacific

Tuesday UCSD will travel to 
Azusa Pacific College, a team 
which lost by only one point to 
nationally top notched Bida 
College. The trend of the 
season could likely be sel with 
the -e two games. 

Dannevik also explains why 
better scheduling is impor-
tant. "First, by playing 
nationally ranked teams we 
can attract attention to our 
program and can recruit better 
student-athletes here. Second, 
in better competition the team 
faces bigger challenges; the 
team might let down against 
easy teams, but it won't 
again t the better ones.

tougher team play us at

Again t SDSU, for in tance, 
we had over 1000 fan s 
cheering us on. 

"The e are three definite 
advantages of tougher 
scheduling, and though 
perhaps our won-lost record 
will suffer, the bettering of the 
program i what's most 
im portant." 

As UCSO' teams become 
more successful and prove 
themselves more competitive, 
they are able to attract the 
larger, more competi ti ve 
school s onto their schedule. 
This gives the school greater 
recognition , which attracts 
better athletes, which leads to 
even more competitive teams, 
and the process snowballs. 
THe tougher schedules of 
UCSD's teams can only help in 
the long run. 

In the areas of coaching, 
recruiting, and scheduling, 
UCSD's intercollegiate teams 
have definitely begun a new 
traditin of competitivenes and 
winning . This has all 
happened despite the minimal 
funds, especially for coaching 
salaries. If this sports 
tradition is to continue, 
however, the funding shall 
have to increase to acceptable 
levels . When thi happens, it 
will complete a transition into 
a new era of intercollegiate 
sports.
