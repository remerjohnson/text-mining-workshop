Senior Staff Writer 

As part of a West Coast road trip, President 
Clinton visited a San Diego-area Charter School 
last Friday, delivering a half-hour speech on 
education. 

Standing at the podium in front of a 2,000-
plus crowd at O'Farrell Community School, 
Clinton stressed the importance of federally 
funding public elementary schools, secondary 
schools and universities. 

Clinton also blasted recent efforts by Re-
publicans to cut federal funding to public 
schools and universities across the nation. 

"Don't let anyone convince you that fed-
eral funds cannot be well spent on publics edu-
cation. And don't you let anyone convince you 
that we have to cut out this money to balance 
the federal budget," Clinton said. 

He also said that efforts to reduce the na-
tional deficit should not compromise the qual-
ity of education.

More Than 2,000 Gather at Hump for Year's First TG 
REGGAE: Pato Banton 
and free beer credited 
for large turnout 
By Cia,. Zimmerman 
Staff Writer 

Boasting headliner Pato Banton 
and the Reggae Revolution and 
offering free beer for the first time 
since 1989, the Associated Stu-
dents (A.S.) held its first TGIF 
(TG) event of the year last Friday. 

"We've been working on this 

[event] all summer," A.S. Assis-
tant Programmer Jeff Krauss said. 
"It's important to have campus 
unity and for everybody to have a 
good time." 

More than 2,000 students 
crowded around the Hump, located 
in front of the Main Gym, to listen 
to opener Liquid Groove and the 
lead band Pato Banton. " 

In an enclosed area adjacent to 
the Hump, an outside distributor 
- hired by the A.S. - passed out 
eight kegs worth of free beer to 

students 21 and older. 
Six UCSD police officers, 21 

Staff Pro employees and nine Cam-
pus Protective Assistants worked 
the event. 

"I've had good experiences with 
TGs in the past, so I decided to 
come here tonight," Revelle fifth-
year student Marin Judd said, as 
she waited in the line outside the 
fenced-in beer garden.

The "glove

"We can't balance our budget by

The president then addressed

cation in California. 

"California has seen what hap-
pens when you cut back on the 
availability of people who can go 
to college. You have a declined 
enrollment in your colleges and an 
increased cost," he said. "I want to 
lower the cost and increase the 
enrollment in our colleges."

AFFIRMATIVE 
ACTION WOULD 
RIGHT WRONGS 
OF OUR RACIST 

PAST 
By Kathleen Lytle, 

Contributing Opinion Writer 
A1f1lll1ative action is a tool this nation has used to com-

bat the vicious residues of slavery and Jim Crow laws. 
Born out of the Civil Rights Movement, affinnative 

action ~as driven by a three-centurYoQld struggle 
waged by blacks and whites for racial justice. 

Some argue that affirmative action has run 
its course. These people claim that it has already 

helped underrepresented groups overcome ob-
stacles. They point to white women's ascendence 

to power in the 1970s and 198Os. Oppressed in the 
past, white women have benefited greatly from affir-

mative-acti.on policies. They have achieved almost equal 
numbers in colleges and universities and bave gained ac-
cess to professions which previously discouraged their en-
trance. And though they have not reached equality of ac· 
cess, opportunity and promotion, these arguers state that 
women have nonetheless made significant strides. They 
attribute the progress of white women in the job market 
to affirmative action. 

However, it is likely that white women would have 
made similar advancements without it. White women be. 
gan to experience changes in gender roles as the Ameri-
can economy became less stable during the last few de-
cades. Beginning as early as 1945,the United States started 
to experience the end of an unprecedented economic 

boom. By 1973, inflation and unemployment increlsed 
tremendously. This was coupled with what Harvard 

Professor Cornel West cites in Prophetic Thought in 
Postmoderll T~.r as "regressive taxation [whicb 

moved] from a 70-percent bracket for top elnlCfS down 
to 28 percent." And u it became nCCCllU)' for both adults 
in a family to work to maintain middJe-c11lSl status, fe-
male workers became more acceptable. The middle ellII 
became Iell stable uru:Ier- ~aganomics, and remale pr0-
fessionals became necessary. The opening of the job mar-

front and top of the box - allow a color 
video camera to record the experiments. 
The picture is then relayed to Williams and 
the research team monitoring the box from 
the NASA Space Flight Center in Hunts-
ville, Alabam •. 

Although the primary purpose of the ex-
periments is to gain an understanding of the 
fundamenJal properties of flames, Williams 
said that there are many practical applications 
of sum knowledge. 

"We will be burning fossil fuels for many 
years to come," he said. "And it is becom-
ing increasingly clear that, with less and 
less of it in the future, we will need to learn 
how to bum it more efficiently, cleaner and 
safer." 

Twenty years of research by Williams and 
other scientists have laid the foundation for 

tbeee experiments in space. AltbouJll Wlll-
ilDll hal known for more tbIn a year that tbe 
shuttle experimcnta were planned. be Aid "it 
is somehow much more exciting when it is 
actually going to h.ppen." 

Williams. however, will not be attending 
the I.unch of the shuttle becaulIC of scbcduling 
problems. 

"I've got things I've got to do [during the 
launch]," he said. "I'll just be in Huntsville." 

Baili Zhang, Williams' graduate-student 
851istant, did many of the calculations neccs-
sary to compare theoretical predictions with 
the experimental results. " 

When asked jf Ibis experiment was a cul-
mination to Williams' yearsofrcscarch work, 
Zbangsaid, "It's not over. It's never over. It's 
a lot of wort, but It's really worth it." 

Williams agreed that these experiments are 
only "one more step" in the continued studies 
offuel combustion. He added that the experi-
ments will lay the framework for larger-scale 
experiments scheduled to be performed on 
another shuttle expedition, slated for launch in 
April 1997.

CONCERT: 
A.S. rekindles 
UCSD tradition 
ContInued froIn .,... 1 
come sec it," said Revelle senior Dominique 
Cutts. 

After the TG, organizers said they were 
pleased with the event. 

"It was -an all-around success," Krauss 
said. "This year's events will more than make 
up for last year's less-than-adequate pro-
gramming. " 

Friday's concert marked the first time in 
almost six years that beer had been served at 
aTG. 

According to programming officials, the 
tradition of frcc Friday concerts at UCSD 
originated in the early 70s. In previous years, 
TOs took place in the afternoon, and the 
distribution of beer was lightly monitored. " 

Beer distribution at TGs was eventually 
discontinued in 1989 because regulations of 
the Alcoholic Beverage Control and the En-
vironmental Health and Safety Department 
were not being followed, UCSD administra-
tors said. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Af-
fairs Tommy Tucker said that in addition to 

The UCSD Ouardian 

"We worked with the A.S. to sort out the 
detaila because we want to support student 
activities. The focus of the event is not alco-
hoi," Tucker added. 

"The A.S. was forced to stop serving 
.Icohol in 1989 because they were doing it 
iIIeg.lly .... They had students checking IDs 
.nd serving the beer, and the beer wasn't kept 
in an enclosed area," Krauss said. 

"We hired outside professionals to deal 
with the alcohol for us," he added. "Every-
thing is legal now." "

EdItor: 
I miSlied not reading the Guard-

ian over the summer break, and I 
was glad to see your first issue of 
the new year. I bope that as the staff 
gets organized and settles into its 
job, the news and commentary writ-
ingwill ~OR\e more balanced. The 
coverage of tbe regents' vote on af-
firmative action was utterly one-
sided, though the debate before and 
during the regents' meeting clearly 
was not. 

This was the most important 
news story of the year - perbaps 
tbe most important in many years 
- affecting the UC system. The 
Guardian's coverage was transpar-
ently partisan and, even worse, shal-
low. There was no explanation of 
the issues that led to the vote, nor 
of the reasons bebind support for the 
action. The story bad the tone of a 

DECISION: 
Continued from PC- 4 
tive action is still in its primary 
stages of implementation. Given 
years to correct injustices and equal-
ize biring and admission practices, 
affirmative action could put a seri-
ous dent in the repressive policies 
of the past wbicb still linger today. 
Affirmative action lias had positive 
effects in broadening the black 
middle class, but bas yet to bave 
enough time to stabilize a black 
middle- and upper-class income and 
ownersbip economy. Mfirrnative 
action must not only break the bar-
riers to blacks being promoted 
within white organizations and com-

featuJe article, a polnt4-view piece 
written from the camp of the di ... 
senters, ratber than about the event 
at larse. 

For a campus without a joumal-

a very respectable job over the years 
tbat I bave read it. Best wishes for 
tbe year ahead.

Editor: 

I could not believe my eyes when 
Iread Kathleen 4t1e'scommentary 
("Blasting tbe Bible-Thumping 
Buffoons," Sept. 19, 1995). How is 
it that those on the political left can 

~t away with calling Clristian con-
servatives "Bible-Thumping Buf-
foons"? If a conservative carne out 
and called Willie Brown and Jesse 
Jackson "Race-Baiting Gorillas," 
there would be an uproar sucb as the 

panies, but must also facilitate the 
growth of businesses whicb African 
Americans own. 

aearly, the issues of alI'mnative-
action policies do not solely affect 
black Americans. It is the strained 
relationsbip between black and 
wbite Americans whicb gave impe-
tus to affirmative action's imple-
mentation. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. addressed the issue of tenst black 
and white relations in the searcb for 
justice in his book, WIly ~ Can~

agree; but be should ask for nothing 
more. On the surface, this appears 
reasonable, but it is not realistic. For 
it is obvious that if a man entered at 
the starting line in a race 300 years 
after another man, tbe first would 
bave to perform some impossible 
feat in order to catcb up with bis fel-
low runner." 

Dr. King prophetically addressed 
the contemporary arguments sur-
rounding affinnative action in Why 

~ Can't Wait. As educated people, 
we should be careful to DOt randomly 
cite popular lines, sucb as "content 
of our cbaracter," without examin-
ing their true context and meaning. 
Gov. Pete Wilson made this mistake 
at the UC resents' meeting last SIIID-

TiIrt~s for weeka, and Catberine 
MacKinnon would no doubt be agi-
tating for more curbs on "bate-
speecb." 

One of the fallacies tbat really 
jumped out at me aa I read the piece 
was4tle's assertion that wbatgoes 
on bebind closed doors is "none of 
our business." The claim tbat "We 
'" do not bave the right to control 
private lives" is absolutely ludi-
crous. Certainly, child pornogra-
phers do wbat tbey do in private. 
Drug kingpins certainly conspire 
bebind closed doors to distribute 
their poison on our streets. Do we 
not bave tbe right to probibit such 
activity? 

In addition, it is very offensive 
to see Christianity derided merely 
as a system of prejudices. 4t1e 
seems to know very little about tbe 
bistoric Cbristian faitb. And if 
Christianity is merely a system of 
prejudice and oppression, wbat can 
be said for Lytle's ultra-radical 

mer when be sought to repeal affir-
mative-action policies witbin the 
UC system. Wilson distorted the 
words of a great man to support a 
political game-be is playing witb 
awkward race relations in America. 

Those wbo wish to agree witb 
Wilson that aff'mnative-action poli-
cies are a type of "reverse discrimi-
nation" simply do no know what 
discrimination is and are possibly 
coofused by the semantics of an is-
sue rooted in American bistory. If 
African Americans only bad to 
struggle against independent and 
unrelated cases of disaiminatiOll, 
they would bave no struggle and 
they would bave ac::bieved justice in 
its most realistic form. One wbo

views? What is more curious II bow 
t.,tJe refrains from cbutialng the 
Christian Left for trying to prop up 
its own political views uaing the 
Scripture. 

I am not an apologist for mucb 
of wbat tbe Christian Coalition 
stands for, and I do not believe in 
marketing Christianity as a politi-
cal movement. But it is really sad 
wben people like Lytle attack 
Christianity as if it were a political 
agenda. 

For the past few years in which 
they bave been politically influen-
tial, the Christian Right and Chris-
tian Coalition bave championed 
the causes of fiscal responsibility, 
traditional values and limited gov-
ernment. The American public bas 
no reason to fear conservative 
Christians unless, of course, they 
subscribe to the ultra-liberal, big-
government ideals of leftists like 
Lytle.

Fire Department Frees 23 :from Jammed Elevator 
TRAPPED: Students 
compare situation to 
scene in movie Speed 
By Terry Lew 
Associate foWMs Editor 

The smaller ofTioga Hall 's two 
elevators became home to 23 people 
for an hour on MondllY night, when 
the overloaded car shut down be-
tween the fifth and sixth Ooors. 

The elevator, approximately 
seven-feet wide and four-feet deep 
- with a maximum capacity of 
2,500 pounds - broke down at 
11:30 p.m. The San Diego Fire De-
partment freed the students roughly 
an hour later. 

"We got in the elevator, we 
p-essed the button, it went up, and 
then it just stopped," said Revelle 
freshman Christian Schraeder. 

Maintenance worker Jerry 
Nakagawa of UCSD Housing and 
Dining Services said that the eleva-
tors have numerous built·in safety' 
devices. 

"If you overload or rock an el· 
evator, it'll trip-out and shut -down, " 
be said. 

Maintenance workers can nor-
mally reset an overloaded elevator 
and open the doors, but the doors 
were damased when the people in· 
side attempted to free themselves. 

"Once [the elevator] shut down, 
they dido't know what went wrong 
with it, so they started prying the 
door open," Nakagawa said. 

As other students forced the outer 
doors apart, the elevator dropped be" 
tween two and three feet. No one was 
injured,aItbougblmunidcntifJedfitsb· 
man vomited and passed ouL He reo 
rovered and left the soene without 

aailllDoe from JB'amediCL 
Muir Collese Aaailltant Resident 

Dean Kathie Pof( streued that in 
calle of an emergency, students 
should use the elevator intercom to 
call for help instead of attempting 
the pry open the doors themselves. 

"We would have bad [the stu· 
dents] out so much quicker if they 
hadn't done anything," she said. 

"People oUght to know [better]," 
said Muir Residential Security Of· 
ficer Karl Hairston. "They're al-
ways in a hurry to get somewhere, 
and they wind up going nowhere." 

Several observers and people 
trapped inside rompared the situa· 
tion to the movie Speed, in which an 
elevator drops down a high·rise 
building. 

"/twas your basic elevator panic, 
movie.type scene, where 90 percent 
of the people were panicking and 

two of the people were trying to get 
out," said Roosevelt freshman 
Simon Oopton, who-was one of the 
students inside. 

"Ifeltfor them," said Muir fresh· 
man Steve BerJrus, who lives on the 
sixth floor of TIoga. "[ looked at 
their faces, and some o( them were 
really scared." 

Others downplayed the serious-
ness of the situation_ "It wasn't too 
bad," said Marshall frcshmanJonab 
NieliCDlIOD. "It was just a bundJ of 
people waiting to get out." . 

Copton agreed that while the 
situation was tolerable, he eventu· 
ally became impatient. "There was 
Ibe basic worry that we were go-
ing to. have to spend the night in 
Ibere, and [ was getting ... sick of 
spending the evening in a box with 
30 people." 

After waiting for the elevator 

technician, the Ore depealWent de-
cided to remove the doon. 

Mike Alritola, the General El-
evator aervice technician. was un-
able to repair the damaF despite 
working for over an hour. 

"This is the rll'Sl time the Ore 
department has tom the <loon off in 
the two years that I've been bere," 
be said. "h's destroyed." 

A similar incident occurred dur-
ing the summer of 1994 when 29 
girls living in TIOga Hall for a 
cheerJeading camp overloaded the 
small elevator. When they were fi-
nally freed, several had to be taken 
to the hospital. 

Muir Residential ute IItaff re-
spondtd to the incident by posting 
"Community Alert Bulletins" 
around the residence balls and apart-
ments, warning studeots not to overv 
load the elevators.

Petitions 
Congress 
NAMES: One mi1lion 
sign "Environmental 
Bill of Rights" 
By MIIt'J HI"ln. 
Guardian· Reporter 

A coalition led by CA12IRG 
(the California Student Public in-
terest Research Group) and the Si-
erra Club announced Sept. 21 that 
- in just six months - over one 
million u .S. citizens signed an en-
vironmental petition addressed to 
Newt Gingrich. 

More than 8,000 signatures were 
collected in San Diego alone, many 
by UCSD students. 

The five-point petition, entitled 
"An Environmental Bill of Rights," 
claims that "every American hili a 
right to a safe and healthy environ-
ment" and urges elected officials to 
take action to protect this right . 

The petition also includes the 
"E.tb Day 1995 Action Agenda," 
wbich makes 25 specific recommen-
datiooa for government action. 

wnhllttanendousou~uringof 
public support ••• sends a loud -
.. d clear - wake-up call to Con-
ge .... said Seth Tanner, CAlPIRG 
campaign director. ·Stop the roll-
bact of environmental laws and save 
our envirorunenl." 

The "Environmental Bill of 
Rigbts" mwlates pollution peven-
tion, the Jft8CrVadon of America's 
natural beril9. me discootinualion 
of gfvuways of public ..... the 
conservation of natura1 resources and 
Ibe end of interest-group politics. 

A CAlJIIRG Dyer circulating on 
campus a5llCrts that "corporate pol· 
luters wbo are willing to plunder our 
natural resources in the name of 
IYofil" are I_gely responsible for 
environmental degradation. 

CAl,J)IRG aACrts thaI because 
several special-interest groups have 
influenced politicians, people are 
being denied the right to a safe and 
healthy environment, 

"People should have the right to 
participate in the system, even if 
they don't have a lot of money," 
said Tom Qestodina, assistant di-
re,etor of the San Diego chapter of 
CAlJIIRG. 

By raising public awarc:ness, 
members of CAlPIRG said they 
aim to encourage government offi-
cials to take action against corpora-
tions that try to weaken pollution 
regulations, such as the Qean Wa-
ter Act of 1972. 

Supporters of the petition hope 
that the October delivery of the 
1,050,000 signatures will demon-
strate public concern over the con-
diUon of the environment. 

"These signatures are the largest 
number collected in a six·month 
period during any legislative cam· 
paign in the history of the environ-
mental movement," Tanner said. . 

Noel Aguilar,campusCAl2IRG 
director, said that be is optimistic 
about the level of student activism 
on campus, atd that circulating the 
petition was one way for students to 
voice their concern for the environ· 
ment.

nder the punishing blows of the 
San Diego Charger offense and 
staunch resistance of its defense, 
John Elway and the Denver 
Broncos found out the hard way 

that you can ' t win if you don' t have the baU. 
The Chargers scored only three limes yester-

day at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, but thai 
was' more than enough 10 soundly defeat the 
Broncos, 17-6: 

The Chargers ground attack dominated the 
game, totalling 159 yards. Perhaps more impor-
tantly, it kept the ball out ofElway 's hands. In the 
first quarter, the Broncos had the ball for less than 
five minutes. By game's end their time of posses-
sion amounted to a paltry 23:50. 

The combination of a tough San Diego defense 
and consistently poor field position spelled trouble 
for Elway and company, who only made 12 first 
downs all day. The Broncos' rushing game pro-
duced only two of those first downs and 29 yards. 

"It's tough to get a running game going when 
you're only in there three plays and then you 're 
out again. We didn' t convert any third downs," 
Elway said. 

Under pressure, the normally prolific Elway 
completed only 19 passes for 186 yards. Key 
receptions weren 't enough for the Broncos. San 
Diego guard Eric Moten praised his teammates' 
defensive efforts. 

"[The Broncos] completed the passes but they 
didn 't get a chance to really run with it," he said. 

Linebacker Junior Seau and safety Rodney 

Harrison combined to tackle Denver receivers on 
third-down completions (shy of the first-down 
marker) three times. Seau racked up ten tackles, 
leading the Chargers in that category for the first 
time this season. 

The Chargers' defensive line, though record-
ing only one sack, controlled the line of scrim-
mage all day. 

"Our philosophy is you're gonna have to double 
team us all. You can ' t leave one ofus alone," said 
tackle Shawn Lee. "Elway 's a hell of a QB, 

. scrambles well, gets down the field well. We 
knew that we had to k~ep him in the pocket in 
order for us to win the game, and that 's what we 
did. We kept him in the pocket and we came up 
with a 'W'." 

The only shortcoming of the Chargers' defense 
was not forcing any turnovers. Said quarterback 
Stan Humphries: "The way the defense is playing 
right now, you've just got to be able to run the 
football, control the clock, score some points, and 
don 't make the silly mistakes that give their of-
fense a short distance to go. " 

The Chargers' lone turnover was a Humphries 
interception deep in Denver territory. Thrown 
slightly behind wideout Mark Seay, the ball 
bounced off the receiver's hands and into line-
backer Elijah Alexander's waiting grasp. 

"I didn 't see Stan, 1 just saw the ball," said 
Seay, who finished the game with three catches 
for 36 yards. "I was trying to run with the ball 
before I had it."

ond half. It turned out 
to be the Broncos' lut 
score. 

Humpbries came 
alive during the Charg-
ers' last drive of tbe 
third quarter, making 
three completions on 
third down. He hit four 
of his receivers on the 
drive, including two 
first-down receptions 
to Tony Martin, who 
caught five catches for 
82 yards. But when it 
came time to score the 
six, Humphries again 
handed off to Means, 
who strolled untouched 
into the endzone from 
two yards out. 

Means rushed for 
over 100 yards for the 
third straight game, av-
eraging over four yards 
on 27 attempts. In ad-
dition to his first two 
1Ds of the season, he 
scampered for a 26-
yard gain in the first 
quarter.

The Broncos converted the pick 
into a 23-yard field goal, after driv-
ing 85 yards. The OIargers roared 

back with a 73-yard drive that ate up 
seven minutes on the clock. 

Running back Natrone Means 
carried the baU six times on the 
drive for 30 yards, capping tbe 
team's efforts with a thrce-yard run 
off the left end for a touchdown. 

The Charger defense then went 

to work, allowing the Broncos only 
two first downs in their next six 
possessions. Elway's vaunted two-
minute offense sputtered to end the 
half, u Shawn Lee and Leslie' 
O'Neal lliClted him for a loa on 
third down from Denver's own 28.

with him 'fUnning it behind us."

self-destructed on their fim drive of 
the fourth quarter, the CharBen 
killed more time off the clock. Four 
penalties OD four plays forced the 
Broncos to punt. The Chargers re-
sponded with a 5:46 drive and a 4S-
yard field goal by John Carney. 

Then it wu just a matter of wait-
ing for the clock to run out, u the 
Chargers held on for their third 
straight victory to go 3-1 and grab a 
share of the AFC West lead. 

Humphries finished 18 of 32 for 
189 passing yards. He bristled at 
criticism that the Chargers offense 
has stumbled. 

"We're popping off some good 
runs and we get some big plays in 
the passing game," Humphries said. 

"That 's what I like about this 
team," he added, in response to the 
first-quarter interception. "These 
guys are going to come back."

Tritons Oust Cal Duo to Remain Perfect 
STREAK INTACT: UCSD (7-0) extended its regular season undefeat~d streak to 42 by knocking off Cal Baptist and Cal Lu 
By Sean Rablml 
Associate Sports Editor 

And thebeatgoeson. The UCSD 
women's sbccer team extended its 
amazing streak of undefeated regu-

lar season games to 
42 last week with a 
pair of victories. 

The Tritons won 
a home game against 
California Baptist 
College on Wednes-
day, Sept. 21 by a 
score of 2-0. 

California Lutheran University 
was UCSD's opponent on Sunday, 
but the Tritons again came away 
victorious - this time by a 2-] tally 
on the Regals' home turf. 

Cal Lu was the last team to 
defeat the Tritons in regular sea-
son play, back on Oct. 9, 1992 by 
a score of 2-0. 

With the two wins, the Tritons 
raised their season record to a per-
fect 7-0. 

Sunday's war with the Regals' 
pitted a pair of proud undefeated 
teams, but by the end of the day only 
one remained, as UCSD prevailed, 
2-1. 

Midwa y through the first half, 
Triton senior standout Carin Pugh 
set up felJow forward Ele Johnson 
for the first UCSD goal and an early 
1-0 lead. The Tritons held on to the 
lead until halftime despite a vigor-
ous Cal Lu attack. 

"We dominated for the first 2.5 
minutes," UCSD Head Coach Brian 

McManus said. 
Early on in the 

second half, the score 
remained the same. 
However, the Regals 
evened things up 
when Holly Roepke 
scored at 73:05 to 
knot the contest at I-
I. 

"We played well 
for the first 10 min-
utes of the half, and 
for the rest of the 
half, it was back and 
forth," McManus 
said. "Cal Lu came 
on strong. It was a 
very tough game." 

The Tritons were 
not to be denied, 
though, and they 
stormed back eight 
minutes later on Ele 
Johnson ' s second 
goal o( the day at 
85:32. 

passed to an open Ele Johnson. 
Johnson promptly dribbled past one 
defender and headed toward the goal, 
creating a two-on-one situation, as a 
streaking Carin Pugh accompanied 
her from the left side. 

As Pugh broke toward the goal, 
Johnson drew the opposing 
goaltender towards her, and then 
dished off to an open Pugh, who :t 
fired into the empty net. 

The score remained the same 
going into the second half, as the 
Lady Lancers tried to even the score 
- but had no such luck. 

UCSD increased its lead to 2-0 at 
59:32 when1..auren Johnson 's cor-
ner kick was deflected by Ele 
Johnson in front of the California 
Baptist goal, and Senior Diana 
Muchowski buried the loose ball 
into the empty net. 

"We held in all right," 
Muchowski said. "I think we were 
looking ahead to the game against 
Cal Lutheran on Sunday and we 
didn't have our heads in tbis one."

Kick out of life: Lauren Johnson assisted on the Tritons second goal against 
California Baptist Wednesday afternoon. UCSD went on to win by a 2.0 tally. 

CSC hung in the game only be-
cause of the outstanding play of its 
goalie, Amelies Verhagen. 
Verhagen faced 10 shots and made 
seven saves while the Triton goalie 
tandem of Amanda Alban and Kelly 
Pearson did not face a single shot all 
day. 

the top of the [goalie] box," 
McManus said. "It was a tremen-
dous shot" 

After that goal, UCSD held on 
for dear life, as the Regals tried 
frantically to notch a tying score. 

"The last four minutes were hell," 
McManus said. 

The Triton defense did manage 
to prevent a Cal Lu comeback, al-

lowing their coach to speculate on 
the impgrtance of the ·win. 

"Thi~ was a big win for us that 
we really needed," McManus said. 
"This will probably be their only 
loss of the year. They will win their 
division. " 

Earlier in the week, the Tritons 
defeated California Baptist Colle,&e 
by a score of 2-0 at Triton Soccer' 

Stadium. From the start, this game 
was controlled by the speed of th~ 
home squad. UCSD's fast-paced 
games had possession of the ball for 
most of the game. 

After only 16 minutes of play, 
The Triton offense produced the first 
goal of the game to take a 1-0 lead.

down the right side of the field and

ColI. PolIce Blotter 
On to brighter topics, I call 

attention to the mess we call col· 
lege football. What's going on 
here? It seems u if everyday 
there is a new athlete pleading 
"no contest" to a rape, usault, 'or 
theft charge. Do these kida think 
they are in the pros already? 

For example, take the cue of 
Lawrence Phillips. A star run· 
ning back for Nebrulta, Phillips 
had sprinted to a mammoth head 
start on the Heisman field by 
racking up almost 400 yuels and 
seven TDs in the Huskers fint 
two, yes two, games. 

However, before he could jog 
down to the NY Athletic Club to 
accept his award, Phillips put in 
an application to the O.J. 
Simpson Heisman Alumni As· 
sociation by taking out some 
post·game aggression on his girl· 
friend. Apparently, Larry forgot 
that stiff·arming is barely legal 
on the field - let alone in the 
bedroom. He has since pleaded 
"no contest" and could he back 
on the field within a month. 

So, you uk, "Hey Cynic, how 
come you're happy to have f\lOt-
ball back? (tseems like asporto( 
violence and crime." 

What can 1 say? You're right. 
Football is a violent sport played 
by violent men who come to· 
gether every weekend and try to 
beat the hell out of each other. 

What more can you ask for?

DANCING: UCSD 
grooved past Biola, but 
settled for a tie with Cal Lu 
Continued from ..... 32 

Turner was the offensive star of the 
gamefor UCSD, u he tallied two goals and 
tacked on two usists. 

In addition, Turner 
added 1Ms- name to the 
"best dance" competition 
with an impressionistic 
"airplane" celebration 
'which saw him swooping 
around the field to Biola's 
dismay. 

Turner's second tally 
of the game came when 
he knocked a penalty 
kick past the helpless 
Eagle netminder, who 
had tackled him to draw 
the penalty. Following 
that score, Turner 
sprinted upfield with his 
shirt pulled over the top 
of his head. 

Other contributors for 
the Tritons were seniors 
Nick Terlecky and Erik 
Waldman. 

Atone poinl in the sec-
ond half, UCSD scored 
I hree goals in the span of 
a mere ten minutes. This 
oUlburst of offensive fury 
left Biola hopelessly oUI 
of the contest, Irailing 5-
O. 

"We're goingto bedif· 
ficult to beat lat home]," 
Armstrong said. "It's a 
good field and ii's nice to 
see a crowd. It's wonder-

'phere." 
The Tritona next conteat will be a face 

off againat Point Loma Nazarene at Triton 
Soccer Stadium this Wednesday at 3:30. 

If UCSD does u much dancing during 
this game, you can bet there will be a disap· 
pointed Pt. Loma squad on the other side of 
the ball.

Late Goal By Cal Lu Spoils UCSD's Right 
U .... WlNCI: UCSD (4-3-1) dominated Biola ~lIege, 6-0, on Wednesday and tied Cal Lutheran, 2-2, on Sunday evening 
By, .... R ... lmI 
Associate Sports Editor 

All in all, you could say it was 
a good week for the UCSO men's 
soccer team. The Tritons came 

back from a tough 
3-2 loss at Southern 
California College 
on VVednesday by 
crushing Biola Uni-
versity 6-0 two days 
later. UCSD then 
finished its week by 
-'~~~ earning a tie against 
arch-rival California Lutheran 
University on Sunday. 

UCSD returned from Cal Lu 
yesterday with a respectable 4-3-1 
record after fighting off the 
Kingsmen to gain a 2-2 tie. 

The Tritons jumped out to 1-0 
lead in the first half on a goal by 
Minh Nguyen at 24:30. At the 
54:01 mark of the second half, 
sophomore Chris Braga increased 
the lead to 2-0 with a goal assisted 

__ by Jose O'Campo. 
However, the Kingsmen were 

not without their offensive oppor-
tunities, and they soon fought back 
to tie the game at 2-2. 

midfielder Brian 
Turner that gave Cal 
Llitheran a man ad-
vantage for the last 
six-and-a-half min-
utes of regulation 
and all 30 minutes 
of overtime. 

But the Triton de-
fense played tough 
and held on for the 
2-2 tie. 

On Friday, Sept. 
22, UCSD returned 
home after a long 
road trip and de-
feated Biola Univer-
sity by a dominating 
6-0 score. The Tri-
tons were happy to 
be back home, and it 
showed. 

Cal Lu brought themselves 
within one goal witb a score at tbe 
65:18 mark and tied the game at 
two, wben Sebastian Alvarado 
sailed a free kick over a Triton 
wall of defenders and past goalie 
Jason Reynoso. 

The scoring fest 
started quickly 
when, after only 
three-and-a-half 
minutes of play, 
Turner broke free 
down the right side 
and crossed a per-
fect ball to Chris 
Fong, who beat the 
Biola goalkeeper for 
UCSO's first goal. 

Things only got ao.tnt: Brian Turner does his best impression of an airplane after staking UCSD to a 3-0 lead against Biola. 

The free kick was the result of 
a red card given to junior 

better, as Christopher Fuji stole a 
ball on the left side of the 18-yard 
box and dribbled forward just in 
time to nail a shot past the keeper 
for a two-goal lead. 

But Fuji Wls not done because 
he quickly raced over to the far 
corner flag pole and began a cel-
ebration dance he later dubbed the 
"Home Game Special." The "spe-

cial" was something along the lines 
of an NC-17 rated hula dance 
which caused even the corner pole 
to blush - and brought a confused 
core of fans to its feet. 

"VVecame out fired up tonight," 
Fuji said. "Being at home we had 
more enthusiasm and tbat's what 
we need to do in order to win."

Tritons Test Depth at UCR Invitational 
'lESnNG 1 • .2 •• 3: UCSD gave its '8' team the opportunity to show what it ~uld do at the smog-infested UC Riverside Invite 
last Saturday, and the squad performed admirably, as both the men and women bested their previous times 
By Dan KrIft 
Spotts Editor 

MDtt athletes trying to break 
into the starting ranks of a college 
team are forced to prove them-

conditions. 

selves to coaches 
and teammatea in 
practice. 

It is a rare occa-
sion when aspiring 
youngsters have the 
chance to show 
what they've got 
under competitive 

This past weekend, however, 

the UCSD CIOII CCMIIItry eqaad af-
forded tllatopportuaity to tile hard-
workiag I1II111Cn who lIIIke up ita 
'0' team. 

The Tritoa'i c:rcw of diltance 
junkies-i8-traiaiJt& travelled to the 
much-maligaed campa. of UC 
Riverside to take on sollie of the 
top DivisioD IU 'A' equads in a 
test UCSD team depth. 

'rhe UCR campus lived down 
to its reputation, II the forboding 
brown skiea kept temperatures 
low and race conditions less than 
ideal. 

The women's team took to the 

course and came away with a fifth-
place finish behind Clairemont 
Mudd Scripps, Occidental, 
Pomona-Pitzer and Redlands. The 
TritoDl were led by Courtney Gray, 
who captured 26tb-place with a 
time of 20:13.8. 

Paola Avila (22:01.2) and Judy 
Quick (22:26.3) botb managed to 
best tbe top performance by a Tri-
ton 8-teamer in last year's River-
side Invitational. Sarah Wayson 
(23:07.4) and Rose Campos 
(23:09.6) also came within range 
of the previous UCSDbenchmark. 

"This was a chance to test our 

'0' team against the strength of 
the divilion," UCSD Head Coach 
Ted Van Arsdale said. "It wu a 
much im proved team performance 
over lut year, where our number-
one runner ran 23:06." 

The men's team chugged home 
with a fourtb-place finish a mere 
two points behind the 'A' team of 
Pomona Pitzer. Occidental and 
Clairemont also came in ahead of 
the Triton crew. 

UCSD was paced by tbe efforts 
of Steve Varnell, who covered the 
course in a time of 27:33.6. Mike 
Wallace came across bot on the 

hecla of the Tritons' frontru8aer 
with a solid time of 27:3S.3. 

"Five athletea made good steps 
over '94; Van Arsdale said. 
"Though improvement will come 
with further fitneas and racing ex-
perience, we will need better ef-
forts from several key competitors ~ 
on this squad." 

The Tritons have two weeks 
until the UC San Diego Invita-
tional, which will be run on Satur-
day, Oct. 7. The Tritons hope to be 
primed and ready to give a rude 
welcoming to the teams they will 
be hosting. .

EDGED: UCSD polo 
fell to Long Beach St., 7-6 
Continued from ..... 32 
nIfty alley-oop goal. Each team closed out the 
half with an additional goal, knotting the 
game at 3-3. 

It appeared that the Tritons might break . 
away in the third quarter. Giulianotti ignited 
the crowd when he launched a two-point goal 
that gave the home squad a 5-
3 advantage. 

But the 4gers responded with two goals of 
their own for the eventual win. 

UCSD's big opportunity to tie the contest 
came with only 49 ticks remaining on the 
game clock. With the Tritons on offense, 
Long Beacb lost a player to ejection. Harper 
quickly signaled for a time-out to talJc things 
over with his crew. 

When play resumed, the Tritons squan-
dered the one-man .advantage by promptly 
turning the ball over. 

Harper credits his team's 
last-minute lapses to a lack 
of intensity. Long Beach was again 

able to claw its way back, as 
Jefferson Hall added two 
goals to tie the match. 

The final quarter went 

"We have to have con-
stant intensity as a division 

W.I. "DUly J. 2 &oaIs (1 2iItt) III team," Harper said. "'t's 
down to the wire. The Tritons broke the 5-5

Football News 
And Notes 

At. I slowly backed away 
from the television last Sunday 
afternoon, only one thought 
wu on my mind: TluJnk God 
football is bacJc. 

Now, on any given 
weekend, I can tum on the tele 
and indulge in a SO-yard pass 
reception, a back-breaking 
quarterback sack or a blocked 
punt tbat is returned for a 
touchdown. The sight of six-
foot-six-inch, 3S0-pound men 
colliding against each other 
brings joy to my life - that, 
and a good buzz. 

I, and every other sports fan 
in America, had to suffer 
through a summer of watching 
greedy, fat, overpaid baseball 
players complain about lack of 
fan attendance. And, as if that 
weren't enough to chap my 
bide, tbe world-renowned TV 
show "Blossom" was can-
ceUed.

TURN-AROUND: UCSD recovered from a rough 
start, knocking off Div. II foes ~CR and CSUDH 

' By D .. Kreft 
Sports Editor 

No one could blame the UCSO 
women's volleyball team for its 
rocky start this year. Witb injuries 

plaguing the Tritons' 
all-American core of 
Madelyn Ripken, 
Christine Chi and 
Angelle Crochet (as 
well as projected 
starter Heather 
Newell), UCSD had 
struggled to produce 

the offensive attack it needed to 
win. 

And, when 15th ranked, Divi-
sion II, UC Riverside, strode into

Bonnie Kelly(15 kills) assisted

offense, while sophomore Sherine 
Ebadi stepped up at the ali-impor-

five-game upset of the favored Riv-

The Tritons lost game two as 
easily as they won the first game, 
and the match was even at a game 
apiece. In game three, UCSD 
stormed out to a buge lead with the 
momentum again unhindered by a 
pair of UCR timeouts. 

Freshman middle blocker Shan-
non Noonan pounded down a quick 

set by Ebadi that made it 13-1 after 
the second timeOut, eliminating any 
Riverside hopes of a comeback . 

The 15-4 game-three score was 
finalized on a pair of nice plays by 
Chi and Ebadi. A huge spike by Chi 
off a nice back set from Ebadi set up 
the ensuing game point, which was

Crunch time. The game is on the 
line. Only seconds remain on the 
clock. Everyone's eyes are focused 

on the player with the 
ball. It is here where 
winners are sepa-
rated from losers. It's 
what sports is all 
about. 

As head coach of 
the 10tb-ranked 
UCSD water polo 

team (3-7), Denny Harper has seen 
his sbare of close contests - espe-
cially this year, where down-to-the-
wire battles seem to be a daily oc-
currence. More often than not, the 
Tritons have been on the short end 
of the ~tick. 

"I'm getting a little pissed-off at 
these one-point losses, " Harper said.

He saw it again on Saturday at 
the Canyonview pool, where the 
Tritons dropped a 7-6 h,.rtbreaker 
to seventh-ranked Long Beach State 

(4-4). 
Just like the Tritons' previous 

contests, this one was up in the air 
until the final seconds. 

After being thwarted 
early on by the Triton 
defense, Long Beach 
broke through first on a 
goal by Jeff Rose with 
3:48 remaining in the 
opening quarter. 

This lead was short-
lived though, thanks to 
a strong cross-goal shot 
by Greg Salvinski from
