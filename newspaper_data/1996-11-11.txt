Ubrary Considers 
Trimming Desk Hours 
CUTBACK: Gerald Lowell 
wants to save $545,000 this 
year and next 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Soaring costs and shrinking budgets may 
force the evening and weekend closure of the 
Geisel Library's reference and current periodi-
cals desks, as well as the weekday closure of the 
library's main information desk. 

Univer~ Librarian Gerald Lowell's "Pro-
grammatic Priorities Document," released last 

month for intemallibrary review, iden!ifie ' 'ev-
eral ways for the librarie to trim $545,000 from 
the sa lary budget and reallocate the money to 
other, high-priority needs in the curren! and next 
fiscal years. 

According to Lowell , the libraries' budget 
have been cut consistently since the 1990-9 1 
fiscal year and things have reached the point that 
"we cannot continue to do business as usual." 

"We no longer have the luxury of providing, 
or allempting to provide, 'Cadillac' levels of 
service in all our areas," Lowell wrote. "We may 
have to accept a more basic, fundamental level

Student 
Leaders Meet 
AtUCSD 
SOLunONS: Nearly 600 
students from across the state 
attend leadership conference 
Adam Nichols 
Guardian Reporter 

Over 575 students from California universi-
ties converged at the Price Center on Sunday, 
for the 1996 Excel Regional Leadership Confer-
ence. 

The conference is an annual event at UCSD 
and is put on by UCSO's Interfraternity Council 
and Panhellenic Associati n. 

Featured speaker Charles Perel kicked off 
the conference with open forums on same-sex 
marriages and affirmative action. 

"There is nothing wor~C in the world ... than 
a forum where pcopk don't speak out ," Perez 
said . "Don' t ew r he bs than hravc." 

Several panclist~ , repre~enting hoth sides of 
the issue, offercd theIr po~itions on same-sex 
marriage. 

"'Same-sex marriagel is ahout a fundamen-
tal redelinition of what marriage is," panelist 
Jeff Johnslon, a represenlative of Alternatives, a 
non-profit Christian organization, said. "Ho-
mosexuality i. a changeahle h ' havior." 

Myron Quan, an attorney for the Lambda 
Legal Defense Fund said thaI the real issue that 
must be add res ed is prejudice. 

"The basic issue is equality, justice and fair-
ness," Quan said. 

Quan compared current opposition to same-
sex marriages to simi lar feelings in the 1960's 
toward interracial marriages, which were legal-
ized at a federal level in 1969. 

During the second part of th~forum , a differ-
ent panel discussed affirmative actIOn In Ihe 
state of California. 

Panelist Larry Alexander. prores~oror law at 
USD, spoke out against affirmative-action pro-
grams, claiming that discrinllnation is now in-
herently wrillen into state law. 

"The state of alifomia has divided U\ Into 
an arbi trary number of racial group~ l because of 
affirmalive action I," Alexander said. • 

However, Alexander added that certain out-
reach programs that target minorities but do not 
give them admis ion or hiring advantages helped, 
rather lhan harmed, society.

Professor Studies Proposed LA Infrastructure Improvements 
TRADE: Stephen Erie 
says region is 'victim of 
its own success' 
c .... tIna....., 
St"" Writer . 

With $207 billion in international 
trade in I99S, rhe Los Anaeles Cus-
toms District surpassed its New York 
counterpart as the nation's leading 
trade center, 

UCSD political Keena: Profes-
sor Stephen Erie, in a study com-
missioned by the University of 
California' sCalifornia PGIicy Semi-

nar, examined the need vital infra-
structure improvements and the ef 
fects such projects would have on 
the regional economy. 

More than 25 percent of greater 
Los Angeles' $430 billion gross re-
gional product - representing rhe 
world's eleventh-largest economy 
- now depends on international 
trade. 

In order to continue to capitalize 
on growin, economic opportunitie , 
especially in Pacific Rim tnde where 
60 percent of the world's economic 
growth in the nellt 10 years is ex-
pected 10 occur, vlSl i~nls 

in the region 's ports, railways and 
airports are needed. 

Erie's commillee included James 
Rauch, a professor of economics at 
UCSD, and Harold Brauckman, a 
consultant to the Simon Weisenthal 
Center. 

According to Erie, the greater 
Los Anleles region's infrastructure 
needs serious renovation before it 
becomes "a victim of its own suc-
cess." 

"Unprecedented conlcsrion 
threatens irs airports, rail and high-
way system - and the problem 
could worsen." Erie said, "Asia. our 

chief trading partner, is the world's 
fastest growing region. As a result, 
already-crowded ports and airports 
face a doubling, even tripling of 
demand by 2015." 

Erie's study analyzes 
Califomia'sthree largest infrastruc-
ture projects: the $4 billion Los 
Anleles and Lonl Beach port im-
provements; the $2 billion Alameda 
Corridor rail and truck project: and 
plans to upgrade the los Anae\e 
Intemational (LAX) and Ontario 
airports.

Marketers pay less than S 1,000

through IKE. 

Although IKE is an adverlise-

said IKE is primarily a "service

He added that UCSD holds edi-
torial license with IKE, and can 
refuse or accept any advertisement 
it chooses. 

According to Scull. entertain-

intended to "kill downtime between 
classes" and offer students some-
thing interesting to do, he said. 

" As long as UCSD students use 
it and like it , it will stay" he said. 

Carruthers says thai if IKE is 
successful, the university may in-
stall another IKE kiosk on campus 
- most likely at RIMAe. 

"Nothing is definite, "Carruthers

UCSD Literature Professor Puts Personal Spin On Poetry 
WORDS: Quincy 
Troupe tries to make 
poems understandable 
By Rebekah MIc:helS9n 
Guardian Reporter 

At the University of California, 
San Diego, nothing is average _ 
especially not Literature Professor 
Quincy Troupe. 

Troupe , a world - renowned 
poet, dresses with a casual flair, 
wears his hair in dreadlocks and 
speaks softly with great purpose. 
Born in Saint Loui s, Mi ssouri . 
Troupe was one of six African-
Ameri can children enrolled in an 
otherwi se while school. 

Troupe said he first gained a love 
for books asachild when his mother 
would read to him all kindsoflitera-
ture and encourage him to read on 
his own. 

"There were many books around 
the house," Troupe said. " Not nec-
essari ly only poetry, but the clas-
sics ... Faulkner, He ningway, 
Hawthorne .... " 

Troupe said he became inter-
e ted in poetry because of his 

mother's influence. He describes 
himself as a poet who is African-
American - not an African -
American poet. 

"I am an African-American male, 
but I am an American poet writing 
American poetry," he said. 

According to Troupe, poetry falls 
into two categories - understand-
able and gibberish. 

"There are two strains of Ameri -
can poetry: Whitman and Pound! 
Elliot," he said. "Pound and Elliot 
can be satisfying, but Whitman i 
for everyone." 

Troupe said one of his greatest 
influences was the Chilean poet 
Pablo Neruda, who believed that 
poetry can be both complex and 
simple at the same time. 

"Literature and poetry can and 
should be something that poets and 
readers can li ve with," Troupe said. 
He added that hi s work, like 
Ncruda's, was both simple and com-
plex at the same time. 

According to l iterary critic J. 
Douglas Allen-Taylor, Troupe 
strives to make poetry more acces-
sible to the reader. 

" Quincy Troupe wants to lake 

"Quincy Troupe 
wants to take 
po.try In a n.w 
dlreetlon, away from 
the confln •• of 
boring, Int.llectual 
rlddl •• that puzzl. 
the mind and turn 
million. of peopl. 
off po.try." 

- J. Douglas Allen-Taylor 
literary Critic 

Metro Literary Quarterly 
poetry in a ncw direction, away 
from the confines of boring, intel-
lectual riddles that puzzle the mind 
and tum millions of people off po-
etry," Allen-Tay lor wrote in the 
Metro Literary Quarter/y. 

A lIa/anche, Troupe ' s seventh 
book, was published thi s year by 
Coffee House Press. 

"A I'alane/le is di vided into three 
stages," he said. "The first poem is 
the initial breaking away of the 
mountain. This first part is filled 

with cacophonous noise and vio-
lence ... it is utterly insistent." 

Although the poem's subject is 
an avalanche, Troupe does not 
specify it as such- instead. he uses 
"sty listica lly, formalistic poetic lan-
guage" filled with sound words like 
"CRACK!" 

The second stage of A valallche 
is the moving of the loosened mate-
rial. trying to find a spot to rest. The 
third stage is that of peace - " If a 
plane flew over the place where an 
avalanche occurred, it would be 
impossible to tell that one had oc-
curred." 

A few of Troupe's piece are 
based on political issues. and his 
own experiences as an African-
American male li ving in the United 

tates. However. Troupe denied that 
his poetry was wriuen for a specific 
audience. 

" My Pgetry is foreveryone." he 
said. '" am an equa l-opportunity 
hiller. I cri ti cize whatever I be-
lieve needs cri ti cism . That is. after 
all. what makes a ,.good democ-
racy." 

Troupe moved to Ca li fornia 
from New York in 1990, to re-

move his then-sevcn-year-old son 
from what he considered the nega-
ti ve innuences of New York, as 
well as his growing dissatisfaction 
with the state and his need for a 
change of geographical location in 
his writing . 

Beforecomingto UCSD, Troupe 
taught graduate studenls at Colum-

It is a widely acknowledged truth that a stu-
dent wanting a college education is going to 
have to take on an immense burden to pay for it. 
This is especially true in Califomia, where, in 
addition to Congress' decision last year to chop 
off $10 billion in tudent loans over the next 
seven years, the Board of Regents is thinking 
about raising student fees by $33 million. 

How are students going to cope? We all look 

Two-thirds of the 
respondents to National 
Student Aid Association 

(NSAA) survey agreed 

to financial aid for help, whether it 
takes the form of scholarships, 
grants, work-study programs or 
loans. Yet, as UCSD Financial Aid 
Director Vince Deande affirms, 
''There has been a trend the last 15 
years where there isn 't enough gift 
aid . The trend will eventually reach 
a poin! where it won't be able to 
retreat. But the university is now 
working at reversing the trend." Is 
the UC actively working to allevi -

Amazingly, ome people actual-
ly think so. They actually believe 
that the regents want to help stu-

dents. In reality, we are told that the university is 
still fat:ing tight budgets and there is no other 
choice but to raise student fee s. Be, ide , higher 
fecs are not really that big of a problem because 
onc-third of all fcc increases go toward financial 
aid, 

In effect, wealthier students are being asked 
to pay more while less amuent students can get 
by on increased financial aid. The solution to ris-
ing fees is cast as a kind of Robin Hood scheme: 
Take from the rich, give to the poor, 

I smell something lishy here. From the looks 
of it, it's a plot comparable to the Democrats' 
ideal of maintaining high tax rates on the 
wealthy, so that their taxes can go toward help-

. ing out people who have trouble paying for 
health care and other necessities. Perhaps the

shouldn't have a problem dishing out some eWa

that it is possible that by the time 
a student is in his senior year, he'll 
have to find a way to pay back 
$21,89 in student loans. This 
number might not apply to a UC 
student, but it is a sign of the 
times. In this respect our future 
has become extremely shaky. 
Instead of working to build a life 
for our families , we'l l find our-
elves working to payoff our

As for future studcnts, finan-

Is there a solution for this all ? 
Is there a way for students to pay

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday. November II, 1996 

. CCRI PIECE IGNORED THE REALITY OF RACISM 
Editor: 

Chris Schreiber ("Anti -CCRI 
Forces Practi ce Real Racism," 
Gllardian, Nov. 4) obviously lives 
in a fantasy world where everyone 
is equal, where there are no ghet-
tos, no under-funded schools with 
apathetic teachers, no overcrowded 
classrooms and no racism . 
Unfortunately, this is not the world 
we livein. 

The fact of the matter i , all 
individuals are not treated equally 
in society. All individuals are not 
given "freedom and equality under 
the law." Go to the barrio or the 
ghetto and you'll see the kind of 
equal opportunity that lies there. If 
it is society 'S job to "open opportu-
nities to competi tion from all 
sources," then why aren' t people of 
color and women given the ski lls 
and education needed to compete 
equally with privileged white 

males~ 
1 believe I benefited from affir-

mative action, but I don't feel it 
was a privilege or a prefercnce in 
any way. I know I possess the meri t 
to belong at this uni versity, but 1 
am not naive to the fact that when 
society sees me, they only sec me 
for my gender and my race. 
Affirmative action is not about giv-
ing handouts - it's about giving a 
fair chance that people of color 
deserve as American . 

Proposi tion 209 isjust a way for 
the ~ Iready dominant white to try 
to keep people of color from suc-

cceding. The fact that the editorial 
board of the schoo l newspaper 
endorses this covertly racist initia-
tive is incredibly scary to me. My 
suggestion for Mr. Schreiber is to 
live a day as a poor black person. 
Then maybe he'll understand what 
racism truly is.

Editor: 

Chris Schreiber's "analysis" of 
the CCRI opponents was, like the 
bulk of pro-CCRI rhetoric, mis-
guided, close-minded and. yes, 
racist. 

Characterizing anti-CCRI crit-
ics in animalistic terms such as 
"squcaling" and "gnashing-of-
teeth" was utterly offensive. How 
does Mr. Schreiber know that his 
readers res~nded in such a man-
ner? Could he actually hear their 
reactions? Did their letters include 
notations for animal noi ses? Or 
was that simply the way he chose 
to read and interpret their argu-
ments? 

Schreiber also invited his read-
ers to "take a look at the two posi-
tions concerning racial-preference 
programs and decide which is 
racist." In doing so, it is clear that 
the CCRI proponents are, or at the 
very least cater to and thereby 
make themselves bedfellows of,

California's racists. The fact that 
Dan Lungren lobbied and won the 
right to have Proposition 209 li sted 
as "ending racial-preference pro-
grams" as opposed to "ending affir-
mative-action programs" highlights 
this point. Had the latter been used , 
the whole story of CCRI would 
have been addressed. By choosing 
the former, the opponents played 
upon and manipulated the ignorant 
fears of the racist members of our 
society. 

Schreiber also claimed that pro-

CCRI people are "for individuals 
being judged on individual accom-
plishments, merit and behavior." 
So arc anti-CCRI people. Except 
We beli('ve that in determining 
these qualities. gender and ethnic 
background are just as telling 
determinants as extracurricular 
activities, sports, nepotism or eco-
nomic background. 

I don't know one woman or per-
son of color (regardless of class) 
who, in dealing with men or people 
of different ethnicities, has escaped 
the damaging, belittling and dehu-
manizing experience of sexism or 
racism. Enduring lewd behavior; 
being called "cunt," "chick," "nig-
ger," "wetback," "coon" or "gook"; 
having one's heart broken on 
account of one's color; being fol -
lowed in stores; being pulled over 
and harassed by "Officers of the 
Peace" all combine to make one 
second guess one's worth as a ci ti-
zen and a human. Often, all one can 
do is go home and rage or cry or 
hang one's head in questionable 
shame. And yet being determined 
to lift one's head and push forward 
in spite of all thi s horrible and 
unnecessary (yet ever-present) bag-
gage isn't to be taken into consider-
ation. 

As for Schreiber's analysis of 
the anti-CCRI claim that people of 
specifIC races cannot succeed 
because of their race, he misses the 
point. No logical CCRI opponent 
would claim that one's race inhibits 

one' ability. Rather it is the per-
eption other people have of one 's 

race which is the problem. People 
who never bothered to actually 
learn and understand the philoso-
phy behind affirmative action, and 
people who mismanage affirma-
tive-action programs are responsi -
ble for the erroneous analysis of 
affirmative action as a means of 
promoting otherwise unqualified 
people into positions for which 
they are not suited. 

Affirmative action has prob-
lems, but it is working in fits and 
starts, especially for white women. 
It needs to be fixed, not abandoned. 
Who in their right mind can argue 
that one generation of effort is suf-
ficient remedy for over 300 years 
of di scriminalion~ II' s sad but true: 
Patience is not an American virtue. 
Neither is it a European-American 
or male virtue. Patience and dili -
gent hard work have spanned the 
more than 100 years of organized 
black political struggle, the strug-
gle for women's rights and civil 
rights for Native Americans, 
Latinos, Asian Americans and oth-
ers. 

Affirmative action is a struggle 
for the future . Yes, it is nawed and 
needs to be healed, not dismissed at 
this crucial and reactionary time in 
American politics and values. 
Affirmative action is a tool for the 
future. Scrapping it is an evocation 
of the past.

Course Description: Increasing use of the internet, . 
multimedia, and visualization tools in every aspect of engineering, 
medicine, arts, and business is changing the character of engineering 
education. Image engineering has become an essential ingredient of all 
engineering and computing discipl ines. This one-quarter course will cover 
basic elements of mulitmedia computing with emphasis on irpage and 
video processing. 

This course will cover the role of visual thinking image and video 
formation, ~eneration, analysis and understanding of images and video, 
representational formats, and basic processing and compresssion ideas 
central to multimedia systems. 

Our emphasis in this course will be on basic concepts and commonly 
available tools that can be used by students to develope image based 
systems, including systems for WWW. Students will use popular software 
(lib Mat~ Photoshop, and Premier) to learn basic concepts and use 
them in dinerent applications. 

The course will be based upon notes supppIied by the instructor and 
will involve extensive use of computer based tools. Programming 
experience is desirable, but not required.

EXCEL: 
Professor blasts 
politics of division 
Continued from pace 1 
Mexican-American living in Texas. 

'There was so much discrimina-
tion that when we tried to move into 
a white neighborhood, our house 
was stoned," Senour aid.-

She said that because of her race, 
she did not have the opportunity to 
attend a universjty until she moved 
to Michigan. 

" If you educate a Mexican, you 
losea farm worker," Senour said, in 
reference to the Texas political cli-
mate. 

She added that affirmative ac-
tion would help correct t~e wrongs 
created by race discrimination. 

"Affirmative action is a legal at-
, templto open opportunities to people 

who have been closed out not only 
historically, but currently," Senour 
said. 

Midway through the discussion, 
Perez asked, "I'm wondering if we, 
without knowing it, surround our-
selves with clones of us." 

Panelist Sanford Lakoff took is-
sue with Perez' implication that the 
individual does not seek diversity. 

''The whole effort to divide us . . 
. is morally wrong and against ev-
erything America is all about," 
Lakoff said. 

According to Senour, social ills 
unsolved via affirmative action re-
quire higher-quality education and 
more responsive leaders who are 
attuned to the needs of the populace. 

After the panel discussions, at-
tendees had the option of attending 
discussion scssions. Among the ses-
sion facilitators were Revelle Col-
lege Dean of Student Affairs Renee 
Barnett and UCSD Professor Emeri-
tus Willie Brown. 

In her session, Barnett addressed 
the importance of good communi-
cation by leaders in bringing about 
change. 

"Having effcctive communica-
tion ski lls is really not an option 
anymore," Barnett agreed. "The 
more eff ecti ve you can be as a com-
municator, the more effective you 
will be as a person." 

She added that attitude, feedback 
and body language are important in 
becoming an effective communica-
tor. 

"Many tllnes, our nonverbal 
[communication] speaks as loudly 
as our verbal." Barnell said.

LmRARY: 
Department heads' 
reports due Jan. 1 
Continued from pace 1 
of operation in certain areas." 

The document identifies ix 
needs as the mo t vital to the librar-
ies' future: maintaining current ac-
quisitions levels; supporting the 
proposed UC Digital Library; in-
creasing education, outreach and 
user support programs; integrating 
internal library financial systems 
with exist ing campuswide systems; 
increasing library hours; and bol-
steringexisting fundraisingefforts. 

Lowell initially est imated that 
meeting the ix needs would co t 
$985.000, but he rcduced the 
amount to $545,000 by scrapping a 
$440,000 " InfoStation" proposal. 

Lowell stressed that the pos-
si ble savings listed in the docu-
ment were "very rough estimates," 
and that library oHicials would meet 
ovcr the coming months to deter-
mine the feasibility of the cuts. 

Lowell suggested that closing 
the three desks could result in up to 
$130,000 in savings, and that the 
library could make up the human 
shortfall with the increased use of 
voice mail, telephone trees and 
printed and online help. 

Although few library employ-
ees were willingtogive their names 
for fear of losing their jobs, many 
spoke against the proposals. 

"You ca'n' t replace actual people 
at desks with machines and not 
suffer some loss in friendliness and 
accessibi lity," one reference I i brar-
ian said. 

"I think the worst part is closing 
the information desk," another ref-

erence librarian said. hit's a really 
good, vital service point." 

However, not everyone agreed 
on the information desk's impor-
tance. 

"The information desk is for 
people who are too lazy to look 
stuff up for themselves," Marshall 
senior Adam Linson said. "I think 
everything you can find at the in-
formation desk

he said. "I'm not able to state un-
equivocally that there will be no 
layoffs, but the library has not done 
that yet." 

While the libraries have never 
had to lay people off against their 
will, Lowell said some people 
choose to be laid off so they can 
take advantage of preferential re-
hiring policies.

but. that's not the 
case with the ref-

"We do have the

Lowell said the

La-well al 0 
proposed install-
ing self-checkout 
machines at the 
larger libraries, as 
well as charging 
for the Library

Lowell pro-
posed that the ini-

ies' salary budget,

$9.6 million per

year. 
The II UCSD libraries currently 

have approximately 260 career 
employees and 430 student work-
ers. 

Lowell has imposed a hiring 
freeze on the libraries to ensure a 
"wide smorgasbord" of open posi -
tions for employees who are reas-
signed or whose positions are elimi-
nated 

"We do have the potential for 
people to be reassigned from what 
they are doing to something e'lse," 

in all his ideas, 
and I think it'" work. Our priority 
is to help patrons as best we can." 

Lowell said library depanment 
heads will study the feasibility of 
the cuts and complete theirevalua-
tions by Jan. I, 1997. The library 
cabinet - consisting of Lowell, 
the four associate university librar-
ians, representatives from the li-
braries' four organizational dus-
ters and a budget officer - will 
make final decision by Feb. I, 
1997.

TRADE: 
Airports are key to 
region's success 
ContInued from Pac. 1 
spending on port, rail and airport 
projects-excluding the LAX Mas-
ter Plan - is $4.3 billion dollars, 
making these projects the largest 
fi ve-year capital-spending program 
for trade-related infrastructure of any 
metropolitan area in the nation. 

While the Los Angeles and Long 
Beach Port Devefopments are cur-
rently on schedule, logistical and ad-
ministrative problems may delay 
completion of the projects unti 12020. 

According to the study, the eco-
nomic benefits from the pon devel-
opment projects are substantial. In 
1987, port-related activities ac-
counted for 363,000 jobs, the pons 
generated 500,000 jobs in 1994, and 
the study projects a 250 percent 
cargo increase when the expansion 
is completed in 2020 - ultimately 
creating 15,000 construction jobs 
and 700,000 new port indUStry, ten-
ant and user jobs in the region. 

However, the successes of the 
Los Angeles and Long Beach 
projects are dependent on other port-
related projects - especially the 
Alameda Corridor Project, which 
will improve ground access to the 
ports. 

At $2 billion, the Alameda Cor-
ridor project is the "state's largest 
inter-modal project designed to fa-
cilitate rail and truck access to and 
from the Long Beach and Los An-
geles ports while mitigating the side 
effects of port growth - such as 
traffic congestion and air pollution." 

The project also includes plans 
to create an uninterrupted 20-mile,

high-speed rail system, linking the 
ports with the downtown rail termi-
nals. 

EI Toro,-George, March and Point 
Mugu - LAX will remain the 
region's international airport fort he 
near future. According to the study, while 

rai I and port expansions are vital to 
Southern California's future eco-
nomic vitality, airports contribute 
the most to the region's economy -
so the adequate and timely expan-
sion of airport facilities is crucial. 

LAX now accounts for $43 bil-
lion in economic activity - 10 per-
cent of the region's gross product-
and supports nearly 400,000 jobs in 
the region's five counties. 

"Airports are 
the region ' s 
Achilles' heel," 
Erie said. "The 
problem is that all 
the region's inter-
national eggs, 
both cargo and 
passenger traffic, 
are in one basket 
- LAX - and 
that basket is 
nearly full." 

If the airport is expanded to meet

expected demand, 
an additional 
310,000 jobs and 
$31 billion in re-
gional economic 
activity will be 
generated. How-
ever, such a plan 
would face severe 
challenges - lo-
gistical, physical, 
environmental and 
practical. 

According to 
Erie, the Los An-
geles International 
Airport has long-
term capacity con-
straints in every 
way : air space, 
land, runways, 

Professor of Political Science 

The study sug-
ge~ted several 
methods of deal -
ing with the chal-
lenges, but rec-
ommended over-
all that state offi-

taxiways and ground transportation. 
The Los Angeles and Ontario 

airport expansion project is the fur-
thest from completion, due to plan-
ning delays and looming facility 
shortfalls at LAX. 

In 2015, LAX will serve 98 mil-
lion annual passengers - a I OO-per-
cent increase - and air cargo will in-
crease I 4O-percent 104.2 million tons. 

By the year 2000, airport offi-
cials anticipate a shortfall of at least 
29 passenger gates and 82 acres of 
cargo area. 

Despite the numerous closed 
military bases in the area- Norton, 

cials, in conjunc-
tion with regional transponation 
planning agencies, develop a com-
prehensive plan' for dealing with 
future expansion. 

"Given the vital importance of 
global trade to the California 
economy, and the need to expand 
the state's import/export infrastruc-
ture, state policy makers and re-
gionaltransportation planning agen-
cies ... need to make goods-move-
ment planning and priority funding 
of inter-modal projects, central ele:

nomic strategy forthe 21 st century ,"

Make-up Artist Maureen

:J)0wntown La Jolla is now horne to M. Burke Maquillage 
- the cosmetic, ~kill 

and body care line developed by 
leadi ng make-up arti st Maureen 
Burke for high-profile celebrities. 
Her famed clientele includes the 
alternative-rock group Srnashi ng 
Pumpkins, actress Cameron Diaz 
and Chicago Bulls superstar 
Michael Jordan, to name just a 
few. 

Maureen Burke began her 
career in 1981 in Chicago as a 
make-up artist for Vida l Sassoon. 
A decade later, Burke developed 
the M. Burke Maqui lIage IlIle. 
Unfortunately, the products were 
initially avai lable through mail 
order only. Finally, the M. Burke 
Maquillage ~tudio/store opened its 
doors in La Jolla last month and is 
now open for business to the pub-
lic. 

Burke's store fea tures an array 
of products in addition to the M. 
Burke Maquillage line . These 
include the outrageous Make Up 
Forever line of cosmetics, Bumble 
& Bumble Haircare, handmade 

jewelry, cand les, soaps, bath crys-
tal. , and body oib, as well as 
clothing designed by Debby Dean. 
Guardian: What Initially 
attracted you to the make-up 
business? 

Burke: I wa~ always involved 
in theater and make-be lieve grow-
ing up. My mother \.!ven has a pic-
ture of me ,s a little girl silling in 
a circle wi th all of my neighbor-
hood girlfriends. In the middle of 
everYlhing, I had all of my mom's 
make-up spread around. I guess I 
used to do all of the girls' make-up 
in our neighborhood . And that was 
probably the beginning of my 
make-u p career. 
Whom would you name as the 
main influences in your road to 
success? 

Mari c Augustine from Vidal 
Sa~\oon was ext reme ly innuen-
tia!. he trained me and taught 1m: 
how (0 do a really good, all-
around make-over - one that you 
could do at home by yourself. 

Marie Anderson Boyd was also 
very important. She was'lhe vice-
president of Elile Model ing

Celebrity Make-up Artist's Products are

n
ot many make-up anists 
have the clout to develop 

their own cosmetic, skin 
and body care lines. Even 

fewer can get away with 
opening up their own stores to carry 
such products - especialJy in the 
ritzy and discriminating environ-
ment of La Jolla. 

Then again, most make-up artists 
aren't Maureen Burke. Since begin-
ning her career in 1981 for Vidal 
Sassoon in Chicago, Burke has 
made her way through the ranks and 
worked with some big-name stars. 

An oft-quoted expen on make-up 

tips, Burke has recently been a valu-
able source on anicles within the 
pages of glamour magazines such as 
Vogue, Allure, Self and Mirabella. 
She has worked with superstars like 
Michael Jordan and her award-win-
ning work is high-profile - like in 
MTV's 1996 best video of the year, 
"Tonite, Tonite," in which he 
supervised the make-up for the 
Smashing Pumpkins . Indeed, Burke 
is no run-of-the-mill make-up anist. 

Burke's own line, M. Burke 
Maquillage - developed to meet 
clients' requests for specific colors 
and products - will be the jewel of 

the new retail store of the same 
name, located on Prospect Street in 
La JolJa. First developed in 1992, 
the exclusive line had previously 
only been available through mail 
order. 

A resident of San Diego ince 
1995, Burke settled down here for a 
much-needed reprieve from her 
busy travel schedule. Dutifully, 
however, she has not neglected 
wQrk. She came to the area to 
devote more time to accommodat-
ing the ever-increasing demand for 
her own product line. Additionally,

WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF ELECTION RESULTS? 

I was really disappoint-
ed with Prop 209. I think 
that a lot of students were 

[~Iso disappointed] be-
cause of the amount of 
protest that has been going 
on at school. I was very 
happy that Clinton was 
elected. I was just sur-
prised by the amount of 
Republicans in <:;alifomia. 
I thought California was 
more democratic than that. 

.... Mu ....... 
Warren Junior 

Interviews by Prlya Honeyman • Photography by Alii Macisaac 

Well I voted for Bill 
Clinton. I think [Prop] 209 
is wrong because basically 
they think that there will 
be equality of opportunity 
if they take away affinna-
tive action and I think 
that's total bullshil. 
There's no way there's 
equality of opportunity to 
all people under our cur-
rent system. 

Tor Unsworth 
Roosevelt Sophomore 

I'm happy about some 
of the propositions, like 
Prop 209, but I'm not 
happy that Clinton won. 

........... 

Revelle Freshman 

As far as the presiden-
tial election, J don't know 
if there really was a good 
outcome possi ble. 
Personally I voted for 
Ralph Nader if that means 
anything. As far as the 
props go, they all pretty 
much came out the way I 
wanted them to, except for 
[Prop] 209. Like everyone 
else on campus I was pret-
ty disappointed. 

P.IButId 
Muir Senior 

I guess it 's pretty good 
that Clinton won. None of 
the candidates were really 
good, because Clinton is 
over rated and Dole is kind 
of too old. I would have 
picked Dole if he was 
younger. He has a great 
stand for some subjects in 
America. I didn't like that 
Prop 209 passed. I think 
that a lot of students didn't 
vote and a lot of people are 
not sure of the wording of 
the propositions. I'm 
happy, though.

highlight of your career so 
far? 

Of course, the opening of the 
store was a huge hi ghlight. 
Working with the Smashing 
Pumpkins was al so great becausc 
the members allowed me to be 
creati ve with my make-up -
which is always fun . Also, going to 
and being a part of the MTV Video 
Music Awards was a blast. It was 
almost like too much candy, 
because every where [ turned , 
someone famous was standing 
right next to me. 
Has It 8Iways been a goal of 
you,. to develOp your own 
line of coametlts and 
eventualy open your own 
stor.? 

Definitely. The store has always 
been a goal of mine since I started 
working at Vidal Sassoon in 1981 . 
h has taken a 101 of time and hard 
work to get to thi s point. . 
What products do you 
feMure In rour store tMt are 
not part of the M. Burke 
Maq...a.c. line? 

I feature hair care products from 
Bumble & Bumble out of New 
York City. I also have fun make-up 
from Make Up Forever, which I 
think really complements my line. I 
also have some articles of clothing 
from my friend Debby Dean's 
clothing line. 
What do you eonsld.r to be 
essential products that no 
one should be without If

INXS, who actually opened for 
the Go-Go's then. 
Whet Is It like working with 
such hlllft-prollle c.lebrltles 
such .. the Smashing 
Pumpklne and Cameron 
Ow? 

It's great. I have no complaints. 
I've heard horror stories from 
other artists and so I used to worry 
about getting a drama queen or a 
diva, but working with the 
Pumpkins and Cameron Diaz was 
wonderful. 

[ think it is about how you 
approach them. Some make-up 
artists make the mistake of telling 
their client that what they are 
doing is all wrong. In my case, I

Continued from page 11 
Burke's recent move has granted 
her the opportunity to realize her 
life-long dream of opening her own 
store. The shop located in La Jolla 
is her first, and provides a retai I 
locale for her popular personal line. 

M. Burke Maquillage cosmetics 
- all comple~ly free of animal 
testing - are neut ra l-toned and 
consist of custom-blended 
foundation s and powders in 
addition to lipstick and lip gloss, 
eye shadows and concealers. The 
line also includes an exqui site 

try to consult with them and then 
offer some of my advice. 
Do you pre"r worldna with 
celebrltlea and belnC on 
location as opposed to 
Individual consultations? 

Actually, I love teaching and 
giving private lessons, so ['m 
going to try to cut out a lot of my 
travel time. [ really enjoy making 
people feel better about 
themselves. 
What was It like being a 
part of the video production 
for the ·'Tonlt., Tonlt." 
music video? 

It was brilliant! It was 
definitely one of the best 
experiences I've ever had . The 
Pumpkins are just wonderful to 
work with and it was great being a 
part of such a talented team of 
artists. 
Ar. there any other 
particular acts YDU hope to 

suppl y of defining brushes, entilled 
the Chisel Collecti on and the 
French Collection. 

But the M. Burke Maquill age 
line is hardly limited to make-up. 
Well aware of the growing market 
for skin lotions, Burke has also 
developed the line to offer a vast 
array of face and body care items, 
hoping to cut in on Bath & Body 
Works' business. Designed to 
protect and renew, her body care 
products include such items as 30· 
SPF sunscreen and a Sea Salt & 
Papaya Body Buff. 

Though the La Jolla store 
predominantly features Burke's 
own product line, the inventory 
ex tends to encompass other 
complemenlary items and

work with In the futur.? 
I don't want to say that there is 

any one particular group or person 
that [ really want to work with. 
For me, it's more of a matter of 
surprise. I like it when the phone 
rings and you just don't know who 
or what the next project will be. 
What ar. your plans for the 
future? 

I'm really focusing on the store 
right now. I want a mix of aillypes 
of people to come in to the store 
- such as housewives and 
students - to treat themselves. 
It's a very special space and has a 
very comfortable atmosphere, so 
hopefully it will appeal to a 
variety of people. 

M. Burke Maquillage is located 
at 1266 Prospect St. in Downtown 
La Jolla. Maureen Burke

in and visi t her new store and also 
offers studenl discounts.

The consultations include 

private instructi on by Burke on 
haping and plucking eyebrows, as

valuable lessons learned from this 
campaign, a "trip to Nationals will 
be the goal from the beginning." 

In the present, however, it is the 
outstanding performanc~ofthe men 
that cannot be understated .. In what 
was considered by many to be a 
n:building season, the men's squad 
has done UCSD proud. 

Showing courage in the face of 
adversity, remarkable depth and the 
ability to win the crucial races nec-
essary to advance, the Tritons con-
tinue to build one of the best cross 
country programs in Division HI. A 
satisfied Van Arsdale echoed is 
proud of his team's "determination 
to maintain the best stable of horses 
in the west." 

The performance of these new-
found heroes, stepping up for their 
teammates, proved to be the differ-
ence in clinching the Regional 
title.The men now aim for Rock 
Island, Illinois and the National 
Championships.

Irvin and his host of stooges. I will 
rejoice as Willi am Floyd balters 
down the sidelines; rumblin' , 
stumblin ', bumblin ' for a touch-
down. lerry Rice will show Deion 
how a real receiver is supposed to 
run a route . 

So as I sit here in the wee hours 
of another production night , ) can 
only hope for a rematch. An oppor-
tunity tore-establish the Ninerdomi -
nation that I have grown to love. For 
me, loathing the Cowboys is a pas-
sion. To take delight in their losses 
brings me more joy than recei ving a 
paycheck (always a small one here 
at the Guardiall). So I wait and lurk 
in the background, waiting for my

Fairy-Tale Season Now 
Needs Only a Grand Finale 
CHAPTER: Tritons look to dose out story-book year with a championship 
ByStev.W ..... 
Co-Associate SPOrts Editor 

All of the pieces are in place for 
a fairy-tale ending to the UCSD 
women' volleyball season - a 

first-year coach with 
a wealth of experi -
en ce and knowl -
edge; a team with a 
mix of veteran , se-
nior leadership and 
youthful , underclass 
enthu iasm; and a 
series of roadblocks 

the team had to overco me, includ-
ing a rash of injuries ant! a gruel-
ing schedule of 29 games that in-
cluded thousands of miles of travel. 
All that is needed now is a pair of 
ruby slippers. 

The Tritons are now hoping that 
when they click their heels to-
gether, the NCAA will tell them, 
"There's no place like home." Af-
ter putting together a record of 23-
6 and dominating nearly all of its 
Divi ion III opponents, UCSD is 
now waiting to hea r confirmation 
from the NCAA that they will host 
the Western Regionals this week-
end. 

On Monday. in addit ion to find-
i ng OUt whether they wi II open the 
postseason on their home noor, 
the Tri tons will find out whi ch 
Di vision In squads will join them 
in the tournament. 

Based on the current rank ings, 
UCSD expects to face the Uni ver-
sity of La Verne in the first round 

• and then move on to play arch-
rival California Lutheran, who 
eliminated the Tritons last year. 
The winner of that match will then 
move on to the National Champi-
onships. 

"r think that we can take care of 
La Verne," Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland said , "We played a 
tough match against Cal Lu and 
we learned something about them 
from that match." 

The Trit ons head int o the 
postseason showing some of the 
scars of a grueling season. Setter 
Sherine Ebadi is strugg ling with 
an injured thumb, hitter Madelyn 
Ripken is playing with soreness in 
her s winging shoulder and blocker 
Christine Chi is 

Ebadi , who has been forced to 
handle all of the Tritons' setting 
needs. 

Chapman provided the final 
warm-up for the Tritons on their 
road to the playoffs. In the three-
game sweep, UCSD was able to 
use the majority of its roster and 
ope n up it s offense on the 
outmatched Panthers . Ripken led 
the team with nine kills, while Chi 
and Dana Saller each added seven 
for the match. 

The senior leadership core of 
Ripken. Chi and Mieke Biesheuvel 
gi yes UCSD a strong backbone for 
making a title run . 

After such a strong regular sea-
so n, the Tr itons ent er th e 
postseason with high exp.ectations

THE CYNIC 
SEAN RAHIMI PORT---The Nightmare' 

By the Bay 
It happened. 
I knew the day would come, 

but in all my worst nightmares, 
I could not have foreseen a 
worse outcome. As the proud 
leader of the 4gers fan club 
residing in the Guardian sports 
department, I have witnessed 
the apocalypse. Without 
warning, it struck me like an 
Evander Holyfield counter-
punch. Its devastating force 
will be felt for years to come, 
as we - loyal Niner fafts -
begin to put our lives back in 
order. Its enonnous power can 
only be described as a runaway 
freight train packed with TNT. 

Racing Continues for Tritons 
DETERMINED: UCSD looks to make a big splash at the National Championships in Rock Island, IL 

Yes, I am talking about the 
20-17 overtime defeat of the 
mighty San Francisco 4gers at 
the hands of the hated Dallas 
Cowgirls. Who would have 
ever thought !,hat Barry "Bozo" 
Switzer could be at the helm of 
a Dallas victory against the 
five-time world champions. 
Hell, he hadn ' t beaten the 
Niners since he joined Dallas 
and his drinking buddy, Jerry 
Jones,' in 1994. 

Mo t sports fan recognize 
that Switzer's IQ level hovers 
around 94, but in spite of hi s 
inept coaching, the Cowboys 
get by with superior talent. 
Case in point, Dallas struggled 
to defeat Pittsburgh in the 
annual blowout that is the 
Super Bowl. In defaming the 
NFC, Dallas showed that even 
the best talent in the world 
might not be enough if your 
coach is nicknamed for a 
clown.

When you enter a beaulY con-
test, you want to look your best. 
When you give a concert, you want 

all your in tru-
ments in tune. 
And when you 
are running the 
biggest race of 
the year, you 
want your team 
fully assembled 

and running strong. Against the best 
of the Western Region, the men's 
cross country team was missing 
some key runners, but nonetheless 
pieced together a stellar race to cap-
ture first place. 

The Tritons found themselves 
without team captain and No.2 run-
ner Rhodes Wlllton on Saturday, 
who was . dec lared ineligible as a 
fifth-year senior. Despite being in-
jured the majority of his freshman 
year, the NCAA did not grant Walton 
rcdshirt status, and the leader of the 
squad was forced to step aside. 

The team ' third and fourth run-
ners', Bryan Leek and Mike Wallace. 
were unable to perform at optimal 
levels due to illness, and the situa-
tion was looking bleak as the run-
ners lined up. 

However, a number of perform-
er came through in a major way for 
the Tritons, illustrating the team-
oriented nature of the sport . Gavin 
Klinger continued to shine, pacing 
the lead. pack throughout the race 
before finishing fourth . Neal Harder,

5t ....... Up: Junior Steve Varnellcame up with a clutch race when 
UCSD needed it most and was key to the team's Regional victory. 

meanwhile, proved himself a cham-
pion under tough circumstances. and 
finished only four seconds behind 
Klingerto place sixth. 

FranzwaAchie, normally the No. 
6 runner, came in third with Steve 

Varnell close behind. Sophomore 
Joshua Levin-Soler tinished 21 st 
overall and fifth for the team, dem-
onstrating the tremendous strides he 
has been making all season. 

"Josh gave useverything he had." 

Triton Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
said, helping push the Tritons to the 
number one spot in the west. 

The women had a rocky start, as 
well. One of the team 's top runners, 
Meghan Scott, had an allergic reac-
tion to a bee sting and was unable to 
run with a swollen and painful fool. 
Though eager to race, Van Arsdale 
deemed just before the stan that "it 
was "ot to her safety to let her run." 

The women persevered to run a 
strong race and finish third as a 
team, just short of qualifying for 
Nationals. The dry conditions of 
Chino and a difficult grass course 
proved too much to overcome. 

However, star sophomore 
Maggie Dwire finished fifJh over-
all, earning herself a berth as an 
individual contestant in the Nation-
als, Courtney Gray also ran an ex-
cellent race for the Tritons, finish-
ing 10th, followed two seconds later 
by freshman Amy Kitchen. 

As the women look toward next 
year, they feel assured of greater 
success. Every runner will be re-
turning to what is one of the best 
teams in school history, a fact that 
surely trikes fear into the teams 
that beat out the Tritons - Colo-
rado College and Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps. 

On another, healthier day, the 
women could have defeated either 
of these opponents. Looking at the 
success of this year's team. Dwire 
stated that she is "looking for the 
trend to continue." However, with
