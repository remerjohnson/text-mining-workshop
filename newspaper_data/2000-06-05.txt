ISTANBUL - When a harsh

widespread in Turkey was released 
last week, the surprise was not just 
the amount of damning evidence it 
contamed, but also the source. 

The report was the work of the 
parliamentary committee on 
human rights, not a private advo-
c~cy group. 

F Ir years, Turkish leaders have 
sought to downplay accusations 
that torture is widely practiced 
here. That will be harder now.

Student Falls Victim to Scam 
Female suspea allegedly uses child as an accomplice in theft of student 
theft and makes $2,000 in fraudulent credit card charges 
., F1I1CCA WOOD 
Staf, Writer 

A woman and child allegedly stole a stu-
dent's money and wallet in a scam operation 
last Monday. . 

The 29-year-old female student, was 
approached by the woman and child around 4 
p.m. in Lot 206. According to police, the sus-
pect told the student her daughter had just 
received treatment at Scripps Hospital and 
they needed a ride to their home in Chula 
Vista. The student agreed to take the woman 
and child home. 

According to the polict repon, the woman 
sat in the front passenger seat, and the child sat 
in the back seat. Police suspect that during the 
ride, the child stole the student's wallet and 
money from her purse, which was on the floor 
in the back seat. The loss was approximately 
$20. 

The victim noticed her wallet was stolen 
when she stopped at a gas station after drop-
ping off the passengers. When she tried to can-
cel her credit cards, S2,OOO in fraudulent 
charxes had been made. 

"The woman worked pretty quickly," said 
UCSD Detective Douglas O'Dell. 

Police described the woman as African 
American, in her early 30s. 5'7" and weighing 
170 pounds. She had shoulder-length, red-
streaked black hair worn in a ponytail. She was 
wearing denim overalls, a dark blue sweatshirt 
and ~ jacket. She told the victim her name was 
Christy and that the child's name was Denisha. 
The child is described as being around eight or 
nine years old. 

O'Dell said the child was an "unwitting 
partner" in the crime.

UCSD Receives 
Award for Triton 
Taxi Service 
A.S. Counal's program gets 
gift in recognition of efforts to 
cut down on drunk driving 
Iy .. IICCA WOOD 
Staff WrIter 

UCSD reCeIVed a $1 ,000 College and 
University Dnnking and Driving Prevention 
Award last month for the A.s. Tnton TaXI 
program. 

The annual award was preserw'd by the 
Automobile Club of Southern Califorllld 
and Higher Educallon Center for AI oh I 
and Other Drug Prevention. The award rec-
ognizes colleges and universities in 
Southern California that reduce campus 
drinkll1g and Jriving. and control campus 
alcohol and other dnlg use. 

UCSD won the same award in 1998 for a 
student-run program that emphaSized 
reducing driving under the influence, 
increasing the knowledge and practice of 
responsible beverage service, and imple-
menting integrated and consistent campus 
alcohol policies. 

The Triton Taxi program began in fall 
'99, modeled after a UC Davis program 
called "Tipsy Taxi ." Mati Conroy, A.S. com-
missioner of services and enterprises for 
2000-2001 and director of Triton Taxi, said 
the program at UCSD ha~ been very suc-
cessful and effective so far. 

"Functionally, it's the same as Davis' , 
except it's free here," Conroy said. 

The free taxi service is available to 
undergraduate students on Friday and 
Saturday evenings from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
during the academic school year, not 
including summer, winter or spring breaks. 
Students are limited to one, one-way ride 
per evening within 10 miles of the campus. 

"We'chose to implement a safe rides pro-
gram," Conroy stated, "because it seemed 
like the most direct way to keep students 
who have been drinking out of their cars 
and provide them with an alternative to 
unsafe or uncomfortable situations." 

Conroy said the program will be expand-
ed and more utilities will be available next 
year.

Physicists Find Way to Detect Solar Disruptions' 
Researcher's create computer program to solve problems attributed to the disturbance phenomenon 

News Editor 

Physicists at UCSD and Japan's 
Nagaoya University have devel-
oped technology that will help 
space-wather forecasters predict 
solar disruptions on Earth. Solar 
disruptions can interrupt satellite 
communications, produce disrup-
tive surges in power grids and 
increase radiation exposure to air-
plane passengers. 

The technology consists of 
three-dimensional images of mag-
netic storms from the sun and 

, 

comes at a time when the sun is 
moving into the most active period 
of its 11-year cycle. 

Large magnetic storms are pro-
duced by energetic solar enlptions 
known as solar flares, which con-
sist of giant clouds of energetic 
electrons and strong magnetic 
fields traveling from the sun at up 
to 2 million mph. 

For years, space-weather fore-
casters issued warnings of these 
storms whenever they detected a 
solar flare near the sun. However, 
because they could not see the 
mass ejection traveling through 

space, they could not tell with any 
certainty whether it would affect 
the Earth when it arrived four days 
later, or whether it would totally 
bypass the planet. 

Bernard Jacksotl, a solar physi-
cist at UCSD'S' Center for 
Astrophysid and Space Sciences, 
said the new technology will dra-
matically improve the forecasting 
of solar flares. also known as coro-
nal mass ejections. 

"We are now at the stage where 
weather forecasting on global 
scales was 30 years a$o, when 
satellites first became available," he 

said. "We discovered then that we 
could see hurricanes really well 
from a satellite and could tell what 
direction they were going in and 
could watch them over time to 
predict where they were goi ng to 
make landfall. We're now at the 
same point with coronal mass 
ejections." 

The physicists have used a net-
work of four radio telescopes in 
Japan to develop a method of pre-
dicting the movements of geomag-
netic storms in the region between

Scam: 
Woman tries to convince 
students to give her a ride 
ContInued frHl ..... 1 
roo I to commit crime: O'Dell said. 
"Whether the child has any concept 
of what she is doing is wrong ... I 
don't have any idea: 

O'Dell said scams are uncom-
mon on campus, and he has not 
heard of a scam this sophisticated 
occurring. 

"This is the first time in all the 
years I've been here I can remember 
somebody fulling something like this 
off," O'oel said. 

The victim later learned from a 
male friend, also a UCSO student, 
that he was approached by a woman 
and child of similar description on 
May 15 around 5:45 p.m. in Lot 306. 
The woman told the male student the 
same Story about her child and her 
need for a ride. After the student 
refused to provide the ride, the 
woman asked for $11 each for bus 
fare. 

Police would not release the name 
of the studen ts. 

The student gave the woman $30 
and his phone number and address 
so that she could repay him. As of last 
Friday, he had not been repaid. 

O'Dell said he suspects it is the 
same person involved in both cases, 
although he has not heard of . any 
similar incidents in the San Diego 
area. 

"If she can't convince someone to 
get a ride, she panhandles," O'Dell 
said. 

O'Dell said the UCSO campus 
has probably been selected for this 
scam because it is an area where there 
are a lot of people during the day and 
a lot of movement. He added that 
scam artists may "target younger peo-
ple who would be more inclined to 
help somebody who was down on 
their lot." 

Anyone who is approached by 
someone of this description or who 
has information about this crime 
should comact O'Dell at UCSD 
Police by calling 534-4357. 
Emergency call boxes in parking lots 
may also be used.

Earth and the sun. By focusing the 
telescopes on powerful sources of 
natural radio emissions in the uni-
verse, the physicists can infer the 
location of these storms from the 
intensity fluctuations, or scintillation, 
that they produce in the radio 
sources. 

The scientists can detect the 
direction and velocity of the storms 
by measuring precisely when a partic-
ular fluctuation reaches each of the 
four telescopes. 

"If you have four radio telescopes 
not too far apart, then you can corre-
late the time the scintillation pattern 
goes from one telescope to the other," 
Jackson said. "That allows you to say 
how fast the material is moving: 

Combining all the information 
into a computer program, the scien-
tists produce a three-dimensional 
picture of the region between the sun 
and Earth. 

The information is then sent to 
the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration's Space 
Environment Center in Boulder, 
Colo., which provides forecasts and 
warnings of space-weather distur-
bances. 

Jackson added that the accuracy of 
the forecasts will once again improve 
dramatically when a U.S. Air Force 
satellite is launched in December 
2001, carrying an instrument that will 
take direct pictures of the mass ejec-
tions between the sun and the Earth. 

"We'll get a thousand times more 
data from the Solar Mass Ejection 
Imager and we'll be able to resolve 
these things by an order of a magni-
tude better," ,Jad§()n said.

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 

GrowingPai ns 
Loss of spots in the process of parking lot constructions at UCSD will exace:bate 

the current la:k of parking that plagues commuters and noncommuters alzke 
I, KIVIN IIID 
Senior Staff Writer 

Parking at UCSD has always been a 
nightmare. Students scour the parking 
lots daily looking for that rare empty 
spot. All the student spaces around die 
center of campus arc gone before mid-
morning, and many students become 
frustrated because they arc forced to 
park far from their classes. 

The problem has been compound-
ed during the current school year with 
the destruction of several lots to make 
way for the parking structures on 
North Torrey Pines Road and Gilman 
Drive. A new parking lot west of 
Regents Road was built to help offset 
the loss. This meant that parking 
became less convenient for many com-
muters. 

Parking will get even worse this fall . 
First, the faculty lot between Pacific 
Hall and Plaza Cafe will be destroyed 
to make room for the new Natural 
Sciences building. Second, construc-
tion of the new Roosevelt campus will 
begin on what is now North Parking. 
Finally, the opening of the North 
Torrey Pines parking structure has 
been delayed until February 2001 at 
least. 

At first glance, the destruction of 
the faculty lot between Plaza Cafe and 
Pacific Hall may not seem pertinent to 
students. The current plan, however, is 

to relocate all 149 "A" parking spaces 
to the lots south of Revelle College. 
This would displace many MS" spaces 
in that area. As a result, most of these 
spaces would be grabbed by Revelle 
residents. There will be little room for 
commuters who want to park ncar 
York Hall, Galbraith Hall or the dance 
studios. 

The North Torrey Pines parking 
structure was scheduled to open in the 
fall . Construction delays have pushed 
the opening to next winter quarter. 
Meanwhile, construction of the new 
Roosevelt campus in the fall will displace 
about 970 "S" sraces in North Parking. 

The origina plan was to have the 
opening of the North Torrey Pines 
parking structure coincide with the 
groundbreaking of the new campus. 
Because the structure is designed to 
hold about 970 spaces, it would have 
effectively been a net zero gain. Now, 
with the delay, there will be a major 
loss in the number of spaces in the 
north campus area. 

There will be more ·5· spaces creat-
ed before school starts in the fall . 
When the Gilman parking structure is 
completed in September, of the 860 
total spots, about 311 will be student 
spaces. In addition, another 212 ·5· 
spaces will be created in the Regents 
Road Lot. 

These additions, however, will not 
help commuters who want convenient 

parking. For one, residents will be 
allowed to park in the Gilman struc-
ture, and consequently. commuters 
will be forced to park elsewhere as 
well. The additions to the Regents 
Road Lot will just increase the capaci-
ty of an undesirable place to park. 

Thus, more comm\.\ters will be 
forced to find space in East Parking 
and the Regents Road Lot. Many stu-
dents hate parking in these lots, how-
ever. The only way to get to class from 
there is either to take a shuttle or hike. 
The shuttle is the first choice for many. 
but this can be frustrating. First. there 
are considerable delays between shut-
tles, and second, they tend to fill up so 
quickly during peak hours thlt many 
students are forced to wait in long lines 
for the next one. Most students are 
unwilling to take the mile-long hike tc/ 
the Price Center. Despite the wait, it 
,yould be faster for them to get to class 
if they continued to wait for the shut-
tle. I 

The A.S. Council has been working 
on a number of proposals to help alle-
viate parking difficulties. 

One controversial plan !woald ban 
all UCSD residents from ' parking on 
campus. Of course, there would be an 
appeals process for those residents 
who have off-campus-jobs responsit>iI-
ities.

Disastrous for Students

., DlVYA auNCIIAL 
Columnist 

The end of this academic year 
brings mt to tears: !Cars of joy. 
Thank God there will be no more 
tests, papers and mundane lectures 
by boring professors. Perhaps it . 
would not be wise for me to be so 
cynical. After all, some of my TAs 
might read this before grading my 
final exams. 

Maybe school isn't that bad. I 
mean, one-and-a-half-hour lec-
tures, indefinable paper assign-
ments and endless multiple-choice 
exams aren't the exact requisites of 
hell. However, they come pretty 
close. 

College was supposed to be dif-
krent. In my head, I pictured par-
ties, boys and endless days on the 
beach, in no particular order. So 
far, I have not gone to one party, 
met one boy or visited the sunny 
sl)o~s of La Jolla. If you I,aven't 
guessed already, I'm bitter. After 
reading every self-help book in the 
world, I've learned that bitterness 
getS you nowhere. It's always easy 
10 pity oneself, so I think they're 
selling a pretty unpopular concept. 

Anyway, after suddenly recalling 
Oprah's teachings, I realized I 
should focus on the positive things 
that have happened to me since I 
came here. OK, I'm done. 

I suppose you're asking yourself 
why all this matters. Who cares what 
an 18-yeaN>1d brat like me - y.'ho 
has tripped down more stairs and 
has had purses and backt>3c1ts spill 
more contents onto Library Walk 
than anyone else - really feels? 
Judging that my mother is my oniy 
known fan, someone - very per-

sona! to me - cares a great deal. 
I realize that there are many indi-

viduals out there who are quite 
happy with their first-year experi-
ences in college. If so. thanks a lot. I 
wish you could have been there 
when I failed a psycholoiY exam 
that the rest of my class acea. I wish 
you were there when a boy called 
me a fat placypus (OK. he didn't say 
that, but he did say I was unattrac-
tive in not so many words). I wish 
you were there when I bungled up 
an interview by saying I didn't think 
I was the best penon for the job (I 
was uying to be humble, abi~ht?). 

You're probably thinking, 
MDivya, you idiot. tum lemons into 
juice: or whatcYCr that phrase is. 
Even worse. perhaps you're think-
ing I really am a fal platypus (I 
would like to inform you, dear read-
er, that my mother thinks I'm gor-
geous). 

You may be thinking many 
things. but I want to assure you 
that I'm jealous - extremely jeal-
ous - of your happiness. I'm aware 
that this column may offend read-
ers for its anack on the quality of 
freshman year. Perhaps there actu-
ally may be ont or two people who 
actually relale to it or (gasp) enjoy it 
(sony, Mom, but you don't count). 
To those (no individuals who have 
suffered the unlucky Jate of circling 
the parking lot like greedy vultures 
for five hours looking for one 
space, who always discovered that 
the one book they needed from the 
thousands at Geisel Library was 
checked out, who dragged toilet 
paper unsuspectingly all over cam-
pus, who tripped on tree branches 
in front of their crush, this column 
is for you. Let's hope that next year 

I never thought I would be 
writing this column four years 
ago. It seems as if everyone 
always wants to write a farewell 
piece and dispense advice in 
some way to future generations. 
What's the point? What makes 
my words more meaningful than 
somebody tlse's? The answer is, 
nothing. That is why the most 
important thing I have realiztd in 
four years is that everyone has 
something gooo to offer and it's 
up to you to listen, learn and 
prosper from the opportunity of 
being around such diverse peo-
ple. 

A second realization is there is 
more to life than what happens at 
UCSD. There is an entire city 
around us, and it is beautiful -
with oceans, mountains and 
sprawling cliffs. Tht view from 
Torrey Pines Gliderport over-
looking Black's Beach is unparal-
leled. Go there with a good book 
and watch the majestic waves and 
the sunset. Venture up Mount 
Soledad in Pacific Beach and 
savor the breathtaking view. It is 
slightly better than what you sec 
from the sixth floor of Geisel. 

The same thing applies to the 
news. Sometimes we get so 
wrapped up in our studies and 
relationships that we forget what 
is going on in the nation and 
world around us. Read the news-
paper, watch CNN or if you arc 
really low on free time, use the 
Internet. It has more productive 
uses than pornography and 
video games. 

Follow the issues that you are 
passionate about. Champion a

cause. Get involved. If you believe 
that gun violence is rampant and 
out of control in this country, let 
your voice be heard. If Y9u are 
upset about discrimination 
against gays and lesbians, go to a 
meeting, join a rally or even start 
one. There is no better time than 
now. Remember, youth is a pow-
erful, driving force in ollr society. 
Usc it to your advantage. 

Take a wide variety of classes. 
Better yet, if you have free time, 
just find a random class and sit in 
on it. You're bound to learn 
something. Take an at:ting class. 
It's fun, relaxing and offers the 
unique opportunity to put your-
self in another person's shoes. 
When dealing with people, as~ 
yourself how you would feel if 
you were that other person. This 
seems like common sense advice, 
but few people really exercise it . 

Exercise. Don't sit around .

Spe~ing of alcohol, take it in 
moderation, or better yet, not at 
all. OK, I sound like an adminis-
trator or a student health advo-
cate. I don't care. Alcohol ruins 
so many lives, and for the most 
part, it tastes like turpentine. 

Even worse is smoking. If I 
could say one thing - just onr 
thing - to every student entering 
UCSD and have them follow it, it 
would be never to start smoking. 
I've seen people hopelessly 
addicted, promising to quit every 
other week. I've seen people rav-
aged by second-hand smoke. 
which kills over 50,000 people 
per year. Please, don 't smoke. and 
boycott the General Store Co-op

Relationships tend 10 be the 
most dominant concern for 
most. They should be. I have nei-
ther great experience nor insight 
into the issue, but here's some-
thing I've come to believe: 
Whether it be a friend or a signif-
icant other, the key to making 
your relationship work is 10 over-
come selfishness. You have to be 
willing to give wholeheartedly 
without expecting anything in 
return. Do that . and if it 's the

Front Page Photo Did More for Racist Viewpoints Than for Tolerance 
Editor: 
I am very troubled that the pro-

fane racist comments decorating 
your front page on Tuesday. May 
30 were photographed on March 
10. I find it ridiculous that it would 
take so long for such a thing to be 
published. We are left with less 
than three weeks. induding dead 
week and finals week. to ponder 
the implications of what was sen-
sationally placed on your front 
page. After reading Jessica 
Scheppmann's review of campus 
policy and how people who receive 
nasty e-mails actually r~ them. I 
am convinced that your choice of 
front page photos has done more 
work for hate than the instigators 
themselves. I will reserve further 
comment with the hope that you 
will print my letter in yo~r fine 
publication.

HateM ....... Hav. 
No Place at UCSD 

Editor: 
The hate message depicted on 

the cover of this week's Guardian is 
a real eye catcher. As a person of 
Caucasian descent. I am embar-
rassed and utterly ashamed that 
this kind of ignorance still prevails. 

My hope is that upon seeing this 
exposed pu blicly. the coward that 
st"cretly thinks those thoughts is 
also ashamed. 

There is no room for that sort of 
rhetoric in an enlightened society. 
Every person has the unquestion-
able right to live on a day-to-day 
basis without fear. The presence 
and diversity of life on Earth is a 
phenomenon of cosmic rarity that 
is worthy of awe and respect. So. 
also. is the diversity amidst our own 
species. Life on Earth owes its very 
existence to the strength of its 
diversity. and it is this diversity that 
will ensure its future. 

To anyone reading this now. if 
you know someone that thinks that 
hate messages are funny or correct. 
tell them they are wrong. No good 
will come from the hatred of cow-
ards.

television news departments serve 
any interest other than that of pro-
ducing revenue for the stations' 
owners. 

They write "A station can deliv-
er quality news without compro-
mising monetary rtWard." If true. 
we in the San Diego area (and the 
rest of the country) have not wit-
nessed it. It is not just the accuracy 
of the stories presented that must 
be scrutinized. but which stories 
the station5 choose to air. 

Only stories that bleed outrage 
or invoke sympathy find their way 
onto the air. Anything that would 
take more than 30 seconds to 
explain is discarded in the fear that 
a viewer might start to get antsy 
and switch stations. Just listen to 
the stories on National Public 
Radio's news shows or watch pub-
lic television's "News Hour" to see 
what quality rtporting looks like. 

Accuracy, too, is shoved aside 
if it stands In the way of attracting 
a larger audience. 'tWice in the last 
year, the company that I work for 
part-time has been the subject of 
exposes on local newscasts. The 
first time they said we were run-
ning a house of prostitution in the 
Mission Hills neighborhood 
where we were located. Ju.st a few 
weeks ago, stations started report-
ing that we (a telephone compa-
nr) had diverted telephone calls 
directed to the mayor's office to a 
pornographic telephone line.

Both are outrageous lies. When 
we called the stations to explain 
the reality of the situation~. th~y 
weren't interested in hearmg It. 
After all, the truth wasn't verY 
exciting. One news editor even 
told the president of the company. 
"If we did interview you. we'd just 
edit the tape to make you look 
bad" 

The next time Denny, Gherini 
and Wiefel do their own investiga-
tive reponing, they should be care-
ful not to blindly believe what their 
sources tell them. Just because a 
local news director says he's doing 
a good job doesn't make it so. 
Apply some critical thinking. Do 
you really believe all these stations 
would be competing for news view-
ers if it were "not considered a 
profit generator-? 

The station owners are failing to 
fulfill the requirements of their 
broadcast licenses to serve the 
community and, in fact, arc doing 
a disservice. I know several people 
who now refuse to go out aher 
dark, for fear that they will be car-
jacked, ~ped or murdered. This 
irrational fear is based not on real-
ity, but on 'he gospel as delivered 
by those we "trust· - your local 
news anchor.

Parking: 
More improvements may 
alleviate parking crunch 

This idea may not be realistic. 
There is increasing opposition 
among the undergraduate colleges 
and many students living on cam-
pus. Among the consequences for 
residents are safety concerns, the 
limitation of public transporta-
tion's hours, schedule flexibility 
and areas to which they travel. 
Students will also have problems 
gettmg off campus at odd hours to 
get items like medicatioll . 

Other ideas seem more plausi-
ble. Increasing the number of 
shuttles running around campus 
would decrease the long lines and 
the time spent waiting for them. 
New shuttle routes to the grocery 
store or areas like Pacific Beach 
may discourage on-campus resi-
dents from bringing cars to cam-
pus. 

Increasing security around the 
parking lots and extending shuttle 
hours to 3a.m. or 4 a.m. could 
entice residents to remain parked 
in peripheral lots. Designating 
specific lots or spaces "for com-
muters only· would ensure park-
ing for students living off campus. 
Creating more carpool spaces 
would also encourage more Stu-
dents to buy carpool permits. 

There is also the "flex-passes· 
program. Special three-day stu-
dent permits would be available 
for Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday, and for Tuesday. Thursday 
and Friday. The cost of purchas-
ing these special perm irs would be 
less than normal "5· permits. Not 
only would they help reduce -Stu-
dents' expenses, but they would 
better distribute the parking bur-
den . 

Unfortunately. flex-passes are 
highly dependent on how classes 
arc scheduled during the quarter. 
Students must fit reqUired courses 
into their schedule. They may 
want to avoid terrible classes or 
horribk professors. Some stu-
dents' preferred classes could be 
full by the time they enroll. possi-
bly forcing them to take classes 
fivt" days per week. Depending on 
how the courses are scheduled. 
the costs of coming to campus 
only three days per week may out-
weigh the benefitS. 

Do not expect any of these 
ideas to help solve parking prob-
lems soon. It remains to be seen 
which plan. if any, could pass 
through the university bureaucra-
cy and be implemented by 
September. Even if the flex-passes 
become available in the fall, it 
might be too late for them to make 
an impact. Most students have 
already enrolled in classes, 
unaware of the prograrr.. Because 
many classes are already full . 
interested students would have to 
change classes all.at once for flex-
passes to be effective. 

Perhaps we have come to the 
point where all commuters have to 
seriously think about alternative 
means of transportation. It will be 
difficult to get all of the solo drivers 
out of their cars. However, after 
they have spent a few consecutive 
hours trying to find parking in the 
fall. alternative trarsportation may 
seem appealing enough to be a 
realistic option. The costs of trying 
to park on campus could increase 
so much that free bus stickers, car-
and vanpooling, bicycle commut-
ing and even walking could- be 
more beneficial. 

. Whatever happens. you can 
count on one thing: Parking here 
will always be a nightmare. Those 
seniors who will be graduating next 
week can breathe a sigh of relief. 
For those residents who will be 
moving off campus, be prepared for 
the hell that is UCSD parkins. 

If yOtS have other suggestions, 
please contact ASUC5D Senate 
Chairman Shana Thakur at 534-
5920.

Queen Breaks the Ice With Camilla Parker Bowles 

LONDON - In a noteworthy 
and unexpected warming of the 
coldest shoulder in the realm, 
Queen Elizabeth II this past week-
end met Camilla Parker Bowles. 
mistress to her son Charles, the 
prince of Wales, for the first time 
since their affair began. 

The get-together was at a 60th 
birthday party on Saturday for the 
exi led King Constantine of Greece 
at Charles' Highgrove estate in 
Gloucestershire. It ended an 
extended royal snub that had irri-
tated and dismayed the prince and 
complicated the choreographed 
efforts by his staff to gain gradual 
public acceptance of Parker 
Bowles as his consort and pos~ible 
queen. . 

Parker Bowles, who last saw the 
queen two decades ago, was 
reported by other djners to have 
made a low, formal curtsy. The two 

women then chatted briefly before 
the 100 guests tucked into a bar-
becue lunch. They were seated at 
different tables. 

For years the queen had let it 
be known that she disapproved of 
the liaison between the 51-year-

party attendance has . become an 
important measure of whether the 
sovertign's thumb is up or down. 
Parker Bowles was not Invited to a 
grand party planned this summer 
for Queen Elizabeth, the queen 
mother, who turns 100 on Aug. 4. 

While there is plenty of evidence that Charles 
wants to step out in public with Parker Bowles, 
there is little to suggest that he wants to walk 
her down the aisle.

For royal watchers. birthday-

Buckingham Palace let it be 
known that the queen accepted 
the invitation for Saturday's party 
knowing full well who had been 
invited. A palace spokesman com-
mented tersely Saturday night. 
"The queen attended a birthday 
party for King Constantine given 
by the prince of Wales at 

Highgrove this lunchtime. and 
Mrs. Parker Bowles was among the 
guests.-

While there is plenty of evi-
dence that Charles wants to step 
out in public with Parker Bowles, 
thert is little to suggest that he 
wants to walk her down the aisle. 
Members of his staff point to his 
statement at the time of his 
divorce that he would not remar-
ry. 

They also assert that Parker

Longevity Study Focuse. on Years of 'Healthy ute' 
UNITED NATIONS - The 

United States falls behind almost 
every coun try in Europe. as well as 
Canada. Australia and Israel. in 
what the World Health 
Orga nization calls "healthy life 
expectancy," according a report 
re leased Friday. 

With the repon, the organiza-
tion joins a trend toward measur-
ing life expectancy in a new way. 
fo r the firs t time factoring in the 
diseases and disabilities that are 
likely to rob people of a lifetime of 
good health. 

By th is adjusted measure. 
Japan leads the wor1d in healthy 
life expectancy, accord in~ to 
WHO, which is part of the 
United ations system. A 

Japanese ci tizen can expect to 
lead a life of 74.5 healthy years, it 
said. At the very bottom of the 

scale is battered Siem Leone. 
where a child born in 1999 can 
expect to live a healthy life of 
fewer than 26 years. 

Almost every countJy with a 
healthy life expectancy below 40 is 
in Africa. where AIDS and warfare 

ties in richer nations.

Using traditional methods. 

average life expectancy in the 
United States was 76.7 years in 
1998, Haub said. with men at 73.9 
years and women at 79.4. 

The World Health 

Organization table of healthy life 
expectancy lowers the level to 70 
years for Americans overall, with 
67.5 yean for men and 72.6 years 
for women. 

The World Health 
Orlanization survey does not deal 
witlt perceptions. but does include 
projections based on what is 
known about major health factors 
like heart disease or lung cancer 
related to smoking. 

China, the world's most popu-
lous nation, with one-fifth of the 
world's people, was found to have 
a healthy life expectancy of 62.3, 
well ahead of the second-largest 
countJy, India, at 53:2. China out-
ranks not only India in a healthier 
life but also Russia.

of interviews with many prisoners 
who said they had been abused. It 
also includes lhotos of torture 
equipment an Roor plans that 
show where torture cells are sup-
posedly located in various police 
stations. No report by a government 
group has ever been this graphic. 

Committee members and inveS-
tigators interviewed more than 
8.500 prisonen over two yean. 
They conducted unannounced vis-
its to 50 priSOIU and two dozen 
police stations. said the vice chair-
man, Scbgetullah Scydaoglu. 

On Monday, committee mem-
bers presented the ~n to the 
minister of justice, Hlmet Sami 
Thrk. Afterward he said the report 
would "hold up a light for us. • 

"Torture is a crime against 
humanity: Thrk said. "Thrkey will 
resolve this issue. No country can 
justify torture on the grounds that 
other countries practice it. Claims 
of torture will be followed up with 
resolve. Torture has never been and 
never will be state policy." 

The repon says that when 
inmates of Istanbul's main 
women's prison were interviewed. 
"all recounted details of the tonure 
and abuse they suffered.· Most 
prisoners intcmewed at jails in the 
eastern cities of Sanliurfa. Erzurum 
and Erzincan told similar stories. 

"This report says what we have 
been saying for years. that torture is 
extensive and systematic in 
Turkey: said Nazmi Gur. chairman 
of the Human Rights Association . 

"People are happy with the per-
formance of the police. - the deputy 
interior minister, Sami Son rna, 
asserted at a parliamentary hearing 
last year. "The police are capable of 
extracting confessions from the 
culprits. What's the use of creating 
a lot of fuss as long as public opan-

HINDMAN. Ky. - Call it green

countless hidden marijuana patch-
es now stippling the spring time 
"hollen" of Appalachia the way 
moonshine stills used to when 
Sheriff Wheeler jacobs was a boy. 

"Moonshine's a lost an around 
here. - said jacobs. driving up a bad 
road near Yellow Mountain. a 
remote area he has watched blos-
som as a cornucopia of marijuana. 

"Moonshine went out in the 
late 70s. just when marijuana start-
ed big around here." 

As the sheriff wheeled about his 
domain recently, he could think of 
only two tired old moonshiners left 
in these hills, in contrast to the 54 
youthful " holler dopers" arrested 

during the last two years here in 
Knott County alone. 

The back-road yield of illegal 
marijuana has proliferated so much 
that federal officials have designated 
65 Appalachian counties here and in 
West Virginia and Tennessee as a 
"high intensity drug traffiding 
area.· 

This region is estimated to sup-
ply two-fifths of the nation's sup-
ply. Since the region has been tar-
get by drug enforcement measures, 
more than 1.900 arrests have been 
made and 5.000 patches of mari-
juana have been uprooted . . 

The federal help means that 
National Guard helicopters have 
already swept through on their 
spring reconnaissance of the most 

remote marijuana patches. It means 
that Jacobs has the overtime money 
to put his four deputies out on the 
hillsides alongside state troopers 
this summer for the rugged work of 
cuning and burning. 

The sheriff and state troopers are 
regional leaders in arresting mari-
juana growers and destroying their 
crops. and are appreciated in this 
coal mining county of 18,000, said 
Charlone Hicks Caudill, a reporter 
for The Troublesome Creek Times. 

A sman grower nowadays tills

and the third for his competitors to

"(Thton Taxi( ran flawlessly the first 
year. It's been a success because we 
have been strict about it." 

Khullar explained that initially 
there were liability issues with the 
\lniversity, but the A.S. Council was 
able to curb the issue by making 
students register before using the 
program. Students must sign an 
Identification clause on a liability 
waiver so neither A.S. Council nor 
UCSD can be held responsible for 
the student.

Some students follow fash-ion trends to project an identity and carve out their niche. Others take more permanent measures to 
convey their personalities, 

such as tattooing and body piercing. 
Although these more extreme mea-
sures seem almost commonplace in 
our generation, tattooing and piercing 
have a long history. 

' ....... Tattooing originated in ancient 
Egypt between 4000 B.C. and 2000 
B.C. By 2000 B.C., the an form had 
spread across the Mediterranean, 
Southern Asia and pans of China. 
The Ainu, who came from Western 
Asia, believed it to be a divine gift. 
Adopting it from the Ainu, the 
Japanese used the an form for orna-
mentation. 

Tattoos have a historically ceremo-
nial. as well as decorative, purpose. 
Polynesians in New Zealand devel-
oped a style of tattooing called 
"moko; which was used in cere-
monies to indicate tribal community, 
family, rank or marital status. 

Ceremonial tattooing spread to the 
West with the Gauls and later the 

No~mans. A custom was developed 
among warriors to indicate heredity. 
Distinguished pilgrims who had trav-
eled to Jerusalem got tattoos as a 
reminder of their journey.

So, what would motivate members 
of our age group to alter their appear-
a!\ce in lasting ways? 

Many colrege students decide to 
change their physical appearance to 
demonstrate their commitment to an 
idea, whether it be a sense of inde-
pendence, personal fashion or spiri-
tuality. 

Third-year student Annemieke 
Delange chose to get a tattoo of a 
Japanese symbol signifying love - an 
idea she values. Derange had th~ piece 
done on her upper shoulder in San 
Francisco several years ago. She 
affirms identifying with the symbol, 
but knows that certain peers remain 
skeptical. 

"My boyfriend thinks the only rea-
son [ got it was because of my [previ-
ousl boyfriend; Delange said. 

She has considered covering it up 
with another tattoo because removal 
costs too much. 

Delange has not experienced any 
problems due to her tattoo, despite her 
mother's initial disappointment in see-
ing it. 

"No one said anything; Delange 
said.

For sophomore Nhat Le, the 30 

minutes of pain for a two-inch sun 
was well wonh it. She said getting a 
tattoo was something she had always 
wanted to do. 

"It is a symbol of independence and 
of knowing yourself," Lc said. 

Although hidden on her lower back 
(away from her parents' critical eyes), 
the sun tattoo also serves as a symbol 
offamily pride for her and her cousins. 
Four of her cousins had the same 
design done in different colors before 
motivating Le to also get one. 
Committed to this single emblem of 
cousinhood, Le has no desire to fur-

toos or piercings.

For example, whenever he visits a spe-

The Editor's Soapbox 
An incoming editor in chief recounts his rise to the top of the Guardilln, reliving both good and bad times 
News Editor 

A little over three years ago, [ 
wandered into the Guardian office 
(truly a strange sight to soineone 
unfamiliar with us). At the time, I 
was still in high school. [ didn't 
know what college [ wanted to 
attend, and a friend of mine who 
used to work for the GuardUm gra-
ciously gave me a tour of UCSD. I 
knew at the time that I wanted to 
enter the field of journalism in 
some facet or another. What I did-
n't know, however, is that the office 
that [ was so briefly exposed to 
would soon become my home 
away from home. Or just simply, 
my home. 

Next year, [ will assume the role 
of editor in chief. With the help of 
a competent staff, [ will continue to 
crank out issue after issue, staying 

. in the office until one, two or even 
3 a.m., ensuring each one is com-
plete. (Please, people, don't walk 
past our offices at 3 a.m. and stare 
at us as if we are pan of a freak 
show or something. We're really 
just doing our jobs.) 

My election to the position of 
editor in chief was pretty straight-
forward (my only competition was 
an application from ·Common 
Sense" author Thomas Paine ... it's 
a long story). The road to the posi-

tion, however, was long and cir-' 
cuitous. 

Once [ finally decided to attend 
UCSD, [ made it a point to visit 
the Gruzrdian, hoping [ could be a 
writer. [ was told that my friend 
who worked for the Guardian, the 
one who brought me into the 
office months earlier, was no 
longer employed there. 

Lost and confused, [ made 
every attempt to contact the news 
editors. Once I finally did, I was 
given my first assignment. [t was a 
rather boring assignment (as most 
first assignments are) that ended 
in a slight disaster. 

I attended an e\'ent that con-
sisted of a panel of speakers. As 
the event got staned, the organiz-
ers said that all comments made 
by the speakers, were off the 
record. My enthusiasm for the 
story diminished; I didn't know 
where to start. [n the end, [ turned 
in a three-paragraph story. [ am 
sure my editors weren't too happy 
with me. 

[ persisted by constantly asking 
them if [ could write more. They 
put me off, perIY..ps trying to tell 
me that they C;idn't want to deal 
with my writing. My persistence 
paid off, however, and before the 
end of the year, I was writing more 
and more. 

The following year, [ returned 
. 

One joy about working 
for the Guardian is that 
everyone is there because 
they want to be there. Our

own beat. It was actually by acci-
dent that [ was asked to cover an 
A.S. Council meeting. One meet-
ing turned into two meetings, 
which turned into a year full of 
meetings. As a result, [ wrote at 
least one anicle a week for the 
GuardUm and was top on the list (or 

near the top) to become the next 
news editor . 

[ took that position last fall and 
immediately became stressed out. 
On my first production day as news 
editor, [ arrived at the office at 9 
a.m., supposedly getting an early 
stan. [ planned to finish 14 hours 
later at 11 :30 p.m. 

That deadline came and went, 
and we worked through the night) 
didn't leave until 7 a.m. the next 
morning, 22 hours after coming 
into the office. 

After about a month of being 
newS editor, [ had this brief notion 
that [ should stan lookin$ for 
another career. Finding story Ideas, 
finding photo ideas and spending 
an average of 12 to 14 hours in the 
office on a production day all 
taught me that perhaps [ didn't 
want to work for a newspaper. My 
job included responsibilities that 
wouldn't leave me when [ left the 
office. I walked around with a bur-
den on my shoulder. Surely jour-
nalism wasn 't for me. 

The bitterness subsided after a 
very short time, however. [ soon 
realized that after a few months of 
working in my position, my job 
actually became easier. 

More imponantly, when each 
production night was finished , [ 
could pick up the issue the next 
day and look at it,with pride. rea liz-

ing that so many people had put so 
many hours into creating a product 
we were pleased with . I think that 
such pride is what keeps people in 
journalism. It cenainly made me 
realize that perhaps I do want to 
work as either a writer or an editor 
once [ am through with college. 

One joy about working for the 
Guardian is that everyone is there 
because they want to be there ur 
paychecks show clearly that we are 
not doing this job for the money. 
We are doing this because we 
enJoy it. Each editor. wnter, 
designer. etc. has a genuine inter-
est in learning something about 
journalism and producing some-
thing for readers. 

With this in mind, [ look for-
ward to next year. Readers should 
too, because as each year pas es, 
the Guardian grows more. 
Knowledge accumulated by editors 
who have been around for four or 
five years will now be passed on to 
those of us assuming power I 
believe we have improved our qual-
ity this year, and I hope to continue 
the positive trend. 

If you think you can help me do 
so in any way (advice, suggestions, 
interest in writing for us, etc.). 
please drop me an e-mail at vgrag-
nani@ucsd.edu 

Thank you, and we'll see you 
next year. 

The last issue of the Guardian is coming on Thursday. You know you want some.

Staff Writer 

The most imponant test during 
finals week this quaner will not be 
given in a lecture hall. This finals 
week, UCSD students have been 
challenged to till the barrels at all five 
colleges with food and clothes for the 
hungry and poor of San Diego. 

From June 9 to June 15. the 
California Student Public Interest 
Research Group and the San Diego 
Food Bank will be hosting an all-
campus food and cloth ins drive to 
benefit thousands of famihes in San 
Diego. Combining CalPIRG's effons 
with the organization and experience 
of the San Diego Food Bank, the 
finals week drive will give students 
an opponunity to help out the com-
munity in a big way. Instead of 
throwmg away items they do not 
want to take home this summer. stu-
dents can donate to families who 
suffer from hunger and poveny all 
year. 

CalPIRG members are eagerly 
awaiting the upcoming food drive. 

"This finals week food drive is a 
simple way for the community to 
come together: freshman Alison 
Bodenstab said. ·We have so much to 
give - we're such a community of 
excess. This food drive is a good way 
for people to become involved." 

The food and clothing drive is just 
one of the many projects that the 
Hunger and Homelessness branch of 
CalprRG organizes at a local level. 
Headed by Tala Abassi, the Hunger 
and Homelessness branch works to 
benefit the San Diego community 
through education, service and 
action - goals synonymous with 
those of the San Diego Food Bank. It 

was natural that these two would 
team up for a food and clothing drive 
during finals week. 

Barrels donated by the San Diego 
Food Bank will be placed at locations 
all over campus. With the exception 
of Warren, every location will have 
separate barrels for nonperishable 
food items and clothing items. 

Because neither CalPIRG nor the 
San Diego Food Bank previously 
have attempted a finals week food 
drive, each is hopeful for a successful 
drive and excited to see the outcome 

CalPIRG is about more 
than just the environment. 
As a statewide public 
interest group, CalPIRG 
tackles a wide s~ctrum of 
issues -from ATM 
surcharges to deforestatWn 
- often unnoticed by the 
general student populatWn. 
of this all-campus event. 

"With this drive. we hope that we 
can remind everyone that the hungry 
need food all year round - not JUSt 
during the holidays: San Diego 
Public Relations Manager Teresa 
Leader-Anderson said. 

Abassi joins Leader-Anderson in 
her excitement. 

"The combination of our two 
groups will be great because we're 
combining their vast . resources -
trucks, pick-up systems. methods of 
distribution, etc. - with CaIPIRG's 
campus kno*led8C and energy: 
Abassi said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

The beneficiaries of the donations 
'will be Goodwill for all nonfood 
items, and the San Diego Food Bank 
for all food donated by UCSD stu-
dents. 

"All the food we collect in June 
will benefit our Senior Brown Bag 
program - which serves more than 
1,000 seniors countywide - and our 
shopping warehouse, which distrib-
utes to over 300 'other non profits 
around the county,' Leader-
Anderson said. uThe San Diego Food 
Bank distributes enough food for 
more than 20.000 mea!. every day of 
the year." 

As an affiliate of America's Second 
Harvest national food bank network. 
the San Diego Food Bank receives 
and distributes donations from 
national corporations such as 
NabiSCO and Kellogg's. It also pro-
vides warehouse space for smaller. 
local shelters that cannot store all of 
the food they collect. 

CalPIRG member Joanna Chang 
invites people to take the time to 
donate during finals week. 

Ult's a great way of reaching out to 
the community," she said. "You want 
to give to people who are hardwork-
ing. If you have extra meal pOints. go 
to Earl's Place to get a can. Helping 
out is a reward in itself." 

As a statewide public interest 
group, CalPIRG tackles a spectrum of 
issues from ATM surcharges to 
deforestation. 

UCSD CalPIRG is a local chapter 
of a statewide organization founded 
in 1976. There are chapters of 
CalPIRG at seven UC schools. 

The UC Regents do not currently 
give the organization any finanCially

ArIes (March 21·April19r 
You are intelligent again this week. 

Romance looks good from Monday 
through Wednesday. On Thursday and 
Friday, work hard to make up for the time 
you have missed. Go along with what your 
partner suggests over the weekend. It is 
not easy for you, but it is possible. Your 
playmate will love it. 

, ...... (April 2o.May 20) 
You are looking for new ways to make 

money, and you are creative. Get what you 
need for your home from Monday 
through Wednesday. Show off your tal-
ents, as well as your shrewd shopping abil-
ity. On Thursday, you may be finishing a 
project, and you might not have much 
time for romance. Schedule that for Friday, 
starting as early as possible. Put the finish-
ing touches on your project over the 
weekend, and then relax and soak up the 
applause. 

...... (May 21·June 21) 
You are learning quickly this week. 

Soak up the new material on Monday and 
Tuesday. Move slowly on Wednesday, 
though. Something you are trying may not 

work as well as you expected. That is part 
of the learning process. More complica-
tions arise on Thursday, but by Friday you 
should have everything under control. 
Then you will have plenty of time and lots 
of confidence when you meet your sweet-
heart this weekend. Plan the most roman-
tic interlude you can imagine. 

c- (June 22·July 22) 
You might be worried this week. Talk 

with a good friend , and you will be reas-
sured. From Monday through Wednesday, 
you are sharp with business. You could 
make an awesome deal then, so watch for 
the chance. Do not believe gossip you hear 
on Thursday; check it out. On Friday a 
conllict arises, but it should work out well 
for you. Make time for a hean-to-heart 
conversation this weekend. 

LM (July 2~Aug. 22) 
You are obviously the best person for 

the leadership position, especially on 
Monday and Tuesday. You could run into 
a little trouble on Thursday, but nothing 
you cannot handle. Show respect, and you 
will get it back. Count your pennies on 
Friday so you can afford to do something 
educaticnal over the weekend. 

VIrIe (Aug. 2~Sept. 22) 
You have opportunities again this 

week. Watch for them. You are under pres-
sure from Monday through Wednesday. 
Think it over by yourself, and you will 
reach the wisest decision. On Thursday be 
persistent If others will not do what you 
want. By Friday, you should be successful. 
Ask for money if you need it over the 
weekend, and then get yourself a treat. 

..... (Sept. 2~Oct. 23) 
Your luck should hold again this week. 

You are popular from Monday through 
mid-Wednesday. Do not exhaust yourself 
because Wednesday afternoon or

Tattoo: 
Piercings are another way 
to ornament the body 

"You always have to consider 
yourself an artist before anything, 
because your reputation is walk-
ing around - it's on someone's 
skin: Wyatt said. 

He said this is the reason he 
refuses to create racist, hate-ori-
ented designs. 
l'IIttoGI ........ 

The actual tattooing process 
occurs in three steps. First, the 
artist designs a stencil based on 
the pattern chosen. Then, he cre-
ates an outline of the pattern in 
black. Finally, he fills in the colors 
from darkest to lightest. 

Big City Tanoo Co. charges a 
minimum of $40 per piece in 
addition to Salinaz's rate of $100 
per hour. An average-size tattoo 
costs between $80 and $160. 

The perception of pain experi-
enced in the process varies from 
person to person. Le described 
her experience as "a painful, con-
stant poking and digging into the 
skin. - . 

Salinaz described the feeling of 
getting a tattoo as uncomfortable. 

"There's a lot of discomfort 
involved rather than pain: Salinaz 
said. "The pain feels like someone 
scratching you when you have a 
bad sunburn." 

According to Wyan, women 
have their ankle or lower back tat-
tooed with a bunerfly. He also said 
that men tend to get bands 
around their biceps, dragons or 
m"nsters. The fetus Wyan has tat-
tooed on his right ann is a ·sym~ 

bol of a mistake I had made." 
........ 

Because they are less perma-
nent, body piercings, unlike tat-
.toos, tend to be less symbolic and 
more like fashion statements. 
Both types of ornamentation, 
however, serve as expressions of 
people's personalities or their 
desire for individllality. 

According to 
www.sapositivt.com. ear piercing 
is one of the oldest forms of 
piercing. It originated in pre-

More visible piercings, 
found on the tongue, 
eyebrow, nose, ears and 
lips, make a statement of

audience, 
industrial societies as a ritual to 
mark the life stages of an individ-
ual or to signify group affiliation. 
Most upperbody piercings ori~i­
nated in pre-industrial societies 
and were symbols of pride and 
status. 
..... ..... ., .... 

Professional body piercer 
Jenifer Yahner, also an employee 
of Tattoo Ink Spot, recommends 
cleaning new piercings two or 
three times per day for the first 
few weeks no maner what area 
one chooses to pierce. 

According to Yahner, summer 
is the most popular time for pierc-
ing because people tend to be on 
vacation or away from home. 

Hoops, bars lind gemmed bar-
bells are the most popular jewelry 
for piercings, according to Yahner. 

The UCSD Guardian 

She feels that naval and tongue 
piercings, followed by nipple 
piercings, are the most popular 
areas of ornamentation among 
women. The most painful areas 
for piercing are the nipples and 
cartilage. 

Genital piercings are more 
popular for males than for females 
because there -are more places to 
pierce on men. Ornamentation on 
the genitals usually serves as a less 
visible fashion statement. Genital 
piercing, however, can become 
more easily infected if one does 
not take proper care, Yahner 
warned.

More visible piercings, found 
on the tongue, eyebrow, nose, ears 
and lips, make a statement of per-
sonal style 10 a wider audience. 
Nicole Guiang decided on her 
first body piercing at age 15, when 
she was walking the streets of 
Toronto, her hometown. 

"My friend wanted to get her 
belly button pierced, after which I 
decided I wanted to get my tongue 
pierced,- Guiang said. 

Her friend decided tongue 
piercing was a good idea and 
changed her original plan. At age 
18, Guiang had a loop placed 
through the septum of her nose. 
Her latest piercings are two studs 
placed symmetrically in her upper 
lip. 

Guiang asserts that her parents 
did not mind her piercings and 
actually enjoy showing off her and 
her brother to friends. She does 
not claim to be stating her indi-
viduality or independence 
through her piercings. 

"I don't do it for anything spir-
itual," Guiang said. "I do it (or the 
pure aesthetics." .

"People have this perception 
that we're only tree huggers, but 
our group does so much more: 
sophomore Abassi, chair of the 
Hunger and Homelessness 
Campaign, said. "We aren't only 
about the environment. We work 
on hunger and homelessness 
issues, banning ATM surcharges 
and increasing federal aid for stu-
dents. Our hunger clean-up this 
spring raised over $1,500 for 
homeless shelters." 

According to the new chapter 
chair Nadia Balici, UCSD will see 

CalPIRG continue the environment, 
CalPIRG steps in. 

CalPIRG's mis-
sion is to serve and 
protect the public 
interest in 
Sacramento on a 
variety of ' issues, 
such as zero-emis-
sion vehicles, 
genetically engi-
neered food label-
ing and pre-testing, 

As pieces of a larger 
organization, each 
chapter is geared 
towards making a 
difference on both 
local and state 

to tackle tough 
issues next fall.

Noah Greer, UCSD CalPIRG 
chapter chair for the 1999-2000 
school year, feels the group has 
great influence in the capital. 

·CaIPIRG is well recognized 
within the state legislature as a 
statewide, grassroots, organizing 
force that tackles issues of stu-
dents' rights, higher education and 
environmental issues, among oth-
ers: Greer said. 

CalPIRG works on- a myriad of 
issues that it feels will impact 

campaign and we 
will be working 

with A.S. [Council[ on a voter reg-
istration drive in the eady fall," 
Balici said . 

CalPIRG awaits the outcome of 
the finals week food and clothing 
drive that will distribute the pro-
ceeds in the San Diego communi-
ty. Perhaps this event will change 
the perception at UCSD that 
CalPIRG is just an environmental 
group. 

"This is great for kids during 
finals week because it's simple -
there's no work: Abassi said. 
"Instead of throwing that ca n of 
tuna in the trash can, you can take 
it to a barrel outside your apart-

Follow These Easy Steps for a Perfect Summer Bash 
By following several basic rules, even the most virgin of party throwers can rise to greatness with a good party 
.,JOIII_ 
Associate Features Editor 

The temperature is risiriS, 
School is almost out. Summer IS 
upon us. That can mean only one 
thing: It·s time to party. 

as the party master. Many people 
may not be happy with this rule, 
but it is one of the most important 
ones. Many parties have gone 
awry due to a drunken host disre-
garding the rules and not moni-
toring the house. 

The second rule is that there 
must be sectioned areas for various 
aspects of the party. There must be 
specific areas for sex, smoking, 
"ing to the bathroom and dispos-
tng of trash. The last thing a host 

sex. 
With these most basic rules in 

place. the next task for the party 
thrower is to decide what kind of 

pa~ he or she wants. This infor-
mation can be directly applied to 
rules regarding the number of 
people and the type of people 
allowed into the party. Hosts can 
choose to have anything from a 
small gathering of close friends to 
a gigantic bash with total 
strangers. While the latter will 

liquor, as they can be mixed easily 
with common beverages to make a 
tasty treat that all party-goers will 
enjoy. 

Music is also an important 
aspect of a suc.cessful party. 
Depending on the crowd, different 
types of music may be appropriate. 
The most important thing to keep 
in mind is that the music should be 
upbeat. Slow, sentimental songs do 
nothing but kill an otherwise 
happy mood for many party-goers. 

Everybody who· is anybody 
wants to throw a party at some 
point during the summer. He or 
she plans the party meticulously. 
praying to the party gods to make it 
the best bash of the summer. 
Inevitably, something goes wrong. 
Be it police involvement or the 
shattering of mom's priceless vase. 
Murphy's Law is always in full 
effect when there is a pany 
involved. 

The last thing that a host wants is to find people having sex on the kitchen table 
next to a pile of empty beer bottles, cigarette butts and feces. The areas must be 
cltarry marked and strictly enforced. 

make sure the police do not arrive 
(at least not until later in the 
evening) . Many excellent parties 
have been stymied due to prema-
ture police involvement. The best 
method of keepihg the authorities 
at bay is to consult one's neigh-
bors before the big bash. Let them 
know that there will be a party 
and direct them to contact you if 
they have a complaint. This way, 
you will at least get a warning 
when your neighbors become 
upset. 

Well , there it is. The party 
thrower's guide to hosting the 
perfect summer bash. Just by pay-
ing attention to a few minor 
details. an otherwise doomed 
party can be directed to salvation. 
Hallelujah! 

Fear not, faithful party throwers, 
for there is hope. By following a few 
simple party rules. chaos and may-
hem can be easily reduced to minor 
party casualties. 

The most important thing to do 
before throwing a par1¥ is to set 
rules. Wltile nobody likes a party 
pooper, people will understand that 
rules must be made in order to 
ensure that the structural integrity 
of the house remains for the dura-
tion of the evening. 

First on the list of rules is that 
the person throwing the party 
must not get drunk. A slight feel-
ing of intoxication is allowed, but 
the host must function in his role 

wants is to find people having sex 
on the kitchen table next to a pile 
of empty beer bottles, cigarette 
buns and feces. The areas must be 
clearly marked a nd strictly 
enforced. 

A good host also will not forget 
the sacred rule of privacy. A por-
tion of the house (usually the 
host's bedroom) should be 
blocked off to preserve some level 
of privacy for the host. This area 
can be used for the storage of 
valuable objects from around the 
house as well IS a place to talk to 
a member (or members, if it is a 
really good party) of the opposite

earn the host a higher social rank-
ing, it may also .lead to more trou-
ble, due to the simple fact that 
total strangers have no regard for 
another stranger's belongings. It 
takes strict adherence to the previ-
ous rules in order to pull off a suc-
cessfu I, large-scale party. 

With the rules and guest list 
established, the all-important 
aspect of alcohol must be 
addressed. While urgin~ people to 
bring their own booze IS an excel-
lent policy, having some alcohol on 
hand, especially hard liquor, is a 
good idea. Rum, tequila and vodka

Popular forms of party music 
include rap, hip hop, techno, alter-

In order to appease the drunks, 
some sort of entertainment should 
also be available at the party.

range from supplying a deck of

Men's and Women's Tennis Teams Lose Five Seniors 
Mike Rosett leaves the men's team, and Yen- Yen Ho, Becky Jones, Kelli Tsai and LindSay Witmer depart the women's squad 
By BILL IUHIII 
Sports Editor 

With the 1999-2000 school year 
winding down , UCS D coaches will 
soon have to say goodbye to their 
senior players who have served 
them so well in recent years. The 
men's and women's tennis coaches 
are no exception ; both are losing 
integral parts of their squads. 

The men 's tennis team changed 
coaches two years ago and went 
through a rebuilding year last sea-
son. This year, Head Coach Eric 
Steidl mayer's team had a resur-
gence in its form and came only 
one win away from a berth in the 

CAA ational Championship 
Tournament. Much of that -turn-
around can be credited to the play 
of senior Mike Rosetl. 

Rosen was the team captain this 
season and also one of its most 
consistent performers. In a season 
filkd with turmoil and upheaval, 
Rosett was one of the anchors that 
held the Tritons steady. 

For most of the season, Rosett 
played at the o. 1 doubles spot 
with teammate Corey Moderhak. 
Rosen and Moderhak were truly a 
force, competing and beating many 
of the top doubles teams in 
Division Ill. One of their most 
impressive performances came in 
defeat, when the duo took Brigham 
Young University's top doubles 
team, a powerhouse that was 
ranked in the top 15 in the nation 
in Division I, to a tie-breaker before 
losing. 

Even after Moderhak was 
declared ineligible for academic rea-
sons. Rosen played well in doubles 
with various partners. amassing a 
record of 10-7 in doubles play. 

Although Rosen's record in sin-

gles, 3-11, was not as strong, many 
of his defeats came at the hands of 
some of the top singles players in 
Division Ill. With the ousting of 
Moderhak, the team's No.2 singles 
player, and with No. 1 Michael 
Meyer injured, Roset! and junior 
Dan Albrecht shouldered much of 
the load during the late part of the 
season. Rosen's ability and leader-
ship will definitely be missed. 

The women's tennis team was 
one of UCSD's best squads this 
season. While amassing a 20-3 
record, the women's tennis team 
came only one set short of winning 
its fifth National Championship 
under the guidance of Head Coach 
Liz LaPlante. LaPlante is losing 
four seniors who helped her team 
reach the levels it did this season. 

Kelli Tsai was an important part 
of the team her first two seasons 
but sat out her junior year. 

"Kelli got a concussion and did-
n't play for us last season; 
LaPlante said. "She made a come-
back this year and played at o. 3 
doubles for a lot of the year: 

Tsai totalled an impressive 7-2 
record in doubles and a 4-1 record 
in singles for the Tritons this sea-
son. After graduation, Tsai hopes 
to go to culinary school. 

Lindsay Witmer played all four 
years for LaPlante and was the 
team 's Triton Athletic Council rep-
resentative and team captain. 

·She always supported our 
team; laPlante said. "She orga-
nized everything that we did socially 
and was one of our team's leaders." 

Witmer won the only match she 
played this season and volunte~rs 
with AIDS patients in her spare time. 

Becky Jones also played all four 
years during her career at UCSD 
and was one of LaPlante's most 

consistent players during that 
time. 

"Becky is a great person and a 
great team player: laPlante said. "I 
could always count on her" 

Jones played more in her first 
two seasons with the team but gra-
ciously stepped aside during her 
senior year when the team was 
making its run to the NCAA 
Division III Finals. After gradua-
tion, Jones hopes to go to medical 

school. 
The fourth senior to whom 

LaPlante will have to say goodbye 
this season is Yen-Yen Ho. Ho only 
played two years because of back 
su"ery she underwent after a car 
aCCIdent her senior year of high 
school. In those two years. Ho was 
one of laPlante's best players. 

"Yen-Ym was very mature for her 
age and was basically the mom of our 
team; LaPlante said. MShe is a great

player, and I hate to see her go: 
Ho's 14-8 record in singles and 

17-5 record in doubles were 
among the best on the team. Many 
of her wins came against the sec-

opposing squad. Next year, Ho will 
anend graduate school at USD. 

Much of laPlante's squad is 
returning next season. The team 
should perform well next year when 
the Thtons move up to Division 11.

Volleyball Stars Say Goodbye 
Earnest Yun and Raffi Mitillian leave UCSD with National Championship 
., ......... 
Sports Editor 

. One of the hardest things 
about coaching a college team is 
having to say goodbye to seniors. 
Every four years, a college coach 
can count on having a 100-per-
cent turnover of his players. This 
season, the seniors leaving the 
NCAA Division III National 
Champion men's volleyball team 
are Raffi Mitillian and Earnest 
Yun . 

Mitillian was primarily a back-
row player for the Tritons this sea-
son but made his mark on the 
team nonetheless. 

MRaffi was probably the tough-
est player I have ever coached: 
Larsen said. "He had bad knee 
problems but practiced through 
It. I think he was a very inspira-
tional player because the other 
guys would see him playing 
through pain." 

MitiUian's six aces this season 
were fifth on the team, as were his 
91 digs. Mitillian's contributions, 
howf\·er. could not be measured 
by statistics. His grit, guts and 
energy were what made Mitillian 
an irreplaceable factor on the 
team this season. His effort 
impressed Larsen. 

"He was alwa~ really ener-
getic; Larsen said. "He always 
went out ready to play and gave it 
everything he had." 

After graduation, Mitillian is 
going to travel around Europe 
before going into e-commerce.

Yun only played two seasons 
on the Triton volleyball team. 
Prior to that, he was playing intra-
mural volleyball and, on a whim, 
decided to try out for the team his 
junior year. Coach Ron Larsen 
should be thanking his lucky stars 
Yun did. 

At times Yun would put the 
team on his back and lead them to 
victory. 

"Ernie could be a dominating 
force at middle blocker this 
year; Larsen said. "He played 
especially well in the national 
tournament.W 

Yun was a monster in the 
middle for the Tritons this sea-
son. He went from lJeing a rela-
tive non-factor last year to being 

one of the Tritons' stars this sea-
son. His 195 kills placed him 
third on the team behind stars 
Zach Hite and Donald Chen. His 
.321 hitting percentage was the 
best on the squad, as was his 
1.244 average blocks per game. 
When the Tritons were in trou -
ble, they often went to Yun for a 
sure kill. 

Next year, when the men's 
volleyball team goes to Division 
II , the returning players and the 
recruits Larsen brings in should 
be in good shape to compete. In 
spite of all the ability returning to 
the team, it will be very difficult 
to replace everything Mitillian 
and Yun brought, day in and day 
out.

FOtXbIIHallo/F_ 

Now can we get rid 
of John Rocker? 
1y1llLL_ 

Yesterday I woke up and began 
my normal routine for a Sunday: I 
changed out of my c1oth~ that I 
fell asleep in the night before, 
threw away the beer bottles that 
were lying all over the family room, 
and went back to bed until the 
hangover went away. When I 
awoke, newly refreshed, I turned on 
the computer and went to ESP's 
Web site to check out what hap-
pened in sportS the previous night. 

I was troubled by what my eyes 
sa'\' when they looked at the page: 
our fnend John Rocker again mak-
109 an Idiot out of hImself. 

When last we spoke of Rocker, 
Sports Illustrated had just run a story 
about hIm 10 which he made racIst 
Ind bIgoted statements toward 
homosexuals, African Americans 
and basically anyone who lives 10 
the ew York area. 

Now, Jeff Pearlman, who ongi-
nally wrote the story about Ro ker's 
raCISt attitude, is accustng Rocker of 
maktng threats toward him when 
the twO ran tnto each other before a 
Yankees-Braves game last weekend. 
It was the tirst lime the two had 
seen each other stnce the story in 
Sports Illustrated ran, and Rocker 
allegedly made statements such as, 
"This Isn! over between us. You 
don 't k.now what I could do to you: 
Braves representatives have 
acknowledged the encounter but 
have not confirmed any specifics. 

In a conversation with my dad 
last week, he partially convinced me 
that what baseball did to Rocker 
after he made those comments was 
wrong. Granted, I did come out and 
say that the Braves should cut him 
because of the comments, and both 
my dad and I agreed Rocker was a 
worthless human being, but legally 
it is shady whether Rocker could 
have been released or even pun-
ished for what he said. 

That is not true this time around. 
They might not teach the basics of 
the law back in Georgia where 
Rocker is from, but threatening vio-
lence against somebody is against 
the law. Not only can you not hurt 
somebody, you can't threaten to hurt 
anyone in a way that makes him fear 
for his safety. For this offense, 
Rocker can be dismissed from his 
job, and no lawyer or judge in the 
country would be able to find a legit-
imate reason to reinstate him. 

The truth of the matter is that if 
Rocker were still playing at the level 
that he was playing at earlier this 
season, the Braves wouldn't release 
him no matter what he did. He 
could kill a cop in the line of duty 
and the Braves would have had him 
pitch the ninth inning and then 
rush him to the gas chamber for his 
execution. 

Unlike the time last year and 
. earlier this season when Rocker's 

fastball was basically unhittable, 
the Braves ace closer has fallen on 
hard times of late. In his last 17 1/3 
innings Rocker has issued 25 walks 
and has nearly cost the Braves a few 
games that already seemed to be 
decided in their favor. 

Only now that Rock.er's baseball 
ability has fallen back to earth will 
he pay for what he has done. 

Fans all over the country have 
booed him incessantly when he 
sprints onto the field in the ninth

Recognition 
Night 

Athletic department honors UCSD's top athletes at the annual 
Athletics Recognition Night dinner 
Sports Editor 

The Thton athletic commision celebrat-
ed its last year in Division III Thursday 
evening at the annual Athletics Recognition 
Night held at the La Jolla Marriot on June 1. 

In an evening that included fancy 
clothes, fine food and even finer acceptance 
speeches, a number of UCSD athletes were 
honored with various awards. 

The evening's climax wu reached with 
the presentation of the Outstanding Senior 
Student/Athlete award. 

Allison Bender of the women's volleyball 
team and Mark Latronica of the men's 
swimming squad received the award. 

It was a big evening for Latronica, who in 
addition to the final honor, took home one of 
several Athlete of the Year honors and a Vice 
Chancellor's Scholar-Athlete award. 

Over the course of his senior year, 
Latronica won the NCAA l00-meter back-
stroke in a meet record time of 48.81, was 
named an All-American and became the 
first ever athlete from UCSD named as the 
GTE Academic All-American of the Year 
because of his 3.93 GPA. 

"I think the key is whatever you're 
doing, don't worry about other things." 
Latronica said of being a student athlete. "If 
you're at the pool training, don't worry 
about class. (f you're in class, don't worry 
about training. It's about focus. 

"It's somebody who puts high regard to 
academics, but realizes there is more to life 
than books; Latronica continued. "(t's the 

epitome of balancing the mind and body." 
During his final acceptance speech of 

the night, Latronica talked about what it 
means to be a Thton. 

"It's the team concept; he said. "It's self-
lessness. You put your teammates before 
yourself. You suppon your team in whatever 
happens." 

Bender added on a Vice Chancellor's 
Scholar-Athlete award herself in her big 
evening. 

Fifteen Athletes of the Year were named 
on Thursday. SoftbaJJ's Erin Bridges and Leea 
Harlan, men's volleyball's Donald Chen, 
men's golfs James Donahoe, women's soc-
cer's Cindy Dostalek and janine Harispc. 
track and field's Jim Freeman and james 
Nielson, Carolyn jones of women's track and 
field, Ross Mecham of men's water polo, 
Matt Payne of men's swimming. Amy 
Tranckino of women's tennis, Leslie Punelli 
of women's volleyball and .Jennifer Watanabe 
of . women's swimming were all named 
Athletes of the Year. 

Payne earned his stripes over the year by 
winning the 100 breaststroke with a time of 
55.04 at the NCAA Division III 
Championships and was named a Thton 
All-American. 

Nielson won the 5,OOO-tnem' run at 
nationals in a time of 14:34.97, was named 
a GTE Academic All-American with a 3.95 
GPA and earned All-American honon for 
his performance on the track. 

Watanabe was no slouch. winning three 
individual events and one team event at the 
NCAA Division III swimming champi-

onships. She won the SOO-meter freestyle in 
an NCAA record time of 4:55.48, the 400-
meter individual m~ in 4:27.28 and the 
200-meter backstroke an 2:03.30. She was 
also a pan of the women's 800-meter 
freestyle relay team that took home a tint 
place. 

Jones, Bridges, Chen, Donahoe, 
Dostalek, Freeman, Mecham, Punelli and 
Thmckino all added All-American honors. 

It was a huge night for Harispe. In addi-
tion to the Athlete of the Year Award. she 
also won the NCAA Woman of the Year 
Award, was named an All-America and a 
GTE Academic All-American and was pert 
of the women's soccer tcam that won the 
1999 NCAA Division III Championship. 

"I think of a well-rounded person," 
Harispe said of student athletes. "Especially 
at this school.lA student athlete) can juggle 
many things, and they understand -the 
imponance of being physically fit." 

Harispe has a slightly different opinion 
then t'.atronica when it came to describing 
what it means to be a 1liton, but both had 
the same general definition. 

"It's working hard and teamwork," said the 
soccer star. "It's making sure others do well. 
It's not Just selflessness but working hard." 

Harispe was especially happy about the 
NCAA Woman of the Year Award. 

"It's an incredible honor; Harispe said. 
"There's an amazing number of female ath-
letes, not just here but everywhere. I worked 
hard, and everyone else did. There are some
