SelVlce Needs: which prOVIdes reasons to 
be optimistiC about the lives of California 
seniors over he next 50 years, was pre-
pared for state legislators by the California 
Policy Research Center, a UC program. 

The report prolects the demography, 
assistance needs and fiscal Impact of 
Callfomla's senior ollzens, and also POints out 
tha while the rallo of seniors 0 working·age 
IndlV1duals IS expected 0 double by 2050, 
[here will be Ii e Impa on [ e sta e budge 
because the elderly as a group pay sligh Iy 
more n taxes than they cost In benefits. 

The report proleds that population aging

relative to state Income. A,though heal h 
care cos:s are rising rapidly here as else-
where. Improving nealth of sertJors and 
declining ra es of nurSing home utllizallon

"V,Ie have .1 COl11ll1itlllent to 
cxcellence, and we want to maintain 
that comminnent," Edwards said. 
"l lowcver, if the current trend con-
tlnUCS, we have to seriously consid-
t!r limiti ng the number of ~ports 
programs and athletes at UCSD." 

UCSD represents one of the 
largest Division II program in the 
n.ltion with 23 teams and roughly 
600 student-athletes. 

"One of the hallmarb of our 
program IS the diverse number of 
sports availablc at this campus," 
Edwards said. "But with the cur-
rent uudget cuts, it'll be difficult to 
main tain that diversity." 

Despite drastic CutS in funding, 
the university IS still investing In 
projects to ensu re that UCSD 
doesn't take steps bade in its 
progress. Programs such as the 
Next Generation StudentLink ser-
vice helps the university keep pace 
with other UC campuses. 

"We want to make sure our stu-

taki ng steps forward, even in times

For now, the ClIts seem to be 
permanent for at least the next four 
years, and the UC D administra-
tion anticipates a campus-wide bud-
get plan within the next three 
l1Ionths to give a clearer picture to 
students md staff of what they must 
do and what the cutS mean for

Internet file sharing law puts 
consumers and industry leaders 

in a sticky situation 
By MARIANNE MADDEN 

S taft Writer 

Basically 
Career choICes are far from clear for 

those graduating with degrees in esoteric 
subjects like communKiltlons, but 

blonde h<lir may qualify for TV weather. 

MONDAY 
FEBRUARY 3, 2003 

Computer store shelves over-flow with blank Ds; hard drivcs bulge at the scams 
with thousands of pirated songs, 
movies and software programs; 
media junkies swap all forms of 
electronic media like candy after a 
mght or trick-or-treating on 
Halloween; and record companies 
fume about the lost profits that this 
rampant file sharing represcnts. 
The battle between record compa-
nies and fans of free music is noth-
ing new - Napster was forcefully 
dismantled year ago, but deriva-
tive programs like Kazaa and 

oulseek quickly sprung up to 
replace it. What's new, however, is 
punishment that flows both ways 
between file sharers and the record 
companies from which they steal. 

Exhibit A: the .E.T. Act. 
" . E.T. " cutely and odiously 
stands for 0 Electronic Theft. 
Signed in 1997 by forlller President 
Bill Clinton, thi act makes felons 
out of tho e found guilry of repro-
ducing or (listrlbuting copyrighted 
works without· permission. Ulllil 
now, this law has been, for the most 
part, ignored - but thanks 10 a let-
ter written by a group of congress-
men (including California Senator 
Dianne Feinstein) to Attorney 
General John Ashcroft, that' about 
to change. 

\ Vhile before, 
swapping files on 
Kazaa only pre-
;umablv landed 
you in' the ninth 
circle of Ilell, the 

r.E.I: Act will nel 
you a year III pri on 
If the file, wapped

equivalent of 

page 5 

were gouged by this unfall' prH:ll1g 
can file claims Ihro\l~h the \ V.::b 
site, which cMima[Cs the future ,et-
dements to be berween . 5 ,md $20 
per per,on . That'~ nOI much 
money, of course, but It', 'wrel}' .1 
stan. 

So there's an intercHing dualit) 
happening - on one Side, there:, 
the widespread refunding of mOlle}, 
to consumers because record COIl1-
panies overcharged for CDs, anti 
on the other side, there's the prose-
cution of peer-to-pcer network 
u ers for robbery. Thi is payback 
time for the record cOlllpJni es: 
Consumers are responding to these 
in£lated CD price by downloading 
music en masse and taking back the 
half-billion dollars the record com-
panies stole frolll them in the fi rM 
place. 

Failing to see this, of course, 
record companies continuc to seek 
prosecution for consumers who 
ha\'e avoided buying their O\'cr-
priced album. lake a hint, record 
companie : There i; a connecllon 
between $17.99 alhums and the 
incredible appeal of obtamlllg thIS 
same music freely and illegally. 

Il ere's :1Il idea ' Let's make 
everything even by the SlIllUllanC-
ous abandonmcnt of settlemcnt,

lile-trading network (111 the expcc-

yeJr 111 the slammer, at lea .. t In the-
ory. To "duck ,I cOlwictlon," says 
Polk 'vVagncr, assislant professor at 
the Ulliversiry of Penn~ylvania Law 
School, "you'd have to, in essence, 
prove you were an idiOt. Not a 
problem for some, but a big prob-
lem for mosl file-sharers, I sus-
peCI." 

j et-Junlue~, you knew thiS was 
cOllllng. The IllUSIC industry has 
been whinll1g about decrea ed 
profit!> ever since Napster and its 
descendants became popular, 
despite any real drop in profits. 
Not that this whining is totally 
unjustified, but it is presumpruous 
for record companies to say that a 
downloaded song represents a lost 
sale, and often spawns the argu-
ment from bitter filesharers that 
most music belllg produced today 
IS simply not worth buying -
downloading for free and scra pping 
after a few listens, perhaps, Lut not 
bUYlllg. 

Bur what's new and heartening 
to the millions or mu;ic fans who 
scorn the high price or recorded 
music, is the Compact Disc 
Minimulll Advertised Price 
Antitrust Litigation . An article 
about this was included in the Jan. 
30 i sue of the GIJllrdfon. 

According to IlS Web silc, 
hll p ://www.mumdlS(Stllltmrnl.com , 
this Ii ttle gem IS "a proposed setde-
ment of lawsuits brought by 
Attorneys eneral of 43 states, 
Commonweahh and TerritOries" 
who allege that record labels and 
musIc stores violated federal and 
state antitrust laws by overcharging 
consumers for recorded music 
(CDs, cassettes and vinyl) by a total 
of $500 million. 'ol1Sul1lers who

And we mustn't forget Ihat thc

off"red much to the "debate" over 
war in Iraq aside from ideas that 
hiStory has proven to be, at hest, 
worth Ignoring.

sons not to su pport war: the appar-
ent hypocrisy in our support for

the students who tore down the signs 
promoting the anti-war rail)" he 
somehow implied that the U.S. 
Marine Corps was composed of less 
enlightened people who merely 
wanted 10 "kick Iraqi ass." The 
young men and women who ch~e 
to serve in the Marines become a part 
of the worlds finest fighting force 
and do so to defend the onstituoon 
aga llht all enelllles, foreign and 
dOillesoc .. n,e}, fight for the pCl'son 
next to them, and they will continue 
to win wars becJuse of the pride and 
honor they recl in serving a IlJtion 
sccmingly full ofingratcs. -l1ley don't 
fight to "kick lraqi ass" - that is jll't 
d,c by-product of uperior tl'JlIllllg. 

Cardoza suggested that it rook 
"real couragc" to attend the 
rally. Here is sOlllething to think 
about, Cardoza: It does not take 
courage to come to the Pri e 
Center for lunch, bask in the gor-
geous LaJolla weather, wave a sign 
and wear a T-shirt that says "Fuck 
Hush ," It takes courage to put on a 
gas mask :Jnd a charcoal suit, pick 
lip a rine, fly half-way around the 
world and sit in an Iraqi desert 

ri~king life and limb under the 
threat of hiological and chemical 
warfare to defend your brothers 
and Ister~ in arms. Real courage IS 
nsking your life and sacrificing the 
things that we college rudcnts 
take for granted. 

ff you want to be a "coura-
geous" war protester, become a 
human shield; at least that takes 
real courage (and a lot of stupidi-
ty). But don't pretend a single lec-
ture hall worth of students (if that 
lIlany) are showing true courage, 
or even truly critical thought, by 
waving a sign and feigning sophis-
tication.

UCSD favors multiple 
transit options 

Editor: 
I'd like to clarify the perception 

("Criti s Reject Trolley," Jan. 16 

issue of the GUQ1'dian) that UCSD 
prefers bus rapid transit service to 
the cxc1u ion of the long-planned 
trolley service. Actually, we need 
and want both . 

UCSD h,., worked s ucccssf~ully 
wnh Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board on light rail 
transit alignments and IS parti ci-
pating in the current ,\1Id-Coast 
Tramit First SOldy. Our goall~ to 
assure that efrcctlve rapid tran~it 
service i~ proVided to the ca mpu,> 
and nearhy collllllunities in a tlllle-
Iy manner. 

If LRT service WIll not be a\'ail-
able before 2012, the campus and 
the community need sOllletlling 
before then. BRT has the potennal 
to fill the gap as campu~ growth 
occurs. If thetvlJd-Coast mldy II1di-
cates that BRT is the best long-term 
solution, then that service can be 
expanded to provide local and 
regional transit. If LRT is chosen, 
then BRT service can provide both 
short-term connections to the 
remainder of the regions light rail 
system, as well as local community 
service (the planned Super Loop). 

BRT is flexible, can be imple-
mented incrementally and can 
provide much-needed service 
before the trolley. Whether it's 
BRT or LRT in the long run, we 
need Illore transit opportulllties 
now and in the future.

for me, the real ti p-off has been the 
fact that every sillgle person on the

My usual reply to questions like 
this is," ot a fucking clue." This 
tends not to satisfy most people, 
however, because "not a fucking

([hough ir it were, 1 feel I would

Protest: Student groups 
march down Library Walk 

cIJnlll1ued from page 1 
""orld courses at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, directly cril-
ici7Cd the president'S address 
and argued that there is not 
enough internatio nal su pport 
for a United rarcs-Ied war in 
Iraq. 

"It is increasingly clear that 
thc vast majority of pcople on this 
planet, as well as at least half the 
pcople in this country, believ'e 
that war is not right at this timc," 
Cardoza said. 

According to Cardoza, hun-
dreds of posters advertising the 
rally wcre torn down in the days 
preceding the event. 

"I think the most important 
message we can send is that it's 
OK to be against war, and Ulat it 
can even be patrioti c to be 
against this war," Cardoza said . 
"[t takes a considerable amount 
of cou rage to come Ollt and 
statld lip against a powerful gov-
ernment and its supporters -
considerably more courage, I 
would suggest, than it takes to 
anonymously tear down 
posters." 

According to An hell, the 
campus rally was part of:1 nation-
al day of action planned by vari-
ous college campus leaders at the 
San Francisco protests on the 

weekend of Jan . 18. 
" It looks like a war with lraC[ is 

really incvit,lble at this point, so 
what we're trying to do is show 
there ', opposition," Anshell sa id 
in reaction to the tatc of the 
Union addre s. 

Anshell said tha t the group's 
goal wa realistiC. 

" \Ne don't expect to stop it 
before it Sta rts, but we do expect 
to budd a growing movement, " 
she said. 

The noon-time rally not unly 
attracted passing students, but 
also local TV camera crews, 
UCSD professors and adminis-
trators, including Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Ltfe 
Carmen Vasquez. 

''I'm glad that this is happen-
ing on our campus," Vasquez 
said . " I think it's important for 
students to be able to challenge 
systems and question issues. It's 
the life and heart of the univer-
sity." 

ponsors for the rally included 
the UCSD Peace Coalition, the 
UCSD Greens and Students for 
Justice and Peace. 

TI,e U SO Peace oalition 
sponsored several other anti-war 
events during fall quarter, includ-
ing a concert held at Price Center 
in December 2002.

History: 
Award given 
to Watson in 
month kickoff 

conllnued from paRe 1 
"I want a whole year for black 

history," Malveaux said . "We need 
to celebrate black htstory every day." 

During her address, Malvcaux 
stressed the need to promote diver-
sity in higher education, drawing 
upon a statistic showing that the 
percentage of blacks wi th a college 
degree by age 28 is half the rate for 
whites. 

"The education gap must bl! 
closed," Malveaux said. "A cia s-
room should have a wide range of 
participants to contribute to the 
learning experience. Who wants a 
class full of only valedictorians, 
anyway?" 

Higher education was a theme 
emphasized in the days' speeches. 
Brief biographical anecdotes of 
black academics, such as sociologist 
and author WE.B. Dubois; Ernest 
Everett Just, a Howard University 
biologist and first recipient of the 
Spingarn Medal ; and Phyllis 
Wallace, the first black woman to 
earn a doctorate at Yale University. 

Renee Barnett-Terry, a co-chair 
of the event, noted that this year's 
national theme of the celebration, 
"The Souls of Black Folk: 
Centennial Reflections," i a refer-
ence to the DuBois' landmark book 
on black society publi hed in 1903. 
[n "The ouls of Black Folk," 
DuBois claimed that "the problem 
of the 20th century was the prob-
lem of the color line." Barnett-
Terry said that "the efforts of black 
Americans ro reconcile their 

frican heritage with their pride of 
bcing U.S. Citizens" is still a rele-
vant i~,uc today. 

Al so during the event, Vice 
Cha ncellor of tudent Affairs 
Joseph W. Warson wa presented 
the fir5t Award for utstanding 
Contributions to [Iigher 
Education by Chancellor Robert 
C. Dynes. A misty-eyed Watson 
appeared overwhelmed with emo-
tion as he accepted the award.

Volleyball: UCSD doesn't 
win crucial points of games 

continued from /Xlge r 6 
The mistakes that plagued 

UCSD all night were evident 
again in the deciding fifth game, 
and the last of a season-high 28 
ervice errors served as a fitting 

fooUlo[c when the Triton uncere-
moniously bowed out 15-7. 

UCSD gave signs of mounting 
a comeback in the third game 
with sener Eric Perrine feeding 
Waller and Young, who each fin-
ished with 14 kills on the night. 
The Tritons rallied to a game 
point .n 29-28, hUI u1ey could not 
come lip with the crucial play to 
take the game and the Waves 
ripped the opportuniry away to 
finish the sweep with a 32 -30 Will . 

UCSD head coach Ron Larsen 
talked about his team's inability to 
cOllle through in the clmch and 
win the key points that were need-
ed to win ule match. 

"Clearly it has to do with our 
execution of our fundamentals," 
he said . "We're not grounded 
enough in thosc opportunities. 
Part of it is we don't get in those 
opportunities enollgh." 

With no time to lament the 
previous night's loss, UCSD took 
to the court the following 
evening against 2002 National 
Runner-Up Pepperdine. The 
'Tf'itons werc clearly still replay-
ing the previous night 's los in 
their mind, and uley came out 
tragically flat while the Waves 
cmbarrassed UCSD in the first 
game by 30-16. 

The Tritons put up more of a 
fight in game "YO, but still lacked 
the fire and intensity they'd pos-
sessed the prcviou night when 
they fell 30-25 . 

Coach Larsen blamed his 
team's poor stan on the effect of 
droppll1g such a tough match that 
UCSD was expected to win. 

"1 think we go imo most 
matches the underdog," he said. 
"1 think the loss affected us a 
whole lot more because all of 3 
sudden we're expected to win ." 

Young commented Jater about 
what his team would nced to win 
the crucial poims in matches that 
u1ey have been struggling with 
lately. 

"Mainly confidence," he said. 
"vVe've got to play like wc're used 
to winning." 

UCSD cravels to Provo, Utah, 
to take a team that's used to win-
ning - Brigham YOWlg University 
- in a pair of matches Feb. 7 and 
Feb. 8, when the Tritons will 
resume uleir quest for the elusive 
first M P F win of the year.

on Sarurdar nIght." 

Feb. I did prove to be more 
successful for the Tritons, who 
lost in overrime when San 
Francisco State outscored UC 0 
13-5. 

Again, the Tritons fell behind 
111 the first half when they made 
only 42 percent of Iheir , hots 
fro 111 the IicJu. After the fir,t 20 
minutes, they left the court down 
by sa with 3 score of 34-28. 

UCSO was able to come back 
in the second half and domin;lte, 
makll1g 50 percem of it~ shots to 
tie the game at 58. 

In overtime. it was again 
,hooting that cost the Tnrons the 
game. The team went l-for-9 
while San Francisco State was 
able to comple te 75 percent of 
their shots. 

"Shooting should be one of 
the strengths of this team beca use 
indIvidually, we are all talented 
shooters. I t just seems that we 
don't hit our hots in games, so I 
don't think we should nece,s3roly 

alter practice, we just need to 
individually make our shots," said 
freshman Adam nyder about the 
recent low shooting percentages. 

Though the team came back 
with its sixth loss in a row, Snyder 
had another succes~(uj 
weekend. I Ie lead the team in 
scoring with 13 points on Jan . 31 
and again scored 13 on Feb. I. 

"I am happy to be getttng 
more minutes, but it wa, tough 
not to get a wi n this week," 

nyder said. 
Thi s weekend' main !>ucces, 

story was red -shirt freshman Ian 
Conti , who gOt hIS first stJrt on 
Feb. I. lie JI~o earned hiS li rSI 
collegIate double-double WIth 12 
points and 10 rebounds in the 
gallic. 

"Matt played :I very phy~ l cal 
game going for the Iloarl1s," 
Llnthier said . "It WJ great to , ee 
him get his first double-double." 

The lritons will hit the rOld 
:Igain next weekend to play CS 
Bakersfield on Feb. 7 and CS 
Stanislaus on Feb. 8.

home." 
For UCSD, Margaret Johnson 

pulled down eight rebounds to go 
along WIth six poil1ls. Freshman 
point guard Bianca Watson had 3 
career-high five assists. 

"We weren't taking the ball lip 
strong, but there were some weird 
fouls ca))ed," said Bromley, who had 
eight points and seven rebounds in 
the game. "Our defense was really 
good. [Sonoma State] is a very 
strong, fundamentally sound team.» 

UC D shot 3-for-4 from the 
free-throw line and didn 't shoot one 
in the second half, while Sonom3 
State shot 17-for-27 from the chari-
ty stripe. The Tritons were called for 
25 fouls to the Seawolves' 14. 

The loss in onoma put UCSD 
in a conference tie with San 
Francisco State. But that tie would 
last only about a day. With a scoring 
boost off the bench and four players 
in double figures, UCSD took out 
the Gators in San FranCISCo 87-74 
on Feb. I. 

"Everything was firing, n said 
Siam, who scored 17 points in only 
20 minutes of play. "We expo cd 
holes in their defense and took 
advantage." 

The ators had the lead with 
7:54 left in the first half at 25-23, 
but the Tritons finished the half 
with a 23 -9 run to lead by 12 at the 
break. 

"Their defense was tough at 
first," said Bromley, who had II 
points and five rebounds on the 
night. "But once we figured it out, 
we got a lot of open shots." 

San Francisco State closed the 
deficit to nine points WIth J 5:33 left , 
but the Gators wouldn't get any 
closer and the Trrtons cruised to an 

87-7~ conference victory. 
" It was a fun game," said Ginn, 

who had 14 points, six rebounds 
and three assists. "They had two 
good post players. Our po ts did a 
good job on them." 

Watson contributed off the 
bench to eclip,e her career-high in 
assists from the previous night with 
seven and also had three steals. 
Lauren Sargent provided a spark 
off the bench as well with 13 points 
in nine minutes of play. 

"Bianca [\\~Ison] had a really 
good weekend," Bromley said of 
the reserve guard . "She stepped It 
up big time. This was a fun win."

again next weekend to face CSU

perfect start 
Team shows 

its strength in 
season opener 

By CHRlmNE LIM 
Staff Writer 

On any team, the loss of old 
players and addition of new players 
usually takes some getting used to. 
T hIS season, seven of the 12 players 
on the UCSD women 's tcnms team 
are freshmen. However, its first 
ma tch of the season proves that the 
team is as strong as ever. On Feb. I, 
the Tritons beat C U an 
Bernardino, setti ng the tone for 
another dommant season. 

"We played well," said UCSO 
head coach 1.17 LaPlante. "ThIS 
game allowed the gIrls to get the 

jittcr~ out and the freshmen to get 
thel r feet wer." 

UCSD's three doubles tcams, 
playing eight-game pro sets, never 
allowed CSUSB to have the upper 
hand. The Tritons' doubles o. 1 
team of freshman Jenna Ishii and 
Jumor co-captain Julie We terman 
won 8-3, the doubles 0.2 team of 
sophomore Jasmin Dao and fresh-
man -lara SiddIqUI won 8-0, and 
the doubles o. 3 team of JUnior 
co-captam KrIstina Jansen and 
freshman Leigh Robem won 8- 1. 

I n the singles matches, Dao

Men's volleyball falls to USC, Pepperdine 
By BRYCE WARWICK 

Staff Writer 

UCSD men's volleyball found itself in the unfa-
miliar position of being the favorite, but was unable 
ro ca pItalize on oppornlllitie and suffered a 1-2 
week, sweeping Princeton Univer iry before drop-
pmg Mountain Pacific ports Federation matches 
against U C and Pepperdine Univer iry. 

The Tritons opened their week Jan. 29 against 
the Princeton Tigers. ollling off difficult matches 
against the top teams in the nation, the Tritons were 
more than ready for Princeton. U 0 tamed the 
ligers 30-20 m the first game and 30-25 in the sec-
ond game, scoring almost at will and hitting over the 
unimpo ing Princeton block. The Tigers put a scare 
into UCSO in the third game when they managed a 
27-24 lead, but the Triton squad that eemed to be in 
cruise control throughout the match elenlted their 
play and rattled off a five-point nUl that led to a 30-
28 win and the sweep. 

1\\10 nights later, o. IS -ranked CS D hosted 

By OWEN MAIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

With a split of its weekend road 
games, UCSD women's basketball 
(5- 12, 5-7 California ollegiate 
Athletic Association) won its fifth 
game of eight and moved into a tic 
for eventh place with Cal Pol y 
Pomona in the CCAA. '. 

On Jan. 31, the Tritons shot 
under 30 percent from the ficld and 
anempted 23 fewer free-throws than 
their opponents, losi ng to Sonoma 

tate at Seawolf Gym 56-49. 
Sonoma State got off to a good 

start, out 'coring UCSD 21l- 19 in 
the first half. unranked USC 111 front of a raucous home crowd, 

looking to pIck up ItS fir~t ,\IPSF \\111 and rever e 
the trend of 11-ojan dOllllnance. UCS D came ou t 
strong and electrified the crowd with a 30-22 
drillIng of USC in whIch the Tmons appeared to be 
in complete control. JIm \\ 'aller ~erved up three 
aces during a fi,'e-pornt service run early in the 
ga me and the Tritons hit .440, leJvmg little doubt 
in the m.inds of ob erver .. that UCSD would take 
the match handily. 

Rebe<a Drexler/Cuardian 
Finesse: UCSD middle blocker KeVin Keyser taps the ball 
over the net trying to catch USC off-guard on Jan. 31 . 

"We never rcally gOt II1to our 
offensive flow," said Junior Ali Ginn, 
who had a team-high 13 points. " \,\It" 
played good, aggressive defense, but 
we just couldn't get J break . The 
free throws were ule difference." 

In the second half. the Trnom 
made runs at the eawolf lead, but 
could never get the momentum to 
swing fllll y their way. ua D's top 
scorers, .inn and senior icholle 
Bromley, fouled out in the .. econd 
half. 

However, thi wa to he a mght of momentum, 
whIch the Trojans proved in game two when they 
evened the match with a 30-2 1 vlcton'. The Triton 
attack that had been ~o eftiuenr 111 the first game

gall1 a 28-27 lead, but needing just two points to
