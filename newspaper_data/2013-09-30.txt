The University of California 
Board of Regents announced their 
six-week Promise For Education 
scholarship campaign at their meet-
ing last month; since then, the cam-
paign raised nearly $1 million for 
the UC system. The money will go 

directly toward UC scholarships.
Promise for Education allows 

individuals to make a personal 
promise — run a marathon, adopt 
a pet, volunteer, grow a beard — set 
a crowdfunding goal and share the 
promise on Facebook or other social 
media sites. The money raised will 
go directly toward scholarships and 

grants for UC undergraduates with 
financial need. The aid will be in 
addition to money students already 
receive through the University of 
California’s traditional financial aid 
programs. 

Campaigns to increase private 
support towards student scholar-
ships, like Promise for Education, 

have taken on increased importance 
after years of cuts to the UC budget.

According to former chairwoman 
of the UC Board of Regents Sherry 
Lansing, the campaign is primarily 
driven by participation from UC stu-
dents, faculty and staff.

Approximately 300 UCSD students were displaced into “tem-porary double” on-campus housing assignments this fall, due to overcrowding with a record number of 13,000 campus resi-
dents. Administrators within UCSD Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
created the temporary doubles by converting single rooms — located 
in many residential halls and some on-campus apartments — to 
double rooms composed of two wardrobes on one side of the room 
and a bunk bed on the other side. 

The change follows a 22 percent increase in admissions from

Workers 
Stage Strike 
Against New 
Terms

HUMAN  RESOURCES

UCSD service workers are protest-
ing low wages and reduced pensions 
for the second time as the University 
of California issues its final proposal 
regarding workers’ contracts. 

On Tuesday, Sept. 24, maintenance 
workers from the American Federation 
of State, County, and Municipal 
Employees 3299 marched around the 
UCSD administration complex bang-
ing pots and pans in a demonstration 
against the UC administration’s push 
for pension reform. 

An AFSCME worker, who identi-
fied herself as Carla, said through a 
translator that the protest was due to 
a lack of good-faith bargaining on the 
university’s part.

“What we’re asking for is nothing 
out of the ordinary,” she said. “It’s well 
within what the university is capable 
of. We can’t afford increases to our 
healthcare and pension contributions.”

AFSCME 3299 has protested twice 
this year for similar reasons. 

University of California’s Vice 
President for Systemwide Human 
Resources and Programs Dwaine 
Duckett issued a statement regarding 
the ongoing negotiations.

“On Sept. 3, the state’s neutral fact 
finder sided with [the University of 
California] on the key issue of pen-
sion reform and recommended the 
university’s approach,” the statement 
read. “Having completed all stages of 
the bargaining process, including state-
assisted mediation and fact finding, the 
university is legally entitled to imple-
ment its last proposal.”

The university system’s proposed 
changes include raising employee 
pension contributions from 5 percent 
to 6.5 percent, while the UC system’s 
contribution increases from 10 to 12 
percent. Employees hired after July 
1, 2013, will also receive a modified 
benefits plan. 

AFSCME is currently support-
ing legislation (SCA 15) that would 
require the UC system to adhere to 
a pension reform law that currently 
applies to all other state employees. 

Among the provisions in the 
Public Employees Pension Reform 
Act is a pension cap that would be 
imposed on the UC executives who 
retire with six figure salaries. For 
example, UC President Mark Yudof, 
whose last day is Monday, Sept. 30, is 
guaranteed at least $230,000 in pen-
sion and benefits after five years in 
his position.

BRIEFS by helen  hejran  staff  writer
▶ UCSD Holds Annual Convocation 
Dinner: UCSD held its annual con-
vocation dinner for freshmen and 
transfer students on Sept. 24 on 
RIMAC Field. 

Keynote speaker Carol Padden, 
a UCSD communications professor, 
addressed the students on varying top-
ics, from the importance of commu-
nication to commending the students 
for all that they have already achieved.

“A university education is not just 
about courses you will take and the 
friends you make here, but it’s about 
becoming a person,” Padden said dur-
ing her speech. “Acquire flexibility in 
your point of view; see the world from 
the eyes of someone who lives in a 
world very different from this one.”

▶ Founder of UCSD Literature 
Department Dies: Carlos Blanco 
Aguinaga, one of the founders of the 
UCSD literature department, passed 
away in La Jolla on Sept. 11, 2013.

After holding positions at Colegio 
de México, Johns Hopkins University 
and Ohio State University, Aguinaga 

was recruited in 1964 to help form 
the literature department at UCSD. 
In 1994, Aguinaga gained Professor 
Emeritus status.

Aguinaga is survived by his wife 
Iris Blanco Arevalo, two daughters 
Alda Blanco and Maria Blanco, son 
Renato Barahona and two grand-
children Amaya Blanco Ramirez and 
Ernesto Barahona Mallen.

▶ Record Number of Admits to 
UCSD: A record number of 5,179 
incoming freshmen and 2,645 incom-
ing transfer students entered UCSD 
this fall quarter.

Since last year, the number of stu-
dents who have accepted UCSD’s offer 
has increased by 22 percent. 

The incoming freshmen have an 
overall GPA of 4.06 and SAT Reasoning 
scores of 612, 670 and 627 for Critical 
Reading, Math and Writing, respec-
tively. The transfer students’ GPA was 
3.52.

“UCSD continues to attract and 
enroll the best and the brightest stu-
dents,” Interim Vice Chancellor of 

Student Affairs Alan Houston said to 
ucsdnews.com. “Our ability to do so 
is testament to UCSD’s prominence 
as a world-class university that offers 
students extraordinary opportunities 
to thrive and succeed.”

▶ San Diego Student Wins Google 
Science Fair Award: Seventeen-year-
old Canyon Crest Academy student  
and UCSD student lab researcher 
Eric Chen won the grand prize at the 
Google Science Fair for his project 
that utilizes computer technology to 
find new treatments to fight against 
influenza. 

He beat thousands of competitors 
from 120 countries and was award-
ed a $50,000 scholarship, a ten-day 
trip to the Galapagos Island and the 
opportunity to visit the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research 
in Switzerland.

Eric began his project a year ago, 
aiming to develop drugs that can fight 
influenza in a more effective way.

“The current flu drugs we have 
are losing their effectiveness. More 

resistant flu strains are appearing. We 
urgently need new flu drugs, and that’s 
what I’m trying to do,” Eric said. “We 
need our future scientists.”

▶ UCSD Celebrates Native American 
Day: The 8th annual California Native 
American Day celebration at UCSD, 
themed “Honoring Tradition Through 
Culture and Education,” will run from 
Sept. 27 until May 2014.

The events will honor the past, pres-
ent and future cultures of the Native 
Americans in San Diego, California 
and throughout the United States.

Since its conception, the California 
Native American Day has been held 
on the fourth Friday of September, but 
recently, UCSD has expanded the holi-
day to a yearlong celebration of Native 
American history and culture.

“We are dedicated to strengthening 
the relationship between UCSD and 
local tribal communities and raising 
awareness on our campus about the 
legacy and contributions of the Native 
American community,” Chancellor 
Pradeep K. Khosla said.

last year, coupled with the contin-
ued four-year housing guarantee first 
introduced to the incoming class of 
2012. The previous year, students were 
guaranteed three years of on-campus 
housing. 

“We have a commitment to house 
our incoming freshmen and transfer 
students who want to live on cam-
pus,” Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
HDH Mark Cunningham said. “This 
demand coupled with increased 
demand from continuing students 
who want to remain on campus gen-
erated a situation where demand for 
housing was at all-time high. However, 
we kept our commitment to our par-
ents and incoming students to provide 
on-campus housing.”

The temporary doubles will not 
have the desk and chair available in 
typical rooms; instead, students will 
likely have to use desks placed in the 
common areas of residential halls. 

“[HDH] looked at various options, 
and when all other housing alterna-
tives were exhausted and the demand 
was still higher than availability, HDH 
developed the required space by con-
verting regular singles into temporary 
doubles,” Cunningham said. 

According to Cunningham, stu-
dents received these assignments 
based on the date of their housing 
application submission. Since then, 
HDH has received concerns regard-
ing the assignments and their lack of 
personal space.

However, students’ chief complaint 
continues to be the pricing, as those 
placed in temporary doubles pay the 
same annual price of $9,809 as triple 
room residents but have 13.33 less 
square feet per student.

Currently, there are several petitions 
on change.org urging UCSD to lower 
the cost for those in temporary double 
rooms or assist in placing the stu-
dents in nearby off-campus apartment 
complexes. One petition on change.

org, aimed at Chancellor Pradeep 
K. Khosla and titled “University of 
California at San Diego: Lower the 
Price of the Temporary Double or Find 
More Housing,” garnered 988 support-
ers since the housing assignments were 
announced. 

“Living in a single room with 
another person and no desk is real-
ly outrageous for the price,” student 
Morgan Goulart said in a comment on 
the petition. 

While they are not pursuing 
any on-campus housing projects at 
the moment, HDH does hope that 
demand for housing subsides follow-
ing the beginning of the school year.

“Temporary doubles have been, 
and are being and will continue to be 
returned to regular singles spaces as 
regular spaces open up, and if residents 
in the temporary spaces choose to 
move or not,” Cunningham said.

“The campaign is about students 
and the democratization of funding,” 
Lansing said. “If everyone raised $10, 
that would amount to a huge number. 
Everybody could help somebody else 
who can’t handle education finan-
cially.”

Crowdfunding sites such as 
Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been 
around for several years and have 
often been an arena for innovative 
ideas, with Promise for Education 
surrounding the new idea of crowd-
funded scholarships. The story 
behind Promise for Education began 
a couple years ago with an idea from 
social media expert Noah Kerner 
and Regent Sherry Lansing.  Lansing 
reached out to Kerner who then flew 

to Lansing’s Los Angeles office to 
discuss the idea of crowdsourcing 
scholarships. 

Following discussions, Promise 
for Education became a group ini-
tiative of the Regents, the Office of 
the President and several other col-
lectives and individuals. Promise for 
Education is the newest addition to 
the Project You Can campaign, a sys-
tem-wide effort, run by UC Regents, 
to raise $1 billion towards student 
support through 2014. According to 
Crowdfund Insider, the campaign has 
raised more than $700 million, 70 
percent of its intended goal.

“Have some fun with it or do 
something serious,” Lansing said. “I’d 
like everybody to participate, on any 
level.”  

To date, several prominent celeb-

rities, politicians and UC Chancellors 
such as actor Jamie Foxx, Governor 
Jerry Brown and UCSD Chancellor 
Pradeep Khosla, have made promises. 
People interested in making a prom-
ise can visit www.promiseforeduca-
tion.org.

“I think the program has the 
best intentions for the University,” 
UCSD A.S. Associate Vice President 
External Affairs Vanessa Garcia said. 
“I think it’s a unified effort to make 
attending the UC more accessible for 
people. I’m curious to see how the 
scholarships will be compiled and 
dispersed to students. I’d like to have 
students be a large voice in that con-
versation.”

Save Your 
Best Effort
to Finish 
Off  Strong

Like anyone with an overin-flated motivation to better themselves over the summer, 
I resolved to spend some weeks 
doing bike workouts. Like anyone 
with a death wish, I chose to go 
up the steepest SoCal mountains 
I could find. About 90 percent 
of each ride was spent muttering 
darkly while I suffered through the 
slope and sun. But every time, on 
that final “home stretch,” the ride 
actually became … easy.

I, along with anyone who has 
ever used a treadmill or exercise 
bike, can thank a convenient little 
phenomenon called the goal-gradi-
ent effect for the sudden late increase 
in ability. Behavioral psychologist 
Clark Hull first discovered it in 1932, 
when he found that rats scamper-
ing toward a box of food — the goal 
— automatically quickened their 
pace as they neared it. Similarly, as 
I approached the peak of the brutal 
climb, a surge of energy magically 
kicked in and helped me on my way.

While the effect is principally 
seen in physical endeavors, it spills 
out into our daily lives as well. A 
Columbia University study by Ran 
Kivetz, Oleg Urminsky and Yuhuang 
Zheng investigated the buying habits 
of coffeeholics participating in a 
cafe’s rewards program. The sub-
jects would earn a free drink after a 
certain number of purchases. At the 
start of the program, most customers 
resigned themselves to the idea that 
no matter how many chocolate crois-
sants and lattes they downed, the 
free coffee was out of reach. Yet as 
the consumers’ quantity of purchases 
slowly edged toward the number 
necessary to earn a free coffee, the 
frequency drastically increased.

The crucial factor behind this 
biological wiring is that the ever-
parsimonious body reserves energy 
and adrenaline for when it most 
needs it, in an attempt to attain a 
substantial source of food, water 
or shelter. So although I had been 
begging my legs the entire way up 
the hill for a miraculous boost, they 
steadfastly refused my supplications 
until the very top. This leads us to 
the question of whether we can trick 
our bodies into giving us that little 
advantage whenever we’d like.

Fortunately, we can. But it does 
come with caveats. Common wis-
dom has always advised that long 
tasks such as boring essays should be 
broken up into portions, each with 
its own mini-goal. The expectation 
here is that there will be a surge of 
motivation and energy associated 
with each little mission. Yet just 
as the body eventually runs out of 
its supply of calories, endorphins 
and adrenaline after charging up a 
mountain pass, too many goal-ori-
ented efforts will end up sapping our 
resolve. So perhaps it’s a better idea 
to just endure the drudgery until 
your brain kicks into high gear.

Though you’re certainly eager 
to bury yourself in mammalian 
physiology or differential equations, 
if you burn yourself out now, you’ll 
be spent when you need your men-
tal faculties the most. So just relax, 
and let finals week take care of itself 
once December swings along. Listen 
to Blurred Lines another 50 times. 
Watch some slapstick Vines every 
now and again. And just have a fabu-
lous fall quarter, everyone.

President Obama’s new plan 
to use a federal ranking system 
to allocate financial aid is not 
the solution for current higher 

education issues.

Federal 
Ranking 
System
Flawed

President Obama’s proposal for granting financial 
aid to universities based on 
a new college rating system is 
sure to stir up another filibuster, 
as the debate regarding higher educa-
tion reform continues. 

On the surface, President Obama’s plan may seem like a good 
idea, but it should be regarded with a certain degree of skepti-
cism due to its policy implications and timeline and cost issues. 
Introduced on Aug. 22, the plan proposes new standards to create 
federal college ratings by 2015, and to allocate government funding 
for student aid accordingly by 2018. Currently, the federal govern-
ment allocates over $150 million to colleges for aid grants, a number 
based on student enrollment. According to the White House Office 
of the Press Secretary, the primary changes would call for universi-
ties to be rated on low-income student enrollment, graduation rates, 
graduate earnings and affordability, rather than on standards like 
academic performance, which is currently not a parameter. The 
higher the rating, the more money universities will receive for stu-
dent financial aid.

Including graduation rates in the rating system seems reasonable, 
since schools would be rewarded for helping a majority of their stu-
dents earn a degree. However, it would be remiss to base funding for 
schools on the starting salaries of their graduates. Jordan Weissmann 
of The Atlantic magazine states that in general, alumni of elite 
schools draw bigger paychecks. As a result, a graduate from a big-
name university with a competitive GPA is likely to earn a higher 
starting pay than a graduate with the same GPA from a lesser-known 
school. Regardless of these graduates’ off-resume skills, such as 
teamwork and critical thinking, the graduate from a less prestigious 

school will be at a disadvantage with regard to pay, even if 
they are, in reality, better suited for the job. This devalues the indi-
vidual and continues to feed into superficial aspects like the cachet 
that a prestigious university name holds, while promoting prominent 
universities at the expense of lesser-known institutions. 

If the federal government creates their own system, it will just be 
another list of ratings focused solely on numbers rather than on stu-
dents. President Obama is suggesting that universities should receive 
subsidies based on college ‘value,’ but this takes emphasis away 
from students’ academic performance and intellectual qualities. The 
proposed agenda’s interpretation of a university’s academics is tied 
to the number of classes students have completed rather than their 
ability to get good grades and be a competitive graduate. Evaluating 
universities should be a comprehensive process focused on what is 
important for students, such as affordability. Instead of making uni-
versities compete for federal aid by rating them on some of the mea-
sures currently proposed, the government should prioritize the issue 
of students actually receiving enough financial aid on an individual 
level and providing them with quality education.

Another questionable part of this plan is the extensive timeline 
and cost it would entail. According to U.S. News and World Report’s 
Allie Bidwell, in 2008, Congress banned the federal government 
from collecting  student data such as graduate earnings and gradu-
ation rates for transfer students. Overcoming the ban and obtaining 
this kind of information would be costly and unlikely in the timeline

Party Drug “Molly” Is Falsely Advertised as a Safe Stimulant

Trinidad James should have told 
people that popping a molly can 
make them do more than just sweat. 
That is, if they’re popping real molly.

Molly, the pure form of MDMA, 
has been rising in popularity with 
the electronic dance movement and 
rave scenes as a popular, fun drug 
that makes users feel euphoric and 
carefree. What most people know 
about molly is that it is frequently 
recommended and referred to by rap 
artists and celebrities and has a repu-
tation as a safe drug compared to its 
notoriously more dangerous sister 
drug ecstasy. However, this belief 
could be their biggest mistake.

Molly users are given the false 
impression that the non-addictive 

“fun” drug is harmless compared to 
other drugs like cocaine or heroin. 
Because molly is marketed to be 
a pure form of MDMA, the main 
ingredient combined with other ran-
dom drugs to create ecstasy, it has 
been viewed an easy way for users to 
maintain party-on attitudes. Celebrity 
endorsements from Kanye West, Nicki 
Minaj, Miley Cyrus and Madonna 
have glamorized the drug but have 
let a crucial truth slide: The drug is 
no safer than its predecessor, ecstasy, 
the popular drug of the ‘80s that flew 
under the social radar due to dealers’ 
tendencies to mix it with other cheap-
er substances. And the problem with 
molly is similar, because some street 
vendors of “molly” are not selling the 
idealized drug at all.

According to Drug Enforcement 

Administration spokesman Rusty 
Payne, 80 to 90 percent of substances 
collected labeled as molly had actu-
ally been completely different sub-
stances. Because the demand for 
molly has risen, buyers will purchase 
molly at $20 to $50 a dose; street ven-
dors have consequently been inclined 
to sell substitutes for the in-demand 
product.

And these molly counterfeits 
are not solely a bad trip, nor just a 
simple rip-off. The issue with these 
substitutes is that many of those mak-
ing and selling molly have no idea 
what chemicals they are tampering 
with, resulting in uninformed buy-
ers downing unknown substances. 
Several recent instances of this have 
caused medical emergencies and 
deaths. Earlier this September, two 

deaths and several cases of overdoses 
attributed to molly caused New York 
City’s Electric Zoo Festival to cancel 
the final day of their show. According 
to a Sept. 12 New York Times 
article, it was revealed that one of 
the deceased had mistakenly taken a 
combination of MDMA and the dan-
gerous psychoactive drug methylone, 
likely sold to him as molly.

While celebrities have mentioned 
and endorsed the use of molly, at the 
end of the day, they won’t be found 
buying molly from unreliable sources 
at a rave. The act of popping random 
pills has its consequences and risks, 
and people should not be fooled or 
confused to think otherwise.

that President Obama proposes. 
Gaining accurate records and infor-
mation for over 6,000 accredited 
higher education institutions is no 
simple task. Rather than allocating 
time and money towards the research 
behind a federal rating system, the 
government should spend whatever 
budget planned for the ranking sys-
tem on the students.

Not only is President Obama’s plan 
costly, but it approaches the issue of 
unequal class representation counter 
intuitively. This is already a problem 
post-secondary institutions face, and 
creating an incentive to accept lower-
income students is not the simple 
solution. If universities are presented 

with an incentive for receiving more 
financial aid than their competitors 
is enrolling higher numbers of low-
income students, institutions will 
choose to enroll even more low-
income students at the expense of 
middle class students in attempts to 
see higher ranks. Press-Enterprise 
journalist David Olson points out 
a 6 percent decline in the number 
of middle class students enrolled at 
the University of California cam-
puses from 1999 to 2010. Although 
there is an effort to create a balance, 
Obama’s plan doesn’t include a solid 
strategy to shed society of the polar-
ity that exists among people of dif-
ferent economic backgrounds. The 
policy attempts to even out the play-
ing field, but in the process, t actu-

ally takes many of the middle class 
out of the game. A better approach 
would be to support universities 
enrolling students from various 
social and economic backgrounds 
instead of instituting a system that 
encourages them to favor students 
from a certain end of the spectrum.

So before the Obama administra-
tion tries to implement an undevel-
oped plan that requires extensive 
time and funds, the values and costs 
should be placed in thought for 
some time. President Obama’s plan 
has good intentions, but the out-
comes don’t seem promising — at 
least, not for now.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor, 
President Clinton, once known 

for his love of fast food, has been 
making headlines for his recent 
dietary change. He’s swapped the Big 
Macs and chicken nuggets for veggie 
burgers, beans and vegetables. After 
years of battling heart problems, 
Clinton took his doctor’s advice to 
reduce his meat consumption. He 
reports that the results have been 
tremendous: losing 24 pounds, feel-
ing more energetic and seeing a wel-
come drop in cholesterol levels. 

President Clinton isn’t the only 
one turning over a new leaf; from 
Usher, to Oprah Winfrey,  Ellen 
DeGeneres and Kristen Bell, people 
everywhere are eating less meat.

The movement toward more 
plant-based meals is also taking 
root on college campuses, with 
more than 200 universities, includ-
ing UCSD, leading the charge with 
“Meatless Monday” campaigns in 
their dining halls. According to a 
study conducted by Technomic, 

over 20 percent of college students 
are reducing their meat consump-
tion and for good reasons.

One of those reasons is concern 
for the nine billion chickens, pigs 
and other animals raised for food 
each year, most of whom suffer in 
factory farms. For example, most 
egg-laying hens are crammed into 
tiny cages, each bird granted less 
space than the screen of an iPad on 
which to live for her entire life.

Thankfully, eating meatless 
doesn’t mean “less” at all. It means 
“more,” as in more choices. It means 
“better” as in better living — both 
for us and for animals. From chain 
restaurants like Chipotle and 
Denny’s serving up hearty vegetar-
ian fare, to Indian, Thai, Chinese 
and Mexican cuisine which regularly 
incorporate delicious meat-free 
items, the options are endless.

MeatFree for easy and delicious 
meat-free recipes and meal tips.

Landing a job post-graduation is enough to spawn a sigh of relief from any college student. Recent UCSD graduate Rachel Brown knows the feeling — and then some. Last April, after 
a six-month wait, the former Eleanor Roosevelt College student 
learned that she had been accepted into the Fulbright English 
Teaching Assistant Program. This sent her to Kinmen, Taiwan 
at the start of August to begin her 11-month term at Shyan An 
Primary School. 

Brown is one of 12 recent graduates from UCSD who received 
a grant this year from the Fulbright U.S. Student Program — a 
platform that gives individuals the opportunity to pursue aca-
demic study, research projects or English Teaching Assistantships 
abroad. This is the greatest number of grant recipients selected 
from UCSD on record. Fulbright is the nation’s largest exchange 
program of its kind, operating in over 140 countries and awarding  
roughly 1,900 grants each year . 

In addition to Taiwan, Fulbright grantees from UCSD have 
been flown out to work at multiple sites this academic year, includ-
ing Russia, Austria, Vietnam and Chile.

“When I found out I got the grant, I couldn’t stop smiling for at 
least 10 minutes,” Brown said.

Brown is currently a mile off the coast of China, on Taiwan’s 
outlying island of Kinmen, working with children in third through 
sixth grade — reading books, reviewing vocabulary words and 
playing games in the classroom.

“My classes are mostly supplemental English practice so [that] 
the students can have exposure to an all-English atmosphere with 
a native speaker,” Brown said.

Brown credits Fulbright and the Kinmen government’s com-
mitment to English education for making it possible for her to 
pursue her goal of helping children.

But her pursuit didn’t begin with her venture to Taiwan; Brown 
took a quarter off from school in 2011 to spend three months vol-
unteering as an English tutor at Gashora Girls Academy of Science 
and Technology in Rwanda.

“I enjoyed that so much that I thought teaching abroad again 
might prove an equally positive experience,” Brown said.

It’s been just shy of two months since leaving her hometown 
of Menlo Park to make her debut in Asia, but already, Brown feels 
that she had been right about her hunch.

“I’ve only just started, but so far, I really like it when I can see 
a little spark in my students,” Brown said. “Whenever they listen 
to my instructions, understand what I want and scoot forward in 
their seats, pencils poised, I feel like I’m succeeding.” 

While she’s experienced success in teaching her own language, 
Brown admitted that learning the native speech is still a work in 
progress. She estimated her level of fluency in Mandarin to be 
equivalent to that of her third graders’ English.

“I know tones, although I can’t always hear them, and I can say, 
‘Thank you,’ ‘Excuse me’ and ‘I want a passion fruit tea, large size’ 
— but that’s about it,” Brown said. “I hope to learn more Chinese 
soon, but I have to focus on teaching first. That’s my main priority.”

Effective communication with the locals may be a skill that 
Brown is far from mastering, but the language barrier hasn’t 
stopped her from learning about the native culture and its people 
— both in and out of the classroom.

“I’ve learned that Taiwanese garbage trucks play ice-cream-
truck-style music and that people are surprised I can use chop-
sticks. [I’ve learned] that being over 5’10” is extremely fascinating, 
that teaching is 20 percent knowing the material, 40 percent know-
ing your class and 40 percent faking it until something works,” 
Brown said. “[I’ve learned] that Chinese words are extremely dif-

UCSD Biologists Develop Faster Method for Identifying Antibiotics

In an effort to combat drug-resistant bacteria, UCSD molecular biologists Joseph Pogliano and Kit Pogliano have developed a shortcut for discover-ing new antibiotics and understanding how they are killed. They call it 
Bacterial Cytological Profiling.

Bacterial Cytological Profiling works as an autopsy for bacteria cells. It’s a fast 
way for scientists to show the specific effect an antibacterial drug has on bacteria 
cells by identifying what internal process the antibiotic disrupts in a bacterial cell.

 “A bacteria’s internal process is fairly simple — like an old computer — and how 
it crashes is how it crashes,” K. Pogliano said. “Consequently, in understanding the 
cause for bacterial death, we can better develop more effective drugs to help combat 
the increasingly drug-resistant bacteria.”

The BCP project began more than a decade ago when both professors were 
involved in early research on bacterial internal organization. Over time, they began 
to study antibiotic effects on cells and develop techniques to look at bacterial cells.

K. Pogliano said that she was compelled to pursue this project in order to 
move her research in a practical direction and help people with bacterial infections 
receive better treatments. According to K. Pogliano, her father once contracted a 
mixed-species infection that rendered him disabled. However, the development of 
BCP has brought her one step closer to helping people like her father.

“We have a small startup company that we have founded to make this technol-
ogy available to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to trying to make this a

more robust method that is faster and 
more applicable for early stage drug 
discovery,” K. Pogliano said.

Despite the achievements that the 
research team has made, K. Pogliano 
believes that there remains many chal-
lenges to face and questions to answer. 
She stated that BCP is still a relatively 
new process and that it is still unclear, 
if at least mechanistically, why the 
technique is so effective. Furthermore, 
K. Pogliano says another challenge is 
discovering the right molecules for the 
antibiotic. The difficulty, she stated, is 
that many molecules are unusable due 
to their toxicity or simply their inabil-
ity to pass through the liver’s filter.

However, in spite of these chal-
lenges, it appears that both the scien-
tific and pharmaceutical communities 
have been receptive towards BCP. K. 
Pogliano explained that before BCP, 
companies often had difficulties dis-
covering the mechanisms a drug uses 
to kill bacterial cells,  yet the FDA 

needed information on these mecha-
nisms in order to issue an approval. 
The results BCP provides can tell com-
panies what part of the bacterial pro-
cess antibiotics inhibit and speed up 
new drug development.

K. Pogliano expressed that they are 
always looking for motivated and dedi-
cated students from UCSD to assist in 
the lab. 

“Professor Joe Pogliano and I like 
to make sure that students have a really 
high quality environment to interact 
with a keen mentor,” she said.

In the future, K. Pogliano envisions 
a deeper understanding of bacterial 
cells. She hopes to identify new targets 
for drugs to attack on bacterial cells 
and develop effective new drugs to 
meet the pressing clinical need.

“It’s really fun,” she said. “I’m 
excited to show that basic science 
can have an impact on improving 
human health.”

ficult to pronounce correctly [and] 
that children have personalities that 
extend way past language barriers.” 

When she’s not teaching, Brown 
takes time to explore her new home. 
To make getting around the small 
island easier, she rented a scooter 
after getting her Taiwanese scooter 
license earlier this month.

“I wander around my town when 
looking for a place to eat dinner 
and point at foods I don’t know on 
menus to order sometimes,” Brown 

said. “You just adapt. It’s that, or give 
up, and I’ve never been the giving 
up type.”

Brown believes that it will take 
her a bit longer before she feels com-
pletely at home in Taiwan.

“I think it takes three months to 
love a country — one to explore and 
be excited, one to be disappointed 
that it isn’t home and one to accept 
that this place is growing on you and 
it might even be your new home,” 
she said. “The boundaries on when 
you switch between these emotions 
are pretty fluid, but at the moment, 

I am definitely happy. I think once I 
learn more Chinese, this will feel like 
a new home.”

Brown still has many more 
months to make herself comfortable 
in Taiwan before she returns to the 
states next July. 

“I’m looking forward to getting 
to know my students really well and 
also to traveling more,” Brown said. 
“I want to see the rest of the country 
when possible.”

days of their career when they tirelessly worked out 
of their home studios and complaining neighbors 
would knock on their doors. Following the trends and 
the tested routes of classic New York producers from 
the past, the pair would head straight from the studio 
to the club with a new fresh jam to test on the crowd 
in their DJ sets. They have since produced original 
material and remixes for Katy Perry and Marina & the 
Diamonds and have shared the stage with acts like 
Big Boi, Chromeo, and a tour with Ellie Goulding. Be 
prepared because The Knocks will be knocking at

In the Midwest, UCSD junior 
Tanner Collins finished 24th in 
a field of 458 runners. Collins — 
recording a time of 26:11 — led the 
pack for the Tritons pacing seniors 
Kellen Levy, Matt Lenehan and 
Mario Flores, all of whom finished 
within two seconds of each other.

On the women’s side, sophomore 
transfer Paige Hughes was UCSD’s 

top finisher with a time of 23:18, 
good for 20th place. Sophomore 
Marie Diaz finished in 32nd place, 
right in front of senior Ximena Cruz.

“Both of our leaders ran really 
well — Tanner Collins really put 
together a big time race, and Paige 
Hughes did a good handling the 
group,” Garcia said.    

In San Bernardino, the UCSD 
underclassmen had ample opportu-
nity to stretch their legs. Freshman 

Brendan Gee had an exceptional 
meet, finishing first overall with a 
time of 26:19. Sophomore Charles 
Morgan finished sixth overall for 
UCSD, junior Mike Kloha tracked 
right behind him to finish in eighth.

The Tritons’ next meet will be 
back at UCSD. October 12, UCSD 
hosts the Triton Classic.

bit, and that lead to some pretty 
timely counter attacks.”

In its third match this week, 
the team fell to UC Santa Barbara 
and was the Tritons’ worst offensive 
effort in the last seven games. The 
Division-I Gauchos proved difficult 
for the Tritons to handle after they 
outscored UCSD 5–4 in the opening 
quarter. The Gauchos launched a 

3–0 run in the second period, and 
the Tritons never came within three 
goals of UCSB — now 10–2 overall.

The Tritons are away for the bet-
ter part of a week before they return 
to Canyonview Aquatic Center to 
play nationally ranked No. 1 UCLA. 
The team will compete in the SoCal 
Tournament  next month.

The Triton water polo squad 
improved to 7–7 this week, going 
2–1 in the first three games of a four-
game home stand. UCSD outplayed 
Loyola Marymount University on 
Sept. 25 and the United States Naval 
Academy on Friday before falling to 

UC Santa Barbara 11–7 on Saturday.
The 14th-ranked Tritons shone 

in their Wednesday match against 
Western Water Polo Association 
rivals Loyola Marymount in front 
of a crowd of 1,639. UCSD, in its 
first match of the academic quarter, 
fell behind 2–1 after one quarter 
but had evened up the score at 
4–4 before halftime after a second-
quarter ejection allowed utility Joe 
Dietrich to score on a six-on-five 
advantage.

The Tritons went on a 7–3 run 
in the second half to close out the 
match 11–7.

In the Friday matchup against 

Navy, the Tritons trailed by two 
goals at halftime before explod-
ing for six third-quarter goals 
that ended up securing the 11–9 
win. Dietrich and junior Jeffery 
Jarvis scored three goals each, and 
goalkeeper Cameron Ravanbach 
notched 12 saves.

“We couldn’t play drive defense 
to save our lives,” head coach Denny 
Harper told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. 

“We had to make a change and 
put more pressure on the ball. We 
were able to wear them down a little

After losing its starting setter and its subsequent two matches, the UCSD women’s volleyball team is back on 
track, winning last weekend’s games against 
conference opponents Cal State Stanislaus and 
Chico State.

“We’re really happy, because it’s always 
tough playing on the road,” UCSD head coach 
Ricci Luyties said. “Winning on the road 
against Chico was a good result and a big kind 
of confidence boost after we’ve had a coupe 
losses. Now I think we’re back on the right 
track and had a lot of people play really well 
over the weekend.”

At the tail end of a seven-game road trip, 
UCSD traveled to Stanislaus last Friday and 
continued into the Central Valley the following 
day to face Chico State.

The Tritons took the sweep against Cal 
State Stanislaus to earn a comfortable 10th 
victory, with set scores of 25–19, 25–16 and 
25–21.

Usual suspects sophomore Danielle Dahle 
and junior Sara McCutchan provided the 
offense. Outside hitters Dahle and McCutchan 
earned nine and seven kills respectively. But 
senior Lizzy Andrews, who has played limited 
minutes early in the season, stood out for the 
Tritons on the night, recording 10 kills on just 
two errors along with 10 blocks.

The following day, the Tritons squared off 
with Chico State — the third school fighting 
for second place in the conference against 

UCSD and Sonoma State — and took down the 
Wildcats to jump up in the CCAA standings.

Chico took the first set handily, taking 
seven unanswered points to go up early 25–20. 
The Wildcats’ Lindsey Quigley — the top scor-
er on the night with 17 overall kills — picked 
up six kills in the opening set.

In the second set, UCSD notched 14 kills 
to Chico State’s 10 to grab the 25–18 win. In 
similar fashion, the Tritons outperformed the 
Wildcats in the subsequent sets to finish the 
match strong.

Against Chico, the Tritons generated 
offense from around the court. Newcomer 
junior transfer Caitlin Brenton and sophomore 
Kameron Cooper picked up nine kills each, 
while McCutchan and Dahle recorded 13 and 
14 kills, respectively.

When asked, Luyties said he was impressed 
with the performance, noting that sophomore 
setter Heidi Sierks did well to move the ball 
around the court.

“Heidi did a good job distributing the ball 
to everybody,” Luyties said. “We got pretty 
good performances out of everybody, keeping 
Chico guessing on where we were coming from 
at the net.”

The Tritons head back on the road to face 
Cal State Stanislaus next Thursday, Oct. 3 and 
Humboldt State on Saturday, Oct. 5.

CROSS   COUNTRY

The UCSD cross country team 
split its ranks last weekend between 
the Roy Griak Invitational in Falcon 
Heights, Minn. and the Coyote 
Invitational in San Bernardino, 
Calif.

In Minnesota, both the men’s 
and women’s teams finished in fifth 
place, while back on the West Coast, 

the men placed first and the women 
placed fourth.

“We were really happy with the 
team’s performance,” UCSD head 
coach Nate Garcia said. “The [Roy 
Griak Invitational] was a big time 
meet, and the team handled [itself] 
really well, and I was very pleased 
to come back with the finishes that 
we got.”
