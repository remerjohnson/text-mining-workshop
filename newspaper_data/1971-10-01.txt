u.c. Student lobby in Sacramento 
Reorganized, Now Student-Run 

Debbie Lor.nder 
Lobbying is nothing new in Sacramento 

- but for the small staff of the U. C. 
Student Lobby, it is not only new, it is 
frantic. 

With only three people and just $40,000 to 
work with, the lobby is trying to protect 
students' interest in the State Legislature. 
Paul Gassaway and Kati Perry, both UC 
Santa Barbara graduates, recently took 
over the office as co - coordinators after 
working there last summer. Tbey have 
ambitious plans for the future of the lobb , 
but their plans all hinge on the " interest 
and participation of the students," sa s 
Gassaway. 

The two coordinators are trying to set up 
" lobby annexes" on each of the nine UC 
campuses. These annexes would be staffed 
by students, and would serve as the focal 
point for information about legislation 
currently being considered which affects 
students, as well as the activities of the 
lobby on the students' behalf. 

The other important function of the lobby 
annex would be to gauge student opinion 
about the lobby and its policies. Gassaway 
hopes to conduct a referendum through the 
annexes to determine how students feel 
about the lobby and whether they want to 
support it. 

Gassaway also envisions the lobby 
annexes as a training ground for students 
who want to go to Sacramento as interns 
for a quarter under the new Student Lobby 
Advocacy Program. " The student could do 
research into one of the fields related to 
lobby efforts such as conflict of interest on 
the Board of Regents, the state Master 
Plan for Higher Education, sex 
discrimination in the university, or the 
EOP program. After a quarter of such 
research, the student would go to 
Sacramento as an intern, and he would be 
our expert on that particular field .• 

The interns will find themselves in 
direct contact with legislators in 
Sacramento. According to Gassaway, the 
lobby s procedures involve more than just 
licking envelopes for the student who 
wishes to learn something about practical 
politics:" An intern who js interested in a 
certa in problem would find out first what 
legi lation is being considered on the 
subject, and go to see someone whose 
committee is involved. He tells them. 
'There are 125,000 UC students who are 
concerned about their passage of this bill.' 
Then when the measure goes to the floor 
for di cussion, we lobby the people who are 
key to the vote on the floor. " 

If there is no bill , the lobby draws one up 
and fi nds a legislator who will sponsor it. 

Students who wish to spend a quarter at 
the lobby office in Sacramento can get 
credit for their efforts through the School 

Student lobby Success 

of Public Administration at UCLA, or 
through Special Studies courses on their 
own campus. They also receive a $75 a 

month stipend for expenses, and will be 
provided with a place to live in dorms at 
either Sacramento Stale or U Davis. 
Those interested in the program should 
contact UCSD student body president Paul 
Kaufman .... 

The Student Lobby is also involved in an 
effort to coordinate all the colleges in 
California into one large lobby group. The 
California Student Lobby. This would 
involve 20 state colleges, 83 junior colleges, 
and 89 private colleges. The California 
Student Lobby, then , would consist of a 
total of about 975.000 tudents, a figure 
which Gassawa y thinks could not fail to 
impre the legi lature in Sacramento. 
. 'They are very re pectful of the potential 
of the lobby to influence student - and the 
wa s in which thev will vote ." he 
explain d ·· If they were to see a rna sive 
student registration effort, they would be 
impressed - this is what they are watching 
for.·' The statewide student lobb , then 
would greatly increase the effects of the 
student voting potential on the legi Lators. 
The statewide lobby is presently oni in the 
planning stages but Paul Kaufman, who is 
very involved with the effort to form it, 
peculates that it may come into existence 

within the next four or five months. The UC 
lobby would then simply merge with the 
statewide group. 

According to Gassaway, the tudent 
lobbyists have met with great success in 
Sacramento. " We have people of every 
political per sua ion, from a clean-cut 
Davi fraternity man to a long haired 
barefoot anta Barbara Yippie. The 
legislators are very receptive and will talk 
to us any time, because they are very 
impressed with the idea of a tudent lobby 
organization - they never see students 
actually working. Even the most 
conservative ones find the time to include 
us on their calendar if we want to see 
them." 

Ga sawa is very enthu iastic and 
optimi tic 'about the ·future of th lobby, 
and urge tud nts to get involved with 
both the campu annexe and later a 
interns in acramento. He i counting on 
more financial suppart from the AS C

to the Vaughan Aquarium -
Museum at UCSO's Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. 
"Since Scripps Institution is a 
leader in the oceanographic 
research would and its 
aquarium - museum is one of 
only two in this country, we 
are, privileged to make our 
contribution to its continuing 
education of youth and the 
public in general, " said bank 
president Alden W. Johnson. 

Third College 

The gift will provide for 
construction of a 13 - foot 
channel to show how ocean 
waves are formed and the 
hiring of a museum scientist to 
help develop exhibits. A portion 
of the funds will be used to 
make career experience 
awards to high school and 
college students. 

The aquarium - museum is 
open to the public daily 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. without charge. 

Begins Minority 
Informotion Compoign 

Dr. Joseph Watson, Provost 
of Third College has announced 
a month-long campaign aimed 
at informing minority 
youngsters of the admissions 
criteria of the University. 

In order to qualify for 
regular admission, students 
must have earned at least a B 
average in each of several 
specified subject areas: all 
must have taken at least one 
year of history and lab science 
and two years of math and 
foreign language. Of the high 
school students in the state who 
meet these requirements 
(usually around 12 '12% of aLI 
California high school 
students), only the smallest 
percentage comes from the 
Black, Brown, and other 
minority communities. 

"Once they are given the 
chance to do college work , 
minority students have proven 
that they can succeed," says 
Watson. ." Minority students 
admitted to the University of 
California have established an 
enviable record , wi th over 90 
percent of those enrolled in 
special programs rema.ining 
until graduation ... thIS IS 
particularly significant if you 
compare it to the 60% 
completion rate for the rest of 
the undergraduate college 
population. " 

UCSD is currently able to 
admit a small number of 
minority students who do not 
qualify under the normal 
requirements by applying for 
the University ' s special 
admissions waiver, which is 
reserved for four per cent of 
the freshman class. 

" If the University is ever to 
achieve its goal of offering 
quality education to Significant 
numbers of minority youth, 
more rea listic changes will 
have to be made in the 
admissions procedure ," 
Watson said. At the same time, 
he feels that "every step must 
be laken to increase the pool of 
minority youth admissable 
under the regular criteria. and 
the first step has to be one of 
informing students of what 
those criteria are."

McGovern for President Fellowships Estoblished For U(SD Students 
Committee Orgonized Here 

The George McGovern campaign has come to UCSD with the 
formation of the UCSD McGo\'ern for President Committee. 
The goals of the committee are to see Senator McGovern 
elected in the Democratic primary and then in the Presidential 
elections in 1972. Currently volunteers are being sought to help 
in the areas of fund raising. literature distribution, and 
organizing an area-wide publicity campaign. 

Voter Registration Week (Oct. 18-23) is the first campus 
activity being sponsored by the McGovern for President 
Committee. It will be a non-partisan campus function directed 
primarily toward getting the campus community registered 
for the upcoming national elections. Deputy registrars are 
needed to staff the registration tables. Volunteers must be over 
21. Senator McGovern is running as an "anti-charismatic" 
candidate. He stands ratfier upon his self-styled image of 
"honesty and frankne s. " according to UCSD McGovern 
campaign spokeswoman Pat Sawyer. One of hi s latest stands 
involves immediate amnesty for all draft resisters currently in 
prison. He favors the sale of arms to Israel. linking this 
position with that of his stand on " peace.' · 

Senator McGovern stated. ·' It is the obligation of those of us 
who have led the peace movement in thi country to educate 
our constituents to the vital distinction between preventing 
war in the Mideast by placing the American guarantee behind 
Israel' s right to survive. and perpetuating the war in Indochina 
by fighting the internal struggles of the people of that area for 
an indeFinite period of time with American troops and pilots." 

George McGovern was one of the first senators to reject the 
United States Indochina policy on the floor of the Senate. He is 
the author of the McGovern-Hatfield bill and intends to 
re-introduce it during this session of Congress. McGovern ' 
main effort now. though, seem to be directed toward placing 
his name on the Democratic Party ti cket in November next 
year. Democratic Party profes ionals ·are gen rally backing 
Muskie, which means that the George McGovern campaign 
still has a long way to go. All students who are interested in the 
George McGovern campaign may contact Pam Sawyer at 
room 341 . 250 MC. 

New to UCSD this fall is the 
"Provosts' Tutorial Fellowship 
Program" which is sponsored

highly qualified academically 
and interested in teaching. 

Each quarter 100 
undergrad uates will be 
selected on the basis of their 
demonstrated competence in 
either specific math-science 
matter , or in courses 
demanding high skill in English 
reading and rhetoric. Sixty-five 
"math-science" tutors, and 
thirty-five .. reading and 
rhetoric" tutors will be chosen 
for a total of 100 tutorial 
fellows each term . 

If you are interested 
inmbecoming a Tutorial 
Fellow tor the Winter or Spring

Wage and 
Price Freeze 

For the past several years the economy of this 
country has progressed from "sluggish" to 
ruinously inflationary and severely misdirected. 
Many in government for years had been 
advocating wage and price controls in an eHort to 
end the wage-price spiral. President Nixon, until 
very recently, had seen this solution as contrary to 
the principle of free enterprise. Yet in August, 
after several consecutive months of large rises in 
the cost of living indexes, and in an apparent eHort 
to "defuse" another campaign issue, the President 
initiated a freeze on wages and prices. 

Laudible in its purist sense, this Administration 
version of wage-price controls only serves to 
exaggerate the already appalling distan~e 
between America's wealthy and poor, Its 
corporations and consumers. The .10 per cent 
surcharge on imports, for example, IS clearly the 
peHy sour grapes of an automobile industry seeing 
its customers lured away by the popular a~d 
relatively inexpensive foreign models. And while 
wages are frozen, gas and oil company profits are 
not. 

College students are also being seriously 
handicapped by the freeze . Higher tuition rates are 
exempt from the controls although, for the most 
part, they did not go into effect ~ntil after the 
freeze was announced. Scholarship and grant 
money has often been cut or has been spread 
thinner over a greater number of people, Interest 
rates on loans are again exempt from the freeze 
and have consequently gone up. And if a student 
decides to work instead of, or in addition to 
borrowing money for his education, he finds his 
wages frozen. 

The TRITON TIMES deplores the "trick~e 
down" theory upon which the current economic 
controls are based. While strong measures are 
necessary to jog the economy into h~alth, these 
measures will only be successful .f they are 
accompanied by a reordering of national economic 
priorities. The burden of recovery must not be 
entirely shouldered by consumers, wage ear~ers 
and students, but equally by the large corporations 
and industries as well.

TWO VIEWS ON FROZEN WAGES 
The Wage Freeze 

and the War 
by Tony lIod~es 

LJCSn YSA 

Nixon's wage freeze has 
nothing whatever to do with an 
e ra of " prosperity without 
war" . One of the effects of the 
freeze will be that the second-
class status of the 
underprivileged will be frozen 
with wages. White males' 
average annual income is 
$5.980; Black males get $3 .829 ; 
white females $2.019 and Black 
fema les $1 .688. The wage 
freeze prevents women from 
getting equal pay with men and 
perpetuates raci s t 
di scrimination against Blacks 
a nd Chicanos. Another effect o[ 
the freeze is that real wages 
will go down. In other word s 
the amount that frozen money 
wages will buy will fall -
because prices will go up , 
despite all the eyewash and 
hullaballoo abou t a price 
freeze. The price freeze is a 
fraud from beginning to end. 
Between 1941 and 1945 during 
the World War II " price 
freeze ". the consumer price 
index rose 22 per cent. even 
though there was a big 
government·appointed price· 
control board which was 
supposed to police prices. 

ixon has not even set up such 
a board. Furthermore the 
prices of fo reign·made goods 
are exempt from the freeze and 
have been exemp ted from the 
freeze . Tui ton and rents have 
been allowed to rise - check 
out the Housing office! 

Greedy Workers 
The government claims that 

inflation is due to greedy 
workers squeezing enormous 
wage out of their employees. 
Nothing could be further from 
the truth. Real wages - i.e. 
wages after taxes and price 
rises have been taken into 
account - have fallen since 
1965. Wages have not b en able 
to keep up with the inflation ! 

The War 
The war has caused the 

inflation. Before the escalation 
of the war. between 1958 and 
1964 . the con umer price index 
rose only 1.3 p r cent per year. 
But in 1964·65. as Johnson 
escalated the war, the price 
index ro 1.7 per cent. it rose 
2.9 per cent in 1965·66: 2.8 per 

cent in 1966-67 ; 4.2 per cent in 
1967·68; 5.4 per cent in 1968·69 ; 
5. 9 per cent in 1969·70; and 5.5 
per . cent in 1970-71. The 
massive increase in military 
expenditures from 49.9 billion 
in 1964 to over 80 billion 
projected for 1972 has been 
accompanied by a huge 
increase in the size of the 
federal government deficit to 
over 20 billion by 1971. It has 
bee n t hi s c ontinuou s 
government deficit financing of 
the huge mili tary outlays 
needed to terrorize the 
Vietnamese into submission 
that ha s overheated the 
economy and caused inflation. 

The government and the big 
corporations whose interests 
are at stake in the Vietnam 
War are responsible for the 
infl atio n . But with a 
kaleidoscope of deceit and 
conscious confusion these very 
same criminals blame the 
inflation on the American 
people who have nothing to 
gain from the Vietnam War or 
a wage freeze. 

November 6 
Building a massive antiwar 

movement is now more 
important than ever . The 
demonstrations called by the 
' ational P eace Action 

Coalition (N PACI to take place 
in 16 cities - including Los 
Angeles - on November 6 
promise to be even larger than 
those held in Washington and 
San Francisco last April 24th. 
One reason is that labor unions 
are coming out agai nst the war 
more and more as they 
discover that the war-caused 
inflation and wage freeze begin 
to erode the rea I wages of their 
members. Big unions like the 
United Auto Workers and the 
teamsters are now against the 
war. The antiwar movement 
now ha s the opportunity to 
mobilize hundred s of thousands 
of Union members in the 
streets on ovember 6th, 
demanding "Out now !" The 
Young Sociali t Alliance will 
be throwing all of its weight 
behind these demonstrations to 
make them the success that 
they can become. Join us! 

STARVATION IS GOOS 
WM OF PUNISHING 

THOSE WHO HAVE 
UTTt£ OR NO FAITH 

IN CAPITAlISM ... 

Diocletian, Richard, 
Galbraith and Frigidity 

Karl Kealin~ 
To mimic what congr.essman 

Richard Nixon said about Alger 
Hiss during the famed fIlss . 
Chambers case : " If the 
American people understood 
the real character of the wage · 
price freeze , they would boil 
the President in oil ." And they 
would tar, feather, draw, and 
quarter the liberals whose 
political pressures were tbe 
proximate cause of the freeze . 

Why? Because the freeze, 
from its birth in the liberal 
ranks of Congress to its 
implementation by the Newest 
Nixon , has been merely a 
political move. And , what is 
worse, it is an economic hoax. 

The President' s earlier 
economic policies had been 
working (the indices showed 
that ), but tbey had been 
working so slowly that the 
Democrats - especially those 
with stars in their eyes - could 
make " political hay." Wbat 
Nixon did , or course, was to 
slip into a phone booth , don his 
Tricky Dick disguise, and 
emerge with the controls that 
the liberals had been 
demanding 7 In current 
parlance, Nixon had " co-
opted" the donkeys. Not to be 
outdone, the Democrats 
retorted by nit-picking : 
arguing that this or that should 
or should not be exempt from 
controls . 

What is at stake, of course, is 
November 1972. Contrary to 
left·wing predictions, the 
President has , evidently, 
deciderl that he just cannot 
outright cancel the elections. 
So. in his inimitable style, he is 
going to make a run for it. 
Aside from the new China 
policy, his first big move was 
the freeze . With at least a 
dozen Democrats queued at the 
starting gate, Nixon realized 
that his moves had to be 1) eye· 
ca tching and 2) first. 
Politically he has been playing 
as he has always played : to 
win. And so far he is leading. 

Liberals cum Socialists 
But what also concerns us 

he r e are the economic 

ramifications of the New 
Economic Policy. (If Nixon 's 
advisors had more historical 
sense, tbey never would have 
chosen that fateful name.) The 
liberals and the socialists have 
been telling us for some time 
(the socialists have been telling 
us rougbly forever) that we 
must have a controlled 
eConomy if we are to escape 
Armageddon. If the liberals 
and socialists agree on 
anything. it would be that the 
government should mind 
everyone's economic business 
as much as possible. 

Tbe trouble, however, is that 
the liberals and their friends on 
the fringe lack an under· 
standing of history . No wage 
and price controls have ever 
worked ; economies have 
remained stable only so long as 
they have . been free from 
govern'mental intervention . 
Once the government steps in 
and demands that every 
economic venture halt in its 
tracks, tbe delicately balanced 
mechanism that is the free 
market begins to tilt and sway 
unmercifully . And if 
governmental intervation is too 
great, the economy will 
collapse . Ever sin ce 
Diocletian began fooling 
around with the economy, such 
controls have - with the 
predictability of the next 
sunrise - unanimously failed . 

Jejtllle EcoHmlCl 
What the liberals fail to 

realize is that the so . called 
wage and price spiral does not 
cause inflation ; it is merely a 
result of inflation. As such. 
attacking the spiral is not 
synonymous with attacking 
inflation. 

If the government in 
Washington did not continually 
increase the money supply(and 
it does this in several ways), 
then the wages and prices 
would quickly stabilize. 
Inflation Occurs when the 
government puts money into 
circulation faster than the

Dearth in Venice Art Happenings 
David 8vchbmd., ond Corrie Ifjckie 

In tile movie "Little Mllrders" there Is a scene where Elliott 
Gould returns home for tbe first time in five years. He bas 
neither wrluu nor ad any other form of communication with 
bis parents over these years, but tbe first tbing his artsy 
parents say to him as he enters the door is: "How would you 
like to see the new Visconti movie? He's a fabulous director. 
It's playing at the Art Tbeatre." 

Luchlno Visconti , known for his " Rocco and His Brothers" 
and "Tbe Damned" is, undeniably, a fabulous director. His 
movies are impeccably edited, beautifully photograpbed, and 
have excellent music. 

All these Visconti characteristics are present in bis latest 
movie , " Deatb in Venice ," wbich is playing at the Capri 
Theatre on University and Park. " Deatb in Venice" stars Dirk 
Bogarde as the aging and sickly Gustav Ascbenbach. 
Aschenbach, Thomas Mann's portrait of tbe artist as an elderly 
man, In his novella "Death In Venice" was a pastiche of many 
artists of Mann's day. However, in tbe movie one is led to 
believe that Gustav Mabler is the gentleman that Visconti 
portrays as Ascbenbach. 

Mahler's third and flftb sympbonies provide tbe music for 
the film, and Venice, amazingly througb some filter process or 
another, looks clean and cool. The Hotel des Bains on tbe Lido 
is tbe place where most of tbe drama takes place: Aschenbacb 
floats into Venice wltb Mabler's fifth symphony playing t.. tile 
background. He eyes an amazing young DIan/ boy (Bjorn 
Andresen), tbe son of a Polisb family of all women. There are 
several flashback sequences wbere we learn of the 
Aschenbacb/ Mabler tragedies and trt..ls (first visit to a boose 
of ill reptlte, bis daugbter's death, his music being Ignored by 
an audience). The most interesting of tbe flasbbacks is a scene 
where Ascbellbacb is argul.g wltb a colleague about art. 
Ascbenbacb Illsists that art is perfectly clear. His colleague 
laughs and says art is, must be, ambiguous. His colleague 
piercingly laugbs. 

The sadistic laugh is used much duriag the movie, and it 
seems Visconti was speaking the words of Ascbenbacb's 
colleague: art must be ambiguous. 

" Death in Venice" was ambiguous. " Death in Venice" was 
obscure. But many will refuse to see it because tbey dOIl't like 
enigmatic films - films they must needs tbink about. " Death 
in Venice" lagged a great deal. 

Many of tbe scenes appear to have been filmed with Kalka 
more in mind than Mann. However, the final scene is more 
than wortb the two-hour wait. It is a most exceptional sceDe, 
and " Death in Venice" sbould be seen, if only for tbis final 
scene. It is unfortunate that the San Diego community will not 
pay to see an " art" film.

La Jolla Cove when Robert 
Grosvenor's Floating Sculpture 
for La Jolla. a commissioned 
pi'ece of kinetic scu lpture for 
the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art. was placed 
about 200 feet from the 
shoreline. The museu m's 
assistant director, Lawrence 
l:Irrutia . remark ed that 
Gro sve nor 's work is 
representative of many of 
today's artists who like to 
create work s und e r a 
museum 's sponsorship. but 
prefer their pieces of art to be 
viewed outside of the museum 
wall s. 

Grosvenor's work . eotitled 
" Kinetic Ocean Piece". is his 
first Pacific Ocean work . and it 
may be viewed by telescope 
from inside the museum at 700 
Prospect Street in La Jolla. 

Also on exhibit at .the 
museum are several examples 
of untitled " Torn Bag Art" by 
Jerry McMillan. These pieces 
of art illustrate nature and life 

, 

seen through the botton and 
sides of a torn bag. Beans, 
wrinkled pa per bags, flowers 
and bank s a re cleverl y 
rep roduced by photographs of 
the bags themselves. 

Upstairs at the museum 
there are many Billy AI 
Bengston aluminum / resin 
interpretations of " The 
Alamo," along with a pair of 
Bengston lithographs. 

In the main ga llery is an 
eerie collection of Philip 
Guston pa intings that could 
a lmo st be cons id ered 
whimsical if one didn 't notice 
the subject matter : Ku Klux 
Klansmen with fingers that 
transform into pistols a nd who 
ca rt about truckloads of bodies 
(one sees only the fee t) in their 
mauve trucks. The colors are 
as startling as the SUbjects in 
the paintings: hooded white

Southern sky. 

These four exhibits will be on

" Imagine" J ohn Lennon and 

the Plastic One Band (with flux 
fiddlers Apple SW 3379 ): John 
Lennon's latest effort as a solo 
artist. Though hyped a uch. 
" Imagine" is anything but a 
solo album. Produced by the 
Lennons, John and Yoko. with 
Phil Spector. master of th 
" wall·of·sound " approach to 
stud io recording from his old 
days with Ike and Tina 
Turner. the album features 
such artists as George 
Harrison on guitars. Klau 
Voorman on bass. the late King 
Curtis on saxophone, and icky 
Hopkins (Quicksilver. Rolling 
Stones, etc. ) on piano. 

Lennon. as with his first 
album . tends toward laying his 
per so nal side bare b y 
displaying his deepest feelings 
and emotions in the words of 
his songs . For example , his 
bitterness. if it can be called 
such concerning the break·up 
of the Beatles and his feelings 
toward Paul McCartney are 
revea led on side two in "How 
Do You Sleep?" The me sag 
to Paul : " You live with 
straights who tell you you was 
king Jump when your momma 
tell you anything The only 
thing you done was 
yesterday And since you 're 
gone you 're just another 
day How do ~'ou sleep? Ah . 
how do you sleep at night?" 
John concludes the album with 

a toe·tapping. easy song 
written to Yoko and celebrates 
the love that they have . 

" Imagine" contain po ibly 
the best post· BeatIe material 
on record. though George 
Harrison freaks. of whom I am 
one. may still find themselve 
partial to " All Things Must 
Pass." " Imagine" is nice to 
listen to and good to have in a 
collection. It comes complete 
with a picture po ter of John 
and two post cards. each with a 
picture of John holding a pig by 
the ears. The picture reminds 
me of something . 

Also on Capitol records, 
"Rock Love" Steve Miller 
Band (Capitol W·748 ): after a 
recent concert in I\'ew York . a 
friend of mine put it very 
succinctly. " They were 
supposed to be the hi t of the

came on. the crowd completely 
forgot about Steve Miller. " 
" Roc~ Love" ha a lotofmu ic

Country Music Two Views

Arts W,ite, 
A Shadow Away 

(Continued on page 6) 

Cou ntry mu ic is like Mexica n food . If you makes for a rather hard·to-listen·to album , but 
were brought up on it. you dig it. if not , you have Poco fans might dig it. 
to get used to it. There a re many levels of 
country mu ic one ca n approach : from the 
h.ard-core classics all the way to the country· 
tinged folk·rock at the other side. 

Poco's new rel e a se. " From ' th e 
Inside".(EPIC/CBS ) could best be ca lled 
midd le-of· the· road country music. In the past 
the group has leaned towards a country,folk 
SOund. using the Buffalo Springfield tyle as a 
background for the pia iner Iyrici m typical of 
COu ntry music. " From the Inside" is a step 
away from thi s idea : the music. including 
plenty of nine and 11 chords and rhythmic 
surprises. is combined with subtler lyrics than 
those on Poco's first album , " Pickin ' Up the 
Pieces". I think this combination ill·matched : 
the hading of the word·meaning is 
overpowered by the intricacy of the mllsic (a in 
" Bad Weather"!. and there is more than a 
touch of commercialism present as well. as in . 
for example. " Do You Feel It Too? " This 

Another sound. one a little closer to the 
traditional side of country mu sic. is that of Kri s 
Kristofferson 's " Me And Bobby McGee" 
(Monument/CBS ) . 

Kristofferson seems like a mix of Johnn y 
Cash. Gordon Li~hUoot, Tim Hardin. and a 
pinch of post·" Nashvilie Skyline" Dylan - the 
ingredients are well·blended and the result is 
individualists rather than plagiaristic . His 
presentation is natural and holds the intimacy 
of a coffee·hou set. with some additional 
orchestration. The song range from an ice· 
broken participation number. " Blame it on the 
Stone~." through Cash·style talkillfl blues.( " To 
Beat The Devil") and homey moralism 
(" Darby's Castle"). Kristofrerson continu s 
with the despondency of lost·love blues with 
" For the Good Times". " Me and Bobby 
McGee" i a ROod, easy. clsual listen. and it 
provides a good initiation to the country style. 

In 1969 Joni Mitchell sang of 
the bomb rs being turned into 
bu tterflies in her song of

Sailing Club Launches Season 
All right, man, if you 're really on the 

sailing thing, then you're at the right 
place, so take heed to the following 
words. Bert (that's Mr. Kobayashi to 
you freshmen ) and Mike (sailing 
instructor ) Orbach have quite a scene 
going with the all new, no enzyme. 
sailing club. 

Now, the sailing club is very much 
open to anybody, can you dig it? What 
this means is that you, Joe Nothing, can 
truck right in on the meeting 
Wednesday, Oct. 6, at 7:30 p.m. in USB 
3010, and lay your sailing demands right 
on the club member 's teaky heads. 
Believe it, you won't get jibbed off by 
anyone, but like all establishment 
organizations there are a cou ple of 
slight hitches. 

One is that you must pay a $6 fee , and 
the other is that you pass a swim test. 
Now before you make some disgustingly 

Andy E,tabrook 
Sports Writer 

obscene gesture and turn to the Arts 
page, let me set you straight on just 
what is happening. The reason for the 
swim test is obvious, I mean, what if you 
fall out? If you can 't swim then you 
obviously won 't be able to catch up with 
the boat. By missing the boat and 
drowning or whatever you cause the 
University a major hassle. Not on ly 
would they have to relocate the boat, 
they 'd have to drag the bottom for vou . 

Anyway, the fee makes you a real 
member of the Na utical ASSOCiation, 
which means you then have access to the 
boats and facilities . The " boats" consist 
of the following : six (count 'em, six ) 
sabots , two Lehman lO's. one Flying Jr. . 
one Malibu Outrigger, one Flying 
Dutchman. 

The facilities , boathouse, etc. , are 
located on Santa Clara Ct. in Mission 
Beach, about seven miles from campus. 

TIIese groovy boot boats are available 
Friday, Saturday. and Sunday from 10 to 
four, but, as a word to the wise, caU488-
3642 during the hours and reserve a boat 
for an hour or two. Don 't get to thinking 
you 're hot yet. because the first time 
you go to check. out a boat you might be 
asked by Big Mike to show you know 
what 's happening (for the straights out 
there that means " show some basic 
skill") . 

Well . that's the way it is, kiddies, so 
stop by USB 3010 Wednesday evening 
and have some meaningful dialogue with 
the sailing people. I wouldn 't try to con 
you - it would be cool to go and rap 
about anything that has to do with 
sailing, such as advanced sailing 
classes, last year 's parties, this year 's 
parties, beginning sailing classes, the 
intercollegiate team. and next year's 
parties. 

Harriers Return to Action The cross·country learn starts off with a fla h Saturdav in probably the most important and exciting meet of the young year. UCSD harriers will be hosting a tournament on Saturaay 
morning at 11. The meet will take place on the 4.65 mile cro 
country course on the nor thea t corner of Matthews campus 
along Miramar Road. 

Mark U.ka 
Sports Writer 

Despite th skill and experience of the present team. Coach 
Skief expressed some concern over the lack of depth of this 
year's squad. He did mention that any student wishing to join 
the team. especially freshmen . would be greatly appreciated. 

Aside from this aturday's meet there are some other 
interesting confron tation coming up . Meets scheduled here on 
the San Diego campus include a league meet OcL 15 against 
powerful Biola . and aga inst two good leams. Pasadena and 
LoyCila . on Oct. 30. There will also b a tough away meet 
against Chapman and Azusa Pacific on 0 t. 9 at the Azusa 
Pacific field . 

All things considered. the team should hat-e a succes ful 
ason and Coach Skief is looking forward to starling on the 

right foot with a victory Saturday on his home track.

For those intrepid souls still interested in playing on a UCSD. 
intercollegiate football team there will be an important 
meeting in the conference room on !be north side of the gym 
Wednesday. Oct. 6. at 7 p.m. The agenda will consist primarily· 
of setting up a spring practice schedule and ironing out 
financial difficulties. Contrary to rumor , lhere is no chance for 
any football this quarter, and according to Coaches Frank 
Vitale and Andy Skier. if less than 40 experienced athletes show 
up, there won't be much chance for spring practice either. II 
you're interested but unable 10 attend them contact either of 
the lwo coaches sometime before the meeting in the gym 
offices. 

Coach Barry Cunningham has big plans for the basketball 
team and ha called a few meetings in hope of gelling lhe show 
on the road. For those interested in playing varsily basketball 
there will be an organizational meeting in the gym conference 
room on Monday, Oct. 4. at5 p.m. the following day, same time 
and place, there will be a meeting for those more modest 
fellows interested in playing junior·varsity ball . 

Now, for something really dilferent. anyone interested in 
playi ng in a pep band fOF the home basketball games this year 
should contact Coach Cunningham at X2275. It seemed many of 
the students and most of the team members, particularly those 
on the bench, felt the rooters section left somelhing to be 
desired last year. However. as demonstrated by UC Davis at 
the Al1-Cal Tourney. a pep band generales a radically different 
atmosphere than the one the reserved UCSD fan is accustomed 
to, and at the same time is a lot of fun for those avid athletic 
supporters directly involved . 

Then for the real man (and the slightly insane ), two sports 
stand in front of the rest: crew and rugby. For those interested 
in rowing their arms olf for the glory of UCSD there will be a 
meeting on Tuesday Oct. 5. at 6 p.m. in the gymnasium 
classroom. And for those interested in th sport that takes 
leather balls, leave your name in the PE office or put a phone 
call in to X2275 to receive further information.

Ghosts of the Past 
by I'aul Gassaway and Kali I'erry 

UC Siudeni Lobbyis l 

It is difficult to imagine in lhe context of the 
present day, the Frankenstenian legislation that 
friends of higher education faced in the 
California Legislature in the spring of 1969 -
and friends were few during that time. The 
sheer physical amount of anti-University, anti-
student legislation was staggering. Over 100 
bills dealing with campus disruptions alone 
were introduced in the Senate and Assembly. 
Nearly all of the bills would have dramatically 
changed the climate of higber education in 
California - some would have destroyed it 
entirely. 

Looking at the bills that came within a few 
voles of passage, they seem humorous to,day . 
And humorous they are because they failed to 
become law. Here are a few examples of what 
some legislators hoped would "weed out those 
outside trouble makers and spineless 
administrators. " 

Senate Bill 309, introduced by Senator 
Schmi~z, ~ould have created a campus Safely 
Commlsslo~ for the sole purpose of quelling 
campus dIsorder. The committee of fine 
persons, appointed entirely by the Governor for 
four-year terms, would have been empowered 
to dismiss any academic or non-academic 
employee who it found had committed an act of 
violence or force on university or college 
property. However, the bill contained an even 
worse provision : The Committee not 
responsible to anyone, could discharg'e any 
preSident, chancellor, dean or other 
administrative office of educational institutions 
who failed " to exercise his authority errectively 
to curb acts of force or violence on the campus 
where he is employed. " 

Regardless of the situation if The 
Commission had found an administ~ator whose 
actions were ineffective (in the judgement of 
whom?), they could remove him without 

recourse; wha~ver. Amazing and funny , unlil 
you reahze that It was meant seriously. 

In another bill, AB 1286 by The sub-i:ommittee 
on educational environment, the Chancellor or 
President of any university or college would 
have been required, not allowed to take 
disciplinary action against any perso~ convicted 
of a crime arising out of a campus disturbance. 
The bill also provided that any student on state 
financial academic assistance who commits 
"any act likely to disrupt the peaceful conduct 
of the campus activities" shall ha\'e such aid 
suspended and be ineligible for renewal of such 
aid for two academic years. 

The scope and breadth of the bills during this 
period is fascinating. The list could go on and 
on. There was even a bill inlroduced that would 
have built a wall with cracked glass at the top, 
around every UC campus. 
. It is also. interestin~ to note those legislators 
lO\'olved With these bills . Included in the honor 
role ~re such notables as Bob Monogan, 
mlOonty leader in the Assembly and Bob 
Moretti , the present speaker of the Assembly. 
Few legislators resisted the wave of hysteria . 
Two Assemblymen, who were courageous 
enough to withstand it, were Frank Murphy 
(Santa Cruz) and Craig Biddle (Riverside) in 
the sub-i:ommittee on criminal procedures. 

But times have rapidly clfanged. With tbe vote 
and the right to register at the address they 

ch~se, the student bloc is regarded by 
legIslators with a greater desire for friendship 
than in 1969. Very few legislators would ever 
re-introduce those bills they so readily supported 
when the heat was on. 

A question that was noatin~ around the 
Capitol ~ few year~ ago is again reappearing, 
only thiS lime With a new empbasis. The 
question lhen was, " will the students get what 
they deserve? " Today, lhe question is: " will the

s-xploitation 
by Rev. Greg fletcher 

I am exceedingly dismayed 
by the sickness and perversion 
that prevails in every facet of 
campus life al our university ; 
especially the TRITON 
TIME'S movie advertisements 
for lewd and obscene. 
communisl inspired pervert 
shows that only serve as 
preludes to mass orgies. 
College administrators have 
pussy-footed and codd led the 
depraved offenders for too 
long. Therefore it is my 
re ponsibility 10 respond to 
that heated subject and 
unabashedly give, my 
unshamed opinion of sox. 

the most ignored is the basis of 
our good old -fashioned , 
palriotic moral standards; the 
Holy Word. What the Bible has 
to say about s·x receives very 
little attention, and no wonder 
wi th a grea t flood of s-
xploitalion rising all around us. 

to those who engage in 
unnecessary $oX. An excellent 
example of how a once great 
man brought about his own 
destruction can be found in 
Judges: 13-16. The story relates 
how Samson's descent began 
wilh his uncontrolled lust and 
ended in the infamy of 
Delilah' s lap. True stories such 
as this one emphasize the fact 
that s-xual permissiveness 
invariably makes the strong 
weak and the wise foolish . Do 
not allow the propaganda of 
Comm unist inspired 
contraceptives lure you into an 
act you know is wrong. 0 one 
has invented a " pill" for the 
conscience . Our beloved 
Richard Milhou s Nixon 
expres ed this sentimenl 
perfectly. "American morality 
is nol to be trifled wilh." 

In this day of the 
" Permissive and Perverted 
Society". we hear many voices 
on the bu rning i sue of s-x. 
Howeve r the most 
authoritative and unfortunately

We are drowning in the mire of 
permis iveness that is 
espoused every day in every 
form of media while the 
Church remains mute. What 
makes the situation so pathetic 
is lbat many of our religious 
leaders have succumbed to the 
" New Immorality" and have 
corrupted the Scriptures' " thou 
shalt not" into " thou shalt" . 
Some even glorify illicit sox 
affairs if the relationship is 
meaningful. Absurd! How can 
a lransgression of God 's 
commandments possibly be 
meaningful? Unless of course. 
the violators are Godless 
Homo$oxual Communists. 

In numerous instances the 
Bible warns us of wha t happens

(c..tllMied from paKe 4) 

production inc.reases. if, for 
~xample , productivity 
Increases at two per cent 
yearly and the money supply 
increases as six per cent, the 
result is inflation. 

How does the government 
increase the amount of money 
in circulation? Well , a major 
cause is the national debt. If 
the government in Foggy 
Bottom goes into debt this year 
by, say, 30 billion dollars, then 
it effectively has recei\'ed that 
amount of credit. Instead of 
paying that debt with cash, it 
uses the 30 biUion smacll.eroos 
to buy something else. And 
each time credit is granted, the 
money supply is effectively 
increased. It is as though the 
government had an extra 30 
billion dollars to spend. The 
amount of currency can be 
increased in other wa ys, of 
course, but the point is the 
same: governmental action 
increases the amount of money 
in circulation. And this, in tum, 
forces wages and prices to rise. 

Grab Tllat Vote! 
Why, you ask, does Congress 

allow this? Wby doesn 't 
Congress just cut back on 
appropriations so that there 
would be 110 debt? Because, 
simply, its members would like 
to be returned to office next 
year. And the easiest way to 
get the needed votes is to buy 
them by doling out money for 
this reason or lbat. It is no 
accident that the current 
inrlation has coincided with a 
tremendous increase in 
welfare-type benefits to an 
ever - expanding welfare class. 
So many liberals cri ticize 
Mayor Daley because he, in 
essence, busy votes. But the 
Kennedys and McGoverns and 
Muskies are doing the same 
thing. 

This is not to imply that so 
many of our representatives 
and senators are cynical men 
who are just trying to 
bamboozle the public. Some 
are, sure. But most of them· 
simply display a tremendous 
ignorance of economic theory. 
Too often our elected officials 

believe the silly things that are 
said by " economic wizards" 
like Jolin Kenneth Galbraith. 
(Vou remember Galbraith, the 
prophet who said, las weeks 
ago, that the South Vietnam 
government would not last two 
weeks.) Dr. Galbraith, for 
instance, belie\'es that the 
freeze should be permanent. 
Here he joins !be socialists who 
have always maintained that 
the economy ooght to be 
strictly overseen by 
government. 
. GaibraitIJ's Eceeomic Gaffe 

What the good professor 
either ignores or fails to realize 
is that prolonged freezes 
accentuate abnormalities in the 
economy; they do not allow for 
the shortage of goods or 
materials. What lengthy 
controls produce are severe 
dislocations of the economy's 

The 

superstructure. And, as shown 
by the cnolrols instituted 
during wartime, !bey produce 
lively black markets. 

One can only hope that the 
liberals and socialists will be 
happy thal the freeze bas 
come. Of course they will 
never be really satisfied : after 
all, it was Nixon who initiated 
the controls. (Remember poor 
Alger Hiss and Helen Gahagan 
Douglas?) 
Our best hope, though , is that 

the bulk of Congress will soon 
realize lbat the free.ze cannot 
and will not work and that tile 
best thing to do woold be to 
junk it and start in again with 
traditional economic cures for 
the sick economy. If lbat 
happens, Congress will display 
a collective economic 
intelligence that it has not 
shown for almost four decades.
