MON-FRI 10 A.M. - MIDNIGHT

Some of the best tasting food on

every weekday, 5-7 p.m. Trendy, IKEA-

You have to use real money.

UCSD’s newest dining hall, 
and the only one with an 
all-vegetarian, practically 
all-vegan menu. The food is 
delicious and relatively cheap 
(try the $3 sweet potato fries), 
and the atmosphere is laid-
back and quiet.

Small portions and early 
closing times. Also closed on 
weekends. 

MON-FRI 7 A.M. - 1 A.M. / SAT-SUN 9 A.M. - 1 A.M.

DINING DOLLARS & TRITON CASH

Good place to grab a snack, coffee or the best milkshake 
dining dollars can buy. Comfy couches, a large Tv and a 
pool table. 

Student-run typically means headache-inducing techno 
music blasting all evening long.

Dirt-cheap pub food

music. 

Strict none-under-21 policy

Though any UCSD student will likely argue that his or her college’s 
dining hall is the worst, Sixth College’s remote Foodworx is reliably 
good. It offers surprisingly good made-to-order sandwiches and 
wraps, solid personal pizzas and basically nothing else. 

Cramped interior and no indoor seating.

Need a silent, focused atmosphere in order to pump out that 
final paper? Though it is indeed a precious resource, don’t go 
to Geisel Library to study — during midterms and finals, the first 
floor is hot, loud and absolutely packed, and the quieter upper 
levels are usually just as cramped. Instead, cross the proverbial 
tracks and head to the medical school’s Biomed Library. Even 
when it’s crammed with caffeine-wired grad students, you can still 
hear a pin drop (and yourself think). Ah, sweet silence at last.

Due to massive state budget cuts, UCSD students have suffered the 
loss of four valued libraries (and subsequent study spots) in the last 
few years. Luckily, we still have decent weather and a huge campus 
loaded with all sorts of DIY work stations for those studious shut-ins 
clinging to sanity. Finish that essay at the glider port picnic tables. 
pack a lunch and stake out a spot on the lawns near Sun God. Hit 
the Old Student Center for laid-back vibes, or grab a shady table 
in the price Center plaza. Campus is your nerdy, sleep-deprived 
oyster. Have at it.

To some, Porter’s is the poor man’s Loft. 
To others, it’s the epitome of college 

weekends. The Pub is loud, friendly and bursting at the seams 
with booze and conversation. In addition to the occasional 
indie or electronic artist, the Pub typically features surprisingly 
high-profile hip-hop and rap acts (hence the steeper price). It’s 
also much more popular with San Diego’s general public — a 
great place to rage and mingle with some intoxicated non-
UCSD folk. Sadly, many shows are strictly 21 and up.

At night, price Center’s Zanzibar Cafe turns into one of the 
more clean, trendy and high-budget venues on campus. 
The Loft’s interior is roomy and ultra-modern, and there’s 
a well-stocked bar in the back. Lately the Loft has booked 
mostly electronic and singer-songwriter acts, as well as film 
screenings, comedy shows, a recurring open-mic night and 
a number of other various performances.

For punk and do-it-

historic Che Cafe is the 
real shit. Doubling as a 
vegan co-op and platform 
for radical politics, 
the Che is a source of 
musical pride at UCSD 
— providing cheap, 
all-ages shows by local 
and underground artists 
since 1980. The venue is 
small, hand-painted and 
home to some of the best 
and most transgressive 
live performances in San

Though UCSD’s art community tends to revolve around 
Mandeville Center, those looking for a more intimate 

experience should check out the vAF. The facility offers several 
performance and gallery spaces, as well as private studios for 
graduate students. Whether you’ve come to see an exhibition 
or a traveling artist dialogue, the vAF is great spot to socialize 

with some of contemporary art’s movers and shakers.

While many students will only set foot in the UAG if their G.E. 
art classes are offering extra credit for doing so, those who 
live and breathe art will appreciate the fine gallery UCSD 
has conveniently stuck on the end of Mandeville Center. 
The UAG was founded in 1966 and has since honed in on 
modern art, with a specific focus on the international and the 
interdisciplinary.

No, your eyes do not deceive you. There is indeed 
a quaint blue cottage perched precariously atop the 

Jacob’s School of Engineering Building. You can even 
take the elevator to the top floor and step inside for a 

gravity-defying visit. This piece, entitled “Fallen Star” by 
artist Do-Ho Suh, is part of UCSD’s signature Stuart Art 

Collection. Though often a target for student negativity, 
the collection exhibits work from some of contemporary 

art’s most important figures — from Bruce Nauman to 
John Baldessari — giving campus a unique ambiance fit 

for its forward-thinking identity.

In the shadows of UCSD’s science and research claim-to-fame 
lies one of the nation’s leading theater programs, as well as the 
world-famous La Jolla playhouse (where many Broadway hits found 
their humble beginnings). In the center of the theater district, 
hidden in some postmodern architectural cube, is Wolfgang puck’s 
delicious Jai restaurant. If you aren’t rolling in cash, however, take 
a stroll around the playhouse to William Wegman’s La Jolla vista 
view lookout point. Hang a right and see if you can find the secret 
garden hidden behind the theater set store room.

HARE KRISHNA (WED. )

Despite the glaring fact that we have a giant eucalyptus 
grove blanketing the entire northeastern corner of our 
campus, many students will never even set foot on the 

beautiful miles of walking/mountain biking trails that wind 
in and around the so-called RIMAC Woods. But if you’re in 
the mood for a relaxing nature stroll, a challenging athletic 

course or some midnight star gazing, no other place on 
campus even comes close.

The Old Student Center is probably most known for being one 
of the only spots at UCSD that actually resembles a college 
campus. There’s a pub, a dirt-cheap general store (the best place 
on campus to buy testing materials and much more), a record 

store, a food co-op, a 
book co-op, the KSDT 
radio station and the 
Guardian newspaper 
offices, all in one cozy 
little quad. If you’re 
looking for a place to 
procrastinate, the
Old Student Center
is that place.

I F  you aren’t up for an exhaustingly 

long bus ride, there’s enough just 

down the hill in luxurious downtown 

La Jolla to keep you occupied for an 

afternoon, or even a few hours between 

classes. While the city’s opulence 

may be slightly inconvenient for the 

average student on a budget, it does 

provide some spectacular sights — 

many free of charge. The M U S E U M 

O F  C O N T E M P O R A R Y  A R T  rarely 

disappoints, with an ever-rotating 

collection of renowned art from modern 

artists both local and worldwide (free 

for students 25 and under). Among 

the city’s luxury clothing outlets are 

some relatively cheap eats — from 

S M A S H  B U R G E R  and the delicious 

D O N  C A R L O S  to the quaint and 

popular L I V I N G  R O O M  and PA N N I K I N  cof fee shops. For 

a breathtaking sunset, walk down B L AC K ’ S  B E AC H , one of 

the country’s largest nude beaches, and head up the clif fs 

to the G L I D E R  P O R T  — a remarkable secret (not so secret 

on weekends) study and relaxation spot that’s just a breezy 

five-minute walk from campus.

W E L C O M E  to your new home. While the 

area directly surrounding campus hasn’t 

much in the way of nightlife, it does offer 

practically all of your basic amenities within 

walking distance from campus — a relief for 

students unwilling to participate in UCSD’s 

notoriously heinous parking system. The 

nearby L A  J O L L A  V I L L AG E  S q UA R E 

boasts two grocery stores (R A L P H S 

and T R A D E R  J O E ’ S ), a B E S T  B U Y, a 

S TA P L E S , an A M C  M OV I E  T H E AT R E 

and a number of cheap food alternatives 

including C H I P O T L E , P I C K  U P  S T I X , 

DA P H N E ’ S  G R E E K  C A F E , C A L I F O R N I A 

P I z z A  K I T C H E N  and S TA R B U C K S . 

Further inland is the U T C  M A L L , home 

of I C E  T O W N  ice skating rink, a farmer’s 

market every Thursday and a  host of 

other various shops and restaurants. Is 

your veganism making it difficult to find good food? Head to 

Clairemont for S P R O U T ’ S  organic groceries or the delicious 

S I P z  F U S I O N  V E G E TA R I A N  C A F E  on Clairemont Mesa 

Boulevard. (free mango tea if you pay with cash). And for those 

on a quest for the perfect carne asada fries, search no further 

than L O L I TA’ S  — also on Clairemont Mesa.

L A  J O L L A  doesn’t look 

much like a college town, and 

that’s because it isn’t. Those 

searching for late-night food, 

cheap clothes and a bout of

further south. pacific Beach is 

a charmingly grungy shopping 

and bar district home to many 

third- and fourth-year UCSD 

students. Most of the city’s 

drunken debauchery takes place 

on Garnet Street — there’s 

C A B O  C A N T I N A  (cheap), the 

TA P  R O O M  (sports), the R E D 

V E LV E T  L O U N G E  (hookah) and 

at least a dozen other decent pit 

stops for an intoxicated Saturday 

night. Conveniently, pB also has 

some of this city’s great eateries 

as well, from W O R L D  C U R R Y

If you seek a colorful escape, head 

southeast to H I L L C R E S T  and 

N O R T H  PA R K  — the two adjacent 

neighborhoods that comprise 

San Diego’s LGBT-friendly fashion 

district and its up-and-coming 

arts district respectively. 



PAC I F I C  Beach’s thrift stores out of passable styles? It’s time to 

take the extra trek to Hillcrest’s popular 5th Avenue. In addition 

to a plethora of excellent restaurants (breakfast at the S N O Oz E 

A M  E AT E R Y  is a must) and arguably the best art-house movie 

theater in San Diego (H I L L C R E S T  L A N D M A R K ), this small strip 

is home to the best of the city’s second and first-hand clothing. 

From the cheap (B U F FA L O  E XC H A N G E  and retro superstore 

F L A S H B AC K S ), to the moderately-priced (U R B A N  O U T F I T T E R S 

and A M E R I C A N  A P PA R E L  around the corner), 5th Avenue has 

got you covered. If your artistic gratification comes in the form 

of dusty vinyl, check out R E C O R D  C I T Y  on 6th and T H I R S T Y 

M O O N  just around the corner.

With its affordable housing and string of respectable galleries 

(check out A R T  P R O D U C E  on University), North park has 

earned the reputation of San Diego’s ragtag arts district. 30th 

street is home to more than a few popular bars and clubs, 

from B A R  P I N K  C O C K TA I L  L O U N G E  to the aptly named A I R 

C O N D I T I O N E D  night club. Recently, if you were under 21 and 

wanted to catch a show, San Diego was cruel and patronizing 

place; now, the I R E N I C  on polk offers cheap and tasteful live 

acts for all ages. And where there is art, there is inevitably 

coffee. Head to FI LT E R  C O F F E E  H O U S E  (open until 3 a.m. 

on Fridays and Saturdays), or make a stop in Normal Heights 

for the fabled 24-hour caffeine haven that is L E S TAT ’ S . Art, 

conversation and comfortable seating abound.

I F  you’re 21, downtown San Diego’s G A S L A M P 

D I S T R I C T  is a boozed jubilee of bars, restaurants, 

clubs and music venues (the C A S B A H  on Kettner is 

a classic). If you’re a minor, however, you’re going to 

have to do a bit more searching. The historic B A L B OA 

PA R K  is one of the best ways to kill a lazy Sunday — 

with 17 great museums (bring your ID for a student 

discount), an organ pavilion, a botanical garden, 

several beautiful picnic-worthy parks and the world-

excessive glory, and the somewhat quieter S E A P O R T 

V I L L AG E  is the perfect place to take a moonlit 

harbor-side stroll before a fancy wine-and-dine with 

a date. If you’re a sports fan, why not catch a padres 

game at P E T C O  PA R K . Tickets are a reasonable 

eight bucks, and public transit drops you off right at 

the stadium gates. Sticking around for summer? Be 

sure to score tickets to the monolithic S A N  D I E G O 

C O M I C - C O N  at the convention center for all the pop 

culture indulgence you could ever possibly hope for, 

crammed into a single fan-filled weekend.
