UCSD's M arshall Rosenbluth 
has been selected as one of nine 
recipients this year 10 be honored 
wilh the National Medal ~f Science 
- the Uniled Stales' equivalent of 
Ihe Nobel Pri7.e. 

Rosenbluth, a professor emeri-
tus and research phys icist , will be 
recognized at a White House cere-
mony laler thi s year for hi ground-
breaking research and contribu-
tions to plasma phy ics, thermonu-
clear fu sion and related problems 
concerning national security. 

The medal , awarded by 
President Bill Clinton. recognizes 
outstanding indi viduals who have 
significantly advanced knowledge 
in the fields of physics. biology, 
mathematics, engineeriqg and soci-
ology and other behavioral sciences. 

" It is important that the nation 
publicly repay its debt to the e out-
standing men and women whose 
contributions to science have 
helped to advance human learning, 
fight disease and prov idc insight 
into the central questions of the 
nature of the uni verse and humani-
ty 's place in it," ~aid cal Lane, 
director of the Nalional Science 
Foundation (NSF). 

The SF administers the medal

Rosenbluth is considered by 
many to be the dean of fusion theo-
rists. Much of the design and devel-
opment of prototype devices for 
fusion power have resulted from 

Since j oining the UCSD faculty 
in 1959. Rosenbluth has received 
numerous awards including the 
E.O. Lawrence Prize, the Albert 
Einstein Award ~nd the Enrico

studies of the 
behavior of plas-
mas and thei r 
instabilities. 

At the age of 
22. hi s analysis 
of t he scalleri ng 
of relativistic 
electrons within 
nuclei led to the 
discovery of the

National Tax Break Needed 
To Help Pay for College 

Because people lacking a si gnifi cant level of educa-
tion beyond high school are nowadays likely to have suc-
cess elude them , it is underst andable thaI lhe skyrocket-
ing cost of a typical college education has caused a great 
deal of consternation among famili es who worry that 
their childrt:n wi ll bc dt:nied access to the Ameri can 
Dream. 

Two a li fornia politicians have pi cked up on voter 
worries about college costs, and have come up with plans 
to add ress the problem. Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, 
R-Los Olivos, und Senator Tom Hayden , D-Los Angeles, 
huve in troduced competing plans aimed al helping peo-
ple save money for their children\ col lege educations. 

Of the two plans. Firestone's hill (A.B. 13) looks more 
feasible : It would create a state-wide investment vehicle 
to which parents could con tribute on a pay-as-you-can, 
state-lax-free hasis. The theory is that the large amounts 
of capital the fund would attract would provide a greater 
return for less ri sk than could be attai ned by the average 
individual investor. 

In reality however, most investors can di versify 
investments sufficientl y via indexed mutual funds . 
Firestone's plan would merely put the onus of picking 
good investments on the government instead of individu-
als. Bes ides not havi ng the greatest record for pi cking 
good investments (recall Orange County's massive 
investment-pool losses a few years ago), politicians 
would be tempted to dip into the funds for other purpos-
es, leav ing large stacks of worthless IOU 's in the till -
us has become the case with Social Security. 

Hayden's plan (S .B. 101 ) is far worse because it guar-
antees an unknown future return upon a set initial invest-
ment. Under S.B. 101 , a person would invest an amount 
equal to the current cost of a year's tuition and fees at 
California's public universities, and wou ld be guaranteed 
a return equal to a year's tuition and fees at some year in 
the future. Hayden's plan has all the drawbacks of 
Firestone's, plus several more. Hayden's plan would pro-
vide schools with an excuse to raise fees through the roof 
knowing that the government would cover the cost. This 
would effectively make taxpayers liable for tuition 
increases, amounting to a stealthy tax increase. 

What really needs to be done to help individuals fund 
their chi ldren's college educations must be enacted on 
the national level. Just as Individual Retirement 
Accounts (lRAs) were introduced to help people fund 
their own retirements by investing a certain tax -deferred 
amount per year, a similar vehicle should be introduced 
for parents to invest in their chi ldren's' educations. 

Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) would be based 
on the IRA model. Parents cou ld invest a certain, c{pped 
amount per year on a tax-free basis, and the money 

I would remain tax-free as long as it was used to cover 
education-related expenses. Such a vehicle would 
encourage parents to take responsibility for their chi l-
dren's educations, while at the same time helping with I college costs through tax breaks. 

If government truly wants to make col lege more 
affordable. it should let people keep more of what they 
earn by introducing tax-free ESAs. 

Thumbs Up to UCSO's heightened 
reputation among college applicants 

Students admitted to UCSD for next year have surprised 
administrators by enrolling in higher-than-expected 
numbers. Make no mistake. UCSD is a "hot" commodity.

For all the ink spilled these

why we need it and how you can 
use it to make your life Ihat much

Lesson. frHl • BlKk

I read an academic paper a few 
years ago on the topic of genetic 
engineering that starkly illustrated 
the power of diversi lY . 
Researchers in Egypt (or wa it 
Israel') I can never remember ... ) 
successfully cultivated what Ihey 
thought was the perfect wheat 
planl ; it wa.s hardy, nutrilious and 
bred to be resistant to every form 
of local pestilence the bOlani sts 
could think or. Flushed wilh viclo-
ry. they proceeded 10 clone the 
wheal and plant it on Ihe research 
lab's farms. 

The results were spectacular -
the local farmers enj oyed bounti-
ful harvests with a minimal use of 
pesticides for two years . In the 
Ihird year, a wheal fungus that

Consider the inordinate amount 
of energy (that could have been 
avoided with asexua l reproduc-

We are part of a system in 
which we carry our unique signa-
lure and are allowed only to pass, 
with great effort, a partial genelic 
fingerprint to the next generation 
before we die. Why spend thi s 
energy and go through the process 
of constant change attendant to a 
system of sexual reproduction '! 
Only to avoid the pitfalls of genel -

And so. with this messy. sto-

COMMENTARY: National education standards would improve the quality of poor, inner-city schools, 
foster clear and independent thinking and encourage the intellectual freedom of educators and their pupils 

STANDARDS WILL HELP UeSe MAKE THE GRADE 
By Simone 5MtInI 
Contributing Opinion !Miter 

America is currently in the midst 
of an intense debate over the need for 
a nalional educalion slandard. Gi ven 
Ihe lalUS of high school education in 
America. this dehme comes none 100 
soon. 

A nalional education standard is 
desperalely needed. Among Ihe lcast-
cited, and most relevanl. reasons are 
the increasingly harsh economic 
lands(;ape fa<.:ed by unskilled workers 
and the gap bel ween Ihe qualilY of 
high school and college education in 
the Uniled States. 

Far from relying exclusively on 
merit. college admission is biased in 
several ways. The most statistically 
significant bias relates to the et:o-
nomic slatus of applicants. Even 
though Proposi lion 209 outlawed 
race- and gender-based affirmative-
aClion programs. that soughl to help 
members of underrepresenled 
minorilies, it is sti II perfectly legal for 
someone 10 be admitted in place of a 
more qualified <.:andidale on ly 
because he can afford to pay. 

True equality requires that college 
attendance be free for everyone (by 
awarding fellowships. for instance), 
and Ihal the rigorous seleclion 

process for admis ion be based sole-
lyon academic potential. These poli -
cies, however, are <.:ertainly very far 
from implemenlalion. 

Esca lating fees and the SUhSlilu-
lion of merit-based fellowships wilh 
n ed-based loans increase the eco-
nomic hia~ . These trends are unfortu-
nale, bUI are not likely to change any 
lime soon. 

In the ncar fu ture, at least, tradi -
lionally disadvanlaged social groups 
will increasingly rely on high school 
to provide educalion to last a life-
lime. High schools are terribly inade-
quale for th is lask, especially those 
located in inner cilies and other poor 
areas. In other words, the people who 
are least likely 10 go to college are 
also those who re<.:eive the worst high 
school educalion. What a tragedy. 

A national standard would help 
alleviate this problem by ensuring 
thai cveryone graduates from high 
school with a guaranteed minimal 
level of educalion. This will give 
people who will not attend college 
some <.:hance to fi nd good jobs. 
Currently. leaving school before col-
lege more or less guaraniees a life-
time in the lower portion of the 
income curve.

America is quile unique; No other 
induslriali zed counlry in the world 
has such a greal gap hctween Ihe 

quality of the jobs one can find wilh 
a high school diploma and those onc 
ean find with a college degree. 

In men countries, a high school 
diploma is enough to becollle a certi-
fied puhlic accountan l or a qua lilied 
lechnician. A high school educalion 
in olher counlries also ensures a 
decent cultural education. When I 
gradualed from high school in haly 
(after taking a nationally standard-
iled fi nal exam that caused me nighl-
mares for months). I had a cultuml 
and lechnical background that, COI11 -
pared to what I see in UCSD fresh-
men. could be considered outstand-
ing. Furthennore, the education I 
received in Italy would have allowed 
me 10 fi nd a reasonahly well-paid 
job. 

In Ihe U.S .. a high school diploma 
is basically useless for all but lhe 
most menial jobs. Widening the gap 
between high school and college will 
exa<.:erbale the difference belween 
the atlluenl minorilY and Ihe poor 
majority. One of the greatesl prides 
of American socielY ha, always been 
a relatively high social mohililY. The 
widening educalion gap in society 
and Ihe demand for more and more 
ski lled lahor cou ld make Ihis pride a 
thing of Ihe past. 

A generi (.: commitmenl of local 
school hoards 10 improve the qualilY 
of education is not enough. Some 
school districts don ' t have the finan-
cial resources to implemenl serious 
rctimn. or are immersed in a social 
climale 100 <.:onscrvali ve or disillu-
sioned to take any construcli e 
arlinn. The cnfor<.:el1lenl of a nation-
al siandard would mean Ihal the 
resources necessary 10 improve edu-
cation in disadvanlaged areas would 
be distribuled allhe national level. 

In addilion 10 placing everyhody 
in a fair posilion 10 compele for <.:01-
kge admissions and good johs, a 
nalional standard would mark a sub-
tle, bUI importanl. a(.:knowledgllleni 
of Ihe glohal dmr.l<.:ter of our <.:ultural 
and economic life. 

Local standards made perfect 
sense in a society where most people 
spent their enlire lives wilhin Ihe 
same communily. Wilh Ihe advent of 
frequenl travel. mass communication 
lind Ihe Internet, the idea of "commu-
nily" is bc<.:oming increasingly inde-
pendent of its gcognlphic origins. A 
national standard Ihat recognizes Ihal 
we are ci ti zens of the world would be 
a partial acknowledgement of Ihe 
change thai is oc<.:urring.

The royal road to the Nobel 
Prize and lucrative grants is paved 
with scientific reductionism; we 
richly reward researchers who can 
reduce and quantify the mallest 
measurable scientific phenomenon. 
The conventional wisdom is that if 
you understand the hows and whys 
of the smallest building blocks 
(whether they be biological , chem-
ical or physical), you can build 
right hack up from them a coherent 
model of anything you want. 

While there is much that we 
can learn from reductionism, 
recent advances in chaos mathe-
matics and dynami c modeling 
have done much to demonstrate 
the value of a broader per pecti ve.

less frce in the Netherlands (a coun-

Mississippi . Most of this concern is

By tackling topies of interest 
that no ingle discipline can ade-
quately answer, they provide the 
rich and fertile ground that modem 
collegiate academia have left fal-
low. 

Researchers (a majority of 
whom are Ph.D.s in the natural, 
engi neering and socia l sciences) 
bring the tools and models learned 
in their field and collaborate to 
tackle problems beyond the scope 
of any single discipline - particu-
larly problems in the emerging sci-
ence of complex adaptive ystems. 

By attracting researchers who 
arc eager to interact with people 
from other fields, and willing to 
go beyond the boundaries of acad-
emic disciplines or ideology, SFI 
reflects the intellectual diversity 
that the natural and social sciences 
desperately need as they begin to 
exhaust the limits of the currently 
segregated fields of specialization.

I've offered this advice before,

then ab orb reams of books, lec-

become terribly precious. We need a

CHANDLER: 
Appointment subject 
to regents' approval 
ContInued from PICe 1 
her interests are multidisciplinary. 

One of Chandler 's interests is 
undergraduate education. She was 
a visiting professor at Harvard 
University 's Center for 
International Affairs in 1995-96, 
when she studied the domestic 
implications of how nations adjust 
to changing patterns of trade. 

" It was one of the most fun 
things that [' ve done in a long 
ti me," she said. " It was an i nterest -
ing way to sort of really get much 
more of a ense of student perspec-
tives on a lot of things." 

Chandler said she lived in the 

GRADUATE: 
Proposal advances 
to Academic Senate 
Continued from Pille 1 
teach writing workshops. However, 
the M.A. incorporates literary theory 
and a critical study of literature with 
its creative writing core. [n other 
words, it 's a more valuable degree for 
a writer and much more applicable in 
college teaching." 

The M.A. will also broaden 
graduate-study options for UCSD 
writing students. 

Michelle Hou le, a Muir senior 
and IiteralUre/writing major, said 
that even though most Ml:A stu-
dents at San Francisco State 
University ge t their creative theses 
- full - length novels - published. 
UCSO's M.A. program will pro-
vide a valuable option to graduat-
i ng wri ting students. 

" It 's awful to think you have to 
go to San Franci~co State to contin -
ue a wri ting study." Houle ~aid . 
Vcrdicchio added that an M.A. pro-
gram will providl! cum:nt under-
graduate literature/writing stlldent~ 
wi th the opportu nity to continue 
their studies at C O. 

"[The wri t i ng program J ha, lo,t 
Illany good student, to the MFA 
program at San Franci,co State: ' 
Verdicchio said. "The UCSO pro-
gram will provide an incentive for 
students to stay and continue ~tudy ­
ing with profes,or, from thei r 
undergraduate studies." 

Jesse Cunningham, a Muir. 
senior and literature/writing major, 
said a graduate program would 
help cement professor-student rela-
tionships . 

" In the quarter ~ystcm hcre, you 
need to take a professor a few times 
before you can establish a relation-
ship." Cunningham said . "And I 
support a teacher-student relation-
ship. which is essential for creative 
wri ting. By the time you start grad-
uate work , it will be encouraging to 
already ha ve that relationship 
establi hed ." 

In addi ti on. Verdicchio said the 
proposed graduate program wou Id 
unify writing faculty rather than 
dispersing them among other di~ci ­
plines in the literature department. 

.. It will give thc writing center 
more coherence," Verdicchio sa id . 
"We are a little bit dispersed since 
we teach on many fronts." 

If approved by the Office of 
Graduate Studies and Research, the 
Academic Senate's Graduate 
Cou nci l will review the proposal 
and forward it to the proper author-
ities for final approval. 

Verdicchio said he hopes the 
program can enroll its fir t students 
in fall 199 

"Harvard Houses," which are the 
Harvard dormitories. 

"Essentially, I was living among 
the undergraduates last year," she 
said. HI had a great time." 

Chandler was born in Virginia 
in 1945. She went to high school in 
New York City and earned her 
bachelor's degree at the College of 
the City of New York. 

She received a Ph.D. from the 
University of North Carolina and 
Chapel Hill, where she met her 
future husband. 

"We met in graduate school, in a 
scope and methods clas ," she aid. 
They were married in 1968. 

William Chandler will be join-
ing UCSO's department of political 
science as a senior lecturer with 
security of employment. William 
Chandler is currently chair of the

McMaster University political ci-
ence department, specializing in 
comparative politics. 

The University of Toronto was 

founded in 1827 as King's College, 
the first university in Canada. It 
enrolls more than 50,000 students 
and is the nation's largest universi-
ty. It is also the fifth-largest univer-
sity in North America. 

Chandler 's salary at the 
University of Toronto was 
$130.483.95 per year. Her UCSD 
appointment and salary, which wa 
unavailable at press time, will be 
voted on Friday by the UC Board 
of Regents . 

Richard Alliyeh, UCSD's inter-
im vice chancellor for academic 
affairs, said yesterday that he plan 
to return to his old job as vice chan-
cellor for research/dean of graduate 
tudies. 

Attiyeh was appointed to the

Dynes, who previously held the 
position, was promoted. David 
Sworder, the acting vice chancel-
lor for research, will return to the 
associate vice chancellor position 
he held before Alliyeh's appoint-
ment. 

Dynes was originally appointed 
vice chancellor of academic affairs 
in May 1995 when Marjorie 
Caserio was named interim chan-
cellor. He joined the faculty in 
1991 after 22 years at AT&T Bell 
Labs. 

Chandler noted that while she 
jogs on occasion, she would be 
hard-pressed to keep up with 
Dynes and hi s early-morning 
marathons. 

"I more prefer fast walking," 
she said. "To be honest, [ have a 
Stairmaster which I adore."

ELECTION: 
Alvarez denies

Continued from page 1 

Al va rez's propo cd amend-
mcnts would limit voting solely to 
undergraduate students "who can 
prescnt [their] current J.D. verify-
ing enroll ment in the current quar-
ter." 

On April 16, the day of the run-
off election, Students First! presi-
denlial candidate Alex T. Tom 
fi led an e lection-v iolations report 
form claim ing that students were 
turned away from the polls if they 
did not ha ve the current quarter's 
registrati on sti cker. Tom asked 
that the enlire elec li on be in vali -
dated. 

Tom said he beli eves many stu-
denis tri ed tp vote but were denied 
ball ots because t hey lacked the 
spring sti cker. 

"A lot of peoplc were turned 
away automatically," he said . 
"People who wanted 10 vote asked 
and were turned away." 

Tom said many students rece iv-
ing financial aid were unable 10 
vote because they did not receive 
thei r quarterl y di sbursements in 
time to obtain the Slicker. 

"Fi nancial -aid checks didn ' t 
come in on time, theref re a lot of 
people didn 't vote," he said. 

According to Jason Thornton of 
the Student Resea rch and 

Information office, approxi mately 
62 pe rcent of UCS D's 14,623 
undergraduate students recei ve 
some so rt of fi nancia l aid . . 

Tom said he belicves thc extra

tion results. 

" It would have really changed

"That 's probab ly what the

them. 

" We never rejected anyone," 
Al varez said. " It 's requi red that

However, Alvare7 said that

Alvarez said he told Tom he

Tom said he was never informed of

"He didn' t say that," Tom said. 
" If he did, I would have done it."

Boston Celtics for the next 
10 yea rs, as we ll as Larry Bird 's 
recent contrac t wi th the Indi ana Pac-
ers (worth a report ed $4 .5 mi llion-

making something compara ble to 
his players. In fact, Pitino is making 
$ 1.7 mill ion more a year than Dino 
Radj a, the Ce lt ics hig hest-paid

One can argue, "Why should a 
coach make what hi s players make? 
Aft er all, a player is the one who has 

to defeat Oli ver in the next two. 7-

Them, themselves and us: De La Soul is (from left) Maseo, Posdnuos and Trugoy the Dove.

Posdnuos (Kelvin Mercer), Trugoy 
the Dove (David Joli couer) and Maseo 
(Vincent Mason) - al~o known as 
Plugs I. 2 and 3, respective ly - com-
pme the amal.i ng hip-hop trio of Dc La 
Soul. Their fi r~t alhum , Three FeN fl il(h 
and Risin/:. includes the off-beat usc of 
sample., ranging from Johnny Cash to a 
French in ~ tructional record . Co-pro-
duced hy De La Soul and Prince Paul of 

ew York ' ~ Stetsa~oni c, the alhum 
became an in\ tant hit with the hip-hop 
world. The tno hal, ' lnce relea!>cd three 
more album" and i, currently wrapping 
up its nationwide tour. 

The Guardian caught up with Po,d-
nuo, in ew York, where he wa~ work-
ing on pre-production for De La Soul's 
new alhum. 
Guardian: Whatever happened 
to the "De La Haircut?" 

Po dnuos: It 's outta there, bro. 
You guys quickly became popu-
lar after your first single, "Me, 
MyseH, and I," became a radio 
staple. How do you think 
becoming popular so quickly 
affected you as a group? 

I must say it didn't affect us in [I neg-
ative way. It rea lly just showed the test 
of time between ourselves. I' m really 
happy to ~ay that we were never ones to 
believe in the hype, because we even 
knew from back then that thi s respect 
that we were gelling from people could 
be gone tomorrow. It reall y pu! faith and 
trust in the people who truly love you. 
We're happy that we're sti ll around, that 
people know who we arc and that peo-
ple respect who we arc. 
Some consider De La Soul, 

along with the Jungle Brothers 
and A Tribe Called Quest, to be 
the originators of a unique, 
almost jazzy style of hip-hop, 
opening the door for artists like-
Digable Planets or The Roots to 
try a more organic flow. 

If anyhody de~erve~ cn:dit jau-wisc 
it wou ld he Trihe. Even myself - I was-
n' t rea ll y into even looking through jail 
or even payi ng attention to it until I got 
down with IQ-tip of A Trihe Called 
Que,q . With u~ , for De La Soul's Inmd-

~ tate . it wa\ jw,t noise~. period. It didn ' t 
matter If it W<l\ jail. (ountry or whatev-
er. Our motto wa~ to tak.: anything and 

Ina~c musIc out of it. It wasn't that we 
weren' t payi ng attention to Le~ McCaan 
ur Lou Donald~on , it wa, Ju~t like, "Yo, 
I picked up this record out of the store. I 
don 't know what 's on it , let me hear 
somcthing, let \ try to makc it work." I 
think that's what made Tll ree Feel /Ii!:11 
and I<I.I"il1/: so spec ial. We just took any-
thing and tri ed to make it wurk , whether 
it wa, Johnny Cash or whoever. 
On your curre f tour you chose 
Jeru the Damaja and DJ Shadow 
as co-headliners. With their 
individual styles being practical-
ly polar opposites, does this 
reflect your varying tastes? 

We respect both individual people. It 
wasn't like I said. "Let's make sure 
[that] musically we can have these dif-
ferent sections being shown." At the prc-
sent time, wi th these brothers having 
new albums out, we said, "Why not'!" 
We've respected what Jcru has done, and 
I' ve heard about [DJ] Shadow for a 
while, It was t:Ool that we got a chance to 
run into each other' s paths and perform.

we should have a name that year~

from the soul. So I ~aid to my other

the event has been moved to thi .,

when all students can come together 
to eel ' bmtc in un ison and, generally 
s[lCaking, have a good time. HaVing a 
good tlille, however, al 0 means 
being responsible. We at ASUCSD 
encourage all a ttendee~ to exerci ~e 

re~pon s ibili ty before, du ri ng and 
after the event. 

Historically. there have been a 
large number of Palti es on the day of 
the fcs ti val. TIle e panics resu lt in a 
sig lll ticant number of i nt ox leated 
individuals disnl pting the fes ti vi ties 
and creating problems for secunty 
and campus police. Agai n, we 
encourage everyone to exerc i~e 
responsibility in their partying. 
Please leave all alcohol behind 
before arriving at the conccn. 

All paJticipants will be asked to 
show proper identification upon enliY,

We at ASUCSD understand the!>!! 
mea~ure~ may seem exeessive. How-
ever, they arc necessary to ensure the 

~uccc~s of the festival. We thank you 
for your under.,tanding. With your

exactly what il lakes to be a pro-

I had a midterm alii a.m. the
