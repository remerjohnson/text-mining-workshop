Student orgs replace 
finance committee in 
control of A.S. funds 
M embers of SOFAB will now get a 
vote in how money is dispersed 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

In an effort to give student 
organizations more say in the dis-
bursement of A.S. funds, the 
Student Organizations Funding 
Advisory Board will no longer be 
under the direct control of the A.S. 
Finance Committee. Instead, it wi ll 
consist of voting members repre-
senting the student organizations 
themselves. 

The board wi ll now be made 
up of representatives from student 
organizations grouped into nine 
categories: 
Academic/Educational, Political, 
GreeklInterfraternity 
Council/Panhellenic, 
Cultural/Student Affirmative 
Action Committee, Religious, 
Pre - professio nal/Health profes-
ions, ocial, Recreation and 

Service. 
Funding for student organiza-

tions was formerly determined 
solely by the A.S. Finance 
Committee, which is comprised of 
A.S. vice president of finance and 
senators appointed to that commit-
tee. 

Under the new SOFAH system, 
two A.S. Council senators, one 
from the Finance Committee and 
one from the Internal Committee, 
will act as nonvoting co-chairs. 

The item, written and submit-
ted by A.S. President Jeff Dodge, 
A.S. Vice President of Finance Sam 
Shooshtary, Thurgood Marshall 
College Sophomore Senator Sierra 
Catcott and Earl Warren College 
Sophomore Senator Kevin Hsu,

meeting Jan. 23.

organizational structure next

Bookstore may soon carry 
every required textbook 
Watson cites 
convenIence 
in proposal 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The long lines of students 
waiting to buy textbooks at 
Groundwork Books may shorten 
next quarter, but the wa Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
J oseph Watson plans to reduce the 
wait may anger some 
Groundwork customers. 

Watson is working on a pro-
posal to mandate that all 
required textbooks be listed and 
sold at the UCSD Bookstore in 
the Price Center. This idea irks 
many who patronize 
Groundwork, a student- run 
cooperative. 

Lyon llew/Guordian 
Open book: Although its shelves are bare now, a proposal that is in the works 
would require textbooks for all UCSD classes be avaible at the university bookstore. 

Watson and the Office of 
Student Affairs have sent a letter 
to Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Mark Applebaum propos-
ing the change. 

Watson cites confusion on 
where to buy class textbooks as 
the driving force behind the idea. 

The plan is not finalized, but 
Watson has made p'<Iblic that he 
wants to make it easier for stu-
dents to know where to buy 
books. 

"From time to time, students 
will express concerns that they are 
not given an awareness of where 
the books are," Watson said. 
"What I suggest is to have all 
books listed at the Bookstore and 
also sold at UC bookstore." 

Some co-op patrons and sym-
pathizers oppose Watson 's plan, as 

do those who shop at other stu-
dent-run bookstores. 

Muir junior Chris Juvinal 
thinks the proposed plan will hurt 
Groundwork Books. 

"Selling all books at the uni -
versity bookstore would take away 
business from Groundwork Books 
and also awareness that there is an 
alternative bookstore on campus," 
Juvinal said.

Che Cafe workers and patrons 
are coordinating an ongoing 
protest against Physical Plant 
Services' plan to build a 30-foot-
long storage shed behind the cafe. 

This shed would replace severa] 
smaller storage containers in the 
same area . Protestors say the new 
shed will decrease parking around 
the cafe, increase traffic to the area 
and block access to the organic gar-
den behind the cafe. 

The space where the storage 
shed will be located is now covered 
by a large pile of branches, mat-
tresses, broken boards and yellow

SOFAS: 
AS Council still to have final 
say over allocation of funds 
Continued from page 1

SOFAB is done currently," 1-lsu said . 
",\ lore than anything, :1 lot of members 
of ,tudCIH organizations had issues with 
the ",.II' it's d'One now." 

In'response to concerns raised hy 
SOF,\H members and student organi -
Z.1l 10nS, Shooshtary's office 

rc~carched tl1e systems other colleges 
u,,, to allocate finances ro student 
organizations. Several colleges, they 
found, usc a system similar ro the one 
recently devised by the A.S. Council , 
and found they worked well for them, 
according to Shooshtary. 

"We're hoping that it will give 
morc responsibility to the student 
organi za ti ons," Shooshtary said. "It 
will be a lot easier for the senators [on 
the Finance Committee), and [the 
funding) still goes through the 
Finance Committee and me A.S. 
Council, so we have the checks and 
balances." 

Hsu agrees wim Shooshtary. 
"1 think the system we've devised 

is good in terms of checks and bal-
ances, and the representatives for the 
student organizations will find it in 
their best interest to distribute funds 
fairly," Hsu said. 

T he desire to change SOFi\B was 
not shared by all members of the A.S. 
Council. 

Thu rgood Marsha ll College 
Junior Senator William Tunick, who 
abstained from voting- on me item, 
said that me SOFAB reform is being 
II ed as a vehicle for increased interac-
tion between the two groups, and that 
it might not be me best decision. 

"There's obviously a large gap 
communication wise between A.S. and 
me student organizations, but 1 think 
that there might be more productive 
ways of fixing that," Twuck said. 

T he new rules governing SOFAB 
do not necessarily give power to the 
student organizations, unlike how the 
new system appears on the surface, 
Tunick said. 

"r felt mat this was a way for A.S. to 
give some of me grunt work to tl1e stu-
dent organizations," Tunick said. "In 
the end, it's still up to A.S. to make me 
final decision as to me allocations." 

However, Tunick does not 
believe th:tt the current SOFAB sys-
tem is necessa rily better than the 
new one. 

The SOFAB reform will allow for 
!,'Tcater communication between the 
student organizations and the council, 
according to Hsu. 

"We hope that by reforming the 
SOFAB structure, it will allow a bet-
ter and more fair allocation of money 
and greater interaction between stu-
uent organizations and A.S.," Hsu 
sa id.

filmed this summer at various locations in 
Europe. 

The creN is looking for people aged 18 to 25 
who live or go to school in the greater San Di~o 
area . The producers of the film are looking speCifi-
cally for those without commercial or on-camera 
experience. The casting (feN would also prefer peo-
ple who have never left the country, according to 
casting diredor Matthew Seemann. 

Those who wish to audition are instruded to 
show up at PB Bar & Grill with a bag packed with 
clothing, accessories and travel items that you 
would likely bring with you if seleded for the film . 
Potential cast members may also have to answer 
several brief personal and travel-related questions. 
The interviews should last somewhere between five 
and 10 minutes. 

Currently, only eight members of the 31-person 
cast have been seleded. The finalists and standbys 
will be notified by next week.

UCLA survey finds freshmen 
more politically liberal 

More college freshmen are identifying them-
selves as politically liberal than they have in the past, 
according to UCLA's annual survey of the nation's 
entering undergraduate classes. 

The survey, conduded last fall by the Higher 
Education Research Institute at UCLA's Graduate 
School of Education and Information Studies, 
found that 29.9 percent of students entering 
four-year colleges and universities characterize 
their political views as 'liberal" or "far left." The 
number was substantially higher than the 20.7 
percent who co nsider themselves 'conservative" 
or "far right" 

The number was also an increase over last year's 
number of 27.7 percent of students who considered 
themselves "liberal" or "far left." It is still short of the 

all-time high of 40.9 percen~ which was recorded in 
1971. 

The plurality of students, 49.5 percen~ identified 
themselves as "middle of the road~ 

UCSD biologists discover dual 
role for celr division protein 

A team of UCSD biologists has discovered that 
the embl'(onic development of the first axis of an 
animal is linked to a protein complex that has long 
been known to be key in cell division. 

The finding was printed in the Februal'( issue of 
the joumal Developmental Cell. 

The find ings show how the cell sets up the mole-
cular differences between organsims developing outer 
layer and inner layer. The team found that the protein 
complex Anaphase-Promoting Complex appears to 
play a central role in embryoniC development 

Scientists have long known that the complex 
plays a key role in preparing the cell for division by 
allowing it to progress through the metaphase to its 
anaphase transition in the cell cycle. This new infor-
mation will help scientists to better understand the 
developmental cycle. 

The research team was composed of Raffi V. 
Aroian, an assistant professor of biology at UCSD; 
Akiko Tagawa, a graduate student in Aroian's lab; 
Bruce Bowerman, a professor of biology at the 
University of Oregon; Rebecca Lyczak, a postdoctor-
al fellow in Bowerman's lab; and Chad A. Rappleye,

"[The protestors] are expanding

locate a storage container so they 
can accomplis h their work," 
Ratcliff said. "There is no larger 
plot. There is nothing Sinister 
going on here." 

UCSD has coopenlted with stu-
dents' concerns aboU[ the storage 
shed, according to Ratcliff. 

"The universi ty has been open 
and responsive," Ratcl iff said. "I'm 
optimistic that a mutually satisfac-
tory resolution will be achieved." 

T he Che Cafe was origina lly 
notified about the shed's construc-
tion during winter quarter. The 
cafe was unhappy with the develop-
ment, Bohling said. 

However, the cafe was willing to 
negotiate as long as some terms 
were met, including guarantees 
that the shed would be temporary 
and that parking for cafe patrons 
would not be impaired. The 
adminisc-ation verba lly agreed that 
th ese demands were reasonable. 

However, me administration 
has not signed any documents 
acknowledging these negoti ations.

ness to work with Groundwork in 
bringing materials to students. 

a verbal confirmation that our pro-
posed agreement was reasonable 
and would be signed. This has not 
happened." 

The Che Cafe is part of the 
student-run cooperatives affiliated 
with the Student Center, which 
also includes the General Store 
and a the Food Co-op. The cafe is 
home to a number of activist 
groups, se rves vegetarian food, 
and regularly hosts special events, 
political meetings and musica l 
shows. 

The Che Cafe now resides in a 
building that was originally part of 
the Camp Matthews lnilitary base. 
Once UCSD was established, the 
structure became a part of the orig-
inal Student Center in the late 
1960s. In the mid-1970s, the build-
ing stood empty for two years, at 
which point the administration was 
planning to turn it into a faculty 
club. 

According to Bohling, students 
objected and produced documenta-
tion revealing mat former students 
had originally paid for the estab-
lishment's construction. Thus the 
building was renovated, and by 
1981 became what is now known as 
the Che Cafe. 

According to Ratcliff, the cafe 
was never purchased with student 
fees, and UCSD is still the owner 
of the facility as part of the 
Student Center. He al so said the 
area in the vicinity of the cafe is 
not considered a part of the 

"If Groundwork would like our 
book list we'll give it to them and 
their business might go up," Turk 
said. "Why would a professor not 
want a student to have a choice?" 

Workers at the UCSD Bookstore 
said students often have a hard time 
with Groundwork Books. 

"A lot of students would come 
over because they were frustrated 
because mey couldn't find [tl1cir 
book) or tl1C lines were too long," 
said Teri Denherder of the UCSD 
Bookstore. 

Co-worker Margot Burger 
thought mat a major complaint 
against Groundwork was the fact 
that they don't take credit cards. 

Elizabeth Beatus, a Marshall 
senior, said divided between sup-
porting the co-op and the conve-
nience that the UCSD Bookstore 
offers . 

"I think it's beneficia l to have all 
the books in one place because it's 
more efficient, but at the same time 
it is necessary to support student-
run organizations," Beatus said. 
"Groundwork is a good place to 
provide books needed by students." 

May Deguzman, an ethnic tud-
ies major and Groundwork employ-
ee, said me administration should 
support student-run organizations. 

"I think as a vice chancellor of 

Student Center. 
"The 'Memorandum of 

Understanding' ... states clearly 
that the Che Cafe is allowed by me 
university to occupy the 1,050 
square feet of space inside the facil-
ity," Ratcliff said. "This is not 
defined as any exterior space." 

Bohling feels differently. 
"Everything around Price 

Center is considered part of the 
center, from the ATM machines to 
most of Library Walk," Bohling 
said. "This area is not clearl y 
defined, but it is part of the struc-
ture 's responsibilities. In the same 
way, the Che Cafe takes responsi-
bility for the area around it." 

"Students and volunteers have 
put a great deal of work into main-
taining [me Che Cafe)," said an 
angry cafe patron who requested to 
remain anonymous. "The universi-
ty takes the cafe seriously enough 
to want to get rid of it, but not seri-
ously enough to stop playing 
games." 

However, Ratcliff said their 
concerns will be addressed. 

"We don't want to minimize the 
students' concerns," Ratcliff said. 
"We want to make sure they are 
addressed. Yet the students have 
expanded the issue: In a way, 
mey're keeping this storage con-
tainer hostage in order to add other 
things on their agenda. T his is not 
tied to any other initiative. It's just 
a storage container ... there is no

Proposal would 
deprive students 
of housing choices 

UCS D _ Housing and Dining Services 
needs hal t a billion doll:m. To raise this 
money, it is considering;1I1 overhaul of undcr-
gr,ldu;lre on-campus housing rates that would 
cre,l te a single, universa l rate for all single-
occupancy rooms, and one for all dOllble-
occupancy rooms on campus. T he ra te would 
appl\' to residence halls and apartments, and 
would requi re 311 undergr3duate students liv-
ing on campll to purchase a meal plan. 

One Rate, as the proposal is called, would 
make livi ng in the aparmlents and living in 
the residence halls the same price. 

According to HDS, the pricing overhaul 
would bring in needed cashflow to improve 
current facilities, and fund over half a billion 
dollars in planned construction over the next 
10 years to accommodate the ever-growing 
demand for housing and dining facibties. 

Because I-IDS is required to be self-suffi-
cient, it is in somewhat of a bind. However, 
eliminating so much tudent choice in on-
campus services is not the only solution to its 
nn:lIlcial crisis. 

nder the current system, a student in a 
double-occupancy room in an on-campus 
apartment is projected to pay. $4,687 for the 
2002 -2003 school year, with the option of 
buying a meal plan. If One Rate were enact-
ed, tllis same student would be required to 
purchase a meal plan, and the cost would 
Jump to $7,100 - the same price that a stu-
dent in a double-occupancy room in the resi-
dence halls would pay. In addition to the meal 
plan, the student Living in the apartment 
would also be purchasing a mandatory week-
ly maid service. 

Though the price of living in the residence 
halls would decrease by about $1,100 for the 
year, this is no excuse to force apartment res-
idents to buy maid service and a meal plan. 
True, the lowered residence halls rate will 
probably make UCSD more attractive to 
IIlcoming freshmen, but these students will 
not get a better deal- they will just pay for it 
their second year when they bve in the apart-
ments, if they are lucky enough to even get 
one. 

It may appear that students living in the 
residence halls would be seeing all die bene-
fits of One Rate. However, this is not the case. 
Residence halls have fewer amenities and they 
close during the breaks - yet they will be 
paying the same amount as residents of on-
campus apartments. To charge them the same 
price as for an apartment - which is open for 
more than a month longer and has more 
amenities - is a sham. 

Current an-campus apartment residents 
p~y about $485 per month for rent, cable and 
utilities. This is quite low compared to the 
San Diego housing market. Raisll1g this price 
to something that better reflects the going 
rate in the area would be better than shoving 
extra services down the throats of on-campus 
apartment residents to generate extra income. 

T he Gllfrrdinn recognizes that UCSD 
I lousing and Dining Services needs a lot of 
money, and that it can only raise it by some-
how increasing cash flow. Sadly, this must 
mean rclising pri es. However, One Rate's 
stra tcb'Y of generating the extra revenues 
throll<!h a program that masks higher prices 
with J1e illusion of more services is misguided. 
The flir solution is to base future price adjust-
ments on the value of the services provided, 
while sti ll providing students who W1 h to live 
on campus the options they currently enjoy.

Leaving La Jolla is not the magic 
antidote to rising cost of living 

Moving outside the city is not an a~tomatic 
ticket for a decrease in expenditure 

By ANDREW QUADRI 
Senior Staff Writer 

If you think you could save a lot on 
rent by moving out of La Jolla, you're 
right. But if you think that by doing that, 
you could save a lot overall, think again. 

Everyone knows that rent in La J olla 
is expensive, but you're paying for a 
prime location. You may have already 
noticed that the UCSD area is much 
prettier than, for example, EI Cajon. 

Rent is usually a person's biggest 
monthly expense, so many assume that a 
lower housing cost equals a lower cost of 
living overall. On the surface, cheap rent 
can look like a great deal. In reality, it 
may be an expensive mistake. 

It's easy to be lured to an area because 
it has rock bottom ~ent. Most people 
have a psychologica l fear of spending a 
large amounr of money ' at one time . 
Given a choice, most people would 
rather spend $300 instead of $700 at 
once, if the apparent item - in this 
instance, all apartment - were the same. 
But you need to look at more than just 
rent to know if you are living as cheaply 
as you think you arc . You need to look at 
time as money, and vice versa. 

\Vhen you live farther away from La 
Jolla, rent becomes less expensive, but 
driving here gets more expensive . 
Everything else - groceries, entertain-
mem, clothing - co ts about the same 
no matter where you live, so we only 
need to look at the factors \vith the 
biggest differences: rent and transporta-
tion. For the sake of implicity, the trans-
portation co ts only include the co t of 
dri\;ng to ancl from sc hool, no t your tri ps 
to the store, to work o r to the mall. 

A typical three-bedroom apartment 
in La J o lla goes for 2, 100 per month. If 
you want your own room, you pay $700 
per month. You thcn drive about four 
miles round-trip to campus each day, or 
about 0 miles per month. At 50 cents 
per mil e - accounti ng for maintenance, 
in urancc, fue l and car paymen ts - you 
pay about +0 per month to drive to 
chool and $50 per m onth to park there. 

Your total cost for rent and transporta-
tion in La Jolla: $790 per month. 

The lowest price you'll find for a single 
bedroom in EI Cajon is about $300 -
many places are more expensive than that, 
but very few are cheaper - in a $900 per 
month three-bedroom residence. Here, 
you drive about 40 miles round-trip to 
campus each day, or a bout 800 miles per 
month. At 35 cents per mile (driving gets 
more economical over longer distances), 
you pay $280 per month driving to school, 
and $50 parking. Your total cost in EI 
Cajon: $630 per month . At first glance, 
this seems nice: You have saved $160 per 
month by moving to El Cajon. 

But at what cost? 

If you live two miles away, 
you can choose from 

driving, taking the bus -
UCSD provides a free bus 

pass for routes near 
campus - or riding your 

bike. 

If you're lucky and you have a job that 
pays $10 per hoW", you would need to 
work 79 hours evelY month (70 of them to 
pay for rent, nine to pay for ·youT trips to 
school) to live in La Jolla. Your 80 miles of 
driving to and from campus takes a total of 
about seven hours. So you would spend 86 
hours every month to live in La Jolla, two 
miles away from campus . 

Working at that same $10 per hour 
job, you would need to work only 63 
hours every month (30 of it to pay rent, 
33 to PdY fo r your trips to school) to live 
in EI Cajon. But your 800 mil es of dri -
ving every month tends to take about 33 
more hours of your time. You spend 99 
hours every month to live in EI Cajon , 20 
miles away from campus. By living in EI 
Cajon, you have saved 160 per month at 
a cost of 13 hours of your time. You are 
effectively compensa ted for that ertra 13 
hours at a rate of $12.31 per hour. 

If you hate your job but love sitting in 
traffic, EI Cajon could be right for you . 
If your job is so great that you acrually 
enjoy working there and would rather 
not waste 33 hours sitting in traffic, La 
Jolla might be a better bet. 

Lets rerum to location: La Jolla is 
close to the beach and its weather is tem-
perate. EI Cajon is 20 miles away from the 
beach and in the desert, where it is often 
80 degrees during the day and 40 degrees 
the same night. If you live in LaJolla , you 
lnight go to the beach or just exercise 
more often, since its more convenient and 
comfortable to do so. At the very least, 
you'll save money on utilities, since you 
won't be air-conditioning your apartment 
as often. Vour savings can diminish rapid-
ly thanks to extra utility costs. 

Some more on loca tion: If you live in 
EI Cajon, you have no practical choice 
but to dri ve to UCSD. Even with a car, 
20 miles is a long way. If your car breaks 
down, you ca n't get to school vcry casily. 
Even a die-hard transit rider or bicyclist 
won't do a 40-mile rou nd -trip to and 
from cam pus. 

If you live two miles away, you can 
choose from driving, taking the bus -
UCSD provides a free bus pass for 
routes near campus - or riding your 
bike. You could eve n walk to the Regents 
parking shuttle and take that the rcst of 
the way to campus. You could also save 
$50 per month on a parking permit - or 
morc, if your ca r ever gets ticketed - by 
walking or bicycling. 

What if YOll forget something impor-
tant at home or YOll realize you need to 
study at Geisel Library on a S:ltLlrday? 
From La Jolla, the extra clrive costs you 
$2; from EI Cajon it costs $14. Abo, the 
shorter trip only requires one hour o f 
your time instead of three - rememhe r 
that you necd to account for th e time 
spent driving and the time you work to 
pay fo r the tri p.

5 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Superficial values abound in 
much of the male gay community 
Serious re-examination of priorities by community 
is neccesary for progress in Hillcrest and beyond 
By VALERIE BURNS 
Senior Staff Writer 

] have one question that I will 
address to Hillcrest as a whole: 
" Where the women at?" 

J am convinced that Hillcrest is 
run by a bunch of gay men who all 
roughly resemble each other: c1ean-
Cllt, muscular, ostensibly well-off, 
white, and between 20 and 40 years 
old. The conullunity that is sup-
posed to be the most diverse is quite 
the opposite. Mile Hillcrest is like-
ly dle most accepting 'burb of San 
Diego, it is not in any way diverse. 

It consists mainly of a particular 
age group of males, all white Anglo-
Saxon Protestants. It is disappoint-
ing that the community I identify 
\vidll110 t - speaking as a lesbian-
I acrually identify least with. 

] don't relate to conspicuous con-
sumption - the concept sickens me. 
As one cruises down University 
Avenue, ] see 1Il0sdy white gay men 
and only a few lesbian and elderly 
people. Hillcrest smells of sex, 
money, lost dreams, poor-ass les-
bians and rich gay men flouting their 
money. 

Upon my introduction to 
Hillcrest, I thought I had found my 
Cloud Nine, my haven, my home. 
After living there for seven months,] 
barely visi t the heart of Hillcrest, 
unless I'm in a carefree or bored 
mood. 11,ere is plenty to look at if 
you enjoy watching young gay men 
walking with their butts in the air 
and looking at their bulging pects, 
which are hilariously bigger than a 
lot of lesbians' breasts. 

I have a bone to pick with the 
major ity of gay men I see in 
Hillcrest. Don't worry boys, I sym-
pathize with your sexual orientation 
and the secondary stan,s we as 
homosexuals are given in society. 

But why~ Why, as my friend 
Suzie would say, are you a "huge dis-
play of nothingness?" You all dress 
the same, work out and diet. And 
you endlessly gossip about one 
another 's sex lives and social lives in 

a way that is neither interesting nor 
engaging. Why do you do so many 

dnrgs~ \Vhy, when society is moving 
to accept homosexuality for bodl my 
and your benefi ts, do you insist on 
self-destruction in this process oflib-
eralizati on? 

There is clearly a light at the end 
of the American Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual Transgender civil rights 
runnel, and yet you continue on this 
dangerous path. \Vhy do you 
embody alcoholism, drug addiction, 
mass materialism, conspicuous con-
sumption - all dut is bad - and 
then at the same time seem to do so 
much good in society? So many gay 
men are caring and have so much to 
give, and at the same time give 0 lit-
tle to themselves. 

Before it sounds like I'm doing an 
endless critique of the gay men I see 
and know in Hillcrest, let me base 
my analysis on something concrete. 

Drug and alcohol overuse is 
something that I can only perceive 
or assume happens behind closed 
doors in the many gay bars and eI ubs 
in Hillcrest and the rest of San 
Diego, or else I have wimessed it in 
the behavior of my own gay friends. 
The mass materialism, conspicuous 
consumption and excessive vanity 
that I see daily in Hillcrest are what 
have set off anger toward much of 
the gay male community. 

\Vhy do they all look the same? 
Why do they flaunt money like it's 
going out of style? No doubt, the 
U.S. gay male population is the 
trend-setter of this country. The 
spiky-hair look, the "man bag," the 
artistic facial hair display: These are 
all becoming widely copied fads 
today in straight male Americans. It 
is interesting that some straight 
males who are a little too stylish or 
(gasp!) good-looking are often 
assumed to be gay. 

\Vhy must a sector of the gay 
community thrive and depend on 
appearance so much~ Why is it 
assumed that all male hair stylists 
and interior decorators are gay? 
D oes anyone ever question these 

stereotypes? Growing up, I never 
did. This emphasis on appearance 
make gay men often gorgeous and 
attractive, leaving much of the 
American population staring and 
jealous. 

Will gay men continue to be 
"huge displays of nothingness" for-
ever? Tllis "nothingness" implies 
what is truly an emptiness, a lack of 
charactcr or a laek of desire to have a 
character in society's view, a conse-
quence of so much time spent 
putting up walls to avoid thinking 
about how society perceives them. It 
is true that this constructed wall has 
enforced a look of nonchalance from 
gay men toward society. It has 
helped the gay male communi ty 
snap the strings that connected it to 
mainstream heterosexual society 30 
years ago. 

However, the situation has 
changed and gay men are very much 
on the forefront of American society 
today. "\Vi II and Grace" \vill soon 
take over the No. I spot in the 
Nielsen ratings, and "Queer as Folk" 
is returning for its second season on 
Showtime as its highest-rated show. 

\Vith all this success, it is fright-
en.ing, disheartening and sad to see 
such a strong and intelligent group 
of men prefer the maintenance of 
the material outside over the intro-
spective inside. Perfection on the 
outside may bring temporary satis-
faction, but it probably will not 
secure long-term happiness and sta-
bility. It is sad that a group of mosdy 
upstanding citizens is known by soci-
ety for its pettiness, quiek wit (a 
defense mechanism), good looks and 
vanity. 

On the whole;:, I do not relate to 
many in my own gender, and lately 
many of my gay guy friends seem to 
be vying for this same position in my 
heart. There is no doubt that 
straight women are catty, petty, often 
jealous and territorial. It seems that 
gay men are making a bid for that 
same personality.

Editor: 
r am little confused over your 

Uan. 24J editorial, "Useless reso-
lutions are a waste of time, 
resources," and I hope that we can 
clea r up a few items. 

The title's point goes without 
questi on. But r am confused about 
your attacks on A.S . Council reso-
lu tions as being "usel ess" and 
"pointl ess," as well as your asser-
ti ons that the A.S. Council does 
not work to "represent student 
opin ion" or "actively work to 
add ress stud ent concerns and 
needs. " 

[ am not aware of any useless 
resolutio ns passed by the I\.S . 

Council and [ don't beli eve the 
" Resolution Supporting America's 
Institutions" falls into that catego-
ry. [ say this because I whole-
heartedly believe the A.S. Council 
does exist to "represent student 
opin ion." T herefore, when a reso-
lu tion was presented by one of 
those snldents whom we repre-
sent, as well as supported by 280 
signatures from those students, we 
took notice . 

I do not know about the 
Guardiall but I am not about to 
tell 280 students that their opin.-
ion is unimportant to the A.S. 
Council. I wouldn't tell one stu-
dent that their opinion is not 
important. The A.S. Council takes 
the time to address all items 
brought before it with its utmost 
attention. Student opinion is not a 
waste of time to us . 

In addition, the A.S . Council 
does "actively work to address stu-
dent concerns and needs." You 
stated that there are "half-empty 
facul ty floors and ever-overflow-
ing student floors," but if you 
looked at the statistics, at peak 
times 'I\' spots are 20 percent 
vacant, 'B' spots are 13 percent 
vacant, and'S' are 23 percent 
vacant. Students actually have 
more open parking spots than the 
faculty and your statemem is sim-
ply not true. 

The A.S. Council still actively 
fights for student parking needs . 
Last year the A.S. Council 
Representative to Transportation 
successfully lobbied for gradua ted 
permit-fee plan, so in the future 
student parking fees will be lower. 
Keeping student fees down is a 
need of all students. Also, last 
week, a resolution to be presented 
to UCSD Transportation and 
Parking Services was given to the 
A.S. Council and will be submit-

ted to the coll ege councils rega rd -
ing freshman parking. The A.S. 
Council is fighcing to safeguard 
freshman parking from being 
eliminated. 

When you mentioned the A.S. 
Council 's plan to "expand shuttle 
service" you forgot to finish the 
sentence. It actually read "expand 
shuttle service to and from the 
airport," which is something we 
are working on. In addition, TPS 
has made a proposal to expand the 
shuttle services and that will prob-
ably go into effect next year. 

If you are so interested in park-
ing issues, you should have 
applied to be the A.S. 
Representative to the 
Transportation Policy Committee 
(there was only one applicant, an 
A.S . Council member). I could go 
on about the other issues, but in 
the interest of using my time on 
more "pro-active efforts," I will 
stop. 

In conclusion, let me make two 
suggestions. Please contact your 
A.S. representatives via e-mail at 
asse1late@ucsd.tdu. Secondly, I 
invite you to attend an A.S. 
Council meeting (Wednesdays at 
6:30 p.m. in the Price Center 
Ballrooms) . 

I encourage you to attend so in 
the future when you try to blast 
the A.S. Council for not working 
on student issues, you might find 
something true to type instead of 
the fabrications you printed in 
your edi torial. 

Please do not waste srudents' 
time and registration fee money in 
the future with such ~ubbish.

Hillcrest: 
Vanity of gay men rein-
forces stereotypes 
Continued from page 5 

I don't want to end this article 
leaving a negative taste of the 
LGBT community in the mouths 
of readers. In a way, the obsession 
with looks and appearance was the 
most ingenious way for gay men to 
climb out of the closet. 

It could be said that they beat 
conservative America at its own 
game. They marketed themselves: 
their looks, wit, singing, dancing 
- it's all an act. Gay men are 
thirst-quenching entertainment 
for TV-cultured, ad-infected 
America to drool over instead of 
taking Ritalin. America can't 
argue with looks, success or 
entertainment satisfaction, no 
matter what bibles "say." 

Living in La Jolla now costs 
just $440 per month. Get ready 
for a shock: Living in El Cajon 
now costs $480 per month . You're 
not only spending more money to 
live there, but also spending four 
extra hours at work and 26 extra 
hours in traffic to do it. Suddenly, 
paying $150 a month for rent 
doesn't look so great. 

Living far away for "cheap 
rent" does not always save time or 
money, often ends lip costing YOll 
more of both, and always ends up 
costing society more. 

T he bottom line is that you 
really need to do the math before 
deciding where to live. Calculate 
all your expenses, not just rent, 
and calculate tlle cost to society, 
not just your own. 

Gay men have taken their 
finesse at appearance to the 'burbs 
by marketing their fashion and hair 
designs to young WAS.P. boys 
interested in attracting girls and 
women in the same way that gay 
men, with astounding efficiency, 
attract themselves. 

This illustrates how the con-
spicuous consumption and exces-
sive vanity of gay men has removed 
barriers; many young men, espe-
cially in urban, white California, 
resemble gay men three to five 
years ago in fashion and hair sense. 
I have often witnessed young 
W.A.S.P. men dressed neatly, 
clean-cut, with spiky hair and 
Abercrombied-out, using "fag" in a 
derogatory way when, in reality, 
they themselves resemble the 
"fags" of a few minutes ago. 

American boys beware l How 
can you have permanent animosity 
toward a hITouP of people YOll yearn 
to be like'

A.S. Council recommends the 
removal of StudentLink photos 
Resolution calls for an end to the program that allows 
faculty and staff to view student ill card pictures 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council asked the 
administration to sto p the program 
that allows student identification 
card photos to be viewed by faculty 
and staff on StudentLink. 

The Jan. 23 resolution, titled 
"Resolution Stating the Concerns 
and Stating Recommendations 
Regarding Studentlink Photos," was 
submitted by Senate Chair Nick 
Lieberknecht. 

The resolution comes after dis-
cussions between A.S. President Jeff 
Dodge and Vice Chancellor Joseph 
Watson. 

According to Lieberknecht, it 
was Watson who wanted the official 
position of the students. He said this 
is the message with which Dodge 
returned from the meetings. 

"I feel like we've begun discus-
sions on creatively finding solutions 
to address as concerns," Dodge said.

UCSD Bookstore. 

"I am curious as to how books 
that I ordered from Groundwork

members of the A.S. Council -
went out to constituents to gauge 
the position of the students. 

"It was brought up to college 
councils and it was brought up to 
constituents," Lieberknecht said. 

Lieberknecht said that when he 
personally went to students with 
the question, he received mixed 
responses. 

"Some students were fine with 
having their photos available," he 
said. "But there were enough of my 
constituents that said, 'Hey Nick, I 
don't like this,' tha t we wan ted to 
do something about it to protect 
those people." 

The resolution states the rea-
sons for the recommended removal 
of the photos, which are available 
to staff and faculty for the first time 
this year. 

Lieberknecht expressed that 
students are concerned that the 
practice could open the door to 
stereotyping or profiling. 

The resolution also cites the lack 

able at the university bookstore," 
Klein said. 

Klein said she wants to see con-
venience for students but is skepti-
cal of attempts at undermining co-
op organizations. 

"My reaction is that I feel a lit-
tle bit torn," she said. "I like the 
convenience this would offer to 
students, but in so far as it might 
undercut Groundwork, I think that 
might be a shame. I would like to 

of information available to students 
about the lise of their photos, the 
absence ofa limit on which members 
of the faculty and staff can access the 
photos and a risk of personal safety 
as reasons against the practice. 

Earlier recommendations by the 
A.S. Council were to provide a way 
for students to opt out of allowing 
their picture to be put up, and to 
have students sign a waiver when 
they take their ID card photos. 

The new resolution asks for the 
program to be discontinued entirely 
and for an opt-out to be available 
until then. Through the resolution, 
the A.S. Council calls on the admin-
istration to send out a letter inform-
ing students that their lD card pho-
tos are available for this program. 

Lieberknecht is optimistic about 
the administration's reaction to the 
resolution. 

"1 think some of the points we 
made will be hard to ignore," he 
said. UI think we might be able to 
get them to take a second look." 

see it couple with pro-active efforts 
to support Groundwork." 

According to Watson, 
Groundwork Books would not be 
ruined and the UCSD Bookstore's 
prices would be controlled by an 
advisory committee. 

Watson said he is open to other 
ways of clearing up book location 
confusion, including a creation of a 
Web site on which professors must 
post book sales locations.

Crazy antics deemed

on the set of 
upcoming comedy

After an IInprompru Frlshee ses-sioll in the drop-off zone of thl.! I Iyan Regency in La Jolla, I was 
able to stop Devon Sawa of 
"Sl:!ckcrs" and get background infor-
1l1:l{iOIl .Ibour the set. Fresh from a 
d:ly of classic ding-dong-ditch in the 
Ilyan, the 23-ye:tr-old Vancouver 
nall\'c se ttled ;n and assumed a calm, 
collected, good interview front -
backward cap and aiL 

JK: Does a moming of ding-dong-
ditch mean that the set of 
"Slackers" was crazy, too? 
DS: Yeah, we're making the hotel 
upset. The set lOa definitely crazy. A 
101 of crazy stuff went on. 

JK: The classic Hollywood pin-up 
icon '\-!amie VanDOI'en makes an 
appearance in an intimate sponge 
bath scene. ~'hat was it like work-
ing with someone who has been in 
the business for so long? 
D : I did get to meet her, but very 
briefly. I was watching the scene from 
bchind the cameras and it was hard to 
keep the bughter in. That was all 
impro" . ' ca h, Uasonl Schwartzman 
just came up with all that tuff. He 
JUSt went nuts and she went along 
with it ... lie is just so extremely tal-
ented yuu would often hear the direc-
tor sayi ng, "God Devon, stOP Iaugh-
ing

'
" and I'd say, "No, I can't. 

Schwartzman is JUSt so funny!" 

JK: How much of the movie was 
improv? 
DS: Oh jecz, I'd say about 0 percent 
of that film was improvised. There 
was :1 lot of acting added to the script. 

JK: Was the original script as fUJUly?

A brief conversation with 'The Smallest Band in Rock Music' 
Canadian punk-rockers Sum 41 explain that the sound of a breaking television is not what you may think 

B ct you didn't know you could get a tattoo at RIMAC, did you? \Vcll, most mortals can't, 
hut when you arc busy rock stars 
like Sum 4 I, all the amenitie -

'ingcr Dcryck Vv'hibley and bassis t 
Jason "Conc" 1\ IcCaslin sat down 
for somc Q and A, Ilcinekcns in 
hand. 

LB: ow, you guys have reputa-
tions for being big partiers on 
the road. Do you have any good 
stories to tell me? 
Detyck \Vhihley: Really' We don't 
drink (laughs). 

Cone McCaslin: Well, college peo-
ple drink all the time, right? 

LB: Any hotel rooms trashed? 
OW: It all happens. Some bands 
chose not to do it. I don't know 
why - maybe bee Ise they're not 
into it, or they think it's cliche .... 
CM: J[ ave you ever heard the 
sound of a TV breaking' 
DW: It's weird. It's a vacuum tube, 
so they ... implode. It's not like a 
breaking sound, it's more like a pop 
sound. 0 anyway, it can happen. 
[Somel bands choo e not to, and 
we were just one of tile bands that 
chose to do it, I glless. 

LB: Steve did an episode of 
"MTV Crib ," and showed off 
his parents' house. Do you all 
still live at home? 

DW: Well, we live on a bus, so we 
don't really live anywhere. But 
when we go home for three days, 
every now and then, we go to our 
parents' house. We were all just 
home for a month. I've never even 
thought of getting a house ... and 
then when r was home, I thought, 
"I need to buy a house," because [ 
got bored and I had nothing to do. 
By the time I found some that I 
liked, it was like, "up, you're leav-
ing for tour in two days," so I did-
n't buy a house. 

LB: So have you guys seen the 
new Rolling Stone Readers' Poll? 
You guys cleaned up. 
D'vV: I didn't even know what it 
was. I came homc one day ... at 
Christma and Illy mom had it and 
she just showed it to me. 

CM: We have some very die-hard 
fans, I guess. 
DW: And they're clearly the best-
dressed. 

LB: Many people think it's odd 
that a Canadian band sounds so 
much like Orange County punk 
rock. Who did you listen to 
growing up? 
DW: Vh, bands from Orange 
County. The whole Fat Wreck 

hords, Epitaph kind of stuff is the 
kind of punk rock we got into. 

LB: So what are your top five 
albums? 
CM: Tenacious D, Jimmy Eat 
World, H20, The Strokes ... So 
that's top four of the year. 
DW: Of all timc; Weezer (the first 
one), Gun 'n' Roses' " ppeti te 

For Destruction," Foo Fighters' 
"The Color and the Shape," John 
Lennon's "Imagine" and Nirvana's 
"Nevermind ... 

LB: I wouldn't expect Nirvana to 
be on there. 
CM: That's why we started playing 
music. 
DW: When we started playing 
music, that was when Nirvana was 
at their height. It's almost cliche, 
but the time is now. In a couple 
more years - three more years, 
five more years - it ,viII be rcally 
cool to say you like Nirvana again. 

LB: I~ there anything else about 
you that would surprise people? 
OW: We're a lot small er in person. 
CM: We're like the smallest band 
in rock music.

Clever 'Slackers' isn't your ordinary 
'American Pie' gross-out movie 
Jason Schwartzman provides fun as an emotionally 
imbalanced student who sets his eye on a female 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

When it comes to cheating, the men of "Slackers" arc too enterprising for their own good. They spend their innovation 
and expertise orchestrating power outages, fire 

alarlll~ and faking broken bunes to cheat on 
tc,rs. Dave (Dc von Sawa), Sam (Jason Segal) 
and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are 45 days 
away from their diplomas, having chcated on 
CVCIY midterm and tinal they could. 

Cheating commences through midterms, 
but Ethan's powcrful crush throws a glitch in 
the scheme. "Cool Ethan" U ason 
Schwartzman) catches Dave in phase two of 
the cheati ng process and gathers some incrim-
inating evidcnce. Eth:lI1 gets this only after he 
think that Dave is moving in on his crush, 
Angela, played by modelJaco'ess James King. 

\.vhilc examining Angela's cha ir in physics 
class for a strand of her hair to add to his hair 
doll, Ethan grabs a crib sheet, as well as the 
mcrcy of Dave, Sam and Jeff. What follows 
is a blackmail proposition to get Angela to 
like Ethan. If Ethan doesn't get the girl, he 
squeals like a pig to the administration to get 
the boys expelled from I lolden University. 

Here romance crawls into the scrip t and 
Angela begins to be the object of more than 
Ethan's desire - he builds a shrine and t1lrns 
Angeb while she's nOt looking. 

The cameos succeed in this 111m . . n inti-
\lIalC look at aging Hullywood pin-up Mamie 
VanDoren i, hilarious, shocking and outra-
geolls - all rolled into a pair of very aug-
mented breasts. A quick shot of Cameron 

Devon: 
'A big hairy bra' is one of the gifts 
Sawa has received through the years 
Continued from page 8 

DS: When I read thc original script and got 
to the montage sequence, [ just thought it 
was funny as hell. All the different things-
a lesbian lIlake-ollt session, the singing and 
dancing penis - it was raw and original. 

JK: Had you ever been in a cheating situ-
ation in school or life? 
DS, I have not because it was so hard for me 
growing up becausc I had a sct teacher for 
most of my li fe, so you got one guy in a trail-
er stari ng at you for three hours. There is no 
way of cheating there. There is no way of 
slacking off, there is no way of skipping 
chool or cheating on your test. 

JK: Do you see · any of yourself in your 
ch'lracter Dave? 
DS: ot at all . At the high school age, I was 
about a foot shortcr than all the gi rls and a lit-
tle quir!..,. and ski nny, and so I didn't havc a 
lot of girlfriends. Dave is very smooth; always 
been the popular guy. We arc pretty different. 

J K: How did the crew handle all the cast 

Diaz with 001 Ethan is almost believable. 
"Slackers" is an off-beat comedy that makes 

one wonder, "What are they trying to say to 
me'" The movie could lJe saying that hunesty 
will get you everything, that only the ambitious 
su (ced, that ulere is a fine line betwcen psy-
chologically disturbed stalkers and crushes, 0r 
commenting on ule power of love. 

It plays like a scene in the mind of evelY 
student who always wanted to hack into the 
system 01' flip an offen ive tinger to the 
teaching assistant 

Commercials already in heavy circulation 
portr:IY "Slackers" as a feci-good "Amcrican 
Pic" flick, when it actually delivers a very dif-
ferent plot. chwarrzman, who \Va, "not 
afraid to expel" the cheating gang, seems 
emotionally imbalanced. 

The movie does have its laugh-aut-loud 
part, especia lly when Sam and the red-
haired, sideburnedJeffhandlc their re ponsi-
bilities of cheating in the group. 

Don't expect a slapstick comedy, but 
rather a more offbeat comedy that contains 
imaginary "Star W:us" sequences :lIlel singing 
and dancing genitals. "Slackers" muld really 
give you some ambition in college - if you 
are a stalker or a chearer, that is.

DS: We or course at times were goofi ng off. 
\Ve pissed off the props people pretty good. 
By law, YOll can't drink beer on film, so they 
change the beer to water, but we decided to 
switch it back to beer.

JK: When "Casper" came out you were 15,

Club Ritmo: X-Ecutioners drop all of 
the killer beats at Porter's Pub 
B MARISA CiUnERREZ 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council will soon present the second night in its series of shows for Club RiullO, which will feature the tal-
ented turntablisrs the X-Ecutioners. 

T he X-Ecutioncrs, the New York-based 
quartet of DJs, are nationally and internation-
ally renowncd for their rcmarkable turntable 
stylings. Formed in 1989, tile group is com-
prised of four members: Rob Swift, Roc Raida, 
Total Eclipse and Mista inista. 

Formerly known as the X-Men, the DJ 
crew prides itlielf on its ability to create tracks 
entirely by hand, as opposed to using samplers 
and sequencing machines. 'nle X-Ecutioners 
have dedicated thcir lives to pcrfc'Cting the art 
of DJing, which they describe as "mixing, 
scratching, body tricks and beat-juggling." 

The crew pioneered beat-juggling, 
described by Swift as "manipulating a kick 
snare and high hat off a record and reorganiz-
ing the sounds to create a totally different 
composition the same way one would do \vidl 
a sampling or sequencing mach.ine." 

The X-Ecutioners are alllong the first all -
DJ outfits ever to sign a recording contract. 
This amazingly gifted foursome can be heard 
on their new album, "Built From Scratch," to 
be avai lable in late February. 

The club targets the 18-a nd-over crowd 
and i open to the general public, so if you're 
looking for some slamming beats and all-
:tround cool DJing, then SlOp by Purter's Pub 
to see the renowned turma ble masters, the 
X-Ecutioners. 

Please look to the hiatus calendar on page 11

The Calling 
Camino Palmero 

RCA Records 

*** 
While the group The 

Calling may not sound too 
familiar, their song 
"Wherever You Will Go" 
will. It has been getting lots 
of airplay on the radio and 
considerable time on MTv. 
It was also performed live 
in the film "Coyote Ugly." 

"Camino Palmero" is 
the group's first RCA 
record. This group con-
sists of Alex Band singing 
vocals, Aaron Kamin and 
Sean Woolstenhulme on 
guitar, Billy Mohler on the 
bass and Nate Wood on 
drums. 

The II-song album was 
written by Band and 
Kamin, the founding 
members of the group. 
Many of the songs consist 
of the usual theme of a 
romance gone wrong and 
the feelings of the one who 

was jilted, such as 
"Adrienne, " with the cho-
rus, "Adrienne, I thought I 
knew you! Oncc again, you 
uscd mc, used me." 

I [owevcr, there are a 
few songs tha t have 
unique themes that haven't 
been overdone several 
times already this year. 
One such example is 
"We're Forgiven," which 
calls the listener back to 
reality with lines such as "I 
pass them on the streets! 
Their bloodstained hands 
and dirty feetl And I can't 
ignore them! Any more 
than r already have." 

The music is not excep-
tionally good or original, 
but The Calling maintains 
a strong pop sound that 
carries through the album. 
Each track has a slightly 
different sound, but the 
album sounds rather uni-
form in tone. Some of the 
songs, such as "Wherever 
You Will Go," have a bal-
lad quality that is quite 
soothing. Then there is 
"Unstoppable," which 
sounds more like alterna-
tive rock. 

This album is good, but 
not great. Many of the 
songs sound rather famil-
iar, but there are a few that 
make this album a good 
one to spend the ride home 
with .

Various Artists 
Paris Lounge 

Musicrama 

*** 
There is a distinctive 

sound to French electron-
ica . Daft Punk and Bob 
Sinclar have been a couple 
of the more popular 
artists to come out of 
France. 

Daft Punk capitalizes 
on smooth beats and thick 
bass grooves, and their 
vocodered voices are a dis-
tinct part of their music. 
Sinclar flavors his music 
with some more disco-
influenced sounds. The 
French electronic sound 
also incorporates a lot of 
jazz and Brazilian influ-
ences. 

"Paris Lounge" is a 
healthy collection of 
French grooves. This rwo-
disc compilation is appro-
priately titled "Paris By 
Day" and "Paris By 
Night." 

• reviews 
l1le first disc, "Paris By 

Day," offers more relaxing 
runes. They are more jazzy 
and incorporate a live 
sound - especially in the 
drums and the basslines. 
There are a couple of tracks 
Ulat may sound a bit cheesy, 
but you can almost feel that 
French atmosphere. 

The second disc, 
"Paris By Night," is 
where the album truly 
shines. This seamless mix 
of tunes gives us an 
insight into the Parisian 
nightlife. 

Tracks by St. Germain 
and Stephane B start the 
disc with a more jazz-
influenced sound. The 
album progresses into a 
deeper groove with "A 
New Life" by Ginkgo. 
This disc closes with a 
hard-hitting techno tune 
by Harmix. 

Those who are familiar 
with the relatively smooth 
French sound wi II fi nd 
themselves playing this 
album all the time. And the 
music sounds fresh because 
this isn't some greatest hits 
collection. 

However, those who 
find a lot of Sasha or Paul 
Oakenfold albums in their 
collection and not any Air 
or B'Ob Sinclar might not 
find the same pleasure in 
this album.

Howl. 

Constant touring and 
the suffocation of their cre-
ativity worsened adverse 
effects that had already set-

tl ed into the minds of 
Cook, Mooney and Reece. 

Lupine Howl recently 
released their first full -
length, titled, "The 
Carnivorous Lunar 
Activities of Lupine 
Howl." And ulis album is 
ferocious. 

Imagine The Verve on 
uppers and a less-som ber 
Richard Ashcroft at the 
helm of the band. The 
result is wailing guitars, 
soaring atmospherics, dark 
electronics, filtered vocals 
and a modern-day psyche-
delic groove. 

The sonic appeal of 
Ltlpine Howl is most obvi-
ous on their IO-minute 
epic, "Carnival." The 
swirling drum loops, fuzzy 
guitars and lo-fi squeals 
U13t build up and break 
down make "Carnival" a 
wonderfully produced 
track. 

"The Jam That Ate 
Itself" is a powerful wall of 
sound pushing Cook's 
words front and center, 
"I'm stranded here 
between fucked and insane 
killing time 'till I gotta 
go." 

This album may not 
a ppeal to everyone bu t 
you'll find comfort in the 
sonic-high that Lupine 
Howl gives you when it's 
injected into your ears.

The Strokes to fill up 4th & B 
for their only West Coast stop 
Influence of the band and their hit single 
'Last Nite' is moving from East to West 
By DAVE BYNUM 
Staff Writer 

he Strokes will stop at 4th & B 
on Feb. 3 as part of their 
world tour, playing their only 

California date at a venue that may 
not be able to contain the buzz this 
band has created lately. 

The band is muted for its 1970s 
sound, which is nothing like any-
thing else currently going on in 
rock. Their album, "Is This It," has 
been proclaimed this year's best 
album by botll "Entertainment 
Weekly" and "New York" magazine. 
The album was also mentioned on 
numerous top 10 lists in the United 
States and was nominated for best 
international album in the United 
Kingdom at the Brit Awards. 

Despite the New York roots of 
The Strokes, their popularity 
abroad has grown faster than it has 
at home. This could be due in great 
part to their connection with the 
fashion industry. Lead singer Julian 
Casablancas is the son of the head 
of one of the world's largest model-
ing agencies. 

Dance: 
Instructors urge pupils to take 
advantage of productions 
Continued from page 8 
sionals gives students "access to pro-
fessional pay work." She also says 
that dancers she has taught make up 
at least rwo-thirds of her company. 

Of course, just because they are 
artists first doesn't mean they don't 
enjoy teaching. Rincon's favorite 
class to teach is "History of Modern 
Dance." 

"It gives a theoretical under-
standing of how modern dance was 

In the world of fashion, the wave 
of influence moves from East to 
West. This could explain why the 
band is playing only one California 
show and around 15 on the East 
Coast, not to mention the fact that 
it is playing nearly double the 
amount of shows in Europe and the 
rest of the world than it is playing 
here in me States. 

If The Strokes follow the recent 
fashion trends, they should be huge 
in the United States in about six 
months. 

It will certainly be a rare treat to 
see: The Strokes playing a venue 
the size of 4th & B. Their tremen-
dous international success ensures 
that future shows will be at larger, 
less personal venues. 

Fresh off of hit television shows 
"Saturday Night Live" and "Conan 
O'Brien," The Strokes are promot-
ing themselves to the college-age 
crowd, who they will need in order 
to move to the top of the charts. 

Unfortunately, the show at 4th & 
B will be for those of legal drinking 
age only. Look for them next year at 
a much larger venue near you. 

formed and the effect it has on 
dance today," said Rincon. 

Isaacs most enjoys teaching 
"Choreography for Dramatic Text" 
be ause it links text-based work 
with choreography. 

Both instructors feel students 
should take advantage of the many 
dance performances in San Diego. 

Isaacs performs in the Plaza 
Cafe on Feb. II, and as all college 
students love to hear, admission is 
free.

brought about this mindset. 

Football has traditionally been 
the working man 's game, the get-
down-and-dirty, in-your-face 
game, the knee-buckling, hard-hit-
ting, expletive-laden sport. It is a 
brutally simplistic contest in which 
you lace up your shoes and try to 
pound your opponent for the next 
few hours. 

So nanlrally the masses will 
identify with lesser-known teams, 
the lower-tier teams that don't havc 
free-spending owners to buy their 
way to the top of the league_ By 
rooting for these "middle-class" 
teams, the average Joe can vicari-
ously triumph over society's elite 
through his champion. 

Along with this socioeconomic

balance [between serious compe-
tition and havihg fun) because we 
have so many players," Goodman 
said_ "It depends - since we're 
getting better and better, the 
focus is shifting to more and 
more competitive, but I think the 
root of Psycaughtits is to have 
fun. " 

Guided by second-year coach 
Chris Jewell, the Psycaughtits cer-
tainly aren't lacking in dle compet-
itive department. 

"[Chris has] been playing ulti-
mate for over 20 years," 
Goodman said. "In terms of ulti-
mate, that's about as dinosaur as 
you can get." 

With II full ro ter and a Strong, 
young team, the prospects for the 

class element, is the belief, the need 
to believe in the sports/life 
metaphor. This belief has been 
prevalent in society since the dawn 
of sports, and keeps working to 
perpetuate itself. 

Before the season even sta ned, 
the Rams were picked to win the 
Super Bowl. They have the 
chance to do that Sunday. 

That this could be predicted 
doesn't setde well in the sporting 
world . Life is unpredictable, and 
sports should be too . When the 
world of sports is to the point 
when it can be predicted, it ceas-
es to become a magical world and 
instead is rclegated to the equiva-
lent of a boring board game to be 
discarded after it is played out. 

I dearly hope the Rams do n0~ 
win on Sunday, for if they do, foot-
ball and thus sports will lose its 
equalizing uncertainty. If you can 
predict a winner before the race 
even starts, then what's the point of 
the race? 

UCSD women's ultimate ream are 
looking good. 

For their next event, the 
Psycaughtits travel to Tempe, Ariz., 
for the Tempe New Year's Fest 
from Feb_ 2 to Feb. 3_ 

"!t's an open tournament, so 
it's older, more experienced peo-
ple ," Ow said. "They've been 
playing ultimate for like 15 
years." 

According to Ow, the tourna-
ment also gives the P ycaughtits a 
chance to reunite and compete 
with alumnae. 

But this tcam is trying to con-
centrate on more important 
things . 

"1 think we need to work on the 
basics: catching and throwing," 
Goodman aid. "We've got all the 
spirit we need, all the fun; we just 
need to stay focused . Keep an eye 
on what we need_ We are so fired-
up to do better, to excel, to beat 
[last year's finish), to win n~tionals 
this year."

Rivalry: 
UCSD and UC Davis 
only Division II UCS 
Continued from page 16 

But don't think of this rivalry as 
artificial - the schools are so si mi -
lar and their athletic programs are 
so competitive that it's only natural 
for UCSD adlletes to want to beat 
Davis. 

"Rivalries do develop on a 
sport-by-sport level, but if you 
look at the department level as a 
whole, it's apparent that Davis has 
become our main rival," said 
Assistant Athletic Director Ken 
Grosse_ "It's only natural, because 
they're the only other UC school 
[in the CCAA] and they have an 
outstanding program - one that 
we wish to emulate but be better 
than_" 

Davis is also starting to gun for 
UCSD. 

"We used to have a monopoly 
on the types of kids who go to UC 
schools in Division II athletics," 
said UC Davis Assistant Sports 
In formatio n Director Mark 
Hondo. "We're starting to lose a 
bunch of kids to UCSD now and 
obviously that adds something to 
the competition." 

Certain Triton teams naturally 
have a great competi tion wi th the 
Aggies. The women's tennis team's 
only loss in the CCAA last season 
came against UC Davis, but the 
Tritons are already looking for 
revenge when the Aggies visit 
UCSD on Feb. 17. 

"This year, our match lagainst 
Davis] is at home, and we think we 
have a good chance to beat them_ 
But ollr goal is to be No. 1 in the 
conference," said women's tennis 
coach Liz LaPlante. 

The women's water polo pro-
gram always targets UC Davis in 
Western Water Polo Association 
play.

My title: UCSD's Kristin Jones dribbles past a UC Davis defender last October 
during CCAA South Division-ainching game for the Tritons. 

"Every game gets us prepared 
for [riva ls) Loyola Marymount and 
Davis," senior captain Emma 
Kruditzki said. 

The most noticeable result of 
this rivalry, however, is the race 
for the Sears Directors' Cup. 
Given out annually to the school 
that does the best in every sport, 
the cup is now a major goal for the 
Tritons. 

Last year, Davis won the cup in 
the Tritons' first year at the 
Division II level, but this year's race 
is poised to go down to the wire. 
UCSD Athletic Director Earl 
Edwards thinks UCSD has a 
chance to win what many consider 
the most prestigious tide in college 
athletics_ 

"I told [the UC Davis athletic 
director] that we 're going to take 
[the cup) away from him," 
Edwards said in an earlier inter-
view. 

'' It'~ not a bit surprising how 

well UCSD has fared at th e 
Division II level at all. It's only a 
matter of time before they com-
pete in the Direc tors' Cup," 
Hondo sa id . 

This rivalry is now carrying 
over to the fans as well. When the 
UC Davis basketball team visit 
RIMAC Arena on March I , the 
Aggies should be preparcd for a 
rude reception. 

"We have some special things 
planned for the Davis game," said 
Robin Shelton, director of Triton 
Tide_ "Coming off the energy cre-
ated by Spirit Night Web. 15 
against Cal State Los Angeles] we 
hope the UCSD students come 
together agai nst Davis." 

For now, the UC Davis-UCSD 
rivalry can be classified as "brew-
ing," but it's only a matter of time 
before Aggies-Tritons meetings 
become the Division n equivalent 
of Bruins-Trojans and Blue Devils-
Tar Heels battles.

As the Super Bowl approach-
es, I find myself 
becoming more and 
more apathetic 
toward the whole 
enervating spectacle 
the National 
Football League and 
major television net-
works love to throw 
at us in lieu of an 
actual football 
game, 

Maybe it's because I' ll be 
locked in the GUOI'dia1l office on 
Super Bowl Sunday or because 
neither of the Bay Area teams even 
came close to the championship. 
Or maybe it's because tliis year's 
Super Bowl promises to be ju t 
plain boring. 

The St. Lou is Rams have all 
the personaliry and creativiry of a 
machine. Their game plan con-
sists of a Warner quick slant to 
Bruce or Holt or Faulk or one of 
their other track-star receivers, 
then outrunning the defense for a 
touchdown . Then the defense 
creates a turnover and returns it 
for a touchdown. 

Occasionally they do like to 
mix it up and instead hand the 
ball to Faulk and let him run over, 
around, through and past the 
opposing defense. 

What's perhaps the most 
depressing is that this strategy 
will most likely earn the team its 
second set of Super Bowl rings. 

The Patriots are another story. 
They definitely have character. 
They're scrappy; they play hard; 
they have two capable quarter-
backs, and they're riding an incred-
ible hot-streak after starting the 
season 5-4. They're also going to 
get killed.

and no games that fans circle on 
the schedules. 

But there is nothing wrong 
with not having a rival. Fire 
should come from within an ath-
lete or team, it shouldn't be manu-
factured. Teams should give their 
all eve.ry game. With talent and 
some luck, success will come. 
Having a hated rival often dis-
tracts a team from the task at 
hand, potentially making a squad 
look past nonrival opponents. 
Even so, rivalries make sports fun 
for players and fans. 

So that raises the question: If

rival 

UCSD were to have a rival, who 
would it be? The closest school 
to San Diego that the Tritons 
face regularly is Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. While the 
Toros have a solid athletic 
department, they are serious 
contenders only in soccer. What 
about the team with the most 
annoying traveling fans? That 
would be the Broncos of Cal Poly 
Pomona. But then again, like 
their counterparts from DH, 
they aren't up to par with the 
Tritons in many sports. 

The logical choice then goes to 
UCSD's biggest competition -

Kenrick leung/Guardian 
not only in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
but in the entire NCAA -
UCSD's siblings from the north, 
UC Davis. 

This developing rivalry could 
become a staple in California. UC 
Davis and UCSD are similar insti-
tutions, often mentioned in the 
same breath in terms of the quali-
ry of California universities. 

Most importantly, UC Davis 
and UCSD are competitive in 
nearly every sport, fostering a nat-
.ural rivalry between the two. 

See RIVALRY. Page '5 

But when they do, it won't be 
due to lack of support. Lately, I've 
been asking everyone who they're 
rooting for on Sunday. 

The majoriry of the responses 
favor New England and , when 
pressed to give reasons for that 
choice, the standard response was, 
"Because they're the underdogs ... 
you gotta root for the 'dogs, 
man."

Psycaughtits earn No.2 preseason ranking 

And this all-too-common atti-

do you have to root for the under-

When you think about it, sup-
porting a team that's picked to 
lose is sheer folly; it's hopeless 
heartbreak for sports fans just 
waiting to happen . 

Yet you can't really shake that 
feeling, that nagging itch in the 
corner of your brain whispering 
that maybe they can pull it off. 
Maybe this time it'll be different. 
Maybe this time heart and deter-
mination will finally beat over-
powering skill.

The UCSD women's ultimate 
disc team began its quest for its 
first national title last weekend 
after making it to the finals last 
year but losing to eventual cham-
pion Universiry of Georgia. 

"Our goal is to make it to 
nationals and win," said UCSD's 
senior team captain Kristina Ow. 
"1 think we have the potential to 
do the same as we did last year." 

In 200 I , the Psycaughtits, 
loaded with experienced disc vet-
erans, were ranked second in the 
nation and finished third in the 
nation. 

This year, despite losing many 
key players, the team is again 
ranked second in early unofficial 
rankings. 

"We're definitely a different 

r.b. 1: TrItOn Baseball Stadium: aa.... vs. Point Lorna. 2 p.m. 
'.1:.., UC "*' 6 p. .. 

team," Ow said. "We lost eight 
seniors, each of which were really 
important to our team." 

However, thanks to a strong 
incoming class of players, the 
UCSD team has more than 
enough talent to fill the holes 
left behind by graduating play-
ers . 

"We gained eight really athlet-
ic rookies," Ow said. "They're 
learning how to play really fast." 

Co-captain Dania Goodman 
agreed. 

"It's always good to get fresh 
blood," she said. "This new batch 
of rookies - they're so fast and 
talented. This is a really young 
team this year and we're trying to 
do even better [than last year's fin-
ish)." 

The Psycaughtits started well, 
going undefeated in their first offi-
cial tournament last weekend in 

Santa Barbara. Facing teams from 
UC Davis, Berkeley, 
Northwestern, Stanford and UC 
Santa Barbara, the only thing that 
stopped the UCSD team was the 
rain, which ended the tournament 
after the first day. 

But before the Psycaughtits 
headed home, they had picked 
up four victories, including 'a 
huge 8-7 win by the UCSD B 
team over powerhouse Stanford's 
8 team. 

"[The Santa Barbara tourna-
ment) was the first time we've 
played together as a team," Ow 
said. "Everyone played really 
well" 

The women work with the 
men's team to host the 
President's Day Tournament in 
which more than 40 teams com-
pete at UCSD. 

"Presidents Day weekend is 

our big tournament weekend," 
Ow said. "We get teams from all 
over the nation to play - every 
field on campus is packed." 

Many of the returning players 
have been competing since sum-
mer, participating on open and 
coed teams with more experienced 
competitors. 

Last summer eight current 
UCSD players competed on a 
local team that finished fifth in 
nationals and will be traveling to 
Hawaii in August for the world 
championshi ps. 

However, despite the burden 
that comes with being the second-
ranked women's ultimate disc 
team in the nation, the 
Psycaughtits aren't forgetting that 
it's a club sport. 

"We have to definitely strike a
