Building 
Projects 

By Charles Nguyen 
SENIOR STAff WRITER 

UCSO's share of the state's voter-
approved education bond has been 
dive.rted into several budgets for 
construction and development, pro-
viding robust financial backing for 
several unfinished campus projects. 

The measure, Proposition ID, 
issued a $10.4 billion bond to the 
state's universities and K -12 schools, 
of which UCSD will receive $94.5 
miUion. The funds' uses wiU range 
from simple retrofitting - such as 
the restoration of ag'd structures 
to earthquake-safe standards - to 
massive building projects. UCSD 
wiU see both kinds of construction. 

Much of the funds to be used 
on Mayer Hall will be for safety 
upgrades, including a sprinkler sys-
tem and other fire deterrents. The

After examining the medical

practices of the hospital's trans-
plant ward.

Fire Alarm Streak Traced to Snack.Food 

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN 

John Muir College freshman Walker Ryan puts popcorn into a Tioga Hall microwave, .despite 
the removal of more than 20 appliances due to microwave smoke setting off falsefire alanns. 

Microwaves recalled 
after burnt popcorn 
triggers false fire 
alarms in John Muir 
College dorm. 

By Matt L'Heureux 
A SSOCIATE N EWS EDITOR 

In addition to other miscellaneous 
housing problems that have affected 
residents of Tioga Hall in John Muir 
College this quarter, the list has now 
grown by one - a faulty setting on 
recently purchased microwaves has led 
to their recall after causing at least two 
false fire alarms in the past few weeks. 

According to Muir Resident Dean 
Pat Oanylyshyn-Adams, 20 micro-
waves have been removed from the 
building after the "popcorn" setting 
was found to be malfunctioning. When 
students used the setting and did not 
carefully monitor their popcorn, the 
machines overheated and triggered 
smoke alarms, forcing residents of the 
II-floor building to evacuate. 

Four false alarms have gone off 
in Tioga since the beginning of the 
quarter, but according to Housing 
and Dining Services Director Mark P. 
Cunningham, only two or three inci-
dents could be conclusively linked to 

the microwaves. 
The appliances we.re purchased 

during a summer remodeling effort to 
accommodate the influx of this year's 
record-size freshman class. Along with 
the renovation came newly installed 
fire alarms, which operate on a higher 
level of sensitivity than the building's 
previous alarm system. 

Although the fire alarms have been 
a source of irritation for Tioga resi-
dents, they are working properly in 
the way they were deSigned, UCSO 
Assistant Fire Marshal Donald R. 
Anderson said. 

"The system does what it's sup-
posed to do:' he said. "I don't call it a 
problem. 1 call it a problem with train-
ing students:' 

However, Anderson said that the 
sensitivity of the alarms will be adjusted 
in order to curb the number of future 
incidents, including implementing a 
new verification system which will 
require an alarm to sense smoke for 30 
consecutive seconds before going off. 

"We're not dropping the level of 
safety, were dropping the level of nui-
sance; Anderson said. 

In the city of San Diego, a fi re 
alarm permit can be revoked after 
more than two fal e alarms occur 
in a 30 day span, according to fire

Regents' Budget Awaits State Govt. Approval 
Budget proposal 
includes increased 
enrollment 
funding, employee 
salary increases. 

By Christine Au-Y tung 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

The UC Board of Regents has 
approved a 2007-08 budget propos-
al complete with increases in faculty 
compensation and reinstatement of 
funding to the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, although finalization 
remains uncertain as UC officia1s wait 
for the state government's response to 
the proposal. 

The budget plan, which the regents 
approved on Nov. 16, includes "new 
funding for student enrollment growth 
at both the undergraduate and gradu-

, ate levels, expansion of research in 
fields critical to California's competi-
tiveness, restoration of prior cuts to 
the instructional program and salary 
increases for faculty and staff," accord-
ing to the UC Office of the President. 

However, the proposal is only the 
beginning of the negotiation process 
and must first be reviewed by Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, then by the 
state Legislature before the regents 
can adopt a final budget agree-
ment, according to UCOP Executive 
Director of Strategic Communications 
Brad Hayward. 

"Everything greatly depends on 
where the governor stands with the 

budget, which we will gain a better 
understanding around January of 
2007; Hayward said 

While formulating the budget plan, 
the regents found limited and con-
strained resources the most difficult 
problem to overcome. 

"The state is currently in a chal-
lenging fiscal environment, and we 
are competing with many other state 
functions for funding," Hayward said. 
"The UC system has a lot of needs and 
still suffers from budget cuts from ear-
lier in the decade, but we constructed 
the best and most thoughtful proposal 
with given resources." 

The proposal initiates funding for 
a 2.5 percent enrollment increase - or 
5,340 full-time-equivalent students 
- which will allow the university to 
keep up with undergraduate enroll-
ment growth as well as contiDue to 
increase graduate and health sciences 
enrollments that historicaIJy bne not 
kept pace with the state's needs. 

However, because the stale has yet 
to approve the proposal, it IS c too 
soon to speculate on what the funding 
wiU apply toward; UCSD Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Admissions and 
Registration Mae W. Brown said. 

The budget plan also requests a $15 
million research initiative that would 
both partially restore recent budget 
cuts to core programs such as agri-
cultural research and funding for the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

However, Scripps. a national pow-
erhouse In oceanographic research, 
will not know how the money will 
be distributed until the final budget is

negotiated. 
"Since we do not know how much 

new funding Scripps w.ill receive, 
we cannot speculate about spend-
ing, though all at Scripps are very 
pleased that the partial restoration 
of prn'ious cuts is in the proposed 
UC budget, drawing attention to the 
vital role that Scripps plays in oceano-
graphic research for the benefit of the 
state and the citizens of California; 
Assistant Director of Communications 
at Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
Mario Aguilera said. 

Regarding faculty and staff mem-
bers, the budget includes a 5 per-
cent pool for employee compensation 
increases, including both merit- and 
equity-based salary increases, health 
and welfare benefit COlt increases and 
related increases intended to begin 
dosing the market pay gap affection 
OWl)' UC faculty and staff 

It also requests $60 million in state 
funding for the fIrst phase of reinstat-
ing employer contributions to the UC 
Retirement Plan, an issue that has 
caused an uproar among unions rep-
resenting workers at the University of 
California. 

Employer and employee contri-
butions to the UC retirement plan 
have not been required since the early 
1990s because of the performance of 
the university's investment portfolio. 
However, the regents determined that 
the plan would become underfunded 
in upcoming years unIe s contribu-
tions resume, and recently voted to 
resume contributions in July 2007. 

According to American Federation

Study: Atmospheric 
Methane levels Off 
Atmospheric methane, a com-

mon greenhouse gas, has remained 
relatively stagnant for the last seven 
yea rs fo lJowing a two-decade rise, 
s ientists at UC Irvine recently 
determined . 

The finding suggests that meth-
ane may not be as large of a 
global warming threat as previ-
ously believed. 

Instead, the study provides evi -
de n e that could make methane 
regulation possible. Researche rs 
also discovered that periods of 
increased methane in the atmo-
sphere correlated with rises in 
ethane, which is emitted dur-
ing fires. This provides addit ional 
evidence that methane is created 
when burning biomass. 

Professors F. Sherwood Rowland 
and Donald R. Blake, along with sci-
entists lsobel J. Simpson and Simone 
Meinardi , sa id that the leveling off 
of methane may be due to leak-pre-
ve nting repairs on oil and gas lines 
and storage facilities, which have 
been known to release methane. 
Other reasons may include reduced 
methane emissions from coa l min-
ing. rice paddies and natural gas 
production . 

Methane a lso co ntributes to 
the formation of smog. Since the 
1700s, the leve l of atmospheric 
methane has more than doubled . 
About two- thirds of emissions can 
be linked to human activiti es li ke 
fossil -fuel extrac tion , rice farm-
ing, landfill dumping a nd ca ttle 
raising. 

While m thane has significant 
effects, carbon dioxide - the major 

greenhouse gas emitted by burning 
fossi I fuels - is the most threaten-
ing, according to Rowland, which 
emphasizes the need to reduce ali 
gas emissions. 

UCSD Ranks High in 
Scientific Impact 

The work of UCSD researchers 
is among the most referenced in 
the United States, according to 
a new survey that ranked UCSD 
seventh in the nation for "scien-
tific impacl." 

Thomas Scientific, a company 
that publishes scholarly research 
databases, ranked universities 
whose published work between 
the years of 2001 and 2005 has 
been cited by other scientists 
more frequently than other insti-
tutions. 

UCSD ranked among the top 
lOin six of the 21 scientific fi elds 
included in the survey: clinical 
medicine, plant and animal sci-
ences, immunology, molecular 
biology and genetics, pharmaco l-
ogy and chemistry. 

The iournal Science Watch, 
an arm of Thomas Scientific that

Measure ID Will Fund New 
Engineering, Visual Arts Facility 
• PROPOSITION, from page 1 
building, built in the I 960s, will 
also update its laboratories with 
modernized equipment. 

The bulk of the proposition's 
funding, however, will go to a mul-
timillion-dollar project to construct -
a 110,000 square-foot building for 
several departments, including 
structural engineering and visual 
arts. The structure will feature art-
ist studios and hands-on labora-
tories. The university plans to use 
$75 million from Proposition 10 
for the project. 

Also. a previously underfund-
ed project to build a $50 million 
facility for the music department 
will receive $2.2 million through 
the proposition. Last month. uni-
versity officials were faced with a 
budget shortfall; rising construc-
tion costs and inflation had forced 
the building's budget up from 
the originally allotted $42 mil-
lion. Even private donations and 
reserve funding could not make 
up the difference. The proposi-
tion's funding has since closed the 
budget gap, and will be used for 
audio systems and pianos. 

The Rady School of 
Management will also benefit from 
the proposition. with a $1 million 
allocation. The o.ngoing construc-
tion project, originally conceived 
in 2001. has faced funding hurdles. 
with the university using $12.5 mil-
lion of its own funds to float the 
cost of the project. 

Although the business school 
already enrolls students, its penna-
nent facility is still in the planning 
stages. with first-stage comple-
tion slated for 2007. The money 
acquired from PropOsition 10 will 
go toward the second phase of con-
struction. which should be finished 

by 20 11. 
Also. the campus will use 

$3.2 million from the mea ure to 
upgrade the campus' chilled water 
and electrical distribution systems. 

The UC Board of Regents, 
as well as UC President Robert 
C. Dynes. endorsed the bond as 
essential legislation for California's 
public universities. some of which 
have severely outdated classrooms 
and facilities. 

"[The University ofCalifomia'sl 
role in educating the future work-
force, developing new technologies 
and keeping our state economi-
cally competitive depends upon 
I he availability of safe, modern 
facilities;' Dynes stated in a press 
release . 

More classrooms and better 
facilities will also help the universi-
ty accommodate ballooning enroll-
ment growth. Dynes stated. 

The bond will also loan $200 
million, over a two-year period. to 
improve medical education pro-
grams. Specifically, that portion of 
the funds will be used for facil -
ity and equipment enhancement 
used in the UC-wide "Programs 
in Medical Education;' which was 
established to improve healthcare 
for the state's underserved . 

"Through the expansion of 
telemedicine and other innovative 
efforts, the funding in Proposition 
10 will make a real difference for 
Californians who need better access 
to health care~ Dynes tated. 

Voters have approved two 
education bonds since 2002, 
loaning $345 million to UC 
schools over four years for simi-
lar purposes.

Student Fee 
Plan Missing

tions are a severe burden for rank-and-
me employees. 

"The university needs to wake 
up and be open with the campus 
community;' Perez said earlier thi s 
month . 

The current budget does not 
include a plan for student fees, and 
the regents will wait for the gover-
nor's Januar y state budget proposal 
before making any decision on stu-
dent fees, according ~o the press 
release. 

If student fees increase in 2007-
08, U officials intend to provide for 
33 percent of the undergraduate fee 
income to be returned to financial 
aid, with special emphasis on pro-
viding assistance to needy middle-
income students who traditionally 
have not qualified for grant aid. In 
addition. the proposal calls for a 45 
percent return -to-aid for graduate 
academic students and a 33 percen t 
return-to-aid for profeSSional school 
students. 

Though it is very likely that 
student fee increases would return 
directly to student s as financial 
aid, such a plan remains tenta -
tive until further response from 
Schwarzenegger, according to UCSD 
Director of Financial Aid Vincent 
De Anda. 

"If money is needed to keep the 
quality of education and provide 
students what they need. the money 
has to come in to achieve such goals, 
whether from the state or elsewhere," 
De Anda said. "But this aLI depends 
on what the governor wants."

BUT SO IS 

WRESTLING 
A STINGRAY 
T wenty-one seems to he a rather artificial milestone. At 18 you're old enough to join 
the army and die for your country, 
or to exercise your civic responsi-
bilities and vote. You've long been 
able to drive a motor vehicle or get 
married and produce children. You 
can even gamble in some places! It 's 
even hig'hly unlikely that your 21 Sl

birthday is the first time you've con-
sumed alcohol: The U .. Department 
of Health and Human Services esti-
mates that more than 80 percent of 
Americans d rink before they can 
legally do so. So the only real di f-
ference is that now you can buy it 
yourself. rather than mooching off 
your friends or sweating while the 
bouncer examines your fake 10. 

But the very artificiality of the 
miles tone seems to have created a 
dangerous rite of passage fo r many 
students. While nothing really 
changes, it becomes more and more 
important that the day be celebrat -
ed. It's pretty much a guarantee that 
you 're goi ng to over-drink, throw up 
and pass out, probably even several 
times throughout the night. It helps 
that oftentimes you don't have to 
even bother opening your wallet; 
friend s and strangers are ready and 
willing to help pay for your alcohol. 
But the availability of drinks and 
the pre sure to get raging drunk 
on your 21 st birthday can lead to 
unfortunate trends. 

Namely 21 for 21. 
Sometimes occurring during the 

hour after midnight on your 21st 
birthday, it makes sense: Give the 
birthday boy the same number of 
drinks as years he's been alive. It 
even makes a good chant. But the 
reality of drinking 21 drinks in such 
a short period of time is a frighten -
ing one. 

just look at David Thorton . A 
UC Davis senior who died a number 
of years ago, Thorton managed to 
accumulate a blood alcohol content 
of 0.54 in under two hours. Keep in 
mind that 0.40 is generally consid-
ered lethal, and that the legal limit 
for driving while intoxicated is 0.08 
in California. 

In typical political fashion, legis-
latures across the country are trying 
to make it more difficult for people 
to drink on their 21st birthday in 
order to reduce the amount of binge 
drinking that occurs. Minnesota, 
Texas, North Dakota and several 
other states have tried to enact laws 
that would make it illegal to buy 
alcohol until 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. on the 
day you turn 21. Of course, many 
are skepticaL of the plan's effective -
ness. 

"I can't imagine that it would 
make one bit of difference," said 
Charles Roper, coordinator of alco-
hol and drug education at University 
Health Services at the University of 
Texas. He pointed out that if people 
can' t celebrate at midnight on their 
birthday, they'll simply celebrate the 
next evening.

OPINION 

L et's face it - not a single din-ing hall on campus will ever compare to mom's home-
cooked chili. At one point or anoth-
er, students realize that dining-hall 
food will never sat isfy everyone. 
So why, then, is purchasing meal 
points mandatory for students liv-
ing on campus? 

Although the food is generally 
bearable, and the system allows stu-
dents freedom to eat what they 
want when they want, the dining 
dollars system leaves much to be 
desired. 

All students living on campus 
are required to purchase 1,800 meal 
points, regardless of how much or 
how little they eat. This means that 
before the school year even begins, 
Housing and Dining Services takes 
in a whopping $1 ,800 from each 
student living on campus. And with 
the money already in their pock-
ets, is there really any incentive for

son to provide students with desir-
able prices or quality. And it shows. 

Why on earth is a container of 
10 pineapple slices $2.75 at a din-
ing hall, when a quarter mile down 
the street you can buy an entire 
pineapple for that price, and still 
have change left over? A Starbucks 
frappuccino is $2, while most stores 
charge less that $1 .50 for the same 
drink. A 12-ounce cup of hot coffee 
is $1.25, and most deli sandwiches 
are over $5. Price Center's Subway 
has a much tastier daily special, 
which is only $2.79. Although a 
dollar here and there may seem 
insignificant, added up throughout 
a typical student's two-year stay on 
campus, the difference is huge. 

The higher prices wouldn't be so 
bad if the food was worth that extra 
buck. But when a dining hall must 
prepare food for thousands of stu-
dents every day, it's unlikely that the 
food will really be restaurant qual-
ity. Sure, a $5 deli sandwich is worth 
it when it is loaded with gourmet 
turkey breast, fresh tomatoes and 
vegetables and fresh soft bread. But 
packaged Butterball turkey breasts 
that were bulk-ordered in packs 
of 10,000 on Wonderbread is not 
worth the money. Satisfactory? Yes. 

While dining dollars are 
meant to be flexible, 
students are locked 

into a system with 
limited accountability. 

By Melody Gaal

But worth the cost? No. Yet students 
are required to spend that money, 
when they may not want to. 

And this prevents the students 
who live in apartments with full 
kitchens from buying and prepar-
ing their own food. Because they 
have the meal points, they surely 
wouldn't want to waste them. So 
they must settle for overpriced, not-
as-tasty options. 

Students should have the free -
dom to purchase as many or as few 
meal points as they want. Some 
students refuse to eat the food, go 
grocery shopping and make their 
own meals, while others eat three 
times a day in the dining hall. Some 
students starve under the 1,800 
meal point plan·, while others throw 
money away. To really cater to the 
majority of students, meal plans 
should be much more flexible. 

Of course, we must always be 
thankful for what Housing and 
Dining Services does have to offer. 
UC Santa Barbara students can only 
swipe their dining card twice a day, 
forcing students to eat when they 
may not be hungry, and not eat 
when they are. UCSD has a plan 
that caters much more to the indi-
vidual student's lifestyle, and causes 

students to only take what they 
need, rather than scarfmg down 
as much as they can because it is 
the only chance they will get to eat 
that day. 

But a fix for UCSD's din -
ing services is really quite simple 
- eliminate dining dollars and 
make Triton Plus debit accounts the 
standard. Parents would be able to 
deposit money according to the 
particular needs of their students. 
TritonPlus dollars can be spent 
in dining halls and at several off-
campus restaurants - and best of 
all, money deposited in TritonPlus 
accounts is fully refundable. If the 
dining halls had to compete for our 
money like every other store and 
restaurant, we'd likely see a marked 
improvement in prices and quality 
offood. 

According to the H&DS Web 
site, "The dining plan was created 
to give everyone maximum flex-
ibility." But where's the flexibility 
in a system that forces students to 
buy a set amount of nonrefundable 
meal points that can only be spent 
in a handful oflocations? Tfthe best 
interest of students is what H&DS 
has in mind, there's a simple way to 
show it: Get rid of dining dollars. 

Democrats Get a Shot at Higher Ed Reform in 2007 
The Higher Education

With a series of victories in

Drug Task Force Targets Smoke Shops Instead of Problem 
By Daniel Nguyen 

STAFF WRITER 

In EI Cajon, Calif., once known 
as the "methamphetamine capital of 
the world ," smoke shop owners have 
recently been pestered by police 
about selling glass pipes. Selling 
pipes in a smoke shop, who would 
have thought? 

Deputy District Attorney 
jennifer Gianera, a member of the 
Methamphetamine Strike Force 
- which is charged with fighting 
methamphetamine use and distri -
bution in San Diego county - told 
the San Diego Union-Tribune that 
smoke shop owners will now be 
held accountable for selling items 
that could be used to smoke illegal 
substances. 

If that's the case, the ci ty 's 
Methamphetamine Strike - Force 
might as well start confiscating 
pens from Staples, which are much 
cheaper than glass pipes and work 
just as well. Or maybe law enforce-
ment could tackle underage binge 
drinking by seizing shot glasses. 

It 's ridiculous to confiscate glass 
pipes simply beca!lse there's a possi-
bility that people could use them to 
smoke methamphetamine. 

Ironically, Gianera also told the 
Union-Tribune that other devices 
that could possibly be used to smoke 
marijuana were not confiscated. Is 
methamphetamine Big Brother's 
target drug of the month? If the San 
Diego Strike Force wants to wage a 
war on drugs, at least wage a war on 
all drugs instead of seemingly focus-
ing on one drug over the other. 

Sure, the intent of the 
Methamphetamine Strike Force is 
good - but so arc the smoke shop 
owners' intents. Up In Smoke store 
manager Donovan Small told the 
Union- Tribune that it's not his job to 
monitor what his customers do with 

his products once they leave the 
store. Managers say that their smoke 
shops are legitimate busine ses and 
all their products are meant for use 
with legal products such as tobacco; 
the glass pipes are designed to filter 
tobacco. 

Pens are meant for writing, 
but could be used to smoke meth-
amphetamine. In fact , Joe Nolley, 
member of Shelbyville, Ind., police 
department's narcotics division, said 
on the department's Web site that a 
good way to see if someone is smok-
ing methamphetamine is to look for 
empty pen cartridges. If this is the 

San Diego really 
wants to fight 

methamphetamine 
use, then it should 

pursue more effective 
measures instead of 
taking pipes off the 

shelves?' 
case, shouldn't the Strike Force do 
something about pens as well? 

After ail, even though pens were 
designed to be benign, they have the 
possibility of functioning in an ille-
gal way. Methods of methamphet-
amine u e are almost limitless, and 
it's futile to fight the drug war by 
attacking the methods themselves. 
The problem is not how meth users 
are using the drug, but rather that 
they are able to obtain the drug in 
the first place. It would be more 
effective to concentrate on hitting 
them where it hurts by curtailing 
the actual production or availability 

of methamphetamine, or increasing · ers, instead of outright confiscating addiction. In addition, only 39 pcr-

grams. should pursure more effective mea- ously something flawed about the 

Small also said that the confisca- sures instead of taking pipes off drug rehabil itation program and 
tion raid only takes money from 
smoke shops and is highly skeptical 
that simply taking away glass pipes 
will deter methamphetamine users. 
Smoke shops are already placed 
under plenty of regulations, includ -
ing zoning restrictions. Confiscating 
shop items because they can be used 
for illicit purposes is really overkill. 

What matters mo t is that smoke 
shop owners aren't promoting drug 
use. In fact, they're against drug 
use as much as anyone else. Puff 'N 
S\uff smoke shop in EI Cajon has 
signs and policies indicating that if 
a customer shows any sign of illegal 
intent, the shop will refuse to sell 
to that customer. Owner are con-
sciously aware of the fact that their 
products could be used illegally and 
are taking steps to prevent it as 
much as they can. They don't need 
law enforcement to forcefully take 
away products that can possibly be 
harmful. 

Small also told the Union -Tribune 
that he doesn't think that removing 
glass pipes will necessarily stop 
methamphetamine users. And it 
won't. There are too many other 
alternatives to glass pipes, such as 
using light bulbs, or even snort-
ing or injecting methamphetamine 
instead of smoking it. 

San Diego's East County law 
enforcement has already given retail 
outlets and pharmacies brochures 
informing them about possible 
products that could be used to make 
methamphetamine, so that owners 
are aware and can better monitor 
suspicious purchases. Law enforce-
ment should have done the same 
thing with the smoke shop own-

of the shelves of smoke shops and that a key step in fighting the war 
heckling shop owners abput selling on methamphetamine should be to 
potentially dangerou items. invest in improving the success rates

Med Center to Be Reviewed Next Year 
~ HOSPITAL, from page 1 
process that occurs every three 
years. The UCSD Medical Center 
received a chart review audit, dur-
ing which UN OS discovered several 
problems including incorrect blood-
type documentation for five liver 
transplant patients. In the five cases, 
the charts incorrectJy indicated that 
the liver donor and recipient shared 
the same blood type. 

However, according to UCSD 
Chief Medical Officer Angela 
Sciascia, the mismatched blood 
types did not result from a clinical 
error. 

"While we agree with the find-
ing that the information was not 
correctly entered in the record, the 
clinical decision that these patients 
would receive an organ of any blood 
type due to the severity of their con-
dition was the correct one," Scioscia 
stated in an internal memo. 

The patients were diagnosed 
with fulminant , or end-stage, liver 
disease, which requires a liver 
transplant if the patient were to 
survive beyond a few hours. At 
this stage, it is common practice 
to transplant whatever organ is 
available regardless of blood 
type, according to Andrew Aussi, 
the transplant director at UCSD 
Medical Center. 

The liver transplant patients 
mentioned in the UN OS review 
were terminally ill patients who 
would have died in a few hours if 
untreated, he said, and the practice 
of organ transplants in this situ-
ation is a "widely known but less 
favorable treatment." 

UNOS also found that some 
data entered by medical center 
officials did not match patients' 
medical records, which could have 
skewed the representations of 
transplant candidates' conditions, 
since the severity of a patient's con-
dition dictates his or her prospects 

for a transplant. 
Aussi said that UNOS did not 

find any specific problems with clin-
ical issues, but did not elaborate on 
the other issues raised in the review. 

"Most of the issues that were 
brought up were clerIcal issues or 
resulted from clerical issues," he 
said. 

The number of problems found 
in the program led to probation 
in July 2006, but the penalty was 
rescinded after the medical cen-
ter presented UNOS with a list of 
changes that it was willing to make. 
UNOS has now placed the hospital's

transplant program on "probation 
in abeyance; according to Scioscia's 
memo . 

The actions carried out by the 
UNOS review board were "meant as 
measures to warn us to strengthen 
UCSD's clerical and [ecord-keep-
ing processes," said Leslie Franz, 
UCSD Medical Center's chief 
director of health science commu-
nications and public affairs. 

In addition, the UNOS audit 
found "no issues that were out-
lined that would have negatively 
impacted patient care; Aussi said, 
which has been the source of much 
speculation after the findings ini-
tially surfaced. 

Franz said that the program was 
"committed to patient care" but was 

also in a constant tate of improve-
ment in order to keep up with regu-
lations. 

UNO spoke woman Annie 
Moore was unable to comment on 
individual cases. While the find -
ings would be kept confidential, 
public disclosure occurs after a 
member of UNOS is either put on 
probation - as the center was in 
July - or is found to "not be in 
good standing;' Moore stated in 
an e-mail. 

For the time being, the medi-
cal center's transplant program will 
continue to run without additional 
interference by UNOS, although 
Aussi said he is not sure if UNOS 
will reconsider probatlon. 

"I cannot say that they have 
completely let go of the idea; Aussi 
said. 

However, he said he is confi -
dent that the hospital has made 
the necessary changes to satisfy 
UNOS policy in the wake of the 
recent review. He also said that 
any upcoming review or action by 
the panel will be based on future 
performance. 

The medical center's changes 
include bolstering the numbers of 
its pre- and post-transplant staff, 
Aussi said. In order to satisfy 
UNOS policies, additional coor-
dinators have also been hired to 
handle data needs that had previ -
ously fallen short. Other changes 
include notifying patients of their 
wait list status by mail within 10 
days regardless of whether the 
patient was in the hospital or not, 
as some records had shown that 
transplant patients were unaware 
of their status. 

UCSD Medical Center wiU be 
reviewed again by UNOS early 
next year.

New Minor Aims to Contribute to Campus Diversity 
Thurgood Marshall 
College kicks off its 
African American 
studies minor to 
benefit campus 
community life. 

By Megan Durham 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Historically, studenls have always 
complained about the lack of cultural 
diversityatUC D. TheUndergraduate 
Student Experience and Satisfaction 
Committee explained last year that 
that one of the major faults students 
found with the campus was that they 
felt "a need for a richer and more var-
ied cultural life:' while The MQ often 
runs satirical articles with titles like 
"Black Student Tired of Posing for 
UCSD Publicity Photos:' And the fact 
is, aside from a large Asian popula-
tion that is projected to become the 
majority very soon, the student body 
at UCSD is rather homogenous. 

Problems with diversity on cam-
pus tend to get their share of atten-
tion from the campus administration, 
since many prospective students con-
sider diversity to be one of the most 
important attributes of a good col-
lege. Thurgood Marshall College has 
just begun a new African American 
studies minor in hopes that it will 
eventually grow, just like the dance 
and ethnic studies majors, into a via-
ble major and department. 

"It's like a seedling;' said Allan 
Havis, the new Thurgood Marshall 
provost. "We just need to give it the 
chance to grow." 

According to a UCSD press 
release, the new minor is "an 
outgrowth of the longstanding 
and successful minor program, 
Contemporary Black Arts." The new 

minor includes some characteristics 
of the old, but has been expanding 
to transcend the previous narrow 
focus on the arts. Students pursuing 
an African American studies minor 
will now take courses in the history 
and context of the black experience, 
as well as courses about politicS, 
society and the representation and 
voice of the culture. 

Of course, one aspect of the 
minor, according to Havis, is that 
"as it becomes more visible, it will 
attract more African American stu-
dents, faculty and members of the 
community." 

But he is quick to note that this 
is not a "ghetto program," nor was 

it ever intended to be 
one. The belief is that 
this minor will not solely be 
made up of black students, 
but rather help add to the prestige 
of a UCSD degree. It could be ben -
eficial for quite a few students on 
their way to law or medical schools, 
Havis said, to show that Ihey care 
about cultural diversity, not to men-
lion add to the marketability of any 
number of other majors. 

But perhaps the most interesting 
aspect is the minor's is the cultural

component. Already, the fledgling 
minor is responsible for organiz-
ing events bringing the Urban Bush 
Women and Juan Williams to the 
UCSD campus. Not only is the minor 
intended to improve the cultural life 
on campus, but it is also intended 
to plsy a part in convincing students 
to stay on campus long after classes 

are over. 

"[ would love for UCSD to become 
a 24/7 campus," Havis said . He said he 
wants the minor to help bring atten-
tion to events on campu s and re-edu -
cate people to stay nearby, thus work-
ing toward building a more viable 
social life on what is traditionally a 
commuter campus.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Club Casts Itself into Medieval History 
~ SCA, from page 8 
anything from the fall of the Roman 
Empire to the 1600s. The SCA's cul-
tural subject matter also spans sepa-
rate groups that are dedicated to 
Cehic and Norse recreation even 
within the College of St. Artemas. 
Though the society's focus is most-
1y European, members nationwide 
have also dedicated themselves to 
medieval Japane e and Chinese cul-
tures. among others. 

The College of St. Artemas at 
UCSD is technically quite small, con-
sisting of about 12 student members. 
However. UCSD graduates continue 
to be involved long after they offi -
dally leave the university. bringing 
the number of active participants up 
to around 25, according to Jarleborn. 
The dub does what it can to promote 
itself during Welcome Week al the 
university. including staging sparring 
matches, showcaSing costumes and 
handing out fiiers from Muir Quad 
to Sixth College. 

"We don't care if we're laughed at, 
if it gets a few more people to join;' 
Jarleborn said . To fundraise, mem-

bers also hold bake sales, sell cloth-
ing through an online store called 
CafePress and sponsored a screen-
ing of "T he Princess Bride" at Price 
Center Theater. 

Jarleborn, who has been involved 
in the university's chapter since she 
was a freshman. has been sene-
schal since April, at which point the 
incumbent was killed by a Rodent 
of Unusual Size - or stepped down. 
according to the college's Web sile, 
which lists a colorful imaginary 
death for each of its previous lead-
ers. Others have an SCA history 
much longer than this; club exche-
quer, or treasurer. Daniel Everson 
(also known as Eirikr Iversson) has 
parents who were members of the 
SCA during their own college years. 

" 11's a great way to learn about 
medieval culture and to experience 
the upsides of it ;' Jarleborn said 
when asked to sum up her fascina -
tion with the SCA. "Experience" is 
certainly a fitting word; SCA mem -
bers tryout things on the field that 
are normally restrained to histori -
ans· speculations, from armor con -

struClion to combat styles. 
"You have to understand that the 

art of nonrapier sword fighting Qjls 
pretty much been lost, and so we've 
been wandering around in the dark. 
rediscovering things; Everson said. 
referring to the SCA's extensive study 
and practice of medieval combat. "A 
lot of Iwbat has been] found in the 
newly discovered fighting manuals or 
manuscripts actuaUy details some of 
the stuff we've done or reinvented. Or 
when it's something we haven't done, 
somebody immediately goes out and 
tries it:' 

T he fun of the dub is in how 
they discover what works and what 
doesn't . A point of etiquette or battle 
maneuver might be someone's flight 
of fancy or might have actually been 
used by a knight locked in deadly 
combat or a lady writing a letter 
to her fiance. More than anything. 
the members of UCSD's College of 
St. Artemas have a whole lot of 
fun doing it - and at each of their 
events, at least for a little while. his-
tory becomes more than just things 
people used to do.

Casellini and Lackey Earn WWP A Honors 
• WWPA, from page 16 

All year long, the Tritons played 
in close games, learning how to win 
late. They had 11 games decided by 
a single goal, losing only two, with 
one of them to the undefeated No. I 
USC team. 

"We all wait for these defining 
moments - who's going to come 
through as heroes and who will crack 
unde r the pressure:' UCSD head 
coach Denny Harper said. "This team . 
has come through all year:' 

On Nov. 17 and Nov. IB, UCSD 
easily defeated UC Santa Cruz, 13-9, 
and Santa Clara University, 13-8, to 
se t up the fourth and final meet-
i ng between I he top two teams in 
the WWPA on Nov. 19 in front of 
a packed house at Pomona-Pitzer 
Colleges. 

The Triton came out strong and 
took a 3-1 lead ea rly in the first half. 
It was followed by a 4-0 run by the 
Lions to put them up by two goals, 
5-3. UCSD got back to playing better 
defense and was able to tie by the end 
of the half. 

"There was no quit in those guys 
and they pushed us possibly beyond 
where we thought we ·had to go:' 
Harper said. 

With only three and a half minutes 
left in the game, the Tritons took a 
9-6 lead, despite failing to score in six 
chances with a man advantage. 

"We've done this before where we 
have a lead on them and it's almost 
like we get comfortable with it men-
tally:' senior goalkeeper Jeremy 
Randall said. "You've got to give credit 
to LMU; they didn't want to give up, 
they didn't roll over." 

The Lions fought back to tie 
the game at nine apiece, setting up 
the eventual game-winning shot by 
Dordoni. 

"We ran multiple set plays suc-
cessfully, but in this particular case, 
something told me they needed to 
just go down and play:' Harper said. 
"In hindsight, I was right. It was an 
awesome shot that [DordoniJ had." 

Loyola Marymount didn't get 
a chance to tie the game again as 
U SD stole the ball and junior utility 
A.J. Kotanjian drew an ejection. The 
Tritons were then able to run out the 
clock for the victory. 

At the end of the tournament, 
Casellini was named WWPA Most 

SAN H LUONG/GUARD/AN 
The WWPA title was the 14th for the Tritons, pushing their record to 25-5 overall and sending 
them illto the natiollal semifinals 011 Dec. 2 at Loyola Marymount Uniuersity. 
Valuable Player, while also being 
named to th e WWPA First Team 
along with teammate senior two-
meter offense 1'y Lackey. 

Kotanjian made the aLl -WWPA 
Second Team -and junior driver 
Adnan Jerkovic received an honor-
able mention. 

"I was surprised that I won the 
award and ILackey) didn't;' CaseUini 
said. "Honestly, I didn't even think I 
was going to be on the First Team, but 
I really appreciate it~ 

Their goal of winning the WWPA 
has been accomplished, and all that's 
left for the fifth-ranked Tritons is the 
national championship. 

"We're going to probably be play-

ing better because we're relaxed:' 
Randall said. "The pressure is off of 
us and it's on everyone else. We're not 
expected to win:' 

This tearn has exceeded expecta-
tions throughout Ihe season and has 
proved that it is one of the best teams 
in the country. With the team's con-
fidence at its highest, UCSD has the 
opportunity to make some big noise 
in the upcoming tournament. 

"Everyone on our team knows we 
can play against anyone;' Casellini 
said. "It's almosl better that we're 
underdogs. We have nothing to lose."

Four Players Notch Double-Digit Kills 
• VOLLEYBALL, from page 1 6 
Tritons as the Bulldogs handed UCSD 
its third and loughest loss in a series 
of four games, 30-32, 26-30, 30-28, 
20-30. 

"We needed to bring our 'A' game 
and we didn't:' Courtney said. "We 
planned to take them down with 
our erve and we just had 100 many 
errors:' 

Ln game one, the Tritons trailed 12-
6 early and used both timeouts. They 
then rallied 10 pull within 16-13 and 
eventually tied the ganle 20-20. Junior 
outside hitter Rebecca Bailey sent down 
a kill giving UCSD the lead 21-20. 

The Bulldogs fought off four Triton 
game points to tie the game 30-30 and 
went on to win 32-30. 

"We were playing pretty well and 
we just needed to side out once:' Black 
said. "There was the hitting error that 
gave Dulut~, momentum. It was just 
unfortunate. 

Both teams battled back and forth 
for the first haif of game two before 
the Bulldogs broke open a five-point 
lead 16-11. The Tritons stormed back, 
cutting the lead to just one, 24-23, 
on a block by senior setter Kristen 
Halvorsen and freshman middle 
blocker Sylvia Schmidt. 

The Bulldogs closed the game on a 
6-3 run giving them the 30-26 win as 
well as a two-game advantage. 

"We've been down two games 
before:' Bailey said . "We just tried to 
put the two games behind us and play 
every gan1e separately, but it's a differ-
ent thing at nationals:' 

Trailing early in game three, UCSD 
tied the game at 13-13 on a Bulldog 
attack error. Senior middle blocker 

ARASH KESHMIRIAN / GUARDIAN FILE 
Senior setter Kristin Ha/oorsen tallied 1,060 assi$/s on the season to help the Tritons 
earn an impressiue 26-3 oueroll record, which ended with their defeat to the Bulldogs. 
Brianna Koche put the Tritons up 14-
13 with one of her 16 kills on the 
match. 

The teams then traded points until 
University of Minnesota Duluth was 
able to score consecutive points and 
take a 25-23 advantage. UCSD then 
tied the game at 27-27 on another 
Koche kill . A fter a Bulldog service 
error and a Koche kill, the Tritons had 
taken game three 30-28. 

UCSD trailed early again in game 
four but took the lead 8-7 on junior 
opposite Amber Ries' kill. University 
of Minnesota Duluth would regain the 
lead and stretch it to 19-15. 

The Tritons only got as dose as :zo.. 
17 the rest of the game in the ..-on-
ending 30-20 lou. 

"I think we got tentative and ner-
vous at the end of that game," Courtney 
said. "We weren't playing aggressively, 
and that's when you make errors:' 

UCSD finished the game with dou-
ble-digit kills from four players, with 
Ries' 19 leading the way. Courtney 
added 13 kills to make her season 
total 351. 

With the loss of four seniors, all of 
whom were regular starters, it's now 
the underclas men at the helm. 

"We worked really hard and played 
more efficiently than any other in the 
league this year," Black said. "[The 
undcrc:I8Iemen) are already training for 
next year and now that they've made it 
to the Elite Eight, they're expecting to 
be there again:' 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Fair-Weather Fans Abundant in San Diego 
• BANDWAGON, from page 16 
move was to sign up for San Diego 
Chargers season tickets. This was 
not turning my back on the Niners, 
whom r still root for, but simply 
elevating what had until then been 
a secondary team (a squad's scores 
you check, watch some games when 
convenient and hope they do well, 
but still root lIgainst when they play 
your favorite) to a higher level of 
fandemonium . 

However, J divide myself from 
those San Diegans who have just 
realized that Tomlinson is their 
favorite player after watching him 
run to the end zone like it wlls 
Black Friday and all Matthew 
McConaughey DVDs are going for 
three for $10. 

I bought my tickets in early 
2004, after the Chargers had fm-
ished a horrible 4- 12 season and 
Eli Manning announced that he did 
not want to be the No. I overall 
selection if it meant playing in San 
Diego. It's hard to blame Manning 
if you listened to sports radio and 
TV shows during that time, with 
more than one "expert" declaring 
that the Chargers had a real chance 
to become the first NFL team to fin -
ish a season at 0-16. 

The Chargers went on to finish 

12-4, get a playoff home game and 
prove everybody wrong - even that 
college student who bought tickets 
on a whim and expected to suffer 
through a few years of losing before 
a playoff season. 

Does buying those tickets make 
me Miss Cleo? No, though I did like 
"Cool Runnings." 11 simply means 

. was ... simply 
evating what had 

until then been a 
secondary team to 
a higher level of 
fand ." emoruum. 

that while most of San Diego became 
Charger fans after they proved to 
be no joke, demanded that -kicker 
Nate Kaeding be cut after missing a 
potential game-winner against the 
Jets in the playoffs and then insisted 
that quarterback Drew Brees not 
be let go after seeing him lead the 
squad to back-to-back winning sea -
sons, I was there when the first win 

was supposed to be the last, when 
Kaeding was hitting 80 percent of 
his attempts, including 8-of- 11 from 
beyond 40 and when- Brees came out 
on the field at Qualcomm Stadium 
to a thunderous round of boos dur-
ing the preseason. 

It doesn't completely infuriate 
me to see all the new throngs of 
Chargers fans with those beautiful 
powder blue jerseys. Not as much 
as all those Dallas Cowboys fans 
who had to be tolerated in the mid-
1990s, or that short-lived wave of 
Favre-natics and then, of course, the 
thousands of transplanted Colorado 
fans who just happened to find their 
old John Elway jerseys after the 
Denver Broncos won back -to-back. 

And it's. definitely not on the 
same level as the Anaheim Angels 
"fans" who celebrated in 2002, but 
couldn't tell you who Chili Davis or 
Chuck Finley were, or how every-
body seemed to have a connection 
to the Boston Red Sox when they 
finally broke the curse in 2004. 

1 guess the only real justice for 
bandwagon fans is that while they 
might crash the victory party, they 
never experienced the losing, taunt-
ing and shame that make watching 
your team's success as fulfilling as 
turkey on Thanksgiving Day. 

Women's Ultimate Drops Three to Foes 
• ULTIMATE, from page 16 
Team Navajo. Each team featured 
an equal mix of savvy veterans and 
hungry rookies that allowed all 
members to develop vital chem-
istry. 

The first day of the tournament 
produced modest results for all 
three men's teams. Team Octopus 
played four matches, finishing with 
a record of 2-2. In the first match , it 
lost to eventual tournament cham-
pion UCLA 6-13. It followed the 
loss with two straight wins against 
Cal State Long Beach and University 
of Arizona, by scores of 13-9 and 
13-6, respectively. 

Team Octopu~ fmished the day 
with a heartbreaking 10 s to UC 
Santa Barbara by a score of 11 - 12. 
The match was all tied up, and due 
to nightfall, the next point would 
secure the victory. Team Octopu s 
appeared to have made a solid 
defensive play to force a turnover, 
but UC Santa Barbara called a con-
troversial foul on Team Octopus 
that led to the winning score. 

"We thought it was a bad call," 
Elliott said. "But it was a good expe-
rience for the younger guys to play 
in a closely contested match for the 
first time." 

Mortal Kombat also finished 
the first day of competition with 
a record of 2-2. The day staned 
out with a loss to University of 
San Diego 7-13. Howeve.r, the team 
rebounded and beat Occidental 
College 13-8 and regional rival 
UC Santa Barbara 13-12. The win 
against UC Santa Barbara featured -
a ferocious comeback as UCSD ral -
lied from a 10-12 deficlt for the win. 
Mortal Kombat finished the day 
with a win against Cal State Long 
Beach by a score of 11-10. 

Senior Squids captain Quinn 
Kennett said that his team learned 
a lot from tournament play. 

"There is only one spot in 
nationals from our region this year 
and we were able to get our first 
look at some of the competition that 
we will be up against," Kennett said. 
"We need to work on our defense 
and fundamentals, but 1 thought we 
played very well overall." 

Team Navajo did not quite play 
up to par on the first day and fin -
ished with a record of 1-3. The 
day began with a pair of losses, as 
the team fell to Northern Arizona 
University 10- 13 and Claremont 
McKenna College 7- 13. Team 
Navajo followed the losses with its 
lone win of the day, narrowly beat-
ing UC Irvine 13-12. The team fin-
ished the day with a loss to UC 
Santa Barbara 8-13.

'l1re UCSD Ultimate- Warmup Tournament 011 Nov. 18 and Nou. 19 offered game 
experienoejor the young 7htons, with the women's squad winning two offiue matches. 

"r was disappointed . with the 
results for Team Navajo~ senior cap-
tain Robert Langsner said. "I thought 
we should have been in the diampi-
onship bracket, but we all played hard 
and the new guys' looked surprisingly 
comfortable out there." 

Although all three men's teams 
were eliminated from the cham-
pionship bracket during the first 
day of competition, Elliott said that 
everyone took a step in the right 
direction. 

"The tournament allowed the 
veteran players to get to know the 
young guys a lot better," Elliott said. 
"A lot of the younger guys are very 
athletic and got to practice making 
their cuts and going deep for hucks 
from the older guys:' 

Kennett was thoroughly 
impressed with the freshmen on the 
squad, and believes that they will be 
key as the Air Squids look to replace 
some valuable players this season. 

"The fresh men played fantastic the 
entire tournament and were getting 
noticed by a lot of people." Ken nett 
!laid. "After th is tournament you can 
really tell that they have become true 
ultimate Frisbee players:' 

The women's ultimate Frisbee 
team is also looking to develop 
its influx of young talent for the 

upcoming season. The team started 
the tournament well, beating UC 
Irvine 15-5 and Claremont McKenna 
College 15-7. Unfortunately, the 
winning streak stopped there as 
UCSD was handed two consecutive 
losses by the University of Southern 
California and UCLA. On Sunday, 
UCSD looked to fmd its winning 
ways again, but fell to University of 
Arizona 9-13. 

Just like its male counterpart, 
the women's ultimate team used 
this warmup tournament as a way 
to get its newcomers plenty of game 
experience. 

"We had a lot of rookies on the 
field at the same time," senior Goldy 
Thach said. "We wanted them to 
find out what ultimate was going 
to be like." 

Thach said that there is a lot of 
room for improvement before the 
beginning of the regular season_ 

"We definitely need to work on 
our deep throwing game," Thach 
said. "We use short passes a little bit 
too often; we just need to give the 
deep throws a try." 

The men's and women's teams 
will have a while to polish their 
skills, as their next matches are on 
Jan. 27 and Jan. 28 at the annual 
Santa Barbara Invite.

Thanksgiving and football seem to go together well, and with an extra holiday FL 
game airing this year, there was 
another opportunity to watch, dis -
cuss and at least pretend you know 
what you're talking about. There's 
no in in faking football knowledge, 
be it to impress a parent , boyfriend 
or crazy aunt who shows up wear-

ing his or her team's face and body 
paint, or even just to enter into a 
conversation and make sure people 
remember that you're still there and 
that you're still interesting. This is a 
natural occurrence, much like tur-
key making you sleepy (damn you , 
tryptophan! ) or your neighbors say-
ing something slightly ant i-Semitic 
and thus making the rest of the 
meal a bit awkward. 

However, a great s in of foot -
ball - and sport ove rall - does 
exist and has becom e particularly 
problematic here in San Diego. Th e 
is ue, of course, is bandwagon fans. 

They're everywhere. They wear 
jerseys with the names of the San 
Diego Chargers all -world running 
back LaDainian Tom linson and sec-
ond-year defensive tud/supplement 
user Shawne Merriman . They put 
those license plate covers on their 
cars and hang flags out of windows. 
They complain about head coach 
Marty Schottenheimer, then they 
praise him and then they complain 
about him a little more. They are 
without a doubt the most sinisterly 
evil spawns of Satan ever to ooze 
their way onto the earth's surface. 

That might be a little much, but 
then again, but so are the band-
wagon fans . The term itself prob-
ably needs more of a definition 
- these are people who become 
fans of a particular team when said 
team becomes exciting and/or com-
petitive. 

Of course, there are some distinc-
tions to be made. Becoming a fan of a 
team because of a particular favorite 
player is not bandwagoning. 

In the '90s, 50 percent of the 
country were Bulls fa ns, but that's 
because Michael Jordan's appeal was 
just too great to ignore. Liking the 
way point guard Chris Paul played 
in college and then becoming a 
Hornets fan when he's drafted is 
no crime. (Liking the way Darko 
Milicic played overseas and then 
becoming a Pistons fan is.) 

Furthermore, being a newly 
minted Chargers fan a a result of 
recently moving to San Diego also 
earns bandwagon immunity as a fan 
of geographic convenience. 

In the interest of full disclosure, 
I grew up as a San Francisco 4gers 
fan , and I told a large Chargers con-
tingent in elementary chool just 
how badly Steve Young was going 
to torch the secondary and that 
then -Chargers quarterback Stan 
Humphries couldn't hold his jock. 
This earned me a beating nearly 
equal to the 49-26 thumping the 
Niners administered, but on Super 
Bowl Sunday 1995, it was all worth 
it .

attend UCSD, my first postdecision

Matchup 
By Bratt Westcott 

STAFF WRITER 

The men's and women's ultimate 
Frisbee teams looked to start their sea-
sons off with a bang during at UCSD's 
Ultimate Warmup Tournament on 
Nov. 18 and Nov. 19. This may have 
only been a preseason tournament, 
but the competition was fierce as 
each team looked to make an early 
statement. 

The UCSD men's team, the Air 
Squids, looked at this tournament as 
an opportunity to get its surplus of 
freshmen some valuable playing time 
and game experience. 

"We have over 50 rookies this year, 
which is more than most teams have 
on their entire roster, so we wanted 
to make sure they all got a chance to 
playa lot:' senior Jeff Elliott said. "We 
lost 11 guys from our '1\ squad last 
year, so a lot of new guys are going 
to have to step it up if we want to be 
successful." 

With such a large line-up, the Air 
Squids were forced to break into three 
separate teams for the tournament: 
Team Octopus, Mortal Kombat and

winner from the loser. But this time, 
the takes were raised, as one point 
separated the Western Water Polo 
As oeialion champion from the run-
ner-up. 

The game was tied, and the 
Tritons had the ball with only a cou-
ple of minutes left to play. The shot 
clock was winding down as junior 
driver Nestor Dordoni held the ball 
around the eight-meter mark. His 
defender dropped back, opening up 
a lane to shoot, and Dordoni didn't 
hesitate. 

"I have been more confident with 

my shot [as1 of late:' Dordoni said. 
"We have so many weapons on the 
team that they don't really concen-
trate on me. They dropped off me, 
so I just shot if' 

Dordoni sent a blast straight to 
the corner. The ball hit two bars and 
still had enough POW6r to go into 
the net. The crowd went wild, and 
Dordoni pointed to his father in the 
crowd. 

"I could kind of tell:' senior util-
ity Jesse CaseUini said. "In the back 
of my mind, 1 thought [Dordonil 
might shoot this. He just snapped his 

wrist, and it went in:' 
With the 10-9 win, UCSD cap-

tured its 14th WWPA titie, ending 
the Lions' three-year reign as league 
champs. The team also set the school 
mark for wins in a season with 25 
- beating last year's mark of24 with 
the NCAA Final Four still left to play 
on Dec. 2 and Dec. 3. 

"\t's a great team to do it:' Randall 
said, referring to the 25 wins. 
"Everyone knows their roles and 
everyone does their roles perfectly:'

Volleyball ~umped from Elite Eight 
By Matt Croskey 

STAFF WRITER 

The time has come for the four 
UCSD women's volleyball seniors to 
hang ur their shoes, as the final chap-
ter has been written about their sto-
ried careers as Triton players. 

But don't think for a minute they 
are upset with the way the season 
came to an end. 

"Initially, we were disappoint-
ed," senior outside hitter and cap-
tain Nicole Courtney said. "But we're 
proud of how far we went, and it was 
an accomplishment even to make it to 
nationals. Of course we'd like to win, 
but really only one team can end the 
season without being disappointed:' 

Despite the season-ending loss to 
No.2 University of Minnesota Duluth 
in the quarterfinals of the NCAA 
Division II National Championships 
on Nov. 16 on the University of West 
Florida campus, the team finjshed the 
sea on with the Pacific Region cham-
pionship, its first since 200 1, and a 
26-3 overaIJ record. 

"These girls are fantastic people; 
head coach Tom Black said. "They 
defUlitely worked harder than any 
other team in the country and that's 
what got them in the Elite Eight. It's 
been a really rewarding process as 
their coach:'
