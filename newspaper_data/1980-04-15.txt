Proposition 9 
Falls Behind 
In State Poll 

SAN ~CISCO (AP) - Public opinion 
has swung sharply against Howard Jarvis' tax-
cutting Proposition 9 in the last two months, 
according to the Mervin Field California poll 
released yesterday. 

In the poll, 48 percent of those surveyed 
oppose the measure on the June ballot while 43 
percent are' in favor. In February, only 34 
percent were against the proposition to cut state 
income taxes in half while 54 percent were in 
favor. 

The swing corresponds with what the poll 
found to be an increase in awareness of the 
proposition. Sixty-one percent said they had 
heard of the issue and knew something ,about it 
- an increase of 21 percent over February. 

Architect Frederick Olmstead's 
Work In Central Library Exhibit 

An exhibit of the drawings 
and letters of Frederick Law 
Olmstead, an important 19th 
century architect and part-time 
abolitionist, is now on display in 
the Central Library. 

Olmstead (r.) kept up an 
extended correspondence with 
friends and contractors about his 
work. 

About the Stanford University 
Quadrangle, (above, designed in 
1886), he wrote Leland 
Stanford, the school's founder 
and benefactor, "If we are to 
look for types of buildings and 
arrangements suitable to the 
climate of California, it will 
rather be in those founded by the 

wiser men of Syria, Greece, Italy 
d S . " an pam. 
Writing to the Board of 

Commissioners about New York 
City's Central Park (below) in 
1861, Olmstead said: "On this 
foundation I have now to build: 
this ' canvas I have to paint, this 
rough-hewn head to chisel and 
rub into the delicacy and 
crispness of life - these rude 
brown and grey slopes, poles 
and stocks, to nurse and tend and 
train." 

Tuesday., April IS, 1980 

The poll said that the 49 percent of those now 
opposed to Prop 9 said they were afraid needed 
services and major programs would be cut if the 
measUre passed. Another 23 percent of those 
against the measure said that they were afraid 
the state budget couldn't handle such a large 
cutback. 

Among those in favor of Prop 9, 36 ~cent 
said the~felt that taxes were too high and had to 
be cut. Twenty-seven percent said they felt the 
government should cut unnecessary e~. 

Fifty-eight ~cent of IliI of those polled said 
they felt that if Prop 9 paned, serioua cuta would 
have to be made in govenunent services. Thirty. 
two percent said they thought the cuts wouJd not 
be too serious.

Physics Class Creates Cheap, Useful Gizmos 
$10 Plus . Microprocesser Equals 
Sun Tracker, Ion Gauge, Etc, Etc. 

BY MARK WILSON 
Staff Writer 

Physics at UCSD can be a 
lot more than just endless 
equations to memorize and 
impossible teslB to take , or at 
least that is what one small 
group of students discovered 
last quarter. 

For the 35 people enrolled 
in Physics 120C, the more 
practical applications of the 
earth's physical phenomenon 
proved to be the meat of the 
class. 

Under the direction of 
professor Carl Mc IIwain, 
students employed their 
accumulated knowledge of 
physics to create such things 
as a sophisticated intruder 
alert alarm, a sound-seeking 
miniature car and a complete 
aquarium environment 
controDer. 

What is even more 
intriguing than the ingenuity of 
these projects is the lime, 
space and co.t limitations 
within which the students were 
forced to work. 

McDwain feels that the 

limitation., preventable or not, 
helped bring "real world" 
problems into the university 
phy.ics lab. "I emphasized 
originality and team work, but 
a110 the ability of writing out a 
propo.a1 or budget request," 
he says . 

"Just being able to meet a 
deadline," was an important 
aspect that added to the 
realism of the projects . 
McDwain feels that all of these 
skills wal be very useful when 
the students graduate and go 
out looking for phy.ics-related 
jobs. 

Every project in the class 
centered around a tiny 
microproces.ing unit which, 
according to physics student 
Larry Sadwick, is "to modify 
information from the outside 
world to provide some external 
action." 

A $10 limit on materials 
allowed only small projects to 
be built, but despite thi., at 
least one of last quarter's 
works - an Ion Guage

Silence Spurs HL 
Bomb Threat Hoax 

A caller doing a "very poor job" at disguising his voice 
telephoned in a bomb threat to the Humanities Library on 
Revelle campus last night. 

The unidentified male contacted ~brary personnel at 10: 1 0 
pm and told them, "I am sick of silence. I am planting a 
bomb." He then laughed and hung up. 

According to UC Po~ce dispatcher Dick Hudnall, the 
~brary was cleared of students and workers within four 
minutes of the call. 

From information gained alter interviewing the ~brary 
workers who took the call, authorities determined that the 
bomb threat was a hoax and that there was no danger to the 
~brary. However, the three story structure remained closed 
last night for the remainder of its regular hours. 

The ~brary will be open as usual today.
