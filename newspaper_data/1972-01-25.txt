Reagan- Regents "shortchanging University," 
Simon- Regents are \\ b Â· II a uSing power, 

Corrie Rickey 
In a brief press conference prt!ceding the 

University of California Regents meeting of 
Friday, Jan. 21 , Governor Ronald Reagan 
defended his Administration 's treatment of 
higher education by citing that a declining 
number of professors have left the 
University since his inauguration. The 
reason for the diminishing number of 
discenchan ted professors, the Governor 
maintained. was due to the fact the 
University has pa id its professors 
adequately. 

In response to a verbal attack made the 
previous day by President Hitch, a remark 
about the s tagnacy of the University under 
the present state government, Governor 
Reagan replied , " I don 't believe it, of course 
... if the students are being shortchanged 
it's the Regents of the University that are 
doing it." 

When questioned by the press as to how he 
felt regarding the Regental threat to sue the 
State Legislature if the legislature imposed a 

I minimum teaching load on UC professors, 

I Reagan dismissed it as " in keeping with some of the other things they 've proposed ." The governor likened Angela Davis ' recent 
request to use the State 's money to employ 
attorneys of her choosing in her trial (in lieu 
of the public defender the state provides ) to: 
"waiting to hire a battery of attorneys and 

Reagan supports but Regents 
defeat facu lty pay increase 

Debbie Lavender 
The C Regents found themselves in the 

unusual position Friday of opposing a faculty 
pay raise while Governor Ronald Reagan 
favored It. 

At Issue was a motion by Regent Glenn 
Campbell that WJuid have given UC faculty a 
55 percent pay raise effective Jan. 1 through 
June 30. 

Long a staunch supporter of increasing 
faculty salarle . UC PreSident Charles tlltch 
opposed the measure because he felt It 
attacked the problem in the wrong way. 

Governor Reagan. who has vetoed faculty 
rost-of-Iiving pay raises for the last two 
yea r . voted in favor of Campbell's motion. 
" \ like being on the side of spending money 
for a change. ,. he smiled . 

The money in question was $4 .. 5 million of 
the Regents ' special reserve account. 
Campbell's proposal would have required the 
Regents to use these funds to finance the 
"interim" pay raise until the 1972-73 state 
budget. which provides for a 7.25 percent 
raise. takes effect July_l_. _ _ __ _

f 

Chairman William Frencb Smitb aDd UC 
Presidenl Cbarles Hitcb. 

Campbell explained that his mollon was "a 
method whereby the faculty would catch up 
on the five percent they have fallen behind I 
believe the faculty has earned the increase." 

But President Hitch said he simply could 
not support the proposal " \ find it very 
difficult to oppose any increase in faculty 
salaries. for any amount. from any source. 
But we just do not have the money. " 

Hitch was concerned over what he termed 
"a very dangerous precedent" - that of 
using the Regents ' funds to support "what 
ought to be the primary responsibility of the 
state" 

"Regents ' funds are used to support 
activities the state will not support. " said 
Hitch . "such as financial aid and EOP 
programs. residence halls. and enrichment 
programs." 

Hitch cited Instances in which " the 
Regents agreed to these temporary uses of 
funds for things the state was supposed to be 
paying for ." EOP was begun with Regents ' 
funds . and according to Hitch. " We have 
never received one dollar from the state for 
financial aid since . 

" If we use our funds for a faculty pay 
raise . the legislature will say. 'You did at 
once : you proved you can do it - now let's 
see you do it again.' It is not in the interest of 
the faculty to give the legislature the 
slightest impreSSIOn that we are willing to 
pick up the tab for functions the state hould 
support, ,. he concluded. 

Campbell 's motion was supported . 
however. by Regent Catherine Hearst. who 
commented . " I think we are very fortunate 
that when the rainY day has come for our 
faculty . we have the fun'ds to give them this 
vote of confidence and boost their morale ... 

But Finance Committee Chairman 
Edward Cartel disagreed. "FinanCially. we 
are on the ragged edge. Our reserves are no 
more than adequate. We have only 57 8 
million. not $9 million as Regent Campbell 
say : half of that is committed In contract 
agreement . It would be mo t imprudent for 
the Univer ity to delve Into these funds for 
this pay raise. and an extremely bad 
precedent to set. "

send her bill to the taxpayers " Noticeably 
ruffled by the questions about Miss DaVIS. 
reporters then confronted Reagan with 
questions concerning the recent activities of 
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
Brown Jr , who has been working With the 
federally funded Medicare. came under 
Reagan 's verbal attack as being "motivated 
purely by his political aspirations." Reagan 
refused to use Brown 's name in this 
discussion, preferring to refer to him as the 
"Secretary of State" and "my predecessor 's 
son." 

Reagan left the press room and entered the 
Regent's meeting where Provost Saltman of 
Revelle College and Chancellor McHenry of 
UC Santa Cruz were defending the clu ter 
college system. The Regents closed the 
doors to the public and went into executive 
session to discuss. as later revealed the 
acqui ition of land In Isla Vista near C 
Santa Barbara. 

Regent orton Simon made one of hi rare 
appearances at a Regents ' meeting I he 
attended four in 1971) by petitioning that 
discussion about Isla Vista and the park take 
place during an "open" or public sessIOn of 
the Regents ' meeting. After Simon received 
in the mail confirmation that the Isla Vista 
talks would be held during the afternoon open 
sessIOn. he arrived in time for the afternoon 

meeting. only to find that Chairman William 
French Smith had transferred the talks from 
the afternoon open sessIOn to the mormng 
executive session . and Regent Simon ml ed 
the diSCUSSion. 

Simon angrily accused Chairman Smith 
and PreSident Hitch of abUSing their power 
With white-hot invective. Simon la hed out 
against all the Regent for allOWing such a 
travesty to take place. While Chairman 
Smith repeatedly asked Simon to refrain 
from peaking because he was out of order 
Regent Simon. refUSing to listen any longer 
to Smith and Hitch. tormed out of the 
meeting and called a press conference 

HI remarks concerning the Smith-Hitch 
agenda SWitch were. "It's one of the greatest 
abuses I've ever een the Board of Regents

Saltman debates abortion 
Dr. Paul Saltman , the dynamic and well-known provost of 

UCSD's Revelle College, has agreed to debate the president of 
the Southern California Right-to-Life League on the subject of 
abortion , The debate, to be held on caRlpus within three weeks. 
is sponsored by the UCSD Law and Forensics Society. 

Dr. Saltman's opponent is Dr. Waiter Trinkus, who is a 
professor of law at Loyola University in addition to being 
president of the RightÂ·to-Life-League. Dr. Trmkus will be 
debating the " anti-" side of the formal topic " Resolved , That 
There is aRight to Abortion. " 

The debate is the second in a series of scheduled debates on 
current topics to be held on campus this year. Kevin Olson, 
director of the Law and Forensics Society, said that the next 
debate will be between Patrick Geary, county director of the 
conservative Young Americans for Freedom. and possibly a 
representative of the Trotskyist-<iominated Young Socialist 
Alliance, on the subject of Red China, 

The Saltman-Trmkus debate is open to all. and there will be a 
period after the formal debate for questions from the floor . 
The exact time and location will be published in a future issue 
of the TIMES. 

People House opens 
From the need for a student dropÂ·m center and a crisis 

counseling c~nter. People House has evolved. Open from about 
noon to 2 p.m. every day, over five hundred people responded 
last week to an open invitatIOn to drop in at any lime for a free 
peanut butter sandwich and coffee. This IOvitation IS still open 
this week, says the staff, "until we run out of peanut butter. " 

Situated in MUIr Apartment K-2, one of the main purposes of 
People House is to give students a place to go when they don 't 
have anything to do, to relax. and meet new people in a very 
unstructured atmosphere. As one staff member explained. 
"One of the problems on this campus IS that too many people 
are hvmg In a shell. They may live m the dorms, know the 
people In theIr suite or their wmg but here IS another 
opportunity to meet and get to know other people here on 
campus"

Costs are high 

Student discontent with housing grow 
Editors note: Tbe following article 

deals witb student dbcontent with 
bousing available both on and off 
campus, In a follow up article to be 
published next Tuesday the UCSD 
administration 's position on the 
housing problem will be explored. 

Rick Drom 
UCSD students are "unhappy and 

disgruntled." at the very least. about 
pre ent hOUSing tJnditions. according 
to Les Atkin on, member of the Office 
of ReligIOUS Affairs . Paul Kaufman 
told the TRITON TIMES that "the rent 
charged for onÂ·campus housing is 
unreasonably high ." But what are 
students doing about the housi ng 
situation? 

The first idea of what housing should 
be like at UCSD was brought forth in a 
master mversltv Community Plan. 
first published in i959. There. goal for 
the development of the entire 
community were et down . including 
"providIng 1011'- and moderateÂ·income 
housing conveniently erving the 
campus." But Rancho La Jolla. the 
first sample of hou ing to be built. is 
not low or moderately priced . 
according to Kaufman. 

"Guide for Growth" 
For this and other rea ons the 

Community Planning Commission wa 
organized to try and keep future 
development In the spirtt of the 
CommuDlt\' Plan. ThIS commls Ion 
worked to revise and clarify the plan to 
'provide a guide for community 

growth In concert with an emerging 
great university " 

After thi revi ed plan was 
publi hed. orne questioned whether 
future land use would be de Irable 
from a tudent 's point of view In order 
to find oul how students feel about 
housmg. three tudents. JIm Magill. 
Jeff Benjamin and Tom Shepard. 
worked on and ullimatel~' published a 
"student communit~Â· planning project " 

la t year . The project consisted of a 
questionnaire which was sent to 1154 
people both on and off campus. Almost 
700 of these 100-question forms were 
subsequently returned and tabulated. 
The results were then analvzed to 
generate some conclusions' about 
student feeling. 

Some of the conclusions were pretty 
strongly worded. The report aid that 
" the Univer ity collects its outrageous 
rentals. and we don't mean this lightly. 
Students can only afford so much and 
to find thaI the greatest rip-off is 
coming from the University itself is 
disgraceful. " In addi tion the study 
concluded that "in planning for 
commercial goal , there IS negligible 
thought to unique student needs. " 

In the last few month the University 
Community Planning Forum wa's 
organized to air all points of view on 
housing and "iron out " any difficulties 
at this level instead of at a meeting of 
the San Diego Planning Commi sion. 
according to Atkin on. viceÂ·chairman 
of the Forum. 

Fact Sheet Published 
I n addition the Associated Students 

recently published a fact sheet to tell 
students about the problem In the last 
week of the Fall Quarter a hou si ng 
meeting was al 0 held in the Revelle 
cafeteria in the hopes of bringing about 
some changes. but this was poorly 
attended because of bad publicity and 
fall finals . 

ThiS quarter Kaufman hopes that a 
coalition can be formed to work on the 
hOUSing problem. Hershal Warlick . 
MUIr College representatil'e to the AS. 
has been calling some groups to 
organtze thiS coali~ion MECHA has 
discussed the matter and appointed a 
subcommIttee to be on the coalition 
The Black Students Union . Native 
Americans and the Muir College 
Council have also been contacted . 
Exa t1y how thl coalition WIll work 

has not been decided. but Warlick 
would like to see a 15Â· to 20-student 
subcommittee formed of all those 
interested in work to achieve the 
coalititon's goa ls. 

Kaufman told the TRITON TIMES 
he feels the coalition "should demand 
at the Regents' meeting a commitment 
from the Regents themselves to 
recogmze that there i a critical 
problem as far as housing. If the 
Regents are unwilling to make a 
commitment toward reducing the cost 
of the dorms at the earliegt possi ble 
time. there are other recourses . one of 
which is a possible rent strike ." 

Alternatives Available 
Kau fman is " hoping for a 

commitment from the Regents the 
third quarter of this year ." But he has 
ou tlined other courses of action. One 
alternative is legal action through the 
San Diego City Council. Kaufman cited 
Berkeley as a campus where this 
action has been used. Another option 
would be for students to develop their 
own types of housing either on or off 
University land. 

If students are intere ted in the 
hou ing situation and would like to 
work on the problem. Kaufman 
suggests that they join the coalition 
when it is formed and attend the 
University Community Planning 
Forum to get their opinions known , 
Kaufman add that it would be "an outÂ· 
and-out mistake to underestimate the 
power of the Forum. " and that " it will 
requIre close scrutiny by all who are 
interested in seei ng the master plan is 
followed to make sure proposed 
developments are m consistent with 
the Plan ." The next meeting of the 
Forum Will be on Feb. 9 at 7:30 in 
Conference Room A on Matthews 
Campus. The next meeting of the 
proposed coalition will be on Wed . 
January 26th in the 9th floor seminar 
room in Tioga at i ' 30 p.m.

little finanCial aid has come

statement said. "ThiS IS why 
we have been compelled to 
demand that the state pay the 
enormous cost of the 
defense" 

According to MI SS Davis 
attornevs and committee 
staff members. her lawyers. 
now four In number. have 
been paid $5 .000 a month in 
fees since la st January. The 
cost of a professional 
InvestlgatorÂ·paid $200 a day 
for two weeks and staff costs 
have resulted in a total 
expenditure of $70.000 by the 
legal defense fund during 
1971. they said 

Moore. noting tha t the 
attorneys were receiving " far 
below" what defense lawyers 
ordinarily would charge in a 

case of thiS kind. sa id the 
request for state assistance 
was made to try to achieve a 
"reasonable parity" WIth the 
resources available to the 
prosecu tion.

the state under recentlv

Lautrec Works Exhibited 

Ninety-seven works by Henri 
de Toulouse-Lautrec comprise 
a major exhibition featured at 
the Ftne Arts Gallerv of San 
Diego. Balboa Park.' January 
22 through March 5 The 
paintings. drawing~ and prints 
by Lautrec are on loan from the 
BaldW in M Baldwin 
Collection. Newport Beach. 

Some extremelv rare 
graphics by this weiI known 
French artist are represented 
in the exhibition These include 
La Gitane, an advertisement 
made by the artist for a play. 
us 109 a single zinc plate. Le 
Pendu , a marvelous black and 
white poster which suitably 
illustrates a scene of the 
macabre. and the Moulin-
Rouge, an advertisement for 
that f amou nightclub. ThiS 
print. moreover. has the added 
band With lettering at the top . 
Lautree completed nearly 400 
prints In a short period of nine 
vears . 1891-1900 Of these 
ilthograph . and a few 
etchtngs . used for songcovers. 
menus. and play program . It 
was the po ters which 
established the artist's fame in 
hiS own day. The critiCS during 
his lifetime . on the whole. gave 
a better reception to the 
posters than to hiS painting 

>, ' ..-, 

The general public which 
regarded his paintings as 
" horrors, " was amused bv 
them without understanding 
their artistic value. According 
to Edouard Julien, .. 0 one 
surpassed him In 
understanding of the unyielding 
1a ws tha t govern poster 
design." 

The art of Lautr ec 
graphically presents the 
colorful Parisian night life at 
the end of the 19th centur\,. 
During his brief career lie 
presented actors. dancers. 
singers. prostitutes. and 
writers as they passed across 
the stage of life . The pulsating 
theatrical world was an 
inspiration to his talent and he 
captured it most vividly 

The life of Lautrec i so well 
documented that additional 
words about him seem 
superfluous . The aristocratic 
artist who died at the age of 37 
having lived life to its extreme. 
in two decades captured the 
spirit of his age - of Paris and 
its cafe-concert life and the 
wonderful world of 
personalities aSSOCiated With It 
- on canvas and paper for 
generations who follow to enjoy 
and re-live.

intellectuals who claim 
America is " going fascist" be-
cau '~ ul u .. :: Chicago-7 trial..or 
Spiro Agnew 's peeches. while 
ignoring the relative succe of 
fasci sm in Europe. 

The Intellectual aspects of 
the book go down hill fast after 
thi s. as Revel turns to the 
dctail of Amencan political 
life . He imagines the ;'-;ew Left 
to be qUite powerful. while the 
igns of its int rna I decadence

Yet. lhe mes age IS stili

Looking around himself on the

genocide. The Ideologies of 
Europe have failed . and the

Fencers Frighten Foes 
Take Two Trophies 

If you happened to try and utilize the gym faCilities last 
weekend. you might have noticed the presence of whiteclad 
warriors With sleek swords. dancing to and fro m an attempt to 
out-duel each other's thrusts and parryies. Those gallant 
swordsmen from 16 southern campuses were competing in the 
third annual UCSD fencing tournament . which took place 
Frid3\'. Saturda\', and Sundav of la t week. For 28 hours. 180 
contestants sought mdividual and team honors by competing in 
mens' and womens' foil, and mens' epee and saber. 

Frida\' saw the commencement of the epee segmellt of the 
tournament. After seven hours of grinding competition. Dan 
Loder of Cal State Long Beach emerged a the victor after 
defeatln~ Bernie Guzenske of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and 
Harold 'tan Hote of U C In a three-way fence-off Howard Eno 
and Stan Robinson of ec 0 finished fourth and fifth. 
respectively. to help give the Tntons the overall team trophY. 

Samrdal"s event, women .. fOil and mens' saber. lasted a 
total of 13 hour and two bottles of as'Pinn . Once it was o\'er . 
Blvthe De\an from Cal State LA had Wllhstood the hours and a 
play-{)ff With D bble Robertso.n to become the womens ' foil 
champion. Ten Bre. hlnl of LCSO ended up as consolatlOll 
Winner. In the m n' 'aber finals. ,\ndy Perhach from Cal Pol~ 
an LUIS Obispo ouHenced L'CSD 's Richard Sax to capture the 

title l'CSD placed very lI'ellm thi pa rticular event. with four 
out of the SIX po sible finalists . They were Stan Robinson 14th) .

-

Cal Cagnolalli 15th l and Mike Jones 16th l. Because 01 the fin 
efforts of these Individuals. UCSD captured the team saber 
championship. UCSB won the women .. foil event. 

On Sunday the mens' foil once again involved a fence-{)ff 
between participanls with Identical records in the 
champIOnship matches. This time Doug Skilling of Cal Pol~ 
surVived the challenge of hi teammale Andy Perhach and 
Mark Berrv of UCSB. Mostlv because of these two. CSSLO wa~ 
awarded ttie team title . . 

In all it wa an extremel\' succe sfu l tournament for coach 
Jim White and hiS players. a they once again proved why the~ 
are probably the most ucce sful sportsters on this campus.

First thing to do is make sure no cops are 
around . Look up on the top of the hill to be 
sure one isn 't just silting there killing some 
lime and waiting to catch somebody like you. 
The coast's clear - OK . Quick, whip into the 
little drive in front of the gate ; put on the 
parking brake, give your keys to your buddy: 
he jumps out of the car , leaving the door 
open behind him, unlocks the gate and swings 
It open: let up on the brake and coast down 
the hill past the gate : your fr iend snaps the 

Illek back together and leaps mto the car : 
next thing. you're roaring down the hill UI 
vlJu' re past the pomt where anyone can see 
I'OU from above 

The road is Wide enough for only one ear . 
which IS OK, because vou 're not likelv to see 
anyone coming up . You go winding down In 
low gear, your engine pushing redline due to 
the steepne s of the hill. Now you 're there-
nobody else on the beach as far as you can 
'1'1' Huge bluffs shelter you from the rest of 
the world above. and sweeping in like 
messengers from another hemisphere are 
long blue lines 

Beyond the beach. they are even and 
rather flat. but as they near the shore. 
several humps gradually break their 
straightness. These build into thick mounds 
of water, as you sense their enormous energy 
potential before YOU. As the wave reaches its 
peak. it is held up momentarily as the wind 
blows into ItS fa ce. The next moment, it is 
shattered: the peak falls into the empty air 
before It. and with a crash strikes lhe water 
In front of the wave. From here on the rest of 

the wave follows suit, the crest falli ng evenly 
across the waves' face travelling a good 
length of the beach, until the energy subside 
with just remnants of the pounding foam 
washing up on the shore. There is only one 
place with this unique et of conditions. 
Blacks Beach. 

Blacks has become something of a legend 
for California surfers. You get to meet a lot 
of people as you travel for waves up the coast 
who say they've been there (and yet don 't 
seem to be able to recall where it is or what 
it looks like) : there are others who'll just ask 

If ItS really as good a the photos In Surler 
Magazme would have you believe. Then 
there are lots of locals who tell VI Itmg 
surfers from L.A .. oh, Blacks IS fucked, don Â·t 
believe the pictures, It only happens once a 
year, etc . Or. you might happen to catch a 
conversa tion between friends on, wow! such 
fantastic waves at Blacks. the best I 've seen 
Funny thing is. everything said is true. 

The lock and gate episodes are mostly a 
thing of the past. however Since they 
changed the lock about th2 middle of last 
winter, keys are qui te scarce. And even If 
you're lucky enough to get one, t~e cops noll' 
patrol the parking area pretty regularly 
handing out $4 tickets and threatening with 
charges of tre passing . The curious thing 
about it, i that Blacks is state property, 
owned by the University , yet available 
exclusively for the use of the residents of La 
Jolla Farms (you. know, all those uper 
$100.000 home across the highway from 
school) . Why can't students. or other use 
the road ? School administrators refer to it as 
a "dangerous beach" beset with riptides 

accessible only by a "geologically unsafe 
road." Hmmm. Wonder what thev know 
about rips. waves and water safety-? There 's 
one further reason. incidentally : the 
Regents ' contract on the land In questIOn 
provides that the road and the beach are to 
be used only by Farms reSidents However, 
as much as a hassle as thiS seems. It's 
actually better In some ways than if It were 
open to the general public. Since the walk IS 
so long and tiring (particularly after surfing 
a few hours) it is a stronl( inducement to go 
someplace else. And that helps cut down on 
the crowds. Of course. it stili gets plenty 
crowded. but that's mostly on the weekends 
or holidays ' 

So much for the hassle Because when It' 
good. it's well worth the walk On a sunny 
winter morning. Ihe cliffs keep the sunhl(ht 
off the waves until about 8 o'clock or so It' 
a little eerie paddling out IOta the gloom . 

particularl~' seeln~ the blue-green of the 
water several hundred vards beyond the surf 
zone. Paddling out IS n'o fun atÂ·Blacks. Spot 
where the rip is flOWing seaward. a powerful 
fiver of water that has been washed up onto 
the beach Seeking a way out. It carve, a 
deep channel between the sandbarsOn d 6-7 

day. there IS a consistent inSide shorebreak 
0(3-4 ' crashing in the shallows about every 6 
seconds This is the hardest partÂ· when you 
manage to get through a few smaller ones. 
vour heart crowds your throat m dreaded 
antiCipation that a large wave will break out 
beyond your position . If it look clear. you 
paddle for everything you 're worth, dOing It 
on maybe pure fear ' lnsplred adrenahn.

Evaluations 
Editor : 

Concerning your article of 
Jan. 18 on student evaluati on of 
the facultv. it is curiou that 
some facul ty member who 
may routlne l v evaluate 
students on the Â·ba I of two-
hour exams and a three-hour 
f inal should be re luctant to be 
j udged by students after 30 
hours of contact. 

Provost Stewart is quoted as 

saying that , " It may not even 
be fair to judge a teacher 
against another who is younger 
and less exper ienced." Prof. 
Klima tated," A profes or 
may have a bad quar ter and . . 
the r esults would not reflect his 
true abili ty." For " professor " 
or .. teac her .Â·' substi tute 
"studentÂ·' and defend the 
grading system. 

Ob v i o u s l y a trull'

validate evaluations of Â·the

proponents of the plan believed 
the UC professors were betng 
cheated ou t of their rightful 
wage and should be 
compensated for the Regents' 
lack of funding; those opposed 
to the plan expressed the 
feeling that the Governor and 
the state would feel less likely 
to give the faculty a pay htke 
when fulure budgets are 
proposed President Hitch 
expla ined that he felt rellcent 
about setting a precedent by 
using these contingency fund's 
for someth ing that the state 
should be f inanCing. The 
measure lost 13 to 6. Governor 
Reagan supported the u sage of 
the Discretionary Fund .

The arguments of Hitch and Carter convmced most of the

by the Regents Statewtde AcademiC CounCil Chatrman Paul 
Zinner concur red With them 

" We do not want to receive even a svmbolic token of what lie

Umverslty. We respect the arguments of Pre Ident and other
