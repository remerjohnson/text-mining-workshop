A olle e Review Committee 

formed last spring will recommend 
\\lays to impro e - possibly even 
aboli:h - the present four college 
system here at C'D. 

A President Jules Hagneris is 
concerned with what decision th 
committ, might make. 

" [nclicators point to the fact that 
the commi tt i: window-dressing for 
a decision that's already been made to

Hagneris said.

What happened 
to Fritz? 

Among our friends in 
college, Sen. Walter "Fritz" 
Mondale was the real thing. 
Many of u s con idered 
working for the thoughtful on 
of a Unitarian minister who 
oppo ed the Vietnam War and 
championed minority and 
women' right in the early 
I 970s. 

It wa al. 0 easy to admire a 
fellow who dropped an early 
pre idential bid in 1974 with 
the comment that the White 
House wasn 't worth spending 
night after night in Holiday 
Inns. 

Mondale impressed our 
Watergate·weary friends 
when he acknowledged that 
running for president was 
"mindless ." Bowing out in 
tyle , he admitted that a 

national campaign required 
one to move "in the direction of 
compromise and I ju t don ' t 
think I'm suited for it. " It was 
almost a if our perfect 
ca ndidate emerged there and 
then. 

Mondale made the e as tute 
observations seven years ago 
next week. Today, it appear , 
he's forgotten them entirely. 
He 's already groveling with 
t he be t of them on the 1984 
presidential campaign trail -
and he didn't waste a moment 
before jumping in . 

After los ing the vice 
pre idency a year ago, he told 
The New York Times that he 
wa anxiou to "go back to 
learn, to think thing through 

The Bottom Line 

and tal k to all ort of people 
about where we s hould go." 

But les than two weeks 
after Ronald Reagan 's 
inauguration, Mondale and 
upporter filed document ' 

with the Federal Election 
commiss ion, forming the 
"Committee for the Fu ture of 
America." On the s urface, this 
political action committee 
(PAC) will raise and spend 
money on a variety o f 
Democratic candidates. But 
it's al 0 underwriting 
Mondale's current expenses 
on the unofficial campaign 
trail. 

During the first s ix month 
of this year , Mondale ' 
committee garnered $217,000. 
At $1,000 each, former Carter 
campaign Chairman Robert S. 
Strauss and ex ·Treasury 

ecretary G. William Miller 
have been among the PA 's 
contributors. 

Meanwhile , Mondale is 
"earning" a six·figure alary 
as a "problem so lving " 
attorney for the Washington 
office of the Chicago· based 
firm, Winston & Strawn. He 
has a staff of fi ve and a 
I imous ine at his di posa l. 

Moreove r, Mond a le has 
joined the corporate boards of 
Columbia Pi c ture and 
Control Data Corp., and IS 
servi ng as a "consu ltant" to 
the Northwest Energy Co. of 
Salt Lake City. Northwest 
Energy is one of \0 compani s

Letter to the Editor 

A modest proposal 
Editor: 

The articles appea ring 
lately in Til Guardian 
conce rning mi suse of AS 
fu nd s, while va luable in 
revea ling the most obvious 
abus s, fail to recognizc the 
mo t important i sue 
underl ying thesc abuses. 

The AS Council has been 
given the ex tremely difficult 
task of "wisely" allocating the 
"correct" amount of money to 
the various organizations and 
c au es which hungrily 
compete for their favor . Why 
has the council been given 
s uch a troublesome task? The 
an wer is, in theory, that the 
AS council is not burdened by 
thi s task at all. Since it is 
merely a representative head 
of the larger s tuden t body it 
wil\ oncentrate on establi h· 
ing and maintaining effective 
co mmuni ca tion with the 
tudents and threrfore will 

make deci ions which re fl ect 
their se ntiments with a 
minimum of error. 

Over the past few week we 
have witnessed the investiga· 
tion and publica tion of AS 
Council errors w hich reflect a 
break ·down of t he ideal sy t m 
of , tudent government; i.e .. 
student sentiments are not 
being accurately represented 
in cou nci l deci s ions. Some 
students feel misrepresented, 
abused, and angry. as they 
very well should! I propose, 

however. that (he current 
" revolt " is occurring much too 
late and is misdirected , as 
well. Th e seed fo r the 
s tudents' di scontent was 
planted long before they 'eem 
to realize, in the form of a -
mandatory Campus A tivit y 
Fee. 

The time i now ripe to 
que tion thi policy. Why isn't 
payment of the Campus 
Activity Fee made voluntary? 
Wh y must payment of this Fee 
be a prerequisite for 
enrollment at UCSD? Why is 
the forced payment of the 
Activity Fee an all·or·nothing 
affair? Final\y, why is the 
individual student forced to 
trust another group to 
"correctly" pend hi I her 
money once it has been paid? 

I propose that the Activity 
Fee be made voluntary and 
that the individual s tudents, 
not the AS Council , should 
decide how the money is to be 
spent. If the individual decides 
to pay the Fee he could fil\ out a 
ca rd in c luded in hi s 
regis tration packet which li sts 
(he possible recipients of his 
money nex t to a 0·100 percen t 
ca le. The tudent could 

indicate how much money he 
wishes to pay and who exactly 
is to receive it. The support of a 
certain group or cause could be 
proved by a copy of hi s Activity 
Fee ca rd which the Cas hier 

would va lidate. 
The implemcntation of this 

program will takc the vote of 
st udent support out of the AS 
Counci l and will replace it in 
the hands of its only true 
owner; the ind ividual. No 
longer would there be ca use to 
be disa ppointed in the AS 
Council for failing to represent 
any group or individual in 
terms of mi sappropriated 
fund. The individual would 
be re ponsible only to himself, 
a he hould be. A pecial 
interes t group would have to 
appeal to the entire tudent 
body to earn econom ic 
s upport, and would not simply 
have to pers uade a few 
influential members of the AS 
Council. 

The AS Council can not 
po s ibly give an accurate 
repre se ntation of each 
s tudent 's sentiments and so 
s hould be relieved of the task. 
The decision s regarding 
economic upport of tudent 
organizations shouild be made 
by the only body which ca n 
trul y represe nt s tudent 
sentiments: the indi vidual 
s tudents them ·elves. As for 
myself, I refuse to let this is .. u 
fad e away as long as any gorup 
orcausewhich Idonot support 
politically or morall y ca n 
truthfu ll y boast that thcy 
have my economic support!

War reporters: dying for a byline 
BY MIKE AHN 

One ca n see it ev ry five or ix months, depending 
on the disposition of the world; a special box in 
.Velt'slt'eek reporting the death of Oliver Rebbol. a 
French photographer covering the Salvadorian 
Insurrection, or the loss of two NBC sou ndmen who 
went down with their helicopter whi le hovering 
above a tiny isle crammed with Haitian refugees. It 
is a pat tern that will go on forever, as long as there 
are news and newspeople. Reporters gel\ ing killed ; 
each tory i . different yet till very much the same. 

What 's dIfferent is how it happens. Ernie Pyle 
gets machine·gunned in the Pacific. ABC's Bil\ 
Stewart, murdered by a Nicaraguan soldier on a 
deserted street as the camerama n capt ures the 
moment. Don Bolles, an Arizona reporter who gets 
blown up by a bomb under his car because he had 
uncovered a land fraud deal. The stories are not too 
pleasan t to say the least. 

But there is a l'io something the same about these 
dead men: they paid the price for the one reason 
that giv s a journalist life: no matter how bad it pays 
or how much abuse he must takc. It is the a bsolute, 
childlike glee of being fmit to tell the wor ld . It is a 
glamou r that can 't be reproduced anywhere. 

It 's not that the journalish that do dangerous 
things ha\ e to do them: thl'v a ll \'() luntcl'r. No onl' 
really know ... why certam people are \\ illing to ri sk 

their li ves for a stor y. I doubt the reporters 
themselves know either. It i ~ jus t the th ing to do, like 
some reporters a lways covcr sports or fas hion. 

I think the one~ that look for th action do so 
because, when t hey are in the s tory, it i~ like li ving in 
the third degree, a height ened sense of emotion and 
feeling to a point where they are hooked on it. Those 
who know say that once you've been in danger 
normal life seems to go a little flat. 

And the icing on the ca ke is the idea of telling the 
rest of the world about what you saw; how it was. 
and what It felt like. There's no detachment here, 
t he s tor y and the reporter are each other. It mu s t be 
a good feeling. telling people what t hey wa nt to 
know . 

Sure, it 's a power trip. a thrill seeking \ .... ct drea m. 
But it is the onl y job that pays to be a kid; a life of 
rid ing on a dangerous roller coaster and gett ing off 
and telling th e res t oft h world how it was. Theonly 
probl ' m is sometimes the report r gets ea ten by hi:-. 
own Ix'at , in which case he and his loss become the 
s tory. A nd so on and '>0 furt h , un ti I there are no more 
wars or no more reporters. 

Yet even when it looks like it is all ovcr for th 
. report r he s till keep~ on going. I wonde r what was 

g() ing through that :--JBC ca merama n \ mind w hen, 
up to th' moment \\ llen he \'vas shot , he filmed 11111 

l ones' henchmen syst matically murdering the 
members of a visiting party. What kept him filming? 
Perhap it was a death wish that some journalists 
must ca rry, or a pure devotion to dut y, or some sort 
of fanaticism·optimi sm tha t he will livc to get the 
excl us ive, pushing himself like a modern knight in 
search of the Holy Grail. Maybe it was a ll of these 
motives, or none of them. I only know t hat th ey gave 
their maximum. ome survi\ed to fi le a s tory; and 
for others it wa. t heir last. 

Look for them on the television and in t he 
newsp'aper, those crazy guys who cover th war. 
They II be the ones doing lunatic things for the big 
story , like whf'n Sean Fl ynn used to tie a whit flag 
to a rlin bike and ride it out into battle to get a b Lter 
perspective for hi s pictures. ean Flynn took one 
las t ride into Cambodia and never ca me back . It 
looks like his last s tury will be his to keep with him 
forever . 

There 's rea ll y no point to thi s dying bullshit. it's 
just something you might want to know . It 's like 
this: as long a~ you \ ant to hear it there are those 
w ho will go through the ha zard s to gi ve it to you. 
Thr t wi 'it is that th y are proba bly getting a bigger 
kirk out of telling it than you are of getti rig it. In th 
('nd it \ all jus t rli scardHI informmion anyway, but 
for all the past report ' r:--. wejus t thought you'd like 
to know.

Mondale's back 
to campaigning 
conti nue d from page 2 
behind t he highly controver-
sial Alaskan natural gas 
pipeline project . According to a 
company spokesman , Mondale 
was hired because "we need all 
the help we can get." 

Mondale travels so much 
you'd think the election is next 
week. He typically traverses 
the country - from Miami to 
Las Vegas - touching bases 
with loyalists and spending 
time with Wall Street lawyers 
and oil company executives. 

Exactly what kind of future 
does Walter Mondale ee for 
America? Does he have any 
new ideas? Does he, like other 
Democrats, plan to wait in the 
wing until President 
Reagan's programs collapse? 

Though the former vice 
president lecture part·time at 
the University of Minnesota, 
hi s current schedule unfor· 
tunately allow little room for 
reflection and contemplation. 
While he claim to peruse 

po~ition papers and Shakes· 
peare during his pare time, he 
could only be doing it in his 
s leep. 

And though we've seen 
plen ty of wire photo of 
Mondale relaxing at home 
with a heaf of policy papers, 
we doubt their sincerity. 

Indeed, Walter Mondale 
knows exactly what he's up to . 
Hi s game plan is to go out 
early. run hard and lock up 

critical supporters. He' s 
modeling him self as the 
cent rist compromise candi · 
date. 

One could conclude that 
Mondale has adjusted his s tyle 
and values for the sake of the 
presidency, whatever the 
strain on his physical, mental 
and moral resources. But are 
these the sacrifices Mondale 
wants to make? fn his 1976 
book, Tlfe Accountability of 
Power, Mondale bemoans the 
fact that so much of a 
candidate's time is " pent 
with well · to-do pros pective 
contributor and 0 little with 
unemplo¥,ed or di sa bled 
worker .... 

Our politica l ystem often 
make milk·toa t out of 
principled men and turns off 
the most pu blic·m inded among 
u . But our hope fol' the new 
Mondale is t hat he tarts 
thinking , reading and 
listening to the "Fritz" we 
remember. 

After his mentor Hubert 
Humphrey los t the pre idency 
in 1968, the astute fre hman 
senator told the Washington 
Star that the Democrats 
deserved to lose some elect ions 
until they took new directions. 
"Many programs espoused by 
liberals in the last three 
decade ," Mondale admitted 
then , "have not worked and 
need to be reexamined ."

Clarifying the CWD debate 
Editor: 

I am wri t ing this letter to 
comment upon Mark Dress· 
ner' s letter ((;/(ardia ll , ~ov 
16). Although his letter IS 
basicall y correct, I feel that he 
omitted severa l important 
things. 

In his letter he implies that 
onl y one person spoke in favor 
of the CWI) at the la ·t A 
meeting, when in actuality 
five or 'ix people spoke in fa\'or 
of them . He mentions that the 
speaker from the CWO 
reso rted to name ca lling 
(which he did) and that those 
in favor of the CWD were rude 
while speake rs w ho were in 
favor of the CWO fr eze were 
speaking (w hic h they were). 
However t he audience wa 
rude during all the speeches 

and in my OpinIOn "aymg 
someone belong" m Jail (\\ hlch 
one pro freeze speaker said) 1'" 
resorting to name calling. 

Mark Dressner (and mam 
others) complain that the

Al so, if Mr. Dre",;ner had

The childishness of attacks on. CWD 
Editor: 

In the beginning weeks of 
this quarter, J attended a 
showing of the documentary 
on Vietnam, " Heans and 
Minds," an offering of the 
Friday night political film 
serie ; by chance, I happened 
to sit next to three loud and 
immature students who were 
vociferous in their diatribes 
against the series and the film. 
I caught the name of only one 
of them: Dave Tollner; hi 
ot her two cohorts were of a 
similar mold, however. 

Prior to showing the film, 
each in his turn declared that 
he could hardly wait to see 
American soldiers "kill the 
Gooks" and that the highlight 
of the film would be "the 
napalming of the' Vietnamese 
babies." Amidst a stream of 
similar invectives , the e three 
young men hauled out their 
cans of Coor and made a loud 
show of gaining attention for 
themselves through their 
remarks. 

Dave Tollner. as an AS 
member, aid to the other two, 
"Don 't worry, the film series 
won't be funded next year. I'll 
ee to that." During the 

hawing of the film itself, this 
trio interrupted frequently 
with catca ll s and jeer', 
applaudi ng not only the 
marching in formation of 
American troops but the 
vividly documented destruc-
tion of human life. An Asian 
woman seated to the other side 
became ill and was forced to 
leave after listening to the 
litany of their racist 
comment. 

As any viewer who has een 
the film can attest, " Hearts 
and Minds" is a film about 
learning to read between the 
lines; it mes age is that we 
must analyze information 
received from our media 
s ources and from our 
government and refuse to 
accept any pronouncements at 
face value. A documentary 
which juxtapose interviews 
with American politi ca l 
figure s, ex -veteran s, and 
Vietnamese peasants , again t 
news clippings from the war 
and the period prior to it, thi 
film attempt to trace the 
history of the American 
people's involvement in the 

. Vietnamese conflict and to 
point out the contradictions 

bet ween official gO\t!rnment 
pronou nC('men Land the 
reali ty of the live -of those who 
lived through the war. 

Thi message - of the 
necessity of learning to 
question one's world and to 
analyze information , placing it 
wit hi n a larger framework of a 
developing understanding of 
the complex international 
situation - i ultimately also 
the aim of a superior 
univers ity education _ This 
film should be een a ' one 
which contributes toward that 
end . Pre umably Mr. Tollner 
and friend have not yctgotten 
the message. 

Had this been merely a case 
of three youth who had not 
yet grown pas t the stage of 
boyi h identification with 
macho images, ] would not be 
writing to you now; I would 
merel y have tewed in my rage 
for ome time at a system that 
could have produ ed per on 
so lacking in value that they 
nearly salivate at the pro pect 
of eeing other humans -
even babies - maimed and 
killed; I would merely have 
hoped that they might 
encounter some fine profe or 

III' might read somc philoso-
pher along the way who would 
force them to question their 
values. 

There i ' anot her issue at 
stake , now, however, which 
forces me to relate thi 
incident to the Guardian 
readership. I have read in last 
Thursday's issue that thi 
very Dave Tollner ha s 
circulated a petition to have 
the fund ' for this same 
polit ical film series re cinded. 
Apparently , 1,000 souls have 
agreed with him; I wonder if 
they understand the extent of 
his views to which they ga ve 
their sanct ion . Were I an 
undergraduate, it would chill 
the marrow of my bones to 
have an elected official with 
such a conspicuous ab ence of 
ethics representing me on the 
AS council. That this young 
man plan to use thi s is ue a a 
plat form to run for AS 
Pre ident is even more 
disconcerting. If he wishes to 
see cancelled the type of film 
which encourages students to 
think and to question , if he 
wants to eliminate even the 
poss ibility of di cu sion of

on Revelle Plaza) and say he 
can ' t under tand it. That 
s truck me as odd . It was 
obviou: why he d id it. " The 
a lleged quotat ion doe~ not 
correspond in any way to my 
ac t ual words and sen t i men ts. I 
shared Winne's , and millions 
of ot her American '. sense of 
desperation at the course of 
t hc war, and at United ta tes 
poli c ies in that war . r 
under, tood very well why 
Buddhist monks set them-
selves afire in protes t, and I 
credited Winne with the same 
very comprehensible mot ives. 
At the sa me time I knew he 
was an emotionall y troubled 
young man. and I doubt that 
anyone commits suicide solely 
for political/ethical reasons. I 
thought at the time that it 
would be most appropriate for 
UCSD to erect a mode t 
permanent memorial to him. I 
still think so.

THE EXCEPTION 

Thursday, November 19, 1981 The UCSQ Gua rdian 7 

Group protests alleged animal abuses 
!j)' MARCIA ALCOULOUM RE 

Abou t 25 students and an 
Diego residen ts joined in 
protest of alleged cruelty to 
ammals in UCSD lab s 
Tuesday, procla iming that 
t hey are not opposed to 
sci ntific research but are 
simply agaiQst inhuman 
treatment of anima ls. 

At the mxm rally on Revelle 
Plaza, San Diego Animal 
Wei far Coalition spokesman 

(eve Kowit charged that 
UCSD researcher s are 

"torturing and. torm nting" 
laboratory animals. 

Reading from the sworn 
testimony of a UCSD 
technician, Kowit cited 
examples of neglig nt care of 
dogs used in surgical 
experiments, anu the cruel 
I reatment of ot her research 
anima ls. 

Although Kowil acknow· 
ledged that anima ls are 
neces sary for medi cal 
research , he charged that 
<;ome xperiments are only 

carried out to generate funds 
th rough grants. 

K()\vit a lso spok(' out against 
the practice of seilIng 
imlxmnded animals, usually 
51 ray pet s, for research. On h 
eIght stale~ - CalifornIa 
among them - allm' st ray 
pets to be sold for re~earch. 

A handout expressIng the 
Coalition's \'iew" states: "We 
bel ie\ e I his is a violat JOn of t he 
purpose of a 'humane' 
she lter. " 

Francis Felton, member of 
Friends of Animals, "poke on 

alternatives to usmg anImals 
In research. According to 
Felton, using human cell 
cultures or bactena as test 
organisms IS more accurate. 
effiCient. and ('conomlcal. 

\~ an example, Felton told 01 
one experiment on the effect. 
of cigareLte "moke on human 
lungs. One approach, she said. 
would be to cxpo"oe monktys to 
"moke·fJlled air for an 
('xtended time. The alterna-
ti\e would be 10 expose lung 
cell cu It u res t I) '" moke, and 

ob'>ene chromosome disor · 
ders. 

Felton al-,o urged the 
audlCnce to support HR 8111 
:i:1f), which would e..,tablJsh a 
nat J()flal center for alternat iw 
research (not im'ol\'Jngth u-,e 
of IJve animals/. The center 
\\ould Ix> financ(~ from a 
perf'(:ntagc of animal research 

fund~. 
Along wJlh holdmg the rally, 

the coal i lion set up a ta ble

Parking at UCSD: it can be an adventure 
BY GREGORY BARNARD 
You're not alone if you ha ve 

received a parking ticket while 
parked on the UCSD campus. 
An average of 96 tickets arc 
written on any given weekday, 
and an average of 2 ,550 ticket~ 
are written every month. 

There are ove r 7,500 
parking permit · issued at this 
time, but only 6,275 spaces in 
wh ich to park a car. Carole 
Cooner. an administrative 
assis tant wit h the Parking 
Enforcement Office says, 
"t his discrepancy is not 
uncommon for campuses 
nat ionwide, because not 
e\'eryone will be on campus on 
e\' ry day." 

Cooner adds, "People shou Id 

not allow their tickets to pile 
up, thinking they can go 
unpaid. We keep exact records 
here which are sent on to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles 
when the tickets become 
delinquent. You can't renew 
your vehicle registration until 
you pay your ticket plus the 
fines which are added for being 
late. They only way around 
paying your fines is to junk 
your car." 

The universi ty is not 
involved with collecting fines 
or admi ni s tering penalties . 
"We are mor than willing to 
talk to a student who has a 
legitimate problem and work 
~omething out with them. 
However, that do sn't mean a 

song" and dance will free you 
from paying your parking 
tickets ," C(xmer says. 

Man\' students cannot 
afford parking permits and are 
forced to park off·campus. 
which means coming to school 
early to find a slXH c!o-,e to 
campus. 

AS supports rally 

Last summer an engmeer 
\Vas hired by th univerSity to 
redesign the parking lots on 
campus. In t he Revelle lot 
a lone, the number of spaces 
was increased bv over ~OO. 
However, this meant designa-
ting cert a in spaces "for small 
cars only." A number of 
students said they dro\'e large 
cars and felt it unfair t hat the" 
shou ld be discriminated 
against because of the size of 
their car. 

This year the parkIng 
meters now cost more than 
twice as much for an hour of 
tim ,and on Iy four hour ... can 
be bought. Last year a quarter 
bought t\\'o and a half hour..,: 
this vear It buys one hour. rf 
you are on campus for more 
t han four hours vou must 
wal k out to your car'and inserl 
more money to keep from 
being t icketcd . 

After n ar ly an hou)' of 
heated discussion last night.

San Diego Transit proposes route change 
Alterations may effect student commuters to UCSD campus 

Propo 'ed San Diego Transit 
route change s will bc 
discu sed at a public hearing 
on Nov. 25, at 2 p.m. at the 
tran 'it corporation's head -
quarters at 10016th treet. 

Routes affected if the 
propo 'ed changes a re made 
would be routes 1,6, 15, l6,29, 
30, 32, 33/ 33A, 36, 50 and 80. 

" We are suggest ing these 
changes to help us better serve 
our customers, while making 
SDT more efficient economi-
ca lly," sa id Roger noble , DT 
general ma nager. "Most of the 
proposed changes come as a 
resu lt of our continuing route 
re-evaluat ion and effort s to 
Improve our service." 

Proposed rOllt e c hanges 
include: 

- Route 1 's downtown 
terminal wi ll b changed from 
5th Avenue and F Steet to 7th 
Avenue and G Street. This 
change is necessa ry because 
downtuwn redevelopment has 
elimina ted su fficie nt space at 
the 5t h Avenue and F Street 
terminal. 

- Route 6 buses would by-
pass Camino de la Reina, 
which would shorte n the route 
by two minutes each way. 
This change would provide a 
more re liable sched ule and a 
more adequat e running time. 
The service along Caminode la 
Reina , west of Miss ion Center 
Road, would be taken over by 
Rout e 16.

N e'W" technique for 
treating blood clots 

A new method of breaking up 
dangerous clots in art ries ha. been 
used succ sfully in several pati nts 
at the Uni\ersity of California. San 
Diego, Medical Center (University 
Hospital). 

treptokinase, a drug that 
di 'soke ' the support ing :-;tructures 
of blood clots, i:-; infused through a 
catheter directly into the clot. To 
hasten the breakup, a thin guide wire 
pa sed through the catheter is 
manipulated into the clot. 

elective infusion of the drug 
enable. phy"icians to deliver a high 
dose to the clot while minimizlIlg the 
amount I' aching the rest of the body, 
thus redu ing the risk of hemorrhage 
and allergic react ion. The technique 
a ppears safer and more effect ive than 
su rgical removal of the clot in many 
cases, part kularly when clots are 
lodged in ' mall \·essels. 

Circulatory di sorders involving 
blood cI t· are a leading cause of 
death and disability, cau ing heart 
attacks. lung damage. kidney failure , 
loss of limb and other problems. 
Once a clot forms in a blood vessel, it 
must be di per ed quickly or the area 
supplied by the vessel may die for 
lack of circulation. 

Seven patients at UCSD Medical 
enter have recei\'ed the new 

treatment over the past four months. 
FO'Jr had complete relief of their 
ob truction within one or two days. 
Another patient lost only several toes 
rather than the entire leg below the 
knee. a doctor had ant icipated 
before the treatment. The two other 
patients had \'enous and chronic 
arterial obstruction~ which have not 
responded a~ \\'ell to t he new 
treatment. 

The most recent of the se\'en 

patients to he treated was a Illall 
whose leg was endangered by a 
ma~~ive clot in an artery suppl) ing 
the limb. The artery. a bypass graft 
pre\'iously inserted into t hI:' leg to 
improve circulat ion, had dev loped a 
clot extending from the groin to the 
foot. In order to save t he leg. d(x·tors 
infused streptokinase directly into 
the clot. \Vithin 20 minutes, 
ci reu lat ion \\' 3~ part ially restored. 
Over the next 2·1 hours. the 
remainder of the c1llt di~appeared. A 
plug of fatty deposits in t he lower leg. 
behind which the dot had formed, 
was then open d with a balloon 
eath ter that "squashed" the 
deposits aga inst the \\ ails of the 
arten'. At.; circulation was restored. 
th leg regained its pink, healthy 
color and normal. warm temperature. 

Joseph Bookstein, M.D., the 
radiologist at UC D Medical Center 
w ho has been in\' estigating 
·treptokinase . ince the 1960·s. 
belie\'es potential uses for select ive 
infu ion of the drug are many. 
Among the mo t important may be 
emergency treat ment for myocardial 
infarctions (heart attacks), 
pulmonary emboli (clots in the lung), 
clot in arteries of the leg ', kidneys or 
intestines, and venous thromboses 
(c lots in the veins). 

Streptokinase ha been ~tud ied at 
UC D Medical Center and elsewhere 
since the 1960's, but because of 
conccrn. about its side effect. it was 
not rei ased by the FDA for general 
clinical use until 1979. It s greater 
avai labilit y after 1979 has enabled 
investigators to search for a safer 
means of administering th drug. 
The technique recently introduced at 
l 'CSD Medical Center grew out of 
pilot laboratory te~ts here.

The return of the Crimson King 
BY TED BURKE 

Some of us have mouthed our share of 
gripes about the occasionally ped trian 
fare that t he University Events Office has 
offered UCSD students over the last 
couple years, but now I'll eat my measure 
of crow and insist that such complaints 
must stop. Over the Fall Quarter, UEO 
has pI' se nt d some of the most 
interestingeventstooccurin an Diego in 
some time, including performances by 
Chick Corea, Firesign Theatre, comic 
Andy Kaufman . The Toshiko Akiyoshil 
Lew Tabaekin Big Band, and the Jeff 
Lorber Fusion. An impressive list as is . 
but now they continue their winning 
streak with a concert by the latest 
incarnation of the legendary King 
Crimson, playing this unday . 8 pm. in 
the l C D Main Gym. 

This is a concert for anyone interested 
in the expansive potential of rock. 
Founded and led through various 

en~emble make·ups by guitarist/ con· 
e ptualist Robert Fripp, King Crimson 
has be n one of the few truly musically 
revolutionary rock bands to come along. 
Often dumped together with 
"progressive" rock bands like Yes and 
Emerson. Lake and Palmer. Crimson ha. 
had a sound that stood alone, a sound. 
which to this dav. I' mains unmistakable 
and nearly imIX):'isible to imitate. 

Eschewing the boring virtuosity and 
mannered prissines~ that characterized 
the other bands. King Crimson rather 
concerned thems Ivcs with ideas of how 
to construct and re·shape sound. 
displaying a \\'illingness to take chances 
with untried areas. Past albuTll s like 
V,rh Tougue ill AsPic, Starlcss (llid Bible 
Black, and Red all demonst rate a 
consistent brilliance: a rivetting, off kilter 
r h y t h m sec t i () n m a i n t a i n i n g an 
abstracted hard rock pulse. Fripp'::, lyrical 
mcloncholie guitar work. layers of sound 

and texture building into beautifully 
realized tone poem s, and aero»" 
referencing of hea\y metal. funk, 
classical and t welve·tone l110t if s t hat all 
merge into a singular. mast erfull) 
constructed entity. 

Aside from Fran k Zappa (when he 
pe rform. music. not jokes for t he john) it" 
safe to say that King Cnmson stands a.., 
one of the most daring unit s to ever com 
along in rock, a band whose individuall..,m 
has, in a way, influenced new \\a\e 
artists I ike Talking Heads. Pere t 1))[1 and 
Vom . 

Performmg with Fripp will be a trio of 
su perlati\'e musicians. e;; peCi a lIy in the 
case of Bill Bruford. the former drummer 
for Yes and the be~t percussionist that 
King Crimson has had in its e\ er 
changing line up (he played on the 
aforementioned albums) Bruford is 
regarded as one oi the best rock

Chrichton strains to keep up 
with technology in 'Looker' 

BY JAY MARTINEZ 
Mi chael Chrichton graduat-

ed from the Harvard med 
school. but before he did he 
published a few short stories 
and a couple of longer ones and 
found out he enjoyed making 
more money at storie. than 
cutting people open _ He write" 
his storie on a fourteen 
thousand dollar Olivetti word 
processor _ A word processor is 
a computer which. in one pres 
of a ke\,. reduce~ what used to 
take a -writer hours - typing, 
editing, retyping - to 
milli econd _ lIe uses this 
technique in his new film , 
Looker. 

A writer working wi th a 
word processor might have the 
ultimat endeavor: he has at 
his fingertips a combination of 
a livelihood. a fantasy, and an 
Asteroids game. The comput er 
has made the job of story 
telling a lot easier. 

With so much money being 
pent every year by people 

playing video games, buying 
home computers and kids in 
grade school opt ing for 
computer programming 
versus music huurs, to make 
mO\'ies about this technology 
is a no-lose gamble for a 
co.ltemporary filmmaker. 

Chrichton's history is of 
pitting people against their 
own Ignorance. frustration, or 
greed in a toyland of 
computergraphics. Andro-
meda Straill was a lei ure 
re earch lab where computers 
sa'ved scientists from bouts of 
sleepine s. bugs and fl yi ng 

darts: in lVestwurid electronics 
enabled bored partici pants to 
fu lfill fanta sy by dodging 
computer strewn obstacl s (a 
relentless. shin y Yul Brenner); 
in COnla cadavers were 
pilferred through a computer-
ized organ-to-order fast cash 
program. 

Ten years ago Chrichton 
might have seemed pretty 
modern, The s tories of 
computers and the visual 
beauty of what they displayed 
was strik ing to an at,dlence 
entering a time of ~tereo ou t of 
th dark ages of monoaural. 

Chrichton now is antiqua-
ted for his sense of what the 
public has in lerms of 

o 

movies 
technology, condescending to 
an educated public. and 
\1uritanical at giving either his 
characters or the audience a 
second' thought of re pon i-
bility. 

[n Andromeda there was a 
tinge of wonder at the look of 
the movie for much of it was a 
virtual di 'play of computer 
generated imagery. This was 
match d by a low-key attitude 
of t he characters in the movie 
who used computers as many 
people used kitchen blenders. 
Chrichton was able to get the 
attitude of e1ailiness verv fast 
and in an unpretentious- way. 
This made it not on ly a 

~trained H.G. Wells vi'iion of a 
fast approaching realil\' for 

the audience, but made it 
brlievabl _ 

Looker has computers at the 
hands of advertising magnates 
who plan to use t hem to create 
a fool proof profi t scheme: 
mesmerizing a public into a 
buying mania. Chrichton's 
st rengt h in t he past has been 
how advanced his ideas of the 
I tthnology look. 

llere t hey look barely 
acceptable considering the 
U.S _ O lymp ic team is 
employing computer line 
analysis to improve execut ion 
of form (Loo!wr'sev ilcomputer 
has a hokey, nev('r fully shown 
replication of a model's 
audition on the beach for a 
commercial). Later, James 
Coburn as the ego eye-browed 
capitalis t. shows commercials 
fabricated out of recorded 
e1ata. They seem li feless and 
pushed for effect when you 
consider Franci Coppola is 
moving scenes and actors 
arou nd like digits in a video 
game or thaI Cal Tech has 
produced a nine minute movie 
on traveling through I he solCJr 
system from mathematica l 
information . 

Chrichton's sense of 
modernity holds little water 
al'!y longer .. He's competing 
WIth a conSClOusne s that is 
arguabl y into the knowledge of 
si licon chips while he still 
lingers on the fading tube. 

Th notion that televi 'ion is 
a new su bversive mechan ism

Two outlooks front 
two distinct bands 
New Ips from Black Flag and the Rats 

BY MIKEL TOOMBS 
Slaff Wriler 

Damaged 
Black Flag 
SST Records 

MCA Records di tribution 
pre ident AI Bergamo, in 
exp lai ning hi s compa ny' 
refusal to handle Black Flag's 
debut album, had this to say 
about Damaged: "As a parent 
wi t h two children, [found it an 
ant i-parent record, past the 
point of good taste. [listened to 
it all last weekend and it just 
didn't seem to have any 
redeem ing social value." 

He concluded , with great. 
unintentiona l und er s tate -
ment , "[t certainl y wasn't li ke 
Bob Dylan or Simon and 
Carfunkel and th things they 
were trying to say." 

Unfortunate ly, Damaged 
isn't as good as Mr. Bergamo 
makes it out to be, but it might 
prove rewarding lis tening. 
Provided , that is. you can find 
enjoyment - or amusement -
in rampagi ng moronity and 
unquestioning nihili sm. 

Black Flag is currently Los 
Angeles' most prominent 
repre entati ve of punk music, 
a form that has lost nearly al l 
its fre 'hness but, obviou Iy, 
not all it s appeal. The band's 
audie nce is compr ised of 
res lles middle-c lass sub-
urban yo uth, see king a 
musical al t rnative to heavy 

metal, aggressively looking for 
something more physical. 
more violent, more "real." 

Black Flag, to both its credit 
and debit, gives it fan 
precisely what they wa nl. (In 
that respect, the group i no 
different than t he "best" of the 
current heavy metal band : 
Van Halen, Oef Leppard and so 
on). Black Flag is an effect ive 
noise generator; its music i 
not very adept, but neither is it 
played a ll that badly. Its lyrics 
add li tt le to the impressions 
created by the song titles. such 
as " ix Pack ," "Thir ty and 
Miserable" (beer is con tantly 
referred to). "Gimmie Gimmie 
Gimmie" and" Padded Cell ." 

0, Black Flag doesn't have 
any "redeeming social value_ " 
With it s intelligence (· trongly 
hinted at in the album'. more 
humorous moments) it 
probably s hould . But is 
doesn't.

Refs fully trained by 1M dept 
BY LARRY GOLDMAN 

Staff Wril er 
Bot h the player!. and 
~t udent referees have \'oiced 
lheir opinions on the subject 
of int ramural referees . 
Ilo\\' '\'er, t he final decision 
on intramural refereeing 
come!> from the depart ment 
itself. What are the 1M 
director!> response to these 
\'iews? What is the procedure 
a st udent must go through to 
get hired as a referee? 

1M director~ MIke Hipp and 
Scott Berndes both have 
comments about student 
offIcials. The main thing 
emphaf>izeci is that t he 1M 
department's main goal is to 
have a ll participants in its 
program have the IJe!.t time 
possible. They want to be as 
fair as they can to all lcams 
and one way to do that is to 
g t t he best possible referee~. 

To get good referees there 
has to be qualified app licants 
but one also must have a good 
training program. According 
to Bernde"> I he referee 
program al UCSD is one of 
the most intensi\'e In the UC 
sys t em. 

To begin with, if a IJerson 
wants to be a !.tudent official 
he or shf' must ta lk to Hipp or 
Berndes during the 10th 
\\'eek of the quarter before 
you want to refcrce. Then 
during lhe first week of the 
next quarter you com to the 
1M office and find out the 
time and day of the first 
referee clinic.-

Thi" clinic is mandatory 
and lasts about t\\'o h()ur~, 
where the rule" of the sport 
are di~cu~~ed along WIth 
officiating In general. If you 
don't show up to thisyou will 
not be hired. 

Afler the first clinic you 
must come in and take a 
mandatorv te!.t. The test 
covers the ru les of t he sport 
and whatever else was 
co\'ered at the clinic. If you 
don't take the lest or do verv 
pmrly you won't be hired . -

Aft cr I he tesl t here is 
anolher mandatory clinic 
wher leams are aClual,,' 
fielded . The potent ia-I 
refcre 's are fed into the 
games on a rot at ing ba"i~ and 
when lh \' finish their !>hift 
thev are gi\'en pointers and 
told what t hey did wrong by 
t\\'o [M sUIJen'isors lhat were 
\\'atching them. 

The referees that ha\'e 
made il through lhis are 
hired. During the season, for 
lhe major "Ixlrts, the 1M 
supervi'i()r~ patrol games and 
try to keep quality at its best. 
Also there is a mid-season 
clinic \\ hich i~ basically a 
quest ion and answer period 
\I' here Ihe ~tudent officials 
di~cll~~ commonly mls~ed 
calls. 

A new rule which will be 
enacted starting next quarter 
i" to referee a sport you must 
have played t hat sport in 
lJCSD's program. The reason 
for this according to Hipp i'i 
lhal, "this\\'ayil will notjusl 
be a job for the officia I. He 
will ha\ e a reference point 
when making his calls." 

Both Hipp and Bernde~ 
agreed t hat I here are more 
problems \\,1 t h t he major 
sports than with the newer 
ones. The major sport~ are 
football. ba~ketball. and 
softball, and as lIipp !>aid, 
"e\'ery kid grcw up watching 
these sport s on TV so they 
think they know it all." 1n the 
newer ~Ixlrt-; like \'olleyball. 
",aterpolo, and ultimate 
frisbee t he pla~'Crs don't 
under~tand lhe rules as \\'ell 
so they argue less. 

AI.,o, ~ince the neRer 
sporh ha\e 'illlaller pro-
gram:. I he 1M depart men t IS 
a ble to hire experts to 
officiate the game~ and 
because of t his, the~e 'itudent 
officials get a I itt Ie more 
respect on their ca lls. 

On the slatemenl that 
three offiCIals would impro\'e 
the quality of football 
refereeing Hipp !-la id that il 

u~ed 10 be t he ca~e before t h ' 
budget cru nch t \\'0 yeilr" ago. 
II ipp :.aid, "we had to make a 
deci~i(Jn of elt her cutting 
back the referees or cutting 
back lhe number of leam" 
\I hich mean., not e\ ervone 
would get to partIcipate. 
Officiating ha~ "ufil'red to a 
dl'gre{' but t he affect was not 
too bad." 

Also on I he tOPIC that 
rderee~ had long ... hifh 
whICh madl' them ineffectl\'e 
Bernde" '>ald, ",not thaI many 
official" ha\ e four or fiH' 
hour shifts. !\." a rule I won't 
schedule a h'UY mOrt' than 
three game" in a 1'0\\." The) 
\\ ill let referees .,,\\ itch 
arou nd shift ... 'A' hlch may gl\'e 
one a longer shift lhan 
scheduled. 

When the su bjecl of I h 
abu-,e referees get \\ as 
brought up Berndl's "aid he 
has seen games \\ here a 
player h .. s dropped two 
touchdown passc~ and 
mis ... ed four ilags and then 
get on t Ill' referee for on e bad 
call. "The players act as If

On I he ot her hand B('rndes

Waterpolo finale 
BY VALERI S. ANDERS 

Scaff W riler 

Semi-final playoff action 
in AA intramural innertube 
waterpolo Monday night 
saw the undefeated team 
"SKLIF" defeat the 
previously undefeated team 
"Barriers to Entry" 23·10. 
SKLIF scored 11 times (5 of 
those by captain Dan Eby) 
before Barriers to Entry 
managed to get 1 pa t 
SKLIFS goalie Howard 
Grunloh . The game was 
never in doubt for SKLIF 
after that, and Barriers 
spent the evening trying to 
play catch-up. 

Although Barriers goalie 
Craig Kreeger missed 
several saves at the outset 
according to captain Steve 
Varney the whole team was 
at fault. "Our passing game 
was really bad, and our 
defen e, which is usually 
very good, broke down, It 
was aTl of us at fault." said 
Varney. 

SKLIFS goalie Grunloh 
played net for the entire 
game. making numerous 

aves and several key 
passes to his teammates, 

Bruce Landon , who 
scored the final SKLIF goal 
of the contesl, commented 
on the difficulty goalie 
experience in making 
crucial saves , "Goalies have 
next to no lateral move-
ment," said Landon. Adding 
that rest ricted movement i 
what makes the game of 
innertube waterpolo so 
difficult, though less 
physically demanding than 
regular waterpolo. 

In the Championship 
match next weeki SKLJF 
faces Foul Play who i also 
undefeated. 

Barriers to Entry vow to 
Come back next spring to try 
and take it all. SKLIF could 
win said Barriers to Entry 
captain Varney, "But in the 
past, Fou l Play has been the 
t earn to beat." 

The championship game 
between SKLlF and Foul 
Play will take place next 
Monday night at 8:00 p.m,

The B-52 will serve as a 
good model for these bands.

gonf' on to international fame

Chrichton's 'Looker' 
contin ued from page 14 
end of t he movie on how much 
the Am rican public watch s 
television in th cou r:e of a 
lifetime. 

As a theme (watching too 
much tel vision i ' bad for th 
health ), and coupled with the 
lone hero ( lbert Finn y) who 
saves th public from buying 
too much detergent, LOllker 
presents Chrichton as the 
savior of modern conscience. 
Tele\ ision and the effect it has 
on a buying public is probably 
all that hrichton says it will 
be. But it is also a distrusted 
and des pi sed channel of 
en tertainmcnt to an 0\' rindul -
ged audience. 

For all of his concern toward 
humanity , Chnchton has a 
puritanit:al stanc( toward the 
women . When they do ~ how

Chrichton has become a

In his worlds of people unable 
to compre hend how a
