They arc the Women's Re-
ource Center (WRC) and with 

all these program and events. 
one would think the are a com-
plex organization with an 
extremely large budget. Not o . 
At thi point, the WRC is made 
up of approximately 12 volun-
teers who have to work with a 
budget that is far below that of 
other UC campus WRCs. 

Because the WRC is a student 
organization, they submit budget 
proposals to the financial com-
mittee of the A sociated Student 
body (A.S.) . They also receive 
ome funding from SAAC. But 

the financial upport is limited 
and, with a small staff of volun-
teers, "just tryi ng to keep the 
doors open is so metimes kind of 
tough," said Li a Cauble, one of 
the three senior volunteers. 

"We are really limited in our 
energy and especially in our 
money compared to the other 
UCs. It' actually appalling," aid 
Barbra Blake, a nother senior 
vol unteer at the WRC. 

The 1986-87 U Federation 
Study, co nducted by UC Irvi ne, 
records the various budgets of all 
the UC WRCs and it shows that 
with approximately 12,000 tu-
dents at UCSD, the WRC's 
budget was $ 1,080, the lowest of 
all the C campuses. The next 
highe t budget belongs to UC 
Riverside . With only 6,970 stu-
dent, they a re allotted $95,238 . 
The re t of the numbers range 
from $103, 169 for UC Irvine's 
14,684 tudents to U LA' WRC 
which receives $168,3 16 for 
33,000 students enrolled. 

This large discrepancy in 
funding stems from the fact that

San Diego City Council

By PETER MESSROBIAN 
New.' Editor 

The an Diego City Council 
voted seven to two on Dec. 15 to 
deny Ogden Environmental Ser-
vice permis ion to operate a 
toxic waste incinerator in the 
Torrey Pines Mesa area, which 
adjoins UCSD. 

Over 200 people, nearly all 
opponents of the project , packed 
Council chambers to listen to 
testimony from both side and 
Council discu sion of the matter.

approval of the incinerator, pro-
ject opponent Diane Takvorian 
claimed in te timony before the 
council that the "E PA [Envir-
onmental Protection Agency] 
and DHS have poor record in 
combatting environmental prob-
lem ." Takvorian is the execu-
tive director of the Environmen-
tal Health Coalition (EHC), 
which supports the earch for new 
technologies to handle ha za rd -
ou waste but opposes Ogden's 
project in large part because of 

its experimental nature and it 
location . 

Ogden' lawyer. David Mul-
liken. attempted, during the 
council hearing, to narrow the 
co pe of the debate down to a 
ingle i sue .. " Is the CBC project 

an appropriate land u e? That i 
your domain [to decide that

council should defer to cientific 
expertise. "

watching" the debate in San

"no substantial evidence of a 
significant impact on the public 
health or the environment" from 
the incinerator.

At the final A.S. Council 
meeting of the quarter, $2,597 
was allocated to help tart a Stu-
dent Mediation Service, which 
will be located at Legal Service . 

T he Student Mediation Ser-
vice. without charge, will help 
students resolve di putes they 
have with other students. It's 
modeled after the Communit 
Mediation Program in an Diego 
and other program in the coun-
try where two parties agree to 
come together in front of a 
mediator. This trained volunteer 
will help the studen ts work out a 

compromise to their di pute. 

Already. a committee of inter-
e ted tudent and faculty i ' 
choo ing 15 student s to begin 
training at the beginning of this 
new quarter. They will be from a 
wide range of campu perspec-
tives . "The mediators will get 
life-time skills and they will en-e 
a ' role model for people coming 
in otheycan olvesimilarprob-
lems in the future." explained 
Thomas Walsh, a re ident advi-
sor at Muir and a principle 
advocate of the new ervice . 

Pres ntl . there i no o n-
campu se rvice for students to 
resolve a connic t they are having 

with other ' tudent s. They ca n go 
to the re ident hall advisors, but 
they are overloaded with student 
problems . 

Legal Ser ice can't advocate 
one student against another 
because of the connict of inter-
est. At least five tudent a week 
come to Legal Services for help 
with a student ve rsus student 
connict and are turned away.

An unusual aspcct is that most of

emphasis on education for prevention 
of t he spread of the disease. The grant 
represcnts a unique co lla borat ive

appropriateness of the research to the 
communit ies that are a high risk and 
provide expertise for carrying it out. 

Some 50 researchers including 
epidemiologists. bchavioral scientists

High tech turns religious 

Author preaches the good 
word for computer hackers 
By KAREN K UMM 
Staff Writt'r 

I noticed Jeffrey Armstrong 
the minute I walked into the 
UCSD bookstore ; after all , a 
man with an electric tie pin and a 
computer chip stuck to his fore-
head tends to stand out in a 
crowd. Armstrong was in the 
bookstore on Dec . 2 1 to auto-
graph copies of his new book, 
The Binary Bible. 

Armstrong, also known as 
" Saint $ilicon," is the founder of 
CHIP, the Church of Heuristic 
In formation Process ing. a new 
high-tech religion . A former 
computer salesman, he is also a 
tand-up comedian and song-

writer. 
Armstrong claims that CH IP 

is an actua l religion . Founded in 
1984. the religion helps followers 
recover from using computers; 
providing the right balance 
between humanity and technol-
ogy. Armstrong trave ls a round 
the country giving "se rmons" to 
the "da ta weary," primarily indi-
viduals in the computer industry. 

H is religion i ba sed on puns, 
in fact our whole conversa tion 
was in puns. Armstrong said that 
CHIP is neither left nor right . 
nut "light." The church's motto 

---

is "lighten up ." He said that most 
religions can lead to overly 
se riou thinking and that his 
church has so mething to teach 
both religion and sc ience . Ilis 
church is there to help people 
understand humilit y and open-
ness in today's computer age . 
The ultimate goal of a CHI P fol-
lower is to achieve "nerdvana ." 
Armstrong. with tongue in cheek, 
refers to other well-known reli-
gions as "Geek orthodox" and 

Armstrong was 
worki ng late one 
night when a bolt 
of lightning struck 
the satellite dish 
on his roof. 

"Cathode1ics. " 
The question that Armstrong 

asks his followers is about the 
relationship betwee n love and 
logic. He ha s a formula to define 
thi s relationship : love-sq uared 
plus logic eq ua ls intelligent life . 
What he st ill que tions is just 
how thi ba la nce ca n be found . 

Arm trong explains that in 
today's society we forget the real 
use for technology. which is to 
make us happy. Computers sur-
vey and control us. and we must 
not lose sight of this unfortunate 
fact, he said . Being ca rbon-based 
entities rather than silicon-based 
like computers, we are" ilico n-
sapie ns." To understa nd what's 
going on wi th new techn ology 
and to keep ourselves from 
becoming an endangered species 
we must get a sense of humo r 
and perspective about com puters. 

Th e Binary Bible provid es th is 
perspecti ve, and is loaded with 
humor, and of course. pun s. One 
of Saint Silicon's praye rs is" Hai l 
Memory":" Hail memory, full of 
space, the M othe r Board i wi th 
thee. Bles ed art thou among 
Micros. and blessed is the Fruit 
of th y Processo r -data . H oly 
Memory, M o th er Board of 
ROM , pra y for us begi nners, 
now and at the hour we sign off. 
Enter." Those versed in compu-
ter lingo will be able to catch all 
the puns in thi s book. but even 
those who arc not com puter-
literate ca n find am ple humor 
j ust by marvelling a t how Arm -
tro ng ha managed to alter th e 

bible that we are all familiar 
with . 

Although some people may 

'UNIVERSfI'Y BOOKSTORE 

think that a religion based on 
computers and humor is a sacri -
lege. Armstrong denies it - he 
prefe rs to call it " hackrilege." 

The birth o f Saint Silicon is 
most unu sual. Armstrong said 
he was working late one night at 
his Macintosh when a bolt of 
lightning struck the satellite dis h 
on the roof of his house. Ren-
dered unconscious, he awoke to 
find th e "Keyboard Praye r" 
printed on the scree n naming 
him Saint $ilicon . His me ntor is 
G .O .D " the Giver of Data. CH I P

friend Iy religion ," Armstrong 
said . 

In fact. it wa s G.O.D . that 
instructed "Saint Silicon" to run 
for president in the upcoming 
1988 pres idential elections . 
Armstrong' party is the Tech-
nocrats. He says that it is about 
time we had a computer-literate 
president. He claims that the 
Star Wars issue is actually a 
software issue and could easily 
be understood by a co mputer-
literate pre ident.

undcr sexua l harrassme nt a nd 
essentia ll y wha t you get is a 
number for a tape recording." 
said Cartwrigh t. 

Cauble discussed women 's 
concern for their persona l safety. 
especially at nig ht. "Women have 
a false sense of securi ty [on the' 
UCSD ca mpus] and then realize 
that " I don't fee l so safe here. 
The lighting isn't so great. It 's 
creepy here after it gets dark," 
said Cauble. 

Las t year, the ad ministra tion 
add re sed the e issues with a 
Women's Needs Survey. Watson 
formed the Wo men's Advisory 
Com mittee (W AC) to write, dis-
tribute. and record responses 
from the survey a nd then make 
recommendations concern ing thc 
need s of women o n cam pus. 

"Concerns werc being raised, 
it was felt t hat there should be a 
means of addressing those con-
cerns objective ly, of assessi ng 
what the views of the fema le stu-
dents a t UCSDwereandwe then 
proceeded that way to have such 
a n assessment." said Watson . 

And yet the women a t the 
WRC feel that the survey was 
inconclusive. "You cou ld have 
taken the same survey and ta r-
geted any populalion you wa nted 
and you would have gOlle n the 
same res ult s because it was so 
ge neral." said Cartwright. " I 
understa nd the need nOI to lead 
the survey. but then the survey 
cOll It! tr.rYe -beerr for McDo -
ald·s ." 

Watson responded , "As a sur-
vey. it was done as acc urate ly as 
these things are. It went to all 
women students on ca mpus." 
With a 30 percent response rate, 
Watson said. "Under mosl ci r-
cumstances one co nsiders that a 
very va lid survey." 

Watson ack nowledged the fact 
that both the Women's Ca ucus 
(co mpri sed of faculty a nd sta ff) 
and the W RC responded unfa-
vora bly to the survey. 

T he WAC did , however. make 
their recom mendations to Wat-
so n. based on Ihe survey res ult s. 
T hey fo und problems with cam-
pus lig hting and, with Ihe dis-
semination of informa ti on 
regarding women services and 
activities. Also apparent was a 
stro ng concern for personal 
safe ty on cam pus. 

Mary Virga. a member of the 
WAC a nd a part of the Student 
Safety Awareness Program, said 
t hat lighling was improved 
throughout va riou s areas of 
campus and the issue of personal 
safety has been addressed . The 
Student Safety Aware nes Pro-
gram was formed to address the 
areas of rape prevention and 
educa tion. sexua l harass ment. 
and personal safety. 

Although this program may 
look good on paper. the WRC 
fee ls that in realit y the difference 
tra nslates int o less people doing 
more work. Blake said. "They 
[th e administration] won't 
cx pa nd the resou rees . They j ust

ready ha ve and the re~ources

gram co nsists onl ofa minor 
there is no major. or a regular 
class curricul um . 

According to Bla ke it's ex-
tremely d ifficult to e\en get a 
minor. "They just don't offer the 
clas~es . Therc's no sort of cohe-
sion, no act ual department you 
can \\-alk into . There'~just a fe\\ 
women faeult) members from 
different departments ." 

And when people call long-
distance to the WRC to find out 
about the non-existent Women's 

tudies Department. "it' a bad 
reflection on t he univer~it}," ~aid 
Cart" right. 

Rcynolds said that because 
there is "considerable faeult \' 
i ntere~t a nd build i ng ~t uden-t 
i ntere~t." the progra m ha~ hope~ 
of expanding with a defined 
seq uence of co ur~c, directly 
related to the minor and ma\'bc 
c\ en in finding a full-time fac~lty 
member for the program . But. 
that i~ in the future . 

To address many ofthe;.c i~sue, 
no\\. a ne\\ committee i being 
formed. the Commillee on the 

tatu~ of Women. which will be 
comprised of 15 member~ : two 
students. four faculty member;. 
and the rest staff. rhe WRC 
\ olunteers said that becau,e 
approximately 50 percent of the 
student popUlatio n i~ female. 
\\ith only t\\O tudent member, 
on the new committee. female 
student will only be getting 
about 12 percent repre entation. 
As a result they are trying to 
increase the number of ~tudent' 
10 four. 

The fact that the WAC is now 
defunct and that the name of the 
Commission on the Statu~ of 
Women was changed by Chan-
cellor Atkin on to the Commit-
tee on the tatus of Women 
implies to the women at the 
WR C that the,e committee had. 
and have . very lillie power and 
even uggest tha t both commit-
tees are possibly poli t ical move, 
on the part of th e admi nistratio n 
to " pacify" the student popula-
tion . 

Watson said. "I think when 
t he cha ncellor se ts up a task 
force of the Status of Wome n, 
he's not d oi ng it to save face . 
He's d oing it to get information 
in order to make j ud gments a nd 
to better admi nistert he cam pus." 

And . accord ing to Virga , t he 
cha nging of the name of the 
present com mittee was o n ly a 
tec hn ical change beca use most 
groups like this one are ca lled 
committees. T he important fact. 
Vi rga said , is t hat " there was no 
commissio n committee fo r the 
S ta tus of Wo men a t UCS D and 
now there is . It 's goi ng to have a 
big im pact a nd t hat 's good ." 

T he pro posed fu nction of the 
committee is to be an advisory 
com mittee to the cha ncellor and 
to address variou wome n's issues 
such as the Wo men 's Studies 
Program and the pro posal of a 
staff per on at the WR C. 

Fo r the wo men at the WRC, 
they ho pe tha t their d oubt ~abou t

the perfect candidate for a guest

is bei ng considered for both

Armstrong, 41. li ves ip Santa 
Cruz with his wife and ten-year· 
old daughter. He holds degrees 
in psychology, creative writing

Tritons in action over break 
JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

Swimmin& 
On aturday, Jan , 2, the men's 

and women' swim teams hosted 
and won the annual six-team 
UCSD Invitational. A men' and 
women' core of 1,328 points 
put them well over second place 
fini shers Wyo ming University 
(1072,S) third place Air Force 
(979 ,5). 

The Triton women were led by 
Jenna Banaszek a nd Crystal 
Konno who each won two races 
to give the women 669 point for 
the day and seco nd place among 
the other women team . Banas-
zek won the SOO-meter freestyle 
in 5:09 .99, then swam the anchor 
leg for the 400-meter freestyle 
relay team. which won in 3:44.88. 

Konno swam the 100-meter 
breaststroke in I: I 0 .89 and the 
200-meter butterfly in 2:09 .94 
for her two victories , 

Other Triton women who won 
events were Christy Parker (SO-
meter freestyle. 25 .31), Alice 
Kirby (200-meter breaststroke. 
2 :33 .80) and Julie Rankine 
(1.6S0-meter freestyle, I :2S . II) . 

teve Denyf also won two 
events to help give the men's 
team 6S9 points and thirlj place 

among the competing men 's 
team . Dcnyf took the 100-meter 
freestyle in a time of 48.3 econd s. 
then swam anchor on the win-
ning 400-meter freestyle relay 
team (3: 12,71). 
Basketball 

Over the last few days of 1987, 
the women' basketball team 
hosted its annual tournament, 
the Coca-Cola C1as ic. where 
their disappointing season 
continued. 

The Tritons went 1-2 for the 
three-day tournament putting 
their record at 3-8. On Monday, 
Dec . 28, the women faced the 
University of Wisconsin, losing 
74-53 . (Wisconsin finished as the 
runner-up of the tournament, 
losing to t. Ambrose College 
92-S6 in the final ). 

Pla yi ng in the consolation 
bracket, the Triton women de-
feated the college of otre Dame 
in the first round of competition 
67-43. In the consolation finals. 
the women were not so lucky. 
losing to Cal State University 
San Bernardino 66-54. 

The men 's basketball team was 
quite busy over the winter break 
going 2-2 over t he three week 
period. putting their record at 
6-4 . 

On Dec. 14, the I riton faced 

Christian Heritage Uni versi ty at 
home. Even with the 19 points 
for Tim Rapp and 14 rebound s 
from senior ce nter Andy Jed y-
nak, UCSD lost 73-86. 

UCSD then went o n the road 
for three games tarting with a 
70-63 revenge win over the Uni-
versity of Redia nds. Redlands 
had defeated the Triton in the 
finals of their tournament (on 
Dec . 19) a week before. so the 
win was important to the Tritons 
ranking . Kevin S tewart led the 
Tritons with 13 point a nd 9 
rebounds. 

"Stewart has been incredible 
th is year,"said Triton head coach 
Tom Marshall. " I'm rea ll y 
pleased with his con istent play," 

Stewart con tinued his consis-
tency over th e next two games 
leading the Tritons in scoring for 
both games. Afterthewinagain t 
Redla nds . UCSD had a disap-
pointing loss against Claremo nt-
Mudd which could co me back to 
haunt them when the drive for a 
playoff positio n begins. Stewart 
had 23 points and Jedynak had 
II rebounds in the 7S-8 1 loss. 

Marshall was most impressed 
with the Tritons 69-61 win over 
Point Lorna Nazzarene on Dec.
