The AS propo al for a beer pub on campus is now in the final 
stages of preparation after " treading water" for the past three ' 
weeks, according to Gary Moser, one of Muir College's AS 
repr sentatives . 

The contract for a restaurant and beer and wine pub in Building .

Day care: who ·will foot bill?

could effectively run a puh. 

Future Foods decided ,

According to the Commis-

The children considered the 
day care demonstration by 
their parents to be a party 
nobody ever expected. They 
chased around the large 
conference table and climbed 
through the spaces in Chan-
cellor McElroy's desk. They 
drew pictures on the chalk 
board. 

Three-year-old Ariel Gion 
said , " If the Chancellor chops 
day care down , I'll blacken his 
eyes." 

Parent Mike Gibbs called the 
protest, " A theatrical event to 
match the walk out staged by 
the Chancellor. We want him to 
see the parents are committed. 
That man walked out in anger, 
picked up his toys and left." 

and McElroy wants day care. 
The unresolved question 
remains - Who will subsidize 
day care and at what level of 
quality? 

The Chancellor points out, " If 
we contract with the best 
outside agency available, the 
campus will provide a day care 
service at the best standard the 
community has to offer.'!.. The 
parents believe that it is 
essential to continue with 
something better than the 
community standard: " Day 
care at a decrea ed quality is 
no care at all." 

Elizabeth Birchfield com-
mented , " The university is 
supposed to function as a 
leader, facilitate education for 
all people and raise the 'quality 
of life. Day care raises the

the benelit is small when

It costs money to maintain a 
model program with a degree 
of quality above and beyond 
community standards. If we 
are to continue for our children 
the type of day care education 
that we have become accus-
tomed to and have learned to 
value, the money must come 
from some place . 

Money should be the tool with 
which priorities are set. It must 
be recognized that the day care 

.center represents a lifeline to 
an entire class of parents who 
would be unable to pursue their 
education or their jobs without 
it. Beyond money, we hav€. 
before us a question of social 
consciousness. 

The Chancellor is th 
figurehead for the university 
and his support for day care 
must be vigorously pursued. 
But one must look beyond 
McElroy to the groups that 
control pots of money on the 
campus and could set a priority 
for day care. 

Where is the support from the 
Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs? Where 
is the support from the 
Associated. Student!!? Both 
groups control large budgets 
created by student fees . 

Moser is in the proces or. 
developing a Procedural 
Package for the restaurant and 
pub that will cover background, 
costs, procedures, limitations 
and the need for the pub to have 
a $5 million liquor liability 
policy. 

Once the package is accepted 
by the Student Center Board the 
bidding for the pub will begin . 
The bidding will be open to 
anyone, including students who 
can find backers. A rating scale 
will be used to determine who 
will get the contract and once 
the contract is awarded it will 
require 30 days before the pub 
will open. 

The layout of Building C will 
include a cordoned-off area for 
the pub. Only those who are 21 
or over will be allowed into the 
pub area . C11rrently, about half 
of the student population is 21 or 
over and including staff and 
faculty the figure comes close 
to 70 percent. 

No one will be allowed to take 
alcoholic drinks out of the pub 
area . If the alcohol license is 
violated the penalty would be 
cessation of services in the pub 
for one year until the license 
can be renewed . 

The opening of Future Foods 
in ~he first week of next quarter 
will be "the beginning for the 
AS to open more ervices in the 
Student Center," said Moser. 
"Students de erve a lot more 
than they are getting here."

According to Eisen, another 
po sible controversy concern-
ing the Comm.Board is how it 
will fund each medium with its 
limited amount of money. 

Ei en ha proposed that the 
board consi t of five members 
appointed by the AS, as he feels 
a mall group would tend to 
wo rk harder . In contrast, 
Hawkins believes there should 
be a larger board, including one 
represe nta ti ve from each 
campus medium. 

Hawkins argues that each 
medium claims to have 
expertise in communications 
and should have some say in 
their own fate , whereas Eisen 
says he and the AS don 't feel 
that each medium should have 
a vote on the Comm Board, as 
this would most likely result in 
five newspapers trying to gain 
on one another. 

Elsen said the task force is 
con idering writing into the 
consitution the criteria for 
fu nding each medium. 

.. A solution to the problem of 
limited money would be to have 
each medium provide 25Cft:. of its 
own funds through fund rai ing

ox of the CIA 
by Jeffrey Slel. 

Paelfle News Service 
shlngton, D.C. - The Justice Department's breach of 

COlO ct ' suit against former CIA analyst-turned-author Frank 
Sne p hangs ' on "a very slim reed," says the embattled Snepp, 

3u~r of the recent book Indecent Inlerval. 
Tile suit, filed at the urging of CIA Director Stansfield Tumer, 

ch::u'le8 Soepp with violating his CIA secrecy oath by writing an 
unauthorized and highly critical account of the agency's 
performance in the last days of the Vietnam War. 

Snepp rontenda tbat tile IeCrecy oath, which aU CIA agents are 
required to take, will probably not stand up in court. That belief,.he 
revealed In an interview, is based on the fact that Turner asked 
him to sign a second secrecy pledge last year when it was learned 
he was writing the book.

Day care decision "a 'blunder"

Snepp said that last May 24 CIA deputy general counsel John 
Morrison wrote to him and asked him to sign the second secrecy 
agreement. " I wrote back," said Snepp, "and asked, 'If the first 
one is valid, why do I have to sign a second one? You're confusing 
me, and would you please explain this anomaly? '" The agency 
never replied, said Snepp. 

" That convinced me that, first of all, the secret agreement from 
their point of view was a very slim reed on which to hang 
anything ... It seemed to indicate to me that the first one wasn't 
very valid. 

" I figured ," he added, " that they were trying to entangle me in 
all sorts of legal particulars, and it was at that point that I said to 
hell with them, they' re not going to get their hands on my 
manuscript.' , 

AUy. Gen. Griffin Bell has indicated that the suit is intended to 
test the legal force of the standard secrecy oath. " If you enter into 
a written solemn contract and breach it, that's a serious 
matter," said Bell. 

His comments seemed to indicate that the suit may be aimed at 
a boarder concern than just the Snepp book. CIA Director Turner 
is known to be concerned about a possible flood of CIA books 
written by numerous agents who are soon to be dismissed from the 
agency's Clandestine Services Division. Many of the agents, 
angered by Turner's brusque handling of the staff reductions, 
have already threatened to write revealing books that may violate 
the secrecy oath. . . 

Snepp dismissed the notion that the suit against him could 
prevent publication of other books. " It won't matter to them (the 
other agents) what's happened to me," he said . " People who write 
books will be motivated by their resentment of Turner." 

. Atty . Gen. Bell contends the oath is now a prior restraint on 
freedom of speech. "He didn't have to take the job," Bell told 
reporters . " That's not censorship . There's no involuntary 
servitude in this country ." 

Snepp countered that, "When you join the agency you sign away 
your right to protest things you learn about only lateron and what 
kind of contract is that? To me, it's a falacious kind of ~ontract. " 

Both men agreed that the oath should be tested in court. " We 
might as well know" if it's not valid , said Bell . 

Snepp also charged that former CIA Director William Colby and 
others have tried to tarnish his pubic image since the highly 
publi cized book appeared last December. " Colby has very 
cleverly been leaking stories that I worked for the Phoenix 
program ... to blow my credibility with anybody in the center or left 
of center," said Snepp. " Operation Phoenix" was a controversial 
mass assassination program run by Colby in Vietnam. Snepp, a 
top .analyst on communist strategy, did not work for the program. 

Snepp said he had decided to publish his book without CIA 
authorization after he was blocked from writing an inter·agency 
account while still an employee . He said he concluded that U.S. 
officials were leaking to the press distorted versions of South 
Vietnam 's collapse which were favorable to themselves. 

" I can understand if you leak to a journalist to promote a 
diplomatic initiative ," he said, " but to do so for personal and 
politica l reasons .. .is an abuse of the secrecy system, and that 's 
what J object to." 

Snepp charged in his book that when Saigon fell to the North 
Vietnamese, the CIA, among other things , abandoned 70 percent of 
some.90,OOO agents; failed to burn its secret files , thus exposing the 
names of agents to the North Vietnamese; and left behind $250 
million in gold bullion. He also charged that top embassy CIA and 
administration officials had been easily tricked into believing a 
negotiated settlement was in the making.

-Day care

.'myopic' 
Editor: 

The recent' decision by the 
Chancellor to Carm out UC day care 
to a commercial business is an 
example of administrative myopia. 
The decision ;nay save the 
university some money, but the 
quality o( day care will suffer. A 
recent survey «(all '77) indicated 
there was need for on·campus day 
care facilities. 

, 
Rather than make any real 

commitment to this need, the 
Chancellor, on the advice of the 
business o(fice, has elected to opt 
out. As a result, the present day 
ca re system which provides a 
model environment for teaching 
and (or ca ring will be replaced by a 
business enterprise of unknown , 
and nece arily"inferior quality. 

Other UCs have university 
operated day care facilities . For 
some reason UCSD prefers to 
remain in the back wa ters of 
community services. One wonders 
why there is so much apparent 
concern (or landscaping and 
grounds (have you ever pondered 
the number o( workers who spend 
35 hours per week grooming the 
lawns ?) when McElroy is so 
concerned about reducing the cost 
of the one service which makes 
affirmative actio n and equal 
opportunity policies something 
more than rhetoric. 

The questionable priorities of the 
business office should not be 
imposed on the rest o( us .

image , but an image is something else 
of its own, and that only a small, 
symbol·mirror is necessary to suggest 
" through the looking glass." I would 
not have done it that way. What is 
important in " The Balcony" is what is 
in front of the mirror and the reflection 
in the mirror. All I could see in this 
mirror was the tops of heads. 

Another c harming device for 
obscuring rea lity and illusion are the 
dress-up costumes of the bishop, the 
judge, the general a nd the police chief. 
When they struggle in and out of these 
mammoth things they a r e like

however, are the gigantic shoes in

which give them a sort of mythic

d ive rsions a nd the soothing Villa· 
Lobos music at intermission (thanks 
to sound designer James Lebrecht) I 
think 1 might have gone mad. (If I had 
it probably would have been a point in 
Genet's favor.) 

The acting - well , I'm biased . I like 
Valerie Shanks a lot, and 1 would have 
hel' play a ll the female roles. The 
audience is short·changed by seeing 
her only in the smallis h role of

beauty and a fine mastery of her

it 's easy to drop times." 
However, the 14th place finish 
came as a surprise to him. " We

UCSD can realistically finish in

Hernandez, a Biology major 
from Los Altos. said it was 
mainly a personal thing but he 
was proud to represent the 
school. " I just did~' t know how 
they'd (UCSD) react, " he said. 
Allen, a Third College biology 
major. agreed the swim team's 
performance " gives the school 
a good name." 

Morgan also said, " What 
really impressed me was that

With the help of both the bat and the arm of UCSD's pitcher, 
Eileen McGirr, the women's softball team won their second 
straight game this season. defeating the Taft College Cougars 
last Friday, 14-0 . 

McGirr pitched a one-hitter and allowed only four walks 
during the seven innings of the game. while striking out nine 
Cougars. 

The name of the game for the Triton offense was walk. TaCt's 
pitcher allowed 13 walks in the first six innings, and the relief 
pitcher who was brought in at the beginning of the seventh 
inning allowed two more. UCSD also amassed nine hits , 
including a triple in the third inning by Alma ' 'Moose" Edwards 
and a pair of doubles, in the fifth and the sixth innings, by 
McGirr. 

The only time McGirr 's shutout was in jeopardy was in the 
fourth inning, when Taft loaded the bases on two walks and a 
highly contested bunt. which turned out to be the team's only 
hit. The next two Cougars to come to the plate struck out. and 
the third batter grounded out easily to third base. 

Friday's victory was the second in as many games for the 
UCSD women . They defeated Mesa College on Feb. 23, 8-1 , on 
another one-hitter by McGirr. All other games scheduled for 
winter quarter were rained out. . 

" In their first two games , the team has been playing 
outstanding ball ," commented UCSD women 's softball coach 
Chuck Millenbah after the game. "Today's game was a total 
team erfort."

ruling on the Ray motion . 
Ironically, Judge Battle was 
found slumped over his desk top 
with Ray's petition beneath

As Lane reads it, Statute 17-
117 is so $pecific that it alone 
would be enought to guarantee 
Ray his first full-length public 
hearing into the evidence of the 
case. Lane's staff is currently 
preparing the motion for a new 
trial. 

• 'If the law of Tennessee is 
respected by the courts of 
Tennessee, then Ray will get a 
new trial," Lane said. "If he 
does, we are confident he will 
be acquitted,"

Some would contend that 
Friday's demonstration by day

that the Chancellor will support 
day care. I don' t think that's the 
case. If McElroy holds to his 
commitment there will be a 
day care service. But, if we are 
to maintain ex c eptional 
standards, support will have to 
come from faculty , students 
and staff.
