Lowell plan!. to rea li/e the sav-

lihrari es. 

"This is the first time the lihrary 
has ever conducted a major pro-
gram matic redu 'ti on," Lowell said. 
"We were very fortunate to he ahle 
to do thiS without layoffs." 

Only one person has heen laid 
off in the history of the lihrary ~y~­
tem, Lowe ll said. An employee, 

whose pos ition \ as e liminated, 
chose being laid off over reassign-
ment to ensure preferential rehiring 
status. 

According to Lowell, four of the 
eight po~itl(lns to be eliminated are 
currently lilled. Lowe ll said those 
employees, who were all aware 
their positions were in jeopardy,

CLONING'S CONSEQUENCES

to reduce the information desk' to a 
~i nglc pe~on 'whenever pos,ible,' 
and is looking into staffing it with 
volunteers during peak periods. 

Lowell also said he hopes to 
institute a $3 fcc for Library 
Express, the free service that 
allows faculty and graduate stu-
dents to request library materials 
for delivery. 

The fcc would only apply to the 
dcli very of hooks and other 1110no-
graphs, because the libraries cur-
rent Iy charge for copies of journals. 

The fcc is slated to take effect 
on July I. Lowell said opposition 
from the academic senate may 
delay its implementation . 

Lowell also hopes to save up to 
$30,000 per year by allowing full -
time library staff members to cut 
hack thei r working hours by 10 
percent and hy increasing the usc 
of part-time career positions. 

InfoPath , which is currentl y 
supported primarily with library 
funds , is another source of potential 
savings. Lowell plans to ask cam-
pus offi cials to increase their fund -
ing hy $94,000 per year, to 
$14X,OOO - the amount of 
fnfoPath acti vi ty not currentl y 
re lated to the lihrane,.

Few library employees would 
comment on the reductions, either 
on or off the record . Those that did 
were generally supportive of 
Lowell and the cuts. 

"I think it's wonderfu l there 
weren ' t any layoffs," one informa-
tion desk stalTer said. "There have 
never heen any layoffs. and I think 
that 's a tribu te to good manage-

"The most surprising thing to

WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF WARD CONNERLY? 
Interviews by Grace Jang • Photography by Claire Schneider 

don ' t I i I.e 
Connerly. He\ a puppet for 
Pete Wibon. He'll go along 
wi th whatever the rcgent~' 
most reactionary position 
is. He\ really di~tant with 
the students - sponsori ng 
the ant i-affi rmative action 
bill for Pete Wi lson, [But] 
just because he's bl ack and 
anti -affiml ati ve action does 
not instantly make it a 
racial Issue, Affi rmative 
action extends way beyond 
black and white. He also 
had something to do with 
no students being on the 
new student regent selec-
tion committee, He should 
be booted,

Continued from page 9 
she added. 

Another program that help, 
loca l underprivileged Junior high 
and high ,chool student .. IS the 
Early Acadelllic Outreach Program 
(EAOP) at UCSD, a collaboration 
hetwccn the uni versity and more 
than 70 ,choob in the San Diego 
and Im perial Countie,. 

Though EAOP has many 

component programs to help 
underprivi leged siudents, one of the 
more well known i~ pward Bound, 
a national program aimed at low-

m~ome, potential fin'lt -generation 
college- bound high- school ~tudents. 

~aid Julianna Rodriguc/, director of 
EAOP Upward Bound at UCSD. 

pward Bound hirc\ 50 UCSD 
\lUdent~ to IUlor and mentor a IOtal 
of 70 high-sc hool siudents per 
academic year, Rodriguez said. 

The high school students also 
rccci vc personal and career 
counseling, S.A.T. workshop~, 
personal-enrichment program~ and 

The UCSD Guardian 

an opportunity to participate in the 
five- week Upward Bound Summer 
Re~idential Program at CSD. 

In the summer program, 
participant, ~ tay at UCSD for live 
weeks and take classes - primarily 
math, Engh,h and science. 

Upward Bound I, al,o a part of 
the group of national programs 
collec tively known a, Trio Program;,. 
an umbrella group funded through 
the Higher Education Act of 1965 via 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
The OIher two Trio programs at 
UCSD are Student Support Services, 
under OAS.I.S ., and the Ronald E. 

Me air a adem ie-enrichment 
program,>, Rodriguel ~aid . 

While organi/.ers of these various 
academic-outreach program, agree 
that the,e ~e rV l ce, arc crucial to the 
educa tional opportunities of 
econolTIl ca ll y- disadvantaged 
\tudenh. the questi on of which 
method is hcst remains unanswered. 

Asked how the UCSD Charter 
High School would contribute to 
academiC outreach. Rodriguez said 
the charter school will allempt to do 
what Upward Bound already docs. 

Last year, all the Upward Bound 
graduates ente red college. she

added. Rodriguez says she expect~ 
~imilar results thi s year. 

"There should be a spectrum of 
outreach ~ctivities," uthcrland 
said. "[The UCSD Charier High 
School I should he a solution. not 
the \o lution, to C outreach." 

According to Swanson, 
however. educator ... ncell to lind a 
~ lIlglc approach and stick with it. 

"What I hope wc don't have is 
a proliferation of a lot more 
outreach programs," ,he aid. " We

TRACK: UCSD 
excels at Aztec Invite 
ContlRued from page 20 
hurdles , in wh ic h Kirk Miller, Matt 
Amero and Tim Prudence finished 
2nd through 4th. Miller narrowly 
missed the provisiona l qualifying 
mark for Nationals. but with all three 
continuing to improve, having the 
trio qualify in future events is a 
definite possibility . 

In the sprinting events, the men 
were paced by freshman Andrew 
Gonzales, a San Jose product, who 
placed second in hi s heat of the 200 
meter and narrowly missed hi s per-
sonal hest in the I 00 meter. 

The heartbreak of the meet for 
UCSD came in the 5000 meter, 
where junior Neal Harder took con-
trol of the race at the two- mile Illark 
and led with only I 00 meler~ n: -
mainlng. Point Loma'~ David Koi/ ,

On the women'sside, in addition 
to Shepard's performance, sopho-
more Maggie Dwire continued to

chalking up a seasonal best mark of

missing a qualifying time.

AWARDS: Oh, 
here comes Walsh 
Continued from page 20 
basketball center Matt Aune. This 
guy owned opposing centers on 
hi way to racking up a third-
straight YCI\f of impressive statis-
tics. 

Even though the Tritons were 
eliminated from postseason play, 
Aune again led them in both scor-
ing and rebounding and went for 
as many as 40 points in one game 
this season. Also, if you haven't 
noticed, thi s guy is pretty big and 
I'm not about to have him come 
after me for an explanation on 
why he didn't win . 

Surprise Team Perfor-
mance. 

Men's vo lleyba ll. 
They're not a winter sport you 

say? Well , they've played over 
half their schedule this winter and 
I'm calling the shots, so they get 
the award. Without a doubt, thi s 
team has been the most fun to 
watch. 

Well , maybe that 's a little bi-
ased because I cover them, but 
they have upset two top- 10 team 
and look like they could win the 
first-ever Divi sion III National 
Championship. Plu ,there's noth-
ing more exhil arating then watch-
ing one of our guys fire a ki II off

this would be the sport for me. 
Most Impressive Team 

Combo. 
Men's volleyball and women 's 

basketball. 
These two teams combined to 

win the first annual Triton Swim-
Off, an event that combined a 
men's and women's non-aquatic 
team in a freestyle relay . Honor-
ab le mention goes to the men' s 
golf team, which made it through 
the race without having any of

Well , there they are: the win-

No.1 Ranked BYU is Immune to Upset Fever 
VAC~INATION: Facing th~ top-ranked team in .the na~ion and riding a string of strong performances 'against Divi ion I teams, 
the Tntons were unable to mfect the Cougars with theIr recent upset fever and were swept in three straight games on Friday 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The thing aho ut upset victories is that 
they are like a had cold, once a team gets 
one into its ~ys tem they arc very tough to 
shake. Now imagine that thi s is the UCSD 

men 's vo lleyball team that is being di s-
cussed . The co ld first got into the Triton 's 
hlood with a win over then-No. 10 USC and 
progressed into a fu ll -blown dead-of-win -
ter infection after an upset of No. 9 Long 
Beach State. 

for the Tritons, this is where the fever began 
to wear off as UCSD experienced the No. 1-
ranking first hand following five unan -
swered point by the Cougars. The Tritons 
co uld get no closer as BYU s lammed the 

door 10 the first game, 15- 11 . 

Coming out of the break in action, UCSD 
saw the wind leave its sai ls and the Cougars 
fired off two quick points to take the game, 
15-8. 

On Friday night , with all of the 
symptoms showing, UCSD ran head 
fir st into a cure more powerful than 
Sudafed. Nyqui I and mom 's home-

One of the major sy mptoms of a 
cold is inc reased drowsiness. UCSD 
was hit with thi s in the second game 
as th e usually reliable Triton defense 
hegan to falter. 

Down two games, it appea red as if the 
upset fe ver had left the Tritons for good. 
That was not the case, however, as the 
Tritonsj umped out to a lead to start the third 
game . A so lo block by junior Jon Yarri s, a 
ki II on an overpass by se nior middle blocker 
Mall Minehan and an error by B YU put 
UCS D up by a point. Another solo block hy 

Yarri ~ and a kill hy junior Guy Mount kept 
the Triton, even with the Cougars but thai

record to 1-3 In the young 1997 ,cason. 

The Sagehens grahhed two of the three

Broncos Hurdle Past 
Road-Weary Tritons 
ALMOST: Coach Brian Turner's squad traveled to Cal Poly 
Pomona in search of a win, but came up one point short 
By NIcole Vargas 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

With their 1997 campaign already a 
month old , one might think the pres,ure on 
the UCSD men' s tennis team i ~ heginning to 
fade. Afterall , they already have taken 
on some or the toughest opponents 

Divi~ion III has 10 offer, including the 
top smgles player in the nation and hi s 
teammates from Cal Lutheran. 

However, the Tritons arc still in 
for a battlc, looking ahead to their 
two-week, eight -game home stand he-
gi nning today, which includes matches 
agai nst Di vision 111 opponents Claremont 
and Redlands. They also must recuperate 
rrom a dose loss last Saturday on the road to 
Cal Poly Pomona, 5-4. 

For the first time this season, UCSD won 
two out of three douhles matches. In regular 
Division III scoring, thi s wou ld have sca led 
Ihe doubles point for the UCSD squad . 
However. because the Broncos arc DiVision 
II competitors, the scoring was dirrerent on 
this occasion, wilh each victory counting as 
a ~ingle point. 

The Triton~ cartured the top two s pot ~ in 
douhles, giv ing them the early 2- 1 lead he-
rore ~i ng l e~ play comlllenced. The top-
seeded ta ndc:m of Steve Shabel and An-
thony Melicharek defeated thei r Broncos' 
CO 111 pelll ion, H-4. The ~econd-~eeded pal r of 
Emil Mlhet and Mike Rmetl dropped thei r 
opponent. H-5, for thcir .,econd win togethel 
after a Win over Cal I.utheran earlier tim

Shahel ea~i1y won his lirM set, 6-3, but 

began hi ~ ~econd ~et with a 5-2 slumJl. 
However, Shahel was down, hut he 

wasn ' t ou t. He wen t on to win the next Ii ve 
game" downing the Bronco player, 7-5 . 

"Steve had the fi ght game to beat ICa l 
Pol y Pomona ' ~ I lOp player," Triton 
Head Coach Brian Turner said . "He 
gOI down a ncr h I ~ Ii rst set, but he 
came hack." 

Fourth-seated Ping Yeh also took 
home a singles win , defeating Chris 
Seid in two quick sets, 6-3 and 6-3. 
Thi s win was the Tritons' last of the 
day,though, lea ving UCSDone point 

shy of al Poly Pomona . 
"I made some adjustments to my game," 

Yeh said. "ISeidl was more of a volleyin); 
player, compared to my Cal Lutheran oppo-
nent, who was a baseline hitter." 

The Tritons lost not one, hut two grucl -
