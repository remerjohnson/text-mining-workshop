“Fiercely independent” student 
radio station KSDT has given up on 
plans to obtain an FM frequency. 
Station managers are now looking to 
build a radio tower to pursue an AM 
frequency instead.

KSDT station co-manager 
Meredith Wong said that the AM 
tower would cost approximately 
$100,000 and that she hoped it could 
be located in a central area of campus 
— although she was unsure where 
that would be. 

“We’re really serious about it, 
but we haven’t started much of the 
research,” Wong said.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
presented his revised 2010-11 
state budget last week, a plan that 
includes a new round of fund-
ing increases for public colleges, 
but that suggests cutting $3.7 bil-

lion from health-care services that 
impact low-income families who 
depend on state welfare programs. 

The suggested allocations to 
the University of California are 
nearly identical to the ones from 
Schwarzenegger’s January propos-
al, including the restoration of the 
$305 million cut last year and an 
additional $51.3 million in finan-
cial aid toward the 5,121 eligible 
students in the system who are not 
currently being funded. However, 
the governor’s newest budget 
would negate his January proposal 
to cut $111.8 million set aside to 

accommodate growing enrollment  
in the UC and CSU systems. 

In order to absorb California’s 
$19.1 billion budget deficit, other 
services would suffer major cuts — 
including a proposed $3.7 billion 
from in health care, that would 
cut the Medi-Cal program for the 
poor, along with state in-home 
support for the disabled. In addi-
tion, the budget takes into account 
Proposition 98 — which passed in 
1988 and guarantees a minimum 
pool of money for schools. Under

MONDAY, MAY 17, 2010 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

This year’s Sun God Festival — with acts like B.o.B, Relient K, Michelle Branch and headliner Drake — attracted a packed house on May 14. For the second 
time in Sun God history, all 16,500 student 
wristbands and 3,500 guest tickets sold out. 
     In 2008, the first time this happened, tickets 
didn’t sell out until the day before. This year, 
all tickets sold out by 2:30 p.m. on Friday, at 
which time students were turned away.

According to Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell — who 
organized this year’s Sun God Festival — the 
sell-out was due to the popularity of the event’s 
leading acts.

“We get complaints and yelled at when stu-
dents can’t bring their guests, but at the same 
time, we get yelled at and complaints when the 

students can’t bring themselves — so finding 
a good balance between those two is tough,” 
Bramwell said. “We had the same numbers as 
last year. It just turned out this year to be more 
popular of an event; more students wanted to 
come.”

At the 2008 Sun God Festival — when 
students wristbands were distributed for the 
entire week leading up to the event — tickets 
ran out on Thursday, leading students to pur-
chase all the leftover guest tickets for them-
selves that Friday. 

In 2009, students waited in line for up to 
four hours on the morning of the festival to 
receive their wristbands. Despite the crowds, 
however, over 1,000 of last year’s wristbands 
went unclaimed.

After nearly a year in the lab, 
UCSD researchers have scientifically 
proven the obvious: People eat more 
chocolate when they’re depressed. 

In 1999, Natalie Rose — a UCSD 
undergraduate at the time — worked 
with researchers on a study that con-
cluded that there is no correlation 
between certain foods and depression 
— with the exception of chocolate.

Nearly a decade later, Rose, now 
a gynecology resident at UC Davis, 
decided to head a joint UCSD-UC 
Davis study to pinpoint how many 
serving of chocolate correlated to 
varying levels of depression. 

“We were motivated by the fact 

that there is huge amount of lore link-
ing chocolate to mood, with virtually 
no scientific evidence backing that 
up,” UCSD associate professor of 
medicine and co-director of the study 
Beatrice Golomb said. 

Just over 1,000 people over the 
age of 20 living in the San Diego 
area participated in the new study, 
which took place over eight months 
in 2009. They completed surveys on 
their chocolate intake — with no dis-
tinction between types of chocolate 
— and a questionnaire that included 
more general questions about food 
habits and moods. 

Participants were also screened to 
ensure they were free of such afflic-
tions as diabetes and heart disease to 
ensure that they could remain in the 
study for the full eight months.

 Researchers compared the serv-
ings of chocolate consumed per 
month by those with and without 
signs of depression. 

The experiment showed that 
people with high occurrences of 

depression — as determined by 
their answers to the questionnaire 
— consumed about 12 servings of 
chocolate per month, while those 
who were generally less depressed 
ate about eight servings of chocolate 
per month. Those with no signs of 
depression ate only five servings of 
chocolate per month. (One serving of 
chocolate is approximately 1.3 oz, or  
the size of a regular Hershey’s bar.)

Results also showed that partici-
pants who tended toward depression 
did not demonstrate a higher intake 
of other traditional comfort foods 
— those high in fat, carbohydrates, 
protein or caffeine. 

In conclusion, Golomb said, the 
most recent study showed that only 
chocolate consumption — not that of 
any other food — is increased when 
depression levels are higher. The 
results did not show whether choco-
late actually makes people happier, 
more depressed or has no effect at all. 
However, Golomb said that research-
ers may soon launch a new study to 

determine these specifics.
“We have become sufficiently 

interested,” Golomb said. “We are 
considering doing a randomized trial 
that would elucidate the relationship 
between chocolate and mood, to see 
if it is a causal relationship.”

NEWS� MONDAY, MAY 17, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

This year, wristbands were distributed beginning the Thursday before the con-
cert, allowing students to pick up their wristbands with little wait.

“The wristband distribution went really well,” Bramwell said. “[Students] were 
shocked at the whole system and how smoothly it was going — at the fact that 
they had to wait, at most, 15 minutes. That alone was a huge morale booster for 
everyone.”

Sixth College senior Willie Liang said he tried to get a wristband at around 4:00 
p.m. on Friday, and did not try earlier because he was under the impression that 
there were enough for all students.

“I was kind of mad, actually,” Liang said. “It was kind of my last year, and I 
wasn’t able to get in but my friends were. I didn’t think it was going to — I had the 
perception that it was student fees, so we were guaranteed [a wristband]. I guess 
that was not the case.”

Though many students complained about not receiving wristbands, Bramwell 
said he was happy with the event’s organization and turnout.

“We completely solved a lot of the larger issues that happened last year,” 
Bramwell said. “Overall, I was really happy about it, and we had one of the largest 
daytime crowds in Sun God history, without a doubt.” 

With the 2010 festivities came some new logistical problems, however. At 
around 9:30 p.m., according to festival co-organizer Cindy Huang, crowding in 
the Dance Tent became such a security risk that it needed to be shut down for 
almost an hour. Huang said that the tent reached its 3,000-person capacity during 
tent headliner DJ Z-Trip’s set. Bramwell estimated that another 1,000 students were 
outside trying to force their way in.

Berzerk; The Sun God spirit showed itself in T-shirts, pins and — 
for the most enthusiastic — elaborate costumes; The Dance Tent 
was shut down for 45 minutes due to security-guard and student 
injuries; Rapper B.o.B. hopped into the division between two 
crowds during his 3 p.m. performance.

HOST, “THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART”

21�&$0386�³�Scantron grading machines — 
printer-like robots that cost upward of $3,500 — 
have recently become increasingly hard for profes-
sors to come by, especially in departments such as 
political and cognitive science. 

Besides being an inconvenience for all of 
UCSD’s underpaid and overworked professors, the 
cutback is especially troubling because students 
often don’t receive the results to  multiple-choice 
exams until after the Week Four drop deadline. So 
if we bomb a midterm but don’t know it before the 
drop deadline, we’ll be trapped in a class knowing 
our GPA will take a turn for the worse.

Until recently, the math and literature depart-
ments were willing to share their machines with 
other departments, but due to overcrowding shar-
ing is no longer an option. 

 In the absence of access to Scantron machines, 
political science and cognitive science departments 
should investigate alternative methods of grad-
ing Scantrons, such as hitting up A.S. Council for 
some spare student fees. 

Scantron scanners are costly, and pose an even 
larger financial burden in repair when broken. 
When the Social Science Computing Facility’s 

machine broke down, the most basic repair costs 
were listed at $1,100. As a result, according to asso-
ciate professor of Associate Dean of Social Sciences 
David Lake, the department was forced to fend 
without a grading machine, making it necessary 
to rely on other departments’ generosity in some 
cases. In others, TAs have been forced to grade 
tests by hand, backlogging scores by two weeks. 

In an e-mail to fellow A.S. councilmembers 
last week, A.S. Enterprises Advisory Intern Tobias 
Haglund suggested a project for one of the eight 
new campuswide senators: develop a rental system 
for the Scantron grading machines and lease them 
out to individual departments for a nominal fee. 

While there are indeed potential foils to 
Haglund’s proposal — including the fact that 
A.S. Council has no idea how much it’ll cost to 
implement the system — it’s at least a step toward 
addressing the issue at hand. Over the past several 
years, A.S. Council has been spending more and 
more on student events, while our quality of edu-
cation has declined. If students want the luxury 
of knowing whether to drop a class before the 
fourth-week deadline, it’s not out of the question 
for them to foot this bill — even if it means pay-

ing for something the academic departments have 
traditionally taken care of. 

Though the council has indeed been wary of 
helping out independent departments — such as 
Parking and Transportation Services — in the past, 
in a case where the student is the clear benefactor, 
there’s little danger of setting a precedent in which 
student fees fund a needed academic service.

Cognitive-science professor Gedeon Deák, 
however, is in favor of a universitywide centralized 
grading service for Scantrons, which would likely 
be provided through the department of Academic 
Affairs. But while Deák’s vision may be ideal, with 
so many other budgetary shortfalls at the universi-
ty, it’s also unlikely to be realized in the near future. 
Though it would certainly be a small accomplish-
ment, if the council were to sponsor a service such 
as Scantron grading, it would be a strong step in 
the right direction of using student fees to fund 
desperately needed academic accessories that have 
begun to disappear with budget cuts.

REBEKAH HWANG/GUARDIAN

Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my disap-

pointment in the university’s leader-
ship for its failure to respond to a 
recent act of hatred on this campus. 

Last Monday night, a UCSD 
student who identified herself as 
a member of the Muslim Student 
Association stood up in a public 
forum and announced her support 
for Hamas and Hezbollah, two ter-
rorist organizations whose genocidal 
charters state their goals to destroy 
the State of Israel and the Jewish 
people as a whole. 

Indeed, it was brought to this 
student’s attention at the time that 
the head of Hezbollah has repeatedly 
said he hopes the Jews will gather in 
Israel so that he doesn’t have to hunt 
them down globally. Still, she didn’t 
hesitate to show her support. 

To put this in perspective in light 

of recent campus events, it would be 
the equivalent of a student stand-
ing up in support of the KKK and 
hoping that all blacks would gather 
in Alabama so they could all be 
lynched at once. 

I am not asking that the uni-
versity limit her First Amendment 
rights; I am only asking that it be 
recognized that actions promoting 
hate have no place in our campus 
environment. 

La Jolla has a history of anti-
Semitism, where — prior to the 
establishment of this university — 
Jews were not allowed to buy homes 
or establish businesses here. It was 
upon the insistence of Roger Revelle 
— who said that a leading university 
had to include Jews — that Jews 
were finally allowed into La Jolla. 

As a Jewish student, I am deeply 
hurt and saddened by recent cam-
pus events, and I am questioning 
whether or not I belong to this com-
munity anymore. I am calling upon 
the university to recall the legacy of 

Revelle, and to recognize that a seri-
ous academic institution can neither 
be a platform for anti-Semitism nor 
for racism to flow freely. In the past 
few months, this university has expe-
rienced multiple instances of hatred 
and racism, yet it seems that we have 
learned nothing. 

When the Black Student Union 
cried out in pain, our campus com-
munity came together — not to dis-
cuss the legitimacy of their feelings, 
but to ask what we could do to help. 
Why are my cries and the cries of my 
community going unanswered? Why 
are we suffering in this pain alone? 
And, more importantly, why is the 
rest of this campus standing idly by?

—Myra Meskin
Member, Tritons for Israel

 

Dear Editor,
It seems horrifically wrong that 

we are not guaranteed tickets to 
something our student fees paid for. 
We demand the people in charge of 
the festival be relieved from their 
positions. 

It also is just that one-third of 
students who were denied tickets be 
reimbursed for the amount of their 
student fees used to finance the Sun 
God Festival.

Senior, Revelle College

I see them coming before they see me. They wander aimlessly through my dining hall, unaccus-
tomed to its layout, clueless as to the 
whereabouts of the deli, noodle, pizza 
and grill stations. They shuffle slowly 
until they reach my post, then stop 
in front of my station. I busy myself 
with some cheese in hopes that one 
of my coworkers will confront them. 
I am too cowardly for the task.

The old folks have arrived.
Don’t get me wrong: It’s not that I 

hate old people. They have far more 
life experience and knowledge of the 
past than I do. Plus, they are usually 
paternal and nurturing. I just don’t 
know how to relate to them. 

It’s probably because of Southern 
California’s obsession with youth. We 
host the airbrushed entertainment 
industry, throw Botox birthday par-
ties and send our grandparents to rot 
away in sterile facilities without the 
least bit of guilt.

My relationship with elderly cus-
tomers may also be because I only 
have one living grandparent — and 
she lives almost 3,000 miles away. My 
fading memories of her visits consist 
of endless cribbage games, gelatinous 
meat loaf and frightening age spots. 
The elderly have played almost no 
part in my life, so when I interact 
with them, I have no idea what to do.

The difference between my old 
and young customers is of speed 
and orientation. It’s not Gram and 
Gramps’ fault: Within a week of 
moving on campus, all our regular 
customers have memorized the din-
ing hall’s format. They know which 
station serves which foods; they 
know the prices and how to pay and 
how to find the utensils and napkins. 
So, when dealing with a nonstudent, 
my job suddenly requires a lot more 
effort.

Old folks often ask me to recite 
the nine kinds of cheese they can 
put on their sandwich. They inquire 
about the extra 50 cents it costs to 
add cheese in the first place. And 
they try to use American Express. We 
don’t take American Express.

The truth is, I’m so used to think-
ing of my place of employment as a 
surreal institution where everyone 
knows what a bobcat is, along with 
the fact that we only carry Pepsi 
products. It’s easy to forget there’s 
a whole world of people out there 
who don’t pay for all their meals with 
dining dollars, or order hamburgers 
from bleary-eyed students working to 
make a buck or two.

However, every Saturday when 
the weekly bridge game rolls into the 
dining hall, I am reminded that this 
is not the case.

They are early birds to the core. 
We open at 10 a.m. on the weekends. 
They know we open at 10 a.m. Yet 
every Saturday, there they are at 9:45 
behind the glass doors, staring me 
down like I am personally respon-
sible for their lack of caffeine. 

As far as I know, this group of 
professional card players has no 
affiliation whatsoever with UCSD, 
but my manager still reserves a por-
tion of the dining-hall seating for 
them, where we then have to turn off

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

the music that apparently distracts 
them from their games. And what 
do we — employees of a measly col-
lege trough — get in return for such 
overwhelming hospitality? 

Out of all of them, two cups of 
coffee. Small ones (on a good day).

You would think they’d be happy 
— what with us clearing out an 
entire slice of our dining space from 
of the kindness of our own hearts. 
But they still have plenty to com-
plain about.

They order their small coffees 
and I say: “That’ll be $1.40.” The 
reply — whether it’s from a little old 
woman in a delicate falsetto or the 
only World War I witness left on 

Earth — is always: “Oh my, prices 
are going up. That much?” 

When I can’t avoid being the 
messenger of the modern world, I 
switch to intense customer-service 
mode. For some reason, I believe 
that if I assemble all the ingredients 
of Gramps’ quesadilla in perfect 
order, he will adopt me as a surro-
gate grandchild. If this turns out to 
be the best meal of his life, we can 
travel back in time and he’ll be at all 
my tee ball games. He’ll take me to 
get a Slurpee when I make the honor 
roll. All my unrealized fantasies of 
having a grandfather will suddenly 
come true. 

So I smile as I sprinkle the 
cheese. I carefully spread the sour 

cream so there’s an even amount of 
dairy goodness in each bite. Even as 
I move on to younger customers, my 
mind will remain on his slow-cook-
ing quesadilla, knowing that I cannot 
let it burn — lest my one chance at 
our beautiful relationship go up in 
smoke with it.

Finally, when the cheese has 
melted and the tortilla is a golden- 
brown, I will serve up my beauti-
ful creation to the hunched older 
man, and he’ll walk out of my life. 
Without a backward glance of his 
balding head, he’ll pay for his food 
(but only after five more minutes of 
haggling with whoever was unlucky 
enough to get cashier duty) and 
leave me feeling used and alone.

On May 9, President Obama nominated Solicitor General 
Elena Kagan to be the 112th U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice. If the Senate 
votes Kagan in, she’ll be the youngest 
justice — at 50 years old — and the 
third woman to serve on the bench.

As the youngest-ever nominee, 
it’s not surprising that Kagan’s expe-
rience has been questioned. Though 
her time as the Dean of Harvard Law 
has given her some legal experience, 
Kagan has zero experience as a final 
decision-maker of difficult human 
issues. 

In the past 40 years, no nominee 
without experience as a judge made it 
to the Supreme Court. The last attempt 
was in 2005, when President George 
W. Bush nominated former White 
House counsel Harriet Miers — and 
that nomination was withdrawn 24 
days later. Before her nomination, 
Miers’ career had only peaked when 
she was hired as the personal attorney 
to the president’s campaign. Because 
Miers never served as a judge, she 
quickly drew criticism for her lack of 
experience. Similarly, Kagan’s academic 
— rather than judicial — background 
may well not translate to much of a 
service on the court.

Of course, Kagan wasn’t nomi-
nated for nothing. President Obama 
cites her “rich understanding for con-
stitutional law” and her ability to be a 
“trail-blazing leader” as qualifications 
for his nomination. However, until 
more concrete evidence of her judicial 
expertise comes to light, it would 
be wise for the Senate to hold off on 
sending Kagan to the court, rather 
than send a wild card to America’s 
highest court.

While there’s been a good deal of public apprehension over 
Solicitor General Elena Kagan’s 
lack of experience as a judge, it’s far 
from the most concerning of her 
shortcomings as a Supreme Court 
nominee. 

If approved by the majority of 
the Senate, Kagan will serve the 
country for life. That’s why it’s so 
frightening that she has barely 
shared her personal opinions with 
the public: She’s straddled the fence 
on important issues like gay rights 
and abortion, making it nearly 
impossible for Senators to deter-
mine which way she will rule in the 
future. 

Kagan has authored precious 
few law review articles, mostly pub-
licizing vaguely socialist ideologies. 
In addition, transcripts of Kagan’s 
speeches have practically no traces 
of opinion.

 Even friends of hers, such as 
CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, 
have said they’ve got no clue what 
to expect from her on the Supreme 
Court. 

Maybe Obama’s got more inside 
information than the rest of us, but 
if the rest of the country doesn’t 
know where Kagan falls on the 
political spectrum, that’s due reason 
for alarm.

the proposition, the 40 percent, or 
$1.4 billion, of the general fund 
that must be given to schools will 
be taken from subsidized child-
care services for 142,000 children. 
Federal money would still be avail-
able for about 78,000 children 
whose families fall within the low-
est income bracket. 

Under Schwarzenegger’s pro-
posed budget, state employees 
would also take a hit: Instead of 
three furloughs a month, they 
would receive one unpaid “person-
al” day per month, and their salaries 
would be cut by 5 percent across the 
board. However, the state contribu-
tion to employee pensions would be 
raised by 5 percent. 

An additional $1.2 billion would 
be cut from prisons, where inmate 
health-care services would be 
reduced and nonviolent offenders 
in state prisons would be moved to 
less expensive county jails.  

UC spokesperson Lynn Tierney 
said the university hopes the state 
Legislature — which is currently 
negotiating the final budget — will 
follow the governor’s funding pro-
posal, despite the effect it would 
have on low-income families and 
state employees.  

“This is a very tough budget 
year,” Tierney said. “The legislature 
has almost impossible decisions to 
make. We’re hoping that the legis-
lature will stick with the governor’s 
recommendation.” 

In another win for financial 
aid, Schwarzenegger’s plan would 
restore $45.5 million to the Cal 
Grant program, which provides an 
estimated 46,000 low- to middle-
income UC students with neces-
sary financial aid. The governor 
originally proposed reducing the 
program by $79 million by not 
considering income eligibility and 
award levels. 

“[The restoration of the Cal 
Grant program is] going to help out 
in the short term, and I think that 
was the main argument: a short-
term solution for low- to middle-
income students who receive Cal 
Grants,” Sanchez said. “We needed 
that program stabilized. I know stu-
dents are going to benefit from 
it, because a lot of those students 
receive those grants. A lot of those 
students need those grants.” 

Former A.S. Vice President of 
External Affairs Gracelynne West 
lobbied to restore the Cal Grant pro-
gram alongside students UC Irvine, 
UCLA and UC Santa Barbara at 
the governor’s office in downtown 
Los Angeles last Wednesday. She 
applauded the preservation of Cal 
Grants, but said that the money 
should not come at the expense of 
health care low-income families.  

“It’s commendable that they’re 
really starting [to] prioritize higher 
education, but we need to prioritize 
the underserved communities as a 
whole, because they’re being cut out 
[to support] higher education,” West 
said. “That’s not the way I want to 
see UC, CSU or community colleges 
funded.”  

Tierney said that, though 
Schwarzenegger’s budget would not 
provide the $931 million original-
ly requested by the UC system, the 
$305 million would be a steps toward 
retaining faculty and offering more 
courses.  

“It signals a re-prioritization of 
education [and] the realization that 
we cannot move forward without 
funding what is to be our future,” 
UC Student Association President 
Victor Sanchez said. “We’re hopeful 
this is a first step.” 

However, to counter 
the increased UC funding, 
Schwarzenegger proposed to elimi-
nate campus outreach — specifi-
cally, the $31.3 million used for 

academic preparation programs 
such as includes Early Academic 
Outreach Programs. EAOP aims to 
prepare middle- and high-school 
students for college. Similarly, the 
budget would limit academic prepa-
ration in the CSU system to $18.6 
million.

The governor also suggested 
funding an additional $355 million 
toward construction projects on UC 
campuses that have already been 
planned — such as classroom build-
ings, dormitories and lab facilities. 
According to Schwarzenegger, this 
would create roughly 3,300 private-
sector jobs for those working in the 
construction industry. 

The UC Committee on Finance  
will hold a budget update presenta-
tion at the UC Board of Regents 
meeting on May 19 to discuss the 
governor’s latest proposal.  

“It’s really, really much more 
important than before that students 
look at the budget and realize what 
that means, and get involved in 
advocacy, because these legislators 
are being asked to choose between 
health-care programs for homeless 
people and funding UC,” Tierney 
said. “These are really tough decisions 
that people have to make. Students 
have an opportunity to make their 
voices heard, now.” 

Committee members also plan on 
approving the official 2010-11 budget 
for the Office of the President. 

State legislators are currently 
negotiating a final interpretation of 
Schwarzenegger’s proposal, which 
will require the governor’s signa-
ture for approval. The amount of 
time it will take to pass the budget 
is uncertain still, as a two-thirds 
majority is needed to pass any bud-
get-related matter through the state 
Legislature.

By Connie Qian
Senior Staff Writer

In the past, professors and teach-
ing assistants in the cognitive sci-
ence-department used other depart-
ments’ Scantron machines to grade 
their exams. This quarter, however, 
they were unable to find a depart-
ment willing to loan them a machine.

“Because cogni-
tive science does not 
have its own machine, 
historically, we have 
begged access from 
other departments 
that do have machines 
and were willing to let 

us share,” cognitive-science professor 
Gedeon Deák said.

In response, former A.S. 
Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund 
— a student in the cognitive-science 
department — called attention to the 
issue on May 12 when he noticed 
that his midterms were not being 
graded and returned as quickly as 
before. Because many students rely 
on their first midterm grades to 
determine whether or not to drop a 
class, Haglund said this delay now 
endangers their ability to do so before 
the Week Four deadline.

“The TA ended up having to do 
it all by hand,” Haglund said. “It took 
him two or two-and-a-half weeks. 
People were frustrated about drop 
deadlines. The professor sent out 
an e-mail saying, ‘Sorry — wish we 
could do something about it.’”

Other departments, such as politi-
cal science, have had similar problems. 
Associate Dean of Social Sciences 
David Lake said that since the social 
science Scantron machine has not 
been replaced from when it broke 
a year ago, he had to borrow the 
machine belonging to the mathemat-

ics department, which allowed him 
one-time access as a favor. 

Deák attributed the cognitive-sci-
ence department’s grading troubles 
to UCSD’s across-the-board funding 
cuts.

“As all departments have their 
budgets cut, we will probably see 
a trend toward shutting down or 
limiting services like Scantron scor-
ing,” Deák said. “This is a concern, 
because budget cuts are projected to 
continue or even get worse over the 
next few years.”

In an e-mail to the all A.S. coun-
cilmembers last week, Haglund pro-
posed that the A.S. Council put some 
student fees toward a new system in 
which academic departments — and 
potentially students — could rent 
out Scantron machines. Haglund 
said a Scantron-lending service could 
take the responsibility of paying for 
machine repairs off the shoulders of 
hurting departments. 

Though Haglund said he was 
unsure where the money for the project 
would come from, the A.S. Enterprise 
Operations account might be a pos-
sible source. He also suggested that a 
2010-11 campuswide senator chose the 
endeavor as one of his or her long-term 
projects for the year. 

Although Deák said that a cen-
tralized Scantron system is necessary 
at UCSD, he argued that the respon-
sibility of funding the machines 
belongs not to the students, but to the 
office of Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake.

“I would argue that it is the uni-
versity’s responsibility — through the 
VCAA’s office — to provide the main

“It was more of a security issue 
because people were pushing, and there 
was too much pressure going on, and 
there was security getting hurt — so we 
shut it down for a bit so we could let the 
pressure die down,” Huang said. 

Bramwell collaborated with the 
head of Staff Pro, the production man-
ager, the captain of the UCPD, the facil-
ity manager for RIMAC and the head 
of University Events Office on the deci-
sion to close the dance tent. Though 
they were reluctant to cut Z-Trip’s set, 
several passed-out concertgoers and 
injuries to security guards made the 
shutdown necessary. 

“People can’t wait outside of a 
tent when they can still see and hear 
everything going on inside of the tent, 
because they want to get in, and they’re 
causing bodily harm to other people,” 
Bramwell said. “We didn’t want to just 
cut off the music and have an angry 
mob on our hands, but at the same 
time, we needed to slow it down — 
needed to stop it.”

Marshall College senior Loryn 
Kanemaru said she was inside the 

dance tent when it closed.
“I think they pushed down the 

fences — it just happened so fast, I 
wasn’t really sure what was going on,” 
Kanemaru said. “I didn’t think it was 
super crowded [inside]. It wasn’t like 
at the concert, where people were 
smushed together.”

In order to encourage dancers to 
vacate the tent, Kanemaru said orga-
nizers shut off the projector after DJ 
Z-Trip’s last song and turned off the 
music. The Dance Tent remained shut 
down for approximately 45 minutes, 
then reopened with a set from DJ 
JSharp. It stayed open until the end of 
Drake’s performance at midnight with 
no additional problems.

Bramwell said that, though he will 
not be organizing the event next year 
and thus cannot speak for whoever 
takes over his duties, he anticipates the 
possible elimination of the Dance Tent.

“There’s obviously going to have 
to be some changes as to how the tent 
itself is controlled, and I’m sure it will 
be pushed back in some shape — either 
removed entirely, or kept the same type 
of environment without the physical 

tent itself,” Bramwell said. “At the end 
of the day, the tent itself has a capacity, 
and the popularity of that kind of music 
and scene on the campus is greater than 
any tent. I mean, you can’t make a tent 
larger than that.”

The only main changes to last year’s 
setup on RIMAC Field was the replace-
ment an inflatable jousting course 
with human foosball and the installa-
tion of a giant inflatable A.S. Sun God 
logo, which Bramwell said cost around 
$5,000-6,000.

“The idea is that it’s a lot of fun to 
have a photo-op space at the festival, 
especially in recent years, with people 
complaining, ‘Oh, they’ve taken away 
the heart of Sun God — it’s not on the 
actual lawn anymore,’” Bramwell said. 
“The combination of those two things 
made it obvious that we should, in 
some way, shape, or form, try to bring 
the Sun God back, in some way, to the 
actual festival on the field. And the 
benefit of this is that it can be used for 
years to come.”

According to KSDT executive-
at-large Marcus Rosario, the station 
met with Communications General 
Corporation consultant Robert 
Gonsett on April 7. Gonsett has also 
advised campus media outlets such 
as Triton Television and UCSD-TV, 
the administration’s official TV sta-
tion. 

Gonsett said it is highly unlikely 
KSDT will be able to acquire an FM 
frequency, due to a high concentra-
tion of frequencies in the city of San 
Diego and across the U.S.-Mexico 
border. Rosario called UCSD a “black 
zone,” meaning there are already too 
many radio stations with high-power 
FM transmitters in the area for a new 
station to compete. 

Gonsett said the last possibility 
for KSDT to obtain an FM frequency 
would be if the UC Board of Regents 
were to purchase a failing local sta-
tion, 107.5, but that the likelihood of 
that is very low. 

“FM is still a really big longshot,” 
Rosario said. 

Alternatively, Rosario is look-
ing into possibilities suggested by 
Gonsett such as HD radio — like 
Sirius and XM —, AM radio or 
broadcasting the station’s program-
ming over UCSD-TV.

Of these options, Rosario said he 
believes KSDT’s best bet is to go after 
an AM frequency. 

Wong said that because AM sta-
tions broadcast music at a lower fre-
quency, and thus lower quality, they 
are not as commercially profitable as 
FM stations and are therefore easier 
to obtain. 

In addition, she said that apply-
ing for an AM station would be a 
lot simpler. On FM, KSDT would 
need to have both a tower and base 
station approved by the Federal 
Communications Committee, while 
an AM frequency would require a 
license for the tower only. 

Wong added that Gonsett told 

KSDT managers about a loophole 
that would allow them to broadcast 
their material without censorship.

“The tower would have to be 
licensed, but if we only broadcast 
within the circumference of the 
campus, there’s a loophole for col-
lege campuses, and we wouldn’t 
have to get a license,” she said.

Rosario agreed that an AM sta-
tion is the most feasible option for 
KSDT.

“At this point, we are going to 
pursue AM radio,” he said. 

However, Wong said that —  as 
there are only four weeks left in the 
2009-10 academic year — it is unlike-
ly KSDT will acquire an AM frequen-
cy before next fall. She said the sta-
tion will prepare the necessary paper-
work over the summer, including fil-
ing an application with the Federal 
Communications Commission.

“We do have to apply with the 
FCC, but it’s not as heavy as an FM 
application,” Wong said. “There are a 
lot of people who are involved, but it’s 
starting the process of [talking] to the 
right people.”

Rosario said the project will be 
expedited by the fact that both he and 
Wong will be returning to UCSD next 
year. He said they hope to make their 
AM debut early next year.

“We want to get the project roll-
ing in the beginning of Fall Quarter, 
so we’ll have more momentum 
from hype and incoming members,” 
Rosario said. 

Rosario said the station will rely 
on student fees —  allotted by A.S. 
Council — to fund the project, 
which includes hiring more consul-
tants to advise AM station manag-
ers through the process, a legal rep-
resentative to provide details about 
broadcasting on campus and updat-
ing KSDT’s equipment to work with 
the tower. 

A.S. Associate Vice President 
of Student Services Meredith 
Madnick,  who works with organiza-

tions such as KSDT and TTV, said 
she supports KSDT’s endeavors.

“With a bigger amount of 
money, it would definitely have to 
be something that we would have to 
present to council, and see if that’s 
something that they want to fund 
for when the time comes,” Madnick 
said.

KSDT is unsure of how much 
the process will cost and will make 
a proposal to the A.S. Council Fall 
Quarter of next year.

“[The cost] needs to be evaluated , 
like how much that will be,” Madnick 
said. “And it will be a huge chunk of 
money out of our mandate reserves. 
So, with this new council, I don’t 
know how they see it in terms of a 
funding priority.” 

Wong said she has plans to talk to 
councilmembers, UCSD administra-
tors and the regents about the tower. 

“Land is really hard to obtain 
on campus, because a lot of people 
want land, and there are different 
guidelines for construction,” she said. 
“We’d have to meet with people to 
figure that out.”

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang said he will 
need to see a concrete budget propos-
al before deciding how much money 
the A.S. Council is willing to give 
KSDT for the tower. However, he 
said the student radio station will be 
a “top priority” next year. 

“When the budget is presented 
Week Nine, we’ll be able to look at 
it more,” he said. “The budget for 
the next fiscal year hasn’t been put 
out yet [by A.S. President Wafa Ben 
Hassine], but I understand this has 
been a priority for the past year. I 
really want to look at how feasible it 
is, and how the turnout would be for 
students.”

BORDER
BUSINESS

Just like the epic campuswide Sun God Festival of yesteryear, the 
weekend exodus of UCSD students over the U.S.-Mexico border is stuff 
of the past. Party busses crammed with scantily clad underagers — leav-
ing all academic anxieties, inhibitions and dignity behind — would 
shuttle them 30 minutes south of campus every Friday and Saturday 
night. 

Before the U.S. began requiring passports to come back over the 
border in 2008, and drug-war deaths started to rise around the same 
time, undergraduate students and members of the U.S. Navy were lured 
south by the musky myth of Tijuana: dance floors sardined with sweaty, 
bare-bodied coeds; an endless flow of cheap liquor and greasy street 
food; illicit substances and wet T-shirt contests; smoke machines, sticky 
bar counters, tequila shots, stripper poles, tequila shots, foam parties, 
tequila shots and the rare foray away from Avenida Revolucion to Zona 
Norte — TJ’s red-light district.

Shuttling students to and fro was infamous club promoter Ray 
Ramirez — better known as “Hollywood Ray.”  His fleet of limobuses 
departed almost every weekend from college campuses in the San Diego 
area, delivering busloads of under-21ers to TJ’s main strip of clubs and 
Rosarito — a popular spring-break destination one half-hour below the 
border. According to Ramirez, his busses would shuttle upward of 3,000 
students to Mexico on any given weekend.

“In Mexico, you can almost do whatever you want, and you’re safe,” 
Ramirez said. “You can black out, you can dance up on the table, you 
can do body shots, you can make mistakes — so that by the time you 
turn 21 and you’re going to bars in America, you already have all this 
experience, and you’re street-smart. You’re good to go. You’re not 
throwing up and passing out — you should’ve already done that shit in 
Mexico.”

Until recently, Ramirez’ limobus business was able to trumpet con-
venience and safety as a selling point. His busses went straight to Safari 
Nightclub (which Ramirez partially owns) in Tijuana or Papas and Beer 
in Rosarito, where his customers were granted free entry and unlimited

INFOCUS JUSTICE IN PALESTINE WEEK

A t the beginning of last week, the Muslim Student Association erected a wall along Library Walk to mimic the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The staging of the wall coincided with the A.S. Council’s debate over a pro-
posed resolution calling for the University of California to divest from companies 
that lend military aid to Israel.

The MSA also brought a number of speakers to campus — including author 
Norman Finkelstein, UC Berkeley lecturer Hatem Bazian and UCSD alumna and 
former Black Panther Angela Davis. The tension between pro-Israel students 
and Palestine sympathizers peaked during a Young Americans for Freedom-
commissioned speech on May 10 by pro-Israel commentator David Horowitz. 

Scrawled on the wall were depictions of the hostile environment in the Gaza 
Strip, including a dialogue on unsanitary water conditions and a painting of a 
woman who had been shot. A “Run for Palestine” treadmill was set up beside the 
wall — just behind a faux Israeli checkpoint — in hopes of raising money for 
Palestinian refugees. Of the 400-mile barrier, 250 miles were run by participants, 
generating $250 to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund.

CLUBHOPPING

L ast week, Dancesport — UCSD’s competitive club dance team — made its national television debut, performing alongside Niecy Nash and Chad Ochocinco on ABC’s 
“Dancing with the Stars.” As one of four collegiate teams 
from across the nation chosen to appear this season, five 
UCSD couples performed a samba during the College Dance 
Championship portion of last Tuesday’s show. They were up 
against Purdue University. 

Prior to the show, Revelle College junior and Dancesport 
co-captain Karen Li said she was excited to represent UCSD.

“I personally embrace our identity as nerds, but we’re about 
to show America that even nerds can really shake it,” Li said.

After submitting a tryout video to “Dancing with the Stars” 
earlier this year, the UCSD dancers were informed they had 
landed a spot on the show. They immediately scrambled to put 
together a brand-new routine that followed the championship 
guidelines. The team usually performs medleys — combin-
ing Latin dances like the cha-cha, rumba and jive — but ABC 
producers asked competitors to stick to one style for their two-
minute performances.

The day of the competition, the UCSD team flashed wide, 
100-watt smiles while whipping their red sequined skirts 
through the air. Complete with intricate formation changes, 
the team performed an ambitious dance routine that wowed 
judges — despite minor critiques.

“As a nationally ranked team, we just want to show people 
that we are upholding our reputation and are the best,” said var-
sity team member and Muir College sophomore Antwon Trinh.

Dancesport were showered in accolades like “Great job,” 
and “Well done,” from the judges, and earned a score of 24 out 
of 30 for their samba — two points above Purdue’s mamba. 
The official winner will be announced on today’s episode, after 
audience votes are tallied. From there, the favorite will advance 
to the final College Dance Championship that will take place 
on the night of the season finale. 

According to Dancesport coach Peter Edwards, the team 
treated the performance like it would any other show.

“We always do it the same kind of way: bringing the same 
kind of spirit, the same kind of energy,” Edwards said. “It 
doesn’t matter who you are — we want to give you our best 
every time,” said Edwards.

Dancesport has been enrolled in the club-sport program 
on campus for almost 20 years, and is currently ranked third in 
the nation for collegiate formation teams. At the recent national 
championships — the Stanford Cardinal Classic — the UCSD 
varsity team placed first, while junior varsity took second. 

Forming the largest club team on campus, the 150 mem-
bers of Dancesport are separated into four different skill

alcohol. To maintain a reliable repu-
tation, he said he personally made 
sure that each student who left San 
Diego on one of his busses returned 
safe and sound.

However, according to Ramirez, 
the new passport law — passed 
in January 2008, and requiring all 
those entering the U.S. to show 
their passports at the border — 
along with a spike in drug-related 
violence forced him to halt his 
weekly trips to Mexico after 2008’s 
spring-break season. 

Since Mexican President Felipe 
Calderon declared war on the coun-
try’s drug cartels in December 2006 
and deployed about 50,000 troops, 
violence in the country has risen 
dramatically. The University of 
San Diego’s Trans-Border Institute 
estimated that about 22,700 deaths 
have occurred in Mexico since 
January 2007.

The U.S. Department of State’s 
most recent travel warning for 
Mexico — issued May 6, 2010 — 
declared that “the security situation 
poses serious risks for U.S. citizens.” 
In addition, a January 14, 2010 
Warden Message issued by the U.S. 
Consulate General in Tijuana rec-
ommended a list of “actions to take 
if caught in the middle of a gunfight/
gunfire,” implying that travelers 
might run into one such situation.

However, according to Ramirez’, 
reports of gruesome drug-related 
border crimes have been exaggerat-
ed by the media, scaring American 
tourists away for no good reason.

“It’s not a war,” Ramirez said. 
“There’s no shooting or bombs. It’s 
all bullshit. I go to Mexico all the 
time and it’s safe. It’s no more dan-
gerous than other major cities in 
America.”

Joseph Sabet, a graduate student 
in electrical engineering, said that 
Mexico’s recent swell of violence — 
along with the passing of his own 

21st birthday — discouraged him 
from partying south of the border, 
like he did when he was an under-
graduate.

“It’s dirty and sketch, but perfect 
if you’re under 21,” Sabet said. “I 
wouldn’t go now, though — it’s too 
dangerous. My sister’s roommate’s 
ex-boyfriend went with a group, 
and one of them got mugged by 
some gang and beat up by the cops 
within an hour.”

Revelle College senior 
David Lee, on the other 
hand, doesn’t buy the 
friend-of-a-friend horror 
stories. He said he still 
visits Tijuana or Rosarito 
at least once a quarter.

“You just have to be 
smart about it,” Lee said. 
“Go with a group and 
stay in the well-known 
tourist areas. Don’t bring 
any valuables and don’t 
do anything stupid. It’s 
just common sense.”

All hearsay aside, 
Public Affairs Officer 
for the U.S. Consulate 
General in Tijuana 
Joseph Crook said in an 
e-mail that the consolate 
advises travelers to be 
educated when crossing 
the border. According to Crook, 
students should phone friends back 
home regularly, avoid unruly behav-
ior and only use official “sitio” taxis.

The U.S. State Department’s 
website states that U.S. citizens 
aren’t usually targeted in Mexico’s 
drug-related crimes, and that a vast 
majority of the 100,000-odd U.S. 
students who head south every year 
for spring break return home safely.

According to a May 7, 2010 
article in the Los Angeles Times, ever 
since the January arrest of Teodoro 
Garcia Simental — a major drug 
trafficker and crime boss — the 
violence tainting Tijuana has waned 

significantly.
However, an official travel warn-

ing is still in place — especially 
along the U.S.-Mexico border, home 
to key drug-trafficking sites like 
the notorious Cuidad Juarez, where 
three times as many people have 
been killed than anywhere else in 
the country.

Juarez, located across the Rio 
Grande river from El Paso, Texas, 

made national head-
lines two months 
ago when three indi-
viduals linked to the 
U.S. Consulate were 
gunned down by mem-
bers of a drug gang. 
Incidents like these, 
coupled with last year’s 
H1N1 flu outbreak, 
have weakened many 
students’ will to party 
below the border. The 
sparse dance floors 
and empty seats of 
the once-boisterous 
Avenida Revolucion is 
a testament to the col-
lege population’s new 
hesitation.

“I have bartenders 
and waiters who can 
hardly feed their fami-
lies,” Ramirez said. “It 

keeps me up at night.”
Ramirez said he is one among 

many hoping to revive Tijuana’s 
tourism industry, which has suf-
fered in all areas — from his own 
busses and nightclub to the roving 
tequila men with damp towels, 
whistles and bottles of room-
temperature Jose Cuervo, poised 
and eager to force a shot down your 
throat for a buck or two. Even the 
street vendors working the border 
traffic have taken a hit.

Since he halted his weekly TJ 
party-bus business, Ramirez has 
started a similar party-bus opera-
tion in Hawaii, and continues to 

promote clubs and events through-
out San Diego. He even provided 
the limobuses for Phi Gamma 
Delta’s FIJI Islander event on 
April 1, 2010 and Mission Beach’s 
Floatopia on May 8, 2010.

And Ramirez hasn’t put a com-
plete hold on his SD-TJ shuttle 
service. The operation has merely 
become seasonal, now starting 
around spring break and even 
beginning to boom through the 
summer months. However, instead 
of American college students — 
who are largely wary of travel to 
Mexico — Ramirez said the major-
ity of his clients are Irish college 
students visiting San Diego for the 
summer.

“I love them and they love me,” 
Ramirez said. “These guys are just 
down to do whatever. They’re just 
so fun and worry-free, and all about 
having a good time. And damn — if 
I drank as much as them, I would 
die. We have to get extra alcohol if 
we have open bar, because they just 
want to keep going. They will go 
until like 10 a.m. They will go to the 
next day — it’s out of control.”

As summer approaches, Ramirez 
is gearing up for the arrival of the 
Irish. He’s planning weekly limobus 
trips to Tijuana on Wednesdays, 
and Rosarito on Sundays. He has 
a team of college reps in Ireland 
promoting his events, and said he 
expects this year’s batch of students 
to top that of the last few years. 

In the end, though, Ramirez said 
his biggest priority is motivating 
San Diego college students to start 
visiting Mexico again.

“I’m gonna straighten this whole 
mess out, and don’t be surprised if 
I do,” he said. “I’m going to make 
it easier for everyone to go back to 
Mexico soon — people are going to 
get sick of all this shit.”

brackets. Participants learn all styles 
of dance — from swing to nightclub 
— and spend between five to 10 hours 
per week at practice. The five couples 
who appeared on “Dancing with the 
Stars” held rehearsal in Edwards’ pri-
vate studio from midnight to 3 a.m. 
four days a week for the two weeks 
leading up to the show, so as not to 
interrupt regular Dancesport prac-
tices.

“I would describe the UC San 
Diego Dancesport team as a bunch 
of very diverse individuals — there’s 
bioengineers, neuroscience majors 
— who all come together because 
we love to dance,” said Varsity team 
member and Warren college student

emerge victorious from eight of nine 
competitions this year. 

“The kids were competing all year 
long: every single competition, they 
stayed, engaged and worked as hard as 
they possibly could, [leaving] it all on 
the dance floor,” Edwards said.

The Tritons will perform a grand 
finale on Saturday, May 30 in Price 
Center Ballroom West, showcasing 
all the routines with which they have 
competed this year, including a few 
hip-hop and tap numbers. Tickets 
are on sale at the UCSD Box Office. 
And if all goes according to their team 
motto — “kick butt, take names and 
send them home crying, with dignity 
and respect” — it should be worth the 
ticket.

in conference versus postseason play — a dis-
parity she attributes to the difference in recruit-
ment standards. 

“In our conference, the competition gets high 
between two teams: Cal State Stanislaus and Cal 
Poly Pomona,” Davis said. “We really don’t have 
enough competition against teams like [Brigham 
Young University]-Hawaii and HPU. Those are 
the teams that we have to beat in playoffs, and 
unfortunately, we just fall short against teams 
like them. In our conference, most of the play-
ers are American. Outside of the conference, we 
face girls from Ukraine and China. It’s a different 
story outside of conference.”

Despite the early postseason exit, the 
Tritons’ season was by no means disappoint-
ing: This marks their 30th straight trip to the 
NCAA postseason (though they used to fall in 
Division-III), and their seventh straight confer-
ence title with a dramatic victory over Stanislaus 

on April 17.
As her 31st season as head coach of the 

women’s tennis team draws to a close, LaPlante 
said she is already looking forward to her 32nd.

“It is always sad to see the season end,” 
LaPlante said. “We have a few end-of-the-year 
activities, but now it is time to look toward next 
year. A lot of our girls are returning, and it is 
time to look to get things going again next fall.”

The Tritons will graduate only two of their 
players. Davis said she is optimistic about the 
more prominent role UCSD’s younger players 
will be able to fill next season.

“Even though were losing three players, I’m 
really excited for next year,” Davis said. “We 
have four freshman in the team this year, and 
they all improved a bunch over the season. I’m 
excited to see in them in the lineup next year.”

Guardian strategy.
The Guardian sideline — led by 

associate photo editor John Hanacek, 
managing editor Alyssa Bereznak 
and associate opinion editor Cheryl 
Hori — revised their shit-talking tac-
tics by aiming verbal assaults toward 
the scantily clad, STD-infested Koala 
harem. Simultaneously, on offense, 
Blanc shuffled the batting order to 
minimize the number of Guardian 
runners stranded in scoring position. 

The lineup responded by knock-
ing in five runs in the top half of the 
seventh inning to grab a momentum-
shifting 6-4 lead. 

With their backs against the wall, 
the Koala staffers answered with a 
rally of their own that culminated in 
the game’s defining moment: a three-
man boat-race drink-off, sparked by 
a dispute over the number of Koala 
runs scored in the inning — and 
whether one particular gray-bearded 
marsupial had actually worked for the 
Koala at one time. 

Amid intense negotiations over 
the terms of the drink-off, Gregorian 
admitted he had never seen the old 
man before, conceding that he prob-
ably graduated sometime during the 
Great Depression.

The jobless 46-year-old was 
immediately expelled from the game, 
and the final terms were settled: a 
Guardian boat-race victory meant 
a 7-6 Koala lead, while a Koala win 
would raise it to an 8-6 advantage.

Edwin “Killer” Gonzalez — who 
had already won two drink-offs — 
partnered with senior staff writer and 
team captain Jake Blanc and associate 
sports editor Matt Croskey. Together, 
they demolished the Koala team of 
Gregorian, black-eyed terrorist Lo 
and associate editor Wes Field — the 
latter of whom proceeded to cry like a 
bitch. The Koala loss left its members 
in a drunken stupor, realizing their 
self-proclaimed “superior drinking 
skills” wouldn’t be enough to sleaze 

out a win.
Clinging to a narrow 7-6 lead, 

the Koala rebounded with a score to 
regain a two-run advantage. As the 
keg began to stream thinner — signal-
ing the game’s final stages — a Koala 
victory seemed imminent. However, 
due to Blanc’s dashing good looks and 
negotiating skills — capable of resolv-
ing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — 
Gregorian’s heterosexuality wavered, 
and he was wooed into extending the 
game by another fifteen cans of beer.

Benefiting from a series of Koala 
fielding errors in the top of the 
eighth, the Guardian managed to load 
the bases with two outs — bring-
ing severely inebriated sports editor 
Vishal Natarajan to the plate. After 
fouling off two pitches, Natarajan sent 
a line drive into left field — which 
bounced off an unsuspecting Koala 
slut and plated two runs for a 10-8 
Guardian lead. 

As daylight faded, along with the 
sobriety of all, the Koala stepped to 
the plate for the game’s final at-bat, 
and quickly cut the G lead to 10-9.

With runners on first and second 
and only one out, a player who Fields 
believes to be named John, grounded 
into what appeared to be the game-
ending double play.

G third baseman Croskey swiftly 
fielded the ball to first baseman 
Jesse Alm for the out. However, in 
a bitch-ass attempt to advance to 
third on Croskey’s throw, the Koala’s 
Dave the Carpenter — also known 
as Hammer Pants, or the dude who 
wrote “Compton Lynching” on a 
piece of cardboard in the Student-Run 
Television studio — bolted from sec-
ond to third, sloppily sliding past the 
base by five feet. Alm then instinctive-
ly fired the ball back to Croskey, who 
tagged Pants out. Chaos ensued.

In sad desperation, the entire 
Koala bench charged the field to argue 
that both “John” and Pants were safe. 
Guardian players coerced the whiney 
Koala bitches into accepting the out at 

third base, but conceded to a drink-
off.

If the Koala won, they would keep 
“John” at first; if the Guardian won, 
they would take home the victory and 
a year’s worth of bragging rights. 

Gregorian, accustomed to taking 
giant loads of foam down his throat 
on a daily basis, won the challenge, 
and the game continued with a run-
ner at first. Down to their final out, 
the Koala singled to left field to put 
the tying run in scoring position. 
However, the next Koala hitter lined 
a grounder to shortstop Blanc, who 
fielded the ball cleanly with a Koala 
runner bearing down on him.

The entire game had been build-
ing up to this one final clash: Both 
Blanc and the Koala runner braced 
themselves for a collision that would 
decide the win. Gripping the ball in 
his glove for the tag, Blanc lowered his 
shoulder and absorbed the blow from 
the charging runner — demonstrating 
the same strength and resilience the 
entire Guardian team had exhibited 
throughout the afternoon — and held 
the ball firmly for the win.

An all-out, slightly bromantic 
celebration between Guardian players 
errupted. They swarmed the third-
base line to scream their lungs out in 
pure, orgasmic jubilation while the 
Koala losers (literally) picked their 
asses and licked their fingers on the 
sideline. Better luck next year, fuckers.

where who don’t realize there are 
teams in the league other than the 
Boston Red Sox and the New York 
Yankees: Show some respect for the 
other teams out there, or you will be 
brutally embarrassed after getting 
your ass called out.

The Yankees scoffed at Braden’s 
reaction to A-Rod because he was 
a no-name pitcher who plays for 
a small-market team on the West 
Coast — an asshole reaction that 
epitomizes the reason why all those 
outside the Red Sox-Yankees bubble 
hate those teams.

The fact that they have the 
resources to buy themselves cham-
pionships isn’t nearly as irritating as 
the fact that their players and fans 
think that no one else in baseball is 
worthy of their respect.

So, when Braden continued 
feeding the press opinions about 

the shit-talking incident — damn 
straight he was trying to get some 
attention. Is that really so wrong? 
As a young pitcher with a troubled 
past who’s had a pretty good year, 
what’s wrong is that he had to cuss 
out A-Rod to get noticed in the first 
place.

In the end, actions speak louder 
than words: Twenty-seven straight 
outs fight harder than backhand-
ed insults from a guy who makes 
over $33 million more than you. 
With A-Rod’s career soiled by per-
formance-enhancing substances, it’s 
not clear whether he’ll ever make it 
into the Hall of Fame. If he decides 
to visit, though, he can check out the 
section where Braden’s perfect game 
will forever be celebrated. 

This year, a game in May meant 
almost as much as one in October 
for unheralded fans of America’s 
favorite pastime.

The Tritons sent 10 hitters to the 
plate in the fifth inning, capped by a 
two-run homer from junior catcher 
Lee that brought the score to 7–1.  

The right-handed Knudson 
allowed only four runs in all nine 
innings, walking two and strik-
ing out five. After striking out the 
final two Hawaii Pacific hitters, the 
Tritons mobbed Knudson on the 
mound to celebrate their return to 
the College World Series.

“The feeling of being on the 
mound [at the end] was phenom-
enal,” Knudson said. “It was like 
things happened in slow motion. 
Just that first-person view of Kellen 
[Lee], who is a brother to me, run-
ning full speed at me with his arms 
out was something I will never for-
get.”

The Tritons also saw five players 

make the 2010 NCAA West Regional 
All-Tournament Team, including 
Most Valuable Player in the tourna-
ment Kyle Saul. Gregorich, Albitz, 
Shibuya and redshirt freshman des-
ignated hitter Danny Susdorf also 
earned a spot on the honorary team. 

The eight-team NCAA National 
Championship will begin May 22 
in Cary, N.C. The NCAA Selection 
Committee will determine the 
schedule on May 17, but the Tritons 
are already gearing up to make the 
trip. 

“We are preparing by having 
solid and quality practices with a 
great focus and intensity,” Knudson 
said. “We are going to keep working 
hard in being fully prepared for that 
first pitch in Cary.”

Coming from a gray slab of rotting cement as a home and fulfilling the role of the 
redheaded stepchild before an entire 
nation can be a beautiful thing — 
especially when you rub your eventual 
glory in the face of your richer, more 
popular and significantly douchier 
older brother.

That’s exactly what happened on 
Mother’s Day at the McAfee Coliseum 

in Oakland, when Dallas Braden, 
playing for the perpetually poor and 
overlooked Oakland A’s, pitched the 
19th perfect game in Major League 
Baseball history against the Devil 
Rays.

Two hours and seven minutes 
after the first pitch, Braden had not 
only cemented himself a spot in 
Cooperstown, but also come out on 
top of a month-long feud with Alex 
Rodriguez and the ultra-pretentious 
New York Yankees.

Prior to this feat, Braden had two 
distinct reputations. To those on the 
West Coast, Braden was best known 
as the bad-ass from area code 209 
(Stockton, Calif.) who put Rodriguez 
in his place during an A’s-Yankees 
game last month. For those on the 
East Coast, Braden was the attention 
whore who tried to extend his “15 
minutes of fame” (in Rodriguez’s own 
words) by feuding with the New York 
superstar. 

In case you missed it, Braden 
bitched out A-Rod at the end of the 
sixth inning, yelling at him to stay 
off the pitcher’s mound. Rodriguez 
later laughed off the incident, saying 
that he’d never had anyone tell him 
that before —”especially from a guy 
that only has a handful of wins in 
his career.” (Damn A-Rod, you really 
gotta bring that up? Braden should 
have mentioned the third baseman’s 
glove-slapping abilities to the press.) 

But the main reason Braden’s per-
fect Sunday elicited an enormous 
smile — with just a hint of smug 
smirk — for the sea of A’s faithfuls 
(and small-market fans on the west 
side of the country) is much deep-
er than the satisfaction of putting a 
selfish, roiding slugger in his place. 
OK, maybe the smirk was because of 
that, but Braden’s perfect game sent 
a message to the MLB, along with 
sports media and baseball fans every-

As per annual post-Sun God tradition, still-thirsty Guardian staffers clashed with rival “newspaper” the Koala last 
Saturday at a local park in a high-stakes slosh-
ball game.

Though the Koala was hoping to repeat last 
year’s 29-4 shellacking of the Guardian, what 
editor in chief Kris Gregorian and his band 
of diseased losers did not expect was that the 
Guardian would unleash the most spectacular 
team performance in UCSD sloshball history — 
a 10-9 comeback victory for the ages.

In contrast to previous Guardian-Koala 
matchups — typically characterized by shame-
less Koala cheating — the G unit triumphed 
due to solid defense, timely hitting, subversive 
smack-talking and unstoppable chugging skills.

The game opened with what would be one 

of the Koala’s few victories: Gregorian won 
the initial drink-off against otherwise bomb-
ass Guardian Editor in Chief Simone Electra 
Wilson, claiming home-field advantage and 
making his liver cirrhosis proud. The game 
started eerily similar to last year’s game, as the 
Koala took an early 2-0 lead.

However, intent on avenging the Koala’s 
drunken destruction of the Guardian’s distribu-

the deficit: After Nelson hit a double, social 
chair Shida Haghighat brought him home on an 
infield single. 

The Koala regained the lead with a string 
of base hits in the fifth inning, building their 
advantage to 4-1 and necessitating a shift in

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The Tritons 
played their final match of the year 
on May 6, suffering a 5-1 loss to 
Hawaii Pacific University in the first 
round of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division-II West 
Regionals.

UCSD came into the matchup 
ranked No. 15 in the nation, while 
Hawaii Pacific came in ranked No. 11.

The Tritons captured the No. 3 
ranking in the region after taking 
their seventh consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Association title, 
but the Sea Warriors’ superior rank-
ing earned them the rights to host the 
first round.

“[Hawaii Pacific] played really 
well,” UCSD head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. “It was a windy day, and we got 
behind in doubles, [so] it was too late. 
Hawaii is very strong; they were able 
to go all the way to the final four and 
lost to the winners, so they have a 
very tough team.” 

The Hawaii Pacific squad made 
a respectable run all the way to the 
semifinals of the NCAA Division-
II national championships after 
beating the Tritons last Thursday. 
However, they soon fell to eventual 
third-time champion Armstrong 
Atlantic University, who ended its 
season ended the season undefeated 
at 33-0.

May 6 was a familiarly difficult 
day for the Triton women: Hawaii 
Pacific knocked UCSD out of the 
postseason last year as well. UCSD 
fell behind early when the doubles 
teams struggled against their opposi-
tion. The team of juniors Taskeen 
Bains and Natalie Varnay lost 8-5, 
the team of senior Anita Anthavale 
and freshman Jacquelyn Davis lost 
8-3 and the team of freshman Melissa 
Breisacher and sophomore Samantha 
Yeung lost 8-5 — putting the Tritons 
down 3-0 to begin the best-of-nine 
competition. 

The only Triton who ended up 
scoring points was Varnay, who 
won her singles match 6-2 and 6-1. 
Junior Taskeen Bains was defeated 
6-3, 6-2, while Davis lost 6-1, 6-2. 
With the victory over Davis, the 
Sea Warriors attained the fifth point 
necessary to snag the victory over 
UCSD with three singles matches 
left unfought.

Similar to previous seasons, the 
Tritons tasted success in conference 
play before struggling in the playoffs. 

“We would love to get to the next 
round one of these years,” LaPlante 
said. “But I had a great season with 
great girls, and we all had a really 
good season.” 

 The Tritons dropped a much 
closer 5-4 decision to Hawaii Pacific 
on March 25. However, the Sea 
Warriors’ sweep of the doubles por-
tion proved too much for the Tritons 
to overcome this time around. 

Hawaii Pacific fielded a com-
pletely Eastern-European lineup — 
including two players from Bulgaria, 
two from Sweden, one from Romania 
and one from the Czech Republic.

After her first season as a Triton, 
Davis said she has noticed is a dis-
tinct contrast in the quality of teams

REPEAT CHAMPS

UCSD steamrolled through the NCAA West Region this weekend, earning three wins in three days to 
take the regional title and secure a trip to 
the College World Series for the second year 
in a row.

The top-ranked Tritons crushed Hawaii 
Pacific University 12–0 on May 13, then 
fought for a narrow 4–3 victory over confer-
ence rival No. 24 Cal State Dominguez Hills 
on May 14. After Hawaii Pacific defeated 
Cal State Dominguez Hills in an elimination 
game to merit a spot in the final, the Tritons 
beat the Sea Warriors for the second time in 
three days to clinch their second consecutive 
NCAA West Regional title.

“We had great energy all tournament and 
were just having fun being ourselves as a 
team,” junior pitcher Guido Knudson said. 
“It was one of the best weekends of baseball I 
have experienced. You can’t describe playoff 
baseball and the chemistry we had in the 
dugout and on the field all weekend.”

Held at the MLB Urban Youth Academy 
in Compton, Calif., the tournament opened 
with a resounding win for the Tritons. 
Junior pitcher Tim Shibuya recorded his 
school-record 12th win of the year, while 
junior catcher Kellen Lee had four runs 
batted in and the Tritons cruised to an easy 
12–0 win. 

The team’s next game against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills was a significantly tighter 
affair. Holding onto a slim 3–2 advan-

tage in the top of the ninth inning, the 
Tritons looked on as senior starting pitcher 
Matt Rossman allowed two base runners. 
Junior pitcher Daniel Simmons came on 
to try to convert the save opportunity, but 
gave up a double to center to the Toros’ 
Derrick Duarte — allowing one run to 
score. Fortunately for the Tritons, though, 
the potential winning run was thrown out at 
the plate, thanks to an excellent relay from 
senior outfielder Robert Sedin and senior 
shortstop Vance Albitz. 

With the score tied 3–3 in the bottom of 
the ninth, Sedin drew a walk and advanced 
to second on a balk by the Toros’ pitcher. 
Albitz was intentionally walked to set up 
a potential double-play opportunity, but 
junior outfielder Kyle Saul laid down a per-
fect sacrifice bunt to advance the runners to 
second and third with just one out.

The Toros intentionally walked junior 
Aaron Bauman to allow a possible force-out 
at home plate, but the Tritons next hitter 
— senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich 
— was hit by a pitch, and the winning run 
came in to score.

In the title game on May 15, the Tritons 
rode a seven-run fifth inning and capital-
ized on a complete game performance from 
Knudson for a 9–4 victory. UCSD had eight 
extra base hits in the game and 12 in total, 
while five different players had RBIs.
