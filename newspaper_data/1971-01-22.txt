Regent's Meeting 

UCNewspaper Guidelines 
Approved With Provisions 

Carl Neiburger 
City Editor 

The Regents' Committee on Educational 
Policy approved guidelines for student 
newspapers yesterday. The approval, however, 
included the understanding that a 
representative delegated by the chancellor 
review each issue within 24 hours after 
publication for rule violations. The proposal 
will come before the full board today for final 
approval. 

UCSD Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
George Murphy agreed with Haskins in an 
interview with the TRITO TIMES. He said 
that before the amendement it was presumed 
that " the papers would be consistent with the 
guidelines" which, he observed, they had helped 
to write. He said that " the reversal (of this

FriJay, January 22, '''' 

Regent John Canaday, who first brought the 
matter of student papers before the board, 
introduced the 24 hour provision as one of four 
provisions he desired to be amended to the 
guidelines submitted to the Regents. The other 
three provisions stated that " responsibility for 
the conduct of student publications is vested in 
the chancellor, that apparent violations of the 
by-laws should be referred immediately to the 
proper body," (the Communications Board ), 
and that the chancellor may overrule the 
Communications Board or act if the board does 
not do so within three weeks of the date that any 
complaint is received, 

presumption ) is what I think is not really 
necessary." However, he foresaw no change in 
administrative policy at UCSD, other than that 
someone will be required to read the TRfTON 
TIMES every day. 

UCSD Scientists mesmerize media representatives at conference on Tuesday. (story on page 2) 

Los Angeles Chancellor Charles Young 
addressed the board, saying, "I don't think they 
(the provisions) establish any new policy, what 
they do is describe the way in which the process 
works." 

Committee Established to Evaluate 
Teachers and to Improve Methods 

Papers Placed "In Opposition" 
DAILY BRUIN editor Ann Haskins, however, 

told the Regents that the provisions "place the 
papers in direct opposition to the chancellor. " 
She explained that While the provisions merely 
express what has been implicit policy, they do 
so in such a way that presumes that the 
newspapers will violate rules. She compared the 
24 hour rule to administrative inspection of the 
Associated Students or the Academic Senate on 
a 24 hour basis. 

Student Activists 

Reworkings Draw Compliment 
Regent Canaday, who had previously been 

highly critical of a number of campus 
publications, complimented the administrators 
and students on their work on developing the 
and reworking the guidelines. He explained that 
the guidelines "serve a very useful purpose" as 
a tool for each chancellor to meet problems that 
may occur on his individual campus. 

Canaday emphasized that "I do not now and 
have not ever had in mind any intention to pre-
censor newspapers." He said that he was aware 
that pre-censorship is prohibited by law-"and in 
my mind rightfully so," he added. 

Regent DeWitt A. Higgs, who comes from San 
Diego, complimented the TRITON TIMES, 
saying " If it is an example of campus papers, I 
thoroughly approve of it. " He indicated that he 
had seen the last several issues of the TRITON 
TIMES and was having it sent to him regularly. 
" It is a very professional-like newspaper at this 
time," he said. 

Canaday had earlier complained of a 
photograph depicting four nudes posing on a 
water bed in the Dec. 1 issue of the TRITO 
TIMES. In a letter to Chancellor Herbert York, 
he sta.1ed that he had received a copy of the 
issue with a petition complaining about it signed 
by a mother of a student and 17 of her friends.

A committee dealing with 
teacher evaluation and 
improvement is presently in an 
embryoni c stage of 
development, according to 
Muir Provost John Stewart, 
chairman of that committee. 

Designed to enhance the 
relationship between faculty 
and students, the Committee on 
Teacher Evaluation and 
Improvement hopes to 
establish a process that will 
lead to better communication 
between the professors and 
their students. According to 
Stewart, this will facilitate the 
process of improving teaching 
methods and course selection, 
and it will provide both the 
professors and the students 
with an added dimension for 
their understanding each other. 

"Suth evaluations would 
generate meaningful and useful 
information that an individual 
could use to restructure his 
course. It would be a form of 
constructive criticism in a 

3 On Trial; 11 Get Continuances 
Frank Phillips 
Staff Writer 

On Tuesday morning nine present and former UCSD students 
charged with trespassing during last Spring's campus 
disturbances were given a 30 - day delay before the beginning 
of their trials in an Diego County Municipal Court. Two other 
tudents charged with related but more serious offenses were 

also given continuances. On Wednesday morning, however , 
three students charged with crimes relating to the sit-ins in 
Urey Hall and Building 2A-prime did go on trial. 

The joint trial of Jim Hirst, a City College student, and Bruce 
Coston has provided Â·the most interest in two days of legal 
maneuvering involving the 14 person charged with various 
crime re ulting from the prote ts of Defen e Department 
funding for campu research. At the outset of their trial the 
two defendants fired th ir attorney and requested a 
continuance 0 that th y could obtain new coun el.

Hirst told the court that he had poken with a Long Beach 

law er named John Atla and that Alia had agreed to tak

Alia and found that he wa not licen d to practic In

admonished the defendants to relate their question more to the 
charges before the Court. 

Hirst is charged with battery on campus police officer

But when a valid survey can 
be developed and implemented 
will depend on solving 
dilemmas concerning how the 
program is to be carried out. 

Hitch Request Plan 
This move towards 

instituting such a committee 
was stimulated by the request 
of UC President Charles Hitch 
as part of the direction the 
University is currently 
following in placing more 
emphasis on undergraduate 
education. 

" I am asking each 
Chancellor to develop a plan of 
action appropriate to his 
campus for strengthening or 
re-affirming the commitment 
to under graduate 
education,including the steps to 
be taken to carry out the plan. 
Each campus mu t act to 
ensure that undergraduate 
tudents receive educa tion of 

the highe t po sible level. The 
undergraduate program must 
significantly involve faculty of 
all ranks at all levels, including 
the lower division." said Hitch 
in a published talemenl. 

The first meeting of the 
Committee on Teacher 
Evaluation and Improvement, 
wa held la t week to 
d termin the nature and the 
future of uch a program.

departments or the indiVIdual 
profes ors use their own

some feedback on their 
execution. 

The merits and problems of 
uch a program were discussed 

at last week 's meeting of the 
committee . From the 
standpoint of the student, a 
program of teacher evaluation 
would ten'! to increase the 
quality of the undergraduate 
experience in the clas room by 
raising the effectivenes 01 the 
teachers, according to AS 
President Mike Palcic, who is 
on the committee. 

"Thi would provide the 
system of continuous feedback 
that would enhance tbe 
undergraduate 's ability to get a 
better education. As a re ult, 
the professor knows the student 
reaction and this will improve 
the over-all ability of the 
University to relate to the 
tudent . What we do with a 

teacher evaluation program is 
of maximum benefit to the 
tudent which will in turn lead 

to th betterment of the 
profe sors." said Palcic.

actually green cheese, that the 
cheese was left behind when 
the cow jumped over it and tha~ the jump took place in the

It may have been formed right

f~om 4.0 to 3.0 billion years in

that some rocks have been

New Regent Wilson Riles 
Seeks to Strengthen UC 

Teacher Evaluation .... 

Robert Miller 
Staff Writer 

" I am dedicated to strengthening the 
University of California. I see no reason why it 
can not be the best in the world with the talent 
and the resources we have in California." So 
said Dr. Wilson Riles , the new California 
superintendant of public instruction and ex-
officio member of the UC Regents in a 
telephone interview with the Triton Times. 

Riles, who will attend his first Regent 's 
meeting today, views the present relationship 
between the students, and the administration 
and Regents as being a vicious circle. 

"There have been problems that the students 
are unhappy about. Apparently they were not 
heard and their views did not fall on very 
receptive ears when they did get through," said 
Riles. 

RecreatloD Creates " MerrY'gG-Round" 
He feels the public reaction against student 

activities created an atmosphere that enabled 
the Governor 's office and the California 
legislature to bring in their policies. This, 
according to Riles, has created a merry-gG-
round syndrome with little rational assessment 
of the situation by both sides. 

"What I'd like to do is to get at the root causes 
and at whatever else is possible to get people 
involved in strengthening the University rathel' 
than the choosing up of sides within different 
philosophical camps. Everyone loses unless we 
can identify the problem and move forward 
together, " Riles said . 

Commenting on the recent budget freeze 
placed on University funds , Riles said that the 
monetary situation should be approached from 
a different perspective. He advocates 
establishing the goals and needs of the 
University first, and then proceeding with the 
finances from there. 

campus that nourishes amicable relationShips 
cond~cive to expression with dignity and truth , 
not VIOlence. 

A breakdown in communications, states 
Riles, is a major contributor to the crisis in the 
University. He noted that " if we can open up 
systematic discussion and debate together, then 
we can come to grips with the best possible 
direction to follow. " 

ActioDs , Not Tbougbts 
On campus politics, and in particular on cases 

like those of Angela Da vis and Herbert Marcuse 
which involve UC professors with a radical 
political stance, Riles feels that their position 
must be viewed in terms of their actions not 
their thoughts . ' 

Riles said he is not concerned with radical 
faculty members as long as the political view 
does not interfere with the individual'S job. 

"The criteria to be used to judge the professor 
is not his or her political views, but whether 
they use their position to propound their own 
political philosophy or if they try to disrupt the 
University to promote their own views rather 
than promoting free and honorable 
scholarship," said Riles. 

He said admission to the University of 
minority groups should be evaluated in terms of 
objectivity and fairness . Riles stated that if the 
present means of selecting incoming minority 
students is unfair and arbitrary because they 
come from culturally deprived backgrounds, 
than the criteria should be changed. 

But Riles also said that the graduating 
minority students should have acquired the 
same standard of achievement as any UC 
graduate. 

"Our basic concern i that we expect a 
student to perform well. Any student must come 
out of the University as a scholar. If we are not 
careful , we will set up a dual kind of student and 
end up with another type of second-class 
citizen," said Riles. 

(continued from page 1) 
teacher and making him a good 
one. " It is destructive cruelly 
to frighten and embarrass a 
professor when no offer of 
resources to remedy the 
situation are offered ," he said. 

Plans for an agency on 
campus to deal with teacher ' 
improvement once the 
evaluations can be diagnosed is 
also a future plan of this 
committee. 

Don Helinski. Revelle 
Biology Professor and a 
committee member, feel s that 
UCSD is in a good position to 
take some steps to improve 
teacher performances. "We 
are still sma II enough to 
achieve proper student-faculty 
relations which would enable 
us to work up to a beneficial 
association. We must put some 
teeth into procedures or 
programs that would make the 
guy do the job in the 
classroom," he said . 

Other areas discussed at the 
meeting, besides the search for 
what constitutes an accurate 
evaluation were : 

-Ho w is accurate 
information provided to a 
student who has an option in 
selecting his courses? 

- How does one approach 
those with the power, such as 
Dept. Chairmen, in order to 
help improve the individual 
professor's performance? 

- How is proper information 
conveyed to the Provost (who 
is responsible for final faculty 
hiring and firing decisions ) or 
the Budget Committee (which 
is responsible for allocation of 
funds for professorial 

appointments and promotions) 
in terms of the teacher's 
ability? 

- How are the survey results 
made known to the faculty and 
the students? 

Residual Benefits Expected 
Dr. Stewart hopes that such 

an evaluation and 
improvement program would 
have several residual benefits. 
He expressed hope that means 
for evaluating and aiding 
Teaching Assistants ' 
performance and for helping to 
train prospective professors 
would be established. He also 
said that a possible result would 
be more sophisticated teaching 
techniques. 

Help for Minority Students 
Dr. Russell . who is in charge 

of the minority admissions 
committee at the Med School , 
said ,. I am primaril y 
interested in teacher 
evaluation so far as minority 
students' special problems are 
concerned. We should devote a 
large segment of our training,

minority students who are not 
prepared to compete with other 
students, and to enable them to

classroom situa tion ." 

Remarked Dr. Shaevitz, 
" This issue cuts across the 
whole function of the 
University - the matter of the 
excellence of teaching." 

"We ~ust get out of the bag of simply making 
cuts WIthout any concepts of what they will 
mean. Instead , the funding of the University 
should be done with the role of the student's 
education in mind . A consensus on priorities 
must be obtained once the goals are agreed 
upon , and then we can talk in terms of 
resources," said Riles . 

He remarked that he plans to visit all the UC 
campuses in the future as an observer. 

" I want to spend some time getting to know 
the situation. I plan to visit the campuses and 
talk and listen to the students at the grassroots 
level. I hope to get all the ava ilable information 
before taking any action as a member of the 
Regents. I want to be in a position of having the 
information from the best possible sources," 
said Riles.

SteWardesses Violent Protest "Counter-Productive" 

Riles emphatically stated that he could not 
condone violent protest. He said it was counterÂ· 
productive. He cited his plans for the prevention 
of campus violence by saying, " if I can play any 
role at all on the Regents, it will be one of 
findi ng ways and means by which inputs by the 
students can be gathered in a fair and objective 
way. If ideas are to clash in a free atmosphere 
without violence, I don't know where else in our 
society that it can take place at but the 
University.' .

Can you address yourself to the growing belief 
that Vitamin C is effective in preventing colds, 
and also valuable in curing colds?

Dear Terry : 

Third College GadJlies People believe what they want to believe, as is their right. I wouldn' t attempt to interfere unless their belief constitutes a clear danger to their well-being. Fortunately, Vitamin C, or 
ascorbic acid , does not appear to be a very toxic 

If there's one thing that's becoming 
increasingly clear to us, it's that the 
campus conservatives, who have been 
most vocal in the condemnation of 
"radicals," are prepared to use the 
very tactics they criticize-:' While 
talking in terms of ethics and morality, 
they've learned by ' example all too 
well, and now actively employ the age-
old "ends justify the means " 
ph iI osoph Y . 

So it is that Prof. Jack Doug las 
decided to take the law into his own 
hands last November . Douglas, self-
appointed vigilante and prosecutor of 
Third College , decided that in-
formation thought to be contained in 
certain files was more important than 
Academic Senate protocol.

volunteers were told before their colds were 
finished whether or not they had been getting 
the real Vitamin C, the duration of colds in the 
ones who knew they were getting the real thing 
became shorter than in the control subjects who 
discovered they weren't. 

In another experiment with two groups in 
which the subjects weren't told who was really 
getting the vitamin, the colds lasted the same 
length of time in both groups. 

To see if ascorbic acid could .prevent colds, 
another group of volunteers received 3,000 mg 
of Vitamin C daily for three days prior to 
inoculation with cold virus and for six days 
after. Absorption of the vitamin was confirmed 
by urinary excretion studies. Another group 
received dummy tablets before and after 
inoculation with cold virus. No difference was 
found in the number or severity of colds in these 
two groups. If you 're interested, most of the 
stUdies for and against the effectiveness of 
Vitamin C are carefully (and unemotionally ) 
reviewed in Nutrition Reviews, 25:288, 1967. 

Dr. Ancel Keys, a prominent nutritionist at 
the University of Minnesota School of Public 
Health , writes in the October"November 1970 
issue of Consultant : .... .in fact , no 
experimental , clinical, or epidemiologic bases 
exist for adviSing patients with colds to take 
large doses of ascorbic acid, either in citrus 
juices or synthetic vitamin preparations." Food 
and Drug Commissioner Charles C. Edwards, 
M.D., puts it a little more strongly. He says the 
public is wasting its money in the stampede to 
buy Vitamin C, and he describes the usage of 
Vitamin C for preventing or curing colds as 
" ridiculous. " 

Probably all of this interest in Vitamin C 
these days is a response to our unconscious 
awareness that, in spite of everything, the 
common cold remains most uncommonly 
common. 

Not that we're always thrilled with 
Academic Senate protocol; the faculty 
is generally too shy of publicity. But 
there is a time for confidence . In every 
organization there must come a time 
for matters to be discussed openly and 
honestl y. Personnel matters are 
especially touchy . In the heat of 
discussion people say things , but later 
change their m inds. Such information 
misused and taken out of context can 
be damaging .

We do not know what lengths 

Douglas will go to to prove his political 
points. It is not at all inconceivable that 
he will prostrate himself before the 

Take Nothing On Faith 
Such is the informat ion contained in 

the "raw" files that Douglas made off 
with -INFORMATION, WE MIGHT 
ADD, THAT IS PROBABLY CON -
TAINED IN MOST FILES. As brought 
out by Provost Watson, it is not the 
contents of the raw files which were 
"l egally" inspected by Douglas, that is 
at issue. It is the highÂ·handed manner 
in which the files were "inspected" and 
the fact the files may have been passed 
around . 

More of the pol icy discussions of the 
Senate - and, for that matter, the ad-

media in the hopes of becoming a 
martyr-- a helpless vi ctim of the liberal 
faculty. 

We hope that Prof. Douglas still has 
enough respect for the University 
community he is a part of to d iscuss his 
disagreements internally, and to 
pursue his goals in a manner com -
mensurate with that of a University 
faculty member . But if he is not con -
tent to do so, we hope the rest of the 
community will realize" just who its 
friends are .

A November article by Beverly Beyette says 
the nation will spend $67 billion dollars on health 
care in 1970, and 39 percent of this will be spent 
on hospitals. More money will be spent for 
sickness than for education. Medical doctors 
will receive $13,400,000,000 (billion ), of which 
drugs will cost $7.37 billion. In spite of the 
billions spent for hospitals , there still isn't room 
for all patients. Average hospital costs are $78 a 
day; some cost $100 a day. not including 

century, these advocates of natural health have 
proven to themselves and could prove to others, 
that there is no need to be sick. Drugs are not 
only unnecessary but they are often harmful , 
while a proper natural diet, exercise, rest, 
sunshine and pure water, will maintain vigorous 
health . 

._------------------------------...,- doctor's bills <which sometimes bankrupt tlÂ·ll1e~ patients). Hospitals are increasing rates at 6 

The natural health advocates do not claim to 
be super smart, or to know mysterious formulas 
or drugs that keep people healthy. They say to 
listen to all methods, even though the medical 
and drug monopOlies seek to prevent other 
methods from being made public. Don 't take 
someone's word just becau e he claims to be an 
"authority." Take nothing on faith, but test for 
yourself the methods presented. If you give a 
fair test to the natural health methods you will 
probably become as enthusiastic as the other 
followers of the plan.

In spite of the enormous cost, the people of

terrible money cost of sickness, to say nothing 
of the suffering ; neither has it remedied lost 
time, nor lost revenue in income taxes to the

For the intelligent investigator, who looks 
with worry on the widespread sickness in 
America and its ruinous costs, and would like to 
hear the natural method, classes are conducted 
in the experimental college on Tuesday nights 
at 7 p.m. The next class will be in Room D. For 
other information about classes, inquiries 
should be made at Aztec information center. 
There is no charge. 

The natural health advocates have no fear of 
sickness nor the terrific co ts connected with it. 
There is a fr edom of mind which itself is well 
worth the time spent in making an investigation

Surrealism Lives-In La Jolla 
Carrie Rickey 
Arts Writer 

In your dreams have you ever visualized floating off .into the 
azure with Dylan in a balloon? Opened a Window to find that 
the window is sky and the sky is glass? Imagined yourself as a 
pre-packaged person jumping free out of a pa rcel-post package 
like a C.O.D. jack-in-the-box ? 

Dreams are a rather personal. near-sacred thing. However, 
a genre of art has been devoted to exploring the dream, 
portraying and interpreting the workings of the . mind as 
ma ni fested in dreams. This genre is known as Surrealism. 

Images as mentioned above may be found at the current 
exhibition at the La Jolla Museum of Art. The show is entitled 
"Continuing Surrealism ." The title arises fro m the will to 
prove that art histori ans could possibly be mistaken when 
classifying Surreali sm as existing from 1924 , when Andre 
Breton's Manifesto on Surrealism was published, to about 1949 , 
when Abstract Expressionism appeared on the art horizon. 

Paul Sal kisian's aerial fantasy "Untitled (Dylan)" currently 
on exhibit on at the La Jolla Museum of Art . 
Lawrence Urrutia , assistant director of the La Jolla Museum 
of Art di spels the theory that Surrealism has faded away by 
presenting recent Surrealist works in painting, SCUlpture, and 
a ssembla~ e .

San Diego Drama 

The Pussycat, '-'The New Black Crook," and George Szanto 
Jay Gillette 
Arts Writer 

"The Black Crook" by George SUltO. 
OpeDS Tuesday It Southwestern College, 
Tickets on sale at Urey Hall Box Office, $1.50, 

Downtown San Diego around Fourth and F Streets is ' a 
precinct of peep-shows, topless bars, pornographic bookshop~ , 
woebegone hotels, and girlie theaters. The brightly-lit 
Pussycat The&ter is here, between F Street and . The Bu~y 
Beaver Book Store. Directly across the street IS a plam 
building, an ex-fire extinguisher company, a weak. light shining 
through i:.s badly whitewashed windows. There IS a sheet of 
paper on the door that reads " ew Heritage Theater." A .pl~y 
written by UCSD literature professor George Szanto IS m 
rehearsal here. Together with director Welton Jones, an 
entertainment editor of the San Diego Union, Szanto is 
producing an entirely original drama called "The New Black 
Crook." 

Szanto: "The first thing we wanted to do," be explains'."was 
to create theater ' that is, we thought there was a place In San 
Diego for serious'theater. We'd seen sever~l kinds of theater in 
San Diego, first Theater 5 (an esoterICally experu~ental 
group ) and then the other extreme - the Globe, MISSIon 
Playhouse, and places like that. . They do reaso~ably good 
Shakespeare in the summer, but prlmanly do estabhshed plays 
that are either part of culture with a great big C, or are. recent 

ew York big hits or sometimes even less than big hits. We 
thought what we could do in San Diego was create a theater 
which could provide good entertainment and yet serve a 
serious social function ; a serious theater that was at the same 
time entertaining and pedagogic." . . 

Downtown the rehearsal hall is unheated, and inSide 
everyone is bundled up against the cold. The old buildin.g's 
fu ses cannot entirely support lights, tape recorders, heatmg 

appliances and the electric organ. Heat was deemed the most 
expendable commodity. The shivering actors and dancers are a 
broad mixture of San Diegans interested in what the New 
Heritage founders are trying to build. None of them are paid ; 
all volunteer the six nights a week they spend in rehearsal. 
Three of them are Uc'SD students : Robin Hunt, Cathy Dean, 
and Ted Stauch. 

The rest include people with various theater backgrounds- a 
dog groomer who once ran an Escondi~o theate~ ; a high school 
teacher who has directed plays both In the Umted States and 
Australia ; the Globe's Best Actress award winner of 1970; a 
member of an electrical firm 's management staff; a young 
lieutenant who recently won the All-Navy Talent Award ; and a 
librarian at the San Diego Union. The dancers range in age 
from 14 to 55 years, and include several of Sea World 's 
"aquamaidens." Despite the cold, despite the long drive; 
despite the lack of monetary compensation, these actor.s and 
dancers are spending almost every mght for weeks working to 
perfect "The New Black Crook." . .... 

Szanto: "Everyone enrolled in thiS production IS dOing It 
totally because he wants to do it. Nobody is paid. People are 
doing it because a ) they would like to see and set up a .new 
theater in San Diego ; bl 1 think for many, they've never 
worked in a play that's grown as they help evolve it. Th~t . is . 
they' re not writing it, in the sense that Theater 5 was writing 
its own play, but what they are doing is seeing it change 
according to the necessity of the play - we 're still changing it. 
Also, they enjoy acting , and they enjoy being with other people 
who enjoy acting." â¢ 

Judging from the efforts of the dedicated people in that cold 
downtown building. "The New Black Crook" is tremendously 
good, tremendously talented, "entertaining and pedagogic" 
dramatic work . It is both a serious social comment and an 
extremely funny.play , and promises that theater in San Diego 
has taken a new and refreshing turn for the better. 

Time Ticks Away at Playhouse 
Larry Johnson - Arts Writer 

Youth is the most wonderfu l and valuable thing in the world , isn't it? Youth is 
life and all that life has to offer. We of the younger generation know that very 
well . But the clock keeps ticking. ." . 

The Mission Playhouse got its new yea r of( to a g<J?d. start With Sweet Bird of 
Youth " the thi rd of three in its current Tennessee Williams festival. For the next 
six w~ekends it will play in repertory with "Streetcar amed Desire" at Old 
Town 's Mission Playhouse. . -

The play concerns a has-been and a never-was, wa shed up on the sands of time. 
Mimette Ehrenfreund plays a desperate movie actress trying to make a 
comeback af ter the loss of the youthful good looks that had been her stock and 
trade. Equally desperate is her hanger-on, played by Buddy Ashbrook, who's on~y 
ambition is to make good in the eyes of his townsmen as a youthful star . HIS 
ta lent is insufficie nt, while his years have become increasingly too sufficient. . 

Ashbrook's talent, fortunately, is quite sufficient for the role. He and MISS 
Ehrenfreund are to be congratulated for doing a good job of b~ingi~~ out these 
souls in their crises of li fe values. The SA DIEGO UNION musIc CrItic , who for 
some reason covered the play, suggested that they would have done better ha.d 
they resorted to "shouting, breast beating and chewing up the scenery." Tha~ IS 
all very well for Italian opera, but this would have lost the- soul-numbmg 
subtleties of human despair that Williams intended. and which they managed to 
convey. . 

In the Gulf Coast town where they are bogged down, Boss Finley is a corrupt 
and racist politician of the old southern school who in his own way reflects on the 
values of youth. Howard Muhleman wasn't fully able to project the character, 
unfortunately, but he gave us some of its force. Robert Larson ca~e on very well 
as Boss Finley's son, giving us his cold toadish character. In a bnef but moving 
part, Martha Shorten as Aunt Nonnie did extremely well reflecting the life style 
that the would-be star gave up. 
This is noUhe best of Williams plays, as it does not fully integrate the thought 

development, but it is powerful drama , currently presented in a production 
which, on the whole, is well done. . 

Certainly we all , even (or especially ) the young , must come to terms With the 
passage of time. The has-been actress manages to do this, but the would~be young 
actor falls apart. How will we handle it? Not recognizing the problem IS part of

Tritons Beat Biola, 
On Route to All Cal 

Mike Roth 
Writer Sporls 

The Tritons defeated a highly-rated Biola team last Monday 
with a score. of ~ to 74. This was a warm-up for the All Cal 
Tourney, whIch IS to take place this weekend. The game held 
in the smog up ~ t Biola, was ~he last?f a two game road trip. 

San DIego displayed an ImpressIve offense, hitting shots 
from all parts of the court for 49 per cent from the floor . The 
Tritons were especially hot from the free throw line, making 28 
of 34 attemptsfor 82 per cent. This trend started a few games 
before, and since t~en the team has consistently shot above 80 
per c~nt. At one pomt, between the Southern California College 
and BIOla games, the Tritons made 23 free throws in a row. 

Ag.ain ~rian Todd led all scores with a total of 29 points, 
makmg nme of ten free throws. Jon Lelevier made 18 points 
and was 12 for 14 from the line. The Biola Eagles were led by 
their center, Buddy Gregg, who connected for 22 , and Ron 
Johnson, selected as L.A. college player of the week, who 
scored 20. 
. The Trito~s were down by one at half time, but pulled away 
In the clOSing minutes without too much trouble. Coach 
Cunningham adjusted his defense to a zone for the second time 
this yea.r to stop Johnson. The victory proved costly however, 
as startmg .f~rward S.teve Hoch sustained a chipped bone in his 
foot, - an Injury serIOus enough to keep him out of the All Cal 
Tourney. 

The Triton JV's upped their record to six wins and three 
losses by defeating the Biola Frosh in their first close game of 
the season, UCSD 52, Biola 49. Although the Tritons led at 
halfllme by three, the lead changed hands several times in the 
closing minutes. In the final minute the Eagles led by one until 
Dan Molden scored to put San Diego ahead. The Eagles then 
failed to score on their turn down the court. When UCSD gained 
control of the ball Malcolm King was immediately fouled . He 
then .connected on both free throws to put the game on ice. 
~adlng scorers were Dan Molden, 15 points, and Tom Bruice 
wlt~ 10. The JV team doesn 't play again until next Tuesday 
against Cal Western on their court.

Tritons Host All Col Tourney 
Mike Roth 

Sports Writer 
sa w last year's game wi th Riverside can attest (remember the 
cute white caps?) . Coach Fredd ie Goss will be se~k ing revenge 

~lnce the Highlanders lost the first game of last year's tourney 
In the last few seconds a t the hands of the Tritons. The UCSD basketball fans (all twenty-five of them ) will have 

the chance to see a lot of games this weekend as the Tritons 
~ill host the ~ll Cal Basketball Tourney Friday and Saturday 
mghts, featuring UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and 
last year 's winner, UC Davis. 

The second game will hopefully begin at 8:30 p.m., in which 
the Tritons, 8 wins - 4 losses, take on UC Davis, carrying 3 
wins - 9 losses into the match. Although their record isn't too 
impressive, Davis has met some tough competition on the 
road. The boys from Cowtown are led by their 6'1" center Mark 
Underwood , 14 points per game. and guard Steve Fletcher with 
a 13 point game average. 

In the first game Friday night, starting at 6: 30 p.m., the 
Irvine Anteaters put their 8 and 5 record on the line aga inst the 
RiverSide HIghlanders. coached by ex-UCLA Bruin Freddie 
Goss. The Anteal~rs are led by 6'5" forward Phil Rhyne, who is 
currently averaging 19.4 points a game , and 6'6" forward Bill 
Moore, who close ly follows Rhyne with a 17.2 point average. 
Although the Highlanders placed high in CAA college ranks 
last.year ,. thus far ~hi s season they have just managed a record 
of five .WInS and SIX losses. !'art of the- reason for this losing 
record IS the loss of MIke Reid , a former JC All American who 
transferred to Riverside from Compton, due to injury. UCR is 
led by returning ta rters, Mike Washington, a guard averaging 
almost 20 points per game, and 6'6" forward Howard Lee. The 
strongest part of Riverside's game, however, will come from 
their fans. These hot dogs provide quite a show, as anyone who 

The hosting Triton are riding on the best record of any of the 
teams, with 8 wins and 4 losses. They have played only one of 
the other teams this year, UC Irvine, lOSing by a close margin. 
However, the Tritons will be playing without the services of 
freshman: Steve. Hoch, who was injured during the Biola game. 
HIgh scoring Brian Todd will enter the tourney with the highest 
scoring average, 23 points per game, and he'll be assisted by â¢ 
floor captain Jon LeLevier, who is averaging 12 3 per game. 

Saturday night's first game will be the losers bowl at 6:30 
p.m., followed by the championship game to be held at 8:30 
p.m. between the winners from Friday night' s games. 

Tennis Team Grapplers Win, 59-58 
Builds on 
Youth. 

Youth dominates the UCSD 
tennis team in 1971. Of the 24 
men on the practice only four 
are upper-classmen. FOl,lr of 
the first five positions on the 
ladder are held by- freshmen 
and sophomores. 

Coach Tad Yamaguchi feels 
his young team shows a lot of 
promise, not only for this year, 
but also for 1972 and 1973. The 
Triton's first match will be the 
All -Cal Tournament at 
Berkeley February :)-6. The 
schedule includes UCLA, UC 
Irvine, Cal , and consistent 
NAIA winner Redlands.

earthly phenomena, he says. 
The next Apollo flight, ran 

the speculation, will land in the 
highlands of the moon, where 
scientists hope they may find 
rocks thrown up from below 
the crustal layer. Such samples 
could help answer questions 
about internal composition and 
temperatu re, and might 
explain the low density of the 
moon as compared to the earth 
and sun. 

SCientifically interesting, the 
scientists agree; but they also 
agree on the complete lack of 
economic value of the moon, 
and cite an interesting figure : 
it costs 25 cents for every man, 
woman and child in America, 
every time we go to the moon.

If they'd come on horseback, they could have 
been ca lled the Four Horsemen (Plus One ) of 
the Apocablitz. Instead they settled on showing 
up in wrestling tights and head gear, but the 
disguise didn 't make any difference to the other 
eleven teams at the Cal-Tech Invitational 
Wrestling Tournament last Saturday: the five-
horsepower UCSD Blitzmobile wreaked as 
much disaster as if it had been the original 
horsemen. 

Up until the final team score tallies were 
made and UCSD was awarded the firs t place 
trophy, it didn 't look as though the Tritons had a 
chance. Plagued by injuries, the San Diegans 
were only able to ship a seven-man squad 
northward . And that rank was decimated even 
further when Dennis Engel , 150, lost his first 
match to the defending champion in that weight 
class and John Gressard , having pinned his firs t 
158-pound match, was knocked out of the 
tournament in round two. 

So the Triton hopes depended on the 
remaining fi ve. But what a five ! The first thing 
they decided upon was strategy: in a 
tournament of this sort, team points are 
awarded on several contingencies. Ten point 
are given if the wrestler takes first place in his 
weight division, seven for second and four for 
third . Then one advancement point is given for 
each match won and an additional point is 
scored for a pin. Usually the pins make the 
crucial difference, and UCSD was intent on 
making that difference. 

At 126, Jav ier Correa defended his 
championship by again proving himself tops in 
his division , Along the way to the title. he 
racked up 14 team poin ts, 10 for the first place 
and four more for two pins. Last year Correa 
was nicknamed " peedy" after his first college 
match when he pinned in 34 seconds. It looks as 
though he'll have to be renamed "Speedier": 

one of his matches Saturday was ended by hiS 
pin after only 26 seconds. Correa also had the 
superlative honor of being named most valuable 
wrestler of the tournament. 

Bob Wilson at 134 more than honored his 
association with the Horsemen as he rode his 
opponents to death with a devastating leg lock. 
He added another 10 points to the team 
endeavor by taking a seven-point second and 
winni ng three matches. 

If anyone on the team approximates the 
Horseman of War, it's Mike Ditomaso, a 142-
pound package of pure fight. He snarled and 
pounced his way to the championship title in a 
tense final round duel with Pasadena. He too 
left a trail of pi ns in his path and scored 14 team 
points. 

The next specter riding was famine , and 
nobody could better represent starvation than 
Fred Grunewald. Normally a 167-pou nd 
contender , Gru newald ha had weight 
difficulties in wrestling at 190 pounds. He got 
tired of faci ng the giants and decided to lose 11 
pounds the week before the tourney. Having 
subsisted the last three days on three quarts of 
liqu id daily, he was in a nasty mood by weigh-in 
and could hardly wait to bite into some fresh 
meat. He got his chance later In the day as he 
took third in his division , pinned three out of 
four matches. and added nine points to the team 
endeavor. 

It was a strong thrust by the .. Plus One" 
man- John Knapp at I 77-that clinched the title 
for the Tritons. Knapp ' aggres iveness and 
strength powered him into a thIrd place. and he 
put the final drive into the Triton blitz by 
winning one malch and pinning three more. 

The Horsemen galloped through , the dust 
ettled, and when they looked around , the 

Tritons had carried away the first-place 
trophy and left a di mayed Pomona College to 
rellect on the eleven pin which had made the 
difference and cost them the championship by 
one point, 59-58.
