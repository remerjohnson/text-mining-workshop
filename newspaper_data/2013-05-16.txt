According to the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the level of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere recently 
surpassed 400 parts per million, 
marking the highest level reached in 
human history. 

The NOAA recorded this read-
ing on May 9, receiving a reading 
of 400.03 ppm from their station in 
Mauna Loa, Hawaii. UCSD Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography record-
ed a reading of 400.08 ppm during 
that same 24-hour period.

“That increase is not a surprise 
to scientists,” NOAA senior scien-
tist Pieter Tans said in an NOAA 
release. “The evidence is conclusive 
that the strong growth of global 
carbon dioxide emissions from the 
burning of coal, oil and natural gas 
is driving the acceleration.”

Scripps has been providing 
updates on the Keeling Curve, a 
record of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide levels. American scien-
tist Charles Keeling produced the 
Keeling Curve in 1956 to measure 
carbon dioxide. In the last reading, 
from May 12, the carbon dioxide 
concentration was 399.41 ppm. It is 
estimated that the carbon dioxide 
level has not reached such levels 
since the Pliocene epoch, around 

3.2 to 5 million years ago.
“The 400-ppm threshold is 

a sobering milestone and should 
serve as a wakeup call for all of us 
to support clean energy technology 
and reduce emissions of greenhouse 
gases, before it’s too late for our chil-
dren and grandchildren,” Scripps 
oceanographer Timothy Lueker said 
to UCSD News.

Scripps geochemist and Charles 
Keeling’s son, Ralph Keeling, pre-
dicted that if the carbon dioxide 
levels continue to increase at this 

pace, the levels would hit 450 ppm 
in a few decades.

“There’s no stopping CO2 from 
reaching 400 ppm,” Keeling said in 
an NOAA release. “That’s now a 
done deal. But what happens from 
here on still matters to climate, and 
it’s still under our control. It main-
ly comes down to how much we 
continue to rely on fossil fuels for 
energy.”

The Genesee Avenue Interchange 
Project will begin construction 
fall 2013, following a California 
Transportation Committee vote 
approving $8 million in preliminary 
project funding.

The $94 million plan was ini-
tially proposed by Caltrans as part 
of the San Diego Association of 
Government’s 2030 Regional 
Transportation Plan in 2007, a 
fully funded collaboration between 
Caltrans, SANDAG, the city of San 
Diego and local businesses. 

According to Caltrans I-5/SR 76 
Corridor Director Allan Kosup, the 
project — a component of the larger 

North Coast Corridor Program — 
will reduce congestion along La Jolla’s 
Genesee Avenue with the replacement 
of I-5 highway overcrossing, the addi-
tion of auxiliary lanes and the widen-
ing of I-5 access ramps.

“Several years of planning and 
collaborating with the community 
has resulted in this exciting project 
that will improve mobility and pro-
vide better access for travelers in the 
[University City] area,” Kosup said in 
an email to the Guardian. “We look 
forward to breaking ground on the 
project this fall.”

The proposal also includes plans 
for the addition of three miles of 
bicycle paths from Roselle Street to 
Voigt Drive, providing links to UCSD, 
hospitals and employment centers.

“Prior to and upon the start of 
construction, SANDAG and Caltrans 
will be coordinating with UCSD to 
reduce construction impacts and 
encourage carpooling, biking to cam-
pus and other methods of transporta-
tion,” Kosup said.

The Genesee Avenue Interchange 
Project is slated for completion in 
spring 2016. In addition, the $6.5 bil-
lion North Coast Corridor Program 
will begin several other projects 
over the next 40 years, including an 
expansion of the SuperLoop Rapid 
Bus Route and the extension of the 
San Diego Trolley to service UCSD 
and University City.

UC Regents Hosts Last 
Meeting of  the Year

As part of a two-day meeting, the Board of Regents met 
to speak about education policy and fiscal budgets.

By  sarah  moon  senior staff writer

The University of California Board of Regents met on May 15 and 16 at the Sacramento 
Convention Center to discuss the 
fiscal budget, educational policy 
and campus building plans. The UC 
Student Association hosted a press 
conference on the first day to reveal 
its official UCSA 2012–2013 Higher 
Education Report Card for indi-
vidual California state senators and 
state assembly members.

The May 15 meeting featured 
a 20-minute public commenting 
period, an update on the 2013–
2014 budget and a report from UC 
President Mark Yudof regarding the 
state of the University of California 
and a discussion of academic per-
formance indicators.

The meeting comes the day 
after the release of Governor Jerry 

The new Arthur C. Clarke 
Center for Human Imagination at 
UCSD formally opened Tuesday 
May 14 with a public symposium 
titled “Visions of the Future.” 

The symposium, one of several 
opening events, discussed what the 
world might be like 33 years from 
now, in a fashion similar to that of 
late British science fiction author 
Arthur C. Clarke, who published 
his book, 2001: A Space Odyssey, 
discussing the future of the world 33 
years from 1968.

The center itself will largely 
focus on imagination, analyzing 
how it works and its impact on our 
daily lives. Thinkers from multiple 
disciplines as different as technol-
ogy, sociology, politics, medicine 
and literature will be involved in the 
research projects and public lectures 

that the center has already begun 
to plan. 

“This is the outcome of imagina-
tion,” UCSD media arts professor 
and center director Sheldon Brown 
said. “We need a more thought-
ful, deliberative approach to under-
standing how it works.” 

According to creators of the cen-
ter, this symposium and others to 
follow are just the beginning steps of 
a larger exploration of how problem 
solving, creativity and education can 
be improved with a better under-
standing of the imagination.

Tedson Meyers, chairman of 
the Clarke Foundation, said many 
universities responded to the foun-
dation’s request for a permanent 
home of the Center for Human 
Imagination, but UCSD was the best 
suited.

“Its top flight research resources, 
facilities and academic excellence 

in multi-disciplinary collaborations 
within the UC system and beyond 
are ideally suited to approach the 
potential of human imagination 
from a wide range of perspectives,” 
Meyers said in a statement.

Brown said the center would 
also include well-known science 
fiction authors and UCSD alumni 
such as David Brin and Kim Stanley 
Robinson and UC Irvine physicist 
Gregory Benford.

The center’s second major sym-
posium titled “Starship Century” 
will be held on May 21 to May 22 
when some of the world’s brightest 
writers and scientists — including 
Peter Schwartz, Neal Stephenson 
and Robert Zubrin — gather at 
UCSD to discuss the possibility of 
space travel in this century.

The new UCSD center for human imagination formally opened Tuesday, May 14.

Construction breaks ground after a CTC approval of $8 million in starting funds.

Imagination Center Holds Symposium

Genesee Interchange Project Begins

Yes; you guessed it. Aleks is sick. 
However, she will be back. Until we 
find a new columnist, that is.

Today’s meeting was fairly low key, 
and around 7 p.m., I found myself 
nodding off to the calming voice of 
the A.S. Advisor and Daily Operations 
Manager 
Hayley Ryan 
as she read roll 
call each time 
a resolution 
amendment 
was proposed.

Fortunately, I found a snack. 
That, coupled with VP Finance Sean 
O’Neal’s colorful outbursts, kept me 
going for the rest of the evening.

The meeting began with special 
presentations, with the A.S. Women’s 
Commission speaking about their 
goals for next year, hoping to continue 
their “Take Back the Night” sexual 
awareness event and urging council 
to become more involved with their 
initiatives.

Council then reordered to exter-
nal news for exactly two minutes. I 
watched as council watched a one-
minute video clip titled “One-Minute 
BBC News,” complete with a one-
minute advertisement for Chevron, 
which they saw to completion.

Council, invest in AdBlock, please. 
In fact, it’s free.

Outgoing AVP Concerts and 
Events Eric Babajanian and Designate 
Sarah Harley made a short appearance 
to present about the upcoming plans 
for A.S. Concerts and Events, includ-
ing the production of more revenue-
producing shows and improvements 

in visibility for A.S. 
Babajanian also men-
tioned the addition of 
the “T.O. Experience” 
at Sun God Festival 
2013, a Triton-

Outfitters sponsored tent that will fea-
ture a photo booth, merchandise and 
artist signings.

During New Business, council 
voted unanimously to stand in soli-
darity with UC patient care workers 
during their impending strike on May 
21 and 22, passing a resolution titled 
“Resolution in Support of the May 21 
and 22 American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
3299 Patient Care Workers’ Strike.”

Way to go, council.
The meeting was adjourned 

shortly afterward (shout-out to A.S. 
for promoting the Guardian’s Sun God 
Block Party), following an announce-
ment that Starbucks will replace Cafe 
Roma in the near future.

Perhaps I will purchase some of 
that Starbucks the next time I cover 
the A.S. council meeting.

Fleeting thoughts By Irene Chiang

Quite Frankly By Lior Schenk

Brown’s revised 2013–2014 state 
budget.

“We all appreciate the priority 
given to higher education and the 
interest the governor is showing 
in the university,” Regents chair 
Sherry Lansing said. “At the same 
time, there are still additional unmet 
needs that we feel are critical to our 
students’ success into achieving long 
term financial stability for [the] UC 
[system].”

Regents discussed financial 
goals, including the increase of state 

reinvestment, administrative cross 
savings and new revenue streams 
as well as addressed the issues sur-
rounding the recent threat of strike 
by UC medical care employees.

“First I want to assure the mem-
bers of the UC community and the 
public that the university adminis-
tration is working to avert a strike,” 
Yudof said. “Beyond that, the uni-
versity seeks a legal injunction in 
the hopes of minimizing any effects 
on patients and their families and to 
let no one in this room be unaware 
that this is a threat to the safety of 
the patients.”

UCSA’s press conference featured 
the presentation of this year’s grade 
for each member of the California 
State Legislature. UCSA’s first annu-
al Higher Education Report card 
grades legislators on their votes for 
UCSA sponsored bills and student-
friendly legislation.

The conference was led by UCSA 
President Raquel Morales, an under-
graduate student at UCSD. UC stu-
dent leaders from UC Irvine and UC 
Santa Cruz were also present.

“UC students are excited to intro-
duce our 2013 Higher Education 
Report Card,” Morales said in a 

UCSA press release. “The report 
card will assign a letter grade from 
A to F to all state senators and 
assembly members based on their 
support for higher education. The 
public should know who in the leg-
islature has stood with students and 
supported higher education.” 

Thursday’s meeting included a 
closed session by the special com-
mittee to consider the selection of 
a president who will succeed Yudof 
after his end of tenure this August.

Drowning in Debt

Thousands of frontline workers 
at all five University of California 
medical centers will strike at the 
end of this month as a last resort 
response to the UC medical centers’ 
refusal to pay a fair wage and pro-
vide livable benefits. Negotiations 
have been going on since September, 
and the UC medical centers must 
resolve the gridlock. UC admin-
istrators need to reallocate funds 
to resolve wage inequality and put 
patients first. 

The American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees 3299 has been campaign-
ing for better wages for hospital 
technicians, vocational nurses and 
service workers. The UC Health 
System previously proposed the 
union annual wage increases of 
up to 3.5 percent for the next four 
years, on top of unspecified health 

and pension benefits, but these 
offers aren’t enough. For a union 
member who has worked in a UC 
hospital for 20 years, the grand total 
of these allowances amounts to a 
paltry $19,000 annual pension — 
not including further deductions for 
health care premiums. 

This cavalier treatment of hos-
pital workers is a stark contrast to 
the generous salaries of the highest-
paid UC executives who take home 
$300,000 annually. In an ironic twist, 
36 of these executives even had the 
audacity to threaten to sue the UC 
system in 2010 when UC President 
Mark G. Yudof wanted to cap their 
pensions at $183,000.

Examples of this irresponsibil-
ity can be found elsewhere. Under 
the same deficient oversight that 
has granted an extra $100 million 
to executive salaries since 2009, the 

UCSD Student Health Insurance Plan 
has operated at a yearly loss and has 
accrued a staggering $57 million debt.

Finances are not the only issue, 
though. With the UC medical cen-
ters’ unwillingness to negotiate an 
agreement and nurses and techni-
cians out on the picket lines, patient 
health is jeopardized.

The mudslinging over this 
issue has already commenced, with 
the UC medical centers accus-
ing AFSCME of using patients as 
bargaining chips to avoid the real 
issue of pension reform. However, 
AFSCME has already proven its 
willingness to forego traditional lines 
in the sand with a patient protection 
task force that will tend to patients’ 
emergency needs during the strike. 
The union has also committed to 
giving a 10-day notice before the 
strike, which will allow medical cen-

ters time to find replacements.
In contrast, the UC medical cen-

ters have not shown such concern. 
The medical centers have a history of 
laying off career workers and replac-
ing them with temporary workers 
who have far less experience, but also 
cost much less to have on board. Until 
the university hospitals can demon-
strate that their hiring practices are in 
the best interests of their patients, and 
not the money in their pockets, they 
have no justification to accuse others 
of jeopardizing patient care.

Back in February, UCSD students 
joined a group of AFSCME workers 
in protest of the low wages that the 
UC system doles out to the work-
ers who take care of patients. These 
students should be commended for 
recognizing this injustice, and more 
students should voice their support 
on May 21 to May 22.

UC Medical Systems Must Reform Pensions to Prioritize Patients

The stories of indebted college graduates unable to marry and start families, let alone buy houses or start businesses, have become 
all too common. Second only to mortgages, student 
loans comprise the largest debt of U.S. households 
— after aggregate auto loans, credit cards and home-
equity debt balances. The numbers are sobering: 
According to the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, the average debt for graduating seniors is 
$26,000, and national student debt has tripled in the 
past eight years to surpass $1.1 trillion. It gets more 
grim: On July 1, interest rates on federally subsidized 
Stafford student loans is set to double from 3.4 
percent to 6.8 percent, costing the average student an 
additional $1,000 per year.

Many lawmakers on both sides of the political 
spectrum agree that the looming interest rate hike is 
senseless and avoidable. For any progress to be made, 
however, House Democrats and Republicans must 
translate this sentiment into compromise. Congress 
needs to attack this political football and set a long-
term solution before last year’s rate extension expires. 
A bill introduced by House Education and Workforce 
Committee Chairman John Kline (R-Minn.) last 
Thursday could serve as the basis for a plausible 
solution.

Kline’s legislation, called the Smarter Solutions 
for Students Act, supports President Obama’s 2014 
fiscal request to set student loan rates based on the 
financial market, but differs in that it sets a cap at 
8.5 percent for Stafford loans and 10.5 percent for 
PLUS loans to calm fears of runaway rates. The 

bill would apply to all federal student loans (except 
Perkins loans) and would base student loans on 
10-year Treasury notes. The resolution falls in line 
with Obama’s budget proposal, demonstrating a 
growing agreement that a market-based approach is 
more reasonable than allowing Congress to continue 
setting interest rates. Keeping rates subject to 
campaign promises is shortsighted because it creates 
uncertainty for student borrowers in the long haul.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, 
the Smarter Solutions for Students Act would save 
the government $990 million over five years and 
$3.7 billion over 10 years. This proposal ensures that 
students can take advantage of lower interest rates 
when available, and furthermore protects against 
overly-inflated rates by enforcing a ceiling. 

Under the current law, most borrowers are 
saddled with high interest rates that do not reflect 
low interest rate periods in the economy. Market 
rates are expected to rise over the next five years, 
with the 10-year note expected to increase to 4.9 
percent in 2017. With the 2.5-percent add-on as set 
in Kline’s proposal, the rate would theoretically rise 
above the doubled rate of 6.8 percent and land at 7.4 
percent — but the cap would help stabilize federal 
loan programs. If this proposal became law, college 
graduates could also opt to take out a consolidation 
loan, which would allow them to lock in the same 
interest rate for the life of the loan.

The bill ends temporary reprieves and will 
provide stability to low- and middle-income students

Make Sure 
You Take
the Easy
Way Out

As most exam takers can attest, the paralyzing feeling of cluelessness on consecutive 
“impossible” problems is perhaps the 
most diabolical punishment one can 
endure. When we casually think “I’ll 
save this one for later” on a midterm 
question and proceed to the next one 
only to do the same thing, the world 
suddenly begins closing in on us. Our 
body heats up, our feet start shift-
ing uncomfortably, and an icy sweat 
envelops us. The feeling of debilitat-
ing anxiety caused by that very first 
stumper problem effectively blocks 
us from thinking clearly on all of the 
rest, and we spiral into a stage of test-
induced depression.

Studies in 1967 and 1975 by 
University of Pennsylvania psycholo-
gist Martin Seligman attribute such 
despair to a condition called “learned 
helplessness.” Seligman theorized 
that exposure to events or challenges 
beyond our control (such as that 
seemingly impossible question 13) 
leads to a decrease in learning ability 
and abject despondency. When faced 
with a quandary that all our hours of 
study can’t solve, we subconsciously 
conclude that our best efforts have 
become futile. As a result, we are less 
inclined to try to our full capacity 
on the following problems and rap-
idly dive into a rut of despair usually 
manifested as ceiling staring.

This gloomy attitude of helpless-
ness and resignation was initially 
seen during Seligman’s experiments, 
in which two groups of dogs were 
exposed to electrical shocks. The dogs 
in the first group were given control 
of their situation through the ability 
to press a button and thus stop the 
shocks for both groups. Those in the 
second group, though, had to rely on 
the first group’s button-pressing to 
avoid discomfort. When later given a 
basic learning exercise, the dogs of the 
first group solved the problems faster. 
Those of the second group, how-
ever, whimpered and flopped on the 
ground, convinced that any effort on 
their part would be worthless.

As we are inveterate despairers, 
our lives are often plagued by similar 
situations. And unfortunately for us, 
the mentality of relative impotence 
has far-reaching consequences, even 
beyond the demoralizing stretch of 
missed answers on the Scantron. 
Many health challenges such as seden-
tary lifestyles or dieting problems are 
hard to overcome because people have 
no faith in their ability to improve. 
Similarly, students who have had dif-
ficulty with certain subjects (cough, 
cough calculus) establish a mental 
block in their minds and struggle to 
learn that subject in the future, even 
when attempting easy problems.

It is certainly easy, and even 
somewhat gratifying, to succumb 
to the forces of despondency. This 
is especially true when camped out 
at a desk in the middle of the night 
attempting to decipher some inscru-
table concepts. As we laze about feel-
ing sorry for ourselves because of one 
lapse in understanding, we are all too 
ready to give up and resign ourselves 
to bittersweet defeat.

But rest assured, there’s a simple 
way to evade this morass of anguish: 
Heed the words that the California 
Standardized Testing and Reporting 
Test instructions have had every 
year since the 2nd grade. Just do the 
easy ones first. You’ll stare at the 
ceiling a lot less.

Do have a sober/non-Sun God-attending friend drive to 

Vallarta Express. Carne Asada Fries go well with the occasion.
Do have some “protection” on you or get ready to be deployed. 

Anything goes during Sun God.
Do be prepared in case you get separated from the crowd; wear a lanyard 
with a card with your name and an emergency contact’s phone number.
Do drink coconut water. Even though it tastes like booty sweat, it is good juice 
for hangovers.
Do all your homework due for this week and the next week by Thursday 
night, so you have nothing to worry about for the weekend.
Do have a secret knocking system for invited guests. It will maintain your safe 
haven from RSOs and campus police.
Do remember that shuttles stop running at 12:30 a.m. if you live off cam-
pus.
Do find some mode of transportation if you’re off campus since buses tend to 
be pretty packed.
Do remember the best way to get rid of a Sun God hangover is ... to keep 
drinking.
Do have a set meet-up point in case people get separated, because cell phone 
reception at RIMAC field is terrible.
Do be aware that there will be increased police presence monitoring the 
area for a six-mile radius checking for DUIs.
Do know we will have new special drug recognition police officers, so if you’re 
passed out on drugs, there will be people who can recognize those drugs and 
deal with it appropriately. (But this also means a higher risk of you just getting 
sent straight to jail.)
Do be careful. The lady in charge of detox will be stricter about sending 
people straight to the hospital if she’s worried about their health and also 
sending people straight to jail if they’re going to be belligerent.
Do start early, finish late. Go. All. Out.

Don’t get too messed up early in the day. It’s not a 
sprint — it’s a marathon.
Don’t lose your friends for the entire day.

Don’t pass out on the lawn or sit by the fence and look terrible. They 
will arrest you.
Don’t yell “Idaho” — it’s bad grammar. 
Don’t sit on someone’s shoulders, a security guard will tell you to get 
down.
Don’t stand directly next to a speaker; you’ll risk permanent damage to 
your ears.
Don’t lose your dignity — or try hard to retain at least a semblance of it.
Don’t take a nap. You probably won’t wake up.
Don’t party with red wine. You’ll get worse hangovers that way.
Don’t use beer as a chaser. Whatever you ate that morning will come back 
up the exact same way it went down.
Don’t be preoccupied with texting ... your phone will die, and you’ll be stuck at 
a charging station.
Don’t send drunk texts.
Don’t do anything stupid. You’re here to have fun, not to have your head lined 
with stitches after slipping and hitting your head in IRPS.
Don’t stand still — jump around and dance.
Don’t assume that the main headliners are the only reason to go! There’s a 
reason why each artist on the Sun God lineup is chosen.
Don’t skimp on the plastic bags.
Don’t forget to stock up on Gatorade and Advil.
Don’t forget your name and where you live. It could help the people helping 
your drunk self.
Don’t leave a belligerent drunk friend in a crowd. You might not see him or her 
for a couple of days.
Don’t forget to eat a hearty breakfast. You want to last the entire Sun God. 
It’s barf prevention.
Don’t remember anything. Except the great time you had.
Don’t fall in love. Sun God relationships aren’t real.
Don’t leave your suite door open, and cover your windows with paper bags. If 
you need fresh air, go out one at a time but don’t be loud.
Don’t try to real-talk a security guard.
Don’t find yourself without Clorox wipes, a mop and plastic bags on hand. Go 
to Ralph’s or CVS the night before to prepare for post-Sun God cleaning.
Don’t walk around with a giant duffle bag ... we all know what’s inside of it.
Don’t forget to bring cash for the food booths.
Don’t be that person who only knows “Swimming Pools” by Kendrick 
Lamar.
Don’t get lost (yes, it’s RIMAC field, and no, you can’t REALLY get lost).
Don’t let your friends go home with a stranger.
Don’t sneak kegs and stuff into your apartment the day of. There are going to 
be new security cameras installed in North Campus, focusing a lot on the 
Village.
Don’t perform oral sex on any of the artists.
Don’t use your fake I.D. to buy alcohol at local stores. They 
know when Sun God is and they will be on 
alert.

Just as it did with Macklemore 
and Ryan Lewis, UCSD has likely 
booked another act that is just about 
to become an international hit. After 
two years of constant rehearsing, 
songwriting and reputation-building, 
Youngblood Hawke is positioned to 
explode onto the music scene in the 
next few months. “Wake Up,” the 
band’s debut album, climbed to 58th 
place on the Billboard 200 after its 
debut on April 30, and lead single “We 
Come Running” can be heard regular-

ly on modern rock and pop stations.
The attention is well deserved 

— Youngblood Hawke spent years 
honing a warm, poppy sound worthy 
of commercial success. Their music 
is heavily layered, containing over-
dubbed vocals, bright synth sounds, 
acoustic and electric guitar, grand 
piano and even children’s choir and 
xylophone as heard in “We Come 
Running.” The result is a sound that, 
while very densely arranged, remains 
clear, straightforward and beautiful.

Most of the songs by these Echo 
Park natives sound vibrant and upbeat 
even when the lyrics can be somber or 
heavy.  According to lead singer Sam 
Martin, this is what comes to them 
most naturally.

“Sometimes, we’ll have some 
darker lyrics, and we like to balance 
that happy music in the background,” 
he said in an interview with the 
Guardian. “It’s just fun for us to per-
form that style of music, and it’s what 
we’re attracted to. I don’t think we set 
out specifically to sound really posi-
tive and upbeat, but that’s just what 
makes us feel something.”

Though their music fits some-
where within the modern pop and 
rock genres, their influences and 
favorite acts range from Radiohead 
to classic rock and roll.

“[If I could work with any art-
ist], I would like to work with Mick 
Jagger,” Martin said. “To work with 
him back in the day would be a 
dream come true.”

Martin is also excited to be one 
of the bands opening for Sun God 
headliner Kendrick Lamar.

“[‘good kid, m.A.A.d. city’] is 
one of my favorite albums,” he said. 
“I really like his lyrics. They’re very 
intelligent and storytelling-driven, 
and I love it.”

With such a diverse apprecia-
tion for music, it makes sense that 
Youngblood Hawke defies fitting 
neatly into a genre.

“I think we all kind of have indi-
vidual styles, and I think we’re all 
really close,” Martin said. “I think the 
thing that we want to get across is 
that we’re a really tight-knit group of 
people who are insanely passionate 
about creating music together.”

This attitude is precisely what has 
helped Youngblood Hawke advance 
in terms of sound and popularity, 
and it will likely help them become 
one of the most popular bands in 
modern rock.

Hailing from North Carolina, 
20-year-old Porter Robinson has 
already achieved more than most 
EDM artists do throughout their 
career. Inspired at age 13 by video 
game sounds from “Dance Dance 
Revolution,” Robinson taught him-
self how to mix as he slowly built an 
online following via his releases on 
Beatport. In 2011, during his senior 
year of high school, he signed a deal 
with Skrillex’s label, OWSLA, and his 
first single “Language” brought him 
near-immediate success in the elec-
tronic scene.

Robinson kicked off his career as 
a touring musician in 2011 by playing 
for huge crowds at esteemed festivals, 
including Electronic Daisy Carnival 
and South by Southwest. While tour-
ing as the opening act for Tiesto later 
that year, Robinson remained level 
headed despite his newfound success, 

managing to play house parties on 
tour as chronicled in a mini-docu-
mentary on YouTube.

Showing no sign of slowing down, 
Robinson tackled the European 
scene in 2012, playing for audiences 
abroad at Tomorrowland in Belgium. 
Meanwhile, in the U.S., he became a 
staple artist in the electronic scene, 
which earned him a prominent spot 
at Coachella.

Robinson has dubbed his fresh 
blend of electro house as “complextro” 
due to the massive amounts of cuts, 
skips and transitions in the music. 
Utilizing hundreds of sound clips 
and effects, it coalesces into a heavy 
beat that keeps the crowd going but 
has enough melodic and harmonic 
content layered on top to please more 
sober concertgoers.

If you’re not convinced of this 
youngster’s prowess yet, this might 

do the trick: Robinson was booted 
last month from Matador Music 
Festival, allegedly because his 
music was inciting the crowd to 
riot.

Get ready, UCSD.

Kendrick  lamar

sun  god  Artists  
2013

It makes sense to have a west 
coast rapper headline Sun God. The 
sun is out. It’s basically summer. 
Sun God has all the makings of a 
day like Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good 
Day.” It’s a break from school’s usual 
oppressive monotony, a celebration 
of dodging tests and essays instead 
of bullets and police. But for the past 
decade or so, west coast rap has been 
pretty dormant. For those who still 
prostrate themselves on the altar of 
the California scene, the 2000s were 
a rough time. You can only play “Gin 
and Juice” so many times before it 
gets old.

Luckily for all these poor nos-
talgic souls, the West is back at Sun 
God. In fact, the West in general is 
back, mostly due to the impressive 
efforts of our beloved headliner, 
Kendrick Lamar. The Compton rap-
per received the west coast torch 
from Dr. Dre and has infused the 
otherwise stale subgenre with a vital-
ity that’s been missing for years.

Lamar’s major debut, “Good Kid, 
m.A.A.d. City,” put this vitality on 
full display. Released in October 
2012, the album has received acco-
lades from just about everyone. 
The album has gone gold, topped 
numerous “Best of ” lists (including 
Pitchfork’s and the BBC’s), and came 
in second on Billboard’s annual best 
albums list.

While some of this acclaim is 
due to the hype from Dre publicly 
anointing Lamar the future of the 
West, most of it is because Lamar 

is talented. His raps are clever. He 
shifts tempos, rhyme schemes and 
personas with ease. He raps about 
conflicting impulses. He talks about 
shooting people and partying and 
then bows into a prayer without 
betraying any insincerity. Even 
“Swimming Pools (Drank),” which 
on the surface seems like a light-
hearted celebration of alcohol, subtly 
explores the darker parts of drinking 
and alcoholism. “Some people like 
the way it feels/ Some people wanna 
kill their sorrows/ Some people 
wanna fit in with the popular/ That 
was my problem,” he rhymes, turn-
ing an ostensible party anthem 
into a meditation on the art of peer 
pressure — and making “Swimming 
Pools” an appropriate anthem for 
Sun God.

What helps Lamar discuss these 
topics without sounding preachy is 
his storytelling ability. He couches 
what would otherwise be moralistic 
preaching in personal narratives. 
In fact, “Good Kid, m.A.A.d. City” 
is such a cohesive narrative that it’s 
almost hard to listen to individual 
songs. This autobiographical touch 
lends his work a poignancy that 
makes it all the more powerful.

All of this makes Kendrick Lamar 
a great Sun God act: He brings a 
lot of emotional power to the stage 
while still being a dope enough rap-
per to not kill anyone’s vibe.

Portugal.  the  man
Imagine an Alaska without Sarah 

Palin, and you’ll see many other nice 
things, particularly the beautiful 
landscape, giant king salmon, igloos 
and the unapologetic style created 
by the boys of Portugal. The Man. 
By synthesizing the cooled-off steel 
drumming sounds of the Beach 
Boys, heavy guitar licks a la Jane’s 
Addiction and lyrical poetics akin 
to Bon Iver, Portugal. The Man is 
hard to pigeonhole, whether it be 
through style, delivery or work ethic. 
Having already released six albums 
since their 2006 debut (along with 
a 13-minute short film that uses the 
songs “Sleep Forever” and “Got It 
All” as narration to a haunting tale 
set in the Alaskan tundra) PTM has a 
flair for grandeur. 

While present-day pop might have 
laid waste to eardrums everywhere, 
Portugal. The Man — though swept 
up by big business Atlantic Records 
— has maintained its offbeat, unique 
sound while still being accessible to 
mainstream listeners.

Co-founded by John Gourley 
(vocalist/songwriter) and Zach 
Carothers (bass player/vocalist), 
Portugal. The Man soon moved out 
of the wilderness and into the hip-
ster’s homeland of Portland, Oregon, 
gaining members Kyle O’Quin, Noah 
Gersh and, eventually, Kane Ritchotte.

Their latest album, “Evil Friends” 

(out 
June 
4), 
cer-
tainly 
main-
tains 
the 
band’s 
knack 
for 
spec-
tacle. 
After 
news 
that pro-
ducer Brian 
“Danger Mouse” 
Burton (heralded for 
his work with Gnarls Barkley, 
The Black Keys and Cee Lo Green) 
was interested in collaborating, 
Portugal. The Man scrapped over 
10 songs and two weeks of record-
ing time to work with him. The 
result retains PTM’s varied sounds 
and loner lyrical themes (i.e. “Creep 
in a T-Shirt”) while incorporating 
radio-friendly (and blunt-friendly) 
hip-hop and hook-heavy elements 
(“Hip-Hop Kids” and “Purple 
Yellow Red and Blue,” respectively), 
making PTM a band that can 
appeal to fans across genres.

That’s the rub, really. Whatever 
style Portugal. The Man aims to 

infuse — be it pop, electronic, hip-
hop or blues — their strange delivery 
stays prevalent in their work. It’s why 
they’ve gained such a loyal clan of 
followers, from their northeastern 
stomping grounds to Europe to our 
own sunny California. At a Sun God 
that will be writhing with drunken, 
sweaty tomfoolery, what better way 
to close the evening off than with a 
heavy dose of that cool Alaskan breeze 
reverberating through the air?

In the wake of a “plug-and-play” 
DJ plague that has inspired a new 
breed of DIY house music, good ol’ 
classic turntables would seem like 
a dying art. Not to Geo-D though. 
Fresh out of San Francisco, DJ Geo 
“Geo-D” Del Carmen gets back to 
basics, rooting his style in now-
vintage turntablism to create some 
of the best progressive electronica 
this side of the Mississippi. Working 
from age 13 without leaning on the 
play button other artists so frequently 
depend upon, Geo-D has made a 
name for himself by honing a heavy-
hitting house style comprised of 
complex rhythms and breakdowns 
that will make even the biggest dub-
step fans swoon.

In 2012, Geo-D left his mark on 
the industry after he participated in 
Macworld’s first DJ contest in San 
Francisco, “RISE,” and earned praise 
for his back-to-the-roots turntabling. 
Having played alongside electronic 
greats such as Ferry Corsten, Apl.
de.Ap and Will.I.Am of the Black 

Eyed Peas, Geo-D has built himself 
a clear path into the spotlight. Now 
remixing and producing his own 
tracks, Geo-D’s musical artistry and 
track selection during his live sets 
reflect the crowd’s higher-than-life 
reaction to the music.

The point is: DJ Geo-D was made 
to make you dance, and Sun God was 
made for dancing. So get to it.

A piece of lore is stewing out there 
about Danny Brown: He received oral 
sex on stage during an April 26 show 
in Minneapolis and kept on rapping, 
making him either a disgusting pig 
or an unexpected victim of sexual 
assault, depending on your opinion. 
It’s easy to see why people would rush 
to consider the former, though, since 
Danny Brown is more of a charac-
ter than a real man, and unsolicited 

chicks grabbing dicks lies squarely 
in the sphere of fantasy.

Consider the way he looks,  
— tongue out, skinny jeans, car-
toonishly choppy hair sprouting 
in every direction — he seems 
like precisely the type of guy to 
respond to public falatio from 
a stranger with nothing but a 
gap-toothed grin. Of course, 
sexual assault victims come in 
all shapes and sizes (and races 
and genders), and it’s never 
fair to make assumptions about 
them. Regardless, the incident 
may turn Brown’s Sun God set 
into a spectacle of curiosity that 
will make his cutthroat perfor-
mance all the more shocking to 

those uninitiated to his crew, the 
Bruiser Brigade.

Danny Brown is, after all, an 
off-kilter playboy. Screaming 
about fucking while “higher than 
Swizz Beats’ hairline,” his music is 
both sexual and substance-abused 
and his voice is the same: a high-
pitched, nasal yelp bred from a 
heavy diet of Adderall and women. 

His most recent album, 2011’s 
“XXX,” is a hedonistic trip through 

the streets of his hometown of 
Detroit, Michigan, at once expos-
ing the trappings of the crumbling 
city and the vices it supplies. On 
album highlight “DNA,” he admits 
over plaintive horns that addiction 
is “in my D.N.A., cos my pops used 
to get fucked up the same way.” On 
“Fields” he takes on Detroit itself: 
“We living in the streets where 
options is limited / Because there’s 
burnt buildings instead of jobs and 
businesses,” — making it clear that 
the drugged-out bravado of much 
of the album (the pinnacle of which 
is “I Will,” a salacious ode to oral 
sex over a pitched-up female vocal 
sample) is a failed means of escap-
ing the sludge of the Motor City. 

Yet us hardcore Bruisers know: 
Despite Danny Brown’s raw back-
ground, the 32-year-old rapper is a 
gleeful performer. Though much of 
his crotch-grabbing ego is tongue-
in-cheek, he’s the perfect man to 
command the beer-soaked, horny 
masses of Sun God.

A man of many titles, piano-
pop artist Andrew McMahon has 
remained beloved in an industry 
notorious for its wavering taste 
in artists. After selling millions of 
records as the former frontman 
of piano-rock bands Something 
Corporate and Jack’s Mannequin, 
McMahon is now trying his own 
name out for size.  With the addi-
tion of his alternative pop inspired 
solo EP “The Pop Underground” 

to an already booming catalogue of 
rock music, McMahon is showing no 
signs of slowing down.

“It’s endless, I guess,” McMahon 
said to the Guardian. “I’ve been 
doing it for so long. I’ve been on 
the road for 11 to 12 years now.” 

McMahon recently completed 
an extensive 25-date U.S. tour and 
will follow it up by a tour in the 
U.K. Since Something Corporate’s 
inception in 1998, McMahon has 
invented and reinvented his iden-
tity and music in line with the 
developing tastes of his fans.

This transition from band front-
man to solo act shows through in 
McMahon’s newest tracks. Songs 
like “After the Fire” exhibit a shift 
from the piano-rock era into far 
more upbeat synth-inspired pop 
that brings the summer heat out 
early in time for Sun God.

“As far as this record goes, I 
think there was a lot of joy in its 
creation, and there was a lot of 
freedom in sort of cutting loose 
of some heavier subject matters,” 
McMahon said.

Despite having lived on the east 
coast until eighth grade, south-
ern California represents what 
McMahon calls his “promised 
land.” Orange County is home to 

both Something Corporate and 
Jack’s Mannequin and the inspira-
tion for songs like “Miss California” 
where a “boxcar on the beach” is 
where the real fun resides. 

“You hear quite a bit of regular 
references to southern California and 
living by the beach, and, for me, I 
pull a lot of my personal inspiration 
and creative inspiration from the 
Pacific Ocean,” McMahon said.

And with over a decade of mate-
rial to pull from, nothing is off lim-
its come Sun God.

“You can expect a pretty bal-
anced set list between what we’ve 
been doing out on the road this 
past month or so — a pretty good 
amount of Jack’s, Something 
Corporate and also music off this 
new EP,” McMahon said.

With an abundant set list 
that transcends several genres, 
McMahon encourages fans to feel 
the music as much as they hear it.

“For me, I think I like the way 
for people to hear my music is to 
relate to it as personally as pos-
sible,” he said. “I think connection 
is sort of my biggest goal.”

With a mysterious background and 
a musical resume spanning various 
genres, IndO’s presence at Sun God 
will be a chance to catch a rising artist 
in one of his first live performances. 
IndO first began making music at the 
age of 7 and spent his childhood mas-
tering classical pieces on the piano. 
The NorCal native then crossed musi-
cal terrain to become a rock guitarist. 
IndO enjoyed success touring with 
Versus Us and shared the stage with 
acts such as Amber Pacific, Sherwood 
and Quiet Drive. He then wrapped up 
rock and jumped genres again, arriv-
ing at the EDM scene.

IndO set to work for months, 
training in his home studio to per-
fect music production. In 2012, his 
hard work paid off when he won the 

Insomniac Discovery Project’s remix 
contest and premiered at Nocturnal 
Wonderland electronic music festival. 
His feel-good dance single “W.L.I.F.A.” 
earned him a record deal with 
Manufactured Music. IndO’s sound 
strikes a similar chord as Daft Punk 
(such as in “I Wanna”). His heavy 
use of bass synthesizer and rapid 
build-ups are deliberate, focused hits 
of energy that, while aggressive, are 
more measured in comparison to acts 
like The Bloody Beetroots. Having 
finished his EP, “Eviscerate,” IndO is 
heading down to San Diego to enliven 
RIMAC field with driving beats and 
ferocious soundboarding.

From Coachella’s Sahara Dance 
Tent to the grounds of UCSD, we wel-
come Prinz Adrian Johannes Hynne, 
a.k.a. Adrian Lux — someone espe-
cially appealing to the raver crowd. 
This Swedish-born producer and DJ 
is famous for singles “Strawberry” 
and “Teenage Crime,” both of which 
integrate light, catchy beats with 
underlying themes of love and death 
quite akin to the styles of Kaskade and 
Crystal Castles. 

Raised by a punk rocker and a 
filmmaker, Lux was exposed to music 
early on. But it wasn’t until the age of 
17 that he truly took to music with 
Jamaican dancehall music and the 
hip-hop group Dipset as his two major 
obsessions at the time. After a trip to 
Brazil, though, Lux’s style drifted away 
from these reggae and rap subgenres 
to the sentimental EDM and cool elec-
tronic pop that he is famous for today.

Lux’s flamboyant beats have been 
gracing European clubs for the past 
three years. A mix of indie, electronica 
and house, Lux has been shaped by 
(and is now shaping) Sweden’s thriv-
ing music scene from Calvin Harris 
to Avicii.

Lux has already gathered an admi-
rable group of supporters in the DJ 
world from David Guetta to Tiesto, 
and his recent American tour will no 
doubt bring in thousands more fans. 
Bridging the gap between cutting-edge 
pop and rush house, Lux touts a vibe 
unlike any of the other artists set to 
play Sun God. Great things are expect-
ed from this rising star: Don’t be a 
fool and blackout before this Swedish 
sensation.

RAC

In a music scene dominated by 
synth-based pop music and auto-
tuned vocals, RAC keeps it simple. 
Otherwise known as the Remix Artist 
Collective, the group consists of a 
trio of members devoted to remixing, 
mashing and reinterpreting the work 
of other artists. Adding previously 
nonexistent melodies and complexi-
ties to some of today’s greatest hits, the 
group has evolved over time from a 
dorm-room hobby to a major force in 
today’s music industry, taking on any-
thing from indie bands like The Shins 
and Penguin Prison to more main-
stream fare such as Ellie Goulding, 
Radiohead and Lady Gaga.

An underdog college success story, 
the group was founded from the 
ground up through the talents of 
then-sophomore Andre Allen Anjos 
who eventually joined up with fel-
low classmate Karl Kling and New 
York remix artist Andrew Maury. 
Beginning as just a musical passion, 
the “collective” drew the attention 
of big-name artists and record-
ing companies after scoring their 
first big break remixing the song, 
“Sleeping Lessons,” for indie rock 
band The Shins.

“Remixing was just something 
that came pretty naturally,” frontman 

Andre Anjos said in an interview with 
the Guardian. “I just started college 
really not thinking about a career or 
what I’d be doing in life, and all of it 
kind of happened… It’s all been a big 
deviation from the original plan. It’s 
just pure luck to find something that 
sets you apart, and that’s what we did.”

The group’s music focuses less on 
David Guetta-like robot beats and 
utilizes a more equal combination of 
instrumentals and synth.

“Honestly, our goal is just to 
make these songs better – jumping 
around genres and adding the RAC 
sound,” Anjos said. “It’s all about 
trying things out, never really plan-
ning anything, and it’s exciting to 
just see where things go.” 

And where things are going is 
the Sun God Festival, where the 
former college musician will be 
playing for a crowd of thousands of 
UCSD students.

“San Diego has always been a cool 
place for us to hang and play music,” 
he said. “Ever since our days playing 
at the El Dorado, we’ve always had a 
special connection, and we can’t wait 
to try some new stuff at Sun God.”

Halcyon Days By Christie Yi

working to finance college. By 
sweeping the student interest rate 
problem off the table, Congress can 
focus more attention on streamlining 
federal student aid programs.

The fate of this measure, though, 
depends on whether Democrats’ 
skepticism can be dispelled so that 
the bill can enjoy broad bipartisan 
support in the House. Some 
Democrats on the House Education 
Committee are concerned that basing 
rates on the market would actually 
increase the cost of education in the 
coming years. Others are concerned 
about whether Congress could use the 
savings from terminating a decreased 
rate to give low-income students 

larger grants. Still others have set forth 
alternative bills.

While House Republicans and 
Obama are seeking a long-term fix, 
many Democrats in the Senate are 
clamoring instead for a short-term 
extension of the current 3.4-percent 
rate. As total student loan debt 
continues to climb, public university 
tuition has risen 27 percent over 
the past five years, and meanwhile, 
median household income has 
decreased. In California alone, 
inflation-adjusted tuition more 
than doubled in public two-year 
community colleges, and it increased 
by over 70 percent in four-year 
public colleges. The issues raised by 
each senator can be debated when 
the House Committee on Education 

and the Workforce considers 
amendments to Kline’s bill before 
sending it to the House. 

If these trends continue, post-
secondary education will become 
even more unaffordable for a majority 
of students. The debt problem needs 
to be mitigated not just now, but in 
the coming years as well.

Hundreds of thousands of college 
graduates are further delaying buying 
big-ticket items such as cars and 
homes, stifling economic growth. 
An entire generation should not be 
stepping out into their professional 
lives mired in irresolvable debt. 
Obama promised to prevent student 
loan rates from skyrocketing in his 
2012 reelection campaign. Let’s ensure 
that his words translate to actions.

Resolving Student Debt Will Require a Long-Term Solution

letters  to  the  editor

Dear Editor,
Justice in Palestine Week is upon us 

once again. Without adding to the often 
inflammatory rhetoric tossed around, 
I would like to pose a simple question: 
Why not “Justice in the Middle East” 
Week? I’d like to think that’s an event 
everyone on campus could support. 

Israel is certainly far from perfect, 
but it is a robust democracy, which 
struggles as every democracy has. Israel 
is the only country in the region where 
there is full freedom of religion for 
Christians, Jews, and Moslems, Druze, 
Baha’i and numerous others. It has a 
free press and a parliamentary govern-
ment with freely elected Arab and 
Jewish members. 

Meanwhile, the government of 
Syria, which has long imprisoned and 
tortured dissenters, continues to slaugh-
ter its own people. Saudi Arabia severs 
the hands of thieves, executes those 
charged with “sorcery” and punishes 
rape victims with imprisonment. In 
Egypt it is still common for women 
to be harassed as they walk the streets 
and openly declaring homosexuality is 
unsafe. Jordan’s Black September, which 
ended with violent suppression of the 
Palestine-Liberation-Organization-led 
uprising, is not yet a distant memory. 
Iraq, formerly home to a brutal dicta-
torship is now home to internecine reli-
gious and territorial bloodshed. Surely 
these injustices and scores more also 
warrant our attention?

Thomas Friedman of the New 
York Times summed it up concisely 
when he said, “Criticizing Israel is not 
anti-Semitic, and saying so is vile. But 
singling out Israel for opprobrium and 
international sanction — out of all 
proportion to any other party in the 
Middle East — is anti-Semitic, and not 
saying so is dishonest.”

Recent Wars Are Irrelevant 
to Our National Security

Dear Editor,
I understand President Obama’s 

plan is to have all of U.S. troops out 
of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. 
As a lifelong U.S. citizen for over 54 
years, I would like to say the follow-
ing about these two wars, Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and how they relate to 
our nation’s history.

I truly believe that fighting 
World War I and World War II was 
absolutely necessary to our nation’s 
security. I truly do not believe that 
fighting in Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, 
Iraq nor Afghanistan was necessary 
to the security of our nation.

If my understanding of the his-
tory of these wars is correct, Korea 
and Vietnam were fought to prevent 
the spread of Communism to South 
Korea and South Vietnam. The 
war in Kuwait was fought to drive 
Saddam Hussein out of a country 
that he wrongly invaded. The Iraq 
and Afghanistan wars were because 
of 9/11. Considering these five 
countries are so far from the U.S., 
I do not, again, I do not see how 
these wars were even conceivably 
or remotely fought to protect our 
nation’s security.

Now the overpaid, underworked, 
and clueless government officials in 
Washington, D.C. are continuing to 
force tens of thousands of American 
troops into harm’s way for absolutely 
no good reason. The term “nation 
building” has been used to describe 
both Iraq and Afghanistan wars. I 
was of the understanding that this 
was viewed as wrong for a country to 
get involved in.

It is well past time for our so-
called “government officials” to stop 
being war mongers and bring all of 
our troops home to safety and their 
families where they all belong!

Early Exit
UCSD Softball eliminated early from NCAA Division-II Sub Regional.

The UCSD softball team will not 
continue on to the NCAA National 
Tournament. This will be the first time 
in three seasons that the Tritons will 
not advance to the eight-team College 
World Series.

UCSD ended its season at the 
double elimination West Subregional, 
where they lost to Humboldt State 7–1 
in the tournament opener and Grand 
Canyon University 8–3. 

The Tritons lost both matches in 
similar fashion, falling into a five-run 
deficit early in the game that would 
prove to be too deep a hole to emerge 
from. In the first game against reign-
ing California Collegiate Athletics 
Association champions, first-seeded 
Humboldt State, the Lumberjacks 
scored five runs in the first inning on 
three hits, including a two-run homer. 

Senior right-hander Michelle 
Escamilla (3–12) walked three men 
and gave up two hits and five runs in 
just 0.2 innings pitched. Her relief, 
freshman Alexis Edwards, fared bet-
ter over her 4.1 innings but gave up 
back-to-back single-run home runs in 
the fourth.

Possibly in an effort to preserve 
their arms, UCSD head coach Patti 
Gerckens sent out her big guns in game 
two against Grand Canyon University. 
Junior Jennifer Manuel (11–4) started 
for the Tritons, giving up five runs on 
five hits in the second inning. Similarly, 
after the second inning, Edwards was 
summoned, this time surrendering a 
two-run double in the sixth.

Poor pitching — or, rather, poor 
pitching relative to that of last sea-
son’s All-American ace Camille 

Gaito — has been UCSD’s Achilles’ 
heel in 2013. The lineup has not 
changed much since last season, 
with the exception of now-absent 
All-American center fielder Kris 
Lesovsky. UCSD retained All-West 
Region selections junior Caitlin 
Brown and senior Nicole Spangler. 
The Tritons returned All-CCAA 
selections juniors Mya Romero and 
Kristin Willmon, brought on fresh-
man Callie Grant and brought back 
All-CCAA selection redshirt sopho-
more Taylor Sepulveda from the dis-
abled list, but it seemed like the for-
mula that took the Tritons to back-to-
back national tournament title games 
was just a little bit off.

Without Gaito — who recorded 
an unheard of 0.75 ERA in her 2011 
season — to hide behind, UCSD’s 
small-ball tactics couldn’t hold up, 
particularly against conference cham-
pions Humboldt State, which leads the 
nation in home runs per game (107 in 
62 games played).

Regardless, the Tritons (33–25 
overall, 24–12 in the CCAA) still came 
away with some good results. UCSD 
ended regular season play in second 
place behind Humboldt and placed 
seven Tritons on the All-CCAA con-
ference team. The Tritons also took 
the silver bracket title at the Mizuno 
Tournament of Champions held back 
in the beginning of April.

Furthermore, UCSD will only grad-
uate three from its lineup — Spangler, 
Escamilla and Dyanna Imoto — with 
the core group returning and ready for 
next season.

waTER  POlO

The UCSD women’s water polo team had a rough finish to the end of its season this past weekend at the NCAA championships, hosted by Harvard University from May 10 to May 12.The Tritons entered the event as the No. 5 seed but were ousted by No. 4 University of Hawaii. 
Subsequently, UCSD moved into the consolation bracket, beating Pomona-Pitzer before losing to sixth-seeded 
Princeton University in overtime to place sixth.

“Harvard put on an amazing display of our sport. It was very professional,” UCSD team captain and Western 
Water Polo Association Player of the Year Sarah Lizotte said. “They did an amazing job, and we were really lucky 
they were able to host that for us.”

Despite the result, the Tritons had a very successful season, earning their highest-placed finish in UCSD history 
at sixth in the tournament. UCSD also had five tournament titles on the year, and with the full team returning for 
next season, the Triton squad is poised to perform well again in 2014.

“We’re coming back next year with a full squad, and that’s really good for our program,” Lizotte said. “It’s excit-
ing, and it’s something to look forward to. This was a great season, and I’m really proud of my team, and I’m really 
hopeful for next season.”

UCSD opened up the tournament against 
the Big West conference champion squad from 
Hawaii. Hawaii got off to a hot start behind two 
goals from Zoe Respondek. A goal from junior 
Melissa Bartow kept the Tritons close at the end of 
the first quarter, but subsequent 5–1 periods with 
Hawaii on top in the second and third quarters 
put the game out of reach.

“Quite frankly, we just weren’t prepared,” 
Lizotte said. “We weren’t prepared for the physi-
cality. They came out harder and stronger than we 
did, and they just outplayed us in every aspect.”

UCSD was able to outshoot the Rainbow 
Wahine 3–1 in the fourth frame, but the game was 
well out of reach by that point, and the Tritons 
were sent to the consolation bracket. Hawaii 
went on to lose in the next round to the even-
tual NCAA national champion USC and finished 
fourth overall.

In the consolation bracket, UCSD came out strong. 
The Tritons jumped all over Pomona-Pitzer and never 
let them into the game.

“I think after our first performance, we really wanted 
to turn it around,” Lizotte said. “We came out with more 
fire than we did on Friday.”

Lizotte herself came out hot, scoring five goals for 
the Tritons in the first half, propelling UCSD to a 10–5 
halftime lead. Bartow had three goals, and sophomore 
Rachel Brooks added two in the first half to round out 
the scoring. 

In the second half, UCSD continued to pepper the 
net. Brooks picked up another goal. The Triton fresh-
men took control of the remainder as UCSD head coach 
Brad Kreutzkamp utilized his bench to manage minutes. 
Alexis Wieseler threw in two goals, while Julia Kirkland 
and Emma Sasson grabbed one each.

With the win, UCSD moved on to face Princeton 
University in a challenge for fifth place.

Despite getting off to a great start, the Tritons couldn’t 
maintain their momentum and lost to Princeton in over-
time. The Tigers scored the first goal, but three straight 
goals from the Tritons put UCSD on top.

The game was tied at 7–7 going into the fourth quarter, 
but two quick goals from the Tritons and another goal 
from Bartow with 5:39 remaining gave UCSD a 10–7 lead. 
Princeton refused to give up, however, and the Tritons were 
unable to maintain the lead. UCSD gave up three goals in a 
three-minute span to bring the game into overtime.

“We came out in the first half ready to play,” Lizotte 
said. “We went up by three, and it kind of spun downward 
from there.”

Princeton added a point in each overtime period and 
came away with the victory. UCSD failed to build much 
momentum on offense, as fatigue increasingly began to 
show on the Tritons’ side. Early-game foul trouble caused 
the Tritons to play on shortened rotations, and the extra 
minutes slowed them down in the overtime periods.
