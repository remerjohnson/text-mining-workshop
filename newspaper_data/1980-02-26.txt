Earthquake DaDlages Limit~d, 
But LA, Mexico Feel It 

While yesterday's earthquake centered in the 
Santa Rosa Mountains triggered landelides, 
shattered windows and caused at leut one fire 
throughout Southern California, no damages 
were reported at this campus. 

At University Hospital, which had rated 
poorly lut quarter in a UC study judging 
buildinJ( strength 81 related to the mOlt severe 
earthquake that could occur, planning officials 
.aid there were no reports of any darnqe 
resulting from the quake, which measured 5.1 
on the Richter scale. ' 

Roger Smith, s~rvi.or of founds 
maintenance at UCSD, said he has 'had no 
calls of any damage on campus." 

People from Mexico to Loa Angeles were 
awakened by the 2:47am temblor centered in 
the Santa Rosa Mountains near the resort 
hamlet of Sprins Cre.t, about 50 miks 

no~ast of UCSD. 
Within four hours, a dozen aftershocks had 

been reported, five of them .tronger than 3.0 on 

the Richter scale, the strOOJ(est mealUI'IIlII 3.7. 
There were no immediate reports of injury 

from the quake or of damate to newly repaired 
flood control levee. that had been broken in ta.t 
week'. aeries of puniahing stonns, but the 
temblor was felt in Mexico 81 well as six 
California countie •.

miles southeast of Pabn Sp.-iq., cauthl fire 
when the quake broke a natural ,81 line and a

Johnson, who brought · his locialiat 
workers campaign here last night, still 

hal an interest in journa~sm left over 
from his day. as a CBS New. television 
correspondent and a Newsweek strin· 
ger, even though he thinks some of his 
colleague. are di.honest. 

He worked in the Far East in the 
early .ixties for the two, but was fired 
from Newsweek "because I wouldn't 
report the body count. they wanted" 
and quit CBS to go into Vietnam to see 
what was happening there. 

"I was finding it more and more diffi· 
cult to get out the truth a. a journalist. I 
think that was born out by what later 
happened. Most journalists ju.t accepted 
the Pentagon's story of the war ... 

"The television journalists told the 
truth in spite of themselves. They had 
to report something, and there were 
villages being de.troyed by the US 
right in front of them. 

:'50 they helped end the war, but it 
was almost against their will . They had 
no choice," J.hnson believes. 

Johnson blame. uncritical journa. 
Iism on American "firehouse" reporting. 

"Firehouse." are bureau •• taffed by 
a new. outlet. When there i. a story 
IOmeplace, reporters, baaed in a major 
regional center, ru.h to the scene of the 

sto~often in an unfamiliar .. etting. 
"The fint place they go is the Amerl· 

can embassy. There, they get told what 
the 'informed sources' think about the 
story, and if they're lucky, they may 
even get a CIA agent to talk to. 
They're unfamiliar with the place, so 
they don't have anyplace else to go. 

"If a reporter starts straying too 
much, they don't get tho.e briefings, 
and that cuts them off from their 
• ource •. 

"In Vietnam, for example, they 
couldn't ride in helicopters if the mili. 
tary didn't like what they were writing." 

Even journalists like Michael Herr, 
whose Dis"atches was a grim account 
of what the war meant to the ~oIdiers, 
wasn't critical of policy, Johnson main· 
huns. 

"Herr was closer to the Gis than 
anyone, but I just don't think he was 
hone.t. He was there when GI opposi. 
tion to the war was at its highest. But he 
didn't report that. They were fragging 
officer. in the army and air force in '64 
and '65. 

"He's got a line in his book where 
someone asks him what his point of 

. view was on Vietnam. He says, 'Well 
I was there, that'. my point of view.' 
That'. a way of avoiding a po.ition. 
General Giapwu there. General WettrocJre. 
land was there. Ho Chi Minh wu there, 

and they had positions." 
But, Johnson says about his decision 

to leave journalism and enter politics, 
"I'm still torn about it; I kind of wished 
I'd covered it. Every journalist wants to 
be where the aciton is." 

He .till relies on his reporting skills as 
a leftist politician, as his views of Nica· 
ragua, which he recently visited, demon· 
strate . 

"The schools of medicine and agri. 
culture are open, because they consider 
those vital to the nation. Everyone el.e 
is working on a five·month literacy 
campaign. Before the revolution, 885,000 
of two million people were illiterate. 
The government tolerates dissent and 
all forms of expression. While I was 
there, I saw anti·government demon· 
strations from workers demanding imme-
diat«: pay increases. The government 
thinks it is better to increase social ser· 
vices, which increase real wages. But 
Sandinistas allow the expression, and 
they are gaining ground in the trade 
union elections.

'The French .ued for peace,

regime under Diem wal 
eltablished in the South; later, 
Diem, having outlived his

by the CIA. Still later General 
Khan was removed at US 
orders delivered by Maxwell . 
Taylor, and Thieu, the last of 
the puppets of the "Republic" 
of Vietnam, was elected 
.ily,. since he was the only 
candidate on the ballot. 

Mr. Bui's call for future 
historians and "scholarly" 
documentaries to unravel the 
enigma of Vietnam seems 
singularly dilingenuous when 
one considers the facts he 
careJessly (carefully?) omits. 

"Why should only the joint 
US-South Vietnam effort be 
condemned?" Mr. Bui 
continues. Again, one can 
only marvel at the durability of 
certain myths. The liberation 
of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) 
by NLF and North Viet-
namese forces with scarcely a 
shot being fired disenthralled 
the die-hards of whatever 
illusions they may have 
nurtured about a joint effort. 
When the US pulled out, the 
war was over. Period. The 
question is not how 
Vietnamese freedom fighters 
can jUltify killing their 
~ppressors, but rather how the 
US can justify denying the will 
01 80 percent of a population 
by waging the most extenlive 
bombing campaign in human 
hiltory and Uling napalm, 
CBUs and mass assassination 
(CIA'. Operation PhOenix) to 
crush the popular will. 

Do supporters 01 Pol Pot 
have the right to resist 
Vietnameae aggression? Not 
only would one think they 
have the right, but also that 
they would be actively 
exercising it. Unfortunately, 
the terror unleashed by Pol Pot 

.against the Cambodian people 
does not seem to have won 
him widespread support. And 
whatever criticism. one would 
make of the Vietnamese 
action, it must be remember· 
ed, al observers like William 
Shawcross have pointed out, 
that it was the Nixon/ Killin-
ger policy-overthrowing 
Sihanouk, ".ecret" bombing 
and finally overt invasion-
which led to the pre.ent 
instability in Cambodia. 

It i. curioUl, though not 
very IUrprising CONIidering 
Mr. Bui'l selective memory, 
that nowhere il the CUneae

nuclear w. foHow Soviet 
intervention in Aftheniatan, 
and viii.. to 8eiiinI by US 

Secretary 01' War Harold . 
Brown follow the Chinese 
inv8lion of Vietnam. 

Mr. Bui is correct on one 
point, however. Hearts and 
Minds il one-.ided. It 
concentrates on the US role in 
Vietnam. As director Peter 
Davis put it: "Why we went to 
Vietnam, what we did there-
what the doing has done in 
turn to America." How the 
American people could be 
mobilized to fight a war of 
counterrevolution is indeed a 
troubling question for any 
American, particularly in this 
period where the din of war 
drums grows louder. Davis 
brilliantly exposes a host of 
American myths-tile 
international communist 
conspiracy, 6fe (iIDd war) as a 
game where being number one 
is all . that counts-some of 
which are being dusted of( now 
for the OlyrRpic boycott, the 
draft and who knows what 
other use. 

Films are being made here 
and in the Philippines that 
justify all American excesaes 
in tenns of the enemy's 
brutality (the roulette scenes in 
Deer Hunter and the 
vaccination reprisal in 
Apocalypse No·w). Both films 
merely dramatize the basic 
racist ideology 10 succinctly 
expressed by General of the 
Army William Wesbnoreland 
in Hearts and Minds: "1\e 
Oriental doeln't place the 
same high value on life that we 
do." Significantly both films 
ignore the political roots of the 
war. 

It is essential that we not 
seek to forget or disregard 
what might explain it. The 
United States engaged in 
aupporting counterrevolution, 
and later waged it overtly, 
because it disapproved of the 
Vietnamese people's choice of 
leaders. During that time our 
own leaders waged a 
campaign of lies and deception 
that . dragged our society 
deeper and deeper into the 
tragedy. 

We would all do well to see 
films like Hearts and Minds tq 
remind us of the misery and 
luffering that resulted from 
alowing ourselve. to be 10 
deceived_ And we would do 
well 10 view the platitudes and 
warmongering emerging daily

Anti-Soviet Protests 
Paralyze Afghans 

KABUL, Afghanistan - The Soviet-backed goverriment 
appeared to have virtually broken down yesterday in the face of 
Itrikes and violence protesting the RUllian preaence in 
Afghanistan. MedicallOurces said more than 300 civilians died 
in street fighting. 

Striking civil servants and office workers ignored repeated 
official broadcasts ordering them to return to work and Afghan 
government miniltries were paralyzed for a third day. A general 
strike of shopkeepers continued into its fifth day. 

Heavily anned Soviet and Afghan troops, backed by 
submachine gun-toting civilian members of the ruling Khalq 

P~le's Party, maintained patrols throughout the city. 
There were indications the Soviet military commander in 

Kabul was, in effect, acting as head of the government. . 

Reports indicated fighting that raged in Kabul on Friday had 
slowed considerably. One report reaching New Delhi said 
gunfire rattled through the streets oj Kabul through Sunday 
night, but a Frenchman in Kabul told a Paris radio station during 
a telephone interview that the center of the ci?' was calm. 

Tall, the official Soviet newl agency, said 'life in Kabul is 
now P.'~ually coming back to no~a1," and claimed an "armed 
aortie of agenti trained ~ the .pecial aervice. of Weltem

Bani-Sadr Joins 
'Mobilization' 

TEHRAN - Thousands 
of Iranians paraded through 
rain and snow pa.t the 
occupied US Embassy in 
Tehran yesterday and 
President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr told them from atop the 
embassy compound wall they 
must stay united in the face of 
potential foreign threats. 

Machine gun-armed 
Moalem militants marched 
back and forth in the courtyard 
of the embassy, where 
approximately 50 American 
hostages spenuheir 114thday 
in captivity. 

Bani-Sadr's appearance, 
part of Iran's "Mobilization 
Week" ceremonies, was his 
first at the emballY since he 
was elected president Jan. 25. 

In an interview published 
earlier yesterday, he praised 
the militants who have held the 
embassy and hOltages since 
Nov. ~ as "young patriots." 
And he made no mention of 
the release of the hostages in 
either the interview or speech. 

But he did tell the 

interviewer for the Hong Kong 
Star newspaper that the 
militanll "mUit respect the 
lawful authorities."

when he proclaimed: "I will not

Aid to Depend · on Academic progress 
BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 

SKramento CorrelpOndent 
A recommendation that students 

who receive state financial aid show 
satisfactory academic progress in 
order to maintain eligibility for their Cal 
Grants was adopted by a state finance 
sub· committee yesterday. 

"Students must make satisfactory 
academic progress to remain eligible 
for assistance under federal student 
financial aid programs," legislative 
analyst Bill Chavez told the committee, 
"but there are no such formal 
requirements for rec ipients of 
California student aid." 

For a California financial aid award 
to be renewed, a student must prove he 
is eligible for continued enrollment, 
according to Chavez. 

Such a system lends itself to abuse, 
Chavez said. 

"A student can be ineligible for 
federal student aid because he or she is 
not making satisfactory academic 
progress, but continues to receive state 

aid," the analyst pointed out. 
This will not infringe on the 

university's autonomy, Chavez 
maintained, because the US Office of 
Education allows each post.secondary 
institution of education to set its own 
policy. 

At the University of California, 
. student recipients of BEOG (federal 

grant) must be in good standing and 
have satisfactorily completed a certain 
number of units within a specific time 
period. 

Good academic standing at the 
University is a 2.2 CPA, according to 
Marilyn Jaeger, a systemwide financial 
aid official. 

To receive a 100 percent grant , UC 
students must complete 12 units per 
quarter, completing nine units entitles a 
student to a 75 percent grant, and six 
units for a half grant. 

Jaeger also said the university is 
working on a systemwide policy that 
wiU establish financial aid eligibility in 
specific detail, although she did not 

know when it would be completed. 
In another action, the Senate 

sutx:ommittee approved the Student 
Aid Commission's 1980-81 $83 
million budget after deleting $100,800 
of state funds which paid for employee 
parking. 

Significantly , the Student Aid 

Commission Jarvis II budget was not 
disculled. According to Capitol 
sources, several legi.lators are 
lobbying Gov. Brown to scratch his 
original idea of presenting alongside his 
1980-81 budget a contingency 
financial plan showing proposed cuts 
should Jarvis II pass. 

Drop Date Move to Week 4, 
'W' Grade Go Before Senate 

The Academic Senate will consider 
a proposal today to cut the drop date 
/rom the sixth week to the fourth, but 
make it possible for students to stop a 
class until the ninth week if they are 
willing to have that noted on their 
transcript. 

The proposal has been on the 
agenda since the last Senate meeting ,in 
January, when a speech by UC 
President David Saxon look the 
a"ention of the body. 

Put forth by Professor Tom Bond, 

the proposal would add a "W" to the 
transcript of students who drop a d ... 
between the fourth and ninth weeks. 

While this obviously would not be a 
favorable mark on a transcript, Bond 
has argued that it is not a penalty 
either, simply a device to encourage 
students to drop claslel earlier. 

Bond claims that administrative 
problems involved with student. 
keeping c1ll1les longer than neceuary, 
especially in lab classes, have apar!ced 
the move for a change.

that much of the trouble has 
been caused by unrealistic 
planning on their own part and 
poor implementation of the

Communist Party's central 
committee-is a sweeping set 
of "new ' economic plant" 
which emphasize flexibility , 
greater local autonomy and a 
revival of the private sector. 

buffalo, cattle, pig. and 
chickens very well," the party 
daily Nhan Dan said in an Oct. 

. 13 editorial, "It is dogmatic, 
' and it's bad economics, to 
carry out policies and 
measures which prevent farm 
families from raising their own 
animals ." 

Plans to complete the 

Tuelilay, Februuy 26, 1980 

coUectivization of agriculture 
by the end of this year have 
been dropped. New regula-
tions allow families to cultivate 
unused land at the <;oopera-
lives and use the harvest as 
they wish. Tax breaks are 
given to organizations or 
families who open up new 
farming land. 

Thit is especially true for 
agricultural cooperative. in 
the South, which has been 

resented and resisted by 
farmers in the fertile Mekong 
Delta. On the industrial side, 
would-be investor. have too 
often been frustrated by 
government red tape and 
su~cion. 

The response-worked out 
at a July, 1979, meeting of the 

"When state farms and 
cooperatives haven't yet

told me. You can't even say that in 
parts of San Diego or Los Angeles. 

The country's healthier, too, a condi-
tion he attributes to Cuban doctors. 

"There are 700 Cuban doctors in the 
country. At one hoapital, where there 
were 20 people being helped every day 
before the revolution, there are now 
1,500. What does the US do? I am 
even emberraued about what the Soviet 
Union has done. Their contribution is 
1,000 toni of rice and a few penciJs and 

'1 

papers for the literacy campaign. Even 
the aid committee in Miami contributed 
3,000 tons." 

Johnson's journalistic eye is tem-
pered by the ardor he has for what the 
Sandinistas have done, and what he 
hopes can be done in this country. 

"They are making a nation in Nica-
ragua. This is the stuff dreams are 
made of, stuff people will die for. The 
revolution will be made in this country, 
by )'oung people, and they'll be just as 
enthu.~iastic. it'D pin your ears back." 

, 

"Then he went on to the 
effect that American 
correspondents had a patriotic 
duty to disseminate only 
information that made the 
United States look good. 

"A network television 
correspondent said, 'Surely, 
Arthur, you don't expect the 
American press to be 
handmaidens of the govem-
ment.'
