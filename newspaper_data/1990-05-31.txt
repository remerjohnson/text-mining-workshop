By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

School officials said this week 
that no changes in campus pool 
security procedures are planned in 
the aftennath of Fifth College first-
year tudent Rachel Robison 's 
drowning at the clo ed Canyon-

Campus pol ice plan to meet with 
the Sports Facilities Department 
and the Campus Recreation De-
partment "to see if there 's any-
thing to do to enhance the ecurity 
of the [Canyon view] area," UCSD 
Police Chief John Ander on said. 

However, Anderson expressed 
doubt that any changes in ecurity 
policy will be made becau e little 
can be done to prevent people from 
entering the pool area. 

"I don ' t think there 's a panacea. 

Anderson added that the police 
department has no plan to tep up 
patrols near Canyonview. 

Director of Spans Facilities 
Vanessa Cunningham said student 
often use hot tubs at Canyon view 
and the Main Gym's Natatorium 
during the night. 

"We find evidence of one kind 
or another that someone has a party 
[at the Natatoriumjacuzzi] several 
times a week," Cunningham said. 

But like Anderson, Cunning-
ham felt that little can be done to 
prevent nighttime excursions by 
students into c:.lmpus pools. 

"What we already do seems to 
erve uS well, and would not have 

prevented the drowning .... We do 
take the highest po ible security 
procedures we can," Cunningham

Robison' blood alcohol level to 
be .03 percent, well below .08, the 
intoxication level at which it is 
illegal to drive in California. 

A spoke man for the coroner's 
office wa unable to confirm or 
deny that report. 

Friends aid Robison had been 
drinking at a barbeque Friday 
evening, but was not drunk at the 
pool. 

Robison, 18, died at 4 a.m. 
Saturday in Scripp Memorial Ho -
pita!. She drowned after apparently 
becoming trapped under tarps cov-
ering the pool.

scribed by her friends as a strong 
athlete, had visited the closed pool 
at about I :30 a.m. Saturday with a 
group of friends who entered the 
pool area through an unlocked back

Council Approves Budgets, Appoints RIMAe Rep. 
By MARY BETTY HEARD 
Senior Staff Writer 

In light of the recent tensions between 
the co-ops and the UCSD administration, 
the A.S. Council allocated $1,200 last eve-
ning from its media unallocated fund to We 
the People, a campus publication. 

The money allocated will cover the cost 
of printing "A Student Democracy Move-
ment Clo e to Home Needs Your Help," a 
student publi 'ation on intervention by uni-
versity admini trations. 

"The booklet deal with the history of the 
admini trative intervention in tudent ac-
tivitie and it would be appropriate now 
because of what ' going on with the co-op 
... it has a history of not only what ha hap-
pened here but also at other UC campu e ," 
Communications Commi ioner Gloria 
Corral said. 

According t Vice Pre ident of Finance 

Sergio Langarica, the Finance Board sup-
ported the allocation because "we felt it was 
really important with the whole UCB and 
co-op problem. They want to circulate [the 
booklet] around here and to other UCs .. ," 

The A.S. also passed three budgets last 
night: the alternative media budget, the stu-
dent organization budget and the student 
organizations cultural programming budget. 

The alternative media budget encom-
passes all on-campus media publication , 
with the exception of the Guardian. The 
only question asked about the budget con-
cerned a $375 allocation to the Koala for a 
computer.

San Diego Police Take 
Clairemont Murder 
Suspect Into Custody 

UCSD, SDSU Students Stabbed Earlier This Year 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

A 31-year-old man was taken into 
custody yesterday for questioning con-
cerning the stabbing deaths of three 
Clairemont women, including a UCSD 
student, earlier this year. 

The man was identified by San Di-
ego Police as Luis A. Lebron, a truck 
driver residing in the 4400 block of 
Pacific Highway in San Diego. 

Lebron, a black male, was taken into 
custody outside his residence at ap:-
proximately 4 p.m. yesterday by the 
San Diego Police Department's Homi-
cide Department and Criminal Intelli-
gence Unit, Sergeant Chuck Peck said. 

Homicide Department and Robbery 
Department detectives served a search 
warrant on Lebron's residence yester-
day even ina, Peck said. 

As of press time, infonnation on 
how detectives located Lebron was not 
released, and police would not say if 
fonnal charges will be pre sed against 
him. 

The first in the series of Clairemont 
murders occurred on Jan. 12, when 20-
year-old San Diego State tudent Tif-
fany Schultz wa found fatally stabbed 

in her apartment in the 3100 block of 
Cowley Way. According to a coroner's 
report, Schultz had been stabbed more 
than 50 tir.les. 

In the second incident, Janene Wein-
hold, 21, a Warren College senior, was 
slain in her apartment in the 3300 block 
of Clairemont Drive on Feb. 16. 

And on April 3, Holly Tarr, a high 
school senior visiting from her home in 
Michigan, was stabbed to death in her 
brother's apartment in the 3400 block 
of Cowley Way. 

AfterTarr'smurder,policeconcrded 
that the murders could be the work of a 
serial killer, because there were "un-
mistakable similarities" between the 
three stabbings. 

Police said the similarities included 
the age, sex, and race of the victims, the 
time the murders occurred (the after-
noon), and the proximity of the crimes. 

The crimes also all occurred in up-
stairs apartments that showed no ign of 
forced entry. 

Several witne se saw a black male 
run from the site of Tarr's murder. 
Composite drawing of the u pect, 
described as being in his lale teen, 5'8" 
tall, and of medium build, were circu-
lated as part of an inten ive manhunt.

Students Criticize Business Dept. 
Curriculum, Scheduling, Recruiting 

RIVERSIDE - Only months after students in the 
Graduate School of Management at UC Riverside ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with their program, undergradu-
ates in the Business Administration/Administrative Stud-
ies Department are voicing similar complaints. 

Adolfo Saldana, a senior majoring in Business Ad-
ministration, has circulated a petition which addresses 
three major problems with the undergraduate business de-
partment. The petition is to be submined directly to Chan-
cellor Rosemary S.J. Schraer. 

According to Saldana, the petition reflects the majority 
opinion of the students he has come in contact with and 
recurring complaints he ha heard about the program. 
Specifically, the petition criticizes the curriculum, course 
scheduling, and corporate recruiting. 

The petition states that the "variety of elective classes 
is very limited," leaving the quality of education inferior 
to that of comparable schools. It also expresses concern 
over "severe flaws" in the scheduling of required and 
elective course. 

According to Saldana, elective course are only of-
fered one quarter per year, and professors only want to 
teach classes of 45 or 50 students. Problems arise when 
100 students or more enroll in tho e courses. 

In addition, UCR does not employ professors to teach 
many of the classes and must bring in visiting professors 
from Cal Poly Pomona or Cal State San Bernardino, 
usually on an over-enrollment basis. 

The main problem in course curriculum is attributed to 
the lack of diversity in elective courses , and the emphasis 
on core discipline. Students feel that marketing, advertis-
ing. and international relations are neglected. 

Saldana also criticized UCR's efforts in corporate 
recruiting. The petition calls the scope of the recruitment 
program "extremely narrow." 

Evelyn Petrie, assistant to the chairman of the Business 
Department, said she was unaware of the petition effort 
and therefore could not comment on it. 

As of Fall 1989, there were I ,260 students registered as 
Pre-business, Administrative Studies, or Business Ad-
mini tration majors, making up 15 percent of the campus 
population.

UCSB Officials Investigates Alleged 
Assault of Student by Math TA 

SANTA BARBARA- University officials are inves-
tigating an April incident in which a UCSB undergraduate 
was allegedly assaulted by a university Math Department 
teaching assistant in the San Rafael Residence Hall. 

Jacob Neal Sarvela was arrested and is awaiting ar-
raignmenr on charges. He allegedly attacked Tom Tieu in 
the fi"rst floor San Rafael television lounge on April 7. 
Both were residing in San Rafael at the time. 

According to police records, two officers responded to 
a report of a fight in the San Rafael lounge at approxi-
mately 9:10 p.m. where they discovered Tieu sitting on a 
couch with "multiple lacerations on his face and a consid-
erable amounr of blood on his sweatshirt and jeans." 

In a statemenr to the police, Tieu said he was con-
fronted by Sarvela while sitting in the TV room watching 
"horror movies" with a fflend. Upon entering the room, 
Sarvela reportedly instigated a confronration with Tieu 
over what channel they would watch. Following a verbal 
exchange, Sarvela allegedly placed Tieu in a headlock 
and began to hit him several times in the face with his 
closed fist. 

According to a doctor's tatement included in the 
police report, Tieu sustained multiple lacerations and 
contusions to the face-one of which required stitches -
swelling around his left eye and a broken nose. Sarvela 
had a small scrape on the side of his nose and several 
abrasions on his knuckles and fingers. 

Though Tieu did not wish to press charges immedi-
ately after the incidenr he declared on April 10 that he 
would proceed with charges of felony battery with serious 
injuries. Report of the incident was not made public until 
recently when Tieu sought the assistance of the UCSB 
Asian Studenr Coalition.

UC Regents Approve $5 Million 
Donation to UCSD Cancer Center 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

In its May meeting, the University ofCalifomia's 
Board of Regents approved Ben and Sheri Kelt ' 
contribution of $5 million to the UCSD Cancer Cen-
ter. 

The center, one of 40 federally supported clinical 
and research centers in the country, provides conven-
tional and experimental treatments for all forms of 
malignancy. 

According to the UCSD Communications Office, 
approximately 150 phYSicians and cientists from the 
UCSD faculty are affiliated with the cancer center. 

Jean Gorman, the Director of Planned Giving at 
UCSD, explained that the Kelts' $5 mill ion gift will 
establish a "charitable remainder" trust fund . The 

money is a planned gift to be received by the cancer 
center at a later time. 

"This is the largest trust fund ever et up [at 
UCSD1," Gorman commented. 

In a prepared statement on behalf of himself and 
his wife, Ben Kelts said, "[We] , are pleased to be a 
part of the important work taking place at the UCSD 
Cancer Center, and we hope our support will help ex-
pand this vital resource and contribute to the fight 
against the scourge of cancer." 

Sheri Kelts graduated from UCSD in the early 
1970s with a degree from the Department of Anthro-
pology, where-she worked as a research assistant after 
her graduation. 

Ben Kelts, who is a venture capitalist specializing 
in the field of high-technology, isalso a member of the

Social Security 

A Time for Honesty 
It isn't surprising to find dishonesty in Washington. It is, after 

all, the center of the largest and most complex governmental 
system in the world. Billions of dollars are at stake, and if poli-
ticians can mislead the American public about the size of the 
budget deficit, they certainly will. So the attempts by members of 
both parties to crush Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's pro-
posal to put Social Security on an honest footing shouldn' t shock 
anyone. 

Except for one thing. It is surprising when members of a 
political party fail to seize on a proposal that would pay them 
large dividends in popularity. In fact, it is downright startling for 
a party to pass up such an opportunity - unless we're talking 
about the Democratic party. 

And we are. Moynihan's proposal has the potential to be a 
political gold mine. It would return Social Security to its original 
concept: a pay-as-you-go trust fund . It would also slash the Social 
Security taxes, which take up to $1,200 out of a family's take 
home pay. If the Democrats had any serious intention of recap-
turing the White House any time soon, they would, to quote 
pundit Jonathan Sal ant, "seize upon the tax issue the way a person 
in the desert would seize a glass of water." 

Here is a chance for the Democrats - known to most Ameri-
cans (not completely unfairly) as the "tax and spend party" - to 
cut taxes. Not taxes for the rich, in the manner of Bush's capital 
gains tax cut. On the contrary, Social Security taxes are shame-
fully regressive. When junk bond king Michael Milken took 
home $550 million one year, he paid the same to Social Security 
as someone whose income was 10,000 times less. The poor, on 
average, start work at a younger age than the wealthy, retire when 
they're older, and have a lower life expectancy - so they pay in 
to Social Security longer, and don ' t collect for as long. 

So why are the Democrats fumbling the ball? That's a question 
that has been asked many times, about many things, for the last 
two decades. Moynihan quotes Michael Oreskes, writing in the 
New York Times , "once perceived as the party of compassion and 
progress, Democrats are now considered by many Americans as 
a fragmented bunch whose policies are likely to produce (if they 
produce anything at all) too much spending on the poor and to(l 
many burdens on the working people." 

In this case, the sticking point is that Democrats (and Repub-
licans) can't bear to give up the surplus the Social Security 
system is earning. The budget deficit, according to White House 
Budget Director Richard Darman, will be about $165 billion. But 
the real figure could be nearly double this, when the cost of the 
S&L bailout is figured in, and the Social Security surplus is taken 
out. The Congress and the White House can't bear the thought of 
the real budget deficit becoming public in an election year. 

Some opponents of Moynihan 's proposal argue that with this 
huge deficit, it would be irresponsible to cut taxes. But it is also 
irresponsible to try to balance the budget on the backs of America's 
working poor. We cannot continue to tax employment and 
subsidize unemployment. Ths Social Security surplus, which is 
currently around $38 billion and is projected to be many times 
that in a decade or so, is not a plaything for congressmen. People 
do not pay into Social Security so Congress can have its pork; 
they pay in expectation of being taken care of in their old age. 

It's time Congress started dealing honestly with the issue of 
Social Security. It is also long past time for Congress to cut the 
deficit by c utting wasteful spending, not by applying smoke and 
mirrors to the numbers. In the last 15 years, the average real wage 
of American families has hardly increased. Congress has a 
chance to change that, and Democrats have a chance to make 
Republicans look bad . It would be madness to not act on 
Moynihan ' s proposal. 

But then, madness seems to be a congressional specialty. 

Keeping the Hopes of Tiananmen Alive 
Editor: 
On June 4, 1989, the People's 

Liberation Army massacred the 
Chinese people mercilessly in 
Beijing. This has shocked the 
whole world and detoured China's 
path of development. 

Overthe past year, the political 
situations allover the world, like 
those in Latin America, South 
Africa, and particularly in Eastern 
Europe, have been changing radi-
cally. So what is the present situ-
ation in China? 

Diplomatically, the relations 
between China and the West are 
uptight. The stubbornness of China 
has brought about boycotts of 
different sorts. The glasnost of the 
Soviet Union infuriated the Chi-
nese leadership. They consider 
them deviating from "Socialism." 
The difference in ideology be-
comes an important obstacle for 
improving their relations, and this 
makes China even more isolated. 

Economically, China contin-
ues its contractional policies. Al-
though these policies managed to 
control the inflation, they brought 
along other problems such as 
unemployment and increases in 
corporate debts. 

To stabilize the unrest of the 
people, prices are heavily subsi-
dized. This, together with the in-
crease in military expenditure, 
have brought about a substantial 
increase in the budget deficit. In 
the coming years, the maturing of 
most external debts will further 
worsen the economic problems of 
this isolated country. Other prob-
lems, such as corruption and privi-
leged class, which are of no less 
serious importance, will all lower 
the living standard of Chinese 
people. A government without (he 
support of people will not be able 
to sustain. 

The Chinese government has 
increased its censorship in speech, 
press and literature. The govern-
ment forces the people to study 
the speeches of the Chinese lead-
ers. The slogans. propaganda, and 
political campaigns during the 

BENSON 

Cultural Revolution reappear. The 
dictators required absolute obedi-
ence from the people, and those 
who disagree with them will be 
purged. Many intellectuals and 
workers who participated in the 
democratic movement last year 
would be imprisoned permanently. 
For some others, their imprison-
ment and harassment were not 
even announced. Although the 
Beijing government has already 
lifted the Manial Law, soldiers 
continue to patrol the people care-
fully. All these measures have 
infuriated the already angry yet 
silent crowd. 

A lot of people who panici-

pated in the pro-democratiC move-
ment last year are still under im-
prisonment. The Chinese govern-
ment has not relaxed its control of 
the people. At this time of the year 
we remember the persecuted ones. 
We should continue to press the 
Chinese government so thatChina 
will become a more democratic 
country. 

We sincerely thank everybody 
who has been concerned about the 
liberty of Chinese people. We hope 
that all of us will keep this concern 
and fight the battle towards de-
mocracy together.

Study Group 

Article Was Misleading 
Editor: 

1 read with interest the feature about California's drought and 
the affect it has on UCSD ("High and Dry," May 21). While the 
story was good (albeit long) it left quite a few questions for the 
reader and the photographs used were extremely misleading. 

One pbotograph showed the Revelle fountain with a caption 
that read: "The Revelle fountain uses recycled water. According 
to a UCSD water management program (starting June I) no foun-
tains can be used unless the water is recycled." 

The second photograph showed. the Price Center fountain with 
the caption: "UCSD will attempt to reduce its water usage by 10 
percent, even if water conservation in San Diego remains purely 
voluntary." 

Afterreading the article and accompanying photographs, one 
is led to believe tbat the Price Center fountain is not being used 
because the water is not recycled. Yet nothing could be further 
from the uuth. The photograph of the Price Center fountain was 
obviously taken during its recent painting. Yet we are led to 
believe that the fountain is not being used due to water manage-
ment concems and the water shortage. I confirmed suspicions by 
calling Physical Plant and requesting information about water re-
cycling procedures - specifically for the Price Center fountain. 
Indeed, my assumption is correct. 

Besides receiving a salary for their journalistic expertise, the 
Guardian is an educational tool for your staff. Good journalism 
should be reinforced; otherwise the paper is viewed as nothing 
short of "yellow journalism." If the Guardian not only professes 
to get the wotd out, buteducate$ its staff members, then I feel they 
should meet the same high standards as set for journalists in the 
"outside" work force and be held accountable for their work. 

I wonder how many people were led to believe that the photo-
graph of the Price Center fountain indicated that it is not up to code 
and its use is being restricted due to the California drought!

Experts met to discus their views on 
how America can adapt scientific and 
technological research to the changing 
post-Cold War world at a Third College 
convocation last Wednesday evening. 

The panel included William Graham, 
who served as chief science adviser in 
the Reagan Administration; John 
Warner, executive vice president of Sci-
ence Applications International Corpo-
ration; James Arnold of the UCSD Chem-
istry Department; and Lawrence Krau e 
of the UCSD In titute for International 
Relations/pacific Studies. 

The panelists, pecializing in a vari-

the re ulting pressure to reduce defense 
spending in the United States. 

Acting Third College Dean Gordon 
Schlesinger moderated the discussion :L-Id 
outlined the sets of problems that were 
addressed during the forum. 

According to Schlesinger, also a 
chemistry professor at UCSD, the press-
ing dilemmas that the U.S. now faces 
include a negative trade balance which 
stems from increasingly weU-organized 
technological competition from Japan. 
the European Economic Community, and 
from Eastern Bloc countries. and also 
how scientific research should be redi-
rected now that the nature of the defense 
establishment has changed. 

Graham, who served as the deputy 
administrator of NASA for a year in 
addition to his role as Reagan's science 
adviser, pointed out the importance of 
government research funding to the uni-

versities. 
"Many of the research projects at this 

campu and others are sponsored by 
offices of the government," he said. 

Graham cited stati tics he said sug-
gest that Defense Department cuts would 
not cripple the basic Atnerican science 
establishment. 

"In 1991, the proposal for basic re-
search has gone up to approximately $12 
billion- anincreaseofabout$l billion, 
or eight percent over the 1990 budget," 
Graham continued. 

According to Graham, only about $1 
billion of this would come from the 
Defense Depamnent. As a result, re-
search and development stands to lose, 
at most, eight percent of its funding. 

He noted that the average American 
is not as sensitive to military spending 
now as oppdsed to 1950.

Continued from page 6 

Wamer said that it is necessary 
for the U.S. to " learn to adaptto the 
global economic environment that 
we· face" in view of imminent de-
fense budget cuts. 

According to Warner, the U.S. 
needs to realize that other nations 
look at economic relations in dif-
ferent ways, and suggested that the 
U.S. could learn by studying alter-
native philosophies. 

A.S. 
Continued from page 1 
it's about the price ofa typewriter. 
The rest of the money [needed to 
buy a computer] will come from 
[the Koala] ," Third Senior Senator 
Victoria Williams said. 

The student organ.ization budget 
and the student organization cul-
tural programming budget. which 
encompass on-campus clubs and 
support groups, each for $10,000, 
were also passed with little discus-
s.ion. 

The A.S. Council made one 
appointment last evening, assign-
ing Leon Meschoulam the position 
of A.S. Representative to the RI-
MAC Committee. 

"Meschoulam has been very 
active ... very involved ... very 
enthusiastic." said Nick Long, 
University Center Board Chair. 
"When he was not appointed to the 
committee by Fifth College, he 
continued to attend meetings and 
was more knowlegeable than the 
appointee." 

The A.S. postponed the request 
for $600 from the media unallo-
cated fund for the purchase of a 
grill to be lent out to student or-
ganizations for fund raising events. 

The bill was proposed by Vice 
President External MoUy McKay 
in response to a recent change in 
policy by most colleges on the 
lending of college-owned griUs. 

"They're not going to let any-
one borrow their grills unless their 
organization is directly related to 
the college or Residential Life of-
fiee," said McKay. 

Concerned with the possibility 
that the grill would be stored at the 
A.S. offices, advisor Randy Woo-
dard said, "My staff is all women. 
I'm not going to have them lug this 
thing out." 

The bill was postponed due to 
lack of information on where the 
grill would be stored, hOw much it 
would cost, and on whom the re-
sponsibility of upkeep would fall. 

Said UCB Chair Nick Long, "If 
the A.S. buys this, and the A.S. has 
to clean it, you can count me out." 

Warner also said that a harmful 
adversarial relationship between 
industry and the government ex-
ists, and that something needs to be 
done to encourage a closer rela-
tionship between the two. 

Krause's discussion focused on 
thePacific Basin, emphasizing that 
since it is the fastest-growing re-
gion in the world, the U.S. will 
have to begin competing economi-
call y there. 

"Increasingly it is the science 
and engineering, and our technol-
ogy, that is what's carrying U.S. 
competitiveness [in the Pacific 

Basin]," Krause said. 
Arnold took an optimistic view-

point, and cited the s trength in 
scientific research of American 
universities as evidence that the 
U.S. "has done some very impor-
tant things righl .. 

Arnold also pointed out that the 
successful small companies started 
by the graduates of U.S. universi-
ties, such as Applet:omputer, "are 
creating the new jobs, the new 
products, and the will to exert and 
to excel, which seems to be tbe 
brightest hope of the U.S. in the 
long run."

also allows for the exploitation of 
gold, silver, or minerals, and for 
the establishment of agricultural 
settlements, ranches, and mills . 

"The U.S. government has taken

Continued from page 1 

Greatest Hits, which is a Rhino 
[Records] compilation which Ilike. 
The new World Party. There's 
always orne Sly and the Family 
Stone. Peter Case is always on 
there omewhere ... all different 
thingsdependingon what I'm into 
at the moment. 

Do you feelalienared from the pop 
scene? 

[ don't think about it. I just do 
my own thing. But I also don't 
begrudge them their success. 
Whoever it is [that is at the top of 
the charts] worked really hard to 
be successful. I mean, there's no 

doubt that Depeche Mode have a 
lot going for them. I just don't like 
their music, but they're not a bad 
band. They produce really nice 
tunes. They obviously work h ard 
and believe that they'll do some-
thing, so I've got respect for them. 
But I don'! want to make music 
like that. 

Speaking of Depeche Mode , you 
have an interesting choice of songs 
you cover live. When you performed 
at UCSD last March , you ended che 
set wich a mesh between Madonna's 
"Ukea Prayer" and Depeche Mode's 
"Personal Jesus." Is chat something 
you will do sporadically? 

Very much so. [ remember that 
how. [ didn't enjoy it. I had to 

stand onstage for twO minutes at 
the beginning. There weren't any 

monitors. [ got a lot of fan letters 
from that gig, oddly enough. Af-
terwards, I went to go see Aeros-
mith at some big, horrible stadium. 

Did you like them live? 
No, they were as boring as shit. 

But I do do a cover of "What It 
Takes"now. 

Completely off che subject , what 
do you chink about the Bn tish poll 
wx! 

Disgusting. [Margare t 
Thatcher] is a mad, stupid bitch. 

Don't hold back, Wes. Tell us 
how you really feel. That's funny, 
because Tears For Fears recencly ex-
pressed similar response about the 
situation. 

She is. Tears For Fears are a pile 
of shit , but she is a mad, stupid 
bitch . 

Will this kill her chances for a 
reelection ofparty leadership chis year? 

Undoubtedly. There's been a 
lot of r iots. I think they're ta lking 
about well over a mill ion or two 
million people aren't going to 
bother to pay the poll tax, me 
included. What are they going to 
do, put two million people in jail? 
It's a stupid tax, because it's a tax 
on poor people, is what it is . The 
rate system which we had, which is 
very fair, [made] you pay a little 
more tax if you had a much bigger 
house and more land. So basically, 
the richer you were, you paid a bit 
more. And it's not tons more .. . 
And now, there can be this one 
man that lives in a gigantic man-
sion and five incredibly poor people 
[whose children], because they 

don't have any money, can't move 
out of [thehousc]. The five people 
are going to pay five times as much 

. as the one man. 
It 's going to be the downfall of 

her government, without any 
question, because now she's 20% 
behind in the polls. It wouldn't 
surprise me if she doesn't last until 
the e lection. I think this year will 
be the first year she'll get chal-
lenged for the leadership. 

Speaking of institutions, do you 
think rock music is one? 

It is, without a doubt. 
~tnuzkes it so? 
It just is, isn't it? Howcould you 

argue that it wasn't ?That's stupid. 
It's like is Bob Dylan a poet or is he 
not a poet? [Laughs] Of course he's 
a fucking poet.

FILM 
Continued from page 10 
government defends its " invasion" 
by Sl ating that the Wes tern 
Shoshone lost a portion of the ir 
land as a result of gradual encroach-
ment of whites and settlers. 

During the ' 60s and ' 70s, 
Yowell said Western Shoshone 
leadership " began to question how 
and why the U.S. was administer-
ing the land. And they did their 
best to bring this to the attention of 
the U.S. govemment." 

In 1978, the U.S . Court of 
Oaims said $26 mi11ion should be 
paid to the Westem Shoshones for 
land the U.S. government has taken. 

However, the Western 
Shoshones maintain that they do 
not need to be compensated for 
land that has always been Iheirs. 

Yowell also claimed that " no 
Shoshone has receiv ed thi s 
money." 

The documentary film "To 
Protect Mother Earth" will be 
shown at 7 p.m. in Peterson Hall on 
Friday. The movie, narrated by 
actor Robert Redford, features 
Mary and Carrie Dann, two West-
ern Shoshone sisters, organizing 
their people Lo stop government 
agencies from seizing land granted 
to them under the Ruby VaBey 
Treaty. 

"To Protect Mother Earth" also 
teBs the contemporary story of the 
Shoshone people's fight as they 
confront the government in north-
ern Nevada, Washington D.C., and 
at a nuclear test site. 

Yowell said the movie "gives 
viewers a good view of Shoshone 
life. It make viewers aware that 
people are actuaBy losing their 
livelihoods, and are literally being 
put on welfare." 

According to Y oweB, the movie 
is an "e)(cellent" update of the 
conflicts the Western Shoshone 
face, because "the issues are stilI 
going." 

"The U.S. has not done justice 
to the Western Shoshone. All we 
want is due process," Yowell said. 
"We have been willing to negoti -
ate, which means we ' re willing to 
give on some things. 

"You might ask yourself: 'Can 
this happen in the U.S.?' ] assure 
you- it can ,"he said. 

The Dan\1 sisters were previ-
ously documented in "Broken 
Treaty at Battle Mountain," a movie 
by Joel L. Friedman (who also 
produced " To Protect Mother 
Eanh"). 

Yowell said "Broken Treaty" 
documented the "early activities 
of the Dann girls" and their 1974 
conflict with the U.S. government 
over grazing rights. 

The conflict between the Danos 
and the government arose when 
the sisters grazed cattle on govern-
ment land. 

"[The Danos] said it was still 
the Western Shoshone land," 
Yowell said 

According to Yowell. "Broken 
Treaty at Battle Mountain" focuses 
"on the destruction of Pinion trees, 
a food staple for Western 
Shoshones. It also focuses on the 
land and money issue." 

Yowel1 said the movie helped 
raise general consciousness about 
the pli ght of the Weste rn 
Shoshones.

UCSD INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS REC()(iNITION NIGHT 

Jensen, Thomas Alumni 
Senior Award Recipients 
Individual, Team, And Intercollegiate Program 
Accomplishments Highlighted at Banquet 

H EADLINING la t night 's UCSD Athletics Recognition Night at the La Jolla Mar-riol!, Sabrina Jensen and Brad Thomas received the Alumni Outstanding Senior 
Athlete Awards - the most pre tigious of the numerous honors awarded. 

Following a speech by K SD Channel 39 Sport caster Jim Stone, UCSD Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet, who felt that the 200-person invitation-only banquet parallels the 
success of Triton athletics, listed the program's accomplishment this year and since 
UCSD became an CAA Division ill member in 1981 . 

During the 1989-90 seasons. 16 of22 teams participated in postseason play, and UCSD 
records for individual national champions and All-Americans were shattered. A total of 
17 individual titles were captured by nine athletes, skyrocketing the programs ' total to 54. 
Forty-four All-Americans. including four Academic All-Americans, topped last year's 
record 37 - upping the overall total to 332 with 22 academic honorees. 

A national title in both women ' occer and women's water polo continued UCSD's 
treak of claiming at least one championship in each of the last six years, and 12 overall 

by five different teams since 1981. Add that to 17 second-place finishes (three thi yeas), 
and 14 thirds (two this season), and 43 UCSD teams have earned top-three placings. 

The Alumni Senior Awards, presented to the top male and female senior student-
athletes each year, honor those who excel in both sport and cia s. 

Jensen, a double major in biology and English Literature witha 3.7 GPA, earned eight 
letters in track and cross country. A candidate for Academic All-American who competed 
in the national cross country meet the past two seasons. she has been on the provosts' list 
for 12 quarters, is Phi Beta Kappa, and is a member of the Golden Key society. She also 
interned at San Dieguito High School and was a TA in UCSD physiology courses. 

Thomas, who possesses a 3.7 GPA in his biochemistry and cell biology major, and a 
3.32 overall, will be heading to Duke University medical chool. 

Honored as an Athlete of the Year, Thomas ' athletic achievements are listed below. 
The accomplishments of the other II recipients of this year's awards are also listed, in

Champs Crowned 

SW1Af FAGS 16, DEJA VU 9 
ThiS championship duel had all the 

makings of an all-time classic_ Both teams 
entered the contest undefeated. In the 
fa ll, these same two squads had hooked 
up in the title contest with the FAGS steal-
ing the win with a last second goal. The 
SWIM FAGS had tradition, expenence 
and 'leadership' behind them, against a 
young, hungry upstart DEJA VU squad 
that probably had more talent, and cer-
tainly displayed better hygiene. Destined 
10 be a classic, right? 

The FAGS scored early and often, and 
DEJA VUjust couldn't keep pace. Daniels 
continued, ' Everyone knows our biggest 
weakness is OU1 goalie_ Our game plan 
was to control the ball, so they wouldn't 
get that many chances to shoot, and no 
doubt score: Swiss cheese goalie John 
Sklut wasn1 even a factor as the swarm-
ing defense kept DEJA VU out of scoring 
posibon all night. Christy Parker led the 
SWIM FAGS in scoring with four points, 

well balanced teams. The game tumed 
out to be a real snooze as Jim Kirchberg 
poured in four goals to get SLIPPERY out 
to an 11-3 lead at the half. They coasted 
in the second han to take home the cham-
pionship. 

A 
INNERPUBES 13, TOUCH MY MONKEY 8 

Brent Gaddis provided most of the of-
fense in this one sided affair that was not 
nearly as close as the score might indi-
cate. He poured In six first half goals 
which single handedly outscored the 
opposition. INNERPUBES never looked 
back. 

M 
SLIPPERY WHEN WET 19, HOLENOTES 5 

Wrong. 
This was never much of a contest. The 

SWIM FAGS showed up early and even 
brought out their team mascot (a home-
made dummy named Sid, Fred, Herby, 
Wally, ViccrLenny depending on who you 
talked to). Team Captain, Rich Daniels 
growled, 'We may smell and not have any 
sen respect, but Franke can blow up a 
condom with his nose: They were obvi-
ously ready to play. DEJAVU had on their 
game faces, but that isn't enough against 
the demented SWIM FAG mentaUty. 

This championship game was the sec-
ond meeting of the season lor these two 
teams. Just a week ea~ier , they had met 
in a regular season contest, which was 
won by HOLENOTES, 11-10, After lhat 
game, which was won in the last seconds 
when Bill Kuyper threw the ball away, 
SLIPPERY went on a tear and won four in 
a row, including three playoff wins_ 

TOUCH MY MONKEY was a classic 
dark horse which had beaten higher ranked 
teams through the playoffs, but couldn 't 
keep the Cinderella season alive against 
the #2- ranked INNERPUBES_ MONKEY 
never could get the defense figured out 
and struggled all night to just to get the ball 
to mid pool. After every turnover, there 
was Gaddis, ready to capitalize. 

Both squads squeezed inlo the champi-
onship game with one point wins in the 
semi's_ Like the AAA final, on paper this 
appeared to be a great matchup of very

MAY 31,1990 
'With half an eye on history 
And half an ounce of hope ... ' 
INTERVIEW By PATRICIA JmtE 
Arts & Entertainment Editor 

John Wesley Harding, the latest daring new solo artist to Jump out of the 
British rock scene, Is one of the few who are not afraid to carve a name for 
themselves In an Industry where bravado equates business. Previously part 
of the triple-billed Laughter Tour that Included The Mighty Lemon Drops and 
Ocean Blue, Harding will open for Michelle Shocked tonight at the Baccha-
nal. 

Listening to Here Comes the Groom, Harding's U.S. debut album on Sire 
Records, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the number of rock historical 
references. Yet the aUractlve singer Is confident enough to mesh the classics 
with his own biting commentary, producing a 65 minute work that blends 
honesty with cynicism reminiscent of Elvis Costello and Peter Case. 

Harding, 24, is anything but unsure. This Is a man who thought nothing of 
adopting the title of a Bob Dylan album as a stage name, calmly claimed to 
have wriUen in excess of 100 songs In two years, and almost whimsically 
decided to drop out of the Ph.D. political science program at Cambridge 
University to dabble In rock 'n' roll. In a recent telephone Interview, he 
expounded on the world according to John Wesley Harding. 

{Pop music critic for the Los Angeles Times] Robert Hilburn has given you his little 
stamp of approval .. . 

A huge stamp of approval. 
Knowing that Hilburn has made artists successful - artists that the industry would 

have otherwise ignored - how does it feel to have this s/~pport? 
I'm being interviewed now about people who have interviewed me? This is great. 

What was it like talking to Robert Hilburn? It was interesting, he's a very nice guy. 
Very sympathetic towards the kind of music I like and what I'm trying to do. 

Which is ... 
To tuck people like him up. 

I do well. It's good to know what you do well . A lot of people go through their lives 
not knowing what they do well . See, my father has been a school teacher, but what 
he does well is write books even though he's only just had his first book out and he's 

48 now. So there you go. 
About the success in America, 

No, I'm joking. I'don'tknowwhat 
I'm trying to do, but he seems to 
know. All he knows is that I 
write good lyrics and good 
songs and they're not at the

Tthat'swhat he likes about 
me. 

Your music seems to re-
flect a definite sense of self. 
After all, you seem to have 
popped into the music scene 
overnight. 

I'm not an overnight 
success. How could you 
describe me as an over-
night success? [Laughs] 
I've only had one album 
out. I haven't. had any 
success whatsoever, just 
in the form of reviews. 

I disagree. 
Okay. God, it's nice to 

think of myself as an over-
night success. Maybe we 
could stretch it to an over-
night sensation. 

Yeah, we'll just call you 
the music phenomena, 
sweeping America from 
coast to coast. 

That's what I am. But

of myself, but I know what 

Peace and Mus\c at the Price 
Center this weekend. H4 

I hope I haven't captured too 
much attention, because that's always the sure way to be the loser tomorrow, isn't 
it? I've been songwriting forfour years. But, I mean, I didn't really play gigs. I didn't 
even go for a record deal until last year. And I didn't do any gigs until a year and a 
half ago. 

Do you enjoy perfonning live, and life on the road? 
Of course, yeah. I've been doing it since January. I'd better. I'd be a loser if I didn't 

enjoy it, wouldn't I? [Laughs] Whoa, Jesus, what a bad career move that would've 
been! 

'I _hope I haven't captured too much attention, 
because that's always the sure way to be the 
loser tomorrow, isn't it?' 

Why did you sign up with Sire Records? When so many "serious" mUSicians seem to 
enjoy the independent label route, why did you opt for one of the big boys? 

Because at an indie, they can't give you any advertising ... So there's no point 
in me signing with SST because I want as many people as possible to hear my rec-
ords. And the best way for me to do that, because I feel my words are more valuable 
than Debbie Gibson's words, is through a big label. As many people as hear Debbie 
Gibson should be at least able to hear me. 

Besides Ms_ Gibson , who do you listen to now? 
What music am I into now? You mean that's current now? 
Actually, if I were to go through your tape collection that you carry with you while yOl/ re 

touring, what would it hold? 
O.k., let me think. Rick Nelson 's Greatest Hits, Loving Spoonful, Hip Hop's

Acoustic Alibi rotes irself as a "high energy 
rock 'n' roll band." The UCSD qu intet formed in 
fa ll 1988 and since then has gone through three 
singers, two keyboard players, and two guitarists, 

Bassist Michael Talvensaari attributes a stag-
nation in songwriting to the fluctuations in the 
band membership. Current singer Dave Carr 

na l material, each member contributes something 
to the song. 

"Being the drummer, I concentrate more on 
the musical arrangemem, and Dave works on the 
lyrics," Lee said. 

The band members said they enjoy performing 
because they love the energy of a live show. They 
try to concentrate on making their music as in-
tense as possible. They say that what attracts 

said that the main goal 
of the band is to "break 
away from doing cover 
songs and concentrate 
on more originals." 

Acoustic Alibi

the energy and the 
tightness of the band's 

Presently the band has three originals -
"Mirror ," "Walls Fall Down," and Cry" - and 
hopes to write more for a po ible recording 
ession during the summer. "Mirrors," the first 

one writren, has been played extensively on 
KGB's' Homegrown Hour." 

Carr said that each song has its own meaning 
that reaches different people. He explained that 
"Cry" i a song about depression and loneliness, 
while "Walls Fall Down" is a song about the evils 
of racism. Lee added," 'Mirrors' reaches out to 
the children and tells them they can achieve 
anything they wam to." 

Lee believes that the band's biggest influ-
ence, Rush, is evident in its music. They play 
several Rush songs in their set, including "Tom 
Sawyers," "Limelight," and "YYZ." 

"We also like to play Pink Floyd and Led 
Zeppelin songs," added Lee. When writingorigi-

music. 
"We try to be very tight, technically, and 

usually people in the audience will pick up on 
these things," Lee commented. When asked what 
separated Acoustic Alibi from other bands, Lee 
said, "We want to play rock that will make pe pie 
move, not to make them dance , but to feel the 
groove." 

Acoustic Alibi will be performing on June I at 
Revelle Plaza. The current line-up con ists of 
singer Dave Carr, guitarist Steve Wilson, bassist 
Michael Talvensaari , keyboardist Sam Evans, and 
drummer Joe Lee.

If you ever saw 'Rites of Spring,'

A Dischordant Vision of Music 

or vision of music ... I consider it 
something other than business. For 
me it's always contradictory, or it's 
a paradox, to be having this busi-
ness. Knowing that at some point 
when the community dies the label 
will also die makes me feel better 
about what I'm doing," MacKaye 
concluded. 

It evolved slowly but surely, and 
now he's playing guitar. The band,

ASSOCiate ABlE Editor 

Ian MacKaye, singer and gui-
tarist for Fugazi, has certain ideas 
about the way music should be. He 
won't sell a ticket for more than 
$6, will only play all-ages shows, 
and holds the uncommon notion 
that music issomethingother than 
a business. In today's corporate 
music world of Budweiser-spon-
sored rock concerts and upscale 
ticket prices, MacKaye's ideas are 
a welcome change.

plained. "I was in Minor Threat 
then, and all these bands started 
coming up so we decided to pur 
money back from the single inro 

All of these labels have boosted 
their community's music into the 
narional marker. "People always 
say 'Goddamn, there have been so 
many bands out of D .C.,'" 

Fugazi came together when bas-
sist Joe Lally.and MacKaye began 
playing together. "Joe was roading 
for Beefeater, and Beefeater used 

MacKaye's description of Guy 
proved accurate at their show last 
month at La Paloma Theatre in 
Encinitas. The word "energy" is 
used far too often in describing 
live performances. It tends to lose 
its true meaning and becomes 
debunked - the word should be 
reserved to describe shows like 
Fugazi's. 

MacKaye has been involved 
with punk rock since its origins, 
when he formed Minor Threat. 
Realizing that no record labels 
would support his or his friends' 
bands, he started his record com-
pany, Dischord, to do just that. In 
a recent interview, MacKaye ex-
plained the origins and philos<;>-
phy behind Dischord. 

Plcciotto is an enthralling per-
former. He slithered and slinked 
around the small stage, somewhat 
aware of the aud ience, but a lso lost 
in his own performance world. 
Whenever anyone got upon stage, 
he would grab them and start 
dancing rhem around the stage 
with them, at one time ielling a 
guy "(love you." "I love you, too," 
MacK aye echoed. 

"In 1979 we started a band 
called the Teen Idles . ... We played 
for about a year, and at the end of 
the year we broke up, and we had 
a cigar box full of cash, because we 
never took the money from stlOWS. 
It was clearly apparent that no one 
else was going to put out our rec-
ords, and we were involved with 
punk rock, and punk rock says 'do 
it yourself,' so we decided to start

fectly" And man, I said if Joe can 
sing that he can play bass for sure," 
MacKayesaid. Theduo then added 
drum~er Brendan Canty. 

Fugazi's show in San Diego, pur 
on by Lou's Records, was a success. 
It was the first rime the band had 
played San Diego, and the show 
sold out in about six days with no 
publicity, and tickets so ld only at

Diving Into the Core of 'Nuclear Wasted' 
By GREGORY WAYPA 
Contributing Writer 
There' quite a bit that gOe" into 
making a movie, mo t of which we 
take for granted. We're all ondi-
tioned to paying our six bucks, 
getting a big tub of popcorn with 
that extra squirt of "real" butter, 
finding a eatwh reourviewwon't 
be blocked and 
our eye won't be 
stramed, and 
then tryi ng to 
hold back our 
wishes to go for 
the jugular of 
that one sonofa-
bitch, who talk 
throughout the 
fi lm. 

I avingKevin to try and find them. 
Not to ruin the tory, but accord-
ing to LeBeau, "He [Kevin] finds 
omething." 

Becau fits ubject matter, 
and the way it' hown a ort of a 
retrospecti e, LeBeau had diffi-
culty in saying what kind offilm it

While LeB au e cu ed him elf to 
clear up the matter, I had a chan e 
to grill Jamie about behind-the-
s enes dirt. 

Unfortunately, Lerner had only 
nice thing to say about him be-
cau e LeBeau was, according to 
Lerner, "Very open tosugge tions." 

Lerner, a sopho-
more at Muir 
majoring in eco-
nomics, was cast 
in the role of 
Kevin after see-
ing a flyer for the 
part. Lerner en-
joyed hooting 
the film; since he 
and his charac-
ter were so simi-
lar, playing the 
rolewa n'tmuch 
of a stretch. 

"The stuff 
we'd say was kind 
of like the same 
stuff I'd say nor-
mally," Lerner 

Jennifer Kolsky/Guardian said. "You know, 

what does 
go into the mak-
ing of a movie? 
What are the 
technical aspects? 
And finally, 
where does one go 
to make a movie? 
I recently had the 
opportu nity to

Director Josh LeBeau: 'It's anti-art. No, it's un-art.' just 'Dude, 
Production's 

newest film, "Nuclear Wasted," 
with its director, Josh LeBeau, and 
one of it actor, James (Jamie) 
Lerner. 

Why make a movie? Hmmm, 
maybe that's not such a fair que -
tion - besides I've only got two 
hours of tape on which to record 
an answer. 

And when the 
lights finally dim, 
and the projector 
begins to rol/, 
what will LeBeau 
be doing? 'I'm 
gonna watch the 
audience.' 

LeBeau sat there in his ever-
present baseball cap, on this par-
ticulardayfeaturing theNew York 
Yankees' logo. In his mind, Le-
Beau was timing how soon it would 
be before he'd have to rlln and put 
more change in hiS meter. Lerner,

Okay, maybe we ought to give 
you folks a brief synopsis of "N u-
clear Wasted" so you're not clueless 
as to what's going on. "N uclear 
Wasted" i the story offour surfing 
budd Ie (played by Lerner, Eric 
Dechaine, Alexi Villedrouln, and 
Jeremy Pasternak) and the prob-
lems they face after three of them 
get contaminated by a nuclear 
aCCident whtleurfing off San 
Onofre tate Park.

"It's a satire. I think it's funny, 
but I don't think people are gonna 
laugh." It' a relaxed film with no 
real deep meaning and it's not 
meant to hold any interpretation. 

The movie is about twenty-one 
minutes long and was shot in black 
and white. This was not only be-
cause black and white is cheaper, 
but because LeBeau was not really 
familiar with shooting in colo\'. 
Filming in black and white gave 
rise to a fear in LeBeau that people 
were going to see black and white 
and think that it's an art film. 

"But it's not, its an anti-art." 
Okay, anti-art. "No it's not. It's 
un-art ... anti-art makes it sound 
like it's against art. It's un-art." 

Lerner then popped in with a 
truly quotable line, "It is what it 
is. " 

According to LeBeau, "Shoot-
ing was the easiest and mo t fun ." 
They were able to shoot in six days 
over a three week period with only 
one camera. When asked if he 
learned anything from the experi-
ence, LeBeau stated, "Don't let 
the actors drink." He was referring 
to a beer drinking scene that took 
fifteen takes. Fortunately for them, 
the normal contents of the Jack 
Daniels bottle that appeared in 
that scene were replaced with ice 
tea. 

From its conception, the film 
took over one year to produce at 
the cost of about $5,000. LeBeau, 
however, feels the work will be 
incomplete until an audience views 
Although he has watched the 
movie, he feels that he hasn't re-
ally "seen" the film, becau e ".;ee-
ing a movie involves doing It With 
an audience." And when the lights 
finally dim, and the prOjector 
begins to roll, what will LeBeau be 
domg? "1'1';1 gonna watch the audi-
ence," he aid. 

At this pomt during the mter-
\; lew, LeBeau ran off to put m re

You know, what's up?'" 

After LeBeau returned from his 
" cheduled" meeting at the police 
station, we continued the inter-
view with a discussion of the club 
that helped to make this movie a 
possibility: Hardcore Productions. 

Hardcore's purpose is to pro-
vide an opportunity for students to 
work on a film with other people 
with similar interests. It's unlike a 
class where students may begrudg-
ingly work on a movie. The film 
makers produce the kind of film 
that they want to, the only restric-
tion being their imaginations -
and money. 

LeBeau feels that Hardcore is 
an essential part of this campus be-
cause it helps fill the inadequacies 
of the poorly established Media 
Major. According to both men, 
part of the problem stems from 
UCSD's ten-week quarter system 
and the assignments of 2-3 film 
projects per quarter, which only 
allows 3-4 weeks per assignment. 

This is equivalent to, using 
Lebeau's analogy, "Doing a rough

The Price of Peace is Free

me of you might recall 
last year" pring Fe tival for 
Peace, which combined great 
music, great ingers, and vari-
ous ocial and political issues. 
Unfortunately for that fe tival, 
mother nature proved t 0 un-
co perative by casting clouds 
and prinkly weather upon it. 

This year, ASUCSD, in co-
operation with both the Uni-
versity Center Board and 91X, 
is sponsoring the second an-
nual Spring Festival For Peace, 
and this time the weatherman 
predicts a beautiful day. 

The goal of the event is to 
provide a forum for the various 
peace organization on the 
UCSD cam-
pus and in the 
San Diego 
area, in an 
effort to raise 
awareness on 

th activities 
of th e or-
ganizations 
and the is ue 
they repre-
sent. 

The is ue 
that will be 
presented at 
the festival 
range between the achievement 
of inner peace or psychological 
well-being, peace between dif-
ferent ethnic cultures, peace 
with nature and the environ-

draft, handwritten on college ruled 
paper, and turning it in as a final 
assignment." Suggestions and 
opinions are given on the film, but 
they are never acted upon because 
there is no time. 

According to LeBeau, another 
problem originates with the pro-
fessors and classes offered to the 
Media Major: the courses deal too 
much with teaching art, and not 
enough teaching the basics. 

"Faculty should be support and 
information and technical advice 
or context, where they gi ve you in-
formation about resources, etc., 
and less concerned with art," 
LeBeau said. He wants the profes-
sors to help him to be creative, but 
notes that creativity cannot be 
taught. 

Hardcore Productions allows a 

ment, and, of cours , global 
peac . 

The festival will in lude 
reakers representing the vari-
u organizations that are at-

tending the event, such as 
peakers from the UCSD co-

ops, national pokespersons 
from Greenpeace and Amne ty 
International, and Oyama 
Mabandla, a former member of 
the ANC who has been living 
in exile for the past ten years. 

The festival will al 0 feature 
musical artists from a variety of 
musical genres. Scheduled to 
perform are UCSD' own Jam-
bay, the reggae/calypso/funk/ 
ska/rock sound of the Rebel 
Rockers, the rockabilly-folk of 
the Havalinas, and World Beat

only that, Har(kore gives students 
a chance to try 2. icrm of film that 
may not be available 'i.O them from

LeBeau would like to set. all VA

stresses that the populaceshouldn'· 
be afraid to join Hardcore if they 
aren't a VA major. 

According to LeBeau, Hardcore 
will be "back and better than ever 
next year" with another movie 
called "Blood Fall."
