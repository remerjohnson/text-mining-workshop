Council of Deans 
ban fund solicitation 

Watson main opponent of 
RAs collecting activity fees 

By BEN BARTLm 
Staff Writer 

Begll1ning 111 fall 2003, resi-
dent advisors will no longer be 
allowed to olicit activity funds 
from their local on-campus resi -
dents, following a mandate by 
the Council of Deans to elimi-
nate the widespread practice. 
This i sue was brought to the 
attention of the council by Vice 
Chancellor of tudent Affair 
Jo eph W. Wat on, who has 
taken a stance against the collec-
tion of these dues. 

In the past, many RAs asked 
~tudents at the outset of the year 
to contribute money toward a 
house fund. The money raised 
through these efforts provided a 
source of finance through which 
RAs could fund student activi-
tie in the residential halls or 
apartment over which they 

presided. 
IIowever, everal students 

complained to Watson that these 
contributions were not entirely 
voluntary and placed an unfair 
and unwarranted burden on some 
re idents. 

Watson referred the issue to 
the council, which decided that 
the annual $16 per-capita provid-
ed to RAs for student activitIes by 
Housing & Dining Services was 
adequate, and that soliciting tu-
dents for additional revenue was 
unnecessary and unfair. 

"Its not voluntary," \Vatson 
said. "There is a high degree of 
compulsion, and students have 
already paid. When they pay 
their housing dues, they are pay-
ing for a full program that 
includes social activities." 

Watson also argued that

Numerous A.S. senator posi-

The college counCils are aloin 
the process of appointing mem-
ber for other council po ition . 

Marshall was among the col-
leges that were faced with an 
open po ition after the A.S. gen-
eral election. The Marshall 
junior enator po ition was left 

vacant after the only candidate 
was disqualified with the

According to TMC Council 
Chair Travis ilva, the position 
was really never left vacant, 
because the senator position wa 
filled before the transition of the 
new council during fifth week. 
Through a process called "joint 
selection," Billy Ikosipentarhos 
was chosen by a committee of 
counCil members to be appointed 
for the Mar hall junior enator

Scripps prof. presents 
global warming findings 

Professor Doug Inman, founding dlredor 
of the Center of Coastal Studies at Scnpps 
Institution of Oceanography, recently pre-
sented data colleded from a new projed 
modeling the effeds of global warming on 
the Southern California coastline at a pnvate 
fund-raiser for the Califomla League of 
Conservation Voters. 

According to Inman's report, global 
warming hreatens to Increase the rate of 
sea level nse, meaning tha California's 
beaches now face imbalance. He also 
explained that, due to coastal developmen~ 
the available sand for San Diego County's 
beaches IS less than half the supply under 
natural conditions. 

Inman cited studies showing tha~ due in 
part to the absence of sand, 86 percent of 
California's coast is eroding. 

Climatologists have predided that ~obal 
sea level could rise by half a meter or more 
by the end of the century, Inman said. 

SIO scientists, in collaboration with the 
Kavli Institute, are worlong to projed the 
future of Califomia's coast line over the next 
two centuries.

to Younes, the handful of students 
in his hou~e who declined to con-

andagopal also hopes to 
increase communication between 
his office and the council. 

"J want to get everyone who

Nandagopal said. 

Tolin wants the academic affairs

The use of the open roll-call 
vote garnered much dispute dur-
ing the approval process. 

"It was kind of unfortunate [the 
confirmation] didn't happen at the 
meeting," Boyd said. "1 did under-
sund the senators' concerns with 
giving all of the senators the 
chance to have their voice heard." 

Senators opposed to the open 
roll-call method of voting pointed 

out that many of the appointces 
were already working in their 
offices but were not receiving ,uch

Straw polls taken dUring the 
meeting revealed that the issue 
dIVidmg the councal was not the 
confirmatIon of those awaiting 
appointment, but rather the 
method of voting. 

When It became evident that 
some senatOrs were going to 
request open roll-call votes for all 
appointments, Vice President 
Internal Jenn Pae decided not to 
recognize such a reque t. Pae said 
that many in the audience and on 
the council were opposed to the 
voting method. 

The council then overruled the 
chair's decision not to recognize 
the request with a vote of 7-5-3. 

During the ,\-lay 21 meeting, 
Galvon was approved by consen-
sus to fill the office of COmlTIlS-
sioner of communications. The 
council decided not to hold an 
open roll-call vote for Galvon 
because of the time-senSitive 
narure of her office's involvement 
in producing the executive budget. 

The cOUI1cil also appointed Alex 
Kushner to conunissioner of pro-
gramming as an item of immediate 
consideration during the meeting. 
Open roll-call votes are not allowed

tion.

While any of the world powers

vital that the United States be the

that America should pull out due to 
some potential conflict of interest. 

The conflict will be there regard-

not only the right but also the oblig-

Vlhatcver one's opinion of the

stretch to ay that it was America's 
war. Britain, Australia and the 
dozens of countries who played 
smaller roles In the "coalition of the

of troops, tanks and aircraft brought 
in by the United States. 

After carrying the burden of

only fair that the United States 
should have proverbial "fir t dibs"

war. And there are significant spoils. 
For example, Iraq ha the world's

War on Terrorism 
perpetuates fear 

BY EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

Ah, Memorial Weekend has 
passed once again; a holiday 
mostly for picnics in the warm 
May sun, road trips to L.A or 
Vegas, the ideal but probably 
unlikely remembrance of our 
soldiers, and good old sleeping 
in and kicking back. And quick-
ly joining the ranks of long 
weekend and holiday traditions 
is increased security and surveil-
lance around the United States. 

This was the time when peo-
ple flocked to grab their gear and 
head out en masse to malls, trav-
el destinations and national mon-
uments. It has been almost one 
and a half years since Sept. II, 
and the terror alerts and terrorist 
reports from around the world 
are still very much entrenched in 
the evening news and daily news-
papers. After all the money and 
resources the current administra-
tion has pumped into the War on 
Terrorism, has it really been a 
success? While it is true that the 
aI Qaeda terrorist network has 
been severely crippled by the 
United State and its allies, recent 
attacks and the elevation of the 
alert to "orange" indicate that the 
struggle with terrorism is far 
from over. 

1n the past two weeks, attacks 
in both Saudi Arabia and 
Morocco have put many on 
edge. On May 12, suicide 
bombers killed 34 people, 
including eight Americans with-
in the residential compounds of 
Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. In addi-
tion, a tape was released to aI 
Jazeera, a news service in Qatar, 

which fea tured an alleged al 
Qaeda leader urging a jihad, or 
holy war, against Westerners. On 
May 16, a mere four days after 
the Riyadh incident, suicide 
bombers attacked Casablanca, 
Morocco, killing 28 people. 
Again, after investigation of cor-
respondence, movement and 
making of arms, radical Islamic 
fundamentalist groups were sus-
pected, including al Qaeda. 

Perhaps before Sept. 11, 
Americans would have paid less 
attention to an already violence-
ridden and volatile Middle East. 
However, as indicated by the 
almost obligatory terror alertS, 
American attitudes are far closer 
to wary than "whatever." 

Adding to the tense atmos-
phere are emergent reportS about 
the status of senior al Qaeda offi-
cials - alive and well in Iran. 
According to United States intel-
ligence, at least five operatives 
belonging to the terrorist net-
work have been plotting from 
Iran since the American coali-
tion-led overthrow of the Taliban 
goverrunent in Afghanistan. 

And in what increasingly 
seems to be an American Achilles 
heel, the supposed best army in 
the world can infiltrate whole 
countries and bombard outpo ts 
with advanced artillery, but can-
not manage to kill the master-
minds behind the motives. There 
are not yet any concrete reasons 
to believe that Osama bin Laden 
(not to mention addam 
Hussein) is dead, and if anything, 
these recent attacks may quite 
plausibly lead to the most sought-

ing and disputes, even with British 
soldiers. This week, British Lt. Col. 
Tim Collins was accused of war 
crimes by a disgruntled American 
part- time civilian affairs operator 
(who was then mocked derisively by 
fellow American troops). Clearly, 
U.S. troops are trying to handle a job 
they are ill-equipped to handle, not 
because they are poorly trained, but 
because their training did not include 
dealing with the social quagmire in 
which they've found themselves. 

The American civilian administra-
tion is having difficulties as well . After 
the somewhat surprising, but appar-
ently necessary replacement of retired 
Gen. Jay Garner as the leader of the 
Office for Reconstruction and 
Humanitarian Assistance, the public 
has been asking what is going wrong. 
Clearly, Gamer was a risky choice, as 
he had no knowledge oflocal custom-
ary, religious or political ideologies. 

His replacement, Paul Bremer, 
has taken up where he left off, but 
with a much tighter grip. Rumors of 
"shoot-to-kill" orders on looters have 
made the public nervous. The fervor 
with which the remnants of the Baath 
party are being eradicated also is 
cause for concern. It is possible that 
Bremmer may be on to something. 
The Iraqis may respect him more 
because he is so actively pursuing the 
"bad guys," but it's a risky stra tegy, 
and its not turning the electricity on, 
something most Iraqis want more 
than prison sentences for looters. 

What should the United States 
have done in order to avoid this 
nightmare? Many say that they 
should have given up olitary control 
of Iraq to United Nations peacekeep-
ers. This is a difficult request for the 
United States, as most politicians 
would be extremely reluctant to hand 
over the victory to the likes of France, 
Germany and Russia. By submitting 

to the doves in the United Nations, 
the United States would have been 
subjected to all sortS of restrictions in 
areas that they are good at. 

For example, the engineers are 
working quicldy and efficiently, com-
pared to the policing forces. These 
restrictions would be enacted with 
good intentions, usually, but no doubt 
sometimes from spite. However, for 
all the problems with handing over 
the solution to the United Nations, 
the United States would have rid 
themselves of a great deal of trouble 
with only minimal knee-bending. 

The U.N. peacekeepers are well 

" There is much to lose I 
and if the U.S. fails I 

there will be no end to the 
problems an anarchistic 

Iaq 'U " r WI cause .. , 
known for better policing than U.S . 
troops . Their training is much 
more specific in this regard and 
they have been known to work 
effectively elsewhere. The soft-blue 
helmets and berets would have 
helped the Iraqis redirect their 
anger away from the' American 
occupation. It is debatable that the 
'kind-hearted' United Nations 
would not have the ability to make 
the tough decisions, (like shoot-to-
kill policies) and thus would have 
no sway over the Iraqi masses, but 
the United States could have influ-
enced these troops and forced some 
tough action without having explic-
it American flags around the deci-
sion making. 

The UN. bureaucracy itself, 

while at times cumbersome and frus-
trating, is still better at nation-build-
ing than ORHA has proven so far. 
They are far better at working admin-
istrative issues than the United States. 
This is probably because it is so influ-
enced by the European diplomacy, 
which has had to deal with 20 or more 
countries at once, all with specific 
agendas and degrees of extremism 
and without major conflicts. While in 
war times this is a terrible attribute, 
such as in the botched Kosovo con-
flict, it works much better during 
times of peace. 

Finally, this would have been a 
chance for the U.S. to avoid further 
criticism, perhaps allowing it to be 
absorbed by the U .N. This would 
potentially minimize new terrorist 
recruits specifically targeting the U.S. 

British Prime Minister Tony Blair 
wanted wider support for a central 
U.N. role and was probably right in 
his request. The United States has 
chosen otherwise. If the United States 
pulls Iraq together, they will get cred-
it for the reconstruction and many 
economic benefits from the new Iraqi 
government. 

They will also build their reputa-
tion as a nation-builder rather than 
just regime-changers. However, there 
is much to lose and if the United 
States fails, there will be no end to the 
problems an anarchistic Iraq will 
cause, starting with the undoubted 
rise in power by fundamentalist cler-
ics. The United States will also work 
much morc quickly than the United 
Nations, as the bureaucracy will be 
avoided, but just because something is 
done quickly does not necessarily 
imply that it is done correctly. In this 
situation, the United ations' careful 
diplomacy would have been a much 
needed boon to the embattled 
American forces, who are wondering 
why they're still in the desert sun now 
that the war is over.

LEnER TO THE EDITOR 
History of presidency is 

military, not civilian 
denrs as Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. 
Grant, Theodorc Roosevelt, 
Lyndon Johnson? The list of pres-
idents who have not served in the 
military is quite short. 

Forces (not to mention the majori -
ty of Amel;cans) saw it as an honor 
and an incredible morale boosl to 
those who serve. Let us not forget 
that the Lincoln was returning from 
10 months at sea, the longest 
deployment in decade . The honor 
of having the president not only 
visit your ship, bur arrive like the 
heroes of the war in Iraq, and to 
trust the pilots in one of the most 
dIfficult tasks of aviation is awe 
inspiring and far more than just PR.

U.S.-led war, and solving them is the 
United States' responsibility. To 
shi rk its duty and let the burden of 
rebuilding fall upon other countries 
would be an egregious error, rein -
forcing other nations' suspicions of 
the "ugly Americans." Leaving the 
problem to the United Nations isn't 
responsible either. 

The United Nations was not 
happy with this war; getting irs 
endorsement of any military action 
was like pulling teeth. The United 
States should recognize this fact, 
and not ask a body wholly opposed 
to the war to deal with the messy 
aftermath. T he United Nations 
does not need to clem up the mess 
left by the U.S. invasion . America 
needs to finish what it started and 
rebuild Iraq 's economic, political 
and social institutions. 

Despite America's successes in 
rebuilding broken nation into pow-
erhouses like Japan and Genllany, 
there have been a few fai lures. 
Afghanistan's tumble into Taliban 
hands after the expulsion of the 
SOVIet is the most relcvant today. 
llowever, the reign of tile Taliban 
wasn't becau e of J botched 
Anlerican rebuddmg effon. Rather, 
it was the result of America pulling 
out too quickly and leaving warlords 
and extremislS to their own del'i cs. 
In Iraq , U.S. troops must ~tay 
behmd to guarantee stability. When 
thousands of ~ rmer Iraqi troops 
threaten to rebel if they don't get 
their paychecks, the security dilem-
ma posed by a prema ture American 
withdrawal IS self-evident. 

Before U.S. troops can widldraw 
certain conditions must be Illet. 
First, the Iraqi military must be 
under the control of a dcmocratical-
ly elected civi lian governmcnt. 

ext, Iraq must h ave the means to 
rebuild its economy and prevent UIC 
country from plunging back into 
disarray, which means the Iraq i peo-
ple lllust have control of their oil 
reserves. Finally, infrastructure must 
be rebwlt, Illcluding hospita ls, air-
l>Orts and power plants. ~ J-' Linda Vong and Danvin Ruangchan for all their hard work! ~

the "joint selection" process. 

Councils at Warren and Revelle 
are also in the process of selecting 
and appointing srudents to the en-
ate and to other council po ioons.

Revelle College Council will 
also be appointing a junior senator. 
The RCC has conducted inter-
views of the two applicants inter-

the appointment also requires a

The official term of the new 
Revelle senator will begin from the 
time of appointment until the end

Revelle College Junior Senator 
Bishoy Said, the RCC chair would 
vote only in cue of a tie, while the 
vice chair is responsible for the 
appoi ntments process. 

M uir College Council, faced 
with a single vacancy, appointed 
Megan Miller to the position of 
junior senator on May 15. The 
spot, which had been vacant 
throughout and following elections 
for lack of any candidates, had been 
filled on an interim basis by Colin 
Parent in the meantime. The coun-
cil held interviews before voting on 
Miller for the appointment. 

Meanwhile, other colleges, such 
as Eleanor Roosevelt College, did 
not face any vacant positions. 

"ERC pretty much had its act 
together," said ERC Sophomore 
Senator Max Harrington. "Three 
of our senators were elected, and 
we appointed our interim freshman 
senator in time for the second week 
of the new council. We're all set."

Rachel Garcia/Guardian 

Miracle diets don't measure up with experts 
I f moderation is a concept com-pletely lost on you, then you are not alone. Thousands of girls, boys, 
women and men in the United States 
flock to the nearest bookstore every year 
to pick up a copy of the newest fad diet in 
hopes of finding a quick, easy and lasting 
solution to weight control. While all fad 
diets claim to be effective, most are not, 
and those that do succeed in shedding 
pounds fast often come with high prices 
to the dieter's health. 

The appeal of most fad diets exists in 
their advertised effectivenes . The appar-
ent ease and quickness of the dieting con-
stitutes the hook for thousands of over-
weight individuals in the United States. 
Dieting terms range anywhere from the 
24-hour diet to month long diets. 

UCSD strength and conditioning 
coach Mart Kritz expounded on the falsi-
ty of quick and easy diets. 

"The most common mi conception 
[about dieting) is how quickJy you can 
lose the weight when you've spent a life-
time putting it on," Kritz said . 
"Realistically It\. going to take 6 to 8 
months, maybe even a year, and that's not 
what people want to hear." 

Certainly, time i one of the main seil-
ing points for popular diets, including 
those that promise dramatic weight loss 
in a matter of a few weeks, days or even 
hours. Kritz explained that even in the 
apparently uccessful cases of weight loss, 
usually the loss is not a long-term solu-
tion and is not, as advertised, as easy as it 
appear . 

"If it were a ea y as they were mar-
keting it, people would be doing it and 
you wouldn't have to tell them to," Kritz. 
aid. 

This is especially rrue for the latest 
craze of high-protein, low-carb diets, 
including that of Atkins' New Diet 
Revolution, the Sugar Buster's Diet, 
Protein Power and Barry Sears' Enter 
the Zone diet. While some of these diets 
emphasize different foods to abstain 
from, the general theme is clear: eat 
fewer carbohydrates, store less far, eat 
more protein and satisfy your appetite. 
While many health officials do not dis-
pute weight loss from 

" 

opposed the high-protein, low-carb diets. 
While they concede weight los may 
occur, they dismiss any real legitimacy 
beltind these Hollywood fads. 

With the decreased amount of water 
weight, in addition to the fact that the 
body works harder to break down protein 
than it does for carbohydrates, high-pro-
tein, low-cacb diets may in fact lead to 
weight loss. The result, however, can put 
undue amounts of stress on the kidneys, 

especially if sustained 
such high-protein diets, 
they do condemn the 
health ri ks that accom-
pany the deceptively suc-
cessful regimen. The most common 

over a long period of 
time, and can lead to 
renal diseases, heart di -
ease and osteoporosis 
with the increased con-
sumption of sarurated fats 
and cholesrerol in pro-
tein-rich animal products 
such as meats and dairy. 

Terry Martin, UCSD 
director of the wellness 
programs, explained that 
with high-protein, low-
carb diets, much of the 
weight loss is acrually 
water los. ince every 
gram of carbohydrate is 
accompanied by three 
grams of water, eating 
Ie carbohydrate Will 
decrease the amount of 
consumed water, and 
results in significant 

misconception is 
how quickly you can 
lose the weight when 
you've spent a life, 
time putting it on. "

Iioni", coach ucces . Dr. Barry ears

weight loss. This, however, put 
increased stress on the kidney and may 
lead to various metabolic diseases. 

"Tt's futile for most people to sustain 
it," Martin aid. "Over a long period of 
time, it's hard on your body." 

To date, no major health care organi-
zation embraces the high-protein. low-
carb dier. The American Dietetic 
Association, among other major health 
care organizations, has adamantly 

brandishes an impressive resume at 
Ma sachusetts Instirute of Technology, 
and supports his diet philosophy with 
various scientific srudies. Martin, howev-
er, decried these finding, explaining that 
uch studi are i olated review and do 

not hold up against the vaSt number of 
higher-carb nutritional re earch, which 
posse es more longevity and legitimacy. 

Kritz. explained that in the fad diet 
industry, there is "money to be made." To 

be sure, America spends an estimated $33 
million on diet books, pills and diet pro-
grams every year while maintainIng a sig-
nificant amount of overweight and obese 
individuals. 

Both Kritz and Martin attribute 
America's weight problem to stressful 
eating and a lack of exercise. Kritz a serrs 
that most people know what they hould 
be eating and simply look for an easIer 
route. 

In terms of proper nutrition, Kri tz 
clarified that "the old adage still stands: 
65 percent carbs, 25 percent protein and 
I" percent far ." He also described con-
suming sufficient amounts of \'egetable) 
a one of the commonly difficult aspects 
of healthy eating. 

Martin furthermore recommended 
incorporating healthy eating habits fo r 
longevity, and not a "diet," to individuals 
hoping to shed pound . Brown rice and 
whole grains as opposed to white flour 
are among ome of the food Martin 
advocated, as well as indulging your 
sweet tooth from time to time to aVOId 
harmful blngemg. 

The bottom line with fad diets seems 
to be that anything quick and easy about 
losing weight simply may not be true. In 
order to 10 e weight permanently and 
successfully, Kritz. exhorted that people 
have to first ask themselve why they 
want to lose weight. 

"Mo t people focu on the how-to'S 
and not the why's - they don't want to 
go there," he aid. "But if you can answer 
the why question before you answer the 
how-to, then you'll be uccessful."

Students bridge cultural gaps to aid TJ 
Community services builds more than just houses 

By ANNIE YANG 
Contributing Writer 

While mou and of rudent 
paroclpated in this year's annual 

un God Fesoval, a group of 64 
UCSD srudents headed south of 
the border to Tijuana from May 
15 to May 18. \Vere they aware 
that this was one of UC D' 
biggest rradition that only takes 
place once a year? D id they prefer 
a night of Safan-style c1ubbmg 
over rocking out to the sounds of 
Bad RehglOn or enloymg the beats 
of ,\ los Del? 

Ye and no. 
The e members of the UCSD 

Catholic Commufllry eagerly ded-
Icated their weekend, along with 
their hard labor, to rravel down to 
Tijuana to help build hou es at 
three different sites for three dif-
ferent families in need of homes. 

The annual Tijuana House 
Building project is one of the most 
popular service events that the 
Catholic Community at UCSD 
coordinates in cooperation \vith 
the world\vide service organiza-
tion, £Speranza International Inc. 
Esperanza is both a consulting 
agency and a development agency 
that serves as a bridge between 
underprivileged individuals who 
\vish to improve their lives but lack 
the resources to do o . and people 
who want to help and have the 
resources, time and willingne s to 
lend a hand. 

"One of the mam reason why

where the familIes raise the money 
themselves. Everyone works 
together and It really bUilds a ense 
of commurury." 

Participants. both religlou and 
non-religiOUS, had theIr own mdt-
\1dual reasons for attendmg the 
trip . Howe,·er. whether the 
mooves were politically. splTlrually 
or charitably-based, all students 

were able to experience a ense of 
communal effort and achievement. 

"Fir t and foremost, we are able 
to offer shelter to a family in need. 
but the weekend builds much 
more than walls," said Lynn eu, 
the event coordinator. " \ e raise 
awareness and a sense of commu-
nity within our communiry. We 
bridge culrural gaps by working 
with and in another country, and 
we build confidence and dignity 
through families working to 
improve their lives." 

l}pically, building one of the e 
hou es in Tijuana can take up to 
three weeks. Although the group 
was nor able to ob erve the final 
consrruction of the house due to 
their brief three-day stay. the stu-
dent dug foundations for the 
houses at two sites and built a 
retaining wall for the foundation 
of a house at a third site. These 
were very laborious ta ks in which 
ome students suffered from dehy-

dration and numerous cuts and

These were al 0 the same fami-

srudents for each of the days they 
spent at the sites. 

Through the ten years that the 
Catholic Communiry of UCSD 
has been participating in this par-

ticular event. they have observed 
great increases in both funding 
and participation for the trip. 
Recently. the organization was 
allowed to accommodate just over 
60 srudents. During the previous 
eight yea rs, the "po ada," or dor-
mitory- like living quarters where 
the students dwell, were only large 
enough to house approximately 30 
people.

TUESDAY. MAY n. Z003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Baseball: Seniors will miss camaraderie 
cominued from page 16 

playing time, so my biggest accom-
plishment was talcing advantage of 
an opportunity to earn respect 
from my peers as well as myself," 
Miller said. 

Indeed, Miller capitalized on his 
opportunity this year. He started 51 
games in 2003, as opposed to just 
one in 2002. He hit .295 and scored 
36 nms off of 51 hits, which includ-
ed 10 doubles, a team-leading three 
triples and two home rUIls. 
Defensively, Miller had a .958 field-
ing percentage, committing just 11 
errors in 265 chances. He also led 
the team in total bases with 73, and 
executed the short game with six sac-
rifice bunts. The communication 
major plans to travel after graduation 
and then get a job in marketing. 

Triton pitcher Tommy Sereno 
had a I- I record this year with a 6.39 
ERA. Sereno struck out six batters in 
12.2 innings pitched. In 2002, 
Sereno went 2-1 with a 3.77 ERA 
He pitched 31 strong innings and 
struck our 14 batters, while earning a 
save. 

Catcher Kennison started 29 
games for the UCSO baseball team 
this year. Though he was injured, 
Kennison managed to hit .224 and 
put up II runs on 19 hits. He 
smacked two doubles, a triple and 
his first home run in his enior sea-
son. Kennison had a .309 slugging 
percentage, and a .994 fielding per-
centage, committing just one error 
throughout 2003 . 

Outfielder Bologna wa an inte-
gral part of UCSO's success. He 
started 35 games for the Tritons 
before an ankle injury prevented 

him from playing. Bologna's .332 
batting average was third on the 
team. He led the team in runs 
scored with 39, had 42 hi ts, five 
doubles ~nd a home run. Bologna 
drew 16 walks and stole a team-
leading 32 bases. 

Bologna notes that he will miss 
the camaraderie of his teammates. 

"I'U IniSS being out there with 
the guys, sharing great moments 
with each other. I will also miss 
competi ng everyday with this 
bunch, knowing that 30 something 
guys are behind you, rooting for 

" The quality of ballplayers 
and people who continue 
to come into and through 
the program are getting 

better and better." 
- Matt Smith, outfielder 

you and walching your back," he 
said. 

Though Bologna recaUs many 
great moments on the field, it is 
tradition that he remembers mo t. 

"My most memorable moment 
here was the initiation party. That 
is something thaI I will never for-
get. Every new guy gets initiated by 
having his head shaved. Once this is 
done, they belong to something 
special - the UC 0 baseball pro-
gram," he said. 

As a utility infielder, Merrifield 
had a .944 fi elding percentage and 
a .232 batting average. He started 
39 games, scoring 21 runs on 38 
hits. Merrifield knocked in nine 
doubles, a triple and a horne run for 
the Tritons in 2003. He also had 13 
walks and 25 RBis, while maintain-
ing a .403 slugging percentage. 

UCSD pitcher Holloway had a 
7.80 ERA for the Tritons in 2003 . 
He posted a 1-0 record on the year, 
starting three games and appearing 
in nine. Holloway pitched 15 
innings for O'Brien and struck out 
seven batters. 

"This entire group of guys has 
been incredible and it has been an 
absolute pleasure having had the 
opportunity to be around them," 
Smith said. 

Though the loss offour pitchers 
and five fielders will leave big gaps 
to fill, the furure of the UCSD 
baseball program looks prOmising. 

"I believe the program has taken 
some large steps in the past two 
years," Miller said. "This year we 
ran into some injury problems that 
hindered our success, but I believe 
coach O'Brien will continue to 
improve the quality of the UCSD 
baseball program." 

Smith agreed. 
"This program is just gening 

started," Smith said. "The quality 
of ballplayers and people who con-
tinue ro come into and through the 
progT3m are gening better and bet-
ter. Everyone involved with this 
program has very high aspirations 
and expectations for sllccess. This 
program will no doubt become a 
powerhouse in college baseball." 

Track: UCSD team places 20th at nationals 
wntinued from page 16 

runner-up Kortney [hnen, a senior 
frolll Minnesota-Mankato - who 
posted 157'10". Blewitt also fin-
ished second in the hammer throw 
on May 22 and won the shot put 
comfortably with a mark of 
57'6.50", the new NCAA Division 
IT record. 

"It was a very competitive meet 
with a relatively low number of 
athletes. It was pretty much a home 
run for us," Salerno said. 

The three athletes prepared 

for the important meet with 
reduced throws and running 
mileage. 

"Rest and mental preparation 
helped them shake off some 
nerves," Salerno said. 

Through the first two days of the 
NCAA Championships, the Tritons 
tied for eighth place with two other 
schools, with 10 points. 

By May 23, UCSO was the top 
CCAA school at the meet on the 
women's side, with UC Davis the 
clo est at 8.5 points, after seven 

events have been completed. 
At the end of the meet, the 

Tritons as a team finished 20th 
with 13 points. Six of those points 
came from Hernandez in the ham-
mer and shot put, with four points 
coming from Sung and three from 
Allsup. Lincoln University accu-
mulated 98 points to take horne 
the gold trophy with St. 
Augusti ne's College finishing sec-
ond with 67 points and North 
Dakota State totaling 56 poincs for 
third place.

Money and 
sports make 

for a bad 
combination 

Pum's 
Points 

Anu Kumar 

T he sports world is definitely hanging on the hook of the business world. The people 
behind the scenes wouldn't even 
think about putting two NBA con-
ference finals games on at the same 
time or schedule the firSt pitch of 
the World eries when people in 
L.A. were soil sruck In traffic. Even 
in golf, there are the made-for-T\ ' 
gJrnnucks like the "Battles" or the 
pubuClty stunt of having a woman 
golfer pur on a pair of pants and tee 
it up WIth the men on the PGA Tour 
(Annika deserves a standing 0 for 
her TUn, nonetheless). 

Bur those aren't even the best 
examples. There's a kid named 
LeBron James who has got the 
sports-bu iness industry In Ius gym 
bag. Elghteen-year-old James JUSt 
sIgned a deal WIth Ike worth over 
$90 million. Tlus came after a bid-
dIng war between MichaeIJordan's 
company, Reebok and Adidas 
(AdJdas even put up a biUboard 
sIgn In James' hometown, to per-
suade the soon-to-be Cavalier). 

But the let~-make-money-on­
LeBron tour started well before 
Nike gave James enough money to 
go to a five-star restaurant for 
lunch during the rest of his senior 
year at St. Vincent-St. Mary. It 
started vears earlier when he was 
put on ' the cover of nationwide 
sports magazines that dubbed him 
the next Michael Jordan. The tour 
was a bIg reason why James and his 
team played games all over the 
country, and it made basketball 
fans pay to see St. Vincent-St. 

l.ary play high school ball. 
And this is what Pete Bell said 

the world was corrung to in the 
movie "Blue Chips." The basketball 
head coach of the Western 
UniverSJrY Dolphins S3Jd that it has 
become everyone's job to look in 
backyards to find the IS -year-old 
future Stars and make sure that they 
make money on them. 

When Ius team couldn 't help 
but get blown out without a blue 
chip athlete, Bell realized that win-
ning came WIth a price tag when 
the Dolphins' outcomes changed 
after Bell went out and bought 
three recruits before the next year 
to help him knock off No. 1-
ranked Indiana. (UCSD, apparent-
ly, has yet to realize what Bell did .) 

Maybe Bell ~ team that was on 
the short cud of most basketball 
games gave him more heart, but he 
got a few more wins from the team 
that had bigger wallets. And I'm 
sure Western enjoyed watching the 
Dolpluns rack up big wins instead of 
watclung their hearts being broken. 

Maybe business doesn 't mix 
well WIth sports, but it has become 
the fa.ctor of success for teams and 
the games. Money has spoiled the 
purity of athletes' talents and it has 
turned many sporting events into 
auctions. But little ~n be done 
about it now, so will that be cash or 
charge for your next win'

UCSD goes to nationals 
Three Tritons finish in the top six 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

UCSD senior distance run-
ner Audrey Sung, senior discus 
thrower Sara Allsup and junior 
shot put/hammer thrower 
Sagrario Hernandez successfully 
posted top-six finishes in their 
respective events to each earn 
All-American recognition at the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division II Outdoor 
Track & Field Championships 
in Edwardsville, 111. It was a gru-
eling three-day event hosted by 

outhern Illinois University, 
Edwardsville on May 22 
through May 24. 

"We performed extremely 
well with our three outstanding 
athletes ," 
said Triton head coach Tony 
Salerno. 

Sung, a di tance tandoUl, 
finished fifth in a quick 3,000-
meter final WIth a time of 
9:46.28 on May 23 . She prOVIded 
the thIrd-best qualifying time 
dUring May 22 's preliminaries. 
Her fi nals time was over seven 
seconds faster than her eason-
beSt qualifying time entering the 
meet (9:53 .59), as well as her 
time from May 22's prelim 
(9 :S3 .32). 

Sung was already a two-time 
All-American in the 3,000, with 
fifth and sixth-place fini shes over 
the last twO years, respectively, 
and she triumphed as an AlI -
American performer again this 
season. Freshman Yuliya 
Stashkiv of Abilene Christian 
University won the 3000 in 
9:39.94, roughly five seconds 
ahead of Sung, proving how 
tight the competition 
was. Salerno sang Sung's praises. 

"Audrey was awesome," 
Salerno said. 

Sung followed up this perfor-
mance with a ninth-place finish 
in the S,Ooo-meter in a time of 
17:08.02. She narrowly missed 
out on All-American honors, 
since the tOP eIght finishers earn 
that d1sonction. Amber Klein , a

You spin me 'round: UCSD shot put/hammer thrower Sagrano H.ernandez 
finished sixth In both the hammer throw and shot put events at nationals. 
College, was the top finisher in 
the S,OOO, running 16:4 .62 . 

ung had broken the UCSD 
chool record in the 5,000 earli-

er thIS season with a ti me of 
17 :00.26, a mark earned at the 
difficult Mt. San Antonio 
College relays In mid-April. he 
concludes her prolific U SD 
ca reer as a three-ti me AlI -
American in track in the 3,000 
and a one-time cross country 
All-American. 

Hernandez, who had already 
garnered All-American recogni-
tion with a sixth-place finish in 
the hammer throw on May 22, 
provided another sixth-place 
effort, this time in her premier 
event - the shot put. Her toss of 
46'3 .2S" was achieved on the 
fifth of her six tosses. 

Hernandez entered the 
CAA Championships as an 

All-American in the shot put a 
year ago and this 
year 's California Collegiate 
Athletic Association champion 
and school record holder in 
both the shot put and the ham-
mer throw. Her mark of 50'4" 
in the shot put at the 2003 
CCAA Championships bettered 
her own school standard by just 
under a foot, even as she fought 

off an injury. 
"Sagrario had a pretty bad 

injury, which may have held her 
b a c k 
in shot, but she toughed it OUl," 
Salerno said. 

Allsup returned to action on 
May 24 in her specialty - the 
dlscu . Allsup soared to victory 
on the second of six throws, 
with a sixth-place finish that 
earned her All-American hon-
ors. 

"Sara Allsup was tremendous. 
These were her best throws thus 
far," Salerno said. 

Allsup was a 2002 AlI-
American in the event with an 
eighth-place finish . Allsup 
improved on her performance at 
nationals from last year, earning 
All-American recognition for a 
econd consecutive year with a 

mark of IS2'4". Allsup had come 
in eighth at the 2002 NCAA 
Championships, throwing 
147'6". 

Adriane Blewitt, a senior at 
Ashland University, finished off a 
spectacular meet by winning the 
discus. Her mark of 181 '1" was a 
new NCAA Division II record 
and easily outdistanced her from

Baseball 
says 

bye to 
• seniors 

Team loses 
nine to 

graduation 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 

Though the Triton finished 
the 2003 season in sixth place, it 
was atop the California Collegiate 

thletic Association for many 
weeks behind the phenomenal play 
of its seniors. These nine graduat-
ing seniors have seen the baseball 
program move up to Division Il 
and have played crucial roles in the 
success of the team. 

The UCSD baseball team and 
program will miss the dedication 
and hard work of Matt Smith, Alex 
Cremidan, James Sanders, Nigel 
Miller, Tommy Sereno, Man 
Kennison, John Bologna, Matt 
Merrifield and Andy Holloway, all 
of whom graduate this spring. 

Smith has been the starting cen-
ter fielder for head coach Dan 
O'Brien\; ball club. This year, his 
batting average topped the team at 
.339. He also led the team in on-
base percentage at .490 and had the 
most walks at 28. Smith accounted 
for 40 hits, 33 runs, seven triples and 
twO doubles this eason. The man-
agement science major hit three 
home runs in 2002, but says that his 
most memorable moment on the 
field was hitting his first collegiate 
home rw1 in the 200 1 season. 

Smith would like to continue 
playing baseball if the opporrunity 
pre ents itself. He also notes that 
he wi ll miss parts of the UCSD 
baseball program. 

"I'll miss hanging out with peo-
ple who have basically become 
family. These guys have become 
brothers and just being able ro see 
and hang out with my best friends 
is what I'll miss most," he said. 

Due to an injury early in the 
season, Triton pitcher Cremidan 
didn 't get to pitch as much as he 
wanted to. In 2003, Cremidan was 
2-2 with a 6.21 earned run average 
and made II appearances. He 
pitched 37.2 innings, allowing just 
nine walks while striking out 26 
batters. In 2002, Cremidan posted 
the best record on the Triton 
pitching staff at 7-2, had a 3.07 
ERA and struck out 71 opponents 
in 67.1 innings. 

Sanders posted a 3- 1 record and 
had just a 2.15 ERA in 2002 . He 
struck out 31 barrers in 50.1 
innings. Sanders started four games 
in 2003 for UC;SD and pitch d 43 
innings or Solid base~11 with 26 
strikeouts and 17 walks. Though his 
record surmounted to ju t 1-5 , 

anders remained a reliable pitch-
ing source for O'Brien's team. 

Miller got his chance to shine in 
2003 when he won the starnng 
position at second basco
