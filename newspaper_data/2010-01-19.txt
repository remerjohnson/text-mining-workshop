Council 
Racks Up 
Fall Quarter 
Absences

By Megha Ram
Contributing Writer

Several members of A.S. Council 
may face impeachment, if their atten-
dance records at Wednesday-night 
council meetings do not improve.   
According to the organization’s atten-
dance policy, each member is allowed 
up to three absences per year. 

If a member 
accrues more than 
three absences, he 
or she is eligible to 
be nominated for 
impeachment. This 
policy is usually 
enforced by the A.S. 
advocate general, a 
position which was 
vacant during Fall 
Quarter 2009. 

However, new 
A.S. Advocate 
General Parminder 
Sandhu — appointed 
by the A.S. Council 
the first meeting of 
Winter Quarter — 
said he will begin the 
impeachment pro-
cess for any mem-
bers currently over 
the allowable limit 
if they receive addi-
tional absences. 

The impeach-
ment process begins 
when the advocate 
general submits an 
article of impeach-
ment to congress. 
If two-thirds of the 
council votes to pass 

the article, it will be filed with the A.S. 
Judicial Board, which will then make 
the ruling. 

“I feel the number of absences has 
been an impediment,” said Sandhu. “If 
you’re not at meetings, it’s hard to do 
business.”

Seven voting members on the 
council have three or more absences, 
and will face impeachment if they 
receive any more. These members 
include Biological Sciences Senator 
John Ehrhart (7.5 absences), Sixth 
College Senator John Condello (5.5 
absences) and Thurgood Marshall 
College Senator Brian McEuen (4.5 
absences).

Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund and Muir College Senator 
Ryan O’Rear have all accrued 3.5 
absences, and Campuswide Senator 
Carli Thomas has three. 

One-half of an absence indicates 
that the councilmember stayed for 
only part of the meeting.

At the first Sun God forum of the year, councilmem-
bers complained that they were limited by security regula-
tions. Two years after the administration pressured A.S. 
Concerts and Events into instituting a complete makeover 
of the annual Sun God Festival — tightening security and 
confining the festival to RIMAC Field — councilmembers 
are still trying to live up to A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s 
famous campaign promise to “uncage Sun God”. 

Core members of A.S. Concerts and Events met with 
interested students at the first Sun God Festival 2010 
Open Forum, held on Jan. 15, to discuss plans for this 
year’s concert format.

The majority of the two-hour town-hall meeting 
focused on the inefficient entrance policy and the dimin-
ished role of student organizations at the 2009 festival — 
as well as the possible inclusion of a Bear Garden in 2010.

IS
THIS

THING
ON?

A
ll Revelle College junior 
Thomas Dadourian 
needs for his new show 
— “Will It Chop” — is a 

samurai sword. 
But Student-Run Television, 

which is scheduled to resume 
programming on Channel 18 
this week, will need more than 
that to overcome a tumultu-

ous history and 
regain campus 
recognition. 

Dadourian 
and Warren 
College senior 
Ali Hadian are 
the station’s new 
general manag-
ers — installed 

by the A.S. Council last quarter 
to launch a rebranded version 
of SRTV, after controversial 
content brought UCSD national 
media attention in 2005.

In February of that year, for-
mer Koala Editor in Chief Steve 
York broadcast a homemade 
video of himself having sex with 

an adult-film actress. Following 
a debate that weighed the pres-
ervation of freedom of student 
speech alongside concerns over 
tarnishing the image of UCSD, 
A.S. councilmembers caved 
under administrative pressure 
to regulate SRTV’s material. 
The council passed a bill to 
ban pornographic images, the 
broadcasting of “Koala TV” and 
York from the station.

On Nov. 3, 2005, after pro-
grammers aired an interview 
featuring York, the A.S. Council 
voted to shut down SRTV. Four 
days later, then-acting Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary R. Ratcliff refused a 
request to reactivate the sta-
tion’s signal. 

The student body attempted 
to vote against the prohibition 
of sexual content in a January 
2006 campuswide special elec-
tion, but administrators ignored 
the vote and were still able to

Despite a 2.3-percent 
increase in applicants, UCSD 
will enroll fewer applicants for 
Fall Quarter 2010. 

Overall, a record 134,029 
students applied for admission 
to one of the 10 UC undergrad-
uate campuses — a 5.8-percent 
increase from last year’s 126,701. 
Freshman applicants increased 
2.4 percent, from 98,002 to 100, 
320. In addition, transfer stu-
dent applications rose to 33,389 
from last year’s 28,699 — a 
17.5-percent increase. 

UCSD saw growth in its 
applicant pool as well. The 
number of freshman applicants 
increased 2.3 percent — from 
47,708 to this year’s 48,073 — 
while transfer applications shot 
up from 11,428 to 14,286 this 
year, a substantial 27.9-percent 
jump.

The racial breakdown-

sof applicants also shifted. 
American-Indian applicants 
increased 25.1 percent from 
257 to 324, while the number 
of black applicants increased 
by 20.6 percent from 1,612 to 
1,968. Mexican-American appli-
cations increased 5.8 percent, 
from 7,754 to 8.269. 

According to UC Director of 
Admissions and Ethnic Media 
Communications Ricardo 
Vazquez, applicant growth in 
the UC system was the main 
goal of new eligibility require-
ments approved by the Board of 
UC Regents last year, which will 
go into effect Fall Quarter 2012. 
These requirements — proposed 
in Fall 2008 and approved Feb. 
5, 2009 — expand the requisites 
to be considered for freshman 
admission. All California stu-
dents who complete 11, instead 
of the original 15, of the univer-
sity’s required college-prepara-
tion courses, may be considered. 
The minimum unweighted GPA 

has been lowered from 3.0 to 
2.8, and the SAT II is no longer a 
requirement for eligibility. 

In contrast to the passing  of 
the relaxed applicant process, 
the regents agreed upon a plan 
last January to reduce freshman 
enrollment by 2,000 overall, due 
to state budgetary cuts. 

According to Vazquez, the 
UC system reduced its typical 
incoming class by 2,300 fresh-
men last year. However, an addi-
tional 500 community-college 
transfers were enrolled when 
compared to the 2007-08 sta-
tistics. 

Vazquez said the university 
has recently focused on enroll-
ing more transfers.  

“UC is really about the busi-
ness of opportunity,” Vazquez 
said. “Transfer is a cost-effective 
option for many students, and 
UCOP and the regents think 
it’s important to keep the door 
open for them.” 

He added that the university 

was still able to offer a place for 
every eligible student last year, 
but that enrollment may again 
decrease for the upcoming year.  

Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Admissions Mae Brown said 
no enrollment target has been 
finalized.

“We are in the process of 
finalizing the Fall [Quarter] 
2010 undergraduate enrollment 
targets,” Brown said. “However, 
I think that we will continue to 
see a decrease in the number of 
freshmen and a slight increase 
in the number of transfer stu-
dents.”

Brown expects the admit 
rate for Fall Quarter 2010 to 
decrease.  

“We recognize that due 
to the reduction in freshman 
enrollment, we will disappoint 
many well-qualified students,” 
Brown said.

NEWS� TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

AVP Concerts and Events Alex 
Bramwell said he is reevaluating the 
entrance policy — the issue that 
received the most attention at the 
forum. At last year’s festival, 19,000 
students waited in line for up to four 
hours on the day of the event to receive 
their wristbands, due to unstrategic 
buildup of frantic students.

“Last year, there were about 1,000 
student wristbands that we didn’t give 
out,” Bramwell said. “If people came at 
1 p.m. in the afternoon, they got their 
wristbands immediately. But some 
people waited for two hours because 
they were afraid we would run out.”

Campus Events Manager Alex 
Kushner said an ideal entry policy 
would be where students could go 
straight from class to the festival with-
out waiting in long lines. In 2008, stu-
dents could pick up wristbands in the 
week leading up to Sun God, but A.S.  
Council ran out before the concert.

“The biggest fear we have is that 
we give out wristbands during the 
week, and then people don’t show up 
for the event,” Kushner said.

One student at the forum sug-
gested that A.S. Council set up a 
wristband tracker on Facebook, so 
that people could log on the day of 

the festival and see how many tickets 
were still available.

In addition to entrance logistics, 
forum attendees discussed the declin-
ing role of student organizations ever 
since the festival was first confined to 
RIMAC Field in 2008. Last year, only 
four student orgs set up booths.

Bramwell said that A.S. Concerts 
and Events is looking into making the 
booths — which were moved to the 
west end of RIMAC Field last year — 
free for student orgs as an incentive.

Kushner noted that, as evidenced by 
last year’s festival, it is difficult for stu-
dent orgs to generate competitive  inter-
est with the festival’s large-scale activi-
ties, like an inflatable obstacle course, 
a rock climbing wall and a dance tent.

“For the past 28 years, student 
organizations have been able to come 
up with something cool to attract stu-
dents,” Kushner said. “But when there 
are 10,000 people heading over to the 
dance tent, it’s hard to compete.”

However, according to Gupta, this 
year’s Sun God will incorporate stu-
dent organizations by allowing the 
setup of booths outside of RIMAC 
Field, on Library Walk.

Last year’s event marked the second 
Sun God Festival enclosed entirely by 
RIMAC Field. According to Bramwell, 

the A.S. Council is open to fielding 
events such as a Bear Garden in other 
locations on campus, but pressure 
from the administration to maximize 
security makes these activities unre-
alistic — despite campaign promises 
from Gupta to “uncage” the festival.

“Not having the feeling of Sun God 
on campus has been the No. 1 com-
plaint,” Bramwell said. “But having 
people wandering around in a free-
for-all is what we’re trying to avoid.”

According to Gupta, this year’s Sun 
God will actually be more of a campus-
wide event, with student orgs and col-
lege councils adding their own events.

“We’re not going to be able to 
bring back the smaller daytime con-
certs [in Price Center],” Gupta said. 
“But  in terms of the rest of it, like 
booths on Library Walk, we’re bring-
ing those back.”

Kushner expressed doubts about 
the ability to of orgs to handle the large 
crowds that turn out for the festival.

“We’re not in the business of pre-
venting people from doing what they 
want,” he said. “But ... can student 
orgs weather the storm of [a Sun 
God-sized] onslaught?”

The nonvoting members are cur-

into the A.S. Constitution that will 
not require them to attend meetings.  
This proposal will be discussed at this 
Wednesday’s meeting. 

According to A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta, the A.S. Constitution does not 
allow for associate vice presidents to 
be impeached. He said they can only 
be removed by a resolution calling for 
an AVP’s removal.

Sandhu said he begin the impeach-
ment process until after Week Three, 
meeting in order to allow time for 
councilmembers to clear previously 
unexcused absences.

Moderate climes like our own provide a number of benefits — hell, where 
else can you don booty shorts in 
the dead of winter? But there’s one 
endless-summer perk of which only 
the ballsiest take advantage: the 
right to bare arms, legs and paper-
white backsides down at Black’s 
Beach. 

Stashing your inhibitions (and 
underwear) behind one of the more 
distant boulders along the shore is 
an important first step toward ulti-
mate seaside liberation. From there, 
whether the end goal is to rid your-
self of farmer’s tan or merely feel 
nature’s breath graze your lower half, 
there are certain practical measures 
even the most free-spirited among us 
would do well to follow. 

First: Even if you think you’re 
confident enough to shed your 
shorts solo, no nude beach novice 
should tread the pube-littered shore 
alone.

The grandpas in ponytails who 
frequent Black’s may well be harm-
less, but you’ll attract a few less 
uncomfortable lingering gazes with 
the safety of a friend’s hand in your 
own. And on the off-chance that 
a lab partner or other unfortunate 
acquaintance happens to be strolling 
the beach fully-clothed during your 
inaugural free-for-all, seeing that 
you’re not alone might minimize 
the shock (or joy) of learning that 
your curtains do, in fact, match the 
drapes.

Sunglasses might seem an unnec-
essary addition, given your other-
wise accessory-free ensemble, but 
don’t undervalue the importance of 
shielding your eyes from UV rays 
(and flirty widowers alike). The 
darker the lens, the smaller the like-
lihood of provoking bedroom eyes 
from lonely granddaddies.

The shades, however, should be 
your sole accessory. No matter how 
unkind the combined forces of gravi-
tational pull and the coastal breeze 
on your exposed winter flesh, the 
chief objective is to let loose. Though 
a number of casual beach-strollers 
bear sports bras or metal cock rings 
to combat the inevitable flopping 
factor, such precautions counter the 
carefree mentality implicit to nudist 
cardio.

Heading down to the beach just 
before dusk should spare you the 
sight of toasty sixtysomethings tan-
ning face down and leathery back-
side up. It’s also ideal if you’re look-
ing to save a little sunscreen; going at 
high noon will require expending a 
little extra SPF on a few usually con-
cealed crevices. 

If there’s one thing the Guru has 
learned outside this spiritless higher-
education bubble, it’s that with all 
the restrictive vestiges of the morn-
ing’s outfit left carelessly behind, 
there’s no pleasure quite like skip-
ping lecture to watch an explosive 
sunset along the shore — just make 
sure you track down your pants 
before nightfall. The trek back up 
to the parking lot is bleak enough 
already.

ON CAMPUS —  After a year of nothing but 
static — interrupted by five lonely installments of 
“Koala TV” from the Joose-scattered Student-Run 
Television office — a team of film enthusiasts are 
forging their way back onto the airwaves this week. 
They may be momentarily buzzed on the grand-
reopening vibes and one long winter break’s worth 
of pipe dreams, but the SRTV crew will need a 
ballsier, more diverse staff to become the campus 
powerhouse it has the potential to be. 

Prior to this week’s relaunch, the A.S. Council — 
which funds SRTV like a student organization, with 
student fees — decided that the SRTV production 
staff should be held accountable for the past year 
of crackly screen snowstorms. A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta and a small board of fellow councilmembers 

re-opened the managerial positions at SRTV. They 
interviewed standing general managers Ali Hadian 
and Thomas Dadourian — yes, the same winning 
duo under whom SRTV has stagnated all this time 
— and a handful of new applicants.

In the end, they decided to rehire Hadian and 
Dadourian. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the 
channel is destined to fail. Three years after moving 
to a different filming area and receiving double its 
budget from A.S. Council, SRTV finally has the high 
quality equipment necessary to offer more than the 
occasional hour of “Koala TV.”

Beginning next week, the A.S. service is set to air 
“Will It Chop?” — based on thrash-happy Internet 
sensation “Will It Blend?” — and “Cooking with Dr. 
D,” a show on cooking to de-stress. While that’s a 

good (if ridiculously dorky) start, SRTV must strive 
to be a realistic reflection of the college demographic 
and their entertainment desires.

Even if they’re not filming it themselves, the 
managers’ goal should be to air material that draws 
in as many student viewers and contributors as pos-
sible — and not everyone wants to see if a keyboard 
can be hacked in half with a Japanese sword. Or at 
least not more than three times: Lord knows our 
campus channels have a tendency to loop.

It takes more than some awkward Price Center 
flyers to recruit the kind of talent necessary to boost 
the station’s output in quantity and quality. (With 
only 11 members listed on its Web site, the staff isn’t

QUICKTAKES

No matter who is responsible for funding yet another public-awareness tobacco-kills 
campaign, both should be aware they’ll have to get 
damn crafty to earn a second glance. 

Although tobacco giants have been convicted 
of hiding the dangers of their product for decades, 
the days of workplace ashtrays and high-school 
smoke pits are well behind us, and it’s not much 
of a secret anymore that smoking kills. The token 
foreboding image of an old woman sliding a ciga-
rette into the circular cut-out in her throat has lost 
most of its shock value, and there’ve been enough 
viral campaigns and prohibitive state laws to 
ensure no one’s in the dark. 

Targeting young, impressionable children and 
adolescents through television advertisements and 
public school programs may well still be worth the 
effort. But at the end of the day, a campaign’s only 
as good as its audience is receptive — and the con-
tinued popularity of cigarettes suggests we’re not 
as open-eared as the government might like. 

— Trevor Cox 
Opinion Editor

<WJIKKW�1VL][\Za�4I_[]Q\
A 2006 District of Columbia court case ruled that cigarette companies were guilty of hid-
ing their product’s dangers, and that they had to 
publicize those effects in the media. The industry 
is now appealing the decision. 

But several courts have upheld the original rul-
ing, and there’s a slim chance the Supreme Court 
will rule differently. 

Lawyers representing the tobacco industry 
are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Their 
choices? Either settle in court and report the dan-
gers of their clients’ deadly products or continue 
fighting the government, take their case to the 
Supreme Court and possibly lose billions. Industry 
lawyers have hinted they may stop fighting.

Good call. 
Everyone’s most hated suits would be devas-

tated if they lost the case and had to shell out $200 
billion to the government — but that wouldn’t 
necessarily make anyone more aware of the dan-
gers of tobacco. 

Cigarette companies are among the most vili-
fied of businesses, but they’re still an industry 
(almost) like any other; they provide invaluable 
jobs and livelihoods. Cigarette corporations 
should certainly own up to past failures, but 
for the industry today to take such a huge blow 
for mistakes made half a century ago would be 
unfairly damaging to all those who now rely on 
our tobacco addiction to make a living.

Industries that cheat consumers out of their money are common — we do live in America, after all. 
But those which have historically swindled millions 
of buyers out of their lives shouldn’t get off the hook 
without appropriate financial retribution. 

Despite the fact that tobacco companies have been 
supplying people with jobs, the history of false adver-
tisements on which the entire industry thrives justifies 
a government-catalyzed setback. 

The economy may be in shambles, but we should 
still hang onto some scrap of human dignity, and 
realize that tobacco breadwinners are about as inno-
cent and deserving of their profits as a crack-dealing 
neighbor who sells to anyone and everyone. It’s about 
time these fat cats hung their heads, reached into their 
pockets and humbly funded a government-sponsored 
anti-smoking campaign. And they better like it.

OPINION� TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Dear Editor,
As reported in the Jan. 14 

article “Haitian Capital Hit Hard 
by Quake,” a resolution proposing a 
$5,000 donation by the A.S. Council 
to fund relief efforts in poverty-
stricken and devastated Haiti failed 
to pass. This was not because the 
A.S. Council did not have the 
money, but because the majority 
of the governing body thought it 
would create a dangerous prece-
dence that would overturn standing 
rules on giving student fees and 
funds to a country so desperately in 
need of such aid. 

The council debated the issue 
for a little over an hour, quib-
bling about whether giving such 
an amount of money was within 
the council’s rules. What appalled 
me the most was that my fellow 
councilmembers, educated and 
knowledgeable representatives who 
decide on and know the student 
body’s best interests, could sit there 
and argue over giving immedi-
ate aid to alleviate the suffering of 
their brothers and sisters in Haiti. 
Imagine if members of Congress 
quibbled over the legality of giving 
federal money to fund relief efforts 
in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina, only to issue a press release 
stating that they stand in solidarity 
with the victims of the hurricane. 

If members of the council were 
keen on actually representing the 
student body’s best interests, they 
would have approved the resolution 
without hesitation, as opposed to 
merely standing in solidarity with 
the victims of the earthquake. Quite 
simply, my fellow councilmembers 
failed to take into account the brev-
ity of the situation in Haiti. With 
over 50,000 people dead in a coun-

try essentially forsaken by most 
developed countries, my fellow 
councilmembers failed to take into 
account the human factor. They had 
the power to amend such standing 
rules, but they felt that violating the 
rules was a much more serious and 
pressing issue than sending the best 
form of aid available to a country 
reeling from the aftershocks of the 
earthquake and extreme poverty. 

It begs the question, where are 
the council’s priorities? Certainly 
not in alleviating the suffering of 
Haiti’s denizens. Such a disconnect 
from the tragedy and horrors of 
a natural disaster only reveals the 
council’s callousness and lack of 
concern for anything that is per-
ceived as not germane to student 
affairs at UCSD. 

I understand that rules and laws 
must be followed in order to estab-
lish precedence and prevent chaos 
from reigning. But such man-made 
laws must be disobeyed in order to 
adhere to the higher law command-
ing us to be our brother’s keeper, to 
be responsible for securing the gen-
eral welfare of all — especially those 
in dire need. Never have I seen such 
a casual disregard for the welfare of 
one’s fellow human. It seems that 
Haiti has already been forsaken 
and forgotten by the Associated 
Students of UCSD.

large enough now to take on much 
more than a weekly cooking show 
and destruction-fest — and those too 
may slip from priority).

SRTV could create an internship 
program to recruit visual-arts and 
film students to join its crew. In such 
a competitive job market, no one 
can have too much experience; an 
internship program (the less paid, 
the better!) could attract a slew of 
applicants. 

Another first step SRTV must 
take is to streamline its Web site. 
With links to a two-year-old forum, a 
schedule with no listings and a mem-
ber roster from early 2008, it’s far 
from user-friendly. SRTV could take 

some tips from UC Berkeley’s CalTV 
Web site, which features both a 
weekly updated schedule and instant 
access to the station’s latest videos.

Once SRTV debuts, posting its 
shows to the Internet would allow 
students to tune in more often, con-
sidering its current low profile.

CalTV also covers daily investiga-
tive news, sports, comedy and music. 
Even better, UCLA airs Dorm Life, a 
massively popular channel that covers 
everything from hyperactive RAs to 
the weird theater kids down the hall.

No one’s expecting SRTV to leap 
such great telecasting strides over-
night, but inspiring outside student 
involvement could be the key to the 
creative floodgates. SRTV could also 

take some lessons from our own 
individual colleges’ TV channels: 
Marshall’s TMTV, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College’s ERCTV and Revelle’s 
RCTV are making themselves vis-
ible by posting on YouTube, vetting 
Facebook groups and updating a 
Twitter feed.

It may be tempting to write off 
the latest Channel 18 relaunch as 
superficial after the A.S. Council 
rehired the same guys who couldn’t 
manage to air a thing for a year and 
half. But let’s make this for the stu-
dents, by the students — not just a 
few kids with expensive cameras.

broadcast signal because the university owns 
the Triton Cable Network, which transmits 
SRTV programming.

Ratcliff and then-Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson wanted to 
employ a review board to evaluate content 
before it aired, and wanted the station’s charter 
to ban “graphic depictions of sexual nudity.” 

When the A.S. Council did not include 
Ratcliff and Watson’s demands in their charter, 
the university released its own “acceptable use 
policy” in October 2006.

Prior to that, SRTV had been allowed to 
come back on air in June 2006 under certain 
restrictions: The station could only broadcast 
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. That’s 
when Hadian joined the SRTV crew. 

“The station itself was very outdated,” he 
said. “As far as SRTV itself went, there wasn’t 
much going on. It was pretty defunct.”

Hadian moved into a managing position 
after SRTV set up shop in a new Student Center 
studio and upgraded to new equipment. 

“We got a brand-new space, but we had a lot 
of problems,” he said. “For the first two years of 
managing, there were a lot of obstacles in set-
ting up the station and getting operational.”

Since then, the station has been shuffling 
along with the help of the Koala, whose mem-
bers helped set up the studio and provided the 
station’s only content last year — in the form 
of a late-night talk show, on which hosts often 
got drunk and removed items of clothing while 
answering calls from around campus.

“They were filming their own shows, which 
did push [the] envelope as far as acceptable 
content [goes],” said Hadian, now in his sec-
ond year as manager. “That upset [the A.S. 
Council], because we felt we were going in a 
backwards manner … SRTV is not supposed 
to show that in the first place.”

In October 2009, Gupta decided to moti-
vate the production process by exercising 
effective regulation, and put SRTV under the 
council’s control. In the past, SRTV acted as a 
student organization funded by student fees; 
now, it is considered an A.S. Council service.  
Gupta said that a new policy will ensure all 
content be under council jurisdiction, and will 
require all programming to be filtered through 
principal members of SRTV.

So Gupta opened the application process to 
hire new leadership, and held a series of inter-
views with aspiring station managers.

In the past, outgoing SRTV staff members 
made recommendations to the A.S. Council on 
who they wanted to be general manager.

According to AVP Student Services 
Meredith Madnick, the council also met with 
prospective applicants face to face, outside of 
the formal interview, and made their expecta-
tions of the station’s management clear. 

“We’re now making SRTV not simply a 
venue where students can produce content, 
but it is actually an entity that is responsible for 
creating content,” VP Finance Peter Benesch 
said. “It’s actually not just a place where people 
who are bored and want to make a show go, 
it’s a place where you go if you want to become 
part of SRTV and be responsible for producing 
content … It’s a pretty big shift from what it 
[was] before.”

According to Madnick, council members 
made these managerial changes because they 
wanted to prevent possible injury to the sta-
tion’s facilities and reputation, and reinstate 
SRTV’s previous recognition around campus.

Out of the five applicants, Hadian was 
chosen as a manager because of his familiar-
ity with SRTV, and Dadourian because of his 
background in professional production.

“Ali is a very good station manager because 
of all the specialized knowledge he had in 
terms of what it literally takes to put on pro-

grams and how to run a station,” Benesch said. 
Dadourian has worked as an actor, a 

production assistant and an office intern for 
Oscar-winning film producer Scott Rudin. 
Dadourian was also enrolled in a summer 
seminar at the USC School of Cinematic Arts 
and is a member of the Screen Actors Guild.

Though he was also a principal member of 
SRTV last year, Dadourian said he felt hesitant 
to become more involved.

“As a member, I didn’t really know that 
much about SRTV, and was just hesitant to get 
involved [because] stuff was poorly organized. 
It wasn’t an inspiring place to be involved,” said 
Dadourian. “Most of the members were from 
the Koala, and I didn’t like how they do film 
productions.”

So when Gupta opened up the managing 
position again last quarter — under the pre-
tense that the station would be more heavily 
regulated by the A.S. Council — Dadourian 
was quick to apply.

“That’s when I kind of decided that I’m not 
going to sit around and be a follower,” he said. “I 
really wanted to help people to get things going 
and bring a more professional side to SRTV.”

In his new position, Dadourian said that he 
feels a greater power to push things along.

“As general manager, I feel like I have the 
responsibility now to make sure that stuff hap-
pens. I really enjoy being able to get things 
going because when I was a member, I took 
a more observational role and wasn’t able to 
organize stuff.”

Madnick said she and the two managers 
will regularly keep in touch, and content-
approval forms will be used to regulate the 
shows before they air.

Warren College senior Shane Grant, who 
has been working as an SRTV technical direc-
tor for three years, thinks the two-pronged 
management system (Hadian and Dadourian) 
is better than having one manager.

“It’s a bit better actually. If you only have one 
person in charge and you can’t get in touch with 
that one person, then things get stalled,” he said. 
“But with two people in charge, you can split 
the responsibility. I guess it can get a little bit 
more hectic, but I think we’re pretty organized.”

However, current members of radical 
humor newspaper the Koala — a student 
organization that has been airing its content on 
SRTV since the ’80s — have expressed disap-
pointment with the new system.

“I don’t really agree with the whole co-
manager position that they’ve assigned. I think 
it creates a dichotomy [where] they can’t do as 
well as they could, but they’re making a good 
effort and they’re making good plans,” associate 
Koala editor Wes Field said. “I don’t agree with 
the ideas of going ‘Hollywood’ and getting paid 
and getting advertisement — but I don’t know 
if that’s the whole purpose of SRTV. I think it’s 
about entertainment.”

Dadourian said he plans on establishing 
SRTV as a respected media outlet for all facets 
of student life, from academics to social activi-
ties around campus.

“I want to take away the prejudice about 
how ‘socially dead’ the campus is and bring the 
campus together,” he said.

Though Channel 18 is still no more than 
static, station managers and A.S. council mem-
bers seem confident that several shows will 
launch later this week.

“Thanks to our new managers at SRTV, 
we’ve actually exponentially increased the 
amount of programming that it covers,” said 
Gupta. “The amount of stuff that’s going to hit 
the network is amazing. The station came from 
being nearly dormant last year to being very 
active in filming different events across campus.”

Dadourian and a small crew is currently 
filming commercials for student organizations

Complete with go-go dancers and L.E.D. lights 
from Daft Punk paradise, Voyeur transform

 itself every evening into a goth-glam den. 

Lest any Gaslamp District newbies get the wrong impression, let’s get the disclaimer out of the way: 
Voyeur is a nightclub. As such, expect the 
staples of any fine downtown-SD estab-
lishment: weak, expensive drinks; rude, 
aloof bouncers and $20 no-list cover on a 
normal night ($40 for well-known talent, 
a la the MstrKrft and LA Riots show).

Despite its predictable club swag, 
Voyeur is a smart destination for 
Restaurant Week — an annual event dur-
ing which over 180 San Diego restaurants 
offer three-course pre-set menus for $20, 
$30 or $40. Make a dinner reservation 
for later in the evening and stay for the 
club: You’ll get three dishes for 20 bucks, 
and you won’t have to pay for cover. 
Choose from most of the options on its 

tapas-style menu 
— including 
the duck-confit 
tamales, lamb 
pops and banana 

fritters — then dance all the calories off.
As a relatively new venue, Voyeur 

has yet to develop a pigeonholed set of 
patrons (despite bumping electro and 
house music on regular rotation, and 
donning uber-hip goth-inspired decor). 
The crowd is hit-or-miss depending on 
who you are and who you’re looking for: 
On any given evening, you might find 
yourself getting crept on by Ed Hardy 
douche bags, stepped on by pompa-
doured sisters in low-cut minidresses and 
out-danced by arm-flailing hipsters with 
dilated pupils.

If you’re going dilated, take some 
time to trip out on the impressive L.E.D. 
wall — including go-go dancers gyrating 
inside of it on prime nights. San Diego 
Restaurant Week only lasts from Jan. 17 
to Jan. 22, but Voyeur’s 3-for-$20 deal 
will be available through the end of the 
month.

INFOCUS WINTER GAME FEST 2010

This weekend, video gamers from across SoCal and the darkest corners of our six-college sprawl gathered at the 
sixth annual Winter Game Fest: a video-game 
tournament chocked with 48 consoles, 72 
television screens and 12 projectors; from 10 
a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday through Sunday.

At this year’s event, the tournament added 
new  games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee, 
Madden 2010 and Call of Duty 4 to its menu 
of competitions, while staples from last year 
— including Guitar Hero, Starcraft and Halo 3 — 
stuck around. 

Aside from getting in on tournament action 
— which included separate competitions for 
each video game — participants also played on 
older consoles like Nintendo and Sega Genesis, 
basking in game-inspired art adorning the walls 
of the Price Center Ballrooms. 

With approximately $5,000 in cash prizes, this 
year’s fest attracted over 1,000 sets of the fastest 
fingers on the West Coast.

HAITI EMERGENCY RELIEF NETWORK

I n the aftermath of the 7.0 quake that has already claimed an estimated 200,000 lives in Haiti, a new coali-
tion of UCSD students is focusing on 
how it can help those still alive. 

On Wednesday, Jan. 13 — while 
the fault lines running under Port-au 
Prince trembled in aftershock — Muir 
College senior Kenny Pettersen cre-
ated a Facebook event for a glowstick 
vigil (to be held the following eve-
ning) and planned to fundraise from 
a booth on Library Walk for the rest 
of the week. 

“I got tired of watching things on 
the news, and realized that there are 
a lot of resources here at UCSD, and 
a lot of students that have different 
gifts,” Pettersen said.

By Thursday night, Pettersen had 
accumulated 1,400 Facebook follow-
ers and raised over $3,000.

“It’s been amazing how well the 
school’s responded to everything,” said 
Pettersen. 

For now, the network is mainly 
operating as a Facebook group (with 
568 members as of Monday night), but 
Pettersen said this Tuesday’s meeting 
will possibly decide the group’s future 
(as an official student organization) as 
well as facilitate new fundraising ideas.

“There’s going to be help needed 
for many, many years to come,” 
Pettersen said. “At least for the rest 

of the school year, we’re going to be 
doing as much as possible to get stu-
dents involved.”

Though the nearly $5,500 the net-
work has collected so far will be going 
to the American Red Cross, many 
members are eager to discuss other 
options for long-term development 
in the country — not just emergency 
relief. The destruction that stretched 
out from the earthquake’s epicenter 
has decimated much of the country’s 
infrastructure; collapsing countless 
homes, hospitals, businesses and gov-
ernment buildings.

“From my experience, Haiti has 
needed a lot of long-term develop-
ment even before the earthquake,” 
Pettersen said. “And now with the 
earthquake, it has created so many 
more issues.”

This past July, Pettersen took his 
seventh medical trip to Haiti. Though 
he plans to attend medical school in 
the fall, he said hopes that the stu-
dent group can continue to help the 
Caribbean country under new leader-
ship.

The UCSD Haiti Earthquake 
Response Network will hold its 
first meeting at 7 p.m. on Jan. 19 in 
Conference Room 513 of the Student 
Services Center.

CLUBHOPPING

JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN

and making a music video for Lady 
Gaga’s “Teeth.” 

The psychology-based cooking 
show “Cooking with Dr. D.” aims to 
release academic anxieties: The show 
features a clinical psychologist from 
Los Angeles who discusses stress-
management strategies by cooking. 

“Triton Vision Recap” — in its 
pre-programming stages, according 
to Dadourian — will feature sports 
updates, and “Will It Chop?” will be 
compromised of one-minute videos 
that feature a katana (Japanese sword) 
chopping household items like key-
boards and phones.

“It’s a good illustration of how we 
can have TV shows that are more pro-
fessional and serious, and that we can 
also have shows that people just shoot 
in their backyard,” Dadourdian said.

Another proposed show aims to 
interview UCSD professors about 
where they came from and what 
opportunities they have for students.

“It’s introducing the diverse profes-
sors we have at UCSD to the student 
body; it’s a way for students to get 
involved,” Dadourian said.

So far, the station managers have 
spoken to John Moore, a linguistics 
professor who dropped out of college 
to pursue flamenco dancing in Spain.

SRTV will also feature a weekly 
address by Gupta — giving updates 
on A.S. Council and Office of the 
President operations — along with 
sports games, student-org events and 
on-campus concerts. 

“What we’re witnessing now is the 
rebirth of SRTV as something more 
mainstream in campus life,” he said.

Koala members have made it clear 
they plan on staying involved with 
SRTV by providing comedic content 
and focusing on student-life coun-
terculture. According to Field, the 
Koala will still be hosting a talk show 
(similar to last year’s) where students 
can call in and discuss the “topic of 
the day.” 

“Now that SRTV is back, we’ve 

been waiting the whole quarter to 
get started. We think it’s going to be 
something that people can be excited 
about,” Field said. “We want to do a 
lot more with pre-recorded stuff.”

So far, he said they have written a 
comedy sketch on a self-defense class 
with Tiger Woods. “We’ll show you 
how to defend yourself if you’re a 120-
pound blonde girl,” Field said.

They also plan to film parties 
and host recreational activities like 
“Fraternity Olympics”.

Following Federal Communication 
Commission guidelines, the Koala will 
be broadcasting their shows after 10 
p.m., as they will be expected to air 
“indecent” material.

“The only thing that they’re regu-
lating is porn, because that’s what we 
did in the past. So we won’t be airing 
any porn … [not] immediately, any-
way,” Field said. “But other than that, 
we still generally follow the guidelines. 
We’re going to air out the tent, so we 
really won’t be doing anything that 
anyone can really get upset about.”

Film-crew members who contrib-
ute to show production will be able to 
earn money in a work-study program 
that Gupta implemented in SRTV’s 
new charter.

I think it’s going to be successful; 
it’s going to lead SRTV to be much 
more productive and really record a 
lot more of student life,” Gupta said. 
“They’ve been going around and 
recording student-organization events, 
helping me record my podcast and 
addresses. They’ve been really proac-
tive in recording events that students 
want to have recorded, and maybe 
want to watch later on if they can’t 
make it to these events.”

Now that SRTV is considered an 
A.S. service, it will receive additional 
funds — a result of the activity-fee ref-
erendum last year. In the current A.S. 
budget, SRTV has $11,000 to spend 
this year on operating expenses and 
the work-study program.

With that money, the station has 
already bought two new high-defini-

tion video cameras and has converted 
from an all-analog to an all-digital 
station, so content can be uploaded 
directly from cameras and computers.

“We have state-of-the art, cutting-
edge technology as far as broadcasting 
and filming equipment goes,” Hadian 
said. “Before, we were basically run-
ning off VHS tapes. We had an entire 
back room full of them, so it was real-
ly hard to find the content we needed.”

To increase viewership, Gupta said 
SRTV is in the process of making con-
tent available online so that students 
living off campus can tune in.

“What we’re trying to do is gain 
more of an off-campus presence than 
we have before, to reach the other half 
of the student community that doesn’t 
have access to the on-campus cable,” 
said Gupta. “We’re doing this by try-
ing to get our feeds online, so you can 
watch SRTV right in the convenience 
of your own computer.”

But there is still much to be done. 
Grant said the because the studio 
floor is made of tile instead of car-
pet, unwanted sounds become more 
noticeable — like ATM transactions, 
drunken conversation from Porter’s 
Pub and blaring beats from the Deejay 
Vinylphiles Club next door.

The A.S. Council and SRTV’s new 
management seem the most optimis-
tic about the station’s new changes.

“I really want to see SRTV shine,” 
Dadourian said. “I’ve been here while 
SRTV’s kind of been in the dumps, 
and I really want to see it do well. I 
really think it has the potential to do 
well and be successful.”

Five years from now, Hadian said 
he sees SRTV as a grounded, profes-
sional television station.

“If we don’t run into any more 
outrageous content, like porn being 
aired again, we’re going to be pretty 
robust on campus,” he said. “SRTV 
will be a popular go-to station for the 
on-campus population.”

“Everyone swam really well today, 
and there were a lot of touch-outs 
where we won in the very last sec-
ond,” Shimura said. “It was really 
exciting, but nerve-wracking at the 
same time.”

In the 200-yard freestyle, Henley 
won by two-hundredths of a second, 
O’Brien lost the 100-yard breaststroke 
by two-tenths of a second, freshman 
Amber Tan dropped the 50-yard free-
style by three-hundredths of a second 
and Shimura won the 100-yard free-
style by half a second. It was an incred-
ibly close day, but the Tritons overcame 

their injuries to claim victory in more 
close races than not.

The best race for UCSD was the 
200-yard butterfly: The Tritons took 
all three top spots, led by senior Karla 
Holman’s time of 2:09.70. In their last 
race, the 400-yard freestyle relay — 
Shimura, Tan, Tse and Ferguson — 
won with a time of 3:30.65.

“There is definitely more prepara-
tion going into the meet against an 
in-city rival,” Shimura said. “Before 
the meet we had a motivational speech 
from [head coach] Scott [McGihon], 
and that pumped us up.”

The Tritons are back in action 

next weekend at Canyonview Pool 
for their last home meet of the year, 
which will be against California Baptist 
University.

It will be senior day — the last 
chance for many Triton swimmers to 
swim at their home pool before the 
final championship races.

“I want to have fun with it next 
week,” Cunningham said. “I just want 
to enjoy my last meet at home and be 
with the team. But season-best times 
would be great.”

forced several turnovers that let them 
back into the game. UCSD took its 
first lead with 11:22 left in the first 
half, after Carlisle received a kick-out 
pass from senior guard Leilani Martin 
and knocked down a three — despite 
being fouled in the process. She then 
converted the free throw into a four-
point play. 

The give-and-take of the first half 
was reflected in the score: The teams 
went into halftime tied at 
32. 

“Every team is going 
to have their best game 
against us, and they are 
going to be emotion-
ally high,” junior forward 
Tiffany Hunter said. 

This was the first time 
in four games that the 
Tritons did not have the 
lead at halftime. But head 
coach Charity Elliot said 
she refused to panic. 

“Our mentality every 
game is to remain poised 
and calm,” Elliot said. “So 
even when teams come out 
and jump out to a lead, 
we talk about being steady 
and just doing what we 
need to do.” 

The Tritons came out 
of the locker room with 
new found intensity and took the lead 
with an Erin Noonan bucket at the 
17:54 mark — a lead they would not 
relinquish. San Francisco State, howev-
er, tried to stay in the game with tough 
work on the glass, out-rebounding the 
Tritons 38-32 and creating nine sec-
ond-chance points in the second half.

The Gators cut the lead to nine after 
a three-pointer by Andrea Ohlssen 
with 5:09 remaining. Ilg answered 
back with a three of her own, and the 
Tritons kept a double-digit lead for the 
remainder of the contest. 

The game against CSUSF capped 
off a four-game home stand in which 
the Tritons defeated their opposition 
by an average of 16 points. The win 
improved the Triton season record to 
14 unbeaten, 9-0 in conference play, 
right on the heels of a close 68-63 
win over Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Thursday Jan 14. 

The Tritons survived a furious sec-
ond-half comeback against the Otters. 
UCSD took a seemingly comfort-

able 35-20 lead into half-
time, but a feisty CSUMB 
refused to go away. The 
Otters poured in seven 
second-half three-point-
ers and shot 45 percent 
from the field, cutting the 
lead to one point with 
2:15 remaining. However, 
UCSD never surrendered 
the lead, making all their 
free throws down the 
stretch for the win.

The Tritons were paced 
by sophomore Chelsea 
Carlisle, who scored a 
game-high 20 points 
— including nine of the 
team’s final 11 points. 

The close game against 
CSUMB followed two rou-
tine victories. Head coach 
Elliott said she was able to 
see the positives of with-

standing the comeback.
“I remind the team daily: It’s a 

process. And right now, we are still not 
as good as we need to be,” she said. “It 
reminds us that we have a lot of work 
to do.”

The Tritons will take a two-game 
road trip this week, with a matchup on 
Thursday at Humboldt State, followed 
by a game on Saturday at Sonoma 
State.

Athletes and administrators 
joined forces last Friday, Jan. 15 in 
the Green Room at RIMAC Arena 
to donate their blood at the UC San 
Diego Athletic Department’s 10th 
annual blood drive.

The event, hosted in conjunc-
tion with the American Red Cross, 
was organized by the Triton Athletes 
Council — a forum of student-ath-
lete representatives from UCSD’s 23 
sports teams — as a part of its com-
munity service initiatives.

Senior Associate Athletic Director 
Ken Grosse collaborated with the 
TAC. He  said the event demonstrates 
the athletics department’s commit-
ment to excellence on and off the 
field. 

“We’re completely focused on suc-
cessfully competing on the court and 
in the field,” Grosse said. “However, 
equally important to us is success in 
the community.”

According to Grosse, the blood 
drive is the largest on campus, and has 
also been named the No. 1 Southern 

California University donator by the 
Red Cross for three consecutive years. 
This year’s drive yielded 128 usable 
units — a 13-unit improvement over 
last year’s.

According to Grosse, approxi-
mately two-thirds of donations gen-
erally come from student-athletes. 
Over the course of the afternoon, 
different teams came in together to 
make their contributions.

Though nervous about giving 
blood for the first time, Robert Sedin, 
a senior center fielder on the UCSD 
baseball team, said he was happy to 
contribute to an important cause.

“Every one of us makes a differ-
ence” Sedin said. “People everywhere 
need blood, and when all the athletes 
get together, it’s really special.”

However, Sedin said he was appre-
hensive about the procedure.

“I have personally never given 
blood, and am a little scared,” he 
said. “The thought of losing blood is 
creepy — I hope I don’t pass out.”

The blood drive, which was open 
to the general public, attracted many 
faculty members and alumni.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 

Penny Rue, one of the faculty blood 
benefactors, spoke nostalgically about 
her first time at a blood drive.

“The first time I gave blood was as 
a freshmen in college, because there 
was an on-campus blood drive,” Rue 
said. “I have been donating blood 
ever since”.

Rue stressed that giving blood 
now will help Red Cross in its earth-
quake relief efforts in Haiti.

“Right now is especially impor-
tant for the Red Cross,” she said. 
“This is a great opportunity for the 
Athletics Department to foster com-
petition between athletes towards a 
greater goal.”

Juanita Lake, team supervisor for 
the Red Cross, shared enthusiasm for 
the event.

“What a lot of people don’t know 
is that one in three people is in need 
of donated blood,” Lake said. “In San 
Diego, only 3 percent of the popu-
lation donates blood, so UCSD is 
definitely doing their part in trying to 
raise awareness.”

“Our mentality every game is to 
remain poised 
and calm. So 
even when 
teams come out 
and jump out 
to a lead, we 
talk about being 
steady and just 
doing what we 
need to do.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After a disappoint-
ing 62-66 loss against Cal State Monterey Bay 
on Thursday night, the UCSD men’s basket-
ball team looked to redeem itself against San 
Francisco State on Saturday. After 50 minutes 
of gut-wrenching battle, the Tritons pulled off 
a double-overtime victory against the Gators.

With six seconds left in the first over-
time, junior guard Casey Ryan nailed a clutch 
three-pointer, carrying the Tritons into double 
overtime. UCSD then carried his momentum 
to seal the victory 91-86.

Four Tritons scored in the double-digits,  
senior guard Jordan Lawley leading the way 
with a season-best 31 points. Sophomore 
center Christian Hatch bested her previous 
career high, scoring 16 points and sinking 
eight of nine shots from the floor. Ryan scored 
12 points — including the last-second three 
— and senior guard Tyler Acevedo hit three 
triples in the game, finishing with 10 points. 

“Our competition level was there all 
[throughout the] game,” head coach Chris 
Carlson said. “The payoff was there — because 
we worked so hard to get to that point and 
compete at such a high level — and to have the 
win top it off was good. We improved tonight, 

and that’s a huge thing for us right now.”
After jumping out the gates to a 22-11 

start, the Tritons slowed a bit and let the 
Gators go for a 13-3 run. And at 49-47, with 
nine minutes left in the second half, the game 
was still up for grabs.

The Gators gained momentum after taking 
a 51-49 lead, but Acevedo quickly answered 
back by netting a shot from outside the arc to 
put the Tritons back on top. 

Lawley hit a crucial three-pointer to give 
the Tritons a 62-60 advantage with three 
minutes left in play. With 10 seconds to go, 
the Gators — who were down 65-68 — called 
a timeout. Soon after, San Francisco State tied 
the game 65-65, forcing an overtime period. 

“We talked yesterday about pulling togeth-
er a 40-minute game and the guys really did 
that,” said Lawley. “We all busted our butts 
out there and came out and proved that we 
wanted it.”

The Gators carried their late momentum 
into overtime, taking the lead by as much as 
76-70. Sophomore guard Jay Wey was the 
game’s unsung hero. He netted two critical 
three-pointers with one minute on the clock. 
Down 76-73 with six seconds left, Ryan seized 
the moment with a timely three-pointer to tie 
the game and force it into double overtime.

“Every single one of us on the court has 

the capability of making that shot,” Lawley 
said. “Casey didn’t really have a look, but he 
threw it up and the prayer went in, so you just 
have to be thankful for it — and we capital-
ized on it.”

The Tritons took the late momentum and 
never looked back. Lawley nailed some criti-
cal free throws down the stretch to give the 
Tritons a hard-fought 91-86 win. 

“It shows what type of competitive high we 
can reach,” Carlson said. “If we do the things 
we’ve talked about on a consistent basis, we 
can be a tough out. There are still a lot of 
things we can improve on, and that’s really 
the biggest thing we’re trying to do: maintain 
an atmosphere where everyone can improve 
individually and collectively.”

The win over the Gators followed a devas-
tating loss at RIMAC Arena against Cal State 
Monterey Bay last Thursday, Jan. 14. Trailing 
by as many as 12 points, UCSD came back to 
take a 55-53 lead with five minutes left to play. 
However, the men were unable to complete 
their comeback bid, and lost 62-66. 

UCSD is back on the road next week to 
take on the Humboldt State Lumberjacks on 
Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

SWIMMING & DIVING — After 
competing in two meets last week-
end, the UCSD women’s swim team 
defeated Division-I crosstown rival 
University of San Diego for the ninth 
time in a row on Saturday, Jan. 16. The 
Tritons took 11 of the 16 events in close 
calls and touch-out wins.

In the end, the Tritons defeated 
the Toreros 168.5-130.5 at Canyonview 
Pool this past weekend. Senior captain 
Cari Cunningham looks forward to 
improving times before the conference 
championship meet next February.

“The girls were really pumped 
before the meet,” Cunningham said. 
“We had eight straight victories, and 
we really wanted to make it nine. I 
really wanted to finish undefeated 
against them in my senior year. You 
could see it in our swimming — we 
just wanted it.”

In light of the dive meet results 
from Thursday, Jan. 14, Junior captain 
Anju Shimura stressed the importance 
of a strong start.

“We came into the meet 26 points 
behind after the dive meet Thursday,” 
Shimura said. “We definitely caught 
up quickly with all the relays in the 
first event.”

The day began with a half-second 
win for the UCSD 200-yard medley 
relay team — Shimura, sophomore 
Mercedes O’Brien, junior Jessica 
Ferguson and freshman Katherine 
Tse — with a time of 1:48.11.

Sophomore Alex Henley led the 
Tritons by winning the 200-yard free-
style (1:52.89), the 200-yard back-
stroke (2:04.45) and the 200-yard 
individual medley (2:09.13).

Shimura (100-yard freestyle, 100-
yard backstroke) and freshman Beth 
Dong (500-yard freestyle, 1,000-yard 
freestyle) both won two events for 
the Tritons. 

“We started off the meet really 
strong,” Cunningham said. “It was defi-
nitely what we needed to get going.”

Both teams fought bitterly for 
advantage in a close race, with winners 
edging ahead by mere hundredths of 
seconds on several occasions.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — As the UCSD
