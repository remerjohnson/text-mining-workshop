cancel the engagement at the 
City Club, Peterson remarked , 
"We Just weren't in any mood to 
renegotiate ... no more Mr. Nice 
Guy."

Batzel said a decision on 
whether more land would be

New 'AS constitution 
raises old grievances 
By ELLEN CAPRIO, Sraff Wnter 

Despite allegations that the 
new ASUCSD constitution was 
illegally adopted last wimer, 
Associated Students' 
representatives say the 
constitution met the legal 
requirements for approval. 

"The new co nstitution is 
completely illegal." Jelger Kalmijn 
of th e Student Cooperative 
Union (SCU) said. "The remedy 
is a constitutional convention to 
work out fair resolutions," he 
said . 

These charges of an illegal 
adoption of the constitution on 
the basis of insufficient voter 
turnout, were labelled 
"inaccurate" by current AS 
President Mary Rose Alexander. 
"The constitUtion required a 2/3 
approval of those who voted. Of 
the 6 pere ent voter turnout, 80 

percent approved of It." 
Alexander said. 

Kalmijn quoted Student Body 
Advisor Randy Woodard in a 
recent letter to Chancellor 
Ric hard Atkinson as calling the 
new cons titution an 
"ammendment." 

'The changes in the model of 
governance and philosophy ... 
should have been presented to 
the student body as an 
alternative to the then-existing· 
model of governance," Kalmijn 
wrote. 

Mark Boroditsky, student body 
presidem for the '84-'85 school 
year, said that the winter 
referendum was designed so that 
students could vote on a new 
constitution, based on a two-year 
constitutional convention.

"No matter how hard we try, 
we're never going to compre hend 
it ," concluded a UC Santa Cruz 
student. 

"It 's a process. It just has to 
keep developing and 
expanding," a Polish participant 
said matte r-of-factly. 

The students themselves dId 
not cons ider their attitude 
disillusioned or pessimIstic. They 
were "just trying to be realisitlc ." 

Growing up in a world with 
nuclear weapons, the students 
thought th e problem seemed too 
big to tackle . Many had diffIculty 
belieVIng that the arms race 
could ever be stopped, It was 
simply another part of life in the 
world today, wasn 't it? 

Seminar organizers and 
lecturers sat back in their chairs 
and took a deep breath. They 
knew they had their work cut 
out for lhem. During the next 10 
days , it would be their job to 
ope n the minds and mouths of 
these students and encourage 
new thinking and new dialogues 
on how to end the nuclear arms 
race. 

"Remember," they pointed out 
to the students several umes, "we 
ended slavery and that seemed 
pretty impossible in those days 
too ." 

These s tudents, professors and 
nuclear arms experts were 
gathered tOgether during the first 
twO weeks of April, at the 
invitation of the University of 
California, to exchange ideas 
with one another and approac h

the problem of the arms race 
from an international leveL 

The seminar, tided "The 
Nuclear Arms Race - An 
American/ European Dialogue ," 
co ns isted of 39 students and 
nine lecturers [rom the United 
Sta teS, East and West Europe 
and J apan. Students were 
awarded a $300 stipend to 
partici pate based on their 
knowledge and interest in the 
subject 

For 10 days , students attended a 
series of mornIng lectures, which 
Int roduced a bnef hIStOry of war in 
the world , traced the development 
of nuclear weapons and arms 
control negotiations and ended 
with several proposals to end the 
arms race. 

After splitti ng into two groups 
to discuss what they heard in 
the morning, students returned 
after lunch to an afternoon 
session in which they could 
questi on the lectueres on their 
theories. 

A highlight of the program was 
an intenational relations 
simulation in which small groups 
of students, representi ng the 
United States, USSR, China India 
and Pakistan , were fo rced to deal 
with Pakistan's mock threat to 
explode its first atomic bomb. 

Sitting atte ntively through hour 
after h our of lectures and panel 
discussions, students were 
virtually bombarded wi th 
information about the arms race . 
During the intensive program, 
students heard about tOpiCS 

ranging from nuclear winter to 
SALT II , from mutually assu red 
destruction to NATO bases in 
Europe . 

Education Abroad Program 
director William Allaway, who 
has helped organ ize the seminar 
for three years, appropriately 
described how the students felt 
after the course: "I've learned 
more about the nuclear arms race 
than I ever wanted to know." 

Allaway said the seminar was 
"baSIcally a consciousness-raising 
effort. We want to give both 
European and UC students the 
opportunity to share their 
thinking in a structured way 
about the nuclear arms race and 
get away from the 'wall SCrIbbling 
dialogue' (graffiti)." 

According to students, this 
"co nsciousness-raisi ng effo rt" was 
a success. Though many students 
mentioned that the "overdose" of 
facts, theories and treaties 
sometimes sent their heads 
reeling with in formation, by the 
end of the seminar organ izers 
seemed to have accomplished 
their task of helping students 
overcome their felings of 
hopelessness. 

"This seminar has Increased 
my interest five or six times. I 
don 't know exactly what I'm 
going to do , but I'm going to do 
someth ing," said UC San Diego 
anthropology major Maura Visser, 
who added she had not had an 
extensive involvement in the 
issue before the course. 1m

Editor: 

President Reagan has 
persistently accused big 
government of being a 
hinderance, as opposed to a 
helpmate, in enhancing the 
economic well-being of 
Americans. 

Indeed, since his election in 
1980 - and beyond - Reagan 
has campaigned , chortled , 
harrangued, even threatened 
Congress to get government 01T 
the backs of his people. So, isn't 
it sadistically ironic that the 
president and his administration 
are directing the powerful OlTice 
of Management and Budget to 
oversee the extension of the 
long, evil arm of government into 
the most private areas of our 
lives? 

At this moment, OMB, under 
the pretense of ferreting out 
abysmal amounts of waste, fraud 
and abuse in social service 
agencies rather than in the 
Pentagon , is forcing the states to 
streamline the computerization 
of reams of highly personal data 
collected from their citizens. The 
Reagan Administration steadfastly 
denies that its intent is to 
establish a master computer 
system so that faceless 
government officials among 
selected agencies will have 
almost unlimited ac('p~~ to the 
financial and personal files of 
vinually every American. 

But because OMB's orders, 
published February 28, require

BEHIND every leftist national liberation !Tlovement from icaragua

American right sees the dark 
hand of the Soviet Union . While 
this is quite a compliment, it is 
an undeserved one. 

As Charles de Gaulle said 20 
years ago, the Soviet Union has 
long ago ceased to be a 
revolutionary power but instead 
has become a conventional one 
which seeks influence and 
advantage in conventional ways. 
Of course this has not always 
been the case .

revolution , were dedicated

their reign . However, out of the 
extreme scarcity cuased by the 
Russian civil war arose a 
bureaucratic caste which saw its

movement but in protecting its 
own leges. With the goal of 

these pnvileges In 
bureaucracy's primary 

(as now) was not to 
undermine the 

West but to 

make peace with it. 
This bureaucracy (represented 

by Stalin) ousted the Trotskyists 
and ascended to unchallenged 
power in the late 1920s. Under 
Stalin the Communist 
International ceased to be a 
revolutionary force and became 
instead an arm of the USSR's 
foreign policy. The International's 
new purpose was not to assist 
communist revolutions (as it had 
been under Lenin) but to relax 
Western pressure upon the USSR 
and thus solidify the position of 
the Stalinist bureaucracy. As the 
party line changed from "world 
revolution" to "socialism in one 
country: this policy led to 
countless criminal betrayals of 
the leftist cause . Soviet foreign 
policy was no more revolutionary 
or communistic than the USSR 
was a workers democracy. 
Herein lies one essential element 
of the betrayal of the Russian 
revolution. 

In 1927 the Chinese 
Communists, under the guidance 
of the USSR, were ready to make 
a bid for power against the pro-
Western regime of Chalng Kai-
Shek. On the eve of the Soviet 
planned insurrection , a last 
minute Instruction came from 
Moscow ordering the 
Communists to bury their 

weapons, dissolve their army and 
form a coaltion government wim 
Chaing. 

This order was tantamount to 
suicide. The necessary arms did 
not come and the revolutionaries' 
careful planning was destroyed. 
The uprising was smashed, and 
tens of thousands of 
Communists died at the hands 
of Chiang's army. The Chinese 
Communists did not finally gain 
power until 22 years later; their 
victory was against the wishes of 
the U.sSR, who preferred a 
dtvlded (and thus weakened) 
China . 

In 1933 the German 
Communists, on the verge of 
setzing power and trusting 
implicitly in Stalin 's leadership, 
were dealt a similar blow. 
Pursuing the same 
collaborationi st poltcy the 
Communists were decimated and 
their members murdered en . 
masse. 

In 1936, the powerful, Soviet 
controlled Spa nish Communi st 
Pany did everything in ItS power 
to wrest control from a 
radicahzed working class and 
hand it over to a moderate 
refonnist middle-class. As Bnrish 
socialist eorge Orwell bitterly 
noted In hiS book HOl1lage to 
CatalOnia , the Communists 

destroyed socialism in Spain 
long before General Franco had 
a cnance to. 

Desperately in need of time to 
rebuild his army and despairing 
of his unsuccessful attempts to 
conclude an anti-fascist alliance 
with Britain and France, in 1939 
Stalin signed a non-agression 
pact with Hitler. 

Soviet foreign policy cominued 
on in this same fashion after the 
war. Stalin ordered the 
Communist dominated anti-Nazi 
resistence groups in France and 
Italy - the only armed and 
popularly supported groups in 
those countries - to disarm and 
collaborate with the American 
and British occupying armies. 

Rather than making a 
potentially successful bid for 
power they bOth did what 
Moscow ordered and so lost 
almost all their power, becoming 
merely left-wing pseudo-sociali st 
parties in capitali st governments. 

Leftist guerillas dCfeated a 
bougeois army in Bolivia in 1952 
only to turn power over to a 
reformist capitalist regime which 
quickly abandoned their leftist 
program. 

lraqui Communi sts were on 
the verge of seizi ng power in 
1958, but on Khrushchev's 
orders they collaborated with 

General Qassem's reformist 
military regimes. Just months 
later these same Communists 
who helped Qassem to power 
were rewarded with 'nass 
imprisonment and execution . 

In 1979 the powerful pro-
Moscow Tudeh pany followed 
Breshnev's d ictum and supported 
the Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic 
revolution . Within weeks the 
same communists who helped the 
Imam to power were executed in 
droves. 

The list of betrayal goes much 
funher and it is important to 
remember that these examples 
are not exceptions but are 
instead typical. Even from this 
panial look we can see that 
Soviet foreign policy, far from 
being so devious and clever as 
we all assume it to be, has been 
merely opportunistic and stupid . 

Of course, all of the above has 
been and continues to be 
comple tely los t upon the 
American right. Indeed , on this 
point feverish American Cold 
Warriors , with their never-
ending talrs of blood red armed 
and fillanced world revolution , 
are even more wildly wrong than 
usual. ~

North America. Nevenheless, 
they have met with litde success. 

Given the trend of ignoring 
other'S miseries once having 
attained a steady diet of 
securities, it is likely that the 
North American who ignores the 
malnutritious transient in 
Mission Beach will easily dismiSS 
the bloated infants in South 
Africa's Bantustanns. 

But fret not, defenders of 
humanitarianism, the puppets of 
the interantional canels and 
corporations are bunghng their 
agendas at an increased rate 
these days. We need to look no 
further than [he White House to 
see how the policy of 
"constructive engagement" with 
the white minority government 
in South Africa has failed both 
the puppeteers, (such as the 
corporate giants who dress-up as 
UC Regents) and their most 

This is no mean feat for the 
South African military. They have 
conducted many search and 
destroy mIssions in every 
country in Southern Africa since 
the ANC decided in 1959 that it 
was in the best interests of the 
black population in their 
homeland to abandon the 
suicidal strategy of purely 
peaceful negotiation with the 
apanheid regime. 

There is no bargaining with 

Botha would like to dupe the 
world into believing that his 
regime is acting in "self-defense" 
against bloodthirsty 
internationalists. Of course we 
know the stifled truth - that 
neo-colonialist regimes almost 
always call national liberation 
struggles acts of fanatical 
terrorism. 

As material conditions worsen 
daily in South Africa, so does the 
line of argument presented by 
the UC Regents. Empirical 
evidence tells us that this 
ignorant type of altruism is false . 
From a purely economic 
standpoint, the most succcessful 

negotiate for a peaceful transition _ 
to a non-racist democracy is to 
economically and politically 
isolate them on an international 
scale. 

The continuance of the 
divestment campaign here at 
UCSD and nationwide is a 
mandatory step in that direction . 
As the value of the rand 
continues to fall and the 
multinational corporations can 
no longer suppon the apanheid 
state, the day of reckoning for 
those who starve the starving, 
and keep the food out of the 
mouths of hungry infants will 
hasten. IW

Feature on: 
Sandra Cervantes 

Sandra Cervantes, the new 
receptionist in the Resident 
Dean's Office, is very pleased 
with her new job. Although she is 
kept very busy with answering 
the telephone , giving out 
information , and many other 
tasks, she says, "I really like the 
work that I do, and I feel very 
comfortable working with Judith , 
Jane, Tim, Virginia and all the 
RA '5. I also like meeting and 
getting to know all of tbe 
interesting people that come into 
the Resident Dean's Office." 

Born and raised in Mexico, 
Sandra moved to California in 
1975, and now resides in San 

Ysidro . When a friend of hers 
told her that there was an 
opening for a position in the 
Revelle Resident Dean's Office, 
she "rushed right over and 
applied." When she isn't working 
Sandra goes to Southwestern 
Junior College , where she has 
been going for five years . She is 
presently taking general 
education classes, such as 
philosophy , and would 
eventually like to receive a degree 
that would enable her to become 
involved in bilingual education. 

When she isn't working at the 
Resident Dean's Office, or going 
to school , Sandra enJoys 
shopping, swimming, reading, 
and spending time with her 
fian ce, who she plans on 
manying sometime this year. 

Well, the year is almoSt over and this is the last time I'll be writing 
you from RCC Comer. Overall, it's been a good year and I've really 
enjoyed being a part of Revelle College Council. 

Although it's already the eighth week, things will still be happening 
at Revelle. We'll be finishing up by honoring student participants in 
Revelle Government at our annual leadership banquet next Friday, the 
four college councils, in conjunction with Revelle Noon Programming 
Board, will be honoring graduating seniors with a "Senior Send-OIT." 

Not only is Sandra very pleased 
with her position as receptionist, 
Judith Edwin , Resident Dean, 
and Jane MacDonald and Tim 
Purpora , Assistant Resident 
Deans are also very pleased with 
her performance. Jane remarked:' 
"Sandra is the only person in this 
office who can do l5 things all at 
once, do them wen , and ·still be 
cheerful!" Tim commented , 
·Sandra is great, and her cousin 
makes great tamales!" As for the 
Resident Advisors, and the 
general student resident 
population, the general 
consensus is that "Sandra is a 
great person and a lot of fun !" 

As for next year, six very quahfied people have juS( been elected to 
serve on next year's RCC. I urge you to keep posted on what they will 
be doing next year. " I expect a lot of good things to come!

• Seven automobiles were 
broken into and burglarized. 
• Two motorcycles were stolen. 
• A light-bar from the tOp of a 
police automobile was stolen. 
Sergeant Jones of the UCSD 
police department hopes that the 
bar, which is valued at $800, will 
"miraculously appear before 
somebody has to go to jail. We 
always find them, th e)' usually

• A couple of obscene phone 
calls have been made in the past 
several weeks. According to 
Jones, this problem is not "as 
rampant as it was last year." 
Hwever, Jones does feel that the 
calls, which have been 
conducted recently. are by the 
same person who has done this 
in previous years. 

The caller has a certain 
"scam." He calls up his victims, 
presenting himself as an officer 
from either the campus police, 
San Diego police or [he sheriffs 
department. He tells his victims 
that they are the next target of 
an obscene phone caller and 
asks them to cooperate with him' 
by keeping the calle r on the line 
while he traces it. Then he hangs 
up, calls back and masturbates. 

The police are asking that 
anybody who receives such a 
phone caU to quickly caU the 
department to verify the origins 
of the telephone call. 
• Another scam occurring on 
campus is the theft of purses 
and wallets. Apparently, the 
crook walks into empty offices 
'around campus and opens the 
bottom desk drawer of 
secretaries' desks, where purses 
are often kept. and takes their 
wallets. 

U uall), the thief carries a set 
of keys with him so that, in case 
he is caught, he can jLlSt say he 
found the keys and was looking 
for some paper to write a note 
and leave them on the desk.

request was reviewed , but it 
wasn't grounds to dissolve the

The low voter turnout for the 
winter referendum, which 
adopted the new AS constitution , 
was not because of lack of

Alexander said . -People didn't 
see it (the new constitution) as

recruiter in Revelle Plaza. The paint 
symbolized the blood of Libyans 
injured and killed in the u.s. air 
raids on the country, and the 
cadet, in full army uniform, was 
seen by the protestor as a 
representative of that military . 
action. 

I t was the first incident 
involving the ROTC on this 
campus since the 70s, which 
ha.; brought this small faction of 
students, who had gone relatively 
unnoticed for so long, into the 
spotlight. 

The ROTC used to cany with 
it images of milit2ris[lc , right-
wing students who were 
vehement anti-communists and 
altruistic patriots. Bur now that 
the times of the Viemam war 
have become lessons in history, 
students' attitudes toward the 
ROTC have changed. Today it 
means guaranteed jobs after 
graduation , a way to pay for 
tuition and books, and a chance 
to suppOrt their country. 

The number o f UCSD students 
in the Reserve Officers' Training 
Corps (ROTC) has tripled since 
1981 , with more than 50 in aD 
three branches; Army, Air Force 
and Navy. 

"It's a good wa y to go if you 
want to serve you country, eam 
money and get some good job 
experience," said Robert Bayer, a 
senior majoring in applied math 
in the Navy ROTC. 

There are no ROTC courses 
offered here on campus and all 
UCSD students in the program 
are forced to do all their training 
at either San Diego State 
University or the University of 
San Diego. Most of the cadets 
feel the hassle of commuting is 
well worth it. 

Bayer said he ortginally joined 
the program three years ago 
because he needed a way to pay 
for school. He tried working 25 
hours a week during his 
freshman year, but said it cut too 
much into his study time. 

"I figured I was running out of 
money, so I applied for an ROTC 
scholarship ," Bayer said , adding 
that his training only takes up 

ten hours of his week. "Now that 
I'm in, I like it so much that I 
might"stay in the Navy fo r a 
while. 

After students graduate from 
college and finish their ROTC 
training, they all become olTicers 
in their respective branches and 
are required to serve up to eight 
years of military duty. The Navy 
and Air Force cadets must spend 
at least three years in the active 
military and are allowed to serve 
the rest of their time the 
reserves , while the Army cadets 
have the option of serving their 
eight years on active duty, in the 
reserves or in the national guard. 

Scholarships, which pay for 
tuition , books and a $100 a 

SDSU. "People need jobs, and all 
of these kids are going to have 
one right out of college." 

A new romantiCism of the 
military has emerged over the 
past few years and can be seen 
in everything fro m children's 
cartoons to movies like Rambo, 
An Officer and a Gentleman and 
the newly released Top Gun. 
"Stuff Ii ke Rambo is a bit 
outlandish for me," admits Army 
Cadet Dave Gemlich, who credits 
the trend to the new Reagan era. 
"But it's nice to see that the 
military is regaining some of its 
past respect in other ways." 

After being a student at UCSD 
for the past four years, Gemlich 
feels that the campus has been 
branded with a false label of 

"If students are 
interested in ROTC, why 
would the university not 
facilitate it just as it would 
any other academic 
program?" 

- Joseph Watson 

month subsistence lee, are 
granted only to those students 
who excel in their academics as 
well as in their officer training 
courses. "These people are the 
cream of the crop grade-wise ," 
according to Lieutenant K.M. 
Hobbs, a professor of naval 
science at USD. "If you can get 
the Navy to fund your education 
and go to a prestigious school -
why not join the ROTC?" 

Most of the ROTC staff 
members agree that the new 
conservative trend among teday's 
college students is the main 
reason behind the program's 
recent surge in popularity. 

"People are looking at career 
opponunities and not personal 
involvement in issues," said 
Major David Maninelli , a faculty 
member of the Army ROTC at 

being anti-conservative and anti-
Reagan . "I think more people are 
in favor of the ROTC than one 
would suspect; it's JUSt that the 
organized opposition is more 
vocal - that 's why this college 
appears so liberal," he said. "Sut 
even so, I stiD don 't think this 
type of school could tolerate 
having ROTC on campus." 

The idea of establishing an 
ROTC program at UCSD is n'or a 
new one , and the administration 
has been approached several 
times by all three branches, that 
have shown interest in setting up 
their camps at the univerSity. 
Chancellor Atkinson has met 
with the Army 's ROTC officers 
numerous times and as the 
populariry of the program 
increases, so does the plausibility 
of bringing it on campus. 

"If UCSD students are 

intersted in ROTC, why would 
the University not facil itate it just 
as they would any other 
academic program?" said Joe 
Watson, vice chancellor of 
undergraduate affairs. "The 
students would find it more 
convenient to take class here , 
and it does provide an 
opportunity for our students [0 
enter the military as officers." 

According to Watson , the 
Academic Senate would be a 
deciding factor in the issue , 
because all faculty , eve n if they 
a re provided by the military at 
no cost UCSD, must be 
approved. ~ 

ROTC programs at UC 
Berkeley, UCLA, UCSB and UC 
Davis have all been approved by 

their campus' academic senate 
and are curently established as 
academic departments. 

According to David Crown, 
the current c hair of the 
Academic Se nate's committee on 
educational policy and courses, 
there is very little chance that 
the ROTC will become a pan of 
UCSD, at least for the time 
being. "[ would say the 
probability of establishing an 
ROTC program on this campus 
is slim - just because of the 

type of people we have at this 
university," he said . 

Students who are now taking 
military science courses at SDSU 
and USD are only allowed to 
transfer six units of their 
coursework to their UCSD 
transcript. Despite this, the 
campus' strong science and 
engineering d.epartmcnts, and 

the fact that the military will 
bend over backward's to get a 
hold of UCSD graduates, has 
proven incentive enought for 
many of the cadets to put OUt 
the extra effort . 

Emmanuel Bagnus had been 
accepted at the Naval Academy, 
but after spending a summer 
there he decided it \vasn't for 
him and came to UCSD and 
joined the naval ROTC instead. 

"UCSD gives you a lot more 
freedom ~ it's a totally different 
lifestyle ," he said. "The emphasis 
at the Naval Academy really 
strays from academic', you do so 
much other stuff that you don't 
have time to study, and I need 
time to stud y." 

Bagnus was raised in a 
milital)' family, as are many 
cadets, and was somewhat 
turned-off by the "liberal" 
atmosphere of UCSD. "I stick to 
my beliefs and take everything 
with a grain of salt," he said, but 
quickly added lhat he feels 
fortunate that he's exposed to so 
many different views, and said it 
has done him a lot of good . "I 
think some of the political 
science classes here at UCSD 
have made me less centered ." 

The recent student protest 
over U.S. involvement in Libya 
and Central America, as well as 
the vote not to have any student 
fees involved in promoting the 
military in any manner, have 
been a bit too much for some 
cadets to handle. 

"I have no respect for people 
who don 't have respect for the 
military," said Air Force cadet 
Susan Grey, who is one of the 
few women in her unit. ·We're 
not trying to Stop having the 
Cht' people on campus, and I 
don't think they should be 
running around campus saying 
bad things about the military." 

"I think it's tOO bad that UCSD 
is so liberal ," she added. Grey 
remarked that when she wears 
her uniform to school, as most 
cadets are required to do at least 
once a week, she doesn 't receive 
as much nack from the "liberals" 
as her fellow male cadets. "That's 
th e only advantage to being a 
woman in the military ," she said . 
"It's difficult , you stand out like a 
sore thumb," she adds, and 
continues, "the demands that are 

Please rum to page 9 

ROTC 
Continued from page 8 
made on me are pretty much th e 
same as arc made on the men ." 

Because women are not 
alowed in combat zones, Grey 
will not be allowed to fly fighter 
jets and mu t instead settle for 
flying cargo planes. Evene flying 
a cargo plane is tough lor a 
woman because competition 
between women pilOts is so 
fierce , she said .

"THAT OBSCURE OBJEa OF DESIRE" 

2 Hiatw May 22, 1986 

Shout to the top 
let's get right to it: Top Gun i$ the most solidly satisfying two 

hours of pure movie entertainment to grace the screen in a long, 
long time. 

It's the kind of movie that will have audiences flocking all 
summer long and will have critics smugly brushing it off as Rambo 
Meets the Right Stuff on MTV. . 

Top Gun is more than this. True it's rather empty-headed, but 
summer audiences don't exactly drool about intelligentsia. 

It is the type of "flick" critics can and will never admitto liking: 
slick and exciting, short on story, long on action and good looks. 

Tom Cruise plays Lt. Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, rumored to be 
the nation's best fighter pilot. He is also the only pilot to ever 
engage a Soviet MiG 28 in hostile manuevers. This catches the eye

Jay Leno, who appeared in 
Mandeville Auditorium twice 
last Friday night, got off to a 
slow start in the second show 
(10:00). Butthat was abo uta II 
that was slow on Friday night. 

Laughing up a storm street," he said, "they don't tell people in Sweden not to eat the vegetables." 
What was really impressive 

about Leno, was that he made 
it seem as if everything he did 
was improvised. It all flowed 
out naturally; all the thought 
patterns were smooth and 
followable . Some of it was 
obvious improvisation: he 
was talking with members of 
the audience, and the 
unrehearsed wisecracks were 
incredibly smooth and glib. 

Sure, he got off to a slow 
start, but that is understand-
able when you consider that 
he had just got off the stage 
from the first show, where he 
spent close to two hours 
pacing back and forth, 
spouting off at the mouth and 
keeping the audience in 
virtual fits of hysterics for the 
duration. 

When he opened the 
second show. no one in the 
audience really knew what to 
expect. Most people had 
probably at least heard his 
name; a lot had seen him 
guesting on David Letterman, 
and a few might have seen his 
fantastic Elvis impression 
somewhere or other. But as a 
stand-up comedian, not much 
has been seen of Jay Leno. 
People were unsure, and Jay 
didn't give them a chance to 
speculate. 

After his introduction, he 
strolled out onto the stage, 

and immediately embarked 
into his fut, :>harp, clever 
style. It took a few minutes for 
the a udience to get 
accustomed to it, and from 
then on, there was no turning 
back. 

Jay did a fine job. He 
showed no signs of fatigue, 
even after four hours of 
performing, and there were no 
lapses in the laughter. His 
method tends toward a one-
liner format, rather than the 
story-telling type, which is 
usually a little hard to keep up 
for an extended period of 
time. 

It is very rare to see a 
performer maintain this 
pitched hysteria, which 
probably accounts for the 
huge success of the best of the

story-telling comedians like 
Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. 
Story-telling comedians can 
have minor laughs for half an 
hour, building up to a climax, 
and releaSing it all at once. 
This takes pressure off both 

the comedian and the 
audience. But Leno, between 
sips of water, had people 
g;Jsping for air through most 
of the show, and loving it. 

He dappled in a lot of areas 
for topics, steering away from 
what he is "known" for. 
When someone called out 
"Elvis!" Leno merely 
dismissed the notion, saying, 
"He's still dead, so relax." 
Instead, Leno ventured into a 
lot of different areas. He had 
some original ideas about a 
topic covered by many 

comedians: the differences 
between the sexes. 

"The major difference 
between men and women," he 
said seriously, "is that men 
love the Three Stooges. Men 
think those guys are funny, 

and women think they're a 
bunch of shitheads." 

Leno did a lot of 
complaining ; sometimes 
about television (especially 
commercials), sometimes 
about politics. He expressed 
exasperation with the USSR's 
policy of denying the impact 
of the Chernobyl disaster. 

He cited one particular 
statement that the odds of a 
meltdown were less than a 
person getting hit by a car on 
the streets. "Okay, but if! get 
hit by a truck crossing the 

Once, when he went to take 
a sip of water, someone from 
the back of the audience 
shouted something unintell-
igible. Jay looked up and said, 
"What? What was that? Please 
repeat it, sir." 

"Gahh , gloob a runa 
wuumbat!" the person 
roared , or something very 
close. No one could make it 
out . Jay leaned down 
confidingly to the front 
section, shaking his head. 
"Now I wonder why I couldn't 
understand that?" he asked 
resignedly. 

It was a thoroughly 
enjoyable show, and you left 
Mandeville in awe.

FTance.sco T orrel, one of the 
major political artists of 
today, will be installing his 
new work, "The Dictatorship 
of Swiftness," as part of the 
"Exhibition Parameters" 
series at the La Jolla Museum 
of Modern Art. In the 
production Torres uses a 
unique combination of media 
to examine the element of 

speed in ontemporary 
culture, particularly in 
warfare . The installation 
consists of six video monitors 
set in an arc around a weapon. 
The artist finds this work a 
reflection of the "relationship 
between power and speed; 
SQCial power and the ability to 
implement it in the swiftest 
manner to ensure success; 
speed as a necessity to gather 
information, develop 
products, find markets, outdo 
competitors, offset political 
moves and, when imperative, 
win wars. " Torres, originally 
from Barcelona, Spain, has 
lived in New York City since 
1974. His work has been seen 
in the U.S., Europe, Australia 
and New Zealand. tiThe 
Dictatorship of Swiftness"
