CI 22: A 
class study 
in role 
reversals 
Class filmed 
for the NBC 
Nightly News 

By LISA QUINTANA 
St.g W,itn 

Last Wednesday a team from 
the "NBC Nightly News" was on 
campus here at UC San Diego. 
They were not filming a student 
riot, a speech by an ex-president, 
or even the construction of the 
new Price Center. Rather, they 
were here to cover Contempor-
ary Issues 22, a class on human 
sexuality, and an experiment in 
role reversal. 

Leading the experiment was 
guest lecturer Dr. Warren Far-
rell, who has performed this 
experiment for the course for 
four years. Dr. Farrell is no 
stranger to the cameras. He has 
appeared on "Donahue" eight 
times and on "Good Morning, 
America," "The Today Show," 
and "The CBS Morning News," 
among others. In the last 20 
years, he has been a part of over 
600 women's and men's groups 
and has been named to the board 
ofthe National Organization For 
Women in New York City three 
times. Farrell is the author of 
two books: "The Liberated 
Man," and "Why Men Are The 
Way They Are ... His most recent, 
this latter work was released in 
1986. Farrell also teaches a 
course at the UCSO School of 
Medicine with the same title. He 
became interested in working 
with men and women almost 20 
years ago when he first attemp-
ted to explain the Women's 
Movement to men. 

The purpose of his books and 
teachings, Dr. Farrell said, is to 
"promote understanding between 
women and men." According to 
Farrell, each sex has both a kind 
of power and powerlessness. He 
maintained that it is a myth that 
"for several thousand years only 
women ha ve suffered under sex-
ism." He asserted that "both men 
and women have suffered under 
sexism for thousands of years." 
In order to grasp Farrell's rather 
controversial tenets, one must 
understand his belief that society 
has conditioned women to raise 
the children, and men to raise the 
money. Women have few options

Proposed site for

new aquarl~m 
may tie unstable 
By JAMES GILMORE 
Sttdj W,ltn 

Routine soil tests taken in late 
November have revealed a poten-
tially unstable geological con-
dition at the proposed site of the 
new Stephen Birch Aquarium-
Museum at UCSO's Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
which threatens to increase the 
cost by $1 million and delay con-
struction by at least six months. 

Apparently, the site of the 
planned $8.2 million aquarium-
museum, a wooded knoll east of 
La Jolla Shores Drive overlook-
ing the SIO campus with a view 
of the La Jolla coast, sits atop a 
"slip plane," a layer of slippery 
clay formed when the knoll slid 
down from the mesa an esti-
mated 120,000 years ago. 

"This development is regret-
table," said Chancellor Richard 
C. Atkinson, "but the aquarium-
museum at Scripps remains one 
of UCSO's highest priorities. We 
intend to proceed as quickly as 
possible to minimize any delay in 
completion of the project." 

Architectural work on the new 
facility has been temporarily 
suspended by Scripps officials 
until geologists can determine 
what measures can be taken to 
stabilize the site, or if an alter-
native site will have to be cons i-

dered. According to Tom Col-
lins, the associate director of 
Scripps, an evaluation of the 
findings will be made some time 
late this month . 

Scripps officials are currently 
considering three potential miti-
gating measures to stabilize the 
site. By bulldozing out loo feet 
of the west side of the hill, then 
recompacting it with the same 
soil, an earthen dam can be 
formed to buttress the hill. Also, 
a series of small diameter holes 
can be drilled into the site at 10-
foot intervals forming a matrix 
into which a chemical can be 
injected to strengthen the compo-
sition of the slippery layer of 
clay. Or, a series of large diame-
ter holes with branches radiating 
out from their bases can be drilled 
at I oo-foot intervals and filled 
with concrete to form a skeletal 
support structure. . 

If they choose not to build on 
the present site, Scripps planners 
have an alternative site they may 
develop 600 feet to the north. 
According to Collins, although 
the alternative site is not as desir-
able as the present site, Scripps' 
primary concern is to ensure the 
safety of visitors and employees. 
"The aquarium-museum owes its 
uniqueness and public appeal as 
an educational organization to

By ELAINE SMOLER 
Staff W,ile, 

At the A S. Council meet ing 
last Wednesday night , three new 
freshman senators were installed . 

Amy Vanderlinden is the new 
freshman senatorfrom Muir Col-
lege . She is on the C. E.P. ub-
committee for undergraduate 
cour e . " 1 wanted to get my foot 
in the door on the A.S.," Vander-
linden said . 

Meredith Knobler , from Re-
velle College, is also a new sena-
tor. She wanted to be a senator 
because, "I was involved [in stu-
dent government] in high school. 
I had such a good time." 

Gayatri Gunasekaran is the 
new freshman senator from Third 
College. She was unavailable for 
comment. 

A new Warren senator has not 
been chosen yet , but will be 
announced this week . The 
Warren senator will take office 
the third week. 

The individual college coun-
cils chose their new freshman 
senators, who will hold office 
through the fall 1988 quarter.

Sodium 
not so bad, 
after all 
By ROBERT SANDERS 

SAN FRANCISCO - Has 
sodium gotten a bum rap? For 
years the public has been advised 
to cut back on all forms of 
sodium, not just table salt , or 
sodium chloride. to decrease or 
even prevent high blood pressure. 

This advice is given despite no 
real evidence that sources of sodium 
other than table salt contribute 
to chronic high blood pressure, 
or hypertension, according to 
Dr. R. Curtis Morris, Jr., pro-
fessor of medicine and director 
of UC San Francisco's General

Deukmajian proposes 52.04 
billion allottment to UCs 

Governor Deukmajian's 1988-89 
budget proposal for the state has allotted 
$2.04 billion in operating funds for the 
Univer ity of California, an increase of 
7 percent over the 1987-88 general fund 
budget , plu $18.5 million in capital 
funding. 

Included in the Governor's package is 
full funding for projected enrollment 
growth of 2.910 undergraduate and 
695 graduate students, plus money to 
meet expected increases in fixed costs, 
salary increases for faculty and staff, 
and maintenance funding for new space. 

University President David P . 
Gardner characterized the proposal as 
"a budget that maintains our momentum 
of recent years while allowing for some 
modest improvements. Most important-
ly, it sustains our progress in the critical 
areas of construction and renovation of 
facilities. for which we are extremely 
grateful. " 

Gardner said the Governor has 
provided funding for the university'S 
highest priorities, including the mainten-
ance of competitive faculty salaries. It 
proposes a 3 percent increase beginning 
Jan. I, 1989, in addition to providing 
full-year funding for a 5.7 percent 
increase that was effective this January 
I. 

Staff salaries would be consistent 
with those being proposed for state 
employees - a 5 percent increase on 
January I, 1989. 

Included in the Governor's proposal 
is the 4.4 percent st udent fee increase 
proposed in the Regents' budget, 
consistent with a state law regulating fee -
increases a pa sed in 1985. The new 
fees would be a bout $60 higher per 
student than this year, totaling about 
$1 ,434 annually. Also underthe Gover-
nor' plan, non-resident tuition would 
increase by 5 percent , to $4,506 a year. 

Capital funds would be used to 
construct facilities for social science 
program at Davi , chemistry and 

biological sciences at UCLA, animal 
Icare at Berkeley. a science library and 
academic space for College Eight at 
Santa Cruz. and an expan ion of the 
Northern California Regional Library 
Facility in Richmond . 

Major renovations projects are sche-
duled for engineering, chemistry and 
computer science programs at San 
Diego; natural science programs at 
Santa Cruz; agriculture science pro-
grams at Davis, and seismic afety 
corrections at Berkeley. 

Fund would also support planning 
for new buildings for earth and marine 
science programs at Santa Cruz, chemist-
ry and biology at San Diego , engineering 
at Davis, and a consolidated science 
library at Irvine . 

And design of new or renovated facili-
tie would be upported for biological 
sciences programs at Berkeley, physical 
sciences at Santa Barbara, engineering 
at UCLA, biological sciences at Irvine, 
the central library at San Diego, and 
teaching laboratories and eismic safety 
correction at San Diego's Undergradu-
ate Sciences Building. 

IGCC Director Herb York 
published new book 

Herbert York, director of the In titute 
of Global Conflict and Cooperation 
headquartered at UCSD, gives an 
insider'S account of the politics and 
problems of the nuclear arm race in his 
new book, "Making Weapon, Talking 
Peace" (Basic Books, 1987). 

His involvement with nuc~ar weapons 
began when he joined the Manhattan 
Project to build the first atomic bomb in 
the 1940s as a 21-year-old phys ics 
gradute from the University of Roches-
ter. As part of a team of scientists, first 
in Berkeley, California', and later at Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee, and Los Alamos, 
New Mexico , York was a colleague of 
some of the pioneers of the atomic age--
Enrico Fermi , Edward Teller, E.O. 
Lawrence , and Robert Oppenheimer. 

I n hi book. York recalls the excite-
ment he felt as an idealistic young 
researcher working on a weapon he 
correctly believed would hasten the end 
of World War II. He and many others 
assumed the atomic bomb would mean 
thc end of war altogether, since its 
power was so terrible no nation would 
risk using it. 

"Later, I came 10 be aware of the fact 
that that notion had come up in history 
repeatedly and had been proven to be 
false," York said. "After first believing 
tha t we had made wa r obsolete, I tended 
to move away from that view, .but in 
later years I've moved back toward it, at 
least in part ." 

York rose through the ranks holding 
high-level government positions con-
cerned with science, tochnology and 
defense under the Truman, Eisenhower. 
Kennedy, Johnson and Carter admini-
strations. 

In 1952 he initiated and directed the 
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a post 
he held until 1958. Under Eisenhower 
he was named the first Director of 
Defense Research and Engineering. 
Carter appointed him ambassador to 
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty negotiations with the Soviet 
Union. He was also the first Chancellor 
of UCSD, serving from 1961-1964, 

York has served on a variety of 
scientific advisory committees including 
the Presidential Science Advisory 
Committee in 1957-58 and again from 
1964-68. 

Since 1973 he has been director of the 
Program on Science, Technology and 
Public Affairs at UCSD. In 1983, he 
was appointed to head the I nstitute on 
Global Conflict and Cooperation, a 
statewide unit of the University of 
California, headquartered at UCSD. 

He is the author of two previous 
books: "Race to Oblivion" (Simon & 
Schuster, 1970), and "The Advisors: 
Oppenheimer , Teller and th~. Super- II 
bomb," (W.H . Freeman, 1973).

Talk on memory to be 
presented at UCSD 

Larry R. Squire, Ph.D., professor of 
psychiatry at the UCSD School of 
MediciRe and research career scientist 
at the Veterans Administration Medical 
Center in La Jolla , will present 
"Memory: Functional Organization of 
Neural Systems," the second of the 
school's 1987-88· Distinguished Faculty 
Lecture.Series ort Thursday, Jan. 14, at 
4:30 pm. 

The lecture will be given in Liebow 
Auditorium (Room 2100) in the Basic 
Science Building on the School of 
Medicine campus. A reception will 
follow in the Dean's Office Lobby. The 
lecture will be simulcast to Hillcrest in 
the UCSD Medical Center, Auditorium. 

Squire, an internationally recognized 
neuroscientist, has worked extensively 
on the topic of memory from the 
perspective of neuroscience and psych-
ology. He received his B.A. in psych-
ology from Oberlin College in 1963 and 
his doctorate in psychology from the 
Massachusetts Institute oj Technology 
in 1968. 

Squire joined the faculty of UCSD in 
1970. In 1973 he joined the staff of the 
VAMCand in 1980 he was appointed to 
the prestigious position of career re-
search scjentist. 

He is regarded as a leading authority 
in research with amnesic patients . 
Studies by Squire and other researchers 
have provided evidence for the existence 
of two or more separate memory systems 
in the brain, for consolidation processes 
that continue for years after original 
learning and for a critical role of the 
hippocampus in memory functions.

Erik Basil was selected as one of three finalists for the position of 
Student Regent.

N~tfI. EtBto, 

A UCSD student was chosen 
last Saturday by the U C Student 
Association as one of three final-
ists for the position of Student 
Regent. 

Erik Basil, a fourth-year senior 
majoring in political science, will 
be interviewed this Friday by the 
UC Regents along with the other 
finalists, Sumi Kae Cho (a Berke-
ley graduate student), and 
Deborah Ruth Thorpe (a Davis 
undergraduate). The Regents will 
select the new Student Regent 
the following Monday. 

Inan interview yesterday, Basil 
described why he has pursued 
the position of Student Regent. 
"I got involved because I'm 
already involved in student 
government as an employee rela-
tions coordinator [for the UCSA] 
... Student Regent is the ulti-
mate position for representing 

student needs," Basil said. 
He said that while he does not 

have any specific goals as yet, 
there are some general areas 
where he would like to encour-
age progress, including changing 
the demographic content of the 
university and improving T .A. 
training. 

"In the university'S charter [it 
says that the number of] students 
and faculty should reflect the 
demographic content of the state. 
The university does not do that," 
Basil said. 

The Regents sit on a number 
of subcommittees, and Basil 
named the subcommittee on 
educational policy as one that 
"the inherent quality of having a 
Student Regent can best be 
realized . " 

Basil defined the role of the 
Student Regent as making "sure 
that [issues] are being dealt with 
in a responsible manner." @]

its association with a great scien-
tific institution," said Aquarium 
Director Donald Wilkie. "This 
will not be affected by a change 
in the site." 

Collins estimates that any miti-
gation will cost an additional $1 
million, and would delay the 
opening of the new facility by six 
months . With this consideration, 
he projects the new aquarium-
museum will be open in the fall 
of 1990. 

The new aquarium-museum 
will replace the aging facility 
built in 1950, providing Scripps 
with over Iwice the square foot-
age to present oceanographic 
objects and display the nature of 
it research to the public, Wilkie 
aid . Where the presenl facility is 

equipped with tanks too small to 

create realistic natural habitats , 
the largest being 2.200 gallons, 
the future aquarium's largest 
50,000-gallon tank will house a 
kelp bed habitat and a realistic 
representation of its sea-life 
community, 

Many UCSD students work at 
the present facility ' ~ i1 will work 
at Ihe future aqu · , ,J m-museum 
as volunteers, intems and salar-
ied employees. Patrick J . Patek. 
president of the Stephen and 
Mary Birch Foundation, which 
donated $6 million for the 
Scripps aquarium project , said, 
"The truslee of the foundation 
remain firmly committed to 
supporting Scripp~ Institution in 
creating a new aquarium-
museum . This is a most worth-
while project for San Diego Ihat 
de erves the support of the entire 
community." @]

KABUKI 
. MACBETH 

Shozo SalO's Kabuki Macbeth is a spectacular blend of 
two distinct theatrical traditions. Using Shakespeare's 
themes and characters, the Elizabethan text has been 
abbreviated to accommodate the classical Japanese 

elements of stylized gesture, ritual dance, make-up and 
puppetry. This production is a stunning display of 

theatrical values reflecting the richness of 
Shakespeare's language.

Sodium 
Continued from pale 1 
UCSf. 

A study appearing in the Oct. 
22 issue of the New England 
Journal of Medicine by Kurtz, 
kidney specialist Dr. H?moudi 
A. AI-Bander and Morris sug-
gests that sodium in forms other 
than salt does not increase blood 
pressure in men with the most 
common form of hypertension, . 
e sential hypertension. 

Essential hypertension is 
chronic high blood pressure with 
no known cause. In their study 
of five men with essential hyper-
ten s ion , sod ium chloride 
increased blood pressure, but 
sodium citrate did not. 

Because the current study was 
conducted in only five men, the 
results should be considered pre-
liminary, the researchers caution, 
and should not be used as a basis 
for making dietary recommen-
dations in the management of 
high blood pressure. 

Over the past decade many 
health organizations, including 
some government agencies , have 
recommended that Americans 
restrict the dietary use of sodium, 
not just salt, based on the 
assumption that all forms of 
sodium can increase blood 
pressure. 

The new study suggests, 
instead, that sodium and chlo-
ride both are important in 
increasing blood pressure in 
those with salt-sensitive hyper-
tension , but that neither one 
alone is sufficient. 

The research was supported 
by the National Institutes of 
Health , unrestricted gifts from 
the Church and Dwight Corpo-
ration and Emil Mosbacher, Jr. , 
Foundation, and grants from the 
National Dairy Board and

CI 22 experiments with sex roles 
Continued rrom page I 
in life: they ca n marry money, 
work at a career, or stay home 
and take care of children . Many, 
of course, have no option and 
must work OUI of nece silY. 

All that a wo man need 10 
meet a man' requirements 1 10 
be beautiful. If he is that, she 
will be laken care of. Men , how-
ever, ha ve e\en fewer options -
they must a ll work full time. Far-
rell e en stated thaI men. in fac t, 
" have even Ie s than one option," 
for men must also be succe ful. 
Full-time work must also be 
socially acceptable and sta ble 
work . A ha ndsome waiter will 
not be a~ loved as a homely sur-
geon . Soth sexes are under pre -
sure from society to fulfill these 
requ irements so they will be 
loved and accepted . Dr. Farrell 
attempted to relate these ideas to 
CI22 by having males and females 
reverse roles . 

Instructed by Dr. Lola Ross, 
this course has been very popu-
lar, every quarter it has been 
offered, with every available seat 
and section of floor occupied . 

"Soys," Dr. Farrell began , 
"Come up to the front of the 
room while the women move up 
into their seats closest to the 
front." "I use the term ' boys, , .. he 
said, "to show you how it feels to 
be 'boys' among 'women: " 
referring to how the term 'girls' 
always seems quite proper in 
conjunction with ' men .' 

After all of the studenls were 
assembled in their respective 
places, he said, "Every woman i 
in a beauty contest every day of 
her life." She is always being 
judged on her appearance by 
men and by other women. He 

instructed the guys on stage 10 
become as vi ible a possible 
wilhout becoming physical be-
ca use "a woman ' power is in her 
vi ibility ... I wanl you 10 think 
of your bod y as yo ur primar 
funcl io n."To the women he aid. 
"Look over Ihese piece . I wanl 
you to think about which one of 
these boy you would want to 
take home to bed with you thi s 
evening. " 

He made the women group 
themsel es as to how they be-
lieved Ihey would be financiall y 
10 years in the future . Tho e who 
sa w themselves as making 
$40,000 and up annuall were 
instructed to sit in the front row. 
with incomes represented as 
decreasing as the rows progressed 
to the rear of the room. 

Most of the men were not 
comfortable at all , averting their 
eyes from the direct stares of the 
women and squirming nervously. 
Their discomfort appeared to 
intensify when Farrell had rows 
of boys step up to the front of the 
crowd and 'displa y' themselve . 
" Which piece do you like the 
best?" he asked the women. 
" What do you like about him? 
Nice legs?" "Turn around , pie-
ces," he directed . "Which rear 
view do you think is the best?" 
"Okay, this guy's got good legs 
and this one ha a nice as . How 
about the crotch area? Are you 
women looking at the crotch 
areas on these pieces?" 

After about six boys had been 
j udged the best-looking, Farrell 
instructed the women in the first 
row that they would have the 
best opportunity for success with 
these desirable "pieces." "Self-
sufficiency has been built into 

masculinit y [so] you must be 
able to offer these boys a mea-
ure of security ," he said . He told 

the boys to reject any females 
who would not be able to pro-
vide forthe m and their children. 
The women were then directed 
to approach the "piece" of their 
choice and "try 10 get as far with 
him a you can." He aid , " I want 
you to try to kis him at least 
once." 

For the next 15 minutes there 
was much confusion and exeite-
men!. Many females were embar-
rassed and shy, remaining in 
their eat while other eagerly 
ze roed in on their target . Dr. 
Farrell told the hesitant girls , 
"You will have the most success 
if you learn to treat the boys as 
objects rather than people. See-
ing women as objects is the best 
defense men have come up with 
against rejection ." 

There were both male and 
female students who left the class-
room rather than participate in 
the exercise. Afterward, however, 
when everybody retook their 
seats, there was still an overflow 
who were left to sit on the floor 
and in aisles. Even after the 
hour-long class had been dis-
missed, quite a few students 
remained to speak to the news 
crew and discuss their reactions. 

After the initial discomfort, 
the boys discovered that they 
possessed a certain power, and 
they enjoyed i!. They found that 
they could refuse the women 
who did not possess the qualities 
they desired and merely wait for 
something beller to come along. 
One smug male student who was 
clearly unconcerned about the 
feelings of those he rejected told 

Taking a turn at Dartmouth 
By KAREN KUMM 
Senior SI"ff Wriler 

A year ago I was anxiously filling out my application for the Dartmouth Exchange Program and practicing for my inter-view. I spent last spring quarter in New Hampshire at Dart-
mouth College and it was an experience 111 never forget. 

Offered through Muir College, the exchange program is open to 
all UCSD students. A minimum G.P.A . of2.5 is required, as well as 
the completion of 60 units by the time one anticipated enrolling at 
Dartmouth . The deadline for application to this program is the end 
of the second week of the quarter preceding the quarter the student 
wishes to attend Dartmouth . 

'1 enjoyed every day I was at Dartmouth. Sounds corny, but it's 
true. A school that is over 200 years old , set in the beautiful New 
England countryside, part of the Ivy League, and which also has the 
reputalion of being one of the top part y schools in the nation has a lot 
going for it . 

Being at Dartmouth was exciting because it is so different from 
UCSD. School spirit and pride ring stro ng throughout the school, 
and there's a tighl bond of class unity as well. There are only about 
4 ,500 students at Dartmouth , so each class ha s a lillie over 1,000 
students. Practically everyone graduates in four years, which makes 
graduation a very special time; each class having the opportunity to 
become very close. 

No Sun God her. - The Baker Library Tower ave 
Dartmouth Hall contrast sharply with UCSD's contemporary archi-
tecture just as does the college life at each university. 

As an exchange student, and 
particularly as a female, I re-
ceived a lot of attention from 
Dartmouth men. Dartmouth was 
an all-male institution until 1972. 
Today there are still more men 
than women - the ratio being 
about two to one - so any new 
women on campus recei ve a fair 
amount of attention . 

A 101 of women at Dartmouth 
are feminists, and there are con-
stant complaints and demon-
strations about sexism on cam-
pus . In facl, there were a lot of 
demonstrations about a variety 
of issues, especially pOlitical 

See DARTMOUTH, pace 10 

the camera that he had liked 
"being able to reject someone 
like I've been rejected so many 
times." 

The females, too, found a 
power in being able to grab a 
man by virtue of their economic 
position. Most found easy suc-
cess by offering their choice a 
trip to Europe. However, only 
one female succeeded in gettinga 
kiss by tempting her "piece" with 
a trip to New York . 

All of the students seemed to 
enjoy the experiment, and Dr. 
Lola Ross, instructor of the 
course, commented that "Every 
year it's the same. The students 
become so excited ." Student 
Mike King said, "It gave me a 
unique perspective on female / -
male roles." Mark Seaman, how-
ever, was a little disappointed 
because, a!though he was ap-
proached, he was the one who 
had to take the inititative: "I 
ended up asking all the ques-
tions . I don't think the experi-
ment was very realistic." Bar-
bara Wilson tended to agree: 
"They pressure you to find 

vJ~it'''i''~ C~t't'> 
.froreVl ~f"o"'nS 

VV\; ~~ It .. ., Job 
")"~et" ~\o\eir d#o'1 

someone in five minutes . There's 
no opportunity to make eye con-
tact and know whether someone 
really wants to meet you or not." 

Dr. Farrell stated that he ws 
playing the role of social pres-
sure and that the students'friends 
compounded that pressure. In 
real situations, this pressure is 
normally present : "People need 
approval from their friends. They 
do not want to be rejected in 
front of their peers." 

When the exercise was over, 
Farrell stated that over the years 
students have not changed a great 
deal. "They are still shy, un-
certain, wanting approval." Far-
rell asserted that much of the 
blame for sexism can be placed 
on pornography. While male 
pornography turns women inlo 
sexual objects , female por-
nography turns men into differ-
ent objects. The oldest form of 
female pornography has been 
the romance novel which pre-
sents men as "success objects," 
meaning that the man's purpose 
is merely for economic and social

tand at a gut level what Ihe 

other sex experiences." There 
ca n be no kind of equality until 
this understanding come 
about. [QJ security . Farrell said that the 

lalest form of female por-
nography is the female self-
improvement book, such as "Men 
Who Hate And The Women 
That Love Them." These books 
exploit men as "je rk objects ," 
meaning that all men are blamed 
for all of women's problems. 

The new trend i reverse sex-
ism - modern women wanl men 
10 take on Ihe female role even 
though they know how demean-
ing that role is . In Dr. Farrell's 
view, Ihis reverse is as wrong as 
sexism againsl women. Farrell ,..-----------

Dartmouth 
exchange 
Continued from pale 8 
ones. I was impressed by the 
activism and intellectualism at 
Dartmouth. There is a lot of stu-
dent involvement in clubs, as-
sociations and sports. I found 
that Dartmouth students place 
heavy emphasis on all their activ-
ities, not just their studies. The 
environment encourages it as 
there is always so much to do. 

Dartmouth students playas 
hard as they study. About 60 
percent of the students are in-
volved in the Greek system which 
consists of close to 25 sororities 
and fraternities . Some of them 
are co-ed , At Dartmouth, the 
weekend starts on Wednesday 
nights after the house meetings 
are finished . (I've never drunk so 
much in my life .) 

My II weeks at Dartmouth 
/lew by. I took three cla~ses , all 
pass / no pass, and wrote oc-
casionally for the school news-
paper. I spent the rest of my time 
soaking up the beautiful envir-
onment, meeting new people, and 
going out as much as possible 
- which was about 4-5 nights a 
week . My friends and I did some 
travelling: a couple of trips to 
Boston , one to Montreal, and 
one to New York . I did a lot of 
running on the country roads, 
and when the weather got hot 
and humid , I'd go swimming in 
the Connecticut River on the 
edge of campus . It was a carefree 
quarter , to phrase it lightly. 

Each quarter (term) at Dart-
mouth is unique. Fall ci~arier is 
football season , which is some-
thing we probably won't see here 
at UCSD for quite a while. Fall 
is marked by beautiful autumn 
leaves and the first snowfall. 
Winter quarter is snowy and 
there' a lot of good skiing. The 
Dartmouth Winter Carnival i 
famous for the s he~r fun of it. 
Spring quarter heralds the emer-
gence of leaves and blossoms, 
the return of greenery and warm 
sunshine. Baseball and lacrosse 
are just a couple of the sports to 
watch in pring, and Green Key 
Weekend is the spring version of 
Winter Carnival. 

It was very difficult to leave 
Dartmouth, but obviously, I had 
to . There are many differences 
between Dartmouth and lJCSD 
- but what I've missed in one 
I've been able to experience in 
the other. The UCSD environ-
ment , although sometimes im-
personal, can offer things which 
Dartmouth cannot , due to this 
school's cosmopolitan location , 
Hanover can be very confining, 
and the most common complaint 
I heard from Dartmouth students 
was that they felt closed-in . 

Still , after six months of being 
back in San Diego, I often think 
of my time there and wish I could 
go back and do it again , It was a 
fantastic experience and I recom-
mend it to anyone who is inter-
ested in sampling a totally dif-
ferent college experience. 

Fifteen UCSD tudents are 
chosen to go to Dartmouth each 
quarter. Deadlines for applica-
tions for spring quarter i Fri-
day, Jan . 15. Interviews will 
be during the third week, and 
deci sions are usually made by 
the end of the fourth week . Appli-
cations and further information 
on the program can be picked up 
at the Muir College Provost's 
Office. 1m

Tritons take two weekend tournaments 
Men's b-ball 
wins La Jolla 
Classic in 
overtime 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Staff Writer 

It certainly did not come eas-
ily, but the UCSD Tritons men's 
basketball team pulled out an 
overtime thriller Saturday night 
to defeat the Cal Lutheran 
Kingsmen 109-104 in the finals 
of the annual La Jolla Classic. 

UCS D reached the finals by 
handily defeating the Simpson 
College Knight on Friday by a 
90-71 count. With the two vic-
tories, their overa II record 
improves to 8-4, impressive for a 
team expected to suffer through 
a rebuilding year. Both junior 
guard Rob Rittger and senior 
forward Kevin Stewart were 
named to the all-tournament 
team. 

Swimmers 
take Senior 
Invitational 
by 479 points 
By JONA THAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

the UC San Diego swim team 
hosted the annual San Diego 
Senior Invitational this pa t 
weekend and, for the second 
consecutive time, took the tour-
nament without difficulty, by 
earning 1,552 points between the 
men's and women's teams. 

Cal State University Bakers-
field earned second place with 
1,073 point , competing with only 
a men's team. Swim San Diego, 
a club team, finished in third 
with 969 points. 

Friday night's contest was not 
really that much of a contest. 
Aside from one Simpson player, 
6'5" center Shawny Williams, 
UCSD dominated the Knights. 

6 '10" center Andy Jedynak skies over Simpson 
College for an easy two points Friday night. 

The Triton women 'S swim team earned 932 
points to earn first place. 

Individually , the UCSD 
women's team took first place 
with 932 points. The score was 
due primarily to high finishes by 
multiple swimmers in each event. 
Laura Knochenhauer and Christy 
Parker took third and fourth 
place respectively in the 50-meter 
freestyle race. Crystal Konno 
took first place in the 2()()-meter 
individual medley, with a time of 
2: 11.96. 

Returning with a six-point 
lead after the first half, the Tri-
tons broke away and wound up 
winning by 19. UCSD's 6'IOH 
center Andy Jedynak led both 
teams in rebounds with II . and 
Kevin Stewart pumped in 20 
points. The Knights' Williams 
scored 20 and pulled down an 
additional 10 rebounds. 

Despite their poor shooting 

percentage from the floor (.409 
for the game), Simpson shot a 
perfect 10 for 10 from the free 
throw line. Nevertheless, UCSD's 
victory advanced them into the 8 
pm final Saturday night where 
they would face Cal State Lu-
theran, a full scholarship team , 
who had edged Western Connec-
ticut State in the first round , 
89-87. 

Saturday's final gave every 

indication of being a high scor-
ing affair from the onset as 
Rittgers was on target twice in 
the early going from three-point 
range, UCSD's Bill Gerlach was 
gunning accurately from the 
outside, and Cal Lutheran's Steve 
DeLaveaga netted the majority 
of his final 42 points , a new tour-
nament record. 

Although they moved out to a 
47-40 advantage as Andy Wag-

staff tipped in a shot at the half-
time buzzer, the Tritons were in 
mild trouble. Jedynak had al-
ready collected three fouls and 
the team had shown the lack of 
fundamentals in missing two lay-
ups . As it turned out, the Tritons 
would miss four lay-ups in the 
game, all of which were easy 
conversions. 

"We all play like freshmen

Jenna Banaszek, who had a 
good meet in the Tritons' last 
tournament, took third place in 
the 200-meter freestyle, finishing 
in 1:58.27. Thewomenalsohada 
second place finish in the 400-
meter individual medley relay. 

The men finished in second 
place behind CSU Bakersfield 
with 620 points . Dave Dollata

B-ball ' 
Continued from pale t 2 
sometimes," head coach Tom 
Marshall said after the game. 
"We get so happy on breakaways 
that we don't carry through and 
miss the easy shots. But we're 
coming together more and more 
as a team now, and we're really 
starting to gel." 

Gel they did at the beginning 
of the second half as they in-
creased their seven point half-
time lead to a game high 13 
points within minutes. But the 
gel did not hold as DeLaveaga 
(all-tournament team and M V P 
of the Classic) continued to con-
nect from all over the court, 
Kingsman James Faulk played 
ferociously under the boards, and 
all-tournament team selection 
David Rowlands connected on 
three of his five three-pointers 
(he was five for five from that 
range) to bring the Kingsmen 
back into the game. With 2: 12 
remaining, Cal Lutheran moved 
into an 88-87 advantage, their 
first lead in the game. 

Stewart then immediately hit 
a lay-up to move the Tritons 
back in front, but Faulk tipped 
in a shot at the other end on the 
Kingsmen's next possession to 
move back in front 90-89 with 
I :26 left. After a few more 
changes of possession, UCSD's 
Ger[ach was fouled and put on 
the line to shoot a one and one. 
His first shot tied the game, but 
his second shot would not fall 

After both teams were called 
for five-second ball handling vio-
lations on subsequent pos-
sessions, Cal Lutheran had 
ownership of the ball near half-
court with eight seconds [eft and 
the score deadlocked in a tie. 
After a timeout , Cal Lutheran 
inbounded the ball to Blake 
.Miraglia, but his jumper from 
the top of the key hit the back of 
the rim and out of bounds as 
time ran out. UCSD breathed a 
collective sigh of relief and got 
back to business in the overtime. 

The overtime period began as 
Jedynak, who was soon to foul 
out, sank two free throws. After 
DeLaveaga answered with two 
free throws of his own, consecu-
tive baskets by Wagstaff and 
Stewart and two free throws by 
Rittgers gave UCSD a com-
manding six point lead at 98-92 
in the brief five minute period. 

Cal Lutheran showed signs of 
another comeback when Jeff 
Logsdon canned a three-pointer 
to bring the Kingsmen within 
three , but they would never get 
any closer than that. With time 
running out, the Kingsmen had a 
chance to tie when Rittgers blew 
a pass to a wide open Wagstaff, 
but DeLaveaga missed his three 
point attempt. 

On the next possession , 
UCSD's Dan Troy was fouled 
and his two foul shots sealed the 
victory for the Tritons. 

"What people should realize is 
that we've beaten two teams this 
year whose players are on full 
scholarships (Cal Lutheran and 
Point Lorna Nazarene)." Mar-
shall said. "I'm very pleased with 
our production this year, and 
with three home games coming 
up , we should be in good shape 
[for a playoff spot]." 

Rittgers led the Tritons in 
scoring with 25 points while 
Stewart added 23 . UCSD had 
five players in double figures 
scoring (Rittgers, Stewart, Ger-
lach , Wagstaff and Jedynak) .

Art and reason 
When Mark and I decided to spend 

the weekend at his mother's housc, 
I never imagined I would be walking 
into a mouse's nightmare. There were 
cats everywhere. 

Cat plaques, cat statues, cat clocks, 
even a cat mat. I couldn't begin to dupli-
cate her collection of kitty litter ifI spent 
a year at a garage sale. Conspicuously 
absent, however, was a real cat. Strange, 

I thought, and began to fear that a 
weekend with cat woman could be a 
lot less than purr-fect. 
But then she came home, and 
Mark introduced her. She was 
dressed surprisingly well-no 
leopard pants. In fact, you 
could say she was the cat's meow, 
but Hi rather not. 

She oft-ered me a cup of Dutch Choc-
olate Mint. Now that was something 
I could relate to. Then she brought it 
out in the most beautiful, distinctly 

unfeline china Hi ever seen. As we 
sipped, I found out that Mrs. Campbell 
has my same weakness for chocolate, 
loves the theater as much as I do, but, 
incredibh; never saw "Cats." So Mark 
and I arc 'taking her next month.
