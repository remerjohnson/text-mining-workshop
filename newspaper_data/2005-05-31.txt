Regents approve bid 
for Los Alamos lab 
Board optimistic about 
management prospects 

UC delays professional fee vote 

By JACLYN SNOW 
Contributing Writer 

In the latest developments in 
the University of California's Los 
Alamos National Laboratory bid, 
the UC Board of Regents voted II-
I to submit a proposal to the U.S. 
Department of Energy to renew 
the university's management and 
operations at the Los Alamos lab. 

The regents also voted to 
appoint Michael R. Anastasio, a 
nuclear phy icist, as director of the 
laboratory, which deals primarily in 
nuclear research. 

The proposal comes after the 
university announced its part-
nership with corporate com-
panies Bechtel National, Inc. , 
BWX Technologies, Inc., and 
Washington Group International 
in a bid appeal to the Energy 
Department, which owns the lab. 
The university bid will compete 
against University of Texas and the 
Livermore, Calif.-based nonprofit 
Tri-Valley Communities Against a 
Radioactive Environment, both of 
which have announced intentions 
to submit bids. 

The UC regents said they were 
optimistic about the university's 
chance to renew management of 
the laboratory, which has been run 
by the university since 1942. 

"The UC-Bechtel-Ied team is 
perfectly positioned to preserve the 
world-class scientific mission of 
Los Alamos while maximizing the 
quality and accountability of the 
laboratory's business, management, 
ecurity and operational functions, " 

UC President Robert C. Dynes 
stated in a press release. "We at the 
university have recognized that the 
management of these laboratories 
in the 21 st century requires a team 
effort, one bringing together skills 
that are greater than what the uni-
versity alone can offer. And we have 
put together a team that I believe is 
incredibly strong." 

The system also manages the 
Lawrence Berkeley ational 
Laboratory and the Lawrence 
Livermore ational Laboratory. 
Congressional legislation passed in 
2003 put the three laboratories up 
for competitive bidding following

The Board of Regents 
deferred a vote last week that would 
have determined whether tuition 
for UC professional school stu-
dents would increase by as much 
as 7 percent for the 2005-06 school 
year. 

oting that several regents with 
interest in the issue were absent 
from the meeting, Chairman Gerald 
L. Parsky announced that a special 
board meeting would be scheduled 
for an undetermined time for the 
presentation of the two proposed 
increases, according to a UC Office 
of the President press release. 

Last ovember, the regents 

approved a 3-percent profession-
al-school tuition increase to help 
make up for the $500 miJljon in 
state budget cuts. hould the new 
items pass, tuition for orne pro-
fessional-school students would be 
raised by a full 10 percent in the 
2005-06 academic school year.

Student orgs boosted in final budget Senators give nod to org 
summer travel spending 

New campus fraternity receives 
initial summer funding allocation 

Council holds off stipend, A.S.P. funding discussions 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

Senior Staff Writer 

After almost five hours of 
deliberation, the A.S. Council 
voted 18-4-0 to pass its bud-
get for 2005-06, which includes 
more money to student orga-
nizations and less to A.S. Safe 
Rides than originally proposed. 

Initial funding for Safe Rides, 
an A.S. service that provides free 
transportation home to stranded 
UCSD undergraduate students, 
was cut down to $27,000 in order 
to add $1,400 to annual event 
funding. The move was a step up 
from previous years, when the 
A.S. Council allocated a smaller 
budget to Safe Rides, according 
to Thurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator Kate Pillon. 

"I am very happy with the 
council's decision to prioritize 
[Safe Rides] in the budget by 
giving it the money to actu-
ally sustain it," she said. "I am 
confident that we will not have 
to reallocate to A.S. Safe Rides 
next year, which will be a huge 
improvement over past years." 

The financial boost to Annual 
Events Unallocated, a new line 
item created by Vice President 
Finance Greg Murphy, is the 
first in a series of changes to

the funding processes of campus 
events, Murphy said. Changes 
will include streamlining the 
Student Organizations Funding 
Advisory Board process so 
that student organizations can 
have consistent funding from 
Associated Students for annual 
events, he said. SOFAH is the 
main financial advisory commit-
tee for allocating all quarterly 
student organization funding. 

Even with the latest additions 
to this year's budget, the funding 

to student organizations was not 
enough, Pillon aid. The total 
pot for student organizations 
dropped 1.5 percent from last 
year's budget. However, more 
large-scale events will also be 
allowed to request the funding 
this year, including the annual 
Cultural Celebration and the 
Excel Leadership Conference, 
she said.

Student organizations partici-
pating in summer conference and 
competitions are now eligible to 
receive funding from Associated 
Students, under recently approved 
changes to the A.S. financial 
bylaws. 

In it May 25 meeting, the A.S. 
Council overwhelmingly voted to 
amend its bylaws, which had previ-
ously prohibited the council from 
funding any activity taking place 
between the end of the spring aca-

demic quarter and the beginning 
of the subsequent fall quarter. 

The amendment was meant 
to provide all students with an 
eq ual opportunity to participate 
in national conference and com-
petitions, rather than penalize 
organizations whose activities took 
place during the summer, accord-
ing to T hurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator Ja on Hoskins, who 
introduced the legislation.

quarter [A.S. activity feel , but

Regents: Proposal would 
increase pharmacy school fees 

continued from page I 
If approved, the action would 

raise an approximate $3 .7 mil-
lion dollars for UC professional 
schools, in addition to the $37 
million generated by the 2004-05 
fee increases. Twenty-five percent 
of the revenue raised by these new 
fees would go toward financial 
aid for needy students, according 
to the proposal. The rest of the 
money would be earmarked for 
addressing budget problems and 
continuing efforts to maintain pro-
gram quality. 

However, UCOP is not rul-
ing out more fee increases in the 
future. 

"The financial circumstances of 
the program are severe and will 
require greater fee increases ov~r 
time," the UCOP proposal stated. 

Speakers ~t a regents meeting 
last week expressed a variety of 
concerns about the issue, including 
the duration, timing and necessity 
of the potential fee imposition on 
graduate students. 

"We can't expect the state leg-
islature to start shoveling money 
at the professional schools," said 
UC Berkeley's Boalt Law School 
Dean Christopher Eclley. "So the 
question is, how do we finance our 
programs?" 

Also presented at the meeting 
was a comparison of UC schools 
with their competitors, which indi-
cated that both tuition levels and 
professors' salaries are lower than 
those at public universities of simi-
lar standing. 

UCLA Anderson School of 
Management Dean Bruce Willison 
explained that the UC system was 
charging less than half of its com-
petitors' tuition back in 2003. Since 
2000, there has been a 5 -percent 

reduction in UC faculty, partially 
attributed to reduced salaries. 

"We are concerned that the 
budget has been reduced," said 
Anthony Manoguerra, associate 
dean for student afhirs at UCSD 
Slcaggs School of Pharmacy, the 
only professional school to experi-
ence a fee increase under the pro-
posal. W[t's a balancing act between 
the debt of our students and the 
negative impact on the school if the 
fees are not increased." 

Around 95 percent of stu-
dents who attend UCSD Slcaggs 
School of Pharmacy are receiv-
ing financial aid, according to 
Manoguerra. It is unclear at this 
time what effects financial aid 
might have on the accessibility 
of professional school to those 
students, he added. 

The largest increases under 
the proposal would be in the cost 
of UCLA's business and UC 
Berkeley's law schools, which could 
see their yearly tuitions increase by 
as much as $1 ,163 each. 

"The question for the regents 
is whether or not you want at 
least one first-class law school in 
the UC system," EdIey said. "We 
would implore the regents to be 
maximally £Iexible." 

While some UC officials at 
the meeti ng questioned whether 
professional-school fee increases 
were the only way to maintain the 
quality of university programs, 
all agreed that increased revenue 
was a necessary goal. 

"We need the ability to keep 
those fees to finance the pro-
grams that will help us strive for 
excellence," Willison said.

Staff members 

honored in program 
The 20th year of UCSD's staff 

recognition program honored 10 
staff members Who contributed sig-
nificantly to the campus and the city 
of San Diego. The honorees were 
recognized at the UCSD Exemplary 
Staff Employee of the Year award 
ceremony last week. 

Leann Cortimiglia, principal staff 
employee of the year. was honored 
for her work as a nurse at the UCSD 
Regional Burn Cenler. Cortimiglia 
also made an impact at home, as 
a foster mother to five burn-center 
patients. 

Aaron Borovoy, a senior publica-
tions coordinator, has been a lead-
ing coordinator in UCSD Publications 
projects and has developed software 
that tracks and integrates campus 
publication projects. Borovoy's soft-
ware responds quicker to client needs 
and generates financial and staff-
ing reports, saving hours of labor. 
Borovoy's achievements reached cel-
ebratory status after city councilmem-
ber Toni Atkins proclaimed an "Aaron 
Borovoy Day" in the third district of 
San Diego. 

Penny Dockry serves as program 
manager for the Center for Marine 
Biodiversity and Conservation at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
and was honored for her role in 
CMBCs growth into a multimillion-
dollar operation. 

Other honorees included senior 
custodian supervisor Theotis Duncun, 
Lourdes Felix, executive assistant to 
the vice chancellor of health sci-
ences and director of catering Julia 
Engstrom. 

White faculty leading 
on campuses 

A national study by the U.s. 
Department of Education reported 
that white faculty members outnum-
ber all other ethnicities in higher edu-
cation teaching positions. On aver-
age, BO.3 percent of full-time college 
faculty members are white, according 
to the data. 

The report also showed that, 
while Asian faculty members out-
number black faculty members at 
public doctoral universities, the 
number of black teachers is greater 
than the number of Asian teachers 
at community colleges. 

The report also examined the 
gender ratios of college fac ulty, 
which are split almost evenly at 
community colleges, according to 
the data. 

Teaching positions at public doc-

Scientists find new 
way to map quakes 
Scientists at the Scripps Institution 

of Oceanography have found a new 
way of imaging the Sumatra-Andaman 
earthquake, which caused a devastat-
ing tsunami last December and killed 
hundreds of thousands of people in 
South Asia. 

The new methods have exposed 
unique perspectives on the location 
of the quake, which scientists now 
believe to have occurred farther north 
than originally reported. 

By using the earliest Seismic 
waves created by an earthquake to 
construct in-depth images of earth 
movements within 30 minutes, 
the scientists said they hope their 
research will aid in the development 
of public-warning and tsunami·alert 
systems. 

Hidden emotions 
influence consumption 

Exposure to subliminal facial 
expressions affects student con-
sumption of liquids, according 
to studies led by UCSD associ-
ate professor of psychology Piotr 
Winkielman. 

Study subjects were subliminally 
shown photographs of happy, angry 
or neutral faces, then offered water 
and lemon-lime Kool-Aid . 

Winkielman found that subjects 
drank almost twice as much when 
exposed to the hidden smiles than 
frowns. 

Test subjects were not aware of 
emotional change, even if their actions 
had changed after emotional cues. 

Government to look at 
. collegiate steroid use 

The National Collegiate Athletics 
Association has become one of the 
many _;Jorting leagues to come under 
scrutiny because of steroid scandals. 
Legislation was passed by a the 
Government Reform Committee last 
week that requires the Govemment 
Accountability Office to investigate 
steroid use of athletes on college 
campuses and steroid pol icies of 
college sports departments. The leg-
islation would also establish a sepa-
rate commission that would report to 
Congress the use of steroids in college 
athletics and suggest ways to stem 
steroid use. The bill requires approval 
from the House of Representatives 
before becoming law.

Budget: Stipends for A.S. executives, 
services debated during council meeting 

Lab: UC and corporations 
partner in Los Alamos bid 

conrinued from page I 
a separate line item last year, 
the current budget subjects all 
events to the same funding scru-
tiny, Murphy said . 

"To add [Cultural Celebration 
and Excel Leadership] without 
increasing the line item is really 
unfair to student orgs that usu-
ally request from Student Org 
Unallocated," Pillon said. "I 
think it is great to subject all 
programs to the same level of 
scrutiny, which is why I am OK 
with Cultural Celebration not 
having a line item, but we need 
to put an adequate amount of 
money in the line item, and, in 
my opinion, we didn 't." 

The creation of an annual 
events line item, which at 
$145,050 is the largest fund-
ing source within the Student 
Organizations Unallocated line 
item, will be able to provide ade-
quate funding to campus organi-
zations, according to Murphy. 

"Annual events account for 
almost half of all the funding we 
give to student organizations," 
Murphy said. "So by showing 
our commitment to funding 
these type of events, Associated 
Students is promoting UCSD 
traditions and giving students 
the support they need to put on 
some pretty sweet events." 

During the meeting, several 
council members contested the 
issue of stipends, which some 
said needed to be cut to reflect 
the smaller general budget. 

Marshall Junior Senator Jason 
Hoskins proposed staggering 
A.S. executive stipends to reflect 
the amount of work put in by 
each member. Pillon agreed with 
Hoskins' suggestion. 

"[ also think that to run more 

efficiently, we should not pay 
all the commissioners the same 
amount, but according to the 
amount of work they do," Pillon 
said. "In other words, we should 
compensate proportionally to 
the jobs they do, not how the 
individual person does the job, 
but what the job requires. Those 
requirements are different and 
they should be compensated 
accordingly. " 

Hoskins' proposal was turned 

" While I am relieved tlutt 
the budget process is 

over I I am not p1easea 
with the outcome."

down by the council in a 1-18-4 
vote. 

lr is impossible to predict the 
efficiency of each A.S. executive, 
according to Murphy. 

"It is implausible to compare 
the hours we put in and the 
effectiveness of the job we do," 
he said. 

Stipends for A.S. elections 
manager and all 24 A.S. senators 
were eliminated in this year's 
budget. 

The council agreed that the 
Compensation Review Board 
will need to meet next quarter to 
further discuss the stipend issue. 

Council members were also 
intent on adding more to the 
student organizations funding 
pool. 

At this week's meeting, the 
council will discuss the option 
of reallocating funds from the 
Academic Success Program 
to Student Organizations 
Unallocated. 

Although some A.S. members 
were pleased that t>udget debates 
were over, others expressed hesi-
tation over the quickness of its 
approval. 

"While I am relieved that the 
budget process is over, I am 
not pleased with the outcome," 
Pillon said. "I would rather have 
the budget process continue until 
all the problems were worked out 
than have it end with comments 
like, 'We'll fix that later, or next 
week, or in the fall'"

the Los Alamos lab's inability to 
accQunt for $1.3 million in prop-
erty and the discovery that another 
$14.6 million set aside for the lab 
had been misused on meal and 
travel expenses under UC manage-
ment. Despite the controversies, 
the university was recently awarded 
a new contract for the Lawrence 
Berkeley lab. 

"In the past, there have been 
management deficiencies, but 
the personnel at Los Alamos has 
been committed to fixing those 
problems," UC Board of Regents 
Chairman Gerald L. Parsky said. 
"We've partnered with corporate 
businesses to focus on that manage-
ment. But there is a lot of work to 
be done in between now and when 
we submit the bid." 

The lab has attracted national 
attention in the last two years fol-
lowing a series of security, safety 
and financial problems under UC 
management. The lab was shut 
down for seven months after two 
classified storage devices were mis-
placed. However Los Alamos offi-
cials later discovered the disks had 
never existed and were a part of a 
computer-entry error. The regents 
said they hope that the partnership 
with management firm Bechtel will 
put security issues to rest. 

"Obviously, [this is] a brand new 
process for a private sector," Bechtel 
National President Tom Hash said. 
"We have to want it badly to win it. 
We are excited about working with 
Uc. It's a marriage made in heaven. 
We're both working in our sweet 
spots: UC in the science side, and 
us on the nOllscience side." 

The university'S involvement 
with the lab, which manufactures 
materials used for nuclear arms, and 
its partnership with corporations 

has caused protests by some stu-
dents. At the regents' meeting May 
25, about 30 student protestors with 
headrags displaying, "Education 
Yes, Bechtel No," jeered at Bechtel 
officials throughout discussions of 
the lab bid. 

Los Alamos is the nation's largest 
laboratory responsible for nuclear 
arsenals and weapons components. 

"What our primary responsibil-
ity is right now is to maintain the 
critical expertise if this nation chose 
to go into a manufacturing mode in 
the future," Dynes said. "The nwn-
bers [of nuclear components] manu-
factured right now are very low." 

The maximum management 
fee will increase from $B.7 million 
to $79 million for the winner of 
the bid, according to the Energy 
Deparonent Request for Proposals. 
Though the Los Alamos manage-
ment contract is possibly profitable, 
Parsky and the regents made it dear 
that any profits would be returned 
to the lab. Energy Department 
officials have said that raising the 
maximum pay, which is largely 
performance-based, would provide 
incentive to strengthen both busi-
ness and science at the la b. 

Appointment of Los A1amos'lab 
director, in the event the university 
wins the lab bid, was also finalized 
in last week's meetings. Michael 
Anastasio, who has more than two 
decades of experience in national 
security and nuclear weapons and 
has been leading the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory 
since 2002, was chosen to lead the 
Los Alamos lab as director. 

The regents will submit their 
bid to be considered by the Energy 
Deparonent's July 19 deadline.

REMEMBER SOME EVENTS THAT SHAPED TH E YEAR 
Elections, elections, elections everywhere, and dear old George W. wasn't the only one in on the fun. We got ourselves a brand new A.S . Council, while San Diego re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy (sort oQ, 
saw him resign five months later, and is now gearing up for round two. 
The U.S. Senate got itself a brand new batch of kooks, plus one totally 
awesome Barack Obama. The Palestinian Authority got itself a brand 
new non-kaffiyeh-wearing president and a new shot at relevancy. The 
Iraqis got their first democratic vote. Britons talked a lot about how 
much they hated Tony Blair but only dealt him a weak smack-down at 
the ballot box, returning the Labour Party to office with 37 percent 
of the vote, 5 percent less than in the last elections. In the 
wake of the February assassination of former Lebanese 
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, it seems like whenever the 
Lebanese aren't voting, they're protesting. There were 
probably more, but I just couldn't bring myself to read 
one more article about elections. And by the time next 
year's A.S. Council elections roll around, I'll probably 
still be finding more of those glossy cards with the 
names of the parties in my backpack. 

- Hanna Camp 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Another boring UCSD year has come and gone, endearingly consistent in its lack of anytlting worth talking about. There were, however, 
moments of relief here and there: The elections were 
ignored as usual, yet spiced up with the typical nasty politics 
and, to top it off, a giant alligator. Awesome. Somebody had sex 
and filmed it, which we all claimed was news because it 
was on Tv, but it was probably due to the excitement 
caused by any sex at all at UCSD. Of course, others 
also took this oppommity to somehow COlmect the 
Srudent-Run Television porn to "white male entitle-
ment," inspiring us all to new heights of oversensi-
tivity and irrationality. I suppose that we should 
start behaving as if society was dbligated to 
make us feel comfortable in every conceiv-
able manner, starting with obliterating every 
Abercrombie & Fitch ad and Sponge bob 

O n Nov. 12,2004, Scott Peterson was convicted of the first-degree murder of his wife, Laci, and second-degree murder of their unborn 
child, Connor. The murder case quickly evolved into a 
high-profile mystery show presented by the media and, 
like many other melancholy criminal cases, became a 
sensationalized storyline for Americans to follow (refer-
ring to the actual media surveillance of the trial , not the 
despicable CBS movie "Amber Frey: Witness for the 
Prosecution"). Despite the fact that the general public 
practically knew Scott Peterson's fate, along with his 
entire life story and psychological background, they 
all caved into the exploitation of Laci Peterson 's death 
that was at times blatantly plugged for financial objec-
tives, such as the above-mentioned movie, the books 
published by Scott Peterson's sister and Frey, and the 
constant reporting by media outlets. Focus on the 

actual evidence of the trial was shunted aside to 
"tabloidize" the heinous affair - excuse the 

pun. Although events like this arise every 
so often for public speculation, the Scott 

Peterson trial marked a new variation of 
a high-profile case turned soap opera: 
one where the "other woman" is made 

a hero. And, like many other male 
protagonists of television 

dramas, Scott Peterson 
received plenty of fan 
mail from American 
women, completing 

the formula for a good 
melodramatic series.

image in sight, but for some reason I don't 
think I would be listened to as patiently. 
And of course, George W Bush got re-
elected, sparking a day of grief and confu-
sion as to why the rest of the country isn't as 
intelligent as us college students. Ah, Steve York 
and George W Bush; the two of them have humbled 
us this year.

THE 2004-05 
YEAR IN REVI EW 

Will file,sharing mean death or downsizing for the recording industry? 

Don't forget 
the joker 
Cody Nabours 

G uardirm Super-Friends Team-Up presents: Ian Smith Pan and Cody Benjamin Nabours 
weighing in on the future of a record 
industry gasping its last breaths under 
the collective strain of illegal file-
haring. 

CN: Do you think there will be 
a successful effort to restore music 
buying to the way it used to be, 
back when we would pay exorbi-
tant amounts for music, because we 
couldn't get it any other way? 

ISP: No, I don't. I don't think 
that will ever happen. The longer 
and longer things go on, there is this 
growing generation of music con-
sumers who are unfamiliar with the 

way the system used to be, and will 
never ever go back to that, no mat-
ter what. 

CN: We'll always have to have 
peer-to-peer file-sharing; people 
need to share information. We live in 
an age where we connect ourselves to 
a larger web of individuals; we can't 
deny them their private right to trade 
inforn13tion. People will always steal. 
And they can't be stopped. 

ISP: Whether or not itll stealing, 
the people that do it don't consider it 
to be abnormal or deviant behavior. 
That's how they understand they're 
supposed to do it. It's what they've 
done. More and more people are 
going to think like that Certainly 
our generation, where we had a long 
period of paying for music - now if 
I want to hear a pop song, I don't go 
buy a fucking record, I just download 
it It's not always successful, but most 
of the time I can get what I want. 

CN: At some point in the future, 
it won't even be "stealing" anymore. 

ISP: They don't think of it as 

stealing, and they're the big consum-
ers of music. 

eN: If the recording industry 
thrives on people purchasing music, 
how will they survive? You can't just 

" We Uve in an age where 
we connect ourselves to a 
larger web of individuals; 
we can't deny them their 

private right to trade 
informatian. " 

have the musician pass music directly 
to the consumer. 

ISP: I think there will still be 
a recording industry; I don't think 
that downloading will actually \cill 
the recording industry. But it will 

downsize it for sure. It won't go 
away. There has to be some sott of 
instirution there that fulfills this role 
of paying for studio time, distributing 
and advertising - being the medium 
between the artist and the commer-
cial world. 

CN: Large record companies 
could try to cash in by producing 
more artists that will appeal to the 
widest audience, but the more popu-
lar a single artist or a single song 
is, the easier it will be to find and 
download, since there will be more 
people to get it from. Evenrually, the 
idea of the "superstar" will be eroded, 
because that one artist will be heavily 
downloaded, and less commercially 
viable for his or her record company. 
I read S9mething a long time ago, at 
the start of the downloading fiasco, 
that proposed the recording industry 
could be "saved" by the following: 
looking for lots of good new artists 
and selling their albums for cheap. 
After say, three albums, instead of 
selling for $5 to $8, they sell for S 10 

to S12. If they develop a fan base, 
the fans will pay the slightly higher 
price for the album; if not, they will 
disappear, leaving more room on the 
shelves for a multi rude of new artists. 
The recording industry must make 
sacrifices - instead of swimming in 
goddamn gold pools; why can't they 
live a normal life like the rest of us? 

ISP: Marketing and broadcast-
ing is so cheap and easy now that 
you don't have to have an artist that 
appeals to millions of people to justify 
spending enough money to get them 
nationally known. To do that, you 
have to get a good review on the right 
Web site, or a mention in the right 
magazine. Successful record compa-
nies do that. lndie labels like Dischord 
sell all their CDs for $10. They go 
out and find crazy shit, they take a 
risk and put out a record that a lot of 
people wouldn't put out. Sometimes 
they sell a lot of it, and the artists,like 
Bright Eyes and Saddle Creek, which

R I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
New bill can prevent 

drawn-out deaths 
Dear Editor, 

On May 26, the California 
State Assembly Committee for 
Appropriations approved AB654, 
California's Compassionate 
Choices Act. This bill, carefully 
modeled after Oregon's Aid-in-
Dying law, allows suffering ter-
minally ill patients to choose to 
end their lives with the assistance 
of a willing physician. The bill 
will soon be brought before the 
sta te Assembly for a full vote. 

Surveys show that over two 
thirds of adults in California sup-
port this bill . Moreover, a large 
majority of physicians nation -
wide consider it ethical to assist a 
suffering patient with less than 6 
months to live to die peacefully. 
In fact, over 50 percent of the 
nation's physicians support aid-
in-dying as a personal medical 
decision. 

If AB654 passes, we can all 
avoid the pain , insult, humilia-
tion and expense of a drawn-out 
death if we so choose. It pro-
vides a much needed alternative. 
It represents a major step for-

were tOtally weird and off the map 
five years ago, become huge. The 
mainstream record companies, if they 
want to survive, have to readjust their 
models from this idea of selling bil-
lions of records and spending lots of 
money on tours, fancy recording and 
marketing, because they can't make 
enough money on record sales to do 
it anymore. 

CN: If there are fewer money-
making opportunities, it will attract 
people that are interested in finding 
and distributing new music, not peo-
ple who are only interested in money. 
They just need to make enough to 
live comfortably. We need people 
in the job who are interesred in the 
job, not the money, and they will do 
it better. 

ISP: Is the public till going to 
demand a traditional superstar? Is 
there a contradiction in that the 
public demands it, but won't spend 
enough money to support it? 

CN: It doesn't have to be as 
gigantic as it is now, but there will 
be a redistribution of wealth - the 
superstars won't be as obscenely rich, 
and hopefully there will be much 
more innovative new music on the 
opposite end. 

Passerby: This sounds like a 
Keynesian music model. Its a music 
welfare state. 

ISP: The problem is that there will 
always be someone who will give the 
people what they want. People won't 
consume what d1ey should consume. 
lbats what we have now. 

CN: But if giving the people what 
they want results in a more popular 
product, it will be more adversely 
affected by downloading, since it wiU 
be easier to get. If record companies 
cared less about giving the people 
what they want, and cared more 
about putting out lots of interesting 
music, wouldn't that be better? 

ISP: Thats how indie labels do 
it. The guy that runs the label likes 
something, so he signs it. 

CN: The superstar will die. As 
"stealing" mu ic becomes more and 
more prevalent, they will try to srop 
it, but they can't. They don't want to 
adapt, but they will be forced to. Let's 
make a stand for once. Let's not let 
the corporations tread over us. We 
have them by the balls. We have the 
masses on their computers. lnstead 
of a wave of people in the streets, it's 
a wave of people in their bedrooms. 
They aren't going' to stop us. They 
can try suing us, but there will be 
more and more and more of us. And 
they have to improve. If they change, 
it's going to be better anyways. There 
will be more and better artists to 
choose from. Its better than the 10 
videos on rotation on MTv. Labels 
survive by selling CDs for S8 to $10 
and offering a good variety of artists, 
not by just hyping the album with 
lots of money, payola to the radio, 
magazines and television - that they 
probably own anyway. 

ISP: I'm going to go get some ice 
cream.

income and I was wondering 
how fiscally responsible it was," 
McCombs said. "But then I real-
ized that Associated Students sends 
delegates to the U .S. Student 
Association during the summer and 
thought it would be hypocritical to 
[exclude other organizations]."

if students are in a club with a 
national conference in the sum-
mer, they can't access the money," 
Hoslcins said. "Even if the confer-
ence is in the summer, you send a 
delegation and they bring back the 
information to the general body. 
It still has the same benefits to the 
student body." 

Hoskins said that he first intro-
duced the legislation in fall 2004 
- after the council had temporar-
ily suspended the bylaw to fund a 
summer conference - but that 
the senators had decided against 
the permanent amendment at the 
time. 

A.S. Vice President Finance 
Greg Murphy also said that the 
council had previously suspended 
the bylaw when organizations had 
requested summer funding. 

"Historically, [Student 
Organiz.ations and Leadership 
Operations] advisers have not 
signed off on funding requests for 
summer conferences," Murphy 
said. "But recently, they have 
been signing off on them and 
letting the Associated Students 
decide." 

S.O .L.O. advisers are not sup-
posed to sign funding requests that 
violate any of the council's bylaws. 
Therefore, many organizations 
have been denied the chance to 
appear before senators, at which 
time the council could vote to sus-
pend its own regulations. 

At the same meeting, the new 
fraternity Lambda Chi Alpha was 
allocated $400 to attend a national 
conference in July. The UCSD 
chapter is required to send one 

"Lambda Chi Alpha has their 
national leadership conference 
on July 28-31 in Maryland and 
there is a fine if they do not go," 
Hoskins said. "During the sum-
mer, there are no opportunities 
to find funding outside of the 
A.S. CounciL" 

During the 2004-05 school 
year, the council informally set a 
$400 allocation limit for each stu-

dent organiz.ation. Organizations 
are able to ration these funds on 
any number of conferences. 

During amendment debates, 
former interim Revelle College 
Freshman Senator Ted McCombs, 
who voted in favor of the amend-
ment, said that the council should 
consider fiscal responsibility before 
allocating money during a time 
when no fees were being collected. 

"l.nitially, I was worried about 
spending fees when we had no 

Murphy said he agreed that 
the issue should be addressed, 
but thought that the amendment 
would be advantageous if funds 
were properly a1l0cated. 

"I agree that summer confe.r-
ences are beneficial to students, 
and it is not a question of fiscal 
responsibility as long as we put 
enough money in the line items," 
Murphy said. "I proposed $19,000 
[for the 2005-06 student confer-
ences fund), not knowing that we 
would be funding summer confer-
ences." 

In the current school year, 
the same line item began with 
$20,000. Throughout the year, 
numerous organizations requested 
funds, leaving the council with 
$333 .60 remaining, after the allo-
cation to Lambda Chi Alpha. 

Due to general budgetary con-
straints, however, the approved 
2005-06 A.S . budget included 
only $19,000 for student confer-
ences and an additional $4,500 for 
student competitions. 

"We have suspended the bylaw 
in the past," Financial Controller 
Garo Bournoutian said. "This is 
giving all organizations an equal 
chance, and we just have to budget 
appropriately."

veili g he shadD 
ov r North orea 

By Thomas Kim 
Staff Writer 

Ever ince President George W. Bush's tate of the nion addres in January 2002, North Korea has gained 
increasing attention in the United States 
as part' of Bush 's "axis of evil." orth 
Korea's isolationist policies have turned 
the country into something of a clan-
de tine chocolate factory, where nobody 
goe in and nobody comes out. So it is 
no surprise that very few Americans know 
that the communist state currently faces a 
human rights disaster. 

According to a report conducted by the 
Human Rights Watch, orth Korea's gov-
ernment resembles that of Sta lin 's Soviet 

nion and Hitler's Germany. The report 
continued to state that the government 
promptly sends any opposition to camps 
si milar to Stalin 's iberian gll/ngs. North 
Korea 's failed economy, as well as its agri-
cu ltural di asters, produced a massive fam-
ine in the mid-1990s, prompting many 

orth Koreans to eek refuge across the 
border in China. There are an e timated 
10,000 to 300,000 orth Korean refugee 
livin g in China, hiding among Chinese 
ciri7ens of Korean ethnicity, according 
to II R\ . However, if they are found by 
Chinese authorities, they are promptly 
rcpatriated to North Korea, where they 
face severe puni hment in concentration 
camps and even death. The Chine e gov-
ernment recognize them not as refugees 
but as illegal immigrants and grants them 
no asylum. 

Enter L.i . .K., Liberation in North 
Korea , an organization founded in March 
at the 18th Annual Korean -American 

tudents Conference. The group first 
sought to educate Korean -American 
students about human rights issues in 
North Korea, but the organization has 
expanded from its original mission to 
encompass more than that: to bring the 
issue of North Korean human rights to 
dl e world. With chapters all over the 

niled States and Europe, L.i .N .K. has 
grown into an international effort to 
addre s various human rights is ues in 

orth Korea, such as Chinese repatria -
tion of onh Korea n refugees. The local 
L.i.N.K. chapter, called SOLi K, was 
formed ea rlier this year. 

" \Vhcn wc first started the organiza-
tion, we didn't want to i olate L.i. .K. 
from CSD, so we named it SOLiNK.," 
said Revelle College senior 00 Kim, an 
SDLiNK core member. 

But the organization no doubt faces a 
great deal of skepticism. What ca n a group 
of student activists do to help the millions 
of people under the rul e of a dictator? 

"We're just trying to make the issue 
known about in the U.S.," Kim said. 
"People need to know about what's hap-
pening first." 

One of the first projects taken on by 
the organization was to make T -shirt to 
spread a visual image with whieh the cause 
can be associated. Projects now include a 
political push, which ha the organizati n 
appealing to local pol iticians to bring the 
issue into the mainstream. T here arc also 
plans for an SDLiNK art gallery, where 
artists can show their interpretations of 

orth Korean sufferin g. In addition, Kim 
hope~ to enlist the aid of nongovern -
mental organizations such as the Red 
Cross and the United ations Human 

ommissioner for Refugees to educate 
the world about the situation . 

That may prove difficult, as a nuclear-
weapons crisis with orth Korea over-

shadows the human rights CrISIS. The 
country withdrew from the uclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003 and 
announced las t February that it has nucle-
ar weapons. On May 5, lorth Korea fired 
a test missile into the Sea of Japan, seem-
ingly flaunting its delivery capabilities. 
T he U nited States' policies towards North 
Korea were even an issue in the 2004 
election, where President Bush insisted 
that six-party talks between orth Korea, 
South Korea, the U nited States, Russia, 
Japan and China could be used to bring 
stabili ty to the peninsula. 

But Kim wants SOLiNK to rise above 
the politics of the situation. 

"We're really trying to stay away from 
politicizing the orga nization," Kim said. 
"Our goal is excl usively about the human 
rights c risis, not the politica l situation." 

~ Ieanor Roosevelt College sophomore 
Joseph Juhn first heard about SDLiNK 
from Kim la t year, when both were 
involved in the Korean-American tudent 
Association . After heari ng about the 
human rights cri is, J uhn felt compelled 
to playa larger role in the organization . 
Raised in South Korea, Juhn said he knew 
su rprisingly little about the ituation in 
Nordl Korea. 

"The ISouth] Korean government at 
this point is havi ng a 'sunshin e policy' 
which doesn 't depict orth Korea as an 
axis of evi l anymore," Juhn said. "So in 
accorda nce with the policy and govern-
ment, the media [are] tryi ng their beSt to 
depict North Korea as a friendly nation, 
therefore, and paying little attention to 
human rights issue ." 

An aspiring filmmaker, Juhn hopes 
to aid the organi zation by making films 
about North Korea to help bring the 
eause to the mainstream. 

" I want to bring awareness to the 
Korean-American community and, in a 
broader sense, American society, by mak-
ing documentaries that deal heavily with 

orth Korean defectors," he sa id . 
SOLi K 's most recent endeavor has 

been three free screenings of a docu-
mentary concerning the orm Korea n 
refugees in China. Titled "Seoul Train," 
the fi lm exa mines [he lives of refugees 
and their attempts to fl ee from China 
to other countries. The fi lm i aptly 
named becau e the North Korean refugee 
si tuation mirrors that of the U nderground 
Railroad of the American South in the 
mid- 19th century. It opens with a chilling 
image of East Asia at night, in which 
industrialized countries such as Japan , 
South Korea and C hina are illuminated by 
city lights, but orth Korea remai ns dark 
except for the capital city of Pyongyang. 
Images of gaunt, malnourished children 
picking bits of rice out of the mud to 
gain some sort of sustenance illustrate 
the reason why th ere is a six-inch height 
discrepancy between outh Korean and 

orth Korean children at age seven. T he 
Film follows two groups of refugees who 
attempt to run from China to more dcmo-
cratic nations with the aid of Harriet 
Tubman-like activists. orne manage to 
escape successfully, but others fail. 

With all the things happening in the 
world, it is easy to fa ll into the condi-
tion of "compassion fatigue." But Juhn 
remains firm in his beliefs. 

"It i one thing to know and pray for 
orth Koreans; it i another thing to put 

compassion into action," he said. "If I don 't 
help orth Koreans, who else will?"

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FEATURES 9 

By SAMANTHA HASKINS 
Contributing Writer 

On a volcanic spit of land in 
the hape of a hook, lies a veritable 
paradise, once inhabited only by 
wild pigs. While it is true that 
nearly 10 boats go missi ng each 
year in the Bermuda triangle and 
that there are hundreds of ship-
wrecks - some within wading dis-
tance of the shore - the serenity 
of the weather becrays none of this 
mysterious foreboding. 

Bermuda is a small island, only 
22 square miles in its entirety. T he 
best COllrse of cravel on the island 
is either to take the bus for one 
Bermudan dollar each way or to 
rent a scooter. T he thrill of riding 
through the jungle-like greenery, 
punctuated by the sight of wild 
chickens and genial residents, is 
astonishing. The weather is always 
temperate, and while Bermuda is 
not in fact a cropical island (it i 
off the Atlantic seaboard, due east 
of the coast of Virginia), it receives 
the benefits of clement breezes and 
eonstant temperature. 

about Bermuda is that4ileAmerican 
and Bermudan dollars are inter-
changeable. The exchange rate is 
I : I and they accept both types 
of currency everywhere, so you 
probably will receive change half 
in Bermudan money and half in 
American. Food is decidedly more 
expensive, so be prepared to spend. 
The food has a very heavy British 
influence, as the island was once a 
province of Great Britain: Expect 
curry dishes, fried foods and fish. 
(rhe best fish to be found on 
the island is tilapia.) The Swizzle 
Inn has fantastic cuisin e and by 
night turns into the Swagger Out. 
The walls are decorated with bar 
jokes and wisdoms, with one room 
reserved for guests to write on tile 
walls. They provide evera l col-
ored markers with which to make 
your own mark, should you feel 0 
inclined. 

hradise Found: Travellers can lounge on wMe and sandy beaches featuring crystaklear water (above) or gaze from beach-
front VieN balconies at the Grotto Beach Hotel (belovv) . 

The island's history is a rich and 
a sad one as it approaches the 500th 
anniversary of its discovery. The 
best time to visit is in tile su mmer, 
when it make a fair alternative 
to the expense and mind-melting 
heat of the cropics. Encru ted with 
thou ands of caves, sunken ships 
and pink-sand beaches, Bennuda 
lacks neither scenery nor places to 
see. Diving and snorkeling are two 
of dle greatest diversions, espe-
cially if you would like to see the 
ubmerged ships - but leave time 

for spelunking, hiking, barhopping 
and se<l tours, as well. 

Perhaps the mo t affable detail 

T he nightlife is marginal, but 
if you are determined, it is quite 
easy to create your own fun. The 
legal drinldng age in Bermuda is 
18, 0 visitors who are underage 
can experience the bar scene a few 
years ahead of thei r time. Beware 
tile Dark and Stormy, a ra ther 
toxic concoction of what tastes like 
a mixture of rum and paint thinner 
and is the most famous drink on 
the island. Most hotels hou e thei r 
own bar, and if you are centrally 
located, there are many others that 
are equally accessible. 

Lodging can be expen ive, so 
the best idea i to book your tickets 
and you r room together through 
an online cravel agent such as 
Travelocity or Orbitz. Try to peruse 
as many options as po sible to find

I ~DITOR'S SOAPBOX Bermuda: 
Moving from copy to management to chief 
New editor in chief welcomes new respollsibility 

Travellers can 
opt for classy, 
tropical venue 

Iy GRANT SCHRADER 
Managing Editor 

This wasn't my plan, nor my 
goal. I haven't wanted this since 
day one. 

When I graduated from high 
school and made me transition 
into college, my philosophy -
which] now regret - was simple: 
Pur in me minimum amount of 
work necessary to get the job 
done. In all facets of my life . I 
know that's disconcerting, espe-
cially from the new editor in 
chief of the official newspaper 
of UCSD, bur it was merely an 
overcom pensation for an exha ust -
ing high school career, with an 
especiaHy strenuous senior year, 
during whi ch I undertook my 
tirst venture into chiefdom, for 
my high school newspaper. 

I'd love to tell you that I 
came to UCSD with aspirations 
of becoming editor in chief once 
again, to further my fluency in 
journalistic procedure. That I've 
wanted this job since the day I 
first walked into the office. But, 
as I previously mentioned, it's 
just not me case. Unlike others 
currently on staff, I did not come 
to UCSD with journalism on the 
mind . To the contrary, I was ini-
tially reluctant to enlist in the 
ranks of the newspaper, fearing I 
would become a one-trick pony 
in a two-trick world. 

But, on the recommendation 
of my brother, a former asso-
ciate news editor, I joined the 
Guardian anyway, without fully 
rea lizing what exactly a Guardian 

membership entailed. 
I started as a copy reader, hired 

for my previous experience with 
AP style and all-around, border-
line-disturbing love for editing. 
When the copy editor position 
opened up the spring quarter 
of my freshman year, it was a 
moment of truth - the time had 
come for me to decide wheth-

" 

paper to educate those masses in 
as neutral a manner as possible. 
It is this responsibility that has 
instilled passion in me and it is 
the primary reason why 1 chose to 
continue on as editor in chief. 

Though I might not have 
wanted to be editor in chief when 
I first walked into the office, I 
did know there was something 

er the Guardian 
was somethi ng r 
wanted to pursue 
furmer or whether 
my contributions 
to the paper would 
remain a $6.75-
per-hour commit-
ment twO days a 
week. [ cho e the 
former, marking 
the death of my 
minimalist phill-
sophy, and send-
ing me off on my 
personal Guardian 
odyssey, incogni-
zant of what lay 
ahead. 

.. _ [T]he time had 
come far me to 

decide whether the 

special about the 
Guardian. My first 
introduction to the 
paper came in the 
form of a big, bald 
man by the name 
of Rinaldo, the 
former Hiatus edi-
tor, who gave me 
my application and 
came to symbolize 
the dynamic of the 
G/lardian office 

My journey 

Guardian was 
something I wanted 
to pursue further ar 

whether my 
contributions would 

remain a $6.75,per, 
hour commitment 

. that kept .me going 
all these years. 

most recently led 
me to become the 
managing editor, a 
posi tion that I held 
this past year. Not 

As an organi-
zation, the paper 
serves as a medium 
in which unique 
people are bonded 
by a similar inter-
est in journalism 

two days a week. " and a common goal 
to prod uce the best 

only did I make Strides in finding 
the right balance of time between 
schoolwork and Guardian, but I 
also discovered the true mean-
ing of hard work. The personal 
sense of accomplishment felt 
when the product you helped 
create is released to the masses . 
The responsibility of the news-

product possible. 
These are people with whom I 
wouldn't have necessarily spent 
time otherwise, not because there 
is anything wrong with them or 
because they aren't incredible 
individuals, but because we travel 
in different circles, and without 
the Guardian there would be no 
overlap. I am grateful for that 

overlap and the opportunity to 
work with all those I have over 
the years. 

Clayton, you're an impossible 
act to follow, and I can only 
hope to meet the new standard 
you have set for the Guardian. 
And Mather, there's so much to 
say about you that I feel ridicu.-
lous trying to condense it to a 
sentence or two. But, there are 
few people in my life who are 
as intelligent and driven as you. 
Your mere presence makes me a 
better person. Thank you for the 
past seven years. 

1b the rest of the staff leav-
ing us - Cynthia, Matt, Hans, 
Travis, Anna, Lisa, Sarah, Jia and 
the innumerable writers and pho-
tographers - it has been my 
privilege to work with you. Your 
efforts have made all the differ-
ence this year and they have not 
gone unappreciated. Good luck 
next year wi th all your ventures. 
I have no doubts of your future 
success in this world. 

To our readers, the Guardian 
is nothing without you . You read 
our stories, you keep us honest, 
and ultimately, you embody our 
staff. I encourage you to con-
tact me at edito~ucsdguardiun . 
org with any and all questions, 
comments or concerns you may 
have. I look forward to hearing 
from you. 

To the continuing and incom-
ing staff, get excited about next 
year. It is only through true pas-
sion in its staff that the Gllardion 
can thrive. I will do my best to 
show you the way.

the cheapest one. The Grotto Beach 
Hotel is at once lovely and amiably 
staffed. Its view is breathtaking: 
The ocean is steps away from the 
rooms and the sands on this side 
of the island are stark white. There 
are twO shipwrecks close enough to 
swim out to and touch with your 
finge.rtips, if the eeriness of them 
doesn't drive you away first. The 
accommodations are nice, and most 
of the hotels have a beachfront. 

It is rare to be far from the 
airport, considering that traversing 
the entire island from end to end 
is a shorter distance than a typical 
drive across San Diego. Customs 
coming in and out of Bermuda are 
far more pleasant that those in the 
United States, and it is also handy 
that a passport is unnecessary. If 
you choose to go Bermuda, all you 
need is a birth certificate and a 
valid lD. 

Overall, if you are planning a 
tropical vacation, Bermuda is a 
fine, classy choice. If you are look-
ing for a drink-all-night-till-you-
puke-in-the-street spot, Bermuda 
is probably not for you, and you 
should probably go to Cancun. 
However, for those looking for 

. something a little more sedate, 
much cleaner; safer and entirely 
more breathtalcing, this little island 
has as much to offer above the 
sea as below it. Immerse yourself 
in this paradise and you will not 
regret a single moment - and be 
sure to drink as much ginger beer 
as you can, or you'll miss it after 
you leave.

Want to write open 
source this summer? 

Want to make money? 

lNV£'£N,£NC£ Want to do both? 
The open source model of software development is one of the most effective innovations 
of all time. Who doesn't love the idea of great programmers working on their own time 
to crank out elegant code that benefits us all? 

"Summer of Code," Google's latest open source initiative, is expressly designed to 
get the brightest minds on campus contributing code to open source initiatives and 
inventing new open source programs. After all, while altruistic motives are praiseworthy 
and the rewards of peer recognition sweet, the idea of a financial prize for stellar work 
predates the Nobel Commission - and who really needs money more than broke college 
stUdents? 

So here's the skinny: we 'll give $4,500 to applicants who successfully work with a 
sponsoring organization or advisor to create innovative or useful open source software. 
We'll also get you a t-shirt to go along with the cash.

Cyn City: First female sports 
head faced adversity at UCSD 

continued from page ,6 
offer a minimum of $250,000 in 
athletic grants. In response, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson submitted 
an athletic scholarship proposal 
that would offer Tri ton athletes 
$300,000 in grants. But his pro-
posal was met with concern from 
faculty members and campus orga-
nizations, including the Council of 
Provosts and the Graduate Student 
Association. 

"Whatever the direction the uni-
versity goes, there needs to be a com-
mitment to do things right," Sweet 
said when asked about scholarships at 
UCSD. "And whether scholarships 
are a part of that or not, UCSD has 
demonstrated that it can be competi-
tive because of the quality of student 
athletes it has attracted to UCSD." 

At the AWSM Convention, 
Sweet served as a panelist focusing 
on the state of Title IX in inter-
collegiate athletics. Title IX is a 
federal statute passed in 1972 pro-
hibiting discrimination on the basis 
of sex in any educational program 
receiving federal funding. Although 
UCSD does not provide athletic 
scholarships, the university must 
provide equal opportunities for 
men and women to participate in 
sports and enforce equal treatment 
in II areas, including equipment, 
scheduling of practices, coaching 
and recruitment. While at UCSD, 
Sweet ensured the university was in 
compliance with Title IX. 

"There's actually what's called 

a laundry list of II different com-
ponents that an institution should 
be measured on to ensure compli-
ance with Title IX," Sweet said. "r 
believe that right from the start, we 
had a commitment to ensure that 
our male and female student ath-
letes were treated equitably." 

However, not everyone at UCSD 
initially supported Title IX . 

"There was some resistance 
from some of the traditional male 
programs that had been accustomed 
to having more than the lion's share 
of resources, so when we had to 
share those resources, they weren't 
enthusiastic about it," Sweet said. 

Edwards, who followed Sweet 
as director, continued enforcing 
UCSD's compliance with Title IX, 
aclrnowledging the positive effects 
of female participation in sports. 

"At UCSD, we have always 
finnly believed in the philosophy 
of Title IX and conducted our pro-
gram accordingly," Edwards state(J 
on the UCSD Athletics Web site. 
"Personally, I would not amend the 
T itle IX statute and I don't agree 
with those who contend Title IX 
has negatively affected men's sports. 
Some administrators have cut men's 
sports to comply with Title IX, 
but there are other ways to comply 
without reducing men's opponuni-
ties. "

continued from page ,6 with Winn denying any domestic 
violence. Besides child-support issues, 

the U,,;01l- T1'ibll1lf discovered 
more financial and legal matters, 

"The incident concerning an 
ex-girlfriend that

New basketball coach 
resigns after one week 
Tritons coachless as report 
reveals legal, financial woes 

Tritons to lose two All-Americans 
Salerno earns National Coach of the Year 

8y RAEL ENTEEN 
Staff Writer 

Following the release of infor-
mation regarding late chi ld-support 
p:lyments, a past restraining order 
and financial problems, women's 
basketball coach Fentriss Winn 
announced his formal resignation 
one week after being hired . 

Winn was announced as the 
new head coach on May 20, replac-
ing Judy Malone, who retired at 
the end of the season after 29 years 
with the Tritons. However, writers 
from the Son Diego Union-Trillne 
ca lled VCSD athletic officials to 
inquire about Winn 's records of 
a suspended driver's license due 
to nonpayment of child suppOrt. 
Winn, who also has a past restrain-
ing order by his ex-girlfriend and 
tax issues, released a statement 
regarding his short-lived time at 
VCSD. 

"With great respect for the uni-
versity 1 am announcing my deci-
sion to not accept the appoinonent 
of head women 's basketball coach 
at VCSD effective immediately," 
Winn wrote in the statement he 
released on May 27. 

T he formal announcement 
ca me one week after the athletic 
deparonent decided to put Winn 
at the helm of the very successful 
women's basketball·program. The 
TritOns went 17-9 in the 2004-05 
season, barely missing out on an 

CAA Tournament berth. The 

year before, the team notched 15 
wins along with 13 10 ses to earn 
a berth in the NCAA Division II 
West Regional. 

Winn was scheduled to main-
tain the Tritons' winning ways next 
season after working as an assis-
tant coach for San Diego tate's 
women's basketball team last 
year. He also developed impres-
sive stats as a women's basket-
ball coach at Saddleback College 
and at the Bishop's School in La 
J olla. However, the recent find-
ings regarding his past will force 
the Tritons to look elsewhere for 
guidance. 

According to the U11ion Tribune 
report on Winn, which cited a 
California Department of Motor 
Vehicles worker, his driver's license 
was suspended on April 17 due to 
child support issues. In 1998, Winn 
was ordered to pay $280 a month 
for each of his two youngest chil-
dren, aged II and 13 , after racking 
up $8,400 in overdue payments, 
according to court records. 

However, Winn's statement 
implies that there is more to the 
story. 

"The information about my 
child support record is outdated 
and no longer factual or accu-
rate," Winn stated. "My child sup-
port payments are up-to-date and 
arrears have been cleared by the 
parents."

Four VCSD women's water

mate sendoff as the American 
Water Polo Coaches Association 
rewarded their efforts by naming 
them to the 2005 Division [[ A11-
Anlerican tea m. 

Driver Tobi Lyman, who led 
the TritOns this year with 57 
goa ls, was awarded Division II 
Player of the Year honors, becom-
ing the third UCSWlayer to 
receive the awar~ast four 
years. Uti li ty Courtney Clevenger, 
two-meter Lindsay Grossma n and 
junior goaltender Kaitlin Foe 
also received All-American selec-
tions. 11\ addition, UCS D head 
coach Larry Sanders was chosen 
as Coach of the Year by his fellow 
coaches. 

"As a top Division [J team and 
a top-20 team in the country, this 
is omething I expect because they 
are great players," Sanders said . 
"But it's a chance to show other 
teams that, despite being the only 
nonscholarship team in the top-
20, we have some quality athletes. 
" . It's a great honor. " 

One player Sanders felt 
deserved the honors but didn 't 
is the team's other graduat-
ing senior, driver and team cap-
tain Jessica Wong. According to 
Sanders, Wong exhibited maturity 
and control on both sides of the 
pool, leading the Tritons in assists 
and blocks this season, with 35 and 
13 , respectively. While these con-
tributions were critical to UCS D's

Lyman, who earned 57 goals , 
20 assists and 34 steals, tied 
Wong for the most quarters tal-
li ed over the season with 138. 
Lyman capped off her brief career 
as a T riton, having transferred 
from UC Irvine last season, by 
becoming the first UCSD driver 
in recent years to win Player of 
the Year honors. The two pre-
vious recipients in the last four 

yea rs - Emma Kudritzki in 2002 
and Dana Tucker in 2003 - both 
played as two-meters. 

"J wasn't expecting it, so that 
was a cool surprise, " Lyman said. 
"It was a big decis.ion for me to 
transfer, but I've had a great time 
in these last two years." 

Clevenger was another transfer 
who had a big impact in a short 
period of time, following Lyman

Former UCSD athletic 
director speaks out 

Sweet comments on athletic 
scholarships, Title IX, sexism 

Cyn City ~ 
Cynthia Chavez 

Former UCSD Athletic Director Judy Sweet was a keynote speaker and 
Title 1X panelist at the annual 
Association for Women in Sports 
Media Convention in downtown 
San Diego on May 28. Sweet, the 

CAA vice president for cham-
pionship and education services , 
served as UCSD's ath letic director 
from 1975 to 1999, and became 
one of the first women to lead a 
combined men's and women's ath-
letic program. 

"[ loved being at UCSD," Sweet 
said. "It has proll\ded me a wonder-
fu l opportunity to work at a strong 
academic institution that recog-
nized that physical activity was a 
good complement to educationa l 
experiences that male and female 
students had." 

As one of the first female lead-
ers in the male-dominated envi-
ronment of sports administration, 
Sweet fuced her share of challeng-
es. 

"In the early years of my tenure 
as director of athletics, there were 
individuals that were questioning 

whether it was appropriate to have 
a female in a nontraditional role," 
Sweet said. "1 could understand 
what the needs were for a men's 
program and my response to that 
was to show that J did understand 
and I was committed to providing 
positive experiences for both males 
and females." 

During Sweet's tenure, UCSD 
won the 1998 Sears Director's 
Cup Award as the most successful 
Division ill athletics program in 
the country. Since 1983, Sweet has 
served on more than 20 NCAA 
committees and became the first 
and - because of governance 
resrrucruring in 1997 - only 
female to serve as NCAA presi-
den t in 1991. She was also the first 
female to serve as NCAA secretary-
treasurer from 1989 through 1991. 

In 2000, a year after Sweet 
concluded her position as athletic 
director, UCSD moved to Division 
IT under current Athletic Director 
Earl W . Edwards, and became 
the only institution in the division 
to not give athletic scholarships. 
Despite the lad: of scholarships, 
the Tritons remained competi-
tive, eaming back-to-back national 
championships in women's soccer 
in 2000 and 2001.

Students urged to consolidate 
Loan interest likely to jump 60 percent in July 

8y CHRlmNE CLARK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Because interest rates on student loa ns will likely increase by nearly 60 per-
cent in July from their current 
levels, higher education advocates 
have recommended that students 
consolidate their loans by the end 
of June in order to lock in histori-
cally low interest rates. 

The current interest rate 
stands at 2.88 percent and is the 
lowest rate in the history of fed-
eral student loans. The interest is 
adjusted every July, and this year, 
economic experts predict that 
rates will increase by about 2 per-
cent after May's 91-day Treasury 
bill auction. 

"For most new and recent grad-
uates, ... [the) 91-day T-bill bond 
equivalent rate of 2.957 percent 
would send consolidation loan 
interest rates up to 4.75 percent 
and 5.3 75 percent, respectively," 
Ben Kiser, a spokesman for lender 
Nelnet, stated in an e-mail. 

Loan consolidation allows stu-
dents to combine various debts 
into one lump sum in order to 
make a single monthly payment at 
a fixed interest rate. 

"[Loan consolidation) takes all 
of your loans - for example, if 
you have Educaid and a Perkins 
Loan - and you put them aU 
together in one payment."UCSD 
Financial Aid Director Vincent 
De Anda said. "If you COJ15()li*

S2 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SUMMER KICKOFF SECTION 1\JESDAY, MAY 11, 2005 

Small villages in Bavaria's countryside offers rustic travel getaway 
Natural attractions provide ideal locations for camping, mountain climbing and hiking 

8y FAIIANNE FURMAN 
Staff Writer 

If Garmisch-Partenkirchen, 
Germany, were to be described in 
oneword,itwould be quaint. Much 
like a fairy-tale village, Garmisch 
is a setting of old-fashioned, 
flower-adorned cottages against a 
backdrop of blue, cloudless skies 
and green meadows of overgrown 
grass. Amidst the narrow, winding 
roads that feature more shoes and 
bicycles than cars, one can find 
hidden, family-owned cafes with 
thick wooden picnic tables situ-
ated under shaggy trees. 

In the Bavarian Alps of 
Germany, Garmisch is small and 
almost hidden. It is not considered 
a major district of Bavaria and 
would not be a main feature of a 
tourist's guidebook. It is this lack 
of popularity"that allows Garmisch 
to remain sepa rate from the indus-
trial setting of Munich, Bavaria 's 
ca pi tal, and to preserve such clean 
and undeveloped open space. 

While Garmisch is a peaceful 
district, it is nowhere near boring. 
In the summer it atuacts visi-
tors interested in hiking, cam ping, 
cycling or mountain climbing. 
In fact, it is home to Zugspitze, 
Germany's highest mountain , 
standing9,7 18feethigh. For those 
interested in rock climbing, the 
mountain provides several differ-
ent climbs, and for the less-rugged 
tourist , a cogwheel railroad and 
cable cars lift visitors to the top. 
At the very peak of the mountain 
is Hotel Zugspitze, a fairly expen-
sive, four-star hotel resembling 
an enlarged version of Garmisch's 
typical chateaus. For penny-pinch-
ing students, Garmisch provides 
seven campgrounds at the foot of 
Zugspitze, along with inexpen-

sive family-owned guesthouses. 
Camping or staying in a one-star 
guesthouse at the bottom of the 
mountain not only saves money 
but also provides a more down-to-
earth experience of Garmisch (not 
to mention one without altitude 
headaches). In addition, just a 3-
km bus ride away from Garmisch 
is theJugendherbergen youth hos-
tel , which costs only 20 euros a 
night. 

Second to the Zugspitze 
Mountain , Garmisc h boasts 
another must-see natural attrac-
tion: the Partnach Gorge. The 
gorge, overwhelming enough 
to be featured as one of Frodo's 
obstacles in "Lord of the Rings," 
is a 262-foot-high limestone giant, 
splashed with waterfalls and cut 
by a choppy white river. Natural 
tunnels and passages have been 
carved into the limestone, pro-
viding tourists with a brisk break 
from the summer heat as they 
walk along the river and behind 
the waterfalls. 

After a long day of hiking, 
camping, mountain climbing or 
exploring the Partnach Gorge, 
food becomes a top priority. 
Fortunately, Garmisch is full of 
inexpensive, private restaurants 
and cafes. While German cui -
sine is often stereotyped as heavy, 
meaty and highly caloric, there 
are plenty of lighter opti ons to be 
found, including vegetable soups, 
sa ndwiches on German rye bread 
(whi ch is just not the same in the 
United States) and creative crepes. 
One restaurant in particular is 
popular among American tour-
ists due to its eye-catching name: 
Bistro Mukkefuck . The restaurant 
is named after a type of inex-
pensive coffee that was served in 
Germany during wartime and eco-

nomic depressions, but the restau-
rant has utilized its controversial 
name to attract English-speaking 
tourists, selling souvenirs such as 
T-shirts that displ ay the word in 
question in bold letter . 

Oes pi te its uniqu ely titled 
restaurants, Garmisch remains a 
peaceful, earthy retreat, and is 
definitely not a party town. The 
district would most likely disre-
gard the needs of a tourist looking 
to stay out all night - unless of 
course that tourist is interested in 
drinking German beer with older 
Garmisch natives in a pub blast-
ing with the horns of live polka 
music. The onl y contradictions

Music" feel are the lively German 
and Irish pubs that host singing 
patrons and world-famous beer. 
The city does have a handful of 
discotheques where young people 
gather to dance, but most are on

are not highly regarded by natives. 
In general, Garmisch is more a

Getting to Garmisch from 
the Munich International Airport 
requires a two-hour train ride 
from the airport terminal - with 
one train change - that leads 
ri ght into the center of the city. 
The view on the train ride alone 
is like a sJideshow of mountains, 
wild animals and colors right alit 
the passenger's window, making 
the two hours feel more like two 
minutes . While in Garmisch,

visitor's card that all ows them to 
ride the loca l buses free of charge.

not free, is also an effective way

Experts urge preparation in job interViews 
Interview etiquette essential in securing summer jobs 

By LAURA CANTER 
Staff Writer 

It is almost summer, which means 
time for students to start think-
ing about that coveted summer job 
- not to mention that graduation 
is quickly approaching for many 
seniors. Accordingly, it is time to 
start gearing up for job applications 
and preparing for interviews. Even 
though interviews can be intimidat-
ing, being prepared and confident 
in yourself is often enough to elimi-
nate anxiety. 

Torrey Hood, a junior at Revelle 
College, has a laid-back approach to 
job interviews. 

"Interviews are not intimidat-
ing for me," she said. "You can't be 
scared. Just go in with an attitude 
like you are going to have a casual 
conversation." 

Hood has already locked in her 
summer job, continuing her employ-
ment from last summer at Mountain 
Building Supply in Quincy, Calif., 
her hometown, where she will exe-
cute accounting, customer-service 
and employee-relations duties. 

Prior to an interview, it is always 
best to prepare a good resume, 
especially one that documents ones 
experiences. Customize the resume 
in such a way that it is targeted 
toward the particular desired posi-
tion. This indicates that you have 
researched the job you are applying 
for. 

"It is important to research the 
company," said Craig Schmidt, a 
Career Services Center adviser. 
"Reference [the] research in a 
brief sentence in the cover letter to 
express knowledge of the company. 
Include something that makes it 
stand out." 

to perform in an interview. Experts 
recommend that students practice 
responding to questions out loud in 
front of a camera. Employers look 
for candidates who have the ability 
to communicate effectively. 

"Those who can project poise 
and confidence in an interview have 
a better chance of getting the job 
- even those who are introverted 
and quiet," Schmidt said. 

Not only is it imperative to have 
an impressive resume and to be 
fully prepared for the interview, it 
is doubly important to know what 
not to do. One of the first mistakes 
students make is in not being able 
to back up their claims with proof 
or examples, such as transcripts or 
reference letrers. 

"Employers like examples," 
Schmidt said. "Have evidence and 
proof to document those skills." 

Students not only fail to provide 
a reasonable amount of verification 
a bout themselves, but some students 
try to negotiate their salaries during 
the interview. This is inappropri-
ate because an interview does not 
indicate that the job is guaranteed. 
Negotiations should be saved for 
when a job offer has been made; at 
that time, let the employer bring up 
the issue of salary first. 

Further interview gu idelines 
include wearing conservative attire 
and using a good, firm handshake 
when being introduced to the inter-
viewer, as well as using eye contact, 
a smile and the employer'S name. 
Always know the employer's name 
and how to pronounce it - call 
ahead to get the correct pronun-
ciation if it is likely to present a 
challenge.

Even with an improved job mar-

the resume is top-notch due to such 
a competitive process. 

Everything depends upon a

Credit card debt poses risk for 
uninformed college students 

Lenders use tricks, offers of freebies to 
snag new freshmen entering college 

By JESSICA FOIREm. 
The Post (Ohio U.) 

(U-WIRE) ATHENS, Ohio - As the 
school year comes to a close, seniors worry 
about more than graduation and finding a 
job - millions of them across the nation are 
drowning in thousands of dollars in credit 
card debt. 

The average college senior, according to 
2001 statistics, graduates with around $3,300 
in credit card debt, said Ohio University 
sociology professor Deb Thorne. That 
amount is more than three and a half times 
the 1990 figure, when the average college 
senior graduated with about $90() in credit 
card debt. 

If a student has $3,000 in credit card debt 
at an 18-percent interest rate - the average 
- and makes the minimum monthly pay-
ment, it will talee him or her at least 22 years 
to pay it off. Thorne said. 

Ninety-six percent of college students 
have a credit card by their senior year, 
Thorne said, and seniors carry an average of 
six credit cards. 

Most college students get into debt trou-
ble when credit card companies visit cam-
puses with promises of free food or clothing 
in exchange for signing up for a credit card, 
according to Thorne. Many students will 
sign up for a card just to get the free gift, 
not realizing the implications of owning the 
credit card. 

"That will be the most expensive slice 
of pizza or pita sandwich that you will ever 
have," she said. 

Many students who sign up think they can 
JUSt cut the card up when it arrives, which is 
not true. 

"Cutting up a card does not close the 
account, which means the open account will 
appear on your credit report," Thorne said. 

Students' responsibility may be questioned 
when they have open accounts on credit 
reports, especially by potential employers 
who may examine the reports. 

Ohio University graduate student Rachel 
Hoag said that most students are nO! aware 

of some of the other ramifications of signing 
up for a credit card as part of a giveaway. 

"I think students need to be careful 
because your information can get sold to a 
lot of different places," Hoag said. "It's not 
worth a free T-shirt." 

Thorne said that some college students 
get into credit trouble when they exploit a 
card they had no initial intention of using. 

"Many students get one and don't read 
the fine print," Thorne said, which means 
students using cards may not have any Imowl-
edge of the interest rates, fees or restrictions 
they may be charged. 

Credit card companies create fees and 
special charges, such as a 20-percent inter-
est on cash advances from ATMs, to charge 
cardholders as much as possible, Thome 
said. 

Ohio University senior Matthew Falk, 
who is about to graduate, said that, unlike 
many of his peers, he understands the fine 
print that comes with a credit card. 

"My mom is a banker," he said, "so shes 
taught me to read that stuff. I Imow a lot 
of people don't, though. I don't think most 
people pay attention to it." 

Thome said that credit cards could be an 
excellent way for students to establish credit, 
provided they are financially ready to take on 
the responsibility. 

"Unless you can pay that credit card off at 
the end of every month, you have no business 
using it," she said. 

Ohio University senior Andrea Schraw 
said that she opened her first credit card last 
year, one that she shared with her mom. 

"I got it to develop my own credit," 
Schraw said. "Once I got that, I stopped 
using it." 

Thorne said the beSt way college students 
can use credit cards to establish credit is 
to open a card with a low credit limit, buy 
something they can afford and then pay the 
entire balance at the end of every month. 

If a student ends up wi th credit card 
problems, there are not many options to get 
Oijt of debt. The best solution, she said, is to 
create a strict budget and stick to it.

TUESDAY. MAy " .1005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SUMMER KICKOFF ECTION 

Loans: Some lawmakers oppose fixed rates Osteria Romantica 
continued from page S I 

lawmakers, who say it is cost-
ing the government too much 
money. 

Republ icans on the House 
Education Workforce Committee 
believe that loan consolidation 
should not allow students to 
have a permanently fixed interest 
rate, according to the committee 
majority's press secretary Alexa 
Marrero. 

Part of the Higher Education Act 
reauthorization, backed bycomrnit-
tee Chair Rep. John Boehner (R-
Ohio), proposes to repeal the fiXed 
interest rate offered to students 
who consolidate their loans and to 
replace it with a variable rate. 

"The biggest change [in the 
proposal] is in the interest rate 
structure: Stlldent loans are pro-
vided on a variable interest rates, 
but consolidation lets borrowers 
lock in interest rates," Marrero 
said. "The consolidation loan 
program was to allow borrow-
ers to consolidate loans in order 
to ettend repayment; it was not 
meant to [be used] as a tool to 
secure interest rates." 

Marrero said that a fixed inter-
est rate puts students at risk of 
locking in a higher interest rate 
then the variable proposal, under 
which student rates on outstanding 
loans would fluctuate with market 
conditions. 

"The bill does nothing but [pro-
pose] to continue to use the same 
variable rate structure," Marrero 
said. "Borrowers can lock in the 
interest rates, but if interest rates 
decline, students can lock in a 
lower rate." 

In addition, Marrero said that 
loan consolidation offered at a fixed 
interest rate is taking away money 
from other potential student-aid 
programs, because the government 
has to pay the difference on loans 

that students consolidate at a fixed 
interest rate if it is lower than the 
market interest. 

"Consolidation is going to limit 
funding to undergraduate students 
because graduate students usually 
take out more loans," Marrero said. 
"Chairman Boehner is trying to 
focus on expanding college access 
opportunity [tol lower- and mid-
dle-income students." 

However, De Anda said that 
although fixed interest rates may 
cost the government money, loan 
consolidation is beneficial for stu-
dents. 

Still, students need to be aware 
that consolidation is not without 
risk, according to National Council 
for Education Loan Programs 
spokeswoman Shelly Repp. 

If students apply to consolidate 
their loans during their grace peri-
od - the six months after gradu-
ation when students don't have to 
repay their loans - they run the 
risk of forfeiting that grace period 
unless they are approved for defer-
ment, she said. 

"You may be giving up some 

THIS SUMMer ..• 

SOCial 

benefits, such as the six-month 
grace period," Repp said. "Also, 
you could lock into a high inter-
est rate, but 2.88 percent is pretty 
darn low." 

Though students may some-
times get stuck with unfavor-
able rates through consolidation, 
California Public Interest Research 
Group Higher Education Advocate 
Merriah Fairchild said it is unlikely 
that the current rates pose any 
worry to students. 

"Right now, since it is a fixed-
rate loan consolidation, students 
could lock into the lowest rate it 
has ever been," Fairchild said. "It 
is likely the lowest it will ever be. 
I don't think there are any draw-
baclcs. " 

Debates between Republicans 
and Democrats and student-advo-
cate groups on loan consolidation 
have contributed to the stalling of 
the Higher Education Act reau-
thorization . Though it is sup-
posed to be renewed every five 
years, the act has been held up 
on the Senate floor for the past 
several years.

"The more friendly and honest 
you are, the berter off you'll be," 
Hood said. "You can't be fake." 

In this situation, the firs t impres-
sion is very important: It creates a 
halo effect that is carried through-
out the interview. Talk about ski lls 
that fit the position, and when given 
the opportunity to ask questions, 
ask about the most important result 
that should be accomplished by the 
person who obtains the position. 
Then list the slci lls and experience 
you have that will make that hap-
pen. 

Not following up after the inter-
view is another huge mistake . At 
the end of the interview, ask when 
to expect a phone call about the 
position being filled. If there is no 
callback after the expected time, 
call to re-emphasize your interest 
in the position. Always call and

Deerhoof, Andrew Bird, Xiu Xiu, 
Out Hud, Dungen. 

This year, Lollapalooza doesn't 
come to you; you go to it. Featuring 
a huge lineup, this could be the year 
that reminds us that Perry Farrell 's 
(who's he again?) music festival still 
kicks a fair amount of ass.

24, Grant Park, Chicago, 1II .: $11 5

Walkmen, M83 , the D andy Warhols, 
Tegan and Sara, the Warlocks. 

For those in the San Diego area 
during the summer, festi vals exist 
that are less than a 20-minute drive 
from your house. Radio station 94/9 
kicks off its Independence Jam, fea-
turing no less than two good bands, 
at the always refreshing (but steep!) 
SDSU Open Air Theatre. 

94/9 Miller Lite Independence 
Jam: June 18, SDSU Open Air 
Theatre: $24: Pinback, Nada Surf, 
Raveonettes, Kasabian, Rocket 
From the Crypt. 

Of course, the cream of the 
crop of San Diego music events, 
Street Scene, has moved out of the 
Gaslamp and into the hot and ugly 
parking lot of Qualcomm. Though 
they got the location wrong, the 
lineup is boasted to be the best ever. 
Look at it. They're not wrong. 

San Diego Street Scene: July 29 
and July 30: Qualcomm Stadium 
parking lot: $65 for 2 days, $45 for 
single-day: the IGllers, the Pixie , 
the White Stripes, Social Distortion, 
Snoop Dogg, 311 , Black Eyed Peas, 
Garbage, Flaming Lips, Method

Molly, Death Cab For Cutie, Hot 
Hot Heat, Rise Against, Louis XIV, 
Autolux, the Locust. 

!fyou find a trip to Mediterranean 
Spain to be in your destiny, the 
Bennicissim Festival is four days 
of hedonism, indie rock, and dirty 
dancing. Keep your wineskin full 
and your Castilian sharp, and you 
may just end up with the story that 
trumps all of your friends ' "bong-
load at Bonnaroo" tales. Practice 
your British accent, or you may 
find yourself in a gutter with "Fuck 
Bush" tattooed somewhere you real-
ly don't want it to be.
