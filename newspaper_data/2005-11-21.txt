Regents 
pass exec 

• pay raises 
By YAsHA SHARMA 

Staff Writer 

The UC Board of Regents 
approved what it ca lled "modest" 
annual merit increases for senior 
management officials on Nov. 19, 
despite questions of unreported 
cash compensation given to top 
executives raised by recent articles 
in the San Francisco Cbronicle. 

Payroll records obtained by the 
Chronicle show forms of compen-
sation aside from salary totaling 
$871 million in bonuses, reloca-
tion packages and various other 
fonns of cash payments .over the 
past year. The figures had not 
been previously disclosed to the 
public. The bulk of the last year's 
extra compensation, roughly $599 
million , went to more than 8,500 
employees who each received at 
least $20,000 over their regular 
sa larie~, and the amount was more 
than enough to cover the near 79-
percent hike in student fees over 
the past five years. 

C Students ssociation 
President Anu Joshi aid it wa~ 
possible that the lack of transpar-
ency was intentional. 

"1 think that [the Board of 
Regents] know that California 
families are struggling because the 
UC isn't affordable," she said. "So 
they do not want to disclose that 
they are increasi ng salaries of the 
top executives." 

J oshi also said that she did not 
think that students would be both-
ered by the pay hikes as long as 
they did not come at the expense of 
higher student fees. UC PresiJent 
Robert C. Dynes justified the sal-
a ry increases 0 f a bour 2.5 percen t 

' I S necessary to mai ntain the qual ity 
of the university. 

"uc must be able to o ffer com-
petitive compensation packages in 
o rder to recruit 3Jld retain the 
ca liber of talent we need to keep 
UC and its contributions to soci-
ety strong," he sta ted in a press 
release. "While compensation o r 
benefits for certain employees may 
look high or inappropriate to some, 
they re flect very real marketplace 
demands and still continue to lag 
the ma rket in many instances."

THE SRT SHUTDO 

Ratcliff puts council on spot 
SRTV must meet conditions before return 

Greg Dale/Guardian 
Book talll: Acting Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff issued a list of requirements with which tne AS. 
Council must comply before the SRTV signal is reaaivated. One demand is the formation of a program review board.

A uniting buzz ha~ emanat-
ed around the A.. ouncil and 
Student-Run Television lately. 
Following the council' shutdown 
of the station and the administra-
tion's ubseq uent refusal to reacti-

vate the signal days later, the call 
of unity against higher powers 
could be hea rd on many student 
leaders' lips. 

" It shouldn 't be students 
fighting students anymore," .S. 
President Christopher weeten 
aid at an SRTV meeting on 

ov. 8. "The target should be the 
administration. " 

While "the administration" has 
been the nebulous temlused by vir-
tually all students involved, there is 

one name that has been attached to 
all memos sent to Sweeten regard-

Vice Chancellor of tudent Life 
Gary. R. Ratcliff, who iS~lIed a list

The $7.2 million project to 
reconstruct niversity H ou e, the 
chancellor's future residence, is 
back on track afte r a year of unsuc-
cessfUl private funding efforts and 
will use about $800,000 of campus 
funding. 

C President Robert C. Dynes 
commissioned the reconstru c-
tion of the house a fter a report 
in summer 2004 found that the 
property, appraised at $ 12 mil-
li on, wa not fit to live in and was 
built on anc ient archaeological 
remains. The project was meant 
to be funded mostly through pri-
vate sources, with the Office 
of the President pledging about 
$1 million. 

However, in spring 2005, for-
mer Vice Chancellor of External 

Hairs James M . Llngley 
announced that' a six-month effort 
to raise donations to construct a 
new house was unfruitful , forci ng 
ucor to put the property up for 
sa le . 

Since then , UCOP ha .. 
allowed the university to con-
tinue fund raising, culminating in 
an announcement la~t week that 
sufficient private funds had been 
secured to save the property. 

The gifts, totaling 4.9 mil-
lion, come from a total of nine 
donors, according to Associne

Safe Rides use lagging after budget boost 
By JESSICA HOR'lON 

. Staff Writer 

After years of drastica lly exceed-
ing its budget, Safe Rides, a popular 
AS Council-tun service that pro-
vides stranded students with a free 
ride home on the weekends, now 
appears to have more money than 
it can spend. 

The A.S. Cowlcil voted to boost 
the program's annual funding from 

17,000 to $27 ,000 last May to pre-
vent it from mnning in the red as 
it ha~ in the past. Ln previous years, 

the council was forced to repeatedly 
draw from budget reserve mid-year 
to keep the service operational. 

Although the budget hike 
diverted funds away from o ther 
student activities, the council felt 
that it was w':l rth prioritizing a 
program that enhanced tudents ' 
health and safety, according to A.S. 
Commissioner of Student Services 
Maurice Junious.

"We recognized that snldents 
are going to drink and PUl them-
selves in bad situations," J unious 
said. "They should be able to count 
on their school to help them out 
of that situation so they don 't hurt 
themselves or omebody else." 

t the time, the council thought 
it was sti ll providing les money than 
the program needed. However, this 
year only 739 students h,lVe regis-
tered to lise Safe Rides, compared 
to 1, -53 by the end of last year.

Scientists predict 

global water shortage 
Global warming will cause severe 

water shortages when high tempera-
tures melt glaciers and large packs of 
snow around the world, researchers 
at Smpps Institution of Ocea~raphy 
and the University of Washington 
argued In a new paper published in 
the saentllic JOumal Nature. 

The study's authors mapped out 
several scenariOS, one in which Tim 
Barnett, an 510 researcher, found that 
manmade greenhouse gases lead to 
warmer climates, Those rising tem-

Report: Online 
education on the rise 

An annual study of education 
on the I nterne~ titled 'Growing by 
Degrees: found that online teach-
Ing has become a major part of the 
mainstream enVIronment in higher 
education. 

The study reported that 65 
percent of schools offering gradu-
ate face-te-face courses also <:lffer 
graduate courses online, while 63 
percent of schools offering in-person 
undergraduate instruction also offer 
undergraduate courses online. In 
addition, the study's authors found 
that about 50 percent of all institu-
tions plan to use online educa· 
tlon as an important component 
of their long-term teaching strategy. 
However, the study also reported 
that smaller, private and nonprof-
It universities were less likely to

all universities, overall online enroll-
ment Increased from 1.98 million in 
2003 to 2.35 million in 2004. 

UCSD, Egypt partner 
in disability project 
The UCSD School of Medicine, 

In conjunction with an Egyptian 
research institute, is exploring the 
causes of mental disability in chil-

dren. The Human Genetics and 
Genome Research Division at the 
National Research Center in cairo is 
tackling a genetic disorder prominent 
in Egypt caused by the large number 
of first-cousin marriages throughout 
the region. The in·breeding leads 
to an abnormally large number of 
autosomal recessive mental retarda-
tion among children. 

Joseph Gli eson, assistant pro· 
fessor of neurosciences and director 
of the UCSD Center for Cerebellar 
Malformations, will lead a team in 
the diagnosis and study of fami-
lies of chi ldren with Inherited brain 
development disorders. 

Gleeson and fellow research-
ers VISited the Egyptian Institute 
In January. The first stage of the 
project IS expected to be complete 
by 2006, after Egyptian research-
ers visit UCSD to study methods 
of genetic analysis for use on their 
patients, 

College survey shows 
low approval of Bush 

College students have the same 
sentiment concerning President 
George W. Bush as the rest of 
the nation, according to a survey 
conducted by Harvard University's 
Institute of Politics. 

The poll showed a historical~ 
low approval rating for the presiden~ 
with 4 1 percent of college students 
saying they are pleased with Bush's 
performance, down six points from 
seven months ago. 

In addition, 52 percent of college 
students said they trust the United 
Nations to do the right thing all or 
most of the' time, While only 39 
percent said the same about the 
president. 

Students' skepticism stretches to 
other political figures as well. the 
study found. Almost 25 percent of 
college students said that the ethical 
conduct of members of Congress has 
dedined in recent years. Meanwhile, 
70 percent of those surveyed said 
that they believe elected officials are 
motivated by selfish reasons, which 
is a 12-point increase from last year. 

In the same vein, 72 percent of 
college students surveyed said that 
modern politics have become too 
partisan, and 64 percent said that 
the political tone in the nation's capi-
tal has become too negative.

House: University to use 
about $800K of campus funds 

continued from page f 
Vice Chancellor of University 
Communications Stacie Spector. 

"We presently have a leader-
ship group comprised of nine 
donors reflecting four gifts at the 
$1 million level , one gift at the 
$500,000 level and four gifts at 
the $100,000 level," she stated in 
an e-mail. "Additionally, several 
solicitations are outstanding. ~ 

UCOP, which has suspended 
the sale of the property, has com-
mitted $1.45 million, which leaves 
the university $SSO,OOO shy of the 
estimated cost for construction, 
according to Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management and 
Planning John A. Woods: 

About $SOO,OOO will ' come 
from campus funds, ~epending on 
the outcome of leftover fundrais-
ing requests, Spector said. 

But any amount of money com-
ing from UCOP or the campus is 
too much, according to Denise 
Mitchell-Cuignan, vice president 
of the Coalition of University 
Employees. 

"My opinion is that if they 
get private funding, I really don't 
care," she said. "But if the fund -
ing comes from the state, then it 
comes from our pockets." 

In addition, the university is 
straying from initial promises that 
the project would not dip into 
campus funding, Carignan said. 

"Why are we using our own 
campus funding? They swore up 
and down that this was a privately 
funded project," she said. "I think 
we should hold their feet to the 
nre, too, because that's what they 
do to us. And $800,000 could do 
a lot of things for students and 
faculty at this university." 

However, UCSD does not 
have much choice in the matter 
of housing the chanceIJor, Spector 

said. 
"Uni versity of California 

[regents') policy requires that UC 
chancellors live in the University 
House," she stated. "As is the case 
at all UC campuses, the UCSD 
facility serves as both a private 
residence and a space where many 
public events are hosted. It is a 
requirement, not an option." 

While Mitchell-Carignan 
understands the requirement, it 
offers her and other employees 
little comfort, she said. 

"For San Diego and La Jolla, 
$ 1.4 million and $SOO,OOO is not 
that much," she said. "And yes, it 
is part of what's required of uni-
versity chancellors to be near their 
university, so it's a catch-no But it 
doesn't mean we have to like it. " 

The campus is in the pro-
cess of planning for the house, 
using recommendations from 
the University House Building 
Advisory Committee, which has 
met in the last several months. 

The committee is in the final 
stages of developing a non-site-
specific plan to give the chancellor 
"adequate residential and public 
meeting spaces," Woods stated in 
a press release. 

"Once [the plan is) complete, 
the BAC will turn its attention 
to other planning phases, which 
include a site analysis of the La 
Jolla Fanns property, completion 
of an architectural design and an 
environmental impact review," 
Woods stated. 

Although preliminary work-
group reviews had recommended 
tearing down the current house 
to reduce costs, the BAC will 
reconsider saving portions of the 
facility, Spector said.

Pay: UCSD prof among highest paid in UC 
continued from page I 

Some of the compensation 
figures are reflective of one-time 
payments and do not necessar-
ily suggest ongoing compensation, 
the release stated. However, the 
university should have a certain 
degree of transparency when it 
comes to salary levels, according 
to Dynes_ 

"\Vhile the Chronicle omitted or 
mischaracterized some important 
facts , the stories also point out the 
need for us to consider whether we 
need to improve some of our pub-
lic disclosure policies and internal 
practices," Dynes stated in a letter 
to UC students. 

Robert: Weinreb, a professor in 
the UC D deparoneflt of ophthal -
mology, was ninth in a UC rankin g 
of highest paid employees, accord-
ing to a new UC Web site that 

tracks employee compensations. 
State funding provides a portion of 
Weinreb's salary, while awards in 
the form of contracts, grants and 
professional fees pay for the rest of 
his salary. 

A study on UC compensation, 
conducted by Mercer Consulting, 
found that current UC employee 
cash compensation is 15 percent 
below the comparative market 
level. However, the study did not 
take into account the one- time 
unreported payments disclosed by 
the Chronicle. 

On the basis of thc srudy, the 
regents also approved a university 
objective of bringing al l employees' 
compensation to a markct-com-
petitive range within 10 years. C 
employees this yea r arc receiving 
average 3.S-percent sa lary increas-
es, in addition to a proposed 4- per-

cent average increase for 2006-07. 
The regents postponed the third 
component of the plan, which 
would have used private funds ro 
supplement executive salaries. 

While Mercer's study used other 
"market-competitive" universities 
for comparison, many were well-

abuse of the service. The Clrds a Iso

the service each year. 

"Some people were using it like

who began keeping close records last 
year so that he could identify ways 
to make the service more efficient. 
"Some were still using it after they

Junious said the new rules are 
the main reason for the program's

"Now that we've placed limita-
tions on the service, people are less

Junious said. "We are learning to 
balance between providing srudents 
with a safety net and encouraging 
them to be more responsible."

The added hassle of applying for 
annual cards may also be responsible 
for the low number of students cur-
rently registered to use the ervice, 
Junious said. 

While the numbers are low, 
Junious said he expects them to 
increase as more srudents learn about 
the program throughout the year. [f 
this happens, program expenses are 
likely to rise proportionally. 

Malelci also overhauled the coun-
cil's contract with Cloud 9 to provide 
larger carrying capacity and longer 
driving distances for each nip, which 
was meant to reduce waiting times. 

Beca use future costs are hard to 
predict, the council does not plan 
to take action to reduce the service's 
funding until the budget is rene-
gotiated next spring, according to 
A.S. Vice President Finance Greg 
Murphy. 

Any un used money a I the end 
of thc yea r will be rerurned ro the 
council 's gcncrnl fund , where it can 
be reallocated the following yea r to 
other programs. 

"Since srudenrs use this scmce 
more than any of the others, I don't 
think it's a massivc sacri fi ce for now," 
Murphy said. 

Some cour.cilmember are 
relieved to see a program that has 
struggled in the past finally come 
out under budget. 

"The amount of money we put 
into it to make it run at its full capac-
ity - to provide a safe ride horne 
to any UCSD student who needs it 
- is worth it," Thurgood Marshall 
College Senior Senator Kate PiUon 
said.

A military riddled with gender stereotypes 
Women fighting alongside men would represen~ a feminist victory 

By GRACE FONG 
Contributing Writer 

For decades, women ha\'e worked to close the gender gap. While we have Illade great strides, the military is a 
\\ orld where timc churns at a vcry different 
pace. Though military women arc currently 
allowed to serve in ollcr 90 percent of all 
ca reer fields in the armed forces, they are sti ll 
harred frum combat. 

bat readiness the pivot.11 factor in excluding 
women? This is a brain against brawn argu-
mem: Ir has been scientifica lly proven 
that while women may not be able to 
build as much muscle as men, the y 

and arc just as capable of learning the weapon 
techniques taught to an in fantryman. In fact, 
when it comes to fi ghter pilots, women's bod-
ies actua lly hold a physiological advantage 
over men's. Grdvitational forces push down 

heart to pump blood to the brain, hut since 
women have 3 smaller body mass and there-
fore a shorter distance to t ravel between the 
heart and the brain, thei r bodies are better 
able to counteract dlese G-forces.

Hut what docs serving in combat rcally 
mean? In this new age of war, combat bound-
aries C;ln nQ longer be as easi ly defined as tlley 
"erc ill \·\ 'orld \ \'ar II or in iemam. "Every 
day soldiers, includ ing women, come under 
enemy fire," the Nf'lJ! l'01'k TilllfS ~a id of the 
curre;ll Inlq \ Var. p until on ly a couple 

dC(~ldes ago, \\omCIl typica lly held nursing

Ix: found crossing into combat .<Ones. Forry 
thousand ~omen in tile Gu lf \Var served in 
key positions, fonning an important suppOrt 
huttre.,s for the other troops in the theater. 
\ \'olllcn In the Gulf\Var, a stated hy retired 
U.S. Air Force Capt. Barbara \ Vilson, "new 
refucling plancs, Oc\\' troop transport aircraft

eters, acccpted the surrender of I raqi soldiers 
,lIld ~lIbsequentl )' pulled guard duty. \ omen 
\\ere taken pri oner and some lost their lives 
in the Gulf - i that not being in combat?" 

The Dcparollent of Defense prohibits 
\\()lIlcn from particip:lting in "di rect ground 
combat," but what exactly docs this con-
qirllle and why can't women be allowed in 
dlese positions? 

In 1948, dle W()llIen '~ Amled Services 
Integration Act allowed women to join the 
Navy, Navy Re erves and the Marine COIl)S. 
Since the end of the male draft in 1973, the 
proportion of women in the milimry has 
climhed from 1.6 perccnt to 14.5 percent in 
2005. l.)cspite these IIlC3;Ures, it took nearly 
40 year~ for dle firH milit;lry woman to make 
a parachute jump and over 50 years ,for the 
fir .. t woman to cOlllmand a Navy ship. It is 
,afc to say that dle progress of women in dle 
military i., ' teady, but also ~Iow. 

There arc a number of differcnt argu-
ments that politicians usc to explain why 
\\C)lllcn should not allo\\ed in direct combat 
positions. The most common argument is 
thal women arc !>imply nOl as physica lly 
, trung a., mcn. \ \ 'hile there is a , mall per-
centage of women that could Illeet and po;-

ror llIen, 1110 t "mild still lag behind. 

Hilt i., the physic,,1 component of COIll -

used to explain why females are 
better left in support positions. 
Some of the arguments include: 
Since men have an "inherent nature 
to protect women" they will dote 
on the women if they are wounded; 
women will disrupt the male bond-
ing; and women will be more sus-
ceptible to sexual assault by both 
their comrades and by the enemy if 
they are captured .. 

Since these arglllllents are 
results of ge nder stereotyping, 
they are always subject to change. 
T hroughout history, women have 
proved to be an integral part of 
our military and can only serve to 
better the forces by their involve-
ment in combat. Today there are 
" lioness" grou ps in 1raq - all -
female uni ts that spea k with the 
Lraqi women and deal with gender-
sensitive isslles. 

It doesn 't seem to be a ques-
tion of whether women are able 
to fulfill thcse "combat" positions, 
but whether thc military and our 
society are ready to accept this and 
how, exaedy, we should integrate 
them into our combat forces. The 
hype followin g Jessica Lynch 's cap-
ture on March 23, 2003, shows, 
without a doubt, th at our society 
weighs the death and eapwre of a 
female soldier more heavily than 
that of her male counterparts. 

Gender inequality and th e ste-
reotypes that stem from it are 
conditi oned by our society. Th e 
country is not ready to sce women 
die en masse because, despite the 
feminisl movement, we still see 
fema les as dainty, more vulner-
able, and possibly morc incom -
petent. I f we arc go ing to furd1er 

. I integ rate womcn into combat 
positions, the military necds to 
develop an action plall'that utili z-
es womcn for all their strengths. 
Over time, with the slow incorpo-
ration of females into our' mi litary, 

Michael Sung/Guardian the evo lution and elim ination of 
gender stereotypes llIight triclJe clown 
into American society at large. 

Cultural organization.s unduly influence campus politics' 
Hats 
off 

Vladimir Kogan 

B cfore his 1953 convi.ction for tax evasion, lobbyist Artie Sa mish was the "Secret Boss 
of Cali fornia," running the state 

LCf~isLlturc through well-placed 
cash, the motl)er's milk of poli= 
tics. t UCS D, cultura l organiza-
tums under the Student Affinn3tive 
Action Committee umLrelia run 
campus politi~ in much the same 
\"1), though dle money Oows the 
other way: S AC doc~ the ~uckjin g, 
and the A.S. Council hand~ over the 
milk. 

Until thc Sludcnts Fir~t! political 
m.lchine ICII ,Ipart hl'>l ),ear, SAA . 
or!,,,, played a cnlci~1 role in t':l mpu~ 
dct'lJon~, es~ent iall y hand-picking 
the ~1X:Clfic cdndidates that ran on 
tllC SFI sbtc. But their might con-
tinucs; ill la~t year's election, not a 

single one of tile three slates that 
competed for ca mpuswide offices 
dared to oppo~e U1C IBO,OOO-a-year 
S C-haeked refcrendum to fund 
student-initiated outreach. ( Inc ref-
erendum fai led.) 

To this day, SAAC retains a 
nonvoting se<lt on U1C A.S. Counci l 
and is the only sludent or!,'':tniza-
tion that gets representation on the 
Univcrsity Centers Advisory Board, 
though it's not quite d ear why cul-
ulre orgs - instead of, say, G reeks 
or the College Repuhlit'ans - have 
a larger vested stake in how sUldent-
funded facil ities fUllction. 

The suckling itsclf comes in witll 
the outreat:h funding. Every year, the 
A.S. Council appropriates approxi-
ma tely $40,000 to programs like 
high school conferences, designed 
to increase thc nlllnber of underrep-
resented students on ca mpus; SAAC 
argo; nm many of th ese programs. 

The procc is supposed to work 
in the fo llowing way: First, the spe-
cial SUlclent- lnitiated Outreach and 
Recnlionent Commission - com-
posed of mostly of AAC org rep-
resentatives - is supposed to draft 

a hudget, picking th e programs that 
receive outreach funding; next, the 
A.S. Council is supposed to review 
the budget, to make sure student 
funds arc being spent in the best 
way. 

1n practice, the second step 
doesn't happen, as became clear last 
month when th e council was sched-
uled to approve the SIORC bud-
get. Something was defini tely amiss 
when the actual budget that the A.S. 
Council' was supposed to be ratify-
ing was never ellen attached to the 
cOlLncil agenda. 

"1 don't feel like tllis is a COlll-
plete request - there isn't even 
an amount thcre," a dumbfounded 
Revell e College Senior SenatOr 
Rachcl Corell to ld other cOllncil-
members at tile timc. 

Fortunately, Vice President 
Finance Greg Murphy was on hand 
to explain the rules of rhe game to 
Corell. 

" IORC is something that we 
generally let them allocate on thei r 
OWll," Murphy said. "Whatever we 
approve, we just generally rubber 
stamp it." 

'Whilc members of Congress 
generally vote on legislation without 
actually reading it, ule A.S. Council 
lowers its standards a notch, voting 
on legislation without actually seeillg 
it. I n effect, not on Iy does the fox 
guard the chicken coop, but it docs 
so with the blessing and the "rubber 
stamp" of the famler. 

And there are reasons for treating 
outreach funding wim more scrutiny 
thcn other A.S. programs, not less. 

T he problem with outreach is 
that tllcre is absolutely no evidence 
to show that it works. Between 2002 
alld the end of this academic year, 
the A.S. Council will have spent 
$ 1%,000 in swdent activity fees to 
fund outreach. Ironically, between 
fa ll 2002 and this September, the 
nWllber of black swdents - the 
campus' mo t underrepresented 
group - admitted to UCSD actu-
all y fell from 330 to 313, despite an 
overall ri se in the number of admit-
ted freshmen . 

Groups that put on outreach 
programs generally defend them by 
showing data on the number of stu-
dents that attend. But there is abso-

lutely noway to tell if the attendees 
would have applied to UCSD any-
way, whedler tile}, attended the high 
school con ferences or not. 

1 f effectiveness were to be judged 
simply by usage rates, those herbal 
Viagra alternatives we keep getting 
e-maiJs about would be considered 
the new miracle drug. And there 
is as much science to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the supplements 
as there is showing the uccess of 
outreach. 

Last-year, Earl Warren College 
sophomore Matt Herrick, at the 
time the college'S freshman sena-
tor, dared to ask if students actually 
got any benefit out of the Asian and 
Pacific-Islander Student Alliance 
high chool conferencc. Such benefit 
is a requirement that must be met 
to receive funding from the Warren 
College Coullcil. (APSA is a SAAC ' 
member.)

doors were super-glued, his face was

Globalization doesn't deserve demonization Kogan: 
By DAVlD CERurn 

Contributing Writer 

H ere's an observation for the Zapatistas: Distributing flyers around UCSD 
with big pictures of masked men 
brandishing automatic weapons (or 
even dolls made out to look that 
way) with promises to "help those 
who arc resisting" against "the evil 
wrought by the powerful who on ly 
humilia ted us" might L'3USe some 
resenOllent in mericJ. In fact, it 
might make Americans scream "Ya 
Basra!" Indeed, enough. 

The Zapatistas are nQt AI Qacda 
nor the AI-Aqsa Martyrs, Lut dleir 
Ryer did a fantastic joh of making 
thc radica l left look like rab terror-
ists, which is a disservice. Full disclo-
sure: I only attended five minutes of 
thcir meeting (they were here ask-
ing for money). It conveys my erst-
while ignorance of this group that J 
asked, "What do you think of Norm 
Americall Free Trade Agreement?" 
which begot thc f.uniliar run-around 
of the protectioni t left. I lowever, it 
is worthwhile to debunk some of 
these point~, in general , not jusr as 
they arc made by the Zapatistas. 

Their response' was that all of 
th e land and wealth in Mexico 
is now being sucked up by a few 
powerful corporations. Citizens are 
being forced to live bnltish lives 
in Tllllqlliliadori/J (sweat shops). It 
was most tell ing rhat the people 
leading the discus~ion veered into 
generalir,;ttions: that this was what 

wa~ haplX!ning all over the world, 
in China and in Korea, too, tate-
ments which dmetailcd their nyer. 
But, a Nicholas K ri~tof of the 'I'lL' 
York Tilllf.r noted, sweatshop~ are 
one of the preferred wage sources in 
third-world countries, as they don 't 
involve constanr ~weat. As Paul 
Krugman wrote in Slnte, "global 
poveny is not something recenuy 
invented ~ r the benefit of lIlultina-

tional corpor.ltions," Disparities in 
wages existed long before advances 
in telecommunications, transporta-
tion and other technologies that 
finally made it profitable for busi-
nesses in developed. nations to use 
third-world labor. 

Specifically, NAITA has turned 
orm Amcrica right side up again. 

As the Conbrressional Budget 
Office, relying on U.S. Census 
Bureau data, notes, U.S. exportS 
to and imports frum Mexico have 
risen steadily over the past 15 years 
- trends that AITA reAeCted 
and reinforced rather than started. 
Thanks to MTA and, especially, 
[0 trends that were in placc long 
before, America is now running a 
trade defici t of 17 billion 31Ulually 

,,~th Mexico - a wealthy country is 
financing the growth of a poor one, 
as it should . rnle Mexican 7nllquilll,-
dirms pay a few dollars per day - and 
yet people come to Tijuana from 
other parts of Mexico seeking bettcr 
lives. There is still a sharp contrast 
at the Mexican border, but the influx 
of capital is starting to put pave-
ment and concrete where muddy 
dirt road once lay. TllCrc's room 
for debate on what the best ways 
arc to funnel the maximwll possible 
amolUlt of the capiell revcnue to the 

~orkcrs, but were mcrica to forc-
ibly close its borders to trade, the 
misery would doubtlessly deepen. 

"They're being forced to work 
in ~weat~hops, with chemicals . 
that makc their babies come out 
defonned!" carne another response 
to my quesoon. -I 'hi is undoubtedly 
mle; National Geographic once ran 
an :Irticle about industrial growth in 
China, ~howing a man whose hands 
were so burned by sulfuric acid that 
the ski n was peeling away in thick 
yellow Rakcs. , ome of these chemi-
cals arc proba bly teratogcns. 

Ilowever, when contrasted "ith 
U1C condiliom these people other-
wise endure (that were not crealed 

by globalization), the reasons people 
still take such jobs becomes more 
clear. Scwage runs through the 
streets in the colonias of Tijuana. 
Outhousc of rotting wood are the 
best sanitation available. Electricity 
is pir.lted by bending a fork in half 
and thro~ng it over lines that Illay 
fWl a mere eight feet overhead. 
Dogs are plentiful, as are the diseas-
es they carry. Strep throat is passed 
frOIll dogs as they lick the chi ldren, 
rabies is '3 persistent danger, and 
Acas and lice are everywhere. T he 
dirt floors of the houscs crawl with 
insects, and thc common adobe 
walls make homes for blood feeder 
insects that transmit Chagas's dis-
ease. Babies defonllecl by industrial 
chemicals arc a tragedy, but many 
babies bom at th is time of yeilr 
won't survivc the winter at all. 

Richard Rothstein's writing in 
Dissent magazine i a good example 
of the response to such arguments. 

pcalcing in regard to sweatshops 
in Chad, which he agrees benefit 
the population , he argues "it can't 
be inUlloral to ... pay a little more 
for apparel," and makes numerous 
arguments in favor of an interna-
tional minimum wage and labor 
laws. It would indeed be wonderful 
to be able to bring this sort of c1ean -
lines to developing and third-world 
countries, but as Krugman points 
out, multinational corporntions 
ha\'c on ly recently beglUl to usc 
third -world labor, while the advan-
tages of fi rst-world labor, rema i n 
fonllidable . Rothstein's o\\." obser-
vation - that there is considerable 
diversity :lInong dle wages of cven 
third-world countries - merely 
reneets U1C Fact tllat multinational 
coillorations arc oPlxlmll1istic in 
using chea p labor, not controlllJlg 
its sources. C hcap labor is the only 
thing that tllird ~orld developing 
economic C'an really offer; stabil-
ity, quality of worker., and existing-

infra~mlcnlre arc profound adV3n-

tages of developed economics. As 
Kristof pointed out last month in 
his Nnv YO/'k Times column, Niger 
attempted to enact labor laws for 
the benefit of its workers, but the 
results have seen high unemploy-
ment and a quiet fonll of abject 
poveny. 

The meetillg's anendecs made 
onc other argumcnt, specifically that 
Coca-Cola ordered the assassina-
tion of a number of union workers 
in Colombia (some later research 
revcaled that the alleged inci I cnt~ 
took place in the late 19905). It 
cannot be denied that corporations 
and their contractors arc capable of 
shady busine~ deals and outright 
criminal behavior. Ilowe\ l!r, there 
arc better ways to keep corporation~ 
honest and steadily improve the liv~ 
of the world 's indigent than to pro-
mote rebelliolls, to ~hut down trade, 
to boycott and to divcst. A better 
option is to IIpport intemational 
aid for things such as disease prcven-
tion and sanitation, or diplomatic 
efforts to maintain politicaJ stability 
in other countries. People who arc 
healthier can work harder for more 
income and begin to identify other 
discomforts in their lives, smrring 
with labor conditions. A healthy 
labor force and a stahle political cli-
mate - principle adv311tllges of the 
First World - are ul ingo; for which 
multinational corporatiom will pay 
much higher wages. 

Rather lhall ~upporring militants 
who make the American far left look 
like I Qaeda, lefr-wing AmeriC'an~ 
should he fighting for intemational 
aid and free trade, issllcs that con-

~ervative~ ha\'c taken the lead on 
and tepidly agrced to, re~pecti\'dy. 
There is much that ca n he done for 
tllC people whose hard labor docs 
indeed improvc our lives. 

But it's not to be accomplished 
by raging against the establishment, 
cutting off COlll lllerce or financing

Ratcliff: Head of student life opposes election

regulations - will provide both 
the council and university with the 
"front-end" protection that SRTV 
lacked, Ratcliff said. 

"I'm not trying to [raise] ques-
tions about quality of programming 
with the e requirements," he said. 
"It'll ... be members of the com-
munity making sure everything i 
within the station's charter, rules and 
regulations. We had the iruatioll 
where the station managers - one 
position - acted as the representa-
tives of the viewing commwlity." 

Irresponsibility on the part of the 
cowlcil and station managers, who 
had been asked by Commissioner 
of rudent Services MauriceJunious 
to review all shows starting ov. 3, 
forced the ultimarum, R;ltcliff said. 
An unscheduled segment featuring 
Earl Warren College senior Daniel 
Watts and John I\lluir CoJlege senior 
Steve York, who had hroadcast scv-
erdl pornographic rrograms before-
hand, spurrcd .S. Vice President 
Financc Greg Murphy, who was 
keeping watch at the station on 
Junious' behalf, to C:JII TritOn Cable 
to cut the ration's 5ignal. The con-
frontation that ensued bctween 
cOlLllcilmcmbcrs and RTV mem-
bers out~ide of the station \Va rca-
son enough to keep the statiun off 
the air, Ratcliff said. 

While Murphy and Watts have 
denied all claims d1at any physit.1 
confrontation took place, a mere 
standoff in front of SRTV shows 
d13t dlC council d<>\!s not have the 
resources to maintain its own sta-
tion, Ratcliff said. 

"1 couldn't, in good conSGience, 
let the station come back on air 
because I, [along) with many o ther 
people, were concerned about the 
station after that incident," he said. 
"We didn't want to see stakeouts at 
the station everyday just to en force 
their own rules and. regulations." 

It was the last 'option, Ratcliff 
said, to take the situation out of stu-
dents' hands, bur requiring review 
of progmms prior to airing will 
clear many of the headaches caused 
by York'5 shows, which included a 
segment with Thurgood Marshall 
College Senior Senator Kate Pillon 's 
face superimposed over an adult-

film actress. 
"J know of 60 srudents so far 

who have asked their fees that go 
to SR'lV be refunded because of 
Steve York's airings," Ratcliff said. 
"The council needs to get its house 
in order. It has the cart before the 
horse. It needs to have a charter with 
clear rules and regulations, effective 
controls and accountabi lity for pro-
ducers and station managers." 

However, a pro!,rnlm review board 
will put the university at legal risk, 
according to station co-Manager 
Andrew Tess, who has consulted the 
Student Press Law Center. Ratcliff 
also ordered ' that all programs be 
scheduled a week in advlmce, a con-
dition that would destroy the spirit 
of SRTV; according to station co-
Mamger ' liffany Rapp. 

"The possibility to rUIl programs 
live and at any timc is part of dlC 
stati n's excitement," she ~aid after 
the council shut down the 'itation. 
"That's the way wc've always done 
it, and thats the way it should he." 

Ilowevcr, that practice was 
exacdy what led [0 the cUlll1cil 's 
concerns with the st:ltion, Ratcliff 

~aid. Councilmcmhers approved 
twO mcasure~ rcguding SRTV over 
the last few months: One banned 
York from SR'I premise, while 
anodlcr prohibited the broadcast of 
"graphiC:J1 depictions of sexual activ-
ity involving nudity." 

" If srudcnts are trdining for the 
real world, th ey have to see that even 
in commercial television, you need 
to have scheduled progralluning," 
Ratcliff aid. " I don't think that it's 
an effective control Ito give] a how's 
producer permission to enter the 
station, unbeknown to anyone, and 
put on a show at any time." 

Ratcliff's demand for a review 
board wa borne of research of other 
campus' media charters, which he 
found to be much more stri ngent 
than at SRT\T. UCLA has a com-
munications board that provides 
oversight, including "regular review 
of its publications and broadcasts," 
providing "whatever disciplinary 
action it deems appropriate" for sru -
dent-run media. 

The outline of standards is not 
a disciplinary action, but a guide 
for the council to lISe to bring hack

the sta tion as q uickly a~ possi ble, 
>1ccording to Ra tclifT. '1l1e sooner 
the council GlIl rewrite th\! SRI\' 
charter to producc more account-
ability and order, the sooner the 
signal fecli will be tumed on. 

Odler actions by the council "till 
concern Ratcliff, however. Sweetcn's 
certification of a special election, 
which could overturn both of the 
recent SRTV regulations, contains a 
loophole Ulat is " uJ1tcnaiJlc," Ratcliff 
said. Under th e A.S. constitution, 
if the cow1cil 's decisions are over-
turned by student vote, cowlcil -

n~embers cannot revisit the a ffcctct! 
legisla tion for a year. 

"L1St spring, the council a ked 
York not to air that kind of pro-
gramming again, " Ratcliff said. 
"Thi year tlley tabled the nudity 
ban. Then he did it again . Then 
they passed the ban. Then he did it 
again, and aU<1cked a senator with 
his show. The notion that a pro-
hibition of Yorks broadcasts could 
not be touchcd for a year is not 
responsible. " 

In the end, the university still has 
ultimate say over the matrer, because 
ir owns the cables uscd 10 transmir 
the station's signal, Ratcliff sa id . But 
"the administrdtion" wants to leave 
the choice up to srudcnrs.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 

MONDrY, NOVEMBER 21, 2005 
, 

W hen out danc-ing in Pacific Beach with gi rl fri ends, Chi lea n stu-
dent Maria Jose Viollier had no 
qualms about brushing off the men 
who pressed up behind her, trying 
to engage her in an American-style 
grind , In Chile, dancing is rhyth -
mic and ccrtainly exy - but ir 
occurs with spa ce between a cou-
ple's bodies. D ance th at resembles 
foreplay made Viollier uncomfort-
ablc. 

Dilemmas arising from cultural 
differences are an inevitable part 
of the study-abroad experi ence -
especially if you're a woman living 
in UCSD's International H ouse. 
Unfortunately, women studying 
abroad face an extra set of wor-
ries about s ta ru~ and safety, lead-
ing many study-abroad p~ograms 
to provide additional training for 
female students about prevailing 
American attitudes toward women , 
as well as acceptable behavi o r in 
the States, 

In International Il ouse, the 
union of multiple culrure force~ 
women from around the globe to 
cope with differences rel~ting to 
everything from greetings to sex, 

I-House, a three- building 
co-cd dorm complex in E leanor 
Roosevelt College, was founded 
in 19 8 with the goa l o f bringing 
together international scholars and 
resident Tritons, Each aparonent 
is half American and half inter-
national. Residents participate in 
activities such as Global Gourmet 
o r the International Affairs Croup 
to promote cu ltural exchange and 
understanding, 

in I-House, American dorm life 
is the dominant cu lture - g iv-
ing international students a truly 
American college experience 
- but it is infused with customs 
from around the globe. You might 
see a group of ·tudents sitting on 
Internaliona l Walk with a late-
n ight cup of tea, whi le others spark 
a midnight run to In-N-Out.

countries living in an insular com-
.munity, even everyday interaction 
can be bewildering. 

For many international stu-
dents, the adjustments begin with 
the introduction. 

When meeting someone in 
Chile, Viollier, a student from 
Pontificia niversidad Catolica de 
Ch il e, said peopl e kiss once on the 
cheek and begin a conversation. 

he found the American tradition 
of shaki ng hands very cold. "At 
fi rst it seemed impolite," she sa id. 
"For m e, it 's ,0 much more kindl ), 
to kiss than to shake hands." 

Angelique Brouwer, a student 
from the University of Lciden in 
Holland , had the opposite reac-
tion to Am erican greetings, She 
found Americans enthu siastic and 
friendly, and was surprised that 
th ey continuall), ask, " li e)" how's 
it going?" or "\\' hat's up?" because 
the Du tch, according to Brouwer, 
would only he that warm with 
their close friends, She felt unsure 
about how to respond, Several 

time~, she said , she gave a genuine 
answer about her clay, th~n real-
ized that the person wa, already 
walking aw,ly. 

V\ 'o rking at a coffee cart un 
campus, Brouwe r quickl~ learned 
that these commen ts a re not fake, 
just customary. r t took some time 
to accli mate to suc h brief inter-
changes; at fi rst she felt like her 
panern of speech was toO slow, 
but now ' she's lea rn ed to speak 
quickl),. 

Once an I- Houser ha moved 
past the introductory stagc, .estdb-
lishing close friendships with 
either m ales or other females ma v 
require some compromise. Erika 
Oba, a J apanc e student from the 
U niversiry of Tsul,.'uba, explained 
that the way American students 
tease each other shocked her. To 
her, some of their jokes seemed 
overly frank and hurtful , and he 
had to struggle not to take th em 
seriously. 

Though she's used to, a less 

~ THE l'CSD GL'ARDIAl'\ 

direct style of communi cati on, 
Oba has learned to appreciate the 
curt sense of humor, making digs 
of her own, Her friends recipro-
cate by toning down their com-
ments , 

W[ can accept some of it but not 
too much ," Oba said, And, about 
the times when she does join in, 
she said , " I find it fun beca use they 
accept that too. 0 1'm just enjoy-
in g it." 

I-House ha broadened Oba and 
Viollier's experiences with men. 
Viollier did no t have many male 
friends at home because she went 
to a girls' secondary seho?1 and he r 
univers ity cou rse in teaching are 
mainly for women. Si nce separate 
girls' and boys' schoo ls ar-e COIll -
mon in Chile, this is tnle for many, 
but not a ll , Chilean women. 

ba's university, by contrast, is 
in a scientific, contemporary city, 
wh ere male and female tudents are 
integrated, and even live together, 
H owever, Japanese women would 

never hug thei r ma le friends, nor 
would they dress with an exposed 
chest o r should ers. 

Erin Gonzales, an American 1-
Houser who studied in Bo rd eaux, 
France, last yea r, reca ll ed cop-
ing with different cultural no rms 
about dress wliile she was abroad. 

Feeling comfortable required 

r h a 
Gonzales 
understand the 
French concep-
tion of appropri- · 
arcness - which 
i, so nuanced that 
it someti mes appears 
inconsistent.

"One minute in a sun dress and 

already you feel like a prostitu te . 
It's strange because women call be 
half-naked on a beach and never 
get a second glance," 

From the J apa nese or Chilean 
perspective, Americans have liberal 
male- female relations . The Dutch,

microcosm of diverse cultures 

rOlllinued from page 9 
In fact, sexual life at co ll ege in 

all three countries seems not to 
differ much from thar at CSD. 
Both Bro uwer and Oha indi-
ca ted tha t man)' types of rcla -
cionships arc acceptable in thcir 
home countries, as they are here. 
Though taboos about discussing 
sex are stronger in Japan, prac-
t ices are about the same, at least 
at Oha 's univers ity. 

For Vio lli cr, the eOlllpari -

enend their lead to 32-19 with less 
than three minutes remaining. The 
Mustdngs took a 36-26 lead into the 
half, but the Tritons returned in the 
second half determined to win. 

With S<Ul Luis Obispo holding 
a 51 -38 advantage at the 12 minute, 
10 second mark, freshman gulIrd 
Shane Poppen converted a three-
point play and scored seven of the 
Triton~' next 10 points, igniting a 
19-6 run that left UCSD and Sm 
Luis Obispo tied at 57 wid! juSt over 
five minutes to play. Andrew Hatch 
brought UCSD back to within three 
points with 16 seconds remaining, 
but the M ustlngs made three free 
throws to secure the win. 

Free throws proved an important 
key for the Mustangs' win. 'v\'hile

The day before, the T riton blew 
out No. 19 Redlands 9-3 with 
Hopkins scorin g one- third of the 
Tritons' goals and senior Chris 
Eichholz contributing two of his 
own . The victOry gave UCSD its 
1Ii~hest number of wins in schoo l 
history, the old record coming Jrejll the Tritons' 1993 team , 
which went 23-9. 

Hopkins was named V,rWPA 
.t>,hiyer of the Year while Finegold 
and Borso were named to the A11-
WWPA First Team . Eich hol z and 
.senior Colin McElroy received 
hODorable mentions. 

Mustangs attempted 39 free throws, 
nearly three times as lIlany as the 
Tritons. The Mustilngs were able to 
convert nearly 70 percent of their 
attempts, with senior center G.Jbe 
Stephenson breaking a 42-year-old 
team record with 16 successful free 
throws, part of his game-high 22 
points. 

UCSD was led by one of the 
team's nine newcomers, freshman 
forward Darryl Lawlor. Lawlor had 
14 points on 5-of-6 sh ooting from 
tile field, while sophomore Clint 
Allard scored I I points. 

The Mustangs dominated on the 
boards, out-rebounding thc Tritons 
39-21. UCSD allowed San Luis 
Obispo too many second chances, 
allowi ng the Mu tangs to notch 17 
offem.ive rebOlllld . UCSD did, how-
ever, have fOllr takeaways and only 
nine lurnovers, whilt: the Mu~tdllgs 
had one steal and 10 turnovers.
