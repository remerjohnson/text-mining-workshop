A.S. Debate. 
Student Health Fee 
SAN DIEGO - SDSU's 
Associated Students debated a 
proposed $10 student-health 
fee increase last Wednesday. 
The proposal would allow 
students to receive health care 
during the winter and summer 
sessions at no additional cost. 
A fiDal..decision will be made 
next Wednesday. Students 
expressed concern about the 
fee increase despite reassur-
ances by the Student Health 
Advisory Board. "I would like 
to be assured I am getting my 
$10 worth and it is not being 
used to cover a collective-
bargaining agreement," said 
A.S. Executive Vice President 
Mike Ashworth. 

Students Protest 
Chlapan Violence 
DAVIS - UCD students 
protested alleged human-rights 
abuses against natives in 
Chiapas, Mexico, at a rally last 
Thursday. Several students 
dressed in black with red 
bandannas and carried flags 
displaying "EZLN" to show 
support for the rebelling 
Zapatistas. According to UCD 
Professor of Native-American 
studies Ines Hernandez-Avila, 
the Mexican government has 
resumed its bombing of 
Chiapas following a period of 
peaceful discussions. 
The Zapatistan Army of 
National Liberation began its 
uprising over a year ago. 
Several speakers at the rally 
criticized the media for 
inaccurately portraying the 
problems of the region. 
Others added that Americans 
have contributed to the 
situation by supporting the 
Mexican government.

Dean of Social 
Sciences to 
Take Position 
At Princeton 

NEWS ANALYSIS 

ACADEMIA: Rothschild will 
head the Woodrow Wilson 
School of International Affairs 

California 
once offered 
affordable 
education 
for all; now 
that promise 
is in doubt 

By 

The widely acclaimed Master Plan for Higher Education, which codified California's promise to provide every qualified citizen 
with a Iow<OSt, high~lity four-year education, has 
been rattled by California's worst economic 
downturn since the Great Depression. Starved by five 
years of sharply reduced budgets, California's systems 
of higher education - University of California, 
California State University and the California 
Community CoUeges - have ushed in an era of 
unprecedented fee hikes and downsizing. 

By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

Michael Rothschild, dean of the Division of 
Social Sciences at UCSD, has been named to 
head the prestigious Woodrow Wilson School 
of Public and International Affairs at Princeton 
University. 

Rothschild, who has led the 12 departments 
of the social sciences division since 1985, will 
begin his new post as dean at the public policy 
institution on July 1 of this year. 

Woodrow Wilson's Acting Dean James 
Trussell, who worked with Rothschild when he 
was an economics professor at Princeton from 
1972-76, said, "I think it's a wonderful appoint-
ment for Princeton. [Rothschild] is a first class 
academic and scholar, and an able and effective 
administrator. " 

"The Woodrow Wilson School is clearly one 
of the very best public policy schools in the 
nation," Rothschild said. 

DOUG ALEXANDER, 
Senior Staff Writer 

While the state's public universities have weath-
ered hard times before, a growing number of analysts 
say that there is no expectation that state funding will 
be restored. With the state's discretionary budget 
tightening and a "tidal wave" of studentspoised to fill its 

universities by the next decade, critics say that the 
state's 35-year commitment to affordable higher 
education is become a relic of the past 

He added, however, that he will be sad to 
leave UCSD, where he has facilitated the cre-
ation of the Departments of Cognitive Science 
and Ethnic Studies in his division.

Rothschild said he has been able to improve 
the quantity and quality of the social sciences 
faculty during his tenure. "I am very excited by 
how many first-class social scientists and de-
partments there are in the social sciences," he 
said. 

Rothschild stressed that a dean must be able 
to listen to and work with the.faculty.ln creating 
the Departments of Ethnic Studies and Cogni-
tive Science, Rothschild said, "In each case 
there was a group of faculty members with a 
plan and a vision, and I helped them." 

"He's an excellent dean because he helps the 
departments become what they want to be -
what kind of people to hire and what programs 
- he's supportive in all aspects," said Depart-
ment of Political Science Chairman Gary 
Jacobson, who has worked with Rothschild 
since the dean assumed his post

Credit for Nine Biology Lab Classes to Be Increased in Spring 
UNITS: Upper-division 
labs with large work 
loads will gain credit 
By Ben EICIn 
Senior Staff Writer 

Nine upper-division biology lab 
classes have been slated for a two-
unit course credit increase due to a 
recent agreement reached between 
the Committee on Education Policy 
(CEP) and the UCSD Department 
of Biology. 

An extensive survey of lab classes 
conducted by the CEP revealed dis-

crepancies between the work-load 
shouldered by students and the num-
ber of units awarded. 

Academic Senate bylaws state 
that students will receive one unit of 
credit for every three hours of work 
per week. According to A.S. Com-
missioner of Academ ic Affairs 
David Valentine, students often 
commit between 18 to 20 hours per 
week to labs which allot only four 
units. 

"[The time commitment] goes 
again t academic bylaws," said Val-
entine. "These reform have been a 
long time coming." 

The Department of Biology and 
CEP sought to equate credit allot-
ment with the time commitment in-
volved in each different kind of lab. 
Courses scheduled for the unit in-
crease include BlBC 103, BlCD 123 
and 131,BIEB 121,165,167and 179, 
and BIPN 105 and 145. 

"There are two distinctly differ-
ent kinds of labs in the biology de-
partment and this recognizes the 
difference between them," aid CEP 
Chair Alden Mo hammer. 

Academic Senate Manager 
Bonnie Horstmann hope that the 
unit increase will prevent cour e 

material from being excluded, due 
to the accommodation of Senate 
bylaws. 

"Students thought it would be 
doing them a disservice by cutting 
out some of the material, because 
they are getting good preparation 
for graduate school," said 
Horstmann. 

As the student representative to 
CEP, Valentine uggested the lab-
unit reform la t pring. After com-
paring departmental evaluation of 
courses to course and profe or 
evaluation (CAPE), he saw large

The budget crisis was also a big 
challenge for Rothschild, who 
helped the social sciences division 
become the largest at UCSD in terms 
of the number of faculty. He said 
that a drop in funding has led to less 
support for faculty services, and 
larger class size.

the social sciences as lab experience 
is to the physical sciences or per-
forming is to the arts. "However, I 
think more students can go through 
social science without ever having 
the experience of small classes than 
it used to be - and that's wrong." 

Rothschild said that he plans to 
look intoexpandingmid-careeredu-
cation at Woodrow Wilson School, 
which also offers undergraduate and 
graduate degrees. 

He added that he would like to 
target professionals working in " less 
traditional" public service groups, 
such as Amnesty International, 
Oxfam and grass-roots organiza-
tions. 

"Public service is becoming a bit 
more anarchic, a bit less govern-
mental," he said. "Worrying how to 
prepare people for this change and 
how to provide continuing educa-
tion for people working is such non-
traditional areas seems like a chal-
lenge." 

Along with his administrative 
position, Rothschild is also a distin-
guished economic theorist who has 
worked on a broad range of sub-
jects, including decision-making 
under uncertainty, investment and 
jury-decision processes. 

CREDIT: Other 
majors may not 
increase lab credit 
Continued from pace 1 
differences in the amount of 
coursework being reported. Often, 
Valentine claims, departments 
would not report any outside prepa-
ration time in order to meet the Aca-
demic Senate bylaws. 

Valentine issued a proposal 
which would force lab credits to 
mirror their actual work-load. 

"I think the students work very 
hard and they spend enormous 
amounts of time on their labs, prob-
ably more than six units worth," said 
Biology Professor William Harris. 

"Upper-division labs are a lot 
more detailed so I think we deserve 
more credit," said junior Sandeep 

"He had one of the first break-
throughs in the effects ofuncertain-
'ties," said Department of Econom-
ics Chairman Vincent Crawford. 
" He is one of the world 's leading 
scholars in the analysis of uncer-
tainties ... having to do with the 
concept of risk and risk aversion." 

Rothschild's most recent schol-
arship has focused on the econom-
ics of higher education, an institu-
tion which, he says, defies the usual 
laws of economics. "To an econo-
mist it 's a very strange business 
because Ihe universities sell educa-
tion, but they don 't sell it to the 
highest bidder," he said. 

A 1963 graduate of Oregon's 
Reed College, Rothschild earned his 
M.A. in international relations from 
Yale University in 1965 and his 
Ph.D. i.n economics from Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology in 
1969. He has since served as a pro-
fessor at Harvard, Princelon and 
University of Wisconsin at Madi-
son before joining the faculty of 
economics at UCSD in 1983. 

Rothschild is a fellow of the 
American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences and the Econometric Soci-
ety and has held a Guggenheim Fel-
lowship and various research grants 
from the National Science Founda-
tion. 

Reen, a bio-chemistry major. "If 
you take the amount of time spent in 
class, it is twice as much as any 
normal class." 

CEP's findings also revealed unit 
discrepancies within the Department 
of Chemistry and the Division of 
Engineering. 

According to Valentine, depart-
ments with unit-heavy majors, such 
as engineering, are less likely to 
rethink their lab credits, due to the 
large number of total units already 
required to graduate. Increasing 
credits for labs, he said, would only 
push that requirement upward. 

Horstmann does not foresee this 
occurring with the biology depart-
ment. "Biology is not a heavy-unit 
major," said Horstmann. "CEP was 
concerned that this would reduce by 
one the number of courses a student 
would take."

Breaking Up Is Hard to Do 
In the Republican Party 

Despite the onslaught of Republican victories last November, the 
Republican Party itself is showing signs of stress. The chasm in the 
Republican mountain is widening over the age-old issue of abortion, 
sparked by President Clinton 's nomination of Dr. Henry Fo.ster for 
Surgeon General. The Republicans are concerned that Foster, an 
obstetrician, had performed several abortions. 

Though moderate pro-choice Republicans in Washington and 
Christian Right groups have bitterly debated Ihis issue for years, the 
threat of party division has only recent.ly surfaced. 

"Pro-life and pro-family voters, a third of the electorate, will not 
support a party that retreats from its noble and historic defense of 
traditional values and which has a national ticket or a platform that 
does not share Ronald Reagan 's belief in the sanctity of innocent 
human life," said Christian Coalition Executive Director Ralph Reed 
on Feb. 10. In addition, Reed said that some moderate Republicans 
have "a major 'A-word' problem." 

Reed warned that religious conservatives would not support 
presidential candidates who are in favor of abortion - even under 
limited circumstances. Those who run under the Republican ticket in 
1996, Reed said, will have to either run pro-life or not run at all. Or they 
can run under a different party - perhaps Libertarian or Independent. 
This possibility is the greatest hope - not for the Republican Party, but 
for U.S. citizens, the majority of whom are pro-choice. 

According to a New York Times and CBS News poll last summer, 40 
percent of adults questioned agreed with the statement" Abortion should 
be generally available to those who want it," and 37 percent agreed with 
"Abortion should be available but under stricter limits than it is now." 
Only 21 percent agreed with "Abortion should not be permitted." 
Among Republicans, the numbers were slightly lower for general 
availability, 3~ percent. The number of Republicans who agreed that 
abortion should be available with restriction, however, was the same: 37 
percent. Twenty-eight percent said it should not be permitted. 

Religious pro-lifers are clearly not in the majority, and leaders 
such as Reed have no place in trying to persuade a major political 
force to either go his way or no way. If the Republican Party does 
split up, then good riddance. Those who still side with the Christian 
Right will remain in the minority, and perhaps the rest of the country 
will finally have candidates they can vote for, rather than agaillSt. 

Senator's Flaky Comment 
Is Ignorant of State's Past 

In a statement reminiscent of the McCarthy era, Senator Bill 
Leonard protested the appointment of Angela Davis to a UC Santa 
Cruz Presidential Chair, on Feb. 10. Davis was awarded the post 
because of her ideas to expand the campus' feminist and ethnic 
studies programs. Leonard said the appointment " .. . reminds Ameri-
cans of California's flaky past at a time when we ' re trying to build 
up our reputation .... The entire integrity of the system is on the line 
when it appoints someone with Ms. Davis ' reputation for racism, 
violence and communism." 

Does this hyperbolic statement remind anyone of a certain senator 
from Wisconsin? And who exactly does Leonard believe perpetuated 
the "flaky" image? Political activists interested in the civil-rights 
movement or would-be senators who pay $30 million out of their own 
pockets for their campaigns to buy their way into office? 

Leonard needs to take a closer look at why California is per-
ceived as flaky ; maybe then he will realize that Davis is exactly the 
kind of image which California needs. 

California's bimbo image stems from the fact that many see it as 
the bastion of superficiality - a state based on money and all that it 
can buy. In the 1980s, it was a common joke, but also a fact , that if 
California had been an independent nation, it would have been the 
seventh ri&est country in the world. Our state boasts consumer 
monstrosities such as Disneyland, Universal Studios and a rock star 
with an amusement park and a llama farm in his backyard. Leonard 
is worried about a political activist with a Ph.D. making the state 
look flaky? 

Davis, a UCSD graduate, was a prominent political activist in the 
late 196Os. Shc is an outspoken feminist, lecturer and author of five 
books. Leonard has chosen to emphasize that Davis was charged as a 
conspirator in a kidnapping and murder case; Leonard should be 
reminded that Davis was acquitted of this charge. 

Davis' appointment is a crucial step toward improving 
California's image in an era in which a conservative right-wing 
coalition threatens to dominate politics. Leonard feels frightened that 
the university has remained progressive and not adopted the 
conservatism which has recently overtaken ihe government. How-
ever, if statements like this continue to be issued from the right-wing 
camp, "McCarlhyi m," not "flaky ," will be the new word of choice.

GETTING CAUGHT IN THE 
CENSORSHIP 'NET' 

COMMENTARY: Institutions which provide access to the Internet, 
such as universities, have no right to dictate morality to netrunners 
By Alnlt Asaravala 
Staff Writer 

Begun during the 1960s by the Defense Depart-
ment, the Internet provided a method for researchers 
to send mass information through ordinary telephone 
lines. During the 1980s, the Internet evolved to its 
present state as a commonality. Over 30 million 
people use it on a daily basis world-wide. But de-
spite its power and benefits, the Net is not praised by 
everyone. 

Most businesses, universities and institutes give 
full Internet access to their members. 
And commercial providers, such as 
America Online and Compuserve, 
provide access to anyone with a com-
puter and a modem. This wipe-spread 
availability, combined with users' 
anonymity, has sparked a wide band 
of underground and unorthodox ac-
tivity. 

Last November, Carnegie Mellon University 
(CMU) decided to eliminate sexually explicit news 
groups from its Internet access. The university claims 
legal reasons for its decision, yet there are no legal 
binds in providing such material via the Internet. Since 
CMU is only acting as a distributor of information, 
and not a creator of obscenity, the legal argument 
quickly crashes. Ironically, CMU developed many 
Internet utilities such as the Lycos Search, which finds 
certain keywords anywhere on the Net. 

Paul Heckbert, Assistant Professor of Computer 
Science at CMU, replied to the new 
policy by posting an E-mail message 
in a public news group stating, "In the 
grand scheme of things, these news 
groups do not constitute a significant 
threat to the morals of the students or 
anyone else at CMU. On the contrary, 
the ban sets an example by limiting free 
speech, thereby promoting a question-
able morality of its own." Political correctness no longer 

holds any meaning when one reads or 
leaves messages on public news 
groups, such as alt. sex, which is the 
second most popular forum (behind 
news.announce.newusers), claiming 
350,000 readers world-wide. And oth-
erwise-taboo topics perpetuate discus-
sions, in real-time, on Internet Relay 
Chat (IRC) channels such as 
#truthdare and #Crossdress. A Decem-
ber 1994 Rolling Stone article calls the 
Internet " ... a lawless boomtown 
where ... [a person] could mouth offin 
any way he wanted without fear of 
repercussion. " 

Well-meaning individuals and pub-
lic interest groups continually chal-
lenge this lack of regulation and com-

When It comes 
to computing, 
some 
universities 
blatantly 
disregard the 
basic 
principles of 
the First 
Amendment. 

Most people using the Net have 
already established their own set of 
beliefs and morals. To say that an 
IRC conversation or a news-group 
article is going to change an 
individual's values is to underesti-
mate his maturity. 

In 1992, anti-Semitic material 
available at UC Berkeley via the 
Internet was challenged by a student 
claiming the material was offensive 
and misleading. In this case, not only 
the university, but the Anti-Defamation 
League ofB'nai B'rith said censorship 
would be inappropriate and unneces-
sary. 

Not all challenges to free speech 

plete freedom of speech. While commercial providers 
have always limited what clients can and cannot ac-
cess, controversy remains over whether public provid-
ers, such as universities, should censor potentially of-
fensive materials. 

Iowa State University (ISU), citing obscenety laws, 
restricted access to most on-line discussions of sex in 
1992, although ' the law explicitly exempts universi-
ties. ISU later removed discussion of drugs and drug 
policy from the ban. . 

on the Net end up like the Berkeley 
case. In fact, some policies have been established 
under a non-sequitur blackout. Boston University for-
bids any computer user from "making accessible of-
fensive [or] annoying ... material." However, anyone 
with a grudge can easily manipulate this rule to his 
advantage.

tantly disregard the basic principles of the First Amend-

PIAN: Ambitious 
manifesto in place 
for 35 years 
ContInued from pale 1 
California Dr.ams 

Drafted in the late 1950s in re-
sponse to a projected boom of col-
lege-age students, the 1960 Master 
Plan for Higher Education was a 
sweeping manifesto of the state 's 
commitment to post-secondary edu-
cation, which served as the founda-
tion of California 's public universi -
ties for over 30 years. In conjunc-
tion with an ambitious expansion 
effort, the plan organized the state 
colleges under a hierarchical, 
tripartide system: the University of 
California, a world-renowned re-

transfer." The promise of higher 
education was an important factor 
in shaping the dreams of the Golden 
State. 

Allhough the Master Plan has 
not been immune to criticism or 
debate, its most celebrated idea -
accessibility to public higher edu-
cation - fared well during its first 
three decades and was remarkably 
free from political challenge. 
Shaky Ground 

In 1990, California was rocked 
by its worst economic downturn 
since the Great Depression. Aggra-
vated by federal defense cuts, which 
battered the state 's once-booming 
aerospace industry, the five-year 
crisis took its toll on California's 
public universitics: State funding of 
the U ni versity of California decl ined 

search and gradu-
ate studies institu-
tion; California 
State University 
(CSU), a well-re-
spected education 
center; and Cali-
fornia Community 
College (CCC), an 
occupational train-
ing ground and 
transfer point to 
four-yearcolleges.

13.7 percent between

Since its inception, the Master Plan 
has been widely credited as a model 
for public higher education both na-
tionally and abroad. 

In 1989, a French research team 
from theDrganizationfor Economic 
Cooperation and Development 
(DECD) wrote that the Master Plan 
uis the most advanced effort through 
state action to organize mass higher 
education ... while maintainil'!g a 
quality of research and education .. . 
unsurpassed anywhere among 
DECD countries and probably in 
the world .... " 

According to Professor Sheldon 
Rothblatt, director of UC Berkeley 's 
Center for Studies in Higher Educa-
tion Director, California's systems 
of post-secondary education have 
played a crucial role in the state's 
economic growth. uln 1910, a fa-
mous educator ... pointed out how 
intimately connected the state is to 
the university, that the fortunes of 
one rise with the fortunes of the 
other. I think that's very perceptive 
and very accurate," he said. Sheldon 
added that California's public uni-
versities have given residents great 
opportunity. "If they didn't get into 
Berkeley orSan Francisco state, they 
would go to community college and 

tor of the California 
Department ofFill"ance H.D. Palmer. 
He added that the state was unable 
to provide the level of fundi ng to 
higher education that "we would 
have all liked to have done." 

Grappling with huge fiscal short-
falls, California's public universi-
ties have enacted a number of aus-
terity measures to keep themselves 
afloat. At the University of Calif or-
nia, the Board of Regents' primary 
strategy has been to increase stu-
dent fees . From 1990-1994, under-
graduate fees skyrocketed 125 per-
cent, over 90 percent in real dollars. 
Fees have also jumped at CSU and 
the cces, 18.5 percent and 290 
percent respectively, but their cover 
charges have not been as damning 
as those at the Uc. Currently, UC 
fees stand at $3,799 per year, while 
CSU fees are at $1,584. A year of 
community college is $390. 

"To some unknown degree, these 
sharply higher fees - without off-
setting increases in need-based fi-
nancial aid - contributed to the 
drop in enrollments [at UC and 
CSU] .... ," Harvard Professor David 
Breneman stated in his controver-
sial California Higher Education 
Policy Center report, "A State of

At the UC Board of 
Regents meeting last 
Thursday at UCSD, LI. 
Gov. Gray Davis echoed 
Breneman 's statement, 
saying, "We can't blind 
ourselves to how much 
we've asked of students 
coming to this university 
[the UC). There's no doubt 
that we're pricing kids out 
of school." 

Below are the differences in the 
distribution of California's General 
Fund for 1995 and 2002 (projected). 

Co-author Roger Benjam in 
wrote, "I think we are seeing a ca-
lamity unfold in the case of higher 
education, California's system was 
a model for the nation .... But fund-
ing for higher education has been 
shrinking for almost a decade and 
the squeeze is going to get much 
worse." 

While UC enrollment 
has remained relatively 
stable, declining only by

91 to 1993-94, CSU has 
witnessed a decline of 
nearly tOpercent-34,319

SeniorConsultant Andy Shaw, how-
ever, said that all aspects of the 
budget compete for funding each. 
Assistant Director of California 
Department of Finance H.D. Palmer 
agreed, saying, "You can take any 
two segments of the budgel and try 
to pit them against one against the 
other, and it really does not make a 
whole lot of sense." mission have jumped over $50 mil-

lion and campus-based financial 
assistance, especially at the UC, has 
increased significantly as well. Crit-
ics such as Breneman, however, say 

. these increases have not kept pace 
with rising fees and tuition. Accord-
ing to a CHEPC report drafted by 
the Washington-based College 
Board, aggregate financial aid grew 
by only 60 percent in constant dol-
lars from 1990-91 to 1993-94, while 
fees have been much sharper. 

The CHEPC aid report also 
found that loans are the fastest grow-

. ing form of aid. Assistant Director 
of the CHEPCJoni Finney said this 
trend is alarming and will ultimately 
hurt the state. "When graduates get 
entry-level jobs they have less dis-
posable income ... they have to put 
off buying a car or a house, which 
has a ripple effect on the economy, " 
she said. Finney added that large 
debts also provide an incentive for 
graduates to pursue high-paying 
jobs that may not reflect their tal-
ents and interests, wh ich she said 
could adversely affect the laborsup-
ply for occupations such as K-12 
teaching. 

Declines in state funding of the 
public universities have also raised 
concerns about the quality of higher 
education. The University of Cali-
fornia,inmanywaysthecrownjewel 
of the state, has cut back funding of 
departments, frozen salaries and in-
troduced an aggressive early retire-
ment program, VERIP. In the last 
several years, nearly 2,000 full-time 
UC professors have taken the uni-
versity up on its offer. In addition, 
faculty salaries have fallen an esti-
mated 10.5 percent below the .na-
tional average, according a recent 
report by the California Post-Sec-
ondary Education Commission 
(CPEe). Outgoing UC President 
Jack Peltason, however, has prom-
ised faculty salary increases next 
academic year. 

Critics admil thaI UC and CSU 
administrators have had a eniviable 
job trying to maintain quality and 
access in the last five years, but 
many have taken them to task for 
implementing "stop-gag" policies 
to what they see as long-term prob-
lems. While California may be pull-
ing out of its economic slump, ac-
cording to Finney, "There 's no ex-
pectation of money returning to 
higher education." A growing num-
ber of critics and analysts warn that 
a budget crisis of unprecedented 
cope looms on Ihe horizon.

Given the budget crisis of the 
last five years and the long-term 
problems ahead, Breneman said the 
state and the universities must begin 
discussing the future of higher edu-
cation in California. "The commit-
ment [of the Master Plan] seems to 
be in peril, and what troubled me ... 
was it [the Master Plan] was sort of 
being let go without any conversa-
tion," Breneman said. 

Gomez agreed, but said he thinks 
the projected long-term crisis in 
higher education is largely a matter 
of priorities. "Americans have given 
in the past, a plan for some sort of 
achievement, some sort of goal, 
some sort of prize, some sort of 
pride in education. We see in the last 
few years a change in that. Educa-
tion is no longer seen as a goal," 
Gomez said. 

However, Palmer said Gov.

forcing the "threestrikes" crime law, 
which voters overwhelmingly ap-
proved last November. 

According to UCSA Executive 
Director Glenn Magpantay, how-
ever, "The governor has not made 
education a priority. I think it is 
clear to say - and it is evident -
that the State Senate has identified 
higher education as apriority," re-

by 21 Democratic and two Indepen-
dent senators, that Sen. Pro Tempore 
Bill Lockyer sent to Wilson, calling 
the proposed fee hikes in his budget 
a tax on the middle class. 

Rothblatt said he thinks the public 
is still supportive of education, but is 
also "confused and anxious" over is-

sues such as crime and illegal immi-
gration. Califomia, he said, is "much 
less golden" than it was in 1960 and 
that there is no longer a strong con-
sensus on public education. 

As for long-term planning within 
the University of California , 
Rothblatt said, "We don't know 
where we are going at the moment, 
and probably as a historian, I might 
think that we will be overtaken by 
events; that is, rather than anticipate 
them, we will probably beoverswept

The Splendid 
Fisher? 

Everyone has days like this, 
right? Days when nothing 
makes sense. Days when you 
want to sit back with a bag of 
carrols, a Fruit Roll-Up and a 
beer - and simply think 
things through. 

Triton Women Ry to Fourth 
Well, I've had a lot like that 

lately. I've got some rage to 
release. I've got some crazy 
ideas, and I've got to get' em 
off my finely sculpted chest. 
There's just a lot of things that 
are bugging me, especially in 
the world of sports. 

Either that, or I'm still 
depressed over the not-so-
impres$ive reviews of David 
Hasselhoff's new album, 
"Boobwatch: Unplugged." 

Which reminds me, If I 
ever catch that bastard from 
the Times who wrote 
"[Hasselhoff] has as much 
talent as a trained monkey," 
I'll tear off his head and feed it 
to his neck. It just proves the 
fact that greatness breeds 
ignorance. 

In any case, everything 
started last weekend. I was 
sitting in a D.C. bar, tossing 
down tequila shots with ex-
Secretary of State James Baker 
- yeah, I talk to him once in a 
while - and he said some 
things that, well, really made 
me ponder. 

He turned and looked at me 
all blurry-eyed, and he said, 
«, Sports Rage,' I've been 
thinking what it must be like 
around the Ronald Goldman 
household at breakfast." 

"What do you mean?" I 
'asked. I was pleased that the 
subject of the evening might 
remotely pertain to sports. 
Usually, '01 Baker just 
complains about Reagan. 

"It must be awful," he said. 
"I mean, what happens when 
you innocently ask someone to 
' Pass the O.J. '? I can just 
imagine the cringing." 

Of course, I thought he was 
an insensitive slob, but I 
couldn 't ignore the wisdom 
behind his words. I mean, he 
made me wonder about the 
complexities which 've graced 
the headlines of the sports 
section in recent months. 

Like the baseball strike. 
When you look at it from the 
big picture, both sides are 
running themselves into the 
ground. And you know, I have 
only one thing to say to those 
idiotic, jobless, striking 
hardballers: I hope you know 
how to operate a staple gun. 

ONE UP: UCSD's 
women capture fourth, 
but the men struggled. 
By Dan Krett 
Sports Editor 

All season long, the UCSD 
men's swimming team has struggled 
to put it together, while the women's 

team has domi-
nated. 

Las 
weekend 's Pacific 
Coast Swim Con-
ference Champi-

... I!"!II!I"I onships (PCSCC) 
were a synopsis of 
the Tritons ' entire 
season as the 
women swam sol-
idly while the 

men struggled to make their mark. 
The PCSCCs offered the teams 

an opportunity to compete against 
some Division I and II opponents 
in addition affording a late chance 
to qualify for NCAAs which began 
on March 9 for the women and 
March 16 for the men. 

The women's team grabbed 
fourth in the conference behind the 
strength of their top swimmers who 
were not shaven for the meet. 

"The girls had a great meet," 
Head Coach Doug Boyd said. "That 
was the best conference meet the 
girls have had since I've been here." 

Kristin Kemmer took full advan-
tage of her final qualifying oppor-

tunity and stormed into the NCAA 
field in tbe 100- (I :01.04) and 200-
yard (2: 11.1) backstroke events. 

Renee Salgado also joined the 
NCAA party with a pair of terrific 
swims in the 500- (5 :12.7) and 
1 ,600-yard (17:53.5) freestyle races. 
A pair of Triton women managed 
to make the ' B'-cut for NCAAs. 
This means that their times will be 
thrown in with a group of the best 

not to qualify and the entrants will 
be determined next week. 

Melissa Kealey made the' B' -cut 
in the 1 OO-yard breaststroke, storm-
ing to the finish in I :09.7. Shelley 
Tabke also managed to get her name 
entered into the pot for further con-
sideration by logging a fast swi m in 
the 200-yard breaststroke (2:30.5). 
Finally, Laurie Boyd maintained 
hopes of joining the NCAA field 

with a 1:57.4 time in the 2OO-yard 
freestyle. 

Among the leaders of the team 
who stood out were Shawna Cabal-
lero and Dustin Matthew. Caballero 
earned third-place honors in the 
loo-yard freestyle (53.4) missing 
her lifetime best by a mere tenth of 
a second. She also rose 10 the occa-

ditional drive is mean -
ingless? 

Think again. 
The UCSD golf 

team, competing last 
weekend in a dual 
match at the Los Verdes 
Golf Course in Palos 
Verdes, CA, slipped by 
the strong squad from 
Cal State-Dominguez 
Hills by - no, this is 
not a misprint - a mere 

points to beat Dominguez Hill 's 315 fi -
nal score. 

UCSD 's veteran stando ut , Arnie 
Campbell, was the only medalist of the 
tourney, shooting a solid day of golf and 
notching an exceptionally low 72 on the 
par 71 course. 

The Triton duffers ' number-two man 
was Brian Walter, a newcomer at the top 
of the scoring sheet, who shot a nine-over 
par, 80 overall. 

UCSD teammates Tom Brown and 
Jim O'Grady exactly equaled each other 's 
best efforts with a pair of to-over par 
81 's. 

See CRAZY, Page 15 Tom Brown shot II solId 81 In the Doml~uez match. 

When the final scores were tallied, the 
Tritons garnered a lower total of 314 

In the "best four out of six" scoring 
system used in collegiate golf, UCSD's 
Pete Roberts and Alex Behrend were ex-
cluded from the Triton overall tally. Their 
II-over par 83's were discounted toward 
the Tritons' 314 mark.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Cycling 

This weekend's cy-

• 

cling action took place at 
Cal Poly Pomona. On Sat-
urday afternoon, the 
UCSD cycling squad 

competed in a half-mile criterium, and 
on Sunday it was a hill-climb time trial 
up Mt. Baldy which challenged the Tri-
ton cyclists. 

Saturday afternoon's race was high-
lighted for UCSD by the effort of Dan 
Sawada in the men's 'C' division who 
captured first place by the slimmest of 
margins after winning a long, fast sprint. 
Adam Livingston held his own in the 
'A' division, grabbing third place. 

The women of the 'B' squad were 
dominant, sweeping the top three 
places, as Kate Elsley led the pack of 
UCSD sprinters. She was closely fo l-

headwinds. The men 's 'A' team perse-
vered, however, as Adam Livingston 
conquered the mountain to take the top 
spot in a time of .51:14. 

He was followed up the course by 
Erik Stauber in fourth (53:.51). Chad 
Roemer earned a second-place finish in 
the'S' division with a time of .55:04. 

"I like time trials," Roemer said. 
"There's no luck involved. Doing well 
is just a mailer of how much you can 
suffer." 

The women did not fare quite as well 
on the wind-whipped course. Francis 
(I: 10.11) and Elsley (1: 11.(0) grabbed 
the third and fourth positions, respec-
tively, for the ' A' team. Wood came 
through again for the ' B' team, snaring 
a fourth-place finish in a time of 1 :18.08.

They're not the Divi-

standouts of the same col-
lege, but their results are 
eerily similar. 

They're the women of the UCSD club 
soccer team (2-1), and they 're racking up 
wins faster than their forwards ean sprint 
down the field. 

The Tritons' opening contest of the sea-
son - which stretches well into May _ 
was a stunning victory in which UCSD 
crushed the San Marcos Strikers, 4-0. 

The Tritons scored all four goals in the 
first half, led by Karlyn Clifton's two 
scores. Jessica Parker and Ruby Lipsinthal 
also added points for the UCSD cause. 

In fact, the Tritons placed a few 
points behind the champion Uni-
versity of Oregon. UCSD finished 
third out of eight teams in overall 
points, and - with the smallest 
team present - demonstrated that 
it was a group worthy of respect 
and recognition. The Tritons made 
up for their lack of personnel with 
outstanding individual riding. 

New team member Katrina 
Thomas, riding at her home barn 
at Stanford, notched a second-
place finish in Open Fences and a 
fifth in Open Equestrian. Adrienne 
Laksfoes was also a star, winning 
Novice Fences and placing second

strongest teams in the league."

No Gold In This Rainbow 
o FOR 10: The Tritons were unable to pick up their first victory of the 
season in a weekend trip to Hawaii to match up with the Rainbows 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

The tJCSD men's ,,:olleyball 
team (0-10) took off to the Hawai-
ian Islands last week for a two-game 

showdown with 
the Hawaii Rain-
bows, looking to 
put a halt to their 
eight-game losing 
streak. 

Between the 
luaus and trips to 
Waikiki Beach, 
the Tritons actu-
ally found a lillie 
time for volley-

ball action, but they could not put it 
together in front of a gracious crowd 
of over 1,300 people. Hawaii took 
two straight from VCSD, running 
the team's futility streak to 10 
games. 

Hawaii (5-2, 5-1) utilized the 
large crowds to its advantage, as 
they controlled both matches from 
the start. The first match was com-
pletely dominated by the strong 
Rainbow team, 15-2, \5-2, 15-6, 
which outblocked the Tritons in the 

match, 13-1. The second match was 
a little better for UCSD, but the out-
come was not, as Hawaii won eas-
ily again, 15-7, 15-7, 15-6. 

The Tritons' leaders played 
tough in both games, but did not 
match up well against Hawaii's big-
ger front line, 
which outblocked 
UCSD, 26-5, over 
the two games. 

Despite the re-
sults, the Tritons' 
trip to Hawaii was 
definitely a posi-
tive experience. 
Playing in front of 
such a large crowd 
was a nice change 
for UCSD, who is 
used to playing in 
empty gyms. 

People in Ha-
waii , having no 
professional teams, 
support the univer-
sity and appreciate 
big-time sports ac-

waii were a class act, cheeri ng all 
good plays, regardless of which 
team was making the play. Though 
they did not come home with a win, 
the Hawaiian experience was noth-
ing short of inspiring for the Triton 
volley bailers.

Tourney Trashing CRAZY: Old Man and the Sea? 
DOMINAnON: UCSD crushes its foes at last 
weeke.nd's Cal Lutheran tournament; Ho and 
Brownstein win the doubles title outright 
By Hilary Somers 
Staff Writer 

You would have thought the Cal 
Lutheran men's tennis team had 
seen enough of UCSD after the te-

nacious Tri-
tons pounded 
them at the 
North Courts 
on Feb. 10. 

But the 
Kingsmen 
were gluttons 
for punish-
ment last 
weekend 
when UCSD 
made a trip up 
to Cal 

Lutheran's home courts. It was a 
tournament where the Tritons con-
tinued their trend of mopping up 
their opponents. 

The UCSD racketeers ' domi-
nance began as they ripped it up in 
doubles action. The duo of Robert 
Ho and Dan Brounstein won the 
whole tournament, beating several 
respectable teams, including Divi-
sion I UCSB and Westmont. 

They survived a scare in the fi -
nals, however, clinching the outright 
title in a brutal three-set match, 7-
6, 2-6, 7-6, against Westmont. 

UCSD's Frank Heeb teamed up 
with Mike Wilson to turn in a win-
ning deuce, topping UCSC and 
UCSB, before losing a hard-fought 
match to Westmont. Agrueling third 
set - and only a 7-5 margin - did 
the Triton pair in. 

The UCSD doubles combos of 
Emil' Mihet / Scott Webb and Ari 
Markin I Hassan Akmal, playing for 
the first time together, showed ex-
cellent chemistry as well. Both tan-
dems made it to the semifinals of 
the flight . 

"We had a great doubles week-

end," Triton Head Coach Brian 
Turner said. 

UCSD had nothing to be 
ashamed of with its singles ap-
pearances. Ho lit it up on the 
court in both doubles and 
singles. Upon losing his first-
round match in the main draw, 
Ho cleaned up in consolations. 

Ho's doubles partner, 
Brounstein crushed his opponent 
in the first round. He then came 
very close to winning a three-set 
match against Cal Lutheran 's 
number-one player - who went 
on to win the entire tourney. 

Wilson, suffering a pulled 
Achilles ' tendon , played 
throughout the pain, pulling out 
a first-round victory. He then fell 
to the second seed from UCSC 
in the second round, 6-4, 6-4. 

Emil Mihet, playing in the 5-
8 singles flight, drew some bad 
luck in the first round, getting 
stopped by the number-one seed. 
He made up for it in th~ conso-
lation draw, though, eventually 
winning it all. 

Akmal, a Triton freshman, 
left his mark by making it to the 
finals of the main draw of the 5-
8 singles flight. In the finals, he 
lost the first set, 6-1, and was 
down in the secor:'d, 5-2, when 
he started his comeback. It was 
a little too late, however, and he 
lost the set, 7-5. 

Overall, UCSD notched up a 
highly successful weekend, 
gaining some strong wins to 
help their West Region rankings. 
With an exhausting weekend of 
tennis behind them - matches 
going all day long from 7 a.m. 
to 8 p.m. - the Tritons will be 
gearing up this week for their big 
match against Emory at home on 
March 5. 

Contlnuec1 from pace 9 
But there's lots more craziness 

too . Like in the NBA. Is Tom 
Gugliotta the curse of death? Is that 
Kurt Rarnbis playing for the Lakers, 
or is it a taxidermist's nightmare? 

What about the NFL? O.K., 
granted, there are no games going on 
right now, but did anyone see Deion 
on "Saturday Night Live?" About the 
only more embarrassing thing he 
could have done was try to sing -
Whoops! He did. 

What takes the cake, however, is 
the recent announcement that Ted 
Williams - the splendid splinter -
is the only person ever to be nomi-
nated for two sports hall-of-fames. 

Th~e are, of course, the Major 
League Baseball Hall-of-Fame in 
Cooperstown and, well , the 
Fisherman's Hall-of-Pame - which 
is probably located in the galley of 
some fat guy 's yacht. 

I guess I have a problem with this 
because I really don 't think fishing 
is a sport. I mean, your opponent 
doesn't even know you ' re playing. 

But enough of all this craziness. 
Pass the carrots and beer, and hand 
me a Fruit Roll-Up, would you?

time of 24.65 

Matthew shone in the breast-
stroke events, narrowly missing life-
time bests in the 100- (1:08.3) and 
200-yard (2:26.9) races despite be-
ing unshaven. 

The men had far less to cheer 
about. Mike Jefferson made the 'A'-
cut in the 200-yard 1M with a time 
of 1 :56.6, and Kaley Parkinson man-
aged ' B'-cut performances in the 
100· (47.08) and 2OO-yard (1 :43.7) 
freestyles. 

" We just didn 't look rested," 
Boyd said. "We'll take a week to rest 
and try to qualify some more th is 
weekend at the UCSD Invitational."

Creator Sherwood Schwarz's mythic family encounters the '90s 
are than a longer version of the popu-
IarTY series, The Brady Bunch Movie 
shows America's favorite family try-
ing to cope with the ' 90s. In a 

recent phone interview, producer Sherwood 
Schwarz said that it was never his intent to merely 
recreate his original concept. Instead, he said he 
hoped to hold a mirror up toourculiureand show 
us how rar we have come since the '70s. 

Set in 1990s Los Angeles, the family appears 
unaffected by the unraveling of its secure subur-
ban life. In fact, they haven't even noticed, Like 
the TY series, each member of the family has a 
mall crisis to solve, Marcia (Christine Taylur) 

has accepted two datesforthe same school dance. 
Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox) is struggling because she 
is jealous of Marcia and is beginning to hear 
"good" and "evil" inner voices, Cindy (Olivia 
Hack) is plagued by her bad habil of being a 
tattletale. Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes) is 
intent upon becoming a rock musician. Peter 
(Paul Sutera) is going through puberty and Bobby 
(Jesse Lee), while enjoying the powerofbeingon 
the school patrol, is realizing that his friends now 
ostracize him. 

Thecenlral crisis oflhe film, however, centers 
on the Brady's home, that enchanted castle where 
the '90s world is held atbay. Due to some unpaid 

back taxes, the Bradys must pay $20,000 before 
the end of Ihe week or the house will be auctioned 
to the highest bidder. In this case, the highest 
bidder will be Mr. Dilmeyer (Michael McKean), 
the Brady's neighbor, who has convinced his 
neighbors to sell their homes to make room for a 
mini-mall. Only the Bradys, who are fundamen-
tally uninterested in money, have refused 
Ditmeyer's repeated offers to buy their home at a 
full price. Now, it looks as though Ditmeyer will 
get the house by paying the tax bill, and Ihe 
Bradys will be homeless. 

Of course, in the end, the Bradys manage to

Laurie Anderson 
Performance artist discusses 

potential of technology 
By Jeff Nle.el 
Hiatus Editor 

Since the early '80s, New York 
performance artist Laurie Anderson, 
known for electronically altering her 
voice, has created music and art which 
combines politics and multi-media 
technology. She has directed her own 
feature film (Home of the Brave), 
hosted PBS 's television program 
"AI ive from Off Center" and written 
the score for Spalding Gray 's film I 
Monster in a Box. 

Last year, Anderson released the 
album Bright Red and in March, she 
will release The Ugly One with the 
Jewels, a collection of 18 spoken-
word pieces recorded live at Sadler's 
Theatre in London in May of 1994. 
Last year, she also released Stories 
from the Nerve Bible, a ~k ci1roni-
cling her career. Anderson is cur-
rently on her first major tour in five 
years and will perform on Saturday 
and Sunday at the Spreckels Theatre. 
During a recent phone interview from 
a tour slop in Berkeley, Anderson, 
who is in the process of developing a 
CD ROM, spoke about her interest in 
multi-media technology. 
au. ... 1: Do you .v. feel like 
JOU .. InvoIYed In too many 
projects? 

Anderson: I did before I left on the 
tour. I thought I would lose my mind. 
I was trying to finish a CD ROM and 

rehearse forthe tour. I had to get outof 
the house. Actually touring itself is 
comparatively incredibly relaxing. 

Many rock acts .. ~ 
u .. of h~ech _e .... 
ment. Are you usInC technoJ. 
00 In • political wey? 

I didn 't realize, before this tour 
began, how political it actually is. I 
think politics have become incredibly 
personal in this country. Politics are 
now Bill and Hilary Clinton, Newt's 
book and OJ. Simpson. People gravi-
'tate toward these thi ngs because there 
are huge issues at stake. It's a fascinat-
ing moment we live in because all 
these personal issues are being played 
out in political arenas. Questions like, 
"Is there a perfect family?" It ' s quite 
amazing. 
w.... you're Oft _ ... you 
IUITOUnded by comput .... .., 

No, not so that you see them click-
ing away. I feel a little sheepish about 
these high-tech things. I sometimes 
feel like an electronic salesman sur-
rounded by all this equipment. It 's 
like, so what. I think you can do 
amazing work with a peocil. The tricki-
est thing is to make something where 
the visuals don't just repeat what 
you're hearing. That's a very tough 
thing to. do. Multi-media shows are 
everywhere. A car has its own multi-
media show, but I don't think it's that 
fascinating. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Laurie Anderson will perform at 8 p.m. this weekend at 
the Spreckel. Theatre. 

On I recent trip to the

this experience affected JOUr 
work? 

I didn 't think itwould at first. I got 
very severe altitude sickness. I came 
back, and I thought "Wow. What an 
adventure I had." I dida whole record 
[Bright Red] not realizing it was about 
my experience. I thought I knew what 
I waswritingabou~but I didn't. I had 
to takeathree-day trip down the moun-
tain ina body bag. I was so disoriented 
that I thought I was swimming in an 
ocean. The first half of the show is 
about disorientation. 
'Ibat IOUIIds scary. 

In the end, it wasn'l. If you are

I think the NEA should have at 
least 20 times what they have to 
work with right now. This argu-
ment is in a long loop. We have to 
ask"What is our government about. 
Is it Newt as dad and everybody has 
10 shut up? Do we think artists are 
worth anything, even as exports?" 
We are exporters, and we are some-
times becoming cultural ambassa-
dors. All the software is designed 
by us. We havetofigureout how 10 
make it accessible 10 everyone.

BUNCH: 'Things 
have changed' 
Continued from paee H1 
pay their taxes just as their home goes 
up for auction. Those of us who 
watched all those re-runs knew it 
would tum out this way. One differ-
ence, however, is that theworldofth~ 
Bradys now consists of gangs, drugs 
and carjackings. 

"Twenty five years ago, all these 
problems - teen pregnancies, drugs, 
gangs - weren 't even on the hori-
zon," Schwarz said. "Things have 
changed so much. Today, you can get 
shot just walking down the street." 

An early version of the screenplay 
was actually much darker than the 
final one. In an initial version, Mike 
Brady flips hamburgers while Alice 
has an affair with Sam and almost 
every other serviceman she knows. 
Marcia has a lesbian affair, and Peter 
is beaten, stripped and locked in a 
closet by punks at school. Screen-
writers Bonnie Turner and Terry 
Turner made changes in the script so 
it wasn't the equivalent of a "Saturday 
Night Live" sketch stretched to cover 
the span of a feature movie. Schwarz 
said he was ultimately happy with the 
final screenplay. 

Although the film is funny, it is 
flawed by technical problems such as 
poor editing and writing, perhaps a 
result of the script changes. Some 
scenes, as when Marcia is approached 
by a lesbianclassmate(Alanna Ubach) 
are too predictable. 

Like Forrest Gump, The Brady 
Bunch Movie is ultimately about the 
triumph of innocence over evil. As 
Schwarzsaid, "In the battle of the '70s 
versus the '90s, the Bradys win. They 
have to win."

Spoken Word Witchery 
Lydia Lunch and Exene Ceroenka attack conventions 

By CI .... Zimmerman 
Staff Writer 

Last Sunday, eager fans filled the 
Rita Dean Gallery downtown to hear 
"Spoken Word Witchery" performed 
by Lydia Lunch and Exene Cervenka, 
two rock musicians turned full-time 
writers. When Lunch and Cervenka 
took their places side by side in front 
of two black music stands and started 
speaking to the largely female audi-
ence, the ensuing performance lived 
up to the high expectations. 

During the '70s and '80s, Lunch 
was involved in the underground New 
York rock scene, working with bands 
like Teenage Jesus, the Jerks and 8 
Eyed Spy, and collaborating on 
projects with other experimental mu-
sicians such as Sonic Youth's Thurston 
Moore. Exene Cervenka is the former 
singer and lyricist for the influential 
Los Angeles punk band X. With the 
publication of their book of poetry 
and prose, Adulterer's Anonymous, 

in 1984, the two women abandoned 
rock and devoted themselves to spo-
ken word. "Welcome to Sunday 
school," Lunch said, thus beginning 
an odd, powerful sermon. 

Lunch and Cervenka took turns 
reciting, improvising and bantering 
between themselves about topics 
which ranged from the political to the 
metaphysical. Lunch's loud, confron-
tational style contrasted with 
Cervenka's quieter, acidic lamenta-
tions. The phrase "Weird Sisters," 
which was used to describe the duo on 
fliers for the performance, was appro-
priate. Lunch and Cervenka could in-
deed represent two sexier, sillier ver-
sions of the witches in Macbeth, stir-
ring up toil and trouble of a different 
kind. 

Snipping gleefully at the threads 
which secure convention, Lunch and 
Cervenka attacked everyone and ev-
erything from the Pope to the Ameri-
can Dream. Among other apocalyptic 

visions, Lunch prophesied the com-
ingof a generational warwhich would 
result from poverty, violence and ba-
bies having more babies. "The real 
representatives of family values are 
the Menendez brothers," she said. 

By verbalizing the views of soci-
etal underdogs, Lunch and Cervenka 
painted a vivid picture of America as 
an urban wasteland fraught by loneli-
ness and spiritual destitution. But un-
derlying this dark perspective was a 
sustaining truth, expressing a justi-
fied outrage usually stifled or dis-
missed. 

It was rare to hear two wise, articu-
late women speak as loudly and as 
freely as they cared. Both seemed 
aware of the subversive potential of 
their work: "Someday I'll probably 
be summon'ed to the big house, ar-
rested for everything I'vesaido(done 
or they thought I'd done," Lunch said. 

"You'll be so popular there, 
Lydia," was Cervenka's reply. 

Mother May I 
Band doesn'tflinch at corporate sponsorship 

By Jeff Nlesel 
Hiatus Editor 

Some bands might think twice 
. about going on a tour put on by corpo-
rate sponsors like RollingSIOfU! Maga-
zine, Sony and Nike. But for Mother 
May I drummer Rob LeBourdais, The 
RollingStone New MusicTour repre-
sents a chance for his grQup, which 
will perform with Dag at 5 p.m. on 
Friday at the Price Center Plaza, to 
expose its recently released debut al-
bum, Splitsville, to new audiences. 

"I grew up in the '70s,soinasense, 
the commercial nature of the tour 
bothers me, but if you took it to an 
extreme, you wouldn't be able to do 
anything. If it really bothered me, we 
wouldn't be signed to Columbia, 
which is one of the biggest companies 

in the world," LeBourdais said during 
a recent phone interview from a tour 
stop in Houston. "It's nice to be an 
idealist and a purist, but how far are 
you going to take it? Everything is 
controlled by corporations. I respect 
Fugazi for doing what they do, but I 
don't necessarily want to do that" 

Mother May I was formed in Wash-
ington, D.C. in the early '90s by 
LeBourdais and vocalist-guitarist 
Damon Hennessey. AJthough Wash-
ington is known for a thriving punk 
scene which includes bands such as 
Fugazi and Jawbox, LeBourdais, who 
cited Cheap Trick as an influence, 
said Mother wasn't part of that scene. 

"The music we are playing now is 
kind of popular, but three or four years 
ago, it wasn't. I think we were too 

poppy for a lotof independent labels," 
LeBourdais said. 

AJthough his parents' encourage-
ment contributed to LeBourdais play-
ing drums when he was five, they 
haven't been as supportive since he 
joined a rock band. 

"Only recently, since we got 
signed, have they come full circle in 
support of the band. But I don't blame 
them. I'd do the same thing if I were 
them," LeBourdais said. "If my son 
wanted to be a musician, I'd probably 
smack him around for a few days 
because it's not worth it." 

Mother May I will perform with 
the South Carolina-based funk act 
Dag at 5 p.m. tomorrow at the Price 
Center Plaza. For more information,

Emerging Voices Festival 
Week-long programfeatures new contemporary music 

By Chl&-Un Simmons 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Department of Music's 
"Emerging Voices Festival" will fea-
ture an eclectic mix of performances, 
including Bang On A Can All-Stars, 
mathematically generated music and 
an "opera" composed only of a string 
quartet and percussion instruments. 

Assistant Program Director Keith 
Alexis said, "The main goal is to edu-
cate the public as far as contemporary 
music is concerned. What is contem-
porary music? Right now, contempo-
rary music represents sort of the un-
derbelly of classical music." 

AJexis said that UCSD was the 
ideal choice for the festival. "Most 
departments - they may have one 
maybe two people at most that focus 
on contemporary music. 'Whereas our 
whole department from the very be-
ginning, every professor, every staffer 
member, the goal is to be focused in 
contemporary music." 

The week-long festival will also 

feature seminars, symposiums and 
master classes with a noon seminar 
and a panel featuring music critics 
such as Kyle Gann, Jason Stanyek 
and Valerie Scher on Feb. 23. The 
lecture portion of the festival will then 
continue with classes and seminars 
by guest performers and composers 
on Friday, and then conclude with the 
Festival Symposium on Feb. 27 and a 
technology seminar on March 1. 

Miller Puckette, who joined the 
UCSD music department this fall, is 
one of the talented artists who will 
perform. With a Ph.D. in mathemat-
ics from Harvard, Puckette won Key-
board Magazine's "Software Inno-
vation of the Year Award" in 1990. 
"We're looking at the integration of 
computer, math and also music. That 
is one of the reasons why we' re so 
excited about this music-technology 
concert," said Alexi . 

Puckette will perform along with 
Vibeke Sorensen, a video artist, at 8 
p.m. on Feb. 28 at Studio A, Warren 

Lecture Hall. 
The festival will also highlight the 

Bang On A Can AJI-Stars, an innova-
tive group which features cello, bass, 
piano, percussion, electric guitar and 
the clarinet. The Bang On a Can AJI-
Stars will perform at 8 p.m. on Satur-
day at Mandeville Auditorium. 

The festival will close on March 1 
with a performance by the world-

reno'~{n Arditti String Quartet at 8 
p.m. at the Mandeville Auditorium. 
Receiving enthusiastic reviews from 
The San Francisco Chronicle and The 
New York Times, the Arditti String 
Quartet has received numerous prizes. 

AJexis said that the festival's most 
unique feature was "its inclusive-
ness ... we can have so many different 
types of groups that are literally night 
and day from each other as far a the 
actual performance is concerned. But 
you have them all under the same tent 
of contemporary music."

5404 or 534-4830.
