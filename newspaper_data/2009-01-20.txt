GRANTS ARE LATEST VICTIM OF BUDGET CRISIS ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

Tuesday, January 20, 2009

After months of planning, cam-
paigning, delays and controversy, 
undergraduate students voted last 
week in favor of the A.S. Council’s 
proposal to increase the quarterly 
activity fee last week by $19.82, 
raising the total cost per student to 
$143.46 per year. 

In order for the vote on the 
referendum to be valid, one-fifth 
of the 22,706 undergraduates cur-
rently attending UCSD needed to 
participate in the special election. 
This minimum was exceeded, as 
26.8 percent of undergraduates 
voted overall. 

Of those who voted, 3,426 stu-
dents voted to affirm the referen-
dum, while 2,620 student voted 
against it. 

Voters turned out in similar per-
centages from each of the six colleg-
es, with the highest number of vot-
ing students coming from Eleanor 
Roosevelt College and the least from 
Sixth College. 

No more than 30 percent of stu-
dents from any of the colleges voted 
on the referendum during the week-

long voting period. 
One student who voted against 

the referendum felt the council has 
historically mismanaged the quar-
terly activity fee, instated when the 

council was created. 
“In the past three years I’ve 

been at UCSD, the money we’ve 
been giving to the A.S. Council 
has obviously been going to places 

other than where they claim it has,” 
Revelle College senior Luis Garcia 
said. “Bear Gardens always run out 
of beer and pizza, and the money 
going toward Sun God has resulted 

in worse bands with every year. 
Where is the money going?”

STUDENTS APPROVE ACTIVITY-FEE INCREASE

UC Workers Arrested 
at S.F. Demonstration

In an effort to manage California’s 
budget deficit, projected to reach $42 
billion by mid-2010, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger proposed an $87.5 
million cut last week to Cal Grant, 
California’s principal, state-funded 
financial aid program. The cut would 
be made possible by limiting grants, 
decreasing aid to students attending 
private universities and terminating 
assistance to many students.

Currently, Cal Grant accounts 
for $880 million of the state budget, 
guaranteeing aid to all middle- and 
low-income students who meet speci-
fied financial and academic criteria. 
The grants also cover any tuition 
increases instituted by California 
State University or the University of 
California. 

Under Schwarzenegger’s proposed 
10 percent cut to Cal Grant, however, 
the state would no longer be com-
mitted to covering tuition increases,

At least 19 union demonstrators, 
including two UCSD custodians, were 
arrested in San Francisco last week 
after occupying the office of UC Board 
of Regents Chairman Richard Blum in 
protest of stalled wage negotiations for 
university service workers. 

Kathryn Lybarger, a gardener at 
UC Berkeley who organized the dem-
onstration, said that roughly 60 people 
gathered outside Blum’s investment 
firm, and that she was one of 19 who 
protested peacefully inside his per-
sonal office for about an hour before 
being arrested.

Police at the scene reported 22 
arrests on charges of trespassing. 

Lybarger said she and other work-
ers chose to focus on Blum because he 
and UC President Mark G. Yudof are 
ultimately responsible for settling the 
contract and bringing the university’s 
service workers out of poverty.

“We didn’t want to get arrested, 

but there’s too much here at stake,” 
she said. “The university is making us 
fight really hard for what are actually 
very modest demands.”

She added that since November, 
the university has ignored the union’s 
requests to continue negotiations.

In a statement, Yudof called the 
demonstration “inappropriate, disre-
spectful and a violation of Regent 
Blum’s privacy,” adding that the action 
was “potentially damaging” to con-
tract negotiations.

The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
has been in talks with the university 
since October 2007 in hopes of secur-
ing raises for 8,500 UC custodians, 
cafeteria employees and groundskee-
pers.

AFSCME Local 3299 President 
Lakesha Harrison said that at least 96 
percent of these employees are eligible 
for public assistance.

“The poorest workers on cam-
pus are still suffering, and it’s getting 
worse,” she said.

According to UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz, reductions in state funding 
have restricted the university’s ability 
to offer wage increases.

Victor Vacquier Sr., profes-
sor emeritus of geophysics at 
UCSD’s Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, died Jan. 11 in La 
Jolla from pneumonia. 

Vacquier, who was 101 years 
old, led a distinguished career 
that included the invention of the 
fluxgate magnetometer and mag-
netic surveying, both airborne and 
marine.

His work resulted in the dis-
covery of magnetic-field patterns 
preserved in the seafloor. During 
World War II, Vacquier’s fluxgate 
magnetometer was used from the 
air to detect submarines, and was 
later applied to airborne explora-
tion for oil and minerals. 

“What always impressed me 
about Vic was that, in addition to 
his scientific confidence, he was 
always so energetic and enthu-
siastic about the work he was 
doing,” Scripps geophysicist John 
Sclater said during a 1992 Scripps 
symposium honoring Vacquier’s 

work. “His interest in going to sea, 
ability to do high-quality work and 
to make it fun both for himself and 
for others was the keystone of the 
success of the marine geology and 
geophysics program at Scripps.”

Vacquier joined Scripps as 
a research physicist in 1957 to 
direct the geomagnetic program 
in the marine physicial laboratory. 
In mapping magnetic-field pat-
terns along the seafloor, Vacquier’s 
groundbreaking research revealed 
that vast tracks of the oceanic 
crust in the Eastern Pacific Ocean 
were offset at long linear-fracture 
zones, and led to the acceptance 
of the theory of plate tectonics in 
the mid-1960s.

Survived by his wife Mihoko 
Vacquier, son and Scripps profes-
sor Victor Vacquier, daughter-in-
law Judith Vacquier, four grand-
children and four great-grandchil-
dren, Vacquier held a renowned 
research career that spanned more 
than seven decades and included  
recognition in more than 50 scien-
tific publications, 18 patents and 
numerous awards for his revolu-
tionary work in geophysics.  

Memorial services will be held at 
Scripps Insitution of Oceanography 
at a later date. 

The number of students enter-
ing into continuing-education 
certificate programs at UCSD 
Extension climbed 28 percent over 
one year — from 2,362 in 2007 
to 3,023 in 2008 — according 
to Edward Abeyta, registrar and 
director of student services for the 
university’s extension programs. 

Overall enrollment for the first 
half of the 2008-09 academic year 
rose by 27 percent, with 27,463 stu-
dents currently at UCSD Extension 
— up from 21,571 in 2007-08. 

“For recent and mid-career col-
lege graduates facing a difficult job 
market and a troubling economy, 
continuing-education certificates 
are becoming increasingly attrac-
tive as a way to bridge employ-
ment areas that are in demand,” 
Abeyta said in a statement. “This is 
the second straight year with a 25 

percent jump in certificate enroll-
ment applications.”

The 10 certificate programs 
with the highest number of new 
enrollees are accounting, busi-
ness management, clinical trials, 
copy editing, human resource 
management, occupational safe-
ty and health, paralegal studies, 
project management, regulatory 
affairs for the biomedical industry 
and teaching English as a foreign 
language. 

Additionally, online certificate 
programs attracted 431 new appli-
cants from across the country, an 
18 percent jump from the previous 
year.

In order to accommodate work-
ing adults, classes for many of the 
90 certificate programs and sever-
al specialized study programs are 
being held during the evenings and 
weekends at the main UCSD cam-
pus, along with three other loca-
tions in Sorrento Mesa, Rancho 
Bernardo and Mission Valley. 

Certificates can be earned in 
one to two years, after students 
complete a set of required courses 
and electives.

Reade said that although he had 
initial reservations about the refer-
endum, he ultimately voted for the 
fee increase in order to preserve the 
quality of the campus into the future.

“Ultimately, I thought that pay-
ing the activity fee once before I 
graduate was worth it for the future 
of UCSD and my vision of it once I 
become an alumnus,” Reade said. 

A.S. Vice President of Student 
Life Darryl Nousome expressed 
relief at the referendum’s success.

“I am so excited that we can 
finally give student organizations 
what they want,” he said. “Now we’ll 
be able to make it though the Spring 
Quarter, during which the most 
funding requests are made and the 
largest number of students attend 
events.”

capping awarded funds at an unde-
termined amount, despite recent 
announcements by both public uni-
versity systems of possible fee increas-
es for the 2009-10 academic year — a 
potential loss of up to $2 million for 
UC students relying on Cal Grant.

“Details about this are not clear, 
but we think the proposal is to 
increase UC Cal Grant awards by 
only two-thirds of whatever the pro-
posed fee increase will be, rather than 
by the full amount,” UCSD Director 
of Financial Aid Ann Klein said. 

In addition, the proposal would 
limit financial aid for students attend-
ing private universities to $1,400 per 
student per year and discontinue the 
Competitive Cal Grant, which pro-
vides more than $100 million annu-
ally in grants to a total of 22,500 
nontraditional students, those enter-
ing college after an extended period 
of non-education, and second-chance 
students, those whose education has 
been disrupted by criminal charges, 
including 57 UCSD students receiv-
ing the award this year. 

According to UC spokesman 
Ricardo Vazquez, the university is 
concerned that the newly proposed 
cuts are just a starting point for fur-
ther cuts to the Cal Grant program. 
Vazquez said the university plans to 
lessen the impact of these cuts — 
which will affect the roughly 46,000 
UC students who currently receive 
aid from Cal Grant — with its own 
financial aid program funded by 
university grants, federal grants, 
private funding, endowments and 
33 percent of the revenue from stu-
dent fees. However, university funds 
would not make up the entirety of 
the Cal Grant cuts, leaving students 
to fund an average gap of $200 of 
each quarter’s  tuition.

“[The cuts] will definitely have 
an impact because the university 
continues to face budget cuts, and 
families and students continue to 
be affected by the national eco-
nomic crisis,” Vazquez said. “If they 
become a reality, the university 
would have to try to minimize their 
impact with its own UC grant aid 
so that financially needy students 
would see a modest increase in the 
amount they would need to work or 
borrow next year.”

Despite the university’s concerns, 
the governor deemed the proposed 
cuts a necessary solution to the  grow-
ing state deficit. In his 2009-10 budget 
proposal, Schwarzenegger suggested 
overall spending cuts of $16.5 billion 
— with Cal Grant constituting one-
half percent of those cuts — in order 
to reduce the current $42 billion defi-
cit over the next 18 months.

“The governor understands how 
difficult cuts will be but has a responsi-
bility to lead the state through this eco-
nomic crisis,” said Camille Anderson, 
deputy press secretary for the Office 
of the Governor. “The governor has 
ensured the full funding of the Cal 
Grant program each year since taking 
office. He doesn’t want to cut programs 
and he doesn’t want to raise taxes, but 
in the face of a $42 billion budget defi-
cit and with the Legislature’s inaction 
in passing a comprehensive solution, 
[the governor is] simply running out 
of options.”

In response to various state 
budget cuts to education, the U.S. 
Congress has proposed a $500 (or 
10.6 percent) increase in the fed-
eral Pell Grant per eligible student, 
raising the current grant maximum 
from $4,371 to $5,321.

Proposed Cal Grant Cuts Will Discourage Students, Deepen Debt

Workers’ Protest Is Legitimate Step to Recognition

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— When at least 19 University of 
California service workers and 
supporters were arrested in San 
Francisco on Friday for holding a 
peaceful sit-in at the office of UC 
Board of Regents Chairman Richard 
Blum, their cry for attention was 
quickly and predictably portrayed 
by the university as an immature, 
inappropriate step backward in 
achieving a compromise over wage 
increases.

As if officials were actually con-
sidering the workers’ demands, but 
now, given this wild display of irra-
tionality and invasion of privacy, 

they will regrettably be forced to 
teach their out-of-line employees a 
lesson by sentencing them to pov-
erty a few years longer.

UC President Mark G. Yudof, 
undoubtedly relieved to see some 
negative attention shifted off the 
university and onto the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, said: “Such 
activity is not only uncalled for, it 
is also potentially damaging to con-
structive negotiations and to making 
progress toward an agreement for 
our service employees, who have 
gone without a contract and the 
wage improvements we are offering 
for too long.”

By all appearances, the public 
might assume that the AFSCME 
underdogs have botched chances at 
seeing their demands met and wages 
augmented, lashing out prematurely 
and losing all hope by violating the 
privacy of an official crucial to the 
case. 

But the peaceful, sign-pumping 
pedestrian strikes that workers have 
held up to this point are — if the 
university’s delayed and lackluster 

responses are any indication — not 
near enough to bring around the 
changes for which they’ve so long 
been fighting. All that came of the 
hundreds-strong protests in June and 
July were sit-down negotiations with 
university officials in November, and 
even then, the university wouldn’t 
accept the recommended compro-
mise by a state-appointed mediator 
at the talks — a compromise that 
still barely satisfied union represen-
tatives, but with which they were 
willing to work. From there, protes-
tors at UCSD walked into the office 
of Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, 
demanding she more avidly express 
her support for their cause and push 
the regents to more seriously con-
sider the workers’ needs. Which, of 
course, amounted to a whole lot of 
nothing.

So, more than a year after 
demands were first announced, the 
UC workers are right back where 
they started. It’s a stagnant opera-
tion, in which neither party shows 
signs of budging. Where left to go 
but the bureaucratic desks on which 
something could actually be done 

about their contracts?
It’s been understandably diffi-

cult to maintain public interest in 
their cause, first announced back 
in October 2007, lost in a sea of 
economic complaints and losing 
even more steam when the univer-
sity agreed to draw up new contracts 
for patient-care workers in October 
2008, who had been protesting 
alongside service workers and were 
attended to more punctually for 
obvious reasons. After all, the uni-
versity draws huge profits from its 
medical branches, and there’s noth-
ing more powerful than the threat of 
unhappy patients.

So, though the UC has offered 
minimal wage-increase proposals 
in trying to appease increasingly 
unhappy service workers — spe-
cifically, an annual raise of approxi-
mately 1 to 1.5 percent, with no 
attention to the step-based wage-
increase system the union has long 
presented as one of its key demands 
— those bare-minimum solutions 
hardly remedy an average wage that

STATE NEWS — No matter wheth-
er it’s reflected in the elimination 
of on-campus programs or through 
our state’s attempt to reduce its debt, 
students have inherited a financial 
gray cloud of their own. And with 
the added weight of Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s proposal to cut 
$87.5 million from California’s largest 
state-funded financial aid program, 
there are rainy days ahead for stu-
dents who were promised free access 
to higher education.

Lending problems first arose in 
April 2008 when Mark Kantrowitz, 
a publisher of the financial aid Web 
site Finaid.com, testified before the 
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs that an 
estimated 57 student lenders stopped 
issuing federally guaranteed loans and 
19 suspended private student-loan 
programs. According to Kantrowitz, 

this represented about 13 percent of 
federally insured private loans and 67 
percent of consolidation loans for the 
2006 fiscal year.

The private lenders’ withdrawal 
was a blow to middle-income stu-
dents, considering those lenders sup-
plied about 80 percent of the $55 
billion to $60 billion in new fed-
eral loans made each year in addi-
tion to the $15 billion to $20 bil-
lion funded by private lenders in the 
form of private loans, according to a 
report by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Cleveland. Essentially, as private 
lenders dropped from the student 
loan market, so did access to non-
federal student lending. 

While President George W. Bush 
passed a bill containing provisions to 
ensure federal loan availability, the 
many students who need to fill their 
financial gaps with private loans in 
2009 will face difficulties. Standards for 
obtaining private loans have become 
more selective and Parent Loans for 

Undergraduate Students — money 
borrowed by parents to meet neces-
sary educational expenses, like hous-
ing and books — will be harder to 
attain with poor credit scores, accord-
ing to Ben Miller, a program associate 
of the Educational Policy Program at 
the New America Foundation. 

The most recent development in 
students’ already tense financial cli-
mate is Schwarzenegger’s proposed 10 
percent cut to Cal Grants. Although 
not yet official, this decision would 
relieve UC Cal Grant awards from cov-
ering the entire proposed fee increase 
for 2009-10 — leaving a potential $2 
million tab for UC Cal Grant students 
to pick up. In addition, the decision 
would eliminate $100 million worth 
of Competitive Cal Grants and limit 
annual awards to incoming private 
school undergraduates to a mere 
$1,400 per student.

If passed, these proposed cuts 
will create a domino effect, starting 
with private schools. As private loans’ 
availability and accessibility decreases 
alongside state aid, private institutions 
will deal with costs by cutting admis-
sions, diverting students to public 
universities and community colleges.

But the possibility that the 
University of California may both 
raise its fees and cut admissions by 
6 percent leaves no room or peace of 
mind to accommodate debt-wary stu-
dents, adding to its already oversized 
applicant pool and increasing finan-
cial strain. Although the Department 
of Education plans to increase the 
size of its Stafford Loan lending to 
make up for the decrease in private 
lenders, these efforts are just to buy 
time before they can find a perma-
nent solution to the problem.

Students who don’t qualify for 
these loans will either need to take 
out private loans with variable (and 
presumably high) interest rates (read: 
more student debt), get a second job 
or search for some other means of 
financial support. But the underlying 
questions in our shaky economy are: 
Where? And how? 

Even if Congress passes a 10.6 
percent increase per student to the 
Pell Grant — which is typically 
only awarded to students with fam-
ily incomes below $20,000 — add-

ing about $950 more per student 
wouldn’t be nearly enough to make 
up for the Competitive Cal Grant’s 
absence. Similar efforts proposed 
by university officials to combine 
several aid sources fall short (just 
$200 below the cost of tuition) and 
in the bigger picture, without com-
prehensive solutions to make higher 
education affordable for students of 
all socioeconomic standings, any 
attempt to cut budgets will simul-
taneously make a college degree less 
attainable.

Simply scrounging up some cash 
and saying that’s the best they can 
do for  broke students doesn’t change 
the fact that an increasing price tag 
undermines the university’s goal to 
provide higher education to all quali-
fied applicants. For students who 
think it’s tough to make ends meet 
now, college affordability looks even 
bleaker for the future.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

Dear Editor,
We are very grateful for the 

coverage that the Education 
Studies Program received in the 
Jan. 5 article titled, “EDS Minor 
Turns Students into Educators,” by 
Jasmine Ta. We are delighted that 
the Education Studies Minor and 
Partners at Learning programs were 
highlighted. 

However, we wish to provide a 
clarification to the statements that 
appear in the last paragraph. Ta 
states, “not all EDS minor students 
choose to go to the graduate program 
because of its limited options. The 
EDS graduate program only offers 
credentials for single-subject teachers 
in biology, chemistry, geosciences, 
physics, English and mathematics.”

In fact, we do offer single sub-
ject credential programs in all of 
these areas for students wishing to 
become secondary school teach-
ers. However, we also have a large 
multiple subjects credential pro-
gram (which is mentioned earlier 
in the article) for students wishing 
to become elementary school teach-
ers. Moreover, both the single and 
multiple subjects programs provide 
students with a Master of Education 
degree as well as a teaching cre-
dential. It is important to note that 
both programs also offer a Bilingual 
Crosscultural, Language and 
Academic Development Certificates 
(BCLAD-Spanish) option for stu-
dents wishing to become bilingual 
education teachers in California.

We also offer a two-year Master 
of Arts/Credential Program in 
American Sign Language-English 
Bilingual Education. Students, 
upon completing the program, 
have a Master of Arts degree (ASL-

English Bilingual Education), and a 
California Deaf and Hard of Hearing 
Specialist Teaching Credential, 
and a Preliminary Multiple Subject 
Teaching Credential with bilingual 
preparation in ASL. This is a nation-
ally recognized program that places 
graduates in schools throughout the 
United States.

Apart from the credential pro-
grams, we also offer a Master of Art 
and Doctor of Education degree in 
teaching and learning and a Doctor 
of Education degree in educational 
leadership, which is a joint degree 
with Cal State San Marcos. Many 
of the students who complete our 
credential programs, as well as those 
who complete credentials elsewhere, 
enroll in these graduate programs 
after they have had experience 
working as practitioners in the field 
of education.

Thank you again for the oppor-
tunity to provide these clarifications 
and for showcasing our work in 
education studies. For more infor-
mation, please visit our Web site at

falls at 25 to 30 percent below the 
average rate at other public higher-
education institutions throughout 
California.

“The UC executives get bonuses 
and raises while we’re trying to move 
beyond poverty wages,” said Kathryn 
Lybarger, a UC Berkeley gardener at 
the forefront of the union’s demon-
stration, one of those arrested on site 
(and later released) for trespassing.

In moments of such complete 
economic crisis, there is no doubt 
that everyone must sacrifice to keep 
our institutions alive. But to what 

extent should UC service workers 
— the majority of whom are eligi-
ble for public assistance, even while 
holding two jobs — be expected to 
sit back and take the heat for the 
state’s financial shortcomings? There 
is a certain standard of living that 
cannot be compromised, even if that 
means, let’s say, cutting a couple ben-
efits from above. As an institution 
of higher learning and understand-
ing, the university should recognize 
the need to bend over backward in 
maintaining a certain respect for 
the essential blue-collar base upon 
which we all rely.

Even if that’s unrealistic — 
because let’s face it, almost never 
in the history of the world have 
janitors and cafeteria workers been 
much of a concern to the budgeteers 
up top, much less amid a funding 
plunge as dire as this one — what 
do the underpaid and underappreci-
ated have left to do but protest? And 
when it’s as harmless a statement as 
showing up in the Man’s office, ask-
ing no more than to be heard out a 
second, the least we can do is listen.

dropped to $3,000 in 2006, and is 
currently only $20.

R esponding to America’s growing dependence on gasoline, the search for alternative energy has become an increasingly hot — and press-
ing — topic in both the laboratoy and the newsroom. 
What most of us don’t yet know, however, is that the 
very green, slimy plants we so ofen disregard on our 
local shores could very well provide the fuel for all 
the endangered road trips, plane rides and bus fares 
of the future. Scientists at UCSD’s Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, as well as biologists at the main 
campus, are currently taking new interest in algae 
as the most promising of alternative transportation 
fuels.

Algae, like all plants, uses the process of photo-
synthesis to absorb light energy, thus assimilating 
nutrients and absorbing carbon dioxide in order to 
produce biomass — up to 50 percent of the biomass 
resulting from this process is comprised of vegetable 
oil, which can, theoretically be refined into an alter-
native transportation fuel for our cars, buses and 
motorcycles. 

Research biologist Dr. Greg Mitchell, who has   
been working closely with algae in his studies at 
Scripps, explains that unlike most terrestrial plants, 
algae has the ability to yield a much higher quantity 
of oil, with 50 to 60 percent of its total weight com-
posed of stored oil droplets. 

“If humans need plant biomass, and we certainly 
do, algae is the most efficient organism in time and 

space,” Mitchell said. “Algae can easily produce 10 to 
50 times more gallons of oil per year than terrestrial 
plants.” 

The low maintenance conditions needed for the 
growth of algae lend it another advantage in the all-
important efficiency department. Unlike terrestrial 
plants, algae doesn’t need fresh water to grow, and 
can instead be grown in salt water on poor quality, 
nonarable land. Additionally, after its oil content is 
utilized, the remaining plant residue can be used to 
feed agricultural animals, freeing up land dedicated 
to livestock grazing. 

In order to expand the farming of algae into a 
mainstream project outdoors, on-land growth sys-
tems will need to be established on a much larger 
scale. 

“Thirty million acres would be enough to pro-
duce all of the transportation fuels we need and feed 
all of the pigs and chickens,” Mitchell said. “It’s super 
compelling, and humans ought to do it. I think we 
could be on the path for massive scale within 10 
years if society makes the commitment.”

And, indeed, 2009 started off with algae on 
the brain: Continental Airlines became the first 
U.S. commercial carrier to run a test flight pow-
ered partly by alternative fuels — more specifi-
cally, biofuel derived in large part from algae. The

FROM THE 
TREES TO THE 

HILL
F or the first time since their installation in 1986, Terry Allen’s “Trees,” an installment of the Stuart Collection, will play something other than tinny music and original poems writ-
ten by Allen’s son. On Jan. 20, passersby traversing the Eucalyptus 
Grove between Geisel Library and the Faculty Club will witness the 
trees, normally at subtle volume, broadcasting President Barack 
Obama’s inaugural address on full blast.  

According to a statement released by the university, Allen said 
it would be appropriate to welcome this new American beginning 
by letting his trees share the moment.

In addition to the broadcast, the UCSD community is invited 
to attend a number of on-campus events dedicated to showcas-
ing the historic inauguration, including open televised viewings 
at the Loft, International House and Price Center East from 8 
a.m. to 2 p.m.

However, not all students and alumni will be sharing this his-
toric moment from the shores of Southern California; according to 
university spokeswoman Christine Clark, several former members 
of the A.S. Council have received tickets to the event, including 
former presidents Harry Khanna and Marco Murillo. 

Khanna will be staying in Murillo and former student foun-
dation president Emma Sandoe’s Washington D.C. apartment 
while visiting the capital, along with UCSD’s Heidi Laidemitt, 
former Revelle College Council chair, and Adam Gardner, former 
Thurgood Marshall College senator. 

Marshall College sophomore Sean Quirk, who worked for 
the Obama campaign in Virginia over the summer and took Fall 
Quarter off to continue his efforts, has also traveled across the 
nation to take part in the festivities. Before officially campaigning, 
and prior to enrolling at UCSD, Quirk attended Camp Obama and 
helped form the organization “Silicon Valley for Barack Obama.” 
He joined “Students for Barack Obama” during his freshman 
year, and soon after lent a hand in forming student organization 
Progressive College Democrats.

“I kind of felt like I had to go [to the inauguration]; I would 
never forgive myself if I didn’t,” Quirk said. “It’s something I’ve 
been working toward for two years. After we won in Virginia

      UNCOMMONF O L K

S ix months after Revelle College senior Jon Dadon spent $500 of his Nordstrom employee salary on two turn tables and 
a mixer, he collected enough neighborhood 
noise complaints to earn an eviction threat. 
The problem: There was music at his finger-
tips, but nowhere to play it. His solution: If the 
party couldn’t find him, he’d find the party — 
lugging his 250-pound equipment to random 
kickbacks, introducing himself to the host and 
asking, “Hey, do you mind if I set up?”

And the random house-party venues do 
provide for quite the show. One such evening 
in Mira Mesa, somebody decided to put out 
a roach in a box of newspapers, igniting it in 
flames. As drunken panic ensued and people 
ran for the doorway, Dadon (who had admit-
tedly had a couple drinks himself) turned up 
the volume and soaked in the chaos — until 
someone slammed his laptop closed and 
scolded his enthusiasm for disaster. 

“I saw something going on and I started to 
feel the music and the fire,” he said.

Although not always involving spontane-
ous catastrophe, these cameos at improvised 
30-person events proved to be great net-
working opportunities, and have since led 
Dadon to such success as 3,000 person gigs 
at Rosarito’s Papas and Beer. 

Although Dadon didn’t yet feel like he has 
the skills to join a more experienced group, 
he wanted more. Five months later, in August 
2007, he collaborated with a friend in design-
ing music production logos that read SEM, a 
Web site-less, employee-less concept that at 
the time stood for Starry Eyed Music.

“That phrase, starry-eyed, stuck with me,” 
said Dadon. “It’s just kind of like being in the 
big spotlight. Like you’ve made it big time kind 
of deal.”

As flyers stamped with the Starry Eyed 
Music logo circulated at Dadon’s gigs and the 
brand gained momentum, he decided to bring a 
few others into the mix. He picked up members 
one at a time — other deejays, photographers, 
Web designers, promoters — always with the 
forewarning that he didn’t have much to offer.

“I’d say, ‘I don’t know what I can give you. It’s 

going to be more of an experience, and let’s see 
where it goes, and if you believe that we can try 
to make something together, then let’s do it.’” 

Although now composed of six deejays 
and four staff — including Eleanor Roosevelt 
College seniors Matt Antoun and Ben Cohen 
and Thurgood Marshall College alumnus 
Gianni Del Vecchio — Starry Eyed Music is far 
from your average business venture. Though 
the 10-person group competes with other com-
panies who claim $10,000 to $100,000 investors 
on music production, event planning, public 
relations and management, SEM members still 
have to pitch in for their own business cards. But 
considering Dadon financed business licensing 
and the startup out of his own pocket, money is 
the least of his concerns. 

“I was always broke and I’m still broke. It’s 
always kind of like, where are we going to get 
our next funds from?” he said. “But its not for 
the money, its for the music.”

For Dadon and other members of SEM, 
potential financial uncertainty and job inse-
curity come second to a career committed to 
good music and lively parties. 

“I think people make a big deal out of how 
difficult it is to commit to your passion,” said 
Dadon. “But especially in college, you have 
nothing to lose.”

The deejay collective’s event list is varied 
and eclectic, ranging from performances at 
On Broadway to crude desert dance parties 
in Palm Springs. Depending on set-up and 
clean-up time, group members can expect to 
put in a maximum 16 hours of working and 
partying for any given performance.

“We do the dirty work,” said Dadon. “That’s 
the only way you can make it happen.”

Starry Eyed Music’s ambitions do not 
stop here. Members hope to land more club 
residencies, rent an actual office for meet-
ings, travel more extensively and maybe even 
open up their own venue one day. In the 
meantime, though, they’ll hold an official 
company launch at Stingaree on Jan. 23.

Jan. 7 flight lasted approximately 
one hour and forty-five minutes, 
departing from Houston’s Bush 
Intercontinental Airport and travel-
ling over the Gulf of Mexico in what 
was reported as a perfectly smooth 
flight.  

Back in San Diego, there has been 
a strong collective push to bring algae 
into the public spotlight. Mitchell 
said that the UCSD biology depart-
ment and Dean Steve Kay — as well 
as the Scripps Research Institute’s 
Steve Mayfield — are planning to 
establish the San Diego Center for 
Algal Biotechnology in the coming 
months. 

“UCSD is in a position of lead-
ership in discovery,” Mitchell said. 
“That’s where discovery happens on 
the biology side. We are partner-
ing internationally and nationally to 
make sure that the San Diego region 
is a leader in taking things to the next 
scale.”

Graduate student Cameron  
Coates, who has been researching    
algae in Dr. William Gerwick’s lab 
for three years now, is working to 
increase the lipid, or oil, yields pro-
duced by algae, as well as to  develop 
a high-value products, such as phar-
maceutical drugs, from the other 
portion of the algae.

Since the process of growing 
algae is somewhat expensive, a com-
mercial development could be the 
key to offsetting the cost, making 
a possible drug that could be sold 
alongside the oil. 

“Algae can provide a lot more 
than just fuel to our society, which 
makes it a reasonable area to pur-
sue and research,” Coates said. “I 
think we have a lot of opportunity 
for renewable energy, we can get 
around our need for high-density 
liquid fuels, and the most sustain-
able way is algae.”

Coates, who said that San Diego is 
the center for algae biofuel research 
in the country, credited algae bio-
chemist Ralph Lewin as the pioneer 

for this type of research at UCSD. 
Lewin carried out the first govern-
ment sponsored project to develop 
biofuel from algae in the 1980s; and 
though the scientist passed away last 
November, the legacy of his research 
and accomplishments in the field 
are taking on a new life at Scripps 
and UCSD.

In the effort toward making 
algae as an institutionalized source 
of energy, Mitchell said that there is 
still much work to be done. In order 
to make algae a realistic option for 
national transportational fuel, the 
costs associated with growing the 
plant in mass must be lowered.

Revelle College senior Nathan 
Wright is concerned that biofuel from 
algae may involve more money than 
the average college student would be 
able to fork over.

“It’s a good idea, and that’d be 
great,” Wright said. “But if it’s more 
expensive, it won’t really fit in with 
the college budget.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more Kasuni Kotelawala, on the other 
hand, said that using algae as an 
alternative transportation fuel would 
give both our society and environ-
ment a much needed dose of healthy 
medicine.

“I think it’s essential right now 
that society starts focusing its atten-
tion on finding alternative resourc-
es,” Kotelawala said. “Because glob-
al warming is such a huge issue 
right now, using something natural 
like algae, could really cut down on 
pollution and harmful greenhouse 
gases.”

Despite ongoing research, algae 
as a source of alternative transpor-
tation fuel is more and more likely 
to become a definite option for the 
future, and new studies bring us clos-
er each day. 

“If we can get humans to the 
moon, I’m confident we can do this,” 
Mitchell said.

everyone was smiling in the streets, 
and you knew why. Just to feel the 
excitement again is going to be really 
cool.”

Quirk, the youngest staffer in 
his district (he turned 19 during the 
campaign), was inspired to enter the 
world of politics in part by the roman-
ticism of previous generations’ activ-
ism and combined with what he saw 
as a general apathy in today’s youth. 
But he said, times are changing.

“I felt like my generation wasn’t 
politically active enough,” Quirk 
said. “All the political activism in 
the 1960s on every campus, includ-
ing our own, was awesome — and 
I wanted to be a part of that now. 
On Nov. 4, in Richmond, Va., when 
we won, there were 1,000 people 
on Broad Street marching. It was 
exactly that, my entire generation 
coming together.”

When he returns to UCSD after 
the inauguration, Quirk is looking 
forward to participating in a new 
effort to bring students together 
politically. He will be helping to 
form a new democratic college orga-
nization, which will conglomerate 
the three separate groups College 
Democrats, Progressive College 

Democrats and Students for Barack 
Obama.

Back on campus, though she 
is excited about the large presence 
of UCSD students and alumni in 
Washington D.C., university repre-
sentative Clark also expects quite a 
bit of participation here — a reflec-
tion of the turnout on Election Day.

“Students were highly involved 
with the 2008 presidential election 
at UC San Diego, where the highest 
number of voters turned out for the 
Nov. 4 election in San Diego County,” 
Clark said.

Clark noted in a statement that 
signs around campus will inform stu-
dents about the inauguration events, 
an attempt to recapture the surges of 
political interest that the election first 
brought about.

Whether across the nation, sta-
tioned at one of several viewing ven-
ues on campus or gazing up at the 
trees in the eucalyptus grove, the 
inauguration of the 44th president, 
Barack Obama — arriving on the 
heels of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
— will not be easily missed by the 
students here at UCSD.

new CD, you’ll hear a mad mutt of funk, hip hop, 
lounge, pop and electronica, along with hints 
of Brazilian jazz and the kind of samba rock 
pioneered by ‘70s S.O.B.’s stars like Jorge Ben 
and Tim Maia. It’s to Curumin’s credit that he

Kari Elizabeth Hong: For The Bible Tells Me So: 
A Legal History of Religion and the Institution 
of Marriage - From early Christianity’s emphasis 
on celibacy to the Protestant Reformation’s 
rejection of the Catholic Church’s marriage 
fees, legal definitions have been tied to reli-
gious debates regarding who is pure enough 
to marry. In the United States, the concepts of 
coverature, anti-miscegenation laws, and no-
fault divorce were rooted in religious views 
and subsequently were altered as social views 
changed. Reexamining the modern fight over 
same-sex marriage through the true history of 
marriage law, the role of religion and the law 
intersect in ways that show that history truly 
is prologue. Free Admission. 4-5:30pm at the

TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

Sophomore guard Casey Ryan’s 
layup kicked off the 17-6 Triton 
response. Trailing by as much as 15 
points, Cal State Monterey Bay was 
able to score eight of the final 10 
points in the half, cutting its deficit 
to nine.

The entire Triton offense played 
up to expectations in the second 
half. Lawley and senior forward 
Brett Stuckey came out firing in 
the second half, combining for the 
first 13 UCSD points of the sec-
ond half and helping the Tritons to 
their largest lead of the game. The 
Otters went on another run, tying 
the game at 53 with 4:18 left to play. 
However, Kim assisted on a three-

pointer by senior forward Darryl 
Lawlor and then knocked down a 
shot from behind the arc to give 
the Tritons a six-point advantage. 
Kim and Lawley each converted 
three free throws and Husted added 
two in the final minutes to help the 
Tritons win.

“Every win is important, espe-
cially after coming off a losing 
streak,” Poppen said. “Although we 
came off a three-game losing streak, 
we had an excellent week of practice 
before the games.”

Kim led the Tritons with a game-
high 23 points, tying a career-high 
set at Cal State Stanislaus last sea-
son. Poppen scored seven with a 
game-high 11 rebounds. Lawley 

had 18 points, five rebounds and 
two assists, while Stuckey scored 12 
points on 3-of-4 field goal shooting 
and 5-of-5 free-throw shooting in 
nine minutes off the bench.

“We played with the sense of 
urgency of having our backs against 
the wall,” Kim said. “Coming off the 
past couple of losses we knew we 
had to get these wins this weekend.”

The Tritons return home 
next weekend, hosting Cal State 
Stanislaus on Jan. 23 and Chico 
State on Jan. 24. Both games are 
slated for 7:30 p.m. tip-offs in 
RIMAC Arena.

Strong Performances From Lawley and Kim Lead Tritons Past CCAA Opponents
▶ M. BASKETBALL, from page 12

1,039 on a defensive board 3:46 
into the second half. 

“It feels pretty good, but there 
are more important records I’d like 
to break, such as going undefeated 
in league and winning a national 
championship,” Osier said.

Head coach Charity Elliott was 
less modest in her praise of Osier, 
who broke the record, set in 1982.

“Michelle Osier is just a tremen-
dous leader, both on the court and 
off the court,” Elliot said. “She has 
put in the time and effort necessary 
to be the elite player that she is. She 
has made herself into such a com-
plete player and I’m very proud of 
her being the new all-time leader in 
rebounds in UCSD history.”

Friday’s game against Cal State 
Monterey Bay was another testa-
ment to the Tritons’ success this 
season. Ilg was first to fire things 
off for UCSD with a three-pointer, 
but the Otters kept it a tight game 
going into the half as a jumper by 

Gaskin and a layup by freshman 
center Lauren Freidenberg offered 
the Tritons a slim lead of 37-31. 

True to form, UCSD came back 
into the second half with its defense 
firing on all cylinders, stifling the 
Otters by limiting them to just 9-
of-29 shooting, down from 48 per-
cent in the first half to 31 percent in 
the second half. 

“Our defense is very team-based 
so there were a few rotations that 
we were a little slow on in the first 
half and I thought we sharpened up 
after halftime and limited them to 
tough, contested shots,” Elliot said. 
“We also did a much better job 
this weekend of giving our oppo-
nents only one shot and getting the 
defensive rebound.”   

According to Noonan, the sec-
ond half was all about fine-tuning.

“Coming out of the first half 
at [Cal State Monterey Bay], we 
realized that we hadn’t done what 
we needed to do on defensive,” 
she said. “Just the little things we 

weren’t doing were adding up. In 
the second half, we came out solid 
and played our usual tough defense. 
We put more of a stress of pressur-
ing the ball, denying passes and 
rebounding, which is what we take 
pride in doing.”

Already leading 39-34, a layup 
by junior guard Leilani Martin, a 
three-pointer by Ilg and a layup 
by Gaskin propelled the Tritons 
into their 21-4 run to devastate Cal 
State Monterey Bay.

 “In both games, both teams 
were quick to capitalize on any mis-
takes that we made — they attacked 
the openings,” Gaskin said. “So just 
like in many games prior to this 
weekend, we adjusted and tight-
ened up on defense. We also had 
to be sure to capitalize on their 
mistakes. With our defense closing 
off any openings and contesting 
every shot, we were able to force 
more mistakes, and then on the 
other end, we worked as a team 
to capitalize on their turnovers or 

missed shots.” 
Gaskin made seven of her eight 

shots from the field to lead the 
Triton scorers with 14 points and 
a career-high nine assists. Ilg and 
Osier also turned in solid numbers, 
as Ilg was 5-of-7 from the floor, 
served up a total of 12 points, 
five assists and two steals; likewise, 
Osier scored 11 total points and 
had two steals. The Tritons put the 
game away at 69-58. 

For the Tritons, winning all 
eight games against their CCAA 
rivals is a tremendous accomplish-
ment — but it also comes with a 
price. 

“I think there is definitely a 
bull’s eye on our backs now and 
that means every team is going to 
bring their best when they play us,” 
Elliot said. “We just have to endure 
their runs and keep fighting till we 
wear them out. We talk a lot about 
momentum and how we keep it and 
how we get it back when the other 
team has it.”

According to Gaskin, the 
Tritons’ positive winning energy 
acts as a constant motivator. 

“Now that we’ve seen what we 
can accomplish together as a team, 
we know we can do anything we set 
our minds to,” she said.

For Noonan, the prospect of 
going undefeated presents the team 
with both challenging and exciting 
opportunities. 

“Coming out of this weekend 
8-0 is a huge deal,” Noonan said. 
“There has never been a team that 
has gone undefeated in our confer-
ence, so the opportunity to make 
history pumps us up.” 

This week, the Tritons will 
put their winning streak on the 
line when they face the Cal State 
Stanislaus Warriors on Jan. 23 and 
Chico State University on Jan. 24. 
Tip-off for both games is slated for 
5:30 p.m. at RIMAC Arena.

TRITONS DELIVER MUCH-NEEDED WINS Women’s 
Basketball 

Keeps Perfect 
Season Alive

Dramatic Victory in Final Relay Puts UCSD on Top

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The Tritons 
shook off a disappointing stretch of 
games last weekend, ending a three-game 
losing streak with back-to-back road 
wins against Cal State Monterey Bay and 
San Francisco State. They defeated Cal 
State Monterey Bay 71-61 on Jan. 16 
in a game they never trailed, and then 
finished up their four-game conference 
road trip with a 66-59 win on Jan. 17 
at San Francisco State. With the two 
wins, head coach Chris Carlson’s squad 
improves to an 8-6 overall record and 
a 5-3 mark in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association.

The Tritons and Gators battled 
through a contentious first half, with 
UCSD holding only a slight lead at the 
break. The Tritons shot slightly better 
than San Francisco State in the half, 
converting 9-of-20 from the field and 
9-of-12 from the free-throw line. The 
Gators went 12-of-28, but got to the line 
only four times in the half, missing all 
four attempts.

“We had success this weekend because 
we were able to make adjustments from 
our past couple of losses,” senior guard 
Kelvin Kim said. “I felt like our offense 
was a little more fluid after a week’s prac-
tice … emphasizing ball movement from 
the inside out and mixing up our cuts to 
keep us from being too predictable.”

Adjustments and increased offensive 
efficiency were on display in the second 
half as the Tritons scored the first nine 
points of the period. Senior guard Alan 
Husted hit a three-pointer, senior for-
ward Shane Poppen scored in the paint 
and junior guard Jordan Lawley knocked 
down a jumper as UCSD built up a sec-
ond-half cushion.

The Tritons were again able to earn 
and make use of their chances at the free-
throw line, knocking down all  but three 
foul shots. Poppen’s layup with under a 
minute remaining in the game helped 
UCSD hold on for a seven-point win.

“During the second half we executed 

well on offense and played excellent 
defense,” Poppen said. “But, I believe 
that the most important reason for 
our comeback was that we out-
worked and were tougher than SFSU 
during the second half.”

Poppen’s 18 points set a new career 
high, as the four-year letter winner 
went 6-of-7 from the field and 6-of-8 
from the line, while also grabbing a 
game-high nine rebounds. Lawley 
led the team with a game-high 23 
points, adding a season-high five 
rebounds. Kim scored eight points 
with a game-high four assists, and 
senior center A.J. Maulhardt added 
seven points and s i x 
rebounds.

“It was 
a great 
team win,” 
P o p p e n 
said. “San 
F r a n c i s c o 
State was very 
physical and pres-
sured us very hard. Coach wanted 
us to attack them and that was 
my focus. I was able to get 
some good looks driving to 
the hoop, while also getting 
to the free-throw line.”

Poppen’s offensive 
improvements this season 
were on full display in the 
opening minutes against 
Cal State Monterey Bay, as 
he started the game with 
a dunk off of a Lawley 
assist and then knocked 
down a jumper off 
Husted’s pass to score 
the game’s first 
four points. 
Kim added 
a layup to 
give UCSD a 
6-0 lead. The Otters came back to 
within three after four straight points 
from junior guard Shaun Williams.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — 
“Success is addictive — especially 
when we do it together,“ senior cen-
ter Alexis Gaskin said. 

For the 25th ranked UCSD 
women’s basketball team, “suc-
cess” would be the precise word to 
describe the season thus far. Over 
the weekend, the Tritons picked up 
another pair of wins with a 60-58 
defeat of Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Jan. 16 and a 63-48 victory over San 
Francisco State on Jan. 17, extend-
ing their record to an impressive 
15-2 overall and a perfect 8-0 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

Down 11-5 with 12:07 left in the 
first half against San Francisco State, 
the Tritons scored 14 unanswered 
points to take the lead. A layup by 
junior forward Erin Noonan and 
a three-pointer by freshman guard 
Chelsea Carlisle brought the Tritons 
to within one. Following suit, junior 
guard Annette Ilg, Carlisle, junior 
forward Kristen Cabral and senior 
forward Michelle Osier each scored 
to put UCSD on top 19-11. With 
their offense firing on all cylinders, 
the Tritons all but put the game 
away by the half, leading 34-18.

The Gators sunk to a quick defeat 
early in the second half as UCSD 
put the game securely out of reach. 
Just four minutes into the period, 
the Tritons led by 20 and then went 
on a 15-4 run, increasing their lead 
to 61-31, which anchored a bud-
ding victory for UCSD. A tip-in by 
sophomore center Allison Westin 
capped UCSD’s winning drive at 63, 
while San Francisco State chipped 
away at its deficit late in the game, 
ultimately losing by 15 points. 

UCSD spread the ball around 
well in the game with nine different 
Tritons scoring in the win. 

“Most teams have difficulty with 
us because we are so deep,” Osier 
said. “We are a threat from every 
position. If one girl is having an off 
night, we can be sure that another 
will step up and get the job done.”

Noonan led the Tritons with a 
total of 12 points, hitting 4-of-7 
shots from the field, including 3-of-
5 from behind the three-point line. 

“In both games, we went on a 
run because we converted on our 
offensive opportunities,” Noonan 
said. “When we buckled down and 
played solid defense, we got deflec-
tions, defensive rebounds and steals, 
which led to extra opportunities for 
us to score and we converted. Both 
teams this weekend hustled the 
whole game, but we played smart 
and took advantage of the opportu-
nities we had.” 

Carlisle also had a strong night, 
scoring 11 points, dishing out five 
assists and pulling down a career-
best eight boards. Meanwhile, Ilg 
and Gaskin contributed eight points 
each.   

Not only did the victory keep 
the Tritons’ perfect CCAA record 
intact, it also marked a new record 
in school history. Osier surpassed 
alumna Mary Egan’s career total of 
1,038 rebounds to become UCSD’s 
all-time rebounding leader. The 
extraordinary moment came as 
Osier collected rebound number

SWIMMING & DIVING — In a 
stunning finale coming down to the 
final race of the day, the UCSD 
women’s swimming and diving team 
defeated the University of San Diego 
on Jan. 17 with a last-second finish 
to seal the event. Going into the 
400-yard freestyle relay, the Tritons 
found themselves in a hole, losing 
144-137 to the Toreros. Nothing but 
a brilliant finish by the relay team 

could pull off a win, and that is 
exactly what the Tritons were aim-
ing for.

“We were really nervous going 
into that last race,” senior captain 
Aubrey Panis said. “It was a really 
close meet up to that point, and 
we were really pulling for a strong 
finish.”

UCSD took first in the race with 
a time of 3:31.33 led by sophomore 
Anju Shimura, sophomore Ashtyn 
Douglass, Panis and senior captain 
Shannon Simonds. However, with 

the valiant finish by the Tritons’ “B” 
team, the meet ended decidedly in 
their favor.

“It was actually kind of anticli-
mactic,” head coach Scott McGihon 
said. “We pretty much knew what 
was going to happen after the first 
lap.”

It was a strong meet in general 
for the Tritons, who beat their cross-
town rivals for the eighth straight 
year.

The day began with a victory in 
the 200-yard medley relay, led by 

freshman Shea Kopp, freshman Sadie 
O’Brien, sophomore Jessica Ferguson 
and Panis. Shimura finished first 
in the 200-yard backstroke with a 
time of 2:06.33 — beating her Torero 
opponent by six tenths of a second 
— and second in the 100-yard back-
stroke with a time of 59.13.

After falling behind early in the 
meet, the Tritons retaliated with 
first and second place finishes in 
the 100-yard breaststroke — senior 
Kendall Bohn finishing in 1:07.62 
and O’Brien finishing in 1:08.16.

“At the first break, we had a talk 
with our team,” McGihon said. “We 
changed how they were swimming, 
and then refocused them for the rest 
of the meet.”

The teams raced neck and neck 
for the majority of the races and it 
was a contested meet up until the 
very last event. Neither team could 
pull far ahead of the other, and the 
meet was a good preview of even 
more competitive meets that lie in 
the near future for the Tritons.

“It was really good preparation 
for our conference finals and then 
the NCAA’s at the end of the year,” 
McGihon said.

Both the Triton men and women 
will go to work on Jan. 24 at UC 
Irvine where they will face off against 
the Anteaters and the Cal Baptist 
Lancers in a triple meet. UCSD 
hopes to come out strong in Irvine 
as the team gets ready for conference 
finals in three weeks.
