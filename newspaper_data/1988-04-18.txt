Mesa 
• repairs 

complete 
By SUSAN E. HYLEN 
C..,." 'III",. 

After five months of conflict 
between residents and supervi-
sors, repair of the leaking roofs 
at UCSD's Central Mesa Apart-
ments were finally completed 
last Saturday, according to 
Senior Superintendent of Hous-
ing James Gavin. 

Residents, some of whom had 
begun to wonder whether funds 
for the project had been mis-
allocated, still do not understand 
why the repairs were delayed so 
long. Many had been assured 
long ago by maintenance person-
nel that their rooff would soon 
be fixed. 

David Schlafman, superin-
tendent of Physical Plant Ser-
vices, said thai the postpone-
ment occurred because other 
campus repair needs had prior-
ity. 

While realizina that "it's not 
good for Obr credibility, " Schlaf-
man said' this occurs because 
after t!lf original analysis of the 
situation, "other projects become 
biuer problems.. .. The dollars 
are still there, but there's peater 
need [elsewhere ~ .. 

In late January PPS did initi-
ate emeraency repairs ofthe four 
buildinp at Mesa with the most 
severe leakage problems. 

In the worst of those cases, a 
ceiling collapsed last December 
under the weight of the water, 
whicb collects on tbe flat roofs. 
The student had to move into 
another apartment. 

Light fixtures of two residents 
(wbo wished not to be identified) 
filled with water and burst during 
a December storm. One of the 
lights was located over a baby's 
crib, but there were no injuries. 

A graduate student said large 
prbage cans used to collect 
leaking water had to be emptied 
every three hours in stormy 
weather. "It was very hard to get 
a lot of sleep," he recalled. 

For the emeraency repair pro-
ject, Gavin said he "put a con-
tractor right on it," rather than 
go through the University's 
normal process in which con-
struction companies bid for a 
project. This proced ure can often 
take six to eight weeks, Frank 
Goldston of Physical Plant Ser-
vices explained. 

Yet even the emergency repairs 
did not begin until two months 
after students registered com-
plaints. Gavin, citing last winter's 
stormy weather, .said this delay 
was due in part to the fact that 
the roofers "can't do anything in 
the rain ." 

Also, "it takes so long to get 
this project going because it's big 
money," Gavin explained. The 
University paid roofing com-
panies $80,000 for the emergency 
project and $400,000 for the more 
comprehensive project.

tral Apartment complex was not

Former justices ask 
for judicial reform

Was Robert Bork a victim of 
the media? Are judges really 
impartial? What qualities make 
a good judge? These and other 
questions were addressed last 
Friday by Frank Richardson and 
Joseph Grodin, former justices 
of the California Supreme 
Court. 

The lecture, titled "Judging 
Judges: How Should We Choose 
Our State and Federal Judges?" 
was part of the Ninth Annual 
Earl Warren Memorial Sym-
posium which honors the former 
U.S. Supreme Court Chief Jus-
tice. 

"Presidents and governors us-
ually nominate as judges those 
who are perceived as philoso-
phically at home or comfortable 
with the philosophy, attitude, 
and approach of the appointing 
authority ... it was ever thus, and 
perhaps will ever be," Richard-
son said. 

He added that although a 
judge is supposed to be com-
pletely impartial, he or she is 
almost always affected by par-
tisan politics. 

According to Richardson, po-

Firms' 'boom-or-bust' policies 
cause labor market volatility 
By TOM DEBLEY 
ucaps.., 

BERKELEY -America's 
labor market is much more 
volatile than most people think, 
a Univenity of California, Ber-
keley business school scholar 
reports. 

One in every nine jobs is 
destroyed and one in every eight 
is newly created each year, ac-
cordina to 10hnathan Leonard, 
associate professor and an econo-
mist in the School of Business 

Administration's organizational 
behavior and industrial relations 
group. 

"The aggregate statistics hide 
huge job losses and gains," he 
says. 

From the standpoint of busi-
ness, he adds, "when a company 
grows unusuaUy flit one year, 
the best bet is that it will shrink 
the next year: Firms seem to 
overreact to market conditions 
with an expansion and contrac-
tion, boom-or-bust pattern." 

Leonard's conclusions are con-

tained in his recent book, "Un-
employment and the Structure 
of Labor Markets" (Basil Black-
well Inc.). The book, co-edited 
with Kevin Lang, is a collection 
of papers by Univenity of Cali-
fornia economists investigating 
labor market structure, wages 
and unemployment. 

The enormous rate of job 
creation is a tribute to the entre-
preneurial abilities of American 
business, Leonard notes, and has 
contributed to growth in employ-
ment far higher than that found 
in Europe or Japan. 

But this fluid labor market is 
not without cost. 

Leonard believes that one-
quarter of the "natural" rate of 
unemployment is caused by fluc-
tuations in labor demand by 
individual firms. 

"When people think of unem-
ployment, to he says, "they think 
of plant closures, companies 
going out· of business. In fact, the 
death of firms only accounts for 
a small percentage of job destruc-
tion. More important is the 
continuous job turbulence with-
in ongoing businesses." 

Business managers can avoid 
the sharp layoffs of the boom-
bust cycle, Leonard adds, by 
resisting the temptation to over-
expand at the first hint of good 
news. He recommends alterna-
tives such as subcontracting to 
meet peak demands. 

The book of essays grew out of 
a 1986 conference to encourage 

See LABOR, pale 3 

litics has entered into the sup-
posedly impartial judicial realm 
throughout history. He gave the 
example of Hugo Black, a former 
justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court who, before his illustrious 
career on the nation's highest 
court, was a devout member of 
the Ku Klux Klan. 

Richardson, who served on 
the California Supreme Court 
from 1974to 1983, alsodescribed 
the current system for selecting 
appellate judges in California. 
This process has its roots in a 
1934 California constitutional 
amendment according to which 
a judge is first nominated by the 
governor, then confirmed by the 
three-member Commission on 
Judicial Appointments. The ap-
pointee then runs for popular 
confirmation at the next guber-
natorial election. 

Irked over the 1986 election 
which ousted Chief Justice Rose 
Bird and Joseph Grodin, Richard-
son gave three explicit sugges-
tions for improvini the process 
of appointing and retaining state 
Supreme Court jus~i~s. 

First, he said, Supreme Court 
appointees should face voters at 
the next g~Mral election after 
their appointment rather than at 
tbe next gubernatorial one. 

Also, he recommended that 
justices be elected to a full 12-
year term rather than to the 
unexpired term of their pre-
decessor. Under the current 
system, when a judge dies or 
resigns, his or her successor serves 
only the remainder of the pre-
decessor's term. 

Next, Richardson recom-
mended that after ' the first 12-
year term the judge be reap-
pointed by the governor and 
confirmed by the people for 
another full 12-year term. 

Former Justice Grodin, who 
served on the California Supreme 
Court from 1982 to 1987, was 
disgruntled with some aspects of 
the role that popular election 
plays in confirming judges. Re-
cently voted out of office, he 
admitted that his viewpoint is 
one of "the rat examined while 
running through the maze." 

One qualm was that when 
judges need to campaign for their 
election they are distracted from

Feramisco brings to UCSD a rich base of 
knowledge in microinjection. Using a sophisticated 
microscope and needle with a tip I j looth the 
diameter of a human hair, Feramisco injects living 
cells with oncoproteins, proteins produced by 
human cancer genes, causing the cells to become 
cancerous. By injecting another substance, an 
antibody that stops the action of the cancer protein, 
he has also successfully caused the cancr-rous cells to 
revert to normal.

cdlton; 

Dimmesdale 
The race for the A.S . Presidency has narrowed to 

two ca ndidates : Johnny Patterson and Maynard 
Dimmesdale. 

"Morning in America" wa Ronald Reagan 's 
campaign logan; Patter on's might be "Late After-
noon in America" - you know, after your classes, 
before dinner, when you're tired and don't feel like 
doing much of anything except taking a nap . 

Patterson is experienced and has managed what 
he's taken on well , but he stands for more of the 
same in the A.S. - more sandbox politics. The 
A.S. 's number one failing has been its inability to 
vis ualize an important place for itself within the 
University of California , from systemwide politics 
on down. 

As UCSD expands to an eventual population of 
well over 20,000, the A.S. has to care about more 
than just taxis and shuttles; we're traveling to an 
impersonal destination . We need to find our place 
no w, while plans are being made. 

Maynard Dimmesdale wants change and he's not 
afraid to take risks to get it. His campaign slogan 
might be , "Lively Up Your elf." Th is place needs a 
little livening. 

Smoking Filth 
Smoking is a filthy habit. 
A UCSD committee is considering a ban on 

smoking indoors everywhere on campus and at 
certa in outdoor places like the Grove Cafe and the 
Che Cafe, and the outdoor Revelle Deli tables . 
Further, the committee might ask that the sale of 
cigarettes be prohibited at on-campus stores . 

While they're at it, perhaps committee members 
ought to consider the banning of caffeine . Have yo u 
ever sat next to someone in class who's wired on 
three large cups of food service speed? 

And drinking: how long will we have to put up 
with people staggering out of the pub on a Friday 
afternoon, dragging through the mud UCSD's 
reputation as a sober and serious place? 

We can reform this school, make it just like, say, 
Brigham Young University .. . . We can even change 
the name: BYUCSD. 

We agree that smoking should be banned from 
indoor areas not large enough to establish separate 
quarters for smokers and non-smokers , but the rest 
of what the committee is considering strikes us as 
unnecessarily Draconian. 

There is no evidence that outdoor, second-hand 
smoke is dangerous in any way, or any evidence that 
simple courtesy - making sure wind doesn't blow 
smoke in someone's face - won't take care of the 
"problem" of smokers. 

Carter for State 
Speaking as part of his New York primary 

campaign Friday, Jesse Jackson announced that, if 
elected President , his choice for Secretary of State 
would be former President Jimmy Carter. 

Carter is due vastly more respect than he is given . 
He stands for an American nation that is part of 
- rather than roughshod over - the community of 
nations . He stands for a dialogue with peoples , not 
just governments; for rights , not just for inter-
national power politic strateg;es. 

He set foreign policy goals (human rights in Latin 
America ; peace between Egypt and Israel; getting 
hostages home safely) and achieved them (Argen-
tina; Sadat in Jerusalem; the safe return of every 
hostage seized by Iranian militants) . 

His conduct of foreign policy could not have been 
more d ifferent from the scattershot brutality of the 
Reagan administration. 

We commend Jackson for his choice; Jackson is 
reaching out to the best of the Democratic party. 
personally and ideologically, in choosing Carter.

Letters 

'Guardian' 
Slurs A.S. 
Editor: 

One objective I have as the newly 
elected Commissioner of Communi-
cat ions is to resolve the tension and 
conflict between the Associated 
Students and the campus media . It 
appears that you the Guardian , have 
little or no des ire to meet me half 
way in this matter. 

I take offense at the indirect slu r 
[Guardian , April II] regarding my 
unopposed candidacy. I realize that 
the existing situation i a precarious 
one due to the conflict of interests 
bet ween previous commissioners 
and the media on ca mpus . However, 
I resent the implication that I will be 
yet another in the "series of in-
competent communication commis-
sioners." To imply such a thing 
without giving me a chance to prove .. 
myself is both unfair and unprofes-
sional. 

It seems to me that what needs to 
be done is to work together to solve 
unresolved conflicts while being 
open-minded enough to work 
through those that may present 
themselves in the future . I fully 
intend to remain objective and to 
consider all sides of the issues which 
arise during my term. 

I for one am a little bit tired of the 
Guardian's paranoid delusions 
about their continual misrespre-
sentation in the Associated Students. 

If you feel this way, then perhaps 
you should consider recruiting a 
candidate whom you feel will better 
represent your interests.

Smoking 
Criminals 
Editor: 

I must say that it truly shames me 
that I live in a country where the 
freedom of all is no longer protected, 
but only the freedom of the mob is 
observed . 

Even though smoking has been 
proven to be bad for your health , it 
is a fact that mal"Y of the strongest 
advocates against smoking are those 
who jog on main streets inhaling 
more car exhaust than if they were 
to smoke a pack of cigarettes. It is 
also a proven fact that dangerous 
bacteria grow in ventilation systems 
even though smoking has been pro-
hibited in the area . 

Instead of treating smokers like 
criminals (which they are not!), why 
not work with them, why not create 
a room or area indoors where 
smokers can go in peace. Several 
smokers that I have talked to said 
that they would go to such an area 
instead of disturbing those who do 
not smoke in other areas . If an area 

like this was created, I can guarantee 
you that many who smoke would go 
there instead of to the eating estab-
lishments on campus (especially 
since the restaurants on campus are 
the only indoor areas which now 
allow smoking) . 

Please, I beg you, don't let the 
mob control your decisions . This is 
America; let us keep freedom for all 
and not the mob.

Save the 
Eucalyptus 
Editor: 

Writing an article out of purely 
sarcasti.c feelings without support 
fo r claims made is wrong. I am 
referri ng to an article by Robert 
Leone (Guardian, Feb. 29) in which 
he states, "We must rip out or cut 
down most of the eucalyptus trees 
and tend to those that remain ." In 
the article, the author asserts that 
nearly all of the eucalyptus trees 
located on the UCSD campus "grow 
in thick groves" and because of the 
school's negligence we have "weak-
trunk trees"that are "living deadfall 
traps". 

He clearly explains that trees 
grown in properly spaced rows are 
effective as windbreaks, which is 
true, but maintains that the eu-
calyptus trees planted on the campus 
are not. I don't know where the 
author of the article has been hiding 
all his time at UCSD, but anyone 
who has ever walked a dirt path

EdItor: 

If the Grmrdhln were truly an independent student 
newspaper, would tbe mind-boglina, embarrauina

It is becomin, increa.inJly apparent tbat the 
GlUlrditm is written by a few for a few and hal 
fOrJotten that it is .uppOHd to be the campus voice. 
An i •• ue in whicb nine of 24 papa are devoted fully to 
advertisin, and ei,bt pages are ICt aside for a not-very 
intere.tin,.tudent election is hardly ,ood journalism, 
much leu interesting reading. The deartb of new. 
storiel this issue included a front-paae article on a 
four-month-old con.truction project and a ramblinl 
account of a former student's hobby written three 
months alo. That's hardly news, follts. 

Which isn't to say there was no ne""" this issue: 
Buried on pale two was a tiny report of a man who 
was arrested on suspicion of vandalizing five can on 
campus. This isn't news? Hmm, perbaps someone 
should tell the Union, along with every other news 
organization in town, that they have it all wrong. 

The Guardian has had a long history of providing 
laughably bad Journalism to the UCSD community, 

With an the boots, C01U'IeI and lebolanbip oppor-
tunitiel offered, it" incredible that the memben of the 
GUllrdltln ataff haven' learned IOmethin, lOme-
where, 

Oace upoIl a time, the Gfllmlltm was a daily 
aewapaper, Thon IOmeone lot lazy and othen stopped

with the .. IDe editor for two ~ (when every odlcr 
campUi Bewspaper eM", editors yearly - IOIftt 
each term). the GlUlrdlllrt hat been caulht in a 
qua,mire. And the campus hu finally .topped 
rcadin,. 

A 10od. responsible and informative newspaper is 
what tbis campus desperately needa. What it dMlrt~ 
need is a newspaper tbat believes it should make 
political statements and feels that A.S. is or more 
importance than the San Diego City Council. I think 
of all this and I hope for a change. 

Perhaps the Guardian won't print this - self-
criticism has never been a strona point with the 
newspaper. But we'll see.

Q&A 
Do you feel the sale of cigarettes should be banned on campus? 

No. I think Ihat if people are 
really that interesled in nOI having 
people smoking around them, 
then there should be smoking 
and non-smoking sections in 
common areas where this hap-
pens. It:S nOI going 10 stop people 
from smoking on campus. The 
people who really want 10 smoke 
are going 10 go off campus 10 buy 
cigarelles, and Ihen bring Ihem

but notice that the trees were 
planted in rows, and not hapha-
zardly wherever there was soil. 

I assume where the author 
speaks of the danger of falling 
eucalyptus trees in his article, he 
is referring to one of the bigger 
trees south of H U L which fell in 
the last of the violent storms we 
had near the beginning of the

did not fall , but were ripped

apart from the incredible force 
of the high winds caused by the 
storm. 

Eucalyptus trees on the cam-
pus were not the only casualties 
of the violent winds . Many pines 
on the campus had branches 
ripped from them, falling dan-
gerously to the ground. The 
author suggests in the closing of 
his article that we remove the 
eucalyptus trees and plant the 
Torrey pine. Mr. Leone seems 

I don'l think it should be 
banned f rom campus. I Ihink 
cigarel/es should be available 10 
people so Ihey don 'I have to leave 
campus to gel cigarettes. If it is 
sm oking in Ihe dining commons 
they are worried about, Ihere 
should be designaled areas. A/so, 
by pralecling Ihe rights of the 
non-smoker, Ihe rights of the 
smoker are being violated.

quite biased in suggesting that 
only eucalyptus trees are in 
danger of falling during high 
winds . Maybe he did not see the 
fallen pine tree near the Biology 
and AP&M buildings after the 
last storm. 

Leone also speaks of the trees 
never being maintained . Both 
before and after the latest violent 
storms I have seen employees of 
UCSD pruning trees and raking 
leaves wherever necessary. 

I don'l Ihink Ihey have any 
righllo ban Ihe sale of cigarelles. 
I Ihink il S great Ihal they are 
making smoking-free zones. bUI 
just as much as non-smokers have 
rights 10 a sm oke-free environ-
ment. smokers have a right 10 be 
able to purchase cigarelles. Ban-
ning the sale of cigarelles is not 
going to StOP people from smok-

After making sweeping state-

one cannot help but being of-

Cacao-growing Indians got 
sweet deal from the Spanish 
By BOB ENGLISH 
UC CllpsltHt 

SANTA BARBA RA- Follow-
ing the delicious scent of choco-
late through the centuries, a 
young anthropologist is recon-
structing the history of the In-
dians of southeastern Mexico 
who grew and processed a cacao 
(cocoa) of such high quality that 
it delighted everyone from Aztec 
rulers to habitues of faddish 
chocolate houses in 17th century 

tomers from the Aztec elite and 
royalty, who mixed the powdered 
cacao with ground corn and chili 
for a drink often associated with 
ceremonies, to the Indian com-
moners, followed by the Euro-
peans," the anthropologist said . 

"The Spanish initially ex-
ported the aromatic, dark brown 
bean or seed to Spain where it 
was used as medicine, possibly 
because of the kick provided by 
its caffeine , Then someone 
thought of sweetening it- and 

Gasco speculates that it was a 
case of the Spanish leaving well 
enough alone. Here were estab-
lished and profitable orchards 
growing in a region of unpleasant 
climate- hot , humid and rainy. 
They were content to be the 
buyers and traders, where the 
real profit was anyway , 

Digging among the river stones 
that formed the foundations of 
the thatch and pole houses of a 
former colonial townsite in the 
state of Chiapas, Mexico, Gasco 
found shards of European glass 
and pottery in far greater quan-
tity than has been found outside 
the cacao-growing areas. 

This tells of a lively trade with

Europe. 
Jan Gasco, a researcher with 

the Social Process Research 
Institute at the University of 
California, Santa Barbara, said 
the story goes back at least 1,000 
years before the Europeans came 
to the Americas and extends into 
the 19th century. 

"For the farmers of these hot, 
wet lowlands, the Spanish con-
quest meant a change of cus-

hot chocolate was invented, now 
beloved by the world," 

The most distinctive fact about 
the Indians who made all this 
possible is that they retained 
ownership of their land after the 
Spanish conquest, she said. 

No cacao plantation or ha-
ciendas were created to turn them 
into serfs, Why did they fare 
better than so many of their 
countrymen? 

that began shortly after the 
Spanish conquest of the region 
'in 1524. 

As revealing as the findings 
fro,m the archaeological digs are, 
there's much they don't tell. 

For example , did direct com-
mercial ties with Spanish and 
mestizo merchants lead to rapid 
abandonment of traditional cul-
ture, including the native Mixe-
Zoquean language and ancient 
religious practices? 

For such information Gasco 
must turn to several remarkable 
archives in Spain, Mexico and 
Guatemala where colonial re-
cords have been kept safely for 
centuries, [QJ

8 Monday. April /8. 1988 

According to fCV"mer Justices Joseph Grodin and Frank Richardson. the media can be misleading in 
its representation of Supreme Court nominees. 

1986 election angers Grodin 
Continued from page 1 
their official duties and can be 
swayed by public opinion in 
order to be popular. Another is 
that there is a sense of impartia-
Wty created when judges are finan-
cially connected with persons 
who donat,e to their campaign. 

Grodin gave the example of a 
case in which law firms represent-
ing Texaco and Penzoil stood 
before the Texas Supreme 
Court. 

"Each of these law firms," he 
said, "had given tens of thou-
sands of dollars to the presiding 
judge's campaign." To correct 
such impropriety, he recom-
mended there be a strict limit to 
the amount any party can donate 
to a judge's campaign. 

Despite all this, both Grodin 
and Richardson said that it is the 
people who can and ultimately 
should be the ones who choose 
judges. However, as Richardson 
said, the public should be an 

informed public. He said too 
many people have been glossed 
over by the media , or pay atten-
tion to emotion rather than 
reason. 

In the example of the 1986 
California Supreme Court elec-
tion Richardson said , "There was 
an uninformed and unknowing 
electorate who seized on the 
death penalty issue and, angered 
by what it perceived to be an 
unwillingness by the judges to 
enforce capital pun ishment, 
easily swayed by emotional 
appeals, widely voted three 
judges out of office." 

Also dealing wi~h the role of 
the media, Grodin condemned 
its abuse, citing the hype sur-
rounding Robert Bork's nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court . 

"Without regards to the ques-
tion whether or not Judge Bork 
should have been confirmed, my 
discomfort, rather, is from the

process and procedure ... sur-
rounding his defeat," Grodin 
said. Grodin described the ad-
vertisements against Bork as 30-
second simplistic attacks, appeal-
ing to emotion, with no rational 
response made readily available. 

Despite this somewhat nega-
tive view of the media, both 
former justices agreed that the 
media have instrumental roles in 
informing and educating the 
public. This is crucial for the 
judicial selection process, since , 
as Grodin said, "The people are 
the ultimate authority." 

As for personal qualities one 
looks for in judges, Richardson 
said , "The predominant charac-
teri tics you would waitt are 
moral integrity and the intellec-
tual capacity to deal with com-
plex issues." In consonance , 
Grodin said that the personal 
qualities of honesty and com-
petency are the principle criteria 
relevant in selecting judges. [Q]

Riding on the 
Peace Train 
By AUTUMN EHRMANN 
GUllrdiu I"ter" 

If you walk through Revelle Plaza on Thursday, April 21, you 
might be in for a surprise. You won't see the familiar fraternity 
booths with clean-cut guys urging you to come to their Red Death, 
Green Fog or Blowout Beach Bash this weekend . You also won't see 
those cardboard voting booths we've recently grown accustomed to. 
You defi nitely won't see a quiet, empty quad . What you will see is 
UCSD's first ever 'Peace Fair. ' The.- theme of this event is "Bringing 
People Together," which is exactly what the fair organizers are 
hoping to do. 

Peace Fair '88 will not only be a place where veteran peaceniks can 
converge and discuss, but also a place where people who are new to 
the idea of peace activism can get involved , get info rmation, or just 
have a good time. 

The mood of the day should be upbeat, focusing mainly on the 
positive aspects of peace, rather then the negative aspects of the 
alternatives to peace. 

"We would like for students to get involved in peace projects and 
become a lot more aware of how they could contribute," said Teresa 
Wilkinson-Siefken of UCSD's Beyond War. 

"People have to know that whatever time and effort Jhey contrib-
ute to the cause is great. Just a small amount can help," Keith Abouat 
added. 

The Fair was developed jointly by the Students Encouraging 
Education and Development (SEED), the Beyond War Club, the 
Baha'i Club and various other peace-conscious groups. 

Peace Fair '88 is a non-profit event, funded by the UCSD Asso-
ciated Students Office, the Institute on Global Coflict and Coopera-
tion, Hansen's Sodas and various other on- and off-campus organi-
zations. Those wishing to help out or get involved with the fair can 
stop by the information booth at Revelle Plaza at 8 am the morning 
of the fair or call 534-UCSD for more information.

Peace Fair organizers are work ing to "bring people together" in the

THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO EOE 

By JACKIE KERMANI 
Staff Writ~r 

A. Thomas Hunt has been the 
lead attorney in approximately 
fifty major Affirmative Action 
lawsuits involving employment 
di crimination and fair housing 
class actions, Two of Hunt's more 
famous cases were fights for jobs 
for women, blacks , and His-
panics in the Los Angeles Police 
Department and the Los Angeles 
Fire Department. 

Hunt will be addressing the 
issue of Civil rights in a speech to 
be given here at UCSD next 
week, 

The litigation in Hunt 's suit 
against the L.A, Police Depart-
ment cla imed that there was 
discrimi nation within the depart-
ment in hiring, recruiting, testing 
procedures , and height require-
ments. Hunt won the case in 
1981 when the ninth Circuit 
Court required that 45 percent of 
the Police Department's new 
recruits be minorities until the 
department's census became 12 
percent black and 22 percent 
Hispanic. Also, 25 percent of the 
new officers were to be women 
until a 20 percent rate was 
reached . 

"[This] was the biggest employ-
ment discrimination case ever 
litigated in California" Hunt 
noted , and now "employers know 
they can not [legally] exclude 
minorities and women." 

The Fire Department case was 
a similar type of class action 
lawsuit. The court requested a 
quota of20 percent black and 20 
percent Hispanic employees. The 
Fire Department complied and 
actually hired "25 percent of each 
group," remarked Hunt. 

"The importance of this case 
was that it was the first major 
Affirmative Action case in South-
ern California," Hunt said , 

Inspired by Martin Luther 
King's "I Have A Dream" speech, 
Hunt said that the only way of 
achieving happiness is to 
promote and ensure equal rights 
for minorities , women, and 
children. 

Hunt feels that the most prob-
lematic aspect of civil rights 
nationally is that the Reagan 
Administration is fighting Affir-
mative Action in education and 
employment despite the Supreme 
Court's ruling that its goals and 
timetables are appropriate. Hunt 
believes the biggest change 
needed is federal government en-

dorsement of Affi rmative Action 
programs, 

Hunt , who received his law 
degree f rom Harvard , ha s 
worked in everal diver e areas , 
He has been a lecturer of Law in 
Africa and he has worked for the 
Civil Rights Division of the 
United States Department of Jus-
tice. 

Hunt has received numerous 
awards and honors, In 1972 he 
received a Special Achievement 
Award from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice; in 1974and 1977 
the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission presented 
him the Special Achievement 
Award for Private Practioners; 
and in 1988 he was the recipient 
of the Fair Housing Award , 

Hunt's lecture at UCSD, titled 
"Civil Rights in America," will 
be a philosophical and practical 
analysis of the pros and cons of 
Affi rmative Action in the fields 
of employment and education. 
Hunt will also give an a nalysis of 
the Reagan Administration's 
position on Affirmative Action, 
The lecture will be held on 
Thursday, April 21 , from 5:00-
6:00 pm in Peterson Hall, Room 
103, and is sponsored by UCSO's 
Democratic Club. [Q]

Women's tennis still No.1; 
beats Claremont, Oxy 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

Despite the cold and wet 
weatherthis weekend, the UCSD 
women's tennis team managed 
to pull off two victories against 
key D ivision 111 opponents 
Claremont-Mudd and Occiden-
tal Colleges. 

The Saturday, April 16 match 
against Occidental, a rematch of 
last year's National finalist s, 
proved to be not much of a chal-
lenge for the defending cham-
pionship lady Tritons (15-4) as 
they cruised to an 8-1 win . 

No . 1 seed Christ ine Behrens 
continued to dominate her Div-
ision III competition with a 6-2, 
7-6 win over Harriet Wilcox. 

Julie Berman had to work for 
her three-set win over K.endal 
Junta (2-6, 6-3, 7-6). Everything 
Berman hit as a put-away shot 
Junta seemed to get to , leading 

only to frustration . By the third 
set , though , Berman appeared to 
get a second wind that Junta 
could not keep up with . Berman 
won the tie-breaker 7-5. 

Team captain Rhonda Meier 
took care of Occidental's Kiki 
Roc quickly, 6-3 , 6- 1. Susan 
Mitchell , playing on taped legs, 
used consistent rallies and put-
aways to take Sandy Shutz in 
two sets, 6-3 , 6-3. 

Kristen Diels, playing in the 
No. 5 spot due to an injury to 
usual No. 5 seed Janet Whalen, 
took Jenny Olson in two sets. 
Tritons Susan Carney and No . 7 
seed Richette Lock also took 
their Occidental opponents in 
two sets, 6-3 , 6-3 and 6-2, 6-4 
respectively. 

In doubles, Behrens and Meier 
defeated Wilcox and Roc in two 
sets, 6-1 , 6-3. Diels and Carney 
continued their success as the 
No. 3 doubles team with a two-

set win over Shutz and K.ellie 
Wiggin, 6-1 , 6-3. Occidental's 
Junta got even better during the 
doubles match and managed to 
take the only Oxy victory with 
partner Harris over the No. 2 
team of Lock and Berman, 2-6, 
3-6. The doubles match was 
Berman's first since last year. 

Against Claremont on April 
15 , the lady Tritons took five of 
the six matches and two of three 
doubles matches, winning the 
match 7-2. 

No. I seed Behrens again dom-
inated her Division III competi-
tion with a 6-2, 6-0 win over 
Claremont's Jennifer Lee. Ber-
man took Christ ina Booth in 
three sets, 6-3, 4-6, and 6-4. Meier 
came close but couldn't quite 
catc h Rache l Yeaman for 
UCSD's only loss in singles, 4-6, 
5-7. Mitchell defeated Heather 
Holben in three sets, 6-3, 2-6, 7-

Novice crews show hope in 
'Mission Bay' grudge meet 
By RICHARD CRAIG 

In Sunday's regatta against strong local 
units USD and SDSU, UCSD crew, a 
beleaguered group in recent times, showed 
that the future may hold promise. 

In the annual grudge match for the 
"bragging rights for Mission Bay," the 
Triton rowers made great strides toward 
regaining lost respectabil ity , particularly 
in the novice ranks , indicating that pros-
perous times may be on the horizon for 
both the men and women . 

The women's team met and exceeded 
the hopes of coach Jack Vallerga, with 
the novice lightweight crew taking first 
place and the team as a whole finishing 
very comparably to more highly-regarded 
USD and SDSU. 

showing by the novices now looks "brigh-
ter than we could have hoped for co ming 
in" to Sunday's competition. 

Coach Mike Shannon's men , despite 
some disappointments in the so-called 
"prestige races ," were heartened by the 
success of their novices, who took the title 
in their division with a superior perfor-
mance. 

With the varsity having been hit hard 
with illness, Coach Shannon had been 
forced to rebuild the team "from the 
ground level up ," taking on the novices 'as 
his pet project. Their success in both the B 
and C races was a great reward for a lot of 
hard work , and gives the program a shot 
in the arm at a time when one is greatly 
welcomed. 

Jonahu't / Gua,dian 

After finishing third last year , their 
worst showing in 13 years , this year's 
result was "very encouraging," according 
to Vallerga , showing great progress but 
" not so much that there is no room for 
improvement." He added that the strong 

With Sunday's strong showings of both 
the novice men and women, the near 
futu re of the Triton rowers looks promis-
ing, as the gap between UCSD and the 
other local school closes and the hard-
working, caring people involved in the 
program regain some lost pride. [QJ 

Double trouble - The UCSD women's softball team improved their record 
to 26-5-1 this weekend with four wins in two doubleheaders. Stacy Sasaki and 
Pally Hurtt pitched 7 -4 and 1 0-0 victories ove r La Verne and 5-1 and 4-3 wins 
over Redlands, respect ively.

SPORTS 

Major League Comrnentary-
The W>rld lS Still Mets to make it;Cubs to cry The Greatest ""'~.&. 

By MIKE MARTINEZ 
St4// Writer 

Those successful Oakland ball 
teams of the early 70s , and the 
tater Yankees of the original Billy 
Marlin era, proved that the team 
that frays together bathes to-
gether - in champagne, that is . 
Both ofthose teams were led by a 
disruptive , egotistical superstar 
whose abrasive personatity kept 
him from being truly a team 
leader, other than by example in 
clutch situations. We're speak-
ing, of course, of Reggie Jackson, 
the quintessential 70s sports 
hero; the media superstar and 
clutch hitter; a happening waiting 
for a situation. Because of him, 
and in spite of him, his teams 
won. 

lf we have an 80s equivalent, 
it's the Rap Master himself, 
Darryl Strawberry of the New 
York Mets . He, too, is temper-
mental, spoiled and self cen-
tered , with less swagger and more 
pout. The Straw loves to talk, 
and not just behind closed doors. 
His recent tantrum in Esquire 
added even more enemies to his 
formidable list. But one of these 
seasons he'l hit 40 home runs 
and steal 40 bases . Or maybe, if 
the stars are properly aligned, 
he'l go for 50 and 50. Like 
Reggie in his prime, though 
Darryl will never be looked on as 
a team leader, his talents will be 

irreplaceable. 
So the backbiting and rancor 

that wins pennants is back in 
Gotham. Let's not forget that 
they totally dominated the league 
just two years ago, and that the 
everyday lineup has ac tually im-
proved. In every area but the 
bullpen the Met s stand taller 
than any other team in the East. 
How about these ~starters : 
Dwight Gooden, ready for a 
distraction-free year; Ron Darl-
ing, who had a good spring; AIl-
Star Sid Fernandez; a healthy 
Bobby Ojeda; a nd unsung hero 
Rick Aguila. A lineup with 
Hernandez, Carter , McRey-
nolds, HoJo and the ubiquitous 
Strawberry will score early and 
often. With all its power, pitch-
ing, and a manager who can 
handle volatile personalities, the 
Mets could win with Ed Koch in 
the pen . 

Was the surprising 92-win 
season of the '87 Montreal Expos 
a mirage? Maybe not, yet they 
may top that in '88 aftd st ill finish 
second! Former Oriole Dennis 
Martinez and former thug Pas-
cual Perez are for real (yes, 
believe it) and Floyd Youmans 
should have less trouble keeping 
track of his drinks this season. 
These three starters, and a bull-
pen-by-committee (led by Tim 
Burke) gives les Expos good 
pitching. Everyone knows that

Commentary 
Continued (rom pale 13 
Raines is a stud and that Tim 
Wallach and Hubie Brooks can 
hit. Fewer know that first base-
man Andres Gallaraga should be 
starting this year's All-Star game 
and that Mitch Webster is a 
smart hustler. 

Last year's champs, the St. 
Louis Cardinals, will show de-
spite the division's best manager 
Whitey Herzog and best bullpen 
tandem in Todd Worrell and 
Ken Dayley. Whitey had some 
nice starters in Magrane, Cox, 
Tudor, Matthews and Forsch, 
but one may be expendable if 
new righthander Jose !)eLeon 
develops past the would-be stage. 
They lost of~injured Jack Clark, 
but replaced him with injury-
prone Bob Horner, back from a 
tour of the Orient . And speaking 
of injuries, why do the St. Else-
where Cards suffer so many? 
Their opening day DL had 
Tudor, Tunnell, Morris and Laga 
on it . Ozzie Smith, Willie McGee 
and Terry Pendelton give them 
stellar defense , and so the birds 
have a little bit of everything. 
Not enough to take it all, how-

ever. 
One of the league's most im-

proved teams in the second half 
of'87 was the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
who should improve to fourth 
place. Their ga ng of young slug-
gers, potential arms and pesky 
garners is about a year away 
from the true adrenaline rush of 

the pennant race. They're kind of 
like the Twins were in '82, with a 
nucleus of young talent ready to 
gell . Last year they sent fading 
catcher Tony Pena to the Cards 
in exchange for Mike La Valliere, 
Andy Van Slyke and Mike 
Dunne in one of the greatest 
swindles of all time. Dunne was 
the league's top rookie pitcher, 
and lefty re liever John Smiley 
was a hot topic in the smoke-
filled rooms of the winter meet-
ings. The Dodgers even offered 
Pedro Guerrero for him - even 
up! Bobby Bonilla is the 'new' 
Tim Wallach - that is, the good-
hit third baseman no team can 
ever seem to come up with , and 
who every team wants to land in 
an off-season deal. Only two 
reliable starters and more bullpen 
help keeps the Bucs from being 
contenders. 

They should definitely beat 
out the Philadelphia Phillies, 
who are strictly Palookasville. 
This team had trouble scoring 
with a lineup of Von Hayes, Ron 
Samuel, ageless Mike Schmidt, 
Lance Parrish, and a couple of 
other bantamweights. The addi-
tion of ex-Mariner Phil Bradley 
may help, but their pitching starts

Baseball 
Continued from paae 14 
wit h Shane Rawley a nd end s 
with S teve Bed rosian (who'l miss 
the fi rst mo nth). They a re a lso 
hampered by the move of brain-
less manager Lee Elia - he of 
that stale "Good 01' Boys" fra -
ternity tha t d oles out the avail -
able managing jobs. 

Why, what an appropriate 
lead-in to the subiect of Don 
Zimmer - the dean emeritus of 
the GOBs and field boss of the 
C hicago Cubs. In light of base-
ball's supposed desire to promote 
black 'movers and shakers ' , the 
lazy hiring of an old school re-
t read like Donnie Zimmer (by 
his pal GM Jim Frey, himself a 
GOB) is shameful indeed . He 
deserves the loser he's saddled 
with , a team of beautiful 
strengths yet crippling defects . 

With Andre Dawson, steady 
Ryne Sandberg and Jody Davis, 
streaky Leon Durham, and ready-
to-bust-out Shawon Dunston , 
the hitting stats will soar in little 
Wrigley. The pitching may wal-
low with p igs, and there's un-
certainty at every turn. Mr. Good 
Year I Bad Year, Rick Sutcliffe, 
will pitch with a bone spur in his 
left heel that will eventually affect 
his mechanics. The Goose may 
save a few for Sutcliffe , but what 
of the rest of the week? The Cu bs 
gave up proven reliever Lee 

Smith for Calvin chi ra ld i a nd 
AI Nipper. Why? Cal cou ldn 't 
get a clutch out in ni ntendo ba ll . 
a nd a ll Ni pper 's ever d one of 
note was plun k our pal Darryl 
Strawberry in a spring tra ining 
game. 

Well, Cub fa ns can look for-
ward to the first Nipper-S traw-
be rry co nfronta t io n a nd C hi-
cago's entry int o the twentieth 
century with n ight base bal l. 
These will be about the only Cub 
highlights fo r '88 in the city of 
bruised shoulders. [Q]
