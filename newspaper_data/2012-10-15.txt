SURF REPORT

Freshmen Guaranteed Four 
Years of  On-Campus Living

housing & dining

By Emily pham 
Staff Writer

For the first time, UCSD is offer-
ing guaranteed housing to incoming 
freshmen for four years. According to 
UCSD spokesperson Christine Clark, 
this year’s incoming transfer students 
are also guaranteed two-year hous-

ing. 
UCSD is the first school in the 

UC system to offer the four-year 
guarantee. The on-campus housing 
guarantee has always been offered to 
freshmen, but the length of the guar-
antee has varied historically from 
each class of freshmen, according 
to Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
(HDH) Director Mark Cunningham. 
For example, while the class of 2012 
was guaranteed three-year housing, 
this year’s incoming freshmen guar-
anteed four-year housing. 

The four-year guarantee is not 
extended to sophomores, juniors and 

seniors, but they are still eligible to 
apply for on-campus housing for as 
long as they are enrolled part-time or 
full-time at UCSD.

“The length of 
the offered guaran-
tee is a function of 
housing supply and 
student demand,” 
Cunningham said. 
“Over the years, the 
campus extended 
housing guarantee has ranged from 
no guarantee to the four-year guar-

UCSD Hosts Mayoral Debate

San Diego mayoral candidates Carl DeMaio and Bob Filner made their case for election in 
a debate at UCSD last Saturday, Oct. 
13. The event was hosted by Student 
Organized Voter Access Committee 
(SOVAC), a UCSD org, and co-spon-
sored by XETV-TV.

The debate took place in Price 
Center East Ballroom and featured 
questions from a panel of UCSD 
students. The hour-long event aired 
Saturday at 9 p.m. and Monday at 9 
a.m on XETV-TV. 

The public event was moderated 
by Heather Myers from XETV-TV, 
who asked each candidate a series of 
questions focusing on innovation, sus-
tainability and civic engagement in San 
Diego. The candidates had a minute 
and a half to answer the questions, fol-
lowed by a 30-second rebuttal.

DeMaio, a Republican San Diego 
city councilmember, discussed his 
plans to make San Diego the most 
innovative economy. 

“Getting San Diegans back to work 
is a top priority,” DeMaio said.

DeMaio also said he wants to cre-
ate stronger after-school programs 
and improve job prospects for college 
graduates in San Diego.

Filner, a 10-term Democratic con-
gressman for the 51st district by the 
border, explained his ideas to improve 
water sustainability while working 
toward a green economy. 

“Let’s combine the green energy 
economy and a blue energy economy,” 
Filner said. “We have a responsibility 
to shift toward a blue and green econ-
omy and create jobs in that economy.”

Filner stated that one of the first 
things he will do as mayor is make sure 

all public buildings are solar-powered 
within the first five years.

DeMaio debated the importance 
of academic excellence and preparing 
students in science, technology and 
mathematics to make the San Diego 
region more competitive. 

“We have to prepare the work force 
to fill those 21st century jobs,” DeMaio 
said.

When asked about his plans to 
improve transportation, DeMaio 
emphasized the importance of having 
both quality roads and public transit. 
His mobility plan focuses on redesign-
ing San Diego streets and creating 
walkable lanes.

Filner plans to make all communi-
ties pedestrian and biker-friendly by 
fixing broken roads and building bike 
lanes in attempt to improve the overall 
quality of life in San Diego. 

“We need a real bike infrastruc-
ture,” Filner said. “Let us really work on 
a system that can work.”

Filner also plans on increasing the 
budget for arts and culture in schools 
to motivate student involvement as 
well as create an urban community. He 
plans to promote student involvement 
in city decision making, and include 
them in political and economic deci-
sion making by creating internship 
opportunities for university students 
across San Diego.

DeMaio wants to bring in gradu-
ate and undergraduate students to 
get involved in the community, and 
strengthen the ties between local uni-
versities to assure their activeness in 
San Diego’s economic future.

Later this month, First Lady 

Michelle Obama will return to 
San Diego for the third time since 
her husband assumed presidential 
office. She will be hosted by Joan 
and Irwin Jacobs in their La Jolla 
home and will headline a breakfast 
fundraiser for President Obama’s 
“2012 Victory Fund” on Oct. 26. 

The breakfast costs $1,000 
per person, but having a 
photo taken with Mrs. Obama 
raises the price to $5,000.  
   Other local political figures, such 
as Ellen and David Dolgen and 
Elaine and Murray Galinson, will be 
in attendance.

A 23-year-old woman died 

Saturday morning after being hit by 
a car near UCSD.

The woman and a friend were 
crossing La Jolla Village Drive around 
1:30 a.m. when another woman, driv-
ing a Toyota Corolla, struck the pedes-
trian, who died of injuries at the scene. 

The victim’s name will not be 
released until  her family is notified.
Police told NBC San Diego that the 
pedestrian may have been intoxicated, 
but are waiting for a medical examina-
tion to confirm. 

Police also believe that the driver 
had a green light, and are currently not 
holding her at fault.

year’s incoming fresh-person class,” 
Cunningham said.

According to Cunningham 
and Clark, the number of students 

interested in living on campus has 
increased to 12,574 students, and 
Cunningham expects that the num-
ber will continue to increase and that 
HDH will respond to the increasing 
demand. Clark said that this is the 
largest number of students ever to be 

housed at UCSD’s on-campus hous-
ing buildings.

“We expect this trend to con-
tinue,” Cunningham said. “If the 
demand for on-campus housing con-
tinues to increase, it is possible more 
housing might be built.”

The UCSD housing capac-
ity has nearly doubled, according 
to Cunningham, while the price 
for living on campus has steadily 
increased. The 2010-11 estimated 
budget for room and board was 
$11,522, $11,571 in 2011-12 and

Flores, told a crowd of around 20 stu-
dents that California state divestment 
from UC funding has led to tuition 
increases and cuts to staff, services and 
classes. 

“This is a multi-decade process of 
[California] pulling money from the 
University of California,” he said. “In 
the 2011-12 academic year, student 
fees accounted for a larger part of UC 
funding than state funding did.” 

If Prop. 30 is not passed by 
California voters on Nov. 6, a trigger 
cut of $250 million will automatically 
be made to both the UC and California 
State University systems. To close the 
budget gap that the cuts will leave, 
UC tuition would likely rise—which 
in turn would trigger a penalty cut of 
$125 million. The state government 
has pledged $125 million in funding 

for both the UC and CSU systems if 
they don’t raise tuition in 2012-13.

Stein said that if Prop. 30 fails, UC 
tuition will rise 20 percent beginning 
in January before subsequent increases 
in the following years. 

According to Stein, UC tuition will 
likely rise over the next three years 
regardless of Prop. 30’s fate. Stein esti-
mates that student tuition fees will rise 
around 5 percent for each of the next 
three years if 30 passes, and around 15 
percent if it fails. At that rate, tuition 
fees alone could reach $24,000 per year 
by 2015.

With the annual 5-percent increas-
es, tuition would hover around $15,000 
a year in 2015. Currently, tuition fees 
stand at $13,218. 

Stein said that the UC Regents were 
considering a number of other moves 
to limit the rapid rise of tuition and 
close growing budget gaps. Suggestions 

include restructuring the financial aid 
process, increasing out-of-state stu-
dent enrollment and creating more 
ways for students to earn credit and 
graduate faster.

“These are just Band-Aids on fatal 
wounds for the UC system,” he said at 
the presentation, which was held in the 
Student Services Center.

Stein also said he wanted to make 
clear that he was not advocating for 
Prop. 30’s passage as Student Regent, 
but was educating students on the 
consequences of its failure.

On Friday, a report issued by 
aroundthecapitol.com showed that 
Prop. 30 has 49.5 percent favorability 
with 8.8 percent of the electorate unde-
cided. That statistic is an average of 
several major polling agencies.

While California college students are racking up loans, it’s unsettling to know that another institution is swimming in funding: prisons. A non-partisan policy think tank, 
California Common Sense (CACS), released a report last Thursday, 
Oct. 4, called “Winners and Losers: Corrections and Higher Education 
in California.” The study exposes how the state has reduced higher 
education funding while simultaneously increasing funding for the 
state prison system since 1980. So at a time when students face a finan-
cial dilemma, the California prison system has been rapidly moving 
forward with rising budgets courtesy of powerful lobbies. The prison 
system, as a result, has been gulping the state budget, leaving sectors 
like education and public safety diluted, which calls the student body 
to vigorously engage in  prison reform — from salaries to private 
prison profits.

The gap between the education and prison sector illustrates a per-
centage increase over time. In fact, the trend began decades ago. For 
fiscal year 1980, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 
received $624 million from state; during the same year, the UC and 
CSU systems were granted $1.9 billion.  Fast forward to 2011: The UC 
and CSU systems received $5.9 billion from the state. The prisons, on 
the other hand, accounted for roughly $9.6 billion during 2011 — an 
amount that constitutes 40 percent more than the UC and CSU sys-
tems. The increase in funding for the prison system, along with gutting 
the education sector, seems counter-intuitive to what will fuel the soci-
ety of tomorrow.  According to an article published by the Huffington 

Post, since 1980, the UC system built one university (UC Merced) 
while the CDCR has built 21 prisons . It serves as a testament to the 
shift we have witnessed over time, as the prison industry has increased 
its funding to gruesome figures while the California university system 
funding dwindles. 

One of the major problems of the prison systems has been the 
prevalent forms of incarceration.  The United States, including 
California, incarcerates 25 percent of the world’s prison population 
despite having only 5 percent of the world population. California 
prisons, as a byproduct, have been bombarded with an overflow 
of prisoners. Current capacity houses 100,000 prisoners, but cur-
rently the prisons are saturated with 170,000 prisoners, which also 
has contributed to the problem. Experts have debated the rationale 
behind the high incarceration rates, but the prison dilemma can 
be stripped down to policy and laws that benefit the prison indus-
tries, and policies catering to the private prisons who have grown 
steadily over the last decade. 

As the budgets of prisons have escalated, so have the costs per 
inmate. The state of California contributes $8,667 per student per 
year, compared to almost $50,000 per year on a prisoner — mean-
ing the state pays 600 percent more for a prisoner than a student, 
according to a report on the CNN program, “GPS with Fareed 
Zakaria.” It is ming-boggling where this funding goes, when a 

Make Out 
Like a 
Bandit I

t’s only Week Two and I have 
already, despite my most adamant 
vows, fallen behind in nearly 

every class—because I keep telling 
myself it’s Week Two and I can easily 
catch up. Seasons may change, winter 
to spring, but I (and you and everyone 
else we know) will procrastinate to the 
end of time. 

I wish I could say that 
procrastination is a crucial 
mechanism we have been socialized 
to think is evil. Instead, I learned that 
procrastination is common, and a sign 
of foolish optimism about our future 
selves. 

In a 1999 study conducted 

by Read, Loewenstein and 
Kalyanaraman, researchers told people 
to pick three movies to watch either 
back-to-back, or spaced out over 
three days. When subjects thought 
they could space out the movies, 
they usually picked a lowbrow movie 
(say, “Speed”) to watch first, then a 
highbrow one like “Schindler’s List” 
(which they “should” be watching) 
for later. When they had to watch 
the three movies back-to-back, they 
just gave up. In these cases, highbrow 
movies like “Schindler’s List” were 13 
times less likely to be picked at all. 

In other words, we delude 
ourselves into thinking that we’ll have 
the willpower to finish that thesis 
later, so let’s play games now. We’re 
too optimistic, thinking that one week 
from now we will chose thesis-writing 
over video games, kale over Pringles, 
and “Schindler’s List” over “The Hot 
Chick”—so we procrastinate on things 
we “should” be doing at this moment. 
Yet one week from now, we will, 
statistically speaking, still be just as 
unmotivated. 

Another study, conducted in 2002 
by Wertenbroch and Ariely, is even 
more bleak. The researchers worked 
with three groups of students, who all 
needed to turn in three papers. Class 
A turned in all three papers on the last 
day. Class B had to pick (and stick to) 
their own deadlines. Class C turned in 
one paper each week. 

To the eternal sadness of everyone 
who claims the “I work better under 
pressure” defense, the students in C 
(forced to turn in a paper each week) 
had the best grades. Class B, who 
tended to space out their deadlines 
like Class C, did moderately well—
but there were always the overly 
optimistic slackers who choose 
end-of-quarter deadlines and whose 
last-minute papers, fueled by Red Bull 
and desperation, brought down the 
class average. Class A, with complete 
freedom, did the worst 
      There may be a weak light at 
the end of the tunnel. A 2005 study 
by Choi and Moran suggested that 
certain types of procrastinators 
actually did as well as non-
procrastinators. Good news, until I 
read further and realize that these 
high-achieving procrastinators are 
the people who “actively” decide 
to procrastinate—and not those,

Employers will continue to have 
the option of requiring applicants 
to already be employed, thanks to a 
bill vetoed on Sept. 30 by Gov. Jerry 
Brown. Michael Allen, the man 
behind the law, admitted to los-
ing faith after the bill was dragged 
through the legislative process and 
deprived of its original intentions. 
While the bill was intended to focus 
on creating fairness and equality 
during the application process, the 
end result concentrated too heavily 
on advertisements and was rightly 
vetoed. 

Brown saw several gaps in the 
potential law, one being the lack of 
specifics regarding pooling appli-
cants and what employers could and 
could not do during the application 
process. Proposing a bill that only 
addresses the line “unemployed 
need not apply” in employment ads 
while neglecting to address the line’s 
effects on the actual application pro-
cess is unfair to the applicant pool.

A weak proposal is not the 
solution. Applicants need to be 

protected from discrimination with 
a bill highlighting fairness in the 
employer and applicant system, 
not with misdirection focusing on 
the ads themselves. Additionally, 
many employers find value in seek-
ing applicants who are already 
employed. This screening process 
allows for people with a higher level 
of experience with useful skills to be 
spotlighted, regardless of their pre-
vious employment status.

By vetoing the bill, Brown is 
not dismissing the importance of 
addressing equality in the work-
force, but rather ensuring that deal-
ing with such a problem should 
require complete commitment 
from the lawmakers to concentrate 
on a solid solution. After being 
dismantled during the legislative 
process, the watered-down result 
was an inadequate bill that simply 
could not do what is was originally 
intended for.

Gov. Jerry Brown struck down a 
bill that would have made it illegal for 
California employers to discriminate 
against the unemployed during the 
hiring process. The bill should have 
been passed in light of the current job 
market, where qualified individuals 
are experiencing difficulty finding 
work. By discriminating against the 
unemployed, employers are missing 
the chance to work with potentially 
capable and competent employees and 
are limiting their companies’ competi-
tive edge by not allowing for a larger 
job pool.

 The bill would have made the 
practice of stating “unemployed need 
not apply” on job listings illegal. 
Although the bill doesn’t explicitly 
forbid employers from considering 
employment status during the inter-
view, it does exist to combat a growing 
stigma regarding the unemployed. 

In the December 2011 study 
“The Psychological Stigma of 
Unemployment: When Joblessness 
Leads to Being Jobless,” researchers 
at the UCLA Anderson School of 

Management found that the longer 
one is unemployed, the less likely one 
will be hired. The unemployed often 
find themselves in this state because 
of economic circumstances out of 
their control — unemployment does 
not necessarily mean that applicants 
are unskilled or lazy, as many employ-
ers would assume. A position should 
be filled based on the qualifications, 
skills and abilities the worker can 
bring to the company and not on 
extraneous factors.

Oregon and New Jersey are the 
only states thus far that have passed 
legislation prohibiting companies 
from such discriminatory action. 
California should have joined these 
two states in leading the nation in a 
much-needed step to ending discrimi-
nation against employment status. 

 Discrimination is wrong in all 
forms — the bill is necessary in creat-
ing a fair and competitive work force 
in California.

Dear editor, 
The new chancellor, Pradeep 

Khosla, who comes from Carnegie 
Mellon University, a private university 
in Pittsburgh, would like to see the 
university’s endowment grow from 
about $500 million to $3 billion to $5 
billion over the next 10 years. Other 
goals, he said, are to boost the per-
centage of graduate students enrolled 
at UC San Diego to 25 percent or 30 
percent, up from about 19 percent. 

According to the 2012-13 
Chronicle of Higher Education 
Almanac, federal R&D in FY 2010 
was $593,016,000 at UC San Diego.  
The graduation rate within 150 
percent of normal time at UC San 
Diego in 2010 was 86.1 percent.  The 
University of California system had 
$104,434,511 in Licensing Revenue, 
FY 2010.  Laptops are nearly ubiqui-
tous on campus.  UCLA had 6,249 
international students, 2010-11. The 
number of Chinese students has 
more than doubled at U.S. colleges, 
2005-09.  The number of Chinese 
students in 2010-11 was 157,558, with 
a sharp increase in the number of 
undergraduate students. The number 
of enrolled students at UC San Diego 
in Fall 2000 was 20,197; the number 
was 29,176 in Fall 2010 — a 44.5 
percent increase.  In 2008, California 
drew 10,202 students from out-of-
state, mostly from Washington, Texas 
and Oregon.  At all public four-year 
colleges from 2001-02 to 2011-12 
tuition and fees have risen 72 percent 
(on average). The rate of growth in 
tuition and fees far exceeded the rate 
of increase in faculty salaries over the 
past three decades. 

The average academic salary at 
UC Berkeley and UCLA combined 
was $158,300.

UC San Diego has a $3.4 billion 

budget, about $240 million of which 
comes directly from the state. If a bal-
lot measure that would temporarily 
boost taxes fails to win voter support 
in November, the UC system faces 
a $250-million cut in state funding. 
That could cost UC San Diego about 
$35 million. 

The market value of UC San 
Diego Foundation endowment as 
of June 30, 2011 was $378,506,156 
(an increase of 20.6 percent over 
the previous year).  The UC system 
has a $6,342,217,000 endowment, 
2011.  UC Berkeley Foundation has 
$1,054,800,000 endowment.  UCLA 
Foundation has a $1,486,244,000 
endowment. Two billion dollars is 
currently being spent on construction 
projects at UC San Diego alone.

Meanwhile, at Mira Mesa College 
in Oceanside, students were placed on 
waiting lists for 906 of 1,248 classes 
offered this fall.  In all, more than half 
of the colleges’ 14,545 students taking 
for-credit courses were on a waiting 
list for at least one class.  Systemwide, 
the number of class sections in 
public 2-year colleges in California 
decreased 24 percent from 2008-09 
to 2011.  UC Regent Dick Blum told 
me personally that Blum Investment 
Partners held $700,000,000 in for-
profit colleges because “community 
colleges aren’t doing their job; besides, 
that was before I married Dianne.”

student could live in an apartment 
in La Jolla, pay full tuition, live com-
fortably and still not exceed the cost 
of a prisoner. Even if a prisoner, with 
all due respect, may require additional 
treatment such as health and security, it 
does seem not justifiable to allow such 
monetary disparity given the impact 
students have — from taxes to social 
wisdom.

The average correctional officer, 
for example, makes around $73,000 
per year while a UC professor — with 
a doctorate degree — makes only 20 
percent more. This does not take into 
account entry-level instructors and 

associate professors that are already 
underpaid in comparison with a 
prison guard in California.

Critics may argue that prison 
employees face difficult tasks, such as 
long hours and a rough environment, 
but the facts say otherwise. According 
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
Californian security jobs make twice 
the amount as other security guards 
in states like Arizona or Florida. 
Differences between salary pay can be 
contributed to the nation’s two largest 
private prison company, Corrections 
Corporations of America (CCA) and 
the Geo Group, who have combined 
lobbied  $19.8 million during the last 
10 years, according to the Center for 

Responsive Politics. The most startling 
component has been the proliferation 
of the private prison industry in the 
last two decades, along with the very 
influential prison lobbies who have 
shaped current policy.

Education has always led the way 
to economic and social prosperity. 
Even in difficult economic times, the 
college pathway provides the best 
opportunity for social and economic 
mobility. As students part of a sys-
tem in peril, this is a call to action 
that we vigorously express our views 
and facts, because the status quo of 
diminishing budgets while other 
agency budgets increase is simply 
unacceptable.

California Prison Guard Salaries Are Too Inflated

If you listened hard enough this month, you could hear all of the UC system’s 96,000 middle-class 
students groaning as the California 
Senate voted down the Middle Class 
Scholarship Act (AB 1500), a measure 
that would have cut fees for students 
whose families make between $50,000 
and $150,000 by up to two-thirds. 
Tuition has been rising for everyone 
attending a UC school, but by most 

accounts, it’s the middle class that’s 
been hit the hardest.

They had it good back in the day. 
Historically, financial aid has been cal-
culated at UC schools with the intent 
of “normalizing debt.” This means that 
aid is given out so that, roughly speak-
ing, every student graduates with the 
same amount of debt. Middle-class 
families pay a bit more, lower-income 
families pay a bit less. 

Throughout the ‘70s and most of 
the ‘80s, normalizing debt worked very 
well. According to statistics compiled 
by the Rodda Project, UC students 
graduated with a debt between $3,000 
and $6,000, depending on the cam-
pus and year. Middle-class students, 
defined by the study as those whose 
families made between $50,000 and 
$150,000 per year, graduated with 
roughly the same amount of debt as 
students from low-income families. 
For years, the difference in mean debt 
level did not exceed a few hundred 
dollars. 

The Rodda Project found that in 
the early ‘70s, the UC system was 
subsidized heavily by the California 
state government — 60 percent of the 
annual budget was covered by state 
funding in those years. However, this 
number declined steadily throughout 
the ‘80s and again during the 2000s. 

Of course, things have changed. 
Today, tuition at any given campus 
costs nearly $14,000 — largely because 
the government has slashed funding 
year after year, providing just 10.1 
percent of the cost of running the 
university.

Now here’s the interesting part: 
state tuition subsidies are flexible, 
but need-based financial aid is not. 
Middle-class students were the chief 
beneficiaries of the state tuition subsi-
dies that kept fees down in the past, but 
which have been cut every year by the 
California legislature: It’s simply a mat-
ter of tweaking the annual budget. In 
fact, in recent years, the state’s tuition 
subsidy has frequently been the first 
thing cut. Need-based financial aid, on 
the other hand, is much harder to cut. 
Statutes like the Higher Education Act 
of 1965, under which the Pell Grants 
were initiated, require full-congressio-
nal approval to modify. Cuts to these 
statutes are unpopular, difficult and 
regularly discussed, but rarely done.

For these reasons, the failure of 
AB 1500 has led us to a peculiar par-
adox: It’s now less affordable for a 
middle-class student to attend a UC 
school than it is for a student whose 
family makes below $50,000 per year.

Class 
Financial 
Paradox

On Campus: Close to Home

Hidden in 
Plain Sight

UC San Diego has just earned an unusual accolade — it’s the only school in the UC system that guarantees four years of on-
campus housing. 

Maybe it’s the strict “quiet hours,” and  the 
party-busting RSO’s. Or maybe it’s the inconve-
nient, mandatory meal plans and the high on-
campus housing rates they come with. Whatever 
the cause, students at other UC campuses flock to 
nearby off-campus communities as soon as they 
can. Tritons, however, seem comfortable enough 
calling campus their home.

While students at Santa Barbara have a thriv-
ing off-campus college community, Isla Vista, to 
house them after a year or two on campus, La 
Jolla has no such equivalent; UCSD students tend 
to scatter across neighborhoods like Hillcrest, 
Pacific Beach and Clairemont Mesa. A universal 
“top choice” for UCSD students doesn’t exist.

Students have cited cold relations between the 
traditionally affluent La Jollan community and 
the campus as reason for a lack of a viable, central 
off-campus community. 

Peggy Chodorow, who co-founded Team 
Chodorow of San Diego, one of the most domi-
nant forces in the La Jolla Real Estate Market, 
explained that this is not necessarily the case.

 “Having the university here has brought a 
better equilibrium to La Jolla. People like that 
there are young people coming to the area and 
invigorating the town,” Chodorow said. “I haven’t 
heard of any negativity from residents. They get 
to interact and take part in UCSD activities, and 
enjoy the students being here.”

Instead, La Jolla’s lack of opportunities for a 
college social scene can be attributed to its price 
tag. In downtown San Diego, $1,500 per month 
will get you a high-end two-bedroom apartment. 
In La Jolla, the same amount might get you a 
one-bedroom, at most. Most students split one-
bedroom apartments, which average at roughly 
$7,500 per year.  The cost of living in a single 
room in an on-campus apartment is $10,966 
for the 2012-13 academic year. It costs roughly

Until very recently, scientists had 
believed only 15 of Leonardo da Vinci’s 
paintings still survived. It has taken 
him 11 years, but UCSD bioengineer 
Maurizio Seracini has proven them 
wrong. 

“Finding the Lost da Vinci” is a 
National Geographic documentary 
that chronicles Seracini’s decade-long 
effort to find the lost painting. The first 
public screening was held this Monday, 
Oct. 12 at the Great Hall in Eleanor 
Roosevelt College.

The documentary has been in the 
works since this March, when Seracini 
and a team of graduate students at 
the Jacobs School of Engineering 
announced that “The Battle of 
Anghiari,” one of da Vinci’s most fabled 
creations, had been found intact but 
obscured. The team used several his-

torical documents to track the painting 
down to a hidden compartment in the 
Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, 
the city hall of Florence. It has been 
valued at over $100 million, accord-
ing to Falco Kuester, a UCSD software 

engineer who worked with Seracini. 
“As a piece that used a completely 

new style of painting, it’s a priceless 
masterpiece,” Kuester said at the on-
campus premiere of the documentary.

The problem? It has been trapped 

for centuries behind an equally price-
less masterpiece —Giorgio Vasari’s 
fresco, “The Battle of Marciano”. Before 
uncovering “The Battle of Anghiari,”

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 15,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

$3,500 more to live on campus for a 
year at UCSD. 

To compare this with a university 
that has a thriving off-campus cul-
ture, it costs $13,275 per year to live 
on campus at UC Santa Barbara, and 
just $6,000 to live off campus at the 
student-dominated Isla Vista apart-
ment community nearby. 

The $7,275 differential makes it 
logical for UC Santa Barbara students 
to move off campus, giving no prac-
tical reason for a four-year housing 
guarantee. Also, the affordability of Isla 
Vista has allowed students to establish 
a strong, close-knit community. 

But things are different for UCSD 
students who want to live off campus 
due to La Jolla’s high cost of living 
and notoriously absent community. 
Thus, for many students, choosing 

to prolong their stay on campus is a 
reasonable decision, and the newly 
announced four-year housing guaran-
tee caters exactly to this point.

“[UC] Santa Barbara is in a com-
mercial area, while UCSD is not. 
Students have to go to downtown to 
get that commercial feel,” Chodorow 
said.

For junior Revelle College student 
Alexander Taylor, who lives in the 
Sixth College apartments, the commu-
nity that on-campus living provides, 
which the La Jolla community lacks, 
justifies the higher cost of housing.

“[The expense differential] isn’t a 
big deal for me,” Taylor said. “I just 
like the community living on campus, 
not having to take a bus. I don’t regret 
it at all.”

Middle-Class 
Scholarships

Nov. 2010 by the UC Newsroom, the 
average graduating debt for 2009–10 
was $12,787 for low-income students 
and $15,806 for middle-income stu-
dents.

It’s a uniquely weird situation. In 
the United Kingdom, tuition is capped 
at $11,543 for all students at all colleg-
es, thanks to a heavy government sub-
sidy. Loans are available, but students 
whose families make more, graduate 
with less debt. 

In China and India, subsidies are 
even heavier: Tsinghua University, 
China’s best, charges just $4,773 per 
year for the students that get in. At 
IIT Gharakpur, India’s highest-ranked 
college, tuition is even less — $3,912 
per year. As in the UK, government 
subsidies were never intended to nor-
malize debt, as they once did in the UC 
system. In difficult economic times, 
poorer students graduate with great-
er debt because they are able to pay 
less. The concept of financial aid that 
is based on need, rather than merit, 
is non-existent in these countries. In 
China, for instance, government schol-
arships are only given to the top scor-
ers on the gaokao, the national college 
entrance exam.

In these other countries, funding 
is simplified because it comes solely 
from the state. In a budget cut, tuition 
increases for everybody — as it briefly 
did at Tsinghua in the 1990s. For the 
UC’s, in contrast, funding comes from 
a patchwork of grants and subsidies, 
each intended for a different kind of 
student and each with a set of protec-
tions and clauses that differs from the 
others. The result is that changes in 
California state funding affect some 
UC students more than others — a 
phenomenon unique among the great 
public universities of the world.

his current project, Seracini worked 
as an art diagnostician, using scientific 
and historical data to determine the 
authenticity of paintings and sculp-
tures.

As a part of this work, he read 
Vasari’s diaries, which remain more or 
less intact in the Florentine Archives. 
Vasari, who was born 59 years after 
da Vinci, considered himself to be da 
Vinci’s greatest admirer. The diaries 
contained several passages that praised 
da Vinci’s paintings, as well as sug-
gestions that one of them — “The 
Battle of Anghiari” — would have to be 
obscured by a fresco.

Seracini was part of a team doing 

restoration work in 2000 on “The 
Battle of Marciano” when he noticed 
a small green flag on the left-hand 
corner of the painting, carried by a 
squadron of soldiers that faced a dif-
ferent direction from the rest. It read: 
“Cerca Trovare” — Italian for “He who 
seeks, finds.”

“That’s our evidence, and it’s not 
airtight, but it’s all we’ve got right now,” 
Seracini says at the start of the film.

The researchers predicted that 
“The Battle of Anghiari” lay behind the 
Vasari. To prove their hypothesis, they 
created a set of tools for their analysis.  

“We developed technology specifi-
cally for this project, which had never 
been used before.”

One of these technologies was 

energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, 
generally used to identify smaller mol-
ecules. The research team adapted it 
so that the larger molecules present in 
lacquer and paint could be more read-
ily identified using only the few grams 
of paint flakes the team had access to.  

It paid off: The analysis revealed 
that the material was chemically simi-
lar than the brown glaze in da Vinci’s 
“Mona Lisa” and “St. John the Baptist,” 
which were painted around the same 
time as “The Battle of Anghiari.” 

They also found microscopic flakes 
of beige paint that contained the tell-
tale patterns of a fine-haired brush, 
suggesting that a painting lay behind 
the layer of glaze. 

“Finding the Lost da Vinci” exam-

ines in vivid detail the many obstacles 
that stand between a historical search 
team and buried art. There’s the garru-
lous Italian media, convinced that the 
UCSD researchers are out to destroy 
the Vasari. There are the lethargic gov-
ernment agents, who nearly buried 
the team’s dreams beneath years of red 
tape and paperwork. And there is the 
Vasari itself, which threatens to chip 
and crack with every delicate incision 
the scientists make.

“The project seemed impossible at 
many times along the way,” Kuester 
said. “But against all odds, the team 
persevered.”

assists and three solo blocks. 
UCSD played well in their first set, 

besting CSU San Bernardino 25-18, 
but lacked consistency down the 
stretch. The Tritons 
took the second set 
25-21, with a 47 attack 
percentage, but fell in 
the third. 

The Tritons took 
the fourth set with a 
score of 25-21. 

In the fifth and 
final set, UCSD tallied 
a notable six attack 
errors, costing the 
Tritons the fifth set.

At home Friday 
and Saturday night, 
UCSD made fast 
work of bottom-of-
the-conference CSU 
Monterey Bay (4-7) 
and CSU East Bay (3-8).

CSU Monterey Bay is led by the 
second best kills per set athlete in the 
CCAA Julia Ashen. 

Ashen, who averages 3.98 
individual kills per set — just above 
UCSD’s Dahle with 3.75.

In a good showing of team 
defense, the Tritons held Ashen to 
just nine kills.

With the Otters’ best athlete 

shut down, UCSD glided past CSU 
Monterey Bay. UCSD totaled 52 kills 
in its three-set victory. Against CSU 
Monterey Bay, UCSD was able to 
utilize talent from around the roster. 

Freshman middle blocker 
Kameron Cooper tallied 
five kills and two blocking 
assists, sophomore 
Rachelle Kinney also 
had five kills with three 
assists. 

Dahle led in kills with 
16. 

Hawthorne had 
another great game with 
36 assists and no errors. 

UCSD showed signs 
of weakness in their first 
set coming off the loss 
to CSU San Bernardino, 
only taking the win 
with a slight three-point 
margin. 

However, into the 
second set, the Tritons showed new 
life, logging 21 kills in their 25-13 
second set victory. 

The Tritons carried the 
momentum into the final set where 
UCSD had a 75 attack percentage, to 
take the 25-12 victory. 

The win improved UCSD to 7-3 
in CCAA, going into their game 
against CSU East Bay.

On Saturday, CSU East Bay (2-9), 

flat-out outplayed UCSD in the 
first set, as the Tritons recorded an 
abysmal 60 attack percentage.

After an embarrassing first set 
loss, UCSD came back with a more 
solid performance in the second with 
a 25-17 set win, where Tritons totaled 
14 kills and a 76 attack percentage. 

Carrying into the third, UCSD 
topped East Bay 25-13, and then 
again in the fourth set 25-15.

The win improves UCSD to 
8-3 in conference play, moving the 
Tritons into a tie for second place 
with San Francisco State, while San 
Bernardino remains in first.

UCSD has now competed against 
every team in the CCAA. 

“The league is so close right now 
with so many teams,” Dahle said 
to the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“We’re going to have to win all 
our next games before [CSU San 
Bernardino] to hopefully get a tie 
there.”

Next Friday, Oct. 19, UCSD 
will face 7-4 CSU Los Angeles on 
the road, a team that gave UCSD 
a startling first loss in the Tritons’ 
home opener. 

After their game with the 
Golden Eagles, UCSD takes on CSU 
Dominguez Hills (7-4).

the mosaic of Bay Area stereotypes, 
people from different areas of the 
Bay don’t often associate with each 
other. While living in Fremont, I 
never expected to befriend people 
from supposedly snobby Marin; 
I’m sure that they never expected 
to chat comfortably with someone 

from chronically nerdy Fremont. 
But with the Giants’ recent success, 
we all have something in common 
to bond over. Bandwagoning has 
turned the Bay Area into a cohesive 
body, even including fans of the 
Oakland A’s, whose run down the 
stretch was a pleasant surprise to 
many. The tangible unity among Bay 
Area residents has vastly improved 

my enjoyment of Giants baseball.
The Chicago Cubs will always 

have my heart. Next year will be 
their year (the motto of every war-
worn Cubs fan since 1908). But 
in the meantime, I don’t see the 
problem with donning a Giants cap 
and cheering them on to victory. I 
guess I’m a bandwagoner, and there’s 
nothing wrong with that.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 15,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

My Facebook newsfeed is a flood of orange and black.Since the San Francisco 
Giants made the MLB playoffs, 

90 percent of the status updates, 
uploaded photos and article links 
from my hometown buddies have 
been about the Bay Area baseball 
team. Now that our boys have 
advanced to the NLDS, there are 
going to be even more.

Around 75 percent of these 
Giants-obsessed Facebook friends 
are what we call “bandwagoners” — 
eager, vocal fans who start paying 
attention to their team of choice only 
when that team advances into post-
season play. These are the folks who 
scoop up the last of the jerseys from 
the official team store, buy tickets 
to games from scalpers in stadium 
parking lots and think that RBI 
stands for “Really Big Improvement”.

The other 25 percent are 
veteran fans grumbling about the 
bandwagoners.

Although I understand the 
resentment from people who have 
stood by their team through thick 
and thin, I don’t think bandwagoning 
is as big an issue as die-hard devotees 
would want you to believe. In fact, 
I’m a bandwagoner myself. And I 
think that those enthusiastic fans 
jumping into the Giants parade are 
helpful to both the team and other 
fans alike.

For one, there’s all the money that 
the bandwagoners are pulling in. 

 “The Giants’ first World Series 
title in San Francisco led to record 
revenue ($230 million) as more than 
3 million fans turned out at AT&T 
Park and the team sold more than 
$600,000 worth of merchandise at 
its store in just the first 36 hours 
after winning the National League 
pennant,” according to Forbes.com.

In other words, people who hadn’t 
previously attended Giants games 
or owned Giants merchandise — 
bandwagoners — turned out in huge 
numbers, flooding the Giants’ bank 
account with dinero. Despite the 
moans of those old-timers who’ve 
been holding onto the same baseball 
cap since the team first came to San 
Francisco, it’s the dollars and interest 
of the newbies that are helping the 
team break revenue records.

It’s also hard to ignore the sense 
of solidarity that comes with the 
team popularity that bandwagoning 
brings about. A few days ago, I was 
outside Warren Lecture Hall waiting 
for class, persistently early due to 
my crippling paranoia about being 
even a minute late to anything. Too 
lazy to tackle the tangle of curls my 
hair had spitefully twisted into the 
night before, I pulled my Giants cap 
down over my ears in a vain attempt 
to hide the frizzy mass on top of 
my head. I struck up a conversation 
about memories of AT&T Park with 
a couple of girls from the Bay — 
Marin, to be exact.

After going 2-2 at the SoCal 
Tournament back in September, the 
No. 11 UCSD Men’s Water Polo 
team fell to No. 10 CSU Long Beach 
last Friday, Oct. 12 at Canyonview 
pool.

The Tritons took an early lead 
against the Lancers, going into the 
half up 4-3. 

In the third quarter, both teams 
recorded four points apiece, with 
the Tritons maintaining a slight 8-7 
advantage.

“For three quarters, we were 
executing the game plan to a 
tee,” UCSD Head Coach Denny 
Harper said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department.

With one quarter remaining, the 
Tritons fell apart, as the Lancers 
were able to find the holes in the 
UCSD defense.

Triton goalkeeper sophomore 

Cameron Ravanbach tallied a 
career-high 15 saves, but was unable 
to fend off the Long Beach drive to 
goal. The Lancers scored four goals 
in the closing quarter, while UCSD 
was unable to respond.

“I thought Cameron absolutely 
stepped up,” Harper said. “When 
you get any goalie making 15-plus 
saves a game, it’s pretty fantastic.”

Junior utility Luke Syka — 
UCSD’s second top goal scorer 
— led the Tritons with four goals, 

filling in the gap left by junior driver 
Josh Stiling. Stiling leads all Tritons 
with 49 goals in just 13 games.

Senior utility Brian Donohoe 
finished with two goals, while 
two-meter sophomore Joe Dietrich 
and senior utility John Butler both 
contributed one goal apiece. 

The Tritons keep their heads 
above .500, as the loss dropped them 
to 7-6 overall and 6-2 in the Western 
Water Polo Association.

It’s yet to be decided whether the 

loss will sink UCSD further down 
the national rankings, before the 
Tritons face WWPA opponent Air 
Force on Thursday, Oct. 18. 

The last time UCSD went up 
against Air Force was back on 
Saturday, Sept. 15 in the Norcal 
Tournament hosted by Stanford. 

The Tritons forced double-
overtime to take the 8-7 win.

Tritons Fall to CSU Long Beach 11-8

By Nash howe
Associate Sports Editor

With three conference matchups against first-ranked CSU San Bernardino, CSU Monterey Bay 
and CSU East Bay, UCSD Volleyball has 
found themselves tied for second halfway 
through the regular season.

The Tritons’ first game last Wednesday, 
Oct. 10, was arguably UCSD’s most significant 
loss of the season so far.

Traveling north to San Bernardino to 
face the Coyotes (7-1), UCSD tallied a total 
of 30 attack errors in its 3-2 loss to CSU San 
Bernardino.

“We squandered a lot of opportunities 

to score on defense,” UCSD Head Coach 
Ricci Luyties said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We had a lot of chances, but 
not enough swing for points.”

Offensively, the Triton attack was led by 
their underclassmen. 

Freshman Danielle Dahle totaled 19 kills 
and sophomore standout Sara McCutchan 
finished with 21. 

Hawthorne set the pace for UCSD with 52 
assists on the night.

On the defensive end, the Tritons totaled 
80 total digs. 

McCutchan — the third-best blocker in 
the CCAA — contributed seven blocking
