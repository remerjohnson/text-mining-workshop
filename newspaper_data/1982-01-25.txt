The battle over UCSD's 
backyard - what to do 
with the La Jolla Farms 

BY MICHAELAHN 
Staff Writer 

I f you get on North Torrey Road and head north toward the Salk Institute. past Muir 
College, you will see off to your left 
a tract of land known as La Jolla 
Farms. 
. Not much stands on it now, there is only 

an empty barn, a boarded-up table and 
some poles which horses used to jump 
over. Everything is weedy and quiet. 

Yet this is the place over which a battle 
is being fought. It is a battle that involves 
all sorts of people: millionaires and 
housewives, student and teachers. It i a 
battle of "good guys" and "bad guys." 

Sickel O'Brien, a San Diego developer. 
is planning to build 36 townhome ,seven 
estate homes, a re earch and developmen t 
center, and two conference centers along 
with several thousand quare feet of 
commercial space on this 24 acre parcel of 
UCSD property. And , with thi planned 
development has come a wave of prote t 
from the re idents who would live near 
the proposed project. 

"When you work all your life to make 
some money for yourself and buy a house 
and then have somelxxly come along and 
change everything - of course you're 
going to fight them ... , said Patricia Has e , 
whose husband, Robert, heads the La Jolla 
Farms Homeowner's A ociation. the 
large t group to oppose this plan. 

"We're trying to get people to think," 
said Mrs. Ha e, "We want them to know 
what kind of slick advertising Sickel 
O'Brien i trying to pulL" 

The La Jolla Farm Homeowner' 
A sociation is quite unhappy with the 
prospect of a commercial development and 
a wet lab being erected acros the treet 
from their home . But. ince CSD own 
the land, they can only advise UCSD a to 
how the land should be used . They st ill 
have a chance to change Chancellor 
Atkinson's mind before he makes a final 
decision on the plan thi Wedne day. 

"We're going to fight this thing all the 
way to the end, and we're going to win. " 
said Mrs. Hasse. 

In the minds of O'Brien and Brad Neal, 
the architect of the project , there i no 
dou bt that Blackhorse Farms (the name of 
the propo ed development) will be u eful 
to the community. In fact , both O'Brien 
and Neal are absolutely convinced that the 
proposal will u e the land to it maximum 
potential. 

"Blackhor e Farms i a sen itive blend 
of use that i compatible to the unlver itr. 
and the urrounding community as well. ' 
said Mr. Neal. 

"It all depend on your perception of the 
land . I it part of La Jolla or is it part of the 
Univer ity which owns it? We feel it is 
part of UC D. Of cour e no plan i perfect . 
no plan can satisfy every IxxI y. But this 
new science research center will bring the 
be t mind of the country to an Diego." 

Neal, along with Mr. O'Brien. ha been 
under a lot of stres lately. They have 
presented their plan to the public five 
times and each time have faced a barrage 

of accusations from angry homeowners. 
Among the ensitive points are: The 
buffer zone between the complex and the 
home and whether or not this buffer of 
vegetat ion will be adequate. Also in the 
minds of some homeowners is the 
question of using the land for commercial 
purpo es. ome feel that when William 
Black, the original owner, sold the 
property to the school in 1967 he meant for 
it to be u ed for purely educational 
purpo es. Since Black i now decea ed, 
this can only be speculatIOn. 

To the UCSD admini tration, the La 
Jolla Farms means money. 

If you look at the old stable and all the 
empty, barren land you are looking at 
dollar and cents, lot of them By rea on 
of it exi ·tence in a place next to a 
univer ity and next to lav!. h, expensive 
homes, all 24 acre is worth $33 million. 

But the Farms also mean money to the 
neighnoring re idents: If a complex I 
built on the Farms the value of the 
neighboring property will not contmue to 
ri e. 

And 0 the unlver. ity administration i 
faced with difficult choice: either build 
nothing on the property and gam nothing 
or build on the property and sacrifice the 
value of the neighboring property. 

La Jolla Farm belong. to UC D. It used 
to belong to a man named Bill Black, who 
u ed to own most of t he property 
bordering Torrey Pme Road . The famous 
(or infamou ) Black's Beach wa named 
after him. 

William Black bought the land shortly 
after WWII, and he built a home for hi 
family there. Thi home later arne the 
Chancellor's hou e. Bill Bla k decided to 
make hi property a cattle ranch where. it 
wa hoped, he could rai e 'ome prize 
Hereford. Thi wa not to be, and he gave 
up on the idea. Early in 1950 Mr. Black 
made his property into a racehor e 
breeding stable where. it was hoped. he 
could rai e some champion thorough-
bred . This was also not to be. He got rid of 
the thoroughbred but kept the table. 
He felt that he could develop the property 
a re Idential lot . The added attraction 
wa that if people bought a home on hi 
property they could rai e hor e at the 
tables clo e by. It wa known a a "Beach 

and Bridle club." Thi idea eemed to 
work. 

By 1965 La Jolla Farm had become a 
pre'tigiou re Idential I~~:ghborhood 
Augte Handley wa the trainer at the 

table -. and he kept over a hundred 
horse. on that lot. In 1965 Augte Handley 
sold hi stabl to a d tor living near La 
lolla Farm . After Mr. Handle) left the 
stables became more exclu Ive. cutting 
down the number of student to fifty and 
rai ing the price of hor es from $500-
$5000 to a minimum of $5 up to 
$25.000. From then on the table traded 
hand up until la t year. when the la t 
trainer wa evicted for not paying rent on 
time.

Opinion 
That was Josh 

It was one of the most well-organized and merciless 
advertising campaigns on the UCSD campus in many 
years. From the posters on Urey Hall to the leaflets 
distributed all over campus to the words on classroom 
blackboards throughout the quarter, JOSH was a 
mysterious phenomenon never quite explained. 

Oliphant 

Pacific News Service 

Monday. January 25, 1982 

Last week, the mystery became a reality, Josh 
McDowell, a lecturer on Christianity, appeared in the 
Revelle cafeteria on Wednesday and Thursday. 
McDowell, 42, tours the country speaking on college 
campuses on topics dealing with sex, scientific 
va1idity of Christianity, the historical accuracy of the 
Bible, etc. He is employed by Campus Crusade for 
Christ. UCSD's local chapter of the group brought 
McDowell to the campus. 

An Iranian in LA 
Approximately 350 people attended McDowell's 

lecture on historical proof for the Resurrection. 
McDowell's second lecture, entitled "Maximum 
Sex," attracted over 500 people. _ 

The media blitz style of the Josh advertising 
campaign was greatly aided by a $1500 programming 
budget allocation for the event by the AS Council. 
Critics have charged that such an allocation for a 
religious speaker is a violation of the doctrine of 
separation between church and state. 

Such a charge dies quickly of irrationality. First of 
all, speakers of many religious persuasions have been 
brought to the campus at AS expense. The point of 
having such speakers on a college campus seems 
clear. The promotion of differing views of the world, 
religious or non-religious is certainly within the 
normal intellectual activity of a campus. 

Josh McDowell, furthermore, was not the 
stereotypical, dogmatic, fundamentalist , consevative 
fanatic Christian that we can all envision. His 
lectures were informative, interesting, funny and 
enjoyable. But most importantly, they were not a 
blatant attempt to condemn or convert the audience. 
His lecture on sex, especially, discussed the subject in 
an enlightened and rational manner. Discussions of 
morals , taboo, and religion were deemphasized as the 
speaker tried to show how having emotional 
involvement with one's partner prior to engaging in 
sexual activity will enhance such activity. Josh was 
not another Brother Jed. He spoke to a college 
audience, a mixture of religious and non-religious 
people, and it is obvious he knew his audience. 

Yes, Josh was a religious speaker. But the speeches 
he made were of a very realistic character, and we 
should hope that the AS will continue to fund 
lectures, on su bjects of all different types, that have 
the quality of the Josh McDowell lectures. 

Letter to the Editor 

BY BEHROUZ SABA 
Pacific News Service 

My 16t h year in this country 
opened wit h 1982, and the 
c ircum s tan ces of recent 
history provide me with an 
especiall y difficult identity: I 
am an (ranian , living in 
America. 

Many of my habits are 
undeniably American. [ can't 
tart the morning without 

st rong coffee, the latest 
installment of Peanuts and a 
breakfast that "sticks to my 
ribs." As a free·lance writer, I 
keep regular hours at my 
typewriter in a conscientious 
concession to the work ethic. 
I'm disappointed when the 
mail brings frequent. politely 
worded rejection slips from 
publishers, yet don tallow 
myself to wallow in despair for 
too long. I regard myself most 
American in that I consider no 
goal unattainable with enough 
persistent and hard work . 

I'm a demon when it comes 
to sniffing out sales at the 
supermarket , keep a walletful 
of credit cards, and go to bed 
grumpy when Johnny Carson 
temporaril y abdicates his 
throne to a guest host. 

With my name and accent, 
however, I can look forward to 
an all too predictable question 
- "Where're you from?" -
whenever I meet someone 
new. Often I volunteer a 
thumbnail biograph y: I came 
to thi s country nearly 16 years 
ago to get a co\1ege education , 
and have decided to stay on 
because my expertise as a 
Ph.D. in American film hi story 
and crit ici m doesn't seem to 

be in particularly high demand 
in revolutionarr Iran . 

(know that I m in a country 
in which openness is a part of 
the national ethos, and evasion 
in itself can be the greatest 
cause of suspicion . 

I speak English fluently, 
keep up with news from a 
variety of sources, and often 
check against my Middle 
Eastern tendencies to be 
demonstrative or strong in 
stating my ideas. Yet I know 
that others expect me to 
examine various issues from 
perspectives that I am afforded 
by my now controversial 
background . Year s of 
sometimes painful adjustment 
have taught me that the secret 
of social survival here is to 
walk a tightrope between 
eccentricity and conformity. 
For America it elf is at once a 
homogeneous "mel ting pot" of 
many national , racial and 
ethnic groups, as well as a 
highly pluralistic society in 
which various lifes tyles and 
ideologies flouri sh. 

My arrival in America 
coincided with a time of great 
soc ial flux and ten sion . 
Mi\1ions of Americans my age 
- "the baby boom generation" 
- were flocking to colleges 
and uni versities, hungry for 
new idea and experiences. 
The war in Vietnam was 
compe\1ing many of them to re-
examine their country's 
political and moral posture in 
the world . As a result of the 
civil right s movement , not 
only blacks, but an even larger 
number of Americans al so 
were becoming interested in 

their ethnic and racial root s. 
Having just left behind the 

restrictive political and family 
atmosphere in Iran for the 
California coast, I was not only 
intrigued by the variety of new 
ideas, but dazzled by the era's 
unconventional mu sic, 
fashions and art. Perhaps too 
conveniently, I forgot about 
the role that America then 
played in my own country, and 
set out to become involved 
wholeheartedly in th e 
American controvers ies of the 
time. 

In those days of plentiful oil , 
with the shah an unquestion· 
ing American a\1y , Iran hardly 
was a household name in 
California . The obscurity of 
my national origin then 
allowed me to enjoy a certain 
anonymity, while I studied 
this country's society and 
culture with what gradua\1y 
became an ob essive preoc· 
cupation . I wanted to be a 
writer, a nd was fa s t 
discovering that I could not 
achieve my goal by remaining 
an outsiderforever . To be fully 
understood by my teacher , 
and eventually by my readers, 
I not only had to read and write 
in English, but also to sharein 
the hopes, fears and dreams of 
American. 

I wasn 't quite aware of it at 
the time, but I was slowly 
10 ing ight of my original 
mandate to acquire American 
know-how. and then return to 
serve the people of my own 
country. Instead I was taking 
part in that venerable drama 
of individualism and assimila·

Reagan's election: a Commie plot? 
Editor: 

Where' Joseph McCarthy 
when you need him? Those 
cunning, conniving commu· 
ni ts have really done it this 
time. They've got one of their 
gu ys in the White House! 
Everyone knew they were up 
to something das tardly, but 
this warrants that dras tic 
measures be taken. 

The dirty guys went out and 
found the most red·blooded·all-
superbowl -Ameri can couple 
they could find , exploited their 
properties through many 
media, and a soon as John Q. 
Public was convinced of this 
couple 's apple'pieness, the duo 
r.Qde their white horse right 

into our bel 'wed nation's 
capital! 

Initiall y, tho e who 
questioned the motives of this 
perilous pair were asking' 'wi\1 
this cowboy lead us into a 
s hoot 'em up with the 
Ruskies?" It turns out to be a 
quest ion o f s uperficial 
significance. Only now, after 
almost a year of Reagan 
Idolatry, is the plot starting to 
show through - a sweeping, 
passive takeover by the Reds. 

Consider two blatantly , 
almost laughably , cuddley , 
century·old Americans. Who 
cou ld question the motives of 
such innocent looking shit· 
kickers? Who could pos ibly 

doubt the intentions of Nancy, 
who wears her clothes solely to 
promote the American fas hion 
indu try, and Ronnie, good oJ' 
Ronnie, who co- tarred with a 
chimpanzee on television? Yet 
the two are engaged in the 
conver ion of a country -
from a democratic society to an 
evil communist state. 

Reagan 's role in this crime-
against·humanity is becoming 
increasingly more apparent as 
the plot unfolds. His is ajobof 
both cover-up and execution. 
He was recently quoted a 
warning that Americans who 
doubted hi intentions of a 
mas ive military build·up "are 

doing a disservice to the 
country." Aye, but just who's 
country was he referring to' 
The huge military build-up is a 
terrible menace to our 
country. How could we be 
disserved by it ' demolition? 
Reagan ' action are vile not 
as an impetus for an all·out 
nuclear war, no the Ruskie 's 
wouldn't like that. 

It is not the military which 
is the real threat, but the build-
up. Reagan is shoveling a\1 of 
this nation 's tax revenues into 
a hungry, ever-expanding, 
wasteful furnace leaving all 
truly needed sevices naked in 
the freezing streets. When 

services become extinct , when 
economic di sas ter ensues, 
when Fido is on the dinner 
table, and Ma i waiting in a 

, mile long line to buy bread, 
that's when the Soviets move 
in. They come not to slaughter 
us with atom bombs, but to 
feed us , to helter us, and to 
give us new pets. We fo\1ow 
them, blinded by hunger and 
resentment, into a new world· 
communist·state. 

Wake-up America! Open 
your eyes and ee the red 
around you. Let's make thi 
country great again ...

orne extent style triumphed 
over ubstance, and rhetoric 
over effective action . 

Still , what has kept me 
fascinated with thi s nation all 
a long has been it talent for 
t he continuing debate over and 
exchange of ideas - for 
learning from past mistakes 
and looking to the future with 
hope. In Iran, a preponderance 
of religiou and cultural 
tradition , and a highl y 
patriarchal social sys tem, 
have not allowed for a similar 
course of evolution . This 
inherent cultural difference 
clouds the two nation s' 
perceptions of one another in 
no small measure. 

Yet today, with political and 
economic Int erdependence 
among nations ever increas· 
ing there is a new challenge for 
Americans in taking a more 
acti ve interest in world affairs 
and th e role that their country 
plays in the international 
arena . More important than 
money, arms and technology , 
they can hare with the world 
their gift for openness, debate

The political cost of Nancy's wardrobe 
Fred Fielding , former 

ass i tant to Nixon Whit e 
House counsel John Dean , has 
a problem. 

Fielding is Ronald and 
Nancy Reagan 's White Hou 'e 
lawyer. Under a requirement 
of the 1978 Ethi cs in 
Government Act, the Reagan 
will soon have to make a public 
di 'closure of tho e gift worth 
more than $35 which they 
received in 1981 and those 
loans and liabilit ies over 
$10,000. 

It is Fielding's job to prepare 
the gift list by May IS. ince 
Shiela Tale. Mrs. Reagan ' 
press secretary, revealed the 
ot her day t hat the fi r t lady 
ha been accepting designer 
clothes as gifts and loan ,the 
press will undoubtedly study 
Fielding's lis t wit h an elect ron 
microscope . 

According to Tate, Mrs. 
Reagan ' low·cost wardrobe 
"has done nothing but benefit 
the industry. She has derived 

no personal benefit ." 
These little outfits, one can 

bet, didn 't come off the rack s 
at J,C . Penney or Sear '. And if 
the first lady has received no 
··per.on a l · benefit from 
clothe presumably de:igned 
by Galanos. Adolfo, Bill Bl ass. 
Ha lson and ot hers, who has? 
We've seen no pre relea e 
announcing, "The House of 
Halston has loaned the first 
lady three gowns for the next 
three weeks." Nor has the 
Whi te House press office 
dec la red : " Mrs. Reagan's 
clothe for her New Year's 
weekend at t he Rancho Mi rage 
home of Walter Annenberg are 
on loan from Betty Barclay 
Sport swear, In ." 

According to the Govern· 
ment Ethics Office, whose 
employees understandably do 
not care to be identified, "The 
fir t lad y does not have to 
pu blicly disclo e clothes worth 
more than $35 if they are on

make public any such gifts. If 
the president accepts a gift of

t he same requirement pertains 
tohim ." 

A few days before Reaga n 's 
inauguration, M exica n 
President Lopes Portillo 
presented him wi th an 
Arabian s tallion . Because he 
had not yet been sworn in, the 
5t all ion belong ' to Reagan as a 
personal gift. 

Gifts from foreign nat ions or 
dignitaries to the president 
and the fir t lad y, on the other 
hand, are dealt wit h under the 
Foreign GIfts Act. which hold 
that s uch gifts are the 
propeny of the US govern· 
ment. S uch gifts are only 
di 'posable by auction or as the 
Department of State see fit. 

Does Fred Fielding fear a 
fu ll di closure of the Reagans' 
gifts thi pring? He ought to. 
As the nation learned at a 
White House press conference 

las t Tuesday. the president 
has reason to be sen sit ive 
about hi . personal wea lth . "I 
realize the publicity that has 
att ended upon the tax ret urns 
of someone in my position ," he 
told reporters. 

Moreover, millions of 
Americans are unemployed. 
Other thousands have been 
s tricken from the welfare and 

ocia l . ecurity di 'ability roll s. 
The rift bet ween the "haves 
and the have·nots" in this 
coun try seems to grow deeper 
each day. 

If Fielding di closes that 
Mrs. Reaga n has been blessed 
with, 100,000 worth of clothes 
s ince moving into the White 
House, t he support for her 
husband 's economic package 
could unravel. And if the 
clothes she wears are, in fact , 
not gift but loans, what are 
the particulars of the loan 
agreement? Who get s what for 
what? 

Of course, we may never see 

a I<eagan television appear· 
ance followed by the credit 
line: "The pres ident 's suit for 
tonight 's a ppea ran ce was 
furnished by Hart , Schaffner 
and Marx; shoes by Nunn 
Bu . ch; s hirt by Arrow; 
hairstyling by White House 
barber Milton Pitt s ... . " 

But let's face it : Th e 
Reagans a re old movie folk , 
and they know the Holl ywood 
tradition. In creenland. if you 
borrow somet hi ng. t he payoff 
is a credit line. 

I! may require Fielding's 
report to reveal which 
manufacturere dressed the 
fi rst lady for the sake of 
promotional benefit and which 
loa ned the White Hou'e 
merchandise simply for tax 
credits. 

May 15 may be a day to 
watch . It could reveal much

Opening of theater 
delayed until fall 

Controversy surrounds UC' 
plans for La Jolla Farms 

Due to fund·raising and 
equipment problems, the 
UCS D Mandell Wei ss 
Center for the Performing 
Arts will postpone its 
opening until fall quarter 
next year, according to 
Michael Addison, chairman 
of the drama department. 

The 500'seat theater, 
which was a joint venture 
between the university and 
the Arts Foundation of San 
Diego County, was schedul· 
ed to open May 20. 

According to Addison, the 
opening will be postponed 
until contracts can be 
drawn up for ins tallat ion of 
a unique light and sound 

system which was tailor 
made for the new theater. 
Also delaying the opening is 
the requirement that the 
theater meet state, federal , 
and city safety codes, 
Addison said. 

"Basically we need 
anywhere from a half 
million to $750,000 to get 
everything in place and paid 
for," Ray Ramseyer, 
director of fundrai sing 
activities at UCSD, said. 

Bertolt Brecht's "The 
Threepenny Opera," which 
was t he first play schedu led 
for t he new theater, has also 
been postponed.

not paying rent on time. 

The Univer ity of California 
had planned ahead . When the 
University of California at San 
Diego was small, the Board of 
Regents had the foresight to 
real ize that t he school was 
going to grow. The University 
took every chance to buy up 
land near the school so that 
they might easily expand if 
need be. La Jolla Farm was 
bought iri 1961 from Mr. Black. 
When it was bought it \\,as 
zoned as residential. as it tIll 
is today. Up until the time the 
UniverSI ty was to need the 
land it was to be used as 
stables. Now the l niversity

"The best days of the week 

for sex are those that start 
with T's : Tues day and 
Thursday, Today, Tomorrow, 
Taturday, and Tunday," Josh 
McDowell, a traveling 
Christian evangelist said 
Thursday night in his lecture 
entitled "Maximum Sex." 

McDowell, whose first name 
"Josh" has been seen on 
almost every blackboard on 
campus, s poke before an 
overflowing crowd in the 
Revelle cafeteria. 

To those in the audience 
who were expecting a 'fire and 
brimstone' type of evangelist, 
such as Brot her George "Jed" 
Smock who visited the campus 
two weeks ago, Josh came as 
quite a surprise. 

He did not preach about the 
evils of sex, nor did he say not 
to have sex. Josh's message 
was simply one which out lines 
his view on how to have the 
most fu lfill ing sex life 
possible.

In his lecture, Josh claimed 
that physical, mental, and 
psychological compatibility 
between partners are essential 
components in a maximum 
sex, love, and marriage 
relationship. "God intended all 
three (components) to be 
operational in a maximum 
relationship," said Josh. The 
lack of anyone of these 
components will produce a 
"watered ·down relationship," 
Josh Si\yS. 

Josh emphatically pointed 
out that a good sex life very 
seldom leads to contentment. 
He believes that maximum sex 
is the result rather than the 
cause of a fulfilling 
relationship. 

The ability to express one' 
love for his mate totally apart 
from the physical dimension 
adds a whole new meaning to 
the physical. 

"An attitude that robs a lot 
of people in the area of the 
physical is the attitude that 
sex is a once and fo r all even t," 

s tated Josh. Sex, in Josh's 
opinion, isn't something you 
just go out and have. 
"Every time you have sex, it is 
meaningful because it involves 
all that you are as an 
individual ," Josh said . . 

Josh ascertained that sex 
was meant to be with the right 
person in the right relation-
ship over a long period of time. 
This enables the two people to 
grow, mature, develop, and 
progres into a maximum 
oneness. According to Josh . it 
wou ld take a man and a 
woman an entire lifetime to 
enjoy the goodness of each 
other in this area. 

Josh went on to ci te three 
types of love on which 
relationship are based. He 
called the first the "I will love 
you if" atititude. Thi attitude 
attaches a requirement to 
one's love. Josh argued that 
those who are satisfied with 
this attitude never attain a 
maximum relationship.

Josh 
l'IlIllilllll' d Irom pa~l' ,-

Josh claimed that the second 
type of love also deprives a 
per so n of a fulfilling 
relationship because it 
produces competit ion, envy, 
jealousy, and fear. This, 
according toJo h, is the "[ love 
you because" attitude which 
bases one's love for another on 
a quality or a condition. 

In the third tr.pe of love, "I 
love you, period, 'onethink of 
the other per on first, and Josh 
claims, this type i ba ed not 
on what you can get, but 
rather on what you can give. 
According to Josh, this type of 
attitude develops into a very 
open relationship. 

"I a ked Chn 't to come into 
my life and to change me from 
the inside·out through a 
relationship, A a result of 
that. He so fulfilled me on the 
inside that He gave me the 
capacity to give without 
expecting anything in return." 

Josh encountered some 
opposition to Thursday's 
presentation when several 
demonstrators created a 
disturbance by pounding on 
the windows and displaying a 
banner which cited "Josh Is 
Dead!" 

This act did not seem to faze 
Josh and he immediately 
responded with "Dead to self 
and alive to the world."

"Christians are at war. War 

i. now," for Jerry Falwell and 
the moral majority explained 
Dr. Walter Capps in an open 
forum at the International 
Center la s t Wednesda y 
afternoon. 

Capps, who is a professor of 
religious studies at UCSB, 
analyzed the moral majority 
a nd other "conservative 
religion " during his lect ure 
"Vietnam and the Rise of 
Conservative Religion" 

One of Capps' maIO 
cri ticism was that conserva· 
tive religions are dependent on 
militancy, and proof of this IS 
found in the use of military 
terminology. 

Capps paraphrased Falwell , 
leader of the moral majonty, 
as sayi ng, "The local church is 
likened to have organized an 
army equipped for battle and 
ready to charge the enemy ... 
the church hou ld be a 
disciplined charging army ... 
bayonet in hand encounter the 
enemy face to face and one on 
one bring t he enemy under 
submission to the Gospel of 
Christ. " 

Capps fun her supports his 
view by examining the 
"Biblical view of the end of 
time" which tell ' of "warfare 
between God' · people and the 
godle s people." 

The focus of Capps' lecture 
was to analyze conservative 
religions and the period which 
followed Vietnam. 

According to Capps, the 
moral maiority is mobilizin~ 

for the next war, Armageddon, 
which is the Biblical name for 
the Third World War. The 
final conflict bet ween the 
Godly and the godle~~ ha 
already started for the moral 
majority: the Chrtstlan 
Capitali,t~ against the 
Communists. 

According to Capps, Falwell 
fun.her preaches It is the 
Chri5tian dUly to SlOp the 
communists, Capps para 
phrai>ed Falwell a5 ~aymg, 
"We are gomg to have at least 
1,010 year!) of peace when the 
Messiah comes, and thi!> Will 
happen in our generatIOn." 

Along With analY71ng the 
moral majortiy, Capps 
expressed his feelings. Capps 
sees our current !)it uation a~ 
"a continuation of the trauma 
of the Vietnam \\-'ar The 

Veteran~ are gomg to be the 
ones who remind u!> of what 
happened and will not allow us

La Jolla Farms: the development question 
. 

UCSD planners begin to solidify ideas for scenic land 
{'olll i nUl'd I rOIll page .i 

When asked what hewould 
like to see go up instead of a 
re earch and commercial 
center, Mrs. Simpson replied 
quite quickly: 

"Nothing. Just leave the 
land as it is . But I understand 
the Univer ity' need to raise 
money, and I under tand that 
the developers are trying to do 
their job a be t they can, and I 
under tand that the home· 
owner are angry. I would just 
like to see the land enjoyed, 
like it used to be enjoyed by the 
kids who rode here and i 
enjoyed by those who walk and 
jog here. We are all responsible 
for what is put here. It 's a 
hame that there won't be 

anything for the young who 
used to play on this property." 

If the project is passed by the 
Regent, the Simpsons will 
have to move out, though it i 
conceivable that they could 
continue living there for 

another three years. whIch is 
the length of time it takes for a 
zoning to be changed from 
residential to commercial. The 

imp on ay that UCSD ha 
been very gracious to them. 
They al 0 say that they feel 
helpless to what i going on. If 
the project is passed. their 
home would be converted into 
office space. 

"We just have to sit and 
watch. We're ju t average 
citizens who like this land . I 
just hope that if they do decide 
to build that it will be of use to 
the commu nity." 

••• 
The moment when all of this 

arguing and planning and 
worrying come together will 
be next Wednesday when 
Chancellor Atkinson will 
make a decision a to whether 
or not to approve t he plan 
when it goes to the Regent in 
Berkeley. One panel made up 
of faculty, administration and 

one student , has reviewed the 
plan and ha. recommended to 
Chancellor Atkinson that he 
recommend it when it goes to 
the Regents. The one student 
on the panel, Lee Gibbs, had 
this to say about the project. 

" It is an excellent plan as far 
as I am concerned." 

Gibbs, a senior who is 
majoring in Urban studies, is 
the only student to have any 
'ay in t he matter of 
development of the property, 
and he ha tudied the 
alternatives. One suggestion is 
to make the land student 
hou ing in tead of commer-
cial. 

"Student housing on that 
land is absurd. Why put it 
there when you could put it 
somewhere else? That land is 
very valuable as commercial 

pace. Anyway, with the 
money generated there the 
university cou ld afford to 
build elsewhere."

Although t he panel was 
object ive, Gibbs felt that the 
La Jolla Farms Homeowner's 
Associat ion operated out of 
"sheer greed for their property 
value." Gibbs also concede 
that t here are flaw with the 
plan. He feels that the 
commercial center needs to be 
bigger, and that there shou ld 
be no buffer bel ween 
development and community. 
He realizes this is exactly what 
the homeowners do not want 
but feels that there is little 
they can do about it. 

" I don't really know how to 
please t hem so I say don't even 
bother. By trying to please 
both the un iversity and the 
homeowners Sickels O'Brien 
might end up pleasing neither. 

"The e people will complain 
about anything," said Gibbs, 
"they complained about the 
smell of the horse manure 
when the stables used to be 
there. " 

The ufficial at Sickels 
O'Brien say they are 
sympathetic to t he needs of the 
homeowners, but can do lit! Ie 
to please them. 

"What can we do?" asked 
Mr. O'Brien. "What can we do 
for them? We 've tried to meet 
their demands but they still 
aren't happy. Another official 
summed up the situation. 

"If I lived on the farms I 
might be against this propo al. 
but I don't live on the farms." 

Thi Wedne day Chancellor 
Atkinson will listen to the 
presentation of the develop· 
ent, will listen to the 
homeowners, and will take 
into account a report made by 
a cross section of administra· 
tion and faculty . After 
conside ring this information, 
he will have to decide whether 
or not to come out for or 
against the project when it is 
presented to the Board of 
Regents in Berkeley.

Red tide present along San Diego's coast line 

BY DR. BERT N, KOBA YASHI 
This is the first of a sen'es of articles Ot! 

the marine environment, and I would 
appreciate mlY commet!ts that interested 
readers might have on the topics to be 
presented or on the amount of details. 
The series is intended to present the 
UCSD comm un ity with some facts about 
one signIficant aspect of our campus, the 
magnificent Pacific Ocean. I invite 
comment, questions, or even offers for 
futureartic/esfromyou. I can be reached 
at 455-0691 (home, recorded message) 
or 452·4032. My campus mail code is C· 
017. 

Just before the rains came last week, 
any visitor to the ocean water off San 
Diego noticed a very distinct brownish 
to reddish tinge to the water. Someone 
knowledgeable might even have 
pointed out to the visitor that this was 
due to a condition called red tide, 
rather than to some sewage spillage, as 
was described to me by one of my diver 
friends. What is this phenomenon 
called red tide, and how does it occur? 

A group of marine plants, 
specifically simple, microscopic algae 
called dinoflagellates, is the one most 
common ly respon ible for the 
condition of red tIde. 

The name dinoflagellates is derived 
from the presence of two flagella 
(singular flagellum) on the organism. 
These structures, which re emble a 
thick thread, are located such that the 
"tail" drives the plant through the 
water and the "body" flagella (lying in 
a groove around the girth of the plant) 
spins the plant as it moves forward . 

Dinoflagellates are part of an 
interesting group of organisms. Some 
of them are autotrophic - i.e., they are 
entirely plant-like, undergoing 
photosynthesis when conditions are 
appropriate. Still others are animal-
like in the production of lving 
substances. Thus, dinoflagellates have 
been claimed by botani t and 
zoologists alike, resulting in some 
confusion in taxonomy. 

These yellow-brown phytoplankton 
(floating plants) are among the largest 
of all the microscopic form ; in certain 
conditions, the population of 
d inoflagellate(s) in a local area 
undergoes tremendous reproductive 
rate increases so that concentrations 
up to 50-60 million cells per cubic 
meter of sea water are affected. These 
blooms are rarely observed until their 
development is virtually complete, so 

that events which lead to red tides 
remain enigmatic . 

The literature, summarized by 
Rounsefell and Nelson reveals certain 
conditions which frequently precede 
outbreaks of red tide. Those commonl y 
reported include heavy rainfall (we 
had such a heavy rainfall in early 
January), calm unny weather (we had 
such a stretch of nice weather just 
before this last rain), an influx of 
estuarine waters, and the meeting of 
dissimilar water masses. 

What probably happens with each of 
these conditions is an increase in the 
vertical stability of the water column, 
either by an increase in the density 
gradient or by a decrease in the wind-
induced vertical coefficient of eddy 
diffusion . This merely means that 
there is a reduction in the mixing of 
surface and deeper waters, which 
allow motile organisms such as 
dinoflagellates to concentrate more 
easily in preferred layers where light is 
optimal for reproduction. 

This focus leads to an increase in the 
average reproductive rate, resulting in 
the bloom condition called red tide. 
With ca lm, sunny weather, the 
scattering of light due to ripplingofthe 
surface will be minimal, the level of 
illumination reaching the dinoflagel-
lates will thus be maximal, and the 
effect will be further amplified . Last 
week's red tide condition was probably 
promulgated initially by the heavy 
rain, with the subsequent calm, sunny 
weather contributing to the rapid rate 
increase as the week progressed. 

How does the red tide become 
terminated under natural conditions? 
The few authorc; who have reported on 
such conditions have suspected that 
an increase in wind strength i 
respon sible. Such an increase would 
bring about an increase in vertical 
mixing, leading to a cat ~ering of the 
dinoflagellates and also making them 
more u ceptible to grazing by the 
herbivorous animal form . 

What are the effect of red tide on 
the eco ystem' Without attempting to 
define any but theones which are most 
pertinent to the human species, such a 
bloom of tiny plants must have a 
dramatic effec t on the energy 
consideration of an eco ystem. The 
dinoflagellates responsible for the red 
tides are bioluminescent creatures, 
meaning that they emit a cold , blue 
light when mechanically agitated. 
Some of us who actually venture into 

the oceans at night are keenly aware of 
the beautiful. bluish sparkle 
produced by waving our arms through 
the water column in the dark . When 
the red tide is especially prevalent, a 
fish wimming through the water can 
be followed by the streak of blue light it 
leaves. Footprints on the sand as a 
person or a dog goes running on the 
wet beach at night are often seen 
during the e conditions. Sailors have 
often commented on the eerie glow 
that the wake of the boat make as the 
keel knifes through the water at night. 
The waves exhibit a bluish hueas they 
break close to short at night during 
break red tide conditions. The actual 
visibility through the water column i 
extremely limited due to the multitude 
of organisms pre ent but the blue 
sparkles are readily seen. 

A second effect that is readily 
observable at times is the huge "fish 
kills" that occur with a dense red tide. 
Such a mortality of fish is due to a 
couple of reason . As a probable 
defense mechanism developed to 
protect against grazing, ome of the 
dinoflagellates secrete a toxin. In the 
case of certain fishe , thi toxin 
prevent the rapid uptake of dissolved 

oxygen through the gill s tructure and 
the re ult is a large "fish kill. " The 
other cause of a massive kill is the 
reduction in oxygen concentration of 
the surrounding water. The large 
number of plants (dinoflagellates) 
" 'respiring" at night (utilizing oxygen) 
depletes the water column of mo t of 
the tore of di solved oxygen, and an 
oxygen-demanding fi sh such as an 
anchovy will actually uffocate in 
these conditions. This is especially 
prevalent in shallow waters , notably 
in bay and estuarie . 

The o·called shellfish , or mussel , 
poi oning that res ults from the 
consumption of shellfish such as 
mu sels, oyster , clam , and scallops 
is actually due to the concentration of 
the toxin that is secreted by the 
dinoflagellates in the e filter·feeding 
s hellfish . Although incidences of 
s hellfish poi soning are virtually 
unknown in southern California 
(south of Point Conception), there have 
been more than 80 fatalities in 
nort hern California. Last year , there 
were 4 deaths rep0rted in Sacramento 
from a party of shellfish-eaters who 
had gotten them from Bodega Bay the 
previous day. Another death was

Scripps scientist dies 
Dr. Theodore Enns , a former 

researcher at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography . UCSD, died 
Wednesday . January 20 at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital of lung cancer. 

Professor William A. Nierenberg, 
director of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, said, "Dr. Enns was a 
dedicated teacher and a productive 
researcher who played a key role in the 
development of the Physiological 
Research Laboratory at Scripps. He 
will be sorely missed by the many 
faculty, staff, and students who 
enjoyed working with him over the 
years." he said. 

Dr. Enns was one of the first 
appointments at the Physiological 
Research Laboratory of Scripps when 
it began in 1963 under the direction of 
the late Dr. Per F. Scholander. In more 
recent years. Dr. Enns was in the 
Marine Biology Research Division of 
Scripps. 

Although at first his scientific 
endeavors were as a physicist, he 
turned to physiological studies early in 
his career. His research at Scripps 
Institution covered a wide range of 
subjects concerned with the transport 
of gases, water, and electrolytes within 
the tissues of various animals and 
some plants. Among these studies was 
extensive research in red blood cells in 
humans and the importance of 
Vitamin C for the health of cells. 

He also studied how urea formed in 
harks, specifically the horns hark. 

But, as with all studies of physical 
systems. results of this and his other 
work has spin·ofts for basic research in 
medicine and other discipline . 

He was a prolific author, producing 
nearly 100 scientific publications. and 
enjoyed lecturing and working with 
graduate students at Scripps. He was 
cochairman of several doctoral 

committees of Scripps student and 
had a reputation of being particularly 
generous with his time and research 
equipment and patient during the 
many Questions students must ask in 
their intellectual evolution. 

Dr. Enns. a naturalized American 
citizen. was born in the village of 
Alexanderkrone in Russia on January 
10. 1916. and emigrated to Canada 
with his parents and sisters in 1924. 
He earned his Bachelor of Engineering 
degree from the University of 
Saskathcewan (Saskatoon. Canada) in 
1937. and then entered the United 
States to attend the University of 
Rochester in New York state. 

He received his Ph.D. in physics 
from the University of Rochester in 
1940. served one year at the University 
of Washington in St. Louis, Missouri, 
and then returned to the University of 
Rochester from 1941 to 1946. During 
this period, he worked on the 
Manhattan Project. in the Radiology 
Department of the Rochester Medical 
School under the late Dr. Stafford 
Warren. He then served at the 
Franklin Institute ' Biochemical 
Research Foundation in Newark, 
Delaware. 

Dr. Enns was an assistant and 
associate professor at Johns Hopkins 
School of Medicine, Baltimore. 
Maryland, from 1948 until 1964. He 
simultaneously became a research 
phYSIOlogist at Scripps Institution in 
1962, and continued at Scripps until 
his retirement in 1979. 

He has recei ved n u merou 
recognitions for hi contribution. 
including the Gugegenheim 
Fellow hip and a Fulbright Grant in 
1956·57. with which he spent a year of 
research and study at the Institute of 
Zoophysiology is Oslo. Norway.

Red tide in waters

reported of a scuba diver who had 
co llected sca llops (previous ly 
unimplicated in any fatalities) from 60' 
and had eaten them fresh out of the 
shell. My general rule-of·thumb is that 
whenever red tide is visible. I will not 
eal any filter·feeder from those 
water . Since abalone is a grazer. 
feeding on macroscopic algae, it is 
unaffected by red tide conditions. 

I am often asked how long one 
should wait to once again feed on such 
s hellfi sh after the red tide is 
dissipated . There is no concrete 

evidence for an exact time sequence. 
but I would wait at least two (2) week 
before thinking about ingesting 
shellfish taken from those waters. 
Without making elaborate biochemical 
analy es, it is impossible to determine 
whet her any shellfish is laden with the 
toxin, and cooking does not offset or 
negate the effect of the toxin.

UC research trips 
As federal support of research 

continues to ebb, an innovative 
program at the University of 
California is inviting members of the 
general public to take an active role in 
the effort to salvage scientific field 
research in the natural and social 
sciences. 

Investigating possible links between 
diet and disease in traditional African 
communities, exploring marine 
environments for the resources 
valuable as tomorrow's medicines and 
studying the application of ancient 
Mayan farming techniques in modern 
Mexico are just a few areas of inquiry 
where pu blic participation can make a 
difference in continuing important 
re earch. 

The University Research 
Expeditions Program is currently 
recruit ing members of the general 
public for these and other small 
research expedition teams working in 
the United States and abroad . The 
Berkeley based program provides an 
inno\';\tive alternate funding ource

The UCSD Guardian 
Andrew Keeler, Arts Editor TheA t Page 13 January 25. 1982 
Atotnicafe opens 
'82 season Tues. 

New line-up of UCSD composers 
The UCSD contemporary composer series Atomicafe will 

present it first concert of the 1982 season Tuesday at 8 p.m. in 
Mandeville Recital Hall. Atomicafe has been noted in the past for 
producing provocative mixtures of .. erious" music and the 
comically sublime, along with an occasional piece unclassifiable 
by any standard categories. 

This concert will present eight works by even graduate 
student composers and one undergraduate, with a wide variety 
of instrumentation and compositional aims displayed. 

Victor Zupanc's Whisper Louise is a tender. serious work for 
the solo flute. Computer· musician George Bloch's other main 
interet being the opera music of Verdi. he has written a solo cello 
work, La Vallee des Larmes, in the form of an operatic recitative 
and aria. contrasting two registers of the cello. Igor . 
Korneitchouk 's Birthday Suit for solo oboe derives its name from 
being dedicated to an obstetrician friend of the composer. and 
uses the natural body rhythms of the performer. including eyelid 
movements . to organize the flow of mu ical material. 

Tom Riley's Apocalypse draws in visual aids in an attempt. as 
he describes it, to "ascend to the unbearable, conquer 
redundancy, obliterate the annoying, dissociate the routine. 
dissolve the predictable. but predict the future." Indeed. Randy 
Begault's Two a Second for flute and clarinet describes the 
relationship between restriction and dis onance. Carlo 
Landini 's Intennezzo per Ire /lau/; was performed on French 
Radio in January of 1980 and, according to the composer. might 
be described a "a gathering of time and timbre." 

Atomicafe is free and open to all students, taff, faculty and 
the public. Atomicafe will also present two more concerts during 
this quarter, on Feb. 9 and Feb. 23. 

For more information call the Music Department at 452-3230. 
This unique group of people compose the nucleus of the Atomicafe, a series of compositions by 
UCSD students and staff, which wiU present its first concert of 1982 this Tuesday night .

After the rule of Mao Tse Tung came to an end, a veil which 

had obscured China from the re t of the world wa lifted. A 
result of this new openness was a cultural exchange between 
America and China. Part of this exchange included a visit by 
violinist Isaac Stern to China in June of 1979. The film From Mao 
10 Mozarl documents thi visit. 

An independently· made. non-profit movie, From Mao to 
Mozart is about. appropriately enough, music and China. 
Anyone with a pa!:sing intere t in either subject will be well· 
rewarded by seeing this film . 

Stern's trip. a type of diplomacy through music, con i ted of 
visits to music conservatories in Peking and ShanghaI and two 
performances by Stern , 

Stern, the sometime narrator, is the central figure of the film 
and, indeed . makes the film enjoyable. Hi boyish manner and 
obvious enthusiasm for mu ic brighten and color each cene. 

Many of the young musician ,however, capture the pot light 
for brief moments . Their talent and youth impres Stern and the 
movie audience alike, promising a high international standing 
for Chinese musicians in the future .

The famou8 Lar Lubovitch Dance Company will perfonn at Mandeville on WednellClay. 

Lubovitch Dance C!>mpany 
on catnpus Wednesday 

The Lar Lubovitch Dance Company, an 
ensemble which has won critical acclaim for its 
appearances in the United States and Europe, 
will perform at 8 p.m. Wednesday, in the 
Mandeville Center Auditorium. 

The 10-member company, formed in 1968 by 
choreographer Lar Lubovitch, has toured in 
Europe and the Middle East, appearing at the 
Spoleto Festival, the Holland Festival, and at 
major theaters in Sweden, France, Italy, 
Germany and Canada. In addition, it has 
toured in the United States under the auspices 
of the National Endowment for the Arts Dance 
Touring Program. 

Although primarily choreographing for his 
own company, Lubovitch's works have been 
performed by the American Ballet Theater, 
Alvin Ailey Dance Company , Stuttgart Ballet , 
Les Grand Ballet Canadien and companies in 
Lisbon. Paris, Tel-Aviv and Canada. 

Lubovitch came from Chicago to begin hi 
dance training at the Juilliard School. For six 
years he danced with several modern and 
classical companies, including the Harkness 

B~llet, until October of 1968 when he presented 
hIS own dances for the first time. In 1977 he 
stopped dancing professionally to develop 
works solely for his company. 

"Lubovitch has a way of creating exultation 
in dance," wrote Clive Barnes in The New York 
Times. "His choreography has a very strong 
pulse to it, he uses a free-style vocabulary that 
takes from classic ballet with a difference, and 
he creates with a certain objective awareness." 

The UCSD performance is sponsored by the 
University Events Office. General admission

New group helps perfortners 
Encinitas based outfit counsels interested songwriters 

By LANCE ABBOTT 
Breaking into show 

business isn't easy these days. 
Not long ago, all it took was a 
tight weater and a few hours 
leaning on the bar at the malt 
shop, and bingo, you were 
discovered _ But today's 
aspiring song writers, singers. 
and performers need help with 
everything from their 
material, to production of 
demo- tapes, to making 
important professional 
contacts. [t is precisely this 
need that a new organization, 
Songwriters, Arti s ts and 
Service (SAS), intends to fill. 

The idea behind SAS is to 
provide workshops for area 
artists taught by experienced 
professionals that will impart 
both the fundamentals of 
mu s i c and the polish 
necessary for a professional 
career. The workshops 
beginning February 1. are 
Lyric Writing, Beginning 
Songwriting , Intermediate 
Songwriting, Advanced 
Songwriting, and a special 
workshop for people already 
performing. Fees for the 
courses begin at $60 and range 
to $100 with meetings once a 

Joan Nemour is a veteran of 15 
years in the music publishing 
industry and Sid Bulkin, who 
will be teaching most of the 
classes. has spent 40 years as a 
jazz drummer (with the likes 
of Benny Goodman), a band 

Kelly Bulkin 

week for four weeks. manager ar id producer, and 
Conceived and run by Joan music publisher. 

Nemour and Sidney Bulkin, SAS is based in Encinitas, 
SAS is an outgrowth of and when asked about the 
Nightingale'produCtions, Inc.. location 1'{ernour said. "We've 
a mu ic publishing company. - been in Hollywood for more 

than 30 years now which is 
really the center for the music 
business. but we've been 
living in Encinitas for the last 
five years and wejust thought 
there must be a way to draw 
the talent that we know is 
down here, and to somehow 
bring it to the attention of the 
mainstream of the music 
industry." 

Working with SAS and 
teaching one of the workshops 
will be John Ford Coley , late of 
England Dan and JFC fame. 
Now working with Leslie and 
Kelly Bulkin, Coley pitched 
the value of an SAS workshop. 
Certainly t he chance a t 
professional contacts should 
interest naiscent North 
County arti ts, but perhaps 
the sounds advice regarding 
the new organization came 
from Bulkin . 

"Songwriting is a craft," he 
said, "one that takes hard 
work and dedication and 
without great determination 
well...you must be dedicated to 
your craft before you come to 
one of our workshp ." 

SAS will also provide 
consu ltation for a fee and 
hopes to add to talent and 
desire some important 
technique. For more informa-

Perfect tennis 
BY PAUL AMBROGIO 

Looking like they were going 
t o be d efeated. with 
qualification for the NCAA 
tournament on the line. the 
men's tenni team salvaged a 

. 5·4 victory over Pomona· 
Pit zer. 

Saturday morning's match 
at the Muir courts was tied 3-3 
after the singles contests. The 
thre e doubl es matc hes 
determined the outcome. 

Jones went on to convincing-
Iy take the following two sets 
displaying devast at ing control 
on the angles of his shots. 
Jones' bu lIet ·like topspin shots 
exploded off hi racket curving 
downward as they pas:ed the 
net. 

Lee Morrow beat. the competition off the blocka as she wins the 400 Individual Medley 
Saturday alainst UC Irvine. The women'. 200 freestyle relay became the fint team to 
qualify for Div. III Nationals as the Tritons beat UCI after l08illl Friday to aaremont. 
Sandy Groas qualifie. for N alional. in the 200 Fly, while Morrow did the same in the 400 
1M, 200 and 100 Fly. 

The Tritons captured the 
fi rs t co mplet ed double 
contest but were be ing 
trampled in the two remaining 
ones. Uneasiness was showing 
as the team of Dave Taber and 
Brad Driver were down 1-3, 
and Eugene jones and Everett 
Gee were behind 0·3 in their 
respective third and deciding 
sets. But Taber and Driver 
responded with the gutsiest 
comeback of t he day , clinching 
the victory for the Tritons. 

Gee also looked impressive 
in crushing Brian Rose 6·2,6-2. 
Gee is extremely quick both in 
footspeed and reflexes. and 
pos sesses a fantastic 
reperto ir e of s hots. He

Last year's team was 17·10 
ove rall and seventh in 
Division III of the NCAA. With 
four ret urning freshmen coach 
Peter Davis is quite optimistic 
about the young season . 
During the matches Davis 
stresses the mental aspect of 
the game with his players,

they are and are not doing 
right. " It was a good win for 
us," he interjected after the 
game.

on a three minute, 15 point 
blast that left the Leopards 
hanging. Coach Malone keyed 
the Triton second half 
performance by using a 1-2·2 
ht1lf·court press that baffled 
the Leopards or " Lepers" 
depending on who was yelling 

The surprise of the game 
was so phomore forward 
Brenda Sweatt; the arch, 
backspin , and total form of her 
s hot, which produced 14 
points. would have pleased 
even the most demanding of 
college s hooting coaches. 
Sweatt also played point on 
the half court press and 
rebounded extremely well

Tritons topple Fresno 
continued from page 17 
Fresno Pacific only eleven 
chances. One of those eleven, 
however, sent the game into 
overtime after the Tritons let a 
ten point lead slip away. 

With 33 seconds left to play 
in the second half Wight drove 
up the middle and was fouled 
in the bonus situat ion. After 
he dropped in both ends of a 
one-and-one the Tritons had a 
three point advantage, 55-52, 
but the Sunbirds would not be 
denied. After a tip-in under the 
Fresno basket the visitor 
pressed and stole the ball. and 
with just three ticks left 
Sunbird guard Rich Rankin 
fou nd himself in a one and one, 
with a chance to win the game. 
After t he sturdy player 
dropped in the first of his two 

.chances to even things up at 
55, a UCSD timeout worked to 
warm the icewater in the 
Fresno guards' veins and his 
second attempt failed . 

It was time to test the 
Tritons stamina in overtime 
for the third time in five home 
games this season. 

There is a play in the Triton 
book that calls for one of the 
two guards to jump toward the 
hoop from the side and receive 
an alleyoop pass from the 
outside and lay it in. Saturday 
night Bob Goodman got the 
call and the pass from Wight 
was right on target. With that 
UCSD never once looked back 

in the overtime period. 
although it took four clutch 
freethrows by Triton reserve 
Todd Beach and an impressive 
slam dunk by Wight to put the 
game away . The crowd, 
needless to say, went "nuts." 

"We went with our treng'lh 
in the guard positions and it 
payed off. The whole team 
pulled together and wasn't 
about to let another overtime 
game slip by," said UC coach 
John Block. 

Both Wight and freshman 
center Mike Daba in kas 
played the entire five minutes 
of overtime with four foul 
apiece, Dabasin ka ending 
the night with eighteen 
rebounds and five points. "We 
didn't even think about the 
fouls. We just went in and 
played our game and in the end 
were fortunate enough to have 
things fall our way," said 
Wight. 

Tomorrow evening the 
Tritons will travel to Azusa 
Pacific College for a 7:30 p.m. 
contest against one of the be t 
teams in the NAJA league. 
APC 10 t by only one point to 
national leader Biola College 
earlier thi sea on, a team 
which handed UCSD a 37 
point loss la t Saturday. "We 
can beat Biola ," aid Block. "If 
we use our heads and play 
consistently." The Tritons 
will return home on Thursday 
to play Southern Cal College.

Volleyball's men follow 
women's tough. act 

By SCOTT ALLISON 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team has a tough act to follow. 
Just last month their female 
counterparts, led by two All-
Americans, captured the 
NCAA championship trophy, 
trou ncing virtually every 
opponent along the way. 

This year's men's team will 
feature no Al1-Americans. And 
they will win no NCAA 
championship. By the end of 
the season they may be 
fortunate to be at the .500 
mark. But it won't be becau e 
UCSD is suiting up a bad 
men's vol1eyball team -
they're actually quite talented 
and deep at every position. It's 
ju t that by volleyball 
standards, UCSD is fielding a 
team of midgets. 

The Tritons' lack of ize 
played a major role in their 11 -
15, 15- 10, 7-15, 7-15 10 s to 
Loyola Marymount la t Friday 
night in the main gym. Loyola 
wa simply bigger and taller 
and height is as important to a 
volleyball player as speed is to 
a track athlete. 

The average height of a 
UCSD spiker i about ix feet, 
wherea the average height of 
an opposing player is often 
three to six inche taller. "We 
just don't match up phy ically 
to most teams," ay UCSD 
coach Doug Dannevik, "which 
mean we have to work that 
much harder to win." 

The Tritons this year are led 
by two eniors, setter Adam 

Cherry, who is listed at 5' 10", 
and hitter Hal Jacobs, who is 6' 
3". Jim Bishop, Rick Cazares, 
Monte Frankel and Hal Light 
are all savvy veterans who will 
see a lot of action this year, 
while freshmen David Halgren 
and Brian Nessim are vying 
for a starting spot. 

The spikers may not be tall, 
"but we have a great deal of 
depth," say Dannevik. "Right 
now we lack confidence. We 
s houldn 't, though , because 
we're a good team." 

Along with UCSD in the 
Western Collegiate Volleyball 
Conference are tough Cal 
State Northridge, UC 
Riverside, La Verne and Cal-
Poly San Luis Obisp,<>o "We can 
win our league, ' predicts 
Dannevik, who esquad begins 
conference play Friday, 
February 12 versus Riverside 
at home. 

The Tritons' next home 
game is tomorrow night, when 
they face San Diego State at 
7:30 p.m. 

Wrestling Saturday 
The Third Annual Intramural Wrestling Tournament will be 

held thi Saturday.J an. 30, in UCSD's main gym. Matches begin 
at 10 a.m. ' and go throughout the day. Every participant is 
guaranteed at least two opportunities. There will be 12 weight 
divisions and 1M coordinator Scott Berndes expects 75-85 
wrestler . CIF officials will monitor the action, with California 
Inter cholastic Federation rules in effect. Berndes has made 
allowances for out-of-shape athletes and has announced that all 
match periods WIll be cut to one minute. 

Kegger Feb. 13 
Athletes from all Triton Intercollegiate teams are welcomed to 

the TlAA meeting Monday night, 9 p.m., in the North 
Conference Room of the Student Center. The gathering, 
according to TlAA President Bob Conlin is to "further the 
development of a dance Feb. 26 on the hump." The organization 
will also discuss the quantity and brand of beer for the Feb. 13 
post-volleyball game kegger. All students, faculty and staff 
interested in athletics at UCSD are welcome to attend .
