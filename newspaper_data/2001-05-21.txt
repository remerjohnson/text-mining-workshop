Sun God Prayers Come True 
Ping Pong Mofia, Naughty by Nature, XZibit and Face to Face perform 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

The students' faith in the A.S. 
programming office was restored 
Friday as Ping Pong Mafia, 
Naughty by Nature, Face to Face 
and XZibit took the stage for this 
year's Sun God Festival at RlMAC 
Field. 

"This show was twice as good 
as Sun God was last year." said 
Revelle junior Jennifer 
Thompson. "Unlike last time, I 
didn't have to find the CDs of the 
bands that were playing in the 
oldies section of the music store." 

Co-Festivals Coordinator SCOtt 
Mantell said this year's Sun God 
drew 12,000 individuals, represent-
ing a clear increase over last year. 

"Man, I knew there would be 
more people th is year than th'ere 
were last year," said Marshall 
sophomore Scott Corban. "But I 
never thought I would have to wait 
in such a long line for a show." 

According to Co-Festivals 
Coordinator Priya Mohan, the 
large attendance was due in part 
to the wide range of people that 
the show catered to. 

"There was just something for 
everybody this time: she said. 
"You have got your punk rock, 
your hip-hop with Naughty by 
Nature, your real rap with XZibit, 
and then you have your chant 
with Electronico dance. We tried 
to make everybody happy this 
year and I hope that actually hap-
pened." 

Many of the 12,000 in atten-
dance said that the headliner 
XZibit lived up to the expecta-
tions that were placed upon him 
after his "Restless" album went 
double platinum. 

"XZibit was awesome: said 
Muir sophomore Robert Buckley.

AFT and UC Reach Contract Stalemate 
AFT demands that policies regarding nontenured track facu lty not be continued 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

The University of California 
American Federations has stopped 
negotiations on a new contract for 
nontenured faculty until a mediator 
can be hired to settle the debate that 
has been raging for over a year. 

"The problem is that the 
administration is not willing to 
modify an agreement that has 
been in place since the mid '80s: 
said local UCAFT chapter presi-
dent Fred Lonidier. "It badly needs 
to be improved." 

The policies included in the last 
contract, which expired JU';Ie 30 of 

last year, are still being used until a 
new agreement can be found . 

Regardless, this does not mean 
that UCAFT has accepted the 
conditions of the old contract. 
Lonidier said that the ambiguous 
nature of the contract makes it 
impossible to understand. 

"It will bend your mind: he said. 
"We want something that is clear." 

Under current legislation , a 
teacher who is on track to become 
a tenured faculty member must 
serve a six-year term before he is 
given a chance to receive tenure. 

However, Lonidier said teach-
ers are hired for four or five years 
and then are mysteriously fired for 

no reason. 
"[TeachersJ reach their fourth or 

fifth years and they are removed: 
he said. "We need something to 
make it clear that when they are get-
ting close to 18 quarters that we 
actually get there." 

Similar problems arise for teach-
ers who are on the nontenured 
track. According to UCAF/" Vice 
President David Kuchta, working as 
a lecturer provides no job security 
because an evaluation of one's job is 
administered every three years. 

He said this provides for a poor 
working environment because lec-
turers are in constant fear of losing 
their jobs. 

"A job shouldn't be something 
that you have to reapply for every 
three years," he said. "As long as 
you are doing your job, you shou ld 
have expectations that you can 
teach without the possibility of 
losing your job." 

Kuchta believes that this lack of 
security has decreased t.he quality 
of education fo r students, becau c 
lecturers ca n no longer take 
chances with their lessons. 

These nontenured trdck faculty 
members have to follow the con-
ventional form of teaching because 
if they try a new style and it's not 

See CONTRACT, Page 2 



2 NEWS 

Contract: 
AFT claims UC keeps 
lecturers from getting hired 
Continued from page 1 
popular among students, then students 
will give them a bad teaching evaluation 
and they could lose their jobs. 

"There is no academic freedom to 
challenge your students: he said. 
"That is why you are at college." 

In addition, Kuchta sa id that stud-
ies have shown that students' grades 
are inflated when lecturers teach the 
classes. Nontenured faculty members 
give their students better grades hop-
ing this will encourage them to give 
their teachers better evaluations at the 
end of the quarter. 

"This waters down the teaching:' 
he said. 

Hiring more nontenured faculty also 
hurts ten ured faculty members because 
they are fo rced to oversee the jobs of the 
lecturers. More time is spent evaluating 
the lecturers and performing adminis-
trative duties, with less time spent on 
teaching and research. 

Regardless of these claims, 
Chancellor Robert Dynes said the cur-
rent system is fair and reasonable. 

"There is no problem here," he 
said. "You have tenured faculty and 
nontenured facul ty - it is as simple as 
that." 

According to Kuchta, over 50 per-
cent of the classes at UCS D are taught 
by lecturers who receive considerably 
less pay than tenured faculty members 
do. Thi s percentage translates to 
approximately 160 nontenured faculty 
members at UCSD. 

"We are a permanent part of this 
campus," he said. "We want recogni-
tion of that. " 

There are many other points under 
scrutiny by the AFT as well. They say 
tha t one problem is the lack of free 
timc given to these nontenured facul-
ty mcmbers who have no chance to 
complete any independent research or 
studies to further their chance of 
attaining a tenured position. 

Unlike tenured faculty members, 
nOI1lcnured teachers receil'e no sab-
baticals or Academic Senate grants. 
Lonidier said this distinction also 
makes it vcry difficult to receive any 
type of merit as a faculty member. 

"If you are not tenured faculty, you 
are competing against those who are." 
Lonidier said. "It is very hard to do 
much more than teach. This is typical 
of higher education administrations. 
They have turned to nontenured track 
faculty for 30 or +0 years now because 
they are cheap. They JUSt want to save 
money." 

Kuch ta said that alt hough there is a 
2 percent pay increase each consecu-

. tive year one works as a lecturer, the 
salary does not compare to that of a 
tenured fac ulty member. 

Nontenured faculty members make 
about $60,000 per year while tenured 
faculty can make up to $1 30,000. 

But more importantly to the non-
tenured faculty, the possibility always 
remains that a teacher would not be 
given the opportunity to teach the right 
number of classes that qualifies him or 
her for such benefits as medical care, 
dental care and a retirement fund. 

"They are not guaranteed any-
thing," Lonidier said. "Teachers drop 
in and out of coverage all the time." 

[n order to receive benefits in most 
departments, lecturers must teach at 
least 50 percent of a full-time load. For 
a standard department, this number is 
about nine per year. [f a teacher does 
not teach at least five classes, he or she 
is not given any benefits. 

"This isn 't by choice," Lonidier 
said. "This kind of system is wrong. 
They should be replaced by regular 
appointments." 

Lonidier said that although a strike 
with the UC Regents over these issues 
is unlikely, the possibility still remains 
beca use lega lly the teachers are 
allowed to do so. 

"I don 't know if it 's impossible," he 
sa id. "We have a no-strike clause, but 
we also have no contract. It's an 
option." 

Although a med iator has been 
hired to rework the current contract, 
Kuchta said he is skeptical of a quick 
settlement because the previous con-
tract took three years to write.

Sun God: 
Naughty by Nature 
picked up fence after rush 
ContInued'from PICe 1 
he is rapping about only makes 
him that much better." 

Members of the A.S. 
Programming staff said that XZibit 
became a popular replacement for 
Sun God once Lenny Kravitz 

refu~ed to play for the $100,000 
offered to him earlier this month. 

"I thought XZibit was awesome 
because in underground rap, he gets 
a lot of respect: said Spencer Yee, 
Warren College representative to the 
A.S festivals committee. urn the 
mainstream he is also big-time." 

XZibit played for about 45 min-
utes in the rain after his set started 
at 10:30 p.m. 

While the crowd was dancing 
midway through XZibit's perfor-
mance, some fans in front by the 
stage began pushing people behind 
them, thereby triggering a massive 
domino effect that caused about 
150 individuals in attendance to 
fall over. 

"People were pushing and the 
cen~ei' gave way," said Gabe 
Grossman, Muir representative to 
the festivals committee. "Everyone 
just kind of fell in there. People 
were just getting crushed and 
everything collapsed." 

Mantell praised XZibit for what 
he told the crowd concerning the 
pushing issue, which ensured that 
it would not happen again . 

"XZibit was a total class act by 
saying 'let's all just help each other 

out and don 't push and enjoy 
yourself," Mantell said. "These a~e 
kind of class acts for what he IS 
doing and what he is about." 

Mantell said that Naughty by 
Nature helped pick up the fence 
once it fell over as they were watch-
ing XZibit's performance on the 
side of the stage. 

Face to Face played third in the 
show right before XZibit. Mohan 
said that they too put on a show 
worthy of applause. 

"Face to Face obviously has a 
big following," she said. "And they 
are not sell-out punk like Blink 
182. It is real and credible: 

Students who only came to hear 
the rap music were surprised by 
what they heard with Face to Face. 

"Before [ got here, [ only knew 
that Face to Face was the band that 
was playing between Naughty by 
Nature and XZibit," Thompson 
said. "But [ am glad that [ got to 
hear them play today because oth-
erwise I never would have listened 
to their music, and I really liked it." 

Naughty by Nature provided 
similar enjoyment for their fans. 

"Ever since 'Hip Hop Hooray: 
like, seven years ago, I have loved 
these guys," said Warren freshman 
Jeff Yee. "They may be old-school, 
but they still put on a good show." 

Members of the band recipro-
cated these feelings of praise to the 
fans who came to watch their per-
fo rmance at 7:50 p.m. 

"We anticipated a good crowd, 
but it is great to see when you final-
ly get there and it all comes togeth-
er," said lead lyricist Vinne. The 
show was off the hook and the kids 
had a lot of energy out there: 

The UCSD Guardian 

As a result of such support, 
Vinne said the show reached its full 
potential. 

"We have been performing for a 
long time so even if the crowd is 
dead, we'll just act like we are out 
there doing a dress rehearsal or 
something," he said. "But when the 
crowd is totally into it, it brings the 
show to a whole new level." 

Ping Pong Mafia, the winners of 
UCS D's Battle of the Bands, was 
the first band to take the stage. 

People who came to see them 
said their performance at Sun God 
was a clear indication of why they 
were the chosen winners at the 
Battle of the Bands. 

"Personally, [ liked their stuff," 
said Muir junior John Fontana. 
"For a UCSD band, they really sur-
prised me." 

Members of the DJs and 
Vinylephiles Club were spinning in 
a second tent from 6:30 p.m. to 
midnight. 

[n addition to the bands playing 
at night, members from student 
organizations set up booths and 
sold food, drinks and entertain-
ment from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the 
Sun God lawn and Library Walk, 

The success of this year's Sun 
God, however, was due in part to 
luck, according to Mohan. 

"[t is the same reasons last year 
that we got Dishwalla" she said. "It 
is just because of artists' availabili-
ty. We got kind of lucky this time, [ 
guess - that's all. You always try 
your hardest but sometimes things 
don't happen for various reasons. 
Some of them are for money, but 
some of them are availability and 
that sort of thing. You never know."

President Bush's missile defense system is flawed and will do 
nothing but instigate other nations into an arms race 
By VISIW. PATEL 
Staff Writer 

President George W. Bush recently 
expressed his plan to build a missile 
defense system. His plan calls for a drastic 
increase in ,military funding to create a 
shield to keep America safe from missile 
attacks. While this plan seems to be clear 
and appropriate in its attempt for the bet-
terment of America, many have been 
prompted to ask whether the plan is truly 
called for and should be put into place by 
Bush, I follow in their voices in arguing 
against the establishment of a missile 
defense system. 

In order to have a missile defense sys-
tem, Bush would have to withdraw from 
the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty of 1972, a diplomatic 

sia has already expressed a disagreement 
with the United States' steps to unilaterally 
begin creating a missile defense system 
without replacing the ABM treaty with a 
new one. 

A new arms race is not the only prob-
lem that could stem from the plan that 
Bush has proposed. The missile defense 
system itself is not a sure thing. After all, 
there is still much research to do, research 
that needs a lot of money. Preliminary tri-
als done under Clinton's administration 
failed horribly, bringing in to question the 
likelihood that the United States will have 
any sort of missile defense. America 
should not take a big risk with a program 
·that has yet to prove itself. Bush expla,ned 
his plan to create a missile defense system; 

however, the exact 
details are yet to be 

marvel that has been the 
cornerstone of nuclear 
deterrence. The ABM treaty 
serves to ban almost any 
missile defense system 
between America and Rus-
sia. The theory behind this 
treaty is that by eliminating 
a defense system, a country

many possibilities -
air defense, sea 
defense and land 
defense - that remain 
undecided. . 

GIJARDIAN OPINION A large amount of 
money is needed to 

will not build many weapons and become 
"trigger-happy" with the confidence that 
by having a missile defense system, it 
could bomb aAY country and be safe. With 
Bush's plan to build a defense system and 
retract from the ABM treaty, a new arms 
race could begin. 

A new arms race could cause not only 
anger from Russia, but also many rising 
nuclear powers such as China and India. 
Russia is still dismantling nuclear devices, 
but scraping the ABM treaty may stop this 
process. Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan has 
admitted that he has "great concerns about 
a unilateral decision [to abandon the ABM 
treaty] because [he] beHeves that it could 
risk a second Cold War - Cold War II." Rus-

research a defense sys-
tem - an amount that our tight budget 
cannot provide. The task of opening up 
funds for the defense and also passing the 
large tax cut that Bush plans amounts to an 
impossible task. America cannot cut taxes 
and expect to spend a large portion of its 
limited resources on an experimental pro-
gram. So which does Bush want - the mil-
itary,or the tax cut? 

By funding this experimental program, 
Bush' is putting all his eggs in one basket, 
one that cannot solely protect the United 
States. Bush 's secretary of defense, Donald 
Rumsfeld, admitted that "we are more vul-

Faded 

CAROLINE SONG 

T his Mother's Day, I did not go home to see my mother. . I was too busy preparing 
for International House's Asian and 
Pacific Culture Night, which was 
held that Sunday evening. So, 
instead of going home bearing gifts 
for my mom like a good daughte,r, I 
invited my parents to attend Asian 
and Pacific Culture Night. That way, 
I got to see my mom, and she got to 
see me make a fool of myself 
onstage. 

My mother is my role model. 
Raising twO children is a daunting 
task for. anyone, but to do so in an 
unfamiliar country makes the task 
doubly difficult. Transplanting 
oneself from one's own country 
and immigrating to another with 
two young children is a true test of 
courage and strength . Yet my 
mother persevered, and .. . are you 
still reading? Have I lost you yet? 
Were you just about to turn the 
page to sej: if there were any good 
coupons in today's issue? 

Lately I have been asked why 
my articles have taken on such a 
negative tone (to put it tactfully). 
"Don't you have anything positive 
to say?" Why, yes, I have many pos-
itive things to say. The question is, 
do you care enough to read them? 

My mother is a very loving and 
admirable person, but do you really 
want to hear me wax poetic about 
her? My reasons for loving my mom 
are probably the same you have for 
loving your mom, so would I be 
imparting any new and interesting 
knowledge to you, or provoking you 
to come to any new and interesting 
thoughts? Probably not. 

How about an article titled 
"Ethnic Diversity Increasing in 
Hollywood"? I could talk about 
how, lately, there's been an increase 
in non-Caucasian actors in televi-
sion programs. I could praise the 
networks for being more sensitive 
to the need for ethnic diversity in 
the media and give suggestions on 
how to further portray race and 
gender relations in a positive light. 
This may interest a few people. but 
how many of you are affected by 
this in your day-to-day lives? 

While it is true that a good arti-
cle does not have to be one that 
addresses topics of everyday life, if 
it were my aim to discuss global, 
national or social issues, I would 
write the pro and con articles. 

The fact of the matter is, this is 
my column and I'll write about 
whatever I damn well please, within 
reason. But since I am being paid to 
write articles for the UCSD publics, 
it makes sense that I choose topics 
that I think will be of interest to oth-
ers, instead of using this space as my 
own personal diary. Therefore, I will 
spare you the ode to my mother and 
instead write about what I believe to 
be more interesting. 

That point brings me to the 
controversy. The last time I was in 
the Guardian office, I was told that 
two very angry people had to bite 
my head off. The guy probably had 
a goatee and the girl probably dyes 
her hair. Yes, I make controversial 
statements. Would you be reading 
this if I didn 't? Nobody reads the 
Guardian cover to cover, with the 
exception of the editor in chief 
and those whose lives must be so 
mundane that they have nothing 
better to do. People flip through

Global Warming Is a Hot Issue for Bush 
President Bush is placing the United States in an ackward position with refusal 
By CHRISTOPHER DRAPER 
Special to the Guardian 

• Global warming is one of the 
most serious environmental 
threats to our way of life. That 
may seem a bit ex~eme, but .it is 
true. Global warnung IS senous 
because we now have evidence 
that it has far-reaching conse-
quences. 

Last month , the United 
Nations' Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change found links 
between human activity, levels of 
greenhouse gases and global cli-
mate changes. 

Like it or not, global warming 
is good science and based on facts. 
The IPCC report has solid and 
incontrovertible evidence that 
human activity is affecting the 
global climate. Just how much the 
climate will change and how long 
it will take is still being' researched 
and debated. 

Any serious change in global 
temperatures will have disastrous 
repercussions. IPCC analysis indi-
cates that temperature increases 
will cause increased flooding 
along the West Coast, the Eastern 

seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexi-
co, There is already evidence, 
according to the IPCC, that aver-
age sea levels have increased by 
0.1 to 0.2 meters. 

Also, evidence from satellites 
has shown that air temperatures 
in the lower 8 kilometers of the 
atmosphere have increased, as 
well as overall global surface tem-
peratures. If this trend continu~s, 
the ecological impact can be dIS-
astrous. Marine life is especially 
sensitive to changes in water tem-
perature, and changes to the nat-
ural habitats across large areas of 
water can drive a species to extinc-
tion. Our very own Scripps Insti-
tution of Oceanography has 
found connections between 
human activity and increases in 
ocean temperature. 

Last month, President George 
W. Bush signaled that he would 
not regulate emissions of carbon 
dioxide and that the administra-
tion would not support the Kyoto 
Treaty. This signaled a storm of 
criticism from abroad, particularly 
from the European Union. It is 
embarrassing, if not disgraceful, 
that we as the American people 

comprise 4 percent of the world's 
population, yet we contribute 25 
percent of the pollution. It is irre-
sponsible if the admintstration, 
and of us as a nation to decline to 
take part and find a solution to a 
global problem, The most recent 
reports on the Bush administra-
tion 's energy policy do not offer 
any reasonable plan for taking on 
global warming or solving the cur-
rent energy crisis. Instead , the 
Bush plan promises to be a wind-
fall for coal, oil and nuclear ener-
gy companies. They are the very 
industries that contributed heavily 
to Bush's campaign. 

The Kyoto Treaty has its faul ts, 
but they could have been, and 
should have been, worked out in 
good faith . Bush's argument that 
carbon dioxide regulation is 
harmful to our economy is also 
shortsighted, The economic costs 
of pollution and global warming 
are much higher and longer-last-
ing then the short term costs of 
reforming and refitting our energy 
policy. In addition, there is serious 
economic profit in properly devel-
oping and implementing clean 
energies. 

There are workable solutions, 
The env ironmental man tra, 
"Think globally, act locally," could 
not be more true. In addition 10 
being the worst world polluter, the 
United States is also among the 
least efficient with the available 
resources, Vice PreSIdent Dick 
Cheney may th ink that conserva-
tion is nothing morc then a per-
sona l virtue. However, simple 
changes in how we LIse energy can 
have a great effect; not only in COSI 
but in pollution as well. . 

It is a lesson that we in Califo r-
nia learned the hard way, Keeping 
unneeded lights off and leaving the 
thermostat off at night will dt'crease 
the power needed and lower elec-
tricity bills. Replaci ng incandescent 
bulbs with fluorescent ones WIll be 
even better, Transportation is 
another source of pollution . Car-
pooling and using public trans-
portation will not only decrease 
pollution, but lower traffic and 
commuter times as well. 

The greatest opportunities we 
have to alleviate global wartnlllg 
are the development of alternative

Editor: 
At least one person in four will 

contract a sexually trans mitted 
infection at some point in his life. 

Eighty percent of women and 
40 percent of men infected with 
chlamydia have no symptoms. 

Withou t contracep ti on. the 
ave rage woman would become 
pregnant more than 12 times in 
her life. 

Over 3 million unintended 
pregnancies occur in the United 
States every year. 

Worldwide. a woman dies from 
pregnancy- related causes every 
minute. 

Should you care? If you or any-
one that you care about is sexually 
active, then you'd better care. 

Since 1995, the U.S. Congress 
has voted 116 times to restrict 
access to family planning, sex edu-
cation and the right to choose. If 
you have ever gone to a family 
planning clinic such as Planned 
Parenthood for prenatal care, gyne-
cological exams, birth control, 
emergency contraception or testing 
for sexually transmitted infections, 
then you, along with the vast 
majority of Americans, know how 
important reproductive health care 
can be. Yet politicians seem to be 
increasingly determined to deny us 
access to these services. 

VOX is a new UCSD student 
organization dedicated to speaking 
out for reproductive freedom. VOX 
is Latin for "voice," and we're here 
to make our voices heard on cam-
pus and in the Capitol. We are 
endorsed by Planned Parenthood, 
and we want to help students learn 
about reproductive rights so that 
all of us have the training and 
opportunities we need to make our 
voices heard by legislators. 

All people have the right to 
manage their own fertility. We are a 
pro-choice group that firmly 
believes that access to family plan-
ning services, responsible sexuality 
education and preventive health 
care reduces the numbers of unin-
tended pregnancies and abortions. 
We want access to reproductive 
health care and education to be 
available to everyone. 

Legislators make decisions that 
affect choices every day. It's time to 
remind our legislators that they

As Bush said, "We should

treaty with a new framework that 
reflects a clear and c1eal} break 
from the past and especially 
from the adversariallegacy of the 
Cold War: 

President Bush has shown 
that he is dedicated to his coun-

shown that the United States will 
not waver indecisively in the

By worrying about defense, 
Bush has strayed from the basis 
of American policy in dealing 
with possible threats to security. 
America's past security has been 
due to the civilized acts of diplo-

By drifting from this policy, 
many European nations have

All too often, politicians are 
forced into irrational positions by

also made an attempt to create a

Bush Gala Expected 
to Raise $15 Million 

WASHINGTON - Organizers 
of a multimillion-dollar Republican 
dinner that will be President Bush's 
debut as fund-raiser in chief include 
dozens of corporate lobbyists and 
executives who helped engineer ~is 
election and whose industries stand 
to benefit from his energy plan, his 
tax cuts and his other early moves in 
the White House. 

The black-tic dinner on 
Tuesday, the Republican ational 
Committee's Presidential Gala, is 
expected to raise more than $15 
million for the party and attract at 
least 2,000 people, including sever-
al Cabinet members and virtually 
all of the Republican leaders of 
Congress. Ticket prices begin at 

ists and executives from oil, gas 
and nuclear-energy companies 
that helped shape the White 
House energy plan, from manufac-
turing concerns delighted by 
Bush's early decision to overturn 
workplace ergonomic rules, frolP 
credit-card companies grateful for 
Bush 's support for a bill to make it 
harder for people to escape their 
debts in bankruptcy and from cig-
arette-makers encouraged by 
reports that the government may 
drop a $100 billion racketeering 
lawsuit against the industry. 

The leading nonenergy corporate

President Clinton, who was 
harshly criticized by Republicans 
for his aggressive fund raising, used 
similar Washington dinners to ra ise 
tens of millions of dollars for the 
Democratic Party. For groups seek-
ing changes in campaign law, the 
huge Democratic galas came to 
symbolize the excesses of so-called 
soft-money donations, the unlimit-

one solution. Growing your own 
produce might be another. Most 
often, the answer for people with-
out a local supermarket in their 
town is in making the trek to 
another town, in becoming com-
muter shoppers. 

With no store in town, many 
people in Blue Hill shop in 
Hastings, a bustling city 20 miles 
away, which rises like an oasis of 
Wal-Marts and glittering fast-food 
restaurants. Others buy groceries 
in Red Cloud, the county seat, and 
home to two supermarkets. 

Willems worries that without a 
grocery people will not want to move 
to Blue Hill, which, unlike other 
many towns in the region, grew in 
population over the last decade. 

As a result, the town has moved 
quickly to replace its supermarket. 
The Blue Hill Community 
Foundation, a local nonprofit orga-
nization , would construct a building 
with the help of a federal grant 
being sought by the city, then lease 
it to the Prices for 1 percent of gross 
sales of about $15,000 a week, or 
roughly $8,000 to $10,000 a year. 
The projected total cost to replace 
the store is $600,000 with the Prices 
paying an estimated $300,000 to 
restock as well as equip the store. 
The stOre is expected to reopen in 
September, the mayor says, with

long aisles, an in-store bakery,

Cardinals Meet at the Vatican 
to Decide on Church's Future 

ROME - The College of 
Cardinals will gather at the Vatican 
on Monday with the solemn task 
of sorting out the challenges facing 
the Roman Catholic Church in the 
third millennium. 

But as they sit in the Apostolic 
Palace, not far from the Sistine 
Chapel where princes of the 
church elect a new pope, the car-
dinals will also be a little like char-
acters summoned at the end of an 
Agatha Christie mystery, looking 
around the room and and won-
dering, "Which one of us is it?" 

The four-day consistory, a 
meeting that Vatican watchers are 
studying as a "pre-conclave: gives 

. the pope's advisers a unique 
opportunity to campaign among 
their peers. 

"Every time one of them gets 
up to speak, the other cardinals 
will be asking themselves, 'What 
kind of pope would this guy 
make?'" said the Rev. Thomas j. 
Reese, an American Jesuit who 
wrote "Inside the Vatican: The 
Politics and Organization of the 
Catholic Church." 

Speculation about who will 
someday take the place of John 

Paul II, who turned 81 on Friday, 
has been a Vatican parlor game for 
more than a decade, long enough 
for some early favorites to have 
died. But the consistory, the first 
such gathering of cardinals since 
1994, brings together all 134 men 
who are under 80 and eligible to 
vote in a papal conclave, as well as 
all non-electors, or at least those 
healthy enough to travel. Last 
February, the pope named 44 new 
cardinals, packing the total to 183, 
the largest and most diverse col-
lege in history. 

A silent contest among papal 
contenders has gone on for years, 
of course. Outright campaigning 
is taboo, but there are other dis-
creet ways for cardinals to polish 
their credentials, from foreign 
trips and carefully timbered public 
statements to favoring a colleague 
with fund-raising help or serving 
Mass in a local church. 

The extraordinary consistory, 
the sixth of this papacy, was called 
by the pope to discuss the apos-
tolic letter in which he raised 
some key concerns for the future, 
from ecumenical understanding 
to ways to broaden consultation 

within the Roman Catholic 
Church, a sensitive topic inside 
the church hierarchy. 

But the meeting has a broad 
agenda, and its closed-door set-
ting allows cardinals to speak their 
minds - and also form the minds 
of their fellow electors. 

John Paul, whose 23-year 
tenure is the longest of the last 
100 years, has put his indelible 
stamp on the church and on the 
College of Cardinals, where he has 
selected all but 11 of the 134 men 
eligible to vote in a conclave. 

This pope has cracked down 
hard on theologians who stray 
from strict orthodoxy, and he has 
made conservative rulings on 
social issues, from birth control 
to women's ordination. Most of 
the cardinals, handpicked by 
John Paul II, share his views, but 
others have hinted that there is 
room for more discussion in the 
future, leaving an opening for a 
moderate candidate who could 
appeal to liberals without 
affronting conservatives.

Bullies: Why Push Comes to Shove 
INDIANA - Lately, everybody 

is ganging up on bullies, blaming 
them for all that ails us. But experts 
in aggressive behavior warn that 
there is no easy way to stamp out 
bullying among children. Bullying 
behaviors, they say, can never be 
eliminated entirely from the sus-
tained hazing ritual otherwise 
known as growing up. 

Dr. Frans de Waal, a primatolo-
gist at Emory University, says that 
one of the problems in the stan-
dard approach to bully analysis is 
that researchers tend to ignore the 
subtle dynamics between a bully 
and the object of a bully's scorn -
the scapegoat. "Some individuals 
may have bully characteristics, and 
others may have scapegoat char-
acteristics," he said. "The two 
things need to be studied togeth-
er, but because personality 
research is generally done from an 
individual perspective, they rarely 
are." 

Latvia: 
Natives see the Russian 
troops as invaders 
ContInued .from ,.,. 1 
related to World War II in general." 

And in Latvia, almost every-
thing is related in one way or 
another to World War II. 

More than a third of the coun-
try's 2.4 million people are Russian, 
many of them offspring of Soviet 
troops who took control of Latvia 
in 1940. Most of the remaining 
two-thirds are native Latvians who 
often as not are descended from the 
fathers and grandfathers who 
waged guerrilla war against those 
same Soviet troops. 

Native Latvians tend to see the 
Soviet troops as invaders and the 
Latvian resistance as freedom 
fighters. Russian Latvians tend to 
see their military forebears as 
Latvia's saviors from Nazi rule and 
the native Latvians who resisted 

Bully experts admit that children 
in groups will often encourage, or at 
least not discourage, a bully's nasty 
acts against an underling. 

In one study of how peers con-
tribute to bullying, researchers 
from York University studied 
videotapes of 53 episodes of bully-
ing among elementary school stu-
dents. They found that 54 percent 
of the time, onlookers stood by 
passively as the bully picked on 
the victim, an inactive form of 
activity that the researchers said 
ended up reinforcing the bully's 
behavior. And 21 percent of the 
time, some of the onlookers 
joined in on the taunting. Only in 
25 percent of the cases did a child 
attempt to step in and help the 
victim or call a teacher. 

Researchers have lately discov-
ered that many bullies in fact are 
quite popular. "Some kids may be 
goaders, cheering the bully on 
because they want to be accept-

them as Nazi collaborators. 
That isn't saying the two 

groups don't get along. By and 
farge, they do. Sixty years . of 
cohabitation have worn away the 
relationship'S sharp edges. A 
decade of independence has made 
them Latvians first and ethnic 
Latvians a distant second. 

But the opposing views of histo-
ry are never far from the surface. 
Consider, for example, the events of 
May, the 56th anniversary of 
Germany's capitulation to the Allies. 

In Riga, tens of thousands of 
Latvian Russians marked Victory 
Day by marching to a military 
cemetery and heaping carnations 
on the graves of Soviet soldiers. 

Native Latvians went to work 
as usual. They saw no cause to 
celebrate. "For us, in our view, 
when the war ended in Europe, it 
didn't end in Latvia - we were 
occupied," said Ojars Kalnins, a 
former Latvian ambassador to 
Washington who directs the gov-
ernment-financed information 

ed: said Dr. Laura Hess Olson, an 
assistant professor of child devel-
opment at Purdue University. ·Or 
they may just stand by and do 
nothing because they're afraid 
they might be targeted next." She 
added, "We have to realize that 
everybody is a player in creating 
the atmosphere in which bullying 
occurs." 

Olson also noted that the 
stereotype of the bully as an antiso-
cial and unpopular misfit is false. In 
one study of third- to fifth-graders 
in two East Coast schools, she and 
her colleagues found that, while 
the students described by their 
peers and teachers as friendly, out-
going and self-confident were the 
most popular, the boys known to 
be bullies were the second-most 
popular group, way beyond the 
perceived wimps, eggheads and 
teacher's pets. .

institute. "In our view, World War 
II ended in 1991 when we finally 
restored our independence." 

Today, some Russian Latvians 
complain of subtle discrimination: 
difficulty being hired and onerous 
language laws. 

They are outraged by the gov-
ernment's recent prosecutions of 
a former Russian soldier and 
security officials - including 
Latvians - as war criminals. 

They see malice in Latvia's deci-
sion shortly after becoming inde-
pendent to deny citizenship to out-
siders who settled here after 1940 
- that is, after the Soviet takeover. 

And they resent the fact that 
officials took six more years after 
that to draft workable rules for their 
naturalization. So more than half 
remain legal aliens, ex-citizens of a 
nonexistent Soviet empire who 
have no vote or say in a govern-
ment dominated by native Latvians.

ing paintball bullets, it shoots tear 
gas, Smith said. 

In combination with the tear gas, 
the police could also add dye that 
would enable police to see a mark on 
a person under ultraviolet light. 

"[The weapon] is apparently 
designed to inflict pain and mark 
random persons in a large crowd. It 
also appears extremely dangerous," 
said Ron Meyers, president of the 
Council of Graduate Students. 
"Paintball guns arc for recreation 
with the proper equipment, and not 
for the police to mark students:' 

Sgt. Dana Winship of th e 
Columbus police said the gun is 
the same size as a regular paint-
ball gun and is smaller than a 
shotgun. Mosr other guns, such 
as the rubber bullet gun, are big-
ger than a shotgun. The diameter 
of the barrel is the size of a dime. 
while the barrel of the rubber bul-
let gun is a little bigger than a sil-
ver dollar. Winship said other 
guns are cum bersome. 

"[The new gun] is pretty 
handy," Smith said. 

Winship said the gun uses low-
end technology and is cheaper than 
other guns used by police. It costs 
about $400, whereas other guns 
can cost up to $1 ,000. 

"This is the only weapon of its 
kind that I'm aware of: Winship 
said. 

So far, police have only tested 
the gun and have not used it in the 
field. Smith said the gun can h~lp 
in crowd control problems, whICh 
the police face on a regular basis. 

The gun is not lethal. It is also 
different from the rubber bullet 
gun because it is the only gun of its 
kind that lets police target an indi-
vidual in a crowd. 

In the recent off-campus riots, 
the police used rubber bullets; 
police may use this new gun in 
similar situations, Smith said. 

The police do not have restric-
tions regarding the use of the gun, 
Smith said. 

Anybody can buy this type of 
gun, Smith said, referring to regular 
paintball guns, though he added that 
the general public may not use the 
kind of ammunition that police use.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Dinll1g 
service workcrs ratificd a new (on-
tract wi th Harvard University 
Thursday night that will raise the 
wages of all workers. as well as 
ensuring that no worker employed 
fo r more than on~ year will earn less 
than $10.25 an hour - th ... ligure 
set as Cambridgc·s ··Iiving wage." 

The agreement came aflt:r a 
week of contentiolls ncgotiations 
between th ... univl'rsity ,Ind thl' 
Local 26 of the Hotel Employees 
and Restaurant Employecs 
International Union. Union lead-
ers had agr ...... d to strike if an 
agreement was not reached by 
Wednesday. 

Union officials call tht: !lCW 
contract the biggest cconomic g,lin 
for employees in the history of 
Local 26. Ninety-dght percelll l)f 
union members at thc mt"cling 
voted to accept the agrccI1ll'nt. 

"I think it was a great vielOl)' for 
the workers:' said Local :!6 
President Janice LOllx . 

The new contract r"isl's wages 
for the two tiers of ... mployces thal 
make up Harvard University 
Dining Services - the lowcr-p,lid 
"cash operations·' workers who 
serve at campus restaurants, and 
the '"board operations" members 
who serve in dining halls. For 
board operations, the increase will 
be $2.05 per hour across the 
board. 

Under the contract. Harvard 
also agreed to a 10 percent cap on 
the number of hours worked b)' 
"casuals" - temporary employees 
who do not receive fringe benefi ts. 

The reduction of casual 
employees was cited by workers as 
crucial to their job securi ty during 
negotiations. 

There were a number of new 
clauses in the contract to strength-
en the union. The new contract 
allows for up to four employees to 
take a one-year leave of absence 10 
work for Local 26, for workers 10 
wear designated union buttons on 
their uniforms, and for union dues 
authorization cards 10 be included 
in the orientation cards of new

This Year 'Has Had Many 
Enriching Experiences that 
Will Last a Lifetime· 

CR.O\S\XORJ) 

TheEd itor 'sSoopbox 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Features Editor 

Well. here it is: my last Editor's 
Soapbox as the features editor of 
th.: GuardiaTl. I'd like to take this 
oppol1unity to reflect on this year 
at UCS D. 

In retrospect, this has been a 
solid sophomore year for me that 
followed an enviable rreshman 
run. The year has had its ups and 
dOWIlS, bClI has made me a better 
persoll overall. (I know this 
sounds really sappy, but allow me 
to get nostalgic and mushy for a 
few lines.) 

Coming into this year, I hon-
estly didn 't know what to expect. I 
was living with three other guys in 
an on-campus apartment. For the 
first time in my life, I was one of 
the people in charge of maintain-
ing a domicile, including cooking 
and cleaning. That in itself has 
brought about some interesting 
si tuations. 

is the best deal can be quite amus-
ing to passers-by. We even put a 
few old ladies to shame with the 
amount of coupons that we had 
shamelessly pilfered from another 
student's Sunday newspaper. 

As I began to settle into my 
apartment, I also had to settle into 
my classes. After breezing through 
my freshman year with mmimal 
studying, I was rudely awakened 
by the hell that is upper-division 
classes. Entering my sophomore 
year, I had yet to take an upper-
division class. I simply figured that 
they would be a little more in-
depth, but just as easy. Wow, was I 
in for a treat. 

For literally the first time in my 
life, I found myself forced to actu-
ally study. It was quite a foreign 
concept to me. I tried to study in 
my room a few times, but that just 
led to embarrassing grades on 
midterms that clued me in to the 
fact that I needed an alternative 
ambiance for studying. That is 
when I found the place that would 
become my Mecca for the rest of 
the year: Denny's. 

more classes (I was up to an hour 
or so of studying per week) , I 
found that I needed to find a 
social outlet or two for my deep 
love of women, alcohol and cheap 
adrenaline rushes. 

I found parties at UCSD to be 
exactly what they were my fresh-
man year: few and far between. 
The good parties cost money and 
were usually broken up just 
when they really got rolling. I did 
notice that the student body 
seemed to make a more concert-
ed effort to have fun this year, 
but not nearly enough. I still 
contend that we should party 
like it 's Sun God once a week, 
even though it would probably 
kill some of us. 

While I'm on the social scene, I 
have to take a moment to write a 
little something about the ladie~ 
here at UCSD. Before my fresh-
man year, I basically heard one 
word to describe the women of 
UCSD: unamactive.

I remember that after I had 
been in the apartment for just two 
days, our refrigerator contained 
only two things: pizza and beer. I 
happen to think that that situa-
tion reflected posi tively on the 
residents of the apartment, but 
my roomma tes thought other-
wise. 

What other 24-hour, white-
trash haven caters to poor college 
students looking to further their 
academic enrichment? one, I 
say. Denny's is a great place to go 
and get some serious work done. 
You can get your grub on and 
pound endless cups of coffee 
while learning the area of three-
dimensional objects being spun 
around the x-axis. 

. When I got to campus last 
year, I'll admit, I didn't see it as 
having a gorgeous student body. 
I'm not saying that everyone here 
was Elephant-man ugly, but they 
were attractive ly challenged. 
However, since I have been at 
UCSD, I have noticed a fantastic 
trend in the girls of the second-
and first-year classes this year: 
they are hot. This year's fresh-
man and sophomore girls are 
very attractive. I've even noticed 
quite a few upper-class girls who

Bearing Questions: Advice 
on Current Issues 
By ZOPYRYA 
Speacial to the Guardian 

Good fellows, I greet you during 
the continuance of this great 
experiment. For the remainder of 
the quarter, I will attempt to pro-
vide you with spiritual and divine 
guidance, drawn not from the stars, 
but from the ancient Chinese 
Oracle, the I-Ching. I undertake 
this endeavor with the humblest 
reverence for Fu Hsi, the origina-
tor, respect for all the interpreters 
after him and with sincerest hopes 
that my labors may be of benefit to 
you. 

If you wish to delve further into 
the Oracle than I am able to here, 
there are several good volumes 
avai lable at Geisel and numerous 
online resources. Feel free to con-
tact me at zopyra@zensearch.net for 
guidance, or with any question I 
can ask of the Oracle for you. 

For the eighth week of the 
UCSD spring quarter, beginning 
Monday, May 21, I will continue 
last week's inquiry and explore one 
more. 

You asked me: Dear Zopyra, 
every time spring rolls around, I get 
very nervous about my housing sit-
uation. On top of finishing this 
school year, I have to find a place to 
live for the next. What can I do? 

I asked the Oracle: "What is the 
best course of action to secure 
housing in the San Diego Area for 
next year?" 

In response, I received 
Hexagram 8, the Kua of Holding 
Together, with an old broken line 
in the first and second place, both 
of which will soon become solid 

and produce Hexagram 60, the Kua 
of Setting Limitations. 

This immediately identifies the 
topic of the inquiry as deserving of 
careful and conscientious atten -
tion. Not only has the Oracle pro-
vided a detailed response, it has 
begun with a judgment that 
strongly urges active self-examina-
tion. 

Entering into group housing 
will be highly fortuitous this year 
for those who do so with great care 
and caution. Danger comes not 
from duplicity on the part of 
potential housemates or landlords, 
but from within . If you arrange 
group housing with any devious or 
hidden motives, great misfortune 
will befall you. 

As ever, the I-Ching Oracle 
provides guidance for the present 
moment. As with any book of wis-
dom, it is filled with excellent life 
lessons, blll the literal meaning of 
the Chinese title, "The Book of 
Changes," indicates that th e 
Oracle works by revealing th e 
most vital of its lessons and wis-
dom for the context of the partic-
ular moment in which we inquire 
of it. In this case, the Oracle paints 
a picture of a group of people just 
beginning to gather around a 
leader and predicts good fortune 
to come. 

If you can gladly join a group in 
pursuing housing for next year, do 
so with haste. Make yourself an 
ally of the group leader in the 
argumentat ive process of finding 
housing by knowing yourself and 
your limits well. Communica te

14 FEATURES The UCSD Guardian Monday, May 21 , 2001 

Soapbox: 
The year has had many 
lessons to learn from 
Continued from page 12 
are looki ng pretty good as well. In 
all, I think that the stereotype of 
UCSD women as generally being 
ugly is completely outdated . I 
think that a simple stro I down 
Librar, 'vValk around noon wtll 
show ihat. 

Another pan of my social out-
le t was ta ' ing am'antage of the 
ti ne :'\ative merican ga ming 
establishments tnat are ocated so 
convemently close to campus. In 
particular, I gambled at Viejas 
quite a bit (they should give me a 
share of the casino for all the 
money I've dropped there). There 
IS no~hll1g bener than ran.domly 
deCldll1g to take a mlol11ght stroll 
up to see Dale lovingly pro-
nOl l1l:eo . Dah- ay"), Bong, 

lalach l and the other wacky deal-
as that are so eager to take your 
rnone\'. 

WIth so many other things 
gOll1g on 111 my life, it s amazing 
thdt I was actually able to hold a 
JO b. As the year 'began , I also had to 
senle IntO my new posmon as fea-
tures editor at the Guardzan. I'd 
\\orked at he paper my freshman 
year but honest \. didn 't know what 
It took to run a secllon of the paper 
.)n my own . Suddenly I was 
responsible for a tu il quaner of the 
paper's output. ~.tv name was on it, 
so if it looked li ke ass, I was to 
blame. It was a lot 01 pressure early 
in the year, but I would like to think 
that I adjustca mcely and did a nice 
Job with the ,CClIon (l guess that 
you readers are the tinal judges of 
that) . 

wanted the readers to realize that 
there was more to the features sec-
tion than simply the crossword 
puzzle (which, despite my efforts, 
remains the most popular part of 
the section) . In the end, I hope that 
I've made it a more enjoyable expe-
rience for you guys. Who knows, 
you might have even learned a 
thing or two from the articles that 
we've run. In any case, feel free to 
e-mail me at jcrouse@ucsd.edu with 
any feedback that you have. I'd be 
interested to hear what you have to 
say. 

As far as next year is con-
cerned, I don't know what my 
place in the paper is gOll1g to be. I 
don 't know what my place in th is 
school is goi ng to be, for that mat-
ter. 

My second year at UCS D has 
been completely unforge ttable. 
I've met so many amazing people 
and had so many more II1credible 
experiences that have made a per-
manent impact on my life that r 
can hardly believe it. I've heard 
tha t these are the best years of my 
life. Reflecting on that statement, I 
wouldn 't mll1d it all too much . I 
feel that these years have been 
good to me. I can only hope that 
the next twO years here Will be as 
good as the ·first. One can only 
hope.

BookReview 
• yTOMW 
Senior Staff Writer 

From time to time, we have all 
asked, "Who am 17" in a desperate 
search for identity, both in tenns 
of cultural makeup and personali-
ty. In a world where national bar-

rie~ are quickly falling down, 
globalization is picking up 
momentum and marriage between 
peopl.e of different ethnicities is on 
the rise, another question some 
people may ask is, "What am I?" 

Poet and writer Paisley RekdaJ 
addresses these questions in her 
book., "The Night My Mother Met 
Bruce Lee." A nonfiction work 
about Rekdal 's own experiences, 
the book examines how a person 
of mixed heritage is viewed 
through the eyes of native 
Chinese, Koreans and Japanese 
people. Rekdal herself is mixed; 

..her mother is Chinese-American 
while ,her father is Norwegian. 
However, she looks almost entire-
ly white. Rekdal's duality is set 
against the duality with which she 
examines her own identity: the 
micro sense of self-analysis and 
the macro sense of how the world 
views her. 

Rekdal humorously writes on 
her travels in China, Korea, Japan 
and the Philippines and critically 
explores how people in each , 
nation view her. At the end of the 
book, she comes to a concl usion 
about ethnicity, about who she is, 
what she is, and likewise helps us 
come to our own conclusion. 
What is most memorable for me is 
that Rekdal does so through a 

The UCSD Guardian 

An Encounter ·Leads to 
Personal Awareness 
A different take on Asian identities 

compassionate and humorous 
lens, setting her book apart from 
other, drier, critical ethnic studies 
literature. She unabashedly retells 
anecdotes, whether embarrassing 
or personal. But because of this, 
the reader's attention is captured 
and keeps him reading, even if the 
book is used in an Asian ethnic 
studies course or an Asian-
American literature course. 

The book s'tarts off with what 
the title implies: the night Rekdal's 
mother met Bruce Lee. Rer moth-
er, still a teen-ager at the time, was 
working in a restaurant. While the 
introduction goes on and 
describes the situation in which 
her mother met Lee (I'm going to 
skip it and let you laugh about it 
yourselt). 

The story humorously contin-
ues with Rekdal's experiences liv-
ing in China with a group of 'for-
eign students. It also talks about 
her hearing what they think about 
Asians, living with a conservative 
Japanese family, teaching English 
in South Korea, her travels in the 
Philippines and even in her own 
bedroom. Again , the narrative 
shifts back and forth between her 
own developing views on her 
identity and how the world views 
her. Readers are given the chance 
to witness how she comes to her 
resolution on identities and how 
she comes to terms with herself. 

I am purposefully holding back 
on much of the detailed descrip-
tions of "The Night My Mother 
Met Bruce [;ee." Moreso than with 
other books, to even hint at what 
transpires in this book is to give 

away the meaning of it: how to 
view oneself. While Rekdal does 
come to a conclusion on who and 
what she is, the book must be read 
on a personalleve1 and the reader 
must come to his own cOnclu-
sions. In essence, it is a book that 
.must be enjoyed selfishly. 

I would highly recommend this 
book to anyone interested in 
Asian-American literature and 
ethnic studies. It takes a different 
approach to exploring Asian iden-
tities and ethnic identity, filled 
with smiles and laughter. "The 
Night My Mother Met Bruce Lee" 
will keep the reader interested, yet 
still provide the critical analyses 
that are found in similar literature. 

Buried beneath the humor and 
embarrassing moments are the 
opinions expressed in many Asian 
ethnic studies courses on racial and 
ethnic identities. "Perhaps I am 

, afraid to become as my appearance 
suggests - 'merely white' -
because then I have nothing to dis-
tinguish myself." she writes, looking 
at her own identification as white 
and what it means to be white in 
relation to other races. If you're an 
ethnic studies major, you know 
exactly what she is refening to. 

"The Night My Mother Met 
Bruce Lee" is a fantastic book that 
critically examines race and iden-
tity in the 21 st centuty, where 
people of mixed heritage are more 
and more common. It looks at the 
same old beliefs of racial analysis 
through the lens of humor and 
anecdotes, leaving the reader with 
a smile on his face, while nodding 
his head in understanding."

clearly and then allow the situa-
tion and the group to work things 
out . 

This last instruction is drawn 
from the second half of the judg-
ment, Hexagram 60, or Setting 
Limitations. The groups that will 
prevail in the search for good 
housing in San Diego will be 
those with leadership. This is not 
a good year for unbalanced 
households, for excesses of drink-

FEATURES 15 

but rather the arrival of a poten-
tially devastating temptation. This 
may be the slothful desire to avoid 
work by dropping a class. Or, if 
you took on extra classes for pride 
or other unhealthy motivations, 
this earlier unbalanced decision 
may be coming back to haunt 
you. 

Which part of you wants to 
drop and which pan wants to per-
severe? Have you asked others for 
advice? Some of these motives and 
some of these people are strong 
and some of these are weak. You 
must decide which is which . It may 
take strength to finish the course, 
or strength might be required to 
admit that you are overburdened. If

leader who can 
provide balance 
and moderation 
among the group 
will reap great 
rewards for herself 
and all those 
around her.

decision: It must

The Oracle cannot tell you what 
to do, only how a certain thing may 
be done and what to expect from 
doing it. 

I asked: "How should students 
decide whether to drop a class and 
receive a 'W'?" 

I received another complex 
response, this time Hexagram 44, 
Meeting with old solid lines in the 
second and fifth places, which will 
both soon become broken, pro-
ducing Hexagram 56, The Traveler. 
As you might suspect, the empha-
sis of this judgment is on logistical 
details of who and when, much 
more than why. 

The first Hexagram, Meeting, 
can also be called The Return of 
The Dark Force, and does not 
describe a gathering or summit, 

The Traveler, points ou t that 
whether you drop or persevere, 
you must move from your current 
moment of indecision to one of 
resolve. 

If you follow the path of 
strength, this movement will bring 
you face to face with difficulty. You 
are like the judge arranging pun-
ishment for the criminal. A 
prompt decision may be wise or 
foolish; a firm decision may be 
harsh or lenient. But delay and 
facilitating back and forth is 
always cruel. Do not spend the 
next few weeks torturing yourself 
with this decision . Identify the 
weak or evil inclination; have faith 
that you are strong enough to 
contest it and do so.

going to be doing something 
about the rape charge. with a sus-
pension and a fine of around 
$100,000. I think Patterson will be 
back in the lineup again, and I 
don't mean a team's starting line-
up. He has been charged with 
assault and attempted rape. He 
has gotten a slap on the wrist. He 
will soon return to his NBA 
lifestyle, making millions of dol-
lars, doing what he feels like. 

This is just another example of 
athletes committing a crime and 
getting off easy. Can anyone out 
there say "Ray Lewis' or "Mark 
Chmura'? 

People should just leave Toron-
to Raptors star Vince Carter alone. 
I am glad that he is graduating 
from the University of North Car-
olina. Let him go to the ceremony. 
Sure, the same day he has a big 
game, a game seven in the NBA 
playoffs be exact. That is his job 
and he should take responsibility 
for it. 

But guys, there is just a little 
bit more to life than basketball. 
Carter has no practical reason to 
graduate. He is set for life. He will 
never have to work another 

Bball: 
Players stepped up at the 
Division II level 
ContInued from Pag. 19 

Ruvald was a scoring machine 
and could be found contributing in 
almost every imaginable category. 
She led the team in scoring her 
senior year, averaging 11 .2 points a 
game. She also ' averaged 6.3 
rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.4 steals. 

"She was a top 10 player in every 

minute, ever. Yet he still wants to 
get that degree. The NBA and all 
of those announcers on NBC 
should be applauding this. They 
should be stressing the impor-
tance of receiving an education, 
and highlighting that even some-
one like superstar Vince Carter, a 
role model to millions of kids, 
wants to get a degree. 

The Padres scored 20 
runs the other night 
against the Montreal 
Expos. Twenty runs! 
That's more than the 
Chargers scored on more 
than a few occasions last 
year: . You know, when 
compared as a whole to 
the entire National 
League, the Pads aren't 
all that bad. 

Plus, the graduation actlvltles 
will in no' way interfere with the 
game. Carter is having his cake and 
eating it, too. Let him be. 

Looks like Monty Montezuma 
as we know him is dead. Down the 
freeway over at San Diego . State, 
they have decided to keep the 

category: Malone said. "She 
brought a lot of things to the table." 

Ruvald was more than just a 
big-time player on the court, she 
was also a big-time participant on 
campus. 

"She got the most out of col-
lege,' Malone said "She got into a 
lot of different things that con-
tributed to UCSD." 

The three were recruited as 
Division III players but were then 
thrusted into the Division II spot-
light this year. All three tumed their 
mad skills up a notch .

Aztecs as their mascot but are 
choosing to get rid of Monty Mon-
tezuma. 

I agree with this. Yes, keep the 
Aztec mascot. It does not mock the 
great indigenous people of Mexico. 
It may even honor them. The 
Aztecs are supposed to be strong, 
brave, powerful and intelligent peo-
ple. That is a pretty good example 
to go by - much better than a 
Banana Slug or a color or a tree. 

But State's Monty Montezuma 
is embarrassing. The guy runs all 
around the field whooping it up 
with a flaming spear. I mean, it is 
kind of cool, but it's still insulting. 
And the logo is menacing, but it is 
a picture of a scary, red face - also 
not right. The powers at State have 
made a decent decision. 

The Padres scored 20 runs the 
other night against the Montreal 
Expos. Twenty runs! That's more 
than the Chargers scored on more 
than a few occasions last year. You 
know, when compared as a whole 
to the entire National League, the 
Pads aren't all that bad. 

There are some good teams 
around, but none that are great, or 
that are unbeatable. The team is 
only two games out of first place in 
the West Division, the same divi-
sion that boasts Randy Johnson, 
Curt Schillin-&, Kevin Brown, Mike 
Hampton, Todd Helton, Gary She-
field, Barry Bonds and others. The 
Pads can hang. 

"Actually, I'm glad they got to 
play Division II," Malone said. "I 
think they had a great showing. 
There is not much of a difference, 
except for quickness and strength. 
They adjusted quite well." 

Every year players come and go; 
Kokjohn, Neal and Ruvald are the 
special breed that won't be forgot-
ten. 

·We're definitely going to miss 
them: Malone said. "They brought 
a lot of leadership to the team. They 
will be hard to replace. We will wish 
we had all three of them back."

they were due to the massive 
amounts of wounded soldiers 
they left behind. But these kooks 
soon cleared out and we were able 
to drink our two-dollar breakfast 
special gin and tonics and shoot a 
round of pool or two with the 
locals. 

Once we were able to extricate 
ourselves from the Owl's clutches, 
we headed for some grub to help 
us clear our cloudy domes. Once 
we got some sustenance down, it 
was time to somehow find our 
way to good 01' UCSD. 

Luckily, we were in the pres-
ence of Ms. C-Deezy, who had the 
whole bus schedule mapped out 
and calculated. We loaded up with 
drafts and hopped on the trusty 
34 northbound bus. 

The bus driver shot us a 
mean-spirited glare, perhaps 
because Madden was rolling with 
a twelver of Busch Beer in his 
hand and a bumping ghetto 
blaster on his shoulder. Eventu-

- ally we arrived at UCSD and got 
dow!) to business. 

Drafts were drained, cocktails 
were mixed and Jell-O shots were 
gulped. Before I knew it, I was 
wandering library walk in a full-
sized lobster outfit, distributing 
Neil Dennis composite pictures to 
the bewildered Triton student 
body. 

[t was probably one of the 
more hilarious things that I have 
ever experienced, as many of our 
fellow students recoiled in horror 

at the idea of a drunken crus-
tacean handing them pictures of 
some mulleted madman. 

Many hours of booze, drugs 
and cigarettes later, it was all over 
and alf was nice and all was good 
- except for the fact that a 
member of our crew was inex-
plicably lost and very clueless 
about the layout of the UCSD 
campus, because he had never 
been here before. So we wrote 
him off as detoxed, or passed out 

Drafts were drained, 
cocktails were mixed and 
Jell-O shots were gulped. 
Before I knew it, I was 
wandering library walk 
in a full-sized lobster 
outfit, distributing Neil 
Dennis composite

Triton student body: 
in a thorny bush, or wandering 
the canyons with Spanky, the 
drug-addicted hobo who has an 
affinity for young college boys. 
But he turned up back at the 
Cage eventually, none the worse 
for wear. 

But the weekend was not yet 
over. Not by a long shot, as it 
turned out. I was awakened from 
my much-needed slumber and 
sum moned to an undisclosed 
location for the annual Guardian 
vs. Koala drunken slosh ball fest-o-
rama. I had missed the annual 
showdown last year, having woken 
up at the crack of 5 p.m. So this 

The UCSD Guardian 

year it was on. I still managed to 
show up a couple of hours late. 
and I arrived to see a slew of 
rowdy, intoxicated journalistic 
professionals engaged in a fierce 
match-up. 

Many beers (and even more 
brawls) later. the game was com-
ing to a close, and it was promis-
ing to do so in dramatic fashion. 
Former sports scribe Billy B had 
stepped up to the mic a few 
moments later to settle a dispute 
old-school style - with a mano-
a-mano drink-off. The poor Koala 
kid never knew what hit him, as 
Bill pounded his two cups of suds 
before the other dude could even 
finish one. 

So the table was set. The 
Guardian faithful stood eagerly 
poised on the sidelines as the 
Lobsterman stepped to the plate, 
down two runs, but with two play-
ers chillin' on second, sloshball 
style. 

The Mighty Lobsterman took 
a swig from his trusty, ice-cold 
draft and stepped up to the plate. 
A pitch wa thrown, and with a 
resounding thwack, the ball went 
sailing toward the right field fence. 
Both runners came in, knotting 
the score. Then our favorite junior 
sports playa, Mr. Isaac "The Stick" 
Pearlman, stepped into the bat-
ter's box, took his stance and pro-
ceeded to smack a ball into center 
field that sent the Lobsterman 
racing ·home with the winning 
run. 

Dropping a shoulder to knock 
out a raucous loudmouth who 
was blocking the plate, the Lob-
sterman touched home, and that 
was that. Guardian wins, Guardian 
wins, oh my goodness Guardian 
Wins. Word.

out a decent three runs before the 
heavily inebriated Guardian fielders 
could get three outs. 

Before the Guardian could go to 
bat to try to beat that performance. 
however, both teams gathered 
around the cooler at second base as 
each team sent its best representa-
tive to a drink ing contest.

Burger soundly beat the Koala 's 
representative, easily downing twO 
beers before his opponent could 
finish one. 

The Koala then took the field 
bare-chested as the Guardian 
scored three runs in the space of 
two outs. tying up the game at 29 
apiece. Pearlman once again 
stepped up to the plate with a run-
ner on second, drove a double 11110 
left field, ending the game as the 
Guardian's last runner brought the 
final score to 30-29.

times in her UCSD career, Neal

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

t has happened again - yet I another case of an athlete being let off easy because of his stardom. This time I am talking 
about the Seattle Super Sonies' 
Ruben Patterson. Patterson was 
accused of artempted rape by his 
family's nanny. He gave some sort 
of modified plea, essentially mean-
Ing he Will spend 15 days In jail out 
of a one-year sentence. 

Fifteen days for attempted rape. 
I guess hiS crying in the court-

room helped him out. Why did he 
not say, "Not Guilty, your honor"? 
He says he did th is modified plea 
because he believed that a jury 
would convict him. Aren't junes ' 
supposed to convict those who are 
guIlty? Was the eVidence against 
him so strong that the prosecution 
would garner a guIlty verdict? If the 
eVidence was that overwhelming, 
then maybe he was gui lty, huh? 

Pa tcrson did admit to cheating 
on hiS Wife, but nothing more. 

This is not the first time that 
Patterson has gotten into some 
serious trouble. In February he was 
convicted of assau lt. The accusa, 
tion of rape was not his first brush 
with the law.

Dateline: Pacific Beach, Sun God Morning. The time IS 6:59 and 59 seconds and 
all is quiet. The clock's dastardly 
second hand has other things on 
its mind, however, and lurches for-
ward a tick, sending the hellish 
sounds of my alarm clock careen-

I groggily come to, and in my 
thoroughly pickled state it takes all

Saying Goodbye to Three 
Women's Basl{etball Stars 
Kokjohn, Neal and Ruvald are hanging their blues 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The basketball court and 
women's locker room at RIMAC 
Arena will be a little quieter and a 
little less filled with talent now 
that three of UCSD's top 
women's basketball players are 
graduating. 

This June, Triton stars Ashley 
Kokjohn, Kim Neal and 
Genevieve Ruvald will all be 
moving along in life, moving on 
to the next big thing. 

All three will be leaving a lot 
behind here in La Jolla. 

Kokjohn brought hard work 
and defense to the court. She was 
a rebounding machine. If a shot 
was missed, she would always be 
in position to scoop up the 

board, averaging almost nine per 
game her senior season. 

"She's very tenacious," said 
women's basketball head coach 
Judy Malone. "She goes after the 
boards. This year she played 
against players much bigger Md 
taller. She finished fourth in 
rebounding but was the smallest 
in the conference." 

Kokohn was a team. leader 
who brought a strong will to the 
locker room. 

"S he was always a great 
defensive person," Malone said. 
"She brought leadership and was 
the team captain. She had a good 
work ethic. She got a lot of quiet 
respect: 

Despite her job description as 
dominating the boards and sti-
fling other teams with defense, 

Kokjohn did manage to average 
8.S points per game her senior 
year. 

"She's not much of a scorer 
but we never needed her to 
score," Malone said. "If you can 
rebound, you can play for me: 

Kokjohn planned on coming 
to UCSD and wanted to give the 
team a try. 

"She recruited us," Malone 
said. "She wanted to come to 
UCSD, so she contacted us. She 
played a lot as a freshman: 

Neal was instrumental in 
keeping the Tritons in tough 
games. This year she averaged 9 
points and 5 rebounds. 

"She had that unstoppable;

Sioshball 
Heroics pull 30-
29 victory from 
the jaws of defeat 
By EDWU

UNIVERSITY CITY, Calif. - In 
a game that saw both sides down by 
as many as seven runs, the UCSD 
Guardian beat its rival publication, 
the Koala, in an eight-inning game of 
sloshball with a final score of 30-29. 

While the Guardian took an 
early lead of 9-2 in the second, the 
Koala rallied in the sixth inning 
with nine runs. The sixth inning 
was also witness to two bench-
clearing brawls, and when the dust 
cleared, the Koala was up 23-19. 

After the Koala managed three 
more runs at the beginning of the 
seventh (the last planned inning), 
the Guardian put up a magnificent 
performance, scoring nine runs.

man's line drive past first base with 
two outs proved to be the clincher, 
clearing out the pile of three 
Guardia/l runners at the cooler at 
second base and tying the score at

Despite the heavy intoxication 
of both teams, the Koala went to 
bat to start an extra inning, putting
