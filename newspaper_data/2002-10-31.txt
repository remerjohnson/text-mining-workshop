Proposed integrity 
policy rejected 

Academic Senate sends 
policy back to committee 

By LAURA McGANN 
Associate News Editor 

T he proposed changes to the 
academic integrity policy, which 
stirred con fli ct between con-
cerned students and members of 
the faculty and admi nistration, 
was sent back to the Committee 
on Educational Policy for revi-
sion at the Representative 
Assem bly meeting on Oct. 29. 

The propo ed cha nges would 
have centralized the process in 
which academic integrity cases 
are handled. Currently hand I!''' 
by college deans, the proposed 
proce s would have given control 
of the proceed ings to the student 
conduct coordinator, which is an 
administrative position . 

Concerned student, rai sed 
questions about the legitimacy of 
allowi ng the S C to handle all 
aspects of integrity cases, includ-
ing selecting a hearing board , 
prosecuting the accused and 

deciding upon what disciplinary 
actions should be taken . 

Ten students, the majority of 
whom are members of the A.5. 
Council, attended the assembly 
meeting to show thei r concern for 
the proposed process. The stu-
dents were pleased with the deci-
sion to send the policy back into 
committee, which is what David 
Goodwin, an Eleanor Roosevelt 
Coll ege tudent Council mem-
ber-at-Iarge, sa id snltil'nts "want-
ed the whole time." 

However, EP Chair Stephen 
Cux was not pleased with the out-
come of the meeting. ox was 111 
favor of passing the changes, and 
said that the purpose of the revi-
sions was to centralize the proce~s 
to make it more fair. 

"The CEP policy would sim-
plify the process so that faculty 
have one place to go to report," 
Cox said.

By LISA MAK 
Contributing Writer 

A group of Russian education 
leaders attended a briefing at 
UCSD on Oct. 29 that was 
designed to increase understanding 
of American public education and 
educational reform. 

The briefing was part of the 
U.S. Library of Congress-support-
ed Open World Program, and was 
hosted by the Center for Research 
in Educational Equity, Assessment 
and Teaching Excellence. 

Hugh Mehan, a UCSD sociolo-
gy professor and the director of 
C.R.EATE., led the briefing with 
the Russian del egates. He began 
with an overview of American edu-
cation and reform efforts in the 
past few decades.

While in-state undergraduates 
at the University of California 
have not seen a tuition increase in 
the last eight years, the College 
Board said last week that students 
attending four-year public insti-
tutions in the United States are 
paying nearly 10 percent more in 
tuition and fees than they did a 
year ago. 

Drawing upon the nonprofit 
group's own Annual Survey of 
Colleges, the College Board 
found that an average increase in 
tuition and fees of over 5 percent 
was levied onto all undergradu-
ates at four- and two-year institu-
tions. The study examined over 
2,400 public and private colleges. 

The College Board stated that 
last year's economic recession 
resulted in a decline in state tax 
revenues and endowment gifts, 
forcing students to make up the 
losses with their own money. 

"The states did not do very 
well financially last year," said 
Jennifer Topiel, a spokesperson 
for College Board. "Because pub-
lic colleges rely so heavily on 
state budgets, the expen es that 
couldn't be covered were passed 
down to the students."

Ruiz elicited laughter from the 
crowd when he explained how he 
had become bishop of Chiapas in 
1960. Ruiz was born and grew up 
in Mexico, but was livin g and 
working as a bishop in Rome at 
the time. 

"I felt as if I had been struck on 
the head and remained mute ," 
Ruiz said. "The first thing I had to 
do was to get a geography book 
and figure out where C hiapas 
was." 

for in-state residents on~. Sources: College Board, University of Cal~ornia 
Knowing littl e about the 

region and its people, Ruiz said he 
was at fir t very conservative in his 
role as the head of the diocese of 
San Cristobal de las Casas, the city 
at the heart of C hiapas. 

versities increased by an average of 
$356, or 9.6 percent, from the 
2001-02 school year. Four-year 
private institutions saw an increase 
of$I,OOI, or 5.8 percent. Tuition 
and fees at public and private two-
year colleges rose 7.9 percent and 
7.5 percent, respectively. 

Despite widespread tuition 
increases around the nation, in-
state UC students have not seen 
an increase in education registra-
tion fees for eight consecutive 
years. While campus-specific fees 
have increased gradually via .stu-
dent referendums, in-state UC 
students wil l pay $3 ,429 thi s 
chool yea r in tuition fees and 

about another $430 in campus-
related fees, according to UC 
officials. .

Researchers explain Milky 
Way's slow star creation 

UCSD resea rchers recently discovered 
that the ultraviolet radiation emitted by very 
large, bnght stars is a significant reason why 
the Milky Way and other galaxies produce 
new stars at a relatively slow pace. 

Though astrologers have known for years 
that high turbulence keeps huge clouds of 
hydrogen gas from condenSing into stars, not 
all of the causes for this instability are known. 
According to Ihe UCSD study, when clouds

Alexei G. Kritsuk, a visiting researcher at 
UCSO, and Michael L Norman, a UCSO 
physics professor and senior fellow at 
UCSO's SuperComputer Center, were the 
authors of the study. They based their inves-
tigation on a research paper published earli-
er this year, which reported that large, bri~t 
stars generate sizeable amounts of ultraviolet 
radiation about every 10 mi ll ion years. 
Kritsuk and Norman published their findings

Tuition: 'Affordability' a concern for UC 
conrinued from page I 

islanlrc. Over $20 billion was 
slashed from the 2002 -03 sme 
budget, forcing the University of 
California to rind an alternate way 
to fund outreach programs such as 
the K-1 2 School-University 
Partnership and Central Valley 
Outreach. 

UC spokesperson Hanan 
Eisnel1111an said that California 
has sti ll made affordable educa-
tion a priority, even in light of an 
economic downturn. 

"Affordabili ty is rea lly a cor-
r'e rstone of th e University of 
Cal ifornia," he sa id. "One thing 
UC is known for is keeping ca111-

puse accessible for snldents of all 
economic backgrounds." 

A.S. Council Vice President 
Extcrn ~d Steve Klass, who is also a 
ch'lir of the UC Student 
As ociation, aid that wh.ile in-
sta te tui tion fees h;l\'e not 
increased, the UC Board of 
Regents has been raisi ng fees that 
the sta te has bought out time and 
agai n. Klass sa id he is skeptiC31 of 
the state covering the increasing 
costs in what appears ro be anarh-
er year of economic uncertainty. 

"I recognize that in these diffi-
cult times, tough choices must be 
made," Klass aid. "However, to 
raise student fees and Cut the UC 

budget is extrcmely myopic." 
Despite the ri sing costS of a 

postsec()ndary edu ca ti on, 
College Board ofric lals wcre ~tlll 
quick to point Out the bene lit, of 
a coll ege degree . According to 
the College Board, 1.1 l111 lhon

"Despite this year 's incrca ,c~, 
public colleges and uni\'er~ities arc 
still a remarkable value," College

"Then an indian brother told me, 
'Why don't you learn my language a 
little bi t, like T learn your language a 
little bit, and maybe we can meet in 
the middle.' I saw he was right" 

Ruiz explained that the process 
by which he came to see the injus-
tice of the si tuation of the local 
people, who were forbidden to 
walk on the sidewalks unti l the 
1970s. Overcoming the struggle, 
he said, was a lengthy and gradual 
one. 

"My eyes were open, but I was 
not seeing the Chiapa ' reality," 
Ruiz said. 

Ruiz went on to explain that, 
with the help of dialogues held by 
the Ro man Catholic Church 
addressing the question of how to 
approach differing cultures, he 
started to reconceptuali ze his mis-
sion in Chiapas and to envision a 
mul ticultural church. 

"After this Vatican dialogue, we 
were trying to prp.pare to have this 
dialogue [with the indigenous pop-
ulations) that had not happened for 
500 years," Ruf7. said. "We are fi nd-

Five Pillars of Fai th, the Koran 
and the prop het Mohammed, 
amo ng other topics. 

In addition, Nasser addressed 
certain issues that have caused 
concerns in the past year. At the 
end of the lecmre, students were 
also able to ask questions. 

Junior Lukas Muell er, who 
attended the lecture, said, "I came

The UCSD Guardian IS published twICe a week at the University of 
California at San Diego. Contents (c) 2002. Views expressed herein 

represent the maJolity vote of the editorial board and are not necessar· 
Ily those of the UC Board of Regents. the ASUCSD or the members of 

the Guardian staff. 

Lecturers must 
understand UC's 

limitations 
The University of Ca lifornia and the 

University Council - American Federation 
of Teachers have been at odds with each 
other over a new contract for the past two 
years. The main points of the negoti ations, 
according to the union, are salary, a pay 
scale radler than a pay range, and increased 
job security. 
. With regards to the salary, the Guardian 
teels that the university is bein~ more than 
fair with its offer. Californ ia s budget is 
deep in the red; large cuts have arready 
been made to the UC budget. T he current 
monetary offer is a goodwill gesture toward 
the un ion that the union should accept. It 
ra ises sa laries for both pre-six-year lectur-
ers and post-six-year lecturers, and also 
provides for a 4-percent raise to begin the 
following year. With a la rge budget short-
fa ll , the union should accept this offer. 

T he pay scale, it is argued by the union, 
is faire r than a pay range because it pays 
people who have put in the time. T he uni-
versity maintains that it should pay people 
based on merit rather than simply the time 
that the}' have been teaching. The 
Guardian fee ls that if someone is not doing 
an exceptional job, they should not be 
rewarded more than someone whose per-
formance is stellar si mply because of 
seniority. T he pay range allows the univer-
sity to reward lectu rers who do a good job 
ra ther than those who simply do enough ,to 
get by and automatica lly rise through the 
ranks. 

T he fi nal issue is job security. The union 
wants a formal review process to determine 
whether a lecturer will be offered a three-
year contract after the six-year probation-
ary period is up. The unjon is currently 
alleging that the university is not offering 
three-year contracts to all lecturers in an 
attempt to save money. The Guardian feels 

~hat a formal review process should be 
Implemented after the six-year probation-
ary contract, but the unjversity should be 
free to set any guidelines it deems necessary 
for passing that review. The union could 
then be satisfied that nobody was being let 
go without a review, and the unjversity 
could set the standards it deems nece~sary 
for retaining lecturers.

Designing the perfect political candidate 
Guardian writers weigh in on whom they'd elect 
The idea l political candidate is 

somcone who is honest abom their 
views. T he candidate must stand by 
what he believes in - even to the detri-
ment of his political career - and not 
pander to the masses. T he candidate 
would be someone who doesn't dodge 
issues, but faces them head-on. We 
need people in public office who are 
not afra id of their own convictions, but 
instead are proud of them and are will-
ing to engage in debate about them and 
will stand by what they say in a cam-
paign if they are elected. 

- Alan Henfeld, Contributing Write,. 

Thc ideal candidate would be 
morally upright and care about the 
character and not just the condition of 
his constituency. He or she would be 
practical and intelligent while still 
showing the qualities of an everyman or 
everywoman. Unlike so many candi-
dates these days, he or she wouldn't 
descend from a blue blooded family that 
would pay his or her way through life, 
but rather would understand the typical 
American citi7.en's toils and joys by 
working to get to where he or she 
would be. In other words, the ideal 
political candidate would encompass 
the sacri fice of a teacher, the resolve of 
a leader, the conviction of a preacher, 
the concern of a friend and the empathy 
of you or me. 

- Evelyn Hsieh, Staff Write,. 
Providing a limited government with 

a strong national defense is the motiva-
tion of the ideal candidate. War is a ter-
rible last resort, but the ideal candidate 
identifies conflicts regrettably immune 
to diplomacy, especially when our most 
dangerous enemies are beyond negotia-
tion. As a potential role model and 
defender of the Constitution, integrity is 
everything for him. His badground lies 
in business, where efficiency, persever-
ance and motivationai skills are crucial 
for surviva l. Wisdom is more important 
than knowledge; a conservative's MBA 
speaks louder than a liberal's B.S. 

- Ryan Darby, Smior Staff Writ" 

COMMENTARY 
The ideal political candidate is just, 

wise, courageous, dynamic, brutally 
honest and sharply intelligent. He (I use 
"he" to refer to a person of either sel() 
sees the big picture and acts in the best 
interest of the average person, not his 
most generous contributors. WIth a psy-
che of steel and a fully functional con-
science, he's inunune to the seduction of 
money and power. His ideas and plans 
are efficient, novel and independent of 
any group, political or otherwise; he has 
an uncanny ability to see what needs to 
be done, regardless of what people want 
to be done. In short, he would never 
make it in American politics today. 

- Marianne Madden, Cuntributing 
Writtr 

The ideal political candidate: is intel-
ligent, capable, modest, rational, non-
judgmental, coherent and convincing; 
knows what he talles about and talles 
about what's important; is open to new 
ideas and inunune to big money influ-
ence; has a dearly defined set of ethics 
and a clearly defined set of issues; votes 
for what he believes in rather than what 
his party believes in; is able to laugh and 
able to cry; and most importandy of all, 
sees people as people, not just votes in a 
ballot box. 

- Logan Gob, StlljfWrittr 
The persona and character of my 

ideal political candidate takes key char-
acteristics from many leaders. The wise 

and peace-loving leadership of Gandhi 
would be divine. T he honesty, intcgri-
ty and peace negotiation characteristics 
of Jimmy Carter are a requirement. 
T he trai lbla7.i ng leadership for the less 
fortunate by Eleanor Roosevelt is a 
must. The courage and non-partisan 
leadership as shown by John McCain is 
a requisite. Mix all this together and 
out comes the perfect recipe for the 
ideal candidate. 
- Parisa Baharian, SmioT' Staff Writtr 

Clearly, the ideal political candidate 
is Natalie Portman. She has served as 
the royal leader of Naboo and the 
Senator of Naboo. Natalie also has a lot 
of White House experience, having 
been the First Daughter ("Mars 
Attacks!,,). She received straight As in 
high school, aced her SATs and is cur-
rently attending Harvard. She speaks 
Hebrew, French and Japanese, and has 
an interesting talee on gun control: "No 
women, no lcids" ("The Profession~I") . 
Lastly, I believe the most important 
characteristic about a political candidate 
is charisma, and Portman is incredibly 
charismatic: If she asked me to sell my 
soul to the devil, I'd ask for a pen. 

- Bertrand Fan, SmillT' Staff WriUT' 
My ideal candidate would have the 

guts to speak truthfully on the issues that 
matter instead of running his or her 
mouth with the rhetoric that voters are 
suppostd to find appealing. There is 
undervalued worth in a leader that 
admits to a mistake he or she made while 
in office. In an era plagued with corpo-
rate corruption, a "judge, jury and exe-
cutioner" foreign policy, and an energy 
law responsible for the fleecing of bil-
lions from Californians, it is no wonder 
that our nation's consumer confidence is 
the lowest it's been in nine years. It 
would be easier for us to cope with the 
truth about an error than one of the 
well-calculated lies or half-truths we find 
everyday on page one. Just tell us the 
tru th and don't ri p us off.

Daschle is playing politics again 
Senate majority leader lacks consistency 

By DUSTIN FR~LlCH 
S taft Writ e r 

T hrough recent action, Senate 
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-
South Dakota) is proving to 
everyone he is a man withom core 
political beliefs, just poli tical aspi-
rations. lime and again , the sup-
posed "leader" of our U .S. Senate 
is an obstructionist who politici7.es 
everything for individ ual gain 
rather than thinking of anything 
but covering his rea r-end . 

Case in point: the Homeland 
Security Bill. After the bill passed 
in the House in July, Daschle, who 
as Speaker sets the Senate's agen-
da, has been si tting on the bill for 
quite some time because the dif-
ferences between Republicans and 
Democrats cannot be reconciled. 
D aschle and the Dems want to 
give the jobs to union workers, 
while Republicans don't want the 
security of the America n people to 
be tied up in unions, because the 
strucnlre of unions makes it very 
difficult to hi re and fi re workers 
easily, if not utterly impossible. 

In July D aschle said, "We ... 
have a need to begin work on the 
homeland security legislation." But 
now it's OctOber, almost 
November. Is the bi ll going to pass 
the Senate anytime soon? No. And 
considering that the Senate has 
broken for the November elections 
wi th sti ll no agenda for homeland 
securi ty, it's not even close. 

If Daschle is serious about the 
security of the American people, 
not of the politi cal lobbying 
power of union groups, he'd bring 
the issue before the Senate. But 
he'll have none of that; the union 
votes are too important to lose. So 
what are Daschle's priorities here? 

, 

__ 'lI.-'.---

NATIONAL 
Here's the problem with union 

workers being responsible for 
homeland securi ty: If they're 
incompetent, you can't move them 
around or fire them. This is the 
flexibility that a large department 
of the federal government needs. 
Leaders shouldn't have their hands 
tied when they're trying to defend 
our nation. Could you imagine not 
being able to remove a worker that, 
because of his ineptitude, didn't 
stop the next terrorist attack? 

Of the current Bush adminis-
tration, Daschle said in mid-
October, "1 don't know if we've 
ever seen a more precipitous drop 
in international stature and public 
opinion with regard to this country 
as we have in the last two years. " 

Some have criticized Bush in his 
handling of international affai rs. 
The complaints usually include at 
least one of three things: the rejec-
tion of the Kyoto protocols, dis-
tancing the United States from the 
International Criminal Court, and 
pre-emptive action against Iraq. 

Per his earlier quote, its obvious 
Daschle is concerned with interna-

tional public opinion on these mat-
rers. He forgot one thing, however: 
his voting record. Some of you 
might recall that Daschle voted: 
First, to back out of the Kyoto pro-
tocols; second, to forego U.S. partic-
ipation in the International Criminal 
Court; and lastly, he also voted in 
favor of Bush's Iraq resolution. With 
Daschle supporting Bush through 
voting yet publicly condemning 
Bush on his international repuation, 
something fishy is going on. 

The answer to Daschle 's two 
seemingly poli tically incompati-
ble views (of cri ticism and support 
of the current administration) lies 
in maximizing political support. 
By critici7.ing Bush, Daschle solid-
ifies the left and those who think 
certain policies of the Bush 
administration are wrong. 
Similarly, by voting with Bush, 
Daschle attempts to rein in voters 
who think his public comments 
are analogous to rel inquishing 
American interests to the world 
community. Apparently, Daschle 
thinks he can have it both ways. 

Take the Iraq issue. Remember 
the fuss Daschle was causing when 
he was opposing the president and 
his resolution? Well, what hap-
pened? He voted for it. 1 know 
Americans have a short attention 
span, but it's definitely longer than 
a couple weeks. What does Daschle 
stand for? Does he even know? 

By voicing his opposition to 
Bush 's Iraq resolution, in the 
event that Saddam is not seen as 
the threat he seems to be, Daschle 
can say he tried to stOP the resolu-
tion from materiali7.ing. On the 
other hand, if Sad dam proves to 
be a serious threat, Daschle can

Centralized disciplinary 
process suits students 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

O nce agai n, a proposed uni-lateral change of universi-ty policy has created an 
outcry among the student councils 
who find it their charge to defend 
(ineffectively and in vai n) the ri ghts 
of students against encroachment 
by the administration. This time, 
the proposal is to take the decision-
making power in academic dishon-
esty cases from the deans of the 
individual colleges and place it 
entirely in the hands of one adlni n-
istrator. While the proposed policy 
in its current form is ill-form ed and 
dictatorial, without an adequate 
appeals process and separation of 
interests, the divestment of power 
from the individual coll eges is 
nonetheless the correct step for 
academic affairs to take. 

T his columnist has argued 
before that the six-college system is 
an abject fa ilure in comparison to 
its model at Cambridge; students 
are little linked to their colleges 
beyond abstract and meaningless 
academic requirements, the major-
ity of incoming freshmen choose 
their colleges randomly anyway, 
and upperclassmen feel little to no 
loyalty or emotional attachment to 
their particular college. Whi le it 
could be argued that general educa-
tion requirements are enough to 
give the prerogative of disciplining 
academic dishonest\/ to the under-
graduate colleges, . given the fact 
that students identi fy with their 
major far more than their college, 

rhe proposed changes make sense 
in creating a fair and cunsisrent 
academic dishonesty proccdure 
among students in tile same major. 

T he college sy tem requ ires 
major overha uling if it is to be a 
viable force on th is campus.

twice as many colleges serving the

6 OPINI N THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Moral rejection of 

homosexuality a bias 
Editor: 

I found a previous letter con-
cerning the LGBT article (Oct. 
28, 2002 issue) a bit disconcerting. 
1 agree that Mr. Rowley has a 
point about the student coming 
out anonymously, as well as the 
prospect of heterosexism. And cer-
tainly, there is nothing wrong with 
somebody thinking that hoinosex-
uality is wrong (it goes under that 
whole freedom of thought thing). 

However, I must disagree with 
his protests about homophobia. 
First, what he himself fails to grasp 
is that though a great deal of peo-
ple still see homosexuality as 
morally repugnant, a great deal of 
homosexual people do not view 
heterosexuality as morally repug-
nant. Therein lies a troubling 
imbalance of judgment. When one 
is a bhorrent in the eyes of another, 
then perhaps there is a bit of intol-

erance that Mr. Rowley claims 
those people do not have. 
Secondly, judging a homosexual as 
morally repugnant because he or 
she is different from oneself is a 
simple act of bias. To reject the 
label of a homophobic for such a 
person is like saying, "Don't call 
me a racist; I JUSt believe that whi te 
people are better than blacks. It's 
my belier' (as Mr. Rowley puts it).

IBasically' ignores 
studenrs sensitivities 
Editor: 

nus letter is in response to 
Carrie Sklar's "Basically" column 
printed on Oct. 28. At first I 
thought I had made a mistake and 
was reading The l<DiIlII rather than 
the GuardUm. The comment that 
lcids "Ioole way too much like 
midgets, which, as we all mow, are 

rather frightening" crossed the line 
as acceptable humor. As Sklar 
should mow as an educated college 
student, small people (or "midgets" 
as she ignorantly refers to them) 
have enough problems fighting the 
image of them played out in the 
movies. Sklar's article attempted to 
make relating their appearance to 
freaks acceptable, and it should not 
be able go without criticism. 

While I enjoyed the rest of Ms. 
Sklar's article, particularly the 
handcuffs story, I felt the need to 
write to the GUlmJilm in hopes mat, 
unlike The KDaItl, the Guardilln 
would attempt to work on its social 
conscience and think about how 
such comments can be hurtful to 
students on this campus who may 
not think it is funny mat the 
GwmliJm is fueling the fire of the 
things mey unfortunately have to 
endure as part of their daily reality.

might be thinking of a bid for me

and ride the popu-
larity of Bush (which stands at 
around 70 percent). The only way 
we can show Daschle that we 
won't put up wim his constant 
politicization of the issues is to not 
vote for him, should he earn the 
democratic bid for '04. But at the 
rate he's going, maybe his bid has 
already ended. 

Horse: 20,000 student votes may not actually change the world 
continued from page 5 

ing students to vote (which should 
be apolitical or focused on students' 
rights) digressed into fanciful day-
dreaming about what 20,000 votes 
could do for lesbian, gay and trans-
gender rights, as well as "women's 
rights" (which means "abortion 
rights" these days). 

While this writer has no prob-
lem widl advocating the aforemen-
tioned positions, given the rather 
vocal - and organized, if not large 

- conservative constituency on 
campus, it seems foolish to think 
that all of UCSD's votes are going 
straight to liberal causes. 

Furthermore, if anyone believes 
that 20,000 votes in the Brd con-
gressional di strict are going to 
affect anything, they are sorely mis-
taken; while the 2000 race between 
then-incumbent Brian Bilbray and 
current representative Susan Davis 
did indeed come within 10,000 
votes, recent redistricting gave 

M ·fnI .'~., 
bea 

Davis a rock-solid support base . 
According to the Union-Tribune, 
"the national Republican Party has 
virtually written off the race." For 
that matter, who has even heard of 
Ms. Davis' opponent, Bill 
VanDeWeghe? 

While it is a great thing to go 
vote, apathy will probably rule in 
even these "exciting" midterm 
elections because once again, a ran-
dom and disproportionately small

diocese that was being created in 
the region. Indigenous representa-
tives were elected by their conunu-
nities to participate in this effort. 

"The church must be not only 
directed to the poor, and for the 
poor, but be of the poor, n RUlz said. 
"The results that were reached 
were the products of all partici-
pants, but clearly, there's still a very 
long way ahead of us." 

RUlz insisted on the importance 
today of an international, interreli-
gious dialogue. 

"Especially in the wake of the 
act upon me Twin Towers, we need 
this interreligious dialogue," he 
said. 

Responding to a question from 
me audience as to who he believed 
would be the next pope and what 
challenges me chosen pope would 
face in Latin America, Ruiz said 
that it seemed likely that the next 
pope would be Italian. 

"But we would really seek a 
pope who would represent what 
the future would hold, like an 
African-American pope or a Latin-
American pope," Rufz said. "The 

[current) pope leaves an interesting 
challenge for [the future pope) : 
how to stay close to Rome and at 
the same time carry out this kind of 
missionary work." 

The Burke lecture, which was 
free and open to the public, was co-
sponsored by the UCSD Center 
for the Humanities, dean of the 
Division of Arts & Humanities, 
Center for Iberian and Latin 
American Studies, Center for U.S.-
Mexican Studies, the departments 
of literature and history, the 
Wesley Foundation and the 
Western Dominican Province. 

Education: Delegates study u.s. schools 
continued from page 3 

According to Mehan, public 
education at the elementary ·and 
secondary levels of education has 
been undergoing reform for many 
years. The most recent period of 
reform began in 1983, when a gov-
ernment agency published a report 
showing that American public edu-
cation was in trouble. 

"Our students did not compare 
well to students from other nations, 
including Russia, on international 
tests," Mehan said. "The goal of 
this reform has been to have 
American students compete acade-
mically with students on the inter-
national plane." 

According to Mehan, a variety 
of reform efforts have been made, 
including reforms in the structure 
of education and the curricula that 
school s use. 

"It is unlikely in the United 
States that we'll ever have a nation-
al curriculum. There's a long polit-
ical history that says that education 
is local," Mehan said. 

The emphasis on either nation-
al or local curricula is perhaps the 
greatest difference between 
American and Russian education. 
Larisa Chernyshova, head of the 
English deparnnent at dle Moscow 
State University of Ra ilway 
Engineering, said "in the USA, 
[education) is primarily local." 

Mehan also discussed reform 
efforts with the textbooks that stu-
dents use. 

"There has been considerable 
criticism that the textbooks that 
students use are not adequate," he 
said. "Some criticism of American 
curricula has been done in compar-
ison tojapan, for example, where it 
is said that japanese textbooks 
cover more deeply man American 
textbooks." 

Mehan contends that American 
education has been subject to a 
"standards movement" lately, 
where the discrepancy in education 
quality between social classes is 
being improved through policy. 

After Mehan's introduction of 
American educational reform, me 
delegates participated in a ques-
tion-and-answer session and 
exchanged information on educa-
nonal systems. 

Standardized testing was anoth-
er topic of discussion. Mehan's 
opinion was that the American sys-
tem places too much emphasis on 
tests as opposed to acnlal learning. 
Russia has just recentl y started 
using standard tests. 

"The universal test is bei n g 
introduced now in Russia," 
Chernyshova said. "It is quite an 
innovation. But usually, students 
have to take their entrance exami-
nations at the university or insti tute 

they try to enter. If they pass them 
successfully, they can be admitted, 
but the fact is that there is usually 
severe competition for free educa-
tion." 

Grigory Kapranov, a dean and 
doctor of pedagogical science at the 
Ussuriisk State Pedagogical 
Institute, added mat "the test sys-
tem in Russia has just started and is 
going to be promoted in the 
future." 

Other issues discussed included 
the structure of university educa-
tion, the UC system, exchange pro-
grams, me most popular majors at 
UCSD and the school's faculty. 

The deleg'dtes agreed that there 
are many aspects of the American 
system that they would like to try 
implementing in an effort to 
improve Russian education. 

"The material base of the uni -
versi ties and the foundation for 
carrying out research is richer 
here," said AJ exey lsakov, a manag-
er at Mercy Corps in Russia and 
one of the facilitators at the brief-
ing. 

The delegates emphasized, 
however, that their expectations 
must remain realistic . 

At the end , Mehan felt that the 
briefing on education had been 
success ful. 

"Commun ication across bor-
ders is always important," he said. 

Integrity: Cox blaims students' 'scare tactics' 
continued from page 3 

While in favor of a more cen-
tralized process, students argued 
that giving the SCC complete con-
trol of integrity cases raised multi-
ple conflicts of interest. It was

who practices Islam." 

On Tuesday night, speaker 
Imad AI-Bahri addressed the role 
of jesus of Nazareth in Islam. 

Through the lectures, booths 
and interaction with MSA mem-
bers, students of different back-
grounds were able to learn and 
gather useful facts about Islam. 

"It's roally surprising that it's so 
similar to Christianity," said senior 
Susan Hardjadinata. "I mink peo-
ple have been overly skeptical 
about this religion, and they just 
need to open their minds." 

The last lecture, with speaker 
Sheilc.h Yassir Fazaqa, will be held 
in in Center Hall 105 on Oct. 31 at 
7 p.m. He will speak on the Islamic 
concept of justice by citing specific 
Koran references and how justice 
h . 'en implemented in the past. 

" 

students lobbied professors and 
pushed for the assembly to send the 
proposal bacle to the CEP. 

Cox said that he believed the 
methods used by students to mobi-
li ze support for their agenda 
included propaganda. 

"This is a deplorable strategy of 
scare tactics to convince students 
that there is a plot against snl-
dents," Cox said. 

A strong majority of the assem-
bly voted to have the proposal 
reassessed in committee.

Ha~nted bedrooms, houses and

By VALERIE NCi 

Staff Writer 

WIth its palm trees and beaches, 
you'd never know that San Diego is 
one of the most haunted cities in 
Am erica. Numerous reports of 
ghost sightings and unexplai ned 
phenomena have turn ed many 
famous locations into haunted sites. 

The 110tel Del Coronado, o ne of 
San Diego's Illost famous sites, is 
home to twO famous ghosts. Room 
502, now 3502, was rumored to be 
the love nest of hotel builder and 
owner E.S. Ba bcock . His mistres , 
who was staying in this room, com-
mined suicide suon after learning 
that he was pregnant. The body 
later disappeared, perhaps taken 
awa y to avoid an ugly scanda l. 
Today, lights occasionally nicker in 
the room , while an icy chill may be 
fel t outsidc the door. 

Around Thanksgiving of 1892, a 
pregnant Kate M o rga n checked 
her el fin to the hotel under the 
n.ame Lottie Anderson Bernard . She 
IVai ted in rOOI11 31 2, now 33 12, for

shooting herself in the head \\;th a 
.44 cali ber bullet. T he drapes in the

Elementary students flock to Pepper Canyon for college frights 
By NEHA S. SINGH 

Contributing Writer 

hat does it take to scare a 
bunch of children' Judging 
from Eleanor Roosevelt 

College'S annual Halloween Fest, 
not a lot. Fifty students from 
J ackson Elementary School 
found out exactly how much 
work members of the Student 
Council at ERC and 
Programming at ERC put into 
frightening them on Oct. 29. 

Sinister music greeted me chil-
dren as they were escorted to the 
second floor of the lodge, which 
had been converted to a haunted 
house. It had two dark corners 
wim scary activities like sticking 
hands in a bowls of peeled grapes, 
sliced peaches and other revolt-
ing-feeling items. 

The two other open areas also 
had creepy activities; forrunately, 
none of these resulted in tears . 
The presence of random ghosts, 
vampires and other scary beings 
jumping out was fun, both for the 
volunteers in costumes and 
the kids. The haunted 
house tour resulted in a 
lot of excited but scared 
kids, but to soften the 
eeriness, each child was 
handed a cookie as they 
left the house. 

Students in SCERC 
and PERC worked very 
hard to put on Halloween Fest. It 
was nearly impossible getting 
volunteers to help with the 
haunted house, but after repeat-
ed requests, they managed to get 
people to help pull it together. 
The organizers made me event 

aesthetically pleasing through 
attention to detail and elaborate 
costumes worn by the volunteers. 

All in all, Halloween Fest 
went smoothly. 

"I had a blast putting it on last 
year," said veteran co-chair 

Heather Handley. 
"Seeing the looks on the 
kids' faces at the end 
makes all the hard worle 
worthwhile. " 

The young students' 
energy was contagious, 

and everyone had a great 
time during the two short 

hours. The looles of delight on 
the kids' faces at the end of the 
day made all the frantic worle pay 
off, and ERC students are look-
ing forward to doing it again in a 
year.

Student-run haunted house promises to 
bring good times to brave, curious souls 

By JONA1HAN JOSEPHSON 
Contributing Writer 

his Halloween, be wary of the 
little folie. And I'm not'talking 
about the creepy-crawly 

gremliny things that hid under 
your bed when you were 8. I'm 
talking about children - and there 
will be a lot of them around campus 
this Halloween. 

Every year, the Active 
Community at Thurgood Marshall 
College puts on an event called 
"Safe Halloween." The purpose of 
the event is to provide elemen-
tary school children wim a 
safe and fun environment / 
in which to spend I 
Halloween day. 
Throughout the day, 
80 to 100 first-
through third-graders 
from Jefferson 
Elementary will trick-or-treat 
around Marshall college and partic-
ipate in a Halloween carnival in the 
Marshall uppers cul-de-sac. 

The highlight of the "Safe 
Halloween" is the annual Haunted 
House. With the help of A.C.T 
and other Marshall volunteers, a 
Marshall apartment is made up into 
a multilevel haunted house. This 
year, the guys of Marshall Lower 
apartment 0-3 (and their girl-
friends) will host the house for the 
second year in a row. 

"Fun Fright House" veteran 

Daryll Dorman said he is happy to 
be a part of the event for a second 
year. 

"If I was a kid, I would have 
been quite entertained by last year's 
[Haunted House). but also scared." 
Dorman said . "We gave them 
candy at the end, so if they were 
scared, mey would usually forget 
after the candy ... 

Student Danielle Bluestein said 
that her "favorite part was playing 
very scary music and then dancing 
lilee crazy when it changed to a 
completely silly song." 

However, there is 
something more impor-
tant than scaring the 
kids. "While scaring the 
kids is part of the haunt-
ed house, seeing them 
smile and laugh is even 
better," Bluestein said. 

The children of Jefferson 
Elementary will be visiting the 
Marshall lowers in the morning. 
The "Fun Fright House" of 0 -3 
will be open to the rest of campus 
only in the early evening, time to be 
announced. 

So this Halloween, look out for 
pop stars, Harry Potter and Sulley 
roaming the campus. Join the fellas 
at 0-3 if you are looking for some 
Halloween fun . Get into the 
Halloween spirit! But remember 
the mantra of the Active 
Community at Thurgood: Have a 
happy and safe Halloween!

All is revealed about the Threefold Law and covens 
By RUTH KOGEN 
Contributing Writer 

itches do not prowl the darkness on 
Halloween, cackling at children and 
sending their blacle cats to cross peo-

ples ' paths. In reality, they get together to 
worship and party. On the night of Oct. 25, 
Wiccans swarmed the Scottish Rite Center in 
Mission Valley for the 16th annual Witches' 
Night Out. CaJafia, the local chapter of 
Covenant of the Goddess, put on this event 
for 600 members of the Wiccan community 
and the public. 

" [The event) has been growing," said 
Christine Brockway, membership correspon-
dence officer for Calafia. "We have limited 
the number of people who come because we 
have to have some room to do the ceremony, 
[We've] been sold out for a good week or two 
now." 

Brockway claims that Wicca has been 
called the fastest growing religion in 
America today. 

"It is hard 
to deter-
mine exact 
numbers 
becaus e 
sometimes 
people feel 
that for 
career or family reasons they must and 
remain in the broom closet," Brockway said . 

Covenant of the Goddess is a league of 
covens and individuals from the United 
States, Canada and abro,ad. It was legally 
established on Oct. 31, 1975, as a non-profit 
religious corporation, with all the rights. priv-
ileges and responsibilities of any church. The 
local branch. Calafia. holds monthly business 
meetings and raises money for scholarships 
and library books, in addition to being the 
connection between local covens (small 
groups of witches) and solitary practitioners. 

Witches' Night Out is a public solemn 
ri tual. T he rite itself varies from year [Q year, 
depending on me wishes of the High Priest 
and High Priestess. 

"It's individual in the sense of how some-
one may want to present it," Brockway said. 
"Last year's ceremony was me Living Tarot; 
that was a different ceremony than we've 
done before, but they put a lot of work in it." 

Witches' Night Out is the celebration of 
Samhain, one of the eight seasonal festivals 
equally spaced during the year, of which Oct. 
3l is one. This is believed to be a night when 
the barriers between the worlds of life and 
death are uncertain, allowing deceased ances-

. tors to walk among the living. At these eight 
festivals, witches seek to raise energy and pm 
memselves in tune with mese natural forces. 
They honor the old goddesses and gods, 
including the Triple Goddess of the waxing, 

full and waning moon and the Horned God 
of the sun and animal life. 

Witchcraft itself is a magical religion that 
derives its traditions from various cultural 
and historical sources. It is an earth religion, 
which means that its members strive to be in 
harmony with the earth and with all life. 
Earth religions oppose the exploitation of the 
earth as a resource to be subdued. Also called 
Wicca, witchcraft attempts to link to the life 
force of nature, on earth and beyond. The 
religion revolves around the idea that each 
person possesses the ability experience a feel-
ing of oneness with all life. There is no bible, 
no one document to study, but a witch may 
keep a Book of Shadows, which is an individ-
ual workbook or journal. 

So how can witches be considered one 
group if they do not share a common text? 

"It's not like we're Episcopa lians or 
Lutherans or something like that," 
Brockway said. "[There is al basic structtlre, 

but a great deal of variance among covens." 
There are certa in principles that 

almost all 
Wiccans 
su bscri be 
to. The 
first is the 
Wiccan 
Rede, their 

version of 
the Golden Rule. It reads, "Do as you 

will, as long as you harm none." The second 
idea is the Threefold Law: "All actions, 
whether positive or negative, have a natural 
consequence and what you do is returned to 
you threefold." Lastly, most believe in the idea 
of reincarnation. Myths about witches are often 
perpetuated by popular culture, yet investiga-
tions into the religion quickly invalidate these. 

First, witches do not worship m e devil. In 
fact, they do not believe in the devil at all . 
The C.O.G. Web site asserts that Satanism is 
a Christian heresy ra ther than a pagan reli-
gion . In addition, witches are not only 
women; in England, men actually dominate 
the religion . However, do not call these men 
warlocks, because most would take offense at 
this. Wicca n men are call ed witches. 
Contrary to many cartoons, witches do not 
fly on brooms. This persistent image comes 
from a misinterpretation of an old rural 
European ceremony. Finally, witches rarely 
cast spells because caution must be exercised 
under the Threefold Law. To find out more 
about witchcraft, you have to go seek out 
information in books or online. 

"We are actually told [in the religion] th3t 
we may not proselytize," Brockway said. 

However, a great deal of information about 
Wicca can be found on the Coven of tile 
Goddess Web site at http://www.cog.arg and at 
the local Calafia Web site. bttp://1JJ7JJ'W.cog-
calofia.org.

Th e festi vi ties, 
wh ile varying great-
I)' throughuut differ-
en t parts of l\I1.exico, usu-
ally include such compo-
nentS as crafting and deeorat-

in~ elaborate altars, preparing an 
abundance of food for picnics in 
the cemetery, and other religious 
rites. Offerings of the deceased rel-
atil'e 's favorite foods and drinks are 
displayed at the altar, since their 
spirits are believed to journey 
home from the afterlife for this 
occasion. 

There is nothing morbid about 
the holiday; on the contrary, the 
altars and the decorations are 
ornate and colorful. In short, while 
there is time set aside for quiet 
remembrance at the graves of the 
deceased, this is 3 social, festive cel-
ebration of the live of the departed 
rather than a celebration centered 
around death . 

Some San D iego residents cele-
bratetl the Day of the Dead early: 
The Sherman Heights Communi ty 
Center devoted Oct. 25 and 26 to 
celebrati ng Dia de los Muertos. 
Festivities started on Oct. 25, with 
local residents of Mexican heritage 
bringing over 14 homemade altars. 

At noon on Oct. 26, the altars were 
blessed wi th Aztec dances from the 
Danza Toltecas en AztHn dance 
company, and the remainder of the 
weekend consisted of several work-
shops (including one teaching how 
to uecora te sugar skulls), a tour of 
house altars and a large quantity of 
traditional \1exican food, including 
the pan de muertos. 

"The event attracted a pretty 
diverse crowd," said Merle Prestoll, 
coordinator of arts and cultural 

programs for the Shernull 
H eights COlllmunity 

Center. Prcston esti-
mated that the event 
attracted around 
1,000 pcople over 
the course of the 
weekend . 

Preston gave 
community members 

credi t for n;uch of the 
celebration's success, 

explain.ing that they deco-
rated and made the altars, 

and sold the food. 
"It was a very traditional day of 

the dead, and [community mem-
bers] made offerings [in the work-
shops) that you would put on the 
altars," Preston said. 

For those who missed last week-
end's fun, however, it's not too late 
- more festivities will be held on 
the Day of the Dead proper, with 
an even.ing celebration :It the an 
Diego Chicano Park under the 
Coronado Bay Bridge from 6 p.m. 
to 9 p.m. on Nov. 1, as well as a car-
aV:ln tour of al tars in the San Diego

6 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

in the Seuss Room of Geisel 
Library on Oct 3 I. 

There will be three separate 
shows, with free admission to each. 
T he eveni ng begins at 7 p.m. with 
a series of short silent horror fi lms. 
Longer, feature-length silent films 
wi ll follow. At 8 p.m., "Dr. j ekyll & 
Mr. Hyde" will bc hown, and 
"The Phantom uf the Opera" will 
be presented at 9:30 p.m. 

Both "Dr. j ekyll & Mr. llyde" 
and "The Phantom of the Opcra" 
will be the silent versions pro-
duced during the silent era of 
American cinematography. 

The films that will be shown 
are all from the permanent film 
collection at Geisel Library. 
Musical instrul1lents from the col-
lection of Scott Paulson, the 
orchestra director, will accompany 
the presentation of the films . 

The key aspect of the Teeny-
Tiny Pit Orchestra is that it 
encourages audience participation 
during its preserttations. On 
Halloween night, the audience 
will have a chance to contribute 
sound effects during the spooky 
films. They can bang on thunder-
sheets, play with rain wheels and 
wind machines, playa theremin or 
clatter teeth and bones. 

The audience wi ll also be able 
to t:lke instru-
ments home 
with them. I 

According 
to Paulson, the 
TIPO is "a sma ll perfor-
mance ensemble that 
does live music and 
sound effects 
while silent 
films are 
rolling." 

T he grotlp per-
forms at least once

Seussical the musical: It's whim-

Dr. Seuss' classic childrens stories on stage

Gertrude McFuzz. The Wi ckersham Brothers . Sour Kangaroo and her son . Horton

"Scussical the Musical," a fu ll -
length musical theater production 
based on the stories and characters 
of the internationally loved chil-

opened Oct. 29 to a packed house 
at the Civic Theater downtown. 
Written by the Tony Award-win-

and playwright) and Stephen 
Flaherty (composer and play-
wright) of "Ragtime" and "Once on

character, T he Cat in the Hat, 
played by "America's Sweetheart 
of Gymnastics" and the quintes-
sential Peter Pan, Cathy Rigby. 
The Cat in the H at serves :IS a 
guide to young jojo (Richard 
Miron) and shows him the won-
derful extremes that his "thinks" 
can take him if he sets his mind to 
it. Along the way, Jojo befriends 
Horton the Elephant (Eric 
Leviton), with whom he bonds 
and helps put his life into perspec-
tive. With costumes and sets 
whose style lies somewhere 
between "The Lion J(jng" and a 
filled-out coloring book, 
"Seussical" is quite the optical 
sight. 

One of the darling aspects of 
"Seussical" is Rigby's penetration of

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 13 HIATUS 

Ghosts: Listen closely for Whaley's wails 
continued from page 9 

being moved by themselvcs and 
armoi re doors opening in the 
middle of the ni ght. Sometimes, 
the temperature of the room will 
get uncomfortably warm, with 
the air condi ti on ing and open 
window not helping at all. 
Occasionally, there will be rhe 
impression of someone having 
laid on the bed, despite the fact 
that the maid has freshly made it 
lip. You may even hear th e 
sounds of card playing in the 
otherwise unoccupied room. 

The Whaley House in Old 
Town is li sted by the United 
States Department of Commerce 
as an au thentic haunted house. 
Owned by the County of San 
Diego, this histo ric house in Old 
Town was built on the site of San 
Diego's early public gallows, 
where Yankee Jim Robinson was 
hanged in 1852 . 

"We do not know exactly how 
lllany people were hung here," 
head docent Lynn Hamilton said. 

Two of Anna and Thomas 
Whaley's children died in the 
house, but neither haunts it. 
However, on the stairs, visitors 
have felt chills where Anna 
Whaley was once held at gun-
point. Some people have also 
been able to smell her lavender 

perfume. 
"Outside, you might sme ll 

Thomas \"'haley's cigar smokc, 
since he could not smoke inside," 
volunteer docent Danielle Fun.k 
said . 

You may eve n feel the 
Whaley's dog brush up against 
your leg. Women have often felt 
a child grabbing their hand , but 
when they expect to see their 
own ch ild there, they don't see 
anyone. The hand -grabber is 
believed to be the Whaley'S 
great-granddaughter. 

At the nearby Casa de 
Estudillo , a restored adobe home 
of the commander of the 
Presidio, jose Maria Estudi llo, 
there have also been occurrences 
of unexplained phenomena. In 
the master bedroom, you ca n 
experience ei ther a cold or a hot 
feeling. If there is a hot feeling, 
the spirits are friendly. If it is 
cold, then the spirits are not 
happy. In the blue room, people 
have seen and felt the presence 
of ghosts. Others have heard 
pianos playing at night, even 
though the house is locked tight, 
and there are alarms that would 
go off if someone were to break 
in . However, employees are 
reluctant to believe that any of 
these reports are true. 

The Star of Indl:! s ailin~ ship 
in the San Diegu Ba y has al so 
experienced it s fair share of 
haunts. In 1884. a yuung ~ lO\\' ­
away named John Campbell was 
put to work afrer bein g e1i,cOl'-
credo One day, he lost his fO() lIl1 ~ 
high in rhe ri ggllIg and fell on t: 
hundred fee t to rh ... deck. Bot h 
his legs were crushed; he died 
three days later and was btll'ied at 
sea . 

l 'oday, v i ~ itors to the ship 
have reponed a cold hand 
touching them when they are 
near the mast where Campbell 
fell. In the sh i p 's galley, th e 
smell of fresh baked bread can 
sometimes be smelled, de pite 
the fac t that the stove has been 
cold for many years. Even as the 
ship sits still in the water, people 
have witnessed the pots and pans 
above the stove move. You ca n 
also feel t he cold and fear that 
haunrs the ship when visiting the 
sleeping quarters where crew -
men died after acci dents or 
fa lling ill. To learn more about 
ghosts in San Diego, check out 
"San D iego Specters: Ghosts,

'Comedian' is gold, Seinfeld is golden 
An intriguing look at standup comedy through eyes of veteran 

By BIUY GIL 
Contributing Writer 

Most people are familiar with the story of Jerry Seinfeld: Successful standup comedi-
an gets his own show in 1990 ... 
yada yada yada ... it's one of the 
most successful television shows of 
all time. However, no amount of 
previous success can prepare him 
for the daunting task of creating 
over 60 minutes of new material 
and venturing back to the small 
du bs that hel ped spawn his suc-
cess. 

Director Christian Charles and 
producer Gary Streiner followed 
Seinfeld with hand-held cameras 
on his club tour for over a year, 
filming everything from perfor-
mances, to heckling crowds, to 
conversations with friends and fel-
low comedians about the struggles 
and insecurities that come with 
doing standup comedy. It's a long 
way from shrinkage and puffy 
shirts. 

Paralleling Seinfeld's journey is 
that of Omy Adams, a cocky 
young comedian seemingly on the 
verge of both success and a ner-
vous brealcdown. It's fascinating to 

Film 
REVIEW 

see the young comic come down 
from the high of a successful gig to 
find that he is still unhappy, lying 
on the sidewalk and reflecting 
aloud to himself. 

Unfortunately, Adams's insecu-
rity and overbearing cockiness 
wears thin. He is obviously talent-
ed and on his way up in the enter-
uinment world, but watching him 
snivel after every gig becomes 
tiresome. Even Seinfeld has to tell 
him to relax at one point in the 
movie (this is the same Jerry 
Seinfeld who included complaints 
about airpOrt bathrooms in his 
previous act). 

As one of the most successful 
comedians of all time, Seinfeld's 
insights are incisive and engag-
ing. Coupling Seinfeld's practical 
relation to the world of comedy 
with Adams's inexperienced, spi-
raling emotional overdrive is 
what ultimately drives the film, 
however overtly this theme is 
presented. 

An abundance of cameos are 
also welcome, since they provide 
more points of view than the two 
subjects of the film can offer. 
Ranging from the established, 
such as Colin Quinn and Jay 
Leno, to the legendary, like Bill 
Cosby, each appearance helps 
drive home how far-reaching and 
laborious comedy is. A particular-
ly refreshing anecdote comes from 
Chris Rock, who tells Seinfeld 
that a recent two-hour Cosby act 
he saw was the best comedy show 
he had ever attended. 

"Comedian" is successful 
because it manages to be funny 
and enlightening at the same 
time. More footage of the actual 
acts could have livened up some 
of the slower parts of the film, 
but overall, it's definitely sponge-
worthy.

ment with the audience. At one 
point, Rigby grabbed a boy out of 
the crowd (with his mother standing 
by) and had him conduct the pit 
orchestra. At another dramatic point 
in the show, Rigby stopped the show 
and covered the first row of patrons 
with Silly String. "I have to do it, 
I'm sorry," she said, while showering 
the high-dollar clientele to the 
booming amusement of the audi-
ence and her own personal glee. 

With all of the fantastic cos-
tumes, sets, characters and situa-
tions that appear in a Broadway 
show, it is amazing that the single 
most astounding aspect of the per-

show was over. 

Mter her curtain call , Rigby 
made an announcement to the 
audience, which major stars ofren

everyone for coming and giving 
their time and money to support 
live theater, bur confronted her 
audience with all due pathos by 
calling up Audrey Geisel, the wife 
of the late Dr. Seuss. The woman 
of far more years than her energy 
and vivacity would indicate took 
center stage along Rigby and 

received a standing ovatio n. After 
a short anecdote by Rigby about 
their first meeting. Audrey Geise l 
was given the microphone. With 
the voice of a thousand grand-
mothers, she shared thi s simple 
analysis of the show and the cu l-
mina ting poi nt of her late hlli-
band 's work: "What was lacking in 
N ew York ... " - and the entire 
crowd held its brea th - u ... was 
found here." 

H ere, in San Diego. Here, in 
the heart of the little boy pulled on 
stage after intermission and given a 
baton with which he was instructed 
to conduct the pit orchestra of the 
Broadway show. 

The moment, like the show, was 
truly magical.

THURSDAY, ocrOBER 31 , 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 19 

Men's soccer: Tritons pull out needed win 
conrinued from page 20 

of the season) with an assist from 
Sean Summers at 19:30, and mid-
fielder Matthew Davey, the 
Tritons' free-kick specialist, 
scored his fifth goal of the season 
when UCSD was awarded a 
penalty lcick at 44:40. 

Later on, Triton forward TIago 
Venturi lcicked off the second half 
by tallying a goal in the 65th 
minute with an assist from mid-
fielder Ryan Blair. After the 
Tritons took a 3-1 lead, play inten-
sified and UCSD ended up on the 
short end, getting only one corner 
kick to the Broncos' seven during 
the second half. 

"It was disgusting. The referees 
turned on us and were very biased," 
said Triton head coach Derek 
Armstrong. 

The Broncos were able to 
come bacle and tie it up 3-3 in the 
second half when midfie1der Kory 
Felix started it off by scoring an 
unassisted goal at 79:36 to make it 
3-2. 

Bachanas left his team short-
handed after receiving a red card in 
the 85th minute, but the Broncos 
were able to tie it up and force 
overtime when forward . Peter 
Wallace kicked one in with less 
than two minutes remaining in reg-
wation. 

Despite losing their lead and 
being outshot 11-3, the Tritons 
fought hard. 

Only two minutes into double 
overtime, Venturi, the Tritons' top 
goal scorer, scored the game win-
ner for his eighth goal of the sea-
son. 

Water polo: Tritons don't 
capitalize on opportunities 

continued from page 20 
gOOQ," Peterson said. "When you 
don't cash in on the offensive end, 
you're not going to be successful." 

Onken noted the defense's con-
tributions to the Tritons' effort. 

"Our defense gave us an oppor-
tunity to win," said Onken, who 
finished the game with II saves. "If 
there's something we can take away 
from this game, it's that we had 
oppornmiries. We didn 't play 
badly. We showed that we could 
play with MPSF teams." 

In the Pepperdine game, UCSD 
continued substituting six-fo r-six. 

"They were definitely worn 

down by the end of the game," 
Peterson said. "If we win [the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championship, six-on-six substinl-
tions] will be a main reason." 

The Tritons look to bounce back 
on the road this weekend. First, 
they'll travel to Santa Barbara on 
Nov. 1 to take on the UC Santa 
Barbara Gauchos, a team with which 
they have split two games this sea-
son. On the following day, UCSD 
will go to No. 9-ranked Long Beach 
Stare to take on the 4gers, who beat 
the Tritons 7-5 earlier in the year 
and 12 - II last year in a double-over-
time game at Canyonview Pool. 

Seema ~Guotdian 
LookinC for the open lINIn: Freshman utility Jesse CaseUini (No. 22) holds the 
ball and tries to find a teammate to pass it to during the Tritons' loss on Oct 27. 

Swim: Teams should be able 
to improve from last year 

continued from page 20 
2:24.18, a National Collegiate 
Athletic Association automatic 
qualification time. 

Gaining significant points for 
UCSD on the women's side, 
Watanabe, Delurgio, Francis Tl'2n 
and Hearon came in second place 
in the 400 medley relay, swimming 
a 4:05.19. 

With the first official meet of 
the season behind them, both the 
men's and women's teams gear up 
for several months of intense train-
ing and competition. UCSD head 
coach Scott McGihon has high 
hopes for the 2002-03 season. 

"[ expect the men's team to 
move from 13th into the top 10, 
and the women's team to move into 
the top three," said McGihon, pre-
dicting the team's rankings in 
NCAA Division ll. 

Competition in Division n gets 
tougher ev~ry year. The time stan-
dards for the NCAA meet are faster 
this season, making it more difficult 
to qualify. McGihon, however, 

expects the team to do well. 
Co-captains Allison and senior 

Luca Brammer will lead the men, 
while co-captains Watanabe and 
junior Carolyn Kwok will head the 
women. Aside ftom these leaders, 
an imponant asset to the Tritons is 
a group of talented incoming swim-
mers. 

"We have a strong group of 
rookies on both squads," McGihon 
said. "Standout rookie women 
include Sarah Grant and Sophie 
Levy. Standout rookie men include 
freshman Amadeus Regucen, fresh-
man Jason Narlock, junior Tanner 
Sheldon and junior Steve Judy." 

With these newcomers assisting 
the experienced UCSD swimmers 
and divers from last year's teams, 
both the men and the women antic-
ipate a successful season. The 
Triton men~ and women's diving 
teams will next compete at the USC 
Diving Invitational from Nov. 7 
through Nov. 9, while the swim 
teams will attend the Cal Baptist 
Relays in Riverside on Nov. 9. 

The victory places UCSD at 
the top spot in the CCAA South 
Division, while Cal Poly Pomona 
falls to second place. The Broncos 
have an overall record of 8-8-1 
and 7-5-1 in conference play after 
the loss. With the victory, the 
Tritons improve their record to 
10-5 overall and 8-5 in the con-
ference. 

The Tritons still must at least 
tie their final regular season game 
to secure a spot in the playoffs. 
Fortunately for UCSD, its final 
match-up is against CCAA South 
bottom-dweller Grand Canyon 
University on Nov. 2. 

"[The Grand Canyon game) 
will be good because they have 
nothing to lose, but we have to 
earn it ourselves," Armstrong 
said .

SPORTS THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2002 zo 
Why not 

watch when 
you can't play 

the game? 
pum's 

Anu Kumar 
've followed sports for as 
long as I ca n remember. I can 
just about watch any kind of 

sporting event - there have even 
been times when T have caught 
myself watching the World's 
Strongest Man competitions on 
ESPN2. 

When people ask me, "What is 
your favorite pectator sport?" 
(collle to think of it, I haven't ever 
been asked that in person, but I've 
seen the question on paper before), 
I have to think for a while before 
answering and ort through the list 
of sporting events I've 'witnessed, 
which would definitely be longer 
than any of Illy Christmas wish 
lists. 

I lowcver, I was recently slapped 
in the face with a va ri ation to the 
question. In a junior coll ege class r 
took over the su mmer, a teacher 
:\\ked the c1as. why we would be 
spectators II1stead of gOlllg out and 
bei ng playcr~. She nude an inter-
c~tlng POIl1I. but I refu sed to agree 
with her message that watching 
sporting events is a waste of time. 

There is no doubt that r would 
ra her be ou t on the Staples enter 
floor hittin1{ the clutch 20-footer 
imtead of ~\'atching Kobe Bryant 
do it from the Ia t row of the arena. 
I would even rather be the one 
'oinking the downhill putt to win a 
tournament for the Triton golf 
tC:llll instead of being a spectator 
and writing about the athlete who 
acnl3 l1 y did it. 

I even sit in the oudield bleach-
ers, heckling the fielder who bob-
hi es a line drive that is hit to him. r 
laugh at him and ye ll , "You suck! r 
could pl ay your posi tion better 
th ,1n you do! " while trying not to 
spill Illy Coke or drop my hot dog. 
After hearing me say that, my sum-
Iller school teacher would probably 
look 3t me and ask me why I don't 
go out onto the fie ld and try to play 
better instead of mocking bad out-
fielders like Ba rry Bonds. 

Teddy Roosevelt might have 
agreed with her. He once said, 
"The credit belongs to the man in 
the arena whose face is marred by 
dust and sweat and blood, who 
strives valiantly, who errs and who 
comes up short agai n and again, 
who knows the great enthusiasms, 
the great devotions and spends 
himself in a worthy cause." 

I've shed blood and sweat on 
the fie ld before, and it was there 
that I learned I belong in the stands 
instead of in the game. I've spent a 
lot of ti me pl aying many different 
sports, and, Mr. Roosevelt, it usu-
ally takes talent as well as enthusi-
asm and devotion to be a player. 

I rea lize that the athletes whom 
I watch have worked hard to reach 
the stage where they are, but I 
know that it began with raw talent. 
Anyone can pl ay pon s, bu t 
becoming the athlete that people 
go to watch takes more than just 
effort . 

Although I sit in the stands and 
watch the game being pl ayed 
instead of running out to my posi-
tion on the fie ld, I'm always going

Tritons move into first 
Men's soccer wins, takes division lead 
By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 

Contributing Write r 

The UC D men's soccer 
team had to face double jeop-
ardy in its hunt for a 
California Collegia te 
Athl etic Association playoff 
berth. 

First, the Tritons had to 
beat a Cal State San 
Bernardi no team that defeated 
them earlier this season. ot a 
problem: UCSD won the Oct. 
26 match 3-2 . 

Sti ll in danger of losing a 
berth into the postseason, the 
Tritons' next challenge was an 
away game against top-ranked 
Cal Poly Pomona three days 
later. 

Once again, the Tritons 
played an incredible game 
and brought themselves one 
step away from postseason 
play, defeating the Broncos 
4-3 in a double-ove rtime 
thriller. To make the victory 
even swee ter, the Tritons 
beat the Broncos in their 
final home game of the sea-
son and tole the top spOt in 
th e division.

UCSD ties Broncos, 1-1 
Women's soccer holds on to first place 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Contributing Writer 

T he o. 6-ranked Tritons clearly have their 
eyes on becoming the No. 1 seed in the con-
ference, as their hard-fought 1-1 tie in the 
C alifornia Collegiate Athletic Association 
game on Oct. 29 at Cal Poly Pomona vividly 
indicates. 

Despite the stiff competition that resulted 
in an injury for Triton midfielder Megan 
M.endoza, the players "battled hard," according 
to head coach Brian McManus. 

UCSD ra ll ied in the 83rd mi n ute of the 
game, when Shannon Harre lson brill iantl y 
blas ted the ball into the Broncos' goa l to t ic 
Cal Poly Pomona in an especia ll y di ffic ul t 
away game. 

T he Bro ncos had a 16-3 edge over the 
T ritons in shots, a 5-3 lead in corner kicks 
and a lone goal throughout the earl y stages o f 
the game, but the Tritons didn 't give the 
Broncos the chance to follow up their initi al 
advance. 

In the words of fullback Kris tin J ones, the 
Triton defense "stepped it up," and this was 
helped by the fact that most of the shots taken 
by the Broncos were "off hard," as McManus 
evaluated his aggressive opponents' lack of aim.

"We showed a lot of heart in an overall team 
effort," Jones said. "If we 're down at any time, 
[the Tritons) can come back." 

UCSD made its intent of clinching the 
No. 1 seed obvious when it began to pull 
together and roared back, wasting little time

Waves sink 
men's water 

polo at 
Canyonview 
Tritons lose to 
Pepperdine for 

second time 
By OWEN MAIN 

Staff Writer 

T he UCSD men's water polo team 
lost 11 -8 to M ountain Pacific Spons 
Federation leader Pepperdi ne University 
on Oct. 5 in the opening game of tile 
N orCal Tournament. On Oct. 27, the 
Tritons looked for payback when the 
Pepperrune Waves visited UCSD to take 
on the Tritons at Canyonview pool , where 
the Waves edged the home team, 5-4. 

UCS D started out strong, striking 
fi rst on an opening period breakaway 
goal by sophomore Brandon Borso with 
an assis t from senior goalie Lance 
O nken. 

But Pepperdine struck back with a 
goal of its own. William Rodriguez got l 
hot past O nken in the second period . 

Rodriguez's goal fini shed the scoring in a 
firs t half marked by great defense on both 
sides of the pool, along with mis ed 
oppornmities. 

In the third period, both offenses 
came to life . The twO teams traded 
goals before Pepperdine's i\ l ichael 
Hausmann and Jesse Smith netted con-
secutive goals to give the Waves a 4-1 
lead. But with 12 second s remaining in 
the period, Triton ophomore Clark 
Peterson scored to bring UC D to 
within one goal. 

"We were getting good looks at the 
goal," said Peter on, who is second on 
the team witll 28 goals for the season. 

T he Tritons tied the game at four 
early in the fourth quarter on Borso's sec-
ond goal of the game and seemed to be 
gaining ome momennlm . But on the 
Waves' next possession, Smith returned 
the favor, scoring his own second goa l of 
the game to give Pepperdine a 5-4 lead. 

D espite opportunities late in the ga me 
for the Tri tons, the final five minutes 
were scoreless: A fitting end to a hotly 
contested battle on the de fensive end. 

"It wasn't our best game," said sopho-
more driver Travis Boettner, who scored 
one of the Tritons' third-peri od goals on 
a six-on-five situation . "L ance played 
really well, but we didn 't shoot well . We 
missed a lot of open opportunities and 
didn't play our best game." 

Peterson echoed Boettner 's senti-
ments. 

"Everything but our shooting was
