JSOE dean of n ine 
years to step down 
Conn to return to classroom after 
leading school to new heights 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Robert Conn, dean of UCSD's 
Irwin and Joan Jacobs School of 
Engineering, will step down from 
his position July 1 in favor of 
rentrning to the position of profes-
sor. 

"This is the right time to step 
down for me and for the Jacobs 
School," Conn stated in a press 
release. "With as much as has been 
accomplished, there is still much 
more to do. Over the next nine 
years, UCSD will continue to grow 
at a robust rate, and engineering on 
our campus will continue to grow 
along with it." 

Troy Anderson, associate director 
of communications at the Jacobs 
School, added, "It\; his ninth year as 
dean, and he just sort of felt it was 
time to step down. He's been doing 
academia for a long time, and it had 
been a long appointment for a dean."

Biologists report environmental 
dangers caused by ants 

According to research conducted by environ-
mental biologists, the presence of the Argentine ant 
in Califomia's coastal region has caused detrimental 
effects to the surrounding ecosystem. 

The Argentine ant has displaced a significant 
number of native ants in the Southwest United 
States. In tum, the population of the homed lizards 
that inhabit the areas invaded by the Argentine ant 
have declined by more than 50 percent due to the 
lizard's preference for the larger size of native ants. 

The significance of the phenomenon is largely 
evident through the indirect effects of like-species 
competition within the food web of the ecosystem 
and how biodiversity works to stabilize such ecosys-
tems. 

Two reports were yielded from the research per-
formed by Andrew V. Suarez, who carried out the 
study alongside a graduate student at UCSD. The 
papers appear in the February issue of Conservation 
Biology and Ecological Issues, and both are co-
authored by Ted J. Case, a UCSD biology professor.

Dean: 
Conn led the school of 
engineering to prosperity 
Continued from page 1 
growth that brought increases in 
the number of faculty, graduate 
students and undergraduates. 

Conn was a fundamental part 
of fusing the sc hool with the 
developing engi neering industry. 
The Center for Wireless 
Communications, the William J . 
von Liebi g Center for 
Entrepteneurism and Technology 
Advancement, and the California 
lnsti tute for Telecommunica tions 
and Information Technology were 
all founded under 

bled since Conn became dean, 
with over $145 million raised dur-
ing his tenure. His influence on 
engineering education has been 
equally important. Conn chaired 
an advisory council to UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson 
that resulted in increased engi-
neering fundi ng and enrollments 
throughout the UC system. 

"This enviable legacy is due to 
Con n's inn ova tive thinki ng, 
strategic focus, passion for educa-
tional excellence and ou tstandi ng 
fac ul ty recruitment," Chancellors 
Robert C. Dynes and Chandler 
stated in an e-mail signed by both 
and sent to all students. 

Conn arrived at UCS D in 
1994 after serving as professor of 

engineering and 
Conn's tenure. 

D uring his 
deanship, the 
Jacobs School's 
research funding 
has grown from 
$33 million to 
$112 million and 
is now third in 
the nation in 
average research 
funding per facul -
ty member. 

'He leaves a

Watson steps on 
plans to boost 
friendly rivalry 

In ;In effort to bolster the brewing rivalry 
between UCSD and University of 
California at Davis, the Triton Tide recent-
ly worked with UCSD's athletics depart-
ment to have a beer garden at the upcoming 
basketball game against the Aggies. 

The troper paperwork was being 
processe smoothly until the event was 
reportedly nixed by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Jo~eph Watson. The 
Guardian feel~ that this was an unwise move 
that will only hurt the potential rivalry 
between the two schools. 

\ Vith virtually no athletic games between 
the Tritons and the Aggies prior to UCSD's 
jump to Division II two years ago, there 
really isn't a rivalry. A rivalry is not some-
thing that can be established overnight. It is 
something that develops over time and 
needs to be fostered by the people it 
involves. 

Take a look at the great collegiate rival-
ries of today: Army and Navy; Duke and 
North Carolina; UC Berkeley and Stanford. 
The one thing that all of these rivalries have 
111 common is history. These teams have met 
hundreds of times over several different 
sports. Their rivalry wasn't something that 
an admi nistrator decided on in an instant. 

While our "rivalry"with UC Davis is 
slowly developing, the fostering of the 
notion was dealt a severe blow by Watson's 
proverbial ax. Apparently, the reason behind 
the dismissal of the event was that UCSD 
needs to re-evaluate its alcohol policy. In 
reality, it was probably more like Watson's 
continued mistrust of the UCSD student 
body to have a good time and be responsible. 

The proposed beer garden would have 
been on RIMAC Arena's gym floor and 
would have had responsible supervision. 
Only people of legal age would have been 
allowed to drink the frosty beverages. This 
would have allowed people to be a lot loos-
er for the game against the Aggies, which is 
what a rivalry is all about. 

It is hard enough for the UCSD Athletics 
Department to get anyone to come to 
games, which makes it hard to start a rivalry. 
While the beer garden would not have been 
the ultimate solution, it would have been a 
great start. 

It would have put butts in the seats and 
put people in a good mood, something that 
UCSD home games have been lacki ng in 
recent memory. 

When you look at it, the beer garden was 
a great idea to promote this rivalry and the 
Triton Tide should be applauded for its 
efforts. This idea shows that the group is 
really trying to create a rivalry. . 

To Watson and anyone else who thought 
that this was a bad idea: Shame on you for 
not trusting the students to have a good 
time and :lct re ponsibly at the same time. 
You only put a bigger wedge between the 
concept of a rivalry with UC Davis and the 
reality of it.

Dissent: It is as American 
as baseball and apple pie 

Let freedom ring, not be stripped away by the 
current American administration 

By ANDREW QUADRI 
Senior Staff Writer 

French Foreign Minister Hubert 
Vedrine recently accused the United 
States of ignoring outside viewpoints. 
The conclusion from many U.S.-based 
Internet message board users: The 
French don't know anything and because 
they've challenged us, they're terrorists, 
so we should bomb them, too. The irony 
there is rather thick. 

r cannot believe I share a country with 
those people. But this is America, where 
evt! ryone is guara nteed the right to 
express his or her opinion, no matter how 
misguided or unpopular that opinion 
may be. That, in fact, is a good thing. 
That's the First Amendment for you. 

Unfortunate ly, sometime between 
Sept. II , 2001 and now, a lot of people-
including President Bush - seem to 
think that the First Amendment only 
allows you to say things that don't critici7..e 
the stanis quo or the U.S. government. 

Did I miss something? Did President 
Bush become the only reputable judge of 
America's best interests the instant the first 
plane hit the World Trade Center? I 
thought we were supposed to be pulling his 
strings, not vice versa . At the rate we're 
going, we won't be ahle criticize his necktie 
neA't February. But maybe that's what the 
president wants: Imquestioned authority. 

At a press conference at the Texas 
State House on i'vlay 21, 1999, Bush sa id , 
regarding a Web site satirizing him, that 
"the re ought to be limits to freedom." 
Being unable to take criticism is one 
thing, but wanting to silence criticism 
contradicts core Ameri can values. 

Now more than ever, our leaders 
should be first in line for criticism. We 
place our lives in their hands, even 
Lhough we haven 't trusted the govern-
ment si nce Richard Nixon was president. 
I was as shaken as every other American 
on Sept. II , but if we are going to trust 
the government, this seem like the 
wrong time to start. 

Criticism is essential to maintaining 
democracy and freedom. Unified opinion 
bel ngs only in a totalitarian state. We 

should not support stilling domestic dis-
sent or sacrifice freedom under the guis-
es of "national security" or "patriotism," 
especially in a so-called democracy. 

The day after the terror ist attacks, 
Bush said that "we will not allow this 
enemy to win the wa r by changing our 
way of life or restricting our freedoms ." 

'Voice or no voice, 
the people can always be 

brought to the bidding 
of the leaders. That is easy. 

All you have to do is tell 
them they are being 

attacked, and denounce 
the pacifists for lack of 

patriotism and exposing 
the country to danger.' 
Goering's assessment is 

too familiar for my comfort. 

Does that mean it's only bad if terror-
ists restrict our freedom? Why are we giv-
ing our government a collective thumbs-
up when it restricts freedom, as it did 
when it passed the USA Pat;riot Act? r 
assume it's because we don't ever want to 
wake up to horror again, like we did on 
Sept. 11 . It's a lousy trade, if you ask me. 

The USA Patriot Act - who would 
vote against it with a name like that? -
states that it aims to preserve freedom. 
But it can't do that when it gives such 
broad surveillance powers to domestic 
law enforcement and international intel-
ligence agencies by eliminating the 
checks and balances that previously 
allowed courts to police the police. 
Previous misuses of power by such agen-
cies prompted those checks and balances, 
after a 1974 revelation that the FEr and 
foreign intelligence agencies spied on 
over 10,000 U.S. citizens. 

You or I could be the next target of 
espionage. As a result of the act, police 

now only n eed to tell a judge that their 
spying could lead to information that is 
"relevant" to all ongoing criminal 
investigation. '"'hat's " relev;lnt"' is any-
one's guess, since you don't even have to 
be the target of the investigati on to be 
spied on. The ac t states that in su ch a 
case, an applica tion for espionage must 
be granted and that the gove rnment is 
not obligated to report what it has 
done. Forget terrorists, tbis scares me. I 
am not free if someone is spying on me. 

I fear the government more than I 
fear terrorists, but I sti ll like America. To 
paraphrase a libertarian motto, we can 
love our country very much but still fear 
our government. I don't know why such 
a view is so difficult to accept in post-
Sept. 11 America. 

One might find an explanation from 
Nazi Air Force commander and war 
criminal Hermann Goering. At his 1946 
trial in Nuremberg, he said "Voice or no 
voice, the people can always be brought 
to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. 
All you have to do is tell them they are 
being attacked, and denounce the pacifi ts 
for lack of patriotism and exposing the 
country to danger." Goering's asses ment 
is too fa miliar for my comfort. We have 
witnessed variations on that theme every 
day since the terrorist attach 

The emerging black-and-white, 
"you're either with us or you 're against 
us" mindset elU'ages me. There is a gray 
area in between, whi ch I will discuss 
later. But many people don't see that and 
so they are frighteningl y quick to label 
others "un-American" if they don't 
blindly support popular opinion on gov-
ernment policy. It is their right to call 
someone "un-American," but that does 
not mean they are right in doing so. 

It is every American's basic right and 
responsibility to state his or her honest 
opinion, regardless of that opinion's pop-
ularity. Even a flawed a rgument or a 
poorly uttered opinio n creates vi tal 
debate if it is printed or vocalized instead 
of kept to oneself. Speak out and ask 
questions before it's too late to ao so.

Freedom: 
Liberty must not be 
undermined 
Continued from page 4 
Thinking cri tically is no t treason: 
Without free thought, the 
democracy that we claim to love 
cannot exist. 

In case you have forgotten, our 
ancestors didn 't come here because 
they wanted to wave fl ags and 
unconditionally kiss their leaders' 
asses. They came for freedom. 
They wanted to fight tyranny, not 
propagate it. A lot of Americans 
seem to have forgotten that. 

What does America value? 
Li berty and justice for all , or 
shi ny things and security at any 
price? America was founded on 
the former, but I see it heading 
toward the laner at the cost of the 
former. That scares me. 

Sticking a U .S. flag to your 
imported sport-utility vehicle -
which runs partly on Middle 
Eastern oil - does not necessari-
ly mean you are a pa triot. 
Wearing an Old Navy T-shirt 
with a U.S. flag on it - which, 
ironically, was probably made by 
some Mus lim kid in an 
Indonesian sweatshop - also 
does not necessarily mean you are 
a patriot. 

By itself, waving a U.S. flag 
doesn't make you a paniot any 
more than eating a carrot makes 
you a rabbit. 

That is not to say that patriots 
don't wave flags, but if you are 
goi ng to wave a flag you should 
be very clear about why you are 
waving it. Ask yourself why you 
support America before you 
become a patriot in its name. 

JVlerriam-Webster 's defini-
tion s of "patriot" and " patrio-
tism" are not as similar as one 
might think. 

T he former, with emphasis 

added, is "one who loves his coun-
try nnd supports its authority and 
interests;" the larrer is simply "love 
for or devotion to ones country." 
Similar, but not the sa me. 

I love freedom and I love 
democracy. I assume that you do, 
too. I hope that our renewed 
patriotism results in record voter 
turnout in the next election. 
Voting is patriotic because, unlike 
simply waving a flag, it supports a 
claim - that one loves American 
democracy - with a meaningful 
action. 

We should expect a record 
turnout, but I have a nagging 
feeling that voter turnout will be 
as lousy as ever. I hope that feel-
ing is wrong. After all, if the 
" attacks on freedom" don 't 
prompt more than the usual 
one-third of registered voters to 
vote, what will? 

r do not support all U.S. 
domestic or foreign policies or 
the government's habit of spying 
on its citizens, but I love the soil I 
stand on and I love the principles 
represented by our Constitution. 

I question people who try to 
stand in the way of those princi-
ples. You could say I practice 
patriotism, but I am not necessar-
ily a patriot. Maybe I'm just a 
semi-patriot. 

I think there are a lot of "semi-
patriots" out there. Feelings 
about America cannot be divided 
into just an "I love America and 
all the good and bad it does" 
camp and an "I hate America and 
want to destroy it" camp. 

There is a third camp, to 
which I belong. It's the "I love 
America and think it is nice but 
know it is not perfect" camp, and 
1 suspect there are a lot of 
Americans who are with me. 

The United States is great, but 
i ts not perfect. We need to realize 
this as soon as possible. A:s any 
decent businessman knows, a

without being perfect. Microsoft 
leads the software industry not 
because it makes the best soft-
ware, but because it devoured its 
competition. 

That tactic may work in busi-
ness, but its no way to run a 
country. 

There is always room for 
improvement. America and 
Americans should always strive to 
improve on the status quo. That's 
the only moral way to stay on top. 
If we benefit from "changing our 
way of life" for the better, that 
hardly means tha t the terrorists 
have won. 

Taking away our freedom 
because we are scared of terror-
ists is not an improvement; it's 
un-American. 

Bona fide patriot Patrick 
Henry asked in I 77 5, "Is Ii fe so 
dear, or peace so sweet, as to be 
purchased at the price of chains 
and slavery?" No one -
whether it is terrorists, our own 
government or fellow ci ti zens -
should be allowed to stunt 
American liberry. 

Henry's question bears repeat-
ed asking now. Ask yourself, ask 
your friends and ask your leaders 
what Americans really want. 

You will find that many 
Americans now want guaranteed 
safety at almost any expense. We 
want safety because we were used 
to thinking that we were safe 
before Sept. II, 200 1. 

Well, we were never safe and 
we never will be, so suck it up 
already. 

Our rights are guaranteed, 
while life is inherently risky and 
has a 100 percent chance of death 
as its resul t. 

We should not be so willing to 
trade guaranteed rights for a gam-
ble on "safety." Given a choice 
between freedom and safety, 1 
choose freedom . Henry phrased 
that more eloquently as "Give me 
liberty or give me death."

6 IllATUS 

Kevin Smith 
chases after 
new film projects 
lSi lent Bob' talks about 
retiring his character, 
confesses dislike for pot 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

Kevin Smith, the creator of "Dogma," "I\\allrats," "Chasing Amy" and the morc recent "Jay and Silent Bob 
Strike Back" looks like hi voice. Tlus per-
plexlI1g concept is not difficult to grasp 
considering that Silent Bob I the charac-
ter Smnh is best known for playing. 

The Illultitalented Smith, who heralds 
from Red Bank, :-iew Jersey, has been in 
the movie business si nce i994 with the 
release of "Clerks," for which he won the 
Filmmaker' Trophy Award at the 
Sundance film fe ·tival that same year. 

SlIIlth ', btc,t work to arrive on DVD, 
"1,1\ and Silent Bob Strike Back," has 101-

I;l\~'ed a mamstream Hollywood approach. 
Unfortunatel)", this advennlre is provll1g 
to be the duo's last. 

"Sometllnes you JUSt want to leave the 
partr he fore you're the last one there," 
said Smith when asked about his decision 
to renrc hiS two most popular characters. 
Smith also said he is done acting and will 
l10t appear m his upcommg movie, "Jersey 
Girl. " 

Removing himself from the limelight 
will force fans to get to know Smith on a 
more personal level. Most will be sur-
prised to discover his vehement dislike for 
llIarijuana , given that Smith 's best-known 
characters treat a joint with reverence.

"\ could really count on onc hand the 
l1umber of times I've smoked pot," Smith 
said. "I really don't like the taste of alco-
hol, either. 'I'd much rather drink Yoo-
I [00 or chocolate milk." 

\Vhile some may conside r Smith a 
Hollywood heavyweight, Smith holds a 
more humble view of himself. "Vhen asked 
what It takes ill order to create a successful 
I [ollywood film Smith responded, "A hom 
rUI1 llIovie should please you, the audience 
alld the distributor." 

lie went 011 further to add, "A home 
run mone takes a commercial ability that 
I don't posses,. ["m not rcally a home run 
guy. 1'111 more of a double guy." 

With his abili tl' 10 "doublc," ho\V~ver, 
Sl1mh ha, garnered a large follOWing for 
hllmclf. Among his less-avid fans, Smith is 
best known for hiS acting, writing and 
dlrcctmg skills. It is little-known th:1t he 
has also conducted many college tours 
around the country in the past several 
years. Some of the foot'lge of Smith 's 
question-and-answer lOurs will be 
released the summer of 2002 on 0 VO . 

lnith attributes the success of his college 
tours to rudents' ability "to l3ugh at a good 
dick or fart joke." Smitll also pointed out 
that the shows appeal to snldents because 
"they have a lot of time to watch movies." 

Smith has a relaxed, impartial attitude 
that he relays through his expressive eye-
brows as Silent Bob. 

As Smith 's public exposure increases, 
so does his public recognition . 

Yet while the popularity of many of 
today's top names in the entertainment 
industry such as Britney Spears depend 
greatly on their sex appeal, Smith believes 
he defies this principle. 

"There is nothing remotely sexua l 
about me," Smith aid . "And my tits are 
bigger than Britney's."

The Irish dance into town 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

ince when can something "cul-
tured" be so much fun and 
entertaining? All it takes are 
the ta ps and footsteps of 

dancers in "Riverdance: the Show" to be 
mesmerized by a lively festival of Celtic 
music and "Riverdance" performers 
amaze audiences with the near-impossible 
speed of their footwork . 

Although "Riverdance" tries to convey 
a story of Iri h folklore and the immigra-
tion from Ireland to America, the show 
doesn't have much of a chorographical 
order and story line. But who cares) 
"Riverdance" isn 't as much about a com-
plex story as it is a celebration of dance . 
Attempts to create a story, such as John 
Kavanagh's narration, seem to draw away 
from the true essence of the performance: 
dance and song. 

Male lead Michael Patrick Ga llagher'S 
lightlllng speed and graceful footwork is 
uttlerl y amazing. His performance is 
superb, but his on-stage interaction with 

female lead Tara Barry is sorely lacking. 
Although the leads prove that they are 
experts at dance, tlley have little chemistry 
together. 

The Irish dance troupe of about 30, 
supporr the leads is not a group of second-
rate performers. Their dance steps are in 
near-perfect unison and bring about an 
amazing, rapid choreography that would 
put just about any chorus line to shame. 
"Riverdance" is a group effort, and it 
shows with strong performances from the 
entire troupe that elevate the show from 
being just a mere highlight of the leads. 

Supporting the dancers is the festive 
"Riverdancc" orchestra, with an eclectic 
mix of instruments that range from fiddles 
to uilleann pipes to accordions. Unlike 
many Broadway shows, the orchestra plays 
a major role and actually performs on 
stage, bringing together both music and 
dance under a fun aonosphere. 

Although widely synonymous with 
Irish dance, "Riverdance" also showcases a 
rich mix of other forms of dance, includ-
ing flamenco, Russian folk ballet and 
African-American tap. Each of the other 

forms of dancing merges with the theme 
of "Riverdance," creating a wide showcase 
of dances without losing the underlying 
element of Celtic music and dance. 

The Irish dance troupe may be the soul 
of the production, but it is the three 
African-American tappers who steal the 
audiences ' hearts. "Trading taps" is a 
scene in whi ch lrish dance meets equally 
fast jazz tap and the two forms get a 
chance to duel each other. ot one to let 
the Irish dance troupe steal the spotlight, 
African-American tappers Aaron Tolson, 
Ronald Bastine and Jason Bernard infuse 
hip, modern tap rather than straightfor-
ward Celtic tap. It's a fun, lively scene that 
manages to not only make fun of 
"Riverdance," but also gets the audiences 
into a charged atmosphere. 

The biggest flaw of the performance 
was something that the performers could 
not control : the minuet size of the Civic 
Theater. Wath a show grand in size and 
performance, the dancers sometime~ 
seemed preoccupied with not bumping

'40 Days' brings the need for abstinence in film-watching 
Plain plot doesn't add much to this attempt at a sex comedy with Josh Hartnett 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

Holl ywood is horny. Hollywood is so horny it will do anything to produce 
a movie abollt sex, including 
making a movie that concen-
trates on not having sex. The 
result is ridiculous. 

Josh Hartnett plays Matt 
Sullivan, a 20-something whose 
dot-com job looks like the set of 
"The Real World ." ullivan is 
de perately tryi ng to get over 
his ex-girlfriend Nicole (Vinessa 
Shaw). As a last resort, he takes 
a vow of abstinence for Lent. It's 
a horrible idea according to all 
of his male friends, including his 
priest-in-tra ining brother. 

Of course, Sullivan's trial is 
anything but easy. In his path 
lies love interest Erica (Shannyn 

ossamon), whom he can't sleep 

with. In addi tion, a large betting 
pool forms among Sullivan's co-
workers, who try everything to 
sabotage his progress. 

The movie brings a relative-
ly new angle to the "tirea-but-
true" teen-age sex movie, and 
Hartnett plays the haggard, sex-
deprived Sullivan well. 
Sullivan's transformatio n is 
painfully amusing as the days go 
on without any form of sexual 
contact. He goes from a daslting 
ladies' man to a twitching bun-
dle of nerves who has to douse 
himself with ice water in the 
morning. 

Besides pre enting audiences 
with the unique concept of being 
a sex movie with more talk than 
action, "40 Days" has a few 
redeeming qualities. Sullivan's 
hallucinations incorporate a lim-
i ted u e of animation, whieh con-
tributes to the lightheartedness

'Soldiers' breathes life into Vietnam heroes 
IWe Were Soldiers' portrays the lives of soldiers and their wives 
By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Staff Writer 

From the very first gun shot to the la st narrated words, "\Ne Were Soldiers" exemplifies the 
humanity and courage of those 
who fought and died in the battle at 
Ia Orang Valley in North Vietnam. 

Basing the movie on the book 
"We Were Soldiers Once ... and 
Young," director and producer 
Randall vValiace does a commend-
able job of turning the respected 
book into an equa ll y respectable 
film. 

Relating the experiences of the 
first platoon of the seventh cavalry 
regiment (eerily tile same regiment 
as that of General Custer) led by Lt. 
Moore (Mel Gibson) and Sergeant 
Major Plumley (Sam Elliott) , 
"Soldiers" tells the story of the men 
who fou ght in that battle and the 
people affected by it. \Vi th scenes of 
horrifi c violence contrasted with 
somber scenes of wives awaiting 
news, the lives of those involved are

Death cab For Cutie has a 
melodic indie-rock sound, but with 
some splashes of punk. They will 
be joined by Dismembennent 
Plan and Aveo at the Mira Mesa 
Epicentre. The event starts at 8 
pm. Call (858) 271-4000 for tick-
et information CD __ ~fri;.;.;..;daJ6..Y 

Regardless of what Mary J. 
Blige has been in her life, she 
has still been able to create qual-
ity, soulful tunes with a hip-hop 
flavor. She is guaranteed to put 
on a solid show at the Copley 
Symphony Hall. The concert 
starts at 8 p.m. and tickets start at 
$39.50. Look to page 9 for more 
on Blige. 

Being Frank Sinatra's god-
daughter isn't Nikka Costa's only 
claim to fame. This eclectic singer-
son!jWriter has tunes that can feel 
like Jazz and tracks that are more 
R&B. Costa will be at the Belly Up 

Tavem and the show starts at 9: 15 
p.m. Tickets are $12.

Celebrate the culture of hip-

Earl Warren College. The event 
will feature various performers, 
free food and free CDs. 
Admission to the event is also 
free. For more information call 
(858) 685-9490. 

A good chunk of San Diego 
music can be defined by the 
energetic rock-stylings of Rocket 
From the Crypt They will per-
form at the relatively new 18-

are $12 and the show starts at 
7:30 p.m. Check out

There is something about 
Ryan Adams' music that result-
ed in a sold-out show at 4th & B. 

Perhaps an examination into his 
rocking tune "New York New 
York" and his album "Gold" can 
reveal this highly infectious 
sound. For more on Adams

"Rolling Stone" magazine 

hailed Rufus Wainwright as the 
best new artist of 1998. In 2002, 
his altemative rock style with lush 
melodies and his dashing good 
looks have resulted in a large 
teen-age girl audience looking for 
a bit more substance in their 
music. Wainwright will be at the 
Belly Up Tavem at 8 p.m. Tickets 
are $22.

The resilient Mary J. Blige to perform in SO 
The 'Queen of Hip-Hop Soul' will grace Copley Hall this Friday 
By MATTHUEY 
Contributing Writer 

Leave it to Mary J . Blige to sam-ple the theme song from a daytime soap opera (specifical-
ly, from "The Young & the 
Restless") and create a hit in the 
process - this for the title track off 
her latest studio aibulll , "No More 
Drama." 

Following the bass-bumping 
tri umph of the LP's fi rst single, 
"Family Affair," Blige spent four 
weeks at the top of the si ngles 
chart. She has worked with Dr. 
Dre, Puff Daddy (pre-P. Diddy), 
Lauryn Hill , Aretha Franklin and 
Elton John. Her most recent sin-
gle, "Rainy Dayz," has already 
begun playing over the airwaves, 
along with the most recognizable 

Comedy: 
'40 Days' adds little to what 
moviegoers have already seen 
Continued from page 6 
attempts at comedic acting, "40 
Days" is fatally flawed . The script-
ed nature of the dialogue between

collaboration kid of the year, J a 
Rule; the video clip premieres this 
week. 

In her decade-long career, the 
soul -meets-street songstress has 
carved out an impressive niche in 
the recording industry. With 
approval both commercially and 
critically, Blige has five platinum 
albums to her credit, as well as a 
G rammy Award with Method Man 
in 1996 for Best Rap Performance 
by a Duo or Group. 

A main staple of urban and top 
40 stations, Blige has also long been 
in heavy rotation on MTV and 
B.E:r. 

Walking a path that crosses 
streetwise hip-hop and radio-
fri endly R&B, Blige has impres-
sively and consistently straddled 
the line between artist and enter-

ence's interest. Su llivan 's love-
interest, Erica , is grating when 
Sullivan's forced abstinence 
becomes a personal affront to her 
needs. Sossamon is clearly a new-
comer to the Hollywood scene: She 
apparently even neglected to hire a 
hair stylist. 

In all honesty, "40 Days" pre-
sents little that moviegoers haven't 
already seen. Whi le some of the 
laughs are deserved and Hartnett 

tainer. Her more recent work is a 
series of energized cuts in which 
the singer eschews the cutting, 
emotional grittiness that charac-
terized much of her previous 
work. 

When the native Ncw Yorker 
makes her San Diego appearance 
this week, it is one stop in a long list 
of national tour dates in support of 
her "N o More Drama" album. 

Despite her many accolades and 
veteran status in the music busi-
ness, detractors have often pointed 
out her habit of wandering off-key 
in live performances, favori ng 
melodrama over melody. It is this 
straightfo rward, no-emotions-
barred style that has contributed to 
her lasting success and her being 
dubbed the "Queen of Hip-Hop 
Soul." 

does well when sexually repressed, 
you can abstain from this one.

UCSD golf traveled to 
Bakersfield to take part in the 
Family Motors Invitational on 
Monday and Tuesday. In their third 
tournament of the season, the 
Tritons finished tied for seventh in 
the 15 -team field. 

The Tritons started slowly. 
They were one of six teams that 
failed to break 300 in the first 
round . Scoring 301 in the first 
round of the tournament placed 
UCSD ninth - 21 strokes behind 
the leading C hico State squad. 

The Tritons improved by five 
strokes after their second round, 
shooting a 296 for the sixth-best 
score on Monday. UCSD tallied 
296 again Tuesday to finish the 
tournament wi th an overall score of 
893 . 

Cal State Bakersfield won the 
tournament. Bakersfield 's com-
bined score of 855 edged Chico

more Galen Farris, completed the 
group of five Triton golfers. They 
finished in 39th, 47th and 67th 
respectivel y. 

The men's tennis team wasted 
no time securing its win over 
Sonoma State on Sunday, bringing 
its record to 8-0. 

The Tritons jumped out to a 3-
o lead against the Cossacks after 
sweeping the doubles.

Blake Wilson-Hayden teamed up 
for the first time and posted an 8-
3 win in the No.3 doubles posi-
tion, 

Sameer Chopra and Bryan 
Swatt played rheir usual No. I 
spot and scored an 8-5 victory, 
while the No. 2 team of Jeff 
Wil son and Everett Schroeter 
sealed the sweep with an 8-5 win . 

Sonoma State put up a better 
fight in the singles matches, but 
the Triton lineup stayed strong. 

Swart moved to the No. I SpOt 
for the day and even though he 
played tough, Sonoma's Mark 
Krz:yik pulled out the second-set 
tiebreaker to win in straight sets. 

Other notables were No. 5 
Doug Hoffman and No. 6 Sean 
Higginbotham. It was 
Higginbotham 's debut in the sin-
gles lineup. 

Both players won their match-

The ninth win of the year for 
men's tennis came Tuesday after-
noon when Point Loma Nazarene 
fell victim to the Tritons 7 -2. 

This time, the doubles squad 
did not sweep all the matches, but 
the No.2 and No. 3 positions of 
SchroeterlWilson and 
Meyer/Albrecht secured 8-2 and 
8-5 wins, respectively, to go into 
singles play with a 2-1 lead. 

All the singles positions except 
Chopra at No I recorded 
straight-set victories. 

Chopra battled with Point 
Loma's Rodrigo Suarez and lost, 
despite Chopra's victorious first 
set and a match point in the sec-
ond set. Suarez: prevailed in the 
long match, narrowly winning 6-
3,6-7, 10-7. 

After the match, Steidl mayer 
was thrilled with his team's efforts. 

"We played well today in near-
ly every match, and the one dou-
bles match where we were not 
doing well, we fought hard to 
come back," Steidlmayer said. "I 
think that every individual focused 
really well today,» 

This team has had some great 
wins this year, and are playing 
above par right now. Earlier in

UCSD has 
tough 
weekend 
Women's water 
polo goes 2 -2 
in SB tourney 
By JEFF CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

The UCS D wome n 's wa ter 
polo team hit the roau over the 
weekend for a tOurnament hosted 
bv UC Santa Ba rba ra. After a 
series of rough battles with top 
oppo nents, the Tritons came away 
with a 2-2 record for the tOurney 
and a 6-4 overall record heading 
into a nine-game homestand tart -
ing this week. 

In its first game of the weekend , 
UCS D faced a tOugh SanJo eState 
team. After stumbling out o f the 
gates earl y, the Tritons fell behind 
quickly and faced a 7- 1 defi cit at 
halfti me, eventua lly losing) 0-5. 

H ead coach Larry Sa nd ers was 
disappoi nted by h is team's perfor-
mance. 

" \Ve just came out real fl at," he 
said . "We were not connecting 
offensively or defensively." 

I loping to erase that loss from 
th eir minds, the Tritons then took 
on UC Irvine. O nce again, U CSD 
started off slowl y and fell behind 
4-0 a t the half. However, the team 
ra ll ied and tied the game at the 
end o f regul ation play with a 5-5 
score. 

It's been a male adage for years. There's no questioning the assumption; it has been shown 
countless times in countless sce-
narios, and stands among males as 
an irrefutable truth : Women and 
football don't mix. \Vhen guys 
think of football and women, the 
most common association tends to 
be the cheerleaders on the side-
lines. 

Well , heads up guys: These gals 
can play, too. 

The Women's American 
Football League capped off its 
inaugural season Feb. 24 with the 
league's first World Bowl held at 
Balboa Stadium in San Diego. 

The 16- team league kicked off 
last ovember, and culminated 
with a 30- 14 win by the Long 
Beach-based California Quakes 
over the Jacksonville Dixie Blues. 
Quake Quarterback Mary 
Montgomery threw 17 regular-
season touchdowns and led her 
team to victory by throwing for 
two touchdowns and I 10 yards. 
Dixie Blues' running back Rocky 
Brown rushed 29 times for 161 
yards and accounted for both of

the Jacksonville touchdowns. 
Most importantly, however, is 

the league, which was first envi-
sioned in a 26-team format, and 
was able to complete a tough inau-
gural season Sunday and prove to 
everyone and themselves that 
women can indeed hold their own 
on the football field . 

T he league basically uses the 

same rules as the ational 
Football League, playing on a reg-
ulation field with four IS-minute 
quarters with a )5-second play-
clock. 

The San Diego SunFire, the 
local WAFL team, was voted to 
host the World Bowl I by the 
league after finishing the season 
with the highest attendance, aver-

aging 2,400 fans per home game 
despite its record of 5-5. 

However, the league struggled 
in its first year, as the top-finish-
ing Quakes saw an average atten-
dance of fewer than 500 fans . 
Most players were unpaid and 
were forced to buy their own 
equipment, with the only team 
funds coming from a few spon-
sorships and ticket sales. 

The SunFires are owned by 
Donna Fox, a former sports 
anchor who also plays running 
back for the San Diego team. 
Teammate Christina Suggett also 
pulls double-duty, serving as direc-
tor of marketi ng and business 
development. 

The women on the team range 
from the 5 -foot-4-inch, 118-
pound Fox to the 5-foot-8-inch 
250-pound offen sive lineman 
Michelle "Big Red" Bryant. 

Now that the season has ended, 
many of the athletes will be partic-
ipating in the San Diego SunFire 
Women 's Flag Football League 
beginning March 2. Tryouts for 
next year 's team will be held March 
16 at Morley Field in Balboa Park. 

Seni or Courtney Hemmerly 
kept the Tritons alive with a clutch 
goa l wi th about five seconds left to 
play, and finished with three goals 
in the Antea ters' 7 -5 overtime loss. 
Junio r Samara Silverman added six 
stea ls in the victory. 

Sanders was impressed by his 
team 's comeback. 

"It was good to see they could 
come back from that kind of situa-
tion," he sa id .

of the cage until the Gauchos 
scored wi th 5 seconds left, break-
ing the Tri tons' hearts in the 
process. Even in defeat, however, 
UCS D pulled ome positives out 
of the result. 

"We played a good, solid game," 
Sanders said. "We had plenty of 
opportunities and unfortunately 
the luck was on their side."

In a rare weeknight doublehead-
er, the UCSD softball team split 
with the Cougars of Azusa Pacific 
U niversity. The Tritons lost a pitch-
ers duel 1-0 in the opener, but came 
back to win the nightcap 8-2 . . 

T he Cougars' Cassie Lakey and 
J amie orman opened the game 

with back-to-back doubles, and 
before the Tritons could record an 
out, Azusa Pacific led I-D. 

UCSD pitcher Leea Harlan 
struggled through the rest of the 
inning, surrendcring two more 
hits, but eventually got a third 
strike to strand Cougar runners on 
second and thi rd and prevent fur-
ther scoring.

harmless by Megan Alkire when 
she pitched a solid outing, allow-
ing only five hits and no walks. 
UCSD mounted its only serious 
threat of the game in the bottom 
of the third inning when Breanne 
Cope and Amy Mettee led off with 
back-to-back si ngles. 

After Kim Aggabao laid down a 
sacrifice bunt, the Tritons had 
runners at second and third with 
only one out. However, Alkire was 
up to the challenge and she 
induced a shallow fly to left field 
and a ground ball back to the 
mound to end the threat. 

Harlan was also strong after the 
first inning, allowing only three 
hits the rest of the way, but she 
picked up the loss, dropping her 
record to 6-2 on the year. 

Game two started the same way, 
with the Cougars picking up a sin-
gle run in the top of the first inning. 

The Tritons atoned for their 
early mistake in the bottom of the 
second inning when Kristin 
Hunstad and Jamie Hurst got on 
base for Mettee, who ripped a two-
run triple to right field . 

"In the second game, we knew 
what we were up against," Mettee 
said. "We had to come back and 
show them how we play softbalL" 

The Triton brand of softball 
picked up another run in the third 

inning by capitalizing on two 
Cougar errors to take a 3-1 lead. 
However, Azusa Pacific's bad defen-
sive inning in the third paled in 
comparison to the trouble it had in 
the fifth. Kristina Anderson 
opened the inning by hitting a ball 
to the shortstop that the Cougar 
Rachel Alkire could not handle. 

With one out, Christi 
Martinelli drove another ball at 
Alkire; this one went through the 
shortstop's legs and all the way to 
the wall for a three-base error. 

After Cope walked , Mettee 
came up with her second two-run 
hit of the day, this one a double 
into the right-center gap. Two bat-
ters later, Mettee scored on yet 
another Cougar error. In all, the 
Tritons scored five runs on only 
two hits with the help of three 
errors by APU. 

The Cougars added a run in 
the top of the sixth on a long home 
run by Lorna Lyttle to close the 
scoring at 8-2 in favor ofUCSD. 

"We made the adjustments we 
needed to make," Mettee said 
about the difference between the 
two games. "We played as a team 
and played our game." 

The Tritons look to maintain 
their excellent level of play on the 
road against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills and Cal State Bakersfield.
