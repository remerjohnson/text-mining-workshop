Students protest fee hikes 
Coalition holds rally against budget cuts 

Mulloy Morrow/Guardian 
Student voices: Thurgood Marshall College junior Jon Lego partakes in a rally 
against Gov. Schwarzenegger's proposed cuts to higher education on Feb. 17. 

By SOFIA MARIN Nandagopal, A.S. vice president 
Staff Writer external, approximately 250 people 

UCSD students, faculty, staff 
and community members rallied in ' 
protest of Gov. Arn'old 
Schwarzenegger's proposed cuts to 
higher education on Feb. 17. The 
rally began at noon at Price Center 
Plaza, followed by a march to the 
Chancellor's Complex. 

attended the hour-long rally. 
The rally was organized by the 

UCSD Coalition to Stop the Cuts, 
which includes members of the A.S. 
Council, the California Student 
Public Interest Research Group, 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan, Students for Economic 
Justice, Associated Student 

According to Harish Employees-United Auto Workers 

Local 2865, the Graduate Student 
Association and others. 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W . Watson said he 
supported the rally. 

"I am particularly concerned that 
some budget proposals target the 
low-income students, and I think 
this is a major step backward for the 
university," Watson said. "I am hop-
ing that this can be reversed." 

Speakers from labor unions, fac-
ulty, student government organiza-
tions and minority support services 
addressed the budget proposal and 
its consequences. 

"Raising the fees on grad stu-
dents is foolhardy; it won't raise 
revenue, it will only limit access, 
and it will hurt the state," graduate 
student speaker Lee Lovejoy said. 
"We need to send a strong message 
to the governor and legislators and 
to the voters as well, who may not 
all be educated on these issues." 

According to Nandagopal, the 
A.S. External Affairs Office helped 
provide the resources for the rally 
to take place. 

"We JUSt want people in the 
community of San Diego to know 
what the issues are," Nandagopal 
said. "We're going to mobilize stu-
dents throughout the state of 
California to fight against fee 
increases and outreach cuts." 

Speakers and attendees expressed 
their concerns with the governor's 
proposed tuition increases and fund-
ing cuts, which include a 10 percent 
fee increase for in-state undergradu-
ate students and a 40 percent fee 
increase for graduate students. 
These hikes would bring the average 
undergraduate tuition fee up to 
$6,020 and the average graduate fee

Publisher responds to demands 
Thomson launches cheaper textbook initiative 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

Major college textbook publish-

recently launched two initiatives to 
offer lower prices for selected text-
booles and provide digital versions 

of popular texts. 
The California Student Public

Professor sp'eaks on history 

of scientific consensus 
UCSD history professor Naomi Oreskes will 

discuss whether present scientific methods are 
correct in a free lecture on Feb. 26. The lecture, 
called "Consensus in science: How do we know 
we're not wrong?" will also feature professor 
Richard Somerville of the climate research divi-
sion at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
Oreskes and Somerville will discuss how past 
historians, philosophers and sci~ntists have tried 
to find answers to the questions surrounding 
current consensus. The lecture will also focus on 
cases in the history of science where prior con-
sensus had been wrong. Oreskes cites the 
notion of continental drift and how it was not 
accepted in the beginning of the century 
because of a model during the time that made 
the theory impossible. The event which is free 
and open to the public, will be held at Peterson 
tjall 110 at 7:30 p.m. 

Oreskes previously gave a similar talk for the 
George Sarton Award Lecture at the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science 
annual meeting on Feb. 13. She spoke about 
possible alternate scientific methods and 
whether they should be considered. 

UCSD to offer SAT prep 
class, admission~ workshop 

UCSD will offer the Preliminary Scholastic 
Aptitude Test to high school students on March 
13 and free workShops on college admissions 
for parents. High school students will be able to 
take the PSAT at Center Hall from 8 a.m. to 
11 :30 a.m. In addition, parents will be able to 
attend free workshops to learn more about 
admission requirements for UC and California 
State University systems, as well as other factors 
that will affect high school students entering col-
lege in 2006. Financial aid and scholarship 
information will also be available. The workshop 
will be held concurrently with the PSAT. 

The event is sponsored by UCSO's Early 
Academic Outreach Program and the Princeton 
Review.

than previous reports. According to the study 
conducted by physicians from UCSD School of 
Medicine, there was a 1.26 percent HIV infec-
tion rate among 947 women in labor tested in 
the past year. Previous studies had found infec-
tion among only .09 percent of pregnant 
women. 

The study found that 96.7 percent of women 
in labor were willing to undergo HIV counseling 
and rapid-result testlng. If a woman was found to 
be HIV positive, the research team helped pro-
vide her with the drug zidovudine and advised 
her against breast feeding. Children were then 
given the drug for six weeks and given follow-up 
tests during their first four months. 

Researchers also found that HIV infection in 
women and children in Mexico has effects on 
the San Diego community. The Tijuana/San 
Diego border sees more than 131 ,000 legal 
crossings daily, and many of those who cross the 
border frequently seek medical care in the 
United States, according to the researchers. The 
UCSD Mother, Child and Adolescent HIV 
Program has provided medical care to pregnant 
women, children and teens for the past 15 years. 
The program has also provided prenatal coun-
seling. care and testing at Tijuana General 
Hospital. H IV specialists also prCNIde patient and 
community education through the program. 

Nikkei sponsors Day of 
Remembrance on Feb. 19 
Nikkei Student Union at UCSO will hold an 

event called Day of Remembrance in memo-
ry of the Japanese American intemment in 
World War II on Feb. 19. The event commem-
orates the signing of Executive Order 9066 on 
Feb. 19, 1941 , resulting in approximately 
120,000 people of Japanese ancestry being 
forced into camps. The event will feature 
speakers in addition to pictures, artifacts and 
personal accounts from the camps. Political 
science professor Peter Irons will be present 
as a guest speaker. 

Irons is a practicing civil rights and liberties 
attorney and was the lead counsel in the 
19805 in cases to reverse criminal convictions 
of Japanese Americans who challenged reloca-
tion orders during World War II. George Wakji, 
president of the Ventura County chapter of the 
Japanese American Citizens League, will also 
share his experience as an activist and former 
internee at the Gila River Relocation Center in 
Arizona. 

The event will take place at Price Center 
plaza from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

I-A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
Meeting'20 

February 18, 2004 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
[temA 

The A.S. Council approved the appoint-
ment of new Earl Warren College Interim 
Junior Senator Everly Mariano to the 
Internal Committee by consensus. 

Reports 
Vice President Academic Affairs Todd 
Tolin 

Tolin reponed that the constitutional 
amendment to change the commissioner of 
academic affairs to a vice presidential posi-
tion was ratified following approval by four 
college councils. 

Commissioner of Athletic Relations 
Jordan Cross 

Cross reported that UCSD's baseball 
team was the only Division II team invited 
to participate in the Aztec Invitational on 
March 12 at the new PETCO Parle.. 

Student Affinnative Action Coalition 
representative Daniel Gonzales 

Gonzales reported that SAAC, in coop-
eration with the A.S. Senate and other orga-

nizations, will spearhead a program to deliv-
er thousands of postcards to the UC 
Regents. 

The postcards will express disapproval of 
. the Board of Regents' decision to meet at 
campuses that have no undergraduate popu-
lations as well as urge the governing body 
not to further increase student fees, accord-
ing to Gonzales. 

Old Business 
Item A 

The council approved a resolution in 
support of California public higher educa-
tion by consensus. The resolution calls upon 
state officials "to maintain a strong commit-
ment to California's colleges and universities 

. and provide the necessary means to preserve 
excellence in public higher education." 

Item E 
The council returned' legislation that 

would have reallocated $3,000 of unexpect-
ed revenue from the A.S. MicroFridge 
rental service to the Students of Color 
Conference back to the finance committee. 

Debate also centered on the necessity of 
suspending a bylaw that requires a $75,000 
reserve for income accounts. Currently, 
reserves do not meet the minimum.

said "We would take them to task with a 
citation if they're not able to produce the 
report." 

For state universities, the government 
plays a smaller role, depending on the type 
of agreement made between the campus and 
county officials. Some give the enforcement 
authority to the county, while others opt for 
joi nt-inspection agreements, Pong said. 

In the case of UCSD, however, the uni-
versity, which runs many of the dining facil-
ities, is also the agency that inspects them. 
The county leaves all inspection and gov-
erning responsibilities to EH&S, according 
to Liz Quaranta, chair of the Food and 
Housing Division at San Diego County 
Deparonent of Environmental Health, 

"We have an advantage over the county 
in that we have around 47 facilities here on 
campus to inspect, and we can do them four 
times a year," Bowers said. "The county, 
they try to get out there and hit theirs once 

a year, and I can say that they probably don't 
hit every facility here in San Diego." 

Bowers said that UCSD's inspection sys-
tem is beneficial to the campus. 

"Our advantage is that we have more per-
sonnel per establishment here, so we're able 
to better individually oversee our facilities 
here," he said. "They get inspected more 
often [and) get more individual attention." 

Bowers said that he notified aU facilities of 
the law and gave them the required patron 
notices ~o post. He also said he plans to reem-
phasize to restaurant managers the impor-
tance of maintaining a copy of their repon on 
the premises, though he said the issue is not a 
major concern for the department. 

"What I've been hammering on them is 
things like food temperature, sanitation, 
things that can cause food-borne iUnesses," 
he said. "When they get all that stuff into 
shape, I'll ask them if they have a copy."

Books: CalPIRG calls 
initiatives a good 'first step' 

"We had missed that one area," 
Plaza Cafe Ieitchen manager 
Roben Ayala said. "But that's a 
common thing that happens." 

Muir Woods Coffee Shop and 
the Middle of Muir convenience 
store claimed the lowest ranking 
of any campus eatery with an aver-
age score of 91. Evidence of 
rodent and insect infestation were 
among the violations. However, a 
Feb. 10 inspection report revealed 
that the animal problems have 
been corrected. 

Common violations at other 
on-campus food vendors included 
improper refrigeration and hold-
ing temperatures, expired prod-
ucts, dirty floors and unrestrained 
carbon dioxide canisters. 

Some students said they have 
experienced at least one situation 
in a dining facility that made them 
uncomfortable. 

"I remember at ovr once, I 
had a pre-made sandwich and 
when I opened it up, it was covered 
with mold," John Muir College 
sophomore Renee Chow said. 

Ocean View Terrace lost points 
during a recent inspection for pizza 
and chicken held below the required 
temperarure, sandwich meats stored 
ten degrees above the minimwn 
temperarure, two dozen containers . 
of expired milk and uncovered raw 
chicken in the refrigerator. 

Steve Pfingst, food service 
manager at OceanView Terrace, 
said that the inspection report is a 
snapshot in .time. 

"We have, at any given time, 
probably over 100 different items 
once we're set up and going," 
Pfingst said. "Out of those hun-
dred, [the inspector) isolated two 
that did not meet the specific 

requirements, and then we go 
around correcting that" 

Anthea Klein, manager of 
Sierra Summit and EI Mercado, 
reported that incidents of mold on 
the dishroom ceiling and raw meat 
being stacked over ready-to-serve 
pasta have been corrected. 

"When the reports come in, we 
all sit down and we split up who's 
taking care. of what, and then we 
take care of it inunediately," Klein 
said. 

Scores for Price Center restau-
rants ranged from 94 to 98. 

Star Wraps received the lowest 
score due to the kitchen floor and 
wall needing replacement, sauces 
in the refrigerator held above the 
required temperature, pans stored 
on the floor of the walk-in refrig-
erator and meat found defrosting 
at room temperature. 

"We put in wann sauce inside 
the refrigerator, so it overworlced 
the refrigerator," Star Wraps man-

ager Damon Woo said "That was 
frozen meat; it was still frozen." 

Panda Express received an aver-
age score of 97. The restaurant lost 
points for vegetables stored in a 
refrigerator at nine degrees above 
the maximum temperature, an 
electrical ourlet in need of repair 
and a fire extinguisher that was not 
properly mounted. 

Dirty knives found in a knife 
rack at Rubio's lowered that 
eatery's average score to 98. 

The inspection report for 
Poner's Pub revealed mold grow-
ing on the outside of the beer lines 
in the walk-in refrigerator. 

"Since [the inspection), we've 
redone all of our taps, which also 
means that they've redone all of 
the lines," Poner's Pub manager

demand, about giving our customer 
what they're asking for and giving 
them a choice," Gaber said. 

CaiPIRG reported in "Rip-off 
101 : How the CWTent Practices of 
the Publishing Industry Drive up the 
Cost of College Textbooks" that 
publishing companies such as 
Thomson Learning constanrly 
release new versions of books with 
very little differences from the older 
version, and combine textbooks with 
additional items that the majority of 
students and professors do not use. 

"Constanrly released new edi-
tions in the market makes it hard to 
sell books bacle and to find used 
books for a cheaper price," Reents 
said. "Although it's great that one of 
the biggest publishing companies is 
offering alternatives to textbooks, 
there's definitely more to be done." 

Instructors who adopt an 
Advantage Series textbook would 
allow students to buy compact edi-
tions and unbounded versions of the 
full-color textbook. The Advantage 
Series currencly fearures 25 books. 

Promotions through Digital 
Discounts allow students to access 
learning tools and tutorials on the 
Web. Books included in the two 
initiatives are in the disciplines of 
humanities, behavioral and social 
sciences, sciences and mathematics. 

Mathematics professor Gaemus 
Collins said he is willing to sign on 
the Advantage Series. He added 
that other professors he has talked 
to would also use the new series. 

"I certainly support that," 
Collins said. "The faculty that I've 
talked to definitely side with stu-
dents and not with the company, 
and I think [the faculty) would pre-
fer that the books not cost as much."

According to Gaber, the initia-
tives have been in the works since 
last year. 

"We've offered books like 
Advantage in the past, but typically 
instructors opt for the 'fully loaded' 
top-quality textbooks," Gaber said. 

The CalPIRG report had used 
the Thomson Learning. published 
boole "Calculus - Early 
Transcendentals" as an example of 
how. bundling can make textbook 
prices higher. According to the 
report, the new edition of the boole 
cost $131 with bundling and few 
changes in the math probl ems, 
while a used version cost $20 to 
$90. However, "Calculus - Early 
Transcendentals" has not been 
added to the Advantage Series list. 

According to Collins, who uses 
the boole for his class, an alternative 
would not malee a difference in how 
students learn the material. 

"Books don't need to be that 
expensive, and students can learn 
from old calculus books if they have 
to," he said. "The expense is not 
necessary in learning." 

More textbooks are expected to 
be added to the Advantage Series 
list, Gaber said. 

According to Reents, the initia-
tives have not been established long 
enough to know whether instruc-
tors will sign up to have the options 
available for their students. 

"We found that the math facul-
ty is the most supportive in this 
effort to lower prices," Reents said. 

According to Gaber, texts are also 
available online, but many instruc-
tors opt to have printed textbooks. 

"While advanced online solu-
tions are available, the printed text-
book is still most often the core-
learning tool," Gaber said .

Report reveals 
Wal--Mart's misdeeds 

Wal-Mart's low prices are misleading in light of the amount 
Americans end up J?aying in 
taxes to help subsIdIze the 
retailer's low-paid and 
under-insured employees, a 
congressional study released 
Feb. 16 said. 

The report, released by 
Democrats on the House 
Committee on Education 
and the Workforce, esti-
mates Wal-Mart's practices 
cost taxpayers nearly $1.3 
billion annually in medical 
care, housing assistance and 
Title I education costs. 
Employees must tap into 
these resources, e\'en during 
full-time employment, in 
order to survive. 

While Wal-Mart touts its 
low prices, the company's 
presence in the American 
economy has a devastating 
effect. Store employees earn 
substandard wages and as a 
result draw upon govern-
ment resources. All attempts 
to unionize workers are 
quelled and Wal-Mart con-
stantly faces multiple unfair 
labor practice allegations in 
court. 

U.S. manufacturers are 

pressured to lower their 
prices to compete for Wal-
Mart contracts, which 
results in production jobs 
lost overseas. 

Competitors lose market 
share as Wal-Mart's low 
prices attract more cus-
tomers. Other businesses 
slash their employee benefits 
to compete Wlth Wal-Mart's 
rock-bOttom prices. The five 
month-long labor dispute 
between local grocery diains 
and the United Food and 
Commercial Workers union 
is a prime example - the 
prospects of Wal-Mart 
Superstores entermg 
Southern California can be 
potentially crippling if the 
grocery chains don't slash 
employee costs in order to 
lower prices. 

Wal-Mart's methods 
must not be the model for 
U.S. labor practices. Every 
working family must be able 
to achieve a standard of liv-
ing where housin~, health 
care and educatIon are 
attainable by working alone. 
Reversing the race toward 
lower wages and fewer 
decent jobs must be a greater 
priority for lawmakers. 

D.C. school voucher 
program must go 

On Feb. 13, President Bush voiced support for the first federally 
funded school voucher 
program, which will give 
public school students in 
Washington, D.C. th~ 
opportunity to use govern-
ment dollars to attend 
local I?rivate schools. The 
initiative was approved as 
part of a delayed 2004 
budget bill. 

The vouchers will be 
worth up to $7,500 each 
and giveh to at Least 1,700 
e1igi5le students. 

Supporters claim that 
competition with private 
schools will spurn public 
schools to raise standards, 
provide accountability and 
make a private-school edu-
cation available to low-
income students. They 
argue that vouchers will not 
hurt public schools finan-
cially because they will still 

receive the same funding-
per-student. 

While it seems like a 
voucher program might 
improve standards, it 
would actually hurt most 
students. Vouchers will 
undermine public schools, 
which do not have the 
means to improve on the 
principle of competition . . 
Regardless of per-student 
funding, programs will be 
cut and teachers fired due 
to the loss of students, 
resulting in a weakened 
education for those left 
behind. 

Instead of securing 
funds for vouchers, Bush 
should use the funding to 
improve the struggling 
public schools in 
Washington, D.C., chan-
neling money into teacher 
and staff development, 
after-school programs and 
up-to-date supplies.

â€¢ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Naive portrayal of 

Jewish friend unfair 
Editor: 

I find Claire J . Vannette's 
Feb. 9 column, "Distant conflict 
hits home with local traditions," 
very one-sided and naive on the 
part of the author. In her piece, 
Vannette describes how her 
mother's Jewish friend wrote an 
e-mail denouncing terrorist 
attacks committed by Muslim 
terrorists. Vannette is outraged 
not by the terrorist attacks, but 
by the friend who wrote this e-
mail, indirectly blaming the 
Jewish friend for being angry at 
terrorists that killed Americans. 

I find it very offensive how 
Vannette portrays her Jewish 
friend in a negative light, as if 
she was the terrorist. Vannette 
fails to point out the negative 
impact of the terrorist attacks on 
the victims. Nor does she note 
the anti-American hatred that 
Palestinians exhibited in the 
West Banle streets by dancing 
and celebrating after thousands 
of Americans perished on 9/11. 
Nor does she note that nearly 70 
percent of Palestinians support 
suicide bombings and that 50 
percent want to see the complete 
obliteration of Israel 
(bttp :llfttwr.bbc.co.uklllbi/world! 
middJUllnl20728) l.stm). 

Vannette only encourages 
anti-Semitism on campus that is 
increasing with the "secret ten-
sion on campus between Jewish 
and Muslim groups" by noting a 
case in which a Jewish woman 

was upset at terrorism. Next 
time, Vannette should talee the 
time to research the subject and 
find that some Muslims do not 
have a favorable view of 
Americans or Jews.

Racism's lelaC! still 
haunts Amenca 

Editor: 
In response to Chris Taylor's 

Feb. 4 column, I believe that 
American values are something 
to be proud of, especially the 
belief that all AmericalUl should 
have equal opportunities, 

regardless of their religion or the 
color of their skin. 

Taylor argues that people 
should be "color-blind," ignor-
ing race and .treating everyone 
the same. If this had been our 
nation's policy since inception, 
"color-blindness" would pose no 
problems. However, America has 
been far from ideal, boasting a 
long and brutal history of con-
quest and slavery. Today, many 
Americans hold that. racism is no 
longer a .problem, perhaps 
because overt racism has faded 
from the public's imagination. 

Unfortunately, the legacy of 
racism still haunts the lives of 
individual Americans. In a sense, 
racism has become "institution-
alized" through the long 
sequence of oppressive actions 
against blacks and other minori-
ties including hate speech, hiring 
discrimination, housing discrim-
.ination and economic policy 
biased against them. Today, 
blacks and Latinos are overrep-
resented in impoverished ghet-
tos, where their schools receive 
inadequate funding and the 
streets are unsafe. 

For these individuals, chances 
of escaping a grim future of 
poverty or crime are slim. 
Whose fault is this? Unless 
you're willing to put forth an 
archaic Social Darwinist argu-
ment about how minorities are 
inferior or "lazy," the apparent 
answer is a legacy of racism.

Positive attitudes always welcome 
A little kindness can go a long way 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

Last year I was standing in line at Price Center's post office waiting to buy a 
stamp. The line was ridiculously 
long, as always, and I was going to 
be late to class. The guy in front 
of me noticed my anguish and 
asked, "You in a hurry?" I told him 
my dilemma. He nodded empa-
thetically and disappeared into the 
post office. Maybe he was just 
going in there to aslc how long it 
was going to talce. He walked 
through the door with two stamps 
in hand. "Here's one for you," he 
said. Surprised by his thoughtful-
ness, I fumbled in my backpack 
for some change to pay for it. 
"Don't worry about it," he said, 
and walked away. 

Simple act, but a long-term 
impact. For that one brief 
moment, I shed my thick shell of 
cynicism and succumbed to the 
soft surface of genuine kindness . . 

It may come as second nature 
to condemn an idea or rip some-
one to shreds, to tell off an incom-
petent driver or slam a teaching 
assistant. H_ow simple is it to com-
plain about a professor and make 
fun of everything lie or she does? 
There is a self-indulgent, mind-
less, offhand quality to venting or 
gossiping about someone. Being 
negative is, for us all, a natural 
disposition. 

On a national level, negative 
campaign ads and comments are 
usually the order of the day. On 
the other hand, we tend to associ-
ate kindness with images of 
Mother Theresa and orphaned 
chi ldren - the form of sacrifice 
embodied in an elderly woman 
who represents the exception, not 
the norm . Tn a societal climate 
marred by divisive issues and 
moral debate Oanet Jackson, any-
one?), it feels like a little positive 
thinking would be a relief. 

Maybe it's a mid-college crisis 
settling on me, but for some rea-
son, I've recently realized the 
transient nature of our stay here. 
Four or fi ve years seems like an 
awful long time on paper, but will 

anyone disagree with me that it 
flies by? Like an early morning 
mist that seems to be everywhere, 
the college experience immerses 
us only to disappear when we are 
just beginning to assess it. It is this 
sense of urgency that has allowed 
me to reflect on the rela ti ve 
importance of my time at UCSD. 
Will I remember the many 
midterm exams? The pages and 
pages of never-ending textbooks? 
I hope not. 
- What I do hope to remember 
are post-office moments. We've all 
heard it a million times from grade-
school teachers to "Chicken Soup 
for the Soul" to the movie "Pay It 
Forward." Random acts oflcindness 
brighten everyone~ day. Fine, but 
don't veer off into cliche territoty, 
now. But really, in college, where 
we make so many new friends and 

" Anybody can tear 
someone down, but 

to inject a bit of 
sunshine into a life is 

a greater 
accomplishment. ), 

are surrounded by so many people, 
opportuni ties to build one another 
up abound. What I personally 
appreciate are the pleasant conver-
sations I have with my roommate 
after a long day, seeing someone 
offer his or her seat on the shuttle, 
reading a note of encouragement 
my friend wrote, or watching a stu-
dent carrying an older person's gro-
ceries. The regular mix of lecture, 
work and activities produces far 
more value when human relation-
ships are built and nurtured. 

I also have realized that the 
structure of society is built upon 
the intangibles. Diplomacy is basi-
cally a matter of tact and mutual 
understanding. The "people skills" 
and "team-player attitude" employ-
ers so often desire resemble the 
same kindness, consideration and 
interaction fostered on the play-
ground. 

I find that as young adults, we 
are often characterized in the 
media, entertainment and author-

ities' minds as reckless and rude, 
disrespectful and uncouth. 

I propose a challenge to all col-
lege students. Let's prove them 
wrong. It's a piece of cake to gos-
sip about others or to curse pro-
fessors to death behind their 
backs. It's another thing altogeth-
er to encourage one another. 
There is, however, no better time 
to do this than in the setting we 
are in right now. 

The potential to become hard-
ened, jaded and bitter individuals 
must be decreased somehow if at 
this young age we all just spare 
each other a smile once in a while. 
I speak from personal experience 
here. When all I do is dwell in 
self-pity over my poor exam 
grades, it shows on my face. 
When something annoys me, I 
complain to everyone. When I 
feel that an injustice is being done 
to me, I sour at the thought of 
taking the energy to be friendly to 
a stranger. If I'm not happy at the 
moment, why should anyone else 
be? If the impact of such a nega-
tive attitude permeates into a visi-
ble expression, then doesn't the 
same go for a positive attitude? 

This isn't to make light of the 
very real inadequacies and prob-
lems on the campus, local, nation-
al and international levels that 
surround us. Nor is this an 
attempt to make everyone into 
plastic-smile phonies. Dissension 
and disagreements, along the neg-
ative sphere, are healthy ways to 
evaluate the status quo. Alii advo-
cate is an effective way of wielding 
the power we as individuals hold. 

Anybody can tear someone 
down, but to inject a bit of sunshine 
into a life is a greater accomplish-
ment. Whether this is made 
through encouraging a friend or 
professor, picking up a pencil for a 
stranger, or, yes, just buying a 
stamp for a person in line, positive 
thinking and kindness can be 
refreshing. Even just a smile is 
worthwhile. I saw a bumper sticker 
that said, "Smile. It confuses peo-
ple." In comparison to all the nega-
tive energy that accumulates at the 
end of a tough day, confusion in 
this case just might be a welcome 
sentiment.

Letters: Minorities are reminded daily of race 
continued from page 4 

In a country that believes that 
opportunity should not be tied to 
one's race, it is clear that 
Americans have a responsibility to 
rectify this injustice. Thus, there 
is an absolute need to consider 
race and its implications, even 
with your friends . If you don't, 
and claim "color-blindness," you 
are inadvertently supporting these 
institutions of racism. 

Taylor speaks of his best 
friends, Diu and Suarez, who he 
never placed in racial categories. 
Presumably race wasn't an issue 
for them, or they would have spo-
ken to him about it. Perhaps they 
were never exposed to racism or 
discrimination. This does not 
make them "white-washed," but 
there are a great deal of minorities 
in America who are very aware of 
their race, who are reminded 
every day when they take the bus 
from the Barrio Logan to La Jolla 
where they work. The contrast in 
opportunities is appalling. 

Steps must be taken to "level 
the playing field ." Right now 
whites continue to profit from 

advantages over minorities, 
whether you have racist thoughts 
or not. Perhaps this is one reason 
why hostility is sometimes direct-

" there are a great deal

Barrio Logan to 
La Jolla"." 
-DMl~John"" CoIeP junior 

ed at whites, in ~.z FranttriZll or 
the Nt'W lftdiclltur, out of frustra-
tion. That does not make it right, 
or by any means helpful to any 

party. 
As far as "diversity" goes, it is a 

shame that some cultural clubs on 
campus aren't very welcoming to 
the general student body, but 
some are, and students should 
realize that their purpose is to 
preserve their cultural heritage, 
and not necessarily to reject 
whites. 

Yes, there is no offici al "whi te 
. club" on campus. Why would we 
need one? Go to the mall, go to 
the movies, go anywhere and you 
will find white American culture. 
We could create a club. It might 
even be a great idea, if along with 
the contributions of white 
Americans we remembered our 
long history of oppressing other 
peoples. 

Race is an emotionally charged 
topic, fraught with taboo, and 
communication is broken down 
reI a tively easily. Extremists from 
the left and from the right often 
confuse the issues, which is why 
it's best to Iceep an open mind.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2004 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Rally: Speakers address budget issues 
continued from page J 

up to $8,926 for the 2004-05 acad-
emicyear. 

Patricle. Velasquez, direcror of 
the Office of Academic Suppon 
and Instructional Services, voiced 
his opinion regarding the proposal 
for the complete elimination of all 
K -12 outreach programs and the 
potential decreases in financial aid. 

"[The budget proposals) wiJI 
mean that we'll see fewer under-
represented students of color, 
we'll see fewer working-class stu-
dents on this campus, and that 
huns the education of all students 
here at UCSD," Velasquez said. 

Other speakers focused on the 
impact of public policy on the 
state's economic development. 

"It's bad policy to burden edu-
cation," Tony Valladolid, direcror 
of Student Legal Services, said. 

"Futuristically, we won't have the 
highly-educated, skilled worker 
that [is) necessary for a robust 
economy." 

Mter a series of speakers, 
Nandagopal announced that 
attendees could join in a march to 
the Chancellor's Complex, where 
students voiced their demands 
and concerns over a megaphone. 

"We are having a nlly to 
announce our presence to the 
chancellor, the Regents and to the 
legislators," Joshua Wilson of 
Students for EconomicJustice said. 

According to Wilson, the UC 
Board of Regents and UC 
President Roben C. Dynes are on 
the students' side. He said, howev-
er, that he and other students want 
to make certain that the UC offi-
cials do not comply with 
Schwarzenegger's proposal. 

Schwarzenegger has also pro-
posed a cut of five percent, or 
$35.3 million, in spending on fac-
ulty, decreasing the 19.7:1 student-
faculty ratio to a ratio of 20.7:1. 

"I can speak from personal 
experience that [the proposed bud-
get] has made it harder to find lec-
turer positions," lecturer John 
Brady said. "Next year it's not clear 
that I can come back to UCSD." 

UCSD Coalition to Stop the 
Cuts members said they hope to 
organize and mobilize students at 
other UC campuses, the 
California State University sys-
tem and the community colleges. 

"It's relevant to talk about these 
issues because [the budget cuts 
are] going to affect all of us," said 
graduate student Irmary Reyes-
Santos, a member of the UCSD 
Coalition to Stop the Cuts. 

Reports: UCSD to develop grading system 
contin ued {rom page :l 

While all four Peabodys loca-
tions had notices telling customers 
that a repon was available, employ-
ees said they did not have j.t. 
Manager Bob Marquis said he was 
not aware of the legal requirement. 

"I've read the signs a million 
times, but I didn't know what they 
were talking about," he said. 

Though Bowers said UCSD's 
environmental health program 
mirrors that of the county, EH&S 
has not yet begun using the same 
format for inspection reports stan-
dardized by the state. The same 
law that Â· made the reports avail-
able to the public also mandated 
that health agencies begin using a 
new uniform reporting method by 
2002, a deadline with which the 
university has not complied. 

The current inspection fonnat, 

based on a lOO-point scale, awards 
food establishments points for 
ranging from Iight-colored walls 
and ceilings to proper food temper-
atures and employee hygiene. It 
does not evaluate whether food is 
cooked adequately or comes from a 
safe source, two categories mandat-
ed by the revised health code. 

The new law also requires 
inspectors to distinguish between 
"major" and "minor" violations, 
something that Bowers said EH&S 
already does by deducting more 
points for more serious offenses. 

However, inspection records 
show that Star Wraps lost three 
points during its most recent 
inspection for sauce stored at 49 
degrees, a minor violation under 
state guidelines. At the 'same time, 
Round Table Pizza lost two points 
for chicken found at 55 degrees, 

considered a major violation by 
the state. Health laws require all 
perishable foods to be kept below 
41 degrees. 

Bowers said that the university 
had hired a new contractor to 
develop a new inspection scheme 
and a grade system similar to the 
one used by the county, but that he 
resigned in the fall. EH&S is cur-
rently looking for a replacement. 

"We want to get a grading sys-
tem down, and we want to get all 
of our grading criteria forms up to 
date," Bowers said. 

Bowers said he believes the 
university does a thorough job. 

"I'd say that food here on cam-
pus is safer than it is out in San 
Diego, just because [on-campus 
eateries] get more attention from us 
than San Diego County can possi-
bly give all of San Diego," he said.

'Scores: General safety 
hazards taken into account 

conlinued from page 3 
company, according to Sparks. 

Food vendors lose points for 
general safety hazards as well as 
food safety violations. 

"When I go through, it's much 
more detailed, much more 
involved, I think, than a regular 
county [inspection]," envirQnmen-
tal health specialist and UCSD 
inspector Bruce Bowers said. "I try 
to put everything on there, even 
safety concerns like seismically 
securing things, things that might 
not be pertaining right to food ill-
ness, but to general safety." 

Muir Woods Coffee Shop and 
Middle of Muir's score was lowered 
by safety infractions such as a faulty 
electrical outlet, cabinets and shelv-
ing that are not seismically 
restrained, fire extinguishers that 
are in need of inspection and a 
damaged light-switch cov~r. 

According to Muir College 
Center director Vincent Manson, 
facility repairs are handled by 
Housing and Dining Services 
maintenance teams, which are not 
under the direction of the store's 
manager. 

John Muir College sophomore 
Anthony Austin said he was not 
worried because he felt the viola-
tions were minimal. 

"A little bit of mold is not going 
to kill you," Austin said. "A little bit 
of din on the floor, it's not going to 
kill you." 

Bowers said that over the past five 
years that he has been conducting 
kitchen inspections at UCSD, there 
have been no proven and document-
ed cases of food-borne illness. 

"The nice thing about hitting 
them every three months is that we 
usually can curtail a rat problem or 
a roach problem before it gets out 
of control," Bowers said. "Thats 

the advantage we h:.ve, I think, over 
the county." 

Chris Nelson, senior food ser-
vice manager at Canyon Vista and 
Earl's Place, said that his restau-
rant's high score sterns from his 
own standards of cleanliness and 
the vigilance of his staff. 

"I have a senior cook down-
stairs, Daniel Thompson, and he 
really has to get probably 75 per-
cent of the credit for Canyon 
Vista," Nelson said. "He spends 3 
lot of his time looking at cleaning 
issues on the weekends when it's 
slower." 

Health inspections at UCSD are 
handled by the EH&S division of 
the university and not the County 
of San Diego Health Department 
because the campus is a state-
owned facility. 

UCSD's EH&S department 
conducts inspections of all on-cam-
pus food vendors at random times 
every quarter. Although the depart-
ment does not issue letter grades to 
restaurants, there are plans to do so 
in the future . 

"We don't even give them a 
chance to go down to 'B,'" Bowers 
said. "We're there working with the 
managers before the problems 
exacerbate themselves and get out 
of control," Bowers said. "But if 
we're not getting the attention of 
the manager, we go up above their 
head and talk with the powers that 
be." 

Usually, infractions are correct-
ed in a timely manner, according to 
Bowers. 

"It seems like we have good 
cooperation from most of the man-
agers," Bowers said. "That's some-
thing 1 feel is kind of nice here at 
UCSD."

Two talented choreographers' show inspired by 
insightful commentary on various societal issues 

By ANDRE Rfos BOLUNGER 
Staff Writer 

In one of the most exciting shows ro hit UCS D this year, BodyLENScape will feature two 
of San Diego's best and most inno-
vative choreographers, Patricia 
Rincon and Jean Isaacs. T hey have 
toured the United States, Mexico 
and Europe, but both are based in 
San Diego and will perform at 
Mandeville Audi torium Feb. 20. 

Rincon and Isaacs have put 
together a tantalizing dance show 
with live music and video. 
BodyLE Scape will feature the 
Martin Luther King J r, Community 
Choir and will portray a landscape of 
thought-provoking images through 
dance and music. T he name 
BodyLENScape references the 
dancers' bodies, the multimedia 
aspects of the performance and the 
set design all at once. 

The event is actually two per-
formances, one from each choreo-
grapher. Rincon is a professor at 

UCSD in the thea tre and dance 
department, where she has trained 
dancers for the past 25 years . 
Rincon has received numerous 
awards, such as the San Diego 
Area Dance Alliance's "Tommy 
Award of Distinction" and the 
North County Latino 
Association's "Latina of the Year 
for Arts and Culture" award . Her 
part of the performance will 
explore society and the ways in 
which our fast-paced world 
moves. 

Isaacs was inspired by photogra-
pher Art Myers' images of orphans 
with AIDS in sub-Sahara Africa, 
and will feature the photos in her 
performance. Isaacs was artistic 
director for San Diego's "3 's 
Company" for nearly 20 years and 
is now the artistic director for San 
Diego Dance Theater. She was a 
National Endowment for the 
Arts/Local Dance Fellowship 
recipient and a San Diego Area 
Dance Alliance Tommy Award 
recipient for community service. 

Dance 
REVIEW 

Isaacs is also a professor at UCSD 
in dIe theater and dance depart-
ment and ' has received the 
"Distinguished Teaching Award." 

With two such notable choreo-
graphers and live music during the 
performance, this beautiful event 
will open your eyes to the places 
where society and dance intersect. 
This is a one-night-only perfor-
mance and is not scheduled any-
where else in San Diego, so be sure 
not to miss it.

'I Ain't Yo Uncle' entertains, enlightens 
Play showcases fine acting, writing and directing 
By JESSICA VACHAL 

Staff Writer 

The credit for the fowldation of any play must go to the play-wright. In the case of "I Ain't 
Yo' Uncle," Robert Alexander, who 
put a deliciously new spin on Harriet 
Beecher Srowc's "Uncle -Ibm's 
Cabin," deserves the honor. Indeed, 
the characters in this dramatic work, 
the most well-known of Alexander's 
23 plays, take Stowe to trial for per-
petrating tereotypes and "failing ro 
get their story right" in her novel. 
What fo ll ows is a poignant yet 
humorous production that reminds 
the nation how far it has to go in 
ordcr to achieve racial equality. 

Even the most exquisi te of 
scripts, however, requires a strong 
director in order to corne alive. Bill 
Fennelly does not disappoint in his 
casting and direction of "1 Ain't Yo 
Uncle." Quonta Beasley'S delightful-
ly independent Topsy, Bradley 
Fleischer's disgustingly sleazy 
Legree, Teri Kretz's refreshingly 
dramatic Eliza, Abdul-Khaliq 
Murtadha's complicated George and 

Owiso Odera's complex Tom are just 
a few of the notable characters who 
truly pull the production together. 

The choreography efforts ofle-dn 
Isaacs, Grace Shinhae Jun and Lesa 
Green-WIlliams do not go WlJ10-
ticed. It is the dance scenes that help 
to contrast the state of race relations 

" In all their ... razzmatazz, thes~ numbers comment [on] 
race." 

II 

both prior to the Civil War and 
today. In all their hip-hop rhythm 
and tap dance razzmatazz, these 
numbers comment that race rela-
tions, unfortunately, have not 
changed so drastically at all . 

Unlike the acting, dancing and 
choreography, the comparatively 
sparse scenic designs and subtle cos-
tumes created by Kevin Judge and 
Raquel Barreto, respectively, are 
kept very minimal. Though 

Concert 
REVIEW 

Barreto's choice to use masks when 
representing specific characters does 
wonders to emphasize both the 
stereotypes of blacks prevalent 
throughout our nation's history, it 
also accentuates the secondary white 
characters within the show itself. 

"1 Ain't Yo' Uncle" provides a 
truly fascinating evening. The only 
minor drawbacks of the show stem 
from those lackluster costumes and 
scenery and the necessaty evil of 
the ensemble cast. AJ I in all , howev-
er, this is a powerful production of 
a powerful play.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 9 

Local upstarts play the Che Cafe 
The Displaced, the Glossines and others support pirate radio 

By IAN S. PORT 
Contributing Writer 

On Feb. 20 the Che Cafe will host a show-case of the best of local San Diego rock. The Liquorice Quartet, the Pinwheels, 
the Displaced and the G lossines will all per-
form at a benefit show for Free Radio San 
Diego, a local pirate radio station. 

Each band playing at the Che Cafe fea-
n lres female vocals and heavy reputations: 
The Glossines (nominated for Best Local 
Recording at the San Diego Music Awards) 
run down the garage rock alley, the 
Displaced (nominated for both Best New 
Artist and Best Alternative Album) take a 
heavy rock sound to the top of the San Diego 
scene, and the Pinwheels bring a sweet taste 
for melody and style to the bi ll. 

The Liquorice Quartet throw their diverse 
influences together into an organ-driven, gui-
tar solo-laden attack led by the complementary 
voices of Kelley Mitchell and Lauren Spears. 
Their songs walk the line between bright, psy-
chedelic unreality and darkness beneath: One 
moment you're in Candyland (the inspiration 
for the group's incredible Web site, 
http;//WWW.lhdiquonuqllflrttt.com). and the 

Concert 
PREVIEW 

next you're in the midst of a dirty, haunting 
trip. Underneath all of it is a throwback rock 
aesthetic that emerges in Chris Fields affect-
ing, grungy guitar work:. 

Walter Bins supplies the staccato snare-
drumming, and with these elements the 
Liquorice Quartet achieve a unique, three-
dimensional sound. T he group has made a 
few good recordings which are available on 
its Web site, but it is looking to go into the 
studio to record more. 

The show bene fit s Free Radio San 
D iego, a politicall)1 minded pirate station 
struggling to put out a somewhat subversive 
message over the din of corporate radio. 
The station, which broadcasts at 96.9 FM, 
plays everything from Al Green to the Yeah 
Yeah Yeahs on a mind-bogglingly diverse 
playlist. 

All proceeds from ticket sales go to Free 
Radio San Diego. Tickets are $5 and doors 
open at 8 p.m.

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Spectacular' presents undergrad talent 
Outlaws and sleepless nights characterize subject matter of plays 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Sriler 

No matter what your taste may be, there is a little something for everyo ne at 
"Our New Play Spectacular." From 
the comedic to the dramatic, this 
event offers a wide range of origi-
nal plays. 

Produced by UCSD student 
Jonathan Josephson, this collection 
of new plays represents the best of 
the undergraduate theater commu-
nity. Over 40 plays were submitted 
for consideration and in the end nine 
were selected to be performed. 

On Feb. 20 at II p.m. and Feb. 
21 at 7 p.m., "Spectacular A," 'the 
fi rst of a two part series, will be per-
formed. "La Ventana," written by 
Natasha Wilder and directed by 
Grace Kim, is the first play on the 

â€¢ program. This play starts with 
Nina's pet rat, Luna, getting ea ten 
by her pet snake, Tobey, and twists 
and turns from there. The second 
play in the production is "Ya No Te 
Es toy Creyendo," written by 
Heatherly Esh and directed by 10m 
Lord. This will be followed by 
"Shangri-la and What Remained," 
written by Andrew Kircher and 

directed by Doug Wong. On Feb. 
21, there will be additional site-spe-
cific plays performed. 

"Spectacular B" will be present-
ed Feb. 20 at 7 p.m. and Feb. 21 at 
2 p.m. "Birthday Suits," written by 
Kate Barooewitz and directed by 
Eugene Cheung, is about a typical, 
or maybe nOt-50-typical, 21st 
birthday party. "Sunshine Smile," 
written by Brendon Chung and 
directed by Lindsey Lashe, tells 
what happens when you mix four 
outlaws with love and a hangover. 
Finally, "Lie Awake," written by 
Anglea Shaddix and directed by BiIJ 
George, takes a look at the things 
that keep one woman up at night. 
There will also be site-specific 
works presented at the end of the 
program on Feb. 20. 

All of the productions will be 
held in Galbraith Hall ' 157 in 
Revelle College and are free of 
charge. Productions without site-
specific work last about one hour 
and 20 minutes, and productions 
that include site-specific work last 
about two hours. 

While the performances are 
free, it is recommended that you 
make reservations in advance at 
http://onpr.bravthort.comlform.html. 

Theater 
REVIEW 

Reservations made the day of the 
show will not be honored. 

This is the final weekend to par-
ticipate in the first ever new play fes-
tival. These productions include the 
hard work of over 40 people, from 
undergraduate writers, directors and 
actors to the faculty and graduate 
students who have given guidance 
and support along the way. 

If you need even more reason to 
check it out, every night there will 
be a free raffle with a chance to win 
tickets to regional theater events 
around San Diego.

'Eurotrip' travels the same old path 
It's not so bad, but save your money for your own trip to Europe 

By KATHLEEN BAILES 
Contributing Writer 

Yet another raunchy teenage comedy, "Eurotrip" makes it painfully obvious why 
Ame ricans, particularly American 
teenagers, have a bad name every-
where . Incorporating every cliche 
in the book and using blatant 
excuses for nudity and partying, 
the film leaves little to the imagi-
nation. Movie trailers that boast, 
"from the producers of ' Road 
Trip ' and 'Old School,'" simply 
advertise the fact that it has all 
been done before. 

The leading roles of Scott 
Thomas (Scott Mechlowicz) and 
Cooper Harris Oacob Pitts) were 
breakthroughs for both actors. 

Film 
REVIEW 

And, as one might expect, the act-
ing is subpar. However, what they 
lacked in dramatic expertise, they 
made up for in personality. 
Mechlowicz creates an endearing, 
not to mention attractive, leading 
man - or, perhaps more appropri-
ately, boy. In Pitts, viewers will find 
the classic loyal side-kick, not near-
ly as good-looking, bur who bears 
the comedic brunt of the show and 
who might remind audiences of a 
younger David Spade. 

J enny (Michelle 
Trachtenberg), who some may 
remember from "Harriet the Spy" 
and "Inspector Gadget," is the 
typical girl who's one of the guys , 
despite the fact that she is rather 
attractive. Trachtenberg'S charac-
ter manages to grate on one's 
nerves, compounded by the fact 
that her ac ting abilities are 
pitiable.

One of the brightest stars in Britain's two-step/garage movement (which includes 
critic favorites the Streets), Dizzee 
Rascal is unJiJce almost any rapper 
you'll hear these days. Originally 
released last year when he was only 
18, Diuee Rascals high-strung, 
voice-cracking delivery cuts 
through his unconventional beats, 
which occasionally threaten to 
alienate listeners. The result is an 
emotional, abrasive debut that is 
less inviting than most hip-hop 
releases but will leave much more 
of an impression. 

Even at its most accessible 
moments, &y in Da Cornn' brims 
with so many ideas arid so much 
energy that it's almost overwhelm-
ing. In the first single, "I Luv V," 
Dizue and a female MC spar about 
a disreputable female friend who 
may be carrying the rapper's child. 

Gritty, minimalist and brash, the Walkmen may indeed be proto-punk revivalists, but 
the New York noise the band 
unearths on its sophomore release 
Bowr and Amr.u is more akin to 
the Strokes than Lou Reed , 
Television or the New York Doll s. 

Don't file the WalJanen next to 
Jet in the genera-revival class just 
yet. Bowr tmd Arrowr is an ambi-
tious, if scattered, effort, laden with 
the ~me angular rhythms, egalitar-
ian vocal mixing and new-old aes-
thetics that have reestablished New 
York as the rock 'n' roll Mecca of 
the new millennium. 

The Walkmen find their most 
unique voice in an unexpected 
place - the warming organs of 
Walter Martin, who reshapes even 
the harshest, most jagged measure 
into full, whole-note bliss. Martin's

Dizzee's mostly homemade 

beats sound a little like TtmbaJand 
under a budget, stuttering and 
bass-driven with enough creativity 
to overcome its low-fidelity. 

The songs are more aggressive 
on the atonal harmonies of "WOt 
U On" and the rap-along ':Jus a 
Rascal," one of the few songs to 
mimic current hard-edged 
American rappers. These tracks 
can be grating and make the album 
best when listened to in parts. But 
the emotion underneath the 
aggression brings you back for 
more. Beautiful chimes underscore 
songs like the terrific "Brand New 
Day" and the spine-tingling closer, 
"Do It." Dizzee raps, "Sometimes I 
wake up wishing I could sleep for-
ever," and every word stings.

Eurotrip: Paltry acting is 
fatal flaw in foul teen flick 

continued from page 10 
some of Europe's more famous 
and artsy landmarks will be disap-
pointed. In countries where the 
drinking age is nonexistent and 
marijuana is legal, filmmakers 
sadly found the coffee houses of 
Amsterdam and nude beaches 
much more appealing than, say, 
the Louvre in France. 

However, setting aside the 
baudy cliches, the obvious 
European stereotypes and the 
unmistakably uncultured group of 
American teenagers, "Eurotrip" is 
not necessarily a bad way to spend 
an hour and a half of one's life. 

Director Jeff Schaffer has creat-
ed, for the most part, a likable 
group of characters and entertain-
ing scenarios. Unexpected cameos 
from well-known actors in atypical 
roles will surprise and amuse all 

audiences. And one would be hard-
pressed to find s0!Deone leaving 
the theater and not humming the 
catchy tune "Scotty Doesn 't 
Know." 

Taking "Eurotrip" for what its 
worth (a rather unoriginal film 
about a group of recent high school 
graduates looking for a good time), 
one can sit back, relax and laugh 
themselves silly at the sexual and 
alcohol-influenced antics and 
adventures of four American 
teenagers lost in Europe. .

THE UCSD OUARDIAN HIATUS 11 

'Against the Ropes' down 'for the count 
Meg Ryan shines in an atypical role, but the dull drama falls flat 

Iy DEENA AL SHAm 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

There 's a lot to be said for women-empowerment films like "Erin Brockovich," since 
this style of film is inspiring and 
can motivate audiences to believe 
they can do anything they set their 
minds to. 

"Against the Ropes" is not one 
of these films. 

Meg Ryan'S latest film is less 
an inspirational film of success 
than it is a Lifetime original 
movie brought to the big screen. 
"Against the Ropes" is a fiction-
alized account of the life of 
Jackie Kallan, one of the first 
female boxing managers. The 
movie follows Kallan as she dis-
covers Luther Shaw (Omar 
Epps) when she witnesses him 
beat up a junky boxer for drug 
money. Kallan trains him with 
the help of Felix Reynolds 
(Charles Dutton) , and the plot 
goes from there in the most 
unsurprisi ng manner possible. 

The entire premise is con-
trived. How probable is it that 
someone could find a boxing sta r 
after watching him beat up anoth-
er person for drug money' Just 
about every character outside of 
Kallan and Shaw are either saints 
or evil - there is no in-between. 
The plot focuses on the fame 
going to KaHan's head; a develop-
ment that has been seen in every 
"ordinary-person -turns-famous" 
film since the beginning of time. 
It's as if the writers were too lazy 
to actuaHy think of a story line 
that wasn't predictable. 

The film is marketed as a 
drama, but there is no drama. 
There isn't even a moment where 
you wonder what's going to hap-
pen. 

It isn 't all bad, though. Ryan 
does an impeccable job of bring-
ing Kallan to life. Everything 
from the wardrobe to the accent 
is done in a wonderful impres-
sion of the real Kallan . The 
actors also have terrific chem-
istry with one another, which 

Film 
REVIEW 

helps make the characters be 
more than just flat and one-
dimensional. Epps, in particular, 
does a fabulous job at portraying 
Shaw, a boxer who is stunned by 
his sudden fame and his manag-
er's ego trip. 

"Against the Ropes" is a film 
that you'd go see on a rainyafter-
noon when yo u're eager to take a 
break from finals. If you're expect-
ing anything deeper than a made-
for-TV movie, you will be sorely 
disappointed.

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSD dropped by unranked CSUN 
Struggling No. 15 women's water polo falls to 2-7 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

After an inspired performance 
against UC Santa Barbara, where 
cohesive play made a long-awaited 
appearance, the No. 15 UCSD 
women's water polo team knew a 
Feb. 13 home match against 
unranked Cal State Northridge 
could build on that confidence. 

However, the Tritons lost the 
game, 7-6, at Canyonview Pool on 
senior two meter defender Pam 
Barba's sudden-death goal one 
minute and 56 seconds into the 
third overtime. 

After leading 4-1 at the end of 
the first period and 6-4 to begin the 
fourth, the Tritons let the Matadors 
slip through exposed cracks and tie 
the core twice. These cracks need 
patching if UCSD is to seriously 
compete against San Jose State on 
Feb. 20 and in the Davis Shootout 
on Feb. 21 and Feb. 22 to improve 
on a 2-7 record. 

"Even if we would have won in 
overtime, it wouldn't have 
changed the mistakes that we 
made during the game that gOt us 
there," UCSD head coach Larry 
Sanders said. 

Senior Meris Bantilan-Smith's 
two goals were tops for the Tritons 
while junior utility Courtney 
Clevenger, junior driver Jessica 
Wong, sophomore driver Flynn 
LaRochelle and junior utility Tobi 
Lyman t:ach cashed in once. Chari 
C hristopher led the Matadors 
with three goals, bolstered by one 
goal each from Erica Bonetti and 
Kristen Franz. But Barba 's game-
tying and winning goals were the 
nails in the coffin for a struggling 

Stuck in I rut: The young UCSDwomen's water polo squad hasn't been able 
to find its rhythm this season and are currently on a four-game skid. 

UCSD defense that held tight for 
several minutes but let up when it 
counted most. 

After LaRochelle scored the 
first goal qf her career to break a 
4-4 deadlock in the third, and 
Lyman converted off the rebound 
of a Bantilan-Smith shot with one 
second left in the period, the 6-4' 
lead swung the momentum toward 
UCSD. However, Cal State 
Northridge's Christopher laced a 
shot through sophomore goalie 
Kaitlin Foe's outstretched arms to 
make the game unnervingly close 
with over four minutes left. 

The Tritons put a heavy press 
on the Matadors for the next three 
possessions, and it appeared that 
UCSD would slip away with the 
victory. But with 30 seconds left, 
Cal State Northridge grabbed the 
ball from UCSD freshman two-
meter offense Natalie Hockett and 

fired down the pool to a streaking 
Barba, who, untouched, had plen-
ty of time to pump and aim her 
shot, a low bounce under Foes left 
arm to send the game into over-
time. 

"We relaxed too soon, and we 
weren't executing," said UCSD 
senior goalie Stephanie 
Lombardo, who made four saves 
in the first half. "We have defens-
es that are strong, but those 
defenses that we didn't execute 
today need sharp mental focus ... 
This game should have been com-
pletely different." 

The Tritons had definite 
opportunities to put the game 
away in the fourth quarter and in 
overtime, where they went 0-for-3 
on man-up opportunities, but 
couldn't stammer many shots on

wins in some close second-set 
scares. Dao was able to hold off 
Bachofer at No. 2 singles, win-
ning the first set, 6.2, and rallying 
from behind in the second set to 
win 7 -6 in a ti ebreaker, narrowly 
avoiding a third set. Roberts fin-
ished the first set, 6-2, as well , and 
then fi nished the seco'nd set with a 
close 7 -5 victory. 

Triton sophomore Marissa 
Hilker had a relatively trouble-
free match , bea ting Maggie 
Bollinger, 6-0 and 6-4, at No. 4 
singles. McKee, who was named 
the CCAA Player of the Week on 
the day of the match, easily out-
maneuvered her opponent, 6-0 
and 6-0. McKee was given the 
honor for her 2-0 record in both 
singles and doubles against Alliant 
rnternatio nal and Point Lorna 
Nazarene last week; in both of 
which she held her opponen ts off 
6-0 and 6-0.

"What we're doing right now

Basketball: UCSD converts 
25 .. 32 free throws in victory 

continued from page r 6 
36-28. 

The Tritons were ahead 
throughout the game but saw their 
lead close to within four points on 
three occasions, pulling away every 
time. The Warriors had cut the 
lead to one point with 2:26 remain-
ing, but UCSD made all of its final 
10 free throws to secure the game. 
The Tritons finished with a 77-71 
win. 

UCSD had a huge advantage 
from the free-throw line, making 
25 of 32 attempts, whlle Cal State 
Stanislaus only attempted five 
shots from the foul line. 

Juster led all Tritons with 19 
points, with Ginn, junior forward 
Margaret Johnson and sophomore

Front Row: Fantasy sports 
could lure fans to Triton events 

continued from page r 6 
compete in real games, your fantasy 
team gets points based on their per-
formances. For example, if you have 
Kevin Garnett on your fantasy team 
and he scores 24 points and has 13 
rebounds in one night, you add those 
point and rebound totals to your 
team's stats. You become the general 
manager and coach of your team, 
deciding who to start or bench and 
whether or not to accept a trade offer 
while monitoring the progress of 
your players. 

What started out as a pastime 
for only the most sports-obsessed 
has become the hobby of millions 
nationwide. All of a sudden you 
have a rooting interest in a football 
game between the Ravens and the 
Jets that you otherwise wouldn't 
have cared about, and whether or 
not Rasheed Wallace makes his free 
throws in a game that's all but over. 

Even though I think I've taken it 
a bit too far - I find myself rooting 
for Shigeki Maruyama's putt to 
break harder to the left so Phll 
Mickelson can move up to third 
place - this increased interest in 
things I wouldn't otherwise care 
about gives me an idea. 

What if we had our very own 

fantasy league here at UCSD, 
devoted entirely to UCSD sports' 
Attendance at women's basketball 
games isn't usually very good, but 
would more people show up if they 
had Ali Ginn on their fantasy teams 
and were rooting for her to score 
20? Would mens volleyball games 
be more exciting if along with root-
ing for the team, fans cared about 
how many kills Adam Toren was 
able to pick up? Would softball get 
more attention if fantasy owners' 
hopes rose and fell with Amy 
Mettee's batting average? 

The idea may be impractical, 
but for fantasy geeks like myself, it's 
definitely intriguing. It shouldn't 
take fantasy teams to get people out 
to see UCSD compete, but I think 
that if it was enough to draw people 
out in the first place, they'd want to 
come back. 

Unfortunately, I've run out of 
time to ponder this subject. I need 
to see how many greens in regula-
tion Sergio Garcia has hit lately 
before I go to class. I'll start trying 
to control my addiction tomorrow.

put two runs on the board in the 
tOP of the sixth inning, but it 
would not be enough to overtake 
the Tritons, who scored two addi-
tional runs in (he bottom of the 
seventh to secure the victory. 

UCSD senior centerfielder 
Brett Burton, junior shortstop 
Keith Hernandez and junior left-
fielder Craig King each had stolen 
bases in the game. 

With a 9-4 record overall and a 
2 -2 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association record, the Tritons 
return to conference play this week 
with a four-game series against Cal 
State San Bernardino. The teams 
will play single games on Feb. 19 
and Feb. 20 in San Bernardino, 
Calif., and then the series will move 
to San Diego where the Tritons 
and the Coyotes will playa double-
header on Feb. 21 beginning at 
noon.

Driven: No. 5 Craig King and the Tritons are currently 2Â·2 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association and are tied for fourth behind league-leader Sonoma State. 

Cal State San Bernardino comes 
into the series with a 1-3 record in 
the CCAA, but are 5-5 overall. The 

Coyotes are ranked eighth in con-
ference versus the fifth place

goal and, many times, were forced 
to dump the ball after hesitating. 

A combined six possessions dur-
ing those two periods died at two 
meters, where Hockett and senior 
Lesha Bounds were having trouble 
containing passes and getting sholS 
off under pressure. Both have limitÂ· 
ed game experience at the position, 
and Sanders stresses that the offense 
"will get better over time because 
[Hockett and Bounds] are learning 
and developing well." Maintaining 
the intensity that the Tritons opened 
up against Cal State Northridge for 
an entire game will be "the key to 
improving," he said. 

For the first period, it seemed 
lilce the Matadors were going to be 
the pushovers that everyone 
assumed them to be, as the Tritons 
converted on three straight posses-
sions, displaying confidence and 
control in their play, especially in the 
second goal. After drawing an ejec-
tion at two meters, the UCSD 
offense set itself up in a 4-2, echoing 

out confidently "just like in prac-
tice," moving and pumping the ball 
with precision to get a shot off. The 
shot was tipped, but on the throw-in 
BantiJan-Smith fired horne to covert 
the 6-on-5 advantage. 

" This game should have been completely 
different. " 

- Slephlnie Lombardo, senior 
. soar .. UCSD women's water 

polo 

Bantilan-Smith would also end 
the period in the same fashlon, tak-
ing a cross-court pass on a man-up 
opportunity and drilling a shot 
with 7.2 seconds left to give UCSD 
a 4-1 lead, bolstered by the 2 -for-2 
performance on man-up chances in 
the period. 

The confidence, however, wore 
away with UCSD's loss of control 
of the ball and the lead. The first 
sign of struggle came at the begin-
ning of the second quarter, when 
Cal State Northridge fired a shot 
that bounced off a post and trailed 
off to the left side of the pool. All 
six UCSD players scrambled down 
the pool, each thinking someone 
had gotten the ball before turning 
around when they heard 
Lombardo screaming for someone 
to pick it up. A surprised 
Christopher picked up the loose 
ball for the Matadors and passed it 
to a wide open Franz, who had a 
good five seconds, unusual in water 
polo, to get the ball past 
Lombardo, cutting the lead to 4-2. 
And so began a turnaround for Cal 
State Northridge that would last 
right up until Barba's game winner. 

The Tritons will head to San 
Jose State for their next matchup 
on Feb. 20. UCSD will then spend 
Feb. 21 and Feb. 22 at the UC 
Davis Shootout in Davis, Calif.

Women's tennis extends winning streak to four 
No. 19 Tritons improve to 4-0 with 6-3 defeat of Cal St~te Los Angeles 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

T he No. 19 UCSD women's 
tennis team continued its. victory 
streak Feb. 16, improving its over-
all record to 4-0 by defeating 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association foe Cal State Los 
Angeles at the CSULA Tennis 
Complex. 

"[Cal State] LA was a much 

improved tea'm," UCSD head 
coach Liz LaPlante said. "We 
really needed to play well to win. 
We didn't expect them to be quite 
so strong ... They got some new 
freshmen, but we were still able to 
pullout a win." . 

The Tritons were able to 
experiment with their doubles 
lineup against Cal State Los 
Angeles . UCSD senior Julie 
Westerman and junior Jasmin 

Dao quicldy defeated their oppo-
nents, Phoebe Bacofer and 
Ronalyn Miller, in an 8-4 match. 
In addition, at No. 2 doubles, 
sophomore Tara Siddiqui teamed 
up with freshman Kristin 
Bronowiclti to defeat their 
Golden Eagle opponents in a 
convincing 8-1 victory. 

But at No. 3 doubles, freshman 
Katie McKee and sophomore 
Leigh Roberts had a much 

tougher time handling their 
Golden Eagle opponents, losing 
9-8; as a result, the Tritons headed 
into the singles matches with a 2-
1 lead. 

UCSD managed to give up 
only two matches against the 
Golden Eagles at the No.1 and 
No.5 singles positions. Both Dao 
and Roberts managed to pull off

Baseball beats Cal Baptist, 5-3 
Pitching is key to No. 22 Tritons' success over visiting Lancers 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
earned a 5-3 victOry over Cal 
Baptist University on Feb. 17 in a 
non-conference game at Triton 
Baseball Stadium. 

While the Feb. 12 through Feb. 
14 series against Cal State Los 
Angeles was an offensive battle, the 
game again t Cal Baptist was a 
pitcher's duel. 

Junior Triton Justin Allred 
threw six innings, giving up just 
two runs on four hits. His pitching 
effort earned him the victory, 
improving him to 2 - Ion the sea-
son. 

"To be a postseason ball club, 
you need to have depth on your 
pitching staff," UCSD head coach 
Dan O'Brien said. "We have so 
many solid pitchers, and to have a 
fre h arm [Allred) throw six solid 
innings midweek coming off of a 
four-game weekend says a lot. I see 
this pitching staff getting stronger 
as the year goes on, and that's 
exciting." 

Triton junior transfer pitcher 
Shlomo Lipetz came on in relief 
in the eighth inning to close the 
game and ea rn his third save of 
2004. 

For Cal Baptist, starting pitch-
er Oscar Serrato went three 
innings, giving up three runs on 
three hits . Serrato falls to 1- 1 
with the loss. 

Offensively, UCSD put up two 
runs in the second inning and one 
run in the third to jump out to a 
3-0 lead, while the Lancers put up 
goose eggs for the first five 
innings of the game. Cal Baptist

A 68-54 loss to California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
leader Cal State Bakersfield on 
Feb. 13, and a 77-71 win over Cal 
State Stanislaus on Feb. 14 
moved UCSD to 12-9 overall and 
8-8 in the CCM. 

UCSD has won both of its 
matchups with Cal State 
Stanislaus this year and has 
dropped both of its games 
against Cal State Bakersfield. 
This was the fifth weekend in a 
row that the team earned a split 
in its two games. 

Cal State Bakersfield playtd 
without its leading scorer, and 

UCSD matched he Roadrunners 
very well in the opening period. 
UCSD kept the game close in the 
first half, and had several leads, 
but trailed at halftime, 30-26. 

The Tritons took a lead early 
in the second half but saw it van-
ish when the Roadrunners went 
on a 9-0 run. UCSD was never 
able to catch them. Cal State 
Bakersfield increased its lead for 
the rest of the half - its largest 
lead was 19 points - and was able 
to cruise to a 68-54 victory. The 
Roadrunners were able to shoot 
56 percent from the floor while 
the Tritons managed only 30 per-
cent. 

Sophomore guard Katie 
McElree led the Roadrunners 

with 22 points, and Lily Ramirez 
had 17 points and nine rebounds. 
Senior guard Ali Ginn had 10 
points for the Tritons. Freshman 
guard Leora Juster had seven 
points along with nine rebounds 
and three assists. 

In UCSD's game against Cal 
State Stanislaus on Feb. 14, the 
Tritons allowed the first basket 
to go to the Warriors, but coun-. 
tered with a three-pointer and 
maintained the lead for the rest 
of the game. Cal State Stanislaus 
was able to cut the lead to four 
points right before halftime, but 
UCSD scored the last four 
points before the buzzer to lead

Pepperdine 
sinks men's 
volleyball 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The No. 13 UCSD men's vol-
leyball team dropped a midweek 
tilt with No. 5 Pepperdine, 3-0 
(30-26, 30-23 and 30-25). The 
Tritons fall to 5-8 on the season 
and are 2-6 in Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation play. 

Pepperdine came out blazing in 
game one, racking up 19 ki lls with 
two errors on 30 attempts for a 
.567 attacking percentage. UCSD 
lacked the firepower to keep up 
with the Waves' attack. 
Pepperdine grabbed the early 10-6 
lead and was able to glide home to 
the game-one victory. 

The Waves looked poised to 
run away with game two as they 
grabbed a 17- 1 t lead, but three of 
the next four Pepperdine servers 
committed errors, and the Tritons 
rallied to come within two at 22-
20. One of Fred Winters' 14 kills 
helped put Pepperdine back on 
track, however, as the Waves went 
on an 8-3 run to end the game, 30-
23. 

It was UCSD who played the

admits 
addiction 

-From theÂ· 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

M y name is Bryce Warwick, and I am a fantasy sports addict. It wasn't so bad 
when-it was just 15 minutes a week 
to tweak a fantasy football roster, 
but then I started playing fantasy 
basketball, which requires check-
ing up on your team a couple times 
a week too. Next came fantasy 
baseball and a team demanding 
seven months of constant atten-
tion. When I started playing fanta-
sy hockey and found myself con-
cerned with the power play pro-
duction of Ladislav Nagy, I started 
to question whether or not I'd 
become addicted. When I started 
playing fantasy golf, I knew. 

For those of you w~o are unfa-
.miliar with the concept of fantasy 
sports, it's relatively simple. You and 
a group of friends - or a group of 
complete strangers if you sign up for 
a public league - draft real profes-
sional athletes and create a team of 
your own. When those athletes
