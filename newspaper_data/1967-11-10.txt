eral American domestic pOlicies. 
Although the general attitude of 

the people present at the demon-
stration was favorable to the SIL's 
poSitions, strong arguments were 
heard for the war as well. 

"Burn draft cards, not babies" 
was countered by cries of "trea-
son and defend your country." 
One woman student declared 
"When I get up in the morning I 
say to myself that I hate America, 
and hate living in America." 

When another student asked her 
why she did not leave, she said 
she could not get a passport.

SIL Celebration 
Hurts Activism 

Just as last week's forest fire bared the back-country trees oC 
their facade of foliage, so did this Tuesday's celebration of the Bol-
shevik Revolution denude the students of the Independent Left of their 
intellectual bark. Apparently the idea of the gathering was to glory 
in the overthrow of the Russian czar in 1917 and the subsequent take-
over of Leninist Communism in Russia. Unfortunately the sentimental 
memory of Lenin and' his comrades was lost in a gush of anti-Isms 
authored by some of the most inveterate of our student political ac-
tivists . The demonstration succeeded only in ~irlng the already 
hackneyed arguments about Vietnam, Black Power and social inequi-
ties in the United States. What an anachronism to discuss current 
affairs amidst the souvenirs of a 1917 pep rally. 

Ultimately this birthday party will have injured the whole idea that 
student activism at the university broadens the education of its cam-
pus community. Demonstratlon~ can, however, be a very fundamental 
and important means of presenting student opinion. The recent cafe-
teria crisis, for example, was brought to a reasonable conclusion 
after the students rallied in Revelle Plaza. According to the head of 
the ad hoc committee, Dean Murphy, "We felt that enough complaints 
about the new set-up have warranted the action we are proposing." 
Only because student opinion was expressed responsibly and maturely 
was the administration willing to reciprocate. 

Student activism, whether assuming a pOlitical garb or any other, 
should be encouraged in so far as it promotes the exchange of ideas 
and provokes serious thought. If, however, this vast opportunity is 
turned into an event characterized by the tiresome waving of well-
chewed verbal rags and the same old childish ranting of extremist 
cant, then the students' use of the rights of d~monstration or pro-
test becomes nothing but a worthless cipher and a waste of time. 

Editoria l Termed fVague ' 
EdUor, Triton Times: 

Probably the most depressing 
thing about the editorial, "War 
is Hell, II in the October 27 Tri-
ton Times is the author's inabil-
ity to regurgitate clearly the stock 
administration arguments he has 
swalled. Stuck in his craw so 
long, most of these arguments have 
been abandoned even by the John-
son Boys. 

Neverthe less, the writer, hidden 
behind the editorial (or, alter-
natively, the royal) 'we' , finds it 
worthwhile (one must assume) to 
skim what is left to the surface 
of administration apologies, and 
present these , without re-wording 
and without rehashing, not to the 
readers of the La J olla Sentinel, 
but to supposedly inte Uigent UCSD 
undergraduates. 

The message of the ed itorial, 
you see, despite the disclaimer 
in its title, is "Avoidance of Res-
pnsib!l!ty." Stylistically the writer 
reenforces his unexamined theme. 
The passive voice dimlnates: "A 
mistake see ms to have been com-
mitted, and hopefully a way out 
can be realistically found."(sic) 
Weak ve rbs are enfeebled further 
by hedging modifier s. With proper 
pastorial impotence, the editor 
pleads, ' let us' do this or that, 
himself explaining no solutions, 
suggesting no goals . 

Vagueness domina ~e5 his non-
.thought. But worse tl.an imploring 
rhetorically, worse than hiding 
behind a royal 'we' , worse than 
forgetting that ins i jious verbs , 
like the situations they depict, 
need human beings ~ J be ref:JJQn-
sible for committe j or sought 
action, the editor h: s undertaken 
to define historical situations by 
distorting them. C( mpromise is 
necessary, he tells those who ar-
dently oppose the war; he who 
claims never to have made a 
compromise Is "a liar or a her-
mit." Yet we must " differentiate 
between compromise and con-
cession;" only cowards concede . 
Concessions, you understand, 
"were made in Korea ... conces-
sioos wer e made In Hungary in 
1956... and concessions (may be) 
unconditionally made In Vietnam." 
Just as the first two led to dis -
aster, it Is Implied, so will the 

latter. Well, it would be useless 
to argue that compromises are 
made up of concessions, and that 
peace demands the human race 
cease living at the level of a 
six-year-old child who wants 
everything is own way: worthless 
too to re-Iterate the same all 
too logical arguments of the dan-
gers and the immoralities of Am-
erican presence in Viewtnam and 
in more than a dozen other such 
situations around the world. He's 
heard the arguments buthe's never 
listened to them, he's never thought 
them throueh.Deprcssing he should 
be the editor of a college paper. 
When he speaks of ' this country,' 
only block print is missing.

Editor' s Note : 
11 Is generally agreed that when 

an editorial Is written and is left 
unsigned, the ideas expressed in 
that editorial are the feelings of 
the newspaper as a whole, and not 
the opinions of anyone individual. 

With this in mind, it made lit-
tle sense for the writer of this 
letter to launch a personal attack 
against the editorial "War Is Hell" 
particularly If his arguments were 
conclusi ve and could stand on their 
own merit. His aroused feelings 
made him guilty of the very thing 
that the editorial attempted to con-
demn, and I quote, " .... rational 
thinking unclouded by emotional 
rhetoric." 

Q,ote of t"e Week 
"When these mOllKs "t:rmonize, 
they are more amusing than a

completely ridiculous, and espec-

they gesticulate! How they intone 
and carefull y modulate their 
voices! How theythrowthemselves 
about and dramatically change the 
expression on their faces! Such 
noisy over-acting makes nonsence 
out of everything. This art is con-
sidered a trade secret and passed 
down from Brother to Brother.

Editor, Triton Times: 

On reading your review of the 
concert given by the New York 
Chamber Soloists earlier this 
month I was surprised to learn 
that the group committed "unfor-
givable blasphemy" by taking 

VI" 's Remark 
He/" Irresponsible 
Editor, Triton Times : 

I read with interest the article 
.entltled " Higgs Speaks to AS 
Senate" in the October 27 Issues of 
this pape r. I am writing this 
letter because of the statement 
(concerning a proposed $100.00 
raise in fees) " , It would just 
mean reapportioning $3.00 a week 
from dates to education,' Vice-
President Herv Sweetwood com-
mented." 

Mr. Sweetwood, are you unaware 
that more is at stake than "date 
money" or as an already elected 
official do you consider yourself 
non-responsible to the students 
like myse lf that have to scrimp 
and save every dime just to pay the 
$219 fee now in effect, the sixty 
or more dollars for texts--and 
there is food, rent, etc. 

I said more is at stake: I am 
a transfer student and for the past 
two years I have enjoyed con-
tributing freely of my time to 
campus organizations--Oceano-
graphic Society President, Crea-
tive Writing club, campus maga-
zine. The chance to Involve myself 
similarly on this campus would be 
gone. 

There is more at stake, Mr. 
Sweetwood. I am a veteran and 
therefore recognize the limitations 
of the G.1. Bill for providing edu-
cation. There are going to be 
quite a few people who decide to 
continue their education after dis-
charge. It will be a shame U 
their chances are injured bya raise 
in fees brought about by Regents 
like Higgs being guided In their 
decision by Irresponsible state-
ments like yours. 

Really, Mr. Sweetwood, is date I 
money all that Is at stake? 

David L. Bull 

" only the instrumental and tenor 
portions," from "the masterful, 
total Cantata 189." You seem to 
disagree with the manuscript, the 
editors of the Bachgesellschaft, 
and the Neue Bach Ausgabe, not 
to mention every recording of 
Cantata #189, which is a cantata 
of three arias for solo tenor, re-
corder, oboe, violin, and continuo, 
with recitatives separating the 
arlas. Granted, the performers 
used a flute instead of a recorder; 
otherwise the performance was 
as good a presentation of the 
music as you or I will ever hear. 
Your Ignorance is unforgivable. 

The fatuousness of the rest of 
the review is probably attributable 
which led you to make the state-
ments about the Bach Cantata. I 
wUl not comment on the Mozart ' 
or Beethoven; I am happy, how-
ever, that you so enjoyed the 
jangle of the harpsichord in the 
Haydn that you failed to perceive 
exactly how badly out of tune 
the harpsichord was. 

My curiosity has been aroused 
concerning how a group of per-
formers might in a piece of Ba-
rOQue musiC, other than to turn 
pages, check Instruments, and pre-
pare to begin the next movement. 
(As I recall, the pauses In the 
Vivaldi were lengthened by the 
noise in the audience.) Perhaps 
you would have preferred that the 
performers change clothes, or 
tickle each other. At any rate, 
[ am sure the performers would 
appreciate your suggestions. 

In closing, [ congratulate you 
for writing perhaps the most Ig-
norant, fatuous, wrong-headed re-
view possible of a concert whose 
contents, as 'nice, Udy,acceptable' 
as they were (at least the Mo-
zart was), were totally beyond your 
Intellectual and musical capabili-
ties. [eager ly antiCipate your re-
view of the Berlin Philharmonic 
Octet. 

Yours for better music.

Students Initiate UCSO 
I(SOT Radio Station 

Have you ever missed an im-
portant lecture" campus movie? 
or your favorite club meeting? as 
a result of the lack of communi-
cations on campus??? Two hope-
less ly lost , but enterprising, 
freshman discovered themselves 
in this perplexing position about 
this time last year. They decided 
there was no need for this s ituation 
and took it upon themselves to at -
tack the red tape and formalitles 
of the University system. 

In November of 1966, Don Bright 
approached Dean Topolovac, As-
sistant Dean of Student Affair s, 
with the idea of forming a campus 
radio statton. Dean Topolovac liked 
the idea and told him to find out 
more about it. Don, with the he lp 
of Jon Collins talked to several 
facult y members and received 
strong support. They began seri-
ous research on all facets con-

cerning the beginning of a radio 
station. This resulted In a budget--
description which was presented to 
the Dean of Student Affairs, Dean 
Murphy, and other administrator s 
at UCSD. It appeared that Radio 
KSDT (San Diego Tritons) would 
soon be a reality. Radio KSDT 
was guaranteed a 10,000 dollar 
budget which would come from in-
cidental fees. A studio was in-
cluded in the plans for the new 
Matthews Commons Facility to be 
located behind Behr ing Hall. Don 
Bright spe nt the summer at Matt-
hews, planning to construct and 
wire the studio in hopes of having 
the station on the air by October 
I, 1967. But, the Commons Faci-
lity has yet to be built. Don pre-
sently learned that the Commons 
Facility will not be completed un-
til March or AprIl. 

Muir Sets Pace with 
Halloween Carnival 

On the Sunday before Halloween 
Muir College took the lead In 
providing UCSD students with 
much-needed activities by presen-
ting a carnival and dance. 

Booths were set up in the patio 
of the Muir Cafeteria with the dance 
being held in the cafeteria itseU. 
The Turtle race provided students 
with the opportunity to put their 
money on such favorites as Trip-
ping Topolovac and Stompalong 
Stewart. At the Fortune Telling 
booth one could have his Pllim 
read by a gypsy. 

The highlight of the event was 
the Slave Trade. Volunteer slaves 
offered their services for 24 hours 
to the highest bidder, the pro-
ceeds going to finance the car-
nival. The only limitations placed 
upon their prospective masters 
we re that they not command the 
girls to do anything "illegal, im-
moral, or fattening." The price::; 
were pushed higher and higher 

in the hot competition that followed, 
with some s laves being sold for 
as much as $3.75! The students 
especially enjoyed the commen~s 
of the auctioneer, whose Identity 
was hidden by a black mask. 

Music at the dance was pro-
vided by the ' Fortes', a San Diego 
group. The combo consisted of as 
many as ten members - the num-
ber seemed to fluctuate through-
out the evening. Their music, pre-
dominantly rhythm and blues, was 
en hanced by a' large brass sec-
tion. A II in all the for mat oC the 
that of most rock groups and 
the students seemed to enjoy the Ir 
performance. 

The Muir Carnival was con-
ceived of by the girls of Serra 
Hall and sponsored by all the 
women's dorms of Muir College. 
Completed in one week, the plan-
ning and or ganization was handled 
by a committee headed by Susan 
Ph!1lips.

Trident Ready To Shoot 
Student Photos Monday 

Pictures for the "Trident" ye-
arbook will be taken starting Mon-
day, the staff announced this week. 

According to Pris Chaffe, Un-
dergraduates, Ads and Sales E-
ditor, dorm pictures will be taken 
of the residents in the old Revelle 
dorms two suites at a time. Blake 
and Argo residents will be photo-
graphed four suites at a time and 
Matthews reSidents, a floor at a 
time. 

Commuter fre shmen will pose 
with the suites that they were as-
signed to during Orientation Week. 
All other Revelle commuters will 
pose In the Formal Lounge from 
9 to JO a.m. and 5 to 6 p.m. on 
Monday, 14 Nov., and Muir com-
muters, in the same place from 
12':30 to 1:30 p.m. and 5 to 6 
p.m. on Wednesday, 16 Nov. 

"All the pictures are supposed 
to be informal," Chaffe said, " and 
we're leaving the exact choreogra-
phy up to the suites themse Ives - -
within photographable reason, that 
Is. " 

The " Tr ident" has only been 
published once since UCSD en-
rolled its fir st undergraduates in 
1964. The 1965 ed ition was only 
UI pa ges in lengt h. 

" The 1968 edition," Linda My-
er s, Business Manager, explained, 
"is planned at 184 pages, 9 by 
12 inches In size, with advertiSing. 
Only 500 copies will be printed, 
but If sales exceed that number, 
more can be orde red in January. 

The annua ls are currently being 
sold for $5 .00 each, but wi ll go 
up to $6.50 after Thanksgiving Day. 

Advertising is being sold in the 
local community as we ll, Chaffe 
said. Whole pages run $100 each.

Murphy RespondsToSIL 
(Continued from page I. ) 

University policy, one which I be-
lieve in and support without reser-
vation. 

In this perspective , your pro-
posal, if it we re to be accepted, 
would represent a distreSSing step 
backward. Aga in we , or someone, 
would select those recruiters , 
those speaker s, those issues , those 
points of view wh ich could be pre-
sented on campus. Were we to 
Collow you r lead, I doubt that it 
wou td take long for this two-
edged sword to cut the othe r way. 
If someone, anyone, is to decide 
which ideas are safe for students, 
rather than to ins ist that students 
are safe for ideas, then the FSM 
accomplished nothing - it may 
have shifte~ the shoe temporarily, 
from the rIght foot to the left, but 
it was a pointless exercise in fu-
tility, in pain and in individual 
commitment. As one who lived 
through all of it, I cannot agree 
that that should be its final out-
come. 

By permitting all recruiters (i-
deas, points of view, speakers) to 

appear on campus, we can defend, 
at one and the same time, the de-
monstration which occurred on the 
Revelle Plaza la st Tuesday and the 
presence of Dow Chemical repre-
sentatives on November 27. By 
selecting a m.1ng recruiters (ideas, 
points of view, speake rs) those that

render the University to persons 
and groups whose moral judg-

ot only is such a prospect per -

think of nothing that can perve rt, 
more effectively, the pur suit of 
truth or t he exercise of freedom. 

As you know, recruite rs at UCSD 
(Ideas, po int s of view, speakers)do 
not enjoy a captive audience; re-
cruiters will be talking with stu-
dents only to the extent that stu-
dents wish to ta lk with them. It is 
also impor tant that recruiters un-
like ideas , points of view or sp~ak­
ers, are not free to use ~ampus 
open discussion and advocacy 
areas. Such use would be incom-
patible, in my judgment and in the 
judgment of the n;versity com-

munity, with the special function s 
which those areas are dedicated to 
serve. In short, I am suggest in~ 
that the initiative with r espect l-
Dow Chemica l or the military ser-
vices res ts entirely with UCS[) 
s tudents - those who sl'.are your

and ask questions or they will sta~ 
away; those who do not agree with 
your position and who ar e interest-

will have the opportunity to do so. 
A univers it y worthy of the name

Council Forms J-BoarcJ 
This past Wednesday in its 

filth meeting, the Interh~1l coun-
cil discussed several matters of 
Importance to res idence hall stu-
dents. The counCil, provided for 
in the Revelle College Residence 
Halls Constitution, was formed to 
represent the resident students in 
matters that concern them and to 
be their chief governing body. 

The most pressing matter was 
the creation of a Judicial board. 
This was provid~d for in the con-
stitution, as it was genera lly felt 
that the students should be the ones 
to enforce the rules that they mllst 
abide by. C layton Anderson, head 
of the sub-committee that was 
formed to deal with the problem , 
drafted a plan, which, with a few 
minor revisions , will be voted 
upon at the next meeting. 

Generally, the plan called for the 
creation of a centralJudicia l board 
of two committees which would di-
vide the work load equally. The 
Council felt that this would limit 
the inequities and impracticalities 
of having separate judicial boards 
for each hall, as was the case last 
year. 

The other ma tter of primary 
Importance was visitation hours . 
Student dis- satisfaction with pre-
sent rules has led th council to 

I consider wh I changes, !f any, they should recommend to th ad min is-
I tration. The council members m t with Dean Hull severa' weeks ago 

and heard his vi ws on the s UbJ ct. 
Nothing definite has been decid d 
yet, but topiCS und I discussion 
have Included tengthening hours 

in the women's suile lounges (on 
the weekend ) and in- room visi-
tation. 

At the last meeting it was de-
cided that before any conclusions 
could be made it was necessary to 
for mulate some general philosophy 
concerning the purpose and natu re 
of the residence ha lls. Th mat ter 
was tabled until the next m ting, 
which will be devoted almost en-
tirely to thi problem. 

Residence Hall Activ ity Fees 
were also disclIssed. The tudents 
paid a thr e dollar fee with their 
first housing installment this yea r, 
but if this pract ice is to be con-
tinued in the futu re, it is n cessary 
to obtain the approval of the resi-
dent students by a two-third vote. 
The council dec .ded to ask for a 
thre dolla r uaterly fee to be 
charged, sta rtin~ next Quarter . 
Of this, 2.50 would go back to the 
indhidu:ti tiurms 10 be Ul>e(l a ' Its

.50 wou ld go to the Inter!! 11 

Council to cover costs or activities 
th y might pi n. The fate of the 
activity fee, thon, is now in the 
hand of th res ident tudents;

UCSD ical 
Specialists Are 
Now The Vogue 

Although medical schools are 
turning out an increasingly greater 
number of doctors, there is still 
a great need for more trained 
physicians in the United States. 
New medical schools, like the one 
at UCSD, are being built to fill 
this need. Dr. Simon, Assistant 
Dean for Student Affairs of the 
UCSD Medical School, attributed 
this shortage to severa I different 
factors, including: maldistri-
bution, ineffective utilization of 
manpower, inefficiency of health 
care delivery systems, and the 
population explosion. 

medical students will be trained 
to work as part of a team. How-
ever, although many of the tech-
nical duties of doctors wUJ be 
taken ove r by nurses and other 
trained help, the actual doctor-
patient re lationship cannot be re -
placed. Diagnosis and counseling 
will still require the trained skill 
of a physician. 

Preventive medicine will also 
free more physic ians to fill the 
every-growing need for medical 
care. Preventive medicine has two 
facets : I) It tries to prevent al-
ready prevalent diseases from re-
occurlng; 2) It tries to stop a small 
problem before it magniCies into 
a large problem. 

The 600-bed County- University Hospital above is 
currently operated by the School of Medicine and 
will be supplemented by a 350-bed University Hos-

pita I and an 800-bed Veteran's Administration Hos -
pital on the La Jolla campus. 

In a Triton Times interview, 
Dr. Simon spoke of the tendency 
of doctor s to settle in cities and 
suburbs and the scarcity of phy-
SlClans In rural and poverty 
areas. H e further states that 
many of the duties that a phy-
sician performs could be carried 
out by le ss expensively-trained 
people. Nurses, optometrists, 
pharmaCist s , and Navy Corpsman 
could all help with the routine 
procedures many doctor s now have 
to perform. A team system with 
a doctor as team leader would 
be much more efficient. The UCSD 

General practitiomers, as they 
were known until several years 
ago, are outdated and medicine 
is relying more and more upon 
specialists. Medicine is full of 
eXCiting new fields with new op-
portunities being made available 
continually. SpeCialists are needed 
in Medical Bio-Engineerlng, Mar-
ine and Space Bio-Medicine, Hu-
man Genetics , Transplantation,and 
many other challenging field s. Ad-
ministrator s are needed to fill 
positivns as deans and to work 
with city planners to solve social 
health problems. Scholarship Program Planned 

Since the process of medical 
training is such a long procedure, 
it is also an expensive one. There-
fore, finance is an important as-
pect of a medical school. 

In the thirties, during the de-
pression, if a pre-med student was 
not accepted at a medical school 
he would go into law or business 
or some other profitable line of 
work . Today, pre-med students 
who are not accepted usually turn 
to psychology, sociology or one of 
the biological sciences. There Is 
a definite trend towards a rela-
tionship bet ween science and a con-
cern for the welfare of man. 

Because of this concern for hu-
manity it is important that those 
students who want to study medi-
cine and cannot aftort to should 
have the financial aid needed a-
vailable to them. U.C .S.D. medi-
cal school hopes to set up an exten-
s ive scholarship plan for these 
students. It will be financed by 
grants and private gifts. However, 

the money for the scholarships 
program has been coming in very 
slowly. 

One of the main sources of 
scholarship fund s now being col-
lected is derived from voluntary 
faculty contribution. This is a 
unique plan in which the U.C.S.D. ' 
medical faculty pe riodically do-
nates a part of their salary to be 
used for scholarships. This is a 
meaningful example of the spirit 
and dedication that these people 
are working so hard to make a 
part of the new medical school. 

The new U.C.S.D. medical 
school, which will open next fall, 
is already attracting the attention 
of prospective medical students all 
over the country. Over 2000 let-
ters requesting applications have 
been received. Many of these have 
been completed and returned. Stu-
dents applying must have a strong 
science background and show a 
genuine interest in the welfare of 
humanity. 

School 
Chance 

Offers Ea rly 
to Special ize 

No matter what fielj of medi-
cine a physician goes i lto he must 
be well trained--with t lisphiloso-
phy In mind, the faculty 'lfthe UCSD 
medical school are b\ ilding their 
curiculum for the [.11 of 1968. 

About one half of tie student's 
time will be spent studying the 
basics of science and finding out 
what it' s all about. 

Medicine is no longer Just a 
profession, it is a science. Pa-
Ilents present problems to be solv-
ed using scientific methods. How-
ever, the student must also be 
taught to be a ware of the tact 
that he is dealing with people. He 
must be able to communicate with 
his patients. 

The other halt of the student's 

time will be given to him to use 
in developing special interests. 

There is a purpose for giving 
this time to the students to use as 
they please. It takes at least four 
years of co lJege, four year s of 
medical school, and one year ot 
inte rnship beCore a sturtent has 
completed the minimum requirec 
preparation. Usually a lew years 
ot residency training follow this, 
so it Is an ext remely longtime be-
fore a student can actually set up 
a practice. By changing the Medi-
cal program, U.C.S.D . hopestocut 
off at least two years of prepara-
tion by orienting a student towards 
a certain field and helping him 
with hIs lutu re plans. 

By mid-February the initial 
class will be filled. Dr. Simon, 
Assistant Dean for Student Affairs 
of the U.C.S.D. medical school, 

said they are confident that they 
will flll the class with, "superb 
individuals from all over the coun-
try. " 

The UCSD medical student will 
be "orientated towards the whole 
needs of society," says Dr. Si-
mon, but, "His fir st obligation 
will be to take care ofthe people." 

Thi s diagram shows the many different professions 
which are available to the student of medicine. Al-
though this Ust Is not exhaustive It otters an idea of 

the breadth of opportunity for the senior medical 
student. 

Poititier Commended in 

UTo Sir With Love" 
Sidney Poltier, recognized as 

a fine actor for well over a de-
cade, has in the past few years 
given powerful and moving per-
formances In a great variety of 
roles. One of his finest films in 
recent months is "To SIr, With 
Love", one which expresses with 
extreme realism and sensitivity 
the spirit of the mod generation. 

Pol tier prot rays an engineer 
who, unable to find a job, accepts 
a position as teacher in the 
tough East end of London. His 
students care nothing of book lear-
ning or diSCipline and are just 
marking time until they are free 
from school to enter the adult 
wor Id. Poltler departs from tra-
ditional curriculum, forgets books, 
and teaches the kids to develop 
maturity and the facts they will 

need to survive in the cold out-
side world. 

Poltler, who has the talent to 
continually and successfully por-
tray men who possess a special 
skill and the under standing needed 
to relieve any intractable situa-
tion , once again succeeds remark-
ably well. He wins not c.nly his 
class's respect, but Its affection 
as well. 

The young players enact their 
roles in a warm, humorous, and 
often moving manner. The most 
notable among them are Christian 
Roberts pla'ying a young tough 
whose alienation changes to res-
pect, and a bright, smashlngly 
cute look-alike for Julie Christie 
named Judy Geeson. The film is 
a mixture of fine drama and pure 
joy, and the great title song should 
be a contender for an Academy 
Award.

"Long Day's Journey Into Night" 
has been called "the single most 
powerful play in all American 
drama." 

John Ellsworth portrays the fa-
ther, a famed but fading theatrical 
matinee idol. His hopelessly ad-
dicted wife Is played by Gertrude 
Waggaman. The Eugene O'Neill 
role will be portrayed by John 
Schak, suffering from tuberculosis 
and facing ho spitalization. His 
older brother will be played by 
Jonathan Dunn-Rankin, filled with 
self-contempt for his lack of ac-
complishment. Tauri Inness-
Brown will play the family house-
maid. 

Craig Noel, producing director 
for the Old Globe Theatre, will 
stage the first Eugene O'Neill 
play ever produced by the local 
theatre organization. Peggy Kell-
ner Is responsible for scenery and 
costumes.

Two of the most interesting and 
exciting cultural events to come to 
San Diego In a long time occu red 
last week: The Royal Welsh and 
Scot Guards, who performed on 
Thursday evening in the Sports A-
rena, and the Flamenco guitarist 
Carlos Montoya, who performed on 
Friday at the Civic Theater. 

The least that one can say about 
the Royal Welsh and Scots Guards 
is that their performance i <; excit-
ing and colorful. From thE minute 
they entered the Arena wearing 
their brilliant red and gold uni-
form s th~ held the audience cap-
tivated by their thrilling musIc 
and precision marching. TheScots' 
Pipers and Dancers, however, 
proved to be the most popular 
part of the show. The audience, 
which contained every Scot In town 
(including those who own kilts), 
voiced their approval enthusiasti-
cally whenever the Scots Guards 
a,peared. 

In aU, the performance, which 
included many well known marches 
and airs plus an excellent Inter-
pretation of Tchalkowsky's 1812 
Overture with cannons, was su-
perb with all Its polish and pagean-
try. The on ly dlsconcernlng fea-

ture was that the program in-
cluded some pieces which could 
not exactly be considered approp-
riate such as "The Old Grey 
Mare." The rest of the program, 
however, made up for these mi-
nor fault s. 

Carlos Montoya managed to keep 
a near-capacity audience entranc-
ed single-handedly. His perfor-
mance was impeccable and his in-
te rpretations of Flamenco music 
were faSCinating as well as excit-
ing. His ability to improvise with-
in the boundaries of a certain 
rhythmic scheme were well de-
monstrated in his performance. 

He also proved his worth as a 
performer. As soon as he entered 
upon the stage h captured the 
audience and he was able to hold 
as well as further deve lop this 
rapport. The Civic Theater, how-
ever, failed to do justic to Mon-
toya's artistry. The house is far 
too Large to allow th intimacy 
which a performance oC thll> type-
requires, and the sound system 
did not manage to carry the rich 
tones and the intricate passages 
of Montoya's playing to the upper 
regions of the theater.

Peck ham was 1st for UCSD, fini-

of 100 places. Segal, who had 
generally been near the top, was 
bothered with an arch sprain and 
dropped to 5th on the UC squad. 
Coach Wilson was especially 
pleased with the Triton's 2nd fini-
sher Gillette, who had previously 
been 4th. Farrar was 3rd for the

4th. After a s low start, Kumley

establlsh skiing in our country, 
especially Kashmir, and to create 
an interest in the sport in India. 

As you know, the Himalayas have 
a great skiing potential. We fe el

it has had in Europe, Japan, South 
America, Australia, New Zealand 
and the United States, where skiers 
are numbered in the millions. 

So far , no one has organized the

~, DAVE STEARNS 

What with the recent furor over inter-collegiate football, some 
sports have been s idelined. Student support is imperative for all 
facets of the UCSD athletic program , and particularly for the newer 
endeavors , i.e. swimming, water polo, soccer and baseball in the 
spring. 

It is, of course, inconvenient to support some events becallse 
many are held at the opponent schools. But our facillties are ever-
expanding, as evidenced by the newly completed natatorium, the 
renovated track field, and the slowly-ris ing, but nevertheless pro-
gressing gymnasium. Regretfully, this gym will not be fini shed in 
time for basketball, but should be completed by April!. 

Speaking of basketball, Coach Neale Stoner has his charges in 
active preparation for their fir st game November 2!. He feels that 
the team is deve loping well and is looking with anticipation toward 
their fir st fllll varsity season. 

Senior Dave Shiner, who played on UCSD's !irst basketball team 
a few years ago, has returned from sick bay. Stoner welcomed him 
as a necessary asset to the squad. Shiner injured a knee 2 years 
ago, had an operation on it, and proceeded to injure it again. The 
doctor now gives him a clean bill of health, and so the big boy joined 
his team on Tuesday. 

Shiner, a 6'1" guard [rom Kearny High School in San Diego will 
offer the UCSD basketball team greater depth. Stoner feels that if 
the squad has one glaring weakness, the lack of team depth is it. 
"But," conjectured stoner, "everybody is healthy now, and if they 
stay that way, we should hold our own." 

All home games are played in the Mirimar Air station Gym, about 
15 minutes inland from the UCSD campus. Private cars are admitted 
through the main gate on U.S. 395 for the games, and plans are under-
way for an AS bus to transport eager students to and from the games. 

The vast amount of student support for the intramural sports 
program, in both participants and spectators, is viewed gratefully 
by this writer, for It shows that students on campus are interested 
in at least one activity sponsored by the administration. We can 
claim as a group that we are not apathetic about everything, despite 
what some people say. 

Many athletic opportunities are slowly being patronized by stu-
dents and facuity. The sports department offers not only the major 
inter-collegiate sports (except football) but also provides the student 
without much tlme or ambition to enjoy the many benefits of in<li-
vidual and team sports in competition. A fine array of weight equip-
ment is kept on the Matthews Campus for everyone's use, and the 
department checks out most anything else: archery equipment, bi-
cycles, sweat suits, teMis gear, lockers and all types of playing 
balls. 

Keep in mind that the more student support there is, the more 
the athletic program becomes an Integral part of the campus curricu-
lum. Improvement comes slowly, but it will be far quicker with an 
active student population showing that they want such a program. 

Coach Mike Gerry instructs his charges in the fine art of water polo. 
CombIning fast action and endurance, UCSD's Tritons are playing for 
the first time.
