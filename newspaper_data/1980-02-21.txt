SIaIf WrIIIr 

Former ABC anchonnan 
and foreign corre.pondent 
Howard K. Smith was 
straightforward about hi. 
support for the reinstitution of 
the draft in a talk with The 
Doily Guardian following a 
recent lecture at the University 
of Sao Diego. 

"Every youth should give 
.acne .,..,. of hi. life to doing 
the thinp our country need.. 
M ,.....aion did it; if they dl.'t. you wouldn't have a 
natioo WI which to protest the 
draft, " Smith 1Iid. 

Smith, who resiped from 
C85iDl961 because network 
offici. refused to let him air a 
comm.ntary unedited, i. 
natioaally recopized .. one 
of the foremoat commentator. 
of political aner econoIllic 
i .. uet. 

Smith said that citizens 
ahouJi1 have the option to 
chooae the type of work in the 
National Service best suited to 
their interest, whether it be the 
military or deaning up city 
alum •• 

Smith. however, does not 
beI~e America is ""earilll up 
for war." The Ruuiant .-e 
"scared of w .... he Nid, and

Acknowledl{i~8 that

Smith .aid it is up to the 
citizen. to change their 
Iife.tyles to make the country

irn~rts. 
Smith also gave the US 

government equal time,

On corporate America, 
Smith said we must get rid of

Council Asks Dunnett for 
More Search Infonnation 

BY JEFF BE:RFSFORD-HOWE 
New. EditOr 

Cheryl Dunnett, undergraduate 
repreaentative to the chancellor' • aearch 
committee, wu put on notice that she would 
have to COl1lult more with other .tudents during 
the search proceu or be replaced. 

AS Commi .. ioner Brad Barham introduced 
a resolution at lut night'. AS Council meeting 
that require. her to make public her criteria for 
judging chancellor candidates and ask. her to 
consult more frequently with her fellows on the 
student search committee. 

Dunnett resp()ndeCf by meeting with her 
committee for an hour-and-a-half, finally telling 
the council that they had worked things out. 

"I think there was a breakdown in 
communication there," .he said. "They will be 
participating in the search procell." 

A key point of di.agreement with her 
committee and the council- revealing the final • 
list of candidates to other students - was 
resolved, Dunnett said. 

"I'm going to tell them when there are stiD a 
number of finalists," Dunnett said. "They win 
be able to help me look at the candidate •. But 
there has to be more than that. Campus groups 
and organizations have to write to the ~arch 
committee and lei I them what their concerns are 
and let them know what they think i. important 
in a chancellor." 

It i. po •• ible that Dunnett may not serve 0 the 
committee much longer, whether the AS 
Council approves of her or not.

Vietnamere soldiers are conducting search-and·

three, had to be carried to Am Leang. 

One 01 the three able to walk wu Mum, a 20·year·

lurh tropical vegetation, and the mounds of engine· 
parts are surrounded by mounds of 11\81' gravel. 

In late February of lut year, Pol Pot cadreaat Am 
Leang began executing commune worken in an 
apparent attempt to prevent desertions. Several 
peasanb stated that eratire work brigadel, numbering 
more than 1,000 people, were marched into the 
jungle and executed during the Iut week of February. 
Vietnamese aoldien at the pagoda pointed out 
numerour mass graves within a mile of the temple. 
Local villagers then guided the soldiers and me 
through the forest, river - which we waded tIvough 
- to a large mali grave aite. An earthen mound 40 
yardl wide was said to contain the bodies of 
thouaanda of people executed by the Pol Pot cadre. 

At proof, the IlI'OURCl was overturned in several

During February and March, 1979, foUowm, the

-It's Official .- We're 
Not Going to Moscow 

WASHINGTON - The Carter administration said 
yesterday the United States will officially boycott the Moscow 
Olympics this summer and the US Olympic Committee officials 
and athletes are expected to follow suit. 

White HOUle counsel Lloyd Cutler made it clear that the 
committee, which oversees US participation in the games, is 
being relied on to abide by President Carter's decilion. 

In Bonn, We.t Germany, chief State Deparbnentspokesman 
Hodding Carter announced the final decision as the deadline 
,arrived for the Soviet Union to pull its troops out of Afghanistan. 

"The United States set a deadline for its decision on whether to 
participate, a decision to be contingent on the withdrawal of 
Soviet tr~pa," said Carter, accompanying Secretary of State 
Cyrua R. Vance on a tour of European capitals. 

"Today is the day on which that decision Will going to be 
baaed. It is clear there is no sign of a Soviet withdrawal. The 
president has made clear that our decision is irrevocable. We will 
not participate in the Olympic. in Moscow," the spokelman 
aaid. 
. In Washington, State Deparbnent spokellllan Thomu 
Reston said the boycott decision il "firm and unalterable." 

He said, "It it a position' which is shared by more than 50 
governments throughout the world and which will be reflected, 
we are convinced, by the nonparticipation ~y at least that 
number of national Olympic teams in Moscow. to 

The White Hou.e said in a written statement that, with the 
month passed and the Soyiet forces remaining in Afghanistan, 
"the president has therefore advised the 'United States Olympic 
Committee that his decition remains unchan.,Red, and that we 
should nol send a team to Moscow." 

"The president thanked the committee for its earnest and 
patriotic efforts to Present the case for transferring, postponing 
or cancelling the gaines, and uked it to take prompt action to 
formalize ib acceptance of his decision," the statement said. 

The statement said Carter'l position on the Olympics "has 
been OVerwhelmm,lye::ed by the United State. Contreu 
and the American .'" -

Outraged by the viet thruat into Afghaniltan, Carter served 
notice in a Jan. 20 nationally broadcast addrell that he was 
giving the Soviets 30 days to withdraw or ri.k a US boycott of 
the Olympic Gamel in Moscow this summer.

weekend and said Iranian 
authorities ' want the 
commission members to talk 
to all of the approximately 50 
American hostages in Tehran. 

One of the five com million 
members laid, meanwhile, 
there was a "gentlemen's 
agreement" that the hostages 
would be freed as a result of 
their miuion. The timing of the 
release remained unclear, 
however, 

Waldheim, speaking to 
reporte,. in New York, said he 
poatponed the departure of the 
five lawyers and diplomats 
since the Iranian. had asked

Patricia Dea.y.Spin~tta, a 
SDSU paycholopt and co· 
ordinator of the event. 

Living with cancer, .he 
says, may mean having to 
deal with falling hair or an 
amputated limb. While this i. 
difficult for a child to deal with, 
the situation is probably 
hardest for teenagers, she

AS Makes "Power Play" on Hut CollectIve 
BY JENNIFER W AMEN 

!laffw .... 
The AS Cound moved to 

cauoIidate ita authority over 
the Coffee Hut Collective wt 
night, voting to require 
quarterly review of the 
Collective's actions and 
annual budget approval, an 

action Collective member 
Scott Keuler called "a bunk 
political power play." 

AS President Carlol 
Montalvo supported the 
council's decision, however, 
insilting that, "lome 
conltraintl and an ongoing 
communication procell

between the AS and the 
Collective are essential" to 
ensure the prosperity of the 
Collective. 

MOlt council members 
agreed that "budget approval" 
of the Collective by the AS 
was justified because the 
council granted the 3,000 
needed for establilhment of 
the food service. 

But, Keasler said, "we want 
the budget to be decided by the 
people who work co-
.ratively in the Collective. 
Having the AS as a body 
above us defeats the purpose 
of a collective." 

The additional AS requeat 
that budgets for lubsequent 

years be submitted to the 
council no later than April met 
with further oppolition from 
KeISler. 

"We really can't accurately 
project a budget like the 
Student Center Board can. It's 
Imposlible to know how many 
crates of orangel we're going 

eed " to n . t 
Council members countered 

that a "projected" budget need 
only present an idea of what 
wiD be lpent during the year. 

Despite Montalvo'l claim 
that the AS merely "wants to 
make lUre their money il 
maximized and the Collective 
doesn't fall by the waYlide like 
otherl have don Kessler 

concluded, "Are you trying to 
exert your power around here 
or do you want to let ltudents 
do something constructive?" 

In other AS business last 
night..... . 

- The council voted 
unanimously to send a letter to 
Chancellor McElroy this week 
to inquire why he has not 
addressed the Student 
Affirmative Action Commit-
tee's demands of November 
14, 1979. 

- The AS also moved to 
send a letter to the Academic 
Senate in protest of their 
proposal to change the 
add/ drop deadline to the 
fourth week. 

The eIII'Iy ~ation fee deadline is March 17.

commitment," Dunnett laid after the meeting. 

External Affairs commissioner Linda Sabo 
said she wu having difficulty piMing down UC 
President David Saxon on a commibnent to 
have such a vilit. 

"Saxon has been wavering radically on 
campus vilitation. He told someone today that . 
he wasn't lUre they were necessary," Sabo laid, 
and AS President Carlol Montalvo described

"It just has never come up for a vote on the 
learch committee. People are just letting the 
whole thing slide," DUMett noted. 

The committee has said it hopei to have a 
new chancellor by the March Regents meeting, 
which is about three weeks away. 

But Dunnett laid last night she would be 
doing her best to get the selection delay~ until 
April. 

She also said that there were minority and 
women candidates on the final list. 

IPYOU 
If you missed 1957 you missed the Russians launching Sput-
nik I into earth orbit. You missed seeing a young singer 
continue his rise to the top of the record industry with a song 
called Jailhouse Rock. You missed the ballyhooed introduc-

tion of a car called Edsel. And you missed the birth of an 
industry when a group of talented young engin~rs and 

scientists formed the nucleus of Fairchild's 
semiconductor operations. 

Though you missed the beginning, 
you haven't missed the future. Tal-
ent, enthusiasm and hard work 

can take you as far today as it did 
in 1957. Maybe even farther. Today, 

with the vast resources of our parent company, 
Schlumberger Limited, Fairchild is committed to 

technologicalleadersbip and innovation. AQd While 
we're pioneering new technologies, we are also creating 

new career enrichment and em-
ployee benefit programs. 

Fairchild has exciting career openings on 
both the West and East Coasts. 
We'll be on campus in the next 
week or so and would like to talk 
to you about the future. Yours 

and ours. Visit your placement center for the time and 
place. It's an opportunity you won't want to miss.
