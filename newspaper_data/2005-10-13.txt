Teens start sex earlier, report finds 
Sexual taboos waning for modern women 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

A study released by San Diego 
State University cracking the sexual 
rrends of young people over sev-
eraJ decades has found that today's 
youth, particularly young women, 
are more sexually pennissive in 
both their attitudes and actions 
than ever before. 

"Television programs and mov-
ies regularly mention topies such as 

teenage pregnancy, abortion, sexu-
ally cransmitted diseases and rape, 
whereas 30 years ago these topics 
were taboo," the study stated. "This 
shift to more liberal sexual attitudes 
and behaviors, commonly deemed 
the 'sexual revolution,' has dramati-
cally altered American culture." 

The report compiled the find-
ings of 530 different studies con-
cerning tile sexual behaviors and 
attitudes of youth, ranging from 
1943 to 1999, allowing for an

examination of "historical changes 
in young people's sexual behavior 
and attitudes across a large num-
ber of samples coUected over many 
years," it stated. 

Included in the data is the fact 
that young people are having sex 
dramatica lly earlier, with the aver-
age age reaching an all-time low of 
15 years old in 1999. 

"If anything surprised me, it was 
that the average age at first inter-
course was now 15 for both men 
and women," said Jean Twenge, 
San Diego State psychology pro-
fessor and co-author of the study. 
"Before doing this study, I was 
expecting this number to be about 
16 or 17." 

The study also found a heavy 
increase in young people's partici-
pation in oral sex, with rates jump-
ing from 48 percent of young men 
having engaged in oral sex in 1969, 
to 72 percent in 1999. The statistics 
for giving and receiving oral sex are 
slightly more dramatic for women

Warren approves higher 
retreat, internal budget 

By CHARW NGUYEN 
News Editor 

T he Earl Warren College 
Student Council approved thei r bud-
get unanimously last week, which 
included an allocation of $3 ,500 for 
an annual reo-cat for counci l mem-
bers. 

T he reo-eat will last a whole 
weekend at an off-site location , 
which is not an unprecedented 
council plan , according to WCSC 
President Kaoyna Martens. 

The amount is the ab olute high-
est that the council will spend on 
reo-car, which will cost about H 
per person, Martens said. 

"The reo-cats arc such an incred-
ible opportuni ty to bond with peo-
ple you're going to work with for 
the rest of the year," he said. " I've 
spoken to so many adminiso-ators 
and fellow counci l leaders, and they 

all ay that it's imperative to have the 
reo-eat." 

Warren 's student council reo-eat 
is different from the reo-eat held 
by the John Muir College Council, 
according to MCC Chair Neil 
Spears. Muir's reo-eat budget total~ 
$1,700 for three reo-eats thr ughout 
the year. J lowcvcr, MCC pends 
more on their reo-eats than is actu-
ally allocated, as it receives addi-
tional funding from sources such 
as Residential Life. College council 
reo-cats serve a greater purpose of 
building cohesiveness for college 
council ' , a cording to pear;. 

The Warren Student Council 
allocated 9,000 to its internal hud-

Study connects gender, 
ethnicity to spirituality 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
News Editor 

Gender and ethnicity go hand in 
hand with religious beliefs, accord-
ing to a new study by the Higher 
Education Research Institute at 
UCLA. 

The report, titled "Spirituality 
in Higher Education: A National 
Study of College Students' Search 
for Meaning and Purpose," found 
large disparities regarding spiritua l 
involvement between races. T he 
study's data came from a survey 
that was initially developed as a 
four-page questionnaire and admin-
istered to just a sample of college 
juniors in spring 2003, according 
to the study's co-principal investi -
gator, Alexander Asti n. Ilowcver, 
the survey was launched full -scale 
last fall, and was administered to 
112,232 freshman snldents at 236 
institutions. 

Of the students surveyed, the 
majority - 76 percent - were 
white, whi le 8 percent were black, 7 
percent were Asian, 5 percent were 
Latino, 2 percent were American 

Indian and I percent were Pacific 
Islander. T he survey found blacks 
to be far more engaged with reli -
gion and spirituality than other non-
white students, according to Astin, 
who al 0 is founding director of 
J JERl . Almost all blacks surveyed 
professed a belief in Cod, at 95 
percent. Ilowever, the report found 
that Asians rated among the lowest 
in that category, with 65 percent 
saying they believed in Cod. As a 
whole, Asians were found to be the 
most likely to he religious skeptics, a 
II E RI press release stated. 

The study found that race is abo 
connected to which type of religion 
students practiced, with 47 percent 
of black students surveyed identify-
i11g themselves as baptists. 

The practice of certain religions 
might have cono-ibuted to certain 
levels of religiosity. 

"We've fou nd that Baptists are 
normally more involved in [spiri -
nlal] and religious practices," study 
researcher Jennifer Lindholm sa id.

UCSD junior crowned 

u.s. Miss World 
UCSD junior Lisette Diaz was 

honored with the u.S. Miss World 
crown, placing her in the posi-
tion of representing the nation in 
the Miss World pageant in Sanya, 
China, on Dec. 10, according to a 
university press release. 

The pageant, themed '8eauty 
with a Purpose: has raised more 
than $250 million in charitable 
contributions, Dial's win nets her 
a prize package of $20,000, while 
the winner of the Miss World pag· 
eant will receive a prize package of 
$100,000. Diaz has participated in 
the beauty pageant circuit before, 
including being crowned Miss San 
Ysidro in 2003 and competing in 
seven other pageants. Currently at 
UCSD, Diaz is majoring in English 
and literature, and hopes to use 
her education to teach, according 
to the release. 

The Miss World pageant spe-
cifically focuses on community ser-
vice, requiring contestants to raise 
funds for the International Red 
Cross. Contestants in the world 
pageant come from more than 
140 countries and the event is 
broadcast to over 2.2 billion peo-
ple worldwide. 

HiJh schoolers 
def.cient in math 
A study released by the National 

Center for Education Statistics 
showed a disparity between high 
school seniors' higher education 
expectations and their skills. 

While more than two-thirds 
of 2004 high school seniors 
expressed hope to obtain their 
bachelor's degree, almost two-
thirds of those students showed a 
below average level of mathemat-
ics understanding. 

Also, the report found that 
almost a third of students had 
trouble continually solving simple 
arithmetic problems that required 

basic understanding of mathemati-
cal theory. 

Still, the report concluded that 
today's students are education-
ally determined, with 35 percent 
planning to obtain a graduate or 
professional degree, while over 33 
percent of all students surveyed 
expect to stop their education after 
obtaining a four-year degree. 

In addition, over 60 percent of 
students in the report said they 
anticipated attending a four-year 
university after high school. 

Over 22 percent expected to 
enroll at a community college, 
while 8 percent planned to attend 
a vocational or trade school. 

According to the study, aspira-
tions for graduate school degrees 
rank highest among female stu-
dents, with over 41 percent of 
women expecting to go beyond 
baccalaureate education. 

Only 28.8 percent of male stu-
dents expected the same level of 
education. 

Racially, over 47 percent of 
Asian students wanted to have a 
graduate school degree, the high-
est percentage of all ethnicities, 
while Latino students ranked the 
lowest in educational expecta-
tions.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE Religion: Follow ... up survey to come in 2007 
A.S. Meeting .s - Oct. 12 

Public Input 
John Muir College Sophomore 

Senator John Polkinghorne 
announced his immediate resigna-
tion from the A-S. Council because 
"[his] heart is no longer in it" and he 
deemed it in the council's best inter-
est to have a completely involved 
senator take his place. 

Muir alumnus Bryan Barton 
told the counci l that he was forc-
ibly removed from campus after 
an A-S. counciImember called the 
police when he wa.s running a voter 
registration booth. Barton asked the 
council to consider sponsoring his 
proposed voter outreach bill. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 

74, 75 and 76, respectively. Some 
councilmembers objected to voting 
on these resolutions without study-
ing them in detail, and ultimately 
decided another week was necessary 
to understand the issues in their 
entirety. 

Reports 
Commissioner of Programming 
Eric Morris 

Morris responded to Barton's 
earlier statement, saying that 
Banon's booth was removed becaLSe 
of inappropriate event management 
and that the police were only called 
when Barton refused to leave vol-
untarily. He went on to urge the 
council to not endorse Ba rton 's leg-
islation because he believed Banon 
would "only use it for his own per-
sonal gain."

be a major reason why African 
Americans are very religious." 

The survey was organized into 
12 tactors, which included levels 
of spirituality and participants' 
involvement in religious activities.· 

HERI researchers plan to 
administer a follow-up survey to 
the same students in spring 2007 to 
record changes in religious trends. 

While they have no solid 
expectations, researchers do antici-
pate a drop in religious activities, 
Lindholm said. 

"We've seen it in past longi-
tudinal studies that religion has 
fallen off the map, for whatever 
reason, as students get older," she 
said. "Religious activities such 
as pr-ayer are less frequent, and 
students become less inclined to 
answer larger que tions such as, 
'Why am r here?' and 'Mat is my 
purpose?'" 

The survey also showed that 
men were much more likely to be 
skeptical of religion than women. 
The largest gaps between men and 
women were in categories of chari-
table involvement and religious 
commitment. 

"The project is based in part 
on the realization that the rela-
tive amount of attention that col-
leges and universities devote to the 
'exterior' and 'interior' aspects of 
students' development has gonen 
out of balance," Astin stated in 
the report. "We have increasingly 
come to neglect the student's inner 
development - the sphere of val-
ues and beliefs, emotional maturity, 
spirituality and self-understand-
ing." 

Astin and IIERI researchers 
were actually expecting greater 
gender differences in religion than 
they found , Astin said. Initial sur-
veys of college juniors revealed 

a much larger gender difference 
in religious beliefs than the cur-
rent survey of freshmen, Lindholm 
said. 

The report also suggested that 
students who are more spiritual 
have bener psychological well 
being. Of the students surveyed, 58 
percent of students who rated high 
in spirituality said they "frequently 
felt at peace/centered, n while only 
18 percent of students who rated 
low in spirituality said the same. 

Religiously engaged students 
also havc better physical health, 
according to the report. Forty-one 
percent of highly en&'llged religious 
students said they maintained a 
healthy dict. In comparison, 33 
percent of students who were not 
religiously engaged said they had a 
healthy dict.

ItemH 
After being deferred from last 

week's meeting, a proposed revi-
sion to the A.S. Council contract 
with appliance company Micro 101 
solution was passed by consensus, 
following recommendation from 
the internal committee. This revi-
sion would remove the exclusivity 
clause from the contract, allowing 
the council to seek similar refrig-
erator, free'L.Cr and microwave units 
from other vendors should Micro 
101 be unable to "meet the demand 
in a timely fashion." 

Council Caucus 
The council discussed the under-

graduate experience survey, which 
highlighted areas of campus life 
undergraduates found least satisfac-
tory, and how the A.S. Council could 
help address some of the problem 
areas indicated by the survey.

the council allocated $2,700, but 
ended up spending $5,016. The 
council is largely funded by a stu-
dent fee referendwll of $4 per stu-
dent per quarter, which amounts to 
$52,800 this year. Last year, unpre-
dictable costs caused overspend-
ing, but the boost to tlle inter-
nal budget this year will give the 
council more options, according to 
Warren College Student Activities 
Coordinator Brian J. Willess. 

"It's not unreasonable to put 
that amount in internal," he said. 
"There are a lot of things you can't 
see the cost of, like van rentals, 
phone bills and copies. But because 
it is in internal, if the money is 
needed elsewhere, the legislative 
board can vote to spread the money 
elsewhere. "

Because the council cannot 
request any more funds from out-
side sources, having a larger inter-
nal budget allows the council Aex-
ibility, Martens said. 

There also was a carry-over 
windfall of $12,195, which trans-
lated into increased spending to 
the internal and Warren 1hmsfcr 
and Commuter Coalition budgets, 
which should be a major focus of 
the council's finances, Willess said. 

Currently, the budget has allo-
cated $14,800 to wrcc, a rise 
from $7,500 last yea r. Warren 
College has one of (he largest 
erlrollments of transfer students, as 
over 73 percent of Warren studcnts 
commute or are transfer students, 
according to Martens. 

"The organi7.ation has qua-
drupled in si7..e," she said. "The 

importance of transfer and com-
muter student life made my deci-
sion pretty easy." 

The expanded intern:. I budgct 
was a result from last year's experi-
ence, which was the first time the 
council had hmds from the fcc 
referendum, Martens said. 

"Last year was more of an exper-
iment," she said. "I would rather 
have money there to spend than 
allocate less and end up spending 
money that's not there." 

The internal budger is much 
larger thi year bc<''3use funding 
for "Welcome Week," which costs 
$4,000, was moved into the inter-
nal budget from the Events Bmlrd, 
which received the funds last year.

eReserves tied to weak 
intellectual property law 
UCSD's current rum-pusoveritselectron-IC reserves, a differ-
ent side of the music piracy 
coin, represents merely a 
single battle in the war to 
maIntain America's crum-
bling intellecrual property 
regime. It's a war that will 
likely not find a satisfactory 
entente any time soon, 

At issue is a set of federal 
copyright protections, craft-
ed in the age of the written 
word. With the advent of 
digital media, these protec-
tions will continue to erode 
unless lawmakers take the 
initiative necessary to adapt 
the law to the needs of the 
digital generation. 

Fornmately, a coalition 
of education and publish-
ing leaders seems to be tak-
ing the initiative, ,and their 
eventu al propos.al will likely 
serve as the baSIS of a more 
robust regulation. In the 
meantime, th ough, pub-

li~hl:r~ must turn to tech-
nological innovation - like ' 
AdObe 's pro tected PDFs 
- to stem the tide of copy-
right theft, not courts and 
threats. 

Any new proposal must 
delicately achieve a bal-
ance between two com-
peting objectives: incen-
tives for new discovery and 
universal accessibility to 
knowledge. As publishers 
rightly argue, intellectual 
property and the royalties 
It orings, encourages new 
scholarship. However, they 
overstate the threat of the 
public domain: Most aca-
demics will agree that they 
work for the love of the 
profession, not the mea-
ger payoffs of highly spe-
cialized and largely unread 
books and journals. 

Legislative reforms must 
reflect this realit;r, not the 
"Chicken Little' rhetoric 
of publishers. 

The debate over eRe-
serves will not be settled any 
time soon, largely becau e 
both ides can find hints 
of suppo rt in the current 
ambi guous law. Congress, 
not the University of 

alifornia nor the American 
Association of Publi shers, 
will eventua lly offer the 
final resolution. We hope 
it's sooner ratller than later. 

RIAA suits are dying 
breaths of an industry 

A} the latest round of lawsuits comes down 
rom the Recording 

Indu try Association of 
America to another grouf 
of anonymous students, it s 
hard not to feel that the 
whole thin~ has become 
routine - Just as "illegal" 
downloading is for many 
you ng people. While the 
music IJ1dustry knifes its 
would-be customers in the 
back with legal trouble, the 
reality is that their way of 
producing, marketing and 
selling music does not work 
in today's high-tech world. 

Only a few years ago, it 
wasn't hard to see the pur-
pose of traditiona l major 
labels. Though they were 
run by media giants who 
saw artists and custom-
ers mostly as mediums for 
making profits, their deep 
pockets were necessary to 
pay for expensive record-
mgs, elaborate marketing 

and the actual production 
and distribution of CDs. 

But technology has 
changed all that. It's now 
far easier to download a 
song than it is to drive 
to the record store. Near 
studio-quality, multitrack 
recording is available to 
anyone with a fast com-
puter and $50. And the 
Internet, with its message 
boards, blogs and fan sites, 
lets music fans find the 
songs they want - rather 
than telling them. 

The question is: Why do 
people need a major music 
Industry (basically only four 
companies) demanding 
high prices for relatively 
few options? Technology 
has already changed the 
way people produce and 
listen ' to recorded music 
- most would say for the 
better. Lawsuits may be a 
nuisance, but they will not 
shift public will.

Preventing student suicides hinges 
on education, openness and meds 

By ROBIN MARIE AVERBECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

I t happens every ycar - you pick up the paper to see the face of a fcllow student who has commit-ted suicide. The stories are always sad, shocking 
and conspicuously devoid of answers; friends and 
family express their shock at a loved one's suicide, 
saying that they did not know that the victim was so 
depressed. The storics give few detai ls of what was 
really happcning in the student's

neurotransmitter serotonin , which seems to cause or 
contribute to impulsivity and serious depression. 
Mon:over, 90 percent of suicide victims suffer 
from a treatable disorder, and th e vast majority of 
students who seek psychological services through 
their university - 80 to 90 percent, according to 
Juarez - improve and eventually recover from their 
depression. It seems depression ca nnot be easily 
isolated to a single cause - such as social ostracism 
or school stress - but is a complicated psychologi-

ca l, physical and personal ordeal that 
nevertheless, according to Juarez, has 
high rates of recession when sufferers 
seek help. 

li fe, or clues as to why the stu-
dent may have resorted to suicide. 
Killing oneself remains one of the 
most difficult behaviors to explain, 
making its prevention a complex 
and difficult task. 

In general, it seems Although many students either 
attend therapy or know people who 
do, admitting to depression and seek-
ing help does not have the same stig-
ma it used to, [n understanding suicide 
as the last, horrible consequence of 
depression or other disorders, it is 
important that no aspect of the treat-
ment process becomes stigmatized or 
taboo - including medication. Many 
individuals are ashamed to admit they 
are on anti-depressa nts and consider 
their prescription as a kind of failure. 
Our society is far from understanding 
depression as a largely physical illness, 

According to Reina Juarez, 
thc dircctor of Psychological and 
Counseling Services at UCSD, 
there are an estimated I, I 00 student 
suicides each year in the United 
States, about two of which are at 
UCSD. While not a large number, 
it's consistency leaves many won-
dering what the university'S role 
should be in dealing with suicides 
- and if the university system has a 
particular effect on them. 

unlikely that any 
individual could be 
driven to take his (]I' 
her life merely - ar 

mosuy-on 
account of academic 

pressure. " 
For example, many suspect 

that school stress contributes to student suicide. 
However, there is little evidence to support this 
idea. Suicide among students is conspicuously lower 
than thc rest of the population in that age group. 
Secondly, Juarez reports that Psychological Services 
rarely finds school stress to be a significant factor 
in a student's depression, although occasiona lly it 
can be an agitator. In general, it seems unlikely that 
any individual could be driven to take his or her 
life merely - or mostly - on account of academic 
pressure. 

However, one characteristic that Juarez says 
almost all suicide victims do share i low levels of the 

comparable with many other diseases, 
The longer this stereotype persists, the more people 
will deny themselves help because of embarrassment 
or a sense of shame connected with medications that 
are intended to solve a problem not fully under their 
control. Many view medication as "unnatural" or 
a cheap fix to a problem, and cracks about Prozac 
and stereotyping individuals on such medications 
as "crazy" are still common. T hese attitudes drive 
sufferers to continue on without medication, leaving 
what is often a very physical problem unchecked and 
untreated .

Lines in 
the sand 

Ian s. Port 

'n
ey say the all-important 

line has moved in the last 
few years. Local politicos 

used to draw it at Interstate 8, but 
they now say it's moved to the 52. 

That line - a tried-and-true 
tool in this town - roughly divides 
the city of San Diego into two parts; 
places where people are interested 
in what's going on at City Hall , and 
places where people aren't. 

The division is obviously not 
merely geographic: Even in Little 
Italy or Clairemont, it can be hard 
to find anyone who mows - or 
cares - about city politics. But 
"that old 1-8 line," as local strate-
gists call it, illustrates an interest-
ing point, one that will likely have 
a huge effect on who the next 
mayor is; Political participation in 
America's Finest City is at best 
spotty. At worst, it's practically des-
potism. And geography does seem 
to have something to do with it. 

This is important when judg-
ing candidates whose campaigns 
are focused around an absurd ly 
complex problem at City Hall . 
Jerry Sanders and Donna Frye are 
now busy touting their somewhat 
detailed plans for "fiscal recovery" 
(a euphemism for what ought to 
be something of a revolution down 
there), but how many of the voters 
whose disinterest put us here know 
enough about the problem to pick 
the best solution? 

My guess is not many. 
So let's have a little necessary 

fun, and look at the candidates and 
their plans from the perspective 
that will likely count the most: the 
idiot's. 

(Of course nearly everyone, 
including the author, is something 
of an idiot when it comes to actu-
ally understanding this problem. If 
you want to hear about unfunded 
liability and pension obligation 

" [T]he Sanders plan 
appears to be 

constructed in arder 
to appeal especially 

to uninformed voters 
- people who dan't 
know, for irutance, 
that members of the 
City Council have 

already said publicly 
that they won't back 

filing far 
bankruptcy. " 

bonds, read VoiceofSanDiego.org. 
[ don't want to depress you any 
more than I have to.) 

Sanders-a Claus 
Appearance is everything in 

America's Finest City - can't 
you tell by all the fake boobs and 
chrome spinners? Sanders wears 

big smiles and fine, pinstriped suits. 
If he isn't Santa Claus minus the 
beard and hat, he's a classically 
round, jolly, big-city mayor. (Plus 
three points.) Sanders released his 
plan in chapters so he could hold 
a press conference for each one, 
like holiday presents for the voters, 
(plus one point.) 

There's also a magical element 
to his plan, which sort of says that 
because it's him trying to fix the 
city, and not anyone who's already 
trying, all the warring parties will 
finally agree and give up money, 
their egos and whatever else will 
be best for the voters. (plus three 
points for the godlike agenda.) 
He says he'll threaten bankruptcy, 
though he doesn't seem at all seri-
ous, and mows he wants to layoff 
"up to 10 percent" of city employ-
ees (plus 10 points - that's a made-
for-TV line aimed at the city's gobs 
of outlying right-wingers.) 

Other main Sanders points: ask-
ing workers to pay more of their 
health care costs, contracting out 
city services to the private sector, 
raising the retirement age - you get 
the idea. In our imaginary model, 
the soccer moms of above-the-Iine 
Rancho Bernardo are applaudjng in 
their Suburbans. "This guy sounds 
great! The government screwed up, 
and he wants to gut it! Give those 
greedy, union workers what they 
deserve! Muahahaha!" 

OK, OK. T he point is that the 
Sanders plan appears to be con-
structed in order to appeal espe-
cially to uninfonned voters - peo-
ple who don't know, for instance, 
that members of the City Council 
have already said publicly that they 
won 't back filing for bankruptcy.

Port: Frye's honesty and humility obvious ~ I LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 
continued fr011l page 5 

Sanders' plan nced them to at 
least look like they will acrually do 
it, or else he doesn't have any bar-
gaining power with union leaders. 
If the counci l doesn't want to play 
his game, he has no way to get rid 
of the pension increases that drove 
the city broke. 

Sa~dcrs strategy will probably 
be an effective one: Sell the voters 
a plan that asks very little of them. 
Blame the mess entirely on the 
city, the cou ncil and the unions, 
and let [he peuple who don't care 
to continue not c'lri ng. That's 
probably what they want, right? 

Freaky Frye 
Councilwoman f<rye speaks in 

a deep, weathered voice. It isn 't 
pretty, but it is real - and people 
listen to it. Think of tllis as a 
metaphor for her entire campaign, 
right down to the messy, vol-
unteer-dogged headquarters. For 
her supporters, the aesthetic indif-
ference is part of the candidate's 
charm: She's a politician, not a 
movie star. 

Btlt the disarming humility 
and honesty (that even her oppo-
nents won't deny) doesn't come 
across in the TV ads ... because 
tllere aren't any. (On our idiot's 
scorecard, coum Frye down an 
infinite number of points.) Unlike 

Sanders, who doesn't have any 
public record and therefore has 
to he judged almost exclusively 
by what he plans to 00, Frye has 
years of public service as a eoun-
cilmember to talk about - which 
isn't necessa rily good. Sanders is 
using her council seat as a rea-
son she shouldn 't be trusted, even 
though Frye was for years the 
sole vote against the resolutions 

" For her supporters, the 
aesthetic indifference is 

part of the 
candidate's charm: 

She's a politician, not 
a movie star. II 

that brought on this current pain. 
(Minus three points for Frye, 
because having one guy say on 
TV that she's part of the problem 
is probably more effective than 
all the real-person prowess in the 
world.) 

Her plan, like Sanders', relies 
on the City Council - but not to 
threaten bankruptcy. Frye wants 
the council to vote to give her the 
power to fix the problems herself 

..:.... be it through bargaining, bank-
ruptcy or more ballot measures 
- with a heavy dose of input from 
the people. If the council won't do 
what she wants, Frye will ask for 
an initiative to get things done. 
(Plus a half point for the woman 
who was originally against the 
strong-mayor idea .) 

But Ftye's real problems in 
Superficial-Diego starr and end 
with the "A" word . As good as 
her plan may be, as charming and 
accessible as she has been, Frye 
got to city government by way of 
environmental activism. Minus 15 
points for her - can't you feel 

uzie Suburban quaking in her 
traffic jam? Local businesspeople 
are certainly busting their tight 
collars with fear that Frye will 
bring commercial life to halt with 
a tree-hugger's holocaust. 

So there you have it: a slick 
Santa versus the rough-edged 
environmentalist. How sad if it 
actually comes down to those ste-
reotypes, but this is San Diego, 
where we should all know not to 
get our hopes up.

HR3893 anathema to

Dear Editor: 

The passing of HR3893 
(Gasoline for America's Security 
Act of 2005) on Oct. 7 makes the 
need for new leadership clear-
er than ever. Instead of drafting 
legislation that could actually be 
used to solve the problem of our 
nation's dependency on a rap-
idly diminishing energy source, 
212 Republican members of the 
House of Representatives man-
aged to narrowly pass a bill that 
was opposed not only by environ-
mental organizations, but even 
13 members of their own party, 
among numerous other organiza-
tions. Using Hurricanes Katrina 
and Rita as excuses, the bill's sup-
porters claim that the need for 
more refineries gives them the 
right to override state and envi-
ronmental standards, while giv-
ing breaks to oil companies. The 
bill does nothing to decrease oil 
prices, only hindering the ability 
of officials to ensure clem air by 
loosening the restrictions of the 
Clean Air Act. No Democrats 
voted for this bill, which seelcs 
only to further damage the eco-

Medication 

often viewed 
as cheap fix 

cominlUd from page 4 
However, emotional sup-

port and a caring environment 
are equally crucial. According to 
Juarez, most suicide victims did 
not have many close and lov-
ing relationships. Psychological 
counseling can be crucial in such 
cases. 

Ultimately, there seems to be 
some individuals whom even cam-
pus psychological services have dif-
ficulty saving. According toJuarez, 
about 15 percent of suicide victims 
were in treatment at the time of 
their suicide. Even with the ben-
efits of modern understanding and 

" Student suicide rates have 
been decreasing in the 

past decade, largely due to

services being mare acces-
sible. II 

science, suicidal tendencies remain 
something that cannot necessar-
ily b!! easily treated. Openness 
and understanding are going to 
be a lot more helpful than blame. 
Psychological counselors try their 
best to reach people before trag-
edy - the recent awa reness drive 
of last week is such an example 
- and they are making a differ-
ence. Student suicide rates have 
been decreasing in the past decade, 
largely due to such services grow-
ing more accessible. 

Suicide is one of the most 
poignant tragedies possible, even 
more so than homicide, as it seems 
even more unnecessary. For a soci-
ety to truly grapple with the prob-
lems that lead to depression, we 
have to start by not being afraid 
of its symptoms. With any luck, 
through education and openness, 
many potential suicide victims may 
realize they are not alone, and feel 
free to seek help and hope.

Committee members are required 
to sign an agreement at orienta-
tion that states that they will accu-
rately represent the views of the 
A.S. Council, which represents the 
student body. Although repre en-
tatives are not required to report 
every decision to the council, they 
are required to submit reports to 
Fornero and keep updated on A.S. 
Council resolutions. 

The agreement, instinlted last 
year by former VP Internal Cat 
Yapyuco, is a procedure that the 
current council will continue with 
its committee representatives, 
Fornero sa id. 

According to Murphy, this 
policy is necessary to help the A.S. 
Council ca rry Out its responsibili-
ties to the student body. 

"It is important that .S. is 
accountable to the students, and 
to ensure that accountability, we 
need to be able to trust Ithat] 
the repre entatives we appoint 
will ca rry out the decisions of the 
council," Murphy said. 

Critics such as Charles Dahan, 
the former A.S. representative to 
R}i\C, have argued that the oath 
restricts the representatives, who 
act as experts on the issues their 
committee deals with, from being 
able to act on the spot in the best 
interest of the student body. 

Limiting representatives' abil-
ity to e~press their opinions does 
not diminish their effective func-
tioning, Murphy said. 

"We encourage all schools of 
thought and a diversity of opin-
ion," Murphy said. "However, 
when there is a critical issue that 
the A.S. has a vested interest in, it 
is important that we can trust our 
appointed representatives to advo-
cate on behalf of the A.S." 

A.S. representatives on UCSD 
committees play an integral role 
in shaping campus in ways the 
council advocates, Murphy said. 

"We expect the representatives 
we appoint to repon back to us 
with the necessary information 
and their own opinions so that 
we may view all the resources 
available and corne up with what 
we believe is the best course of 
action," Murphy said. 

The oath requirement, tlsed 
since last year and now being 
enforced, arose as the result of an 
incident in 2004 involving Dahan's 
actions on RFAC, the university 
committee charged with helping 
to allocate $400,000 a year to 
student and campus groups such 
as Psychological and CouJ1Seling 
Services and tudent Ilealth 
Services, Murphy said. 

Dahan wrote a letter in May 
2004 to the Guardian about the 
Triton Taxi program, now called 
A.S. Safe Rides. In the letter, 
Dahan expre sed objections to 
tile A.S.-funded program, which 
provides transportation for stu-
dents, and which he felt facilitated 
underage drinking at off-campus 
locations. 

The council dismissed Dahan 
as its representative and evenUl-
ally implemented its current oath 
policy, Murphy said. 

"We encourage our represen-
tatives to formulate their own 
opinions," Murphy said. "But he 
signed the letter using his title as 
an A.S. representative, giving the 
impression that he was speaking 
for the A.S. when, in fact, he was 
not." 

However, Dahan said that his 
dismissal from the RFAC was 
the result of ideological differ-
ences over where committee funds

leaders of the future . 

hould go. 
"I differed on a number of 

funding issues," Dahan said. 
"Primarily, I encouraged hiring 
a campus psychiatrist rather than 
funding entertainment-focused 
activities." 

The Trilon Taxi letter was an 
excuse for the council to remove 
him, Dahan said. 

"Triton Taxi funding has noth-
ing to do with the RFAC, and I 
included my title due to a refer-
ence in the article to my work on 
the RFAC," Dahan said." a one 
to whom I spoke - other than 
[former A.S. President] Jenn Pac 
- was confused by my listing of 
my title." 

The council voted to remove 
Dahan from RFAC and appoint-
ed P'lC in his place. Dahan said 
exchanges between councihnem-
bers made it ubviotls that personal 
differences lcd to his ejection from 
the RFAC. 

"It was made clear to me 
through e-mails over the A.S. list-
serv that my ideological disagree-
ments - that the RFAC should 
prioritize student medical services 
above funding for entertainment 
activities - was the reason for my 
removal," Dahan said. 

The oath requirement for A.S. 
representatives will not change 
the way that RFAC or any other 
committee operates, according to 
Murphy. 

"The structure or general 
process of how fRJo'ACj runs has 
not been changed by this [oath] 
because A.S. is not the body 
in charge of this committee," 
Murphy said. "We merely appoint 
a representative to it."

"Abstinence-only edu(:ation isn't 
giVillg kids all the infonnation that 
they need," Wells said. "There 's 
been a rise not only in oral sex but 
in anal sex as well. If you plan on 
keeping your vaginal virginity, which 
is all that has been taught, then you'll 
resort to altemate fornls of sexual 
expression. " 

Education is important to explor-
ing sexuality, especially at a yOUllg 
age, Wells said. 

The snldy tr:lcks not only sexual 
practices but also atOUldcs, such as 
feelings of sexual guilt and views on 
premarital sex, and changes were 
more dramatic for women than for 
men. 

"Women have social value now 
as members of the public society ... 
'0 as their value in broader tenns 
increases there's less of a concern 
about their sexual purity," said Mary 
Blair-Loy, professor of sociology 
and director of graduate sUldie at 
UCSD. "Purity is no longer their 
only selling point." 

Over the cou.rsc of five decades, 
the number of women who approve 
of premarital sex has increased dras-
tically. As of 1999, 73 percent of 
women felt the practice to be accept-
able. In 1943, however, the numbers 
were quite different, with only 12 
percent of women deeming the act 
appropriate. This 61 percent rise 
is much higher than that recorded 
among men, which saw an increase 

Wells also attributed some of the 
changc-~ to the increased presence of 
contraceptives. 

"The sexual revolution and femi-
ni m ... these changes are definitely 
culrural," Wells said. "Birth control 
also helped a lot to level the playing 
field between men and women . ... 
There's much less of a gap now." 

The changes in the trends of sex-
ual practice and behavior were exam-
ined in tile context of otller I!vent~ 
within the dcsigmlted time frame, 
including the onset of A.I.D.S. and 
a ri~ing dil'orce rate. \Vith .I.DS, 
tile study found thut, as the number 
of people affected by the epidemic 
heightened, younger people repon-
ed fewer numbers of sexual partners. 
Also, the increasing divorce rate par-
alleled an incre:t~e in sexual prac-
tices and behaviors of youth. The 
suldy also examined the hypothesis 
of whether a sexually conservative 
trend ()(:curred in the I 980-90s after 
tile "pe,lk of the sexual revolution" 
in the 1960s. The sUldy did not sup-
port the hypothe is. 

"People have tile perception that 
the sexual revolution happened in 
the late '60s and '70s, but we defi-
nitely found that this change contin-
ued into the '80s and '90s," Twengc 
said. 

Sexual permissiveness steadi ly 
increased throughout the decades 
the snldy found, rather than spiking 
radically during one period of tillle.

As far as pop culture i concerned , John Cage is assured a place in the great tradition of Johns: John ' ''layne, John Malkovich, John(ny) Cash 
and Johnny B. Goode: lI e's remembered as the 
most important aV:lIlt-garde figure in America . 
College studentS may recall from music apprecia-
tion cla ss the work "4'33 "," where Cagc sat behind 
the piano for that duration of time without play-
ing a single norco 

Hut Cage was about more than just writing 
odd pieces of music. li e was also an artist and a 
philosopher, experimenting with language and the 
visual arts. UCS D's University Art Gallery is now 
presenting Cage's other works, along with pieces 
from friends W'illiam Ana tasi, Dove Bradshaw 
and Merce Cunningham. Anastasi and Bradshaw 
became particularly close with Cage during the 
last 15 yea rs nfhis life. 

The last half of the 10th cenn lry aware! for 
"Criminally Underrated" surely belongs to 
Anastasi. Whil e Cage explored the idea of chance 
in music and composition, n3sta i did the same 
with visual art. li e would turn off all the lightS 
in the room and draw circular lines on his canva 
for hours in a meditative phase and then view the 
results. Ln another one of his "blind drawings," 
Anastasi would draw as he listened to Bach 's 
" ' Veil-Tempered KJavier." A~ he explaincd it, he 
was trying to disconnect the motions of his hand 
from the rhythmic nature of "Wcll-Tempered ." 
Mas[cring his technique of reaching nirvana 
through bli nd drawing to the recording, Anastasi 
then extended his musical soundtrack to a ride on 
the subway. 

Bradshaw's works, on the othe r hand, embody 
a fasci nation with different chemicals, such as 
sulfur and saltS. T he ga llery also features another 
crucial figure in Cage's life, Cunningham, a cho-
reographer whose theater and dance works are

Directed by Bennett Miller 
Rated R 

{~I-RE-~~_Im 
mentary-like manner, the film plays 
out in Illuch the sa me way as the 
engro sing novel: first introducing 
the crime and establishing a strong 
empathetic connection to both the 
writer and the criminals, and finally 
working toward a brutally moving 
resolution in which details of the 
crill1e arc revealed and the murder-
ers arc executed.

All fluff, no feeling in Crowe's southern romance 
By OAKLEY ANDERSON-

MOORE 
Senior Staff Writer 

I'm convinced that when Cameron Crowe wrote "Eli za bethtown ," 
llo llywood producers-by-
day vampires-by-nighr must 
have snatched th e origi na l 
copy from his desk, drained 
much of the worth from 
it, and replaced th e fin -
ished film in Mr. Crowe's 
LOp drawer, along with a 
case of hallucinogenic bran-
dy that would causc him 
nor to notice the changc. I 
think this happens a lot in 
ll ollywood. 

Poor Crowe - he wanted 
rhe film to be inspired hy his 
own return to Kentucky for 
hi s father 's fun eral. ' Vhen 
he made "Almost Farnou ," 
he also used personal events 
from his life, which lead to 
a clever, poignant film. But 
this time around , Crowe 
replaced poignancy wirh 
perpetual fluffiness and an 
insolent lack of believabil-
ity. 

There's a producer-va m-
pire handbook dlar Illan y stu-
dios use to make films, ,1nd it 
seems someone a t Paramount 
convi need Crowe to refer-
ence this chapter on how to 
rum a since re, personal story 
into a generic blockbuster: 

a) Cast the two hot-

Elizabethtown 

** Stamng Kirsten Dunst and 
Orlando Bloom 

Dlreaed by Cameron Crowe 
Rated PG·13 

Courtesy 0' Paramount Pictures 
Happy together: Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst) attempts to rescue 
Drew Ba00r (Orlando Bloom) from suicide in "Elizabethtown.' 
test faces in Ii ollywood as 
the lead roma ntic inter-
es ts. ( eve r mind that the 
Bri ti sh elf ca n'r act or add 
to the integrity of the stOry 
about .. man comi ng back 
to his KfII/llck y roots - the 
film will have' mass sta rdom 
appeaL) 

h) Turn the movie into a 
mu~ic video. (Don 't let the 
audience go for more than 
10 seconds with out hearing 
a c;ltchy pop or rock song 
telling them how to feeL) 

c) Let yo ur good inten-
tions take the place of hard 
work. (In other words, 
sit back, read ass- kissing 
reviews from Entertainment 
Weekly and college journal-

ists, and listen to Paramount 
co unt the cash.) 

The basi story is tha t 
Drew Baylor (Orlando 
Bloo m) is going to commit 
suicide upon his renll"ll from 
Kentucky. The audience is 
supposed to root for him, 
hoping that he'll sec the 
goodness of Elizabethtown 
and chan ge hi mind. But 
what Crowe failed to realize 
is that due to his brazen lack 
of realism, no one could rea-
sonably believe that Ba ylor 
would actually kill himself. 
Eve n worse, Baylor fails 
to go through any appar-
ent character transforma-

Fralll Ferdinand 
You Could Have It So Much Better 
Sony 

O verstimulation is a F,lct of life in Americd. Our anention spans are short because our lives are utter-
ly overrun \\~th celebrity pregnancies, 
remote casualty figures and viJltage 
batting averJges. Franz Ferdinand 
- not U2, not the Killers, not the 
Arcade Fire and certainly not the 
Strokes - are tile rock "n' roll band 
of our A. D.D.'ed time Ix.'cause their 
music is pcrlCct overstimulation. 

Take the words of Alex Kapranos 
on YOIl COIlId J Irrve II & Mlleb Bettl'1' 
- a random, titillating title to a bateh 
of songs loaded wim juicy one-liners 
tim pop our like fumiliar Orwellian 
soundbites: "I only resist when people 

***~ insist on taking their hate and placing it 
on your name" and, of course, "You're 
the reason I'm le\Ving." Gripping, off-
the-<:uff and meaningless - cool! Ah, 
but the words are there only to punc-
tuate Ferdinand' signature rhythmic 
impatience (fonnulaic but empirically 
irresistible) an their math rock/disco! 
chest-hair bouquet reeks uncontested 
on this new record. Their musical 
skdeton is starting to show, but who 
bothers with subtlety? I can stOp time 
with my TiVo- but Franz Ferdinand 
are stiU worth my three minutes.

Metric 
live It Out 
Last Gang 

M ettic's second albwn, Live it Ollt, is an acquired rnste. Upon initial listening, the album 
seems homogenous and jrnnbled 
into one 4O-minute indie/punk song 
with singer Emily Haines' aggressive 
voice in the backgrowld. The only 
db1:inguishable ~ at first arc me 
guitarless synthesizer sounds of "loe 
Police and the Private" and "Ending 
Start," which begins with a mysterious 
melody that crescendos into a dreamy 
ballad. While the tunes are not as 
catchy as the songs from their previ-
ous album, the traditioo of troubling 
and thought-provoking lyrics prevails. 
"Patriarch on a Vespa" is an odd song 

*** tide, but has a strong message chal-
lenging WOOlen's traditional roles. It 
ends with the chilling lyric, "Pattiarch 
on a Vespa runs a red and ends up 
crushed under the wheel." "Monster 
Hospital," in addition to its Sin City-
esque music video, SOWlds like a pWlk-
rock anthem with Haines repeating 
defeatedJy, "I fought the war but the 
war won." After several listens, one 
starts to get the gist of what Mettic are 
aU about ThankfuUy, a fun last song, 
the peppy "Live it Out," nearly saves 
the rest of the album.

The Go! Team 
Thunder, Lightning, Strike 
Columbia 

The Go! Tea m is about as self-re fl ective as a group nam e gets. Tbllllde1", LigblTling, SI1,ke seems 
to be structured as an homage to 
the last 20 years of Illusic. The 
group fuses e1cctronica, hip-hop and 
even rock. Blend all that with a 
lettemlan's jacket, smiles and pom-
poms, and boom: The Go! Team. 
Top it off with a marching band led 
by a tenacious group of cheerlead-
ers chanting, clapping and stomping 
from the fresh gras of the South up 
to m e concrete jungles of the Norm. 
It's a fusion of devilishly loud instru-

**** mcnts, Apollonian strings, and rug-
ged hreak-beats splashing and mix-
ing into one anotllcr with the same 
tenacit), as Pollock's bru~h.Who 
nee&, dirty late-night critics and 
analysis chans when you have musi-
cians like The Go! Team? So just 
drop your books, lose the oversized 
su nglasses and bask in the innocent 
sunshine of delight.

Capote: Hoffman treats 
fabled author with respect 

continued from page 8 
homosexual characters. Hoffman 
intuitively conveys the author's 
knack for social comedy, his ego-
tism and his mild-mannered use of 
celebrity and bribes to gain infor-
mation. He comfortably embraces 
Capote's outlandish style and flaw-
lessly trades his resonant baritone 
for Capote's renowned childish 
murmur. 

Hoffman not only resurrects the 
author's trademark physical appear-
ance, but also genuinely embarks 
on an awkard spiral of emotions 
that arise when a writer becomes 
roo emotionally involved with 
his subject. His subject is Perry 
(Clifton Collins, Jr. - solid as a 
social outcast, but missing some 
of the simmering passion and self-
hatred described in the book), the 
enigmatic, perceptive and vulner-
able man who also happen to be 
a killer. After a series of meet-
ings, Capote discovers t11at he has 
a lot in common with Perry and 
becomes his confidant, therapist, 
friend and, perhaps, platonic love. 

Screenwriter Dan Funerm~ aptly 
refrains from imparting a specific 
analysis of Capote's feelings, allow-
ing for an open-ended interpreta-
tion based on Hoffman's portrayal. 

Capote becomes perplexed by 
conflicting desires as he helps the 
murderers when he needs infor-
mation and abandons them when 
he wants to conclude his novel. 
The complex relationship between 
Capote and Perry is quite fascinat-
ing, and Capote's quest to human-
ize a killer has certain provocative 
moral implications that explain the 
depth of the writer's revolutionary 
narrative as well as the breakdown 
he suffers when Perry dies. Capote's 
devastation is superbly realized by 
Hoffman in one of the most truth-
ful and (thankfully) sincere emo-
tional scenes, in which Capote says 
goodbye to Perry, crying honest 
tears while lying to the condemned 
man. The progress toward this 
poignant moment provides ample 
insight into the writer' life and the 
biopic manages to at once captivate, 
amuse, disturb and stimulate.

Four members of the UCSD 
men's tennis team played in the 
Santa Clara University Bronco 
Classic &om Oct. 7 through Oct. 
9. Division ] teams &om across 
the state were present and posed 
formidable competition for the 
Tritons. 

Sophomore Blake Meister and 
seniors Brent Molden, Steven 
Oechel and Eric OijaIa participated 
in both singles and doubles play 
during the tournament. 

In singles play, Oechel lost his 
first match on Oct. 7, falling to UC 
Davis' Henri Landes 3-6, 5-7. 

Molden played twice on the 
first day, posting a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 
win against Falko Hunenberger of 
the University of San Francisco, 
but later losing to Stanford's Blake 
Muller 4-6,3-6. 

Meister also played two singles 

matches on day one, first defeating 
Tarin Ching of the University of 
San Francisco 6-1 ,6-3, then posting 
a 6-3, 6-3 win against the Broncos' 
Kenw Hiralc:awa-Wong. The wins 
advanced Meister to quarterfinal 
play, where he lilced UC Davis' 
Daniel Elefant. Meister engaged 
Elefant in a thrilling three-match 
hout, but eventually lost by scores 
of3-6, 6-3, 4-6. 

Oijala lost his first match 
against Yuri Platonov of St. Mary's 
College with scores of 4-6, 4-6, 
but bounced back and moved on to 
the consolation bracket, where he 
won his next two matches against 
Nevada and Sacramento State. 

His streak ended though in 
the consolation finals against Tore 
Deleuran of UC Berkeley, falling 
3-6,5-7. 

All four of the Tritons also com-
peted in fierce doubles play through 
the weekend. Meister and Molden 
paired up first to IiIce the Stanford 

doubles team, posting an 8-5 win 
to move to the blue quarterfinals. 
Once in the quarterfinals, Meister 
and Molden could not advance past 
the tough competition of Santa 
Clara University, losing 4-8. 

Oechel and Oijala paired up 
against Sacramento State, but 
lost 3-8 in the first round. They 
returned to play in the consolation 
quarterfinals, where they beat UC 
Santa Barbara 8-5. In the con-
solation semifinals, Oechel and 
Oijala came up short, losing 4-8 to 
Stanford. 

Meister and Molden will return 
to the coun OCt. 13 through 
Oct. 16 to participate in the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Association 
National Championships in Fan 
Myers, Fla. The duo qualified at 
the ITA West Regional in Pomona 
earlier this month. The rest of 
the Tritons will return to play on 
Nov. 2 at the Southern California 
Intercollegiates in Los Angeles. 

hit .300 during the regular season. 
Paul Konerko is the only White 
Sox player to get 100 RBIs during 
the regular season. 

Bening on a team whose lineup 
may be only marginally better 
overall than that of the White 
Sox and whose rotation looks far 
worse would be a dicey proposi-
tion. Fortunately, the Gunl'dioll 
does not endorse gambling.

National League 

Championship Series 
Did you know the Astros were 

once 15 games under .500? Did 
you know the St. Louis Cardinals 
have been the best team on the 
planet all year? Did you know 
these two teams met last year in 
a great Championship Series that 
proved Jim Edmonds a Hall-of-
Fame-caliber player? 

Instead, Chris Carpenter 
emerged and, after ending his sea-
son prematurely last year, went 
on to lead the majors in wins and 
will almost assuredly capture the 
Cy Young. 

The strength of the Cardinals 
is not simply a pitching staff that 
includes Carpenter, Mulder and 
three other guys who won at least 
13 games, but a complementary 
lineup that includes Albert Pujols, 
Jim Edmonds, Reggie Sanders, 
Larry Walker, David Eckstein and 
the pride of Hyogo Prefecture, 
Japan, So Taguchi. 

Soccer: Tritons strong offense drowns Otters 

One player everyone does know 
is the ageless Roger Clemens. The 
Rocket has been around so long 
that he actually played with home-
run hitters who were drunks, but 
not druggies. Despire his senior-
ity, Clemens led the league in 
E .R.A. and led his Astros deeper 
into the playoffs than he did any 
of his former teams. 

Last year, these two teams 
duked it out in an epic seven-
game serie . It wouldn't be at all 
strange if they did that again this 
year. Any of the Aseros' top-three 
pitchers, Clemens, Roy Oswalt 
and Andy Pettite, could be a 
definitive number-one starter on 
most other teams, be th.ey fantasy 
or major league. 

Last year, however, it wasn 't 
pitching that got them to seven 
games, but the clutch hitting of 
departed players Jeff Kent and 
Carlos "I Tricked the Mets into 
Paying Me a lot of Money" 
Beltran.

her shots in the second half and 
scored three for the ha t trick. 

Her first goal of the game 
came at the 52-minute marlc, as 
she took a deflected shot from 
junior Heather Sugg and slid 
it past the Cal State Monterey 
Bay keeper for her sixth tally of 
the year. 

Lai's second goal of the game 
came just over 10 minutes later 
when freshman Kelly Mayo slid 
a heel pass behind her to soph-
omore Kathy Sepulveda, who 
flicked it on to Lai, giving the 
Tritons a 3-0 lead. 

In the 67th minute, Lai 
headed home her eighth goal of 
the year off a pass from junior 
Megan Dickey, increasing the 
lead to 4-0. 

Belak-Berger added the team's 
fifth goal six minutes later as she 
put home a header off sopho-
more Caitlin Ryan's comer lcick. 

A mere 30 seconds later, 
junior Sereena Warino caught 
reserve Cal State Monterey Bay 
netrninder Erilc:a Ulfelder out of 
position and lobbed in her first 
career goal at UCSD from 16 
yards out. 

Freshman goalkeeper Mia 

Shirley played 72 minutes of the 
match and made two saves early 
on. 

She gave way to freshman 
Jessica McGovern, who played 
the final 18 minutes and secured 
UCSO's sixth-straight shutout 
and eighth of the year. 

"With three attempted shots 
from the Otters, only two of 
them were slightly on target," 
Cochran said. 

UCSD returns to action next 
week with three matches on the 
road, beginning with a match 
at Cal State Bakersfield on Oct. 
12. 

The Cardinals never really had 
to claw back into the race like the 
Astros, nor did they have to hold 
off charges from division foes like 
the Angels and White Sox. The 
Cardinals, in fact, haven't actually 
played a pressure-filled game in 
about three months. This team 
has simply been built upon con-
sistency, calmness and cool unj-
forms. 

The big acquisition of Mark 
Mulder from the A's was sup-
posed to give the Cardinals a true 
ace who would help to avoid the 

6 VS. 

This year, their batting order 
is so anemic that Clemens was 
used as a pinch-hirter against 
the Braves and is probably good 
enough to hit in the middle of 
the order. It's widely believed that 
pitching wins championships, but 
when it takes you an entire game's 
worth of extra innings to score a 
run, the pitching advantage isn't 
large enough to advance. 

Joe goes with: Cardinals in six.

No. 9 Tritons defeat Otters 6--0 
Five second-half goals extend win streak 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The ninth - ranked UCSD 
women's soccer team exploded 
late in the game for a 6-0 win 
over Cal tate Monterey Bay on 
Oct. 9, scoring five goals in the 
second half. 

Despite the initial lethargy, 
C D ( 11 - 1-0 overall, 7-1-0 

California Collegiate Athletic 
ssociation) was able to out-shoot 

the Ouer by a 16-3 margin in the 
first half. 

"Our defense never let CSUMB 
ge t near the goal," McManus said. 
" I t was an ugly game and we didn't 
play very well the fir t half." 

With less than seven minutes 
left in the first half, junior Alise 
Malley netted her fourth goal of 
the season off a rebounded shot 
from freshman Natasha Belak-
Berger.

. Joe 

Joe Tevelowilz 

I t's that October time again. Time for the announcers to document all the past his-
tory, the sca lpers to raise prices 
to extraordi nary levels and the 
Yankees and Red Sox to engage 
in ye t another classic American 
League Championship Series. 
What? The Red Sox were swept? 
The Yankees went down in five at 
the hands of a 22-year-old rook-
ie? Jessica Alba wants my phone 
number? Well, two out of three 
isn't had ... unless, of course, 
you' re Commissioner Bud Selig, 
ESP ,fox or any of the other 
individuals or corporations hop-
ing to profi t from a Yankees/Red 
Sox series. Apologies if you are 
o ne of those previously listed 
because I'm sure you have been 
banking on both - or at least 
one - in the championship 
series. Unfortunately for you, 
the Red Sox and Yankees' com-
bined $330 million dollar payroll 
bought nothing more than a pair 
of first-round exits. 

However, one man's waste of 
a small (( .ftune is another fan 's 
beautiful lesult. All year, sports 
talk radi o, te levision shows and 
crazy guy~ on the streets have 
been utterly obse sed with the 
Sox and the Yanks. Aside from 
local newspaper coverage of the 
local team, you wouldn't know 

any other teams had even decided 
to playa full schedule this year. 
Every month another HUGE 
Red Sox-Yankees matchup was 
featured , while teams like the 
Cardina ls and White Sox, who 
respectively led the majors and 
the American League in wins, 
were overlooked. Now, with the 
two most overrated teams in the 
league mercifully eliminated, we 
are left to watch great baseball by 
four of the other 28 underrated 
teams. 

American League 
Championship Series 

The two teams responsible 
for the giant-killings now are 
set to meet up. Instead of the 
clash of power and paychecks 
we assumed would take place, 
we get a small-ba ll matchup that 
will be about great pitching, 
great defense and great baseball. 
(Except for the hitting part.) 

The White Sox got off to a 
huge sta rt and had a command-
ing lead in their division until 
the last couple weeks, when the 
C leveland Indians actually made 
it a contest. The pressure the 
Indians put on the White Sox 
seemed to be beneficial, pro-
viding them with meaningful 
and uplifting games to prepare 
a team of mostly inexperienced 
postseason players for a playoff 
atmosphere. Add the second-ha lf 
resurgence of Jose Contreras 
to the solid seasons of Mark 
Buehrle,jon Garland and Freddy 
Garcia and the blazing speed 
of Scott Podsednik, and thjs is 
a team that could legitimately 
make it to the World Series for 

the first time in 46 years. 
The Angels, on the other hand, 

were just in the series three years 
ago, when they improbably beat 
the Giants behind the strength 
of rookie sensations francisco 
Rodriguez and John Lackey. 

Rodriguez is now the Angels 
closer and Lackey will be car-
rying much of the pitching load 
with injuries likely to hamper 
ace Bartolo Colon. This leaves 
22-year-old rookie pitcher Ervin 
Santana as the key to success. 
Santana filled in for Colon after 
the Cy Young candidate was 
unable to make his game-five 
start against the Yanks. Santana 
took care of the collection of 
All-Star hitters en-route to the 
game-five win and now will prob-
ably have to do the same if the 
Angels, be they of Los Angeles, 
Anaheim, Califurnia or Tijuana, 
hope to advance. 

A ra.in-out in New York forced 
the Angels into playing three 
games in three days in three 
different cities, leaving many 
wondering how th.is team, pos-
sibly missing two of their start-
ers, can muster enough energy 
to even compete. Attention must 
be paid to whom they are play-
ing against. The White Sox and 
Angels have been called mir-
ror images of one another with 
their similar small-ball tactics. 
The only djfference is that while 
the Angels had some struggles at 
the plate this year (Steve Finley, 
this means you), the White Sox 
djdn't have a single player who

Men's soccer blanks 
CSUMB in narrow win 
Davey's two goals boost Tritons 

to 8-3-1 overall season record 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 

With the assistance of senior 
Matt Davey's two goals, the No. 
21 UCSD men's soccer team post-
ed a 2-0 shutout over Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Oct. 9 at Triton 
Soccer Stadium. 

After a slow start, the Tritons 
(8-3-1 overall, 5-2-1 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association) 
transformed the rhythm of the 
game after Cal State Monterey 
Bay committed a foul in the box. 

At the 39 minute, 40 second 
mark in the first half, Davey net-
ted hjs eighth goa l of the year on 
a penalty kick after senior Grant 
Nishio was shoved from behind 
in the penalty box. 

The penalty kick gave the 
Tritons a 1-0 lead going into half-
time, and they refused to relin-
quish their advantage during the 
second half. In tead , the Tritons 
doubled their lead . 

Davey rocketed a ball past Cal 
State Monterey Bay goa lkeeper 
Bobby Arteaga from 10 ya rds out 
at the 46:56 mark to give the 
Tritons an insurance goa l. 

Freshman Tom Caplan flicked 
junior Dustin Tannenhaus' throw-
in pass to Davey and was credited 
with an assist. 

" Davey really stepped it up, 
especially with his second goal, 
which helped us a lot," senior 
UCSD goalkeeper Edward 
Ruhland said. 

Ruhland played the first 83 
minutes of the match, posting 
two saves and allowing no goa ls, 
lowering his season goals-against 

average to a miniscule 0.47 per 
game. 

Freshman Luis Salazar played 
the final seven minutes to secure 
the team's sixth shutout of the sea-
son. With the 2-0 win, the Tritons 
have now out-scored their oppo-
nents by a 20-5 margin. 

The game was marred by 27 
fouls, 19 of which were committed 
by Otters. 

Ten cards were assessed dur-
ing the match, two to the Tritons 
and the other eight to Cal State 
Monterey Bay. 

"The game was very aggressive 
and there was a lot of tough play," 
Ruhland said. "Thi game was our 
most physical game yet." 

Sophomore Jake True and 
senior Stephen Lopez of Cal State 
Monterey Bay were each carded 
twice, resulting in red card ejec-
tion late in the second half. 

Despite the convincing vic-
tory, Ruhland felt that there were 
lessons to be learned from the 
game. 

"Though we played pretty well , 
we definitely had some mis ed 
opportunities , especially offen-
sively," Ruhl and said. 

The Tritons lost 1-2 to Cal 
State Bakersfie ld on Oct. 12. 
Details were unavailable at press 
time. 

From there they will continue 
on to face Chico State and Cal 
State Stanislaus on Oct. 14 and 
16, respectively. 

following their long road trip, 
the Tritons will play three more 
regular season games before the 
start of the CCAA playoffs on 
Nov. 4.
