For Rush ' .... Irt 
RIVERSIDE - UC 
Riverside's Inter-Fraternity 
Council imposed sanctions on 
Phi Kappa Sigma last week 
for a t-shirt design that drew 
protests from campus 'Latino 
groups. The controversy 
centered on a Phi Kappa 
Sigma fall rush t-shirt, which 
depicts a person wearing a 
sombrero and holding a bottle 
surrounded by the words, "It 
doesn't matter where you 
come from, as long as you 
know where you are going." 
The design, which some felt 
was derogatory toward 
Chicanos, prompted the IFC 
to rule that Phi Kappa Sigma 
must apologize to the campus 
Latino groups and other 

. fraternities. The fraternity, 
which was placed on proba-
tion for a year, will also have 
to destroy the t-shirt.

SPECIAL PULL-OUT SECTION 

Enrollment 
Declines for 
F all Quarter 
DROP: Number of enrolled 
students drops by 317; bigger 
decline had been expected 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD's enroll me nt will officially drop 
for the firs t ti me in the univer!> ity\ hi!>tory, 
the reg istrar confirmed on Tuesday, How-
ever, the decline in enrollment will not be as 
large as un iversity administrato r~ had origi -
nally anticipated. 

According to the numbers tabulated by the 
registrar, enrollment has dropped by 371 stu-
dents from Fall Quarteroflast year. While the 
decrease is not a small one, it was lower than 
predictions made by the planning office at the 
beginning of this quarter when officials esti-
mated that enrollment could drop by a much 
as 800 students. 

The 
Dominic Lobbla/Guardian 

During Spring Quarter, the Campus Plan-
ning Office anticipated a decrease of about 
400 students, a number that accurately re-
flected the final figure . Accordi ng to Robert 
Starkey of the campus planning oftice. "The 
July update was right-on." 

is Set 

The actual drop from 18,2~ 1 students to 
17,870 over the las t year has generated 
several different ex planations, "The reason 
for that [drop J was our ex tremely large 
graduating class," sa id acting Registrar Sally 
Hickok. ' 

During the 1992-93 academic year, UCSD 
awarded a record 2,947 diplomas, compared 
to the previous year's 2,256. 

THURGOOD MARSHALL COLLEGE will officially be dedicated in a 
special ceremony tomorrow. Mter a 23-year search, the forme r Thi I'd 
College gains a name worthy of its original ideals. In today's 
commemorative pull-out section, the Guardian takes a look at the 
history of Marshall College and the legacy of the former Supreme 
Court justice. 

Starkey cited the budget crisis as a poten-
tial culprit in last year' large graduati ng 
class. " I suspect that the increase in fees has 
been a cause fo r people trying to hurry and 
fini sh up [their studies)," 

Both Hickok ancl Starkey were able to 
account for at least 200 of the 371 fewer 
students by explai ning that the campus had 
planned on a 200-student dec rease in enroll-
ment this fall. 

According to Starkey, " We actua lly 
planned a year ago to [drop I 200 students. 

Kripke Praised as Invaluable Asset to UCSD 
Byu .. Lemer 
Guardian Reporter 

Dr. Z Kripke, an invaluable 
physician with the Student Health 
Center, will retire at the end of 
this month under the UC system's 
VERIPearly retirement program. 

Kripke, who has worked in the 
Student Health Center since 1972, 
is known not only for her ability to 
deal with students' physical and 
psychological problems, but also 
for her involvement in the UCSD 
community. 

During her tenure at UCSD, 
Kripke taught at both the UCSD 
Medical School and Crafts Cen-
ter, served as a commencement 
speaker and was involved with the 

, MuirCollege Orientation program 
as well as many community and 

church groups. 
Kripke was praised by her col-

leagues as an integral part of what 
Student Health is all about. "She 
envisioned the women's clinic at 
Student Health and made it a real-
ity 10 years ago," said Nurse Gina 
Powell-Clayton, who has served 
at Student Health for the same 
amount of time as Kripke. 

Aside from her role in found-
ing the women's clinic, Kfipke 
demonstrated a remarkable abi 1 i ty 
in counseling students with psy-
chological and emotional prob-
lems, particularly those suffering 
from chronic health problems. 
According to Student Health Di-
rector John Giebink, Kripke's en-
thusiasm, vigor and availability to 
students will be missed by every-

one at Student Health. 
"She did more for morale than 

anybody in the face of adversity 
and tight money [at Student 
Health]," said Associate Physician 
Alanna Bodenstab, who added that 
she was devastated when she 
learned of Kripke 's retirement. 
"[Kripkel has the most loyal fol -
lowing of patients," said Bodenstab. 

"She was a role model," said 
Assoc!ate Physician Robert 
Weston, who added that Kripke 
played an influential part in bring-
ing him to UCSD in 1981 . Weston 
also praised Kripke for her politi-
cal involvement, noting that she is 
president of Physicians for Social 
Responsibility. 

Besides her responsibilities at 
the health center, Kripke is an

DROP: Higher 
fees could be the 
reason for decrease 
ContInued from pace 1 
Because of the budget, we said, 
'you know it doesn't make sense 
to keep Inking students [when the 
budget keeps getting worse] ... , 

Following the announcement 
last week that fees may be raised 
again this year, Starkey said he 
was con~rned over the recent in-
creases in fees. "Personally ,I hate 
to see fees go up," Starkey said. 

"I think in generallhe adminis-
tration would hate to see fees go 
up," he added. 

Starkey explained that "one 
of the beauties of the California 

Master Plan [for higher educa-
tion] is accessibility." The rise 
in fees is making the university 
less accessible to qualified stu-
dents, he said. 

Starkey indicated his frustra-
tion with the fixed budget system 
and blamed it for some of the 
university's recent budget woes. 
"Eighty-six percent of the budget 
is fixed, through mllndlltes .... The 
remaining 14 percent gets 100 
percent of the cuts." 

Starkey added that by imple-
menting shon-term solutions, the 
university has "passed on what 
could be a long-term disaster." 

While the future ofsludenl en-
rollment may not look as bleak as 
expected, the financial future of 
the university remains in ques-

tion. 
Higher education is closely 

linked to the State of California 
and its budget, Starkey said, and 
the state's slow economic recov-
ery could be indicative of a slow 
recovery for higher education in 
California. 

". suspect it' ll be several years 
before we see significant improve-
ment. It's definitely a difficult 
problem," Starkey said. 

A meeting to be held today will 
determine next year's enrollment 
policy. Starkey did not predict any 
major changes in enrollment for 
next fall. 

"We'll probably shoot for the 
same enrollment ne1lt year [as this 
year]," he said. "Every year we're 
going to be off 100 or so."

Time for tllG People of Los 
Angeles to Move on 

Despite the fact that the verdicts announced in the Reginald 
Denny trial fail to deliver justice to Denny to the city of Los Angeles. 
the citizens of Los Angeles want to move beyond the Rodney King 
and Reginald Denny episodes. 

If there had been no clear evidence to identify defendants Henry 
Wmsoll and Danlian Williams as the people involved in Denny's 
bemll1g. then they should have been acquitted of all crime commit-
t d at that pruticular ·cene. However, if the evidence proves to be as 
onv ll1cing (0 the jurors as it has been to the public, then the 

detendants should be convicted of all charges - including at-
tempted murder. 

By only convicting Watson of mi demeanor assault and Will-
iams wirh a lesser felony charge of mayhem. the jury is letting both 
of them off the hook. There is no question that the men beating up 
on Denny were intent on murdering him - a brick to the head 
suggests more than a misdemeanor assault. There is no middle 
ground in such a case. 

However. trial verdicts aside. the people of Los Angeles want to 
work toward their city's future and leave the Rodney King and 
Reginald Denny beatings as hard-learned lessons. It's time to see a 
conclusion to this long ordeal of racial tensions. Surprisingly, 
Reginald Denny was among those who felt that this tumultuous 
period should come to an end. Continuing to reflect the infallible 
dignity he has displayed throughout his tribulations, Denny ex-
pressed his satisfaction with the verdict saying, "I was relieved ... I 
am in total agreement [with the jurors]." Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan voiced similar sentiments as well, telling the city 
that, "now is the time to look forward, not back, to look at what we 
can do for the future of our city." The Rodney King and Reginald 
Denny beatings have monopolized Los Angeles' time and image for 
far too long. and the city now needs to move forward, having learned 
imponant lessons from both tragedies. 

The Same Old Story 
Last week's historic joint meeting of the University of California 

Board of Regents and California State University Trustees couldn 'I 
have come at a bener time for both universities. Public higher 
educalion has taken a beating since 1991, always seeming to come 
up short in the govemor's annual budget sweepstakes. 

UC President Emeritus Clark Kerr summed up the situation 
facing public higher education best: Because of the state ' s economic 
slump, he said, "Higher education is not fighting for its survival, it's 
fighting for its soul." Budget cuts have become the norm, not the 
exception. University officials have resigned themselves to the fact 
that they are fated to receive a smaller portion of the budget pie in 
upcoming years. 

That was the focus of last week 's joint UC-CSU meeting in 
Sacramento - planning for a future in which state funding will be 
less available. One of UC President Jack Peltason' s pet projects has 
been to find new ways of dealing with the ongoing budget crisis, and 
this meeting certainly was a step in that direction. 

But while good intentions and sound ideas were being lobbied 
back and forth in Sacramento, UC officials were proposing the same 
old solutions to the budget problem. An Office of the President 
budgel report indicated that student fees may be raised by as much 
as $650 next year to fund the shortfall between the UC's operating 
budget and what Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed for 1994-95. The 
report also speculates that fees could be raised by $600 for the next 
severdl years. 

To put it succinctly, these fee hikes have become intolerable. HI 
think we've reached the zenith of students' ability to pay. Period," 
said Speaker of the Assembly Willie Brown at last week's meeting. 
Brown is absolutely correct - fees are already over $4,000 a year, 
twice the amount they were jusl four years ago. By constantly trying 
to balance the budget on the backs of students, the university is 
shutting the door on qualified students who may be unable to pay the 
skyrocketing fees. 

Fee hikes are, by Peltason's own admission, a short-term solu-
tion. The university is shortsighted enough as it is - what the UC 
system /I('eds is a long-term vision to see it through the bad times. If 
the president and the regents are serious about looking for new 
solutions to the budget crisis, they would do well to look beyond 
stopgap measures such as fee hikes.

A PEACE OF IE E: ACTIoN? 

ANDREW 

HEYftOLD5 
WORLD 
VIEW 

The Nobel Peace 
Prize has visited South 
Africa for the third 
time since 1960. this 
time acknowledging 
the historic and 
dramatic Ihrust 
toward democracy 
that most observers 
hope will lead to a 
non-racial parliament 
next year. 

In recognition of 
their roles in the 
ongoing 'democrdtic 
revolution.' Dr. 
Nelson Mandela and 

South African President Frederik de Klerk have 
been jointly awarded the Peace Prize, and ( am 
sure that many will feel the recognition is well-
earned. However. the overwhelming problem 
with this award is that only one of the recipients 
truly deserves il. 

Nelson Mandela embodies all that a Nobel 
Peace Prize winner should be. He has worked 
tirelessly and suffered terribly for his simple 
belief in the dignity and value of all South 
Africans, regardless of color or creed. His lead-
ership, both from jail and as president of the 
African National Congress (ANC), created the 
necessary environment for fruitful peace 
negotiations between repn:sentatives of the black 
majority and the white minority government. 
He has shown statesmanship and decency, but 
above all he has shown that emotion is crucial to 
the creation of peace and reconciliation. He 
never spoke with bitterness about his ']J years

of incarceration and has al-
ways tried to Understand the 
motivation of past sins visited 
upon his people. This ability 
to fC;'give has been passed on 
to new generations of black 
South African political lead-
ership and has thus made the 
peace process far more viable 
than ever before. 

On a practical level, this 
has manifested itself in recent meetings be-
tween Mandela and the white right-wing 
Afrikaaner Volks Front regarding its demand 
for an ethnic slate. This has also led to Mandela 's 
continuing effons to heal the wounds with his 
old ally, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. These 
wounds have led to the deaths of thousands in 
inter-factional fighting. Like Luthuli (winner of 
the Peace Prize in 1960) and Bishop 
DesmondTutu (winner in 1984), Mandela is a 
man of great decency and humanity who offers 
the best hope for stability in South Africa. 

President F.W. de Klerlt now stands on the 
same stage as these previous Nobel Peace Prize 
winners and should be judged according to that 
same high standard. The award was not just 
presented in recognition of the strides de Klerk 
and Mandela made in the negotiation process, 
but also in recognition of the men themselves. 
Sadly, de Klerk' s actions demonstrate that he is 
woefully lacking. 

De Klett continued the refonn process at a 
time when political and economic factors left 
him with no other choice. After years of repre-
senting and designing the apartheid state, he 
simply realized at the end of the '80s that to 

continue to entrench white 
power and tum away from the 
increasingly organized black 
majority in South Africa would 
only lead to economic disinte-
gration and political collapse. 
There was no "conversion on 
the road to Damascus" for de 
Klerk. 

His only rational course 
was to continue the 

accomodation begun by his predecessor. arch 
right-winger P.W. Botha. and try to appease 
black Soulh African anger by incorporating 
them into the political process. De Klerk has 
never advocated majority democr.lcy, and even 
today he and his National Party are still trying to 
devise checks, vetoes and constilutional ma-
neuvers to protect white economic and political 
interests long after a democratic govemment 
would take office. 

De Klerlt's personal political history not 
only characterizes him as a representative of 
apanheid. but also as a designer of apanheid 
law. He was actively involved as a fOOl soldier 
in National Pany politics from 1961 to 1973, 
and then as a government Member of Parlia-
ment, passing some of apanheid's worst dis-
criminatory legislation. In 1978, he was ap-
pointed to the cabinet and has remained there 
ever since, holding a number of ministerial 
positions (including Home Affairs). which gave 
him the power to suppress democracy and per-
petrate countless civil rights abuses. 

Even as president. he has presided over a 
government that has ·channeled huge amounts 
of public moneys to (nkatha in an anempt to

If the Nobel Peace Prize Committee ' ~ wish 
wj1S to provide an "ethnic balance " to thi~ award 
and highlight the role of both white~ and blacks 
in crafting the new South Africa. there is a 
plethora of far worthier cand idates than F.W. de 
Klerk. Helen Suzman hus been 3n unstinting 
defender of democracy and civ il rights for the 
last 40 years in South Africa. Throughout the 
'60s. she represented the only oppo'o ition to 
apal1heid in parliament. and she cOlllinlies to be 
a voice of reason andjll~ti ce loday. Albie Sachs 
has inspired a whole genelUti on of South Afri-
can with his quiet coumge. decency and com-
mitment to inalienable hum'ln rights for all of 
his compatriots in South Africa. Joe Siovo has 
performed invaluable service in crafting the 
compromises that have moved the negotiation 
process forward in South Africa. The South 
African government ha branded such heroes as 
the worst types of narional traitors. This we 
cannot forget. 

The Nobel Peace Prize should be a glorious 
celebration of unique contributions 10 
humankind. Its essence becomes tainted and ils 
credibility 10 t when it is awarded toone unwor-
thy of such distincti on. In years to come. I 
predict that the world will remember Nelson 
Mandela's award wi th far more affection than 
could ever be mustered lip forPre,idt:nt F. W. de

Suspicions of sexual 
harrassment 
ContInued from PII&e 4 
conscientious objector. With all the 
recent hullabaloo about sexual 
harassment and acquaintance rape. 
on campus, I have concluded that it 
is as dangerous to be a man as it is to 
be a woman. I throw up my hands 
and commit myself to a life of 
ascetism and metaphysical 
contemplation. Theneo-puritlln and 
do-gooders have won the day. 

The current issue of Newsweek 
only confilms my tragic suspicions. 
Ln these overly-sensitive, post-Hill 
days .. anything can be construed as 
sexual harassment. 

Unwanted sexual advances, be 
they innocent or not-it prolonged 
stare, a poorly-worded proposition, 
a nude portrait or a wolf-whist le-
are fast approaching capital offenses 
in this counrry, punishable by lost 
reputation, lost livelihood or lost 
freedom . 

What ' more. any lamented 
sexual I iaison may now beconsidered 
rape. Antioch College has gone so 
faras to drnft a code of sexual conduct 
requiring mutual consent for every 
level of sexual intercourse. 

A simple proposition answered 
with an affirmative is not enough. 
Every kiss. grope. nuzzle and 
embrace requiresexpl icit pelmission 
under penalty of disciplinary action. 
And if the woman has had . a much 
as a sniff of alcohol. the whole 
contract is null lind void. 

Only in America would anyone 
seriouslyconsiderpoisoningsex with 
legalisms. Modem feminism is legal 
absolutism gone mad. To assel1 that 
viewing Goya's ''The Naked Maja" 
is the moral equivalent of the sexual 
advances of a brutish employer is 
laughable. But 10 compare a 
regrettable night of clumsy. drunken 
sex loa violent assault at knife-point 
is not only absurd, it's obscene. 

Men have done little - except 
play a convenient enemy - to 
contribute to the predicament in 
which the women' s movement now 
finds itself. Feminists have createo 
an atmosphere of fear and loathing 
around themselves. 

When every "'''11 is a potential 
rapist, and every woman a potential 
victim, there is no reason to believe 
that the equality women so 
desperately seek is remotely 
possi ble. The patriarchy is 
insurmount ab le by their own 
admission . Empowelment is a joke. 
The strong woman is a 98-pound 
weakling. 

The feminists will denounce this 
as yet another sexist attack. another 
strike again t womyn ill thl! ongoing 
backlash. TIley may call it whatever 
they choose because Ina longer give 
a di1mn. [ wash my hand~ of the 
whole sordid business and commend 
both sides to redouble thei r effons, 
Perhaps then the problem children

Documenting America 
Exhibit shows 
hardships of 
Depression 

By Care Udell 
Staff Writer 

Although it often seems Americans 
want to forget periods of strife, the photos 
currently on display at the Mandeville 
Gallery show that the '305 and '40s are a 
part of American history worth remem-
bering, despite the hardships suffered. 

mentAmericadu ring the 1930s and ' 40s. 
The photographic series chosen for 

th is exhibition portrays the nation's re-
action to the Grea,t Depression and the 
Second World War. Each photographer's 
foc us differs from community to com-
munity and state to tate, j ust as the 
backdrop itself varies. Some depict im-
ages of rural and small-town America. 
while others scrutin ize li fe withi n an 
urban environment. This topographical 
variety offers a diverse overview of the 
country, and the honesty and potency of 
each image evokes a con~is tent syn~p;\­
thy. 

"Documenting America, 1935- 1943," 
the opening exhibit of the 1993-94 season 
at the UCSD Mandeville Gallery, is a 
compilation of black-and-white photo-
graphs taken by a group of American 
photographers. These indi viduals, com-

HIATUS 10 The UCSD Guardian 

THEATER 

By John Godfrey 
Guardian Reporter 

S
an Diego's emergence as a na-
tionally-recognized theater 
center is closely connected to 

the development of the UCSD-
based La lolla Playhouse. Both 
the Old Globe Theatre and the San 
Diego Repertory have been around 
longer than the Playhouse. but 
neither institution draws much at-
tention outside of the county. Al-
though the Globe has 25.000 sub-
scribers. it rarely takes artistic 
chances. and even though the San 
Diego Repertory experiments on 
stage, it often lacks the fi cal and! 
or intellectual means to produce 
high-quality results. 

Sweet and Hot 
La Jolla Playlwuse production relies on 

schmaltz in tribute to Harold Arlen 

For the past II years. the La 
Jolla Playhouse has tried to strike 
a balance between business and 
art, producing work that both en-
tertains and challenges audiences. 
Sometimes the Playhouse brings 
exciting, creative work to its stages 
("The Mis ion ..... The Hairy Ape") 
and ometime it offers dreadful. 
mindless pap. 

Lisl "Sweet and Hot: The Songs 
of Harold Arlen" under the mind-
less pap category. 

The musical revue is a tribute 
to the late Harold Arlen, composer 
of songs ~uch as "Get Happy." 
"Stormy Weather." "That Old 
Black Magic" and the score from 
rhe Wiuzrd 01 Oz. Clearly, Arlen 
is a talent worth saluting. This 
production. however. is a slick, 
schmaltzy collection of musical 
numbers that doesn't do justice to 
his catalog. 

B .... n Quinn and T...." B ....... perform Mf'ancy Free" In 1weet and Hot." 

"Sweet and Hot" comes to La 
Jolla via Sarasota, Florida, where 
director and creator luI ianne Boyd 
first mounted the revue in associa-
tion with the New Jersey-based 

McCarter Theatre. In an effort to 
cut costs this season, the Play-
house importedhalfofits season's 
shows from other theater groups, 
with its production of Culture

Alice" and "A .. . My Name is Still 
Alice," the second of which pre-
miered at the Old Globe Theatre. 
The "Alice" series, tluffy as it 
was, confronted the audience on 
levels which went beyond "Sweet 
and Hot." The all-woman revue 
dealt with the variou form of 
repression American women have 
been subjected to throughout the 
20th century, and poradically 
asked the audience to question its 
behavior patterns. There wasn' t 
much substance to the piece. but al 
least there was some. 

"Sweet and Hot" is almost noth-
ing. There is a pretty art deco set 
and a competent four-piece bund, 
but virtually nothing else. This is 
quite simply a collection of song 
and dance routines. 

To hercredit. Boyd does not try 
to force some linear narrative Gut 
of Arlen 's eclectic compositions, 
She does, however, try to create a 
distinct context and an irritating 
little mini-story for vi rtually ev-
ery musical number in the show. 

For instance, while singing 
"Between the Devil and the Deep 

• Blue Sea." performers Allen 
Hidalgo, Terry Burrell and Monica 
Pege act out every line with ex-
planatory gestures and fac ial con-
tonions. Rather than focus on the 
emotional quality of the song and 
letting the words tell the tory, 
these three spell out every mood 
with ridiculous mugging and cI ich~ 
movements. Tn the process, the 
soul of the song is supplanted by 
these cornball acti vities.

It sounds like an Anglo-Saxon 
expression for art to me. I'm a 
Greek, so I come from a much 
older tradition of performance. 
Do you model your vocals 
after anyone or anything? 

No I really don't. It's not even 
something that I can talk about 
accurately because the sound takes 
me to another place, so I keep 
pushing that. When it comes to 
doing a song, let's say a song by 
Willie Dixon, then each of those 
songs is like an epic or drama and 
I try to get to the;. bottom of the 
song or I try to jump in it like it's 
a pool of water. Where the drama 
of the piece goes, that's where the 
voice goes.

I did. I actually went. I was 
accepted at Revelle a while ago in 
science. So that's what I was go-
ing to do, And then for many rea-
sons I ended up back in music. I 
started out in music as a little girl, 
so I ended up in music again. But 
I studied a lot of stuff there. I 
studied behavioral psychology and 

biochemistry. I was able to study a 
lot of different things at the same 
time , The combination ofall those 
things - plus it being the . 70s -
kind of put me into what I' m doing 
now,

Yeah, from different places. I

that was a big problem. But, also 
the Christian Broadcast Network

They did. With me and some 
other musicians that they were rep-

ernment Is doing anything 
worthwhile about AIDS? 

We 're going to find OUt, I think 
now with a new government, 
there's certainly a lot of promises 
being made, but we have to find 
out. 

The people who are AIDS ac-
tivists know that the only to make 
sure that something happens, is to 
continue a level of activism, or 
even stronger, because as soon as 
it seems like you're sleeping, ev-
eryone else does too,

best lean on stage, andjust leave it

FILM 

Judgment Night 
Four friends find themselves 

in an urban nightmare 

With The Fllgitive and Ju ras-
s ic Park as the summer's only 
stand-outs, finding a good film 
th is season was like try ing to hit a 
Hard Target. Movie accidents 
like Last Action Hero and Week-
end at Bemie 's II lowered my ex-
pectationsofHollywood, but when 
Boxing Helena hi t the theaters, I 
was sure that all arti stic standards 
had been nushed down the toilet. 

Enter Jlldgment Nigh! - an 
action movie more publicized for 
its soundtrack than its storyline. 
With a cast of talented, yet small -
name actors, and a director known 
mostly for his work on second-
rate sequels, Stephen Hopkins ' 
Judgment Night is refreshingly 
smart, intense and electrifying. 

As the plot develops , four 
friends on their way to a boxing 
match make a wrong turn off the 
expressway into a neighborhood 
that is just around the corner, yet a 
world away from anything they 
had ever imagined. Here there are 
no rules, no order and no mercy. 

By Jenny Galang 
Senior Staff Writer 

After witnessing a murder in cold 
blood, the men must run and then 
fight for their li ves . 

Emilio Estevez plays Frank 
Wyatt. the unofficial leader of the 
group who represents an 
"everyman," someone everyone 
can relate to. The group of friends 
also includes Cuba Gooding, l r. 
(Boyz N The Hood ), Stephen Dorff 
(The Power of Olle) and Jeremy 
Piven (Singles). Acerbic stand-up 
comedian Denis Leary plays the 
arch-villain . 

Shot in nighttime Los Angeles 
and Chicago, Judgment Night 
opens our eyes to a different world 
that remains slightly unfamiliar 
and unpredictable throughout the 
entire film. We're taken through 
housing projects, deserted streets 
and railroad graveyards. 

The film presents us with the 
reality that, in a time of crisis, 
people are sometimes so scared 
that they are not only unable to 
help others, they are unable to 
help themselves. 

As its ti tle suggest. . this mov ie 
is about be ing tested. It questions 
just how strong, fea rl ess and moral 
we thi nk we are and how we would 
respond ina life or death" i wation. 

What separatesJllriglllC'lI! Nigh! 
from otherfilm ~ in its genre is that 
although the si tuations ,he charoc-
ters are placed in may b'e difficult 
to envision, the reac tions are real 
and believable. 

Wecan feel Wyatt 's panic . fear 
and relief as well as the villain 's 
warped sense of vengeance. De-
spite the fact that Hopki ns feeds us 
the Hollywood ending, we ' re re-
lieved to fi nd that the good guys 
prevail and that the world turned 
ups ide-down is fi nall y righted.

HOT: Emotions 
of songs are ignored 
ContInued from ..... 10 

Arlen's music is better served 
by a talented singer who is unen-
cumbered by a "clever" stage di-
rector. In her rendition of "Stormy 
Weather," Monica Pege simply 
took the stage and belted out the 
ballad at the top of her lungs. Pege 
moved around the stage, but she 
was not carrying an umbrella or 
consulting her barometer as she 
sang the popular tune. Sadly, this 
was the exception to the rule. 

"Sweet and Hot" might have 
been saved if Boyd had cast actors 
who demand an audience' s atten-
tion, but this ensemble is quite 
dull . Each possesses a passable 
singing voice and the requisite 
dancing skills, but of the five per-
formers, only one (Allen Hidalgo) 
demonstrates the kind of energy 
that musical revues always need.

ART: Individual 
views emphasized 
ContInued from pace 8 
sonalized, revealing a certain de-
gree of artistic freedom. 

Each of the 12 photographers, 
some of whom were venturing out 
on their first professional assign-
ment, present us with a unique 
personal vision. Arriving at their 
destined location, they took the 
framework of social concern and 
mixed with it their own responses 
to the circumstances they encoun-
tered. ln this way, each photogra-
pher successfully documents the 
country . 

While the particular subject 
matter varies for each photogra-
pher, the parJicular mood of the 
era is reflected in the images of 
each face. John Collier Jr. went to 
Trampas, New Mexico, and took 
a series of photos which depict a 
family within the shelter of its

home. The stark shades of black 
and white, along with the ex-
tremely candid and placid expres-
sions of the family members, re-
veal a genuine picture of their way 
of life. Collier's style lets the fam-
ily members, their home and all 
that surrounds them do the com-
municating. 

Ben Shahn and Gordon Parks 
highlight the individual , but they 
expand on this theme by docu-
menting the same people in varied 
settings to offer a more complete 
story. Shahn photographed life 
amidst cotton plantations for a few 
months in Arkansas . He concen-
trated on the individual as worker, 
family member and churchgoer 
- all represent ing integral roles 
one occupies wi thin the commu-
nity. 

Theircombined expressions of 
exhaustion, conte mplation and 
overriding indifference say much 
about theirpredicamenl. Parks also

who suffer under such conditions. 

The consistent image on this 
woman's face. like Shahn 's cot-

THE HELEN EDISON LECTURE SERIES 
presents a FREE public lecture 

Nobel Laureate 
Derek Walcott 

poet, essayist, 
painter & playwright 

Thursday, October 21 
7pm 

Mandeville Auditorium 

Born in St. Lucia, Walcott's writing is greatly 
influenced by his experience growing up on an isolated 
island in the multicultural Caribbean. His works often 
reflect his struggle to reconcile the region's colonial 
past and his own background of African, Dutch and 
English ancestry. Among Walcott's achievements are 
the epic poem Omeros, nine books of poetry, including 
the autobiographical Another Life, and twelve plays. 
Most recently, he has collaborated with Paul Simon on 
a new play. Thursday evening, he will read and reflect 
on selections from his work. 

Please plan to arrive early. Seating is limited for this frflfl event. 
For more information call 534-3440.

PEHLKHn 
Ducks Quack 
NHLIce 

There are a few things in 
sports I guess I'll never 
Understand. Like why are left-
handed pitchers always called 
"crafty" and what the hell is a 
Canuck? 

Perhaps the greatest of all 
sports anomalies has to be the 
Anaheim Mighty Ducks -
excuse me - The Mighty 
Ducks of Anaheim. 

One of 1993's newest 
hockey clubs, the Ducks are a 
creation of the Disney Corpora-
tion and a spin-off of the movie 
by the same name. 

Anaheim burst onto the 
hockey scene this year and is 
already taking the league by 
stann. Sales from Ducks' 
merchandise in the team's first 
home game averaged over $17 
per person. But then. what do 
you expect from Disney, the 
people who charge $39.95 for a 
pair of mouse ears with your 
name engraved on them? 

The UCSD GWlrdian SPORTS 15 

I remember the first time I 
heard that Anaheim's new 
hockey team would be named 
after water fowl. I think the 
expression on my face re-
sembled the look that Beavis 
and Butt-head get when they're 
watching a Nelson video. It 
was just something I couldn't 
believe was happening, like 
some operation gone terribly 
wrong, or Beverly Hills 90210:

The College Years . 

Much to my chagrin. 'The 
Happiest Team on Earth" did kick 
off its first season two weeks ago. 
Rumor has it that the home 
opener was the biggest thing to 
happen to skating since Snoopy on 
Ice IRimt 16 mdll6lhe IMl1II!IC 
Michael Jordon poker hInI. 

A buddy of mine and I have 
a theory on this flying feathery 
Disney friend. Bets are that the 
soaring Donald is actually 
former King great Ron Dugay. 
It's common knowledge that 
Dugay was actually Sandy Gull 
of San Diego Gulls' fame last 
year. The kid finally made it to 
the big leagues. 

Now, I swore to myself that I 
would not watch the Ducks. I 
refused-it was a matter of prin-
ciple, a Clint Eastwood kind of 
thing. 

But, alas, I could not keep 
myself from tuning in to a Ducks 
game last week. 

Anaheim was ahead of 
Edmonton 5-4 with time running 
out. I don't know who these guys

With 12 games down and four to go, the UCSD 
women's soccer team has gotten down to busi-
ness. The Tritons are experiencing something of a 

mid-season renaissance 
and are playing their best 
soccer as the year draws to 
a close. 

After a big win against 
Azusa Pacific last week, 
UCSD traveled to Pomona 
Pitzer on Monday for an 
even bigger game. 

The Tritons shrugged 
ofl any pressure they may 
have felt and walked away 
with a 3-0 victory over the 
Sagehens, to extend their 

record to a nearly flawless J 1-0-1 . 
UCSD Head Coach Brian McManus has been 

doing his best impression of Notre Dame football 
coach Lou Holtz all season. Like Holtz, he fo-
cuses on the other team's potential, while 
downplaying his own team's inevitable success, 
But his team has always come through, and 
Monday's game was no exception. 

Pomona is a quality Division III leam, but 
UCSDcompletely shutdown the Sagehensoffen-
sively and attacked the bewildered Pomona-
Pitzer defense until it was reeling like Don Knotts 
after insulting Riddick Bowe. 

The Tritons broke through II minutes into the 

game, striking on one of their favorite offensive 
opportunities - the corner kick. 

Michelle Carbone rifled a kick from the right 
corner, which was batted away by Sagehen goal-
keeper Suari Morrison, The ball found its way to 
UCSD's Amanda Johnson, who quickly passed it 
back to Carbone. Carbone sailed acrossing pass 10 
the back post where teammate Ele Johnson leaped 
and nailed a perfectly-timed header into the net to 
put the Tritons up, 1-0. 

The next UCSD score came only two minutes

later. Once again, a Carbone comer kick ended up 
with Amanda Johnson, this time at the top of the 
penalty box. The sophomore touched it once, 
bouncing it up, and then booted it past Morrison 
from 20 yards out. 

The Tritons had to wait a bit for their final 
score. With only three minutes to play in the game, 
sophomore forward Carin Pugh took the ball 
down the right side all the way to the goa l line, She 
centered to senior forward Daphne Farnulll, who 
got her head on the ball, and the ~core was 3-0, 

According to McManus, although Morrison 
was beaten three times, if it wasn't for h~r. "the 
score would have been 8-0 or 9-0. She WLIS an 
incredible athlete, very quick and agile." 

But Ihe Tritons did get past Morrison, twice in 
the first 30 minute of the game, which McManu 
called "the be t soccer we've played in quite a 
while." 

The second half saw the Sagehens pick up the 
intensity, forcing UCSD to play "scrappy. We 
forgot our passing game for a while, but we were 
never in danger," McManus sa id. 

The Tritons lined up to take their turn at 
Morrison, launching 24 shots at the keeper, 

While the San Diego offen e unloaded, the 
typically stingy Triton defen edenied uny Sagehen 
attempts to climb back into the game. allowing 
only two shots throughout the entire conte~t. 

"Pomona· Pitzer was an athl etic team," 
McManus said, "but our whole squad had a lot of 
opportunities and our intensity the first 30 minutes 
was the best of the season,"

Tritons Play Spotty, 
Still Lynch Leopards 
VOWYBALL: Despite relapses of uninspired play, 
UCSD still manages to win third straight match, 3-1 
By Aron Miller 
Associate Sports Editor 

Things seem to be panning out 
just like UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik had planned for the Tri-

ton women's 
volleyba ll 
team. 

San Diego 
won its third 
straight con-
test on Tues-
day night. de-
feating the 
Leopards of 
the Uni versilY 
of La Verne in 
four sets. 15-
II, 14-16, 17-

IS. 15-2. upping its record to 13-9. 

all year against Division ill competi-
lion, amassing a record of 13-2. 

In game one, UCSD outkilled La 
Verne, IS-II, and went on to win 
the set by the same 15- II score. 

In game two, the Tritons re-
lapsed into a troubling pattern that 
plagued them earlier in the year. 

The Scoreboard 

UCSD 15 14 17 15 

LA VERNE 11 lG 15 2 

They came out apathetic, and the 
Leopards pounced on the opportu-
nity. Erratic hitting and a match-
high 14 errors cost UCSD. and an 
energetic La Verne squad seized the 
econd set, 16-14. 

The UCSD Guardjan Thursday , Octobcl' 21, 1993 

COLUMN: 
Mighty Duck tales 
Continued from paJ. 15 
are, butthe Ducks' announcers were 
going crazy. Anaheim won and, 

mu~h to my dismay, 1 enjoyed it. 
Maybe the Ducks do have some-

thing to offer. Their logo looks like 
a horrible mutation from a Friday 
the J 3th movie. butthey' ve got some 
pretty cool things going for them. 

Between periods, the Duck fea-
ture what is called "Dueling 
Zambonies." Apparently, Anaheim 
has two machines that compete to 
see which can do the job tirst. 

Imagine two z:lmbonie drivers 
competing for the last piece of ice. 
As both turn the comer and head for 
home, one zambonie bumps the 
other, which goes careening into the 
boards and bursts into flames. The 
crowd roars forthe victolious driver, 
while the other limps away, cursing 
and threatening revenge. That's what 
hockey is all about. 

The Canadians are supposedly 
insulted by the name "Migh ty 
Ducks." They think Americans are 
mocking them and their national 
spon. 

During the first month of the 
season. Dannevik, unconcerned 
aboul wins and losses, had his team 
playing laugh Division I and II op-
ponents left and right. 

Now it looks as though the initial 
deposit is paying dividends. Corn-
ing off a 3- 1 performance over the 
weekend at the Mizuno Invitational, 
UCSD appears to be gaining mo-
mentum for the last month of the 
season, which includes Western 
Regionals and Nationals. 

"If we don't have our heart in it, 
we can look pretty ugly," Dannevik 
admitted. 

Again the Tritons left the huddle 
lackadaisically for game three. Af-
ter falling behind early, they were 
forced into a late comeback and 
barely managed to win the set, 17-
IS, taking a 2-1 advantage. 

Jason Rltcn,eIGuara,an 
Senior outside hitter Laura Kranz, benched earlier thl ..... on, I. 
redlscoverlnc her kill touch, 51amml", home 22 In Triton victory. 

The NBA has granted permis-
sion for a new Toronto franchise, 
and those from the Great White 
North may plot their revenge. Don't 
be surprised to see the Lakers or 
Bulls matching up against the Slam 
Dunkers or some equally horrible 
abomination of a name in Yl!ar to 
come. 

Although the Tritonsseemed un-
inspired while playing the lacklus-
ter Leopards, they got the job done. 
They have performed consistently 

Learning its lesson from games 
two and three, UCSD absolutely 
pummeled La Verne in the fourth 
set, racing out to an overwhelming 
11 -0 lead and cruising to a 15-2 
victory for the match. 3-1. 

"La Verne was inspired and we 
weren't," Dannevik said. "We were 
glad to just get in and get out [with 
a win]." 

Senior outside hitter Laura 
Kranz, who has been hot and cold 
all year long, led the team with 22 
kills, but simultaneously collected a 
team-high nine errors. Guardian 

Athlete-of-the-Week Elizabeth 
Vesanovic spiked 18 kills for San 
Diego, while sophomore setter Amy 
Crotty led the team with 50 assists 
and 17 digs. 

UCSD will continue its road trip 
this weekend, traveling to Texas to 
participate in the Trinity University 
Invitational. 

What more do the Canadians 
want from us anyway') They've al-
ready got our World Series Trophy. 
If they're not careful, we may just 
tum their flag upside down again.

Wash U Alumnus Marks Misnomer 
Dear Editor: 

As an alumnus of Washington 
University in St. Louis, now do-
ing graduate work at UCSD, I feel 
it is my duty to correct yourgriev-
ous misappelation of my alma 
mater. 

In your article reporting the 
results of the recent Washington 
U ni versi ty- UCSD volleyball 
match (Oct. 18), you mistakenly 
called the home of the victorious 
Bears "the University of Wash-
ington," which marked an im-
provement over what you had 
called it in the preview article 
(Oct. 14), "the University of 
Washington of St. Louis." 

Washington University is not 
an abbreviation of the University 
of Washington. any more than 
Harvard University is an abbrevi-
ated "University of Harvard." If 
Harvard were to be the university 
of something, it would be either 
the University of Massachusetts 
or the University of Cambridge: 
however. both names have already 
been taken. The University of 
Cambridge (in England) is also 
known as Cambridge University. 

This is a common device in the 
United Kingdom: uni versities 
named for their location (for ex-
ample, Sussex) can properly be 
called either the university of that 
loction or that location's univer-
sity. Hence, the University of Sus-
sex is the same institution as Sus-

sex University, and that univer-
sity is frequently called both 
names. 

We do not share this conven-
tion in the United States. The Uni-
versity of San Diego is never 
called San Diego University. In 
fact, if a new uni versity wanted to 
call itself San Diego University, 
it could do so without fearing 
confusion (or lawsuits) with USD. 
(However, they might have some 
troubles with San Diego State 
University). 

Of course, none of this applies 

to the naming of Washington Uni-
versity because it is not a univer-
sity named for its location. It is in 
neither the city nor the state of 
Washington. nor even in Wash-
ington County (it is set, miracu-
lously enough, in SI. Louis 
County), and so it can in no way 
be construed as a university of 
Washington. And as far as the 
"Washington of St. Louis" goes, 
George Washington (for whom 
the university was named) was 
not of SI. Louis any more than SI. 
Louis is of Washington. Wash-
ington was from Virginia. 

The full and official name of 
what we're talking about is 
"Washington University in Saint 
Louis," which, I think, is a re-
markable courtesy to those many 
who are confused abou t the 
school, its name and its location. 

"Washington University" is a 
perfectly acceptable abbrevia-
tion, as is "Wash U" in a collo-
quial setting. Please make a note 
of it, as the Battling Bears will 
most likely be thrashing the Tri-
tons at volleyball for many years 
to come. 

Adam Goodie 

Editor's Note: The Guardian re-
grets the error. Regarding the 
thrashing, you'ff have to refer (0

The 
Stage 
is Set 
UCSO's Marshall 
College makes its 

official debut 
tomorrow 

A dministrators, sNdenu, faculty and staff will take pan in a ceremony to dedicate Thurgood Marshall College on Friday. The 
college, which had been referred to as Third 
College since its founding 23 years ago, 
officially chanp its name this year to honor 
Thurgood Marshall, the former Supreme Coun 
justice and civil righu leader, 

The one-hour ceremony will begin at 3 p_m. 
in the quad by Sol(s Hall and will feature a 
keynote address by Marian Wright Edelman, 
president and founder of the National 
Children's Defense Fund. University of 
California President Jack Peltason, UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson and Marshall 
College Provost Cecil Lytle are also scheduled 
to speak at the event. 

UCSD Professor Carlos Blanco, who was 
one of the founding faculty members at Third 
College, will receive a lifetime achievement 
award at the ceremony. Faculty, student and 
alumni speakers will appear as well. 

"[The ideals of the] life of Thurgood 
Marshall are what Third College has always 
been about," said Lytle, who called the renam-
ing of the college a "point of arrival" for the 
institution. 

Lytle also described Marshall as a champion 
of rights for all Americans. "While it is 
important to recognize that he was a lawyer and 
jurist, his crowning achievement was in 
breaking down the access barriers to educa-
tion," he said. 

Marshall College sophomore Frances Hsieh, 
who served on the Third Student Council last 
year, agreed that Marshall was an appropriate

choice for the college ' s name because his belief 
in social responsibility is consistent with the 
principles of Third College. "It's easier to teach 
people what our college is about when they can 
associate our name with the ideals it repre-
sents," Hsieh said. 

''Thurgood Marshall College has a big, 
progressive philosophy. [The students learn) 
first to be open-minded to the fact that every-
one is different but equal. Second, we recog-
nize and study our differences. And third, we 
aim to educate the world of our different ethnic 
backgrounds," Hsieh added. 

Since its founding in 1970, UCSD's Third 
College had been in search of a name. "[The 
name] 'Third College' was not resonating in 
the broader community," Lytle said. 

Ln February, Political Science Professor 
Peter Irons wrote a letter to the Guardian 
suggesting that Third be renamed after 
Marshall, who had died a few weeks earlier. 
The suggestion was embraced by Lytle and 
later approved by Third College students. 

After receiving an endorsement from 
Atkinson, the name change was forwarded to 
the B'oard of Regents for approval. 

The regents voted unanimously to renamt! 
the college after Marshall at their May meeting.

When the academic year offi ciall y began on 
July I, Third College became Marshall Col-
lege. 

According to Hsieh, the new name will give 
the college a fresh start in "building student 
involvement and enthusiasm. We' re plann i·ng II 
lot of programs to bring us back the ideals of 
1970." 

A variety of free events will accompany the 
dedication ceremony throughout this week. 
Tonight at 7 p.m., Nobel Laureate Derek' 
Walcott will deliver a Helen Edison Lecture in 
the Mandeville Auditorium_ Walcott, whose 
melodious and sensitive poetry style won him 
the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992, wrote 10 
books of poetry and 12 plays reflecting the 
West Indian culture. 

In addition to her keynote address, Edelman 
will be give a lecture on Friday at 7 p.m. in the 
Price Center Ballroom. Edelman will lec ture on 
the "Modern American Family." According (0 
Lytle, Edelman was selected to appear at the 
dedication ceremony because of "her in volve-
ment with public issues and ocial conscience."

Keeling was established to draw up a 
proposal fOf the new Third College. 
Committee members suggested that 
the new college be called Clio after 
the Greek museofhistory. Realizing 
that Clio College could not solely be 
based upon historical studies, the 
committee expanded the curriculum 
to include archaeology, biophysics, 
physiology, theoretical physics and 
astrophysics.

MARSHALL COLLEGE PROVOST

35 percent Brown : ' A commineecom-
prised of minority students would 
control the admissions process. us the 
requirements set f!Jrth by the UC re-
gents were to be non-binding. 

A Revolutionary 
Curriculum 

The commillee also desired to 
revolutionize the curriculum of the 
college, as it believed that UCSO' !i 
current curriculum was "adehuman-
izing academic and formal isolation 
of the 'humanities ' from the sciences 
and the 'social sciences.''' Instead, 
Third College's curriculum was to 
be interdisciplinary with afocus upon 
ethnic studies. The significant 
courses were to focus upon the 
"theory and practice of revolutions, 
economic systems, science and tech-
nology, health sciences, urban and 
rural development, communications 
arts, foreign languages, cultural heri-
tage and white studies:' 

After numerous debates , the 
Board of Regents finally approved 
the revised academic plan for Third 
College on' February 20, 1970; how-
ever William Frazer, Third College 
Provost from 1969-70, refused to 
ask the regents to accept Lumumba-
Zapata as its formal name. "No way, 
of course, was the name Lumumba-
Zapata ever goi ng to be approved by 
the Academic Senate, much less the 
regents:' Frazer recalled , 

"And so, because the minority 
students were very much tied to that 
name, we [would) just not name the 
college and [would) call it whatever 
we wanted to. When I left the col-

, -- -

lege, I was given a pen and (1elici I set 
for going away, and it said , ' Bill 
Frazer, Provost Lumumba-Zaputu 
College.' So, my idea was not to ' 
name it at all. and then it would be 
Third College by tradition." 

In July, 1970,Joseph Watson was 
formally appointed as the new pro-
vost. On Sept. 26, Watson , now 
UCSD's vice chancellor for student 
affairs, invited the UCSD faculty to 
the opening ceremonies of Third 
College. In thebeginning, about two-
thirds of the incoming freshmen were 
underrepresented students: however, 
by 1976,60 percent of the first-year 
students were white. 

In an effort to return to the pri-
mary focus of Third College, Pro-
vost Lytle implemented several new 
programs focusing upon diversity, 
culture and ethnic studies. The Di-
mensionsofCultureProgram (DOC), 
approved for the 1990-'91 academic 
year, involves a three-course se-
quence of courses on diversity, jus-
tice and imagination. 

Finding a Name 
While Third College continued to 

revise its curriculum to accommo-
date the needs of the student body, it 
grappled with yet another problem 
- the name of the college, ' 'The 
problem was that the name 'Third 
College' just wasn ' t marketable. It 
was iII-<1efined and really didn't mean 
anything. We have never been able 
to transmit our energy off campus. 
The name 'Third College" just didn't 
convey what we were all about," 
Lytle said. 

According to Lytle, the whole 

renaming process was one of grudg-
ing indecision. "We wanted a r.ame 
that would do right by our people -
by all of our people. Thiscommunity 
said 'let's build a college ' and we 
wanted something to convey thi s," 
he added. 

Many suggestions were mulled 
over throughout the years, including 
Sequoia College, Freedom College, 
Discovery College and Ida B. Cox 
College. The most compelling, how-
ever, was a revival of the name Mar-
tin Luther King College in 1990, but, 
according to Lytle , "Mrs. King 
blocked this motion, as she wanted 
to build a college in Atlanta which 
would be dedicated to the funhering 
of her late husband 's ideals. She made 
it perfectly clear that she would not 
support the proposal , nor would she 
even be neutral." 

After throwing the name Martin 
Luther King College out of the run-
ning, Thurgood Marshall College 
became the next contender and was 
approved in May of 1993. Lytle said 
that "having the name 'Thurgood 
Marshall College' is an inspiration 
to us all. It implies a first rate dedica-
tion academics and societal issues. 

"The development of his ideas on 
fairness and the rights of the indi-
vidual began in the 1930s fighting 
racial discrimination in the south, 
but matured over the years as he 
became the champion of the cause of 
many other disenfranchised Ameri-
cans who were also the victims of 
systemic, governmentally-approved 
discrimination or neglect," Lytlesaid. 
"His name is something our college 
is worthy of." 

"Marshall was not an eloquent speaker, 
he did not lead marches or go to jail. He 

worked in courtrooms, helping to get people 
out of jail, to secure their rights to own a home, 
get a job, go to school and vote without regard 

to race, color, religion or sex. It was quiet 
work, but immensely effective."

H e was known by many names. To the people he represented in court for a quarter-century, he was 
known as "Mr. Civil Rights," and "Mr. 
Desegregation." For 24 years he was ad-
dressed as "Mr. Justice," but his clerks 
preferred to call him ''The Judge." To his 
friends, he was always Thurgood . 

~ history of the death penalty in America and 
elsewhere, Marshall concluded that "even 
if capital punishment is not excessive, it 
nonetheless violates the Eighth Amend-
ment because it is morally unacceptable to 
the people of the United States at thi s time 
in their histQry." 

Hail to the 

Thurgood Marshall was a man of many 
accomplishments. Even before his appoint-
ment as the first black man on the United 
States Supreme Court, Newsweek wrote: 

udge Although Marshall wrote his share of important majority opinions, he more often 
than not found himselfon the minority side, 
causing one scholar to call him "the great 
disse-nter.': Nevertheless, Brennen recalled, 
"whether or not [Marshall] prevailed in a 
given instance, he always had an impa~t." 

" In three decades he has probably done as 
much to transform the life of his people as 
any Negro alive today, including Nobel 
laureate Martin Luther King." 

In a tribute published in the Harvard 
Law Review, former justice William 
Brennan observed that, "Justice Marshall 
played a crucial role in enforcing the consti-
tutional protections that distinguish our de-
mocracy.lndeed, he leaves behind an envi-
able record of opinions supporting the rights 
of the less powerful and less fortunate. 

"One can then add that , for more than 25 
years before he joined the judiciary, 
Thurgood Marshall was probably the most 
important advocate in America, one who 
used his formidable legal skills to end the 
evils of discrimination," Brennan said. 

More than anyone else, Marshall is cred-
ited by legal scholars and historians as the 
man responsible for dismantling the legal 
foundations of racial seg regation in 
America. But Marshall was not predisposed 
to fighting racial injustice. 

Born in Baltimore in 1908, Marshall was 
the youngest son of mulatto parents. As a 
young boy, he experienced the usual treat-
ment that could be expected in a segregated

racial issues until he entered law school at 
Howard University. Under the tutelage of 
the pioneering civil rights attorney Charles 
Houston, Marshall became a diligent legal 
scholar and graduated at the top of his class. 

After a brief stint in private practice, 
Marshall became a legal assistant with the 
National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP) and ascended 
quickly through the ranks. Asdirector-coun-
sel of the NAACP's Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, Marshall argued 32 cases 
before the Supreme Court, winning all but 
four. During his 25-year tenure with the 
NAACP, Marshall made enormous strides 
in the legal battle for civil rights. His efforts 
led to the end of racially-restrictive cov-
enants barring blacks from buying houses. 
He helped win equal pay for black teachers 
and brought an end to the all-white primary 
school system in Texas. 

But Marshall's greatest victory by far 
came in 1954 with Brown v. Board ofEdu-
cdtioll, which brought an end to racial seg-
regation in public schools. Marshall later 
said the court's decision in Brown "prob-
ably did more than anything else to awaken 
the Negro from his apathy to demanding his 
right to equality." 

Appointed by President Lyndon Johnson 
to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967,MarshaIJ 
soon distinguished himself as the most lib-
eral member of a coun that became more

tenure. He was an ardent supporter of de-
fendants' rights, free speech and a woman's 
right to abortion. "What made Thurgood 
Marshall unique as a Justice?" Brennan 
wrote. "Above all, it was the special voice 
that he added to the Court's deliberations 
and decisions. His was a voice of authority: 
he spoke from firsthand knowledge of the 
law's failure to fulfill its promised protec-
tions for so many Americans." 

Marshall and Brennan stood alone on the 
court in their belief that the death penalty 

w~ without exception, "cruel and unusual 
punishment" under the Eighth Amendment 
and therefore unconstitutional. Marshall's 
opposition to capital punishment was fierce 
and unyielding. On one occasion, when 
then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist 
remarked that a death row inmate's appeals 
had placed a heavy burden on taxpayers, 
Marshall snapped, "it would have been 
cheaper to shoot him right after he was 
arrested, wouldn't it?" 

In 1972, the court vindicated Marshall's 
view in Furman v. Georgia, determining 
that capital punishment is unconstitutional. 
The court later reversed itself. 

Marshall's 60-page concurrence in 
Furman, which employs a vast array of 
historical and sociological sources to dem-
onstrate that the death penalty is excessive 
whenjudged by contemporary standards, is 
cited by some scholars as a classic example 
of his relentless judicial style. 

After an exhaustive discussion of the 

"He has remain~d a conscience on the 
bench," Juan Williams wrote in th~ Wash-
ington Post in 1990, "never wavering in his 
devotion to ending discriminhtion:' In his 
last years on the bench, Marshall became 
more and more frustrated with what he 
described as "a retrenching of the civil 
rights agenda" running "full circle" back to 
the days when separate but equal was the 
law of the land. 

In an interview between Williams and 
Marshall a yeaI" before· hi s retirement, 
Marshall lamented what he considered to 
be a lack of awareness of the effect of 
racism on the part of his colleagues. "They 
need to stop looking for excuses not to 
enforce the 14th Amendment as it was in-
tended to be enforced," Marshall said. 

Though serious and unswerving in his 
legal opinions, Marshall is also remem-
bered by friends and colleagues for his rich 
sense of humor. He would often address 
Chief Justice Warren Burger as "chiefy-
baby." Brennan said Marshall was "simply 
unsurpassed as a raconteur." 

In 1990, Marshall told the Washington 
Post that, "I have a lifetime appointment 
and I intend to serve it," adding with his 
characteristic wit, "I expect to die at 110, 
shot by a jealous husband:' Marshall, 84 
years old and long-plagued by heart and 
respiratory ailments, died on Jan. 24, 1993.
