BerkeJey ' - University of 
California President David 
Saxon said here Wednesday 
that he does "not think it will be 
neceasary to deal with student 
tuition" next academic year. 

In an interview with Tile 
Guardia, Saxon said that he is 
"lOmewhat optimiatic" that 
tuition will not be necessary to 
make up for bud,et losses 
incurred after the passage of 
Propoaition 13. "If you were to 
ask me to bet on wbether we 
would have to ,0 through that 
enonnously complicated and 
divisive and difficult process 
(of institutin, tuition) for the 
'71-10 budlet year, I would bet 
not," Saxon declared. 

Saxon refused to rule out the 
possibility of tuition, though. 
This year's state budget cuts 
were compensated for by 
student Educational Fees, 
which will not be available next 
year. Tberefore, Saxon ex-
plained, "the really critical 
element is whether we get state 
support. All funding sources 
are from the state." 

Saxon added that if the 
University doesn't get the 
money it wants from the state, 
it will be left witb .. some 

difficult questions" regardin, 
tuition. 

Saxon resisted the University 
Student Body Presidents Coun-
cU's (SBPC) allegation that he 
had included the f75 .5 million 
100t in Prop. 13 cuts in his 
bud,et requests to the board of 
~gents, knowing that the 
University would not receive 
the money. Subsequently, UC 
could rush througb a student 
tuition next spring when the 
money didn't come through, 
alleged the SBPC. 

"There's nothing Machia-
vellian about it," Saxon said of 
his request, approved by the 
Regents Oct. 20. "Tbe students 
seem to think it's a plot. That's 
absurd. 

"The imposition of tuition is 
so complicated - you've got so 
many forces, so many inter-
ests, so many agencies - that 
you couldn't possibly do it on 
short notice," Saxon claimed. 

He added that the only 
circumstances that could cause 
tbe Re,ents to institute a tuition 
on short notice would be if "the 
governor's budget is stag-
geringly different" than Saxon 
expects it to be. 

Saxon has not yet decided 
what his recommendation to 
the Relents will be as to UC' 

faculty and stau pay increuea, 
thoulh be did say that be planl 
to recommend "substantial" 
raises. At the Regent's rneetina 
Oct. 20 in San Francisco, Saxon 
stated that faculty salaries 
would have to be railed 14% to 
be competitive with other 
major universities, and even 
more than that to be on a par 
with what he called " the very 
best institutions in the coun-
try. " 

Last year the University 
asked for a 9 .7'0 hike in 
faculty and staff pay, and got 
nothina after Governor Brown 
vetoed an increase. 

Saxon bad some harsh words 
for Brown, who, he said, "bears 
a large responsibility" for the 
low pay of UC personnel 
relative to other universities. 
Saxon claimed that past in-
creases allowed by Brown were 
" inadequate" and that the 
cumulative effect of the Brown 
and Reagan administrations' 
treatment of UC salaries bas 
left the University "way behind 
and in trouble." 

Saxon also alleged that 
Brown has done less for the 
University than he has claimed .

Aaodate News EdI .... 

In order to aid in the dis-
bursement of over -ft million of 
student monies, the Regis-
tration Fee Committee has 
selected six areas into which 
they will send interns for the 
purpose of producing an in-
depth report in each area. 

The committee, which ad-
vises Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs Richard Armitage 
on how to allocate student 
registration fees, passed a 
motion last week to increase 

the budget of the Intern 
Program by $2,400 in order to 
provide two additional interns, 
bringing the total to six. The 
interns will be sent into the 
various Student Affairs units 
that are funded by registration 
fees to provide the committee 
members with the information 
necessary to decide on funding 
levels .. 

The six areas to be covered 
by the interns are:

area allows for research and

improve the process of in(or-
mation flow to students. 

-Recfeation athletics. An in-
depth analysis of this unit will 
be done, as it receives the third 
largest allocation of Reg Fee 
money and. ranks third in 
importance to students ac-
cording to the Student Opinion 
Survey. . 

- Counseling services. This 
area receives the second 
largest allocation of Reg' Fee 
money. Intern will research 
these services from a student 
perspective. Research will not 
be limited to only psychological 
services, but academic as well. 

-Residence halls. This area 
receives a relatively small 
budget, but probably has a 
major impact on students. Most 
students first experience UCSD 
while living in the dorms. 
Questions to be researched are: 
What kind of an experience is 
it? Does the experience have 
any bearing on the high rate o( 
attrition or the excessively 
heavy use of counseling serv-
ices? 

-Retention. This is problem-
atic at UCSD, especially at 
Third College. The intern will 
seek to find out why there is not 
a close community feeliDi at 
UCSD and a coordinate effort 
will be made by the committee 
to do something about this 
problem.

having representatives from 
each campus meet monthly to

Reactionary Guardian Tradition 
Editor: 

Congratulations, The staff of 
the Triton Times/Guardian, 
not to be confused with The 
Guardian which is pubUshed 
out of New York, is successfully 
maintaining a reactionary 
tradition of whicb a Bircber 
could well be proud. From the 
paper's foundinl it has at-
tacked progressive move· 
ments, Tbird World and minor-
ity peoples, and people in 
general. The paper has consis· 
tently upbeld tbe Adminis-
tration, aDd the Administration 
has done well by it. Well over 
$100,000 have been poured into 
Tri&oll Times coffers by the 
Administration since 1974, the 
year of the infamous "April 
Fool's issue" in wbich the 

Times attacked Third Colle,e, 
and minority students in 
general with a front page 
sporting such articles as 
"Shockley Appointed Provost 
at Third" , and an article on the 
proposed construction of 
Third College buildings con-
taining innumerable racial 
slurs. 

The Trite·On Times has 
maintained this tradition by 
running ads and editorials for 
tbe CIA and the Navy, by 
viciously attacking the Student 
Cooperative Union when the 
Administration mounted its 
campaign to smash this organ-
ization, and by its general 
policy of distorting reality and 
misleadinlstudents. The paper 
has served the Administration

saYI~g he was basing his

has been dOminated by per.

In a speech Saturday night in

Nutrition Labeling Examined by FDA 
By 0.., Campion

must appear " on all foods for 
which a nutritional claim is 
made or to which a nutrient has 
been added." According to the 
information surveyed, only 
Mo of all packaled foods sold 
nationally bear labels with this 
information, however. Many 
foods are exempted from the 
labeline law due to a lelal 
loophole. If a manufacturer 
incorrecUy liata the ingredients 
on the pacu,e of a product, or 
If tbe adverti.ing for that 
product I. "fal.e and mi.-
leadi",," the loveroment is 
empowered to take action. If, 
however. no claim la made 
about the food directly, but 

In an effort to .tandardize 
nutritional content information 
on food paCkalea, the federal 
lovernment la .tudyiDJ a large 
sample of the Iabela currently 
uaed In markeUDJ foods. The 
study. a joint effort of the 
Department of Acriculture, the 
Food and Dnae Administration 
and the Federal Trade Com-
miaaiaa, baa 10 far bl'OUlllt to 
lipt many of the difficulties 
COIIIUIIIerI encounter io at-
temptiq to CODItn1ct a well-
balanced diet for themselves. 

M required by law. already 
in existence, nutrition labeUne 

instead it is praised in the 
words 0(' 'satisfied customen" 
or through quotations from 
articles written about it, the 
manufacturer is protected by 
the Flnt Amendment to the 
Constitution. 

One example of unclear 
labelln, which was recently 
• 'remedied" by federal regu-
lation is that of low and reduced 
calorie foods. The use of these 
terms in reference to diet foods 
was previously determined by 
the manufacturer of the prod-
uct . Now. however. food. 
beariDJ the claSSification " low 
calorie" muat contain no more 
than 40 calories per serving, 

and those termed " reduced 
calorie" must be shown to have 
at least one-third fewer calories 
than the non-dietetic food it was 
designed to substitute. Both 
classes of food are required to 
exhibit nutritional content on 
their packagin,. 

Another common problem is 
in the labeling of health foods. 
Words such as " natural . " 
" or,anic" and " health" have 
never been defined by one 
reco,nized authority. There-
fore, the terms are applied to a 
wide variety of nutritional, and 
sometimes not-so-nutritional, 
SUbstances. Everything from 
alfalfa .prouts to potato chips 

has been labeled " natural" and 
fertilizers as well as breads are 
called "organic." 

Although health foods may be 
free of the chemical preserv-
atives and refined sugar so 
dreaded today , t he r e a re 
dangers associated with these 
products . also. Lettuce and 
celery, for example, naturally 
conta in nitrate and nitrite 
compounds - chemical IU~ 
stances currently suspected to 
be cancer-causing a,ents . 
Corn, peanuts and maDY ,rains 
provide ,ood growing surfaces 
for a mold called aflatoxin, 
known to be a powerful car-
cinogen. 

Heart Disease on Decline in US StaDdardized labelin, will serve as an aid in helpiDg consumers determine which foods are " good (or them" and 
which foods should be included 
in a diet to ensure proper 
nutrition. 

By Warrell E. Leary 
AP SeieIIee WrI&er 

WASHINGTON - Ameri-
cans apparently are beeding 
advice to cut down dietary fats , 
smoking and blood pressure, 
but there is little hard evidence 
on how much this is responsible 
for declining heart disease 
death rates. 

Heart disease experts meet-
ing at the National Institutes of 
Health said Wednesday that 
they have "gut feelings" and 
indications that reducing these 
risk factors is at least partially 
responsible for the decrease in 
cardiovascular disease death 
rates. 

But there bas to be more to it 
than that, they add. 

"It is clear we are doing 
somethin, right In the United 
States. " said Dr. Jeremiah 
Stamler of Northwestern 
University Medical School in 
Chicago. "We are doing better 
than any other industrial 
country at reducing the death 
rate. We admittedly started 
hi,her than most. but we are 
still making progress." 

Heart and blood vessel 
problems still represent the 
nation 's No. 1 killer disease, 
taking almost 1 million lives a 
year. 

Stamler said he and Dr. Alan 
R. Dyer, also of Northwestern. 
just completed a statistical 
study which indicates that 
changes in average blood 
pressure. smoking and blood 
cholesterol in m iddle-aged 
white men over the last 20 years 
could be responsible for much 
of their decreased c ardiac 
death rate. 

Looking at the numbers for 
these risk factors in 8. 100 men 
tested in the 195Os, the scien-
tists calculated the deathrate 
change for this group if the 
measurements had been re-
duced to mid-l97Os levels. 

SIO Ship Completed These figures projected a death rate' reduction for this group of 18.5 percent. very 
close to the actual mortality

Tbe first research assign-

Ocean. wbere its 13 scientific 
personnel will work in con-
junction with the California 
Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries 
Investi,ations and the Mexican 
Instituto Naclonal de Pesca to 
study the California Current. 
The fundinllor this and most of 
the vessel's operations will be 
provided by the state of 
California. 

New Horizon's 1,150 square 
feet of laboratory space will 
also be utilized in research 
studies financed by the Na-
tional Science Foundation and 
by the Office of Naval Re-

Statistics said data on cigarette 
smokin, is so sketchy that it is 
impossible to sbow definitively 
that many adults giving up the 
habit have contributed to 
reduced heart disease death 
rates. 

Ironically, he noted, white 
women, who are a t lowest risk 
of heart disease and whose 
cardiac death rate has declined 
more than any other group, are 
smoking more than ever be-
fore . Th is indica tes other 
factors must be at work, he 
added.

Gautier Not Quite

By Tim Mackenzie 
COIIIrtIMl&blI Edllor 

Veteran T.V. sitcom funny-
man Dick Gautier opened his 
stand-up comedy act Wednes-
day at the Comedy Store in .La 
Jolla, with the results beIDg

looked tight, forgot his Unes, 
but still managed to pull 
through, no easy cbore given 
the lackluster rouUne he had. 

A performer on numerous 
television shows including Get 
Sman (GauUer portrayed the 
robot Hymie), Love Americaa 
Style and Wben Tllblp Were 

. RotteD, Gautier developed an 
authentic comedic charm. He 
was funny and charming, a 
man who could make you laugh 
and also let the girl. But on 
T.V., the advantage is that you 
can re-shoot scenes to make the 
character as perfect as you 
want it. But on the stage. live 
before an audience, the matter 
is different. 

Gautier had reason to be 
nervous. He was trying some-
thing new for him, being a 
standup comic in a place where 
people come to la~gh. If ~e 
expects to further hlB career In 
this line of work, by doing 
Vegas and the Johnny Carson 
Show and all that stuff, he has 
got to get a good act together .. 
He bas aillo got to memorize it. 
Gautier constantly had to look 
at his cue sheet (which he kept 
in his coat pocket) . At first it 
was funny, but after a while it 
just became an embarrass-

ment. 
SUll Guatier had his mo-

ments: He does a good routine 
about his French uncle (though 
it needed direction) and had 
some funny interaction with the 
audience. 

Opening for Gautier was 
another comedian, Thom 
Sharp. Sharp opened impres-
sively for Mort Sahl at the 
Comedy Store last spring, and 
I'm pleased to report that he is 
still as funny. Maybe more so. 
Sharp, a young ~an with a 
large bald spot, looks so 
straightforward that one might 
mistake him for an Indiana 
schoolteacher. Until the panty-
hose goes over his face, that is. 

His routine might remind one 
of Steve Martin, being in the 
same zany, craaaazy guy mold. 
But Sharp has some really good 
material of his own, including a 
hilarious song he wrote (and 
played on guitar) called "Surf-
ing For Peace." It's about a 
summit conference among 
world leaders held at Malibu 
Beach. "Idi Amin likes to hang 
men, but up at Malibu he'll be 
hanging ten, they'll be surfing, 
surfing for peace." Watch for 
this guy, Thorn Sharp. He'sjust 
got to be a superstar.

What? 't Ian't even Thanksgiving yet and here I am 
worried about flna'a. Beet sol ution to make aur. you 
ar. through that reading list and understand 
everything in those texts: sign up NOW for the 
R.E.A.D.S. Rapid Reading and Comprehension 
class, especially for UCSD students. 

- .a'. A eft .. World - Axis 
(RCA) 

For thoae who mil8ed out, we 
have in Axi. a too-rare example 
of Sixties psychedelia that 
ranks with the best of the Blues 
Magoos, 13th Floor Elevators, 
The Muaic Machine, The Count 
Five, The Electric Prunes, The 
Seeds, The Leaves, The Amboy 
Dukes, The Barbarians, The 
Peanut Butter Conspiracy, 
Frijid Pink, David Axelrod and 
a hundred other now-obscure 
bands that have been shelved 
along with other rock and roll 
arcana. SociologicaHy, psy-
chedelic music occurred in the 
late Sixties when drugs, most 
notably LSD and other chem-
icals that transfigured one's 
perceptual apparatuses into a 
parabola of crazy-quilt sur-
realism, became the latest hip 
fashion among youth ("coun-
ter") culture. Many young rock 
bands flirted with the effects of 
these synthetic substances, and 
in their need to make their 
music become something more 
than just throwaway pop-
culture artifacts (a symptom 
resulting from the release of 
the overpraised Sit. Pepper 
album), sought to express their 
extraterrestrial "insights" and 
"understandings" in song. The 
net results were _ preciously 
naive lyrics about love, peace, 
the search for inner essences 
divorced from materialistic 
restriction, knee-jerk fantasies 
about high-jaCking starships, 
the p.ffusiveness of nature, 
paens against violence and in 
general expressions about the 
need to escape from the 
bummer of the old folk's 
competitive reality . To amplify 
the themes and the art- con-
sciousness of the music, there 
were interminable guitar solos 
replete with scratch-fuzz tone 
effects. gratuitous sitar play-
ing, classical quotes , dead 
serious singing that sounds like 
the mewling of a spoiled rich 
kid and so on. Sixties psyche-
delia , for all its avowed 
seriousness and cerebral 
assertions, was a time of 
supreme innocence that's been, 
assumedly, lost forever in the 
wake oC history. Those bands' 
efforts were the prattlings of a 
bright child playing with 
advanced concepts that the 
child was incapable of under-
standing. . 

Psychedelia, in sentiment at 
least, hasn't been lost com-
pletely. Axis, the former back-
up band for Rick Derringer, are 
on the surface one of the many 
competent but undistinguished 
heavy metal bands vieing Cor 
the edge oC Ted Nugent ' s 
spotlight, but lyrically they've 
placed themselves in a cosmic 
time warp, quite distinct Crom 
Nugent's ersatz machismo or 
hard rock's penchant for cock 
pride themes . On "Juggler," 
lead guitariSt/songwriter 
Danny Johnson sings: "Time is ' 
like a monster/ .. .it can never 
be stopped/Turn it all around, 
turn it upside down/You just 
can' t break God's clock." Who 
else but a spiritual child of the 
Sixties psychedelic naturalism 
would have the gall to deliver a 
fractured evangelical sermon 
to an audience that expects its 
heavy metal lyrics to be as 
Hobbesian as the music it elf? 
In " Ray's Electric Farm" (a 
perfect title , perhaps in mem-
ory of the Electric Comic 
-, ' . . 

" .. , tit; f ,. , , .,. '\ ~ ... , " ,-16· 

Books, Electric Flags, Electric 
Prunes, Electric Circuses, 
electric any things of the 
Sixties), .Johnson posits the 
anUquated notion that he can 
rind an earthly utopia: "I'm 
going down to Ray's electric 
farm/Where the nights last for 
days and/Guitars grow on the 
lawn ... " Johnson is a visionary 
who thinks that rock and roll 
ought to be organic and free of 
utility bills. Presumably, all a 
rocker need do on the "electric 
Carm" is plug into the nearest 
bush and let the music rip. 

johnson has a subversive 
personality at heart, a mind 
that seeks to undermine the 
residing murder mentality 
nihilims that dominates hard-
heavy metal rock and replace it 
with the cosmic effusiveness 

that rock audiences repudiated 
lonl ago in favor of either 
necrophiliac nostalgia (Hen-
drix, Dylan hero worshipping) 
or jaded cynicism (the I-only-
listen-to-tbe-obscure-albums 
school or rock criticism) . 
Johnson is a dumb kid who has 
assumed the piousness of 
progressive rock bands like 
Yes and Kansas and is de-
livering the message in plainer 
language through a more easily 
understood motiC. It probably 
won't be long when Johnson and 
Axis will have their lyrics on 
the thin lips of hard rock fans 
everywhere, lips that used to 
scream the steamy macho 
boasts of "Cat Scratch Fever" 
a nd " Hot Blooded . " The 
proposition is downright scary.

It took four ,ames but the 

Redlands women's volleyball 
team overcame a Triton threat 
and beat the women's volley-
ball team in the Main Gym 
Friday evenin,. 3-1. 

Team member Dawn Wilson 
felt that the team had •• a really 
,ood start." They won the flnt 
and third ,ames but dropped 
the rest. "Our ,ame fell apart 
because we all ,ot upti,bt," 
Wilson added. 

Last Wednesday ni,bt's 
,ame was a different story as 
the Triton. toppled USIU for 
the second time tbiI season. 

"It was a ,ood match." 
commented Cheryl Wri,ht. "it 
wasn't supposed to be an easy 
one." Playin, a stron, third 
,ame, the combined efforts of 
Wright. Ber,ado and Prather 
kept the DolphinS tied at 14-14. 
A stron, offensive USIU team 
broke the tie and won. 16-14. 

The TritoDl tried to tum 
thiqs around in the fourtb 
,ame with a successful drive 
led by Sberri Lilley . "We 
played much more a"res-
sively in the last ,ame, ,. added 
Lilley. "I really tbink we 
expected to win it in four 
lames." Witb an offensive 
attack, Lilley earned ber team 
points durillJ the fourth ,ame.

UCSD splten 10 up for a block iJt fierce compe&i&ioD. 

Altbou,h tbe teams were 
evenly matcbed, the Tritons 
maD8,ed to skewer the Dol-
phins, 15-11, 16-14, 14-16 and 15-
13. "Our offen.e was on and our 
defen.e was there," exclaimed 
Beth Prather over the team's 
slim win in the flnt ,ame. 

In the second ,ame UCSD 
came from behind 6-12, due to 
Cely Bereado's apikinl and all-
around net play, whicb tied the 
score at 12 all. Teaminl up with 
Dawn Wilson, Ber,ado 
smasbed consecutive shots to 
har opponent's weak spots . 
USIU failed to break UCSD 
momentum and lost the ,ame 
by two points. 

Head coacb Grace Green-
bur, commended Lilley's 
efforts that "without ber. we'd 
bave our troubles." Sbe also 
praised Ann Isbihara for her 
excellent defen.ive playinl· 
"With Ann's consistent per-
formances, she simplifies tbe 
team's efforts," explained 
Greenburl, after Wednesday 
niJbt's matcb. Ishihara played 
an impressive final lame, 
where she was aided by team-
mate Nancy Wada on several 
occasions.

The Liooa pounced on the 
Tritons early in the fint balf. A 

tall Loyola forward broke 
throuab the defen.e and abot 
without any UCSD hindrance, 
maldnC the score 1-0. San Diego 
stayed on the attack much of 
the remainder of the period, 
but several Gold attempts 
missed and the score stayed at 
1-0 at balftime. 

FenCers Outduel S8 Tbe Tritons again failed to capitalise on early second balf scoring opportunities . The Lions couldn't wait for their 
opponents to catch up, though, 
and went abead 2-0 on a 
successful direct kick. Lose to UCLA to Split First Matches 

By PbiUp Soreasen 
Tbe UCSD fendnl team 

opened its 1978 season 
Saturday at UCLA by splitting 
matches with UCLA and UCSB, 
losing to UCLA by an overall 
score of 17-19, and beating 
UCSB, 23-13. 

Against UCLA, the men took 
two of the three events (the foil 
and the epee) , and the women 
won their event, but UCSD still 
lost the bout. The men foilists 
and epeeists both won by scores 
of H . but UCLA's saberists 
outdueled UCSD to take a 7-2 
victory in this event, providing 
a big enough margin of victory 
in the overall scoring . Th~ 

fencers , who 
,..acuce tbeir moves. 

women squeaked by their 
opponents, 5-4. 

UCSD had an easier time of it 
against the UCSB fencers , 
alain winnin, in each event 
except for one, tbis time 
coming out ahead in tbe end. 
Tbe men's team lost foil, 5-4, but 
got victories in the sabre and 
epee with identical 6-3 scores. 
The women's team, with Kathy 
Kassebaum leading the way, 
took a 7-2 win in the foil event. 

Kassebaum finished the day 
with an individual record of 5-1. 
beating two of UCLA's women 
and aU three of VCSB's women 
foilists . Greg Lee, UCSD's 
number one saberist, was the 
men's standout.

,...,..,. .... -

"I was pleased with Greg's 
work." said coacb John Hel-
mich. "It looked like he was 
much improved from last 
year." 

Though not overly ecstatic 
about the team's performance. 
Helmich felt that the matches 
Saturday were beneficial in 
other areas besides the win-loss 
column. "It (the match) was 
about what I expected. We 
fenced two teams who are 
fairly weak. It·s nice to be able 
to start out like that because it 
gives us a chance ' to find out 
where we' re at and what we 
need to work on." 

UCSD sees action again Nov. 
4 in a dual meet against CSUF 
and ·CSULA. at CSULA. 
. 

Realizing the urgency of the 
situation, and hoping to avoid 
their fourth straight shutout, 
the UCSD offensive forces went 
to work. Gold found himself 
alone in front of the net and he 
kicked in a qu.ick goal. Before 
the team could start cele-
brating their first goal in nearly 
two weeks. however. the score 
was annulled on an offsides 
call. 

Not giving up on account of 
that. Bruce Logan forced the 
goalie to take an illegal amount 
of steps. giving the Tritons a 
penalty kick 15 yards from the 
net. Gold took the ball after the 
kick and put it past the Loyola 
goalie for the first actual UCSD 
point. Time ran out before San 
Diego could put together

another scoring drive and they

their season effort to a 5-7-1 
record. 

Tbe Tritons seek a needed 
win Tuesday wben they face 
Azusa Pacific at home. They 
play 2: 30 at Muir Field. . 

Thou,h fruatrated over the 
team's loss of a game and his 
personal loss of a goal, Gold 
sees some hope from the Triton 
performance. "The team plays 
well together. We're passing 
well and we're learning finer 
positioning and passing tech-
niques now." 

Ironically. some of the best 
UCSD games have been in their 
losses. "We dominate almost 
every game we play - even 
against San Diego State," said 
Gold. 

Coach Stewart Hayes also is 
frustrated-over the latest loss. 
"I t!iought we played pretty 
well . The teams were pretty 
evenly matched. but they had 
less scoring chances than us. 
We just couldn't 'finish' our 
drives (with a goal) ." ,

Ramones (Searchers) . The 
Ramones bave done notable 
remakes before ("California

because they have reflected the 
band's uncompromising ap-
proach: very loud, very fast . 
The most striking aspect of 
their version of " Needles "

Bono) is that it doesn' t sound

consciously try to evoke the pop

tempt an interesting timel 
space transformation of the 
Gene Pitney-penned classic -
from early '60s New York to 
Carson (CA) '78. Their nearly

is very cool and downright 
appealing.

A decade or so ago this would

"Surfin' USA" straight out of 
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little

sounding even worse than their 
lame new originals. In short, a 
pathetic reminder this band 
should have called it quits loog 
ago.

---~----------------

••• one, available for the 
Hum~nltl .. and Social Sciences 
at UCSD Is Inadequate. 

(C.L from paJe 1) 
woneaed tbe ItudeDt to faculty 
ratio, it'l about wben it W81 
wbeD be 'toot office." Saxon 
explalDed tbat "under RUlan 
the .tudent to faculty ratio 
became much worae, but tbe 
fiIurea are tbe aame DOW. He 
(Brown) bun't moved UI back 
toward wbere we were before 
Reaaan became ,overnor." 

Saxon alao laid that "Brown 
baa not treated the faculty any 
better than Rea,an did, and 
maybe wone. With reaped to 
overall support, we haven't 
fared very well under Governor 
Brown and we didn't fare very 
well UDder Governor Rea,an. 
To me it's a little bit like 
makina a choice between the 
fryiq pan and the fire." 

Saxon added that bpth Brown 
and Realan "bad an attitude 
about tbe University Which, 
while the attitudes were very 
different, tended to be su~ 
portive." 

In response to criticism 
voiced by some students 
claiming that UC San Diego is 
too scientifically oriented, 
Saxon acknowledged that the 
money available for the Hu-
manities and social sciences at 
UCSD is inadequate. 

"They (UCSD) started with a 
very logical scheme of de-
velopment in building around 
Scripps," Saxon said. "They 
began to develop certain 
science graduate departments, 
and those were the first in what 
was intended to be a continuing 
development. 

" Those were reasonably 
completed," Saxon said. "They 
began to develop certain 
science graduate departments, 

Clean Air 
(Cont. from page 1) 

Implementation of the RAQS 
tactics will bring San Diego 
County into compliance with 
the 1977 amendments to the 
federal Clean Air Act. Ac-
cording to Aulick, the RAQS 
report consists of strategies 
which would allow San Diego to 
meet federal standards for four 
pollutants: ozone (photochemi-
cal smog) , carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen dioxide and particu-
late matter (sand, gravel and 
dUBt) . 

The RAQS report contains 
technical, industrial and motor 
vehicle controls to be used by 
the federal and state govern-
ments and the APCD. 

RAQS tactics include: 
-Tlgbteoing emission stan-

dard, on gas stations and 
indust ial surface coatings. 
The .:: 0 has noted that the 
techrlieal practicability and 
cost related to a large change in 
fuel blend And diatribution 
would be a problem. (;on-
cerning surface coatings, 
Aulick said the paint used could 
not ~Dtain hydrocarbons. 

-Controlling emissions from 
off-road heavy-duty vehicles, 
motor driven cycles and sur-
face cleaninl operations. The 
CPO suggested the possibility 
of installinl electric generators 
and boilers in new automobiles, 
but San Dielo Gas and Electric 
obJ~ted to this tactic because 
it will only add to the electrical 
abortale problem, Aulick said. 

and thole were the first in what 
wu intended to be a continuinJ 
development. 

"Tbole were realonably 
completed," Saxon continued, 
"and tbeD the lJ'eat slowdown 
came. You bad a situation 
where tbe science prolf8JD8 
were started earlier and 
finished earlier wbile the others 
(Humanities and social sci-
ences) were only partly 80," he 
explained. 

Saxon hastened to add, 
thoulh, that "the chancellor 
(McElroy)' has very often made 
clear to me his concern in 
developinl humanities and 
social sciences. He feels 
stroDlly it's an important thing 
to do,but resource limitations 
have made them go more 
slowly perhaps than had been 
intended.' , 

Saxon reiterated the position 
he took last June on the issue of 
UC divestiture of stock holdinls 
in companies doing business in 
South Africa, when be said that 
although he believed that South 
African apartheid was "ully 
and abhorrent," he thought 

•• 

tbat the Relents u partial 
owners of companies "ibould 
exert every influence to insure 
that the corporatioDl do DOth-
inJ to furtber apartheid," and 
"should exert every influence 
to lee that corporations do all 
poaible to speed apartheid to 
its certain end." 

On tbe aubJect of the Supreme 
Court's Bakke decision, Saxon 
elaim~ that it was not hiljob to 
decide on neceuary reforms, 
addinl that chanles in the UC 

Davll ' Medical School ad-
mJulODl proJI'am bad been 

. made by the school', faculty. 
Saxon also laid that' the
