Local developers send a message to UCSD 
By EILEEN MORRIS and STEVE STOY ANOW Staff Writers 

"There's nothing on a 
railroad track here," Jim Hare 
told six new members of the 
U n ivers it y Communit y 
Planning Group Tuesday 
night. Hare, a community 
planner for the city of an 
Diego, was referring to the 
University Community Plan. 
soon to come before the San 
Diego City Council, and the 
s ubject of much debate in the 
local community. The plan 
proposes rezoning much of the 
land surrounding UCSD from 
an Rl ·5 (residential) zone, to a 
CA (commercial) which allows 
for intensive commercial and 
office use. 

Roger Reve lle, one o f 
UCSD's founders . di sagrees 
with Hare's analysis of the 
s ituation. Revelle believes that 
the proposed developments, 
\ovhich includes five hotel s. 
four offi e parks and a number 
of sky scrapers to the east of 

UCSD. are not in the best 
interest of the university. He 
stresses that the realiza tion of 
these dev elopment s w ill 
constitute a betrayal by the 
city of San Diego of an 
agreement entered into with 
the univers ity in 1959, to the 
effect that the area around 
UCSD would become a 
"college town;" the majority of 
the land was originally to have 
been used to create affordable 
residential housing for the 
campus community. 

One board member expres" 
sed concern at Tuesday's 
meeting that " thi s trend 
(commercial development) is 
not one coming from within 
the community. This is a trend 
that is b~in~ thrust upon the 
communIty. 

The area in question is 
roughly 9,000 acres of land 
bordered by Interslate 5 on the 
west, Highv,'ay 805 on the east. 

and High way 52 on the south. 
Developers have" named the 
area "the Golden Triangle," 
because of its money-making 
potential, a potential. they 
claim, that commercial and 
indust rial development would 
serve better tha n exclusivelv 
residential development. -

Projects proposed by various 
developers include: 

- a Sheraton Hotel on La 
Jolla Village Drive directly 
across frGln the l lni versitv 
Towne Center " 

- Brittany Village, a 
comb ination comme rcia l/ 
residential project located at 
the intersection of La 10lla 
Village Dr. and Genesee Ave. 
co mpri sed of a hotel, 
condominiums. and shops 

- La Jolla Int ernationa l

The UCSD crisis 
overcrowding and 
lack of space 

As we are all hanging in there in this, the last 
week of free ads and drops, waiting patiently in 
positions far: down on the class waiting list for 
the possiblity of an opening, it becomes apparent 
that we are in the middle of a campus crisis. 
UCSD has a housing shortage. There is not 
eno~h room to house the 13,000 plus student 
population in our limited campus classrooms. 

Students are suffering, and, with the exception 
of the construction now underway on the Third 
College campus, nothing is being done to combat 
the problem. Professor's salaries are being used 
inefficiently, students are given ludicrous class 
hours, and hundreds of students are being turned 
away from lectures they are required and desire 
to take. Yet, there are buildings on this campus 
which are not being utilized. 

Professors have to turn away hundreds of 
students on waiting lists due to a shortage of 
seats in the lecture halls. It is a waste of a 
professor's salary when he is capable and willing 
to accomodate an extra one hundred students in 
his class. Laws forbid students sitting on the 
stairs and in the aisles, filling lecture halls over 
their capacities. 

Clearly, we need more large lecture halls, 
especially if UCSD plans to continue with its 
increasing acceptance rates of 500 additional 
students per year. 

The General Campus Classroom being built at 
Third College will have two major lecture halls 
accomodating 700 students total, and three 
smaller rooms accomodating a total of 220. This 
is a wise move on behalf of the planning 
commission, yet it is not projected to be 
completed until the middle of the Fall Quarter of 
1983, and will not be in full use until the Winter 
of 1984. This is too late for the problems that are 
occuring now. 

We would like to know why buildings like 
Mandeville Auditorium are not being used for 
lectures when space is such a problem. Presently 
Mandeville is used for finals and midterms - it 
obviously can accomodate student. Yet the

Letter to the Editor 

Mitch Sosna misunderstood 
Editor: 

I am writing this in response 
to the article written by Mitch 
Sosna regarding the state 
educational budget. It would 
be appreciated if in the future 
when someone is asked a 
question of such importance 
that he ls he be quoted 
correctly. [ was misunder· 
stood and mIsquoted. I would 
like to clarify that the Muir 
College Council had discussed 
the issue at our meeting last 
Thursday, Jan. 6 just prior to 

Parking 
Editor: 

Recently, while trying to 
park my car on a campus lot in 
the Revelle area, I was 
appalled and surprised at the 
number of other students who, 
like myself, were searching for 
a parking space. 

Can't something be done 
about thiS prohlem? I realize 
that the university is strapped 
for money , but I can 't really 
helieve that a new parking lot 
would cost that much. Forone, 
the amount of money which 
parking violat ion fees bring in 
- alone - would, I think, pay 
for new parking spaces. And 
moreover, land shou ld not be a 
prohlem: a dozen or so acres of 
unused land exist in and 
arou nd the Revelle area . 

What adds in"ult to injury i" 
the fact that ample number of 
parking spaces abound on the 
R 'velle and Muir lots - but 
only before 10:00 and after 
1:00. Couldn't a more efficient 
..,ystem be worked out whereby 
s paces will be unoccupied 
whell nec'Cled ? 

Michael R. Riggs 

my being asked for a response 
to this issue . What r expressed 
to Mitch is that students will 
be frustrated with the fee 
increases, but that the 
increase is not something 
which has been unanticipated. 
It seems that with the changes 
in society and the economy 

that it is almost inevitable that 
the educational fees would 
eventually change also. Weare 
all concerned and wish to do 
whatever possible as students 
to meet these changes.

The day of the 
political penguin 

By MARK P. lJIAMOND 
At dawn on a seemingly 

average clay at UCSD, a 
maintenance employee was 
walking across Ihe campus. 
On his way past the gym, he 
noticed something quite 
strange - waddling around on 
top of the hump was a penguin. 

The maintenance employee 
wa ' s hocked. Hi s union 
contract did not mention 
anything about caring for 
penguins. Upset, he quickly 
called his supervisor and 
exp lained that he should not 
have to care for a penguin in 
addition to his other pressing 
respon. ibilities. The super-
VI 'or called his boss, who in 
turn called his boss. Theentire 
grounds department became 
involved in the dispute; if 
penguin care were to be a part 
of campus maintenance, a new 
contract had to be negotiated . 

AI 8 am, Vice Chancellor 
Watson was informed of the 
dispul e. Suspect ing a ruse 
perpetrated by the unions, 
Wat son quickly ca lled 
Chancellor Atkinson . 

"Dick. this IS Joe. I!.a\·e you 

heard abou t the penguin?" 
"joe, joe who?" Atkinson 

replied. 
"You know - Joe WATSON 

- the Vice Chancellor, " 
Watson answered. 

·'Oh yes, of course, ah which 
of our Penguins are you asking 
about''' Atkinson inquired. 

" We on ly hav one, and 
right now it's by the student 
center. We had better get a 
handle on the s ituation. If the 
La Jolla Town Council finds 
out about this , we can forget 
about our new sculpture 
funding," Watson added. 

"Who the hell ordered a 
penguin? I don 't remember 
approving any such reques t ," 
Atkinson lamented. 

"I don't know, maybe 
someone from the zoology 
department. I had nothing to 
do with it. " Watson whined . 

Atkinson _contemplated the 
Situation. He realized that as 
chancellor, he must diffuse all 
rumor s that could be 
damaging to the uni\,er..,it y. 
''' j oe, organize a press 
conference In my office for

That will really bring our bills 
down." 

" Don 't be such a worry 
wart ," said Mrs. Fred. "You 
know darn well our trickle· 
down check Will arrive any day 
now." . 

Fred had almost forgott en 
about the trickle-down . 

The President of the t rnlted 
States had promised it to hlln 
at the last c1ection_ 

Ju<.;t let the rich keep all their 
money instead of paying taxes 
and e\'eryhod~ will b<>nefit, the 
President had "aid. If YOU let 
the rich hang onto- their 
money, they \"ill go out and 
huy thing.., and build things 
and hire people tu do thing .... 

" And the mo ney will 
actuallv tnckle down to me'" 

Like scotch (J\er rocks, hIS 
President as,-u'red him. 

But here it was more than 
two years later and Fred's 
t rickie-down check had st ill 
not arrived. 

··Golly, it must be del ayed In

"Honey," said Fred. ' 'I'm

" We sold iI," Mr". Fred sald_ 
"I-Ia\·e a nice trip."

the man there said. "After·all

A penguin and the UCSD political system 
continued trom page 3 

Meanwhile, students 
started drifting onto campus 
preparing for their first class. 
Although the penguin was in 
plain view, no one seemed to 
notice it. 

Promptly at 9:30, the 
Chancellor started the press 
conference. 

"Just what is this penguin?" 
a reporter from the Los Angeles 
Times ·inquired. 

"Well, our reports tell us 
that it's a black and white bird 
that like cold weather and 
swims," Atkinson related . 

"I know that ," retorted the 
reporter. "What is it doing at 
this university?" 

" I am not at liberty to say," 
Atkinson anwered. "But I 
would like you to know that we 
are handling the situation. 
Presently we are organizing a 
task force that will maximize 
our available resoures within 
the current restraints imposed 
upon us." 

"If you can't tell us about 
the penguin, then why did you 
organiie this press confer-
ence?" a reporter from The 
Guardian asked. 

"To inform the press about 
the penguin," Atkinson 
answered in an annoyed voice. 
"But at this point in time we 
cannot tell you anything." 

After the press conference, 
the reporters were dismayed 
over the lack of substance in 
the Chancellor's position. 

"Hey," exclaimed one 
reporter. "Let's go to the AS 
Council. They're always good 
for a controversial quote. 

Maybe we can get a good story 
out of this after all." Everyone 
agreed and the group scurried 
to the AS offices. 

The reporters could not at 
first find any members of the 
AS Council. After more 
searching, they located a few 
council members in the Pub. 
The Council members said 
that they were unaware of the 
situation but promised to call 
an emergency meeting. 

The meeting lasted a half 
hour. The members as embled 
together to make a statement. 

"We are tired of the 
administration ignoring 
student's rights! " exclaimed 
the Commissioner of External 
Affairs. "Obviously the 
administration thinks it can 
put a penguin on this campu 
without consulting students. 
No way! The AS Council just 
passed a resolution directing 
all students to boycott classes 
until the administration 
swears to accept student input 
on all future penguin 
acq uisitions." 

The reporters were 
overjoyed at this display. Now 
they had enough controversy 
to merit a front page story. 

The penguin incident gave 
the council another opportun-
ity to defend students' rights. 
Unfortunately, action on 
other, less important issues 
such as student housing and 
fees was postponed until the 
penguin "crisis" was resolved. 

Around lunchtime, a crowd 
gathered on the hump next to 
the penguin. Few, if any 
students payed any attention 

to the penguin. Those handful 
of students who noticed the 
penguin thought that it was 
part of a '.'beerless" T.G. But 
the students did not bother the 
penguin; he cont inued to 
happily waddle around the 
hump. 

Throughout the afternoon, 
co llege counc ils ca lled 
emergency meetings. The 
Third College Council passed a 
resolution calling for an end to 
imperialism against penguins. 
The Muir College Council 
called for economic sanctions 
against the administration . 
The Revelle College Council 
discussed the issue for an hour 
and then po tponed any action 
unt il a poll could be taken at 
the next Ice Cream Social. The 
Warren Co\1ege council did not 
meet. Once more people began 
to wonder if the Warren 
Co\1ege Council really existed. 

At 2 pm, a group of students 
organized a protest. The 
students carried large banners 
which denounced inustice 
against penguins: "No More 
Imperiali m Against Pen -
guins," "Stop US Intervention 
Again t Penguins" and "Eat 
at the Che Cafe." 

By 3 pm, another dispute 
was brewing at The Guardian . 
Within the staff, two groups of 
edi tors debated over the choice 
of pictures to use on the front 
page of the next issue. One 
group wanted to use a picture 
of the Chancellor looking 
stupid while talking to 
reporters and the other group 
wanted to use a picture of the 
Chancellor looking stupid in 

general. The Opinion . 
c.olumnists ignored the 
penguin and wrote their usual 
boring columns. 

Late that night, as suddenly 
as it appeared, the penguin 
disappeared. Some students 
blamed its disappearance on a 
plot by the CIA. 

Although the penguin was 
gone, the cont r_oversy was on ly 

beginning. The administra-
tion made more statements 
while the AS Council passed 
more resolutions. After 
several st udent referenda, the 
Regents became involved. 

Some say that the day of the 
penguin was a milestone in the 
history of UCSD. Those whc 
are wiser realize that that day 
was only an average day.

EQUAL TIME __ 
The Soviets' 
nuclear view 
Moscow (TASS NEWS)-
Following is the Lext of the 
article "On the Question of 
Decency" published in the 
newspaper PRAVDA on 
December 19, 1982. 

The US Adminis tration 
issued a statement the other 
day attempting for the 
umpteenth time to give a 
distorted interpretation of the 
sta te of things at the talks on 
the limitation of nuclear 
weapons in Europe. 

[t i highly indicative that 
the statement by the White 
House emphasizes the claim 
that th e so-ca lled "ze ro-
option" on the question of 
medium-range nu c lear 
systems is the "best way" for 
reaching agreements in 
Geneva. At the same time it is 
well known that in reality the 
American "zero" has for a year 
now been blocking talks and 
can not serve as a basis for 
out lining any mutually 
acceptable decisions. 

If the USA " till believes in 
accordance with its "zero 
option" that it will ever be able 
to achieve a unilateral 
abolition of all Soviet medium-
range missiles, while the USA 
together with NATO does not 
give up a si ngle one of its 
aircraft, a single one of Its 
missiles, which is the gist of 
t he "zero opt ion ," it is high 
time, at last, to lake a sober 
look at things. There will be no 
unilateral di sarmament of the

oviet Union. He who 
continues clinging l naciously 
to the American "zero" does 
not want an agreement at 
Geneva. He wants a deploy-
ment of new American 
missiles in Europe and 
nothing more. And this must 
be said plainly. 

Washington knows well 
that the Soviet Union has 
never had and does not ha ve 
any monopoly in Europe as 
regards missiles. The NATO 
member countries - the alli es 
of the USA - have hallistic 
missiles and in considerahle 
numbers. It is an open secret 
against whom these missIles 
are dep loyed. Washington also 
knows well that the Soviet 
Union by no means strives for 
an advantage over the West as 
regards medium -range mean ' . 
Our proposals made at Geneva 
leave no doubt on that score. 
There is a balance as regard~ 
the medIUm-range means in 
Eu rope. and the Soviet l nion 
proposes to preserve it. but at a

The American side is again

prove blessing in disguise 

'New' theatre will present 'Skin of Our Teeth' 
By JOM fORSBtRG 

March 8. 1978. began as a 
tranquil spring morning in San 
Diego 's beautiful Balboa Park. 
the rosy fingers of dawn crept 
over the majestic Old Globe 
Theatre silhouetted against a 
backdrop of eucalyptus trees. 
Suddenly. furious flames and 
charcoaled smoke burst into the 
clear sky, Within minutes, the 
blaze from the arsonist's torch 
completely gutted this beloved 
San Diego institution. 

The catastrophic fire has 
become a blessing in disguise. 
Out of the smolderirlg ashes, the 
new $6.5 million Old Globe 
Theatre reopened as the Simon 
Edison Centre for the 
Performing Arts in January of 
1982. With the new name 
emerged one of America's finest 
professional repertory theatres. 
A rival of the Mark Taper Forum 
in los Angeles and the American 
Conservatory Theatre in San 
Francisco, the Old Globe 
Theatre attracts the leading 
actors. directors, and designers 
from Broadway. film and 
television. 

Now. in 1983. the Old Globe 
Theatre is again receiving 
national recognition with the 
first live telecast of a theatrical 
stage production in public 

Art fest 
next week 

Artfest '83, a UCSD art 
exhibition featuring multi-
media works by Gregory 
Redmond. Ma~orie Mowry and 
other university students will be 
on view Jan. 17 through 21 in 
the Mandeville Annex Gallery 
from 12 to 7 p.m. 

television history. Thornton 
Wilder's dynamic classic The 
Skin of Our Teeth will be aired 
live from the Globe stage on 
Tuesday. Jan. 18 at 6 pm as part 
of PBS-TV's weekly drama series. 
American Playhouse. 

Televised to millions of 
Americans coast-to-mast. this 
Pulitzer Prize-winning play 
features direction by Globe 
Artistic Director Jack O'Brien 
and performances by stage and 
screen star Harold Gould, Tony 
and Emmy-winning Sada 
Thompson. Blair Brown, Rue 
McClanahan. Monique Fowler. 
and Jeffrey Combs, Following 
the telecast. the production 
continues nightly (except 
Monday) at 8 pm with a 2 pm 
matinee on Saturdays and 
Sundays. through Feb. 13. 

The serio-comic The Skin of 
Our Teeth is Wilder at his best. 
Act I opens as the Ice Age hits 
suburban New Jersey. In the 
following two hours. Wilder 
humorously presents the 
history of the human race 
complete with everything from 
ancient dinosaurs to glitzy 
Atlantic City showgirls. Wilder's 
epitomic family. the Antro-

.buses, illustrates that, by 
working together. mankind 
survives each crisis. even if it is 

only by the "skin of its teeth." 
This celebration of the human 
spirit offers optimistic hope for 
the future of the American way 
of life in these troubled times 
when we are faced with threats 
of nuclear conflict and 
economic depression. 

Originally built for the 1935 
california Pacific International 
Exposition in Balboa Park. the 
Old Globe Theatre was modelled 
after Shakespeare 's Globe 
Playhouse in london. which. 
ironically, was also destroyed by 
fire in 1613 when a stage 
cannon ignited its thatched 
roof, 

Under the guidance of 
Executive Producer Craig Noel. 
the theatre became the home of 
the San Diego National 
Shakespeare Festival in 1949. 
During its 46 years of operation. 
many well-known actors have 
graced the Old Globe stage. 
among them Cliff Robertson. 
Marion Ross. David Odgen 
Stiers. Christopher Reeve, 
Daniel Travanti. Michael 
Learned. and the late Victor 
Buono. 

Along with the new Old 
Globe, the three-theatre Simon 
Edison c-omplex houses the 
adjacent cassius carter Center 
Stage . an intimate arena 

luair 8rown and Harold Gould star in 'The Skin of Our Teeth: 

theatre, and the outdoor 
Festival Stage. where audiences 
enjoy Shakespeare under the 
stars of warm summer evenings. 

Come spend an exciting 
evening at the Old Globe 
Theatre in Balboa Park and 
experience what local and 
national audiences and critics 
are raving about. As New York 
director John Houseman 
exclaims. " If you 've never been 
to the Globe. you 're ignoring 
professional theatre as intense. 
as exhilarating as America 's 
best. "

January n. L96J Hiatus .3 



lustln Hoffman's new movie, 
Toolsie. may help create a 
cultural change in the eighties 
the way John Griffin's book 
Black Uke Me contributed to 
the civil rights movement in the 
sixties. 

female like me: Hoffman 
tackles new role with style 

Tootsie. 
Michael's girlfriend Sandy 

(Teri Garrl helps us understand 
Dorothy's discovery of what it is 
like to be used by a man : " I 
don't take this kind of shit from 
a friend, maybe a lover, but not a 
friend. " In 1962, Griffin's book gave 

many Americans their first 
glimpse of what it would be like 
to live in this country as a black 
person. Griffin , a journalist 
knew he could not gain insight 
into being black if he resorted 
to a gross impersonation. He 
decided it was necessary to 
inject himself with a skin 
pigment drug which would force 
him to live as a black. not just 
play the role. 

Griffin's purpose was not to 
be black. nor to presume to be 
better able to express black 
issues or feelings. His intent was 
to show his reading audience 
how a person's values and 
attitudes might change if they 
had to live inside a different 
body. This new body came 
complete with a preconditioned 
set of social restrictions and 
public reactions to its 
appearance. 

While. living as a black 
person. Griffin discovered that 
non-blacks would interact with 
him as either a dumb person or a 
sexual curiosity. Only other 
blacks sought to discover his 
inner thoughts and feelings. 

Readers of Black Like Memay 
have at first been surprised by 
the story, but Griffin 's 
dedication to the situation 
inspired his readers to become 
involved in civil rights, to 
become one of the Brothers. 
Recently another human rights 
movement was rekindled, and 
another story has been created 
to help us understand what life 
would be like in a different 
body, to become one of the 
Sisters. The viewers of Tootsie 
will also discover some 
surprises, both within the movie 
and within themselves. 

when transformed into Dorothy 
Michaels, Dustin/Dorothy 
discovered a new awareness 
about himself and women. As 
Hoffman/Michael stated it : 
"Don't playa part that is not in 
you," and "One of the things you 
can do as an actor is 
compensate for the things you 
can·t do in life." 

The anecdotes surrounding 
the making of Tootsiereveal the 
parallel growth of Dustin and 
Dorothy. " My wife Lisa says that 
now when I take the wrong tum 
on the freeway or spill 
something, Ijust shrug it off like 
Dorothy instead of banging on 
things and cursing as I usually 
do. Lisa says Dorothy has made 
me more tolerant." As with 
Griffin in his book Hoffman's 
personal changes that came 

By CArtOU: 
about through the making ot 
Tootsie gi ves a credibi Iity to the 
movie. It also creates a reality 
which is believable and 
inspirational to the audience. 

So on one level. Tootsie can 
be viewed as an expose on 
acting. As an acting coach, 
Michael stressed that actors 
must perfect their memories 
and awareness of each 
experience for possible use in a 
future play. This creates an 
intensity , interest and 
introspection in each day of an 
actor's life. 

The movie warns those who 
act not to become excessive. 
Michael 's roommate says 
" Instead of trying to be Michael 
Dorsey the great actor, or great 
director, why not try becoming 
Michael Dorsey the person." 

This statement also becomes a 
hint into the difficulties Michael 
will experience when he 
transforms into Dorothy 
Michaels and tries to be 
recognized as a person. 

Hoffman's portrayal of 
Dorothy in Tootsie and of 
Michael as Dorothy in the TV 
soap opera within this movie is 
not the gross characterization 
we have seen in movies and TV 
of the past. Dorothy's words and 
actions on screen are not of a 
male trying to construct the 
image of a woman. What we see 
is Dorothy's challenging our 
culturally preconditioned and 
restricted image of women 
which prevents us from seeing 
the person within. 

The development of Dorothy 
is echoed by the other actors in 

Julie's father (Charles During) 
reflects Michael 's newly 
developing views about his own 
sex: "Sometimes I think they 
want to be men, as if we arc all 
equal, which we are not. " 

Michael's agent (Sydney 
Pollack, director of Tootsie) 
becomes the mechanism for 
looking at the frustrations and 
similarities of Michael the actor 
and Michael as Dorothy the 
woman: "I have plenty to say to 
women. I have had to sit by the 
phone waiting for a role. Then 
when they call I had to sit in a 
powerless position." 

Dorothy's TV co-star and 
Michael's love interest Julie 
(Jessica Langel.has a dual 
purpose. She represents the 
female who has stopped hiding 
herself and learned to stand up 
for her thoughts and feelings. 
Julie also opens Michael/Dor-
othy's eyes to the value and 
quality gained when we relate to 
each other as people and friends 
instead of just potential sexual 
partners. 

The evolution of Michael's 
character reveals how values 
and attitudes change as one 
becomes more familiar with the 
thoughts and feelings of 
another person. At first Michael 
uses his new knowledge to 
exploit the women in his life. 
These efforts fail as the women 
see through his manipulations. 

Then Michael begins to 
recognize he is more successful 
as Dorothy because she is 
becoming her own person, 
asserting her own personality 
without threatening others. 
Michael laments to his 
roommate " I think Dorothy is 
smarter than me." 

finally Michael realizes being 
Dorthy is not just another acting 
job. Even though he had learned 
many things from being 
Dorothy, he could no longer live 
under the constant restriction 
and cultural conditions of being 
a woman. He confesses to Julie: 

Dustin Hoffman is a method 
actor much in the same way 
John Griffin was a method 
writer. In method acting, the 
intent is to briefly become the 
person in the story, instead of 
just playing the part. This 
became an interesting situation 
for Hoffman because so much of 
his personality was written into 
the part of Michael Dorsey. But 

"I was proud to be strong enough to be a woman, Iwhich may be tile best part of my manhood." 
" I was a better man with you as a 
woman than I was when I was a 
man with a woman."

The new 
t:nglish 
dance Beat 
continued from page 1 

h .. • .. rI 
Originally from Birmingham. 

England, The Beat has been 
successful in their genre where 
their contemporaries have 
failed. In the case of The 
Selector and The Specials, a 
point was reached where they 
just could not continue. Without 
relying on any singular formula. 
The Beat however, has produced 
three excellent albums (I Just 
Can·t Stop It. Wha'ppen and 
Special Beat Service) that has 
caused them to gain an 
increasing following with each 
new LP. 

Presently, The Beat is 
comprised of Dave Wakeling on 
vocals and guitar. Ranking 
Roger on percussion and vocals. 
David Steele on bass and banjo, 

Andy Cox on guitar, Wesley 
Magoogan on sax and Dave 
Blockhead on keyboards. While 
the fifty year old-plus 
saxaphonist Saxa played on the 
previous Beat albums, he is no 
longer a part of the bands 
touring entity due to the strains 
that touring puts on his health. 

The music that the Beat 
purveys is decidedly different 
from the traditional main-
stream rock found on the 
airwaves in America. What the 
Beat has been instrumental in 
bringing about is a new breed of 
dance music. This may be the 
cause of their success. Most 
importantly. however, The 
Beat's music is fresh. The thick 
beat and lyrical content aims at 
bringing about a change in a 
world of inequality. 

The Beat's music expresses 
both a sense of equality as well 
as strong unified creativity. Uke 
other " two-tone" bands, the 
Beat has bridged the gap 
between racial differences. In 
Brimingham, racial integration 
is the norm, due to the large 
immigrant population from 
Jamaica and Asia. Lead vocalist 
Dave Wakeling notes " It wasn 't 
until we started moving around 
as a band, playing cities outside 
of Birmingham, that we realized 
that racial integration wasn ·t 
just somethi ng to be taken for 
granted." 

-------....-. 
At their recent appearance in 

San Diego, drummer Everett 
Morton and sax player Wesley 
Magoogan talked to Hiatus, 

Hiatus: Having never been to 
Jamaica , what were your 
feelings about playing in the 
Jamaican festival? 
[verett JIIorton: It was an 
experience. I've been waiting for 
so many years to go back to the 
West Indies and just going to 
Jamaica reminded me of the 
part I came from. I quite enjoyed 
it, you know, the sun, the beach. 
I didn't go in the water you 
know. 'cause I can't swim 
(Iaughterl. I quite enjoyed being 
back in the West Indies. I mean 
like I've seen the way Americans 
live. I've seen the way the 
English live. I can't really 
remember the way the West 
Indians live in their own 
country, so like I enjoyed going 
back there, 
Wesley JIIagoogan: It was 
good, but I think the hotel was 
kind of like a holiday camp and 
it seemed a bit pretentious from 
that point. I enjoyed it quite 
much. I went .to sec the actual 
village of Montigo Bay; it was 
great. The only thing is that 
there arc either very rich or very 
poor people in Jamaica, but as 
unfortunate as it is, the poorer 
areas actually make up the 
character of a country. Where 
the real people are living there 
is a tremendous amount of 
character, from that point of 
view I guess it was tremendous. 
Except they all thought we were 
stinking rich and ran to us like 
bees to a honey pot. 
Morton: Yeah , you walk 
around with a different accent 
and they think " this man has 
got money,"

Hiatus: Will Saxa be playing 
on any of the upcoming Beat 
tracks? 
l"Iagoogan: I hope so. If he's 
well enough. 
l"Iorton: That's why he's not 
touring - because of his 
health. It just got to be too 
much for him so he just had to 
pack it in. He won't tour 
anymore. He s not well at al l. We 
played a show just two miles 
from his house and he didnt 
even come down. 

Hiatus: Do you feel that your 
music is still in gear with the 
youth in England? 
l"Iorton: I think that the 
youth in England give us a rest 
really because you know in 
England they produce so many 
bands that Engl ish people 
always like to keep moving 011 
to something new. 
l"Iagoogan: It's not so much 
keeping up with music; it's just 
a rap id change of menu. 
Morton: They 're into new 
image. You know, I think they'll 
give us a listen again and find 
that we are more mature in the 
music. 
l"Iagoogan : I think that 
people in England over the pac;t 
ten years have had it with 
allowing certain bands to not 
become as popular as they \Vere 
and a year or so later they were 
suddenly more popular than 
they were before. Which is sort 
of peculiar but ovu here 
(America) since it's so big, I 
guess it lasts a bit longer. 
Morton: It just takes so long 
to reach eve rybody ( i n 

America). 
Hiatus: Through your music. 
you seem very politically. 
econom ically. and socially 
concerned. What would you 
think the ideal world wou ld be 
like? 
Magoogan: I don·t t hink 
there is such a thing. 
Hiatus: Well. what wou ld you 
see in the world that would 
make you happy? What would 
make you say Okay, this is 
where we belong?" 
Magoogan: I don't think we 
can ever have that. I think there 
will always be certain countries 
that will establish themselves as 
lea ders , economically . I 
suppose that what will happen 
(is that \ computers will , or they 
already have done, start the 
equivalent of the industrial 
revol ution and they are going to 
have to economically rethink 
the entire work week. You might 
have a two day working week 
and be paid for a full one. You 'll 
probably have to employ a lot 
more people and therefore 
productivity will probably be 
higher because it you 're only 
working two days a week, you 'lI 
work a lot harder anyway. 
The}' ve done that with a firm in 
Germany. There was a strike 
because they were going to 
computerize a dock and let a 
whole load of guys go. So what 
they did was try an experiment. 
They had the guys working a 
three day week for the ~me 
wages as a six day week : two 
twelve hour days and one ten

Jeatitude 
Rk: Ocasek 
Geffen 

Ric Ocasek. with the release 
of his "rst solo LP, Beatitude. 
profoundly defies pure 
description ... or, at least that is 
what it seems when one tries to 
place him somewhere within the 
limiting boundaries of today's 
deftly rigid musical def1nitlon 
scheme. A5 the leader and chief 
songwriter-singer of the 
tremendously successful 
"dance band" The Cars, Ocasek 
has proven again and again, to 
the horror of some critics. that 
true new wave can transcend 
pop, and vice-versa. without 
losing the beneficial qualities of 
either.

many of the images conveyed well as the more bizarre sounds

basic assumptions about 
Ocasek have been dismissed by ' 
the album as well . most notably 
that he isn 't capable of dishing 
out commendable material 
intended for a wider audience 
than the sophisti cated 
prepubescents who were so 
enthralled by his bouncy top ten 
"Shake It Up" ph i1osophy. 

What remains to be seen Is 
whether or not he can infuse 
such slashing skepticism into 
the tightly prod uced cars. 
Beatitude outshines most of 
Ocasek's earlier work, and is a 
welcome sight in an otherwise 
conventional post-Christmas

first 1983 
show Thurs. 

Atomicafe. UCSD's ongoing 
forum for the presentation of 
new music, will present their 
first concert of 1983 this 
Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. in the 
Mandeville Recital Hall. 

Concerning new music . 
American composer Charles 
Wuorinen once asked. "How can 
you make a revolution when the 
revolution before last has 
already said anything goes?" Or. 
how do you write new music 
that still sounds new? 

This Atomicafe concert will 
present the works of six student 

free concert 
With Beatitude, Ocasek 

cunningly continues from where 
The Cars' four platinum albums 
left off, though focusing on the 
darker side of post-industrial 
Americana in the process. rather 
than simply allowing the "good 
times" to blindly roll. This, 
however. much to the credit of 
Ocasek, is done without leaving 
the insistant streams of 
electrOllic pop. which he first 
charted in the late seventies 
with The Cars ' in effably 
fascinating first two albums. 

behind the ominous choked 
Ocasek vocals cast a darker 
shadow than most Cars fans 
might expect. 

Tops in Pops composers in the UCSD music department: six quite different 
definitions of what new music 
is. six quite different answers to 
Wuorinen 's question. 

Beatitude. however. still has 
its share of Ocasek 's voiced 
helplessness in the face of 
feminine presence. "Something 
to Grab For" (perhaps a fast 
version, or better said, a faster 
version of "Candy-O"). " Prove." 
and the sultry " I Can't Wait. " all 
echo the incapability of the 
modem male to compete with 
the stealthy, if not completely 
temperate. side of the female 
persona. Of couse, Ocasek is 
able to deliver such conceptions 
without becoming pretentious; 
every track of the album ( likeall 
four releases by The cars) is

,~ One of the ways new music 
,,- has kept its sound fresh, "new" 

}, is through the introduction of 
t.i:; musical elements that had 
"\, previously been ignored. These 

," were often elements of a 
popular or ethnic nature. 
Ragtime was an invigorating 
force in the early neoclassic 
works of Stravinsky, and the 
music of the German cabarets 

; filtered into the scores of such 
composers as Weill . Berg. 
Schoenberg, and Krenek.

Two classic films in Mandeville 
--.AT THE MOVIES 

By CLYDfrt[ rt[[ 
The Winter fifm Series starts 

off this week with two classic 
films from Japan , Seven 
Samurai and lIarakiri. After the 
unification of the Japanese 
empire in 1568. the need for 
vast armies of samura i warriors 
was no longer necessary. and 
the majority of these warriors 
became ronin, hired assassins. 
who wou ld sell their serv ices to 
the highest bidder. It is in this 
context, the Edo-Tokugawa 
period from 1568-1868, that the 
two fi Ims take place. 

seven Samuraiwas one of the 
first films made by interna-
tionally acclaimed director 
Akira Kurosawa. Made in 1951. 

it tells the tale of seven ron in 
who have been hired by a group 
of peasants to protect them 
from bandits who plague their 
vlllage. 

This film won international 
recognition and many awards 
when i t was first released. and 
was later adapted to the 
American screen into the now 
c lassic The l'1agnificent seven. 
The origi nal film holds many 
unique cinematographic 
techniques that have become 
t he tra de-mark of Akira 
Kurosawa. and show the high art 
of film-making. 

Harakiri is the product of 
Japanese film maker Masak i 
Kobayashi, who uses the

Men netters hope to continue 
Triton volleyball tradition 1 Athlete ~. of the 

Week 
By ROBIN DEARBORN 

Staff Writer 
Although men 's volleyball 

coach Doug Dannevik says he 
doesn't "know what to expect" 
of the upcoming season with 
his relatively young club, he 
looks forward to coaching 

. them because inherent in their 
youth is an eagerness to better 
themselves that was absent 
from hi s previous squad. 
Because the '82 and '83 clubs 
are so dissimilar the brand of 
ball this year's team wi ll play 
will change considerably, but 
Dannevik is quick to point out 
that neither playing style is 
more or less effective than the 
other. 

Dannevik points to the 
roster changes as the source of 
the method alterations . In the 
past, the team has played a 
" power game," using high 
outside sets to utilize the 
strength rather than the 
quickness of the players. The 
result was a slow but potent 
offense. This year Dannevik 
plans on running a faster 
offense that involves short 
sets utilizing the speed of his 
new team. 

From the '82 squad, which 
consisted of seven seniors, two 
juniors, one sophomore and 
two freshmen, five are 
return ing. In these five 
Dannevik is looking for the 
bulk of his starting six, 
although he has not made any 
definite choices _ The 
returnees include two seniors: 
Jim Bishop, an outside hitter 
with what Dannevik calls an 
"overa ll steady front and back 
row game," and Chip Yo hiro, 
a setter who will be the key to 

their 5·1 offense. Retu rning Dannevik 's pas t four a t

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Writers 
A final look at the highs and lows in 1982 for UCSD 

athletics . .. 
HIGH - The men's rugby team placing third in the college 

playoffs and finishing with an impressive 4·2 record. 
LOW - The public ridicule Rita Uribe went through when 

she accused former softball coach Dan Monteverde of 
physically threatening her. Instead of being applauded 
for having the courage to step forward , Uribe was 
constantly harassed by those who wouldn't bel ieve her 
story. 

HIGH - Coach Trey Conrique leading the women's soccer 
team to one of the school 's best marks ever at 6·1·4. 

LOW - Head Coach John Block havingtogivealmost all of 
his salary (roughl y $2400) to Assistant Coach Tom 
Marshall in order to keep Marshall on staff. 

HIGH - Marshall staying with Block, and devising a 1·2·2 
match·up zone and a tough man·to·man defense that is 
largely responsible for the Triton s' early Sllccess this 
sea 'on . 

LOW - Athletic Director Judy Sweet unable to hire a 
tennis coach because she can 't promise any job security 
or reasonable pay due to the incredibl y low athletic 
budget. 

HIGH - Dave Hammond and Scott Hill having the 
ingenuity to start their own lacrosse team after 
realizing that none existed becuase there was no coach. 
Conducting practices on their own, Hammond and Hill 
started the program off with not a whimper but a bang, 
walloping a strong San Diego State team 7·2. 

LOW - San Diego State Head Coach Smokey Gaines 
avoiding UCSD on hi s 1982·83 schedule because the 
Tritons might be one of the best Divis ion lfI teams 
around, and State couldn't afford an early season 
defeat. 

HIGH - Vicki Barker making first team AII·American for 
the Triton women's water polo team . 

HIGH - Barbara Lee , Lee Morrow, and Maureen 
Kavanaugh being named AII·Americans for the 
women's swimming team . 

HIGH - Men's and women's swim coach Bill Morgan 
having the ability to make 10 swimmers All ·American . 

HIGH - Probably the most prestigious team of all, the 
UCSD ultimate fri s bee squad won the first 
championship in UCSD history when they captured 
the Horizontal Bowl at Cal Poly on the weekend of May 
7·8. 

On Monday: We ve1/ture back to our origil/al format.

watched the 41·38 Chargers jump·ahead, fall· 
behind, come·back victory over Miami one year

of the greatest games ever played. 

You can bet Miami was rooting for a Jets 
upset over the Bengals last weekend so they 
could get a chance at revenge vs. San Diego in 
this year's playoff quarterfinals. These 
Dolphins are even better than last year's group. 
and take pride in wha t was stati81ically the 
best pass defense in football thi eason. But 
Mi am i didn 't play any of the three teams with 
the league's best passing offenses .. San Diego, 
Cincinnati, San Francisco .. during the regular 
season, so this game wi ll test the Miami 
secondary against the thunder of Air Corvell. 

San Diego's pass defense IS deftnlteh I/ut the 
best to football. but the group ' played

Will be coming off one of his be~t games of hl~ 
career 06 of 19. 246 yards) and will probably 
pick apart the Chargers secondary for much of 
the game. Rut not all of the game. 

Although redundant to repeat. turnovers 
will agato be important in this game. Neither 
team can afford to fumble the openmg kickoff 
and fall toto a 7·0 hole after 12 seconds

facility sit quiet during the day when it could 
easily be used , at least temporarily. until the ne\\ 
lecture halls are completed. 

Students s hould not be asked to attend lectures 
at 7 am , as is the case of some Physics 2B 
students this quarter. It pose a difficulty for 
many who have to get up at 5:30 am to ride the 
bus to school. How efficiently will that lecture 
time be u ed if the students can 't even be awake 
enough to listen? 

We believe that the lack of pace is an unfair 
burden on students. An overcrowded univer ity 
cannot run at its utmost efficiency, The number 
of students s hould be controlled - it i making 
life difficul t for those that are already here, And

'1n a word, heres what 
strong AFSCME/UC 
representation can 
give us in 1983: 

"Protection:' 
UC San Diego Grounds Department 
Equipment Operat or 

Times are tough. 
And they promise to get tougher in 1983. 

Layoffs have already begun at some UC campuses and 
hospitals. And the UC system has sent its budget to the Legislature without 
even proposing pay increases for staff employees. 

Experienced UC employees know that we will bear the 
brunt of budget cuts. Unless we protect ourselves. 

That's why thousands of UC employees have joined 
AFSCME/ UC. We know that AFSCME is the fastest-growing UC union because 
it has the strength to protect us when we need it most. Right now. 

AFSCME'S Bargaining Skill Will Mean 
Better Job Security for UC Employees 

With layoffs and budget cuts threatening us, UC 
employees need a union that can win better job security in contract talks. 

AFSCME's strength and experience in negotiating con-
tracts is Number 1. Their skilled negotiators have won better pay and job 
security for public employees throughout California and in the university 
systems of seven other states. 

We need that strength and experience now as we never 
have before. And we need it right away. 

So join with us in voting for AFSCME/UC in the up-
coming union representation elections. To make our job security the 
Number 1 priority in contract talks, we need the union that's Number 1 in 
collective bargaining .
